BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-associated mortality is increasing at an alarming rate, and there is a readily identifiable cohort of at-risk patients with cirrhosis, viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and diabetes. These patients are candidates
for chemoprevention. Metformin is an attractive agent for chemoprevention because it is inexpensive, has a favorable safety profile,
and is well tolerated over long time periods. METHODS: The authors studied the efficacy of metformin as a prevention agent in a clinically relevant rat model of HCC, in which tumors develop in the setting of chronic inflammation and cirrhosis. Repeated injections of
diethylnitrosamine were used to induce sequential cirrhosis and HCC, and metformin was administered at the first signs of either fibrosis or cirrhosis. RESULTS: Prolonged metformin exposure was safe and was associated with decreases in fibrotic and inflammatory
markers, especially when administered early at the first signs of fibrosis. In addition, early metformin treatment led to a 44% decrease
in HCC incidence, whereas tumor burden was unchanged when metformin was administered at the first signs of cirrhosis. It is noteworthy that activation of the hepatic progenitor/stem cell compartment was first observed at the onset of cirrhosis; therefore, only
early metformin treatment suppressed receptor for advanced glycation end products and inhibited the activation of hepatic progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: The current results are the first to demonstrate an effect on progenitor/stem cells in the setting of chemoprevention and provide further rationale to explore metformin as an early intervention in clinical trials of patients with chronic liver

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.1 The incidence of
HCC is rising in the United States, and the increase in mortality from HCC is more rapid than in any other malignancy.2
Treatment options are limited, and outcomes remain poor, particularly in the setting of advanced disease. Hepatocellular
transformation generally occurs in the presence of chronic liver injury, often as a sequela of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Increasingly, diabetes and obesity have emerged as important risk factors for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which, together, are thought to account for 37% of HCC cases not associated
with viral hepatitis.3 In contradistinction to several other malignancies, there is a readily identifiable cohort of patients at
high risk for HCC who are candidates for chemoprevention as a means to reduce HCC incidence and mortality.
Metformin is the most commonly prescribed drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Over the last decade, several
pharmacoepidemiologic studies have strongly suggested a decreased incidence of multiple cancer types, including HCC,
in diabetic patients who receive metformin,4,5 as well as improved outcomes.6,7 The mechanism of action of metformin as
an antihyperglycemic appears to be mediated by indirect effects leading to inhibition of complex I of the respiratory transport chain.8,9 However, a growing body of preclinical data has introduced several other potential mechanisms for its anticancer and cancer-preventive effects.

Metformin Prevents Liver Cancer/DePeralta et al

It is noteworthy that the primary site of action of
metformin is within the liver, where it functions to promote a state of energetic stress, thereby decreasing gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis as well as systemic insulin
and glucose levels, if they are elevated at baseline. Diabetics harbor at least a 2 to 3 times increased risk of
developing HCC,10,11 and clinical data support an association between long-term metformin exposure and a
reduction of hepatocellular transformation to levels
approaching those observed in nondiabetic patients.12-17
This inexpensive and extremely well tolerated agent has
been reported to exert antineoplastic effects in cell culture and animal models through both direct effects on
the cancer cells and indirect, host-mediated, and often
insulin-dependent mechanisms. Common themes
include induction of metabolic stress, which may or may
not be mediated by 50 -adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inflammatory and
immune-mediated effects18,19 and, more recently, inhibitory effects on cancer stem cells.20,21
Despite an explosion of preclinical data, only a few
studies have explored the effects of metformin in the context of HCC. Some studies have reported direct effects on
HCC cell lines, mainly AMPK-mediated cell cycle arrest
at G0/G1.16,22 However, these experiments were performed at a very high doses (10-20 mM), which would be
roughly 500 to 1000 times more than the peak plasma
concentrations observed in diabetic patients receiving
metformin for glycemic control. Another study used a
single-dose diethylnitrosamine (DEN) mouse model,
which induces liver tumorigenesis in the absence of cirrhosis, and reported an impressive 57% decrease in the
number of liver tumors in animals that received metformin.23 These indirect effects appeared to be mediated by
AMPK-independent inhibition of hepatic lipogenesis. It
is unknown whether these findings are reproducible
when HCC develops in the setting of chronic liver disease
and/or cirrhosis, as is typically the case in humans. Therefore, in the current study, we explored metformin as an
agent of chemoprevention when administered at the first
signs of either fibrosis or cirrhosis in a rodent model of sequential fibrosis, cirrhosis, and HCC that more closely
resembles human disease at the biochemical, histologic,
and molecular levels.24

Animal Experiments

Male Wistar rats (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, Mass) were housed in accordance with the guidelines
of the Massachusetts General Hospital Subcommittee on
Research Animal Care and received humane care according to the criteria outlined in the Guide for the Care and
Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Academy of Sciences. Rats were subjected to either control phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) or low-dose 50 mg/kg DEN (Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Mo) as an intraperitoneal
injection once per week over the course of 18 weeks. PBS
control rats began treatment with metformin by oral gavage at 8 weeks, whereas DEN-injured rats began treatment with metformin by oral gavage either at 8 weeks or
12 weeks (n 5 9 for each group). At the time they were
killed, the rats were anesthetized and sedated. A terminal
blood collection was performed by cardiac puncture, and
livers were removed for measurement of weight, snapfrozen for further analysis, or fixed in formalin for
histology.
Serum laboratory analysis

A cardiac terminal blood withdrawal was performed at the
time animals were killed. Blood was allowed to clot for 2
hours at room temperature before centrifugation at 2000
revolutions per minute for 10 minutes at 48C. Serum was
isolated and stored at 2808C before to use. Serum levels
of several biochemical markers, including alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (Alb), glucose (Glu), and
triglycerides, were measured as previously described
(DRI-CHEM 4000 Chemistry Analyzer; Heska AG,
Basel, Switzerland).24
Histology and immunohistochemistry

Formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, cut
into 5 lm-thick-sections, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E), Masson trichrome, and Sirius red
according to standard procedures. Trichrome-stained sections were analyzed to score the amount of fibrosis according to the method of Ishak et al.25 The collagen
proportional area was morphometrically quantified on
Sirius red-stained sections with image-processing software
(ImageJ; National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md).
Additional sections were stained with an antibodies specific for receptor for advanced glycation end products
(RAGE), d-like homologue 1 (DLK-1) (both from
Abcam, Cambridge, Mass), and OV-6 (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, Minn). All slides were reviewed blindly by
the same liver pathologist.

Western blot analysis

Livers were homogenized and protein was extracted in
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (Boston BioProducts, Ashland, Mass) containing protease and phosphatase
inhibitors (Sigma Chemical Company). Protein concentrations were normalized to 40 lg using the bicinchoninic
acid method (Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Ill).
Samples were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a
polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
Mass). Immunoblotting for total AMPK, phosphorylated

Adipokine array

Liver lysates from PBS control animals and DEN-injured
animals that were treated with or without metformin were
prepared as described above. Protein concentrations were
determined using the bicinchoninic acid method, and 3
samples from each group were pooled together. Two hundred micrograms of pooled protein from each group were
analyzed with a commercially available rat adipokine array
(ARY016; R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This array determines the relative
expression of 30 proteins implicated in adipogenesis.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) protein expression
was quantified in both liver tissue and serum using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
system (R&D Systems) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Each sample was quantified in triplicate, and
experiments were repeated to ensure accuracy.

RESULTS
Metformin Is Well Tolerated and Reduces
Hepatic Fibrosis and Carcinogenesis

We used a carcinogen-based model of recurrent liver
injury to investigate the effects of metformin on the development of HCC in a cirrhotic microenvironment. On the
basis of our previous results,24 rats subjected to weekly
DEN at a low dose (50 mg/kg) develop fibrosis after 8
weeks, followed by cirrhosis at 12 weeks, with substantial
HCC development after 18 weeks (Fig. 1a). Therefore,
metformin (250 mg/kg once daily by oral gavage) was
administered to PBS control rats beginning after 8 weeks
and to DEN-injured rats after either 8 weeks or 12 weeks.
Although metformin significantly (P < .05) decreased
body weights by 12.3% in PBS controls, there was no
change in total body weight in DEN-injured rats that
were treated with metformin (Fig. 1b). It is noteworthy

Figure 1. Early metformin treatment inhibits hepatocellular tumorigenesis in a cirrhosis model. (a) Rats received weekly intraperitoneal diethylnitrosamine (DEN) to induce sequential fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Control rats
received saline (phosphate-buffered saline [PBS]). PBS control rats received daily treatment with metformin by oral gavage after
8 weeks (PBS 1 Metformin), whereas DEN-injured rats received metformin treatment either after 8 weeks (DEN 1 Metformin
Early) or after 12 weeks (DEN 1 Metformin Late), coinciding with the onset of fibrosis or cirrhosis, respectively. The rats were
killed at 18 weeks (n 5 9 for each group). (b) Total body weight and (c) the number of surface tumors were measured for each
animal at the time they were killed. Serum levels of (d) alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and (e) aspartate transaminase (AST) were

that metformin afforded a significant (P < .01) 44%
decrease in the number of surface tumors when administered after the first signs of fibrosis (metformin early) (Fig.
1c). By comparison, metformin did not decrease liver tumor development when administered after the first signs
of cirrhosis (metformin late). Overall, metformin was well
tolerated and did not increase markers of liver injury,
including ALP (Fig. 1d) and AST (Fig. 1e).
Macroscopically, the livers from PBS controls
treated with or without metformin appeared normal,
whereas the livers from DEN-injured rats appeared cirrhotic (Fig. 2a) and contained many HCCs (Fig. 2b). It is
worth noting that only the livers from DEN-injured rats
that received metformin early were less fibrotic (Fig. 2a).
In fact, explanted livers from DEN-injured rats that
received metformin early had consistently diminished collagen deposition as assessed by Sirius red staining
Cancer

(Fig. 2a). Morphometric quantification of these stains
revealed that early metformin treatment significantly (P <
.01) decreased collagen deposition by 57% (Fig. 3a).
However, there was no measurable difference in Ishak
scores as assessed by Masson trichrome staining (Fig. 3b).
This discrepancy between quantitative collagen deposition and Ishak score after metformin treatment is
consistent with a previous report.26 In addition, only
DEN-injured rats that received metformin at the early
time point exhibited marked improvements in serum total
bilirubin (Fig. 3c) and albumin (Fig. 3d) levels, which
also suggests some mitigation in the burden of chronic
liver disease. Finally, there was also a trend for less inflammation after early metformin treatment (Fig. 3e) as
assessed by H&E staining (Fig. 2a), but this difference did
not reach significance (P 5 .06). However, we did observe
that metformin, especially when administered early,

Metformin Does Not Suppress Hepatic
Lipogenesis in the Setting of Cirrhosis

There is variability within the literature concerning
whether AMPK, the metabolic checkpoint and energy
sensor, is activated by metformin treatment, particularly
when metformin is used as an antineoplastic agent in nondiabetic models. AMPK controls several metabolic processes, including fatty acid and protein biosynthesis. With
respect to HCC, one group reported AMPK activation
(phosphorylation) in HepG2 and Hep3B cells treated
with very high metformin dosing (20 mM),16 whereas
AMPK activation actually decreased in the liver after metformin treatment in a single-dose DEN mouse model of
HCC in the absence of cirrhosis.23 In the current study,
1220

we also noted decreased AMPK activation in rat livers
from PBS controls after treatment with metformin (Fig.
4a). By comparison, in the setting of DEN-induced cirrhosis, p-AMPK increased dramatically with metformin
treatment (Fig. 4b). Total AMPK levels remained stable
in all animals and did not account for differences between
groups. Although published work in a noncirrhotic mouse
model demonstrated no metformin-mediated activation
of AMPK, it did demonstrate decreased ACC and
SREBP-1c expression. Therefore, it was suggested that
metformin prevents HCC development in these noncirrhotic animals by inhibiting the pathways driving hepatic
lipogenesis.23 We also observed decreased mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, the key transcription factor driving the
expression of fatty acid synthesis enzymes, but not protein
levels of ACC, the rate-limiting enzyme involved in fatty
acid synthesis, in livers from our PBS control rats that
received metformin (Fig. 4a,c). However, SREBP-1c
mRNA and ACC protein levels were also down-regulated

in DEN-injured livers, suggesting that lipogenesis may already be diminished during chronic liver injury (Fig. 4a,c).
It is noteworthy that metformin treatment did not further
decrease their expression in cirrhotic rat liver. Metformin
did increase p-ACC, the inactive form of the enzyme,
which is thought to be phosphorylated by activated
AMPK. However, we did not observe any significant differences in serum triglyceride levels between the different
groups (Fig. 4c). Taken together, our results are different
from those reported in noncirrhotic livers23 and suggest
that mechanisms other than diminished hepatic lipogenesis
are also responsible for the decreased incidence of HCC.
Therefore, we examined whether DEN-induced
chronic liver injury had any effect on organic cation transporters 1 (OCT1 or SLC22A1) and 3 (OCT3 or
SLC22A3), which are responsible for the uptake of metformin. Western blot analysis of SLC22A1 and SLC22A3
revealed that their expression was not altered by DEN
(Fig. 4a). In addition, metformin treatment did not alter
their expression.

Metformin Decreases RAGE Expression

Given the numerous proposed mechanisms of action for
metformin, next, we took a broad approach and examined
the expression of several growth factors, chemokines, and
cytokines using a commercially available adipokine array.
We analyzed protein expression in normal livers from
PBS controls, cirrhotic livers from DEN-injured rats, and
livers from DEN-injured rats treated with metformin at
either the early time point or the late time point. Several
known mediators of inflammation and fibrogenesis were
up-regulated in DEN-injured rats; and, in general, early
administration of metformin reduced the expression of
these proteins. However, the major observed effects of
early metformin treatment were on the expression of
RAGE and DLK-1 (Supporting Figure 2; see online supporting information). It is noteworthy that RAGE is a
known soluble mediator of oval cell activation, and DLK1 is a prototypical marker for oval cells. Oval cells represent a class of bipotential hepatic progenitor cells, which
are activated during severe hepatic injury, have the

potential for self-renewal, and can differentiate into both
hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. In humans, these bipotential hepatic progenitor cells are markedly elevated in
the setting of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis,27
and their activation appears to correlate with HCC
incidence,28 tumor progression,29 and resistance to
chemotherapy.30
Previously, it was demonstrated that RAGE ablation
significantly inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis in a multidrug resistance Mdr22/2 model of chronic liver injury
through the suppression of oval cell activation.31 Therefore, we decided to verify the effects of metformin on
RAGE expression in the DEN rat model. Consistent with
the adipokine array, RAGE mRNA expression was elevated in DEN-injured livers and was significantly (P <
.01) decreased by 86% or 59% after early or late treatment
1222

with metformin, respectively (Fig. 5a). It is worth noting
that we also stained liver sections for RAGE and observed
increased expression in DEN-injured livers that was only
inhibited by early metformin treatment (Fig. 5d). Because
RAGE exists in transmembrane and soluble forms, we
also examined protein expression in both liver lysates and
serum by Western blot analysis. Again, RAGE expression
was elevated in DEN-injured animals and was suppressed
by early metformin treatment (Supporting Figure 2; see
online supporting information).

has been demonstrated that oval cells exhibit stronger proliferation and tumorigenicity, possess the potential for
self-renewal, and possess stronger properties of chemoresistance compared with their DLK-1–negative counterparts.32 We confirmed the effects of metformin on oval
cell activation by examining the mRNA expression of
DLK-1 and CD44, another marker of hepatic progenitor
cells. DLK-1 was barely detectable in normal livers, but its
expression increased dramatically in DEN-injured livers
and decreased by 84% or 89% after early or late treatment
with metformin, respectively (Fig. 5b). Likewise, CD44
was also barely detectable in normal livers, and its expression increased dramatically in DEN-injured livers and

with metformin, respectively (Fig. 5c). We also performed
immunohistochemistry for oval cells using antibodies for
DLK-1 and OV-6, a well characterized oval cell antigen.
Both DLK-1 and OV-6 stained oval cells in the portal
tracts, as expected, and the staining increased with DENinduced fibrosis (Fig. 5d). It is noteworthy that, similar to
the results with RAGE, these regions of marked ductular
reaction were only decreased by early administration of
metformin.
Because late administration of metformin also
decreased the mRNA expression of DLK-1 and, to a lesser
extent, of RAGE and CD44 (Fig. 5a-c), we examined the
expression of these markers at the time points when metformin treatment was initiated. It is worth noting that,

although small increases in RAGE and CD44 mRNA levels were observed after 8 weeks of DEN treatment (fibrosis), the expression of RAGE, DLK-1, and CD44
increased by 3.4-fold, 188-fold, and 129-fold, respectively, after 12 weeks of DEN treatment (cirrhosis). Next,
we examined the expression of RAGE, DLK-1, and OV-6
by immunohistochemistry in livers from rats that were
injured with DEN for either 8 weeks or 12 weeks.
Although RAGE staining and activation of oval cells, as
assessed by DLK-1 and OV-6, were minimal at 8 weeks,
they dramatically increased at 12 weeks with the onset of
cirrhosis (Fig. 6d). Therefore, these data suggest that,
although late administration of metformin can still reduce
the mRNA expression of DLK-1 and CD44 as well as
some markers of fibrosis and inflammation (Supporting
Figure 1; see online supporting information), its ability to
1224

prevent HCC requires early administration before the
dramatic activation of hepatic progenitor cells with the
onset of cirrhosis. Overall, our results suggest that early
metformin treatment suppresses the expression of RAGE,
a soluble mediator of oval cell activation, and thereby
reduces HCC development.
DISCUSSION
Current therapeutic options for patients with HCC
remain limited, and an effective chemoprevention strategy
is one of the most viable means of curbing rapidly increasing mortality rates worldwide. Epidemiology studies have
indicated that each year of metformin use is associated
with an incremental decreased risk of HCC in diabetic
patients.16 It is noteworthy that we observed a reduction
in HCC incidence by 44% when metformin was

administered for 10 weeks (during weeks 9-18), but no
reduction was observed when metformin was administered for 6 weeks (during weeks 13-18). Of note, Tajima
et al observed that metformin decreased HCC incidence
when administered concurrently with a high-fat diet for
60 weeks; however, metformin failed to protect against
liver tumorigenesis if treatment was delayed until week
30.33 Although the efficacy of metformin probably
depends both on the amount of underlying disease present
at the time of treatment and on the duration of treatment,
our current study definitely provides further evidence that
early and long-term treatment with metformin is a promising strategy in the prevention of tumors within the liver:
its main site of action.34
In the majority of patients, primary liver cancer
arises in a cirrhotic microenvironment. Therefore, it is
crucial to consider the field effects of a chronically injured
liver when evaluating the efficacy of any proposed prevention agent. Of the animal models currently available,35 we
have demonstrated that the low-dose DEN rat model
with recurrent DEN administration closely recapitulates
human hepatocarcinogenesis with the development of fibrosis (8 weeks), cirrhosis (12 weeks), and ultimately
HCC (18 weeks).24
The mechanism of the metformin-mediated
decrease in HCC development is almost certainly multifactorial and includes modulation of inflammatory and
fibrotic mediators within the surrounding liver milieu.
Although metformin did not have a measureable effect on
the Ishak score, there was an unquestionable decrease in
the volume of both periportal fibrosis and web-like collagen deposition between portal tracts visible by staining in
animals that received metformin. This effect was quantified by Sirius red staining and is also supported by
metformin-mediated decreases in the mRNA expression
of COL1A1 (Supporting Figure 1; see online supporting
information).
Despite a growing body of literature on the topic,
the mechanism of action of metformin as an antineoplastic agent remains controversial. It is generally believed
that metformin exerts its effects thorough the inhibition
of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, with
a resultant increase in the ratio of AMP and ADP to ATP.
It is believed that this triggers activation of the liver kinase
B1 (LKB1)/AMPK pathway, with downstream inhibitory
effects on protein and fatty acid synthesis.18 The importance of this pathway becomes difficult to interpret in the
setting of cirrhosis. However, we indeed did demonstrate
significant activation of AMPK in response to metformin
treatment in surrounding liver tissue with subsequent

inactivation of ACC: the rate-limiting step of de novo
lipogenesis. Although Bhalla et al reported inhibitory
effects of metformin on hepatic lipogenesis in a noncirrhotic mouse model (single-dose DEN),23 it is unlikely
that metformin-mediated effects on fatty acid synthesis
meaningfully contribute to HCC prevention in the setting
of chronic liver injury and cirrhosis based on our findings.
It is worth noting that metformin also did not change levels of lipogenic genes, including SREBP-1c, in a high-fat
diet model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.33
Another commonly proposed mechanism of action
that explains the efficacy of metformin as an antineoplastic agent is through indirect effects on tumor cells resulting from diminished levels of insulin, IGF-1, and
glucose.18 However, based on the analysis at the time animals were killed, metformin did not alter liver or circulating levels of IGF-1, and serum glucose levels did not
change in response to metformin treatment in this nondiabetic model (Supporting Figure 3; see online supporting information).
Expansion and activation of the hepatic progenitor
cell compartment is widespread in chronic liver disease;
and, although a direct causal relation linking oval cells
and hepatocarcinogenesis has not been proven formally, it
is generally agreed that oval cell activation initiates or promotes HCC.36-39 it is intriguing to note that the multiligand receptor RAGE, a known driver of chronic
inflammation-associated and diabetes-associated complications, was identified as a key regulator of oval cell activation and tumor development in an mdr22/2 model of
inflammation-associated liver carcinogenesis, as reported
by Pusterla et al.31 In that model, RAGE ablation led to a
marked reduction in oval cell activation and impaired tumor development. In addition, several studies have implicated RAGE in the development of chronic liver damage,
inflammation, and fibrosis.40,41 Our findings confirm
RAGE overexpression in cirrhotic rats; and we report, for
the first time to our knowledge, a metformin-associated
decrease in RAGE signaling in a preclinical cancer model.
Recent evidence has linked the antineoplastic effects
of metformin not only in the liver42 but also in the
breast20,43 and pancreas44,45 to its ability to target subpopulations of cancer stem cells within these tumors. Within
the liver, multiple studies have identified stem cell
markers in primary HCC, and these tumors are associated
with increased recurrence and worse survival.46-48
Although our model is best suited to address the possibility of using metformin as a prevention agent, further work
is needed to assess whether metformin could be used in
combination with current chemotherapeutics in the

treatment of established HCC. Preliminary data assessing
combination therapy with metformin and doxorubicin in
HepG2 and Hep3B xenograft models are promising.16
Currently, a search for “metformin and cancer” on
clinicaltrials.gov yields 199 ongoing or recently closed
clinical trials assessing the efficacy of metformin both as
an agent for chemoprevention and as a chemotherapeutic.
The majority of these trials are investigating breast, pancreatic, lung, prostate, and colorectal cancer, but not a single trial is examining the effects of metformin on primary
liver tumors. This is somewhat surprising, because the primary site of action of metformin is within the liver. Preclinical studies focusing on metformin and liver cancer
have also lagged behind other tumor types, with few studies currently published in the literature. Our data offer
additional evidence in support of ongoing research efforts
investigating the antineoplastic effects of metformin in
the treatment and prevention of HCC.
