Abstract
Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) is a non-tyrosine kinase receptor frequently overexpressed in various malignancies, where it has
been implicated in promoting many protumorigenic behaviors,
such as imparting therapeutic resistance to metastatic cancer
cells. Here, we report a novel function of NRP2 as a regulator of
endocytosis, which is enhanced in cancer cells and is often
associated with increased metastatic potential and drug resistance. We found that NRP2 depletion in human prostate and
pancreatic cancer cells resulted in the accumulation of EEA1/
Rab5-positive early endosomes concomitant with a decrease in
Rab7-positive late endosomes, suggesting a delay in early-tolate endosome maturation. NRP2 depletion also impaired the
endocytic transport of cell surface EGFR, arresting functionally

active EGFR in endocytic vesicles that consequently led to
aberrant ERK activation and cell death. Mechanistic investigations revealed that WD-repeat– and FYVE-domain–containing
protein 1 (WDFY1) functioned downstream of NRP2 to promote endosome maturation, thereby inﬂuencing the endosomal trafﬁcking of EGFR and the formation of autolysosomes
responsible for the degradation of internalized cargo. Overall,
our results indicate that the NRP2/WDFY1 axis is required for
maintaining endocytic activity in cancer cells, which supports
their oncogenic activities and confers drug resistance. Therefore,
therapeutically targeting endocytosis may represent an attractive strategy to selectively target cancer cells in multiple malignancies. Cancer Res; 76(2); 418–28. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

lines (1, 3, 5, 7–10), and it is implicated in promoting their
proliferation, survival, and migration (11). It is also important in
maintaining the tumor initiating population of breast cancer
(12). Interestingly, NRP2, but not NRP1, maintains its protein
level during metabolic stress, such as nutrient starvation and
hypoxia, suggesting that it has a potential role in stress (13). We
have previously observed a survival-promoting role of NRP2 in
cancer cells during therapeutic stress (14, 15). Our ﬁndings
corroborated an earlier report, where depletion of NRP2 in colon
cancer cells increased their death during hypoxia (16).
In this article, we report a novel function of NRP2 in cancer
cells. Our results suggested the role of NRP2 in regulating the
maturation of endocytosis. Although this function can provide
the underlying mechanism of the role of NRP2 in regulating
autophagy during therapeutic stress (14, 15, 17), NRP2-regulated
endosome maturation is also important for the proper function of
cell surface receptors, which require endocytic trafﬁcking to maintain optimum activity. Previously NRP1 was indicated to regulate
endocytosis of tyrosine kinase receptors such as VEGFR2 (18, 19).
It has been shown that upon ligand binding, VEGFR2 and NRP1
undergo endocytosis as a complex. NRP1 has a C-terminal PDZbinding site, which helps its interaction with a protein called
synectin that links VEGFR2–NRP2 complex to myosin-VI motor
proteins. NRP1 therefore helps VEGFR2-containing endosomes
to move away from the plasma membrane. NRP1 also helps
endocytosis of CendR peptides or membrane lytic peptides such
as K8L9 and melittin (19–21). Recently, NRP1 has also been
implicated in the internalization of the Epstein–Barr virus
into the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells (22). In all these

Neuropilins (NRP) are transmembrane, nontyrosine kinase
receptors. Often, they function as coreceptors to modulate various cellular pathways including angiogenesis, cellular communication, and migration (1, 2). Neuropilin-2 (NRP2), a member
of the NRP family of receptors, has a similar molecular mass and
structural domain to its family member neuropilin-1 (NRP1;
ref. 3). In addition to its role in neuronal development, NRP2
is important for the development of capillaries and lymphatic
vessels (4, 5). The known binding ligands for NRP2 are VEGF-C,
VEGF-D, VEGF-A, and semaphorin-3F (6). Importantly, NRP2 is
also expressed in various human cancer tissues and cancer cell

NRP2 Axis and Endosome Maturation

circumstances, the receptors, peptides and the virus particles that
are endocytosed, directly interact with NRP1 at the cell surface,
which facilitates their internalization during endocytosis. This
process is distinctly different from our current ﬁndings where
NRP2 axis is involved in the maturation of late endocytic vesicles.
We have also identiﬁed WD-repeat– and FYVE-domain–containing protein 1 (WDFY1) as a downstream of the NRP2 axis. Few
studies have been reported on WDFY1. A recent study indicated
WDFY1 as a potential candidate of chronic pancreatitis (23).
Interestingly, WDFY1 has been shown to recruit signaling
adaptor TRIF to Toll-like receptors (TLR3 and TLR4), and thereby
potentiating signaling necessary for the initiation of innate
immune system (24). WDFY1 has also been considered as a
potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (25) and can be
involved in placental development and for the maintenance of
hematopoietic stem cells (26). In this study, we are reporting a
novel NRP2–WDFY1 axis, which are important for the maintenance of endocytic activity in cancer cells. Recent evidence indicates that altered endocytosis promotes aberrant cell surface
receptor signaling in cancer cells, either by expediting their recycling to the cell surface or by enabling a different receptor
signaling program from the endosomal compartment (27, 28)
We speciﬁcally focused on how the NRP2 axis regulates the
trafﬁcking of EGFR in cancer cells. Interestingly, our results
indicated that the inhibition of the NRP2 axis would lead to the
accumulation of ligand-stimulated EGFR in early endosomes and
then initiate an apoptosis-promoting signal. Therefore, inhibitors
of NRP2 should show a potent antitumor effect in cancer cells
with activated EGFR signaling.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, plasmid constructs, and transfection reagents
Two metastatic human prostate cancer cell lines [PC3 (CRL1435;
ATCC) and Du145 (HTB81; ATCC)] and one pancreatic cancer
cell line CaPan1 (HTB-79, ATCC; kind gift from Dr. Michael
Hollingsworth, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha,
NE) that express high levels of NRP2 and VEGF-C were used for
the experiments described here. Wild-type WDFY1 (RC509030;
Origene), NRP2 (RC220706, Origene) plasmids were used to overexpress these proteins in cancer cells. To deplete the VEGF-C, NRP2,
and WDFY1, siRNAs against VEGF-C (L-012071-00-0020; Dharmacon RNA Technologies; #LQ-012071-00-0005; Qiagen), NRP2
(L-017721-00-0010 and LU-017721-00-005; Dharmacon), and
WDFY1 (L-017721-00-0010; Dharmacon) were transfected in cancer cells using Dharmacon reagents (T-2005-02; Dharmacon).
Western blot, ELISA, isolation of membrane protein
Western blot and ELISA were performed using established
techniques (see Supplementary materials). For isolation of
cell membrane fractions, cells were washed and homogenized in
ice-cold lysis buffer (25 mmol/L HEPES, 100 mmol/L NaCl,
1 mmol/L ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, pH 7.4, and protease
inhibitor cocktail) in a glass Dounce homogenizer for 30 to 40
vertical strokes. The homogenized lysate was then subjected to
centrifugation (800 g for 10 minutes) to remove cell debris and
isolate the nucleus (pellet). The supernatant was then subjected
to ultracentrifugation (108,000 g for 1 hour at 4 C) and
membrane (pellet) and cytosolic (supernatant) fractions
were collected. The pellet was resuspended in urea buffer
(70 mmol/L Tris–HCl, pH 6.8, 8 mol/L urea, 10 mmol/L

www.aacrjournals.org

n-ethylmaleimide, 10 mmol/L iodoacetamide, 2.5% SDS and
0.1 mol/L dithiothreitol) at 37 C for 15 minutes. Proteins were
analyzed using Western blot with the following antibodies:
LC3B (2775; Cell Signaling Technology), Rab5 (2143; Cell
Signaling Technology), Rab7 (9367; Cell Signaling Technology), Caveolin (3238; Cell Signaling Technology), Myc-Tag
(2276, Cell Signaling Technology), EGFR (4267, Cell Signaling
Technology), phosphor-ERK (4370, Cell Signaling Technology), ERK (4695, Cell Signaling Technology), PARP (9532, Cell
Signaling Technology), EH-domain–containing protein 4
(EHD4; ab153892, Abcam), NRP2 (#sc-13117; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology; AF2215, R&D System), Rho-GDI (sc-360; Santa
Cruz), Cathepsin B (sc-6493; Santa Cruz), Cathepsin D (sc10725; Santa Cruz), Cathepsin L (sc-6498; Santa Cruz), EEA1
(sc-33585; Santa Cruz), phosphor-EGFR 1173 (sc-12351, Santa
Cruz), PIKfyve (sc-100408; Santa Cruz), WDFY1 (123058;
GeneTex Inc. and SAB2106120, Sigma-Aldrich).
Confocal and electron microscopy
Cells were grown on poly-DL-lysine–coated coverslips (BD
Biosciences) for 72 hours before ﬁxation and confocal analysis.
Cells were rinsed with Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline
(DPBS; Invitrogen), followed by ﬁxation with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 minutes. Later, cells were washed
with DPBS and treated with ice-cold methanol for 20 minutes at
20 C. Finally, cells were blocked using 1% BSA and 0.2%
saponin. All confocal images were captured using a Zeiss 710
Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (equipped with four lasers),
and data were analyzed and processed with the Zeiss Zen 2010
software.
For electron microscopy, cells were cultured in 25-mm polyD/L-lysine–coated coverslips (BD Biosciences) and ﬁxed with
2% glutaraldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) containing 2% para-formaldehyde solution in 0.1 mol/L Sorensen's Phosphate Buffer
(Sigma-Aldrich) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed
by vigorous washing with 0.2 mol/L HEPES, pH 7.4, at room
temperature for 1 hour. Samples were post-ﬁxed in 1% osmium
tetroxide, aqueous solution (Sigma-Aldrich), for 30 minutes.
Samples were washed 3 times in buffer, followed by dehydration with 50%, 70%, 90%, 95%, and 100% ethanol. The
dehydrated samples were then passed through a series of
graded Araldite/ethanol mixtures, (1:2, 1:1, and 2:1; SigmaAldrich), before being embedded onto Araldite blanks and
stored at 65 C overnight for polymerization. Next, cell culture
colonies were excised and adhered to an Araldite blank block
for thin sectioning. Thin sections were collected onto 200 mesh
copper grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate (SigmaAldrich) and Reynolds lead citrate (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections
were examined on an FEI Tecnai G2 TEM (FEI Company)
operated at 80 kV.

Results
Inhibition of the VEGF-C/NRP2 axis prevents the formation of
autolysosomes from autophagosomes
We previously reported regulation of autophagy by NRP2 in
cancer cells (15, 17). To explain the underlying mechanism,
autolysosome formation was monitored in human prostate
cancer PC3 cell lines stably expressing LC3B-tagged GFPmCherry protein following depletion of NRP2. An approximately 52% reduction in the formation of autolysosomes

Simultaneous depletion of WDFY1 and NRP2 rescue autophagy inhibition. Autophagic activity was detected using confocal microscopy for PC3 cells that
stably expressed GFP-mCherry-LC3B plasmids after 48 hours of transfection either with scrambled, siNRP2 or with siNRP2 and siWDFY1 simultaneously. The
percentage of autophagosomes (yellow puncta; autophagosomes vs. sum of autolysosmes and autophagosomes per ﬁeld) was quantiﬁed and is represented
graphically. Scale bar, 20 mm. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Images within the boxed region were magniﬁed to show the distribution of autophagosomes
(yellow) and autolysosomes (red).

(Red Puncta) was observed in NRP2-depleted cells compared
with scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1). This became
even more apparent after continuous monitoring of autophagosome and autolysosome formation in the stable clones using
time-lapse video microscopy (Supplementary video S1). Moreover, transmission electron microscopy analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1A) revealed that after NRP2 depletion, the number of
electron-dense autophagosomes (indicated by yellow arrows)
increased compared with controls. These results suggest that
inhibition of the NRP2 axis delays the formation of autolysosome and thus, slows the lysosomal degradation of the sequestered cargo.
Effect of expression of WDFY1 on the formation of
autolysosomes
We previously reported that expression of WDFY1 increases
after depletion of either NRP2 or its ligand VEGF-C (15). We
hypothesized that WDFY1 acts downstream of NRP2 in regulating the formation of autolysosomes. Simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and WDFY1 partially rescued defective autophagosomal maturation, as detected using confocal imaging
(Fig. 1). Western blot measured the autophagic ﬂux and
veriﬁed the ﬁndings of the confocal imaging (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Our ﬁndings therefore indicate that WDFY1, as a
downstream target of the VEGF-C/NRP2 axis, prevents the
formation of autolysosomes.
The role of the NRP2/WDFY1 axis in endosome maturation
PC3 cells showed the presence of WDFY1 in EEA1-positive early
endosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1C); a similar observation was
also previously reported for WDFY1 (29). We hypothesized that
the NRP2/WDFY1 axis regulates endosome maturation and thereby regulates the formation of autolysosome. An increase in EEA1positive puncta in NRP2 and VEGF-C–depleted cells were
observed, suggesting an increase in early endosome number
(Fig. 2A). Although the circularity of the puncta remained
unchanged, mean diameter of the individual EEA1-positive

420 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

puncta often increased in siNRP2- and siVEGF-C–treated cells
(Fig. 2B), indicating a defect in the maturation of EEA1-positive
early endosomes. Simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and WDFY1
partially restored the defect in EEA1-positive puncta, thus supporting the hypothesis that WDFY1 acts as downstream of NRP2
in regulating endocytosis (Fig. 2A and B). Similar to EEA1,
depletion of NRP2 increased the number and size of puncta that
were positive for Rab5, another early endosome marker (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Once again, simultaneous depletion of NRP2
and WDFY1 restored the wild-type phenotype for Rab5-positive
vesicles. Similar to PC3, Capan1 (pancreatic cancer cell line) and
Du145 (prostate cancer cell line), which maintain higher expression of endogenous NRP2, also showed similar defect in early
endosomes following NRP2 depletion (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and S2B). Once again, simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and
WDFY1 rescued the defects caused by NRP2 depletion alone
(Supplementary Fig. S2B). To rule out the off-target effect of
siRNAs, we exogenously expressed NRP2 in siNRP2-transfected
cells and recovered the wild type phenotype of early endosomes
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2C). Overexpression of full length
NRP2 in siNRP2-transfected cells downregulates the WDFY1
protein in the basal level (Supplementary Fig. S2D), indicating
that upregulation of WDFY1 abrogates the endosomal function
and acts downstream of NRP2 axis.
To determine if deregulation of the NRP2 axis can affect late
endosomes, vesicles that were positive for the late endosome
marker Rab7 were examined. Interestingly, depletion of NRP2 or
VEGF-C reduced the Rab7-positive puncta (Fig. 2C). The control
phenotype was once again restored either after simultaneous
depletion of NRP2 and WDFY1 or by overexpressing full length
NRP2 in all the cell lines (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3A–
S3C). Knockdown efﬁciency of NRP2 in PC3 cells was shown
in Fig. 2D.
To conﬁrm the observations made during immunostaining,
immunoblot analysis of the total cellular and membrane fraction
was conducted to identify functionally active endosomal markers.
Here, after depleting either VEGF-C or NRP2 (Fig. 3A), an

increased level of membrane-associated EEA1 and a simultaneous
decrease in membrane-bound Rab7 were observed. No change in
the total cellular content of EEA1 and Rab7 proteins occurred
(Supplementary Fig. S4A–S4C shows the efﬁciency of knockdown
of VEGF-C and NRP2 in PC3). A similar increase in the level in
membrane-bound EEA1 was observed using two independent
VEGF-C and NRP2 siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S4D and S4G).
Results from RT-PCR and ELISA show the relative knockdown
efﬁciency of the individual siRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S4E, S4F,
and S4H). Similar to PC3, Du145 showed the similar phenotype
in immunoblot where membrane-bound EEA1 increases and
Rab7 decreases following the knockdown of NRP2 (Supplementary Fig. S4I).
Finally, following NRP2 knockdown, membrane recruitment
of FYVE-domain–containing phosphoinositide kinase (PIKfyve)
was also assessed. PIKfyve is recruited during the maturation of
early to late endosomes and synthesizes PtdIns-3, 5-P2 from
PtdIns-3-P (30). Both immunoblot and immunostaining analyses
showed a decrease in active membrane-bound PIKfyve (Fig. 3B
and C and Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, the total PIKfyve

www.aacrjournals.org

remain unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S5B and S5C). Together,
these results suggest that inhibition of the NRP2 axis alters the
transition of early to late endosomes. Notably, autophagosomes
often merge with late endosomes to form amphisomes prior to
fusing with lysosomes (31). We therefore propose that, following
inhibition of the NRP2 axis, the decrease in late endosomes
interferes with the crosstalk between autophagosomes and mature
endosomes, which in turn, delays the formation of autolysosomes.
Depletion of NRP2 in cancer cells and delayed transfer of
cathepsin cargos from early to late endosomes
To further validate that depletion of the NRP2 axis affects
endosome maturation, the Golgi-to-lysosome trafﬁcking of various cathepsins was examined. Cathepsin precursors are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), trafﬁcked to the Golgi
apparatus, and reach the lysosomes through the early–late endosome–lysosome maturation process (32). We postulated that,
following disruption of the NRP2 axis, a decrease in the number of
late endosomes will enhance the accumulation of cathepsincontaining cargo in early endosomes. Following knockdown of

the NRP2 axis, a signiﬁcant increases in cathepsins in EEA1positive vesicles (yellow and greenish-yellow puncta) were
observed (Fig. 4A and B and Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B).
In contrast, simultaneous knockdown of NRP2 and WDFY1 in
PC3 and Du145 cells resulted in reduced accumulation of cathepsin-positive puncta in early endosomes (Fig. 4A and B and
Supplementary Fig. S6A–S6C).
Cathepsins become mature and catalytically active within the
acidic pH of the late endosome and lysosome (32). Therefore, we
expected a reduction in the mature cathepsins in the cell following
NRP2 depletion. Western blot analyses revealed decreased levels of
mature cathepsin D and B following the depletion of NRP2 (Fig.
4C), indicating that maturation of cathepsin was hindered. Interestingly, simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and WDFY1 rescued the
level of mature cathepsins (Fig. 4C). Overall, these results indicate
that blocking of early to late endosome maturation inhibits the
delivery of certain lysosomal enzymes like cathepsins (33).
The underlying mechanism of NRP2/WDFY1 axis–regulated
endosomal trafﬁcking
The EHD4 protein is a regulator of endocytosis and is located in
early endosomes (34). Endogenous depletion of EHD4 has been
shown to result in a similar increase in EEA1- and Rab5-positive
early endosomes, with a concomitant defect in trafﬁcking of cargo
from early to late endosomes and lysosomes (34). Considering
that a similar defect in endocytosis was observed following the
depletion of NRP2, the potential crosstalk between NRP2 axis and

422 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

EHD4 was examined in prostate and pancreatic cancer cells. A
decrease of membrane-bound EHD4 occurred when NRP2 was
depleted (Fig. 5A); the total level of EHD4 remained unchanged
within the cancer cells (Fig. 5B). Further, immunostaining of
EHD4 showed a signiﬁcant decrease in EHD4-positive peripheral
puncta following the depletion of NRP2 in both PC3 (Fig. 5C and
D) and Capan1 (Fig. 5E) cell lines. The EHD-positive puncta were
rescued either by simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and WDFY1
(Fig. 5C) or overexpression of full length NRP2 (Fig. 5D and E).
Our results indicate that NRP2 maintains WDFY1 expression in
the cell and thereby regulates the level of EHD4 in the membrane,
thus inﬂuencing the endocytic pathway in cancer cells.
Depletion of the NRP2 axis and altered trafﬁcking of cell surface
receptors
Cancer-promoting functions of several cell surface receptors
depend on their ability to endocytose within the cell. EGFR is one
such tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors, which is often overexpressed and mutated in cancer cells. EGFR controls cancer cell
proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis
(7, 35). In a recent report, it has been suggested that EGF-induced
chemotactic migration of metastatic cancer cells depends on their
ability to coordinate the endocytosis of EGFR (36). Functionally
active endocytosis can carefully regulate the availability of EGFR
and other cell adhesion molecules on the cell surface, which is
required for the directionality and magnitude of the migration of
metastatic cancer cells. Therefore inhibition of endocytosis

NRP2 Axis and Endosome Maturation

Figure 4.
Depletion of NRP2 inhibits endocytic trafﬁcking of cathepsins. Colocalization of cathepsin (red) with early endosomal marker EEA1 (green) was analyzed with
either depletion of NRP2 alone or depletion of WDFY1 and NRP2 simultaneously for cathepsin D (A) and cathepsin B in PC3 cells (B). Scale bar, 50 mm. DAPI
was used for nuclear staining. Quantitation of the immunostaining data is represented graphically.  , signiﬁcant statistical difference with P values < 0.001.

imparts a negative effect on chemotactic cell migration. Interestingly, NRP2 is also known in regulating the migration of neuronal
and endothelial cells (37). Many metastatic cancer cells that
express signiﬁcantly high level of NRP2 also showed higher
activity for EGFR such as metastatic prostate cancer cells, glioblastoma, and breast cancers (38–40). NRP is also known to
modulate the downstream signaling axis of EGFR (41). We
therefore speculate that the implication of inhibiting the NRP2
axis would be to deregulate the endocytic process of EGFR in
cancer cells and therefore hinder its tumorogenic activity.
An EGFR internalization assay was performed in PC3 cells
following a brief exposure of its ligand EGF and the role of NRP2
axis in EGFR endocytosis was investigated. As shown in Fig. 6A–C,
EGF exposure to PC3 cells led to internalization of EGFR in
control cells; over time, the internalized EGFR was transported
to lysosomes and then mostly degraded within 5 hours after EGF
stimulation. However, in NRP2 knockdown cells, a sufﬁcient
amount of EGFR still remained after 5 hours chase following
EGF exposure, indicating a delayed degradation of EGFR (Fig. 6A).
Immunoblot analysis indicated that these internalized EGFR
remained phosphorylated (Tyr 1173) and thus active even after
5 hours of EGF stimulation following NRP2 depletion (Fig. 6B).
Moreover, we found that most of these EGFR-positive vesicles

www.aacrjournals.org

remained colocalized within EEA1 after 5 hours of EGF stimulation following the overexpression of WDFY1 (Fig. 6C and
Supplementary Fig. S7A), suggesting an extended presence of
EGFR in the early endosomes. Similar results were observed in
CaPan1 (Fig. 6D) and Du145 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7B),
which further supported the results obtained from PC3 cells.
In order to test whether inhibition of NRP2 can delay the
trafﬁcking of other receptors, we monitored the transport of
transferrin (TF) receptor following the NRP2 knockdown. Similar
to EGFR, TF receptor was present in the EEA1-positive (Fig. 6E)
early endosomes for prolonged period. Our result, therefore,
suggested that depletion of the NRP2 axis affects the recycling of
TF receptor to the plasma membrane.
In summary, our results indicate that depletion of NRP2
interferes with the cargo sorting at early endosomes and thereby
inhibits both lysosomal delivery and trafﬁcking of cell surface
receptors.
Sustained EGF-induced ERK phosphorylation and cell death

conditions, we observed an increased ERK phosphorylation in
both the cell lines, following the depletion of either NRP2 or
overexpressing WDFY1 (Fig. 7A–C). Previous reports indicated
ERK phosphorylation by functionally active EGFR when present
in early endosomes for an extended time period (36). We also
observed a signiﬁcant increase in active EGFR (pEGFR 1173) in
EEA1-positive early endosomes located in the perinuclear region
in NRP2 knockdown PC3 and CaPan1 cells (Fig. 7D and E),
suggesting the presence of endosomal active EGFR over a prolonged period due to the depletion of the NRP2 axis. Earlier
reports indicated that prolong intracellular EGFR signaling was
often responsible for the induction of apoptosis (36, 42); where
hyperactivation of ERK was described as an underlying mechanism of apoptosis induction. Therefore, we tested whether NRP2
depletion in EGF-stimulated cancer cells can induce death. Following EGF stimulation, we observed a signiﬁcant increase in
apoptotic death in NRP2-depleted cancer cells (Fig. 7F and G). An
increase in PARP cleavage under NRP2-depleted condition further
conﬁrmed induction of apoptosis in EGF-stimulated cancer cells
(Fig. 7H and I). Overall our results suggest that inhibition of NRP2

424 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

in prolonged EGF-stimulated cancer cells arrests the phosphorylated EGFR in early endocytosed vesicles, inducing ERK-driven cell
death.

Discussion
Overall, we propose a novel function of the NRP2 axis in
cancer cells. The increases in EEA1- and Rab5-positive puncta
and simultaneous decreases in Rab7-positive puncta in siNRP2or siVEGF-C–treated cells suggest a defect in the maturation of
early endosomes. This was further supported by observations
that depletion of the NRP2 axis caused accumulation of cathepsin-containing cargos in early endosomes, and decreased PIKfyve recruitment to the membrane. Autophagosomes often
merge with late endosomes to form amphisomes prior to fusing
with lysosomes (31). We, therefore, propose that, following
inhibition of the NRP2 axis, the decrease in late endosomes
interferes with the crosstalk between autophagosome and
matured endosomes, which, in turn, delays the formation of
autolysosomes.

NRP2 Axis and Endosome Maturation

Depletion of NRP2 arrests cell surface receptors in early endosomes following brief stimulation with EGF. Following activation with EGF (20 ng/mL for 15 minutes at
37 C), EGFR (green) degradation was monitored over time. A, immunostaining was performed to monitor the EGFR trafﬁcking at various time intervals
following NRP2 depletion in PC3 cells. Scale bar, 20 mm. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Insets, the magniﬁed images of cells at each time point. B, PC3 cells were
doped with 20 ng/mL EGF for 15 minutes at 37 C. Following this incubation, media was replaced with normal growth media for chasing the status of phospho-EGFR
and total EGFR at various time intervals. PC3 cells were lysed at each time point and immunoblot was performed to compare the status of phospho-EGFR
and total EGFR following depletion of NRP2. C, following WDFY1 overexpression, EGFR degradation was monitored for more than 5 hours time period after
EGF activation. Early endosome marker EEA1 was counterstained with EGFR (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Colocalization of internalized EGFR with EEA1 was
quantiﬁed in control and WDFY1 overexpressed samples at various time points following the EGFR chase and is represented here as a bar graph.  , signiﬁcant

the media containing the TF was replaced with the normal growth media. Recycling pathway of TF was monitored using early endosome marker EEA1 (green).
Colocalization of TF and EEA1 was quantiﬁed and represented graphically. Line graph indicates the pattern of EEA1 and TF colocalization after 45 minutes
of chase. DAPI was used for nuclear staining. Scale bar, 50 mm. Inset was magniﬁed to show the trafﬁcking of TF at various time points.  , the differences
were signiﬁcant (P ¼ 0.003, 0.005, and 0.0001 for 10, 20, and 45 minutes, respectively).

We hypothesized that WDFY1 acts as a downstream regulator of the NRP2 axis as its expression increases after
depletion of either VEGF-C or NRP2 (15). The ability of
simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and WDFY1 to restore the
defect in endosome maturation supports our hypothesis.
Although, limited information is currently available on
WDFY1, a study by Arisi and colleagues suggested that
WDFY1 is a potential biomarker for Alzheimer's disease
(25). Because deregulation of autophagy is linked to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (25), the potential
role of WDFY1 in inhibiting autophagy, as suggested here,
may explain this connection.

The decrease of membrane-bound EHD4 suggests that the
function of EHD4 becomes defective after the NRP2 axis is
inhibited. Considering that EHD4 is an important regulator in
the transport of cellular cargo from early to late endosome
(34, 43), the ability of NRP2 to regulate the function of EHD4
can be considered as an underlying mechanism for how the NRP2
axis regulates endocytic maturation. The rescue of the EHD4positive puncta by simultaneous depletion of NRP2 and
WDFY1 indicates that WDFY1 is important for the cellular regulation of EHD4. We speculate that an optimum level of EHD4
is needed in the membrane for its proper function, and the
NRP2/WDFY1 axis thereby regulates the membrane level of

Prolonged exposure to EGF following NRP2 depletion induces cell death. Immunoblot was performed to analyze ERK phosphorylation following either NRP2
depletion or overexpressing WDFY1 under continuous exposure to EGF (20 ng/mL at 37 C for 48 hours) in both PC3 (A and B) and Capan1 (C) cells. Colocalization
of phosphorylated EGFR 1173 (red) with EEA1 (green) was analyzed following 48 hours exposure to EGF in both PC3 (D) and Capan1 (E) cells under NRP2
knockdown conditions. Inset was magniﬁed and split into corresponding channels to represent the individual and merged images. DAPI was used for nuclear
staining. Scale bar, 20 mm. Cell death was assayed using confocal microscopy, following EGF exposure for indicated time points using YO-Pro, propidium
iodide, and Hoechst dyes in PC3 (F) and Capan1 (G) cells. Immunoblot was performed for cleaved PARP to analyze the induction of cellular apoptosis upon
EGF exposure in the NRP2 depletion state for both PC3 (H) and Capan1 (I) cells.

EHD4, which inﬂuences the transition from early to late endosomes. WDFY1 strongly interacts with the PtdIns-3-P, which
is an important membrane lipid of endocytic vesicles. It is possible that increased presence of WDFY1 in the membrane
inhibits the recruitment of EHD4, a hypothesis needs to be
tested in future studies. As the NRP2–WDFY1–EHD4 axis has no
inﬂuence on cargo delivery to early endosomes, they become
enriched with the incoming cargos with large vesicular structure.
Therefore, NRP2 depletion can cause signiﬁcant defect in receptor
trafﬁcking especially in cancer cells. Due to delayed turnover,
endocytosed receptors can be activated in early endosomes for a
prolonged period, which can promote an aberrant receptor
signaling.
We have shown that tyrosine kinase receptor, EGFR is present
in the early endosomal compartment of cells for an extended
period following the depletion of NRP2. Sustained activation of
EGFR in this early endosomal compartment has been shown to
stimulate apoptosis and therefore can be detrimental to metastatic cells (36). Currently, several anti-EGFR drugs are approved
by the FDA; however, a mixed outcome has been reported. It has
now been well documented that spatial localization of EGFR is
important for maintaining metastatic behavior of cancer cells.

426 Cancer Res; 76(2) January 15, 2016

Plasma membrane-bound EGFR has been shown to promote
the cell survival by activating antiapoptotic AKT pathway as well
as induce the migration and proliferation by upregulating the
Ras–MAPK pathway. The maintenance of this spatial distribution is also important for maintaining its Ras-driven tumorigenicity. However, the internalized EGFR or endocytosed EGFR
reverting the signaling cascade and is responsible for cellular
apoptosis. It has been shown that, therapeutic efﬁcacy of Cituximab, an anti-EGFR drug, induces EGFR endocytosis to perturb
its cytotoxic effect. Moreover, chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy was
increased in the presence of internalized EGFR and the drugs
that induce or arrest internalized EGFR actually had a better
efﬁciency in chemotherapy outcome (35, 36, 44). In this context, we here showed that depletion of NRP2 arrested the
internalized EGFR in early endosomes. It thereby caused hyperactivation of ERK signaling and induced cell death. Thus, NRP2
depletion can be a potential mode of therapy for cancers with
prominent EGFR signaling cascade.
The endocytic process is enhanced and altered in cancer cells,
thus facilitating tumor growth, the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, evasion of apoptosis, and metastasis (28, 45). Rapid
degradation of E-cadherin, aberrant trafﬁcking, and recycling of

integrins are a few of the underlying mechanisms through which
endocytosis promotes oncogenesis and metastasis. Recent evidence indicates that altered endocytosis in cancer cells also
promotes aberrant tyrosine kinase and G-protein–coupled receptor signaling, either by recycling them at a faster rate through the
cell surface or enabling altered receptor signaling from the endosomal compartment (27, 28, 46). Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which the NRP2 axis regulates endocytosis in cancer cells and the effect that the NRP2 axis has on
regulating endocytic trafﬁcking of other tyrosine kinase and
G-protein–coupled receptors, thereby modifying their functions.
Considering that regulation of the endosomal pathway in cancer
cells is an emerging topic in immunotherapy and nanoparticle
delivery, understanding the functional signiﬁcance of the NRP2–
WDFY1 axis is expected to help further therapeutic strategies.
