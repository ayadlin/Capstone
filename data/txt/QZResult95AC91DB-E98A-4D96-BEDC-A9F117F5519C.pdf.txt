BACKGROUND: VEGF signaling pathway inhibitor (anti-VEGF) therapy is associated with hypertension, but little is known about predisposing clinical characteristics. This study describes the real-world association between baseline clinical characteristics, blood pressure (BP) response, and survival in patients prescribed anti-VEGF therapies. METHODS: Clinical data from Partners HealthCare in
Massachusetts was obtained from adults treated with anti-VEGF therapies (2002-2013). Treatment-induced hypertensive response
was defined as worsening of preexisting hypertension or new diagnosis of hypertension (if no prior hypertension history). RESULTS:
Data from 1120 patients with renal cell carcinoma (32.2%), hepatocellular carcinoma (11.6%), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (12.5%),
and other sarcomas (15.3%) were analyzed. Most patients received sunitinib (52%), sorafenib (25.9%), or pazopanib (18%). A
treatment-induced hypertensive response was identified in 49.7% of treated patients. Preexisting hypertension, present in 65.4%, was
an independent risk factor for BP elevation (odds ratio [OR], 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27-1.92); other risk factors included
age 60 years (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06-1.52), and body mass index (BMI) 25 kg/m2 (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53). Race, sex, anti-VEGF
therapy prescribed, and baseline antihypertensive class were not significant risk factors. The absolute observed mean increase in BP
was 21 mm Hg (systolic)/15 mm Hg (diastolic), both in patients with and without preexisting hypertension. The development of hypertension predicted improved survival (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.89). CONCLUSIONS: Preexisting hypertension, age, and BMI
identify patients at risk for significant anti-VEGF therapy-induced BP elevation. Hypertension appears to be a clinical biomarker of efC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling pathway inhibitors (anti-VEGF therapies) play an increasingly important role in the management of solid tumors,1 with approved indications including advanced renal cell carcinoma
(RCC), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), differentiated thyroid cancer, medullary
thyroid cancer, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors.1
Hypertension is a common side effect of anti-VEGF therapies. The reported incidence of all-grade hypertension
ranges from 25% with sorafenib,2 sunitinib,3 and vandetanib4 to 40% with pazopanib5 and axitinib.6 In addition, multiple case reports have described acute hypertensive complications of therapy with anti-VEGF therapies such as malignant
hypertension7 and posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome.8 The mechanism of development of hypertension in
patients taking anti-VEGF therapies remains obscure9 but likely represents on-target effects. This is evidenced by the
higher incidence of hypertension seen with more potent anti-VEGF therapies such as pazopanib and axitinib and by the
finding of a correlation between the occurrence of hypertension and tumor response and survival in secondary analyses of
large clinical studies.10,11 Furthermore, studies have shown that separate genetic polymorphisms in the genes encoding
VEGF-A and its main receptor, VEGFR-2, predispose to either tumor response or the development of hypertension.12
Activation of the VEGF signaling pathway leads to increased production of nitric oxide (NO) and other vasodilators;
some, but not all, studies have shown that blocking this pathway with anti-VEGF therapies reduces serum levels of NO
metabolites.9 Another proposed mechanism includes increased activation of the endothelin-1 system, a potent
vasoconstrictor.9

Original Article

Despite the frequent use of anti-VEGF therapies
and thus the frequent occurrence of treatment-related
hypertension, little has been published on clinical risk factors for the development of hypertension. The goal of the
current analysis was to evaluate preexisting hypertension
and, in an exploratory manner, other clinical characteristics as risk factors for the development of hypertension in
patients receiving anti-VEGF therapies. The second goal
was to evaluate the effect of a treatment-induced hypertensive response on overall survival (OS) and to explore
the effect of baseline antihypertensive treatment on OS in
a cohort of patients treated outside a clinical trial setting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cases were identified using the electronic medical record
(EMR) used by Partners HealthCare, an integrated health
care delivery network in eastern Massachusetts. Case selection criteria were: initiation of any 1 of 6 Food and Drug
Administration–approved anti-VEGF therapies (sunitinib,
sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib, regorafenib, or vandetanib),
no previous anti-VEGF therapy treatment, age >18 years,
receiving care from a clinician at Partners HealthCare, and
at least 1 follow-up visit during anti-VEGF therapy. Cases
were excluded if the anti-VEGF therapy was stopped fewer
than 7 days after initiation or if the subject had any prior exposure to anti-VEGF therapies.
Eligible cases were identified using a search in the
EMR, from which all relevant data were extracted, including the patient’s demographic information, diagnoses,
medications, and vital signs. The patient’s charts were
manually reviewed to confirm the cancer diagnosis and
the initiation date of the anti-VEGF therapies and to
obtain missing data.
The study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Partners HealthCare.
Definition of Outcomes

Our primary aims were to test preexisting hypertension as
a risk factor for the development of a treatment-induced
hypertensive response and whether a treatment-induced
hypertensive response predicts survival. We defined preexisting hypertension based on the presence of at least 1 of
the following criteria at any point prior to the date of initiation of the anti-VEGF therapy: 1) hypertension listed
as a diagnosis in the EMR, 2) at least 1 antihypertensive
medication prescription, and 3) systolic blood pressure
(BP) 160 mm Hg or diastolic BP 100 mm Hg (to
align with version 4.0 of the CTCAE and Joint National
Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and
Treatment of High Blood Pressure [JNC] 7).13,14 The
312

primary outcome was evidence of a treatment-induced hypertensive response (follow-up was until the first antiVEGF therapy was stopped or changed to another antiVEGF therapy). In those without preexisting hypertension, a treatment-induced hypertensive response was
defined as the occurrence of any of the above 3 criteria
during the period that the patient was taking anti-VEGF
therapy. In patients with preexisting hypertension, the
treatment-induced hypertensive response was defined as
having 1 or both of the following criteria while taking
anti-VEGF therapy: 1) dose increase of a prior antihypertensive medication or/and the addition of a new antihypertensive medication, and 2) systolic BP 160 mm Hg
or diastolic BP 100 mm Hg (grade 3 or higher in
CTCAE v4.0).14 Classes of antihypertensive medications
included in the study were beta-blockers, calcium channel
blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), mineralocorticoid antagonists, and diuretics; the loop diuretic furosemide was excluded as it is frequently prescribed for
management of edema. BP response to anti-VEGF therapy was calculated as the difference in the maximal BP
recorded during anti-VEGF therapy and the baseline BP.
Statistical Analysis

Continuous variables were graphically reviewed for normality and transformed if needed. Summary statistics
obtained include mean and standard deviation for continuous normally distributed values; median and 25th/75th
percentiles for nonnormal continuous variables; and number and percentage of population at risk for categorical variables. Age was dichotomized (age above or below 60 years),
as was body mass index (BMI; above or below 25 kg/m2).
To evaluate clinical risk factors for the development
of hypertension, logistic regression was used with the candidate risk factor as a predictor, in univariate analysis and
then in multivariable analysis. Potential confounders that
were included were age, sex, and race, as well as any variable that had a P < .15 on univariate analysis. Odds ratios
(ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are presented.
Sensitivity analyses included comparing those who developed the adverse BP response with those who did not
using t tests for continuous variables and Pearson’s v2 test
or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, modeling
time to development of hypertension using a Cox proportional hazard model and modeling the change in BP in a
linear regression model.
OS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method,
and a log-rank test was used to compare patient groups.
The influence of baseline characteristics on survival was

evaluated using a Cox proportional hazards model. The
onset or worsening of hypertension was considered a timedependent covariate. Each factor was studied in a univariate
model and then included in a multivariable model in which
age, sex, and race were included by default, as well as factors
with a P < .15 in univariate analysis.
As there were 2 primary outcomes, a Bonferronicorrected 2-sided P < .025 was considered statistically significant. For the exploratory outcomes, a 2-sided P < .05
was used, with no adjustment for multiple comparisons.
SAS version 9.3 (SAS, Cary, NC) was used for all
analyses.
RESULTS
Study Population Characteristics

The initial EMR query yielded 1775 potential patients.
After manual review, 655 cases were excluded (Fig. 1),
leaving 1120 participants for analysis. Baseline characteristics are shown in Table 1. The majority of patients were
male (62%) and white (89.5%). The cancer diagnoses
were combined into 5 groups: RCC (32.2%), HCC
(11.6%), GIST (12.5%), non-GIST sarcomas (15.3%),
and other cancers (28.4%); all had unresectable or metastatic disease. Table 2 describes the hypertension characteristics among patients; 65% had baseline hypertension.
Patients with RCC and HCC were more likely to have
baseline hypertension than patients with GIST, sarcomas,
or other cancers (P 5 .0003).
Predictors of Hypertension

As shown in Figure 2, there was a rapid and significant
increase in mean BP following initiation of anti-VEGF

therapy. Table 3 describes the observed changes in BP after anti-VEGF therapy initiation. Mean maximal
increases in BP were 21 and 15 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively, with no significant difference
based on preexisting hypertension status. However, more
patients with preexisting hypertension achieved the primary outcome of an adverse hypertensive response (55%,
vs 40% of patients with no preexisting hypertension). The
median time to first documented development of the
adverse hypertensive response was 29 days. Although BP
medication intensification of only 1 medication was most
common (n 5 161, 14.4%), a substantial proportion of
patients required a dose increase in 2 or more medications
(n 5 77, 6.9%) or the addition of 2 or more new antihypertensive medications (n 5 167, 15.0%). ACEIs/ARBs
(n 5 133, 30.4%) and calcium channel blockers
(n 5 104, 23.7%) were the most commonly used agents.
Of note, 54 patients had a BP 160/100 mm Hg prior to
anti-VEGF therapy initiation; 12 of these had a persistent
BP above 160/100 mm Hg after anti-VEGF therapy initiation and thus were counted as individuals with worsening hypertension. In all but 2 of these patients, there was
an increase in BP with anti-VEGF therapy initiation.
Table 4 shows the results of both unadjusted and
adjusted analyses of potential predictors of the development of the treatment-induced hypertensive response.
The primary adjusted analysis found that preexisting
hypertension (OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.27-1.92) was a risk
factor. In exploratory analyses, age older than 60 years
(OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.06-1.52) and BMI above 25 kg/
m2 (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.04-1.53) were additional independent risk factors. These identify a population at
high risk for the development of treatment-associated
hypertension; Table 5 shows the risk by number of risk
factors, ranging from 31% if no risk factors to 62% in
the presence of all 3 risk factors. Sensitivity analyses (not
shown) were performed using BP greater than 140/
90 mm Hg to define baseline hypertension, the change
in blood pressure while on therapy as the outcome, and
the time to development of a hypertensive response.
These analyses yielded similar results to those presented
here.
Predictors of Overall Survival

Median OS in the overall population was 17.4 months.
There was a survival advantage in patients who developed
hypertension while on anti-VEGF therapy; the unadjusted OS was 25.6 months in those who developed
hypertension versus 11.2 months in those who did not develop hypertension (Table 6; adjusted HR, 0.76; 95% CI,

individuals with cancers other than RCC (n 5 732; HR,

DISCUSSION
Here we describe the burden of hypertension in patients
receiving anti-VEGF therapies for their cancer in a large
real-world data set that includes many types of malignancies; thus, our data should be generally applicable to other
clinical settings. We found that close to 50% of patients
experienced worsening of BP. We also describe risk factors
for the development of a treatment-induced hypertensive
response: preexisting hypertension, age 60 years, and
Cancer

BMI 25 kg/m2. Finally, we show the association
between increasing blood pressure and improved survival.
The rate of treatment-induced hypertensive response
was higher than that observed in other studies.2-6,15 There
are several potential reasons for this. First, the definition
of hypertension has evolved. Earlier studies frequently
reported hypertension based on CTCAE v3.0, which
defined grade 3 hypertension as blood pressure requiring
more than 1 drug or more intensive therapy than

(or stage 2 hypertension) as systolic BP 160 mm Hg or
diastolic BP 100 mm Hg, generally requiring medical
intervention.13,14 Second, prior reports have been largely
based on data from randomized controlled trials in which
patients were required to have controlled BP prior to initiation of therapy and may differ from the population in
whom the medications are used after approval.16 Finally,
awareness of a treatment-induced hypertensive response
to anti-VEGF therapy has increased over time. Hence,
clinicians may be more vigilant in monitoring patients
and be more likely to intensify therapy and follow the
patients closely when BP elevation develops.
In the present analysis, the mean increase in BP from
baseline to the maximal BP reading was 21 and 15 mm Hg
for systolic and diastolic BP, respectively. We, like others,
found that this increase occurred rapidly16-18; as shown in
Figure 2, the difference could be seen within the first 15day period after anti-VEGF therapy initiation. The blood

pressure increased equally in those with and without preexisting hypertension; as the former group had a higher baseline blood pressure, it is not surprising that preexisting
hypertension emerged as a risk factor for the development
of a hypertensive response while on therapy. In view of the
large mean increase in BP, a reasonable approach to avoid
clinically significant hypertension and the resulting acute
complications is to adequately control hypertension to
<140/90 mm Hg before starting anti-VEGF therapy.

Model includes age (continuous), sex, race, BMI (continuous), type of cancer, and type of anti-VEGF therapy.

Our study also identified age and BMI as risk factors; the increase in BP with age was not observed in
prior reports,19 but our study confirms a previous report
that demonstrated an association between adverse BP
response and increasing BMI.19 It is unlikely that differences in drug exposure account for the difference in
risk, as age and weight have only minimal influence on
drug exposure, and anti-VEGF therapy dosages are not
weight based.20 Although the findings persisted after
correcting for potential confounders, it is possible that
our findings represent residual confounding. Although
the reason for the increased risk observed in these
groups remains unclear, the findings remain clinically
relevant: clinicians should be aware of the higher risk of
treatment-induced hypertension in patients with preexisting hypertension as well as in patients with increasing
age and increasing BMI, regardless of baseline hypertension status.
We did not find RCC to be a risk factor for the
treatment-induced hypertensive response, although these

patients did have a higher baseline prevalence of BP. The
same findings have been reported in some2,5 but not
all6,15 studies. The higher rates of baseline hypertension
observed in patients with RCC may be a result of hypertension being a risk factor for RCC21 as well as reflecting
local tumor effects and renal dysfunction after
nephrectomy.22
The OS in our study is consistent with the OS
reported in prior studies.23-25 The predictors of improved
survival that we identified (treatment-induced hypertension, lower age, higher BMI, and RCC/GIST) have been
described in some but not all prior studies. The association
between the development of hypertension and survival in
metastatic RCC has been described previously.10,11 In
terms of advanced age, it was reported to be associated with
reduced survival for RCC,26 but not for GIST in a smaller
study.27 Higher BMI has been described as a protective factor in prior studies in RCC, even after adjusting for stage,
tumor size, and grade.28 A potential explanation is differential expression of the fatty acid synthase gene, shown to be

important in tumor physiology.29 Also, lower BMI may be
a marker of weight loss or cachexia from tumor progression. We did not find a survival advantage with baseline use
of ACEIs or ARBs, as has been found in prior studies.30,31
This may be related to our study having a smaller sample
size than prior studies and hence inadequate power. This is
especially true if the beneficial effect of these antihypertensive agents is restricted to RCC only, as this study only
included 361 such patients.
This study, to our knowledge, is the largest study evaluating risk factors for the development of hypertension in a
variety of cancer patients receiving anti-VEGF therapies. It
is also the largest study looking at survival and hypertension
using “real-world” data, applicable to other clinical settings.
Limitations include the retrospective nature and the electronic capture of data, which may be associated with inaccuracies. An EMR diagnosis of hypertension may be
erroneous, and antihypertensive medications are prescribed
for purposes other than blood pressure control. However,
this would have biased our study toward the null. We also
lacked complete data on prognostic markers, such as performance score, tumor stage and grade, cancer progression,
and prior therapies, and thus could not correct for these.
Nevertheless, the results of our study should encourage clinicians to pay particular attention to BP in the first
month after starting anti-VEGF therapies in high-risk
patients, including patients 60 years old and/or with a
BMI 25 kg/m2. Finally, further studies are needed to
elucidate the mechanism of hypertension with these
agents, which may provide clues to the vascular biology
underlying human hypertension.
