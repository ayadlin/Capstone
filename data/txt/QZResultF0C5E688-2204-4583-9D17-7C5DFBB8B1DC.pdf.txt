ABSTRACT
Overexpression of ATP-Binding Cassette transporters leads to multidrug
resistance in cancer cells and results in the failure of chemotherapy. In this in-vitro
study, we investigated whether or not (20S, 24R/S)-epoxy-12β, 25-dihydroxydommarane-3β-amine (ORA and OSA), a pair of semi-synthetic ocotillol analogue
epimers, could inhibit the ABCB1 transporter. ORA (1 μM and 3 μM) significantly
reversed the resistance to paclitaxel and vincristine in ABCB1-overexpressing SW620/
Ad300 and HEK/ABCB1 cells, whereas OSA had no significant effects. In addition,
ORA (3 μM) significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel
by suppressing the efflux function of ABCB1. Meanwhile, both ORA (3 μM) and OSA
(3 μM) did not significantly alter the expression level or the subcellular location of
ABCB1 protein. Moreover, the ABCB1 ATPase study suggested that ORA had a stronger
stimulatory effect on the ATPase activity than OSA. ORA also exhibited a higher
docking score as compared with OSA inside transmembrane domain of ABCB1. Overall,
we concluded that ORA reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR by competitively inhibiting the
ABCB1 drug efflux function.

BCRP/MXR) [5–7]. Substrates of ABCB1 include
anthracyclines, topoisomerase inhibitors, vinca alkaloids,
and taxanes [8–10]. Therefore, inhibition of ABCB1
gained research focus in order to resensitize MDR
cancer cells to chemotherapeutical agents. Verapamil and
cyclosporin A are classified as first-generation ABCB1
inhibitors [11, 12], while their derivatives such as
PSC-833 are mostly classified as second-generation [13].
The third-generation includes inhibitors such as LY335979,
VX-710, and XR-9576 [14]. However, these compounds
either have severe side effects or alter the pharmacokinetic
profile of anticancer drugs, so their application is impeded
[15, 16]. Therefore, discovery of a novel lead compound
as ABCB1 inhibitor is still urgent and promising for
overcoming MDR in cancer chemotherapy.
Modification of natural active ingredients is one
of the promising methods to identify new inhibitors for

INTRODUCTION
Multi-drug resistance (MDR) is the condition
that enables cancerous cells to resist antineoplastic
compounds with a wide variety of chemical structures
and mechanisms, and therefore is a major cause of
chemotherapy failure [1]. The most prominent factor
for MDR occurring in cancer cells is the increased
efflux of drugs [2, 3]. ATP-binding cassette (ABC)
transporters utilize the energy generated by ATP
hydrolysis to transport various substrates across cellular
membranes, therefore contributing to elevated drugefflux effect in cancer cells [4, 5]. In clinic, the ABC
transporters frequently involved in MDR mainly include
ABC subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1/P-glycoprotein/
MDR1), multi-drug resistance protein 1(ABCC1/
MRP1), and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2/

ABC transporters. Previously, several ginsenosides have
been reported to have reversal effects on MDR cells
[17]. Ginsenoside Rg3 has been observed to compete
with anticancer drugs for binding to ABCB1, thereby
competitively inhibits drug efflux [18]. Derived from
Rg3, 20(S)-protopanaxadiol (aPPD) and its analogues
have also been reported to show reversal nature of
ABCB1 inhibition [19, 20]. Most ginsenosides share a
dammarane-type triterpenoid saponin structure, while
some minor ginsenosides isolated from P. quinquefolius
with a modified steroid skeleton belong to ocotillol-type
triterpenoids, of which the carbon chain at 20-position
is replaced by a tetrahydrofuran ring [21]. To date few
studies have been devoted to the MDR reversal effect
of ocotillol-type triterpenoid derivatives. Therefore, we
designed and tested a series of ocotillol-type analogues
by modifying side chains of aPPD, aiming to acquire
new ABC transporter inhibitors and to better understand
their mechanisms. Our preliminary screening results
(Supplemental Table 1) showed that the two 3-amino
derivatives (20S, 24R/S)-epoxy-12β, 25-dihydroxydommarane-3β-amine (ORA and OSA, Figure 1) had the
most potential MDR reversal activity. Herein, we report
for the first time that ORA and OSA selectively reverse
ABCB1-mediated MDR. The purpose of the present study
was to further demonstrate the MDR reversal activities of
ORA and OSA and elucidate their potential mechanisms.

cells to ORA and OSA. Based on the results from the
MTT assay, we determined that ORA and OSA could be
considered as non-toxic (survival rate higher than 85%)
up to 3 μM against any of the cell lines used in this study
(Figure 2).
Next, we further examined whether ORA and OSA
could increase the sensitivity of ABCB1-expressing drugresistant cells to substrate drugs. As shown in Table 1,
the ABCB1-overexpressing human colon cancer cells
SW620/Ad300 showed much higher IC50 values to
ABCB1 substrates paclitaxel and vincristine than parental
SW620 cells did. Our results showed ORA at both 1 and
3 μM were able to significantly increase the sensitivity
of SW620/Ad300 cells to paclitaxel and vincristine, and
its efficacy showed a concentration-dependent pattern.
OSA was also able to increase the sensitivity of SW620/
Ad300 cells at 3 μM with a weaker efficacy than ORA.
ORA, OSA, and verapamil did not alter the cytotoxicity
of these substrate drugs in parental SW620 cells. The
parental SW620 cells and drug resistant SW620/Ad300
cells exhibited similar sensitivity to cisplatin, which is
not a substrate of ABCB1. The IC50 values of SW620 and
SW620/Ad300 cell lines to cisplatin were also unaffected
by ORA, OSA and verapamil. In the ABCB1-transfected
HEK/ABCB1 and parental HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cell
lines, a similar phenomenon was observed as shown in
Table 2. ORA could significantly inhibit ABCB1-mediated
drug resistance with a concentration-dependent pattern
in HEK/ABCB1. OSA treatment at 3 μM also increased
the sensitivity to ABCB1 substrates in HEK/ABCB1 cell
line; however this reversal result did not yield a significant
difference when compared to the control.
As shown in Table 3, ORA and OSA at 3 μM did not
affect ABCG2- and ABCC1-mediated MDR significantly
when compared with fumitremorgin C (FTC) and PAK104P as positive controls.

RESULTS
ORA and OSA sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs
In order to investigate the effects of ORA and OSA
on ABC transporters, we first examined the sensitivity
of ABCB1-, ABCG2-, and ABCC1-overexpressing

Based on the above results, it appeared that ORA
significantly and selectively inhibited ABCB1-mediated
MDR in both SW620/Ad300 and HEK/ABCB1 cells,
while OSA exhibited reversal effect in SW620/Ad300
cells but not in HEK/ABCB1 cells.

therefore lowering their intracellular concentration [22].
Therefore, in order to further determine the mechanism
of drug accumulation, we performed a time-course efflux
assay using tritium-labeled [3H]-paclitaxel to determine
ABCB1-mediated drug efflux. As shown in Figure 3C–3F,
the intracellular [3H]-paclitaxel in ABCB1-overexpressing
SW620/Ad300 and HEK/ABCB1 cells decreased much
faster over time than those in the parental cells, suggesting
an active process of drug efflux mediated by ABCB1. As
shown in Figure 3C and 3E, ORA, OSA and verapamil
did not significantly influence paclitaxel efflux in parental
SW620 and HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. However, ORA at
3 μM significantly inhibited the efflux function of ABCB1
(Figure 3D and 3F).

ORA increased the accumulation of [3H]paclitaxel in ABCB1-overexpressing cells
To further investigate the potential mechanism by
which ORA and OSA sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing
cells to anticancer drugs, we determined the intracellular
drug accumulation level by radioactive-labeled ABCB1
substrate [3H]-paclitaxel. As shown in Figure 3A and
Figure 3B, intracellular [3H]-paclitaxel levels were
significantly lower in ABCB1-overexpressing SW620/
Ad300 and HEK/ABCB1 cells than those in parental
cells. Verapamil at same concentration in MTT assay
(3 μM) was used as the positive control group. ORA,
OSA and verapamil did not alter the intracellular
paclitaxel accumulation significantly in parental SW620
and HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. ORA at 1 and 3 μM
significantly increased accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel in
ABCB1-overexpressing SW620/Ad300 cells (Figure 3A)
and similar results were observed in transfected HEK/
ABCB1 cells (Figure 3B). These data showed consistent
trend with the MTT assays, and therefore suggested that
ORA sensitized ABCB1-overexpressing cells to anticancer
drugs by increasing their intracellular accumulation.

ORA and OSA had no effects on the expression
of ABCB1 in SW620/Ad300 cells
In order to investigate whether ORA and OSA can
alter the expression pattern of ABCB1, we performed
a western blot assay for ABCB1 in parental SW620
and drug-resistant SW620/Ad300 cells. As shown in
Figure  4A, SW620/Ad300 over-expressed ABCB1
transporter therefore showing a band at about 170 kDa,
whereas parental SW620 cells have no band at same
position. As shown in Figure 4B–4D, the treatment of
ORA and OSA at 3 μM did not significantly change the
expression level of ABCB1 in SW620/Ad300 cells.

ORA inhibited the efflux of [3H]-paclitaxel in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells

ORA and OSA did not alter the
subcellular localization of ABCB1 in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells

ABC transporters were known to mediate multidrug resistance by actively pumping out anti-cancer drugs

demonstrates that the concentration of ORA required to
obtain 50% stimulation is 2.08 μM.

ORA and OSA stimulated ATPase activity
of ABCB1

The existing results have indicated that ORA
and OSA may have direct interactions with ABCB1
transporter. Therefore, we performed a molecular docking
simulation to confirm our hypothesis. ORA and OSA were
more preferable to bind at the transmembrane domain
(TMD) instead of intracellular nuclear binding domain
(NBD) in ABCB1 (Figure 7B). However their binding
poses did not completely overlap, as shown in Figure 7A.
The docked pose of ORA into the large drug-binding
cavity of human ABCB1 is shown in Figure 7C. The
triterpene core of ORA, 20, 24-expoxydammarane was
stabilized into a large cavity formed by hydrophobic residues

ABCB1 transporter utilizes energy derived from
the hydrolysis of ATP to efflux their substrates across the
membrane against a concentration gradient; thus, ATP
consumption reflects its ATPase activity. To assess the
effect of ORA and OSA on the ATPase activity of ABCB1,
we measured ABCB1-mediated ATP hydrolysis in the
presence of ORA or OSA at various concentrations from
0 to 40 μM. Interestingly, ORA stimulated the ATPase
activity of ABCB1 in a concentration-dependent manner,
with a maximal stimulation of 2.46-fold of the basal

paclitaxel and vincristine on parental SW620 cells, which
did not express ABCB1. (iii) ORA did not significantly
change IC50 values of cisplatin, which is not an ABCB1
substrate. Verapamil (3 μM), a known ABCB1 inhibitor,
also exhibited similar effects, however cisplatin did not.
In order to further examine their specificity, we also
determined the effects of ORA and OSA in ABCB1transfected cell lines. Similarly, the results showed the
same trend as those in the drug-selected cell lines and
therefore, supported our hypothesis that ORA suppresses
ABCB1 transporter to reverse MDR. Collectively, the
evidence suggests that ORA can specifically inhibit
ABCB1 function in both drug-selected SW620/Ad300
cells and transfected HEK/ABCB1 cells.
As reported, ABCG2 and ABCC1 transporters also
lead to cancer MDR. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of
ORA and OSA on ABCG2- and ABCC1- overexpressing
MDR cells. As a result of overexpression of ABCG2,
NCI-H460/MX20 were resistant to mitoxantrone as
compared to parental NCI-H460 cells, and the resistance
could be significantly reversed by 3 μM FTC. Our results
reveal OSA and ORA at 3 μM had weak or no effect on
ABCG2 as they failed to alter IC50 values in both parental
and MDR cell lines (Table 2). Likewise, ORA and OSA at
3 μM could not reverse ABCC1-mediated MDR as PAK104P at 10 μM did. Altogether, our major finding is that
ORA would selectively reverse ABCB1-mediated MDR in
a concentration-dependent manner without any effects on
ABCG2- and ABCC1-mediated MDR.
In order to further understand the mechanism of
ORA’s reversal effect, we conducted a radiolabeled drugaccumulation study to evaluate the intracellular level of
[3H]-paclitaxel. Our results showed that MDR cells had
lower levels of intracellular [3H]-paclitaxel accumulation
than parental cells had and, therefore, were less sensitive.
ORA sensitized MDR cells by significantly increasing
the intracellular levels of paclitaxel. We subsequently
performed an efflux assay to determine whether the
accumulation effect was directly associated with inhibition
of the ABCB1 function or due to alternation in uptake of
the drug. Our results showed that ABCB1-mediated drug
efflux was significantly suppressed by ORA, leading to
significant retention of intracellular drug in SW620/Ad300
and HEK/ABCB1 cells.
Previously it has been suggested that suppressed
ABC transporter-mediated efflux could result from protein
down-regulation [24]. However, our Western blot analysis
showed that there was no decrease in ABCB1 protein
level after treatment. Moreover, as we performed Western
blotting using total cell lysates, we further conducted
an immune-fluorescence study in SW620/Ad300
cells to determine the subcellular location of ABCB1.
ABCB1 showed a membrane-like localization pattern in
ABCB1-overexpressing cells [25]. Our results showed that
there are no changes in the subcellular location of ABCB1
after treatment of ORA and OSA as compared to untreated
control. These findings indicated that ORA might directly

DISCUSSION
Natural environment is a fertile ground for discovery
of novel lead compounds for the development of new
drugs. In this study, for the first time we demonstrate that
our natural sourced semi-synthesized compound ORA,
a derivative from 20(S)-protopanaxadiol, significantly
reduced the resistance of MDR cells to ABCB1 substrates,
while its epimer OSA had non-significant effects.
First, we examined the toxic effects of ORA and
OSA alone on all the cell lines we utilized (Figure 2)
and determined their IC15 values (Supplemental Table 2).
Based on these data, the concentrations we used for the
following studies (1 μM and 3 μM) were regarded as noncytotoxic. Therefore, ORA and OSA sensitized the MDR
cells through altering cell function instead of killing cells
together with anti-neoplastic agents.
Originally, ABCB1-overexpressing SW620/Ad300
cells had 1005- and 258-times resistance to paclitaxel and
vincristine respectively as compared to that of parental
SW620 cells. Pre-incubation with 3 μM OSA only
slightly sensitized SW620/Ad300 to substrates, whereas
its 24(R)-epimer ORA at 1 and 3 μM significantly reduced
resistance in the MDR cells in a concentration-dependent
manner (Table 1). This ORA-induced change in resistance
was directly related to ABCB1 as follows: (i) ORA did not
produce any significant toxic effect on either parental or
drug-selected cells. (ii) ORA did not potentiate effects of

these studies provided a great potential for in vivo usage
of ORA. Furthermore, as compared with ligands that are
known to inhibit CYP3A4, ORA and OSA have relatively
lower docking scores. These molecular modelings
predicted ORA and OSA have less potential to have strong
interactions with CYP3A4. Overall, ORA and OSA are
considered as ideal candidates for ABCB1 inhibitor with
potential efficacy in vivo.
In conclusion, this study is the first to demonstrate
that ORA reverses ABCB1-mediated MDR by blocking
pump’s efflux function. These results suggest that ORA
may have the potential to be used in combination with
conventional antineoplastic drugs (ABCB1 substrates) to
augment or resensitize tumor chemotherapy.

inhibit ABCB1 other than down-regulate or translocate
ABCB1 protein.
As previously reported, the model of substrate
transport by ABCB1 can be summarized in two stages.
Firstly, the substrate enters into the internal drug-binding
pocket through an open portal. Secondly, ATP-binding
at the NBDs causes a large conformational change,
presenting the substrate and the drug-binding sites to
the outer leaflet [9]. In that case, an ATP modulator
could either bind to drug-binding pocket in TMD as a
competitive inhibitor, or block ATP-binding in NBDs as
a non-competitive inhibitor. It was interesting that ORA
and OSA had different inhibitory efficacy as a pair of
enantiomer. It can be concluded from out results that ORA
had stronger effect on the ATPase activity of ABCB1 than
OSA, by behaving as typical substrate and binding at the
drug-substrate-binding site of ABCB1 transporter.
The molecular docking study further supports the
results which indicate that ORA and OSA had direct
interactions with ABCB1. Glide gscore is an empirical
scoring function that approximates the ligand binding free
energy [26]. The Glide gscores of both ORA and OSA at
NBDs (ATP-binding sites) were much lower than those
at TMDs as shown in Figure 7B. Therefore, ORA or
OSA may not likely block ATP binding at NBDs, which
is also supported by our ATPase results. An underlying
correlation between ABCB1 inhibitory activity and
lipophilicity of the compounds has already been suggested
[27]. Hydrophobic compounds may distribute more into
biomembrane from which ABCB1 extracts the substrates
as previously illustrated [9]. ORA and OSA also exhibit
the some pharmacophoric features such as hydrophobic
groups, hydrogen bond acceptors, and positively charged
ionizable group that have been described as critical for
ABCB1 inhibition [28, 29]. However, although ORA and
OSA shared these features, the gscores expressed in kcal/
mol for ORA and OSA were found to be (-8.031) and
(-6.175) respectively. Weaker reversal effect of OSA could
partially be explained by its poor binding energy score [29].
Moreover, OSA had a fewer contact counts in docking study
when compared to that of ORA at their best docking pose
respectively, which may also indicate its weaker interaction
with ABCB1. Collectively, our docking results indicated the
importance of 24R-conformer of 20, 24-epoxy-dammarane
derivatives in ABCB1 inhibition and provided clues in
molecular level for further optimization.
The safety of herb components is ensured by the
continuous and long history of usage in large amounts
as part of normal daily diet [30]. ORA and OSA are
semi-synthetic derivatives of ocotillol-type triterpenoid
obtained from ginseng. Previously, Li et al identified
the formation of 20.24-epoxy-dammarane derivatives as
main metabolite of aPPD in human liver microsomes and
human hepatocytes [31]. Furthermore, an in vivo study
described that ocotillol at 10 mg/kg did not have any toxic
effects on nude mice in a period of 24 days [32]. Hence,

suspended in the medium. Cells were then pre-incubated
with PBS, ORA (1 μM and 3 μM, respectively), OSA
(3 μM), or verapamil (3 μM) at 37°C for 1 h. Subsequently,
cells were suspended in the medium containing 0.1 μM
[3H]-paclitaxel for 2 h in the presence or absence of the
reversal compounds at 37°C. After washing three times
with ice cold PBS, the cells were lysed by adding lysis
buffer (pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2%
SDS). Each sample was placed in 5 ml scintillation fluid
and radioactivity was measured in the Packard TRICARB 1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer from Packard
Instrument Company, Inc (Downers Grove, IL).

Cell lines and cell culture
HEK293/pcDNA3.1, HEK/ABCB1 and HEK/
ABCC1 cells were established by transfecting HEK293
with either the empty pcDNA3.1 or vector containing
the full length ABCB1 (HEK/ABCB1) or ABCC1 (HEK/
ABCC1), and were cultured in a medium containing
2 mg/ml of G418 [34]. The human colon cancer cell
line SW620  and its doxorubicin-selected ABCB1overexpressing SW620/Ad300 cell line were used for
reversal study. Non-small cell lung cancer NCI-H460
cells and mitoxantrone-selected ABCG2-overexpressing
NCI-H460/MX20 cells were kindly provided by Drs.
Susan Bates and Robert Robey (NCI, NIH, Bethesda,
MD). All the cell lines were grown as adherent monolayers
in flasks with DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified
incubator containing of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

[3H]-paclitaxel efflux assay
To measure the drug efflux, the cells were pretreated
for 1 h with PBS, ORA at 1 μM and 3 μM, OSA at
3 μM, or verapamil at 3 μM. Radioactive substrate [3H]paclitaxel was then added, and cells were further incubated
for 2 h at 37°C. Cells were washed three times with icecold PBS, and then were supplemented with fresh medium
with or without inhibitors. After 0, 30, 60 and 120 min,
the aliquots of cells were removed and washed with icecold PBS immediately. Radioactivity was then measured
as previously described [36].

Cell cytotoxicity by MTT assay

Preparation of total cell lysates

The MTT colorimetric assay was used to detect
the sensitivity of the cells against anticancer drugs.
Cells (5 × 103/well) were seeded evenly into (160 μl/
well) 96-well plates and cultured overnight. For the
reversal experiments, ORA, OSA, and parallel control
modulators (20 μl/well) were added 1 h prior. Different
concentrations of the chemotherapeutic drugs (20 μl/well)
were then added into the designated wells. After 72 h of
incubation, 20 μl of MTT solution (4 mg/ml) was added
to each well, and the plate was further incubated for
4 h. Subsequently, the medium was discarded, and 100 μl
of dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) was added into each well
to dissolve the formazan crystals. The absorbance was
determined at 570 nm by the OPSYS microplate reader
(DYNEX Technology, Inc., Chantilly, VA). The IC50 value
was calculated from the survival curves using the modified
Bliss method [35]. Verapamil was used at a nontoxic
concentration of 3 μM as a positive control for ABCB1
overexpressing cell lines. FTC at 3 μM and PAK-104P
at 10 μM were used as positive control for ABCG2 and
ABCC1 overexpressing cell lines, respectively.

Cell extracts were prepared by incubating with lysis
buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS,
150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 and 0.01% leupeptin)
for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 12, 000 × g
at 4°C for 20 min. The supernatant containing total cell
lysates was stored at -80°C until gel electrophoresis was
performed. Protein concentrations were determined by
bicinchoninic acid (BCA™) based protein assay (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL).

Western blotting analysis
Equal amounts of total cell lysate (20 μg protein)
were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes. The membranes were blocked and then
immunoblotted with primary monoclonal antibodies
against either actin at 1:400 dilution or ABCB1 at 1:100
dilution at room temperature for 2 h. They were further
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish
peroxide (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000
dilution). The protein-antibody complex was detected
by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system
(Amersham, NJ) as previously described [37]. The protein
expression was quantified by ImageJ software (NIH,
Bethesda, MD, USA).

[3H]-paclitaxel accumulation assay
The accumulation of [3H]-paclitaxel in HEK293/
pcDNA3.1, HEK/ABCB1, SW620 and SW620/Ad300
cells was measured in the presence or absence of
inhibitors. Cells were typsinized after they reached 80%
confluence, then five aliquots from each cell line were

computations were carried out on a Dell Precision 490n
dual processor with Linux OS (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

The vanadate (Vi)-sensitive ATPase activity of
ABCB1 in the membrane vesicles of High Five insect
cells was measured as described previously [38]. The
membrane vehicles were incubated in the ATPase assay
buffer with or without vanadate, in different concentrations
of ORA and OSA, and then in Mg-ATP in chronological
order followed previously described protocols [39].
The reactions were stopped after 20 minutes and the
liberated inorganic phosphate was measured as previously
described [39].

Molecular modeling

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

ORA, OSA, paclitaxel, biricodar were built and
prepared as ligands by our previous molecular modeling
protocols [40]. The output files containing at most
100 unique conformers were used as input for docking
simulations into human ABCB1 or human CYP3A4.
The human ABCB1 homology model based on refined
mouse ABCB1 was kindly provided by S. Aller and was
used to generate docking grid [41]. Crystal structure
of human CYP3A4 (PDB ID: 4K9W) was used for
protein preparation. Protein Preparation Wizard (Epik
version 2.5; Impact version 6.0, Schrödinger, LLC, New
York, NY, 2013) default protocol was followed for protein
refinement, in which the protonation states of residues
were adjusted to the dominant ionic forms at physiological
pH [42]. ABCB1 docking grid was generated by selecting
all conserved drug interacting residues as centroid [41].
CYP3A4 grid was generated by selecting co-crystalized
ligand. The co-crystalized ligand, a desoxyritonavir
analog, was also prepared and redocked into CYP3A4.
Then the grids were refined as enclosing boxes with length
no more than 25 Å by Glide version 6.0 (Schrödinger,
LLC, New York, NY, 2013).
Docking simulations were performed using the
“Extra Precision” (XP) mode of Glide version 6.0
(Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2013). The value of
Glide Emodel was ranked to determine the best docked
pose for multiple conformations [26]. The XP Glide
