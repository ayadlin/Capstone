Abstract
The function of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in DNA repair could affect
the sensitivity of cells to cytotoxic agents, and would therefore
be an important component of planning therapy for breast
and ovarian cancers. Previously, both BRCA1- and BRCA2deficient tumors were shown to be sensitive to mitomycin C,
and the mechanism was presumed to be a defect in the repair
of interstrand crosslinks by homologous recombination. Here,
we show that both BRCA1 and BRCA2 determine the
sensitivity to the cytotoxic drug, etoposide, using genetic
complementation of BRCA-deficient cells. Etoposide is known
to bind to topoisomerase II and prevent the resolution of the
‘‘cleavable complex,’’ in which one DNA duplex is passed
through a second duplex. The specificity of this BRCAdependent sensitivity was confirmed by the use of aclarubicin,
which is a catalytic inhibitor of topoisomerase II and prevents
the formation of the cleavable complex. In the presence of
aclarubicin, the differential sensitivity of BRCA-proficient and
BRCA-deficient cells was lost. Thus, etoposide requires the
presence of topoisomerase II to show specific sensitization in
the absence of the function of BRCA1 or BRCA2. We conclude
that homologous recombination is used in the repair of DNA
damage caused by topoisomerase II poisons. Overall, these
results suggest that etoposide is a potentially useful drug in
the treatment of BRCA-deficient human cancers. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of
families with hereditary susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer
(1). Although carriers of the BRCA gene mutations are heterozygous (one normal copy and one mutated copy) within the germ
line, tumorigenesis in individuals with germ line BRCA mutations
requires the inactivation of the remaining wild-type allele.
One important role of the BRCA proteins is in the promotion of
DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair via homologous recombination (2). Loss of BRCA function results in a marked sensitivity to
DNA crosslinking agents, such as mitomycin C (3). The reason for
this phenotype is thought to be the requirement of homologous
recombination for the repair of the interstrand crosslinks. A
genetically engineered deficiency in either BRCA1 or BRCA2 results
in early embryonic lethality in mice (4, 5). Cells derived from these
knockout mice show increased spontaneous chromosomal aberra-

tions and the impaired formation of Rad51 nuclear foci caused by
DNA damage (2, 5, 6). Although BRCA1-deficient cells have a more
complex phenotype, including transcriptional and cell cycle
checkpoint defects, both BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells
showed increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation, bleomycin,
mitomycin C, and cisplatinum (3, 7).
Etoposide, an epipodophyllotoxin, is a widely used antitumor
agent which acts by the inhibition of topoisomerase II, an enzyme
that facilitates the separation of intertwined DNA duplex molecules
that arise following DNA replication. Topoisomerase II introduces a
transient DSB in one of the DNA duplexes, followed by passing the
unbroken DNA duplex through the transient DSB. The enzyme
then religates the DNA break and releases both DNA molecules.
Etoposide prevents this religation step by covalently binding
to topoisomerase II and creating a ‘‘frozen cleavable complex’’
(a stable drug–enzyme–DNA complex; ref. 8). The role of etoposide
as a specific topoisomerase II ‘‘poison’’ was further established by
showing that its activity was downstream of a step controlled by
aclarubicin, a topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor. Aclarubicin
inhibits topoisomerase II before it is able to catalyze the
production of these specialized DSBs. Pretreatment with aclarubicin has been previously shown to decrease etoposide-induced
DSBs and its resultant cytotoxicity (9).
Here, we provide evidence that BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient
cells are more sensitive to the antineoplastic agent etoposide than
their genetically complemented isogenic partner cell. Furthermore,
we show that pretreatment of cells with aclarubicin (aclacinomycin
A), eliminated the difference between BRCA-deficient and BRCAproficient cells, proving that the observed etoposide sensitivity was
due to the induction of the specialized DNA DSBs that arise by the
action of the drug on the enzyme topoisomerase II (10). The
marked sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cancer cells to specific
cytotoxic agents may have important implications for the optimum
systemic therapy of breast and ovarian tumors in the clinic.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and genetic complementation. HCC1937 cells, derived from
a tumor arising in a patient with early onset breast cancer and a germ line
mutation in the BRCA1 gene, were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection. The tumor cells have a COOH-terminal truncating mutation (the
germ line mutation) and loss of the second BRCA1 allele (11). Stable
transfection of wild-type BRCA1 was achieved using an expression plasmid
containing a full-length human BRCA1 cDNA inserted into the pcDNA3.1neo
vector, using LipofectAMINE Plus (Life Technology) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were grown as described previously (12).
BRCA2-deficient EUFA423 immortalized fibroblasts, with biallelic
truncations of the COOH-terminal region of both BRCA2 genes (13), were
provided by Alan D’Andrea (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA).
Restoration of BRCA2 wild-type status was achieved by stable transfection
of an expression plasmid containing a full-length human BRCA2 cDNA

insert in the pcDNA3.1neo vector, again using LipofectAMINE Plus and
selected for expression with 500 Ag/mL of geneticin (G418, Sigma).
The expression of BRCA1 protein in the complemented HCC1937 cells is
shown in Fig. 1A; the expression of BRCA2 protein in the complemented
EUFA423 cells is shown in Fig. 1B. Both of these cell pairs have been used in
previous studies (12, 13).
Drug treatments. Etoposide (Sigma) was diluted to experimental
concentrations from a 25 mmol/L stock in DMSO. Aclarubicin (Sigma)
was prepared for the experiments using a 200 Amol/L solution in PBS and
0.32% ethanol, according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. Etoposide was
applied to cells at concentrations up to 30 Amol/L (f17.6 Ag/mL) for
1 h and then rinsed thrice in PBS. The cells were then collected by
trypsinization, resuspended in ice-cold medium, and plated in 25 cm2 flasks
for clonogenic survival assays. Aclarubicin was applied to cells at
concentrations up to 1 Amol/L for 30 min, with or without a subsequent
exposure to etoposide for 1 h.
Colony-forming assay of cell survival. Cell killing was measured by
clonogenic survival. Cells were harvested from tissue culture flasks using
trypsin at 37jC, made into a single cell suspension and were plated in
triplicate into T25 flasks at various cell densities, with a target number of
surviving colonies at 50 to 100 per flask. Treatment with etoposide was
carried out 14 to 18 h after cell plating. After a 1-h exposure to the drug,
cells were rinsed thrice with PBS, and then regular medium was added.
After 8 to 10 days for EUFA423 cells, or 17 to 20 days for HCC1937 cells,
methanol fixation and staining with 0.35% methylene blue was undertaken
to identify visible colonies (z50 cells). The surviving fractions were
calculated as the plating efficiency of treated cells relative to the plating
efficiency of untreated control cells.
For the experiments with aclarubicin, cells were plated into T25 flasks
and, after 14 to 18 h, they were exposed to the drug for 30 min. Aclarubicin
was removed by three rinses using PBS. Depending on the experiment, the
cells were then treated with etoposide (as described above) or used directly
in the colony survival assay. To correct for the additive toxic effect of both
drugs, the surviving fractions following etoposide treatment were calculated
relative to the surviving fractions of cells treated with aclarubicin only.
All survival experiments were done in triplicate; therefore, each datapoint
represents the mean of three experiments, with error bars in the graphs
depicting the SE.

Results
BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells show increased sensitivity to etoposide. HCC1937 cells (BRCA1-deficient) showed
increased cell sensitivity compared with the HCC1937 cells
transfected with wild-type BRCA1. The effect was observed for all
doses of etoposide tested (see Fig. 2A), reaching a maximum when
the etoposide concentration was 30 Amol/L. The doses used in this
study were within the expected range to be achieved when patients
are treated with conventional doses of etoposide in the clinic. For
example, 4.7 Ag/mL is the average plasma level after 100 mg of i.v.
etoposide, which is equal to f8 Amol/L, based on the etoposide
data sheet. BRCA1-deficient cells showed a surviving fraction
3.24-fold smaller than that observed with the BRCA1-complemented
cells.
A similar result was observed for the BRCA2-deficient cells,
EUFA423. These fibroblasts revealed a greater sensitivity to
etoposide than the cells transfected with wild-type BRCA2. The
effect was apparent with doses as low as 0.8 Amol/L and reached a
2.75-fold difference at 10 Amol/L (see Fig. 2B).
BRCA-deficient cells are equally sensitive to aclarubicin. The
survival of the same cell line pairs to a topoisomerase II
inhibitor was assessed by exposing the cells to aclarubicin at
doses of 0.5 and 1 Amol/L. Aclarubicin inhibits the topoisomerase II enzyme, and prevents the formation of the
cleavable complex, which occurs after the enzymatic process of
topoisomerase II is completed. The purpose of these experiments
was to determine whether the sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells
was dependent on the formation of the cleavable complex DSB.
The survival curves (shown in Fig. 3A and B) reveal that, within
the range of doses used in these experiments, the toxic effect of
aclarubicin was mild and was unaffected by the BRCA status of
the cell. Even at the 1-Amol/L concentration, the cell-killing
induced by the topoisomerase II catalytic inhibitor was limited
to f30% (70% survival). By comparison, cell-killing induced by
the topoisomerase II poisons, such as etoposide, was <1%, which
implies that lethality from etoposide is a consequence of forming
the complex DNA DSB.
Pretreatment with aclarubicin abrogates the differential
sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to etoposide. Survival assays
after treatment with etoposide were repeated by first treating the
cells with increasing doses of aclarubicin for 30 min. With
increasing doses of aclarubicin, the survival of all cell lines
increased, but the differential sensitivity of the BRCA-deficient cells
was eliminated. For the BRCA1 cell pair, using 25 Amol/L of
etoposide, which had resulted in 8% and 22% survival for the
BRCA1-deficient and complemented cells, respectively, a concentration of 1 Amol/L of aclarubicin increased the surviving fraction
of both cell lines to 35% (Fig. 4A). Thus, the differential sensitivity
of the BRCA1-deficient cell is caused by the action of etoposide in
producing topoisomerase II–dependent DNA lesions.
Similarly, for the BRCA2 cell pair, increasing pretreatment
doses of aclarubicin decreased the sensitivity of both cell lines to
etoposide and, at 1 Amol/L of aclarubicin, the surviving fractions
became similar, independent of the BRCA2 status (Fig. 4B).
This cell pair is noted to be more sensitive to etoposide, and
10 Amol/L produces 1% and 3% cell survival for the BRCA2deficient and BRCA2-complemented cells, respectively. After
aclarubicin treatment, the survival of both lines increased to
7%. The implication, again, is that the sensitivity of BRCA2deficient cells to etoposide was due to the formation of complex
double-stranded lesions.

Discussion
We have shown that BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells exhibited
increased sensitivity to etoposide compared with isogenic cells in
which the deficiency had been corrected. The use of isogenic cell
pairs in these experiments is crucial because many other unknown
factors could contribute to the differential sensitivity found with
these drugs in nonisogenic systems. The same observation for the
effect of both BRCA1 and BRCA2 deficiency provides further
support to the idea that it is the DNA repair pathways regulated by
these proteins which accounts for many of the common features of
genomic instability found in familial breast and ovarian cancer.
Whereas sensitivity to mitomycin C and cisplatinum has been
reported for BRCA1- or BRCA2-deficient cells (3, 14, 15), sensitivity
to etoposide was not necessarily an expected observation. The
phenotype of cells deficient in homologous recombination is to
show marked sensitivity to interstrand crosslinking agents, and
mild sensitivity to agents producing DSBs, such as ionizing
radiation and bleomycin. In this context, etoposide produces DSBs
via topoisomerase II. However, the DSBs produced by etoposide are
S and G2 phase–specific. Thus, it was a reasonable hypothesis to
think that the combination of a functional DSB occurring in the

context of the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle might reveal the
repair deficiency of homologous recombination found in BRCA1and BRCA2-deficient cells. The experiments reported here have
conclusively shown that the etoposide sensitivity of BRCA1- and
BRCA2-deficient cells was due to the formation of the cleavable
complex because aclarubicin abrogates the effect of etoposide, and
eliminates the differential sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells.
Previous studies (16, 17) reported decreased growth of cells
containing a BRCA1 mutation after 3 days of continuous exposure
to etoposide. Our results, in line with these studies, were obtained
using a colony formation assay as the preferred readout for
cytotoxicity, excluding an effect of cell cycle arrest. Increased
etoposide sensitivity of the BRCA2-deficient Capan-1 human
pancreatic cancer cell line has been reported (18). However, the
authors compared its sensitivity to three other human cancer cell
lines and with wild-type BRCA2 from different origins, which
makes it difficult to exclude the effects of other nonspecific factors.
Results with the EUFA423-BRCA2 isogenic cell pair in this study
make this observation more secure. In addition, the injection of
Capan-1 cells into immunodeficient mice resulted in smaller
tumors following etoposide treatment compared with the tumors

resulting from the injection of a different pancreatic cancer cell
line expressing wild-type BRCA2, suggesting that the observation
can be reproduced in a tumor model (19).
The experiments using aclarubicin are important to emphasize
the significance of the results presented in this report. The toxicity
of aclarubicin in the doses used was mild and independent of
BRCA function. Thus, any concern about the complex interactive
effects of aclarubicin and etoposide seems unlikely because the
toxic effects were dominated by etoposide. The differential
sensitivity of BRCA-deficient cells to etoposide was due to the
component of etoposide toxicity which operates through topoisomerase II. The combination of experiments shown in this
report has clearly shown that topoisomerase II–mediated doublestrand damage has a particular sensitivity to tumor cells lacking
the function of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 proteins. Whether this is due
to the production of DSBs at phases in the cell cycle when BRCA1/
BRCA2-mediated repair was prominent, or due to other more
specific interactions between BRCA1 or BRCA2 and topoisomerase
II, is not yet clear (20). Given the recent report showing the
interaction of BRCA1 and topoisomerase IIa and the effect of

BRCA1 on topoisomerase II activity, some of the sensitivity of the
BRCA1-deficient cells could be due to a direct effect on topoisomerase II. Whatever the detailed mechanism, these results have
suggested that drugs such as etoposide can be specifically useful in
tumors with BRCA1/BRCA2 inactivations.
In summary, our results show that the increased sensitivity of
BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient cells to etoposide was due to the
specific DSB created by topoisomerase II. These findings are in line
with an increasing body of evidence supporting the notion that
BRCA deficiency renders proliferating cells more sensitive to a
specific type of DSB. The ability to determine whether or not the
BRCA1/BRCA2-dependent pathway of DNA repair was functional
would be valuable information, as it could determine the choice of
therapy in the patient.
