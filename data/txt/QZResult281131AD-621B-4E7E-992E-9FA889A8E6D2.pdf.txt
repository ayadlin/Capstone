Abstract

Author Manuscript

Resistance to therapies targeting the estrogen pathway remains a challenge in the treatment of
estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer. To address this challenge, a systems biology approach
was used. A library of siRNAs targeting an estrogen receptor- and aromatase-centered network
identified 46 genes that are dispensable in estrogen-dependent MCF7 cells, but are selectively
required for the survival of estrogen-independent MCF7-derived cells, and multiple additional
estrogen-independent breast cancer cell lines. Integration of this information identified a tumor
suppressor gene TOB1 as a critical determinant of estrogen-independent estrogen receptor-positive
breast cell survival. Depletion of TOB1 selectively promoted G1 phase arrest and sensitivity to
AKT and mTOR inhibitors in estrogen-independent cells but not estrogen-dependent cells.
Phosphoproteomic profiles from reverse phase protein array analysis supported by mRNA
profiling identified a significant signaling network reprogramming by TOB1 that differed in
estrogen-sensitive and estrogen-resistant cell lines. These data support a novel function for TOB1
in mediating survival of estrogen-independent breast cancers. These studies also provide evidence
for combining TOB1 inhibition and AKT/mTOR inhibition as a therapeutic strategy, with potential
translational significance for the management of patients with estrogen receptor-positive breast
cancers.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in the United States and is the
second leading cause of cancer related deaths in this population [1]. Approximately 70% of
newly diagnosed breast cancers express high levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) [2], a
nuclear transcription factor that controls cell proliferation, in large part by regulating gene
expression. ERα also has been described as having additional functions, including the
regulation of growth factor signaling [3]. Anti-estrogens (AEs) and aromatase inhibitors [4]
[4] are currently used to treat ER-positive breast cancer in pre-menopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively. AIs such as exemestane or anastrozole block the
biosynthesis of the ERα ligand estrogen, while AEs such as tamoxifen or fulvestrant
compete with estrogen for binding to ERα, in each case resulting in diminished ERα activity
and in some cases diminished nuclear localization, leading to impaired cell proliferation and
survival.

Author Manuscript

De novo and acquired drug resistance to AEs and AIs pose significant challenges to the
effective treatment of ERα positive breast cancers. Numerous resistance mechanisms have
been identified, including epigenetic changes affecting the ERα promoter [5], mutations
activating the ERα protein to ligand independence [6, 7], altered expression or activation of
cellular signaling proteins that generally promote survival such as epithelial growth factor
receptor (EGFR) [8], insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGFR) [9], PI3K/AKT [10], mTOR
signaling [11] and NFκB [12], and altered expression of specific miRNAs [13]. However, in
hormone therapy-resistant breast cancer, chemotherapy remains the primary treatment
modality [14], and the prognosis of such patients is poor.

Author Manuscript

To address this problem, we aimed to identify new points of vulnerability in estrogenindependent, AE/AI-resistant breast cancers. A number of studies have demonstrated that
changes in the proximal signaling networks to proteins targeted by drugs are particularly
common sources of resistance to the targeting agent [15-17]. The goal of this study was to
use in silico resources to develop a network centered on ERα and related estrogen receptors
and aromatase, and then to create and probe a siRNA library individually targeting genes in
this network, to better understand the key mechanisms of estrogen independence and
antiestrogen resistance. Interrogation of the functional signaling consequences of this gene
targeting was performed using quantitative highly multiplexed protein pathway activation
mapping. These studies identified a group of genes with action specifically required for the
survival of estrogen-independent cells. Strikingly, this work also demonstrated selective
action of the tumor suppressor TOB1 (transducer of c-erbB2) as important for basal growth
and drug resistance of estrogen-independent cell lines, based on distinctive regulation of
survival and cell cycle signaling in these cell lines. These observations have potential
translational significance for the management of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers.

RESULTS
Estrogen Response- Centered Network

Author Manuscript

We hypothesized that loss of estrogen dependence would reflect an altered cellular
requirement for genes closely linked to core genes regulating estrogen response. A 631protein estrogen response network (ERN) was developed around 5 seed proteins relevant to
estrogen signaling: the estrogen receptor genes ESR1 (ERα) and ESR2 (ERβ), the estrogenrelated receptors ESRRA and ESRRG, and CYP19A1 (aromatase) (Figure 1A, Table S1).
For network construction, data for each of the 5 seeds was initially collected from public
archives reporting protein-protein interactions (PPIs), association in protein complexes,
curated pathway information, and estrogen-responsive genes. PPI databases (BIND [18],
BioGRID [19], DIP [20], HPRD [21], IntAct [22], and MINT [23]) were mined for first and
second neighbors of the 5 seed proteins both directly and via metasearch engines such as
MiMI [24] and STRING [25].
Two hundred and forty-eight “first neighbors”, defined as proteins that directly interacted
with a seed protein based on experimental data, constituted a high confidence core. 12
proteins reported in the literature [26, 27] as complexed with ESR1, ESR2 or ESRRA were
also included in the ER-centered network as a high confidence core. We used multiple
databases reporting ER signaling interactions to identify 44 proteins as a pathway core. The
Estrogen Responsive Gene Database (ERGD) [28] listed 38 high confidence genes reported
as manifesting altered transcriptional responses to an estrogen stimulus. Beyond these high
confidence cores, which in sum contributed 308 genes to the ERN, 323 additional genes
were included based on their occurrence in at least two lower confidence sets (Figure 1A).

Screening the ERN library identifies genes specifically required for viability in estrogenindependent cell lines

Author Manuscript

To compare the cellular requirement for genes in the ERN in the context of decreased
estrogen dependence and increased anti-estrogen resistance, we used a siRNA library
targeting the 631 genes in the ERN to screen four cell lines: MCF7, LCC1, LCC9, and HFF
(Table S2). MCF7 is an estrogen-dependent breast adenocarcinoma cell line and sensitive to
treatment with the AEs tamoxifen and fulvestrant. The MCF7-derived cell line LCC1 was
selected in vivo for estrogen-independence, which commonly reflects AI resistance, but
remains sensitive to tamoxifen and fulvestrant. LCC9, further derived by selection from
LCC1 cells, is resistant to both tamoxifen and fulvestrant [29, 30]. Human foreskin
fibroblasts (HFF) do not depend on estrogen signaling, and provided a control for nonspecific inhibitors of cell viability. Analysis of primary hits indicated that LCC1 and LCC9
were significantly more susceptible to loss of viability following depletion of ERN genes
than were MCF7 or HFF cells. Use of a biological cut-off of 50% viability or less identified
190 candidate hits for the LCC1 cells, 117 for LCC9 cells, 9 for MCF7 cells and 1 for HFF1
cells (Figure S1, A-B).
Validation of hits obtained in LCC1 or LCC9 cells was performed using transfection of
multiple siRNAs and confirmation of gene depletion by quantitative reverse transcriptasepolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (Figure S1, C-D). Following validation, 85 genes

were confirmed as important for viability in LCC1 cells, 65 in LCC9 cells, and 3 in MCF7
cells; of these, 49 were common to LCC1 and LCC9, which included the 3 in MCF7 cells
(Figure 1C, Table S1 and S3). Focusing on the genes required in LCC1 and/or LCC9, we
assessed if these genes selectively derived from specific categories of input to the ERN. This
analysis indicated that this set was enriched for siRNAs targeting genes that either interacted
directly with the 5 ERN seeds, or included estrogen-responsive genes (Figure 1B).

Author Manuscript

A subset of the 49 genes specifically required in LCC1 and LCC9 cells have previously been
implicated as influencing viability in breast cancer or untransformed mammary cells (Figure
1D, see references in legend; Table S3). A limited number of these genes have also been
identified as contributing to cell proliferation and survival in additional cell types,
suggesting they may be similarly important in breast cancers (Figure 1D). Finally, gene
ontology assignment [31, 32] suggested that the set of ERN genes specifically required in
LCC1 and LCC9 cells was enriched in genes annotated for roles associated with RNA
polymerase, the proteasome, and mRNA splicing (Figure 1D).
Estrogen-independent pro-survival (EIPS) genes are selectively required for survival in
multiple estrogen-independent cell lines

Author Manuscript

We selected 25 genes from the LCC1/LCC9 viability group for more in depth analysis
(Table S3) and defined them as estrogen-independent pro-survival (EIPS) genes. To
determine whether their roles in viability were specific to cells of the MCF7 lineage, or more
generally reflected a requirement in estrogen-independent versus estrogen-dependent cell
lines, we analyzed the consequences of depletion in five additional breast cancer cell lines:
MDA-MB-231 (triple negative, estrogen-independent), T47D (ERα-positive, estrogendependent, and tamoxifen/fulvestrant-sensitive), T47D-co (ERα-positive, estrogenindependent, and tamoxifen/fulvestrant-resistant), BT-474 (ERα-positive, estrogendependent), and MCF10A (similar to normal mammary epithelial cells) (Figure 1E).
Strikingly, this analysis indicated that the group of 5 estrogen-independent breast cancer cell
lines MDA-MB231, LCC1, LCC9, T47D-co, and T47D clustered together in requiring EIPS
genes for viability, in contrast to the estrogen-dependent cell lines MCF10A, MCF7, and
BT474, in which the EIPS genes were generally less necessary for cell survival.

Author Manuscript

Knockdown of genes in the EIPS set might reduce cell viability by increasing apoptosis,
decreasing cell proliferation, or both. Genes required for apoptosis resistance would be of
particular interest as potential targets in cancer therapy, in contrast to those that primarily
induce cytostasis. Activity levels of caspase 3/7 were assessed as surrogates for apoptotic
induction following depletion of each of the EIPS genes. Knockdown of 15 genes in the
group increased caspase 3/7 activities at least 2-fold in LCC1 cells, with 16 genes having
such activity in LCC9 cells (Figure 1F). In general, the degree of apoptotic induction
associated with each gene in the set was comparable in the two lines, with knockdown of the
transcription factor CNOT1, the polymerase II subunits POLR2B and POLR2C, and the
proteasome component PSMB4 having the most significant effects. Finally, while LCC1 and
LCC9 grow in estrogen-independent fashion, they retain ERα and other estrogen receptors,
which may retain some biological activities. Potentially, the availability of estrogen might
regulate the cell survival effect of genes in the EIPS set. However, no significant difference

in viability was observed in knocking down these genes in LCC9 cells grown in the presence
or absence of 1 nM estradiol, and only minimal differences were observed for a small
number of genes in LCC1 cells (Figure S2).

Author Manuscript

Among the set of EIPS genes, we noted that TOB1 has been previously described as a
transducer of ERBB2 signaling, is upregulated by ERBB2, and is linked to poor prognosis in
node-negative breast cancer [33]. These features have considerable relevance to estrogen
resistance. Further, by comparing steady state mRNA expression of 45 genes active in LCC1
and/or LCC9 in 9 estrogen-dependent and 8 estrogen-independent breast cancer cell lines
(Table S4 for cell line information), TOB1 was one of the top 2 genes in which mRNA
expression differed most significantly in estrogen-independent versus estrogen-dependent
breast cancer cell lines (Figure 2A), being higher in estrogen-dependent cell lines.
Additionally, TOB1 was amplified and/or overexpressed in 14% of 979 invasive breast
cancers assembled in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (Figure 2B and Figure S3, A). In
analysis of TCGA data, TOB1 and ESR1 mRNA expression and promoter methylation
correlated positively, suggesting a particular relevance in this setting (Figure S3, B-C). We
also found significant correlation in promoter methylation and mRNA expression for TOB1
and ERBB2, further supporting functional link between TOB1 and HER2 signaling.

Author Manuscript

Interestingly, overexpression of TOB1 was not sufficient to cause estrogen-independent
proliferation of MCF7 cells. When TOB1 was overexpressed by lentiviral infection in MCF7
cells (Figure 2C,D), cellular proliferation was not increased in the absence (Figure 2E) or
presence (Figure 2F) of 1 nM estradiol. These results suggest that the interaction of TOB1
with other proteins differing between estrogen-dependent and estrogen-independent cell
lines was likely to support its role in estrogen-independent growth. We further investigated
the action of TOB1 in this context.
TOB1 control of cell cycle signaling differs in MCF7 versus LCC1 and LCC9 cells

Author Manuscript

Extending our earlier results, a clonogenic analysis indicated that depletion of TOB1
severely depressed the outgrowth of colonies of LCC1 and LCC9, but not MCF7 cells
(Figure 3A,B). Overexpression of TOB1 in LCC1 and LCC9 cells had no effects on cell
growth (Figure S4). Moreover, even higher concentrations of estradiol could not rescue the
cell proliferation arrest induced by TOB1 knockdown (Figure S5). Interestingly, cell cycle
analysis indicated a different basal compartmentalization, with MCF7 having a much higher
proportion of cells in G1 phase (57% for MCF7, versus 34% for LCC1 and 37% for LCC9),
and LCC1 and LCC9 enriched in S phase (25% for MCF7, versus 46% for LCC1 and 47%
for LCC9) (Figure 3C,D). Because TOB1 inhibition has been previously reported to block
G0/G1 to S transition [34], we next investigated the effects of TOB1 knockdown on cell
cycle distribution. siRNA depletion of TOB1 had a minimal impact on cell cycle distribution
in MCF7 cells, but, unexpectedly, caused a significant arrest from G1 to S phase in LCC1
and LCC9 cells (Figure 3C,D). Western analysis indicated that under steady-state growth
conditions, the TOB1 protein was overexpressed (2.8 and 2.7 fold) in LCC1 and LCC9 cells
as compared with MCF7 cells (Figure 3E). This upregulation was transcriptional and
partially post-transcriptional, as TOB1 mRNA levels slightly increased in LCC1 and LCC9
cells (1.5 fold) (Figure S6A). Phosphorylation on TOB1S164 has previously been associated

with reduced anti-proliferative activity [34]; however, although there are higher levels of
phosphorylated TOB1 in LCC1 and LCC9 cells (Figure 3F), our analysis found no
differences in the ratio of this phosphorylation versus total protein in MCF7 and LCC1 cells,
but lower in LCC9 cells (Figure 3G). The relative difference in regulatory phosphorylation
in the two contexts implied an alternative explanation for differing TOB1 protein
functionality associated with acquisition of estrogen independence.
Accordingly, we examined the effects of TOB1 knockdown on G1 regulatory proteins.
TOB1 has been reported to inhibit cell cycle progression by negatively regulating cyclin D1
levels [34, 35]. Strikingly, depletion of TOB1 markedly elevated the expression of cyclin D1
in LCC1 and LCC9 cells as compared with MCF7 cells (Figure 4A, B). In contrast, TOB1
knockdown increased p21 expression in all cell lines (Figure 4A-C).

Author Manuscript

A number of studies have indicated that TOB1 expression regulates radio-sensitivity and
DNA damage responses in cancer cells (e.g., [36]), based on actions with the DNA repair
machinery and in regulation of core survival signaling pathways. We found that basal levels
of γ-H2AX (phosphorylated histone H2AX at serine 139)[37], an indicator of DNA damage,
were higher in MCF7 than in LCC1 or LCC9 cells, but were equally enhanced by TOB1
knockdown in all three lines (Figure 4D-F).
Defining differences in the TOB1-response network in estrogen-independent versus dependent cells

To extensively explore the roles of TOB1 in the survival of estrogen-independent cells and
the impact on the signaling architecture of cancer-focused pathways, we then used reversephase protein array (RPPA) analysis to profile the basal expression and activation/
phosphorylation of 76 key signaling proteins in MCF7, LCC1, and LCC9 cells (Figure
S7A). Not surprisingly, cultured MCF7 cells exhibited significant differences from their
estrogen-independent counterparts, with significantly less activation of important EGFR
network proteins such as mTOR, STAT3, S6 kinase Shc, EGFR, ERBB2, PTEN, and
ERBB3. MCF7 cells also demonstrated relative activation of other signaling molecules such
as Mek1/2, c-Abl, c-Kit, Stat5, IGF-1R and B-Raf. The estrogen-independent cell lines
exhibited fewer variations between each other, but there was more activation of Bad, Met,
VEGFR2, and Aurora Kinase A/B/C in LCC9 cells than in LCC1 cells. In order to focus the
difference of estrogen-independent versus estrogen-dependent cells, molecules that were
common in LCC1 and LCC9, but significantly different in MCF7 cells were uploaded for
canonical pathway enrichment and network analysis (Figure S7B, C). As shown, the ERBB
signaling pathway and its related PI3K/AKT, Erk/MAPK and mTOR signaling pathways
were changed in estrogen-independent cells versus MCF7 cells.
We next performed RPPA analysis in MCF7, LCC1, and LCC9 cells 48 hours after siRNA
depletion of TOB1 or a negative control siRNA (Figure 5 and Figures S8). Figure 5A
describes the expressions of each unmodified or phosphorylated protein in MCF7, LCC1
and LCC9 as a function in the absence (siNeg) and presence (siTOB1) of TOB1 depletion.
Figure 5B then describes the fold-changes in protein or phosphorylated expression in each
cell line as a specific consequence of TOB1 depletion. Consistent with the data shown in

Figure 4, RPPA analysis confirmed that p21 and cyclin D1 were upregulated by siTOB1
knockdown. In order to address the differing responses to TOB1 inhibition in estrogenindependent cells versus estrogen-dependent cells, two groups of molecules were further
analyzed. The first group included molecules that were activated by TOB1 knockdown in
estrogen-independent cells, but reduced in MCF7 cells, such as Src, ERBB2, PKC, ERBB3,
AMPKa, Erk1/2 and IGF-1R/IR (Figure 5B, underlined). The second group contained
4EBP1, MEK1/2, CREB, FADD and Ki67, which were inactivated or downregulated by
siTOB1 in estrogen-independent cells, but activated in MCF7 cells (Figure 5B, black
frame). The canonical pathway enrichment and network analysis of these genes identified
that the TOB1-response network in estrogen-independent cells differed from the parental
estrogen-dependent MCF7 cells. The ERBB, growth hormone, IGF-1R and mTOR signaling
pathways were selectively activated by TOB1 knockdown in estrogen-independent cells
(Figure 5C and E). In contrast, the FGF signaling and death receptor pathways were
inactivated by TOB1 inhibition in LCC1 and LCC9 cells (Figure 5D and E).

Author Manuscript

In addition, we used RT-PCR to analyze a panel of 84 genes relevant to estrogen receptor
signaling for mRNA changes in LCC1 and LCC9 versus MCF7 cells, and specifically
associated with TOB1 depletion (Figure S9). We first asked which genes showed
statistically distinct changes in mRNA expression in the LCC1 and LCC9 versus the MCF7
cells (Figure S9A, B). We then asked which of these changes were reversed in cells
following knockdown of TOB1 (Figure S9C, D); and additionally, which genes showed
distinctive patterns of response to TOB1 knockdown, whether they originally differed in
expression in the MCF7 versus LCC1 and LCC9 cell lines, or not (Figure S9B, D). As these
data indicate, a number of genes relevant to the proliferation of survival of breast tumors
have significantly altered expression in the LCC1 and LCC9 versus the MCF7 cell line,
including those relevant to TGF-beta/BMP, WNT, mitogen and invasion signaling (TGFB3,
IGFBP5, BMP4, WISP2, NRP1, and others); the estrogen receptor itself (ESR1) is induced
in the resistant cell lines.

Author Manuscript

Of this group of genes significantly altered in the ER-resistant derivative lines, knockdown
of TOB1 did reverse changes in the expression of some, such as WISP2, FOS, CYP19A and
TGFA. However, this effect of TOB1 depletion was only seen in LCC1 cells, not in LCC9
cells, and hence is not directly linked to action of TOB1 in the context of resistance to
estrogen. However, in comparing the effect of TOB1 knockdown in the broader list of ERassociated genes, it was notable that this knockdown caused significant reduction of
expression of genes such as the ER-interacting protein NROB2, the differentiationpromoting factor WNT5A, and a small set of other genes in MCF7 cells, but not in LCC1 or
LCC9 cells. These data suggest that one action of TOB1 may be conditioning the landscape
of genes available to support the estrogen signaling apparatus.

TOB1 overexpression has been reported to reduce MEK/ERK- and AKT-dependent
signaling [38], which is potentially relevant to a selective role in estrogen independence
[10]. Moreover, RPPA data and canonical pathway analysis identified that the mTOR

signaling pathway was activated by TOB1 knockdown in LCC1 and LCC9 cells (Figure 5).
We next asked whether TOB1 might influence the response of these cells to inhibitors of
mTOR (rapamycin), AKT (AZD5363) or MEK/ERK (U0126). Knockdown of TOB1
significantly sensitized LCC1 and LCC9 cells to rapamycin (Figure 6B, C) and AZD5363
(Figure 6E, F), while having no effect on response to U0126 (Figure S10, and importantly,
no effect on response to any drug in MCF7 cells (Figures 6A, D). Therefore, TOB1
knockdown in estrogen-independent breast cancer cells potentiates the anti-tumor effects of
clinically relevant signaling inhibitors in this setting. These data also demonstrated that in
LCC1 and LCC9 cells, TOB1 plays proliferative functions parallel with AKT and mTOR
signaling pathways, but in the same signaling pathway as ERK.

Author Manuscript

Finally, TOB1 is known to regulate ERBB2/HER2 signaling, raising the possibility that
inhibition of ERBB2 may phenocopy the effect of depleting TOB1. We compared the effect
of lapatinib, a small molecule inhibitor of ERBB2 and ERBB1/EGFR, versus other targeted
signaling proteins, in MCF7 versus LCC1 and LCC9 cells (Figure S11). Lapatinib had no
effect in MCF7 cells, but in both LCC1 and LCC9 cells, 10 μM lapatinib reduced
proliferation to 30% of untreated cells, representing an effect similar to that of TOB1
knockdown. However, in the siTOB1-transfected cells, no significant sensitization to
lapatinib was observed when compared with siNEG control cells. This pattern was
distinctive, and likely due to action of lapatinib against ERBB2/HER2, as we also assessed
inhibitors of a group of kinases in the HER2 pathway, including EGFR, RAS, and MEK, and
no such distinguishing difference was identified in cells treated with the EGFR inhibitor
erlotinib (Figure S11). These data indicated that the proliferative function of TOB1 is
involved in ERBBB2 related signaling.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

The issue of estrogen independence is of great importance in the clinical management of
breast cancer. Using a functional genomics screening strategy, we show that numerous genes
in an estrogen response-centered network are engaged when estrogen-dependent breast
cancer cells develop estrogen-independence. One of those genes, TOB1, was selected for
deeper analysis because of its potential interactions with other important signaling proteins
relevant to breast cancer, and because of its overexpression in some ER-dependent tumors. A
focused protein pathway activation mapping approach underpinned by protein
phosphorylation analysis and mRNA profiling then provided quantitative information about
the activation levels of canonical cell line-specific signaling events. This approach also
assessed the effects of TOB1 knockdown on those targets and pathways, and identified
signaling changes caused by TOB1 knockdown in estrogen-independent cells. In initially
estrogen-dependent tumors, once anti-estrogen selection is applied, elevated expression of
TOB1 based on transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms is associated with the
development of resistance.
Intriguingly, besides showing that the ability of TOB1 to influence the activity of canonical
effectors such as Cyclin D1 differs between estrogen-dependent and -independent cells, our
work identifies an extended chain of signaling proteins culminating with different expression
profiles of estrogen-related genes that are differentially influenced by TOB1 in these two

environments. Our data also show that depletion of TOB1 selectively sensitizes estrogenindependent cells to clinically important inhibitors of AKT and mTOR. Given growing
evidence linking elevated expression of TOB1 to invasive breast cancers (Figure 2B), these
studies provide important and unexpected insights into potentially targetable mechanisms
that underlie a problem that is at the core of many breast cancer deaths.

Author Manuscript

This is the first study to link TOB1 to the biology of estrogen resistance, since its initial
identification was as a growth inhibitory protein that becomes less active in cells
overexpressing ERBB2 [39]. Erk1/2 and its downstream substrate p90RSK1 could
phosphorylate TOB1, relieving its growth inhibitory activity [34, 40]. In our studies, the
activation of ERBB2 and Erk1/2 by TOB1 inhibition indicated a reverse feedback from a
downstream target (Figure 7B, right panel). Interestingly, another downstream target of
ERBB2 signaling, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, was activated by TOB1 knockdown in
estrogen-independent cells. It is plausible that TOB1 functions in parallel with the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway because TOB1 knockdown potentiates the effects of AKT or
mTOR inhibitors. Moreover, TOB1 inhibition reduced activation of the cCAMP-response
element binding protein (CREB), which is PI3K/Akt dependent [41]. Coupled
transcriptional analysis also indicated that TOB1 depletion differentially affected the
expression profile of estrogen pathway related genes, some of which were relevant the
mitogenic signaling pathways identified in RPPA analysis, further reinforcing the
importance of these pathways. In particular, the mRNA expression differences suggest that
one action of TOB1 may be conditioning the landscape of genes available to support
proliferation and survival signaling.

In addition, the G1/S arrest induced by TOB1 inhibition, which is mediated by up-regulation
of p21 indicates TOB1 supports estrogen-independent cell growth by promoting G1/S cell
cycle transition and suggests that cells treated with siTOB1s might senesce[42] because
TOB1 inhibition could not induce apoptosis (Figure 1F). As summarized in Figure 7,
TOB1 plays a proliferative function in a growth factor receptor network in estrogenindependent cells. Briefly, the transition from estrogen-dependence (Figure 7A, left panel)
to estrogen-independence (Figure 7B, left panel) utilizes growth factors including EGFR,
the ERBB family and IGF1R to activate at least two pathways that promote estrogenindependent cell proliferation. One is mediated by PI3K/AKT, which regulates translation
and transcription of proliferative genes (reviewed in [43]), and cell cycle progression to
support estrogen-independent growth. The second signaling pathway, which is downstream
of these growth factors, is mediated through Ras/Raf/MAPK signaling [44, 45]. TOB1 is
phosphorylated by Erk1/2 to promote estrogen-independent proliferation by facilitating
G1/S cell cycle transition. TOB1 is also involved in CREB1 activation to regulate its impact
on target gene transcription. When TOB1 is knocked down (Figure 7B, right panel) these
pro-proliferative activities are reversed, in concert with p21-mediated G1/S arrest.
Various anti-estrogen agents have been employed in sequence to address the estrogenindependence and acquisition of anti-estrogen resistance that lead to relapse and eventual
death in many women with ER+ breast cancer. Despite a wealth of information about
specific mechanisms that might be attacked [5-13, 46], the context in which those
mechanisms are addressed (typically as mono-therapy, and rarely in combinations designed

to disable resistance mechanisms) is so complex that additional resistant cell subpopulations almost always emerge to defeat these therapies. Recent studies show that antiestrogens can be combined with cell cycle-directed treatments with promising anti-tumor
activity [47, 48]. Such data are in accord with our studies, and that of many others showing
activation of components of the ERBB signaling network in hormone-resistant breast cancer
cells. Our data suggest that many proteins are likely to collaborate to generate this estrogenresistant phenotype, making it imperative to identify critical nodes that can be interdicted
alone, or in combination to disable this process. Our work identified that TOB1 supports the
estrogen-independent cell survival, and that its function is closely linked to that of ERBB2/
HER2, with HER2 inhibition partially phenocopying TOB1 knockdown. However, while
TOB1 is not the sole mediator of estrogen-independence, its known anti-proliferative
functions within the ERBB signaling network [33, 34, 40] argue for its further study to
investigate how it and its collaborating proteins might be disabled to prevent the emergence
of estrogen-independence in ER+ breast cancer. In the future, it will be important to extend
the analysis of TOB1 and the signaling paradigm identified in this study to the analysis of
other independent systems for intrinsic versus acquired estrogen resistance.
These studies demonstrate the diversity and flexibility of survival mechanisms as breast
cancer cells develop estrogen independence. Interestingly, many different genes contribute to
survival in this setting, challenging previous conventions that estrogen independence and
resistance to anti-estrogen drugs involve the gradual accumulation of resistance mechanisms.
Because TOB1 is not an identified druggable target, these results cannot be validated in vivo
at this time. However, the translational significance of this new molecular mechanism of
estrogen independence in human breast cancer will be fully determined when TOB1
inhibitors are developed to enable in vivo validation studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture and Chemicals

Author Manuscript

Cell lines used in these studies are from Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center,
Georgetown University. Cells are tested for mycoplasma negative. For information on
medium and assay reagents used for each cell line see Supplementary Information.
HEK293T cells were grown in DMEM containing 10%FBS and 2mM L-glutamine. Cell
lines were maintained at 37°C and 5% CO2. Estradiol was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis,
MO) and prepared at 1 mM in ethanol. AZD5363 and rapamycin were purchased from
Selleckchem (Houston, TX) and prepared at 10 mM in DMSO. Drug stock aliquots were
kept at −20 °C. All drugs were diluted to desired concentrations in full medium immediately
before each experiment. The final DMSO concentrations did not exceed 0.1%.
RNAi Screening
An ER-centered network was developed using the open source software tool, Cytoscape,
using methods described in detail in [15]. The ER-centered siRNA library was customordered from Qiagen (Germantown, MD) in a 96-well plate format with a single well
representing one of the 631 genes identified as part of the ER-centered network. Each well
contained 2-pooled siRNAs, targeting different sequences of the same gene. siRNAs were

resuspended in RNase free water at 1 μM. Cell density and transfection reagent for cells
were listed in Supplementary Information. Cells were reversed transfected with the ERcentered siRNA library at 20 nM and incubated for 144 hours. Viability for each targeted
gene was measured as described below and normalized to median value of 14 non-silencing
controls on the plate. In each cell line, RNAi screening were repeated three or four times.
siRNA Validation

Author Manuscript

Viability data from three or four experimental replicates experiments were statistically
analyzed. Those siRNAs with adjusted p values < 0.05 were considered to be significantly
different from the siNEG control, and were considered to be hits if they caused at a loss of
50% viability or more in target cell lines, as reflecting a robust biological effect. Using this
cut-off, only about 1% of all gene knockdowns met the criteria for hits in the estrogendependent MCF7 cell line. For each hit identified, four different siRNAs (Qiagen, MD)
targeting the same gene were tested for validation studies in individual wells. Two out of the
four siRNAs were the same target sequences as the siRNAs in the screen, when available.
The other two siRNAs were new sequences to test. Cells were screened as described above.
If at least two out of four of the siRNAs tested reduced viability by at least 50%, the
candidate passed validation as a putative hit.
Caspase 7 activity
Cells were reversed transfected with siRNAs at 20nM in triplicate and incubated for 120
hours. Caspase 7 activity was measured using Apo-ONE as described by Promega (#G7790,
Madison, WI). Caspase 7 activity for each gene knockdown was calculated by normalizing
to median fluorescence values of non-silencing controls on the plate.

Reverse Phase Protein Array
TOB1 or negative scrambled siRNAs with final concentration of 10 nM were reversetransfected into cells for 48 h. At each sample, triplicates of each transfection were harvested
for RPPA analysis [49]. Antibodies used for RPPA were listed in Supplementary
Information.
Bromodeoxyuridine Incorporation
After 30 min of pulse labeling with 50 μM bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd, BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA), cells were collected, stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)conjugated anti-BrdUrd antibody (BD Biosciences, #347583, San Jose, CA) and analyzed
with a FACScan flow cytometer (BD Biosciences)[50].

Western blot
Cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed. 25~50 μg of protein was used for Western
blotting. Primary antibodies against TOB1 (#ab79372) and phosphorylated-TOB1
(#ab78915) were purchased from Abcam Inc. (Boston, MA). Antibodies against
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (#5174), p21 (#2947), and Cyclin D1
(#2922) were purchased from Cell Signaling Tech. (Beverly, MA). Anti-phosphorylatedH2AX (γH2AX, clone JBW301) was purchased from Upstate Biotech (Millipore, Billerica,

by Adobe Photoshop software.
Cell Viability Assay
CellTiter Blue® (Promega, #G8081, Madison, WI) viability assay or CellTiter 96® AQueous
One Solution Cell Proliferation assay (Promega, #3582) was used to measure cell viability
according to manufacture's manuals. For crystal violet staining method, cells were stained
with 0.52% crystal violet for 10 min and rinsed with ddH2O. Crystal violet was dissolved
with 100 mM sodium citrate and absorbance at 570 nm was read. Cell viability was
calculated as a percentage of the untreated cells.
TOB1 overexpression in MCF7 cells

Author Manuscript

TOB1 contained within pLOC-TURBO RFP lentiviral constructs were obtained from
Thermo Scientific Open Biosystems (#OHS5834-EG10140, Pittsburgh, PA). HEK293T cells
were transfected at 60-70% confluence with 6 μg pLOC-TOB1 (or empty vector), 3 μg
psPAX2 and 0.3 μg VSV-G plasmids using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Promega,
#E2691). Cells were infected at 30% confluence using 3 mL virus containing media, 1 mL
normal growth media and 3.2 μg of polybrene. Media was replaced 24 hrs following
transduction with normal growth media and at 48 hrs with media containing blasticidin S
(Sigma; #15205, 10 μg/ml for MCF7, 11 μg/mL for LCC1 and LCC9 cells). Selection
continued for 7 days and TOB1 overexpression was confirmed by Western blotting.

Forty eight hours after transfection of siTOB1 or siNEG, lysates of MCF7, LCC1 and LCC9
cells were assessed by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) analysis (see Methods). A.
Heatmap representing levels of proteins or phosphorylated proteins in negative control or
TOB1 siRNA-transfected MCF7, LCC1, and LCC9 cells. Data shown as average from
triplicates of each RPPA samples normalized by row-based z-score. B. Heatmap
representing log-2 normalized fold change values of proteins or phospho-proteins (siTOB1
vs. siNEG). Blue color indicated decrease and yellow color indicated increase. Purple
underlines indicate molecules that were up-regulated by siTOB1 in estrogen-independent
cells, but down-regulated in MCF7 cells. The black frame indicates molecules that were
down-regulated by siTOB1 in estrogen-independent cells, but up-regulated in MCF7 cells. *
FDR-adjusted p-values<0.05, versus MCF7. C-D. The network representing the small group
of genes showing differences between MCF7 and estrogen-independent cells as derived by
Ingenuity. C. Signaling network derived from proteins SRC, ERBB2, PKCα, ERBB3,
Cleaved Caspase 9, AMPKα, ERK1/2, IGF1R (underlined in panel B). D. Signaling network
derived from proteins 4EBP1, MEK1/2, CREB, FADD, Ki67 (contained within the frame –
panel B). For each colored gene node, the color on the left side indicates regulation in MCF7
cells, and the right, in estrogen-independent cells. Red, up-regulated by siTOB1; green,
down-regulated by siTOB1. Non-colored gene nodes were automatically introduced by
Ingenuity. E. The canonical pathways enriched in genes differentially regulated by siTOB1
in estrogen-independent cells versus MCF7 cells as identified by Ingenuity. * indicates
pathways enriched in molecules down-regulated by siTOB1 in estrogen-independent cells.

A. The estrogen receptor-dominated cell growth in estrogen-dependent cells. E2, estradiol.
B-C. The TOB1-related signaling pathways in estrogen-independent cells. B: Briefly,
Growth factors receptors including EGFR, ERBB family, IGF1R etc. activate two pathways
to promote estrogen-independent cell proliferation. One is mediated by PI3K/AKT, which
regulates translation and transcription of proliferative genes, and cell cycle progression, then
supports estrogen-independent growth. Ras/Raf/MAPK mediates the second signaling
pathway downstream of growth factor receptors. TOB1 is phosphorylated by Erk1/2 to
promote estrogen-independent proliferation by facilitating G1/S cell cycle phase transition.
C: In the presence of TOB1 inhibition, up-regulation of p21 results in G1/S arrest.
Additionally, transcription can be inhibited by TOB1 knockdown. Reduction of CreB1
phosphorylation by TOB1 inhibition can reduce its proliferative target gene transcription,
and then inhibit cell growth. However, growth factor receptors such as ERBB2 and IGFIR
are activated as a reverse feedback mechanism, the PI3/AKT pathway is activated by TOB1
inhibition. Inhibition of AKT or mTOR potentiates the effects of TOB1 inhibition on cell
proliferation in estrogen-independent cells.
