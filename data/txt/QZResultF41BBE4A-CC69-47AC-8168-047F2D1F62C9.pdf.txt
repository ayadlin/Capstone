Abstract:
Our aim was to investigate both the prevalence of MET amplification in gastric
cancer as well as the potential of this genetic alteration to serve as a therapeutic
target in gastric cancer. MET amplification was assessed by initial screening with a
PCR-based copy number assay followed by confirmatory FISH analysis in formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of gastric cancer obtained at surgery. The
effects of MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors (MET-TKIs) in gastric cancer cells with or
without MET amplification were also examined. The median MET copy number in 266
cases of gastric cancer was 1.7, with a range of 0.41 to 21.3. We performed FISH
analysis for the 15 cases with the highest MET copy numbers. MET amplification was
confirmed in the four assessable cases with a MET copy number of at least 4, whereas
MET amplification was not detected in those with a gene copy number of <4. The
prevalence of MET amplification was thus 1.5% (4 out of 266 cases). Inhibition of
MET by MET-TKIs resulted in the induction of apoptosis accompanied by attenuation
of downstream MET signaling in gastric cancer cell lines with MET amplification but
not in those without this genetic change. MET amplification identifies a small but
clinically important subgroup of gastric cancer patients who are likely to respond to
MET-TKIs. Furthermore, screening with a PCR-based copy number assay is an efficient
way to reduce the number of patients requiring confirmation of MET amplification by
FISH analysis.

Introduction

tumors accounting for 7 to 17% of all gastric cancers [911]. Further research is thus warranted to identify new
therapeutic targets for gastric cancer patients.
The MET proto-oncogene encodes the receptor
tyrosine kinase c-MET. The binding of its ligand,
hepatocyte growth factor, to MET results in tyrosine
phosphorylation of the receptor and activation of
downstream signaling molecules. Oncogenic activation
of MET suppresses apoptosis and promotes cell survival,
proliferation, migration, and differentiation as well as
gene transcription and angiogenesis [12]. In gastric
cancer, such activation of MET has been attributed to

Gastric cancer is the third most common cause
of death from malignant disease in men (fifth in
women) worldwide [1]. The prognosis for patients
with unresectable advanced or recurrent gastric cancer
remains poor, with a median survival time of less than 1
year in individuals receiving conventional therapy [2-8].
The combination of trastuzumab, an antibody targeted
to HER2, with chemotherapy has yielded a survival

gene amplification [13-15]. However, the prevalence of
MET amplification has varied among studies [13-21],
possibly as a result of differences in the methods applied.
This uncertainty led us to determine the prevalence
of MET amplification in 266 formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded (FFPE) specimens of gastric cancer obtained
during surgery. To ensure the efficient detection of MET
amplification, we adopted a sequential approach involving
PCR-based determination of gene copy number followed
by confirmatory FISH analysis. Moreover, to assess the
potential of MET amplification as a therapeutic target in
gastric cancer, we investigated its impact on cell survival
and signal transduction.

amplification status was previously determined [22]. In
gastric cancer cell lines negative for MET amplification,
including KATO III, SNU1, SNU216, MKN1, MKN7,
HSC39, MKN28, and NUGC3, the copy number of MET
as determined by the PCR-based assay ranged between
1.3 and 3.3. In contrast, cell lines positive for MET
amplification, including Hs746T, MKN45, and SNU5,
showed MET copy numbers of 21.3, 21.3, and 17.9,
respectively. The PCR-based assay thus revealed a high
copy number for MET only in gastric cancer cell lines
previously shown to be positive for MET amplification by
FISH.

Results

To determine the prevalence of MET amplification
in advanced gastric cancer, we examined 266 FFPE
specimens of surgically resected primary gastric
tumors. Most of the patients were male (68.8%) and
had undifferentiated-type gastric cancer (62.8%),
including mucinous adenocarcinoma, signet ring
cell adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated

with a range of 31 to 91 years.
The PCR-based assay revealed that the median MET
copy number for the 266 cases was 1.7, with a range of
0.41 to 21.3 copies (Figure 2A). Given that gastric cancer
cell lines with MET amplification have been found to have

a high copy number for MET [23], we arranged all cases
in the order of MET copy number and performed FISH
analysis for the 15 cases with the highest copy numbers
(Table 2). MET amplification was detected by FISH in
four of these cases (G72, G289, G322, and G181), which
had a MET copy number of at least 4, whereas six cases

lines

(G276, G233, G295, G170, G307, and G231) with a copy
number of less than 4 did not exhibit MET amplification
(Figure 2B, Table 2). The remaining five cases (G331,
G223, G217, G118, and G42) were not assessable by FISH
analysis because of a lack of hybridization signals.
We thus identified four out of 266 gastric cancer
patients (1.5%) as having MET amplification. The clinical
features of patients with or without MET amplification
are shown in Tables 2 and 3. All four patients with MET
amplification had undifferentiated-type gastric cancer.
We further examined the prognostic impact of MET
amplification for all 266 patients but found that OS after
surgery did not differ significantly between those with or
without MET amplification (log-rank test, P = 0.3).

To investigate the biological impact of MET
amplification in gastric cancer, we first examined the
effects of two highly selective MET receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (MET-TKIs), JNJ38877605 and
SGX523, on the growth of gastric cancer cell lines positive
or negative for MET amplification. The IC50 values of
JNJ3887605 and SGX523 for inhibition of cell growth
were 0.02 to 0.05 μM and 0.06 to 0.07 μM, respectively,
for cells positive for MET amplification, whereas they
were >10 μM for MET amplification–negative cells
(Figure 3A). An annexin V binding assay revealed that
both MET-TKIs induced a substantial level of apoptosis in
MET amplification–positive cells but were largely without

effect in cell lines without MET amplification (Figure 3B).
Immunoblot analysis showed that the MET-TKIs inhibited
the phosphorylation of MET, AKT, ERK, and STAT3 in
gastric cancer cells with MET amplification, whereas
they had no effect on signaling events in those negative
for MET amplification (Figure 3C). These findings thus
indicated that gastric cancer cells with MET amplification
are predominantly dependent on MET signaling for
their growth and survival and are therefore rendered
hypersensitive to MET-TKIs.

hand, an increase in MET copy number was found in 10 to
20% of gastric cancer patients by Southern blot analysis
[17-19] or with a PCR-based assay [28, 29]. An increase
in gene copy number in malignant tumors can result from
at least two genetic mechanisms, gene amplification and
polysomy. Gene amplification refers to a copy number
gain for a specific gene (or group of genes) on a given
chromosome arm without a change in copy number for
genes located in other regions of the chromosome [30],
whereas polysomy gives rise to a copy number gain for a
given gene as a result of the presence of extra copies of the
entire chromosome. Southern blot analysis and PCR-based
copy number assays recognize a gain in gene copy number
regardless of the underlying cause and are thus unable to
distinguish gene amplification from polysomy, a limitation
that is sometimes overlooked, with consequences for
determination of the true prevalence of MET amplification
in gastric cancer.
FISH analysis is a semiquantitative method that can
be performed with two probes for determination of the
number of signals for a target gene and for the centromeric

Discussion
Activation of MET signaling promotes tumor cell
growth, survival, migration, and invasion as well as tumor
angiogenesis [24]. In gastric cancer, gain-of-function
mutations of MET are exceedingly rare [25-27], with
MET activation having been attributed mostly to gene
amplification [13-15]. Previous studies based on FISH
analysis have detected MET amplification in up to 4%
of patients with gastric cancer [14, 16, 20]. On the other

portion of the corresponding chromosome. Given that the
number of centromeric signals directly reflects the copy
number of the chromosome, FISH analysis yields the
copy number gain for the target gene from the ratio of
the copy number of the gene to that of the chromosome.
FISH is thus the gold standard for detection of gene
amplification. However, the identification and counting
of FISH signals are hampered by many factors including
cutting artifacts, nuclear overlap, and heterogeneity of
tumor specimens. Moreover, FISH is expensive and timeconsuming, and it requires technical expertise [31]. The
efficient determination of gene amplification in a large
number of tumor specimens would thus benefit from
the availability of a high-throughput screening assay.
In this regard, PCR-based assays for determination of
gene copy number are simple to perform and rapidly
yield quantitative and reproducible results. Given that,
among tumors showing a gain in gene copy number, those
confirmed to be positive for gene amplification show the
greatest increases in gene copy number [21, 23, 32, 33],
we investigated the potential of a PCR-based assay for
screening in order to select cases of gastric cancer for
confirmation of MET amplification by FISH. We thus
performed PCR-based screening for MET copy number
in 266 surgically resected specimens of gastric cancer
and then applied FISH analysis to the 15 cases showing
the highest gene copy numbers. MET amplification was
confirmed by FISH in four cases among the five with
a MET copy number of at least 4; the remaining case
(G331) was not assessable by FISH because of a lack of
hybridization signals. MET amplification was not detected
in the cases with a gene copy number of <4. We therefore
identified MET amplification at a frequency of 1.5% (4 out
of 266 cases), consistent with values determined by FISH
analysis in recent studies of gastric cancer [16, 20]. Our

results thus suggest that screening for MET amplification
with a PCR-based assay is an efficient means with which
to reduce the number of specimens requiring evaluation by
FISH analysis. As mentioned above, one specimen (G331)
in the present study showed a high MET copy number
(6.14 copies) but could not be confirmed positive for MET
amplification because of the lack of a FISH result. The
issue of how to identify MET amplification status in such
cases remains to be resolved.
We examined the biological impact of MET
amplification in gastric cancer cells by comparing the
effects of the MET-TKIs JNJ38877605 and SGX523
between gastric cancer cell lines positive for MET
amplification and those negative for this genetic alteration.
In gastric cancer cells with MET amplification, the
MET-TKIs markedly inhibited AKT, ERK, and STAT3
signaling and triggered apoptosis, whereas such effects
were not evident in cells without MET amplification. To
investigate whether attenuation of MET signaling by the
MET-TKIs is related to the induction of apoptosis, we
transfected gastric cancer cell lines with an siRNA specific
for MET mRNA. Such transfection inhibited MET signal
transduction as well as induced apoptosis in gastric cancer
cell lines with MET amplification but not in those without
it (data not shown). Our observations thus indicate that
gastric cancer cell lines positive for MET amplification
depend predominantly on constitutive activation of the
encoded growth factor receptor for their survival and
thus show high sensitivity to cell killing by MET-TKIs.
Targeting of MET signaling by MET-TKIs is therefore
a potentially valuable therapeutic approach for patients
with MET amplification–positive gastric cancer. Indeed,
the MET-TKI crizotinib (PF-02341066) was recently
found to induce a radiographic response (partial response)
and rapid clinical improvement in patients with advanced

gastric cancer who were found to be positive for MET
amplification by FISH [16]. Further investigation of the
efficacy of MET-TKIs in patients with advanced gastric
cancer positive for MET amplification is thus warranted.
Given the potential of MET-targeted therapy for
gastric cancer with MET amplification, it is important to
determine the prevalence of such gene amplification in
patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer, most of
whom are currently treated with systemic chemotherapy.
Our present study was limited to gastric cancer patients
who underwent gastrectomy, and so further studies will be
needed for patients with unresectable advanced tumors.
Given the apparent low prevalence of MET amplification
in gastric cancer, implementation of a sequential approach
including screening with a PCR-based copy number assay
followed by confirmatory FISH analysis should facilitate
the identification of MET amplification in a large cohort of
patients with unresectable advanced gastric cancer.

Macrodissection of the surgical specimens preserved
as FFPE tissue was performed after removal of paraffin in
order to select a region of cancer tissue. Genomic DNA
was extracted from the cancer tissue with the use of a
QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The
DNA concentration of the extracts was determined with
a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA).

PCR-based determination of MET copy number
The copy number of MET was determined with
the use of a TaqMan Copy Number Assay [32] and the
Hs05005660_cn (intron 16) primer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). The TERT locus was used as the internal
reference, and DNA from noncancerous FFPE tissue was
used as a normal control. Real-time PCR was performed
in a total volume of 20 µL per well containing 10 µL of
TaqMan genotyping master mix, 20 ng of genomic DNA,
and each primer. The amplification protocol included
an initial incubation at 95ºC for 10 min followed by 40
cycles of 95ºC for 15 s and 60ºC for 1 min. The resulting
products were detected with the use of ABI Prism 7900HT
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems). Data
were analyzed with SDS 2.2 software and Copy Caller
software (Applied Biosystems).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
The human gastric cancer cell lines SNU1, SNU5
and Hs746T were obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA); MKN1, MKN7, MKN45,
and NUGC3 were from the Health Science Research
Resources Bank (Japan Health Sciences Foundation,
Tokyo, Japan); KATO III, MKN28, and HSC39 were
from Immuno-Biological Laboratories (Gunma, Japan);
and SNU216 was from the Korean Cell Line Bank (Seoul
National University, Seoul, Korea). All of the cell lines
were maintained under a humidified atmosphere of 5%
CO2 at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco
BRL, Grand Island, NY), penicillin, and streptomycin.

FISH
MET copy number per cell was determined by
FISH with the use of the c-met / CEN7p Dual Color FISH
Probe (GSP Laboratory, Kawasaki, Japan) [22], where
CEN7p is the centromeric region of chromosome 7p.
The signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy
and were evaluated by independent observers (H.K. and
I.O.). After screening all entire sections, images of tumor
cells were captured and recorded and the signals for 60
random nuclei were counted for an area where individual
cells were recognized in at least 10 representative images.
Nuclei with a disrupted boundary were excluded from the
analysis. Gene amplification was strictly defined by a mean
MET/CEN7p copy number ratio of >2.2, corresponding
to a previous definition of MET amplification [16]. The
presence of polysomy or an equivocal MET/CEN7p ratio
(1.8 to 2.2) were thus scored as negative for amplification.

Patients
A total of 267 patients with histologically confirmed
gastric cancer who had undergone surgery at the National
Cancer Center Hospital (Tokyo, Japan) between 1996
and 2006 were included in the study. All the patients had
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
status of 0 to 2. One patient was subsequently excluded
as a result of an insufficient quantity of DNA extracted
from the corresponding tissue specimen. The specimens
from the remaining 266 patients were thus analyzed. The
present study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the National Cancer Center Hospital, and
informed consent was obtained from all subjects.
