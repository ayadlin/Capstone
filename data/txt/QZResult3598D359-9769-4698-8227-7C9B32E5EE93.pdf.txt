Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Although the role of Hedgehog (Hh) signalling in embryonic pattern formation is well
established1, its functions in adult tissue renewal and maintenance remain unclear, and the
relationship of these functions to cancer development has not been determined. Here we show that
the lossof Smoothened (Smo), an essential component of the Hh pathway2, impairs haematopoietic
stem cell renewal and decreases induction of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) by the BCR–
ABL1 oncoprotein3. Loss of Smo causes depletion of CML stem cells—the cells that propagate the
leukaemia—whereas constitutively active Smo augments CML stem cell number and accelerates
disease. As a possible mechanism for Smo action, we show that the cell fate determinant Numb,
which depletes CML stem cells, is increased in the absence of Smo activity. Furthermore,
pharmacological inhibition of Hh signalling impairs not only the propagation of CML driven by wildtype BCR–ABL1, but also the growth of imatinib-resistant mouse and human CML. These data
indicate that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of normal and neoplastic stem cells of
the haematopoietic system and raise the possibility that the drug resistance and disease recurrence
associated with imatinib treatment of CML4,5 might be avoided by targeting this essential stem cell
maintenance pathway.

CML arises owing to a translocation between the BCR serine/threonine kinase gene and the
ABL1 tyrosine kinase3. Imatinib mesylate, which binds to the ABL1 kinase domain and inhibits
phosphorylation of substrates, has been used to treat CML, but it is not curative because the
cancer stem cells that propagate the leukaemia are resistant to therapy and are not
eradicated5–7. Furthermore, imatinib resistance due to mutations in the drug-binding site can
occur, especially in advanced stage disease, leading to disease relapse and progression4. The
design of effective new therapies thus critically depends on the identification of signals that
are required for CML propagation and in particular signals required for CML cancer stem cell
maintenance.
Given the parallels in signalling between development and cancer8,9, we examined whether
Hh signalling, an important regulator of development and oncogenesis in many tissues1,10,
might also have a role in CML. To this end we conditionally deleted Smo—a protein that is
essential for Hh signal transduction2. Smo is negatively regulated by the Hh receptor Patched
(Ptch) in the absence of Hh protein signals. This inhibition is relieved when Ptch is bound by
the Hh proteins Shh, Ihh or Dhh. Subsequently, Smo causes activation of Hh pathway targets
via the Gli family of transcriptional effectors2.

Smo was deleted in the haematopoietic system by crossing mice carrying a loxP-flanked
Smo allele11 to mice in which Cre is driven by Vav regulatory elements12. Smo was efficiently
deleted in haematopoietic cells of Vav-Cre;SmoloxP/loxP mice as compared to control
SmoloxP/loxP mice lacking Cre (Fig. 1a, b). Although the frequency of haematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) and differentiated cells was unchanged in the Smo-deficient (Smo−/−) mice
(Supplementary Fig. 1), these animals had a clear defect in long-term HSC function in primary
and secondary transplants (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Fig. 1). Decreased reconstitution was
not due to decreased homing or to a preferential loss of any specific lineage (Supplementary
Figs 1 and 2), and could be recapitulated with whole bone marrow transplants (Supplementary
Fig. 3). Cumulatively, these data indicate that Smo is required for HSC renewal in vivo.

We next investigated the role of Hh signalling in CML initiation and propagation. CML can
be modelled by transplanting BCR–ABL1-transduced haematopoietic progenitors into
irradiated mice13. Whereas control cells transduced with BCR–ABL1 caused CML in 94% (16
out of 17) of recipients within 3 months, similarly transduced Smo−/− cells caused CML in only
47% (8 out of 17) of recipients (Fig. 1d), and these tumours showed an increased latency. The
reduced CML incidence was not due to altered homing or engraftment (Supplementary Fig.
4). These data suggest that Hh activity is required for the initiation and propagation of CML.
The propagation of several cancers has been shown to depend on cancer stem cells, a critical
subset of cancer cells that are capable of transferring the disease to a new host8. Because
deletion of Smo led to impaired CML growth, we postulated that the loss of Smo might affect
CML stem cells. As shown in Fig. 1e, f, the frequency of c-Kit+ Lin− Sca-1+ (KLS) cells (which
have previously been shown to be responsible for propagating CML6) was significantly
reduced in the absence of Smo.
The fact that loss of Smo led to decreased numbers of CML stem cells led us to investigate
whether activation of the Hh pathway might lead to an increased frequency of CML stem cells
and acceleration of disease. To test this, we used a transgenic mouse expressing an activated
form of Smo (SmoM2) fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)14; expression of this gene
from the Rosa26 locus promoter is blocked by a loxP-flanked stop sequence, and is thus
inducible by Cre. When SmoM2–YFP mice were crossed with Vav-Cre mice, progeny
expressed YFP in >70% of c-Kit+ Lin−/lo Sca-1+ Flk2− (KLSF) cells (Fig. 2a). Although the
infection of both control and SmoM2 KLSF cells with BCR–ABL1 resulted in CML, the
frequency of CML stem cells in animals receiving SmoM2 cells was fourfold greater than in
mice receiving control cells (Fig. 2b, c). As expected, SmoM2 was expressed in transgenic but

not in control CML stem cells (Fig. 2d). Most importantly, the increased CML stem cell
frequency led to a significant acceleration of CML progression (Fig. 2e). SmoM2 expression
also accelerated CML growth when activated post-embryonically (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Thus genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments indicate that Hh pathway activity controls
the frequency and maintenance of CML stem cells, and consequently the incidence and latency
of CML formation.
Our previous studies suggested that in normal haematopoietic stem cells, maintenance of the
undifferentiated state depends on low levels of the cell fate determinant Numb15. We therefore
tested whether Numb may act similarly in CML stem cells, and whether the effects of loss of
Smo might be due to altered levels of Numb. We found that a greater frequency of Smo−/−
CML KLS cells had high levels of Numb as compared to control CML KLS cells (Fig. 3a–c).
Additionally, ectopically expressed Numb inhibited in vitro propagation of BCR–ABL1infected haematopoietic cells (Fig. 3d) and of CML stem cells from established leukaemias
(Fig. 3e). These data suggest that increased Numb expression may contribute to the loss of
CML stem cells in the absence of Smo.

Our genetic data showing that CML stem cells depend on Hh pathway activity raised the
possibility that these cells might be targeted by pharmacological blockade of this pathway. We
therefore tested the effect of cyclopamine, which inhibits Hh signalling by stabilizing Smo in
its inactive form16. Exposure of CML stem cells to cyclopamine at a dose determined to
minimize off-target effects and toxicity (Supplementary Fig. 6) led to a twofold inhibition of
colony growth (Fig. 4a). This could be recapitulated using the Hh-blocking antibody 5E1
(Supplementary Fig. 7), suggesting that Hh pathway activation in CML may be ligand
dependent17,18. We also delivered cyclopamine to animals transplanted with BCR–ABL1infected HSCs; whereas all of the control animals succumbed to CML within 4 weeks, 60%
of the cyclopamine-treated mice were still alive after 7 weeks (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig.
8). Furthermore cyclopamine-treated mice had up to a 14-fold reduction in the CML stem cell
population (Fig. 4c, d); consistent with this depletion, leukaemias from cyclopamine-treated
mice were unable to propagate disease effectively when transplanted (Supplementary Fig. 9).
These data suggest that cyclopamine can target the CML stem cell compartment critical for
propagation of CML. Notably cyclopamine was most effective when initiated at early stages
after CML establishment (Supplementary Fig. 10).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

One rationale for identifying new pathways involved in CML is that targeting these pathways
may be used to prevent or overcome imatinib resistance19. To test whether cyclopamine could
impair the growth of imatinib-resistant CML, we infected cells with virus encoding either wildtype BCR–ABL1 or the T315I mutant4,6,20 that is resistant to imatinib and other tyrosine kinase
inhibitors used at present. Cells infected with mutant BCR–ABL1 were unresponsive to
imatinib (Fig. 4e), but their growth was reduced 2.5-fold by cyclopamine (Fig. 4e). Progression
of drug-resistant CML in vivo was also significantly impaired in the presence of cyclopamine
(Fig. 4f) as well as in the genetic absence of Smo (Supplementary Fig. 11). These data indicate
that Hh pathway activity is required for maintenance of CML stem cells, and raise the
possibility that small molecule inhibitors of the pathway could be useful for targeting both
normal and imatinib-resistant CML.
Finally we tested whether targeting this pathway could inhibit the growth of human CML.
Freshly isolated primary human blast crisis CML samples expressed SMO (Fig. 4g). To
determine whether SMO may functionally contribute to human CML growth, we tested the
effect of cyclopamine on both a human CML cell line and patient samples in a methylcellulose
assay. Cyclopamine decreased colony formation in an imatinib-resistant human CML cell line
(Fig. 4h) and in three independent primary patient samples (Fig. 4i and Supplementary Fig.
12), but not in untransformed cord blood cells (Supplementary Fig. 13). Consistent with this,

inhibition of SMO by the delivery of a new SMO antagonist also impaired the propagation of
imatinib-resistant human CML cells in xenografts (A.A., M.M., T.V.A. and C.H.J., manuscript
in preparation). Cumulatively, these data suggest that Hh signalling is important for human
CML growth and that it may continue to have a role even as the disease progresses into blast
crisis phase.

The studies discussed earlier demonstrate a dependence of normal and neoplastic stem cells
on Hh signalling. Previously, mammalian Hh proteins have been reported to preserve and
increase the short-term repopulating capacity of human HSCs21. Our genetic loss-of-function
studies indicate that intact Hh signalling is needed for HSC renewal. This requirement may be
shared with the nervous system, in which progenitor development is dependent on Hh pathway
activation22,23. Just as Hh signalling seems to be required for stem cells, its aberrant activation
has been associated with the development of several solid cancers17,18,24,25. In the
haematopoietic system, Hh signalling has been implicated in the growth of B cell
lymphoma26 and multiple myeloma27. Our observations provide critical genetic evidence for
a role of Hh signalling in myeloid leukaemia, and together with previous work, suggest that
this pathway may have a broader role in haematological malignancies. Our data are also unique
in demonstrating that loss of endogenous cancer stem cells impairs in vivo cancer progression,
supporting the notion that the leukaemia stem cells identified by transplantation are the relevant
drivers of endogenous cancer growth28–30. The real impetus for identification of new pathways
that drive cancer is the opportunity to inhibit these pathways instead of, or in addition to,
conventional therapies. This is especially true for CML, in which imatinib is incapable of
eradicating the disease, not only necessitating its continual use but also increasing the
likelihood of resistance and relapse. Our findings that the pharmacological inhibition of Hh
signalling can impair growth of CML driven by wild-type and imatinib-resistant BCR–ABL1,
as well as human CML, raise the possibility that Hh antagonists may be useful as a therapy for
normal and drug resistant CML.

METHODS SUMMARY
For CML assays, HSCs were infected with MSCV-BCR-ABL1-IRES-GFP or MSCV-IRESGFP (control) and transplanted into recipient mice. CML was assessed by flow cytometry and
histopathology. Pharmacological inhibition of Hh was initiated 6–8 days after transplantation
by delivering 25 mg kg−1 of cyclopamine twice a day by oral gavage. Treatment was continued
for five consecutive days, stopped for two days and then continued once a day until the mice
were analysed after signs of leukaemia. For human CML studies, peripheral blood CD34+ cells
were sorted and plated in methylcellulose in tomatidine or cyclopamine.

METHODS
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mice
The Smo−/− and Smo+/+ mice used were in a mixed 129X1/SvJ and C57BL/6J background.
Transplant recipients (C57BL/6 CD45.1) were 8–10 weeks of age. All mice were bred and
maintained on acidified, antibiotic water in the animal care facility at Duke University Medical
Center. All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Duke
University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

HSC isolation and analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Isolation of HSCs from bone marrow and their transplantation for in vivo analysis of function
were performed as described12. For analysis of lineage markers, bone marrow cells from
control or Smo−/− mice were incubated with antibodies to murine Ter119 (also known as Ly76),
Mac-1 (Itgam), B220 (Ptprc) and CD3 (Cd3e) (eBiosciences), and analysed by FACS. For the
reconstitution assays, bone marrow cells from control, Smo−/− or SmoM2 mice were stained
and analysed for the KLSF cells12, and 500 control or Smo−/− KLSF cells were injected along
with 200,000 competing bone marrow cells into lethally irradiated CD45.1 recipients.
Multilineage repopulation was assessed at 20 weeks. Secondary repopulation assays were
carried out by isolating whole bone marrow from primary recipients originally transplanted
with control or Smo−/− KLSF cells. Recipient mice were killed and analysed for donor
chimaerism at 24 weeks.

Generation and analysis of diseased mice
HSCs from Smo−/−, SmoM2 or control mice were isolated and cultured overnight in X-vivo
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 ng ml−1 stem cell factor (SCF, also known as KITLG)
and 20 ng ml−1 thrombopoietin (THPO) in a 96-well U-bottom plate (50,000 per well).
Subsequently, cells were infected with MSCV-BCR-ABL1-IRES-GFP or MSCV-IRES-GFP
as a control. After 48 h, different cell doses ranging from 15,000–20,000 Smo−/− or 5,000–
8,000 limiting SmoM2 cells were transplanted retro-orbitally along with 200,000 whole bone
marrow cells into lethally irradiated allelically mismatched recipients. After transplantation,
recipient mice were evaluated daily for signs of morbidity, weight loss, failure to groom and
splenomegaly. Premorbid animals were killed and relevant tissues were collected and analysed
by flow cytometry and histopathology. For flow cytometric analysis of CML stem cells,
leukaemic cells were stained for KLS and analysed on FACS-Vantage (BD Biosciences) and
Flowjo software (Tree Star, Inc.).

Cyclopamine treatment of diseased mice
Mice were given 25 mg kg−1 of cyclopamine twice a day by oral gavage beginning 6–8 days
after transplantation. Treatment was continued for five consecutive days, stopped for two days,
and then continued once a day until the end of the monitoring period. Mice were visually
assessed daily for signs of distress. In mice that showed signs of distress treatment was stopped
and continued when they showed recovery.

Methylcellulose colony formation assays
For the colony formation assays CML KLS GFP+ cells, or KLSF cells infected with wild-type
BCR–ABL1 or T315I BCR–ABL1 were sorted into a 24-well plate with complete
methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell Technologies) containing cyclopamine (Toronto Research
Chemicals) and/or imatinib (Seqouia Research Chemicals). Colonies were counted 8–10 days

after plating. For the serial replating assay, cells were collected and counted, and 10,000 cells
were replated into 12-well plates.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunofluorescence staining
Primary CML cells collected from bone marrow and spleen were sorted for KLS and GFP+
cells by FACS. Cells were cytospun, airdried and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The primary
antibody used was goat anti-Numb (Novus Biologicals), and the secondary antibody used was
donkey anti-goat-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes). DAPI (Molecular Probes) was added
as a nuclear counterstain. Slides were viewed on the Axio Imager (Zeiss) at ×630 magnification.
Fluorescence intensity analysis was quantified using Metamorph software (Molecular
Devices).

Real-time PCR analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RNA was isolated using RNAqueous-Micro (Ambion) and converted to cDNA using
Superscript II (Invitrogen). cDNA concentrations were measured with a fluorometer (Turner
Designs) using RiboGreen reagent (Molecular Probes). Quantitative rtPCR was performed
using an iCycler (BioRad) by mixing equal amounts of cDNAs, iQ SYBR Green Supermix
(BioRad) and gene specific primers. Primer sequences are available on request. All real-time
data was normalized to actin.

Human CML samples
All experiments on human CML samples were carried out with approval from the Duke
University Institutional Review Board. Patient samples were either obtained from the Duke
Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Clinic, or purchased from Open Biosystems. Mononuclear
cells were isolated from peripheral blood samples using density-gradient centrifugation. RNA
was isolated using RNAqueous-Micro (Ambion) and was converted to cDNA using Superscript
II (Invitrogen). PCR with reverse transcription (RT–PCR) was performed (DNA Engine
DYAD) with primer sequences specific to human SMO. Primer sequences are available on
request. For all colony formation assays, samples were sorted for hCD34+ cells and plated into
a 12-well plate (100,000 cells per well) with complete methylcellulose medium (Stem Cell
Technologies) in the presence of tomatidine or cyclopamine (1 μM, Toronto Research
Chemicals). Colony numbers were counted 14–17 days after plating.

a, Analysis of YFP fluorescence, which reflects SmoM2 expression in control (con) and
SmoM2 KLSF cells (n = 4). b, Analysis of CML stem cells (GFP+ KLS) in mice transplanted
with BCR–ABL1-infected control (left) and constitutively activated Smo (SmoM2, right)
KLSF cells. c, The average percentage of CML stem cells in mice receiving BCR–ABL1transduced control (n = 4) and SmoM2 KLSF cells (n = 12). Error bars are s.e.m., *P = 0.048.
d, rtPCR analysis of SmoM2 expression in CML stem cells. e, Survival curve of mice receiving
BCR–ABL1 transduced control (solid line) or SmoM2 KLSF cells (dashed line; n = 2, 16 mice,

Figure 3. Loss of Smo increases frequency of cells with high levels of Numb and contributes to
decreased CML growth

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

a, CML stem cells from Smo+/+ and Smo−/− leukaemias were stained with Numb (red, top
panel) and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue, bottom panel). Scale bar, 10 μM. b,
The average fluorescence intensity (AFI) was determined by dividing the overall mean
fluorescence intensity by the area of the cell (P = 0.002). c, The frequency of cells with high
expression levels of Numb was calculated by designating cells above a mean fluorescence
intensity value of 1,000 as high expressors (n = 3, using either CML KLS or CML c-Kit+ cells).
d, KLSF cells were infected with MSCV-BCR-ABL1-IRES-GFP and either vector MSCVIRES-YFP or MSCV-Numb-IRES-YFP. GFP and YFP double-positive cells were plated in
methylcellulose, colonies were counted and cells were serially replated (n = 2, *P < 0.006). e,
CML KLS cells were infected with viruses expressing control vector or Numb IRES-YFP.
Infected cells were sorted and plated in methylcellulose (n = 2, P = 0.03). Error bars in b–e are
s.e.m.

Figure 4. Pharmacological inhibition of Smo impairs CML development and propagation

a, CML stem cells were plated in methylcellulose in the presence of 1 μM tomatidine (control)
or cyclopamine (n = 2, *P = 0.005). b, Survival curve of mice transplanted with BCR–ABL1infected KLS cells in the presence of vehicle or cyclopamine (n = 3 with 32 mice, P = 0.02).
c, Representative example of CML stem-cell frequency in vehicle- or cyclopamine-treated
CML. d, Average CML stem cell frequency in vehicle-or cyclopamine-treated mice (n = 4,
*P = 0.03). e, KLSF cells were infected with wild-type BCR–ABL1 or the imatinib-resistant
T315I mutant BCR–ABL1, and plated in methylcellulose with imatinib (2 μM) or cyclopamine
(1 μM) (n = 2, *P < 0.004). f, Survival curve of mice receiving T3151 BCR–ABL1-infected
KLSF cells and either vehicle or cyclopamine, 7 days after transplantation (n = 2 with 16 mice,
P = 0.021). g, SMO PCR on primary uncultured human CML samples. h, Imatinib-resistant
K562 blast crisis CML cells were plated in methycellulose in the presence of 1 μM tomatidine
or cyclopamine (n = 2, *P < 0.01). i, CD34+ cells were sorted from primary uncultured human
