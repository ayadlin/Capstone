Background: Racial disparity in the incidence of multiple myeloma is well established; however, to the authors’ knowledge, little is
known regarding the impact of racial differences on disease characteristics, response to therapy, and clinical outcome. Methods: The
authors studied 453 patients (174 of whom were black and 279 of whom were white) who underwent transplant between 2000 and
2013. The median follow-up was 4.4 years. Results: Black patients were significantly younger than white patients (median age, 54
years vs 59 years; P<.0001), more frequently presented with anemia (P 5 .04), had more of the immunoglobulin G isotype (P<.001),
and had a borderline favorable cytogenetic risk (P 5 .06). Overall response to induction was similar, but deeper responses were
observed in more white patients compared with black patients receiving immunomodulatory drug-based induction (P 5 .02). Referral
for transplant was significantly delayed in black individuals (median, 1.3 years vs 0.9 years; P 5 .003). Overall survival from the time
of transplant was similar for black and white patients, with medians of 6.2 years and 5.7 years, respectively, but survival from the time
of diagnosis was significantly longer among black individuals (median, 7.7 years vs 6.1 years; P 5 .03). Maintenance therapy was found
to positively impact progression-free survival but not overall survival, irrespective of race. Conclusions: The results of the current
study confirm ethnic differences in age, referral patterns, response to therapy, and overall survival. Future validation of these disparC 2014 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a plasma cell malignancy characterized by the proliferation of clonal plasma cells in the bone
marrow and the production of monoclonal immunoglobulin and/or light chain with subsequent end-organ damage.1 In
2013, MM accounted for 1.3% of all malignancies reported in the United States.2 The annual incidence is approximately
24,050 cases, with a mortality of 11,090 individuals yearly. The incidence is 2-fold to 3-fold higher in blacks compared
with other racial/ethnic groups.3
It is now accepted that MM is universally preceded by monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS).4,5 A recent study of >12,000 individuals in the United States demonstrated that MGUS is more common in
blacks compared with whites (3.7% vs 2.3%; P<001). In addition, black individuals more often have features associated
with a higher risk of progression to MM.6 Many explanations for the racial/ethnic difference in the incidence of MGUS/
MM have been proposed. Socioeconomic data have indicated that the risk of MM was significantly higher in the lowest
categories of occupation, education, and income.7 Differences in lifestyle and dietary habits as well as the higher frequency
of obesity among black individuals may partly explain this disparity.8,9 A recent study suggested a link between MGUS/
MM and chronic immune stimulation due to autoimmune diseases, acquired infections, and inflammatory conditions.10,11 Other studies have linked specific human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) (HLA-Bw65, HLA-Cw5, and HLADRw14) to MM.12-15 Recently, hyperphosphorylated paratarg-7, a defined autosomal dominantly inherited risk factor
for MGUS and MM, was found in 11 of 100 African American (11.0%), 8 of 550 European (1.5%), and 1 of 278 Japanese (0.4%) healthy controls (P<.001), suggesting a genetic predisposition in black individuals.16 Aggregation of MM in
black families has been observed.17-19

Multiple Myeloma In Black and White/Bhatnagar et al

Although the survival of patients with MM has
improved significantly in the last decade, the increase in
overall survival (OS) was not uniformly observed among
racial/ethnic groups.20,21 Recent studies from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database demonstrated that the cumulative survival benefit over successive
years was greatest for white individuals. The 5-year OS
rate between 1998 and 2009 increased by 116.8% for
whites compared with 114.4% and 15.8% for blacks
and Hispanics, respectively.22 This increase in OS was
mostly noted for patients aged <50 years.23
Several studies that address therapy have shown that
black patients are less likely to receive timely autologous
stem cell transplantation (ASCT) compared with white
patients.24 When black patients are transplanted in a
timely manner, their outcomes are similar to those of
white patients.25,26 To the best of our knowledge, the majority of published reports of novel agents in patients with
MM are focused on non-Hispanic whites, and representation of other racial/ethnic groups is limited.27 When black
patients are present, they often represent <5% of the
study subjects despite comprising >12% of the population in the United States and a significantly higher percentage of patients with MM. The causes for disparity in
access and enrollment in clinical trials may contribute to
the overall clinical outcome. Nevertheless, despite decades
of describing epidemiologic ethnic disparities among
patients with MM, to our knowledge there are no data
regarding disease presentation, cytogenetic risk, and
response to various agents such as immunomodulatory
drugs (IMiDs) and proteasome inhibitors (PIs) to establish whether ethnicity impacts clinical outcomes.
In the current study, we evaluated our experience
with white and black patients with MM who underwent
ASCT over a 13-year period to understand differences in
disease biology (presentation and cytogenetics) and the
impact of novel agents on survival. The current study did
not address disparities in health care access because all
patients evaluated at the study institution had insurance
coverage to proceed to ASCT, thus excluding the impact
of access to ASCT on outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Institutional Review Board of the University of
Maryland approved the study and granted a waiver for
a retrospective chart review. Between January 2000 and
July 2013, 625 patients with MM underwent ASCT at
the University of Maryland: 348 patients (56%) were
white, 239 patients (38%) were black, and 38 patients
(6%) were of other races/ethnicities. Patients were

included in the study if eligibility criteria were met (ie,
racial/ethnic group was either black or white, adequate
documentation of baseline data including disease characteristics at the time of diagnosis, response to induction
therapy, and adequate follow-up). We evaluated initial
disease characteristics including demographics, date of
diagnosis, isotype, and disease status before ASCT. Serum albumin, b2-microglobulin, calcium, hemoglobin,
and platelet counts were also recorded. Radiologic evaluations and cytogenetic data, when available, were
documented, as was the type of induction therapy
administered. Patients with amyloidosis and plasma cell
leukemia were excluded. Data are presented for 174 of
239 black patients (73%) and 279 of 348 white patients
(80%); the difference was not statistically significant.
The main reason for the difference was a lack of
adequate baseline data.
Therapy

Before transplantation, patients received various induction regimens including dexamethasone-based regimens
(vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone), IMiDs
(thalidomide or lenalidomide), IMiDs combined with
chemotherapy (dexamethasone, thalidomide, and 4-day
continuous infusion of cisplatin, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide [DT-PACE]), the proteasome inhibitor (PI) bortezomib, or combinations including
IMiDs and a PI (such as bortezomib, lenalidomide, and
dexamethasone and DT-PACE and bortezomib). Peripheral blood stem cells were collected by leukapheresis after
mobilization with cyclophosphamide and granulocytecolony-stimulating factor. Conditioning regimens
included melphalan at a dose of 200 mg/m2 with dose
reduction to 140 mg/m2 for patients aged >70 years and
those with renal insufficiency (creatinine >2 mg/dL).
IMiD maintenance therapy was administered at the discretion of the treating physician. Clinical response was
classified according to the International Working Group
uniform response criteria.
Statistical Analysis

Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of
black patients and white patients were compared using
the general linear model approach for continuous variables. The distribution of categorical variables such as sex,
disease specifics, International Staging System, type of
maintenance therapy, and responses before and after
ASCT was compared between the 2 groups using the
Fisher exact test or test for R3C contingency tables with
the Monte-Carlo method to estimate the true P value. OS

was defined as the time from ASCT to death from any
cause or censored at the time of last contact. Progressionfree survival (PFS) was measured from the date of ASCT
to the first of any event, including disease recurrence or
death from any cause (whichever came first), or censored
at the time of last contact. OS and PFS distributions were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the results are
presented summarized as the median OS and the median
PFS with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs). Survival from diagnosis was defined as the
time from diagnosis to death from any cause or censored
at the time of last contact. A univariate and a stepwise
multivariable Cox regression model was used to assess
whether sex, ethnicity, age, disease specifics, stage of disease as defined by the International Staging System,
induction therapy, time from diagnosis to ASCT, and
response to induction impact patients’ survival outcomes.
Modeling options were limited by the number of events.
An ordinary logistic regression model was applied to assess
whether induction therapy had an impact on patients’
response to treatment. The probability or odds to achieve
a very good partial response (VGPR) or complete
response (CR) was modeled with 2 plausible predictors,
race and induction type, as well as their interaction.
1066

OS and PFS parameters were estimated for patients
with and without maintenance therapy separately. The
model was based on univariate Cox regression findings.
Testing was performed at a significance level of .05. All
reported P values are 2-sided. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. The analyses were performed
using SAS Systems for Windows (version 9.31; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Disease Presentation

Patient demographics and clinical characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Black patients presented at a younger
age when compared with white patients (median age, 54
years vs 59 years; P<.001). At the study institution, more
black women than men underwent ASCT (P<.001), most
likely reflecting referral patterns and compliance, because it
is well established that black men have the highest incidence of MM. At the time of presentation, black patients
were found to have significantly more frequent anemia
(P 5 .04) and more IgG and fewer IgA isotypes (72% vs
57% and 11% vs 25%, respectively; P 5 .001) than white
patients. It is interesting to note that black patients had a

trend toward more frequent hyperdiploid karyotypes compared with white individuals (22 vs 13%; P 5 .06).
Induction Therapy

The overall distribution of induction therapy is outlined
in Table 2. The majority of induction regimens were
delivered in the community before referral for ASCT.
Most patients (334 patients) received novel agents for
induction. There was no difference noted with regard to
the distribution of induction regimens between black and
white patients (P 5 .15). Novel agents (IMiDs and PIs)
were found to improve patient responses, with more frequent VGPRs, near-CRs, or CRs noted compared with
chemotherapy alone (P<.0001). The impact of PIs was
found to be independent of race (odds ratios, 3.7 and 3.8;
P 5 .0005 and .01 for white and black patients, respectively). Conversely, the benefit of induction with IMiDs,
especially when combined with PIs, was more evident in
white patients (odds ratio, 2.3 years vs 1.5 years for white
and black patients; P 5 .03 and .4, respectively) (Table
3). Depth of response as defined by responses of at least
VGPR were observed more frequently in white versus
black patients (30% vs 13%, respectively; P 5 .02).
PFS and OS

Referral for ASCT after induction was significantly
delayed in black patients compared with white patients
(1.3 years [6 1.5 years standard deviation] vs 0.9 years
[61.0 standard deviation]; P 5.003). The median
follow-up from the date of ASCT was 4.4 years (95% CI,
3.9 years-5.1 years) and was practically identical for black
and white patients. Overall PFS was similar for black
patients at 1.9 years (95% CI, 1.5 years-2.6 years) and
white patients at 1.9 years (95% CI, 1.7 years-2.3 years)
(Figure 1A). The median OS was 6.2 years (95% CI, 4.2

years-7.8 years) for black patients, and it was 5.7 years
(95% CI, 4.5 years-6.8 years) for white patients (P 5.18)
(Figure 1B).
Maintenance therapy was given to 337 patients
(74%) with equal distribution between black (130 patients:
75%) and white (207 patients: 74%) patients. Maintenance therapy was found to positively affect PFS; the median PFS was 2.6 years (95% CI, 1.9 years-3.1 years) and
2.4 years (95% CI, 1.9 years-2.9 years) for black and white
patients, respectively. The OS was not different between
the 2 racial groups for those who received maintenance
therapy; the median OS for black patients was 6.7 years
(95% CI, 4.9 years-10.2 years) and was 5.9 years for white
patients (95% CI, 4.7 years-7.5 years). There was no difference in PFS noted between white and black patients who
did not receive maintenance therapy (median, 1 year for
both). OS was nearly the same for those who did not receive
maintenance therapy irrespective of race at 4 years for black
individuals (95% CI, 3.1 years-6.8 years) and 3.7 years for
white individuals (95% CI, 2.3 years-6.3 years) Figure 2. It
is interesting to note that the time to death from diagnosis
was significantly longer in black patients versus white
patients (7.7 years [95% CI, 6.5 years-8.8 years] vs 6.1
years [95% CI, 5.2 years-7.2 years]; P 5 .03), thereby
reflecting a significant delay in referral to ASCT and equal
OS after ASCT. Multivariate Cox regression modeling for
OS hazard of death was 2-fold higher in white patients versus black patients who did not receive maintenance therapy
(P 5 .027), indicating the significant impact of IMiDs
among white individuals. For patients who received maintenance therapy, OS was found to be significantly affected
by adverse cytogenetic risk (P 5 .005).
DISCUSSION
Black patients fare worse than white patients across a spectrum of diseases including diabetes, heart disease, and several malignancies.28 Black individuals are more likely to
1067

Original Article

be diagnosed at a later stage of disease and are often
offered less aggressive treatment. These disparities reflect
the social injustice that contributes to otherwise preventable suffering. Current research focuses on the harmful
aspects of this inequity. The biological differences that are
contributing to disease processes and in some cases
improved outcomes get much less attention.29
The incidence of MM is 2 to 3 times higher in black
individuals than in whites, but to the best of our knowledge
there are little data to explain the biological causes of the
observed higher incidence and, more importantly, no data
exist regarding the clinical presentation and treatment outcomes of black patients with MM in the era of novel
agents.30,31 In the current study, we focused on evaluating
several aspects of disparities and biological differences
between black and white patients with MM. It is worth
emphasizing that the current study was not a crosssectional community study, but rather a single-institution
analysis with patients referred for ASCT as a common trait.
In the current study, we noticed a significantly longer time from diagnosis of MM to referral to ASCT for
black patients. The disparity is particularly disturbing in
view of the finding that black individuals are on average
aged 5 years younger than white individuals at the time of
diagnosis.3 This longer time from diagnosis to ASCT was
not found to be related to the type of induction, which
was identical in black and white individuals, nor to the
availability of medical insurance, because all patients in
the current study had coverage for ASCT evaluation.
Thus, the delay in receiving ASCT either reflects a failure
of the primary oncologist to refer patients or the reluctance of patients to undergo ASCT.25 It is quite interesting to note that more women underwent ASCT at the
study institution when considering the higher rate of MM
in black men, a phenomenon that has been previously
reported in our institutional study of patients with leukemia.32 Overall, the delay in the referral of black patients
with MM for ASCT reflects a complex interaction
between socioeconomic factors, patient attitudinal factors, and quality of care in an underserved population.33
Is MM in black individuals a biologically different
disease?34 Early reports suggested a more aggressive presentation in black patients, with a higher incidence of fractures, paraplegia, infections, and overall poor prognosis,
all of which were believed to be related to delayed diagnosis.35-37 We found that black individuals appeared to fare
better than white individuals in terms of survival from the
time of diagnosis when equivalent therapy was applied,
even if therapy was delayed, as was the case in the patients
in the current study with ASCT. There are several possible
1068

explanations for this finding. The first is age, because
younger age clearly had a positive impact on OS in
patients with MM.23 However, age alone is not enough to
explain the outcomes, and on multivariate analysis, age
was not found to be a factor. In several epidemiologic
studies, black patients were noted to have different laboratory findings compared with white patients, particularly in
the MGUS stage.6,38,39 This was clearly noted in the current study, because black patients more frequently had the
IgG isotype compared with white patients. The biological
basis for such variation remains unclear.38,40 The noted
differences in anemia in black patients could be the result
of known physiologic differences in the normal lower hemoglobin levels in blacks compared with whites. In addition, there was a higher percentage of women in the
subset of black patients.41 At the molecular level, a recent
study demonstrated a lower frequency of IgH translocations in black patients compared with white patients
(40% vs 52%, respectively; P 5 .032).14 In the current
study, hyperdiploid karyotypes were observed more frequently in black patients, further supporting that molecular differences between racial/ethnic groups might partially
explain clinical outcomes among these different groups.
More data to confirm this finding are needed because
fewer black patients have initial cytogenetics compared
with white patients (45% vs 62%).
The recent significant improvement in OS noted
among white patients over time has not been noted
among black patients, and may be a reflection of unequal
access and/or disparate responsiveness to novel therapies.23 Racial disparity remains a factor in the choice of
therapy, with black individuals less likely to receive novel
agents on clinical trials or to undergo ASCT.21 To the
best of our knowledge, the impact of novel agents and
ASCT in black patients has never been validated in prospective studies. Few small studies from single institutions
have demonstrated equal outcomes for black and white
patients after ASCT. Moreover, the majority of studies of
novel agents have had few black patients, if any. Low
enrollment of black patients in clinical trials has also been
noted in other diseases and the reasons are well described
in several reviews.42 In the population studied herein (in
which all patients received ASCT), we were unable to
address access to care and thus focused on the assessment
of outcome to various therapies. As has been reported by
several groups, PI-based induction regimens were found
to have the greatest impact on response before ASCT, independent of race/ethnicity.43 Conversely, deep responses
(VGPR) to IMiD induction were significantly less frequent in black patients compared with white patients, as

was previously suspected.3 It is also worth noting that
IMiD maintenance therapy had a significant impact on
the survival of white patients with MM, who had twice
the risk of dying compared with black patients in the absence of IMiD maintenance therapy. To our knowledge,
the current study is the first report of inferior responses to
IMiDs in a racial/ethnic group, which may help to explain
why the improvement noted in OS in recent years has
been less pronounced for black patients. Taken together,
the data from the current study suggest that there are inherent biological differences that may affect clinical
response in MM between black and white individuals.
However, these results need to be validated further in
larger prospective cohorts.
In summary, differences exist between black and
white patients with MM. Black patients have a higher
incidence and younger age at the time of presentation.
Clinically, they have more IgG isotypes and more hyperdiploidy, suggesting a less aggressive disease and better
OS. The response of black patients to IMiDs appears to
be inferior compared with what is noted in whites, both

in the induction and maintenance phases. The disparity
noted in the delayed referral of black patients is a concern
and of similar concern is the lower enrollment of black
patients on clinical trials. More research is needed to better understand the factors involved in these experiences
and to identify measures of intervention that will improve
access and participation. These are compelling data to
suggest a biologically different disease process in black
individuals that needs further clarification with microarray
analysis, pharmacogenomics, and genetic profiling. Future
studies should be focused on identifying molecular targets
specific to racial/ethnic groups to make individualized
therapy a reality.
