for hypogonadism after treatment for early, localized prostate cancer. The objective of this study was to assess the risk of biochemical failure with TRT after
treatment of early prostate cancer with permanent transperineal brachytherapy
with or without external beam therapy in patients with low serum levels of testosterone and clinical symptoms of hypogonadism.

METHODS. Patients who underwent prostate brachytherapy from 1996 to 2004
and received subsequent TRT for symptomatic hypogonadism were reviewed to
detail cancer characteristics and treatment as well as pre- and post-TRT serum
testosterone and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values.

RESULTS. Thirty-one men received TRT after prostate brachytherapy for 0.5 to 8.5
years (median, 4.5 years), with a follow-up that ranged from 1.5 years to 9.0 years
(median, 5.0 years) postbrachytherapy. TRT was started from 0.5 years to 4.5
years (median, 2.0 years) after brachytherapy. Serum total testosterone levels ranged from 30 ng/dL to 255 ng/dL (median, 188 ng/dL) before TRT and rose to 365
ng/dL to 1373 ng/dL (median, 498 ng/dL) on TRT. Transient rises in PSA were
observed in 1 patient. The most recent PSA level was <0.1 ng/mL in 23 patients
(74.2%), <0.5 ng/mL in 30 patients (96.7%), and <1 ng/mL in 31 patients (100%).
No patients stopped TRT because of cancer recurrence or documented cancer
progression.

CONCLUSIONS. For patients with low serum testosterone levels and symptoms of
hypogonadism, TRT may be used with caution and close follow-up after prostate
brachytherapy. Cancer 2007;109:536–41.  2006 American Cancer Society.

ince the pioneering and Nobel Prize-winning studies of Huggins
and Hodges nearly 60 years ago, the link between testosterone
and prostate cancer has been detailed extensively.1 Androgen blockade, whether surgical or medical, in many forms, is the mainstay of
treatment of advanced prostate cancer for palliative purposes, with
significant side effects.2
Among American males, testosterone deficiency is common yet
often is insidious in onset. The incidence of hypogonadism increases
with age, although it is diagnosed increasingly in younger men
because of growing physician and patient awareness and increased
testing of serum testosterone levels.3 Increased knowledge of the role
of testosterone in normal male metabolic processes, as well as the

derangements associated with endogenous hypogonadism, makes treatment of this condition appropriate in some patients.
Although there is controversy regarding the benefits and risks of testosterone replacement therapy
(TRT) in males who are not believed to have prostate
cancer, there is even more controversy over the potential of TRT in males who have received previous treatment for prostate cancer.4,5 Whereas many men with
hypogonadism and prostate cancer are not symptomatic, some who are symptomatic may desire TRT.
However, hypogonadal men who have undergone
potentially curative and successful treatment for localized prostate cancer face a conundrum regarding
potential TRT. Men with normal testosterone levels
are not castrated if they have no evidence of disease
after radical surgery or irradiation. Yet, TRT after prostatectomy is considered controversial at best and contraindicated by some. TRT after brachytherapy, with
the prostate still in vivo, may be more angst provoking. Unfortunately, there is a paucity of data regarding
TRT in men who receive previous treatment for prostate cancer, limited to 2 published reports totaling 17
patients with median follow-up of 2 years after radical
prostatectomy.4,5 A literature review reveals that no
reports of TRT after brachytherapy exist.
To assess the risk of biochemical failure or prostate cancer recurrence in patients who undergo TRT
after prostate brachytherapy, a large, single urologic
oncologist’s experience was reviewed. Herein, I report
a large series of TRT in men after treatment for prostate cancer using brachytherapy and with more extensive follow-up.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from men who underwent transperineal, lowdose-rate, permanent brachytherapy or seed implantation for early-stage prostate cancer by a single urologic oncologist from July 1996 to December 2004
were reviewed from a prospectively maintained database. Assessment included disease characteristics
and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value at
diagnosis, length of follow-up, and all subsequent
PSA values. Cancer treatment-related details were
noted, including whether brachytherapy was used
alone or in combination with external beam therapy
and whether or not patients received temporary adjuvant androgen blockade. When the latter was used,
it was accomplished with lutenizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist (leuprolide acetate or
goserelin) either alone or in combination with nonsteroidal antiandrogen (bicalutamide) for a maximum of 12 months.

537

TRT was initiated 6 months from the time of
implantation after it was confirmed that the total serum testosterone level was <300 ng/dL on repeated
morning assays in combination with symptoms of
hot flashes, severe anergy, depression, fatigue, and
erectile dysfunction and/or decreased libido. TRT
was continued only in men who manifested a beneficial clinical response. The choice of pharmacologic
agent for TRT was left to each individual patient,
although most patients initially received injections
(testosterone cyprionate 200 mg) to avoid issues of
variable absorption of transdermal products. Subsequently, patients were switched to other compounds
according to their preference.
All patients were staged according to the TNM
classification system.6 Informed verbal discussion
and consent was documented in all patients. Followup consisted of semiannual visits for 5 years after
implantation and annual visits thereafter. At each
visit, patients underwent physical examination and
measurement of serum PSA and total testosterone.
Prior to June 2004, all PSA and testosterone assays
were done at commercial or hospital laboratories; after that, a point-of-care, in-office assay (Qualigen)
was used for most determinations. Assessment did
not include measurements of free testosterone or
sex-binding globulin, routine complete blood counts,
calculation of body mass index, or standardized, validated quality-of-life (QOL) measures.

RESULTS
Thirty-six of 715 men (5.0%) who were treated consecutively between July 1996 and December 2004 have
received or are receiving TRT after brachytherapy.
Five patients received from 1 to 3 months of TRT,
which was stopped after they achieved no perceived
symptomatic benefit, not because of any rise in PSA,
because PSA was not measured during that short
interval, and those men did not demonstrate any
subsequent rises in PSA. Thirty-one patients have
received or are receiving long-term TRT and form the
basis of this analysis.
Men ranged in age from 51 years to 79 years
(median, 65 years) at the time of brachytherapy. The
prostate cancer disease characteristics at the time of
diagnosis and treatments are detailed in Table 1. The
median serum PSA level was 5.3 ng/mL, the single
most common Gleason score was 6 in 19 of 31 men
(61.3%), and the most frequent clinical stage was T1c
in 20 of 31 men (64.5%). Twenty patients underwent
brachytherapy implantation alone, and the remaining
11 patients underwent brachytherapy implantation
combined with external-beam radiotherapy. Tran-

sient androgen blockade for shrinkage or for highrisk disease was received for 8 to 12 months by 14
patients. The preblockade serum testosterone level
was available in only 3 patients and was <300 ng/dL
in all 3. Whether or not the other 11 patients failed
to recover or had endogenously low testosterone
levels prior to blockade is unknown.
TRT was initiated from 0.5 years to 4.25 years
(median, 2.0 years) after brachytherapy; and, in the
14 men who had received transient androgen blockade, TRT was initiated from 0.5 years to 3.0 years
(median, 2.0 years) after the LHRH agonist had been
stopped. Pre-TRT serum testosterone levels ranged
from 30 ng/dL to 255 ng/dL (median, 188 ng/dL)
(Table 2). The duration of TRT in all 31 patients ranged from 0.5 years to 8.5 years (median, 4.5 years).
The maximal serum testosterone level on TRT ranged
from 356 ng/dL to 1373 ng/dL (median, 498 ng/dL).
Follow-up after brachytherapy implantation ranged
from 1.5 years to 9.0 years (median, 5.0 years).
PSA values have declined steadily from the time
of implantation, and only 3 patients have had a transient PSA rise or bounce that already had resumed a
declining course prior to initiation of TRT. Only 1
patient has had any rises in PSA after TRT, followed
by declines. The most recent serum PSA levels were
<0.1 ng/mL in 23 patients (74.2%), <0.5 ng/mL in 30
patients (96.7%), and <1.0 ng/mL in all 31 patients
(100%) (Table 3). All 7 patients with PSA levels between 0.1 ng/mL and 0.5 ng/mL are <3 years post-

implantation, had a steadily declining PSA both
before and after the initiation of TRT, and their most
recent PSA was their nadir since brachytherapy. The
1 patient who had a PSA >0.5 ng/mL is 5 years postimplantation and has not undergone prostatic biopsies
or other studies to exclude recurrence. No patient has
stopped TRT because of a possible or confirmed recurrence or progression of prostate cancer.

DISCUSSION
Prostate cancer is very common, in that nearly
250,000 men are diagnosed annually in the United
States alone, and the majority have early-stage, localized disease.7 Based on the frequency of low testosterone and symptoms of hypogonadism in men with
early prostate cancer and on the high rate of success
with treatment for early prostate cancer, clinicians
frequently may encounter patients with prostate cancer who may seek treatment for relief of those symptoms. The current data appear to indicate that TRT
after brachytherapy treatment for early-stage prostate
cancer may be performed safely in selected and carefully monitored patients.
The cornerstone of TRT after prostate cancer
treatment is the underlying success of the primary
cancer treatment in controlling the cancer. Multiple
series indicate that brachytherapy with or without

Testosterone Replacement in Prostate CA/Sarosdy

external radiation provides a high rate of freedom
from biochemical failure at 5 years and 10 years, at
least equivalent to radical prostatectomy.8–13 In those
reports, biochemical failure is noted in from 10% to
25% of patients by 5 years posttreatment. The high
rate of success in biochemical control of patients in
the current report, despite TRT, appears to be consistent with the rates in patients who undergo
brachytherapy or radical prostatectomy at multiple
centers. It is possible that the current report’s apparent success may reflect small numbers or short follow-up, although 50% of patients have been followed
from 5 years to 9 years postbrachytherapy.
It should be noted that patients who were considered for TRT were not selected after an arbitrary,
lengthy time (eg, 5 years) to avoid administering TRT
to patients who may have demonstrated biochemical
failure to brachytherapy prior to the initiation of
TRT. In addition, the disease characteristics at diagnosis closely reflect the range of early-stage prostate
cancer, and the majority of patients in this study had
stage T1c tumors and a Gleason score of 6; however,
10 patients (32%) had palpable, stage T2 tumors, and
9 patients (29%) had a Gleason score >6.
Unlike after surgery, when PSA should rapidly
drop to undetectable levels, after brachytherapy implantation, it has been well documented that PSA
levels decline in all patients over 24 months to 36
months before a PSA nadir has been reached and
that an upward bounce in the PSA level may occur
during this decline in nearly 25% of patients.9,11,14,15
The observation of a slight bounce in PSA in 3 of 31
patients that was resolving by the time TRT was
initiated in the current series reinforces the approach
of delaying TRT to 18 months after implantation,
so that the bounce phenomenon is not interpreted as
secondary to TRT.
Two reports recently detailed the absence of biochemical recurrence with TRT in smaller numbers of
patients after radical prostatectomy.4,5 The current
report confirms that, with even more substantial follow-up, TRT also may be safe and practical after
brachytherapy for prostate cancer. Although this
report is observational and is not the product of a
randomized clinical trial, the results seem to add
substantially to the current clinical data; and, together, these reports may serve to generate hypothesis-testing, prospective clinical studies.
Much of the concern over the risks of TRT relative to prostate cancer is based on limited published
data and anxiety over the known link between prostate cancer and testosterone.3,16 In the preface to an
Institute of Medicine (IOM) report of the research on
testosterone therapy, the chairman reported that the

539

committee noted a paucity of randomized, controlled
clinical trials, in particular among middle-aged or
older men.17 The IOM committee concluded that a
standardized clinical definition of hypogonadism
does not exist, that clinical data do not clearly support either the efficacy or safety of TRT in older men,
and that small clinical trials designed to define efficacy in older men should be completed and, if positive, followed by larger trials in middle-aged men. In
the meantime, the committee indicated that testosterone therapy is appropriate only for the FDAapproved indication: treatment of hypogonadism.17
That group did not address the issue of TRT in men
who were treated previously for prostate cancer; in
fact, the 2 prior reports on TRT after radical prostatectomy were published after the IOM report.
Investigators generally have skirted the issue of
TRT among patients with prostate cancer and have
approached it obliquely, by reporting other endpoints, such as new prostate cancers detected or
changes in serum PSA while patients without cancer
are on TRT. Gaylis et al. detailed 20 patients who
were diagnosed with prostate cancer while they were
receiving TRT for hypogonadism, but those authors
did not report incidence or compare their findings
with age-matched controls who did not receive
TRT.18 Calof et al., in their meta-analysis of 19 of 417
TRT reports that met their inclusion criteria, failed to
find a significant increase in high PSA levels (>4 ng/
mL), prostate biopsies, or prostate cancer in men
undergoing TRT compared with controls.19 El-Sakka
et al. reported no significant change in PSA levels
with 12 months of TRT in 187 men who were treated
for erectile dysfunction and hypogonadism, whereas
Gerstenbluth et al. did note an increase in mean PSA
levels from 1.86 ng/mL to 2.82 ng/mL in 54 similar
patients without cancer.20,21
Rhoden and Morgentaler studied a group of
patients who they believed were at high risk for prostate cancer because of the histologic findings of highgrade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) on cancer-negative biopsies who subsequently received TRT
for 1 year.22 Those authors did not find a greater rise
in PSA or an increased finding of prostate cancer in
men with PIN compared with men who did not have
PIN on prior biopsy. In addition, in a large review,
Morgentaler cited no increase in the risk of prostate
cancer in clinical trials of TRT, in longitudinal population-based studies, or in similar high-risk patients.23
The long-term benefits of TRT relative to sexual function, mood, body mass, and bone mineral density
have been outlined well by Wang et al.24
It should be noted that the 31 patients on TRT in
the current study represent only 5% of the patients

540

who underwent brachytherapy during the same period, indicating that many more patients with prostate cancer may have low testosterone levels but may
not desire to undergo TRT, even though potential
TRT has been discussed and offered to them. Some
of the reasons for this may be the lack of published
data and the resulting confusion and anxiety and the
lack of perceived guidance. This was stated specifically by 3 of the 5 patients who stopped TRT after
they obtained no or minimal perceived benefit from
a short course of TRT.
It also is worth noting that, although QOL
indices were not measured, the objective of TRT in
these patients was relief of hypogonadal symptoms,
not simply restoration of testosterone to higher
levels. In the early years, this was largely in response
to patient insistence and was agreed to by the author
with some trepidation. The observation that 31 of 36
patients (86.1%) who received any TRT have continued it for a median of 4.5 years and for as long as
8.5 years is clear testimony to the improved QOL
experienced by these patients.
Clearly, most patients who have failed on treatment for early-stage prostate cancer in virtually all
previous reports have done so without TRT, and
patients on TRT also can be expected to fail, depending on the adequacy of their primary cancer treatment and disease stage. It is conjectural whether or
not raising testosterone levels from low to normal
would have any negative impact. Castrate levels of
total serum testosterone <20 ng/dL have been considered the standard in medical castration.25 The
pre-TRT testosterone levels of from 30 ng/dL to 255
ng/dL among the patients in the current report
would not be considered low enough for the purposes of anticancer medical castration. Furthermore,
it has not been demonstrated that such low levels
would not be enough to fuel the recurrence or progression of prostate cancer in the face of less than
adequate primary treatment of the localized cancer.
Finally, there is no question that prospective,
randomized trials would be useful in addressing
more completely the issue of TRT after any treatment
for early-stage, localized prostate cancer. However,
the apparent absence of progression in this report
indicates that a randomized Phase III trial would
require thousands of patients, a very long duration
to reach valid statistical endpoints, and extremely
high costs.
In conclusion, the current report indicates that
TRT may be used with caution and close follow-up
in hypogonadal patients after they receive prostate
brachytherapy for localized, early-stage prostate cancer. Assessment of baseline testosterone should be

considered critical among men with early-stage prostate cancer, especially those who may undergo transient androgen blockade as part of their cancer
treatment.
Blanket statements that TRT is contraindicated
after treatment for early-stage prostate cancer do not
appear to be supported by these data. Given the significant, long-term metabolic derangements and significant symptoms in some hypogonadal patients,
TRT may be considered in select patients who appear
to have been treated successfully for early-stage,
localized prostate cancer.
