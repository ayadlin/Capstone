BACKGROUND: Bile reflux contributes to the development of esophageal injury and neoplasia. The mucin 5AC
(MUC5AC) is absent in the normal squamous epithelium of the esophagus but is strongly expressed in Barrett esophagus (BE). The objective of this study was to determine whether and how bile acids influence the expression of
MUC5AC in the esophagus. METHODS: MUC5AC expression was studied by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting in human tissues, in tissues from a rat model of BE, and in SKGT-4 cultured esophageal epithelial cells. MUC5AC
transcription was studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction and transient transfection assays. RESULTS:
MUC5AC was absent from normal squamous epithelium but was present in 100% of Barrett specimens and in 61.5%
of human esophageal adenocarcinoma tissues that were examined. MUC5AC protein expression was induced to a
greater degree by conjugated bile acids than by unconjugated bile acids, and this occurred at the transcriptional
level. In the rat reflux model, MUC5AC mucin was expressed abundantly in tissues of BE stimulated by duodenoesophageal reflux. Conjugated bile acids induced AKT phosphorylation in SKGT-4 cells but had no effect on extracellular
signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase, or protein-38 kinase phosphorylation. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 and a dominant-negative protein kinase C (AKT) construct prevented
the induction of MUC5AC by conjugated bile acids. Transactivation of AP-1 by conjugated bile acids coincided with
MUC5AC induction, and cotransfection with a dominant-negative activator protein-1 (AP-1) vector decreased
MUC5AC transcription and its induction. CONCLUSIONS: Conjugated bile acids in the bile refluxate contribute to
MUC5AC induction in the esophagus. This occurs at the level of transcription and involves activation of the PI3K/

Esophageal cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death among men in the United States.1 During the past
several decades, the incidence of adenocarcinoma in the esophagus has risen at an alarming rate in western countries and
has exceeded that of squamous cell carcinoma.2,3 Most esophageal adenocarcinomas (EAs) arise from Barrett esophagus,4
a condition in which metaplastic columnar epithelium replaces the normal stratified squamous epithelium.5
Gastroesophageal reflux of acid and bile is the predominant initiating factor in Barrett metaplasia and its progression
to EA.6 Bile reflux is particularly common in individuals with gastroesophageal reflux disease who subsequently develop
Barrett esophagus.7,8 Barrett esophagus also develops secondary to bile reflux in patients who have undergone total gastrectomy.9 Consistent with this observation, Barrett esophagus was followed by EA in a rat model that used esophagojejunostomy to bypass exposure to acid reflux from the stomach.10 In that model, enteroesophageal reflux produced EA in
48% of rats in the absence of exposure to any exogenous carcinogen.11 The precise mechanisms by which duodenal reflux
causes esophageal injury, leads to metaplasia, and predisposes to EA are uncertain.

Mucin Expression in the Esophagus/Song et al

Mucins are large, heavily glycosylated proteins
located at the surface of many epithelia and play an important role in protecting epithelial cells.12 In normal
esophageal tissue, secreted mucins protect the mucosa
against potential injuries, such as the reflux of gastroduodenal contents, including acid and bile.4 Mucin genes are
expressed in a site-specific manner throughout the gastrointestinal tract. In the normal esophagus, MUC1 and
MUC4 are the main mucin genes expressed in the stratified squamous epithelium, whereas MUC5B is expressed
in the submucosal glands.13 The MUC5AC gene is
expressed in the stomach and in tracheobronchial cells but
not in the normal esophagus.13,14 De novo expression of
the MUC5AC gene and the MUC2 gene (an intestinal
mucin) has been observed in Barrett esophagus.13,15-17
The associated risk factors, the mechanisms that control
the expression of MUC5AC mucin in Barrett esophagus,
and the pathologic significance of this mucin in Barrett
columnar epithelium are not clearly understood.
We hypothesized that bile acids in the gastroesophageal refluxate contribute to the formation of Barrett phenotype, including the ectopic expression of MUC5AC
mucin. We sought to determine which bile acids are responsible for MUC5AC expression and the molecular
mechanisms involved.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and fetal
bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). LY294002 was purchased
from Calbiochem (San Diego, Calif). Conjugated (glyocholic [GCA], taurocholic [TCA], taurochendodeoxycholic [TCDC], glycochenodeoxycholic [GCDC], and
taurodeoxycholic [TDC]) and unconjugated (chenodeoxycholic [CD] and deoxycholilc [DC]) bile acids were
obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis,
Mo). ECL-chemiluminescence reagents were purchased
from Amersham-Pharmacia (Piscataway, NJ). Total and
phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) antibodies, phosphorylated protein
kinase C (AKT) antibodies, and phosphorylated c-Jun Nterminal kinase (JNK) and protein-38 kinase (P-38) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, Mass). MUC5AC monoclonal antibody (CLH2
clone) was obtained from Novocastra Laboratories Ltd.
(Newcastle, United Kingdom). Mouse anti-MUC5AC
antibody (clone SPM488) for rat tissues was obtained

from Spring Bioscience (Fremont, Calif). MUC5AC polyclonal antibody HO8 was a gift from Dr. Christopher
M. Evans at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson
Cancer Center (MDACC).

Cell Culture
Human SKGT-4 EA cells derived from well differentiated
adenocarcinoma arising in Barrett esophagus18 were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 lL/mL streptomycin at
37 C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5%
CO2. Treatments with vehicle (0.1% ethanol) or bile
acids were performed in 0.5% FBS. Cytotoxicity was
assessed by cell numbers, Trypan blue exclusion, and the
3-(4,5-dimethiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Promega, Madison, Wis). For the
Trypan blue analysis, after treatment with bile acids for
16 hours, cells were mixed 1:1 with 0.4% Trypan blue
and examined for dye exclusion.

Protein Isolation and Immunoblot Analysis
Cells were lysed in buffer that contained 30 mM TrisHCl, pH 6.8; 150 mM NaCl; 2 mM ethylenediamine
tetraacetic acid; 100 mM NaF; 10 mM sodium pyrophosphate; 2 mM orthovanadate; 1% Triton X-100; 1%
NP-40; 0.2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 1
minitablet protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics Corp., Indianapolis, Ind). Protein concentration of
the supernatant was determined using the BCA protein
assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, Ill). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis on either 3% to
8% Tris-acetate gradient gels for MUC5AC detection or
10% Tris-glycine gels for the detection of other proteins. After gel electrophoresis and transfer to nitrocellulose, the membranes were stained with 0.5% Ponceau S
with 1% acetic acid to confirm equal loading and transfer efficiency. Western blot analyses were performed by
incubating membranes at room temperature for 1 hour
in a blocking solution that contained 5% nonfat dry
milk and 0.1% Tween-20 in Tris-buffered saline (10
mM Tris-HCl with 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.6), probing
with specific primary antibodies, washing with Tris-buffered saline that contained 0.1% Tween 20, and probing
with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase. Immunoreactive bands were observed by
chemiluminescence.

Plasmids, Transient Transfection, and
Luciferase Reporter Assays
A human MUC5AC promoter construct19 that contained
the 3.7-kb MUC5AC 50 -flanking region fused to a luciferase reporter gene was provided by Dr. Ja Seok Koo at
MDACC. Dominant-negative AP-1 (blunted TAM67)20
and the AP-1 promoter-luciferase reporter21 were provided by Dr. Shrikanth A. Reddy and Dr. Jonathan Kurie
(MDACC). The combinational DNA (cDNA) plasmid
for the dominant-negative mutant of AKT (AKT AAA)
was provided by Dr. Dimpy Koul (MDACC).22 Plasmids
were prepared using the Genopure Plasmid Midi Kit
(Roche Diagnostics Corp.). The b-galactosidase expression vector pCH110 (Amersham-Pharmacia, Arlington
Heights, Ill) was used to normalize transfection efficiency.
For transient transfection studies, SKGT-4 cells were
seeded at a concentration of 4  105 cells per well in 6well plates. After overnight culture, cells were transfected
with DNA (1 lg of MUC5AC or AP-1-luciferase reporter
plasmid and 0.2 lg of pCH110) mixed with 3 lL of
FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics Corp.). Cells were then
cultured for an additional 24 hours and harvested for the
measurement of luciferase activity, which was rendered in
relative light unit normalized to b-galactosidase using the
Promega luciferase assay system (Promega) with a TD-20/
20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, Calif). Values shown represent the mean and standard deviation of
the results from at least 3 independent experiments.
Quantitative Real-Time Reverse
Transcriptase-Polymerase Chain Reaction
Analysis of MUC5AC Messenger RNA Level
MUC5AC messenger RNA (mRNA) levels were measured with an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 Sequence
Detection System using the TaqMan Gene Expression
Assays kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif) as
described previously.23 The TaqMan probes and primers
that were used for MUC5AC (assay identification number Hs00873638 mL) were assay-on-demand gene expression products (Applied Biosystems). The human b-actin
gene was used as the endogenous control (Applied Biosystems; Hs99999903-mL). The MUC5AC probe was labeled using the reporter dye FAM, and the b-actin
internal control was labeled with a different reporter dye
(VIC) at the 50 end. A nonfluorescent quencher and the
minor groove binder were linked at the 30 end of the probe
as quenchers. All samples were analyzed in triplicate.
Amplification data were analyzed with Prism Sequence
Detection Software (version 2.1; Applied Biosystems).

For relative quantification, the expression of MUC5AC
was normalized against b-actin and rendered as the ratio
of the expression of each target gene mRNA to the expression of each housekeeping gene mRNA.
Rat Model of Barrett Esophagus
Six-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were purchased
from Harlan (Indianapolis, Ind) and housed under standard laboratory conditions. The Levrat esophagojejunostomy technique was used to induce enteroesophageal
reflux and was performed as previously described.24 The
animal care committee at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minnesota, approved this study.
Rats were killed after 50 weeks. The esophagus was
cut at the level of larynx and 2 mm above the anastomosis
site and was opened longitudinally. The esophagus was
fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 24 hours and then
transferred to 80% ethanol. The fixed esophagus was divided longitudinally into 6 to 8 well oriented tissue slices,
with each slice representing the entire length and full
depth of the esophagus but measuring 1 mm wide. Slices were processed and fixed in paraffin to maintain tissue
orientation for histopathologic analysis.
Histopathologic Analysis and
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue specimens, including 28 samples of normal esophageal epithelium, 34 samples of Barrett esophagus, and 28
samples of EA, were obtained from individuals who
underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy at MDACC
under an institutional review board-approved protocol.
There were paired specimens of normal esophageal epithelium, Barrett esophagus, and EA from 22 individuals.
Patterns of expression also were verified in 6 additional
patients with paired specimens of Barrett esophagus and
adenocarcinoma in and 6 patients with paired specimens
of Barrett esophagus and normal epithelium without adenocarcinoma. Samples were fixed in phosphate-buffered
saline-buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Hematoxylin-and-eosinâ€“stained sections (6 lm) were used
to classify tissue types. Human tissue sections were immunostained with the avidin-biotin-complex method25 using
antibody against MUC5AC apomucin (CLH2, mouse
monoclonal antibody, dilution 1:100). Expression of
MUC5AC was scored using a previously validated, semiquantitative scoring system that takes into account tissue
heterogeneity and is subject to statistical analysis.26
For the rat tissue studies, histopathologic analyses
were carried out on tissues that were sectioned into 6-lm

RESULTS
MUC5AC Mucin Expression in Human
Esophageal Mucosa, Barrett Esophagus,
and EA
To clarify the pattern of MUC5AC expression in normal
human esophageal mucosa, Barrett esophagus, and EA,
we performed immunohistochemistry to detect
MUC5AC apomucin in paired human tissue specimens.

Cancer

June 1, 2011

MUC5AC was not detected in any of the specimens of
normal squamous mucosa (Fig. 1A). In contrast,
MUC5AC was strongly expressed in all 34 specimens of
Barrett esophagus, with an average score of 2.897 (Fig.
1B,C). MUC5AC expression was decreased in almost
two-thirds (61.5%) of EA tissues compared with paired
samples of Barrett esophagus, with an average score of
0.96 (Fig. 1D-F). MUC5AC was expressed extensively on
the surface epithelium in Barrett esophagus but also was
expressed in the deeper parts of glandular structures and
in both columnar nongoblet cells and goblet cells (Fig.
1B,C). MUC5AC was sparsely present in cancer specimens and had a progressive decrease in intensity with
poorer differentiation (Fig. 1E,F).

and because bile reflux is a major risk factor for Barrett
esophagus, we sought to determine whether bile acids and
their conjugates are responsible for the induction of
MUC5AC expression in the esophagus. SKGT-4 cells
were treated with conjugated and unconjugated bile acids
for 16 hours at a concentration of 200 lM, which reportedly is a physiologic concentration in esophageal refluxate.27,28 Cell lysate was prepared, subjected to
electrophoresis, and immunoblotted with a specific antibody (CLH2) against MUC5AC apomucin. MUC5AC

apomucin expression was modified only slightly after
treatment with the unconjugated bile acids CD and DC
(Fig. 2A). However, a strong increase in MUC5AC
expression was observed after treatment with the glycoconjugated or tauroconjugated bile acids GCA, TCA,
TCDC, GCDC, and TDC. To confirm this induction of
MUC5AC expression by conjugated bile acids, cells were
treated with different doses of GCDC and TCA, which
are the predominant bile acids in gastroesophageal refluxate. Both GCDC and TCA caused a dose-dependent

induction of MUC5AC apomucin expression in SKGT-4
cells (Fig. 2B). Immunocytochemical staining for
MUC5AC apomucin in cells that were plated in chamber
slides also confirmed the increase in MUC5AC expression
induced by GCDC and TCA, and this increase likewise
was dose-dependent (Fig. 2C). Bile acid treatment, under
the conditions used, did not induce changes in the morphology of the cells (Fig. 2C) and did not affect cell
viability.
Conjugated Bile Acids Induce MUC5AC
Transcription in Esophageal Epithelial Cells
To determine whether the induction of MUC5AC by
conjugated bile acids occurs at the transcriptional level,
cells were transiently transfected with the human
MUC5AC promoter-luciferase construct. Treatment
with GCDC and TCA at a concentration of 200 lM for
16 hours led to a greater than 2-fold increase in
MUC5AC promoter activity (Fig. 3A). This increase in
transcription of the MUC5AC gene was confirmed by
real-time polymerase chain reaction in SKGT-4 cells that
were treated with GCDC and TCA (Fig. 3B).
Signaling Mechanisms by Which Conjugated
Bile Acids Induce MUC5AC
Previous studies have implicated phosphatidylinositol-3
kinase (PI3K) as important in the bile acid-mediated activation of MUC4 mucin. Therefore, we used phosphorylation-specific antibodies and pharmacologic and genetic
approaches to identify the intracellular signaling pathways
responsible for the induction of MUC5AC expression by
conjugated bile acids. Phosphorylation of AKT was
induced by the conjugated bile acids GCDC and TCA at
a concentration of 200 lM, (corresponding to the induction of MUC5AC expression), whereas no changes in the
phosphorylation of ERK1/2, JNK, or P-38 Occurred
under these conditions (Fig. 4A). Ly294002, a specific inhibitor of PI3K, blocked GCDC-induced or TCAinduced MUC5AC expression at concentrations of 5 lM
and 10 lM, and this reduction was dose-dependent (Fig.
4B). When cDNA plasmid for the dominant-negative
mutant of AKT (AKT AAA) was cotransfected with the
MUC5AC-promoter-luciferase construct into SKGT-4
cells, expression of the dominant-negative mutant of AKT
(AKT AAA) completely blocked the MUC5AC transcription induced by GCDC or TCA (Fig. 4C). This further
suggests that the PI3K-AKT pathway is involved in the
induction of MUC5AC expression by the conjugated bile
acids GCDC and TCA.

Activation of AP-1 Is Required for MUC5AC
Induction by Conjugated Bile Acids
It has been reported that bile acids activate AP-1 and
increase its DNA-binding activity, and the MUC5AC
proximal promoter contains multiple AP-1 binding
sites.29 We and others also have reported that AP-1 is
required for the induction of MUC2 expression by bile
acids in colon cancer cells and for the induction of
MUC5AC expression by tobacco smoke in lung cells.30,31

GCDC and TCA for an additional 16 hours. Dominantnegative AP-1 blocked the induction of MUC5AC transcription induced by GCDC and TCA and also decreased
the basal transcriptional activity of MUC5AC (Fig. 5B).
To further investigate whether AP-1 is a downstream transcription factor of PI3K/AKT responsible for
the regulation of MUC5AC by conjugated bile acids, we
cotransfected an AP-1-luciferase construct with a CMVdriven, AKT dominant-negative construct (AKT AAA)
into SKGT-4 cells. Cells were then treated with 200 lM
GCDC and TCA for an additional 16 hours. The dominant-negative AKT mutant vector completely blocked the
AP-1 activity induced by GCDC and TCA and also
decreased the basal level of AP-1 transcriptional activity
(Fig. 5C). These results demonstrate that AP-1, downstream of PI3K/AKT, is necessary for the induction of
MUC5AC expression by the conjugated bile acids
GCDC and TCA.

treated with 200 lM conjugated bile acids GCDC and TCA for
16 to 24 hours, and immunoblots were performed with antibodies against phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) (S473), phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and
2 (p-ERK1/2), phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (pJNK), phosphorylated protein 38 (p-P38), total AKT, and bactin. (B) SKGT-4 cells were preincubated with LY294002
(LY), a PI3K-specific inhibitor, at concentrations of 5 lM (LY5)
and 10 lM (LY10) for 30 minutes before they were stimulated
with GCDC and TCA at 200 lM for 16 to 24 hours. Results are
based on 3 separate experiments. (C) SKGT-4 cells were
cotransfected with 1 lg human MUC5AC promoter and 1 lg of
dominant AKT (AAA) plus 0.2 mg of the control vector pSV
b-galactosidase (pSV-b-gal) and subsequently challenged
with 200 lM GCDC and TCA. Luciferase reporter activity was
measured after 16 hours. Asterisks indicate P < .001.

Therefore, we postulated that AP-1 plays a role in the
induction of MUC5AC expression by conjugated bile
acids. To assess this possibility, we examined AP-1 luciferase activity in SKGT-4 cells after treatment with the conjugated bile acids GCDC and TCA. Conjugated bile
acids GCDC and TCA caused a dose-dependent increase
in AP-1 activity, which coincided with the induction of
MUC5AC (Fig. 5A). To confirm the role of AP-1 in the
regulation of MUC5AC expression by bile acids, we
cotransfected a MUC5AC promoter construct (3.7 kb),
which contains 2 AP-1 sites, with a cytomegalovirus
(CMV)-driven, dominant-negative AP-1 vector (pCMVTAM67) into SKGT-4 cells and then treated cells with

Expression of MUC5AC Mucin in Barrett
Esophagus of Duodenoesophageal Reflux
Rat Model
Barrett esophagus is an acquired condition that results
from chronic gastroesophageal reflux. It is characterized
by the replacement of the normal squamous epithelium of
the lower esophagus by columnar epithelium and the
ectopic expression of the gastric mucin MUC5AC or the
intestinal mucin MUC2. In a rat model in which duodenoesophageal reflux was induced by the Levrat esophajejunostomy technique, Barrett esophagus occurred over time
in most rats.11 MUC5AC apomucin was expressed abundantly in the cytoplasm and membranes of the epithelial
cells in the Barrett mucosa of these rats but not in the
squamous mucosa at the lower end of the resected esophagus (Fig. 6B). Abundant, mature MUC5AC mucin also
was detected in the lumina of glands using the MUC5AC
HO8 antibody against mature MUC5AC mucin,.(Fig.
6C).

DISCUSSION
Barrett esophagus is defined as a specialized columnar
mucosa that replaces the squamous epithelium of the
esophageal mucosa in response to gastroesophageal reflux.
Ectopic expression of gastric and intestinal mucin genes in
Barrett esophagus has been reported in several studies.13,15,16,32-34 However, little known is known about the
risk factors and molecular mechanisms responsible for
MUC5AC expression in Barrett esophagus and EA. In the

current report, we present evidence that conjugated bile
acids in bile refluxate induce MUC5AC expression in the
esophageal epithelium and that this involves activation of
the PI3K/AKT/AP-1 pathway. MUC5AC mucin also is
expressed abundantly in Barrett esophagus induced in a
rat model of duodenoesophageal reflux. These data demonstrate that bile reflux contributes to the development of
the Barrett phenotype, including the ectopic expression of
MUC5AC in the esophagus.
We systematically examined the pattern of expression of MUC5AC mucin in a large number of paired
human tissues, including paired samples of normal esophagus, Barrett esophagus, and EA. In support of previous
studies,13-16 we observed that MUC5AC was absent from
normal squamous epithelium but was present in 100% of
Barrett specimens, with strong reactivity. In addition, it
was present in 61.5% of human EA tissues; however, in
those tissues, MUC5AC expression was reduced compared

2394

with the expression in paired samples of Barrett mucosa,
and reactivity ranged from faint to medium in intensity.
Epidemiologic evidence strongly suggests that bile
reflux is a risk factor for the development of both Barrett
esophagus and EA.7,35 In a study from our laboratory, we
observed that unconjugated bile acids induced MUC2
expression in colon cancer cells.4,30 Mariette et al4 demonstrated the transcriptional regulation of MUC4 by bile
acids in esophageal cancer cells. In the current study, we
have demonstrated that the conjugated bile acids GCDC,
TCA, GCA, and TDC, which are major components of
bile refluxate in the esophagus, are strong inducers of
MUC5AC apomucin expression in the esophagus and
that this regulation occurs at the transcriptional level.
Furthermore, MUC5AC apomucin and mature MUC5
mucin were expressed in the Barrett mucosa in a rodent
model in which the esophagus was chronically exposed to
duodenoesophageal reflux.

Mucin Expression in the Esophagus/Song et al

It has been demonstrated that MUC5AC expression
is induced by various inflammatory cytokines (eg, interleukin 1 [IL-1], IL-4, IL-9, tumor necrosis factor a [TNFa]) and cigarette smoke and by Haemophilus influenzae
infection in human airway epithelial cells.36-40 Song et
al41 demonstrated that the MUC5AC expression induced
by IL-1 and TNF-a involves ERK/P-38/cAMP response
element-binding (CREB) protein, whereas Gensch et al31
reported that the MUC5AC expression induced by
tobacco smoke requires JNK and AP-1. The transcriptional activation of the murine MUC5AC mucin gene by
TGF-b/SMAD family member 4 (smad4) is potentiated
by SP-1.42 To our knowledge, the current study is the first
to address the mechanisms of MUC5AC mucin regulation by bile reflux in the esophagus. By using phosphorylation-specific antibodies, a genetic mutant construct, and
specific pharmacologic inhibitors, we established for the
first time that conjugated bile acids mediate the up-regulation of MUC5AC mucin mainly by activating the PI3K/
AKT pathway, a finding analogous to that of Mariette et
al regarding the induction of MUC4 production by bile
acids.
To determine the transcription factors downstream
of PI3K/AKT that may be responsible for mediating the
induction of MUC5AC by conjugated bile acids, we
focused on AP-1. AP-1 is an important transcription factor that mediates the expression of multiple genes important in biologic process, including cell growth, apoptosis,
and transformation.43-45 AP-1 acts through binding to
the consensus sequence (TGA[C/G]TCA), and the
MUC5AC proximal promoter harbors multiple potential
AP-1 sites.29,31 Our data indicate that AP-1 transcriptional activity is induced by conjugated bile acids and
coincides with MUC5AC induction. Inhibition of AP-1
through the cotransfection of a dominant-negative AP-1
construct abolished MUC5AC transcriptional activity
and its induction. Furthermore, a dominant-negative
AKT construct blocked not only MUC5AC activity but
also AP-1 activity and its induction by conjugated bile
acids. This further suggests that the MUC5AC induction
by conjugated bile acids involves both PI3K/AKT and
AP-1, although other transcription factors, such as NFjB and Hath-1, also may be involved in MUC5AC upregulation.46,47 Additional studies are needed to further
delineate the precise mechanisms by which conjugated
bile acids induce MUC5AC in the esophagus and other
pathways that may be involved.
Although the current study documents the role of
conjugated bile acids in the induction of MUC5AC in the

esophageal epithelium, it does not examine the possible
functional role of this mucin in the transition from normal epithelium, to Barrett metaplasia, to carcinoma. The
effects of combined bile and acid reflux on mucin expression in the esophagus also merit further study. In addition, the origin of the cell type that expresses MUC5AC
needs to be further delineated. The expression of
MUC5AC in â€˜â€˜multilayered epithelium,â€™â€™48 in which
some cells have mucinous and/or columnar features, has
yet to be examined.
In conclusion, we report here that conjugated bile
acids in the duodenogastroesophageal refluxate are potent
inducers of MUC5AC expression in the esophagus and
that this involves activation of the PI3K/AKT/AP-1 pathway. Alterations in mucin expression are associated with
carcinogenesis in various organs of the gastrointestinal
tract,14 and additional studies are needed to investigate
the pathologic significance of MUC5AC ectopic expression in Barrett esophagus and its relation to the progression to EA. A more detailed understanding of the precise
mechanism by which bile acids induce MUC5AC expression and its pathologic significance in Barrett esophagus
and EA may facilitate the development of chemopreventive strategies aimed at diminishing the risk of EA.
