ABSTRACT
Antiblastic drugs have a high number of potential side-effects. Paradoxically,
according to the National Network of Pharmacovigilance, the number of reported
adverse reactions to these agents is proportionally lower than that registered for non
antiblastic drugs. Critical phenomena such as treatment interruptions and significant
dose reductions within the first two months of use may be indicators of adverse
drug reactions. The aim of the present study was to increase our knowledge of
pharmacovigilance to facilitate the actions taken to improve the risk-benefit profile of
cancer drugs and, consequently, their safety. This retrospective observational survey
was carried out on prescriptions from 1st January 2012 to 31st December 2012.Dose
reductions of more than 10% during the first 90 days of therapy were considered as a
surrogate indicator of an adverse reaction. Dose interruptions during the first 60 days
of therapy were taken into consideration. Of the12,472 patients 1,248 underwent a
dose reduction. The drugs that most often required a dose reduction were paclitaxel
and oxaliplatin (17.4% and 17.3%, respectively), docetaxel (14.8%), carboplatin
(15%), fluorouracil (10.7%) and, among oral medications, capecitabine (6.9%). Of
the 1896 patients treated with the same drugs, 9.7% interrupted treatment. Patients
required a lower dose reduction than that reported by other authors. Around 15%
of cases underwent a 30% dose reduction within three months of starting therapy,
indicating a possible adverse reaction. Constant monitoring of dose prescription
and continuous training of medical and nursing staff are clearly needed to increase
awareness of the importance of reporting adverse events.

INTRODUCTION

setting must be closely monitored. It is essential to keep
track of critical events such as treatment interruptions and
significant dose reductions that occur within the first two
months of treatment.
The aim of the present study were also to identify
and report suspected adverse durg reactions and increase
communication between pharmacist and oncologist
for proper overall management of the drug, since the
pharmacovigilance system.

Pharmacovigilance has been defined by the World
Health Organization (WHO) as “the science and activities
relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and
prevention of adverse effects or any other possible drugrelated problems” [1]. The correct Adverse drug reaction
definition (ADRs) is : reaction noxious and unintended,
to medicinal products used at doses normally used in man
for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or treatment, correction or
modification of physiological functions. Adverse events
are unwanted and usually harmful outcomes. The event
may or may not be related to the treatment, and is not the
same as a side effect or an adverse reaction because it is
not always clear whether the drug has caused the event.
In a meta-analysis conducted from 1966 to 1996 on
a sample of hospitalized patients, Lazarou and colleagues
reported that the overall incidence of serious ADRs was
6.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.2%-8.2%) and that
the incidence of fatal ADRs was 0.32% (95% CI 0.23%0.41%) [2]. They estimated that, in 1994, 2,216,000
hospitalized patients had serious ADRs and 106,000 had
fatal ADRs, making these reactions between the fourth and
sixth leading causes of death.
Antineoplastic agents have a potentially high
number of side-effects. The overall safety profile of cancer
drugs is not known, yet this is an element that allows us to
monitor the patient’s quality of life. For this reason, it is
of vital importance to report adverse events, even if these
are not serious and have already been documented. A good
internal reporting system ensures that all parties involved
responsible are aware of major hazards. Reporting ADRs
is also essential to monitor the progress made in error
prevention [3].
In 2012, around 70,150 expedited adverse reaction
reports were received and processed each month and
subsequently made available for signal detection and
data analysis by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)
and the medicine regulatory authorities of Member
States. Of these, 15% were reports on cancer drugs [4].
Consequently, an Italian study on ADR reporting was
performed by the National Network of Pharmacovigilance
[5] and data on cancer-related ADRs reported in 2011
were extrapolated. 21,473 ADRs equivalent to a signaling
rate of 356 reportsper million inhabitants were received
by the Italian National Network of Pharmacovigilance,
and a total of 300 reports per one million people in the
population was reached and exceeded, 300 being the figure
defined by WHO as the gold standard for an efficient
pharmacovigilance system.
European pharmacovigilance legislation also
considers a lack of treatment efficacy and medication
errors as adverse reactions. Such events are not intrinsic to
the patient or the drug, but are related to the management
of the correlated processes, which can influence the riskbenefit profile. It is clear that such phenomena in a cancer

RESULTS
Of the12,472 patients who received one of the study
drugs from 1st January 2012 to 31st March 2013, 11,596
were treated intravenously and 876 orally. 1197 (10.3%)
patients in the former group underwent a dose reduction
during the first 3months of treatment compared to 51
(5.8%) the latter group. Table 1 shows the percentage of
patients who required a dose reduction with respect to the
entire case series.
The most frequent dose reductions in intravenous
drugs were made in paclitaxeland oxaliplatin (17.4%and
17.3% of patients, respectively), followed by docetaxel
(14.8 %), carboplatin (15%) and fluorouracil (10.7%).
Among orally administered drugs, capecitabine showed
the highest percentage of dose reduction (6.9%). No dose
reductions were required in the 59 patients treated with
lenalidomide.
Of the1896 patients who received one of the study
drugs from 1st January 2012 to 28st February 2012,1575
were treated intravenously and 321 orally. Treatment
interruption due to adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
occurred in133 (8.4%) patients of the intravenous group
and 51 (15.9%) of the oral group. The highest number of
ADRs leading to treatment discontinuation were registered
for ifosfamide (12 ADRs in 35 patients) followed by
doxorubicin (23ADRs in 164 patients), carboplatin (32
ADRs in 300 patients) and paclitacxel (14ADRs in 147
patients) (Table 2).
8.7% of patients discontinued treatment during
adjuvant therapy, 23.7% of whom during first-line
therapy, 13.5% during second-line therapy, 20% during
third-line therapy, 11.1% during fourth-line therapy, and
33.3% during fifth-line therapy. Intravenous medication
was discontinued in 8.4% of cases (133/1575), while oral
medications were discontinued in 15.9% of cases (51/321).
In dose reduction analysis the percentage of patients
treated by intravenous drug was 92.7% and 7,3% with
oral drugs. In discontinuation analysis the percentage of
patients treated by intravenous drug was 83% and 17%
with oral drugs.
A total of 242 ADRs were reported by the 7 centers
in the National Network of Pharmacovigilance (RNF),
representing an increase of 52% compared with the
previous year. The main drugs involved were paclitaxel,
oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, carboplatin, and bevacizumab.

84% of reported events were considered non-serious and
16% serious.

9.4% of patients experienced toxicity ≥ grade 3 protocol
amendment.
In our study, 13.5% of patients who reduced the dose
of chemotherapy within three months of starting treatment
underwent a reduction of more than 30%. Some drugs, e.g.
paclitaxel, were reduced in 21.9% of patients with a higher
dosage of 30%, while anthracyclines were reduced in 20%
of cases with a higher dosage of 30%. As these reductions
occurred in the first three months of treatment, they could
probably be linked to suspected adverse reactions that are
regarded as ADRs.
An interesting issue that could be evaluated in
another study is whether PFS and OS was affected in
patients who underwent a dose reduction of more than
30%.
Our study highlights a very interesting phenomenon
regarding the difference between the interruption of 5-FU
and capecitabine. We observed that patients treated with
capecitabine interrupted treatment much more frequently
than those receiving 5-FU. In fact, capecitabine was
discontinued in 17.1% of cases compared to only 6.3% of

DISCUSSION
The aim of pharmacovigilance is to assess the postmarketing safety of drugs. In oncology, adverse drug
reactions are still underreported. Ten percent of patients
in the underwent dose reduction and 9.7% of patients
interrupted treatment. The reduction of intravenously
drug (10.3%) was almost twofold that oral target (5.8%).
This is because, according to our data, the targeted therapy
drugs are reduced to a smaller percentage compared
to the data obtained from the studies. For example, in a
study of 84 non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated
with erlotinib, the drug was reduced in 21% of cases
experiencing grade 3 or 4 adverse events [6].We treated
108 patients with erlotinib but only experienced three
dose reductions amounting to 2.8% of receiving this drug.
Sorafenib, another oral drug, was reduced in 4.3% of our
patients, whereas the SHARP trial [7-8] reported that

patients receiving 5-FU. In fact, several studies comparing
capecitabine + oxaliplatin and 5-FU + oxaliplatin
concluded that the two treatments are comparable in terms
of both efficacy and toxicity [9-13].Such findings highlight
the difference between published data and our postmarketing data, which confirmed that capecitabine was
interrupted more frequently because of severer toxicity.
Ifosfamide was the most frequently reduced drug,
one in three patients stopping chemotherapy due to an
adverse event. A decidedly different issue (problem)
is that of nephrotoxicity during treatment. It has been
reported to be responsible for clinical nephrotoxicity in
around 30% of patients, although about 90% of cases also
manifest subclinical tubular toxicity with glycosuria and
β2-microglobulinuria [14]. In our study, the interruption
of ifosfamide was due to the development of renal failure.
In routine clinical practice, dose reduction or
treatment interruption is sometimes necessary when the
risk-benefit ratio of the drug is not worth for the patient.
Such action may also be taken in the event of unexpected
side-effects or complications/reactions that have not as yet
been identified as a side-effect of the drug in question. This
may happen because phase I, II and III studies generally
analyze no more than 2000 patients. This only allows
us to recognize common side effects, while uncommon
side effects are often not recognized in the early stages
of experimentation. Uncommon side-effects are those
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

reported in less than 1 case per thousand population
and it is the task of pharmacovigilance to identify them.
Although rare, the clinician must nevertheless be aware
of these events. In addition, patients enrolled onto
clinical trials are selected and do not reflect the patient
population. Generally, in the studies, patients are more
selected. Elderly patients and patients affected by heart
disease are excluded from studies. This patients are,
however, normally present in clinical practice. Therefore
pharmacovigilance system is very important for report any
toxicities in all categories of patients.
The main limitation of our study was the lack
of clinical data available, which led to difficulties in
analyzing the types of patients involved in the study. It
was not therefore possible to identify the clinical features
that may have contributed to the onset of the adverse
reactions studied.
In conclusion, this study shows that post-marketing
drug studies should be conducted in a more in-depth,
systematic way, thus allowing us to evaluate both the
effectiveness and the tolerance levels of the treatments.
A program of active pharmacovigilance such as the one
we have created at our institute is essential if the objective
is to continuously monitor cancer drugs. In our study, by
identifying patients who discontinued treatment we were
able to discern adverse reactions which were then included
in the National Network of Pharmacovigilance. A program

with the opportunity of identifying and reporting more
significant adverse events.

This retrospective observational study was designed
to monitor critical phenomena, including dose reduction
and treatment interruption, as potential indicators of
ADRs. The following centers were involved in the study:
IRST IRCCS, Meldola, Ravenna, Rimini and Reggio
Emilia Hospitals, and the University Hospitals of Bologna,
Ferrara and Parma. All consecutive cancer patients treated
with non-experimental cancer drugs in adjuvant, locally
advanced and metastatic settings were included in the
study. Dose reductions were taken into consideration
from 1st January 2012- 31st March 2013. Treatment
discontinuation was evaluated from 1st January 2012 to
28st February 2012 as this was considered long enough to
highlight any interruptions caused by adverse reactions.
Exclusion criteria were as follows: treatment regimens
lasting ≤ 60 day; treatment discontinuation because of
planned radiotherapy; non attendance for treatment; and
treatment discontinuation due to surgery.
Intravenous (5-fluorouracil, oxaliplatin, carboplatin,
docetaxel, paclitaxel, rituximab, pemetrexed, doxorubicin,
ifosfamide) and oral (erlotinib, sorafenib, lenalidomide,
capecitabine) drugs were considered for the study.
All data were retrieved from the institute’s
prescription pharmacy database (Log80).
Although no formal statistical hypotheses were
formulated due to the explorative nature of this study,
appropriate descriptive statistics were performed.
We analyzed the frequency of >10% dose reduction
during the first 90 days of treatment, calculated on the basis
of the actual dose administered to the patient rather than
the dose prescribed according to the regimen. Ninety days
were calculated as an appropriate length of time in which
an adverse reaction might occur. Treatment interruption
was calculated on the basis of the disappearance of the
patient’s name from the pharmacy database within 60 days
of the first prescription.
We used a regional administrative database. The
study database was anonymized by deleting the identity
of the patients and other sensitive information and by
assigning a unique numerical code to each individual.
When anonymized administrative data are used for
healthcare planning, studies are exempt from formal ethics
review and specific written consent is not required to use
patient information stored in hospital databases.
