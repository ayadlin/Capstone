ABSTRACT
Bladder cancer (BC) is distinguished by high rate of recurrence after surgery, but
the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we performed the wholeexome sequencing of 37 BC individuals including 20 primary and 17 recurrent samples
in which the primary and recurrent samples were not from the same patient. We
uncovered that MLL, EP400, PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5 exclusively altered in recurrent
BCs. Specifically, the recurrent BCs and bladder cancer cells with MLL mutation
displayed increased histone H3 tri-methyl K4 (H3K4me3) modification in tissue and
cell levels and showed enhanced expression of GATA4 and ETS1 downstream. What’s
more, MLL mutated bladder cancer cells obtained with CRISPR/Cas9 showed increased
ability of drug-resistance to epirubicin (a chemotherapy drug for bladder cancer)
than wild type cells. Additionally, the BC patients with high expression of GATA4 and
ETS1 significantly displayed shorter lifespan than patients with low expression. Our
study provided an overview of the genetic basis of recrudescent bladder cancer and
discovered that genetic alterations of MLL were involved in BC relapse. The increased
modification of H3K4me3 and expression of GATA4 and ETS1 would be the promising
targets for the diagnosis and therapy of relapsed bladder cancer.

carcinoma (>90%) is the major type of bladder cancer
and clinically divided into two major subtypes including
non-muscle-invasive and muscle-invasive tumors [3].
About 70% of the urothelial bladder carcinoma patients
are diagnosed with superficial non-muscle-invasive tumors
which are apt to recur with the rate of 31% to 78% within
five years but not life-threatening [4], while about 30%
of the patients succumb to muscle-invasive tumors with
a high risk of death from distant metastases [5]. Although
transurethral resection, radical cystectomy, bricker
operation combined with chemotherapy extend lifespan
of BC patients, the problem of easy recurrence remains
unsolved. It is very important to explicit the mechanisms
of bladder cancer relapse.
A previous study indicated that 30.8% BC patients
(135/438) developed intravesical recurrence with the
median interval of 15 months in a median follow-up
of 45 months in which lower tumor grade and tumor
multifocality correlated with the risk of tumor relapse [6].
In another cohort of 1529 patients with primary superficial
bladder cancer, the tumor size, number of tumors, the
presence of carcinoma in situ, stage T1 and Grade 2-3
have been correlated with disease recurrence [7]. After
transurethral resection of bladder cancer, intravesical
instillation of Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) or
mitomycin C decreased 30% and 15% of the recurrent rate
of BC respectively [8].
In addition to clinicopathologic indicators, emerging
results uncovered the potential molecular markers for
bladder cancer recurrence. Among them, the expression
of MDR1 increased in 89% of patients who showed
recurrence resulting from the decreased methylation at
the promoter region of MDR1 [9]. And high expression
of VEGF appeared to be significantly associated with BC
recurrence after nephroureterectomy [10]. Additionally, the
expression of estrogen receptor (ER) positively correlated
with recurrence free rate in non-muscle-invasive bladder
cancer by suppressing cadherin switch [11]. Interestingly,
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were
indicated in the process of BC relapse [12, 13]. These
studies supported that the gained expression of N-cadherin
positively correlated with bladder carcinoma recurrence
after nephroureterectomy.
Accumulating evidence suggests the relationship
between the genetic alteration and BC recurrence. For
example, the deletion of chromosome 9 was a predictive
marker for tumor recrudescence [14]. Furthermore, IL-6
gene promoter single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
(G174C) was associated with increased recurrence risk in
patients with maintenance BCG treatment and peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARG) SNP (Pro12Ala)
was associated with reduced recurrence risk in non-treated
patients [15].
Although lots of markers have been reported as
independent indicators for bladder cancer recurrence and
prognosis, they are of limited applicable value. Firstly,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the mRNA expression levels of MDR1 [9] and VEGFR
[10] predicted a poor prognosis of bladder cancer patients,
while the relationship of proteins expression levels
of MDR1 and VEGFR and bladder cancer recurrence
remain unclear. Furthermore, ER [11] and EMT markers
[12, 13] were not promising markers of bladder cancer
recurrence due to the subjectivity and false positivity of
the immunohistochemistry method. Finally, the variant
IL-6 genotype was associated with an increased recurrence
risk, its application scope should be examined in a larger
cohort.
So far, the genetic analysis for recurrent BCs
compared to primary ones is still at its preliminary stage.
And no molecular target agents have been approved for
the treatment of recurrent bladder cancer. Here we provide
an insight into the difference of genetic basis between
17 recurrent BC samples and 20 primary ones with the
method of exome sequencing and discover that the
alterations of MLL are involved in BC relapse. MLL codes
a transcriptional coactivator which plays an essential
role in gene expression regulating during early embryo
development and hematopoiesis [16]. It contains a SET
(suppressor of variegation, enhancer of zeste, trithorax)
domain at the C-terminus and belongs to a member of the
MLL/trx family that specifically methylates lysine 4 on
histone H3 (H3K4), a modification typically associated
with transcriptionally active regions of chromatin [17].
Genomic rearrangements of the human chromosomal
band 11q23 involving MLL are frequent events in pediatric
leukemia, appearing in more than 70% of infant acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and approximately 10% of
acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cases [17]. Although
MLL family members frequently altered in bladder cancer
[5, 18, 19], the exact function of MLLs in bladder cancer
remains unclear. In this paper, MLL particularly altered
in recurrent bladder cancers with elevated modification of
H3K4me3 and increased expression of GATA4 and ETS1
downstream. We introduced the specific mutations of MLL
into bladder cancer cells with the method of CRISPR/
Cas9 and the mutated cell exhibited enhanced H3K4me3
modification and elevated expression of GATA4 and
ETS1 downstream, which endowed bladder cancer cells
with the capability of drug-resistance to chemotherapy
drug epirubicin. Taken together, MLL mutation, elevated
GATA4 and EST1 would be the promising biomarkers
for diagnosis and targets for treatment of bladder cancer
recrudescence.

the primary and recurrent bladder cancer samples
(Supplementary Figures 3-4).
In validation experiments, 1,023 (91%) somatic
substitutions and 67 (74%) indels are confirmed
respectively on 1,119 predicted somatic substitutions and
91 indels by Sanger sequencing20. In order to uncover
the common and distinct altered genes between primary
bladder cancer samples and recurrent ones, we assessed
the statistical significance of the observed mutation
prevalence for the genes with the method of mutcigCV
[5]. In total, we identified 24 significantly mutated genes
in 37 BCs (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 4) including
four well-known bladder cancer related genes (TP53 [20,
21], HRAS [22], FGFR3 [22], and PIK3CA [23, 24]).
Among the differentially mutated genes between
the primary group and recurrent group samples, MLL,
EP400, PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5 mutations were
identified and confirmed exclusively in the recurrent
BCs (Figure 1 and Supplementary Table 4). Interestingly,
three genes displayed significant difference between the
two groups including MLL (encoding a transcriptional
coactivator responsible for histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4)
methylation) [25], EP400 (encoding a component of the
NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex that positively
regulates transcription) [26] and PRDM2 (encoding a
nuclear histone/protein methyltransferase that regulates
transcription during neuronal differentiation and

Frequently mutated genes identified in 37 bladder
carcinomas
To improve our understanding of the genetic basis
of recurrent bladder carcinoma, we performed wholeexome sequencing of 37 pairs of tumors and matched
peripheral blood samples including 20 primary bladder
tumors and 17 recrudescent ones parallelly in which the
primary and recurrent samples were not from the same
patient. (Supplementary Table 1). Then we acquired
a mean coverage depth of ~60× for all the samples
sequenced, with at least ~80% of the targeted bases being
sufficiently covered (≥10×) (Supplementary Figure 1 and
Supplementary Tables 2-3). Additionally, the average
sequencing depth of these two groups remained similar
and showed no significant difference (Supplementary
Figure 1D). After several rigorous bioinformatic analysis
steps (Online Methods), up to 4152 candidate somatic
mutations and 831 insertions and deletions (indels)
were identified in our 37 samples [20]. The C->T/G->A
mutation dominated the mutation spectrum in 37 bladder
cancer samples (Supplementary Figure 2). Moreover, the
different types of single nucleotide variants (SNV) and
indels displayed the similar mutation patterns between

Taken together, the mutations of MLL, EP400 and PRDM2
may be involved in bladder carcinoma relapse.

MLL, EP400 and PRDM2 exclusively alter in
recurrent bladder carcinomas

Accumulating studies indicate that the deregulation
of remodeling complex and epigenetic regulators
contribute to bladder carcinoma tumorigenesis [1, 5]. In
our study, MLL, EP400 and PRDM2 exclusively mutated
in the recurrent BCs. In order to uncover the mechanisms
underlying BC recurrence mediated by these mutations,
we first analyzed the mRNA expression levels of MLL,
EP400 and PRDM2 by real time PCR (RT-PCR) between
the non-mutated primary group and the mutated recurrent
group (n=20 for primary tumors, n=4 for recurring
tumors). The expression levels of MLL, EP400 and
PRDM2 showed no significant difference between these
two groups (Figure 3A). We next analyzed the levels
of H3K4me3, acetylated histone H4 and H3K9me3
modification corresponding to the enzyme activity of
MLL, EP400 and PRDM2 in the former two groups with
the method of immunohistochemistry. Interestingly, only
H3K4me3 modification did increase significantly (2.8
fold) in the recurrent tumors with MLL mutation (RT
MLL mut, n=4) rather than that of primary tumor with
WT MLL (PT MLL WT, n=20) with the same levels
of MLL expression (Figure 3B). Overall staining for
MLL and H3K4me3 was measured by multiplication of
staining intensity on a numerical scale (none = 1, weak
= 2, moderate = 3, strong = 4) and staining percentage
(0%–100%), resulting in an overall product score (Figure
3B). However, the acetylated histone H4 and H3K9me3
modification displayed no significant difference between
the respective paired groups (data not shown). These
results suggested that MLL mutation may participate in
bladder cancer recurrence dependent on the increased
modification of H3K4me3.
As a histone methyltransferase, MLL catalyzes
H3K4me3 modification promoting gene transcription
[25]. To identify the target genes activated in MLL
mutated recurrent group, some reported candidate targets
(such as GATA4, GATA6, MMP2, MMP13, ETS1 and
HOXA9) related to tumorigenesis, drug resistance and
cancer progression were selected [28]. In RT-PCR assay,
the expression levels of GATA4 and ETS1 remarkably
increased 2~3 fold in RT MLL mut than that of PT MLL
WT (Figure 3C). To further confirm the up-regulation of
GATA4 and ETS1 in MLL mutated tumors, tissue lysates
were applied for western blot analysis. Similarly, MLL
displayed same expression levels in RT MLL mut and
PT MLL WT, but the modification of H3K4me3 and the
expression of GATA4 and ETS1 significantly increased
4~5 fold in RT MLL mut than that of PT MLL WT (Figure
3D). We next carried out chromatin immunoprecipitation
assay (ChIP) to investigate the H3K4me3 modification
of GATA or ETS1 promoters in former two groups. We

To confirm the relationship between the specific
gene mutation and the primary/recurrent tumors,
mutation frequencies of MLL, EP400, PRDM2, MLL3,
EP300, FGFR3, HRAS, TP53 and RB1 were calculated
for differential analysis. In particular, MLL, EP400 and
PRDM2 exclusively mutated in recurrent tumors (4/17,
p = 0.04) which indicated their association with BC
recrudescence. However, MLL3 (2/20, p = 0.49) and
EP300 (3/20, p = 0.23) exclusively mutated in primary
tumors indicating that chromatin remodeling genes (MLL,
MLL3, EP300 and EP400) may play distinct roles in
primary and recurrent BC tumorigenesis (Figure 2A and
Supplementary Table 5). In addition, non-muscle-invasive
BC related genes FGFR3 mutated in both primary tumors
(2/20, 10.0%) and relapsed tumors (3/17, 17.6%) and
HRAS altered in both primary tumors (6/20, 30.0%)
and recurring tumors (1/17, 5.9%). But they showed no
significant difference between these two groups (p=0.64
for FGFR3 and p = 0.10 for HRAS) (Figure 2A). Similarly,
muscle-invasive BC related genes TP53 mutated in both
primary tumors (3/20, 15.0%) and recurrent tumors (4/17,
23.5%) and RB1 altered in primary tumors (1/20, 5.0%)
and recrudescent tumors (2/17, 11.8%). But they displayed
no remarkable difference between these two groups (p =
0.68 for TP53 and p = 0.58 for RB1) (Figure 2A).
Then we focused on the exclusively mutated genes
in recurrent BCs. In addition to the mutation frequencies
of those genes, we analyzed the mutation status of MLL,
EP400 and PRDM2. In particular, 23.5% of the recurrent
samples had MLL mutations (4 out of 17, p = 0.04), and
all the mutations in MLL were non-synonymous SNV.
Only one mutation named c.C4437G substitution located
in the typical PHD domain and others located in the linker
region instead (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 4).
Furthermore, 23.5% of the recurrent samples had EP400
mutations (4 out of 17, p = 0.04) including one splicing
named c.2629-1G>- and three non-synonymous SNV.
However, none of the mutations located in the typical
structural domain (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table
4). For PRDM2, 23.5% of the recurrent samples had
PRDM2 mutations (4 out of 17, p = 0.04) including one
nonsense mutation, one frameshift-insertion and two nonsynonymous SNV (Figure 2B and Supplementary Table 4).
These results indicated that the specific mutation of MLL
located in the PHD domain may influence the binding
function of MLL and chromosome or targets. However,
the nonsense and insertion mutations suggested that
PRDM2 may function as a suppressor in BC recurrence.

observed a 5~6 fold enrichment of GATA4 and ETS1
promoters with the H3K4me3 antibody in RT MLL mut
than that in PT MLL WT (Figure 3E). These results
demonstrated that the H3K4me3 modification of GATA
and ETS1 promoters and the expression levels of GATA4
and ETS1 correlated with bladder cancer relapse.
Further in Suk-Chul Bae’s datasets [29], the BC
patients with high expression of GATA4 and ETS1
significantly displayed shorter lifespan than patients with
low expression (P = 0.0049 for GATA4 and P = 0.0002
for ETS1) (Figure 3F). The elevated expression of GATA4
and ETS1 negatively correlated with the prognosis of
bladder cancer patients and may be involved in bladder
cancer relapse.

In this study, the 20 primary and 17 recurrent
bladder cancer samples were not from the same patient.
According to the clinical information of 37 bladder cancer
samples, the stage ranged from Ta to T3 in the distinct
two groups and the high grade samples composed 8/20
and 10/17 of primary and relapsed group respectively.
Based on these two clinical characteristics, there is no
significant difference between primary and recurrent
groups. Nevertheless, in order to exclude the possibility
that different MLL mutation frequencies resulted from
different clinical characteristics, we validated the
mutation status of MLL in a 40 low grade primary and

sequence of MLL in chr11:118359433C position (hg19)
(Figure 4A and data not shown). Then we applied the
CRISPR/Cas9 technology [30] to obtain the specific
mutation of MLL in T24 bladder cancer cell lines. After
Sanger sequencing confirmation, we obtained the mutated
T24 cells mimic the c.C4437G mutation (Figure 4A). At
first, we compared the expression levels of MLL between
T24 wild type cells (T24 WT) and T24 mutation cells
(T24 Mut) and found that the quantity of MLL remained

unchanged in T24 Mut in both mRNA and protein levels
compared with T24 WT (Figure 4B and 4C). Nevertheless,
the H3K4me3 modification increased 4 fold in T24 Mut
than that of T24 WT (Figure 4C). Meanwhile, GATA4
and ETS1 as MLL targets increased their expression
2~3 fold in T24 Mut than that of T24 WT (Figure 4B
and 4C). Additionally, 2~3 fold and 5~6 fold H3K4me3
modification harbored the promoters of GATA4 and ETS1
respectively in T24 Mut than that of T24 WT (Figure 4D).

These data demonstrated that the specific mutation of MLL
in T24 bladder cancer cells promoted the transcription of
GATA4 and ETS1.
To further verify the drug-resistant function of MLL
mutation in bladder cancer cells, epirubicin was used in
the functional experiments in vitro, which is widely used
as a chemotherapeutic drug in intravesical instillation for
bladder cancer patients [31]. 10 µg/ml epirubicin was
applied to induce apoptosis of T24 WT and T24 Mut for
24h and 48h. Results from fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) indicated that T24 WT showed 2 fold
Annexin-V positive apoptosis cells than that of T24 Mut
after epirubicin treatment for 24h and 48h (Figure 4E).
To exam whether MLL mutation influenced cancer cell
proliferation and cell cycle progression, T24 WT and
T24 Mut showed comparable proliferation rate without
epirubicin in the proliferation assay (Figure 4F). Under the
stimulation of epirubicin, T24 WT displayed significant
decrease in cell numbers (~30%) while T24 Mut kept a
relative high rate of proliferation (Figure 4F). Similar
results obtained from cell cycle analysis, T24 WT and
T24 Mut displayed homologous cell cycle distribution
without epirubicin. Epirubicin treatment decreased
the ratio of G0-1 phase (58%) and induced cell cycle
arrest in G2-M phase in T24 WT (375%), but T24 Mut
showed no obvious change (Figure 4G). These results
illustrated that MLL mutation had no intrinsic influence
on the propagation ability and cell cycle progression,
but changed the susceptibility of bladder cancer cells to
chemotherapeutics.
Actually, the acquisition of the rest of the three
mutations of MLL were carried out. Unfortunately, there
is no target sites recognized by Streptococcus pyogenes
Cas9 (PAM, a protospacer adjacent motif) around the
mutation site g.chr11:118375263C>G from B71, and this
mutation could not be obtained by the method of Cas9
described in this study. Moreover, the cell line with the
mutation of g.chr11: 118348796G>A from W100 were
not screened through three independent experiments.
Finally, we got the T24 cell line with the mutation of
g.chr11:118374172C>T from B73 (T24 Mut2) with the
same method (Supplementary Figure 6A). In a similar
manner, the mutation of MLL had no effect on the
expression itself (Supplementary Figure 6B and 6C), but
activated the transcription of targets GATA4 and ETS1
(Supplementary Figure 6B-6D). Additionally, although
T24 Mut2 cells displayed analogous proliferation ability,
they harbored the elevated drug-resistance capability to
epirubicin and showed less apoptosis cells (42%), more
cells survival (329%) and normal cell cycle distribution
compared with T24 WT cells with the treatment of
epirubicin (Supplementary Figure 6E-6G). Taken
together, GATA4 and ETS1 overexpression mediated by
MLL mutation enhanced the ability of drug-resistant to
epirubicin which endowed mutated bladder tumor cells
the advantage of survival and recurrence in the presence

of chemotherapeutics.

GATA4 and ETS1 participate in the drugresistance of MLL mutated bladder cancer cells
In order to clarify the function of MLL mutation in
vivo, xenograft bladder cancer models in mice were thus
employed in which 2×106 T24 WT and T24 Mut cells
were injected subcutaneously into the back of nude mice
respectively. One week after tumor implantation, 2 mg/
kg epirubicin or DMSO was injected intraperitoneally
twice per week and the volume of established tumors
was measured every five days. On day 30, the mice were
sacrificed and the therapeutic effect was evaluated. With
the addition of DMSO, T24 WT and T24 Mut displayed
analogous propagation curves (Figure 5A). While under
the treatment of epirubicin, the proliferation of T24 WT
was significantly suppressed (17.23%, P < 0.01), but
T24 Mut cells could still establish the remarkable tumors
comparable to that in DMSO condition (87.80%, P > 0.05)
(Figure 5A). Moreover, the tumor formation of T24 WT
and T24 Mut under the treatment of epirubicin showed
significant difference (P < 0.01) (Figure 5A). These data
indicated that, in consistence with the data from in vitro,
MLL mutation enhanced the ability of drug-resistance in
bladder cancer in vivo. As the activated targets in MLL
mutation cells, whether GATA4 and ETS1 participated in
this drug-resistance process was also examined in vivo.
In the first place, GATA4, ETS1 and both of them were
silenced with lentivirus and the efficiencies of knockdown
were examined in RT-PCR experiments (Figure 5B). Then
the four types of cells including T24 Mut shCtrl, T24
Mut shGATA4, T24 Mut shETS1 and T24 Mut Double
sh were carried out in xenograft bladder cancer models
in mice. Under the addition of DMSO, T24 Mut shETS1
and T24 Mut Double sh displayed a remarkable decrease
in tumor volume, which suggested that the depletion of
ETS1 (31.85%, P < 0.05) and both of GATA4 and ETS1
(41.16%, P < 0.05) inhibited the growth of T24 Mut cells
(Figure 5C). Finally, the tumor formations of T24 Mut
shGATA4 (50.83%, P < 0.05), T24 Mut shETS1 (62.79%,
P < 0.01) and T24 Mut Double sh (82.10%, P < 0.01) were
significantly suppressed compared with T24 Mut shCtrl
with the addition of epirubicin (Figure 5C). Collectively,
T24 Mut cells showed robust cell proliferation and
tumor formation even under the treatment of epirubicin
compared to T24 WT cells. When GATA4 and ETS1 were
depleted, the tumor propagation and formation were
significantly inhibited. All these data indicated GATA4
and ETS1 played essential roles in the drug resistance of
MLL mutated bladder cancer cells.

DISCUSSION
The recurrence of bladder carcinoma (BC) is the key
2637

Oncotarget

problem need to be solved for both clinicians and scientific
researchers, while none effective prevention and treatment
strategies have been proposed during last thirty years. In
this study, 20 primary and 17 recurrent bladder cancer
samples were collected for whole-exome sequencing.
After discovery and confirmation, five genes MLL, EP400,
PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5 significantly correlated with
the recurrence of bladder cancer. Specifically, MLL
mutation in recurrent bladder cancer samples and T24
cell lines acquired the elevated H3K4me3 activity and
transcriptional activation of target genes GATA4 and
ETS1. The increased expression of GATA4 and ETS1
contributed to enhance the drug-resistance ability
during the progression and recurrence of bladder cancer.
Nevertheless, the primary and recurrent samples applied
in exome sequencing were not from the same patient, the
mutation status and distinct functions of MLL, EP400,
PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5 should be better researched
and confirmed in primary and recurrent samples obtained
from the same patient in the future study. It will reveal
whether the specific mutation plays an indispensable role
in bladder cancer recrudescence.
In the former studies, several candidate markers
were indicated in the process of BC recurrence. For
example, high expression of MDR1 [9],VEGF [10]
and NCAD [12, 13] significantly associated with BC
recurrence after nephroureterectomy. In addition, the
expression of estrogen receptor (ER) positively correlated
with recurrence free rate in non-muscle-invasive bladder
cancer by suppressing cadherin switch [11]. With DNA
methylation array analysis, Kim YJ et, al discovered
that the highly methylation pattern in promoters of
HOXA9, ISL1 and ALDH1A3 and their decreased
protein expression levels significantly associated with
aggressive clinicopathologic features [32]. Moreover,
the deletion of chromosome 9 and the single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) of IL-6 gene promoter (G174C)
positively correlated with BC relapse [15]. However, the
SNP of PPARG (Pro12Ala) was negatively associated
with the recurrent BC [15]. Although several molecular
markers of bladder cancer prognosis have been identified,
the limited value of current prognostic markers has created
the need for new molecular indicators of bladder cancer
progression and recurrence.
Unfortunately, all these markers or targets above
were not applied into the clinical diagnosis and treatment
yet. In order to uncover the genetic basis of recurrent BC
compared to primary ones for the better understanding of
bladder cancer recurrence and searching for the targets for
its therapy. We carried out the whole-exome sequencing of
recurrent and primary bladder cancer samples parallelly.
Beyond confirming mutations in genes previously
identified in BC, we uncovered five frequently altered
genes exclusively in recurrent BC including MLL, EP400,
PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5. In particular, four recurrent
BCs harbored four distinct non-synonymous SNV in MLL
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

locus in which one mutation located in the typical PHD
domain named c.C4437G substitution.
MLL usually underwent frameshift mutation and
rearrangement in bladder carcinoma and leukemia,
in which MLL lost its normal function including the
methyltransferase activity. On the one hand, the knockout
of MLL in normal bladder epithelium would promote
the initiation of bladder cancer according to the data
from high throughput sequencing, in which three out of
nine is nonsense or indel mutation [5], two out of nine is
indel mutation [20] and more than 50% mutations were
nonsense [1]. It means that approximately 20%~50%
bladder cancer initiations positively correlated with the
nonsense or loss-of-function of MLL. Thus, combined
with others carcinogenic factors, the knockout of MLL in
normal bladder epithelium could induce the tumorigenesis
of bladder cancer. On the other hand, if MLL played as
also a tumor suppressor in the formative bladder cancer
hierarchy, it is could be speculated the knockout of
MLL may help the bladder cancer cells into a more
aggressive type, which should be further investigated.
However, the same protein in the different stage of tumor
formation may function in the distinct ways, at least in the
current study. In detail, four specific mutations of MLL
(g.chr11:118359433C>G, B112; g.chr11:118375263C>G,
B71; g.chr11:118375263C>G, B73 and g.chr11:
118348796G>A, W100) exclusively occurred in recurrent
bladder cancer samples rather than the primary ones and
these mutations belonged to the gain-of-function, different
from that of loss-of-function in primary bladder cancers.
In our study, the c.C4437G substitution in PHD
domain and c.C7565T mutation of MLL locus do not
change the mRNA and protein expression levels but
increased the whole level of H3K4me3 modification in
the recurrent group than that of primary group. According
to the previous study, Wang P et, al. undertook a genomewide analysis of H3K4 methylation patterns in Mll1(+/+)
and Mll1(-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [28].
We selected six candidates related to tumorigenesis, drugresistance and cancer progression, and discovered that the
promoters of GATA4 and ETS1 were occupied with more
H3K4me3 modification resulting in enhanced expression
of mRNA and protein levels of GATA4 and ETS1 in
recurrent tumors and T24 Mut with MLL mutation
compared with primary tumors and T24 WT with wild
type MLL respectively.
GATA4 belongs to a member of the GATA family of
zinc-finger transcription factors which is indicated in the
process of derivation and propagation of urothelium from
hESCs and hiPS cells normally [33]. Besides the normal
development function, GATA4 was reported as a potential
tumor suppressor of colorectal cancer, lung cancer and
ovarian cancer [34-36]. Moreover, recent studies indicated
an oncogene function of GATA4 in cancer, including
gastric carcinoma, breast carcinoma and ovarian cancer
[37-39]. However, the relationship between GATA4
2638

Oncotarget

and bladder cancer have not been reported so far. ETS1
encodes a member of the ETS family of transcription
factor which is involved in stem cell development, cell
senescence and death, and tumorigenesis. Sari, Aysegul
et al. found that non-muscle-invasive tumors had
significantly higher ETS1 expression than that of the
muscle-invasive tumors [40], indicating its special role in
superficial bladder carcinoma. Additionally, the promoter
of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene frequently
mutated in bladder carcinoma in which ETS1 bond to
the altered promoter and promoted bladder carcinoma
migration and progression [41].
In this study, we introduced the MLL mutation into
bladder cancer transitional cell line T24 and confirmed
that the mutation didn’t influence the expression of MLL
but increased the H3K4me3 modification in GATA4 and
ETS1 promoters and the expression levels of GATA4 and
ETS1. Furthermore, epirubicin induced wild type T24
cells undergoing obvious apoptosis and inhibited cell
propagation significantly in vitro. However, T24 Mut
displayed slightly increased apoptosis and kept the rapid
proliferation rate under the stimulation of epirubicin.
Additionally, T24 WT and T24 Mut displayed homologous
cell cycle distribution in cell cycle analysis without
epirubicin. Epirubicin treatment decreased the ratio of
G0-1 phase and induced cell cycle arrest in G2-M phase
in T24 WT, but T24 Mut showed no obvious change.
All these data supported that MLL mutation in recurrent
tumors and T24 cells enhanced the drug-resistant ability.
As for their mutation types and protein functions, we
speculated that these three mutations belonged to gain-offunction mutations and the altered the protein harbored
the enhanced activity of H3K4me3 modification in target
genes such as GATA4 and ETS1 dependent on the data
from primary tissues (Figure 3) and cell lines with the
specific mutations (Figure 4). Moreover, GATA4 and
ETS1 played an indispensable role in the drug-resistance
of bladder cancer cells with MLL mutation (Figure 5).
Nevertheless, these nonsynonymous mutations of
bladder cancer are different from those alterations from
acute lymphoid leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia in
which the translocation and rearrangement dominate the
mutation types. From the aspect of results of these two
distinct mutation types, the gain-of-function of these
bladder cancer specific mutations activating GATA4 and
ETS1 seem like the translocation and rearrangement
alterations from leukemia in which the MLL truncation
and fusion proteins activated the transcription of target
genes such as Hox genes and induced cell transformation.
Taken together, in recurrent bladder cancer
samples with MLL alterations, the mRNA and protein
expression levels of MLL displayed unchanged, but
the H3K4me3 enzyme activity of MLL increased
significantly. Meanwhile, the target genes GATA4 and
ETS1 were activated through the elevated H3K4me3
modifications in their promoters which were mediated by
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the methyltransferase MLL. These results indicated that
the mutated MLL protein may have a distinct structure
which contributes to the close binding between MLL
and other cofactors or DNA sequence, resulting in a
swifter recruitment of other cofactors, DNA binding
and H3K4me3 modifications in specific targets, such as
GATA4 and ETS1 in this study. Furthermore, the enhanced
expression of GATA4 and ETS1 indeed contributed
to the drug-resistance of bladder cancer cells. Thus,
MLL mutation, GATA4 and ETS1 may be used as a the
biomarkers for diagnosis and targets for treatment of
bladder cancer recrudescence.
Nevertheless, the expression profile of MLL mutated
tumor cells and the mechanism of drug-resistant mediated
by transcription factors GATA4 and ETS1 should be
further identified. Additionally, the contribution of
specific alterations of EP400, PRDM2, ANK3 and CHD5
to bladder carcinoma recurrence should also be further
investigated.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Genomic DNA extraction and Illumina based
whole-exome sequencing
Genomic DNAs of tumor and matched peripheral
blood samples from 37 bladder carcinoma patients were
isolated and the DNA libraries were constructed according
to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. For wholeexome sequencing (WES), genomic DNAs from the same
37 tumor-blood pairs were fragmented and subjected to
whole-exome captured by SureSelect Human All Exon
50Mb Kit (Agilent Technologies). Then the libraries were
pair-end sequenced on HiSeq 2000 platform to generate
2x100 bps reads. The insert size of the sequence library
was 200bp ~ 300bp.

Read mapping and detection of somatic mutations
Exact same pipeline was used as previously
described [20]. After removing reads containing
sequencing adaptors and low-quality reads with more than
five unknown bases, the high quality reads were gapped
aligned to the NCBI human reference genome (hg19)
using BWA. Then, we performed local realignment of the
BWA aligned reads and base quality recalibration using
the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) (1.2-44-g794f275).
The raw lists of potential somatic substitutions were called
by VarScan (v2.2.5). In this process, several heuristic rules
were applied: (i) both the tumors and matched normal
samples should be covered sufficiently (≥ 10×) at the
genomic position being compared; (ii) the average base
quality for a given genomic position should be at least 15
in both the tumors and normal samples; (iii) the variants
2639

Oncotarget

The significantly mutated genes

should be supported by at least 10% of the total reads in
the tumors while no high quality variant-supporting reads
are allowed in normal controls; (iv) the variants should be
supported by at least five reads in the tumors.
Using the same criteria, the preliminary lists of
somatic indels was called out by GATK based on the
local realignment results. After these two steps, germline
variants could be effectively removed. To further reduce
the false positive calls, variations including single
nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels were called with the
SAMtools software package in the tumors. We eliminated
all somatic variants that fulfill any one of the following
filtering criterion: (i) variants with Phred-like scaled
consensus scores or SNP qualities < 20; (ii) variants with
mapping qualities < 30; (iii) indels represented by only
one DNA strand; (iv) substitutions located 30bp around
predicted indels. To deal with false positives associated
with pseudo gene issues or repeat sequences, simulated
reads (80bp in length) containing the potential mutations
were generated and aligned to the reference genome.
For a given variants, if more than 10% of the simulated
variant-containing reads could not be uniquely mapped
to the reference genome, this variant would be discarded.
In order to eliminate any previously described germline
variants, the somatic mutations were cross-referenced
against the dbSNP (version 137). Any mutations present
in above data sets were filtered out and the remaining
mutations were subjected to subsequent analyses. In these
two process, MutSigCV_1.4 was used for identification of
the significantly mutated genes.

MutsigCV was used to prioritize the significantly
mutated genes in primary and recurrent bladder
carcinomas respectively.

Primary antibodies
The primary antibodies were rabbit polyclonal
to GATA4 (Abcam, US; ab84593), rabbit polyclonal
to ETS1 (Abcam, US; ab26096), rabbit polyclonal to
Histone H3 (trimethyl K4)-ChIP Grade (Abcam, US;
ab8580), mouse anti-human MLL antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, US; sc-374392) and mouse Anti-β-actin
antibody (Sigma, Germany; A1978). Corresponding
species-specific horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) labelled
secondary antibodies (Pierce, US) were used.

Western blot
Tumor tissues were cut into pieces and lysed with
RIPA buffer [42] (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5%
sodium desoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 2 mM
PMSF, 20 mg/ml aprotinin, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, 10 mg/
ml pepstatin A, 150 mM benzamidine, and 1% Nonidet
P-40) for 30min on ice, followed by centrifugalization,
supernatant was collected for protein quantification. A total
of 40μg of protein was added in a 4–12% gel and probed
with according antibodies as previously described43.

Validation of somatic substitutions and indels by
Sanger sequencing

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA was isolated from bladder carcinomas
and human bladder cancer cell lines using the RNA
isolation kit (Tiangen Biotech, CHN) according to the
manufacturer’ s protocol. RNA was then subjected to
cDNA synthesis using M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase
(Promega, US) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The cDNA was then processed for an amplification step
with the SYBR Green reaction system (Tiangen Biotech,
CHN) running on an ABI 7300 machine (Applied
Biosystems, US). The RT-PCR results were normalized
using β-actin as endogenous control.

Non-silent somatic substitutions and indels were
validated by Sanger sequencing. The PCR primers for
putative somatic variants were designed by primer 3
in silicon and initially used to amplify the source DNA
from the tumors. PCR was performed on Dual 96 well
GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems) and
20ng template DNA from each sample was used per
reaction. The products were sequenced by 3730xl DNA
Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). All sequences were
analyzed by the Sequencing Analysis Software Version 5.2
(Applied Biosystems). To determine the somatic status of
the confirmed mutation in tumor, the same primer pair was
used to amplify the matched blood DNA.
The MLL mutations discovered exclusively in
recurrent bladder tumors have been validated in a larger
cohort (Supplementary Table 6). The primer pairs for MLL
amplification are included in Supplementary Table 7.

Cell and sample description and preparation
The Cell line T24 was obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, US). The primary and
recurrent tumor samples with matched peripheral blood
were obtained from bladder carcinoma patients newly
diagnosed at the member institutions of the Urinogenital
Cancer Genomics Consortium (BCGC) in China with
informed consent. Detailed clinical information for the
2640

Oncotarget

patients is summarized in Supplementary Tables 1 and
6. All the specimens were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen
upon collection and immediately stored at -80°C for
further study. Especially, the primary tumor samples
were transurethral resection specimen taken prior to the
administration of any chemotherapy, whereas the recurrent
tumor samples were all transurethral resection specimens
taken from patients who had received epirubicin
chemotherapy after the former transurethral resection.
Clinically, an immediate instillation of chemotherapy
after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT)
or extended partial cystectomy was given to all patients
(50mg epirubicin in 50ml saline). All patients were
followed up for 3 years with a cystoscopy per 3 months.
The recrudescent tumor samples from nine patients
with localized muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma who
underwent extended partial cystectomy resulted from their
refusal of radical cystectomy strongly or their vital status
limits.

according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells
were washed twice with cold PBS, digested, collected, and
resuspended to binding buffer. Annexin V-FITC and PI
were added (BioVision, Milpitas, CA, USA), and the cells
were incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark.
Then, 200 μl binding buffer was added, and the Annexin
V positive cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometry system (BD Biosciences, US).

Immunohistochemistry
Urothelial bladder carcinomas were fixed in
4% formaldehyde followed by embedding in paraffin.
Tissue was sectioned into 5 μm thick sections for
immunohistochemistry staining. Antigen retrieval was
done with heat-induced for 30min in citrate acid buffer
(PH=6.0). Primary antibodies of MLL and H3K4me3
were applied overnight at 4°C, and the corresponding
specific horseradish-peroxidase (HRP) labelled secondary
antibodies were used for DAB coloration. The nucleus
were counter stained with hematoxylin. Overall staining
for MLL/H3K4me3 was measured by multiplication of
staining percentage (0%–100%) and staining intensity on a
numerical scale (none = 1, weak = 2, moderate = 3, strong
= 4), resulting in an overall product score.

Cell proliferation assay
The proliferation and viability of T24 WT and T24
Mut/T24 Mut2 were measured by the cell counting kit-8
(CCK-8; Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan) colorimetric assay
with triplicate experiments for each set of conditions. The
same amount of cells (3×103 cells/ well) were seeded on
96-well culture plates and cultured with/without 10 µg/
ml epirubicin for 24 and 48h. At the indicated time point,
the supernatant was removed, and 100 μl of DMEM
medium containing 10 μl of CCK8 was added to each
well for 1 h at 37°C. The absorbance at 450 nm was
measured with a plate reader (Multiskan GO Microplate
Spectrophotometer; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.,
Waltham, MA, USA).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
Chromatin immunoprecipitation was performed by
using the ChIP assay kit according to the manufacturer’s
instructions
(Upstate
Biotechnology).
Briefly,
approximately 10 million T24 WT and T24 Mut/T24 Mut2
were crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at
37°C, washed with PBS, and resuspended in lysis buffer.
The cell lysate was sonicated on ice for a total of 2 min (in
5 s pulses), resulting in an average DNA fragment length
of 500 bp. After removing cell debris by centrifugation
and preclearing the lysate, immunoprecipitation was
performed in ChIP dilution buffer overnight with antiHistone H3 (tri methyl K4) antibody with agitation.
Protein A agarose/Salmon Sperm DNA (Merck Millipore,
Guyancourt, France) slurry was added and incubated
for 2-4h at 4°C with agitation. The antibody-agarose
complex was centrifuged and washed five times, and the
immunoprecipitated fraction was eluted. The crosslinking
was reversed by incubation at 65°C for 4h in the presence
of 200 mM NaCl. The DNA was recovered by phenol/
chloroform extraction and precipitated, and the abundance
of specific sequence was measured by PCR using the
corresponding primer sequences.

Cell cycle assay
T24 WT and T24 Mut/T24 Mut2 were cultured
with/without 10 µg/ml epirubicin for 48h, digested
and collected by trypsin, fixed in 70% ethanol at -20°C
overnight and then stained with 50 µg/ml propidium
iodide (PI) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.1 µg/ml
RNase A (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cells were
analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometry system (BD
Biosciences, US). Cell Quest software (BD Cell Quest Pro
Software, BD Biosciences, US) was used to analyze the
percentage of the cell population in each phase.

Cellular apoptosis assay
T24 WT and T24 Mut/T24 Mut2 were cultured
with/without 10 μg/ml epirubicin for 24h and 48h, and
apoptosis was assessed with the Annexin V-FITC kit

gene targeting sites in for sgRNA design was
5’-AATTCTGTCACGTTTGTGGAAGG-3’ (B112) and
5’-ACTTTGACTGTGCGTTTCCGTGG-3’ (B73) and
the primers were ordered from Sangon Biotech Company
(Shanghai, China). The sgRNA was inserted into two
AarI site between the U6 promoter and sgRNA tails
were juxtaposed right about to created two overhangs
that exactly match the annealed sgRNA pair. The Cas9
sequence was consistent with previous report, and was
ordered from Sangon Biotech Company (Shanghai, China).
The T7 promoter was added upstream of the Cas9 coding
region. All the sequences were synthesized and inserted
to the T-CMV-MCS-BGPA vector to form CMV-Cas9
expression vector (Supplementary Figure 5). Genomic
DNA was phenol-chloroform extracted from G418resistant T24 cell colonies. Cell identification was carried
out in PCR reactions of 50 ng genomic DNA, 10pmol of
each primer (forward 5’ AATCTCCCGCAGTGTCCAAT
3’ and reverse 5’ CTCCCTCAGCCTCCCAAGTA 3’)
and 0.5 unit of rTaq polymerase (Takara). PCR conditions
were as follows; 5 min at 95°C ; 35 cycles of 30 sec.
at 95°C , 30 sec. at 62°C , 40 sec. at 72°C ; and final
extension at 72°C for 5 min. Finally, PCR products were
subjected to a re-annealing process to enable heteroduplex
formation: 95 °C for 10 min, 95°C to 85 °C ramping at
−2 °C/s, 85 °C to 25 °C at −0.25 °C/s, and 16°C hold
for 10 min. After re-annealing, products were treated with
T7 nuclease for 1.5h, and analyzed by gel electrophoresis.
Quantification was based on relative band intensities.
Indel percent was determined by the formula, 100×(1−(1−
(b+c)/(a+b+c))1/2), where a is the integrated intensity of
the undigested PCR product, b and c are the integrated
intensities of each cleavage product.

NOD/SCID mice were obtained from the Animal
Center of the Chinese Academy of Medical Science
(Beijing, China). For generation of xenografts, 2×106
T24 WT, T24 Mut, T24 Mut shCtrl, T24 Mut shGATA4,
T24 Mut shETS1 and T24 Mut Double sh were injected
subcutaneously into the NOD/SCID mice (n=5). Five
days later, the mice were grouped and administered
intraperitoneally with DMSO or epirubicin at a dose of
2 mg/kg two times per week for 30 days. The volume
of xenografts was measured every five days. Mice were
sacrificed after 30 days. Animal work was permitted by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of
the Institute of Biophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences
and conducted in accordance with its recommendations
and ethical regulations.

Statistical analysis
Student’s t-test was used as statistical analysis by
