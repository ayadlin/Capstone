Trends in the Use of Implantable Accelerated
Partial Breast Irradiation Therapy for Early
Stage Breast Cancer in the United States
Andrea M. Abbott, MD; Elizabeth B. Habermann, PhD, MPH; and Todd M. Tuttle, MD, MS

BACKGROUND: In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an implantable balloon catheter that delivers
accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS). The objective of the current study was to
determine the use of implantable APBI (IAPBI) in the United States and factors associated with IAPBI use. METHODS: By
using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database, the authors conducted a retrospective analysis of
patients who received whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) or IAPBI after BCS for ductal carcinoma in situ, AJCC
stage I, or stage II breast cancer from 2000 to 2007. WBRT and IAPBI rates were determined across time and demographic and tumor factors using chi-square tests and Cochran-Armitage tests for trend for the unadjusted analyses.
RESULTS: A total of 127,257 patients who met inclusion criteria were identified. Over the study period, the proportion
of patients receiving IAPBI increased by 1600% (from 0.4% in 2000 to 6.8% in 2007; P <.001). This trend remained
significant when using logistic regression (odds ratio, 20.3; 95% confidence interval, 15.5-26.6). The increase in IAPBI
use was statistically significant across all stage and age categories >40 years (P <.001). The use of IAPBI was most
notable in older women (ages 70-79 years), with a >2100% increase in use noted during the study period (0.4% in
2000 vs 9.0% in 2007; P <.001). The authors also found significant variation in IAPBI use by region. CONCLUSIONS:
IAPBI use has markedly increased since 2000, particularly in the elderly population. The rapid and widespread adoption of IAPBI is concerning, because large multicenter randomized controlled trials have not yet demonstrated the

Investigators from the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project Trial (NSABP) B-06 reported in
1985 that survival after breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and whole-breast radiotherapy (WBRT) was equivalent to that of
mastectomy.1 The National Institutes of Health then released a consensus statement in 1990 stating that BCS and WBRT
was the preferred treatment for patients with early stage breast cancer.2 As a result, the practice patterns in the United
States changed dramatically, and BCS rates markedly increased.3 The benefit of WBRT has been established by several
randomized trials that have demonstrated that local recurrence rates are higher in patients treated with BCS alone compared with BCS plus WBRT.1,4,5
Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) may offer an alternative method of radiation delivery that is given
directly to the tumor bed and in a shorter course of therapy. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved the use of a single balloon implantable catheter, MammoSite (Hologic, Bedford, Mass), for use in APBI therapy.
The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) and the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) support
the use of APBI in select patients with invasive ductal cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).6-8 The indications for
APBI are evolving and are not uniform across oncology fields. The ASBS uses criteria based on guidelines from the American Brachytherapy Society and ASTRO’s guidelines are based on recommendations from a task force review of the APBI
literature.8-10 A recent publication by Shaitelman et al determined that when the ASTRO guidelines were retrospectively
applied to patients treated in the ASBS MammoSite Registry Trial, no subgroup of patients was found to have an
increased rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR).11

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Database
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)
database was used to evaluate rates and trends of WBRT
and IAPBI use in the United States from 2000 through
2007. The SEER cancer registries provide populationbased cancer surveillance for 17 areas that represent
approximately 26% of the United States.12 SEER collects
information regarding patient, tumor, and treatment
characteristics including age; race; marital status; tumor
grade, stage, and histology; receipt and type of radiotherapy administered; and type of surgery received.
Study Cohort
This study evaluated women who underwent BCS and
RT for the treatment of breast cancer. Women with a diagnosis of DCIS, AJCC stage I, or stage II breast cancer,
who were aged >18 years, with no prior history of cancer,
including breast cancer, were eligible for the study.
Radiation categories were limited to beam radiation or
radioactive implants. Women with grade 4 tumors were
excluded from the study because of the low frequency of
this diagnosis and the concern that it may represent a metastatic nonbreast malignancy. Patients who received
radioisotopes, combination therapy, or an unspecified
type of RT were excluded from the analysis.
Statistical Analysis
We evaluated rates of WBRT and IAPBI across patient
and tumor factors using chi-square tests. We calculated
the percentage increase of IAPBI use from 2000 through
2007 using the Cochran-Armitage test for trend. We constructed a logistic regression model to compare the odds
of receiving IAPBI versus WBRT for each year (20012007) compared with 2000. Logistic regression was also
used to evaluate for predictors of IAPBI therapy including
age, race, marital status, stage of disease, and registry, controlling for patients’ age, race, marital status, disease stage,
and registry as potential confounders.
All statistical analyses were completed using SAS statistical software (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc, Cary,
NC). This study was exempt from review by the Human
Subjects Committee of the University of Minnesota’s

RESULTS
We identified 127,257 patients who met inclusion criteria during the study period. On bivariate analysis, we
found significant differences between patients who
received WBRT compared with patients who received
IAPBI. Patients differed with regard to age, race, stage of
disease, and marital status. Women in the IAPBI treatment group were more likely to be older, widowed, and
have stage I disease. Whites were the predominant race
in both groups and African Americans were equally
represented (Table 1). We also found variation by geographic location. Only 0.5% of women treated with RT
in Hawaii received IAPBI, whereas 7.2% of women in
metropolitan Atlanta were treated with IAPBI.
The proportion of patients receiving IAPBI
increased by 1600% (0.4% in 2000 vs 6.8% in 2007; P <
.001), whereas the proportion of patients receiving
WBRT decreased (99.6% in 2000 vs 93.2% in 2007;
P < .001) (Fig. 1). Use of IAPBI increased among all
age groups >40 years during the study period (P < .001)
(Fig. 2). Although the P value for the age category 18
through 39 years approached statistical significance (P ¼

.051), only 25 patients were treated with IAPBI between
2000 and 2007 in this age group. The most notable
increase in IAPBI use was among patients aged >80 years
(0.85% in 2000 vs 9.61% in 2007; P <.001). Patients
with stage I disease represented the largest group of
patients who received IAPBI (3.5%; P <.001). The use of
IAPBI increased among women with DCIS, stage I, and
stage II breast cancer from 2000 through 2007 (P <.001).
We used logistic regression analysis to evaluate several patient and tumor characteristics as predictors of the
receipt of IAPBI therapy (vs WBRT) while adjusting for
potential confounders (Table 2). Trends in IAPBI use
remained significant (odds ratio [OR], 20.3 for 2007 vs
2000; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 15.5-26.6),
and older age continued to be a predictor of use. Patients
aged >80 years were more likely than younger patients to
receive IAPBI (OR, 7.1 for age 80 years vs 18-39 years;

95% CI, 4.6-10.7). Race was also found to be a significant
predictor: white women were more likely to receive IAPBI
compared with African American women (OR, 1.3; 95%
CI, 1.1-1.5). Women who were separated, divorced, or
whose marital status was unknown were more likely than
single women to receive IAPBI (OR, 1.2 for separated/
divorced/unknown vs single; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4). Married
or widowed women were not found to be more likely than
single women to be treated with IAPBI.
Patients with DCIS or stage I disease were more
likely than patients with stage II disease to be treated with
IAPBI (DCIS vs stage II: OR, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.7-2.2];
stage I vs stage II: OR, 3.1 [95% CI, 2.8-3.5]). We did
find geographic variation with IAPBI use (Table 3). For
example, patients in Atlanta were more likely than
patients in Hawaii to receive IAPBI (OR, 10.5 for Atlanta
vs Hawaii; 95% CI, 6.2-17.6).

DISCUSSION
The results from the current study demonstrate that
IAPBI use dramatically increased in the United States
from 2000 through 2007. This increase occurred among
women of all ages, but was statistically significant in
women aged >40 years and most notable in women aged
>80 years. Disease stage, marital status, race, and geographic location were also found to be significant

predictors of receipt of IAPBI therapy. The findings of the
current study indicate that IAPBI use is becoming a more
widely used treatment modality for women who have
undergone BCS.
Despite the demonstrated efficacy of WBRT after
BCS, recent studies have found that an increasing number
of women are not receiving WBRT after BCS.13,14 The
results of a study conducted by Freedman et al indicated
that the rates of WBRT after BCS are decreasing in the
United States (79.4% in 1988 vs 66.4% in 2004;
P < .001).14 The reasons for the omission of WBRT after
BCS are not entirely clear. The current schedule of daily
WBRT for 6 weeks most likely contributes to the
observed trends. Transportation to and from treatments,
as well as the time needed to receive the radiation, may be
difficult for some patients, particularly elderly or
employed women. It has been demonstrated that patients
who live far distances from RT centers are less likely to
receive WBRT after BCS.15 Because of the complex multidisciplinary nature of breast cancer treatment, patient
handoffs between surgeons, medical oncologists, and radiation oncologists may not occur smoothly. Finally, many
patients may simply overestimate the frequency and severity of WBRT side effects.
Alternative strategies to deliver RT may ensure
adequate local treatment after BCS. Hypofractionated RT
delivered over 3 weeks, compared with 6 weeks, represents
an attractive alternative to WBRT after BCS. Whelan et al
reported the results of a clinical trial in which women with

3308

lymph node-negative breast cancer were randomized to
traditional WBRT (50 grays [Gy] in 25 fractions over 35
days) or hypofractionated RT (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions
over 22 days) after BCS; local recurrence rates at 10 years
were not found to be significantly different between the 2
groups.16 APBI is another method of delivering RT that
may increase compliance rates because of its targeted
effects directly to the tumor bed and a shorter course of
therapy. Several methods of delivering APBI are available,
including balloon implantable catheters, interstitial
brachytherapy, 3-dimensional (3-D) conformal RT, and
intraoperative RT (IORT). The implantable balloon devices are placed directly into the tumor bed at the time of
BCS or shortly thereafter. The interstitial method involves
the insertion of several afterloading catheters through the
skin and into the tumor cavity. IORT is administered after surgical resection as a single-fraction targeted dose to
the site of the tumor. Currently, an international phase 3
prospective randomized trial, TARGIT (Targeted IntraOperative Radiation Therapy), is evaluating the efficacy
of IORT compared with WBRT in the control of local recurrence rates.17,18 Implantable balloon catheters are
most likely the most commonly used method of IAPBI in
clinical practice in the United States. Hologic estimates
that >50,000 women to date have been treated with
MammoSite.19 Although other balloon devices, such as
Contura (SenoRx Inc, Irvine, Calif), have also been
approved by the FDA, to our knowledge MammoSite is
the most well-studied and most likely the most frequently
used balloon catheter for IAPBI.
Several single- and multi-institution studies have
evaluated the effectiveness of the MammoSite device. A
prospective study conducted by Benitez et al reported no
local or regional recurrences among the 36 patients with
early stage breast cancer who were followed for a median
of 5.5 years. Cosmetic outcomes of good to excellent were
reported in 83.3% of these patients.20 Chao et al followed
80 patients for a median of 22.1 months after BCS and
treatment with MammoSite and reported that 2 patients
(2.5%) developed IBTR. Cosmetic outcomes were favorable, with 88.2% of patients reporting good to excellent
outcomes at 36 months.21 To the best of our knowledge,
the ASBS MammoSite brachytherapy registry is the largest cohort reported in the literature. At 3 years of followup on the entire cohort, the IBTR rate was 2.15%. An
additional year of follow-up on the first 400 patients
revealed an IBTR rate of 2.65%.22 Cosmetic outcomes
and complication rates were similar to other published
results with IAPBI use. Although these reports indicate

outcomes comparable to WBRT, the large multicentered
randomized clinical trials with long-term follow-up are
not yet available.
Currently, the NSABP/Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) is conducting a randomized clinical
trial to evaluate the effectiveness of APBI in women
treated with BCS. In NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413, women
are randomized to WBRT or 1 of 3 methods of APBI:
multicatheter, MammoSite balloon catheter, or 3-D conformal RT. Women with DCIS, stage I, or stage II disease
are eligible for enrollment. The results from this study
may establish APBI as a safe and effective alternative to
WBRT.
We acknowledge some limitations to the current
study. Detailed patient and tumor information that may
have influenced treatment decisions was not available
from the cancer registry database. Important factors
regarding family history, genetic testing results, tamoxifen
use, systemic chemotherapy, and mammographic findings
were not available from this database. In addition, the
SEER registry classifications of RT are limited to beam
radiation, radioactive implants, radioisotopes, combination therapy, radiation not otherwise specified, other, and
unknown. Although we can not be absolutely certain, radioactive implants in the form of balloon catheter therapy,
specifically MammoSite, most likely represented the most
commonly used method of IABPI in our population during the study period. SEER does not record the number of
radiation treatments received so we were unable to determine whether patients received a full course of RT. By
eliminating the radiation category of combination therapy
we may be missing patients who did not tolerate WBRT
and were then offered IAPBI, and, in fact, under-reporting the true rate of IAPBI. In addition, data analysis in
SEER relies on accurate coding of procedures. During the
early use of the implantable balloon catheters, some cases
may have been coded under a different radiation category
instead of radioactive implants, again resulting in an
underestimation of the true increase in IAPBI use.
Conclusions
The rate of IAPBI therapy is increasing in the United
States, whereas the rate of WBRT is decreasing. IAPBI
may be a favorable alternative to WBRT with a shorter
course of therapy, acceptable cosmesis, and low complication rates. However, the follow-up data regarding recurrence rates are still premature and cannot be adequately
compared with traditional WBRT. Until the release of
NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413, clinicians should be encour-
