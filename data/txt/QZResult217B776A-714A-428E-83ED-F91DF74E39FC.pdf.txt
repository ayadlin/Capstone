ABSTRACT
We carried out a mutational analysis of 3,594 genes coding for cell surface proteins
(Surfaceome) in 23 colorectal cancer cell lines, searching for new altered pathways,
druggable mutations and mutated epitopes for targeted therapy in colorectal cancer.
A total of 3,944 somatic non-synonymous substitutions and 595 InDels, occurring in
2,061 (57%) Surfaceome genes were catalogued. We identified 48 genes not previously
described as mutated in colorectal tumors in the TCGA database, including genes that
are mutated and expressed in >10% of the cell lines (SEMA4C, FGFRL1, PKD1, FAM38A,
WDR81, TMEM136, SLC36A1, SLC26A6, IGFLR1). Analysis of these genes uncovered
important roles for FGF and SEMA4 signaling in colorectal cancer with possible
therapeutic implications. We also found that cell lines express on average 11 druggable
mutations, including frequent mutations (>20%) in the receptor tyrosine kinases AXL
and EPHA2, which have not been previously considered as potential targets for colorectal
cancer. Finally, we identified 82 cell surface mutated epitopes, however expression of
only 30% of these epitopes was detected in our cell lines. Notwithstanding, 92% of
these epitopes were expressed in cell lines with the mutator phenotype, opening new
venues for the use of “general” immune checkpoint drugs in this subset of patients.

course of their disease. Unfortunately, only a minority of
the patients with metastatic disease is amenable to curative
resection and remains free of disease recurrence [1]. Even
though survival for patients with unresectable metastatic
colorectal cancer has improved over the past decade,
due to the introduction of agents targeting the Epidermal
Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) and the Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), these treatments
are often not curative, and intrinsic and acquired drug
resistance is frequently observed in the clinical practice
[2]. Therefore, the identification of altered pathways
and new therapeutic targets is critical to improve the
management of a significant proportion of colorectal
cancer patients.
Genetic analysis of colorectal tumors over the
past 30 years allowed the characterization of distinct
molecular pathways altered during the development
and progression of this disease [3]. Initial whole-exome
screenings using colorectal cancer cell lines detected an
average of 80 point mutations in coding regions of the
genome and a small number of frequently mutated cancer
genes [4]. More recently, in a major effort to dissect the
genetic basis of colorectal cancer, the TCGA released the
results of a comprehensive and integrated genome-scale
analysis of 276 tumors. No significant genetic differences
were observed between rectal and colon tumors, and
twenty–four genes were identified as frequently mutated
in colorectal cancer, including several novel cancer genes
such as SOX9, ARID1A, ATM, TCF7L2 and FAM123B.
Most importantly, new potentially druggable targets
were identified, including amplifications in the ERBB2
and IGF2 genes [5]. Despite this massive sequencing
effort, a recent mutation saturation analysis of 4,742
tumors, across 21 cancer types, revealed that the cancer
gene catalogue is far from complete, and that many more
mutated genes with putative druggable mutations remain
to be discovered [6].
Cell surface proteins are involved in a variety of
cellular functions, including nutrient and ion transport,
adhesion and signaling. These proteins also play important
roles in pathological conditions such as diabetes,
neurological disorders and cancer. They represent
approximately 18% of all protein-coding genes in the
human genome [7] and, due to their accessibility on the
cell surface, they constitute optimal targets for directed
therapies [8]. We have recently generated a catalog
of genes coding for transmembrane proteins located
at the surface of human cells (Surfaceome), and by
integrating publically available gene expression data from
a variety of sources, we searched for altered pathways,
new therapeutic targets and tumor antigens in gliomas,
colorectal and breast tumors [9, 10]. In the present work,
we carried out a systematic mutational analysis of the
Surfaceome in a panel of 23 representative colorectal
cancer cell lines, searching for novel altered pathways,
druggable mutations and mutated epitopes for targeted

therapy in colorectal cancer. Collectively, our results point
towards the potential use of FDA (U.S. Food and Drug
Administration) approved RTK inhibitors and immune
checkpoint target drugs in specific subsets of colorectal
cancer patients.

RESULTS
Targeted sequencing the Surfaceome in
colorectal cancer
We have recently used a combined bioinformatics
approach to generate a catalog of genes coding for
transmembrane proteins located on the surface of
human cells [9]. Briefly, we searched the complete
set of protein-coding genes for an annotated and/or
predicted transmembrane domain and eliminated false
positive candidates containing a signal peptide or known
to be located on the membrane of other intracellular
compartments. An updated list of genes coding for
cell surface proteins was generated for this study
(Supplementary information Table S1).
To define the mutational profile of the Surfaceome
in colorectal cancer, we target sequenced the coding
regions of the 3,594 cell surface protein genes in a panel of
23 tumor cell lines (Supplementary information Table S2)
that altogether are representative of the main subtypes
of primary colorectal tumors at the genomic level [11].
A total of 33,405 exons, covering ~6Mb of the human
genome, were screened for the presence of somatic point
mutations (nucleotide non-synonymous substitutions and
InDels). For each cell line we analyzed approximately 1.2
Gb of on target sequences, with an average coverage of
30X (Table 1).

Somatic mutations in the colorectal
cancer Surfaceome
Somatic point mutations were detected using an in
house computational pipeline based on SAMtools mpileup
calling (Figure 1). As matched normal tissue for these cell
lines was not available, putative somatic mutations were
identified by annotation against databases of known human
germline variants (Table 2). A total of 3,944 putative
somatic non-synonymous substitutions and 595 InDels
were catalogued affecting 2,061 (57%) Surfaceome genes
(Supplementary information Table S3). We identified an
average of 174 putative non-synonymous substitutions and
28 InDels per cell line (Table 2). Mutation rates for genes
coding for cell surface proteins varied significantly across
cell lines and were similar to those previously reported
for the entire set of protein-coding genes in colorectal
tumors (Table 2) [5]. As expected, higher mutation rates
(mutator phenotype) were observed in cell lines with
microsatellite instability (MSI) and mutations in the

A total of 184 (5%) putative non-synonymous
substitutions were nonsense, and 529 (89%) of the InDels
introduced a frame-shift alteration in the mutated protein
(Table 2 and Supplementary information Table S4). To
further identify substitutions that may impact protein
function, we used three different algorithms (PolyPhen,
SIFT and Mutation Assessor) to estimate the impact of
amino acid substitutions using information from DNA
sequence, evolutionary conservation and structural
data. A total of 1,434 (36%) putative non-synonymous
substitutions and 474 (80%) InDels were classified as
having an impact on protein function, and colorectal

To further address the biological significance of
the uncovered point mutations, we have incorporated
gene expression data available for the cell lines (RNAseq
and microarray) and restricted our downstream analysis
to mutated and expressed genes. A list of genes coding
for cell surface proteins that are mutated and expressed
in >10% of the 23 cell lines analyzed is provided in

Figure 1: Sequencing strategy and computational pipeline used for the detection of somatic point mutations in the
Surfaceome of colorectal cancer cell lines. The coding regions of 3,594 cell surface proteins were screened for the presence of somatic
point mutations in 23 colorectal cancer cell lines. Genomic sequences were generated using either a SOLiD4 or a HiSeq 2000 sequencing
platform. Sequences were aligned against the human genome reference sequence (GRCh37/hg19) using Bioscope and NovoAlign CS for
SOLiD4 sequences and BWA for HiSeq 2000 sequences. Variant calling was performed using samtools mpileup and requiring at least 3
high quality reads (Q≥25; q≥20) on both strands supporting the variant. Known germline polymorphisms were removed and recurrent
mutations were manually inspected to remove alignment artifacts. SIFT, PolyPhen-2 and Mutation Assessor were used to predict the
functional impact of non-synonymous substitutions on protein function. RANKPEP and NetMHC were used for epitope prediction. Gene
expression data was obtained from RNASeq (FPKM>3) or microarray (hybridization intensity≥5.5) experiments.

mutations in genes belonging to pathways known to be
involved in colorectal cancer, including the WNT (LRP5
and FZD10), TGFβ (TGFBR3 and ACVR1B) and RTKRas (EGFR and ERBB3) signaling pathways [5]. Our
analysis also identified 48 expressed genes that were not
previously described as mutated in primary colorectal
tumors in the TCGA database [5] (Supplementary
information Table S7). This list includes mutations in 9
genes (SEMA4C, FGFRL1, PKD1, FAM38A, WDR81,

in >10% of the cell lines and were confirmed by Sanger

Semaphorin 4C (SEMA4C) mutations were detected

(HCT15, KM12, RW2982, T84). Two of these mutations
occur in the SEMA domain, a highly conserved sequence
of approximately 500 amino acids critical for inducing
targets of Semaphorin signaling. A third mutation occurs
in the plexin-semaphorin-integrin (PSI) domain, another
highly conserved domain, enriched in cysteine residues
(Figure 2). Recurrent mutations in other genes belonging
to the Semaphorin signaling pathway were also observed,
including frequent mutations (>20%) in SEMA4G and

conserved family of proteins that have been initially
implicated in nervous system development and, more
recently, in cancer progression and tumor angiogenesis
[12, 13]. SEMA4C expression is significantly downregulated during stem cell differentiation [14] and plays an
important role in TGFβ-1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal
transition [15]. To date, there is no published evidence
of the direct involvement of SEMA4C in cancer, but
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

somatic point mutations in SEMA4C were also reported
by TCGA in 4% of the cutaneous melanomas. Conversely,
an important role of the SEMA4D-Plexin-B1 interaction
in regulating different aspects of tumor progression and
angiogenesis is well established [16]. In all, alterations in
SEMA4 family members were detected in 56% (13/23)
of the cell lines, indicating an important role of SEMA4
signaling in colorectal cancer.

in colorectal cancer cell lines. Known protein domains are represented using different colors. Somatic point mutations occurring in
different colorectal cancer cell lines are indicated (▼) and highlighted in red when predicted to have an impact on protein function.

Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Like Protein 1
(FGFRL1) alterations were detected and validated
by Sanger sequencing in 4 cell lines (LOVO, KM12,
LIM1215, RKO). Three cell lines carry frameshift
mutations and the remaining cell line carries a nonsynonymous point mutation with a predicted damaging
effect, indicating a loss of function of the FGFRL1
protein in colorectal cancer (Figure 2). Recurrent (>10%)
FGFRL1 somatic mutations were also reported in bladder
tumors [17]. FGFRL1 acts as a negative regulator of
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) signaling
either by interfering with FGFR1 dimerization and
phosphorylation or by sequestering FGFR1 ligands
[18]. FGFR1 amplification and overexpression has been
reported in colorectal cancer and associated with the
presence of liver metastasis [19]. Indeed, in our study we
also detected and validated by Sanger sequencing somatic
mutations in FGFR1 in 4 cell lines (HCT116, HCT15,
RKO, SW48), including a non-synonymous substitution
in the tyrosine kinase domain (Figure 2). Mutations in
FGFR2 (LIM2405) and FGFR3 (LOVO, SW48) were also
observed at a lower frequency. In all, alterations in FGFR
family members were detected in 35% (8/23) of the cell
lines, suggesting an important role of FGF signaling in
colorectal cancer.
Although the remaining 7 genes (PKD1, FAM38A,
WDR81, TMEM136, SLC36A1, SLC26A6, IGFLR1)
are mutated in >10% of the colorectal cancer cell
lines, literature searches did not reveal evidence of the
functional role or therapeutic potential of these genes
in colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, recurrent mutations
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(>3%) in FAM38A, SLC36A1 and WDR81 have been
reported for other primary tumors in the TCGA database,
and further functional studies will be necessary to address
their involvement in colorectal tumorigenesis.

Druggable mutations in cell surface proteins for
targeted therapy in colorectal cancer
In order to identify putative druggable mutations
in cell surface proteins, we searched for mutated genes
present in the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb),
which integrates drug-target information from 13
different sources, including the literature and previously
established databases [20]. We generated a catalogue of
point mutations in druggable genes, and we found that
colorectal cell lines harbor on average 11 mutations in
druggable expressed genes (Table 3 and Supplementary
information Table S8).
A significant fraction (34%) of these mutations
occurred in membrane transporters. Membrane
transporters, including solute carriers (SLCs) and ABC
transporters, control the uptake and efflux of amino acids,
sugars, lipids and vitamins, and their expression and
activity are frequently altered in cancer as a consequence
of the higher energy and nutritional requirements of
the tumor cells [21]. Membrane transporters represent
potential targets for cancer therapy and blocking their
activity could be one way to interfere with tumor
progression. In addition, membrane transporters can also
serve as chemo-sensitizing targets, since they actively
participate in drug delivery and resistance [21, 22].
9205

Oncotarget

Mutations in ABCA3, ABCA7, ABCC1, SLC23A2 and
SLC9A1 were each observed in >20% of the cell lines.
We then focused on expressed genes with putative
druggable mutations that were not previously considered
as potential therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer,
but for which specific inhibitors have previously been
developed. We particularly focused on surface proteins
with kinase activity, as they represent a significant fraction
of the genes mutated in cancer and are highly amenable to
targeting by rationally designed small molecule inhibitors.
Two druggable RTKs (AXL and EPHA2) were found to be
frequently (>20%) altered in our cell lines.
Five point mutations in the kinase domain and/or
with predicted functional impact in the AXL Receptor
Tyrosine Kinase (AXL) were detected and validated
by Sanger Sequencing in 22% (5/23) of our cell lines
(COLO205, KM12, HCT116, HCT15 and LOVO)
(Figure 2). One of these mutations (g.chr19:41726597
C>T) occurring in the GAS6-ligand binding domain was
also observed in a uterine corpus endometrioid carcinoma
and in a glioblastoma. AXL is a member of the TAM
family of RTKs, which also includes Mer and Tyro-3
[23]. Mutations in Mer (SW48) and Tyro-3 (HCT15)
were also observed. Point mutations in AXL have not
been specifically described in the literature for colorectal
cancer, and lower mutation frequencies (3.5%) were
reported for primary colorectal cancers in the TCGA
database [5]. Overexpression of AXL in colorectal tumors
was reported in metastatic lesions [24] and AXL was
recently characterized as a poor prognostic marker in early
stage colorectal tumors, and as an important mediator of
basal and 5-FU induced EMT and invasiveness [25].
Point mutations in the EPH Receptor A2 gene
(EPHA2) were detected and validated by Sanger
sequencing in 3 cell lines (HCT15, LIM1215, LIM2405).
Three of these mutations are located in the tyrosine
kinase domain and one in the Ephrin-ligand binding
domain (Figure 2). Mutations with predicted functional
impact in the Ephrin-ligand binding domain and in the
tyrosine kinase domain of the EPHA1 gene were also
observed in 3 cell lines (HCT15, LIM1215 and LOVO)
(Figure 2). Point mutations in EPHA2 and EPHA1
have not been specifically described in the literature for
primary colorectal tumors, and lower mutation frequencies
for these genes (4.4% EPHA1 and 2.6% EPHA2) were
reported for primary colorectal tumors in the TCGA
database [5]. EPHA2 is overexpressed in tumor cells and
in tumor blood vessels in different types of cancer [26]. In
colorectal tumors, EPHA2 overexpression was detected in
approximately half of the samples and higher expression
was associated with advanced stage tumors, metastatic
disease and higher microvessels counts [27, 28]. Moreover,
loss of EPHA2 reduced tumor formation in Apc Min/+
mice [29]. Conversely, elevated levels of EPHA1 were
observed in early stage compared to late stage colorectal
tumors. Reduced EPHA1 expression was associated with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

poorly differentiated and invasive tumors and poor overall
survival, indicating that EPHA1 may play different roles
during different stages of colorectal carcinoma progression
[30, 31].

Mutated epitopes exposed on the cell surface of
colorectal cancer
Non-synonymous and frameshift mutations in the
Surfaceome of the 23 colorectal cancer cell lines were
used to identify mutated epitopes with differential binding
affinity to HLA when compared to epitopes generated by
the corresponding non-mutated (reference) sequences.
Our local pipeline for immunogenic epitope prediction
was based on two algorithms RANKPEP and NetMHC
as described in Materials and Methods. Mutated epitopes
were required to have a binding affinity to the HLA*0201
molecule that was at least 20% higher than the reference
epitope as predicted by both algorithms. A total of 82
putative mutated epitopes were identified (73  epitopes
from non-synonymous mutations and 9 epitopes from
frameshift mutations). However, when we combined
gene expression data with epitope prediction analysis,
we found that only 30% (25/82) of the predicted epitopes
are expressed, and that 92% (23/25) of these epitopes are
expressed in a subset of the cell lines with the mutator
phenotype. These results suggest that the use of potentially
immunogenic mutations in cell surface proteins for
personalized T-cell based immunotherapy in colorectal
cancer is limited, as only 30% of the mutated epitopes
are expressed and less than half (11/23) of the tumors cell
lines express mutated epitopes.

Discussion and Therapeutic Implications
One of the major objectives of cancer genome
sequencing projects is to identify therapeutically targetable
mutations. This objective has been achieved with repeated
success in cancer therapy, resulting in the introduction of
new treatment protocols in the clinical practice. The use
of Imatinib, for chronic myeloid leukemia and other solid
tumors, of Trastuzumab and Lapatinib, for ERBB2 positive
breast cancer, and of Vemurafenib, for BRAF mutant
melanomas, are emblematic examples of how genomic
alterations can be used to target cancer cells [32]. Over
the past years, these sequencing projects have revealed
many new cancer genes, most of which are mutated at
intermediate frequencies (2–20%) or lower, uncovering
an unprecedented level of genetic heterogeneity in human
cancers and establishing the need for a continued effort to
determine the functional significance of these mutations
and to translate these findings to the bedside [33].
Cell surface proteins constitute optimal targets for
directed therapies and represent two-thirds of the proteinbased drug targets [34, 35]. Surface proteins are also
excellent targets for antibody-based therapies and vaccine

development since they are exposed on the cell surface
and, therefore, have the highest chances to be recognized
as antigens [36]. In the present work, we carried out a
systematic mutational analysis of human genes coding
for cell surface proteins, aiming to uncover novel altered
pathways, druggable mutations and mutated epitopes for
targeted therapy in colorectal cancer. We target sequenced
the coding regions of cell surface protein genes in a panel
of 23 tumor cell lines that altogether are representative
of the main subtypes of primary colorectal tumors at
the genomic level [11]. We opted to use cell lines in this
study, instead of primary tumors, to overcome limitations
imposed by the high level of colorectal intratumoral
genetic heterogeneity in the mutation detection efficiency
and to have straightforward cell models to further address
the therapeutic potential of the uncovered altered pathways
and druggable mutations.
We found that a significant (57%) fraction of the
Surfaceome is reshaped by somatic point mutations
in colorectal cancer cell lines. Our analysis identified
48 genes coding for cell surface proteins that were not
previously described as mutated in primary colorectal
tumors in the TCGA database [5], including mutations in
SEMA4C and FGFRL1 which have not been previously
considered as potential therapeutic targets for colorectal
cancer. Although we cannot exclude the possibility
that some of these alterations correspond to mutations
acquired during in vitro propagation of the cell lines, our
results are in agreement with a recent mutation saturation
analysis of 4,742 sequenced tumors, across 21 cancer
types [6]. This study revealed that the discovery of cancer
genes mutated at frequencies of 5–10% in colorectal
tumors is increasing linearly in relation to the number of
tumor genomes sequenced, and that the current collection
of sequenced colorectal tumors lacks the desired power
to detect genes mutated at frequencies of 5% above the
background rate [6].
SEMA4C mutations were found in 17% of the
cell lines and recurrent mutations in SEMA4G (17%)
and SEMA4D (22%) were also observed. The effects
of Semaphorins and their receptors in cancer are broad,
context dependent and complex [37]. SEMA4C is
expressed in neural stem cells and its expression is
downregulated during stem cell differentiation [14].
SEMA4C expression is induced by TGFβ-1 in renal
epithelial cells and plays and important role in TGFβ1 induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition [15]. In
addition, an important role of SEMA4D-Plexin-B1
interaction in regulating different aspects leading to tumor
progression, including invasive growth and angiogenesis,
is well established [16]. The pro-angiogenic effect of
SEMA4D was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo
and is comparable to that elicited by other well-known
angiogenic molecules, such as VEGF-A, HGF and bFGF
[38, 39]. Our results suggest that SEMA4 signaling is
activated by point mutations in a significant fraction
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of colorectal tumors, and although specific inhibitors
targeting SEMA4 proteins are not currently available,
several biological process driven by SEMA4 signaling,
such as angiogenesis and invasiveness, could be targeted
with FDA approved drugs, including anti-angiogenic
agents and MET inhibitors.
Inactivating mutations in FGFRL1, the most recently
discovered member of the FGFR family, were detected in
17% of our cell lines. FGFRL1 binds with high affinity
to heparin and FGF ligands, but it does not possess an
intracellular protein kinase domain and, therefore, cannot
signal by trans-auto-phosphorylation [18]. FGFRL1 thus
acts as a negative regulator of FGFR1 signaling and loss
of function mutations described here may represent a
novel mechanism of FGF signaling activation in colorectal
cancer. Alterations in FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3 were
also observed at a lower frequency, and 35% of the cell
lines harbored somatic mutations in members of the FGF
signaling pathway. Different FGFR specific inhibitors are
currently under development [40], and further evaluation
of their activity in the subset of colorectal cancer with
FGFR/FGFRL1 alterations should be pursued. Moreover,
Regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor that targets FGFR1
among other RTKs, was recently approved by the FDA
for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer [41],
but predictive biomarkers for this indication are not yet
currently available.
Higher mutation frequencies in the RTKs AXL
(22%) and EPHA2 (17%) were detected in our panel
compared to those reported in the TCGA database for
primary colorectal tumors (3.51% AXL and 2.63%
EPHA2) [5]. Both RTKs have not been considered as
potential therapeutic targets for colorectal cancer, however
the availability of specific inhibitors and pre-clinical data
support their potential use for therapeutic intervention.
The oncogenic properties of AXL were initially described
in patients with chronic myelogenous and lymphoblastic
leukemia (CML), but overexpression of AXL have also
been detected in many solid tumors and associated with
poor prognosis [23]. AXL has a well established oncogenic
role in survival, proliferation and migration of cancer cells
in vitro, as well as in tumor angiogenesis and metastasis
in vivo [23]. Moreover, recent studies have uncovered
a major role of AXL in primary and acquired resistance
to several anticancer therapies. AXL overexpression has
been linked to Imatinib-resistance in gastrointestinal
stromal tumors [42], Nilotinib-resistance in CML [43] and
Lapatinib-resistance in HER-2 positive breast tumor cells
[44]. In lung cancer, AXL was identified as a potential
target for overcoming EGFR inhibitor resistance and
combination of an AXL specific inhibitor (SGI-7079)
with Erlotinib reversed Erlotinib resistance in a xenograft
model of mesenchymal non-small cell lung cancer [45].
In colorectal cancer, AXL expression is associated
to increased invasiveness of tumor cell lines with
overexpression of the chemokine receptors CXCR4
9207

Oncotarget

and CXCR7, and AXL knock-down in these cell
lines significantly hampered tumor cell invasion [46].
Considering that many multi-kinase inhibitors under
development have AXL as one of their targets, further
exploration of the pharmacologic inhibition of this
pathway in pre-clinical models, including tumor cells lines
with resistance to anti-EGFR drugs, should be pursued.
In addition, monoclonal antibodies and small-molecule
tyrosine kinase inhibitors specifically targeting AXL are
currently in development and their use in colorectal cancer
patients should also be further explored [47]. Noteworthy,
some of the cell lines analyzed herein presented
concomitant mutations in AXL and FGFR or FGFRL1
(HCT116, HCT15, LOVO, KM12), which suggests that
these mutations are not mutually exclusive. In this setting,
it will be important to explore the interdependence of both
pathways, specially considering that some multi-kinase
inhibitors under development are capable of blocking
AXL and FGFR concomitantly [48]. Indeed, combination
of these multi-kinase inhibitors with bevacizumab led to
near total inhibition of tumor growth in colon carcinoma
xenograft models and caused tumor growth arrest in
bevacizumab-resistant tumors [48].
Somatic alterations in EPH receptors were also
frequently observed in our cell lines, including frequent
mutations in EPHA1 and EPHA2. Point mutations in
EPHA2 and EPHA1 have not so far been described
in the literature for colorectal cancer. Nevertheless,
mutations in the kinase domain of EPHA3 was reported
in 5% of colorectal cancer cell lines [49] and EPHA3
was listed among the top 3 cancer genes in a large-scale
screening for somatic mutations in colorectal cancer
[4]. EPH receptors play critical roles in embryonic
development and their expression is frequently altered
in a variety of cancers and tumor cell lines [50]. They
comprise the largest family of RTKs and bind to ephrins
(EFN) available on the surface of neighboring cells.
Unlike others RTKs, EPH-EFN signaling is unique,
since it triggers a bi-directional signal that affects both
receptor and EFN expressing cells [50]. EPH receptors
are thus important mediators of tumor cell interactions
with the tumor stroma and tumor vasculature, and have
been proposed as promising targets for cancer therapy,
since targeting these receptors could simultaneously
inhibit several aspects of tumor progression [26, 50].
EPHA2 overexpression in colorectal cancer is associated
with advanced stage tumors, metastatic disease and
higher microvessel counts [27, 28]. Moreover, loss of
EPHA2 was shown to reduce Apc Min/+ tumorigenesis
[29]. Confirmation of the activation of EPH signaling
mediated by EPHA2 point mutations in colorectal cancer
is of upmost importance considering the availability
of FDA approved drugs targeting this receptor, such
as Dasatinib [51]. In addition, EPHA2-FC soluble
receptors were shown to significantly reduce tumor
volume and overall metastatic burden in pre-clinical
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

models of breast [52] and pancreatic tumors [53], but
have not been evaluated in colorectal cancer models.
Finally, receptor endocytosis promoted by anti-EPHA2
monoclonal antibodies has also been used to reduce
EPHA2 activity and inhibit malignant cell behavior in
vitro [54]. On the other hand, therapies targeting EPHA1
in colorectal cancer should be carefully evaluated since
this gene seems to play different roles during disease
progression [30, 31].
Non-synonymous and frameshift mutations in
tumor cells can generate unique T-cell mutated epitopes
and induce tumor antigen-specific immune response
[55]. There is evidence supporting the efficacy of
vaccination strategies using mutated epitopes [56] and
the use of personalized peptide vaccines and adoptive
T-cell transfer protocols based on patient-specific
mutated epitopes holds great promise in cancer therapy
[57]. Unfortunately, combining epitope prediction
algorithms and gene expression data, we found that the
use of potentially immunogenic mutations in cell surface
proteins for personalized immunotherapy in colorectal
cancer is limited, since the expression of approximately
70% of these epitopes was not detected in the tumor cells.
However, additional studies including mutated epitopes
present in intracellular proteins will be required to further
address the applicability of personalized vaccines in
colorectal patients.
Notwithstanding, we observed that mutated
expressed epitopes are predominantly found in colorectal
cell lines presenting a mutator phenotype and that this
specific subset of cell lines express a total of 23 mutated
epitopes. In this context, it was recently demonstrated
that patients with tumors showing naturally occurring
immunogenic mutations presented higher cytotoxic T-cell
infiltration and improved overall survival and, based on
these observations, the use general immune modulators
that block immune regulatory checkpoints such as antiCTLA4 and anti-PD1 was proposed as a treatment
strategy for patients with immunogenic mutations [58].
Accordingly, tumors with a high level of mutations as
revealed by the TCGA [59], such as melanoma and nonsmall cell lung cancer, are currently deriving striking
benefits with immune checkpoint blockage drugs [60, 61].
Although our results do not support the use of personalized
T-cell based immunotherapy in colorectal cancer, they
suggest that colorectal cancer patients harboring tumors
with a mutator phenotype could be more responsive to
immune checkpoint blockage. Indeed, increased counts
of CD8+ T-cells were observed in colorectal cancer
tumors with high mutational loads [58] and microsatellite
instability [62]. Data on the use of immune checkpoint
target drugs in colorectal cancer are still limited, but the
results of the first long term follow-up study from the
first clinical trial based on the PD1-targeting monoclonal
antibody have recently been reported. This study included
a 71-year-old patient with colorectal cancer who attained
9208

Oncotarget

a complete and durable (>4 years) response to anti-PD1
treatment [63].
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
systematic and focused screen of point mutations in genes
coding for cell surface proteins in colorectal cancer. By
combining high-throughput sequencing, bioinformatics
tools, data integration and literature searches, we have
successfully discovered novel altered pathways and
druggable mutations for targeted therapy in colorectal
cancer. We have also uncovered the potential use of
existing RTK inhibitors and immune checkpoint target
drugs in specific subsets of colorectal cancer patients.
Results presented here are encouraging, however our study
also presents some limitations.
First, although we have described novel druggable
mutations occurring in a representative panel of colorectal
cancer cell lines, it will be important to confirm the
prevalence of these alterations in clinical samples
matched with normal tissue. At present, we cannot
completely exclude the possibility that some of the
alterations reported in this study correspond to mutations
acquired during in vitro propagation of the cell lines or
to very rare germline polymorphisms not represented
in public databases, nor in individuals sequenced
by the 1000 Genomes Project. However, we believe
that these possibilities do not significantly affect our
results, since we have previously shown that the rate of
mutation accumulation during in vitro propagation is not
significant [11] and stringent bioinformatics cut-offs were
implemented to filter most, if not all, non-clonal mutations
eventually introduced during in vitro growth. Second,
the functional consequences of the uncovered genetic
alterations were predicted primarily using computational
tools, and confirmation with functional in vitro assays
is further required. Similarly, additional experiments to
evaluate the effects of pharmacologic inhibition of the
altered pathways using pre-clinical models are compulsory
to translate our findings to the bedside. Finally, although
we suggest potential molecular therapeutic targets in
colon cancer, it is important to recognize that a recent
study matching targeted therapy with specific molecular
abnormalities for patients with advanced colorectal cancer
failed to confer significant clinical benefit [64]. We believe
that a diversification of potential targets, including those
proposed by our study, could bring new opportunities to
change this paradigm.

SW620, SW837, SW948 and T84 were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
LIM1215 and LIM2405 were generated by the Ludwig
Institute for Cancer Research. HCC2998 and KM12 were
obtained from the National Cancer Institute-Frederick
Cancer DCT Tumor Repository. RW2982 and RW7213
were provided by Dr. P Calabresi from Roger Williams
General Hospital. Cells were cultured with Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle Medium and 10% FBS at 37oC and
5% CO2. Cell lines were authenticated and tested for
Mycoplasma contamination as previously described [11].

Target sequencing the human surfaceome
We target-sequenced the coding regions of 3,594
cell surface proteins in 12 cell lines (CACO2, COLO205,
HCT116, HCT15, HT29, RKO, SW480, SW620,
LIM1215, LIM2405, HCC2998, KM12). Surfaceomecapture and sequencing were performed using Sure Select
Target Enrichment baits (Agilent Technologies) and the
SOLiD 4.0 sequencing platform (Life Technologies),
respectively. For the remaining cell lines (COLO320,
LOVO, SKCO1, SW1116, SW403, SW48, SW837,
SW948, T84, RW2982 and RW7213) whole-exome
capture was performed using the TruSeq Exome
Enrichment Kit (Illumina) and paired-end sequencing was
performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000. A local pipeline
was then developed to extract the genomic sequences
corresponding to the Surfaceome targeted region from
whole-exome data.

Public Data and Databases
Exome-capture sequencing data on colorectal tumors
were retrieved from TCGA and used to identify novel
mutated genes and to determine mutation frequencies in
colorectal cancer primary tumors. The DGIdb [20] was
used to identify druggable mutated genes and the gene list
provided by the Human Kinome project [65] (kinase.com/
human/kinome) was used to identify genes coding for cell
surface proteins with kinase activity.

Somatic mutation detection, validation and
functional analysis
For single nucleotide variations (SNVs) detection,
SOLiD 4.0 and Illumina reads were aligned to the
human reference genome sequence (GRCh37/hg19)
using BioScope (Life Technologies) and BWA [66],
respectively. For InDels detection, alignments were
performed using NovoAlignCS (www.novocraft.com). A
local pipeline for point mutations was developed using
Samtools mpileup and bcftools [67]. Duplicated reads
were removed with rmdup (Samtools) to avoid potential
PCR duplicates generated during library construction.
Variants were filtered against known germline variations

annotated in dbSNP (version #135) and variations present
in more than 3 cell lines were manually inspected to
distinguish recurrent mutations (eg. EGFR mutations)
from false positive mutations due to alignment artifacts.
Somatic mutations were validated using PCR amplification
and Sanger sequencing using standard protocols
(Supplementary information Table S9, S10). SIFT [68],
PolyPhen-2 [69] and Mutation Assessor [70] were used
to evaluate the impact of non-synonymous substitutions
and InDels on protein function. Mutations were annotated
as having an impact on protein function when predicted
by at least two of these algorithms in the case of nonsynonymous substitutions and by SIFT in the case of
InDels.

from both algorithms were processed using a local pipeline
and epitopes resulting from sequence concatenation
artifacts were excluded. Mutated epitopes were defined as
those predicted by both algorithms and that were unique to
the variant sequence or showing an increase in MHC biding
affinity by >20% when compared to the reference peptide.

Gene expression data
RNA-Seq data was generated for 12 cell lines
(CACO2, COLO205, COLO320, HCT116, HCT15, HT29,
KM12, LIM1215, LIM2405, RKO, SW480, SW948)

>100 million reads. Sequences were aligned to the human
reference genome sequence (GRCh37/hg19) using TopHat
[71] with standard parameters for color space reads.
Isoform assembly and transcript relative abundance was
determined using Cufflinks [72]. Genes were considered
expressed when FPKM [72, 73] was ≥ 3 in at least one
of the cell lines [73, 74]. For the remaining cell lines
(LOVO, SKCO1, SW1116, SW403, SW48, SW620,
SW837, e T84) microarray expression data was extracted
from GEO [75]; Accession GSE36133) and genes were
considered expressed when the array values were ≥ 5.5.

Epitope prediction
Peptide sequences corresponding to non-synonymous
mutations and InDels, flanked by 10 aminoacids on
either side, were used for epitope prediction by applying
a similar approach to that described by Segal et al.
2008 [76]. The same process was performed for peptide
sequences corresponding to the non-altered (reference)
sequences. Concatamers of these peptides were analyzed
by RANKPEP [77] and NetMHC [78] to identify 9 aa
peptide sequences with binding affinity to the class I MHC
molecule HLA-A*0201. RANKPEP predicts binding based
on scoring matrices from known peptides that bind to
MHC molecules. Peptides were considered immunogenic
if the percentage optimum was ≥ 50%. RANKPEP also
evaluates if the peptide tested results from a known
cleavage process and therefore only predicted cleaved
peptides were analyzed. NetMHC uses artificial neural
networks to predict binding to the MHC molecule. The
peptides were considered immunogenic if the IC50 was ≤
500nM. To check for predicted cleavage, sequences were
then analyzed using the NetChop algorithm [79], and only
peptides with predicted cleavage were selected. Results
