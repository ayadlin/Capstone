BACKGROUND: Nausea and vomiting (N/V) during chemotherapy can have profound clinical and economic consequences. Effective
antiemetic agents are available for prophylaxis, but barriers may prevent their use. For this population-based study, the authors
assessed the rates of antiemetic prophylaxis use, and predictors of such use, among patients who were receiving platinum-based
chemotherapy for lung cancer between 2001 and 2007. METHODS: The authors searched the Texas Cancer Registryâ€“Medicare-linked
database for individuals aged >65 years who received platinum-based chemotherapy within 12 months after a first diagnosis of lung
cancer from 2001 to 2007; and all patients had continuous Medicare Part A and Part B coverage for the same period. Adherence to
recommended regimens for N/V prophylaxis (established by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network) was scored as a binary
variable (adherent vs nonadherent) and was calculated as the percentages of treated patients receiving each recommended agent
within 1 day of beginning chemotherapy. Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used to examine whether patient characteristics influenced adherence. RESULTS: Of 4566 selected patients, adherence rates for the receipt of serotonin antagonists (eg, ondansetron) with dexamethasone were 60% to 90% regardless of whether the chemotherapy agent was considered moderately or highly
emetogenic. The receipt of substance-P antagonists was much less common (<10%) during any period. On multivariate logistic
regression modeling, variables that predicted adherence were older age, white race, higher median income, and concurrent radiation
therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Recommended use of antiemetics for prophylaxis, especially substance-P antagonists, during chemotherapy
for lung cancer is suboptimal. Factors that were correlated with adherence suggest socioeconomic barriers in the community. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy can have profound clinical and economic consequences, including malaise,
dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, weight loss, feeding tube placement, hospitalization, and death. These symptoms
also can lead to decreased treatment adherence and, hence, inadequate therapy. In 1 population-based analysis, Burke et al
studied the clinical impact of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) from agents considered at high or
moderate risk of inducing emesis and observed that, after the first cycle of chemotherapy, the risk of resultant inpatient
admissions, emergency room visits, or outpatient hospital visits was 18%. Those authors also observed that the cost of
treating patients who experienced CINV after the first cycle could reach $9578 per patient. They concluded that visits for
CINV during the first cycle of chemotherapy were both common and costly and that strategies to reduce the incidence of
CINV could reduce health care use and cost.1
Effective antiemetics do exist in the form of serotonin receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine-3 [5-HT3]) antagonists and
substance P antagonists (SPAs), and several studies have supported their effectiveness for this purpose. For instance, investigators from France compared the use of the 5-HT3 antagonist ondansetron with high-dose metoclopramide for CINV
and observed a significant patient preference for ondansetron (63% vs 26%).2 The superior effectiveness suggested by this

preference was then demonstrated in a comparison by
Hainsworth et al of patients receiving high-dose cisplatin
chemotherapy, in which they observed that ondansetron
was more effective, produced fewer adverse events, and
was easier to administer than intravenous metoclopramide.3 More recent randomized controlled trials have
demonstrated the superiority of regimens that include
SPAs over those with 5-HT3 antagonists alone. Those
studies evaluated patients who were receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and
head and neck cancer.4-7 The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for antiemesis prophylaxis currently include the use of both a 5-HT3 antagonist for high-emetogenic-risk (HER) regimens and an
SPA for moderate-emetogenic-risk (MER) regimens.8
However, barriers to effective antiemesis prophylaxis have been noted, the most significant of which may
be cost. The 5-HT3 antagonists typically cost $5 to $10
per tablet, and SPAs can cost $500 to $600 for a 3-day
course. Given the established clinical and economic benefit of antiemetic prophylaxis, the purpose of our current
population-based study was 2-fold. First, we assessed the
rate of adherence to national guidelines regarding the use
of antiemetic agents as prophylaxis for patients receiving
platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for lung cancer.
Second, we attempted to identify factors that correlated
with adherence to these guidelines in an attempt to better
comprehend characteristics that could improve the use of
prophylaxis in this setting. Our overall objectives were to
provide provocative information regarding the use of
antiemetic prophylaxis for patients with lung cancer, to
determine whether the current guidelines reflect clinical
practice, and to explore ways of increasing the use of these
drugs if their use does not follow these guidelines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Patient Population

The institutional review boards at the University of Texas
Medical Branch at Galveston, The University of Texas
MD Anderson Cancer Center, and the Texas Department
of State Health Services approved this study, as did the
Privacy Review Board of the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services. We used the Comparative Effectiveness Research on Cancer in Texas/Texas Cancer Registry
(TCR)-Medicare linked database for this study. This
database contains 2 large population-based data sources,
which were linked under the guidance of the National
Cancer Institute, the TCR, and the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services. This data set provides detailed information about elderly adults with cancer in Texas.
Cancer

Approximately 98% of all individuals aged 65 years in
the TCR are matched with Medicare enrollment and
claims files. The TCR collects and provides information
on demographics, cancer incidence and prevalence, disease stage at diagnosis, first course of treatment, and survival outcomes. The Medicare claims data include
information on hospital stays, physician services, and outpatient hospital visits. Data use agreements have been
signed with both data providers.
Our study population was patients aged >65 years
(eg, the age cutoff for receiving Medicare) who received
platinum-based chemotherapy for a first diagnosis of lung
cancer from 2001 to 2007. All patients were treated
within 12 months of diagnosis and had continuous Medicare Part A and Part B coverage for the same period. Medicare Part A covers inpatient hospital stays, care with a
skilled nursing facility, hospice, and some home health
care; whereas Part B covers a portion of physician services,
outpatient care, preventative care, and medical supplies
(available at: www.medicare.gov; accessed June 1, 2012).
Because the current antiemesis guidelines do not differ
according to disease characteristics, patients with any stage
and or histology of lung cancer were included in the analysis. In total, 4566 individuals were selected along with
their Medicare claims during the first 12 months after the
diagnosis of lung cancer.
National Comprehensive Cancer Care
Guidelines for Antiemesis Prophylaxis

Recommendations for CINV prophylaxis were extracted
from guidelines published by the NCCN during the period from 2001 to 2007.8 These recommendations differ
according to the emetogenicity of the chemotherapy
agents, with cisplatin doses 50 mg/m2 classified as HER
and cisplatin doses <50 mg/m2 or carboplatin at any dose
classified as MER. It is noteworthy that doses of platinum
compounds cannot be assessed directly through the population database. However, because patients with lung cancer (small cell or nonsmall cell) typically receive cisplatin
doses 50 mg/m2, for the purposes of the current study,
we assumed that any patient receiving cisplatin was given
an HER regimen, whereas carboplatin use represented an
MER regimen. We acknowledge that most of the patients
who received platinum agents for lung cancer also received
other agents. However, our assumption holds, because
other agents in the HER category (eg, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, dacarbazine, epirubicin, ifosfamide, mechlorethamine, and streptozocin) are rarely if ever used for
lung cancer. Therefore, the risk category was driven by the
type of platinum used.

For 5-HT3 antagonists, the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS) codes are J2405 (injection) and Q0179 or S0181 (oral) for
ondansetron, J1626 (injection) and S0091 or Q0166 (oral) for granisetron,

For neurokinin-1 antagonists (aprepitant or fosaprepitant), the HCPCS
codes are J1453 (injection) or J8501 (oral).

Before the guidelines could be analyzed, it was necessary to identify appropriate Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System codes (also known as J codes) for
both the platinum agents and the antiemetic regimens.
The codes for cisplatin were J9060 and J9062; and the
code for carboplatin was J9045. Codes for the relevant
antiemetic medications (four 5-HT3 antagonists, aprepitant or fosaprepitant, and dexamethasone) are listed in
Table 1.
Because the NCCN recommendations for antiemesis prophylaxis changed during the study period (Table
1), we determined adherence in terms of the recommendation for the same year. That is, adherence for a patient
who received treatment in 2001 would be analyzed
according to the 2001 NCCN guidelines, and so on.
Briefly, during 2001 to 2003, only a 5-HT3 antagonist
and dexamethasone were recommended for prophylaxis.
From 2004 to 2005, aprepitant was added for patients
who were receiving HER (ie, cisplatin-containing) regimens. From 2006 to 2007, this recommendation was
expanded to patients who were receiving MER (ie, carboplatin) regimens.

directness and objectivity and because it is not influenced
by a patientâ€™s prior experience with CINV.
Our original plan was to identify factors that were
correlated with adherence to use of all of the agents specified in the NCCN guidelines. However, when we discovered the very low rate aprepitant use (<10%), we analyzed
correlative factors only with the other remaining agents
(ie, 5-HT3 blockers and dexamethasone) to ensure
adequate sample sizes for statistical analysis.
Statistical Methods

To assess the appropriateness of the timing of antiemetic
agent use (the objective being within 1 day of the first day
of the first cycle of chemotherapy), we evaluated Medicare
Part B claims with the Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System codes for platinum-based chemotherapy
and antiemetic agents for each selected patient from 2001
to 2007. We anticipated that all codes for the agents being
studied would be present in the national claims history
and outpatient claims within 12 months after the diagnosis date.9,10 We then estimated the percentage of patients
(with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) who received care
as defined in the guideline for each antiemetic agent.
Logistic regression with stepwise selection was used
to examine whether patient and provider characteristics
influenced the rate of adherence to antiemetic prophylaxis. Factors with a < .05 were retained in the multivariate logistic regression model. Because the numbers of
Medicare claims for aprepitant/fosaprepitant were so low,
the independent variable was the combination of both 5HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone claims within 1 day
of the first chemotherapy date. Candidate variables that
were included in this model (Table 2) were chosen based
on a combination of their availability in the database and
their potential clinical or socioeconomic significance. We
also determined adherence rates across each year of the
analysis to determine whether the time at which the guidelines were implemented influenced the level of compliance. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) values and 95% CIs were
calculated for each significant variable in the logistic
regression model.

Definition of Adherence

Adherence to guidelines regarding prophylaxis was scored

adherent was defined as delivery of the antiemetic agent

chemotherapy. This definition was selected because of its

Rates of Adherence to Guidelines on Antiemetic
Prophylaxis

Rates of adherence to antiemetic prophylaxis for MER
(eg, carboplatin) regimens and HER (eg, cisplatin) regimens from 2001 to 2007 are provided in Table 3. Several
points can be made about these adherence rates. First, 5HT3 antagonists with dexamethasone were received by
approximately 60% to 90% of patients regardless of
whether they received HER or MER chemotherapy. Second, adherence to guidelines regarding SPAs was much
lower at <10% for all periods studied (sample sizes of
<11 patients were suppressed according to the data user
Cancer

agreement). Third, although fluctuations were apparent
across periods, adherence rates tended to increase over
time, including use of SPAs. For instance, from 2001 to
2007, use of 5-HT3 antagonists for MER regimens
increased from 84.7% in 2001 to 89% in 2007; the corresponding percentages for dexamethasone were 53.5% and
74.2% (P < .001; Cochran-Armitage test). The overall
trends in use of 5-HT3 antagonists and dexamethasone
are illustrated in Figure 1.
Because the rate of adherence to recommendations
regarding antiemetic agents was lower than expected, we
performed a supplemental sensitivity analysis to determine whether expanding the timeframe for â€˜â€˜adherenceâ€™â€™
from 1 day to up to 5 days after the start of chemotherapy
would improve the compliance rate (keeping in mind that
antiemetics administered on later days may have been
given for nausea rather than for the prevention of it).
Regardless, we observed that increasing the timeframe for
adherence did not significantly affect adherence rates (Table 4).
Factors Affecting Adherence Rates to
Antiemetic Prophylaxis

Because compliance rates regarding the use of aprepitant
or other SPAs were 10% for all years studied, our analysis of predictive factors for use of the recommended prophylaxis was restricted to 5-HT3 antagonists and
dexamethasone (which had been part of the recommendation during all years for both HER and MER regimens).
That analysis revealed that patients who received treatment in the later years were more likely to have received
antiemetic prophylaxis than patients who received treatment in 2001, with an overall adherence rate of 50.7% in
2001 and 70.9% in 2007 (P < .001; Cochran-Armitage
trend test) (Fig. 1).
Of all the variables that we tested for correlation
with adherence to antiemetics (see Table 2), only a subset
of these variables was statistically significantly associated
with this endpoint. All variable categories are listed in Table 5 along with their P values and 95% CIs from univariate (unadjusted) and multivariate (adjusted) analyses.
Multivariate analysis was performed only on those variable categories that were significant in univariate analysis.
For instance, because white race was associated with adherence, the category of race was included in both univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Specifically, using
this method on multivariate logistic regression modeling,
variables that predicted adherence (adjusted ORs with
95% CIs) were older age (OR, 1.013; 95% CI, 1.0011.026), treatment year (2007 vs 2001: OR, 2.444; 95%

DISCUSSION
This population-based study of rates of adherence to recommended antiemetic regimens for patients with lung
cancer receiving platinum-based chemotherapy revealed
that those rates were suboptimal, particularly with regard
to SPAs (eg, aprepitant). We also observed that the rate of
adherence increased over time, suggesting the existence of
a time lag with regard to physicians incorporating the use
of guidelines after they are published. Finally, several clinical factors were associated with improved use of antiemetic prophylaxis, including white race, higher income
levels, and the receipt of concurrent radiation, suggesting
that multiple components factor into a physicianâ€™s decision to implement these national standards for individual
patients.
Several studies have described the effects of CINV
on quality of life. For example, Fernandez-Ortega et al
assessed quality-of-life scores prospectively in patients
from 9 hospitals who received chemotherapy and who
kept diaries for 5 days after the receipt of systemic treatment. Those authors observed that 40% to 45% of
patients experienced CINV that significantly affected
their quality of life, as estimated by a functional living
index-emesis questionnaire, and that those who experienced significant nausea did so in 90% of chemotherapy
cycles.11 In another study of quality of life in a community

hospital-based setting, approximately 33% of patients
reported that CINV had a substantial impact on their
daily lives. Both acute and delayed CINV affected quality
of life, but only the presence of acute CINV influenced
antiemetic treatment, suggesting that delayed effects are
not being appropriately addressed.12
Population-based data regarding the use of antiemetic prophylaxis are sparse, particularly during the past
decade, and the small studies that have been done have
reported conflicting results. For instance, investigators
from Italy assessed the use of antiemetic regimens in controlled clinical trials and observed that 5-HT3 antagonists,
either alone or with a corticosteroid, have almost completely replaced other regimens for CINV and that virtually all patients received this regimen regardless of the type
of systemic treatment being used.13 In another study
assessing the performance of a feedback system for
improving the use of antiemetic prophylaxis, the overall
rate of compliance for preventing acute CINV was high,
but the vast majority of deficiencies in compliance
reflected not preventing delayed CINV and not administering steroids after chemotherapy.14 Finally, in a recent
analysis of compliance with recommendations from the
European Society of Medical Oncology, the authors studied 299 patients who received chemotherapy in 2008 and
2009. The overall rate of noncompliance in that study was
39%, and only 24% of patients who received an MER
regimen received an SPA; moreover, male sex and hematologic malignancies were predictors of noncompliance.15

A recent review outlined several obstacles to implementing antiemetic guidelines, including, but not limited to,
cost, direct financial conflicts of interest, underestimation
of the incidence of delayed emesis, and the belief that it
has not been sufficiently demonstrated that antiemetic
guidelines improve outcomes.16
To our knowledge, the experience we report here
represents 1 of the largest to date that evaluates compliance with antiemetic guidelines in this context. Our
reported rate of adherence to SPAs was even lower than in
previous reports. We took several measures in an attempt
to include all instances of antiemetic administration,
including a full analysis of Medicare Part B claims for all
observed years as well as exploration of Part D claims for
2006 and 2007 National Drug Codes. Although we confirmed the unexpectedly low rate of aprepitant use, ultimately, we did not use the Part D findings in our analysis,
because Part D was initiated in 2006 (which reduced our
confidence in the enrollment rate), and, by excluding
those claims, we maintained consistency across years.
This low compliance has several potential explanations. First, the findings may be specific to the population
included in this study, which was limited to individuals in
Texas. Second, our definition of adherence was different
from the definitions used in previous publications. For
example, in the study of compliance with European
Society of Medical Oncology recommendations and
in the analysis by Mertens et al, adherence was defined
as the presence of a prescription for the appropriate

antiemetic14,15 as opposed to our definition of administration of the antiemetic within 24 hours of chemotherapy. Our definition, although narrow, is consistent with
true prophylaxis, because it is documented that patients
have taken the medication within a very narrow time
before or after the administration of systemic therapy.
However, we acknowledge that this stricter guideline may
have underestimated the proportion of patients who had
received a prior prescription for an antiemetic agent.

Our discovery that compliance with the prophylaxis
guidelines was associated with race and income implies
that socioeconomic factors may have a role in antiemesis
prevention. Physicians also may perceive (and often rightfully so) that patients who are older or who are receiving
concurrent radiation therapy are at a higher risk of CINV,
and, as such, this subgroup would be more likely to
receive interventions in this context. However, if this is
true, then our finding that patients with more comorbid

conditions, as determined by the Charlson Comorbidity
Index, were less likely to receive prophylactic intervention
is inconsistent with these results. However, it is noteworthy that the cormorbidity index is not equivalent to performance status, which is often what is apparent to the
treating physician and may be more influential in determining management.
Our interpretation of these results is subject to several constraints. First, claims data are inherently limited,
because they are designed for billing, and not for clinical
purposes. Claims are subject to biases caused by under
coding of important events. However, we believe the likelihood of under coding is low in this case, because the
drugs and outcomes of interest are both costly and fully
reimbursable under Medicare and other insurance policies. Second, cancer registry data are subject to ascertainment biases, because patients diagnosed in the ambulatory
care setting may not be included and because treatment
information is limited to the first course delivered within
the first 4 months after diagnosis. Linkage to claims data
permits us to identify missed patients and subsequent
treatment, thereby minimizing this problem. Third, Medicare claims provide information on relatively limited
populations. Although there is no single source for all
populations, including other claim types in addition to
Medicare, such as those for Medicaid patients, will provide large samples of the elderly, poor, and working age
cancer patients. Finally, we made assumptions about cisplatin doses, and we assumed that physicians who adhered
to guidelines during the first cycle would continue to do
so in future cycles. These assumptions are based on clinical data and logical reasoning, but they do highlight the
finding that the results from this study represent our best
estimation of trends in the population based on the only
population-level data available. Furthermore, even if
some patients on cisplatin received doses <50 mg/m2,
those patients should have received an MER antiemetic
regimen, and we observed that the receipt of 5-HT3
antagonists with dexamethasone (excluding aprepitant)
also was suboptimal in all patients.
In conclusion, we used a Texas population-based
cancer registry linked to Medicare claims to demonstrate
that adherence to national guidelines for antiemesis prophylaxis in patients with lung cancer is suboptimal.
Although the data provided have some limitations, we
took several steps to exhaustively include all available
administrations by using claims data and what we consider to be a narrow but appropriate definition of adherence. In this context, we observed that compliance
with administration of SPAs was minimal when the
Cancer

recommendation was first implemented, but it may have
increased steadily over time. Finally, we observed that
socioeconomic, patient-related, and treatment-related
factors influenced adherence, a result that is both indicative of treatment variations based on practice setting as
well as hypothesis-generating for the further exploration
of interventions that could improve compliance across
populations.
