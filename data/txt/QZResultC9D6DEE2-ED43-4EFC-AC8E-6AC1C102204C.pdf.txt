Abstract
The proteasome inhibitor PS-341 (bortezomib or Velcade), an
approved drug for treatment of patients with multiple
myeloma, is currently being tested in clinical trials against
various malignancies, including lung cancer. Preclinical
studies have shown that PS-341 induces apoptosis and
enhances tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL)–induced apoptosis in human cancer cells with
undefined mechanisms. In the present study, we show that PS341 induced caspase-8–dependent apoptosis, cooperated with
TRAIL to induce apoptosis, and up-regulated death receptor 5
(DR5) expression in human non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) cells. DR5 induction correlated with the ability of
PS-341 to induce apoptosis. Blockage of PS-341–induced DR5
up-regulation using DR5 small interfering RNA (siRNA)
rendered cells less sensitive to apoptosis induced by either
PS-341 or its combination with TRAIL, indicating that DR5 upregulation mediates PS-341–induced apoptosis and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells. We
exclude the involvement of c-FLIP and survivin in mediating
these events because c-FLIP (i.e., FLIPS) and survivin protein
levels were actually elevated on exposure to PS-341. Reduction
of c-FLIP with c-FLIP siRNA sensitized cells to PS-341–induced
apoptosis, suggesting that c-FLIP elevation protects cells from
PS-341–induced apoptosis. Thus, the present study highlights
the important role of DR5 up-regulation in PS-341–induced
apoptosis and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in
human NSCLC cells. [Cancer Res 2007;67(10):4981–8]

Introduction
The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL) receptor death receptor 4 (DR4; also called TRAILR1) and death receptor 5 (DR5; also named Apo2, TRAIL-R2,
TRICK2, or Killer/DR5) belong to the TNF receptor gene
superfamily, all of which share a similar, cysteine-rich extracellular
domain and additional cytoplasmic death domain (1). Both DR4
and DR5, located at the cell surface, become activated or
trimerized on binding to their ligand TRAIL or overexpression

and then signal apoptosis through caspase-8–mediated activation
of caspase cascades (1). Recently, these death receptors have
attracted much more attention because their ligand TRAIL
preferentially induces apoptosis in transformed or malignant cells,
showing potential as a tumor-selective apoptosis-inducing cytokine
for cancer treatment. The expression of DR4 and DR5 is inducible
by certain stimuli, including some cancer therapeutic agents (2, 3).
It has been documented that induction of DR4 and/or DR5
accounts for induction of apoptosis and/or enhancement of TRAILinduced apoptosis by certain cancer therapeutic agents (4–9).
Caspase-8 activation is a critical step in initiating death
receptor–induced apoptosis (1). c-FLIP is the major protein that
prevents caspase-8 from activation by death receptors. Although
more than 10 isoforms of c-FLIP mRNA have been described, only
2 of them, FLIPS and FLIPL, have been significantly studied at the
protein level (10). Both proteins can be recruited to the deathinducing signaling complex (DISC) to inhibit caspase-8 activation
(10, 11). There are an increasing number of studies showing that
modulation of c-FLIP levels affects cell sensitivity to death
receptor–mediated apoptosis (10, 11).
It is well known that the extrinsic death receptor–mediated
pathway can activate the intrinsic mitochondria-mediated pathway, through caspase-8–mediated cleavage or truncation of Bid
protein, leading to induction of apoptosis (12). Survivin, a family
member of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins, acts downstream of
mitochondria to prevent processing of initiator caspase-9 from the
apoptosome, leading to inhibition of the activity of the effector
caspases. Thus, survivin modulates both the extrinsic and the
intrinsic apoptotic pathways (13). Many studies have shown that
induction of survivin expression causes cellular resistance to druginduced apoptosis, whereas down-regulation of survivin using
various means, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA), either
induces apoptosis or sensitizes cells to undergo drug- or death
ligand/receptor–induced apoptosis (13).
PS-341 (also called bortezomib or Velcade) is an approved drug
for treatment of patients with relapsed multiple myeloma.
Currently, there are many ongoing clinical trials that test the
anticancer efficacy of PS-341 or its combinations with other agents
in different types of cancers, including lung cancer (14, 15).
Many preclinical studies documented that PS-341 alone or in
combination with other cancer therapeutic agents, including
TRAIL, induces apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells
in vitro, including both hematologic and solid tumor malignancies,
and inhibits the growth of tumor xenografts in vivo (16, 17).
However, the molecular mechanisms underlying PS-341–induced
apoptosis and enhancement of apoptosis when combined with
other agents, including TRAIL, particularly in human lung cancer

cells, remain largely uncharacterized, although it seems to be
associated with nuclear factor-nB inhibition (14, 18, 19), c-Jun NH2terminal kinase ( JNK) activation (19–21), or Bik and Bim
accumulation (22, 23) shown in certain types of cancer cells.
PS-341 has been shown to sensitize cells to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis in certain types of cancer cells; this effect seems to
be associated with Bik accumulation or c-FLIP down-regulation
(22–24). Other proteasome inhibitors, such as MG132, increase DR5
expression, which mediates induction of apoptosis and enhances
TRAIL-induced apoptosis by these inhibitors (25–27). To show the
mechanism by which PS-341 induces apoptosis in human non–
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, we studied the effects of PS341 on the expression of DR4, DR5, c-FLIP, and survivin and their
effect on PS-341–induced apoptosis and enhancement of TRAILinduced apoptosis. Our results show that DR5 up-regulation plays
an important role in PS-341–induced apoptosis and enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells.

Results
PS-341 induces caspase-8–dependent apoptosis. To understand the mechanism by which PS-341 induces apoptosis in human
NSCLC cells, we first determined the effects of PS-341 on induction
of apoptosis by measuring DNA fragmentation in several NSCLC cell
lines. As shown in Fig. 1A, PS-341 increased DNA fragmentation in
H157, H460, and H1792 cell lines, indicating that these cell lines
undergo apoptosis on PS-341 treatment. The sensitivities to undergo
apoptosis of these cell lines are H1792 > H460 > H157. We also
determined the effects of PS-341 on induction of apoptosis in BEAS2B and HBEC3KT immortalized normal human bronchial epithelial
cells. Compared with NSCLC cell lines, these normal cell lines were
much less sensitive to PS-341–induced apoptosis (Fig. 1A).
We next determined the effects of PS-341 on activation of different
caspases in the above human NSCLC cell lines. PS-341 at the tested

concentration range (25–100 nmol/L) effectively induced cleavage of
caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP as indicated by appearance
of the cleaved forms of these proteins in H157, H460, and H1792 cells
treated with PS-341, showing that PS-341 activates these caspases
(Fig. 1B). Moreover, it seemed that the degree of caspase-8 activation,
but not caspase-9 activation, by PS-341 was associated with cell
sensitivities to undergo cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP and DNA
fragmentation (Fig. 1B), suggesting that caspase-8 activation may be
important in PS-341–induced apoptosis. Thus, we further determined
whether caspase-8 activation is required for PS-341–induced apoptosis. To this end, we used caspase-8 siRNA to block caspase-8 activation.
As presented in Fig. 1C, the levels of uncleaved caspase-8 in caspase8 siRNA-transfected cells were substantially decreased compared with
those in cells transfected with control siRNA. Accordingly, we detected
cleaved forms of caspase-8 in control siRNA-transfected cells, but not
in cells transfected with caspase-8 siRNA, on PS-341 treatment,
indicating a successful inhibition of caspase-8 activation induced by
PS-341. Under these conditions, PS-341 efficiently increased levels of
DNA fragments in control siRNA-transfected cells but only weakly in
caspase-8 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that
caspase-8 activation is required for PS-341–induced apoptosis in
human NSCLC cells.
PS-341 cooperates with TRAIL to enhance apoptosis.

documented in other types of cancer cells but not in lung cancer cells.
Thus, we examined the effects of PS-341 in combination with TRAIL
on cell survival and apoptosis in several human NSCLC cell lines,
including A549, which is relatively resistant to TRAIL-induced
apoptosis (34). TRAIL at concentrations ranging from 25 to 100 ng/
mL decreased cell survival by V25% in A549, H1792, and H157 cells,
whereas PS-341 at 50 nmol/L alone decreased cell survival by <30% in
A549 and H1792 cells and by <50% in H157 cells. However, the
combination of PS-341 and TRAIL achieved 50% to 80% decreases in
cell survival in A549 and H1792 cells and >90% in H157 cells
(Fig. 2A). Similar result was also observed in TRAIL-sensitive H460
cells (Fig. 2A).
By specifically measuring DNA fragmentation, a hallmark of
apoptosis, we detected enhanced DNA fragmentation in both
H1792 and A549 cell lines treated with the combination of PS-341
and TRAIL (Fig. 2B). For example, TRAIL at 50 ng/mL alone and
PS-341 at 50 nmol/L alone exerted limited effects on increasing
DNA fragmentation (0.280 and 0.133 arbitrary units, respectively) in
A549 cells. However, their combination increased DNA fragmentation up to 1.67 arbitrary unit (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these results
clearly indicate that the combination of PS-341 and TRAIL exhibits
a more than additive (synergistic) effect on induction of apoptosis
in human NSCLC cells. Moreover, we also examined the effects of
the combination on caspase activation in these cell lines. As
presented in Fig. 2C, the combination of PS-341 and TRAIL was
obviously more potent than each single agent in inducing cleavage
of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-6, and caspase-3 and their
substrates PARP and lamin A/C, evidenced by increased amounts
of cleaved bands in cells treated with the combination in
comparison with those in cells treated with either PS-341 or
TRAIL alone. These data further support that the combination of
PS-341 and TRAIL enhances apoptosis in human NSCLC cells.
PS-341 up-regulates the expression of DR5, FLIPS, and
survivin. Because both caspase-8 activation and enhancement of

TRAIL-induced apoptosis involve TRAIL death receptors and
c-FLIP, we next examined the effects of PS-341 on the expression
of DR4, DR5, and c-FLIP in these NSCLC cell lines. By Western blot
analysis, we detected increased and dose-dependent DR5 expression in the three NSCLC cell lines after exposure to PS-341. The
degrees of DR5 induction in these cell lines were H1792 > H460 >
H157 cells (Fig. 3A), which correlate with cell sensitivity to undergo
apoptosis and caspase-8 activation as described above (Fig. 1A and
B). PS-341 increased DR4 levels in H1792 cells but not in H157 and
H460 cells (Fig. 3A). In agreement, cell surface DR5 levels were
increased in the three cell lines treated with PS-341, whereas cell
surface DR4 levels were substantially increased only in H1792 cells
(Fig. 3B). PS-341 did not apparently alter FLIPL levels; instead, it
increased FLIPS levels in the three cell lines, particularly in H157
and H460 cells (Fig. 3A), which were less sensitive to PS-341–
induced apoptosis compared with H1792 cells (Fig. 1A). We noted
that the basal levels of c-FLIP in H157 and H460 cells were much
higher than in H1792 cells (Fig. 3A). These results suggest that
c-FLIP up-regulation may protect cells from PS-341–induced
apoptosis. Together, these results suggest that DR5 up-regulation,
rather than c-FLIP modulation, plays an important role in PS-341–
mediated apoptosis and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in human NSCLC cells.
It is well known that survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL are other
important proteins involved in regulating apoptosis or enhancing
TRAIL-induced apoptosis (13, 35, 36). Therefore, we also measured
the levels of these proteins in cells exposed to PS-341. PS-341 did
not alter the expression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL in human NSCLC
cells even at concentrations up to 1 Amol/L (see Supplementary
Fig. S1). In a similar fashion to FLIPS modulation, we found that PS341 also increased the levels of survivin in the tested NSCLC cell
lines, particularly in H460 and H1792 cells (Fig. 3A).
We also examined the effects of two other proteasome inhibitors,
MG132 and epoxomicin, on the expression levels of DR5, c-FLIP, and

survivin. As presented in Fig. 3C, FLIPS, but not FLIPL, was elevated
in cells treated with either MG132 or epoxomicin. Similarly, we also
detected increases in survivin levels in cells exposed to either MG132
or epoxomicin. In addition, we also found that both MG132 and
epoxomicin induced DR5 expression. Collectively, these results
suggest that elevation of FLIPS and survivin by PS-341 is likely to
be a consequence of proteasome inhibition.
DR5 up-regulation contributes to PS-341–induced apoptosis.
To determine whether DR5 up-regulation is involved in PS-341–
induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells, we used DR5 siRNA to
block PS-341–induced DR5 up-regulation and then determined its
effect on PS-341–induced apoptosis. As presented in Fig. 4A,
transfection of DR5 siRNA into H157 cells effectively decreased the
basal levels of DR5 expression and PS-341–induced DR5 upregulation. In this experiment, we also included DR4 silencing as a
control, transfection of which into H157 cells substantially reduces
the basal levels of DR4 expression. These results indicate successful
knockdown of either DR5 or DR4. Under these conditions, DR5
siRNA protected cells from PS-341–induced decrease in cell
survival, whereas DR4 siRNA did not have such an effect
(Fig. 4B). By measuring caspase activation using Western blot
analysis, we found that PS-341 induced cleavage of caspase-8,
caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP in cells transfected with control or
DR4 siRNA but not in DR5 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4A).
Accordingly, PS-341 increased DNA fragmentation in cells transfected with control or DR4 siRNA, but this effect was drastically
inhibited in DR5 siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 4C). In agreement,
we observed that PS-341 also induced less amounts of cleaved
forms of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP and DNA fragments in
DR5 siRNA-transfected H460 cells than in control siRNA-trans-

www.aacrjournals.org

fected H460 cells (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Together, these
results indicate that DR5 up-regulation plays a critical role in
mediating PS-341–induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells.
DR5 up-regulation contributes to PS-341–mediated enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Because PS-341
increases FLIPS levels, we also determined whether PS-341
enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis via up-regulation of DR5. The
combination of PS-341 and TRAIL exhibited enhanced effects on
cleavage of caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP, as indicated by the
levels of the cleaved bands by Western blotting, in control siRNAtransfected cells but not in cells transfected with DR5 siRNA
(Fig. 5A). Accordingly, the combination of PS-341 and TRAIL was
significantly less active in decreasing cell survival (Fig. 5B) and in
increasing DNA fragmentation (Fig. 5C) in DR5 siRNA-transfected
cells than in cells transfected with control siRNA. Together, these
results indicate that PS-341 up-regulates DR5 expression, leading to
enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
PS-341 induces apoptosis independently of TRAIL ligand.
The preceding data clearly indicate that PS-341 induces apoptosis in
human NSCLC cells through a DR5-mediated mechanism, whereas
others have shown that PS-341 increased TRAIL expression, which
contributes to PS-341–induced apoptosis in primary chronic
lymphocytic leukemia cells (37). Thus, we further determined if
PS-341–induced DR5-dependent apoptosis involves the TRAIL ligand.
By Western blot analysis, we observed that H157 cells expressed very
low levels of TRAIL, which were not further increased by PS-341 (see
Supplementary Fig. S3A). The presence of soluble recombinant
DR5:Fc, which neutralizes TRAIL, abolished TRAIL-induced decrease
in cell survival and increase in DNA fragmentation but failed to
protect cells from PS-341–induced cell death (see Supplementary

attenuates the ability of PS-341 to
cooperate with TRAIL to activate caspases

cells were cultured in a 24-well plate and
on the 2nd day transfected with control or
DR5 siRNA. Twenty-four hours after the
transfection, cells were reseeded in a
6-well plate (A ) or 96-well plates
(B and C) and treated with 50 nmol/L

with 5 ng/mL TRAIL in combination with
the indicated concentrations of PS-341,
respectively (B), or with the solvent control
DMSO or the combination of 50 nmol/L
PS-341 and 10 ng/mL TRAIL (C ) on the
2nd day after reseeding. After 24-h
(A and B) or 12-h (C ) treatment, the cells

apoptosis in human NSCLC cells independently of TRAIL.
Blockage of FLIPS elevation sensitizes cells to PS-341
treatment. To determine whether FLIPS elevation by PS-341 is
associated with cell resistance to PS-341, we used c-FLIP siRNA
to block PS-341–induced FLIPS elevation and then examined cell
sensitivity to PS-341 treatment. As presented in Fig. 6A, transfection of c-FLIP siRNA not only decreased basal levels of c-FLIP
(both FLIPL and FLIPS) but also more importantly abrogated PS341–induced FLIPS elevation. Subsequently, the cell sensitivity to
PS-341 treatment in c-FLIP siRNA-transfected cells was greatly
increased in comparison with cells transfected with control siRNA
(Fig. 6B). In both H157 and H460 cells, PS-341 induced more
apoptosis in c-FLIP siRNA-transfected cells than in control siRNAtransfected cells (Fig. 6C). For example, PS-341 induced f15%
apoptosis in control siRNA-transfected cells but 30% apoptosis in
c-FLIP siRNA-transfected cells, whereas transfection of c-FLIP
siRNA alone caused only f10% apoptosis (Fig. 6C). Thus, these
results have proved our speculation that FLIPS elevation protects
cells from PS-341–induced apoptosis.

Induction of DR4 and/or DR5 and enhancement of TRAILinduced apoptosis by PS-341 have been shown in certain types of
cancer cells, including colon cancer, prostate cancer, bladder
cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (37, 38). Moreover,
a recent study has shown that the TRAIL/DR4 or DR5 apoptotic
pathway mediates proteasome inhibitor (including PS-341)–
induced apoptosis in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
(37). In the present study, we have shown for the first time that PS341 induces apoptosis in human NSCLC cells through a DR5mediated mechanism because of the following findings: first,
PS-341 induced the activation of caspase-8 and other caspases,
whereas inhibition of caspase-8 activation diminished PS-341–
induced apoptosis, indicating that PS-341 induces a caspase8–dependent apoptosis; second, PS-341 induced DR5 expression,
including cell surface DR5 and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis;

and last, blockage of DR5 up-regulation by siRNA-mediated DR5
silencing abrogated PS-341–induced apoptosis and enhancement
of TRAIL-induced apoptosis, indicating that DR5 up-regulation is
required for PS-341–induced apoptosis and sensitization to TRAILinduced apoptosis. In this regard, our results partially agree with
the findings by Kabore et al. (37) that PS-341–induced apoptosis in
primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells involves up-regulation
of DR4 and DR5, although we failed to show the role of DR4 in
PS-341–induced apoptosis in H157 human NSCLC cells. In primary
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, TRAIL was induced and is
required for PS-341–induced apoptosis because soluble DR4:Fc
inhibited PS-341–induced cell death (37). However, we failed to
detect TRAIL up-regulation in cells treated with PS-341 and
protective effects of soluble DR5:Fc on PS-341–induced cell death
in human NSCLC cells, suggesting that PS-341 induces apoptosis
independently of TRAIL ligand in human NSCLC cells.
DR5 expression is regulated through p53-dependent and p53independent mechanisms (2, 39). Although PS-341 was reported to
increase p53 expression (20, 40), we found that PS-341 increased DR5
expression in NSCLC cell lines with wild-type p53 (H460) and mutant
p53 (H157 and H1792). Thus, PS-341 is likely to up-regulate DR5
expression through a p53-independent mechanism. Some studies
have shown that JNK regulates DR5 expression (6, 41, 42). Although
PS-341 indeed induced JNK activation in our cell lines as shown
previously (20, 21), we found that the JNK inhibitor SP600125 only
weakly attenuated PS-341–induced DR5 induction,1 suggesting that
other mechanism(s) beyond JNK may be involved in PS-341–induced
DR5 expression in human NSCLC cells. Because PS-341 induces
endoplasmic reticulum stress, including up-regulation of CHOP/
GADD153 (43, 44), a transcriptional factor known to regulate DR5
expression (27, 45), it remains to be determined whether PS-341
induces a CHOP-dependent up-regulation of DR5.
c-FLIP is regulated by an ubiquitin-proteasome mechanism
(46, 47), and certain cancer therapeutic agents stimulate downregulation of c-FLIP expression through this mechanism (46).
PS-341, as a proteasome inhibitor, was surprisingly reported to

PS-341 Modulation of DR5 and c-FLIP

reduce c-FLIP levels (24), although other studies showed that PS341 did not alter c-FLIP levels (38) or increased the levels of c-FLIP
in the DISC (48). In our study, we clearly showed that PS-341
increased the levels of FLIPS without altering FLIPL levels in all of
the tested NSCLC cell lines. Moreover, we also showed that other
proteasome inhibitors, including MG132 and epoxomicin, exhibited
similar effects on modulation of c-FLIP expression as PS-341.
Therefore, this is the first study to show that PS-341 and other
proteasome inhibitors selectively increase FLIPS levels, although
the underlying mechanism is currently unclear. A recent study has
shown that FLIPS is more prone to ubiquitination and has a
considerably shorter half-life in comparison with FLIPL (47).
Therefore, it would be interesting to investigate whether PS-341
increases FLIPS levels through inhibition of the proteasome.
Nevertheless, our results indicate that it is unlikely for PS-341 to
enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis through modulation of c-FLIP
in human NSCLC cells.
The basal levels of c-FLIP in H157 and H460 cells, which were less
sensitive to PS-341–induced apoptosis, were much higher than in
H1792 cells, which were more sensitive to PS-341–induced apoptosis.
Moreover, FLIPS levels were greatly increased in H157 and H460 cells
in comparison with those in H1792 cells (Fig. 3). Thus, it seems that the
levels of c-FLIP, particularly FLIPS elevation during PS-341 treatment,
may provide a protective mechanism for cells to counteract PS-341–
induced apoptosis. Indeed, this notion was supported by our findings
that reduction of c-FLIP levels, particularly prevention of PS-341–
induced FLIPS elevation in both H157 and H460 cells, significantly
sensitized cells to PS-341–induced apoptosis (Fig. 6).
Survivin, Bcl-2, and Bcl-XL are known to regulate apoptosis or
enhance TRAIL-induced apoptosis (13, 35, 36). In our study, we found
that PS-341 did not alter the expression of either Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL in
human NSCLC cells, which agree with published results in other types
of cancer cells (22, 23). In a similar fashion to FLIPS modulation, PS341 also increased the levels of survivin in human NSCLC cells
(Fig. 3A). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study showing

that PS-341 increases survivin expression. Given the antiapoptotic
property of survivin, it is likely that survivin up-regulation, like FLIPS
elevation, may counteract the apoptosis-inducing effect of PS-341. It
has been shown that the ubiquitin-proteasome regulates survivin
degradation (49). Given that other proteasome inhibitors (e.g., MG132
and epoxomicin) other than PS-341 also increased survivin levels
(Fig. 3C), it is plausible to speculate that PS-341 may stabilize survivin
through inhibition of the proteasome. Studies to evaluate this
hypothesis are ongoing.
Our results clearly indicate that PS-341 treatment generates
conflicting signals by activating both proapoptotic (e.g., DR5) and
antiapoptotic signaling (e.g., c-FLIP and survivin). Despite upregulation of c-FLIP and survivin, PS-341 indeed induced apoptosis
and enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells
albeit with various degrees. Thus, it seems that PS-341–activated
proapoptotic signaling, such as DR5 induction, can override
activation of antiapoptotic signaling, such as up-regulation of
FLIPS and survivin caused by PS-341, leading to induction of
apoptosis and enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Given
that prevention of c-FLIP elevation during PS-341 treatment
sensitized cells to PS-341–induced apoptosis, it may be possible
to enhance the anticancer efficacy of PS-341 via combination with
other agents, which decrease c-FLIP and survivin expression.
It is known that TRAIL functions as a DR5 ligand and rapidly
induces apoptosis in a wide variety of transformed cells but is not
cytotoxic in normal cells in vitro and in vivo (1, 2). Therefore,
TRAIL is considered to be a tumor-selective, apoptosis-inducing
cytokine and a promising new candidate for cancer treatment.
Unfortunately, certain cancer cell lines and tumors are resistant to
TRAIL-mediated cell killing (2). In addition, agonistic anti-DR5
antibodies can also induce DR5 trimerization, which triggers the
extrinsic apoptotic pathway, thus having great cancer therapeutic
potential (50). In fact, the agonistic anti-DR5 antibody is already
being tested in phase I clinical trials. Therefore, PS-341 may be
useful in combination with TRAIL or an agonistic anti-DR5

antibody to achieve an enhanced effect on apoptosis induction or
overcome TRAIL resistance in human cancer cells.
In summary, our study has shown that PS-341 induces DR5
expression, which contributes to PS-341–induced apoptosis and
enhancement of TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells
despite up-regulation of FLIPS and survivin. Our findings provide
novel insight into the mechanism by which PS-341 induces apoptosis
and enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human cancer cells.
