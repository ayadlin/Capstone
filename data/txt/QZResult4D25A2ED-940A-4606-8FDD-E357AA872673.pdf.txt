BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies suggest that additive or synergistic effects are achieved with the combination of
pemetrexed plus gemcitabine. A phase 1 study of pemetrexed plus gemcitabine given every 2 weeks demonstrated
encouraging preliminary efficacy against head and neck squamous cell cancer (HNSCC). METHODS: This was an
open-label, single-institution, single-arm, phase 2 study for patients who had received no more than 2 cytotoxic regimens for recurrent and/or metastatic HNSCC. All patients received pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously plus gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 intravenously every 2 weeks with vitamin B12 and folate support. The primary endpoint was the
objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST); secondary endpoints
were to estimate overall survival and to evaluate safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients received therapy. All patients had received prior radiotherapy, and half had received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent
and/or metastatic disease. Neutropenia (grade 3) occurred in 24% of patients. Four patients (16%) had a partial
response (PR) according to RECIST, and 5 additional patients (20%) had objective tumor reductions of >20 but
<30% did not meet RECIST criteria for a PR. The median overall survival for all treated patients was 8.8 months. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with pemetrexed plus gemcitabine every 2 weeks with vitamin support generally was well tolerated. The results of this study provided further evidence that pemetrexed may have significant palliative activity

For patients with metastatic or locally or regionally recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) that is
not suitable for surgery or further radiation, the median survival is approximately 6 to 9 months for patients who are
treated with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy.1,2 Objective responses are achieved with single agents, such as platinums,
taxanes, and antifolates. Methotrexate may be considered a historic standard based on excellent tolerability and on survival
outcomes comparable to those observed with more toxic regimens.3 To our knowledge, no randomized trial has demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival for combination therapy with cytotoxic agents compared with monotherapy using a single cytotoxic agent, although response rates and toxicities may be increased with the former approach.1
A phase 3 trial demonstrated similar response rates and median overall survival for patients who received cisplatin plus 5fluorouracil (27% and 8.7 months, respectively) or cisplatin plus paclitaxel (26% and 8.1 months, respectively).4 Even
with the addition of cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, to the platinum plus 5-flourouracil doublet, the median overall survival was only 10.1 months in a phase 3 trial.5 These results highlight the need for novel palliative regimens in this patient population.
Pemetrexed is a multitargeted antifolate that inhibits multiple enzymes involved in both pyrimidine and purine synthesis, including thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyl

transferase (GARFT). Inhibition of TS and DHFR by
pemetrexed overlaps with the mechanisms of other agents
with activity against HNSCC, such as 5-fluorouracil and
methotrexate. A phase 2 study evaluated pemetrexed (500
mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days) in 35 patients who
had locally advanced or metastatic HNSCC that was not
amenable to curative surgery or radiotherapy.6 Fourteen
patients (40%) in that study had received prior chemotherapy, and 27 patients (77%) had received prior radiotherapy. Patients did not receive supplementation with
vitamin B12 or folate. The study mandated an interval of
6 months between study entry and prior chemotherapy
or radiotherapy. The objective response rate was 26.5%
(95% confidence interval [CI], 12.9%-44.4%), and the
median overall survival was 7.3 months. Twenty-four
patients (68.6%) experienced grade 3/4 neutropenia, and
febrile neutropenia occurred in 4 patients (11.4%).
Gemcitabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite that is
anabolized into a diphosphate form, which inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, and a triphosphate form, which is
incorporated into DNA, resulting in chain termination.
In recurrent or metastatic HNSCC, gemcitabine monotherapy has modest activity. In a phase 2 study, 47
patients with advanced and/or recurrent HNSCC
received gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 intravenously on Days
1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle (the gemcitabine dose was
increased to 1250 mg/m2 on the same schedule for an
additional 12 patients). The overall response rate was
13% (7 of 54 evaluable patients; 95% CI, 4%-22%).7 In
another phase 2 trial, 26 patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC received intravenous gemcitabine 1250
mg/m2 weekly for 3 weeks followed by a 1-week rest.
There were no objective responses (95% CI, 0%-13%).8
Because both pemetrexed and gemcitabine deplete
intracellular deoxynucleotide triphosphate pools through
the inhibition of multiple enzymes, it was proposed that the
combination of these drugs might yield synergistic activity
against solid tumors.9 In cell culture assays, synergistic activity has been described with combined administration of
pemetrexed and gemcitabine.10-12 In studies of H460 nonsmall cell lung cancer xenografts, simultaneous administration of both drugs yielded synergy.13 Pemetrexed (150 mg/
kg intraperitoneal injection for 5 consecutive days per week)
and gemcitabine (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection every
third day) were evaluated as monotherapy and as combination therapy. Tumor growth delay (TGD) was 4 days with
pemetrexed monotherapy and 8 days with gemcitabine
monotherapy. When both drugs were combined at these
same doses and schedules, TGD was 20 days.13

A phase 1 study performed at our institution of
pemetrexed plus gemcitabine established a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for patients with advanced solid tumors
of pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 intravenously plus gemcitabine
1500 mg/m2 intravenously given every 14 days in the context of supplementation with vitamin B12 and folate. The
toxicities in the phase 1 study were mostly hematologic, as
expected. Among 7 patients with HNSCC who were
enrolled in the study, there were 2 objective responses.14
These observations suggest that pemetrexed may
have significant activity against HNSCC and that gemcitabine may have a role in enhancing the activity of pemetrexed. Therefore, we conducted a phase 2 study to further
evaluate this doublet regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility
This was an open-label, single-institution trial and was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Adult patients aged 18
years who had a Karnofsky performance status (KPS)
70% were eligible. All patients had recurrent or metastatic epidermoid/squamous carcinoma of the oral cavity,
pharynx, larynx, paranasal sinus, or HNSCC of unknown
primary. Pathologic confirmation at this institution was
required. Patients were not included if they had received
>2 prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens in the recurrent or metastatic disease setting. The presence of measurable disease was required. Patients also must not have
received radiation therapy within 4 weeks of starting gemcitabine and pemetrexed. Required laboratory parameters
were: an absolute neutrophil count >1.5  109/L; hemoglobin >9 g/dL; platelet count >100  109/L; serum bilirubin 1.5 times the upper limit of normal; alkaline
phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT) levels 3 times the upper normal limits (AP, AST, and ALT up to 5 times the upper
limit of normal were allowed for patients who had hepatic
metastases); and a calculated creatinine clearance 45 mL
per minute based on the standard Cockcroft and Gault
formula.
Exclusion criteria were serious concomitant disorders (for example, active infection); brain metastases; previous exposure to pemetrexed or gemcitabine; pregnancy
or lactation; refusal or inability to take folic acid, vitamin
B12, and dexamethasone; and the use of nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDS) with short-elimination half-lives (for example, ibuprofen) for 2 days before,

the day of, and 2 days after receiving pemetrexed (a total
of 5 days held). If patients were taking an NSAID or salicylate with a long half-life (for example, piroxicam or
nabumetone), then they were required to hold the medication for 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days after receiving pemetrexed (a total of 8 days held). All patients
resided within geographic proximity to the treatment center for adequate follow-up during treatment at the investigatorsâ€™ discretion. All patients provided written informed
consent. Men and women of reproductive potential were
required to use a medically acceptable form of birth control while on study.
Treatment Plan
In this study, pemetrexed was given at the MTD (500
mg/m2 intravenously every 2 weeks), as established in the
previous phase 1 study at this hospital.14 Many patients
with advanced head and neck cancer have received prior
chemoradiation therapy, and the potential for severe myelotoxicity was a concern during the planning and development of this study. Because the proposed role for
gemcitabine was as a chemosensitizer for pemetrexed, the
starting dose for gemcitabine, 1250 mg/m2 intravenously
every 2 weeks, was lower than the MTD established in the
phase 1 study.14 This choice of dose allowed us to explore
the potential for gemcitabine to enhance the activity of
pemetrexed without unacceptably increasing the risk of
severe myelotoxicity in this population of pretreated
patients with advanced disease.
Pretreatment assessment of all patients included
complete medical history and physical examination. Baseline laboratory studies within 14 days of treatment
included a complete blood count with white blood cell
differential and platelet counts; a comprehensive metabolic profile (including electrolytes, bicarbonate, blood
urea nitrogen, creatinine, glucose, AP, AST, ALT, total
bilirubin, total protein, albumin, and glucose); prothrombin time; and activated partial thromboplastin time.
Radiologic imaging studies of sites of measurable disease
(preferably computed tomography [CT] scans or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] studies) were obtained
within 4 weeks before therapy. An electrocardiogram was
obtained within 8 weeks before therapy. Pemetrexed and
gemcitabine were provided by Eli Lilly and Company
(Indianapolis, Ind).
Supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B12
began at least 1 week before chemotherapy. Vitamin supplementation consisted of oral folate 250 to 1000 lg daily
and a single intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 1000

lg administered every 9 weeks. Patients continued vitamin
supplementation (folate daily, vitamin B12 injections every
9 weeks) until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed.
Pemetrexed was given immediately before gemcitabine infusion. Patients received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2
intravenously over approximately 10 minutes) followed by
gemcitabine (1250 mg/m2 intravenously over approximately 30 minutes) on Days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle.
For rash prophylaxis, patients received oral dexamethasone
(4 mg twice daily) on the day before, the day of, and the
day after each pemetrexed/gemcitabine treatment.
Evaluation of Response
Radiologic response criteria were based on previously
published RECIST guidelines.15 Radiologic imaging
studies for response assessment of indicator lesions were
obtained every 2 cycles of therapy (typically, approximately every 8 weeks) and/or after the last final study
treatment. The best overall response was defined as the
best response recorded from the start of treatment until
disease progression/recurrence. Stable disease was measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for
disease progression was met.
Toxicity Management
The dose-reduction scheme is shown Table 1. The first
dose reduction involved gemcitabine rather than pemetrexed. This dose reduction scheme was selected because
phase 2 data suggest that, in HNSCC, the activity of
pemetrexed is greater than that of gemcitabine.6-8
After a dose reduction for toxicity, no dose re-escalation was allowed. Any patient with 2 prior dose reductions
who experienced a toxicity that would cause a third dose
reduction had to be withdrawn from study therapy. Treatment delay for up to 28 days from the last treatment day
was permitted to allow a patient sufficient time to recover
from any study drug-related toxicity. A patient who still
could not be administered study drug after 28 days from
the time of last treatment was withdrawn from the study.

Statistical Considerations
The primary endpoint was to determine the objective
response rate of pemetrexed plus gemcitabine administered every 14 days for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. In this population of patients, the historic
response rate for conventional, single-agent chemotherapy
is approximately 10%.3 An experimental regimen is considered worthy of further study if the observed response
rate is 30%. To demonstrate an improvement compared
with the historic control response rate, a sample size of 25
patients was needed to demonstrate an improvement to a
response rate of 30% with alpha and beta error rates of
0.1. The study followed a single-stage design based on the
binomial distribution. If 5 of 25 patients responded,
then we would recommend further study of the regimen.
If 25 patients were treated, then the response rate could be
estimated with a 95% CI of 19.6%. For secondary
objectives, overall survival for each group was estimated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method. Descriptive statistics were used for data regarding safety and tolerability.

RESULTS

recurrent and/or metastatic disease (median number of
regimens, 0.5; range, 0-1). All patients had received previous radiation therapy. One patient with oral cavity cancer
was registered but was removed from study because of disease progression before the receipt of any chemotherapy
on the study; this patient was replaced and was not
included in the analyses of safety and efficacy.
Drug Exposure and Adverse Events
Twenty-five patients received a median of 6 treatments with
gemcitabine plus pemetrexed (range, 1-24 treatments) on
study. Table 3 presents cumulative safety data for all 25
treated patients. Adverse events are included in the table if
they were common (ie, if they occurred in 30% of
patients) or if at least 1 patient experienced a grade 3 event
regardless of attribution. There were no grade 5 events.
Generally, the treatment was well tolerated. However, 2 patients were removed from study because of toxicity during the first cycle. A man aged 74 years with
metastatic oropharynx cancer who was eligible for the
study in the context of mild baseline renal insufficiency
(creatinine clearance, 48 mL per minute on Cycle 1/Day

1) experienced grade 4 neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 mucositis, and grade 3 pneumonia that
required hospitalization after his first treatment with gemcitabine and pemetrexed. Because >28 days elapsed before
the resolution of these adverse events, the patient was
removed from study, as required by the protocol. A CT
scan of the chest after his first treatment revealed evidence
of slight disease progression (4% increase; stable disease
according to RECIST measurements). A man aged 83 years
with metastatic oropharyngeal cancer elected to withdraw
from the study after he experienced grade 3 fatigue during
Cycle 1 despite a dose reduction for the second treatment.
A CT scan of the chest after Cycle 1 revealed a minor
response in lung metastasis (24% reduction; stable disease
according to RECIST measurements).
The most common toxicities that we believed were
possibly related to study drugs were low hemoglobin, lymphopenia, and fatigue. Low hemoglobin is a common
finding in patients with advanced head and neck cancer but
also may be treatment-related. Neutropenia (grade 3)
occurred in 24% of patients, and 2 patients experienced
febrile neutropenia. Two patients experienced pulmonary
embolism. Hyperglycemia, probably because of steroid premedications rather than study drugs, was common but was
clinically significant (grade 3) in only 1 patient.
Seven patients (28% of the study population)
required at least 1 dose reduction because of toxicity on
this study. Two patients (8% of the study population)
required a second dose reduction. The most common reason for dose reduction in this study was neutropenia/febrile neutropenia, which accounted for 3 of the 9 dose
reductions in the study.
Efficacy
The objective response rate was 16% according to
RECIST, and 4 of 25 patients achieved a partial response.
There were no complete responses. For 18 patients, the
best response according to RECIST was stable disease.
For 7 patients, the duration of stable disease was 120
days (range, 120-397 days). Two patients had disease progression at the first radiographic response assessment.
One patient was lost to follow-up after Cycle 1 and did
not undergo radiology studies for response assessment;
however, that patient was included in the current analysis
according to the intention-to-treat principle.
The median overall survival was 8.8 months (range,
from 1.9 months to 30.9 months), and the median follow-up duration was 22 months (Fig. 1). Figure 2 presents
a waterfall plot that illustrates the best response of all

evaluable patients on study. In addition to the 4 patients
who had a partial response (30% reduction in the sum
of the greatest tumor dimensions), 5 additional patients
had reductions >20% in the sum the greatest tumor
dimensions that did not meet RECIST parameters for a
partial response as defined in the protocol. In total, 9 of
25 patients (36%) on this study experienced tumor reductions >20% as their best response.

DISCUSSION
The current phase 2 study establishes that the combination of
pemetrexed plus gemcitabine administered every 2 weeks has
activity against advanced HNSCC. The most common grade
3 toxicities were anemia, lymphopenia, and neutropenia.
Twenty-eight percent of patients required dose reductions for
treatment-related toxicities. The partial response rate according to RECIST was 16%, and the median overall survival
was 8.8 months. According to the statistical plan of the protocol, this regimen is not considered worthy of further study,
because only 4 objective responses were attained. There was a
wide range in the length of overall survival, suggesting heterogeneous characteristics within the study population.
Table 4 summarizes phase 2 efficacy data from the
current study of gemcitabine plus pemetrexed, the pemetrexed monotherapy study by Pivot et al,6 and an ongoing
study by Feinstein et al regarding pemetrexed plus bevacizumab for recurrent/metastatic disease.16 Because of inherent
variability in baseline characteristics among patients who are
treated on separate phase 2 studies, a comparative analysis of
the efficacies of the regimens used in these studies is not possible. Half of the patients in the current study had received
previous cytotoxic chemotherapy for recurrent/metastatic

disease; whereas, in the studies by Pivot et al and Feinstein
et al, patients were excluded if they had received any previous chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic disease. It is
noteworthy that most patients in the current study experienced at least minor tumor regression (Fig. 2).
Unlike the study of pemetrexed in advanced
HNSCC by Pivot et al,6 the current study required vitamin B12 and folate supplementation to reduce the risk of
pemetrexed-related toxicities. In a study of malignant
mesothelioma, vitamin B12 and folate supplementation
reduced the incidence of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia,
diarrhea, mucositis, and drug-related death.17,18 A subsequent randomized trial in nonsmall cell lung cancer confirmed that vitamin supplementation reduces pemetrexedrelated adverse events without compromising efficacy.18,19
In the current study, the incidence of grade 3 neutropenia
appeared to be lower than that observed in the study by
Pivot et al, although the chemotherapy regimen in the current study was more intensive. These safety results indicate
that vitamin supplementation should be included in any
future studies of pemetrexed in HNSCC.

Patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC typically have received cisplatin-based treatment as part of their
initial combined-modality therapy. Cisplatin-based doublets remain the widely accepted standard of care for recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.4 In this patient
population, which generally is treated with palliative intent,
additional exposure to cisplatin can be problematic because
of the cumulative nature of toxicities with cisplatin, including potential nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and ototoxicity. The safety profile of pemetrexed provides rationale for
further study of other pemetrexed-based doublets as palliative therapy for patients with advanced HNSCC.
The efficacy of pemetrexed against HNSCC appears
to highlight a distinction between this disease and squamous cell lung cancer. A phase 3 study compared pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin for
patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer.20
Among patients who had nonsquamous lung cancer (adenocarcinoma or large cell carcinoma), survival was superior in the pemetrexed/cisplatin group (P Â¼ .005).
Among patients who had squamous lung cancer, survival

Cancer

Pemetrexed and Gemcitabine in HNSCC/Fury et al

was better in the gemcitabine/cisplatin arm (P Â¼ .05).
The authors suggested that pemetrexed-based chemotherapy may be a preferred option for patients with nonsquamous lung cancer. Despite this concern regarding the use
of pemetrexed for squamous cell lung cancer, the current
study and other studies in advanced HNSCC6,16 indicate
that pemetrexed has significant activity against squamous
cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract.
The current results do not exclude the possibility
that other schedules of gemcitabine and pemetrexed may
be superior to pemetrexed alone. In a randomized phase 2
trial for patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer,
the optimal schedule was pemetrexed followed by gemcitabine on Day 1 and gemcitabine on Day 8 of a 21-day
cycle.21 Future studies might determine whether the efficacy of the combination of gemcitabine and pemetrexed
in advanced HNSCC can be enhanced by alternate schedules, perhaps with weekly gemcitabine.
In summary, the regimen of pemetrexed plus gemcitabine on an every-2-week cycle administered with vitamin B12 and folate supplementation generally was well
tolerated and had modest palliative activity against recurrent or metastatic HNSCC. The most clinically significant toxicity was myelosuppression. The results of this
study provide further evidence that pemetrexed has significant palliative activity against advanced HNSCC.
