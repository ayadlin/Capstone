ABSTRACT
Carcinoma associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play important roles in breast cancer
development and progression. Recent studies show that microRNAs (miRNAs) are the
main regulators in CAFs. MiR-29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in
CAFs from the miRNA screening. The role of miR-29b in the interaction between CAFs
and breast cancer is still unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of
CAFs on breast cancer cell proliferation and metastasis regulated by miR-29b. We found
that fibroblasts activated by co-cultured breast cancer cells produced higher levels of
some chemokines like CCL11, CXCL14, which accelerated breast cancer cell growth and
induced drug resistance and metastasis. Increased miR-29b expression in activated
fibroblasts could suppress the activating p38-STAT1 signal pathway in breast cancer
cells. We also found that the expression of CCL11 and CXCL14 could be regulated by
miR-29b in CAFs. Our results illustrate that down-regulation of miR-29b in CAFs plays an
important role in tumor stroma by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells. The study
indicates that cancer cells and fibroblasts interaction promotes breast cancer cell growth,
drug resistance, migration and invasion due to the lack of miR-29b expression in CAFs.

MiRNAs are a type of non-coding small RNA
molecules that negatively regulate gene expression at a
posttranscriptional level by binding to the 3′UTR of its
target genes [6]. More and more research focus on the
roles of miRNAs in fibroblasts [7–9]. Fibroblasts secrete
a variety of chemokines, growth factors, cytokines, which
can be regulated by miRNAs [6–9]. Down-regulation of
miR-149, miR-21, miR-409, miR-26b, miR-205, miR-31
and up-regulation of miR-34b and miR-34c expression
could transform resident fibroblasts to carcinoma associated
fibroblasts (CAFs) [10–17]. The reported miRNAs could
regulate gene expression in fibroblasts and then control
cancer development and progression by regulating
cytokines or chemokines. Chemokines are critical
signaling mediators, which involve in the communication
between the cancer cells and fibroblasts through binding
to their receptors [18]. Cell survival, proliferation, stem

INTRODUCTION
The tumor microenvironment plays very important
roles in the development and progression of cancer.
Cancer tissues consist of various cells include cancer
cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, pericytes, immune
cells and various bone marrow-derived progenitor cells
[1–2]. Fibroblasts are the most enriched cells in tumor
stroma. The activated cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
in the cancer niche build a permissive and supportive
microenvironment for tumor development. Fibroblasts
play important roles in cancer progression including
metabolism, metastasis, proliferation, anti-apoptosis,
angiogenesis and chemo-resistance by interaction with
cancer cells or other cells [3–5]. Fibroblasts could affect
behaviors of cancer cells by activating signal pathways,
microRNAs (miRNAs), and soluble molecules and so on.

cell properties, ECM attachment, adhesion, metastasis
in tissues or to other organs including proteolysis of the
basement membrane, locomotion and colony formation will
be changed according to the signals from the CAFs [19].
Our previous screening data showed that miR29b is one of the significant down-regulated miRNAs in
CAFs. Our study is to determine how miR-29b influences
chemokine secretion of CAFs and its role in the regulation
of proliferation, drug resistance and metastasis of breast
cancer cells.

MiR-29b expression down-regulates in CAFs
CAFs and normal fibroblasts (NFs) were isolated
from the tissues of breast cancer. α-SMA is the most
common marker of CAFs, and it was significantly upregulated in CAFs than in NFs using immunofluorescence
assay (Figure 1A).The markers of CAFs including MCT1,
MCT4, α-SMA and FSP1 were examined by western

blotting. It was found that MCT1, MCT4, α-SMA and
FSP1 protein levels were higher than them in NFs, but
CAV-1 was significantly down-regulated in CAFs (Figure
1B). Cell proliferation was assayed for SKBR3 with
conditioned medium (CM) from NFs or CAFs treatment
by colony formation assay (Figure 1C). The results
indicated that CAFs were different from NFs, and CAFs
showed the features of the activated fibroblasts. It was also
shown that CAFs promoted cell migration of SKBR3 cells
(Figure 1D–1E).
To know the role of miRNAs in CAFs, miRNA
array was performed to find the significant miRNAs.
MiR-29b is one of the down-regulated miRNA in CAFs
(Supplementary Table 1). It was also found that miR-29b
including miR-29b-1-5p (miR-29b-1) and miR-29b-2-5p
(miR-29b-2) were down-regulated in CAFs compared to
NFs (Figure 1F–1G). These indicated that miR-29b may
play a suppressing role in CAFs.

Figure 2). 3′-UTRs of the CCL11, CCL4L1, CCL4L2
and CXCL14 have the binding sites of miR-29b-2
(Supplementary Figure 3). To know whether miR29b regulates the expression of the predicted targeted
cytokines, activated CAFs and Hs578Bst fibroblasts
(Hs578BstCM) were transfected with miR-29b-1 or miR29b-2 and the mRNA levels of endogenous cytokines
were measured by real time RT-PCR. The results showed
that CCL11 and CCL18 mRNA decreased when CAFs
and Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-1, and
the mRNA levels of CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17
were slightly decreased (Figure 3A). CCL11 and
CXCL14 mRNA decreased when CAFs or Hs578BstCM
were transfected with miR-29b-2, but mRNAs of
CCL4L1 and CCL4L2 were not changed significantly
(Figure 3B).
Next, to confirm that CCL11 and CCL18
were the target genes of miR-29b-1 and CCL11 and
CXCL14 were the target genes of miR-29b-2, plasmids
with 3′UTR of CCL11, CCL18 and CXCL14 were
constructed. CAFs and Hs578BstCM were transfected
with CCL11, CCL18 or CXCL14 3′UTRs and miR29b, and luciferase activities were assayed. The results
showed that the luciferase activities of wide types of
CCL11 and CCL18 3′UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM
with miR-29b-1 were much lower than miRNA controls
(Figure 3C–3D). The luciferase activities of wide types
of CCL11 and CXCL14 3′UTR in CAFs or Hs578BstCM
with miR-29b-2 were much lower than miRNA controls
(Figure 3E–3F). CCL11, CCL18 protein levels decreased
significantly when CAFs or Hs578BstCM were
transfected with miR-29b-1(Figure 3G–3H). CCL11,
CCL14 protein levels decreased significantly when
CAFs or Hs578BstCM were transfected with miR-29b-2
(Figure 3G–3H). CCL11 and CXCL14 protein decreased
in CAFs or Hs578BstCM with miR-29b-2 transfection
by western blotting (Figure 3I). When miR-29b-1 or
miR-29b-2 was suppressed in MCF-7 cells, CCL11 and
CXCL14 were inhibited at mRNA and protein levels
(Supplementary Figure 4). So, the data clearly indicated
that CCL11 and CXCL14 were the direct target genes of
miR-29b in CAFs or Hs579BstCM.

CAFs with miR-29b inhibits breast cancer
cellular growth
To further investigate the role of miR-29b in CAFs
on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were transfected
with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 and their expression
increased (Supplementary Figure 1). Cell proliferation
was examined by MTT assay. It was found that miR29b-1 or miR-29b-2 could inhibit cell survival in three
breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7 and SKBR3
(Figure 2A–2B). Next, colony formation assay was used
for evaluate cell survival ability. It was shown that miR29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression in CAFs reduced
the number of colonies of breast cancer cells, specially,
in MCF-7 cells (Figure 2C–2D). Cell cycle, reflecting
the cell proliferation, was analyzed by flow cytometry
in breast cancer cells after co-culturing CAFs with miR29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression. The result showed
that miR-29b-1 and miR-29b-2 could decrease the ratio
of G1, G2/M phase and increase S phase in MCF-7 and
SKBR3 cells (Figure 2E–2F). Breast cancer models were
set up using nude mice injected with MCF-7 cells and
used to verify the effect of miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 on
cell growth in vivo. It was found that MCF-7 cells mixed
with CAFs could accelerate tumor growth than MCF-7
cells. MCF-7 cells mixed with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2
overexpressed CAFs attenuated tumor growth (Figure
2G). There was a similar result in breast cancer models
using BT474 cells (Figure 2H). These data suggested
that CAFs with miR-29b-1 or miR-29b-2 overexpression
suppressed breast cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

MiR-29b restoration in CAFs inhibits breast
cancer cellular viability and metastasis by
targeting CCL11 and CXCL14
To further investigate the role of miR-29b in
fibroblasts on breast cancer cells, CAFs cells were
transfected with miR-29b and then co-cultured with breast
cancer cells exposed to CCL11 and CXCL14 (10ng/ml)
for 24h. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay.
It was found that miR-29b could inhibit breast cancer
cell survival and also suppressed cell growth by CCL11
and CXCL14 stimulation (Figure 4A–4B). MiR-29b
could inhibit breast cancer cell migration via CCL11 or

The bioinformatics analysis showed that 3′-UTRs
of the CCL11, CCL18, CXCL9, CXCL14 and CXCL17

could suppress CCL11 and CXCL14 enhanced invasion
(Figure 4E–4F). When the cells were transfected miR-29-1
or miR-29-2 inhibitors, cell survival ability and migration
were enhanced (Supplementary Figure 5).

MCF-7 cells were treated with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/
miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 and exposed to
paclitaxel (10uM) or CCL11 or CXCL14. The cell survival
rates were examined using colony formation assay. The
results indicated that CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/
miR-29b-2 could lead to breast cancer cells growing more
slowly than breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs treatment,
which had higher survival ability than the parent cells
(Figure 5A–5B). Cell apoptosis was also examined in
the MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs, CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1

or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2 with paclitaxel or CCL11 or
CXCL14 treatment for 24 hours. It was shown that MCF-7
cells with CM-CAFs/miR-29b-1 or CM-CAFs/miR-29b-2
showed more apoptosis rates than the cells with CM-CAFs
treatment (Figure 5C–5D).

to CM-CAFs or CM-CAFs/miR-29b and the protein
extraction was for western blotting. We found that p38
was activated in MCF-7 cells with CM-CAFs treatment,
however, in the CM-CAFs/miR-29b or STAT1 is one of
down-stream transcriptional factor of p38 and it was also
inhibited in the breast cancer cells with CM-CAFs/miR29b or CM-CAFs/miR-29b treatment. CM-CAFs/miR-29b
treated cells decreased the activated p38 (Figure 6A and
6B). Other down-stream gene such as ELK1 and PAX6
were also changed.
To know whether STAT1 involves in the chemokine
expression of breast cancer cells, MCF-7 cells were
transfected with STAT1 siRNA or treated with STAT1
inhibitor, CCL11 and CXCL14 were assayed by ELISA.
The results showed that inhibition of STAT1 could reduce

the levels of CCL11 and CXCL14 (Figure 6C). When the
cells were transfected with STAT1 siRNA and treated with
CCL11 or CXCL14, cell proliferation enhancement by
CCL11 or CXCL14 was inhibited in the cells with STAT1
down-regulation (Figure 6D). The results from MTT assay
indicated that inhibition of STAT1 suppressed the cell
survival ability significantly in MCF-7 cells.

tumor cells and stroma. Fibroblasts are the most common
cell type found in the tumor microenvironment and
usually activated to cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs)
due to the signals from the microenvironment, which are
responsible for the synthesis of proteins involved in the
remodeling of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well
as secretion of growth factors that regulate tumor cell
proliferation, survival and dissemination. In the present
study, we identified that miR-29b was the important
molecule for the regulation of chemokines’ expression
in CAFs.
MiRNAs have been implicated in the activation
of fibroblasts. There are reports showed that miR-31,
miR-148a and others are down-regulated in activated
fibroblasts [9–16]. Previous study showed that miR-29b is
down-regulated in prostate cancer and breast cancer [20–
21]. Our study showed that miR-29b was down-regulated
in CAFs, when miR-29b was introduced into CAFs, the
characteristics of CAFs were like NFs (not shown). MiR29b acts as a tumor suppressor in most cancer types [23–
29]. Our results supported that miR-29b plays a suppressor
role in tumor stroma.
There are reports shown that fibroblasts involve in
the cross-talk of cancer cells and fibroblasts by secreting

CCL2 [30–32], CCL5 [33], CXCL1 [34], CXCL6 [35],
CXCL12 [36], IL6 [37], CXCL16 [38] and others [23–
31]. In the study, we identified that CCL11 and CXCL14
were the target genes of miR-29b in fibroblasts. When
miR-29b expression is downregulated in CAFs or
activated fibroblasts, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression
were significantly higher than the normal fibroblasts.
CCL11 and CXCL14 could secret to the outside of
the cells and they mainly exist in the extracellular
microenvironment. MiR-29b was shown as a negative
regulator of CCL11 and CXCL14, but not other
chemokines predicted listing in Figure 2. When the CAFs
or activated fibroblasts were transfected with miR-29b
mimics, CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in the culture
media were suppressed. CCL11 and CXCL14 from the
CAFs will exert on breast cancer cell and then promotes
cell proliferation and metastasis. Further molecular
mechanism exploration indicated CCL11 and CXCL14
could active p38-STAT1 pathway in breast cancer cells.
Our findings showed that lack of miR-29b expression in
CAFs could promote CCL11 and CXCL14 expression,
which activate p38 and then promote cell proliferation
and metastasis.

CAFs/NFs>2 meant that miRNAs were significantly up-regulated in CAFs. CAFs/NFs<0.5 meant that miRNAs were
significantly down-regulated in CAFs.

Co-culturing of breast cancer cells and
fibroblasts and conditioned medium preparation

In a conclusion, as shown in Figure 6E, our
study elucidated that lack of miR-29b expression in
CAFs could promote cellular viability and metastasis
by activating p38-STAT1 in breast cancer cells by upregulation of CCL11 and CXCL14 expression in CAFs.
STAT1 could promote CCL11, CXCL14 and CCL2
production and then accelerate cell proliferation. This
is a positive feedback process. There need more studies
to evaluate the function of other miRNAs aberrantly
regulated in CAFs and their network. Revealing the
molecular mechanisms involved in CAFs-mediated
cancer growth and progression may be beneficial for
finding new cancer therapy targets.

CAFs and NFs were co-cultured with breast cancer
cells with the ratio at 1:1. Cells were cultured in DMEM/
F12 media with 10% FBS supplemented with 10% FBS
in a 37°C humidified incubator with an atmosphere of
5% CO2 and 95% air for 24 hours, and then washed for
three times with PBS and finally cultured in 3ml serum
free DMEM/F12 media for 2 hours. Conditioned medium
was collected and filtered through a 0.22-μm filter (Merck
Millipore, Massachusetts, USA) to remove cellular debris.

Reagents

Antibodies against MCT-1, MCT-4, FSP1, CAV1, α-SMA, phospho-p38 (Thr180/Tyr182), p38, PAX6,
STAT1, and total β-actin were obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology. All other chemicals were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Recombinant human chemokines
kits were purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Cell lines and culture
The breast cancer cell lines were originally
purchased from American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and were maintained in
Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium containing 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 100μg/
mL streptomycin. Fibroblasts Hs578Bst were obtained
from ATCC and maintained in Hybri-Care Medium
(ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) with 30 ng/ml EGF, 100
units/mL penicillin, and 100μg/mL streptomycin. All the
cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere of 95%
air and 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Real time RT-PCR
Total RNA was extracted from the cells with the
indicated treatment using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was
qualified and performed for real time RT-PCR analysis.
The primers sequences used in this study were provided
in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Table 1).
The relative miRNA or mRNA levels were calculated
by comparing Ct values of the samples with those of
the reference, all data normalized to the internal control
GAPDH or U6 snRNA.

Isolation and culture of cancer-associated
fibroblasts
Carcinoma associated fibroblasts were isolated
referred to the previously reports from five breast cancer
tissues [22], which were diagnosed with mammary ductal
carcinoma. The experiment was obtained the agreement
from the Institutional Review Board of our hospital. The
fresh breast cancer tissue samples were washed and kept
in PBS containing antibiotics (100 U/ml penicillin, 100
μg/ml streptomycin, 1.5g/ml Fungizone) (Invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA) at 4°C. The tissues were
cutted into about 2 mm fragments and then digested
overnight at 37°C with 0.1% collagenase III (Worthington
Biochemical Corp., Lakewood, NJ) in DMEM and 10%
FBS. The following day, the epithelial cells were separated
by centrifuge. The stromal cells were washed in PBS and
cultured. All experiments were performed before the
10th passage. In addition, normal fibroblasts (2cm from
breast cancer tissues) were isolated according to the CAFs
isolation.

buffer was added to each tube to be analyzed by flow
cytometry within one hour.

ShRNA lentiviral particle delivery system was used
to generate STAT1 siRNA, and STAT1-silenced tumor
cell lines were done according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). The
lentiviral particles were purchased from Sigma (SigmaAldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA). After selection under
puromycin (1μg/ml), the knocking down effect in the drug
resistant cells was evaluated by western blot.

Lentivirus carrying miRNAs
Vectors carrying miRNAs were constructed using
the BLOCK-iT pol II miR RNAi Expression Vector Kit
with EmGFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The
primary miR-29b-1-5p and miR-29b-2-5p sequences
with flanking regions were amplified by PCR and then
coloned into pcDNA6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR. Lentivirus
for miR-29b-1-5p and miR-29b-2-5p was produced using
293T cells by co-transfection with lipofectamine-2000
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the protocol
according to the instruction. MiR-29b-1-5p and miR-29b2-5p expression were examined using real time RT-PCR.

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were cultured in 24-well plates with lowglucose (1g/L), low-serum (0.5% FBS) medium (0.5 mL/
well) at 37°C. Following the indicated treatments, 10 mg/
mL methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT)
was added (50 μL/well), and the cells were incubated for
an additional 2 hours. The cells were then lysed with a
lysis buffer (500μL/well) containing 20% sodium dodecyl
sulfate (SDS) in dimethyl formamide/H2O (1:1, v/v; pH
4.7) at 37°C for at least 6 hours. The relative number
of surviving cells in each group was determined by
measuring the optical density (OD) of the cell lysates at
an absorbance wavelength of 570 nm.

Transfection and dual luciferase assay
Cells were seeded on plates and the transfection
was carried out in Opti-MEM medium using
lipofectamine-2000 according to the manufacturer's
protocol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The medium
was changed after transfection for 5h, and the cells
incubated at 37°C for the indicated time. For reporter
assays, cells were transfected with the pGL3 basic vector
or the control plasmid with co-transfecting with siRNAs.
48h later, luciferase activity was detected using Dual
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, WI, USA) with a
Sirius luminometer (Berthold Detection System).

Cell colony formation
The cells were harvested, sparsely plated, and
were cultured under the normal condition. The medium
underwent the replacement at three-day intervals. And
then the cells were fixed in 90% ethanol, stained with
crystal violet and colonies consisting of at least 50 cells so
they were counted ten days later.

In vivo experiment
5×106 CAFs transfected with miR-29-1, miR-29-2 or
miRNA control and cells combining with 5×106 MCF7 or
SKBR3 cells were suspended in 100 μL phosphate buffered
saline and then injected into the fat pads on 6-week-old
female athymic nude mice (Shanghai Laboratory Animal
Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai, China).
Tumor size was measured once a week, and the tumor
growth was analyzed by measuring tumor length (L) and
width (W) and calculated with the formula πLW2/6. All
the animal work was conducted in concordance with the
guidelines of the Animal Care Committee.

Cell cycle
In 2ml culture medium 2×105 cells/well (6-well
plate) were seeded, and cultured for the indicated time
before collection. The cells were stabilized with 75%
ethanol for 24 h, and dyed with PI, and analyzed with
ModFit of flow cytometry.

Cell apoptosis
For apoptosis assay, the Annexin V straining was
quantified by flow cytometric. The cells were plated in
a 6-well plate, transfected with the indicated plasmids
or siRNA or IGF2 treatment at 24 h later, the complete
growth medium were changed to growth medium without
serum. At another 24 h later, the cells were collected,
washed in cold PBS twice and resuspended in 1×binding
buffer at a concentration of 1×106 cells/ml. After that,
the cells in 100 μl solution were transferred to a 5 ml
culture tube, with 5 μl Annexin V-FITC and 5 μl PI (BD
Biosciences) added, and gently vortexed and incubated for
15 min at RT in the dark. And finally, 400 μl 1× binding

Statistics
Data were analyzed by SPSS 13.0 software and
presented as mean ±SE of at least three independent
experiments. Two-tailed Student's t test was used for
comparisons of two independent groups. p<0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
