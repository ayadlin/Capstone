BACKGROUND. Ovarian cancer (OC) is associated with a >75% risk of recurrence after completion of primary therapy. Several clinical trials have explored the role of continued therapy after complete response to primary adjuvant
therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence; however, these trials have largely been underpowered, leading to inconclusive results. METHODS. A systematic search strategy was initiated to identify all clinical trials involving consolidation
or maintenance therapy regimens for OC in first complete remission. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate toxicity and progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS). RESULTS. There were 37 publications meeting all eligibility
criteria, representing 20 consolidation and 9 maintenance therapy trials. Consolidation and maintenance therapies
were associated with improved PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [P ¼ .003] and HR, 0.82 [P ¼ .02], respectively) and OS
(HR, 0.68 [P ¼ .0008] and HR, 0.68 [P ¼ .007], respectively). This relationship remained statistically significant when
the analysis was limited to randomized trials and across other sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS. Although individual studies have not yet convincingly shown a survival advantage with maintenance chemotherapy in OC, this metaanalysis demonstrates that continued chemotherapy after completion of primary therapy for OC improves PFS and
OS. Benefits are greatest in patients with advanced stage OC who reach complete clinical or pathologic response afC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Ovarian cancer (OC) has the highest mortality rate of all cancers of the reproductive system, and is the fourth leading

cause of cancer-related death among women.1 Women with OC are faced with a 5-year survival rate of 46% for all stages,
which drops to 31% for advanced disease.1 Since the 1970s, treatment advances have led to <5 months improvement in
overall survival among women with OC.2 The majority of OC patients respond to primary therapy consisting of debulking surgery followed by platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy. However, most women recur, and recurrent OC is
invariably fatal. Thus, significant effort has been dedicated to improving the outcome of primary therapy to avoid recurrences, including increased intensity of primary chemotherapy,3,4 addition of new agents to the standard regimen,5 or continuation of primary therapy in the form of either consolidation or maintenance therapy.6,7 In general, consolidation
therapy is designed to be a short-term treatment boost after initial therapy to consolidate the initial response to therapy.8
Maintenance therapy is designed to maintain the disease-free period as long as possible, while delivering a reduced dose of
chemotherapy over a longer period of time (eg, 6 cycles or more).7 It has been speculated that continued reduction of residual cancer cells by extending the period of chemotherapy administration will diminish the risk of tumor regrowth. The
concept of maintenance therapy has its roots in the experience extracted from the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemias, where postremission therapy continued to reduce the burden of residual cancer cells, eventually yielding eradication
of the disease.9,10 Although this hypothesis has not yet been validated experimentally in solid tumors, the emergence of

the cancer stem cell theory11,12 further supports the idea
that residual cancer cells with stem cell properties persist
after completion of chemotherapy and eventually give rise
to recurrent metastases that recapitulate the characteristics
of the original tumor. This concept strengthens the rationale for investigating postremission therapy to eradicate residual chemotherapy-resistant tumors. The purpose
of this meta-analysis was to pool and analyze the existent
data on consolidation and maintenance therapy in OC.
The largest and most compelling randomized trial
conducted to test this theory evaluated 12 versus 3 cycles
of monthly paclitaxel as maintenance therapy in OC
patients in first remission.7 At the time of a planned interim analysis, the Southwest Oncology Group Data and
Safety Monitoring Committee noted significant differences in progression-free survival (PFS) and recommended
study closure.7 As a result, enrollment was halted, which
led to a reduction in the statistical power to detect an overall survival (OS) benefit.13 Another nonrandomized small
study using the same regimen as the Southwest Oncology
Group trial recorded improved PFS in patients receiving
12 cycles of therapy compared with controls (11 vs 24
months, P ¼ .0062) and an improved median OS (38
months vs not reached; P ¼ .0019).14 On the contrary, a
randomized trial of 6 courses of monthly paclitaxel versus
no further treatment found no significant improvement
in PFS or OS, but this study was also underpowered.15
Those and other studies’ discrepant results led to unclear
interpretation of the data for application in clinical practice.16-18 As a result, the choice of whether to pursue continued therapy is generally made based on the physician’s
own viewpoint about its value. To address these inconclusive data, a meta-analysis was conducted to assess the
impact of consolidation and maintenance therapy on survival and toxicity outcomes among patients with OC in
first remission.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Inclusion Criteria
To be included in the analysis, continued therapy was
defined as any postprimary treatment for OC patients after completion of primary therapy. Eligible studies were
required to include at least 2 treatment groups, with continued therapy in at least 1 treatment group. Studies were
also required to include participants with ovarian or peritoneal cancer, and to report data on PFS or OS. Review
articles, case reports, retrospective studies, studies addressing treatment for persistent or recurrent OC or post-

front-line maintenance therapy regimen (eg, post-secondor third-line treatment), and those allowing an extended
treatment-free interval were excluded. Studies of continued therapy were then categorized into consolidation regimens (treatment period <6 treatment cycles) and
maintenance regimens (at least 6 treatment cycles).
Trial Identification
The following search terms were used to identify ovarian/
peritoneal cancer research studies: ‘‘ovarian neoplasms’’;
‘‘ovarian carcinoma’’; ‘‘ovarian cancer’’ or ‘‘peritoneal
neoplasms’’; ‘‘peritoneal carcinoma’’; and ‘‘peritoneal cancer.’’ The following search terms were used to identify
studies that investigate maintenance therapies: ‘‘consolidation,’’ ‘‘consolidation therapy,’’ ‘‘maintenance therapy,’’ and ‘‘maintenance treatment.’’ Studies considered
for potential study inclusion required at least 1 ovarian/
peritoneal and 1 maintenance term as described above. All
terms were expanded to include all subcategories and
searched as keywords to attempt to obtain all published
research that potentially fit the inclusion criteria. OVID/
Medline 1950 to December 2009, the Society of Gynecologic Oncology abstracts, the Cochrane register of controlled trials, and the American Society of Clinical
Oncology abstracts were reviewed.
Data Collection
Each publication underwent data abstraction by 2 independent reviewers and was matched for accuracy. A third
independent reviewer served as a tiebreaker for all discrepancies, followed by a third review for accuracy. For studies
reported in >1 publication, data abstracted were limited
to the most recent for each variable. When data were missing from the primary publication, the authors were contacted to attempt to obtain complete data.
Study quality was assessed using the Cho and Bero
scale,19 which grades each study based on 24 factors (eg,
study design, randomization, statistical power). The
resulting quality score ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0
reflecting highest study quality.
Data Analysis
Hazard ratios (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and
variances were calculated using the Excel software
described by Tierney and colleagues20 when not explicitly
stated in the original articles. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for toxicities. Data were analyzed using the software package Comprehensive Meta-Analysis V2.2.050
(Biostat, Englewood, NJ). In the pooled analysis,

chemotherapy was considered the experimental treatment
if not explicitly stated. Whenever possible, survival data
were limited to patients who had experienced complete
response (CR) after primary therapy. Median values were
obtained from the survival curves when not reported in
the article.
Tests of homogeneity (Q statistic) were performed
to assess the extent of variability among included studies
that may be because of more than sampling error.21 The
planned endpoints included OS, PFS, and toxicity. The
influence of publication bias was determined by assessing
the fail-safe N (the number of unpublished, nonsignificant studies needed to bring the pooled P value to
>.05).22 In addition, a trim and fill analysis23 was
conducted.
Sensitivity analyses were performed by subgroups to
further test the stability of the survival analyses, including
only randomized trials, type of treatment regimen, stage
of disease at diagnosis, and extent of disease after primary
therapy.

RESULTS
Figure 1 demonstrates the process of selection and the
results of the search strategy. The initial search strategy
found 2877 publications fulfilling the wide search criteria.
Of these, the primary reasons for exclusion included
reporting of results of only 1 treatment group (n ¼ 1649)
and being other than a clinical trial (n ¼ 797). For
abstracts that were not initially excluded (n ¼ 125), the
full text articles were obtained and reviewed. A total of 37
articles representing 29 trials met eligibility criteria and
Cancer

underwent data abstraction (Table 1). These trials
included 20 consolidation and 9 maintenance trials (1
trial was a 3-arm study, including 2 trials of consolidation
and maintenance therapies, respectively, vs control).
Eleven (55%) consolidation trials and 7 (78%) maintenance trials were randomized. Twelve (60%) of the consolidation trials and 5 (56%) of the maintenance trials
enrolled only patients achieving CR or pathologic CR after primary therapy. Ten (20%) consolidation trials and 4
(44%) maintenance trials were limited to patients with
advanced OC (stages III-IV). Although the majority of
trials permitted enrollment of patients with stage I-II disease, early stage disease represented a minority of enrolled
patients. Only 3 consolidation trials included a treatment
group that included 40% to 50% of patients with early
stage disease, 2 of which disproportionately enrolled
patients with early stage OC to the control regimen. The
Q statistic was statistically significant, demonstrating heterogeneity across all trials (Q value ¼ 46.42, P ¼ .006),
consolidation trials (Q ¼ 32.69, P ¼ .008), and maintenance trials (Q ¼ 7.43, P ¼ .02). Therefore, a random
effects model was used for all analyses. The median OS
data were reported descriptively for each study separately,
and were available for 14 consolidation trials and for 9
maintenance trials. It is interesting to note that the average
gain in survival for the experimental as compared with the
control treatment was 16.5 months for consolidation
therapy and 8.3 months for maintenance therapy.
PFS
Data on PFS were not provided in the Bolis, Goldberg,
Lawton, Nicholson, and Umesaki studies, and only progression rates were available for the Ben-Baruch study, so
a hazard ratio could not be estimated. Therefore, these
studies were excluded from the PFS analysis. When considering all studies, continued therapy was significantly
associated with improved PFS (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.730.91 [P ¼ .0002]). For consolidation therapy regimens
(<6 cycles of continued therapy), there was also a significant improvement in PFS (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.93
[P ¼ .003]). When limited to maintenance therapy regimens, there remained a significant improvement in PFS
(HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.96 [P ¼ .02]) (Fig. 2).
OS
Data on OS were not reported in the Barakat, DePlacido,
and Goldhirsch studies, which were therefore excluded
from the OS analysis. When considering all studies, continued treatment was significantly associated with

12). Two additional studies reported toxicities by treatment group, but did not report any of the same toxicities
for comparison purposes. The 10 (35.7%) remaining
studies reporting at least 1 type of toxicity for the experimental and control groups were included. Hematologic
toxicities were reported inconsistently (eg, 3 studies
reported thrombocytopenia, 2 reported leukopenia, and 3
reported anemia or thrombocytopenia, whereas 3 others
reported ‘‘hematologic’’ toxicities without specification).
Cardiotoxicity (reported in 3 trials), infection (2 trials),
and a series of trials reporting unique toxicities could not
be pooled for analysis. Nausea/vomiting (OR, 1.76; 95%
CI, 0.86-3.60 [P ¼ .12]; 6 studies), pain (OR, 1.06; 95%
CI, 0.58-1.96 [P ¼ .89]; 5 studies), and fatigue (OR,
1.79; 95% CI, 0.96-3.35 [P ¼ .07]; 4 studies) were not
significantly higher among those treated with continued
therapy. However, neurotoxicity was significantly higher
among patients treated with continued therapy (OR,
2.25; 95% CI, 1.25-4.07 [P ¼ .007]; 6 studies).

treatment was significantly associated with improved OS
(HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55-0.85 [P ¼ .0008]). When considering only maintenance therapy, treatment remained
significantly associated with improved OS (HR, 0.68;
95% CI, 0.51-0.90 [P ¼ .007]) (Fig. 3).
Toxicity
The majority of studies (85.7%, n ¼ 24) reported toxicity
data on at least 1 of the treatment groups. However, more
than half of the studies could not be included in the
pooled analysis because of a lack of reporting any toxicity
data (n ¼ 5) or because of reporting toxicity in the experi-

5256

Publication Bias and Study Quality
Table 2 shows the result of the fail-safe N analysis. The
very large number of insignificant studies required to
remove the observed significant effect indicated that publication bias, even if it existed, would not have changed
the conclusion of the study. The trim and fill analysis and
associated funnel plot suggested that 10 trials may have
been suppressed in the literature; however, these were limited to consolidation trials. In the range of 0 to 1.0, with
zero representing worst possible and 1.0 representing ideal
study quality, the average quality of consolidation trials
was 0.68 (range, 0.47-0.94) and of maintenance trials was
0.70 (range, 0.37-0.92).
Sensitivity Analyses of PFS
Six of the 20 consolidation trials evaluated radiation therapy, 5 of which reported PFS data. These trials demonstrated improvement in PFS (HR for radiation therapy,
0.68; 95% CI, 0.49-0.94 [P ¼ .02]). Chemotherapybased consolidation regimens (n ¼ 11 trials) were not
associated with improved PFS (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.711.01 [P ¼ .07]). None of the maintenance trials evaluated
radiation therapy.
When limited to randomized trials, both consolidation therapy (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.98 [P ¼ .03]; 11
trials) and maintenance therapy (HR, 0.84; 95% CI,
0.73-0.97 [P ¼ .01]; 6 trials) were significantly associated
with improved PFS. When limited to trials that enrolled

patients with stage III-IV disease, maintenance therapy
was associated with improved PFS (HR, 0.78; 95% CI,
0.61-0.99 [P ¼ .04]; 5 trials), but when >10% of the
study population had early stage disease, this relationship
was not significant (HR for PFS, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.721.13 [P ¼ .37]; 2 studies). When limited to patients in
CR or pathologic CR, PFS was significantly improved
with both consolidation (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.66-0.92
[P ¼ .004]; 8 trials) and maintenance therapy (HR, 0.76;
95% CI, 0.63-0.93 [P ¼ .009]; 5 trials). When patients
with residual disease after primary therapy were included
in the analysis, these trials did not demonstrate improved
PFS (consolidation HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.65-1.12 [P ¼
.25]; 7 trials; maintenance HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.75-1.24
[P ¼ .77]; 2 trials).
Sensitivity Analyses of OS
When evaluating subgroups of trials by consolidation regimen (chemotherapy or radiation therapy), consolidation
chemotherapy was associated with a significant survival
advantage (OS HR for chemotherapy regimens, 0.69;
95% CI, 0.52-0.69 [P ¼ .006]; 10 studies). Radiation
therapy was associated with improved OS (HR for radiation therapy, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.45-0.66 [P ¼ .04]; 6 studies). No maintenance trials involved radiation therapy as
the experimental treatment regimen. When limited to
randomized trials, both consolidation (HR for OS, 0.77;
95% CI, 0.62-0.96 [P ¼ .02]; 12 trials) and maintenance
therapy (HR for OS, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.84-0.99 [P ¼ .04];
7 trials) were associated with a significant survival advantage. When limited to studies with >90% of participants
with stage III-IV disease, consolidation therapy was significantly associated with OS (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55-0.86
[P ¼ .001]; 9 trials). When limited to trials that enrolled
>10% of participants with early stage OC, consolidation
therapy no longer demonstrated a significant OS advantage (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.44-1.00 [P ¼ .05]; 8 trials).
When limited to studies with >90% of participants having stage III-IV disease, there also remained a significant
survival advantage (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.43-0.86 [P ¼

.004]; 7 trials). When limited to trials of >10% of
patients with early stage disease, maintenance therapy was
no longer associated with improved OS (HR, 0.89; P ¼
.65); however, there were only 2 trials (384 patients)
reporting OS that met this criterion, which may limit the
ability to definitively evaluate this relationship.

DISCUSSION
Studies published to date evaluating different strategies of
maintenance or consolidation therapy for OC patients in
remission at the end of primary therapy have failed to
detect a survival benefit. This has been largely attributed
to lack of adequate statistical power for these trials.
Indeed, the average sample size among the studies identified and included in this meta-analysis was 114 patients,
corresponding to 57 per treatment group. Power calculations for the Southwest Oncology Group trial predicted
that 225 patients per arm were needed to detect a significant OS improvement caused by maintenance therapy.7
However, this trial was stopped early, so that only 150
and 146 patients were enrolled to the maintenance and
control arms, respectively. This early stopping and
allowed crossover of patients randomized to the control
arm to maintenance strategy led to severe underpowering
of the trial for detection of an OS benefit.13
Thus, there has been no single maintenance trial
conducted to date that has reached a sample size with
enough power to detect survival benefits. A meta-analysis
is an appropriate strategy to increase the power to detect
differences by pooling the results across studies that may
be underpowered individually.24 By pooling the results of
these trials to include 2205 patients enrolled in consolidation therapy trials, and 1240 patients enrolled in maintenance therapy trials, this meta-analysis has increased the
power to detect survival benefits. This meta-analysis demonstrates a statistically significant improvement in PFS
and OS for both consolidation and maintenance therapy,
providing a strong rationale for continued investigation of
this strategy in OC. Importantly, survival analyses
remained statistically significant when limited to randomized trials (consolidation OS HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.620.96 [P ¼ .02]; maintenance therapy OS HR, 0.84; 95%
CI, 0.84-0.99 [P ¼ .04]).
Prospective studies addressing this question are
ongoing. The Gynecologic Oncology Group has activated
a randomized phase 3 trial testing 12 months of maintenance paclitaxel versus CT-2103 (paclitaxel polyglutamate) versus placebo control for patients with advanced

5258

OC in clinical CR at the end of primary therapy (Gynecologic Oncology Group protocol 212). This study is powered to demonstrate a 25% improvement in OS, and
anticipates enrolling 1130 patients. Other trials that are
currently active or are awaiting analysis include studies
testing immunotherapy (eg, abagovomab), antiangiogenic
treatments (bevacizumab, sorafenib), or other biological
pathways inhibitors (eg, hedgehog inhibitors, poly adenosine diphosphate-ribose polymerase inhibitors). An early
yet unpublished report of maintenance antiangiogenic
therapy with bevacizumab suggests that this strategy is
associated with PFS benefit.25
This meta-analysis shows that the impact of maintenance therapy on survival is greater for trials including a
greater proportion of patients with advanced stage OC
and for treatment trials as postremission intervention.
This is consistent with what is known about higher cure
rates for patients with early stage OC, where presumably
additional cycles of therapy (6 vs 3) yields no added benefit.26 It is therefore not surprising that continued therapy
after a CR does not provide increased benefit in this setting. Likewise, the benefits of systemic chemotherapy
compared with radiation therapy can be attributed to its
ability to target residual cancer cells regardless of their
location.
A weakness of our analysis continues to be the reliance on limited reporting of toxicity data. Neurotoxicity
remains a concern for continued therapy, and is largely
dependent on the nature of primary therapy and continuation treatment. This is significant issue for patients
reaching a meaningful CR when further treatment-related
toxicity should be minimized. It is important that future
trials of maintenance therapy incorporate measures of
patient quality of life prospectively and report adverse
events to offer a clear measure of benefits and costs associated with continued therapy.
In summary, by pooling results of many studies that
have investigated maintenance and consolidation treatments, we show that postremission therapy improves PFS
and OS in women with OC. Our findings that continued
therapy is associated with a 32% improvement in OS provide a strong rationale for continuing to address this concept in prospective, adequately powered trials. However,
the burden of continuation therapy will have to be
weighed against the anticipated clinical benefits. This burden may relate to treatment-related toxicity or to financial
costs associated with prolonged therapy. Anticipating that
the role of maintenance therapy will be ultimately proven
in the setting of a randomized clinical trial, the next

critical issue will be to identify the type of maintenance
intervention able to prevent cancer recurrence, while
avoiding toxicity and preserving quality of life.
