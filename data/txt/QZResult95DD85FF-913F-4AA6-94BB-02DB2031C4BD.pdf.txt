ABSTRACT
The mutation of T790M in EGFR is a major mechanism of resistance to treatment
with EGFR-TKIs. Only qualitative detection (presence or absence) of T790M has been
described to date, however. Digital PCR (dPCR) analysis has recently been applied
to the quantitative detection of target molecules in cancer with high sensitivity. In
the present study, 25 tumor samples (13 obtained before and 12 after EGFR-TKI
treatment) from 18 NSCLC patients with activating EGFR mutations were evaluated
for T790M with dPCR. The ratio of the number of T790M alleles to that of activating
mutation alleles (T/A) was determined. dPCR detected T790M in all 25 samples.
Although T790M was present in all pre-TKI samples from 13 patients, 10 of these
patients had a low T/A ratio and manifested substantial tumor shrinkage during
treatment with EGFR-TKIs. In six of seven patients for whom both pre- and post-TKI
samples were available, the T/A ratio increased markedly during EGFR-TKI treatment.
Highly sensitive dPCR thus detected T790M in all NSCLC patients harboring activating
EGFR mutations whether or not they had received EGFR-TKI treatment. Not only
highly sensitive but also quantitative detection of T790M is important for evaluation
of the contribution of T790M to EGFR-TKI resistance.

INTRODUCTION

detect target EGFR mutations in patients for appropriate
implementation of treatment with EGFR-TKIs.
Although treatment of patients positive for
activating mutations of EGFR with EGFR-TKIs has a
pronounced clinical benefit initially, such individuals
inevitably develop drug resistance, within ~1 year
on average [12, 13]. The mutation of threonine-790
to methionine (T790M) in EGFR is a major cause of
resistance to EGFR-TKIs, accounting for ~60% of patients
with resistance to these drugs [12-15]. T790M has also
been detected in specimens obtained from NSCLC patients
before treatment with EGFR-TKIs, with the detection rate
for the mutation being dependent on the sensitivity of
the technique [16-19]. These previous studies evaluated

Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has become
the standard care for patients with non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) positive for activating mutations of
EGFR [1-7]. Several methods based on the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR), such as the Scorpion amplification
refractory mutation system (ARMS), have been developed
for EGFR mutation screening and have a sensitivity
that allows the detection of a mutant allele fraction of
at least 1% (one mutant molecule in a background of
99 wild-type molecules) [8-11]. These laboratory tests
are now commercially available and are widely used to

T790M only with qualitative methods, however. Digital
PCR (dPCR) is based on the performance of PCR with a
single template molecule and is able to detect targets in a
quantitative and highly sensitive manner. This technique
has recently been applied to detect target molecules in
various cancer types [20-23].
We have now applied dPCR to the quantitative
and highly sensitive detection of T790M in specimens
obtained from NSCLC patients with activating EGFR
mutations either before or after (or both before and after)
treatment with EGFR-TKIs.

2012. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
Kyushu University.
The characteristics of the 18 patients analyzed
in the study are shown in Table 1. All patients had
adenocarcinoma positive for activating EGFR mutations
confirmed by a conventional PCR-based method. Eleven
of the 18 patients were positive for Ex19 del, and seven
were positive for L858R. The T790M mutation was also
detected by conventional PCR in specimens obtained from
two patients (nos.12 and 13) before EGFR-TKI treatment
(pre-TKI samples).
Seventeen patients received EGFR-TKI (gefitinib
or erlotinib, or both) treatment, whereas one patient
positive for T790M received only best supportive care
(no anticancer treatment). Of the 17 patients treated with
EGFR-TKIs, 13 (76.5%) achieved a partial response. The
treatment period for EGFR-TKIs ranged from 20 to 2644
days (median, 527 days).
A total of 25 tumor samples, including 13 preTKI and 12 post-TKI specimens, was obtained from the
18 patients in the study. Eighteen of the samples were
derived from pleural effusion, three from the primary
tumor, three from peritoneal effusion, and one from
pericardial effusion (Table 2). The samples consisted of 18

Highly sensitive detection and quantitative
evaluation of T790M by dPCR

Evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of
nanofluidic dPCR

With the use of the highly sensitive dPCR system,
we then evaluated the T790M status of the 25 samples

We examined the sensitivity and specificity of
nanofluidic dPCR for detection of the T790M mutation
of EGFR with known DNA samples corresponding to
wild-type (WT) or mutant (T790M) alleles of EGFR.
No positive signal for T790M was detected from any
of the 765 chambers when up to 1.0 × 104 copies of the
WT allele were applied to the digital panel as a negative
control (Supplementary Table 1). Application of 1.0 × 105
WT copies resulted in the appearance of 0 to 4 nonspecific
positive signals in eight replicates. With the use of Poisson
regression analysis, we defined the cutoff number of
positive signals as 3 (95% confidence interval, 0.85 to
2.64) for detection of T790M alleles in a sample including
1.0 × 104 to 1.0 × 105 WT alleles.
The relation between the known number of input
T790M alleles and the estimated number by dPCR was
linear for 1, 10, 100, and 1000 T790M alleles in a sample
including 1.0 × 104 WT alleles (Figure 1). These results
thus showed that the quantitative evaluation of T790M by
dPCR is reliable and has a sensitivity that allows for the
detection of a mutant allele fraction of 0.01% or more.

obtained from the study patients. dPCR detected T790M
in all of these 25 samples, including both pre-TKI (n = 13)
and post-TKI (n = 12) specimens (Table 2). In contrast,
ARMS detected T790M in only 15.4% (2 of 13) and
33.3% (4 of 12) of the pre-TKI and post-TKI samples,
respectively (Table 2). These data thus suggested that
dPCR was able to detect T790M present in a small
population of tumor cells at a frequency below the limit
of detection for ARMS.
We next evaluated the frequency of T790M in
pre-TKI samples. Representative results for one of these
samples (1-1-C) from a patient (no. 1) with the L858R
mutation of EGFR are shown in Figure 2A. We performed
duplicate assays [panels (1) and (2)] for detection of each
target allele [L858R, T790M, and control (a region of
EGFR exon 2)]. Chambers with a positive reaction are
indicated as red squares in a heat map for each of the 765
chambers, and the number of signals was counted by the
system software (raw data). The number of target alleles
included in the sample applied to the panels was estimated

from the raw data with the use of the Poisson distribution
(estimated number of target alleles), and the values for the
duplicate assays were summed [(1) + (2)]. By adjusting
the amount of input DNA in each reaction, we calculated
the ratio of the number of activating mutation (L858R) or
T790M alleles to the number of control alleles as follows:
L858R/control = (400 × 5.00)/(762 × 4.00) = 65.62% (a),
and T790M/control = (103 × 5.00)/(762 × 200) = 0.34%
(b).
To correct for the different proportion of cancer cells
and genetic heterogeneity in each sample, we calculated
the ratio of the number of T790M alleles to the number
of activating mutation alleles (T/A) as follows: T/A = b/a
= 0.34/65.62 = 0.52%. The T/A (%) values for all 13 preTKI samples are presented in Table 2 and Supplementary
Table 2. The results show that, with the exception of
two samples (12-1-C, 13-1-C), the T790M mutation was
much less frequent than activating mutations in pre-TKI
specimens.

patient (no. 1) either before (sample 1-1-C, pre-TKI) (A) or after (sample 1-2-C, post-TKI) (B) EGFR-TKI treatment. The assay was
performed in duplicate [panels (1) and (2)]. Chambers with a positive reaction are indicated as red squares in a heat map for each of the 765
chambers, and the number of signals was counted by system software (raw data).

Quantitative change in T790M frequency during
EGFR-TKI treatment

with activating EGFR mutations regardless of whether
the samples were obtained before or after EGFR-TKI
treatment. The estimated number of control alleles applied
to reaction panels for detection of T790M was limited
to <1.0 × 105 in all samples so as not to generate a false
positive result. Given that the estimated number of T790M
alleles was >3 when the applied number of control alleles
was >1.0 × 104 (Supplementary Table 3), the present study
was performed within the reliable range for specificity of
dPCR. The finding that T790M was present in all samples
is therefore not a false positive.
There are several possible explanations for the
higher detection rate of T790M in the present study
compared with previous studies. First, the DNA
analyzed in our study was evaluated by three techniques
(NanoDrop, Qubit, and ARMS) for determination of
an adequate and appropriate amount for application
to dPCR. Given that NanoDrop overestimates the
concentration of DNA, especially for tumor samples in
which DNA is partially degraded, the combination of
this system with measurement of double-stranded DNA
(dsDNA) by Qubit is helpful for evaluation of a suitable
amount of DNA for PCR [24]. The isolated DNA was
also evaluated in terms of the cycle threshold (Ct) value
obtained by ARMS, which provides a measure of DNA
quantity and suitability for PCR amplification. Second, we
used cytological specimens or frozen cell pellets, which
are free from the effect of formalin fixation on DNA
integrity. Formaldehyde has been found to induce both
the formation of cross-links between DNA and proteins
as well as fragmentation of DNA [25]. In our study, the
concentration of dsDNA obtained from formaldehyde-free
samples was thus adequate for PCR as reflected by the low
Ct values obtained by ARMS targeting the control allele

To evaluate the quantitative change in T790M
frequency during EGFR-TKI treatment, we also calculated
T/A (%) for post-TKI samples. Representative results for
a post-TKI sample (1-2-C) obtained from the same patient
(no. 1) as the representative pre-TKI sample are shown
in Figure 2B. We found that: L858R/control = (52 ×5.0)/
(1342 × 5.0) = 3.87% (c), T790M/control = (1014 × 5.0)/
(1342 × 200) = 1.89% (d), and T/A = d/c = 1.89/3.87 =
48.84%, indicating that the frequency of T790M alleles
increased during EGFR-TKI treatment in this patient. The
T/A (%) values for all 12 post-TKI samples are shown in
Table 2 and Supplementary Table 2.
Both pre-TKI and post-TKI samples were available
for seven patients (nos.1 to 7). These seven patients
received EGFR-TKI treatment for more than 10 months
with substantial clinical benefit (Table 1). In six (85.7%)
of these seven patients, the T/A value was greater after
EGFR-TKI treatment than before (Figure 3).

DISCUSSION
Up to 60% of individuals with NSCLC who develop
resistance to EGFR-TKIs have been found to harbor the
T790M secondary mutation of EGFR. This mutation has
also been detected in NSCLC patients before EGFRTKI treatment, however, with a detection rate ranging
from ~30% to ~80% depending on the sensitivity of the
detection technique [16-19]. In the present study, we
have demonstrated the presence of the T790M mutation
in all tumor specimens obtained from NSCLC patients

(Supplementary Table 4).
In our study, T790M was detected in all 13 preTKI samples, and 12 of the corresponding patients were
subsequently treated with EGFR-TKIs (Table 1). Ten of
these 12 patients (nos. 1 to 3 and 5 to 11) had a low T/A
value for the pre-TKI sample and experienced substantial
tumor shrinkage during treatment with gefitinib or
erlotinib (Tables 1 and 2), consistent with the previous
finding that gefitinib or erlotinib was effective for the
treatment of tumors estimated to have a low frequency of
T790M by ARMS [26]. Administration of first-generation
EGFR-TKIs such as gefitinib and erlotinib should thus not
be avoided in T790M-positive patients if the T/A ratio in
the pre-TKI sample is low. This conclusion is supported
by a previous in vitro study with PC9 cells, which harbor
an activating EGFR mutation (Ex19 del). The presence of
a small proportion of cells that also harbor T790M was
thus found not to substantially affect overall sensitivity to
erlotinib [27]. Sensitivity to erlotinib declined, however,
as the proportion of T790M-positive cells increased. In our
study, the T/A ratio increased during EGFR-TKI treatment
in six of the seven patients for whom both pre-TKI and
post-TKI samples were available. Our results thus support
the notion that tumor cells harboring T790M are present
in small numbers even before EGFR-TKI treatment, and
that these T790M-positive cells undergo selection and
enrichment during such treatment [26]. The presence
of T790M was likely responsible for the development
of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs in these latter six
patients of the present study. In the case of patient no. 5,
whose T/A ratio did not increase after failure of gefitinib
treatment, another resistance mechanism, such as MET
amplification, may have been operative and responsible
for resistance to the drug.
There are several limitations to our study. First, the
study is retrospective and has a small sample size. Second,
in most cases, cytotoxic chemotherapy was performed
between the collection of pre-TKI and post-TKI samples
(Table 1). The possibility therefore exists that the change
in the T/A ratio was not solely attributable to selection
of T790M-positive cells by EGFR-TKI treatment in
such cases. Third, most specimens were obtained from
metastatic lesions rather than from primary tumors, giving
rise to the possibility that our results may not reflect the
status of T790M in primary lesions. Finally, pre- and postTKI samples were obtained from different sites in several
cases, raising the possibility that the quantitative change
in T790M frequency may have been due to intratumoral
heterogeneity.
In conclusion, when highly sensitive methods
such as dPCR or next-generation sequencing (NGS) are
introduced into clinical practice in the near future, T790M
will be detected with a high frequency in NSCLC cases
positive for activating EGFR mutations regardless of
whether the patient has been treated with EGFR-TKIs
or not. Quantitative evaluation of T790M on the basis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of the T/A ratio will therefore be important to determine
whether T790M is likely to be responsible for EGFR-TKI
resistance in such patients. Given that high-coverage NGS
is also able to determine allele frequencies, a study that
applies both dPCR and NGS in more patients is warranted.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample preparation
Cells in C samples were scraped from the glass
slide with a surgical blade after removal of the cover slip
by overnight incubation in xylene. DNA was extracted
from the cells with the use of a QIAamp FFPE Tissue
Kit (Qiagen KK, Tokyo, Japan). Malignant effusion
specimens had been centrifuged at 630 × g for 10 min
at room temperature, and the cell pellets had been stored
at –80°C (F samples). DNA was extracted from these
samples with a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen KK)
according to the blood and body fluid spin protocol in
the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration and
purity of extracted DNA in all samples were determined
by spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000; Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). dsDNA was quantified
with the use of a Quant-iT dsDNA HS Assay (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and a Qubit fluorometer
(Life Technologies). The extracted DNA was stored at 4°C
until analysis.

Scorpion ARMS
We performed allele-specific PCR by Scorpion
ARMS with the use of a Therascreen EGFR RGQ PCR
Kit (Qiagen KK) as a conventional method to detect three
targets (control, activating mutations, and T790M). We
included 20 ng of DNA (as determined with NanoDrop) in
each reaction. A region of exon 2 of EGFR was amplified
as the control. ARMS reveals the number of PCR cycles
necessary to detect the target molecule present at the
beginning of the reaction. The cycle number at which
the signal is detected above background fluorescence is
defined as the cycle threshold (Ct). A sample is considered
to be positive for the target mutation if the difference
between its mutation Ct value and its control Ct value is
less than the cutoff value described in the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Nanofluidic dPCR
We used a nanofluidic dPCR system (BioMark HD
System; Fluidigm, South San Francisco, CA) with the
Fluidigm digital chip to quantitate target DNA molecules.
The digital chip delivers up to 12 mixtures of samples

and PCR reagents into 12 individual panels. Each panel
contains 765 independent 6-nl chambers. We estimated an
appropriate amount of DNA to be applied to each panel
that would yield positive signals in some but not all (n =
765) chambers on the basis of the Ct values of each target
allele obtained with ARMS. The individual target DNA
molecules become randomly distributed in the chambers
after their addition. ARMS was performed in each
reaction chamber targeting either control (region of exon
2), activating mutation (L858R or Ex19 del), or T790M
alleles of EGFR. After 35 cycles of PCR, the number of
signals obtained from successfully reacted chambers was
counted with the Fluidigm digital PCR analysis software
(raw data). The number of target alleles included in each
sample was then estimated on the basis of the raw data
with the use of the Poisson distribution, given that a
positive reaction in a chamber may correspond to multiple
target molecules.
