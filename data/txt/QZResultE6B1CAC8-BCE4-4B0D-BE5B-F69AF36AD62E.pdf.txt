Abstract
Polyinosine–polycytidylic acid [pIC] is a synthetic dsRNA that acts as an immune agonist of TLR3 and RLR
to activate dendritic and natural killer cells that can kill tumor cells. pIC can also trigger apoptosis in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDAC) but its mechanism of action is obscure. In this study, we
investigated the potential therapeutic activity of a formulation of pIC with polyethylenimine ([pIC]PEI) in
PDAC and investigated its mechanism of action. [pIC]PEI stimulated apoptosis in PDAC cells without
affecting normal pancreatic epithelial cells. Mechanistically, [pIC]PEI repressed XIAP and survivin expression
and activated an immune response by inducing MDA-5, RIG-I, and NOXA. Phosphorylation of AKT was
inhibited by [pIC]PEI in PDAC, and this event was critical for stimulating apoptosis through XIAP and survivin
degradation. In vivo administration of [pIC]PEI inhibited tumor growth via AKT-mediated XIAP degradation
in both subcutaneous and quasi-orthotopic models of PDAC. Taken together, these results offer a preclinical
proof-of-concept for the evaluation of [pIC]PEI as an immunochemotherapy to treat pancreatic cancer. Cancer

Introduction
Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers and
ranks fourth in cancer-related deaths in the United States
(1–4). Pancreatic cancer death rates have been increasing in
the United States over the past several years, as compared
with the downward trend in death rates for most other
major cancers (5, 6). The overall 5-year survival rate of
patients with pancreatic cancer is less than 6%, and this
dismal prognosis has not improved in recent years, resulting
in an increasing number of deaths (7). The high fatality of
pancreatic cancer is attributed to failure to diagnose the
disease early (before it has metastasized to other organs)
and resistance to current therapies (8).
Surgical removal of pancreatic cancer can cure a small
percentage of patients, but survival rates after pancreatectomy are extremely low (9). Chemotherapy or radiation used

alone or in combination, is only palliative and provides little
or no beneﬁt for patients suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer (10). The current FDA-approved cytotoxic treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer remains gemcitabine
(11). Even though gemcitabine is well tolerated, its efﬁcacy is
marginal with a median survival of 6 months. The combination of 5-ﬂuorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (FOLFIRINOX) showed superiority over single-agent
gemcitabine in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer
(from 6.8 months with gemcitabine to 11.1 months with
FOLFIRINOX; ref. 11). However, FOLFIRINOX had greater
toxicity, including grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, neuropathy, vomiting,
and fatigue (12). Considering its aggressiveness and lack of
currently effective therapies, a dire need exists for newer
strategies to treat pancreatic cancer. Characterization of
new activated oncogenic signaling pathways, deﬁning
molecular pathways involved in resistance and/or targeting
those genes involved in these pathways in pancreatic cancer
cells, may lead to more effective therapeutic strategies for
pancreatic cancer treatment (13–15).
The immune system plays a pivotal role in pathophysiology of pancreatitis and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma
(PDAC) development (16). Eukaryotic cells contain pattern
recognition receptors that detect viral/bacterial nucleic
acids activating antiviral immune responses (17, 18). Tolllike receptors (TLR) function as pattern recognition receptors and primary sensors of bacteria and viruses (19).
Activation of TLRs decreases expression of costimulatory
molecules on tumor cells, immunosuppressive functions
of regulatory T cells, and production of antiproliferative
cytokines (20). TLR agonists activate immune responses

[pIC]PEI Triggers Pancreatic Cancer Apoptosis via AKT/XIAP

promoting tolerance to tumor antigens and serve as adjuvants in cancer immunotherapy clinical trials (21).
Polyinosine–polycytidylic acid [pIC] is a synthetic dsRNA
directly activating dendritic cells and triggering natural
killer (NK) cells to kill tumor cells (22). [pIC] mimics viral
RNA serving as an agonist of TLR3 and RLRs, and has been
extensively used as an immune adjuvant in clinical trials
(23). Although [pIC] initiates apoptosis in several cancers, its
mechanism of action in human PDAC is not clear. [pIC]
induces high levels of type I IFNs and activates several
nuclear and cytoplasmic enzyme systems, including OAS
(oligoadenylate synthetase), the dsRNA-dependent protein
kinase (PKR), RIG-I Helicase, and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation associated gene-5) that are involved in antiviral
and antitumor host defenses (19, 23). Polyethylenimine (PEI)
is a promising reagent increasing transfection efﬁciency of
nucleic acids, including DNA, siRNA, or RNA, when administered in vivo (24). Complexing Jet-PEI with several DNA or
other vectors leads to a signiﬁcant increase in transfection
efﬁciency (25). When [pIC] is coadministered with PEI as a
carrier, [pIC]PEI, it profoundly affects cancer cell growth,
induces apoptosis and toxic autophagy, and promotes
potent immune modulating capacities (25–27). [pIC]PEI
induces toxic autophagy by recruitment of Atg-5 in melanoma cells linking toxic autophagy to apoptotic caspases
(25). In addition, [pIC]PEI decreases viability through apoptosis in breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo in tumor
xenograft models through activation of mda-5 (26). The
precise role of cellular intermediates and signaling pathways
involved in induction of apoptosis and toxic autophagy by
[pIC]PEI remains to be determined.
Our main objectives were to assess the biologic and
molecular effects of [pIC]PEI on human PDAC cells and to
decipher the mechanism(s) involved in its antitumor activity.
Cytoplasmic delivery of [pIC] using jetPEI induced pancreatic
cancer–speciﬁc cell death without affecting normal pancreatic epithelial cells. We linked for the ﬁrst time inhibition of
AKT activation followed by XIAP degradation as prime
mediators in cancer-speciﬁc cell killing by [pIC]PEI. Considering the absence of toxicity in vivo of [pIC]PEI and profound
cytotoxic activity on PDAC cells, use of this reagent, alone and
in combination with other therapeutic agents, could culminate in a novel, safe, and effective approach for treating
pancreatic cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Human PDAC cell lines (MIA PaCa-2, PANC-1, BxPC-3,
and AsPC-1) and the hTERT-HPNE cell line were purchased
from ATCC. LT-2 cell line was obtained from Millipore life
sciences. ATCC authenticates these cell lines using short
tandem repeat analysis. All the cell lines were expanded and
frozen immediately after receipt. The cumulative culture
length of the cells was less than 6 months after resuscitation.
Early passage cells were used for all experiments and they
were not reauthenticated. All the cell lines were frequently
tested for mycoplasma contamination using a mycoplasma

www.aacrjournals.org

detection kit from Sigma. Cell culture conditions and other
reagents are described in Supplementary Materials and
Methods.
Transfections with [pIC] using jetPEI
All treatments were performed using in vitro jetPEI (Polyplus
transfection) transfection reagent using the manufacturer's
protocol. Brieﬂy, [pIC] was mixed with jetPEI (1:2 ratio) in 500
mL of 150 mmol/L sodium chloride and left for 20 minutes to
allow complex formation, which was then added to cells in
fresh medium.
Plasmid transfection
Plasmid transfection experiments used FuGene HD transfection reagent using the manufacturer's protocol (Roche) and
are described in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Cell proliferation assays (MTT assay)
Cell growth rate was determined using a modiﬁed MTT
assay as described (28).
Colony formation assays
Cells were either mock treated or exposed to [pIC], PEI, or
[pIC]PEI for 48 hours. Cells were trypsinized and seeded (100
cells) in 6-well plates in triplicate. On Day 14 of incubation, cells
were ﬁxed in methanol, stained with Giemsa, and colonies (>50
cells) counted. Survival fraction was deﬁned as number of
colonies divided by number of plated cells.
LC3 assay
We used a previous protocol with minor changes (29)
as described in Supplementary Materials and Methods in
detail.
Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP
nick end labeling assay
Induction of apoptosis in PDAC cells treated with [pIC]PEI as
well as in xenograft tumor tissue sections of [pIC]PEI-treated
mice was detected using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) enzyme
reagent (Roche) following the manufacturer's instructions and
as described (30). Apoptotic index (%) ¼ 100  (apoptotic
cells/total cells) .
Annexin V assay
PDAC cells were mock treated or exposed to [pIC], or PEI
or [pIC]PEI for 48 hours. Cells were harvested through
trypsinization, and washed twice with cold PBS, resuspended in 1 binding buffer (100 mL) at a density of 1 to
10  l05 cells per mL. Cells incubated with 5 mL of FITCconjugated Annexin V and 5 mL of propidium iodide (PI) for
15 minutes at room temperature in the dark. The 1 binding
buffer (400 mL) was added, and the samples were analyzed by
ﬂow cytometry.
Real-time PCR
Cells cultured in 100-mm plates were mock treated or treated
with [pIC], PEI, or [pIC]PEI for 48 hours. Total RNA was extracted

using RNAeasy Kit (Qiagen) and equal amounts of RNA were
used for cDNA synthesis according to the manufacture's protocols using SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit (Applied
Biosystems). TaqMan probes for XIAP and survivin were from
Applied Biosystems and qRT-PCR was performed (28).
Western blotting
Western blotting analysis was performed as described
(28, 30).
In vivo studies
To directly evaluate the effect of [pIC]PEI on tumor growth
in vivo, we subcutaneously implanted 5  106 MIA PaCa-2
cells and tumors that developed received peri-tumoral injections of either [pIC], PEI, or pIC complexed with in vivo
JetPEI on 7, 11, 15, and 21 days posttumor cell implantation.
Tumor growth was monitored in mice by measuring tumor
size every alternate day until completion of the experiment
[sacriﬁced according to our Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee (IACUC) protocol]. After termination of the
experiment, tumors were ﬁxed and sections were used for
IHC analysis.
Quasi-orthotopic tumor studies
MIA PaCa-2-luc cells (5  106) were injected intraperitoneally into nude mice. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) was performed every week after tumor cell implantation. After 2 weeks
of cell implantation, mice were divided into two groups with 10
mice per group. One group was used as tumor growth control,
without any treatment, and the other group was injected twice
weekly with [pIC]PEI (1 mg/kg) i.p. (total of four doses). Control
and treated mice were observed for tumor progression using
BLI. All mice were sacriﬁced once mice either lost body weight
or developed impaired mobility.
Statistical analysis
All data are presented as mean  SD of at least three
independent experiments, each performed at least in triplicate.
One-way ANOVA combined with the Tukey posthoc test of
means was used for multiple comparisons. Statistical differences are presented at probability levels of P < 0.05, P < 0.01,
and P < 0.001.

Results
Cytosolic delivery of [pIC] using PEI selectively decreases
PDAC cell growth
Cytosolic delivery of [pIC] in human melanoma, breast
carcinoma, and hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo inhibits
growth and induces apoptosis and toxic autophagy (25–
27, 31). However, the precise mechanism(s) underlying these
effects are not fully understood. The effect of [pIC]PEI on
normal and PDAC cell growth was evaluated using MTT
assays (Fig. 1). Treatment of PDAC cells with [pIC]PEI
decreased proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner reaching 70% to 80% growth inhibition with 2 mg/mL
concentration at 72 hours as compared with either control,
pIC-, or PEI-treated cells. In contrast, normal immortal

6226

pancreatic epithelial cells (LT-2 and hTERT-HPNE) showed
minimal growth inhibition (8% maximum reduction at 72
hours) without any change in proliferation (Figs. 1A and B).
Clonogenic assays evaluated [pIC]PEI treatment on longterm survival and growth of pancreatic cells. [pIC]PEI treatment decreased PDAC colony formation (both size and
number) in a dose-dependent manner reaching 87%, 86%,
and 79% inhibition in MIA PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and PANC-1,
respectively, when compared with [pIC] (3% reduction),
PEI alone (4% reduction), or mock controls, without
altering LT-2 clonogenic ability (9% reduction; Fig. 1C).
[pIC]PEI induces autophagy in PDAC cells
Previous studies demonstrated that treatment of human
melanoma [25] or breast cancer [26] cells with [pIC]PEI
induces autophagy. Accordingly, we initially determined
whether [pIC]PEI transfection promoted autophagy in PDAC
cells. PDAC and HPNE cells were treated with [pIC], PEI, or
[pIC]PEI and cultured for 48 hours (Fig. 2). Cells were then
collected and cell lysates were assessed for autophagy markers LC3 and Atg-5. [pIC]PEI transfection increased LC3B
and Atg-5 levels in PDAC cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A and B), whereas HPNE cells did not show any
appreciable changes in either LC3B or Atg-5 level. To further
conﬁrm induction of autophagy, we assessed GFP-LC3 lipidation and foci formation in AsPC-1 cells following [pIC]PEI
treatment. GFP-LC3 lipidation and foci formation were
evident in [pIC]PEI-treated AsPC-1 cells versus nontreated
cells (Fig. 2C).
[pIC]PEI selectively induces apoptosis in PDAC cells
Flow-cytometric analysis was used to determine whether
growth inhibition in [pIC]PEI-treated cells was a consequence
of cell-cycle–related events and/or apoptosis. PI staining
indicated that [pIC]PEI treatment increased Sub-G1 apoptotic
cells by 56%, 42%, and 52% in MIA PaCa-2, AsPC-1, and
PANC-1, respectively, versus mock controls (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Annexin V and TUNEL assays corroborated these
ﬁndings (Fig. 3). Flow-cytometric analyses demonstrated
increased Annexin V-PI–positive PDAC cells (60%–70%)
following [pIC]PEI treatment, indicating increased cell death
(Fig. 3A). In addition, TUNEL positivity was increased in
PDAC following [pIC]PEI transfection, but not in normal LT-2
and HPNE cells (Fig. 3B). Western blotting analysis revealed
that [pIC]PEI treatment increased cleavage of caspase-3 and
PARP in PDAC but not in normal HPNE cells (Fig. 3C). To
conﬁrm the involvement of caspases in [pIC]PEI-induced
PDAC cell death, we used the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD,
which rescued PDAC from [pIC]PEI-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S2). These studies conﬁrm that [pIC]PEI
treatment inhibits PDAC cell growth by inducing apoptosis,
without inhibiting cell proliferation or inducing cell death in
normal pancreatic cells.
[pIC]PEI induces MDA-5, RIG-I, and NOXA in PDAC cells,
but not in normal pancreatic epithelial cells
[pIC]PEI induces MDA-5 and TLR-3 in melanoma cells, which
was critical for induction of toxic autophagy (25). In breast

cancer cells, knockdown of MDA-5 signiﬁcantly restored viability after transfection with [pIC], whereas knockdown of
TLR-3 did not protect cells (26). [pIC]PEI transfection in PDAC
increased RIG-I, MDA-5, and NOXA as compared with mock
controls (Fig. 4) with IFNb treatment as a positive control.
[pIC] or PEI did not signiﬁcantly change RIG-I, MDA-5, or
NOXA levels (data not shown). To conﬁrm further that [pIC]PEI
induces autophagy-mediated apoptosis in PDAC, we used the
autophagy inhibitor 3MA (25). Inhibition of autophagy with
3MA rescued PDAC from [pIC]PEI-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S2). The experiments with 3MA and z-VAD
indicate that [pIC]PEI treatment in PDAC, but not in normal
cells, induces autophagy followed by apoptotic cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S2).
[pIC]PEI triggers X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein
and survivin degradation in PDAC cells
Overexpression of the Bcl-2 family of antiapoptotic proteins

effective treatment (3, 4). X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis

protein (XIAP) overexpression is frequently observed in
PDAC and XIAP degradation or inhibition can sensitize PDAC
to apoptosis (12). On the basis of these considerations, the
effect of [pIC]PEI on the expressions of Bcl-2 family and other
relevant antiapoptotic proteins commonly overexpressed in
PDAC, including XIAP and survivin, were determined by
Western blotting. Treatment of PDAC with [pIC]PEI decreased
MCL-1, survivin, and XIAP levels (Fig. 5A and 5B), but did not
alter either XIAP or survivin in HPNE cells. Interestingly,
[pIC]PEI also increased the amount of the proapoptotic protein,
Bax (Fig. 5B).
Blocking XIAP degradation does not block apoptosis,
whereas overexpressing XIAP rescues [pIC]PEI-mediated
apoptosis in PDAC cells
[pIC]PEI transfection in PDAC decreased XIAP protein levels,
whereas RNA levels were not altered signiﬁcantly, suggesting
that XIAP degradation may be translationally or posttranslationally regulated (Supplementary Fig. S3). To determine
whether XIAP degradation plays a key role in [pIC]PEI-induced

enhanced the rescue of PDAC following [pIC]PEI treatment
(Supplemental Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results conﬁrm
that both XIAP and survivin contribute to [pIC]PEI-induced
PDAC death.

apoptosis. This phenomenon was conﬁrmed using TUNEL
analysis, which shows that MG132 did not rescue PDAC cells
from [pIC]PEI-induced death (Supplementary Fig. S4B). These
results suggest that an additional pathway(s) may contribute
to [pIC]PEI-induced cell death.
Overexpression of survivin partially rescues PDAC cells
from [pIC]PEI-mediated cell death
Survivin is overexpressed in PDAC (32) and provides a
biomarker for monitoring prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer. Our results demonstrate that [pIC]PEI dose dependently inhibits survivin expression in PDAC but not in HPNE
cells (Fig. 5A). To explore the relevance of this molecule in
[pIC]PEI-induced cell death, we transiently transfected PDAC
with a survivin expression plasmid and then treated with
[pIC]PEI. Overexpression of survivin in PDAC partially rescued
these cells from [pIC]PEI-induced cell death (Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S5B) As XIAP and survivin play signiﬁcant
roles in PDAC development, we determined the effects of
combined overexpression of survivin and XIAP on [pIC]PEI
treatment. Combination XIAP and survivin expression greatly

[pIC]PEI induces AKT-mediated XIAP degradation and
overexpression of AKT rescues PDAC cells from
[pIC]PEI-mediated cell death
Overexpression of XIAP plus survivin increases survival in
[pIC]PEI-treated PDAC. Treatment with MG132 suggests that
blocking XIAP degradation alone cannot rescue cells from
apoptosis. On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that upstream regulators of XIAP may play an important role in [pIC]PEI-induced apoptosis. Previous reports
suggest that phosphorylation of XIAP by AKT protects XIAP
from ubiquitination and degradation (33). We therefore
determined the levels of total AKT and its phosphorylation
upon [pIC]PEI treatment in PDAC. [pIC]PEI decreased the
levels of pAKT in three pancreatic cancer cell lines (AsPC-1,
MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1) as compared with [pIC], PEI, or
mock controls, whereas total AKT levels were unchanged
(Fig. 6A). To check the speciﬁcity of the [pIC]PEI effect on
PDAC, we also determined levels of pAKT and total AKT in
HPNE cells. [pIC]PEI did not alter the levels of pAKT or total
AKT in HPNE cells as compared with [pIC], PEI, or mock
controls (Fig. 6A).
To conﬁrm that AKT is an upstream modulator of XIAP,
PDAC cells were transiently transfected with an XIAP
expression plasmid for 24 hours and then treated with [pIC],
PEI, or [pIC]PEI for an additional 48 hours. Cell lysates were
prepared and subjected to Western blotting analysis for
XIAP and pAKT. XIAP overexpression in PDAC partially
rescued cells from [pIC]PEI-induced apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S5A), without substantially altering pAKT levels
(Fig. 6B). Similarly, when MG132 blocked [pIC]PEI-induced
XIAP degradation, pAKT levels remained unchanged (Fig.
6C). To conﬁrm further a role of AKT in [pIC]PEI-induced
PDAC death, cells were transiently transfected with a myrAKT for 24 hours and then treated with [pIC], PEI, or [pIC]PEI
for an additional 48 hours. Cells were collected, lysates
prepared, and Western blotting was performed to monitor
levels of pAKT, XIAP, survivin, and PARP cleavage. AKT
overexpression in the PDAC increased the levels of pAKT,
survivin, and XIAP, and rescued cells from [pIC]PEI-induced
cell death (Fig. 6D). TUNEL assay conﬁrmed that AKT
overexpression signiﬁcantly rescued PDAC cells from
[pIC]PEI-induced cell death (Supplementary Fig. S6). Taken
together, these results elucidate the downstream pathways
by which [pIC]PEI promotes cell death selectively in PDAC,
but not in normal pancreatic epithelial cells, demonstrating
that AKT serves as an upstream regulator of XIAP in
mediating [pIC]PEI anticancer activity.
[pIC]PEI mediates mTOR-PKC-«–mediated AKT
regulation in PDAC cells
Previous studies show that mTOR can regulate AKT in several
cancers (34). AKT has also been reported to be a downstream
effector of PKC-e in ethanol-induced cardioprotection, and

inhibition of PKC-e prevented the increase in AKT activity (35).
To deﬁne the effects of [pIC]PEI on mTOR-PKC-e link, we
performed Western blot analysis for mTOR and PKC-e. [pIC]PEI
transfection in PDAC decreased mTOR protein levels and
mTOR activation in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S7). We also showed that [pIC]PEI treatment of PDAC
decreased PKC-e in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6 and
Supplementary Fig. S7). Our results emphasize that PKC-e and
AKT act in a positive feedback loop, since AKT overexpression
led to an increase in PKC-e in PDAC cells (Fig. 6D). These
results suggest a potential role of mTOR-PKC-e in regulating
AKT following [pIC]PEI treatment, which warrant further
future investigation.

In vivo delivery of [pIC] using in vivo jetPEI decreases
human pancreatic tumor growth in subcutaneous and

MIA PaCa-2 (5  106) cells were subcutaneously injected
into male nude mice and when the tumor reached approximately 75 mm3, they were mock treated (PBS, control) or
treated with [pIC], PEI, or [pIC]PEI peri-tumorally and tumor
growth was monitored (Fig. 7A). A signiﬁcant decrease in
tumor volume and tumor mass was evident in mice receiving
[pIC]PEI as compared with mock-treated (PBS) control mice or
mice treated with [pIC] or PEI. Analysis of tumor mass and
volume showed approximately 90% inhibition in tumor growth
in [pIC]PEI-treated animals (Fig. 7B and C). To determine

whether [pIC]PEI also induced AKT- and XIAP-mediated apoptosis in vivo, tumor sections were prepared and IHC was
performed. IHC conﬁrmed downregulation of XIAP and survivin in [pIC]PEI-treated tumor sections when compared with
[pIC] or PEI alone or in control PBS-treated tumor sections
(Supplementary Fig. S8). TUNEL analysis for apoptosis in
tumors conﬁrmed enhanced TUNEL positivity in the
[pIC]PEI-treated tumor sections (Supplementary Fig. S8). Taken together, these results show that [pIC]PEI treatment in vivo
inhibits PDAC tumor growth through increased apoptosis as
evidenced by increased TUNEL and cleaved caspase-3 staining
and this effect is mediated through the AKT-XIAP pathway.
To conﬁrm further that [pIC]PEI could inhibit growth of
human PDAC in vivo, we used a quasi-orthotopic model in

which 5  106 MIA PaCa-2-luc cells were injected intraperitoneally into nude mice (Fig. 7D). After 2 weeks, mice received
[pIC]PEI IP and BLI monitored tumor growth. Mice were
sacriﬁced once control tumors reached the termination point,
as indicated by compromised health. The total pancreatic
region with tumors for each mouse was collected and weighted
(Fig. 7D). The pancreas in control group mice with tumors
weighted approximately 0.5 g, whereas the [pIC]PEI-treated
animals' pancreas weighted approximately 0.3 g (Fig. 7D). BLI
also showed high luminescence in control mice compared with
[pIC]PEI-treated animals (Fig. 7D). Taken together, these
results demonstrate that [pIC]PEI treatment signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor burden in a quasi-orthotopic pancreatic tumor
model.

Discussion
Pancreatic cancer remains one of the most difﬁcult cancers to treat effectively. Rapid progression of the disease and
diagnosis only after the primary tumor has metastasized are
factors contributing to the failure of current approaches to
mitigate this disease. Moreover, the lack of noteworthy
beneﬁts of current treatment modalities highlights the need
for innovative approaches to combat this invariably lethal
neoplasm. We presently demonstrate that delivery of [pIC]
into the cytosol using PEI selectively promotes PDAC apoptosis without affecting normal pancreatic epithelial cells.
This effect is observed both in cells in culture and in two in
vivo pancreatic cancer xenograft models, involving subcutaneous tumor injection and quasi-orthotopic intraperitoneal delivery of human PDAC. In addition, through a series of
hypothesis-based experiments, we deﬁne the mechanism of
this selective activity of [pIC]PEI, which involves AKT-medi-

ated XIAP degradation, resulting in apoptosis and toxic
autophagy uniquely in PDAC.
Ideally, optimum anticancer therapies should not alter the
immunologic status of cancer patients, but instead should
boost immune system responses because immunologic status signiﬁcantly impacts on therapeutic outcome of patients
with cancer (26). [pIC] has been used for decades as a
synthetic dsRNA mimic to enhance the immune system in
an IFN-dependent manner (25) and was tested in multiple
clinical cancer therapy trials. However, clinical trials with
naked [pIC] were not promising in melanoma because of
poor stability of [pIC] and IFN induction (25). [pIC] complexed with low-molecular weight poly-L-lysine, carboxymethylcellulose, liposomes, or PEI increased therapeutic
activity via IFN-dependent immune responses (25, 27). [pIC]
activates professional antigen-presenting cells, such as dendritic cells that secrete type-I IFN, resulting in effective

[pIC]PEI Triggers Pancreatic Cancer Apoptosis via AKT/XIAP

activation of NK cells (25). Interestingly, [pIC]PEI also displayed efﬁcient antitumor activity in animals with defective
NK, T, or B-cell signaling (25, 26).
[pIC] induces death in a panel of human cancer cell lines;
however, it is only in the last few years that receptors for pIC
recognition (MDA-5, TLR3, and PKR) have been discovered
(27). Transfection of [pIC] into human melanoma cells
induced cell death through the cytosolic [pIC] receptor,
MDA-5 (25). When [pIC] was delivered into the cytosol by
PEI, endogenous MDA-5 was induced, which facilitated
killing of melanoma cells by activation of NOXA. However,
when MDA-5 or NOXA was depleted, it did not abrogate cell
death completely following [pIC]PEI treatment, suggesting
the involvement of additional death mechanism(s). [pIC]
induced an IFN-independent proapoptotic signaling pathway that was activated by RIG-I and MDA-5 in normal cells
as well as in melanoma cells, which led to apoptosis only in
melanoma cells (27). Interestingly, primary cells were less
susceptible due to an intact Bcl-xL pathway, resulting in
preferential tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo in immune
deﬁcient mice. In hepatoma cells, [pIC]-liposomes induced
caspase-dependent apoptosis and upregulated RIG-I and
MDA-5 (31). Transfection of [pIC] into breast cancer cells
resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis by inducing
MDA-5 and TLR3 and selective knockdown of MDA-5, but
not TLR3, partially protected cells from the [pIC]. We show
that [pIC]PEI transfection selectively inhibits cell growth and
induces apoptosis in PDAC without affecting normal pancreatic epithelial cells. Moreover, [pIC]PEI transfection in
PDAC increased RIG-I, MDA-5, and NOXA both at the mRNA
and protein level, which is consistent with recent reports
(25, 27, 31). Apoptosis induction in PDAC is caspase dependent since using a pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD, rescued
PDAC from [pIC]PEI-induced cell death. In line with the
previous reports, we also found that [pIC]PEI induced autophagy in PDAC as evidenced by LC3 cleavage and Atg5
induction. Inhibition of autophagy by treatment with 3-MA
in PDAC reduced [pIC]PEI-mediated apoptosis.
IAPs are deregulated in PDAC and contribute to therapy
resistance (36, 37). XIAP and survivin are two essential
members of the IAP family, which are overexpressed in
numerous human malignancies, including PDAC, and predict
poor prognosis (38–43). Interestingly, [pIC]PEI treatment in
PDAC degraded survivin and XIAP in a dose-dependent
manner. Overexpression of survivin or XIAP individually in
PDAC resulted in partial resistance to [pIC]PEI treatment,
whereas overexpression in combination provided greater
resistance to [pIC]PEI. Although XIAP degradation contributes to [pIC]PEI-induced PDAC death, rescue of XIAP degradation by MG132 did not provide resistance to apoptosis.
AKT can phosphorylate XIAP at serine 87 in vitro and in vivo
and can also interact with XIAP (33). The XIAP phosphorylation at serine 87 by AKT inhibits its autoubiquitination and
ubiquitination functions promoting resistance to cisplatininduced XIAP degradation, caspase-3 activation, and apoptosis (33, 44, 45). AKT, also known as protein kinase B, is a
serine/threonine kinase involved in regulation of cell proliferation, survival/apoptosis, angiogenesis, metabolism, and

www.aacrjournals.org

protein synthesis (46). AKT plays a seminal role in various
cancers (47–53). [pIC]PEI treatment of PDAC decreased activation of AKT in a dose-dependent manner. A myristoylated,
constitutively active form of Akt (myr-Akt) rescued PDAC
from XIAP degradation and [pIC]PEI-induced apoptosis,
whereas XIAP overexpression failed to rescue inhibition of
AKT phosphorylation by [pIC]PEI. Taken together, these
studies suggest that AKT functions upstream of XIAP and
regulates degradation of XIAP, resulting in cell death. Interestingly, we found that [pIC]PEI treatment dramatically
decreases mTOR phosphorylation in PDAC in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, we found that [pIC]PEI treatment of
PDAC decreased PKC-e, which was shown previously to act in
a positive feedback loop with AKT (35). We plan to extend this
interesting observation in future studies.
In summary, we demonstrate that cytosolic delivery of
[pIC] using PEI in PDAC results in AKT-XIAP–mediated
apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. [pIC]PEI displayed strong
antitumor activity in immunodeﬁcient mice, using both
human pancreatic tumor xenograft and quasi-orthotopic
models, demonstrating that an intact immune system is not
mandatory for anticancer activity, supporting previous studies in melanoma (25, 27) and breast cancer (26). Apoptosis is
sequentially triggered by inhibition of AKT activation followed by XIAP degradation in [pIC]PEI-treated PDAC. This
conclusion is supported by the observations that AKT modulation regulated XIAP expression, but XIAP alteration did
not affect AKT expression. Our in vivo and in vitro experimental data suggest that [pIC]PEI may provide a clinically
relevant treatment strategy for aggressive and invariably fatal
pancreatic cancer.
