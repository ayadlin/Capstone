BACKGROUND. The superiority of new generation aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen in the adjuvant treatment of early breast carcinoma has emerged from
several randomized trials. However, until now not all previous studies have
shown a mortality benefit.

METHODS. A pooled analysis of 2 prospective multicentric trials, sharing the
same study design and nearly identical inclusion criteria, was performed. In both
trials, women treated previously with tamoxifen for 2 or 3 years were randomly
assigned to either continuing tamoxifen for an additional 2 or 3 years or to having their treatment switched to aminoglutethimide or anastrozole for a comparable time period. Mortality was analyzed according to allocated treatment and
other patient and tumor variables.

Early Switching Effect on Mortality/Boccardo et al.

1061

RESULTS. In all, 828 postmenopausal women, mostly with estrogen receptor (ER)positive and node-positive tumors who had been monitored for a median time of
78 months (range, 6–141 months) were analyzed. Of these women, 415 were randomly selected to continue tamoxifen and 413 switched to aminoglutethimide or
anastrozole. All-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality were significantly improved by the switch: all-cause mortality: hazard ratio (HR) ¼ 0.61 (0.42–
0.88) P ¼ .007; breast cancer-specific mortality: HR ¼ 0.61 (0.39–0.94) P ¼ .025. No
increase was recorded in breast cancer-unrelated mortality in women after switching. Multivariate analysis showed that patient age, tumor size, allocated treatment,
and nodal status, in that order, were independent mortality predictors.
CONCLUSIONS. Switching to an aromatase inhibitor after 2 or 3 years of tamoxifen
therapy significantly improves survival compared with continuing 2 or 3 years of
additional tamoxifen treatment. Cancer 2007;109:1060–7.

or many years tamoxifen has represented the gold
standard adjuvant treatment for endocrine-responsive early breast cancer.1,2 A recent article on the effect
of hormonal therapy on recurrence and 15-year survival of early breast cancer has confirmed that, for
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive women, about 5 years
of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy maintains a strong
effect on the risk of tumor recurrence and reduces the
annual breast cancer death rate by 31%.3 However,
even though there was a comparable effect on allcause mortality, resulting in an advantage in women
who had received tamoxifen vs those who had not,
there was also evidence that the prolonged use of this
drug might increase the death rate due to other
causes, such as vascular-related strokes or thromboembolic diseases, and other tumors other than
breast cancer.3
Several trials have shown that new generation
aromatase inhibitors can further decrease the risk of
recurrence in women with ER-positive breast cancer4–10 either when used upfront, instead of tamoxifen, or when given in sequence after 2 or 3 years of
tamoxifen therapy or at the end of adjuvant treatment with 5 years of this antiestrogen. These trials,
however, are not comparable to each other due to
the fact that they differ in design, trial size, patient
selection, aromatase inhibitor type and schedule, follow-up duration, and result maturity.
Nevertheless, a benefit of an additional 20% to
40% decrease in the recurrence risk has been reported
for women receiving upfront, sequential, or extended
treatment with an aromatase inhibitor compared with
those given or continued with tamoxifen. However, no
evidence of a comparable clinical benefit in mortality
reduction has emerged so far from the 2 extensive
studies that have demonstrated the superiority of
5-year upfront treatment with either anastrozole4 or

letrozole.5 In contrast to upfront studies, a small but
significant mortality benefit arises from the most
recent analysis of 2 of the 4 switching trials, including
a large multinational trial with exemestane.11,12 A
mortality benefit, especially in node-positive women,
also arises from the most recent analysis of the MA17 trial, although it appears to be limited to the
women in the placebo group who, after unblinding,
choose to be switched to letrozole.13
Since 1992 our group has been involved in developing a switching approach, as we presumed that this
strategy would be superior to the standard approach
of using only tamoxifen therapy. The benefit in mortality, favoring the switching strategy, was demonstrated by the first mature analysis of the former of
the 2 studies performed by us in this framework.14
The latter trial adopted the same design with anastrozole (ANA), a more potent aromatase inhibitor, in
place of aminoglutethimide (AG). The preliminary
analysis of this study showed a significant difference
between groups in relation to both event-free and recurrence-free survival in favor of the women who
switched to ANA. However, no statistically significant
mortality benefit was shown by this analysis.6
The purpose of this present study was to further
and fully investigate the effect of switching on patient
mortality by way of a pooled analysis of our 2 trials.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Trial Designs
The GROCTA 4B trial was conducted on 380 patients
who were enrolled between September 1992 and January 1998. The details of this trial, including the reasons for interrupting patient recruitment and the
results at a median follow-up time of 61 months, have
been previously published.14 The results were updated

1062

when the median follow-up time was 104 months
(range, 6–141 months) and mortality data utilized for
the present analysis. In summary, women on tamoxifen treatment for an average of 3 years were centrally
randomized to continue tamoxifen (TAM) at the same
dose as previously for a further 2 years or to receive
alternative treatment with AG at a daily dose of
250 mg for a comparable period of time.
The ITA trial, conducted between March 1998
and December 2002, enrolled 448 women according
to an identical design with ANA instead of AG at a
daily dose of 1 mg. The details of this latter trial
have also been previously published.6 The patient
mortality data utilized for the present analysis are
that of the most recent analysis (median follow-up
time, 64 months; range, 12–93 months) which forms
the subject of a separate publication.15
The pooled analysis of the 2 trials was prospectively planned at the time the ITA trial was designed.6

Patient Population
Postmenopausal women, including those who had
become irreversibly amenorrheic as a consequence
of previous chemotherapy, were entered into both
trials, provided they had ER-positive tumors. The
patients selected also had a node-positive disease
(even though a small proportion of ‘high risk’ nodenegative women were allowed to be recruited into
the GROCTA 4B trial) but no major contraindications
in receiving alternative treatment with AG or ANA. In
addition, they had to be able to guarantee an adequate compliance to the follow-up plan. Details can
be found in the previous publications.6,14
Ethical Aspects
All patients were informed about the experimental nature of the respective trials and were asked to give
their written consent. Both trials were approved by the
local Ethics Committee at each participating center.
Study Endpoints
Mortality, irrespective of the cause, was the primary
endpoint of the present analysis. Information about
the vital status of patients was obtained by way of
consulting flow charts of the women being monitored. Visits were scheduled every 3 months for the
first 3 years after the randomized selection, every 6
months from year 3 to year 5, and thereafter on an
annual basis. The vital status of women failing to
attend the clinic for more than 1 year, or who had,
for some reason, not been followed up, was checked
directly by phone and/or by consulting local tumor
registries if available, or the registry office of the
location of residence.

For the purpose of the present analysis, deaths
occurring after documented disease recurrence
were arbitrarily defined as ‘‘breast cancer-related,’’
whereas those occurring before disease recurrence
could be appropriately documented were defined
arbitrarily as ‘‘breast cancer-unrelated.’’ The causes
of death were recorded whenever possible.

Statistical Methods
Mortality curves were constructed using the KaplanMeier method16 and the groups compared by way of
the log-rank test.17 To evaluate the role of the main
prognostic factors, Cox proportional hazard models
were fitted to all-cancer mortality, breast cancer-related
mortality, and breast cancer-unrelated mortality.18
Assigned treatment, tumor size (2 cm vs
>2 cm), tumor grade (G1-G2 vs G3 vs Gx: undetermined or missing information), number of involved
nodes (zero vs 1–3 vs >3), treatment of primary
(mastectomy vs mastectomy plus irradiation of the
chest wall vs QUAD/tumorectomy plus axillary
dissection and irradiation of the residual breast),
prior adjuvant chemotherapy (no vs yes), and age
(<65 years vs 65 years) were the covariates
included in all models. All statistical tests were 2sided. In addition, survival plots were generated in
order to analyze data on both an individual trial basis
and both trial basis. SPSS software (v. 10.0 for Windows, Chicago, IL) was used for all statistical analyses.

RESULTS
The present analysis includes a total of 122 deaths in
828 women monitored for a median time of 78
months (range, 6–141 months). Four hundred and fifteen of these women had been randomly selected for
the continuation of tamoxifen and 413 switched to either AG or ANA. As shown in Table 1, treatment
groups were well-balanced with respect to age at randomization, tumor size and grade, nodal status, local
treatment, prior treatment with adjuvant chemotherapy, and median time on tamoxifen at randomization.
There were 74 deaths recorded in the women
allocated to continue tamoxifen, 51 of which were
breast cancer-related (according to the previous definition) and 48 deaths in the women who had
switched to either AG or ANA, 33 of which were
breast cancer-related. Causes of death are detailed in
Table 2. Mortality curves and mortality hazard reductions are reported in Figures 1A–C and 2.
All-cause mortality (HR ¼ 0.61 [0.42–0.88] P ¼ .007)
and breast cancer-related mortality (HR ¼ 0.61 [0.39–
0.94] P ¼ .025) was significantly improved in women
who switched to AG or ANA. On the contrary, even

though more women in the tamoxifen group appeared
to have died in the absence of obvious disease recurrence, there was no significant difference between
groups in breast cancer-unrelated mortality.
The probability of death increased over time both
for the women who died after breast cancer recurrence and for those who died before disease recurrence. However, the average time before death was
about double for women in the latter group compared

with those in the former group (average time before
death being 96 and 54 months, respectively).
Multivariate analysis (Table 3) shows that patient
age, tumor size, allocated treatment, and nodal status, in that order, were independent predictors of
the risk of dying for all the patients monitored.
Tumor size, nodal status, and allocated treatment

tion was the only statistically significant predictor of
breast cancer-unrelated mortality.

DISCUSSION
This pooled analysis has several strengths. It was
planned ‘a priori’ at the time the ITA trial was designed

and with regard to the 2 trials performed by 1 collaborative group sharing the same design and comparable
selection criteria. In addition, it includes a relatively
large number of patients (more than 800) and the median follow-up time was quite long for both studies
included. Thus, the results are quite mature.
However, it must be said that the study suffers
from weaknesses as well. Both our trials were concluded without having reached the planned recruitment size and, therefore, we note that each of them
lacks the adequate statistical power to correctly
analyze the impact on mortality of switching. The
reasons for trial closure have been detailed previously.6,14 However, it is not to be undervalued that
the slow recruitment rate and the availability of a
new, more potent aromatase inhibitor like anastrozole played a major role in interrupting recruitment
in the GROCTA4B trial. The problem of ‘slow recruitment’ was also a reason for trial closure in the case
of the ITA trial.6 However, in this case we should also
consider the role played by the interim analysis of efficacy performed by our group soon after the release
of the preliminary results of the ATAC trial, showing
the superiority of switching to anastrozole. This interim analysis prompted trial investigators to consider that it might no longer be ethical to allow trial
entry. However, they decided to keep the patients
randomly assigned to tamoxifen on this antiestrogen,
first, because only 33% of these patients were still
receiving this treatment and most of them were
expected to discontinue it within a few months and,
second, due to the very preliminary nature of the
results achieved by available trials with aromatase
inhibitors and the lack of any actual evidence of
mortality benefit.4,7,10 The lack of a strict standardization of treatment for recurring patients might be a
further source of bias for a mortality analysis, as in

our case. However, administering an aromatase inhibitor to patients relapsing after 5 years of tamoxifen is not likely to represent a major confounding
factor in this case. In fact, 32% of the women who
continued with tamoxifen in the GROCTA 4B trial
received an aromatase inhibitor on recurrence. It is also
worth noting that 27% of the women who switched to
AG were also rechallenged with an endocrine treatment
(including third-generation imidazolic or steroidal aromatase inhibitors) on recurrence in this trial. Comparative figures are not available for the women recruited to
the ITA trial. However, both trials were performed by the
same collaborative group and there is very little risk, if
any, that treatment policy of recurring patients might
have changed from 1 trial to the other. Moreover, the
results of the most recent overview of adjuvant tamoxifen trials show a clear carryover effect of the tamoxifen
treatment also with respect to mortality, suggesting that
the survival advantage seen in these patients is more
likely to be the early use of tamoxifen rather than that
related to the treatment selected at the time of recur-

rence.3 Finally, AG was employed in the GROCTA 4B
trial. This drug is no longer used in the treatment of
breast cancer and, given the low dose employed in our
previous trial, it should be expected to be much less
effective than a more potent and selective compound
like ANA, the inhibitor tested in the ITA trial.
This might explain the different effect of switching on breast cancer-related mortality observed in the
2 studies, and the finding that this effect was greater
and statistically significant only for the patients who
switched to anastrozole in the ITA study.
Although the number of breast cancer deaths
recorded so far in this trial was smaller than in the
GROCTA 4B trial due to the shorter duration of follow-up, it is worth noting that there was no difference
between the 2 studies in the interaction of treatment
with the aromatase inhibitor, either AG or ANA, with
breast cancer-related mortality. In fact, a clear benefit
of breast cancer-related mortality was achieved by
switching in both trials. It is also of importance to
consider that both all-cause and breast cancer-related

mortality benefits achieved by switching were still statistically significant even after multivariate analysis by
patient age, tumor size and grade, nodal status, and
prior local and/or systemic treatment.
The analysis of breast cancer-unrelated mortality
is more complex for several reasons. First, because,
as previously noted, the 2 trials differ in their median
duration of follow-up. This aspect might be crucial
for this type of estimation as we have shown that,
overall, median time to death for women who apparently died in the absence of proven disease recurrence was about double that of women who died
after breast cancer recurrence. Second, because cardiovascular events represent the actual and sole
cause of death reported on most death certificates, it
might well be that in both trials breast cancer-related
deaths have been misclassified and the incidence of
cardiovascular deaths has been overestimated. In
addition, the lack of information on most of the
patients enrolled in our 2 trials on factors such as,
for example, being overweight, diet, smoking habits,
physical activity, hypertension, and diabetes, which
are recognized as risks of cardiovascular mortality,
might also represent a further source of bias. On the
basis of what has been previously reported for longterm tamoxifen trials,19,20 one would expect that
switching from tamoxifen to an aromatase inhibitor
would imply a decrease in death due to strokes.
Indeed, this was the case in the combined analysis.
However, we also observed fewer cardiovascular
deaths among women who switched to the aromatase
inhibitor and, more important, there were fewer lethal
cardiac ischemic events, in spite of the progressive
increase in plasma cholesterol levels reported in these
women in the ITA trial6 (this information was not
available for the GROCTA 4B trial women).
Our findings in this regard should be considered
with particular caution both on the basis of the small
numbers involved and the previous considerations,
together with the finding that instead a higher incidence of cardiac ischemic deaths was reported by
BIG-98 trial investigators.5
However, it should not be underestimated that
no increase in cardiac ischemic events was reported
in any of the other adjuvant trials with aromatase
inhibitors reported so far.4,6–13 Recently, a reduced
risk of acute myocardial infarction or angina among
tamoxifen users resulted from a nested case-control
study reported by Bradbury et al.21 Even on the basis
of these findings, and of the known hypolipidemic
effects of tamoxifen,22,23 one would expect more ischemic cardiac deaths among the women who
switched to the aromatase inhibitor in our trials.
However, the Bradbury et al study shows that the

protective effect of tamoxifen was statistically significant only in current tamoxifen users. In both our studies, all patients randomized to continue tamoxifen
had discontinued this treatment at the time of the
present analysis and it is worth noting that the slight
increase in breast cancer-unrelated mortality risk
observed in the ITA trial among the women switched
to ANA was exclusively due to just 1 more death
caused by a homicide.
In conclusion, this pooled analysis provides solid
evidence that switching to an aromatase inhibitor after a few years of tamoxifen treatment implies a mortality benefit over continued tamoxifen and that the
benefit on breast cancer-related mortality is mainly
due to the effect of switching. Although the numbers
are small and the findings are likely to be less reliable in this regard, our analysis also appears to
exclude that switching might result in an increased
risk of death for causes other than from breast cancer, namely, for cardiovascular events.
The present data and mortality benefits emerging from the most recent reports of the other
switching trials,11,12 together with those from a
recent metanalysis of the 3 switching trials with ANA
(which includes the ITA trial as well),24 reinforce the
indication of early switching to an aromatase inhibitor in women presently receiving adjuvant treatment
with tamoxifen.25
