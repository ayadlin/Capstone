ABSTRACT
Intratumoral heterogeneity and treatment resistance drive breast cancer (BC)
metastasis and recurrence. The RUNX2 transcription factor is upregulated in early
stage luminal BC. However, the precise mechanism by which RUNX2 regulates an
oncogenic phenotype in luminal BCs remains an enigma. We show that RUNX2 is
predictive of poor overall survival in BC patients. RUNX2 associated with the TAZ
transcriptional co-activator to promote a tumorigenic phenotype that was inhibited
by knockdown of TAZ. RUNX2 increased endogenous TAZ translocation to the nucleus,
which was prevented by inhibiting RUNX2. RUNX2/TAZ interaction was associated
with ectodomain shedding of an oncogenic soluble E-Cadherin fragment (sE-Cad),
which is known to cooperate with human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2/
ErbB2) to increase BC growth. Neutralizing E-Cadherin antibodies or TAZ knockdown
reduced the levels of sE-Cad in RUNX2-expressing BC cells and inhibited tumorsphere
formation. RUNX2 expression also increased HER2-mediated tumorsphere size, which
was reduced after treatment with the HER2-targeting agents Herceptin and lapatinib.
These data support a novel role for RUNX2 in promoting an oncogenic phenotype in
luminal BC in the context of TAZ, sE-Cad, and HER2. Using this signaling pathway to
monitor BC cell oncogenic activity will accelerate the discovery of new therapeutic
modalities to treat BC patients.

highly responsive to treatment. Given their high rate of
relapse, it is clear that current treatment modalities are
insufficient to completely eradicate these heterogeneous
tumors. The HER2-targeting agent trastuzumab is only
FDA-approved for use in patients whose tumors are
clinically defined as HER2-enriched. However, early
clinical trials have shown a 50% reduction in recurrence
rates in patients with luminal BC treated with combination

INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease [1, 2]
and despite advances in treatment, it remains the second
leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women [3].
Luminal BC has the highest rates of relapse, often localizes
to the bone [1, 4], and accounts for 50% of all metastaticrelated BC deaths [5] in spite of the primary tumor being

trastuzumab/chemotherapy over patients treated with
chemotherapy alone [6]. Since ductal carcinomas in situ
(DCIS) express HER2 prior to a transition to an invasive
phenotype, there may be clinical benefit to treating BC
with HER2-targeted agents even in the absence of HER2
gene amplification.
RUNX2, an osteoblast differentiation transcription
factor, is expressed in developing breast epithelial cells
and is enriched in the mammary stem cell population
responsible for terminal end bud differentiation [7, 8].
In basal-type breast cancer cell lines RUNX2 promotes
an osteomimetic phenotype and metastasis to the bone
through transcriptional activation of osteopontin, MMPs,
and VEGF [9–11]. The RUNX2 oncogenic program can
be stimulated through a variety of signaling pathways [12,
13] that include cooperation with TGFβ/Smad signaling
[14–17]. RUNX2 is also expressed in early stage estrogen
receptor positive (ER+) BC above normal levels found in
the breast epithelia [18, 19]. However, its role in regulating
luminal BC has yet to be elucidated. RUNX2 was recently
shown to be upregulated in a subpopulation of luminal A
MCF7 cells that share molecular characteristics with a
more invasive BC phenotype, including genes associated
with stem cell renewal and enhanced tumorsphere-forming
capacity [20]. Whether it is a direct regulator of these
tumorigenic programs was not determined. The RUNX2
binding partners, YAP (Yes-associated protein) [21] and
TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding
motif) [22] are WW domain-containing transcriptional
coactivators that promote cell transformation [23],
osteogenesis [22], or stem cell self-renewal [24, 25].
TAZ is a nuclear effector of the Hippo tumor suppressor
pathway that has been implicated in promoting BC
progression [26], but its cooperative interaction with
RUNX2 in BC has yet to be elucidated. Disruption of
cell:cell contacts (Hippo pathway inactivation) results
in reduced phosphorylation of TAZ leading to nuclear
translocation and interaction with transcription factors
that regulate expression of cell proliferation and antiapoptotic genes [27]. TAZ is upregulated in 20% of BC
patients [28] and is expressed in many breast cancer cell
lines [26] where it has been shown to increase migration,
invasion, tumorigenesis, drug resistance, and to promote
an EMT [29]. TAZ and RUNX2 have been independently
implicated in mediating metastasis to the bone [9, 30] but
a cooperative role in BC has not been reported.
Although an epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) in BC is characterized by downregulation of
E-Cadherin [31–33], it is becoming increasingly clear that
cells may also disseminate from the primary tumor without
undergoing an EMT or down-regulating E-Cadherin
expression [20, 34, 35]. An alternative pathway involving
the proteolytic processing of the N-terminus of E-Cadherin
(120 kDa), which results in the release of an ectodomain
soluble oncogenic fragment (sE-Cad; 80 kDa), has been
reported to mediate migration, invasion, and proliferation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

while maintaining epithelial morphology in cancer cells
[35–40]. The proteolytic processing of E-Cadherin is
regulated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and ‘A
Disintegrin and Metalloproteinase s’ (ADAMs) including
but not limited to MMP2, MMP9, and ADAM15 [35,
40–45]. MMPs and ADAM proteases secreted from tumor
and stromal cells target full length E-Cadherin N-terminal
of the transmembrane domain, resulting in the release of
the intact extracellular domain. The remaining membranebound and intracellular domains have been shown to be
further proteolytically processed, but, the function of these
domains is poorly understood. sE-Cad is an autocrine and
paracrine factor that promotes survival and metastatic
progression by interacting with HER2/ErbB receptors
[35, 38, 40, 46, 47]. In addition, sE-Cad binds full length
E-Cadherin resulting in the destabilization of adherens
junctions [35]. sE-Cad has been proposed as a functional
metastatic biomarker in many cancers [35, 37, 39, 48, 49]
including, but not limited to, BC [48]. We now report that
RUNX2 expression in luminal BC cells results in nuclear
TAZ localization and expression of sE-Cad. We found
that TGFβ enhances the RUNX2-mediated expression of
sE-Cad and upregulation of HER2. RUNX2 associated
with TAZ in the nucleus and knockdown of TAZ inhibited
RUNX2-mediated tumorsphere formation, which was
also dependent on HER2 activation. Inhibition of RUNX2
with a novel RUNX2-targeting compound (CADD522)
inhibited tumorsphere formation without affecting RUNX2
control cells. Furthermore, downregulation of RUNX2
levels with CADD522 inhibited sE-Cad production and
TAZ nuclear localization in RUNX2 overexpressing cells.
These results suggest that RUNX2:TAZ and activation
of sE-Cad/HER2 signaling could be potential oncogenic
pathways for a BC population of RUNX2 positive cells
with metastatic potential.

RESULTS
RUNX2 expression and function in luminal BCs
To test the hypothesis that RUNX2 might regulate
the tumorigenic phenotype of luminal BC cells, RUNX2
expression was examined in patients diagnosed with early
stage luminal BC (Figure 1A). RUNX2 protein expression
was associated with poor prognosis after diagnosis (overall
survival; P = 0.017) in those patients with high RUNX2
levels (>2 SD; median survival 80 months) compared to
patients with lower levels of RUNX2 protein (<2 SD;
median survival 117.5 months). To define models of
luminal BC, several cell lines were examined for RUNX2
expression. Variable levels of endogenous RUNX2
protein were detectable in luminal MCF7, HCC1428,
and T47D BC cells (Supplementary Figure S1A). To
examine its oncogenic function, we expressed RUNX2
in the luminal BC cell line, MCF7, under the control
of a Tet.OFF promoter (Supplementary Figure S1A).

RUNX2 expression in the MCF7 Tet.OFF model
increased attachment to fibronectin, extracellular matrix,
and increased invasion through an endothelial cell (EC)
monolayer (Figure 1B). Culture of BC cells in suspension
is a model of anchorage-independent growth and may
define a transformed BC cell phenotype (tumorspheres)
[50]. We showed recently that shRNA knockdown of
RUNX2 in triple negative BC cells inhibited tumorsphere
formation [51]. Consistent with these results, inducible
RUNX2 expression (doxycycline –) in MCF7 cells
resulted in tumorspheres that were significantly larger
(3.6-fold; p < 0.001) than MCF7 cells in which RUNX2
expression was repressed (doxycycline +) especially in
the presence of TGFβ (Figure 1C). It is well-established
that TGFβ exhibits both tumor suppressive and tumor
promoting activities. In the presence of an oncogenic
factor, TGFβ functions to promote tumor growth; while
in most normal cells (absence of an oncogenic factor)
TGFβ inhibits cell proliferation and restrains tumor
formation [26]. Smad proteins, downstream nuclear
effectors of TGFβ signaling, are also known to cooperate
with RUNX2 to potentiate tumorigenesis. Treatment of
RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells with TGFβ resulted
in larger tumorspheres (18.83 ± 3.08) relative to control
cells expressing low RUNX2 (5.31 ± 3.21) (Figure 1C).
In fact, in the absence of RUNX2 overexpression, MCF7
control cells were inhibited by TGFβ treatment, as evident
by a decrease in tumorsphere diameter (8.69 ± 1.41
relative to 5.31 ± 1.68) (Figure 1C). Therefore, in luminal
BC cells, RUNX2 mediates an oncogenic phenotype that
is characterized by increased attachment to extracellular
matrix, invasion, and anchorage-independent growth.
To validate that tumorsphere growth was RUNX2
dependent, cells were treated with an inhibitor of
RUNX2:DNA binding (Figure 2A) that was discovered
by computer assisted drug design (CADD) to interact
with the RUNX2 DNA-binding pocket [52]. The
CADD522 compound was able to dose dependently
inhibit transcriptional activity of a RUNX2 regulated
promoter, 6XOSE2.Luciferase, while having no effect on
an unrelated NFκB.Luciferase reporter gene activated by
TNFα (Figure 2B). RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells
were treated with CADD522 in suspension. This RUNX2
inhibitor significantly decreased the diameter of RUNX2
overexpressing MCF7 tumorspheres (17.21 ± 5.28 to 4.83 ±
1.87; p < 0.001) by almost 4-fold relative to vehicle-treated
cells (Figure 2C). RUNX2 control cells were unaffected
(6.98 ± 2.89 to 6.37 ± 1.78; P = 0.209). Therefore, RUNX2
is necessary for luminal BC cell tumorsphere formation.
RUNX2 protein stability is regulated by phosphorylation,
which promotes DNA binding [53, 54]. When RUNX2
is not bound to DNA, it is either targeted to subnuclear compartments [55] or rapidly degraded [56]. To
determine whether inhibiting RUNX2 DNA binding and
transcriptional activity altered the levels of RUNX2 we
treated RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells or T47D cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

overexpressing RUNX2 with the CADD522 compound.
CADD522 reduced RUNX2 protein levels in both MCF7
and T47D cells (Figure 2D). In MCF7 cells, RUNX2
protein levels were reduced about 8-fold after 24 hr
treatment (reduction of 90%) and greater than 95% after 48
hr. In RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells (doxycycline –)
that were re-treated with doxycycline (doxycycline +) to
repress RUNX2 expression (Supplementary Figure S1B,
upper panel), CADD522 was able to further reduce RUNX2
protein levels below control cells (Figure 2D, lane 6).
Untreated RUNX2 overexpressing cells (doxycycline –)
maintained high levels of RUNX2 over a 72 hr period
(Supplementary Figure S1B, lower panel ). In T47D cells,
RUNX2 protein levels were reduced about 2-fold after 48
hr confirming that targeting RUNX2 DNA binding can alter
RUNX2 levels in vivo. In summary, the ability of luminal
BC cells to form tumorspheres is dependent on RUNX2
since tumorsphere size was reduced in cells treated with
a compound that inhibits RUNX2 protein levels, DNA
binding, and transcriptional activity.

Role of RUNX2 cofactor TAZ in anchorage
independent growth
The Hippo signaling effectors, TAZ and YAP,
are important RUNX2 transcriptional cofactors that
interact with the coactivator/corepressor domains
located in the C-terminus of RUNX2 [23]. YAP
expression in RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells
was low and levels in response to RUNX2 did not
change in these cells (Supplementary Figure S1C).
However, nuclear TAZ levels were 80% higher upon
induction of RUNX2 expression (doxycycline –)
compared to control cells (doxycycline +) (Figure 3A,
compare lane 9 to 7). Disruption of cell:cell contacts with
EGTA resulted in additional increases in TAZ nuclear
levels (lanes 11 and 12) with a concomitant decrease
in cytosolic TAZ (lanes 5 and 6). Immunoprecipitation
of TAZ showed that RUNX2 and TAZ were associated
within the same immune complex only in RUNX2
overexpressing MCF7 cells treated with TGFβ (Figure
3B). To determine if RUNX2 and TAZ cooperatively
promote tumorsphere formation, RUNX2 Tet.OFF MCF7
cells were transfected with scrambled siRNA or three
specific siRNAs targeting TAZ. TAZ knockdown to
levels 70–80% (siRNA1), 50–70% (siRNA2) or 20–30%
(siRNA3) of control (scrambled siRNA) was observed
in cells expressing either low (doxycycline +) or high
(doxycycline –) RUNX2 (Figure 3C). Tumorsphere
formation of RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells
(doxycycline –) was inhibited by all three TAZ-specific
siRNAs over 12 days (Figure 3D). Although significant
(p = 0.001 and p = 0.006), TAZ siRNA#1 (4.85 ± 2.11)
and siRNA#2 (5.16 ± 1.91) knockdown produced a modest
decrease in tumorsphere size compared to controls (6.97
± 2.89 for TGFβ treated and 7.18 ± 2.98 for scrambled)

and represent the difference between RUNX2 and Tag2a empty vector transfection (inset Western blot, left panel). NIH3T3 cells were

in RUNX2 control cells (doxycycline +). TAZ siRNA#3
had no significant effect in the control cells. However,
TAZ siRNA #1, 2, and 3 (4.43 ± 1.47, 5.35 ± 2.42, and
6.05 ± 3.12 respectively) inhibited tumorsphere formation
2.5 to 4-fold in the RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells
compared to controls (17.21 ± 5.28 and 13.97 ± 3.81 for
TGFβ and scrambled controls respectively). Interestingly,
a 20% reduction in TAZ protein levels (Figure 3C) was
sufficient to significantly decrease tumorsphere formation
by 65% in RUNX2 overexpressing cells (p < 0.001) while
having no effect in RUNX2 control cells. Further, reducing
RUNX2 expression in the RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7
(doxycycline –) cells with the CADD522 compound
(Figure 2D) lowered TAZ nuclear levels within 24 hr
(Figure 3E; doxycycline –). However, CADD522 treatment
of RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells (doxycycline –)
that were re-treated with doxycycline (doxycycline +) to
repress RUNX2 expression (Supplementary Figure S1B,
upper panel) had no effect on nuclear TAZ levels over
a 72 hr time course (Figure 3E, lane 6). This suggests
that the decline in TAZ levels upon CADD522 treatment
requires RUNX2 expression. Similarly, in HCC1428
BC cells expressing endogenous RUNX2, treatment
with CADD522 led to an 80% reduction in nuclear TAZ
levels compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 3E,
HCC1428). In summary, RUNX2 interaction with TAZ
is necessary to promote TAZ nuclear translocation and/or
retention and tumorsphere formation.

Cad released by the MCF7 Tet.OFF cells were similar
in RUNX2 overexpressing and RUNX2 control cells
at t = 0. Generation of sE-Cad is dependent upon the
expression of MMPs and ADAM proteases [35]. RUNX2
has been shown to control transcription of numerous
MMP genes and extracellular matrix molecules [10].
Relative to control MCF7 cells, RUNX2 overexpressing
cells showed several-fold enrichment for MMP genes
(Supplementary Figure S1E), some of which (MMP2) are
known to target E-Cadherin for proteolytic processing.
In addition, the expression of other MMPs and ADAM
proteases was also upregulated in RUNX2 overexpressing
cells (MMP11, MMP12, MMP16, and ADAMTS8).
Interestingly, the expression of extracellular matrix
genes laminin and collagen I (a RUNX2 target) were
increased while expression of the anti-tumor and antiangiogenic matrix protein thrombospondin was repressed.
To determine if the production and secretion into the
conditioned media of sE-Cad in RUNX2 overexpressing
MCF7 cells was dependent upon the activity of MMPs,
we treated cells with the broad spectrum MMP inhibitor,
o-Phenanthroline. In the presence of o-Phenanthroline,
sE-Cad levels were decreased to the levels present in
RUNX2 control cells (Figure 4B). E-Cadherin and
sE-Cad are neutralized using the ectodomain-specific
E-Cadherin antibody, DECMA-1 [46]. To determine
if sE-Cad mediated RUNX2-dependent tumorsphere
formation, we treated RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7
cells with DECMA-1. Tumorsphere size was significantly
inhibited in RUNX2 overexpressing (doxycycline –)
cells treated with DECMA-1 over 10 days (7.85 ± 3.11;
p < 0.001) compared to TGFβ and IgG controls (13.06 ±
5.16 and 14.88 ± 4.14 respectively) indicating RUNX2
overexpressing cells rely on sE-Cad for tumorsphere
formation (Figure 4C). However, DECMA-1 promoted
larger tumorsphere formation in RUNX2 control
(doxycycline +) cells, perhaps through its ability to
prevent full length E-Cadherin-dependent growth
suppression, thus increasing cell proliferation, which
is consistent with published reports [58]. To determine
whether inhibition of RUNX2 protein levels and
transcriptional activity would prevent the generation
of sE-Cad, MCF7 Tet.OFF cells were treated with the
RUNX2-selective drug CADD522. CADD522 treatment
increased sE-Cad production 3.5-fold within the first 24 hr
of treatment, but sE-Cad levels declined almost 20-fold
by 72 hr in RUNX2 overexpressing cells (Figure 4D).
Baseline levels of sE-Cad were significantly higher in
RUNX2 overexpressing (doxycycline –) cells prior to
CADD522 treatment (P = 0.02). A 2-fold decrease in sECad production in RUNX2 control cells (doxycycline +)
(Figure 4D) may be due to CADD522 inhibition of
endogenous RUNX2 or of low amounts of RUNX2
produced by the Tet.OFF system even in the presence of
doxycycline (Figure 2D; Supplementary Figure S1A).
Further, siRNA-targeted knockdown of the RUNX2
cofactor TAZ also resulted in a 50% reduction (p = 0.02)

Production of oncogenic E-Cadherin ectodomain
(sE-Cad) is dependent on RUNX2 and TAZ
The EMT can be regulated by RUNX2 in some BC
cells [57]. However, in luminal BC cells, RUNX2 did not
promote the loss of E-Cadherin, the downregulation of
ER or the expression of N-Cadherin and Vimentin, which
are indicative of an EMT progression (Supplementary
Figure S1D). Instead, RUNX2 expression was associated
with a 129% increase in oncogenic E-Cadherin
fragment, sE-Cadherin (sE-Cad; 80 kDa) consisting
of the E-Cadherin ectodomain (Figure 4A). RUNX2
overexpressing MCF7 cells expressed 2.3-fold more sECad in response to TGFβ treatment (48 hr), compared to
RUNX2 control MCF7 cells (Figure 4A, boxes 1 and 2).
sE-Cad protein levels were reduced after treatment with
the Ca+2-chelator EGTA suggesting that sE-Cad was
associated with the cell surface. sE-Cad is an established
biomarker for metastatic prostate cancer [37, 39] and
has been found in the conditioned media of DU145
prostate cancer cells where it promotes tumorigenesis and
mediates invasion [37]. Conditioned media from MCF7
cells expressing RUNX2 contained 2.2-fold higher levels
of sE-Cad ectodomain compared to RUNX2 control
cells (Figure 4B). In contrast to cells overexpressing
RUNX2, after 48 hr treatment with TGFβ there was a
20% reduction in sE-Cad secreted into the conditioned
media by RUNX2 control cells. Baseline levels of sEwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Therapeutic targeting of sE-Cad/HER2 signaling

of sE-Cad ectodomain levels without affecting RUNX2
levels (Figure 4E). Therefore, MCF7 cells produce
endogenous sE-Cad, its levels can be modulated by the
expression of RUNX2 and TAZ, and expression of sECad ectodomain mediates tumorsphere formation in
RUNX2-expressing luminal BC cells.

The ErbB2/HER2 receptor family member is
expressed in a subset of luminal BC cells in the absence of
gene amplification [6] and HER2 is one of the main targets

A. RUNX2 increases the production of sE-Cad associated with the cell surface in response to TGFβ. MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were grown

with with 1 mM glucose and 2% FBS (t = 0) and then treated for 48 hr with 2 ng/mL TGFβ with or without EGTA (0.5 mM or 1 mM).
Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were analyzed by western blot and probed with antibodies for E-Cadherin (120 kDa = full length; 80 kDa
= sE-Cad), FLAG (RUNX2; 60 kDa), and β-Actin (42 kDa). Changes in sE-Cad protein levels were determined by quantifying the lower
E-Cadherin band using NIH ImageJ normalized to β-actin. Red boxes in the gel correspond to the same numbered white-hashed boxes in the

Conditioned media from MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were collected following a 16 hr starvation in D5030 supplemented with 1 mM glucose
and 2% FBS (t = 0) or after treatment with 2 ng/mL TGFβ for 48 hr with or without 500 μM o-Phenanthroline. Conditioned media were
immunoprecipitated using E-Cadherin antibody. Proteins were eluted from beads and separated by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot with
antibodies to detect full-length (120 kDa) and sE-Cad (80 kDa). Changes in sE-Cad protein levels were determined by quantifying the lower
E-Cadherin band using NIH ImageJ. Protein levels are expressed as fold change relative to RUNX2 control MCF7 cells (+ dox; – TGFβ).
C. sE-Cad mediates tumorsphere formation in RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells. MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were plated in 6-well ultralow attachment plates with 2 ng/mL TGFβ. Cells were then treated with DECMA-1 (green bars) or IgG control (purple bars) or untreated (yellow
bars) for 10 days. Cells were photographed and tumorsphere sizes were measured from photographic images (mm) and diameters graphed.

Cytoplasmic fractions were obtained and analyzed by western. Proteins were visualized using antibodies against E-Cadherin (Full length

of sE-Cad [59]. HER2 interacts with sE-Cad to promote
ligand-independent cell signaling in HER2-enriched
BC cells, but its role in luminal BCs (in the absence of
gene amplification) is undefined [1, 2, 60]. We showed
recently that overexpression of RUNX2 increased Akt
phosphorylation in MCF7 cells [51]. Since HER2 is known
to activate downstream signaling involving Akt [59, 61],
the levels and tumorsphere-forming potential of HER2 in
RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7 cells was determined. After
48 hr treatment with TGFβ, RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7
cells contained almost 2-fold higher HER2 levels than
RUNX2 control cells (Figure 5A, boxes 1 and 2) suggesting
that RUNX2-mediated production of secreted sE-Cad
(Figure 4A) may stabilize HER2. Inhibition of sE-Cad levels
at the cell surface with EGTA (E-Cadherin destabilization
to remove sE-Cad bound at the cell surface; Figure 4A,
box 3) correlated with a decrease in HER2 to levels observed
in RUNX2 control cells (Figure 5A, box 3). To test for
functional HER2, the effect of HER2-targeted agents on
tumorsphere formation was determined. The Herceptin
monoclonal antibody binds the extracellular domain of
HER2, promotes receptor internalization and degradation,
prevents homo/heterodimerization, and mediates antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity [60]. Herceptin inhibited
tumorsphere formation in RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7
cells by 2-fold (11.91 ± 4.65 to 5.76 ± 2.83; p < 0.001),
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

without affecting tumorsphere formation in RUNX2 control
cells (6.25 ± 2.68 to 7.2 ± 3.27; P = 0.145) (Figure 5B).
Isotype-matched IgG had no impact on tumorsphere size.
Lapatinib is a small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase
inhibitor that interacts with the intracellular kinase domain
of HER2 to inhibit receptor activation [60]. RUNX2
overexpressing MCF7 cells were sensitive to lapatinib
treatment, with tumorsphere size reduced by 2.5-fold relative
to vehicle control over 15 days (13.48 ± 4.87 to 5.68 ± 1.78;
p < 0.001) (Figure 5C). Lapatinib did not affect tumorsphere
formation of RUNX2 control cells (6.99 ± 1.67 to 6.08
± 2.38). These results are consistent with a cooperative
function for HER2 and sE-Cad in promoting a tumorigenic
phenotype in luminal BC cells expressing RUNX2.

DISCUSSION
Luminal BCs include ductal carcinoma in situ
(DCIS), which is the most commonly diagnosed BC
that accounts for 50% of metastases. Although primary
DCIS are easily detected and treated, they are extremely
heterogeneous and can recur years after treatment.
Transcriptional activation is one mechanism generating
heterogeneity, maintaining a tumor-initiating (stem cell)
phenotype, and promoting metastasis [62]. The RUNX2
transcription factor is expressed in luminal BCs as well

as cell lines and appears to support a stem-like and
oncogenic phenotype [20]. Previous studies suggested
that RUNX2 can interact with Hippo pathway signaling
cofactors to promote anchorage-independent growth [23].
Therefore, to test the hypothesis that RUNX2 promotes
an oncogenic phenotype by cooperating with the Hippo
tumor suppressor pathway transcriptional modulator TAZ,

several luminal BCs were examined. RUNX2 expression
supported a TGFβ-driven oncogenic signaling pathway
that involves TAZ-mediated activation of tumorsphere
formation, the production of soluble E-Cadherin
(sE-Cad), and cooperation with HER2, which was
increased in RUNX2 expressing cells. The data indicate
that sE-Cad cooperates with HER2 and sensitizes BC cells

to HER2-targeted drugs. These luminal BC cells expressing
RUNX2 appear to rely on HER2 signaling to potentiate
their tumorigenic phenotype. The effects on tumorsphere
formation are consistent with known roles for RUNX2
and TAZ in tumor-initiating functions. These results have
identified several therapeutic targets that converge on
RUNX2:TAZ transcriptional regulation in BC cells. The
combined signaling pathways may be responsible for a
transcriptional program that mediates BC tumorsphere
formation and anchorage-independent growth (Figure 6).
A better understanding of how these components promote
oncogenesis may lead to the development of better
therapeutic agents to target multiple components of this
signaling cascade to inhibit metastatic disease.
The function of RUNX2 in early stage luminal BC
is not completely understood, although it is known to
exhibit either tumor suppressive or oncogenic activity,
depending on expression of ER [63]. The RUNX2 gene
and protein are upregulated in early stage BC tissue [7, 8,
18, 20, 64] and there is evidence for a luminal BC subpopulation that expresses RUNX2 [20]. There are many
possible approaches to target transcription factors for
cancer therapy [65]. Using a new RUNX2-targeting agent
that was designed to inhibit RUNX2 DNA binding [52,
66], we took a direct approach to inhibiting RUNX2 in
BC cells. Although attached cells were not affected (data
not shown), cells in suspension were sensitive to RUNX2
targeting. The CADD522 compound reduced the levels of
RUNX2 protein in two different BC cells and prevented the
accumulation of nuclear TAZ, the production of sE-Cad,
and tumorsphere formation. Previous studies had shown
that TAZ-regulated tumorigenic events, which silence
the Hippo pathway, are activated by TGFβ signaling
and TEAD transcription factor interactions [26]. Our
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

results show that TGFβ treatment and RUNX2 induction
results in Hippo inactivation, which is characterized by
increased TAZ nuclear translocalization and interaction
with RUNX2. Since growth in suspension increased with
RUNX2 expression, while TAZ knockdown reduced
anchorage-independent growth, the results are consistent
with a cooperative interaction between RUNX2 and TAZ to
promote tumorsphere formation. TAZ is the transcriptional
cofactor that interacts with RUNX2 in the bone to mediate
osteoblast differentiation [22]. Therefore, it is possible
that tumor cells hijack this developmental partnership to
prime BC cells for homing, implantation, and survival in
the bone. This could account for the high bone metastatic
recurrence rate observed clinically in luminal BC cases
[67]. TAZ is an active oncogene when it translocates to
the nucleus where it can upregulate genes responsible for
stem cell maintenance and metastasis. It may also be a
viable therapeutic target [68]. Although TAZ knockdown
inhibited tumorsphere formation almost completely in
RUNX2 positive cells, TAZ also was essential for growth
in suspension of MCF7 cells in which RUNX2 was not
induced (Figure 3D). This may reflect the endogenous
subpopulation of cells that already express RUNX2 [20]
and which may also use TAZ as a cofactor to promote
tumorsphere formation. In addition, it is possible that in
some cells TAZ interacts with other nuclear transcription
factors such as TEAD or p73 [27]. However, reduced TAZ
nuclear levels in response to CADD drug (Figure 3E) in
RUNX2 expressing cells suggest that TAZ may associate
poorly with other nuclear factors such as TEAD to mediate
nuclear localization when RUNX2 is expressed. Overall
these results indicate that Hippo signaling and the RUNX2
cofactor TAZ are involved in anchorage-independent
growth and tumorsphere formation in luminal BC cells.

Figure 6: Inactivation of the Hippo tumor suppressor pathway by RUNX2 promotes a tumorigenic phenotype in
luminal BC cells. The Hippo tumor suppressor pathway is active (left side) in the context of s-Cadherin interactions that promote
epithelial cell:cell polarity. Under these conditions, E-Cadherin signaling maintains TAZ phosphorylation (gray circle) and localization in
the cytosol. Upon induction of oncogenic events (right side), which include sE-Cad production and cooperation with HER2 receptors, the
Hippo pathway is inactivated promoting TAZ translocation (black hashed arrow) to the nucleus where it can interact with transcription
factors, such as RUNX2, which are responsible for activation of genes that promote cell invasion, survival, and tumorsphere formation.
Several therapeutic targets are indicated (pink) that inhibit the tumorigenic phenotype described in this study (tumorsphere formation),
including Herceptin/Lapatinib targeting of HER2, DECMA-1 targeting of sE-Cad, and CADD522 targeting of RUNX2.

Cell migration and invasion of surrounding
stroma contributes to tumor metastasis, which is
often accompanied by an EMT. RUNX2 increases the
expression of the EMT inducer SNAI2 [57]. Concomitant
reduction of epithelial markers such as E-Cadherin and
ER define an EMT in some cells [32, 33, 57]. However,
loss of E-Cadherin and an EMT is not necessary to
observe metastasis [34]. RUNX2 disrupted E-Cadherin
cell:cell junctions but did not promote a classic EMT in
ER-positive MCF7 cells (Supplementary Figure S1D).
E-Cadherin is a known tumor suppressor that promotes
cell:cell contacts and is sensitive to proteolysis [34].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

While E-Cadherin is a defined tumor suppressor that is
inactivated by transcriptional or promoter methylation
mechanisms [69], the shed soluble ectodomain (sE-Cad)
exhibits oncogenic activity [61] and its levels increased in
RUNX2+ cells. EGTA (a calcium chelator used to disrupt
E-Cadherin hemophilic adhesion) or treatment with the
broad spectrum MMP inhibitor o-Phenanthroline inhibited
sE-Cad formation indicating that cell:cell adhesion
and proteolytic processing is necessary for production
and retention of sE-Cad on the cell surface. RUNX2
overexpressing cells were characterized by increased
MMP and matrix gene expression (Supplementary
28143

Oncotarget

Figure S1E), some of which are known E-Cadherin
generators (MMP2) and others which have not been
shown to mediate proteolytic processing of E-Cadherin
(MMP11, MMP12, and MMP16). Therefore, in RUNX2
overexpressing cells an MMP-driven mechanism might be
responsible for sE-Cad production. Whether these MMPs
directly regulate sE-Cad in luminal BC cells will require
further mechanistic studies. DECMA-1 neutralizing
antibody targets both full-length E-Cadherin and the sECad ectodomain. In RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells, DECMA-1
increased tumorsphere size in low RUNX2 expressing
cells, consistent with other findings that neutralizing
antibodies targeting E-Cadherin stimulate MCF7 growth
[58] by inhibiting its tumor suppressor function. Blocking
full-length E-Cadherin in RUNX2 control cells could
have also resulted in a functional EMT leading to the
observed increase in tumorsphere size [70]. However,
DECMA-1 also inhibited RUNX2 overexpressing MCF7
cells resulting in smaller tumorspheres, consistent with
inhibition of the oncogenic sE-Cad ectodomain. Since
CADD522 treatment increased sE-Cad levels after 24
hr treatment (Figure 4D), the results are consistent with
reduced sE-Cad turnover or shedding in the presence of
the RUNX2 inhibitor, perhaps as an adaptive response.
However, the eventual decline in sE-Cad levels with
CADD522 treatment could be the result of lower RUNX2
protein and transcriptional activity, which may be essential
for promoting MMP driven sE-Cad generation.
HER2 is amplified in a subset of ER-/PR- BCs [1, 2,
60] and has also been shown to be expressed in a subset of
luminal BC cells in the absence of gene amplification [6].
The ErbB/HER2 receptor family is one of the main targets
of sE-Cad signaling and HER2 interacts with sE-Cad to
promote ligand-independent cell signaling [59]. HER2targeting, therefore, may also inhibit tumors that shed the
E-Cadherin ectodomain, sE-Cad, by inhibiting downstream
signaling initiated through this ligand-independent HER2
receptor activation. HER2 was expressed (non-amplified)
in MCF7 cells and MCF7 cells expressing RUNX2 were
sensitive to HER2-targeting agents. These data indicate
that HER2/ErbB2 is, therefore, functional in RUNX2
overexpressing MCF7 cells. Ithimakin and colleagues
used a series of luminal cell lines, mouse xenograft
experiments, and patient tumor data to show that HER2selective agents (trastuzumab) may have clinical benefit
among a broad group of patients, even those without
HER2 gene amplification [6]. Furthermore, it was found
that BC cells expressed HER2 in metastatic bone lesions
without the presence of amplification similar to what is
observed in patients with RUNX2 and TAZ expressing
tumors [9–11, 29, 30]. In summary, current results support
a model consistent with production of sE-Cad in RUNX2
expressing cells and cooperation with HER2 to promote a
tumorigenic phenotype. Therefore, RUNX2 and sE-Cad
could be potential biomarkers for a currently undetectable
subpopulation of cells within luminal BCs that express TAZ
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and HER2. This subpopulation could benefit from RUNX2
and HER2-targeting agents, which may be a more effective
treatment modality in preventing recurrence and metastasis
to the bone years after initial diagnosis and treatment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
The MCF7 BC cell line with inducible RUNX2
expression (ER+ MCF7) was prepared using the BD™
Tet-Off System (BD Biosciences). MCF7-RUNX2 cells
are ER+ and express wild type p53, PTEN, c-myc, and
ras, but do not express p16. MCF7 cells containing tTA
(Tetracycline-controlled transactivator) regulatory vector
(G418 resistant) were purchased from Clontech (Mountain
View, CA), infected with retroviral vectors expressing Flagtagged RUNX2, and selected with 200 μg/ml hygromycin
B. Cells were frozen within three passages and maintained
in DMEM (Corning) containing 10% Tet-Approved FBS
(Clontech) and the antibiotics G418 (100 μg/ml; Sigma),
hygromycin B (200 μg/ml; Roche), and doxycycline
(2 μg/ml; Sigma) to repress RUNX2 expression (+Dox).
To express RUNX2, cells were grown in the same media
but in the absence of doxycycline (–Dox) for 72 hours
to achieve maximal RUNX2 protein levels. T47D and
HCC1428 luminal BC cells were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA) and were a kind gift from Dr. Stuart Martin
(University of Maryland). They were maintained in RPMI
(Corning) containing 10% FBS (Gemini; #100-106) with
1% Pen/Strep (Gemini; #400-109). T47D luminal BC
cells were also supplemented with 0.2 Units/mL bovine
insulin (Sigma; #I0516). To validate EMT markers, the
triple negative Hs578t BC cells were obtained from ATCC
(Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM (Corning)
supplemented with 5% FBS (Gemini) and 1% Pen/Strep
(Gemini). NIH3T3 cells were passaged less than 20 times
and maintained in DMEM (Corning) supplemented with
10% FBS (Gemini) and 1% Pen/Strep (Gemini).

Suspension culture/tumorsphere formation
To measure anchorage-independent growth, MCF7RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were grown in the presence (+Dox,
RUNX2 negative) or absence (–Dox, RUNX2 positive) of
doxycycline for 3 days. Cells were then scraped and counted.
60,000 cells were plated in each well of a 6-well ultra-low
attachment plate (Corning; #3471) in Promocell Basal
Medium (Promocell; c-22211) complete with Supplement
Mix (Promocell; c-39216). Cells were treated with or without
2 ng/mL TGFβ (R&D Systems; #240-B-002). After growth
for 10–15 days, cells were photographed and tumorsphere
diameters were measured from photographic images (mm).
Colony diameters were calculated using the formula:
(L+W)/2. Representative photographs were obtained at 4X
magnification. Other treatments included: 50 μM CADD522
(ChemBridge Corporation; 5221975), 20 μg/mL DECMA-1

transfected into the NIH3T3 cells with X-tremeGENE.
Cells were treated with 5 μM, 10 μM, or 25 μM CADD522
at the time of transfection for 24 hours. Luciferase assays
were performed using the Promega Dual-Glo® system
(Madison, WI; #E1960), and luciferase activity was
measured in 96-well plates with the Berthold Centro LB
960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold Technologies,
GE). Data were analyzed and normalized to Renilla
luciferase and pGL3.Luc control vector. Background
luciferase values from Tag2a empty vector transfection
were subtracted from RUNX2 expressing NIH3T3 cells.
The NFκB.Luciferase promoter-reporter plasmid was a
kind gift from Dr. Hancai Dan (Department of Pathology)
at the University of Maryland, Baltimore. NIH3T3 cells
were transfected with NFκB.Luciferase (100 ng) and
10 ng pTK Renilla in 24-well plates at 30,000 cells/well
using X-tremeGENE transfection reagent. Cells were
treated overnight with 20 ng/mL TNFα (Cell Signaling,
#8902SC) to activate NFκB signaling with or without
10 μM CADD522 and luciferase activity was measured.
Data were analyzed and normalized to Renilla and pGL3.

Western blot and antibody protocols
MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were grown to
subconfluence in the presence (RUNX2 negative) or absence
(RUNX2 positive) of doxycycline for 72 hr in full media as
described above. Cells were then treated in minimal DMEM
(Sigma, D5030) containing 0.1%BSA, 1% L-glutamine, 2%
Tet-Approved FBS, and 1 mM glucose for 16 hours followed
by treatment with 2 ng/mL TGFβ (R&D Systems, #240-B002) for 48 hours in the presence or absence of EGTA to
examine sE-Cad expression levels, TAZ localization, and
HER2 expression levels. Cells were washed with PBS and
scraped from plates. Cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates were
obtained using the Low/High Salt extraction method [66].
Cytoplasmic extracts were obtained by resuspending cells
in NP40 containing Hypotonic Buffer (10 mM HEPES pH
7.4, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0.5% NP40) followed
by 30 min incubation on ice and centrifugation. Nuclear
extracts were obtained by resuspending the nuclear pellet
in an equal volume of low salt buffer (10 mM HEPES, 25%
glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 20 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA)
followed by high salt buffer (10 mM HEPES, 25% glycerol,
1.5 mM MgCl2, 800 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA) followed
by vortex, 30 min incubation on ice, another vortex,
and centrifugation. Samples were resolved on 4–12%
Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gradient gels (Invitrogen) and
transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore, IPVH00010).
Membranes were probed with antibodies listed below
followed by development with enhanced ECL (Millipore,
WBKLS0500). Proteins were visualized using antibodies
recognizing: E-Cadherin (Abcam, HECD-1, ab1416), YAP/

Image-J software.

Immunoprecipitation/co-immunoprecipitation
assay (IP/Co-IP)
Conditioned media were collected from MCF7 cells
cultured in the presence (RUNX2 negative) or absence
(RUNX2 positive) of doxycycline in minimal DMEM
(Sigma, D5030) containing 0.1% BSA, 1% L-glutamine,
2% Tet-Approved FBS, and 1 mM glucose for 16 hours
followed by treatment with 2 ng/mL TGFβ (R&D Systems,
240-B-002) for 48 hours. Conditioned media were
carefully removed from cells and remaining cellular debris
was removed by centrifugation. Conditioned media protein
levels were estimated using the Bradford assay. 200 μg of
protein was suspended in 200 μL Co-IP buffer (50 mM
Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA,
1% Triton X-100, 0.5% NP-40) and pre-cleared in 20 μL
of a 50% slurry of Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare,
17-0618-01) for 30 minutes. Pre-cleared supernatants
were then incubated overnight with 0.5 μg of E-Cadherin
antibody (Abcam, HECD-1, ab1416). Protein G-Sepharose
was added for 1 hour and the precipitated complexes were
washed with Co-IP buffer. Proteins were eluted from the
beads using 0.1 M Glycine buffer (pH 2.4), treated with
1X SDS loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol,
and heated at 97°C for 10 min. Samples were resolved
on a 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and
transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Immunoblots
were probed for E-Cadherin (Abcam, HECD-1, ab1416)

nuclear lysates were obtained using NucBuster (Novagen,
#71183-3) from MCF7 cells grown in the presence
(RUNX2 negative) or absence (RUNX2 positive)
of doxycycline in minimal DMEM (Sigma, D5030)
containing 0.1%BSA, 1% L-glutamine, 2% Tet-Approved
FBS, and 1 mM glucose and 2 ng/mL TGFβ for 4 and
24 hours. Briefly, 400 μg of protein was resuspended
in Co-IP buffer to a final volume of 200 μL. Lysates
were precleared with 35 μL of a 50% slurry of Protein
G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 hr. Pre-cleared nuclear
lysates were then incubated with 4 μL of YAP/TAZ
antibody (Cell Signaling) overnight. Protein G-Sepharose
was added for 1 hour and the precipitated complexes were
washed with Co-IP buffer. Proteins were eluted from the
beads using 0.1 M Glycine buffer (pH 2.4), treated with
1X SDS loading buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol,
and heated at 97°C for 10 min. Samples were resolved
on a 4–12% Bis-Tris polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen) and
transferred to PVDF membranes (Millipore). Immunoblots
were probed for RUNX2 (Cell Signaling, D1L7F, #12556),
and YAP/TAZ (Cell Signaling, D24E4, #8418) followed by
development with enhanced ECL (Millipore). To visualize
the TAZ protein band a conformation specific rabbit
secondary antibody was used (Cell Signaling, L27A9,
#5127). Rabbit IgG and beads alone were used as Co-IP
controls.

levels were normalized to actin and quantified using NIH
Image-J software.

CADD522 drug treatments
The CADD522 compound (MF = C15H13Cl2NO3) has
a molecular weight of 326.175, a high LogP value of 3.25
(logarithm of its partition coefficient between n-octanol
and water, a measure of the compound's hydrophilicity
with low hydrophilicity = high LogP), a low LogSW of
–4.35 (measure of aqueous solubility), three rotatable
bonds, a hydrogen bonding donor/acceptor ratio of
2/3 (Hdon/Hacc), a polar surface area of 66.4 (tPSA;
indicative of good cell membrane permeability), and an
IC50 of 10 nM in D-ELISA DNA binding assays [52].
MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were pretreated in the
presence (RUNX2 negative) or absence (RUNX2 positive)
of doxycycline for 3 days. RUNX2 transiently transfected
T47D or HCC1428 breast cancer cells were grown in
media that was then replaced with full media (as listed
in cell culture section) and treated with or without 50 μM
CADD522. Cells were allowed to grow for 24, 48, and
72 hours. Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained
using the High/Low salt extraction method and protein
levels were analyzed by Western blot (see above).

Attachment and invasion assay
Tissue culture plates were coated with Fibronectin
(1 μg/ml), extracellular matrix (ECM; from endothelial
cells cultured to confluence and treated with 5 mM EDTA
to remove cells), or with confluent endothelial cells (human
bone marrow endothelial cells). MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.OFF
cells were grown in the presence (+Dox, RUNX2 negative)
or absence (–Dox, RUNX2 positive) of doxycycline for
3 days and were then added to the indicated plates for
120 min in minimal media (Sigma, D5030) containing
0.1% FBS, 5 mM glucose, and 2 ng/ml TGFβ. The number
of cells/field attached to Fibronectin, ECM, or endothelial
monolayer was counted from 3–4 fields/well.

siRNA mediated knockdown of TAZ
TAZ knockdown was performed in MCF7RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells using Custom 23 mer desalted
siRNA oligonucleotides from Sigma and a Universal
Scrambled Negative Control siRNA Duplex from
Origene (Catalog No. SR30004): TAZ siRNA #1:
GACAUGAGAUCCAUCACUAUU; TAZ siRNA #2:
GGACAAACACCCAUGAACAUU; TAZ siRNA #3:
AAGCCUAGCUCGUGGCGGAUU. Briefly, MCF7RUNX2 Tet.OFF cells were grown in the presence
(RUNX2 negative) or absence (RUNX2 positive)
of doxycycline for 3 days and then transfected with
corresponding siRNA using Lipofectamine-2000
(Invitrogen, #1168-019). RIPA extracts were obtained
48 hr post transfection and total protein was analyzed
by Western blot (see above) and probed for TAZ protein
expression. Protein levels were normalized to actin and
quantified using NIH Image-J software.
To assay for sE-Cad levels, MCF7-RUNX2 Tet.
OFF cells were grown in the presence (RUNX2 negative)
or absence (RUNX2 positive) of doxycycline for 3
days and then transfected with TAZ siRNA #1 using
Lipofectamine-2000. Cells were trypsinized, replated
24 hours later, and allowed to reattach. After 72 hours,
nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were obtained using
the High/Low salt extraction method described above
and analyzed for sE-Cad, TAZ, and RUNX2. Protein

TCGA RUNX2 protein analysis
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data were
obtained from the online cbioportal (http://www.
cbioportal.org/public-portal). The results shown represent
protein expression and are based upon data generated
by the TCGA Research Network (http://cancergenome.
nih.gov). Briefly, cellular proteins were extracted and
denatured in SDS sample buffer. After serial dilution of
each sample, cell lysates were arrayed on nitrocellulosecoated slides and probed with specific RUNX2 and HRPcoupled antibodies to detect a signal by DAB colorimetric
reaction. Spot densities were determined by MiroVigene
(automatic spot finding and background subtraction) and
protein concentrations were determined by super curve
fitting and normalized for protein loading.
