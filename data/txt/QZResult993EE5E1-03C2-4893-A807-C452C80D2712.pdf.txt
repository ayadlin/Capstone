ABSTRACT
The efficacy of anti-angiogenic therapies on cancer patients is limited by the
emergence of drug resistance, urging the search for second-generation drugs. In this
study, we screened an academic chemical library (DCM, University of Grenoble-Alpes)
and identified a leader molecule, COB223, that inhibits endothelial cell migration and
proliferation. It inhibits also Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC/2) cell proliferation whereas
it does not affect fibroblast proliferation. The anti-angiogenic activity of COB223
was confirmed using several in vitro and in vivo assays. In a mouse LLC/2 tumor
model, ip administration of doses as low as 4 mg/kg COB223 efficiently reduced
the tumor growth rate. We observed that COB223 inhibits endothelial cell ERK1/2
phosphorylation induced by VEGF, FGF-2 or serum and that it acts downstream of
PKC and upstream of Ras. This molecule represents a novel anti-angiogenic and
anti-tumorigenic agent with an original mechanism of action that deserves further
development as an anti-cancer drug.

These include the neutralizing anti-VEGF antibody
bevacizumab, the soluble binding domain of VEGF
receptors aflibercerpt and several small tyrosine kinase
inhibitors targeting VEGF receptor and other kinases,
including sorafenib, sunitinib, pazopanib and regorafenib.
However, up to now, none of the anti-angiogenic drugs
that were approved on the pharmaceutical market can
irreversibly stop tumor progression and turn back cancer
tumors into their dormant state. The major problems
encountered with anti-angiogenic drugs are that a hardly

INTRODUCTION
It is now well accepted that angiogenesis is a ratelimiting step in tumor progression [1]. Deciphering the
molecular mechanisms of tumor angiogenesis has recently
allowed successful translation into clinical applications.
Novel classes of anticancer drugs that specifically target
tumor endothelial cells have been developed and several
clinical trials have demonstrated their benefits in the
treatment of distinct types of metastatic cancers [2, 3].

conditions, the closure rate was 72 ± 4% in the positive
controls and 27 ± 4.% in the negative controls.

predictable but consistent percentage of patients are or
become resistant to these therapies [2, 4]. There is thus a
strong need to develop second-generation anti-angiogenic
drugs that could be used in second line in resistant patients.
In this work, we screened the recently built-up
library of the Department of Molecular Chemistry from
the University of Grenoble (France) for compounds that
can efficiently interfere with the angiogenic process. Such
phenotypic screens - in which a compound collection
is directly assayed on cells - are extremely effective to
discover drugs with new mechanism of action without any
a priori on their biological target. Indeed, a recent survey
has established that the vast majority of first-in-class drugs
were identified by phenotypic screening [5]. Although
small (1360 molecules), this library presents the advantage
of containing original non-commercial molecules. We
adapted the endothelial cell scratch assay to the 96-well
microplate format, since this assay correlates well with
the in vivo angiogenic response [6]. Using this assay, we
selected a family of polyamine derivatives that potently
inhibit endothelial wound healing. We further assessed their
anti-angiogenic and anti-tumorigenic potencies in several
in vitro and in vivo assays. We also succeeded at identifying
the mechanism of action of the leader molecule that appears
to inhibit the Ras/Raf/ERK pathway upstream of Ras and
downstream of the activated growth factor receptors.

Identification of polyamine derivatives as
inhibitors of endothelial cell migration
Using this assay, we screened the academic library
of the University of Grenoble, which is composed of 1360
original molecules. Setting the threshold of significant
responses at 75% of the maximal inhibition, we identified
80 inhibitory molecules. At this stage, we reasoned that
molecules that would affect the cytoskeleton dynamics or
the adhesion properties of any cell type would be positive
in this assay but would not represent good candidates
for further development. We thus decided to perform a
secondary counterscreen of the first 80 selected compounds
on GFP-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts (3T3-GFP) using the
same scratch assay. We then focused our interest on the
5 molecules that inhibited more strongly HMEC-GFP than
3T3-GFP wound healing. Among the most active molecules
were several polyamine derivatives. We synthesized a series
of 30 analogs and tested them at various concentrations
both on HMEC-GFP and 3T3-GFP cells. The IC50 of these
molecules for wound healing inhibition on both cell types is
presented in Table 1. The most potent compound on HMECGFP was COB223 with an IC50 of 5 μM (Figure 2A, 2B).
COB223 was 5 times less efficient at inhibiting wound
closure of 3T3-GFP cells (Figure 2B). COB227 was also an
interesting compound as, although its IC50 on HMEC-GFP
(18 μM) was larger than that of COB223, its specificity for
endothelial over fibroblastic cells was better (Ratio of IC50s
= 14). The structure-activity relationship analysis indicated
that aliphatic polyamines (ethylenediamine, diaminopropane,
putrescine) or dansyl-cadaverine were inactive on both cell
types. Careful analysis of the efficacy of the series of 30
analogs indicated that inhibition requires the presence of
two hydrophobic substituents linked through amino/amidocontaining chains. Dansyl and naphthalimide aromatic
groups, found in COB223 and COB227 respectively,
appeared very efficient. The presence of the diaminomethyl
group on dansyl is critical for the activity of COB223 as
shown by the lower efficiency of COB235 (IC50 is 8 times
higher than that of COB223). COB223 and COB227 contain
a tert-butyloxycarbonyl function (BOC group) as a second
hydrophobic group. Replacement of BOC by an amino
group decreased the efficiency and the specificity (compare
05-102-L-B09 vs 05-06-L-D03, or COB227 vs COB228).
We also tested the effect of two dansyl groups (05-06-LF11, COB222, COB295). The molecules showed interesting
properties but the lack of water solubility precluded further
development. Replacing the amine-containing linker of
COB223 by a diethylene glycol chain in COB296 did not
modify the activity, thus confirming the major importance of
the dansyl and BOC groups whereas the linking chain may
be of various length and chemical nature.

RESULTS
Setting up the HTS screening assay
In order to adapt the endothelial scratch wounding
assay to the constraints of high throughput screening,
we decided to use an endothelial cell line rather than
primary cultures for the sake of reproducibility. Since
angiogenesis is triggered by capillary endothelial cells, we
selected the HMEC-1 cell line which consists of human
dermal microvascular endothelial cells stably expressing
SV40 middle T antigen [7]. We infected this cell line with
GFP-encoding retroviral particles and selected one clone
(thereafter named HMEC-GFP) that presented a high level
of fluorescence and a strong proliferation rate (doubling
time in the presence of serum: 22 h). We controlled that
GFP expression was stable over at least 50 passages and
that these cells still expressed endothelial markers such
as VE-cadherin and CD31. In a standard assay, HMECGFP cells were grown until confluence in 96-well plates
in the presence of serum, scratched with the multi-tip
dispenser of the HTS automat, gently rinsed twice to
eliminate detached cells and cell debris that could liberate
inflammatory and potentially angiogenic cytokines,
and incubated for 24 h in the presence of serum and the
compounds to be tested. Each well was photographed at
time 0 h (after wounding) and 24 h under a motorized
epifluorescence microscope and the digitized images
were analyzed using Image J to determine the percentage

we also used the Boyden chamber assay. As shown
in Figure 1B, the migration of human microvascular
endothelial cells towards a chemo-attractant (fetal
calf serum) was significantly inhibited by COB223.
These two experiments clearly indicate that endothelial
cell migration, and probably also endothelial cell
proliferation, are inhibited by COB223.

As the screening was performed with GFPexpressing cell lines that might behave differently
from primary endothelial cells, we measured the
dose-dependent effect of COB223 on primary dermal
microvascular endothelial cells (HMVECd) and on 3T3
fibroblasts (Figure 3). COB223 appeared to be less active
on HMVECd (EC50 = 25 μM) than on HMEC-GFP
(EC50 = 5 μM) but its preferential action on endothelial
cells versus fibroblasts was still observed.
As wound healing in the scratch has been shown
to result from activation of both cell migration and
cell proliferation, we repeated this experiment in the
presence of mitomycin C, a potent cell proliferation
inhibitor. As shown in Figure S1A, wound healing was
slowed down in the presence of mitomycin C confirming
the implication of cell proliferation to the healing
process, but COB 223 still inhibited endothelial cell
wound closure in the absence of any cell proliferation.

We then checked the effects of the leader
compound COB223 on cell growth. As shown in Figure
2C and 2D, COB223 inhibited thymidine incorporation
into both HMVECd and HUVEC endothelial cells at
concentrations above 5 μM. We also checked the effects
of COB223 on 3T3 fibroblast and LLC/2 lung carcinoma
cell proliferation (Figure 2E and 2F). Interestingly,
COB223 appeared to have no effect on 3T3 cells (as
already observed on cell migration) but inhibited LLC/2

cell proliferation although less efficiently than it did on
endothelial cells. These effects were confirmed by cell
cycle analysis using a FACS cytometer (data not shown)
and by measuring in vitro growth curves by cell counting
(Figure S2).
In parallel, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of COB223
on these four cell types by incubating confluent cells with
various concentrations of this compound for 24 h at 37°C
(Figure 4). It clearly appeared that COB223 was cytotoxic
on all cell types at concentrations larger than 50 μM. The
major effects observed on endothelial cell proliferation
and migration at 5 to 20 μM are thus not attributable to
any cytotoxic effect.

or the presence of 10 ng/ml FGF-2 and either 10 or
20 μM COB223 and we observed the spontaneous radial
sprouting of endothelial cells after 96 h of culture. As
shown in Figure 5A and 5B, 10 μM COB223 inhibited
both basal and FGF-2-stimulated sprouting by 50% and
70%, respectively.
We then used a second angiogenesis assay in which
embryonic stem (ES) cells are allowed to differentiate
toward the endothelial lineage and to subsequently
sprout from pre-formed spheroids into a collagen-I
gel [8]. Endothelial sprouts can be visualized by CD31
immunostaining of in toto preparations (Figure 6). Adding
COB223 (12.5 μM) to the collagen gel at day 6 clearly
resulted in a complete inhibition of endothelial sprouting
as shown in Figure 6A and 6B.

implanted under the dorsal skin of mice. FGF-2 is then
injected every other day through the skin into the sponge
in the presence or the absence of either COB223 or
vehicle. After 7 days, the blood vessels and capillaries
that have grown from the skin towards the surface of the
sponge can be visualized by non-invasive image analysis
using the fluorescent marker RAFT-(RGDc)4 (also known
as AngiostampTM), as recently established [9]. After
imaging, the sponges can be recovered from sacrificed
mice, photographed and the angiogenic response can be
monitored by determination of the hemoglobin content
of the homogenized sponges. As shown in Figure 7,
both techniques conclusively showed a strong inhibition
of the neovascular response to FGF-2 in the presence of
COB223.

day 7), were treated i.p. every other day either with 4 mg/
kg or 16 mg/kg COB223 or with vehicle. Under COB223
treatment, we observed a similar decrease of tumor growth
(32% to 38% reduction in tumor size at day 18 postimplantation) for both doses comparatively to mice treated
with vehicle (Figure 8A). Although this inhibition is not
drastic, it is interesting to note that the reduction in tumor
size results from decreased growth rate since the slope of
the growth curve is reduced under COB223 treatment.
Hematoxylin/eosin staining of COB223-treated tumor
sections revealed enlarged necrotic areas as compared
to untreated tumors (Figure 8B). Quantification of this
necrotic process indicated that 20% of untreated tumors
versus 60% of COB223-treated tumors presented necrotic
areas larger than 15% of their surface (Figure 8C). In
addition, we investigated tumor vascularization by CD31
immunostaining (Figure 8B). A significant decrease in the
density and the size (luminal surface) of the microvessels
was observed in the non-necrotic part of COB223-treated
tumors, as quantified in Figure 8D and 8E. This allowed us
to speculate that the anti-tumoral effect of COB223 might
be caused, at least in part, by its anti-angiogenic action.
However, as we observed that COB223 reduces also the

HUVEC cells was unaffected by the presence of COB223
whereas it was efficiently displaced by unlabeled VEGF
(data not shown). We then evaluated whether COB223
could act as a protein-kinase inhibitor, although its
structure does not resemble those of ATP-competing
inhibitors such as sorafenib or sunitinib. In vitro kinase
assays were performed with a panel of purified proteinkinases involved in mitogenic signaling, including
VEGFR2, FGFR1, FGFR2, PDGFRß, Met, Raf, MEK1,
ERK1, ERK2, PKCα, PKCβI, PKCβII, PKCζ as indicated
in Table 2. None of them was inhibited by COB223 at
concentrations up to 50 μM. We then analyzed the effect of
COB223 on VEGF-induced phosphorylations of VEGFR2,
MEK and ERK1/2 (Figure 9). COB223 did not alter the
autophosphorylation of VEGFR2 on tyrosine residues
1175 (this site mediates activation of the ERK pathway)
and 1214 (this site mediates the activation of the p38
MAP kinase pathway) [10] (Figure 9A, 9B). In contrast,
VEGF-induced phosphorylations of MEK and ERK1/2
were significantly inhibited in the presence of COB223.
When FGF-2 or fetal calf serum were used as mitogenic
activators of the MAP kinase pathway, we observed a
similar inhibitory effect of COB223 on MEK and ERK1/2
(Figure 9A, 9C). A detailed dose-response study indicated
that inhibition of MAP kinase phosphorylation was
detectable at a concentration of 5 μM and was statistically
significant at 20 μM. This inhibition also appeared to be

proliferation of tumor cells, we analyzed the proliferative
status of control and COB223-treated tumors using two
markers of cell division, phospho-ERK1/2 and phosphohistone H3 (Figure 8B). The number of positive cells for
these two markers was significantly decreased in sections
from COB223-treated tumors (Figure 8F).
As COB227 showed a better ratio of in vitro
activity between endothelial cells and fibroblasts, we also
checked its effects on in vivo LLC/2 tumor growth. We
observed no inhibition of tumor growth and therefore
stopped the development of this series of naphtalimide
compounds, as this lack of effect probably reflected poor
pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic properties.

Identification of COB223 mechanism of action
We first wondered whether COB223 required to
be internalized to exert its biological effect. For this,
we synthesized a covalent complex between BSA and
COB223 and purified it. Whereas COB223 (which can
be visualized by its fluorescent dansyl group) was rapidly
taken up and internalized in endothelial cells (Figure S3),
COB223-BSA did not appear to enter these cells (data not
shown). Interestingly, COB223-BSA was also unable to
inhibit wound closure in endothelial cells, indicating that
its mode of action is intracellular. In agreement with this
conclusion, we observed that binding of 125I-VEGF-A121 to

somehow cell-specific since COB223 did not affect FGF2induced or serum-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in
3T3 fibroblasts (data not shown). It was also specific of the
p42/p44 MAP kinase pathway as activation of p38 MAP
kinase phosphorylation in HUVEC cells by VEGF or
serum was unaffected by COB223 (data not shown). The
activation of src phosphorylation by VEGF in HUVECs
was also unaffected by COB223 (data not shown).
One important step between the phosphorylation of
growth factor receptors and the activation of ERK1/2 is
the activation of Ras. Unlike most other receptor tyrosine
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

kinases, VEGFR2 activates Ras, not via GRB2-SOS,
but  via phospho-Y1175-dependent phosphorylation of
PLCγ and subsequent activation of protein kinases-C
(PKCs) [11, 12]. Although the exact mechanism of
VEGFR2-induced Ras activation is still unclear, one
proposed mechanism involves PKC-mediated activation
of sphingosine kinase-1 (SPK1) [13]. In agreement with
these statements, we observed that chemical inhibitors of
PKC (Gö6976+Gö6983), completely inhibited VEGFinduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation in HUVECs whereas
they only partially inhibited FGF2-induced ERK1/2

were performed with each of these purified protein-kinases in the presence or the absence of various

than 5% in the presence of these concentrations of COB223.

phosphorylation (Figure 10A). In the same assay, COB223
inhibited the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 induced by
the PKC activator PMA (Figure 10B), confirming that
it is acting downstream of PKC. We then checked the
phosphorylation of the upstream activator of MEK,
namely Raf and of the downstream target of activated
VEGFR2, namely PLCγ (Figure 11A). VEGF-induced
tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ on residue Y783 was
unaffected by COB223. In contrast, phosphorylation
of Raf on residue S338 (the target of Ras activation)
was inhibited in the presence of COB223 whereas Raf
phosphorylation on residue S259 (a site reported as a
direct target of PKA and Akt/PKB) was not. The same
differential effect was observed on Raf phosphorylation
when serum was used as a mitogenic stimulus (data not
shown). We then attempted to measure the activation of
Ras by using a pull-down assay in which the Ras-binding
domain of Raf is used to catch and subsequently detect
active Ras but we were unable to generate reproducible
results. In order to circumvent this limitation, we checked
the effect of COB223 on the phosphorylation of ERK1/2
induced by the constitutive expression of oncogenic
RasG12V in MCF-10A cells (Figure 11B). COB223 did
not modify this constitutive phosphorylation, suggesting
that it is acting upstream of Ras. In agreement with this
observation, COB223 did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation
induced by estrogen in CCL-39 fibroblasts expressing a
constitutively active Raf in an estrogen-responsive manner
(Figure 11C).

than the existing ones, are thus urgently required for
second or third line treatments of angiogenic cancers.
In this work, we searched for such new antiangiogenic molecules by screening an academic chemical
library (from DCM, University Grenoble-Alpes, France)
that contained original, never-patented molecules. We
could identify a family of dansylated polyamines which
showed marked cell specificity as they inhibited more
strongly endothelial cell than 3T3 fibroblast migration
and proliferation. The SAR study revealed that natural
or synthetic aliphatic polyamines such as spermine,
putrescine, diaminopropane or ethylenediamine were
inactive and that both chemical goups (dansyl and
BOC) present at each extremity of the leader compound
COB223 were important. So far, no biological activity for
such compounds (or closely structural analogs) has been
described.
We wondered whether COB223 required to be
internalized to exert its anti-angiogenic action. The
fluorescent molecule COB223 is rapidly internalized by
endothelial cells in a temperature-dependent manner.
Interestingly, uptake of COB223 was less efficient in 3T3
fibroblasts (Figure S3) and appeared to correlate with
the lesser biological activity of this compound on 3T3
cell proliferation and migration. In agreement with an
intracellular site of action of COB223, we observed that
coupling COB223 to BSA (BSA is not cell-permeable)
suppressed its inhibitory effect on endothelial cell
migration. In addition, we observed no competition
of COB223 with VEGF-A for its cell surface receptors
and no inhibition of VEGF-induced VEGFR2 tyrosine
phosphorylation. Taken together, these observations
support an intracellular mode of action for this molecule.
Careful and detailed analysis of the effects of
COB223 on the signaling pathway activated in endothelial
cells by VEGF and other endothelial mitogens such
as FGF-2 and serum, led us to the conclusions that
COB223 acts downstream of the activated growth factor
receptors and upstream of activated Ras, Raf, MEK and
ERK1/2 (Figure 12). Ras is a small G-protein acting
downstream of growth factor receptors. In quiescent
cells, Ras is bound to GDP and is inactive. Unlike most
growth factors which activate Ras through the adaptor
proteins Grb2 and the GDP/GTP exchange factor Sos,
VEGF induces the recruitment of the adaptor protein
TSAd (T cell-specific adaptor) and the effector protein

DISCUSSION
Anti-angiogenic drugs such as anti-VEGF antibodies
(Bevacizumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (Sorafenib,
Sunitinib, Pazopanib, …) have proven some efficacy in
the treatment of several metastatic cancers [14, 15]. Since
their beneficial effect is only observed in association
with chemotherapy, their true mechanism of action in the
patients is still a matter of debate [16–18]. Moreover, the
frequent appearance of resistance to these anti-angiogenic
therapies have tempered the initial enthusiasm [19]. When
resistance to a first line anti-angiogenic treatment emerges,
changing the class of anti-angiogenic molecules (e.g.
from Bevacizumab to a tyrosine kinase inhibitor) results
in prolonged survival of the patients [20]. New antiangiogenic molecules, acting through distinct mechanisms

PLCγ onto the phosphorylated residues Y951 and
Y1175 of activated VEGFR2, respectively [12, 21].
Subsequent phosphorylation of PLCγ induces hydrolysis
of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol
(4,5)-bisphosphate into diacylglycerol and inositol
1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which, in turn, activate the
PKC isoforms PKCα, PKCβ and PKC ζ [22, 23]. One
relevant substrate of VEGF-activated PKCs is sphingosine
kinase 1 (SPK1), which converts sphingosine into
sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P). How S1P activates Ras is
still an unanswered question but it was reported that this
occurred through activation of GAPs (GTPase activating
proteins) rather than through inhibition of GEFs (Guanine
exchange factors) [13]. In its GTP-bound form, Ras
recruits the protein kinase Raf at the plasma membrane
and subsequently activates MEK and ERK1/2 (p42/p44
MAPK). As we observed that COB223 inhibits not only
endothelial cell migration but also cell proliferation, the
inhibition of Ras activation would certainly be decisive
for triggering cell proliferation arrest. It was more
surprising to us that COB223 did not affect the activation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of p38 MAPK as this pathway, which is also stimulated by
activated VEGF receptors, has been reported to trigger cell
migration through phosphorylation of heat-shock protein
27 [24] and LIM kinase 1 [25]. One possible explanation is
that other signaling pathways implicated in cell migration
such as Rho-A or Focal Adhesion Kinase (FAK) are
affected downstream of Ras inhibition [26]. More detailed
studies will be required to elucidate these mechanisms.
Intraperitoneal administration of COB223 to LLC/2
tumor-bearing mice resulted in a significant decrease the
rate of tumor growth, suggesting a direct anti-proliferative
or pro-apoptotic effect. No difference was observed
between the two doses tested, indicating that 4 mg/
kg already produced a maximal effect. This is a much
lower dose than those routinely used with other chemical
angiogenesis inhibitors in similar models: 30–60  mg/
kg for sorafenib or 50 mg/kg for sunitinib. Although
the compound is not yet optimized, this suggests that its
bioavailability is excellent. The intensity of fluorescence
of the dansyl group of COB223 was unfortunately not
sufficient to allow a detailed study of the biodistribution

cytostatic for LLC/2 tumor cells in vitro, the observed
antitumoral effects might result from both an antiangiogenic effect and a direct anti-proliferative effect on
tumor cells. COB223 appears to inhibit the growth factorinduced Raf/MEK/ERK protein kinase cascade but to
be unable to inhibit the activation of these kinases by an
oncogenic version of Ras. It should therefore be efficient

noting that, in Lewis lung carcinoma, Ras is not mutated
but is activated due to lack of p66Shc expression [27].
Several targeted therapies that inhibit the RasRaf-MEK-ERK pathway have been developed by
pharmaceutical companies. The clinical performance of
Ras farnesylation inhibitors has remained disappointing
[28]. Several kinase inhibitors targeting this pathway are
also undergoing clinical trials. In this context, COB223
appears as a promising leader compound targeting the Ras
pathway by a novel mechanism.

General procedure A
Stoichiometric amount (0.65 mmol) of the acyl
chloride and the alkylamine (RNH2) were mixed together
in dichloromethane (3 ml) and the resulting solution
was stirred for 15 h at room temperature. Aqueous
sodium carbonate solution (1M, 3 ml) was added and the
resulting mixture was vigorously stirred for 1 h and then
let on standing to allow clean separation of the two layers.
The organic layer was decanted, washed several
times with water, and finally with brine. The organic layer
was dried on MgSO4, filtered and evaporated to dryness
under reduced pressure. Most of the newly synthesised
molecules were isolated as oily residues.
The purity of the new compounds was checked by
analytical hplc, and the structures confirmed by NMR
analysis.
This procedure was performed with carboxylic
acid chloride (benzoyl chloride), sulfonic acid chlorides
(tosyl-, naphthalene sulfonyl and dansyl chlorides) or
chloroformates. (para-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl chloride).

MATERIALS & METHODS
Cell culture, small molecules and reagents
HMEC-1, HMEC-GFP, NIH-3T3, and 3T3-GFP
were maintained in DMEM 1g/L glucose (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS). Human
dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-d)
and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)
(Lonza) were maintained in endothelial growth medium
(EGM-2-MV, Cambrex) supplemented with 5% FCS and
additives recommended by the manufacturer. LLC/2 tumor
cells were grown in DMEM 4.5g/L glucose (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (FCS). CJ7
embryonic stem cells were cultured on 1% gelatincoated dishes in Iscove’s medium containing Glutamax
(Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium; Invitrogen) and
supplemented with 15% FCS, 1% non-essential aminoacids, 1% ATAM, 150 μM monothioglycerol and 1000 U/
mL of leukemia inhibitory factor (Chemicon). MCF-10A
cells stably overexpressing oncogenic RasG12V were kindly
provided to us by Dr O. Filhol (BCI lab, Grenoble, France).
CCL-39 fibroblasts expressing a constitutively active Raf
in an estrogen-responsive manner [29] were a generous
gift from Dr G. Pagès (IRCAN, Nice, France). Unless
otherwise indicated, antibodies were purchased from Cell
Signaling, except for anti-phospho-MAPK (Promega), antiMAPK (Sigma) and anti-c-Raf (BD Biosciences).

General procedure B
A mixture of the amine (1.5 eq.) and naphthalic
anhydride (1 eq.) in EtOH was refluxed for 24 h. The solvent
was then evaporated and the residue was dissolved in the
minimum amount of AcOEt. A large volume of Et2O was
added and the resulting solid was filtered off. The organic
phase was evaporated to dryness to give the desired product.
General procedure C (Boc deprotection)
The Boc protected amines were dissolved in EtOH
(2 ml) and 37% HCl (2 ml) was slowly added to the
solution cooled in an ice-bath. The solution was then kept
for 1 h at rt and the solid that had formed was filtered
off. To obtain the free base, the solid was dissolved in the
minimum amount of water and the solution was basified
by slowly adding a saturated solution of NaHCO3 until
reaching pH 11. The aqueous solution was then extracted
three times with CH2Cl2. The organic layer was washed
with water and brine, dried over MgSO4 and evaporated.

overnight at rt. The solvent was then evaporated to dryness
and the residue was solubilized in a mixture of 2N HCl and
CH2CL2. The organic phase was removed and the aqueous
phase was basified to allow precipitation of COB222. The

Preparation of green fluorescent cell lines

The mono-dansyl polyamine 2 (303 mg, 0.65
mmol), prepared as described above for COB223,
(303 mg, 0.65 mmol) was solubilized in CH2Cl2 (20 ml)
and slowly added to a solution of triethylene glycol
bischloroformate 3 (1.3 ml, 6.5 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (200 ml)
cooled to 0°C. The solution was stirred at rt for 30 min.
Aminoacetaldehyde dimethyl acetal (1.4 ml, 13 mmol)
and NEt3 (1.8 ml, 13 mmol) were then added and to
the resulting mixture was stirred overnight at room
temperature. The reaction was followed by TLC (silica
gel, elution: MeOH) Diluted citric acid aqueous solution
was then added to the organic solution. The water phase
was separated, basified to pH 10  and extracted with
CH2Cl2. The organic phase was washed with water and
brine, dried over MgSO4 and evaporated. The fluorescent
yellow oil (345 mg) thus obtained was analyzed by NMR
and used in the BSA conjugation step without any further
purification.

The COB-acetal 5 (300 mg, 0.40 mmol) was
diluted in aqueous 0.01M HCl (6 ml) and the pH value
was adjusted to 2 by adding 1N HCl. The reaction was
carried out at 20°C. The presence of the free aldehyde
was checked by mixing a small aliquot of the reaction
mixture to a 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine aqueous solution
(20 mg in 5 mL). The formation of the corresponding
2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazone was evidenced as a new spot
on the TLC (elution: MeOH).
An aliquot of the reaction mixture (300 μl, 0.08
mmol) was mixed with BSA (20 mg, 3.10-7 mol) in 2 ml
of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) at room temperature.
Every 2h, 50 ml of a freshly prepared NaBH3CN aqueous
solution consisting of 10 mg (0.26 mmol) dissolved in
360 ml of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7) was added to
the vial. After the third addition, the solution was kept
overnight at 4°C. The solution was then chromatographed
through Sephadex G25 column eluted with neat water. The
presence of dansyl in the fractions corresponding to the
protein was checked by fluorescence (UV illumination at
365 nm) and aliquots of 10 ml were mixed with 10 ml
of loading buffer (100 mM Tris-Cl, 4%SDS, 0.2%
bromophenol blue, 20% glycerol, 200 mM dithiothreitol),
denatured by heating at 90°C for 10 min and then
analyzed by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.
The fluorescent staining of the bands corresponding to
BSA confirmed the covalent bonding of COB derivative.
Fractions containing exclusively the BSA-COB conjugate
were pooled and filtered through 0.22 mm filter affording
4 μmol of BSA-COB conjugate (based on dansyl
absorbance, ε = 4200 at 334 nm).

HMEC-1 or NIH-3T3 cells were infected by
a defective retrovirus coding for the enhanced green
fluorescent protein (EGFP). A construct containing EGFP
under the control of herpetic human cytomegalovirus
(HCMV) promoter, and neo gene (vector pEGFP-N1,
Clontech, St Germain-en-Laye, France), was subcloned
in the pLNCX vector. This construct was introduced in
PT67 cells by transfection with Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). The supernatant of PT67 cells was filtrated to
collect viral particles, in order to infect HMEC-1 and 3T3
cells. Neomycin-resistant clones expressing EGFP were
isolated by limit dilution and amplified as independent cell
lines. These cell lines stably expressing EGFP were named
HMEC-GFP and 3T3-GFP.

Quality control of the screening assay
The screening of the chemical library was
performed on HMEC-GFP cell monolayers grown in 96well plates by measuring the rate of closure of a linear
wound made automatically in each well by pipette tips.
To evaluate the quality of the assay, the Z’ factor was
calculated using the following equation according to
Zhang et al. [35]:

where c+ are the bioactive controls (0.5% serum), c– the
negative controls (10% serum), μ the mean of 48 repeats,
and σ the standard deviation. Under our conditions, we
calculated a Z’ factor of 0.59. For cell-based assays, Z’
factors greater than 0.4 are deemed acceptable. Thus,
this test was compatible with high-throughput screening
requirements.

Scratch assay
Confluent cell monolayers were wounded with a
plastic pipet tip, washed gently with phosphate buffer
saline (PBS) and treated with complete media containing
molecules, as indicated. Cells were placed at 37°C into
the incubator and photographed at indicated times.
Quantitation of closure of the monolayer was performed
using the NIH Image J program (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/).
Results are expressed as percentage of wound closure at
t = 24 h as compared to the initial wound at t = 0 h.

Cell migration assay using Boyden chambers
The assay was performed using 24-multiwell
plates and individual cell culture inserts bearing a porous
(size of pores: 3 μm) and dyed bottom membrane, which
were purchased from BD (FluoroBlokTM). HUVEC cells
were rendered fluorescent by incubation for 24 h in the

seeded (5 x 104 cells/insert) in the upper chambers (inserts)
in serum-free culture medium supplemented with 25 μM
COB223 or with vehicle (DMSO). Serum supplemented
medium (5% FCS) was placed in the lower chambers
(plate wells). After incubation for 4 h or 24 h at 37°C, the
fluorescence of cells that had passed through the dyed
membrane was measured on a plate reader at 540 nm/570
nm excitation/emission wavelengths.

(10 or 20 μM) or FGF-2 (10 ng/mL) were added in the
preparation before collagen gelification.

Embryonic stem cells (ESC) differentiation into
endothelial lineage
CJ7 cells (1000 cells/well; 12-well plates) were
allowed to differentiate in collagen gels in Iscove’s
medium containing Glutamax (Iscove’s modified
Dulbecco’s medium; Invitrogen) supplemented with
1.2  mg/mL collagen I (BD Biosciences, Bedford,
MA), 15% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), 450 μM
monothioglycerol (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/mL insulin
(Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland), 50 U/mL
penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen), as
previously described [36]. A cocktail of growth factors
was also added containing 50 ng/mL human VEGF-A
(AbCys) and 100 ng/mL human FGF-2 (a generous gift
from Dr. A. Baird, Whittier Institute, La Jolla, CA). At
day 6, molecules were added with a novel addition of
50 ng/mL human VEGF-A and 100 ng/mL human FGF-2.
Differentiation was allowed during 11 days.

Cell proliferation
Cells were treated with molecules in complete
medium. After 22 h, 1 μCi per well H3 thymidine
was added for 2 hours. Cells are then fixed by 10%
trichloroacetic acid and harvested with 0.2N NaOH, 1%
SDS. Radioactivity was measured in a beta counter.

Cell viability
Once they had reached confluency, cells were
kept for 24 hours in medium supplemented with 0.5%
FCS (LLC/2 and 3T3 cells) or 2.5% FCS (HUVEC
and HMVEC-d cells), in the presence of COB223 at
different concentrations. WST-1 assay (Roche Diagnostic,
Meylan, France) was then performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunocytochemistry of embryoid bodies (EBs)
Collagen gels containing EBs were dehydrated
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde during 15 min at
room temperature. EBs were incubated for 1 h with
a rat monoclonal anti-mouse platelet/endothelial cell
adhesion molecule (PECAM)/CD31 antibody (clone
MEC-13.3, a gift from Dr A. Vecchi, Milano, Italy)
as previously described [37], followed by a 40 min
incubation with a cyanine-3-labeled donkey anti-rat Ig
antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, West
Grove, PA). EBs were then mounted before examination
under an epifluorescence microscope. For quantitation of
endothelial sprouting, images were captured with a digital
camera and measurement of the total length of endothelial
sprouts was achieved by morphometric analysis using
ImageJ software.

Sprouting of HMEC-GFP
To prepare spheroids, HMEC-GFP cells were
seeded at 3000 cells/well in round-bottom 96-multiwell
plates in DMEM 1 g/L glucose (Eurobio, Les Ulis,
France) containing 0.25% methylcellulose. 48 h later, the
spheroids were collected, transferred into flat-bottom 96well plates and embedded in collagen gel (1.2 mg/mL type
I collagen) prepared in a Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium, supplemented with FGF-2 (10 ng/mL), 50 U/
mL penicillin and 50 μg/mL streptomycin. Treatment
with COB223 (10 and 20 μM) started right after spheroids
were included in the collagen gels. Sprouting was allowed
for 24 h at 37°C. Images were acquired by fluorescence
microscopy and analysis of gel invasion was performed
using the freeware Image J. Statistical analysis was
performed using a Kruskal & Wallis test.

Ethics statement
Mice were housed under conventional conditions in
the animal care facility at the Commissariat à l’Energie
Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives. All experimental
procedures were conducted according to the institutional
guidelines and those formulated by the European
Community for the Use of Experimental Animals. The
animal protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of the Commissariat à l’Energie
Atomique.

Invasion of HMEC-GFP spheroids in collagen
matrix
HMEC-GFP cells were developed as spheroids
in an Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s medium containing
0.2% methylcellulose in round-bottom 96-multiwell
plate. Two days later, spheroids were collected and
invasion was allowed in a Iscove’s modified Dulbecco’s
medium, supplemented with 1.2 mg/mL collagen I,
50 U/mL Penicillin, 50 μg/mL streptomycin. Molecules

implanted under the skin of Balb-c mice under general
anesthesia. Mice were divided in three groups receiving
either DMSO, FGF-2, or FGF-2 and COB223 (groups
of respectively 6, 7 and 8 mice). The sponges were
hydrated with 50 μl of PBS and 1.25% DMSO (vehicle
of COB223), or FGF-2 (200 ng) or a mixture of FGF-2
(200 ng) and COB223 (100 μM). DMSO, FGF-2 and/or
COB223 (50 μL) were injected again into the sponges
through the skin on day 1 and 2. A third injection of
COB223 alone was performed on day 4. On day 7, the
vascularization of the sponges was imaged by noninvasive fluorescence imaging after i.p. injection of RAFT(cRGD)4 (AngiostampTM, Fluoptics, Grenoble, France)
as described in [9]. The mice were then anesthetized and
sacrificed by cervical dislocation on day 7 and the sponges
were rapidly excised and photographed. Each sponge was
then homogenized in 1 mL RIPA lysis buffer and the
supernatants were used for quantification. The extent of
vascularization of the sponge implants was assessed by
measuring the amount of hemoglobin using the Drabkin’s
reagent (Sigma).

Western blotting
Serum-starved HUVEC cells were incubated for 15
min in the presence of either 10 ng/mL VEGF-A or 20 ng/
mL FGF-2 and in the absence or the presence of indicated
concentration of COB223. COB223 was incubated 15
min prior to stimulation. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer
( Tris HCl pH 7.4 10 mM, NaCl 150 mM, SDS 0.1%, Na
Deoxycholate 0.5%, EDTA 1 mM, Triton X100 1% and
protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma) for protein extraction.
After fractionation of proteins on a 4–15% SDS-PAGE gel
and blotting to a nitrocellulose membrane, immunoblotting
detection of proteins was done using indicated antibodies
according to manufacturer’s instruction.

We chose this model because of its rapid growth in
syngenic mice and its strong dependence on angiogenesis.
LLC/2 cells (106 in 50 μL medium) were subcutaneously
injected into the right flank of nude mice. Seven days after
tumor inoculation, mice were given an intraperitoneal
(i.p.) injection of either solvent (1.7% DMSO) or COB223
every other day. Tumor size was measured with calipers,
and the volume was calculated according to the formula
(L*w2)/2 where L and h stand for length and width
respectively. All mice were killed 21 days after tumor
grafting.

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors collected after animal sacrifice were split
into two parts and fixed either in 4% paraformaldehyde
(v/v) or in formalin fixative for 24 h at 4°C and embedded
in paraffin and then cut into 7 μm sections. Sections
were stained using specific antibodies and the avidin–
biotin immunoperoxidase detection method. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched by pretreatment with
3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 min.
For endothelial immunohistochemistry detection, CD31
antibody (MEC13.3, BD Pharmingen) was incubated
for 2 h at room temperature. The tissue sections were
subsequently washed three times with PBS and incubated
with biotinylated rabbit anti-rat IgG (1:250 dilution
in blocking solution; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin
Fallavier, France) for 1 h at room temperature. After
three PBS washes, the slides were incubated with an
avidin: biotin complex (Vectastain ABC kit; Vector
