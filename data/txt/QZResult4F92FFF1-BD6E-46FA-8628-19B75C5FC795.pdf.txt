Abstract
Elevation of the DNA-unwinding helicase RECQL4, which
participates in various DNA repair pathways, has been suggested
to contribute to the pathogenicity of various human cancers,
including gastric cancer. In this study, we addressed the prognostic
and chemotherapeutic signiﬁcance of RECQL4 in human gastric
cancer, which has yet to be determined. We observed signiﬁcant
increases in RECQL4 mRNA or protein in >70% of three independent sets of human gastric cancer specimens examined, relative to normal gastric tissues. Strikingly, high RECQL4 expression
in primary tumors correlated well with poor survival and gastric
cancer lines with high RECQL4 expression displayed increased
resistance to cisplatin treatment. Mechanistic investigations
revealed a novel role for RECQL4 in transcriptional regulation

Introduction
Systemic chemotherapy is the main treatment option for gastric
cancer patients as gastric cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced
stage and surgical removal is not feasible. However, prognosis and
clinical response are highly variable even for the same grade and

of the multidrug resistance gene MDR1, through a physical
interaction with the transcription factor YB1. Notably, ectopic
expression of RECQL4 in cisplatin-sensitive gastric cancer cells
with low endogenous RECQL4 was sufﬁcient to render them
resistant to cisplatin, in a manner associated with YB1 elevation
and MDR1 activation. Conversely, RECQL4 silencing in cisplatinresistant gastric cancer cells with high endogenous RECQL4
suppressed YB1 phosphorylation, reduced MDR1 expression, and
resensitized cells to cisplatin. In establishing RECQL4 as a critical
mediator of cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells, our ﬁndings
provide a therapeutic rationale to target RECQL4 or the downstream AKT–YB1–MDR1 axis to improve gastric cancer treatment.

stage of the tumors and chemoresistance chieﬂy contributes to
treatment failure and recurrence in gastric cancer patients (1).
Therefore, understanding the molecular/mechanistic basis for the
chemoresistance in gastric cancer is essential not only for devising
a better treatment modality but also for developing new chemosensitization strategies to improve gastric cancer patient survival
in the future.
Cisplatin (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) is one of the
most frequently used chemotherapeutic drugs in clinical gastric
cancer treatment settings. The most prominent mode of its
action is to initiate an intrinsic apoptotic pathway through
DNA damage response activation (2). Many gastric cancer
patients display cisplatin resistance through multiple mechanism(s) including a decreased uptake and/or an increased efﬂux
of cisplatin mediated by speciﬁc transporters, such as MDRs and
ATP7B (3–5). Also, constitutive activation of DNA damage
response (DDR) pathways owing to elevated expression of
DNA repair genes also contributes to chemoresistance by efﬁcient reversal of cisplatin–DNA adducts (6).
RECQL4, a member of RECQ helicase family with DNAunwinding activity (7), plays an important role in maintaining
the stability of nuclear (8) and mitochondrial genomes (9–11).
This is well supported by the existence of three human autosomal recessive disorders Rothmund–Thomson syndrome (RTS;
ref. 12), RAPADILLINO (13), and Baller–Gerold syndrome
(BGS), all of them owing to mutations in RECQL4 (14).
Mutational loss of RECQL4 is associated with increased risk
for osteosarcoma development in RTS patients (15). In addition, primary ﬁbroblasts from RTS patients have an increased

sensitivity to genotoxic agents (16). RECQL4 had recently been
found to be signiﬁcantly associated with clinical outcome and
RECQL4 suppression sensitized the breast cancer cells to DNAdamaging agents (17, 18).
Although aberrant expression of RECQL4 has been reported in
sporadic osteoblastoma (19), breast and prostate cancer cells and
tissues (20, 21), its prognostic and chemotherapeutic signiﬁcance
in gastric cancer are not known. In this study, we demonstrated
RECQL4 expression is aberrantly elevated frequently in both
clinical gastric cancer samples and tumor cell lines, and a higher
RECQL4 expression renders the gastric cancer cells more resistance
to cisplatin treatment. We further established a molecular link
between RECQL4 expression and cisplatin resistance, in which
RECQL4 potentiates YB1 phosphorylation through enhancing
AKT and YB1 interaction, suggesting that RECQL4 is a critical
determinant of cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells through
regulation of AKT–YB1–MDR1 pathway.

MTT assay and cisplatin treatment
Cell survival was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5- diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Cells were
seeded at a density of 5,000 cells per well in 96-well plates and
incubated at 37 C in humidiﬁed 5% CO2 for 12 hours. Cells
were then exposed to different concentrations of cisplatin for
72 hours, and cellular viability was quantiﬁed by the MTT assay
following the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Probes).
Absorbance values at 540 nm were read on a Spectra Max 250
spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). All MTT assays
include 10 duplicated wells for each time-point of each cell
line. The data represent mean  SD from three independent
experiments.
Dual luciferase assay
A 256-bp length of MDR1 gene promoter region (188 to þ68)
containing Y-box consensus sequence used for luciferase reporter
assay was ampliﬁed by PCR using the following primer pair:
forward: 50 -ggggtaccGCAACGGAAGCCAGAACATT-30 ; reverse: 50 cccaagcttTGGAAAGACCTAAAGGAAACGA-30 . The PCR fragment
was then cloned into the KpnI/HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic vector,
and veriﬁed by sequencing. The pGL3-MDR1pro plasmid was
transiently transfected into YB1-silenced MGC803/Tet-on/FlagRECQL4 cells with YB1 reconstitution and/or doxycyclineinduced expression of RECQL4. Luciferase activity was measured
following the Dual-Luciferase Assay protocol (Promega).
Adenovirus vector–mediated knockdown of RECQL4 and YB1

RECQL4 Modulates MDR1 Expression and Chemoresistance

Results
RECQL4 expression is upregulated in human gastric cancer
samples
To verify whether RECQL4 expression is aberrantly elevated in
human gastric cancer cells, RECQL4 mRNA level was ﬁrst determined by real-time quantitative PCR using TissueScan Human
gastroesophageal cancer tissue qPCR array (Origene). This array
contains cDNA samples of 3 normal gastric tissues ( marked), and
20 gastric cancer samples ( marked) with different pathologic
grades. Other specimens include 3 normal esophageal and 20
esophageal tumor tissues (unmarked). As shown in Fig. 1A, 75%
(15 of 20) of gastric cancer tissues displayed a 2.5-fold higher level
of RECQL4 mRNA than normal tissues. RECQL4 protein level was
next examined by Western blotting in 11 pairs of human gastric
cancer samples and matched normal controls. In corroboration
with elevated RECQL4 mRNA expression in the clinical gastric
cancer samples, RECQL4 protein elevation was also observed in 8
of 11 gastric cancer samples (Fig. 1B).
High cytoplasmic RECQL4 expression correlates with poor
survival of gastric cancer patients
In this study, 92 of 148 tumor cores were found suitable
for analysis as some cores within the TMA were missing or

lacked tumor and these were eliminated from analysis. Low
levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic RECQL4 expression were
found in 18 of 92 (19.6%) samples, whereas 29 of 92 (31.5%)
samples showed high nuclear and low cytoplasmic expression. Furthermore, low nuclear/high cytoplasmic RECQL4
expression was observed in 22 of 92 (23.9%) samples and
high nuclear/high cytoplasmic RECQL4 was found in 23 of
92 (25%) samples (Fig. 1C). As shown in Supplementary
Table S2, compared to tumors with low RECQL4 protein
expression, RECQL4 high nuclear or high nuclear/cytoplasmic
coexpression correlated well with grade III tumors (P ¼
0.048), tumor vascular invasion (P ¼ 0.001), and circumferential resection margin (P ¼ 0.041), suggesting that RECQL4
high expression has a potential role during gastric cancer
tumor progression. Interestingly, tumors with high cytoplasmic RECQL4 expression had poor disease-speciﬁc survival
(P ¼ 0.05). Although RECQL4 nuclear expression alone did
not inﬂuence survival (P ¼ 0.547), tumors with both high
nuclear/cytoplasmic RECQL4 appeared to have poor survival
compared to tumors with low nuclear/cytoplasmic RECQL4
expression (P ¼ 0.05; Fig. 1D). It is to be mentioned that these
patients received only surgery but not any adjuvant/neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

RECQL4 gene is wild type in both gastric cancer cells and
clinical gastric cancer specimens with high RECQL4
expression
To clarify whether the oncogenic property is driven by gain-offunction owing to mutations in RECQL4, the status of RECQL4
gene was analyzed in 7 gastric cancer cell lines and 11 human
surgical gastric cancer specimens by PCR-based single-strand
conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. The primer
sets for 21 exons of RECQL4 coding region and sizes of PCR
products were summarized in Supplementary Table S3. As shown
in Supplementary Figs. S1–S3, abnormal SSCP band migration in
comparison with normal control was observed only in exons 2 to
3 of RECQL4 gene in AGS and HGC-27 tumor cells. Further
sequencing results demonstrated a synonymous GAG to GAA
mutation (Glu-Glu at aa 44) in both cell types. In support, genetic
polymorphism at this locus has been reported previously by
others (12, 25). These results clearly demonstrated that RECQL4
is wild type in both gastric cancer cells and surgical gastric cancer
specimens.
Elevated RECQL4 expression renders the gastric cancer cells
more resistant to cisplatin treatment
We wished to verify whether elevated RECQL4 expression
confers cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer cells. For this purpose,
we ﬁrst examined the RECQL4 protein level in 7 gastric cancer cell
lines in relative to normal gastric epithelium. In corroboration
with elevated RECQL4 mRNA expression in the clinical gastric
cancer samples, RECQL4 protein level was also elevated in all the
gastric cancer cell lines with a much higher level in 4 of the 7 cell
lines including AGS, NCI-N87, HGC-27, and SNU-16 when

RECQL4 physically interacts with YB1. A, endogenous YB1 and AKT were
detected in anti-Flag immunoprecipitates against Flag-RECQL4. Flag-GFP
immunoprecipitates were used as negative controls. B, endogenous RECQL4
and AKT were detected in anti-YB1 (Cell Signaling Technology)
immunoprecipitates determined by Western blotting analysis. C and D,
direct interaction between RECQL4 and YB1 (C), and indirect interaction
between RECQL4 and AKT (D) were demonstrated by in vitro pull-down
assay. E, an enhanced interaction between AKT and YB1 was observed upon
an increased input of RECQL4 protein (antibody from Cell Signaling
Technology). The pull-down YB1 protein was quantiﬁed using the ImageJ
software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and normalized to AKT loading control.

compared with normal control (Fig. 2A). Then the sensitivity to
cisplatin treatment was tested by seeding the gastric cancer cells at
a density of 5,000 cells and treated with graded concentrations of
cisplatin (0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 mg/mL). Cell viability was
quantiﬁed by the MTT assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, NCI-N87, AGS,
and SNU-16 cells with high RECQL4 expression displayed a
signiﬁcantly higher resistance to cisplatin treatment. In contrast,
a much lower cisplatin resistance was observed in MGC-803 cells
with a relatively lower RECQL4 expression. Three cell lines with
high (HGC-27) and low (MKN45, SNU-1) RECQL4 expression
showed an intermediate response to cisplatin. Taken together, our
results showed a reasonably good correlation between RECQL4
expression and cisplatin resistance for most of the gastric cancer
cell lines examined.
RECQL4 physically interacts with YB1
Correlation observed between RECQL4 expression and cisplatin resistance prompted us to examine the downstream
signaling pathway(s) that may be regulated by RECQL4. Immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry was performed

RECQL4 Modulates MDR1 Expression and Chemoresistance

using the lysates of Flag-RECQL4–transfected HEK293 cells.
Among the list of candidates identiﬁed to interact with RECQL4,
YB1 was chosen because YB1 had the highest score in mass
spectrometry analysis. Furthermore, YB1 was demonstrated to
be not only a transcription factor but also involved in multidrug
resistance through regulation of downstream genes such as
MDR1 and major vault protein (MVP) genes (26, 27). Interaction between RECQL4 and YB1 was then tested in Flag-RECQL4
overexpressed U2OS cells by coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP)
assay. Endogenous YB1 was detected in anti-Flag pull-down
lysate with anti-YB1 antibody by Western blotting (Fig. 3A).
Likewise, endogenous RECQL4 was observed in anti-YB1 pulldown complex (Fig. 3B), illustrating the interaction between
RECQL4 and YB1. YB1 has been shown to be downstream
substrate for AKT (28). In support, AKT was detected in the
immunoprecipitated complex using either anti-Flag to FlagRECQL4 or anti-YB1 antibodies (Fig. 3A and B), suggesting
that RECQL4 physically interacts with YB1 and AKT.
To further conﬁrm the nature of interaction, puriﬁed GSTAKT, His-YB1, and His-RECQL4-Flag proteins expressed in
Escherichia coli BL21 and detected by Coomassie brilliant blue
staining (Supplementary Fig. S4) were used for the in vitro pulldown assays. Puriﬁed His-RECQL4-Flag protein was immobilized on Flag beads and then incubated with His-YB1. Puriﬁed
GST-AKT was immobilized on glutathione Sepharose beads,
and incubated with His-YB1 and/or His-RECQL4-Flag protein.
Consistent with the IP results, His-YB1 was pulled down with
His-RECQL4-Flag (Fig. 3C), and also with GST-AKT not by GST
alone (Fig. 3D), suggesting a direct interaction between
RECQL4 and YB1 as well as AKT and YB1. His-RECQL4-Flag
can only be pulled down by GST-AKT in the presence of YB1
(Fig. 3D), suggesting an YB1-dependent interaction between
RECQL4 and AKT. Through mapping the domain of YB1
protein speciﬁcally interacting with RECQL4 using various
GFP-YB1 mutants, the fragment 130–205 aa of YB1 was demonstrated to be responsible for the interaction with RECQL4
(Supplementary Fig. S5).

AKT and YB1 association was enhanced in the presence of
RECQL4
Observation of physical interaction between RECQL4 and YB1
prompted us to examine whether RECQL4 promotes the association of YB1 with AKT. In vitro pull-down assay (Fig. 3E) revealed
that AKT and YB1 interaction was markedly increased by 2.3- to
5.7-fold when RECQL4 protein input was increased from 0 to 0.2
mg (þ) and 1 mg (þþ), respectively. In addition, YB1 and AKT
interaction was detected mainly in the cytoplasmic fraction, and
their interaction in the cytoplasmic fraction was substantially
enhanced when RECQL4 was induced in MGC-803/Tet-on/
Flag-RECQL4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6).
RECQL4 promotes AKT-dependent YB1 phosphorylation
It has been reported previously that YB1, being one of the
substrates for AKT, enters into nuclear compartment and binds to
the promoter region of targeted genes when phosphorylated by
AKT (29). Our ﬁndings of enhanced association of YB1 and AKT
by RECQL4 led us to investigate whether RECQL4 regulates the
level of YB1 phosphorylation in gastric cancer cells or not. AGS
cells with high RECQL4 expression and RECQL4-inducible MGC803 cells with low RECQL4 expression were used for evaluating
the role of RECQL4 in AKT-mediated YB1 phosphorylation.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining results showed that p-YB1 in nuclear
was substantially enhanced in RECQL4-induced MGC-803/Teton cells (Fig. 4A), whereas it was signiﬁcantly decreased in
RECQL4-suppressed AGS cells (Fig. 4B), suggesting that
RECQL4 regulates YB1 phosphorylation and its subsequent
recruitment into the nuclear compartment. Consistently, Western blotting analysis showed an increased p-YB1 level in
RECQL4-induced MGC-803/Tet-on cells (Fig. 4A). Likewise,
RECQL4 suppression in AGS cells resulted in a reduction in
YB1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). However, AKT phosphorylation
was unaffected either by RECQL4 forced expression or by
suppression, indicating that RECQL4 performs its functions
just downstream of AKT. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation
by treating the above cells with 1 mmol/L of MK-2206 (a p-AKT

inhibitor) for 2 hours speciﬁcally abolished YB1 phosphorylation (Fig. 4A and B). This ﬁnding together with an elevated
YB1–AKT interaction by the increased RECQL4 protein input
(Fig. 3E) suggests that RECQL4 promotes AKT-mediated YB1
phosphorylation probably through facilitating the recruitment
of YB1 to AKT by some unknown mechanism.
RECQL4 status affects the expression of YB1-targeted genes
We next wished to verify whether RECQL4 affects the expression of YB1-targeted genes such as MDR1 and MVP (26, 30)
through modulating p-YB1 level. To this aim, we used qRT-PCR
to quantify the mRNA levels of a list of drug-resistance–related
genes, including MDR1, MRP1-MRP4, BCRP, and MVP. The
primer sets for a list of drug resistance-related genes were listed
in Supplementary Table S4. As shown in Fig. 5A, only two of the
YB1-targeted genes, MDR1 and MVP, were markedly upregulated
upon RECQL4 induction in MGC-803/Tet-on/Flag-RECQL4 cells.
Elevated MDR1 and MVP proteins upon RECQL4 induction was
validated by Western blotting (Fig. 5A). We further tested MDR1
and MVP protein levels in gastric cancer cell lines with varying
expression levels of RECQL4. Consistently, cell lines with high
RECQL4 expression (AGS, HGC-27, NCI-N87, SNU-16) had a

3062 Cancer Res; 76(10) May 15, 2016

much higher MDR1 at both mRNA and protein levels relative to
cell lines with lower RECQL4 expression (MGC-803, MKN45, and
SNU-1; Fig. 5B). Three gastric cancer cell lines (AGS, NCI-N87,
and SNU-16) with high RECQL4 expression also have a higher
MVP expression at both mRNA and protein levels. HGC-27 cells
were found to be an exception with low MVP expression despite a
high endogenous RECQL4 expression (Fig. 5C). Consistent with
the potentiation of YB1 phosphorylation by RECQL4, expression
of YB1 target genes was also enhanced as a function of RECQL4
expression.
RECQL4 regulates MDR1 expression in an YB1-dependent
manner
First, MDR1 expression was quantiﬁed by real-time RT-PCR in
RECQL4-suppressed AGS cells with or without YB1 suppression.
As shown in Fig. 6A, suppression of either YB1 or RECQL4 led to a
decreased MDR1 expression, whereas no synergistic effect was
observed with simultaneous silencing of both YB1 and RECQL4.
Luciferase reporter assay was then employed in a reconstituted
system to determine whether the regulation of MDR1 expression
by RECQL4 is dependent on YB1 or not. Native YB1 was ﬁrst

RECQL4 Modulates MDR1 Expression and Chemoresistance

Figure 6.
RECQL4 regulates MDR1 in an YB1-dependent manner. A, MDR1 expression was quantiﬁed by real-time RT-PCR in AGS cells after YB1 and/ RECQL4
suppression. RECQL4 antibody from Cell Signaling Technology was used. B, effect of YB1 and RECQL4 on MDR1 promoter activity was determined by a
reconstitution assay in MGC-803/Tet-on/Flag-RECQL4 cells. Protein levels of RECQL4 (antibody from Novus Biologicals), p-YB1, and p-AKT as well as
relative luciferase activity were then determined. C, YB1 binding ability to MDR1 promoter region was quantiﬁed by a PCR-based ChIP assay. Values represent
the mean  SD from three independent experiments.

mediated YB1 shRNA. MDR1 promoter reporter plasmid was then
cotransfected with YB1-expressing plasmid with or without
RECQL4 induction. Luciferase activities were measured at 72
hours after transfection. As shown in Fig. 6B, MDR1 promoter
activity was at a very low level in YB1-silenced cells; however, it
was markedly increased by about 5-fold after YB1 reconstitution.
In addition, only RECQL4 induction in YB1-suppressed cells
failed to activate the MDR1 promoter. In contrast, reconstitution
of both RECQL4 and YB1 signiﬁcantly increased the MDR1
promoter activity in relative to YB1 reconstitution or RECQL4
induction only (Fig. 6B). p-AKT inhibition by treating the cells
with 1 mmol/L of MK-2206 (a p-AKT inhibitor) for 2 hours
speciﬁcally abolished the YB1 phosphorylation and subsequent
MDR1 activation even in the presence of RECQL4 induction.
These results convincingly demonstrate that MDR1 expression is
dependent on RECQL4-mediated transactivation potential of
YB1. As with MDR1 promoter, MVP promoter activation was also
observed by a luciferase reporter assay upon reconstitution of
either YB1 alone or YB1 and RECQL4 in YB1-silenced MGC-803/
Tet-on/Flag-RECQL4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S7), suggesting
that both of MDR1 and MVP are downstream of RECQL4-YB1
signal pathway.
We further carried out in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift
assay (EMSA) and demonstrated both a direct binding of YB1
protein and a YB1-dependent binding of RECQL4 protein to
MDR1 promoter (Supplementary Fig. S8). To evaluate the
binding efﬁciency of YB1 to MDR1 promoter, a qPCR-based
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed
in MGC-803/Tet-on/Flag-RECQL4 cells. As shown in Fig. 6C,
YB1 binding to MDR1 promoter was increased by more than
7-fold when RECQL4 was induced, further pointing to the

critical role of RECQL4 in regulating YB1 and MDR1
activation.
RECQL4 expression level governs cellular sensitivity to cisplatin
We next determined whether cisplatin sensitivity is altered after
modulating RECQL4 expression in gastric cancer cells or not. As
shown in Fig. 7A, forced RECQL4 expression in gastric cancer cells
(MKN45, SNU-1, and MGC-803) led to an increased level of
MDR1, MVP, and p-YB1, and consequently, a signiﬁcantly higher
cellular viability after cisplatin treatment when compared with
their controls. Conversely, both a suppressed level of MDR1, MVP,
and p-YB1, and a signiﬁcantly decreased cellular viability were
observed after RECQL4 suppression in NCI-N87 and AGS cells
when exposed to different concentrations of cisplatin (Fig. 7B).
RECQL4 suppression in HGC-27 cells led to reduced p-YB1 and
MDR1 levels as expected but MVP level was not altered, suggesting
that RECQL4–YB1–MDR1 axis is critical for cisplatin sensitivity.
The ﬁndings also imply that the role of MVP in drug sensitivity is
not essential, yet all the responding cells with exception of HGC27 show a positive correlation between MVP expression level and
drug sensitivity modulated by RECQL4.

Discussion
The most commonly used treatment regimen in gastric cancer is
cisplatin-based chemotherapy (28); however, many gastric cancer
patients have cancer recurrence after initial therapy and become
refractory to chemotherapy following treatment. Thus, acquisition of cisplatin resistance is a major clinical obstacle for successful treatment of gastric cancer. However, the molecular basis for
cisplatin resistance in gastric cancer is not clearly understood. In

RECQL4 Modulates MDR1 Expression and Chemoresistance

this study, we have presented a number of novel features that
suggest prognostic and therapeutic signiﬁcance of RECQL4 in
gastric cancer: (i) increased expression in gastric cancer cell lines
and primary clinical samples; (ii) correlation between high cytoplasmic or nuclear/cytoplasmic expression of RECQL4 with poor
survival of gastric cancer patients; (iii) correlation between high
RECQL4 expression with cisplatin resistance; (iv) identiﬁcation of
physical and functional interaction of RECQL4 with a major
transcription factor YB1; (v) promotion of RECQL4-mediated
YB1 phosphorylation by AKT; and (vi) transcriptional activation
of a multidrug resistance gene MDR1 by YB1 is regulated by
RECQL4 expression.
We have utilized 7 different gastric cancer cells lines in this
study, whose genetic makeup is expected to be different from one
another. Furthermore, mutational spectrum of genes and the
number of genes mutated may also considerably vary. These
intrinsic features may inﬂuence their cellular phenotypes in vitro
especially when these cells are challenged by exogenous DNA
damage causing agents such as cisplatin. In spite of the intrinsic
variations, a reasonably good correlation between RECQL4
expression and cisplatin sensitivity was observed in most of the
gastric cancer cell lines used in this study. Although cisplatin
resistance was only marginally increased by forced RECQL4
expression in some of the gastric cancer cell lines with low
endogenous RECQL4 expression, the acquired resistance was
found to be statistically signiﬁcant. It is likely that other unidentiﬁed mechanism(s) independent of RECQL4 may also contribute
to chemoresistance phenotype in gastric cancer cells.
Demonstration of a physical interaction, for the ﬁrst time in this
study between RECQL4 and YB1, indicates the functional significance of RECQL4 upregulation in carcinogenic process (31, 32).
YB1 is an oncogenic transcription/translation factor that is overexpressed in a number of cancer types, and is frequently associated
with poor outcome and chemotherapy resistance (27, 33). Being a
substrate of AKT, YB1 can be phosphorylated at serine 102 by AKT,
which is required for YB1 nuclear translocation in cancer cells (28,
34). In support, we found that RECQL4 substantially enhances
the interaction between AKT and YB1, resulting in an increased
level of p-YB1, illustrating a functional link between RECQL4
overexpression and YB1 activation. Moreover, our data suggest
that RECQL4 functions just downstream of AKT and modulates
AKT-dependent YB1 phosphorylation possibly by forming a
functional complex with AKT through YB1.
Overexpression of the MDR1 gene and corresponding P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efﬂux pumps is one of the best characterized
MDR mechanisms, leading to resistance to a wide variety of
anticancer agents in many types of human cancers (35–37).
MDR1 expression was shown to be regulated by transcription
factors such as YB1 (35). Previous studies have illustrated a
plausible association between YB1 and drug resistance in both
cultured cancer cells and clinical tumor samples (38, 39). How-

ever, there are certain gaps in our understanding with regard to
how YB1 becomes activated to induce the expression of MDR1 in
cancer cells. Here, we provided evidence that induced expression
of RECQL4 in MGC-803/Tet-on/Flag-RECQL4 cells led to a
markedly increased level of MDR1 expression. In particular, a
fair correlation between RECQL4 status and MDR1 level was
observed in gastric cancer cell lines tested. Moreover, ectopic
expression of RECQL4 in gastric cancer cells was observed to
enhance the YB1 phosphorylation and further its nuclear translocation, and vice versa. The results of luciferase reporter and
ChIP–qPCR assays showed that RECQL4 has the potential to
modulate MDR1 promoter activity in an YB1-dependent manner.
This ﬁnding attributes an essential role to RECQL4 in regulating
the chemoresistance of gastric cancer cells through regulation of
YB1–AKT–MDR1 downstream pathway.
On the basis of our ﬁndings, we suggest that RECQL4 is a novel
therapeutic target for gastric cancer and efﬁcient RECQL4-mediated targeting of AKT–YB1–MDR1 pathway is an effective treatment strategy for chemosensitization of gastric cancer. Because
RECQL4 has demonstrated roles in DNA replication and repair
(40, 41), RECQL4 targeting may have additional advantages for
cancer therapy.
