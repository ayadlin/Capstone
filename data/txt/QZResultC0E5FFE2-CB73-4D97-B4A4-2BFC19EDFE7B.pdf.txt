Abstract
Antibody–drug conjugates (ADC) target cytotoxic drugs to
antigen-positive cells for treating cancer. After internalization,
ADCs with noncleavable linkers are catabolized to amino acidlinker-warheads within the lysosome, which then enter the cytoplasm by an unknown mechanism. We hypothesized that a
lysosomal transporter was responsible for delivering noncleavable ADC catabolites into the cytoplasm. To identify candidate
transporters, we performed a phenotypic shRNA screen with an
anti-CD70 maytansine-based ADC. This screen revealed the lysosomal membrane protein SLC46A3, the genetic attenuation of
which inhibited the potency of multiple noncleavable antibody–

maytansine ADCs, including ado-trastuzumab emtansine. In
contrast, the potencies of noncleavable ADCs carrying the structurally distinct monomethyl auristatin F were unaffected by
SLC46A3 attenuation. Structure–activity experiments suggested
that maytansine is a substrate for SLC46A3. Notably, SLC46A3
silencing led to relative increases in catabolite concentrations in
the lysosome. Taken together, our results establish SLC46A3 as a
direct transporter of maytansine-based catabolites from the lysosome to the cytoplasm, prompting further investigation of
SLC46A3 as a predictive response marker in breast cancer specimens. Cancer Res; 75(24); 5329–40. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

auristatin monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), are potent molecules in the single digit nanomolar to picomolar range. Once
released, DM1, DM4, and MMAE are capable of bystander
activity, killing target-negative cells (4, 5). Two warhead families are well established to generate active ADCs with noncleavable linkers, maytansinoids including DM1 and DM4 (6,
7) and monomethyl auristatin F (8). ADCs with noncleavable
linkers kill target cells following a stepwise process of (i)
antibody binding to cell surface target, (ii) ADC internalization into the endolysosomal pathway, (iii) catabolism of ADC
in the lysosome to liberate amino acid-linker-warhead (9), (iv)
catabolite exit from lysosome to cytoplasm, and (v) catabolite
interaction with intracellular target. Unlike warheads released
from cleavable linker ADCs, catabolites of noncleavable linker
ADCs do not penetrate cell membranes and consequently do
not generate bystander activity (4). While the generation of
amino acid-linker-warhead from noncleavable linker ADCs
and their subsequent ability to mediate cell death once in the
cytoplasm are well established, the mechanism of noncleavable linker catabolite exit from the lysosome into the cytoplasm
is unknown.
Gene silencing (10) is a powerful tool frequently used to deﬁne
genes important for cell division (11), survival (12), and sensitization of cells to chemotherapy agents (13, 14). In addition,
phenotypic screening has been used to identify genes involved
in the mechanism of action of molecules (15). To deﬁne
genes involved in catabolite transport from the lysosome to the
cytoplasm, a noncleavable maytansine-based ADC, anti-CD70
Ab-MCC-DM1, was evaluated in positive selection phenotypic
shRNA screens that identiﬁed solute carrier family 46 member

Two antibody–drug conjugates (ADC), brentuximab vedotin (1) and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (2), are currently
approved for the treatment of cancer. Several ADCs are currently under investigation in clinical trials, many of which
employ the same antitubulin agents in brentuximab vedotin
and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, auristatins, and maytansinoids, respectively (3). The majority of ADCs in the clinic,
including brentuximab vedotin, employ a cleavable linker,
which, following internalization and activation within the
cell, releases a warhead from the linker. Cleavable linker
warheads, such as the maytansinoids DM1 and DM4, and the

A3 (SLC46A3). Validation experiments using different linkerwarhead systems and cell surface targets demonstrated that
SLC46A3 regulates the lysosomal concentration of the AbMCC-DM1 catabolite Lysine-MCC-DM1. These results support
a role for SLC46A3 in the transport of the noncleavable linker
ADC catabolite Lysine-MCC-DM1 from the lysosome into the
cytoplasm.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
786-0 cells were originally obtained from ATCC and passaged in RPMI þ 10% FBS. U251vIII cells were obtain from Dr.
Darell Bigner (Duke University, Durham, NC) and passaged in
DMEM þ 10% FBS. SK-BR-3 cells were obtained from ATCC
and were passaged in McCoys þ 10% FBS. Cell lines were not
authenticated.
Reagents
Synthesis of 40 bromomaytansine. Scheme 1. Maytansinol (1, 0.10 g,
1.0 equiv) and benzene (1.0 mL) were charged to a round bottom
ﬂask. The solution was concentrated to an oil and backﬁlled with
N2(g) to dry the ﬂask and contents (repeated  3). N,N-dimethylformamide (0.5 mL), tetrahydrofuran (1.0 mL), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (0.19 mL, 3.0 equiv), and a magnetic stirbar were
charged to the ﬂask at ambient temperature to generate a slightly
yellow homogeneous solution. (S)-3,4-dimethyloxazolidine-2,5dione (2, 0.114 g, 5.0 equiv) was charged to the solution, followed
by zinc triﬂuoromethanesulfonate (0.193 g, 3.0 equiv) to generate

a heterogeneous mixture, which was sealed and aged overnight
at ambient temperature. The following day, an additional 1.5
equiv of (S)-3,4-dimethyloxazolidine-2,5-dione (0.034 g) was
charged to the mixture, and the slurry was aged overnight at
ambient temperature. The reaction was quenched by charging
2.0 mL 10% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid aq. solution (1.1
equiv relative to zincþ2) and 2.0 mL 5 mol/L sodium chloride
aq. solution. The aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate
(4.0 mL  2), and the combined ethyl acetate extract was
washed with 2.0 mL 5 mol/L sodium chloride solution. The
ethyl acetate solution was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated, and puriﬁed by silica chromatography
(100% dichloromethane to 10% methanol:dichloromethane)
to provide 98 mg of N-Me-Ala-O-maytansinol (3) as a yellow
oil in 60% potency adjusted yield.
N-Me-Ala-O-maytansinol (3, 65 mg, 1.0 equiv), dichloromethane (1.7 mL), and a magnetic stirbar were charged to a
round bottom ﬂask. N,N-Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (70 mg,
3.4 equiv) and 2-bromoacetic acid (47 mg, 3.4 equiv) were
sequentially charged to form a white slurry, and the ﬂask was
sealed and aged overnight at ambient temperature. The slurry was
puriﬁed by silica chromatography (2% methanol:dichloromethane) to provide 63 mg of 40 -bromomaytansine (4) as a
white powder in 74% potency adjusted yield.
Synthesis of N-Me-Ala-O-maytansinol-DSG-NHS. Scheme 2. N-MeAla-O-maytansinol (3, 5.6 mg, 8.61 mmol), bis(2,5-dioxopyrrolidin-1-yl) glutarate (5, 14.05 mg, 5.0 equiv), and N,N-dimethylpyridin-4-amine (1.052 mg, 1.0 equiv) were charged to a vial

Synthesis of DM1-SMCC.

containing a magnetic stirbar. DMF (100 mL) was charged to the
vial to generate a homogeneous solution, and the vial was sealed
and aged overnight at ambient temperature. Upon reaction completion, 1.0 mL ethyl acetate and 2.0 mL 5% sodium chloride
aq. solution was charged. The phases were separated, and the
aqueous phase was extracted with 1.0 mL ethyl acetate. The
combined organic phases were washed with brine, dried with
anhydrous sodium sulfate, concentrated, and puriﬁed by
silica chromatography (3% methanol:dichloromethane to 5%
methanol:dichloromethane) to provide N-Me-O-maytansinolDGS-NHS (6) as an oil.
Synthesis of DM1-SMCC. Scheme 3. DM1 (7, 1081 mg, 1.27
mmol), SMCC (512 mg, 1.53 mmol), diisopropylethylamine
(22.2 mL, 0.127 mmol), and dry chloroform (21.6 mL) were
charged to a 100 mL round bottom ﬂask equipped with a
magnetic stir bar. The mixture was stirred at room temperature
under an atmosphere of nitrogen overnight. The mixture was
concentrated to a residue at 40 C and reduced pressure on a
rotovap to yield a solid residue. The residue was puriﬁed by
preparative HPLC (Luna Silica, 21.2  150 mm, 5 mm column;
20 mL/minute isocratic elution; 20% acetonitrile/MTBE) to yield
994 mg of DM1-SMCC (8) as a white solid (73% yield, potency
adjusted).
Generation of ADC
Anti-EGFRvIII Ab-MCC-DM1 was conjugated as previously
described (16). Anti-EGFRvIII Ab-mcMMAF and anti-CD70 AbmcMMAF were generated as previously (8) described using
mcMMAF (The Chemistry Research Solutions).
Anti-CD70 antibody was conjugated to DM1-SMCC (8) to
generate anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1. Brieﬂy, anti-CD70 antibody
in 50 mmol/L potassium phosphate, 2 mmol/L EDTA, pH 7.5 was
mixed with a 12-fold molar excess of DM1-SMCC in dimethylacetamide (DMAC) at room temperature for 90 minutes, followed by 4 C overnight incubation. Final anti-CD70 Ab-MCCDM1 had a drug–antibody ratio (DAR) of 4.8.
Anti-CD70 Ab-DSG-maytansine was generated by conjugating
anti-CD70 antibody to N-Me-Ala-O-maytansinol-DSG-NHS (6).
Brieﬂy, anti-CD70 antibody in 50 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
pH 8.5 was mixed with a 5-fold molar excess of N-Me-Ala-Omaytansinol-DSG-NHS at room temperature for 90 minutes,
followed by 4 C overnight incubation. Final anti-CD70 AbDSG-maytansine had a DAR of 4.4.
Anti-CD70 Ab-Cys-maytansine was generated by conjugating a
site-speciﬁc cysteine mutant of the anti-CD70 antibody with 40 bromomaytansine (4). Brieﬂy, anti-CD70 Ab-Cys was reduced

with tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP) for 2
hours at room temperature. Excess TCEP was removed by amicon
spin columns. (L)-Dehydroascorbic Acid (DHAA) was added to
reoxidize native disulﬁde bonds for 2 hours at room temperature.
A 10-fold molar excess of 40 -bromomaytansine was added to the
reduced antibody for 2 hours to generate anti-CD70 Ab-CysMaytansine with a DAR of 1.8.
For generation of trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 conjugate DM1 was
purchased from Carbosynth to generate DM1-SMCC as described
above. Trastuzumab in conjugation buffer (50 nmol/L boric acid,
50 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.5 was mixed at room
temperature with DM1-SMCC (8) in DMAC for 70 minutes. The
ADC was buffer exchanged to 10 mmol/L sodium acetate, 9%
sucrose, 0.01% PS20, pH 5.0 using a 10 mL 7 kDa Zeba Spin
desalting column according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 had a DAR of 3.9.
shRNA library synthesis, screening, and statistcal analysis
shRNA libraries 1 and 2 were designed to target 1,276 and 1,325
genes, respectively. Libraries were synthesized by Cellecta with an
average of 19 and 18 shRNAs per gene for libraries 1 and 2,
respectively. Each shRNA was synthesized with a unique barcode.
Both libraries included shRNAs to 30 genes with no cell growth
phenotype after knockdown, and 17 genes previously demonstrated as essential for cell growth for internal controls (data not
shown). For screens, 786-0 cells were transduced with lentiviral
packaged shRNAs at 3,000 cells/shRNA at an MOI of 0.3 such that
the majority of infectants contained single integrations. Transduced cells were selected in puromycin. One thousand cells/
shRNA were exposed to ADC for 96 hours and remaining cells
were expanded for an additional 96 hours in the absence of ADC.
Cells were harvested and barcodes were PCR-ampliﬁed and
sequenced using an Illumina sequencer (Cellecta Inc) as previously described (17). The number of reads of each shRNA barcode
was normalized to reads per 40 million total reads (the typical
read depth in each experiment) to correct for variations in read
depth in each experiment. shRNAs with fewer than 50 reads
per 40 million in the control arm were excluded from analysis.
The effect of each shRNA on ADC function was quantiﬁed using
the value: log[(reads/40 million ADC-treated experiment)/
(reads/40 million untreated experiment)]. The values for duplicate shRNAs were averaged to generate a single value for each
shRNA. The approximately 18 to 19 independent shRNAs/gene
were used to estimate a P value for each gene as previously
described (18), which was then used to calculate a q-value
corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the method of
Hochberg and Benjamini (19).

anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 or media (control) for four days. Cells were washed and replated for another four days to expand remaining cells in the absence of ADC.
Cells were collected for bar code sequencing. B, library 1 and library 2 q-value plotted as a function of gene rank; line indicates q value of 0.05.

Cell viability experiments
Cells were transfected with 3 to 4 independent siRNA sequences
per gene, each independent siRNA was assayed in either duplicate
or triplicate. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were
exposed to ADC. Cell growth was either monitored continuously
by Incucyte (Essen BioScience) or after 72 hours ADC exposure
using Cell Titer Glo (Promega). Luminescence was measured
using an Envision plate reader (Perkin Elmer).

Statistical analysis
Comparison of siRNA effect on cell viability following ADC
exposure was determined using one-way ANOVA with Tukey
multiple comparisons correction. Comparison of lysosomal
Lysine-MCC-DM1 concentrations normalized to total lysate
Lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration (Fig. 4B) was determined using
a t test. ANOVA and t tests were performed in GraphPad Prism
version 6.05.

Lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration
Lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration in cell lysate and lysosomes
was assessed in 786-0 cells in a 6-well plate as previously described
(9). For siRNA experiments, 24 hours after plating cells, 5 nmol/L
SLC46A3-speciﬁc or nontargeting siRNA in OptiMEM and RNAi
Max was added to cells (Life Technologies). Twenty-four hours
later, the medium was removed and replaced with 10% RPMI.
After 24 hours, 786-0 cells were treated with 3 or 10 nmol/L antiCD70 antibody-MCC-DM1, based on DM1 concentration. Plates
were placed in an Incucyte or in a standard incubator, which at
various times media was removed and cells were frozen for total
lysate generation or used to isolate lysosomes followed by liquid
chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) measurement of Lysine-MCC-DM1 as previously described (9).

shRNA screens identiﬁed CD70 and SLC46A3 as critical
mediators of anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1–dependent cytotoxicity
Cell surface target expression and lysosomal function have
been shown to be critical for the potency of noncleavable linker
of ADCs (6, 8). Anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 is a potent noncleavable linker ADC targeting the cell surface protein CD70, which is
expressed on the renal cell carcinoma line 786-0. Screens employing two distinct custom shRNA libraries were performed to
identify genes involved in noncleavable linker maytansine ADC
(anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1) catabolite transport from the lysosome to cytoplasm. Library 1 contained genes annotated as
membrane proteins, predominantly cell surface proteins, while

Lysosomal Transport of Noncleavable Maytansine ADC Warhead

library 2 was designed to include genes annotated to have transporter function or lysosomal localization (20–22), approximately
35 amino acid transporter genes, and genes that regulate lysosomal function consisting of 14 lysosmal ATPase subunits. The
shRNA libraries were screened in 786-0 cells using cell survival as a
readout (Fig. 1A). A hit was deﬁned as (i) signiﬁcantly different qvalue of anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 relative to cells under normal
growth conditions and (ii) a membrane protein with either
unknown function or known transporter function, excluding
lysosomal ATPase subunits, which transport Hþ into lysosomes.
As expected, given the target speciﬁc nature of the anti-CD70 AbMCC-DM1, CD70 was the most signiﬁcant gene in both screens
with q-values of 1.59  1027 and 1.30  1025 in libraries 1 and
2, respectively (Fig. 1B). Genes involved in endosomal/lysosomal
trafﬁcking (Rab7A), lysosomal biogenesis (mTor), and lysosomal
function (multiple ATPase subunits, V1B2, V1D, V1A, and V0C)
were identiﬁed in the screens, but not deﬁned as hits (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). A number of proteins identiﬁed in the

screens were not classiﬁed as hits due to nonmembrane localization, including ribosomal protein components (RPL3, RPS6,
and RPS3A). SLC46A3, a lysosomal membrane protein (21) with
unknown function, was the only hit identiﬁed with q-values of
1.18  109 and 9.01  103 in libraries 1 and 2, respectively (Fig.
1B). SLC46A3 is a member of the major facilitator superfamily,
with highest homology to its subfamily of solute carrier family
members SLC46A1 and SLC46A2 (33% and 27%, respectively).
SLC46A1 is expressed in intestine, brain, and kidney, and transports folate in a proton-dependent manner (23). SLC46A2 is
expressed in thymic epithelia and the epididymal duct, but its
substrates have not been identiﬁed (24, 25). RNA sequence
analysis of normal tissue indicated SLC46A3 is expressed at low
levels in 786-0 cells as well as most tissues (26, 27). The predicted
structure for SLC46A3 suggests it contains 12 transmembrane
spanning domains (Supplementary Fig. S1), similar to SLC46A1
(28) and SLC46A2 (24). Identiﬁcation of a solute carrier family
member localized in the lysosomal membrane warranted

additional experimentation of SLC46A3 to validate its role in
noncleavable linker ADC catabolite transport.
SLC46A3 is required for maytansine-based noncleavable ADC
activity and is independent of cell surface target
To verify SLC46A3's role in noncleavable linker ADC mechanism of action, gene expression was knocked down in 786-0 cells
using highly selective siRNAs in the presence of anti-CD70 AbMCC-DM1. CD70-speciﬁc siRNAs reduced mRNA levels of CD70
(Supplementary Fig. S2), surface expression of CD70 (Supple-

mentary Fig. S3), and, as expected, reduced the potency of antiCD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 (Fig. 2A). siRNA-mediated reduction of
SLC46A3 expression was evaluated using mRNA expression (Supplementary Fig. S2), as commercially available antibodies were
not speciﬁc or sensitive enough to detect endogenous levels of
SLC46A3. Figure 2A demonstrates that siRNA knockdown of
SLC46A3 mRNA attenuates the potency of anti-CD70 AbMCC-DM1 compared with nontargeting siRNAs. To characterize
the breadth of SLC46A3's role in noncleavable linker ADC mechanism of action, two additional ADCs each directed against a

Lysosomal Transport of Noncleavable Maytansine ADC Warhead

different cell surface target employing the same noncleavable
linker technology, anti-EGFRvIII Ab-MCC-DM1 and ado-trastuzumab emtansine (trastuzumab-MCC-DM1) were evaluated on
target-expressing tumor cells to determine whether the effect of
SLC46A3 on ADC function was cell surface target or cell line
speciﬁc. EGFRvIII is a deletion mutant of exons 2–7 of EGFR (29).
The potency of anti-EGFRvIII Ab-MCC-DM1 against U251vIII
cells (Fig. 2B) and trastuzumab-MCC-DM1 against SK-BR-3 cells
(Fig. 2C) were attenuated by selective SLC46A3 mRNA knockdown, establishing that the role of SLC46A3 affecting Ab-MCCDM1 potency is not speciﬁc to a cell surface target or cell line.
SLC46A3 is required for maytansine-based noncleavable
warhead ADC potency but not auristatin-based noncleavable
warhead ADC potency
To address the hypothesis that SLC46A3 is involved in maytansine-based catabolite transport from the lysosome to the
cytoplasm ADCs utilizing the noncleavable linker warhead
MMAF were generated. Anti-CD70 Ab-mcMMAF potency in
786-0 cells was unaffected by selective SLC46A3 knockdown (Fig.
2D). Similar to anti-CD70 Ab-mcMMAF, neither anti-EGFRvIII
Ab-mcMMAF (Fig. 2E) nor trastuzumab-mcMMAF (Fig. 2F) were
affected by selective SLC46A3 knockdown in U251vIII or SK-BR-3
cells, respectively, suggesting that a distinct structural element
within lysine-MCC-DM1 is recognized by SLC46A3.
To determine whether structural elements of the linker in
anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 are important for recognition by
SLC46A3, the linker between maytansine and the anti-CD70
antibody was replaced with a simple glutaric acid spacer. A bisactivated glutaric acid was ﬁrst reacted with maytansine then
the anti-CD70 antibody to generate anti-CD70 Ab-DSG-maytansine, which is catabolized to lysine-DSG-maytansine. Potency of anti-CD70 Ab-DSG-maytansine was similar to anti-CD70
Ab-MCC-DM1 (Supplementary Fig. S4) demonstrating that
cyclohexane in MCC is not a critical component for ADC

potency. Knockdown of SLC46A3 attenuated the potency of
anti-CD70 Ab-DSG-maytansine compared with nontargeting
siRNA (Fig. 3B), similar to the attenuation observed with antiCD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 (Fig. 3A) indicating that the linker component was unlikely recognized by SLC46A3. Cysteines are
frequently used to conjugate auristatins and other drugs to
antibodies, thus, maytansine was conjugated directly to an
engineered site-speciﬁc cysteine of the anti-CD70 antibody to
determine the effect of SLC46A3 on a different amino acid
present in the catabolite. The resulting anti-CD70 Ab-Cysmaytansine is catabolized into Cys-maytansine in the cell, and
is potent against 786-0 cells (Supplementary Fig. S4). The
potency of anti-CD70 Ab-Cys-maytansine was attenuated upon
knockdown of SLC46A3 (Fig. 3C), indicating SLC46A3 function is not speciﬁc to the lysine residue attached to the maytansine species. Similar to the endpoint assay (Fig. 2D), antiCD70 Ab-mcMMAF potency was attenuated by knockdown of
CD70 similar to the maytansine-based ADCs. However, in
contrast to the maytansine ADCs, the anti-CD70 Ab-mcMMAF
potency was not affected by SLC46A3 knockdown (Fig. 3D).
These results, speciﬁcally the lack of sensitivity to the linker or
amino acid component of the catabolites, suggest that
SLC46A3 recognizes maytansine or a moiety within the maytansine scaffold.

Methods were recently developed to measure lysine-MCCDM1 by LC/MS-MS in total cell lysates and the lysosomal fractions
of mammalian cells to assess the intracellular fate of noncleavable
linker ADCs (9). 786-0 cells treated with anti-CD70 Ab-MCCDM1 generated low yet measurable levels of the ADC catabolite
lysine-MCC-DM1 6 hours after treatment with the ADC. The total
cell lysate concentration of lysine-MCC-DM1 increased as a

function of time in culture with the ADC (Fig. 4A), continuing
through 48 hours (Supplementary Fig. S5). Within the lysosome
the concentration of lysine-MCC-DM1 had a distinctly different
proﬁle than the total cell lysate. Nine hours after ADC treatment
the concentration of lysine-MCC-DM1 in the lysosome was
similar to the total cell lysate concentration (Fig. 4A). Twelve
hours after ADC treatment, the lysosomal concentration of
Lysine-MCC-DM1 peaked and was approximately 3.5-fold higher
than at 24 hours. Lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration in the lysosome decreased from 12 to 18 hours, after which the levels
stabilized. Lysosome levels of Lysine-MCC-DM1 were signiﬁcantly higher at 12 hours compared with 24 hours (P < 0.0001) as
shown in Fig. 4B.
SLC46A3 knockdown attenuates the postpeak decrease of
lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration in the lysosome following
anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 treatment
To determine the functional role of SLC46A3 knockdown the
concentration of the catabolite lysine-MCC-DM1 was measured
in the total cell lysate and lysosome in the presence of the selective
siRNA knockdown of SLC46A3 mRNA or nontargeting siRNA
knockdown following anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 treatment.
Despite the larger cell numbers required for lysine-MCC-DM1
concentration measurements, siSLC46A3-mediated knockdown
attenuated the potency of anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 (Supplementary Fig. S6) to a similar extent to that observed in smaller scale
experiments (Fig. 3A). Total cell lysate lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration was comparable between cells exposed to nontargeting
and SLC46A3 siRNAs at both the 12-hour and 24-hour timepoints
(Fig. 5A and C). Twelve hours after treatment with anti-CD70 AbMCC-DM1, the lysosomal concentration of lysine-MCC-DM1
was similar to the total cell lysate concentration in cells exposed
to both SLC46A3 and nontargeting siRNAs (Fig. 5B relative to Fig.
5A and Fig. 5D relative to Fig. 5C). After twenty-four hour
treatment with anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1, the lysosomal concentration of lysine-MCC-DM1 was markedly higher in cells where
selective SLC46A3 mRNA knockdown occurred as compared with
cells exposed to nontargeting siRNA, indicating a direct role for
SLC46A3 in regulation of the lysosomal concentration of lysineMCC-DM1 (Fig. 5B and D).

Discussion
Technology improvements during the past decade, including
improved warheads (1), linker stability (30, 31), optimization of
drug loading (32), and the in the case of ado-trastuzumab
emtansine, noncleavable linker technology (30) contributed to
the approval of two ADCs for clinical use. With hydrazone,
disulﬁde, and protease-based cleavable linkers the warheads
typically used are drugs with robust potency against a wide range
of cells, such as doxorubicin (33), MMAE (8), and maytansinoids
(34) DM1 and DM4. These warheads are hypothesized to freely
diffuse across cell membranes and the lysosomal membrane
(5, 35). Noncleavable linker ADCs generate warheads still
attached to amino acids, most notably cysteine-mcMMAF or
lysine-MCC-DM1, depending on the technology employed,
which were hypothesized to not readily diffuse across cell membranes (36). One ADC that employs maytansine-based noncleavable linker technology is ado-trastuzumab emtansine (30). Adotrastuzumab emtansine (trastuzumab-MCC-DM1) signiﬁcantly
improves overall survival in metastatic breast cancer patients (2),
yet, one key aspect of its mechanism of action, how the ADC

catabolite lysine-MCC-DM1 exits the lysosome and enters the
cytoplasm, remains unknown.
To elucidate genes involved in transport of the noncleavable
linker ADC catabolite lysine-MCC-DM1 from the lysosome to the
cytoplasm two shRNA libraries containing approximately 2,600
genes were screened employing a cell line exposed to anti-CD70
Ab-MCC-DM1. Functional screening with shRNA can be a powerful tool, however, prior screens using 3 to 7 shRNAs per gene
have been confounded by the frequency of false positives (37).
Using ricin susceptibility as a model, Bassik and colleagues
examined the number of shRNAs required to resolve signiﬁcant
P values for both weak and strong hits (38). Consequently, two
distinct shRNA libraries were designed consisting of 1,276 and
1,325 genes, in library 1 and library 2 respectively, with approximately 18 to 19 shRNAs per gene. As expected, the ADC cell
surface target, CD70, was the most signiﬁcant gene identiﬁed in
both screens, while SLC46A3, a gene member in the same family
of membrane transporters yet with unknown function, was the
only other gene identiﬁed in both screens.
Transporters play a role in the cellular inﬂux and efﬂux of
multiple pharmaceutical drugs (39), xenobiotics, amino acids, and
other small molecules such as folate. The development of genomic
screens has validated, and in some cases discovered, transporters
that deliver certain drugs into cells. A genome-wide assessment of
26 pharmaceutical drugs in yeast identiﬁed the transporters for 18
compounds that when deleted impacted potency (40). Two studies
using genetic screens identiﬁed transporters that played a role in the
potency of the nucleoside antibiotic tunicamycin (41) and the
anticancer agent YM155 (42). The transporters identiﬁed in these
examples were cell surface transporters affecting the potency of
small molecules. SLC46A3 represents the ﬁrst lysosomal transporter identiﬁed that is necessary for the function of a noncleavable
linker maytansine-based ADC.
Maytansine-based noncleavable linker ADC potency was signiﬁcantly impacted by knockdown of SLC46A3. By evaluating the
effects of SLC46A3 knockdown on Ab-MCC-DM1 and AbmcMMAF on different cell surface targets (Fig. 2) we demonstrate
that SLC46A3 represents a broad underlying mechanism of maytansine ADCs with noncleavable linkers, not merely a cell line or
cell surface target–speciﬁc phenomenon. SLC46A3 likely recognizes the macrolide structure of maytansine as neither linker
structure nor a different amino acid impacted the ADC potency
attenuation of SLC46A3 knockdown (Fig. 3). MMAF, the only
other extensively characterized noncleavable linker warhead,
when delivered into cells as an ADC was not signiﬁcantly impacted by SLC46A3 knockdown. Maytansine's macrolide structure is
distinctly different from the pentapeptide MMAF, thus it is reasonable that if SLC46A3 is functioning as a transporter, only one
of these distinctly different structures would be a substrate for
SLC46A3. Potency of the MMAF ADCs were unaffected by
SLC46A3 knockdown, strongly suggesting the existence of a
distinct transport mechanism of Cys-mcMMAF from the lysosome into the cytoplasm. To functionally validate SLC46A3 in its
native environment, we measured lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration in the lysosome. Measurement of lysine-MCC-DM1 in the
lysosome by LC/MS-MS is a technically challenging low-throughput endeavor, typically generating n ¼ 1 per condition or timepoint. Despite the low sample size, the inter-assay coefﬁcient of
variation (%CV) ranged between 8% and 15%, indicating the
precision of the assay measurements. SLC46A3 knockdown did
not affect the cumulative rate of internalization, trafﬁcking to

Lysosomal Transport of Noncleavable Maytansine ADC Warhead

Functional effect of SLC46A3 on lysine-MCC-DM1 concentration. 786-0 cells were transfected with nontargeting or SLC46A3 siRNAs. Twenty-four hours
after transfection, cells were treated with 3 nmol/L (A and B) or 10 nmol/L (C and D) anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 for 12 or 24 hours. Total cell lysate

lysosomes, and catabolism of anti-CD70 Ab-MCC-DM1 into
lysine-MCC-DM1 as evidenced by the similar total cell lysate
concentrations of lysine-MCC-DM1 with either siSLC46A3 or
nontargeting siRNA at both 12 and 24 hours (Fig. 5A and C).
While lysine-MCC-DM1 accumulated in the lysosome upon
SLC46A3 knockdown at 24 hours it did not reach the concentration of the total cell lysate, suggesting either incomplete knockdown of SLC46A3 with siRNA, or perhaps another transporter
capable of transporting lysine-MCC-DM1 from the lysosome to
cytoplasm, or another mechanism. While the SLC46A3 knockdown led to lysosomal accumulation of lysine-MCC-DM1 has a
limited number of biologic replicates the inter-assay precision of
the lysosome concentration measurement suggests that the accumulation observed at 24 hours is robust and reproducible. In
future studies it would be of interest to assess the lysosomal
accumulation of lysine-MCC-DM1 following ADC treatment in
the complete absence of SLC46A3 expression. Our experimental
results show that SLC46A3 is necessary for transport of lysineMCC-DM1 from the lysosome to the cytoplasm following ADC

catabolism to enable on-target inhibition of tubulin polymerization. This data is summarized in a model for noncleavable
linker maytansine ADCs in Fig. 6, where upon lysosomal catabolism SLC46A3 transports catabolites into the cytoplasm.
Of the three SLC46 family members, substrates have only been
identiﬁed for SLC46A1, also known as the proton coupled folate
transporter, which transports folate (23), and to a lesser extent
heme (43), from the lumen of the jejunum and duodenum into
cells in a pH-dependent fashion as it is expressed on the apical
membrane (44). SLC46A1 was not found to be enriched in any of
the shRNA screens performed, suggesting that it does not recognize and transport lysine-MCC-DM1, or lacked the relevant
cofactor in the screen, thus it is unknown if SLC46A1 and
SCL46A3 may share substrates. Other families of transporters,
such as Nramp (45) and the SLC15 (46) families, contain genes
where one or more members is/are expressed in the gut and
another member is expressed in the lysosome. In these cases, the
transporters in both the gut and the lysosome transport molecules
in a pH-dependent fashion. Furthermore, substrates can be shared

among family members despite expression on different membranes. Attempts to direct the lysosomal-localized Nramp1 to the
cell surface by swapping the N- and C-terminal domains of
Nramp1 with the cell surface–localized Nramp2 were unsuccessful (47). However, Nramp2 was localized to lysosomes when its N
terminus was replaced with the N-terminus of Nramp1, suggesting that Nramp1 may contain multiple lysosomal sorting motifs.
Multiple modiﬁcations to SLC46A3's proposed lysosomal sorting
motifs (48) to force expression on the cell surface were unsuccessful as single mutations (data not shown), suggesting that
similar to Nramp1 SLC46A3 may contain multiple lysosomal
localization sorting motifs. Without a cell surface assay, it is
challenging to validate that SLC46A3 alone is sufﬁcient to transport lysine-MCC-DM1 across membranes or to determine any
cofactors required for transport such as pH. Evaluation of pH as a
cofactor for lysosomal transport following ADC treatment is
complicated by the observation that proton pump inhibitors
such as baﬁlomycin prevent the formation of lysine-MCC-DM1
(9), presumably the lysosomal proteases that catabolize antibodies are pH dependent. Nevertheless, the identiﬁcation of
SLC46A3 as a lysosomal membrane protein (21), the speciﬁcity
of SLC46A3 for maytansine-based ADCs, and observation that
SLC46A3 impacts the lysosomal concentration of lysine-MCCDM1 (Fig. 5B and D) suggests that SLC46A3 is either a lysosomal
transporter or directly involved in the transport of lysine-MCCDM1 from lysosome to cytoplasm.
Cleavable linker ADCs exhibit potency with multiple warheads
including auristatins (1), maytansinoids (36) such as DM1 and
DM4, doxorubicin (33), calicheamicins (49), and pyrrolobenzodiazepines (50), whereas noncleavable linker ADCs are reported
to be successful only with maytansines and the auristatin MMAF.

DM1, and ado-trastuzumab emtansine, an approved treatment
for metastatic breast cancer. Attenuation of ado-trastuzumab
emtansine potency upon SLC46A3 knockdown in vitro, suggests
that similar consequences could occur in patients that may harbor
a defect in SLC46A3 levels or function. Little is known about the
potential effects of SLC46A3 polymorphisms, yet, interrogation of
clinical samples could clarify whether patient's SLC46A3 expression levels or single-nucleotide polymorphisms could impact the
potency of ado-trastuzumab emtansine or other maytansinebased ADCs that are currently in clinical development. Additional
studies interrogating clinical samples will be required to determine whether SLC46A3 expression can be used as a predictive
biomarker of ado-trastuzumab emtansine or other ADCs containing noncleavable linker maytansines. Identiﬁcation of SLC46A3, a
lysosomal protein required for transport of lysine-MCC-DM1
from the lysosome to the cytoplasm could lead to the discovery
of additional noncleavable linker warheads that can exit the
lysosome through SLC46A3 or with other lysosomal transporters.
