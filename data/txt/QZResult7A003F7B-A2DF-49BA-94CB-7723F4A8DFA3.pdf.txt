Abstract
The amount of genomic information about leukemia cells
currently far exceeds our overall understanding of the precise
genetic events that ultimately drive disease development and
progression. Effective implementation of personalized medicine will require tools to distinguish actionable genetic alterations within the complex genetic landscape of leukemia. In this
study, we performed kinase inhibitor screens to predict functional gene targets in primary specimens from patients with
acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myelomonocytic leukemia. Deep sequencing of the same patient specimens identiﬁed
genetic alterations that were then integrated with the functionally important targets using the HitWalker algorithm to prioritize the mutant genes that most likely explain the observed
drug sensitivity patterns. Through this process, we identiﬁed
tyrosine kinase nonreceptor 2 (TNK2) point mutations that

exhibited oncogenic capacity. Importantly, the integration of
functional and genomic data using HitWalker allowed for
prioritization of rare oncogenic mutations that may have been
missed through genomic analysis alone. These mutations were
sensitive to the multikinase inhibitor dasatinib, which antagonizes TNK2 kinase activity, as well as novel TNK2 inhibitors,
XMD8-87 and XMD16-5, with greater target speciﬁcity. We also
identiﬁed activating truncation mutations in other tumor types
that were sensitive to XMD8-87 and XMD16-5, exemplifying
the potential utility of these compounds across tumor types
dependent on TNK2. Collectively, our ﬁndings highlight a
more sensitive approach for identifying actionable genomic
lesions that may be infrequently mutated or overlooked and
provide a new method for the prioritization of candidate
genetic mutations. Cancer Res; 76(1); 127–38. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

genomic data, our understanding of the functional signiﬁcance of these genetic events lags far behind. One major
challenge is how to sort through all of the known mutations
to ﬁnd novel therapeutic targets. To this end, we have developed an algorithm called HitWalker (1), which can prioritize
gene mutations based on functional data, detailing the underlying vulnerabilities of the leukemia cells. These functional
data are derived from a kinase inhibitor screening platform
(2). These kinase inhibitor screens are run on primary patient
samples, and then the kinase targets of the effective drugs are
calculated based on the known efﬁcacy of the drugs against
various targets (1). This study is the ﬁrst example of the
HitWalker algorithm being used to identify a novel therapeutic target, TNK2.
Tyrosine Kinase Nonreceptor 2 (TNK2) is a cytoplasmic
kinase also known as ACK1 (activated CDC42-associated
kinase; ref. 3). TNK2 is part of a family of cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinases that also includes TNK1 (3). TNK2 was originally
identiﬁed based on its binding to the cell-cycle regulator,
CDC42 (4). Together, TNK2 and CDC42 regulate cellular
attachment and migration (5).
TNK2 is composed of several functional domains, including
a sterile alpha motif (SAM) domain, a tyrosine kinase domain,
a SH3 protein–protein interaction domain, a CDC42/RACinteractive (CRIB) domain, and a region that is homologous
to the EGFR-binding domain (EBD) of Mig6 and a ubiquitin

A tremendous amount of information now exists detailing
the genetic alterations in leukemia cells. Despite this wealth of

association domain. In addition to phosphorylation in
response to EGFR signaling, TNK2 can also be activated by
other receptor tyrosine kinases (6), and phosphorylation of
the TNK2 activation loop by SRC is required for its kinase
activity (7).
Multiple mechanisms by which TNK2 contributes to solid
tumors have been documented. TNK2 mutations have been
found in renal cancer cells and also in lung, ovarian, and gastric
cancers (8, 9). TNK2 genomic ampliﬁcation has been associated
with late-stage or metastatic lung and prostate cancers (10).
Overexpression of TNK2 promoted metastasis in a mouse model
of breast cancer (10). Finally, TNK2 signaling is disrupted in
prostate (11), breast (12), and gastrointestinal (13) tumors.
TNK2 can activate several protumorigenic signaling pathways, including modulation of the prosurvival AKT signaling
pathway (14), phosphorylation of androgen receptor leading to
androgen-independent prostate cancer growth (11, 15), and
negatively regulate the tumor suppressor Wwox (16). In myeloid malignancies, speciﬁcally chronic neutrophilic leukemia
and atypical chronic myeloid leukemia, nonmutated TNK2
has been shown to be a functional target in patients with
CSF3R mutations (17). TNK2 levels increase in BaF3 cells
harboring oncogenic CSF3R mutations, which have upregulated JAK kinase and SRC signaling promoting IL3-independent
growth (17).
In this report, we ﬁnd a novel link between TNK2 mutations
and leukemia using a combination of drug screening and
deep sequencing of primary patient samples to identify novel
mutations of TNK2 that are therapeutically targetable in leukemia. These mutations are oncogenic and sensitive to previously
developed TNK2 inhibitors. In addition, we developed novel,
potent TNK2 inhibitors that exhibit greater speciﬁcity for TNK2.

Materials and Methods
Sequencing of patient samples
Genomic DNA was extracted from pellets of 5  106 puriﬁed
primary patient sample mononuclear cells using the DNeasy
Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Deep sequencing was performed
on a panel of 1,862 kinase-associated genes as previously
described (17). The mutated regions of TNK2 were veriﬁed via
Sanger sequencing (GeneWiz) and analyzed using Sequencher
and DNASTAR software. All clinical samples were obtained with
informed consent by the patients. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Boards at Oregon Health and Science
University.
HitWalker prioritization
Genomic variants were prioritized based on the HitWalker
variant prioritization for personalized functional cancer genomics
algorithm as described previously (1). Functional screening of
kinase inhibitors was performed using primary patient samples,
and dependence on speciﬁc kinases was predicted based on an
inhibitor sensitivity algorithm, as previously described (2). The
gene mutations found within each patient sample were prioritized
by HitWalker integration of mutant genes with the functionally
predicted targets.
Plasmid construction
TNK2 transcript variant 1 in pDONR was purchased from
Genecopoeia (GC-Y4392). TNK2 mutations were made using the

and mutated TNK2 were transferred into a Gateway-converted
version of pMXs-IRES-Puro (Cell Biolabs, Inc.) or MSCV-IRESGFP using a Gateway LR Clonase kit (Invitrogen). Plasmid
sequences were conﬁrmed via Sanger sequencing (Euroﬁns).
Cell culture and transfection
The human embryonic kidney, 293T17 cell line (ATCC), was
grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) medium with 10% FBS (Atlanta
Biologicals), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen),
and amphotericin B (HyClone). Murine retrovirus was created
by cotransfecting TNK2 plasmids and the EcoPac plasmid
(provided by Dr. Rick Van Etten, Tufts University, Medford,
MA) into 293T17 using FuGENE 6 (ProMega). Supernatants
were harvested 72 hours later. Ba/F3 cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 15% conditioned medium
from the WEHI cell line (a source of IL3), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin B.
Ba/F3 cytokine-independent growth assays
Ba/F3 cells were infected with murine retrovirus obtained from
293T17 cells via addition of polybrene and spinoculation at 30 C
for 90 minutes at 2,500 rpm. Infected cells were placed under
puromycin selection for 72 hours. Cells were expanded after being
washed three times and ﬁnally plated at 5  105 cells/mL in RPMI
1640 medium with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin, L-glutamine, and amphotericin B. Viable cell counts were measured
using propidium iodide exclusion with a Guava personal cell
analysis system (Millipore).
pTNK2 inhibition assay
293T cells expressing TNK2 were plated in 6-well format at a
density of 250,000 cells per well 48 hours prior to treatment. Cells
were then treated with a 100 mL of XMD8-87 or XMD16-5 at 5
mmol/L and with 9 1:1 serial dilutions down to 10 nmol/L. Two
additional samples were treated with DMSO only. Cells were then
incubated for 6 hours at 37 C. Protein extraction was accomplished by adding 300 mL of lysis buffer (complete Lysis-M EDTAfree: Roche þ complete protease inhibitors Roche þ PhosSTOP:
Roche) to cells after removing media. Plates were gently shaken
for 5 minutes at room temperature. Lysates were collected and
cleared of incompletely solubilized material by spinning for
10 minutes at maximum speed in a microcentrifuge. Samples
were prepared for SDS-PAGE using the EPage loading buffer
(Invitrogen) by diluting 10 mL of lysate with 0.3 mL b-mercaptoethanol and 3.5 mL 4 loading buffer. Samples were heated at
70 C for 10 minutes and then run on EPage 8% gels (Invitrogen).
For Western blot detection, EPage gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using the Invitrogen iBlot transfer instrument. After
transfer, blots were blocked for 45 minutes in 5% milk diluted
in TBS-T (TRIS-buffered saline containing 0.1% tween), then were

washed 3 times for 5 minutes with TBS-T. Primary antibody
(Millipore ACK1-PO-Y284 #09-142) was diluted into blocking
buffer and incubated for 2 hours at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–labeled anti-rabbit secondary was diluted into blocking buffer and incubated for 30 minutes. After 3  5
minute washes in TBS-T, Pierce SuperSignal chemiluminescent
substrate was added and imaged using a Fugi chemiluminescence
Imager.
TNK2 ELISA assay
293T cells expressing TNK2 were plated in 96-well format at a
density of 50,000 cells per well 1 day prior to inhibitor treatments. Cells were treated with TNK2 inhibitors for 6 hours,
washed in Dulbecco's Phosphate-Buffered Saline, and lysed in
ice-cold RIPA buffer (Boston Bioproducts) containing Halt
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Plates were incubated on ice for 10 to 20 minutes. Ninetysix–well ELISA plates were precoated with anti-ACK chicken
antibody overnight, then washed, and blocked in PBS with 1%
BSA. Sample from lysed cells was incubated for 2 hours at room
temperature, washed, and detected with ACK1-PO-Y284 antibody or total ACK antibody (A11; Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
for 1 hour. Plates were then washed and incubated with antiRabbit HRP (Cell Signaling Technology) and then detected
using Glo Substrate (R&D) and a Pherastar Microplate Reader
(BMG Labtech).
Kinase proﬁling
KiNativ is based on biotinylated acyl phosphates of ATP and
ADP that irreversibly react with protein kinases on conserved
lysine residues in the ATP-binding pocket. The compounds were
screened following the detailed procedures described in KiNativ
methodology (18).
Enzymatic kinase assay
Kinase targets were tested with biochemical enzymatic kinase
assays using the SelectScreen Kinase Proﬁling Service (Life
Technologies Corporation) to determine IC50 values. The compounds were assayed at 10 concentrations (3-fold serial dilutions starting from 1 mmol/L) at an ATP concentration equal
to the ATP Km,app for the assay following the detailed procedures described in the SelectScreen Customer Protocol and
assay conditions documents located at www.invitrogen.com/
kinaseproﬁling.
Inhibitor studies
Infected Ba/F3 cell lines were distributed in 96-well plates with
increasing concentrations of TNK2 inhibitors. Control lines
(parental Ba/F3s, pMX empty vector, and TNK2 wild-type–expressing) were plated in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% FBS, 15%
WEHI-conditioned medium, L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, and amphotericin B, whereas posttransformation lines were
plated in WEHI-deﬁcient media. Cells were plated at a density of 6
 104 cells/mL and treated with the following inhibitors for 72
hours: dasatinib (SellekChem), AIM-100 (CalBiochem; ref. 19),
XMD8-87, and XMD16-5. All conditions were plated with three
replicates. Cell viability was measured using a methanethiosulfonate (MTS)-based assay (CellTiter96 Aqueous One Solution;
Promega), and absorbance (490 nm) was read at 1 and 3 hours
after adding reagent, using a BioTek Synergy 2 plate reader. MTS

absorbances of inhibitor-treated wells were normalized to those
of untreated cells. Regression curve ﬁt analysis of the normalized
data to determine IC50 values was performed using GraphPad
Prism software.
Immunoblotting
Transfected 293T17 cells were treated with cell lysis buffer (Cell
Signaling Technologies) with added complete mini protease
inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche), phenylmethylsulfonyl ﬂuoride, and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail 2 (Sigma-Aldrich).
Lysates were spun at 8,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C to pellet
cell debris, mixed 2:1 with 3 GS sample buffer with b-ME [75
mmol/L Tris (pH 6.8), 3% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 15% glycerol,
8% b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue], and heated
at 95 C for 5 minutes. Lysates were run on criterion 4% to 15%
Tris-HCl gradient gels (Bio-Rad), transferred to a polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride membrane, and blocked for 30 minutes in TBS-T with
5% BSA. Blots were probed overnight at 4 C with anti-ACK1
(TNK2) rabbit antibody (Abcam; catalog no. ab65108), antiACK1 Phospho Y284 rabbit antibody (Abcam; ab74091), antiACK N-terminal antibody (Abcam; ab137506), anti-actin mouse
antibody (Millipore), followed by anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG
HRP conjugate secondary antibodies. Blots were developed using
Clarity chemiluminescent substrate (Bio-Rad) or SuperSignal
West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Life Technologies)
and imaged using a Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP Imaging System or
exposed to X-ray ﬁlm.

Results
Functional genomic prioritization identiﬁes TNK2 as an
important target in a patient with acute myelogenous leukemia
In order to identify the actionable genetic drivers in a patient
with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML; 10-514), we utilized
functional inhibitor screen data to prioritize genomic mutations found by sequencing of 1,862 kinase-associated genes.
The functional data were obtained by screening the primary
patient sample against a panel of small-molecules composed
largely of kinase inhibitors. An IC50 value was then calculated
for each inhibitor and compared with the median of the IC50s
for the full patient sample cohort that has been screened to
date. Inhibitors for which the IC50 value was less than 20% of
the cohort median were considered effective. As an example,
the cohort median IC50 observed for dasatinib to date has been
109 nmol/L, and in comparison, the two specimens analyzed
for this study exhibited signiﬁcantly lower IC50s of 6.8 and
22.6 nmol/L (Fig. 1A) The full list of effective drugs was used
to predict speciﬁc kinase targets that were important for mediating the observed drug sensitivity proﬁle, using a previously
described algorithm (2). These functional targets were then
integrated with mutant genes observed within this same specimen using the previously described HitWalker algorithm,
which annotates functional and genomic targets onto the
STRING database of protein–protein interaction networks to
calculate the shortest path between mutated genes to functional
gene targets (1). In this way, we prioritized mutant genes that
were likely to explain the drug sensitivity pattern observed for
AML patient specimen 10-514 (Fig. 1B). In this specimen, two
genes were both highly ranked functional targets and were
themselves mutated genes—the tyrosine kinases EPHA8 and
TNK2 (Figs. 1B and 2A and B).

Prioritized TNK2 mutations are highly oncogenic
To determine whether or not the prioritized mutations were
oncogenic, we tested them in a cytokine-independent growth
assay. The murine pro-B Ba/F3 cell line normally requires the
cytokine IL3 for growth, but can grow in the absence of IL3 if a
transforming oncogene is expressed. To test the oncogenic capacity of the EPHA8 and TNK2 mutations, we introduced wild-type
and mutant versions of EPHA8 and TNK2 into Ba/F3 cells and
withdrew IL3. The EPHA8 mutation exhibited no transforming
capacity in this assay (data not shown), whereas the TNK2
D163E mutation allowed the cells to grow in the absence of IL3
(Fig. 2C). Based on the oncogenic capacity of this novel TNK2
mutation, we looked for other patient samples in which a TNK2

130 Cancer Res; 76(1) January 1, 2016

mutation had been highly ranked by HitWalker. In a chronic
myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) patient sample (10-210), a
TNK2 R806Q mutation was also highly prioritized (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Fig. 2A and B). This mutation also transformed Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. The
D163E mutation occurs in the tyrosine kinase domain of TNK2,
while that R806Q mutation is in the EBD of TNK2 (Fig. 2A).
Analysis of these TNK2 mutations by Western blot revealed that
the TNK2 D163E mutation results in increased phosphorylation of TNK2, whereas the R806Q mutation does not. This
suggests that the D163E mutation may increase kinase activity
of TNK2, whereas the R806Q mutation may lead to increased
signaling through alternative mechanisms.

Figure 2.
Prioritized TNK2 mutations exhibit transformative capacity and confer dasatinib sensitivity. A, schematic of TNK2 gene and locations of mutations of interest.
The D163E mutation was found in a patient with AML, and the R806Q mutation was found in a patient with CMML. The SAM, tyrosine kinase domain, SRC
homology 3 domain (SH3, a protein–protein interaction domain), CDC42/Rac-interactive binding domain (CRIB), SRC, MHR (aka the EBD), and UBA are shown.
The amino acid position of each domain is noted above (40). B, conﬁrmation of TNK2 mutations found by deep sequencing. Sanger sequencing was
performed on genomic DNA isolated from patient leukemia samples and identiﬁed heterozygous D163E and R806Q mutations in patient samples. Electropherogram
peaks are shown and correspond to the following nucleotides: A (green), T (red), C (blue), and G (black). C, IL3-dependent Ba/F3 cells were infected with
murine retrovirus expressing mutated TNK2 constructs. TNK2 wild-type and empty vector expressing Ba/F3s in addition to uninfected parental Ba/F3 cells
were used as controls. Both TNK2 mutations transformed cells to IL3-independent growth. D, the TNK2 D163E mutation is hyperphosphorylated. 293T17 cells
expressing TNK2 D163E and R806Q mutations were subjected to immunoblot analysis for TNK2, TNK2 pY284, and actin. Parental 293T17 cells as well as empty vector
and TNK2 wild-type–expressing cells were included as controls. E, Ba/F3 cells before and after IL3-independent transformation were treated with varying
concentrations of dasatinib. Both posttransformation lines were sensitive to dasatinib at low nanomolar concentrations. The pre-IL3 transformation cell lines
did not show sensitivity to dasatinib.

Structural consequences of the D163E and R806Q mutations
From a structural perspective, the two activating mutations of
TNK2, D163E and R806Q, are rather conservative and do not
drastically change the electrostatic properties of the TNK2 domain
in which they are located. Based on available structural data, we
tried to infer a possible mechanism as to how the mutants could

inﬂuence kinase activity. For TNK2, structural data are available
for the kinase domain in its active conformation (in the presence
and absence of ATP-pocket ligands) as well as in its inactive
conformation as part of a kinase–SH3 domain construct. Based
on these structural studies, homodimerization has been proposed
to allosterically activate TNK2 kinase activity similar to EGFR (20).

The latter forms an asymmetric head-to-tail dimer, with the Nlobe of one molecule interacting with the C-lobe of the second
molecule (21). Another example of kinase domain dimerization
is BRAF that forms a symmetric side-to-side dimer involving
primarily residues of the N-lobe (22). In contrast with EGFR and
BRAF, the structures of the TNK2-active state show a head-to-head
symmetric dimer involving residues in proximity to the catalytically active aC-helix in the N-lobe (20).
One of the two activating mutations, the D163E, resides in
the N-lobe of the kinase domain, and therefore existing structural data could be used to build a hypothesis explaining the
activating effect of the D to E mutation. The D163 residue is
located in the loop connecting the b3 strand with the aC-helix
(Fig. 3A). This loop is not present in some of the structures
deposited in the PDB database, which might reﬂect a certain
degree of ﬂexibility. Nonetheless, Protein Data Bank entry 4ewh
presents the active state of the kinase, including this loop region
(23), in which the side chain of D163 is solvent exposed and
may be involved in the dimerization interface (Fig. 3A). In the
interface, however, no potentially interacting residue, which
would engage the aspartate carboxyl group in either an ionic
interaction (Lys/Arg) or a hydrogen bond (Ser/Thr), could be
found in the near proximity (<5Å).
In a different approach, comparison of the active and inactive
conformation of the TNK2 kinase domain reveals the classical
rearrangements within the N-lobe (Fig. 3B; refs. 20, 23). Specifically, in the inactive state, the aC-helix undergoes an outward
movement, and also the N-terminal b-sheet is repositioned. These
conformational changes also inﬂuence the position and orientation of the b3-aC loop that hosts the D163 residue. While in the
active conformation, the side chain of D163 points to the outside,
it is buried between the C-terminal b-sheet and the aC-helix of the
N-lobe in the inactive conformation (Fig. 3B). Similar to the active
state situation, there is no functional group in proximity of 5Å of

D163 that would lock the residue in this position in the inactive
state (Fig. 3C). However, one could well imagine that upon a
D163E mutation, the longer and thus bulkier glutamate side
chain causes steric clashes within the core of the N-lobe (Fig.
3D). As a consequence, the b3-aC loop would undergo a conformational switch to a more outward-oriented position of the
D163E residue, thereby stabilizing the aC-helix in the active
conformation.
A closer look at the sequence of this region of TNK1 and
TNK2 across different species reveals additional interesting
observations strengthening our above made hypothesis. While
in TNK2, the KPD(161-163) segment in the b3-aC loop is only
conserved in mouse and human, TNK1 possesses a Glu at
position of D163. This glutamate, however, is either accommodated in a longer b3-aC loop or preceded by less bulky
residues, such as glycine. Furthermore, in other cytoplasmic
tyrosine kinases, this motif in the b3-aC loop is often composed of a KP[S/G] sequence that is also less bulky as compared
with KP[D/E].
The importance of this b3-aC loop for the regulation of kinase
activity is further corroborated by reports about other tyrosine
kinases whose activity was inﬂuenced upon mutations in this
region of the kinase domain. For example, targeted mutations in
this region of SRC have shown to be activating (24, 25), whereas
alanine scanning in this loop of CSK has led to a loss of kinase
activity due to disruption of the kinase–SH2 interface (25, 26).
Also for ABL kinase mutation of residue, E275 has been shown to
inﬂuence kinase activity (27).
In contrast with D163, the second mutation R806Q lies in a
region of TNK2 that is structurally undeﬁned. Based on the
primary sequence, this region has been identiﬁed as the EBD
also known as MIG6 homology region (MHR). Secondary structure prediction by PsiPred (http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/psipred/)
indicates that this region is very likely to be unfolded. As the

D163 into a glutamate prolongs the
side chain by a methylene group that
in the inactive conformation cannot
easily be accommodated in this
inward-oriented position due to the
proximity to P199 and M201.

name implies and further shown by sequence alignments, this
stretch of TNK2 possesses high sequence identity to be a part of the
MIG6 protein that regulates EGFR kinase activity upon interaction
with its kinase domain (Supplementary Fig. S2). Structural studies
on a complex between EGFR and a MIG6 peptide have been
published by Kuriyan and colleagues (28). MIG6 binds to the Clobe of the kinase domain with one segment and likely extends
toward the kinase-active site with a segment C-terminal to the
ﬁrst one leading to kinase inhibition. Within the same publication, the authors also speculate on a possible function of the
EBD of TNK2 (28). Not only the EBD is highly homologous to
MIG6 but also the C-lobes of the kinase domains of EGFR and
TNK2 are very similar. This led to the hypothesis that the EBD
of TNK2 could play a role in an autoinhibition mechanism of
TNK2. The R806Q mutation lies in the segment of the EBD that
would by homology bind to the C-lobe of the kinase (Fig. 2),
and this interaction is required as a docking interaction so that
the second segment can be engaged in further interactions with
either the activation loop or residues from the N-lobe of the
kinase. If now this mutation weakens the binding to the kinase
C-lobe, the autoinhibition of TNK2 would be lost, resulting in
an active kinase.
TNK2 mutations confer dasatinib sensitivity
In the TNK2-mutant leukemia samples, TNK2 was prioritized
partly due to sensitivity of these samples to the multikinase

Novel TNK2 inhibitors
Despite dasatinib's ability to potently inhibit TNK2, its promiscuity as a kinase inhibitor (30) makes it difﬁcult to conclude
that its cellular potency is derived primarily from TNK2 inhibition. Therefore, we sought to identify structurally distinct TNK2
inhibitors with improved kinase selectivity that could serve as
more precise mechanistic probes. We searched our in-house
database for inhibitors that exhibited potent and selective binding
to TNK2, which resulted in the identiﬁcation of XMD8-87 (31)
and XMD16-5 (Fig. 4A; ref. 32). The kinase selectivities of these
two compounds were evaluated by screening against a diverse
panel of 241 kinases using a chemical proteomic approach,
KiNativ (Fig. 4B; ref. 33). The selectivity of XMD8-87 was also

inhibitor dasatinib (Fig. 1A). Dasatinib has been shown to
exhibit binding to TNK2 in the low nanomolar range (29),
suggesting that dasatinib sensitivity in these cases could be
mediated through targeting of TNK2. To test whether the TNK2
mutations directly confer sensitivity to dasatinib, we treated the
Ba/F3 cell lines expressing the TNK2 mutants with dasatinib
and evaluated effects on cell growth and viability. Control or
mutant cell lines grown in IL3 were completely insensitive to
dasatinib, because the cytokine support renders their survival
independent of TNK2. In contrast, both TNK2-mutant cell lines
growing in the absence of IL3 were highly sensitive to dasatinib
with IC50s of less than 10 nmol/L.

Kinase Inhibitors Targeting Novel TNK2 Mutations in Leukemia

assessed using KinomeScan (Ambit Biosciences; ref. 29) across a
panel of 402 human kinases at concentration of 10 mmol/L (see
supporting information for complete proﬁling data). The top hits
from both screening tests (kinases exhibit binding inhibition of
80% or more in Kinativ or 90% or more in KinomeScan) were
further investigated by an enzymatic kinase assay (SelectScreen
Kinase Proﬁling Services; Supplementary Table S1). This analysis
revealed that both of these compounds are much more selective
inhibitors of TNK2 than dasatinib. Activity of XMD8-87 and
XMD16-5 against TNK2 was conﬁrmed by ELISA (Fig. 4C). To
conﬁrm that these compounds could inhibit TNK2 in a cellular
context, we evaluated their ability to inhibit TNK2 autophosphorylation by immunoblot analysis in 293T cells (Fig. 4D). Both
compounds were found to be potent in the inhibition of TNK2
phosphorylation.
Selective TNK2 inhibitors potently block proliferation of TNK2mutant cell lines
Dasatinib is a potent multikinase inhibitor and has many
targets other than TNK2, such as ABL and SRC kinases. As such,
we next wanted to test whether inhibitors with greater speciﬁcity to TNK2 are also effective against Ba/F3 cells that are
dependent on mutant TNK2. In addition to XMD8-87 and
XMD16-5, we also evaluated a structurally distinct third previously reported TNK2 inhibitor, AIM-100 (15). All three of the
inhibitors exhibited potent inhibition of growth of the TNK2
mutant expressing cell lines while having little or no effect on
the control cells out to the highest tested concentrations (1,000
nmol/L; Fig. 4B–D). The compound XMD8-87 had IC50s of 38
nmol/L and 113 nmol/L for the D163E and R806Q mutations

Mutations of gatekeeper residue inhibit drug sensitivity
In order to conﬁrm that the death of cells harboring TNK2
mutations was speciﬁcally due to inhibition of TNK2, we
designed potentially inhibitor-resistant alleles by mutating the
"gatekeeper" threonine (T205) to a methionine (T205M) or
an isoleucine (T205I). This residue was selected for mutation,
as it is well characterized as a hot-spot that can confer resistance
in many of the therapeutically important kinases, such as BCRABL, c-KIT, PDGFR, and EGFR (34–37). In addition, from
crystallography and molecular modeling, dasatinib, XMD887, and XMD16-5 are all predicted to engage in hydrogen
bonding interaction with the hydroxyl of T205. We engineered
these gatekeeper mutations in the context of the most potent
oncogene of the TNK2 mutations, D163E. We then generated
IL3-independent Ba/F3 lines and tested the cell lines for sensitivity to dasatinib, AIM-100, XMD8-87, and XMD16-5 (Fig. 5).
The gatekeeper mutations conferred near-complete resistance
of the D163E-mutant cell lines to all of the compounds tested,
indicating that the effects of these inhibitors on TNK2 cell lines
are largely due to on-target effects on TNK2. It is important to
note, however, that the gatekeeper mutations are in and of
themselves activating, and thus increased growth rate of the
cells could affect drug sensitivity.

TNK2 mutations in other tumor types are sensitive to the novel
TNK2 inhibitors
Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas data using cBioPortal
(38) revealed that many tumor types harbor TNK2 mutations. Of
particular interest were several recurrent truncation mutations
found in TNK2. Because these truncation mutations resulted
in complete or partial loss of the portion of TNK2 that is
homologous to MIG6, which in addition to binding EGFR also
participates in negative regulation of the kinase domain, we
hypothesized that they could be activating. We generated four
of these truncation mutations: P494fs [found in several cell lines
in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE); ref. 39], P632fs
(CCLE, glioblastoma, pancreatic, and stomach cancers), S808
(bladder cancer), and Q831fs (stomach cancer; Fig. 7A). Of
particular interest, the S808 and Q831fs mutations were
markedly overexpressed when expressed in 293T17 cells (Fig.
7B), with a corresponding increase in phosphorylation (Fig. 7C).
To determine whether autophosphorylation of these overexpressed TNK2 mutants could be blocked with TNK2 inhibitors,
we treated the cells with dasatinib, XMD8-87, or XMD16-5 and
indeed found that the vast majority of phosphorylation was
blocked. These data suggest that these novel TNK2 inhibitors

In this study, we have identiﬁed two oncogenic mutations in
TNK2 from leukemia patient samples using the HitWalker algorithm, which uses functional data to prioritize mutations that may
be functionally relevant in the patient sample. This method
allowed us to rapidly prioritize TNK2 as a novel therapeutic target
in leukemia. It also has the advantage of allowing for the identiﬁcation of mutations that are of functional importance, but may
be overlooked due to their rarity in genomic data alone. The ﬁrst
mutation, D163E, is located in the tyrosine kinase domain of
TNK2. A previous report also identiﬁed a mutation in the kinase
domain (E346K) from a patient with ovarian endometroid carcinoma (9). The E346K mutation had the highest levels of
phosphorylation at tyrosine 284, of all the mutations screened
in that study (9). This is consistent with our ﬁnding that the
D163E mutant, also in the kinase domain, results in high levels of
TNK2 phosphorylation (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, although the
D163E and E346K mutations are in different lobes of the kinase

Kinase Inhibitors Targeting Novel TNK2 Mutations in Leukemia

domain, they result in similar phenotypes. Molecular modeling
suggests that although a fairly conservative substitution, the
D163E mutation may stabilize the aC-helix of the N-lobe in an
active conformation (Fig. 3).
The second mutation is present in the Mig6 homology domain
(MHC, aka EBD) of TNK2. This mutation, R806Q, is very close to a
synthetic mutation F820A designed to block interaction of the
MHD with the kinase domain (9). This interaction of the kinase
domain with the MHD is thought to inhibit the kinase activity of
TNK2 (9). Interestingly, the F820A mutation was hyperphosphorylated (9), whereas the R806Q mutation is not (Fig. 2D),
suggesting that different regions of the MHD may have different
functional importance. The R806Q mutation resides within a
segment that is highly homologous to the C-lobe–binding peptide of Mig6, and therefore may be involved in kinase autoinhibition. In summary, based on TNK2 kinase domain structures as
well as sequence alignments and homology, it is possible to derive
hypotheses giving a possible explanation for the two activating
mutations in this kinase. To further elucidate the molecular
mechanism of kinase activation and a possible autoinhibition
mechanism of the MHD domain, further experimental evidence is
needed.
Mutated TNK2 may also represent a therapeutic target in other
malignancies. In this study, we identiﬁed two truncation mutations found in solid tumors that led to receptor overexpression
and a correspondingly high level of phosphorylation (Fig. 7).
Interestingly, these two mutations both lead to a loss of a portion
of the MHD, which may negatively regulate kinase activity, but
also a loss of the ubiquitin association domain (UBD; Fig. 7A).
The UBD is the region that interacts with ubiquitin ligases, leading
to protein degradation and turnover, and therefore the loss of the
UBD could contribute to protein overexpression (40).
Dasatinib is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor initially developed
against ABL and SRC kinases (30). Dasatinib sensitivity in samples from patients with TNK2 mutations (Fig. 1B) could result
from either direct inhibition of TNK2 kinase activity itself or
indirectly through inhibition of SRC kinases by dasatinib, because
SRC can activate TNK2 by directly phosphorylating the TNK2
activation loop (7). Alternatively, any number of other targets of
dasatinib could be relevant. Dasatinib has been shown to exhibit
low nanomolar binding afﬁnity for both TNK2 and SRC with Kds
of 5.6 and 0.5 nmol/L, respectively (30). Other TNK2 inhibitors,
such as AIM-100, have been shown to be effective in cell culture
models of prostate cancer (15).
In this study, we newly describe two kinase inhibitors that
exhibit greater selectivity for TNK2 compared with dasatinib.
XMD8-87 in particular demonstrated a high degree of selectivity
for TNK2 (Fig. 4B) and is also more potent than the previously
reported TNK2 inhibitor, AIM-100 (Fig. 4). Furthermore, XMD887 and XMD16-5 potently inhibit phosphorylation of TNK2
truncation mutations found in solid tumor types (Fig. 7C). These
compounds represent promising new lead chemical candidates
for further development of clinically applicable, selective TNK2
inhibitors across multiple tumor types.
Here, we prioritized TNK2 mutations as important functional
targets using the HitWalker algorithm (1). This highlights the

utility of the HitWalker algorithm in identifying actionable genomic lesions, including those that are infrequently mutated and
may otherwise be overlooked in the analysis of genomic data
alone. It is important to note that other genes not sequenced as
part of the panel of kinase-associated genes used in this study
could also contribute to the kinase sensitivity observed in these
samples, and it will therefore be important in the future to
perform a more comprehensive genomic analysis through
whole-exome sequencing. Given the large number of mutations
present in a wide variety of tumors, the ability to prioritize genetic
lesions greatly reduces the time and resources necessary to validate
candidate mutations. Furthermore, this study highlights the utility of drug screening data for understanding the underlying
vulnerabilities of leukemia cells and their accompanying gene
mutations.
