ABSTRACT
Intrinsic apoptosis eliminates cells with damaged DNA and cells with dysregulated
expression of oncogene. PGAM5, a member of the phosphoglycerate mutase family,
has two splicing variants: PGAM5L (the long form) and PGAM5S (the short form).
It has been well established that PGAM5 is at the convergent point of multiple necrosis
pathways. However, the role of PGAM5 in intrinsic apoptosis is still controversial.
Here we report that the PGAM5L, but not PGAM5S is a prerequisite for the activation
of Bax and dephosphorylation of Drp1 in arenobufagin and staurosporine induced
intrinsic apoptosis. Knockdown of PGAM5L inhibits the translocation of Bax to the
mitochondria and reduces mitochondrial fission. The interaction between PGAM5L and
Drp1 was observed in both arenobufagin and staurosporine treated HCT116 cells, but
not in HCT116 Bax−/− cells. Bax transfection rescues the formation of the triplex in
both arenobufagin and staurosporine stimulated HCT116 Bax−/− cells. Arenobufagin
shows remarkable anti-cancer effects both in orthotropic and heterotropic CRC models
and demonstrates less toxic effects as compared with that of cisplatin. Bax-PGAM5LDrp1 complex is detected in arenobufagin and staurosporine treated CRC cells in vitro
and in arenobufagin and cisplatin treated tumor in vivo as well. In summary, our
results demonstrate that Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1 complex is required for intrinsic apoptosis
execution.

in the intrinsic necrosis pathway, based on the evidence
that PGAM5 knockdown attenuates ROS- and calcium
ionophore induced necrotic death [3]. The “mitochondria
attack complex” consisting of PGAM5 and Drp-1 is
formed during the execution of necrosis [4]. However,
the role of PGAM5 in apoptosis is still controversial.
Staurosporine-induced apoptotic death is not affected by
PGAM5 knockdown.
Upon apoptotic stimuli, Bax, Bak, and possibly
other unidentified proteins are relocated into the
mitochondrial outer membrane and oligomerized to form
the mitochondrial apoptosis-induced channel to release
cyto C [5]. Arenobufagin [6] and staurosporine [7, 8]

INTRODUCTION
Cancer is a major public health problem which
accounts for 1/4 deaths in the United States [1]. Apoptosis
resistance is a strategy of choice for cancer cells that employ
multiple mechanisms to override apoptosis for survival [2].
Understanding and tweaking the mechanisms of apoptosis
are pivotal to eliminate potentially malignant cells.
PGAM5, a member of the phosphoglycerate
mutase family, is a Kelch-like ECH-associated protein
1 (Keap1)-binding protein. PGAM5 has two splicing
forms, the shorter form (PGAM5S) and the longer
isoform (PGAM5L). Both isoforms of PGAM5 function

have been reported to induce apoptosis in different cell
lines through activation of Bax. Thus we want to examine
if PGAM5 is necessary in Bax mediated apoptosis. Our
results identify a multiprotein complex including PGAM5,
Bax and Drp1 that specifically formed during intrinsic
apoptosis induction.

and accumulation of Bax and Drp1 in the mitochondria
were observed in HCT116 WT cells (Figure 2A). Dimers
were formed when cells were treated with arenobufagin
(Figure 2B). Given the robust MOMP activity of Bax
activation, we therefore assayed its ability to release
soluble pro-apoptotic factors liked cyto C and non-soluble
factors, such as apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) that
tethered to the outer surface of the inner mitochondrial
membrane (IMM) [5]. Release of cyto C into cytosol
(Figure 2A) and translocation of AIF from mitochondria to
nucleus were observed in HCT116 WT cells (Figure 2C).
The role of Bax in arenobufagin induced apoptosis
was further confirmed with HCT116 WT and HCT116
Bax−/− cells. Arenobufagin significantly increased the
apoptosis rate and decreased the cell viability in HCT116
WT cells compared with that of HCT116 Bax−/− cells in
a dose dependent manner. The increased apoptosis and
decreased viability could be partly reversed by iMAC2,
a potential inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis-induced
channel (Figure 2D–2E) [11]. Cleavage of PARP and
caspase-3 were observed in HCT116 WT cells accompanied
by Bax activation (Figure 2F). JC-1 is a reliable fluorescent
probe to assess ∆Ψm [12]. The concentration-dependent
shift in the emission spectrum from red to green measured
by flow cytometry indicated the dissipation of ∆Ψm by
arenobufagin in SW480 and DLD-1 cells (Supplementary
Figure S2B and Supplementary Figure S2D). The lowered
∆Ψm by arenobufagin was significantly reversed in HCT116
Bax−/− cells (Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D).
Immunofluorescent staining provided direct
evidences that arenobufagin drived AIF shifting to the
nucleus with Bax punctae in the mitochondria (Figure 2G).
It has been shown that both MOMP and proteolytic
cleavage of mature AIF from its IMM-embedded
N-terminus were prerequisites for AIF release [13].
This suggested that not only arenobufagin has a strong
permeabilization effect on mitochondrial membranes,
but also has efficient effect in disrupting the inner
mitochondrial membrane integrity [5]. According to
the Nomenclature Committee on Cell Death [14], the
dissipation of Ψm, the loss of cyto C from mitochondria
and translocation of AIF to the nuclear, suggest that the
cell death induced by arenobufagin can be defined as
intrinsic apoptosis, which is highly dependent on Bax
activation.

RESULTS
Arenobufagin induces tumor cell apoptosis
To address the role of arenobufagin on cell viability,
various CRC cell lines, including SW480, DLD-1 and
LS174T, were tested. Arenobufagin decreased cell
viability both in a dose - and time - dependent manner
(Figure 1A–1B). Arenobufagin also lowered the cell
viability in HeLa (human cervical cancer cell line), A549
(human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line), MCF-7
(human breast adenocarcinoma cell line), and even in taxol
resistant MCF-7/taxol cell line (Supplementary Figure
S1C). We then examined which cell death subroutine was
responsible for the lowered viability. Rounding-up of the
cells, retraction of pseudopodes, reduction of cellular and
nuclear volume (pyknosis) and nuclear fragmentation
(karyorrhexis) in arenobufagin treated SW480 cells suggested
the morphological features of apoptosis [9] (Supplementary
Figure S1B). Hoechst 33342 staining (Supplementary Figure
S1A), annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D double staining
(Figure 1C and Supplementary Figure S1D) showed that most
of the cell death induced by arenobufagin can be classified as
apoptosis in SW480, DLD-1, Hela, and A549.
Activation of caspases is a biochemical feature
of apoptosis [9]. Immunoblotting assessment showed
that caspase 9 was cleaved by arenobufagin. Activated
caspase-9 in turn cleaves and activates caspase-3.
The cleaved caspase 9 and caspase 3 were increased
by arenobufagin in a dose-dependent manner. The
cleavage of poly (ADP) ribose polymerase (PARP),
a caspase-3/7 substrate [10], was also increased by
arenobufagin treatment (Figure 1D). The apoptosis
caused by arenobufagin was efficiently abrogated by
pretreatment with N-benzyloxycarbonyl -Val-Ala-Aspfluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk), a broad spectrum
caspase inhibitor, suggesting that arenobufagin induced
cell death was caspase-dependent [9]. The viabilities were
subsequently recovered as showed in Figure 1E. These
morphological and biochemical changes suggest that the
cell death caused by arenobufagin is apoptosis.

PGAM5L is required for Bax-mediated intrinsic
apoptosis
The mitochondrial PGAM5 is at the convergent
point of multiple necrosis pathways. Two splicing forms
of PGAM5 are identical from amino acid 1–239, with the
shorter form (PGAM5S) containing 16 additional C-terminal
amino acids and the longer isoform (PGAM5L) containing
50 additional C-terminal amino acids. It should be noted that

the two variants of PGAM5 carry out different functions
during necrosis execution [3]. PGAM5S is more hydrophobic
than PGAM5L. PGAM5S was only observed in the 1%
SDS-soluble fraction (the Triton X-100 insoluble pellet
with a buffer containing 1% SDS). Therefore, PGAM5S
was not found in the whole-cell extraction (WCE) buffer
but only with PGAM5L (containing 1% Triton X-100) [3].
To further confirm the discrepancy between PGAM5L and
PGAM5S, His-tagged PGAM5S and Flag-tagged PGAM5L
coding sequence were constructed and transfected into
SW480 cells. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3B, His
and Flag expressed only in the buffer of SDS-soluble and
WCE respectively which were demonstrated by incubating
with anti-His, anti-Flag, anti-PGAM5, and anti-vimentin
antibodies. These results indicated that PGAM5S only
presented in the 1% SDS-soluble fraction, and PGAM5L
only presented in WCE buffer. The finding that PGAM5L and
PGAM5S are in different extraction allowed us to dissect the
roles of these two splice forms in apoptosis. Supplementary
Figure S3C showed the specific knockdown efficacy of
PGAM5L and PGAM5S isoforms by western blot. We
then examined their role in arenobufagin induced intrinsic
apoptosis. The apoptosis rate was significantly decreased in
SW480 cells infected with lentivirus carrying short hairpin
RNA (shRNA) of PGAM5L, but not of PGAM5S (Figure
3A, Supplementary Figure S3A) [3]. The reduced apoptosis
in HCT116 cells stably transduced with lentivirus carrying
shRNA of PGAM5L, but not of PGAM5S, further confirmed
our results (Figure 3B). However, the apoptosis rate was
less than 5% in arenobufagin treated HCT116 Bax−/− cells
stably expressing PGAM5L or PGAM5S shRNA (Figure
3C). Accordingly, the viability was elevated in SW480 cells
infected with PGAM5L shRNA or in HCT116 PGAM5L
shRNA stable cells, but not in PGAM5L shRNA HCT116
Bax−/− cells treated with arenobufagin (Supplementary Figure
S3D–S3F).
The cleavage of PARP was observed in PGAM5L
shRNA transfected HCT116 cells, but not in HCT116
Bax−/− cells (Figure 3D). We asked if PGAM5L is needed
in the translocation of Bax. The overlap between mitotracker (green) and Bax staining (red) which showed
yellow fluorescence (merge) indicates that arenobufagin
induced relocation of Bax to mitochondria in SW480
cells. PGAM5L-KD, but not PGAM5S -KD, inhibited the
translocation of Bax induced by arenobufagin (Figure 3E).
Taken together, our findings demonstrate that PGAM5L
is required for arenobufagin induced intrinsic apoptosis
mediated through Bax translocation to mitochondria.

recovered the viability in both cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S4B–S4C). Cell viability and apoptosis rate
were not affected in HCT116 Bax−/− cells with or
without arenobufagin treatment, nor are they affected
by PGAM5L siRNA or PGAM5S siRNA (Figure 4C,
Supplementary Figure S4D).
The lowered expression of Drp1 by arenobufagin
together with its activation of Bax were interfered
by PGAM5L siRNA, but not by PGAM5S siRNA
(Figure 3D). Immunofluorescence staining showed that
the accumulation of Bax in mitochondria induced by
arenobufagin was severely disrupted by Drp1 siRNA or
mdivi-1 in SW480 cells (Figure 4D). Drp1 was reported
to facilitate the membrane fission via constricting and
severing the mitochondrial membrane through a GTPdependent mechanism [16]. It is required for cytochrome
C release and consequent activation of caspases during
apoptosis [17]. We then checked the expression of Drp1 in
CRC patient tissues and tissue microarrays. The expression
of Drp1 in tumor was significantly stronger than that in
tumor adjacent tissues and normal tissues (Supplementary
Figure S4E). Microarray analysis further confirmed the
above results that the expressions of Drp1 in malignant
and adjacent tissues were higher than that of normal colon
and normal lymphoid tissues (Supplementary Figure S4F,
sample A–G). Thus, together our data suggest that Drp1
is an inseparable partner of PGAM5L in the induction of
intrinsic apoptosis with Bax activation. Targeting Drp1mediated mitochondrial fission might be an effective
approach for treating cancer [18].
Downregulation of Drp1 inhibits fragmentation
of the mitochondrial network and partially prevents the
release of cyto C [19]. Mdivi-1 prevents mitochondria
division and Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization during apoptosis [20]. We quantified
PGAM5 and Drp1 mediated mitochondrial morphological
changes using a recently developed software, Micro-P
[21]. The number of small fragmented mitochondria
(type 1) was significantly increased and the number of
normal mitochondria was decreased in cell treated with
arenobufagin (Figure 5A–5B). PGAM5L siRNA, but
not PGAM5S siRNA alleviated the increasing of type 1
mitochondria induced by arenobufagin (Figure 5C). Drp1
siRNA and Mdivi-1 treatment displayed a significantly
higher percentage of type 5 mitochondrion, with a
concomitant decrease in type 2 (Figure 5D). Electron
microscope images showed that the increased small
fragmented mitochondria were significantly reduced by
PGAM5L shRNA (Figure 5E). These results suggested
that interaction between PGAM5L and Drp1 is linked to
mitochondria fission.

Drp1 is also needed in the induction of intrinsic
apoptosis process
Drp1 siRNA or Drp1 inhibitor mdivi-1 [15]
significantly inhibited arenobufagin induced apoptosis
in SW480 and HCT116 WT cells (Figure 4A–4B,
Supplementary Figure S4A). Accordingly, Drp1 siRNA

activation of Drp1 would lead to mitochondrial
dysfunction and cell necrosis [4]. To determine if the
specific association between Drp1 and PGAM5 is
required for the induction of intrinsic apoptosis, coimmunoprecipitation was performed in HCT116 WT and
HCT116 Bax−/− cells. As shown in Figure 6A, a strong
interaction between Bax, Drp1 and PGAM5 was found
in HCT116 WT under apoptotic condition when proteins
were immunoprecipitated with PGAM5 antibody. The
interaction was completely abolished in HCT116 Bax−/−
cells under both normal and apoptotic conditions. To
further confirm the results, we tried to rescue apoptosis
by transfecting a HA-tagged Bax coding sequence into
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HCT116 Bax−/− cells. As expected, the interaction between
Bax, Drp1 and PGAM5 was restored. Also, iMAC2, a
potential inhibitor of mitochondrial apoptosis-induced
channel [11], attenuated the interaction between Drp1
and PGAM5 in apoptotic HCT116 WT cells (Figure 6B).
These results suggest that a Drp1-PGAM5 complex is
formed in a Bax dependent manner.
Recent study demonstrated that mitochondrial
fragmentation facilitates Bax insertion and activation
in mitochondria, resulting in the release of apoptogenic
factors, such as cyto C. Drp1 inhibition blocks Bax
insertion and activation in mitochondrial membrane
[22]. As shown in Figure 6C, PGAM5L shRNA, but

not PGAM5S shRNA, almost completely abolished the
interaction between Drp1 and Bax. When PGAM5L
expression was restored, the interaction was re-established.
The interaction between PGAM5, Drp1 and Bax
was confirmed in SW480, Hela and A549 cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S1E). The immunoprecipitated
Bax and PGAM5 increased in a time dependent manner
as baited with Drp1 under arenobufagin treatment in
SW480 (Figure 6D). The dephosphorylation of Drp1 and
Bax at early time points after arenobufagin exposure was
explored that dephosphorylation of Drp1 Ser637 was
observed in the first 1, 2, 4, 6 hours and the strongest
interaction between Drp1 and Bax was observed after 2
hrs treatment (Figure 6E).
A time dependent dephosphorylation of Drp1 Ser637
was observed in arenobufagin treated HCT116 WT cells,
but not in HCT116 Bax−/− cells. The dephosphorylation of
Drp1 Ser637 was positively correlated with the expression
of Bax (Figure 6F–6G).
These results further strengthen our results that Bax
activation and Drp1 dephosphorylation are indispensable
for the formation of the Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1 complex in
the process of intrinsic apoptosis.

showed that the apoptosis rates in HCT116 WT cells
were significantly higher than that of HCT116 Bax−/−
cells, suggesting that staurosporine induced apoptosis
partially depended on Bax activation [7] (Figure 7B).
PGAM5L shRNA and Drp1 siRNA, but not PGAM5S
shRNA, significantly elevated the viability of SW480
cells treated with 1 μM staurosporine (Figure 7C). The
lower apoptosis rates induced by silencing PGAM5L
and Drp1 might be responsible for the elevated viability
(Figure 7D). Immunoprecipitation data showed that the
interaction between PGAM5 and Drp1 highly depended
on activation of Bax (Figure 7E, lane 2) in HCT116 WT
cells, but not in HCT116 Bax−/− cells, further confirmed
that each component of the Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1 complex
is necessary for the induction of intrinsic apoptosis.

Arenobufagin inhibits growth and metastasis of
orthotopically implanted colorectal carcinoma
through inducing apoptosis
To characterize the role of arenobufagin in apoptosis,
colorectal carcinomas were orthotopically implanted into
BALB/c-nu mice as described previously [23]. Arenobufagin
decreased the tumor volume in situ significantly (Figure
8A). Vernier caliper measurement showed that arenobufagin
decreased the tumor size in a dose - dependent manner
(Figure 8B, Supplementary Figure S5A). Increased TUNEL
positive cells indicated that the cell death induced by
arenobufagin could be due to apoptosis (Figure 8C–8D).
The apoptotic bodies observed by electron microscope
further confirmed that cell death induced by arenobufagin
was apoptosis (Figure 8E). Western blot analysis showed that
cleaved PARP and caspase 3 were increased significantly in
arenobufagin treated mice (Figure 8F). The expression of
Bax was elevated and Drp1 was decreased by arenobufagin

Staurosporine induces the formation of the
Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1 complex
To eliminate the possibility that the Bax-PGAM5LDrp1 complex was only formed in the presence of
arenobufagin, staurosporine was selected to re-examine
if the interactions among Bax, PGAM5L and Drp1 were
indispensable for intrinsic apoptosis execution. The
viability in HCT116 WT cells was significantly lower
than that of HCT116 Bax−/− cells under the treatment
of staurosporine (Figure 7A). Annexin V staining

Visual inspection and in vivo imaging with positron emission
computed tomography provided direct evidences that
arenobufagin decreased lived metastasis of CRC (Figure
8G, and Supplementary Video S1–S4). The metastatic
number and standardized uptake value (SUV) measured by
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were
significantly reduced by arenobufagin (Figure 8H–8I).
Collectively, these results demonstrated that arenobufagin
inhibited the growth and metastasis of CRC by inducing Bax
mediated apoptosis.

significantly alleviated SOCS6-mediated Bax activation
and mitochondrial fragmentation [21]. However, it has
been reported that staurosporine-induced apoptotic cell
death was not affected by PGAM5 knockdown. Our
results with shRNA targeting the 3′-untranslated region of
PGAM5 are consistent with the results that the intrinsic
apoptosis is partially dependent on PGAM5 [21]. These
results are also in agreement with the recent report that
trancated PGAM5 antagonized its binding with inhibitors
of apoptotic protein (IAPs) and triggererd apoptosis
through caspases activation. It has been proposed that
PGAM5 released from the mitochondria is an early
event in apoptosis and could steer the cell away from
necrotic cell death by preventing mitochondrial binding
of receptor-interacting protein (RIP) kinases [25].
PGAM5 contains a non-cleaved N-terminal
mitochondrial targeting sequence that anchors PGAM5 to
the cytosolic side of the outer mitochondrial membrane
(OMM) [25, 26]. Upon induction of apoptosis, there is a
significant release of PGAM5, especially PGAM5 (∆24)
into the cytosol that resembles the kinetics for Smac and
cyto C [25]. However, it has recently been demonstrated
that PGAM5 is predominantly localized to the inner
mitochondrial membrane (IMM) with the C-terminal
PGAM domain facing the intermembrane space [27].
It would also be possible that some membrane proteins
escort the translocation of PGAM5 to the IMM [27].
Mitochondrial proteins destined for the inner membrane
may have more hydrophobic membrane-spanning
segments that function as stop-transfer sequences in
the IMM or serve to insert the polypeptide into the
IMM after it enters the matrix [28]. The possible ultramicropositioning of PGAM5 variants and their roles in
regulating cell death modes still need careful investigation
[3, 25, 29].
It is the first time to show that Bax is required
for PGAM5-Drp1 interaction in both arenobufagin
and staurosporine induced intrinsic apoptosis. PGAM5
failed to interact with Drp1 in HCT116 Bax−/− cells,
which could be rescued by Bax transfection. Our results
provided evidences of direct interaction between PGAM5
and Bax. The Bax was accumulated and oligomerized
in mitochondria both in arenobufagin and staurosporine
induced apoptosis [30]. The translocation of Bax formed
pores on the OMM that were partially framed by a lipid
monolayer [31]. iMAC2 significantly attenuated the
interaction between PGAM5 and Drp1, further confirmed
that Bax is necessary for the formation of PGAM5/Drp1
complex. Together our results suggest that Bax is not only
an indispensable component of the lipid pore, but also a
scaffold protein for the assembly of mitochondria attack
complex consisted of PGAM5 and Drp1 [4, 32].
Drp1 is a protein of the mitochondrial fission
machinery and has been reported to participate in
apoptotic mitochondrial fragmentation. Drp1 is a key

Arenobufagin and cisplatin suppress
heterotropic CRC growth in a
Bax-dependent manner
To further investigate if aenobufagin induced intrinsic
apoptosis is Bax-dependent in vivo, heterotropic CRC
tumors derived from HCT116 Bax+/+ and Bax−/− cells were
xenografted to BALB/c-nu mice. As staurosporine binds
to many kinases with high affinity and low selectivity, it
has been precluded in clinical use [24]. Cisplatin, a widely
used chemotherapy drug which binds to DNA and triggers
apoptosis, was chosen in the in vivo test. The death rate
and body weight loss caused by arenobufagin are lower
than that of caused by cisplatin in both HCT116 Bax+/+ and
Bax−/− tumor bearing mice (Figure 9A–9B). Arenobufagin
decreased tumor weight (P < 0.01) and tumor volume (P
< 0.01) of Bax+/+ tumor as compared to the Bax−/− group.
Cisplatin also decreased tumor weight (P < 0.05) and
tumor volume (P < 0.05) of Bax+/+ tumor as compared
to the Bax−/− group (Figure 9C–9D and Supplementary
Figure S6A). Cleaved PARP and caspase-3 were elevated
in arenobufagin and cisplatin treated Bax+/+ mice but not in
Bax−/− mice (Figure 9E). When baited with PGAM5, Drp1
and Bax were immunoprecipitated from arenobufagin and
cisplatin treated Bax+/+ tumor tissues extracts (Figure 9F).
Bax activation and reduced Drp1 were observed as expected
in arenobufagin and cisplatin treated Bax+/+ mice, but not
Bax−/− mice (Figure 9F and Supplementary Figure S6B).
PGAM5S was only present in the 1% SDS-soluble fraction
but not in our used Triton X-100 extraction buffer [3]. The
in vivo formed complex might be Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1,
but not Bax-PGAM5S-Drp1. These data suggest that both
arenobufagin and cisplatin inhibited the growth of CRC
through apoptosis which depended on the formation of BaxPGAM5L-Drp1 complex.

DISCUSSION
Our experimental data indicated that PGAM5L, one
of the two splice variants of the mitochondrial protein
phosphatase PGAM5, is indispensable for the execution of
intrinsic apoptosis. In suppressor of cytokine signaling 6
(SOCS6) induced intrinsic apoptosis, PGAM5 knockdown

MATERIALS AND METHODS

player in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics.
Oligomerization of Drp1 around mitochondria induces
fission in a GTP-dependent manner [33]. Drp1
Ser637 dephosphorylation or Ser616 phosphorylation
induce the mobilization of Drp1 to mitochondria
and promote mitochondrial fragmentation [34, 35].
Bax has been reported to be co-localized with Drp1
at the mitochondrial constriction sites [36]. In
another research, Drp1 stimulated tBid-induced Bax
oligomerization and cyto C release [37]. Our results
extended the fact that the co-lolalization is PGAM5
dependent because PGAM5 shRNA significantly
attenuated the interaction between Drp1 and Bax.
Arenobufagin induced the interaction between PGAM5
and Drp1 and further dephosphorylated Drp1 and
induced mitochondrial fission.
Mitochondrial fission is an early apoptotic event
occurring within the same time frame as activation
of Bax and permeabilization of the mitochondrial
outer membrane [38]. Bax and Drp1 function prior
tocyto C release in the apoptotic cascade events, with
Drp1 potentially participating in Bax activation [39].
Dominant-negative Drp1 inhibited mitochondrial fission
and Bax accumulation on mitochondria which suggest
that mitochondrial fission machinery acts upstream of
Bax [40]. Then Bax recruitment and oligomerization at
Drp1 foci may promote the stable association of Drp1
with membranes through inducing a shift in Drp1 cycling
dynamics [39]. Constricting ability of Drp1 may also
contribute to the formation of curvature within the outer
membrane that is required for the efficient insertion
of Bax [41]. Here we hypothesize a working model for
the induction of intrinsic apoptosis: the mitochondrial
PGAM5L acts as a beacon for the navigation of Drp1
to the mitochondria upon apoptosis induction, Bax
swiftly translocates and inserts to the mitochondrial
outer membrane and acts as a scaffold for the interaction
of PGAM5 and Drp1. Subsequently, MOMP and
mitochondria fission are induced [42], cyto C and AIF are
released into the cytosol. The former activates the caspase
cascade and the later translocates to the nuclear to induce
intrinsic apoptosis.
The orthotopical and heterotropic models showed
the efficacy of arenobufagin in preventing the growth and
metastasis of CRC, suggesting its therapeutic potential as
an anti-CRC agent with less toxicity. The formation of
Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1 complex can be observed in vitro
in cells treated with arenobufagin and staurosprine. The
complex can also be induced by arenobufagin and cisplatin
in vivo in Bax+/+ tumors. These data provide the first
evidences that PGAM5L controls the Bax activation and
Drp1 dephosphorylation and induces mitochondria fission.
Bax-PGAM5L-Drp1 complex is a potential oncotarget and
is required for inducing intrinsic apoptosis.
