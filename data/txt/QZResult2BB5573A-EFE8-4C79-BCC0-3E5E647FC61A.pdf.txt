ABSTRACT
Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In tumors, the
important role of noncoding RNA regulatory networks has been more and more reveal.
EGFR has been identified as an oncogenic driver of NSCLC, especially activating
mutations EGFR and its inhibition with specific TKIs can generate dramatic tumor
responses. Studies have shown that EGFR plays significant roles in the progression
of NSCLC. Subset analysis of the small proportion of patients with EGFR-mutant lung
cancer showed a disease-free survival benefit, but was underpowered to detect a
survival advantage. Herein, we highlight the progression of EGFR, noncoding RNA,
and their roles in carcinogenesis. We also focus on anti-lung cancer drug development
and EGFR-related drug resistance.

INTRODUCTION

to the one that activates it, readily forming a dimer with
other members of the HER family. Additionally, EGFR
is a receptor of tyrosine kinase (RTK). It is consisted
of a C-terminus intracellular region that possesses the
kinase activity, and an N-terminus extracellular ligandbinding site, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain [5].
The EGFR signaling network plays a significant role in
the epithelial tissues maintenance and growth, active
EGFR signaling is frequently observed in lung cancer,
and EGFR level is related with advanced stage of disease
and bad prognosis [6]. As known, HER family receptor
related malformation from primary lung tumors, NSCLC
brain metastases have some strikingly differences [7].
Therefore, in the development of new drugs for cancer
treatment, EGFR and its signaling components can be
used as targets, such as chimeric monoclonal antibodies
(panitumumab and cetuximab) [8] and TKIs (gefitinib,
erlotinib, and afatinib) [9–11]. However, to date, cancer
heterogeneity and the drug resistance greatly limit the
usefulness of anti-EGFR agents [12].
EGFR gene is an oncogene-driven gene, tyrosine
kinases (TK) active [13]. Meanwhile, discovered in
2004, EGFR mutation is the first molecular alteration in
lung cancer that is shown to confer sensitivity to specific
targeted therapies, namely TKIs [14–17]. EGFR-TKIs
can inhibit EGFR autophosphorylation activation and
its downstream signaling pathways through competitive

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related
mortality worldwide, and more than 1.5 million deaths
is related with it every year [1]. The majority of patients
present with locally advanced or metastatic disease.
Approximately 85% of lung cancers are classified as
non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and include lung
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), and
large cell carcinoma (LCC) histologic subtypes. Over
the past decade, major advances in the understanding of
lung cancer, especially NSCLC, have been achieved [2].
NSCLC is defined as a group of different diseases, and
as an oncogenic driver, epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) has been identified. Blockade of EGFR with
specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) can generate
dramatic tumor responses in NSCLC [3, 4].
EGFR is one of the four members of the HER
family receptors, which compose of EGFR/HER1/
erbB1, HER2/erbB2, HER3/erbB3, and HER4/erbB4.
There are 11 species in the HER family of growth factors
which can be broadly divided into those that specifically
bind with EGFR (EGF, TGF-α, Amphiregulin (AR)),
those that binding with EGFR and HER4 (BTC, HBEGF, Epidermal regulators), and those that binding with
HER3 and HER4 (Neuregulin). Although HER2 has no
corresponding ligand, it usually binds to a ligand similar

binding with the EGFR binding region, preventing the
binding of ATP and EGFR receptors. The EGFR signaling
pathway is summarized in Figure 1.
These molecular alterations could be influential
in SCC and have important implications in lung
cancer treatment [18]. Currently, none of the recurrent
molecular alterations, which are commonly altered in
lung squamous cell carcinoma, have proven to be as
predictive for response to therapy as EGFR alterations
in lung adenocarcinoma. Despite the establishment of
tumor profiling for lung adenocarcinomas, its clinical
benefits for other histologic subtypes of lung cancer, such
as lung SCC and SCLC, remain unclear. Furthermore,
a significant minority of patients with NSCLC have
activating mutations in EGFR [19], patients typically
develop resistance within 9 to 12 months. Moreover,
anti-EGFR antibody therapy uses extensive in treatment
cancer [20].
In summary, studies have been focused on the
underpinning mechanisms the resistance for anti-EGFR
agents, and EGFR mutations play a pivotal role in lung
cancer.

with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade
in lung cancer suggests that immune escape mechanisms
can be conducive to lung tumor etiopathogenesis [37]. 

ACQUIRED RESISTANCE OF EGFR TKIS
In lung cancer, especially in NSCLC, a variety of
EGFR mutations exist which are closely related to tumor
development. The discovery of activating mutations
in EGFR and the eventual approval of TKIs are the
milestones in the history of NSCLC treatment.

First-generation EGFR TKIs
Gefitinib and Erlotinib have greatly improved the
progression-free survival over standard chemotherapy
for EGFR-positive NSCLC. Yet, due to the emergence
of resistance, disease progression eventually occurs in
almost all patients. Quinazoline has the core skeleton of
gefitinib and erlotinib combined with EGFR reversibility.
However, almost all patients who received gefitinib/
erlotinib treatment eventually and inevitably acquired
resistance, with a median progression-free survival (mPFS)
of approximately 9 to 11 months [38]. The most common
mechanism of acquired resistance is point mutation of
exon 20 to T790M, with an incidence of approximately
50% to 60% [39] (Figure 2). The threonine (T) at site 790
of EGFR is located at the ATP bound pocket of the tail end,
and mutations in the kinase receptor-binding region form
a huge chain methionine(M) residue, resulting in steric
hindrance, which affects EGFR TKIs from binding to the
receptor. Other mechanisms of resistance include MET
gene amplification [40], small cell transformation [41],
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [42], and so on.

EGFR AS A TARGET IN LUNG CANCER
TREATMENT
Currently many studies have highlighted the
relationship between EGFR and cancers. High expression
of EGFR correlates with poor survival in cancer of the head
and neck, as well as in cervical carcinoma and bladder
[20–22]. In NSCLC, EGFR as a prognostic factor remains
disputable. Some studies have verified that EGFR overexpression is predictive of a poor result in NSCLC [23–27],
whereas others don’t found such situation [27–29].
In the progression of NSCLC, EGFR, regarded as
the cancer driver gene [30, 31], demonstrates the effects
of numerous oncogenic, including stimulating DNA
synthesis, cell cycle, cell proliferation, cell metastasis and
invasion [32, 33], and has been proposed as an attractive
and promising target for anti-cancer treatment [34]. The
expression of high level of EGFR, the pathway can also
be up-regulated by coexpression of receptor ligands
(such as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) or EGF).
Moreover, the duration of the EGFR signaling pathways
are stimulated by the positive feedback loop formed by
EGFR, a ligand-releasing protease and the RAS-MAPK
signaling pathway (Figure 1). As the signaling response
can be prolonged in a cell that is efficient in recapturing
the endogenous ligand, in spite of the levels of EGFR
expressed may be low [35]. Furthermore, a research
in breast cancer verified that co-expression of TGF-α
and EGFR had a more remarkable effect on survival,
comparing to the co-expression of HER-2 and EGFR [36].
In lung cancer, one study has reported that synchronous
expression of EGFR and HER-2 is predictive of
increased recurrence risk. Moreover, the success therapy

Second-generation EGFR TKIs
The second-generation EGFR TKIs were designed,
in order to get around the problem of gefitinib and erlotinib
resistance, and mainly included BIBW 2992 (afatinib),
PF00299804 (dacomitinib), HKI-272 (neratinib),
CI-1033(canertinib). The second-generation EGFR TKIs
have greater potential to overcome or delay withstand
to the first-generation EGFR TKIs [43], and have
improvements in target, binding form, and efficacy.
Sufficient evidences have not yet been accumulated to
determine whether or not they can overcome the resistance
to first-generation EGFR TKIs entirely. Recent discoveries
based on these principles continue to inspire the next
generation of innovative clinical trials in this diseases.

Third-generation EGFR TKIs
To date, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI is
an unavoidable process and usually appears after
10–12 months of therapy. New EGFR-TKIs with specific

CANCER

capability bind to T790M mutated receptor have been
developed and successfully tested in patients with
acquired resistance [44, 45]. Moreover, the emerging
third-generation EGFR TKIs have demonstrated high
tolerability, through tested the higher ability to spare
EGFR wild-type counterpart. The most famous of the third
generation TKI is AZD9291 (osimertinib). It can response
highly rate to drug-resistance in T790M mutations. Some
patients showed resistance to this drug, and the major
mutation site is C797S on the EGFR gene by the discovery
of genome sequencing. The reason to drug resistance is
including C-MET amplification, small cell lung cancer
transformation, and downstream genes (KRAS or
BRAF) activation. So patients can be controlled using a
combination of the first and three generation EGFR-TKIs.
With these evidences, AZD9291 (osimertinib), HM61713
(olmutinib), CO-1686 (rociletinib) and others (ASP8273,
EGF816) are object of several clinical trials and AZD9291
has already obtained FDA and EMA approval for the
therapy of EGFR mutant T790M-positive NSCLC [46].
In the future, when EGFR-TKI drug resistance
occurs, genetic testing could be used to select the treatment
method corresponding to the resistance mechanism.

Precision medicine in the treatment of lung cancer
has dramatically impacted diagnostic pathology, and
precision medicine provides a better comprehension of
both the mechanism of the disease at the molecular level.
The discovery of EGFR mutations and ALKrearrangements were the first molecular alterations in
lung adenocarcinoma that confer sensitivity to TKIs
in 2004 and 2007 (Figure 3), heralding the initiation of
the era of precision medicine for lung [15, 47]. Among
EGFR mutations, EGFRT790M mutation was a clear target
for drug development to address the important precision
medicine need, which identified as a mechanism of
resistance to TKIs (Figure 3). The remarkable responses
to TKIs observed in patients as well as the discoveries
made studying these molecular subsets of lung cancer,
served as catalysts for further exploration of the lung
cancer genome, leading to the incorporation of molecular
testing in routine clinical practice. Clinical trials have
revealed that treatment of advanced EGFR lung cancers
is superior to chemotherapy, using the appropriate TKIs

[19, 48]. Conversely, it has also been shown that patients
with the mutant EGFR lung cancers rarely respond
to EGFR TKIs and are more likely to benefit from
chemotherapy, underlining the importance of matching
tumor genotype to therapy [48]. Here, we show the
timeline of the history of EGFR development in recent
years (Figure 3). At present and future efforts to find new
types of precision medicine for lung cancers is necessary
to improve outcomes for patients with lung cancer, as well
as biomarker-driven clinical trials. In lung cancer, the
impact of precision medicine has resulted in considerable
changes as well as challenges in diagnostic pathology [49].

the lung cancer cells resistance to anti-EGFR therapy.
Additionally, miRNAs could also be employed as novel
therapeutic targets to circumvent the resistance of lung
cancer cells to EGFR inhibitors, and as biomarkers for
response to anti-EGFR agents.

LncRNAs in EGFR- TKIs for lung cancer
Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-coding
RNAs with a length > 200 nt. It has been revealed that
lncRNAs are involved in a number of biological processes,
such as chromatin modification, gene regulation,
transcription activation and interference, and cellular
processes, including cell apoptosis, migration, tumor
invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance [82–84]. They
play vital roles in the tumor incidence and development.
Currently study shown that lncRNAs can connect
to transcription sites and regulate both the expression of
alleles and a long fragment, whereas coding genes and
miRNAs have no such functions [85]. This suggests that
lncRNAs may be better epigenetic regulators in gene
expression regulation. Research has shown that some
lncRNAs, including lncRNA UCA1, H19, BC200, and
BC087858, were increased in gefitinib-resistant human
lung cancer cells, as determined by lncRNA microarray
analysis [86]. Studies have also demonstrated that lncRNA
UCA1 may stimulate non-T790M acquired resistance
for EGFR-TKIs by activating the AKT/mTOR pathway
and EMT [87]. Moreover, over-expression of lncRNA
BC087858 could act via a novel mechanism by which
acquired resistance for EGFR-TKIs can develop in
EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients without T790M mutation
[88]. Another study showed that stimulation of the PI3K/
AKT and MEK/ERK pathways, as well as EMT, could
be implicated in the resistance to EGFR-TKIs [89, 90].
Herein, we illustrate that lncRNAs are involved in the
EGFR signaling pathway, as displayed in Figure 4.
In conclusion, further exploration of the function
and mechanism of lncRNAs will reveal their critical
role in the process of lung cancer generation, and their
significance as a diagnostic tool as well as in the treatment
of cancer.

NONCODING RNA AND EGFR
MiRNAs in EGFR-targeted therapies for lung
cancer
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small
noncoding RNAs that act as key post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression. They can functionally
impact cell fate determination through the regulation of
critical protein expression, thus playing a pivotal role in
the diverse processes of human cancer, acting as either
tumor oncogenes or suppressors [50–53]. Recently,
increasing numbers of miRNAs have been correlated
with the drug resistance of lung cancer cells to antiEGFR agents, indicating that miRNAs may serve as
novel targets or promising predictive biomarkers for antiEGFR  therapy. Moreover, miRNA-based therapy has
been suggested to be a rational and potentially effective
approach for the therapeutic targeting of EGFR [54].
Recently, a number of miRNAs, such as miR-200a, miR27a/27b, miR-133a, and miR-134 have been verified to
directly target EGFR [54–58] (Table 1). These EGFRmiRNAs regulation network studies demonstrated that
miRNA-based therapy could possibly be utilized to target
EGFR, except for TKIs and classical mAbs for EGFRtargeted therapies [54].
Our lab has confirmed that miR-34a, miR-181a-5p,
miR-32, and miR-486-5p play vital roles in the progression
of NSCLC [59–61]. Our recent study demonstrated that
miR-34a can suppress NSCLC by directly targeting
EGFR in vitro and in vivo (paper in under-decision).These
findings demonstrate that altered miRNA expression may
be related to the oncogenesis of lung cancer. Some studies
have verified that EGFR mutations can be regulated by
miRNA in cancer therapies. At present study, small RNA
possesses the best potential as a diagnostic biomarkers
and therapeutic drug for cancer, which is the most mature
miRNA. For instance, because of its pivotal role in lung
cancer, liver cancer, breast cancer, and among others, miR34a is considered to be the most likely of the miRNAs to
become a diagnostic marker and target of drugs [62–64] .
In conclusion, the emerging role of miRNAs as
regulators could not only active EGFR signaling, but also

tRNA-derived RNA fragments and EGFR
A close connection has been established between
cancers and a variety of small noncoding RNAs, such
as miRNAs, piRNAs, and circRNAs, but not including
tRNA-derived RNA fragments (tRFs). tRFs, the
class of small RNAs, are noncoding-stranded RNAs
14–35 nt in length, which always derive from the 5′ end
or 3′ end of tRNA in the particular environment [91]. The
length and the generation of tRFs are very similar to those
of miRNAs. Through the action of anticodon-cleaving
enzymes, some tRNA cleavages can be generated from
mature tRNAs. The biological function of tRFs is still

processes, tRFs have the capacity to regulate some
cellular processes, including translational efficiency

However, their biological function has drawn the
attention of many research efforts. Some studies have
shown that, in biological processes, the function of 5’ tRFs

In addition, it has been found that tRFs suppress breast

of this disease have been elaborated in part, among them
the EGFR pathway is one of the well-known signal
cascades that play a pivotal role in oncogenesis. In lung
cancer, dysregulation of EGFR signaling is frequently
found. Strategies to effectively inhibit the EGFR
signaling pathway have been mounted for developing
anticancer therapeutic agents. However, on account of the
development of drug-resistance, most anti-EGFR-targeted
agents are unable to repress cancer progression. Therefore,
studies of the mechanisms underpinning the resistance
toward anti-EGFR agents may afford important findings for
the use of anti-EGFR therapies in lung cancer treatment.
Finally, when determining the applicability
of EGFR-TKI in practice, clinical benefit should be
carefully analyzed based on clinical background and the
prediction of the presence or absence of EGFR mutations.
Furthermore, immune-based cancer prevention can
also influence premalignant biology. It has been shown
that cancer vaccines reprogram the immune response to
prevent, reject, and detect premalignant cells, which might
be applicable in EGFR therapy [102]. Going forward, in
lung cancer, EGFR may be the rising star in the era of
precision medicine.

PERSPECTIVES AND CHALLENGE IN
EGFR-RELATED STUDY
The evolution of modern medical technology
has enabled advancements in research to reveal the
mechanism of the development of a variety of incurable
disease. In the case of cancer, the emerging view is
that cancer is a “genetic disease”. With next generation
sequencing technology and promotion of the human
genome project, the treatment of cancer has been gradually
moving towards the era of precision therapy. Under this
condition, new therapies take advantage of RNA and other
powerful features targeting genes that play a critical role
in tumorigenesis.
The importance of miRNA regulatory network’s role
in tumors has been revealed more and more. Meanwhile,
we should combine molecular mechanisms to overcome
the emergence of resistance. As described in this review,
several molecular pathways underlying the mechanisms
