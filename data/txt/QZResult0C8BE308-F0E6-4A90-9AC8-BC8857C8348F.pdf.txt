Abstract
Recent studies have implicated the involvement of cell surface forms of nucleolin in tumor growth. In this
study, we investigated whether a synthetic ligand of cell-surface nucleolin known as N6L could exert antitumor
activity. We found that N6L inhibits the anchorage-dependent and independent growth of tumor cell lines and
that it also hampers angiogenesis. Additionally, we found that N6L is a proapoptotic molecule that increases
Annexin V staining and caspase-3/7 activity in vitro and DNA fragmentation in vivo. Through affinity isolation
experiments and mass-spectrometry analysis, we also identified nucleophosmin as a new N6L target. Notably, in
mouse xenograft models, N6L administration inhibited human tumor growth. Biodistribution studies carried
out in tumor-bearing mice indicated that following administration N6L rapidly localizes to tumor tissue,
consistent with its observed antitumor effects. Our findings define N6L as a novel anticancer drug candidate
warranting further investigation. Cancer Res; 71(9); 3296–305. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Surface nucleolin expression is enhanced in various
tumor cell lines and in activated endothelial cells (1–4).
Furthermore, several molecules related to cell proliferation
or cell differentiation have been reported to be ligands for
cell-surface nucleolin. Among these molecules are hepatocyte growth factor, pleotrophin, and midkine, all of which
play important roles in tumor development (5–8). In addition, molecules such as urokinase, which are involved in
mechanisms regulating pericellular proteolysis and cellsurface adhesion mitogenesis, bind and are cointernalized

along with cell-surface nucleolin (9, 10). Other cell-surface
nucleolin binding proteins, such as laminin-1, factor J, and
L- and P-selectins, are involved in cell differentiation, cell
adhesion regulation, leukocyte trafficking, inflammation,
and angiogenesis (11–14). Cell-surface nucleolin has been
validated as a novel target for anticancer therapy by using
several molecules such as endostatin, the AS1411 aptamer,
acharan sulfate, the F3 tumor-homing peptide coupled to
radioactive isotopes (15–17), and the HB-19 pseudopeptide
(18). Furthermore, targeting nucleolin with a specific antibody results in the activation of endothelial cell apoptosis
by decreasing antiapoptotic Bcl-2 mRNA in the tumor
vasculature (19).
In addition to its functions at the cell surface, nucleolin
plays a critical role in the apoptotic process in which it
regulates fundamental proteins such as Bcl-2, p53, and retinoblastoma. In chronic B-cell leukemia cells, overexpression
of nucleolin has been directly linked to Bcl-2 mRNA stabilization, leading to apoptosis blockade and resistance (20, 21). In
MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells and HeLa cells, a decrease in
nucleolin level leads to an increase in p53 and apoptosis (22,
23). Nucleolin associates with tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein, leading to cancer cell transformation (24).
In this study, we have investigated the antitumor activities,
the mechanism of action, and the biodistribution in mice
bearing human xenograft tumors of a synthetic ligand of cellsurface nucleolin known as N6L. In addition, using affinity
isolation experiments and mass-spectrometry analysis, we
identified other N6L molecular partners.

Antitumoral Activity of Multivalent Pseudopeptides

Materials and Methods
Peptide constructs
Synthesis of N4L, N5L, N6L, and N8L is described in detail in
Supplementary Methods; briefly, the lysine-rich template is a
310 helical matrix composed respectively of 4, 5, 6, and 8
repeats of Lys-Aib-Gly, the pseudotripeptides Lys[CH2N]ProArg being grafted onto the e NH2 of the matrix Lys residues.
Fluorescent conjugates were prepared starting from the N6LCys derivative. The various conjugates were then purified
by high-performance liquid chromatography and lyophilized.
Cell growth and toxicity assays
Cell growth was carried out as previously described (18) and
cell viability measured and quantified by Cell Titer Aqueous
One (MTS assay) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane assay
Chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay was carried out as
previously described (18).
Tumor cell xenograft in nude mice
Experiments with human solid tumor xenografts in nude
mice were carried out as previously described (18). For
lymphoma experiments, A20 (5  106) or T29 lymphoma
(5  105) was injected into BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse tail
vein after irradiation at 3.5 Gy/mice. Five days later, mice were
randomly separated into 2 groups and treated with NaCl 0.9%
(control group) or N6L 8 mg/kg 5 times per week by i.p.
injection. All in vivo experiments were carried out with the
approval of the appropriate ethical committee and under
conditions established by the European Union.
In vivo tumor targeting of N6L
N6L-alexa fluor 633 (100 mg/mouse) was injected through
the tail vein into nude mice bearing MDA-MB 231 xenograft
tumors. Images were taken using the NightOwl Bioimager
(Berthold Technologies). Signal intensity was evaluated using
WinLight32 software.
Tissue preparation and apoptosis assay
Immediately after surgical resection, MDA-MB 231 tumors
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 C. Fragmented DNA was stained using the ApopTag Isol Dual Fluorescent
kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Millipore).
Positive terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) cells were automatically
counted by a program detecting the maximum of Sobel's
gradients, as previously described (25).
In vitro apoptosis assays
Cell death occurring in the presence of the N6L peptide was
measured on a time scale of 30 minutes to 24 hours. Briefly,
treated cells were harvested, rinsed, and resuspended in
Annexin V-binding buffer containing allophycocyanin
(APC)-labeled Annexin V (BD Bioscience) and propidium
iodide (PI). Samples were analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). The decrease in the mitochon-

www.aacrjournals.org

drial transmembrane potential was detected by the reduction
of DiOC6 (3) dye uptake, and caspase-3/7 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 detection assay kit according
to the manufacturer's instruction (Promega).
Immunofluorescence staining and ApoTome
microscopy
For immunofluorescence assays, after adding N6L-alexa
fluor 488 0.5 mmol/L at 37 C for 30 minutes, cells were washed
and fixed with cold acetone at 20 C for 10 minutes or with
paraformaldehyde (PFA) 4% at room temperature for 10
minutes. Nucleolin and nucleophosmin were revealed using
antinucleolin (MS-3, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) and antinucleophosmin (Abcam) antibodies. DAPI 1 mg/mL was used
for nuclear staining. All slides were observed with an AxioObserver Z.1 microscope equipped with an ApoTome system of
structured illumination (Zeiss).
Short interfering RNA transfection
MDA-MB 435 cells were plated in 6 wells-plates and
incubated for 24 hours at 37 C. Cells were then transfected
at a final concentration of 100 nmol/L short interfering RNA
(siRNA) using Lipofectamine 2,000 reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleolin
and nucleophosmin siRNA were purchased from Abnova,
and GFP siRNA was purchased from Ambion.
Surface plasmon resonance analysis
All binding experiments were conducted using the BIACORE 3000 system and are described in detail in Supplementary Methods.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was determined by the ANOVA
unpaired t test, using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software. Values
of P < 0.05 were considered significant. Comparisons of
survival curves were made using the Kaplan–Meier product-limit method and analysis by the log rank test. Statistical
significance was defined as P < 0.05.

Results
Effect of N6L on tumor and endothelial cell survival and
proliferation
We generated multivalent pseudopeptide analogues for use
in exploring the most efficient size and shape of the template
and the optimal number of grafted pseudotripeptides
Lys[CH2N]Pro-Arg. We then investigated the effects of these
compounds on cell growth, using T29 cells. Comparative
studies indicated that the optimum inhibitory effect was
achieved with N6L (Fig. 1A). No effect of N6L was observed
on the viability of BALB/c mouse lymph node cells used as a
control (data not shown). N6L is built on a lysine-rich helicoid
template formed by a repeat of 6 tripeptide units, (Lys-AibGly), the pseudotripeptides Lys[CH2N]Pro-Arg being bound to
the Lys eNH2 groups of the template (Fig. 1B).
We then investigated the effect of N6L in a soft-agar colonyforming assay. In all cases, colony formation was reduced by

50% or more, except for MDA-MB 231, in which 40% inhibition
was observed (Fig. 1C and D).
Whatever the type of tumor cell, cell growth was significantly inhibited by N6L, with an inhibition of cell growth
(GI50) value ranging from 5 to more than 40 mmol/L
(Table 1). In addition, N6L significantly inhibited growth
of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), with a
60% reduction at 10 mmol/L N6L (Fig. 2A). No effect was
observed in cells treated with highly basic compounds
such as polyarginine. In in vivo angiogenic assay, addition
of N6L impaired the branching of newly formed blood
vessels in comparison with the PBS control (Fig. 2B).
Quantitative analysis indicated that the maximal inhibition
of angiogenesis was reached with the application of 400
pmol of N6L.
Antitumor effect of the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L
To determine the in vivo efficacy of N6L as an antitumor
molecule, we carried out several experiments with mice

3298

bearing human xenograft tumors and murine lymphoma.
Compared with the control, N6L induced significant inhibition
of tumor growth in mice grafted with MDA-MB 231 or PC3
cells. Indeed, N6L used at concentrations as low as 1 mg/kg
inhibited tumor growth up to 90% (P < 0.001) and 40% for
MDA-MB 231 and PC3 cells, respectively (Fig. 2C and D). It is
worth mentioning that N6L efficacy on MDA-MB 231 is
optimal between low and high doses, which may reveal a
biphasic dose response as already observed for other regulators of cell growth (26).
Similar results were obtained by analyzing the weights of
tumors harvested from tumor-bearing mice (Supplementary
Fig. S1). Consistent with in vitro observations (Table 1),
the survival of N6L-treated mice bearing A20 and T29
lymphomas was significantly prolonged compared with
controls (Fig. 2E and F). We found no apparent toxicity
in several organs of N6L-treated mice and did not observe
significant changes in their body weight compared with
control mice (data not shown). These results indicate that

N6L effectively reduced tumor growth in mice without
evidence of toxicity.
Identification of N6L cell targets
To identify molecular targets of N6L, we undertook a series
of affinity isolation experiments based on a previously
described method (27) using Raji and MDA-MB 231 cells
and biotin-labeled N6L. Affinity isolated proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by mass spectrometry
(Supplementary Table S1). This procedure enabled us to
identify several proteins involved in a ribonucleoproteic complex, including nucleolin and nucleophosmin (Fig. 3A). This
result was validated by Western blot experiments (Fig. 3B).
Analysis of the equilibrium binding parameters using surface
plasmon resonance experiments indicated that both nucleolin
and nucleophosmin bound to N6L in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3C). The interaction of nucleolin and nucleophosmin
with N6L was deemed to be monophasic with an affinity
constant of 0.5 and 1 nmol/L, respectively. In contrast, no
binding was observed either with ribosomal L5 protein used as
a control (Fig. 3C) or with HSC70 and glutathione S-transferase proteins (data not shown). Moreover, considering that
nucleolin and nucleophosmin are usually found to be asso-

www.aacrjournals.org

ciated with RNA in the ribosome biogenesis pathway, we
investigated whether the interaction between nucleolin or
nucleophosmin and N6L is direct or dependent on a bridging
molecule like RNA. Treatment of the affinity isolated fraction
with a large excess of RNAse revealed that nucleolin—but not
nucleophosmin—interactions with N6L were RNA-mediated
(Fig. 3B). This indicated that, whereas N6L is able to interact
with both nucleolin and nucleophosmin, RNA could modulate
nucleolin structure to promote N6L binding to nucleolin.
These results are reinforced by data from cell-surface biotinylation experiments which provided evidence on the presence of nucleophosmin and nucleolin at the tumor cell
surface (Fig. 3D), as well as on the colocalization of N6L with
nucleophosmin in nonpermeabilized MDA-MB 231 cells
(Fig. 3E).
N6L is translocated into the nucleolus
We used N6L conjugated with various fluorescent reagents
to study its cell trafficking. Fluorescent peptides appeared in
both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 4A). Addition of 100fold molar excess of unlabeled N6L completely abolished
staining, demonstrating the specificity of the signal
(Fig. 4B). Double-immunofluorescent staining with antinucleolin antibody and N6L-alexa fluor 488 revealed an overlap
of the nucleolin signal with that of the N6L-alexa fluor 488
(Fig. 4D), indicating that N6L translocates to the nucleolus.
Similar observations were obtained with N6L-rhodamine validating these observations (data not shown). In addition, N6L
translocation to the nucleolus was energy-dependent because
it was inhibited when the cells were incubated at 4 C with
0.02% sodium azide to block active internalization (Fig. 4C).
Taken together, these results are consistent with the translocation of N6L from the cell surface to the nucleolus. These
data were reinforced by the observation carried out on living
cells by using time-lapse imaging (Supplementary Movie, File
N6L2.mp4). In addition, knockdown of nucleolin or nucleophosmin by siRNA strongly decreased N6L translocation from
cell surface to nucleolus (Fig. 4E and F). This result provides
strong evidence that nucleolin and nucleophosmin are
involved in N6L trafficking.
N6L exhibits a proapoptotic activity in vitro
We used video microscopy to carry out direct analysis of the
metabolism of the N6L pseudopeptide. MDA-MB 231 cells
were incubated in the presence of N6L-alexa fluor 488 and
analyzed for 14 hours by time-lapse video microscopy. Treated
cells rapidly rounded and revealed morphologic features of
characteristic apoptosis, such as cell shrinkage, cell membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies (Fig. 5A
and Supplementary Movie).
To validate these observations, apoptosis of N6L-treated
cells was quantified by flow cytometry using Annexin V/PI and
DIOC6 staining. N6L markedly increased Raji cell apoptosis in a
concentration-dependent (Fig. 5B and C) and time-dependent
manner (Fig. 5D). Similar data were obtained using MDA-MB
231 and MDA-MB 435 cells (Supplementary Table S2). To
further confirm that N6L-induced cell death was due to apoptosis, we analyzed caspase-3/7 activation, which is considered

to be a common hallmark of apoptosis. Raji cells were treated
with concentrations of N6L ranging from 0 to 50 mmol/L for 48
hours and caspase-3 activity was determined in the cell lysate.
N6L was found to induce caspase-3/7 activation in a dosedependent manner. A 2-fold increase in caspase-3/7 activity
compared with the basal level was observed in cells treated
with 20 mmol/L N6L (Fig. 5E).
In vivo tumor targeting of N6L
Mice bearing MDA-MB 231 tumors were i.v. injected with
100 mg of N6L-alexa fluor 633 and subjected to fluorescence
tracking in a bioimager. Images were collected every 2 minutes
over the first 20 minutes, then every 24 hours. N6L-alexa fluor
633 revealed wide tissue distribution, including tumor tissue,
immediately after injection, thus demonstrating the rapid
addressing of the peptide due to efficient perfusion
(Fig. 6A). A persistent signal in the tumor and in various
other organs, including lung, kidney, liver, and brain, was
observed. Postmortem collection of these tissues confirmed
the retention of N6L-alexa fluor 633 24 hours postinjection.
The signal intensity progressively decreased in all organs while
increasing in the tumor mass until 48 hours postinjection,
revealing the natural enrichment of the N6L pseudopeptide in

3300

tumors (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, persistent enrichment of N6Lalexa fluor 633 was also observed in the tumor mass in case of
repeated injections (every day for 3 days; Fig. 6C). In addition,
and as a control, we also monitored the distribution of N6Lalexa fluor 633 in mice without implanted tumor cells. In this
case, we observed widespread distribution with most of the
pseudopeptide being in lung, kidney, and liver, whereas no
detectable signal was found in spleen and brain (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). An additional control was carried out
with the inactive N6L-alexa fluor 633 template in mice bearing
tumors. A widespread distribution was also observed with no
detectable fluorescence enrichment in the tumor mass (Supplementary Fig. S5).
N6L mediates caspase-dependent apoptosis in vivo
Sections of tumor xenografts from MDA-MB 231 cells
treated or not with N6L were subjected to TUNEL staining
(Fig. 5F). This staining causes a red fluorescence to appear
that corresponds to a 50 PO4 DNA fragment cleaved by type I
DNAse activated by caspase-3 and involved in self-execution
apoptosis, as well as a green fluorescence that corresponds to
an independently activated 50 -OH DNA fragment cleaved by
type II DNAse caspase. Low red and green fluorescence was

Figure 3. Identification of the molecular targets of N6L. A, biotin-labeled N6L binds to a nucleoproteic complex including nucleolin and nucleophosmin
expressed on the surface of Raji or MDA-MB 231 cells. Affinity isolated proteins with biotin-labeled N6L (þ) or without () were subjected to SDS-PAGE and
revealed by colloidal blue for mass spectrometry identification. B, identification of nucleolin and nucleophosmin in isolated fraction was confirmed by
immunoblot analysis. Pretreatment of cellular lysate without () or with (þ) RNase A (100 mg/mL) was carried out to evaluate impact on identified interactions.
C, direct binding of N6L to recombinant nucleolin, nucleophosmin, and ribosomal L5 protein used at different concentrations, as measured in surface plasmon
resonance experiments. D, MDA-MB 231 cell-surface protein expression. Cell-surface proteins were labeled with biotin. Biotinylated proteins (BP) were
purified on streptavidin beads and then subjected to SDS-PAGE, and the presence of nucleolin, nucleophosmin, and GAPDH was revealed by Western blot.
Nonbiotinylated protein lysate (Ct) purified on streptavidin beads served as control for purification specificity. Normal protein lysate (PL) was used to observe
the expected bands. E, colocalization of N6L and nucleophosmin on MDA-MB 231. Cells were fixed by PFA 4%, and N6L-alexa fluor 488 0.5 mmol/L was

observed in control tumors, indicating that the number of
apoptotic cells was very low (relative score of 1,911  487, n ¼
5). In N6L-treated tumors, strong red signals (relative score of
35,580  8,553, n ¼ 5)—but no green ones—were observed.
Comparison of the relative scores indicated that the inhibition of tumor growth in athymic mice by N6L occurred
through the induction of caspase-dependent cell apoptosis
(P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained in experiments
carried out using xenograft PC-3 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
The results presented in this study demonstrate the antitumor activity of a new multivalent pseudopeptide called N6L.

www.aacrjournals.org

Using an optical imaging system, this effect was validated in
vivo, showing that N6L specifically targeted the tumor. These
experiments were carried out in mice bearing MDA-MB 231
(Fig. 6A) or U373MG tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4). One of
the major result of this study is the demonstration that N6L
promotes apoptosis, as shown in both in vitro and in vivo
experiments. Induction of apoptosis by N6L was directly
observed by video microscopy in N6L-treated cells that exhibited abnormal cell morphology characteristic of apoptosis
(28). Nucleolin has been identified as a Bcl-2 mRNA-stabilizing
protein in the HL-60 human leukemia cell line (20, 29). More
recently, it has been shown that the resistance of B-cell
lymphocytic leukemias to apoptosis as a result of Bcl-2 gene
overexpression is related to stabilization of Bcl-2 mRNA by

nucleolin (21). In addition, siRNA knockdown of nucleolin
resulted in decreased Bcl-2 mRNA stability and decreased
levels of Bcl-2 protein in MCF-7 cells (30). Interestingly, several
nucleolin ligands were shown to be involved in the induction
of apoptosis. For example, the nucleolin-targeting aptamer
AS1411 has been shown to induce apoptosis by interfering
with the binding of nucleolin to Bcl-2 mRNA (30). Similarly,
antinucleolin antibody treatment destabilizes Bcl-2 mRNA,
leading to endothelial cell apoptosis (19). Endostatin, a 20-kDa
polypeptide that is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis and
tumor growth (31), binds specifically cell-surface nucleolin
(17). Study of the mechanism of action of endostatin on tumor
growth has indicated that it induces apoptosis through activation of caspase-3 and a decrease in Bcl-2 mRNA (32, 33).
Taken together, these observations indicate that cell-surface
nucleolin is highly involved in the apoptosis process, which is
also supported by the present results showing that N6L is a
proapoptotic molecule able to induce tumor cell death.
Although cell-surface nucleolin is a good candidate for N6Lmediated apoptosis induction, we cannot exclude that other

3302

Cancer Res; 71(9) May 1, 2011

N6L-binding proteins and/or nucleolin-binding proteins could
be involved and might play a role in this process. To test this
hypothesis, a series of affinity isolation experiments were
carried out. As expected, nucleolin was identified, but also
several other proteins, including ribosomal proteins and signal
recognition particle proteins involved in the packing and
transport of RNA, as well as nucleophosmin. Because all the
proteins identified in this experiment belong to a protein family
that shares the common property of being able to bind
nucleolin, we can assume that most of these affinity-isolated
proteins are associated in a macromolecular complex that
includes cell-surface nucleolin (34). Among these proteins,
nucleophosmin is an important target for cancer suppression
and is involved in apoptosis regulation. Studies using a peptide
derived from Rev protein, which binds nucleophosmin, suppressed tumor growth through apoptosis by upregulating the
transcriptional activity of p53. Recently, NSC348884, a pharmacophore that targets nucleophosmin, has been shown to
inhibit the proliferation of various cancer cell lines through the
induction of apoptosis (35). Likewise, it has been shown that

nucleophosmin oligomer formation and induce apoptosis.
From this set of results, we can hypothesize that N6L, which
is a pseudopeptide rich in Lys and Arg residues and displays
high affinity for nucleophosmin, disrupts its oligomerization
and/or the formation of complexes between nucleolin, nucleophosmin, and oncoproteins. Another piece of data presented
herein concerns cellular trafficking of N6L to the tumor cell
nucleolus. Following its binding to cell-surface nucleoproteins,
N6L is internalized and rapidly concentrates in the nucleolus.
This result was obtained using fluorescent video-microscopy
analysis on live cells and was further confirmed by histologic
studies using N6L tagged with fluorescent molecules. The
mechanism by which N6L is translocated to the nucleolus
remains unknown and is currently under investigation. However, it is tempting to speculate that N6L could be translocated
to the nucleolus through its interaction with nucleoproteins.
These results are supported by our experiments on N6L
trafficking on nucleolin and nucleophosmin knockdown cells.
Nevertheless, the relationship between localization of N6L in
the nucleolus and its biological effect has not yet been established and will be explored in further studies.
Viewed collectively, the data presented in this article indicate that the multivalent pseudopeptide N6L induces apoptosis of tumor cells, which could therefore constitute a

possible mechanism by which N6L demonstrates antitumor
activity. Both nucleolin and nucleophosmin are multifunctional pleiotropic proteins involved in several important cell
processes, suggesting that the antiproliferative effect of N6L
could be mediated by several different mechanisms of action
that remain to be identified.
