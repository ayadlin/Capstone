Abstract
In many cancers, aberrant Notch activity has been demonstrated to play a role in the initiation and maintenance of the
neoplastic phenotype and in cancer stem cells, which may allude
to its additional involvement in metastasis and resistance to
therapy. Therefore, Notch is an exceedingly attractive therapeutic
target in cancer, but the full range of potential targets within the
pathway has been underexplored. To date, there are no smallmolecule inhibitors that directly target the intracellular Notch
pathway or the assembly of the transcriptional activation
complex. Here, we describe an in vitro assay that quantitatively
measures the assembly of the Notch transcriptional complex on
DNA. Integrating this approach with computer-aided drug design,
we explored potential ligand-binding sites and screened for

compounds that could disrupt the assembly of the Notch
transcriptional activation complex. We identiﬁed a small-molecule inhibitor, termed Inhibitor of Mastermind Recruitment-1
(IMR-1), that disrupted the recruitment of Mastermind-like 1 to
the Notch transcriptional activation complex on chromatin,
thereby attenuating Notch target gene transcription. Furthermore,
IMR-1 inhibited the growth of Notch-dependent cell lines and
signiﬁcantly abrogated the growth of patient-derived tumor xenografts. Taken together, our ﬁndings suggest that a novel class of
Notch inhibitors targeting the transcriptional activation complex
may represent a new paradigm for Notch-based anticancer therapeutics, warranting further preclinical characterization. Cancer

Introduction

acquired resistance. However, the number of "druggable" targets
is ﬁnite, which represents a potential hurdle to personalized
medicine. As most proteins function in higher order complexes
mediated by protein–protein interactions, targeting these interactions represents a broad range of potential targets and therapeutics to be explored.
The Notch pathway is widely utilized in development to govern
cell fate speciﬁcation and to balance proliferative capacity and
differentiation state (1, 2). In the adult, the Notch pathway is
restricted to small populations of progenitor and stem cells of
regenerating tissues such as the colon and brain (3, 4). However,
in many human cancers, the Notch pathway becomes reactivated
(for review, see ref. 5). The deregulation of the Notch pathway
underlies many aspects of cancer physiology in a cell type- and
context-dependent manner (5–7). Aberrant Notch activity has
been demonstrated to play a role in the initiation and maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype as well as playing a central role
in cancer stem cells, thereby underlying a role in metastasis and
resistance to therapy (8, 9).
Notch drives a context-dependent cellular response by
initiating and maintaining a transcriptional cascade (10, 11). This
transcriptional response is mediated by Notch by directing the
formation of a core transcriptional activation complex, termed
the Notch ternary complex (NTC). The NTC comprises the
DNA-binding protein CSL [CBF-1/RBP-J, Su(H), Lag-1], the intracellular domain of Notch (NICD), and the coactivator protein
Mastermind-like 1 (Maml1; refs. 12–14). Current approaches to
inhibit the Notch pathway include mAbs that target and disrupt

The promise of precision treatment for cancer is predicated on
the assumption that a comprehensive array of targeted therapeutics will be available in the future. Therefore, there is a substantial
unmet need to identify and successfully drug not only the drivers
but also the signaling pathways that are critical for the maintenance of the neoplastic phenotype. Furthermore, there is a need
for therapeutic depth in these critical pathways to overcome

Notch–ligand interactions or small-molecule inhibition of the
presenilin-dependent g-secretase (g-secretase inhibitors, GSI;
refs. 15–21). Both of these approaches serve to block liganddependent production of NICD, acting at the top of the Notch
signaling cascade. Alternatively, truncated forms of Maml1 have
been demonstrated to act in a dominant negative manner in the
Notch pathway (13, 22–26). Along these lines, Moellering and
colleagues designed and synthesized a peptide derived from
Maml1, termed SAHM1 (stapled a-helical peptide derived from
Maml1), which competes with Maml1 and inhibits the formation
of the NTC (27). Therefore, SAHM1 functions as a dominant
negative inhibitor (27). Although this approach worked at a scale
feasible for mouse studies, the use of peptides as therapeutics still
face signiﬁcant challenges, whereas small-molecule inhibitors represent a more desirable approach for cancer therapeutics. However,
to date there are no small-molecule inhibitors of the transcriptional
activation complex or that are speciﬁc to the Notch pathway itself.
Herein, we present proof-of-concept for a ﬁrst-in-class inhibitor
of the Notch transcriptional activation complex. We describe the
identiﬁcation and validation of a small-molecule inhibitor of
Mastermind recruitment-1 (IMR-1) to the Notch transcriptional
activation complex. We demonstrate that IMR-1 prevents the
recruitment of Maml1 to the NTC on chromatin, inhibits Notch
target gene transcription, and dramatically inhibits tumor growth
in a patient-derived tumor xenograft model.

Abcam, 18184). Streptavidin-conjugated donor beads (Perkin
Elmer) were used to bind the DS oligonucleotide and ProteinA–conjugated acceptor beads (Perkin Elmer) to detect antibodycoated proteins. NTC components were added to wells containing
the small molecules to be assayed and incubated for 30 minutes.
Acceptor beads and the antibody speciﬁc for Maml1, Notch1, or
CSL were then added to the reaction mixture and incubated in the
dark for 30 minutes, followed by addition of the donor beads
and incubated in the dark for 1 hour. Assays were performed in
384-well plates in triplicate (AlphaScreen plate; Perkin Elmer).
Data analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software

signiﬁcant.

Results
Computer-aided drug design of CSL–Notch1 interface
inhibitors
Assembly of the Notch transcriptional activation complex is
thought to occur in a stepwise fashion (13, 28, 31, 32). The crystal
structure of the NTC (PDB ID: 2F8X) shows a protein–protein
interface between the ANK repeat domain of Notch1 and CSL that
could act as a binding site for small molecules. Notch1 and CSL
create a cleft required for stable Maml1 association to the

Inhibitor of Mastermind Recruitment

complex. Once bound, Maml1 locks the core scaffold together
and serves to recruit the higher order transcription regulatory
machinery, thereby initiating the expression of Notch target genes
(12, 28, 33). We reasoned that CSL–Notch1 interactions could be
disrupted upon small-molecule binding, thus preventing Maml1
recruitment and leading to inhibition of NTC assembly. Because
Maml1 is critical to Notch activity (27), compounds that prevent
Maml1 recruitment would potentially inhibit Notch transcriptional activation. Therefore, to identify compounds that could
inhibit the NTC assembly, we performed in silico analysis of the
NTC structure to obtain structural variability for the initial screening of a large database of small molecules. We utilized eight
representative structures of the NTC core complex that were
generated using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and the
X-ray crystallographic structure. Sites on the NTC were evaluated
by docking 1,000 chemically distinct probe molecules and calculating the binding response (BR) score, which is based on
energetic and geometric criteria (34). A common site on the ANK
repeat domain of Notch1 was identiﬁed on seven of the MD
conformations and the crystal conformation, yielding a total of
eight conformations for screening. This site is composed of
residues that span the fourth through seventh ankyrin repeats of
Notch1. Primary in silico screening of this pocket was performed
on an in-house database (>1.5 million commercially available
drug-like small molecules). Each ligand was docked into the
putative binding site for each protein conformation using the
program DOCK (35) and a score was assigned on the basis of the
most favorable normalized van der Waals (vdW) attractive energy
among all the protein conformations. A secondary screening of
the top 50,000 molecules selected from the primary screens
involved more rigorous optimization during docking. Each compound was docked individually against each of the eight protein
conformations with the most favorable normalized total interaction energy over all the conformations taken as the score for each
compound. The top scoring 1,000 compounds were selected. The
ﬁnal compounds for experimental evaluation were chosen based
on their chemical diversity to maximize the possibility of identifying unique leads for further optimization and development
and on their physicochemical properties to maximize their potential bioavailability (36). We selected 150 compounds that were
obtained from commercial vendors for testing.
Development of a Notch ternary complex assembly assay
We developed an in vitro assay that quantitatively measures the
assembly of the NTC on DNA to screen for compounds that could
inhibit NTC formation. Brieﬂy, baculovirus-produced CSL,
Notch1, and Maml1 are used to build the NTC on a biotinylated
oligonucleotide scaffold that harbors a CSL binding site. A
Maml1-speciﬁc antibody is used to detect recruitment of Maml1
to the complex on DNA and complex formation is then detected
with the proximity-based AlphaScreen technology (Perkin Elmer)
using streptavidin donor and protein A acceptor beads (Fig. 1A).
Therefore, a signal should only be generated when Maml1 is
recruited to CSL on DNA. To demonstrate that the signal observed
resulted from the recruitment of Maml1 to the complex, Maml1
was titrated against a ﬁxed amount of the remaining reaction
components. A dose-dependent increase in signal was observed
upon Maml1 addition up to the stoichiometric equivalence point
(250 fmol, Fig. 1B, left). Similar results were observed upon
titration of Notch1 (Fig. 1B, right), indicating that recruitment
of Maml1 depends on Notch1 binding to CSL. Furthermore,

www.aacrjournals.org

complex assembly is dependent on CSL binding to DNA, because
an oligonucleotide that harbors a mutant CSL–binding site does
not generate an appreciable signal (Fig. 1C, shaded area).
To further authenticate the in vitro NTC assembly assay, we
probed different components and conditions to determine
whether the assay recapitulates established parameters of the NTC
on DNA. As previously described for Maml1 (Fig. 1B, left), a signal
is only observed when all components of the NTC are present in
the reaction (Fig. 1D, lanes 1–5). No signal is observed when
either CSL or Notch1 is absent from the reaction (Fig. 1D, lanes 6
and 7), indicating that binding of Maml1 to the complex requires
both CSL and Notch1. Furthermore, CSL binds to DNA in the
absence of the other NTC components (Fig. 1D, lanes 16–19),
whereas Notch1 requires CSL, but not Maml1, to bind to DNA
(Fig. 1D, lanes 11–13). We also tested the requirement of speciﬁc
protein domains (37). Deletion of the Notch RAM domain caused
a loss in the binding of both Notch1 and Maml1 to the complex
(Fig. 1D, lanes 9 and 15), whereas deletion of the Notch PEST
domain did not alter the assembly of the NTC (Fig. 1D, lanes 8 and
14). The results described here demonstrate that the assay measures the assembly of a bona ﬁde NTC, as the recruitment of Maml1
to the NTC is dependent on the high afﬁnity binding of Notch1 to
CSL through its RAM domain.

Screening of small-molecule inhibitors of the NTC led to the
identiﬁcation of IMR-1
The in vitro NTC assay was utilized to screen small molecules
derived from computer-aided drug design (CADD). From the 150
compounds tested, 30 compounds showed a decrease in Maml1
recruitment of at least 50% compared with the positive control
(all components of the NTC; Supplementary Fig. S1A). In particular, three compounds showed remarkable inhibitory activity
(>90%), and compound 1-134 inhibited assembly by 97% (Supplementary Fig. S1A, shaded area). To obtain structural variability
and validate these results, the scaffold of 1-134 was subjected to in
silico similarity search (38) using a virtual 2D database. Fifty-four
of the 1-134 derivative compounds were commercially available
and tested at 30 mmol/L. Only 16 compounds inhibited complex
assembly by more than 50% (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These
compounds were counter-screened against Notch1 and CSL antibodies using the in vitro NTC assembly assay to demonstrate their
speciﬁcity at displacing Maml1 from the complex. The data
indicate that the 1-134 derivatives did not displace CSL or Notch1
from the complex (Supplementary Fig. S1C, white bars and
striped bars, respectively). Therefore, the 1-134 derivatives speciﬁcally disrupt the binding of Maml1 to the NTC in vitro. To better
evaluate the potency of these compounds, the in vitro NTC assay
was used to generate dose–response curves and determine their
IC50.
The core molecular scaffold of 1-134 and its derivatives is a
thiazolidinone consisting of a phenyl ring and a rhodanine
moiety connected by a double bond. Dose–response curves of
1-134 and its 16 prioritized analogues indicated that the parent
compound 1-134 showed promising in vitro potency (IC50 ¼ 6
mmol/L) in the NTC assay. The rhodanine ester compound (1134-83, termed IMR-1) exhibited an IC50 of 26 mmol/L (Fig. 1E),
whereas the other compounds exhibited IC50 greater than 26
mmol/L (data not shown). Because ester containing compounds
may undergo hydrolysis in vivo by the action of several esterases
(39), we also tested the acid metabolite of IMR-1 (compound

(IC50 ¼ 0.5 mmol/L) with respect to IMR-1. Interestingly, removal
of the methoxy group of 1-134-2, corresponding to compound 1134-22 (Fig. 1E), leads to no inhibition of NTC formation as
evident by the large concentration of 1-134-22 required to observe
a small decrease in signal in the in vitro NTC assay (Fig. 1E). These
results also suggest a role of the methoxy group at this position in
binding to the target protein(s).
IMR-1 demonstrates noncovalent binding to Notch1 with
micromolar afﬁnity
To determine the afﬁnity of small-molecule inhibitors of the
NTC for Notch1 and characterize their molecular interactions, we
used surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Representative sensorgrams determined for the association of 1-134, IMR-1, and IMR1A to NICD are presented in Fig. 2A–C. The dissociation constants
associated with binding of the compounds to NICD was determined using the equilibrium approach by plotting the equilibrium response (Req) as a function of the compound concentration
and ﬁtting the data to a 1:1 binding model (Fig. 2D). Compound 1134 binds with moderate afﬁnity to NICD (KD ¼ 17  5 mmol/L).
A slightly higher afﬁnity was observed for IMR-1 (KD ¼11  3
mmol/L), whereas a signiﬁcantly higher afﬁnity to NICD was
observed for IMR-1A (KD ¼ 2.9  0.6 mmol/L). Noteworthy, the
SPR sensorgrams measured for association of 1-134, IMR-1, and
IMR-1A indicate noncovalent, reversible binding to Notch1 as

3596 Cancer Res; 76(12) June 15, 2016

evident by the dissociation curves reaching baseline upon introduction of buffer solution with a rate constant within the range of
small-molecule dissociation from proteins (Fig. 2A–C).
To obtain insight into the molecular interactions between IMR1 and the NTC and assessment of the binding site, we performed
molecular docking simulations of the inhibitors to the NTC (PDB
ﬁle: 2F8X). The data suggested that residues from ANK (R2096,
R2105, R2061, and R2071) were located within the binding
pocket. To determine the effect of each residue on the binding
of IMR-1 to Notch1, the afﬁnity of NTC inhibitors to wild-type
(WT) NICD and single-point mutated NICD (R2096A, R2105A,
R2061A, and R2071A) was determined by SPR. Replacement of
R2061 and R2071 with alanine decreases the afﬁnity of IMR-1 to
NICD by approximately ﬁvefold (KD of 35.6 and 38.7 mmol/L,
respectively; Fig. 2E). No effect was observed upon substitution of
R2096 and R2105 by alanine. These results suggest that R2061
and R2071 play an intimate role in the binding of IMR-1 to NICD.
Docking of IMR-1 to the NTC suggests that IMR-1 interacts with
Notch1 and CSL residues (Fig. 2F). CSL residues interacting with
IMR-1 include Q362, N363, G384, and M126. In addition, the
carbonyl group from the ester moiety of IMR-1 interacts with one
of the –NH groups from the side chain of R2061 from Notch1
through hydrogen bonding, consistent with the lower afﬁnity of
IMR-1 to R2061A (Fig. 2E). The docking model also suggests that
R2071 (Notch1) is located in close proximity to IMR-1 (Fig. 2F)
and may be involved in long-range interactions with IMR-1,

To determine whether these mutations affect the ability of Notch1
to form the NTC, we analyzed complex formation by DNA
pulldown and the in vitro NTC assay. DNA pulldown on CSL
oligonucleotide beads (Fig. 2G) and the NTC assay (Fig. 2H)
demonstrates mutated NICD proteins retain the ability to form
the ternary complex, as evident by the similar signal observed
between the WT and mutated NICD proteins.
IMR-1 inhibits Notch target gene transcription by disrupting
Maml1 recruitment to chromatin
Once we established that the CADD-derived compounds speciﬁcally disrupt the recruitment of Maml1 to the activation
complex in vitro, we sought to determine whether 1-134 and its
16 prioritized derivatives exhibit biologic activity using a cellbased assay. A colony formation assay was used a secondary
screening to test biologic activity. To this end, cell lines selected
for screening were classiﬁed into two groups based on their
sensitivity to DAPT (a GSI), to establish a criterion for Notch
dependence. We reasoned that inhibition of cell growth and gene
transcription by DAPT indicates speciﬁc inhibition of Notch
activity. Therefore, cell lines exhibiting inhibition of growth and

www.aacrjournals.org

transcription of Notch target genes upon treatment with DAPT
were classiﬁed as Notch dependent, whereas those in which
transcription and growth did not signiﬁcantly change upon DAPT
treatment were classiﬁed as Notch-independent cell lines. A
decrease in colony formation of Notch-dependent cell lines is
observed upon treatment with IMR-1 when compared with the
control (DMSO). However, no effect was observed for 1-134 and
its other derivatives up to concentrations of 30 to 45 mmol/L (data
not shown), likely due to low cell permeability. Therefore, IMR-1
was prioritized for further testing.
To determine the effect of IMR-1 treatment on the assembly of
the NTC in cells, Notch-dependent cell lines OE33 and 786-0 were
treated with DAPT or IMR-1. Treatment with DAPT decreased the
occupancy of Notch and Maml1 on the HES1 promoter using a
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay (Fig. 3A). This
effect is caused by a decrease in the NICD pool due to the
inhibition of presenilin-dependent g-secretase. Treatment of
OE33 and 786-0 with IMR-1 also decreased the occupancy of
Maml1 on the HES1 promoter but, in contrast to DAPT treatment,
IMR-1 treatment did not affect the occupancy of Notch1 on the
HES1 promoter (Fig. 3A). Western blot analysis of the lysates
demonstrates that IMR-1 treatment does not change the levels of

NICD in cells (Fig. 3A, right). Therefore, these data indicate that
IMR-1 speciﬁcally disrupts the recruitment of Maml1 to chromatin while the binding of NICD to CSL is unaffected. As IMR-1
treatment leads to disruption of the NTC on chromatin, we sought
to determine whether IMR-1 also abrogates Notch target gene
transcription (Fig. 3B). IMR-1–treated cells displayed a dosedependent decrease in Notch target gene transcription similar to
the control cells treated with DAPT. As proof of speciﬁcity,
transcription of the housekeeping gene HPRT was unaltered in
treated cells. To test the effects of Notch inhibition on proliferation, we performed a colony formation assay. Treatment of cells
with IMR-1 displayed a dose-dependent reduction in colony
formation in both 786-0 and OE33 cell lines (Fig. 3C). To extend
the analysis of tumor cell growth inhibition, we selected several
commonly used cancer cell lines to test for sensitivity to IMR-1
(Fig. 4A). The sensitivity proﬁle for cells treated with either IMR-1
or DAPT was comparable, indicating that IMR-1 is speciﬁcally
inhibiting Notch activity (Fig. 4A). Colony formation displayed a
similar stratiﬁcation, that is, cells with transcriptional sensitivity

3598 Cancer Res; 76(12) June 15, 2016

to IMR-1 and DAPT treatment exhibited impaired colony-forming
ability (Fig. 4B). Cells that are refractory to DAPT were equally
resistant to IMR-1. Taken together, these data indicate that IMR-1
selectively affect Notch-dependent cell lines via the inhibition of
Notch-directed transcriptional activation by blocking the recruitment of Mam1 to the Notch transcriptional complex on
chromatin.
IMR-1 inhibits xenograft tumor growth
To determine the effect of IMR-1 on tumor formation in an
animal model of cancer, we utilized an established xenograft
model (40). When introduced into the ﬂank of a nude mouse, 5 
106 OE19 human esophageal adenocarcinoma cells readily form
tumors over the course of 4 weeks. Treatment of these mice with
15 mg/kg IMR-1 readily blocks tumor establishment. In contrast,
treatment with DMSO (control) had no effect on tumor growth
(Supplementary Fig. S2). IMR-1 treatment at 15 mg/kg caused no
observable adverse effects on the animal and body weight
remained constant throughout the treatment course

IMR-1 is a speciﬁc inhibitor of the Notch pathway. A, RT-qPCR analysis on Notch-dependent (left) and Notch-independent (right) cell lines. Notch dependence is
based on sensitivity to DAPT (a GSI). Relative expression of Notch target genes (Hes-1 and Hey-L) compared with control (HPRT) is shown. B, colony
formation assay on corresponding cell lines under indicated conditions compared with DMSO control.

(Supplementary Fig. S2). To further examine the effect of IMR-1
on established tumors, we utilized two independent patientderived esophageal adenocarcinoma xenograft (PDX) models.
Tumors were established in NSG mice to the size of 200 mm3
prior to the initiation of treatment. Mice were then dosed daily via
intraperitoneal injection with either IMR-1 (15 mg/kg) or DAPT
(20 mg/kg) and compared with DMSO (control). Treatment of
both PDX tumors with IMR-1 signiﬁcantly abrogated growth to a
similar level achieved with DAPT treatment (Fig. 5A and B),
without any signiﬁcant weight loss or other visible signs of adverse
effects in the treated animals (Supplementary Fig. S3). Following
24 days of treatment, tumors were harvested and Notch target
gene transcription was evaluated. These data demonstrate that
treatment with IMR-1 dramatically reduced the expression level of
the tested Notch target genes (Hes1, HeyL, and Notch3; Fig. 5C) in
both PDX models. Similar reductions in Notch transcription were
observed in DAPT-treated tumors (Fig. 5C, right). Therefore, these
data demonstrate that the small-molecule IMR-1 is an inhibitor of
the Notch transcriptional activation complex with demonstrated
efﬁcacy in xenograft tumor models.
IMR-1 is metabolized in vivo to its acid metabolite IMR-1A
In vitro studies indicate that compound IMR-1 is as a potential
lead candidate for a speciﬁc Notch pathway inhibitor. Therefore,

www.aacrjournals.org

we determined the plasma pharmacokinetic proﬁle associated
with IMR-1 treatment following single intravenous and intraperitoneal dose administration in male C57 BL/6 mice (Fig. 5D).
Treatment with IMR-1 did not induce any clinical signs in mice
through last sample withdrawal, as evidenced by their normal
appearance (data not shown). Following single intravenous and
intraperitoneal administration of IMR-1 to the mice at 2 and
100 mg/kg, respectively, no signal was detected in plasma corresponding to the m/z ratio of IMR-1 at any time point. However, a
signal corresponding to the m/z ratio of IMR-1A was present in
the spectra, thereby the pharmacokinetic parameters of IMR-1A
were determined on the basis of the parent dose (Fig. 5D) and
are listed in Table 1. Following a single intravenous administration of IMR-1 at 2 mg/kg, IMR-1A exhibited low systematic
plasma clearance (CL ¼ 7 mL/min/kg) with terminal elimination
half-life (T1/2) of 2.22 hours. The normal liver blood ﬂow in
mice is 90 mL/minute/kg. In addition, the Vss (volume of
distribution) was approximately 4-fold higher than the normal
volume of total body water (0.7 L/kg). After intraperitoneal
administration of IMR-1 at 100 mg/kg dose, plasma concentrations were quantiﬁable up to 24 hours with Tmax of 0.50 hours.
These results indicate that IMR-1 metabolizes in plasma and
its acid metabolite exhibits drug-like properties, suggesting that
IMR-1 (containing an ester moiety) acts as a prodrug for IMR-1A,

IMR-1 inhibits Notch-dependent somite development in
zebraﬁsh
The effects of IMR-1 in vivo were also investigated using D. rerio
(zebraﬁsh). Notch signaling plays a critical role in somite formation in developing vertebrate embryos, and changes in levels of
Notch signaling during development result in disruption of the

symmetric, bilaterally formed somites that can be readily
observed in the zebraﬁsh embryo (Fig. 5E and F; refs. 37,
41–43). Thus, disruption of somitogenesis in zebraﬁsh represents
a convenient dose-sensitive readout for Notch pathway stimulation or inhibition. The data indicate that injecting 100 pg hNotch1
mRNA results in defects in somitogenesis in 90% of the embryos
(compared to 0% disrupted embryos in control injected
animals; Fig. 5E). Disruption of somite formation was observed
in 69.7% of embryos soaked in 40 mmol/L IMR-1 (Fig. 5E),

consistent with alteration in Notch signaling. However, no effect
was observed in embryos soaked in DMSO vehicle (control; Fig.
5E and F). These results support the role of IMR-1 as a smallmolecule inhibitor of Notch signaling in vivo.

Discussion
Precision medicine will likely be combinatorial, as is the case
for the HIV paradigm of HAART, where "class action" combinations [targeting distinct viral proteins (classes) in combination]
serve to keep viral loads at a minimal level, whereas therapeutic
depth with respect to the targets improves durability (44–46).
Similarly, in cancer it is well accepted that there are distinct
"hallmarks" of cancer physiology and that a "class action"
approach may provide the best way forward for improved efﬁcacy
and durability in cancer treatment (47, 48). Therefore, there exists
an urgency to identify and develop novel therapeutics to provide a
comprehensive array of target-speciﬁc drugs.
There are several features of the Notch pathway mechanism that
make it an attractive target for cancer therapeutics. Therefore,
inhibition of complex assembly represents an attractive node for
therapeutic intervention. However, to date there are no smallmolecule inhibitors directly targeting the Notch intracellular
pathway, which could provide greater speciﬁcity for Notch pathway inhibition. To identify inhibitors of the Notch intracellular
pathway that directly target the NTC, we used CADD in combination with a novel in vitro assay that quantitatively measures the
formation of the NTC. Cell-based assays were used to screen
inhibitors with promising NTC inhibition effects and prioritize
compounds for further studies, which led to the identiﬁcation of
IMR-1 as a potential small-molecule inhibitor of the Notch
transcriptional activation complex. Herein, we demonstrate that
IMR-1 prevents the recruitment of Maml1, therefore uncoupling
the Notch-mediated transcriptional cascade in response to
activation.
A range of experimental data indicates that IMR-1 is a bona ﬁde
candidate for consideration as an antineoplastic agent that targets
Notch. The compound speciﬁcally inhibits the binding of Maml1
to the DNA-bound complex, selectively inhibits cell growth in cell
lines that are dependent on Notch signaling for viability and
affects transcription in Notch target genes, indicating IMR-1 acts
on the Notch pathway through on-target effects. Furthermore,
ChIP data suggest that IMR-1 functions with a mode of action
distinct from the GSI DAPT to block Maml1 recruitment to the
NTC. Speciﬁc inhibition of Notch-dependent activity also occurs
in vivo. The plasma pharmacokinetic proﬁle upon treatment with
IMR-1 (ester) and the 50-fold higher potency observed for IMR-1A
(acid metabolite of IMR-1) with respect to IMR-1 suggest that
IMR-1 acts as a prodrug of IMR-1A. The ester moiety is commonly
used in medicinal chemistry for the design of prodrugs to increase
lipophilicity of polar or ionizable functionalities, such as carboxyl
groups, resulting in increased cell permeability of the drug (49,
50). Furthermore, SPR data demonstrate that two arginine residues (R2061 and R2071) found in the ANK domain of Notch1
mediate binding between IMR-1 and Notch1, which conﬁrms
binding to the target and the critical importance of these two
arginine residues.
The core molecular scaffold of compound IMR-1 is a thiazolidinone. Thiazolidinones are heterocyclic compounds that contain a rhodanine moiety. Many thiazolidinones have had success
in the clinic. However, there are perceived liabilities related to the

www.aacrjournals.org

rhodanine moiety in drug discovery and development because
rhodanines may lead to nonspeciﬁc interactions because of its
potential reactivity, thus rhodanines have been referred as panassay interference (PAIN) molecules (51, 52). Although there is a
general concern about the potential promiscuity and reactivity of
this moiety, many studies have suggested that these concerns are
more relevant at screening concentrations and that a comprehensive characterization of their interaction with the target should be
performed, including biophysical characterization before prioritizing such compounds (53). Given the speciﬁcity of IMR-1
observed experimentally, we conclude that issues related with
reactivity and nonspeciﬁc effects are not occurring since: (i) The
data indicate that not all IMR-1 analogues (containing a rhodanine moiety), inhibit assembly of the NTC as exempliﬁed by
inactive compounds exhibiting no effect in the in vitro NTC assay
(i.e., compound 1-134-22). (ii) SPR data demonstrate reversible
(noncovalent) binding of IMR-1 to Notch1, and a similar proﬁle
was observed for its analogues. (iii) IMR-1 show speciﬁcity for
Notch target genes and (iv) no general toxicity was observed upon
in vivo treatment with IMR-1.
In summary, this study provides proof-of-principle for targeting the Notch transcriptional activation complex to inhibit Notch
activity and presents a novel class of Notch inhibitors with the
potential to be developed into therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer. This class of inhibitors may fulﬁll an unmet need
in terms of therapeutic agents targeting the Notch signaling
pathway, providing speciﬁc inhibition of the Notch transcriptional activation complex, which could complement and/or offer
an alternative to current therapeutic approaches and therefore
fulﬁll a basic tenet of the precision medicine strategy.
