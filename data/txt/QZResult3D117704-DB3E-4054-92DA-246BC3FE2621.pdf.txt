Abstract
Despite the high mortality from metastatic cancer, therapeutic targets to prevent metastasis are limited. Efforts to identify
genetic aberrations that predispose tumors to metastasis have
been mostly unsuccessful. To understand the nature of candidate targets for metastatic disease, we performed an in silico
screen to identify drugs that can inhibit a gene expression
signature associated with epithelial–mesenchymal transition
(EMT). Compounds discovered through this method, including those previously identiﬁed, appeared to restrict metastatic
capacity through a common mechanism, the ability to modulate the ﬂuidity of cell membranes. Treatment of breast cancer
cell lines with the putative antimetastasis agents reduced membrane ﬂuidity, resulting in decreased cell motility, stem cell–
like properties, and EMT in vitro, and the drugs also inhibited

spontaneous metastasis in vivo. When ﬂuidity was unchanged,
the antimetastasis compounds could no longer restrict metastasis, indicating a causal association between ﬂuidity and
metastasis. We further demonstrate that ﬂuidity can be regulated by cellular cholesterol ﬂux, as the cholesterol efﬂux
channel ABCA1 potentiated metastatic behaviors in vitro and
in vivo. The requirement for ﬂuidity was further supported by
the ﬁnding in breast cancer patients that ABCA1 was overexpressed in 41% of metastatic tumors, reducing time to
metastasis by 9 years. Collectively, our ﬁndings reveal increased
membrane ﬂuidity as a necessary cellular feature of metastatic
potential that can be controlled by many currently available
drugs, offering a viable therapeutic opportunity to prevent
cancer metastasis. Cancer Res; 76(7); 2037–49. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

therapeutic strategies. A model that explains the acquisition of
metastatic traits using a more limited set of targetable cellular events
would help in the development of broadly applicable treatments.
Despite the wealth of signals known to promote metastasis, the
search for small molecules to target this fatal process has been
hampered by a lack of knowledge of a targetable addiction of
metastatic cells. Efforts to identify genetic alterations that predispose tumors to metastasis have thus far been unsuccessful (7). To
address this deﬁciency, unbiased in vitro screens for drugs have
focused on the stem cell phenotype because metastasis requires
the ability to recapitulate a primary tumor in a distant site with the
same hierarchy of cell types. Recent screens against stem cells have
identiﬁed two leading candidates, salinomycin, a potassium
channel ionophore; and thioridazine, a dopamine receptor antagonist (8, 9). In both cases, their primary targets have little known
bearing on the known biology of metastasis. However, salinomycin has later been shown to inhibit Wnt signaling through an
unknown mechanism dependent upon a transmembrane receptor (10). For thioridazine, an association between dopamine
receptor activation and stem cells was originally suggested, but
an independent screen recovered both dopamine receptor agonists and antagonists, suggesting that the compound likely works
through an alternative mechanism (11). Given these results, the
only apparent similarity in targets is the dependence upon membrane associated receptors. The lack of a deeper explanation for
how these compounds work reveals a limitation in our understanding of the important determinants of metastatic capacity.
To better understand the targets and dependencies of metastasis, our study demonstrates that the ﬂuidity of cell membranes,
whether changed by pharmacologic or genetic inducers, controls

To metastasize, a cancer cell must acquire a set of capabilities that
are distinct from and potentially incompatible with its ability to
ﬂourish in the primary tumor (1). One explanation for how cells
can acquire metastatic capacity is that they activate a latent epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) program, which provides cancer cells with increased motility and stem cell properties (2, 3).
Regardless of mechanism, the diversity of signals that can activate
the metastatic cascade (4–6) poses a challenge in developing

metastatic capacity. Decreasing ﬂuidity prevents and reverses an
EMT and inhibits metastasis in mouse models. In human breast
cancers, overexpression of ABCA1, a regulator of membrane
cholesterol and ﬂuidity, is associated with increased metastasis.
Taken together, these disparate lines of evidence indicate that
membrane ﬂuidity is a critical determinant of metastatic capacity
and suggest that it may be a viable therapeutic target.

Results
An in silico phenotype screen predicts small molecules that
repress metastatic capacity
We searched for compounds that can repress a metastatic
phenotype (i.e., the set of cellular characteristics associated with
metastasis), even if they do not lead to death as in prior screens (8,
9), using an EMT gene expression signature as a model (Fig. 1A).
We created a signature based on embryonic development using an
approach we previously described (12), although other signatures
have been developed (13, 14). Noticing that EMT inducers
TWIST1 and ZEB1 (6, 15) are upregulated at day 9.5 (Supplementary Fig. S1A), we selected for our signature the 219 genes that
are either induced or repressed at this time (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Table S1). We found that the scores from this signature are
signiﬁcantly higher in cells after undergoing an EMT (across 6gene expression data sets; Fig. 1C). To further characterize the
signature, we performed pathway analysis using GATHER (16)
and found 67 signiﬁcant processes (FDR < 0.05), including many
associated with differentiation, development, and motility (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We also generated a network of the altered
pathways (17–19) and saw that the signature is associated with
upregulation of Wnt signaling, which is an inducer of Snail and
EMT (Supplementary Fig. S1C; ref. 20). These results indicate that
our EMT signature captures the distinction between the epithelial
and mesenchymal phenotypes in cancer.

Membrane Fluidity Controls Metastasis

With the validated EMT signature, we identiﬁed drugs that can
perturb it using the Connectivity Map, a database of gene expression changes triggered by pharmacologic compounds (Fig. 1D;
ref. 21). Analysis of 1,309 compounds, including FDA-approved
drugs and other bioactive molecules, yielded predictions of drugs
that repress an EMT gene expression signature (antimetastasis
drugs) (Fig. 1E; Supplementary Table S2). The top scoring antimetastasis drugs are inhibitors of known EMT pathways, such as
vimentin expression (withaferin A; ref. 22), HDAC dependency
(vorinostat, trichostatin A; ref. 23), HSP90 response (tanespimycin, geldanamycin; ref. 24), or PI3K activation (LY294002; ref. 25).
Furthermore, one of the compounds identiﬁed in a prior screen,
thioridazine, is also predicted to be antimetastasis. The other,
salinomycin, was not proﬁled in this database. To validate the
robustness of the results, we found a statistically signiﬁcant
overlap (P ¼ 0.0004) with the connectivity scores obtained using
a previously published EMT signature (13). All but thioridazine
were conﬁrmed by the core EMT signature to be antimetastatic (P
¼ 0.007; Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Predicted antimetastasis drugs inhibit cell motility,
mammosphere formation, and the EMT
To test whether the drugs predicted in silico can alter metastatic
phenotypes in vitro, we focused on four with a range of mechanisms: alprostadil (prostaglandin agonist), amitriptyline (tricyclic
antidepressant), haloperidol (dopamine receptor antagonist),
and maprotiline (tetracyclic antidepressant); as well as two previously identiﬁed drugs, salinomycin and thioridazine.
To validate whether the predicted drugs can affect metastatic
capacity, we tested whether they impact cell motility or mammosphere formation, cellular characteristics that are necessary for
metastasis. To measure motility, we performed transwell migration and wound healing assays and found that the drugs significantly decreased the motility of cells (Fig. 2A–C and Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). In addition, the drugs could also repress the
ability of the cells to form mammospheres, an in vitro assay for
early progenitor stem cell characteristics in breast cancer cells (Fig.
2D and Supplementary Fig. S2D; ref. 26). The drug concentrations
used varied from 1 to 20 mmol/L (see Supplementary Materials
and Methods).
To evaluate whether the assays were confounded by an impact
on cell proliferation or death, we measured the impact of the drugs
on cell number. At seven days, the maximum duration of the prior
assays, drug treatment minimally impacted the cells, leading to a
17% to 18% decrease that cannot explain the magnitude of the
changes in the metastatic phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. S2E).
One exception is alprostadil, which showed a maximum of 50%
decrease (one cell division) at seven days. However, even this drug
had no impact after one day, indicating that the changes in the
short term motility assays also cannot be explained by a change in
cell number.
The prior experiments demonstrated that antimetastasis drugs
could decrease metastatic phenotypes. However, in tumors, a
metastatic phenotype may be maintained by signaling sustained
via genetic or epigenetic changes or from extracellular sources. To
see whether the target of the drugs is dominant over the presence
of a continuous metastasis-inducing signal, we next tested whether antimetastasis drugs can reverse an EMT in cells that have
undergone the transition or prevent cells from entering one. For
the ﬁrst experiment, we used HMLE cells (nontumorigenic
immortalized human mammary epithelial cells; ref. 27) that

www.aacrjournals.org

stably express Twist, which forced the cells to undergo an EMT
as seen by loss of the E-cadherin epithelial marker and gain of
mesenchymal ones (Fig. 2E and F). In these cells, ﬁve days of
antimetastasis drug treatment resulted in reassertion of E-cadherin and loss of mesenchymal markers, even under continued
Twist expression, showing that the cells reverted to an epithelial
state despite continued expression of a potent EMT inducer.
To test whether the drugs can prevent an EMT, we used an
inducible EMT system comprised of HMLE cells carrying tamoxifen-inducible Twist (2). We treated cells with antimetastasis
drugs for seven days and then activated Twist with tamoxifen.
While untreated cells underwent an EMT, cells treated with antimetastasis drugs did not undergo the same change (Fig. 2G). This
shows that antimetastasis drugs can prevent the EMT despite the
presence of an EMT-inducing signal. We conﬁrmed that a stem cell
phenotype was also reverted in a mammosphere assay (Fig. 2H
and I). Similar results could also be seen in T47D cells using the
EMT inducer Snail (Supplementary Fig. S2F and S2G).
Taken together, these experiments demonstrate that drugs with
a broad range of established targets can inhibit both metastatic
phenotypes and EMT across a range of breast cancer cell lines
(T47D, nonmetastatic, luminal; MCF7, nonmetastatic, luminal;
MDA-MB-231, metastatic, claudin low; and SUM-159, metastatic,
claudin low; ref. 28). Combined with the observation that they
can inhibit an EMT, it suggests that they affect a target that is
necessary for an EMT but also has a general capacity to tune
metastatic phenotypes across cell states.
Antimetastasis drugs reduce plasma membrane ﬂuidity
Due to the large number of pathways and the breadth of drugs
that can reduce metastatic phenotypes, we surmised that they may
be controlled by a broad cellular characteristic. To identify it, we
examined the drugs found in our in silico screen and noticed a
strong correlation between the induction of an EMT signature and
a reported ability to alter plasma membrane ﬂuidity (deﬁned as
the rate that a molecule can diffuse laterally across the
membrane; Fig. 3A). This mechanism is supported by prior
studies showing that cell lines from lung (29), sarcoma (30), and
breast tumors (31) that metastasize have higher ﬂuidity. On the
basis of these results, we asked whether the observed ﬂuidity
change is a correlated byproduct of, or a requirement for, EMT and
metastasis.
To test whether our predicted antimetastasis drugs can alter
plasma membrane ﬂuidity, we used a FRAP assay (Fig. 3B). After
treating cells, we found that haloperidol decreases the ﬂuidity of
the plasma membrane (Fig. 3C), showing a lower number of
mobile molecules as well as a decreased rate of diffusion (Fig. 3D).
To test a broader range of molecules, we switched to a more
tractable pyrene ﬂuidity assay. As a control, we included oleic acid,
an 18-chain monounsaturated fatty acid that ﬂuidizes membranes by disrupting lipid packing (32). Using this approach, we
conﬁrmed that EMT inducers and oleic acid increase ﬂuidity,
whereas antimetastasis drugs decrease it across a range of cell
lines (Fig. 3E; Supplementary Fig. S3A).
The prior experiments were performed in a monolayer culture
that lacks the 3D organization of the in vivo state, which has been
seen to alter the response of cells to drugs such as chemotherapies
(33). Therefore, to determine whether 3D organization impacts
the ability of drugs to alter ﬂuidity, we cultured MDA-MB-231 and
T47D cells in 3D, where they assumed stellate (characterized by
invasive projections) and mass (with disorganized nuclei and

Membrane Fluidity Controls Metastasis

robust cell–cell adhesions) morphologies, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3B; ref. 34). Although cells in 3D culture exhibit
higher ﬂuidity than in 2D, the drugs could nevertheless reduce
ﬂuidity similar to that seen in 2D (Fig. 3F and G and Supplementary Fig. S3C and S3D).
Next, to distinguish whether ﬂuidity is correlated with, or
causally represses, metastatic phenotypes, we isolated the molecular targets of the drugs from ﬂuidity by treating cells concurrently
with both an antimetastasis drug (that decreases ﬂuidity) and
oleic acid (that increases ﬂuidity), resulting in no net change (Fig.
3H and Supplementary Fig. S3E). When ﬂuidity was unchanged,
antimetastasis drugs could no longer decrease either cell migration or mammosphere formation in MDA-MB-231 or T47D cells
(Fig. 3I and J and Supplementary Fig. S3F and S3G). This demonstrates that antimetastasis drugs decrease metastatic phenotypes
through a ﬂuidity-dependent mechanism.
Antimetastasis drugs decrease membrane ﬂuidity and prevent
metastasis in vivo
Metastasis is comprised of complex physiologic events that are
not present in vitro, including inﬂuences from the microenvironment and immune system. To model these factors, we tested our
antimetastasis drugs in a syngeneic immunocompetent mouse
model of metastasis. We injected 4T1 cells orthotopically into the
mammary fat pads, a model of the stroma of normal mammary
glands, of BALB/c mice. Once a day, we injected mice intraperitoneally with saline, alprostadil, or haloperidol at doses analogous to those given to humans clinically. To isolate ﬂuidity from
other targets of the drugs, we also treated with a combination of
the drugs and oleic acid. During the course of the experiment, all
mice developed primary tumors in the mammary gland and were
sacriﬁced after 31 days. The haloperidol-treated mice exhibited
lethargy, a well-known side effect of the drug, immediately after
injections, which diminished over the next hours, while the
alprostadil-treated mice showed no obvious changes in behavior
or weight. The sizes of the primary tumors were similar across all
groups, indicating that the drugs had little or no impact on tumor
growth (Fig. 4A). However, the ﬂuidity of the tumors treated with
drugs decreased, showing that the drugs affected the tumors,
except when balanced by oleic acid injections (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, drug treatment led to signiﬁcantly fewer metastatic nodules
on the surface of the lung, which was reversed when ﬂuidity was
restored with oleic acid (Fig. 4C and D). The tumors treated with
oleic acid showed an increased number of nodules that did not
achieve statistical signiﬁcance. However, half these lungs were
permeated with metastatic growth such that nodules could not be
counted accurately, exceeding the limits of the assay. To more
sensitively measure tumor burden, we sectioned the lungs, stained
with hematoxylin and eosin, and calculated the metastatic burden

as the fraction of cells that were cancerous. This revealed that oleic
acid does signiﬁcantly increase metastatic burden (Fig. 4E and F).
Finally, to check if the antimetastasis drugs can affect the mesenchymal status of the tumors, we stained for the expression of
vimentin, revealing that the antimetastasis drugs resulted in
tumors with decreased vimentin expression, while oleic acid had
the opposite effect (Fig. 4G and H). Taken together, these results
demonstrate that antimetastasis drugs signiﬁcantly reduced breast
cancer metastasis, dependent upon a decrease in the membrane
ﬂuidity of the primary tumor.
Cellular cholesterol alters membrane ﬂuidity and metastatic
phenotypes
As a more ﬂuid membrane is required for metastasis, we
reasoned that metastatic tumor cells must somehow increase
their ﬂuidity. One possible mechanism is an alteration in
cellular cholesterol, a determinant of membrane ﬂuidity
(35), which we conﬁrmed by titrating cholesterol in MDAMB-231 cells (Fig. 5A and B). We treated MDA-MB-231 cells
with our antimetastasis drugs and found that they increased
cholesterol levels (Fig. 5C), consistent with the decrease in
ﬂuidity. Furthermore, cholesterol also leads to a loss of metastatic phenotypes, as measured by migration and mammosphere formation (Fig. 5D–G). Indeed, the total cellular cholesterol levels are inversely correlated with membrane ﬂuidity
and metastatic phenotypes.
The cholesterol efﬂux channel ABCA1 drives metastasis in
human breast cancer
As cholesterol is a potent inhibitor of metastatic phenotypes,
we predicted that the EMT program may increase metastatic
capacity by reducing cholesterol. To identify this mechanism, we
searched for changes in the expression of genes that control
cellular cholesterol levels across an EMT (36). This bioinformatic
analysis revealed that an ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCA1,
which functions as a cholesterol reverse transporter (37), is
signiﬁcantly upregulated in an EMT (Fig. 6A). To conﬁrm this,
we expressed Snail or Twist in HMLE cells and a range of luminal
breast cancer cell lines and measured ABCA1 gene expression. In
these conditions, the expression of ABCA1 was increased 4- to 12fold (Fig. 6B).
As a potential mechanism to explain their activity, we tested
whether the antimetastasis drugs reduce ABCA1 expression. We
treated T47D cells induced to undergo an EMT and MDA-MB-231
cells with a range of antimetastasis drugs and found that ABCA1
gene and protein expression was signiﬁcantly decreased (Fig. 6C
and D). Further, in sections from lung metastases, the tumors
from mice treated with antimetastasis drugs had signiﬁcantly
fewer cells with high ABCA1 expression (Fig. 6E and F). Thus,

ABCA1 is an EMT-responsive gene that can be inhibited by the
treatment of antimetastasis drugs.
Although ABCA1 was previously found to decrease cell
proliferation, its relationship with metastasis is still unknown
(38). To determine whether ABCA1-regulated cholesterol levels
control metastatic capacity, we used an RNAi strategy and
knocked down ABCA1 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S4A). This led to an increase in cellular free cholesterol,
consistent with a diminished ability of the cells to efﬂux
cholesterol (Fig. 7A). The cholesterol levels were also inversely
correlated with changes in membrane ﬂuidity (Fig. 7B). We
measured cell proliferation for one week and observed no
change (Supplementary Fig. S4B). As our model would predict,
we also observed in these cells a decreased cell motility (Fig. 7C
and D and Supplementary Fig. S4C). In each of these experiments, we could rescue the phenotype by restoring cellular

cholesterol with MbCD, a compound that extracts cholesterol
from cell membranes (39). This demonstrates that the changes
in phenotype were dependent upon its impact on cholesterol
and not another function of ABCA1. Taken together, these
results show that ABCA1 determines cell migration through
the regulation of cholesterol levels.
Seeing that knockdown of ABCA1 can alter metastatic phenotypes, we next tested whether cyclosporin A, an ABCA1 inhibitor,
has similar effects (40). Treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with this
compound led to a signiﬁcant increase in cellular cholesterol
concomitant with a reduction in ﬂuidity (Supplementary Fig. S4D
and S4E). Consistent with this result, we also observed a decrease
in migration and mammosphere formation (Supplementary Fig.
S4F–S4H). Finally, we tested whether cyclosporin A can inhibit an
EMT in a T47D model. We induced an EMT by ectopic expression
of Snail, and found that it can restore epithelial transcriptional

markers, along with a reduction in mammosphere-forming
ability (Supplementary Fig. S4I and S4J). These results conﬁrm
that the inhibition of ABCA1 function decreases metastatic
phenotypes.
Having seen the importance of ABCA1 in vitro, we tested
whether it drives metastasis in vivo. We injected the control and
MDA-MB-231/shABCA1 cells (with two different shRNAs) into
the tail veins of immunocompromised NOD/SCID mice and
sacriﬁced them after 49 days. We stained the lungs for expression of ABCA1 and conﬁrmed that the tumors from ABCA1
knockdown had lower ABCA1 expression (Supplementary Fig.
S5A and S5B). At that time, they had signiﬁcantly more metastatic nodules both on the surface (Fig. 7E and F) and in the
interior of the lungs (Fig. 7G). To check the growth rate of the
cells in vivo, we injected MDA-MB-231/control and MDA-MB231/shABCA1-3 cells orthotopically into the mammary fat
pads of NOD/SCID mice and saw no difference in the size of
the resultant tumors, in contrast to a prior report, potentially
because in the prior study, ABCA1 was ectopically overexpressed in a genetic background, where it promotes apoptosis
(Supplementary Fig. S5C; ref. 38). In any case, our results
demonstrate that ABCA1 signiﬁcantly enhances metastatic colonization in vivo.
Given that ABCA1 is expressed during EMT and can drive
metastatic properties in vitro and metastasis in vivo, we predicted that it may be a mechanism used by human tumors to
increase metastatic capacity. To test this, we examined ABCA1
expression across four publicly available datasets of breast
cancer patients that were monitored for distant metastases
(Supplementary Fig. S5D). Among tumors that metastasized
within ﬁve years, 41%28% had high ABCA1 expression (Fig.
7H). Those patients acquired metastases signiﬁcantly earlier
than those with normal ABCA1 expression. The time required
for 25% of the tumors to metastasize was 94 years shorter
when ABCA1 was high. Hundred percent of patients with high
ABCA1 had metastases by 12.5 years, compared with only 28%
of patients with normal ABCA1. The strong association
between ABCA1 and distant metastases in human breast cancers, coupled with the preclinical evidence revealing the mechanism, shows that ABCA1 is a potent inducer of metastatic
capacity in human breast cancers. This demonstrates a novel
strategy for human tumors to acquire metastatic capacity,
namely the regulation of ﬂuidity through alteration in cellular
cholesterol homeostasis.

Discussion
Our investigations revealed that membrane ﬂuidity is causally associated with metastasis, provides a mechanism that
explains the efﬁcacy of previously and newly identiﬁed antimetastasis drugs, and shows that breast tumors have altered
cholesterol efﬂux associated with metastasis (Fig. 7I). The fact
that the efﬁcacy of antimetastasis drugs depends on their ability
to reduce ﬂuidity enables the search for more potent
therapeutics.
The unexpected alterations of cholesterol efﬂux in breast
cancer raise the possibility that systemic cholesterol levels may
affect metastasis. This question has been addressed with epidemiologic studies starting 85 years ago with the observation
that cancer patients have less heart diseases, initiating investigations that continue almost a century later (41). A range of

www.aacrjournals.org

studies found a correlation between low levels of plasma
cholesterol and increased mortality from cancer, although a
minority saw no signiﬁcant effect (Supplementary Table S3).
One explanation for the correlation is that some patients may
harbor undiagnosed tumors that are metabolizing cholesterol,
leading to lower plasma cholesterol levels (42). This is supported by data showing that cholesterol and its metabolites
can promote tumor initiation (43). However, even after controlling for this by lag-time analyses, the association remains.
The conﬂicting interpretations of the association between cholesterol and cancer suggest a complex relationship between cholesterol and disease that is not yet fully understood. As cholesterol
affects tumor initiation, proliferation, and metastasis through a
range of mechanisms, it is likely that cholesterol plays both
promoting and inhibiting roles throughout tumor development.
To better understand it, studies must be carried out that carefully
isolate the contribution of cholesterol to different hallmarks of the
cancer phenotype. This study reveals the impact of ﬂuidity and
cholesterol speciﬁcally on metastasis. While cells may utilize
ABCA1 to promote metastasis, the same gene may also inhibit
the development of tumors by inhibiting cellular proliferation
(38). Similarly, as inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis, one would
predict that statins would promote metastasis. However, the
literature on statins is ambiguous, showing both tumorigenic
and antitumorigenic effects, potentially due to pleiotropic effects
of the drug.
Finally, the ability of ﬂuidity to inhibit metastasis has implications for therapy. Nearly all the antimetastasis drugs we identiﬁed
are FDA approved. These drugs were able to reduce the ﬂuidity of
primary tumors and decrease metastatic capacity in vivo at dosages
analogous to those given to humans with no obvious additional
systemic toxicity. However, this raises questions regarding the
impact of long-term nonspeciﬁc decrease of ﬂuidity across an
organism. Suggesting that the treatment is not evidently toxic is
the fact that one of the drugs, haloperidol, is used to treat chronic
psychiatric disorders. Thus, the apparent wealth in available drugs
that can affect membrane ﬂuidity, observed by others and ourselves, suggests that a viable antimetastatic therapy may already
exist.
