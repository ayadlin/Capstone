ABSTRACT
Prolactinomas are the most prevalent functional pituitary adenomas. The
preferred treatments for prolactinomas are dopamine agonists (DAs) such as
bromocriptine (BRC), but DAs still have the challenges of tumor recurrence and drug
resistance. This study demonstrates that the synergy of function and mechanism
between artesunate (ART) and BRC inhibits prolactinoma cell growth in vitro. We
found that low-dose ART combined with BRC synergistically inhibited the growth of
GH3 and MMQ cell lines, caused cell death, attenuated cell migration and invasion,
and suppressed the expression of extracellular prolactin. The induction of apoptosis
after co-treatment was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining, assessment
of caspase-3 protein expression, and flow cytometry. Expression of miR-200c, a
carcinogenic factor in pituitary adenoma, was reduced following co-treatment with
ART and BRC. This was accompanied by increased expression of the antitumor factor
Pten. Transfection experiments with miR-200c analogs and inhibitors confirmed that
miR-200c expression was inversely associated with Pten expression. We suggest that
ART and BRC used in combination exert synergistic apoptotic and antitumor effects
by suppressing miR-200c and stimulating Pten expression.

increases dopamine levels in the brain and thus reduces
PRL secretion and tumor size. However, tumors have
been shown to recur after the withdrawal of DAs, and
DAs are associated with a dose-dependent increase in
the risk of cardiac valve regurgitation, along with the
induction of retroperitoneal and pulmonary fibrosis
[7–10] and an impaired quality of life. Moreover, single
chemotherapeutic agents can lose their potency over time
as a result of increased drug resistance [11].
Artesunate (ART), a natural sesquiterpene lactone
derivative of artemisinin, can be extracted from the
Chinese herb Artemisia annua, and is well established as
an effective antimalarial treatment [12]. Recently, ART was
reported to exhibit antitumor effects [13, 14]. We previously

INTRODUCTION
Hereditary genetic predisposition, endocrine
factors, and specific somatic mutations may contribute to
the development of pituitary adenomas. These common
neuroendocrine neoplasms occur in almost 20% of the
general population, and mainly cause compression and
hormonal hypersecretion [1–5]. At autopsy, the incidence
of pituitary adenoma reached 27% [6].
Currently, dopamine agonists (DAs) and
somatostatin analogs are well-established treatments
to suppress prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone (GH)
hypersecretion [7]. Bromocriptine (BRC) is a DA that

demonstrated that ART inhibited pituitary adenoma cell
proliferation, induced apoptosis, and reduced hormone
synthesis and secretion [15, 16]. In the present study, we
used GH3 and MMQ pituitary cell lines to investigate
whether ART combined with BRC would have greater
antitumor effects than single therapy with BRC, or even
synergistically inhibit pituitary adenoma cell growth in vitro.
Our previous research also indicated that miR-200c
was differentially expressed in pituitary adenoma specimens
and MMQ cells, and that its expression likely contributed to
pituitary adenoma pathogenesis [17]. Previous studies have
demonstrated that the tumor suppressor gene phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN), was associated with miR200 in tumor progression [18, 19]. Therefore, we also
investigated whether miR-200c and its target gene Pten
were involved in the synergistic anticancer effects of ART
and BRC in pituitary adenoma GH3 and MMQ cell lines.

MMQ cells, treatment with 15 μM BRC or 2 μM ART
alone increased cell death by approximately 35%, whereas
combination treatment induced cell death by over 75% (p
= 0.01) (Figure 1D). A similar effect was observed in GH3
cells (p = 0.013). Thus, we demonstrated that co-treatment
of GH3 and MMQ cells with 2 μM ART and 15 μM BRC
synergistically inhibited proliferation and induced cell death.

Combined ART and BRC treatment arrested
pituitary adenoma cells in the G1 phase of the
cell cycle
To determine whether cell death induced by
combined BRC and ART treatment was associated with
antiproliferative effects caused by cell cycle disruption,
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) was performed
to assess the DNA content of GH3 and MMQ cells. ART
did not arrest the cell cycle in GH3 and MMQ cells at
the concentrations used, while BRC treatment slightly
extended the G1 phase in GH3 cells (p = 0.033) but not
in MMQ cells. ART and BRC in combination, however,
resulted in G1 phase blockage in both cell lines (Figure 2).
These cell cycle effects implied that combined treatment
might inhibit cell proliferation and thus induce apoptosis.

RESULTS
BRC and ART synergistically inhibited pituitary
adenoma cell growth and induced cell death
Treatment with ART (0–60 μM) or BRC (0–60 μM)
alone significantly reduced the viable GH3 and MMQ cell
numbers in a dose-dependent manner, as demonstrated
by an MTT assay (Figure 1A and 1B). Cytotoxicity in rat
pituitary cells (RPC) was also evaluated, and the results
indicated that ART had a higher growth-inhibitory effect
at various concentrations than BRC (Figure 1A and 1B).
The IC50 values of ART in GH3 and MMQ cells were
approximately 9.53 ± 4.12 μM and 18.37 ± 1.21 μM,
respectively, and were approximately 21.89 ± 1.31 μM
and 43.57 ± 3.31 μM for BRC.
Combined treatment with ART and BRC was
then assessed at concentrations of the drugs that, alone,
had little or no effect on viable cell numbers (Figure
1C). In GH3 and MMQ cell lines, 1 μM or 2 μM ART
did not reduce the number of viable pituitary adenoma
cells, whereas 15 μM BRC induced approximately 24%
inhibition (p = 0.01). The combination of ART (2 μM) and
BRC (15 μM) exhibited a synergistic effect and reduced
the GH3 viable cell number by approximately 75%
compared with controls (p = 0.002). This synergistic effect
was even more pronounced in MMQ cells, in which the
combination of 2 μM ART and 15 μM BRC reduced the
viable cell number by more than 75% (p = 0.001). Of note,
the combination of 1 μM ART and 15 μM BRC was less
effective than the combination of 2 μM ART and 15 μM
BRC (Figure 1C). Interestingly, the combined treatment
had little or no effect on RPCs, in which the viable cell
number remained greater than 80% (p = 0.87) (Figure 1C).
To determine whether the synergistic effects of ART
and BRC observed in pituitary adenoma cell lines resulted
from the induction of cell death, we manually scored the
numbers of viable cells after Trypan blue staining. In

Combined treatment induced caspase-dependent
apoptosis
To characterize the mechanism of cell death
induced by ART and BRC combination treatment, nuclear
morphology and apoptosis markers were studied in GH3 and
MMQ cells treated with these agents for 24 h (Figure 3).
The combination of ART and BRC increased the number
of cells displaying the nuclear morphology characteristic of
apoptotic cell death, which includes pyknotic nuclei, nuclear
chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation (Figure
3A and 3B). Furthermore, we performed annexin V and
propidium iodide (PI) apoptosis assays to observe apoptosis
by nuclear staining (Figure 3C and 3D) and FACS (Figure
4A and 4B). Co-treatment of GH3 and MMQ cells with
ART and BRC dramatically increased the population of cells
stained with annexin V and PI (p = 0.018 and p = 0.021);
about 40% of cells were found to have entered apoptosis
(Figure 4A and 4B). The apoptosis rates were higher for
combination treatment than for treatment with ART and
BRC alone. Combination treatment also increased caspase-3
in a synergistic manner compared with the single treatments
(Figure 4C; p = 0.007 and p = 0.004). Furthermore, the pancaspase inhibitor Z-Vad-FMK significantly inhibited the
reduction in cell viability caused by the combined treatment
(p = 0.008 and p = 0.013), confirming the classic caspase
pathway as the predominant mechanism for GH3 and MMQ
cell apoptosis (Figure 4D). These results indicated that the
inhibitory effects on cell proliferation and viability induced
by combination treatment might be attributable to apoptosis.

combination treatment effectively reduced cell motility,
indicating that co-treatment might inhibit the migration
and invasion of pituitary adenoma cells. An ELISA
assay also revealed a superior inhibitory effect of the
combination treatment on the production and release of
PRL in MMQ and GH3 cells (Figure 5G).

To investigate whether combination treatment with
ART and BRC inhibited cell migration and invasion, we
performed wound-healing scratch assays (Figure 5A, 5B,

Combination treatment induced cell apoptosis by
downregulating miR-200c expression

to detect apoptosis in transfected cells after combination
treatment, overexpression of miR-200c was shown to
reduce apoptosis (p = 0.028, p = 0.035) (Figure 6E),
while antagonization of miR-200c increased apoptosis
after combination treatment (p = 0.014, p = 0.02). These
analog and antagonist transfection experiments indicated
that the combination treatment might induce apoptosis by
downregulating miR-200c expression.

In previous studies, we found that miR-200c was
markedly higher in the MMQ [17] and GH3 cell lines than
in RPC cells (Figure 6A). We therefore investigated whether
the combination treatment would up- or downregulate miR200c expression in these cells. Real-time PCR analysis
demonstrated that only combination treatment significant
downregulated miR-200c expression in MMQ and GH3
cells (p = 0.003) (Figure 6B), and that combination treatment
reduced the level of miR-200c in a synergistic manner.
To understand the effect of the combination
treatment on the biological function of miR-200c, we
transduced the GH3 and MMQ cell lines with a miR-200c
analog or inhibitor. The transfection rates are shown in
Figure 6C. In cells transfected with the analog, the levels
of miR-200c were dramatically greater than the levels
in vector control cells. Caspase-3 activity was assessed
after combination treatment of transfected cells (Figure
6D), and the results indicated that overexpression of miR200c reduced caspase-3 activity (p = 0.036, p = 0.021)
while downregulation of miR-200c increased caspase-3
activity (p = 0.019, p = 0.011). When FACS was used

Downregulation of miR-200c during
combination treatment-induced apoptosis is
accompanied by increased expression of Pten
As in our previous study, we evaluated Pten
expression by immunocytochemistry, Western blotting,
and qRT-PCR (Figure 7). Immunocytochemistry revealed
that PTEN was present in the cytoplasm (plurality) and
nucleus (Figure 7A and 7B). Western blotting indicated
that PTEN protein expression increased after combination
treatment (Figure 7C and 7D), and qRT-PCR also
demonstrated that the combination treatment stimulated
Pten mRNA expression in GH3 (p = 0.012) and MMQ (p
= 0.023) cells (Figure 7E and 7F).

To explore the regulatory relationship between
miR-200c and Pten, we examined Pten expression after
transfecting GH3 and MMQ cells with a miR-200c analog
or inhibitor. As shown in Figure 7G, overexpression
of miR-200c markedly reduced Pten mRNA levels (p
= 0.014, p = 0.021), while miR-200c antagonization
distinctly increased the expression of Pten mRNA (p =
0.022, p = 0.034). These results indicated that miR-200c
negatively regulates Pten mRNA expression.
To investigate the regulation of Pten by miR200c following combination treatment, we performed
the co-treatment in GH3 and MMQ cells transfected
with the miR-200c analog or inhibitor, and evaluated
Pten expression relative to that in vector control cells.
Following combination treatment, Pten expression

decreased in analog-transfected cells (p = 0.027, p =
0.039) and increased in inhibitor-transfected cells (p
= 0.030, p = 0.018) (Figure 7G). These observations
suggested that the downregulation of miR-200c may be
functionally important for the upregulation of Pten in
combination-treatment induced apoptosis.

Pten overexpression reduced miR-200c
expression
The expression of Pten following transfection of
cells with pcDNA3.1/Pten and pcDNA3.1/Egfp was
determined by qRT-PCR, and was found to be greater
following the former treatment (p < 0.01) (Figure 8B). The
transfection efficiency of the Pten plasmid was shown to

after a median follow-up period of 12-18 months was 30%
for microprolactinomas and 36% for macroprolactinomas
[20]. Similarly, Kharlip et al. reported a recurrence of
over 60% for hyperprolactinemia at 18 months [21]. A
meta-analysis of 19 studies and a total of 743 patients
indicated that only 21% of patients had persistent
normoprolactinemia after DA withdrawal [22].
Besides recurrence, there are other challenges in the
treatment of pituitary adenoma, including DA resistance and
safety. The prevalence of DA resistance in prolactinomas,
including macro- and microprolactinomas, was 25-50%
for BRC and 5-15% for cabergoline [23]. Our previous

DISCUSSION
DAs have been used to treat prolactinomas for 35
years, and increasing recurrence rates have been reported
in the past 10 to 15 years after withdrawal of treatment.

report indicated that ART induced apoptosis and inhibited
proliferation in GH3 and MMQ cells [15, 16]. In an effort
to potentiate the inhibition of pituitary adenoma cell growth
against a background of altered DA resistance and side effects,
we evaluated ART in combination with low-dose BRC, and
demonstrated that this combination treatment inhibited
pituitary adenoma GH3 and MMQ cell growth. Furthermore,
at the concentrations used in this work (2 μM ART with 15
μM BRC), the drugs had less influence on RPC cells.
BRC causes a time- and dose-dependent delay in the
cell cycle, as shown by Johansen et al., who found that GH3
cells in S phase are most sensitive to BRC [24]. We found
that combination treatment with ART and BRC arrested
GH3 and MMQ cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle,
indicating that the antiproliferative effect of combination
treatment may result from a cell cycle blockade.
Pituitary adenomas are distinguished by a series
of phenotypic abnormalities, and although these

fundamental defects manifest themselves as intractable
disease, oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes typically
involved in the pathogenesis of other tumors do not [25,
26]. PTEN is frequently mutated or deleted in numerous
tumors, especially in endometrial carcinoma [27]. Whether
its activity is lost by mutation, deletion, or promoter
methylation silencing at high frequency, as is the case
in many primary and metastatic human cancers, PTEN
downregulation usually has the same result: persistent AKT
signaling that contributes to tumor formation [28, 29].
The majority of studies have demonstrated that PTEN is
downregulated in pituitary adenomas rather than mutated.
Qi et al. [30] found that Pten expression in the pituitary
glands of rats decreased after the rats were exposed to
electromagnetic pulses. Tena-Suck et al. [31] analyzed
the immunoexpression of PTEN in 45 cases of pituitary
adenoma, and noted that PTEN expression was higher in
nonfunctional hypophysis adenomas than in functional

adenomas. Chen et al. [32] demonstrated that autocrine PRL
production is induced by the PTEN–PI3K–AKT pathway,
while Musat et al. [33] reported that PTEN expression
was reduced and the AKT pathway was activated with cell
cycle changes in pituitary tumors. Our results demonstrated
that the protein and mRNA levels of Pten increased after
combination treatment of MMQ and GH3 cells.
MiR-200c is involved in the tumorigenesis and
progression of many cancers [34, 35]. In our previous
study, we found that the expression of miR-200c was

higher in human pituitary adenoma samples than in normal
pituitary samples. To investigate whether miR-200c was
involved in combination treatment-induced apoptosis,
we evaluated the expression of miR-200c in GH3 and
MMQ cells. MiR-200c was reduced in a synergistic
manner after combination treatment, and overexpression
of miR-200c suppressed combination treatment-induced
apoptosis, while antagonization of miR-200c increased
the rate of apoptosis after combination treatment. These
results implied that miR-200c is involved in the resistance

to apoptosis induced by combination treatment. In a
further exploration of this mechanism, we determined
that miR-200c expression was inversely associated with
Pten expression in GH3 and MMQ cells after combination
treatment. This outcome indicated that ART and BRC
function synergistically in pituitary adenoma cells through
enhanced inhibition of miR-200c by binding Pten.
In summary, our study demonstrated that the
synergistic inhibitory effects of ART and BRC on GH3
and MMQ cells resulted from the induction of apoptosis.
Combination treatment also attenuated migration and
invasion, and reduced hormone secretion in these cells.
The reduction in miR-200c expression is attributed to
apoptosis induced by combination treatment, which also
increased the expression of Pten (which was negatively
associated with miR-200c levels and positively associated
with combination treatment-induced apoptosis).
The combination of ART with BRC has important
future clinical potential, which may be applied as an
adjuvant therapy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of
prolactinoma treatment.

Austria). The formazan crystals from RPC cells were
dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO, and the optical density was
determined at 490 nm. Cell viability was assessed by Trypan
blue exclusion; viable and nonviable cells were manually
counted. The results are reported as the mean ± standard
deviation (SD) of at least three independent experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density
of 1 × 106 cells/well, harvested after 48 h of treatment,
and fixed with 500 μL of 70% ethanol overnight at 4°C.
Prior to cell cycle analysis, cells were washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), resuspended in 100 μL
of DNase-free RNase A, and incubated for 30 min at 37°C.
Next, 100 μL of PI solution was added and cells were
incubated for 30 min at 4°C in the dark. The distribution
of the cellular DNA content was analyzed by FACS
(EPICS XL-MCL, Beckman Coulter, Roissy, France). All
experiments were performed in triplicate.

Caspase activity assay
About 20,000 cells were treated for 48 h with the
indicated concentration of ART or BRC, or a combination
of both. Caspase-3 activity was assessed in 10 μL of total
cell lysate with a Caspase-3 Activity Assay kit (BestBio,
China), with spectrophotometric measurement at 405 nm.
Per the manufacturer’s recommendations, the total protein
concentration was measured with Coomassie blue G250
staining (BCA; BestBio, China). Cells treated with culture
medium were used as a positive control. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.

Cell cycle analysis

Chemicals and reagents
BRC (as 2-bromo-α-ergocryptine methanesulfonate
salt) was purchased from Novartis. ART for injection was
obtained from Guilin Pharma (China). Rat PRL (rPRL),
anti-rPRL antibody, and anti-rat GH antibodies were
purchased from CST (MA, USA).

Cell culture

Apoptosis analysis

The rat pituitary adenoma cell lines GH3 and
MMQ were purchased from the Xie-he Cell Bank, China.
Cells were cultured in complete F12 medium (Sigma,
US) supplemented with 15% horse serum, 2.5% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 5 U/mL penicillin, and 5 μg/mL
streptomycin (Invitrogen, CA, USA).
Rat pituitary cells (RPC) were purchased from
Ya ji Company, China, and were cultured in RPMI1640
medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS. All
cultured cells were maintained at 37°C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2.

Cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of
1 × 106 cells/well and incubated for 24 h before treatment.
Hoechst 33342 and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining were
used to detect apoptosis. All experiments were performed
in triplicate.

Scratch assay
Cells were seeded in 24-well poly-D-lysine-treated
plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well until confluence
of 80–90% in a monolayer was reached. The monolayer
was carefully scratched with a sterile 10-μL pipette tip
across the center of the bottom of the well, and a second
straight line was scratched perpendicular to the first to
create a cross in each well. After the scratching, the cells
were gently washed twice with PBS so that detached cells
could be removed, and the remaining cells were cultivated
for 48 h in culture medium with treatments. The scratched
area was observed again, and stained monolayers
were photographed in triplicate under microscopy. All
experiments were also performed in triplicate.

Cell growth and viability
Cells in log phase were washed three times with
serum-free culture medium and seeded (GH3 cells, 20,000–
30,000 cells/well; MMQ cells, 30,000–40,000 cells/well;
and RPC cells, 30,000–40,000 cells/well) into 96-well plates.
The next day, cells were treated with different agonists.
Cells were incubated in MTT solution for approximately 4
hours. For GH3 and MMQ cells, 100 μl acidified isopropyl
alcohol was added to each well, and the optical density was
determined at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer (Tecan,

Vector construction

Immunocytochemistry

The 3’-UTR of the Pten mRNA (containing the
miR-200c binding site) was amplified by PCR and cloned
into the BamHI/EcoRI site of a pcDNA3.1(+) vector
(Zoonbio) to construct the luc-Pten plasmid.

Cells were seeded into six-well poly-D-lysinetreated plates at 5 × 104 cells/well and allowed to adhere
before being fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15
minutes, washed twice with ice-cold PBS, blocked with
10% goat serum for 30 min, and incubated overnight
with a diluted PTEN antibody (1:100, Bioss, China)
in PBST at 4°C. Next, cells were washed three times
in PBS for 5 min per wash and incubated with the
secondary antibody in PBST for 1 h at room temperature
in the dark. After the plates were rinsed with PBS, PIconjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, Bioss, China)
was added and the cells were incubated with 0.1–1 μg/
mL Hoechst 33342 for 1 min. The Streptavidin-Biotin
Complex method was performed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Fixed cells were visualized
and images were captured with an Axio Observer Z1
(Carl Zeiss, Inc).

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
Cell culture supernatants were centrifuged for 20
minutes at 1000 g, and samples were stored at −80°C.
PRL levels in the supernatants were determined with a ratspecific ELISA kit (USCNK) for PRL, according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The concentrations of PRL in
the samples were determined through comparison of the
optical densities of the samples with the standard curve,
and were expressed as ng/mL and percent of control.

Invasion assays
Cell migration assays were performed in 24-well
Transwell plates with 8-μm pores (Corning, Santa Clara,
CA, USA). Stable GH3 and MMQ cells (5 × 105 cells
per well) were seeded in the upper culture chambers
with serum-free F12 medium, while growth medium
with 10% FBS was added to the lower chambers. After
48 h of incubation, both cells that invaded through the
Matrigel and non-migrant cells on the upper side of the
filter were counted and assessed. Filters were fixed with
4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes, then stained with 0.1%
crystal violet for 15 min. Three random fields were counted,
and the quantified results are presented as the mean ± SD.

qRT-PCR

Western blotting

Cells were collected by centrifugation at 500 g
for 5 min at 4°C and resuspended in the electroporation
medium at a concentration of 5 × 106 cells/mL. Next,
25μg of pcDNA3.1/Pten and pcDNA3.1/Egfp plasmid
DNA were added separately in a volume of up to 80 μL
per cuvette (Sigma) of cells [36]. Cells were incubated
on ice for 10 min before electroporation, and cell-linespecific parameters were set on the electroporation device
(280 V, and a single electric pulse of 10 ms). Cuvettes
were removed and placed immediately on ice for 5 min.
Electroporated cells were transferred to a 100-mm culture
dish. The cuvettes were washed three times with fresh
growth medium, and the washing solution was also added
to the culture dish.

Primers for the analysis of RNA expression were
designed by Primer-BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
Mixtures of 1 μg total RNA, 50 nM reverse primer, 2 units
of RNase inhibitor (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan), 5 units of
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Toyobo) and 0.5 μM dNTP
were used for each RT reaction. qRT-PCR was performed
in 20-μL reactions with the Bio-Rad S1000 detection
system (Toyobo).

Transfection of cells by electroporation

Cold PBS was used to rinse cells twice after
treatment. Cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer, and the
protein content in the supernatant was determined with
a BCA protein assay. For Western blot analysis, equal
amounts of total protein were mixed with 6× SDS sample
buffer and incubated at 100°C for 10 min, and aliquots of
30 μg protein in total were subjected to electrophoresis
on 8–12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were transferred
to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Co.,
MA, USA), which were rinsed twice with Tris-Buffered
Saline and Tween 20 (TBST), and incubated with 5%
non-fat milk (in TBST) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Following overnight incubation of the membranes with
the primary antibodies (anti-GAPDH, 1:1000; anti-PTEN
1:1000) at 4°C, three washes with TBST were performed
and the membranes were incubated with an HRPconjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 2
h. Following three washes with TBST, the antibody-bound
proteins were detected with a Super ECL Plus Detection
Reagent (Applygen Technologies Inc., China). The protein
band density was determined with ImageJ 1.38X software.

Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean ± SD from at least
three independent experiments. In all experiments, the
significance of the difference between two groups was
calculated with Tukey’s test after one-way analysis of
variance in SPSS 13.0 software. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
