ABSTRACT
Overexpression of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is associated with
increased tumor cell survival and radioresistance. In this study we explored the
efficacy of the novel HSP90 inhibitor AT13387 and examined its radiosensitizing
effects in combination with gamma-radiation in 2D and 3D structures as well as
mice-xenografts. AT13387 induced effective cytotoxic activity and radiosensitized
cancer cells in monolayer and tumor spheroid models, where low drug doses triggered
significant synergistic effects on cell survival together with radiation. Furthermore,
AT13387 treatment resulted in G2/M-phase arrest and significantly reduced the
migration capacity. The expression of selected client proteins involved in DNA repair,
cell-signaling and cell growth was downregulated in vitro, though the expression
of most investigated proteins recurred after 8–24 h. These results were confirmed
in vivo where AT13387 treated tumors displayed effective downregulation of HSP90
and its oncogenic client proteins.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that AT13387 is a potent new cancer
drug and effective radiosensitizer in vitro with an excellent in vivo efficacy. AT13387
treatment has the potential to improve external beam therapy and radionuclide
therapy outcomes and restore treatment efficacy in cancers that are resistant to
initial therapeutic regimes.

Heat shock proteins play, as the name implies,
a crucial role in the heat shock response. However, they
are not only induced in response to cellular stress; they
are equally as important under non-stress conditions where
they establish protein-protein interactions, restore threedimensional protein structures and help newly synthesized
proteins to fold into their correct confirmation. Heat shock
protein 90 (HSP90) is an evolutionarily conserved and
highly abundant protein, making up about 1%–2% of
the whole proteome in cells [4, 5]. So far, more than 200
HSP90 client proteins have been found, involved in all
kinds of cellular responses (e.g. cell cycle progression
and growth, cell signaling, migration, transcription
factors), many of which are activated in malignancy
[5–8]. Accordingly, an increased expression level of
HSP90 has been found in several hematologic and solid
tumors, including squamous cell carcinomas of the head

INTRODUCTION
Cancer treatments have undergone dramatic
improvement during the last century, much due to our
increasing molecular understanding of this elusive
disease category. This improvement has translated to
increased post-treatment life expectancy and quality of
life. Radiotherapy is today highly developed and one of
the most successful principles of cancer treatment, but
there still remains great potential to improve efficacy and
selectivity [1]. One potential avenue to increased effect
is novel co-treatments with radiosensitizing compounds,
preferably selectively targeting the tumor location
or cancer cell phenotype [2, 3]. Generally, pathways
involved in DNA repair and cell stress response are
suitable candidate targets for such co-therapy, given their
important role in cell survival upon radiation exposure.

and neck region (HNSCC) [9] and adenocarcinomas
[10–13]. This overexpression is associated with increased
tumor cell survival, an effect that is probably due to
stabilization of oncogenic cell signaling proteins, which
ultimately prohibits apoptosis. However, HSP90 activation
status does not always correlate with its expression and
HSP90 may form complexes, that along with a number
of cochaperones, can affect its function [14, 15]. HSP90
client proteins include mutated P53, MEK, FAK, CDK4,
PDGFR, VEGFR2, CDK-4, -6, Kit, ERK and AKT. In
addition, HSP90 stabilizes proteins that are known to
be associated with protection against radiation-induced
cell death, like HER2, EGFR, RAF-1 and AKT [16–19].
Stabilization of constitutively activated signaling proteins,
like AKT and ERK, promotes uncontrollable growth.
Targeting HSP90 with its broad repertoire
of interaction partners could possibly overcome
mutations in downstream signaling proteins and shut
down several pathways simultaneously; compounds
with this characteristic are therefore highly promising
enhancers of radiotherapy efficacy, including external
beam radiotherapy and radionuclide therapy using
immunotargeting
of
overexpressed
cell-surface
proteins [20]. The HSP90 targeting drug 17-N-Allylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) is a less toxic and
more stable derivative of the benzoquinone ansamycin
antibiotic geldanamycin [21, 22]. 17-AAG has been
well characterized for cancer treatment in numerous
preclinical and clinical studies. Unfortunately, the usage
of 17-AAG alone and/or in combination with other drugs
is limited due to bad solubility, high hepatotoxicity and
the potential to form toxic metabolites [21]. The novel
high-affinity HSP90 inhibitor, AT13387 (2,4-dihydroxy5-isopropyl-phenyl)-[5-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)1,3-dihydro-isoindol-2-yl] thanone, l-lactic acid salt)
is a non-geldanamycin inhibitor, which is easier to
administer and may have less toxicity than 17-AAG [23].
AT13387 is now undergoing clinical trials in phase I and
II including patients with prostate carcinomas, refractory
gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) and ALK positive
lung cancer [24, 25].
Today, the standard treatment of HNSCC
patients with advanced-stage locoregional disease is
a multidisciplinary approach involving surgery, chemoand radiation therapy. But the therapy options are often
limited due to high toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drugs
and adverse effects of the radiotherapy. With exception
of HPV positive tumors, the overall 5-year survival rate
of HNSCC is less than 50% and has remained relatively
unchanged for the past decades [26, 27]. Chemotherapeutic
radiosensitizing agents such as 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU),
cisplatin and oxaliplatin are standard therapy for metastatic
colorectal cancer in combination with radiotherapy, but
the development of chemoresistance is often inevitable.
Increasing chemoresistance indicates the demand for new

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

treatment options that target squamous cell carcinoma
and adenocarcinoma more effectively and with reduced
toxicity.
In this study the efficacy of the novel drug AT13387
was assessed in vitro and in vivo. We chose to examine
the squamous cell carcinoma cell lines H314 and A431
as well as the adenocarcinoma cell lines LS174T and
HCT116, as models for high incidence cancer types
with overexpression of HSP90, like head and neck
cancer and colon cancer. Furthermore, this study
investigates migration capacity, cell cycle progression
and downregulation of important HSP90 client proteins
as well as DNA repair efficiency after exposure to gamma
radiation. Possible radiosensitizing effects by AT13387
treatment were evaluated through synergy analysis
in monolayer and spheroid culture models. Ex vivo
immunohistochemistry of mice xenograft tumors was
performed after AT13387 treatment to study the effect on
target antigen expression in an in vivo setting.

RESULTS
AT13387 inhibits proliferation and reduces the
survival rate
In order to determine inhibitor potency and the
effect on cell proliferation and cell survival, clonogenic
assays were performed. AT13387 markedly decreased cell
viability and cell proliferation in SCC and colon cancer
cell lines. The IC50 values for A431, HCT116, LS174T and
H314 cells were in the low nanomolar range: 17.9, 8.7,
12.3 and 3 nM, respectively (Figure 1A). In comparison,
the IC50 values for LS174T and H314 treated with 17-AAG
were 6 and 30 times higher with 87 and 72 nM, respectively
(Figure 1B–1C).

Low doses of AT13387 radiosensitize cancer cells
in monolayer culture
We determined the effect of AT13387 on radiationinduced loss of cell survival with clonogenic assays.
Figure 2A shows that AT13387 affects the clonogenic
survival after radiation treatment in a concentration
dependent manner. The effect of the single treatments
on the cell growth are summarized in Figure 2B.
At a radiation dose of 4 Gy, 22% of H314 were able
to grow into a colony, while combination treatment
with 0.5 nM AT13387 reduced the survival by a factor
of 2, to 11%. At the same radiation dose 14% of H314
cells treated 50 nM 17-AAG survived the treatment
(Supplementary Figure 1A). 40% of A431 cells survived
a radiation dose of 4 Gy while only 33% survived 4 Gy
and 0.5 nM AT13387. At a radiation dose of 6 Gy,
0.5 nM AT13387 reduced the survival by more than a
factor of two, from 25% to 12%. AT13387 treatment

sensitized cells at lower concentrations than treatment
with 17-AAG (Supplementary Figure 1B). Here drug
doses above 50 nM were needed to radiosensitize the
investigated cell lines. Analysis of the clonogenic
survival data using the synergy model described by
Valeriote et al. [28] displayed significantly reduced
survival after irradiation and various concentrations
of AT13387. When comparing survival fractions from
combination treatment with calculated expected survival
fractions Sexp from single treatments, statistically
significant radiosensitizing and synergistic effects could
be seen on all cell lines for 50 nM AT13387 and radiation
doses of 2, 4 and 6 Gy (p < 0.05). Very low concentrations
of AT13387 (0.5–5 nM) did not radiosensitize LS174T
cells (see statistical summary in supplementary Table 1).
Furthermore, Chou-Talalays combination index (CI) [29]
was investigated and indicated synergistic effects for
5 out of 9 drug-radiation combinations for A431 cells and
8 out of 9 drug-radiation combinations for H314 cells
(CI ≤ 0.9). CI values for the treatment combinations for
the colorectal cell lines LS174T and HCT116 displayed
synergistic effects or strong synergistic effects for all
investigated drug and radiation doses (for CI values see
supplementary Table 2). The CI value was lowered to
a greater extent by increasing drug dosages as compared
to radiation dosages, indicating that AT13387 potentiates
the effects of radiation.

effects were studied in a tumor cell spheroid assay
(Figure 3). Spheroid size was compared by measuring
cross sectional area of a fitted ellipse at consecutive
timepoints after treatment. A431 and LS174T cells were
not able to form individual tumor spheroids and were
excluded from analysis. After 22 days, tumor spheroids
treated with a fractionated radiation dose (2 Gy/day
during 5 consecutive days) grew significantly slower
than controls, to about 56% of the control spheroid size
(p < 0.05) for H314 and 57% for HCT116. H314 spheroids
incubated with 5 nM AT13387 reached approximately
35% of the control size and spheroids treated with 5 nM
AT13387 and fractionated radiation reached about 17%.
HCT116 spheroids incubated with 5 nM AT13387 reached
approximately 45% of the control size and spheroids
treated with 5 nM AT13387 and fractionated radiation
reached about 18%. 50 and 100 nM doses of AT13387
inhibited the growth of H314 and HCT116 spheroids and
led to shrinkage and total degradation of the 3 dimensional
structures. To obtain similar shrinkage and degradation
with 17-AAG on H314 spheroids it was necessary to use
much higher drug doses (3 × 500 nM, Supplementary
Figure 2 and Figure 2A).
After 22 days a significant ( p < 0.0001) synergistic
effect for combination treatment of 5 nM AT13387 and
a fractionated radiation dose could be observed for both
H314 and HCT116 spheroids.

AT13387 treatment results in G2/M phase arrest
and S phase reduction

after expose of the drug was studied using pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis on all four cell lines. AT13387 combined
with radiation treatment induced higher amounts of
DSBs than cells that were only irradiated. Contrary to
expectations, AT13387 had no significant effect on the
DNA repair capacity after irradiation in all four tested
cell lines. Apart from a minor initial delay, treated and
untreated cells showed similar repair rates after 4 h of
repair time (Figure 4A). Treatment with 17-AAG reduced
the repair capacity by a factor of two after 4 h of repair
time (Supplementary Figure 3). Furthermore, after 24 h of
repair time under normal growth conditions the difference
in the DSBs repair between 17-AAG and control was still
present (data not shown).

The effects of AT13387 on cell cycle progression
were studied by flow cytometry. The relatively large
fraction of S and G2/M phases in untreated cells indicated
that all cell cultures were in exponential growth phase.
A dose-dependent accumulation of cells in the G2/M
phase was seen, most pronounced at the highest drug
concentration in all cell lines (Figure 4C). A statistically
significant increase of cells in G2/M was seen in H314,
A431 and HCT116 cells. The effect was largest in H314
cells, where twice as many cells were arrested in G2 after
24 h treatment with 500 nM AT13387 compared with
untreated cells. Further, AT13887 caused a reduction of
cells in G1 and a reduction/depletion of S phase fraction.

AT13387 reduces cell migration and motility
Scratch wound healing assays were performed
to assess the effects of AT13387 on cell migration and
motility. The migration distance significantly decreased
in concentration-depended manner after 24 h exposure to
both 5 nM and 50 nM AT13387 (Figure 4B). Untreated
HCT116 cells migrated 0.12 mm on average while cells
treated with 50 nM moved 0.07 mm. Similarly, A431 cells
treated with 50 nM AT13387 migrated only half the
distance (0.07 mm) as untreated control cells (0.14 mm).

AT13387. Treatment with 5 nM AT13387 reduced the
protein level of the target HSP90, ATM, DNA-PKcs (also
known as PRKDC), EGFR and AKT, an effect that was
more distinct with increasing concentration (Figure 5A).
After 500 nM treatment only 34% of the initial HSP90,
51% of the initial ATM, 22% of the initial DNA-PKcs level,
33% of the initial EGFR and 19% of the initial AKT level
remained in H314 cells, as evaluated by ratios of signal
intensity. In LS174T cells, treatment of 500 nM AT13387
reduced HSP90 expression to 58%, the client protein level
to 49% for ATM, 59% for DNA-PKcs, 48% for EGFR and
44% for AKT. CD44 and CD44v6 expression did not change
considerably with increasing drug concentration.
Further, to evaluate how the HSP90 inhibitor affects
protein expression after removal of the drug, the recurrence
of HSP90, cell surface receptors and DNA repair proteins
was studied. HSP90 and ATM levels remained relatively
unchanged after 4 h to 24 h of drug removal, while depletion
of other HSP90 client proteins was transient. The majority of
protein levels returned to normal levels after drug removal
within 24 h. Figure 5B shows that detectable recovery of
the proteins occurred already after 4 h under normal growth
conditions. 8 h after withdrawal of the drug more than 50%
of the receptors and repair proteins had recurred and after
24 h the initial protein level was reached. After 24 h DNAPKcs protein levels were increased by 30% than before
the initial treatment in LS174T cells. This effect was even
greater in H314 cells.

Mice of the treatment group were given 5 doses of 50
mg/kg AT13387 on 5 consecutive days. Tumors were
removed 24 h after last injection. Animals displayed no
body weight changes or other adverse effects during the
treatment period. AT13387 treatment showed limited
effects on tumor volume in vivo. The changes in tumor
size were not statistically significant (data not shown),
probably due to the short treatment time of 5 days.
However, in the in vivo setting, AT13387 showed an
effective and prolonged efficacy on the molecular level.
As described earlier, AT13387 targets the molecular
chaperon HSP90 and leads to its degradation. Our results
distinctly visualize the depletion of HSP90 proteins after
AT13387 treatment in the xenograft tumors (Figure 6A).
The corresponding mean H-scores are depicted in Figure
6B. As evident from the figure, the expression levels of
the target HSP90, the growth receptors EGFR and MET
and the DNA repair proteins DNA-PKcs and ATM were
significantly lower after drug treatment compared with
control animals (Figure 6B). The expression of CD44 was
not reduced to the same extent as HSP90, EGFR and MET,
while the CD44v6 levels remained unchanged. Expression
histograms are displayed in Supplementary Figure 4.

DISCUSSION
The treatment options of advanced HNSCC and
colorectal cancer are limited due to treatment resistance
and severe adverse effects to healthy tissue. The
concept of combination treatments that could potentiate
the effects of single treatments is promising and has
great potential for future therapeutic improvements.
HSP90 client proteins are involved in all hallmarks
of cancer, making HSP90 inhibitors promising anticancer drugs alone and especially in combination

with other treatments. HSP90 inhibitors have been
shown to block DNA damage repair in combination
with radiation treatment [30, 31]. The HSP90 inhibitor
NVP-AUY922 for example has been described to
radiosensitize cells by depletion of proteins involved
in homologous recombination resulting in mitotic entry
with unresolved DNA damage [32]. A recent study
indicated that AT13387 treatment could overcome
resistance of melanoma cells to BRAF/MEK inhibitors.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Furthermore, combination treatment of these inhibitors
and AT13387 has the potential to reduce or even
prevent the emergence of resistance [20]. However,
clinical outcomes of first generation HSP90 inhibitors
alone or in combination with other treatments has been
modest due to poor solubility in water, difficulties in
formulation, inconsistent pharmacokinetics and high
hepatotoxicity [21]. The high-affinity HSP90 inhibitor
AT13387 may overcome these limitations since it is

easier to administer and may have less toxicity than the
previous described drugs [24].
In this study, we investigated the efficacy of AT13387
in both 2D and 3D structures as well as mice xenografts,
and tested whether treatment of AT13387 can radiosensitize
SCC and colon cancer cells. We demonstrate that AT13387
induces effective cytotoxic activity in all four cancer cell
lines with an IC50 < 20 nM, which was 6–30 times lower than
for 17-AAG. For the first time, we could also demonstrate
that treatment with AT13387 in vitro at clinically relevant
concentrations in combination with ionizing radiation result
in synergistic, radiosensitizing effects. Interestingly, the
CI values, calculated by the Chou-Talalay method were
lowered to a greater extent by increasing AT13387 dosages
as compared with radiation dosages, indicating that AT13387
treatment potentiates the effects of radiation. Several studies
have shown that drug incubation time prior irradiation is of
high importance for synergy with radiation [33]. We used
two different pre-incubation times, one hour and 24 hours, to
establish an optimal schedule for the combination. There was
no significant difference in the survival fraction of H314 cells
pre-incubated 1 h or 24 h before irradiation (data not shown),
both exposure times radiosensitized the cells equally. In 3D
cell cultures, treatment with AT13387 significantly reduced
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the growth of the tumor cell spheroids. After 22 days of
spheroid growth, a significant synergistic effect at 5 nM
AT13387 and radiation fractions of 5 times 2 Gy was seen,
and the combination effect was present at much lower
dosages than with 17-AAG. The combination effect is
probably higher with increasing dosages of AT13387, but at
these concentrations the combined treatment effect was too
great to measure since no cells survived.
We suspected that AT13387-mediated inhibition of
HSP90 interrupts central factors of DSB and SSB repair,
thus amplifying the radiation effect and leading to the
observed synergy. Similarly, inhibition of homologous
recombination in prostate and lung cancer has been
reported by 17-AAG treatment. Importantly, neither the
radiosensitization nor the deficient DSB repair was observed
in normal fibroblasts [34]. Moreover, new client proteins
of HSP90 which are essential in DSB repair pathways are
constantly reported, such as ataxia-telangiectasia mutated
(ATM), ataxia-telangiectasia and rad3-related (ATR), or the
MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN) complex [30, 35, 36], which
indicates a great potential of HSP90 inhibitors for clinical
benefit. Surprisingly, even if AT13387 treatment resulted
in a substantial downregulation of the essential DNA repair
proteins DNA-PKcs and ATM, we found no apparent

effect on the repair capacity after radiation exposure.
However, radiation sensitivity is determined by a number
of processes in the DNA damage response, including repair,
checkpoint activation and apoptosis. Also, low levels of
DNA repair proteins may be enough for a sufficient repair
response but could lead to failure in check-point regulation.
A recent study confirms that 80%–95% decrease of DNAPKcs levels induced by siRNA treatment lead to extreme
radiosensitivity, without affecting the DNA double strand
repair [37]. Earlier results suggest that reduced levels of
DNA-PKcs may lead to mitotic failure [38], an effect which
is uncoupled from its direct role in the DSB repair. Further,
many repair proteins have a long half-life in the cell (more
than 5 days), meaning that correctly folded repair proteins
available in spite of HSP90 inhibition and 24 h of drug
exposure may not be enough to completely downregulate
crucial proteins. These results contrast earlier studies and
data for 17-AAG (Figure 4B, Supplementary Figure 3)
and apparently the radiosensitization by AT13387 not only
include DNA repair mechanisms, but also several cell-linespecific pathways and the destabilization and degradation of
multiple HSP90 client proteins cause delays in proliferation
and cell cycle impairments.
Certainly, the most lethal characteristics of an
aggressive cancer phenotype are the ability to rapidly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

proliferate, move through tissue and form metastasis at
distant locations. We could show for the first time that
AT13387 treatment significantly decreases cancer cell
motility and migration ability in vitro. Further, AT13387
disrupts cell-cycle regulation and causes G2/M arrest and
simultaneous reduction of S-phase fraction. Our findings
are supported by similar effects seen after treatment with
other anti-HSP90 drugs, e.g. NVP-AUY922 or NVPBEP800 [31]. These effects may be explained by the fact
that cell-cycle regulators are part of the complex network
of tumorigenesis, and that important factors including P53,
CDK1, CDK2 and CDK4 are stabilized by HSP90 [31].
The question of oncoprotein downregulation after
drug treatment has also gained great clinical attention
and importance for patient response monitoring.
Immunohistochemistry on A431 tumors with high
expression levels of the growth factor receptor EGFR
and the hyaluronan binding molecule CD44 and its splice
variant CD44v6 indicated high efficacy of the drug. After
treating A431 tumor bearing mice for 5 days with 50 mg/kg
of AT13387 the expression of its target protein HSP90 was
almost completely reduced. The same was true for the
repair protein ATM and the oncogenic growth receptors
EGFR and MET. Numerous studies have shown the effects
of first generation HSP90 inhibitors on HER2 expression
35659

Oncotarget

(e.g. 17-AAG, 17-DMAG) in vitro and in vivo [22, 39, 40].
HER2 is a member of the EGFR family and commonly
expressed in breast, ovarian and prostate cancer. HER2
expression in HNSCC and colon cancer is insignificant
and cannot be used as a biomarker for treatment outcomes
using molecular imaging techniques. However, HNSCC and
adenocarcinomas of the colorectal region are EGFR positive
or highly positive. Our results indicate that HSP90 and
EGFR could be used as biomarkers for treatment response
monitoring during AT13387 therapy in HNSCC and colon
cancer. Importantly, the expression of CD44v6, which is
commonly overexpressed in HNSCC, was not altered as
determined by IHC analysis. This makes CD44v6 a potential
target for radionuclide-immunotherapy in combination with
AT13387. By targeting CD44v6, patients could benefit from
the radiosensitizing effects of AT13387. Another possibility
would be to reduce the radiation exposure to healthy organs
while maintaining therapeutic effect.
Addressing the problem of oncoprotein recurrence
after drug treatment is critical for finding the optimal time
window for drug and radiation treatment. Western blot
results confirmed the previously described findings from
ex vivo IHC. 24 h exposure to nanomolar concentrations
of AT13387 reduced the levels of key signaling and repair
proteins in a concentration dependent manner. Our results
confirm recent studies on melanoma and gastrointestinal
cancer cell lines, where AT13387 treatment downregulated
key signaling and DNA repair proteins [4, 20, 41, 42].
The expression of the cancer stem-like cell marker CD44
and the novel HNSCC stem-like cell marker CD44v6
[43, 44] did not change considerably with increasing drug
concentrations. Overexpression of CD44 is associated
with increased radioresistance [45]. Yet, concentrations of
5–500 nM AT13387 could not completely downregulate the
levels of the investigated proteins, suggesting that a longer
exposure or higher concentrations are necessary, as was
also indicated by the xenograft outcomes. Surprisingly, the
tested molecules were able to recur after relatively short
time intervals; 24 h after drug-removal, EGFR, AKT, CD44
and CD44v6 expression was at the same level as before
treatment. The DNA-PKcs levels were even higher than
before treatment, suggesting that radiation therapy would
have to be initiated relatively close in time with HSP90
inhibitor therapy. These results are contrary to results where
AT13387 has been described to downregulate proteins
for more than 72 h [41], possibly explained by the higher
concentrations used in that study. On the other hand, our
ex vivo immunohistochemistry stains confirm effective
downregulation of client proteins 24 h after the fifth daily
AT13387 injection, demonstrating a long and effective
biological half-life of the drug in in vivo environments.
Furthermore, animals in the in vivo study displayed no body
weight changes or other adverse effects during the treatment
period.
Currently, AT13387 is undergoing clinical trials in
phase I and II including patients with prostate carcinomas,
GIST and lung cancer, but these studies do not include
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

external beam radiation or radionuclide therapy. Our
results demonstrate that AT13387 has the potential to
improve radiotherapy including radio-immunotherapy
outcomes significantly in squamous cell carcinomas and
adenocarcinomas and restore treatment efficacy in cancers
that are resistant to initial treatments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and cell lines
The adenocarcinoma cell lines HCT116 and
LS147T, obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) were cultured in
McCoy’s 5A medium and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium (DMEM), respectively, supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
USA), L-glutamine and antibiotics (100 IU penicillin
and 100 μg/ml streptomycin) from Biochrom Kg,
(Berlin, Germany). The squamous cell carcinoma cell
lines A431, obtained from American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and H314 from
the European Collection of Cell Cultures (Salisbury,
UK), were cultured in Ham’s F10 and DMEM medium
in a 1:1 mixture of Ham’s F12, respectively, with
supplements as above. Medium with supplements is
referred to as “complete medium” in this article. Cells
were incubated at 37°C in an atmosphere containing
humidified air with 5% CO2. The cell lines were selected
for their different radiation sensitivity and because
they represent cancer types with known high HSP90
expression. The cell lines in this study were cultured for
fewer than six months after purchase from the supplier.

Tumor spheroid culture
Tumor spheroids were cultured as described earlier
[46]. In short, H314, HCT116, A431 and LS174T cells
were harvested by trypsinization. A defined amount
of cells was seeded in 96-well, 0.15% agarose-coated
culture-plate, with approximately 1000–3000 cells per
well. The cells were incubated for up to 3 weeks at 37°C
in an atmosphere containing humidified air with 5% CO2.
Half of the medium was renewed every fourth to fifth day.

Drug and radiation treatment
Drug preparation: AT13387 (Astex Pharmaceuticals,
Cambridge, UK) was kindly provided by the NIH,
USA. AT13387 was stored as a lyophilized powder and
dissolved in 17.5% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin
before use. 17-AAG (A.G. Scientific, San Diego, CA,
USA) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted in complete
medium to the desired concentrations.
For in vitro experiments: Cells seeded for cell
viability (IC50) and clonogenic assay were pre-plated
and incubated with AT13387 (0.5, 1, 5, 15, 20, 50, 100,
35660

Oncotarget

500 and 1000 nM) or 17-AAG (0.5, 1, 5, 50, 100, 500
and 1000 nM). Radiation treatment was given 1 h after
drug incubation using a 137Cs γ-ray irradiator at a doserate of 1 Gy/min (Best Theratronics Gammacell®
40  Exactor, Springfield, USA). Spheroid cultures were
grown for 1–2 days prior drug treatment. For AT13387
treatment spheroids were exposed to 5, 50 and 100 nM
concentrations once. Irradiation followed 1 h after drug
treatment. Half of the incubation medium was replaced
with fresh complete medium every 4–5 days. For 17-AAG
spheroids were either incubated with 3 × 500 nM 17-AAG
or corresponding DMSO concentrations every 48 h and
rinsed in complete medium 7 times before each new
treatment.
For in vivo experiments: Animals in the treatment
group (n = 6) were treated with AT13387 every 24 h for
five consecutive days. Each time 50 mg/kg AT13387
(dissolved in 17.5% (w/v) hydroxypropyl-b-cyclodextrin)
was given subcutaneously in the neck area.

Mannheim, Germany). Plugs were transferred to HSbuffer after > 20 hours and incubated overnight (HS: High
Salt; 1.85 M NaCl, 0.15 M KCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 2 mM
EDTA, 4 mM Tris, 0.5% Triton X-100, pH 7.5) at 4°C.
Before electrophoresis, plugs were washed 2 × in 0.1 M
EDTA and equilibrated in 0.5 × TBE and loaded into an
agarose gel (0.8% SeaKem Gold, Lonza, USA). PFGE was
performed with Gene Navigator unit (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) with 120° between the fields.
After electrophoresis, the gel was divided at the position
of the 5.7 Mbp chromosome from S. pombe (BMA),
and the DNA-incorporated 14C activity was measured by
liquid scintillation. Fraction Activity Released (FAR) was
calculated by dividing the fraction of radioactivity (14C)
corresponding to DNA strands less than 5.7 Mbp and the
total radioactivity in each lane.

Cell migration and motility
The cell migration ability of A431 and
HCT116 cells was studied using a scratch assay at
confluence, as previously reported [49]. In short,
cells were grown in 6 well plates and were washed
and incubated with normal cell medium, 5 or 50 nM
AT13387. Then, a narrow area on the confluent cell
monolayers was scratched off with a p100 pipette tip.
Images from the same scratch location were obtained
directly after scratching and after 24 h incubation.
Migration distance in mm was calculated as (width of
the scratch at time 0–width of the scratch at 24 h)/2.
Significance testing was made using two-tailed Student’s
t test and was considered significant if p < 0.05.
Experiments were repeated three times.

Clonogenic assay
Cell survival was performed using clonogenic
assay which measures the cell colony forming ability,
as described earlier [47]. In short, a defined amount of
cells was pre-plated into 25 cm2 culture flasks with 8
ml complete medium. Cells were allowed to attach for
about 24 h before incubation with complete medium
containing 17-AAG or AT13387. After 25 h cells
were exposed to external beam radiation. After colony
formation time (H314: 21 days, A431: 14 days, HCT116:
14 days, LS174t: 7 days), cells were fixated with 95%
ethanol and stained with crystal violet. Colonies of
greater than 50 cells per colony were counted. Plating
efficiency, PE, (number of colonies formed/number of
cells seeded in the control) and the survival fraction,
SF, (number of colonies formed after treatment/number
of cells seeded × PE) were calculated. The curves were
fitted to a linear quadratic model using Graphpad Prism
5d (Graphpad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).

Flow cytometry
H314, A431, LS174T and HCT116 cells were
incubated for 24 h with 5, 50 or 500 nM AT13387 prior
to cell cycle analysis. Cells were harvested by using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma Aldrich,
St. Louis, USA) and fixated with 70% ethanol and kept
in –20°C for at least 24 h. After 2 washes with PBS
cells  were  incubated with 10 μg/ml propidium iodide
(Sigma Aldrich)/0.1% NP-40 (Sigma Aldrich) or 1 μg/ml
DAPI (Sigma Aldrich) together with 5 μg/ml RNase (Sigma
Aldrich) for 30 min. Cells were analyzed on a SORP BD
LSRII (Becton Dickinson Biosciences, San Jose, USA) and
on a Partec CyFlow Cube Sorter (Partec GmbH, Germany)
with integrated FSC express version 4.0 (De Novo Software,
CA, USA) software. FCS files were analyzed with Flowing
Software 2.5.1 (Turku Centre for Biotechnology, Finland)
and ModFit LT program (Verity Software House, Topsham,
ME, USA). For the evaluation of intracellular DNA content,
at least 10,000 events for each point were analyzed in at least
three different experiments. Statistical analysis of the cell
cycle phases was performed using a one-way ANOVA with
Tukey posttest.

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
PFGE was performed as described previously [48].
H314 and LS174T cells were grown for two doubling
times in culture medium containing 2 kBq/ml [methyl14
C] thymidine (Perkin Elmer), followed by irradiation
with a radiation dose of 40 Gy on ice. After irradiation,
cells were allowed to repair for 0, 15, 60 min and 24 h
at 37°C, before trypsinization and plug formation. For
the plug formation, cells were mixed with 0.6% low
gelling-point agarose (InCert, BMA, Rockland, USA) at
a concentration of 1.5–2.5 × 106 cells/ml and transferred
into plug-molds. After gelling, plugs were transferred into
ESP lysis buffer at 4°C, containing 0.5 M EDTA at pH
8.0, 2% sarkosyl (N-lauroylsarcosine) (Sigma Aldrich, St.
Louis, USA) and 1 mg/ml proteinase K (Roche Diagnostics,

sectioned, and deparaffinised. Antigen retrieval was
achieved by microwaving (10 + 15 min) in citrate buffer
(DAKO,S2369) or Tris-EDTA buffer (DAKO, S2367).
Immunostaining with anti-HSP90 (Abcam, UK), antiDNA-PKcs (Abcam, UK), anti-CD44 (Abcam, UK),
anti-CD44v6 (AbD serotec), anti-EGFR, anti-MET
and anti-ATM (Abcam, UK) performed according to
manufactures instructions. The secondary step has been
Dako EnVision+ System- HRP labeled polymer anti-rabbit
or EnVision FLEX/HRP (K8000, Dako). The sections
were counterstained with Mayer’s hematoxylin (DAKO).

For western blot analysis, whole-cell lysates were
prepared according to standard protocols. The protein
concentration was determined by BCA protein assay
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, USA). Samples were
separated on a SDS PAGE and afterwards transferred
to a nitrocellulose membrane by wet blotting. The
nitrocellulose membrane was blocked for 1 hour in
PBS with 5% BSA and then incubated with the primary
antibodies over night at 4°C. Primary antibodies used
were anti-DNA-PKcs (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), antiEGFR (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), anti-CD44 (Biolegend,
San Diego, CA, USA), CD44v6 (AbD serotec, Biorad, UK), anti-AKT (Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA) and anti-beta-actin (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, USA). After washing in PBS with 1% Tween-20,
membrane was incubated with respective and speciesspecific Horse Radish Peroxidase-labeled secondary
antibody (Invitrogen). Immunoreactive bands were
visualized with a CCD camera (SuperCCD HR, Fujifilm,
Japan) after treatment with electrochemiluminescent
solution (Immobilon, Millipore, Bedford, USA)
according to instructions from the manufacturer.
Quantitative densitometric analysis of western blot
results was performed using ImageJ software version
1.48 (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). Relative levels of
protein expression were compared with the beta-actin
expression from the same cell lysate. One-way ANOVA
with Bonferroni post-test was used to evaluate significant
differences in signal intensity.

Image analysis
Images of cell spheroids (magnification × 4), migration
(magnification × 4) and IHC staining (magnification × 10)
were obtained using a Nikon D3000 digital camera mounted
on an inverted Nikon Diaphot-TMD microscope. Spheroids
were photographed every second to every fifth day for
about 3 weeks. The spheroid images were analyzed semiautomatically using the MTS Research Analysis Tool, RM
Medic-Tech (Uppsala, Sweden) and manually with the
ImageJ software version 1.48 (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA).
Outlines of the spheroid shape were drawn and the area
of the aggregates was measured. The migration pictures
were analyzed with ImageJ version 1.48 (NIH, Bethesda,
MD, USA).
Immunohistochemistry assays were semi-quantified
according to the H-score method as presented earlier
[50,  51]. Briefly, the H-score is acquired by manual
scoring of each cell in 5 intensity groups, 0 = no staining,
1 = weak staining, 2 = moderate staining, 3 = dark staining,
4 = maximum staining. The H-score is then the sum of
(0*p0)+(1*p1)+(2*p2)+(3*p3)+(4*p 4), where p0, 1, 2,
3, 4 is the percentage cells in the corresponding group,
yielding a H-score range of 0–400. H-scoring was done on
16 separate sections of each tumor tissue sample, counting
100 cells per section for a total of 1600 scored cells per
sample. The immunohistochemistry assays were scored
blinded with respect to target and treatment. One-way
ANOVA with Bonferroni post-test was used to evaluate
significant differences in H-score.

In vivo studies
All experiments complied with the current Swedish
law and were performed with permission granted by the
Uppsala Committee of Animal Research Ethics. The nu/nu
Balb/c mice (female; n = 12) were housed in a controlled
environment and fed ad libitum. Tumor xenografts were
formed by subcutaneous inoculation of approximately
9 × 106 A431 cells (high EGFR and CD44v6 expression)
suspended in 150 μl 1:1 cell medium : matrigel in the right
posterior leg.
After tumor growth of 2 weeks (animal age of
8 weeks), animals of the treatment group (n = 6) were
treated with AT13387 (see drug and radiation treatment).
All animals were euthanized 24 h after last injection dose
with a mixture of ketamine and zylazine followed by heart
puncture. The tumors were removed and directly fixated in
formalin. The average animal weight was 16.1 ± 1.5 g, and
average tumor weight was 0.41 ± 0.036 (SEM) g.

Statistical analysis and curve fitting
Microsoft Office Excel 2008 for Mac (Microsoft,
Redmond, WA, USA) and GraphPad Prism 5d for Mac
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA) were used for
data processing, graph plotting and statistical analysis.
For statistical analysis of cell survival after treatment with
drug, treatment outcome was compared between single
treatment and combination treatment using the additive
model of survival fractions described by Valeriote et al.
[28] and using the Chou-Talalay method [29]. Briefly, the
additive model assumes that a pure additive effect will lead
to an expected combination survival fraction Sexp = Sdrug *

Sradiation. If the observed combination survival fraction Sobs
is significantly lower than Sexp as determined by Student’s
t-test, the combination treatment is regarded as synergistic.
If Sobs was not significantly different from Sexp, but still
lower than Sradiation or Sdrug, the combination was regarded as
additive, whereas a significantly higher Sobs than Sexp, Sdrug
and Sradiation was regarded as antagonistic. We calculated
the combination index (CI) according to the Chou-Talalay
method (non-constant rate ratio) using the CompuSyn 3.0.1
software (CompuSyn, Inc., New York, USA). (CI > 1.1,
antagonism; 0.9 > CI  ≤  1.1, additive effect; 0.2 > CI ≤
0.9, synergism; CI < 0.2 strong synergism). In the case of
multicellular spheroids the synergy model described by
Valeriote et al. [28] was used (see analysis for clonogenic
survival data). In these experiments tumor volume changes
replaced the survival fraction.
For the IC50 analysis and curve fit, a normalized
log(response) inhibition model was used, with a fixed
Hill slope of -1: Y = 100/(1+10^((X-LogIC50))). Where
Y = survival (percentage), X = drug concentration,
IC50 = drug concentration at 50% survival. No
parameter constraints were used. Significance testing of
plating efficiencies was made using two-tailed Student’s
t test and was considered significant if p < 0.05.

CONCLUSION

GRANT SUPPORT

We could for the first time demonstrate potent antitumor effects of the novel HSP90 inhibitor AT13387
alone and in combination with radiation in SCC and
colon cancer cells in vitro as well as excellent efficacy
on HSP90 client protein expression in vivo. Especially
the synergistic combination effects even at low doses
AT13387 are promising for either radiation dose reduction
and minimization of side effects, or increased therapeutic
response. The mechanism behind this effect is likely to
relate to the observed downregulation of DNA repair, cell
signaling and cell growth oncoproteins after AT13387
treatment. These results strengthen the case for further
clinical studies of HSP90 inhibitors and radiation therapy
co-treatment.

This study was supported by grants from the
