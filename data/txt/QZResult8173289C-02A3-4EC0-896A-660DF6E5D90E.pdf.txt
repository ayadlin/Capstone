Abstract
Increasing knowledge about signal transduction pathways as drivers of cancer growth has elicited the
development of "targeted drugs," which inhibit aberrant signaling pathways. They require a companion diagnostic test that identiﬁes the tumor-driving pathway; however, currently available tests like estrogen receptor
(ER) protein expression for hormonal treatment of breast cancer do not reliably predict therapy response, at least
in part because they do not adequately assess functional pathway activity. We describe a novel approach to predict
signaling pathway activity based on knowledge-based Bayesian computational models, which interpret quantitative
transcriptome data as the functional output of an active signaling pathway, by using expression levels of
transcriptional target genes. Following calibration on only a small number of cell lines or cohorts of patient data,
they provide a reliable assessment of signaling pathway activity in tumors of different tissue origin. As proof of
principle, models for the canonical Wnt and ER pathways are presented, including initial clinical validation on
independent datasets from various cancer types. Cancer Res; 74(11); 2936–45. 2014 AACR.

Major Findings

Introduction

As expected, the Wnt pathway was predicted inactive in
normal colon samples and active in 97% of tested colon
adenomas and carcinomas (known to be Wnt driven) and in
all tested medulloblastomas containing an activating b-catenin mutation. Furthermore, in primary liver cancer, Wnt
activity was predicted in 56% of samples containing a
b-catenin mutation, against 18% without documented mutations. In breast cancer, Wnt activity was predicted in 30% of
basal-type breast cancers versus 7% of other subtypes, conﬁrming expectations based on clinical research.
The estrogen receptor (ER) pathway model predicted
inactivity in practically all tested samples, except for 39% of
ER-positive breast cancer samples. Furthermore, ER pathway activity was associated with increased disease-free
survival compared with patients in which the pathway was
predicted inactive, even though the model was not trained
for this purpose.
Clinical implementation of our models is expected to
enable a more informed choice of therapy and improved
prediction of targeted therapy response. Furthermore, it
may help to focus search for tumor-driving genomic defects
in whole-genome sequencing data to only those genes
involved in the aberrantly active pathway(s).

Knowledge on intracellular signal transduction pathways
governing cancer cell behavior and controling cell division is
rapidly increasing. This development has elicited a paradigm
shift toward development of a whole new category of "targeted drugs," aiming to target the aberrant signaling pathway, which drives tumor growth in the individual patient
with cancer (1). In contrast with conventional chemotherapy, targeted therapy requires a highly personalized
approach to treatment choice, in principle based on predicting treatment response before administering the drug or
drug combination of choice.
The anticipated increasing availability of targeted drugs
(2) stresses the need for reliable companion diagnostics to
predict therapy response, for which identiﬁcation of the
tumor-driving signaling pathway and the underlying defect
that causes its aberrant activation is of high importance
(3). Unfortunately, currently available tests often lack predictive value with respect to targeted therapy response. In
general, these tests demonstrate (over-)expression of key
proteins in signaling pathways of interest, e.g., estrogen
receptor (ER) or HER2 in breast cancer, or identify DNA
mutations (e.g., in the PIK3CA gene) or structural changes
(like HER2 coding gene ampliﬁcation) in genes encoding

Computational Models to Identify Tumor-Driving Pathways

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Major assumptions
The key assumption in the Bayesian pathway model we present is that functional activity of a signaling pathway is determined by
activity of its respective transcription complex, while the latter can be inferred from mRNA expression data of its transcriptional
target genes.
Furthermore, we assumed that the oncogenic signaling pathway driving tumor growth is not transiently and dynamically
activated, but long term or even irreversibly. Hence, the model was developed for interpretation of a static cellular condition, and
complex dynamic pathway features were not incorporated.
Finally, to handle the noisy characteristics of mRNA expression data from microarrays, as well as additional unknown biologic
factors, we modeled signaling pathways in a probabilistic manner using Bayesian networks.
Equations
The main equations related to our Bayesian models describe probabilistic relations between different types of nodes.
Conditional probability tables describing the relation between transcription complex node TC and target gene nodes TGi
are given by Equation 1, and between each target gene node TGi and its respective probeset nodes PSi,j by Equations 2a and
2b.

for proteins that directly inﬂuence signaling pathway activity. However, though associated with response to targeted
drugs (hormonal therapy and trastuzumab in example
cases ER and HER2, respectively), such tests do not provide
conclusive information on the functional activity status of
the associated signaling pathways (4).
Around 10 major oncogenic signaling pathways play a
role in tumor growth and metastasis: ER and androgen
receptor pathways, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (activated by
multiple growth factor receptors, like HER2, EGFR), canonical Wnt, Notch, Hedgehog, TGFb, NF-kB, VEGF, RAS/
MAPK/ERK, and FGF signaling pathways (5); see also Supplementary Major Oncogenic Signaling Pathways. Wholegenome and transcriptome analysis methods, like DNA and
RNA sequencing and microarray technologies, are in principle capable of producing all data necessary to extract
information on signaling pathway activity from cancer
tissue samples, on the premise that adequate software is
available to interpret the highly complex data (6). This has
proved to be a tremendous challenge, and most efforts are
directed toward identiﬁcation of genotypic changes, instead
of using the transcriptome to provide information on the
functional phenotype of the cancer cell—which is determined in concert by both genotype and microenvironment
of cancer cells (7).
We describe the development and partial clinical validation
of a new type of knowledge-based probabilistic computational
modeling framework for oncogenic cell signaling pathways,
which enables functional assessment of pathway activity in
individual tissue samples based on quantitative transcriptome
data as input. The models have been built using Affymetrix HGU133Plus2.0 data, but can be calibrated to other quantitative
mRNA data formats like RNA sequencing or other microarray
types. First models of canonical Wnt and ER pathways are
presented as proof of principle for prediction of pathway
activity, therapy response, and prognosis in patients with
cancer.

Materials and Methods
Development of Bayesian models for signal
transduction pathways
Our signal transduction pathway modeling approach is based
on inferring pathway activity from the expression proﬁle of its
target genes using probabilistic Bayesian network inference.
Bayesian networks were built using the Bayes Net Toolbox for
MATLAB, as detailed in Supplementary Methods. The Bayesian
network structure used as a basis for our modeling approach
(Fig. 1) is a simpliﬁed model of the transcriptional program of a
cellular signal transduction pathway, consisting of three types of
nodes: (i) transcription complex TC (with states 'absent' and
'present'), (ii) target genes TGi (with states 'down' and 'up'), and
(iii) microarray probesets PSi,j (with states 'low' and 'high') corresponding to target genes. The model describes (i) how expression
of target genes depends on transcription complex activation and
(ii) how probeset intensities in turn depend on expression of the
respective target genes. For the latter, probeset intensities are
taken from frozen Robust Multi-array Analysis preprocessed
Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2.0 microarrays, widely available from
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo)
and ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress); an overview of
used datasets is provided in Supplementary Table S3.
As our pathway models are a simpliﬁcation of signaling pathway biology and as biologic measurements are typically noisy,

we opted for a probabilistic approach, meaning that relationships
(i) between transcription complex and target genes and (ii)
between target genes and their respective probesets are
described in probabilistic terms. Furthermore, we assumed that
the oncogenic signaling pathway driving tumor growth is not
transiently and dynamically activated, but long term or even
irreversibly. Hence, the model was developed for interpretation of
a static cellular condition, and complex dynamic pathway features were not incorporated.
Once the Bayesian network model has been built and
calibrated for a particular signaling pathway (sketched below
and further detailed in Supplementary Methods), the model
can be used on microarray data of a new tumor sample by
entering probeset measurements as observations in the bottom layer, and inferring backwards in the model the activity
probability of the transcription complex. Hence, this latter
probability is the primary read-out used to indicate pathway
activity, which can be translated into odds of the pathway
being active by taking the ratio of the probability of being active
versus inactive (i.e., odds are given by p/(1p) if p is the
predicted probability of being active).

data. For the latter, we used microarray data either from cell
line experiments with deﬁned active and inactive pathway
settings (Wnt and ER pathway) or from patient samples with
known pathway activity status (Wnt pathway only). The resulting conditional probability tables are given by:

Target gene selection
For optimal performance, the Bayesian network models
should contain (only) direct target genes of the respective
pathways. Unfortunately, pathway databases such as KEGG
(www.genome.jp/kegg) and Biocarta (www.biocarta.com) are
fairly incomplete and inconsistent on this aspect (8). Hence, we
manually selected target genes based on extensive scientiﬁc
evidence for each individual gene being a direct target gene of
the respective transcription complex, including promotor region
motif analysis, transcription factor–binding experiments, and
differential expression analysis. For Wnt, extensive research at
the Hubrecht Institute over the past decades (9–12) culminated
in a list of 34 "bona ﬁde" target genes listed in Supplementary
Table S1. For ER, we extensively investigated available literature,
as detailed further in the Supplementary ER Pathway Target
Gene Selection, yielding the 27 genes in Supplementary Table S2.
These numbers of genes are on the one hand low enough to give
speciﬁc results, but large enough to get robust models.

In these tables, the variables ALi,j, AHi,j, PLi,j, and PHi,j indicate
the number of calibration samples with an absent (A) or
present (P) transcription complex that have a low (L) or high
(H) probeset intensity, respectively. Dummy counts have been
added to avoid extreme probabilities of 0 and 1. For more
details on the model construction, we refer to the Supplementary Bayesian Network Construction.

Model calibration
The probabilistic relations in the Bayesian network models need to be made quantitative to allow for quantitative
probabilistic reasoning. To improve generalization behavior
across tissue types, we manually set parameters describing
the probabilistic relationships (i) between transcription
complex and target genes using the following table:
A: for upregulated target genes

Statistical tests
Statistical tests, generation of Kaplan–Meier curves, and other
graphics were performed using R (13). Generally, one-sided tests
were used because the expected sign of a relation is known.

Results
Initial validation of the Wnt pathway model
Two instances of the Wnt model were created, a ﬁrst one for
initial proof of concept using cell line data for calibration, and a
second one using a larger calibration dataset with patient data,
with the advantage of better reﬂecting the variation encountered across patient samples.
The ﬁrst Wnt model was calibrated on data from 12 samples
of a Wnt abrogation experiment on an LS174T colon cancer cell
line (GSE18560; ref. 14), of which six have an active Wnt pathway
and six an inactivated Wnt pathway. For initial proof of concept,
this model was tested on a dataset with 32 normal colon tissue
samples and 32 colon adenoma samples from patients
(GSE8671; ref. 11). The Wnt pathway is thought to be active in
colon adenoma and inactive in normal intestinal tissue (15),
and Fig. 2A shows that this is almost perfectly predicted by our
model. Although two of the 32 adenoma samples are predicted
to have an inactive Wnt pathway, if the threshold is set at odds of
1:1, the difference with normal colon samples is highly distinctive. Note that reported odds get as large as a million to one,
which is due to the model using 34 genes (83 probesets in total),
so although one gene may give quite noisy information, combining 34 genes gives quite conﬁdent predictions.

Wnt-inactive surgical colon cancer samples may be explained by
cancer tissue heterogeneity and abnormal gene promoter methylation associated with more advanced cancer, or the surgeryassociated sampling procedure may have resulted in mRNA
degradation and unreliable microarray results (7, 17). Such
factors may interfere with the expected Wnt target gene mRNA
proﬁle and reduce sensitivity of our current model. Indeed and
illustratively, when our model was applied to the transcriptome
of Wnt-active colon cancer cell line HCT116, in which speciﬁc
Wnt target genes are methylated (18), the model predicted an
inactive Wnt pathway (odds 8:1, data not shown).
Above results provide evidence that the model can identify
active versus inactive Wnt pathway state in tumors arising
from the colon epithelial cell type used to develop and calibrate
the model.

colon carcinoma obtained by surgery (dark green); corresponding
control intestinal tissue samples (n ¼ 44) consist of microdissected distal

Because the ﬁrst calibration dataset has limited diversity, and
ground truth information on Wnt pathway activity is in principle
known for normal colon and adenoma, a second model was
calibrated using the 32 normal colon samples and 32 colon
adenoma samples from GSE8671 (11), and this model was used
for the rest of the Wnt experiments reported in this article.
Wnt pathway in colon cancer
In general, in colon tumors, adenomatous polyposis coli
(APC) tumor suppressor activity is absent due to loss of functional APC alleles, which is associated with active Wnt signaling,
providing an excellent opportunity for clinical evaluation of the
Wnt model (15). In dataset GSE20916 (Fig. 2B; ref. 16), all cancer
and microdissected adenoma samples obtained through colonoscopy, as well as most (32 of 36) surgically resected colon
carcinoma samples were predicted by our model to have an
active Wnt pathway (97%, n ¼ 101), whereas all normal colon
tissue samples (n ¼ 44) were predicted Wnt inactive. The four

Use of the Wnt model in tumors of other tissue origin
The aim of our models is to enable wide diagnostic usage
across tumors of different cellular origins. Although direct target
genes are transcribed by induced activity of one or more
pathway-speciﬁc transcription factors binding to their respective gene response elements, indirect target genes are more likely
to depend on additional cellular proteins for their transcription,
increasing the likelihood of cell type–speciﬁc effects on expression regulation. For this reason, gene selection used to build the
models focused on direct pathway target genes. To evaluate this
premise of relative tissue-type independent functioning, we
subsequently tested the model on other tumor types.
Liver cancer
In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoblastoma,
heterozygous somatic mutations (or deletions) in the third
coding exon (codons 32, 33, 34, 37, 41, and 45) of the b-catenin
(CTNNB1) gene have been frequently identiﬁed, resulting in
substitution (or loss) of an amino acid, which may be associated with aberrant activation of the Wnt pathway (19–21).
Dataset GSE9843 (22) contains 91 liver cancer tissue samples, of which 27 contain a b-catenin gene mutation, 60 possess
wild-type b-catenin, and four are unknown. Furthermore, 31 of
the 91 samples scored positive for nuclear b-catenin staining,
55 negative, and ﬁve unknown. Interestingly, correlation
between b-catenin mutation status and nuclear staining is
not signiﬁcant in this dataset (OR ¼ 2.3; one-sided Fisher exact
test, P ¼ 0.07), illustrating the difﬁculty to get ground truth
information on Wnt pathway activity in these samples, due to
lack of a reliable test.
Chiang and colleagues (22) applied hierarchical clustering
based on mRNA microarray data of the 91 samples of GSE9843,
yielding ﬁve groups labeled "unannotated," "polysomy chr7,"
"inﬂammation," "proliferation," and "CTNNB1." Despite its
label, the latter group of 24 samples only contains 16 of the
27 samples with a b-catenin mutation, and 14 of the 31 samples
with a positive staining. The results of our Wnt pathway model
on this dataset are shown in Fig. 3A. In the CTNNB1 group, 83%
(20 of 24) of the samples are predicted to have an active Wnt
pathway, versus 26% (6 of 23) in the proliferation group and 0%
in the other three groups. In addition, although b-catenin
mutation status and staining were not signiﬁcantly correlated,

Detailed Liver Cancer Results on GSE9843).
Analysis of data from a second dataset of hepatocellular
carcinoma samples (GSE6764; ref. 23) with unknown mutational status yielded an increased incidence of Wnt activity in
patients with relatively more malignant tumors, as seven of the
27 early HCC, advanced HCC, and very advanced HCC samples
were predicted to have an active Wnt pathway, compared with
none in the very early HCC and nonmalignant sample groups
(Fig. 3B, one-sided Fisher exact test, P ¼ 4.5e4).
Medulloblastoma
In medulloblastoma, a subset of tumors is known to possess
an activating mutation in the b-catenin gene (24). We applied
our model in a blinded manner to the medulloblastoma dataset
from Kool and colleagues (n ¼ 62, GSE10327; ref. 24), and
successfully identiﬁed all samples with a Wnt pathway–acti-

vating b-catenin mutation (Fig. 4). In another medulloblastoma dataset (n ¼ 40, GSE12992; ref. 25), the Wnt model also
correctly identiﬁed the four samples with a driving b-catenin
mutation against 36 without (data not shown). These two
datasets show perfect performance of the model in this tumor
type with 100% sensitivity and 100% speciﬁcity.
Breast cancer
In patients with breast cancer, direct Wnt-activating gene
mutations are generally not present, except for a few rare
metaplastic breast cancer cases (26). Rather, activation of the
Wnt pathway has been indicated by circumstantial evidence in
patients with triple-negative or basal-type breast cancer, most
likely induced by interaction between the cancer cell and its
microenvironment (27).
Two datasets were used for analysis of Wnt pathway activity
within breast cancer subtypes: GSE12276 (28) and GSE21653
(29); see Fig. 5A and B. Using mRNA data, patient samples in
these datasets were subtyped according to Desmedt and
colleagues (30) and Perou and colleagues (31), respectively.
Despite the difference in subtyping approach, Wnt pathway
activity was very comparable, with an active Wnt pathway in
30% (21 of 65 and 21 of 75, respectively) of basal-type cancer
samples, versus only 7% (15 of 139 and 9 of 191, respectively) in
other breast cancer subtype samples (one-sided Fisher exact
test, P ¼ 2.7e4 and 4.8e7, respectively).
Taken together, the above results provide initial evidence
that the Wnt model performs well on a variety of tumors
without requiring additional training steps on the different cell
types of origin.
Initial validation of the ER pathway model
The ER pathway model was calibrated on data from eight
samples of the breast cancer cell line MCF7, of which four were
deprived from estrogen and four were stimulated with 25
nmol/L E2 (GSE8597; ref. 32), yielding an inactive and an active
ER pathway, respectively. Estradiol concentrations are typically around 0.5 nmol/L in normal breast tissue, but elevated
in breast cancer to around 2 nmol/L (33). As a result, the 25

approach from Desmedt and colleagues (30) as luminal A (green), luminal B (dark blue), HER2 (orange), and basal (red). All patients within this dataset suffered a
relapse (median time to recurrence, 21 months; range, 0–115 months). The ordering of samples within each group is different in the two graphs; only ﬁve of the 204

ref. 29) subtyped according to Perou's subtyping scheme (31), as luminal A (green), luminal B (dark blue), HER2 (orange), basal (red), and normal-like (light
blue). The ordering of samples within each group is different in the two graphs; only four of the 266 samples have both an active Wnt and ER pathway. E and F, results

nmol/L model may be slightly less sensitive than desired, but
still useful for a ﬁrst analysis.
An initial validation of the ER pathway model was performed
on MCF7 breast cancer cell lines with and without a knockdown of the gene encoding for ER (from datasets GSE10890 and
GSE37820, only published at GEO). All knockdown samples
(n ¼ 8) were predicted to have an inactive ER pathway, whereas
all other MCF7 samples (n ¼ 28) were predicted to have an
active ER pathway (data not shown). In addition, in the cancer
cell line encyclopedia (GSE36133; ref. 34), in all 861 cancer cell
lines other than breast cancer, the ER pathway was predicted to
be inactive (data not shown), indicating a very high speciﬁcity
of the current model for ER pathway activity in breast cancer.
Furthermore, running the pathway model on replicate experiments from datasets E-MTAB-37 (35) and GSE23593 (36)
showed good reproducibility of predictions (Supplementary
Table S4 and Supplementary Fig. S1).

Next, we applied the ER pathway model to the same two
datasets of patients with breast cancer used above: GSE12276
(28) and GSE21653 (29); Fig. 5C and D, respectively. The ﬁgures
show an active ER pathway in 41% (38 of 102 and 61 of 138,
respectively) of luminal-type patients, versus only 4% (3 of 102
and 7 of 128, respectively) in other breast cancer subtype
samples (one-sided Fisher exact test, P ¼ 1.3e10 and 3.7e14,
respectively). The ﬁve HER2-type patients with predicted
active ER pathway had scored positive for ER and/or progesterone receptor (PR) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining.
All basal-type breast cancer samples were predicted to have an
inactive ER pathway.
If patient samples are grouped according to ER IHC status
(Fig. 5E and F), we observed in datasets GSE12276 and GSE21653
an active ER pathway in 39% (27 of 88 and 67 of 150, respectively)
of ER-positive tumors, versus practically none (1 of 77 and 0 of
113, respectively) of the ER-negative tumors.

Initial assessment of prognostic value of the ER pathway
model
Although the pathway models have been developed and
trained to assess pathway activity to predict therapy response,
we also tested to what extent they can have prognostic value.
To this end, survival time analysis was performed on a dataset
of 164 patients with ER-positive breast cancer that all received
(only) adjuvant tamoxifen treatment for 5 years (Fig. 7; combined datasets GSE6532 & GSE9195; refs. 38, 39). The analysis
was restricted to the ﬁrst 5 years only, as tamoxifen treatment
was limited to 5 years. As expected, patients with an active ER
pathway have a better survival prognosis on tamoxifen treatment than patients for which the ER pathway is predicted
inactive (one-sided log-rank test P ¼ 0.034).
These results indicate that the ER pathway model may also
have clinical utility in assessing prognosis in individual
patients with breast cancer, even though it has not been
developed for this purpose.

Discussion
With a few exceptions, e.g., HER2 and ER protein staining in
breast cancer, most companion diagnostic assays to predict
therapy response focus on identiﬁcation of a tumor-speciﬁc

ER pathway activity and tamoxifen sensitivity
To link ER pathway activity to tamoxifen sensitivity, we
analyzed dataset GSE21618 (37), containing samples from tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant MCF7 breast cancer cell lines (all ER
positive) treated with estradiol. In particular, we took the samples
that had ﬁrst been deprived of estrogen, and next been stimulated
for up to 48 hours. Figure 6 shows the resulting probability of ER
pathway activity as a function of stimulation time. Clearly,
tamoxifen-sensitive cell lines quickly respond to estrogen stimulation, with probabilities steeply increasing toward 1, whereas
tamoxifen-resistant cell lines respond to a lesser extent.

genetic defect, associated with activation of a speciﬁc oncogenic
signaling pathway (4, 40, 41). If the test result is positive, the
associated signaling pathway is assumed to be active and
driving tumor growth. Although a recent study by MD Anderson
provides proof of principle that mutation-based identiﬁcation
of the tumor-driving signaling pathway improves therapy
choice, it also illustrates that such a DNA-based companion
diagnostic approach is unlikely to provide the complete answer,
as in this study therapy response increased from 5% to only 27%
(41). Indeed, it is clear that signaling pathway activation status
(the functional "phenotype" of the cell) is determined not only
by errors in the cancer cell (epi-)genome, but to a large extent by
interactions between the cancer cell and its microenvironment
(1, 32, 42). To assess the phenotype of the cell, in addition to the
genotype, we presented a method to interpret cancer tissue
transcriptome data as direct quantitative "output" of active
signal transduction pathway(s), using knowledge-based Bayesian models. The pathway "output" is represented by transcribed
pathway-speciﬁc target genes, which need to be known to
create the models. So far, the data input for the models is from
Affymetrix HG-U133Plus2.0 microarrays, but an important
advantage of this type of knowledge-based models is that they
can be easily calibrated to other input modalities, such as other
array types, RNA sequencing, or dedicated multiplex PCR
assays. We provided proof of principle that the models when
trained on a limited number of cell line samples, or if available
patient samples, already perform very well and robustly identify
active oncogenic signal transduction pathway(s) in individual
tissue samples obtained from a variety of malignancies.
For the Wnt pathway, our pathway model analysis results for
adenoma, colon carcinoma, and medulloblastoma were in full
concordance with existing evidence on Wnt pathway activation in these tumor types (15, 24, 42).
For other tumors such as primary liver and breast cancer, no
easy "ground truth" with respect to activity status of the Wnt

Computational Models to Identify Tumor-Driving Pathways

pathway is available, but this pathway is likely to play a role in at
least a number of cases (42–45). In agreement, our model
identiﬁed an active Wnt pathway in the majority of liver cancer
samples with, and a minority without, a b-catenin mutation.
Identiﬁcation of an active Wnt pathway in the absence of a
b-catenin mutation may be due to the presence of other pathway-activating mutations in genes like APC, AXIN1, and AXIN2
(46), or by paracrine Wnt activation (47, 48). Indeed, a signiﬁcant
correlation was found between model-predicted Wnt pathway
activity and staining of nuclear b-catenin, presumably the active
form of the Wnt pathway transcription factor. On the other hand,
the presence of a b-catenin mutation does not necessarily mean
that the pathway is activated, and in the cases in which the model
did not detect Wnt activation despite a b-catenin mutation,
another pathway may have taken the lead in tumor growth, for
example induced by the microenvironment.
In breast cancer, Wnt activity was detected by the model in
around one third of triple-negative or basal-type samples,
which agrees with available evidence on a role for Wnt activity
in this breast cancer subtype (43). In only very rare cases of
breast cancer, a potentially Wnt-activating gene mutation has
been found, suggesting that Wnt activity is most likely induced
by paracrine interactions between cancer cells and their
microenvironment. With a number of Wnt-targeting drugs in
the pipeline of pharmaceutical companies, development of a
reliable test to identify Wnt pathway activity in this cancer
subtype with highly unfavorable prognosis is considered high
priority (44, 49, 50), as b-catenin staining is not reliable enough
to indicate Wnt pathway activity (50). Analysis of transcriptome data by our model is expected to provide information on
Wnt activity in breast cancer, but ﬁnal validation will require a
clinical trial with an appropriate Wnt-inhibiting drug.
Other approaches have been directed toward assessing the
phenotype of cancer by analyzing its transcriptome. To deduce
pathway activity from tissue transcriptome data, most pathway analysis approaches use pathway information from databases such as KEGG (www.genome.jp/kegg) and Biocarta
(www.biocarta.com) that mainly list genes encoding signaling
proteins. Furthermore, they invariably extrapolate quantitative
mRNA levels to levels of corresponding signaling proteins,
followed by a search for a role of the transcript-encoded
protein in a signaling pathway, which is subsequently deﬁned
as an active pathway (42, 44, 51). This approach is intrinsically
ﬂawed for pathway activation analysis because induction of an
mRNA transcript coding for a component of a signaling
pathway is not reliably correlated to the actual translated
protein level and, even less, to the activation status of the
encoded signaling protein, which requires additional posttranslational protein modiﬁcations.
As expected, our approach leads to a different interpretation
result of mRNA proﬁling data than conventional pathway analysis approaches. For example, we have run gene set enrichment
analysis (52), using the accompanying curated canonical pathways, to identify the pathways differentially activated between
the normal colon and colon adenoma samples from dataset
GSE8671 (11), but none of the Wnt-related pathways was
identiﬁed with a signiﬁcant P value after correction for multiple
testing (see Supplementary Table S5 in Supplementary Meth-

www.aacrjournals.org

ods). Furthermore, another common pathway analysis approach, as presented by Skrzypczak and colleagues (16), in which
ﬁrst a list of differentially expressed genes is determined and next
pathway sets are analyzed for overrepresentation of this gene
list, did not identify the Wnt pathway as signiﬁcantly different
between normal colon and colon neoplasms—while our results
were highly convincing about Wnt pathway activation status.
From the results on tamoxifen-sensitive and -resistant cell
line data, it is inferred that the ER model can successfully detect
ER activity in breast cancer cells. Being positive for the ER as
measured by IHC or microarray analysis seems to be a necessary but not sufﬁcient condition for ER pathway activity as
assessed by the model. Because the model was trained on data
from cell line experiments performed with a relatively high
dose of estradiol (25 nmol/L), it cannot be excluded that the
current model lacks to some extent in sensitivity to detect all
samples with an active ER pathway. However, the ﬁnding that
only a subgroup of ER-positive patients seemed to have an
active ER pathway agrees with the common clinical observation that a number of ER-positive patients are primary resistant to hormonal therapy. Moreover, the model identiﬁed ERpositive patients treated with hormonal adjuvant therapy but
with an inactive ER pathway as having a worse prognosis. This
is in agreement with the concept that patients with the ER
pathway driving tumor growth are more likely to beneﬁt from
hormonal adjuvant therapy.
With respect to the prediction of hormonal therapy response
in patients with breast cancer, Symmans and colleagues (53)
have described an mRNA proﬁle of 165 ER-related genes, called
the sensitive to endocrine therapy (SET) index. In contrast with
the ER target genes in our model, genes underlying the SET
index were not selected based on evidence for them being
target genes of the ER transcription factor, but on increased
expression levels found in ER-positive patients. The SET index
was shown to identify patients with node-negative disease that
have a good prognosis when treated with adjuvant hormonal
therapy, as well as patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy who have a high risk at relapse when subsequently
treated with adjuvant hormonal treatment. Its predictive value
may be partly contributed to the incorporation of six of the ER
target genes used in our model.
We hypothesize that in ER-positive patients with an inactive
ER pathway, other pathways such as Wnt or Hedgehog, associated with more aggressive behavior and worse outcome, may
actually have been driving tumor growth (1, 54, 55). This is in
agreement with the reported decline in SET index with advancing pathologic cancer stage, despite ER positivity, suggesting
decreasing tumor dependency on an active ER pathway (53).
Second, a high gene expression grade index, developed in a
similar way as the SET index, also identiﬁes subpopulations of
ER-positive breast cancer with unfavorable prognosis (56).
Taken together, these results strongly suggest that conventional
quantiﬁcation of nuclear ER IHC staining is not sufﬁciently
speciﬁc in detecting functional ER pathway activity. According
to pathologist guidelines, ER activity in a breast cancer sample
is inferred from the presence of positive ER staining, with a
minimum of 1% of ER-positive tumor nuclei as a threshold level.
Such staining assays have an estimated 20% error rate due to

multiple factors that inﬂuence reliability, among them nonstandardized staining procedures and subjective interpretation
(42, 50, 57). In contrast, microarray assays are quite standardized, and the model-based analysis uses a number of ER target
genes interpreted in a weighted manner to calculate a probability of pathway activation, instead of ER as single variable as is
the case in IHC testing. These conditions are promising for a
more robust prediction of ER pathway activity.

pathways, ultimately providing a multipathway analysis suite
for identiﬁcation of both the major active pathway and potential underlying resistance pathways, applicable to tissue samples from a number of tumor types. Upon further clinical
validation, currently under way, the expected main clinical
utility of the described pathway models lies in therapy
response prediction and monitoring in neoadjuvant and metastatic settings.

Clinical utility of pathway models
The fact that the Bayesian network models are knowledgeand not data mining-based has several advantages. First, the
models seemed to be well applicable to data analysis of
multiple unrelated tumor types and this property allows use
of the models for diagnostics purpose in cancers of different
cell types of origin. Nevertheless, it is expected that the models
can be further optimized with respect to sensitivity and
speciﬁcity by including target genes that are speciﬁcally
expressed in the tissue type of origin of the tumor. Such
adaptation could, for example, entail adjusting the conditional
probabilities and/or adding new nodes for novel target genes.
Another advantage is the relatively easy translation of the
model to another data format, such as Illumina DASL microarrays, RNA sequencing, or PCR-based testing. Finally, the
remarkable reproducibility of the pathway model results
across multiple (mostly public) datasets of a speciﬁc tumor
type, generated at completely different hospitals and locations,
demonstrates the robustness of this modeling approach for
individual patient diagnostic use. The pathway model series
will be extended to include all major oncogenic signaling
