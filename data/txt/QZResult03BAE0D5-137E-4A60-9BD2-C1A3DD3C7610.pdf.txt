Abstract
High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) present in human
prostate epithelia are an important etiologic factor in prostate
cancer (CaP) occurrence, recurrence, and progression. Androgen induces ROS production in the prostate by a yet unknown
mechanism. Here, to the best of our knowledge, we report for
the first time that androgen induces an overexpression of
spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase, the rate-limiting
enzyme in the polyamine oxidation pathway. As prostatic
epithelia produce a large excess of polyamines, the androgeninduced polyamine oxidation that produces H2O2 could be a
major reason for the high ROS levels in the prostate epithelia. A
small molecule polyamine oxidase inhibitor N,N ’-butanedienyl
butanediamine (MDL 72,527 or CPC-200) effectively blocks
androgen-induced ROS production in human CaP cells, as well
as significantly delays CaP progression and death in animals
developing spontaneous CaP. These data show that polyamine
oxidation is not only a major pathway for ROS production in
prostate, but inhibiting this pathway also successfully delays
CaP progression. [Cancer Res 2009;69(19):7689–95]

Introduction
Advanced hormone refractory metastatic prostate cancer (CaP)
is a major cause of cancer deaths among U.S. men. Most CaP
patients at the time of initial diagnosis have androgen-dependent
tumors that regress quickly after radical prostatectomy or radiation
therapy. Unfortunately, in f15% of the patients, the cancer recurs
within a few years as an advanced hormone refractory and oftenmetastatic disease. Most commonly used cancer chemotherapeutic
agents have little effect against advanced, metastatic CaP.
Therefore, development of agents to prevent CaP occurrence,
recurrence, and progression to the advanced stage is warranted.
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as hydrogen peroxide, superoxide, hydroxyl-free radical, and nitric oxide levels are relatively

higher in prostate epithelial cells than are in most other tissues
(1, 2). Direct evidence linking ROS with an increase in tumor
development in the prostate has been established (3–5). The ability
of ROS to alter growth or apoptosis-related genes either by direct
mutagenic effects on DNA or by alterations in gene expression and
cellular signaling suggest a potential role for ROS in both initiation
and progression of CaP (1–16). Oberley and colleagues (16) performed immunohistochemistry to analyze human malignant and
normal prostate tissues in archival paraffin blocks. They reported
that oxidative stress-induced enzymes and oxidative damage to
DNA bases are relatively more abundant in malignant CaP
compared with that in normal human prostate tissues. Ho and
her colleagues (17, 18) used similar methods to confirm that the
ROS-induced damage in spontaneously formed prostate neoplasm
of transgenic adenocarcinoma of mouse prostate (TRAMP) animals
are relatively more than that in normal prostatic lumen of the same
animal. It has also been shown that ROS play a key role in the
androgen-independent growth of androgen-dependent CaP cells
(19). Therefore, understanding the biochemical pathway that
modulates cellular ROS levels could yield a novel and effective
therapeutic strategy to delay or even prevent CaP occurrence,
recurrence, and progression. Androgen induces oxidative stress
by producing ROS in normal and malignant prostatic epithelial
cells (5, 10–15). The results initially published from our laboratory
(10–14) have been independently confirmed by other laboratories
(15, 18). Ho and colleagues (18) conclusively showed that androgen
induces ROS production in rat prostatic tissues. The biochemical
mechanism of androgen-induced ROS production in the prostate,
however, has not yet been reported.
Our DNA microarray data from androgen-treated and untreated
LNCaP human CaP cells3 suggest that androgen induces overexpression of spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT)
mRNA. SSAT is the first enzyme in polyamine catabolic pathway.
Polyamines are essential components of the seminal fluid. Large
excess of polyamines are produced and secreted by prostatic
epithelial cells and polyamine catabolism produces the ROS H2O2
(20–22). Thus, an induction of a rate-limiting enzyme of the
polyamine catabolic pathway may be a key factor in producing a
high level of ROS in the prostatic tissue.
Here, we report data from quantitative reverse transcription–
PCR (qRT-PCR): lack of androgen-induced ROS production in cells

transfected with small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SSAT, SSAT
enzyme activity, and cellular polyamine levels in LNCaP cells. These
data confirm that androgen induces both SSAT expression and
enzyme activity in androgen-treated LNCaP human CaP cells. A
small molecule inhibitor of N1-acetyl polyamine oxidase (APAO)
N,N ’-butanedienyl butanediamine (MDL 72,527 or CPC-200; refs. 23,
24) completely blocks androgen-induced ROS production in LNCaP
cells, as well as in the prostatic lumen of the TRAMP animals. CPC200 treatment also inhibited tumor growth and significantly
increased the life expectancy of TRAMP animals. These data
clearly show that polyamine oxidation is the major biochemical
pathway for generating oxidative stress in the prostatic epithelial
cells. Blocking polyamine oxidation is a valid strategy for lowering
oxidative stress in the prostate and prevents CaP progression,
showing a direct link between prostatic ROS and CaP progression.

Materials and Methods
Materials
CPC-200 has been synthesized by Prof. Patrick Woster following a
previously published procedure (23). The LNCaP human prostate carcinoma
cell line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. All
enzymes and assay kits were purchased from manufacturers described in
the Methods (see below).

Methods
Tissue culture. Cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5%
fetal bovine serum, nonessential amino acids, and 1% streptomycinpenicillin in a humidified 95% air/5% CO2 atmosphere. Cells were harvested
by treatment for 3 to 5 min with STV (saline A, 0.05% trypsin, 0.02% EDTA)
at 37jC following a previously published procedure (12).
Androgen deprivation. Cells collected for experiments were counted
and cultured in medium containing 4% charcoal-stripped serum plus 1%
nonstripped serum (F1/C4) for 48 h. This combination of stripped and
nonstripped serum was previously shown to sufficiently deplete androgen
content while limiting adverse growth effects not related to hormone
depletion that occur with the use of 5% stripped serum (12). Concurrently
in each experiment, cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a
density of 2,500 cells per well in 100 AL medium for the measurement of
ROS as an indicator of redox status. DNA levels were measured as an
indicator of growth (see below). LNCaP cells were seeded in F1/C4 at a
density of 1  106 cells per 10-cm tissue culture plate for protein estimation
for Western blot analysis (see below). Protein estimation was carried out
following standard procedure previously published from our laboratory (10).
qRT-PCR. Total RNA from LNCaP cultures was isolated using the RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer-supplied protocol. For qRT-PCR
analysis, cDNA was produced from total RNA using Superscript (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qRT-PCR was performed
using the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.), according
to the manufacturer’s instructions, with thermal cycling parameters of
1 cycle of 95jC for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of a 96jC denaturation for
15 s and a 60jC annealing/extension for 1 min using an iCycler (Bio-Rad),
following a published procedure (10). To control for variability in efficiency
of cDNA synthesis between samples, cDNA levels of the genes under
investigation were normalized to the cDNA levels of glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). PCR primer sequences were
designed using Oligo 5.0 software (National Biosciences) and synthesized
at the University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center. The PCR primer set
sequences were as follows: GAPDH forward primer, AAA TTC CAT GGC
ACC GTC AA and reverse primer, TCT CGC TCC TGG AAG ATG GT; SSAT
forward primer, CGA GCT CGA GAG GGG CCT GGT CCG CAA A and
reverse primer, GTT CGA ATT CTA AAG CTT TGG AAT GGG TGC TCA.
siRNA transfection and isolation of stable LNCaP clone siSSAT.
Construction of pSF1-H1-siSSAT vector. Stable expression of siRNA for
SSAT was used to suppress SSAT expression in LNCaP cells. Oligonucleo-

tides for silencing SSAT were designed based on the published sequence
(25). The oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen. The annealed
oligonucleotides were inserted into pSF1 vector (SBI; System Biosciences).
Transduction of LNCaP cells by pPACKaged pSIF-H1-siSSAT or pSIFH1-siLuc. LNCaP cells stably expressing pSIF-H1-siSSAT vector were
established using lentiviral system from SBI, following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, the day before transfection, 5  106 293NT cells were
seeded in a 10-cm plate in complete medium without antibiotics. The
following day, 2 Ag expression vector pSIF-H1 carrying siSSAT or vector
control (pSIF-H1-siLuc) were separately mixed with 10 Ag pPACK (Packaging
Plasmid Mix; SBI) and 30 AL of Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in medium
without serum and antibiotics. The mixture was added to 293NT cells in
2% serum without antibiotics. After overnight incubation at 37jC in a
5% CO2 incubator, the medium was replaced with fresh 2% serum containing
antibiotics, and the incubation was continued for another 48 h at 37jC in a
5% CO2 incubator. The supernatant was harvested by centrifugation at 5,000
rpm for 5 min and used for transducing 1  105 LNCaP cells, which were
plated in polylysine plate (BD Bioscience) the day before transduction.
Puromycin (Sigma; 1 Ag/mL) in complete medium was used for selection of
stably transduced cells for pSIF-H1-si SSAT and vector control. The silencing
of SSAT in these cells was verified by qRT-PCR (see below).
Reduced 2¶7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate oxidation assay. The
96-well culture plates were assayed for estimation of ROS levels in intact
cells using the fluorescent dye 2¶,7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF;
Molecular Probes, Inc.) following a published procedure (12). In brief, cell
cultures were washed with 200 AL Kreb’s Ringer buffer prewarmed to 37jC,
incubated as usual at 37jC in 100 AL Kreb’s Ringer buffer containing
10 Ag/mL ( final concentration) DCF dye for 45 min. Each 96-well culture
plate was scanned on a CytoFluor 2350 plate scanner (Applied Biosystems)
using the 485/530 nm filter excitation and emission set and then frozen at
70jC for the subsequent analysis of DNA content.
DNA assay. For DNA analysis, each culture plate frozen to 70jC was
thawed/equilibrated to room temperature in the dark. Hoechst dye was
then added to each well in 200 AL of high salt TNE buffer [10 mmol/L Tris,
1 mmol/L EDTA, 2 mol/L NaCl (pH 7.4)] following a published procedure
(12). After further incubation at room temperature for over 2 h under
protection from light, culture plates were scanned on a CytoFluor 2350
scanner using the 360/460 nm filter excitation and emission set. The DCF
fluorescence units were normalized to the Hoechst-DNA fluorescence units
for each well and used as a measure of the level of ROS being generated. The
DNA fluorescence units were also used as a measure of cell growth.
SSAT assay. SSAT assay was performed following essentially the same
procedure published elsewhere (26). Cells in monolayer were washed twice
with PBS and resuspended in 5 mmol/L HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) containing
1 mmol/L DTT. Cells were lysed by three 30-s pulses of sonication. Cell
lysates were centrifuged, and cytoplasms were collected and stored at
80jC. On the day of the assay, the cytoplasms were incubated with
150 pmol of spermidine and 500 pmol of 14C-acetyl CoA (GE Healthcare/
Amersham) in 25 AL HEPES buffer for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by
cooling in ice and by an addition of chilled 10 AL of hydroxylamine
hydrochloride and then heating in a boiling water bath. After centrifugation,
the supernatant was spotted on a phosphocellulose filter, washed, and
counted. Cytosolic protein contents were determined by Bradford method,
and the results are expressed as picomoles of acetyl spermidine synthesized
per minute per milligram protein.
Polyamine analysis. A known number of cells (>1  106) were taken
from harvested samples and centrifuged at 800  g at 4jC for 5 min. The
cells were washed twice with chilled Dulbecco’s isotonic phosphate buffer
(pH 7.4) by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm at 4jC and resuspended in the same
buffer. After the final centrifugation, the supernatant was decanted and
250 AL of 8% sulfosalicylic acid were added to the cell pellet. The cells were
sonicated, and the mixture was kept at 4jC for at least 1 h. After further
centrifugation at 8,000  g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed for
analysis following a published high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) procedure (27). Because polyamine levels vary with environmental
conditions, control cultures were sampled for each experiment.

Polyamine Oxidase Inhibitor for CaP Progression

Animals. TRAMP mice were a kind gift from Dr. Norman Greenberg, and
a new colony has been established and maintained at the University of
Wisconsin. FVB mice were obtained from Harlan Sprague-Dawley and bred
with TRAMP females to produce TRAMP  FVB[F1] mice for these studies.
Male TRAMP  FVB mice were confirmed positive for the TRAMP
transgene by PCR following published protocols (28). Animal care and use
were in accordance with protocols approved by the University of
Wisconsin-Madison School of Medicine and Public Health Animal Care
and Use Committee and the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals.

Results
Androgen induces SSAT mRNA expression. LNCaP cells
cultured in androgen-depleted medium (see Materials and
Methods) were treated for 96 hours with 0.05 and 1 nmol/L of
the androgen analogue R1881. Results published from our
laboratory have shown that 1 nmol/L R1881, which closely
resembles the androgen levels in normal male human serum,
produces high ROS levels in LNCaP cells after a 96-hour treatment,
whereas 0.05 nmol/L R1881 causes a minor decrease in cellular
ROS (10–14). We have performed qRT-PCR experiment to detect
the expression of SSAT mRNA in cells treated with 0, 0.05, and
1.0 nmol/L R1881. The expression of GAPDH mRNA has been used
as a control to normalize the qRT-PCR data. The results for the
96-hour treatment are shown in Fig. 1A. qRT-PCR data show that
f25-fold to 30-fold increase in the SSAT mRNA level only in
1.0 nmol/L R1881–treated cells and not in untreated or 0.05 nmol/L
R1881–treated cells. The time course of SSAT mRNA production
after treatment with 1 nmol/L R1881 is shown in Fig. 1B. The
induction of SSAT mRNA production has not been observed up to
48 hours and has been observed only between 48 and 72 hours of
androgen exposure. The ROS levels of LNCaP cells treated with
varying concentrations of R1881 for different times are shown in
Fig. 1C. The ROS levels do not increase for 48 hours after treatment
and start increasing only between 48- and 72-hour treatment. Thus,
these data show that the androgen-induced SSAT gene expression
that causes polyamine oxidation and ROS production runs parallel
to the time course of androgen-induced ROS production in LNCaP
cells. It is also evident that SSAT gene expression is induced only at
androgen concentration that increases ROS but not at androgen
concentration that does not increase cellular ROS.
Androgen-induced changes in cellular polyamine level
confirm an increase in SSAT enzyme activity. To test if the
increase in SSAT mRNA level also translates into higher SSAT
enzyme activity, we have tested the effect of androgen on cellular
polyamine and acetyl polyamine (Ac-polyamine) levels in untreated
LNCaP cells and cells treated with 1 nmol/L R1881 for 96 hours. We
have also pretreated the cells with 25 Amol/L APAO inhibitor CPC200 to test the efficacy in inhibiting APAO as observed by the effect
on androgen-induced changes in cellular polyamine levels. Under
our culture conditions, it has been reported that 25 Amol/L
CPC-200 completely inhibits APAO in most cell lines, including CaP
cells (23, 24). The polyamine and Ac-polyamine levels in cells
treated with 0 and 1 nmol/L R1881 for 96 h with or without
24 h pretreatment with 25 Amol/L CPC-200 are shown in Fig. 2.
R1881 (1 nmol/L) treatment for 96 hours increases putrescine and
spermidine levels by 6-fold to 10-fold, decreases spermine levels
by one-half, and markedly increases N-acetyl spermidine and
N-acetyl spermine levels that are undetectable in untreated cells.
These results confirm that androgen treatment not only increases
the SSAT mRNA level (Fig. 1) but also enhances SSAT enzyme

activity, which causes the increase in spermidine and spermine
catabolites—Ac-polyamines, putrescine, and spermidine. CPC-200
treatment alone has little effect on most cellular polyamine levels
(except for a small increase in acetyl spermine level). In 1 nmol/L
R1881–treated cells, however, CPC-200 pretreatment almost
completely blocks the R1881-induced increase in putrescine and
spermidine levels and causes 3-4–fold increase in N-acetylspermidine and N-acetyl-spermine levels without appreciably
changing spermine level. These data, in addition to a small but
significant increase in N-acetyl-spermine level in cells treated only

with CPC-200, show that 25 Amol/L CPC-200 efficiently blocks
APAO enzyme activity, thus inhibiting polyamine oxidation and
increasing cellular N-acetyl-polyamine levels. In addition, the
increase in Ac-polyamines also shows that CPC-200 alone has
little effect on the SSAT gene expression and/or SSAT enzymatic
activity in the androgen-treated cells.
Androgen-induced ROS production is relatively lower in
SSAT siRNA transfected LNCaP cells. To further confirm that
SSAT is the major player in androgen-induced ROS production in
LNCaP cells, we have constructed one LNCaP cell clone stably
transfected with siRNA against SSAT (siSSAT). The ability of the
siRNA to reduce SSAT mRNA level was first confirmed using qRTPCR. The results are shown in Fig. 3A. These data have been
normalized to the 18S rRNA level. The results show that 1 nmol/L
R1881-induced increase in SSAT mRNA level in the siSSAT clone is
nearly 80% less than that observed for 1 nmol/L R881–treated
LNCaP cells transfected with a control vector. The acetylated
polyamine levels in the vector control and siSSAT-transfected cells
are shown in Table 1. Cells expressing siSSAT show over 4.5-fold
decrease in acetylated spermidine and over 30-fold decrease in
acetylated spermine level, which confirms that the decrease in
mRNA level parallels a decrease in SSAT enzyme activity. The SSAT
enzyme activity in R1881-treated and untreated LNCaP cells, cells
transfected with a control vector, and siSSAT-transfected cells are
shown in Fig. 3B. In both wild-type LNCaP cells and cells
transfected with a control vector, the SSAT enzyme activity has
been increased by over 2-fold. In siSSAT transfected cells, however,
the enzyme activity is less than half of the other two cell lines and
the activity does not change after R1881 treatment. The effects of
1 nmol/L R1881 treatment on the ROS levels in LNCaP cells and
siSSAT clone as determined by a DCF dye oxidation assay are
shown in Fig. 3C. R1881 treatment has no significant effect on ROS

production in siSSAT clone compared with a nearly 1.5-fold
increase induced by R1881 in LNCaP cells transfected with the
control vector. The difference in percentage induction of ROS levels
in wild-type versus siSSAT clone is statistically significant with a P
value of <0.001 as determined using a two-tailed Student’s t test.
CPC-200 treatment completely blocks androgen-induced
ROS production in LNCaP cells. To test if CPC-200 treatment can
also block the androgen-induced ROS production in the wild-type
LNCaP cells, we have determined the relative changes in ROS levels
in LNCaP cells that are either untreated or pretreated for 24 h with
25 Amol/L CPC-200 and exposed to graded concentrations of R1881
for 96 h. The results of ROS measurement in CPC-200 pretreated
and untreated cells exposed to increasing androgen concentrations
are shown in Fig. 4. Data points, SDs, and P values are calculated
from the reading of six wells of a 96-well plate, wherein each plate
was run in triplicate and the experiment was repeated twice. CPC200 (25 Amol/L) pretreatment not only completely blocks the
R1881-induced ROS production, the ROS levels of CPC-200
pretreated cells are actually even lower than that of control
androgen-untreated cells. These data confirm that polyamine
catabolism is one of the major causes of the ROS production of
prostate cells in general and androgen-induced enhancement of
ROS in androgen-dependent CaP cells in particular.
We have not observed any effect of CPC-200 pretreatment on the
androgen receptor level in both androgen-treated and untreated
cells (data not shown), indicating that the decrease in cellular ROS
is not due to changes in cellular androgen receptor level in CPC200–treated cells.
CPC-200 treatment markedly reduces tumor formation
in TRAMP animals and significantly increases life expectancy.
To determine if CPC-200 treatment induced reduction in the
ROS levels and delays prostate tumor progression in vivo, we tested

of six treatments. This dose is slightly above the 20 mg/kg dose
required to completely inhibit mouse APAO enzyme activity in vivo
and is well below the maximum tolerated dose of CPC-200 in mice
(100 mg/kg daily for 14 days; ref. 24). This dose has shown no overt
toxicity and no observable side effects in mice. In our study, no
overt sign of toxicity, abnormal behavior, body weight loss, or any
other observable symptom was detectable, either short term after
each of the successive CPC-200 injections or long term until the
end of the study.
The difference in median survival time was assessed using a
Wilcoxon rank sum test. Across two independent studies that
include a total of 26 animals per arm, we have observed median
survival of 12.0 weeks versus 17.5 weeks after first treatment for
vehicle control versus CPC-200–treated mice, yielding a statistically
significant (P = 0.03) improvement in median survival by 5.5 weeks
for CPC-200–treated animals (Fig. 5). As treatment has begun at an
average age of 8 weeks in these studies, this equates to median
survival ages of f20 weeks for control and f25 weeks for CPC200–treated animals. Therefore, six injections of CPC-200 have
resulted in >25% increase in overall life expectancy.

Discussion
The data presented here conclusively show that androgeninduced activation of SSAT, the first enzyme of one major polyamine
oxidation pathway, is a key source of oxidative stress in the prostatic
lumen and is one of the major factors in prostate tumor progression.
The data establish that CPC-200, a small molecule specific inhibitor
of polyamine oxidase, cannot only block androgen-induced oxidative stress in cultured LNCaP human CaP cells but can also significantly delay prostate carcinogenesis in TRAMP  FVB animals.
These results open up a new avenue for research in CaP therapy.
The fold increase of SSAT mRNA level estimated using qRT-PCR
in siSSAT clone is nearly 80% less than that observed for wild-type
LNCaP cells (Fig. 3A). This decrease in SSAT mRNA level is
sufficient to completely block androgen-induced ROS (Fig. 3B).
Casero and colleagues (21, 22) have reported the detection,
isolation, and characterization of another inducible polyamine
oxidase (PAOh1) in human breast, colon, lung, and prostate
tumors. PAOh1 oxidizes unacetylated polyamines and also
produces H2O2. PAOh1-induced ROS production, however, does
not go through APAO pathway and has been reported to be the
primary source of ROS in breast cancer cells and not specific for
CaP metabolism. Almost complete block of androgen-induced ROS
production in SSAT mRNA silenced cells (Fig. 3B) suggests that
PAOh1 probably plays a minor role in the androgen-induced ROS
production specifically in the CaP cells.
The ability of CPC-200 treatment to reduce cellular ROS
production (Fig. 4) also shows that an overexpression of SSAT that
initiates enhanced polyamine catabolism is one of the major causes
of androgen-induced oxidative stress in androgen-dependent
human CaP cells. Because the enzyme PAOh1 is also inhibited by
CPC-200 (21, 22), some contribution of PAOh1 activity in the cellular
oxidative stress cannot be completely ruled out. It is to be noted,
however, that androgen treatment decreases cellular spermine
levels and increases cellular acetyl-polyamine level (Fig. 2). The

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (19). October 1, 2009

polyamine levels in R1881 (Fig. 2) and the reduction of ROS levels in
cells treated with 25 Amol/L CPC-200 (Fig. 4) suggest that most of
the ROS production in R1881-treated cells is due to SSAT induction
followed by oxidation of acetylated polyamines by constitutively
expressed APAO rather than a direct oxidation of spermine by
PAOh1.
It is also to be noted that CPC-200 pretreated LNCaP cells
growing in the presence of 1 nmol/L R1881 have even less ROS than
do untreated cells (Fig. 4). This suggests that the basal level of ROS
produced in LNCaP cells growing in the absence of androgen may
also be due to low grade oxidation of cellular polyamines that is
now blocked by CPC-200 treatment.
As spermine acts as a scavenger for ROS (30), androgen-induced
decrease in polyamine levels may also cause the observed increase in
ROS levels. CPC-200 (25 Amol/L) pretreatment, however, does not
reverse androgen-induced reduction of cellular spermine levels (Fig. 2),
although it completely blocks the ROS production (Fig. 4). Therefore,
R1881 induced depletion of the cellular spermine level can be ruled out
as a major contributor to the increase in the ROS levels.
Our Western analysis for androgen receptor protein expression
showed no effect of CPC-200 treatment on androgen receptor
levels (data not shown). Thus, we rule out the possibility of CPC200–induced changes in androgen receptor expression as a cause
for the changes in growth and/or ROS.
We have established preclinical efficacy of CPC-200 using the
TRAMP  FVB mouse model of prostate carcinogenesis. CPC-200
at a well-tolerated dose of 25 mg/kg given i.p. once every 2 weeks
for a total of six treatments significantly inhibited the growth of
tumors in this model as evidenced by improved survival (Fig. 5). In
our studies, the majority of mice (>90%) were sacrificed due to
reaching a predefined tumor size per our animal protocol, thus
survival is a surrogate for tumor burden and improvement in
survival thus equates with an inhibition of tumor growth by CPC200 in our TRAMP  FVB model. Therefore, the significant
5.5-week improvement (P = 0.03) in median survival for CPC-200
using this model (Fig. 5) shows the ability of CPC-200 to slow
prostate tumor growth. The efficacy of CPC-200 against prostate
tumor progression in this animal model supports the hypothesis
that polyamine oxidation and resultant increase in ROS play an
important role in prostate carcinogenesis and strongly implicates
the potential of CPC-200 as a new therapeutic agent for CaP.
Several mechanisms such as expression (or nuclear translocation) of specific transcription factors, such as hypoxia-induced
transcription factor-1a, NF-nB, activator protein-1, etc. (9, 11, 28,
29), have been suggested as a probable mode of regulation of
specific genes that may control cellular red ox status. Enhanced
mitochondrial activity (13), suppression of glutathione S-transferase-k expression, and a reduction in the level of total glutathione
specifically in CaP cells (8) have also been suggested as probable
pathways for an increase in ROS production in CaP. A direct effect
of androgen in regulating any of these pathways has yet to be
shown. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
androgen-induced regulation of a rate-limiting enzyme of a specific
biochemical pathway (polyamine catabolism) that is directly
related to cellular oxidative stress induction. Because of the high
levels of polyamines present in human prostate and CaP cells, this
pathway seems all the more important in regulating oxidative
stress in the prostate gland and specifically in CaP cells. The
spermine level in LNCaP cells reported here is by far the highest
among most of the cell lines reported thus far (ref. 31 and related
references therein). A higher basal metabolism of spermine may be

one reason for the relatively higher ROS level in LNCaP cells
compared with other cell lines (12).
A close inspection of the SSAT gene sequence reveals that there
are four glucocorticoids response elements (GRE) but no androgen
response element (ARE) upstream of the SSAT transcription start
site. It has been reported that androgen receptor binds and
activates GRE containing promoters (32). Its efficiency of activating
promoters containing GRE, however, is much lower than that of
activating promoters containing ARE. This may be one reason
why the SSAT activation and the consequent ROS production
was observed only when the cells were treated with high
concentration (z0.5 nmol/L) of R1881 but not with low
concentration (V0.05 nmol/L) of R1881 (ref. 12; Fig. 1).
Lastly, a decrease in cellular polyamine levels has been related
to a delay in tumor growth and progression both in cell culture as
well as in animals and humans (33–38). In this report, we
observed a significant delay in tumor growth by CPC-200 (Fig. 5)
although there is an increase, and not a decrease, in cellular
spermidine and putrescine levels and no observable change in
cellular spermine level. Therefore, change in cellular polyamine
levels is probably not a cause for the delay in tumor progression
in the TRAMP  FVB animals developing spontaneous prostate
tumor. The detail study of the polyamine and Ac-polyamine levels

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of SSAT
induction by a hormone (hormone analogue) R1881. Identification
of androgen-induced polyamine catabolism leading to enhanced
oxidative stress in the prostate cells and significant inhibition of
CaP progression by blocking this pathway should open up a new
avenue for CaP chemoprevention.
