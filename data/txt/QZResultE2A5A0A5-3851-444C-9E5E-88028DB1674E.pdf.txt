ABSTRACT
The antidiabetic drug metformin exerts antineoplastic effects in many types of
malignancies, however the effect of metformin on cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) still
remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated that metformin treatment
was closely associated with the clinicopathologic characteristics and improved
postoperative survival of CCA patients. Metformin inhibited CCA tumor growth by
cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. We explored that the expression of six miRNAs
(mir124, 182, 27b, let7b, 221 and 181a), which could directly target cell-cycleregulatory genes, was altered by metformin in vitro and in vivo. These miRNAs were
dysregulated in cholangiocarcinoma and promoted the CCA genesis and metformin
exactly modulated these carcinogenic miRNAs expression to arrest the cell cycle and
inhibit the proliferation. Meanwhile, these miRNAs expression changes correlated
with the tumor volume and postoperative survival of CCA patients and could be used
to predict the prognosis. Further we confirmed that metformin upregulated Drosha to
modulate these miRNAs expression. Our results elucidated that metformin inhibited
CCA tumor growth via the regulation of Drosha-mediated multiple carcinogenic
miRNAs expression and comprehensive evaluation of these miRNAs expression could
be more efficient to predict the prognosis. Moreover, metformin might be a quite
promising strategy for CCA prevention and treatment.

INTRODUCTION

States with less than 30% 5-year survival [4]. Because
of resistance to common chemotherapies, up to now the
radical surgical resection is still the most powerful therapy
for CCA [5].
Metformin is the most widely used antidiabetic
drug in the world, introduced into clinical practice in the
1950s for the treatment of type II diabetes [6], and there is
increasing evidence of the potential efficacy of this agent
as an anticancer drug recently [7, 8]. According to the
epidemiologic survey, metformin has significant effects
on tumorigenesis in metformin treated patients [9, 10]. It
has been reported that patients with type II diabetes who
are prescribed metformin have a lower risk of pancreatic

Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), the second most
common primary hepatobiliary malignancy, is a fatal
cancer originating from the neoplastic transformation of
biliary epithelial cells and characterized by increasing
incidence worldwide and poor prognosis [1]. CCA is most
often diagnosed at an advanced stage with intrahepatic
and lymph node metastases because the early stages of
CCA progression are usually asymptomatic without
effective preventive measures [2, 3]. According to
clinical statistical study, approximately 7500 new cases of
cholangiocarcinoma are diagnosed per year in the United

cancer than those not taking metformin [11]. In addition,
several reports also outlined the decreased cancer
incidence and cancer related mortality in the tumor patients
who received metformin [10]. Further investigations found
that metformin inhibited the proliferation of various
human cancer cell types including prostate, esophageal,
renal and glioma tumor cells [12-15]. Thus, metformin
has been recognized as not only an antidiabetic drug but a
potentially preventive and therapeutic anticancer drug [9,
12, 13, 16].
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small,
noncoding, single-stranded RNAs that negatively regulate
gene expression by mainly binding to 3’ untranslated
region (UTR) of target mRNAs at the posttranscriptional
level [17, 18]. Numerous researches have demonstrated
that aberrant expression of miRNAs are involved in the
development, invasion, metastasis and prognosis of
various cancers [19-22]. According to recent studies [12,
23-25], the expression profiles of miRNAs are altered
by metformin in different tumor cells, indicating that
miRNAs might play an important role in the anticancer
effect of metformin [25, 26].
In this study, we have reported that metformin
had anticancer effect on cholangiocarcinoma through
regulation of Drosha-mediated multiple carcinogenic
miRNAs expression. And compositive assessment of these
miRNAs expression changes could be more efficient to
predict the prognosis for CCA patients and might be the
novel anticancer therapeutic targets.

Metformin
closely
correlated
with
clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis of
CCA patients
A total of 89 CCA patients were studied and the
clinicopathologic characteristics of the patients were
summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The tumor size
and volume of G3 patients were smaller than those of
G2 patients and the postoperative survival of G3 patients
was longer than that of G2 or G1 patients (Fig. 1A). The
representative HE staining of tumor tissues was shown in
Fig. 10. The results showed that metformin treatment was
closely associated with a decrease in the tumor size and
volume of CCA patients, and the improved postoperative
survival.

Metformin inhibited CCA tumor growth in vivo
We evaluated the effect of metformin in vivo in a
xenograft tumor model through metformin injection (2mg/
mouse). Throughout the course of treatment, there were
no visible side effects or changes in body weight of the
mice (Fig. 1C). And metformin was significantly effective
in inhibiting tumor growth in vivo, resulting in decreased
tumor volume and weight (Fig. 1B, 1D). These data

Dysregulation of six miRNAs in CCA genesis

indicated that metformin could also reduce tumor volume
and growth rate of CCA cells in vivo.

The data showed that the six miRNAs were
dysregulated in CCA (Fig. 3C, 3F). Thus we investigated
the effect of these miRNAs on the CCA genesis through
transfecting CCA cells with miRNA mimics and inhibitor.
Upregulation of mir124, 182, 27b and let7b could inhibit
the CCA cells proliferation and arrest the cell cycle in G0/
G1 phase, however, the proliferation and cell cycle were
both promoted through upregulating mir221 or mir181a
expression (Fig. 4A-B). PNCA and P53 were also detected
after transfection (Fig. 4E). The results further confirmed
that these dysregulated miRNAs, including downregulated
mir124, 182, 27b, let7b and upregulated mir221, 181a,
were involved in the CCA genesis and promoted this
process.

Metformin inhibited CCA cells proliferation by
cell cycle arrest
To investigate the effect of metformin on CCA
in vitro, we used four human CCA cell lines including
HCCC-9810, RBE, SSP25 and Hucct1. Metformin
obviously decreased the viability of CCA cells in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 2A) and 20, 40mmol/L metformin
was selected for further study. Metformin also decreased
colony formation of CCA cells in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 2B). As shown in Fig. 2C, the cell cycle of
CCA cells was arrested in G0/G1 phase by metformin
in a dose-dependent manner. The mRNA and protein
expression changes of cell-cycle-regulatory genes after
metformin treatment were shown in Fig. 2D-E. IF assay
showed that the cell count and CDK4 expression both
decreased in metformin treated cells (Fig. 2F). Moreover,
the proliferative marker genes PCNA and P53 were also
detected after metformin treatment (Fig. 2G). The results
illustrated that metformin blocked cell cycle to inhibit
CCA cells proliferation.

Regulating miRNAs could suppress
antiproliferative effect of metformin

Metformin altered the expression of six miRNAs
which could inhibit the CCA cells proliferation,
indicating that the antiproliferative effect of metformin
might be suppressed by regulating miRNAs expression.
Consequently, we treated the CCA cells, which had already
been transfected with miRNA mimics or inhibitor, with
10mmol/L metformin. The data of cell viability assay and
cell cycle analysis showed that the antiproliferation and
cell cycle arrest induced by metformin were reversed (Fig.
4C-D). The results further confirmed that these miRNAs
were involved in the anticancer effect of metformin.

Metformin altered the miRNAs expression
Recent studies reported that the miRNAs expression
was altered by metformin [12, 23-26]. According to
microassay platform analysis [12, 23, 24], the fourteen
miRNAs which were obviously changed after metformin
treatment were detected (Fig. 3A). The results showed that
metformin also altered the miRNAs expression in CCA
cells. Among these fourteen candidates, six miRNAs (hsamir-124-3p, hsa-mir-182-5p, hsa-mir-27b-3p, hsa-mirlet7b-5p, hsa-mir-221-3p and hsa-mir-181a-3p), which
might target cell-cycle-regulatory genes according to
bioinformatic algorithms, were selected for further study.
The six miRNAs expression changes were in a dosedependent manner in CCA cells after metformin treatment
(Fig. 3B). There were obvious expression changes of six
miRNAs in tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal
tissues of CCA patients (Fig. 3C). Figure 3D showed that
the expression changes of mir124, 27b, let7b and 181a
of G3 patients were significantly less than those of G2
patients. In the xenograft tumor tissues, there were obvious
differences of mir124, 182, 27b, let7b and 181a expression
between metformin group and control group (Fig. 3E). The
six miRNAs expression of CCA cells and BEC (biliary
epithelial cell) was shown in Fig. 3F. The results indicated
that metformin could alter these six miRNAs expression
in vitro and in vivo, and lessen these miRNAs expression
changes in human tumor tissues. These six miRNAs might
be involved in the CCA genesis and the anticancer effect
of metformin.

the

The six miRNAs targeted multiple cell-cycleregulatory genes
Next we assessed whether these miRNAs could
target the putative cell-cycle-regulatory genes. We
transfected the CCA cells with miRNA mimics and
inhibitor to detect the mRNA and protein expression
changes of putative target genes (Fig. 5A-B). The results
of luciferase activity assay were shown in Fig. 5C. The
sequence sites of miRNA and binding UTR of target
genes and structure of reporter vectors were shown in Fig.
5D. In summary, the cell-cycle-regulatory genes CDK2,
CDK4, CyclinD1 and CyclinE1 were targeted by mir124,
CDK2 and CyclinD1 were targeted by mir182 and mir27b,
CyclinD1 was targeted by mirlet7b, P27 was targeted by
mir221 and mir181a.

The miRNAs expression correlated with prognosis
of CCA patients
The six miRNAs were found to be involved in the
CCA genesis and the anticancer effect of metformin,

thus we wanted to evaluate whether these miRNAs were
clinically useful for CCA patients. The expression change
of mir182, 27b and let7b was closely associated with
tumor volume of G2 patients (Fig. 6A, R<-0.4). Figure 6B
showed that the expression change of mir124, 27b, let7b
and 181a was also closely associated with postoperative
survival of G2 patients (R≤-0.45 or ≥0.45).
The mean Log10 (mir expression change) was defined as the
cutoff value of each miRNA expression change [27-30]
(Fig. 6C). According to each miRNA expression change
which was greater or less than its cutoff value, the patient
was classified into High or Low mir patient [31-34]. And
G2 patients could be divided into two subgroups, such as
Low mir124 patients and High mir124 patients. Figure 6H
showed that there were significant differences in tumor
volume between Low and High mir patients of mir182,
27b, let7b and 221. The postoperative survival of Low and
High mir patients was listed in Supplementary Table 3 and
there were significant differences of postoperative survival
between Low and High mir patients of mir124, 27b, let7,
221 and 181a (Fig. 6D).
Further we applied mirs-expression score to
combine six miRNAs expression changes together. In
one patient, the expression change of mir124, 182, 27b or
let7b was less than its cutoff value and this single miRNA
expression of the patient scored one; the expression
change of mir221 or 181a was greater than its cutoff value
and this single miRNA expression of the patient also
scored one. According to six miRNAs expression changes,
the mirs-expression score of one single patient might
range from 0 to 6. Figure 6E showed the tumor volume
and postoperative survival of different score patients and
mirs-expression score was closely associated with the
tumor volume and postoperative survival of G2 patients
(Fig. 6G).
The patient with mirs-expression score from 0 to
3 was considered as Low mirs patient and the patient
with mirs-expression score from 4 to 6 was considered
as High mirs patient. Accordingly, G2 patients were
divided into two subgroups including Low mirs patients
(n=44) and High mirs patients (n=25). Based on these
six miRNAs expression changes, we applied hierarchical
clustering analysis to cluster G2 patients. As shown in Fig.
6F, G2 patients were also clustered into two subgroups
which were mostly consistent with the results by using
mirs-expression score. The detailed clinicopathologic
characteristics of Low and High mirs patients were listed
in Supplementary Table 2. Figure 6I showed that the tumor
size and volume of Low mirs patients were less than those
of High mirs patients and there were the most significant
differences of tumor volume and postoperative survival
between Low and High mirs patients. These data showed
that the associations with tumor volume and postoperative
survival were stronger for mirs-expression than for single
miRNA expression, and the differences of tumor volume
and postoperative survival between Low and High mirs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

patients were more significant than those between single
Low and High mir patients. These results suggested that
these miRNAs expression could be used to predict the
prognosis for CCA patients and assessment of multiple
miRNAs expression might be more efficient.

Metformin modulated Drosha to affect miRNAs
expression
To understand how metformin altered the miRNAs
expression, we detected the key enzymes expression
of miRNA biogenesis and Drosha was most obviously
upregulated [35-38] (Fig. 7A-B). Metformin also
upregulated Drosha expression in human and xenograft
tumor tissues (Fig. 7C-D). Drosha expression of CCA
cells and BEC was shown in Fig. 7E. Drosha could
promote the process of pri-miRNA to mature-miRNA and
Figure 7F showed the expression changes of mature and
pri-miRNAs after Drosha siRNA transfection by using
qRT-PCR [35, 39, 40]. The six pri-miRNAs expression
changes, which were opposite to expression changes of
mature-miRNAs, were in a dose-dependent manner after
metformin treatment (Fig. 7G, 3B). Further we found
that downregulated Drosha could lessen the miRNAs
expression changes induced by metformin (Fig. 7H) and
suppress antiproliferative and cell cycle arrest effect of
20mmol/L metformin (Fig. 8E). In human tissues, Drosha
expression change was positively correlated with the
expression changes of mir124, 182, 27b and let7b (Fig.
7I), and negatively associated with mirs-expression score
(Fig. 7J). Drosha expression of Low mirs patients was
higher than that of High mirs patients (Fig. 7K). In brief,
these results indicated that metformin upregulated Drosha,
which could modulate the miRNA biogenesis, to affect
these miRNAs expression. The schematic presentation of
the underlying anticancer mechanism of metformin was
shown in Fig. 7L.

Metformin also upregulated DGCR8 to affect
miRNAs expression
Drosha usually combined DGCR8 to form a
complex to function, thus DGCR8 was also studied.
Metformin upregulated DGCR8 expression both in vitro
and in vivo (Fig. 7A, 8A-B). Downregulated DGCR8
interfered by siRNA could affect the mature and primiRNAs expression and the expression changes of
mature-miRNAs were opposite to those of pri-miRNAs
(Fig. 8D). As with Drosha, downregulated DGCR8 could
also suppress antiproliferative and cell cycle arrest effect
of 20mmol/L metformin (Fig. 8E). These results were
consistent with the research in Drosha and implied that
metformin also upregulated DGCR8 to modulate these
miRNAs expression. The siRNA efficiency of Drosha and
DGCR8 was shown in Fig. 8F.

Dysregulation of Drosha/DGCR8 in CCA genesis

and High Drosha patients had smaller tumor volume
and longer postoperative survival (Fig. 9D-E). These
results indicated that dysregulated Drosha/DGCR8,
which upstream regulated these carcinogenic miRNAs
expression, promoted the CCA genesis and Drosha
expression might be also used to predict the prognosis for
CCA patients.

We found that Drosha was downregulated in the
tumor tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues of
CCA patients (Fig. 7C). Drosha and DGCR8 expression
in CCA cells was relatively less than those in BEC (Fig.
7E, 8C). Using siRNA to knock down Drosha/DGCR8 in
vitro, the proliferation and cell cycle of CCA cells were
both promoted (Fig. 9A). Figure 9B showed the mRNA
and protein expression changes of cell-cycle-regulatory
genes after Drosha/DGCR8 siRNA transfection. Drosha
expression change was negatively associated with tumor
volume and positively correlated with postoperative
survival of G2 patients (Fig. 9C). As with miRNAs, the
mean Log10 (Drosha expression change) was defined as the cutoff
value of Drosha expression change of G2 patients

DISCUSSION
Previous studies have pointed out that metformin
was associated with reduced risk and improved prognosis
of many cancers and had an excellent safety record in
diabetic patients; metformin also inhibited various tumor
cells proliferation both in vitro and in vivo [9-16, 23, 24,
26]. Recent studies showed that metformin altered the

expression profiles of miRNAs in several tumor cells
[12, 23, 24]. These findings suggested that metformin had
potent anticancer effect which miRNAs might be involved
in and might be a promising strategy for cancer prevention
and treatment. In this study, we showed the anticancer
effect of metformin in cholangiocarcinoma and studied the
underlying anticancer mechanism of metformin. We found
that metformin treatment was closely associated with
clinicopathological characteristics of CCA patients and the
improved postoperative survival. Using in vitro and in vivo
assays, we confirmed that metformin arrested cell cycle in
G0/G1 phase to inhibit CCA cells proliferation.
To investigate whether miRNAs were involved
in the anticancer effect of metformin, we identified six
miRNAs which were altered by metformin in vitro and
in vivo, and the targets of these miRNAs were all cellcycle-regulatory genes. It was found that there were
obvious differences of these miRNAs expression in tumor

tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues and the
dysregulation of these miRNAs could promote the cell
cycle and enhance the CCA cells proliferation. According
to researches [20, 21], these miRNAs and their targets
were also dysregulated and promoted the carcinogenesis
in other cancers [34, 41]. The miRNAs expression changes
induced by metformin were opposite to the expression
changes of these dysregulated miRNAs in human
tumor tissues and metformin could lessen dysregulated
expression changes of these miRNAs. And regulating
miRNAs expression could suppress the antiproliferative
and cell cycle arrest effect of metformin. These results
implicated that these dysregulated miRNAs were involved
in the CCA genesis and promoted this process. Metformin
exactly modulated these carcinogenic miRNAs, which
further targeted cell-cycle-regulatory genes to arrest the
cell cycle and inhibit the proliferation, to achieve the
anticancer effect in cholangiocarcinoma.

Another finding of this study was that these
miRNAs expression changes were clinically useful and
could be used to predict the prognosis for CCA patients.
We found that there were various degrees of correlations
between tumor volume, postoperative survival and each
miRNA expression change. Based on the cutoff value of
each miRNA expression change [27-29, 31], G2 patients
were divided into High and Low mir patients, and High
mir patients of mir124, 182, 27b, let7b and Low mir
patients of mir221, 181a had smaller tumor volume and
longer postoperative survival. Meanwhile, we utilized
mirs-expression score to compositely evaluate six
miRNAs expression in one single patient and classified G2
patients into two subgroups including High and Low mirs
patients, which were mostly consistent with the results of
hierarchical clustering analysis. The results proved that the
associations with tumor volume and postoperative survival
were stronger for composite six miRNAs assessment
than for single miRNA evaluation; and the differences of
tumor volume and postoperative survival between High
and Low mirs patients were more significant than those
between single High and Low mir patients. In addition,
Low mirs patients had the smallest tumor volume and the
longest postoperative survival. These data illustrated that
to evaluate multiple miRNAs expression might be more
efficacious for assessing the prognosis of CCA patients.

To understand how metformin affected the miRNAs
expression, we detected the key enzymes expression of
miRNA biogenesis in metformin treated CCA cells and
Drosha had the most obviously increased expression
[35-38]. Metformin also increased Drosha expression in
human and xenograft tumor tissues. The increased Drosha
expression induced by metformin was similar to the
major of six miRNAs expression changes after metformin
treatment in vitro and in vivo. The miRNAs expression
changes induced by regulating Drosha were consistent
with the miRNAs expression changes after metformin
treatment, and downregulating Drosha could lessen the
miRNAs expression changes induced by metformin.
Compared with regulating single miRNA, downregulated
Drosha could suppress antiproliferative and cell cycle
arrest effect of relative high concentration metformin. We
also verified the pri-miRNAs expression changes after
metformin treatment and Drosha siRNA transfection and
analyzed the correlations between Drosha expression
and miRNAs expression in human tissues. However, it
was found that Drosha did not modulate these miRNAs
expression directly and the expression changes of mir221
and 181a might be due to unbalanced miRNA biogenesis
which was affected by increased Drosha [42]. Drosha
usually combined with DGCR8 to function and thus
DGCR8 was also studied [35, 38, 43]. Taken together, the

results indicated that metformin affected these miRNAs
expression through upregulating Drosha which upstream
modulated the miRNAs biogenesis directly or indirectly.
In summary, our data presented in this study
provided evidence elucidating that metformin, a widely
used antidiabetic drug, could inhibit CCA tumor
growth and improve the prognosis of CCA patients.
The underlying anticancer mechanism of metformin
depended on the regulation of Drosha-mediated multiple
carcinogenic miRNAs which could directly target cellcycle-regulatory genes to arrest the cell cycle and inhibit
the proliferation. We also discovered that compositive
assessment of multiple miRNAs expression could be
more efficient to predict the prognosis for CCA patients
and might be the potential therapeutic targets for CCA
prevention and treatment. Further work should be
performed to get more understanding about anticancer
mechanisms of metformin, and to explore the clinical use
of metformin for cancer therapy.

Cell lines and culture
HCCC-9810, RBE and SSP25 were purchased from
the Type Culture Collection of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences (Shanghai, China); Hucct1, 293T and human
biliary epithelial cell (BEC) were preserved in our
laboratory. Cells were grown in DMEM or RPMI-1640
supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin
(100 U/mL/50mg/mL) at 37°C and 5% CO2. The cells had
been passed for less than six months in culture when the
experiments were carried out.

Target genes prediction of miRNAs
The microRNA target bioinformatics software
microRNA.org was used to predict the target genes of
miRNAs. The miRNAs and putative targeted cell-cycleregulatory genes were listed in Supplementary Table 5.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNA extraction and qRT-PCR

Patients and tissue samples

Total RNA was extracted by using TRIzol reagent.
Reverse transcription reactions were carried out using
M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and qRTPCR (quantificational real-time PCR) was performed on
Applied Biosystem as described previously [44, 45]. The
relative expression levels of miRNAs and mRNAs were
calculated and quantified using the 2-ΔΔCt method after
normalization for the expression of control, human U6
snRNA and β-actin served as endogenous controls. The
primers used in qRT-PCR were listed in Supplementary
Table 6.

A total of 89 CCA specimens were obtained from the
Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University
from 2006 to 2011. All the patients were diagnosed
with extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and confirmed
pathologically, and received the tumor resection. None of
the patients had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy
preoperatively or postoperatively. All the patients
received the same medical care and follow up. Samples
were collected according to the approval of the ethical
committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin
Medical University, with written individual consent from
each patient for this study. The total 89 CCA patients
were defined as Group One (G1) patients. Among these
89 patients, 69 patients without diabetes and metformin
treatment were defined as Group Two (G2) patients and
20 patients who received metformin treatment before
the surgery because of type II diabetes were defined as
Group Three (G3) patients. The detailed clinicopathologic
characteristics of the CCA patients in this study were listed
in Supplementary Table 1.

Cell viability, colony formation assay and western
blot
Cell viability and colony formation assay were
carried out as previously described [46]. Total protein was
extracted using RIPA buffer and protein expression was
analyzed by western blot as described previously [46].
β-actin served as an endogenous control.

Reagents and antibodies

Flow cytometric analysis

Metformin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
DMEM, RPMI-1640, Lipofectamine 2000, TRIzol,
penicillin/streptomycin, trypsin and fetal bovine serum
(FBS) were from Invitrogen. MicroRNAs mimics
and inhibitor, and siRNA against Drosha and DGCR8
were purchased from GenePharma (Shanghai, China).
The antibodies used in western blot were listed in

Cells were harvested, fixed in 80% ethanol and
stored at 4°C. On the day of analysis, cells were washed
and centrifuged using cold PBS, suspended in 10ml
PBS and 1ml RnaseA solution (250mg/ml) followed by
incubation for 30 minutes at 37°C. Then, 100μl propidium
iodide stain (100mg/ml) was added to each tube, which
was then incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes prior to analysis.

length×(width)2×0.5.

Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis

Statistical analysis was performed with the SPSS
16.0 software. Values were expressed as mean±SD
using the Student’s t-test. The postoperative survival
was compared with the Kaplan-Meier method and the
significance was determined by the log-rank test. The
correlation analysis was examined using spearman
rank correlation test. The P<0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.

Statistical analysis

Cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 minutes at room temperature
followed by permeabilisation with 0.1% sodium citrate
plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The cells were subjected to
immunofluorescent staining with CDK4 antibody (1:200,
CST #12790) for 16 hours at 4°C. Cells were then washed
with cold PBS three times for five minutes each and
incubated with fluorescence labeled secondary antibody
(1:400, #ZF0511, ZSGB-BIO) for 30 minutes. The cells
were visualized using inverted fluorescence microscope
(FSX100, Olympus).

Conflicts of Interest

Luciferase activity assay

The authors confirm that there are no conflicts of
interest.

The putative binding site of target genes 3’-UTR
sequences, the downstream of which contained the firefly
luciferase gene, were cloned and inserted into the SpeI
and HindIII site of pMIR-REPORT luciferase vector
(Ambion). The pMIR-target genes-3’ UTR mutants that
deleted the putative binding site were also generated.
The primers for luciferase report vectors were listed in
Supplementary Table 7. The WT or MUT pMIR-REPORT
luciferase vector was transfected into 293T cells with
miRNA mimics and pRL-TK vector (Promega) was used
for normalization of transfection efficiency. The firefly
luciferase activity was measured as described previously
[46].

Subcutaneous CCA experiments
Female nude mice (5-6 weeks old) were purchased
from Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal, Inc. (Beijing,
China). All animal experiments were done according
to the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committeeapproved protocol. Institutional guidelines for the proper
and humane use of animals in research were followed.
The mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free
environment. 5×106 Hucct1 cells suspended in PBS
were inoculated subcutaneously in the flanks. Metformin
treatment was started 7 days after inoculation of the cells.
The experimental group (n=8) was treated daily with
i.p. injection of metformin (2mg/mouse, administered in
PBS) for four weeks, whereas the control group (n=8)
received equal volume of PBS only. Throughout the
course of treatment, the mice were monitored daily and
weighed every third day to check for physical condition.
The tumor volume was calculated using the formula:
