BACKGROUND: Increased susceptibility to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)/capecitabine can lead to rapidly occurring toxicity caused by impaired clearance, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, and other genetic variations in the enzymes that metabolize 5-FU.
Life-threatening 5-FU overdoses occur because of infusion pump errors, dosage miscalculations, and accidental or suicidal ingestion
of capecitabine. Uridine triacetate (Vistogard) was approved in 2015 for adult and pediatric patients who exhibit early-onset severe
or life-threatening 5-FU/capecitabine toxicities or present with an overdose. Uridine triacetate delivers high concentrations of uridine,
which competes with toxic 5-FU metabolites. METHODS: In 2 open-label clinical studies, patients who presented with a 5-FU/capecitabine overdose or an early onset of severe toxicities were treated. Patients received uridine triacetate as soon as possible (most
within the first 96 hours after 5-FU/capecitabine). Outcomes included survival, resumption of chemotherapy, and safety. Their survival
was compared with the survival of a historical cohort of overdose patients who received only supportive care. RESULTS: A total of
137 of 142 overdose patients (96%) treated with uridine triacetate survived and had a rapid reversal of severe acute cardiotoxicity
and neurotoxicity; in addition, mucositis and leukopenia were prevented, or the patients recovered from them. In the historical cohort,
21 of 25 patients (84%) died. Among the 141 uridine triacetate–treated overdose patients with a diagnosis of cancer (the noncancer
patients included 6 intentional or accidental pediatric overdoses), 53 resumed chemotherapy in < 30 days (median time after 5-FU,
19.6 days), and this indicated a rapid recovery from toxicity. Adverse reactions in patients receiving uridine triacetate included vomiting (8.1%), nausea (4.6%), and diarrhea (3.5%). CONCLUSIONS: In these studies, uridine triacetate was a safe and effective lifesaving

antidote for capecitabine and 5-FU overexposure, and it facilitated the rapid resumption of chemotherapy. Cancer 2017;123:345-56. V

INTRODUCTION
In 2007, the Institute for Safe Medication Practices (ISMP) released an alert that described a fatal 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) overdose, an error caused by a misprogrammed chemotherapy pump that resulted in an avoidable death. In this instance, a 43year-old patient received a 5250-mg dose of 5-FU over 4 hours instead of the intended 4 days and died 22 days later from
toxicity1 even after aggressive supportive care. Accidental overdoses with 5-FU continue to be a significant problem.2-5
Capecitabine is an orally bioavailable prodrug that is converted by 3 sequential enzymatic steps to yield 5-FU.6 The
most common toxicities caused by both agents are consequences of cytotoxic damage to rapidly dividing cells, and they include mucositis, diarrhea, and cytopenias. Cutaneous toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome are more common with capecitabine than 5-FU. Toxicities are generally cumulative over repeated treatment cycles. Capecitabine overdoses have
occurred in suicide attempts and in young children accidentally ingesting a relative’s tablets. Genetic enzyme variants,
resulting in either enhanced conversion of capecitabine to 5-FU or increased sensitivity to 5-FU toxicity, can result in lifethreatening and fatal toxicities from planned dosages of capecitabine or 5-FU.6-11

Figure 1. 5-FU (see structure) is converted into 3 main active
metabolites: FdUMP, FdUTP, and FUTP. The main mechanism of
5-FU activation is conversion to FUMP; this occurs either directly
by OPRT with PRPP as the cofactor or indirectly via FUR through
the sequential action of UP and UK. FUMP is then phosphorylated to FUDP, which can be either further phosphorylated to the
active metabolite FUTP or converted to FdUDP by RR. In turn,
FdUDP can be either phosphorylated or dephosphorylated to
generate the active metabolites FdUTP and FdUMP, respectively. An alternative activation pathway involves the TP-catalyzed
conversion of 5-FU to FUDR, which is then phosphorylated by
TK to FdUMP. The DPD-mediated conversion of 5-FU to DHFU is
the rate-limiting step of 5-FU catabolism in normal and tumor
cells. Up to 80% of administered 5-FU is broken down by DPD in
the liver.56 Abbreviations: DHFU, dihydrofluorouracil; DPD, dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase; FdUDP, fluorodeoxyuridine diphosphate; FdUMP, fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate; FdUTP,

The natural history of early-onset severe toxicity
from 5-FU and capecitabine is well documented.6,12-21
Patients with an exaggerated sensitivity to 5-FU or capecitabine may quickly develop severe, life-threatening toxicities during or after administration, which can manifest as
346

severe forms of common toxicities such as mucositis and
cytopenias but can also include central neurotoxicity and
acute cardiomyopathy. Early-onset severe toxicities can
occur during or after a patient’s first course of capecitabine or 5-FU treatment, and the virulence can rival or exceed cases of massive overdose. These early-onset patients
are more susceptible to toxicities due to the pharmacogenetics of 5-FU metabolism, including variations in
dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD),17,22-24 thymidylate synthase (TYMS),23,25 and orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT),6,17,23 or due to renal impairment or
other less well-defined causes.6
It has been demonstrated clinically and in animals
that uridine, through a simple mechanism of action, prevents or reduces 5-FU–related mortality and toxicity to
the gastrointestinal tract and hematopoietic system.26-32
Exogenous uridine, when it is administered after 5-FU,
competes with the toxic 5-FU metabolite fluorouridine
triphosphate (FUTP) for incorporation into RNA in normal tissues (Fig. 1).26,29-33 Preclinical and clinical studies
have shown that a sustained uridine concentration of
70 lmol/L provides protection of normal tissues from the
toxic effects of FUTP.26-35 However, the oral administration of adequate doses of uridine is not clinically feasible
because of poor bioavailability, and parenteral infusion
presents safety issues, including phlebitis and fever.27,30-35
Uridine triacetate (Vistogard; Wellstat Therapeutics
Corporation, Gaithersburg, MD) is an oral pyrimidine analogue of uridine. Uridine triacetate is lipophilic, is quickly
absorbed in the gut, and is rapidly deacetylated in the circulation to yield free uridine.34,37-41 It provides 4- to 6fold more bioavailable uridine than equimolar doses of uridine itself.34,37-41 The administration of uridine triacetate
to mice, in models of either lethal 5-FU overdosing or
clearance defects, significantly improved survival, especially
when it was administered within the first 24 hours after 5FU. Later administration provided a diminishing but still
significant benefit.37,41 The effectiveness of uridine triacetate as an antidote to 5-FU has been studied previously3741
in animals37,40 and in clinical trials of intentional 5-FU
dose escalation.41 This report presents the final overall safety and efficacy of uridine triacetate in 2 compassionate-use,
open-label clinical studies conducted in the United States
and outside the United States, including Europe, Canada,
and Australia, by Wellstat Therapeutics Corporation in
adult and pediatric patients overdosed with 5-FU or capecitabine or presenting with an early onset of severe toxicity.38,39 The primary efficacy endpoint was patient survival

administration of a planned dose of 5-FU or capecitabine.
The standard treatment for a 5-FU overdose before uridine
triacetate was supportive care, including antiemetics, intravenous fluids, antibiotics, intensive care, and medications
to treat myelosuppression. Therefore, in this report, the
overall efficacy of treatment with uridine triacetate is compared with a historical cohort of cases in which documented overdose patients received best supportive care.
The resumption of chemotherapy treatment within the 30day posttreatment period was also examined. Vistogard
was approved by the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) in December 2015.42
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In both clinical trials, uridine triacetate was provided to
patients because of a 5-FU or capecitabine overdose and/
or a rapid early onset of serious toxicity within the first 96
hours after the administration of planned doses of 5-FU
or capecitabine. Because there were no existing antidotal
treatments for 5-FU toxicity and the use of a placebo
would have been unethical, a historical control cohort of
patients who overdosed on 5-FU and received only best
supportive care was sourced from all available literature
and used as a comparator.
Key inclusion criteria included consenting patients
who were determined to be at excess risk for 5-FU toxicity
due to a frank overdose (the administration of 5-FU at a
dose or infusion rate greater than the intended dose or
maximum tolerated dose for the patient’s intended regimen) or who demonstrated a rapid onset of severe toxicity
or were known or suspected to have increased susceptibility to 5-FU (eg, a patient known to be DPD-deficient).
Early-onset severe toxicities manifested during or within
the 96 hours after the administration of 5-FU or during a
standard 14-day course of capecitabine (days 3-9) and included severe cytotoxic mucosal and/or hematologic toxicities as well as acute encephalopathy and/or
cardiomyopathy. Most early-onset toxicities in this study
occurred after a patient’s first exposure to 5-FU or capecitabine, and this indicated an unusual susceptibility to the
toxicity of these chemotherapy drugs.
Patients began emergency treatment with uridine
triacetate (10 g orally every 6 hours for a total of 20 doses)
as soon as possible after 5-FU or capecitabine and the recognition of the need for antidotal treatment. The regimen
was based on previous pharmacokinetic and clinical studies of uridine triacetate; data from these studies established
that the proposed adult dose (fixed at 10 g) and pediatric
dose (6.2 g/m2 of body surface area up to a maximum of
10 g) given every 6 hours for a total of 20 doses for 5 days

would provide steady-state plasma uridine concentrations
of at least 70 lM, the threshold for protecting normal tissues from the toxic effects of 5-FU.29-32 This concentration was maintained for 5 days to ensure the clearance of
5-FU metabolites from tissues and thus the optimum inhibition of the course of 5-FU toxicities.25-29,38-41
Collected data included overdose details (dose,
cause, infusion start and stop times, and symptoms associated with the overdose), the early onset of toxicities after
5-FU (or capecitabine), or known or suspected impaired
clearance and outcomes. Each patient’s course and outcome, including survival, were assessed for 30 days after
the initial event. Investigators supplied deidentified medical records, dosing logs, and toxicity and adverse event
data to the sponsor, and independent study coordinators
completed all case report forms with the investigatorsupplied documentation.
The overall primary endpoint was survival or the resumption of chemotherapy during the 30-day monitoring
period; all patients who resumed chemotherapy also survived beyond the 30-day monitoring period. The primary
safety endpoint was the monitoring of adverse events with
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03) within the same 30-day period. Adverse events
known to be associated with 5-FU, other chemotherapeutic agents administered together with 5-FU, other anticancer treatments received, and the patient’s underlying
diagnosis and medical history were documented.
All patients (or their legal representatives) provided
informed consent before the initiation of any studyrelated procedure. Uridine triacetate was provided by
Wellstat Therapeutics Corporation after a review of eligibility upon a physician’s request for the antidote under
emergency single-patient investigational new drug regulations (or the equivalent outside the United States) or to
those meeting eligibility criteria for the expanded access
protocol. Both protocols were approved by a central institutional review board, and any use of uridine triacetate
was subject to institutional review board (or ethics committee) notification at the site. This study was approved
and conducted in compliance with good clinical practice
and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01432301).
No comparative analyses or inferential statistics were
performed.
Historical Case Cohort

In lieu of an active or placebo control, to permit a comparison of active treatment with uridine triacetate and best
supportive care, case records of patients who experienced
5-FU overdoses were obtained from a review of the

1 death was attributed to septic shock associated with acute ischemic enteritis and ileus, gram-negative bacteremia, and respiratory failure; and 1 death was due to apparent tumor lysis syndrome. bIn all these patients, uridine triacetate was started more
than 96 hours after 5-fluorouracil or capecitabine was stopped. These deaths were attributed to sequelae of 5-fluorouracil toxicities: acute respiratory distress syndrome (n 5 1), multisystem organ failure secondary to sepsis (n 5 1), and septic shock (n 5 3).

available literature, published medicolegal cases, the
FDA’s Manufacturers and User Facility Device Experience database (MAUDE), the FDA’s Adverse Event Databases (FDAble), the FDA’s Medical Product Safety
Network (MedSun), and reports from the ISMP. This
search yielded 47 cases. Key data points sought from this
review included the total 5-FU dose administered, the
time and rate of administration, and the patient outcomes; 25 of the 47 cases included all 3 data elements.
Acute 5-FU toxicity is proportional to the plasma 5FU exposure, which is a function of both the dose and the
infusion rate. To provide a graphical method of comparison of the current uridine triacetate–treated cases (this
study) and the historical cohort (best supportive care) and
to allow the comparison of levels of toxicity of disparate 5FU doses/infusion rates in the historical cohort, a severity
score was calculated for each uridine triacetate study case
and for the 25 cases of 5-FU overdose from the historical
cohort as follows:
Square root of ([Log10 Dose]2 1 [Log10 Infusion
2
Rate]
348

The units were total milligrams delivered (combined
bolus and infusion) for the dose and milligrams per hour
for the infusion rate. Severity scores were assigned to the
historical cohort cases on the basis of the overdose dose
and/or rate and were correlated with the outcomes of cases
in the historical cohort. The same severity score calculation was then used for each of the cases in the study cohort
to provide a method for comparing the historical cohort
and the study cases. Historical cases with severity scores of
4.0 to 4.5 had high probabilities of severe, life-threatening
toxicities; severity scores > 4.5 indicated a high probability of death. Severity scores for maximum tolerated dosages
of 5-FU in a variety of standard regimens are below 4.0
and, in the graphical representation, delineate the boundary of the expected tolerated zone.

median number of doses taken per subject was 20 of 20
(range, 1-23). Overall, more patients were male, and the
mean patient age was 58.1 years. Overall demographics,
including causes of overdoses, are listed in Table 1. The
most common causes of overdoses were infusion pump
programming errors and dose miscalculations. There were
a total of 6 pediatric cases, including 1 patient with autoimmune disease who received 5-FU instead of cyclophosphamide, 3 patients aged 1 to 2 years who accidentally
ingested a family member’s capecitabine, and 2 pediatric
cancer patients who received a 5-FU overdose. There were
a total of 6 adult capecitabine suicide attempts with doses
ranging from 7000 to 28,000 mg ingested at once. All pediatric and intentional-overdose patients were treated
with uridine triacetate. Fourteen patients were treated
with uridine triacetate via a nasogastric or gastrostomy
tube (1 via an orogastric tube) because they had severe
mucositis, were unable to swallow, and/or were comatose
or intubated.
A tabulation of case characteristics for the historical
case cohort is provided in Table 2.

Three of the 8 early-onset patients (38%) who initiated uridine triacetate beyond 96 hours survived. The
5 deaths occurred in early-onset patients who started
uridine triacetate beyond 96 hours. These deaths were
attributed to sequelae of 5-FU toxicities: acute respiratory
distress syndrome (n 5 1), multisystem organ failure secondary to sepsis (n 5 1), and septic shock (n 5 3).
Outcomes: Overdose Patients

All overdose patients (n 5 147) received 1.9 to 576 times
the planned infusion rate of 5-FU or doses up to 10 times
higher than intended. Of the 147 patients who received
uridine triacetate, 5 were lost to follow-up, leaving 142
evaluable patients in the 30 day survival evaluation. A total of 137 of these patients (96%) survived; in comparison, only 4 of the 25 historical (supportive-care) controls
(16%) survived. To aid in comparing the study patients
with the historical control patients, a nomogram showing
survival as a function of overdose severity is shown in Figure 3. Survival data for the study patients treated with uridine triacetate were plotted as a function of severity scores
and are shown in Figure 4.

Outcomes: Early-Onset Patients

Resumption of chemotherapy

Treatment was initiated within 96 hours for 18 of the 26
patients with early-onset severe toxicity (the early-onset
group). Notably, all surviving early-onset patients started
uridine triacetate within the protocol-specified 96 hours
after the termination of 5-FU or capecitabine (Fig. 2).

Of the 147 patients who received uridine triacetate, 6
were accidental or intentional overdoses. Fifty-three of the
141 evaluable overdose patients (38%) treated with uridine triacetate resumed chemotherapy within the 30-day
observation period; the majority of these patients resumed

Patients 19 to 25 were supposed to have received a 5-day continuous infusion of 1000 mg/m2/d but instead were given 5 daily bolus doses of 1000 mg/kg/d.

treatment in less than 3 weeks (mean time to resumption
of chemotherapy, 19.6 days). All of these patients also survived beyond the 30-day monitoring period.
Safety

The adverse reactions reported at a frequency  2% were
vomiting (n 5 14 or 8.1%), nausea (n 5 8 or 4.6%) and
diarrhea (n 5 6 or 3.5%). One head and neck cancer patient with a history of serious nausea and vomiting experienced grade 3 nausea and vomiting while receiving
uridine triacetate. These events are also consistent with
those observed generally in cancer patients receiving
chemotherapy.
DISCUSSION
Overdoses due to a variety of clinical mishaps, most often
the excessively rapid administration of 5-FU, can lead to
excessive 5-FU exposures.3 The frequency of overdoses is
unknown, but with at least 275,000 patients in the United
States receiving multiple cycles of 5-FU annually (most
adjusted for a patient’s body surface area), a substantial
number of unreported overdoses probably occur.44
Severe toxicity generally develops faster in predisposed patients than patients who receive overdoses.7,8,22-24
350

The best elucidated predisposing genetic factor is a DPD
deficiency (3%-5% of 5-FU patients).9,10 The National
Institutes of Health has estimated the number of deaths
due to a DPD deficiency to be approximately 1300
patients per year (0.5% of 5-FU patients).2,44 Approximately 80% of a standard dose of 5-FU is degraded by
DPD, with toxic overexposure occurring if DPD activity is
depressed. An overdose alone can saturate the capacity of
DPD to degrade 5-FU. Mutations in OPRT can increase
5-FU anabolism to form toxic intracellular 5-fluorouridine
nucleotides and are associated with an allele (Gly213Ala)
that has an incidence of 16% to 17% in the United
States,9 with homozygotes (2.5% of the US population) at
high risk for a rapid onset of serious toxicities.9 Particular
polymorphisms in the genes encoding TYMS and methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase are also associated with increased 5-FU toxicity.10,11,17,23,45-48 Life-threatening
capecitabine toxicity can be caused by the same gene variants that exacerbate 5-FU toxicity6 and also by overactivity
of cytidine deaminase, which mediates the conversion of
capecitabine to 5-FU.17 In all of these forms of genetic susceptibility to 5-FU, the proximal cause of death or lifethreatening toxicity is tissue damage caused by 5-FU
metabolites; this tissue damage is often ulcerative mucositis

Figure 3. Historical case outcomes as a function of the 5-fluorouracil infusion rate and dose. The expected tolerated zone is defined by the maximum tolerated doses of a variety of 5-fluorouracil regimens. Patients in the expected lethal zone would be
expected to die on the basis of the infusion rate and dose; patients in the expected tolerated zone as well as those in the
expected serious toxicity zone would be expected to survive. Patients 19 to 25 in Table 2 were supposed to have received a 5day continuous infusion of 1000 mg/m2/d but instead were given 5 daily bolus doses of 1000 mg/kg/d. These patients are not included in the nomogram in this figure because the nomogram is based on a single infusion or bolus/infusion in order to compare
the relative severity of the most common overdose situations.

with neutropenia leading to sepsis, shock, and organ failure. Genetic testing for a DPD deficiency before the initiation of 5-FU or capecitabine chemotherapy has not been
widely adopted, perhaps because of low penetrance, and it
does not detect other consequential mutations (or the low
expression of genetically normal DPD) that may cause serious toxicity after planned dosages of 5-FU. DPD mutations are found in 50% or fewer of severe 5-FU toxicity
cases.17 Other major risk factors for excess fluoropyrimidine toxicity include mutations in OPRT and TYMS,
compromised renal function, older age, elevated pretreatment uracil levels, and increased body surface area.6
Rare but potentially catastrophic side effects of 5FU include acute central neurotoxicity and cardiotoxicity,
which occur in patients with no identifiable predisposing
factors.49-51 In this study, 10 patients presented with serious central neurotoxicity, and 2 presented with acute, lifethreatening cardiotoxicity. Potential mediators of these
toxicities may be 5-FU catabolites such as fluoroacetate.
Central neurologic toxicities related to 5-FU and capecitaCancer

bine treatment can range from confusion and altered
mental status to encephalopathy and coma. Reported cardiotoxic effects include arrhythmias, transient vasospasm,
takotsubo syndrome, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, and
cardiac arrest49-51; these neurologic and cardiac toxicities
can rapidly become fatal.
The absence of a comparator antidote and obvious
ethical prohibitions against a placebo control in the study
made direct quantitative efficacy comparisons difficult.
The use of severity scores allowed a comparison of overdoses and outcomes between cases in the historic cohort and
the clinical study cases. Although there was a possible selection bias introduced by the overdose cases that were
publicly available (perhaps these reported cases were more
severe), the natural history of a severe 5-FU overdose typically ends with death, especially when the dosage exceeds
that planned by 3-fold or more. A countervailing bias is
based on medical liability issues that can keep these cases
from being publicly disseminated. During the review of
the new drug application for uridine triacetate, members

of the FDA staff performed their own analysis of fluorouracil toxicity cases from the FDA’s Adverse Event
Reporting System. The Adverse Event Reporting System
was searched for voluntary postmarketing reports of fatalities in patients who experienced early-onset severe or lifethreatening toxicity after capecitabine or 5-FU. Fiftyeight cases for 5-FU and 145 cases for capecitabine were
uncovered, and many of the cases had a spectrum of signs
and symptoms consistent with our description of earlyonset severe or life-threatening toxicity associated with 5FU or capecitabine. All cases were treated with supportive
care and had uniformly fatal outcomes.52 This case analysis further bolsters the poor survival data observed for the
historical case patients who received only supportive care.
In the historical case cohort, 16% of the patients
who overdosed with 5-FU (and did not receive uridine triacetate) survived. In contrast, 96% of similar patients who
received uridine triacetate survived. A large fraction of the
patients treated with uridine triacetate had received 5-FU
overdoses at least comparable in severity to overdoses that
were uniformly lethal in the historical group (Figs. 3 and
4). Importantly, the timing of the administration of uri352

dine triacetate proved to be a significant survival factor.
Patients who received uridine triacetate within the first 96
hours after the end of 5-FU or capecitabine had increased
survival. All 18 of the early-onset patients (100%) who
were started on uridine triacetate treatment within the 96
hours after the termination of 5-FU or capecitabine survived and recovered; 5 of the 8 patients who initiated
treatment beyond 96 hours died. This illustrates both the
potential severity of early-onset toxicities and the need for
prompt recognition and treatment.
Although direct statistical comparisons (beyond survival) of patients treated with uridine triacetate and
patients treated with best supportive care are difficult, individual case descriptions and comparisons further illustrate the agent’s efficacy. In one case that parallels the
aforementioned 43-year-old patient who died from a 5FU overdose (see the introduction),1 this study included a
43-year-old female patient who received an overdose of 5FU of a very similar magnitude (5000 mg over 0.17 hours
instead of the intended 96 hours). Unlike the patient in
the ISMP report, this patient received uridine triacetate
8 hours after the overdose, and she survived after

experiencing only grade 1 and 2 anemia and thrombocytopenia. She was discharged from the hospital 6 days after
the overdose. In a separate case, a 46-year-old male patient, subsequently discovered to be severely DPDdeficient, received an intended low 5-FU dose of 1710 mg
over 96 hours but experienced grade 4 mucositis, pancytopenia, and hand-foot syndrome as well as grade 3 fever
and diarrhea, but he survived a 15-day hospital stay after
receiving intensive supportive care. Months later, the
same patient was overdosed with a 1-minute bolus of
1000 mg of 5-FU instead of the intended 100 mg dose of
5-FU. He began treatment with uridine triacetate 8 hours
after the overdose and experienced only mild (grade 1/2)
cytopenia that was present before the 5-FU administration, and he did not require a change in his daily routines.
These individual cases illustrate well the profound therapeutic benefit of the early administration of uridine
triacetate.
All patients treated with uridine triacetate after suicidal overdoses of capecitabine (acute ingestion of up to
28,000 mg) survived with minimal toxicities, as did young
children who accidentally ingested a relative’s capecitabine tablets. All of these patients received uridine triacetate within the first 96 hours after the ingestion of
capecitabine.
Recovery from severe 5-FU and capecitabine toxicity
generally causes a delay in subsequent treatment, and this
affects the patient’s cancer therapy.17,53 In these clinical
studies, a significant proportion (38%) of overdose
patients treated with uridine triacetate resumed chemotherapy within the 30-day observation period; most did so
in less than 3 weeks.
Generally, early-onset patients presented with severe
toxicity within hours or several days of the termination of
5-FU or capecitabine; many did so after or during their
very first cycle. In contrast, standard 5-FU toxicities typically develop over a period of weeks and multiple cycles.
Accordingly, many overdose patients did not show immediate signs and symptoms upon the recognition of their
overdose, and they began treatment with uridine triacetate
emergently before symptoms appeared. The incidence of
grade 3 or 4 mucositis was extremely low in overdose
patients, and it was resolved completely in almost all
patients (overdose and early-onset patients) within the 30day observation period. This course parallels published
clinical experience with intentional 5-FU dose escalation
enabled by planned posttreatment uridine triacetate, in
which low frequencies of serious hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, including mucositis, were
noted.10,37,54

Uridine triacetate competitively inhibits components of cytotoxicity attributable to 5-FU incorporation
into RNA; it does not interfere with thymidylate synthase
(TS) inhibition, which is established quickly and irreversibly.55 Uridine triacetate acts by augmenting intracellular
uridine triphosphate to compete with FUTP, a toxic
RNA precursor. Uridine catabolites derived from uridine
triacetate, including uracil and its breakdown products,
also dilute and compete with some 5-FU byproducts such
as fluoroacetate that have been implicated in neurotoxicity
and cardiotoxicity. RNA-directed cytotoxicities account
for a major proportion of dose-limiting and lifethreatening 5-FU toxicities after either an overdose or early onset (whether due to pharmacogenetic susceptibility,
impaired clearance, or other underlying causes).
Treatment-emergent adverse events were consistent
with the setting of a 5-FU or capecitabine overdose. Of
the 10 deaths that occurred among the 173 patients in
these studies, 5 were among patients who received the antidote more than 96 hours after 5-FU or capecitabine; this
agrees with a time window of approximately 96 hours for
effective treatment, as found in preclinical studies.37,40
Three deaths among overdose patients during the 30-day
monitoring period were attributed to progression of the
underlying cancer; 1 was attributed to septic shock associated with acute ischemic enteritis and ileus, gram-negative
bacteremia, and respiratory failure; and 1 was due to apparent tumor lysis syndrome.
Uridine triacetate had a high rate of treatment compliance. Most patients who took uridine triacetate started
treatment in the hospital, but because it is an oral agent
with general ease of use and administration, some of these
patients were able to complete their therapy at home.
Some patients who were unable to swallow or were unconscious when treatment with uridine triacetate began received the medication via nasogastric or gastrostomy
tubes; the administration of uridine triacetate in this manner did not appear to affect its efficacy or safety in comparison with oral ingestion.
In this patient set, attempts to assign causality for
toxicity in specific patients resulted in the identification of
mutations in enzymes involved in 5-FU clearance (DPD),
anabolism (OPRT), or the conversion of capecitabine to
5-FU (cytidine deaminase), but often an associated defect
was not identified. The recognition of early-onset severe
5-FU or capecitabine toxicity is complicated by a lack of
diagnostic tools beyond the observation of signs and
symptoms contrasting with the expected degrees and types
of toxicities for individual patients. A grade 3/4 toxicity is
reported for approximately 30% of patients treated with
353

systemic 5-FU (much of it is cumulative, but in some
cases it develops rapidly during and after a patient’s first
dose), and toxic death is reported for >0.5% of patients.56
A recent publication by Mazzuca et al57 described a technique for measuring the 5-FU degradation (or anabolism)
rate in peripheral mononuclear blood cells. This technique potentially allows better identification of patients at
increased risk for early-onset severe toxicity in comparison
with an assessment of the DPD mutation status. According to this method, there is a high risk of serious toxicity
in patients with either ultrahigh 5-FU metabolism (excessive anabolism) or poor 5-FU metabolism (impaired degradation), and on the basis of the data, the method
indicates that up to 10% of the population overall is at
high risk for developing severe toxicity.57 In the current
report, the number of patients with an overdose exceeded
the number of patients with an early-onset severe toxicity,
in part because the identification of overdose cases is
straightforward. If we assume that the overall incidence
for the risk of developing severe toxicity is >10%,9 it is
not unrealistic to conclude that the frequency of earlyonset patients in reality is probably much higher than the
frequency of patients with an overdose. This reinforces
the need for physicians, nurses, and patients to remain
vigilant for signs and symptoms of early-onset severe toxicity, especially during the initial course or courses of 5FU and capecitabine, and to be prepared to treat it urgently. The identification of a specific genetic cause for already
severe toxicities of 5-FU or capecitabine is not a prerequisite or even recommended before the initiation of antidotal treatment with uridine triacetate because its mode of
action (dilution of and competition with toxic 5-FU
metabolites) applies, regardless of the specific details underlying the exaggerated toxicity. An early onset of serious
symptoms, especially during or after the first cycle of
treatment, often leads to rapid worsening of toxicities or a
fatal outcome that may occur before the identification of
an underlying molecular or metabolic defect is possible.
The safety of uridine triacetate has been established.
No safety issues were observed in any preclinical studies,
and the adverse events experienced by patients in the current study were common in patients undergoing chemotherapy, especially after overexposure to toxic agents. The
adverse reactions at least possibly related to oral uridine
triacetate were almost entirely mild to moderate gastrointestinal events. Those experienced by  2% of patients
were vomiting (8.1%), nausea (4.6%) and diarrhea
(3.5%), which occurred in the context of the emergency
treatment of patients, many of whom had mucositis or
other gastrointestinal distress, with an oral agent every 6
354

hours. The results from this study demonstrate that uridine triacetate is a safe and highly effective antidote.
In comparison with historical cases, uridine triacetate significantly improved the survival of patients overdosed
with 5-FU or capecitabine. Uridine triacetate (Vistogard;
https://www.vistogard.com/) was approved by the FDA
in December 2015 and is available commercially.
