BACKGROUND. PKC412 is a kinase inhibitor that blocks protein kinase C (PKC),
vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor FLT3, and other class III receptor tyrosine kinases. The enthusiasm for this
compound is based on its inhibitory effect even in the case of FLT3 mutations.
The aim of this study was to analyze the role of FLT3 in pancreatic cancer and to
study the biological activity of combined inhibition of neovascularization and
mitogenesis in this disease.

METHODS. FLT3 expression was analyzed in 18 pancreatic cancer specimens by
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RTQ-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Sixteen pancreatic cancer cell lines were screened for ITD and D835
point mutations of the FLT3 gene. MTT assays and anchorage-independent

reduced and programmed cell death increased. In vivo PKC412 therapy resulted
in a significant inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth with abrogation of tumor
angiogenesis.

ancreatic cancer is an aggressive malignancy with a continuing
dismal prognosis.1,2 Most patients are diagnosed with locally
advanced or metastatic disease, with an expected survival of less
than 1 year even in the case of aggressive palliative therapy.2,3 Carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas remains a major health problem as
the incidence of this disease has increased over the past several decades.4 Today, pancreatic adenocarcinoma is the fourth leading cause
of cancer-related death in the US and the Western world.4
The highly aggressive nature of pancreatic cancer remains to be
elucidated. Without any doubt, the tumor microenvironment and
changes in gene expression profiles may result in activation of oncogenic signaling pathways including tyrosine kinase activation.5–7 For
some cancer entities, identification of key genetic alterations leads
to targeted therapy. Among the receptor tyrosine kinases that can be
constitutively activated by distinct genetic mutations is the FLT3

kinase.8–10 FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase) is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)
family that shares structural similarity with C-FMS,
C-KIT, and PDGFR.11 FLT3 is expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors, in blast cells of
most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
and in AML-derived cell lines.10 Two classes of activating FLT3 mutations have been described, internal
tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) in the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations in the tyrosine
kinase domain (D835).9 Around 12%–35% of AML
patients have ITD mutations, and 5%–10% of AML
patients carry D835 mutations.12,13 Activating FLT3
gene mutations are associated with poor prognosis.14,15 In the case of pancreatic cancer, nothing is
known about FLT3 mutations except that intratumoral gene transfer of the ligand of FLT3 in rats activated proliferation of dendritic cells and natural
killer cells and caused a moderate reduction in tumor growth. This improvement of local tumor control during the first weeks could be explained by an
improved antigen presentation.16
PKC412, a derivate of staurosporine (N-benzoylstaurosporine), is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of Ser/
Thr and Tyr protein kinases that has among its targets
FLT3 receptor signaling, protein kinase C (PKC), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR2),
PDGFRa and PDGFRb as well as c-kit.17,18 PKC412 is
of particular oncological interest because it retains its
inhibitory activity even in the case of the c-kit mutant
D816V, which causes imatinib (Gleevec) resistance.
This compound overrides imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stomach tumors (GIST) patients who
responded well to PKC412 therapy despite imatinib
failure. Therefore, enthusiasts consider PKC412 as the
‘‘new Gleevec’’. PKC412 is currently being used for
AML treatment in a phase 2 trial as molecularly targeted therapy for activating mutations in the FLT3
gene.19 The rationale for analyzing PKC412 in pancreatic cancer is based on its broad inhibitory spectrum
of numerous critical angiogenic and mitogenic pathways, previously shown to be altered in pancreatic
cancer.6,20,21 Preliminary data on FLT3 expression suggest that this receptor may play a role in hematopoietic cell lineages and their stem cells, but almost
nothing is known about its role in solid tumor growth.
Therefore, we analyzed expression of FLT3 in pancreatic cancer and assayed a large number of pancreatic
cancer cell lines for activating mutations in the FLT3
gene. This is of interest as FLT3 has already been
shown to represent a potential therapeutic target for
neuroectodermal tumor cell lines.22 Because PKC412
successfully inhibits FLT3 even in the case of activating mutations, we studied FLT3 expression and evalu-

ated PKC412 as a potential therapeutic compound in
pancreatic cancer growth in vitro and in vivo by using
an orthotopic model for advanced pancreatic cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human Pancreatic Cancer Specimens
Human pancreatic cancer tissues used for RNA
extraction were obtained from 18 patients who were
undergoing resection for pancreatic adenocarcinomas and 18 patients who were undergoing surgery
for alcoholic chronic pancreatitis at the University
Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, and the University of
Heidelberg, Germany. Normal human pancreatic tissue specimens (n 5 16) were obtained through an
organ donor program. Tissue samples for RNA
extraction were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately
after removal in the operating room and stored at
2808C until further analysis. The study protocol was
approved by the ethics committees at the Universities of Bern and Heidelberg.
Immunohistochemistry
Three lm sections of formalin-fixed tissues were
deparaffinized and rehydrated as described previously.20 Immunostaining was performed using the
Dako Envision System (Dako, Carpentaria, Calif)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked, and slides
were incubated in normal goat serum for 30 minutes,
and the primary antibodies were added and incubated at 48C overnight. A rabbit polyclonal antibody
against FLT3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Heidelberg,
Germany) was used in a 1:100 dilution. After thorough rinsing in TBS-Tween, incubation of the secondary antibody labeled with biotin was followed by
incubation with streptavidin-peroxidase and color
development by 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB; Dako, Carpentaria, Calif ) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. To ensure
antibody specificity, control slides were incubated either in the absence of primary antibody or with a
nonspecific IgG antibody. All slides were analyzed by
2 independent observers blinded to patient status,
followed by resolution of any differences by joint
review and consultation with a third observer.
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
All reagents and equipments for mRNA and cDNA
preparation were purchased from Roche (Roche
Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). mRNA was
prepared by automated isolation using the MagNA
Pure LC instrument. RNA was transcribed into cDNA
using the first strand cDNA synthesis kit. Real-time
quantitative PCR was performed with the Light

PKC412 in Therapy of Pancreatic Cancer/El Fitori et al.

Cycler Fast Start DNA SYBR Green kit. The number
of specific transcripts was normalized to housekeeping genes (cyclophilin B and hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase [HPRT]). All primers were
obtained from Search-LC (Heidelberg, Germany).

Cell lines and culture conditions
Overall, 16 pancreatic cancer cell lines were used in
screening experiments for activating FLT3 mutations
as follows: BxPC-3, Capan-1, Capan-2, CMO, MIA
PaCa-2, PANC-1, SU 8686, T3M4, UCLA-2, DAN-G,
HUP-T3, HUP-T4, PA-TU-8902, PA-TU-8988, SPATU-8988T, and YAPC. For positive control experiments, 2 AML cell lines with characterized FLT3
mutations were included (MV4-11, MUTZ-11).9 For
growth characterization in vitro, we used 5 human
pancreatic cancer cell lines as follows: AsPC-1,
BxPC-3, HPAF-II, MIA PaCa-2, and PANC-1. In an
orthotopic murine model for pancreatic cancer, the
AsPC-1 and HPAF-II cell lines were used. Cell lines
were purchased from the American Tissue Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, Md) or the German
Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures
(Braunschweig, Germany). Cell culture conditions
were previously described.20,23 PKC412 was a kind
gift from Novartis AG (Basel, Switzerland). The
doses of PKC412 tested were 0, 1022, 1021, 1, 10 lM,
or an equal volume of DMSO, which was used as
solvent of PKC412.
ITD analysis of the FLT3 gene
Previous studies showed that the location of ITD of
the FLT3 gene was restricted to exons 14 and 15
according to the revised nomenclature.24 Therefore,
genomic PCR amplification was performed by using
the previously described primers as follows: 14 forward: 50 -GCA ATT TAG GTA TGA AAG CCA GC-30 and
15 reverse: 50 -CTT TCA GCA TTT TGA CGG CAA CC30 . High molecular weight DNA was extracted from
the cell lines, and PCR was performed by using 100
ng of genomic DNA in a total volume of 50 lL with a
Cetus DNA thermal cycler (Perkin Elmer, Waltham,
Mass) under the following conditions, 30 seconds at
958C for denaturation, 30 seconds at 568C for annealing, and 2 minutes at 728C for extension.
Analysis of FLT3 D835 point mutations
We amplified sequences within exon 20 of the FLT3
gene by genomic PCR using the primers: 50 -CCG
CCA GGA ACG TGC TTG-30 and 50 -GCA GCC TCA
CAT TGC CCC-30 .15 Exons were named according to
the new nomenclature by Abu-Duhier.24 Oligonucleotides were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, Calif).
PCR conditions were as described for the analysis of

1459

the ITD mutations. Amplified PCR products were
digested with EcoRV and subjected to electrophoresis
on a native 10% polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and observed under ultraviolet light.

Anchorage dependent growth characterization
To determine the cell number, cells were trypsinized,
pelleted by centrifugation for 5 minutes at 1500 rpm,
resuspended in 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS; Herschmann Laborgeräte, Eberstadt, Germany),
and counted with an improved Neugebauer hemocytometer. For cell viability assay, 5000 cells were
seeded per well in triplicate in a 96-well microtiter
plate. After 24 hours incubation, cells were incubated
with PKC412 at various concentrations and different
time points as indicated. Cell viability was measured
by using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) as described.25
Cell proliferation assays
For (3H)thymidine incorporation, 1–3 3 104 cells
were grown for 2 days in complete cell medium and
serum starved for 24 hours. After serum deprivation,
cells were stimulated by a single application of 10
ng/mL vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or
50 ng/mL of recombinant PDGF-BB (Beiersdorf AG,
Hamburg, Germany) in normal cell type-specific
medium, and DNA synthesis was measured by adding 5 lCi of (3H)thymidine (APB, Uppsala, Sweden)
for 6 hours. Cultures were washed with phosphatebuffered saline (PBS), fixed with 5% tricholoroacetic
acid (TCA), and lysed in 500 lL of lysis base containing 0.1 N NaOH 1 1% SDS. Afterward, (3H)thymidine
incorporation was measured by liquid scintillation
counting (Beckman, Fullerton, Calif). The assays were
performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.
Cell cycle analysis and apoptosis assays
For cell-cycle analysis, cells were synchronized nonpharmacologically by serum depletion to induce cell
quiescence.26 In brief, individual cells were spread
out in 6-well plates and were grown to confluence.
Then a fetal calf serum (FCS)-rich medium (10%)
was removed, and cells were incubated in a FCSpoor medium (0.5%) for 48 hours. After synchronization, cells were released from the G1/S arrest by
replating at low density and addition of serum-rich
medium and PKC412.
Samples were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry System, San Jose, Calif) equipped with a 488 nm argonion laser as previously described.27,28 A minimum on
7500 events was collected on each sample. Analysis
of the multivariate data was performed with CELL-

Quest software (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry
Systems, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Cell-cycle analysis of
DNA histograms was performed with ModFit LT software (Verity Software House, Topsham, Me).
To quantify the apoptosis, cells were analyzed for
annexin-V binding by using an annexin–V-FLOUS
Staining Kit (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany). Briefly, cells were washed twice with
phosphate-buffered saline and then resuspended in
100 lL annexin-V staining solution, which consisted of
20 lL fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated,
annexin-V reagent (20 lg/mL), 20 lL isotonic propidium iodide (50 lg/mL), and 1000 lL 1M HEPES buffer
(all supplied by Roche Applied Science, Mannheim,
Germany). Cells were incubated in staining solution
for 10 minutes at 258C. After incubation, 500 lL binding buffer were added, and cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry. Samples were analyzed on a FACScan flow
cytometer equipped with a 15 nW air-cooled 488 nm
argon-ion laser (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry
System, San Jose, Calif ). Because positive annexin-V
staining is seen for apoptotic and necrotic cells, propidium iodide was used to differentiate between these 2
subgroups. Annexin-V positive and propidium iodidepositive cells were considered to be necrotic cells,
whereas annexin-V positive and propidium iodide
negative cells were counted as apoptotic cells.

Anchorage independent growth assay
For soft agar assays, a bottom layer of 1 mL cell typespecific medium containing 0.7% agar (Difco, Detroit,
Mich) and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) was poured
in 6-well plates. Then 10,000 cells were added in 1 mL
of complete culture medium, 0.35% agar, and various
concentrations of PKC412. Cells were incubated in
cell type-specific culture conditions, and after 10
days, MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide) reagent, which is exclusively
metabolized by living cells, was added at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL for vital staining. Colonies
with more than 20 cells were counted manually.
Orthotopic Murine Model for Pancreatic Cancer
Five-week old, male, nude mice (BALB/cA) were
used for subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor implantation as described in detail previously.5 The poorly
differentiated human pancreatic cancer cell line,
AsPC-1, and the more differentiated HPAF-II cell line
were used for xenobiotic tumor induction. After subcutaneous tumor formation, 1 small tumor fragment
(1 mm in diameter) was removed from the subcutaneous tumor and transplanted into the tail of the
pancreas. After orthotopic tumor induction, animals
were randomized to the study cohorts, each consist-

ing of 12 animals. One week after orthotopic tumor
transplantation, treatment was initiated. Animals
were weighed on a regular basis to ensure that a
consistent dose at 100 mg/kg/day of drug was administered. Dosing was performed every 24 hours for
PKC412 by oral gavage of a maximal volume of 150 lL
per animal by using 22-gauge gavage needles. Control animals received the same volume of solvent.
Treatment was continued for 8 weeks or until
sacrifice, which was indicated when clinical signs of
excess tumor burden, such as cachexia or ascites
with abdominal distension, became evident. Tumor
volume was determined after sacrifice by using the
following formula,
tumor volume 5 0.5 3 [length 3 width 3 depth].
Local invasion was classified as the number of
peripancreatic organs that were found to be invaded
by the tumor. Metastatic tumor spread was determined macroscopically at autopsy in all thoracal, abdominal, retroperitoneal, and pelvic organs. All
macroscopic suspicious lesions were confirmed by
microscopic analysis. Metastatic lesions in different
organs were counted, and each different organ was
assigned with 1 point. Therefore, every single point in
the metastatic score represented a different organ of
metastatic spread. Ascites was quantified with standard Eppendorf laboratory pipette (mL) at sacrifice.

Microvessel density analysis
Xenograft tumors were immediately snap frozen, and
frozen sections (2 to 4 lm) were used for immunohistochemistry. Labeling of microvessels was performed with rat antimouse CD31 (Pharmagen, San
Diego, Calif), followed by biotinylated goat antirat Ab
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
Penn) and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Dako, Carpentaria, Calif) according to a protocol previously described.20,25 Quantification of
microvessel density (MVD) was done as described by
Weidner.29–31 Briefly, the 3 areas of highest vessel
density were chosen, and microvessel counts were
obtained at a 3200 magnification, and the mean
number in the 3 fields for each tumor was calculated
and referred to as the MVD count. All measurements
were performed at least twice by a single investigator
blinded to sample identity.
Statistical Analysis
Experiments were done in quadruplicate and repeated
at least 2 times. Results are expressed as mean 
standard error of the mean (SE). Statistical significance was determined by Student t test (P < .05).

FIGURE 1. Expression of FLT3 in pancreatic tissues. (A) Real time quantitative RT-PCR was used to quantify mRNA Expression of FLT3 in 16 normal human
pancreatic specimens, in 18 specimens from chronic pancreatitis and 18 pancreatic cancer samples. FLT3 mRNA expression was significantly down regulated
in cancer and chronic pancreatitis tissues (P < .05). Normalization of expression levels was done using cyclophilin-B as a housekeeping gene. (B) In pancreatic
cancer immunohistochemistry was used to localize FLT3 protein. Immunopositivity was seen in ductal cancer cells, tubular complexes and some interstitial duct
surrounding cells (B, left), whereas desmoplastic tissue was not immunoreactive. In normal pancreatic tissue a moderate immunopositivity was seen in acinar
cells and in islets of Langerhans (B, lower right). Negative controls of corresponding slides are shown as inserts. (* indicates P < .05, unpaired Student t test).

RESULTS
Expression of FLT3 in Pancreatic Disorders
Expression of FLT3 mRNA was determined by realtime quantitative PCR (Fig. 1A), and protein localization in tissues wasperformed by immunohistochemistry (Fig. 1B). Included in this analysis were samples

from 18 pancreatic cancer patients, 18 samples from
patients suffering from alcoholic chronic pancreatitis,
and 16 healthy organ donors. FLT3 mRNA was highest
in normal pancreatic tissue (176.9  30.2 copies/lL),
markedly lower in specimens from chronic pancreatitis (112.1  18.7 copies/lL), and still lower in cancer

specimens (74.44  16.9 copies/lL) (Fig. 1A). However, immunohistochemical staining showed that
FLT3 protein expression was high in ductal cancer
cells (Fig. 1B), tubular complexes (Fig. 1B), and, to
some extent, in interstitial cells surrounding a cancer duct (Fig. 1B, left), whereas no immunopositivity
was detectable in the majority of desmoplastic tissue
surrounding cancerous ducts (Fig. 1B). In specimens
from normal pancreatic tissue, the cell-rich compartment of acinar cells stained moderately positive
for FLT3, which was strongly positive in islets of
Langerhans (Fig. 1B). This may explain why normal
pancreatic tissue specimens exhibited higher mRNA
levels for FLT3 when compared with cancer tissue,
where virtually only duct cells exhibited immunopositivity.

Screening for FLT3 Internal Tandem Repeats
FLT3 ITD has been described frequently in AML
cases. In contrast to AML, there is no previous information on activating FLT3 mutations in pancreatic
cancer cell lines. Therefore, we screened a panel of
16 pancreatic cancer cell lines including 1 sister cell
line (PA-TU-8988S and PA-TU-8988T) for this mutation by genomic and RT-PCR: no pancreatic cancerderived cell line exhibited an ITD. For positive control, we chose 2 well-characterized AML cell lines
(MUTZ-11 and MV4-11), in which only the mutated
allele was expressed (Fig. 2A).
Screening for Activating D835 Point Mutations
D835 point mutations of the FLT3 gene have been
described in 7% of AML cases. Like ITD, they lead to
the constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor
tyrosine kinase. To determine FLT3 D835 point
mutations in pancreatic cancer, 16 pancreatic cancer-derived cell lines, including 1 sister cell line (PATU-8988S and PA-TU-8988T), were screened. To
detect mutations at D835, we took advantage of the
finding that the gene sequence affected exhibited a
GATATC EcoRV restriction site. Thus, products of the
PCR amplifying exon 20 were digested with EcoRV
and subjected to PAGE. The EcoRV site was not
changed in any of the cell lines tested excluding
mutational changes at D835 as reported in AML earlier (Fig. 2B).
PKC412 Inhibited VEGFR Signaling
Whether PKC412 inhibits VEGFR2 and PDGFR signaling in pancreatic cancer was studied by using mitogenesis assays for the 2 cell lines, AsPC-1 and HPAFII. These cell lines were also used for in vivo studies.
VEGF is a known mitogen for pancreatic cancer

FIGURE 2. Screening for activating FLT3 mutations in pancreatic cell lines.
(A) Genomic DNA was isolated and PCR was done with primers detecting internal tandem duplications (ITD) of the FLT3 gene. A panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines including positive controls (MV4-11, MUTZ-11) is shown. None

cells.6,32 Both cell lines increased DNA synthesis upon
VEGF (10 ng/mL) stimulation. This mitogenic effect
was revertible by PKC412 treatment (1 lM) to a DNA
synthesis level well below that of untreated cells (Fig.
3A). To further address whether this observation was
because of VEGFR2 signaling, we used a previously
described retrovirally transformed NIH3T3 cell line either expressing wild type, VEGFR2 (Flk-1 WT), or a
truncated mutant, (Flk-1TM).33,34 A strong mitogenic
response upon VEGF stimulation (10 ng/mL) was
seen in fibroblast cultures stably expressing wild type
VEGFR2 (Flk-1 WT), whereas no increase in DNA synthesis was detectable in cells infected with the dominant negative VEGFR2 retroviruses (Flk-1TM). As in
pancreatic cancer cell experiments, addition of
PKC412 at a dose of 1 lM decreased DNA synthesis
sharply to levels below that of untreated cells.
In the case of recombinant PDGF-BB stimulation
(50 ng/mL), no increase in DNA synthesis was detectable in pancreatic cancer cells, thus indicating
that PDGF did not exert a mitogenic effect in vitro
(data not shown).

FIGURE 3. 3Hthymidine incorporation upon VEGF stimulation and PKC412 treatment: (A) Pancreatic cancer cells (5x104) and the retrovirally transformed
fibroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (B) were grown for 2 days and stimulated with 10 ng/mL of recombinant human VEGF before DNA synthesis was measured. The inhibitory effect of PKC412 was tested by adding the compound 60 minutes before growth factors to a final concentration of 1.0 mM. Fourteen hours after stimulation cells were pulse labeled for 6 hours with 3H-thymidine (0.25 mCi/mL). Values represent means  SE for at least 3 independent experiments, *P < .05
compared with untreated cells; #P < .05 compared with cells stimulated with VEGF.

Whether PKC412 also inhibits VEGFR1 signaling
in pancreatic cancer cells stimulated with 10 ng/mL
VEGF was studied by immunoprecipitation by using
a polyclonal VEGFR1-specific antibody followed by
immunoblotting with PY20 antibody to analyze phosphorylation of VEGFR1. There was, however, no
phosphorylated VEGFR1 detectable in pancreatic
cancer cells upon stimulation with VEGF. In contrast,
in HUVEC cells, which were used as positive control,
phosphorylation was inhibited upon VEGF stimulation and PKC412 therapy (data not shown).
In the case of recombinant PDGF-BB stimulation
(50 ng/mL), no increase in DNA synthesis was detectable in pancreatic cancer cells, thus indicating
that PDGF did not exert a mitogenic effect in vitro
(data not shown).

PKC412 Inhibits Pancreatic Cancer Cell Growth
Culture of pancreatic cancer cell lines in the presence of various doses of PKC412 resulted in a dosedependent and time-dependent growth suppression
as analyzed by cell count (data not shown). A similar
growth inhibitory effect was seen in the MTT assays,
where PKC412 doses of 0, 1022, 1021, 1, 10 lM were
used for up to 96 hours. PKC412 resulted in a timedependent and dose-dependent decrease in cell viability (Fig. 4A, 4B). The IC50 doses were in a range
between 0.25 and 20 lM.
Paralleling the MTT results, a strong growth inhibition was detectable in anchorage independent

growth assays (Fig. 5). The Capan-1 cell line did not
grow in soft agar assays. All other cell lines grew well
in soft agar. Except for the HPAF-II cell line, all cell
lines were significantly growth inhibited (Fig. 5). To
achieve comparable growth inhibition, lower doses
(250 nM PKC412) were needed in soft agar assays
than were needed in monolayer culture experiments.

Cell cycle arrest and induction of programmed
cell death upon PKC412 therapy
To further delineate the previously observed antimitogenic activity of PKC412 in more detail, we analyzed cell-cycle progression and apoptosis in
pancreatic cancer cell lines by FACS analysis (The
Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me). Cells were treated with the GI50 dose of PKC412 (500 nM). After 48
hours, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1, S, and
G2/M phases was determined. The results demonstrated a shift toward the G2 phase and G2/M accumulation in all pancreatic cancer cell lines tested
(Table 1). In BxPC-3 cells, for example, the population of G2/M increased roughly 5-fold after addition
of PKC412. In contrast, in HPAF-II cells, no significant change in cell-cycle distribution was observed
after incubation with PKC412 (Table 1).
Apart from altering cell cycle progression,
PKC412 therapy increased the rate of pancreatic cancer cells undergoing apoptosis in all cell lines tested
(Fig. 6). Quantification of apoptosis with annexin-V
staining showed that PKC412 increased apoptosis in

a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 6). This effect was first significant (P < .05) for
all cell lines at a dose of 0.1 lM PKC412 when treated for 48 hours. The overall potency of induction
depended on the concentration of the compound
and did not primarily depend, for example, on the
differentiation of the individual cell line. The dose
and time dependencies of the effects of PKC412 on
apoptosis overlapped with the corresponding effects
of PKC412 cell viability (Fig. 6).

PKC412 Is Efficacious for the Treatment of Pancreatic
Cancer In Vivo
For in vivo studies, we used an orthotopic murine
model for pancreatic cancer. One week after tumor
induction, treatment was initiated and 100 mg/kg
PKC412 dissolved in DMSO alone was administered.35 PKC412 was well tolerated at the dose regimen used in this study.
In tumor growth studies, treatment was continued for 8 weeks. PKC412 therapy resulted in a significant tumor growth suppression (P < .05) in AsPC-1
xenograft tumors (Fig. 7A). In the HPAF-II cell line,
the overall growth-suppressive efficiency was less
pronounced, but a clear trend was seen. Local tumor
infiltration into peripancreatic organs, such as stomach, liver, and spleen, was lower in the treated group
of animals (Table 2). Production of ascites in AsPC-1
xenografted animals was reduced upon the administration of PKC412 therapy (Table 2).

FIGURE 5. Effect of PKC412 on anchorage independent growth. For soft
agar assays 103 to 104 pancreatic cancer cells were seeded on a bottom
layer. PKC412 was added to a final concentration of 250 nM and for controls
equivalent DMSO was used. After 10 days of culture MTT reagent was added
as described in ‘‘Methods’’. Colonies with more than 20 cells were counted.

Because of encouraging results from tumor
growth studies, we initiated an additional survival

animals were treated until death. In this experiment,

survival time was significantly increased in PKC412
treated AsPC-1 xenograft-bearing mice when compared with untreated control animals (Fig. 7C).

Microvessel Density Analysis
Because of the broad spectrum of inhibitory molecular targets of PKC412, including many of the
angiogenic receptors such as VEGFR2 and PDGFRa
and PDGFRb, we analyzed whether PKC412 influences the angiogenic phenotype. For specific identification, we stained tumor specimens with an
antimouse CD31 antibody, a specific marker for
blood vessel endothelium. Both xenografted tumor
cell lines treated with PKC412 displayed a significantly lower number of CD31-positive blood vessels than the sham-treated animals (Fig. 8). This in

vivo finding is in line with our in vitro observation
that PKC412 blocked VEGF-induced mitogenesis
via VEGFR2 (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
Pancreatic cancer remains a challenging disease,
especially because more than half of patients require
palliative therapy at the time of diagnosis. Despite
general efficacy of palliative chemotherapy, the proof
of any major effectiveness in selected controlled clinical trials remains to be shown.3 Therefore, new strategies are required to treat pancreatic cancer. Among
the most promising new therapies is molecularly
targeted therapy with small-molecule inhibitors of
angiogenesis and novel antimitogenic compounds.
PKC412 is a novel small-molecule inhibitor with a
broad spectrum of inhibitory activity against Ser/Thr
and Tyr protein kinases, including FLT3, PKC,
VEGFR2, c-KIT, PDGFRa, and PDGFRb.18 In contrast
to imatinib (Gleevec), PKC412 maintains its inhibitory
function even in the case of activating FLT3 mutations.35 By its broad inhibitory activity, PKC412 may
simultaneously target angiogenic and mitogenic pathways thus carrying the potential for abrogating several
crucial pathways in cancer growth and metastasis.6
Because FLT3 has never been studied in pancreatic cancer, we determined expression of FLT3 in
pancreatic cancer and tested an array of pancreatic
cancer cell lines for activating FLT3 mutations. FLT3
expression was reduced on mRNA level in cancer tis-

Local invasion score is the number of peripancreatic organs that were found to be invaded by the

which metastases were identified. Each point in this score represents a different organ of metastatic
dissemination. (*P < .05, Student t-test).

sues; even so, a strong immunopositivity was found in
ductal cancer cells suggesting that FLT3 protein may
accumulate by a yet unknown mechanism in cancer
cells. Because ductal cancer cells confer to only 10%
of the cell pool in pancreatic cancer specimens, quantification of mRNA resulted in a higher FLT3 mRNA
expression in normal pancreatic tissue, where likely
the large number of acinar cells contributed to the
overall higher FLT3 levels in normal tissues when
compared with cell-sparse cancer tissues. This finding
was confirmed by confirmatory microdissection studies performed in a few preliminary experiments. So
far, no mechanism nor function has been identified
that stimulated expression of FLT3 in solid tumors
in vivo. A PCR-based analysis of 16 cultured pancreatic

cancer cell lines was conducted to identify possible
FLT3 ITD or D835 point mutations. No FLT3 ITD
mutation and no D835 mutation were detectable in
any of the pancreatic cancer cell lines tested. Next,
growth-modulating effects of PKC412 were tested in
monolayer cell cultures. Consistently a strong antimitogenic activity was detectable in a dose-dependent
and time-dependent manner in pancreatic cancer cell
lines. This was particularly true for anchorage independent growth assays. Growth inhibition was
mediated by a strong cell-cycle arrest in the G2/Mphase, where cell cycle progression had been blocked
upon administration of PKC412 as investigated by flow
cytometry. Furthermore, a significant increase in the
rate of apoptotic cells upon PKC412 therapy was detectable in all cell lines tested. The strong in vitro activity led us to test this potentially promising
compound in vivo by using a highly metastatic orthotopic murine model for pancreatic cancer. Tumor
growth was reduced in AsPC-1 and HPAF-II animals
treated with PKC412; however, the difference reached
significance only in AsPC-1 xenograft tumors. Metastatic tumor dissemination and production of ascites
were reduced upon PKC412 therapy. Because of the
promising growth studies for AsPC-1 xenograft tumors,
we tested whether survival was different upon PKC412
treatment and found that therapy with PKC412 prolonged survival significantly in this model. Most likely,
cell-cycle progression contributed to slower tumor
growth in PKC412-treated animals. Apart from direct

mitogenic effects; we analyzed the possibility that tumor neoangiogenesis may be different between treated
and untreated animals. In both cell lines, the angiogenic phenotype was reduced upon PKC412 therapy.
This finding is in line with the in vitro observation
where PKC412 decreased VEGF-mediated cell-growth
stimulation suggesting that VEGFR2 is 1 of the cellular
targets of PKC412. Despite the detailed mechanisms responsible for the antiangiogenic activity of PKC412 are
not fully characterized inhibition of VEGFR2 signaling
suppresses 1 of the most potent angiogenic pathways.
In summary, FLT3 expression is gradually decreased in pancreatic cancer when compared with
normal pancreas even when pancreatic cancer cells
express this receptor. In contrast to AML, there were
no activating mutations in the FLT3 gene in pancreatic
cancer cell lines. The strong antitumor activity of
PKC412 in pancreatic cancer is likely not related to
FLT3 signaling but was most likely because of a sum of
effects including simultaneously targeting cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. From these data, we
conclude that PKC412 extends the list of promising
biologically active antiangiogenic target compounds,
which await further evaluation under clinical settings.
