Abstract
We sought to determine whether nucleolin, a bcl-2 mRNAbinding protein, has a role in the regulation of bcl-2 mRNA
stability in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, we examined the efficacy of the aptamer AS1411 in
targeting nucleolin and inducing bcl-2 mRNA instability and
cytotoxicity in these cells. AS1411 at 5 Mmol/L inhibited the
growth of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas 20 Mmol/L
AS1411 had no effect on the growth rate or viability of normal
MCF-10A mammary epithelial cells. This selectivity of AS1411
was related to a greater uptake of AS1411 into the cytoplasm
of MCF-7 cells compared with MCF-10A cells and to a 4-fold
higher level of cytoplasmic nucleolin in MCF-7 cells. Stable
siRNA knockdown of nucleolin in MCF-7 cells reduced
nucleolin and bcl-2 protein levels and decreased the halflife of bcl-2 mRNA from 11 to 5 hours. Similarly, AS1411
(10 Mmol/L) decreased the half-life of bcl-2 mRNA in MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 cells to 1.0 and 1.2 hours, respectively. In
contrast, AS1411 had no effect on the stability of bcl-2 mRNA
in normal MCF-10A cells. AS1411 also inhibited the binding of
nucleolin to the instability element AU-rich element 1 of bcl-2
mRNA in a cell-free system and in MCF-7 cells. Together, the
results suggest that AS1411 acts as a molecular decoy by
competing with bcl-2 mRNA for binding to cytoplasmic
nucleolin in these breast cancer cell lines. This interferes with
the stabilization of bcl-2 mRNA by nucleolin and may be one
mechanism by which AS1411 induces tumor cell death. [Cancer

Introduction
Aptamers are short DNA, RNA, or peptide oligomers that assume
specific and stable three-dimensional structures in solution and in
cells. The 26-mer DNA aptamer AS1411 is currently undergoing
clinical evaluation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This guaninerich aptamer has unmodified phosphodiester linkages and forms a
G-quadruplex structure (1) that is resistant to degradation by
serum enzymes (2). The stable conformation of AS1411 allows it to
bind to its target protein with high affinity and specificity (3).
Although AS1411 is known to bind to nucleolin with high affinity,
the biological consequences of this interaction are not well understood. Because nucleolin is a multifunctional protein that interacts

with both DNA and RNA, binding of AS1411 to nucleolin could
interfere with a variety of cellular activities. For example, there is
evidence that nucleolin, via binding of its RNA binding and COOHterminal domains to pre-rRNA, functions as an assembly factor by
bringing together the correctly folded rRNA and other components
necessary for rRNA maturation and ribosome assembly (4). This
protein may also be involved in exporting ribosome components
to the cytoplasm while shuttling between the cytoplasm and
nucleus (5). A considerable body of evidence supports a critical
role for nucleolin in mRNA stabilization. Nucleolin binds to the
3¶-untranslated region (3¶-UTR) of amyloid precursor protein
mRNA and stabilizes this mRNA (6). It is also required for the
stabilization of interleukin-2 mRNA that occurs during T-cell
activation (7). More recent studies have shown that nucleolin binds
to an AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3¶-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA in HL-60
(8) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (9) and stabilizes this
mRNA by protecting it from RNase degradation.
The results of recent studies on the stabilization of bcl-2 mRNA
by nucleolin in human leukemia cells have provided insights
into possible mechanisms of action and antitumor selectivity
of AS1411. Nucleolin protein expression is usually higher in tumor
cells than in normal or premalignant cells (9–12). The overexpression of nucleolin in tumor cells is not simply related to a
higher proliferation rate of tumor cells compared with normal cells
because nonproliferating chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells isolated from patients overexpressed nucleolin protein 26-fold
relative to normal human CD19+ B cells (9). However, a striking
difference between the chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and
the normal B cells was that nucleolin was detected only in the
nucleus of normal B cells but was present in the nucleus and
cytoplasm of chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. It has been
proposed that AS1411 first binds to nucleolin on the external
surface of tumor cells and then is internalized (13). In this regard,
AS1411 may exploit the shuttling activity of nucleolin to gain
intracellular access. Once inside the cell, AS1411 is thought to act
as a ‘‘molecular decoy’’ by binding with high affinity to nucleolin
and thereby interfering with its intracellular functions (13). For
example, recent evidence suggests that AS1411 forms a complex
with nucleolin and nuclear factor-nB essential modulator, which
prevents nuclear factor-nB activation (14). Normal cells may be
deficient in both AS1411 uptake and in the intracellular target of
AS1411 because normal cells seem to have much lower levels of
nucleolin in both plasma membrane and cytoplasm (9). These
properties of AS1411 may provide the basis, at least in part, for
the lack of serious toxicity reported in a phase I clinical oncology
trial of AS1411 (13).
The work described herein compares the effects of AS1411 on
nucleolin activity in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cells, and MCF-10A normal mammary epithelial cells.
Specifically, our goal was to identify the biochemical mechanisms

involved in the selective induction of apoptosis by AS1411 in these
breast cancer cell lines relative to the normal MCF-10A cells.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. All cultures were grown in a humidified incubator
maintained at 37jC with 95% air/5% CO2. MCF-10A normal human
mammary epithelial cells were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection and were propagated in MEGM complete growth medium
supplemented with bovine pituitary extract (Cambrex Bioscience). MCF-7
and MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells were grown in RPMI 1640 and
DMEM, respectively, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine
serum, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 100 units/mL penicillin. Cell counting
and measurements of cell viability were carried out as described (15). The
numbers of apoptotic cells were determined by counting the FITC-labeled
Annexin V–positive cells in a flow cytometer. AS1411, with sequence
5¶-d(GGTGGTGGTGGTTGTGGTGGTGGTGG)-3¶, and 5¶-FITC-AS1411 were
obtained from (Antisoma Research, Ltd.). AS1411 was dissolved in tissue
culture media before addition to cell cultures and was dissolved in water for
the cell-free experiments.
Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblotting was done as previously
described (15). For determination of cytosolic nucleolin and total cellular
bcl-2 proteins, cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (15), followed
by centrifugation at 10,000  g for 15 min at 4jC. The S10 supernatant is
referred to as the S10 cytosolic extract and the pellet is termed the S10
nuclear pellet. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Aliquots of the S10 cytosolic extracts containing
25 Ag of protein were electrophoresed on a 12% polyacrylamide SDS gel and
transblotted. Antihuman bcl-2 monoclonal antibody (mAb; clone Bcl-2 100),
antihuman nucleolin mAb (clone MS-3), and antigoat actin polyclonal
antibody (I-19) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The
amounts of each protein in the blots were determined by counting the total
numbers of pixels in each band (integrated density value) with
ChemiImager digital imaging system (Alpha Innnotech) and/or Typhoon
PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Values that were within the linear range
of the assay were normalized to either h-actin for the cytosolic extracts or
histone 2B for the nuclear extracts.

Confocal microscopy. Cells were grown on MatTek plates (MatTek Corp.).
To stain plasma membrane and cytoplasmic nucleolin, the cells were fixed
for 20 min at room temperature in PBS (140 mmol/L NaCl, 2.7 mmol/L KCl,
10 mmol/L Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmol/L KH2PO4, pH 7.4) containing 4% paraformaldehyde. Nonspecific binding of antibody was blocked with 3% bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and 1% goat serum in PBS (blocking buffer) for 1 h at
room temperature. The cells were incubated overnight at 4jC with primary
anti-nucleolin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, clone MS-3; 1:100
dilution in blocking buffer), washed thrice in PBS, and incubated with
secondary FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (diluted 1:100 in blocking
buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. RNA in the fixed cells was digested with
RNase A (100 Ag/mL for 15 min at room temperature) and propidium iodide
(4 Ag/mL) was used to stain DNA. The cells were washed thrice in PBS and
then observed under a Carl Zeiss LSM5 Pascal confocal microscope.
Confocal images (1,024  768 pixels) were obtained using a 63 objective
lens and the images were overlaid using Carl Zeiss LSM Pascal image
browser 4.0 software. Confocal images of 5¶-FITC-AS1411 were also carried
out using this procedure.
Measurement of Bcl-2 mRNA stability. MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or MCF10A cells were incubated with no drug, 10 Amol/L AS1411, or 20 Amol/L
CRO26 for 72 h. The cells were then incubated with either 0.5% ethanol or
3 Ag/mL actinomycin D in 0.5% ethanol. Aliquots were removed from the
cultures at times 0, 2, 4, and 8 h. Actinomycin D at this concentration did
not induce any DNA fragmentation during this time period. At the various
time points, 2  107 cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed with
PBS. Total RNA was isolated using TriZol (Invitrogen), and the RNA
concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically at 260 nm. Equal
amounts of total RNA (2–5 Ag) from each sample were reverse transcribed
using Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase and
random hexamers. PCR amplification of the cDNAs was carried out with
primer pairs for the bcl-2 message (5¶-GGAAGTGAACATTTCGGTGAC-3¶; 5¶GC CTC TC CTC AC GTT C C C-3¶) a nd th e b- a c t i n m e ss a g e ( 5 ¶GCGGGAAATCGTGCGTGACAT-3¶; 5¶-GATGGAGTTGAAGGTA-GTTC-3¶).
All PCR primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.
The reaction mixture contained 200 nmol/L dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP;
primers at 200 nmol/L each; 2.5 units of HotStart Taq DNA polymerase
(Qiagen), which lacks 3¶-5¶ exonuclease activity; 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2; and 1 AL

of cDNA product in a final volume of 25 AL. The HotStart Taq DNA
polymerase was activated by a 15-min incubation at 95jC in the thermal
cycler. This was followed by template denaturation for 1 min at 94jC,
primer-template annealing for 1 min at 57jC, and then primer extension for
1 min at 72jC. After 26 cycles for bcl-2 and 24 cycles for h-actin, the
extension reactions were continued for an additional 7 min at 72jC. The
PCR products were separated on a 1% agarose gel and stained with
ethidium bromide, and product formation was quantitated by determining
the integrated density value of each band. Product formation was linear
over the range of the amounts of cDNA and PCR cycles used.
Coimmunoprecipitation of nucleolin-Bcl-2 mRNA complexes. Immunoprecipitation of nucleolin-bcl-2 mRNA complexes was done as
previously described (8) with the following modifications. Briefly, cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 100  g for 5 min at 4jC and then suspended
in 10 mL of PBS. Formaldehyde was added to the cell suspension to a final
concentration of 1.0% (v/v) and the reaction was incubated at room
temperature for 10 min with slow mixing. Cross-linking was quenched by
the addition of glycine (pH 7.0, 0.125 mol/L final concentration), followed by
incubation of the mixture at room temperature for 5 min. The cells were
washed thrice with 10 mL of PBS and once with 1.0 mL of RIPA buffer (16).
The pellet was resuspended in 0.5-mL RIPA buffer and sonicated for three
rounds of 20 s each at output level 7 of a Misonix 300 sonicator (Fisher
Scientific). The sonicated samples were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min
at 17,000  g, and the supernatants were split into two 0.25-mL aliquots
and used immediately for immunoprecipitation. One aliquot was saved as
the input sample and the other aliquot was mixed with 20 AL of Protein
A-Sepharose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at 4jC followed by
centrifugation at 400  g for 5 min. The precleared supernatant was diluted
with 250-AL RIPA buffer containing RNasin and protease inhibitors, mixed
with either anti-nucleolin (3 Ag/mL) or IgG mAb (3 Ag/mL), and incubated
overnight with shaking at 4jC. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added and

the samples were incubated with shaking for 3 h at 4jC. The Sepharose
beads were washed five times with high stringency buffer (16) and then
incubated at 70jC for 45 min to reverse cross-linking. RNA was extracted
from the input and the immunoprecipitated samples using TriZol and then
treated with DNase I. The RNA was used to synthesize cDNA using random
hexamer primers and MMLV reverse transcriptase as described above.
Reverse transcription reactions were carried out for 1 h at 42jC. Real-time
quantitative PCR was done using 2 AL of the cDNA sample for 40 cycles of
amplification. The PCR primers for bcl-2 ARE-1 mRNA were 5¶-CAGTCTTCAGGCAAAACGTCGA-3¶ and 3¶-TGGTCGGATTTCCAAAGACA-5¶. Amplification of 18S rRNA was carried out using the Quantum RNA Universal 18S Kit
from Ambion, Inc., and served as an internal control for data normalization.
The fold enrichment of bcl-2 mRNA sequences in the immunoprecipitates
relative to the nonprecipitated imput samples was calculated using the
standard DDC t method (Stratagene Introduction to Quantitative PCR manual
IN #70200-00).
RNA gel mobility shift assay. This assay was done as previously
described (17). Recombinant nucleolin was generated using a bacterial
expression vector (pET21a) containing cDNA sequences that code for
residues 284 to 707 of human nucleolin [D1–283 Nuc-(His)6; refs. 8, 18].
Briefly, 50 nmol/L of recombinant nucleolin, a 29-nucleotide (nt) bcl-2 ARE-1
RNA sequence (50 nmol/L, 20,000 cpm), and 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, 50, and
100 nmol/L concentrations of competitor AS1411 were incubated on ice for 10
min in 20 AL of RNA binding buffer [50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 0.025 mg/mL tRNA, 0.25 mg/mL BSA]. Five microliters of gel loading
solution (50% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, 0.1% xylene-cyanol) were then
added to the reaction, and 10 AL of each reaction mixture were analyzed on a
6% PAGE/Tris-borate EDTA gel, which was dried on nitrocellulose paper and
analyzed by phosphorimaging with Typhoon PhosphorImager.

transfected with a plasmid expressing a scrambled siRNA with limited
homology to any known human genomic sequence. The nucleolin and
scrambled siRNA sequences in the G418-resistant clones were confirmed by
sequencing.
Total RNA was extracted from the transfectants using TriZol reagent.
Nucleolin and bcl-2 mRNA levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR in the
stable clones. cDNA synthesis was done using 2 Ag of total RNA as described
above. The primers for nucleolin and bcl-2 were 5¶-CCAGCCATCCAAAACTCTGT-3¶ and 5¶-TAACTATCCT-TGCCCGAACG-3¶ and 5¶ATGTGTGTGGAGAGCGTCAA-3¶ and 5¶-ACAGTTCCACAAAGGCATCC-3¶,
respectively. The primers for h-actin were 5¶-AAATCTGGCACCACACCTTC-3¶ and 5¶-GGGGTGTTGAAGGTCTCAAA-3¶. All primers were
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. cDNA was amplified
using a Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix from Stratagene. The
reaction was carried out at 95jC for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95jC
for 30 s, 53jC for 90 s, and 72jC for 60 s. Nucleolin and bcl-2 mRNAs were
quantified and normalized relative to h-actin mRNA. Each reaction was
done in duplicate and the comparative C t method was used for relative
quantification of gene expression.

Results
Effect of AS1411 on the growth and viability of human
MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-10A cells. Initial studies were
done to compare the relative sensitivities of MCF-7 and MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells and MCF-10A normal breast epithelial cells
to AS1411. AS1411 at 5 Amol/L completely inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 cells but loss of mitochondrial activity was not
observed until 72 hours after drug exposure (Fig. 1A and C).
However, 20 Amol/L CRO26 [5¶-d(CCTCCTCCTCCTTCTCCTCCTCCTCC)-3¶], a 26-mer cytosine-rich control oligonucleotide that
does not form a stabilized quadruplex structure (1, 2), had no effect
on either MCF-7 cell growth (Fig. 1A) or mitochondrial activity
(Fig. 1C). Consistent with the results of the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-

2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, the AS1411treated cells became apoptotic by 72 hours. At 72 hours, 5 F 0.1%,
44 F 16%, and 59 F 3% of the MCF-7 cells incubated with 0, 5, or
10 Amol/L AS1411, respectively, were Annexin V positive. These
data indicate that AS1411 first induces a cytostatic effect in MCF-7
cells, which is then followed by cell death. AS1411 had similar
effects on the growth rate and mitochondrial activity of MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast to that
observed with the breast cancer cell lines, 20 Amol/L AS1411 had
no effect on the growth rate (Fig. 1B), mitochondrial activity
(Fig. 1D), or viability (data not shown) of normal MCF-10A cells
following exposure times as long as 96 hours.
The greater sensitivity of MCF-7 breast cancer cells to AS1411
compared with normal MCF-10A cells was related to the more
extensive uptake of AS1411 into MCF-7 cells (Fig. 2A). The
intracellular localization of AS1411 was determined by confocal
imaging of FITC-conjugated AS1411 fluorescence after a 1-hour
incubation of the cells with 2 Amol/L drug. The cells were incubated
with propidium iodide to counterstain the nuclei (red fluorescence).
Figure 2A shows that the accumulation of AS1411 was much greater
in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells than in MCF-10A cells. Both cell lines
showed a punctate distribution of AS1411 in the nucleus.
Expression and localization of nucleolin in MCF-7, MDAMB-231, and MCF-10A cells. AS1411 has been shown to bind
tightly to nucleolin in some tumor cells (3). Thus, we determined
the relative amounts and intracellular localization of nucleolin in
MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells to determine whether differences in
either the expression levels or localization of nucleolin in these cell
lines were related to the greater sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to
AS1411. We compared the relative levels of nucleolin and bcl-2
proteins in MCF-7 and MCF-10A cells by immunoblotting S10
supernatants of these cells. We chose to analyze S10 supernatants
to permit measurement of nonnuclear nucleolin, which we

Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2 indicate that nucleolin was
present throughout the nucleus (yellow fluorescence) and cytoplasm (green fluorescence) of MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-231 cells,
whereas in MCF-10 cells nucleolin was detected only in the
nucleus. When taken together, the results in Figs. 1–3A indicate
that MCF-7 breast cancer cells show greater uptake of AS1411 into
the cytoplasm, higher cytoplasmic levels of nucleolin, and much
greater sensitivity to AS1411 than normal MCF-10A cells.
AS1411 inhibits the stabilization of Bcl-2 mRNA by nucleolin
in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Our previous studies with HL60 leukemia cells (8) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells from
patients (9) showed that nucleolin binds to an ARE instability

postulate is directly involved in bcl-2 mRNA stabilization, and
mitochondrial bcl-2 protein in the same cell extract. This analysis
revealed that full-length nucleolin protein (106 kDa) and its
degradation products (19) were 4-fold elevated (P < 0.007) in S10
cytoplasmic extracts of MCF-7 cells compared with MCF-10A cells
(Fig. 2B). No statistically significant differences in the nuclear
(S10 pellet) levels of nucleolin were observed between MCF-7 and
MCF-10A cells (P > 0.05). Immunoblotting also revealed high levels
of cytosolic nucleolin in S10 extracts of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer
cells (Supplementary Fig. S2) compared with MCF-10A cells (Fig.
2B). The nuclear protein histone 2B was not detected in the blots of
the S10 extracts from MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, or normal MCF-10A
cells. Thus, the presence of high levels of nucleolin in the S10
cytoplasmic extracts of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells was not
consistent with the contamination of the S10 extracts with nuclear
nucleolin. Bcl-2 protein was detected in both the cytosolic and
nuclear fractions from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but was
undetectable in the S10 cytosol from MCF-10A cells.
Results from confocal microscopy studies on the localization of
nucleolin (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2) were consistent with
the immunoblotting data. The intracellular localization of nucleolin
was determined by indirect immunofluorescence with primary
antibody against nucleolin and a FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG
secondary antibody (green fluorescence). The DNA was stained
with propidium iodide (red fluorescence). The overlay images in

complexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-nucleolin antibody. The bcl-2 mRNA
in the immunoprecipitates was analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR with bcl-2
ARE-1 mRNA primers. Columns, mean of three experiments; bars, SE.

element in the 3¶-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA and protects this mRNA from
degradation (8, 9). Experiments were done to determine whether
nucleolin has a similar activity in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells
and if AS1411 could interfere with the stabilization of bcl-2 mRNA
by nucleolin in these cell lines. If nucleolin is an important transacting factor required for the stabilization of bcl-2 mRNA, then
knockdown of nucleolin with a siRNA should lead to destabilization of bcl-2 mRNA. To test this, nucleolin was knocked down
partially in MCF-7 breast cancer cells by transfecting the cells with
a nucleolin siRNA plasmid. Complete knockdown of nucleolin was
not compatible with survival of the MCF-7 cells. Control MCF-7
cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing a scrambled siRNA

with limited homology to any known human genomic sequence.
Nucleolin and bcl-2 mRNA levels were determined by real-time
PCR analysis in two MCF-7 clones transfected with a scrambled
siRNA and four clones transfected with the nucleolin siRNA. The
levels of nucleolin mRNA and bcl-2 mRNA in the stable nucleolin
siRNA–transfected clones were reduced to 24 F 3% SE and 17 F
5% SE, respectively, of the corresponding levels measured in the
two MCF-7 clones transfected with the scrambled siRNA. To
determine if the reduction in bcl-2 mRNA was the result of
decreased mRNA stability, the half-life of bcl-2 mRNA was
measured after incubation of the clones with actinomycin D to
block transcription. The half-life of bcl-2 mRNA was 5 hours in the
nucleolin siRNA–transfected clones and 11 hours in the scrambled
siRNA clone (Fig. 4). Western blot analysis of the transfectants
revealed that the levels of full-length nucleolin (106 kDa) and its
proteolysis products (19) were down-regulated in all four clones
transfected with the nucleolin siRNA compared with the two clones
transfected with the scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3B). Equally important,
nucleolin knockdown was accompanied by down-regulation of bcl2 protein, but not h-actin, in the four clones transfected with the
nucleolin siRNA. These results indicate that nucleolin downregulation in MCF-7 cells leads to bcl-2 mRNA instability and
decreased levels of bcl-2 protein in MCF-7 cells.
Similar to the nucleolin siRNA, the nucleolin-targeting aptamer
AS1411 also decreased the stability of bcl-2 mRNA. The half-life of
bcl-2 mRNA was reduced from 10 hours in untreated MCF-7 cells
to 1 hour in MCF-7 cells incubated with 10 Amol/L AS1411 for 72
hours (Fig. 5A). Likewise, AS1411 reduced the half-life of bcl-2
mRNA in MDA-MB-231 cells from 11 to 1.2 hours (Fig. 5C). In
contrast, 10 Amol/L AS1411 had no effect on the stability of bcl-2
mRNA in normal MCF-10A cells (Fig. 5B).
AS1411 interferes with binding of nucleolin to bcl-2 mRNA.
Further studies examined the effect of AS1411 on the binding of
bcl-2 mRNA to either purified recombinant nucleolin or
endogenous nucleolin in MCF-7 cells. As a first step in mapping
of the binding site of nucleolin on bcl-2 ARE-1, binding of
recombinant nucleolin to four contiguous fragments of the ARE
was examined ( fragments 5¶-A,B,C,D-3¶). Human recombinant
nucleolin [D1–283Nuc-(His)6] was found to bind with highest
affinity to fragment B, which consists of a 29-nt sequence, 5¶CCAAAGGGAAAUAUCAUUUAUUUUUUACA-3¶, located 70 nt
downstream from the bcl-2 stop codon. This AU-rich sequence
contains the pentamer AUUUA within the loop of a potential
stem-loop structure and binds to human nucleolin [D1–283Nuc(His)6] in gel shift assays with high affinity [average association
constant, 0.38 (nmol/L) 1; range of two experiments, 0.31–0.48
(nmol/L) 1]. Competition binding assays were then done with the
29-nt bcl-2 ARE sequence and either AS1411 (Fig. 6A) or the
control C-rich oligonucleotide (CRO26; Fig. 6B) for binding to
human recombinant nucleolin. Assays were done with a fixed
amount of the 29-nt ARE sequence in the presence of increasing
concentrations of AS1411 or CRO26. Fig. 6A reveals a dosedependent decrease in nucleolin binding to the bcl-2 ARE element
with increasing concentrations of unlabeled AS1411. Quantitation
of the data in Fig. 6A revealed that AS1411 at 25 and 37.5 nmol/L
reduced binding of the 29-nt bcl-2-ARE sequence (50 nmol/L)
to nucleolin to 58 F 0.1% SE and 38 F 0.1% SE, respectively,
compared with reactions lacking AS1411. In contrast, the control
oligonucleotide CRO26, which lacks antiproliferative activity
(Fig. 1), had no significant effect on the binding of the bcl-2ARE sequence to nucleolin (Fig. 6B). These results indicate that

AS1411 competes effectively with bcl-2 ARE RNA for binding to
recombinant nucleolin in a cell-free assay.
Inhibition of nucleolin binding to bcl-2 mRNA by AS1411 in
MCF-7 cells was examined by incubating the cells with 0, 5, or
10 Amol/L AS1411 for 72 hours, followed by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous nucleolin-bcl-2 mRNA complexes with antinucleolin antibody. The RNA was then reversed transcribed and
real-time quantitative PCR was done using primers specific for bcl2 mRNA. The fold enrichment of bcl-2 mRNA sequences in the
immunoprecipitates over nonprecipitated input RNA was reduced
from 72 F 0.1 SE (control) to 20 F 0.34 SE (72% decrease) and 1 F
0.1 SE (99% decrease) in cells incubated with 5 and 10 Amol/L
AS1411, respectively (Fig. 6C). Thus, AS1411, at a minimally
cytotoxic concentration (5 Amol/L, Fig. 1), was able to inhibit
binding of nucleolin to bcl-2 mRNA in MCF-7 cells. In summary,
Fig. 6A and C suggests that AS1411 acts as a molecular decoy in
MCF-7 cells by competing with bcl-2 RNA for binding to nucleolin.

Discussion
AS1411 represents a new paradigm for cancer therapy because it
is the first aptamer to be evaluated in human oncology trials and
seems to be the first anticancer agent shown to induce mRNA
instability. It has shown both promising antitumor activity and a
lack of serious systemic toxicity in a phase I trial (13). A program of
phase II studies, including trials in AML, is now under way.
The nucleic acid binding protein nucleolin is thought to be an
important cellular target for AS1411. Nucleolin has been shown to
bind to G-quadruplex–forming DNA sequences (3, 20). Thus, the
stable G-quadruplex structure of AS1411 may promote high affinity
and specific binding of the aptamer to nucleolin. In this regard,
AS1411 may function as a chemical antibody’ (21). The results
reported herein are supportive of this concept. Figure 6A and C
shows that AS1411 was a potent inhibitor of nucleolin binding to
bcl-2 mRNA in a cell-free system and in MCF-7 cells.
Based on the data presenter herein, a molecular decoy model of
AS1411 action is proposed to explain the much greater toxicity of
AS1411 to tumor cells compared with normal cells. According to
this model, the high antitumor selectivity of AS1411 is the result of
overexpression of nucleolin in the cytoplasm and possibly the
plasma membrane of tumor cells compared with normal cells.
Immunoblotting and confocal microscopy showed that nucleolin
was overexpressed in CD19+ chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells
from patients relative to CD19+ B cells from healthy human
volunteers (9). Previous studies showed that cytoplasmic nucleolin
binds to the ARE-1 instability element in the 3¶-UTR of bcl-2 mRNA
and protects this mRNA from degradation (8). Nucleolin is an
important protein involved in bcl-2 mRNA stabilization because
siRNA knockdown of nucleolin is sufficient to induce bcl-2 mRNA
destabilization and down-regulation (Fig. 3B ). In addition,
recombinant nucleolin alone, when added to S100 extracts of
normal CD19+ B cells, slowed the rate of bcl-2 mRNA decay to that

observed in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells (9). Thus, in MCF-7
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, bcl-2 mRNA is abnormally
stabilized, which allows the tumor cells to overproduce bcl-2
protein and avoid apoptosis.
It follows from this model that AS1411, by acting as a molecular
decoy, competes with bcl-2 ARE mRNA for binding to nucleolin and
thereby induces bcl-2 mRNA instability and apoptosis. This will
occur to a much greater extent in tumor cells such as MCF-7 cells
and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells than in normal cells
because normal cells do not overexpress nucleolin in the cytoplasm
and do not depend on stabilization of bcl-2 mRNA for survival.
Antitumor selectivity may be obtained at an additional level. It has
been proposed that AS1411 binds to nucleolin that is present on
the external surface of tumor, but not normal, cells and gains
intracellular access when nucleolin is shuttled from the plasma
membrane to the cytoplasm and nucleus (13). This hypothesis is
consistent with our observation that AS1411 accumulated to a
much greater extent in the cytoplasm of MCF-7 cells compared
with MCF-10A cells. Our confocal microscopy images are also
consistent with the presence of nucleolin on the cell surface of
MCF-7 and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells, but not on normal
mammary epithelial cells or normal CD19+ B cells (9). Nevertheless,
further studies are required on the putative role of nucleolin as a
cell-surface receptor for AS1411 in tumor cells.
Because nucleolin is a multifunctional protein, it is possible
that binding of AS1411 to nucleolin interferes with multiple
biological activities in tumor cells. Inhibition of DNA synthesis is
observed in tumor cells that are sensitive to G-rich DNA
aptamers (22). This may be related to formation of complexes
of the aptamers with nucleolin and nuclear factor-nB essential
modulator, which prevents nuclear factor-nB activation and cell
growth signaling (14). However, inhibition of DNA synthesis by
AS1411 is likely not the only mode of action of this aptamer. We
have found that AS1411 induces apoptosis in indolent chronic
lymphocytic leukemia cells that are not replicating DNA, as
evidenced by the negligible rate of [3H]thymidine incorporation
into DNA in these cells.3 The ability of AS1411 to induce
apoptosis in indolent tumor cells via down-regulation of bcl-2
protein3 suggests that this aptamer may show activity against
some solid tumors that have a low growth fraction. The strong
mechanistic rationale for the antitumor effects of a nucleolin
targeting aptamer combined with predictive preclinical pharmacology and promising phase I clinical results underpins further
investigation of AS1411 in cancer clinical trials.
