Abstract
Receptor activator of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) ligand
(RANKL) has emerged as a major mediator of bone resorption,
commonly associated with cancer and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Inhibitors of RANKL signaling thus have
potential in preventing bone loss. In the present report, the
potential of zerumbone, a sesquiterpene derived from
subtropical ginger, to modulate osteoclastogenesis induced
by RANKL and breast cancer was examined. We found that
zerumbone inhibited RANKL-induced NF-KB activation in
mouse monocyte, an osteoclast precursor cell, through
inhibition of activation of IKBA kinase, IKBA phosphorylation, and IKBA degradation. Zerumbone also suppressed
RANKL-induced differentiation of these cells to osteoclasts.
This sesquiterpene also inhibited the osteoclast formation
induced by human breast tumor cells and by multiple
myeloma cells. Finally, we examined whether zerumbone
could prevent human breast cancer–induced bone loss in
animals. We found that zerumbone decreased osteolysis in a
dose-dependent manner in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer tumorbearing athymic nude mice. These results indicate that
zerumbone is an effective blocker of RANKL-induced NF-KB
activation and of osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and
tumor cells, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent for
osteoporosis and cancer-associated bone loss. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Bone remodeling is controlled by the balance between bone
formation and resorption (1). Many bone-related diseases, such as
osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Paget’s disease, and cancerinduced osteolysis, are characterized by excessive bone resorption
by osteoclast, multinucleated cells derived from hematopoietic
cells (1). The differentiation of osteoclast precursors to osteoclast is
regulated by the bone microenvironment, which includes stromal
cells, osteoblasts, and other local factors (2). Perhaps two most
proteins crucial for osteoclast differentiation and activation are
receptor activator of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB; RANK) and its
ligand, RANKL. The latter is a member of the tumor necrosis factor

(TNF) superfamily of cytokines (3), and its expression is regulated
by several factors that regulate bone resorption, including vitamin
D3, glucocorticoids, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and TNFa (2, 4, 5). The
significance of RANK-RANKL pathway is supported by studies that
show that disruption in either rank or rankl in mice produced
severe osteopetrosis and defective tooth eruption resulting from a
complete lack of osteoclasts (6). In contrast, genetic deletion of
osteoprotegerin, a decoy receptor for RANKL and an inhibitor of
RANK, produced osteoporosis resulting from an increased number
of osteoclast (7).
Bone metastases represent a common cause of morbidity in
patients with many types of cancer, occurring in up to 70% of
patients with advanced breast or prostate cancer and in about 15%
to 30% of patients with lung, colon, kidney, thyroid, and stomach
carcinoma (8). Bone metastases can cause hypercalcemia, bone
fragility, pathologic fractures, and spinal compression and are
usually associated with severe bone pain due to osteolysis, which
can be intractable (9). Besides solid tumors, osteolysis is present in
other pathologies, such as psoriatic arthritis, periodontal disease,
and multiple myeloma (10–12).
Above description thus indicates that agents that can suppress
RANKL signaling have potential for treatment of osteoporosis. In
the present report, we investigated whether zerumbone, a
sesquiterpene derived from tropical ginger Zingiber zerumbet,
can modulate RANKL-induced signaling and osteoclastogenesis.
Zerumbone has been shown to suppress azoxymethane-induced
rat aberrant crypt foci (13), inhibit dextran sodium sulfate–
induced colitis in mice (14), suppress skin tumor initiation and
promotion in mice (15), inhibit tumor growth in mice (16), and
reduce cholecystokinin-induced pancreatitis in rats (17). Previously, we have shown that this agent can down-regulate NF-nB
activation induced by various carcinogens and inflammatory
agents and suppress NF-nB–regulated gene products (18). The
current report is based on the hypothesis that zerumbone would
also suppress RANKL signaling and RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. We found that zerumbone can suppress RANKL-induced
NF-nB activation through inhibition of InBa kinase (IKK) and
inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by RANKL and by breast
cancer and multiple myeloma cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Zerumbone (Fig. 1A), isolated as described (19), was prepared
as a 50 mmol/L solution in DMSO and then further diluted in cell culture
medium. DMEM/F12, RPMI 1640, DMEM, fetal bovine serum, 0.4% trypan
blue vital stain, and antibiotic-antimycotic mixture were obtained from
Invitrogen. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies to InBa were purchased from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Antibody against phospho-InBa (Ser32/36) was
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology. Anti-IKKa and anti-IKKh
antibodies were kindly provided by Imgenex. Goat anti-rabbit and goat

1. The cell viability (C.V. ) was determined by the trypan blue exclusion assay.

anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugates were purchased from BioRad. Antibody against h-actin and leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (387-A)
for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Protein A/G-agarose beads were obtained from Pierce.
[g-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Pharmaceuticals.
Cell lines. RAW 264.7 (mouse macrophage), MDA-MB-231 (human
breast adenocarcinoma), and U266 cells (human multiple myeloma) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. RAW 264.7 cells were
cultured in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and
antibiotics. This cell line is a well-established osteoclastogenic cell system
that has been shown to express RANK and differentiate into functional
TRAP-positive osteoclasts when cultured with soluble RANKL (20).
Moreover, RANKL has been shown to activate NF-nB in RAW 264.7 cells
(21). MDA-MB-231 cells in DMEM and U266 cells were cultured in RPMI
1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum.
Electrophoretic mobility shift assays for NF-KB. Nuclear extracts were
prepared as described previously (22). Briefly, nuclear extracts from RANKLtreated cells were incubated with 32P-end-labeled 45-mer double-stranded
NF-nB oligonucleotide (15 Ag protein with 16 fmol DNA) from the HIV long

terminal repeat, 5¶-TTGTTACAAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCAGGGGGAGGCGTGG-3¶ (boldface indicates NF-nB–binding sites), for 30 min at
37jC, and the DNA-protein complex formed was separated from free
oligonucleotide on 6.6% native polyacrylamide gels. The dried gels were
visualized with a Storm820 and radioactive bands were quantified using
ImageQuant software (Amersham).
Western blot analysis. To determine the levels of protein expression in
the cytoplasm or nucleus, we prepared extracts (22) and fractionated them
by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blotted with each antibody, and
detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare).
Reverse transcription-PCR analysis. RANKL mRNA expression was
determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR). MDA-MB-231 cells were
treated with zerumbone for 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from cells using
Trizol (Invitrogen). One microgram of total RNA was converted to cDNA by
SuperScript reverse transcriptase and then amplified by Platinum Taq
polymerase using SuperScript One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen). The
primers include those for RANKL ( forward primer, 5¶-CGTTGGATCACAGCACATCAG-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-AGTATGTTGCATCCTGATCCG-3¶) and
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; forward primer,
5¶-GTCTTCACCACCATGGAG-3¶; reverse primer, 5¶-CCACCCTGTTGCTGTAGC-3¶). Cycling conditions were 30-s denaturation at 94jC, 30-s annealing
at 56jC, and 30-s elongation at 72jC for 35 cycles. PCR products were
electrophoresed on 2% agarose gels and gel images were visualized under
UV light and photographed.
Trypan blue exclusion assay. Cells were harvested from the 24-well
plates by treatment with 0.2% trypsin-EDTA, centrifuged, and suspended
with 1 mL culture medium. Cell suspension was mixed with equal volume of
0.4% isotonic trypan blue solution. Total cell number and fraction of
nonviable, dye-accumulating cells were counted after 2 min in FuchsRosenthal hemocytometer under light microscope.
IKK assay. To determine the effect of zerumbone on RANKL-induced
IKK activation, IKK assay was done by a method described previously (22).
Briefly, the IKK complex from whole-cell extracts (800 Ag protein) was
precipitated with antibody against IKKa followed by treatment with protein
A/G-agarose beads. After 2 h of incubation, the beads were washed with
lysis buffer and assayed in a kinase assay mixture containing 50 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.4), 20 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L DTT, 20 mCi [g-32P]ATP,
10 mmol/L unlabeled ATP, and 2 Ag substrate glutathione S-transferase
(GST)-InBa (amino acids 1–54). After incubation at 30jC for 30 min, the
reaction was terminated by boiling with SDS sample buffer for 5 min.
Finally, the protein was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, the gel was dried, and
the radioactive bands were visualized with a PhosphorImager. To determine
the total amounts of IKKa and IKKh in each sample, the whole-cell protein
was resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a nitrocellulose
membrane, and blotted with anti-IKKa or anti-IKKh antibody.
Osteoclast differentiation assay. RAW 264.7 cells were cultured in
24-well dishes at a density of 5  103 per well and allowed to adhere
overnight. The medium was then replaced, and the cells were treated with
5 nmol/L RANKL for 5 d. All cell lines were subjected to TRAP staining
using leukocyte acid phosphatase kit (387-A).
In vivo osteolytic bone metastasis assay. The estrogen-independent
human breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 was cultured and resuspended
in PBS to give a final concentration of l  105/100 AL, which was injected
directly into the left ventricle of 4- to 5-wk-old female BALB/c nu/nu mice
(Harlan) via a percutaneous approach. The mice were then randomly
assigned to one of three groups (n z 9/group), treated with vehicle (0.9%
sodium chloride) or zerumbone (20 or 100 mg/kg body weight in vehicle) by
i.p. injection three times a week for 28 d, and then sacrificed. Radiographs
(Faxitron radiographic inspection unit, Kodak) were obtained at baseline
and just before sacrifice. Area of osteolytic bone metastases on X-rays of
tibiae and femorae, recognized as well-circumscribed radiolucent lesions
on radiographs, was quantitated using MetaMorph imaging software
(Molecular Devices). Radiographs were analyzed by investigators blinded
to the composition of the groups in the experiment or the experimental
protocol and areal data for each group are presented as mm2/lesion
(mean F SE).

Zerumbone Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis Induced by RANKL
Immunohistochemistry. Bone histology and histomorphometric analysis of bone tissue sections were performed as previously described with
minor modifications (23). Briefly, on day 28 after tumor cell inoculation,
animals treated with vehicle or zerumbone were sacrificed; both hind limbs
from each animal were harvested, fixed in 10% formalin, decalcified in
EDTA, and embedded in paraffin; and 4- to 5-Am-thick sections of
undecalcified long bones were cut with a Leica microtome. Sections were
stained with H&E, orange G, and phloxine. Histomorphometric analysis for
tumor burden was performed on H&E-stained sections of tibiae using the
MetaMorph computerized image analysis system. Tumor burden is
expressed as a percentage of the total area of medullary cavity (between
the cortices and a fixed distance from the growth plate) that is occupied by
tumor. Osteoclasts were detected in situ in serial sections as previously
described by cytochemical staining for TRAP activity, a marker of
osteoclasts (23).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SE and analyzed
using StatView software (version 5.0; SAS Institute, Inc.). Statistical
significance of differences was assessed using the nonparametric MannWhitney U test. Values of P V 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Zerumbone inhibits RANKL-induced IKK activation. Because zerumbone inhibits the phosphorylation and degradation
of InBa, we next checked whether zerumbone alters the activity
or the levels of IKK, which leads to InBa phosphorylation.
Immunocomplex kinase assay on cells treated with RANKL
showed a sharp increase in IKK activity as indicated by the
phosphorylation of GST-InBa within 3 minutes. In contrast, cells
pretreated with zerumbone could not phosphorylate GST-InBa
on RANKL treatment (Fig. 2C, top). To check whether the
apparent loss of IKK activity was due to the loss of IKK protein
expression, the levels of the IKK subunits IKKa and IKKh were
tested by Western blot analysis. Results in Fig. 2C clearly show
that zerumbone treatment did not alter the expression of IKKa
and IKKh.

Results
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of
zerumbone on RANKL signaling that leads to osteoclastogenesis.
Whether zerumbone could modulate osteoclastogenesis induced
by tumor cells was another focus of these studies. We used the
RAW 264.7 cell (murine macrophage) system, as it is a wellestablished model for osteoclastogenesis (24).
Zerumbone abrogates RANKL-induced NF-KB activation. To
investigate whether zerumbone modulates RANKL-induced NF-nB
activation in RAW 264.7 cells, cells were either pretreated with
zerumbone for 12 hours or left untreated and then exposed to
RANKL for indicated times, nuclear extracts were prepared, and
NF-nB activation was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. As shown in Fig. 1B, RANKL activated NF-nB in a timedependent manner; however, zerumbone completely abrogated
RANKL-induced NF-nB activation (Fig. 1B).
To determine the minimum concentration of zerumbone
required to suppress RANKL-induced NF-nB activation, cells were
pretreated with various concentrations of zerumbone and then
exposed to RANKL. Zerumbone almost completely suppressed
NF-nB activation at 20 Amol/L (Fig. 1C). Treatment of cells with
20 Amol/L zerumbone for 12 hours had no effect on cell viability as
determined by the trypan blue exclusion method.
Zerumbone inhibits RANKL-induced IKBA phosphorylation
and degradation. Most cytokines activate NF-nB through
phosphorylation and degradation of its inhibitory subunit InBa
(25). To identify the mechanism involved in the inhibition of NF-nB
activation by zerumbone, we first checked the effect on zerumbone
on level of InBa by using Western blot analysis. In cells treated with
RANKL, the InBa level dropped within 5 minutes and returned to
normal level within 60 minutes (Fig. 2A, left). In contrast, cells
pretreated with zerumbone showed suppressed RANKL-induced
degradation of InBa (Fig. 2A, right).
Next, we investigated the effect of zerumbone on the
phosphorylation of InBa, which occurs before its ubiquitination
and degradation (25). We used the proteasome inhibitor N-acetylleu-leu-norleucinal (ALLN) to prevent RANKL-induced InBa
degradation. Western blot analysis for phospho-InBa in Fig. 2B
clearly indicates that RANKL induced InBa phosphorylation in
RAW 264.7 cells and that zerumbone abrogated this effect.
Zerumbone alone did not result in phosphorylation of InBa.

nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot analysis was performed with anti-InBa.

(10 nmol/L) for 15 min. Cytoplasmic extracts were prepared, fractionated by 10%
SDS-PAGE, and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Western blot
analysis was performed using either anti-phospho-InBa (top ) or anti-InBa
(bottom ). C, RAW 264.7 cells (3  106) were pretreated with zerumbone

were immunoprecipitated using antibody against IKKa and analyzed by an
immune complex kinase assay using recombinant GST-InBa as described in
Materials and Methods. To examine the effect of zerumbone on the level of IKK
proteins, whole-cell extracts were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and
examined by Western blot analysis using anti-IKKa (middle ) and anti-IKKh
(bottom ) antibodies.

Zerumbone inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis.
Next, the effect of zerumbone on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis was examined. RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with
different concentrations of zerumbone in the presence of RANKL
and allowed to differentiate into osteoclasts. As shown in Fig. 3A,
RANKL induced osteoclasts in the absence of zerumbone at day 4.
By contrast, the differentiation into osteoclast was significantly
decreased in the presence of zerumbone. In addition, the formation
of osteoclast decreased with increasing concentration of zerumbone (Fig. 3B). As little as 0.5 Amol/L zerumbone had a significant
effect on RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. Under these
conditions, the viability of cells was not significantly affected
(Supplementary Fig. S1).
Zerumbone acts at an early step in the pathway leading to
RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. It normally takes up to
5 days for RAW 264.7 cells to differentiate into osteoclasts in
response to RANKL. To elucidate how early zerumbone acts in this
pathway, RAW 264.7 cells were treated initially with RANKL,
zerumbone was added 1, 2, 3, and 4 days after RANKL addition, and
then its effect on osteoclast formation was determined. Zerumbone
inhibited osteoclastogenesis even when the cells were exposed

24 hours after the RANKL treatment. However, the inhibitory effect
decreased significantly in a time-dependent manner when cells
were treated with zerumbone after RANKL treatment (Fig. 4).
Zerumbone inhibits osteoclastogenesis induced by tumor
cells. Osteoclastogenesis is commonly linked with breast cancer
(26) and multiple myeloma (27) through the activation of NF-nB
(28). Whether zerumbone also inhibits tumor cell–induced
osteoclastogenesis of RAW 264.7 cells was investigated. As shown
in Fig. 5A and B, incubating RAW 264.7 cells with breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 cells or multiple myeloma U266 induced osteoclast
differentiation, and zerumbone suppressed this differentiation.
These results indicate that osteoclastogenesis induced by tumor
cells is significantly suppressed by the presence of zerumbone.
Whether human breast cancer or multiple myeloma cells express
RANKL was examined by RT-PCR. We found that human multiple
myeloma U266 cells do express RANKL but human breast cancer
cells (MDA-MB-231) do not (Fig. 5C).
Zerumbone decreases osteolysis in MDA-MB-231 breast
cancer tumor-bearing mice. To determine the effect of
zerumbone on bone loss, we used a xenotransplant mouse model.
Human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) were injected directly

Zerumbone Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis Induced by RANKL

Overall tumor burden in tibiae assessed histomorphometrically
was statistically not significantly different between the tumorbearing (Fig. 6D, a, 54 F 9%, n = 15) and zerumbone-treated groups
(Fig. 6D, b, 49 F 9%, n = 17). However, TRAP activity shows intense
osteoclast activity with tumor-bearing mice at tumor-bone
interface (Fig. 6D, c, pink/red staining ) and also at some distance
away from the tumor around the growth plate. In contrast,
osteoclast activity is markedly reduced in zerumbone-treated
groups (Fig. 6D, d). In vehicle-treated tumor-bearing animals, the
osteoclasts presented at the tumor-bone interface along the
cortico-endosteal surface where they are rarely seen (Fig. 6D, e).
In contrast, there are no osteoclasts present at the corticoendosteal surface despite the tumor cells being in contact with
bone and the comparable amounts of tumor in the two groups of
tumor-bearing animals (Fig. 6D, f ). These results indicate that
zerumbone significantly suppressed the osteolysis in tumorbearing mice.

Discussion

Figure 4. Zerumbone inhibits RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis 24 h after
stimulation. RAW 264.7 cells (5  103) were incubated with RANKL (5 nmol/L)
and zerumbone (2 Amol/L) for indicated times. A, cells were cultured for 5 d after
RANKL treatment and stained for TRAP expression. B, multinucleated
osteoclasts (i.e., those containing three nuclei) were counted. C , cells treated
with medium alone (control).

into the left ventricle. At day 28, osteolytic bone metastases were
detectable by radiography in the majority of the animals in
different groups. As shown in Fig. 6A, there was no significant
difference in body weight between control tumor-bearing mice and
zerumbone-administrated groups. This result indicates that
zerumbone is nontoxic even at the higher dose (100 mg/kg).
The data presented in Fig. 6B showed that zerumbone (20 and
100 mg/kg) suppressed osteolytic bone metastases compared with
vehicle-treated human breast tumor-bearing mice. The effect was
more pronounced at 100 mg/kg than at 20 mg/kg dose of
zerumbone. Therefore, as indicated in Fig. 6C, human breast cancer
induced osteolysis (represented by radiolucency) and the destruction of cortices (arrows) in bone of tumor-bearing mice (left). In
contrast, there was very little osteolysis in bone from the higher
dose zerumbone (100 mg/kg)–treated groups and the cortices
remained intact (right).

Bone loss is one of the major problems associated with aging,
arthritis, cancer, and other chronic inflammatory illnesses.
Identification of inhibitors of bone loss that are safe, efficacious,
and affordable is needed. Zerumbone is one such compound that is
derived from shampoo ginger and has been shown to suppress
inflammatory pathways. The goal of this study was to investigate
the effect of zerumbone, a bioactive sesquiterpene, on RANKLinduced NF-nB activation and osteoclastogenesis induced by both
RANKL and tumor cells.
Our results indicated that RANKL activated NF-nB in osteoclast
precursor cells through the activation of IKK and subsequent InBa
phosphorylation and degradation. The RANKL-induced NF-nB
activation signaling pathway differs from that of the TNF-induced
pathway. For instance, NIK, which may function as an activator of
IKKa, is necessary in RANKL-induced NF-nB activation (21);
however, it is dispensable for TNF-induced NF-nB activation (29).
Therefore, Novack and colleagues (30) reported that NIK-deficient
osteoclast precursors did not respond to RANKL in an in vitro
differentiation system devoid of osteoblasts. We also found that
zerumbone inhibited RANKL-induced IKK activation, leading to
the suppression of NF-nB activation.
A recent study established that IKKh, but not IKKa, is essential
for inflammation-induced bone loss and is required for osteoclastogenesis in vivo (31). Although the ability of zerumbone to suppress
TNF-induced IKK activation has been reported (18), the current
study is the first to report that zerumbone can suppress RANKLinduced IKK activation and consequently NF-nB activation. How
zerumbone inhibits RANKL-induced IKK activation is not clear.
Numerous kinases have been implicated in the activation of IKK,
including AKT, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase kinase 1, 2, and 3, glycogen
synthase kinase-3h, and NIK (32). Previously, our group has shown
that NIK-induced NF-nB activation is blocked by zerumbone (18).
Thus, it is possible that zerumbone inhibits RANKL-induced IKK
activation through inhibition of NIK. However, other potential
mechanisms cannot be ruled out based on the data presented here.
Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on RANKL under physiologic
and pathologic conditions (1, 2). Although the mechanism by
which RANKL induces osteoclastogenesis is not completely
understood, it is known that RANKL-induced activation of NF-nB
and MAPK pathways as well as up-regulation of NFAT2 expression
are required for osteoclastogenesis (33). The importance of NF-nB

in osteoclastogenesis is suggested by using gene deletion models.
The mice lacking both NF-nB p50 and p52 or mice deficient in
IKKh exhibit severe osteopetrosis caused by failure of osteoclast formation (33, 34). Abu-Amer and colleagues (35) reported
that InB supersuppressor blocked osteoclast differentiation and
activation. Moreover, the same group reported that the dominantnegative InB protein, which lacks the NH2-terminal phosphorylation site, lowered NF-nB activation and reduced recruitment of
osteoclasts to bone erosion (36). Furthermore, IKK inhibitory
peptide can suppress osteoclastogenesis and bone loss in a mouse
model of arthritis (31). Thus, it is reasonable to suggest that
zerumbone suppresses osteoclastogenesis through inhibition of
NF-nB activation.
Malignant tumors with the skeleton as the primary site as well as
metastatic bone lesions are considered a major health problem,
affecting over 350,000 patients in the United States annually.
Among them, 70% to 95% of patients with multiple myeloma and
up to 75% of patients with advanced breast cancer or prostate

cancer develop bone metastasis (37, 38). Osteoclast-mediated bone
destruction is a major complication in metastatic breast cancer
and multiple myeloma. In the present study, we showed that
zerumbone inhibited the osteoclastogenesis induced by breast
cancer and by multiple myeloma cells. Both breast cancer and
multiple myeloma cells are known to express RANKL (27, 39) and
to exhibit constitutive NF-nB activation (40, 41), thus implicating
them in the induction of osteoclastogenesis via the expression of
RANKL. We also found that breast cancer–induced bone loss in
mice could be inhibited by zerumbone. Consequently, our results
suggest that zerumbone could be used in the treatment of cancerinduced bone lesions. Bisphosphonate drugs (BP), potent inhibitors
of osteoclast formation and activity, are the current standard of
care and are most widely used drugs for treatment of cancerinduced osteolytic diseases. Their efficacy in abating pain and
prolonging time to significant skeletal complications has been
shown in the treatment of breast cancer–induced bone diseases
(42). However, there is increasing recognition of the increased risk

incubated in the presence of MDA-MB-231 cells
(1  103; A ) or U266 cells (1  103; B ) for 24 h, then
exposed to zerumbone (2 Amol/L) for 5 d, and
finally stained for TRAP expression. Multinucleated
osteoclasts (i.e., those containing three nuclei) in
cocultures were counted. C, MDA-MB-231
cells (0.5  106) were incubated with indicated
concentration of zerumbone for 24 h and isolated total
RNA and examined for expression of RANKL using
RT-PCR. U266 cells were used as a positive control for
RANKL expression. GAPDH was used as an internal
control to show equal RNA loading.

Zerumbone Inhibits Osteoclastogenesis Induced by RANKL

of severe osteonecrosis of the jaw in cancer patients receiving BPs
(43–45) with devastating consequences for affected patients (46).
Thus, it is therefore prudent to develop other antiresorptive
strategies to combat lytic bone lesions in patients with metastatic
cancer, including breast cancer metastases. At present, a fully
humanized monoclonal neutralizing antibody to RANKL, denosumab (Amgen), is ongoing in clinical trials with multiple myeloma
and breast cancer and recent data suggest that it is efficacious (47).
Zerumbone is derived from a tropical ginger and thus should
have minimum toxicity, as it is used routinely for traditional
medicine. It could be safely used in treatment of secondary bone
lesions associated with various cancers (31, 48, 49), including breast
cancer, and those associated with other diseases, such as
osteoporosis, Paget’s disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Zerumbone
suppresses osteoclast formation in vitro in a RANKL-dependent
manner as shown in this article. We also found that this
sesquiterpene is remarkably well tolerated with no toxicity effects
on systemic administration to mice at 100 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks.
In comparison with BPs or denosumab, ginger is very inexpensive
and thus likely to have a superior cost-benefit ratio. Because
humans consume large amounts of ginger regularly in certain parts
of the world with no untoward effects, these properties of

zerumbone suggest potential utility of the compound, at least as
adjunct therapy, in breast cancer patients. However, there are
currently no preclinical data to inform well-designed clinical trials
and observational studies that will be needed to determine shortand long-term effects of zerumbone and to guide clinicians and
patient on its use during breast cancer treatment. The data
reported in this article thus provide rationale for extensive
preclinical studies on zerumbone in breast cancer.
