Abstract
Numerous mechanism-based anticancer drugs that target the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway
are in clinical trials. However, it remains challenging to assess responses by traditional imaging methods. Here,
we show for the first time the efficacy of hyperpolarized 13C magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in detecting the effect of PI3K inhibition by monitoring hyperpolarized [1-13C]lactate levels produced from hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate through lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity. In GS-2 glioblastoma cells, PI3K
inhibition by LY294002 or everolimus caused hyperpolarized lactate to drop to 42 ± 12% and to 76 ± 5%, respectively. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, hyperpolarized lactate dropped to 71 ± 15% after treatment
with LY294002. These reductions were correlated with reductions in LDH activity to 48 ± 4%, 63 ± 4%, and 69 ±
12%, respectively, and were associated with a drop in levels of LDHA mRNA and LDHA and hypoxia-inducible
factor-1α proteins. Supporting these findings, tumor growth inhibition achieved by everolimus in murine GS-2
xenografts was associated with a drop in the hyperpolarized lactate-to-pyruvate ratio detected by in vivo MRS
imaging, whereas an increase in this ratio occurred with tumor growth in control animals. Taken together, our
findings illustrate the application of hyperpolarized 13C MRS of pyruvate to monitor alterations in LDHA activity and expression caused by PI3K pathway inhibition, showing the potential of this method for noninvasive
imaging of drug target modulation. Cancer Res; 70(4); 1296–305. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays an
integral role in the regulation of many key cellular processes,
mediating proliferation, differentiation, intracellular signaling, and glucose metabolism (1). Constitutive signaling
through deregulation of the pathway is common in human
cancers and drives tumor development by inducing angiogenesis, motility, invasion, progression, and survival (2).
The PI3K pathway is one of the most frequently activated,
with current estimates indicating that mutations in at least
one of the pathway components account for up to 30% of all
sporadic human cancers (3, 4). Given the importance of this
signaling pathway in oncogenesis, it provides an attractive
target for mechanism-based anticancer treatments (5, 6). Accordingly, several PI3K inhibitors are currently in clinical

trials with promising results in glioblastoma, breast, hematologic, and non–small cell lung cancer studies (7).
Response to PI3K inhibition is often associated with tumor
stasis rather than shrinkage (8, 9). Consequently, the utility of
such traditional imaging methods as computed tomography
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in monitoring early
response is limited. Current clinical trials resort to either indirect methods, such as inspection of peripheral blood
mononuclear cells for drug-induced molecular effects, or
highly invasive methods, such as monitoring of sequential tumor biopsies (10, 11). For this reason, identifying novel biomarkers of target inhibition that are detectable by noninvasive
methods is essential for determining the efficacy of treatment
and correlation with antitumor effects (7, 12).
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a noninvasive,
radiation-free method that has been valuable for informing
on biochemical composition of cancer cells and providing
metabolic imaging biomarkers of cell transformation and response to treatment (13–18). We have used MRS to identify
biomarkers of response to emerging targeted therapies (19–23).
In particular, we have shown that inhibition of the PI3K pathway by LY294002 or wortmannin is associated in cells with a
drop in phosphocholine (PC; ref. 22). Consistent with this finding, in vivo treatment with the bioavailable wortmannin analogue PX-866 resulted in a drop in choline-containing
metabolites in an orthotopic brain tumor model (23).

C MRS methods can also be used to inform on cellular
metabolism, but application has been limited due to low sensitivity. However, recent advances in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) and its application to solution-state MR
provide a signal enhancement of >10,000-fold compared with
conventional 13C MRS (24). The dramatically improved signal-to-noise ratio has enabled the real-time investigation of
previously unexplored metabolic reactions (25–29). In particular, this method has been used to monitor pyruvate metabolism
in vivo and in cells to show an increase in pyruvate-to-lactate
conversion in cancer, consistent with the increase in LDH activity (25, 29). In a prostate cancer model, elevated hyperpolarized lactate and an increase in the ratio of hyperpolarized
lactate to total hyperpolarized carbon species were associated
with histologic grade (29). In other studies, a drop in hyperpolarized lactate formation was observed following chemotherapeutic treatment, a result of the apoptotically induced
depletion of NADH, the cofactor of LDH (27).
Hyperpolarized 13C MRS of pyruvate has unrealized potential for monitoring therapies specifically targeted at key carcinogenic pathways. The modulation of energy production
and its interplay with altered cell signaling has received substantial attention in recent years (30, 31) and it is clear that
PI3K signaling has direct effects on glucose metabolism (32).
Several putative interactions exist but it is likely that the predominant link is through mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR)–activated posttranscriptional control of hypoxiainducible factor-1 (HIF-1; refs. 33–35), which controls the expression of several glycolytic enzymes, including the LDH
subunit LDHA (32, 36, 37). Based on this knowledge, we hypothesized that PI3K signaling would directly affect cellular
LDH activity and that this could be monitored using hyperpolarized 13C MRS by observing the formation of hyperpolarized lactate from introduced hyperpolarized pyruvate.
Treatment with a PI3K inhibitor would negatively modulate
hyperpolarized lactate formation. Hyperpolarized lactate
would thus provide a biomarker of PI3K signaling inhibition.
To test this hypothesis, we investigated two cancer cell
lines treated with inhibitors of PI3K signaling. We observed
that signal inhibition resulted in a significant reduction in
hyperpolarized lactate and show that this reduction is due
to partial silencing of HIF-1–regulated expression of LDHA
and a resulting drop in LDH activity. Our results indicate,
to our knowledge for the first time, that hyperpolarized 13C
MRS could be used to monitor PI3K signal inhibition and
thus can address the need for a noninvasive approach to
monitor the efficacy of PI3K-targeted drug treatments.

firmed in association with their use in the experiments described here.
Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 units/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. DMEM
used for culturing of GS-2 was supplemented with an additional 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate and 28 mmol/L glucose.
Custom-made DMEM with 0.22 g/L inorganic phosphate [Pi;
University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) Cell Culture
Facility] was used in MRS studies. For all experiments, cells
were harvested in their logarithmic phase of proliferation.
For PI3K inhibition, cells were incubated with 50 μmol/L
LY294002. GS-2 cells were treated for 48 h and MDA-MB-231
cells were treated for 40 h, based on previous work (22). For
mTOR inhibition, cells were treated for 48 h with 100 nmol/L
everolimus (Molcan Corp.). To monitor the effect of a DNAdamaging agent, cells were treated for 48 h with 100 μmol/L
temozolomide (Tecoland Corp.). The final concentration of
DMSO used to dissolve all inhibitors was 1:1,000 in culture
medium.
Cell proliferation assay. The effect of drug treatment on
cell proliferation was determined using the WST-1 reagent
assay (Roche). Cells were seeded in 96-well plates and treated
for 4 to 48 h. After treatment, WST-1 reagent was incubated
in wells for 2 h and cell viability was determined by quantification
of absorbance at 440 nm using a spectrophotometer (Tecan).
Perfused cell system setup. For MRS studies, cells were
encapsulated in agarose beads, essentially as described (38).
The same number of cells (1.5 × 108 to 2 × 108 for GS-2 and
7 × 107 to 8 × 107 for MDA-MB-231) was investigated in both
control and treated experiments. After encapsulation, beads
were incubated overnight in growth medium before MRS
experiments.
The beads were loaded into a nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR)–compatible perfusion system, modified as previously
described (38). Briefly, the perfusion system consisted of
three tubing lines to circulate medium to a 10-mm NMR
tube and one tubing line to deliver 5% CO2. A three-way valve
allowed for introduction of hyperpolarized material to the
inflow line. Perfusion medium (100 mL) was circulated at
1.5 mL/min throughout the MRS studies. Medium circulation
was stopped briefly during injection of hyperpolarized pyruvate and acquisition of 13C spectra. The NMR probe was
maintained at 35°C.
31
P MRS acquisition and analysis. 31P MRS spectra were
acquired on a 500-MHz INOVA spectrometer (Varian) using
a pulse-acquire scheme [30° pulse, 3-s repetition time (TR)]
and composite pulse 1H decoupling during acquisition. The
resulting spectra were analyzed using ACD/Spec Manager
version 9.15 (Advanced Chemistry Development). Metabolite
concentrations were calculated from peak areas determined
by deconvolution, with correction for saturation and normalization to both internal reference (Pi, 1.87 μmol/L) and cell number.
Hyperpolarization. Samples of [1-13C]pyruvic acid (Isotech) containing 15 mmol/L of the trityl radical OX063 (Oxford
Instruments) were hyperpolarized using the Hypersense
DNP (Oxford Instruments) polarizer as described (26, 29). After 1.5 h, polarized pyruvic acid was rapidly dissolved in

6.0 mL of isotonic 40 mmol/L Tris-based buffer containing
3.0 μmol/L EDTA (pH 7.8) and injected into the perfusion
system within 15 s.
13
C MRS acquisition and analysis. Single-transient 13C
spectra were acquired every 3 s for 300 s. In experiments with
GS-2 cells, 13° excitation pulses were used. Experiments with
MDA-MB-231 used 5° pulses. The intensities of lactate peaks
were quantified by integration using ACD/Spec Manager. To
correct for small variations in the degree of polarization,
peak area values of individual hyperpolarized species were
normalized to the peak area of all hyperpolarized species
at maximum value (predominantly pyruvate, occurring immediately after injection). In addition, values were normalized to cell number.
Two approaches were used to determine the effect of PI3K
inhibition on hyperpolarized lactate formation. First, maximum lactate levels per cell (Lacmax) were determined and
compared in control and treated cells exposed to the same
pyruvate concentrations. Second, the apparent pseudorate of
lactate production was determined and compared. For this,
we used Bloch equations modified for two-site chemical exchange similarly to previously described (39). Briefly, we considered the chemical equilibrium between pyruvate (Pyr) and
lactate (Lac) catalyzed by LDH (Eq. A):
kP yr

P yruvate ⇆ Lactate
kLac

ðAÞ

where kPyr and kLac are the unidirectional rate constants
of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion and lactate-to-pyruvate
conversion, respectively. After injection of hyperpolarized
[1-13C]pyruvate, the time courses of pyruvate and lactate longitudinal magnetizations, Pyrz(t) and Lacz(t), were modeled
(Eqs. B and C):
dP yrz ðtÞ
¼ P yr ðP yrz ðtÞ  P yrz1 Þ  kP yr P yrz ðtÞ

ðBÞ
dLacz ðtÞ
¼ Lac ðLacz ðtÞ  Lacz1 Þ þ kP yr P yrz ðtÞ
dt
 kLac Lacz ðtÞ

ðCÞ

where ρPyr and ρLac are the spin lattice relaxation rates [1/T1
(Pyr, Lac)], t is time, and Pyrz∞ and Lacz∞ are the equilibrium
magnetizations of Pyr and Lac, respectively. Using these
equations, the peak integrals of pyruvate and lactate versus
time were fit using a nonlinear least-squares algorithm implemented in Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc.), leading to the
estimation of kPyr, kLac, and ρPyr = ρLac. Monte Carlo simulation was also performed to assess the accuracy on the three
fitted parameters.
LDH activity. The activity of LDH was measured in cell
lysates by monitoring NADH consumption after addition of
varying concentrations of pyruvate as described (40) by monitoring absorbance at 340 nm for 10 min using an Infinite
M200 spectrophotometer (Tecan). KM and Vmax values were
then determined by fitting the initial velocity plots using a
Lineweaver-Burke plot.

Gene expression of LDHA. Total cellular RNA was extracted by RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). The quantity of total
RNA was determined using a NanoDrop ND1000 Fluorospectrometer (NanoDrop Technologies). Reverse transcription
was performed using the QuantiTect Reverse Transcription
kit (Qiagen). Real-time PCR of resulting cDNA was performed
on a Taqman 7900 (Applied Biosystems). Expression of
LDHA was examined using Assays-on-Demand (Applied Biosystems) and compared with the housekeeping gene β-actin
(Integrated DNA Technologies). All procedures were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions.
PI3K pathway protein levels. The effect of PI3K signaling
inhibition on PI3K pathway protein levels was analyzed by
Western blotting. Cytoplasmic and nuclear proteins were
run on 4% to 20% gels (Bio-Rad) by SDS-PAGE method; electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes; blocked and
incubated with primary antibodies anti–4E-BP1, anti–phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1; Ser65), anti–glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), anti–HIF-1α, antiLDHA (Cell Signaling), and anti-LDHB (Epitomics), and then
incubated with secondary antibody anti-IgG horseradish peroxidase–linked antibody (Cell Signaling). Immunocomplexes
were visualized using ECL Western Blotting Substrate
(Pierce).
NAD+/NADH assay. Concentrations of NAD+ and NADH
were measured in cell extracts using an enzyme cycling method and monitoring absorbance at 570 nm as described (41).
Animals studies. All experimental procedures were approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For tumor implantation, 4-wk-old athymic mice (nu/nu
homozygous) were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine/
xylazine (100/20 mg/kg), and GS-2 cells (∼1 × 107) were injected
s.c. in the flank. Tumor growth was monitored weekly by caliper
measurement until tumors reached ∼6 mm in diameter. From
that point, treated animals received a daily injection of everolimus (10 mg/kg/d i.p. in 20 μL), whereas control animals
were injected daily with carrier (DMSO).
In vivo MR studies were performed on a 600-MHz wide
bore vertical system (Varian). MRI was performed using a
Varian millipede 1H coil. A 20-mm home-built 13C surface
coil, positioned at the center of the magnet and of the imaging coil, was used for hyperpolarized MRS studies. Mice were
anesthetized using isoflurane (3% in O2, 1.5 L/min), and a
catheter was secured in the tail vein. Following initial knockdown of animals, anesthesia was maintained at 0.5-1.5% in
O2; 1.5 L/min throughout the imaging experiment. The tumor
region was placed in the center of the 13C coil, and the animal was positioned in the center of the magnet using a custom-built cradle. A glass tube containing 13C-enriched urea
placed at the center of the surface coil was used for position
and chemical shift reference.
Anatomic imaging was performed first to assess the positioning and size of the tumor [two-dimensional spin echo
(SE); echo time (TE)/TR = 20/2,000 ms; field of view (FOV) =
32 × 32 mm; matrix 256 × 256; slice thickness = 0.5 mm; gap =

40 mmol/L Tris, 100 mmol/L NaOH, and 0.1 mg/L Na2EDTA
were then injected via the catheter over 12 s, and 13C two-dimensional MRS imaging (MRSI) was acquired 37 s after injection, the time point when, based on nonlocalized 13C dynamic
data, the hyperpolarized 13C lactate reached a maximum as
previously described (42). The 13C two-dimensional magnetic
resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) parameters were as
follows: TE/TR = 0.195/125 ms; frequency dimension = 512;
phase dimension = 8 × 8; spectral width (SW) = 5,000 Hz;
FOV = 32 × 32 mm; Tacq = 8 s. A rectangular pulse, equivalent
to a 20° flip angle at 5 mm from the coil, was used for excitation.
Tumor volume was calculated from caliper measurements
and confirmed from SE images assuming an ellipsoid shape
(volume = 4/3.π.a.b.c). 13C two-dimensional MRSI data were
processed using jMRUI software (43). For each voxel, the amplitudes of lactate and pyruvate were quantified using the
AMARES package for MRSI and the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio
was calculated as the ratio of the amplitudes (42). From the
overlap between anatomic images and MRSI data, the voxels
representing >75% tumor were considered as tumor voxels
and the lactate-to-pyruvate ratios from these voxels were averaged.
Statistical analysis. Two-tailed unpaired Student's t test
was used to verify the statistical significance of the results,
with P ≤ 0.05 considered to be significant. All results are expressed as mean ± SD and represent an average of three repeats unless otherwise stated.

In this study, we monitored the effect of PI3K inhibition on
cellular metabolism. We first investigated the GS-2 glioblastoma cell line and then assessed the generality of our findings by investigating the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell
line and by probing GS-2 xenografts.
LY294002 leads to inhibition of signaling and cell proliferation in GS-2 cells. The effectiveness of LY294002 in
achieving suppression of signal propagation through the
PI3K pathway in treated GS-2 cells was first assessed by
probing p-4E-BP1 downstream of mTOR. Western blotting
revealed that p-4E-BP1 was substantially lower following
LY294002 treatment, confirming signaling blockage (Fig. 1A).
Consistent with inhibition of PI3K signaling, cessation of
proliferation was seen after treatment (Fig. 1B). The WST-1
cell proliferation assay showed that, after 48 hours, the number of treated cells had increased only 49 ± 10% (P = 0.01),
whereas the number of control cells increased 385 ± 84%
(P = 0.03), resulting in a significant difference between control and LY294002-treated samples (P = 0.02).

(Fig. 2B). Shortly after hyperpolarized pyruvate reaches the
cells, lactate appears as pyruvate undergoes reduction, retaining the polarized label. This results in an initial increase in lactate, after which decay of polarization is evident for both
pyruvate and lactate.
Injections resulting in a final concentration of 1.0 mmol/L
pyruvate were administered to control and LY294002-treated
cells. Conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate was
observed in both samples. However, treatment with
LY294002 caused a clear reduction in hyperpolarized lactate
levels (Fig. 3A). To quantify this drop, we determined Lacmax
in each experiment. Lacmax levels dropped in treated cells to
42 ± 7% of control (P = 0.005). To further confirm the effect of
PI3K inhibition and ascertain that our observations were not
dependent on pyruvate concentration, measurements were repeated at higher concentrations of pyruvate (2 and 3 mmol/L).
Similar results were observed (Fig. 3B) over all concentrations
and average Lacmax in treated cells was 42 ± 12% (P < 0.0001,
n = 9) of control.
To further confirm our findings, we used a two-site chemical
exchange model to fit the hyperpolarized 13 C MRS data
(Fig. 3A, continuous line) and determined the apparent pseudorate constant of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion (kPyr). Comparison of k Pyr also showed a significant reduction with
LY294002 treatment over all concentrations. Average kPyr of
treated cells was 43 ± 20% (P < 0.0001, n = 9) of control, similar
to the reduction in Lacmax. The reductions in kPyr correlated
with the reductions in Lacmax (R2 = 0.93), indicating that both
methods of analysis yield similar results (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, T1 values obtained from the fit showed that treatment
did not significantly affect the relaxation of hyperpolarized
species and therefore did not present a confounding factor
in our studies.
Modulation of metabolites by PI3K inhibitor treatment
was detected by 31P MRS. 31P spectra of control and treated
cells were acquired before and following hyperpolarized 13C
MRS to confirm cell viability during the hyperpolarized study
and to detect alterations of endogenous metabolites following PI3K inhibition. Nucleotide triphosphate (NTP) levels increased steadily over the course of all studies, indicating
sustained cell viability and confirming that exposure of cells
to hyperpolarized pyruvate did not affect cell viability or proliferation (data not shown).
31
P MR spectra (Fig. 4) also indicated that treatment with
LY294002 resulted in a significant drop in PC to 34 ± 9% of
control (P = 0.006) and phosphoethanolamine (PE) to 49 ± 7%
of control (P = 0.006). NTP levels did not change significantly
following inhibitor treatment (P = 0.6).
The drop in hyperpolarized lactate is associated with a
drop in HIF-1α levels, LDH expression, and LDH activity in
GS-2 cells. Because the conversion of pyruvate to lactate in a
cellular system could be affected by several independent processes, it was necessary to ascertain that the decrease in hyperpolarized lactate levels was indeed due to a drop in HIF-1α expression
downstream of PI3K inhibition, as hypothesized. To this end, we
determined LDH activity, LDH expression, and HIF-1α expression.
LDH activity was measured in lysates of control and treated cells over a range of pyruvate concentrations, allowing for

the determination of the kinetic parameters of the LDHcatalyzed reaction (Fig. 5A). Enzyme Vmax was 20.6 ± 1.0 μmol
NADH/min/107 cells in control cells. Following PI3K inhibition, the activity decreased significantly to 9.8 ± 0.4 μmol
NADH/min/107 cells, or 48 ± 4% of control (P = 0.008). The
drop in cellular LDH activity was, within experimental error,
the same as the drop in Lacmax observed using hyperpolarized 13C MRS. The KM values remained unchanged between
control and treated cells (P = 0.29). This suggested that the
drop in Lacmax was due to a drop in cellular LDH activity, which
was caused by a decrease in active enzyme concentration.
To confirm the drop in LDH levels, the effect of LY294002
on LDH expression was determined first by Western blotting
to assess protein levels and then by reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) to determine mRNA levels. Western blotting revealed a discernable drop in LDHA protein levels (Fig. 5B),
whereas no difference in LDHB levels was seen (data not
shown). The mRNA expression levels of LDHA also dropped
significantly to 49 ± 16% of control (P = 0.0002; Fig. 5C). Finally,
we investigated levels of HIF-1α in control and treated cells.
Consistent with HIF-1 being responsible for regulation of
LDH expression, LY294002 treatment led to decreased levels
of HIF-1α (Fig. 5B). Taken together, these data are in line with
the proposed mechanism that the drop in Lacmax was a result

13

of reduced cellular LDH activity due to lowered HIF-1α levels
following PI3K inhibition.
Additionally, it was necessary to study the effects of
LY294002 treatment on NADH, the cofactor of LDH necessary for its activity. Previous studies have shown that reduced hyperpolarized pyruvate-to-lactate flux can be caused
by depletion of the NAD(H) pool in apoptotic cells (27). However, we found that PI3K inhibition with LY294002 had no significant effect on the concentration of NADH. NADH levels
were 0.997 ± 0.137 nmol/107 cells in control cells and 0.882 ±
0.098 nmol/107 cells in treated cells (P = 0.31). The ratio of
NADH to total NAD(H) was also not significantly changed,
at 0.402 ± 0.014 in control compared with 0.335 ± 0.058 in treated cells (P = 0.18).
Control studies confirm specificity in GS-2 cells. To assess the specificity of our findings, GS-2 cells were also treated with the clinically relevant inhibitor everolimus, which
targets mTOR downstream of PI3K, and with temozolomide,
a DNA-damaging agent that is not implicated in the PI3K signaling pathway. Treatment with everolimus resulted in inhibition of signaling as evidenced by a drop in p-4E-BP1 levels
(data not shown) and inhibition in cell proliferation to 45 ±
9% of control (P = 0.001). In 13C MRS studies, Lacmax dropped
to 76 ± 5% of control (P = 0.003, n = 4), and LDH activity

showed no signal inhibition (data not shown). In line with
the unaltered signaling, hyperpolarized 13 C MRS studies
showed no change in Lac max levels (P > 0.1, n = 4) and
LDH activity assays showed no observable differences in Vmax
levels (P = 0.7).
Findings are confirmed in MDA-MB-231 cells. To assess
the generality of our findings, the effect of PI3K inhibition

was also investigated in the human breast adenocarcinoma
cell line MDA-MB-231. Similar to GS-2 cells, and as previously
reported (22), inhibition of PI3K signaling with LY294002 resulted in decreased cell proliferation and a substantial drop
in 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (data not shown).
Hyperpolarized studies were repeated in MDA-MB-231
cells, resulting in similar observations to those made in GS-2
cells. Hyperpolarized lactate levels in treated cells decreased
significantly, independent of hyperpolarized pyruvate concentration presented to the cells. On average, Lacmax dropped to

71 ± 15% of control (P = 0.001, n = 8), whereas kPyr dropped to a
comparable 63 ± 38% (P = 0.02, n = 6).
As illustrated in Fig. 5A, LDH Vmax decreased significantly
to 69 ± 12% in treated cells from 6.1 ± 0.8 μmol NADH/min/
107 cells to 4.1 ± 0.3 μmol NADH/min/107 cells (P = 0.01, n = 4).
As in GS-2 cells, the drop in LDH activity was, within experimental error, the same as the drop in Lacmax. KM remained
unchanged (P = 0.91, n = 4). Western blots revealed a drop
in LDHA as well as in HIF-1α in LY294002-treated cells compared with controls (Fig. 5B), whereas there was no apparent
effect on LDHB levels. mRNA levels dropped to 41 ± 20% of
control (Fig. 5C).

P MR spectra (data not shown) indicated that treatment
with LY294002 resulted in a decrease in PC to 80 ± 17% relative to control, although this did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.17). Similarly, there was a drop to 78% of control
in PC following treatment when a cell extract was examined,
in line with the decrease of 76 ± 4% (P = 0.002, n = 4) seen in
our previously published study.
In vivo studies show a drop in lactate-to-pyruvate ratio.
To assess the utility of hyperpolarized MRS to monitor PI3K
inhibition in vivo, we performed a small proof-of-principle
study to monitor the effect of everolimus on GS-2 tumor xenografts by probing treatment effect on the lactate-to-pyruvate ratio, as previously described (42). Figure 6 summarizes
our findings showing that tumor growth inhibition in treated
animals (n = 2, dotted lines) was associated with a drop in
lactate-to-pyruvate ratio within the tumor. In contrast, tumor growth in control animals (n = 2, continuous lines)
was associated with an increase in this ratio.

Discussion
Novel therapeutic approaches are increasingly targeting
specific molecular genetic events associated with cancer.
These advances are leading to more personalized cancer
treatment and are expected to result in improved response
and reduced toxicity. However, several challenges remain.
Most significantly, many targeted therapies result in tumor
stasis rather than shrinkage. Consequently, there is a critical
need for noninvasive functional imaging biomarkers that
confirm drug delivery and molecular drug activity at the tumor site. Here, we show, to our knowledge for the first time,
the application of hyperpolarized 13C MRS in the detection of
drug target modulation in response to treatment with inhibitors of PI3K signaling.
In this study, PI3K signal inhibition was studied in two cell
lines of different cancer types and with different genetic
backgrounds. In both cell lines, successful blockade of signaling was associated with a drop in hyperpolarized lactate levels. The drop in hyperpolarized lactate correlated with
reduced cellular LDH activity following reduction in HIF-1α
levels downstream of PI3K. Further studies are needed to
confirm our findings across a wide panel of cell lines. Nonetheless, our initial findings are promising and highlight the
potential of hyperpolarized lactate as a biomarker for monitoring the effect of inhibitors of the PI3K pathway.

C MRS Detection of PI3K Inhibition

To assess the potential of this approach for in vivo studies,
we also performed a limited proof-of-principle study in xenografts. The drop in lactate-to-pyruvate ratio following treatment was in line with the findings in treated cells and likely
indicates a drop in the conversion of hyperpolarized pyruvate
into lactate within the inhibited tumors. In contrast, the increase in the pyruvate-to-lactate ratio in control tumors is in
line with previous work monitoring tumor progression and
could be reflecting increased hypoxia and LDH expression
within the growing tumor (29). More extensive studies are
needed to assess pyruvate metabolism throughout the animal, quantify the dynamics of pyruvate-to-lactate conversion
within each voxel, and confirm the underlying biology of the
tumor and its mechanistic link to pyruvate metabolism. Nonetheless, this preliminary in vivo study shows the feasibility and
potential value of hyperpolarized 13C studies of pyruvate for
noninvasive monitoring of the effect of PI3K inhibitors.
Total lactate levels can also be monitored using 1H MRS
(44, 45). However, this approach can be of limited utility, particularly in vivo. Lactate and lipid peaks usually overlap such
that monitoring modulations in lactate can be difficult even
when methods for lipid suppression are applied. More importantly, lactate is often associated with poorly vascularized necrotic regions. In this case, the lactate is metabolically
inactive and thus would provide little information with regard to the effects of treatment.
The mechanism by which the PI3K pathway interacts with
HIF-1 has been thoroughly studied. The PI3K phosphorylation cascade regulates the eIF4F ribosomal complex that is
necessary for the translation of HIF-1α (35, 46). In addition,
several studies have shown that LY294002 has the ability to
reduce HIF-1α levels (47, 48). HIF-1 is responsible for regulating expression of LDHA and other glycolytic enzymes (31,
37). Our results are therefore consistent with these studies, as
we show that expression of HIF-1α and LDHA was affected
by inhibition of PI3K. This serves to validate our findings by
providing the mechanistic underpinnings of hyperpolarized
lactate as a biomarker of PI3K signaling.
We have previously shown that PI3K inhibition causes a
significant decrease in PC (22). Consistent with these findings, in this study, we also observed a drop in PC in both
GS-2 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Importantly, the decrease in
PC following PI3K inhibition may be explained by the same
mechanism that is controlling the modulation of hyperpolarized lactate (i.e., the drop in HIF-1α levels). The expression of choline kinase, the enzyme responsible for PC
synthesis, was recently shown to be regulated by HIF-1
(49). Accordingly, the drop in HIF-1α observed in our treated
cells is likely to lead not only to a drop in LDH expression
and hyperpolarized lactate formation but also to a drop in
choline kinase expression and thus a drop in PC. It should,
however, be noted that whereas modulation of PC was observed in this and previous work, it was more modest than
the drop in hyperpolarized lactate, required a longer acquisition time, and was more difficult to quantify due to the overlap of PC with other metabolites. This further highlights the
value of hyperpolarized lactate as a biomarker of PI3K signal
inhibition.

Hyperpolarized 13C MRS has now been extensively applied
in animal studies and the use of hyperpolarized pyruvate to
monitor tumor metabolism is entering clinical trials at our
institution. Of note, studies at lower and more clinically relevant field strengths are facilitated by the slightly longer T1 of
the carbonyl carbon (50). With this in mind, the work described here shows that hyperpolarized lactate has a promising application as a noninvasive spectroscopic imaging
biomarker of PI3K signaling, with potential to inform on drug
delivery and efficacy for a range of emerging targeted therapies in future clinical trials.
