ABSTRACT
Background: Prolonged anti-angiogenic therapy destroys tumor vasculature,
whereas vascular-normalizing doses may enhance intra-tumoral drug delivery. We
hypothesize that low-dose, short-course sunitinib normalizes vasculature, enhancing
chemotherapy efficacy.
Patients and Methods: In phase Ib, treatment-naïve breast cancer patients
received four cycles of pre-operative doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, with sunitinib
before each cycle. The optimal dose of sunitinib leading to tumor vessel normalization
on immunohistochemistry was identified. In phase II, subjects were randomized to
chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus sunitinib at the recommended phase II
dose (RP2D). Primary endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) rate. Tumor
and functional imaging biomarkers were evaluated serially.
Results: In phase Ib (n=9), sunitinib 12.5 mg daily for 7 days before each
chemotherapy was established as RP2D. In phase II, patients receiving chemotherapy
plus sunitinib (n=24) had similar pCR rates (5.0% versus 4.3%, p=1.00), but a higher
incidence of chemotherapy dose delays (33.3% versus 8.7%, p=0.04), compared to
those receiving chemotherapy alone (n=25). The addition of sunitinib to chemotherapy
significantly increased vascular normalization index (VNI) and decreased lymphatic
vessel density (D2-40) on immunohistochemistry [VNI:25.50±27.94% versus
49.29±31.84%, p=0.034; D2-40:3.29±2.70 versus 1.29±1.54, p=0.014, baseline
versus post-cycle 1], and improved perfusion on DCE-MRI (Ktrans:12.6±9.6 mL/100
g/min versus 16.3±10.7 mL/100 g/min, baseline versus post-cycle 1, p=0.015).
Conversely, immunohistochemical and DCE-MRI parameters were not significantly
altered by chemotherapy alone.

Conclusion: Low-dose, short-course sunitinib prior to anthracycline-based
chemotherapy in breast cancer patients did not improve pCR and increased
chemotherapy dose delays. However, the addition of sunitinib induced compelling
pharmacodynamic evidence of vascular normalization. Further studies with alternative
cytotoxic regimens should be explored.

adequate for IHC analysis. This demonstrated tumor vessel
destruction, with a 93% decrease in vascular normalization
index (VNI) from baseline. Furthermore, all three patients
in this cohort developed febrile neutropenia (treatmentrelated toxicities; see below). Therefore, we moved to the
next lower dose level -1 (PO sunitinib at 12.5 mg daily for
7 days) in accordance with the dose-escalation protocol.
Six patients were enrolled at this dose level. Post-sunitinib
biopsy demonstrated tumor vessel normalization in four
out of six patients (mean VNI increase from baseline:
106.8±123.4%) (Figure 1). This was therefore established
as the recommended phase II dose.

INTRODUCTION
Pathological complete response (pCR) rates remain
modest at 5-30% in unselected breast cancer populations
receiving standard-of-care anthracycline and taxanebased regimens pre-operatively [1, 2]. This therapeutic
ceiling underscores the need to increase the efficacy of
individual cytotoxic agents or to develop novel therapeutic
combinations.
Multiple studies have generally failed to
demonstrate significant benefit in adding anti-angiogenic
agents to chemotherapy in breast cancer patients [3–6].
These somewhat disappointing results may be contributed
by lack of an optimal dose schedule and the paucity of
clinically-relevant biomarkers [4]. Tumor microvessels are
structurally and functionally immature, impeding intratumoral delivery of cytotoxics. In a seminal publication,
Rakesh Jain proposed the “vascular normalization”
hypothesis, where judicious anti-angiogenic therapy
normalizes tumor vasculature and enhances cytotoxic
delivery. However, high or prolonged dosing subsequently
causes excessive pruning and blood vessel destruction,
impeding intra-tumoral chemotherapy delivery when
administered concurrently [7, 8].
We hypothesized that the administration of a doseattenuated anti-angiogenic agent prior to chemotherapy
would normalize tumor vasculature and enhance
chemotherapy delivery. We conducted a phase Ib trial
to define the optimal dose of sunitinib required to
normalize tumor vasculature on immunohistochemistry
(IHC), followed by a randomized phase II study on
clinical and pharmacodynamic effects of low-dose, shortcourse sunitinib prior to standard anthracycline-based
pre-operative chemotherapy in treatment-naïve locally
advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients.

Phase Ib: toxicities and clinical outcomes
Treatment-related toxicities are summarized (Table
2). In the 25 mg cohort (n =3), febrile neutropenia occurred
in all three patients, while dose delays and reductions
occurred in two of the three patients. The mean relative dose
intensities (RDI) of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide and
sunitinib were 90.3±8.7% and 83.3±14.4%, respectively.
Two patients achieved objective clinical response after four
cycles of chemotherapy but none achieved pCR.
In the 12.5 mg cohort (n =6), the rates of febrile
neutropenia, dose delays and dose reductions were 16.7%
each. The mean RDI of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide
and sunitinib were 96.3±9.0% and 95.8±10.2%,
respectively. All six patients achieved objective clinical
response after four cycles of chemotherapy, and of the four
patients who underwent surgery, one achieved pCR (25%).

Randomized phase II study
Twenty-five subjects were assigned to receive
chemotherapy alone, whilst 24 were assigned to receive
chemotherapy plus sunitinib (Figure 1). One patient
randomized to chemotherapy alone withdrew consent prior
to commencing treatment. Patients’ baseline characteristics
are described in Table 1. The groups were well-balanced
apart from a higher percentage of clinically node-positive
patients receiving chemotherapy plus sunitinib compared
to chemotherapy alone (80% versus 45%, p=0.02). The
majority had large primary tumors at presentation; mean
primary breast tumor size was 6.44±3.67 cm, 65.3% had
clinical T3/T4 disease and 8.2% had metastatic disease.

RESULTS
This was a single-centre study conducted between
April 2011 and November 2014. Nine patients were
enrolled in phase Ib, whilst 49 patients participated in the
phase II randomized component of the study.

Phase Ib: dose-escalation
Patients’ baseline characteristics are listed in Table 1
and dose-escalation guidelines are shown in Supplementary
Figure S2. Three patients were enrolled into the dose level
0 cohort (PO sunitinib at 25 mg daily for 7 days), but only

respectively, on the chemotherapy plus sunitinib arm.
The rates of good histological response after 1 cycle of
chemotherapy were similar in both arms (60.0% versus
46.2%, chemotherapy plus sunitinib versus chemotherapy
alone, p=0.71) [Table 3].
Serial changes in tumor microvessel and lymphatic
density on IHC were observed in the chemotherapy plus
sunitinib but not the chemotherapy alone arm (Table 4).
In the chemotherapy plus sunitinib arm, mean numbers of
α-SMA-positive cells (indicative of mature, normalized
blood vessels) and VNI were significantly increased
after one cycle of treatment compared to baseline
(5.14±4.15 versus 2.79±2.89, p=0.032; 49.29±31.84%
versus 25.50±27.94%, p=0.034, respectively). The mean
increase in VNI remained significant after four cycles
of treatment (60.86±20.05% versus 25.50±27.94%,
p=0.045). Moreover, there was a significant decline in
mean number of D2-40-positive cells after one cycle
of treatment compared to baseline (1.29±1.54 versus
3.29±2.70, p=0.014), although the difference was not
statistically significant after four cycles (p=0.085) [Table
4]. Figure 2 is a representative tumor sample in which an
increase in VNI and decrease in lymphatic vessel density
was observed after one cycle of chemotherapy plus
sunitinib. Conversely, there were no significant changes in
IHC parameters in the chemotherapy alone arm (Table 4).

Safety
Grade 3 and above non-hematologic toxicities
(stomatitis, non-neutropenic fever and lethargy)
occurred in three patients (12.5%) in the chemotherapy
plus sunitinib arm, whereas none were observed with
chemotherapy alone (p=0.23). Hematologic toxicities
were frequent but not significantly different between both
treatment arms (Table 2). Patients receiving sunitinib
experienced significantly more dose delays (33.3%
versus 8.7%, p=0.04), and had marginally lower mean
RDI of doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide (92.2%±11.0%
versus 96.7±6.4%, p=0.09), compared to those receiving
chemotherapy alone (Table 2), although the difference did
not reach statistical significance.

DISCUSSION
There is extensive preclinical data supporting the
“vascular normalization” hypothesis. Furthermore, a
correlation between vascular normalization and the clinical
64094

activity of cediranib, an oral anti-vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor agent, has been described in glioblastoma
multiforme patients [9, 10]. However, few clinical studies
have attempted to define the optimal dose of anti-angiogenic
therapy required to induce vascular normalization, and none
have investigated the strategy of delivering short-course
anti-angiogenic therapy during the presumed vascular
normalization window to enhance chemotherapy efficacy.
We therefore evaluated this novel therapeutic
strategy by adding low-dose, short-course sunitinib to
pre-operative anthracycline-based chemotherapy in breast
cancer patients. Sunitinib 12.5 mg daily for 7 days prior
to chemotherapy was established as the recommended
phase II dose based on immunohistochemical evidence
of vascular normalization in our dose-finding phase Ib
study. While the addition of sunitinib to chemotherapy
did not improve our primary endpoint of pathological
complete response rates in our randomized phase II study,
we observed definite pharmacodynamic signals that
support its biological activity. Most notably, low-dose
short-course sunitinib induced vascular normalization
on immunohistochemistry, evidenced by a statistically
significant serial increase in the vascular normalization

index in the chemotherapy plus sunitinib but not the
chemotherapy alone arm. This was accompanied
by improved vascular perfusion within the tumor
microenvironment on functional imaging in patients
receiving sunitinib.
The optimal timing of short-course anti-angiogenic
therapy in relation to chemotherapy delivery is of critical
importance in the further development of this therapeutic
strategy. Although the current literature lacks clarity on
the precise window of tumor vascular normalization,
cedirinab induced vascular normalization changes as early
as one day after initiation of treatment, whereas reversal of
these changes took place 4-6 weeks later [9, 10]. Similarly,
we observed vascular normalization changes within 7
days of sunitinib initiation and found that the maximal
histologic effect occurred by the end of the first cycle of
chemotherapy, or 4 weeks after initiation of sunitinib. This
was evidenced by a statistically significant, near-doubling
of the vascular normalization index after the first cycle of
chemotherapy compared to baseline. Although the effect
persisted with additional cycles of treatment, further

factors which may have contributed to our negative
clinical and pathological endpoints. Firstly, we observed
that the addition of sunitinib was associated with
significantly more chemotherapy dose delays in our phase
II study, leading us to hypothesize that the initiation of
sunitinib at the hematologic nadir of each chemotherapy
cycle delayed the recovery of neutrophil counts. Use of
this strategy with alternative chemotherapy regimens or
with primary prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor support is a possible consideration for future
studies. Other limitations of our study include the small
sample size, the trial being conducted only in a single
centre, and the lack of stratification according to breast
cancer subtype.
Our decision to de-escalate the dose of sunitinib
from 25 mg to 12.5 mg in the phase Ib study was based
on just one patient’s post-sunitinib tumor biopsy because
the post-sunitinib biopsy samples of the other two patients
enrolled in the same cohort were inadequate for analysis.
Conclusions may have been more robust if we had enrolled
more patients in each dose cohort or replaced patients
with inadequate biopsy samples. However, this particular
biopsy clearly demonstrated tumor vessel destruction,
and according to our dose-escalation guidelines, this
warranted enrolling subsequent patients at the next lower
dose level. Furthermore, all three patients at this dose level
developed febrile neutropenia, suggesting that the 25 mg
dose level was not tolerable and enrolling further patients
into the cohort would not have been justifiable. The next
lower dose level of 12.5 mg met the histological criteria
for evidence of vascular normalization in four out of six
patients, and was also found to be tolerable with standard
doses of chemotherapy in our dose-finding study. Since
our goal was to find the lowest dose of sunitinib that could
normalize tumor vasculature, we established sunitinib
12.5 mg for 7 days as the recommended phase II dose.
Whether an even shorter duration of sunitinib treatment
would achieve similar pharmacodynamic effects remains
an interesting question, which is best addressed through a
separate study.
In keeping with other studies evaluating the impact
of anti-angiogenic therapy on tumor vessel normalization,
we used a combination of tumor immunohistochemistry
and MRI perfusion imaging to define tumor vasculature
normalization [9, 10]. However, we do acknowledge
that these methods fail to quantify the parameter
of genuine interest – intra-tumoral cytotoxic drug
concentration. While this has been explored in animal
models, there are presently no robust or clinically
validated assays available for the determination of intratumoral drug pharmacokinetics in human subjects [18].
Immunohistochemical evaluation of tumor angiogenesis
is currently accepted as the gold standard [20], which we
used in combination with functional imaging to measure
tumor blood flow in this study to guide dose-escalation
decisions.

we hypothesize that the maximal effect of the vascular
normalization strategy occurs within 4-6 weeks of
induction anti-angiogenic therapy, making this approach
particularly relevant to shorter treatment regimens, such
as concurrent chemoradiotherapy. However, this needs
to be confirmed through the optimal scheduling of
pharmacodynamic assessments in future studies.
Interestingly, sunitinib also led to lymphatic vessel
normalization, demonstrated by a significant decline
in lymphatic vessel density (D2-40 positivity) after
1 cycle of chemotherapy. Studies have proposed that
lymphangiogenesis has an active role in cancer metastasis,
and the presence of D2-40-positive lymphovascular
invasion has an adverse effect on breast cancer survival
[11, 12]. While these preliminary findings support an
inhibitory effect of short-course anti-angiogenic agents
on tumor lymphangiogenesis, further in-vitro and in-vivo
confirmation is needed. DCE-MRI functional imaging has
been used to evaluate effects of anti-angiogenic agents in
multiple clinical trials. Ktrans describes trans-endothelial
diffusion of contrast media into the extravascular space,
and is the most widely-accepted pharmacodynamic
biomarker of anti-angiogenesis [13]. In the majority of
studies, a decline in Ktrans has been found to correlate
with drug exposure and tumor response, reflecting the
destructive effect of high-dose anti-angiogenic therapy
on tumor vasculature [14, 15]. However, an increase in
Ktranshas been reported in studies where anti-angiogenic
treatment has normalized tumor vasculature [16, 17].
In our study, the significant rise in Ktrans observed as
early as cycle 1 in patients receiving sunitinib provided
functional proof of improved vascular perfusion, which
in turn correlated positively with histological response.
Far fewer studies have proven the utility of other DCEMRI parameters (Vp, Ve, PS and F) as functional imaging
biomarkers. In a phase I study of the VEGFR TKI, ABT869, we demonstrated a correlation between drug exposure
and a decline in all of these parameters, indicating tumor
vessel destruction [15]. To what extent the increase in
these parameters observed in our current study reflects
tumor vessel normalization requires further validation.
Despite the clear evidence of vascular normalization
on immunohistochemistry and perfusion imaging, we
were unable to demonstrate the clinical benefit of adding
low-dose, short-course sunitinib to anthracycline-based
chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Signals of efficacy
were observed in patients receiving sunitinib, in particular,
the near doubling of objective clinical response rates with
corresponding improvements in histological response after
one cycle of chemotherapy. We acknowledge that neither
of these is an accepted response parameter and the lack
of statistical significance precludes firm conclusions.
However, we consider them to be noteworthy because in
contrast to all subsequent clinical and histopathological
outcome measures, cycle 1 outcomes are not biased by
chemotherapy dose delays. We have identified several

Conclusions

factor was disallowed. Primary endpoint was pCR rate,
defined as the absence of all invasive cancer in the breast
and axillary lymph nodes at the time of surgery [19].
Secondary endpoints were i) objective clinical response
rates (complete plus partial) using RECIST v1.0 criteria,
ii) axillary lymph node down-staging (conversion of
clinically-involved lymph nodes to histologically-negative
nodes at the time of surgery), iii) rates of breast conserving
surgery, iv) safety and tolerability, and v) correlation of
pharmacodynamic biomarkers [IHC and dynamic contrast
enhanced (DCE)-MRI] with clinical outcomes. Unidimensional tumor measurements for clinical response
assessment were obtained after each cycle of chemotherapy;
hematologic parameters were obtained at the start and nadir
of each chemotherapy cycle. Patients were evaluated for
surgery upon completion of four cycles of chemotherapy
or at the time of clinical tumor progression, whichever
occurred first. Post-operative therapy was in accordance
to institutional guidelines. Relapse and survival followup was performed at 3–6 monthly intervals. All
participants provided written informed consent and the
institutional ethics committee approved the study protocol
(ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01176799).

Addition of low-dose, short-course sunitinib to
standard anthracycline-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy
in breast cancer patients demonstrated compelling
pharmacodynamic effects on immunohistochemistry
and functional imaging, supporting the “vascular
normalization” hypothesis. However, sunitinib led to more
dose delays when combined with anthracycline-based
chemotherapy. We propose future studies evaluating this
treatment strategy with primary prophylactic granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor support or alternative cytotoxic
regimens.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Eligibility criteria included female patients aged
≥18 years with histologically confirmed treatment-naïve
breast cancer planned for surgery, measurable primary
tumor ≥2.0 cm, Karnofsky performance score ≥70,
absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5x109/l, platelets ≥100x109/l,
serum total bilirubin ≤1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN),
alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase
≤2.5xULN, serum creatinine ≤1.5xULN and left
ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%. Significant exclusions
were central nervous system metastases and clinically
detectable second malignancies.

Pharmacodynamic biomarkers
Immunohistochemistry (Phase Ib and II)
Serial tumor core biopsies were obtained at
baseline, ~3 weeks after cycle 1 chemotherapy, and upon
completion of four cycles of chemotherapy, or at study
withdrawal. In patients receiving sunitinib, an additional
biopsy was obtained upon completion of induction
sunitinib, prior to the initiation of cycle 1 chemotherapy.
Biopsies were obtained from primary breast tumors,
fixed in formalin and subsequently embedded in paraffin
(Supplementary Methods).
Endothelial-specific anti-CD31 antibody was
used to detect total tumor microvessel density (MVD),
whereas pericyte-specific anti-α-SMA antibody was
used to identify mature, normalized blood vessels. The
numbers of CD31-positive and α-SMA-positive vessels
in the tumor area were counted at 200x magnification.
Vascular normalization index (VNI) was defined as
the percentage of CD31-positive vessels co-expressing
α-SMA, representing the percentage of normalized tumor
blood vessels in relation to total MVD [20]. In our phase
Ib study, tumor vessel normalization was defined as ≥10%
increase in VNI from baseline; tumor vessel destruction
was defined as ≥10% decrease in VNI from baseline.
D2-40 antibody was used to detect lymphatic vessel
density; numbers of lymphatic vessels were counted at
200x magnification. The VNI, MVD and lymphatic vessel
density scores were averaged across sections [21]. Degree
of histological tumor response was graded on a five-point
scale; good histological response was defined as a score
of ≥3 [22].

Treatment plan
In phase Ib, subjects received four cycles of
pre-operative chemotherapy (3-weekly intravenous
doxorubicin 60 mg/m2 and cyclophosphamide 600 mg/
m2) with oral sunitinib prior to each cycle. We aimed to
determine the lowest dose of sunitinib required to achieve
tumor vessel normalization on the post-sunitinib biopsy
obtained on completion of induction sunitinib, prior to
the initiation of cycle 1 chemotherapy. The starting dose
was PO sunitinib 25 mg daily for 1 week prior to each
cycle of chemotherapy. Dose escalation/de-escalation
was performed in cohorts of three, with expansion to six
subjects and enrollment of sequential cohorts according
to dose-escalation guidelines (Supplementary Figure
S2). The recommended phase II dose was defined as the
dose which resulted in tumor vessel normalization in 3/3
or ≥4/6 patients of a cohort. Criteria for tumor vessel
normalization and destruction are defined in the section
Pharmacodynamic biomarkers.
In the open-label phase II study, patients were
randomized 1:1 to either four cycles of doxorubicin/
cyclophosphamide at the above-mentioned doses, or the
same chemotherapy plus sunitinib at the recommended
phase II dose. The study schema is shown in Supplementary

Lee] and WBS fund R-180-000-016-733 (T.C. Ng). The
study was approved by the National Healthcare Group
Domain-Specific Ethics Review Board.

Using a3T whole-body scanner (Magnetom Trio
Tim, Siemens AG), patients underwent DCE-MRI
scans at baseline and after one cycle of chemotherapy.
Patients receiving sunitinib had an additional scan after
induction sunitinib, prior to the initiation of cycle 1
chemotherapy. Using the Distributed Parameter (DP)
model, 3D quantitative estimate vascular parameters
including volume transfer constant between plasma
and extracellular extravascular space (Ktrans), fractional
plasma volume (Vp), fractional extravascular, extracellular
volume (Ve), vascular permeability (PS) and perfusion (F),
were acquired from DCE-MRI images (Supplementary
Methods). This model was selected because it permits
separate estimation of perfusion and permeability [23].

Statistical analysis
Statistics for phase Ib were descriptive. In phase II,
a sample size of 42 patients (21 in each arm) was required
to provide 90% power to detect an absolute difference in
pCR rates of 15% (10% with chemotherapy alone; 25%
with chemotherapy plus sunitinib), based on the selection
theory approach described by Simon et al [24]. A target
sample size of 50 was planned, taking into account an
estimated 20% attrition rate for the primary endpoint of
pCR. Chi-square test and t-test, or corresponding nonparametric tests, were used in correlative analyses of
clinical and biomarker variables. Kaplan-Meier methods
and log-rank tests were used to assess relapse-free and
overall survival. Correlations between treatment arm and
serial changes in biomarker parameters were evaluated
using paired student’s t-test. Statistical calculations were
computed using SPSS Version 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago);
p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
