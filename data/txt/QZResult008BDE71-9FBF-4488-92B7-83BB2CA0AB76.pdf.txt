Tackling Crizotinib Resistance: The Pathway from
Drug Discovery to the Pediatric Clinic
Elizabeth R. Tucker1, Laura S. Danielson1, Paolo Innocenti2, and Louis Chesler1

Abstract
Neuroblastoma is a childhood malignancy that has not yet
beneﬁtted from the rapid progress in the development of smallmolecule therapeutics for cancer. An opportunity to take advantage of pharmaceutical innovation in this area arose when the
identiﬁcation of ALK fusion proteins in non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) occurred in parallel to the discovery of point
mutations of ALK in neuroblastomas. ALK is now known to be a
marker of poor outcome in neuroblastoma, and therefore, urgent

development of speciﬁc ALK inhibitors to treat this devastating
disease is a necessity. However, the translation of small molecules
from adult directly into pediatric practice has thus far been
challenging, due to mutation-speciﬁc structural variances in the
ALK kinase domain. We discuss how the most recent structural
and biological characterizations of ALK are directing preclinical
and clinical studies of ALK inhibitors for both NSCLC and
neuroblastoma. Cancer Res; 75(14); 2770–4. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

was a milestone in the history of clinical development of smallmolecular inhibitors to treat cancer. However, resistance to crizotinib was anticipated, and between 2010 and 2013 no fewer
than 40 patent applications were received for the next generation
of ALK inhibitors. These have widely varying structural motifs,
and currently seven are in clinical trials for adult disease. Not
necessarily anticipated, however, was the variety of mechanisms
of drug resistance seen in relapsing patients (5). The ﬁrst documented crizotinib resistance mutation in NSCLC is the "gatekeeper" mutation, L1196M (Fig. 1B,i; ref. 6). However, there are
multiple additional ALK mutations that can occur in response
to crizotinib treatment, together accounting for about 30% of the
resistance cases seen in NSCLC (6, 7). This large number of
reported secondary mutations in the ALK kinase domain following crizotinib treatment poses a great challenge to those working
in the drug-discovery ﬁeld, as it is apparent that no two mutations
will result in the same sensitivity to a particular non-crizotinib
ALK inhibitor. The work done by Ceccon and colleagues (8) was
among the ﬁrst to illustrate this point through the use of ALKpositive cell lines grown in increasing concentrations of crizotinib.
Subsequently, cells acquired either a substitution at L1196, which
conferred resistance to crizotinib, but not to AP26113 and NVPTAE694, or the neuroblastoma-associated I1171N mutation,
which was resistant to all tested inhibitors.

The ALK gene is found on chromosome 2p23 and encodes a
receptor tyrosine kinase originally identiﬁed in anaplastic largecell lymphoma, where it occurs as an oncogenic fusion protein
with nucleophosmin due to the chromosomal translocation t
(2;5) (1). ALK protein consists of 1,620 amino acids with an
extracellular domain, a transmembrane sequence, and intracellular region containing juxtamembrane and kinase domains (2).
ALK came into the limelight following the discovery that in
roughly 5% of non–small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), it exists as
an oncoprotein, due to a translocation event that results in the
fusion of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4
(EML4) gene (3). In the childhood malignancy, neuroblastoma,
for which the current treatment of intermediate and high-risk
disease depends upon intensive multimodal therapy, mutations
of ALK can occur, allowing constitutive phosphorylation and
activation of downstream signaling. The differential activity of
each individual ALK mutant found in neuroblastoma impacts
upon the sensitivity of this signaling pathway to structurally
different ALK inhibitors (4). This strongly suggests that genomically stratiﬁed medicine will be crucial to improve the outcome of
this subset of children with neuroblastoma.

The Neuroblastoma Story
In 2008, a series of primary mutations in full-length ALK were
identiﬁed in neuroblastoma, the pediatric malignancy that originates in the neural crest (9–12). It is now clear that three
"hotspot" residues in the kinase domain account for 85% of
mutations (R1275, F1174, and F1245), each of which renders
ALK constitutively activated (Fig. 1B,ii; ref. 4). Substitutions at
R1275 are oncogenic drivers in the majority of familial neuroblastomas, and the results of the phase I study of crizotinib in
pediatric patients suggest that these patients will beneﬁt from
treatment with this inhibitor (9–11, 13). In contrast, the most
predominant change in sporadic neuroblastoma, F1174L, deﬁnes
relative resistance to crizotinib in the clinical setting (12, 13). The

largest cohort of neuroblastoma patients studied to date has
found that not only mutations of ALK, but also any ALK aberration, including copy-number gain or ampliﬁcation, are a marker
of worse overall survival, underlining the urgent need to evaluate
ALK inhibitors for the treatment of this group of patients (4). ALK
mutations may also be acquired upon disease relapse; therefore, it
is anticipated that even more patients could potentially beneﬁt
from therapeutic ALK inhibition (14).
The most common somatic ALK mutation, F1174L, has been
extensively characterized as a mutation that is transforming in
vitro (12), and that can accelerate the development of neuroblastoma tumors in animal models, in conjunction with
expression of the most common neuroblastoma genetic aberration, MYCN (15–17). The characterization of the signaling
pathways activated downstream of ALK in neuroblastoma has
shown that there is overlap with those described in the context
of adult ALK tumors (Fig. 1A). Important mediators of cell
proliferation and survival activated following ALK phosphorylation are the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK1/2/5 pathway, the JAK/STAT
(Janus activated kinase/signal transducer and activator of tran-

scription) pathway, the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/
Akt pathway, and the PLC (phospholipase C)-g pathway (Fig.
1A; refs. 15, 18, 19).
Following the recognition that children with aberrations of
both ALK and MYCN have an especially poor outcome, it became
a priority to understand the nature of the synergism between these
two oncoproteins. Both the zebraﬁsh and the ALKF1174L; DBHiCre
mouse models of neuroblastoma have shown that tumor development is either dependent upon or greatly enhanced with
coexpression of Mycn (16, 17). In vitro studies have also shown
that constitutively activated ALK upregulates the transcription of
Mycn (20). Our Th-ALKF1174L/MYCN transgenic model of highrisk neuroblastoma conclusively provided the in vivo evidence of a
cooperative relationship between MYCN and ALK, and further
demonstrated the downstream signaling pathways activated due
to an ALK mutation (15). It is essential to fully characterize the
complex signaling pathways maintaining cellular proliferation in
mutant ALK neuroblastoma, because if single-agent inhibition of
ALK is insufﬁcient to treat this disease, combinational therapeutic
targeting can be explored.

Therapeutic Inhibition of ALK to Treat
Neuroblastoma
Efforts to produce next-generation ALK inhibitors have been
directed toward designing molecules that target the EML4-ALK
mutant variants found in crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, including
the gatekeeper mutation, L1196M, while optimizing bioavailability. Designs that mimic the crizotinib–ALK binding elements are
popular, while alternative compounds have been identiﬁed from
high-throughput screens. Of particular note are the Novartis agent
ceritinib, now FDA approved, and the Ariad agent AP26113,
which has been granted FDA breakthrough therapy designation,
for their success in treating both crizotinib-na€ve and crizotinibresistant patients with NSCLC (21, 22). However, interrogation of
crizotinib-resistant mutations in NSCLC has found that a small
proportion of acquired mutations, including those at the F1174
residue, also exhibits resistance to ceritinib (23).
The ﬁrst clinical trial of crizotinib in pediatric patients,
although successful in demonstrating responses in a number of
patients with tumors harboring ALK aberrations, suggested that
ALK F1174L deﬁned relative resistance to this inhibitor (13). The
sensitivity of ALK F1174L to crizotinib inhibition is complex, as
cocrystallization of this inhibitor within the ALK F1174L catalytic
domain predicts an adequate ﬁt to impinge upon access to the
ATP-binding site (24), and in vitro studies demonstrate that
crizotinib can inhibit ALK F1174L, albeit at greater doses than
required for the other neuroblastoma ALK mutants, most likely
due to the increased afﬁnity of ALK F1174L for ATP (25, 26).
A mutation at F1174 is particularly intriguing, as it results in
quite a subtle change to the chemical structure of ALK, yet has a
signiﬁcant biological effect. The F1174 residue lies at the C
terminus of the aC helix within the hydrophobic spine of the
kinase domain, but distinct from the ATP-binding domain

(Fig. 1B,ii). This is in contrast to other multi-inhibitor–resistant
mutations, such as G1202R, which is found at the ATP-binding
site (Fig. 1B,i; ref. 23). The F1174L mutation, which results in the
replacement of the large phenylalanine side chain with a smaller
leucine residue, changes the geometry of the aC helix, and overall
the kinase domain of ALK adopts a catalytically active conformation (27). Moreover, the switch to a smaller residue at F1174 is
likely to have an impact on the ability of the neighboring DFG
motif to coordinate a magnesium ion, which is essential for the
kinase activity (26).
Steady-state kinetic parameters of wild-type ALK and ALK
F1174L were compared by Bresler and colleagues (26). They
found that phosphorylation of the wild-type protein leads to a
45-fold activation, and that unphosphorylated F1174L had 86%
of the activity of the phosphorylated wild-type enzyme. This
group went further to investigate the ability of neuroblastoma
ALK mutants within the kinase domain to phosphorylate a
peptide corresponding to the ALK activation loop, in order to
predict the transforming ability of individual mutants (4). Mutations at the F1174 and the F1245 residues, both within the
hydrophobic core, promoted the strongest activation of ALK,
coupled with the greatest transforming ability. Sensitivity or
resistance to crizotinib correlated with IC50 values generated using
transformation assays, rather than biochemical indices in several
cases, suggesting that a thorough biological evaluation of nextgeneration inhibitors to target individual crizotinib-resistant ALK
mutations will be required. Indeed, further experimental interrogation of the second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib has
revealed that it was unable to inhibit ALK harboring the crizotinib-resistant F1174C mutation, which would structurally have a
similar impact upon the kinase domain of ALK to F1174L (22).
The resistance of an F1174 mutation to two structurally diverse
ALK inhibitors emphasizes the urgent need to evaluate alternative

Tackling Crizotinib Resistance in Pediatrics

compounds, in order to treat patients with neuroblastoma who
are resistant to currently available ALK inhibitors. There are seven
ALK inhibitors in clinical use available to adult patients, including
those with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC (Table 1). This is in stark
contrast to only two that are in clinical trials for pediatric patients.
However, the recently reported potency of the Pﬁzer compound,
PF6463922, against F1174L in vitro clearly suggests that it could
show efﬁcacy against F1174L in vivo and warrants further investigation (28). It is clear that tackling ALK resistance will require
very careful molecularly personalized medicine, with transparent
collaborations between pharmaceutical companies, academia,
and clinicians to select the appropriate agent, or combinations,
for the speciﬁc resistant mutation or mutations acquired.

Preclinical Models of Neuroblastoma:
Predicting the Most Potent Compounds
for Clinical Use
An evaluation of next-generation ALK inhibitors to treat neuroblastoma using a rational methodology will allow selection of
the most appropriate compounds to be taken forward into the
clinic. To achieve this aim, we have developed a transgenic model
of neuroblastoma where tyrosine hydroxylase drives expression of
ALK F1174L and MYCN (Th-ALKF1174L/MYCN), serving as an
invaluable platform for the evaluation of novel therapeutics
(15). In this transgenic model, ALK F1174L expression upregulates the transcription of native Mycn, which further increases the
relevance of the model to clinical cases of neuroblastoma. Transgenic models are superior to human xenograft models for translational pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling due
to spontaneous tumor onset in an immunologically competent
animal, which allows the study of a comparable tumor microenvironment to the human disease equivalent. Indeed, through ThALKF1174L/MYCN, we were able to predict that neuroblastomas
harboring ALK F1174L would not respond to crizotinib treatment
in the clinic (13).
Despite the ongoing efforts to bring next-generation ALK inhibitors into clinical practice, it may be that some crizotinib-resistant mutants will require a combinational therapeutic approach
to achieve tumor response. We have already demonstrated tumor
regression in the Th-ALKF1174L/MYCN model when crizotinib is
combined with the mTOR inhibitor Torin2 (15). As a direct result
of this preclinical study, the combination is now being pursued

clinically in pediatrics, with a trial planned to include crizotinib
combined with temsirolimus, an agent known to be well tolerated
in the combinational therapeutic setting. Further potential for
combinational drug therapy to overcome crizotinib resistance in
dual ALK-positive, MYCN-ampliﬁed neuroblastoma might
include crizotinib with an ERK5 inhibitor, as ALK-induced transcription of MYCN and subsequent stimulation of cell proliferation requires signaling through this pathway (19).

Conclusion
Resistance to crizotinib, whether acquired, as in NSCLC, or
intrinsic, as in neuroblastoma, requires a complex clinical strategy
due to the wide range of resistance mechanisms. Preclinical
models of neuroblastoma in which there is targeted expression
of a resistant ALK mutation have a crucial role to play in the
development of next-generation ALK inhibitors. Their relevance is
not only toward the pediatric population, as results generated
with novel compounds could provide a rationale for the treatment of adult patients with multidrug-resistant ALK mutations.
Traditionally, successful drug development requires that a large
number of patients be treated to see a small effect. As genomically
personalized medicine becomes a reality, developing drugs to
treat speciﬁc molecular aberrations, a small population is targeted, but the beneﬁt will be of greater magnitude (29). This is
especially poignant for pediatric drug development, as the comparative rarity of childhood cancer to adult malignancies suggests
that pharmaceutical companies will not be incentivized to concentrate funding in this area. However, we believe in this case that
a deeper understanding of the biology of ALK mutants seen in
neuroblastoma will aid the development of ALK inhibitors to treat
both adult and pediatric disease.
