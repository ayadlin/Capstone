Abstract
Defects in antitumor immune responses have been associated
with increased release of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) as a result of
overexpression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 by tumors. In this
report, we examine the effects of PGE2 on antitumor CD8+
T-cell responses generated both by cross-presenting dendritic
cells and by direct priming by tumor cells. Our data show that
PGE2 inhibits dendritic cell maturation, resulting in the
abortive activation of naive CD8+ T cells, and is dependent
on interleukin-10 production by dendritic cells. Interaction of
tumor cells with naı̈ve CD8+ T cells in the presence of PGE2
in vitro results in the induction of CD8+ CD28 T cells, which
fail to proliferate or exhibit effector function. In vivo,
overexpression of COX-2 by tumor cells results in a decrease
in number of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells and confers the
ability of tumor cells to metastasize to the tumor draining
lymph nodes. [Cancer Res 2008;68(18):7520–9]

Introduction
Activation of naı̈ve tumor-specific CD8+ T cells occurs either
through direct interaction with metastatic tumors in the tumor
draining lymph nodes (TDLN), or indirectly via dendritic cells,
cross-presenting tumor-derived antigens to naı̈ve CD8+ T cells
within the TDLN. Deficiencies in dendritic cell recruitment and
antigen-presenting cell (APC) function have been observed in many
human cancers, resulting in reduced T-cell proliferation and
effector function (1, 2). In some cases, these defects in dendritic
cell function were associated with the release of tumor-induced
factors, including interleukin (IL)-10 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2;
refs. 3–5). IL-10 production can be up-regulated by PGE2 (6, 7) and
has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity, dampening
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses by inhibiting maturation (8), and
cytokine release (9) by dendritic cells resulting in T-cell anergy
(2, 10). Overexpression of PGE2 has been shown in many cancers
(5, 11), causing reduced number of tumor-infiltrating dendritic cells
and a reduction in their APC function (12, 13). PGE2 has been
shown to shift the profile from antitumor Th1 responses to Th2
responses, characterized by reduced IL-12 and increased IL-10
secretion by dendritic cells (14). Furthermore, PGE2 increases
tumor cell survival (15), motility (16), and angiogenesis (17), thus
allowing them to metastasize to the TDLN. Although metastasis
provides a means of direct CD8+ T-cell activation (18), migration of

COX-2–overexpressing tumors to the TDLN fails to induce
antitumor T-cell responses (19).
To investigate the effects of PGE2 on antitumor CD8+ T-cell
responses, we have adapted a murine renal cell carcinoma (Renca)
model in which the hemagglutinin antigen (HA) of influenza virus
A/PR8 H1N1 is expressed as a neo-antigen (20). RencaHA cells were
transfected with murine COX-2 cDNA (T3), resulting in the
overexpression of COX-2 and PGE2. CD8+ T-cell responses to these
tumor cell lines were investigated using transgenic CL4 CD8+
T cells expressing TCRs with high affinity for the immunodominant
KdHA-restricted epitope (21). Our data clearly show that PGE2
abrogates antitumor specific CTL responses in vivo and in vitro by
down-regulating both direct antigen presentation and crosspresentation pathways.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Six- to 8-wk-old BALB/c and BALB/c CL4 TCR transgenic mice (21)
were bred and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions at the
University of Bristol Animal Services Unit. All experiments were conducted
in accordance with the U.K. Home Office guidelines.
Cell lines. The RencaNT cell line was single cell cloned from a
population of Renca cells (22). The RencaHA (20) COX-2 (T3) cell line was
established by transfecting the RencaHA cell line. Briefly, a full-length COX-2
cDNA PCR product containing flanking NotI restriction sites was generated
using the following primers: 5¶-ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCATGCTCTTCCGAGCTGTGC-3¶ and 5¶-ATAGTTTAGCGGCCGCTCATTACAGCTCAGTTGAACGCC (the source plasmid was kindly provided by Prof. R. Dubois,
Vanderbilt University Medical Center and Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center;
Nashville, TN), and cloned into the NotI restriction site of the expression
vector pIRESpuro2 (Clontech). RencaHA cells were plated in six-well plates
before transfection. When 70% to 90% confluent, cells were incubated with
10 Ag of Midiprep DNA (Qiagen) mixed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent
(Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were then
incubated in the absence of antibiotics penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen)
and FCS (Invitrogen) for 72 h, after which cells were washed with HBSS
(Invitrogen), and grown in medium supplemented with 1 Ag/mL puromycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mg/mL geneticin (Invitrogen). Resulting colonies
were expanded and assayed for integrated COX-2 cDNA by PCR and COX-2
mRNA expression by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and for PGE2
production by ELISA. RencaNT cells were maintained in complete medium
[RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FCS, 2 mmol/L
glutamine, 50 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, and 5  10 5 mol/L 2-ME,
all obtained from Invitrogen]. RencaHA cells were grown in complete
medium supplemented with 0.1 mg/mL geneticin (Invitrogen), and T3 were
maintained in complete medium containing 0.1 mg/mL geneticin and
1 Ag/mL of puromycin (Sigma-Aldrich).
Bone marrow–derived dendritic cells. Bone marrow–derived dendritic
cells (BMDC) were generated from hematopoetic progenitor cells (23).
Briefly, bone marrow cells were harvested aseptically from the leg bones of
BALB/c mice by flushing out the lumen of the bones with complete RPMI
using a 25-gauge needle (Tyco Healthcare), in plastic Petri dishes. Cells were
filtered through a 40-Am cell strainer. Macrophages were depleted after

Effect of PGE2 on Antitumor CD8+ T-Cell Responses
3-h incubation of bone marrow cells in granulocyte macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF) medium [complete RPMI containing 10% (v/v)
GM-CSF obtained from supernatant of GM-CSF–secreting X63 hybridoma
cell line, a gift from Dr. F. Ronchese, Malaghan Institute of Medical
Research, Wellington University School of Medicine, Wellington, New
Zealand] in T75 flask at 37jC in a humidified incubator with 5% (v/v) CO2.
After 3-h incubation, the supernatant was centrifuged at 1,800 rpm for
5 min and the cells were resuspended at 2  106/mL. Two million cells per
well were cultured in 6-well plates in GM-CSF medium, for 10 d at 37jC in
a humidified incubator. The medium was changed on days 3, 6, and 7 by
replacing 2 mL of medium with fresh GM-CSF medium. Matured dendritic
cells (mDC) were generated by the addition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS;
1 Ag/mL; Escherichia coli 026:B6, Sigma-Aldrich) to the immature dendritic
cell (iDC) culture for 18 h. Where mentioned on day 7 or 9, iDC were
incubated with 1 Amol/L PGE2 (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by 1 Ag/mL LPS
(Sigma-Aldrich) on day 9. On day 10, nonadherent cells were harvested from
the wells, washed thoroughly, irradiated with 3,000 rad, and used as APC,
as described below. Where mentioned, dendritic cells were treated with
15 Ag/mL of purified anti–IL-10R monoclonal antibody (mAb; 1B1.3 clone;
ref. 24) or normal rat IgG isotype (Invitrogen) on day 9.
ELISA. The concentration of IL-10 in the supernatant of BMDC was
measured using standard ELISA protocols. Plates were coated with purified
anti–IL-10 mAb (Biosource Oxford Biosystems), blocked with 1% bovine
serum albumin in PBS, and incubated with supernatants for 2 h, followed by
biotinylated anti–IL-10 mAb (Biosource). Bound biotinylated mAb was
detected by incubation with ExtrAvidin-HRP (Sigma-Aldrich) followed by
incubation with tetramethylbenzidine substrate (Sigma-Aldrich). The
reaction was stopped with 2 mol/L H2SO4. Absorbance was read at
450 nm with a 595 nm reference. Supernatant from RencaHA and T3 tumor
cell lines were analyzed for PGE2 by ELISA, using the PGE2 EIA kit (Assay
Designs Cambridge) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
tumor cells left untreated or treated with 5 Ag/mL NS-398 [Sigma-Aldrich;
dissolved in 10% (v/v) DMSO] for 72 h were pretreated with 44 Amol/L
arachidonic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) for 45 min before the supernatant was
collected and frozen at 80jC. The number of cells for each tumor was
counted and the concentration of PGE2 obtained from ELISA was
normalized to 1  106 cells.
Enrichment of CL4 CD8+ T cells. Single-cell suspensions were
generated from CL4 TCR transgenic mice by positive selection using antiCD8 MACS beads on midiMACS (Miltenyi Biotec Bisely) and LS separation
columns, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. This routinely gave a
purity of CD8+ T cells >95% as determined by flow cytometry. In some
experiments, CL4 CD8+ T cells were labeled with 5 Amol/L CFSE (Molecular
Probes, Inc.) in accordance with described protocols (23).
In vivo proliferation assays. BALB/c mice were injected s.c. with 1 
106 RencaHA or T3 on day 0. On day 11, mice were injected i.v. with 3  106
purified, naı̈ve CFSE-labeled CL4 CD8+ T cells. For COX-2 inhibition, mice
were injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg NS-398 (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in 10%
(v/v) DMSO. The drug was administered before tumor injection and then
thrice per week for the duration of the experiment. Tumor growth was
determined on days 16 and 21 (20). Tumors were measured with calipers
and the growth was evaluated by applying the following formula (a 2  b/2),
where a is the horizontal diameter and b is the vertical diameter of the
tumor. For assessment of CL4 accumulation in the TDLN and tumor, mice
were sacrificed on days 16 and 21, respectively.
Coculture and CL4 CD8+ T-cell proliferation in vitro. CL4 CD8+ T-cell
proliferation assays were performed as described previously (23). Briefly,
1  104 naı̈ve CL4 CD8+ T cells were cocultured with 1  104 irradiated
BMDC in 96-well plates in the presence of 1 ng/mL KdHA peptide
(IYSTVASSL), at 37jC, 5% (v/v) CO2 for 72 h. For the final 8 h, cells were
pulsed with 1 ACi/well [3H]thymidine (Amersham Life Sciences Buckinghamshire). [3H]thymidine incorporation was measured using a 1450
Microbeta liquid scintillation counter with Microbeta for Windows 2.7
(Wallac-Oy). For coculture assays, 1  106 naı̈ve CFSE-labeled CL4 CD8+
T cells were cultured with 1  105 irradiated BMDC, splenocytes, or tumors
in 24-well plates. For experiments using BMDC and splenocytes, 1 ng/mL
KdHA (IYSTVASSL) peptide was added to the culture at the time of

incubation with CL4 CD8+ T cells. After 48 to 72 h at 37jC, 5% (v/v) CO2, CL4
CD8+ T cells were examined by flow cytometry for intracellular IFN-g or for
the expression of cell surface molecules. For IL-10R blocking experiments,
CL4 CD8+ T cells were cocultured with dendritic cells in the presence of
15 Ag/mL anti–IL-10R mAb (24) or rat IgG1 isotype (Invitrogen) for 72 h.
Flow cytometry. Single-cell suspensions derived from BMDC were
stained with anti-CD11c.PE mAb in the presence of supernatant from antiFcgIII mAb-secreting 2.4G2 cell line. CD11c+ cells were analyzed for cell
surface molecules using anti-H2Kd.bio, CD80.bio, CD86.bio, CD40.bio
mAbs, or isotype controls followed by SA.APC. CL4 CD8+ T cells were
stained by anti-Thy1.1.PE, CD69.bio, CD28.bio, and Ly6C.bio followed by
SA.APC. All these mAbs were purchased from BD Oxford. Dead cells were
stained with 7-amino-actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich) and gated out in the
analyses. Intracellular IFN-g and CTLA-4 expression in CL4 CD8+ T cells
were detected using the BD Perm/fix kit with Golgi plug (BD) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions and stained with anti–IFN-g.APC mAb
or anti–CTLA-4.PE (BD). The expression of all surface and intracellular
molecules except of CTLA-4 was measured after 72 h culture. Expression
of the intracellular CTLA-4 in CL4 CD8+ T cells was measured after
48 h culture. RencaHA, T3, and RencaNT cell lines were stained for HA,
using 37/38 mAb followed by goat anti-mouse IgG-FITC (Sigma-Aldrich)
secondary antibody. MHC class I expression in RencaHA and T3 cell lines
was detected by anti-H2Kd.bio mAb followed by SA.APC. Cells were
acquired on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer with CellQuest software (BD
Cytometry Systems Oxford).
PCR and RT-PCR. For HA RT-PCR, TDLN from mice with T3 or
RencaHA were isolated and total RNA was extracted from single-cell
suspension using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer’s
instructions (20). cDNA was synthesized using a cDNA synthesis kit
(Invitrogen). For the HA PCR, the following primers were used: 5¶C A A T T G G G G A A A T G TA A C A T C G C C G - 3 ¶, 5 ¶- A G C T T T G G GTA TGAGCCCTCCTTC-3¶; cycling conditions were 94jC/5 min, 28 cycles for
94jC/30 s, 61jC/30 s (HA). The stable integration of the COX-2 cDNA
into the T3 genome was examined by PCR. COX-2 RT-PCR was
performed on single-cell suspensions of RencaHA and T3 cell lines from
in vitro cultures using the RETROscipt reverse transcription kit (Ambion),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The COX-2 primer
sequences used were 5¶-ATGCTCTTCCGAGCTGTGC-3¶ and 5¶-TTACAGCTCAGTTGAACGCC-3¶. The hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase
(HPPRT) primers used were as follows: 5¶-GTTGGATACAGGCCAGACTTTGTTG-3¶ and 5¶-GAAGGGTAGGCTGGCCTATAGGCT-3¶. For
COX-2, the PCR cycle conditions were 94jC/2 min and 30 s, 94jC/
30 s, 57jC/30 s, 72jC/30 s for 30 cycles and finally 72jC/7 min. For
HPRT, the PCR cycle conditions were 94jC/2 min and 30 s, 94jC/30 s,
60jC/30 s, 72jC/30 s for 28 cycles and finally 72jC/7 min.
Statistical analysis. P values were calculated with the Student’s t test
using the Prism 4.03 software (GraphPad Software, Inc.), with two-tailed
distribution and two-sample equal variance parameter.

Results
PGE2 inhibits dendritic cell maturation in vitro. Previous
studies in vitro have shown that PGE2 exerts different effects on the
cytokine profile of dendritic cells depending on their stage of
differentiation and maturation (25). We wished to determine
whether dendritic cell maturation was altered if PGE2 was present
during differentiation. iDC were generated in vitro from bone
marrow stem cells in the presence or absence of exogenous PGE2,
either before or during LPS maturation (Fig. 1A). Treatment of iDC
cultures with LPS on day 9 of differentiation resulted in dendritic
cell maturation to form mDC, as evidenced by increased expression
of MHC class I, CD80, CD86, and CD40, compared with iDC.
However, when iDC were differentiated in the presence of PGE2,
expression of MHC class I was reduced compared with untreated
iDC, yet up-regulation of CD80 and CD86 was observed.
Importantly, treatment of iDC with PGE2 at the same time as

Effect of PGE2 on Antitumor CD8+ T-Cell Responses

LPS prevented increased expression of MHC class I, CD80, CD86,
and CD40 compared with untreated LPS-mDC. Similarly, the
presence of PGE2 during differentiation into iDC reduced their
ability to mature. However, CD40 and CD86 expression was higher
among dendritic cells differentiated in the presence of PGE2, and
matured with LPS, compared with dendritic cells matured in the
presence of PGE2. Taken together, these data suggest that PGE2
renders iDC refractory to maturation signals when present either
during differentiation, or during maturation, with the latter being
more susceptible to the effects of PGE2.
PGE2 present during dendritic cell maturation abrogates
CL4 T-cell activation in vitro. To evaluate the consequences
following priming of naı̈ve CD8+ T cells by PGE2-conditioned
dendritic cells, purified naı̈ve CL4 cells were cocultured with PGE2treated, KdHA peptide-pulsed dendritic cells, and their ability to
proliferate and exhibit CTL effector function was analyzed in vitro
(Fig. 1B and C). Coculturing naı̈ve CL4 cells with mDC resulted in a
10-fold increase in proliferation, compared with co-culturing in the
presence of iDC. PGE2 treatment of iDC did not affect proliferation
of cells compared with untreated iDC. However, coculturing CL4
cells with LPS-mDC treated with PGE2 during their differentiation
reduced CL4 proliferation compared with CL4 cells cocultured with
LPS-mDC. Critically, treatment of iDC with PGE2 at the same time
as LPS abrogated CL4 cell proliferation. These data suggest that
conditioning of dendritic cells with PGE2 suppresses their APC
function, which is greatest during dendritic cell maturation.
Following naı̈ve CL4 cell coculture with iDC, few CL4 cells
increased expression of CD69 and elaborated IFN-g upon
restimulation with KdHA peptide. Furthermore, >70% and 90%
of CL4 cells were Ly6Chi and CTLA-4hi, respectively (Fig. 1C).
Such a phenotype is consistent with the cell surface phenotype
of CL4 CD8+ T cells undergoing abortive activation and
peripheral tolerance induction (23, 26, 27). When naı̈ve CL4
cells were cocultured with LPS-mDC, >70% of CL4 cells
expressed CD69, the number of IFN-g+ cells increased, and only
around half of the cells were Ly6Chi and CTLA-4hi, suggesting
that these cells were undergoing productive activation to form
effector CTL (23). Following PGE2 treatment, iDC were still able
to induce abortive activation of CL4 cells; however, PGE2
treatment prevented productive activation by mDC. The shift
in response in favor of abortive activation occurred regardless of
whether dendritic cells were treated with PGE2 during differentiation or maturation.
Blocking IL-10R in vitro reverses the inhibitory effect of
PGE2 on dendritic cell function. Thus far, the data suggest that
PGE2 exerts immunosuppressive effects on dendritic cell function.
PGE2 is known to cause increased production of IL-10 by dendritic
cells (28), which has been shown to reduce dendritic cell
maturation (8, 29), and dampen productive activation of CD8+
T cells by dendritic cells (30). Therefore, we wished to evaluate the
levels of IL-10 production by dendritic cells during differentiation
and LPS maturation in the presence or absence of PGE2 by ELISA
(Fig. 2A). IL-10 production was approximately equal among both
iDC and LPS-mDC. Treatment of iDC with PGE2 alone had no
effect on IL-10 production compared with either untreated iDC or
with mDC (Fig. 2A). However, when PGE2 was present during
dendritic cell differentiation followed by LPS maturation, IL-10
production increased by 2-fold compared with LPS-mDC. Moreover, when PGE2 was present during LPS maturation on day 9,
IL-10 production increased by >3-fold compared with dendritic
cells matured without PGE2.

To investigate whether the production of IL-10 by dendritic
cells has a role in abortive activation, iDC were treated with anti–
IL-10R mAb during maturation with LPS in the presence or
absence of PGE2, and used as APC for CL4 CD8+ T-cell activation
in vitro. Subsequently, CL4 cells isolated from the cultures were
analyzed for IFN-g production. Treatment of iDC and mDC with
the anti–IL-10R mAb resulted in an increase in IFN-g+ CL4 cells
compared with those cocultured with isotype-treated iDC and
mDC, respectively (Fig. 2B). Similarly, anti–IL-10R mAb-treated
iDC, which were conditioned with PGE2 during maturation,
significantly increased the %IFN-g+ CL4 cells to the same level as
the isotype-treated mDC cultures. To examine whether blocking
IL-10 during dendritic cell–CL4 cell interaction enhances CL4
effector function, CL4 cells were cultured with dendritic cells in
the presence of the anti–IL-10R mAb or an isotype control mAb,
and then analyzed for IFN-g production. Figure 2C shows that
treatment of mDC-CL4 cell cocultures with anti–IL-10R mAb did
not alter the proportion of IFN-g+ CL4 cells compared with
isotype-treated mDC cocultures. However, blocking of IL-10R in
iDC cocultures resulted in a significant increase in %IFN-g+ CL4
cells above that of both isotype-treated and anti–IL-10R mAbtreated mDC cocultures. Regardless of the presence or absence of
anti–IL-10R mAb, coculturing of naı̈ve CL4 with iDC conditioned
with PGE2 during maturation did not result in an increase in
proportion of IFN-g+ CL4 cells compared with coculturing with
mDC (Fig. 2C).
COX-2–overexpressing RencaHA (T3) tumor cells do not
prime naive CL4 cells in vivo. Previous studies in our laboratory
have shown that cross-presentation of RencaHA cell–derived KdHA
epitopes by BMDC results in priming of naı̈ve KdHA-specific CL4
CD8+ T cells (21) within the TDLN of conventional BALB/c mice,
giving rise to the formation of CTL effector and tumor-infiltrating
T cells (TIL; ref. 20). To examine the effects of COX-2 overexpression on the induction of tumor-specific CTL responses
in vivo, RencaHA cells were transfected with a murine COX-2 cDNA
to establish a COX-2–overexpressing cell line (T3; Fig. 3A and B),
which resulted in a significant increase in PGE2 release by T3 cells
in vitro (Fig. 3C). Importantly, treatment of T3 cells with the COX2–specific inhibitor NS-398 decreased PGE2 production by T3 to
the same level as that produced by RencaHA, indicating that
increased PGE2 production by T3 was due to the overexpression of
COX-2. Importantly, flow cytometric analyses showed that there
were equivalent levels of cell surface HA protein and MHC class I
expression among the RencaHA and T3 cell lines (Fig. 3D). In
addition, both tumors were able to grow at the same rate in BALB/
c mice (data not shown).
To examine the effect of COX-2 overexpression on antitumor CL4
cell responses, Thy1.2+ BALB/c mice were injected s.c. with 1  106
RencaHA or T3 cells on day 0 followed by CFSE-labeled naı̈ve
Thy1.1+ CL4 cells on day 11. On days 16 and 21, TDLN and tumors
were removed, respectively, and CL4 cell infiltration was assessed
by flow cytometric analyses (Fig. 4). In mice given RencaHA cells,
CFSE-labeled Thy1.1+ CL4 cells proliferated in the TDLN,
elaborated IFN-g upon restimulation with KdHA peptide in vitro,
and formed TIL. However, despite both T3 and RencaHA tumors
growing to a similar size in vivo, few Thy1.1+ CL4 cells proliferated
and produced IFN-g in the TDLN of T3 tumor-bearing mice, and,
as a consequence, very few CL4 cells were present among all of the
TIL isolated from the tumors. The lack of CL4 cell proliferation in
the TDLN was dependent on COX-2 overexpression, as the use
of NS-398 restored CL4 cell proliferation in the TDLN of T3

suggest that COX-2 overexpression by T3 tumors prevents the
formation of both tumor-specific CTL and TIL.
CL4 cells undergo abortive activation in response to T3
tumor in vivo. To determine whether COX-2 overexpression by
T3 induces abortive activation of CL4 CD8+ T cells in vivo, CFSElabeled CL4 cells recovered from the TDLN of RencaHA and T3
tumor-bearing mice were characterized for the expression of
Ly6C (23). Examination of the TDLN of tumor-bearing mice
revealed that, whereas the majority of dividing CL4 cells in the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (18). September 15, 2008

TDLN of RencaHA tumor-bearing mice were Ly6Clo, the majority
of the dividing CL4 cells in the TDLN of T3-bearing mice were
Ly6Chi (Fig. 4C). These data suggest that overexpression of PGE2,
due to the presence of the COX-2 transgene, promotes abortive
activation and tolerance induction among naı̈ve CL4 cells in the
TDLN.
Fewer dendritic cells are present within T3 tumors. Data in
Fig. 2 suggest that PGE2 influences dendritic cell function by
promoting IL-10 production. Other studies have shown that IL-10
overexpression by tumor cells reduces accumulation of dendritic
cells within the tumor (31). Therefore, flow cytometric analyses of

Effect of PGE2 on Antitumor CD8+ T-Cell Responses

RencaHA and T3 tumors were carried out to determine the
absolute numbers of tumor-infiltrating CD11c+ dendritic cells (32).
Figure 4D shows a significant increase in the absolute numbers of
CD11c+ cells within the RencaHA tumors compared with T3
tumors, suggesting that COX-2 overexpression, and increased PGE2
production that occurs as a result, may influence the accumulation
of dendritic cells in the tumor.
Exogenous PGE2 abrogates direct activation of CL4 cells
by tumor cells. The data indicate that PGE2 overproduction by
T3 cells may interfere with cross-presentation by dendritic cells,
preventing activation of antitumor CL4 CTL responses in vivo.
However, other studies have shown that overexpression of COX-2

by tumors increases motility and angiogenesis among tumor
cells in vivo (16, 17), allowing them to form metastases in the
local TDLN. The formation of metastases may provide a
mechanism for activation of the antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses
directly by tumors (18). Therefore, we investigated whether
tumor cells were present in the TDLN of BALB/c mice given T3
or RencaHA. On day 16, the TDLN from each group of mice
were isolated and cDNA was prepared for RT-PCR analyses.
Whereas HA mRNA was not detected in any of the TDLN from
RencaHA-bearing mice (Fig. 5), HA mRNA could be detected in
the TDLN of T3-bearing mice, suggesting that T3 tumor cells
had migrated to these LN.

Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that RencaHA
cells are able to directly prime CL4 CTL responses in vitro, leading
to tumor cell lysis (20). To investigate whether the presence of PGE2
during this interaction interferes with naive CL4 CTL priming,
RencaHA cells were cocultured for 72 hours with CFSE-labeled CL4
cells in the presence or absence of PGE2. Following coculture, CL4
cells were isolated and analyzed for the expression of the activation
markers CD69, CD28, and intracellular IFN-g. RencaHA and KdHA

indicating the activation of these T cells (Fig. 5). As previously
shown, CL4 cells cultured with HA-negative control RencaNT cells
failed to up-regulate expression of any of these molecules, thus
indicating that CL4 T-cell responses to RencaHA cells are KdHA
specific (20). Significantly, compared with CL4 cells cultured

of IFN-g, and cell surface expression of CD28 was abrogated among
CL4 cells cultured with RencaHA in the presence of PGE2. However,
the fact that these undivided CL4 cells up-regulated CD69 indicated
that initial priming had occurred without inducing CL4 CTL
responses (Fig. 5B-D).

Discussion
In this report, we show that PGE2 abrogates both crosspresentation and direct presentation pathways involved in the
priming of naı̈ve tumor-specific CL4 CD8+ T-cell responses. The
data show that whereas priming of naı̈ve CL4 T cells by KdHA

peptide-pulsed mDC resulted in their productive activation,
coculturing with PGE2-treated mDC resulted in reduced CL4
effector function, similar to that which occurs following priming by
iDC. This finding is consistent with other studies that showed
reduced APC function of dendritic cells, treated with PGE2 (25).
It is likely that the lack of productive activation of naı̈ve CL4 T cells
results from the immature phenotype of PGE2-treated dendritic
cells that were used as APC. Other in vivo studies from several
laboratories, including our own, have shown that, whereas the
interaction of antigen-loaded mDC with naı̈ve CD8+ T cells
activates effector CD8+ T-cell responses, cross-presentation of
antigens by iDC to CD8+ T cells has been shown to induce
tolerance (23, 33, 34). Furthermore, the abortive activation
phenotype, displayed by CL4 cells within the TDLN of mice
bearing T3 tumors, is consistent with the increased ability of
PGE2-treated iDC to migrate to TDLN (35). Although not tested
in this study, it has been shown that increased migration of iDC to
the TDLN is associated with an increase in the expression of CCR7
following PGE2 treatment of iDC.
Our studies show that PGE2 treatment of dendritic cells during
their differentiation or maturation increases IL-10 production
compared with mDC. This is in accordance with previous studies
where PGE2 was shown to induce IL-10 production by dendritic
cells in vitro (6). Importantly, such an increase in IL-10 release by
dendritic cells after exposure to PGE2 may account for the lower
numbers of TIDC in T3 tumors compared with RencaHA tumors
(31). The importance of IL-10 in PGE2-mediated inhibitory effects
on dendritic cells was notable, as blocking of IL-10R during
dendritic cell maturation reversed the effects of PGE2 on APC
function of dendritic cells. Consistent with other studies, fully
matured dendritic cells were resistant to the effects of IL-10 (8, 25).
We hypothesize that the type of CL4 CD8+ T-cell response
generated by PGE2-treated dendritic cells is determined at the site
of dendritic cell maturation in the tumor microenvironment
through increased production of IL-10. In addition, the data
presented here may indicate a possible role of IL-10 in iDCmediated abortive activation of CL4 cells and that blocking of
IL-10R during iDC-CL4 interaction counters the ability of iDC to
induce tolerance.
In vivo, COX-2 overexpression by T3 tumors rendered CL4 cells
unable to proliferate, produce IFN-g, or form TIL. Previous
studies in our laboratory showed that in vivo, CL4 cell responses
to RencaHA tumors rely on cross-presentation of HA antigen by
BMDC (36). Data presented in this report show that overexpression of COX-2 enables T3 tumor cells to migrate to the

TDLN, indicating that T3 cells could also directly activate CL4
cells. However, the lack of CL4 cell activation in the TDLN of T3
tumor-bearing mice suggests that direct activation by T3 cells
does not occur. Indeed, when RencaHA were cultured with CL4
cells in vitro in the presence of PGE2 at a concentration
comparable with that found within the tumor microenvironment
of COX-2–overexpressing tumors (37), CL4 CTL responses were
abolished. However, undivided CD8+ CL4 cells lost CD28
expression. The presence of CD8+ CD28 T cells with regulatory
functions has been observed in patients with different types of
cancer (38, 39). Thus, in our system, a second stage of CD8+ T-cell
tolerance could occur through direct interaction of T3 with CL4
cells.
Overall, our data suggest that COX-2/PGE2 overexpression by
tumors regulates both direct and indirect antigen presentation to
naive CD8+ T cells. We propose that PGE2 within the tumor
microenvironment both reduces the accumulation of TIDC, thus
inhibiting antigen uptake, and maintains TIDC in an immature
state that induces CD8+ T-cell tolerance upon migration to the
TDLN. In addition, COX-2/PGE2 overexpression by tumors allows
migration of tumors to TDLN, also resulting in CD8+ T celltolerance induction. These findings provide us with an understanding of how PGE2-overproducing tumor cells can regulate
antitumor CD8+ T-cell responses. Critically, we and others have
shown that dendritic cells that have already undergone maturation are refractory to the effects of PGE2 and IL-10 (25).
Therefore, immunotherapeutic strategies that use ex vivo
generated mDC, rather than iDC (40), loaded with tumor antigen,
would be preferable to prime protective antitumor CD8+ CTL
response in patients with cancer. Furthermore, the use of PGE2
inhibitors in patients with cancer would also be greatly desirable
in promoting productive activation of antitumor CTL cell
responses potentially generating fewer side effects than COX-2–
specific inhibitors (41).
