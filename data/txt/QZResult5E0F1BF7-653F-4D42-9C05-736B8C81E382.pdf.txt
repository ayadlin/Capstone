ABSTRACT:

A challenge in cancer therapy has been to identify targets whose function is essential
for survival of malignant cells but not normal cells. This Perspective discusses recent
evidence that novel inhibitors of the kinase TOR can provide an unprecedented balance
of anti-cancer efficacy and tolerability.

both TORC1 and TORC2 function to orchestrate and maintain the excessive proliferative demands of tumorigenic
cells [11-14].
Within the last year, a series of ATP-competitive catalytic site TOR inhibitors (TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors) have
been developed, and compared to rapamycin (and “rapalogs”) that use an allosteric-based mechanism to inhibit
TOR [15-21]. These reports strongly support the conclusion that TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors provide an improved
strategy to target the PI3K/AKT/TOR network for therapeutic benefit in cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Dysregulation of cell growth and proliferation have
been commonly linked to phosphoinositide 3-kinase
(PI3K) and its downstream signaling effectors, which
include the serine/threonine kinases AKT and target of
rapamycin (TOR). Through activating mutations in PI3K
or AKT, inactivating mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor, or other mechanisms, there are many routes to
augment PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling that promote cardinal
hallmarks of malignant transformation [1]. A worldwide
effort in academic and biopharma laboratories has resulted
in a number of new therapeutic strategies to target one of
more components of this complex signaling network [2-7].
Several small molecule inhibitors have shown impressive
preclinical efficacy and are now in clinical trials. However,
it has not been clear which of these approaches will best
suppress oncogenic signaling while sparing normal cell
homeostasis.
TOR is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase that integrates
both extracellular and intracellular signals to regulate cell
growth, protein translation and metabolism [8-10]. Mammalian TOR (often termed mTOR) exists in two functionally distinct multi-protein complexes, TOR complex
1 (TORC1) and TOR complex 2 (TORC2). TOR kinase
interacts with RAPTOR, LST8, FKBP38, DEPTOR and
PRAS40 to form TORC1, or with RICTOR, LST8, SIN1,
DEPTOR and PROTOR to form TORC2. The complexity of the signaling network is illustrated by the fact that
TORC1 functions downstream of AKT, whereas TORC2
functions upstream (Fig. 1). Recent evidence indicates that

Mechanistic differences of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors
and rapalogs
TORC1 is an essential sensor for amino acids, oxygen,
energy, and growth factor signaling [8-10]. When conditions are favorable for cell growth and division, TORC1
integrates these signals to promote mRNA translation, ribosome biogenesis and glycolytic metabolism. Two notable
TORC1 substrates are S6K1 (on Thr389) and 4EBP1 (on
several sites) (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation of S6K1 activates
the enzyme, leading to increased phosphorylation of the
S6 ribosomal protein and other substrates that regulate
translation. Phosphorylation of 4EBP1 blocks its function as a suppressor of the initiation factor eIF4E. Rapamycin disrupts the TORC1 complex and partially inhibits
TORC1 activity, with greater effects on phosphorylation of
S6K than 4EBP1 [22-24]. This is an important distinction
because of emerging evidence that 4EBP1 inhibition is a
crucial gatekeeper of regulated mRNA translation and is

more important than S6K for cellular transformation [12,
14]. TORC2 is activated through unknown mechanisms,
and is insensitive to nutrients, energy or acute rapamycin
treatment. TORC2 regulates a subgroup of AGC family
kinases (Fig. 1), which include AKT, SGK (serum– and
glucocorticoid–induced protein kinase), and PKC (protein
kinase C), by phosphorylating the hydrophobic and turn
motifs [25-28]. Genetic ablation of TORC2 (via deletion of
rictor or Sin1) has significant impact on metabolic tissues
[29-31] but seems to be selectively toxic to cancer cells
compared to normal cells [11, 16, 17, 19, 26].
Rapamycin and rapalogs (everolimus, temsirolimus)
can slow the proliferation of cancer cell lines and have
achieved some success in specific malignancies [23, 32].
Unfortunately, however, their overall efficacy as cancer
therapeutics has been limited. The major drawbacks of rapalogs are: 1) S6K is exquisitely inhibited, yet the control of
4EBP and mRNA translation is far less sensitive [23, 24];
2) TORC2 activity is not acutely blocked (though it can be
suppressed upon sustained exposure [33]); 3) the loss of a
feedback inhibition pathway mediated by S6K results in
amplified PI3K signaling, with potential to amplify RAS,
MAPK, and TORC2 itself [34-38]. In addition to these
drawbacks, cell-extrinsic factors have been reported to
prompt rapalog resistance in the clinical setting of recurrent
PTEN-deficient glioblastomas [39]. To overcome these
drawbacks, the pursuit of selective TOR kinase inhibitors
has been a strong priority [23, 40]. ATP-competitive TOR
kinase inhibitors that also inhibit PI3K and other enzymes
have been studied for decades, exemplified by the highly
nonselective compound LY294002 and the more refined
panPI3K/TOR inhibitors PI-103 and BEZ-235 [3, 6, 7].
These compounds generally have stronger anti-cancer
activity than rapalogs, but strong PI3K inhibition might be
a liability when considering toxicity to normal cells (see
below).
A report from the Shokat group was the first to describe
ATP-competitive inhibitors that selectively inhibit TOR,
and to document the mechanistic differences between TOR
kinase inhibitors and rapamycin [16]. Soon after, several
other groups confirmed these findings using TOR kinase
inhibitors with distinct chemical scaffolds [15, 17, 19-21].
In each case, the active-site inhibitor completely blocked
TORC1 signaling (both S6KThr389 and 4EBP1Thr37/46 and
Ser65) and TORC2 signaling (AKTSer473). In fibroblasts,
muscle cells and solid tumor cell lines, the inhibition of
rapamycin-resistant TOR outputs was associated with stronger suppression of protein synthesis and cell proliferation,
and greater impact on cell size and metabolism. Possible
mechanisms for differential effects on mRNA translation
and metabolism were reviewed recently [40]. Supporting
the selectivity of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors, none of the
compounds strongly reduced phosphorylation of AKT on
Thr308, the activation loop site that is phosphorylated in
a PI3K-dependent manner by phosphoinositide-dependent

Red indicates TORC2-dependent steps. Blue indicates TORC1dependent steps. The arrow between AKT and TORC1 represents
a multistep process, in which activated AKT and other inputs from

of upstream signaling through several mechanisms.

kinase-1 (PDK-1).
In fibroblasts, the anti-proliferative effects of TORC1/2
kinase inhibitors were entirely attributable to TORC1 inhibition. Thus, cells lacking TORC2 components proliferated
normally yet retained full sensitivity to TORC1/2 kinase
inhibitors [16, 17, 19]. The relative importance of TORC1
vs. TORC2 inhibition for suppression of cancer cell proliferation and survival is not yet clear, and might be dependent on cell context. If TORC2 inhibition contributes to the
mechanism, it will be important to determine which TORC2
substrates are the relevant mediators of cancer cell growth
and survival. Although much attention has focused on
TORC2-dependent phosphorylation of AKT (on Ser473),
regulation of SGK and PKC might be of crucial importance in some contexts. With PDK-1-dependent phosphorylation of AKTT308 intact, AKT remains partially active
in TORC2-deficient cells [41, 42]. In contrast, TORC2dependent phosphorylation of the SGK hydrophobic loop
is a prerequisite for SGK phosphorylation on the activation loop [26]. The SGK family (SGK1, SGK2, SGK3)
of AGC kinases share strong (>50%) homology with the
AKT kinase domain. SGK1 shares substrate preference
for FOXO transcription factors (Fig. 1), a well-described
target of AKT [43]. SGK3 plays a role in AKT-independent
survival in a variety of cancers driven by activating mutations in PI3K [44]. Therefore, SGK may be a key target
of TORC2 and the potency attributed to TORC1/2 kinase
inhibitors could be due in part to diminished SGK activation. PKC activity might also contribute to tumor growth
[45].
An interesting twist to TOR biology was the discovery
of DEPTOR as an endogenous inhibitor of both mTOR

sure of PI3K activity. In vitro, PP242 caused cell cycle
arrest similar to rapamycin, but also triggered apoptosis. In
a mouse syngeneic model of Ph+ B-ALL, PP242 prolonged
survival whereas rapamycin had no protective effect. In
these experiments we also compared PP242 to compounds
representing the panPI3K/TOR target profile. Notably, we
found that the efficacy of PP242 in vitro and in vivo was
comparable to PI-103 or BEZ-235. These results indicate
that PI3K inhibition is dispensable for strong anti-leukemic
efficacy when both TOR complexes are fully suppressed.
PP242 also slowed growth and caused apoptosis in vivo
when tested in a mouse thymoma model [12]; rapamycin
had no protective effect in this model.
In patients with chronic phase CML, impressive therapeutic responses have been achieved with BCR-ABL
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) [47]. Unfortunately, TKI
resistance often develops and these agents fail to achieve
durable remission in later phases of CML (i.e. blast crisis)
or in patients with Ph+ B-ALL [48]. We compared the
ability of various TOR inhibitors to augment the efficacy
of BCR-ABL TKIs. Although functional synergy was
achieved with all combination approaches, PP242 was
more effective than rapamycin when combined with imatinib or dasatinib, both in vitro and in vivo. In mice bearing
xenografts of the Ph+ B-ALL cell line SUP-B15, dasatinib
plus PP242 caused leukemia regression whereas dasatinib plus rapamycin only slowed expansion. In xenografts
of primary human Ph+ B-ALL specimens, dasatinib plus
PP242 caused significantly greater inhibition of leukemia
cell proliferation compared to dasatinib alone. At the signaling level, PP242 suppressed TOR outputs more thoroughly than rapamycin even in the presence of BCR-ABL
TKIs, probably because cell-extrinsic factors provide an
alternative oncogene-independent route to TOR activation.
These results provide proof-of-concept that encourages
further testing of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors in combination with TKIs in other tumor settings (to avoid confusion,
we oppose a recent suggestion that TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors be abbreviated "TKIs" [40]). TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors also have broader anti-angiogenic impact than rapalogs
[20] and could enhance the efficacy of existing angiogenesis
inhibitors. Indeed, in a renal cell carcinoma model the compound WYE-132 showed greater ability than CCI-779 to
synergize with bevacizumab (Avastin), a monoclonal antibody to VEGF-A [20]. These findings highlight the clinical
potential of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors for combinatorial
therapies. Careful strategies will need to be employed when
developing a dosing regimen to best obtain the full therapeutic benefit of drug combinations.

complexes [46]. Peterson, Sabatini and colleagues tested
whether overexpression of DEPTOR could phenocopy cells
treated with TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors. They observed
that a prominent effect of DEPTOR was to augment AKT
activity through disabling of the negative feedback loop
mediated by S6K. The rebound activation of PI3K was
strong enough to override DEPTOR’s inhibitory effect on
TORC2, such that AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 was
maintained. They further showed that prolonged treatment of cells with suboptimal doses of TORC1/2 kinase
inhibitors also elevated AKT phosphorylation. These findings emphasize that when TORC1 activity is reduced, any
remaining TORC2 activity can phosphorylate AKT and
other substrates that are co-regulated via PI3K/PDK-1. In
other words, a complete and optimal amount of TORC1/2
inhibition might need to be achieved and maintained to prevent rebound activation of PI3K signaling. Consequently,
it will be important to monitor the degree of PI3K function
and downstream signaling in cells and tissues exposed to
different doses of TORC1/2 inhibitors.
Efficacy of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors in vivo
Several TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors have been tested
in cancer models in vivo. The first publication, from a
group at Wyeth, showed that the compound WYE-354
could delay growth of U87MG tumors in nude mice [21].
Lead optimization by this group led to the discovery of
the compound WYE-125132 (abbrev. WYE-132), which
showed strong single-agent activity in a range of xenograft
models representing various solid tumor types [20]. The
anti-tumor effect of WYE-132 was markedly stronger than
that achieved by the rapalog CCI-779. In some models,
regression was observed. Similarly, the TORC1/2 kinase
inhibitor AZD8055 (developed by AstraZeneca) demonstrated growth inhibition and/or regression in xenograft
models [15]. In each of these studies, in vitro experiments
confirmed that TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors block rapalogresistant outputs of TORC1 and TORC2 across a range of
cancer cell lines. Interestingly, WYE-354 failed to inhibit
protein synthesis in the colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and
HT29 and this was associated with absence of pro-apoptotic effects [21, 40]. Further study of cell lines and primary
specimens that are resistant to TORC1/2 inhibitors might
provide biomarkers that can be used to predict efficacy.
Our group compared the TORC1/2 kinase inhibitor PP242 to rapamycin in acute leukemia models driven
by the BCR-ABL fusion tyrosine kinase encoded by the
t(9;22) Philadelphia (Ph) chromosomal translocation [18].
As in studies of fibroblasts and solid tumor cell lines, we
found that PP242 blocked rapamycin-resistant TORC1 and
TORC2 signaling outputs in mouse and human leukemia
cells representing either Ph+ B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML). PP242 did not alter cellular levels of PIP3, a meawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget/

Tolerability of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors in vivo

we know about mTOR and its roles in immunological func71

Fig. 2. Working models to explain selective effects of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors on leukemia cells (A) and rapalogs on normal lymphocytes (B). The threshold model (A) posits that leukemia cells depend on a higher output of
mTOR signaling for growth and survival. Leukemia cells commit to cell death process when TORC1 and TORC2 are
strongly (or transiently) suppressed, whereas normal lymphocytes grow more slowly but do not die. At intermediate
levels of mTOR signaling, leukemia cells exhibit slower growth whereas normal cells are unaffected. The scheme
in panel (B) proposes that in normal lymphocytes, rapamycin and analogs inhibit TORC1 and TORC2 more effectively than in leukemia cells. Because rapalogs act through an allosteric mechanism, the magnitude and kinetics of
their effects might differ depending on the composition and turnover of TOR complexes in distinct cell contexts. We
reported experimental evidence to support the threshold model in (A) [18], but further work is necessary to test the
model in (B).

tion has derived from experiments using rapamycin. It is
now clear that rapamycin suppresses T and B cell proliferation, and promotes tolerance induction through at least
three mechanisms: induction of T cell anergy, generation of
regulatory T cells (Tregs), and impairment of dendritic cell
maturation [49-51]. Paradoxically, rapamycin enhances the
generation and quality of CD8 T cell memory [52, 53], and
also potentiates inflammatory responses of innate immune
cells [49-51]. In addition to these immune effects, systemic
rapamycin treatment in humans results in other significant
toxicities [54].
Given the more complete suppression of TOR signaling by ATP-competitive inhibitors, one might expect
these compounds to have even more severe toxicities and
immunomodulatory activities. However, the evidence so
far indicates that this is not the case. Several TORC1/2
kinase inhibitors have entered clinical trials, indicating that
animals tolerate these compounds at doses that produce
therapeutic effects. In our leukemia models, we noted that
PP242 was not toxic to normal mouse bone marrow cells
under conditions where human Ph+ B-ALL cells disappear
[18]. In fact, proliferation of endogenous bone marrow
cells returned in mice treated with dasatinib plus PP242.
In vitro, PP242 caused hematotoxicity only at concentra-

tions much higher than those needed to cause leukemia
cell death. Remarkably, PP242 and the structurally unrelated TORC1/2 inhibitor Ku-0063794 had little impact on
the proliferation of activated lymphocytes, whereas these
responses were strongly suppressed by rapamycin. Mice
treated with rapamycin showed a disruption of lymphoid
architecture and a near-complete block in T cell-dependent
antibody responses. These effects were not observed in
mice treated with PP242 at doses showing profound suppression of leukemia. Importantly, the panPI3K/TOR inhibitor PI-103 showed less selectivity for leukemia cells and
was reported by another group to be immunosuppressive
[55]. Thus, selective TORC1/2 kinase inhibition provides
a favorable tolerability profile compared to rapamycin or
panPI3K/TOR inhibitors.
It is interesting to speculate on the mechanism of selective anti-cancer effects of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors.
Mouse models of PTEN-deficient prostate cancer support
the idea that cancer cells with elevated PI3K signaling are
uniquely addicted to TORC2 [11, 13]. One study showed
that simultaneously deleting Pten and mTor in the prostate
epithelium suppressed prostate cancer development while
sparing the morphology and function of normal prostate
tissue [13]. The suppression of neoplasia was more pro-

nounced than with 4–week pharmacological treatment with
the rapalog RAD001. This observation does not distinguish whether the PTEN-deficient cells relied on rapalogresistant outputs of TORC1 or TORC2. However, another
group obtained similar results by deleting Rictor in the
prostate epithelium, showing that Pten-null driven prostate cancer progression requires TORC2 function [11]. In
support of this conclusion, knockdown of rictor expression
suppressed the development of a PTEN-null PC-3 human
prostate cancer xenograft model. The preservation of
normal tissue in the absence of TORC2 is consistent with
studies of mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). In MEFs, loss
of rictor or Sin1 does not affect cell proliferation and the
cells remain equally sensitive as wild-type MEFs to growth
suppression by TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors [16, 19]. On
the other hand, the fact that complete TORC1 inhibition
strongly suppresses growth factor-dependent proliferation
of MEFs implies that TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors should
have negative impacts on mitotic tissues. Indeed, we found
that PP242 did suppress hematopoietic colony formation
and lymphocyte proliferation at a high concentration (1µM)
[18]. We propose a “threshold” model in which normal cells
can tolerate a lower output of TORC1 and TORC2 signaling than transformed cells (Fig. 2A). In some cell types,
such as prostate epithelium, mTor expression appears completely dispensable [13]. In other cell types, exemplified by
T lymphocytes, deletion of mTor delays but does not fully
arrest proliferation [56]. In support of the threshold model,
mice heterozygous for a kinase-dead allele of mTor show
no impairment of T cell proliferation [57].
Perhaps a greater puzzle is why rapamycin seems more
potent at suppressing normal lymphocytes than leukemia
cells or solid tumor cell lines. It is possible that lymphocyte
signaling complexes are wired differently, such that rapamycin suppresses TOR outputs that are resistant to the drug
in other settings (Fig. 2B). There is evidence that the magnitude and kinetics of rapamycin’s effect on 4EBP1 phosphorylation and TORC2 function are cell type-dependent
[22, 33]. Alternatively, feedback effects of TORC1 inhibition might have severe impact in primary lymphocytes.
There is also evidence that rapamycin disrupts noncatalytic
scaffolding functions of TOR [58-60], whereas TORC1/2
kinase inhibitors do not affect the complexes [20]. It is
worth testing these models in lymphocytes and in cancer
cell lines that are particularly sensitive to rapamycin.

importance.
First, we need a greater understanding of the mechanism of action of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors in cancer
cells. Which cellular processes regulated by TORC1 and/
or TORC2 are relevant to the therapeutic effects? These
efforts will help identify biomarkers of drug efficacy and
resistance. A recent study from the Ruggero group provided important insights in a mouse thymoma model driven
by activated AKT [12]. This study showed that TORC1dependent eIF4E hyperactivation (via 4EBP1 inactivation)
was essential for tumor growth, whereas S6K activation
was dispensable. In this model, the pro-apoptotic effect of
PP242 was entirely dependent on the 4EBP1/eIF4E axis.
However, it remains possible that TORC2 inhibition contributes to death of cancer cells that do not express a constitutively active AKT molecule. An interesting finding of
Hsieh et al. was that regulated translation of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member MCL-1 might play a unique
pro-survival role. MCL-1 was also found to be modulated
by PI3K/TOR signaling in the setting of mutant epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR) driven non-small cell lung
cancers [61]. It will be interesting to determine whether
TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors trigger cell cycle arrest also by
controlling expression of specific proteins, or through general inhibition of translation.
Second, it will be important to determine the efficacy of
TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors across a broad range of tumor
types and driving mutations. Human cancers are heterogeneous, and xenograft models have already shown variable
responses of solid tumors and primary leukemias [15, 18,
20]. Preclinical screens of drug efficacy can provide valuable information about which populations are most likely
to benefit from any targeted agent. Identifying tumor characteristics that correlate with drug resistance will also be
valuable, as understanding the molecular basis of resistance can lead to combination approaches that achieve
greater efficacy. There might also be heterogeneity within
tumors such that subpopulations, for example quiescent
cells with stem-like properties, survive independently of
TOR activity. A related issue is the need to test TORC1/2
kinase inhibitors in combination with current front-line
therapies. It is likely that novel targeted agents will be
tested first in clinical settings where standard therapy has
failed, but could eventually be used as adjuvant therapy to
augment the initial response. Our data provide strong justification for including TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors in clinical
protocols that involve TKIs targeting BCR-ABL or other
oncogenic kinases.
Third, we need to explore in greater detail how
TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors affect immune function. Our
published experiments with lymphocyte proliferation and
antibody production have only scratched the surface of this
important problem. TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors should be
evaluated in various settings in which rapalogs have a profound impact: innate immune cell function, T and B cell

FUTURE DIRECTIONS
TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors represent a major breakthrough in targeting the PI3K/AKT/TOR signaling network
for cancer therapeutics. In order to realize the full clinical potential of these compounds, more basic research is
required. Here we emphasize three objectives of primary

differentiation, memory, and regulatory T cell induction.
It is likely that drug concentration will have an important
influence on functional outcomes, as illustrated by our
studies of lymphocyte proliferation [18]. Similarly, the
impact of TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors on immune function
in vivo will likely depend on pharmacokinetics---and may
therefore differ among different candidate molecules. An
important complementary approach will be to study mice
genetically deficient in individual mTOR complexes, to
elucidate the separate roles of TORC1 versus TORC2 on
innate and adaptive immune responses. One consequence
of these studies might be that TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors
have therapeutic value in certain immune-mediated diseases. In the setting of high-risk leukemias, it is essential
to eradicate minimal residual disease (MRD) following
chemotherapy regimens. One strategy to minimize MRD
is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT), where the donor marrow attacks recipient MRD,
also termed graft versus leukemia (GVL). It is interesting
to note that many active clinical trials of rapalogs in cancer
are testing their efficacy to suppress graft versus host disease (GVHD), a common allo-SCT complication. In the
setting where rapamycin is used to suppress GVHD, will
it also affect MRD by modulating GVL or through direct
effects on the residual leukemia cells? Will TORC1/2
inhibitors achieve similar immunosuppression of GVHD,
yet still achieve effective clearance of MRD? In solid
tumor settings, will TORC1/2 kinase inhibitors have different effects than rapalogs on immunological tolerance? As
TOR kinase-targeted therapies enter the clinical arena, it
will be important to understand how they will best complement or interact with current clinical practices to harness
immune responses and eradicate tumor cells.
