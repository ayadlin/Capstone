Abstract
We have previously shown that cisplatin triggers an early acid
sphingomyelinase (aSMase)-dependent ceramide generation
concomitantly with an increase in membrane fluidity and
induces apoptosis in HT29 cells. The present study further
explores the role and origin of membrane fluidification in
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. The rapid increase in membrane
fluidity following cisplatin treatment was inhibited by
membrane-stabilizing agents such as cholesterol or monosialoganglioside-1. In HT29 cells, these compounds prevented
the early aggregation of Fas death receptor and of membrane
lipid rafts on cell surface and significantly inhibited cisplatininduced apoptosis without altering drug intracellular uptake
or cisplatin DNA adducts formation. Early after cisplatin
treatment, Na +/H+ membrane exchanger-1 (NHE1) was
inhibited leading to intracellular acidification, aSMase was
activated, and ceramide was detected at the cell membrane.
Treatment of HT29 cells with Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase increased membrane fluidity. Moreover, pretreatment with cariporide, a specific inhibitor of NHE1, inhibited
cisplatin-induced intracellular acidification, aSMase activation, ceramide membrane generation, membrane fluidification, and apoptosis. Finally, NHE1-expressing PS120 cells were
more sensitive to cisplatin than NHE1-deficient PS120 cells.
Altogether, these findings suggest that the apoptotic pathway
triggered by cisplatin involves a very early NHE1-dependent
intracellular acidification leading to aSMase activation and
increase in membrane fluidity. These events are independent
of cisplatin-induced DNA adducts formation. The membrane
exchanger NHE1 may be another potential target of cisplatin,
increasing cell sensitivity to this compound. [Cancer Res

of cisplatin (1, 2), the cisplatin action at the cellular level still
remains unknown. In fact, cisplatin-induced DNA adducts activate
several signal transduction pathways culminating in the activation
of apoptosis (3). However, these specific biochemical lesions are
not sufficient to explain cisplatin cytotoxicity (4, 5), and the
potential contribution of other cellular targets requires further
investigation (6). Particularly, cisplatin has been shown to interact
with the plasma membrane and reduce the activity of certain ion
channels, transport proteins (7), and various plasma membrane
enzymes (8). Elucidating the mechanisms by which cisplatin kills
cancer cells may lead to develop new therapeutic strategy.
The plasma membrane constitutes the first cellular barrier that
encounter antineoplastic agents, and the importance of the lipid
bilayer as a medium in which diffusion of drugs takes place has been
far well established (9). Many anticancer drugs show membrane
effects via weak hydrophobic interaction or via electrostatic binding
to membrane phospholipids before entering the cytoplasm. In this
way, it has been shown that cisplatin can interact with phosphatidylserine to alter the characteristics of the membrane (10).
Recent findings indicate that variations of membrane fluidity
occurs in cells exposed to various cytotoxic stimuli including
cisplatin (11, 12). Increase in membrane fluidity could play a role in
apoptosis because membrane-stabilizing agents reduced this
increase as well as cell death induction in several cell models
(12–14). Moreover, recent studies showed the implication of membrane lipid rafts, which result from specific interactions between
various types of lipids and proteins (15, 16), in the Fas death
receptor pathway (17), and in the cytotoxicity of some anticancer
agents (18–20).
Several apoptotic stimuli require the acid sphingomyelinase
(aSMase) to trigger apoptosis and particularly some chemotherapeutics such as doxorubicin and cisplatin ( for a review, see
ref. 21). Two forms of aSMase coming from the same gene (aSMase
gene) have been described, an endolysosomal form and a secretory
form which is targeted to the plasma membrane (22, 23) and
implicated in stress-associated cell death. Intracellular acidification
has been detected following exposure of cells to various apoptotic
stimuli ( for a review, see ref. 24). Among the nine NHE family
members, the Na+/H+ membrane exchanger-1 (NHE1) is ubiquitously expressed and plays a critical role in intracellular pH and cell
volume homeostasis (25).
We have previously shown that cisplatin induces Fas receptor
clustering and activation independently of Fas ligand (FasL; ref. 26),
and the generation of ceramide and the relocalization of Fas receptor
molecules into lipid rafts of HT29 cells with a transient increase in
membrane fluidity (20). The present study further explores the role

of increased membrane fluidity in cisplatin-induced apoptosis and
identifies for the first time the molecular mechanisms involved in
this process. Cisplatin induces a very early NHE1-dependent intracellular acidification that favors aSMase activation, thereby increasing membrane fluidity and aggregation of membrane lipid rafts.

Immunofluorescence Microscopy and FluorescenceActivated Cell Sorting Analysis

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Antibodies
CDDP was from Merck, water-soluble cholesterol (CHOL) and exogenous
sphingomyelinase ( from Staphylococcus aureus) were from Sigma-Aldrich,
monosialoganglioside-1 (GM1) was purchased from Alexis Biochemicals,
and cariporide was a kind gift from Aventis (Frankfurt, Germany). SR33557
(SR) was kindly provided by Drs. C. Bezombes and J.P. Jaffrézou (Inserm
U563, Toulouse, France).
Hoechst 33342 and fluorescein-tagged cholera toxin subunit B (CTxFITC) were from Molecular Probes. TransFectine lipid and Bradford
reagents were from Bio-Rad. Mouse monoclonal immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)
anti-Fas (ZB4) was from Beckman Coulter. Mouse monoclonal IgM antiCER (15B4) was from Alexis Biochemicals.

Cell Culture and Treatments
HT29, HCT116, and SW480 human colon carcinoma cell lines were
obtained from the American Tissue Culture Collection (Biovalley) and
cultured in EMEM (Eurobio) complemented with 10% FCS (Life Technologies BRL) and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine (Life Technologies BRL). For all
experiments, cells were seeded onto tissue culture Petri dishes and allowed
to attach for 24 h before treatment. Cells, growing in exponential phase,
were treated with 25 Amol/L CDDP for different times. When indicated,
cells were pretreated for 2 h with various compounds.
The NHE1-deficient PS120 cell line (PS120) is a mutant Chinese hamster
fibroblast cell line that lacks NHE1 activity. This cell line was grown in
DMEM containing 15 mmol/L NaHCO3 supplemented with 7.5% FCS at
37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2–95% air. The NHE1-PS120 cells
are PS120 cells stably transfected with NHE1 (ref. 27; kindly provided by
Prof. Laurent Counillon, CNRS UMR 6548, Nice, France).

Cell Death Assays
See details in Supplementary Data (28).

Detection of Membrane Lipid Rafts by GM1 Staining with
CTx-FITC
HT29 cells were treated with 25 Amol/L cisplatin for various times. After
treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) for
15 min, washed in PBS 1, and then preincubated with PBS-bovine serum
albumin (PBS-BSA) 2% for 30 min before staining with CTx-FITC for 30 min.
The fluorescent images of GM1 staining were analyzed using a DMRXA
Leica microscope and a COHU high-performance CCD camera using a
metavue software.

Determination of Membrane Fluidity by Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance Spin-Labeling Method
Bulk membranes. The membrane fluidity of cells was determined by a
spin-labeling method using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). After
treatment, cells collected in PBS were incubated with 50 Ag/mL 12-DSA spin
label for 15 min at 37jC and then were washed thrice with cold PBS to
eliminate the free spin label. The final pellet was kept on ice to prevent any
spin label reduction before analyzing the EPR spectrum at room
temperature (20jC) using a Bruker ECS 106 spectrometer (9.82 GHz
frequency, 20 mW microwave power, 1.771 G modulation amplitude, and
100 kHz modulation frequency; Bruker Spectrospin). The values of inner
hyperfine-splitting EPR spectra, typical for 12-DSA spin label, were used to
calculate the membrane order parameter S. A decrease in the membrane
order parameter reflects an increase in membrane fluidity.
Lipid rafts. Lipid rafts were isolated by ultracentrifugation on sucrose
gradient as previously described (20). Briefly, after ultracentrifugation, 12
fractions of 1 mL were collected from the top of the gradient. The first six

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

fractions corresponding to membrane lipid rafts were pooled and
centrifuged at 39,000 rpm for 20 h at 4jC. The pellet was resuspended in
PBS, and the spin label was incorporated for 30 min at 4jC. After three
washes in cold PBS, the analysis of the EPR spectrum was done as described
above for bulk membranes.

After treatment, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich)
for 15 min, washed in PBS 1, and then preincubated with PBS-BSA 2% for
30 min before incubation for 2 h with a mouse monoclonal IgG1 anti-Fas
(ZB4, 1:150, Immunotech) or with a mouse monoclonal IgM anti-CER (15B4,
1:50, Alexis Biochemicals) or with isotype-matched controls. Cells were then
washed in PBS and stained for 45 min with FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse
IgG (Molecular Probes) or FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgM (Jackson
Immunoresearch Laboratories). The fluorescent images of ceramide and Fas
stainings were analyzed using a DMRXA Leica microscope and a COHU
high-performance CCD camera using a metavue software. Cell fluorescence
(FL-1) corresponding to ceramide staining was analyzed by flow cytometry
(FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson).

Measurement of Intracellular Platinum Content
Cells were treated with 25 Amol/L cisplatin for various times. Cells were
then washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped in ice-cold water, and
sonicated for 10 s. Proteins were measured by the Bradford protein assay.
Platinum content was determined by flameless atomic absorption
spectroscopy using a Zeeman apparatus with a graphite furnace (Spectra
A300, Varian) and normalized to cellular proteins.

Southwestern Analysis of 1,2 Pt-[GG] Adducts
Cells were treated with 25 Amol/L cisplatin for various times. Genomic
DNA was isolated by the use of the Nucleospin Tissue kit (Macherey-Nagel).
DNA (2 Ag) was diluted in 100 AL TE buffer (Tris-EDTA), incubated 10 min
at 94jC, and thereafter placed on ice. After the addition of 100 AL ice-cold
2 mol/L CH3CO2NH4, the sample was transferred to a positively charged nylon
membrane (Hybond plus, Amersham) by vacuum slot blotting. Thereafter, the
membrane was washed with 1 mol/L CH3CO2NH4, neutralized with 5 SSC
(saline sodium citrate), and fixed by baking the membrane for 2 h at 80jC.
Monoclonal antibodies specific for 1,2 Pt-[GG] adducts (kindly provided by
Prof. J. Thomale, Institute of Cell Biology, University of Essen Medical School,
Essen, Germany) were used at a dilution of 1:200. The additional detection
was done using monoclonal anti-rat antibodies at a dilution of 1:2,000 and the
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent from Amersham.

Acid Sphingomyelinase Assay
After treatment, HT29 cells were lysed in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X-100 and
sonicated for 10 s. Proteins were measured by the Bradford protein assay.
Reaction was started by adding to the lysate (100 AL) 100 AL of substrate
solution [choline-methyl-14C]SM [54.5 mCi/mol, 1  105 dpm per assay
(f1 nmol per assay), Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences] in 0.1% (w/v) Triton X100, 250 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), and 1 mmol/L EDTA. After a
1-h incubation at 37jC, the reaction was stopped by adding 300 AL of H2O
and 2.5 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1; v/v). Phases were separated by
centrifugation (3,000 rpm for 10 min), and the amount of released
radioactive phosphocholine was determined by subjecting 750 AL of the
upper phase to scintillation counting (Beckman LS6500, Beckman Coulter).
Each value (expressed in disintegration/min) was corrected for protein
content, and the activity of aSMase was expressed as the % of value
determined in nontreated cells.

Measurement of Intracellular pH
The intracellular pH (pHi) of HT29 cells cultured on glass coverslips was
monitored using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe carboxy-SNARF-1
(carboxy-seminaphtorhodafluor, Molecular Probes) as previously described
(29). SNARF-loaded cells were placed in a continuously perfused recording
chamber (at a temperature of 36 F 1jC) mounted on the stage of an
epifluorescent microscope (Nikon Diaphot). HT29 cells were then excited
with light at 514 nm, and fluorescence from the trapped probe was

measured at 590 and 640 nm. The emission ratio 640:590 nm (corrected for
background fluorescence) detected from intracellular SNARF was calculated
and converted to a linear pH scale using in situ calibration. Addition and
subsequent removal of NH+4 were used to induce an acid load to activate
NHE1, which is the only pHi-regulating mechanism active under our
conditions.

Results
Cisplatin treatment increases fluidity in bulk membranes as
well as in membrane lipid rafts. By using EPR spectroscopy and
12-DSA spin-labeling technique, which allows to calculate the
membrane order parameter, inversely related to membrane fluidity,
an increase in membrane fluidity was measured in HT29 cells
between 15 min and 4 h after cisplatin treatment (20). Figure 1A
confirmed that a 1-h treatment with 25 Amol/L CDDP induced
an increase in membrane fluidity in HT29 bulk membranes (i.e.,
plasma membrane and possibly endosome and lysosome membranes). In addition, by using the same methodologic approach to
study the modifications of fluidity in isolated lipid rafts, we showed
a similar decrease in the membrane order parameter of lipid rafts
purified from cisplatin-treated HT29 cells (Fig. 1A, top); this thus
suggested that the fluidity of both raft and nonraft regions of the
membrane was increased following cisplatin treatment. Note that
the membrane order parameter calculated for lipid rafts is still
greater than the one calculated for bulk membranes in both
untreated and cisplatin-treated cells, showing a more ordered lipid
environment in lipid rafts than in bulk membranes. In the next sets
of experiments, we measured the fluidity in bulk membranes.
Role of increased membrane fluidity in cisplatin-induced
apoptotic pathway. To find out whether the increase in
membrane fluidity after cisplatin treatment might underlie the
apoptotic effect of this anticancer drug, experiments were carried
out using cholesterol or GM1 ganglioside, two natural lipid
constituents of cell membranes, that have been shown to protect
rat hepatocytes against ethanol-induced apoptosis (12). Here,
30 Ag/mL cholesterol or 80 Amol/L GM1 were added 2 h before
addition of 25 Amol/L cisplatin for 1 h. Although these agents did
not significantly change the basal cell membrane fluidity, they
fully prevented the effect of cisplatin on this parameter (Fig. 1A,
bottom). We have previously shown that cisplatin induced Fas
receptor aggregation on the cell membrane of HT29 cells (26). Here,
we showed that pretreatment of HT29 cells with cholesterol or
GM1 completely blocked cisplatin-induced Fas receptor aggregation on the cell membrane (Fig. 1B). Moreover, formation of large
lipid raft aggregates was readily detectable on HT29 cells by
staining GM1 ganglioside with the fluorescein-tagged cholera toxin
(CTx-FITC) between 15 min and 4 h after the beginning of cell
treatment with 25 Amol/L cisplatin (Fig. 1C, top). The cisplatininduced lipid raft aggregation was also completely blocked by
pretreatment of HT29 cells with cholesterol (Fig. 1C, bottom).
Finally, cholesterol or GM1 pretreatment significantly inhibited
cisplatin-induced apoptosis evidenced by the decreased percentage

www.aacrjournals.org

of fragmented and condensed nuclei (Fig. 1D, top) or by the
decreased caspase-3 activity (Fig. 1D, bottom).
The inhibition of cisplatin-induced apoptosis by cholesterol or
GM1 could have been related to a decreased accumulation of
platinum in HT29 cells. To test this hypothesis, we first studied
the intracellular platinum uptake by using graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectroscopy. We showed that the accumulation of platinum in HT29 cells increased with time and did not
yet reach a plateau at a 24-h cisplatin treatment (Fig. 2A). Moreover, cholesterol or GM1 pretreatment did not modify the uptake
of platinum in HT29 cells (Fig. 2B). Finally, we measured the
time-course formation of intrastrand G-G DNA adducts (cisPt(NH3)2d(pGpG)–abbreviated 1,2 Pt-[GG]) in tumor cell DNA by
Southwestern blot analysis using the specific monoclonal antibody
R-C18 (30). The formation of 1,2 Pt-[GG] was time dependent and
increased from 1 to 12 h after the beginning of 25 Amol/L cisplatin
treatment and decreased after 48 h (Fig. 2C, left). As the platinum
uptake, the formation of 1,2 Pt-[GG] was not modified by
pretreatment of HT29 cells with cholesterol (Fig. 2C, right).
These data show for the first time that the early increase in
membrane fluidity participates in cisplatin-induced apoptosis and
facilitates the aggregation of Fas receptor and of lipid rafts on HT29
cell membrane. This alteration of membrane fluidity occurs
independently of cisplatin DNA adducts formation because the
increase in membrane fluidity was detected as soon as 15 min after
cisplatin treatment (20), whereas the formation of 1,2 Pt-[GG] was
detectable only after a 1-h treatment with cisplatin (Fig. 2C).
Mechanism of cisplatin-induced increase in membrane
fluidity. We have previously shown that cisplatin-induced
apoptosis is inhibited by imipramine, an inhibitor of aSMase, and
involves a rapid ceramide generation in HT29 cells (20); this
suggested the role of aSMase in cisplatin-induced cell death
pathway. To confirm such a role, we did RNA interference with
aSMase small interfering RNAs (siRNA) that have been shown to
decrease aSMase RNA expression in HT29 cells (31). We observed
that transient transfection with aSMase siRNAs (si aSMase)
decreased aSMase RNA expression level and cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, transfection with nonspecific
siRNAs (si GFP) neither affected cell death induction nor aSMase
RNA expression (Fig. 3A). Following these results, we studied the
kinetics of aSMase activation after treatment with 25 Amol/L
cisplatin and showed an f25% increase in aSMase activity, which
peaked within 5 to 10 min after the beginning of cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 3B, left). To look for the specificity of this enzymatic
assay, HT29 cells were preincubated for 1 h with 30 Amol/L SR,
a potent aSMase inhibitor (32) and then treated with cisplatin for
10 min. As expected, SR completely abrogated cisplatin-induced
aSMase activity (Fig. 3B, right). Because the sphingomyelin (SM) is
predominantly present in the outer leaflet of the cell membrane, we
then studied ceramide generation on the cell surface of HT29 cells
by using an anti-ceramide monoclonal antibody (15B4; ref. 20). By
fluorescence microscopy, ceramide was detected and seemed to be
aggregated on the cell membrane of HT29 cells after a 30-min
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 3C, left). Moreover, by using a flow
cytometry analysis, the anti-ceramide labeling (FL-1) increased on
the cell surface of HT29 cells after treatment with cisplatin as well
as after cell treatment with an exogenous SMase from S. aureus
(0.01 unit/mL for 30 min), which was used as a positive control
(Fig. 3C, right). We then studied the effect of S. aureus SMase on the
membrane fluidity measured by EPR in HT29 cells. The exposure of
HT29 cells to 0.01 unit/mL SMase resulted in a marked decrease of

the membrane order parameter S in a time-dependent fashion,
showing an increase in membrane fluidity (Fig. 3D, left). Finally,
pretreatment of HT29 cells with SR, an inhibitor of aSMase, blocked
cisplatin-induced increase in membrane fluidity (Fig. 3D, right).
These results suggested that the early activation of aSMase
following cisplatin treatment of HT29 cells leads to an early
increase in membrane fluidity.
Role of NHE1 in cisplatin-induced aSMase activation and in
cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Because the activity of aSMase may
be regulated by acidic pH, we measured pHi by microspectrofluorimetry using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, carboxySNARF-1, and showed a very rapid decrease of about 0.05 to 0.1 pH
unit at 5 and 15 min after cisplatin treatment in HT29 cells
(Fig. 4A, left). The cisplatin-induced acidification was prevented by
a 2-h pretreatment with cariporide, suggesting that the cytosolic
acidification was due to the inhibition of plasma membrane NHE1
by cisplatin (Fig. 4A, left). To confirm this hypothesis, we next
measured the rate of pHi recovery following an acid load induced
by an NH+4 prepulse in HT29 cells treated or not with 25 Amol/L
CDDP. As expected, the rate of pHi recovery was markedly
decreased after cisplatin exposure due to NHE1 inhibition and was
completely inhibited by 30 Amol/L cariporide (Fig. 4A, right).
Moreover, cariporide inhibited cisplatin-induced aSMase activity
(Fig. 4B, left), ceramide generation on the cell membrane (Fig. 4B,
right), as well as increase in membrane fluidity (Fig. 4C), and
significantly decreased cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 4D). Taken
together, these results pointed to NHE1 as a potential target of
cisplatin in HT29 cells, responsible for early intracellular acidification with consequences on aSMase activity and, hence, on
membrane fluidity.
PS120 Chinese hamster fibroblast cell lines expressing or not an
active form of NHE1 were used to confirm the role of NHE1 as a
potential target of cisplatin. Firstly, we showed that NHE1-PS120
cells were more sensitive than PS120 cells to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis (Fig. 5A). As expected, an increase in membrane fluidity
was only detected in NHE1-PS120 cells following cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 5B). Moreover, pretreatment of NHE1-PS120 cells

with SR prevented the increase in fluidity induced by cisplatin
treatment (Fig. 5C). Finally, cisplatin-induced apoptosis in NHE1PS120 cells was reduced by the pretreatment of cells with SR or
cariporide (Fig. 5D). Altogether, these data strongly supported that
cisplatin induces a very early NHE1-dependent intracellular
acidification leading to aSMase activity and increase in membrane
fluidity.
Cariporide and cholesterol also inhibited cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in two other human colon cancer cell lines HCT116
and SW480. HCT116 and SW480 were pretreated with cariporide
or cholesterol for 2 h before cisplatin treatment. In agreement
with results obtained in HT29 cells, cariporide and cholesterol
pretreatment also reduced cisplatin-induced apoptosis in these cell
lines (Fig. 6), thus suggesting that inhibition of NHE1 or membrane
fluidification might be common early plasma membrane events
involved in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in human colon cancer
cells.

Discussion
In this study, we showed for the first time that, in vitro, cisplatin
treatment induced a rapid increase in fluidity measured by EPR
spectroscopy in bulk membranes as well as in isolated lipid rafts in
HT29 human colon cancer cells. Pretreatment with membrane
stabilizers (cholesterol or GM1) totally inhibited the increase in
membrane fluidity induced by cisplatin, but also the aggregation of
lipid rafts and of Fas receptor on cell membrane; thus, this
suggested for the first time a role of increased membrane fluidity
in the reorganization of certain plasma membrane components in
HT29 cells following cisplatin treatment. Until now, such variations
of membrane fluidity were supposed to induce a mobility of the
membrane components and a reorganization of membrane
proteins and/or lipid rafts likely leading to the modulation of
many cellular functions (33). Our data support these hypotheses

both untreated and cisplatin-treated HT29 cells. This suggested
that the membrane of cisplatin-treated cells may still be organized
in less fluid-state domains similar to lipid rafts evidenced by CTxFITC staining of GM1, a constituent of membrane microdomains.

including response to cancer therapy (34). However, the molecular
mechanisms involved in alterations of membrane fluidity upon drug
exposure require definition; such alterations could involve membrane-drug interaction, modification of membrane lipid composition, membrane lipid peroxidation, cytoskeleton alteration, or
activation of sphingomyelinases such as the acid sphingomyelinase

(aSMase; refs. 12, 35). Our present study confirmed that aSMase was
involved in cisplatin-induced apoptosis because decreased expression of aSMase by RNA interference (31) significantly reduced
cisplatin-induced apoptosis in HT29 cells. Moreover, cisplatin
induced an early aSMase activation in the first 15 min following
the onset of cisplatin treatment and, subsequently, the generation of

ceramide at the plasma membrane. Both these events were totally
prevented by pretreatment of HT29 cells with SR, a potent inhibitor
of aSMase (32). These results corroborate our previous data and
other data showing a rapid hydrolysis of sphingomyelin into
ceramide and the formation of ceramide-enriched membrane
domains upon cisplatin, irradiation, or UV treatment (ref. 20; for a
review, see ref. 21).
Recently, it has been reported that SMase activity had several
effects on membrane architecture (increased membrane permeability, membrane aggregation, and fusion; refs. 36, 37). Treatment
with exogenous sphingomyelinase that decreased cholesterol
content in crude plasma membrane has been shown to increase
membrane fluidity in preadipocytes (38) and a decrease in
cholesterol in detergent-resistant membrane fractions has been
described in rat astrocytes treated with SMase (39). Finally,
ceramide displaces cholesterol from lipid rafts in both model
membranes (40) and cells (41). These data led us to investigate the
relationship between aSMase activation and the increase in
membrane fluidity following cisplatin treatment in HT29 cells.
Firstly, we observed that the treatment of HT29 cells with an
exogenous S. aureus sphingomyelinase induced an increase in

membrane fluidity. Moreover, pretreatment with SR also prevented
the increase in membrane fluidity induced by cisplatin. Altogether,
these data suggest for the first time that cisplatin-induced increase
in membrane fluidity was dependent on aSMase activation. It is
noteworthy that staurosporine-induced apoptosis is independent
of aSMase activation in several cell types, including HT29 (20, 42,
43), and was not related to change in membrane fluidity in HT29
cells (data not shown).
At present, little is known about the molecular mechanisms
involved in cisplatin-induced aSMase activation. Although the
enzyme activity reaches an optimum at acidic pH, the full activity
of the enzyme at the cell surface is achieved even at neutral pH
values (44). Here, we show that in HT29 cells, cisplatin induced a
rapid intracellular acidification due to an inhibition of membrane
NHE1 protein. Cariporide, an inhibitor of NHE1, completely
prevented cisplatin-induced intracellular acidification as well as
the related aSMase activation, ceramide generation, and membrane
fluidification, thus pointing to a role of intracellular acidification in
aSMase activation.
In tumors, the transmembrane pH gradient is reversed, leading
to a more acidic extracellular environment and a more alkaline

intracellular medium (45). Besides, it has been shown that cancer
cells had a constitutively higher pHi than normal cells as a result of
increased activity of NHE1. Because the inhibition of NHE1 can
induce apoptosis specifically in cancer cells, NHE1 inhibitors have
been considered as potential antitumor agents (46). Accordingly,
we observed that transient transfection with specific siRNA NHE1
induced apoptosis in HT29 cells (data not shown); however,
transient inhibition of NHE1 by cariporide for 2 h did not induce
apoptosis in human colon cancer cells, but significantly reduced
cisplatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role of this membrane
exchanger in this cell death pathway. Employing Chinese hamster
fibroblast cell lines NHE1-PS120 and PS120 that expressed or
lacked, respectively, an active NHE1, we firmly confirm a role of
NHE1 in cell sensitivity to cisplatin by showing that cisplatininduced apoptosis was increased in NHE1-PS120 cells and was
dependent on both NHE1 and aSMase. Moreover, cisplatin elicited
a SR-sensitive increase in membrane fluidity only in NHE1-PS120
cells. Altogether, these data suggest that NHE1 may be another
potential target of cisplatin.

The molecular mechanism involved in NHE1 inhibition by
cisplatin is yet unknown, but seems to be independent of cisplatininduced DNA adduct formation because this inhibition occurred
very rapidly (5 min after the onset of cisplatin treatment) and
before formation of 1,2 Pt-[GG] adducts (detectable at 1 h of
treatment with cisplatin). Indeed, NHE1 inhibition by cisplatin
might stem from a direct interaction of the drug with the
exchanger because cisplatin could bind to nucleophilic amino acid
residues in proteins, including cysteine, methionine, and histidine.
Additionally, cisplatin-induced NHE1 inhibition might result from
the inhibition of the Na+, K+ ATPase activity by binding this
enzyme through lipid carbonyl group (47) or by preventing the
formation of a phospho-intermediate of the enzyme (48). A key to
the understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in this
inhibition might be the observation that NHE-1 inhibition by
cisplatin elicits completely different effects than NHE-1 inhibition
by a competitive inhibitor, cariporide, or than the absence of this
transporter in PS120 cells. This might constitute an area worthy of
investigation for future studies. Nevertheless, in the field of cell
response to cisplatin, our data suggest that NHE1 might be another
potential cellular target of cisplatin in human colon cancer cells,
and that cisplatin treatment may be more potent in tumors having
a high basal NHE1 activity (49).
In conclusion, it has been shown that cisplatin-induced
apoptosis depends on cisplatin interactions with DNA (3) and
also, more recently, on interactions with mitochondrial DNA and
voltage-dependent anion channel protein in the mitochondrial
membrane (50). Our data now suggest that the inhibition of the
exchanger NHE1 at the plasma membrane level may also play a role
in the cytotoxicity of this agent, notably by activating acid
sphingomyelinase and increasing membrane fluidity. Altogether,
these findings may serve to define new therapeutic strategies based
on cisplatin therapy, taking into account the activity status of NHE1
in human cancers.
