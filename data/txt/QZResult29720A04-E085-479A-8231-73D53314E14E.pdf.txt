Abstract
This study identifies a novel cross-talk paradigm between the
type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) and
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in colon cancer
cells. IGF1R activation by ligand exposure in growth factor–
deprived cells induces Akt activation in the FET, CBS, and GEO
colon cancer cell lines. Investigation of IGF1R-mediated
signaling pathways using small interfering RNA approaches
indicated that, as expected, phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase
(PI3K) was activated by IGF1R. Mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) activity as reflected by phospho-extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK) induction was not significantly
activated until later times following release of these cells from
growth factor deprivation stress. The appearance of phosphoERK was proximal to EGFR activation. Treatment of cells with
the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 before release from stress
resulted in a concentration-dependent loss of EGFR activation, whereas treatment with the MAPK inhibitor PD98059 did
not block EGFR activation, indicating that EGFR activation
was downstream of the IGF1R/PI3K pathway. PD98059
inhibition of MAPK was associated with a concentrationdependent reduction in EGFR-mediated phospho-ERK. EGFR
inhibitor blocked induction of phospho-ERK, showing that
MAPK activity was a consequence of EGFR-mediated signaling. On the other hand, a small-molecule IGF1R inhibitor,
PQIP, blocked Akt phosphorylation. The divergent signaling
functions of IGF1R and EGFR suggested the potential for
synergism by a combination of therapy directed at the two
receptors. Combination treatment with PQIP and EGFR
inhibitor Tarceva resulted in synergistic effects as indicated
by combination index analysis in all three cell lines tested.

Introduction
The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) signaling
pathway is an important growth-regulatory pathway that is
prevalent in a variety of cancer types, including colon cancer
(1–3). Both IGF1 and insulin are capable of binding and activating
the IGF1R. Ligand binding induces receptor autophosphorylation

at the tyrosine kinase domains, which in turn phosphorylates the
tyrosine residues on various substrates and adaptor proteins (4).
Two of the key substrates of the IGF1R are the insulin receptor
substrate 1 (IRS1) and the src homology collagen-like (Shc) docking
protein. When IRS1 is phosphorylated, it can recruit other signaling
messengers, including phosphatidylinositol 3¶-kinase (PI3K), leading to downstream activation of diverse signaling cascades. The
IGF1R can also activate Shc protein, which leads to the activation
of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). The PI3K and
MAPK influence key cell survival and proliferation events (2, 3, 5, 6).
Previous work had shown that IGF1R activation is crucial for the
mitogenic and transforming activity of the epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR; ref. 7). However, it was not clear whether IGF1R
was upstream or downstream of EGFR in this cooperative
relationship (8). We determined that the IGF1R was upstream of
EGFR during mitogenesis and mediated cell cycle reentry from a
quiescent state through the induction of transforming growth
factor a (TGFa)-mediated activation of the EGFR (9).
The FET colon carcinoma cell line is derived from an early-stage
colon tumor. This cell line is poorly tumorigenic, well differentiated, and has been characterized as growth factor dependent
because FET cells require exogenous growth factor supplementation, including transferrin and insulin, in serum-free medium for
proliferation (10–13). Previous studies showed that the mitogenicity of insulin (at the concentrations used) in cultures of these cells
is not through the insulin receptor but instead through the IGF1R.
Moreover, IGF1R activation led to the subsequent activation of the
EGFR, which then stimulated reentry into the cell cycle by cells in
G0 (14). A similar dependence on IGF1R activation has been shown
for CBS and GEO cell lines as well.
Major signaling pathways activated by the IGF1R and EGFR
include the PI3K and MAPK pathways. Because these receptors
seem to be so similar in their signaling mechanisms, it was of
interest to study their cooperative mechanism in more detail.
Previous studies had not addressed the signaling mechanisms
underlying this cooperative relationship between the two receptors.
Consequently, we asked whether they activate the same pathways
in the context of cross-talk, thereby contributing to the overall
amplitude of signaling, or whether they stimulated different
pathways that contributed to different cellular functions. Here,
we show that inhibition of the IGF1R-mediated activation of the
PI3K pathway results in the inhibition of EGFR activation. The
MAPK pathway does not seem to be directly involved with the
activation of IGF1R. However, IGF1R has an indirect role in
the activation of the MAPK pathway as MAPK is dependent on
EGFR signaling in these cells. Moreover, MAPK is a key determinant of the biological effect of the IGF1R and EGFR cross-talk as

Cross-talk between IGF1R and EGFR Involves PI3K

EGFR-mediated MAPK activity is required for DNA synthesis in
this group of cell lines. Moreover, a combination of IGF1R and
EGFR inhibition achieved synergy of growth inhibition in all three
cell lines.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. The human colon carcinoma cell lines were originally
developed from primary tumors and have been extensively characterized
(10–14). Cells are maintained in a chemically defined serum-free medium
consisting of McCoy’s 5A medium (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with
amino acids, pyruvate, vitamins, antibiotics, and the growth factors
transferrin (4 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and insulin (20 Ag/mL; Sigma-Aldrich)
and EGF (10 ng/mL; R&D Systems). Supplemented McCoy’s medium (‘‘SM’’)
is McCoy’s 5A medium supplemented with antibiotics and nutrients but
lacking any growth factors. ‘‘TI’’ medium is SM plus transferrin and insulin,
whereas the normal culture medium (‘‘TIE’’ or ‘‘SF’’) is TI medium plus EGF.
FET cells were adapted to TI medium. Cultures were maintained at 37jC in
a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells were routinely subcultured with
a 0.25% trypsin (Invitrogen) in Joklik’s medium (Invitrogen) containing
0.1% EDTA.
Antibodies, immunoblot, and immunoprecipitation. Anti-EGFR
polyclonal, anti-phospho-EGFR Y1173, anti-PI3K (p85), anti-IRS1 polyclonal,
anti-IGF1Rh polyclonal, anti-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
polyclonal, and anti-phospho-ERK monoclonal antibodies were from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phospho-IGF1R antibody (15) was obtained from
Calbiochem. Anti-phosphotyrosine RC-20 antibody ( for Western blot) and
anti-phosphotyrosine PY20 monoclonal antibody ( for immunoprecipitation) were from BD Biosciences. Anti-phospho-EGFR Y1068 and Y1086,
anti-phospho-Akt Ser473, anti-Akt polyclonal, anti-activated p38, and anticaspase-7 polyclonal antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.
Anti-actin and anti-tubulin antibodies were from Sigma-Aldrich. Immunoblot and immunoprecipitation were carried out as previously described (16).
Cell lysate preparation. Cultured colon carcinoma cells (FET, GEO, and
CBS) were allowed to grow to 80% to 90% confluence in 100-mm culture
plates or, in the case of inhibitor studies, six-well tissue culture plates. The
medium was changed to SM medium and the cells were made quiescent
through nutrient and growth factor deprivation for 5 d. Cells were then
released in TI/TIE medium (growth factor and nutrient replenishment) or
SM (nutrient replenishment alone) and harvested at various time points as
indicated in the figures. In inhibitor studies, cells were treated with various
concentrations of inhibitors on release from quiescence and were harvested
at the time points indicated in the figures for dose-response studies. Cells
were washed in PBS and collected in lysis buffer [50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4),
100 mmol/L NaCl, 1% NP40, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.1% SDS, 50 mmol/L NaF,
10 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 25 Ag/mL
h-glycerophosphate, and one protease inhibitor cocktail tablet from Roche].
Crude cell lysates were passed through a 21-gauge needle to shear DNA and
lysed for 30 min at 4jC. Cell lysates were then cleared by centrifugation at
21,000 rpm for 15 min at 4jC and protein concentrations were determined
by the Pierce bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce Biotechnology).
[3H]thymidine incorporation assay (mitogenesis). Confluent FET cells
were growth arrested by growth factor and nutrient deprivation for 5 d in
SM medium and subsequently released from growth arrest by providing
fresh nutrients (SM) or nutrients and growth factors (TI). Cells were pulsed
for 1 h with 25 ACi [3H]thymidine (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences). The free
thymidine was removed and the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS.
Trichloroacetic acid was added and the precipitated radioactivity was
solubilized in 0.2 mol/L NaOH solution. Radioactive incorporation into DNA
was then determined (17). For inhibition of mitogenesis studies, cells were
treated with various concentrations of inhibitors at the time of release from
quiescence. Cells were then pulsed and assayed for radioactive incorporation as described above.
IGF1R small interfering RNA transfection and knockdown of p110A
protein using small interfering RNA. Silencer validated IGF1R small
interfering RNA (siRNA) was obtained from Ambion, whereas the PIK3CA

www.aacrjournals.org

SMARTpool consisting of four siRNA duplexes (18) was used against
PIK3CA, and the scrambled control siRNA was from Qiagen. FET cells were
plated in antibiotic-free ‘‘10F’’ medium [supplemental McCoy medium
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech, Inc.)] at a density of 200,000
per well in six-well plates. The cells were allowed to attach overnight. 10F
media were changed once 30 min before transfection. The transfection was
carried out using Lipofectamine 2000 from Invitrogen and was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The plates were washed once
with TI medium 5 h after transfection and replenished with TI medium. The
culture media (TI) were changed again after 48 h. The cell lysates were
collected 72 h after transfection.
DNA fragmentation assay (Cell Death Detection ELISA). FET cells
were plated at a density of 10,000 per well in SF medium in 96-well plates
and allowed to attach overnight at 37jC. The cells were changed to TI
medium 24 h later and treated with either PD98059 or LY294002 at the
indicated concentrations for another 72 h at 37jC. DNA fragmentation was
detected by the Roche Cell Death Detection ELISA kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (Roche).
Cell proliferation inhibition assay. Cell proliferation was evaluated by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma)
assay as described earlier (19). Briefly, FET, GEO, and CBS cells were seeded
in 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar) at 8,000 per well per 100 AL. Cells
were allowed to attach overnight and then treated with 100 AL serial
concentrations of PQIP, Tarceva, and the combination of PQIP plus Tarceva
at constant ratios indicated in the text. After 72 h of drug exposure at 37jC,
MTT solution (50 AL, 2 mg/mL) was added to each well. The reaction was
stopped by removal of MTT after 2 h of incubation at 37jC. DMSO (150 AL)
was added to dissolve formazan crystals. Absorbance at 570 nm was
recorded using a 96-well plate reader.
Combination index value analysis. The combination index (CI) was
determined by the Chou and Talalay method, a well-established mathematical analysis to determine the pharmacologic interaction between two
drugs (20). The CI value of nonexclusive drugs is calculated by the following
formula:
CI ¼ ðDa þ DbÞ=ðDxa þ DxbÞ þ DaDb=DxaDxb
where Da and Db are the doses of drug A and B that inhibit X% of cell
proliferation as single drugs, and Dxa and Dxb are doses of drug A and B
that inhibit X% of cell growth in a combination regimen. CI = 1 indicates an
additive effect of the two drugs and the CI formula is the same as a
traditional isobologram equation. Synergism is defined as more than the
expected additive effect yielding a CI < 1, whereas antagonism has a CI > 1.
CI values were analyzed using CalcuSyn software (Biosoft) and previously
described (19, 21). Inputs for the equation below are the concentrations of
single inhibitors, the combination doses at fixed ratios, and the fractional
inhibition [fraction affected (Fa)] of single drugs and combinations. The
equation is given by Fa = (A570 control  A570 treated)/A570 control, whereas
the fraction of unaffected cells (Fu) = 1  Fa.

Results
PI3K is downstream of the IGF1R-mediated induction of
TGFA in colon carcinoma cells. FET cells were growth arrested
by nutrient and growth factor deprivation as described in Materials
and Methods. IGF1R expression levels remain constant during
growth arrest and do not differ after release from growth arrest by
TI medium. However, the IGF1R is activated within 5 min of release
from quiescence by TI. On the other hand, the activation of the
EGFR is not significantly induced until 1 h after TI release from
growth arrest (Fig. 1A). This observation was consistent with
previous studies showing that EGFR expression was not observed
until this time point (9, 14).
In contrast to release from growth arrest by TI medium, release
in medium without an IGF1R ligand (insulin in this study) results in
only modest DNA synthesis and does not result in the activation of

Figure 1. Receptor signaling activation after TI release. A, detection of IGF1R and EGFR activation after release: FET cells were starved for 5 d in growth factor–null
medium and then stimulated to reenter the cell cycle by addition of medium containing transferrin and insulin (TI) for 5, 30, and 60 min as indicated. Lysates were

activation on TI release from quiescence: lysates collected after TI release from quiescence were subjected to SDS-PAGE and blotted for phospho-Akt (P-Akt ) antibody.
The blot was stripped in stripping buffer [62.5 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 100 mmol/L h-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 30 min at 50jC] and reblotted for Akt antibody.

the IGF1R (9, 13). This indicates that IGF1R plays an important role
in the regulation of cell cycle reentry in FET cells. We next
investigated IGF1R-mediated signaling pathways involved in this
function. To determine the mechanism by which the IGF1R

stimulates autocrine TGFa (9), activation kinetics of two key
signaling pathways activated by the IGF1R (PI3K and MAPK
pathways) were determined. A dramatic increase in Akt phosphorylation was detected after release from quiescence (Fig. 1A).

Figure 3. Inhibition of MAPK activation by MEK inhibitor PD98059. A, the mitogenesis assay was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Similar to
LY294002 treatment, FET cells were treated with increasing concentrations of PD98059. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. B, quiescent cells were treated with various
concentrations of PD98059 as indicated for 30 min before TI release (60 min) and the lysates obtained were analyzed for the activation of ERK, p38, and EGFR.
C and D, contributions of PI3K and MAPK pathways to cell survival: FET cells were seeded at 10,000 per well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight.
The next day, media were changed to TI medium and cells were treated with either PD98059 (1, 3, 6, and 10 Amol/L) or LY294002 (10, 20, 25, and 35 Amol/L) as
described in Materials and Methods. C, Death Detection ELISA assays were performed and absorbance was measured at 405 nm. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD.
D, quiescent FET cells were treated with either PD98059 (1, 3, 6, and 10 Amol/L) or LY294002 (10, 20, 25, and 35 Amol/L) with TI release and whole-cell lysates
were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with caspase-7 antibody. Anti-tubulin antibody was used as a loading control.

Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of IRS1, an IGF1R substrate,
and the p85 subunit of the PI3K indicated an increase of IRS1-p85
complex formation after 5 min of release in TI medium (Fig. 1B).
These lines of evidence indicate that PI3K is downstream of IGF1R
activation. This phenomenon is not restricted to the FET cell line
model as we observed similar IGF1R/Akt activation after 5 min of
release in TI medium in growth-arrested CBS (Fig. 1C) and GEO
(data not shown) cells. Unlike the kinetics of PI3K activation, very
little MAPK activity (as reflected by ERK activation) was observed
until 1 h after TI release (Fig. 1D). This time point corresponds to
the time at which the EGFR is significantly activated, suggesting
that the bulk of MAPK activity observed may be a consequence of

www.aacrjournals.org

EGFR signaling and that IGF1R was not significantly contributing
directly to the MAPK activation.
Inhibition of PI3K pathway blocks EGFR activation. FET cells
were treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 to block the PI3K
pathway (22). Mitogenesis assays of LY294002-treated cells showed
that 25 Amol/L LY294002 inhibited DNA synthesis to levels
comparable with those observed on release in the absence of
insulin (SM; Fig. 2A). We used the loss of Akt activation as a marker
of PI3K pathway blockade because this molecule is downstream of
PI3K. Because robust EGFR activation begins at 60 min following
TI release, we performed the assays at this time point.

LY294002 similar to that of inhibition of mitogenesis was observed
(Fig. 2B).
If the PI3K pathway is involved in the IGF1R-mediated induction
of EGFR activation, then inhibition of this pathway should block
the activation of the EGFR. To test this hypothesis, we used two
approaches. First, we treated cells with LY294002 and assayed for
EGFR activation. We found that treatment of LY294002 results in
the inhibition of EGFR activation (Fig. 2B). We also performed
transfection of siRNA to the p110a subunit of PI3K in FET cells.
The transfection knocked down PIK3CA protein expression,
resulting in down-regulation of phospho-Akt and inhibition of
EGFR activation (Fig. 2C). Thus, the activation of the PI3K pathway

is required for the induction of EGFR activation during mitogenesis.
Inhibition of MAPK pathway does not affect EGFR activation. To block the activation of the MAPK pathway, we used the
MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor PD98059 (23). We first
performed a mitogenesis assay to determine the suitability of the
concentrations selected. Figure 3A shows that 6 to 10 Amol/L of
PD98059 inhibit DNA synthesis to SM levels. Treatment of FET cells
with PD98059 also resulted in a concentration-dependent inhibition of ERK activity at 1 h after release from growth arrest (Fig. 3B).
We determined the effect of PD98059 on p38, a protein closely
related to MAPK, to ensure selectivity for the ERK pathway.

Figure 4. Inhibition of EGFR by AG1478 blocks MAPK activation. A, the mitogenesis assay was performed as described in Materials and Methods. Quiescent FET
cells were treated with increasing concentrations of AG1478 as indicated. Columns, mean (n = 3); bars, SD. B, cells were treated with various concentrations of
AG1478 for 30 min before TI release (60 min) and the lysates were incubated with the EGFR antibody. The antibody-antigen complex was then precipitated with protein
A-agarose and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with the phosphotyrosine antibody RC-20. EGFR activation was also detected by using an
anti-phospho-EGFR Y1173 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). C, lysates were also analyzed for the activation of ERK, p38, and Akt. IGF1R phosphorylation
was measured either by an anti-phospho-IGF1R antibody (shown) or by incubating cell lysates with PY20 antibody and the immunocomplex was then precipitated with
protein A-agarose and resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by IGF1R immunoblotting (data not shown). D, inhibition of IGF1R activation down-regulated
phospho-Akt: quiescent cells were treated with 1 Amol/L PQIP for 30 min before TI release (60 min) and the lysates obtained were analyzed for the activation of IGF1R
and Akt. Total Akt was also used as a loading control. FET cells were transfected with IGF1R siRNA to down-regulate IGF1R as described in Materials and Methods.
Lysates were analyzed for IGF1R and the activation of IGF1R and Akt. Actin was used as a loading control. PQIP does not block EGFR phosphorylation in
EGF-stimulated cells: cells were treated with 1 Amol/L PQIP for 30 min before TIE release (60 min) and the lysates obtained were analyzed for the activation of IGF1R
and EGFR. Actin was used as a loading control. N, no change. Tarceva fails to affect IGF1R signaling: cells were treated with 1 Amol/L Tarceva for 30 min and the
lysates obtained were analyzed for the activation of EGFR and IGF1R.

*IC50 values were determined from MTT data after 72 h of drug treatment by CalcuSyn software. Representative data of two repeated experiments were
shown here.

PD98059 was selective for the ERK pathway as it did not inhibit p38
activation at the concentrations used (Fig. 3B). The role of the
MAPK pathway in EGFR activation was then investigated with
PD98059 treatment. The result shows that PD98059 does not
inhibit EGFR activation (Fig. 3B). These data indicated that the
MAPK pathway is not involved in the regulation of the EGFR
activation.
PI3K pathway participates in cell survival. Because IGF1Rregulated PI3K activates EGFR through TGFa (9), and MAPK
activation is subsequent to the activation of EGFR during
mitogenesis, this raises the question of the function of the two
receptors and the pathways activated by them. To address this
issue, we performed DNA fragmentation assays and found that the
selective PI3K inhibitor LY294002 induced apoptosis in FET cells
grown in TI medium. Inhibition of activated Akt by 25 Amol/L
LY294002 resulted in approximately a 5-fold increase of apoptosis
as reflected by DNA fragmentation assays. On the other hand, MEK
inhibition by PD98059 resulted in a more modest 2-fold induction
of apoptosis (Fig. 3C). Caspase-7 cleavage assays confirmed that
both inhibitors increased apoptosis in FET cells released in TI
medium after growth factor deprivation stress (Fig. 3D). Thus,
whereas PI3K plays a dominant role in cell survival, the MAPK
pathway elicited by IGF1R-mediated EGFR activation also participates in the support of cell survival signaling.
Inhibition of EGFR blocks MAPK activation. The MAPK
activation studies showed that ERK activation occurs at f60 min
following growth factor addition. This coincides with robust EGFR
activation (Fig. 1). Taken together with the finding that inhibition
of MEK does not inhibit EGFR activation (Fig. 3B ), we
hypothesized that MAPK activation is derived from EGFR
activation. To test this, we treated FET cells with AG1478, a
selective EGFR inhibitor that has been widely used as a tool in
studying EGFR-mediated signal transduction (24–26). Cells were
treated with various concentrations of AG1478 before release from
quiescence. Figure 4A shows that at 0.5 Amol/L AG1478 inhibited
the DNA synthesis of FET cells in TI medium. As observed in
Fig. 4B, this concentration of AG1478 also blocks the activation of
the EGFR at 1 h of release. We then treated FET cells with AG1478
and determined its effects on ERK activation at 1 h after release
from growth arrest. AG1478 inhibited the activation of ERK that
was observed at 1 h of release in TI in the absence of the inhibitor
(Fig. 4C). This shows that MAPK activity is downstream of EGFR
activation. AG1478 treatment did not affect the activation of p38
in this cell line (Fig. 4C). We assessed whether AG1478 treatment

www.aacrjournals.org

was inhibiting IGF1R activation. Again in Fig. 4C, the result shows
the activation of IGF1R at 60 min of TI release in the presence of
0 to 5 Amol/L of AG1478. As expected, AG1478 does not affect
IGF1R activation, thereby indicating selective effects on this
tyrosine kinase receptor.
We next tested the role of EGFR on the activation of the PI3K
pathway components. Figure 4C shows the lack of effect of AG1478
treatment on activated Akt levels. AG1478 does not show any
inhibition of phospho-Akt at 0.5 Amol/L treatment, the concentration of the drug at which EGFR activation and DNA synthesis are
inhibited. Moreover, higher AG1478 concentrations (5–20 Amol/L)
did not inhibit activated IGF1R nor Akt phosphorylation but did
effectively block ERK activation (data not shown), further
indicating that PI3K/Akt axis plays a role downstream of IGF1R,
whereas the MAPK pathway is under EGFR control in this cell line
and is necessary for reentry into the cell cycle as reflected by
indication of DNA synthesis.
Inhibition of IGF1R activation blocks Akt phosphorylation.
Akt activation correlates with IGF1R activation after TI release
described earlier in this study (Fig. 1). If PI3K activation is
downstream of IGF1R, inhibition of IGF1R activation would result
in blockade of Akt phosphorylation. To address this issue, we used
two approaches. First, we used an IGF1R kinase inhibitor, PQIP (27),
to inhibit IGF1R activation. PQIP (1 Amol/L) effectively inhibited
IGF1R phosphorylation in FET cells released in TI medium, and the
drug inhibited Akt phosphorylation as well (Fig. 4D, top left).
However, this compound does not block EGFR phosphorylation
in EGF-stimulated cells, confirming its specificity for IGF1R
(Fig. 4D, bottom left). We next used IGF1R siRNA transfection to
down-regulate IGF1R protein in FET cells. IGF1R siRNA effectively
reduced IGF1R protein and activation level. Activation of Akt was
also inhibited (Fig. 4D, top right), further indicating that PI3K/Akt
axis is a downstream pathway of IGF1R in FET cells.
Growth inhibition of colon carcinoma cells by combination
treatment of PQIP and Tarceva. Given the differences in function
between IGF1R- and EGFR-activated pathways, we hypothesized
that inhibition of both IGF1R and EGFR activation in colon cancer
cells would be synergistic. We first determined the growthinhibitory effects of PQIP, an IGF1R kinase inhibitor, and Tarceva
(erlotinib; ref. 28), an EGFR kinase inhibitor, in colon cancer cells.
Treatment of colon cancer cell lines FET, CBS, and GEO confirms
that Tarceva fails to affect IGF1R signaling (Fig. 4D, bottom right).
Drug concentrations and growth-inhibitory effects were analyzed
by CalcuSyn software (Biosoft). IC50 values of PQIP and Tarceva

comparison with single drugs. Bottom right, CIs of PQIP + Tarceva at 1:9 (FET), 1:10 (CBS), and 1:2 (GEO) ratios were tested by CI analysis. CI value was analyzed by

median-effect plot as well as a dose-effect curve (Fig. 5A). The
median-effect plot shows the linear relationship between the ratio
of the Fa to the Fu, where Fu = 1  Fa, and drug concentrations are
in log values. IC50 values of single drugs or the combination
regimens can be determined from the X-axis intersection value of
the lines, where log (Fa/Fu) = 0. We observed a concentrationdependent inhibition of cell growth in both PQIP and Tarceva
treatments alone as shown in the dose-effect curve. The shapes of
the curves were different for PQIP and Tarceva, which reflected the
different slopes in the median-effect plot. In both the median-effect
plot and the dose-effect curve, the combination treatment of PQIP
and Tarceva showed a parallel shift to the left in comparison with
the single drugs when the inhibitory effect of combinations was
plotted against the concentration of each drug. This indicated
higher sensitivity of FET cells to the combination treatment than to
the single drugs. Significantly, 11- and 15-fold decreases in the
concentrations of PQIP and Tarceva, respectively, were sufficient
for 50% inhibition of tumor cell proliferation at the 1:9 ratio
combination compared with the IC50 value of either drug alone
(Table 1). Moreover, the isobologram showed that the combination
of PQIP plus Tarceva achieved more than an additive effect, as all of
the data points from combinations fell below the line defined from
the concentrations of single agents at 90% (ED90), 75% (ED75), and
50% (ED50) inhibition, respectively (Fig. 5A). To further determine
whether the inhibitory effects of targeting both IGF1R and EGFR
kinase activity by the combination of PQIP plus Tarceva were
synergistic, we analyzed the CI values of PQIP plus Tarceva using
CalcuSyn software (Materials and Methods). Synergism (CI < 1) was
observed at the combination concentrations used with a PQIP/
Tarceva ratio of 1:9 (Fig. 5A). In fact, a strong synergistic effect
(CI < 0.3) was determined at all combination concentrations tested

in FET cells. Synergistic results were also observed in CBS and GEO
cell lines (Table 1; Fig. 5B and C).

Discussion
Previously, we found that to obtain substantial reentry into the
cell cycle from growth arrest in FET colon cancer cells, exogenous
activation of IGF1R was necessary. The induction of autocrine
TGFa-mediated EGFR activation in the G1 phase of the cell cycle is
an essential event for DNA synthesis in these cells, and the upregulation of EGFR via the autocrine production of TGFa is an event
lying downstream of the activation of the IGF1R (9, 14). TGFa was
one of the first stimulatory growth factors to be described as having
autocrine activity (29). The autocrine hypothesis was proposed to
explain the growth advantage of malignant cells over their normal
counterparts. Since the formulation of this hypothesis, it has
become evident that normal cells show autocrine activities as well
(30). Normal cells do not exhibit independence from exogenous
growth factors for cell cycle reentry nor do they exhibit constitutive
cell survival signaling in quiescence. The major growth advantage
resulting from autocrine TGFa mediated by IGF1R activation here
may be an enhanced ability to reenter the cell cycle from growth
arrest in response to IGF1R ligands and to survive to conditions that
are not growth permissive.
Earlier studies in Balb/3T3 cells have suggested that IGF1R
activation is critical for cell cycle reentry and that the role of EGFR
signaling is to produce sufficient IGF1R (7, 31). However, FET colon
carcinoma cells present a novel cross-talk paradigm in which it is
the TGFa/EGFR that is required for induction of mitogenesis,
whereas IGF1R signaling leads to the activation of EGFR (9, 14).
Another cross-talk paradigm has been shown between these two

receptors in COS7 cells. This example of cross-talk is mediated by
autocrine heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF; ref. 32). Activation of the
IGF1R leads to EGFR activation via a mechanism involving matrix
metalloproteinase–dependent release of HB-EGF in these cells.
Thus, it seems that IGF1R-mediated EGFR activation can occur
through the induction of a variety of EGFR ligands, and the crosstalk between IGF1R and EGFR shows great versatility in different
cell lines.
Although the existence of cross-talk between IGF1R and EGFR
has been described previously in the FET cell line (9, 14), the
signaling pathways mediated by the IGF1R involved in this crosstalk had not been determined. Here, it has been shown for the first
time that IGF1R-mediated EGFR activation through the induction
of an autocrine TGFa loop is critically dependent on the activation
of the PI3K pathway. This study also elucidates the signaling
function of EGFR in the cross-talk. The delayed activation of the
EGFR and MAPK pathway by TGFa induction may provide these
cells with a mechanism for sustained cell survival signaling
following an initial pulse of IGF1R-mediated PI3K activity. This
initial burst of PI3K signaling provides the major survival support
for the FET cells for escape from stress effects. MAPK also plays an
important role in cell cycle reentry.
Our previous work indicated that either EGFR or ErbB2 can compensate for the inhibition of the other receptor when exposed to a
single drug treatment with small-molecule antagonists (16, 19, 21). In
contrast, targeting both receptors simultaneously provided synergistic effects with induction of apoptosis (16, 19). Interestingly,
recent evidence also suggests a role for IGF1R signaling in the
acquired resistance to drugs against EGFR or ErbB2. For example,
IGF1R signaling has been reported to interfere with the growthinhibitory action of the anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (33, 34), and a correlation between IGF1R activation and
acquired resistance to EGFR blockade was also shown (35, 36). In
another study, coinhibition of EGFR and IGF1R sensitized human
malignant glioma cells to CD95L-induced apoptosis (37). Thus, the
strategy of targeting both IGF1R and EGFR to overcome acquired
drug resistance would seem to have intriguing potential for human
cancer therapy.
The presence of cross-talk between two potential therapeutic
targets (EGFR and IGF1R) may be of particular importance in
cancer therapy. Clinically applicable drugs against EGFR have been
developed and inhibitors targeting IGF1R are emerging as well
(15, 27, 38–44). Single drugs directed at molecular targets have had
disappointing effect in the clinic (45). The tight interplay between

IGF1R and EGFR signaling suggests that strategies against both
receptors may be of value (37, 46–48). A recent study found that
stimulation of head and neck cancer cells with either IGF or EGF
resulted in IGF1R and EGFR heterodimerization, but only IGF
caused activating phosphorylation of both receptors, indicating
that the net effect of IGF-induced receptor signaling may rely, in
part, on EGFR activation and/or IGF1R/EGFR scaffolding interactions. They also found that combined treatment with a human
anti-IGF1R antibody A12 and the EGFR blocking antibody C225
was more effective at reducing cell proliferation and migration
than either agent alone (49). In light of these developments, our
findings provide an example that the TGFa autocrine loop can be
activated by PI3K via IGF1R signaling induction and that MAPK
can be activated subsequently by the activation of EGFR.
Furthermore, we showed that combination treatment of IGF1R
and EGFR kinase inhibitors resulted in synergy of growth inhibition
in three human colon cancer cell lines (Table 1; Fig. 5). This implies
that the heterogeneity of cross-talk between EGFR and IGF1R
displays distinct mechanisms even in the same cell line in terms of
regulating malignant cell growth. Intriguingly, the IC50 of Tarceva is
decreased 15-fold in combination with PQIP in FET cell line.
Similar dramatic changes were found in CBS and GEO cell lines as
well. The significant increase of Tarceva potency in combination
with an IGF1R inhibitor indicated that inhibition of IGF1R
activation sensitizes EGFR inhibition by Tarceva. Hence, targeting
one receptor such as IGF1R will lead to reshuffling of the
downstream signaling pathways, such as the PI3K pathway, and
affect the other receptor and EGFR signaling, simultaneously or
afterwards. Because the interactions of these signaling pathways
involve both cell cycle reentry and cell survival, the phenotype of
the tumor cells will eventually be changed and, in turn, alter drug
sensitivity.
