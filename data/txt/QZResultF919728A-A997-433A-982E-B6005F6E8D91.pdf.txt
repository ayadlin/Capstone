Abstract
Herein, for the first time, we evaluated the chemopreventive
efficacy of dietary silibinin against prostate cancer (PCa)
growth and progression in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the
mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice from two different genetic
backgrounds [C57BL/6 (TRAMP)  FVB; C57BL/6 (TRAMP) 
C57BL/6]. At 4 weeks of age, mice were fed control or 0.1% to
1% silibinin–supplemented diets until 23 to 24 weeks of age.
Silibinin-fed groups had a lower tumor grade and higher
incidence of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) at the
expense of a strong decrease in adenocarcinoma incidence.
Prostate tissue showed a 47% (P < 0.001) decrease in
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)–positive cells and
an f7-fold (P < 0.001) increase in apoptotic cells at the
highest silibinin dose. As potential mechanisms of silibinin
efficacy, an f50% (P < 0.05) decrease in insulin-like growth
factor (IGF) receptor type IB and an f13-fold (P < 0.001)
increase in IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) protein levels
were also observed. These changes were specific to tumors as
they were not reflected in circulating IGF-IGFBP-3 system.
Additionally, silibinin decreased protein expression of cyclindependent kinases (Cdk) by more than 90% (P < 0.001) with a
concomitant increase in Cdk inhibitors, Cip1/p21 and Kip1/
p27 (P < 0.05, for both). A dose-dependent decrease was also
observed in cyclin B1, cyclin E, and cyclin A protein levels by
silibinin. Together, these findings suggest that oral silibinin
blocks PCa growth and progression at PIN stage in TRAMP
mice via modulation of tumor IGF-IGFBP-3 axis and cell cycle
regulation, and therefore it has practical and translational
potential in suppressing growth and neoplastic conversion of
PIN to PCa in humans. [Cancer Res 2007;67(22):11083–91]

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common malignancy in
American men, and second only to lung cancer in deaths (1). With
time, PCa progresses to a hormone-refractory stage, rendering

antiandrogen therapy ineffective (2, 3). However, onset of
preclinical PCa may occur in men as early as 30 years of age and
takes considerable time for progression to detectable malignancy,
and, accordingly, a considerable window of time may allow for
various prevention strategies to be used (3). Recently, there have
been considerable activities directed toward identification of
dietary or nondietary naturally occurring chemical agents for both
prevention and intervention of PCa (4–6). One such agent is
silibinin, which has shown promising chemopreventive and
anticancer effects in various in vitro and in vivo studies (7).
Silibinin is a flavonolignan isolated from milk thistle (Silybum
marianum) seeds. Silibinin and its cruder form, silymarin, are well
known for their hepatoprotective activity and used clinically and as
dietary supplements against liver toxicity for decades (8). Both
silibinin and silymarin inhibit growth of many cancers of epithelial
origin, including PCa (3, 7, 9). Silibinin possesses strong anticancer
efficacy against both androgen-dependent and androgen-independent PCa, wherein it inhibits cell growth and induces cell cycle
arrest in human PCa LNCaP, PC-3, and DU145 cells (10–13).
Additionally, growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of silibinin
are observed in mouse tumorigenic TRAMP-C1 cells.8 Mechanistically, silibinin induces differentiation morphology; reduces
prostate specific antigen level; and induces cell cycle arrest
accompanied by an increase in cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)
inhibitors, inhibition of Cdk activity, decrease in phosphorylation of
retinoblastoma (Rb) and related proteins, and their increased
interaction with E2F family of transcription factors in cell culture
(3). Silibinin also inhibits in vivo growth of DU145 xenograft in
nude mice, which is mediated, in part, by an induction of insulinlike growth factor–binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3; ref. 14). However,
the chemopreventive efficacy of silibinin in a PCa model other than
xenograft and the in vivo effect of silibinin on Cdk-cyclin-Cdk
inhibitor axis and IGF type I receptor h (IGF-IRh) signaling and
their significance have not been studied in any existing animal
models of PCa.
Here, for the first time, we evaluated the chemopreventive
efficacy of dietary silibinin feeding against PCa growth and
progression and associated molecular alterations in transgenic
adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model, which was
developed in C57BL/6 mice using minimal rat probasin promoter
(PB) to drive the expression of SV40 early genes (T/t; Tag)

specifically in prostatic epithelium (15, 16). The transgene is
hormonally regulated, expressed at sexual maturity, and induces
spontaneous neoplastic epithelial transformation (17). SV40 large
T antigen abrogates p53 and Rb function; as a result, TRAMP male
mice develop spontaneous progressive stages of prostatic disease
with time from early lesions of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN) to late-stage metastatic adenocarcinoma and closely mimic
the progressive forms of human prostatic carcinoma (15, 18–20).
Therefore, our present findings of chemopreventive efficacy of
silibinin and associated mechanisms in TRAMP model could have
potential clinical significance.

Materials and Methods
Animals, treatment, and necropsy. TRAMP mice from two different
genetic backgrounds were studied to ensure that silibinin efficacy was strain
independent. Heterozygous TRAMP females, developed on a pure C57BL/6
background, were cross-bred with either nontransgenic C57BL/6 or FVB
breeder males. Tail DNA was subjected to PCR-based screening assay for
PB-Tag (17), and routinely obtained 4-week-old TRAMP male mice from
specific genetic backgrounds were randomly distributed into control and
treatment groups.
In the first experiment, C57BL/6 (TRAMP)  FVB (TRAMP/FVB) mice
were fed control AIN-93M (n = 17, positive control) or 0.5% (w/w) silibinin–
containing (n = 17) diet for 19 weeks. In the second experiment, C57BL/6
(TRAMP)  C57BL/6 (TRAMP/C57BL/6) mice were fed control and
silibinin [0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% silibinin (w/w) in AIN-93M purified] diets for
20 weeks; there were 17, 15, 18, and 16 mice in positive control, 0.1%, 0.5%,
and 1% silibinin–fed groups, respectively. As overall controls, nontransgenic mice (n = 5 mice per group) were fed control or highest silibinin dose
diet for same time. All diets were prepared commercially by Dyets. Silibinin
was from Sigma and its purity checked as >98% as described (21). During
the study, animals were permitted free access to drinking water and food.
Food consumption and animal body weight were recorded weekly, and
animals were monitored daily for their general health. Animal care and
treatments were in accordance with Institutional guidelines and approved
protocol.
At the time of sacrifice, the animals were anesthetized by ketamine
injection and then euthanized by exsanguination. Serum was separated
from the collected blood and stored at 80jC. Each mouse was weighed
and lower urogenital tract including bladder, seminal vesicles, and prostate
was removed en bloc. Lower urogenital tract wet weight was recorded and
prostate gland harvested and microdissected whenever possible (when a
tumor obscured the boundaries of the lobes it was taken as such). In
TRAMP/C57BL/6 group, one portion of dorsolateral prostate was snap
frozen and stored at 80jC. Tissues were fixed overnight in 10% (v/v)
phosphate-buffered formalin and processed conventionally. Sections (5 Am)
of paraffin-embedded tissues were stained with H&E for routine
histopathologic evaluation. At the time of necropsy, animals were also
examined for gross pathology, and any evidence of edema, abnormal organ
size, or appearance in nontarget organs was also noted.
Immunohistochemical analysis. Paraffin-embedded sections were
deparaffinized and stained with specific primary antibody followed by
3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DAB) staining, as previously described (22). Primary
antibodies used were anti-SV40 large T antigen (1:400; BD PharMingen),
anti-PCNA (1:250; DAKO), anti–IGF-IRh (1:50; Cell Signaling), and anti–
IGFBP-3 (1:25; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Biotinylated secondary antibodies used were rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:200; DAKO)
and goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Apoptotic cells
were identified by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP
nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using Dead End Colorometric TUNEL
System (Promega Corp.). PCNA- and TUNEL-positive cells were quantified
by counting brown-stained cells within total number of cells at 10 randomly
selected fields at 400 magnification. For IGF-IRh and IGFBP-3,
immunoreactivity (represented by intensity of brown staining) was scored

as 0 (no staining), +1 (nonuniform and very weak), +2 (nonuniform and
weak), +3 (uniform and moderate), and +4 (uniform and strong).
ELISA assays for mouse IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3. Mouse
recombinant IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 protein standards, monoclonal
antibodies, and biotinylated polyclonal antibodies were from R&D Systems.
Levels of murine IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 were measured using inhouse enzyme-linked immunoassays as published (23). IGF-I assay has a
sensitivity of 0.1 ng/mL. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of
variation were <10% in the range of 1 to 10 ng/mL. IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3
assays have a sensitivity of 0.2 ng/mL. The intra-assay and interassay
coefficients of variation were <6% and <8%, respectively, in the range of 1 to
6 ng/mL.
Immunoblot analysis. Dorsolateral prostate samples from positive
control and silibinin-fed groups of mice were analyzed by immunoblotting
as previously described (13). Primary antibodies were anti–IGFBP-3, antiCdk2, anti-Cdk4, anti-Cdk6, anti-Cdc2, anti–cyclin A, anti–cyclin B1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology); anti–cyclin E (Ab-1), anti-Kip1/p27 (NeoMarkers);
anti-Cip1/p21 (Upstate); and anti–IGF-IRh and anti–pIGF-IR-Tyr1131 (Cell
Signaling). Secondary antibodies were antirabbit IgG (Cell Signaling) or
antimouse IgG (Amersham). Equal protein loading was confirmed by
stripping and reprobing membranes with anti–h-actin primary antibody
(Sigma).
Statistical and microscopic analyses. All statistical analyses were
carried out with Sigma Stat software version 2.03 (Jandel Scientific), and
two-sided P < 0.05 was considered significant. m2 analysis and Fisher’s exact
test were used to compare incidence of PIN and adenocarcinoma in positive
control group versus silibinin-fed group. For other data, the difference
between positive control group versus silibinin-fed group was analyzed by
unpaired two-tailed Student’s t test and one-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni t test for pairwise multiple comparisons. Densitometric analysis
of immunoblots (adjusted with h-actin as loading control) was done with
Scion Image program (NIH). All microscopic histopathologic and immunohistochemical analyses were done with Zeiss Axioscope 2 microscope
(Carl Zeiss, Inc.) and photomicrographs were captured with Carl Zeiss
AxioCam MrC5 camera.

Results
Silibinin feeding reduces lower urogenital tract weight. In
TRAMP/FVB mice study, dietary silibinin feeding did not show any
considerable change in diet consumption and there was no
considerable difference in body weight between the positive
control and silibinin-fed mice during the entire treatment regimen
(data not shown). At the time of necropsy, all animals were
examined for gross pathology, and there was no evidence of edema,
abnormal organ size, or appearance in nontarget organs. However,
there was a significant difference in lower urogenital tract weight
between positive control (6.78 F 1.54 g) and silibinin-fed group
(1.75 F 0.54 g); the latter was 74% (P < 0.01) lower compared with
positive control. When lower urogenital tract weight was
normalized to body weight (Fig. 1A), silibinin-fed mice showed
66% (P < 0.05) lower urogenital tract weight compared with the
positive control. In subsequent experiment with TRAMP/C57BL/6
mice assessing dose-dependent effect of silibinin feeding (0.1–1%
silibinin, w/w), consistent with the first experiment, silibinin did
not show any observable change in diet consumption and body
weight of mice throughout the treatment (data not shown). At
necropsy, silibinin decreased lower urogenital tract weight
compared with the positive control group, although statistically
not significant (data not shown). Silibinin-treated groups did not
show any considerable decrease in the levels of SV40 T antigen in
different stages of prostate tumorigenesis compared with the
positive control group as observed by immunohistochemical
analysis of the transgene expression (Supplementary Fig. S1). In

nontransgenic mice, silibinin did not show any change in lower
urogenital tract weight (data not shown).
Silibinin feeding reduces adenocarcinoma incidence. H&Estained sections were microscopically examined and classified
based on Shappell et al. (24) with some modifications: (a) lowgrade PIN having foci with two or more layers of atypical cells with
elongated hyperchromatic nuclei and intact gland profiles; (b)
high-grade PIN having increased epithelial stratification, foci of
atypical cells fill or almost fill the lumen of the ducts, enlarged
diameter of glands, distorted duct profiles, increase in nuclear
pleomorphism, hyperchromatic nuclei, and cribriform structures;
(c) well-differentiated adenocarcinoma showing invasion of
basement membrane, loss of intraductal spaces, and increased
quantity of small glands; (d) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma showing total loss of intraductal spaces and relatively solid
growth; and (e) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma showing
sheets of poorly differentiated cells with remnants of trapped
glands.
In TRAMP/FVB mice study, histopathologic analysis of prostate
followed the same trend as gross pathology showing less
aggressiveness in silibinin-fed group. As shown in Fig. 1B, in
silibinin-fed group, on average, 45 F 8% area of prostate gland was
histologically normal compared with a 29 F 5% normal area in the
positive control. Further, the area covered by PIN lesions in
silibinin-fed group was 50% less than that in the positive control
group, although well-differentiated area in silibinin-fed group was
36 F 6% compared with 24 F 5% in the positive control. There was
a significant difference in the area covered by more aggressive
tumors between silibinin-fed and positive control groups; silibininfed group had 63% (P < 0.05) less poorly differentiated area
compared with the positive control. Furthermore, 15% of silibininfed mice had a 100% disease-free (normal) prostate whereas none
in the positive control group had an absolutely normal prostate
(Fig. 1C), and 12% of mice in the positive control group had 100%
of their prostate tissue replaced by adenocarcinoma, with half of
them displaying 100% poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.
In subsequent TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice study, detailed histopathologic analysis revealed that there was a marked difference in
tumor incidence between the positive control and silibinin-fed
groups. As shown in Fig. 2A, there was a difference in PIN incidence
between silibinin-fed and positive control groups. None of the mice
showed low-grade PIN in control and 0.1% silibinin–fed groups;
however, there was an emergence of low-grade PIN in 16% and 31%

Figure 2. Silibinin feeding inhibits neoplastic progression of prostate in
TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice. At the time of necropsy after 20 wk of silibinin feeding
(0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% silibinin in diet) starting from 4th week of age, each mouse
was weighed and the lower urogenital tract including the bladder, seminal
vesicles, and prostate was removed en bloc. n = 17 (positive control), n = 15
(0.1% silibinin fed), n = 18 (0.5% silibinin fed), and n = 16 (1% silibinin fed) mice
per group. The prostate glands were histopathologically analyzed for the different
stages of the neoplastic progression. A, effect of silibinin feeding on the

considered significant.

of mice in 0.5% and 1% silibinin–fed groups, respectively. Similarly,
high-grade PIN incidence was also noted to increase from 47% in
positive control to 66%, 66%, and 62% in 0.1%, 0.5% and 1%
silibinin–fed groups, respectively (Fig. 2A). However, there was a
concomitant dose-dependent decrease in adenocarcinoma incidence in silibinin-fed groups of mice compared with the positive
controls (Fig. 2B). There were 69% and 64% reductions in the
incidence of well-differentiated tumors in 0.5% and 1% silibinin–fed
group compared with the positive control mice, respectively. The
incidence of undifferentiated (both moderately and poorly
differentiated) tumors decreased from 35% in positive control to
33% and 11% in 0.1% and 0.5% silibinin–fed groups, respectively
(Fig. 2B). Strikingly, none of the mice showed moderately or poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma in 1% silibinin–fed group (Fig. 2B).
In nontransgenic mice, prostate histopathology did not show any
difference in control and silibinin-fed groups (data not shown).
These results suggest that silibinin feeding causes a dosedependent decrease in the incidence of adenocarcinoma and
blocks tumor progression at PIN stages.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (22). November 15, 2007

Silibinin feeding also reduces tumor grade. Because silibinin
dose-response study was conducted in TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice, we
decided to restrict further analysis only to the tissues obtained
from this study. As progressive pathologies of the disease are more
evident and aggressive in dorsolateral prostate, further studies were
conducted with a particular focus on dorsolateral prostate. To
assess severity of prostatic lesions, histologic data of TRAMP/
C57BL/6 mice were further analyzed for tumor grade. Tissues were
graded according to the criteria by Hurwitz et al. (25), where (a)
normal epithelium was assigned a score of 1.0; (b) low-grade PIN as
2.0; (c) high-grade PIN as 3.0; (d) well-differentiated adenocarcinoma as 4.0; (e) moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma as 5.0;
and ( f ) poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma as 6.0. To generate a
mean peak histologic score, the maximum histologic score for
individual prostate from each mouse was used to calculate a mean
for that treatment group. As shown in Fig. 3A, there was a
significant reduction in the severity of lesions in 0.5% and 1%
silibinin–fed groups. Specifically, TRAMP mice fed with 1% silibinin
had a significantly lower tumor grade (mean peak score, 2.7; P <
0.001) than the positive control group (mean peak score, 4.0). The
0.5% silibinin–fed group also had a significantly lower tumor grade
(mean peak score, 3.2; P < 0.05) than the positive control, whereas
the 0.1% silibinin–fed group had only a slightly lower tumor grade
(mean peak score, 3.9). The photomicrographs, representative of
mean peak histologic score of a treatment group, are shown in
Fig. 3B. These results convincingly suggest that, in addition to
reducing adenocarcinoma incidence, silibinin feeding decreases the
severity of prostatic lesions in a dose-dependent manner.
Silibinin feeding reduces proliferation index but increases
apoptosis. To assess the in vivo effect of silibinin feeding on
proliferation index in the dorsolateral prostate, tissue samples from
TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice were analyzed by PCNA immunostaining.
Qualitative microscopic examination of PCNA-stained sections
showed a substantial decrease in PCNA-positive cells in silibininfed groups compared with the positive control (Fig. 4A ).
Quantification of PCNA staining showed 47 F 5%, 36 F 7%, and
31 F 4% PCNA-positive cells in 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% silibinin–fed
groups of mice compared with 58 F 2% in the positive control
(Fig. 4A), accounting for a decrease in proliferation indices by 19%,
38% (P < 0.01), and 47% (P < 0.001), respectively. These results
suggest an in vivo antiproliferative effect of silibinin during tumor
growth and progression in dorsolateral prostate of TRAMP mice.
Regarding in vivo apoptotic response of silibinin feeding on
prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice, microscopic
examination of tissue sections showed an increased number of
TUNEL-positive cells in silibinin-fed groups (Fig. 4B). The numbers
of TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells were 13 F 0.7%, 18 F 1%, and
26 F 4% in 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% silibinin–fed groups of mice,
respectively, compared with 4 F 0.3% in the positive controls,
accounting for an f7-fold (P < 0.001) increase in apoptotic cells by
highest silibinin dose. This finding suggests that proapoptotic
effect could be another potential mechanism underlying chemopreventive effect of silibinin on prostate tumorigenesis in TRAMP
model.
Silibinin impairs IGF-I signaling pathway. Recently, we
showed that silibinin has an antiproliferative effect against PC-3
cells in vitro and induces IGFBP-3 secretion to inhibit IGF-I
signaling (13), and that it inhibits in vivo growth of DU145
xenograft with a concomitant increase in tumor IGFBP-3 and its
secretion in mouse plasma (14, 22). These findings prompted us to
assess whether dietary silibinin had an effect on IGF-IR signaling

of epithelium). Immunoreactivity scores for IGF-IRh were 1.7 F 0.3,
1.5 F 0.3 (P < 0.05), and 1.5 F 0.3 (P < 0.05) for 0.1%, 0.5% and 1%
silibinin–fed groups of mice, respectively, compared with 2.9 F 0.4
in the positive controls (Fig. 5A). These results were further
confirmed by immunoblot analysis showing lower levels of IGF-IRh
protein in silibinin-fed groups (Fig. 5A). Densitometric analysis of
bands (adjusted with h-actin as loading control) exhibited 58% to
63% (P < 0.05) decrease in IGF-IRh protein expression in silibininfed groups of mice. Concomitant with decreased IGF-IRh,
dorsolateral prostate tissues from silibinin-fed groups of mice also
showed reduced phosphorylation of IGF-IRh at Tyr1131 in kinase
domain compared with the positive controls (data not shown).
Regarding IGFBP-3, there was an increase in its cytoplasmic
staining in silibinin-fed groups of mice compared with the positive
controls (Fig. 5B). Immunoreactivity scores were 2.8 F 0.3, 3.0 F
0.2, and 3.6 F 0.2 in 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% silibinin–fed groups (P <
0.001, for all doses), respectively, compared with 1.2 F 0.2 in the
positive controls. Again, these findings were confirmed by
immunoblot analysis of prostate tissue lysates, which showed
higher IGFBP-3 levels in silibinin-fed groups (Fig. 5B). Densitometric analysis of bands (adjusted with h-actin as loading control)

Randomly, prostate tissue samples of four individual mice were selected from each group for IGF-IRh and IGFBP-3 immunoblotting. Reactive protein bands were
visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system, and membrane was stripped and reprobed with h-actin as loading control. Columns, mean densitometric

showed f7-fold (P < 0.01) and f13-fold (P < 0.001) increase in
IGFBP-3 levels in 0.5% and 1% silibinin–fed groups of mice,
respectively, compared with the positive controls. In the first
TRAMP/FVB experiment, serum levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-2, and
IGFBP-3 were examined. Silibinin had no statistically significant
effects on circulating levels of these hormones when compared
with the positive control (data not shown). Together, these
observations, for the first time, suggested that silibinin could
inhibit the mitogenic action of IGF-I mostly via decreasing IGF-IRh
expression level and by an intratumoral up-regulation of IGFBP-3,
which may also have IGF-I–independent activity during prostate
tumor growth and progression in TRAMP model.
Silibinin modulates cell cycle regulators. We also determined
the effect of silibinin feeding on the expression of cell cycle
regulators in the prostate of TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice. Western blots
for Cdks, cyclins, and Cdk inhibitors with densitometric data
(adjusted with h-actin as loading control) are shown in Fig. 6. Here,
it should be noted that membranes were stripped and reprobed for
h-actin for each blot (data not shown). Silibinin strongly decreased

protein levels of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdc2 by 73% to 97%
(P < 0.001), 87% to 96% (P < 0.001), 91% to 97% (P < 0.001), and
>99% (P < 0.001), respectively, in 0.1% to 1% silibinin–fed groups of
mice compared with the positive controls (Fig. 6). Regarding
protein levels of cyclins, 0.1%, 0.5%, and 1% silibinin showed a
strikingly f100% (P < 0.001, for all doses of silibinin) decrease in
cyclin A; 22%, 39% (P < 0.05), and 75% (P < 0.01) decrease in cyclin
B1; and 50%, 80% (P < 0.05), and 88% (P < 0.01) decrease in cyclin E,
respectively (Fig. 6), without any effect on cyclin D1 and cyclin D3
(data not shown). Regarding Cdk inhibitors, there was a marked
increase in the Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27 protein levels in silibininfed groups (Fig. 6), which was significant with 0.5% and 1% doses,
where f4-fold (P < 0.05) and f7-fold (P < 0.05) increases in Cip1/
p21 and Kip1/p27 levels were observed for the two silibinin-fed
groups of mice, respectively. Together, these results indicate that
silibinin strongly decreases Cdks and cyclin expression with a
concomitant increase in Cdk inhibitors to potentially inhibit cell
cycle progression at G1-S and G2-M checkpoints, which could
inhibit prostate tumor progression in TRAMP mice.

Silibinin Inhibits PCa Progression in TRAMP Mice

Discussion
The novel findings in the present study are that (a) oral silibinin, a
common dietary supplement as well as a clinically used antihepatotoxic agent, inhibits prostate tumor growth and progression in
TRAMP mice without any toxicity, and (b) the chemopreventive
efficacy of silibinin is accompanied by the arrest of tumor progression at PIN stages with a concomitant decrease in adenocarcinoma,
together with a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in
apoptotic cell death. Potential molecular mechanisms of silibinin
efficacy, as identified in TRAMP model, are decreased expression of
IGF-IRh with a concomitant increase in cellular IGFBP-3 protein level
and decreased expression of Cdks and cyclins with a concomitant
increase in Cdk inhibitor (Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27) protein levels.

In humans, progression of PCa is a multistage process involving
the onset as a small carcinoma of low histologic grade progressing
slowly to the metastatic lesions of higher grade. PCa development
in TRAMP model closely mimics this human type of PCa
progression in a stochastic fashion (20, 26). Chemopreventive
strategies involving naturally occurring agents for PCa intervention
are gaining increased attention because epidemiologic evidence
suggests that dietary habits and lifestyle are among the major
factors in PCa growth and progression (4–6, 27). In the last few
decades, considerable progress has been made in this direction
leading to identification of many cancer chemopreventive agents,
one of them being silibinin, which has shown anticancer effects in
various cancer cell types and animal tumor models (3, 9, 27–29).

Figure 6. Silibinin feeding alters the expression levels of cell cycle regulatory molecules in the dorsolateral prostate of TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice. Randomly, four prostate
tissue samples from individual mice were selected from each group for immunoblot analyses as detailed in Materials and Methods. Reactive protein bands for the
expression of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, Cdc2, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin E, Cip1/p21, and Kip1/p27 were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection system,
and membranes were stripped and probed with h-actin as loading control. Columns, mean densitometric values of band intensity for each protein, adjusted with

Cancer Research

In the present study, silibinin feeding reduced prostate
adenocarcinoma incidence by slowing down tumor progression
from PIN stages (premalignant) to adenocarcinoma (malignant),
and this effect was independent of mouse strains as evidenced by
similar trends in two different mouse strains (TRAMP/FVB and
TRAMP/C57BL/6) used in the study. TRAMP mice from two
different genetic backgrounds were studied because it has been
reported that mice generated with C57BL/6 and FVB backgrounds
show strain-specific responses to the transgene mediated transformation of the prostatic epithelium, and that the nature of
progression is different in these two strains (16, 20). The TRAMP/
C57BL/6 mice show a slower time to progression and live longer
(f52 weeks), and they also display seminal vesicle invasion that
can contribute disproportionately to the lower urogenital tract
weight (20). The TRAMP/FVB mice show quick progression,
develop large primary tumors, and rarely live beyond 32 weeks of
age (20). By 30 weeks of age, TRAMP/FVB mice display 100%
metastasis to lungs and lymph nodes along with bone metastasis,
whereas TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice do not display 100% metastasis at
this stage (20). In our present study, the anti–tumor progression
effect of silibinin was observed to be dose dependent; additionally,
in a similar fashion, it also reduced the severe form of adenocarcinoma (i.e., poorly/undifferentiated adenocarcinoma), which
leads to a metastatic phenotype of the disease. The anti-PCa effect
of silibinin was accompanied by a decrease in lower urogenital
tract weight as well as antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects as
observed by immunohistochemical analysis of prostate samples.
Silibinin feeding did not negatively regulate the expression of
transgene in prostate epithelial cells, which initiates the process of
tumorigenesis. Further, silibinin feeding for 20 weeks starting from
the 4th week of age neither showed any toxic effects in mice nor
influenced normal histology of the prostate in nontransgenic mice,
suggesting that silibinin could be an ideal chemopreventive agent
to suppress prostate tumor growth and progression.
IGF-I signaling is reported to be deregulated in clinical PCa
(30–33). Specifically, IGFBP-2 levels are often increased whereas
those of IGFBP-3 are decreased, resulting in increased IGF-I levels
(34–36). Furthermore, IGF-IR has been reported to be overexpressed
in prostate tumor specimens (37). Silibinin feeding to TRAMP mice
significantly reduced IGF-IR expression, as well as its activating
tyrosine phosphorylation, and up-regulated IGFBP-3 protein levels.
Because of high binding affinity of IGFBP-3 for IGF-I, these findings
suggest that silibinin would have led to a lower amount of free IGF-I
for its mitogenic action. We did not observe substantial changes in
circulating IGF system in mouse serum from our first experiment
(data not shown). The increase in tumor IGFBP-3 can prevent both
systemic and local IGF effects on proliferation and survival. In
addition, a strong increase in cellular IGFBP-3 may also exert
antineoplastic effect through IGF-I–independent mechanisms, such
as induction of apoptosis (38–40) as observed in the present study.
This shows that silibinin acts specifically on tumor to increase
IGFBP-3 and that it has insignificant effect on modulating the
systemic IGF axis. This is a very ‘‘clean’’ effect without any

disturbance in systemic IGF axis by silibinin treatment, which is
different from some other agents such as somatostatin and lycopene
that do affect systemic IGF axis (41, 42). Overall, pleiotropic
molecular alterations were observed, suggesting down-regulation
of IGF-I-IGF-IR–mediated signaling and an increase in cellular
IGFBP-3 level by silibinin during inhibition of prostate tumor growth
and progression. Because these modulations are implicated in both
mitogenic and survival effects, as expected, silibinin also caused a
marked decrease in cell proliferation and strongly enhanced apoptosis. Such in vivo effects of silibinin on these two biomarkers are
also supported by our completed DU145 tumor xenograft study (14).
Further, based on our earlier in vitro studies in PCa cells (9), it
was anticipated that the antiproliferative effect of silibinin against
prostate tumor progression might also involve cell cycle regulatory
mechanisms. The changing patterns of Cdks and cyclins have been
well characterized during the progression of PCa in TRAMP model,
wherein an up-regulation of mitotic cyclins, including cyclin A,
cyclin B, and cyclin E, and a decrease in cyclin D1 have been
observed (43). The levels of cyclin D3 showing increased expression
compared with normal prostate do not greatly vary during the
disease progression (43). In our present study, silibinin downregulated the expression of Cdk2, Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdc2, as well as
cyclin E, cyclin A, and cyclin B1, in the prostate of TRAMP mice.
Additionally, silibinin also increased the protein expression of Cdk
inhibitors, Cip1/p21 and Kip1/p27, which are well known to
interact with and inhibit kinase activity of Cdk-cyclin complex (3).
Therefore, the anti–tumor progression effect of silibinin in TRAMP
mice could most likely be mediated, at least in part, via its effect on
Cdk-cyclin-Cdk inhibitor axis.
In summary, silibinin feeding inhibits prostate tumor growth as
well as progression in TRAMP mice without any adverse health
effects. Potential mechanisms for this anti-PCa effect of silibinin
are most likely the down-modulation of IGF-I signaling and
decrease in Cdk-cyclin kinase activity leading to an inhibition of
cell cycle progression accompanied by decreased cell proliferation
and enhanced apoptosis. These findings, together with those in
nude mice DU145 xenograft, suggest that silibinin could be a useful
agent for PCa prevention and intervention. Finally, we would like to
mention that based on our extensive preclinical studies with
silibinin in PCa models, we have successfully completed a National
Cancer Institute–funded phase I clinical trial in human PCa
patients (44) and are currently conducting a pilot phase II clinical
trial. In this regard, present findings on the anti–tumor progression
effect of silibinin with potential molecular mechanisms would have
paramount significance.
