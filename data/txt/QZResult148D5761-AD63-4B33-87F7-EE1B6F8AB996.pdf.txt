Summary
In multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable B-cell neoplasm, mutation or deletion of p53 is rarely
detected at diagnosis. Using small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2, we provide evidence that
miR-192, 194 and 215, which are down-regulated in a subset of newly diagnosed MMs, can be
transcriptionally activated by p53 and then modulate MDM2 expression. Furthermore, ectopic reexpression of these miRNAs in MM cells increases the therapeutic action of MDM2 inhibitors in
vitro and in vivo by enhancing their p53-activating effects. In addition, miR-192 and 215 target
the IGF pathway, preventing enhanced migration of plasma cells into bone marrow. The results
suggest that these miRNAs are positive regulators of p53 and that their down-regulation plays a
key role in MM development.

Significance
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Therapeutic activation of p53 may be particularly appropriate for treatment of the ∼50% of
hematopoietic malignancies with intact TP53. We describe a signaling pathway in which
miR-192, 194 and 215 are regulators of the MDM2/p53 auto regulatory loop, controlling the
balance between p53 and MDM2 expression. Hypermethylation of the miR-194-2-192
cluster promoter in MM cell lines suggests that epigenetic down-regulation of these
miRNAs, which leads to increased MDM2 mRNA and protein expression, decreases the
ability of p53 to down-modulate MDM2 expression, thus tipping the regulatory loop in
favor of MDM2. Exploring these miRNAs as enhancers in the pharmacological activation of
the p53 pathway in MM cells might open avenues for miRNA-targeted therapies and MM
treatment.

Introduction

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated by mutations or deletions in cancer. p53
acts as a potent transcription factor and can be activated in response to diverse stresses,
leading to induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis or senescence (Junttila et al., 2009; Xue et
al., 2007). Although regulation of the p53 pathway is not fully understood at the molecular
level, it has been well established that activated p53 suppresses cancer progression,
underlining why cancer cells have developed multiple mechanisms to disable p53 function
(Danovi et al., 2004; Ventura et al., 2007). In human tumors that retain wild-type (WT) p53
(Junttila et al., 2009; Lane, 2001) p53 can be antagonized by murine double minute 2
(MDM2), a negative regulator of p53 that is also overpriced in many human tumors,
offering a therapeutic strategy (Dickens et al., 2009; Brown et al., 2009). It has been
reported that inhibiting MDM2 expression can re-activate p53 in cancer cells, leading to
their demise (Dickens et al., 2009; Saha et al., 2010).

TP53 mutation is rarely detected at diagnosis in many hematological cancers such as
multiple myeloma (MM), acute myeloid leukemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and
Hodgkin's disease (HD). Thus, numerous reports have shown that therapeutic induction of
p53 might be particularly suitable for the treatment of hematological malignancies (Saha et
al., 2010). Among them, multiple myeloma (MM) is a currently incurable plasma cell
proliferative disorder that results in considerable morbidity and mortality (Kuehl et al.,
2002; Fonseca et al., 2009). MM develops from a benign condition called monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) (Weiss et al., 2009). Individuals with
MGUS often remain stable for years and do not require treatment. However, for unknown
reasons, this benign condition can evolve into MM at a rate of ∼1% per year, with some
MMs developing after many years (Kuehl et al., 2002; Fonseca et al., 2009).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In MGUS and in the majority of newly diagnosed MM cases TP53 is WT (Kuehl et al.,
2002; Chng et al., 2007) and the protein is rarely detectable (Stuhmer et al. 2006).
Interestingly, in MM cells, expression of p53 protein levels can be rescued by antagonizing
MDM2. Several reports have focused on the p53-mediated apoptotic pathway, upon
endogenous p53 protein re-expression by the small-molecule MDM2 antagonists (Nutlins)
and target genes wich may be involved in p53-dependent apoptosis in MM cells have been
identified (Stuhmer et al. 2006).
MicroRNAs are an abundant class of short, non protein-coding RNAs that mediate the
regulation of target genes posttranscriptionally and that have emerged as master regulators
in diverse physiologic and pathologic processes (Bartel, 2004), and oncogenesis (Croce,
2008). Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be directly transactivated by
p53 (He et al, 2007). miRNAs have also been shown to target p53 and/or components of p53
regulatory pathways, thereby directly and/or indirectly affecting its activities (Park et al.,
Cancer Cell. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 01.

2009; Zhang et al., 2009). We previously published the global miRNA–expression profiles
of MM and MGUS, and contrasted these profiles with those of normal plasma cells (PCs)
(Pichiorri et al., 2008). The findings defined a miRNA signature related to expression and
regulation of proteins associated with malignant transformation of PCs, such as p53
(Pichiorri et al., 2008). We have now examined the regulation and functional roles of
miRNAs in MM development using small-molecule inhibitors of MDM2.

Results
Identification of p53-regulated miRNAs in MM

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if miRNAs are regulated by p53 in MM cells, we performed custom
microarray analysis with an expanded set of probes capable of assaying the expression of
more than 500 human miRNAs. Two approaches to compare the effect of p53 level on
miRNA expression were used. We first assessed a specific signature associated with the
presence of WT TP53 in MM cell lines as shown in Figure 1A and Table S1. Six MM cell
lines were used in the analyses: MM1s, NCI-H929 and KMS28BM which retain and express
WT TP53; RPMI-8226, U266 with mutant TP53; and JJN3 that do not express TP53
mRNA. Western blot analysis of these cells shows their p53 and MDM2 steadystate protein
levels respectively (Figure S1A). Genomic and cDNA sequence analyses confirmed the
presence of WT TP53 cells in association with higher MDM2 mRNA expression (Figure
S1B). Several differentially expressed-miRNAs were identified (Table S1). Some of these
miRNAs, such as those of miR-34 family, have been found to be associated with p53 status
in other human malignancies (Hermeking et al., 2010). In the second approach, we
performed miRNA microarray analysis in MM1s cells treated with or without Nutlin-3a (10
μM), a small-molecule inhibitor of MDM2 (Figure 1B). In response to Nutlin-3a treatment,
we identified expression of distinct miRNAs associated with p53 activation (Figure 1B.
Table S2). Only two miRNAs were up-regulated in both analyses: miR-34a and miR-194
(Figure 1A, B; Table S1, S2). These results not only confirm up-regulation of miR-34a as a
function of wild-type (WT) p53 status (He et al., 2007) but also point to strong up-regulation
of miR-194 by p53 (Table S1, S2; Figure 1A,B). The significant up-regulation of miR-192
and miR-215 after p53 re-expression through Nutlin-3a treatment is especially interesting
because they are located, together with miR-194, in two related microRNA clusters, the
miR-194-2-192 cluster at 11q13.1 and the miR-215-194-1 cluster at 1q41.1 (Table S2), and
have the same seed sequence. Genomic locations of these two clusters have been reported to
be important for MM (Fonseca et al., 2009). miR-194 also has the same mature sequence
regardless its expression cluster and miRNAs of the same cluster are usually expressed
together (Garofalo et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2008).

p53 induces the expression of miR-192, 194 and 215
To confirm the microarray data, we first tested by q-RT-PCR for the presence of miR-34a,
miR-194 and its cluster associate, miR-192 and 215, in WT TP53 compared to Mut TP53
cells (Figure S1C). WT TP53 cells retained higher expression of miR-34a, miR-194 and
miR-192 (Figure S1C), but did not show expression of miR-215, suggesting that the 11q13.1
miR-194-2-192 cluster is associated with WT TP53 status in MM cells. To determine the
kinetics of p53 activation, we treated MM 1s cells with 10 μM Nutlin-3a for different
duration of time. p53 was barely detectable by immunoblotting at 6hr but increased after 12,
18 and 24 hrs of treatment and remain constant at 30-36 hrs (Figure 1C). The induction of
p53 was also associated with MDM2 accumulation, p21 expression and c-MYC down
regulation after 12 hrs of treatment (Figure 1C). The expression of p21-encoding CDKN1A,
a p53 target gene, was also assessed by RT-PCR (Figure 1D). By northern blot and qRTPCR analysis, we also studied the kinetics of miRNA activation during p53 up-modulation
in MM 1s cells. The kinetics of miR-34a, miR-194, miR-192 and miR-215 expression

(Figure 1E) were directly correlated with p53 protein up-regulation and p21 activation
(Figure 1C,D), while for miR-15 and miR-29a/b the dynamics of expression appeared more
related to down-regulation of their repressor c-MYC as expected (Chang et al., 2008)
(Figure S1D,S1E, Figure 1D), than to p53 activation. To confirm the responsiveness of these
miRNAs to p53, cell lines with varying TP53 status were treated with Nutlin-3a or vehicle
(DMSO), followed by qRT-PCR to monitor miRNA levels upon p53 activation (Figure S1FS1K). Induction of miR-34a, miR-192, miR-215 and miR-194 was detected only in the cell
lines treated with Nutlin-3a and harboring WT TP53 (p<0.001, Figure S1). Next, we
analyzed induction of these miRNAs, by Nutlin-3a in freshly isolated CD-138+ PCs (Figure
S1L), from 8 bone marrow aspirates of MM patients. Two samples (Pt-1 and Pt-2) exhibited
TP53 deletion by FISH analysis, while 6 (Pt-3 to Pt-8) retained TP53 genes (Table S3). We
detected induction of p53, miR-34a, 192, 194, 215 after 12 hrs of Nutlin-3a treatment
(Figure S1M-S1O) in TP53 WT samples, in association with different levels of CDKN1A
mRNA activation (Figure S1O). Furthermore, to determine if these miRNAs are relevant in
MM pathogenesis, we analyzed the expression of miR-194, 192 and 215 in a panel of
CD138+ PCs obtained from newly diagnosed MM patients (n=33), MGUS (n=14) patients
and normal donors (n=4) (Table S3) by qRT-PCR (Figure 1F-1H). Through Kruskal-Wallis
analysis we found that these clusters of miRNAs are consistently down-regulated in MM
samples (p<0.001) compared to MGUS samples.

Identification of the p53 core element in the pri-miR-192-194-2 promoter at 11q13.1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if p53 is directly involved in the transcriptional regulation of miR-194-2-192
and miR-215-194-1 clusters, we analyzed the cluster promoter regions. The upstream
genomic region close to the transcription start site (TSS) (+1) (Hino et al., 2008) of primiR-194-2-192 contains several highly conserved regions among human, mouse, rat, and
dog sequences (from −162 to +21 with respect to the TSS). To identify the promoter region
responsive to p53 re-expression, we constructed reporter plasmids carrying various genomic
sequences around the TSS of the pri-miR-194-2-192 cluster and subjected them to luciferase
assay (Figure 2A). Bioinformatics search identified a previously reported high score p53
consensus site between -900/-912 bp (Sinha et al., 2008; Song et al., 2008), however this site
was not functional for p53 activation since luciferase reporter constructs excluding this
region retained full activity (P3-P7) (Figure 2A). The region from -245 to +186 bp (P7) had
promoter activity comparable to that of the longest regions in MM cells after forced
expression of p53 (Figure 2A), but regions from -125 to +186 bp (P8) and -912 to -245 bp
(P10) did not. We identified a p53-responsive element between -245 and -125 bp (Figure
2B) because the construct excluding this region was not affected by p53 expression (Figure
2A). Since conserved regions in a given gene promoter are expected to contain regulatory
elements, we focused on the highly conserved region controlling luciferase activity, the
region between -161 and -135 bp. Luciferase assay using a construct mutated for each C and
G contained in the two decamers of the hypothetical El-Deiry consensus sequence revealed
that this non predicted and previously unpublished region is critical for p53 transcriptional
activation of the pri-miR-194-2-192 cluster (Figure 2B). Indeed, we found that endogenous
p53 directly interacts with the core element of the pri-miR-194-2 promoter in MM1s cells,
as demonstrated by CHIP assay after 12 hr of Nutlin-3a treatment (Figure 2C). As a positive
control, we used the p53 consensus site on the miR-34a promoter , while a nonspecific
sequence served as negative control (Figure 2C). Ectopic-expression of p53 activated the
promoter of both members of the pri-miR-194-2-192 cluster in MM1s cells (Figure 2D).
MDM2 siRNA after p53 re-expression in MM1s cells led to higher relative luciferase
activity and thus confirmed its dependence on p53 re-activation. Taken together, these data
suggest that p53 is a key transcriptional activator of pri-miR-194-2 through directly binding
to the core promoter element (Figure 2D). We also attempted to identify the promoter and
primary transcript of miR-215-194-1 on chromosome 1q41.1, but could not identify the

primary transcript initiation point by 3′ and 5′ RACE and PCR amplification of the putative
transcribed sequences (EST), however we confirmed the previously published consensus site
for p53 by CHIP analysis (Figure S2).
miR-192, 194 and 215 affect p53-dependent MM cell growth

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To examine the relevance of p53-mediated regulation of miR-192, 194 and 215 in MM, we
first tested whether reintroduction of these miRNAs affected the biology of MM cells.
Previous studies (Georges et al., 2008; Braun et al., 2008) showed that such reintroduction
induced expression of p21 in different cancer cell lines which carried WT TP53, with a
consistent G0/G1 arrest and p53 protein expression. The molecular mechanism of p53 reexpression remained elusive. To confirm this effect in our model, miR-192, miR-194 and
miR-215 were introduced into transfection in WT TP53 cell lines (MM1s, NCI-H929 and
KMS28BM), as well as cells with mutated TP53 (RPMI-8226), followed by detection of
TP53 and mRNAs of target genes CDKN1A and MDM2, by RT-PCR analysis (Figure S3).
We found consistent re-expression of CDKN1A in TP53 WT cells (Figure S3A) after
transfection, but did not detect any increase in TP53 mRNA (Figure S3B). Using MTS
assay, we observed significant growth arrest in the cells transfected with miR-192, 215 and a
less significant arrest with miR-194 in MM cells carrying WT TP53 (Figure 3A-3C), as
compared to scrambled sequences. By contrast, we did not detect this effect in RPMI-8226
cells (Figure 3D) expressing mutant TP53. Next, we determined if p53-responsive miRNAs
interfere with the clonogenic survival of MM cells. MM cells were lentivirustransduced with
miR-192, miR-215, miR-194 and miR-34a, miR-192 and 215 in WT p53 cells suppressed
colony formation to an extent comparable to miR-34a, which was used as an internal
control. Of note, miR-194 was less effective than miR-215 and miR-192. These miRNAs
did not suppress colony formation in RPMI-8226 (Figure 3E and 3F) or U266 cells
(unpublished data), while miR-34a did exhibit colony suppression in these mutant TP53
cells, confirming its p53 independent apoptotic action (Hermeking et al., 2010).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further explore the p53-dependent mechanism(s) of miR-192, 215 and 194 interferences
with cell growth and colony formation, we used flow cytometry to determine if their
expression affects progression through the cell cycle. We noted that in the two WT TP53
cell lines with high expression of MDM2 mRNA, MM1s and NCI-H929 (Figure S1B), the
p53-responsive miRNAs induced a consistent G0/G1 arrest. This effect was observed in
∼30% of scrambled-transfected cells vs ∼60% of the cells transfected with miR-192 and 215
and ∼45% for miR-194 (Figure 3G,H). By contrast in KMS-28BM cells, retaining WT TP53
but expressing lower levels of MDM2 mRNA (Figure S1B), we detected increases of subG1fractions (indicative of cell death) in cells transfected with miR-192(∼25% sub-G1), 215
(30%) and 194 (12%) at 48 hrs after transfection, compared to ∼3% in control cells
transfected with the Scr sequence (Figure 3I). At 48 hrs after transfection we also detected
increased caspase-3 activity (Figure 3J). The differential effect of the miRNAs on TP53 WT
cells carrying lower MDM2 mRNA basal expression (Figure S1B) led us to analyze MDM2
levels after miRNA transfection (Figure S3C). MDM2 mRNA, but not protein, was detected
after MM cells transfection. Because MDM2 protein is rapidly auto-ubiquitinated and
degraded through the proteasome pathway (Marine et al., 2010); p53 induction is necessary
for its detection in MM cells (Stuhmer et al., 2006; Ooi et al., 2009). Only in one (Mut TP53
RPMI-8226) of six MM cell lines analyzed, was MDM2 protein detected without p53
activation (Figure S1A, S1G). We also noted that MDM2 mRNA was down-regulated after
ectopic expression of these miRNAs, mostly in WT TP53 cells, but to some extent also in
Mut TP53 cells (RPMI-8226) (Figure S3C). These data were confirmed at the protein level
in RPMI-8226 cells where we observed ∼20% down regulation of MDM2 protein at 72 hr
after miRNA transfection (Figure S3D). The results indicate that ectopic expression of

Human MDM2 is a direct target of miR-192, 194 and 215

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The data thus far demonstrate that the biological functions of miR-192, 215 and 194 in MM
cells is p53-dependent. After introduction of these miRNAs the TP53 mRNA level did not
change in MM cells but higher CDKN1A and lower MDM2 mRNA levels were observed
(Figure S3). Both genes, MDM2 and CDKN1A, are direct targets of p53 but their expression
in this case was not preceded by TP53 transcription (Figure S3B). Thus, we hypothesized
that miR-192, 194 and 215 could target the expression of MDM2. To further examine the
effects of these miRNAs on MDM2 protein expression in WT TP53 MM cells, we analyzed
the consequences of ectopic expression of miR-192, miR-194 and miR-215 at 72 hrs after
transfection and 12 hrs of non genotoxic activation of p53 by Nutlin-3a (10 μM). Increased
expression of these miRs upon transfection was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure S4A), and
the effects on p53, MDM2 and p21 levels were analyzed by Western blot (Figure 4A). Overexpression of miR-192, 194 and miR-215 significantly increased the level of p53 and p21 at
12 hrs after Nutlin-3a treatment compared to Scr-transfected cells (p<0.001), as shown by
densitometric analysis in Figure 4B,C. Expression of MDM2 protein was dramatically
decreased in both cell lines (Figure 4A-C). Conversely, knockdown by 2′-O-me-antimiR-192-194 and 215 (pool) after 12 hr of Nutlin-3a treatment, as confirmed by qRT-PCR
(Figure S4B) in TP53 WT cell lines, increased the level of MDM2 protein (p<0.01), while
p21 and p53 protein levels were attenuated (p<0.01) (Figure 4B), as confirmed by
densitometry (Figure 4E). We also confirmed that MDM2 mRNA levels were strongly
reduced in the miR-192, 194 and 215 transfected cells at 6 and 12 hr of Nutlin-3a treatment
in both cell lines (Figures 4C). These results indicate that miR-192, 194 and 215 induce the
degradation of MDM2 mRNA, confirming that they regulate both, protein and RNA levels.
We next tested whether MDM2 is a direct target of these miRNAs by performing a
bioinformatics search (Target Scan [Lewis et al., 2003], Pictar [Krek et al., 2005]), but were
unable to identify the 3′-UTR of MDM2 as a target. Because the 3′-UTR of MDM2 is not
well conserved across species, we decided to use the RNA22 target prediction program
(Miranda et al., 2006) which does not need validated targets for training, and neither
requires nor relies on cross-species conservation. RNA22 predicted two miRNA responsive
elements (MREs) for miR-192/215 and two MREs for miR-194 in the 3′UTR of human
MDM2 (HDM2) (Figures 4D and S4C-S4G). To verify that HDM2 is a direct target of
miR-192, miR-194 and miR-215, HDM2 3′UTR containing all MREs (∼4K), was cloned
into pGL3 basic construct downstream of the luciferase open reading frame (Figure 4D).
This reporter construct was used to transfect MM1s cells which express the endogenous
miRs following up-modulated p53 expression. Increased expression of these miRs upon
transfection significantly diminished luciferase expression (Figure 4D). We subsequently
screened the predicted MREs on the 3′UTR of HDM2 mRNA, using luciferase assays with
4 different constructs carrying the MREs for miR-192/215 and miR-194 (Figure S4H-S4K).
We observed that expression of each specific MRE reporter construct was specifically down
regulated upon transfection of each individual miRNA. Conversely, when we performed
luciferase assays using a plasmid harboring the binding sites inactivated by site-directed
mutagenesis, we observed a consistent reduction in the inhibitory effects (Figure S4H-S4K).
We also analyzed the expression of MDM2 mRNA in a panel of CD138+ PCs obtained from
MM patients, MGUS patients and normal donors by RT-PCR (Figure 4E). Through
Kruskal-Wallis analysis we found that MDM2 mRNA is significantly up-regulated in MM
samples (p<0.001) compared to MGUS samples and normal PCs (Figure 4E). Using non
parametric test analysis, we found a significant inverse correlation between miR-192
expression and MDM2 mRNA in MM samples (Sperman ρ= -0.698, p<0001, n=33) (Figure
4F).

miR-192, 194 and 215 re-expression enhances sensitivity of WT TP53 MM cells to non
genotoxic activation of p53 in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To determine if re-expression of the miRNAs could enhance sensitivity of WT TP53 MM
cells to non genotoxic activation of p53, we tested MI-219, a highly selective, orally active
small-molecule inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 interaction (Shangary et al., 2008). We first
examined whether MI-219 induces p53, MDM2, p21 and Puma up-regulation in MM1s cells
after miR-192, miR-194 and miR-215 transfection. In cells with forced expression of
miR-192 and 215, p53 became detectable even in untreated cells (Figure 5A-5B) (p<0.05),
confirming previously published data in other cell lines (Georges et al., 2008; Braun et al.,
2008). p53 re-expression and subsequent p21 and Puma up-regulation was observed in these
cells and in miR-194 transfected cells, and is clearly visible following 24 hrs of 2.5 μM
MI-219 treatment (Figure 5A). In control cells (Scr) the treatment was ineffective (Figure
5A). Densitometric analysis of p53 and MDM2 protein levels was performed when cells
were treated for 24 hr with 2.5 μM, 5 μM and 10 μM MI-219 (Figure 5B). Confirming our
previous data, we observed higher p53 accumulation (≥2-fold increase, p<0.001) and
dramatic MDM2 down-regulation (≥3-fold decrease, p<0.001) in miRNA transfected cells
(Figure 5B). These opposing changes in MDM2 and p53 expression levels correlated with
higher activation of p53 down-stream targets, p21 and Puma (Figure 5A). Furthermore,
MI-219 induced higher caspase-3 activation in the presence of miR-192, miR-194 and
miR-215 (p<0.001) (Figure 5C). Next, we examined whether activation of p53 by MI-219
leads to apoptosis in MM cells. Indeed, treatment with MI-219 induced apoptosis as
revealed by Annexin V staining (Figure 5D). In cells transfected with a pool of miRNAs
MI-219 effectively (p<0.0002) induced apoptosis at 2.5 μM (27±3%), 5 μM (32±3%) while
the scrambled control did not. This effect was less significant when using MI-219 at 10 μM
(30±5%), though it was enhanced when treatment was combined with miRNAs (55±5%)
(Figure 5D). Increased concentration of MI-219 did not increase the apoptotic rate of

Because previous studies have shown that MI-219 achieved excellent oral availability, we
investigated if, in mouse xenograft models, the combined action of miRNAs and oral
MI-219 could suppress tumorigenicity of MM cells. 8×106 viable MM1s Gfp+/Luc+ cells
were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 40 nude mice. At 3 wks after injection a
group of 32 mice with comparable tumor size were selected and randomly divided into 4
groups for 4 independent experiments, using 8 mice for each combined treatment (Figure
5E). Specifically, we used the combination of oral treatment with 200 mg/kg MI-219 or
vehicle control (VE) once a day for 14 days plus direct tumor injection of double strand
RNA scrambled sequence (Scr) or a pool of pre-miR-192, 194 and 215 (miRs). Whereas the
VE-Scr treated tumors increased 2-fold in volume in 2 wks (from 5390 ± 993 mm3 to 13500
± 3200 mm3 [p<0.0001]), MI-219/Scr-treated tumors remained static in volume (5390 ± 993
mm3 to 5400 ± 1200 mm3) (Figure 5E). By contrast, mice treated with VE-miRs showed
∼1.5-fold reduction in tumor size (from 5390 ± 993 mm3 to 3700 ± 950 mm3 [p<0.01]). The
most effective combination was MI-219 plus miRs, where mice showed 5-fold reduced
tumor volumes (from 5390 ± 993 mm3 to 2100 ± 560 mm3 [p<0.01]) and >93% reduction
when compared to VE/Scr treatment (Figure 5E). These findings demonstrate proof-ofconcept for in vivo therapy of MM using combined miRNAs and an MDM2
pharmacological inhibitor.
miR-192 and miR-215, by antagonizing MDM2 down-regulation, target IGF-1 and IGF1-R
Since our data demonstrate that miR-192, miR-194 and miR-215 target MDM2, we sought
to determine if MDM2 substrates could also be affected. IGF-1R is a known target of
MDM2 ubiquitin ligase function (Girnita et al., 2003; Froment et al., 2008). Therefore, by
targeting MDM2, miR-192, 194 and 215 may indirectly influence the expression of IGF-1R.

In MM cells, IGF-1R and its ligand, IGF-1, are key factors in regulation of PC migration
into the bone marrow (Qiang et al., 2004; Tai et al., 2003). We noted that in WT TP53 MM
cells, p53 re-expression was strongly associated with down-regulation of IGF-1R and IGF-1
(Figure S5A and S5B) compared to mutant TP53 MM cells (Figures S5C and S5D). We
sought to determine the effect of miRNAs on IGF-1R and IGF-1 expression through
targeting MDM2. We found that in the presence of miR-192, 215 but not miR-194, IGF-1R
and IGF-1 protein levels decreased, as determined by Western blot analysis (Figure 6A).

Furthermore, inhibition of endogenous miR-192/215, using antisense oligonucleotides,
combined with 24 hrs of Nutlin-3a treatments increased both IGF-1R and IGF-1 levels in
MM1s cells (Figure 6B). This effect was not seen with miR-194. To determine if the
regulation of IGF-1 does affect IGF1R in MM cells, we silenced IGF-1 and observed upregulation of IGF-1R protein levels at 48 and 72 hrs post treatment (Figure 6C). This effect
was clearly different from that observed following miRNA transfection (Figure 6A). We
next tested whether miR-192 and 215 target IGF-1R and IGF-1 directly by generating
luciferase reporters containing their 3′ UTRs. Using Targetscan (Lewin et al., 2003) Pictar
(Krek et al., 2005) and RNA22 (Miranda et al., 2006) searches we, identified several MREs
for miR-192 and miR-215 but not for miR-194 in the 3′UTR of IGF-1R and IGF-1R
mRNAs (Figures 6D,E). Luciferase activity dropped 40–50% when these constructs were
co-transfected into MM1s cells with miR-192, 215 compared to miR-194 and Scr (Figures
6D, 6E, S5E-S5I). To determine if in freshly isolated CD-138+ PCs these miRNAs could
regulate IGF-1 and IGF-1R expression, we transfected miR-192 and 215 (pool) into PCs of
9 patients and we performed immunofluorescence analysis for IGF-1R and IGF-1 at 48 hrs.
We observed a significant decrease in IGF-1R and IGF-1 protein expression (Figures 6F,G).
Transfection efficiency was confirmed using RNA Fluorescent Oligo (Figure 6H). These
results indicate that miR-192 and miR-215 directly target IGF-1R and IGF-1 in MM.
miR-192 and 215 block MM migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given the known role of IGF-I and IGF-1R as anti-apoptotic factors and in MM migration
through endothelial barriers and bone marrow stroma (Qiang et al., 2004; Tai et al., 2003),
we sought to determine if miR-192 and 215 interfere with the chemotactic function of IGF-I
and block migration and invasion of MM cells. We first determined that miR-192 and 215
actions on the IGF-1 axis in MM affect both WT TP53 (MM1s) and mutant (RPMI-8226)
cell lines (Figure 7A) and that the down-regulation of both proteins critically affects S6 and
AKT phosphorylation in these cells. Next, we found that ectopic expression of miR-192 and
215 in NCI-H929 and RPMI-8226 IGF-1 treated cells was associated with significant
decrease in cell adhesion (Figure S6A,B), migration and tissue invasion compared to Scr
control. To this end, we used an intra-epithelial trans-well migration assay with IGF-1 at
various concentrations as attractant and two bone marrow-derived stromal cells, HS-5
(fibroblastlike) and HS-27A (epithelial-like) as cell layer. As shown in Figures 7B and S6C,
IGF-1 (50 ng/ml) stimulated migration of MM cells, MM1s and RPMI-8226. To further
examine the role of miRNA-192, 215 and 194 in MM cells, we investigated the effect of
these miRNAs on migration in vivo, using a previously described homing model (Roccaro et
al., 2008). Nine NOD-SCID mice (for each group) were intravenously injected with 8×106
of pre-miRNA-192–, 194 and 215 or Scr probe–transfected GFP+/Luc+MM1S cells. One
week later, mice were injected intravenously every week for 4 weeks with an individual
miRNA or Scr dissolved in PBS (10 μg for each mouse). After 5 wks the homed and
proliferated tumors were markedly suppressed in miRNA-treated mice compared to Scrtransfected MM cells (p<0.01) (Figure 7C). At 5 wks post-injection we first noted reduced
tumor progression, by bioluminescence imaging (Figure 7D). Mice injected with Scr–
transfected MM1s in addition to serial iv-injection with Scr showed significant tumor
growth, but tumor burden was significantly reduced in mice injected with pre-miR-194 and

was nearly nonexistent in mice injected with either pre-miR192 or pre-miR-215 (Figure
7C,D). In addition, through FACS analysis using human CD-138+ antibody we analyzed
bone marrow engraftment of these cells in injected NOD-SCID mice. We confirmed that
Scr-treated mice showed bone marrow engraftment of ∼25±15% of MM1s cells vs 4±2% for
miR-192 and 2±2% for miR-215 animals (Figure 7E). The in vivo action of miR-194 was
less effective, 12±3% of bone marrow engraftment MM1s cells compared to miR-192 and
215 but still higher than the Scr control (Figure 7E). These data indicate that miR-192, 215
but also miR-194 have therapeutic potential not only by affecting proliferation rates in MM
cells but also by affecting the homing and migration ability of MM cells.
Discussion

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Complex cytogenetic abnormalities and numeric chromosomal aberrations occur in virtually
all multiple myeloma, and in most, if not all, cases of MGUS (Kuehl and Bergsagel, 2002).
Paradoxically, mutations and/or deletion of TP53 occur in only a small percentage of
intramedullary MMs and not at all in MGUS (Chng et al., 2007). Several reports (Teoh et
al., 1997; Quesnel et al., 1994) and our data (Figure 4E) suggest that MDM2 overexpression in MMs, but not its gene amplification (Quesnel et al., 1994), could be
responsible for p53 inactivation in cells retaining functional p53 pathways. This supports the
idea that induction of p53 in this setting might be a suitable treatment for MM. There have
been a few reports concerning microRNA deregulation in MM and although not all reported
findings were in agreement, they confirmed that such deregulation is important in MM
pathogenesis (Pichiorri et al., 2008; Roccaro et al., 2009; Lionetti et al., 2009; Gutierrez et
al., 2010). Here, we studied the role of miRNAs in the p53 apoptotic pathway upon non
genotoxic activation of p53 in MM cells, using small molecular inhibitors of MDM2
(Nutlin-3a, MI-219). Upon p53 activation we identified two related microRNA clusters
located in regions considered important for MM (miR-194-2-192 at 11q13.1 and
miR-194-1-215 at 1q41.1) (Fonseca et al., 2009). Furthermore, the knowledge that miRNAs
coming from the same cluster can reinforce their action on the same cellular pathways
(Garofalo et al., 2009; Ventura et al., 2008), led us to study the molecular mechanisms
associated with activation of the p53 pathway by these miRNAs. Through characterization
of the miR-194-2-192 cluster promoter region and definition of a non canonical p53
consensus site we have shown that these miRNAs are direct p53 targets. In patient samples
the expression of these miRNAs changed during transition from normal PC, via MGUS to
intramedullary MM; these miRNAs were significantly down-regulated in a cohort of newly
diagnosed MMs vs MGUS; miR-192, 215 and 194 enhanced colony suppression, cell cycle
arrest or apoptosis in a p53-dependent manner. We also noted, as in the case of KMS28BM
cells, that their biological action could be associated with the MDM2 status in MM cells.
The short half-life of MDM2 protein (Marine et al., 2010) and difficulties in analyzing its
protein expression in MM cells without p53 activation, led to the demonstration that the
effect of these miRNAs on MDM2 was clearly detectable after treating WT TP53 MM cells
with combined Nutlin-3a and ectopic expression of the miRNAs. In fact, we observed that in
treated cells with enforced expression of these miRNAs MDM2 was dramatically downregulated at protein and mRNA levels and this down-regulation was inversely associated
with higher p53 expression and p21 activation (Figure 4A-4C). Luciferase assays using
plasmids harboring the MDM2 3-UTR sequence strongly confirmed that MDM2 is the
direct target of these miRNAs. In a subset of newly diagnosed MMs, elevated levels of
MDM2 mRNA were inversely associated with miR-192 expression. We proved, in vivo and
in vitro, that the combination of these miRNAs with p53 pharmacological activator
(MI-219), leading to MDM2 down-regulation and subsequent p53, p21 and Puma upregulation, could be a successful therapeutic strategy. In fact it produced anti-tumor results
that could not be achieved solely by increasing the drug concentration. We also found that
miR-192 and miR-215 expression, by overriding MDM2 ubiquitination of IGF-1R (Girnita

et al., 2003; Froment et al., 2008), directly targets the IGF-1 axis in MM cells, controlling
mobility and invasive properties of MM cells in vitro and in vivo. We propose a model in
which these miRNAs are: 1) regulators of the auto-regulatory loop, increasing the window
of time between p53 apoptotic action and p53 degradation by MDM2; and 2) at the same
time targeting the IGF axis, antagonizing the MDM2 ubiquitin ligase function on IGF-1R
(Figure 8).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

During Nutlin-3a treatment of primary CD-138+ PCs from MMs without TP53 deletion, we
noted that p21 activation, as well as re-expression of the three miRNAs, was consistent but
not uniform in all samples analyzed. Possibly mechanisms other than alterations to the TP53
gene could influence the sensitivity to MDM2 molecular inhibitors. In seeking an
explanation for the lack of expression of these miRNAs in MMs, we noted that the genes for
these miRNAs are located in chromosomal regions in MM that are normally characterized
by chromosome gain and translocations rather than deletions (Fonseca et al., 2009). We
then, explored the methylation status in the promoter of the miR-194-2-192 cluster. By
combined bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) we detected hypermethylation of the
promoter region of this cluster (Region R) (Figure S7A) in MM cell lines (Figure S7B).
Furthermore, treatment of MM cell lines with a demethylation agent (Azacytidine) increased
the expression of these miRNAs in WT TP53 MM cell lines (Figure S7C). Re-expression of
the SOCS-1 gene, known to be silenced by hypermethylation in MM cells (Galm et al.,
2002), served as internal control.
It is likely that the transition from MGUS to MM is favored by clonal selection of cells with
aberrant promoter methylation of the miR-194-2-192 cluster. This could be associated with a
decreasing ability of p53 to down-modulate MDM2 expression thus tipping the regulatory
balance in favor of MDM2 in MM cells. This proposed model (illustrated in Figure S7D)
will require further investigation.
Of note, monoallelic deletion of TP53 in MM, which often seems to occur without mutation
on the other allele, is associated with an extremely poor prognosis (Chng et al., 2007). This
supports the idea that a two-fold decrease in TP53 gene content is associated with tumor
progression, which supports the hypothesis that a partial lack of expression of these
miRNAs in MMs could create a p53 imbalance with direct biological consequences.
In summary, our results have defined a mechanism of p53 regulation through miRNAs
acting on MDM2 expression, providing the basis for the development of miRNA-targeted
therapies for MM, as illustrated in Figure 8.

Experimental Procedures
Collection of primary cells
33 newly diagnosed primary MM samples, 14 primary samples from monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and 5 primary samples from healthy
donors were obtained from bone marrow aspirates. Written informed consent was obtained
in keeping with institutional policies (IRB-approved procurement protocol (2000C0247) at
The Ohio State University and The University of Turin GIMEMA-MM-03-05, N.
EUDRACT 2005-004745-33). Three of the five healthy PCs used were purchased from
AllCells LLC. (Emeryville, CA).
Luciferase Assays
MM1s cells were cotransfected with 1 μg of pGL3 firefly luciferase reporter vector (see
luciferase reporter vector method supplementary information), 0.1 μg of the phRL-SV40
control vector (Promega), and 100 nM miRNA precursors (Ambion) using nucleoporation

(LONZA) Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V as previously described. Firefly and Renilla
luciferase activities were measured consecutively by using the Dual Luciferase Assay
(Promega) 24 hr after transfection. Each reporter plasmid was transfected at least twice (on
different days) and each sample was assayed in triplicate.
Mouse experiments
Animal studies were performed according to institutional guidelines. 1 × 106 of GFP/Luc +
MM1s cells were suspended in 0.10 ml of extracellular matrix gel (BD Biosciences) and the
mixture was injected subcutaneously into the right flank athymic nu/nu mice. 3 wks after
injection, mice with comparable size tumors were treated for 2 wks with a combination of
oral dose of MI-219 (200 mg/kg) or vehicle, once a day for 14 days and miRNAs or
scrambled sequence oligos (10ug) (Ambion), was injected directly into the tumors once a
week for 2 wks. For the NOD-SCID engraftment model Luc+/GFP+ MM.1S cells (8 × 106/
mouse) were injected into the tail vein of SCID mice (. Treatment started 7 days from tumor
cell inoculation, by weekly i.v. injections of miRNAs or scrambled sequence. RNA oligos
(Ambion) (10 μg) for four cycles (4 wks total). For more details see in vivo experiments
supplemental data.

Transfection method for primary cells and MM cell lines
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

CD-138+ PCs obtained from new diagnosed MM patients and isolated as previously
described were transfected by using nucleoporation (LONZA) Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V
(Cat#VCA-1003). MM1s, NCI-H929 cell lines were transfected by using using
nucleoporation (LONZA) Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (Cat#VCA-1003). Instead for U266,
KMS-28BM and RPMI-8226 Cell Line Nucleofector Kit C (Cat#VCA-1004) was used.
Specifically for primary cells 1 ×106 CD-138+ PCs were resuspended in 100 μl of V
solution and 100 nM miRNA precursors (Ambion) was used for the transfection reaction.
For more details see transfection method for primary cells supplemental information.

Target Screening
In this study, we used three publicly available search engines for target prediction to obstain
the putative targets: TargetScan (Release 2.1), http://genes.mit.edu/targetscan, Pictar,http://
pictar.bio.nyu.edu and Rna22, http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/rna22_targets.html. For
RNA22 predicted sites we considered only the heteroduplex with a folding energy >-27
Kcal/mol (Figures S8B-8E) because we were not able to confirm by luciferase assay the
interactions between target gene and miRNAs with a folding energy less that -27 Kcal/mol
(data not shown).

Figure 1. Identification of p53-regulated miRNAs in MM cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A) Overview of two-way (genes against samples) hierarchical cluster (Euclidean distance)
of 6 MM cell lines in duplicate using the genes that vary the most between samples. As
shown, the clustering is mainly determined by the presence of WT TP53 expression (NCIH929, MM 1s and KMS28BM) or mutant/null TP53 (U266, RPMI-8226, JJN3) in the cell
lines. In magnification are reported the miRNAs up-regulated more than 3-fold in WT TP53
cell lines with p< 0.001. See also figure S1 and table S1. B)-Overview of two-way of MM1s
cells treated with 10 μM Nutlin-3a overnight (biological quadruplicate) and with DMSO
(biological triplicate) using the genes that vary the most between samples. As shown, the
clustering is mainly determined from the Nutlin-3a treatments and DMSO treatment. Color
areas indicate relative expression of each gene with respect to the gene median expression
(red above, green below the median value, and black, samples with signal intensity to
background of 2 or less). See also figure S1 and table S2. Western blot analysis of p53,
MDM2, phosphor(p)-MDM2, c-MYC, p21 and Gapdh (C) and time course of CDKN1A
mRNA expression by RT-PCR in Nutlin-3a treated (10μM) MM1s cells (D). The PCR
products were normalized to ACTIN expression. Values represent mean observed in 4
different studies ± SD. (E) Kinetics of miR-194, miR-192, miR-215 and miR-34a in MM1s
cells after Nutli-3a treatment, measured by qRT-PCR and Northern blot analysis. Lines
represent relative fold-changes between DMSO and Nutlin-3a treatment ± SD. RNU44
(qRT-PCR) and RNU6B (Northern blot) expression was used for normalization. See also

healthy, MGUS and MM samples (see Table S3) were determined by Taqman q-RT PCR
assay. Each data sample was normalized to the endogenous reference RNU44 and RNU48
by use of the 2– ct method. The relative expression values were used to design box and
whisker plots. Dots in the boxes indicate outlier points. Kruskal-Wallis analysis assessed
that the 3 miRNAs were differentially expressed among MGUS samples versus MM PCs
samples of the Bartlett test p ≤.001.
