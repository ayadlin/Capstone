ABSTRACT
Residual cancer cells and subsequent tumor relapse is an obstacle for curative
cancer treatment. Tumor necrosis therapy (TNT) has recently been developed to
cause residual tumor regression or destruction. Here, we exploited the avidity of the
sennidin A (SA) tracer and radioiodinated SA (131I-SA) to necrotic tumors in order
to further empower TNT. We showed high uptake and prolonged retention of SA in
necrotic tumors and a quick clearance in other non-targeted tissues including the liver.
On SPECT-CT images, tumor mass appeared persistently as a hotspot. Based on the
prominent targetability of 131I-SA to the tumor necrosis, we designed a combinational
theragnostic modality. The vascular disrupting agent (VDA) combretastatin A4
phosphate (CA4P) was used to cause massive tumor necrosis, which formed the target
of 131I-SA that subsequently killed the residual tumor cells by cross-fire irradiation
of beta particles. Consequently, 131I-SA combined with CA4P significantly inhibited
tumor growth, extended tumor doubling time and prolonged mean animal survival.
In conclusion, 131I-SA in combination with necrosis inducing drugs/therapies may
generate synergetic tumoricidal effects on solid malignancies by means of primary
debulking and secondary cleansing process.

INTRODUCTION

To tackle the residual tumor, the search for efficient
necrosis targeting methods may present a breakthrough
with great interests. Necrotic tissue, omnipresent in
all fast-growing solid tumors [3, 4] and after certain
anticancer therapies [5-7], may serve as an anchoring point
for a directed tumor therapeutic strategy. Moreover, based
on the underlying principle that radiation can be delivered
in a targeted way by attaching a certain radionuclide to a
molecule or antibody, which then selectively accumulates
in tumor necrosis and emits radiation to kill and/or restrain

Cancer remains a major cause of human suffering and
death worldwide. New developments of radiotherapy and
chemotherapy have made the progress in cancer treatment
[1, 2], but cancer cure is still difficult to achieve except
for the early radical surgery. The main reason is, after the
above therapies, the presence of residual cancer cells and
subsequent tumor recurrence and metastasis, which forms a
hindrance for clinical and experimental oncology.

adjacent residual cancer cells. Such a design belongs to
internal molecular targeted radiotherapy [8].
Tumor necrosis therapy (TNT) is a promising
anticancer strategy, which was first described by Epstein et
al [4, 9]. A specific antibody agent 131I-chTNT targeting the
nuclear antigens in degenerating cells has been applied in
clinical treatment. It carries therapeutic radionuclide 131I to
necrotic areas of solid tumors and exerts cytotoxicities to
remnant viable tumor cells [9] to create new necrosis, then
subsequent doses of 131I-chTNT will be able to extend to
these new areas of degeneration, causing a “gangrene-like”
effect throughout the tumor so as to therapy. However, so
far the clinical therapeutic results appeared unsatisfactory,
and the possible explanation is the macromolecule
immunogenicity of monoclonal antibodies [10].
Hypericin
(4,5,7,4’,5’,7’-Hexahydroxy-2,2’dimethylnaphthodianthrone, Hyp), a small molecule
compound, was recognized as a prominent necrosis-avid
agent [5, 7, 11, 12]. Studies proved radioiodinated Hyp was
also found to selectively concentrate in necrotic tissues
[13, 14] and sustain a long time [15]. Moreover, 131I-Hyp,
a prominent necrosis targeting agent carrying therapeutic
iodine-131 with high sensitivity and specificity, has been
investigated on different types of tumors with preliminary
promising outcomes [15, 16].
However, Hyp is labile due to its big conjugate
system, especially under light [17]. Besides, with nearly
planar conformation, Hyp is poorly soluble and forms
nonfluorescent aggregates in aqueous environment [18],
which strongly hindered its selective accumulation in
necrotic tumor [19]. The coarse aggregates are intercepted
by pulmonary capillary network and small ones are
cleaned by reticuloendothelial system and substantially
retained in the liver and spleen.
Sennidin A (SA, Figure 1B) and Hyp show the
same skeleton with a condensation of two molecules
of anthraquinone. However, SA, a kind of median
dianthrone derived from the Cassia L., Senna [20], is free
to rotate through a single connecting bond, and spatially
arranged in cross with steric hindrance (Figure 1C). This
characteristic improves the stability and solubility of the
molecule to prevent the formation of aggregations. The
necrosis avidity of 131I-SA was first investigated in rat
models of myocardial infarction with infarct/myocardium
distribution ratio of 11.9 [21].
In view of the similar necrosis affinity but better
stability and solubility with SA/131I-SA relative to Hyp,
we hypothesized a combined targeted anticancer strategy,
in which a vascular disrupting agent (VDA) [22, 23]
first selectively causes massive tumor necrosis that is
then targeted by tumoricidal 131I-SA, which irradiates
the residual cancer cells through constant cross-fire
beta particles to achieve local control or cancer cure.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Meanwhile, the gamma ray emitted by 131I-SA enables
scintiscan, hence a theragnostic approach.
To validate this hypothesis, we performed the
animal experiments to gain insight into the necrosis
avidity or targetability of SA/131I-SA by analyzing the
biodistribution, in vivo single photon emission computer
tomography-computed tomography (SPECT-CT) imaging,
autoradiography, and fluoromicroscopy in rodent tumor
models. We further investigated the anticancer efficacy and
safety of 131I-SA as a radiopharmaceutical in combination
with a VDA combretastatin A4 phosphate (CA4P) in mice
with subcutaneous S180 tumor.

RESULTS
Animal models
Bilateral S180 tumor-bearing mice models and
unilateral W256 tumor-bearing rat models were established
successfully, and they survived the surgery, anesthesia
and imaging procedures without any drug administrationrelated deaths.

Radiolabeling and in vitro stability
The percentage radioactivity of 131I-SA relative to all
radioiodine activity was greater than 95% as determined
with HPLC, and in vitro stabilities of 131I-SA stored in rat
serum at 37°C was excellent with RCP over 95% up to
8 days.

SPECT-CT image
After SPECT-CT imaging in vivo, unilateral tumors
in rats were visible as hotspots from day 2 till 8 after the
injection of 131I-SA, which became brighter and more
focused as a function of time. At day 2 post injection,
the whole bodies of rats showed uptakes of 131I-SA.
However, at day 4, marked tumor uptake of 131I-SA and
a lower amount of radioactivity in the livers was seen
(Figure 2-A2). Up to 8 days (Figure 2-B2), except tumor,
all other tissues had no obvious uptakes.

Whole-body biodistribution of 131I-SA
Relatively high uptakes of 131I-SA were found in the
liver and kidney at 4 h post injection, as well as necrotic
tumor (Figure 3A). However, except the necrotic tumor,
all organs and tissues revealed obvious clearance of
radioactivity up to 120 h. The radioactivity quantification
of dissected tumor showed high uptake in the necrosis
with a necrosis-to-tumor activity ratio of 2.4, 3.2, 4.1 and
7.5 at 4, 24, 48 and 120 h, respectively.

uptake was located mainly in the necrotic tumor regions
relative to that in viable tumor, based on the distinction
between the necrosis and viable tumor proven by H&E
stained slices (Figure 3B-a1, b1, c1 and d1). By a semiquantitative autoradiography examination, radioactivity
ratios of necrosis over liver amounted up to 5.2, 19.8, 23.8

and 31.2 at 4, 24, 48 and 120 h, respectively. The necrotic/
viable tumor ratios quantified by autoradiography were
higher than by gamma counting. This was due to the fact
that viable cells are intermixed with necrotic cells, making
separative sampling of necrotic and viable tumor tissues
for gamma counting very difficult. Besides, radioactivity
inside the necrosis was often inhomogeneous due to
relatively poor blood perfusion

The necrotic-viable tumor ratios quantified by fluorointensity
and autoradiography were consistent, which likely endows
SA and its radioiodinated analogues with necrosis avidity.
This finding suggests that necrosis affinity is a new inherent
property of SA, which can be utilized in different fields
without or with linking to various isotopes.

Intratumoral localization of SA

Survival

To visualize in greater details the selective retention
of SA in tumor necrosis over a longer period, intratumoral
distribution was analyzed by fluorescence microscopy up
to 120 h. Relative to those on the unstained slides (Figure
4-A1, B1, C1, D1), necrotic and viable tumor tissues were
distinguished by H&E staining (Figure 4A2, B2, C2, D2),
showing different patterns on the microscopic images.
Fluoromicroscopic images revealed distinct fluorescence
intensity between necrotic and viable tumor at different
time points (Figure 4A3, B3, C3, D3), with increasing
necrosis-liver ratios of 7.7, 21.6, 30.1 and 42.3 at 4,
24, 48 and 120 h, respectively. At 4 h post injection, the
necrotic areas close to the viable tumor showed strong
red fluorescence, but the necrotic regions distal to viable
tumor showed moderate uptake of SA and viable tumor
displayed the lowest uptake (Figure 4A3). Up to 48 h,
fluorescence intensity was progressively increasing in
necrotic areas, whereas rapidly descending in viable tumor.
At 120 h, the fluorescence intensity decreased in tumor
necrotic region, but with an increased necrosis to liver ratio.

Only one episode of 131I-SA combined with CA4P
notably prolonged the survival of tumor-bearing mice,
with the median survival of 34, 22, 23 and 20 days in
group A, B, C and D, respectively (Figure 5). Significant
differences were showed between group A and group B,
C or D in survival curves (P < 0.001), but no significant
difference was found among group B, C and D (P > 0.05).

In vivo MRI
Tumors appeared iso- and hyperintense on T1- and
T2-weighted MR images. On CE-T1 images, subcutaneous
S180 tumors were enhanced after Gd-DOTA injection,
suggesting their hypervascular nature. In group A and B,
after injection of CA4P, a non-enhanced central region was
surrounded by a thin rim enhancement on CE-T1 images,
indicating the presence of massive necrosis and minimum
viable tumor (Figure 6A2, B2), but the tumor necrosis
region in group A (Figure 6A3) persisted to increase

after injection of 131I-SA for a longer time compared to
group B (Figure 6-B3). In group D, there existed patches
of spontaneous necrosis, which were different from the
tumors of group A. The borders between necrotic and
viable tumor in 4 groups were clearly distinguishable
on H&E stained microscopy (Figure 6A6, B6, C6, D6).
In group A, exposure of tumor cells to 131I-radiation
caused marked cell death, characterized by extensive and
thorough intratumoral damage (Figure 6A5), but group D
presented nests of viable tumor cells intermixed with foci
of spontaneous tumor necrosis (Figure 6D5), corresponded
to MRI manifestations (Figure 6A2-A4 and D2-D4).

Liver and kidney toxicity

BW at baseline in group A, B, C and D was 35.7 ±
2.3, 35.6 ± 0.6, 36.1 ± 1.7 and 35.9 ± 1.6 g respectively
(P > 0.05). Mice in all groups presented a tendency of
gaining weight along with tumor growth. On day 15,
the BW of group B (44.3 ± 2.1 g), C (45.6 ± 3.7 g) and
D (49.5 ± 2.4 g) showed obvious increase, relative to the
small change in group A (36.8 ± 1.6 g). However, the
mean BW of group A reached 41.8 ± 3.3 g on day 24,
which was significantly increased compared with that at
baseline (P < 0.01).

Function indexes of liver (AST, ALT) and kidney
(BUN, CER) in the serum taken from therapy mice were
measured to investigate whether 131I-SA may damage liver
and kidney due to high uptakes. As shown in Table 1,
values of ALT (P < 0.01) and AST (P < 0.05) in group  A
and B showed significant difference as compared to
group  D, respectively. However, liver function indexes
revealed no obvious difference between group C and D
(P > 0.05). This suggests that the raise of liver function
indexes in group A and B might be caused by CA4P
but not 131I-SA. The BUN and CER values displayed
no significant difference between group A, B, C and D
(P > 0.05). Moreover, histopathologic analysis of liver and
kidney revealed no signs of tissue damage.

DISCUSSION

I-SA from non-targeting organs such as blood, kidney, but
a sustained increasing uptake in tumor necrosis, resulting
in a continuous increase in necrosis-to-liver activity ratio
over 120 h. Although relatively high radioactivity was
shown in liver and kidney at early time, it was eliminated
with a short biological half-life via urine and faeces (data
unpublished), which minimizes the potential hepatobiliary
and renal injuries. Moreover, 131I-SA is taken up less in
lung and spleen compared with 131I-Hyp at 24 h post
injection [15], suggesting that SA may overcome the
shortcoming with Hyp that, due to poor solubility, forms
aggregates cleaned by reticuloendothelial system leading
to accumulation in the spleen and lung [5, 13, 24-26].
Besides, 131I-SA showed favorable pharmacokinetics

In this study, SA was efficiently labeled with
131-iodine at a high conjugation rate by Iodogen coating
method [24, 25]. It showed prominent targetability with
a high sustaining tumor necrosis-liver ratio and quick
clearance from non-targeting tissues. Furthermore, 131I-SA
as a targeted radiopharmaceutical combined with CA4P
first demonstrated superb effects for imaging diagnosis
and therapy in rodent solid tumor models.
All targeted cancer therapies aim to maximize
tumor destruction while minimize side-effects. In this
study, quantitative gamma counting of radioactivity in
sampled organs revealed a progressive clearance of 131

with 11.8 h of blood half-life in healthy rats (unpublished
data), whereas 131I-Hyp displayed a long blood half-life
of 30.5 h [27]. SA/131I-SA were observed to substantially
accumulated in necrotic areas of the tumor at 4 h post
injection in our study, whereas 131I-Hyp was located
mainly in viable tumor tissue and little activity could be
detected in necrotic tissue. Only 24 h later, 131I-Hyp was
transferred to the necrotic region with a time-dependent
uptake [14]. With the characteristic early distribution
of a high concentration in necrotic areas, 131I-SA might
be superior to 131I-Hyp in the dual targeting therapy in
combination with CA4P. Indeed, better accumulation
of SA in the necrotic tumor would lower the damage to
normal tissues. Besides, SA or its radiolabeled derivatives
could be more promising for early imaging diagnosis of
myocardial infarction [28, 29].
Early detection of cancer through screening
based on imaging is probably the major contributor
to a reduction in mortality for certain cancers. Each
technique has its own unique applications, advantages,
and limitations. Compared with other imaging modalities,
PET features high sensitivity and specificity. High tissue
radioactivity after administration of 18F-FDG corresponds
to increased glucose uptake and consumption. Tumor cells
are generally metabolically active and will take up more
glucose than normal cells. However, PET tends to work
better for higher grade tumors and metastasis, as welldifferentiated tumors have less metabolic activity. Besides,
since inflammation shows as "hot" on a PET scan, it is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more difficult to differentiate inflammation from tumors.
Therefore, new targeted imaging need to be developed
to provide complementary information for improved
diagnostic accuracy. In the experiment, we chose CA4P
first to cause necrosis in the tumor as the target of 131
I-SA with high necrosis targetability for sensitively
imaging the tumor under treatment. Combining anatomical
CT imaging and functional SPECT imaging, we found
that substantial 131I-SA concentrated in the tumor mass
as a hotspot. SPECT-CT images on day 8 showed a very
intense accumulation of 131I-SA exclusively in the tumor
areas, which not only demonstrates the strong diagnostic
capacity of 131I-SA for detecting tumor over a relatively
long period after injection, but also reveals a good stability
of radioiodinated SA exerting its persistent targeted
radiotherapeutic effect. As clearly shown in this study, the
avidity of SA for necrosis offers the opportunity to exploit
the compound as a carrier for theragnostic utilities.
As proposed by Blagosklonny MV, tissue-specific
targets and combination of potent therapeutic strategies
with synergy or selectivity may be effective ways to
control tumor [30]. Necrosis tissue appears a perfect
tissue-specific target for tumor therapy, which finds a
broad tumor spectrum for plenty of indications. In our
study, sequential combination of targeted therapies by
non-overlapping complementary mechanisms achieved
synergetic outcomes with minimal radiation exposure to
healthy tissues due to the high target-to-nontarget ratio.
Actually, beyond whether drug combination is synergistic,
2942

additive or antagonistic, what is essential is that drug
combination should be more toxic towards cancer cells
compared to normal cells[31].
131
I-SA has achieved encouraging results in
sensitivity and specificity of necrosis targeting by
evaluation of biodistribution and in vivo imaging in rodent
tumor models. Based on these prominent outcomes, we
investigated the potential of 131I-SA as a radiotherapeutic
agent combined with CA4P, which non-invasively created
tumor necrosis. CA4P as a vascular disrupting agent
selectively shuts down tumor vasculature and deprives
the tumor of blood and oxygen supply, subsequently leads
to rapid massive intratumoral necrosis [32, 33], which
forms as the next target. Hours after CA4P injection,
SA as a small molecular necrosis-avid agent carries and
delivers a therapeutic radionuclide iodine-131 to the prior
existing or induced necrotic regions in the tumor and kills
neighboring residual tumor cells by crossfire radiation.
Therefore, the mean survival time and tumor DT of
group A was prolonged significantly (P < 0.05) relative to
group B, C and D, which indicated an excellent antitumoral
outcome of 131I-SA to prevent rapid tumor re-growth as
seen in group B, C and D. Moreover, the consistent tumor
volume inhibition in group A could be monitored by MRI.
Neither of the two targeting molecules (CA4P and 131ISA) alone exerted sufficient therapeutic effects to delay
tumor growth as evident by group B and C. The possible
explanation may be the time coordination and synergistic
effect between CA4P and 131I-SA administration. CA4P
with the dose of 10 mg/kg can kill the tumor from the
inside out, leaving layers of remaining viable cancer cells
about 20-100 µm of thickness [34], which facilitates the
accumulated 131I-SA in the necrotic tissue bordering the
viable tumor to kill remaining cancer cells. It is noticed
that the treatment was not effective late after a single dose
of 131I-SA in group A. This might be due to the following
reasons: 1) the remaining tumor cells repopulate after
CA4P therapy; 2) there is no successive radioactivity
that can continuously localize into the outstretched new
necrotic tissues induced by the single dose of 131I-SA; and
3) physical decay of 8 days with radioiodine-131 inside
necrosis. It is believed that consecutive 131I-SA doses and
combination with antiangiogenic agents can be promising
in future studies to further improve the anticancer efficacy
or realizing tumor eradication.
131
I-chTNT, a monoclonal antibody based agent with
specificity and long retention time in necrotic tumor, has
been approved for the treatment of advanced lung cancer
in China [35]. In our study, small molecular radiolabeled
SA also demonstrated peculiar necrosis avidity by showing
high concentration in tumor necrosis with consequent
theragnostic effects on bilateral S180 tumor-bearing mice.
Moreover, by analysis of blood routine of treated mice, 131
I-SA did not show myelosuppression, which often happens
after 131I-chTNT treatment and is an important doselimiting factor of 131I-chTNT [35]. In addition, no adverse
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects were detected after 131I-SA injection by analysis
of hepatic and renal function indexes and histopathologic
examination. Comparing to the intratumoral use of
131
I-chTNT [36], 131I-SA may be more advantageous due
to its fast diffusion through tumor as a small molecule,
and its observed superior in vivo targetability may be
attributed to the more favorable pharmacokinetics, i.e. a
small–molecular weight (<1 kDa) necrosis-avid compound
versus a macromolecular (>30 kDa) monoclonal antibody
applied for radioimmunotherapy [37].
In conclusion, characteristic of better solubility
and stability, lower toxicity and earlier distribution in
necrosis, radioiodinated SA shows prominent targetability
to necrotic tumor, which allows targeted radiodiagnosis and
radiotherapy for residual tumor on top of a prior necrosisinducing treatment. Thus, with further development and
optimization, a new horizon of improved cancer treatability,
detectability or even curability can be anticipated.

MATERIAL AND METHOD
Animals and tumor models
All the animal experiments and husbandry were
approved and supervised by the institutional animal
care and research advisory committee. Kunming mice
(26–28g) and SD rats (250~300g) were provided by the
Experimental Animal Center, Jiangsu Province Academy
of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.
S180 tumor cells (2 × 106) were inoculated subcutaneously
to the bilateral flank regions of mice, and W256 tumor
cells (2 × 106) were inoculated subcutaneously to the
unilateral flank region of rats. Tumor growth was
regularly measured and calculated with the formula: tumor
volume = (short dimension)2 × (long dimension) × 1/2.
Model mice and rats were used when the tumor volume
reached 0.3 cm3 and 2.5 cm3 at 2 and 3 weeks after
inoculation, respectively.

Drug preparation and radiolabeling
SA with a purity > 98%, was obtained by hydrolyzing
sennoside A, which was separated from Senna angustifolia
(TengWang pharmaceutical co. Ltd, Haozhou, China,
Figure 1A). CA4P (HuaMei technology Co., Ltd, Wuhan,
China), was diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
solution (2.5 mg/ml). Sodium iodide (Na131I) was supplied
by HTA Co., Ltd, Beijing, China. The specific activity was
740 MBq/mL and the radionuclidic purity was > 99%.
The Iodogen coating method was used for
radioiodination of SA to form 131I-SA. SA was dissolved
in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) to 2 mg/ml solution.
Radioiodination was conducted by adding SA and Na131
I solutions (volume ratio, 4:1) into Iodogen tube and
adjusting pH value with PBS. The mixture was shaken and
incubated for 90 min at 45°C, and terminated by removal

of reaction mixture. Radiochemical purity (RCP) of 131
I-SA was determined by HPLC. The 131I-SA preparations
were formulated in water/polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG
400) mixtures (4:1, v/v).

the necrotic and viable tumor, distinguished based on the
histological examination of the H&E stained slices, was
estimated by manually drawing regions of interest. Digital
light units (DLU) per mm2, corrected for background, were
then calculated using Optiquant software. Autoradiographic
images of liver tissue, showing homogeneous tracer
distribution, were taken as a reference.

In vitro stability
I-SA was incubated in rat serum (volume ratio,
1:20) at 37°C. And then radiolabeling stability was
determined by HPLC at the time points of 0.5 h, 12 h, 1d,
2d, 4d, 8d, respectively.
131

Intratumoral localization of SA
Twelve S180 tumor-bearing mice were randomly
divided into four groups for assessing intratumoral
fluorescence intensity, and sacrificed at 4, 24, 48 and
120 h (n = 3, each time point) after intravenous injection
of SA (10 mg/kg). Tumors and liver were excised and cut
into cryostat sections (5 um). These slices were examined
using a fluorescence microscopy (Axio Primo Vert A1,
Carl Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany), and subsequently
stained with H&E. With necrotic and viable tumor areas
distinguished by H&E-stained slices, relative fluorescence
intensity of the necrotic to viable tumor at each time point
were obtained by manually drawing ROI using a KS
imaging software system (Zen2011 Vision, Carl Zeiss,
Hallbergmoos, Germany). Ratios of fluorescence densities
in the different regions were then calculated. Fluorescence
images of liver slices, showing homogeneous fluorescence
distribution, were taken as a reference.

SPECT-CT imaging on tumor-bearing rats
The thyroid of W256 tumor-bearing rats (n = 5) was
blocked with Lugol’s solution (1.2 g/L) in their drinking
water 3 days before and 8 days after the treatment. CA4P
was i.v. injected at 10 mg/kg, and 24 h later 131I-SA was
i.v. injected at 18.5 MBq/kg. A variable-angle dual detector
SPECT with 16-slice CT (Symbia T; Siemens Medical
Systems, Chicago, IL) was used to scan the rats after 131
I-SA injection on day 2, 4, 8. Rats were anesthetized
(chloral hydrate, 0.3 g/kg) and secured to the head holder of
the patient bed in supine position. Anterior and tomographic
images were collected using the following acquisition
parameters: static image matrix size 128×128, acquisition
count limit 50000, SPECT tomographic image matrix
64×64, and continuous acquisition 15 s/frame×24 frames.

Combinational therapy protocols

Whole-body biodistribution of 131I-SA

Forty S180 tumor-bearing mice with their thyroid
being blocked by Lugol’s solution were randomly divided
into the following four groups (n = 10, each): group A of
dual-targeting treatment received i.v. injection of CA4P
(10 mg/kg), and 24 h later, 131I-SA (185 MBq/kg); group
B of CA4P controls received CA4P and solvent of 131
I-SA; group C of 131I-SA controls received 131I-SA and
solvent of CA4P; group D of dual vehicle controls only
received solvents of the two drugs. Their health, activity
level, and body weight (BW) were recorded daily. MRI
was performed in vivo to monitor and quantify tumor
volume and necrosis every four days. Analysis of blood
routine was performed with an automatic biochemical
analyzer (Modular DP, Roche Co. Germany) before and
at two weeks after drug injection, and functional indexes
of the liver (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase, ALT and AST) and kidney (blood urea
nitrogen and creatinine, BUN and CRE) were examined
3 weeks post injection. At endpoint, animal survival was
analyzed, and tumors, liver and kidney were excised for
postmortem histopathology verification. Besides, the
tumors were weighed and measured using a vernier caliper.

Twenty-four S180 tumor-bearing mice with their
thyroid being blocked by Lugol’s solution were received
i.v. injection of 131I-SA (18.5 MBq/kg) and sacrificed at 4,
24, 48, 120 h (n = 6, each time point) post injection. At
each time point, necrotic and viable tumor, blood, heart,
lung, liver, stomach, spleen, small intestines, kidney,
muscle, thyroid gland were sampled. Tissue samples were
weighted and radioactivity was measured with an automatic
γ-counter (SN-695; Hesuo Rihuan photoelectric instrument,
Shanghai, China). The results, corrected for background
radiation and physical decay, were expressed as percentage
of the injected dose per gram of tissues (% ID/g).

Autoradiography
Liver and tumor blocks were sampled, imbedded in
medium (Tissue-Tek medium, Miles Inc., Elkhart, USA)
and frozen in the Cryotome (Shandon FSE, Thermo Fisher
Scientific Co., USA). Sections (50 µm) were cut and
exposed for 24 h to a high performance storage phosphor
screen (Super resolution screen, Canberra-Packare, Ontario,
Canada). Using a Phosphor Imager scanner (CycloneTM,
Canberra-Packard), the screen was read and the images
were processed with OptiquantTM software. Afterwards, the
same sections were stained with hematoxylin–eosin (H&E)
and digitally photographed. Relative tracer concentration in

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI was performed using a clinical 1.5 T whole
body MRI scanner (Echo speed, GE Co., USA) with a
2944

Oncotarget

wrist coil for mouse studies. The mouse was anesthesized
with an animal anesthesia machine (Matrx VMR,
GENE&I, Beijing, China), and placed supinely in a
plastic holder. T1- and T2-weighted spin-echo multislice transverse images were acquired, and contrast
enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1W) images were obtained
immediately after injection of Gd-DOTA (Dotarem,
Guerbet, France) via a caudal vein at 0.2 mmol/kg.
Quantifications of tumor area were measured by
manually delineating the outline of the tumor mass on
T2-weighted MRI slices. Tumor volume was calculated
with the equation: tumor volume = Σ (tumor area on
each slice × slice thickness). Tumor doubling time (DT)
was calculated based on the formula: DT = (T - T0) ×
log2 / (logV - logV0), where (T - T0) indicates the time
interval between two measurements, V0 and V denote the
tumor volume at the two points of measurement [38]. On
CE-T1 images, the area of central nonenhancing region
was delineated to estimate necrosis. The ratios of necrosis
were defined as the volume of necrosis over that of entire
tumor, i.e. necrosis ratio = Σ (area of necrosis × slice
thickness) / (area of whole tumor × slice thickness) ×100%.
