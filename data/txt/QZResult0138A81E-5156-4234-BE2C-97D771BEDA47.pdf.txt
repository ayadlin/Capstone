Vitamin D3 Enhances the Apoptotic Response of Epithelial
Tumors to Aminolevulinate-Based Photodynamic Therapy
Sanjay Anand1,2, Clara Wilson2, Tayyaba Hasan3, and Edward V. Maytin1,2,3

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy, mediated by exogenously administered aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT), followed by
exposure to a laser or broadband light source, is a promising modality for treatment of many types of cancers;
however, it remains inadequate to treat large, deep, solid tumors. In this article, we report that calcitriol, the
active form of vitamin D3, can be administered before ALA as a nontoxic preconditioning regimen to markedly
increase the efficacy of ALA-PDT. Using mouse models of squamous cell skin cancer for preclinical proof of
concept, we showed that calcitriol, delivered topically or intraperitoneally, increased tumoral accumulation of
the PDT-activated ALA product protoporphyrin-IX (PpIX) up to 10-fold, mainly by altering expression of the
porphyrin-synthesis enzymes coproporphyrinogen oxidase (increased) and ferrochelatase (decreased). Calcitriol-pretreated tumors underwent enhanced apoptotic cell death after ALA-based PDT. Mechanistic studies
have documented activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, with specific cleavage of caspase-8 and
increased production of TNF-a in tumors preconditioned by calcitriol treatment before receiving ALA-PDT.
Very low doses of calcitriol (0.1–1 mg/kg body weight) were sufficient to elicit tumor-selective enhancement to
ALA-PDT efficacy, rendering toxicity concerns negligible. Our findings define a simple, nontoxic, and highly
effective preconditioning regimen to enhance the response of epithelial tumors to ALA-PDT, possibly
broadening its clinical applications by selectively enhancing accumulation of photosensitizer PpIX together
with TNF-a in tumors. Cancer Res; 71(18); 6040–50. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that
combines a photosensitizer, light, and oxygen to achieve
selective cell killing (1, 2). PDT offers the advantage of dual
targeting, because both the photosensitizer and the visible
light can be effectively localized to the tumor (1). Excellent
selectivity can be achieved with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA;
ALA), a small-molecule precursor for the synthesis of endogenous porphyrins, most notably protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)
within cells (3). Because PpIX, not ALA, is the actual photosensitizer and because pathways that regulate ALA uptake and
conversion into PpIX are generally more active in tumor cells
than in normal cells, tumor-selective PpIX accumulation to
very high levels can be obtained (4). PDT, mediated by
exogenously administered aminolevulinic acid (ALA-PDT),

has proven clinically useful for wide-field treatment of carcinoma in situ of the skin (4–7) and cervix (8). ALA-PDT is also
useful for image-guided surgical resection of urinary tract
dysplasia (9) and high-grade gliomas in the brain (10, 11).
However, when employed as a monotherapy, ALA-PDT
remains unsatisfactory for treatment of large and deep
tumors, with incomplete response rates and recurrence rates
that are often less than ideal (reviewed in ref. 4).
To improve the efficacy of ALA-PDT, our goal has been to
develop new combination regimens based on the observation
that certain pharmacologic agents, which we call "differentiating agents," can enhance PpIX accumulation in a variety
of epithelial cancer cells (12–14). For example, we recently
reported that methotrexate, administered systemically as a
3-day preconditioning regimen prior to ALA-PDT, significantly enhances the accumulation of PpIX within squamous tumor
cell lines both in vitro and in vivo (14, 15). Remarkably,
methotrexate exerts these effects at subnanomolar concentrations (i.e., 100- to 1,000-fold lower than those typically used
in the clinic; refs. 14, 15), clearly too low to be tumoricidal yet
sufficient to trigger differentiation in choriocarcinoma cells
(16, 17), normal keratinocytes (18), and A431 carcinoma cells
(15). At these same low levels, methotrexate was shown to
enhance PpIX accumulation through a mechanism involving
increased expression of coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPO),
one of the porphyrin-synthetic enzymes (15).
In the current article, another class of molecule, vitamin D, is
shown to selectively enhance PDT by preferentially increasing

Calcitriol and Photodynamic Therapy of Squamous Carcinoma

PpIX accumulation in preneoplastic and neoplastic cells
in vivo, while causing very little damage to normal tissue.
Vitamin D belongs to a family of steroid hormones that
regulate bone and mineral metabolism, calcium homeostasis,
and cellular differentiation (reviewed in refs. 19–21). Although
pathways for synthesis and processing of the various isoforms
of vitamin D are rather complex, it is clear that the major
isoform that interacts with nuclear receptors and mediates
hormonal effects at the end organs is the trihydroxylated
molecule 1a,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3 (or calcitriol; ref. 20).
The first indication that vitamin D might be useful for enhancing PDT was our finding that calcitriol and synthetic vitamin D
analogues can stimulate increases in PpIX levels in LNCaP
prostate cancer cells (13). In other cells, however, this phenomenon did not appear entirely consistent. For example,
when vitamin D was added to cultures of skin keratinocytes,
no PpIX-elevating effect was observed in monolayer cell culture
(22). However, when the same cells were exposed to calcitriol in
a 3-dimensional (3D; organotypic) culture system, they
responded by accumulating significantly higher levels of PpIX
(22). The remarkable potency of calcitriol (in the picomolar
range) for stimulating PpIX accumulation in 3D cultures,
coupled with indications that such effects require a native
tissue environment, encouraged us to examine vitamin D
preconditioning in vivo.
In this article, we describe an investigation of the ability of
vitamin D to affect PpIX accumulation in fully formed epithelial tumors in vivo. Two different tumor models were used
to represent premalignant dysplasia and malignant carcinoma. We confirmed that vitamin D confers a tumor-specific
increase in photosensitizer (protoporphyrin) levels, and
showed the underlying mechanism, namely, a change in the
expression of 2 rate-limiting porphyrin-synthetic enzymes.
Furthermore, we showed that vitamin D preconditioning
selectively stimulates increased tumor cell killing after ALAPDT, relative to unconditioned controls. Finally, we explored
the mechanism of increased cell death and showed that
vitamin D encourages activation of the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway after ALA-PDT, accompanied by massive increases in
TNF-a production.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Vitamin D ointments Dovonex (calcipotriene, 0.005%) and
Vectical (calcitriol; 3 mg/g) were obtained from Warner Chilcott Inc., and Galderma Laboratories, respectively. Calcitriol
(1a,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D3) was obtained from SigmaAldrich.
Generation of tumor models in vivo
Superficial tumors in SKH-1 mice were generated by topical
application of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) and
12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) as described
previously (15). To generate deep s.c. tumors, immunocompromised nude mice (obtained from Charles River Laboratories) were injected with 2  106 A431 cells in the flanks, as
described previously (15). The A431 human squamous cell

www.aacrjournals.org

carcinoma cell line was purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection where the line was characterized by morphologic appearance during growth and recovery, cytochrome
C oxidase I PCR for species specificity, and human origin by
short tandem repeat (STR) profiling.
Preconditioning regimen using vitamin D
Superficial tumors were preconditioned with topical Vectical, Dovonex, or petrolatum (control) once daily for 3 days
followed by topical application of ALA (Levulan Kerastick;
DUSA Pharmaceuticals) for 4 hours on the fourth day.
Deep tumors were preconditioned via systemic vitamin D
in PBS (1 mg/kg) or PBS alone, delivered daily for 3 days by
intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. ALA was administered as described previously (15).
Analysis of PpIX fluorescence and histologic markers in
tumors
For analysis of PpIX levels, tumors were harvested, embedded for frozen sectioning, and analyzed on a Leica confocal
microscope as previously described (15). Standard hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was done on formalin-fixed/
paraffin-embedded tissues, and immunohistochemical staining was carried out as previously described (23). Sources and
dilutions of antibodies were as follows: active caspase-3
(BioVision; dilution 1:50), ferrochelatase (FC; 1:100), E-Cad
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100), Ki-67 (NeoMarkers; 1:250),
GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:100), TNF-a (BioXcell;
1:100), CY3, or fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated
Donkey anti-Rabbit (Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:1,500). To
assess cell proliferation in vivo, 5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine
(EdU) was injected (100 mg/mouse, i.p.) 1 hour before the
animals were sacrificed. Formalin-fixed tissues were sectioned
and incubated with the Click-iT reaction cocktail according to
the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). To estimate cell
death, the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay was conducted on
paraffin sections according to the manufacturer's (Roche
Applied Science) directions.
Light exposures for PDT in vivo
Tumors were irradiated at a fluence of 100 J/cm2 using a
633-nm noncoherent light source (LumaCare Products). The
source was calibrated using a FieldMate laser power meter
(Coherent).
Western blot analyses
Frozen tumors were powdered in a tissue pulverizer (Fisher
Scientific), dissolved in urea lysis buffer, and analyzed by the
Western blot technique, as described previously (15). Primary
antibodies were directed against ALA dehydratase [(ALAD)
Abnova; 1:1,000]; Active/Cleaved caspase-8 (Novus Biologicals;
1:5,000); Cleaved caspase-9 (Cell Signaling Technology;
1:1,000); caspase-12 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:1,000); FC
(a gift of Dr. Harry Dailey; 1:5,000); glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 1:5,000); porphobilinogen deaminase (Abnova; 1:1,000); TNF-a (BioXcell;
1:1,000); and a-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich; 1:10,000). Secondary

peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G
(IgG), donkey anti-goat IgG, or goat anti-rat IgG were used
(Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:20,000). Anti-CPO, a custommade antibody (15), was used at 1:5,000 dilution.
Measurements of serum vitamin D (calcitriol) levels
Serum levels of vitamin D were determined in SKH-1 mice
treated with systemic or topical calcitriol, or vehicle controls,
as described in Supplementary Table S1. Mice were sacrificed
by cardiac puncture. Serum was isolated from the blood after
coagulation and stored frozen at 80 C, and then shipped to
Heartland Assays Inc., on dry ice for determination of serum
calcitriol levels by radioimmunoassay.

Results
To test the hypothesis that vitamin D, delivered as a
preconditioning regimen, may enhance the production of
intracellular protoporphyrin and subsequent responses to
ALA-PDT, 2 in vivo epithelial tumor models were employed:
(i) superficial, low-grade squamous cell carcinomas (papillomas) generated by chemical carcinogenesis in hairless mice
(Fig. 1A), and (ii) a malignant carcinoma model in which
human squamous carcinoma cells (A431) were implanted s.c.
into immunocompromised nude mice (Fig. 1B).
Topical preconditioning of superficial tumors with
vitamin D analogues enhances the accumulation of
PpIX photosensitizer
Superficial skin tumors were pretreated topically with inert
vehicle (petrolatum), or with an ointment containing 1 of 2
different active vitamin D analogues (calcitriol or calcipotriene), daily for 3 days. The mice were then treated with
topical ALA for 4 hours, and tumors were harvested 4 days
after the initiation of vitamin D treatment. Frozen tumor
sections were examined by confocal microscopy under conditions that selectively excite the PpIX molecule and allow
detection of PpIX-specific fluorescence (Fig. 1C). This technique was shown previously to correlate closely with biochemical measurements of PpIX in cells and tissues (15). In
vitamin D–preconditioned tumors, PpIX was more abundant
(as documented by fluorescent intensity measurements averaged over the entire tumor; Fig. 1D) and was also qualitatively
present at greater depths within the tumor, as compared with
nonconditioned (control) tumors. This was true whether
calcitriol (Fig. 1C) or calcipotriene (Fig. 1D) was used. With
either of the vitamin D analogues, the 3-fold increase in PpIX
observed within tumors was statistically significant (Fig. 1D),
whereas no differential effect upon PpIX was observed in
normal skin (data not shown).
Systemically delivered vitamin D enhances PpIX
accumulation in deep squamous cell (A431) tumors
To examine effects of vitamin D in an invasive tumor model,
squamous carcinoma cells (A431) were implanted in nude
mice. Animals with visible tumors received systemic preconditioning with calcitriol or vehicle alone (saline) over a 3-day
period. On the fourth day, ALA was given intramuscularly, and

6042

24 hours later, tumors were harvested and analyzed for PpIX
levels (Fig. 1E). Calcitriol pretreatment caused a marked
increase in PpIX accumulation throughout the tumor
(Fig. 1E; compare top vs. bottom panels). A dose–response
study (Fig. 1F) revealed a significant increase in PpIX (4-fold)
at a dose of 0.1 mg/kg calcitriol, and PpIX levels reached
maximal levels (10-fold) at 0.5 mg/kg calcitriol and more
(Fig. 1F). Local (perilesional) injection of calcitriol into the
skin was also effective for delivery (Fig. 1F, bar 7). Interestingly,
intracutaneous injection of calcitriol at a site distant from
the tumor also exerted a PpIX-elevating effect, although less
pronounced (Fig. 1F, bar 8). Measurements of the serum
calcitriol concentration at 1 hour after injection or topical
application revealed calcitriol levels between 6 and 9 ng/mL;
residual levels at day 4 (after 3 preconditioning doses) were
indistinguishable from normal physiologic levels of calcitriol
(Supplementary Table S1).
Changes in porphyrin-synthetic enzyme expression
contribute to the increase in PpIX accumulation in
vitamin D–pretreated tumors
To explore the mechanism of increased PpIX accumulation
after calcitriol pretreatment, A431 tumor lysates from mice
preconditioned with calcitriol (1 mg/kg) or saline alone were
examined for changes in levels of the 4 porphyrin-synthetic
enzymes [ALAD, porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD), copropopyrinogen oxidase (CPO), and FC] that have been described
as potentially rate-limiting under various circumstances in
different biologic systems (24–29). Two enzymes were substantially altered after vitamin D pretreatment (Fig. 2A). CPO
was increased 5-fold, and FC was decreased 4-fold
(Fig. 2B). Each of these changes (higher CPO levels and lower
FC levels) favors an increase in accumulation of PpIX because
the enzymes lie immediately upstream and downstream of
PpIX, respectively.
Vitamin D pretreatment elicits preferential changes in
cellular differentiation and proliferation within tumors
in vivo
In our previous studies in various epithelial cancer cells in
vitro (12–14) and in vivo (15), we had shown that differentiation-promoting agents such as methotrexate cause an increase in PpIX accumulation that is tightly correlated with the
enhancement of terminal differentiation. Methotrexate always
caused growth arrest, but in the case of vitamin D, the effects
upon growth were less clear. For example, in an organotypic
keratinocyte model, calcitriol caused enhanced differentiation
while having no apparent effect upon proliferation (22).
To examine the effects of vitamin D upon epithelial tumors
in vivo, mice bearing superficial papillomas or deep A431
tumors were preconditioned with vitamin D by topical or
systemic delivery, respectively, and markers of cellular differentiation (E-cadherin) and proliferation (Ki-67) were examined histologically (Fig. 3). After vitamin D pretreatment, Ecadherin expression was increased 4- to 6-fold in both types of
tumors, as compared with an insignificant increase (<1.5-fold)
in normal skin (Fig. 3A). Vitamin D pretreatment also increased expression of the proliferative marker (Ki-67) in both

tumor types, as compared with no significant increase in
normal skin (Fig. 3B). To confirm that vitamin D stimulates
tumor cell proliferation in vivo, a second assay was conducted
in which EdU was injected into mice to measure incorporation
into newly synthesized DNA. The latter experiments confirmed that DNA synthesis is stimulated in tumors by pretreatment with vitamin D (Fig. 3C).
To determine which tumor cell populations express the
highest levels of PpIX following vitamin D pretreatment, colocalization experiments were carried out wherein adjacent
histologic sections were examined for PpIX (Supplementary
Fig. S1A), E-cadherin (Supplementary Fig. S1B), and Ki-67
expression (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The data show that
the highest levels of PpIX in the A431 tumors correspond
to differentiating areas, and these are almost completely
distinct from regions that express the proliferation marker,
Ki-67 (Supplementary Fig. S1A–C). The differentiating tumor
areas are also the sites of TNF-a production following light
exposure (Supplementary Fig. S1D), which is described in
more detail later in this article.
PDT-mediated cell death is enhanced in vitamin
D–preconditioned tumors
Tumors were preconditioned with calcitriol for 3 days,
treated with ALA and exposed to light, and then harvested
at various time points for analysis of cell death (Fig. 4). With
the use of the TUNEL assay on A431 tumors, a large increase
in cell killing was observed in vitamin D–pretreated tumors
(relative to vehicle alone) at 1, 6, and 24 hours, representing a
6-fold difference between the 2 conditions at all time points
(Fig. 4A and B). In the squamous cell papilloma model, a
similar preferential enhancement of cell death in vitamin D–
preconditioned tumors was observed (Fig. 4C). To better
examine the microanatomic extent of destruction, tumors
were also examined using H&E staining and scored by morphologic criteria, primarily the complete loss of cells (Fig. 4D;
Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Although evidence of cell
death was observable in control tumors by 6 hours of ALAPDT, significantly more areas of cell death were seen by 1 hour

6044

Cancer Res; 71(18) September 15, 2011

in vitamin D–preconditioned tumors, rising to a significantly
larger fraction of the total tumor area (250% larger) at 24
hours (Fig. 4E). Enhancement of cell killing occurred preferentially in vitamin D–preconditioned tumor tissue as compared with adjacent normal skin, indicating tumor selectivity
of the vitamin D effect (Supplementary Fig. S2C).
Enhancement of PDT-mediated cell death by vitamin D
involves cleavage of caspase-3 and caspase-8
Because positive TUNEL labeling indicates (but does not
prove) that an apoptotic pathway is activated after ALA-PDT,
histologic sections from papillomas (Fig. 5A) or A431 tumors
(Fig. 5B) were probed with an antibody specific for the
activated (cleaved) form of caspase-3. The results show that
caspase-3 is activated by ALA-PDT by 6 hours in both systems,
and vitamin D appears to cause a preferential increase in
caspase-3 activation. To learn which upstream proteolytic
pathway is responsible for caspase-3 activation (30), tumor
lysates were evaluated by Western blot analysis; no activation
of caspase-9 (Supplementary Fig. S3A; associated with the
mitochondrial pathway) (30), nor of caspase-12 (Supplementary Fig. S3B; associated with the endoplasmic reticulum
pathway; ref. 31) could be shown. In contrast, a plasma
membrane-associated caspase (caspase-8) was significantly
affected by vitamin D pretreatment (Fig. 5C). Expression of the
precursor form (Fig. 5D) and levels of the cleaved forms, p41
and p43 (Fig. 5E), were all increased significantly. Together,
these results indicate that caspase-8–mediated apoptosis
plays a major role in vitamin D enhancement of tumor cell
death after ALA-PDT.
The combination of vitamin D preconditioning and
ALA-PDT significantly increases production of TNF-a
within tumors in vivo
The fact that caspase-8 is preferentially cleaved in vitamin
D–preconditioned tumors after ALA-PDT (Fig. 5) suggests
that a membrane-associated death receptor, such as TNF
receptor (TNF-R), might be activated in this process. To test
this possibility, levels of TNF-a in calcitriol-preconditioned

TNF-a staining co-localized within tumor cells that also
expressed E-cadherin, that is, in the differentiated regions
of vitamin D–preconditioned tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S1D).

Discussion
Our data show that epithelial skin tumors in vivo, whether
premalignant or malignant, accumulate higher intracellular
levels of PpIX when preconditioned with vitamin D (calcitriol).
These PpIX increases occur preferentially in neoplastic versus
normal tissues. The underlying biochemical basis for these
observations is an altered expression of 2 enzymes in the
porphyrin synthesis pathway after vitamin D preconditioning.

CPO is increased whereas FC is decreased; the net effect is a
greater accumulation of PpIX. As a consequence, vitamin
D–preconditioned tumors show an enhanced cytotoxic response to ALA-PDT.
Our data suggest that, in addition to a selective increase in
PpIX, other mechanisms contribute to vitamin D–mediated
enhancement of tumor killing. In the vitamin D–pretreated
tumors prior to ALA-PDT, a small (2-fold) increase in TNF-a
can be detected. However, following exposure to ALA-PDT,
TNF-a levels become preferentially elevated in the vitamin D–
preconditioned tumors (70-fold above baseline), mostly
within the differentiated tumor cells but also within vascular
structures, compared with unconditioned tumors (10-fold
above baseline). Notably, expression of TNF-a within blood
vessels and endothelial cells in inflamed tissues has been
reported previously (32, 33). High TNF-a levels are often

associated with activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway,
in which pro-caspase-8 cleavage occurs after ligation of death
receptors such as TNF-R and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL-R1) on the plasma membrane of cells (34, 35).
The extrinsic pathway is involved after PDT, on the basis that
caspase-8 and caspase-3 are preferentially activated, whereas
caspase-9 and caspase-12 are not. In the few studies in the
literature that examined mechanisms of cell death following
aminolevulinate-based PDT, caspase activation in leukemia
and lymphoma cells was either undetectable (36) or involved
caspase-9 (37). However, human oral (epithelial) cancer cells
showed activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-9 after PDT
using 5-ALA (38). The latter report is consistent with our
observation of ALA-PDT–mediated activation of caspase-8 in
vitamin D–pretreated A431 epithelial tumors in vivo.
Although the ability of vitamin D to elevate PpIX levels in
cultured cells was described previously (13, 22, 39), our new
data are significant because they establish a tumor-selective
PpIX-inducing effect of vitamin D in vivo. The magnitude of
PpIX enhancement achievable in tumors in vivo equals or
exceeds the effects obtainable in vitro—an observation that
may indicate a role for paracrine signaling between epithelial
and stromal cells. The 3- to 10-fold rise in PpIX accumulation

www.aacrjournals.org

in benign papillomas and A431 s.c. tumors compares very
favorably to calcitriol-induced elevations in PpIX reported
previously in cultured cell lines. For example, PpIX was
elevated 1.5-fold in cultured A431 cell monolayers (39), 2.3fold in organotypic rat epidermal keratinocytes (REK; ref. 22),
and 10-fold in LNCaP prostate carcinoma cells (13), when
those cultures were preincubated with calcitriol (pmol/L to
nmol/L concentration range, 24- to 96-hour incubation) followed by ALA or hexyl-ALA.
The finding that vitamin D leads to activation of the
extrinsic pathway and increased TNF-a production is particularly compelling because the literature suggests a beneficial
link between high TNF-a levels and increased PDT efficacy.
Bellnier showed that, for s.c. implanted adenocarcinomas,
injection of a single dose of recombinant TNF-a 3 hours
before PDT (using Photofrin, from Axcan Pharma, as the
photosensitizer) led to an improved tumor response, with
no deleterious effects upon normal skin photosensitization
(40). The same group showed that preadministration of 5,6dimethylxanthenone-4 acetic acid (DMXAA), a drug that
elevates TNF-a levels, causes significant enhancement in
tumor responsiveness to Photofrin-mediated PDT in mice
with s.c. RIF-1 fibrosarcomas (41). Furthermore, DMXAA

displayed a similar PDT-enhancing effect using a different
tumor model (colon carcinoma cells) and photosensitizer
(Photochlor; HPPH; ref. 42). Although the photosensitizer
used in those studies was not 5-ALA, the results suggest that
any agent capable of increasing intratumoral TNF-a levels at
the time PDT is administered might help to increase overall
cell killing. Preconditioning with vitamin D represents a novel
way to achieve this end.
Vitamin D now joins methotrexate in a growing arsenal of
agents that effectively promote PpIX accumulation. However,
methotrexate stimulates tumor cell differentiation and inhibits proliferation (15), whereas vitamin D appears to stimulate
both differentiation and proliferation (Fig. 3; Supplementary
Fig. S1). This brings up 2 important questions: (i) what is the
cellular basis for vitamin D–stimulated proliferation in these
areas, and (ii) what are the possible consequences for the
therapeutic response to PDT? The fact that vitamin D causes
increased proliferation in the normal epidermis of mice
(Fig. 3C) is actually a well-reported phenomenon (43, 44)
for which the molecular basis remains controversial. A common misconception is that vitamin D always causes epithelial
growth arrest, but Gniadecki and colleagues showed that, in
human keratinocytes, exposure to calcitriol (at pmol/L or
nmol/L concentrations) can cause either growth arrest or
hyperproliferation, based on whether cells are undifferentiated or committed to terminal differentiation (45). In breast
cancer cell lines (46), calcitriol stimulated cell growth at low
concentrations (0.1 nmol/L). In that situation, the balance

6048

Cancer Res; 71(18) September 15, 2011

between proliferation and growth arrest appeared to depend
upon levels of a pro-proliferative molecule (a degradation
product of calcitriol) that accumulates through the action
of an oxidative enzyme, CYP24 (46). Taking everything discussed above into account, the observation that some regions
of epithelial tumors in vivo exhibit a pro-proliferative response
to calcitriol whereas other regions exhibit a differentiation
response appears to make sense.
The more pressing question, of course, is how the differentiated versus proliferative regions of vitamin D–pretreated
tumors respond to ALA-PDT, and whether the regions with
low PpIX could be a problem if surviving cells were to continue
to proliferate after treatment. Our data showed a robust cell
kill in the central zone of nodular tumors (Supplementary
Fig. S2) that was consistent with a combined effect of ALAPDT and hypoxia in these regions. However, the surviving rim
of cells observed at the tumor periphery is a reminder that this
report is only an initial description of vitamin D and ALA-PDT;
no judgment about preclinical efficacy can be made until
detailed animal studies are conducted using higher fluences of
light, multiple PDT treatments, and longer-term analyses of
tumor regression and regrowth. The literature, however, offers
indications that hyperproliferation in response to vitamin D
could represent an advantage rather than a disadvantage.
Tumor cells may become more susceptible to PDT when
forced to actively proliferate; this was shown in studies (with
either hematoporphyrin or PpIX) examining relationships
between cell-cycle stage and PDT-responsiveness, which

Calcitriol and Photodynamic Therapy of Squamous Carcinoma

showed that cells are usually most sensitive in S-phase, that is,
while undergoing active DNA synthesis (47–49). Furthermore,
as suggested by Gniadecki and colleagues (45), epithelial
cells with a hyperproliferative response to vitamin D may
actually represent a population already committed to terminal
differentiation, thereby having a relatively low growth potential. A final point is that TNF-a released within vitamin
D–preconditioned tumors may produce a bystander effect,
promoting apoptosis in cells that manage to escape direct
photocytotoxicity.
Thinking ahead to the clinic, it will be important to address
the advantages and disadvantages of vitamin D preconditioning compared with preconditioning with methotrexate, another clinically used drug that has shown efficacy in increasing
levels of ALA-induced PpIX (15). The potential for undesirable
side effects, such as liver toxicity (with methotrexate) and
hypercalcemia (with vitamin D), may be relatively small due to
the short duration and low doses used to achieve transient
PpIX-enhancement before PDT. However, only clinical trials
can establish this for sure. In a pilot study to address the
question of hypercalcemia in mice, peak and trough serum
levels of calcitriol were measured (Supplementary Table S1)
and compared with values from the literature (50). Calcitriol
serum levels were measured 1 hour after the following
conditions: (i) injection of a 1-mg/kg dose; (ii) injection of
an 8-mg/kg dose, replicating the study of Muindi and colleagues (50); and (iii) a single application of calcitriol ointment. We found that peak levels were similar for all conditions
(6–9 ng/mL), within the range reported by Muindi and
colleagues (50). No evidence for a residual calcitriol elevation

was found, that is, the serum trough levels after 3 days of
preconditioning were indistinguishable from physiologic
background levels in mice (50). This suggests a reasonable
safety margin, given that Muindi and colleagues (50) employed
calcitriol doses at least 8 times higher than those used in our
study, and the doses used were sufficient to exert antitumor
effects without any detectable side effects in mice (50).
In humans, whether or not calcitriol can offer a safe and
effective adjuvant approach for PDT remains an open question. Alternatively, could one use another form of vitamin D,
such as 25-OH vitamin D3 (calcidiol, the major isoform of
vitamin D found in health food supplements) that requires
subsequent conversion to calcitriol? These will be interesting
questions for future studies.
