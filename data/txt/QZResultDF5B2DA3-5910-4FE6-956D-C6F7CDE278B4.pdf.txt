Abstract
Kinases are dysregulated in most cancers, but the frequency of speciﬁc kinase mutations is low, indicating a
complex etiology in kinase dysregulation. Here, we report a strategy to rapidly identify functionally important
kinase targets, irrespective of the etiology of kinase pathway dysregulation, ultimately enabling a correlation of
patient genetic proﬁles to clinically effective kinase inhibitors. Our methodology assessed the sensitivity of primary
leukemia patient samples to a panel of 66 small-molecule kinase inhibitors over 3 days. Screening of 151 leukemia
patient samples revealed a wide diversity of drug sensitivities, with 70% of the clinical specimens exhibiting
hypersensitivity to one or more drugs. From this data set, we developed an algorithm to predict kinase pathway
dependence based on analysis of inhibitor sensitivity patterns. Applying this algorithm correctly identiﬁed
pathway dependence in proof-of-principle specimens with known oncogenes, including a rare FLT3 mutation
outside regions covered by standard molecular diagnostic tests. Interrogation of all 151 patient specimens with
this algorithm identiﬁed a diversity of kinase targets and signaling pathways that could aid prioritization of
deep sequencing data sets, permitting a cumulative analysis to understand kinase pathway dependence within
leukemia subsets. In a proof-of-principle case, we showed that in vitro drug sensitivity could predict both a clinical
response and the development of drug resistance. Taken together, our results suggested that drug target scores
derived from a comprehensive kinase inhibitor panel could predict pathway dependence in cancer cells while
simultaneously identifying potential therapeutic options. Cancer Res; 73(1); 285–96. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Gene-targeted cancer therapies have achieved remarkable
clinical outcomes in recent years (1–4). In particular, cellpermeable small molecules that exhibit inhibitory activity
against tyrosine kinases have generated great interest. Tyrosine kinases represent a gene family widely implicated in

cancer pathogenesis (5, 6), and dysregulation of speciﬁc tyrosine kinases has been observed in most hematologic malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML; ref. 7),
chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML; refs. 8–11), other
myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN; refs. 12–15), acute myeloid leukemia (AML; refs. 9, 16–20), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; refs. 21–26), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(CLL; refs. 27–30). Although a minority of patients with hematologic malignancies are successfully treated with kinase inhibitors, most patients remain ineligible for this form of targeted
therapy due to lack of knowledge of the speciﬁc kinase pathways involved.
Many strategies exist to better understand kinase dysregulation in cancer including the recent development of deep
sequencing techniques, which are accelerating our understanding of cancer genetics. Thus far, however, many studies
of malignancies with predicted kinase pathway dependence
have not found frequent mutations in kinase genes (31–34).
These ﬁndings suggest that kinase pathway dependence in
malignant cells often occurs due to complex genetic mechanisms. Hence, although deep sequencing represents an
immensely powerful technique, it may not independently allow
for prediction of kinase targets and kinase inhibitor therapies.
Instead, understanding of the best kinase inhibitor therapies
for patients will likely require the combination of deep
sequencing with complementary studies that can deﬁne kinase

targets regardless of mutational status. These functionally
important kinase pathways can then be correlated with genetic
proﬁles that have been revealed by deep sequencing.
To better deﬁne the use of kinase inhibitor therapies in
hematologic malignancies, we have developed a small-molecule kinase inhibitor panel designed to identify kinase pathway
dependence in primary leukemia samples. To analyze kinase
pathway dependence based on this functional data, we have
developed an accompanying bioinformatics approach to predict the kinase targets underlying inhibitor sensitivity proﬁles.
This algorithm takes advantage of our knowledge of the gene
products that are targeted by each drug as well as the fact that
these target proﬁles are partially overlapping. Using the overlap of effective drugs and eliminating targets of ineffective
drugs, we are able to predict critical kinase targets and
signaling pathways for individual patient samples. These
kinase target predictions represent a manner by which functional data from drug screening could be integrated with
genomics data such as deep sequencing to aid in prioritization
of sequence variants and, thus, accelerate our understanding of
molecular etiologies of cancer as well as application of individualized therapeutic approaches for patients.

Materials and Methods
Kinase inhibitors
Kinase inhibitors were purchased from or were generously
provided by the sources outlined in Supplementary Table S7.
Collection of patient samples and cell culture
All clinical samples were obtained with informed consent
with approval by the Institutional Review Boards of Stanford
University (Stanford, CA), Oregon Health & Science University
(Portland, OR), the Children's Oncology Group, and Erasmus
Medical Center/Sophia Children's Hospital (Rotterdom, the
Netherlands). Blood or bone marrow from patients was separated on a Ficoll gradient and mononuclear cells were treated with ammonium-chloride-potassium (ACK) lysis buffer.
The only exceptions to this procedure were cases of atypical
CML or chronic neutrophilic leukemia, where samples were
only processed with ACK lysis buffer to preserve the neoplastic
granulocytes that would otherwise be lost on the Ficoll
gradient. Cells from myeloid leukemia samples were cultured
in R10 [RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS
(Atlanta Biologicals), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen), and fungizone (Invitrogen)] supplemented with
104 M 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma). Cells from lymphoid
leukemia samples were cultured in R20 [RPMI-1640 medium
supplemented with 20% FBS (Atlanta Biologicals), L-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen), and fungizone
(Invitrogen)] supplemented with 104 M 2-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma) insulin-transferrin-sodium selenite (Invitrogen).
Kinase inhibitor screen
Kinase inhibitors were stored at 10 to 100 mmol/L in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; stock concentration was 1,000
times the ﬁnal concentration of the highest tested dose). Drugs
were used at ﬁnal concentrations shown in Supplementary
Table S4. For creation of replicate plates of the library, each

286

Cancer Res; 73(1) January 1, 2013

drug concentration was diluted to twice the ﬁnal concentration and 50 mL were plated into 96-well plates using a Hydra 96channel automated pipettor (Matrix Technologies). Plates were
sealed with adhesive lids (Bio-Rad; microplate seal B), wrapped
in aluminum foil, and stored at 20 C until use. Upon receipt of
a patient sample, plates were thawed at 37 C, 5% CO2 for 1 hour
and centrifuged at 800  g before removal of adhesive lids.
Subsequently, patient samples were suspended into culture
media at a concentration of 1,000,000 cells per mL, such that
addition of 50 mL to each well would deliver 50,000 cells to that
well (this also dilutes the drugs to their ﬁnal, desired concentration). Cells were incubated for 3 days at 37 C, 5% CO2 and
subjected to a CellTiter 96 AQueous One solution cell proliferation assay (Promega). Each plate contained 7 wells without
any drug. The average absorbance value of these 7 wells was
used for data normalization and the kill curve of each drug
gradient was assessed relative to this average no-drug point.
Quantiﬁcation of patient response and effective drug
targets
An algorithm was designed and implemented using Excel
and Visual Basic to provide automated IC50 calculation and
therapeutic target identiﬁcation. IC50 values were calculated
using second-degree polynomial regression curves ﬁt through
5 data points (average of no drug wells and 4 serial dilution
points). All curves were manually inspected and a small
number of IC50s were corrected in 2 circumstances: (1) The
curve ﬁt intersected the IC50 at 2 distinct points —the lower
concentration intersect was used in these instances; (2) the
polynomial curve ﬁt yielded an artiﬁcial IC50 not reﬂected in
the data points (generally due to increasing cell viability over
the course of the drug titration). For a given sample, drug IC50
values were considered effective if they were less than or equal
to 5-fold below the median IC50 for all samples tested. Where an
IC50 was not achieved for a given drug, an IC50 value equal to
the highest drug concentration used was arbitrarily assigned.
After effective and ineffective drugs were determined for each
sample, a drug target score was assigned by the program for
each potential therapeutic target.
The drug target score is based on the IC50 measured effectiveness of panel drugs against a given therapeutic target for a
given patient. Each drug is associated with a "tiered" ranking of
target kinases for which the drug has been shown to biochemically associate (35, 37–43). Weights are used to give a stronger
quantitative emphasis to targets with a higher ranking (Figs. 4A
and 4C). Scores are determined empirically for a given sample
by assigning positive weighted scores to targets of effective
drugs and negative weighted scores to targets of ineffective
drugs. Drug effectiveness threshold and tiered ranking weights
were determined empirically using patient samples and cell
lines with known kinase signaling abnormalities. The algorithm generates a cumulative drug target score for each target
according to the following equations:
n

Effective drug target score ¼
WeightTier ðiÞ
i¼1

Where WeightTier (i) is a given drug target's tier ranking for
drug i and n is the number of effective drugs.

Results
Development of a kinase inhibitor panel for analysis of
primary leukemia specimens
The ubiquitous role of tyrosine kinases in regulating critical
cellular processes leading to malignancy suggests that a large
percentage of leukemia (and other malignancy) patient samples would exhibit sensitivity to inhibition of one or more
kinase pathways. To test this hypothesis, we compiled a library
of 66 small-molecule kinase inhibitors with collective activity
against two-thirds of the tyrosine kinome (Supplementary
Table S1). Because many nontyrosine kinases are also critical
regulators of cellular growth/survival, we also included drugs
with activity against select families of nontyrosine kinases
including phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT, PKC, PKA,
IkK, RAF/MEK/ERK, c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK), p38, AMPK,
aurora kinases, and cyclin-dependent kinases (Supplementary
Table S1). Each inhibitor was plated at 4 graded concentrations
that bracket the predicted on-target IC50 value. Primary patient
samples were incubated with this panel of drugs for 3 days at
which point a tetrazolium-based cell viability assay (MTS) was
conducted for assessment of cell viability. All values were
normalized to cells incubated in the absence of drug (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Analysis of 151 leukemia patient samples with smallmolecule kinase inhibitor panel
Over a 2-year period, we accrued and tested 151 fresh,
primary leukemia patient samples against this panel of kinase
inhibitors. The cohort was comprised of 34 AML, 42 ALL, 31
MPN, and 44 CLL patients. Detailed clinical and demographic
information about this patient cohort can be found in Supplementary Table S2. Assessment of kinase inhibitor hypersensitivity proﬁles of these 151 leukemia patient samples
revealed a wide diversity of responses to kinase inhibitors,
even when patients were grouped according to diagnostic
subsets and kinase inhibitors grouped according to predicted
kinase target spectra (Fig. 1). Despite this heterogeneity of
responses, certain trends emerged, such as more frequent
sensitivity to PI3K/AKT inhibitors in lymphoid samples. In
addition, select cases could be identiﬁed with universal sensitivity to whole families of kinase inhibitors. For example,
AML case 07335 exhibited universal sensitivity to all ERBB

www.aacrjournals.org

family inhibitors on the panel, suggesting involvement of an
ERBB family member in maintenance of the viability of malignant cells from that patient (Fig. 1). Overall, 70% of patients
exhibited hypersensitivity to one or more kinase inhibitors
(IC50 data for each drug for each patient specimen listed in
Supplementary Table S3; raw data points used to generate
these IC50s listed in Supplementary Table S4). Nine of the drugs
on our panel are currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA; imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib, sunitinib,
erlotinib, geﬁtinib, lapatinib, sorafenib, and pazopanib), and
approximately 40% of samples exhibit hypersensitivity to one
or more of these 9 drugs. Hypersensitivity to a drug was
determined by comparison of the response of each individual
sample with the response of all other samples (patient IC50
compared with whole cohort median IC50). In this way, we
could deﬁne outlier samples that were truly hypersensitive to a
given drug versus responses at higher concentrations that
might occur due to off-target toxicity of the compound. Rank
ordering of patient IC50s for each drug helps illustrate this
point (Supplementary Fig. S2). To better distinguish inhibitor
sensitivity proﬁles that were similar from patient to patient, we
applied one-way Pearson correlation for hierarchical clustering of the data (Supplementary Fig. S3). Notably, although drug
responses are clearly not uniform among diagnostic subsets,
there were large groups of patients diagnosed with the same
type of leukemia [notably ALL (shaded red) and CLL (shaded
yellow); Supplementary Fig. S3] with similar responses to these
kinase inhibitors. However, the segregation of sample
responses by cell type was far from complete with a number
of isolated lymphoid samples clustering amidst myeloid cases
and vice versa. In addition, 2-way hierarchical clustering
revealed drugs with similar activity proﬁles across patients
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Many of these drugs clustered in
groups that would be predicted on the basis of known target
proﬁles of the compounds such as BIRB-796 and VX-745 (both
p38 inhibitors), ﬂavopiridol and BMS-387032 (both CDK inhibitors), and EKB-569 and CI-1033 (both ERBB-family
inhibitors).

Logical prediction of oncogenic signaling pathways
using inhibitor sensitivity proﬁles
Clinical and research interest in the application of kinase
inhibitors has led to a concerted effort to develop techniques
that characterize the targets to which each compound can
effectively bind (35–38). Because a majority of the kinase
inhibitors on our panel have been characterized in this manner, we realized that this information could be used to predict
the critical kinase targets and signaling pathways that underlie
the observed kinase inhibitor sensitivity patterns. Development of this bioinformatics approach relies on the fact that all
kinase inhibitors on our panel bind multiple targets and the
target spectra for these drugs are partially overlapping. Thus, if
a sample exhibits sensitivity to 2 different drugs, the kinase
targets that are commonly inhibited by both drugs are implicated as most likely to explain this sensitivity pattern (unless
there are 2 different pathways operational in that sample).
A second step can further narrow the candidate kinase list

by elimination of targets of drugs to which a sample is not
sensitive.
The results from AML patient 08024 illustrate our target
identiﬁcation strategy. Malignant cells from this patient were
hypersensitive to 3 drugs: AST-487, sunitinib, and SU-14813. As
noted above, drug hypersensitivity is deﬁned by comparison of
the IC50 values for this individual sample with the median IC50
values that these drugs achieved across the entire cohort. Cells
from patient 08024 exhibited IC50 values that were at least
5-fold lower than the cohort median IC50 values for each of
these 3 drugs (Fig. 2A). Analysis of the known targets of these
3 compounds revealed 4 kinases, KIT, PDGFR, CSF1R, and
FLT3, that are common targets between all 3 drugs (Fig. 2B).
Because this sample was also unaffected by the 2 drugs,
dasatinib and nilotinib (no difference between patient 08024
IC50 and median IC50; Fig. 2A), the kinase targets of these 2

288

drugs can be eliminated from consideration as kinases that
could mechanistically explain cell viability in this patient
sample. The kinase targets that are effectively inhibited by
dasatinib and/or nilotinib are shaded blue, whereas the
kinases not targeted by either dasatinib or nilotinib are
shaded red (Fig. 2B). This reveals that the only kinase target
in common between AST-487, sunitinib, and SU-14813 that is
also not a target of dasatinib or nilotinib is FLT3. Further
analysis of AML patient 08024 revealed presence of the FLT3ITD and no wild-type FLT3 alleles (Fig. 2C).

Drug Screen to Identify Leukemia Pathway Dependence

Figure 2. Logical prediction of kinase targets based on drug sensitivity/resistance. To predict operational kinase targets in Patient 08024, response to 5 kinase
inhibitors was considered. A, patient 08024 exhibited at least 5-fold lower IC50 than median to AST-487, SU-14813, and sunitinib (effective drugs),
whereas no difference is seen between median and patient 08024 IC50s for dasatinib and nilotinib (ineffective drugs). To predict targets that underlie this
sensitivity pattern, the overlap of kinase targets between the 3 effective drugs (AST-487, SU-14813, and sunitinib) is shown in B revealing that only KIT,
PDGFR, CSF1R, and FLT3 are common kinase targets between these drugs. To distinguish between these 4 targets, their responsiveness to the ineffective
drugs (dasatinib and nilotinib) was considered. The kinase targets in blue (KIT, PDGFR, CSF1R) are good targets of dasatinib and/or nilotinib, whereas
the kinase targets in red (FLT3) were not effectively inhibited by dasatinib or nilotinib. Elimination of these dasatinib/nilotinib targets (in blue) leaves only FLT3
as a potential kinase target for explanation of the functional response to these 5 drugs. Follow-up PCR analysis revealed this AML patient sample to exhibit

entire panel of 66 drugs requires computational support. We
have developed an algorithm to carry out the same logical steps
outlined in Fig. 2, for all 66 kinase inhibitors in 4 steps (Sweave
document with instructions for generating application to
perform this algorithm can be found in Supplementary Material). First, the kinase target information for each drug was
curated from published sources (35, 37–43) into a database
(Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 1). Second, the Kd or IC50
values (depending on the format of assay used to deﬁne drug
targets) for each drug were subdivided into 5 tiers on a Log10
scale. The ﬁrst tier is deﬁned as the kinase with the lowest Kd
or IC50 value as well as all other kinases with Kd or IC50 values
less than or equal to 10-fold than lowest value. Kinases with
Kd or IC50 values ranging from 10-fold to 100-fold, the lowest
values are considered tier 2 targets. Each subsequent Log10
increase in Kd or IC50 comprises a new tier of kinase targets
(Fig. 3A; bottom). Next, the IC50 results from an individual
patient sample are subdivided into drugs to which the sample
was hypersensitive (deﬁned by a patient-speciﬁc IC50 that is 5fold less than the cohort median IC50) as well as the drugs to
which the sample is not sensitive (Fig. 3B). We next devised a
scoring system that assigns points to each kinase based on

www.aacrjournals.org

whether inhibitors deﬁned to block that kinase target were
effective (positive points awarded to the target's score) or
ineffective (negative points deducted from the target's score).
The addition or subtraction of points is conducted in a graded
manner with tier 1 kinases having the most points added or
subtracted from their score and the score for kinases from
each subsequent tier being modiﬁed to lesser degrees (Fig.
3C). Finally, the cumulative scores for each kinase are tabulated and ranked such that the highest scoring kinases for any
given patient are those kinases predicted to be most probable
in explaining the observed drug response and, therefore, the
most probable in playing a pathogenic role for that patient's
malignancy (Fig. 3D).

To test this algorithm, we chose 3 specimens from patients
with leukemia with known, dysregulated tyrosine kinase pathways and one specimen from a patient without a known kinase
mutation. The ﬁrst example, AML patient 08024, was described

small-molecule kinase inhibitors. To determine whether our
algorithm would also successfully identify FLT3 as a high
probability target when applying data from all 66 drugs, we
conducted the algorithm on kinase inhibitor panel screening
outcomes from this patient sample. This exercise revealed that
FLT3 was the second highest scoring kinase on the target list
with a score of 89 points (Fig. 4A). The highest scoring kinase
(EGFR) scored 90 points due to near complete hypersensitivity
of this specimen to ERBB family inhibitors. Analysis of target
proﬁles of these ERBB family inhibitors reveals that they do not
exhibit off-target effects against FLT3 (37), indicating that
there may be cross-talk between the FLT3-ITD oncogene and
ERBB family members. We also applied this screen to cells from
a patient with CML in blast crisis. In this case, the algorithm
correctly identiﬁed ABL1 as the top-scoring kinase (Fig. 4B).
Finally, we applied this technique to cells from a patient with
MPN positive for the oncogene, MPL-W515L. In this case, 3 of

290

the top 5 targets are JAK family kinases, which represent
therapeutic targets downstream of MPL (MPL is not a kinase,
but signals through JAK kinases; refs. 44, 45; Fig. 4C). Thus,
application of this algorithm to 3 proof-of-principle examples
shows that the approach correctly identiﬁes known oncogenic
signaling pathways in each case. In addition, a patient with
AML (08102) with no known mutations in tyrosine kinases
exhibited hypersensitivity to 12 of the kinase inhibitors on our
panel (Fig. 4D). Among the kinases predicted by our algorithm
to be likely involved in pathogenesis of this specimen was FLT3,
which is commonly mutated in AML (Fig. 4E). However, as
noted above, this patient did not exhibit any of the common
FLT3 abnormalities. This prompted us to conduct more extensive sequencing of FLT3, and we identiﬁed a point mutation in
the extracellular region of FLT3 (S451F; Fig. 4F), this rare
mutation has been previously shown to exhibit transformative
capacity (46).

Drug Screen to Identify Leukemia Pathway Dependence

Figure 4. Algorithm kinase target scores for 4 leukemia patient samples with known oncogenic lesions. Proof-of-principle of performance of algorithm
described in Fig. 3. The algorithm kinase target scores from 3 patient samples with known genetic etiology are considered. The ﬁrst sample (A) is an AML
patient with FLT3-ITD, and FLT3 ranks as the second highest kinase target. EGFR is the highest scoring kinase in this example due to complete
hypersensitivity of the specimen to ERBB family inhibitors. This may reveal a mechanistic link between FLT3 and ERBB family signaling, as the ERBB family
inhibitors do not exhibit afﬁnity for FLT3. The second sample (B) is derived from a patient with CML in blast crisis with no kinase domain mutations in BCR-ABL.
ABL1 is the top scoring kinase for this sample. The third example (C) is an MPN patient with an MPL-W515L mutation. Although MPL is not a kinase (and
is not scored by the algorithm), it signals primarily through JAK kinases. Notably, JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are 3 of the top 5 scoring kinases for this example. A
fourth patient with no known kinase mutations exhibited sensitivity to a variety of kinase inhibitors on our panel (D). The algorithm described in Fig. 3 predicted
this pattern to be driven by dependence on a variety of type III receptor tyrosine kinases, including FLT3, which is commonly mutated in AML (E). Because
this patient did not exhibit any of the FLT3 mutations commonly observed in AML, we sequenced full-length FLT3 and identiﬁed a rare point mutation in the
FLT3 extracellular domain (S451F), previously shown to exhibit transformative capacity. The sequence trace of this mutant FLT3 allele is shown in F.

The data reveal a heterogeneous list of probable kinase targets

Figure 5. Cumulative algorithm kinase target scores by diagnosis. To gain insight into targets that are frequently and infrequently predicted in various
diagnostic subsets of leukemia, we tabulated cumulative kinase target scores for ALL, AML, CLL, CML, CMML, and other MPN. Target scores for
all 151 patients were tabulated by the algorithm described in Fig. 4 (individual patient target scores can be found in Supplementary Table S5). To compute
cumulative scores, all negative values were eliminated and remaining positive values were normalized for each patient to that patient's respective highest
scoring kinase, such that all scores were on the same scale from 0 to 1 for every patient. The mean of these normalized scores for each kinase was
then calculated for every patient within the above diagnostic leukemia subsets. These average target scores for each leukemia subset were once again
normalized to the highest scoring respective gene from within each leukemia subset such that each subset was represented on the same 0 to 1 scale. These
values are illustrated on a heatmap where darkest blue indicates targets most frequently predicted to be operationally important within each respective
leukemia subset and white indicating no evidence for functional importance. Notably, as a proof-of-principle, ABL1 is the highest cumulative scoring kinase in
CML. The numerical input for this heatmap is found in Supplementary Table S6.

therapies. However, the data can also be used to identify kinases
that may be more frequently implicated in any one diagnostic
subset of malignancy. As such, we tabulated the average kinase
scores for each patient within the broad diagnostic categories
of ALL, CLL, AML, CML, CMML, and other MPN. Kinase scores
were normalized for comparison between patients by dividing
all scores of a given proﬁle by the maximum score for that proﬁle.
Negative scores were removed resulting in a normalized proﬁle
score between 0 and 1. Next, we computed average normalized
scores for each kinase across diagnostic groups. Finally, the
kinase scores for each diagnostic group were again normalized
to the highest scoring kinase within each group so that each
diagnostic category would be represented on the same scale.
These values were then expressed on a heatmap to visually

represent the kinases that are predicted to be more frequently
involved in the pathogenesis of each of these broad diagnostic
subsets of hematologic malignancies (Fig. 5; input data found in
Supplementary Table S6). As anticipated, ABL1 is the highest
cumulative scoring kinase among CML patients tested, serving
as a proof-of-principle for this strategy. Interestingly, CaM
kinases seem to score highly in lymphoid but not myeloid
malignancies. One possible link between that CaM kinases and
lymphoid malignancies may be the activation of CBP. Recent
studies have identiﬁed mutations in CBP (and loss of activity) as
a strong correlation with relapse in ALL (47). It has been
previously established that phosphorylation of CBP by CaM
kinase IV is important for its activity (48). Therefore, inhibition of
CaM kinases may provide further insight to the functional

Drug Screen to Identify Leukemia Pathway Dependence

Figure 6. Correlation of in vitro sensitivity with clinical patient response. A, a specimen from a multiple-relapsed AML patient was evaluated on the kinase
inhibitor panel and exhibited hypersensitivity to a variety of kinase inhibitors, including 2 that are FDA-approved (sorafenib and sunitinib). B, this patient
was treated on sorafenib and subsequently treated on sunitinib and responded well to both treatments with rapid reductions in WBC counts, peripheral
blast percentage, and bone marrow blast percentage. C, in vitro response of this patient's cells to sorafenib mimicked the clinical response whereby
pretreatment cells were highly sensitive and cells taken after sorafenib relapse exhibited an IC50 greater than logs higher than the pretreatment cells. D in vitro
response of this patient's cells to sunitinib was consistent with the clinical response whereby cells were highly sensitive to sunitinib before sorafenib treatment
and at sorafenib relapse, at which time the patient responded beneﬁcially to treatment with sunitinib.

importance of CBP in lymphoid viability. PI3K and AKT isoforms score highly in lymphoid malignancies as well as MPN,
but are infrequently represented in patients with AML. BTK
scores highly in patients with CLL, consistent with the notion
that B-cell receptor signaling, which depends partly on BTK, is
critical for viability of cells from many patients with CLL
(28, 30). Cyclin-dependent kinases are predicted to be involved
more frequently in MPN than in AML or lymphoid malignancies. Ephrin receptors score strongly across all diagnostic
groups. In addition, p38 appears frequently involved in all
malignancy subsets, and especially so in AML and CMML.
There are a wide diversity of genes and signaling pathways
that are predicted to play a role in the pathogenesis of each type
of hematologic malignancy. However, our drug target scoring
algorithm indicates particular pathways are more frequently
represented in some diagnostic subsets than in others. Followup investigation will be required to validate the complete
genetic etiology of these observations.
Clinical relevance of in vitro drug sensitivity/resistance
The clinical use of this type of test is predicated on a
meaningful correlation between in vitro and an in vivo response
to kinase inhibitors. As a proof-of-concept, we tested this
correlation in a patient with refractory AML. A 36 year-old

www.aacrjournals.org

patient with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 133,000 was
diagnosed with AML with inversion of chromosome 2 and
trisomy 8. The FLT3-ITD was noted to be weakly positive with
an allelic ratio of 0.02. Following leukapheresis and a standard
7þ3 induction therapy, he was found to have refractory AML
and was reinduced with HAM chemotherapy. Although he
achieved a remission and soon after underwent an unrelated
donor transplant, he relapsed 60 days later. The donor was not
available for donor leukocyte infusions and the patient was
refractory to FLAG-IDA salvage therapy. Our inhibitor panel
showed dramatic sensitivity to numerous kinase inhibitors,
including several drugs that are already FDA-approved and have
been used for treatment of AML (Fig. 6A). Because this patient
had no other standard therapeutic options, he elected treatment
with one of the inhibitors predicted to be effective by the
inhibitor panel assay. Daily treatment with this drug, sorafenib,
induced a rapid normalization of WBC counts with decreased
blasts in both the peripheral blood and bone marrow that was
maintained for more than 2 months (Fig. 6B). At the time of
relapse, a repeat kinase inhibitor sensitivity panel showed that
the in vitro response to sorafenib was approximately 3 logs less
than the pretreatment cells (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, the analysis
also showed that this relapsed AML remained highly sensitive
to another FDA-approved kinase inhibitor, sunitinib. (Fig. 6D).

Treatment with daily sunitinib resulted in a signiﬁcant initial
response with rapid reduction in WBC counts and peripheral
leukemic blasts for a period of 4 weeks.

Discussion
Here, we show that functional screening of primary cells
from leukemia patients with a panel of kinase inhibitors can
identify effective kinase inhibitors in 70% of patients in just 3
days, including 40% of patient samples that were hypersensitive to drugs already approved for clinical use. We also show an
algorithm that uses the partially overlapping kinase target
spectra for each drug for prediction of critical kinase targets
that underlie inhibitor sensitivity patterns. Finally, using this
algorithm, we identify and rank probable kinase targets in 151
patients with a variety of hematologic malignancies.
The predicted kinase targets for these patient samples show
a great deal of heterogeneity, even within diagnostic subsets.
This ﬁnding highlights one of the strengths of this kinase
inhibitor screen—kinase targets and patient-speciﬁc therapeutic options are detected regardless of the frequency with which
these targeted therapies would be applicable within the given
disease subset. In addition, although our target prediction
algorithm can suggest candidate pathways for follow-up validation, this technique is empirical in that it does not require
speciﬁc knowledge of any genetic lesion or biomarker to
uncover potential therapeutic options for patients.
It is likely that the algorithm shown here exhibits both falsepositive and false-negative kinase targets. Because the algorithm is driven by our knowledge of potential target spectra
of kinase inhibitors that are present on the panel, there is
certainly an opportunity for target bias due to pathways that
are over- or under-represented on the panel. As drug development continues and the panel expands to include other drugs
that offer more complete and even coverage of the kinome,
this pitfall will be diminished. In addition, further proﬁling of
these inhibitors to fully delineate target spectra will also
improve the algorithm output as this output is largely driven,
and limited, by our knowledge of these target spectra.
It is also possible that the setup of the assay could lead to
false-negative results, as the technique relies on a short 3-day
window for assessment of drug sensitivity. For this reason,
interpretation of negative results from the drug assay (i.e., lack
of sensitivity to a particular drug) must be taken with caution.
Correlation of results from this screen with clinical cases in
which patients are treated with drugs from the panel will help
inform the full clinical relevance of both positive and negative
assay results.
It will be critical to integrate this kinase inhibitor screen with
other cutting edge techniques. We have already begun to apply
this assay in conjunction with a related siRNA screen (49, 50),
and initial results obtained within 4 days of receiving fresh

primary samples indicate a high concordance of siRNA and
kinase inhibitor sensitivities. In addition, application of genomics techniques such as gene expression microarray and deep
sequencing in parallel with these functional screening tools
will undoubtedly accelerate our understanding of the precise
molecular events that underlie the observed kinase sensitivity
patterns. Matching of these patient genotypes with drug
sensitivity patterns will ultimately enable patients to be treated
on the basis of tumor genotypes, and this drug assay and kinase
target algorithm offer useful modalities for translation of
tumor genotypes into therapeutically relevant clinical strategies. Hence, the kinase inhibitor screen illustrated here represents advancement toward individual patient-tailored cancer
therapy. Malignant cells from patients with cancer can be
economically screened to identify effective targeted therapies
within 3 days, thus matching the appropriate drugs with the
appropriate patients on a timescale that affords opportunity
for informed, mechanism-based intervention.
