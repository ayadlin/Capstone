ABSTRACT
The acquired drug resistance would influence the efficacy of cisplatin-based
chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer. The present study aimed to investigate
the correlation of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) H19 with cisplatin-resistance and
clinical outcome in lung adenocarcinoma. In our study, the expression of H19 in
cisplatin-resistant A549/DDP cells was unregulated. Knockdown of H19 restored
the response of A549/DDP cells to cisplatin. H19-mediated chemosensitivity
enhancement was associated with metastasis, induction of G0/G1 cell-cycle arrest,
cell proliferation, and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, lncRNA H19 expression
was significantly related to TNM stage and metastasis (P = 0.012). Overexpression
of H19 was negatively correlated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy response in
patients. Patients with high H19 expression exhibited a significantly shorter median
progression-free survival (PFS) [4.7 months] than the low-expression patients
(6.3months) [P = 0.002]. In summary, H19-mediated regulation of cisplatin resistance
in human lung adenocarcinoma cells is demonstrated for the first time. H19 could
potentially serve as a molecular marker to predict the clinical outcomes of lung
adenocarcinoma patients.

INTRODUCTION

promote our understanding of NSCLC treatment failure
and development.
Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) stand for a
new class of non-protein-coding RNAs. They are typically
longer than 200 nt and do not function as templates for
protein synthesis [7–10]. It has been shown that altered
lncRNA would lead to aberrant expression of gene
products, which will lead to different disease condition,
cancer included [11, 12]. LncRNA-H19 gene represents
to be one of the first group of genes, which has proved
to be maternally expressed and paternally imprinted.
Accumulating evidence indicates that H19 gene is
an oncogenic lncRNA in bladder and hepatocellular

Lung cancer is one of the most common fatal
cancers worldwide, with a 5-year survival as low as 13%
[1, 2]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts
for 80– 85% of all the lung cancers [3]. Currently, most
standard initial treatment strategies for advanced NSCLC
involve platinum-based doublet chemotherapy with
the use of cisplatin as an effective cytotoxic agent in
combination with other agents [4, 5]. However, the efficacy
of cisplatin treatment would be impaired by emergence
of chemoresistance [6]. Therefore, further elucidation of
molecular mechanisms underlying chemoresistance would

carcinoma and breast cancer [13–19]. While H19 exhibits
oncogenic functions in some types of cancer, it also acts
as a tumor suppressor [20, 21], depending on the type of
cancer and cellular context. Thus, the discovery of lncRNA
H19 may be ascribed a major role in chemoresistance in
cancer cells [22]; the mechanism underlying NSCLC is
yet unclear.
In the current study, we observed the potential
mechanisms, biological function and clinical feature of
lncRNA H19 in lung adenocarcinoma. Combined together,
this research studies the potential of H19, taking it as a
valid therapeutic target for the cisplatin resistance reversal
in patients suffering from lung adenocarcinoma.

As refractoriness to apoptosis induced by cisplatin
is one of the major features of resistance to chemotherapy
in NSCLC [23], the effect of H19 on cell apoptosis was
examined. We observed that the expressions of FAS,
BAK, and BAX (the activation of which may be involved
in cell apoptosis) were increased post transfection by siH19-2 (Figure 3A). However, other apoptosis markers
such as BAD, caspases3, and caspase8 did not alter
significantly (Supplementary Figure S1). A considerably
higher percentage of apoptotic cells were found in si-H19-2
treated cells (24.5%) in comparison with those transfected
with negative control (12.1%) and blank group (8.1%)
(Figure 3B). Moreover, we found that the percentage of
si-H19-2 A549/DDP cells contained in G0/G1 and subG1
phases in cell cycle increased while the percentage of
S phase cells reduced with the growing cisplatin doses
(Figure 3C). These results indicate that inhibition of H19
induces apoptosis in cells resistant to cisplatin. Since
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a critical
role in resistance to cisplatin-resistant, an increase of
mesenchymal markers such as Vimentin [24, 25] determines
the relationship between H19 and EMT markers. The data in
Figure 3D indicated that knockdown of H19 enhanced
the expression of Vimentin. The down-regulation of H19
also significantly decreased cell migration, as what is
confirmed via quantitative analysis by a transwell system.
The average proportion of the siH19-treated cell lines
was decreased down to 26.7 ± 1.31% (P < 0.05) and
95.2 ± 0.63 % in the NC cells (P > 0.05), compared with the
blank control (Figure 3E). To sum up, these findings indicate
that H19 expression may active cell apoptosis and migration
to promote resistance to cisplatin.

RESULTS
Overexpression of H19 was correlated with
acquired resistance to cisplatin
The CCK-8 assay is used to test the cisplatin
sensitivity. As shown in Figure 1A, the IC50 of cisplatin
in the cell line of drug-resistant A549/DDP was about
17.06 ± 0.23 μg/mL. This was 3.4 folder higher compared
with the cell line of A549, which is 5.02 ± 0.28 μg/mL.
Thus, A549/DDP cells showed increased resistance
against cisplatin compared with parental cells. To further
ascertain whether H19 plays an important role in the
acquired cisplatin resistance of lung adenocarcinoma
cells. The qRT-PCR assay was used to examine the H19
expression in A549/DDP cells and was detected to be
dramatically increased almost about 6.3-fold (P < 0.01;
Figure 1B). In the case of parental A549 cells being
treated with different concentration of cisplatin, qRTPCR showed a dramatic increase in the H19 expression
(Figure 1C). Therefore, the growing expression H19
level in adenocarcinoma cells would respond to cisplatin
treatment.

Impact of overexpression of H19 on pathological
characteristics and PFS in NSCLC patients
receiving cisplatin therapy

The cisplatin sensivitiy in cisplatin resistant
human lung adenocarcinoma cell line was
restored by H19 inhibition (A549/DDP)

As shown in Table 1, the H19 expression level
in tissues was closely correlated with the metastasis
(P = 0.012) and TNM stage (P = 0.012). However,
no significant correlation was found between other
clinicopathological parameters (including family history,
pathological types, smoking history, gender and age)
and H19 expression. ROC curve analysis established
the optimal cut-off value 1.178 of H19 expression level
in 136 adenocarcinoma tissues, which yielded an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.751 (P < 0.01). Therefore,
H19 achieved a diagnostic sensitivity of 72.79% and
specificity of 70.33% (Figure 4A). The cut-off value of
1.178 ng/mL of H19 was chosen to categorize patients
as low H19 (n = 69) or high H19 (n = 77). According to
the Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, patients with
low H19 have longer median PFS (6.3 months; 95% CI =
0.1912–1.282) compared with those with high expression,

To assess the function of H19 in acquired cisplatinresistant A549/DDP cells, the silencing capacity of siH19-2 was evaluated by qRT-PCR. Si-H19-2 showed
an optimal gene-silencing effect in comparison with
si-H19-1 and the negative control (NC) (P < 0.01)
[Figure 2A]. Thus, siRNA/H19-2 was utilized in the
subsequent experiments. Then, the CCK-8 assay was
used to examine the effect of H19 expression on IC50
of cisplatin to A549/DDP cells. The outcomes revealed
that siRNA/H19 would decrease the IC50 of cisplatin on
A549/DDP cells significantly with a rate of 47.12%, and
the sensitivity to cisplatin was partially restored (P < 0.05;
Figure 2B). Thus, H19 may play a vital role in cisplatin
resistance in lung adenocarcinoma cancer.

H19 expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues
is correlated with the patients’ clinical response
to cisplatin-based chemotherapy

which is about (4.7 months; 95% = 1.516–6.709) [Figure 4B].
As shown in Table 2, the Cox proportional hazards analysis
was adopted to further assess the expression level of H19 as
a prognostic biomarker. According to the univariate analysis,
the expression level of H19 was associated with prognosis
(HR 2.384; P = 0.008) while the multivariate analysis
significantly associated high H19 to a shorter PFS (HR
2.224; P = 0.016). As expected, it is found that the disease
stage was closely associated with decreased PFS in both
univariate and multivariate analysis (P < 0.05).

To have a better understanding of the H19
expression in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and the
clinical response to cisplatin-based regimens, qRT-PCR
was used to examine the H19 levels on tumor tissues
among 136 eligible patients treated with cisplatinbased chemotherapy. We analyzed patient responses to

H19 was the first imprinting lncRNA, expressed in
the maternal allele rather than paternal and is transcribed
for the H19/IGF2 gene cluster existed in human
chromosome 11p15.5 [31, 32]. H19 is demonstrated
to be correlated with drug resistance in liver, breast,
and bladder cancer [33–35]. Herein, in order to obtain
the insight into the molecular mechanisms of H19 in
cisplatin resistance in NSCLC, we made a comparison
between cisplatin-resistant and cisplatin-sensitive human
lung cancer cells by qRT-PCR and found that H19 is
upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cells. Therefore, H19
may be suggested as an oncogenic factor in cisplatin
resistance of NSCLC.
To our knowledge, this is the first report to link
H19 gene with lung adenocarcinoma cisplatin resistance.
We observed that H19 knockdown could partially restore
the sensitivity of A549/DDP cells. Based on our clinical
data, it can be inferred that the lncRNA H19 expression
was significantly connected with the metastasis and TNM
stage. Patients with high H19 level are strongly negatively
associated with the patients’ response to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy. Patients with low H19 expression have

platinum-based chemotherapy (Table 3). Patients with
high H19 expression (≥ 1.178 ng/mL), platinum-based
chemotherapy was significantly less effective than in those
with low H19 expression (< 1.178 ng/mL) [P = 0.015;
P = 0.034, respectively]. Thus, to conclude, H19
expression was negatively correlated with patients’
response to platinum-based chemotherapy.

DISCUSSION
Acquired resistance is one of the major barriers
coming across in cancer chemotherapy. Many studies have
illustrated the substaintial epigenetic alterations contained in
drug-resistant lung cancer cells though evidence about the
genetic alteration following chemotherapeutic treatment is
constrained [26, 27]. Some studies have also demonstrated
the role of lncRNAs in chemoresistance regulation [28–30].
However, the general contribution of lncRNAs to cisplatin
resistance keeps unknown largely. Therefore, we explored
the underlying molecular mechanism of lncRNAs in
acquired resistance to cisplatin in NSCLC.

Figure 4: (A) Using a cut-off value 1.178 ng/mL, ROC analysis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.751 (P < 0.01), indicating

a diagnostic sensitivity of 72.79% and specificity of 70.33% to differentiate high or low H19 expression levels from NSCLC patients.
(B) Survival curves were analyzed by log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier method. Patients with low H19 levels had a dramatically longer
survival than those with high H19 levels (P = 0.002).

dramatically longer median PFS than those with high
expression. The univariate and multivariate analysis of
PFS revealed that H19 and tumor stage were independent
prognostic factors. The clinical data were consistent with
the cell experiments and further confirmed our hypothesis.
The present results were similar to those of other lncRNAs
associated with cancer prognosis. HOTAIR expression
from patients diagnosed with stage IV colorectal cancer
(CRC) was demonstrated to associated with poor
prognosis [36, 37]. MALAT1 (metastasis associated lung
adenocarcinoma transcript 1) has also been associated
with the poor prognosis and metastasis NSCLC patients
[38]. Additionally, H19 is correlated with poor prognosis
and is upregulated in gastric cancer [21, 39, 40].
Notably, the chemoresistance of bladder cancer
cells is increased by UCA1 through regulating the
Wnt signaling [41]. HOTAIR, has been proved to be
upregulated in lung cancer. Besides, it also regulated the
chemoresistance via the modulation of cell cycle and
apoptosis [28]. Our study indicated that the siRNA H19
increasing the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma cells to
cisplatin might be correlated with G0/G1 cell cycle arrest,
apoptosis enhancement and migration. We found that the
knockdown of H19 was related to apoptosis proteins FAS,
BAX, and BAK. Consecutively, other researches have
illustrated that lncRNA H19 was actively associated with
the E2F1 (E2F transcription factor 1) to promote the cellcycle progression of breast cancer cells [42]. In addition,
the effects of H19 on cell proliferation and invasiveness
in our study were similar to those of H19 promoting
pancreatic cancer metastasis. It is achieved by suppressing
Let-7 over target HMGA2-mediated EMT [43]. These
studies substantiate our results.
Therefore, we consider that H19 may play a major
role in overcoming acquired resistance to cisplatin as a
novel epigenetic regulator in lung adenocarcinoma such
as ERCC1 [44], and sensitizing H19 might be an efficient
therapeutic intervention in cisplatin resistance of lung
adenocarcinoma. However, further investigations are
imperative in order to elucidate the mechanisms H19mediated regulatory pathway of migration and cisplatin
resistance. Furthermore, these data will lay the foundation
to explore the related genes’ expression, their regulation,
and function. These studies will provide insight for the
improvement of the clinical treatment and prediction of
NSCLC patients.

contained 5% CO2 at 37°C and also 10% fetal calf serum
(Gibco, Gran Island, NY, USA). Moreover, 2 mg/L
cisplatin was contained in the A549/DDP cell medium
to keep its drug-resistant phenotype. The subsequent
experiments will use cells in the logarithmic phase of
growth.

To assess the lncRNA H19 inhibition, 50 nM of
lncRNA H19 siRNA (GuangZhou RIBO, China) were
transfected into A549/DDP cells by Lipofectamine 2000
based on manufacturer’s instructions. Cells transfected
with the scrambled siRNA have been adopted as the
negative control. The cells were collected 48 h after
the transfection. Three pairs of siRNA named siRNA
H19-1, siRNA H19-2 and siRNA H19-3. Compared
with control, the expression level of lncRNA H19
was only decreased successfully by si-H19-2. The
target sequence of si-H19-2 was listed as follows: 3′dTdTGGAGAUCGAACCUUUACUU-5′, the antisense
strand, 5′- CCUCUAGCUUGGAAAUGAAdTdT-3′ and

MATERIALS AND METHODS

RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR

Cell lines and cell culture

Total RNA was extracted from tissues using an
RNeasy MINI Kit (QIAGEN) or cell lines using the
TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). Coming to qRT-PCR
assay, RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA from 1.0 μg
total RNA through a Reverse Transcription Kit (Takara,
Japan). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analyses were conducted
using Power SYBER Green (Takara, Shiga, Japan). All

Patients and tissue samples
A total of 136 tumor tissue samples were harvested
from advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients who treated
with cisplatin-based chemotherapy at Shanghai Pulmonary
Hospital during January 2011 to November 2013. The

protocols have been carried out based on the instructions
offered by manufacturer. H19 primers were designed by
Sangon Biotech (China). Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (GADPH) was used as an endogenous
control. ABI 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems, CA, USA) was adopted to perform the qRTPCR assays.

The A549/DDP cells were seeded in 6-well plates.
Afterward, they were transfected through negative control
and si-H19-2. These cells were resuspended in binding
buffer, washed with PBS twice and trypsinized after 48 h.
Then, Annexin V/PI (Invitrogen, USA) was used to stain
the cells for 15 min in the dark at the room temperature.
Then, cell population analysis was conducted by flow
cytometry.

In vitro chemosensitivity assay

Cell migration assays

The in vitro chemosensitivity of cisplatin-resistant
and parental A549 cells to cisplatin was determined by
CCK-8 assay. Briefly, cells have been seeded into 96-well
plates (5 × 103 cells/well) and hence to make it possible
for overnight adherence. Subsequently, the cells were
treated with various concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8,
1.6, 3.2, 6.4, 12.8, and 25.6 μg/mL) of cisplatin. 10 μL of
CCK-8 (Cell Counting Kit-8, C04-13; Dojindo
Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) was put into each well
after 48 h and was incubated for 4 h under 37°C. A microplate reader at 450 nM has been used to analyze the plates.
Every experiment was done more than three times.

Coming to the migration assays, at 48 h posttransfection, 5 × 104 cells in serum-free media were put
into the upper chamber (8 µm pore size; Millipore) of
the insert, the lower chamber was added with medium
containing 10% FBS. After 24 h-incubation, the cells
contained in the upper membrane were removed by cotton
wool. The cells that migrated through the membrane were
stained with methanol and 0.1% crystal violet, imaged,
and counted using an IX7 inverted microscope (Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). Experiments were conducted three times
independently.

Western blot assay

Statistical analysis

The siRNAs were transfected into the cells. Whole
protein lysates were extracted from the cells with RIPA
lysis buffer (KenGEN, China) and quantified by BCA
Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime, China). Then, 30 μg
lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore, USA). The membrane was
blocked with 5% nonfat milk. Then, it was incubated
with primary antibodies against BAK, BAX, FAS and
Vimentin, followed by incubation with a horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz;
USA). GADPH served as the loading control (CST, USA).
The membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat milk

This study was supported by grants from the
National Natural Science Foundation of China (No.
81372392 and 81172101), Key project of the Science
and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality
(No. 11JC1411301), Natural Science Foundation
of Tianjin Medical University (No. 2015KYZQ13)
and Postdoctoral Science Foundation of China (No.
2016M591398).

Cells were plated in 6-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well).
24 h post transfection of siRNA H19-2 as described above,
A549/DDP cells were treated by DDP at a final concentration
of 5 mg/L. The propidium iodide stained the cells after 24 h.
The BD Cycle Test Plus DNA Reagent Kit (BD Biosciences,
Shanghai, China) has been used in the cell-cycle analysis,
following the protocol offered by the manufacturer. The cells
were analyzed by FAC scan (BD Biosciences, Shanghai,
China), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1, S, or G2/M
phase was estimated. Every experiment was conducted at
least three times.
