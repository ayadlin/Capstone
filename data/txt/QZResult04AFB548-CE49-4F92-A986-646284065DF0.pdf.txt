Abstract
Accurate preclinical predictions of the clinical efﬁcacy of experimental cancer drugs are highly desired but
often haphazard. Such predictions might be improved by incorporating elements of the tumor microenvironment
in preclinical models by providing a more physiological setting. In generating improved xenograft models, it is
generally accepted that the use of primary tumors from patients are preferable to clonal tumor cell lines. Here we
describe an interdisciplinary platform to study drug response in multiple myeloma, an incurable cancer of the
bone marrow. This platform uses microﬂuidic technology to minimize the number of cells per experiment, while
incorporating three-dimensional extracellular matrix and mesenchymal cells derived from the tumor microenvironment. We used sequential imaging and a novel digital imaging analysis algorithm to quantify changes in cell
viability. Computational models were used to convert experimental data into dose-exposure–response "surfaces,"
which offered predictive utility. Using this platform, we predicted chemosensitivity to bortezomib and melphalan,
two clinical multiple myeloma treatments, in three multiple myeloma cell lines and seven patient-derived
primary multiple myeloma cell populations. We also demonstrated how this system could be used to investigate
environment-mediated drug resistance and drug combinations that target it. This interdisciplinary preclinical
assay is capable of generating quantitative data that can be used in computational models of clinical response,
demonstrating its utility as a tool to contribute to personalized oncology. Cancer Res; 74(1); 56–67. 2013 AACR.

Major Findings
By designing an experimental platform with the speciﬁc
intent of generating experimental parameters for a computational clinical model of personalized therapy in multiple
myeloma, while taking in consideration the limitations of
working with patient primary cells, and the need to incorporate elements of the tumor microenvironment, we have
generated patient-individualized estimations of initial
response and time to relapse to chemotherapeutic agents.

Introduction
The purposes of preclinical systems range from early identiﬁcation of compounds with anticancer activity, estimation of
patient-speciﬁc clinical response, or the discovery of novel
targetable cellular mechanisms (6, 7). All available systems

have strengths and limitations: in vitro assays using cell lines
are scalable, reproducible, and inexpensive, but cell lines are
signiﬁcantly different from their originating tumors (8), and
the tumor microenvironment's effects are often absent in these
assays. Animal models include more realistic elements such as
drug pharmacokinetics and inﬂuence of the tumor microenvironment, but they often rely on cell lines, require long-term
experiments, and carry signiﬁcant ﬁnancial cost. Irrespective
of the preclinical model used, the data generated cannot be
directly ported into clinical estimations without the help of an
adequate computational framework.
Computational modeling has long been used to study the
dynamics of tumor response to therapy, as well as emergence
of drug resistance (9–11). These theoretical models are powerful tools for analyzing complex interactions like the tumorhost-therapy system, and could, in a near future, become
decision-support systems for oncologists, making personalized
oncology a possibility (12). The Achilles' heel of such models,
however, is the reliability of the experimental data used to
parameterize them. More often than not, these computational
models are parameterized by data from literature, in many
cases from experiments that have been performed at incompatible conditions.
We propose that preclinical assays, speciﬁcally designed to
generate data to parameterize such computational models,
would signiﬁcantly advance the ﬁeld. Such assays, however,
should comply with minimum requirements: (i) compatibility
with patient primary cancer cells; (ii) recapitulate the tumor
microenvironment, namely extra-cellular matrix and stroma;
(iii) be nondestructive, so longitudinal studies can be performed, incorporating the temporal dimension; (iv) require as

Assay for Chemosensitivity in Multiple Myeloma

Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions
Analysis of experimental data
The default function of dose–response was written as equation A, and the data points were the normalized viability in each
region of interest (ROI) at a given time point and drug concentration:

The goodness-of-ﬁt was calculated from a linear regression of the points of the ﬁt equation with the actual observed
experimental points using Prism 5 (GraphPad) and quantifying the slope and R2 of the regression. The complete Matlab code is
available in the Supplementary Material. For each example, two hypotheses were tested: either the sample was composed of 1 or 2
subpopulations. When no signiﬁcant differences were observed in R2, the simplest model was used (1 population).
Equation A is the simplest expression that describes how a homogenous population of multiple myeloma cells responds to
chemotherapy as a function of concentration and exposure time. A growth term was included in the numerator of equation A,
where T is the doubling time and DT is the variable representing drug exposure time. Rx represents the drug concentration to which
cells are exposed, whereas IC50Rx, IC50DT, exp Rx, and exp T are constants that determine the drug concentration and exposure
time that causes death of 50% of the multiple myeloma cells and the steepness of the slope of the viability curve, respectively.
The alkylating agent melphalan has a short half-life in media and in vivo of approximately 2 hours, mainly because of hydrolysis
(1). We have observed, however, that in long-term experiments, cells continue to die a week after melphalan exposure (see Results).
For this class of drugs, we have created a mathematical expression that encompasses drug half-life, DNA damage, and DNA
damage–induced cell death (equation B).

"Death" and "Growth" are the two functions that determine the changes in number of viable cells in a given drug concentration, at a
certain time point. "Death" represents the probability that any given cell from a population will die as a function of accumulated DNA
damage ("CumulDamage"), which in turn is proportional to the area under the curve (AUC) of drug concentration Rx and exposure
time dt. "exp DMG" is an empirical exponent. "Growth" quantiﬁes cell replication, which depends on the drug-free doubling time T, the
amount of DNA damage "CumulDamage," and an empirical proportional constant KT. In other words, DNA damage slows replication
(2). The last expression means that the concentration of active melphalan in media, Rx, decays with a half-life TMel of 2 hours.
Equation B is an empirical expression, with the goal of interpolating the data points across time and concentration dimensions,
while recapitulating known mechanisms of melphalan toxicity and degradation. It is not, however, the only possible expression
possible, and it may not properly compute the viability in concentrations or exposure times signiﬁcantly higher than the experimental
conditions.
Computational modeling of therapy
In this computational model, one or more subpopulations are represented, each with a size, a doubling time, and a level of
sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent tested. Carrying capacity, which is the maximum theoretical growth rate of the entire
tumor burden, was estimated from the labeling index commonly observed in multiple myeloma patients (1–3%). Intratumoral
competition was modeled by an equation that determines that bigger populations have higher chance of replicating than smaller
ones (equation C), a dynamic similar to genetic drift.

Equation C describes how the size of a subpopulation within the tumor burden (Ni) changes within an interval of time (dt) in
response of drug-induced cell death induced by exposure to a drug at the concentration Rx for the interval of time dt. The surviving
cells may replicate at a rate determined by their labeling index (LI), the duration of their cell cycle (T), and the percentage that the
subpopulation represents in the total tumor burden.
Bortezomib concentration in blood is characterized by a peak of 100 nmol/L, followed by a sharp decrease, and a stable
concentration of 1 to 3 nmol/L between 2 and 192 hours after intravenous administration (1.3 mg/m2; refs. 3, 4). The in vitro
chemosensitivity data from patients 8, 11, 12, and 13 parameterized the computational models of clinical response for each of these
patients in a hypothetical single-agent bortezomib regimen, in which the bone marrow concentration would remain constant at
3 nmol/L.
As a preliminary validation of the correlation between in vitro and in vivo chemosensitivity, we have used computational models
parameterized by assays with the human multiple myeloma cell line NCI-H929 to estimate the response to bortezomib treatment
of a subcutaneous mouse model treated with 1 mg/kg bortezomib bi-weekly (5). Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that such
intravenous injections in mice cause a peak blood concentration of 0.5 nmol/L and 0.4 nmol/L at 48 hours. For these
simulations, we consider a stable 0.4 nmol/L concentration of bortezomib in the bone marrow of these mice along the treatment.
NCI-H929 cells have a cell cycle of approximately 24 hours, and in the subcutaneous model, the tumors have a doubling time of
approximately 3.5 days, indicating that in this animal model, approximately 20% of H929 cells are actively replicating at a given
time, which was used as labeling index in the simulations.

few cells per experimental condition as possible, so each
patient sample could be tested against a panel of chemotherapeutic agents, in different environmental conditions; and (v)
the data generated should result in testable clinical predictions, such as the depth of response and/or progression-free
survival (PFS).
Four decades ago, Salmon and colleagues (13) proposed an
in vitro method for estimation of clinical response of patients
with cancer based on the capacity of primary cancer cells to
form colonies at physiologically reachable chemotherapy concentrations. The main limitation of these early assays, however,
was the small number of patient samples that were capable of
forming colonies under control conditions. With a cloning
efﬁciency between 0.001% and 0.1%, the growth of colonies in
vitro was a challenge comparable to surviving the chemotherapeutic insult itself. Consequently, these restrictions limited
the number of drugs, concentrations, and time points that
could be studied for a single patient (14), even in more recent
models (15). Finally, the outcome of these assays were often
dichotomized, in other words, either a patient was "sensitive"
or "resistant" to the drug, but no information was provided
regarding duration of response and time to relapse. Given that
in many cancers the overall survival is more dependent on the
duration of the response than on its depth (16, 17), the
application of these early assays as predictive biomarkers was
somewhat limited.
Similar to Leonardo Da Vinci's "aerial screw," designed in
the 15th century, which only came to fruition as the helicopter 5 centuries later, we propose that Salmon's drug
sensitivity assay was hindered by technological limitations
of its time, not by an inherent design fault. Building on this
pioneering work, we here describe a novel approach for
preclinical assessment of drug efﬁcacy. We apply this method to multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell malignancy in which cancer cells uncontrollably proliferate in the
bone marrow. Adhesion to bone marrow's extracellular
matrix or stroma has been shown to confer de novo multi-

drug resistance [environment-mediated drug resistance
(EMDR); refs. 18, 19].
The here described system combines a microﬂuidic dose–
response platform, for in vitro screening of drugs, and a
computational model of clinical response. The in vitro component consists of a 3-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the
bone marrow microenvironment, including primary multiple
myeloma cells, extracellular matrix, and patient-derived stroma and growth factors. Live microscopy and digital image
analysis are used to detect cell death events in different drug
concentrations, which are used to generate dose–response
surfaces. The in silico component is an evolutionary computational model designed to simulate how a heterogeneous
population of cancer cells responds to therapy. From the in
vitro data, the model identiﬁes the size and chemosensitivity of
subpopulations within the patient's tumor burden, and simulates how the tumor would respond to the drug(s) in physiological conditions in a clinical regimen.
The main innovations of this platform are: (i) small number
of cancer cells required (1,000–10,000 per experiment); (ii)
assessment of drug efﬁcacy in different environmental conditions (collagen  patient stroma  patient-derived growth
factors/cytokines), allowing quantiﬁcation of innate and environmental drug resistance; (iii) only bright ﬁeld imaging is
used, thus no toxicity from viability markers; (iv) continuous
imaging provides drug effect as a function of concentration and
exposure time; and (v) the integration between in vitro and
computational evolutionary models, to estimate clinical outcome: not only the initial response, but also PFS, a more
relevant clinical endpoint for assessment of drug efﬁcacy (16).
In this article, we describe the experimental and computational platforms, the results with human myeloma cells lines,
and how they compare with literature data. We also describe
preliminary experiments with patient primary cells, and how
these results could be used in the estimation of clinical efﬁcacy
of experimental drugs, or personalized medicine (the right
drugs and the right regimen for each patient).

Assay for Chemosensitivity in Multiple Myeloma

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The human myeloma cell lines RPMI-8226, HS-5/GFPlabeled, NCI-H929, and 8226/LR-5 were kindly provided by Dr.
William Dalton's laboratory. The 8226/dsRed2 cell line was
stably transfected with the ﬂuorescent protein dsRed2. All cells
were maintained in culture with RPMI 1640 (Gibco) media
supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (Life Technologies) and 1% penicillin–streptomycin solution (Invitrogen), in
incubators at 5% CO2, 37 C. Melphalan-resistant 8226/LR-5
cells were maintained in 5 mmol/L melphalan in medium,
and cultured in drug-free medium for 2 weeks before the
experiments.
Primary cancer cells
We investigated the in vitro response of cancer cells from 7
patients with multiple myeloma in the clinical trial MCC#
14745 conducted at the H. Lee Mofﬁtt Cancer Center and
Research Institute, as approved by the Institutional Review
Board. The medical records were deidentiﬁed and only the
following clinical-relevant information was reviewed: (i) treatment administered (chemotherapeutic agents, doses, and
schedule) before biopsy; (ii) cytogenetics; and (iii) blood and
urine electrophoresis results. Patients in trial MCC# 14745
received standard-of-care treatment, and consented to provide
an extra sample of bone marrow aspirate during a routine
biopsy. These aspirates were used in the in vitro assays further
described. After informed written consent, bone marrow aspirates were obtained from patients with multiple myeloma
either newly diagnosed or with refractory disease. Processing
of bone marrow aspirate and selection of multiple myeloma
cells is described in Supplementary Material. Multiple myeloma cells were seeded into the Ibidi m-slide Chemotaxis 3D
device under experimental culture conditions (described
below) within 4 hours of each patient biopsy.
In vitro procedures
Drugs. In this work, the following chemotherapeutic
agents were tested: bortezomib (acquired from Selleckchem),
melphalan (from Sigma), and ﬂuorescent molecule ﬂuorescein
(FAM)-HYD-1 (kindly provided by Dr. Hazlehurst).
In vitro dose–response assays in 3D microﬂuidic chambers. Commercially available 3D cell-culture slides (m-slide
Chemotaxis 3D Ibitreat from Ibidi, LLC) were gas and temperature equilibrated at 37 C, 5% CO2 overnight before cell seeding. Each slide is composed of 3 separate chambers each with a
1-mm wide, 50-mm high cell-viewing chamber that holds a
volume of 6 mL. It is connected to two 65 mL reservoirs along
both sides. Linear chemical gradients form across the cell
chamber via passive diffusion. Aliquots consisting of 6.67 mL
10 MEM (Life Technologies), 6.67 mL deionized H2O, 3.33 mL
7.5% sodium bicarbonate solution (Life Technologies), and
16.67 mL 1 RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) were premixed and
stored at 4 C before experiments, as per manufacturer (Ibidi)
instructions. Fifty microliters of 3.1 mg/mL Bovine collagen
type I (Advanced BioMatrix) was added at time of seeding. A
total of 16.67 mL of cells suspended in RPMI 1640 were mixed
into the collagen/media mix to a ﬁnal volume of 100 mL in

www.aacrjournals.org

1.5 mg/mL bovine collagen I (6-fold dilution of RPMI 1640 cell
suspension). Six microliters of this cell/matrix mix were used
to load each viewing chamber. For cell lines in single culture or
mixed culture, the ﬁnal concentration of cells was 3  106
myeloma cells/mL. For patient primary cells, the densities
were 7  106 cells/mL for multiple myeloma (CD138þ) and
1  106 cells/mL for mesenchymal cells. These cell densities
were optimized to better reﬂect physiological cell density and
maximize the number of cells in the observation chamber,
while still maintaining enough separation to allow the individual identiﬁcation of cells. Cell lines were seeded at lower
density to account for their larger size and faster replication.
The interval between mixing collagen with cells and media and
seeding the chambers was kept below 5 minutes at ambient
temperature to minimize collagen polymerization. After seeding, an additional 15 minutes at room temperature allowed
adherent cells (HS-5 or patient stroma) to sink to the bottom
of the 3D chamber and keep the same focal plane for subsequent live imaging. Slides were then incubated at 37 C, 5% CO2
for 1 hour. Collagen polymerization was checked by visual
inspection of ﬁber formation on an inverted phase contrast
microscope with a 20 objective lens. After gelation, reservoirs
on each side of the slide were ﬁlled with 65 mL culture media. A
total of 16.25 mL of 4 drug in culture media was dropped onto
a ﬁlling port on the left reservoir and then an equal volume was
immediately drawn out of the other ﬁlling port. Slides were
then placed into incubator for live imaging. For each experiment, there was a control with no drug added, which was used
to detect spontaneous cell death. For single culture experiments, chemotherapy was added 2 to 4 hours after cell seeding.
For coculture experiments with adherent stroma (HS-5 or
patient stroma), drugs were added 24 hours later to ensure
stroma adhesion.
Continuous versus pulsed exposure. In experiments with
continuous exposure, the drug was maintained in media for the
duration of the experiment. If this duration exceeded 48 hours,
the media on both reservoirs was completely removed, and
replaced by fresh media, to which drug was added as previously
described (16.25 mL at 4 concentration). In pulsed exposure
experiments, the media on both reservoirs was completely
removed and replaced by fresh media at the end of the pulsed
exposure.
Imaging
Image acquisition. Two different models of ﬂuorescence
microscopes were used for the experiments here described: the
ﬁrst, JULI (Digital Bio), is a portable ﬂuorescence microscope
with bright ﬁeld and red ﬂuorescence capacities (ex/em 630
nm/660 nm), which was maintained inside a standard incubator for the duration of the experiments. The second platform
was the EVOS FL (AMG), a bench top ﬂuorescence microscope
(red channel ex/em 531 nm/593 nm), which required the use of
a stage-top heating stage/incubator (Ibidi), which maintained
the cells at 37 C, 5% CO2, and 80% humidity. For the experiments here described, images were acquired every 5-minute
intervals. In experiments where the red ﬂuorescent 8226/
dsRed2 cell line was tested, or the cell-death molecular probe
ethidium homodimer-1 (EthD-1) was used, both bright ﬁeld

and red ﬂuorescent channels were imaged, the ﬁrst for changes
in cell morphology and membrane motion, and the second for
loss of innate ﬂuorescence or activity of EthD-1, respectively.
Quantiﬁcation of drug concentration over time within
microﬂuidic device. To quantify the shape and stability of
the drug gradient in the microﬂuidic device, we used a ﬂuorophore-conjugated of the peptide HYD-1 (1.5 kDa) within the
dose–response assay, a 3D gel matrix consisting of 1.5 mg/mL
bovine collagen I with RPMI1640/MEM media was placed into
the culture chamber of the Ibidi microﬂuidics device. After 45
minutes incubation at 37 C, reservoirs were ﬁlled with
RPMI1640 media 10% heat inactivated FBS, 1% penicillin–
streptomycin. FAM-HYD1 was diluted into media before replacing one fourth of the volume in the left reservoir with
ﬂuorescent drug solution (1/10 of stock). Fluorescence within
the culture chamber was imaged in an EVOS FL microscope
using the GFP ﬁlter (ex/em 470 nm/525 nm, 5 objective) with
heated stage and gas incubation (37 C, 5% CO2). Images were
acquired at 1-minute intervals for 24 hours.
Digital image analysis. With a stable drug gradient established across the main channel of the microﬂuidic slide, we
arbitrarily divided the observation channel into 5 sections, or
ROIs, each with an average drug concentration of 100%, 80%,
60%, 40%, and 20% of the concentration in the drug reservoir,
respectively. Sectioning the channel into 5 areas was a compromise between a minimum number of cells in each area, and
the rounding because of the averaging of the drug concentrations across each section. Dose–response was quantiﬁed with a
macro developed for the software ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.
gov/ij), further described. As discussed in the Results section,
membrane-impermeable probes for detection of cell death,
such as EthD-1, present a signiﬁcant variation in the time for
ﬂuorescence acquisition after death in cell lines or patient
samples. To avoid this confounding effect, we have developed a
novel approach that identiﬁes cell death based of motion of the
membrane, described later.
Assessment of cell viability through membrane motion
detection. We have observed that, although it was not possible to clearly discern a dead from a live cell based on the
morphology in the bright ﬁeld of a single image, all live cells
suspended within the collagen matrix had observable membrane motion or shape changes, between 2 images taken in a 5min interval. These morphological changes abruptly stopped
before cell death, indicating that this feature could be exploited
as a marker for cell death. We created a macro for the open
source software ImageJ using the plugins TurboReg (20) and
RunningZProjector (http://valelab.ucsf.edu/index.html). The
macro quantiﬁes the amount of cell membrane motion in the
different regions of interest, and writes a ﬁle with this information for each frame, or time point. The source code of the macro
is provided in the Supplementary Material. Brieﬂy, the macro
loads the stack of bright ﬁeld images taken at 5-minute intervals,
and aligns them using the plugin TurboReg. This action removes
translational motion, such as sliding of the microﬂuidic chamber, as well as vibration. Next, the native ImageJ "background
subtraction" function was used with parameters "rolling ball
radius ¼ 1 pixel" and "sliding parabolic" (21). Background
subtraction served to normalize image sequences across differ-

60

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

ent experiments and/or microscopes used to image the chambers, making cells appear as bright spots against a uniform dark
background. Motion and small variations in cell membranes
were detected using the plugin RunningZProjector. It detects
the maximum pixel intensity across a 6-frame/slice interval,
corresponding to 30 minutes. The original image was then
subtracted from the maximum pixel intensity projection, resulting in an image where actively moving membranes appear as
bright rings. ImageJ's Gaussian blur ﬁlter was used to convert
these bright rings into spots that cover the entire cell, and
produce the overlaid images shown in this article.
Validation of motion detection algorithm through ﬂuorescence. Different ﬂuorescent-labeling agents for cell viability were tested as live-imaging approaches for response to
chemotherapy. However, cytotoxicity, photo bleaching, intercellular variability of delay between cell death and signal
detection, and incomplete representation of viable/apoptotic/necrotic cell states added noise to the assay. A multiple
myeloma cell line was stably transfected with dsRed2 (8226/
dsRed2), and used as a reference to visually detect the cytotoxic
effect of drugs through loss of red ﬂuorescence. dsRed2
expression is an intrinsic marker for these cells: live cells will
quickly loose ﬂuorescence upon cell death because of membrane burst accompanied by release of cytoplasmic components, including the ﬂuorescent protein.
Validation of motion detection algorithm through bioluminescence. NCI-H929 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in
culture media or in a 3D collagen matrix with culture media
added on top of the cell/collagen layer. In wells without
collagen, 1.5  105 cells were resuspended in 50 mL of media
for a ﬁnal density of 3  106 cells/mL. To more closely resemble
microﬂuidic assay conditions, 1.5  105 cells were suspended
in 30 mL of 1.5 mg/mL collagen matrix and were left to
polymerize at 37 C for 1 hour. Twenty microliters of media
was then added as a separate phase on top of the cell/collagen
layer. Melphalan was serially diluted in 2-fold steps to a ﬁnal
concentration range of 100 to 1.56 mmol/L in 7 rows. The same
procedure was performed for bortezomib to ﬁnal concentrations of 20 to 0.31 nmol/L. All conditions and controls were
performed in triplicate. After 24 hours of continuous drug
exposure at 37 C and 5% CO2, 50 mL CellTiterGlo was added to
each well and the plates were placed on an orbital shaker at
room temperature for 10 minutes. Twenty minutes later,
bioluminescence was measured at ambient temperature on
a microplate reader. Percent cell viability was deﬁned as
luminescence normalized to controls at 24 hours.
Analysis of experimental data
The quantiﬁcation of the dose–response of the cells in the
experiment used Matlab's (MathWorks) function lsqcurveﬁt,
which ﬁnds the coefﬁcients that minimize the distance
between a function and a set of data points. Details on the

to therapy, we have used a computational model, previously
described (22), to simulate a hypothetical single-agent bortezomib regimen in an animal model (s.c. NCI-H929 in SCID
mouse), and for 4 patients whose multiple myeloma cells'
sensitivity to bortezomib were tested in vitro. Implementation
of the computational model of therapy is presented in the
Quick Guide to Equations and Assumptions.

Results
Characterization of shape and duration of drug gradient
The ﬁrst step of validating the in vitro platform was to
determine the stability, and also the duration of any transients
during the formation of the drug gradient across the observation
chamber. For this purpose, we used a conjugate of the FAM and
the 1.5 kDa peptide HYD-1, an experimental drug with direct
toxicity to multiple myeloma cells (23). We used live imaging to
quantify the ﬂuorescence in images taken at 1-minute intervals

during 18 hours (Fig. 1). The ﬂuorescent signal gradient was
stable for the interval of the experiment, and the transient time
for its formation was shorter than the period between drug
injection in the slide and start of imaging (5–100 ).
Loss of membrane motion is a reliable maker of cell
death
A novel algorithm for detection of cell membrane motion
was necessary to detect cell death in patient primary cells,
because of the signiﬁcant variation of the delay between cell
death and membrane permeabilization, and acquisition of
ﬂuorescence from molecular probes. Supplementary Fig. S1
depicts the delay between the detection of cell death using the
motion-detection algorithm, and loss of ﬂuorescence in the
stably transfected cell line 8226/dsRed2. Supplementary Fig. S2
exempliﬁes the delay of acquisition of the molecular probe
EthD-1 red ﬂuorescence in NCI-H929 cells.

composed of 2 side reservoirs, and one center observation chamber. Myeloma and stromal cells are loaded in the observation chamber simultaneously,
resuspended in collagen. Overnight, the matrix gelliﬁes and stromal cells adhere to the bottom of the chamber and stretch. B, one of the side reservoirs
is ﬁlled with medium with a chemotherapeutic agent (left), whreas the other is ﬁlled with standard growth medium (right). The diffusion of the chemotherapeutic
agent from one reservoir to the other creates a stable gradient across the observation chamber. C, the observation channel with the human multiple
myeloma cell line NCI-H929 and adherent bone marrow–derived stromal cell line HS-5 is shown in bright ﬁeld under a gradient of the necrosis-inducing
peptide HYD-1. Note that multiple myeloma cells on the left (higher drug concentration) have died and became dark spots, whereas cells on the right
(lower drug concentration) are still alive. D, a gradient of the ﬂuorescent-conjugated peptide FAM-HYD1 was established and ﬂuorescence quantiﬁed
across the channel during 18 hours. Normalization and rescaling to the minimum and maximum concentration within the observation channel conﬁrm the
linear stable gradient during the 18-hour window of experiment.

Effect of the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib
The cell line NCI-H929 was exposed to a stable gradient of
bortezomib (maximum concentration 10 nmol/L) for 24 hours,
and a dose–response surface was created (Fig. 2A). According
to these results, the bortezomib concentration that would lead
to a 50% reduction in the number of live cells after 24 hours,
compared with the initial time point, was 2.5 nmol/L. The
concentration that would lead to a 50% reduction in the
number of live cells, compared with the control at 24 hours
was 1.9 nmol/L. The same cell line was seeded in a 96-well
plate, in suspension or in collagen, and cell viability was
measured using the ATP-based assay CellTiter-Glo (Fig. 2C).
The Pearson test produced r values of 0.8905 and 0.8704
(P values 0.003 and 0.0049) for the correlation between the
model and suspension, and collagen results, respectively.
Quantiﬁcation of melphalan innate resistance in cell
lines in single culture
The melphalan sensitive and resistant cell lines NCI-H929
and 8226/LR5 were exposed to stable gradients of melphalan
for 24 hours (highest concentrations of 50 and 100 mmol/L,
respectively) and chemosensitivity was quantiﬁed. The analysis of 8226/LR5 detected a subpopulation of sensitive cells

(30%; Fig 3A), indicating that this cell line is actually heterogeneous, a possible explanation for the loss of resistance
commonly observed when these cells are maintained in melphalan-free medium for many weeks (24). Melphalan concentration that induced 50% of death in cells (EC50) for 24 hours
continuous exposure was 50 mmol/L for 8226/LR5 and 12
mmol/L for H929. Long-term exposure to lower, more physiological doses (10–20 mmol/L) of melphalan, however, indicated that, although all melphalan had been hydrolyzed in the
ﬁrst 24 hours in media, cell death continued to occur after 6
days of drug exposure (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Quantiﬁcation environment-mediated melphalan
resistance
Cell adhesion–mediated drug resistance is believed to be a
major cause of minimal residual disease in multiple myeloma
(18). This mechanism is caused by direct multiple myeloma–
stroma cell adhesion, by paracrine loops of soluble factor
secretion, or by multiple myeloma–extracellular matrix adhesion. To quantify the importance of multiple myeloma–stroma
adhesion under physiological conditions (high density, in
presence of ECM), the multiple myeloma cell line NCI-H929
was cocultured with the bone marrow–derived stromal cell

line HS-5/GFP. A signiﬁcant shift toward resistance was
observed at later time points (24 hours) and was most
expressive around the concentration of 20 to 30 mmol/L (Fig. 4).
Continuous versus pulsed exposure to drugs
To exemplify the study of continuous versus pulsed exposure to drugs, 2 chambers with NCI-H929 cells were exposed to
bortezomib for 24 hours. In one, the medium was replaced by
drug-free medium, whereas in the other fresh medium with
bortezomib was added. Being a reversible proteasome inhibitor, the results suggest that bortezomib-induced death stops
upon drug withdrawal (Supplementary Fig. S4), unlike melphalan (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Melphalan chemosensitivity of primary multiple
myeloma cells in single and coculture
From the 17 patient samples obtained so far in this protocol,
the ﬁrst 10 were used for development and optimization of the
platform. The results of the 7 others are described here. We
have exposed CD138þ-sorted primary multiple myeloma cells
from patient 14, a newly diagnosed patient, for 48 hours to a
stable gradient of 25 mmol/L melphalan in single and coculture,
with patient-derived stroma. As shown in Fig. 5, adhesion to

www.aacrjournals.org

stroma signiﬁcantly increased the survival of multiple myeloma cells, shifting the 48 hours EC50 from 2 mmol/L in single
culture to 12 mmol/L in coculture. This effect could be circumvented by combination of a proteasome inhibitor at
sublethal levels (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Video S1; ref. 25).
Melphalan and bortezomib chemosensitivity among
patients with multiple myeloma
Supplementary Fig. S5 depicts the in vitro chemosensitivity
of 3 patients with multiple myeloma to melphalan in single
culture: patient 14, patient 11 (smoldering myeloma), and
patient 12 (relapsed after bone marrow transplantation). The
EC50s at 24-hour exposure were 4 mmol/L for patients 14 and 12
and 1 mmol/L for patient 11. However, the percentage surviving
cells at 20 mmol/L, a more physiological concentration of highdose melphalan treatment, was 30% for patient 12, 11% for
patient 14, and 4% for patient 11. Fig. 7 represents bortezomib
chemosensitivity of patients 11, 12, 13 (newly diagnosed), and
17 (smoldering myeloma). For patients 11 and 12, EC50 after 24
hours continuous exposure was below 2 nmol/L; however, at
higher concentrations, multiple myeloma cells from patient 11
were signiﬁcantly more resistant: 30% live cells at 50 nmol/L
bortezomib for patient 11 and 8% for patient 12. Twenty-

was not reached with the sample from patient 17.
Extrapolation of in vitro data into in vivo and clinical
response
By parameterizing equation C with values obtained from
ﬁtting equation A to the in vitro dose–response data, it is
possible to simulate how a tumor mass would respond to a
therapeutic regimen. As an example, the subcutaneous mouse
model severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID), when
implanted with the cell line NCI-H929, develops a tumor that
grows 45-fold in 20 days (26). When treated with 1 mg/kg
bortezomib twice a week, the tumor growth is reduced, and
tumors are 20-fold bigger at day 20 than at implantation (27).
From the bortezomib in vitro chemosensitivity assay with the
cell line NCI-H929 (Fig. 2), the parameters from equation C
were: IC50Rx ¼ 10.35 nmol/L, IC50DT ¼ 10.38 hours, exp Rx ¼ 2.7,
and exp T ¼ 7.1. Supplementary Fig. 6 depicts the computational simulation of the tumor growth under control conditions, under a bi-weekly treatment with 1 mg/kg of bortezomib
(which leads to a stable blood concentration of 0.4 nmol/L;
ref. 28), and a hypothetical regimen where mice received a
pulsed therapy with the same AUC, with bi-weekly injections

64

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

of bortezomib every other week (therapy holidays). The
simulated tumor would have increased 53.4-fold in control
conditions (Pearson r ¼ 0.9762), 18-fold in standard bortezomib treatment (Pearson r ¼ 0.9869), and 5-fold in the
hypothetical pulsed regimen. The same approach was used
to simulate the response of patients 11, 12, 13, and 17 to a
single-agent regimen of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2; Supplementary Fig. 7). In this regimen, plasma concentration stabilizes
at 1 nmol/L (4), and according to simulations, would
achieve complete response in patients 11 an 12, relapse in
patient 17, and no response in patient 13.

Discussion
In this work, we have described an interdisciplinary platform
to study preclinical drug activity in primary multiple myeloma
cells. First, multiple myeloma cells are embedded in a microﬂuidic chamber that recapitulates the bone marrow microenvironment, including high-cell density, extracellular matrix,
and patient-derived stromal cells. A linear and stable drug
gradient is established across the chamber, which is then
imaged sequentially in bright ﬁeld. A digital image analysis
algorithm detects live multiple myeloma cells by the motion
of cell membrane: upon death this activity ceases. The

Multiple myeloma cells were sorted (CD138 ) from bone marrow aspirate and seeded into microﬂuidic chamber in single (SCX, 0 hour) or coculture

48 hours, almost all multiple myeloma cells are dead in single culture (SCX, 48 hours), whereas a signiﬁcant number of multiple myeloma cells are still alive in
coculture with stroma (CoCx, 48 hours). A, dose–response surfaces built using measurements of viability in single (SCX) and coculture (CoCx). B and C,

measurements of viability, at different concentrations and
time points, are ﬁt to mathematical models of chemosensitivity. These models can represent one or multiple subpopulations, and can be empirical or mechanistic. The data from these

experiments can thus be used to parameterize mathematical
models to simulate clinical outcome.
This platform overcomes some major limitations of preclinical assays using primary cancer cells. It has long been known

that extracellular matrix and stroma are major components of
chemoresistance in many tumors. However, the inclusion of
these elements signiﬁcantly increases the complexity of dose–
response assays, often requiring the separation between cancer
and stromal cells, by matrix digestion and/or ﬂow sorting (29).
Also, viability assays are often destructive or cytotoxic, if
carried for long periods of time, limiting the information
acquired in the temporal dimension. In the here described
assay, multiple myeloma cells, stroma, and matrix are never
separated, and no cytotoxic agents are used to determine cell
viability, thus allowing longitudinal studies of drug activity
without interfering with the microenvironment.
In cancers such as multiple myeloma, where a few million
cells are obtainable per patient biopsy, it is important to
minimize the number of cells per experimental condition,
which is in the order of 1,000 to 10,000 cells in this assay. The
poor clonal efﬁciency of multiple myeloma cells, as well as their
spontaneous death in vitro (6), suggest that experiments with
these samples be performed in the ﬁrst few days after the
biopsy. By studying the effect of long-term exposure and drug
withdrawal in human multiple myeloma cell lines, we have
created mechanistic theoretical models of the drug activity (2).
Once a model is generated for a particular drug, the data from
patient samples are used to parameterize and extrapolate the
response for longer periods of time.
As shown for bortezomib-induced melphalan sensitization
in coculture (Fig. 6), this system can be used to study drug
interactions (30). The addition of the time dimension, instead
of ﬁxed time points, would allow the study of time-shifted drug
combinations, such as, for instance, nuclear export agents and
doxorubicin (31). Combination indices (30) may be obtained by
adding the 2 drugs being studied on the same reservoir, which
will induce 2 superimposed drug gradients.
This assay allows the observation of individual cells. Thus, it
is possible to assess the heterogeneity of drug–response by
plotting in a histogram the AUC at the moment of death of each

66

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

individual cell. Further improvements in the digital image
analysis algorithm could identify and track individual cells
from their original replication until their death. By combining
this information with the dose–response surfaces, it would be
possible to determine if particular drugs and concentrations
are capable of maintaining a tumor burden quiescent, or in a
balance between proliferation and death (32, 33).
These preliminary results describe a framework to better
understand the dynamics of interactions between tumor and
stroma in response to therapeutic agents in vitro. These assays
can be performed in a middle- to high-throughput manner, and
signiﬁcantly reduce the complexity of working with patient
primary cells in reconstructions of the tumor microenvironment. Ultimately, this may become a platform for personalized
preclinical estimation of drug efﬁcacy in cancer.
Future directions are to standardize methods to extrapolate
in vitro predictions into clinical outcome. We will also explore
the application of alternative therapeutic regimens of drug
combinations, proposed by data extrapolated from this in vitro
system, and simulated using evolutionary computational models (34, 35). We hypothesize that, patient-speciﬁc computational
models, parameterized by in vitro platforms as the here
described, could be combined with genomic (36) datasets to
better understand the dynamics that underlie evolution of drug
resistance in patients with multiple myeloma. Understanding
these dynamics would not only allow accurate predictions of
response, but also suggest the best therapeutic strategies for
each patient, and continue adjusting these strategies as needed.
