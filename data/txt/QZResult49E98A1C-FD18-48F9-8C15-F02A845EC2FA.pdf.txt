ABSTRACT
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNA molecules that regulate
gene expression at post-transcriptional level. Increasing evidences show aberrant
expression of miRNAs in varieties of diseases. Targeting the dysregulated miRNAs
with small molecule drugs has become a novel therapy for many human diseases,
especially cancer. Here, we proposed a novel computational approach to identify
associations between small molecules and miRNAs based on functional similarity of
differentially expressed genes. At the significance level of p < 0.01, we constructed
the small molecule and miRNA functional similarity network involving 111 small
molecules and 20 miRNAs. Moreover, we also predicted associations between drugs
and diseases through integrating our identified small molecule-miRNA associations
with experimentally validated disease related miRNAs. As a result, we identified 2265
associations between FDA approved drugs and diseases, in which ~35% associations
have been validated by comprehensive literature reviews. For breast cancer, we
identified 19 potential drugs, in which 12 drugs were supported by previous studies.
In addition, we performed survival analysis for the patients from TCGA and GEO
database, which indicated that the associated miRNAs of 4 drugs might be good
prognosis markers in breast cancer. Collectively, this study proposed a novel approach
to predict small molecule and miRNA associations based on functional similarity,
which may pave a new way for miRNA-targeted therapy and drug repositioning.

to develop miRNA specific drugs [7]. For example,
SPC3649 (a kind of locked nucleic acid) is the first
miRNA-targeted drug in clinical trials to inhibit miR-122
expression that is required by hepatitis C virus replication
[8]. However, the major hurdles in oligonucleotidesbased therapy are the properties of inefficient delivery
and suboptimal pharmacodynamics or pharmacokinetics,
which urgently need for small molecule-based
intervention strategies [9]. Small molecules maybe
suitable agents to regulate miRNA expression, because
they are less expensive to produce, easily diffuse across
cell membranes, easily delivered into cells as well as
having good solubility, bioavailability, and metabolic
stability [10]. For example, Bose et al. have identified the
small molecule streptomycin, which is widely used for
treatment of tuberculosis, as an inhibitor of miR-21 with

INTRODUCTION
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small singlestranded non-coding RNA molecules which regulate
gene expression by inducting cleavage or inhibiting
translation of target mRNAs [1]. These small non-coding
RNAs play crucial roles in many biological processes,
such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis, and
are related to varieties of disorders [1, 2]. Modulation
of aberrantly expressed miRNAs has been demonstrated
as a feasible strategy for many diseases [3]. At present,
many kinds of miRNA modulators have been used
in preclinical and clinical studies, such as antisense
oligonucleotides (also known as anti-miRs), miRNA
sponges, miRNA mimics [4–6]. Therefore, targeting
dysregulated miRNA is a potential therapeutic regimen

a potential cancer therapeutic. Moreover, streptomycin
could decrease miR-21 expression without affecting the
expression levels of other related miRNAs [11].
Currently, a wide number of studies have devoted
to develop high-throughput methods to screen small
molecule modifiers of miRNAs, which may provide a new
direction for miRNA-targeting therapies [4, 12–14]. Zhang
et al. have presented the structure-based approaches, such
as molecular docking, to screen compounds that targeting
miRNAs [10]. In another structure-based method, Bose
et al. reported a novel fluorescent molecular-beaconbased high-throughput method to screen small molecules
which inhibited miRNA expression by blocking the Dicer
processing [4]. Besides the structure based method, Jiang et
al. proposed a novel method to construct small moleculemiRNA networks for 23 different cancers based on the
similarity of transcriptional responses [15]. Similar work
has also been done for Alzheimer’s disease [16]. However,
since lack of miRNA-transfected datasets, we simulated
the transcriptional responses of miRNA perturbation
through intersecting target genes and differential expressed
genes of specific disease. Along with the growth of
miRNA transfection experiments, it is possible to regard
the effects of the miRNA on gene expression at whole
genome level, which more directly reflects alteration of
gene expression affected by the perturbed miRNA. What’s
more, miREnvironment and SM2miR database have
been constructed to collect the experimentally supported
associations between small molecules and miRNAs [17,
18], Currently, miREnvironment database have collected

complex interactions (3857 entries) among 1242 miRNAs,
305 phenotypes and 394 environment factors (including a
few small molecules). SM2miR database have collected
the 5160 records between 255 small molecules and
1680 miRNAs, and provided the effects (up-regulated
and down-regulated) of small molecules on miRNA
expression, and integrated all associations between drugs
and miRNAs in miREnvironment database.
In this study, we proposed a novel approach to
predict potential associations between small molecules and
miRNAs based on functional similarity of differentially
expressed genes of drug treatment and miRNA
perturbation. In addition, through integrating the identified
small molecule-miRNA associations with curated disease
related miRNAs, we predicted drug-disease associations,
which were used for drug repositioning. Finally, the
miRNAs related to several predicted potential breast
cancer drugs had the ability to distinguish patients with
good or poor prognosis (the workflow diagram was
shown in Figure 1). In a word, our method provides a
novel prospect for developing miRNA-targeted drugs and
predicting drug repositioning.

gene expression profiles under perturbation of 88 miRNAs
and treatment of 1309 bioactive small molecules. Second,
we identified differentially expressed genes for small
molecules and miRNAs. Then, we calculated functional
similarity based on Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment
analysis of the differentially expressed genes for each pair
of small molecule and miRNA. As a result, we obtained
the functional annotations of 1293 small molecules and 70
miRNAs (details in materials and methods). Here, similarity
scores followed an approximate normal distribution with
mean and standard deviation equaling to 0.4882 and 0.0965,
respectively (Figure 2). The threshold of similarity score
was determined by the value of the normal distribution at
the significance level of 0.01, which was 0.7127. Finally,
we constructed the small molecule-miRNA functional
similarity network (538 associations) under the threshold
of similarity score (0.7127), including 111 small molecules
and 20 miRNAs (Figure 3, details in Supplementary Table
S1). Especially, all 20 miRNAs in our predicted associations
have been proved to play important roles in cancer, which
were supported by previous studies. Taking miR-21 as
an example, miR-21 is an oncogenic miRNA which is
overexpressed in several tumors including breast cancer
[19]. When suppressing the expression of miR-21 in breast
cancer cells, cancer cells significantly reduced invasion and
metastasis [20]. Its associated small molecule Tretinoin (the
similarity score is 0.745) is also known as all-trans-retinoic
acid, which is an important regulator of cell reproduction,
proliferation and differentiation. In addition, Tretinoin is
usually used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia [21] and
has been demonstrated to have potential therapeutic action

in breast cancer [22]. Therefore, miR-21 may be a potential
target for Tretinoin in the treatment of breast cancer.
Next, we explored the topological properties of this
similarity network. As shown in Supplementary Figure
S1a, most small molecules (~40%) connected with a small
number of miRNAs (less than 20%). In Supplementary
Figure S1b, most miRNAs (50%) connected with a small
number of small molecules (less than 20%).
Furthermore, we determined the characteristics of
small molecule pairs connecting with the same miRNA or
miRNA pairs connecting with the same small molecule.
First, we computed the Meet/Min score for each pair of
miRNAs to evaluate the extent of shared target genes
[15, 16]. The Meet/min score between two miRNAs was
defined as the number of common target genes of two
miRNAs divided by the small number of target genes of
the two miRNAs. Our result showed that miRNA pairs
connected with the same small molecule had moderate
target similarity (p = 0.1892). Second, we employed the
two-dimensional Tanimoto chemical similarity score,
which was measured by Small Molecule Subgraph
Detector (SMSD) software [23], to evaluate the structural
similarity between small molecules. The findings indicated
that the small molecule pairs connecting with the same
miRNA had moderate structure similarity (p = 0.1223). All
above results were consistent with the previous study [24].
In addition, we further checked the potential
relationship between functional similarity and the number
of common targets of small molecule-miRNA pairs. We
collected FDA approved drugs and their target information
from the DrugBank database (http://www.drugbank.ca/),

Figure 2: The distribution of functional similarity scores. The similarity scores followed an approximate normal distribution
with the mean and standard deviation equaling 0.4882 and 0.0965. The cutoff was determined by the value of the normal distribution at the
significance level of 0.01, which was 0.7127.

which included 624 small molecule drugs and 378 drug
targets intersected with our dataset [21]. Meanwhile,
we obtained the experimentally validated miRNA target
genes from miRecords (Release 4.0) [25], miRTarBase
(Release 4.5) [26], and TarBase (Release 6.0) [27].
Through integrating these regulations, we finally got
16510 miRNA-target gene pairs for 70 miRNAs in our
study. For each association between FDA approved small
molecule drug and miRNA, we counted the common target
genes and compared with the similarity scores of these
associations (Figure 4). The results demonstrated that the
association with the higher similarity score tended to have
the larger number of common target genes (Spearman’s
rank correlation r = 1, p = 0.017).

were considered as gold standard set. For each association
in the gold standard set, we randomly selected the same
number of GO terms of the miRNA and recalculated the
similarity between the randomly GO terms and the GO
terms of small molecule. This procedure was repeated 99
times and produced 99 fake functional similarity scores for
each association. Considering the associations in the gold
standard set as the positive instances and fake associations
as negative instances, we calculated the sensitivity and
the specificity of our approach at different cutoffs and
plotted ROC curve (Figure 5). The area under roc curve
(AUC) was 0.985, which suggested that the gold standard
set indeed ranked on the higher position among 11000
pairs (110 true associations and 10890 fake associations).
This result indicated that our approach achieved good
performance in prediction of associations between small
molecules and miRNAs.

Evaluation of the identified associations between
small molecules and miRNAs
The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
was employed to evaluate the performance of our approach
base on the known small molecule-miRNA associations
from SM2miR database (http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/
SM2miR/). First, we obtained 110 associations between
small molecules and miRNAs in SM2miR database,
which also appeared in this study. The 110 associations

[29] databases. Then, we integrated these two databases
and obtained 8134 associations between miRNAs and
diseases in total. All redundant associations were removed
via converting the similar disease names into MeSH
unique IDs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh). For
the 20 miRNAs in the identified small molecule-miRNA
functional similarity network, we obtained 506 miRNAdisease associations, involving 192 diseases. Combining
the predicted 538 small molecule-miRNA associations
in this study, we identified statistically significant small
molecules-diseases pairs based on shared miRNAs by
hypergeometric test. At the cutoff of adjusted p-value
(FDR) < 0.1, 2265 pairs between 50 FDA-approved drugs
and 155 diseases were identified. Among them, in 53

pairs, the drugs have already been used for treatment of
the corresponding disorders, and ~35% (779/2265) pairs,
involving 43 FDA-approved drugs and 128 diseases,
have been supported by in vitro or in vivo experiments
in previous studies. For example, the association of
acetylsalicylic acid and colorectal cancer was significant in
our prediction (p=0.006, FDR=0.061). Acetylsalicylic acid
(also known as aspirin) is a common drug for treatment
of mild to moderate pain and clinically indicated in the
treatment of others disorder, such as arterial and venous
thrombosis [21]. The effectiveness of Acetylsalicylic
acid in regulating growth and differentiation of cancer,
such as colorectal cancer, has also been reported in vitro
and in vivo experiments [30–33]. Thus, the predicted

expression was quantified using Agilent Human miRNA
Microarray 2.0. For each small molecule drug, we firstly
extracted expressions of miRNAs associated with this
small molecule. And then, we classified all patients into
two groups using K-means cluster method (K=2) based on
these miRNAs expression.
Finally, we discovered that 19 and 4 small moleculerelated miRNAs could classify the breast cancer patients
into high-risk and low-risk groups significantly (logrank test p-value < 0.05) in TCGA and GEO datasets,
respectively (Figure 6 and Supplementary Figure S2). The
four small molecule drugs were marked red in Table 1. It
was observed that miR-200c had associated with all of the
four small molecules and tended to up-regulated in good
prognosis groups. Analogously, we also found that miR26a was related to two of the four small molecule drugs
and tended to be up-regulated in good prognosis groups
(Table 2). In breast cancer, miR-200c and miR-26a have
been proved to be aberrantly expressed [34–37]. MiR200c, the predominant member of the miR-200 family,
could inhibit migration, invasion and cell polarization
cancer-related processes [36]. MiR-26a has been reported

In TCGA database, we obtained 465 breast cancer

gene expression profiles from GEO database. In previous
studies, because of lacking the miRNA transfection
datasets, we simulated the dysregulated genes of miRNA
perturbation through intersecting miRNA’s target genes and
differentially expressed genes of one disease. Along with
the miRNA transfection datasets, the effects of the miRNA
on gene expression at the whole genome level more
directly reflect the alteration of gene expression affected
by miRNA. Meanwhile, we obtained the small molecule
perturbed gene expression profiles from the Connectivity
Map (cMap, build 02) database [38]. These expression

profiles reflect the transcription response to small molecules
rather than the ‘putative target’ that the small molecule
can be modulating. Based on the transcription responses
perturbed by small molecule, some research focusing on
broader themes of mechanism of action (MoA) elucidation
[39, 40], drug repositioning [41, 42] and biological
understanding [43, 44] have been performed. Moreover,
we selected the transcription profiles of cell lines treated
by small molecules and miRNAs to screen the perturbed
genes. The functional similarity score for each pair of small
molecule and miRNA was finally calculated based on the
GO annotations of their perturbed genes.
Consequently, we identified 538 associations between
111 small molecules and 20 miRNAs. What’s more, we
obtained the curated small molecule-miRNA associations
from SM2miR database as gold standard set to evaluate
the performance of our approach. As a result, the AUC was
0.985. Furthermore, we identified small molecule-disease
associations based on shared miRNAs, which provided a
new way to predict the potential drug indications. Finally,
survival analysis based on expression of miRNAs related to
small molecule drugs for breast cancer revealed that these
miRNAs might be good prognosis markers.
Some studies have devoted to predict the
associations between small molecules and miRNAs. For
example, Chen et al. predicted novel disease-related
interactions between environmental factors (such as drugs)
and miRNAs through a semi-supervised classifier based
method [45]. Meng et al. proposed a novel method to
predicted candidate small molecule-miRNA associations
based on the similarity of transcription responses [46]. In
this study, our approach tended to identify relationships
between small molecules and miRNAs based on functional
associations. Comparing with the transcription responses,
functions were usually more reproducible.
In conclusion, we presented an approach to identify
associations between small molecules and miRNAs based
on functional similarities, which might provide a valuable
perspective for repurposing drugs and predicting novel
drug targets.

For single channel gene expression profiles with
greater than or equal to two samples in each sample class
(“transfection” or “control”), we applied significance
analysis of microarray (SAM) [47] to identify significantly
differentially expressed genes (FDR<=0.05). Otherwise,
we identified the differentially expressed genes by 2-fold
change method. For double channel gene expression
profiles, 2-fold change was also used to measure the extent
of differential expression of probes in each sample. Then,
the conflict genes (gene appeared both in up-regulated and
in down-regulated sets) were discarded. Only genes that
were up-regulated or down-regulated in more than half
samples were defined as differentially expressed genes.
Because some gene expression profiles measured
under the same miRNA perturbation, we should combine
the differentially expressed genes in these datasets. If the
genes were up-regulated or down-regulated consistently
in more than 2 datasets, the genes were considered
differentially expressed under the miRNA perturbation.

Gene expression profiles under small molecule
treatment
We collected the small molecule perturbed gene
expression profiles from the cMap. The cMap contains
6100 gene expression profiles of 1309 bioactive small
molecules treatment and the corresponding controls. The
differential expression was measured by amplitude (A),
which was defined as:
t−c
A=
1
(t + c )
2
where t is the expression value of the probe in treatment
group, c is the expression value in the control group.
We defined that the probes with more than 2-foldchange
between treatment and control group as the differentially
expressed probes. Namely, the A value more than 2/3
means up-regulation, while the A value less than -2/3
means down-regulation.
Several gene expression profiles were measured
under the treatment of the same small molecule, so we
should combine the differential expressed genes of the same
small molecule. Analogous to the differentially expressed
genes of miRNA, only genes that were up-regulated or
down-regulated in at least two expression profiles were
considered as the differentially expressed genes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene expression profiles under miRNA perturbation
We collected gene expression profiles from the
GEO database by keywords “miRNA transfection” or
“microRNA transfection”. We only reserved datasets with
both miRNA transfected samples and control samples.
We obtained 110 gene expression profiles of miRNA
mimics (mimic endogenous miRNAs) or inhibitors (inhibit
endogenous miRNAs) transfection in multiple species. We
only chose 92 miRNA perturbed gene expression profiles
(excluding gene expression profiles perturbed by multiple
miRNAs or edited miRNAs) in human for further analysis,
which involved 88 miRNAs (see Supplementary Table S2).

Functional enrichment analysis of small
molecules and miRNAs
For the differentially expressed genes of miRNA (or
small molecule), we implemented function enrichment
analysis by the R package GOSim [48]. The version of
GOSim package that we used in this study was 1.2.7.7.
Biological Process (BP) was selected as the annotation
category. Here, we chose the “elim” method, which improved
38665

the enrichment analysis via removing the genes mapped to
significant GO terms from all their ancestors and calculates
the significance of these GO terms using Fisher’s exact
test [49]. At the significance level of p< 0.01, we identified
functions of 1293 small molecules and 70 miRNAs.

total, we obtained 289469 miRNA regulations for 776
miRNAs.

Functional similarity between small molecule
and miRNA

In order to calculate structure similarity between
two small molecules, we download the SDF file from
Pubchem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/)
[65]. The small molecules without structure information
were filtered out. The two-dimension Tanimoto chemical
similarity score between small molecules was calculated
by the SMSD software.

Chemical structure similarity between two small
molecules

For each pair of small molecule and miRNA,
we calculated the functional similarity score based
on the annotated GO function. We implemented the
computational procedure of similarity analysis with the
R package GOSemSim [50]. The version of GOSemSim
that we used was 1.20.0. The GOSemSim presented five
methods, including Resnik [51], Jiang [52], Lin [53],
Schlicker [54]and Wang [55], to calculate the semantic
similarity of two given GO terms and four measures,
including max, avg, rcmax and BMA, to combine semantic
similarity scores of multiple GO terms. Here, we chose the
widely used “Lin” and “BMA” methods. “Lin” method
determined the semantic similarity of two given GO terms
based on the annotation information content (IC). The
IC of a GO term denoted that the negative logarithm of
probability of the term appearing in the GO corpus.
The probability of a given GO term t is defined as:
n
p (t ) = t
N
where nt is the number of its all children nodes plus itself,
and N is the total number of terms in GO corpus. The IC
is defined as:
IC ( t ) = −log( p(t ))

Survival analysis of breast cancer patients
In this study, we identified 19 potential small
molecule drugs for breast cancer, in which 12 drugs
have been validated by previous publication. Next,
we further investigated whether the miRNAs that
associated with the potential breast cancer drugs could
distinguish breast cancer patients with good or poor
outcome. Thus, we first collected breast cancer samples
with miRNA expression and clinical information from
TCGA and GEO database (GSE19783). As a result, we
obtained 465 and 99 breast cancer patients from these
two data resources, respectively. Then, we used the Kmeans cluster method (K=2) to cluster the patients into
two groups based on miRNA expression. Finally, we
used log-rank test to evaluate the statistical significant
of difference between the two groups, and drew the
Kaplan-Meier curve of the two different prognostic
groups with R package survival.

The Lin method is defined as:
2 IC ( MICA)
sim(t1, t 2 ) =
IC ( t1 ) + IC ( t 2 )

The targets of miRNAs
Previous studies indicated that a combination of
multiple algorithms might increase the reliable of miRNA
targets [56]. Thus, we obtained miRNA targets from seven
prediction algorithms as previous study [57], including
DIANA-microT [58], miRanda [59], RNA22 [60],
RNAhybrid [61], TargetScan [62], miRBase Targets [63]
and Pictar [64]. Only miRNA targets that were predicted
in at least two algorithms were considered as reliable. In
