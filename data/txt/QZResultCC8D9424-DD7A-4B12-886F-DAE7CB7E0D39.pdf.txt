Improves Chemotherapy Delivery to Tumors

Abstract
Antiangiogenic therapies are frequently used with concomitantly administered cancer chemotherapy to improve outcomes, but the mechanism for the benefit of the combination is uncertain. We describe a mechanism
by which a specific, cytotoxic antivascular agent causes vascular remodeling and improved chemotherapy
results. By selectively killing tumor neovasculature using short-ranged α-particles targeted to vascular
endothelial (VE)-cadherin on vascular endothelial cells (by use of 225Ac-labeled E4G10 antibody) we were
able both to reduce tumor growth and to increase the efficacy of chemotherapy, an effect seen only when
the chemotherapy was administered several days after the vascular targeting agent, but not if the order of
administration was reversed. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies showed that the vasculature of 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors was substantially depleted; the remaining vessels appeared more mature
morphologically and displayed increased pericyte density and coverage. Tumor uptake and microdistribution
studies with radioactive and fluorescent small molecule drugs showed better accumulation and more homogenous distribution of the drugs within 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors. These results show that 225Ac-E4G10
treatment leads to ablation and improvement of the tumor vascular architecture, and also show that the
resulting vascular remodeling can increase tumor delivery of small molecules, thus providing a process for
the improved outcomes observed after combining antivascular therapy and chemotherapy. This study directly
shows evidence for what has long been a speculated mechanism for antiangiogenic therapies. Moreover,
targeting the vessel for killing provides an alternative mode of improving chemotherapy delivery and efficacy,
potentially avoiding some of the drawbacks of targeting a highly redundant angiogenic pathway. Cancer Res;

Introduction
Therapies focusing on the tumor vasculature play an important part in the management of late-stage malignancies.
Several drugs that target the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway have been approved and are in clinical
use, whereas others are in different stages of clinical development. Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody, is routinely used
in combination with chemotherapy in the treatment for metastatic colon, non–small cell lung, and breast cancers. The
multi–tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and sunitinib,
which target, among others, the VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGFR2),
are approved as single agents in the treatment of renal cell

carcinomas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and hepatocellular carcinomas. As tumor angiogenesis is a process necessary for tumor growth, interference with VEGF signaling
could produce strategies that are broadly effective. Moreover,
because VEGF affects the host endothelium and not tumor
cells, development of resistance against these drugs should
be less likely. Unfortunately, in preclinical models and in several clinical trials with potent VEGF inhibitors, many tumors
failed to respond. Furthermore, even tumors initially responsive to anti-VEGF/VEGFR2 therapy finally acquire resistance
to the treatment, and relapse occurs in virtually all patients
(1–3). Thus, although antiangiogenic therapy has proven to
be a valuable tool in cancer treatment, there is a need for
alternative strategies to target the tumor vasculature; in addition, the mechanisms of action for antiangiogenic therapy
in combination with chemotherapy are poorly understood.
Vascular endothelial (VE) cadherin is an endothelial cell–
specific protein that is expressed constitutively throughout
the vasculature and participates in the formation of adherens
junctions between adjacent endothelial cells. The monoclonal antibody (mAb) E4G10 specifically binds to a cryptic epitope exposed only on the monomeric terminal domain of the
unengaged form of VE-cadherin, found in the neovasculature,
and not on the dimeric form, which is present in mature
endothelium (4). We looked to exploit this specificity to

investigate the effects of neovascular ablation in tumors by
conjugating E4G10 to Actinium-225, an α-particle–emitting
isotope generator. α-Particles exhibit high linear energy
transfer and deposit large amounts energy (5–8 meV) over
a pathlength of cellular dimensions (∼60–80 μm; ref. 5).
These properties confer α-particles with the potential to kill
individual cells with just one nuclear hit, thus reducing the
chance of developing resistance, while specifically destroying
targeted cells and limiting bystander cell toxicity (6).
We had previously reported the design and use of a neovascular VE-cadherin–targeted α-particle immunotherapeutic agent that was effective with paclitaxel chemotherapy in
a prostate cancer model when used in combination, similar
to the reported effects of antiangiogenic drugs (7, 8). Unlike
other antiangiogenic or antivascular strategies, 225Ac-E4G10
does not target a tumor-specific pathway that can be circumvented by other angiogenic pathways; rather, it directly
kills the new endothelial cells (7, 9). These properties make
225
Ac-E4G10–based therapies an interesting alternative to
other antiangiogenic or antivascular strategies. In addition,
the highly selective nature of the direct killing of the vessels,
due to the short range of the α-particle, allows us to isolate
the effects of the therapy on the tumor endothelial cells alone
without significant tumor cell killing.
The mechanism by which antiangiogenic therapies make
chemotherapy more effective remains controversial. One theory explaining the additive effects of antiangiogenic therapy
and chemotherapy is “vessel normalization”: morphologic
improvements and maturational changes are induced by
the therapy in residual tumor vessels, which are initially tortuous, dilated, leaky, and associated with erratic blood flow,
hypoxia, and increased interstitial pressure. Normalization of
the tumor vessels, with reduced interstitial pressure and hypoxia, would enhance delivery and efficacy of subsequent cytotoxic agents, such as chemotherapeutic drugs, explaining
improved outcomes observed in preclinical and clinical trials
(10, 11). However, there is little experimental evidence that
antiangiogenic therapy improves drug delivery, and alternative models have been suggested. For example, tumor cell repopulation, which would occur after chemotherapy ceases,
might be mitigated by angiogenesis inhibition during the
chemotherapy-free period (12, 13). Another mechanism,
which may be consistent with vessel normalization, suggests
that antivascular or VEGF-inhibition therapies may prevent
endothelial progenitor cells from infiltrating the tumor and
providing the vascular network necessary for further tumor
growth (9). Although the preclinical and clinical observations
strongly support treating cancers with antiangiogenic or
antivascular therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy regimens, optimization of their efficacy will require a better
understanding of why these combinations are additive (14).
Here, we report that treatment with 225Ac-E4G10 in a human colon cancer xenograft model results in reduced tumor
burden, tumor vasculature remodeling, and improved tumor
uptake of three different small molecule agents, as well as
enhanced therapeutic response to chemotherapy. These data
provide a rational pharmacokinetic mechanism to explain
the benefits of combining antivascular therapy with chemo-

therapy in a schedule-dependent manner, which is something that has long been speculated as the mechanism of
antiangiogenic agents but has yet to be shown directly.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Female athymic nude mice (NCr nu/nu), 4 to 12 weeks of
age, were obtained from Taconic. Animal studies were conducted according to the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals and were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center (MSKCC).
Preparation, quality control, and administration of
radioimmunoconjugates
225
Actinium (Oak Ridge National Laboratory or Curative,
Inc.) was conjugated to E4G10 using a two-step labeling
method as described (8). Routine quality control of the labeled antibody was performed using instant thin-layer chromatography to estimate radiopurity, and cell binding assays
were done to determine immunoreactivity. Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane and injected i.v. (in retro-orbital venous
plexus) with the radioimmunoconjugate. The injected volume
was 100 μL and the antibody dose was 0.3 to 0.5 μg per 60 nCi
injection. Typical radiochemical purity was 96% to 99%.
Tumor implantation in mice
LS174T cells were obtained from MSKCC stocks. Cells
were grown in DMEM supplemented with glucose, nonessential amino acids, L-glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum in an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and air at 37°C. Cells were harvested
and approximately 3 million cells were injected in 100 μL of
matrigel (BD Biosciences) into the right flank of each animal.
Tumor therapy studies
Randomized control therapy studies with 225Ac-E4G10.
Cohorts of 8 to 10 tumor-bearing animals were treated with
either saline, unlabeled E4G10 mAb (10 μg), or 225Ac-E4G10
mAb (60 nCi, ∼0.4 μg). Treatments were administered i.v. on
days 5, 7, and 9 postimplantation with 3 million LS174T cells;
however, unlabeled E4G10 (10 μg) was given as a single bolus
dose administered at day 5 post–tumor implantation. In
other studies, 225Ac-E4G10–treated animals were compared
with 225Ac-IgG2a isotype control. Tumor size was measured
with calipers, and tumor volume was calculated by the formula 0.52 × d12 × d2, where d1 is the smaller diameter and d2
is the larger diameter. Day 5 postimplantation of tumor was
selected as the first day of treatment because it is the day
during which new vessels first clearly appear, as determined
in previous histologic studies. Mice were sacrificed when
tumor size was >2,500 mm3.
Controlled, drug sequence trials. Mice were implanted
with 3 million LS174T cells on day 0. Each cohort of 8 to
10 mice then received two different treatments in a specified
sequence. Saline, chemotherapy [1.8 mg leucovorin (Teva
Parenteral Medicines) + 0.6 mg 5-fluorouracil (FU; Abraxis
Pharmaceutical Products), i.p.], or 225 Ac-labeled E4G10

Neovasculature Killing Improves Tumor Drug Delivery

(60 nCi, on ∼0.5 μg antibody, i.v.) was administered at days 5,
7, and 9 (first round of therapy), and at days 15, 17, and 19
(second round of therapy) post–tumor implantation as indicated in the groups. Because this model system was designed
specifically to look at the effects of the drugs on the neovasculature, not necessarily to achieve the maximum tolerated
effects on tumor growth, doses were selected to cause ∼50%
reduction in tumor growth rate relative to saline treatment
as determined in pilot experiments to allow differentiation
between effects of the first round of treatments from the second. Three distinct treatment groups were randomized to:
(a) saline followed by saline, (b) leucovorin/FU followed by
225
Ac-E4G10, and (c) 225Ac-E4G10 followed by leucovorin/
FU. Tumor dimensions were measured and tumor volume
was calculated. Animals were followed for up to 111 days
post–tumor implantation for survival (statistics determined
with log-rank/Mantel-Cox test).
Histopathologic studies
A fraction of the mice (n = 3 per group) from the aforementioned treatment groups were sacrificed at day 15 postimplantation of tumor, and tumors were either cryofixed
(OCT Tissue-Tek, SAKURA Finetek U.S.A. Inc) or fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for histopathologic study. Vascular density was determined in tissue
sections stained for Pan ECA (pan endothelial cell antigen,
Ab-Clone Meca 32, Dako); immunofluorescent staining for
collagen IV, a major component of vascular basement membrane, assessed the basement membrane of vessels and
helped differentiate between vascular ablation and inhibition
of angiogenesis; staining for both α-smooth muscle actin
(α-SMA) and neuron-glia antigen 2 (NG2), both markers of
pericytes, was performed to quantitate pericyte density and
coverage of tumor vasculature. All quantification was done
after scanning whole stained tumor sections, three per sample. Epifluorescence or bright field scanning was performed
on a Zeiss Mirax Scan system using a 40× lens (Carl Zeiss
Microimaging). Positive stained areas in the obtained highresolution images were quantified using ImageJ (http://
rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Quantification results were analyzed with
Prism software (Version 5.0, GraphPad software) for statistical
significance using t-test (unpaired, two-tailed). In addition,
two-dimensional and three-dimensional images were acquired
by laser confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2, Leica Microsystems) or bright field microscopy (Zeiss Axiovert 200M) of selected
fields from the same sections to illustrate quantification results.
Preparation of 111In-DTPA
Vascular penetration and drug diffusion into tumors was
assessed using the radiolabeled construct 111In-DTPA, which
was prepared by adding a mixture of 1.01 mCi of acidic 111In
chloride (MDS Nordion) and 3M ammonium acetate (Aldrich)
in 0.020 mL to 0.080 mL of a 50 mmol/L solution of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) solution at 20°C for
60 minutes, and was tested for purity by instant thin-layer
chromatography (Gelman Science Inc.); it was mixed with 1%
human serum albumin (Swiss Red Cross) and 0.9% NaCl
(Abbott Laboratories) to achieve 0.097 Ci/L the day of injection.

Biodistribution, permeability, and accumulation of
small molecules into tumors
Tumor-bearing animals (n = 8 per group) were anesthetized with isofluorane and injected with 111In-DTPA (5 μCi)
retro-orbitally and sacrificed after 5 minutes or 60 minutes to
evaluate 111In-DTPA vascular space and tissue space, respectively. Animals were also injected with Hoechst 33342 dye for
high-resolution fluorescence perfusion studies 20 minutes
prior to sacrifice. The percent injected dose per gram of
indium-111 in tissues was determined after sacrifice and analyzed with Prism software (Version 5.0, GraphPad software)
for statistical significance using t-test (unpaired, two-tailed).
Autoradiography
Tumor samples from mice injected (n = 6 per group)
with 111In-DTPA 60 minutes earlier were collected, cryofixed
(OCT Tissue-Tek, SAKURA Finetek U.S.A. Inc.), and cut with
a cryostatic microtome (HM 500 M, Microm GmbH) to
30-μm sections. After air drying, the slide-mounted sections
were covered with a sheet of 5-μm-thick mylar and pressed
against a phosphor screen (type BI) in a light-tight cassette
and the screen was exposed for 3 days. The screen was
then scanned in a Molecular Imager System (model GS-363,
Bio-Rad Laboratories) using a laser scanner at a spatial
resolution of 100 μm. For image analysis, ImageJ was used
to convert grayscale images into 8-bit binary images and
the number of positive pixels per mm2 was determined.
Statistical analyses
Graphs were constructed using Prism (Graphpad Software
Inc.). Statistical comparisons between the experimental
groups were by Student's t-test (unpaired, two-tailed), or
log-rank/Mantel-Cox test depending on the analysis.

Results
Pretreatment with 225Ac-E4G10 enhances subsequent
chemotherapy effects
The LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma xenograft model
was selected because it has been extensively used to investigate therapeutic effects on the tumor vasculature (15–18).
Based on earlier pilot studies, the treatment dose of 225AcE4G10 was chosen to cause ∼50% reduction in tumor size
(from saline treatment) and allow us to determine the effects
of subsequent treatments. LS174T-engrafted mice treated
with 225Ac-E4G10 (60 nCi, ∼0.5 μg/mice/dose on days 5, 7,
and 9) showed significant reduction of tumor growth compared with saline, unlabeled E4G10 (10 μg), and, in a separate
experiment, 225Ac-IgG2a (isotype control mAb; Fig. 1A and B).
This indicated that the antitumor effect was caused by directed α-particle damage to VE-cadherin–positive endothelium
and not by binding of the unlabeled antibody alone to VEcadherin or by a nonspecific effect of the α-radiation within
the vessel lumen or in extravascular tissues (19). The standard
management of colorectal cancers includes regimens based
on FU, a thymidylate synthase inhibitor, and coadministration
of leucovorin. As with 225Ac-E4G10, pilot experiments were
performed to determine leucovorin/FU dosage, which

(P = 0.01; day 15 bar graph, right). B, in a separate study, 225Ac-E4G10 was also shown to be effective in reducing tumor burden compared with

administration of either LV/FU or 225Ac-E4G10 suppressed tumor growth significantly (P < 0.05) starting at day 9. 225Ac-E4G10 treatment in the first round
significantly augmented secondary chemotherapy effect on tumor volume by day 24 (P = 0.017) when compared with the inverse treatment regimen
(LV/FU followed by 225Ac-E4G10). D, day 26 post–tumor implantation (P = 0.03). Error bars, ± SE. Starting n = 8–10 per group for all experiments. P values

suppresses tumor growth by 50% to ensure the effect of a second agent would be discernable (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Next, we studied the therapeutic efficacy of combining
225
Ac-E4G10 with the standard chemotherapy and specifically asked whether the sequence of administration of the two
drugs was important in outcome. First, LS174T-engrafted animals received saline, 225Ac-E4G10, or leucovorin/FU in on
days 5, 7, and 9 post–tumor implantation, after tumors were
fully established and vascularized. Mice that received active
treatments (225Ac-E4G10 or leucovorin/FU) showed similar
reduction of tumor growth when compared with salineinjected controls for the first 15 days following tumor implantation, as expected based on the dose selection of both
drugs (Fig. 1C). On days 15, 17, and 19 post–tumor implantation, the animals received a second round of treatment of
the other drug. Animals treated with saline in the first round

exhibited rapid tumor growth, and 4 of 9 animals reached the
survival end point (tumor volume >2,500 mm3) by day 15
(Fig. 1C). The remaining animals in this group were followed
to determine median survival, which was 22 days (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The rapidity with which animals in the
saline-only pretreatment group reached survival end points
precluded the study of the effect of an active agent only in
the second round for these animals.
Animals treated with chemotherapy in the first treatment
round followed by 225Ac-E4G10 exhibited continued tumor
growth and a median survival of about 26 days, which was
not significantly different from the saline control group
(P = 0.24). In contrast, animals first treated with 225Ac-E4G10
and then treated with chemotherapy showed little additional
tumor growth during this time period compared with the
inverse treatment (P = 0.03; Fig. 1C and D). Animals in the

group that received 225Ac-E4G10 followed by leucovorin/FU
regimens had a median survival of 41.5 days which
was significantly higher than leucovorin/FU followed by
225
Ac-E4G10 (P = 0.019, log-rank/Mantel-Cox test). These data
confirmed that the drug combination alone did not enhance
survival; rather, it was the sequence of administration that
was important for treatment efficacy. These results led to
the hypothesis that our antivascular therapy was specifically
affecting the efficacy of subsequent chemotherapy.

Ac-E4G10–treated tumors show normalized, less
abundant vessels and increased pericyte
number and density
To further understand the mechanism for the effects of
225
Ac-E4G10 pretreatment on the efficacy of subsequent

leucovorin/FU, we studied the morphologic changes in the
tumor vasculature caused by 225Ac-E4G10 on day 15 post–
tumor implantation, the day the second treatment round
was started. 225Ac-E4G10 showed significantly lower endothelial cell counts, as visualized by staining for Pan ECA
(pan endothelial cell antigen, Ab-Clone Meca 32), when compared with control and leucovorin/FU-treated tumors
(Fig. 2A–C). In addition, tumors treated with saline or chemotherapy showed collagen IV staining associated with endothelial cells; however, 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors showed
tube-shaped collagen IV structures similar to those observed
in the controls, which were not associated with endothelial
cells (Fig. 2D–F). These collagen IV ghost structures often were
still filled with blood cells and were indicative of a selective
endothelial killing by 225Ac-E4G10 (20). Quantification of tumor

membrane (red) and Meca32 (green), and 4′, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstain of vessels, show that vessels of 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors

sections showed significantly more collagen sleeves with
225
Ac-E4G10 treatment (Fig. 2G). Vessels of tumors treated
with 225Ac-E4G10 were not only less abundant, but also smaller, consistent with previous data (Fig. 2H). Additionally, tumor tissue staining with E4G10 mAb to probe for the
unengaged VE-cadherin on neovascular cells showed significantly less immunoreactivity in 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors
when compared with control (P = 0.01) and chemotherapytreated tumors (P < 0.01).
Quantification of pericytes by staining for α-SMA was performed on tumor samples. Marked pericyte staining was observed after tumors were treated with 225Ac-E4G10, whereas
controls showed very low pericyte abundance (Fig. 3A and B).
As endothelial cells were depleted (Fig. 3C) and pericyte
counts were increased, 225Ac-E4G10 treatment clearly results
in significantly more pericytes per vessel area (α-SMA versus
Meca32; Fig. 3D). Thus, pericytes may have infiltrated or
proliferated within tumors in the 225Ac-E4G10 group, and
remaining blood vessels were more often supported by pericytes when compared with controls (Fig. 3E). These experiments were repeated with the pericyte marker NG2, which is
selective for a broader subset of pericytes than α-SMA. Results with NG2 confirmed that 225Ac-E4G10 treatment not
only resulted in a selective depletion of immature blood vessels, which lacked pericyte coverage, leaving only mature
pericyte-covered vessels, but also promoted the recruitment
of pericytes (Fig. 3F).
Apoptosis, as measured by cleaved caspase 3 staining, was
also significantly higher in 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Hypoxia evaluated by staining for carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), which is upregulated by hypoxia
inducible factor-1 α (HIF-1-α), was not significantly affected
by our treatment (ref. 21; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Of note,
LS174T tumors exhibited a much higher level of CAIX
staining that other tumor sections we had previously
encountered (data not shown), and these results may be a
consequence of a high baseline hypoxia in control-treated
animals such that more minor perturbations in hypoxia with
225
Ac-E4G10, if any, would be masked.
Pretreatment with 225Ac-E4G10 enhances tumor
accumulation of 111In-DTPA, Hoechst 33342, and
[18F]-3′-fluoro-3′-deoxy-L-thymidine
Histologic evaluation clearly indicated more mature tumor
vasculature after treatment with 225Ac-E4G10. However, the
mechanism by which this effect leads to increased chemotherapy efficacy was unknown; therefore, we decided to test
if the vessel remodeling also resulted in an improved delivery
of small molecule drugs into the tumor. Biodistribution studies were performed using DTPA-chelated 111Indium, a freely
diffusible small molecule tracer (22). Sixty minutes after administration of 111In-DTPA, there was a significant (P = 0.01)
increase in total 111In accumulation (percent injected dose
per gram) in tumors treated with 225Ac-E4G10 (Fig. 4A). This effect was more apparent when tumor signal was normalized to
blood signal (Fig. 4B). Biodistribution studies performed 5 minutes after administration of 111In-DTPA showed no difference in
tumor accumulation between 225Ac-E4G10 and 225Ac-IgG2a iso-

type control (Supplementary Fig. S3A). 111In activity in other
organs was also assessed at both time points and no consistent
treatment-dependent changes in uptake were observed.
Autoradiograms of the mice examined 60 minutes postinjection showed more tumors with high activity in the 225AcE4G10 treatment group when compared with 225Ac-IgG2a
controls (Fig. 4C). To measure homogeneity of signal distribution, the percent positive areas per tumor were evaluated
and 5 of 6 (83%) of 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors had >50%
positive areas, whereas only 2 of 6 (33%) of animals treated
with 225Ac-IgG2a showed >50% positive area. We corroborated these results further by evaluating the distribution of another small molecule, Hoechst 33342, in 225Ac-E4G10–treated
and untreated tumors. Hoechst 33342, which is fluorescent
and can be detected after intercalation into DNA, was
injected i.v. into tumor-bearing animals 20 minutes prior to
euthanasia and tissue sections were scanned. Evaluation of
the fluorescence signal by epifluorescence or laser-assisted
confocal microscopy yields the in-tissue distribution and
serves as a marker of perfusion. The area percentage positive
for Hoechst 33342 significantly (P < 0.05) increased after
225
Ac-E4G10 treatment, and tumors also showed a more
homogenous perfusion (Fig. 4D).
We also evaluated tumor accumulation and penetration
in experimental groups using [18F]-3′-fluoro-3′-deoxy-Lthymidine (18FLT), a positron emission tomography radiotracer analog of FU for biodistribution studies. Ten days after
pretreatment with 225Ac-E4G10 started (day 15 post–tumor
implantation), the accumulation of 18FLT in the tumor tissue
was significantly enhanced when compared with 225Ac-IgG2a
isotype treatment (P < 0.003), suggesting a similar effect for
FU and explaining the increased efficacy of the treatment
(Supplementary Fig. S3B). Other tissues showed no consistent
differences in 18FLT uptake across treatments.

Discussion
We show that directed, vascular killing of tumor neovascular endothelium by use of short-range (∼60–80 μm)
cytotoxic α-particles is an effective treatment modality
that enhances subsequent chemotherapeutic efficacy. We
describe a mechanism whereby 225Ac-E4G10 induces vessel
remodeling and leads to improved penetration of subsequently administered small molecules. A number of studies
have shown the additive effects of antiangiogenic compounds and chemotherapy in preclinical and clinical trials;
however, the mechanisms to explain the results were unclear and controversial (10, 14). The data here suggest that
the order of administration of the two types of agents, antivasculature and antitumor, is critical to successful outcomes and may have an important impact on the design
of combination therapies for clinical trials.
Antiangiogenic agents, including anti-VEGF or anti-VEGFR
mAbs, have been studied extensively preclinically, and bevacizumab has been successful when combined with chemotherapy. One mechanism that explains the additive effects observed
with bevacizumab and chemotherapy is vascular normalization with remodeling caused by antiangiogenic therapy,

leading to improved drug accumulation. In mice, treatment
with DC101, an anti-VEGF receptor-2 mAb, increased pericyte
coverage, reduced microvessel density, reduced interstitial
pressure, and improved oxygenation, but these studies stopped
short of proving enhancement in drug accumulation (10).

effectively block VEGF derived from the implanted human tumor cells, it has been previously shown that host-derived VEGF
significantly contributes in a model-dependent manner to the
angiogenic process (24). Thus, although improved drug accumulation or uptake in tumors has been speculated as a mechanism
for antiangiogenic therapies, little direct pharmacokinetic
evidence for this phenomenon exists.
In contrast to antiangiogenic agents, 225Ac-E4G10 is a
cytotoxic, vascular-targeting agent that selectively binds
to the neovasculature of tumors, depleting the endothelial
cells within tumors, as well as their progenitors in the
blood and bone marrow, but not the tumor cells themselves (9). Endothelial progenitor cells have been shown
to play a role in vasculogenesis within tumors, and vascular depletion, as well as the antitumor effects observed in
our study, could be a result of specific killing of both endothelial cells within tumors and killing of endothelial progenitor cells. The relative contribution of the endothelial

9284

Cancer Res; 70(22) November 15, 2010

progenitor cell population is an interesting question for
future studies.
The specificity of E4G10 to the neovasculature allowed us to
isolate the effects of antivessel therapy from other antitumor
effects in our study, but may not, consequently, generalize to
all antiangiogenic therapies. However, like anti-VEGF therapies, 225Ac-E4G10 treatment also results in phenotypic vascular normalization without targeting a highly redundant
angiogenic pathway. Thus, 225Ac-E4G10 treatment has the
potential to avoid some of the pitfalls observed with classical
anti-VEGF pathway therapeutic drugs. However, further experiments are necessary to determine whether 225Ac-E4G10
treatment might be a second-line alternative for anti-VEGF–
resistant tumors.
Unlabeled E4G10 at >4,000 times the dose of 225Ac-E4G10
used here has some antitumor effect, but it did not at 10 times
the dose we used (shown in control groups; ref. 19). In addition, α-emitters on nonspecific mAb were ineffective. These

Neovasculature Killing Improves Tumor Drug Delivery

data show that 225Ac-E4G10 was not operating by binding to,
or blocking, VE-cadherin, but by delivering the α-emitter selectively to kill the targeted endothelial cells.
The importance of sequence of administration was evident
when animals treated first with 225Ac-E4G10 and then with
leucovorin/FU chemotherapy exhibited both decreased tumor burden and improved median survival as compared with
animals receiving the inverse drug schedule. Histologic examination of 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors showed smaller,
less densely dispersed vessels. Additionally, vascular basement membrane (collagen IV) structures were present in
the absence of endothelial cells with 225Ac-E4G10 treatment,
whereas control and chemotherapy-treated tumors showed
endothelial cells adjacent to the collagen scaffold, confirming
that our treatment ablates endothelial cells (20). These collagen IV structures have been implicated in the tumor revascularization that occurs once antiangiogenic therapy is
ceased by serving as a scaffold for the neoendothelium
(25). Apoptosis was also higher in 225Ac-E4G10–treated tumors, which could be a combination of endothelial cell
death, tumor cell death as a consequence of endothelial cell
death, or direct tumor cell killing, which might be expected
given that the α-particle path length is several cell diameters
(∼60-80 μm); the gross differences in tumor volume may be a
consequence tumor cell death resulting from any of these
phenomena.
Pericytes are known to contribute to the integrity of mature vessels, and when absent result in abnormal function
and leakiness (26). Morphologically, 225Ac-E4G10–treated
tumors showed significantly more pericytes surrounding
smaller, less dilated vessels and higher pericyte coverage
(pericytes per vessel) when compared with saline and
leucovorin/FU treatment. Interestingly, 225Ac-E4G10–treated
tumors showed a higher total number of pericytes adjacent
to vessels, suggesting proliferation of intratumoral pericytes
or recruitment of pericytes, rather than simply a product of
immature vessel ablation. These histologic results are consistent with what occurs during vascular normalization by
anti-VEGF therapy.
Previous studies showed that antiangiogenic therapies
have resulted in decreases in intratumor pressure, improved
vessel function with decreased vascular leakiness, yet
few have determined if there is improved penetration of
the chemotherapy into the tumor upon vessel normalization (10, 27, 28). Our findings show a novel and specific
method for achieving vessel improvements in tumors.
Furthermore, accumulation and homogeneity of tumor
distribution of 111 In-DTPA by ex vivo tissue harvest
and autoradiographic analysis, and of Hoechst 33342 dye
by immunofluoresence, were all improved in 225Ac-E4G10–
treated animals.
18
FLT also entered tumors more effectively as measured by
positron imaging and ex vivo tissue harvest in 225Ac-E4G10–
treated animals than control. As 18 FLT is metabolized
by intracellular thymidine kinase, the total signal in tumors after treatment could be an amalgam of increased accumulation
driven by 225Ac-E4G10–induced remodeling of tumor vasculature and increased metabolic activity in the tumors. If there is

www.aacrjournals.org

increased metabolic activity, this further supports the selectivity of 225Ac-E4G10 for the vessel and not the tumor.
Because our drug results in vascular remodeling, improved perfusion, and improved small molecule drug accumulation within tumors, one might expect 225Ac-E4G10 to
cause a decrease in hypoxia as well. However, hypoxia levels
of tumor sections by CAIX staining were not significantly
altered between treatments. Typically, we found LS174T
tumors to exhibit a much higher level of CAIX staining
(at least four times more) than tumor sections derived from
other cell lines that we had previously encountered (data
not shown), and CAIX staining results may be a consequence of a high hypoxia baseline in these tumors such that
more minor perturbations in hypoxia with 225Ac-E4G10
would be masked if present. In addition, although antiangiogenic treatment with inhibitors of the VEGF pathway
is hypothesized to cause vascular normalization and at least
in one previously discussed setting improved drug uptake
(14), it is also frequently reported to actually increase hypoxia both in patients and in model systems (29–32). This
observation is often cited as a reason for the failure of these
therapies and development of resistance and a more aggressive phenotype (33, 34). Our findings combined with results
in the literature suggest that the effects of vascular changes
on oxygen and drug transport can sometimes be decoupled.
Given these differing data, it seems that our antivascular
approach mimics certain effects on the vasculature previously observed with antiangiogenic therapies, i.e., normalized vasculature and improved perfusion, while exhibiting
no detectable effects on hypoxia.
In conclusion, 225Ac-E4G10 treatment potently killed neovascular endothelial cells, remodeled tumor vasculature
without directly targeting an angiogenic signaling pathway,
and improved the pharmacokinetics of subsequently administered small molecules in tumors, thus providing a mechanism for the improved therapeutic efficacy of combinations
with chemotherapy. These observations also highlight the
importance of therapeutic scheduling when employing
agents targeting tumor vasculature.
