ABSTRACT
The anthraquinone emodin has been shown to have antineoplastic properties and
a wealth of unconnected effects have been linked to its use, most of which are likely
secondary outcomes of the drug treatment. The primary activity of emodin on cells has
remained unknown. In the present study we demonstrate dramatic and extensive effects
of emodin on the redox state of cells and on mitochondrial homeostasis, irrespectively of
the cell type and organism, ranging from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to human
cell lines and primary cells. Emodin binds to redox-active enzymes and its effectiveness
depends on the oxidative and respiratory status of cells. We show that cells with efficient
respiratory metabolism are less susceptible to emodin, whereas cells under glycolytic
metabolism are more vulnerable to the compound. Our findings indicate that emodin
acts in a similar way as known uncouplers of the mitochondrial electron transport chain
and causes oxidative stress that particularly disturbs cancer cells.

undergo apoptosis as response to emodin [6]. Yet there is a
lack of consensus on the compound’s molecular targets and
mechanisms. The wealth of controversial reports on emodin
is most likely evidence for extensive secondary effects caused
by its use rather than a clear explanation of the direct cellular
consequences of emodin treatment.
One of the main characteristics of cancer cells
compared to healthy ones is an extensive prooxidative
state that can lead to intrinsic oxidative stress [8].
Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in cancer
cells are mainly due to their accelerated metabolism and
mitochondrial malfunction [9]. The major site of ROS
generation is the mitochondrial respiratory chain, where

INTRODUCTION
Emodin (6-methyl-1,3,8-trihydroxyanthraquinone) is a
naturally occurring anthraquinone present in a wide variety of
plants, particularly in roots and barks [1]. Diverse beneficial
properties of emodin for human health have been described,
such as anti-bacterial [2], anti-fungal [3], and anti-viral
effects [4]. It is also suggested for treatment of diabetes [5]
and cancer [6, 7]. As antineoplastic agent emodin has been
shown to affect many different tumor cell lines inhibiting
growth of leukemia, breast, colon, and lung carcinoma
cells, amongst others [7]. It is well accepted that cancer cells

erroneous single electron reductions of oxygen at different
redox centers (electron leakage) lead to ROS production
[10]. The high ROS content in cancer cells renders them
more susceptible to oxidative stress–induced cell death
[9]. Moreover, normal and cancer cells differ in their
energy metabolism, a phenomenon referred to as the
Warburg effect [11]: compared to healthy cells, most
cancer cells rely on anaerobic glycolysis rather than on
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP
and precursor metabolites needed for cellular homeostasis
and proliferation [12].
This work originates from the observation that
emodin affects cancer cells in culture while healthy cells
are apparently resistant to its effects. To unravel the
molecular mechanism of the compound, we performed
targeted and global proteomics analyses of healthy and
cancer cells treated with emodin [13]. We characterize its
binding partners and delineate its differential influence
on cancer and healthy cells. Considering the different
metabolic requirements of cancer and healthy cells, we
incorporated a yeast model for respiratory-to-glycolytic
metabolic switches allowing us to generalize emodin’s
effects in eukaryotic cells. This comprehensive approach
allowed us to analyze the influence of metabolic stages
on the effects of emodin and supports the hypothesis that
emodin’s differential effects in cancer and healthy cells
depend on their differential mitochondrial fitness.

was significantly affected by emodin in both healthy and
cancer cells as analyzed by 5-bromo-2’-deoxyuridine
(BrdU) incorporation assays (Figure 1C, Supplementary
Figure 2). Thus, in the performed experiments emodin
appeared to act primarily cytostatic having limited
cytotoxic effects. Due to increased doubling times healthy
cells appeared less affected than cancer cells.
To study the molecular basis of decreased cell
proliferation by emodin treatment we analyzed signaling
pathways known to play a role in cell proliferation and
growth. Analysis of mechanistic target of rapamycin
(MTOR) kinase activity by measuring the levels of
phosphorylation of its direct target ribosomal protein S6
kinase revealed a perturbation by emodin, in correlation
with decreased cell proliferation and protein synthesis
(Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure 1C). It is evident that
under control conditions the levels of phosphorylation
of ribosomal protein S6 kinase were higher in cancer
cells than in healthy cells. Upon emodin treatment,
phosphorylation levels decreased in all cells, A549 cells
responding the least. In agreement with a decrease of
cell proliferation also mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) signaling was negatively affected in cancer cells
by emodin treatment as indicated by a decreased activating
phosphorylation of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2. In
contrast AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity
appeared to increase upon emodin treatment indicating
increased cell stress (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure
1C). Thus, emodin treatment led to a cell line independent
decrease of cell growth- and proliferation-stimulating
signals, increasing cell stress.

RESULTS
Emodin negatively affects cell proliferation

Emodin binds to redox-active enzymes
increasing oxidative stress

Emodin has a detrimental effect on cancer cells in
culture, while healthy cells apparently remain unaffected
by the compound. In this study, we evaluated the response
of primary normal human fibroblasts from skin (NHF),
normal human keratinocytes (NHK), and of MCF7,
A549, CaCo-2 and HeLa cells, which are cancer cell lines
isolated from breast, lung, colon and cervix carcinomas,
respectively, to emodin. Figure 1A and Supplementary
Figure 1 show the phenotypes of above mentioned cells
after 48 h of 70 μM emodin treatment versus control
conditions. Notably, numbers of NHF and NHK were
not affected by the treatment, while numbers of cancer
cells were significantly reduced to 20-30% for all
cancer cell lines (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 1B).
Reduced cancer cell numbers could be due to increased
cell death and/or decreased cell proliferation. As the
numbers of cells after 48 h of emodin treatment were
not less than the respective starting numbers, except in
the case of MCF7 cells, we reasoned that differences in
cell proliferation were the main cause for the observed
phenotypes. To discriminate between increased cell death
and decreased cell proliferation we analyzed apoptosis
and proliferation directly. We only found minor signs of
apoptosis (data not shown), however, cell proliferation

To identify direct protein targets of emodin we
performed affinity purification-based chemoproteomics
experiments. Stable isotope labeling by amino acids in
cell culture (SILAC)-based quantitative mass spectrometry
(MS) of CaCo-2 cells was employed to identify proteins
binding to emodin-coated sepharose beads compared
to ethanolamine-blocked control beads (Figure 2A,
Supplementary Table 1) [14]. In three biological replicates
we identified ten proteins as enriched exhibiting significant
changes in minimally two out of the three experiments.
Interestingly, three of these have a nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) binding domain as
intrinsic characteristic: carbonyl reductases 1 and 3 and
flavin reductase, all being NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases (Figure 2B). Thus emodin, which has a
central quinone group, bound to redox-active enzymes,
possibly interfering with their function. To analyze if
emodin treatment has a global effect on NADPH levels
we quantified NADPH by a colorimetric assay. Indeed,
emodin treatment led to a significant decrease of NADPH
in the total pool of NADP+ and NADPH (Figure 2C).

Global proteomics analyses reveal an effect of
emodin on mitochondria

Next to its important role as cofactor in anabolic
processes, NADPH is vital for other reductive
processes: NADPH is cofactor of glutathione reductase
which recycles glutathione, an important cellular
antioxidant. Therefore, decreased NADPH levels may
indicate increased oxidative stress in emodin treated
cells. To analyze ROS levels we performed fluorescence
microscopy using a fluorescent ROS marker and found
that emodin treatment led to increased ROS levels
(Figure 2D). We also directly analyzed H2O2 levels
and detected an increase in all cells treated with
emodin (Figure 2E). To determine if ROS play a role
in the detrimental effects of emodin on cancer cells, we
compared the effects of emodin alone or in combination
with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC).
Additional antioxidant treatment partially protected
cells and led to an increase in the number of cells after
emodin treatment, especially in the case of cancer cell
lines (Figure 2F). Taken together, emodin directly
bound to redox-active enzymes and interfered with the
cellular NADPH pool. Reduced NADPH was linked to
higher ROS levels observed in emodin-treated cells.
ROS scavengers promoted survival of cancer cells
in the presence of emodin, whereas the influence on
healthy cells was limited.

To gain comprehensive insight into the physiological
consequences of emodin treatment and underlying cellular
responses leading to the observed phenotypes, we chose
an unbiased and global chemoproteomics approach [15].
We analyzed whole cell lysates of five cell types included
in this study by SILAC-based quantitative expression
proteomics experiments. We fully labeled cells with
isotopically labeled amino acids, and subjected them to
control or 24 h emodin treatment. Whole cell lysates of
each cell type corresponding to both control and treatment
conditions were mixed in a 1:1 protein ratio. Proteins in
each mix were analyzed by gel-liquid chromatography
(LC)-MS/MS (Figure 3A). Biological replicates were
performed (Supplementary Figure 3) and respective data
were merged. In total, we detected 4,191 proteins of which
we could quantify 3,761 (Supplementary Table 2). Of
these 2,008 proteins were identified in all five cell types
(Supplementary Table 3).
Principal component analysis revealed that healthy
cells reacted profoundly different to emodin compared
to cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 4). To further
characterize these differences, the data were subjected to

exposure.

hierarchical clustering to study the relationship between
samples, and k-means clustering to group proteins (Figure
3B). Proteins separated into eight k-means clusters, the
response of NHF being clearly distinct from all cancer
cell lines. Proteins in each k-means cluster were tested
on enriched gene ontology (GO) terms [16] (p-value <
0.05). Cluster 3 contains vesicular and lysosomal proteins
which were more abundant in NHF compared to all cancer
cell lines. Cluster 1 includes proteins which were downregulated in all evaluated cells. Interestingly, the majority
of these proteins belong to the mitochondrial respiratory
chain. Particularly down-regulated were complex I protein
components (NDUF and MT-ND proteins) upon 24 h of
emodin treatment. Other respiratory chain complexes were
also affected (complex II, III, IV), but to a lesser extent.
Figure 3C displays known or predicted interactions of
those proteins which were significantly down-regulated in
at least two of the evaluated cell types upon 24 h of emodin
treatment as assessed by STRING DB analysis (p<0.05)
[17]. Especially the above mentioned respiratory chain
subunits and also mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, in
contrast to cytosolic ribosomal proteins, both of the large
and small subunit, were reduced by half after treatment
(Figure 3C, Supplementary Table 3). Interestingly, the
oxygen sensor CHCHD2 which was shown to activate
expression of genes containing oxygen responsive
elements in their promoters under hypoxic conditions
was upregulated [18], indicating a general perturbation of
oxidative metabolism in emodin-treated cells.
Emodin seemed to have only minor effects on the
abundance of other mitochondrial proteins. For example,
components of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
(PDH), and of the citric acid cycle (aconitate hydratase,
malate dehydrogenase and fumarate hydratase) appeared
unaffected. Levels of marker proteins of the mitochondrial
outer and inner membrane were unaltered, as well.
Classical effectors of mitochondrion-associated apoptosis
(cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor) were mostly
unaffected (Supplementary Figure 5). Nonetheless, our
measurements cannot precise the cellular location of these
proteins nor distinguish between their pro- or active-forms.
Figure 3C also shows a cluster of interacting
cytosolic proteins that are known to be involved in cell
proliferation and cell cycle, which were also significantly
downregulated by emodin treatment. This result is in
agreement with the observed decrease in proliferation
rates. Taken together, emodin affected the proteome of
healthy cells differently compared to those of cancer
cells. Our analyses suggest next to redox-active enzymes
mitochondria as its prime site of action.

in all cells analyzed. However, emodin affected the
levels of complex I proteins to a lesser extent in healthy
fibroblasts than in cancer cells (Figure 4A). Western blot
analyses against the nuclear encoded complex I proteins
NDUFA10 and NDUFS1 were in agreement with MS
results (Figure 4B). To study morphological effects of
emodin treatment we performed immunofluorescence
microscopy employing an anti-NDUFS1 antibody with
PFA-fixed cells. After emodin treatment mitochondria
appeared fragmented (Figure 4C), which was also
evident from MitoTracker staining of live cells (Figure
4D). Both staining exhibit swollen mitochondria, clearly
demonstrating mitochondrial stress caused by emodin.
Mitochondrial network fragmentation upon emodin
treatment was in agreement with MS results, which
also showed decreased levels of the mitochondrial
fusion protein OPA1 and of the protease YME1L1 that
is involved in proteolytic processing of OPA1 [19] after
emodin treatment (Supplementary Figure 6).
Compared to healthy cells, mitochondria in cancer
cells function less efficiently leading to higher basal
ROS levels in cancer cells (Supplementary Figure 7). To
determine the role of mitochondrial fitness in the cellular
response to emodin, we used doxycyclin (DOX), an
antibiotic known to affect mitochondria by binding to the
28S mitochondrial ribosome subunit [20–22]. We treated
cells prior to emodin treatment with DOX and evaluated
their response. Notably, DOX pretreatment of cells
rendered healthy cells more sensitive to emodin, while
cancer cells were not significantly affected (Figure 4E).
By western blot we show that DOX diminished levels of
NDUFS1, which were even more decreased by emodin
(Figure 4F). These experiments clearly indicate that good
mitochondrial fitness is a prerequisite to overcome the
effects of emodin treatment.

High respiratory capacities protect from ROS
production and emodin sensitivity
With the aim of further studying the sensitivity of
cells with different respiratory capacities to emodin, we
employed the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Yeast cells
can readily switch between fermentation and oxidative
phosphorylation, and the respiratory capacities of yeast
cultures can easily be modulated by genetic intervention
or by changing the main carbon sources in the growth
media [23]. Yeast cells lacking mitochondrial DNA (ρ0
cells) are incapable to perform respiration, due to the
lack of mitochondrial DNA-encoded essential subunits
of the respiratory chain, and therefore solely depend
on fermentation. ρ0 cells use ATP to maintain the basal
mitochondrial membrane potential, which is a prerequisite
for essential mitochondrial functions, such as Fe/S cluster
biosynthesis [24] and protein import [25]. Consequently,
ρ0 cells are still able to undergo mitochondrion-dependent
cell death [26], and to produce high levels of ROS [27,

28]. In contrast, yeast cells with intact mitochondrial
DNA (ρ+ cells) can switch their metabolism between
fermentation and respiration dependent on the availability
of the main carbon sources. In medium with glucose (Glc)

as carbon source yeast cells undergo fermentation, mainly
because of catabolite repression of respiratory enzymes
by the presence of glucose [29]. In contrast, GalLac
medium contains galactose and lactate as carbon sources

and stimulates yeast cells to respire. In order to analyze
emodin-triggered effects in yeast cells with a broad range
of respiratory capacities, we treated ρ0 cells grown on
glucose containing media (Glc) (no respiratory capacity),
ρ+ cells grown on glucose containing media (Glc)
(respiration is repressed by glucose but basal respiratory
capacity is maintained), and ρ+ cells grown on galactose/
lactate (GalLac)-containing media (high respiratory
capacities). Yeast cultures treated for one to four days
with emodin were evaluated for levels of oxidative stress,
which can be detected by the intracellular conversion
of the ROS-sensitive stain dihydroethidium (DHE) to
fluorescent ethidium [30]. This approach was paralleled
by determining the proportion of surviving cells (colony
forming units, CFU) on nutrient-containing solid medium.
Depending on the respiratory capacity, yeast cells show
different levels of oxidative stress due to emodin treatment
and different survival rates (Figure 5A–5D). The higher
the respiratory capacity of the yeast, the lower the levels
of oxidative stress triggered by emodin treatment, possibly
due to a densely packed and highly efficient respiratory
chain, and due to a highly efficient anti-ROS defense
system. The survival of yeast cultures as well as the
resistance against emodin were higher in respiring cells.
Remarkably, a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain
is not necessary for the cytotoxic effects of emodin,
because emodin reliably kills cells lacking a functional
respiratory chain (ρ0 strain under Glc conditions). A
highly active and efficient mitochondrial respiratory
chain protects from emodin (ρ+ strain, GalLac), whereas
cells with an intact respiratory chain but that primarily
undergo fermentation (ρ+ strain, Glc) are highly sensitive
to emodin. Thus, the respiratory capacity of yeast cells
determines the cytotoxicity of emodin.
Next, we asked whether ROS production is a cause
for or a consequence of emodin-triggered cell death in
yeast. Therefore, we incubated emodin-treated yeast
cells (ρ+ strain, Glc) with different concentrations of
the antioxidant NAC, and measured the levels of ROS
and yeast cell survival. We observed that increasing the
concentration of NAC reduced the levels of oxidative
stress in cells treated with emodin and increased the
levels of oxidative stress in control cells (Figure 5E–5F).
Consistently, elevated NAC levels were protective for
cells treated with emodin and were moderately harmful
for control cells (Figure 5G). Thus, emodin demonstrated
significantly reduced abilities to boost the levels of
oxidative stress and to kill the cells in the presence of
NAC. These data suggest that ROS are causatively
involved in the cytotoxic effects of emodin in yeast cells.

biology, we investigated mitochondrial oxygen consumption and inner membrane potential (Δψ). Emodin
strongly increased oxygen consumption of isolated yeast
mitochondria in the presence of respiratory substrates
(Figure 6A–6C). Addition of ADP to induce coupled
(state III) respiration or valinomycin, an ionophore
of the mitochondrial inner membrane, to reveal the
maximal respiratory capacity caused a similar increase
as the addition of emodin. Additional block of the ATP
synthase by oligomycin did not prevent the increase in
oxygen consumption by the addition of emodin (Figure
6A). We therefore speculated that emodin may possess an
uncoupling activity. To demonstrate the effects of emodin
on the mitochondrial membrane potential, we monitored
an essential conserved Δψ-dependent function of the
mitochondrial inner membrane: import of presequencecarrying precursor proteins into the mitochondrial matrix
via the presequence translocase (TIM23 complex).
The model precursor protein Su9-DHFR [31] was
synthesized in a cell-free transcription/translation system
in a radio-labelled form and incubated with isolated yeast
mitochondria [32]. As shown in Figure 6D, the import
efficiency to the mitochondrial matrix was gradually
impaired by higher concentrations of emodin. This finding
is in agreement with a reduction of mitochondrial Δψ
upon addition of emodin and supports the view that the
compound has an uncoupling activity.
It is known that the physiological status of
mitochondria in cancer cells differs from that in healthy
controls. We evaluated the influence of emodin on the
mitochondrial activity of healthy NHF, and as examples
for cancer cells on A549 and HeLa cells to characterize the
extent to which these cells were affected by the compound
(Figure 6E). Interestingly, cancer cells reacted with a
significantly stronger increase in oxygen consumption to
emodin treatment compared to healthy cells. Moreover,
in agreement to emodin’s influence on cellular NADPH
levels, these measurements suggest that emodin has
additional effects on mitochondrial metabolism in cancer
cells and does not exclusively act as an uncoupler, since
the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl
hydrazine (CCCP) equally increased the oxygen
consumption of both cancer and healthy cells. Importantly,
treatment by both valinomycin and – to a lesser extent –
CCCP did affect the survival of healthy cells similarly to
cancer cells further supporting the notion of additional
effects of emodin treatment (Supplementary Figure 8).

DISCUSSION
Emodin proved to affect mammalian cells in a
differential manner, dramatically interfering with cancer
cell viability, without noticeable consequences for healthy
cells. With the aim of understanding the molecular
mechanism by which emodin causes these differential
effects, we based our studies on targeted and unbiased

MS-based chemoproteomics. We identified emodin binding
partners and in a global fashion analyzed proteomic
changes of cancer and healthy cells upon emodin
treatment. Emodin interferes with the cellular redox
system by binding to NADPH-dependent oxidoreductases.
In addition, in all tested cells emodin significantly affects
levels of mitochondrial proteins, particularly of subunits
of the respiratory chain complexes. The clearest effect of
emodin is the marked decrease in complex I proteins, which
is observed more effectively in cancer cells compared to
healthy ones. All other electron transport chain complexes
show lower protein levels after emodin treatment, however
to a lesser extent than complex I.
The yeast results are particularly interesting since
they demonstrate that the respiratory capacity of cells is of
critical importance for the cell’s susceptibility to emodin. The
compound particularly damages cells kept in fermentative
growth conditions. Increasing the respiratory capacity of
yeast cells protects them from the lethal effect of emodin.
Along these lines, it seems intuitive to expect ρ0 yeast cells to
be more resistant to emodin treatment, since they do not rely
on mitochondria to generate ATP. However, mitochondria
perform key cellular functions other than respiration. Also ρ0
cells, which cannot respire, do have a (reduced) mitochondrial
membrane potential, largely generated by electrogenic
transport processes, like the uptake of ATP from the cytosol
in exchange with ADP generated in the mitochondrial matrix
by the uncoupling hydrolytic activity of the F1-ATPase.
Mitochondria are functionally important in these cells for
other metabolic processes including Fe/S cluster assembly
[24]. It is plausible that interference of emodin with the low
membrane potential of ρ0 cells through its uncoupling activity
is immediately adverse to their survival.
Although the Warburg effect is as yet a matter of
discussion, it is accepted that cancer cells rely more on
glycolysis than on respiration to obtain energy. As seen
from the experiments in yeast, emodin specifically affects
cells with a strong fermentative metabolism, but spares cells
with high respiratory rates. Thus, cells with high respiratory
capacity, like healthy cells, are protected from emodin,
whereas cells with less respiratory capacity, as cancer cells,
are sensitive to emodin. In well agreement, pre-incubation
of mammalian cells with DOX, known to affect 28S
mitochondrial ribosomal subunits, renders healthy cells
more sensitive to emodin treatment, whereas cancer cells are
unaffected by the additional DOX treatment. The marked
fragmentation of mitochondria and the strong decrease of
mitochondrial proteins in treated cells suggest additional
consequences on mitochondria other than the decrease
in complex I proteins. As observed by MS, the depletion
of the mitochondrial fusion protein OPA1 and of the
protease YME1L1 correlates to the observed mitochondrial
fragmentation upon emodin treatment. Of note, it has been
shown that dissipation of Δψ induces enhanced proteolytic
cleavage of OPA1 by the protease OMA1 leading to the
fragmentation of the mitochondrial network [33–35].

The direct protein targets of emodin proved to be
redox-active enzymes. Nevertheless, our data suggest that
another critical molecular mechanism of emodin action is
the partial uncoupling of mitochondria. As the depletion
of the membrane potential occurs immediately after the
addition of emodin to isolated mitochondria, judged by
analysis of membrane-potential-dependent preprotein
import and oxygen consumption rates of mitochondria
(Figure 6), this effect is an early event. We conclude that
uncoupling is a direct consequence of emodin treatment
and unlikely to depend on its interaction with redoxactive enzymes. We demonstrated increased ROS levels
by fluorimetric assays both in mammalian and yeast
cells. The collective term ROS comprises a whole set of
reactive molecules ranging from H2O2, which is also an
important signaling molecule, to highly toxic chemicals
such as superoxide anions or hydroxyl radicals. We
demonstrated increased H2O2 levels, but cannot rule out
that the levels of other ROS are also altered. Of note,
respiratory chain-derived ROS are primarily superoxide
anions that are subsequently converted to H2O2 [36].
The uncoupling activity of emodin does not necessarily
explain the concomitant increase in ROS production;
both effects may be individual, yet additive. A proof of
the primary toxic consequences of emodin-induced ROS
is the attenuated effect of emodin in the presence of
NAC, a ROS scavenger, in all evaluated eukaryotic cells.
Increased ROS levels may also contribute to decreased
NADPH levels via the glutathione reductase system. The
exact nature, sources and consequences of ROS induced
by emodin will have to be addressed in future studies.
Altogether, the majority of the published effects
of emodin appear to be of secondary nature. This
comprehensive study identifies emodin as binding to
NADPH-dependent redox-active enzymes and as a
mitochondrial uncoupler, decreasing mitochondrial
membrane potential. These alterations lead to an increased
oxygen consumption and elevated oxidative stress levels
causing a decrease in the levels of complex I [37],
possibly to avoid further ROS production. Cells with a
high respiratory capacity and a better antioxidant state are
better prepared to survive the cellular consequences of the
treatment, while cells which mostly rely on fermentative
energy production, like cancer cells, are more susceptible
to emodin treatment.
