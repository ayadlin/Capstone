ABSTRACT:
Strigolactones are a novel class of plant hormones produced in roots and regulate
shoot and root development. We have previously shown that synthetic strigolactone
analogues potently inhibit growth of breast cancer cells and breast cancer stem cells.
Here we show that strigolactone analogues inhibit the growth and survival of an array
of cancer-derived cell lines representing solid and non-solid cancer cells including:
prostate, colon, lung, melanoma, osteosarcoma and leukemic cell lines, while
normal cells were minimally affected. Treatment of cancer cells with strigolactone
analogues was hallmarked by activation of the stress-related MAPKs: p38 and JNK and
induction of stress-related genes; cell cycle arrest and apoptosis evident by increased
percentages of cells in the sub-G1 fraction and Annexin V staining. In addition, we
tested the response of patient-matched conditionally reprogrammed primary prostate
normal and cancer cells. The tumor cells exhibited significantly higher sensitivity
to the two most potent SL analogues with increased apoptosis confirmed by PARP1
cleavage compared to their normal counterpart cells. Thus, Strigolactone analogues
are promising candidates for anticancer therapy by their ability to specifically induce
cell cycle arrest, cellular stress and apoptosis in tumor cells with minimal effects on
growth and survival of normal cells.

cancer cell lines [3], thereby adding the SLs to the list of
plant-derived effective anti-cancer agents that are being
assessed for their ability to inhibit the growth and survival
of human cancer cell lines [4-6] [7, 8] [9, 10].
The p38 MAPK is a member of the conserved
MAPK family of dual serine-theronine kinases that
respond to variety of internal and external stimuli. The
p38-MAPK pathway is comprised of four genes; α, β,
γ, δ with p38α being the most abundant isoform [11].
p38α responds to many stress stimuli including reactive
oxygen species, UV irradiation, hypoxia, and proinflammatory cytokines. Considerable data imply that
P38α functions as a tumor suppressor, inducing cell cycle
arrest, differentiation and apoptosis [11, 12]. Mutations in
(p38α) were identified by massive parallel sequencing in
human tumors [11, 13] and xenografts of cells deficient
in p38α signaling exhibited higher tumor burden than
their wild type counterparts [14-17]. Furthermore, p38
was found to be a marker for tumor dormancy and as an
inhibitor of self-renewal [18]. Conversely, recent reports
have suggested that p38α is involved in cell survival
and increased invasion in prostate cancer cells and other
advanced tumor types [19-21], suggesting an addiction
to p38 MAPK activity that was correlated with poor
prognosis [22]. Thus, the role and function of p38 in
tumorigenesis is complex and may be tissue and context
dependent.
The Jun N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway also
plays a major role in cellular stress response. JNK1 and
JNK2 are the most abundantly expressed isoforms of the
JNK family. JNK1/2 exert their effects via regulation of
multiple target genes that contain binding sites for the
transcription factor, AP1 (JUN-FOS)[11, 23]. As with
p38, JNK1/2 have been described as either negative or
positive regulators of cell growth and have been associated
with both pro-apoptotic and pro-survival activities.
Recent studies have found that JNK activation enhanced
chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in multiple cancer cells
[11], while in prostate cancer, especially in tumors that
harbor mutations in PTEN, activated JNK1/2 supports
proliferation and survival [23, 24]. Collectively it appears
that the type of response depends on intensity and duration
of the signals as well as cell type.
Mechanistically, the JNK and p38 MAPK pathways
share several upstream regulators and there is evidence
of cooperation and synergy between downstream targets
such as HSP27, HSP70 and FOXO4 [25, 26]. Perhaps one
reason for overexpression and constitutive activation of
the stressed-related pathways in prostate and other types
of advanced tumors is the constant insults present in the
cancer cell per se including enhanced DNA damage and
accumulation of reactive oxygen species [27].
Our previous work had found that the growth arrest
and apoptosis induced by SL analogues in breast cancer
cell lines occur in part through the activation of the stress
activated MAPKs, p38 and JNK1/2 and reductions in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ERK1/2 and AKT activity. Here we further define the
mechanisms of action, as well as the overall applicability
of SLs as cancer therapeutics. We show that strigolactone
analogues changes the genomic landscape of cells and
despite cells addiction to stress signaling, SL are capable of
eliciting a significant stress response including induction
of multiple heat shock proteins, phosphorylation of
p38MAPK and JNK1/2 and induction of their targets such
as HSP27, HSP70 and FOXO4 [25, 26]. In addition, we
employed the new cell culture technology of conditionally
reprogrammed primary cells (CRCs) that were established
from patient-matched prostate normal and tumor tissues.
The reprogrammed cells can grow indefinitely in the
presence of irradiated feeder cells and ROCK inhibitor and
can model individual patient responses [28, 29].
Prostate tumor CRCs, are significantly more
sensitive to SLs than their patient-matched normal CRCs.
Together, we show that SL analogues produce their
cytotoxic effect in part through activating p38 MAPK and
a prolonged stress response in both transformed cell lines
and in patient-derived CRCs.

RESULTS
Strigolactone analogues are effective growth
inhibitors of a diverse range of cancer derived
cell lines
To determine whether synthetic SL analogues inhibit
the proliferation of cell lines derived from different types
of cancers, a diverse cohort of human cancer lines was
collected comprising prostate, colon, lung, osteosarcoma,
and leukemia derived lines. Cancer cell lines and BJ
normal fibroblast cells were treated with each SL analogue
at a dose range of 1 to 20 ppm (equivalent to 2-60 µM;
Figure 1, Figure S1A and Table 1). After 3 days, XTT
cell proliferation assays were carried out and the changes
in proliferation and cell survival and are presented as a
percent of vehicle controls. All five SL analogues (EG5,
EG9c, ST357, ST362 and MEB55) inhibited cancer
cell growth albeit to varying degrees. In general, ST362
and MEB55 were the most potent inhibitors with the
concentrations required to achieve 50% inhibition of cell
viability (IC50) at day 3 of treatment ranging from 2.8
ppm to 12.8 ppm. EG5, EG9c and ST357 were less potent
inhibitors of prostate, colon and lung cancer cell growth
with IC50 values are mostly above 15 ppm. Interestingly
the Osteosarcoma-derived line, U2OS exhibited a similar
sensitivity to all SL analogues tested (IC50 = 2.7 to 4.5
ppm). None of the analogues tested-reached IC50 values
in concentrations of up to 20 ppm in non-transformed BJ
fibroblast cells (Figure 1). Table 1 summarizes the IC50
values for each cell line.

the G2 rather than the M fraction of the cell cycle (Figure
2B).
Cell cycle progression from G2 to mitosis is
dependent on the timely accumulation and activation of
the Cyclin B1/ Cdk1 complex [31]. Dephosphorylation
of Cdk1 at threonine 14 is a critical step for the complex
activation. Cyclin B1 levels are significantly decreased
following 24 hrs of SL treatment in DU145 (Figure
2C) and HCT116 (Figure 2D) and so is the expression
level of Cdc25C, the phosphatase responsible for Cdk1
dephosphorylation and activation (Figure 2C). However,
no changes in protein levels or Cdk1 phosphorylation
status at Thr14 were noted.
Cyclin B1 levels are regulated by several
mechanisms including transcription and post-translational
modifications that alter its stability. Quantitative Realtime PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed a two-fold or more
decrease in cyclin B1 mRNA in HCT116 and DU145

respectively, following treatment with 10 ppm of MEB55
compared to vehicle controls (Figure 2D). We also found
that SL analogues regulated cyclin B1 protein stability.
Proteasome inhibition with ALLN for 4 or 8 hrs following
24 hrs exposure of DU145 cells to MEB55 or ST362
induced a partial rescue (ST362; 2 fold, MEB55; 1.3 fold)
of cyclin B1 protein levels (Figure 2F). Taken together, SL
analogues regulate cyclin B1 in part by reduced mRNA
synthesis and in part by enhanced protein degradation and
employ alternative mechanisms to induce G2 arrest.

SL treatment induces a non-reversible decrease in
cell viability
Since SL prolonged the G2/M phase of the cell
cycle and increased the accumulation of cells in the subG1
fraction (Figure 2A and 2B), dual staining with Annexin
V, and PI was employed. Annexin V is a marker of early

apoptosis, while PI only stains the chromatin of cells with
compromised plasma membrane and therefore is a marker
of late apoptosis. In HCT116 cells all five SL analogues
increased the percentage of early (Annexin V+/PI-) and
late (Annexin V+/PI+) apoptotic cells in a dose dependent
manner (Figure 3A) and similar results were observed in
two additional colon cancer cell lines, (SW480, HT29,
Figure S2).
Interestingly, we found that the inhibitory and
apoptotic effects of SL analogues are non-reversible, as
DU145 cells treated with MEB55 for 48 hrs were not able
to recover and re-enter the cell cycle following removal
of the analogue and replacement of the growth media
with fresh growth media without MEB55 for additional
24 hrs (24 hrs release). Cell cycle analysis showed that

similar proportions of cells remained arrested at the G2/M
checkpoint and there was no appreciable change in the
subG1 fractions (Figure 3B).
The rapid non-reversible effect of ST357, ST362 or
MEB55 on cell viability of HCT116, DU145 and U2OS
cells was determined following exposure of cells for 1, 4,
8 or 24 hrs after which the different SLs were removed and
media was replaced with fresh growth media for additional
48 hrs release. While a short 1 hr exposure to any of the
SL analogues produced only a modest non-reversible
decrease in cell viability in the three cell lines (Figure
3C-E), 4hrs exposure was sufficient to cause significant
non-reversible reduction in cell viability as measured by
XTT assays. U2OS cells exhibited the greatest sensitivity
(Figure 3E) to SLs treatment, which correlates with the
lower IC50 values in this cell line (Figure 1, Table 1).
MEB55 was the most potent SL, and by 4 hrs treatments
at the concentration of 10 ppm, only a small fraction of
the cells remained viable (HCT116 18%; DU145 39%
and U2OS 0% cells). As expected a further decrease in
cell viability was observed when the three cell lines were
exposed to SL for 8 hrs and 24 hrs.

Strigolactone analogues induce stress response
signaling and inhibit survival signaling
Members of the mitogen-activated protein kinases
(MAPK) superfamily members play a pivotal role in
cell survival and cell death. While ERK1/2 kinases are
mostly involved in cell survival, the stress-related MAPK
kinases, JNK1/2 and p38 elicit either pro- or anti apoptotic
signals depending on signal intensity and tissue type [11].
Following treatment of DU145 cells with MEB55 for 1,
4, 8 or 24 hrs, the expression and phosphorylation of the
three main arms of the MAPK family (Erk1/2; JNK1/2
and p38) were analyzed by immunoblotting (Figure 4A,
Figure S4). p38 MAPK phosphorylation (pp38) was first
evident at 4 hrs of SL treatment and remained elevated at
24 hrs. Phosphorylation of HSP27, a downstream target
of p38 [25], on Ser82 was increased in a similar timedependent manner as pp38 (Figure 4A). JNK1/2 displayed
an acute and robust (15 fold increase) phosphorylation at
4 hrs, which decreased by 50% at 8 hrs and returned to
basal levels at 24 hrs. In contrast, pERK1/2 levels were
reduced 4 fold after 1 hr of treatment and decreased further
between 4 and 8 hrs. The levels of another survival factor,
phosphorylated AKT/PKB, were decreased 6 fold at 8
hrs and further decreased to undetectable levels at 24 hrs
(Figure S4). While similar pattern of signaling activation
was obtained in HCT116 cells (data not shown), in the
non-immortalized ‘normal’ BJ fibroblast line (Figure 4B)
that are resistant to synthetic SL analogue [3], pp38 levels
remained largely unchanged and pERK1/2 levels were
decreased only at 4 hrs.
We next tested whether activation of p38 stress-

and resulting lysates were analyzed by immunoblot analysis

and U2OS cells were pre-treated with pharmacological
inhibitors of p38 (SB203580) and JNK1/2 (SP600125)
prior to the addition of MEB55. While SB203580 was
able to completely block pHSP27 phosphorylation (Figure

JNK1/2 kinase (data not shown). Colony survival assays
were performed in which U2OS cells were treated with

Treatment with SB203580 resulted in an incomplete but
significant rescue of the SL inhibition of colony formation
(Figure 4D), suggesting that both the p38/HSP27 axis and
additional mechanisms are involved.

a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/
EBP) family of transcription factors that is induced by
stress including DNA damage. Moreover, DDIT3 overexpression can induce cell cycle arrest [32, 33] and indeed
both MEB55 and ST362 treatment was associated with
changes in cell cycle-related gene expression. MEB55
treatment was associated with increased expression
of p21cip (CDKN1A), Cyclin F (CCNF), Cyclin A2
(CCNA2) and decreased expression of CDK6. Consistent
with our earlier data, ST362 induced a modest downregulation of Cyclin B1 (CCNB1) expression. Both
MEB55 and ST362 induced Cyclin G2 (CCNG2), an
unconventional cyclin homolog, which is linked to

growth inhibition and whose expression is induced by
DNA damaging chemotherapeutics [34]. SL exposure also
induced changes in the expression of genes involved in
metabolic functions in tumor and stem cells (ALDH1B1,
ABCB1, SLC3A2, SLC44A2, SLC31A2, SLC7A11,
CYP24A1, PTGS2/COX2, PPRC1), cytokines (CCL3L3,
GDF15) and growth and differentiation factors (PGF,
TGFBR11 and FOXD1).
At 24 hrs Supplementary Table 1, SL treatment was
associated with down regulation of cell cycle regulators,
including cyclins (CCNB2, CCNA2, CCNF) and cyclin
regulatory proteins (CCNBP1 (cyclin B binding protein),
CDKN3 (CDK inhibitor 3, a dual specificity phosphatase

and an inhibitor of CDK2 activity), CDCA3, CDC20,
CDC25C, CDCA2), the transcription factor E2F as well
as mitotic genes involved in cytokinesis (KIF23, KIF4A,
KIF11, KIFC1, KIF2C, KIF20A, IF15). The 24 hrs SL
treatment resulted in up-regulation of genes involved in
RNA processing and translation (RN7SK, SNORD3A,
SNORD3C, SNORD3D) and altered expression of
metabolic genes (DHRS2, SLC7A11, DUSP5, SCG5,
ABCA13), growth factors (TGFB1, CTGF) and altered
expression of genes involved in cellular adhesion
(LAMA1, AMPH, ITGA2, SPP1/OPN1, ESM1, CYR61).
ESM1 expression was the second (21.2-fold) and
third (6.9-fold) most up-regulated gene in MEB55 and
ST362 treated groups respectively. ESM1 is a secretory
proteoglycan, whose expression is up-regulated by
inflammatory cytokines. Altered expression of ESM1 has
also been shown to induce cell cycle arrest [35] (Table
S1). To validate the gene expression array data, qRT-PCR
was carried out on 7 genes of which some were the most
altered genes. HSPA6, HSPA1B, Cyp24A, ALDH1, ATF3,
FOXD1 and FOXO4 exhibited similar expression pattern
changes when analyzed by qRT-PCR as that observed by
array analysis (Figure 5B-H).
Next we used the IPA database (Ingenuity®
Systems, www.ingenuity.com) to identify networks and
pathways of genes induced following 6 hrs exposure to
SL analogues. The top up regulated genes confirmed a
general up-regulation of stress and apoptotic responses
that interestingly converge into the p38 pathway (Figure
5I).

None of the analogues caused more than 50% growth
inhibition of normal prostate cells at the concentrations
used.
Cell cycle analysis of primary normal and tumor
prostate cells treated with vehicle, or with the identified
IC50 concentration of MEB55 and ST362 indicated a
significant increase in the subG1 fraction of tumor cells
in response to MEB55 or ST362 (from 6% in control to
40% or 37% respectively, p<0.007), with only a slight
increase in subG1 that was noted in normal cells (P =0.4)
(Figure 6C). To identify the molecular changes associated
with the cellular response of normal and tumor CRC cells
to SLs, cells were treated with the IC50 concentrations of
MEB55 followed by immunoblotting for cyclin B, pp38
as described above. Despite the lack of measureable G2/M
cell cycle arrest, MEB55 caused a dramatic reduction in
cyclin B expression in tumor CRC cells and a pronounced
stress response was elicited by the three different SLs
as determined by induction of pp38 (Figure 6D). In
addition, the assay for PARP1 cleavage confirmed the
robust apoptotic response observed in the tumor derived
CRCs versus the patient-matched normal CRCs from
the same patient (Figure 6D). Taken together, these data
indicate that SL analogues can induce significant and nonreversible apoptotic response in both transformed cancer
cell lines and in patient-derived tumor cells, while sparing
normal cells and therefore may be useful therapeutic
reagents.

Strigolactone therapeutic potential

The present study sought to investigate the antitumorigenic effects of synthetic analogues of the
strigolactone hormone towards human cancer cells. The
array of cell lines used was chosen based on their diverse
origin and oncogene expression status. We show that SL
analogues inhibit the growth of different cancer cell lines
including prostate, colon, lung and osteosarcomas. SLs
also induced cellular stress response leading to cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis in all tumor cells tested but not in
normal fibroblasts. While the mechanisms of SLs growth
inhibition only begin to unfold, our results indicate that
SLs induce G2 cell cycle arrest in all cells regardless of
their underlying genetic alterations, e.g. p53, k-ras or
nuclear receptor status. We further show that SLs are
effective in targeting human primary prostate cancer cells
while being significantly less toxic to normal prostate
cells of the same patient, suggesting that SLs might be
treatment option in advanced prostate cancer.
SL-induced cell cycle arrest is likely mediated by
down regulation of Cdc25C (Figure 2 and TableS1) and
cyclin B1 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 2, Table 2 and
Table S1). We found that down-regulation of cyclin B was
partially rescued by proteasomal inhibition, suggesting
that SLs regulate the expression of cyclin B at least in
part by protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome

DISCUSSION

To further explore the possible therapeutic potential
of the SLs analogous, we utilized the novel model system
of conditionally reprogramed cells (CRCs) [36], codeveloped by us to permit the continuous culture of a wide
spectrum of normal and malignant epithelium [28]. Both
primary normal and tumor cells were obtained from the
same patient and can be propagated indefinitely in vitro in
the presence of irradiated murine 3T3 J2 fibroblast feeder
cells, and Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632, as previously
described [28, 29, 37]. Matched normal and tumor
prostate cells were treated with different concentrations
of SL analogues MEB55, ST362, ST357 and EG9 and the
viability of cells was measured by XTT assays (Figure
6A, 6B and S5). All SLs reduced the viability of prostate
tumor CRCs with MEB55 and ST362 being most potent
and effective. The IC50 of MEB55 in the prostate tumor
CRCs is 1.8 ppm 95% confidence interval [CI95%] 0.2940.427 while the IC50 of MEB55 in normal prostate CRCs
is extrapolated to be > 20 ppm and selectivity for tumor
versus normal cells is highly significant at (p<0.001).
Similarly, the IC50 of ST362 in tumor cells is 2.3 ppm
[CI95%] 0.593 to 0.702 p< 0.001. The IC50 of ST357 in
tumor cells is 5.649 ppm [CI95%] 0.647-0.826 p<0.001.

pathway. Interestingly, in Arabidopsis as well as in other
plants, SLs inhibit root formation by down regulating
cyclin B expression via the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway
[38], suggesting the mechanisms of cyclin B regulation by
SL are conserved between plants and mammals.
MEB55 and ST362 are the most potent SLs and
induce apoptosis in all tested cancer cell lines. Significant
loss of cell viability was initiated between 1 to 4 hrs of SLs
exposure (depending on the cell line and analogue) and
was non-reversible even after removal of the SLs. Notably,
SLs induced apoptosis even at lower concentrations in
the primary prostate tumor cells, which was confirmed
by PARP1 cleavage. SLs had only minimal effect on the
patient-matched primary normal prostate cells. We found
that SLs induce the expression of several pro-apoptotic
genes and inhibit the expression of several survival factors
including the stemness marker, ALDH1, which is critical
for viability and self-renewal of stem cells. These data
support our previous finding that SLs inhibit self-renewal
and are highly potent towards stem-like enriched cells
[3]. We also noted the transient inhibition of ERK1/2 and
a more durable inhibition of AKT in response to SLs.
Inhibition of the PI3-K/AKT pathway has been shown to
play an important role in the cytotoxic effects of another
plant hormone, Methyl Jasmonate [39].
The activation of stress signaling is likely to be an
important contributing factor to SLs’ induced cell cycle
arrest and apoptosis. Array analysis revealed induction
of multiple heat shock proteins and cytokines by 6 hrs
following SLs exposure, which was validated by qRTPCR. HSP6A and HSP7A, the highest inducible genes
(20-158 fold induction), are members of HSP70 family
that act to stabilize proteins against aggregation and
misfolding. While many tumors express high levels of
some HSP70 members, under extreme stress conditions
and DNA damage, the induction of HSP expression,
especially HSP6A contributes to cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis [40]. Interestingly, a protein network constructed
from the top up-regulated genes in response to SLs
clearly indicate the activation of stress related network
with p38 as the main focal point, further supporting our
biochemical observations. In addition, the expression of
stress-induced transcription factor, FOXO4, which is often
phosphorylated and activated by JNK [41] is up regulated
in response to SLs. Furthermore, we show that p38 MAPK
and JNK1/2 were activated as early as 4 hrs following
SL exposure. The functions of JNK and p38 MAPK in
cancer cells are complex; P38 MAPK and JNK1/2 play
a crucial role in cellular stress responses, signaling for
cell cycle arrest [42] and apoptosis [17, 43], yet, in some
cases p38 MAPK and JNK enzymes are associated with
cell survival, aggressive cancer phenotypes including
invasiveness. Interestingly, pharmacological inhibition of
p38 MAPK only partially alleviated the inhibitory effects
of SLs treatment, while pharmacological inhibition of
JNK1/2 together with SLs was toxic. Taken together, these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

data indicate that additional pathways may be involved in
mediating SLs growth inhibitory effects, and the precise
mechanisms remain to be determined.
The innovative technology of conditionally
reprogramed cells (CRCs) is an attractive system for
drug discovery in the era of “targeted therapy” and
“personalized medicine”.
This system of long term cultures of matched normal
and cancer cells that originated from biopsies of the same
patient was recently described [28, 29, 37] and enables
evaluation of the therapeutic index of new compounds
including toxicity and efficacy for individual patients.
Here we used matched cultures of normal and
tumor prostate cells obtained from a patient diagnosed
with gleasons grade 7 prostate cancer. We show enhanced
sensitivity of tumor cells to the two most potent SLs:
MEB55 and ST362 over normal cells, supporting the
selectivity of these SLs seen in cancer cell lines. Taken
together, our data suggest that SLs may be promising
candidates as broad-spectrum anti-cancer agents eliciting
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis via modulation of stress
signaling and abrogation of cell survival pathways. Further
studies are warranted to determine whether the current
findings can be applicable to other cases of advanced
prostate cancer.

METHODS
Cell culture
Cells were grown at 37  °C in a humidified 5%
CO2-95% air atmosphere. All tissue culture media and
serum were purchased from Gibco (Invitrogen), unless
otherwise indicated. LNCaP, DU145, PC3, A549 were
maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS and
HCT116, SW480, HT-29, U2OS (ATCC, Manassas)
were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS
(Atlanta Biologicals).

Conditionally reprogramed cells
Human radical prostatectomy samples were
collected under the auspices and approval of the
Massachusetts General Hospital Institutional Review
Boards. Following detailed pathological analyses that
documented that the tissue sections collected were nearly
exclusively comprised of either tumor or normal cells, the
specimens were processed and established using the CRC
method as previously described [28, 29, 37]. The CRC
cultures were maintained as described on irradiated 3T3
J2 murine fibroblasts in DMEM/F12-medium (Invitrogen)
containing 10 mM Y-27632 (Enzo Life Sciences) and were
passaged every 3–4 days due to rapid proliferation induced
by the ROCK inhibitor. After removal of the feeder cells,
1694

Oncotarget

confluent human prostate cells (HPCs) were detached
by trypsin treatment and passaged 1:10 (4.2 × 105 HPCs
per 75-cm2  tissue culture flask) for 3 days or 1:20 (2.1
× 105  HPCs per 75-cm2  flask) for 4 days onto freshly
irradiated feeders.

After 48 hrs, cells were washed twice with 1 x PBS (pH
7.4), centrifuged at 360g for 10 min at 4oC, and fixed
in chilled ethanol (70%; v/v in PBS) with gentle vortex
mixing. To determine their DNA contents, the cells were
stained with 40 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and analyzed
using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer and CellQuest
analysis software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA).
Where phosphoHistone-H3 staining was carried out, cells
were incubated with polyclonal antibody against phosphoHistone H3 and then with secondary Goat anti-rabbit IgGconjugated to FITC prior to PI staining.

Strigolactone Treatments and Reagents
Strigolactone analogues (Strigolab, University
of Turin) were solubilized in Acetone (Sigma) at stock
concentrations of 5000.0 ppm. Cells were treated at the
indicated doses by diluting the hormone to the required
highest concentration in the appropriate culture medium.
Serial dilutions were performed for subsequent lower
concentrations and final vehicle concentrations equalized.
N-Acetyl-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-norleucinal (ALLN) was
purchased from Sigma. SB203580 and SP600125 were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA). All inhibitors were solubilized in DMSO according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Annexin V staining
Cells were cultured for 48 hrs under the same
conditions as those used for the DNA content/cell cycle
analysis. All the cells were collected and resuspended in
100 µL 1 X Annexin V Binding Buffer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA, USA). 2 µL FITC-Annexin V (BD
Biosciences) was added and incubated for 10 mins in
the dark (room temperature). Cells were then stained
with PI (Sigma, Saint Louis, Missouri, USA) to a final
concentration of 40 µg/mL and the cells were incubated
at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Then, 400
µL of Annexin V binding buffer were added and flow
cytometry was performed using a BD FACSCalibur flow
cytometer. Cells were considered to be apoptotic if they
were Annexin V+/PI- (early apoptotic) and Annexin V+/
PI+ (late apoptotic). Each analysis was performed using at
least 20,000 events.

XTT Viability Assay
Cells were seeded into a 96 well plates at 1500
cells per well in triplicates in normal growing media.
The following day media was replaced with phenol-free
DMEM supplemented with 10% charcoal stripped serum
and the indicated final concentrations of Strigolactone
analogue or vehicle (acetone) alone. Cells were incubated
for 3 days, at which time XTT (2, 3,-bis(2-methoxy-4nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-5-[(phenylamino)-carbonyl]-2Htetrazolium inner salt) reduction was used to quantify
viability according to manufacturer’s instruction
(ATCC). Cells were incubated with XTT reagent for
2-3 hrs at 37  °C in a humidified 5% CO2-95% air
atmosphere. Absorbance was recorded by a photometer
SPEKTRAFluor Plus, Tecan (Salzburg, Austria) at 450 nm
with 750 nm of reference wavelength. Cell survival was
estimated from the equation: % cell survival = 100 × (AtAc), where At and Ac are the absorbencies (450nm) of the
XTT colorimetric reaction (ATCC) in treated and control
cultures respectively minus non-specific absorption
measured at 750nm. Absorbance of medium alone was
also deducted from specific readings.

Immunoblotting analysis
Whole cell lysates were prepared using a lysis
buffer containing: 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5%
NP-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 125
mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM sodium
orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM
sodium β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM PMSF, and a protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and
cleared by centrifugation. Protein concentration was
determined using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce), and
20–50 µg of lysate were separated in a 4–12% SDS-PAGE
gel. After transfer, membranes were blocked for 30 min
at room temperature in 5% BSA (Sigma) in Tris-buffered
saline containing 0.1% Tween-20. Primary antibody
was incubated for either 1.5 hrs at room temperature or
overnight at 4°C. Secondary antibody was incubated for
30 min at room temperature, and proteins were visualized
with West Pico Stable (ThermoScientific). All antibodies
were used at 1:1000 dilution unless otherwise stated.

Hochberg multiple testing correction was utilized to
calculate the False Discovery Rate (FDR) as a reference.
Gene lists were refined by eliminating genes with signal
intensities <100 (log2=6.64) in both comparison groups.

Colony Survival Assay
U2OS cells were either pre-treated with 50 µM
SB203580 for 2 hrs or treated with different doses of
MEB55 for 6 hrs. Cells were then trypsinized and reseeded in triplicates in limited dilutions of 2x103 cells/
well in 6 well plates. Cells were allowed to form colonies
for 14 days during which SB203580 was replenished
every other day. Cells were fixed and stained with crystal
violet and 70% EtOH. Colonies of 50 cells or more were
counted.

Quantitative Real-Time

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) using the manufacturer’s protocol.
1μg RNA was reverse-transcribed in a total volume of 20
μl using the High Capacity cDNA kit (Invitrogen). Primers
were designed using PrimerQuest software (Integrated
DNA Technologies). PCR was performed in triplicate
using an ABI-Prism 7900 instrument (Invitrogen, Foster
City, CA) and SYBR Green (Invitrogen, Foster City, CA)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The expression
of each target gene was normalized to the expression of
GAPDH mRNA and is presented as the ratio of the target
gene to GAPDH RNA, expressed as 2-ΔCt, where Ct is
the threshold cycle and ΔCt = Ct Target - Ct GAPDH.
Experiments were repeated three times.

Statistical Analysis
Results are presented as mean  ±  SD of replicate
analyses and are either representative of, or inclusive
of at least two independent experiments. Statistical
comparisons between two experimental groups were
performed using student’s t-test (2-tailed, paired) whilst
multiple group comparisons were performed using
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Data regarded as being
significant when P < 0.05 (*). Higher power is significance
(p<0.01**, p<0.001***) are also employed and indicated
in each figure legend. IC50 doses for SLs were calculated
by interpolation of the sigmoidal dose response curves
(Graphpad Prism 6.0 software).

Gene expression analysis
Total RNA was prepared from cells treated with
either ST362 or MEB55 (5ppm) for either 6 hrs or 24 hrs
using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA purity was assessed
by an A260/A280 ratio of ≥1.9, and by the integrity of 18S
and 28S rRNA using an Agilent microfluidic chip. Array
analysis was carried out on cDNA prepared from equal
amounts of RNA (5 μg) prepared from duplicate sample
sets. Labeled cRNA was denatured and fragmented at 94°C
for 35 min and then hybridized overnight to an Illumina
human GeneChip representing approximately 14,000
annotated human genes. Expression microarray image was
initially processed by Illuminia® GenomeStudio®, which
outputs the pre-processed data. The pre-processed sample
intensities then were imported into Partek® Genomics
SuiteTM for the differential analysis test. Two-way ANOVA
model was utilized, and the two factors are Time (6-hrs,
