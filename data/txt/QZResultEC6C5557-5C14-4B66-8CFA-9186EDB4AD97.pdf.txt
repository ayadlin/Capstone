BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) on pathologic down-staging of patients with locally advanced urothelial cancer (UC) of the
bladder. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) for clinical
stage cT2-T4, N any, M0 bladder UC at Strong Memorial Hospital from 1999 to 2009. The primary exposure variable
was use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (GC vs none). The primary outcome was stage pT0 at RC. Secondary outcomes included other down-staging end points in the bladder (<pT1, <pT2, <pT3), nodal status, and surgical margins. Linear probability models were used to estimate the effect of neoadjuvant GC on tumor down-staging with
adjustment for clinical staging variables. RESULTS: A total of 160 eligible patients were identified, of whom 25 were
treated with neoadjuvant GC before RC (GC þ RC) and 135 without neoadjuvant chemotherapy (RC only). Stage pT0
at cystectomy was found in 20% of patients in the GC þ RC group and in 5% of patients in the RC group (adjusted
risk difference [aRD] ¼ 16%, P ¼ .03). For other down-staging end points, the estimated treatment effect was as follows (all point estimates favoring chemotherapy): <pT1 aRD ¼ 30% (P ¼ .005); <pT2 aRD ¼ 30% (P ¼ .004); <pT3
aRD ¼ 31% (P ¼ .008); margins aRD ¼ 8% (P ¼ .41); nodes aRD ¼ 4% (P ¼ .74). CONCLUSIONS: Neoadjuvant GC was
found to be capable of down-staging UC in the bladder; however, no effect on disease in nodes was seen in this

Bladder cancer (BC) is the fifth most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the United States, with more than 70,000

new cases and more than 14,000 BC deaths reported in 2009.1 The overwhelming majority of deaths from BC occur among
patients with muscle-invasive disease (stage categories T2-T4). Standard therapy for resectable (T2-T4a) muscle-invasive BC
without known metastases includes radical cystectomy.2 Unfortunately, 30% to 50% of patients with apparently resectable
muscle-invasive BC (‘‘locally advanced’’ disease) in fact have undiagnosed micrometastases at the time of definitive surgery.2,3
Early treatment of micrometastatic disease with neoadjuvant platinum-based combination chemotherapy (PBCC)
administered before cystectomy has been compared with cystectomy alone in several randomized trials. A meta-analysis of
these trials demonstrated that addition of a neoadjuvant PBCC regimen to local treatment improves the average 5-year
survival by 5% on the additive scale (from 45% to 50%).4 Several trials also reported that the use of neoadjuvant PBCC
may increase the probability of pathologic stage zero (pT0) at cystectomy from approximately 12% to 15% in the cystectomy-only arm to 33% to 38% in the PBCC-plus-cystectomy arm.5,6
However, the PBCC regimens used in the trials of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced BC were relatively toxic. In particular, a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin (MVAC), which
appeared to be the most effective regimen in terms of pathologic down-staging and survival, had a relatively unfavorable
toxicity profile, producing severe granulocytopenia (grade 4 or <500 cells/lL) in one-third of all patients treated.5

GC Chemotherapy for Bladder Cancer/Scosyrev et al

In clinical practice, a less toxic neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen composed of gemcitabine and cisplatin
(GC) is now commonly substituted for neoadjuvant
MVAC.7 In the setting of metastatic disease, GC seems to
result in similar clinical response rates and similar survival
as MVAC but with a better toxicity profile, based on a
report from a randomized trial.8
However, it has been argued that extrapolation of
these results to resectable (nonmetastatic) BC is potentially invalid because clinical response of metastatic lesions
may not be equivalent to pathologic down-staging or cure
of locally advanced BC, and survival of patients with metastatic disease is usually very poor despite the use of combination chemotherapy (MVAC or other regimens).7,8
Unlike metastatic BC, which is generally considered incurable, locally advanced disease is potentially curable in
at least half of all cases. Patients with pathologically
organ-confined disease at cystectomy (stage <pT3, pN0)
generally have a favorable prognosis, and those achieving
stage pT0 are almost always cured from BC.5,9 However,
the ability of GC to produce pathologic down-staging and
improve survival of patients with locally advanced BC has
not yet been clearly demonstrated.
This question has been investigated in 2 small single-institution series with somewhat conflicting
results.7,10 In the series published by Dash et al,10 42
patients received neoadjuvant GC and 54 patients
received neoadjuvant MVAC prior to cystectomy. Chemotherapy allocation was primarily determined by calendar
time (patients treated in more recent years received GC).
The distribution of clinical stages favored MVAC: 55% of
patients in the GC group and 41% of patients in the
MVAC group had clinical stage T3/T4. Stage pT0 at the
time of definitive surgery was documented in 26% (11/
42) of patients treated with GC and in 28% (15/54) of
patients treated with MVAC. The authors concluded that
GC is equivalent to MVAC in its ability to produce pathologic down-staging of locally advanced BC.
In the second series published by Weight et al,7 20
patients treated with neoadjuvant GC followed by cystectomy were compared with 88 patients treated with cystectomy alone. The decision to administer neoadjuvant
chemotherapy in this cohort was determined by patients’
ability to tolerate chemotherapy as well as patients’ and
physicians’ preferences. Among patients treated with
chemotherapy, 21% had clinical stage T3/T4 cancers.
The corresponding proportion of cT3/T4 cases for the
cystectomy-only group was not reported. Stage pT0 at the
time of definitive surgery was documented in 10% (2/20)

of patients treated with neoadjuvant GC, and in 9% (8/
88) of patients treated with cystectomy alone. The authors
concluded that the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
not associated with pathologic down-staging in their series. In addition, delays in cystectomy due to chemotherapy were substantial. The median time from diagnosis of
muscle invasion to cystectomy in patients treated with
and without neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 7 months
and 1.5 months, respectively.7
Because these 2 reports reached different conclusions, we decided to examine this question in our own
institutional series. The purpose of the current study was
to investigate the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy
with GC on pathologic down-staging and survival of
patients with locally advanced urothelial cancer (UC) of
the bladder treated with radical cystectomy (RC).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This is a retrospective cohort study of patients treated
with RC for clinical stage cT2-T4, N any, M0 bladder
UC at Strong Memorial Hospital (Rochester, NY) from
1999 to 2009. Patients treated with other neoadjuvant
therapy, with clinical stage <cT2, by partial cystectomy,
with upper tract UCs or with non UCs of the bladder
were not included. The primary exposure variable was use
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (GC vs none). The primary
outcome was stage pT0 at RC. Secondary outcomes
included other down-staging end points in the bladder
(<pT1, <pT2, <pT3), nodal status, and surgical margins. The effect of chemotherapy on the hazard of death
from all causes and from BC was examined in exploratory
analyses.
The following additional covariates were analyzed:
age, sex, race, clinical T stage, radiographic evidence of regional adenopathy, grade and histologic type (ie, pure UC
or UC with non-UC component), major cardiovascular
disease (heart surgery with or without myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, and deep venous
thrombosis not related to surgery), major respiratory disease (asthma, emphysema, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease), non-BC malignancies (all previously diagnosed
malignancies other than nonmelanoma skin cancer),
smoking status (current, former, never), creatinine concentration and clearance, white cell and platelet counts
(documented prior to the initiation of definitive therapy
for locally advanced BC), prior use of intravesical therapy,
and use of adjuvant systemic chemotherapy. Postoperative
chemotherapy was considered ‘‘adjuvant’’ as opposed to

73

Original Article

‘‘salvage’’ if the decision to administer such therapy was
made before known recurrence.
Clinical staging variables were determined based on
transurethral resection pathology reports, radiology
reports, and bimanual examinations. Central pathologic
review was not performed on each specimen in this study.
However, during the study period, consensus review was
routinely used in the pathology department to determine
clinical and pathologic staging variables in equivocal cases
deemed appropriate for such review. The follow-up data
included time from the initiation of definitive therapy
(GC or cystectomy) for locally advanced BC until death
from any cause or end of follow-up (December 31, 2009).
The underlying cause of death was determined by death
certificate. The follow-up data were obtained from the
National Death Index and compared with information
available in the chart for quality assurance.
Statistical Methods
Continuous variables were described and compared with
medians and Wilcoxon tests, and categorical variables
were compared with proportions and Fisher exact tests.
Linear probability models (generalized linear models with
identity link and binomial variance) fit by maximum likelihood were used to estimate the effect of neoadjuvant GC
on pathologic down-staging end points, adjusted for clinical staging variables.11,12 The effects of chemotherapy on
the hazard of death from all causes and the hazard of death
from BC were estimated using the stratified Cox model,
adjusted for baseline covariates.13-15 Proportional hazards
assumptions were tested via covariate-by-time interactions. Assumptions of linearity in the log-hazard were
tested by adding quadratic terms for continuous covariates. Interactions were tested via product terms. KaplanMeier curves and log-rank tests were used to estimate and
compare overall survival. All analyses were performed in
SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary NC). All tests were 2sided. This study was approved by the University of Rochester Ethics Committee.

RESULTS
During the study period, muscle-invading UC prior to
RC was documented in 173 patients, of whom 38
received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and the remaining
135 were treated without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Decision to administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy was
determined by clinical extent of disease, patients’ ability
to tolerate combination chemotherapy with cystectomy,

74

and patients’ preferences. Ten of the 38 patients treated
with neoadjuvant chemotherapy received drug combinations other than GC and were excluded from analysis.
Three of the 28 patients treated with neoadjuvant GC
were found to be ineligible after complete chart review.
Hence, the study cohort included 160 eligible patients, of
whom 25 received neoadjuvant GC and 135 did not
receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Baseline characteristics of these patients documented before the initiation of
definitive therapy for BC are shown in Table 1.
Compared with patients treated without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those who received neoadjuvant GC
were on average younger (64 years vs 70 years) and had
fewer comorbidities. In particular, the proportions of
patients who had neither major cardiovascular disease
(MCVD) nor major respiratory disease (MRD) were
76% in the GC þ RC group and 53% in the RC group
(Table 1). In addition, no one in the GC þ RC group
had a combination of MCVD and MRD, whereas in the
RC group, 7% of patients had such combination. On
the other hand, compared with patients in the RC group,
patients in the GC þ RC group were more likely to have
direct extravesical extension of BC based on clinical staging (76% vs 21%) and were more likely to have regional
adenopathy (36% vs 11%). The chemotherapy group
also included a higher proportion of mixed histology
tumors, although this difference was not statistically significant. The distribution of other covariates was fairly
similar in the 2 treatment groups (Table 1).
Missing values were uncommon in this series. Serum
creatinine, white counts, and platelet counts before the
initiation of definitive therapy for BC were unknown for
7 patients. These patients were excluded from the calculation of the average serum creatinine and creatinine clearance and average cell counts in Table 1 but were included
in other analyses. Smoking status was unknown for 10
patients. These patients were excluded from the calculation of proportions of current, former, and never smokers
in Table 1 but were included in other analyses.
In this series, neoadjuvant GC was typically administered in 3-week cycles according to the following protocol: gemcitabine 2,000 mg/m2 per cycle (as a split dose)
and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 per cycle (as a single dose or a split
dose). During the course of treatment, doses and schedules were adjusted as deemed necessary by medical oncologists based on cell counts and other considerations. The
numbers of cycles completed were as follows: 3 patients
completed 2 cycles, 8 patients completed 3 cycles, and 14
patients completed 4 cycles. The mean and the median

number of cycles completed were 3.44 and 4, respectively.
Median time from diagnosis of muscle invasion to cystectomy was 4.8 months in patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and 1.5 months in patients treated without
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
Tumor Down-Staging
There was evidence of tumor down-staging in the bladder
after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Stage pT0 at cystectomy
was found in 5 of 25 patients (20%) in the GC þ RC
group and in 7 of 135 patients (5%) in the RC group
(model-based risk difference adjusted for clinical stage ¼
16%, P ¼ .03; Table 2). Compared with patients treated

Cancer

without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, those treated with
neoadjuvant GC were also significantly less likely to have
residual invasion of lamina propria, residual invasion of
detrusor muscle, and direct extravesical extension at cystectomy (end points <pT1, <pT2, <pT3, respectively;
Table 2).
In contrast, there was no evidence of a significantly
beneficial effect of chemotherapy on the risk of positive
nodes at cystectomy, even after adjustment for clinical
stage, radiographic regional adenopathy, and the number
of nodes examined (adjusted risk difference 4%, P ¼ .74;
Table 2). The average number of nodes examined was
slightly greater in the GC þ RC group than in the RC

group (21.4 vs 16.1, P ¼ .02). The corresponding
medians were 20 and 15, respectively. Among patients
with positive nodes, the average node density (the ratio of
the number of positive nodes to the number of nodes
examined) was 0.24 in the GC þ RC group and 0.30 in
the RC group (P ¼ .44). In both treatment arms, pathologically positive nodes were primarily, although not
exclusively, associated with direct extravesical extension at
RC (stage pT3; Table 3).
In this series, pelvic adenopathy was not a highly
accurate predictor of pathologic nodal status even in the
absence of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In the RC group,
nodal metastases were found pathologically in 73% (11/
15) of patients with baseline adenopathy and in 39% (47/
120) of patients without adenopathy. Hence, both falsenegatives and false-positives occurred, although the falsenegatives were more common. In the GC þ RC group,
nodal metastases were found pathologically in 44% (4/9)
of patients with adenopathy and in 44% (7/16) of patients
without adenopathy. Four of 5 patients with pT0 after
GC had adenopathy at baseline. Hence, radiographic adenopathy did not predict poor response to GC; however, it
was not a highly accurate indicator of true nodal status.
Although in patients with adenopathy the proportion of
pNþ cases was greater in the RC group than in the GC þ
RC group (73% vs 44%), this difference was based on
small numbers and was not statistically significant (P ¼
.21). In patients without adenopathy, the proportion of
pNþ cases was slightly greater in the GC þ RC group
than in the RC group (44% vs 39%), but this was not statistically significant (P ¼ .79).
The proportions of patients with negative surgical
margins at RC were similar in the 2 treatment groups
(Table 2). After adjustment for clinical stage, the estimated risk difference was 8%, favoring chemotherapy;
however, this was not statistically significant (P ¼ .41;
Table 2). The number of chemotherapy cycles completed
when treated as an ordinal variable (2, 3, 4) was not

76

significantly associated with tumor down-staging in this
series (P > .1 for all down-staging end points in the
crude analysis and after adjustment for clinical stage,
adenopathy, and the number of nodes examined).
We also examined the association of mixed histology
with tumor down-staging. The most common nonurothelial components were squamous (n ¼ 18), glandular (n
¼8), and sarcomatoid (n ¼ 3). Other components were
present in 2 or fewer cases each and included nested cell,
basal cell, clear cell, small cell, lymphoepithelial, plasmocytoid, signet ring, and carcinosarcoma. All patients with
nonurothelial components also had malignant urothelial
histology. Among the 25 patients in the GC þ RC group,
mixed histology, as determined from transurethral resection (TURBT) specimens, was found in 9 patients, of
whom 1 (11%) had stage pT0 (UC with adenocarcinoma
on TURBT), 2 (22%) had stage pTis (both were UC with
squamous differentiation on TURBT), and 6 (67%) had
muscle-invasive disease. Among the 135 patients in the
RC group, mixed histology (based on TURBT specimens) was found in 29 patients, of whom none had stage
pT0, 2 (7%) had stage pTis or pT1 (both were UC with
carcinosarcoma on TURBT), and 27 (93%) had muscleinvasive or more advanced disease. Because of the small
number of mixed histology cases in the GC þ RC group,
analysis of the interaction of treatment with histologic
type was highly imprecise. However, there was no clear
evidence that the down-staging effect was limited only to
pure UCs or only to mixed histology cases. For the primary down-staging end point (stage pT0), the estimated
risk difference for the treatment effect adjusted for clinical
stage was 0.19 for pure UC and 0.12 for mixed tumors,
interaction P ¼ .64).
Survival Analysis
The median potential follow-up time in these series was
32 months. Approximately 55% of the patients were
treated in the last 3 years (2007, 2008, 2009) and therefore had <3 full years of potential follow-up; the remaining 45% were treated in 1999 to 2006 and had at least 3
full years of potential follow-up. A total of 66 of 160
patients (41%) died during the study period. There were
8 deaths among 25 patients (32%) in the GC þ RC group
(all from BC) and 58 deaths among 135 patients (43%) in
the RC group (76% from BC, 24% from other causes,
most frequently cardiovascular disease). We did not
observe any discrepancies between the underlying cause of
death obtained from the National Death Index and information available from the medical record.

Crude Kaplan-Meier survival curves for all-cause
mortality in each treatment group are shown in Figure 1.
The survival function estimate for the GC þ RC group
was fairly imprecise, based on only 8 deaths, but risk
appears lower for GC þ RC over the first 15 months,
though not thereafter, implying potentially nonproportional hazards. These survival curves may not accurately
reflect the treatment effect because the 2 treatment groups
were different with respect to certain baseline characteristics related to mortality (Table 1). Compared with
patients in the RC group, those in the GC þ RC group
were younger and had fewer comorbidities but had more
advanced tumors based on clinical staging (Table 1).
To estimate the treatment effect adjusted for baseline characteristics, patients who had both MCVD and
MRD were excluded from analysis because no one in the
GC þ RC group had both MCVD and MRD, whereas
7% of patients in the RC group had this combination
(Table 1). The restricted cohort included 25 patients (8
deaths) in the GC þ RC group and 126 patients (55
deaths) in the RC group. The treatment effect on all-cause
and BC-specific mortality was estimated using the Cox
model, stratified on MCVD/MRD comorbidity indicator
and clinical stage, and adjusted for regional adenopathy
and age. No adjustment was made for pathologic staging
variables because these variables are in the ‘‘causal pathway’’ from treatment to survival (chemotherapy may
improve survival by shrinking or destroying the tumors,
which would be manifested as pathologic down-staging).
The estimated treatment effect on all-cause mortality was hazard ratio (HR) ¼ .61 (95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.26-1.42; P ¼ .25), in favor of GC þ RC. For the

The most frequently used AC regimens were gemcitabine plus cisplatin (36% of all AC cases), gemcitabine
plus Taxol (19% of all AC cases), and gemcitabine plus
carboplatin (14% of all AC cases). The numbers of cycles
completed were as follows: 4 patients received 1-2 cycles,
8 patients received 3 cycles, 25 patients received 4 cycles,
7 patients received >4 cycles, and for the remaining 5
patients the number of cycles was unknown.
The use of AC was strongly associated with pathologic stage. Among the 49 patients in the AC group, 46
(96%) had either direct extravesical extension or positive
nodes at cystectomy. In contrast, among the 111 patients
treated without AC, 64 (58%) had either direct extravesical extension or positive nodes at cystectomy. Among
patients who had either direct extravesical extension or
positive nodes at cystectomy, the use of AC was associated
with improved survival (HR ¼ 0.40; 95%CI, 0.21-0.78;
P ¼ .007; adjusted for pathologic variables in Table 4 as
well as age and comorbidities). This comparison, however,
was not based on a randomized treatment assignment and
could be confounded by the patients’ ability to tolerate
chemotherapy after cystectomy, which may not be
adequately reflected by comorbidities documented at baseline. Hence, the observed association of AC with improved
survival may not represent the true treatment effect.

DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy with GC on pathologic
down-staging and survival of patients with locally
advanced BC. Our findings suggest that this chemotherapy regimen is capable of down-staging the tumors in the
bladder. In particular, stage pT0 at cystectomy (the primary down-staging end point) was documented in 20%
of patients in the GC þ RC group and in 5% of patients
in the RC group. Both of these proportions were noticeably lower than the corresponding proportions originally
reported from the S8710 trial of MVAC, where stage pT0
was found in 38% and 15% of patients who received cystectomy in the MVAC þ RC and RC arms, respectively.5
However, some patients in the S8710 trial did not receive
cystectomy for various reasons, including disease progression/unresectable disease at laparotomy, personal choice,

78

or unknown reasons. If one makes the conservative
assumption that all patients who did not receive cystectomy in S8710 had residual disease, the proportion of
pT0s in the MVAC þ RC and RC arms of this trial would
decrease to 30% and 11%, respectively.16,17 Both of these
proportions (computed under the most conservative
assumptions) are still noticeably higher than what was
observed in our current study of GC.
The difference between the proportion of pT0s after GC (20%) in our series and the corresponding proportion after MVAC (30%) in the Southwest Oncology
Group (SWOG) study does not necessarily indicate that
GC is inferior to MVAC. It must be recognized that in
our series, one of the main factors that influenced the decision to administer neoadjuvant chemotherapy was clinical evidence of extravesical disease (clinical stage T3þ
and/or adenopathy), while in the SWOG study treatment was randomized and all patients were clinically N0
at baseline. Therefore, patients treated with GC in our
series on average had more advanced disease than
patients treated with MVAC in the SWOG trial. Hence,
if GC and MVAC were equally effective in terms of tumor down-staging, GC would be expected to produce a
smaller proportion of pT0s in our setting.
The proportion of pT0s among patients treated
without neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our series was only
5%, which is somewhat smaller than the corresponding
conservatively estimated proportion in the SWOG trial
(11%), although similar to what has been reported in
other institutional series.3,18 For example, Stein et al
reviewed 1,054 cystectomies performed at the University
of Southern California for biopsy-confirmed muscle-invasive and high-grade nonmuscle-invasive BC and reported
that 6% of patients had stage pT0 at cystectomy.3 In our
study, all patients had documented muscle invasion
before the initiation of definitive therapy for BC, which
may explain the relatively small proportion of pT0s.
Although in our series neoadjuvant GC appeared to
shrink the tumors in the bladder, we did not observe a
clear beneficial effect of GC on disease in the nodes. The
proportions of patients with pathologically positive nodes
were about the same in both treatment groups in the crude
analysis (GC þ RC ¼ 44%; RC ¼ 43%). Adjustment for
adenopathy and clinical stage shifted this balance slightly
in favor of GC, but the adjusted effect was small in magnitude (a risk difference of 4%) and not statistically
significant.
One possible explanation for this is that GC is truly
less effective in the nodes than in the bladder (eg, due to

tissue-specific differences in drug concentrations or tumor-related factors). These possibilities, however, are
purely hypothetical because no data are currently available
to support or refute them. As an alternative explanation,
one must also consider the possibility of residual confounding, which is a general limitation of observational
studies of therapeutic interventions. It may be the case
that the proportion of truly node-positive patients in the
GC þ RC group before the initiation of neoadjuvant
chemotherapy was higher than the proportion of nodepositive patients in the RC group. Although we made
adjustment for adenopathy in the analysis, it is possible
that compared with patients in the RC group, those in the
GC þ RC group had more extensive adenopathy that
could not be completely accounted for in the analysis. In
addition, adenopathy was not a highly accurate predictor
of the true nodal status even without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Both false-negatives and false-positives occurred,
although the false-negatives were more common. These
considerations explain why adjustment for adenopathy
made relatively little difference in the analysis of tumor
down-staging in the nodes. Nevertheless, it appears that if
GC had any beneficial effect on disease in the nodes, it
was not very large in magnitude because as many as 44%
(11/25) of patients in our series had positive nodes after
neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
The effect of MVAC and cisplatin, methotrexate,
vinblastine on the risk of nodal metastases at cystectomy
was not previously reported from randomized trials of
these regimens because nodal status by itself was not an
end point in these trials.5,6 There is some evidence from
observational studies that among patients who present
with radiographic Nþ or even microscopically confirmed
Nþ disease and achieve clinical response to neoadjuvant
MVAC, some patients have pathologically negative nodes
at cystectomy.19,20 For GC, evidence of activity in the
nodes is more limited. In Weight et al’s series, positive
nodes at cystectomy were found in 38 of 88 patients
(43%) treated without neoadjuvant chemotherapy and in
11 of 29 patients (38%) treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (of which 20 patients received GC and 9 received
other regimens).7 These proportions were similar to proportions observed in our series. Hence, although neoadjuvant GC may down-stage the primary tumors in a sizable
proportion of patients, many patients have regionally
metastatic disease at cystectomy despite neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and have a substantial risk of death from
BC. In our series, 8 of 25 patients (32%) in the GC þ RC
group died from BC.

The proportions of patients with positive surgical
margins in our series were similar in the 2 treatment
groups (GC þ RC ¼ 12%; RC ¼ 11%). After adjustment
for clinical stage and adenopathy, the risk difference was
equal to 8% favoring GC, but this difference was not statistically significant. In the SWOG trial, positive margins
were found in 7% of patients in the MVAC þ RC arm
and in 14% of patients in the RC arm (risk difference 7%
favoring MVAC, P ¼ .1).5 Because positive margins are
relatively uncommon even without neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a definitive reduction in the risk of this outcome
after chemotherapy is generally difficult to demonstrate.
Overall survival in the RC group in our series was similar
to that in the RC arm of the SWOG trial (3-year survival
approximately 50%).
The strengths of our study include direct access to
all medical records, which allowed for accurate documentation of all relevant information, and the use of the
National Death Index, which eliminated the problem of
loss to follow-up. The most important limitations of the
current study are lack of randomization in the assignment
of treatment regimens and relatively small sample size.
Lack of randomized treatment assignment is a general limitation of observational studies of therapeutic
interventions because the decision to administer a particular treatment may often be influenced by factors that also
affect the outcome. If all such factors are documented and
accounted for in the analysis, the treatment effect can be
estimated without bias. The feasibility of this may depend
to some extent on the choice of the end point.
For tumor down-staging end points, adjustment for
clinical T stage, adenopathy, and the number of nodes
examined may be sufficient. Although the possibility of
residual confounding cannot be entirely excluded here, its
direction is predictable because in the absence of randomization, those who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy on
average had more extensive tumors (possibly even within
each clinical stage) than those who are treated without
neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In particular, it is possible
that cT3/T4 cases in the GC þ RC group had more
extensive disease than the cT3/T4 cases in the RC-only
group. However, if residual confounding occurred in our
study in the analysis of tumor down-staging in the bladder
(end points pT0, <pT1, <pT2, <pT3), it could not
account for the observed treatment effect because any
such residual confounding would produce bias in the opposite direction.
With nodal status at cystectomy, we observed no significantly beneficial treatment effect, and this could

79

Original Article

theoretically be attributed at least to some extent to residual confounding. Survival analysis could also theoretically
be influenced by residual confounding because complete
documentation by retrospective chart review of all factors
that affect treatment decisions and survival may not be
feasible. Nevertheless, we were able to document the clinical staging variables and the major comorbidities and
incorporate them in the models. Hence, it is unlikely that
confounding played a major role in survival analysis.
In addition to lack of randomization in treatment
assignment, the current study was limited by a relatively
small sample size in the GC þ RC group. Despite this,
there was significant evidence of tumor down-staging in
the bladder by GC (end points pT0, <pT1, <pT2,
<pT3; Table 2). Hence, because the null hypotheses were
rejected, power is not technically an issue in the analysis of
tumor down-staging in the bladder. Nevertheless, small
sample size limits the precision of estimation irrespective
of significance testing, and this must be acknowledged as a
limitation. In survival analysis in particular, the treatment
effect was estimated fairly imprecisely because there were
only 8 events in the GC þ RC group. Limited precision
and power in survival analysis were recognized a priori at
the design stage. For this reason (and because of concerns
about residual confounding) survival analysis was considered mostly a descriptive technique, whereas the primary
end point of the study was defined as tumor down-staging
to pT0.
Another limitation of this study is lack of detailed
information on drug delivery. In this series, neoadjuvant
GC was typically administered in 3-week cycles according
to the following protocol: gemcitabine 2,000 mg/m2 per
cycle (as a split-dose) and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 per cycle (as
a single dose or a split-dose). However, during the course
of treatment, doses and schedules were adjusted as deemed
necessary by medical oncologists based on cell counts and
other considerations, and the details of this were often not
available from the charts because chemotherapy was frequently administered in clinics not directly affiliated with
Strong Hospital. Nevertheless, we were able to determine
the total number of cycles completed for each patient and
include this variable in the analysis.
Finally, it must be emphasized that pathologic
response rates after GC in our study cannot be directly
compared with response rates after MVAC in S8710 due
to differences in study design (observational vs randomized) and inclusion criteria, as well as the high proportion
(almost 20%) of cancelled or aborted cystectomies in
S8710. Hence, we cannot make any definitive claims con-

80

cerning GC’s equivalence to MVAC in the neoadjuvant
setting and acknowledge this as a limitation of the current
study. Nevertheless, because published data on pathologic
tumor response to GC are limited and somewhat contradictory, we believe that our study represents an important
addition to the literature.7,10
In summary, our findings suggest that neoadjuvant
chemotherapy with GC is capable of down-staging the
tumors in the bladder, although we did not observe a
clearly beneficial effect of chemotherapy in the nodes.
There was insufficient evidence that the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy improved survival; however, this
study was not adequately powered for survival analysis.
