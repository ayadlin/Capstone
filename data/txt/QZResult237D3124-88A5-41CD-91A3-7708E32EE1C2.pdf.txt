Abstract
Following mutations in BRAF and NRAS, the RAC1 c.85C>T single-nucleotide variant (SNV) encoding P29S
amino acid change represents the next most frequently observed protein-coding hotspot mutation in melanoma.
However, the biologic and clinical signiﬁcance of the RAC1 P29S somatic mutation in approximately 4% to 9% of
patients remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines possessing the RAC1 hotspot variant are
resistant to RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib). Enforced expression of RAC1 P29S in sensitive BRAFmutant melanoma cell lines confers resistance manifested by increased viability, decreased apoptosis, and
enhanced tumor growth in vivo upon treatment with RAF inhibitors. Conversely, RNAi-mediated silencing of
endogenous RAC1 P29S in a melanoma cell line with a co-occurring BRAF V600 mutation increased sensitivity to
vemurafenib and dabrafenib. Our results suggest RAC1 P29S status may offer a predictive biomarker for RAF
inhibitor resistance in melanoma patients, where it should be evaluated clinically. Cancer Res; 74(17); 4845–52.

Introduction
Hotspot mutations in BRAF and NRAS are well-established
driver mutations in the MAPK pathway (RAF–MEK–ERK
signal transduction cascade), which occurs in more than
50% and 20% of melanomas, respectively (1). The identiﬁcation
of oncogenic mutations in BRAF, predominantly at codon 600
(2), was the main driving force in the development of smallmolecule inhibitors targeting MAPK kinases (MEK) and BRAF
in melanoma, which includes vemurafenib and dabrafenib.
Patients with BRAF-mutant melanomas treated with RAF and
MEK inhibitors have signiﬁcant improvement in progressionfree and overall survival as single agents (3–6). Patient survival
is further improved with the use of combination treatment of

RAF and MEK inhibitors (7). However, most patients treated
with vemurafenib and dabrafenib develop disease progression
within 6 to 8 months (reviewed in refs. 8 and 9). In addition,
some patients present with intrinsic resistance (often termed
de novo) that do not respond at all or have short-lived
responses to RAF inhibitors progressing on drug treatment
in less than 12 weeks.
Recently, two large-scale whole-exome sequencing (WES)
studies have revealed that, in addition to recurrent mutations
in BRAF and NRAS, the next most frequently observed somatic
protein-coding hotspot mutation in melanoma of cutaneous
origin is the RAC1 c.85C>T single-nucleotide variant (SNV)
encoding the P29S amino acid change found in approximately
4% to 9% of melanomas (10, 11). RAC1 is a member of the Rho
family of small GTP-binding proteins whose activity has been
implicated in tumorigenesis and metastasis (12). RAC1 transduces extracellular signals from growth factor, integrin, and Gprotein–coupled receptors, and its best characterized function
is in the regulation of cytoskeleton rearrangement (13).
Although the RAC1 P29S mutation has been shown to be
oncogenic and biochemically active (10, 11, 14), the biologic
role and clinical relevance of the RAC1 hotspot mutation in
melanoma remains unclear. Recent publications on genomic
characterization of matched pre- and posttreated melanoma
samples from patients who received RAF and MEK inhibitors
(15–19) have conﬁrmed many of the acquired resistance
mechanisms identiﬁed in preclinical in vitro studies (20–29).
In one such study, the authors observed a signiﬁcant correlation of the RAC1 P29S hotspot mutation and early resistance in
patients who received vemurafenib or dabrafenib monotherapy (17). Here, we present functional data supporting a role for
the RAC1 P29S mutation in resistance to RAF inhibitors by

maintaining activation of the MAPK signaling pathway. Our
results suggest that RAC1 P29S status in melanoma may be an
important predictor for vemurafenib and dabrafenib resistance in patients, and consequently should be evaluated as
a predictive biomarker to such therapies in the clinic.

Materials and Methods
Sequenom and Sanger sequencing
gDNA was isolated using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen). Mass spectrometric genotyping (Sequenom) was
performed as previously described (10, 30). Sequenom was
employed to test all cell lines used in this study for RAC1, BRAF,
and RAS family member hostpot mutations. Conﬁrmation of
the RAC1 c.85C>T SNV encoding for amino acid change P29S
was validated by amplifying exon 2 with forward (TGCTAACACCGGGTACCTAAAC) and reverse (TCATCCAGTCTCTGTACCTCAC) primers. PCR products were puriﬁed by QIAquick
Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen) followed by bidirectional sequencing with forward (TTTTAACTTAATAGTGAAAGCTA) and
reverse (TGGTCAAAGAAATGTGAAAC) primers on ABI 3730
DNA sequencers using Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing
chemistry.
Plasmids and shRNA
pDONR RAC1 plasmid was obtained from the hORFeome
collection from the Center for Cancer Systems Biology at DanaFarber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA). The c.85C>T RAC1
mutation encoding for amino acid change P29S was generated
using Quick-Change Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis
(Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subcloning was performed by Invitrogen Gateway Technology to a
pLENTI6.3-CMV (Invitrogen) and pHAGE-EF1a-IRES GFP
expression vector that was kindly provided by Dr. Simona
Colla (The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center,
Houston, TX). Inducible shRNA RAC1 and control constructs
were generated using BLOCK-iT Inducible H1 RNAi Entry
Vector Kit (Invitrogen). Subcloning was performed by Invitrogen Gateway Technology to a PLKO-Tet-On vector (a gift from
Dr. Timothy P. Heffernan, The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX). The hairpin sequences were
as follows: shGFP: ACAACAGCCACAACGTCTAT CGAA ATAGACGTTGTGGCTGTTG; shRAC1 71: CGCAAACAGATGTGTTCTTAA CGAA TTAAGAACACATCTGTTTGCG; shRAC1
72: CGTGAAGAAGAGGAAGAGAAA CGAA TTTCTCTTCCTCTTCTTCACG. shLuciferase PLKO-Tet-On plasmid was a
gift from T.P. Heffernan. Lentiviral transduction was essentially performed as previously described (31).
Cell culture and cell viability assays
A375, MALME-3M, 451Lu, IGR1, CP66, and HMVII melanoma cell lines were maintained in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco,
Life Technologies) and WM3060 cells in Leibovitz L-15 medium
(Gibco, Life Technologies) in 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco,
Life Technologies) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed 5% CO2 incubator.
Cell lines were authenticated by short tandem repeat (STR)
DNA ﬁngerprinting (STR proﬁles available in Supplementary
Table S4; ref. 32). Stably expressing doxycycline-inducible
shRNA cells were cultured in Tet System Approved FBS

(Clontech). Doxycycline-treated cells were cultured in media
at a concentration of 0.4 mg/mL. CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assays (Promega) were used to measure viability
following cell treatment with dabrafenib (GSK21118436),
vemurafenib (PLX4032), trametinib (GSK1120212), and MEK
inhibitor (PD325901) treatment (Selleck Chemicals). Brieﬂy,
5,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plates in triplicates and 12
hours later treated with the indicated drug concentrations for
72 to 96 hours. The percentage of cell viability was calculated
by comparing to DMSO-treated control. Analysis and half
maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were calculated by
GraphPad Prism 6 software.
Immunoblots and RAC1 activation assay
Cells growing in monolayers were lysed using Cell Extraction
Buffer (Life Technologies) supplemented with complete protease inhibitors and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail
tablets (Roche). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation,
protein concentrations were determined by DC Protein Assay
(Bio-Rad), and denatured lysates were run on 4% to 12%
Bis-Tris gradient gels (Invitrogen). Gels were transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) before being immunoblotted with indicated antibodies. Cleaved PARP antibody was
obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. RAC1 activation
assays were performed as previously described, according to
the manufacturer's protocol (Cell Biolabs; ref. 10).
Xenograft assays
Four- to 6-week-old NCR-nude female mice were obtained
from Taconic Farms. A375 isogenic cell lines overexpressing
GFP, RAC1 wild-type (WT), and P29S mutant were resuspended in a solution made up of two thirds Hank Balanced
Salt Solution (Life Technologies) and one third BD Matrigel
Matrix (BD Biosciences). Ten million cells were injected in 100
mL volume in 15 mice per group (GFP, RAC1 WT, and the P29S
mutant) and were monitored for tumor formation. An
approximate 100- to 250-mm3 tumor volume was observed
after 1 week of injection, and all mice were given PLX4720admixed chow (AIN-76A diet), with a dose of 417 mg/kg diet
(Plexxikon and Research Diets Inc.). Body weight and chow
were measured to ensure that no signiﬁcant differences
existed in mouse weight or intake between groups during
the course of the experiment. Tumor volumes were measured
biweekly and calculated by the following formula: volume ¼
0.5  [length  (width)2]. Survival end points were deﬁned by
the ﬁrst time point when tumor length reached 15 mm or
there was visible evidence of ulceration. Mann–Whitney
nonparametric tests were used to determine signiﬁcant differences in tumor volume. Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) tests were
used to determine signiﬁcant differences in survival. Twotailed Fisher exact tests were used for comparison of mouse
cohorts that progressed or responded to PLX4720 treatment.
Tumor growth inhibition values (TGI) for GFP, WT, and P29S
groups were calculated by taking sum of tumor volumes at
day 0/sum of tumor volumes on day 19 on PLX4720 treatment.
All mouse experiments were performed with the approval of
Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at MD
Anderson Cancer Center.

RAC1 Hotspot Mutation Confers Resistance to RAF Inhibition

Results

ref. 34). We demonstrate that endogenous RAC1 is found in a
higher active fraction in PBD-binding assays in cell lines
with P29S compared with those with WT (Fig. 1A, compare
lanes 7, 10, 13, and 16; Supplementary Fig. S2A), conﬁrming
that melanoma cell lines with P29S possess higher levels of
activated RAC1.
To investigate the functional role of RAC1 P29S variant in
melanoma, we treated IGR1 and WM3060 cell lines with
inhibitors targeting RAF, MEK, PI3K, and mTOR pathways.
One observation we noted consistently was that P29S-expressing cell lines were less sensitive to both RAF inhibitors
(vemurafenib and dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitors (trametinib and PD325901). IGR1 cells had approximately 40- to 185fold higher IC50 in response to RAF inhibitors and a 4- to 12fold increase in IC50 in response to MEK inhibitors when
compared with RAC1 WT BRAF V600E–mutant cell lines
A375, MALME-3M, and 451Lu (Fig. 1B–E; Supplementary
Table S1). Furthermore, IGR1 cells did not reach below 50%
cell viability even at doses as high as 10 mmol/L in response
to vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, and PD325901 after

RAC1 P29S–mutant melanoma cell lines have higher
levels of activated RAC1 and display differential
sensitivity to RAF and MEK inhibitors
To determine the biologic role of the RAC1 c.85C>T SNV
encoding for the P29S amino acid change, we probed the RAC1
P29S variant status in a panel of melanoma cell lines by mass
spectrometry genotyping (Sequenom; ref. 10). We identiﬁed
two melanoma cell lines with SNV encoding for S29 (IGR1 and
WM3060), which were conﬁrmed by PCR and Sanger resequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1). We documented by Sequenom
genotyping and Sanger resequencing that IGR1 cells harbor a
co-occurring BRAF c.1798_1799GT>AA dinucleotide variant
encoding the V600K amino acid change, whereas the WM3060
melanoma possesses an NRAS Q61K mutation (data not
shown).
It has been shown that RAC1 P29S is found in a higher
active GTP-loaded fraction compared with the WT protein
(10, 11, 33), as measured by RAC1 interaction with the p21binding domain (PBD) of p21-activated protein kinase (PAK;

NRAS Q61K–mutant WM3060 cell line with the P29S variant
was less sensitive to MEK inhibitor treatment compared with
two other NRAS Q61K–mutant melanoma cell lines, CP66 and
HMVII (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S2).
These results suggested that RAC1 P29S modulates sensitivity
to inhibitors of the MAPK pathway in melanoma.

increase in IC50 following trametinib and PD325901 treatment
(Fig. 2B–E; Supplementary Table S3). This effect was also
observed in isogenic 451Lu cells stably expressing RAC1 P29S
and controls from a pHAGE-EF1a plasmid possessing a weaker
promoter (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S3).
Another independent human melanoma cell line, A375, showed
a 3.5- to 7-fold increase in IC50 in response to RAF and MEK
inhibitors in the presence of P29S mutation (Supplementary Fig.
S4; Supplementary Table S3) and similar results were observed
in MALME-3M isogenic cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S5).
We next examined the apoptotic response to RAF inhibition
in our isogenic cell lines by immunoblotting for a marker of
apoptosis, cleaved PARP, in lysates from GFP- and RAC1 P29S–
overexpressing A375 and 451Lu cells treated with dabrafenib.
Consistent with our viability assays, we observed reduced
apoptosis in response to RAF inhibition in cell lines overexpressing P29S (Fig. 3A and B). Similar results were observed
in MALME-3M cell lines overexpressing P29S (Supplementary
Fig. S5D). In addition, P29S-expressing cells maintained elevated MAPK signaling activity as measured by phosphoMAP2K1/MAP2K2 (MEK1/2) S217/S221 levels in response to
RAF inhibitor treatment compared with GFP controls (Fig. 3C).

Complementing the gain-of-function studies above, we generated IGR1 cells stably expressing doxycycline-inducible
RAC1 shRNAs. Upon administration of doxycycline for
72 hours, we observed a decrease in RAC1 protein levels with
multiple independent shRNAs compared with two controls
(shGFP and shLuciferase; Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S6A).
Along with the knockdown of RAC1 expression, we observed
concomitant decrease in MAPK signaling as measured by
decreased levels of phospho-MEK1/2 S217/S221 and phospho-MAPK3/MAPK1 (ERK1/2) T202/Y204 (Fig. 3D). Accordingly, a consistent trend of increased sensitivity to RAF and
MEK inhibitor treatment was also observed in IGR1 cells upon
RAC1 knockdown (Supplementary Fig. S6B–S6E). Taken
together, these in vitro biochemical and drug sensitivity studies
suggest that the P29S mutant of RAC1 can confer resistance to
RAF and MEK inhibitors by maintaining an elevated level of
MAPK activity.
RAC1 P29S decreases the effect of RAF inhibitor on tumor
growth in vivo

Figure 4. RAC1 P29S decreases effect of RAF inhibitor treatment on tumor growth in vivo. A375 cells expressing GFP, RAC1 WT, and RAC1 P29S were injected

subcutaneously in ﬂanks of female NCR-nude mice. An approximate 100- to 250-mm tumor volume was observed after 1 week of injection for all three mouse
cohorts, and all mice were given PLX4720-admixed chow with a dose of 417 mg/kg diet. A, tumor volume measurements in the presence of PLX4720 drug are
shown (15 mice in each cohort) up until the ﬁrst mouse within cohort reached survival end point [GFP: day 38; RAC1 WT: day 23, RAC1 P29S: day 19; day 17,

approximate 100- to 250-mm3 tumor volume was observed,
mice were switched to chow admixed with PLX4720, a preclinical RAF inhibitor (35). This formulation has previously
been shown to deliver high and stable serum concentration
through course of treatment in mice (36). As shown in Fig. 4A,
WT and GFP controls showed initial regression followed by
stable disease over a 19-day course of PLX4720 treatment (TGI
of GFP group, 55%; WT group, 64%; P ¼ not signiﬁcant). In
contrast, RAC1 P29S-mutant–expressing tumors continued to
grow with accelerated rate on treatment (TGI ¼ 280%), achieving signiﬁcantly higher tumor volumes at day 19 [Mann–
Whitney test: P < 0.005 (GFP vs. P29S), P < 0.0005 (WT vs.
P29S); Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S7] when the ﬁrst mouse
in P29S cohort reached experimental end point (determined by
reaching maximal tumor burden). Mice implanted with A375
cells expressing the RAC1 P29S mutants had a worse overall
survival compared with GFP controls on RAF inhibitor treatment [log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test: P < 0.0005 (GFP vs. P29S), P
< 0.05 (WT vs. P29S); Fig. 4B]. Four GFP-expressing tumors

eventually progressed on treatment (determined by criteria of
reaching tumor volume twice the size of original volume before
drug administration); however, only 1 mouse was sacriﬁced for
reaching maximal tumor burden at the end of the experiment
on day 41 compared with 13 of 15 from the P29S-mutant cohort
[Fig. 4B and C; Fisher exact test: P < 0.005 (GFP vs. P29S)]. An
intermediate response was observed for overexpressing RAC1
WT tumors, as 9 of 15 tumors reached maximum tumor burden
by day 41 [log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test: P < 0.005 (GFP vs.
WT); Fig. 4B]. Furthermore, of the tumors that did progress,
GFP control tumors had an almost twice as long doubling time
on PLX4720 treatment (34.5  6.0 days) compared with WT
(19.33  7.6 days, P < 0.01) and with P29S-mutant overexpressing tumors (18.38  3.6 days, P < 0.001; Fig. 4D).

RAC1 Hotspot Mutation Confers Resistance to RAF Inhibition

higher GTP-active fraction compared with cell lines of similar
genotype. We should note that, although some melanoma
oncogenes and tumor suppressors are known to be involved
in familial melanoma, the RAC1 P29S somatic mutation is
caused by presumptive UVB-induced DNA damage and misrepair (C>T transition; refs. 10, 11), and has not been detected as
a germline mutation in the 1000 Genomes database or among
over 2,500 germline exomes sequenced at Yale University (New
Haven, CT; ref. 11). Interestingly, cell lines expressing RAC1 P29S
are more resistant to RAF and MEK inhibitor treatment. Overexpression of the P29S mutant in BRAF-mutant melanoma cell
lines conferred resistance to MAPK inhibitors in vitro. Knockdown of endogenous P29S RAC1 mutant had an additive effect in
decreasing cell viability in response to RAF inhibitors. Finally,
RAC1 P29S overexpression in the RAF inhibitor–sensitive cell
line, A375, resulted in a decreased effect of the drug on tumor
growth in vivo. Taken together, these functional and biochemical
studies support RAC1 P29S as a RAF inhibitor resistance mutation in melanoma.
Our conclusion is supported by clinical data from a recent
study of 45 patients that received vemurafenib and dabrafenib
monotherapy where pre- and posttreatment BRAF V600–
mutant metastatic samples underwent WES analysis (17). Of
the 45 patient data examined, 14 acquired resistance early in
the course of treatment. Interestingly, the 3 patients in this
cohort of 45 with RAC1 P29S mutation were all found to belong
to this early resistance subgroup. The P29S mutation was not
found in any melanoma sample from patients that had a
sustained response to therapy in this study (the enrichment
in the early resistant group was found to be statistically
signiﬁcant). Together, this clinical correlation in context of
our functional results would suggest that RAC1 P29S status in
melanoma may not only confer vemurafenib and dabrafenib
resistance, but may predict those patients with intrinsic resistance to this class of targeted therapy. However, we acknowledge that an adequately powered study in the clinic will be
necessary to deﬁnitively demonstrate the utility of RAC1 hotspot mutation in predicting intrinsic resistance to RAF
inhibitors.
Mechanistically, our studies suggest that RAC1 P29S may
sustain MAPK signaling in the presence of RAF inhibitors.
Phospho-MEK1/2 levels were elevated in A375 isogenic cell
lines overexpressing RAC1 P29S in response to dabrafenib, and
we observed levels of phospho-MEK1/2 S217/S221 and phospho-ERK1/2 T202/Y204 decreased following RAC1 knockdown
of endogenous RAC1 P29S in IGR1 cells. This is consistent with
previous studies implicating RAC1 in the regulation of MAPK
signaling (reviewed in ref. 12), and a recent study demonstrating RAC1 P29S can induce ERK phosphorylation in melanocytes (11). A number of studies have identiﬁed RAF inhibitor
resistance mechanisms, which can be broadly characterized
into groups that include reactivation of the MAPK pathway,

upregulation of the PI3K–PTEN–AKT pathway, and dysregulation of melanocytic signaling (15–29). We cannot exclude the
possibility that there may be alternative mechanisms that
RAC1 P29S can drive RAF inhibitor resistance, including
upstream or parallel to the MAPK pathway. Investigation of
the aberrant oncogenic signaling caused by the RAC1 hotspot
mutation in melanoma, and potential combination therapies
to target this mutation, remains an important area of investigation for future study.
