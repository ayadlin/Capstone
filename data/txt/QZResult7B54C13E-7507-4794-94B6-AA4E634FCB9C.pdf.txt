Abstract
Much recent effort has focused on identifying and characterizing cellular markers that distinguish tumor propagating
cells (TPC) from more differentiated progeny. We report here
an unusual promoter DNA methylation pattern for one such
marker, the cell surface antigen CD133 (Prominin 1). This
protein has been extensively used to enrich putative cancer
propagating stem-like cell populations in epithelial tumors
and, especially, glioblastomas. We find that, within individual
cell lines of cultured colon cancers and glioblastomas, the
promoter CpG island of CD133 is DNA methylated, primarily,
in cells with absent or low expression of the marker protein,
whereas lack of such methylation is evident in purely CD133+
cells. Differential histone modification marks of active versus
repressed genes accompany these DNA methylation changes.
This heterogeneous CpG island DNA methylation status in the
tumors is unusual in that other DNA hypermethylated genes
tested in such cultures preserve their methylation patterns
between separated CD133+ and CD133 cell populations.
Furthermore, the CD133 DNA methylation seems to constitute
an abnormal promoter signature because it is not found in
normal brain and colon but only in cultured and primary
tumors. Thus, the DNA methylation is imposed on the
transition between the active versus repressed transcription
state for CD133 only in tumors. Our findings provide
additional insight for the dynamics of aberrant DNA methylation associated with aberrant gene silencing in human
tumors. [Cancer Res 2008;68(19):8094–103]

Introduction
The existence of small pools of undifferentiated stem and early
progenitor cells within discrete organ sites has been linked to
functional aspects of normal tissue development, maintenance, and
regeneration. Additionally, markers for such cells have been used to

identify cell populations in cancers that may function as a source of
cells giving rise to tumor propagating cells (TPC; refs. 1–3). A direct
role for involvement of TPCs in neoplasia has required the use of
the markers to isolate purified candidate cell populations to allow
experimental validation of their tumorigenic properties (4–16).
Much pioneering work of this type was performed in the
hematopoietic system (4), and subsequently, many studies have
relied heavily on the use of cell surface marker antigens to separate
cellular fractions highly enriched for TPCs in solid tumors, such as
glioblastomas (9), breast (5), prostate (7), hepatocellular carcinomas (14, 15), colon (10–12), pancreatic (16), and head and neck
cancers (13).
In adult and pediatric brain tumors, cells harboring the surface
membrane protein CD133 (AC133; human prominin-1), which is
normally expressed in a subset of putative neural stem/precursor
cells in the normal adult central nervous system, have been
identified (9, 17–19). CD133 belongs to a family of cell surface
glycoproteins harboring five transmembrane domains (20) and was
initially isolated during a gene screen to identify novel antigens
expressed in hematopoetic stem cells (21, 22). CD133-marked cells
in brain tumors have a capacity for unlimited self-renewal, as well
as the ability, in small numbers, to initiate tumor formation and
progression in xenograft model systems (9), thus satisfying key
criteria required for classification of TPCs. With similar approaches,
CD133 has recently been designated as a marker associated with
TPCs in colon cancer (10, 11), although there is controversy as to
whether this is the ultimate such cell population, compared with
cells marked by the surface antigen CD44, in this cancer (12).
Moreover, more recent data indicate that, in normal mouse
intestine, CD133+ cells are later precursor cells than the ultimate
adult stem cell for this tissue (23).
In this report, we identify that abnormal, cancer-specific DNA
hypermethylation in a CpG island in the immediate promoter area
of CD133 occurs frequently in colon cancers and glioblastomas.
This signature for epigenetically mediated transcriptional gene loss
of function in cancer (24, 25) is unusual in its distribution for this
gene. Interestingly, relating to a situation not heavily explored for
other DNA hypermethylated genes, the CD133 promoter DNA
methylation is heterogeneous between cell populations within
individual tumors that this protein putatively marks as having
more versus less TPC properties. The possible dynamics of
aberrant DNA methylation for this cancer gene, compared with
most other genes for which this change has been described, are,
thus, explored and discussed. Biological implications of modulating

Abnormal Promoter DNA Methylation of CD133 in Tumors

CD133 expression, with respect to mechanisms of gene repression,
are explored through manipulating the DNA methylation status of
the promoter.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatment. Colorectal and glioblastoma cell lines
(HCT116, SW480, RKO, HT29, Caco-2, Lovo, COLO 320, COLO 205, DLD1,
SW48, SW620, T98G, and U87 MG) were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) and cultured in appropriate medium and under
conditions described by ATCC, with media obtained from Invitrogen,
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bio-Products) and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Double knockout (DKO) cells (HCT116
cells with genetic disruption of DNMT1 and DNMT3b) were cultured as
previously described (26), as were the HSR-GBM1 (previously known as line
0913 by Vescovi and colleagues) glioblastoma-derived neurosphere cells
(27). The Duke University cell lines (GBM; D566 MG, D263 MG, and
D54 MG) were a kind gift of Dr. Gregory Riggins at Johns Hopkins
Oncology Center. For demethylation studies, cultured cells were treated
with 1 Amol/L 5-aza-2¶-deoxycytidine (DAC; Sigma) for 72 h with media
changed every 24 h. Trichostatin A (TSA; Sigma) was obtained from Sigma
and used to treat cells at a concentration of 300 nmol/L for 18 h. Mock drug
treatments were performed in parallel with drug-free PBS.
Flow cytometric analysis and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.
Antibodies used in this study include CD133/1(AC133)-PE, CD133/
1(AC133)-APC, CD133/2 (293C3)-PE (Miltenyi Biotec), mouse IgG1-APC,
and mouse IgG1-PE (BD Pharmingen). Cells were stained according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on BD
FACSCalibur multicolor flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Dead cells were
gated out by using 7-aminoactinomycin (BD Pharmingen) staining. Scatter
plots were used to exclude cell aggregates. At least 10,000 events were
acquired for each analysis. Cells expressing levels of CD133 higher than
those seen in IgG controls were considered positive. All data were analyzed
by BD CellQuest Pro v. 5.2 (BD Biosciences). Cell sorting was performed on
BD FACSVantage Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences). Cells with upper 15% or
lower 15% fluorescent intensity of CD133 were collected for experiments.
Primer design. For expression studies using reverse transcription–PCR
(RT-PCR), we designed primers using the open access program Primer3.10
Primer sequences for methylation-specific PCR (MSP) analysis were
designed using MSPPrimer (28),11 and their location in the CD133 promoter
is indicated in Fig. 1C. All primer sequences are listed on Supplementary
Table S1.
Gene expression and methylation analyses. Total RNA was extracted
from cell lines using the RNeasy minikit (QIAGEN) treated with DNase
(QIAGEN) protocol and 1 Ag total RNA subjected to the Superscript II
first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For MSP analysis, DNA was extracted after a standard
phenol-chloroform extraction method. Bisulfite modification of genomic
DNA was carried out using the EZ DNA methylation kit (Zymo Research).
We performed methylation analysis of the CD133 promoter using MSP
primer pairs covering the putative transcriptional start site in the 5¶ CpG
island (29) with 1 AL of bisulfite-treated DNA as template and JumpStart
Red Taq DNA polymerase (Sigma) for amplification, as previously
described (30).
Primary colorectal and GBM tumor samples. All primary tumor
samples used for this study were derived from formalin-fixed and paraffinembedded surgical tissue samples obtained from the archive of the
Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University Hospital, with approval
from the institutional review board. This study compiles data for primary
colorectal cancers of tumor stages I to III (n = 16) and normal colon
controls (n = 19). GBM primary tumor genomic DNA from cancer (n = 15)
and noncancer specimens (n = 5) were obtained from the neuropathology

archives after obtaining approval from the institutional review board of the
Johns Hopkins Hospital. Five noncancer brain tissues used in this study
were also obtained from the Brain Tumor Stem Cell Laboratory at Johns
Hopkins, with institutional review board approval. Genomic DNA was
prepared using standard phenol-chloroform extraction methods.
Western blotting analysis of CD133 protein. Xenograft tumor tissues
were prepared, as described previously (31). Lysates were cleared of
insoluble material by centrifugation. Samples were boiled in SDS sample
buffer, equal amounts of protein were loaded and electrophoresed through
SDS-PAGE gels, and resolved proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P
membranes (Millipore). Membranes were blocked with 5% milk dissolved in
TBS containing 0.02% Tween 20 and then incubated with primary antibody
diluted in the same buffer. We used antibody against CD133 (Abcam) and
h-actin (Abcam) at 1 Ag/mL and 1:5,000 dilution, respectively, for
immunoblot analysis. Blots were developed with Super Signal Chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) was performed, as previously described (32, 33). For each
immunoprecipitation, 4 Ag of either anti–dimethyl-histone H3 (Lys4),
anti–trimethyl-histone H3 (Lys27), or rabbit IgG (Upstate) or 2 Ag of anti–
histone H3 antibody (Abcam) were used in a total volume of 4 mL.
Immunoprecipitated DNA was collected using magnetic Dynabeads protein
A and Dynabeads protein G (Invitrogen). After reverse cross-linking, DNA
was treated with 0.2 Ag/AL RNase A (Amersham), 0.2 Ag/AL proteinase K
(Invitrogen), recovered using QIAquick PCR purification kit columns and
solutions (QIAGEN) and was eluted in a final volume of 100 AL.
Immunoprecipitated DNA was then quantified by real-time PCR using the
QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR kit (QIAGEN). Primers were designed for three
different regions of the CD133 promoter (Fig. 5B). All primer sequences are
listed in Supplementary Table S1. The enrichment of each histone mark was
analyzed after normalization of the bound DNA for each mark to the
amount of DNA associated to histone H3 at the same region of the
promoter.
Tumorigenicity assay. Cells were harvested before inoculation and
resuspended in serum-free medium at a concentration of 5  107/mL. Cells
(5  106/0.1 mL) were then inoculated s.c. at the proximal dorsal midline
into 3-wk-old to 4-wk-old female athymic nu/nu mice (Harlan). Tumor sizes
in two dimensions were measured twice weekly, and volumes were
calculated using the formula (L  W 2)  0.5, wherein L is length and W
is width, as previously described (34). Mice were housed in barrier
environments with food and water provided ad libitum.

Results
CD133-positive cell numbers are enhanced by treatment
with demethylating agents or genetic deletion of DNA
methyltransferases. Although best characterized for identifying
normal brain stem cells (35, 36) and TPCs in brain tumors (9),
CD133 has also been used as a marker for colon cancer TPCs
(10, 11). It is in this latter context that we first noted an unusual
relationship between promoter DNA methylation and CD133
expression. In characterizing CD133 cells as a marker for TPCs in
the colon cancer cell line HCT116 and a derivative of this line, in
which two DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3b, have
been genetically disrupted, the DKO cells, we found, as expected,
low levels (0.3 F 0.1%; Fig. 1A, top) of CD133+ cells in the parent
line but markedly increased levels of such cells in the DKO line
(46.1 F 4.4%; Fig. 1A, top). These latter cells have lost nearly all
genomic 5-methylcytosine and hundreds of DNA hypermethylated,
and silenced genes become demethylated and reexpressed (26, 37).
To further test why the DKO cells express high levels of CD133, we
subjected the parent line HCT116 to pharmacologic induction of
DNA demethylation with DAC. We compared the effects of DAC
treatment to treatment of the cells with the histone deacetylase
inhibitor trichostatin A, which is known not to induce reexpression

Abnormal Promoter DNA Methylation of CD133 in Tumors

of genes harboring densely DNA hypermethylated promoter CpG
islands (38). We observed an increase of a CD133+ subpopulation of
cells in DAC-treated HCT116 cells (5.1 F 0.3%) compared with
mock-treated (0.3 F 0.1%) or TSA-treated (0.6 F 0.2%) cells, as
shown in Fig. 1A.
To test, preliminarily, whether CD133 hypermethylation also
occurs in brain tumors, in which CD133 has been shown as a
putative marker for TPCs as well, we applied similar pharmacologic induction of DNA demethylation to cultured human
glioblastoma (GBM) neurospheres (HSR-GBM1), originally isolated directly from glioblastoma patient samples by Vescovi and
colleagues and enriched for CD133+ tumor cells (27). Consistently, we observed significant increases of a CD133+ subpopulation of cells in DAC-treated HSR-GBM1 cells (80.2 F 2.8%)
compared with mock-treated (40.6 F 4.7%) or TSA-treated
(48.9 F 2.7%) cells, as shown in Fig. 1B. Taken together, our
results obtained in two independent systems using both CRC
and GBM cell lines with either genetic or pharmacologic
demethylated genomes indicated significant increases in
CD133+ cells, thereby suggesting a role for promoter methylation
in the regulation of CD133 levels.
Expression and DNA methylation of CD133 gene in human
colorectal cancer and glioblastoma cell lines. Despite the
potential importance of CD133 in stem cell biology, little is known
about the transcriptional regulation of CD133 expression. One
recent report analyzing the human CD133 gene 5¶ untranslated
region (UTR) identified at least seven alternatively spliced isoforms
and three putative promoters within a CpG island located between
upstream alternative 5¶ UTR and exon 2 (ref. 29; Fig. 1C). To query
these sequences for methylation, we first designed primers in two
different regions, MSP1 primers for an upstream promoter region
ahead of alternate exon 1B and MSP2 primers for a more
downstream promoter area around exon 1C for MSP assays of
the HCT116, DKO, and HSR-GBM1 cell lines. We found complete
methylation of the promoter region CpG islands in HCT116 cells,
partial methylation in the HSR-GBM1 cell line with somewhat
more in the MSP1 region, and no detectable methylation in the
DKO cells (Fig. 1D). This result correlated precisely with the levels
of CD133 protein levels in the cell lines as assayed by flow
cytometric analysis confirming that cell surface CD133 levels in
these cultured tumor cells directly correlated with promoter DNA
hypermethylation. Importantly, we confirmed the MSP results for
methylation with bisulfite sequencing of the two primer regions
(primers BST1 and BST 2; Fig. 1C) with excellent agreement. Thus,
there is, in the sequencing, virtually complete methylation of the
entire CpG island in HCT116 cells, more methylation in the MSP1
than the MSP 2 region in HSR-GBM1 cells, and lack of methylation
in the DKO cells (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Having confirmed our MSP primers and their monitoring of
methylation density to protein expression, we next expanded our
study to include a panel of CRC and GBM cell lines and compared
the DNA methylation status of CD133 with expression of the gene
as examined by sensitive RT-PCR analysis before and after DAC
treatment. The primers for this assay monitor exon 5, which is
common to all transcripts reported for CD133 in brain and colon
(29). Importantly, we first found that we could detect CD133
expression in normal colon (Fig. 2A), as would be expected given its
defined presence in a subset of expanding cells above the intestinal
crypts (23). In addition to HCT116, we detected little or no CD133
expression in four CRC lines, SW480, RKO, COLO 320, and DLD1,
and all of these lines showed increased expression of CD133 after
DAC treatment (Fig. 2A). Complete or partial methylation of the
gene was found, using the upstream MSP1 primer set (Fig. 2B), in
three of these cell lines, HCT116, SW480, and RKO, and partial
methylation in a fourth (DLD1), indicating good correlation
between low expression and presence of promoter DNA methylation in four of five cell lines, with the exception being COLO 320.
Interestingly, DAC also increases the expression of the gene in this
latter cell line, indicating that the drug can activate the gene
through influences on chromatin other than those associated with
DNA demethylation or that upstream factors have been activated
by the drug which up-regulate expression of the gene. In contrast to
the above cell lines, significant basal expression of CD133 was
found in six CRC lines (HT29, Caco-2, LoVo, COLO 205, SW48, and
SW620), and this expression was not changed by DAC treatment
(Fig. 2A). Two of these cell lines (HT29 and Caco-2) were
completely unmethylated for CD133, whereas there was partial
methylation in the other four cell lines (LoVo, COLO 205, SW48,
and SW620; Fig. 2B).
In the panel of GBM cell lines, low level expression of CD133
transcripts was found in five of the six examined, including T98G,
U87 MG, D566 MG, D263 MG, D54 MG, and HSR-GBM1. HSRGBM1, the neurosphere cell line, which is enriched for CD133+
cells, had high basal expression (Fig. 2C) with partial methylation
(Fig. 2D). Also, as we observed in colon, high-level CD133
expression was detected in normal brain (39), and after DAC
treatment, three cell lines displayed significantly increased levels of
CD133 transcripts (T98G, D566 MG, and D263 MG), whereas two
showed more modest increases (U87 MG and D54 MG). The T98G
and D54 MG cell lines showed lack of gene expression correlated
with complete methylation by the MSP reaction. U87 MG and D566
MG cell lines showed amplification products in both methylated
and unmethylated MSP reactions, consistent with partial methylation (Fig. 2D).
We also have examined the above CRC and GBM cell lines, using
our more downstream set of MSP primers (MSP2; Supplementary

Fig. S3A and B). The methylation pattern of MSP2 in colon cancer
cell lines showed a similar pattern to the MSP1 primer set in
Fig. 2B. However, in the GBM cell lines, including those fully
methylated as studied with the MSP 1 primers above (T98G and
D54), the MSP2 primers detected partial and less methylation
compared with the results with the MSP1 primers (compare Fig. 2D
with Supplementary Fig. S3B). Taken together, these data suggest
that the region upstream of alternate exon 1B, examined by the
MSP1 primer set, generally correlates best with the expression
of CD133.
Methylation of the human CD133 gene promoter in primary
CRC tumors and GBM tumor samples. Having confirmed a high
frequency of hypermethylation in the CD133 promoter in CRC and
GBM cell lines, we investigated the methylation status of the gene
in primary, noncultured tumor samples. We first established, using
the MSP1 primers, that CD133 promoter methylation was absent in
normal colon and brain using samples from noncancer patient
tissue (Figs. 3A and 4A). This indicates that CD133 methylation
may constitute an abnormal finding in tumor cells. Indeed, we
discovered that a surprisingly high frequency (10 of 16, 62%) of the
primary CRC samples analyzed had some degree of CD133 gene
methylation (Fig. 3B). In the GBM primary tumors, we observed
similar results with 93% (14 of 15) having some degree of CD133
gene methylation (Fig. 4B). Using the MSP2 primers, we again
detected no methylation in normal colon and brain (Supplementary Figs. S4A and S5A), but methylation was seen in primary CRC
and GBM samples at a lower frequency than we showed with MSP1
in Figs. 3B and 4B (Supplementary Figs. S4B and S5B). These data
were similar to the analyses in CRC and GBM cell lines. Taken
together, our data suggest that CD133 hypermethylation arises
sometime during the progression of primary CRC and GBM and is
not a normal regulatory event for the gene during cell renewal
processes.
To further study relationships between the abnormal CD133
promoter methylation and expression of the gene in tumors, we
examined a panel of serially passaged GBM xenografts. These
xenografts have been extensively characterized for molecular
characteristics that can be investigated to understand the basis
of variation in GBM response to specific therapies (31, 40) and
would be expected to be enriched for TPCs as measured by their
recapitulation of molecular alterations, such as epidermal growth
factor receptor amplification, found in human GBM tumor samples
(41). Here, we examined a panel of these tissues for associations
between CD133 protein expression level and methylation status.
The results indicate a striking heterogeneity for CD133 methylation
in these samples which does not strongly correlate with protein
expression. The majority of samples show strong signals for
unmethylated alleles compared with the methylation signals for
alleles of the CD133 gene (Fig. 4C). Because we are monitoring
human, and not mouse, sequences in these samples, these
unmethylated signals clearly emanate from tumor cells. Ten (X5,
X8, X9, X12, X14, X19, X20, X21, X22, and X24) of 15 (X2, X5, X6, X7,
X8, X9, X12, X14, X15, X17, X19, X20, X21, X22, and X24) samples
which have little or no CD133 protein expression by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4D) have methylation signals (Fig. 4C). In contrast,
only 3 (X13, X16, and X23) of 9 (X1, X3, X4, X10, X11, X13, X16,
X18, and X23) xenografts with protein have methylation. Clearly,
then, whereas there may be some relationship in tumors, for the
steady-state population dynamics between CD133 expression and
the methylation status of the promoter, other mechanisms than
DNA methylation may also help determine expression levels of

CD133. Studies of chromatin composition of the CD133 promoter
region, detailed later below, help expand our understanding of this
expression control.
Occurrence of CD133 DNA hypermethylation in subpopulations of tumor cells and relationship to hypermethylation of
other genes. Much experimental evidence suggests that CD133+
and CD133 cells isolated from human tumor GBM and CRC
samples differ in their capacity to initiate and propagate tumors in
animal xenograft model systems (9–11) with the CD133+ cells
requiring small number of cells to initiate rapidly growing tumors.
Although the dynamics underlying the appearance of CD133 DNA
methylation, differentially between tumor cell populations, is not
clear, we suspected that this pattern seemed to be an unusual event
with respect to abnormal promoter DNA methylation in cancer.
Generally, for many of the genes involved, one speculates that tight
epigenetic silencing would favor tumor cell survival or growth of all
populations. However, for CD133 from the marker roles predicted,
it is expected that its expression would be dynamic being high in a
minority of TPCs with higher tumorigenicity and lower in larger
numbers of cells with lesser tumorigenic properties. We, thus,
wondered whether other genes might also show similar differences
in methylation patterns, perhaps indicating global hypermethylation differences between putative TPCs versus less tumorigenic cell
populations in general. To test this, we used fluorescence-activated
cell sorting to isolate highly purified CD133-positive and CD133negative cell fractions (>90% pure for each expression state;
Supplementary Fig. S2) from the HSR-GBM1 cell line neurospheres,
and subjected these to MSP analysis. To verify the efficiency of
separation, we first tested the methylation status of the CD133
promoter, which, as anticipated, displayed strong methylation
in the CD133-negative, but less in the CD133-positive, fraction
(Fig. 5A). We next examined, in unsorted HSR-GBM1 and CD133positive and CD133-negative cells sorted from this cell line, the
methylation status of seven genes well known to be DNA
hypermethylated with high frequency in multiple cancer types,
including p16, sFRP1, GATA4, GATA5, O6-MGMT, p73, and TMS1.
We also examined four additional genes, TAC1, CLIC3, CST6, and
CDA, all recently identified as DNA hypermethylated in GBM as
identified in a genome-wide screen (42). We, finally, looked at
Sox17, a gene known to regulate fetal hematopoietic stem cell
function (43) and recently identified in our laboratory to be DNA
hypermethylated in CRC with high frequency (44). None of the
tested genes showed differential methylation patterns between the
two different subsets of cells (Fig. 5A) being either fully methylated
(sFRP1, TAC1, CLIC3, MGMT, and SOX17), partially methylated
(CST6, CDA, and TMS1), or unmethylated (GATA4, GATA5, p16, and
p73) in both CD133+ and CD133 cell populations. These data
then imply that CD133 DNA hypermethylation is unusual in the
degree to which it differs in extent between tumor subpopulations
of cells invoked to be more or less tumorigenic.
CD133 expression is associated with a balance between
enrichment of dimethyl-H3K4 and trimethyl-H3K27. Because of
the unusual dynamics seen directly above, for CD133 promoter
DNA methylation between tumor cell populations, we wondered
how this might associate with chromatin changes we have
previously associated with densely DNA-methylated cancer genes
(32, 45). In this regard, we have associated a balance between two
histone marks: dimethyl-H3K4 (H3K4me2), a histone modification
associated with active genes, and trimethyl-H3K27 (H3K27me3), a
mark placed by the polycomb complex (PcG) in low expression
genes (46). We have observed that the PcG mark is present at

densely DNA-methylated cancer genes and remains and even
increases after DNA demethylation leads to a low reexpression
state for the genes (45). However, the active H3K4me2 mark
is far lower when the genes are DNA methylated than when
they are demethylated and reexpressed (45). Essentially, these
above relationships seemed to hold for CD133. We examined, by
quantitative real-time PCR ChIP assay, three different regions
around the 1B transcription start site within the CpG island in the
CD133 promoter and normalized the values to those for
localization of total histone H3 to these regions (Fig. 5B) in
HCT116, RKO, Colo320, DKO, and Caco-2 cells. The H3K4me2 mark
dominates over the PcG, H3K27me3 mark, which is, however, still
present at all regions of the promoter studied in the DKO and
Caco-2 cells, where CD133 is completely DNA unmethylated and
expressed (Fig. 5C). This pattern fully resembles the bivalent
chromatin seen in a group of low expression genes in embryonic
cells (47) and, in our previous work (45), for other DNA
hypermethylated genes when they are reexpressed in association
with the removal of DNA methylation. In contrast, in wild-type
HCT116 cells and RKO cells, where CD133 is fully DNA hypermethylated and silenced, little enrichment of H3K4me2 over
histone H3 is observed at any of the promoter regions examined.

www.aacrjournals.org

CD133 promoter H3K27me3 enrichment is detected, but at low
levels in these cell lines. Notably, in Colo320, where CD133 is
silenced but in the absence of DNA methylation, there is a very
significant enrichment, compared with all of the other cell types
examined, of the repressive H3K27me3 mark at all regions studied,
with striking dominance over the presence of the active H3K4me2
mark (Fig. 5C). These above data, in summary, suggests that PcG
may play its strongest role for CD133 silencing in the absence of
DNA methylation and that this PcG mark functions in a balance
between DNA methylation and levels of the active mark H3K4me2
to help determine the states of CD133 expression exhibited by the
CRC lines studied.
Does induced DNA demethylation and reexpression of
CD133 correlate with appearance of TPCs? Although there is
no known function of CD133 expression in TPCs, one might
question whether our unique ability to induce increasing
populations of CD133 expressing cells, as we have with DAC
treatment of cells or in the DKO cells, would yield cells with
increased tumorigenic potential. We, thus, tested this question for
the DKO cells. In fact, although this isogenic counterpart of the
wild-type HCT116 CRC line has nearly 50% CD133-positive cells,
these cells are unable to grow tumors in nude mice (Fig. 5D). This

could be evidence of lack of a true relationship for the CD133 mark
in defining the most tumorigenic cells or, more likely, because of
the effects of the profound overall DNA demethylation in DKO
cells, including its associated reexpression of many known and
candidate antitumor genes (37).

Discussion
Numerous markers have been used to isolate and characterize
stem-cell like TPCs. For example, specific types of leukemia harbor
cells with a CD34+/CD38 phenotype (6), which can induce cancer
after serial transplantation. Breast and prostate cancer TPCs have
been characterized by CD44+/CD24 low lin (5) and CD44+/a2
hhi
1 /CD133+ (7), whereas TPCs in brain tumors, including
medulloblastoma (17, 18) and glioblastoma (9, 19), and, most
recently, in colon carcinomas (10, 11) have been said to harbor the
CD133+ marker.

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (19). October 1, 2008

Whereas the CD133 marker stands as the principal one for TPCs
in the brain and a potential one in CRC, there is still controversy as
to whether the populations of cells carrying this feature are the
ultimate tumorigenic cells in these cancers. With regards to CD133,
recent evidence (48) suggests that only a subset of primary GBMs
are maintained by CD133+ TPCs. Some GBMs that lack CD133
expression can be driven and sustained by CD133 brain tumor
stem cells with the abilities to self-renew, differentiate, and form
tumors in nude mice. Results presented here that show a lack of
detectable CD133 expression in several serially passaged GBM
xenografts (Fig. 4D) are consistent with the concept of CD133
GBM cells that can self-renew and perform as TPCs.
We have observed an unusual, consistent cell heterogeneity for
abnormal CpG island promoter DNA methylation in the CD133
gene in two tumor types. In normal development and adult cell
systems involving these cell systems, expression of this gene is
thought to define normal stem/precursor cells in brain and a small,
more transient expansion precursor cell population in colon (23).
Clearly then, expression of CD133 is normally down-regulated
during normal lineage commitment and cell differentiation, but
our data indicate that this expression shift is not associated with
dense promoter methylation in these settings. Our very sensitive
MSP assay would have most certainly picked up such a cell
population because most cells in brain and colon would be
expected to have the down-regulated expression discussed above.
Thus, the CpG island methylation we observe in brain and colon
cancers seems to constitute yet another example of an abnormal
and cancer-specific imposition of the DNA modification on
epigenetic gene regulation in neoplasia.
How, then, do we explain the heterogeneity of DNA methylation
in terms of cell populations for CD133 within the cancers? Clearly,
there is some relationship between the methylation and expression
status of the gene, because we see enrichment for the silent state
and more DNA methylation when we separate cells in the GBM
neurosphere lines and we see up-regulation of expression that
generally corresponds to drug-induced and genetically induced
inhibition of DNMTs. However, the steady-state relationships
between the DNA methylation and expression of the gene in both
cell lines and primary tumors are less clear. This suggests a
dynamic shifting in cell populations where down-regulation is not
one-on-one correlated with the DNA methylation and, at least
initially, controlled by the same mechanisms that would occur in
normal cell renewal and does not involve DNA methylation. The
DKO cells, where the DNA methylation has been completely erased
and which yet have a mixture of cells with and without CD133,
illustrate this well.
We have also found that many genes which get abnormally DNA
methylated in cancers have, in embryonic cells (33) and adult
cancers (especially when DNA methylation is removed and the
genes are reexpressed; ref. 45), a promoter chromatin pattern that
others have termed as ‘‘bivalent’’ (47, 49). This is characterized by
the presence of the PcG mark H3K27me3 but balanced by the
simultaneous presence of the activating mark H3K4me. Such
chromatin, which is well seen (Fig. 5C) for CD133 in multiple CRC
cell lines studied, including HCT 116 cells and their isogenic
counterparts, the DKO cells, is thought, in embryonic cells, to hold
genes in a state of low, ‘‘poised’’ transcription until they need to be
activated, at which time there is a shift in the promoter chromatin
toward the active H3K4me mark (47, 49). This dominance of the
H3K4me mark is seen for CD133 in the Caco-2 cells (Fig. 5C), a cell
line which has uniformly high expression of the gene.

Abnormal Promoter DNA Methylation of CD133 in Tumors

For most tumor suppressor genes that become abnormally DNA
hypermethylated in cancer, their expression would select against
tumor cells so they exist in a state of low expression, in early cell
populations which enter tumor progression, and in their later
progeny. Indeed, as we now show for a series of genes in our
present study, abnormal promoter DNA methylation and the
heritable silencing patterns associated with it seem to be set and
maintained between CD133 and CD133+ cells isolated from a
GBM neurosphere cell line and which have sharply differing status
of CD133 methylation. Moreover, for many genes, we and others
(50–55) have shown that abnormal promoter CpG island
methylation arises early in tumor progression at preinvasive
stages. Thus, from the beginning of tumorigenesis, these genes
are vulnerable for the imposition of DNA methylation, which
facilitates abnormal retention of tight transcriptional silencing and
is reflected in all of the tumor cell populations throughout the life
history of the cancer.
To our knowledge, for the process of abnormal gene promoter
DNA hypermethylation in cancer, the present observations for
CD133 are unique in showing striking heterogeneity between
isolated cell populations in a single-tumor culture line. Certainly,
heterogeneity, such as DNA methylation, has been observed in total
cell populations from cultured and primary cancers for genes other
than CD133. However, this seems to be a more uniform heterogeneity involving cells throughout the tumor and manifesting as

quantitative differences between alleles of a given gene (56). This
latter type of abnormal promoter CpG island DNA methylation can
even be quantitatively shifted by changes in environmental
surrounding for the tumor cells, as we have shown for the
E-cadherin gene in culture (57). Interestingly, others have reported
hypermethylation of the CpG island located in the promoter region
of the stem/precursor cell marker CD44 used to identify TPCs in
breast and colon cancers, with concomitant gene silencing in
human prostate cancer (58) and neuroblastoma (59). However,
whether this is a stable or dynamic mark is not known. It will then
be of great interest to exploit the situation observed for CD133 as a
model for how abnormal promoter DNA methylation patterns
evolve during tumorigenesis.
Finally, our studies may be important for the consideration of
using ‘‘epigenetic’’ therapy (60) to target reversal of abnormal gene
silencing in cancer. It is, in this context, antithetical to think such
treatments might be beneficial if, indeed, one result might be
reexpression of a marker, such as CD133, that may define a TPC
population of cells. However, in the context of reexpressing a
battery of abnormally DNA methylated genes, hundreds of which
seem to be present in a given primary tumor (37), this may not be
a problem. In fact, as we show, DKO cells, in which widespread
DNA demethylation has occurred in a setting where a large
population of CD133+ cells has appeared, are no longer tumorigenic in nude mice (Fig. 5D). This question opens up an area for
