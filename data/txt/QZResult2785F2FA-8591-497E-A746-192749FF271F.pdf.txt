ABSTRACT
Complete remission by induction therapy in acute myelogenous leukemia
(AML) can be achieved due to improvements in supportive and optimized therapy.
However, more than 20% of patients will still need to undergo salvage therapy, and
most will have a poor prognosis. Determining the specificity of drugs to leukemia
cells is important since this will maximize the dose of chemotherapeutic agents
that can be administered to AML patients. In turn, this would be expected to lead
to reduced drug toxicity and its increased efficacy. We targeted Notch-1 positive
AML cells utilizing fucose-bound liposomes, since activation of Notch-1 is required
for O-fucosylation. Herein, we report that intravenously injected, L-fucose-bound
liposomes containing daunorubicin can be successfully delivered to AML cells that
express fucosylated antigens. This resulted in efficient tumor growth inhibition in
tumor-bearing mice and decreased proliferation of AML patient-derived leukemia
cells. Thus, biological targeting by fucose-bound liposomes that takes advantage of
the intrinsic characteristics of AML cells could be a promising new strategy for Notch-1
positive-AML treatment.

Notch-1 is a homolog of the translocation-associated
Notch homologue (TAN-1) discovered in the t(7;9)
(q34;q34) translocation in some T-cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia patients (T-ALL) [3]; its ligands are modified by
a protein O-fucosyltransferase 1 (POFUT1) that attaches
L-fucose to a serine or threonine within EGF domains
[4, 5]. High expression of Notch-1 has been reported
to be a predictive marker for a poor prognosis in AML
patients [6] and is thus proposed as a therapeutic target
in hematological malignancy [7, 8]. However, targeting
Notch-1 by using an activator such as γ-secretase, or by
the deletion of POFUT1, has been shown to result in
gastrointestinal toxicity [9]. Therefore, directly targeting
Notch-1 or the specific delivery of γ-secretase to Notch-

INTRODUCTION
Approximately sixty percent of patients with acute
myelogenous leukemia (AML) will achieve complete
remission by induction therapy due to improvements
in supportive, and increasingly optimized, therapy [1].
However, more than 20% of patients will still need
to undergo salvage therapy, with most having a poor
prognosis [2]. Based on such previous reports, determining
the specificity of drugs to leukemia cells is important
to improve a considerable proportion of AML patients’
prognoses, since minimizing the dose of administered
chemotherapeutic agents would be expected to lead to
reduced toxicity and increased efficacy.

positive leukemia cells is necessary to improve treatment
strategies.
L-fucose is a monosaccharide that is a common
component of many N- and O-linked glycans and
glycolipids produced by mammalian cells [10]. As reported
previously [11], we focused on the specific biological
characteristics of metastatic pancreatic cancer, especially
fucosylated antigens such as sialyl Lewis X (SLX) antigen
and carbohydrate antigen-19-9 (CA19-9), which are found
in the sera and tumor tissues of patients [12, 13] and are
used as tumor markers in detecting cancer and in the
evaluation of treatment efficacy. Furthermore, enhanced
expression of fucosyltransferases (FUTs) has been reported
in various cancers. FUTs are key enzymes accelerating
malignant transformation through the fucosylation of
different sialylated precursors. It has been reported that
enhanced activity of FUT3 is associated with the increased
metastatic potential of colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma
cells [14], suggesting that fucosylation may play an
important role in disease progression. These observations
indicate a high requirement for L-fucose by various cancer
cells [15]. Indeed, we, together with others, have reported
that enhanced FUT activity facilitated the metastatic
potential of colorectal cancer cells, thus highlighting this as
a therapeutic target for cancer therapy [16].
The siglecs (sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin
superfamily lectins) are immunoglobulin superfamily
members that recognize sialylated ligands [17]. Most prior
studies of siglec specificities have focused on α 2–3- and α
2–6-sialyllactos (amin)es, and on one or two of the siglecs
at a time. Of the various existing siglecs, siglec-3 (CD33),
which is expressed in AML patients, has been reported to
be affected markedly by the presence of an α1–3-linked
fucose. To target AML cells directly, therefore, CD33
seems to be a promising molecule.
In this study, we targeted Notch-1 positive AML cells
by utilizing fucose-bound liposomes, since activation of
Notch-1 is required for O-fucosylation by POFUT. Herein
we report that intravenously injected L-fucose-bound
liposomes containing daunorubicin can be successfully
delivered to AML cells that express fucosylated antigens.
This resulted in efficient tumor growth inhibition in tumorbearing mice. Thus, biological targeting by fucose-bound
liposomes utilizing characteristics intrinsic to AML cells
could be a promising new strategy for AML treatment.

expressed an appreciable amount of CD33 as previously
reported [18]. Notch-1 expression was also examined,
being found in HL60, RPMI8226, and KG1 cells, but not
in Molt4 cells. We then analyzed the mRNA expression
of POFUT1 in various leukemia cells line (Figure 1B,
1C, Supplementary Figure 1) and found that this directly
correlated with Notch-1 expression. However, we did not
observe a relationship between other FUTs and Notch-1
expression (Supplementary Figure 1). Thus, the expression
of CD33 and Notch-1 correlated in the same leukemia cell
lines.

Targeting Notch-1 positive cells by fucose-bound
liposomes
We then investigated whether Notch-1 positive
leukemia cells could be targeted by L-fucose-bound
liposomes. As reported previously [11], aminated
L-fucose was cross-linked via 3,3´-dithiobis[sulfosuc
cinimidylpropionate] (DTSSP) to liposomes prepared
by a modified cholate dialysis method to achieve a final
concentration of 25 (F25) or 50 µg/ml (F50). Furthermore,
bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS3) and Tris were then
coupled to hydrophilize the liposome surface, which
normally prevents uptake by the reticuloendothelial
system in the liver and spleen, as well as by macrophages
and vascular endothelial cells, and can also prevent
adsorption to opsonin proteins in plasma; consequently,
systemic retention of liposomes is prolonged [19].
Almost all L-fucose-bound liposomes (Fuc-Liposomes)
were spherical in shape and, in the case of FAM- and
daunorubicin, were approximately 70 – 100 and 170 nm,
respectively, in size (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). The
zeta-potential, representing the negative electric charge of
the liposome surface, was below -40 mV (Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2), which meant it was sufficiently
hydrophilized for stealth functions.
Using these Fuc-Liposomes, we added FAM
encapsulated L-fucose-liposomes (Fuc-Liposome-FAM)
to Notch-1 positive or negative leukemia cell lines to
confirm the specificity of delivery. As shown in Figure
2A, fluorescence microscopy revealed that F50-FucLiposomes, but not F0-Fuc-Liposomes, effectively
introduced FAM into the cytosol of HL60 cells. However,
Molt4 cells, which do not express Notch-1, did not show
uptake of FAM. Furthermore, flow cytometry analysis
showed that after 2 h of incubation, F50-Fuc-Liposomes,
but not F0-Fuc-Liposomes, effectively introduced FAM
into the cytosol of HL60 cells that expressed Notch-1
(Figure 2B). Since we previously confirmed that uptake of
L-fucose is mediated by its receptors [11], excess L-fucose
decreased the efficiency of this process (data not shown),
indicating that the introduction of FAM by Fuc-Liposomes
is indeed L-fucose-dependent. Thus, Notch-1 positive
leukemia cells were found to be targeted by L-fucosebound liposomes.

RESULTS
Expression of CD33 and Notch-1 in leukemia cell
lines
We first analyzed the expression of CD33 and
Notch-1 in various leukemia cell lines. As shown in Figure
1A, the expression of CD33 was observed in all cell lines
except for Molt4. It should be noted that RPMI8226
cells, which were derived from a multiple myeloma,

Effect of Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin on the
growth of leukemia cell lines

cytotoxicity was not seen in normal cells such as
peripheral blood mononuclear cells, fibroblasts, human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), or primary
keratinocytes, probably due to their low requirement for
L-fucose, as previously described [11]. Therefore, FucLiposome-daunorubicin particles were found to inhibit
the growth of Notch-1 positive cells in vitro in a fucosedependent manner without affecting various normal cell
types.

We then encapsulated daunorubicin into FucLiposomes. Fuc-Liposome- daunorubicin particles were
approximately 170 nm in size, and the final concentration
of daunorubicin was estimated at 1 mg/ml (Supplementary
Table 2). This size of nanoparticle is postulated to allow
penetration through the smallest capillary pores within
the cancer vasculature by an enhanced permeability and
retention (EPR) effect, but without breaching the bloodbrain barrier [20]. The cytotoxicity of Fuc-Liposomedaunorubicin was tested using a BrdU cell proliferation
assay (Figure 3). Cultured leukemia cells were exposed
to Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin or Liposome-daunorubicin
for 2 h and then washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline to test the efficacy and specificity of daunorubicin
transfer into Notch-1 positive cells. Because we
observed the greatest cytotoxicity using F50-Liposomedaunorubicin (50 µg/mL fucose; Figure 3), we selected
this condition for the following experiments. In Notch-1
positive cells (HL60, KG1), F50-Liposome-daunorubicin
exerted more potent effects than control liposomes (F0Liposome-daunorubicin), indicating fucose-dependent
cytotoxicity (Figure 3). In addition to the effects on
Notch-1 leukemia cell lines, the growth of other cancers,
such as pancreatic and biliary cancer cell lines which
produce CA19-9, were effectively suppressed by F50Liposome-cisplatin, indicating the potential applicability
of this nanoparticle technology for the treatment of
different types of cancer (data not shown) [11]. Moreover,

Fuc-Liposomes carrying daunorubicin
suppressed tumor growth and prolonged
survival of mice in a xenograft model
In order to test the effects of Fuc-Liposomedaunorubicin on tumor growth in vivo, we developed a
HL-60 xenograft model in mice. These animals were
treated with Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin twice a week for
three weeks (Figure 4A). Tumor growth was significantly
inhibited by treatment with F50-Liposome-daunorubicin
compared with no treatment, F0-Liposome-daunorubicin,
or daunorubicin alone in HL60-bearing mice, suggesting
that F50-Fuc-Liposome delivered daunorubicin
specifically and efficiently (Figure 4B; P < 0.01, 4C). In
hematoxylin-eosin staining of tumor tissues, many viable
tumor cells were observed in untreated mice (Figure
4D). In contrast, the number of tumor cells decreased
in daunorubicin-treated and F0-Liposome-daunorubicin
treated-mice as compared with untreated mice. However,
in mice treated with F50-Liposome-daunorubicin, tumor
cells almost completely disappeared. TUNEL staining

revealed the presence of greater numbers of apoptotic cells
in tumors treated with F50-Liposome-daunorubicin than
in controls (Figure 4D), possibly due to the more marked
accumulation of daunorubicin in tumor tissue.
No adverse effects, including body weight changes,
attributable to the administration of either D-mannose or
F50-Liposome-daunorubicin were observed during this
study (data not shown). Thus, as with in vitro experiments,
Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin inhibited tumor growth in
vivo in a HL-60 xenograft model in mice, possibly by an
apoptotic mechanism.

with Notch-1 expression (data not shown). We examined
the effect of Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin on leukemia
patients’ Notch-1 positive and negative cells. As shown
in Figure 5B, F50-Liposomes containing daunorubicin
effectively suppressed Notch-1 positive cells but not
negative cells, indicating that fucose bound-liposomes
specifically targeted Notch-1 positive leukemia cells
isolated from patients. However, further investigation
is required to verify the specificity and efficacy of F50Liposomes containing daunorubicin. Thus, fucose-bound
liposomes carrying daunorubicin suppressed Notch-1
positive, but not Notch-1 negative, AML cells from
patients.

DISCUSSION

We extended our observations to testing leukemia
cells derived from AML patients. As shown in Figure
5 and Tables 1 and 2, 11 cases out of 12 AML patients
were found to express Notch-1. Furthermore, CD33
expression by leukemia cells from patients also seemed
to be compatible with Notch-1 expression. As shown in
Figure 5A and Supplementary Figure 2, a correlation was
observed between CD33 and Notch-1 expression at R =
0.534 (P < 0.001). However, clinical presentation, such as
prognosis, sex, age, and remission rate did not correlate

Presently, more than 20% of AML patients are
required to undergo salvage therapy, with most having a
poor prognosis [2]. Therefore, increasing the specificity
of drugs to leukemia cells should lead to an improvement
in the prognoses of a considerable proportion of AML
patients, and minimizing the dose of chemotherapeutic
agents administered would be expected to lead to their
reduced toxicity and increased efficacy. The present
study demonstrated that fucose-bound liposomes carrying
daunorubicin could effectively target Notch-1/CD33

positive leukemia cells using the intrinsic requirement for
L-fucose by such cells.
Notch-1 has previously been identified as a
TAN-specific mutation in T-ALL patients [3]. Recent
investigations have highlighted that Notch-1 shows a
variety of roles in maintaining homeostasis in human
cells and also plays an important role in carcinogenesis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

[5]. Such findings demonstrated that Notch-1 signaling
maintained tumor growth, antiapoptotic signaling,
epithelial-mesenchymal transition for cancer cell
metastasis, angiogenesis, and cancer stem cell survival
[5]. Our strategy to target cancer cells, which actively
take up L-fucose to produce fucosylated proteins such
as sialylated antigens and growth factors in response to
38593

Notch-1 activation, can be utilized for killing Notch1-expressing cancer cells in the same manner [16]. As
described in this report, our drug delivery system has the
potential to specifically target cancer cells with reduced
toxicity and high efficacy.
We did not find any adverse events when
fuc-liposomes carrying an anti-cancer drug were
administered twice a week to tumor-bearing mice,
suggesting that its non-specific distribution to normal
tissue was very low due to a high accumulation in
tumors. The positive-targeting of cancer cells by a
specific molecule using antibody-bound liposomes
had been expected to be less toxic due to its specific
distribution; however, this strategy presented several
obstacles. Antigens targeted by modified liposomes are
not specific to tumor cells, and may be competed with
by antigens existing in the blood, resulting in damage to
normal tissue or cells. Gemtuzumab ozogamicin (GO)
was developed using this concept of directly targeting
AML cells, and has been shown to be effective in
relapsed AML patients [21]. However, remission rates
have typically not exceeded 25% [22], indicating that
targeting CD33 in the treatment of AML patients also
requires improvements in strategy.
In regard to this issue, fucose-bound liposomes
accumulated only in the liver; this distribution was
eradicated by the administration of D-mannose, indicating
that tissues other than liver do not actively take up
L-fucose under normal conditions. In normal bone marrow
cells, Notch-1 expression has been reported to be very low
compared with leukemia cells [23, 24]. This phenomenon
has also been confirmed in our previous report [11]. Thus,
fucose-bound liposomes carrying anticancer drugs may be
less toxic than any other drug delivery system already in
clinical use.
It has been shown that cancer stem cells can selfrenew symmetrically or can divide asymmetrically to
produce daughter cells, which continue to proliferate to
sustain tumor growth. Notch-1 has been demonstrated
to play an important role in regulating cancer stem cells
[25], suggesting that fucose-bound liposomes could also
target these cells. Indeed, we found that pancreatic cancer
stem-like cells expressing CD24/CD44 were targeted
by L-fucose liposomes (data not shown). These results
suggest that the majority of AML cells, including cancer
stem cells, that exist during relapse or are resistant to
conventional chemotherapy, may effectively be treated by
L-fucose liposome therapy.
The Notch signaling pathway is also involved in the
acquisition of drug resistance against chemotherapeutic
agents, and in the activation of anti-apoptotic pathways in
cancer cells. Molecules involved in these pathways have
been shown to activate the PI3K-AKT axis and NFκB,
as demonstrated by the use of a γ-secretase (GSI), and
Notch-1 inhibitors in pancreatic, colorectal and breast

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cancers [26–28]. Thus, it might be expected that drug
resistant clones, including Notch-expressing cells, may be
effectively eradicated by a single administration of fucosebound liposomes, resulting in early remission for patients
with AML.
It is noteworthy that Notch-1-expressing AML cells
were found in 90% of patients we examined in our study.
However, the role of Notch-1 in AML progression still
remains unclear. For instance, when GSI is administered
to AML patients, the efficacy of this drug is minimal,
indicating that Notch-1 is not a major player in driving
AML clones. Recently, it has been shown that Notch
mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in AML cells
via activation of Hairy/Enhancer of Split 1 (HES1),
suggesting the development of Notch agonists as a new
therapy [24].
As we have previously demonstrated, L-fucosemediated cell-targeting is a promising new therapeutic
strategy for cancer treatment [11]. Herein, we show
that the expression of CD33 and Notch-1 correlate in
the same leukemia cell lines, and that Notch-1 positive
leukemia cells are targeted by L-fucose-bound liposomes,
Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin particles were found to
inhibit the growth of Notch-1 positive cells in vitro and
in a mouse xenograft model, and suppressed Notch-1
positive, but not Notch-1 negative, AML cells derived
from patients. Our results suggest that fucose-targeting
therapy could be effective in increasing the survival of
patients with AML.

The lipid concentrations of Liposome-daunorubicin
and Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin were measured
using a Cholesterol E-test Wako Kit as described
previously[11].

Acute leukemia cells were obtained from patients
after informed consent was obtained in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and institutional
ethics committee. HL60, RPMI8226, KG1 and MOLT4
cells were obtained from the RIKEN Bioresource
center (Tsubuka, Japan). The cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% FBS, L-glutamine and 1%
penicillin-streptomycin. These cells were authenticated
by cytogenetics in 2013.

Measurement of daunorubicin and calculation of
daunorubicin concentration and encapsulation

The concentration of daunorubicin was
measured by absorbance at 485 nm. In brief, FucLiposome-daunorubicin was diluted 1,000-fold with a
methanol:chloroform (1:1) solution, and the concentration
of daunorubicin was determined by absorbance at 485 nm.
A calibration curve, with daunorubicin concentrations in
the range of 625 – 5000 ng/mL was run before the analysis
of each sample type.

ACC ATT TC -3': internal standard ß-actin: forward, 5′GCT CGT CGT CGA CAACGG CTC- 3′; reverse, 5′CAA ACA TGC TCT GGG TCA TCT TCT- 3′.

Flow cytometry analysis
Cells (1 x 105) were incubated with Fuc-LiposomeFAM or Liposome-FAM (lipid concentration: 4 µg/mL)
for 2 h. For the blocking assay, 1 x 105 cells were treated
with L-fucose for 30 min prior to adding Fuc-LiposomeFAM or Liposome-FAM. The mean fluorescence
intensity (MFI) was assessed on a FACScalibur with
CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA). For the detection of CD33 and Notch-1
expression, cell line samples (5 x 105 cells each) were
incubated with isotypic control, allophycocyanin (APC)conjugated anti-Notch-1 antibody (R & D systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) or FITC-conjugated anti-CD33
antibody (Miltenyl Biotec Bergisch Gladbach, Germany)
on ice for 30 min. After washing in PBS/0.05% BSA,
the cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckton
Dickinson).

Preparation of FAM and daunorubicin
encapsulated in liposomes
Preparation of FAM carrying liposomes has
been described previously [11]. Briefly, DPPC, Chol,
ganglioside, DCP, and DPPE were mixed at different
molar ratios, and cholic acid added to facilitate micelle
formation. The mixture was dissolved in methanol/
chloroform (1:1, v/v), and the solvent was evaporated
at 37°C to produce a lipid film, which was dried under
vacuum. For the daunorubicin preparation, a HSA solution
(HSA 20 mg/mL, 0.2 N NaOH) containing daunorubicin
(20 mg/mL) was added to the lipid film and sonicated to
obtain uniform micelles, which were then ultrafiltered
(molecular weight cutoff 10 kD; Amicon PM10, Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). Hydrophilization treatment and
L-fucose conjugation on the surface of liposomes were
carried out by methods modified from Yamazaki et al.
[29]. Aminated L-fucose was conjugated to the liposome
surface using DTSSP as described previously.

Intracellular distribution analysis of FAM
Cells were plated in Lab-Tek chambered
coverglasses at 1 x 104 cells/chamber. Fuc-LiposomeFAM or Liposome-FAM was added to cells at a final
FAM concentration of 4 ng/ml. Cells were cultured in
complete medium for 30 min, after which the medium
was replaced with fresh medium. At 30 min and 2 h
post-treatment, cells were washed twice with PBS and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room
temperature. After fixation, cells were washed three times
with PBS and exposed to Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent
with DAPI (Life Technologies) for 10 min to stain nuclei.
The subcellular localization of FAM was assessed by

Physicochemical characterization of
Fuc-Liposome-daunorubicin
The average particle size and zeta-potential of
liposomes were measured as described previously[11].

Cell proliferation assay
Human leukemia cell lines (2 x 104 cells/well)
were seeded into 24-well plates, and cultured for one
day in medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, 5% L-glutamine, and 1% antibiotics. Cells were
then incubated with different doses of Fuc-Liposomedaunorubicin. After 2 h incubation, cells were washed
twice with PBS and finally resuspended in medium
containing serum and antibiotics. After culture for 72 h,
a BrdU cell proliferation assay reagent (Cell Signaling,
Boston, MA, USA) was added and the assay performed
according to manufacturer’s instructions. Experiments
were performed in triplicate and repeated at least twice.

AML xenograft model and treatment schedule
In a subcutaneous model, 2 x 106HL60 cells were
inoculated to create a dorsal lesion (mice aged 4 to 6
weeks) and each was allowed to grow into a tumor 5 mm
in diameter. Tumor-bearing mice were randomly assigned
to one of the following groups (n = 6 mice per group):
no treatment, daunorubicin (1 mg/kg), F0-Liposomedaunorubicin (1 mg/kg), and F50-Liposome-daunorubicin
(1 mg/kg). Treatments were administered through tail
vein injection with a single dose of 100 μl of the abovementioned drugs, twice a week for three weeks. At 4, 8,
11, 15, 18, 22 and 25 days after transplantation, tumor
volumes were measured. For D-mannose pre-treatment in
all in vivo experiments, 5 mg of D-mannose was injected
through a tail vein 5 min prior to the administration of
agents as described previously [11].
These studies were carried out according to the
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of
the National Institutes of the Health. The protocols were
approved by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal
Experiments of Sapporo Medical University. All surgery
was performed under sodium pentobarbital anesthesia,
and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. All mice
underwent euthanasia when tumor volumes reached 20
mm in diameter.
