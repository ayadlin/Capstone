The malignant phenotype of chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) is due to the abnormal tyrosine kinase activity of
the BCR-ABL oncoprotein, which signals several downstream cell survival pathways, including phosphoinositide
3-kinase/AKT, signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2.
In patients with CML, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
are used to suppress the BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase,
resulting in impressive response rates. However, resistance
can occur, especially in acute-phase CML, through various
mechanisms. Here, we show that the glucocorticoidinduced leucine zipper protein (GILZ) modulates imatinib
and dasatinib resistance and suppresses tumor growth
by inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin
complex-2 (mTORC2)/AKT signaling pathway. In mouse
and human models, GILZ binds to mTORC2, but not to
mTORC1, inhibiting phosphorylation of AKT (at Ser473)
and activating FoxO3a-mediated transcription of the
pro-apoptotic protein Bim; these results demonstrate
that GILZ is a key inhibitor of the mTORC2 pathway.
Furthermore, CD34 þ stem cells isolated from relapsing
CML patients underwent apoptosis and showed inhibition
of mTORC2 after incubation with glucocorticoids and
imatinib. Our ﬁndings provide new mechanistic insights
into the role of mTORC2 in BCR-ABL þ cells and indicate
that regulation by GILZ may inﬂuence TKI sensitivity.

phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathways, all of which affect cell
viability, cell-cycle progression and leukemogenesis
(Steelman et al., 2008). mTOR acts through its inclusion
in two distinct signaling complexes: mTOR complex 1
(mTORC1/Raptor), which responds to growth signals
and nutrients, and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2/Rictor),
which primarily responds to growth signals (Guertin and
Sabatini, 2007; Zeng et al., 2007; Kharas et al., 2008).
Inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin can result in
increased mTORC2 activity, which results in increased
AKT activity and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways.
Recent data have indicated that the mTORC2 complex is
activated in BCR-ABL þ cells and has an important role
in growth and survival (Carayol et al., 2010; Mancini
et al., 2010; Vakana et al., 2010). Inhibition of mTORC1
by rapamycin may result in an increase in mTORC2
activity, leading to increased AKT activity and activation of anti-apoptotic pathways; only drugs that target
both mTORC2 and mTORC1 have an anti-leukemic
effect. Therefore, mTORC2 seems to be a key factor in
BCR-ABL-induced oncogenesis, and factors that regulate mTORC2 may also limit the downstream effects of
BCR-ABL signaling.
The glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (GILZ)
protein is an essential mediator of glucocorticoid action
(Ayroldi and Riccardi, 2009). GILZ has been studied
extensively in T cells, and it has been shown to have
both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties (D’Adamio
et al., 1997; Asselin-Labat et al., 2004; Delﬁno et al.,
2004). GILZ also inhibits two of the main pathways
involved in oncogenesis, namely the nuclear factor-kB
pathway and the Raf/Ras/ERK pathway (Ayroldi et al.,
2001, 2002). In addition, when GILZ binds to Ras/Raf,
AKT phosphorylation is reduced, suggesting that GILZ
may also affect the AKT survival pathway (Ayroldi
et al., 2007). However, the role of GILZ in BCR-ABL þ
cells has not been evaluated.
In this paper, we investigated the role of GILZ on
AKT activation in BCR-ABL þ cells. We found that
some imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL þ cells have reduced
expression of GILZ and that increasing GILZ expression by transfection or by glucocorticoid treatment
overcame imatinib resistance and suppressed BCRABL þ tumor growth through mTORC2 inhibition.
We also demonstrate that GILZ interacts with
mTORC2, inhibiting P-AKT (Ser473) and activating
FoxO3a-mediated transcription of the pro-apoptotic

protein Bim. These results establish GILZ as a key
inhibitor of the mTORC2 pathway in BCR-ABL þ cells.

Results
GILZ expression overcomes imatinib resistance
We investigated whether the GILZ protein was expressed in different BCR-ABL þ leukemia cell lines. In
the DA1-3b/M0 mouse cell line (referred to as ‘M0’
hereafter) originally obtained after transfection of BCR-

ABL into myeloid DA1 cells, BCR-ABL expression was
associated with decreased GILZ expression (Figure 1a).
The imatinib-resistant cell line DA1-3b/M1 (referred to
as ‘M1’ hereafter), which was derived from M0 cells
after prolonged selection with imatinib and carries an
E255K BCR-ABL mutation, and the DA1-3b/d365 cell
line (referred to as ‘d365’ hereafter), which was derived
from M0 cells injected in mice and isolated after 1 year
of tumor dormancy and harbors partial resistance to
imatinib, also exhibited decreased GILZ expression
(Figure 1a) (Saudemont et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008).
Although GILZ protein expression was decreased,

mice injected with Void cells (P ¼ 0.001, Log-Rank test). The graphs represent mean±s.d. of three separate experiments performed in

GILZ mRNA levels were not, indicating that the
mechanism of decreased GILZ expression occurs at
the post-transcriptional level (Supplementary Figure
S1a). Dexamethasone was still able to induce GILZ
mRNA in M0 and M1 cells, showing that these
cells remained sensitive to glucocorticoids (Supplementary Figure S1b). MG132 and epoxomicin administered
for various lengths of time (Figure 1a, right panel) at
various concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1c)
restored GILZ expression, conﬁrming that the proteasome has a role in regulating GILZ expression,
as previously reported in thymocytes (Delﬁno et al.,
2010).
We explored the effects of increasing GILZ expression
by stably transfecting a vector expressing GILZ or an
empty vector into cells (referred to as ‘GILZ-transfected’ and ‘Void-transfected’, respectively). Forced
GILZ expression through stable plasmid transfection
led to higher levels of GILZ than those observed in the
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1d). In M1 and d365
cells, imatinib induced massive apoptosis in GILZtransfected cells but not in Void-transfected cells
(Figure 1b). Similar results were also obtained with the
human K562-r cell line, which was originally generated
by long-term selection with imatinib; the mechanism of
resistance in K562-r cells is not yet known (Pocaly et al.,
2008; Figures 1a and c).
Staurosporine (STS), another tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets a different spectrum of kinases
than imatinib, also induced apoptosis in GILZ-transfected but not in Void-transfected M1 cells (Supplementary Figures S2a–c) and had no effect on BCR-ABL
phosphorylation (Supplementary Figure S2d), suggest-

ing that GILZ may have a more general role in
facilitating apoptosis.
These results were conﬁrmed in vivo in our mouse
model (Figure 1d). Compared with mice injected with
Void-transfected M1 cells, fewer mice injected with
GILZ-transfected M1 cells and treated with imatinib or
vehicle developed leukemia. This result was conﬁrmed
by the absence of dormant tumor cells in mice killed 9 or
12 months after injection, as reported previously
(Saudemont and Quesnel, 2004).
Similar results were observed using the double
imatinib/dasatinib-resistant line DA1-3b/M2 (referred
to as ‘M2’), which carries an additional T315I mutation,
which confers broad resistance to TKIs. Dexamethasone
was able to induce GILZ mRNA in M2 cells (Supplementary Figure S1b). Ectopic GILZ expression did not
modify resistance to dasatinib but restored imatinib and
STS sensitivity (Figure 2a), and these results were
conﬁrmed in vivo (Figure 2b). Mice injected with
GILZ-transfected M2 cells and treated with imatinib
manifested delayed leukogenesis when compared with
mice injected with GILZ-transfected cells treated with
dasatinib or mice injected with Void-transfected M2
cells and treated with either imatinib or dasatinib.
Taken together, our results suggest that GILZ sensitizes
cells to the off-target effects of imatinib, and that GILZ
overexpression suppresses BCR-ABL oncogenicity, even
when the tumor has become TKI resistant.

injected mice (Po0.0015, Log-Rank test).

related to the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane
potential (Figure 1b). We conﬁrmed apoptosis based on
sub-G1 DNA content and presence of cleaved caspase 3
(Supplementary Figures S3a and b). Furthermore,
inhibition of apoptosis by the pan-caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk indicated that caspases were involved (Supplementary Figure S3c). In M1 cells, analysis of Bcl-2
family members indicated that GILZ overexpression
resulted in downregulation of Bcl-2 protein and
upregulation of Bim mRNA and protein levels but
had no effect on the parental BCR-ABL DA1 cell line
(Figures 3a and b). These results were conﬁrmed by the
absence of increased cell death induced by imatinib in
GILZ-transfected DA1 cells (Supplementary Figure
S3d) and suggested that induction of cell death by
GILZ is dependent on BCR-ABL. Similar results were
observed in K562-r cells (Figure 3c).
Imatinib did not further modify Bcl-xL, Bcl-2 or Bim
expression in GILZ-transfected M1 cells or in Voidtransfected M1 cells (Figure 3d). In GILZ-transfected
cells, imatinib downregulated Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic
factor that has been identiﬁed as a BCR-ABL-dependent target in CML (Aichberger et al., 2005). Therefore,
by increasing Bim expression, GILZ predisposes imatinib-resistant cells to imatinib-induced apoptosis by
changing the Mcl-1/Bim ratio.
GILZ inhibits the P-AKT (Ser473) pathway
in BCR-ABL þ cells
The above results demonstrate that transfection of GILZ
alone affects the protein level of Bim. The transcriptional
upregulation of Bim is mediated by FoxO3a (Essaﬁ et al.,
2005), and FoxO3a is inactivated by phosphoinositide 3kinase/AKT/mTOR signaling (de Jong et al., 1997; Dijkers
et al., 2002). GILZ did not directly affect the kinase activity
of BCR-ABL and did not affect signal transducer and
activator of transcription 5 and CRKL, the downstream
effectors of the BCR-ABL pathway (Figure 4a). Using
western blotting and a PathScan sandwich enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay kit, we found that in BCR-ABL þ
M1 cells, GILZ overexpression strongly downregulated
phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473), a speciﬁc substrate of
mTORC2 (Sarbassov et al., 2005; Figures 4b and g).
Consequently, phosphorylation of the downstream effector
of AKT FoxO3a (Ser253 and Thr32) was also decreased
(Figure 4b; Hietakangas and Cohen, 2007). In contrast, in
the parental BCR-ABL DA1 cell line, AKT was not
phosphorylated on Ser473, conﬁrming that AKT (Ser473)
is a downstream target of BCR-ABL (Figure 4b; Sharma
et al., 2006). The levels of P-FoxO3a (Ser253 and Thr32)
and total AKT were not altered, and GILZ overexpression
did not modify these effects. In parental DA1 cells, GILZ
overexpression also reduced the phosphorylation of both
the p44 and p42 forms of ERK (Figure 4b), as published
previously (Ayroldi et al., 2007). In contrast, in BCRABL þ M1 cells, GILZ expression did not affect ERK
phosphorylation or that of its downstream substrate, Bad
(Ser112) (Figures 4b and c).
AKT may also be phosphorylated on Thr308 by
3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1);
this step is required for Bad (Ser136) phosphorylation and

mTORC1 activity towards its downstream substrate S6
(Ly et al., 2003). GILZ overexpression did not affect the
levels of P-Bad (Ser136), P-S6, P-Mdm2 (Figure 4c) or Mcl1 (Figures 3a and c). GILZ overexpression also failed to
affect AKT Thr308 phosphorylation in DA1 cells (Supplementary Figure S4). These results suggest that GILZ alone
does not interfere with the PDK1/AKT/mTORC1 pathway
or with the MEK/ERK pathway (Wang et al., 2005; Mills
et al., 2008; Ikenoue et al., 2009). Similar results were
observed in human K562-r cells (Figure 4d). mTORC1 can
differentially affect S6K and 4E-BP phosphorylation, but
we did not observe changes in the phosphorylation of S6K
or 4E-BP in K562-r and M1 cells overexpressing GILZ
(Figures 4e and f). mTORC2 has also been reported to
phosphorylate protein kinase C-alpha (PKCa) and serumand glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK). GILZ-overexpressing K562-r and M1 cells showed reduced protein
kinase C-alpha (PKCa) and SGK phosphorylation,

conﬁrming that GILZ-mediated inhibition of mTORC2
affected several pathways downstream of mTORC2
(Figures 4e and f). In summary, our data provide evidence
that GILZ inhibits mTORC2 activity in BCR-ABL þ cells.
Therefore, we next investigated whether GILZ exerts its
effects by directly interacting with mTORC2.
GILZ binding to mTORC2 inhibits mTORC2 activity
Using mTOR as bait for an immunoprecipitation, we
found that GILZ was a component of mTORC2
(Figure 5a). GILZ co-precipitated with mTOR, Rictor

and HSP70 (all of which are mTORC2 components) but
not with Raptor (an mTORC1 component). Furthermore, Rictor co-precipitated with mTOR, HSP70 and
GILZ but not with Raptor (Martin et al., 2008). We were
able detect an endogenous GILZ–mTORC2 interaction
in M1 cells treated with dexamethasone (Figure 5b).
Similar results were observed in GILZ-transfected K562r cells, indicating that the GILZ–mTORC2 interaction is
not cell line speciﬁc (Figure 5c). Immunoprecipitation
using mSin1, a component that is speciﬁc to mTORC2,
as bait demonstrated that GILZ bound all mTORC2

complexes (Figure 5d; Frias et al., 2006). Like the
Raptor–mTOR interaction, the Rictor–mTOR interaction is sensitive to Triton X-100 but is stable in CHAPScontaining buffers (Sarbassov et al., 2004). The GILZ–
Rictor interaction was not destabilized in the presence of
Triton X-100, suggesting that GILZ bound Rictor
preferentially and independently of mTOR (Figure 5e).
Silencing of mSin1 or Rictor expression led to a
signiﬁcant reduction in the amount of GILZ associated
with mTORC2, suggesting that GILZ interaction with
mTORC2 requires Rictor and/or mSin1 (Figures 6a and b).
As mTORC2 is known to be sensitive to prolonged
rapamycin treatment, and because rapamycin enhances
the effects of imatinib, we performed mTOR and Raptor
immunoprecipitations in lysates from GILZ-transfected
M1 cells treated with rapamycin for 24 h (Mohi et al.,
2004). Rapamycin profoundly affected the interaction
Oncogene

between GILZ and mTOR complexes (Figure 6c).
Furthermore, incubation of puriﬁed GILZ with
mTORC2 inhibited AKT (Ser473) phosphorylation in
an in vitro kinase assay (Figure 6d). This was conﬁrmed
using myc-tagged recombinant human GILZ and
recombinant, active human AKT1 (Figure 6e). Taken
together, these data suggest that GILZ is a novel
mTORC2 component that acts to inhibit mTOR kinase
activity in BCR-ABL þ cells.
Modulation of imatinib resistance by GCs in BCR-ABL þ
myeloid cells
As the ectopic expression of GILZ in imatinib-resistant,
BCR-ABL þ myeloid cells was able to induce apoptosis in
combination with imatinib or STS, we investigated
whether glucocorticoids (GCs), which are the main
physiological inducers of GILZ expression, could also

modulate imatinib resistance. In mouse and human cell
lines and in CD34 þ cells from six relapsing CML patients
(Table 1), sequential treatment with dexamethasone (a
potent GC agonist) followed by imatinib modestly
reduced cell viability in M1, M2 and K562-r cells and in
ﬁve of six patients when compared with treatment with
imatinib alone (Figures 7a–c and e). M1 and M2 cell lines
were also slightly sensitive to treatment with dexamethasone alone (Figures 7a and c). This effect was associated
with decreased phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and
increased expression of BimEL and BimS (Figure 7d,
Supplementary Figure S5). Therefore, GCs may modulate
apoptosis in BCR-ABL þ myeloid cells.
GILZ small-interfering RNA treatment only partially
reduced GILZ expression and modestly inhibited the
mortality caused by sequential treatment (Supplementary Figure S6). Thus, GILZ likely contributes to
dexamethasone-induced mortality, but we cannot rule
out the possibility that other pathways may be involved.

BCR-ABL þ cells underscore the importance of AKT
regulation (Zeng et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2008). We
investigated GILZ as a possible regulator of BCR-ABL
activity and found that GILZ protein expression was
decreased in some BCR-ABL þ cell lines (likely through
proteasome-mediated degradation), and in a cell line
derived from dormant BCR-ABL þ cells. It was not clear
whether this downregulation resulted from imatinib
resistance mechanisms, because K562-r and d365 cells
showed reduced expression, but M1 cells did not. However,
these ﬁndings suggest that GILZ may have a role in

BCR-ABL signaling. Restoration of GILZ expression
re-sensitized resistant cells to imatinib, upregulated Bim
expression and decreased Bcl-2 expression in human and
mouse cells ectopically expressing BCR-ABL. Bim has a
crucial role in imatinib-mediated cell death (van Delft
et al., 2006). It belongs to the BH3-only family of proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins and antagonizes prosurvival
Bcl-2 proteins. Drugs mimicking BH3-only proteins
trigger Bax/Bak-mediated apoptosis and may overcome
chemoresistance by binding tightly to anti-apoptotic
Bcl-2 proteins. Our data suggest that enhanced GILZ

mTORC2 inhibition by GILZ

expression sensitizes TKI-resistant cells to apoptosis
through Bim. Moreover, apoptosis induced by GILZ in
imatinib- and dasatinib-resistant cells indicates that
imatinib may suppress unidentiﬁed kinases other than
BCR-ABL, leading to its synergy with GILZ. This
hypothesis was also suggested by the ﬁnding that MCL1
expression decreased only when GILZ-transfected cells
were exposed to imatinib, suggesting that the same
synergy between GILZ and imatinib may also induce
apoptosis through modiﬁcation of the Bim/MCL1 ratio.
STS, another TKI that targets a different spectrum
of kinases than imatinib, also induced apoptosis in
GILZ-transfected cells and had no effect on BCRABL phosphorylation, suggesting that synergy with
GILZ-induced apoptosis is not restricted to imatinib.
Therefore, GILZ is a critical regulator of apoptosis in
BCR-ABL þ cells.
As Bim was upregulated in GILZ-transfected cells, we
investigated whether the pathways that control Bim
expression are regulated by GILZ. Bim expression and
activity is modulated by numerous factors, including
ERK and FoxO3a. FoxO3a is a member of the FOXO
subfamily of forkhead transcription factors that regulate
cell survival and apoptosis. In the presence of survival
factors, AKT is phosphorylated and activated and in
turn phosphorylates FoxO3a, leading to its association
with 14-3-3 proteins, nuclear exclusion, as well as
retention and degradation in the cytoplasm. Inhibition
of AKT phosphorylation leads to FoxO3a dephosphorylation, nuclear translocation and activation of Bim
transcription, resulting in apoptosis. In BCR-ABL þ
cells transfected with GILZ, decreased phosphorylation
of FoxO3a and increased mRNA and protein expression
of Bim was observed. ERK-mediated phosphorylation
of BimEL has been reported to promote its dissociation
from MCL1, leading to proteasome-mediated degradation of BimEL. However, in our experiments, the ectopic
expression of GILZ in BCR-ABL þ cells did not inhibit
signaling through the ERK pathway. Therefore, Bim
expression is modulated through phosphorylation of
FoxO3a in GILZ-expressing cells.
GILZ possesses multiple functions and can affect
ERK, AP-1 and nuclear factor-kB signaling (Ayroldi
and Riccardi, 2009). Here, we show that in addition to
these previously reported effects, GILZ inhibits
mTORC2/AKT activity in the presence of BCR-ABL.
In BCR-ABL DA1 cells, GILZ decreased ERK activity,
as previously reported in other BCR-ABL cell types
(Ayroldi et al., 2007), but did not affect FoxO3a
phosphorylation. However, in BCR-ABL þ cells, GILZ
inhibited the AKT pathway but not the ERK pathway.
In BCR-ABL þ cells, survival depends more on the AKT
pathway than on the ERK pathway (Yu et al., 2002;
Kawauchi et al., 2003). Therefore, GILZ-mediated
inhibition of AKT is more likely to induce apoptosis
in BCR-ABL þ cells. However, the mechanism underlying the differential inhibitory effects of GILZ in BCRABL þ and BCR-ABL cells remains unclear.
The mammalian target of rapamycin is a component
of the phosphatase and tensin homolog/phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway (Essaﬁ et al.,

2005; Polak and Hall, 2006; Sabatini, 2006; Toker and
Yoeli-Lerner, 2006; Hietakangas and Cohen, 2007;
Kharas et al., 2008). Our study indicates that GILZ
inhibits the downstream functions of mTORC2/P-AKT
(Ser473), including FoxO3a, PKCa and SGK phosphorylation, but does not affect the mTORC1 pathway.
We demonstrated that GILZ bound mTORC2, but not
mTORC1, as illustrated by its co-immunoprecipitation
with mTOR, Rictor, mSin1 and HSP70. Our results
also suggest that Rictor is essential for GILZ binding to mTORC2, but we cannot rule out that other
proteins in this complex may be involved. Taken
together, these results establish GILZ as an inhibitor
of mTORC2.
GILZ is induced by GCs, and treatment of TKIresistant BCR-ABL þ cells with GCs followed by
imatinib resulted in apoptosis. GC-mediated induction
of GILZ also modulated the mTORC2/AKT/FoxO3a/
Bim pathway. Although their effects have been more
widely studied in lymphoid cells, GCs can also induce
cell death or differentiation in the myeloid–monocyte
lineage and have been shown to induce apoptosis in
AML cells, including BCR-ABL þ cells (Miyoshi et al.,
1997; Schmidt et al., 2001; Dayyani et al., 2003;
Hicsonmez, 2006). Although several pathways may be
responsible for GC-induced apoptosis in myeloid cells,
our results suggest that GILZ may have a role in vivo, at
least in BCR-ABL þ cells. In addition to GCs, several
factors have been reported to be inducers of GILZ
expression, including interleukin-10, interleukin-15,
stem cell factor (SCF) and transforming growth
factor-b, suggesting that stimuli from the microenvironment may sensitize leukemia cells to apoptosis through
GILZ (Berrebi et al., 2003; Kolbus et al., 2003; Perez
et al., 2005; Cohen et al., 2006). GC-induced apoptosis
has also been shown to be GILZ dependent in multiple
myeloma, suggesting that GILZ may have broader roles
(Grugan et al., 2008).
In summary, we show that GILZ primes leukemia
cells with several types of TKI resistance for death
through inhibition of the mTORC2 complex, which
leads to Bim upregulation (Figure 8). Therefore, GILZ
seems to be an essential regulator of BCR-ABL.

Figure 8 Summary of GILZ’s regulatory effects on the AKT
pathway in BCR-ABL cells. (a) BCR-ABL activates AKT through
PI3K and mTORC2. Phosphorylation of AKT at Ser473 inhibits
Bim expression and apoptosis through Foxo3A. (b) GILZ interacts
with mTORC2 and reduces AKT (Ser473) phosphorylation,
leading to Bim expression and apoptosis.

Cell lines
The leukemic DA1-3b/M0 p210BCRABL cell line (referred to
here as ‘M0’) and the DA1-3b/C3HeOuJ mouse model have
been described previously (Saudemont and Quesnel, 2004;
Saudemont et al., 2005). We recently reported the generation
of the DA1-3b/M1 cell line (referred to here as ‘M1’) carrying
an E255K mutation and the double imatinib/dasatinibresistant line DA1-3b/M2 (referred to here as ‘M2’) with an
additional T315I mutation (Liu et al., 2008). Using the same
model, we previously described a dormant cell line (DA1-3b/
d365, referred to here as ‘d365’) that persisted for a year in
mice without causing symptoms and developed resistance to
imatinib that was independent of BCR-ABL mutation
(Saudemont et al., 2007). These cell lines provide a model to
examine imatinib resistance and mechanisms necessary to
overcome it (Liu et al., 2008). Imatinib (1 mM) was added
continuously to maintain selective pressure. BCR-ABL parental DA1 cells (obtained from and established by Ihle (1985))
were maintained in the same medium supplemented with 4 ng/
ml mouse interleukin-3 (PeproTech, London, UK). The
human imatinib-resistant K562 line (K562-r) has been
described previously (Pocaly et al., 2008). The identity of each
cell line was authenticated based on BCR-ABL expression,
sequencing analyses and imatinib IC50 determinations before
beginning the experiments.
Primary CML samples
Bone marrow or peripheral blood was obtained from imatinibresistant patients during routine blood withdrawal. Donors
provided informed consent in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki. This study was approved by the Institutional
Review Board at the Tumorotheque du Centre Hospitalier et
Universitaire de Lille (Centre de Biologie, Lille, France).
CD34 þ cell separation (>95% purity) was carried out using
positive-selection magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn,
Oncogene

CA, USA). Primary cells were cultured in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
20% fetal calf serum, 200 pg/ml stem cell factor, 10 ng/ml
interleukin-6 and 200 pg/ml granulocyte colony-stimulating
factor (all from PeproTech).
Plasmids and small-interfering RNA transfection
Human and mouse GILZ cDNAs were cloned into the
pVITRO eGFP plasmid (InvivoGen, Toulouse, France).
Stably transfected cells were termed ‘Void’ or ‘GILZ’. The
mouse Rictor expression plasmid was kindly provided by
Michael N Hall (Jacinto et al., 2004). The mouse Rictor-,
mSIN1-, GILZ- and AKT-speciﬁc small-interfering RNAs and
the scrambled control small-interfering RNA were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.
Measurement of AKT phosphorylation
Total AKT1 and P-AKT1 (Ser473) were analyzed using a
PathScan sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit
(Cell Signaling Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
In vivo studies
Seven- to eight-week-old C3H/HeOuJ female mice (Charles
River Laboratories, Lyon, France) were injected intraperitoneally with 1  106 Void- or GILZ-transfected M1 cells.
Treatment was initiated 24 h after cell injection and consisted
of an intraperitoneal injection of phosphate-buffered saline
(vehicle) or imatinib (50 mg/kg) twice daily. Imatinib injections
were terminated after 1 month because of the death of all
mice injected with Void-transfected cells. Quantiﬁcation of
residual disease in surviving mice was performed as described
previously (Saudemont and Quesnel, 2004). For M2 experiments, the same protocol was followed, except that treatment consisted of daily intraperitoneal injections of imatinib
(75 mg/kg) or dasatinib (15 mg/kg) resuspended in dimethyl
sulfoxide/polyethylene glycol 300 (vol/vol). All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Care Ethical Committee
CEEA.NPDC (Agreement no. AF-03-2008).
Co-immunoprecipitation and western blot analyses
Whole cell extracts were prepared under non-denaturing
conditions using CHAPS lysis buffer (0.3% CHAPS in
phosphate-buffered saline). When speciﬁed, cell extracts were
also prepared using a buffer containing Triton X-100 (Cell
Signaling Technologies), which disrupts the interaction between mTOR and Rictor (Sarbassov et al., 2004).
In vitro mTORC2 kinase assays
The effect of GILZ on the ability of mTORC2 to phosphorylate AKT on Ser473 was determined using the following two
different methods:
A previously described method (Sancak et al., 2007;
Peterson et al., 2009): In brief, the mTORC2 complex was
puriﬁed by lysing M1 cells in CHAPS buffer, and immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-Rictor antibody.
The GILZ protein was puriﬁed from GILZ-transfected M1
cells as described above, except for the use of TBS wash buffer
containing 0.2% Tween and lysis buffer containing Triton
X-100 (Cell Signaling Technologies).Puriﬁed human recombinant proteins (GILZ and AKT1): To assess the inhibitory
effect of GILZ on phosphorylation of AKT by mTORC2, we
preincubated immunoprecipitated human Rictor (5 ml) with
various concentration of myc-tagged human recombinant
GILZ (Origine; 0, 300, 600 and 900 ng) for 30 min at 30 1C.

Active recombinant human AKT1 (BPS Biosciences, San
Diego, CA, USA; 150 ng) was then added, and the mixture was
incubated for 20 min at 30 1C before the addition of 200 mM
ATP for 20 min at 30 1C in a kinase buffer (Cell Signaling
Technologies). The reaction was terminated by addition of
20 ml of 2  SDS sample buffer to 20 ml of the reaction mixture
and heating at 95 1C for 5 min.

Quantitative real-time PCR
Real-time PCR analysis of the BIM transcript was performed
using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
Bedford, MA, USA). The mouse BIM sense primer was 50 CACCTGCTGTGTGCTTCCTA-30 , and the antisense primer
was 50 -GCTGGCCTAAAGCAGTGAAC-30 . The mouse
GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase) sense
primer was 50 -CAGCTTCGGCACATATTTCA-30 , and the
antisense primer was 50 -TCGTTCACTCCCATGACAAA-30 .
Real-time PCR analysis of the GILZ transcript was performed
using the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Applied Biosystems), as recommended by the manufacturer.
Cell viability and cell-cycle analysis
Apoptosis was analyzed by determining the mitochondrial
transmembrane potential, which was quantiﬁed based on
CMXRos retention. MitoTracker Red CMXRos was purchased from Molecular Probes. When speciﬁed, cell viability
was also analyzed using the MTT assay (Promega, Madison,

WI, USA). Cell-cycle analysis and sub-diploid populations
were analyzed using propidium iodide staining and conventional techniques.
Statistics
All data were analyzed using Sigma Stat 3.1 software (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA).
