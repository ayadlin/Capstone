ABSTRACT
Dysregulated expression of translation initiation factors has been associated
with carcinogenesis, but underlying mechanisms remains to be fully understood.
Here we show that eIF4H (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4H), an activator
of the RNA helicase eIF4A, is overexpressed in lung carcinomas and predictive
of response to chemotherapy. In lung cancer cells, depletion of eIF4H enhances
sensitization to chemotherapy, decreases cell migration and inhibits tumor growth
in vivo, in association with reduced translation of mRNA encoding cell-proliferation
(c-Myc, cyclin D1) angiogenic (FGF-2) and anti-apoptotic factors (CIAP-1, BCL-xL).
Conversely, each isoform of eIF4H acts as an oncogene in NIH3T3 cells by stimulating
transformation, invasion, tumor growth and resistance to drug-induced apoptosis
together with increased translation of IRES-containing or structured 5′UTR mRNAs.
These results demonstrate that eIF4H plays a crucial role in translational control and
can promote cellular transformation by preferentially regulating the translation of
potent growth and survival factor mRNAs, indicating that eIF4H is a promising new
molecular target for cancer therapy.

Translation initiation is dependent on the spatial
and temporal interactions between many eIFs (eukaryotic
translation Initiation Factors). First, a ribosome is recruited
to the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of the transcript.
This involves the eIF4F complex which is composed of
three initiation factors: the cap-binding protein eIF4E,
the prototypical DEAD-box helicase eIF4A and the large

INTRODUCTION

to undergo rapid growth. This requires a sustained increase

scaffold protein eIF4G that is able to directly interact with the
eIF4E and eIF4A proteins (Figure 1A) [3–5]. Once the eIF4F
complex has been recruited, eIF4A unwinds the inhibitory
RNA secondary structure within the 5′UTR (Figure 1A),
increasing the ability of the 40 S ribosomal subunit to bind to
the mRNA. By itself, eIF4A displays a weak ATP-dependent
helicase activity, but this is enhanced through a functional
interaction with either eIF4H or eIF4B [6–12]. Neither eIF4B
nor eIF4H exhibits a helicase activity in the absence of eIF4A
but they promote the ATPase [7, 13–15], RNA-binding
[7, 10, 12, 15, 16], and helicase activities [12–14, 17] of
eIF4A. This allows eIF4A to efficiently unwind the secondary
structures in the 5′UTR, to promote the efficient scanning of
the ribosome up to the start codon. eIF4A-mediated RNA
unwinding appears to be necessary for ribosome recruitment
even for mRNA with few secondary structures [17]. Recently,
it was demonstrated that the eIF4A/eIF4H complex can
repetitively unwind RNA hairpins by transitioning eIF4A
between an active and inactive conformation using energy
from ATP hydrolysis. The complex can be inactivated using
a specific inhibitor that is able to lock eIF4A in its inactive
conformation [18].
As a translation initiation factor eIF4H plays an
important role within the cell, yet it has not been wellcharacterized compared to some of the other eIFs. eIF4H
has two transcript variants as a result of alternative
splicing, leading to the expression of two protein isoforms
of 25 and 27 kDa. These share significant sequence
homology with eIF4B. The function of eIF4B depends
on its phosphorylation (on Ser422) by the ribosomal
S6 kinase through a Rapamycin-sensitive pathway and
several studies have shown the importance of eIF4B
Ser422 phosphorylation for the initiation of cap-dependent
translation [19, 20–22]. Interestingly, eIF4B and eIF4H
hold homologous RNA recognition motif (RRM) domains,
however eIF4H lacks the carboxy-terminal region
containing the phosphorylation site, suggesting that eIF4H
may be constitutively active. The eIF4H gene is located
within the Williams-Beuren Syndrome critical genomic
region. This pathology is an autosomal dominant disorder
that results from a hemizygous deletion of sequences on
chromosome 7q11.23, including the eIF4H gene region. The
clinical outcome of this syndrome includes cardiovascular,
renal, dysmorphologic and ophthalmic abnormalities as well
as neurological and cognitive disorders. eIF4H-deficient
knockout mouse harbors growth defects, body weight loss,
brain abnormalities, altered neuronal morphology and
several behavior anomalies. This demonstrates that eIF4H
depletion may contribute to certain deficiencies associated
with Williams-Beuren Syndrome [23].
Recent studies have implicated eIFs in the
progression of various types of cancer. eIF4A was shown
to be an oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
(T-ALL) where it is required for the translation of
transcripts with 5′UTRs that can form G-quadruplexes [24].
In addition, eIF4B was reported to increase the synthesis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of proteins associated with enhanced diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma cell survival [25]. The 27 KDa eIF4H isoform
was also found to be overexpressed in human colorectal
and esophagus cancer tissues [26], where the silencing of
only the long eIF4H isoform inhibited proliferation and
induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells, suggesting that
this isoform specifically contributes to cell proliferation
and carcinogenesis. Nevertheless, the exact role of eIF4H
in tumorigenesis and the molecular mechanisms involved
are unknown. In this study, we have investigated the role of
eIF4H in cellular transformation and its physiological role
in mRNA translation both by overexpression of the two
eIF4H isoforms in NIH3T3 cells and downregulation of the
isoforms by RNA interference in lung cancer cells.

RESULTS
eIF4H isoform expression in lung tumors
We first investigated eIF4H expression in various tumor
types using a high-density multiple organ tumor and normal
tissue array, which contains 18 types of tumor alongside
normal controls (MC5003, Biomax, US). Given that eIF4H
was specifically highly expressed in many lung tumor tissue
(Supplementary Figure S2A– S2D) but was undetectable or
very low expressed in all normal lung tissue (Supplementary
Figure S2E– S2G) we focus our study on lung tumors.
Alternative splicing of the eIF4H gene generates two
transcript variants producing 25 kDa and 27 kDa protein
products, thus we investigated their expression levels in
lung tumors. For this purpose, total protein lysates were
prepared from 12 matched samples of lung tumor (T)
and adjacent normal tissue (N). We established that the
expression levels of both eIF4H isoforms was significantly
increased in lung carcinomas compared to corresponding
healthy tissue (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S2H).
The expression of eIF4A was also slightly increased in lung
tumor patient samples, while there was no difference in the
levels of eIF4B and PABP. eIF4H total protein expression in
these tumors (Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure S2H) was
confirmed by immunohistochemistry using histological
sections of tumor (T) and adjacent normal tissue (N) (Figure
1C and Supplementary Figure S2I).
We then performed eIF4H immunohistochemical
detection on a small cell lung carcinoma tissue microarray
(TMA; described in [27]). Positive eIF4H levels were
associated with a lack of objective response (OR) in patients
that received etoposide and cisplatin doublet chemotherapy.
Indeed, in the patient group with no OR to treatment based
on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria, only 20% of samples did not express eIF4H, while
58.1% of patients in the group with OR showed no eIF4H
staining (Figure 1D). These findings indicate that eIF4H
expression may serve as a new molecular marker for
predicting the response to etoposide and cisplatin therapy.
No significant correlation between the expression of eIF4H

first assessed the effect of eIF4H depletion on cisplatin
or etoposide chemoresistance in vitro in A549 cells. As
shown in Figure 2B, after 8 hours of cisplatin or etoposide
treatment, eIF4H-kd cells displayed increased caspase
3/7 activity compared to control shRNA-transfected cells.
Similar results were obtained for HeLa cells treated with
cisplatin (Supplementary Figure S3B). We also tested an
alternative apoptotic response pathway by using western
blotting to examine poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)
cleavage. Compared to control cells, eIF4H knockdown
resulted in increased PARP cleavage in A549 cells treated
with cisplatin or etoposide (Figure 2C). We next investigated
the effect of eIF4H depletion on cell proliferation and cell
cycle progression. Upon eIF4H silencing, cell proliferation
in vitro under low serum conditions (Figure 2D) was
significantly reduced. Similar results were obtained with
HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S3C). eIF4H silenced
cells showed a reduction in the percentage of cells in
G2/M and accumulation of cells in G1 phase (respectively
82% and 82,7% versus 68,1% in control cells) indicating
that eIF4H facilitates cell proliferation under low serum
conditions (Figure 2E and 2F). Upon eIF4H silencing, cell
migration (Figure 2G) was also significantly reduced.
Finally, the consequence of eIF4H depletion on lung
tumor growth was assessed in a subcutaneous xenograft
model. As shown in Figure 2H, eIF4H knockdown
significantly inhibited A549 cell tumor growth compared
with control groups (P < 0.001 at day 35). Similar results
were obtained with HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S3D).
Interestingly, upon immunofluorescence staining
with CD31, we observed that angiogenesis was highly
affected in engrafted A549 eIF4H knockdown cells
compare to control A549 control cells (Supplementary
Figure S4). Notably, density of CD31-positive vessels
as well as pericyte coverage (α-SMA1+) was higher in
control compare to eIF4H knockdown tumors.
Taken together, these data indicate that eIF4H
expression not only enhances the resistance of tumoral
cells to chemotherapeutic drugs but also promotes tumor
growth and angiogenesis in nude mice.

proliferation under low serum conditions (1% FCS)
(Figure 3B and Supplementary Figure S5B) but also
increased the number of cells in G2/M and reduced the
percentage of cells in G1 phase (respectively 63% and
67,8% versus 86,3% in control cells) (Figure 3C and 3D)
and stimulated anchorage-independent cell growth based
on cell colony formation in soft agar (Figure 3E and
Supplementary Figure S5C).
We then evaluated the effect of eIF4H isoform
overexpression on cell migration using both Boyden
chamber or wound–healing assays. The number of
migratory cells increased dramatically (more than 25 fold
after 6 hours) in NIH3T3 cells expressing either eIF4H
isoform (Figure 3F and Supplementary Figure S6A). We
also observed that elevated levels of each eIF4H isoform
in NIH3T3 cells stimulated wound closure compared
to NIH3T3 control cells. Cells expressing the eIF4H
isoforms were indeed able to migrate efficiently and cover
more than 60% of the wounded area in 8 hours whereas
control NIH3T3 cells were much less efficient in this
process with less than 10% of the wounded area covered
8 hours (Figure 3G and Supplementary Figure S6B).
In order to evaluate the invasive properties of these
eIF4H–transfected clones, we studied their capacity to
cross a reconstituted basement-membrane matrix in vitro,
using invasion chambers. NIH3T3 control cells were poorly
invasive, while expression of the eIF4H isoforms was
associated with invasive properties (30-fold increase compared
to control cells) (Figure 3H and Supplementary Figure S6C).
The role of each eIF4H isoform in chemosensitivity
was next evaluated. Clones expressing eIF4H splice
variants or control cells were treated with cisplatin or
etoposide for 8 hours. The overexpression of both eIF4H
isoforms inhibited caspase 3 and 7 activity compared to
control cells (Figure 3I).
Finally, eIF4H-expressing NIH3T3 cells were
subcutaneously grafted into athymic nude mice.
eIF4H expression significantly enhanced the growth of
transplanted subcutaneous tumors, as shown in Figure 3J.
Taken together, these data demonstrate that eIF4H
overexpression protects against drug-induced apoptosis
in vitro, but also promotes cell proliferation, migration,
invasion, and tumor growth. Elevated levels of each
isoform share the same outcome for these phenotypes.

In order to study the individual contributions of
each eIF4H splice variant on malignant transformation,
we generated NIH3T3 cell lines stably-expressing either
the longer 27 kDa isoform (4HL) or the shorter 25 kDa
isoform (4Hs) under the control of the CMV promoter.
After selection and screening for eIF4H expression by
western blotting, four clones exhibiting about a 10-fold
increased level of expression of the 27 kDa isoform
(4HL1-4) or the 25 kDa isoform (4Hs1-4) were selected
(Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure S5A). The elevated

structured 5′UTRs, and binding domains for specific
regulatory proteins. Thus, we investigated the ability
of eIF4H to modulate the cap-dependent translation of
a luciferase reporter mRNA where either the AUG start
codon is preceded by synthetic 5′UTRs with different
lengths (from 57 to 327 nucleotides) (Figure 4A), or
where the mRNA undergoes cap-independent translation
driven by several viral and cellular IRESs, using luciferase
bicistronic constructs (Figure 4D). We analyzed luciferase
expression for each construct after transient transfection
into NIH3T3 cells expressing each eIF4H isoform or in
NIH3T3 control cells, as well as in A549 and HeLa cells
where eIF4H was stably downregulated. Unambiguously,
data show that constructs with longer 5′UTRs had
increased activity in NIH3T3 eIF4H-expressing cells
compared to control cells (Figure 4B). In agreement
with these results, eIF4H depletion in A549 and HeLa
cells led to the translation inhibition of reporters bearing
longer 5′UTRs (over 188 nucleotides) (Figure 4C and
Supplementary Figure S7B).
Interestingly, the overexpression of each eIF4H
isoform stimulated cellular IRES activity by about 2-fold
(constructs 7–11, Figure 4E). EMCV and FMDV viral IRES
activity was increased to a lesser extent (constructs 12 and
13, Figure 4E). As expected, the IRES activity of HCV,
which was demonstrated to be eIF4A-independent [36],
was not affected by increased eIF4H levels. The depletion
of eIF4H in A549 cells also reduced cap-independent
translation driven by FGF-2, VEGF-A, c-Myc, BIP, EMCV
or FMDV IRES by about 40% (Figure 4F). Similar results
were obtained with HeLa cells and eIF4H-knockout MEF
cells (Supplementary Figure S7D and S7E). All these results
demonstrate that eIF4H is able to specifically modulate
the translation of both mRNA with long 5′UTRs and of
IRES elements containing mRNAs. As observed earlier,
the overexpression of both eIF4H isoforms share the same
consequences on translational regulation.

and Bcl-xL, two potent apoptosis inhibitors (Figure 5A).
Interestingly, the two eIF4H isoforms elicited the same
effect on the regulation of expression of these mRNAs.
Conversely, the expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, CIAP1
and Bcl-xl declined in eIF4H-depleted A549 (Figure 5B)
or HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S7A). We next
investigated the effect of eIF4H on the expression of two
human mRNAs containing G-quadruplex structures in
their 5′UTRs which encode potent growth factors, namely
FGF-2 [37] and VEGF-A [38]. Western blot analysis
demonstrated that eIF4H-kd in A549 cells (Figure  5B)
as well as in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S8),
lowered the expression of the 4 endogenous FGF-2
isoforms. Finally, the VEGF protein levels in the culture
medium were also decreased in eIF4H-kd A549 cells
compared to control cells, as shown by ELISA (Figure 5C).
Taken together, these results suggest that eIF4H
may contribute to tumor progression by promoting the
expression of potent growth and survival factors.

eIF4H stimulates the translation of mRNAs
containing complex 5′UTRs
To address whether eIF4H affected global translation
or the translational efficiency of specific mRNAs we
analysed polysome profiles from control versus eIF4H-kd
A549 cells. Slight changes in the polysome profile (less
polysomes and more free 40S and 60S subunits) were
indicative of minor translation inhibition occurring in
response to eIF4H knockdown (Figure 6A).
To examine the effects of changes in eIF4H levels
on the translation of c-Myc, Bcl-xl, FGF-2 and cyclin D1
mRNA in vivo, we determined the distribution of these
mRNAs in sucrose density gradients. In control cells, Bclxl mRNA sedimented predominantly with heavy polysomes
whereas in eIF4H-silenced cells, it shifted to light
polysomes, indicating a decrease in translation initiation of
this mRNA (Figure 6B). Similar results were obtained with
c-Myc, FGF-2 and cyclin D1 mRNAs. eIF4H depletion had
a minimal effect on the polysomal distribution of actin and
GAPDH mRNAs. These findings are in agreement with the
observation that eIF4H depletion in A549 cells decreased
c-Myc, FGF-2, Bcl-xl and cyclin D1 protein levels, while
eIF4H overexpression in NIH3T3 cells resulted in increased
expression of these proteins (Figure 5A and 5B).
In agreement with previous results obtained
with reporter constructs, these data indicate that eIF4H
preferentially stimulates the translation of mRNAs
containing highly-structured 5′UTRs.

eIF4H promotes the expression of potent growth
and survival factors
These results led us to hypothesize that eIF4H could
be involved in the translation of a limited set of cellular
mRNAs with complex 5′UTRs encoding growth factors,
cell cycle regulators, or anti-apoptotic effectors. If this was
the case, aberrant expression of these mRNAs would result
in cell growth defects and deregulation of the apoptotic
machinery. The expression of cellular mRNAs  with
complex 5′UTRs, including cyclin D1, c-Myc, FGF-2,
Bcl-xl and CIAP-1 was examined by western blotting in
NIH3T3 cells overexpressing the eIF4H isoforms or in
eIF4H-kd A549 and HeLa cells. Data clearly showed that
overexpression of eIF4H in NIH3T3 cells significantly
increased the levels of cyclin D1 and c-Myc, two oncogenes
both implicated in the stimulation of cell proliferation
and in apoptosis-regulated process, as well as cIAP1

remains poor even though the development of targeted
therapies have improved lung cancer management. It has
now become clear that genetic and epigenetic alterations
are only the first layer of genetic reprogramming associated
with tumor progression and that post-transcriptional
regulation, including the control of mRNA translation, plays
an important role in malignant transformation [40].
Protein synthesis is a major factor in determining cell
phenotype and is a tightly regulated process that allows for a
more rapid response than transcriptional control. Translation
is primarily regulated at the ribosome recruitment step and
the formation/activity of the eIF4F complex plays a central
role in this mechanism. Tumor cells undoubtedly benefit
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

from a hyperactive eIF4F complex, and this event is indeed
observed in a wide range of cancers [41]. When activated,
the eIF4F complex reprograms the cellular translational
apparatus to amplify oncogenic signals and regulate
neoplastic capabilities. The oncogenic activities of eIF4E
have been demonstrated in multiple settings [42]. Similarly,
eIF4G overexpression can drive the transformation of
mouse cell lines [43], and eIF4A has been demonstrated
to be an oncogene in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
[24, 25]. Despite extensive interest in the eIF4E, eIF4G and
eIF4A components, few studies have addressed the function
of eIF4A cofactors, namely eIF4H and eIF4B, in cancer
progression. Here we show that the two eIF4H isoforms are

overexpressed in lung carcinomas and that the expression of
this factor inversely correlates with the objective response
to treatment.
We have demonstrated that each isoform of eIF4H acts
as oncogene in NIH3T3 cells by increasing proliferation,
migration and foci formation when grown on soft agar, and
promoting chemoresistance. Moreover, eIF4H-expressing
NIH3T3 cells are tumorigenic in nude mice. Our data also
show that eIF4H stimulates the translation of mRNAs with
either complex 5′UTRs or IRESs. A number of mRNAs
enclosing these specific features encode growth factors, cell
cycle or apoptotic machinery components. As a result, we
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

have demonstrated that an alteration in eIF4H protein levels
deeply affects the protein expression of potent cell growth
and survival regulators or proteins involved in malignancy,
such as cyclin D1, c-Myc, FGF-2, VEGF-A, Ciap1 and Bclxl. These results could account for the strong effect of eIF4H
overexpression on the resistance to drug-induced apoptosis
and tumor progression.
These data are in agreement with the biochemical
function of eIF4H that specifically stimulates the eIF4A
helicase activity. It has been postulated that eIF4A helicase
activity significant affects the translation of individual
mRNAs. When eIF4A helicase activity is low, it is thought

that translation of mRNAs harboring short 5′UTRs is affected
to a lesser degree than that of mRNAs possessing more
extensive 5′UTR secondary structures. Indeed, dominant–
negative eIF4A mutant proteins inhibit the translation of
mRNAs possessing 5′UTR secondary structures, while the
translation of mRNAs with short 5′UTRs is unaffected by
inhibition of the RNA helicase [44 , 45].
Recently it was shown that in breast cancer eIF4A
preferentially stimulates translation of oncogenic genes,
including cyclins, protein kinases, and mRNAs with G/Crich 5′UTRs with potential to form G-quadruplexes [46].
Furthermore eIF4H stimulate IRES activity. IRES
elements have also been mostly reported in mRNAs
containing long 5′UTRs with a high GC content and an
extensive predicted secondary structure. Interestingly, data
from Sun and collaborators indicated that eIF4H could be
targeted internally to stem/loop structures, in combination
with eIF4A [12]. This interaction, which induces rapid mRNA
remodeling, could explain the stimulation of IRES activity
by increasing the recruitment of the initiation complex, or
IRES Trans Acting Factors (ITAFs). These data have been
strengthened by other studies using eIF4A inhibitors. These
molecules were shown to induce both cell cycle arrest of adult
T-cell leukemia by decreasing cyclin D1 expression levels,
and apoptosis by decreasing the expression levels of Bcl-xl
and other anti-apoptotic factors [47, 48], but also to inhibit
cancer cell proliferation, and suppress cap- or IRES-driven
translation without affecting HCV IRES-mediated translation
[49]. eIF4H-silencing experiments displayed identical results,
consistent with published evidence demonstrating that eIF4H
stimulates eIF4A activity [6–8, 12, 15].
One must note that eIF4A is a very weak helicase by
itself but its activity is enhanced upon mutually-exclusive
interactions with eIF4B or eIF4H [6–12]. It is wellknown that the mTOR signaling pathway results in the
phosphorylation and activation of eIF4B by the ribosomal
kinase S6K. Thus, nutrient starvation, osmotic stress,
heat shock, ROS and DNA damage, which are known to
decrease S6K activity, will cause the dephosphorylation of
eIF4B and the inhibition of translation of highly-structured
mRNAs [20, 21, 50, 51]. As previously mentioned, eIF4H is
shorter than eIF4B but shares significant sequence homology
in the RRM. However it lacks a large carboxy-terminal
region encompassing the phosphorylation site (Ser422). We
therefore envisage a model in which eIF4H is constitutively
active and/or overexpressed leading to the expression of
a subset of regulatory and stress response genes, while
housekeeping genes remain unaffected. This hypothesis
is supported by the fact that eIF4H knockdown inhibits
the proliferation of A549 or HeLa cells under low serum
culture conditions (Figure 2D and Supplementary Figure
S3C). Moreover, eIF4H has been demonstrated to be under
the transcriptional control of NF-kB [52], thought to be part
of a stress response that is activated by a variety of stimuli
including UV, serum starvation, and ER stress [53–55].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

During tumor development and progression, hypoxia,
acidosis, glucose depletion and a lack of other nutrients are
caused by a combination of defective perfusion, abnormal
tumor vasculature and uncontrolled proliferation of cancer
cells, leading to eIF4B dephosphorylation [56]. Under these
conditions, constitutively-active eIF4H could stimulate the
translation of transcripts with complex 5′UTRs, conferring
a relevant advantage to cancer cells for tumor growth,
progression and resistance to chemotherapy. Nevertheless,
it is clear that eIF4H has differential effects on the synthesis
of proteins involved in the resistance to chemotherapy
and lung tumor progression, and that these effects could
represent a novel approach to lung carcinoma intervention.
eIF4H overexpression and its contribution to tumor
growth are certainly not restricted to lung carcinoma.
Indeed, eIF4H is detected in 93% of cancers (http://www
.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000106682/cancer), suggesting
that eIF4H-mediated reprogramming of gene expression
might be a general mechanism in tumoral development
and a possible new therapeutic target.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human tissue samples
We prospectively recorded 12 patients with clinicopathological data (Table 1), who underwent surgery for
lung carcinoma at Rangueil Hospital (Toulouse, France)
from 2007 to 2008. Tissues samples (tumoral tissues and
corresponding non-tumoral counterpart) were obtained
from pulmonary lobectomy or pneumonectomy specimens
during surgery and were immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80°C. The protocol had local ethical
committee approval. Consents were obtained from patients
before surgery. Tissue microarray consisting of 184 cases
of SCLC was previously described [27]. All cases were
diagnosed at Papworth Hospital (Cambridge, UK) between
1998 and 2005. They were identified from hospital records
and the formalin fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy tissue
samples were retrieved from the pathology department store
along with their associated histology slides [27]. Clinical
data were available for 53 of these patients that received
etoposide and cisplatin doublet chemotherapy.
Protein extraction and western blotting
Frozen tissue samples were pulverized with “MikroDismembrator” (Sartorius, Aubagne, France) and resuspended
in lysis buffer. Cells were scraped off into phosphatebuffered saline and lysed. Western blotting was performed
as previously described [28]. Membranes were probed with
antibodies against eIF4H, eIF4B and eIF4A (Ab, 1:1000, Cell
Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), CIAP-1 (Ab, 1: 2000,

Between every step, a washing solution was used
(EnVision FLEX Wash Buffer, Dako). Sections were then
treated to block endogenous peroxidase activity and nonspecific sites with the kit EnVision FLEX PeroxidaseBlocking Reagent (Dako, Denmark) during 5 min at room
temperature.
The primary monoclonal anti-eIF4H antibody (antirabbit, 1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA)

digestion of pRL27 and double strand oligonucleotide
insertion generated reporter constructs harboring a variable
5′UTR from nucleotides 57 to 327. The 17 nucleotides
region upstream of the luciferase AUG start codon remained
unchanged in all vectors. The resulting plasmids, namely
pRL57, pRL115, pRL188, pRL217, pRL265 and pRL327,
were checked by DNA sequencing. The sequences, folding
and free energy of the thermodynamic prediction of the
variable 5′UTRs are provided in Supplementary Figure S1.
The bicistronic vectors used in this study have been
previously described and validated [31 , 32].

Cell culture
The HeLa (obtained from ATCC n°. CCL2TM),
A549 (ATCC n° CCL-185) and NIH 3T3 (obtained from
European Collection of Cell Cultures N° 93061524) cell
lines were maintained in DMEM 1g/l glucose supplemented
with 10% FCS, 1% glutamine, 0.1% gentamycin and
incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

Establishment of NIH3T3, A549 and HeLa
cellular models

Plasmid transfection

Stable transfected NIH3T3 clones were obtained by
JetPEI (Polyplus) transfection with two eIF4H-expressing
vectors (see below). Cultures were maintained for 2 weeks
in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418, then 36 clones from
each transfection experiment were picked and transferred
onto 24-well plates before cultivation in larger dishes and
eIF4H expression analysis.
Lentiviral constructs targeting eIF4H (TRCN

AGATCTTTTTG - sh4H2) and non-targeting shRNA
vectors (SHC002V, shScr) were purchased from Sigma. After
transduction, A549 and HeLa cells were selected using 1 μg/
ml puromycin.

A549, HeLa or NIH3T3 cells were seeded into
24-well dishes 1 day prior to transfection and allowed to
grow to 50% confluence. According to the manufacturer’s
instructions, 250 ng of each monocistronic or bicistronic
reporter plasmid was transfected into the cells with the
JetPEI reagent (Polyplus Transfection Illkirch, France)
in 150 mM NaCl. Either the pRL-CMV control vector
expressing Renilla luciferase, or the pGL3 firefly
luciferase reporter vector (50 ng) were co-transfected into
cells. This second reporter gene allowed the expression to
be normalized for calculation of transfection efficiency.

Migration assay
Cell migration was measured using the Boyden
chamber assay (8 μm pore size transwells, Corning, Cell
Biolabs, CBA-100-C, San Diego, CA). Cells (2.5x104)
in 0.5% FCS DMEM were seeded in the upper well. The
lower chamber was filled with 10% FCS media. After 6 or
24 h, the non-migratory cells on the upper surface were
removed with a cotton swab, and cells that had migrated
to the lower filter were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal
violet. Migratory cells were counted under the light
microscope. Each assay was performed in duplicate and
three independent experiments were performed.

Plasmid constructions
The sequences encoding the two splice variants of
eIF4H were PCR amplified using the primer pair 4HATG-F
(AAGCTAGCTATCCATGGCGGACTTCGACACCTACG
ACG) and 4HSTOP-R (AAAAGATCTCCCGGGA GCTC
TCATTCTTGCTC CTTTTGAACGAC), with cDNA from
HeLa cells as template. PCR products were digested by
NheI and BglII and inserted into pCEN [29] digested
by SpeI and BamHI in order to create pC4HsEN and
pC4HLEN plasmids encoding respectively the short and
the long eIF4H isoforms upstream of an EMCV-NEO
cassette. Constructs were confirmed by sequencing and
used to stably transfect NIH3T3 cells. Reporter vectors
with long 5′UTRs were derived from a modified pRL-CMV
(Promega) presenting a HA tag at the 5′ end of the luciferase
coding region [30]. To generate PRL27, a deletion was

pores coated with Matrigel Matrix (BD BioCoat Matrigel
Invasion Chamber, BD biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ
USA). 5x104 NIH3T3, A549 or HeLa cells were suspended in
10% FCS DMEM, placed in the upper chamber and cultured
for 24 h at 37°C. The cells that had invaded to the lower

surface of the filter inserts were stained with crystal violet
prior to cell density evaluation. Each assay was performed in
duplicate and three independent experiments were carried out.

To test the effect of different drugs, cells were
plated into 96-well plates and incubated with varying
concentrations of drugs for 8 h. NIH3T3 and A549 stable
clones were treated with a range of 10 to 100 μM for cisplatin
and 5 to 50 μM for etoposide . HeLa cells were incubated
in the presence of 100 μM cisplatin, 20 μM etoposide.
Apoptosis was evaluated by measuring caspase-3/7 activity
using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay (Promega, Lyon, France).
An incubation of 1 h at 37°C was performed after addition
of the Caspase-Glo 3/7 reagent. Luminescence was recorded
using the Centro LB 960 (Berthold Technologies, Bad
Wilbad, Germany) and the background luminescence was
subtracted from experimental values.

Anchorage-independent growth assay
5 × 104 NIH3T3 cells resuspended in DMEM
containing 0.33% Noble agar (Gibco) were seeded onto
6 cm dishes over a 0.5% Noble agar lower coat [33].
Cells were fed every 3 days and colony number was
scored after 25 days by 3-(4.5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) staining.

Proliferation assays
Control NIH3T3 cells and stable clones overexpressing
either the short eIF4H isoform (4Hs1 and 4Hs2) or the long
isoform (4HL1 and 4HL2) were seeded in 96-well plates (800
cells) and cultivated under low serum conditions (1% FCS)
for 10 days. HeLa or A549 cells were seeded in 96-well plates
(1000 cells) and cultivated in low serum medium (0.5% FCS)
for 5 days. Viable cell number was determined on the basis of
mitochondrial conversion of MTT to formazine. Cells were
incubated with MTT for 2 h at 37°C and the crystals were
solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide for 1 hour at RT. Optical
density was read at 560 nm (Asys, Serlabo Technologies,
Entraigues sur la Sorgue, France).

Luciferase activity
The two luciferase activities (LucR and LucF)
were measured in NIH3T3, A549 or HeLa cell extracts
using the Dual Luciferase kit (Promega, Lyon, France) as
previously described [34].

Sucrose-gradient fractionation, polysomeassociated RNAanalysis and RT–PCR
Sucrose density-gradient centrifugation, used to
separate ribosomes into polysomal and subpolysomal
forms, were performed essentially as described previously
[35]. Briefly, extracts from A549 cells were prepared by
lysis at 4°C in extraction buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0,
140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet-P40 and 500
U/ml RNAsin), and nuclei were removed by centrifugation
(12 000g, 10 s, 4°C). The supernatant was supplemented
with 20 mM dithiothreitol, 150 μg/ml cycloheximide, 1 mM
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and centrifuged (12 000g, 5
min, 48°C). The supernatant was layered onto a 12 ml linear
sucrose gradient (15–40% sucrose (w/v) supplemented
with 10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 10 mM dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide)
and centrifuged in a SW41Ti rotor (Beckman, Villepinte,
France) for 2 h at 160 000g, 4°C, without braking. Fractions
of 750 μl were collected using an ISCO collector and UV
optical unit type 11 (Lincoln, NE). The data were acquired
using an analog-to-digital converter USB-1208 device and
Tracer-DAQ software (Measurement Computing Inc.).
Each fraction was digested with 100 μg of proteinase K in
1% SDS and 10 mM EDTA (30 min, 37°C). RNAs were
then recovered by phenol–chloroform–isoamyl alcohol
extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Pellets were
washed with 70% ethanol pre-stored at 20°C, air-dried and
resuspended in appropriate volumes of RNAse-free water.
RNAs were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.2% agarose
gels. Reverse transcription was performed on 1/10 of each
fraction using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Fermentas) with a random hexamer according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. The resulting cDNA

Wound healing assay
Migration (wound healing) was performed using
the CytoSelect™ 24-Well Wound Healing Assay (Cell
Biolabs, San Diego, CA), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, NIH3T3 cells (2.5 × 105) were seeded
in wells with inserts and cultured until a monolayer
was formed (24 h). After insert removal, migration was
monitored for 3, 8 or 20 h. All experiments were repeated
at least three times and data are presented as mean values.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and
fixed in cold 70% ethanol overnight at −20°C. Cells were
then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline −0.1%
bovine serum albumin and once with phosphate-buffered
saline then labeled using propidium iodide staining for 30
min (Invitrogen). Cell cycle distribution was evaluated by
fluorescence analysis on a MACSQuant VYB (Miltenyi
Biotec). Cell doublets were excluded and 10000 events per
condition were analyzed.

Quantification of VEGF by ELISA
The amount of VEGF in the A549 cell culture
medium was measured using ELISA kits specific for
VEGF (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
