Abstract
Although the heartwood of Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen (Leguminosae) is an
important source of traditional Korean and Chinese medicines, the effects of novel
compound methoxydalbergione (4-MD) isolated from Dalbergia odorifera was not
reported. Herein, we investigated the effects of the 4-MD in vitro and in vivo against
osteosarcoma cells and its molecular mechanisms. 4-MD inhibited the proliferation
of osteosarcoma cells and induced apoptosis as evidenced by Annexin V + and TUNEL
+
cells. This apoptosis was accompanied by upregulation of apoptotic proteins
(procaspase-3 and PARP), but downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Survivin). 4-MD inhibited phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 with the inactivation
of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and CREB, and the upregulation of
PTEN in osteosarcoma cells. Importantly, 4-MD reduced colony formation in soft agar
and inhibited tumor growth in mice xenograft model in association with the reduced
expression of PCNA, Ki67, p-STAT3, and Survivin. Taken together, the present study
for the first time demonstrates that 4-MD exerts in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative
effects against osteosarcoma cells through the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway,
and suggest the potential for therapeutic application of 4-MD in the treatment of
osteosarcoma.

Introduction

of new anti-cancer therapies [4-5]. Intracellular activation
of caspases leads to the degradation of cellular proteins
to maintain cell survival and death, and also apoptosis is
regulated by the proapoptotic B-cell lymphoma protein-2
(Bcl2) family of proteins, such as Bax, Bid, and Bak,
and by the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 family of proteins such as
Bcl2 and Bcl-xL, and Survivin [6]. The signal transducers
and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) is a latent
transcription factor that resides in the cytoplasm [7].
STAT3 phosphorylation is mediated through the activation
of non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases family of Januslike kinase (JAK). The JAK2/STAT3 pathway has shown
to have roles in the oncogenesis of several cell types [8-

Osteosarcoma is the most common bone
malignancy, accounting for about 60% of malignant
bone tumors diagnosed in the children and adolescents
with an aggressive local pattern of growth and high
metastatic potential [1-2]. Although the combination of
surgery and chemotherapy has improved osteosarcoma
treatment dramatically, no substantial change in survival
has been seen over the past 20 years [3]. Therefore, novel
therapeutic strategies for osteosarcoma are required.
Apoptosis is a form of cell death coordinated by a
network of genes and is a key target in the development

9]. JAK2/STAT3 signaling has been shown to regulate the
expression of genes that participate in oncogenesis such as
apoptosis inhibitors (Bcl-xl, Bcl-2, and Survivin) and cell
cycle regulators [10]. Thus, it is suggested that targeting
JAK2/STAT3 proteins may represent an important
therapeutic target for novel cancer therapy.
Dalbergia odorifera (D. odorifera) is mainly
distributed in China and, its heartwood is used as a
traditional medicine in China and Korea for treating
blood disorders, ischemia, swelling, necrosis, and
rheumatic pain [11]. Previous studies have reported that
D. odorifera possesses a variety of beneficial properties
including antioxidant, antimicrobial, antiinflammatory,
and antitumor activities in diverse cells types [12-17].
We previously demonstrated that flavonoids extracted
from D. odorifera, exhibited cytoptotective and antiinflammatory properties [17-18]. Recently, we reported
that 2,4,5-trimethoxyldalbergiquinol (TMDQ) isolated
from D. odorifera promotes osteoblastic differentiation
[19].

Although
we
isolated
and
identified
4-methoxydalbergione (4-MD) from the heartwood of D.
odorifera, its pharmacological effects in osteosarcoma
have not been reported yet. This study investigated
whether 4-MD can mediate its anti-proliferative and
apoptotic effects in human osteosarcoma cells through
the suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. In addition,
the effects of the 4-MD in vivo xenograft models of
osteosarcoma were assessed.

Results
4-MD inhibits cell growth in osteosarcoma cells
4-MD was isolated from dried heartwoods of
Dalbergia odorifera (Figure 1A). In order to investigate
the inhibitory effect of 4-MD on cell growth of
osteosarcoma MG63 and U-2 OS cells, the cells were

4-MD induces early and late apoptosis

treated with 1, 10, and 30 µM concentrations of 4-MD
for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, and then analyzed using a MTT
assay. The inhibitory effects of 4-MD were compared
between aggressively growing osteosarcoma (MG63) and
mildly growing osteosarcoma (U-2-OS) cells. As shown
Figure 1B, cell growth inhibitory effects were significantly
exhibited in concentration-dependent manners both in
MG63 and U-2-OS cells. However, 4-MD effectively
inhibited cell growth in MG63 cells compared to U-2OS cells (Figure 1B). Compared to Vincristine (VCT), a
commercial chemotherapeutic agent, the inhibitory effects
of 4-MD quickly appeared at 24 h, as well as 4-MD more
effectively suppressed at 48 h and 72 h than VCT (Figure
1B). Morphologic observation clearly showed that the
MG63 cells were gradually reduced in size and changed
into a small round single cell shape by the treatment of
4-MD in a dose dependent manner compared to U-2-OS
cells (Figure 1C), and thus MG63 cells were chosen in all
subsequent experiments.

To determine whether the 4-MD-induced growth
inhibition of ostesarcoma cells was associated with the
induction of apoptosis, cells were treated with 4-MD and
assessed using two apoptosis assays, Annexin V-FITC and
TUNEL assays. As shown in Figure 2A, the percentage of
apoptotic cells by annexin V-FITC assay was increased in
4-MD-treated osteosarcoma cells as compared to control
in a dose dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 1A).
A characteristic of apoptosis was present in 4-MD treated
cells by fluorescent microscopy after annexin V staining
(Figure 2B). When TUNEL assays were performed to
assess DNA fragmentation as a late event in the process
of apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells after treatment with
4-MD, the dose-dependent TUNEL-positive cells were
increased (Figure 2C, 2D and Supplementary Figure 1B).

4-MD regulates apoptotic regulatory proteins

of cells [20]. As shown in Figure 6, exposure of 4-MD
caused concentration-dependently significant reduction
in anchorage-independent growth and colony formation
compared with vehicle treated controls.

To investigate the underlying mechanisms involved
in 4-MD-induced apoptosis, the change in the expression
levels with various apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins
was analyzed. 4-MD induced the cleavage of procaspase-3
and PARP as seen by the disappearance of the procaspase-2
and PARP band, and appearance of its cleavage products
(Figure 3A). In contrast, 4-MD suppressed the expression
of antiapoptotic proteins such as Bcl-xL and Survivin in a
concentration-dependent manner (Figure 3B).

4-MD inhibits the JAK2/STAT3 pathways via the
inactivation of MAPKs and the upregulation of
PTEN
To evaluate the effects of 4-MD on activation of
STAT3 and its upstream JAK2 pathway in osteosarcoma
cells, Western blot analysis was performed. As
shown in Figure 4A, 4-MD inhibited the constitutive
phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 in a dose-dependent
manner, with maximum inhibition occurring at 30 μM.
Time course studies also indicate that 30 μM 4-MD
dramatically blocked phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3
with maximum inhibition occurring at 4 h (Figure 4B).
Because nuclear translocation is central to the function
of transcription factors and it is not certain whether
phosphorylation is mandatory for nuclear transport of
STAT3 and its oncogenic functions, it was determined
whether 4-MD can suppress nuclear translocation of
STAT3. 4-MD inhibited the translocation of STAT3 to the
nucleus in osteosarcoma cells (Figure 4C)
Next, the effects of 4-MD on the activation
of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and
cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) were
investigated. Western blot analysis showed that treatment
of the cells with 4-MD significantly reduced the activation
of ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK as well as CREB in a
dose dependent manner (Figure 5A, 5B). In order to
determine the downstream consequences of MAPK
and CREB, the ability of 4-MD on expression of PTEN
(phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome
ten) was examined. The results showed a concentrationdependent increase of PTEN in osteosarcoma cells treated
with 4-MD, as compared with that in untreated cells
(Figure 5C).

antibodies against phospho-ERK (p-ERK), ERK, phospho-JNK
(p-JNK), phospho-p38 (p-p38), and p38 (A), or phospho-CREB
(p-CREB) and CREB (B), or PTEN and β-actin (C). These data
were representative of three independent experiments.

anchorage-independent growth by soft agar colony
formation, which is a good model to study tumorigenicity
and is closely associated with the transformed property

Discussion

On the basis of our in vitro studies, we finally
examined the in vivo antitumor activities of 4-MD in a
xenograft mouse models. Representative tumors in the
xenograft mice treated with or without 4-MD are shown
in Figure 7A. Moreover, 4-MD significantly decreased by
22.25 ± 11.46 % of the tumor weight compared to control
(Figure 7B). To determine whether growth inhibition and
apoptosis is responsible for the observed antitumor activity
of 4-MD, immunohistochemistry for proliferation, STAT3
signaling, and antiapoptotic proteins were examined in
xenograft tissue. Results showed that 4-MD effectively
suppressed the expression of proliferation marker (Ki67 and Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), antapoptotic molecule (Survivin), and therapeutic target
molecule (p-STAT3) in tumor tissues (Figure 7C).

Despite recent therapeutic advances, osteosarcoma
remains one of the most lethal and treatment resistant
solid tumors. As a part of our ongoing effort for the
identification of natural products with anti-cancer effects
in vitro and in vivo, we present here first time that 4-MD
inhibits the growth and induces apoptosis of osteosarcoma
cells through the suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway,
and inhibits growth of osteosarcoma cells in a xenograft
mouse model.
To date, no data have been reported regarding the
effects of 4-MD in osteosarcoma cells. To gain insight
into the effects of 4-MD, we evaluated the effects of
4-MD in two commonly used osteosarcoma cell lines,

U-2 OS and MG 63. Our cell proliferation assays and two
apoptosis assays showed that 4-MD strongly inhibited the
proliferation and induced apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells
in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggested that
the death of osteosarcoma cells treated with 4-MD was
a consequence of cell apoptosis caused by 4-MD. These
results was supported by 4-MD treatment upregulation
of apoptotic proteins (procaspase-3 and PARP), but
downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Survivin).
JAK2/ STAT3 signaling regulates several

important pathways in tumorigenesis including cell cycle
progression, apoptosis, tumor invasion, and metastasis
[21-22]. Thus, activated JAK2/STAT3 signaling has
been extensively validated as a new molecular target for
the treatment of human solid tumor [10]. For example,
natural products inhibit JAK2/STAT3 signaling and
induce apoptosis in various cancer cells [10, 23]. In
the present study, 4-MD treatment directly inhibited
the phosphorylation of JAK2 and the downstream
phosphorylation of STAT3. Moreover, 4-MD also downregulated the expression of the STAT3 target proteins, Bcl-

4-Methoxydalbergione (8 mg). The structure of this
compound was elucidated by comparative analysis of the

xL, and Survivin. These results indicate that JAK2/STAT3
signaling is involved in the anti-osteosarcoma effect of
4-MD.
MAPK signaling cascades is also important for
activation of STAT3 [24-25]. CREB is a transcription
factor which is a common critical MAPK downstream
pathways [26]. PTEN is a major negative regulator of the
PI3-K/AKT signal pathway involved in tumorigenesis
[27]. PTEN can also regulate JAK2/STAT3 signaling,
which can alter its ability to regulate the transcription of
genes [27-28]. Our results showed that 4-MD reduced
the phosphorylation levels of ERK, JNK, and p38 as
well as CREB, and induced significant increase in
PTEN expression. These results suggested that 4-MD
can regulate the activity of CREB and MAPK, and
consequently increases the expression of PTEN, which
leads to STAT3 inactivation and osteosarcoma cells
growth.
In the present study, 4-MD reduces anchorageindependent growth of ostesarcoma cells, and inhibits
tumor growth in a xenograft nude mouse model. Ki67 protein is expressed in proliferating cells during all
active phases of the cell cycle and is regarded as the
most promising biomarker for cell proliferation [29].
PCNA is involved in eukaryotic DNA synthesis and
plays an important role in the cell cycle regulation [30].
Expression of PCNA is significantly increased in the
process of malignant transformation of normal epithelium
and is considered as a cell proliferation marker [3031]. Concomitant with the results obtained for in vivo
tumor growth inhibition, we also observed decreased
proliferation as documented by PCNA and Ki-67
immunostaining, and increased apoptosis as documented
by decreased Survivin expression within tumor tissues.
Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis confirmed
the downregulation of p-STAT3 following treatment with
4-MD in vivo, which was consistent with our findings in
vitro. Thus, our results suggest that 4-MD inhibits the
JAK2/STAT3 signaling, which in turn leads to suppression
of tumor growth in vitro and in vivo.
In conclusion, the present study is the first report
that 4-MD shows profound anti-cancer activity in vitro and
in vivo, and also induces cell apoptosis in osteosarcoma
cells by inhibiting the JAKT2/STAT3 pathway. These
findings suggest that 4-MD can be potentially applicable
for therapeutic effects of osteosacoma.

Cell culture
MG63 and U-2 OS cells were grown in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 units/ml),
and streptomycin (100 μg/mL) at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. Direct seeding of
cells (5 × 105 cells/ 6 well plate) was performed For the
experiments. After overnight incubation, culture medium
was replaced with fresh DMEM and cells were treated
with various concentration of 4-MD.

Cell proliferation
Cell proliferation was measured by an
3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay to detect NADH-dependent
dehydrogenase activity as previously described [33].
Fifty microliters of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) in 1X
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was directly added to
the cells, which was then incubated for 2 h to allow MTT
to metabolize to formazan. Absorbance was measured
at a wavelength of 540 nm using an enzyme linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader (Beckman Coulter,
Fullerton, CA).

This work was supported by the National Research
Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea
government (MEST) (No, 2012R1A5A2051384)

Six-week-old male BALB/c athymic nude mice
were purchased from Samtako (Osan, Kyoung Gi-Do,
Korea). Human osteosarcoma MG63 cells (6 mg/ 1 ×
106 cells) were injected subcutaneously (1×107 cells/0.1
mL PBS/animal) into the right-lower flanks of the carrier
mice as previously described [36-37]. After 10 days, four
groups of mice (n = 5) were i.p. injected with 4-MD (0.3,
3, and 9 mg/kg in PBS and 0.01% DMSO) two times a
week for 3 weeks. The control group of mice (n = 5) were
treated with vehicle (PBS and 0.01% DMSO) two times a
week for 3 weeks. At the end of the experiment, cervical
dislocation was performed for euthanasia.

All specimens were fixed in formalin and embedded
in paraffin for examination. Sections (5 μm thickness)
were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and
analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The sections were
deparaffinized by immersing into xylene solution,
rehydrated, subjected to heat-mediated antigen retrieval
treatment, washed with distilled water and proceed
with immunohistochemical procedure. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation with
1% hydrogen peroxide solution in methanol for 30 min
and washed with 1X PBS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) for
5 min. Next, the sections were blocked with 5% BSA
diluted in 1X PBS for 30 min, incubated overnight with
specific antibodies at 4°C, and washed 3 times with 1X
PBS. The immunological detection was started with
incubation in horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated
secondary antibodies (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch)
for 1 h at room temperature. After washing with 1X PBS,
chromogen development was performed with 0.02% 3,
3’-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB, Vector
Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and slides counterstained
with hematoxylin. Finally, sections were dehydrated with
ethanol, cleared with xylene, and mounted with Permount
(Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL), and evaluated on a light
