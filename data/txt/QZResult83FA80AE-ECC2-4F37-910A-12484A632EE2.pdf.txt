Abstract
The EGF receptor (EGFR)-directed monoclonal antibody cetuximab is the only targeted therapy approved for
the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) but is only effective in a minority of
patients. Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been implicated as a drug resistance mechanism in
multiple cancers, and the EGFR and Hedgehog pathways (HhP) are relevant to this process, but the interplay
between the two pathways has not been deﬁned in HNSCC. Here, we show that HNSCC cells that were naturally
sensitive to EGFR inhibition over time developed increased expression of the HhP transcription factor GLI1 as
they became resistant after long-term EGFR inhibitor exposure. This robustly correlated with an increase in
vimentin expression. Conversely, the HhP negatively regulated an EGFR-dependent, EMT-like state in HNSCC
cells, and pharmacologic or genetic inhibition of HhP signaling pushed cells further into an EGFR-dependent
phenotype, increasing expression of ZEB1 and VIM. In vivo treatment with cetuximab resulted in tumor shrinkage
in four of six HNSCC patient-derived xenografts; however, they eventually regrew. Cetuximab in combination with
the HhP inhibitor IPI-926 eliminated tumors in two cases and signiﬁcantly delayed regrowth in the other two
cases. Expression of EMT genes TWIST and ZEB2 was increased in sensitive xenografts, suggesting a possible
resistant mesenchymal population. In summary, we report that EGFR-dependent HNSCC cells can undergo both
EGFR-dependent and -independent EMT and HhP signaling is a regulator in both processes. Cetuximab plus
IPI-926 forces tumor cells into an EGFR-dependent state, delaying or completely blocking tumor recurrence.

Introduction
Squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC) is a
devastating disease afﬂicting more than 45,000 people in the
United States each year (1). The EGF receptor (EGFR)–directed
inhibitor cetuximab is the only approved targeted therapy for
the treatment of HNSCC (2, 3). However, efﬁcacy is low and
patients that initially show a promising response often become
refractory (4, 5). The EGFR and hedgehog pathways (HhP) have
been implicated as key drivers of proliferation and survival of
cancer cells. HhP signaling may also be a crucial pathway in the

survival and characteristics of cancer stem cells and is a likely
candidate for drug resistance (6, 7).
EGFR and HhP signaling converge and/or synergize
upstream of GLI1 through the mitogen-activated protein/
extracellular signal–regulated kinase (MEK)/extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway in cancer cells
and during keratinocyte oncogenic transformation (8–10). EGF
stimulates expression of GLI1 and target genes BCL2 and
PTCH1 in gastric cancer (11), and the HhP ligand sonic
hedgehog (SHH) signals through mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) to
increase expression of HhP-speciﬁc targets in renal cancer (12).
Both pathways have been closely linked to epithelial-to
mesenchymal transition (EMT; refs. 13, 14). In this process,
epithelial cells gain a more spindle- or ﬁbroblast-like phenotype and become more mobile and invasive, Molecularly, EMT
is characterized by expression of the pro-EMT ZEB, SNAIL, and
TWIST transcription factors, loss of E-cadherin and increased
levels of vimentin (Vim; ref. 15). The ability of cells to alter their
morphology is often associated with drug resistance, allowing
tumor cells to escape from cytotoxic and pathway-targeted
therapies (16–18). Recently, reports have described an EGFinduced EMT-like state in EGFR-dependent HNSCC and

prostate cancer cell lines (19, 20). On the other hand, chronic
geﬁtinib treatment was found to generate a mesenchymal
drug-resistant population in HNSCC cells independent of
EGFR activation (21). The dichotomy of these EGFR-dependent and -resistant states and the role of HhP signaling have yet
to be clariﬁed in HNSCC.
The relationship between these pathways and their individual roles in EMT and drug resistance was previously investigated in immortalized keratinocytes or cancer cell lines (8, 11).
We have generated and characterized a direct patient xenograft bank of HNSCC tumors implanted directly into mice with
no time spent in culture. These in vivo tumor models may
better mimic tumor heterogeneity and the relationship with
the microenvironment (22).
We aimed to deﬁne the roles of EGFR and HhP signaling in
early (EGFR-dependent) and late (EGFR-independent) EMT,
migration/invasion, and anti-EGFR therapy susceptibility in
HNSCC. We characterized the cross-talk between EGFR and
HhP in HNSCC, and conducted combination studies targeting
EGFR and HhP signaling in patient-derived xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and in vitro drugs
HN11, Tu-167, FaDu, and 584 HNSCC cell lines were previously described (23–28) and grown in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed
Eagle Medium with 10% FBS, 200 U/mL penicillin, and 200
mg/mL streptomycin. Low serum media (LSM) contained
0.5% FBS. Erlotinib, AZD6244, and ZSTK474 were acquired
commercially. IPI-926 was supplied by Inﬁnity Pharmaceuticals Inc. To generate resistant cell lines, cells were continuously
cultured in erlotinib (1, 5, 10, and 25 mmol/L) or dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO; control). Erlotinib concentration was
increased when cultures proliferated at more than 50% of
controls. Final selection at 50 mmol/L erlotinib was completed
3 for 72 hours allowing regrowth in-between.

Time-lapse imaging and cell tracking
Media on cells seeded on a 24-well plate was changed to LSM
containing vehicle or drug for 24 hours before EGF treatment
(100 ng/mL). Images were taken on a Zeiss Axiovert equipped
with an environmental chamber and a Hamamatsu CCD
camera. Images were taken every 10 to 15 minutes over the
48-hour time course. Acquisition and cell tracking were done
using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Three points were
chosen per well, and 10 cells were tracked per point, for a
total of 30 tracked cells per condition.
GLI1 promoter luciferase assay
A GLI1 promoter luciferase reporter construct was purchased (SwitchGear Genomics) containing approximately
1,000 bp DNA fragment upstream of GLI1 overlapping the
transcribed region by 50 bp. Positive, negative, and GAPDH
promoter controls were used. Cells were seeded (1,500/well in
100 mL medium) in white-walled 96-well plates and transfected
as per the manufacturer's instructions. Wells were treated with
1 mmol/L erlotinib for 24 hours, then plates were frozen at
80 C for more than 12 hours. Plates were thawed and 100 mL
of luciferase substrate was added. Luminescence was measured on a Synergy 2 micro-plate reader (BioTek).

In vitro Matrigel invasion assay and colony formation
Cells were added to 6-well Matrigel-coated 8-mm pore
inserts (BD Biosciences) and incubated for 24 hours. Invasion
was quantiﬁed as cells per view, 6 ﬁelds per insert, repeated
twice. Next, invading and noninvading cells were collected and
seeded (300 cells/well). Cells were allowed to adhere (6–12
hours) before drug and incubated for 24 to 72 hours. Plates
were incubated for 7 days. Resulting colonies (>50 cells) were
ﬁxed with 4% formalin and stained using 0.1% crystal violet.

Human xenograft generation and in vivo studies
Brieﬂy, fresh tumor tissue from patients with HNSCC consented at the University of Colorado Hospital (Aurora, CO) in
accordance with the protocol approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board (COMIRB # 08-0552) were
collected. Prepared 3 mm  3 mm  3 mm tumor pieces were
dipped in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and inserted into a
"pocket" in both hind ﬂanks of nude mice. Upon reaching 1,500
mm3, tumors were passed to a second colony of animals for
therapeutic studies.
We tested cetuximab (acquired commercially), IPI-926, and
the combination in 6 patient cases to generate efﬁcacy data.
For each case, we implanted 40 tumors in 20 mice. When
tumors reached 200 mm3, mice were distributed into 4 groups
(at least n ¼ 8 tumors/group) and treated: control, cetuximab
40 mg/kg 2/week intraperitoneally, IPI-926 40 mg/kg 5/week
per os, or cetuximab 40 mg/kg 2/week plus IPI-926 40 mg/kg 5/
week for 4 weeks. Tumor size was evaluated twice weekly using
the formula: volume ¼ (length  width2)/2. Six hours after the
last drug administration, tumors were extracted and portions
were ﬂash-frozen and embedded in parafﬁn. For shRNA studies, 100,000 cells transfected with scrambled or GLI1 constructs
were injected subcutaneously in the ﬂank of nude mice.

Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay
Cells (2,500–5,000) were plated in 96-well plates and incubated overnight. Drug was added and plates were incubated for

Gene silencing
siRNA experiments were completed in serum-free media
(SFM) using 1 mL/mL Dharmafect1 and 100 nmol/L siRNA
(Thermo). GLI1 silencing was completed using doxycycline (0.5
mg/mL)-inducible pTRIPZ lentiviral contructs (RHS469699636732; Open Biosystems) expressing short hairpin RNA
(shRNA). Infection of cells with scramble or GLI1 sequences

Instruments). For immunohistochemical staining, slides were
deparafﬁnized and rehydrated in graded concentrations of
alcohol by standard techniques before antigen retrieval in
citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Dako Corp.) at 105 C for 20 minutes.
All staining was done in a Dako Autostainer. Slides were
incubated in 3% H2O2 for 10 minutes, followed by primary
pS6K antibody (2211; Cell Signaling) and incubated for 60
minutes at room temperature. Staining was developed by:
EnVisionþ Dual Link System HRP (Dako) for 30 minutes and
substrate-chromogen (DABþ) Solution (Dako) for 7 minutes.
Slides were then counterstained with Automated Hematoxylin

in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes, before blocking in 1%
bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature with shaking. Cells were incubated with E-cadherin
(Cell Signaling, 4295) and/or vimentin (Cell Signaling, 9854)
for 1.5 hours at room temperature at 1:50 and 1:200 dilutions,
respectively. Alternatively, cells were incubated with isotype
controls, including rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488
(Cell Signaling, 2975) and rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa
Fluor 555 (Cell Signaling, 3969). Cells were rinsed in PBST
3 for 5 minutes, once with PBS and mounted with Prolong
anti-fade with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Invitrogen). Images were taken on an Olympus IX81 microscope
equipped with a Hamamatsu CCD camera. Each experiment
(200 cells analyzed) was repeated twice.

RNA isolation and gene expression analysis
Samples (30 mg) were placed in 300 mL of QIAzol, and
homogenized using the MP Biomedicals Fast Prep 24. RNA was
extracted using Qiagen kits according to the manufacturer's
instructions. RNA concentration and quality was measured
using the NanoDrop. RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA in
20 mL reactions using the Verso cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fisher
Scientiﬁc). Reverse transcription reactions followed the protocol recommendations and were conducted using the Verti 96Well Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan primer
probes (Applied Biosystems), PCR ampliﬁcation, and probe
detection were accomplished using the StepOnePlus Real-Time
PCR System (Applied Biosystems). All data are representative
of experiments carried out at least 2 times in triplicate.

Analysis of vimentin-positive cells by ﬂow cytometry
Cells (1  106) were ﬁxed in 2 mL 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS at 4 C for 15 minutes and then 100% cold ethanol was
added drop-wise to a ﬁnal concentration of 80%. Cells were
resuspended in permeabilization buffer (0.25% Triton X-100 in
PBS) for 30 minutes and washed 2 with cold PBS. Cells were
suspended in anti-Vim-FITC antibody (Cell Signaling, 9454) at
1:50 in PBS þ 2% FBS, incubated for 1 hour, and analyzed on a
Cyan ﬂow cytometer (Beckman Coulter).

Western blotting
Cell pellets were lysed in 30 to 100 mL radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing 5 mL/mL
phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride (PMSF). Tissue sample (50
mg) portions were thawed in a 4 volume of RIPA buffer
and homogenized using single-use plastic pestles. Protein was
measured using the ELx800 absorbance microplate reader
(BioTek) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Thirty
nanogram of protein was loaded per well into NuPage Novex
4% to 12% Bis–Tris Midi Gel (Invitrogen), transferred using the
iBlot Gel Transfer Stack System (Invitrogen) then processed.
Primary antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technologies: 2236 phospho-EGFR (Tyr1068; 1H12) mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb), 4405 EGFR (15F8) rabbit mAb, 4060
phospho-Akt (Ser473; D9E) XP(R) rabbit mAb, 4821 Akt (pan;

EGFR inhibition upregulates the HhP
Acquired resistance to EGFR inhibition is common. Previous
reports synergistically linked EGFR and HhP through MEK/
ERK (9), and we hypothesized that this relationship may
provide a mechanism for EGFR resistance in HNSCC. Sensitivity to anti-EGFR therapy was previously correlated with
c-FOS suppression in HNSCC cell lines (24). Following 1 mmol/L
erlotinib treatment, c-FOS levels decreased by 6 hours and
remained suppressed at 24 hours for the epithelial HN11 and
Tu-167 cell lines, whereas levels remained unchanged in the
mesenchymal 584 cells. GLI1 mRNA increased in HN11 and Tu167 cells at both time points but remained unchanged in 584
cells (Fig. 1A). The induction of GLI1 corresponded with
reduced levels c-FOS in HN11 and Tu-167, suggesting that
GLI1 expression is only induced after treatment in EGFRdependent cell lines.
Given that EGFR inhibition increased GLI1 mRNA in sensitive
cells led us to identify the effects of EGFR activation. Serumstarved cells were treated with 100 ng/mL EGF, leading to
increased levels of c-FOS within 1 hours. Twenty-four hours
after EGFR activation, expression of GLI1 was signiﬁcantly
reduced in HN11 and Tu-167 cells but not in 584 (Fig. 1B).
Suppression of GLI1 by EGFR activation was conﬁrmed in HN11
and Tu-167 cells using the EGFR ligands TGF-a and amphiregulin (AR) (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Using a GLI1 promoterbased luciferase assay, we conﬁrmed that the GLI1 promoter
was activated by erlotinib, whereas suppressed by EGF in both

HN11 and Tu-167 cells, but not 584 cells, at 6 and 24 hours. Expression of GLI1 is signiﬁcantly increased in both HN11 and Tu-167 cells but is unchanged in
584 cells. B, EGFR activation by EGF (100 ng/mL) induces c-FOS expression in all cell lines within 1 hour and signiﬁcantly suppresses GLI1 levels in
HN11 and Tu-167 cells at both 1 and 6 hours. However, GLI1 levels are increased in 584 cells at 6 hours after EGF treatment. C, 96-hour treatment with EGF
and erlotinib suppresses and increases GLI1 levels, respectively, in both HN11 and Tu-167 cells. D and E, suppression of GLI1 by EGFR activation
occurs through the MEK/ERK pathway as the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 blocks suppression of Gli1 by EGF, whereas the PI3K inhibitor ZSTK474 does not.

HN11 and Tu-167 cells with no change in 584 cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast to previous reports (8), we found
that neither erlotinib nor EGF treatment modulated GLI1
expression in human keratinocytes (Supplementary Fig. S1C
and S1D). In HN11 and TU-167 cells, 72-hour EGF treatment
suppressed GLI1 protein levels, whereas erlotinib increased
GLI1 levels (Fig. 1C), with crosstalk occurring through MEK/
ERK not PI3K/AKT signaling (Fig. 1D and 1E). Combined, these
results suggest that EGFR signaling downregulates the HhP
transcription factor GLI1 in EGFR-dependent HNSCC cells.
EMT and anti-EGFR therapy resistance in HNSCC
EMT and drug resistance are often related (18, 21), as
observed in our HNSCC cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S2). We
attempted to establish this connection by generating cell lines

HN11 and Tu-167 cells continuously treated with 10 mmol/L
erlotinib highly expressed the HhP transcription factor GLI1
and, to a lesser extent, GLI2 (Fig. 2A). Erlotinib-resistant
(50 mmol/L) HN11 and Tu-167 cells released from erlotinib
treatment had higher c-FOS, ZEB1, SNAIL, TWIST, and VIM
expression when compared with parental cells (Fig. 2B), consistent with a mesenchymal phenotype. By ﬂow cytometry,
erlotinib-resistant cells also had signiﬁcant increases in
Vim-positive cell populations (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, cellular
morphology did not differ dramatically from controls. GLI1
and GLI2 were upregulated in cells chronically treated with
erlotinib; therefore, erlotinib-resistant cells were tested for
sensitivity to HhP inhibition with the novel Smoothened
(SMO) inhibitor IPI-926 (29). Erlotinib-resistant cells showed

decreased sensitivity to erlotinib compared with wild-type;
susceptibility to HhP inhibition was similar between
the erlotinib-resistant and wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig.
S2E and Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest that
chronic EGFR inhibition generates cells with EMT-like
characteristics.
EGFR activation induces EMT and motility in HNSCC
cells
Increased GLI1 expression after EGFR inhibition, as well as
the generation of erlotinib-resistant cell lines, provided a
rationale for studying of the relationship between the EGFR
pathway, HhP, and EMT. HNSCC cell lines were treated with
erlotinib and IPI-926 alone or in combination, with or without
EGFR activation by addition of EGF ligand. As previously
reported (19, 20), EGF (100 ng/mL) induced an EMT-like state,
deﬁned by spindle-like cellular morphology, in all 3 epithelial
cell lines (Fig. 3A) but not in EGFR-independent 584 cells. It is
important to note that 500 ng/mL SHH had no noticeable effect
on the morphology of any cell line (not shown). As expected,
erlotinib completely blocked the phenotypic transition but IPI926 had no effect. EGF induces an EMT-like phenotype, with
increased motility that was suppressed by erlotinib on time-

in 584 cells (not shown). Interestingly, IPI-926 increased
cellular velocity in both HN11 (P < 0.01) and Tu-167 cells after
EGF treatment but this effect was not observed in combination with erlotinib (Fig. 3C). These results suggest that EGFR
activation generates an EMT-like state that is not prevented
by HhP inhibition, but that coinhibition of the EGFR and HhP
suppresses EMT.
EGFR signaling increases EMT expression
Next, EMT-related gene expression was measured after EGF
treatment with or without erlotinib, IPI-926, or in combination.
Expression of the pro-EMT transcription factor ZEB1 was
signiﬁcantly increased by EGF treatment in HN11, Tu-167,
and FaDu cells but not 584 cells (Fig. 3D and Supplementary
Fig. S4C). In comparison, EGF did not substantially modulate
the expression of ZEB2, SNAIL, and TWIST1 (not shown). VIM
expression followed that of ZEB1, whereas E-cadherin was
suppressed by EGFR activation. These effects were reversed
by pretreatment with erlotinib, whereas pretreatment with IPI926 before addition of EGF increased expression of both ZEB1
and VIM when compared with EGF alone. These data suggest
that the HhP inhibition might contribute to EGFR-driven EMT.

Figure 3. Inhibition of the HhP may augment EGFR-driven EMT-like state in EGFR-dependent cell lines. A, EGFR signaling activation by the EGF ligand
(100 ng/mL) generates an EMT-like phenotype in HN11 and Tu-167 cells that is completely blocked by erlotinib (1 mmol/L) but not IPI-926 (1 mmol/L).
B and C, EGF increases cellular motility in EGFR-dependent cells, which was blocked by erlotinib but augmented by IPI-926. D, EGF increased expression of
pro-EMT genes ZEB1 and VIM as well as suppressed E-cadherin generating an EMT-like gene expression proﬁle in HN11 and Tu-167 cells but not 584 cells.
However, E-cadherin expression was suppressed by erlotinib treatment in 584 cells.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01.

We used siRNAs to determine if ZEB1 is responsible for
increased expression of VIM by EGFR activation. Both siRNAs
suppressed expression of ZEB1 after EGF treatment that
in turn led to signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) lowered levels of VIM
mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). However, silencing
of ZEB1 did not dramatically change the generation of spindlelike cells by EGF but both siRNAs signiﬁcantly reduced
EGF induced invasion (not shown), indicating that ZEB1 may
be a key transcriptional driver of the EGF-induced EMT-like
state.
Flow cytometry and immunocytochemistry (ICC) conﬁrmed
modulation of Vim by EGF at the protein level. In normal
culture, approximately 1% to 3% of HN11 and Tu-167 cells were
Vim-positive (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4), whereas 100%
of 584 cells were Vim-positive. EGF treatment increased the
percentage of Vim-positive cells 7- and 10-fold in Tu-167 and
HN11 cells, respectively. Erlotinib completely blocked the EGFdriven increase in Vim-positive cells, whereas HhP inhibition
slightly increased the positive population in Tu-167 cells and
signiﬁcantly increased the Vim-positive population (P < 0.05)

3386

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

in HN11 cells. This further suggests that HhP signaling may
promote EGF-induced EMT (Fig. 4A). ICC results show that
Vim-positive and spindle-like cell populations overlap and HhP
inhibition again increases the Vim-positive population after
EGFR activation. Finally, 584 cells are 100% Vim-positive and
express low levels of E-cadherin (Fig. 4B and Supplementary
Table S1). Similarly, silencing of GLI1 (Supplementary Fig. S5D)
slightly increased the Vim-positive population in Tu-167 cells,
whereas remaining unchanged in HN11 cells (Supplementary
Fig. S6A).
We next inquired if EGF could induce an EMT-like state in
erlotinib-resistant cells. Unlike in parental cells, 1 mmol/L
erlotinib did not increase GLI1 in resistant cells but instead
seemed to suppress expression in HN11 and Tu-167 cells.
However, EGF continued to suppress GLI1 expression slightly
in Tu-167 cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A). Induction of ZEB1
and VIM by EGF was nearly completely suppressed in both
HN11 and Tu-167 erlotinib-resistant cells. However, ZEB1 and
VIM continued to be downregulated by erlotinib, whereas EGF
continued to suppress E-cadherin.

Increased invasion associated with EGFR-driven EMT
The EGFR induced EMT-like state increased invasion in
EGFR-dependent cells. Increased invasion was blocked by
erlotinib treatment (Fig. 5A). Consistent with our previous
ﬁndings, IPI-926 augmented EGFR-driven invasion slightly in
Tu-167 cells and signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) in the HN11 cell line
(Fig. 5B). To conﬁrm this was not an unintended effect of IPI926, independent of HhP inhibition, we tested the invasiveness
of HN11 and Tu-167 cells expressing shRNA against GLI1.
Similar to IPI-926, silencing of GLI1 signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05)
increased the invasiveness of cells treated with saturating
levels of EGF in both HN11 and Tu-167 cells (Fig. 5C and
5D). We next questioned whether invasiveness was indicative
of highly proliferative state sensitizing cells to erlotinib. Noninvasive cells more readily formed colonies compared with
invasive cells in HN11 and Tu-167, whereas the opposite was
true for 584 (Fig. 5E). Finally, invasive EGFR-dependent cells
did not show increased sensitivity to erlotinib but noninvasive
HN11 cells had increased sensitivity when compared with their
invasive counterparts (Fig. 5F). Combined, these ﬁndings
indicate that though the EGFR-driven EMT-like state increases
motility and invasiveness, proliferation is suppressed and cells
are not sensitized to EGFR inhibition.

www.aacrjournals.org

MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling are required for
EGF-induced invasion
We next attempted to clarify what pathways downstream
of EGFR regulate this EMT-like event. Before dosing with
EGF HN11 and Tu-167, cells were treated with 1 mmol/L of
the MEK/ERK inhibitor AZD6244 or 1 mmol/L of the PI3K/AKT
inhibitor ZSTK474. Similar to erlotinib, AZD6244 completely
blocked phenotypic change and alone induced tightly associated cells and suppressed expression of ZEB1 and VIM.
ZSTK474 did not affect the EMT induction and signiﬁcantly
increased (P < 0.05) expression of ZEB1 and VIM while further
suppressing E-cadherin by EGF. However, unlike control cells
that form spindle-like cells and dissociate, cells treated with
ZSTK474 formed a distinct phenotype, elongated yet still
tightly associated with adjacent cells (Supplementary Fig.
S7A and S7B). Previous reports support that MEK/ERK is
primarily responsible for generating the mesenchymal phenotype but PI3K/AKT may be crucial to cell-to-cell adhesion
and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP;
refs. 19, 30). Inhibition of MEK/ERK or PI3K/AKT signaling
effectively blocked EGF-induced invasion (Supplementary
Fig. S7C and S7D). Taken together, these results suggest that
EGFR activation in EGFR-dependent cells generates a highly

motile and invasive EMT-like state that is augmented by
inhibition of the HhP via MEK/ERK signaling.
Inhibition of EGFR and HhP signaling in HNSCC cell lines
The above ﬁndings lead us to hypothesize that by inhibiting the HhP we could achieve 2 objectives: (i) increase
EGFR dependence and enhance anti-EGFR therapy efﬁcacy,
and (ii) prevent the EGFR inhibitor-driven EMT switch.
These results also suggested that only dual targeting would
achieve this goal. To this end, we conducted combination
treatment experiments in vitro with erlotinib and IPI-926.
IPI-926 has minimal activity in vitro at concentrations of
1 mmol/L or less and there was little additive effect with
erlotinib. However, 250 mg/mL SHH ligand signiﬁcantly
reduced the antiproliferative effects of erlotinib (Supplementary Fig. S8), suggesting again that activation of HhP
signaling may be a mechanism of resistance for anti-EGFR
therapy.

Cancer Res; 73(11) June 1, 2013

Using in vitro systems, we had observed that suppression
of the HhP increased EGFR-driven motility and invasion.
To explore this in a more complex system, tumorigenicity
of HNSCC cell lines expressing shGLI1 in immune-compromised mice was measured. Tumor formation was inhibited
in both 584-shGli1 (P ¼ 0.16) and HN11-shGli1 (P < 0.01;
Fig. 6A). Resulting tumors were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry
for CD44 and turboRFP, expressed as part of the shRNA
insert. Although CD44 expression was not altered dramatically, turboRFP expression was all but lost in shGLI1
tumors, suggesting that silencing of GLI1 inhibited tumor
formation and the small resulting tumors may have arisen
from cells that had lost the viral insert (Fig. 6B). Resulting
tumor tissue was stained for E-cadherin and K14 and
tumors expressing scramble sequence consisted primarily of cancer cells with interspersed stromal cells. However, cancer cells in shGli1 tumors were found in smaller
pockets within larger areas of mouse stromal cells possibly

Combination cetuximab and IPI-926 treatment in
HNSCC patient xenografts
To better mimic the true tumor environment, we next
tested the efﬁcacy of cetuximab, IPI-926, and the combination using patient-derived HNSCC xenografts. Four of 6
cases had tumor shrinkage after EGFR inhibition by cetuximab (Fig. 7A and B) but none regressed completely and 75%
regrew to baseline during the study. IPI-926 showed modest
single-agent efﬁcacy with only moderate growth retardation
in one xenograft (CUHN004). IPI-926 did not increase the
rate of tumor regression in combination with cetuximab or
dramatically decrease the T/C value at the end of treatment
(Fig. 7B). However, after being released from therapy the
regrowth kinetics for the cetuximab and combination arms
of the study diverged dramatically for all 4 cetuximab
sensitive cases. All tumors regressed completely and never
regrew in the combination arm of 2 cases (CUHN002 and
CUHN027), whereas regrowth was delayed by approximately
1 month in the other 2 cases (Supplementary Table S2),
suggesting IPI-926 increases tumor control in combination
with EGFR inhibition.
To unravel the molecular events underlying this dramatic
efﬁcacy, gene and protein expression were quantiﬁed for genes
relevant to the EGFR pathway, HhP, and EMT. As expected,
expression of c-FOS decreased signiﬁcantly in sensitive xeno-

grafts (CUHN002, CUHN004, CUHN013, and CUHN027) after
cetuximab treatment, whereas remaining unchanged in resistant xenografts (CUHN014 and CUHN022; Supplementary
Fig. S9A and S9B). IPI-926, cetuximab or combination treatment decreased expression of mouse GLI1 in both sensitive
and resistant xenografts, whereas human GLI1 was relatively
unchanged in sensitive xenografts. GLI1 increased in the
combination arm of resistant cases, again conﬁrming that the
mouse stroma compartment may be target of HhP inhibition.
Also, pro-EMT factors ZEB2 and TWIST1 and SNAIL were
found to be upregulated after cetuximab and combination
treatment in sensitive cases while remaining unchanged in the
resistant group. Increased expression of pro-EMT transcription factors was observed for the cetuximab-sensitive xenografts and resembled the expression proﬁle of erlotinib-resistant HNSCC cell lines. These ﬁndings suggest that after a 1
week pharmacodynamic (PD) study tumor cells may have
undergone an EMT or selected for cells in an EMT state; these
are likely the cells responsible for the repopulation of the
tumor, and thus need to be speciﬁcally targeted to achieve a
durable antitumor effect.
Protein analysis revealed that cetuximab reduced pEGFR in
all cases except CUHN027, with a further reduction of total and
pEGFR in combination therapy. Total EGFR was also reduced
in CUHN004 and interestingly in the resistant CUHN014 and
CUHN022 cases, suggesting that intrinsic dependence rather
than the pharmacodynamic effect (that is necessary but not
sufﬁcient) determines susceptibility to EGFR inhibitors.

Downstream assessment was more informative; pMAPK and
pAKT were suppressed in all sensitive cases treated with
cetuximab or in combination. IPI-926 increased pMAPK in all
sensitive cases, pAKT in both CUHN004 and CUHN027 xenografts and pEGFR in CUHN004 (Supplementary Fig. S9C). Also,
IPI-926 treatment increased pS6K in both CUHN004 and
CUHN013 xenografts. Similarly, pS6K were suppressed in both
cetuximab and combination treatment arms in sensitive xenografts while remaining unchanged in resistant cases by immunohistochemistry (Supplementary Fig. S9D). Finally, IPI-926
decreased E-cadherin in cetuximab-sensitive cases following
our ﬁndings in vitro suggesting that HhP inhibition allows cells
to enter an EGFR-dependent EMT-like state (Fig. 7C).
These results suggest that cetuximab signiﬁcantly suppresses MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT signaling in turn reducing
expression of the downstream factor c-FOS in sensitive xenografts. Also, the HhP and EGFR signaling pathways may
negatively regulate each other indicated by increased levels
of pEGFR, pMAPK, pAKT, and pS6K after IPI-926 treatment,
pushing tumor cells into a pro-EGFR state. Again, this conﬁrms
that while HhP inhibition is ineffective as a single agent, it can
push tumor cells further into an EGFR-dependent state, leading to increased killing by anti-EGFR therapy resulting in
tumor obliteration.

Discussion
Preventing intrinsic and acquired resistance to EGFR inhibition with cetuximab would be of beneﬁt to patients suffering
from HNSCC (2, 3), so we attempted to deﬁne the basis of EGFR
resistance. Contrary to previous studies using keratinocytes
(8), we identiﬁed increased expression of the HhP transcription
factor GLI1 after EGFR inhibition as a unique characteristic of
EGFR-dependent HNSCC cells. GLI1 has been shown to be a
key driver of tumor growth and metastasis in multiple cancers
(31, 32). As previously described (9), we found that "cross-talk"
between the EGFR and HhP occurs through the MEK/ERK
cascade, but that HhP inhibition may make cells more EGFR
dependent.
Chronic erlotinib treatment in HN11 and Tu-167 cells dramatically increased GLI1 expression compared with parental
controls and may signify the upregulation of a resistance
pathway. Erlotinib-resistant cells were next generated to determine whether the HhP was a key driver of survival and
proliferation when EGFR signaling is suppressed. Both strains
had characteristics indicating that they had undergone an
EMT event including erlotinib resistance, increased expression
of pro-EMT factors ZEB1, ZEB2, TWIST, and SNAIL, and in Vimpositive cell populations. Similarly generated geﬁtinib-resistant HNSCC cells lines had also undergone an EMT event (21).

Hedgehog Inhibition Blocks Acquired Cetuximab Resistance

However, resistant cells no longer overexpressed GLI1, indicating upregulation only occurred during the transition to the
mesenchymal state, as has previously been reported (13, 33).
These results conﬁrm that EMT is at least an attribute, if not a
direct mechanism, of drug resistance. Combined, these results
generated a strong rationale for combination therapy inhibiting the EGFR and HhP in xenograft models.
Next, we deﬁned how activation and inhibition of the EGFR
and HhP, alone, and in combination, regulate signaling and may
increase sensitivity to EGFR inhibition in HNSCC cell lines. From
these studies, and as observed earlier, we established that there
are 2 distinct mechanisms of EMT in HNSCC cells. As previously
described in epithelial cancer cell lines (19, 20), activation of the
EGFR pathway generates an EMT-like state in EGFR-dependent
HNSCC cells. This "early" EMT-like event is deﬁned by increased
motility and mesenchymal morphology with increased expression of EMT signature genes and a Vim-positive population
leading to invasiveness. Interestingly, this phenotype does not
increase sensitivity or resistance to EGFR or HhP inhibition.
Alhough this EMT-like state does not lead to drug resistance, it
does grant cancer cells invasive potential, and is a potentially
valuable in vitro model of tumor cell migration and invasion.
Also, inhibition of the HhP, both pharmacologically and genetically, augmented the EGFR-driven phenotype by increasing
activation of both MEK/ERK and PI3K/AKT. On the contrary,
HhP activation by SHH increased resistance to erlotinib, conﬁrming that the HhP negatively regulates EGFR signaling,
whereas inhibiting HhP signaling allows cells to enter a state
of greater EGFR dependence. Again, these ﬁndings support the
rationale for combined inhibition of EGFR and HhP signaling as
a means of enhancing anti-EGFR efﬁcacy. We characterized 2
distinct EMT-like events in HNSCC cells, both EGFR-dependent
and -independent and that both states are mutually exclusive as
seen in 584 and erlotinib-resistant cells. Finally, HhP signaling
may help initiate EGFR-independent EMT, whereas suppressing
the EGFR driven EMT-like state.
The use of combination therapy in vitro was relatively
uninformative, and our experiments highlighted the risks of
artiﬁcial, growth factor saturated models. To clarify whether
HhP signaling was a genuine target in HNSCC, in vivo GLI1 was
silenced by shRNA in 2 cell lines and found GLI1 suppression
inhibited tumor formation. Subsequently, and in an optimal
use of an advanced patient-derived animal model, direct
HNSCC patient xenografts were treated with cetuximab and
IPI-926 alone and in combination. Cetuximab treatment
induced tumor shrinkage in 4 of 6 cases but IPI-926 showed
little response in this in vivo model. However, cetuximabtreated xenografts regrew to baseline after the end of
treatment, whereas combination therapy with IPI-926 delayed
regrowth by a month in 2 cases and all tumors were ablated in
the other 2 xenografts. As expected, cetuximab blocked sig-

naling through MEK/ERK and/or PI3K/AKT and combination
treatment enhanced this effect, whereas IPI-926 increased
pMAPK, pAKT, and pS6K in EGFR-dependent cases. It is
important to note that IPI-926 also targets the stromal compartment as mouse GLI1 was suppressed after treatment and
was previously observed in multiple carcinoma models (34, 35).
However, our results do not rule out inhibition of the HhP in
tumor cells, given that GLI1 shRNA abrogated tumor growth in
vivo, an effect that cannot be explained by stromal effects.
These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that inhibition of HhP
signaling pushes HNSCC cells into an even more EGFR-dependent state, sensitizing them to anti-EGFR therapy while blocking a relevant resistance mechanism. As for the efﬁcacy of the
novel therapeutic IPI-296, these ﬁndings support the use of a
more complex animal model that better mimics the human
environment. These provoking results provided the rationale
for the clinical translation of this novel combinatory paradigm
(NCT01255800).
