ABSTRACT
The presence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is linked to preexisting or acquired
drug resistance and tumor relapse. Therefore, targeting both differentiated tumor
cells and CSCs was suggested as an effective approach for non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) treatment. After screening of chemotherapeutic agents, tyrosine kinase
inhibitors (TKIs) or monoclonal antibody in combination with the putative stem
cell killer Salinomycin (SAL), we found Metformin (METF), which modestly exerted
a growth inhibitory effect on monolayer cells and alveospheres/CSCs of 5 NSCLC
cell lines regardless of their EGFR, KRAS, EML4/ALK and LKB1 status, interacted
synergistically with SAL to effectively promote cell death. Inhibition of EGFR (AKT,
ERK1/2) and mTOR (p70 s6k) signaling with the combination of METF and SAL can be
augmented beyond that achieved using each agent individually. Phospho-kinase assay
further suggested the multiple roles of this combination in reducing oncogenic effects
of modules, such as ß-catenin, Src family kinases (Src, Lyn, Yes), Chk-2 and FAK.
Remarkably, significant reduction of sphere formation was seen under combinatorial
treatment in all investigated NSCLC cell lines. In conclusion, METF in combination
with SAL could be a promising treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC
irrespective of their EGFR, KRAS, EML4/ALK and LKB1 status.

INTRODUCTION

activity of TKIs, or might be presented as the secondary
mutation bypassing the continued requirement for the
original target. In general, most instances are associated
with acquired resistance [3]. Additionally, the mutation
frequencies of KRAS, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
and liver kinase B1 (LKB1) are approximately 25%, 3-7%
and 15-30% of NSCLCs, respectively [4, 5]. Mutations
in EGFR, KRAS and ALK are mutually exclusive in
individual tumors; however, KRAS oncogene activation is
coincident with LKB1 deficiency in 7-10% of all NSCLC
[6].
For NSCLC treatment, chemotherapy, moleculartargeted therapy and humanized anti-EGFR blocking
monoclonal antibody (mAb) are widely used. Over a
decade ago, Metformin (METF), originally developed
for type 2 diabetes medication, was shown to decrease
cancer incidence and mortality in diabetic patients [7-9].
The ability of METF to lower the circulating insulin level

Lung cancer is the leading cause of tumor-related
death and accounts for the most common malignancy in
the world. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
highly expressed on the cell surface of > 60% of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [1]. The ``classic``
EGFR mutations, involving in-frame deletions in exon
19 and the L858R point substitution in exon 21, are
representing about 85-90% of all EGFR mutations and
associated with dramatic and lasting response to the EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) Gefitinib and Erlotinib
[2]. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance limits the
therapeutic success of these targeted agents. The other
EGFR mutations, occur relatively rarely with < 10% of
cases, of which the T790M substitution can either be
linked to primary resistance to abrogate the inhibitory

and to stimulate AMPK-mediated suppression of mTOR
and protein synthesis may be integral to its anticancer
properties [8]. Treated with conventional therapies,
tumors may shrink by targeting more differentiated and
proliferating cells, whereas typically after 6-10 months,
most if not all tumors grow back and become more
resistant to the treatment [10]. The cancer stem cell (CSC)
model states that a distinct subpopulation of tumor cells
with stem cell-like properties is responsible for resistance,
metastasis and relapse, leading to the assumption that
tumor heterogeneity and hierarchy are generated by
aberrant downstream differentiation of one single CSC.
Recently, the antibiotic Salinomycin (SAL), acting as a
highly selective potassium ionophore and effectively
targeting CSCs in several types of cancer, such as breast
[11], leukemia [12] and colorectal [13], offers great
promise for a more effective systemic therapy. Based on
this theory, combinatorial treatment with conventional
and CSC specific therapies could provide an effective
approach for complete tumor control.
In the present study we showed that METF, an
antidiabetic medication with anticancer efficacy, modestly
inhibited the growth of NSCLC monolayer cells and
their alveospheres/CSCs in a dose-dependent manner,
interacting synergistically with SAL. Data indicated the
cell growth inhibitory effect of this combination is AMPK
independent. Co-administration of METF and SAL further
suppressed the EGFR signaling pathway accompanied
by inhibition of AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.
Remarkably, significant reduction of sphere formation
(SF) was seen under combinatorial treatment in all 5
investigated NSCLC cell lines irrespective of their EGFR,
KRAS, EML4/ALK and LKB1 status.

Gefitinib. Furthermore, all cell lines carry wt KRAS,
BRAF and PTEN genotypes; in addition, HCC4006 and
NCI-H1975 cells exhibit motility and invasivity (data not
shown).
Two methodologies were later applied to
characterize the CSCs, one of which is SF that is increased
with CSC population and function. From the morphology,
as shown in Figure 1A, we found HCC4006 cells
assembled into highly compact three-dimensional (3D)
alveospheres with a spherical cavity inside, whereas the
3D structure of NCI-H1975 cells was less cohesive. In the
HCC95 cell line, the initial loose aggregates seen at day 1
gradually and randomly increased into relatively compact
spheres after one week in culture. These morphological
characteristics of 3D outgrowth of these cell lines could
indicate the existence of a functional heterogeneity of
CSCs, which may vary from tumor to tumor, depending on
their mutations and distinct genetic profiles. Another used
strategy is the investigation of stem cell marker (SCM)
expression. Until now, to our knowledge, there is no
apparent consensus about the ´´best marker´´ by which to
identify CSCs, hence, here we chose the widely accepted
SCMs for characterization. Real-time PCR demonstrated

RESULTS
Characteristics of the NSCLC cell lines used in
this study
After chemical genomics based cell line selection,
5 NSCLC cell lines were chosen for evaluation (Table1).
Three of them were initially investigated in more detail in
order to gain the best combination of drugs that can target
both CSCs and differentiated tumor cells. The HCC4006
adenocarcinoma cell line has an EGFR deletion in exon
19 and EGFR amplification with the copy number 5.2,
and shows half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of
Gefitinib at 0.25 µM. NCI-H1975 adenocarcinoma cells,
which harbor both the L858R substitution associated with
sensitivity to Gefitinib and the ´´gatekeeper´´ T790M
missense mutation linked with resistance to EGFR-TKIs,
are refractory to Gefitinib (IC50 > 20 µM). The HCC95
cell line is derived from squamous cell carcinoma with
wild-type (wt) EGFR and an IC50 value of > 10 µM for

that in HCC4006 cells (Figure 1B, upper panel) the
SCMs Nanog, CD133, Sox2, BMI1 and the multi-drug
transporters ABCG2, ABCC1 were higher expressed
(1.6 ~ 5.2 folds) in alveospheres over two-dimensional
(2D) monolayer cells. Similar gene upregulation patterns
(2.3 ~ 6.7 folds) were observed in NCI-H1975 3D cells,
including additional elevated CD44 expression (Figure
1B, middle panel), whereas HCC95 spheres only showed
increased CD44, Sox2, BMI1 and ABCG2 marker
expression (1.2 ~ 3.2 folds) (Figure 1B, lower panel). In
common, Sox2, BMI1 and ATP-binding cassette (ABC)

of CSCs in the tested NSCLC.

examination revealed a substantial decrease of cell density
and cell death induction upon combinatorial treatment
(Figure 2C). More specifically, treatment with 2.5 µM
SAL induced vacuole formation in HCC4006 cells, and
the number of vacuoles increased after co-administration
of METF, whereas either drug alone or in combination
promoted NCI-H1975 cells to a more mesenchymal
phenotype. HCC95 cells are mainly composed of two
different types of cells, which are epithelial-type-cells
directly attaching to the plate surface, and apoptoticlike cells sitting on the top of epithelial-like cells, which
changed to the mesenchymal type after SAL or METF
single application and almost vanished when these two
drugs were combined.
Spheres were considered as an in vitro model
to mimic some aspects of tumor heterogeneity and
hierarchy controlled by CSCs. Exposure of alveospheres
of HCC4006, NCI-H1975 and HCC95 cells to the same
concentrations of METF turned out to be less effective
than 2D, whereas co-exposure to SAL significantly
enhanced METF efficiency (Figure 2B).
To determine if the cytotoxic effects of this
combination are limited to these three cell lines, two
additional NSCLC cell lines, namely NCI-H2122
(EGFR wt, KRAS mutation, LKB1 inactivation) and
NCI-H3122 (EGFR wt, EML4/ALK translocation), were
taken for further investigation. These data confirmed that
co-administration of METF and SAL elicited stronger
inhibition of 2D and 3D cell growth of these additional
cell lines over single treatment (Figure 2D and E). Of note,
alveospheres derived from the NCI-H2122 cell line were
more sensitive than monolayer cells to either drug alone
or their combination (Figure 2D).
To determine whether the combination of METF
and SAL has synergistic or merely additive activity, we
performed isobologram analysis to assess their inhibitory
effects [14, 15]. In our data, specific effects with IC50,
IC65 and IC75 levels have been selected for NCI-H1975,
HCC95 and HCC4006 cells, respectively (Figure 2F).

SAL synergizes METF-induced NSCLC cell
growth inhibition
Out of 12 drugs (Paclitaxel, Carboplatin,
Gemcitabine, Gefitinib, Erlotinib, Afatinib, Sunitinib,
Dasatinib, Bosutinib, Lapatinib, Erbitux and METF)
(Table S1), we found METF modestly inhibited the
growth of HCC4006, NCI-H1975 and HCC95 monolayer
cells in a dose-dependent manner at the 72hrs time point,
as revealed by CellTiter-Glo cell viability assay (Figure
2A). The mean IC50 values of METF were 2.5 mM for
HCC4006 cells, approximately 5 mM for both NCI-H1975
and HCC95 cells, indicating that the Gefitinib sensitive
cell line HCC4006 with the EGFR in-frame deletion
displayed the highest sensitivity to METF. Next we
examined the growth inhibitory effects of the therapeutic
agents in combination with SAL at its IC50. Collectively, in
all three cell lines, the addition of SAL could not sensitize
cancer cells to the 11 therapeutic drugs available in the
clinic; however, SAL potentiated the growth inhibitory
effects of different concentrations of METF (Figure 2A),
as combined treatment caused a significantly greater
inhibition in cellular viability relative to either drug alone
on 2D cells.

These 3 data points showed similar cell growth inhibition
via co-administration of METF and SAL. As indicated in
the isobologram, all dose pairs fell below the straight line,
which reflected a synergistic effect. Moreover, treatment
of these three lung cancer cell lines with SAL synergized
with all indicated concentrations of METF on cell growth
inhibition.
Taken together, these findings suggest that METF,
which modestly inhibits the growth of NSCLC monolayer
cells and alveospheres in a dose-dependent manner,
interacts synergistically with SAL.

mM for HCC4006 cells, 2.5 mM for both NCI-H1975 and
HCC95 cells) strongly induced AMPK phosphorylation
and associated mTOR and p70 s6k downregulation. In
contrast, co-administration of 5 mM METF led to a nearcomplete abolition of the activated forms of these proteins,
and a clear suppression of total protein expression in all
three cell lines (Figure 3). Overall, SAL potentiates the
inhibitory effect of high dose METF, in our case 5 mM,
on NSCLC cell proliferation through unique AMPKindependent mechanisms.

Characterization of EGFR family signaling in
NSCLC cell lines after combinatorial treatment
with METF and SAL

The cell growth inhibitory effect of combinatorial
treatment with METF and SAL is AMPK
independent

To gain insight into the functional role of the EGFR
family in these three pilot cell lines, we examined HER2
and HER3 phosphorylation in serum-starved conditions
with and without AG1478 (specific TKI for EGFR) and
EGF treatment. After 24hrs serum starvation of HCC4006
and NCI-H1975 cells, EGFR and HER2 were still
activated and could be further phosphorylated upon 50
ng/ml EGF stimulation (Figure 4A and B, upper panel). In
contrast, there was no EGFR and HER2 phosphorylation
in HCC95 cells (EGFR wt), except with the addition of
EGF (Figure 4C, upper panel). EGF-mediated EGFR and
HER2 phosphorylation was completely prevented by 30
min of AG1478 pretreatment in HCC4006 and HCC95
cells, but persisted at a high level in the NCI-H1975
cell line, as substitution of a threonine at the gatekeeper
position (T790M) results in a steric hindrance that

METF, as an AMPK-activating compound, is widely
used to suppress cancer cell proliferation. To analyze
whether the cell growth inhibitory effect of treatment
with METF and SAL is also mediated by activation of
the AMPK signaling pathway, several key proteins and
associated phosphorylation status have been evaluated. At
the indicated two concentrations, METF activated AMPK
in a dose-dependent manner in the HCC4006 and HCC95
cell lines (Figure 3A and C), while negatively regulating
phosphorylation of AMPK and the downstream molecules
mTOR and p70 s6k in NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 3B).
These results suggest METF functions as a potent AMPKindependent antiproliferative agent, and AMPK activation
may be due to physiological adaptation to metabolic
stress. The combination of SAL and lower dose METF (1

may interfere with the binding of TKIs (Figure 4AC, upper panel) [16]. In HCC4006 and HCC95 cells
the preferred heterodimerization partner HER3 was
constitutively activated and no further phosphorylation
was observed after EGF stimulation. AG1478 treatment
entirely inhibited pHER3, as well as pEGFR and pHER2
in HCC4006 cells, whereas the blockade of HER3
transactivation was gradually released along the reduced
AG1478 concentrations in HCC95 cells (Figure 4A and
C, middle panel). In contrast, under starving conditions,
HER3 phosphorylation in NCI-H1975 cells was totally
suppressed compared with untreated control cells (data not
shown), and remained so despite EGF stimulation (Figure
4B, middle panel).
Concerning the constitutive EGFR phosphorylation
in HCC4006 and NCI-H1975 cells, we wished to
determine whether the downstream signaling is activated.
In HCC4006 cells, EGFR continued to activate PI3K/
AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling, and AKT and ERK1/2
could be further phosphorylated with the addition of
EGF. AG1478 treatment completely inhibited pERK1/2
and caused a dramatic reduction of pAKT (Figure 4A,
lower panel). In contrast, ERK1/2, but not AKT, was
constitutively phosphorylated in NCI-H1975 cells
(Figure 4B, lower panel). Our findings suggest that the
ERK1/2 pathway is preferentially activated by the EGFR
T790M mutation. AKT and ERK1/2 can be further
phosphorylated with EGF stimulation, but were minimally
affected by AG1478 treatment. In HCC95 cells, pAKT is
constitutively activated in serum-starved conditions as a
result of HER3 permanent phosphorylation, while TKI
AG1478 completely abrogated pAKT and pERK1/2
signaling (Figure 4C, lower panel).
These observations suggest that HCC4006 and
NCI-H1975 cells, with the somatic gain-of-function
mutation and ´´gatekeeper´´ T790M substitution,
respectively, both undergo EGFR-dependent AKT
phosphorylation. However, in EGFR wt HCC95 cells,
persistent HER3 signaling is associated with acquired
resistance to TKIs by permanent activation of AKT.
To further characterize the downstream EGFR
signaling pathway that might correlate with the observed
growth inhibition, we examined the effect of the two
drugs on the expression of several key regulators acting
as biomarkers of response. Using western blot analysis,
a weak inhibition of EGFR, HER2 and the downstream
regulators of signaling AKT and ERK1/2 protein
expression and phosphorylation could be detected
after 48hrs treatment of HCC4006 cells with METF
or SAL alone, in addition to pHER2 inhibition after
exposure to single agent SAL (Figure 4D). In contrast,
these endogenous proteins showed a pronounced
downregulation after combinatorial treatment. As depicted
in Figure 4E, pEGFR was highly sensitive to SAL in
NCI-H1975 cells, and the inhibition of pEGFR and
pHER2 was METF dose dependent. This combinationwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced reduction of phospho-status of EGFR, HER2, and
the mediators AKT and ERK1/2 was further augmented
after co-administration of 5 mM METF and 5 µM SAL.
Cell death development of the tested cell lines was
assessed by PARP cleavage. Here we observed that coadministration increased the levels of cleaved PARP in
both cell lines (Figure 4D and E, lower panel). In HCC95
cells, single-agent treatment with METF and SAL didn´t
show obvious inhibition of total and phosphorylated
EGFR, HER2, AKT and ERK1/2; however, the activated
forms of these proteins were highly suppressed under their
combination (Figure 4F).
To corroborate this strong inhibition in an in
vitro tumor model, multicellular alveospheres were
exposed to METF and SAL. Here we mainly focused
on the expression and activated forms of EGFR and
the downstream mediators AKT and ERK1/2. Clearly,
as shown in Figure 4G, alveospheres generated from
HCC4006 cells were more resistant than monolayer
cells, and a distinct effect was observed at 5 mM METF
in combination with 2.5 µM SAL, which displayed
in 2D the inhibition of tubulin protein expression. In
contrast, NCI-H1975 3D cells can defend higher dose
administration, since 5 or 10 mM METF in combination
with 5 µM SAL inhibited phosphorylation of EGFR and
ERK1/2 compared with single drug treatment, but still
not sufficiently to completely block this pathway (Figure
4H). For alveospheres generated from these two cell lines,
more rounds of treatment could be necessary for further
suppression of proteins mentioned above and induction of
cell death. In HCC95 spheres, co-administration of 10 mM
METF entirely abrogated pAKT and pERK1/2 (Figure 4I).

Possible mechanisms of growth inhibition and cell
death induction upon combinatorial treatment
with METF and SAL
To get a broader view on signaling inhibition and
cell death induction after combinatorial treatment of the
HCC4006 and NCI-H1975 cells with METF and SAL,
we utilized phospho-kinase array to investigate the
phosphorylation of 43 kinases and 2 transcription factors
(Figure 5A and B). As mentioned above, these two cell
lines represent different EGFR status related to Gefitinib
sensitivity. In HCC4006 cells, phosphorylation of ten
proteins (ERK1/2, AKT, CREB, ß-catenin, Src, Lyn, Yes,
Chk-2, FAK and P53) was downregulated following coadministration of 1 mM METF and 2.5 µM SAL (Figure
5C). The phospho-status of these proteins became more
notable when we applied both drugs to NCI-H1975 cells
(Figure 5D); besides, ribosomal S6 kinase (rsk) family
member phosphorylation also declined upon treatment in
combination with 2.5 mM METF and 5 µM SAL (Figure
5D). It is worth to note that in HCC4006 cells, activation
of three Src family members did substantially respond

to single agent, the same for SAL alone for treatment of
NCI-H1975 cells. The finding that combined METF and
SAL induced cell growth inhibition, suggests the multiple
roles of this combination in reducing oncogenic effects
of modules involved in EGFR, Wnt, Src and AMPK
signaling, cell adhesion and cell cycle regulation.

METF inhibited SF, whereas their combination prevented
generation of spheres most effectively (Figure 6A).
At a density of 10.000 cells per well, all combinations
especially with 2 mM METF and 2.5 µM SAL showed
statistically significant SF inhibition with ±7 folds
reduction compared to METF treatment (Figure 6B),
and the effect of inhibition was more noticeable when
5.000 cells were seeded (data not shown). Meanwhile,
we noted that combinatorial treatment greatly reduced
or abolished sphere generation under both amounts of
seeded NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 6C and D). Similarly,
co-administration of 50 nM SAL with 1 or 2.5 mM METF
resulted in 2.5 and 3 folds decrease, respectively, in tumor
SF in HCC95 cells (Figure 6E and F).
To confirm these observations, we examined
two other Gefitinib resistant NSCLC adenocarcinoma
cell lines, NCI-H3122 and NCI-H2122, with the same
validation settings (Figure 6G). SF analysis confirmed
that combinatorial treatment caused a dramatic reduction
in the number of spheres derived from these two cell lines
within 96hrs as a consequence of cell death. As an aside,
NCI-H2122 spheres exhibited a large reduction of cell
viability after SAL single agent treatment; however, co-

drugs. Representative images of spheres indicated that in

year [18]. Given a wide variety of therapies to which
cancer cells are refractory, the CSC theory has brought
awareness that eradicating CSCs may overturn the drugresistance after chemoradiation or targeted therapy. In
our study, we did multi-rounds drug treatment on the
HCC4006, NCI-H1975 and HCC95 cell lines (with various
EGFR status) under combination with the putative stem
cell killer SAL and inhibitors for the non-CSC population,
such as chemotherapeutic agents, EGFR humanized mAb
Erbitux, and a panel of TKIs for EGFR, Src, PDGFR, KIT
and VEGFR. The approach of combinatorial treatment
with SAL and other inhibitors targeting both CSCs and
transit-amplifying/differentiated cells has already been
successfully applied to cancers, such as breast [19],

DISCUSSION
In the present report we demonstrate the effects of
chemotherapeutic drugs, TKIs, mAb, and METF alone
as well as in combination with SAL, an agent that could
possibly target CSCs, in NSCLC cell lines. The most
significant proliferation inhibition and cell death induction
activities in vitro have been observed upon combinatorial
treatment with METF and SAL.

pancreas [20] and sarcoma [21]. Unfortunately, SAL
didn´t enhance the effects of the tested drugs (data not
shown), suggesting ABC transporters that are associated
with multidrug resistance may not be effectively targeted
by SAL in these cell lines. These data are consistent with
Larzabal´s work [22], which showed differential effects
of SAL and Paclitaxel targeting CSC and non-CSC
populations, respectively, on lung primary tumors and
metastases. However, a combination of both drugs did not
improve the effect of single therapies. Collectively, of 12
therapeutic drugs available in the clinic (see Table S1),
only METF elicits synergistic effects on the eradication of
both differentiated cells and CSCs after co-administration
of SAL, thus preventing cancer cell recovery in the tested
NSCLC cell lines.

and developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Besides
its circulating insulin-lowering effects that reduce fasting
blood glucose levels, basic investigations demonstrated
that METF also inhibited the growth of various human
cancer cell types, such as thyroid [23], prostate [24],
gastric [25], breast [26] and glioblastoma [27]. In line
with these findings, we for the first time systematically
showed that METF exerted a dose-dependent growth
inhibitory effects on 5 NSCLC cell lines (HCC4006,
NCI-H1975, HCC95, NCI-H2122, NCI-H3122) carrying
various EGFR, KRAS, EML4/ALK and LKB1 genotypes
irrespective of Gefitinib sensitivity. Furthermore, we found
that SAL can sensitize cancer cells to the effects of METF
treatment by enhancing inhibition of proliferation and cell
death development, validated by CellTiter-Glo viability
assay, cell and nuclear abnormalities, and PARP activation
(PARP cleavage). Single treatment, such as METF, at the
concentrations of 0.07, 0.15, 0.3 and 0.6 mM are without
growth inhibition in HCC4006 cells, the same for 0.15
µM SAL. However, in the presence of this combination,
we observed a decreasing trend of cell viability that
is consistent with METF doses. Here we speculated
that, based on its small molecular property, METF, at a
concentration less than 1 mM, could be hard to accumulate
and can be quickly and effectively pumped out of the cells.
Even though it has been proved to have anticancer effect
on various cancer cell lines, the published data indicated
that the minimum effective concentration of METF is 2
mM. In this case SAL which acts as a possible inhibitor
of P-glycoproteins to interfere with ABC transporters
[28] preserves the effect of METF even at low dose.
Whether they are working synergistically as a complex or
individually needs to be further dissected.
Understanding the molecular mechanism underlying
the inhibitory activity of METF/SAL is pivotal to develop
this combination as a novel therapy to reduce the risk of
tumor relapse. EGFR is overexpressed in more than 60%
of NSCLC cases and considered as a driving force in
lung adenocarcinomas [3], so targeting EGFR to inhibit
EGFR-mediated pro-survival and anti-apoptotic signals
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

through the MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT pathways
would be an effective lung cancer treatment. In HCC4006
cells, EGFR was continually activated in serum-starved
conditions and completely abrogated upon EGFR specific
TKI AG1478 treatment (Figure 4A). The question arose
whether EGFR overexpression was necessary to activate
AKT and drive cell survival. We found that knockdown
of EGFR using small interfering RNA markedly inhibited
HER2 and HER3 phosphorylation, downregulated pAKT
and pERK, and increased the levels of cleaved PARP
(data not shown). Jeffrey A. Engelman and colleagues
[29] showed that MET amplification or the EGFR
T790M mutation is associated with Gefitinib resistance
through HER3 dependent activation of PI3K/AKT in
the presence of TKI. A novel finding of our work is that
in NCI-H1975 cells, phosphorylation of AKT is driven
by the maintenance of EGFR, as starving conditions
sustained the absence of pHER3 (Figure 4B). Our data
demonstrate that combinatorial treatment of the NSCLC
cell lines with METF and SAL leads to a pronounced
´´unspecific´´ inhibition of EGFR, HER2, HER3 and
the downstream regulators AKT and ERK1/2 expression
and phosphorylation, via yet unknown mechanisms,
irrespective of the mutational status and protein
expression. Phospho-kinase assay further indicated this
combination worked more efficiently on cells harboring
the gain-of-function mutant p53 than with wt P53,
inducing an almost complete abolition of phospho-serine
residues of P53 in Gefitinib resistant NCI-H1975 lung
adenocarcinoma cell line. The significance of the P53
mutation for the resistance of this cell line has not been
evaluated in our study, however, publicly available data
indicated that P53-R273H could increase the resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs and TKIs [30]. Since FAK protein
and Src family kinases are involved in cellular adhesion
and spreading processes, combinatorial treatment induced
the suppression of their activated forms could suggest that
the cells are less aggressive after treatment.
There is increasing evidence that 3D spheres more
accurately reflect the in vivo microenvironment and are
suitable as a platform in vitro for testing drug delivery,
efficacy and CSC involvement. In our current study,
cell viability and western blot assays both emphasized
alveospheres are more resistant over monolayer cells
upon METF alone treatment or co-administration of SAL.
As shown in Figure 4G-I, higher doses of both drugs
or more rounds of treatment are required to effectively
inhibit alveosphere growth as compared to monolayer
cells. In particular, an increased concentration of METF
in combination with SAL better targeted spheres generated
from squamous cell carcinoma HCC95 cells.
In addition to the above-mentioned, SF assays
have been widely used to identify stem cells based on
their capacity of self-renewal and differentiation in vitro.
Our present study demonstrate that single treatment with
SAL and, to a lesser extent, with METF arrested sphere

generation, whereas their combination significantly
inhibited SF capability and substantially reduced their size
in all tested NSCLC cell lines (shown in Figure 6A-C),
reflecting the suppression of self-renewal of CSC.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the
antidiabetic drug METF synergistically eradicating
NSCLC cells in combination with the CSC killer SAL
could be a promising treatment option for NSCLC patients
irrespective of their EGFR, KRAS, EML4/ALK and
LKB1 status.

Sphere formation assay

Phospho-kinase array

To examine the effect of drugs in the sphere
formation ability, monolayer cells were treated with
METF, SAL alone or in combination for 48hrs, then
trypsinized and replated with 5.000 and 10.000 cells in
ultra-low adherent 96-well plates (Corning, #3474) for
sphere generation with the continued presence of certain
drugs. Over a 4 day period, cells were transferred into
opaque-walled 96-well plates with clear bottoms, and the
number of spheres per well was reflected by detection
of viable cells. For sphere formation, cells were grown

The Proteome Profiler Phospho-Antibody Array
Kit (ARY003, R&D Systems, US) was used following
manufacturer’s instructions. Spot densities were analyzed
using the AIDA software (Raytest, Germany). The
average density of duplicated spots was determined and
normalized for the relative changes of phosphorylation of
43 kinases and 2 related total proteins.

Western blot analysis

Cell culture
The human NSCLC cell lines HCC4006,
NCI-H1975 and NCI-H2122 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), and HCC95
and NCI-H3122 were obtained from Dr. Roman Thomas.
Cancer cells in monolayer were cultured in RPMI1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Gibco), L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin and 50 µg/
ml streptomycin (Sigma, St Louis). All cell lines were
authenticated in 2012 using the StemElite ID System
(Promega, Madison, WI).

Proliferation assays and isobologram analysis

We thank Dr. Andreas Roidl and Silvia Gärtner
for critically reviewing the manuscript and important
suggestions, Dr. Roman Thomas for providing cell lines,
Zoltan Oerfi for his assistant in the synergy quantification
of drug combination and Tatyana Knyazeva for some
RNA/cDNA preparation.

Opaque-walled 96-well plates with clear bottoms
(Corning, #3603) and ultra-low adherent 96-well
plates were used for 2D and 3D culture, respectively.
The number of cells used per cell line was determined
empirically, cells from HCC4006, NCI-H1975, HCC95,
NCI-H2122, NCI-H3122 were seeded at 5 × 104, 7.5 ×
104, 1.3 × 105, 2.2 × 105, 1.2 × 105 cells/well, respectively.
Drug treatments were performed next day after seeding
and proliferation was measured 72hrs later using CellTiterGlo luminescent cell viability assay (Promega), following
manufacturer’s instructions. As a slight adaptation to
sphere specificity, the mixture was transferred into an
opaque white cell culture 96-well plate after pipetting up
and down 3 times, and incubation time was extended to
20 min accordingly. Each point represents a percentage
of the DMSO treated control. Experiments were set up
in 4 replicate wells and repeated thrice. According to the
Chou-Talalay method for evaluation of drug combination,
the combination index (CI) was calculated using the
CalcuSyn software (Biosoft) and quantitatively defined
the effect between two drugs, with CI < 1 (synergism), CI
= 1 (additivity) and CI > 1(antagonism).
