Abstract
Myeloma cells are sensitive to TRAIL through the two death receptors DR4 and DR5. Because p53 directly
modulates expression of death receptors, we investigated here whether p53 can modulate myeloma
sensitivity to TRAIL. We found that p53 affects the sensitivity of myeloma cells to the DR5 agonistic human
antibody lexatumumab but not the DR4 antibody mapatumumab. TP53 wild-type myeloma cells overexpressed DR5 in correlation with sensitivity to lexatumumab. Both nongenotoxic (nutlin-3a) and genotoxic
(melphalan) p53-inducing stresses increased DR5 expression only in TP53 wild-type cells and synergistically
increased lexatumumab efﬁciency yet did not increase DR4 expression, nor sensitivity to mapatumumab.
Silencing of p53 strongly decreased DR5 expression and induced resistance to nutlin-3a and lexatumumab
but did not modulate DR4 expression or sensitivity to mapatumumab. Increase of lexatumumab efﬁciency
induced by nutlin-3a was related to a p53-dependent increase of DR5 expression. In primary myeloma cells,
nutlin-3a increased DR5 expression and lexatumumab efﬁciency but did not increase mapatumumab
efﬁciency. Taken together, our ﬁndings indicate that p53 controls the sensitivity of myeloma through DR5
but not DR4 and suggest that a subset of patients with multiple myeloma may beneﬁt from DR5 therapy.

Introduction
The receptors DR4/TRAILR1/TNFRSF10A, DR5/TRAILR2/
TNFRSF10B, Fas/TNFRSF6, and TNFR2/TNFRSF1B are
members of the death receptor family (1). Cancer cells, but
not normal cells, are sensitive to TRAIL, making it an
attractive target for cancer therapy (1). However, the
mechanisms responsible for this selective tumor sensitivity
remain unclear. TRAIL binds to 2 different receptors, and it
remains undeﬁned whether the tumor sensitivity to TRAIL is
mediated by both receptors. Both DR4 and DR5 genes have
been shown to be a transcriptional target of p53 (2–4). TP53
is frequently mutated and/or deleted in tumor cells (5).
Although the loss of TP53 or mutations of TP53 are both
associated with cancer, mutated cells have a gain-of-

function compared with cells with a loss of expression
(5, 6). p53 controls many of the pathways of cell homeostasis
(proliferation, autophagy, apoptosis), and its transient activation via numerous stresses allows cells either to survive
the stress or to enter apoptosis (7–9). p53 has numerous
target genes, such as MDM2, CDKN1A, BAX, and DR5, which
are involved in p53 regulation, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis, respectively. It is well known that mutations of (7–9) p53
prevent its transactivation ability of numerous genes including DR5 (2, 10).
In multiple myeloma, as in lymphomas, the presence of a
deletion of the TP53 locus (17p13) or TP53 mutation at
diagnosis has a negative effect on the overall survival of
patients, regardless of the treatment regimen followed (11–
15). Recently, Lode and colleagues reported that 17p13 monoallelic deletion in myeloma cells at diagnosis was associated
with the frequent presence of TP53 mutations (16). Weak or
absent TP53 expression in myeloma cells affects the expression
of numerous genes including DR5 (17).
We previously reported that the human agonist anti-DR4,
mapatumumab, and anti-DR5, lexatumumab, monoclonal
antibodies induced massive cell death of myeloma cells
through the activation of both the extrinsic and intrinsic
pathways of apoptosis (18). This previous study also showed
that mapatumumab was more efﬁcient than lexatumumab,
suggesting that myeloma cells were not equally sensitive to
TRAIL through the 2 receptors. In the present study, we show
that p53 directly affects the expression of DR5 but not of DR4 as
well as myeloma sensitivity to lexatumumab.

Regulation of TRAIL-R–Mediated Cell Death by p53

Materials and Methods
Human myeloma cell lines and primary myeloma cells
All human myeloma cell lines (HMCL) used in this article
have been previously extensively characterized and authentiﬁed (19). HMCLs BCN, MDN, NAN-1,-3,-6,-7, SBN, and XG1, -2, -3, -5, -6, -7, -11 were derived in the Nantes or
Montpellier laboratories in the presence of interleukin
(IL)-6. ANBL-6 was kindly provided by Dr. D.F. Jelinek (Mayo
Clinic, Rochester, MN). KMS-11, KMS12-BM, KMS12-PE, and
KMM1 were kindly provided by Dr. T. Otsuki (Kawasaki
Medical School, Kurashiki, Japan). JJN3, JIM3, Karpas620,
and MM1S were, respectively, kindly provided by Drs. I. Van
Riet (Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium), I.C.
MacLennan (University of Birmingham, Birmingham, UK),
A. Karpas (University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK), and S.
Rosen (Northwestern University, Chicago, IL). AMO1, LP1,
L363, NCI-H929, SKMM2, U266, and OPM2 were from the
DSMZ, and RPMI8226 was from American Type Culture
Collection. HMCLs were cultured in RPMI-1640 containing
5% fetal calf serum (FCS) and in the presence of 3 ng/mL IL-6
(Novartis Pharmaceuticals) for ANBL-6, BCN, MDN, NANs,
SBN, and XGs. Blood or bone marrow samples from patients
with multiple myeloma at diagnosis were collected after
informed consent at the Department of Hematology at
University Hospital of Nantes (Nantes, France) or at the
Intergroupe Francophone du Myelome. Plasma cells were
obtained after density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll
Hypaque and puriﬁcation with CD138 immunomagnetic
beads (Miltenyi Biotech). In all cases, the purity of the
plasma cells was higher than 90%, as assessed by morphology. Puriﬁed cells were cultured for 24 hours in RPMI-1640
containing 10% FCS and 3 ng/mL IL-6.
TP53 cDNA sequencing
Sequencing of TP53 cDNAs was conducted on 2 overlapping
reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
products. The extraction of RNAs and reverse transcription
were conducted as described previously (20). The primers used
for PCR assays contained the following sequences: 50 -ATGGAGGAGCCGCAGTCA3-0 , 50 -GGCCTCCGGTTCATGCCG3-0
for ampliﬁcation codon 1–250 and 50 -GGCCCCTCCTCAGCATCT3-0 , 50 -TCCCCATCCTCCCCA3-0 for ampliﬁcation codon
187–370. cDNA sequencing was conducted using the PlateForme de Sequençage-Genotypage OUEST Genopole. Nine
HMCLs express a wild-type TP53 (TP53Wt) and 22 HMCLs
express an abnormal TP53 (TP53Abn). Of these, 2 HMCLs have
no TP53 expression (TP53KO), 5 have a structurally abnormal
TP53 (TP53trunc:exon deletion, intron insertion, stop codon),
and 15 have a missense point mutation (TP53mut). Only 2
HMCLs with a TP53mut express a wild-type allele (TP53wtþmut,
KMM1, and NAN3).
Gene expression proﬁling
Gene expression proﬁling of HMCLs has been reported
previously (19) and deposited in the ArrayExpress database
(accession numbers E-TAM-937 and E-TAM-1088). Gene
expression data of HMCLs and primary myeloma cells
were analyzed with RAGE (http://rage.montp.inserm.fr/) and

www.aacrjournals.org

Amazonia (http://amazonia.montp.inserm.fr/) bioinformatics
platforms (21).
Reagents and antibodies
Human mapatumumab and lexatumumab mAbs were provided by Human Genome Sciences. Apo2.7-PE, CD138-PE, and
IgG1-PE mAbs were purchased from BD Biosciences, and antiDR4-PE and anti-DR5-PE were purchased from eBioscience.
Cell death assays
The cytometric evaluation of cell death in HMCLs was
conducted using the combined analysis of APO2.7 staining
and the altered cellular morphology characteristic of apoptosis
[lower forward scatter (FSC)-H and higher side scatter (SSC)H] as described previously (18). Cell death of primary myeloma
cells was measured via the loss of CD138 staining, which is
characteristic of myeloma apoptosis (22).
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays
Protein expression was conducted by Western blotting as
described previously (18). The following antibodies were used:
p53 (Oncogene Science), DR4 (Eurobio-Abcys), DR5 (Millipore
Bioscience Research Reagents), MDM2 (R&D Systems), NOXA
(Alexis Biotech), caspase-3 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), caspase 8 (Cell Signaling), caspase-9 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology),
PUMA (Calbiochem, Merck), Bax (Immunotech, Beckman
Coulter), and actin (Millipore Bioscience Research Reagents).
Immunoprecipitation assays were conducted in cells treated
up to 90 minutes with 10 mg/mL mapatumumab or lexatumumab or in untreated cells (control). Cells were lysed 40 for
minutes on ice in 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH ¼ 7.6, 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride, 2 mg/mL aprotinin, 1% digitonin. For control assays,
mapatumumab or lexatumumab (10 mg) was added to the
lysates. The lysates were immunoprecipitated with a mix of
proteins A and G (2 mg of lysate proteins were immunoprecipitated in each assay).
TP53 silencing
A stably modiﬁed myeloma cell line was obtained via
lentiviral cell transduction. The TP53Wt cell line NCI-H929 was
transduced with a lentivirus carrying short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) control or an shRNA designed to knockdown p53
(CCGGGTCCAGATGAAGCTCCCAGAACTCGAGTTCTGGGAGCTTCATCTGGACTTTTT, RefSeq NM_000546; SigmaAldrich). Cells were plated in a 24-well plate (200,000 cells per
mL) and infected with lentivirus (multiplicity of infection ¼ 2).
Selection with puromycin (4 mg/mL) was started 4 days after
infection. Silenced HMCLs were stable and cultured under the
continuous pressure of puromycin.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was conducted using the ChIP-Hit Express Kit purchased from Active
Motif following manufacturer's instruction. Brieﬂy, NCI-H929
cells (15  106 cells) were treated for 3 hours with or without
2.5-mmol/L nutlin-3a; then genomic DNA and proteins were
cross-linked by addition of formaldehyde (1% ﬁnal concentration) directly into the culture medium. After cell lysis, nuclei

were sonicated to generate DNA fragments. p53 immunoprecipitation assays were conducted by using a mix of 2 antibodies
directed against p53, mouse PAb 240 mAb (Abcam) and rabbit
p53 Ab (Active Motif). Control ChIP assays were conducted
with a mix of mouse and rabbit IgG control Abs (Jackson
ImmunoResearch Laboratories).
PCR ampliﬁcations of p53-BS2 in DR5 gene were conducted
before (input) and after ChIP assays with speciﬁc primers
(forward 50 -AAGACCCTTGTGCTCGTTGT-30 and reverse 50 CGGGAATTTACACCAAGTGG-30 ), which amplify a sequence
of 271pb including p53-BS2 located within intron 1 (2, 23). p53BS2 ampliﬁcation assays were conducted at 65 C with 35 cycles
for input samples (after a 50-fold dilution) or with 40 cycles for
ChIP samples. PCR products were run in 2% agarose gel and
analyzed with Gel Smart software (Clara Vision).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using the Mann–Whitney, Fisher exact, Spearman, ANOVA, or paired Student t tests.
The combination effects between the anti-TRAIL-R mAbs and
nutlin-3a or melphalan were analyzed using the combination
index (CI) method with the CalcuSyn software program (Biosoft). A CI of less than 0.9 indicates synergism, 0.9 to 1.1
additivity, and greater than 1.1 antagonism.

Results
Cell death via death receptors depends on TP53 status
We previously showed that mapatumumab and lexatumumab, 2 human agonistic mAb directed against DR4 and DR5,
respectively, induced myeloma cell death (18). Because p53
modulates expression of death receptor genes, we wondered
whether sensitivity of myeloma cells to mapatumumab and
lexatumumab could be related to p53 status. Nine HMCLs
express a wild-type TP53 (TP53Wt) and 22 HMCLs express an
abnormal TP53 (Supplementary Table S1; ref. 19). All HMCLs
expressing an abnormal TP53 or lacking TP53 expression were
gathered and designated as TP53Abn HMCLs (see Materials and
Methods).
Transcriptomic Affymetrix analysis of HMCLs showed that
several p53 target genes such as MDM2, CDKN1A, BAX, and DR5
but not DR4 were overexpressed in TP53Wt compared with
TP53Abn HMCLs (P < 0.01, Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 1A and E;
Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2). Flow
cytometric analysis of DR5 expression conﬁrmed that DR5 had
a trend to be more expressed on TP53Wt HMCLs (Fig. 1B),
whereas DR4 was more expressed by TP53Abn HMCLs (Fig. 1F),
P ¼ 0.1 and P ¼ 0.03, Mann–Whitney test, respectively.
Lexatumumab signiﬁcantly killed TP53Wt HMCLs but not
TP53Abn HMCLs (median cell death 40% vs. 6%; P ¼ 0.001,
Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 1C) in correlation with the level of
DR5 expression (P ¼ 0.001, Spearman test; Fig. 1D). TP53Abn
HMCLs were more sensitive to mapatumumab than TP53Wt
HMCLs (Fig. 1G; median cell death 57.5% vs. 7%, P ¼ 0.005,
Mann–Whitney test) in correlation with the level of DR4
expression (P ¼ 0.014, Spearman test; Fig. 1H). Not surprisingly,
no correlations were found between DR5 expression and
mapatumumab efﬁciency or between DR4 expression and
lexatumumab efﬁciency (data not shown, P > 0.2).

In summary, TP53Wt HMCLs expressed DR5 and were killed
by lexatumumab in contrast to TP53Abn HMCLs, which
expressed DR4 and were killed by mapatumumab.
Nongenotoxic and genotoxic stresses increased DR5 and
lexatumumab-induced cell death in TP53Wt HMCLs
To further show whether p53 could modulate killing of
myeloma via DR4, DR5, or both, we next pharmacologically
increased p53 and reciprocally silenced it in myeloma cells.
We used nutlin-3a, which increases half-life of p53 (Supplementary Fig. S2) by disrupting p53/MDM2 interactions and
induces cell death only in TP53Wt cells (24). As shown in Fig. 2A,
all TP53Wt HMCLs were killed by nutlin-3a, whereas all TP53Abn
HMCLs were resistant (P ¼ 0.0004, ANOVA test). As shown
in Fig. 2B, nutlin-3a (6 hours, 10 mmol/L) increased the expression of DR5 in all 3 TP53Wt HMCLs but in none of 3 TP53Abn
HMCLs. The median value of the DR5 expression level in
treated cells was 230% (range, 137–300) and 111% (range,
89–118) of untreated cells for TP53Wt and TP53Abn HMCLs,
respectively (P ¼ 0.001, Mann–Whitney test). Pretreatment of
myeloma cells with a low dose of nutlin-3a (6 hours, 2.5 mmol/
L) signiﬁcantly increased the cell death induced by lexatumumab in the 3 TP53Wt HMCLs (median value of 38%) but in none
of the 3 TP53Abn (0.6%, P < 0.001, Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 2C).
Melphalan increases p53 and induces myeloma cell death
(Supplementary Fig. S2) through the intrinsic pathway of
apoptosis (24, 25). TP53Wt HMCLs were more sensitive to
melphalan than TP53Abn HMCLs (Fig. 2D; P ¼ 0.0019, ANOVA
test). Similar to nutlin-3a, melphalan (5 mmol/L) increased DR5
expression only in TP53Wt HMCLs (Fig. 2E). The median value
of DR5 expression in treated cells was 139% (range, 119–170)
and 106% (range, 90–114) of untreated TP53Wt and TP53Abn
cells, respectively (P ¼ 0.0002, Mann–Whitney test). Pretreatment of myeloma cells with a low dose of melphalan (24 hours,
1.25 mmol/L) signiﬁcantly and synergistically increased the cell
death induced by lexatumumab in all TP53Wt HMCLs but in
none of the TP53Abn (P < 0.001, Mann–Whitney test). These
data showed that a nongenotoxic (nutlin-3a) or genotoxic
(melphalan) stress of TP53Wt HMCLs enhanced DR5 expression and sensitivity of myeloma cells to lexatumumab.
Nongenotoxic and genotoxic stresses neither increased
DR4 nor mapatumumab-induced cell death in HMCLs
DR4 expression was not increased by nutlin-3a in TP53Wt but
very slightly decreased in TP53Abn HMCLs (Fig. 3A). The median
fold change of DR4 expression level in treated cells was 100%
(range, 89–109) and 87% (range, 83–96; P ¼ 0.001, Mann–
Whitney test) in TP53Wt and TP53Abn HMCLs, respectively. The
cell death induced by mapatumumab was not modiﬁed by
nutlin-3a (Fig. 3B). Similarly, DR4 expression was not increased
by melphalan in TP53Wt but very slightly decreased in TP53Abn
HMCLs (P ¼ 0.006, Mann–Whitney test; Fig. 3C). Pretreatment
of myeloma cells with 1.25 mmol/L of melphalan either did not
modify or slightly decreased cell death induced by mapatumumab in TP53Wt or TP53Abn HMCLs (Fig. 3D).
Thus, in contrast to DR5, DR4 expression was not increased
by nutlin-3a or melphalan in TP53Wt HMCLs and neither nutlin3a nor melphalan increased mapatumumab-induced cell death.

lexatumumab with DR5 expression (D) or mapatumumab with DR4 expression (H). For each HMCL, the percentage of cell death was plotted against the level of

Silencing TP53 decreases DR5 expression and cell death
induced by lexatumumab or nutlin-3a
To conﬁrm the involvement of p53 in TRAIL killing of
myeloma cells, we silenced p53 in the TP53Wt cell line NCIH929. The decrease of p53 expression was associated with
a marked decrease of constitutive expression of several
p53 target genes, that is, p21, MDM2, Puma, Noxa, and DR5
(Fig. 4A and B). The level of DR5 expression in shp53
NCI-H929 cells was signiﬁcantly reduced by 25%  8%
compared with the shcontrol NCI-H929 cells (P ¼ 0.01 paired
t test) whereas that of DR4 remained unchanged (Fig. 4B).
Compared with the shcontrol, shp53 NCI-H929 cells were
signiﬁcantly more resistant to nutlin-3a, melphalan, and
lexatumumab (P < 0.05) but remained resistant to mapatumumab (P > 0.09): the decrease of death was of 50%  7%
for nutlin-3a (10 mmol/L), 34%  10% for melphalan
(10 mmol/L), 39%  5% for lexatumumab (6 mg/mL), and

8%  4% for mapatumumab (Fig. 4C). Moreover, as illustrated in Fig. 4D, the increase of DR5 expression induced
by nutlin-3a was signiﬁcantly reduced by 43%  6% in shp53
NCI-H929 cells compared with shcont NCI-H929 cells
(P ¼ 0.008).
Sensitivity of myeloma cells to lexatumumab or
mapatumumab is related to recruitment and activation
of caspase-8
In all cell lines treated with either lexatumumab or mapatumumab, the activation of caspase-8 correlated with cell
death, suggesting that resistance was mainly associated with
the lack of its activation (18). We showed that sensitivity of
myeloma cells to lexatumumab or mapatumumab correlated
with the level of DR5 or DR4 expressed at the cell surface,
suggesting that the amount of complexes between DR5 or DR4
and caspase-8 should govern the cell response. Thus, we

lexatumumab for 45 to 90 minutes at 37 C, and immunoprecipitation assays were conducted by adding a mix of protein A
and G to the lysates to immunoprecipitate DR4 or DR5 engaged
by the antibodies. As shown in Fig. 5, cleaved forms of caspase8, 41 and/or 43 kDa (26), were found within the immunoprecipitates of DR4 or DR5 in treated cells in correlation with the
sensitivity to either mapatumumab (LP1, MDN) or lexatumu-

the caspase-8 cleaved forms were associated with DR4 or DR5
in resistant cells (LP1/lexatumumab, NCI-H929/mapatumumab) or in untreated cells (control IP). Of note, despite
cleavage of both 53- and 55-kDa caspase-8 isoforms in the
whole lysates, only the 41-kDa was associated with DR4 and/or
DR5 in the 2 TP53Wt HMCLs MDN and NCI-H929. Immunoprecipitation of DR5 was hardly detectable in NCI-H929 unless
the cells were preincubated for 2 hours with 2.5 mmol/L nutlin3a before adding lexatumumab or mapatumumab. Nutlin-3a

neither activation of caspase-8 by mapatumumab nor the
amount of activated caspase-8 within mapatumumab immunoprecipitation (Supplementary Fig. S3). The data collectively
showed that cleaved form(s) of caspase-8 were only found
within the immunoprecipitates of sensitive cells and that
nutlin-3a increased the amount of caspase-8 within the DISC
via DR5 but not via DR4.
Nutlin-3a directly increased DR5 gene expression via p53
To determine whether p53 directly increased expression of
DR5 gene, we conducted quantitative real-time RT-PCR and
ChIP assays. Indeed, quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays
showed that DR5 mRNA quickly increased after addition of
2.5 mmol/L nutlin-3a. In 3 hours, the amount of DR5 mRNA was
increased by 373%  49% (P  0.01, n ¼ 3) in good agreement
with an increase of 180%  37% (P < 0.05, n ¼ 3) of DR5
expression at the cell surface (Supplementary Fig. S4A). To

further conﬁrm that p53 was directly involved, p53 ChIP assays
were conducted in untreated and nutlin-3a-treated NCI-H929
cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4B, nutlin-3a strongly
increased the amount of p53 bound to p53-BS2 in DR5 gene.
Primary myeloma cells without del17p were sensitive to
nutlin-3a and lexatumumab
To study whether p53 could modulate lexatumumab killing
of primary cells, we assessed whether DR5 expression was
linked to TP53 abnormalities. Indeed, primary myeloma cells
with a TP53 deletion constitutively underexpressed the p53
target genes CDKN1A, MDM2, BAX, and DR5 but not DR4
(Supplementary Table S2). Thus, we assessed the sensitivity
of primary myeloma cells to nutlin-3a, lexatumumab, and
mapatumumab in 13 samples in relation to chromosome
17p deletion (Table 1). Myeloma cells were incubated for
24 hours with or without nutlin-3a (10 mmol/L), lexatumumab
(6 mg/mL), or mapatumumab (6 mg/mL), as indicated in Fig. 6.

6A) and by direct staining, respectively (Fig. 6B). In contrast to
HMCLs, abnormalities of TP53 are not found within 100% of
myeloma cells but in a minority or majority of them. Samples
with less than 20% of myeloma cells with a del17p were
considered as del17p whereas those with more than 75%
were considered as del17pþ. Myeloma cells were heterogeneously sensitive to nutlin-3a, lexatumumab, or mapatumumab with no signiﬁcant differences (Table 1). In del17p–
samples (patients 1–10; Fig. 6C), the combination of nutlin3a and lexatumumab signiﬁcantly induced a cell death superior to the cell death induced by nutlin-3a plus that induced by
lexatumumab (1.7-fold mean increase; Fig. 6C, left; P < 0.001,

(median value, 170%; n ¼ 9; P < 0.001; Fig. 6C, middle). The
expression of DR4 was not investigated in the primary samples,
but as observed in HMCLs, the combination of nutlin-3a with

Discussion
Multiple myeloma remains an incurable but treatable disease, despite the successful introduction of new therapies with
bortezomib and thalidomide/lenalidomide. Multiple myeloma
is characterized by a wide number of prognostic values ranging
from the sera b-2-microglobulin levels to chromosomal abnormalities (27). Among the latter, the deletion of the short arm of
chromosome 17 containing the TP53 locus (17p13) has a high
adverse prognosis (11–14). In primary cells, monoallelic deletion of chromosome 17p is not frequent at diagnosis, ranging
from 7% to 25% depending on reports, but it increases with the
successive relapses (28–32). In contrast, del17p13 is frequent in
extramedullary diseases such as plasma cell leukemia (83% in
secondary plasma cell leukemia), multiple myeloma involving
central nervous system (89%), or plasmacytoma (28, 33–35).
Mutations of TP53 at diagnosis are found in patients with
advanced or aggressive disease, especially in those with 17p

in LP1, MDN, and NCI-H929 cells. Cells (20  10 ) were incubated with or

NCI-H929, cells were pretreated for 2 hours with 2.5mmol/L nutlin-3a (N)
before addition of lexatumumab. The lysates were immunoprecipitated
with a mix of proteins A and G (2 mg of lysate proteins were
immunoprecipitated in each assay). For untreated cells, IP was
conducted after addition of mapatumumab or lexatumumab to the
lysates. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed for the presence of the

deletion (36). This ﬁnding is in good agreement with the strong
expression of p53 in tumors of patients with a hemizygous
del17p13, because mutated p53 proteins are strongly expressed
(37). In addition, it appears that the p53 pathway is also altered
in myeloma cells because of the MDM2 ampliﬁcation in cells
with a TP53 wild-type sequence (38). Taken together, these
reports show that the p53 pathway is altered in myeloma cells
as it is in most, if not all, cancers. HMCLs are usually derived
from extramedullary disease with a high labeling index occurring mainly at relapse, although some HMCLs were derived at
the time of diagnosis (19). Most of the HMCLs have a monoallelic deletion associated with a mutated sequence of TP53
(67%). However, 30% of HMCLs have a wild-type TP53 arguing

www.aacrjournals.org

against a full association between extramedullary disease and
TP53 deletion and/or mutation.
In this report, we show that the HMCLs with abnormal TP53
sequence underexpressed transcriptional target genes of p53,
that is, MDM2, CDKN1A, BAX, and DR5. These genes were also
underexpressed in primary myeloma cells with a low TP53
expression corresponding to a TP53 deletion (17). DR5 and Bax
are involved in the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways of apoptosis, respectively, and their underexpression suggests that
myeloma cells expressing an abnormal p53 should be more
resistant to apoptosis through both pathways. Indeed, we show
that TP53Abn HMCLs are signiﬁcantly more resistant to melphalan, which triggers the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis (25).
All TP53Wt HMCLs were sensitive to nutlin-3a, whereas all
TP53Abn HMCLs were resistant. These results conﬁrm a previous study that showed that 2 TP53Wt HMCLs were sensitive to
nutlin-3a whereas 4 TP53Abn HMCLs were resistant (24). Of
interest, we show that HMCLs expressing both a wild-type and
an abnormal TP53 (KMM1 and NAN3) were resistant to nutlin3a too, showing that the mutations exert a dominant-negative
effect. The silencing of p53 signiﬁcantly decreased the cell
death induced by nutlin-3a or melphalan, showing that p53
plays a role in cell response. The p53-dependent molecular
mechanisms of cell death induced by nutlin-3a and melphalan
are under investigation.
TP53Abn HMCLs were resistant to DR5-mediated cell death,
in agreement with the underexpression of DR5. This result is in
agreement with that of Xiong and colleagues who identiﬁed
that DR5 gene was modulated upon reintroduction of a wildtype TP53 in a TP53/ cell line (17). Interestingly, the DR4 gene
is not regulated by p53 in myeloma cells, because DR4 gene
expression level is not underexpressed in TP53Abn HMCLs and
because DR4 gene expression was not found modulated upon
reintroduction of a wild-type TP53 in a TP53/ cell line (17).
However, DR4 expression was notably higher on TP53Abn
compared with TP53Wt HMCLs (Fig. 1B). The molecular mechanism supporting this higher DR4 expression on TP53Abn
HMCLs remains to be elucidated. In correlation with the
expression of DR4 and DR5, we show that death through DR5
was rather restricted to TP53Wt HMCLs whereas that through
DR4 was rather restricted to TP53Abn HMCLs. The involvement
of decoy receptors in the response to mapatumumab or
lexatumumab should be excluded, because these mAbs do not
bind to the decoy receptors (39). Exclusively in TP53wt HMCLs,
an increase of p53 expression induced by genotoxic (melphalan) or nongenotoxic (nutlin-3a) stress enhanced both the
expression of DR5 and cell death induced by lexatumumab.
nutlin-3a or melphalan never increased DR4 expression, nor
mapatumumab killing in TP53wt or TP53Abn. Reciprocally, the
decrease of p53 expression by shRNA reduced DR5 expression
and cell death induced by lexatumumab but did not overcome
the resistance of NCI-H929 to mapatumumab and did not
modulate the expression of DR4. This result argues once again
against a direct involvement of p53 in the regulation of DR4. In
a limited panel of primary myeloma cells without del17p, we
show that nutlin-3a signiﬁcantly increased the expression of
DR5 and the cell death induced by lexatumumab. In contrast,
nutlin-3a never increased the efﬁciency of mapatumumab.

NOTE: Primary samples were obtained from bone marrow (BM), pleural effusion (PE), and peripheral blood (PB) from patients at
diagnosis (D) or relapse (R). Bone marrow myeloma cells were puriﬁed with anti-CD138 immunomagnetic beads. Myeloma cells from
both peripheral blood and pleural effusion samples were not puriﬁed because of high plasma cell content. Deletion of chromosome 17p
was assessed by FISH. Cells were treated for 24 hours with 10 mmol/L nutlin-3a (N), 6 mg/mL lexatumumab (Lexa), or 6 mg/mL
mapatumumab (Mapa) alone or in combination as indicated. DR5 expression level was assessed by ﬂow cytometry and expressed as a
ratio of speciﬁc ﬂuorescence divided by control ﬂuorescence. Cell death was assessed by the loss of CD138 expression (see Fig. 6A).

Our data show that TRAIL receptors are differentially regulated. In contrast to Fas-L, but as TNF-a, TRAIL has 2
receptors. However, in contrast to TNF-a receptors, both
TRAIL receptors induce cell death. TRAIL differentially binds
to TRAIL-R as illustrated by the phosphorotioate-modiﬁed
CpG nucleotides, which block the binding of TRAIL to DR5
but not to DR4 and similarly bind to lexatumumab and not to
mapatumumab (40). TRAIL mutants with selective binding to
DR4 or DR5 also showed that binding of TRAIL to DR4 and DR5
involves different amino acids (41). Most tumor cells, unlike
nonmalignant cells, are sensitive to TRAIL, but the involvement of one or the other receptor has not been systematically
investigated. In myeloma cells, resistance to lexatumumab or
mapatumumab is associated with a lack of caspase 8 activation
(18). The caspase-8/Flip ratio has been proposed to control the
TRAIL sensitivity of myeloma cells (42). However, we did not
ﬁnd any relationship between this ratio and the sensitivity to
TRAIL via DR4 or DR5 (data not shown). Moreover, quite all
myelomas are sensitive through one or the other receptors,
excluding a mechanism of resistance involving the lack of
caspase-8 activation because of a high expression of Flip.
Recently, Reis and colleagues showed that the increased sensitivity to a DR4-selective TRAIL mutant was associated with
an increase in the activation of caspase-8 (43). Moreover,
Szegezdi and colleagues showed that receptor-selective TRAIL
variants enhanced the kinetics of receptor activation and that
apoptosis largely depends on the relative amounts of its
receptors (44). In melanoma, Kurbanov and colleagues showed
that the resistance of cells to DR4-mediated apoptosis was
related to the low level of caspase-8 or -10 and DR4 (45). Fan

and colleagues also reported that the p53-independent
increased expression of DR5 induced by the cap translation
inhibitor 4EGI-1 supported the enhanced response of human
lung cancer cells to TRAIL (46). These reports suggested that
sensitivity or resistance of cancer cells to TRAIL is mainly
dependent on the amount of caspase-8/death receptor complexes, regardless of the cancer model. In myeloma, we show
that the cleaved forms of caspase-8, 41 and/or 43 kda were
associated with DR4 or DR5 in correlation with the sensitivity
of cells to mapatumumab or lexatumumab. Furthermore, the
pretreatment of NCI-H929 with a low dose of nutlin-3a highly
increased DR5 as well as the amount of cleaved caspase-8
within the DISC, explaining the cell death increase. We showed
that DR5 increase induced by nutlin-3a was directly related to
the increased amount of p53 bound to p53-BS2 in DR5 gene,
arguing again for a direct relationship between DR5 expression
and myeloma sensitivity to lexatumumab. In contrast, no p53
binding on DR4 gene could be evidenced by ChIP (data not
shown). In myeloma cells at least, DR5, but not DR4, is directly
regulated by p53. Altogether, these data showed that cell death
through DR4 or DR5 correlated with the amount of each
receptor and the amount of caspase-8 recruited within the
DISC. The strong activation of caspase-8 induced by lexatumumab or mapatumumab in myeloma cells argues against a
requirement of the intrinsic pathway, despite its activation.
Indeed, silencing of caspase-9 or bax did not inhibit cell death
induced by lexatumumab or mapatumumab (data not shown).
Recently, phase I/II clinical trials have reported that DR5 and
DR4 agonistic antibodies (PRO95780 and mapatumumab) are
well tolerated in patients with advanced cancers and have

treatment of patients with DR5 agonistic mAb should be more
efﬁcient in combination with a p53-activating drug, only if the
cells have retained a functional p53 pathway. In contrast,
treatment of patients without del17p with DR4 agonistic mAb
treatment should not be more efﬁcient in combination with a
p53-activating drug. Concerning del17pþ samples, we did not
observe that mapatumumab was very efﬁcient, but we could
obtain only 3 samples. Because the correlation between p53
abnormalities and mapatumumab sensitivity was found when
more than 20 HMCLs were assessed, more primary samples are
required before reaching a ﬁrst conclusion.
In summary, we have shown that the death of myeloma cells
induced by DR5, but not DR4, agonistic antibody depends on
p53 and can be synergistically increased by drugs inducing DR5
expression such as those activating the p53 pathway.
