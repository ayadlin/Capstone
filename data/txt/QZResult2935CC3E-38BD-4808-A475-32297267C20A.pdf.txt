development of tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer

The antiestrogen tamoxifen is a well-tolerated, effective treatment for estrogen receptor-α-positive (ER+) breast cancer, but
development of resistance eventually limits its use. Here we show that expression of MAGEA2, and related members of this cancertestis antigen family, is upregulated in tamoxifen-resistant tumor cells. Expression of MAGEA2 in tumor lines grown in vitro or as
xenografts led to continued proliferation in the presence of tamoxifen. At the molecular level, we demonstrate that MAGEA2
protein localizes to the nucleus and forms complexes with p53 and ERα, resulting in repression of the p53 pathway but increased
ER-dependent signaling. In a series of ER+, tamoxifen-treated breast cancer patients, we show a highly signiﬁcant (P = 0.006)
association between MAGEA (melanoma-associated antigen) expression and reduced overall survival, conﬁrming the clinical
signiﬁcance of our observations.

INTRODUCTION
The use of the selective estrogen receptor modulator, tamoxifen,
to treat hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer has had
signiﬁcant positive impact on the risk of recurrence and on longterm patient survival rates.1 Tumor expressions of estrogen
receptor-α (ER) and progesterone receptor are currently the best
predictors of response to antiestrogen therapy. However, all
patients with metastatic disease and 30–40% of early disease
patients will relapse while on tamoxifen treatment owing to de
novo or acquired drug resistance.2
In an attempt to circumvent resistance, additional selective
estrogen receptor modulators and the total estrogen antagonist,
fulvestrant, plus a series of aromatase inhibitors (AIs), which act to
block the synthesis of estrogens in postmenopausal women, have
been developed. However, these newer compounds also eventually elicit tumor resistance.3,4 Several large clinical trials have
compared tamoxifen treatment with newer endocrine therapies,
and, in particular, the use of AIs as ﬁrst-line treatment has been
reported to show improvements in disease-free survival in
postmenopausal women (reviewed in Hughes-Davies et al.5).
However, meta-analyses have suggested that signiﬁcant
improvements in overall survival (OS) may only be obtained by
using switching or sequencing protocols whereby patients
receive tamoxifen for 2–3 years before moving to an AI.6 This
suggests that, far from being surpassed by newer therapies,
tamoxifen remains a vital drug in the treatment of breast cancer,
and therefore studies to further biological understanding of
tamoxifen resistance prolong its clinical effectiveness remain
highly relevant.
In tumor cells resistant to tamoxifen, ER expression is usually
retained and continues to regulate breast cancer cell proliferation
and survival through cross-talk with other signaling pathways,
leading to ligand-independent ER activation (reviewed in Ali and
1

Coombes3 and Musgrove and Sutherland4). Here we have
examined gene expression proﬁles in tamoxifen-resistant (TR)
breast tumor-derived lines and report the identiﬁcation and
functional validation of MAGEA2 as a novel TR-associated gene.
MAGEA2 is a member of the class 1 melanoma-associated antigen
(MAGEA) family of cancer-testis antigens encoded by 12 highly
homologous genes located on the X chromosome. They are
deﬁned by their lack of expression in somatic adult tissues, but
frequent upregulation in a range of solid tumors.7 These proteins
are also highly immunogenic, and their ability to induce
spontaneous cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-dependent immune
responses in cancer patients particularly marks them out as useful
targets for immunotherapy.8 Cancer vaccine phase II trials based
on recombinant MAGEA3 antigen have shown promise for the
treatment of lung cancer and melanoma,9,10 and this has led to
increased interest in the expression proﬁle and activity of these
proteins in other tumor types.
MAGE proteins are characterized by a ~ 170-amino-acid MAGE
homology domain, which forms a tandem winged-helix structure
that can act as a scaffold for protein–protein interactions.7,11 Their
precise biological role is still emerging; however, they have been
reported to interact with key cellular proteins, notably p53. In a
study examining MAGEA2 expression in the acquisition of
resistance to the chemotherapy drug, etoposide, MAGEA2 was
shown to complex directly with p53 and recruit the histone
deactylase, HDAC3, to repress p53 transcriptional activity, thereby
protecting cells from apoptosis.2 In a separate study, a number of
class I MAGE antigens (from the A, B and C subfamilies) were
found to interact indirectly with p53 via another scaffolding
protein, the transcriptional corepressor, KAP1 (also termed
TRIM28; TIF14), again resulting in apoptosis suppression.13 In
multiple myeloma, the interaction of MAGEA proteins with p53
was shown to inhibit apoptosis through repression of Bax and

stabilization of survivin.14 All of these studies have suggested that
tumor expression of MAGE antigens is linked to treatment failure,
prompting us to determine if overexpression of MAGEA2 can
contribute to TR in breast tumors.
RESULTS
MAGEA2 expression in TR breast tumor lines
The ER+ human breast tumor lines T47D and ZR75-1 were
maintained in media containing 10 − 7 M tamoxifen until they reentered the cell cycle and could be expanded. At this point, they
were considered as separate, TR lines. In addition, estrogendeprived (mimicking resistance to an AI), TR (ODTR) lines were
also established (see Materials and methods). Gene expression
proﬁles for these derived lines were compared with wild-type
(WT) cells using Affymetrix arrays, and the data were analyzed
to identify up- or downregulated genes common to the
derived lines.
Several known ER target genes, including PGR, GREB1 and
PDZK1, were among the downmodulated genes (Figure 1a), but

additional genes with no previous link to ER signaling were also
signiﬁcantly regulated. Of these, MAGEA2 showed a consistent
fourfold upregulation on the arrays, which was validated by
quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. On
immunoblotting a panel of TR lines and their WT, tamoxifensensitive counterparts, WT ER+ cells showed little or no MAGEA2
protein expression, but all had signiﬁcant induction in their TR
derivatives (Figure 1b, lanes 1–14). ER − lines are inherently
TR, but most of these lines assayed were also negative for MAGEA2
expression, even when cultured in the presence of tamoxifen
(exempliﬁed by MDA-MB-453 cells; Figure 1b, lanes 17 and 18);
however, the SKBR3 line did express elevated levels of MAGEA2,
which were maintained when the cells were grown in tamoxifen
media (Figure 1b, lanes 15 ad 16). As MAGEA genes are often
coinduced in tumor cells,7 we also probed blots with a ‘panMAGEA’ antibody able to recognize several members of the
MAGEA family. As illustrated for the T47DTR line (Figure 1c),
upregulation of additional MAGEA-related proteins (including
MAGEA10, A3 and A1) was observed in MCF-7 and ZR75-1TR lines
(data not shown).

As induction of MAGEA2 overexpression was a characteristic of
all of our resistant cell lines, we tested if overexpression of this
gene alone could have a functional role in resistance to tamoxifen.
Stable MAGEA2-overexpressing lines were generated in WT,
tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 and T47D breast tumor cells. Several
individual colonies were expanded and checked for MAGEA2
expression (see Figure 2a and Supplementary Figure S1A); vector
alone (VA)-transfected, non-expressing control lines were also
established. Figure 2b illustrates changes in cell number for two
individual MAGEA2-expressing MCF-7 derived lines when cultured
with tamoxifen, compared with WT and VA control cells. There was
a highly signiﬁcant (P o0.01) difference between growth of the
MAGEA2-expressing lines, which continued to proliferate in
tamoxifen-containing media, and the controls, which underwent

growth arrest. Similar results were also obtained when T47Dderived lines were analyzed: the MAGEA2-expressing clones
were again able to sustain their growth in tamoxifen-containing
media (Po 0.001; Supplementary Figure S1B). In addition, we
generated MAGEA3-expressing lines, as this family member was
also found to be upregulated in several TR lines, and these also
continued to proliferate in the presence of tamoxifen (P o 0.001;
Supplementary Figure S2). Similar growth assays were used to
compare the proliferation capacity of control and MAGEA2expressing cells over a range of tamoxifen concentrations or in
the presence of the total estrogen antagonist, fulvestrant.
Expression of MAGEA2 allowed cells to continue to proliferate in
10 − 6 M tamoxifen (Po 0.01; Figure 2c), the highest dose tested;
however, neither these cells nor the controls grew in media

were reprobed for Hsc70 (loading control). (b) MCF-7 (WT and VA) and clones C18 and C24 were split into six-well plates (5 × 105 cells per well)

containing fulvestrant, even at 10 − 8 M, the lowest dose tested
(Supplementary Figure S3).
Proliferation assays in normal media suggested that MAGEA2
expression did not confer an inherent proliferation advantage
(data not shown). We therefore examined if MAGEA2 expression
can protect cells from apoptosis, particularly in the presence of
tamoxifen, which has been found to induce both cytostasis and
programmed cell death in ER+ cells.15 MCF-7-derived control (WT
and VA) and two independent MAGEA2-expressing lines were
grown in the presence and in the absence of tamoxifencontaining media for 6 days and then assayed for surface
expression of Annexin V (AnnV), a recognized hallmark of early
apoptotic cells. The samples were stained additionally with
propidium iodide (PI) to differentiate between intact cells
(AnnV − PI − ), and early apoptotic (AnnV+PI − ) and late apoptotic/necrotic cells (AnnV+PI+), using ﬂuorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis (full cell cycle proﬁle; Supplementary Figure S4a).
When the percentage of apoptosing cells in each population was
examined (Figure 2d), both MAGEA2-expressing clones showed a
signiﬁcantly (P o0.01) lower proportion of dead and dying cells in
the presence of tamoxifen compared with the controls. Again,
similar results were also found for the T47D-derived MAGEA2expressing clones (Supplementary Figure S4B).
As a further functional test, we transiently transfected one
of the derived TR cell lines with control or MAGEA2-targeted
small interfering RNA (siRNA), and then monitored growth in
tamoxifen-containing media over 5 days. Silencing MAGEA2 in
T47DTR cells occurred with reasonable efﬁciency (Figure 2e) and
these cells showed a signiﬁcantly (P o0.05) reduced ability to
proliferate in 10 − 6 M tamoxifen, compared with cells transfected
with control siRNA (Figure 2f). In our gene expression proﬁling of
the T47DTR line, nearly 2000 genes were identiﬁed as differentially
regulated compared with WT cells. Therefore, our ﬁnding that
growth of these cells in tamoxifen is compromised by silencing
MAGEA2 alone strongly implicates it as a causal gene in the TR
phenotype.
MAGEA2 regulates the transcriptional activity of p53 and ER
Published data12 have suggested that, in chemoresistant cells,
MAGEA proteins can interact with, and thereby inhibit the activity
of, p53. We therefore used co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) to
examine if MAGEA2 can complex with p53 in breast tumor cells,
and whether this impacts on p53 signaling, initially analyzing a
T47D-derived line (C30 cells) expressing exogenous MAGEA2.
MAGEA2 was detected in p53 complexes in C30 cells but not in
control cells (Supplementary Figure S5A, upper left panel).
Similarly, p53 was found in MAGEA immunoprecipitates
(Supplementary Figure S5A, middle lower panel), thus conﬁrming
formation of a complex between p53 and exogenous MAGEA2.
Additional western blots demonstrated equal expression of total
p53, but markedly reduced levels of both acetylated p53 and its
downstream target gene; the cell cycle inhibitor, p21cip/CDKN1A,
was observed in the MAGEA2-expressing cells (Supplementary
Figures S5A (right panels), S1A and S5B). The constant p53 level,
but reduction in acetylated p53 and p21cip levels, was also
observed in the MCF-7 MAGEA2-expressing cell lines compared
with controls (see Figure 2a).
A CoIP experiment was also performed to study complex
formation by endogenous MAGEA2 expressed by the T47DTRderived line. This conﬁrmed complex formation between endogenous p53 and MAGEA2 in the TR cells, which again showed
reduced levels of p21cip and acetylated p53, compared with cell
lysates from WT cells, which lack MAGEA2 expression (see
Figure 3a and Supplementary Figure S5B). Consistent with these
ﬁndings, silencing MAGEA2 in T47DTR cells caused levels of
acetylated p53 to rise compared with cells treated with control
siRNA (Figure 2e). Of note here, although T47D cells carry mutant
Oncogene (2014) 4579 – 4588

p53, this mutation (L194F) retains signiﬁcant ability to induce p53
target genes, and this cell line can still undergo p53-dependent
apoptosis.16–19
As acetylation of p53 is a hallmark of transcriptional activity,20,21
the reduction in its acetylation level in MAGEA2-expressing lines,
coupled with decreased expression of the p53 target gene p21cip/
CDKN1A in tamoxifen media, strongly suggests that MAGEA2
protein is able to protect cells from growth arrest by interfering
with the p53 pathway, possibly by altering p53 transcriptional
activity directly. To examine this, p53-null H1299 cells were
transfected with the p53-dependent pG13PyLuc synthetic reporter construct, an optimized amount of p53 expression vector and a
range of concentrations of either an MAGEA2 or an MAGEA3
expression vector. In each case, a dose-responsive repression of
reporter activity was observed as MAGEA expression increased
(Figure 3b). We also compared the activity of the natural p53
target gene, p21cip, in H1299 and HepG2 (p53 WT) cells;
expression of MAGEA2 or MAGEA3 inhibited p21cip reporter
activity only in HepG2 cells, conﬁrming the p53-dependent nature
of the repression (compare Figures 3d and e). Moreover, cotransfection of MAGEA2 and MAGEA3 expression vectors further
repressed the p53-dependent transcriptional activity of both
reporter constructs (Figures 3c and e), suggesting that MAGEA
family members can act cooperatively to regulate p53 activity and
hence p21cip expression.
To complex with p53 and repress its activity, MAGEA2 must
either localize to the nucleus or cause the relocalization of p53.
Control and MAGEA2-expressing MCF-7 cells were grown with and
without tamoxifen and subfractionated to isolate cytoplasmic and
nuclear extracts for analysis by western blotting. As illustrated in
Figure 4a, MAGEA2 protein was detected chieﬂy in the cytoplasm
of overexpressing cells grown in normal media, but was increased
in the nucleus in cells exposed to tamoxifen. This correlated with
loss of acetylated p53, whereas the levels of total p53 remained
constant. Similar observations concerning MAGEA2 subcellular
localization were also made in fractionated T47DTR cells
(Supplementary Figure S5B) and on MCF-7 C24 cells using
confocal microscopy (Supplementary Figure S5C).
Taken together, these data suggest that in tamoxifen-treated
cells MAGEA2 is increased and localizes to the nucleus, which in
turn prevents p53-dependent cell cycle arrest. Another protein
known to be increased by tamoxifen treatment is ERα itself (Laios
et al.,22 and this effect was also observed in our VA control cells;
Figure 4a, ﬁrst 4 lanes). Total ERα and its active form, phospho-ERα
(serine 118) levels were even further enhanced, however, in the
MAGEA2-overexpressing lines, particularly upon tamoxifen treatment (Figure 4a, lanes 5–8), whereas silencing MAGEA2 in T47DTR
cells had the reverse effect, reducing total ERα load (Figure 2e).
Furthermore, our data also indicate that phospho-p42/44
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity is enhanced in
MAGEA2-overexpressing cells after tamoxifen treatment (Figure 4a,
lanes 5–8). As MAPK also regulates ERα transcriptional activity,3,4
these observations together suggest strongly that MAGEA2 can
also impact on ER-mediated pathways. To determine whether
MAGEA2 affects ERα transcriptional activity, MCF-7 VA control and
MAGEA2-overexpressing clones were pre-treated with estrogenfree media for 48 h, and then transiently transfected with an EREdependent luciferase reporter construct in the presence or in the
absence of β-estradiol (E2) or tamoxifen. Compared with observations in VA cells, overexpression of MAGEA2 signiﬁcantly enhanced
the transcriptional activity of ERα in the presence of tamoxifen
alone and reversed the suppression of E2-mediated activation in
cells treated with both reagents (Figure 4b). Further CoIP assays
were then performed to investigate if MAGEA2 and ERα are able
to form a complex in these cells. As illustrated in Figure 4c, ERα
was found in MAGEA2 immunoprecipitates and MAGEA2 was
found in ERα precipitates, conﬁrming that these two proteins can
associate, in particular, with tamoxifen-treated cells. Again, this

absence of E2 supplementation, VA control cells were unable to
form tumors, whereas MAGEA2-expressing cells formed small
tumors (Figure 5b).

E2-induced tumors. In agreement with the cell culture assays, the
growth of MAGEA2-overexpressing tumors was not inhibited by
tamoxifen, whereas the control tumors regressed upon tamoxifen
treatment (Po 0.05; Figure 5a). One cohort of mice was implanted
with tamoxifen pellets alone. Surprisingly, tamoxifen supplementation accelerated growth of MAGEA2-overexpressing xenografts threefold relative to the same cells grown without
tamoxifen pellets (P o 0.01; Figure 5b). This response may
reﬂect the increased MAGEA2 nuclear expression observed in
tamoxifen-treated cells noted above (Figure 4a) coupled with
activation of ER-dependent proliferation and survival pathways.
Oncogene (2014) 4579 – 4588

Immunohistochemical analysis conﬁrmed the persistence of
MAGEA2 overexpression in the C24 xenografts (Figure 5c). Overall,
our data demonstrate that overexpression of MAGEA2 lowers the
E2 requirement for MCF-7 cells to grow as xenografts and renders
the tumors insensitive to antiestrogen therapy.

MAGEA (35%) all showed moderate or strong intensity staining
with both nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution (Figure 6a). As
noted previously,23 there was signiﬁcant intertumor variation as to
which compartment predominated.
Positive MAGEA staining was associated with a highly
signiﬁcant reduction in OS (P = 0.006) as shown in Figure 6b,
where a marked separation in survival curves is evident after 5
years of follow-up. This therefore suggests a link between MAGEA
expression in the primary tumor and clinical resistance to
tamoxifen therapy, consistent with our in vitro and xenograft data.
DISCUSSION
Although initially identiﬁed over 20 years ago, the functional role
and mode of action of MAGE antigens is still highly controversial.
Here we demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, the pleiotropic effects of
MAGEA2 antigen on ER+ breast tumor cells, leading to their
continued proliferation and survival in the presence of physiological levels of the therapeutic antihormone, tamoxifen.
In TR ER+ breast cancer cells, and lines engineered to
overexpress MAGEA2, we were able to detect a complex between
MAGEA2 protein and p53, which was consistent with the observed
inhibition of the p53 pathway in these cells. Previous studies have
also noted a functional interplay between p53 and several MAGEA
antigens including MAGEA2; however, the nature of this interaction at the molecular level is disputed. Two studies suggested that
MAGEA and p53 proteins do not interact directly but via binding
to different regions of RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domaincontaining proteins, particularly in the transcriptional corepressor,
KAP1 (also termed TRIM28, TIF-1β). The association with KAP1 has

been suggested variously to recruit histone deactylases to p53,13
or to lead to p53 ubiquitination and degradation.11 In contrast,
others have used p53-derived peptides or bacterially made
proteins to map a direct interaction between MAGEA antigens
and the DNA-binding surface of p53.12,24 Using published
reagents, we have not been able to detect an interaction between
MAGEA2 and KAP1 or histone deactylases in the breast tumor
lines studied here (unpublished data), nor did we see any
reduction in either WT or mutant p53 levels in a range
of MAGEA2-expressing breast lines; however, we did observe a
clear diminution in the level of p53 acetylation both in MAGEA2overexpressing cells and in lines selected for TR (Figures 2a,
e and 4a and Supplementary Figures S1A and S4A), which was
completely consistent with the reduced expression of the cell
cycle inhibitor, p21cip/CDNK1A, and the continued growth in
tamoxifen exhibited by these lines. Our demonstration that
MAGEA2 represses the transcriptional activity of p53 (Figures 3b
and d) agrees with work by Meek and co-workers24 who linked
MAGEA binding to the p53 DNA-binding domain to a lack of p53
interaction at its endogenous target genes, including p21cip/
CDKN1A, as monitored using chromatin immunoprecipitation. As
found here, p53 stability was not altered by coexpression with
MAGEA antigens. This suggests therefore that MAGEA2 expression
in resistant cells reduces the ability of tamoxifen-induced p53 to
bind to its target genes, resulting in less efﬁcient G1/S arrest and
apoptosis and continued proliferation in the presence of the
antihormone, as observed using cell culture (Figures 2b and d)
and xenografts (Figure 5b). Reduced p53 association with
chromatin will also limit its access to histone acetyl transferases,
thus accounting for the lower levels of acetylated p53 in our TRand MAGEA2-expressing cells. Consistent with this proposed
molecular interplay between MAGEA2 and the p53 pathway, we
have also conﬁrmed that MAGEA2 protein is increased in the
nucleus, and, in particular, in tamoxifen-treated cells (Figure 4a).
Although MAGEA2-expressing cells were found to be resistant to
a range of tamoxifen concentrations (Figure 2c), they were not
cross-resistant to the total estrogen antagonist, fulvestrant. As
fulvestrant also acts as a selective estrogen receptor degrader,
stimulating cellular turnover of ERα,25 this demonstrates that
intact ER signaling is also essential for MAGEA2 activity in TR
breast cancer cells. Using reporter assays, we show that ERα
transcriptional activity is no longer inhibited by tamoxifen in
MAGEA2-expressing lines (Figure 4b); instead, tamoxifen acts as an
ER agonist in these cells. This change in cellular response to
tamoxifen is a hallmark of resistant breast cancer and results from
alterations in the activity, abundance or stoichiometric balance of
ER corepressors and coactivators in TR cells (reviewed in
McDonnell and Wardell26 and Green and Carroll27). Signiﬁcantly,
we were able to show that MAGEA2 and ERα can form complexes
in tamoxifen-treated MAGEA2-expressing lines and TR cells
(Figure 4c and Supplementary Figure S6). Given the fact that the
tamoxifen treatment induces nuclear expression of MAGEA2
(Figure 4a), it is tempting to speculate that the interaction of
ERα with MAGEA2 is predominantly in the nucleus, as it is not
observed in non-tamoxifen-treated cells (Figure 4c). At this stage,
the interaction of ERα with MAGEA2 could be either direct or
could involve ER cofactors. Given that our data show an increase
in MAPK activity, which correlates with increased ER phosphorylation (Figure 4a), this pathway may act to aid downstream ERE
promoter activity via MAGEA2 (Figure 4b).
We examined MAGEA expression in a series of ER+ breast
cancers with an antibody validated for use on formalinﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded material,23,28 which detects several
members of the MAGEA family. In our panel of derived resistant
lines, although MAGEA2 was the most consistently overexpressed,
we also readily detected the expression of MAGEA3 and A10 and
to a lesser extent MAGEA1 (Figure 1c). Furthermore, silencing
MAGEA2 alone in these cells led to a signiﬁcant but incomplete
Oncogene (2014) 4579 – 4588

reversal of the TR phenotype (Figure 2f). We have also shown that
MAGEA3 can cooperate with MAGEA2 in the transcriptional
repression of p53 (Figures 3b and c), and lines selected to
overexpress MAGEA3 were also resistant to tamoxifen
(Supplementary Figure S2). Taken together, these observations
suggest that several members of this highly homologous family
can functionally contribute to TR, in agreement with the overlap in
MAGEA activity reported in other studies.12,24
Analysis of our tumor study revealed a highly signiﬁcant
association (P = 0.006) between positive MAGEA staining and
reduced OS (Figure 6b). Previous studies have shown that a low
percentage of ER-positive breast cancers are MAGEA positive.23,28
However, these studies were restricted to cancers that were not
TR. In contrast, although all the patients in our study were treated
with tamoxifen only, 66% of them were TR substantiating our
results. This strongly implies a link between expression of
members of the MAGEA family and failure of tamoxifen therapy.
When logistic regression was used to impute the missing values
(see Supplementary Methods) as an exploratory analysis, both
grade (P = 0.001) and MAGEA expression (P = 0.006) could be
shown to be signiﬁcant covariates with an increased hazard ratio
of 2.027 (95% conﬁdence interval: 1.228–3.345) for MAGEA
expression, implying that patients with MAGEA-positive primary
tumors were two times as likely to progress. Relating these
ﬁndings to the clinic suggests that MAGEA-positive cases are
unlikely to respond to tamoxifen; indeed, from our observations
on MAGEA2-expressing xenografts (Figure 5b), treatment may
even accelerate tumor growth. However, patients with MAGEAnegative tumors could be treated and then monitored for MAGEA
upregulation as a marker of TR onset. In this regard, it is signiﬁcant
that the reliable detection of MAGEA3 expression in circulating
breast tumor cells has recently been described.29 Patients with de
novo, or acquired MAGEA expression could be switched to
treatment with an AI; however, we show here that a selective
estrogen receptor degrader such as fulvestrant may be more
effective (Supplementary Figure S3). Unfortunately, the poor
bioavailability of fulvestrant has meant that its effectiveness
in vitro has, to date, not been replicated in the clinic (reviewed
McDonnell and Wardell26). As an alternative, current MAGEA
immunotherapy regimens,9,10 given either as cotherapy with
tamoxifen or at the onset of MAGEA expression, may be a viable
approach to treating hormone-resistant breast cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
HepG2, H1299 and all breast tumor-derived lines (apart from H3396) were
obtained from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and grown according to their
recommendations. H3396 cells30 were cultured in RPMI plus 10% fetal calf
serum. TR sublines were derived by continuous culture in media
supplemented with 10 − 7M 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (Sigma, Dorset, UK) for
3–6 months until the cells could be expanded. Estrogen-deprived (OD)
lines were maintained in low estrogen conditions for 6 months as
described previously,31 using phenol red-free media supplemented with
charcoal-stripped serum (Sigma), and ODTR versions were derived by
subsequent culture in tamoxifen (10 − 7M). The following lines have been
authenticated (May 2011) by STR proﬁling (LGC Standards): MCF-7 (WT, TR,
C18, C24, VA), T47D (WT, TR) and H3396 (WT, TR). All proliferation assays
were repeated at least two times with the repeats showing similar results;
representative experiments are presented. Media were supplemented with
vehicle, tamoxifen or fulvestrant (Sigma) where indicated. Proliferation and
apoptosis assays were carried out as detailed previously.32

Plasmids, siRNA and transfection conditions
The insert from a MAGEA2 cDNA clone (IMAGE Consortium, clone ID:
8327628) was subcloned into pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Plasmid DNA (with and without MAGEA2 insert) was introduced into T47D
and MCF-7 cells using nucleofection (Amaxa, Basel, Switzerland). Stable
clones were selected in media containing 500 μg/ml G418, expanded and

characterized for MAGEA2 expression by western blot and quantitative
polymerase chain reaction analyses. The p21cip/CDKN1A promoter
luciferase reporter vector and pCMV p53 expression plasmid were
generous gifts from Prof Dennis McCance (Queen’s University, Belfast,
UK). The p53 reporter PG13PyLUC construct was purchased from Addgene
(Cambridge, MA, USA) and the pGL3-ERE-luciferase vector was kindly
provided by Professor Simak Ali (Imperial College London, UK). For reporter
assays, cells were transfected using GeneJuice (Merck Bioscience,
Darmstadt, Germany) and efﬁciency was monitored using the pRL-TK
Renilla control vector (Promega, Madison, MI, USA). All samples in a series
were transfected with an equal amount of DNA with an appropriate
amount of pcDNA3.1 vector added as makeweight. Cell extracts were
harvested at 48 h and assayed by Dual Luciferase assays following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Promega). For siRNA transfection, subconﬂuent
T47DTR cells were transiently transfected using INTERFERin (Polyplus,
Illkirch-Graffenstaden, France) with 40 ng of non-silencing control siRNA
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA; no.1022076) or On Target Plus Smartpool
MAGEA2 targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, Lafayette, CO, USA; no. 00635001).

Gene expression proﬁling and data analysis
RNA was extracted from log-phase T47DTR, ZR75-1TR, ODT47DTR and
ODZR75-1TR cells using TRIZOL reagent (Invitrogen) and puriﬁed over an
RNeasy Mini column (Qiagen), including the DNAse I digestion step. Total
RNA (5 μg) was prepared for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays following the manufacturer's
recommendations. The data can be viewed at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo using accession number GSE22664. Details regarding data
handling and analysis of differential gene expression compared with
WT lines are given in the Supplementary information.

Western blotting
Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and scraped into chilled
lysis buffer (8 M urea, 1 M thiourea, 0.5% CHAPS (3-((3-cholamidopropyl)
dimethylammonio)-1-propanesulfonate), 50 μM dithiothreitol and 24 μM spermine). Lysates were assayed for protein using Bradford reagent (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA), resolved by denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and then electroblotted onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Proteins
were detected with antibodies to: pan-MAGEA (clone 6C1; Santa Cruz,
Dallas, TX, USA; sc-20034), MAGEA2 (sc-130164), MAGEA3 (sc-130809), p53
(DO1, sc-126), acetylated(Ac)-p53 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA; no.
2525), lamin A/C (Cell Signaling; no. 4477), p21cip (Cell Signaling; no. 2946),
ERα (sc-56833), phospho-ERα (Ser 118) (Cell Signaling, no. 2511), p42/44
MAPK (Cell Signaling; no. 9102), phospho-p42/44 MAPK (Cell Signaling; no.
4370), actin (sc-130301) or Hsc 70 (sc-65521), and visualized with ECL
chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham, Buckinghamshire, UK).

CoIP assays
Immunoprecipitation was carried out using the Immunoprecipitation Kit
(Invtirogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Brieﬂy, cells were
lysed in buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.6), 170 mM NaCI, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 0.5% NP40, 1 mM dithiothreitol) supplemented with 5 μM
trichostatin A and protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
Cell lysate (1 mg) was incubated with 50 μl of Dynabeads (Invitrogen) and
either 2 μg anti-p53 (DO1), 4 μg anti-pan-MAGEA, 4 μg anti-ERα or control
immunoglobulin G (Santa Cruz; sc-2027) overnight at 4 °C. The next day,
immunoprecipitates were washed three times with the wash buffer
(Invitrogen) for 5 min at 4 °C, and resuspended in 45 μl of 2 × sodium
dodecyl sulfate western loading buffer. The samples were resolved via
sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes and protein detection
was achieved by western blotting.

Xenograft studies
Control (VA) or MAGEA2-expressing (C24) MCF-7 cells were suspended in
matrigel and injected subcutaneously (5 × 106 cells per mouse) in opposite
ﬂanks of 6–8-week-old ovariectomized athymic mice (Harlan, Oxfordshire, UK).
Subcutaneous implantation with E2 pellets (17E2 0.25 mg, 60-day release;
Innovative Research, Novi, MI, USA; 20 mice) or tamoxifen pellets (25 mg, 21day release pellet, 10 mice) occurred a day before cell inoculation. A further 10
mice were not implanted with any pellets. After 3 weeks, 10 of the estrogentreated mice were additionally implanted with tamoxifen pellets. Tamoxifen

pellets were replaced by reinsertion on day 21. Tumor size was measured in
three dimensions in millimeters weekly and tumor volumes were calculated
according to the formula: volume = π/6 × (length × width × height) and
expressed in mm3. For histological analysis, dissected tumors were ﬁxed
overnight in formaldehyde, sectioned and stained with the pan-MAGE
antibody C61.

Clinical material
Parafﬁn sections from formalin-ﬁxed primary tumors from 144 patients
with a conﬁrmed diagnosis of ER+ breast cancer were analyzed from three
separate cohorts as follows: 74 cases from the EORTC 10850/1 trials33,34 at
Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital (London, UK); 32 cases identiﬁed from
clinical records (by CCY and JLJ) of patients from Bart’s and the London
Hospital (BLT); 38 cases representing a subset of ER+ cases from a series
collected at St James’ University Hospital (Leeds, UK).35 All patients were
operated on for their primary tumor and received adjuvant tamoxifen
treatment for an average of 62 months (BLT and Leeds cases; Guys and
St Thomas’ Hospital cases received tamoxifen for life) or until relapse when
patients were switched to a range of chemotherapeutic regimens.
Clinicopathological details are given in Supplementary Table S1.

Immunohistochemistry
For the BLT cases, a tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from routinely
ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded tumor blocks taking 3 × 0.5 mm2 cores selected
from representative tumor areas. A TMA for the Leeds cases was already
available;35 the Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital cases were examined on
whole sections. Sections from MCF-7 WT and C24 cell pellets embedded in
parafﬁn were used as negative and positive controls, respectively. Sections
were dewaxed and rehydrated using standard methods and antigen
retrieval was performed by pressure cooking with antigen unmasking
solution (Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK; H-3300). The pan-MAGEA mouse
monoclonal antibody 6C1 was applied at 1:100 dilution for 40 min at room
temperature. Slides were then processed using a DAKO autostainer and
Vectastain Elite (Vector Labs, PK-6200) with DAB (3,30 -diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride) as chromogen and then counterstained. MAGEA
staining was scored by two pathologists. Staining was either homogeneously positive throughout the tumor, both cytoplasmic and nuclear, or
absent (see Figure 6a).

Statistical analysis
Survival curves were calculated by Kaplan–Meier method for the clinical
study. Student’s t-test was used for growth curves. All P-values were twosided; Po0.05 was considered signiﬁcant.

Research ethics
All studies in mice were performed under license and followed UK Home
Ofﬁce regulations. Access to patient samples for immunohistochemistry
was via ethical approval granted by the East London and City Research
Ethics Committee (LREC Ref: 06/Q0603/25; Guys and St Thomas’ Hospital
