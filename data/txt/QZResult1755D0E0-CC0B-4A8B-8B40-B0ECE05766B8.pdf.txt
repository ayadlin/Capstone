ABSTRACT
Prostate cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in men, and
androgen deprivation therapy still represents the primary treatment for prostate
cancer patients. This approach, however, frequently fails and patients develop
castration-resistant prostate cancer, which is almost untreatable.
Cancer cells are characterized by a hierarchical organization, and stem/
progenitor cells are endowed with tumor-initiating activity. Accumulating evidence
indicates that prostate cancer stem cells lack the androgen receptor and are, indeed,
resistant to androgen deprivation therapy. In contrast, these cells express classical (α
and/or β) and novel (GPR30) estrogen receptors, which may represent new putative
targets in prostate cancer treatment.
In the present review, we discuss the still-debated mechanisms, both genomic
and non-genomic, by which androgen and estradiol receptors (classical and novel)
mediate the hormonal control of prostate cell stemness, transformation, and the
continued growth of prostate cancer. Recent preclinical and clinical findings obtained
using new androgen receptor antagonists, anti-estrogens, or compounds such as
enhancers of androgen receptor degradation and peptides inhibiting non-genomic
androgen functions are also presented. These new drugs will likely lead to significant
advances in prostate cancer therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Since the first observation on the role of androgens
in PC progression [2] and the subsequent cloning of the
human androgen receptor (AR) [3], it has been widely
recognized that the androgen/AR axis controls the
growth and development of prostate tissue as well as PC
progression. Molecular studies have extensively analyzed
the mechanism of AR action in PC, thus allowing the
generation of new drugs that inhibit the androgen/
AR axis in PC. Among them, ADT still represents the
major therapeutic option for advanced PC [4]. Although
initially effective in blocking tumor growth, this approach
frequently fails and the disease progresses to castrationresistant PC (CRPC). A large number of preclinical and
clinical studies are aimed at optimizing the timing of ADT
and investigating the molecular basis for PC progression

Prostate cancer (PC) represents the most common
type of cancer among male individuals and is the second
leading cause of cancer death in men. In most cases, PC
has a slow and symptom-free growth, whereas in the
remaining cases it is more aggressive. Current treatments
for clinically localized or advanced PC include radical
prostatectomy, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT),
radiation therapy, brachytherapy and cryotherapy.
However, the efficacy of these therapies still remains
unsatisfactory [1]. New therapeutic approaches are,
therefore, needed to efficiently hinder PC progression and
metastasis.

and hormone resistance.
Stem cells (SCs) are present in normal tissues
and have the ability to self-renew and differentiate into
tissue-specific progeny [5, 6]. Cancer may arise from cells
that have the capacity to initiate tumor growth. These
cancer-initiating cells, or cancer stem cells (CSCs), may
not necessarily be SCs in normal tissues, but may be
progenitor cells susceptible to malignant transformation
[7]. A particular subset of stem-like cells, defined as
cancer-repopulating cells, may constitute a reservoir
of self-sustaining cells that self-renew and maintain the
tumor. They preferentially reside in specific hypoxic
microenvironment-niches inside tumors, often escape
from therapies, and are capable of metastatic spreading.
A number of reports described the isolation of progenitor
cells/SCs from prostate tissues and cell lines, supporting
the CSC theory [7-9]. PC cells are highly organized,
and only a subset of these cells is endowed with tumorinitiating and long-term tumor-propagating activity,
further supporting the CSC theory. In fact, these tumorinitiating cells exhibit some phenotypic and functional
features typical of normal prostate SCs and are involved
in tumor initiation, metastatic spreading and even drug
resistance of PCs [10]. Thus, prostate CSCs may partly
account for PC development and progression as well as
the refractory state of PC to currently available therapies.
Prostate SCs and CSCs exhibit a robust ability to
self-renew in the absence of appreciable amounts of
AR [11-13]. Their number significantly increases after
bicalutamide (Casodex) treatment or AR-siRNA of various
PC cells [14], suggesting that chemical inhibition or
absence of AR enhances the self-renewal ability of CSCs.
Estrogens also play a role in PC progression. Despite the
absence of AR, prostate SCs harbor classical (α and β)
and novel (GPR30) estradiol receptors (ERs), which are
involved in PC initiation and progression [12, 15].
Here we discuss the putative role of these receptors
in prostate SCs and CSCs. New therapeutic strategies
based on the use of novel compounds (antagonists, small
peptides interfering in non-genomic AR action, enhancers
of AR degradation) are also reviewed, since they might
provide important advances in PC treatment.

cytokeratin 5. Because of the absence of AR, they are
androgen independent. Neuroendocrine cells, identified
by the expression of chromogranin A and synaptophysin,
have unknown functions.
Cell lineage is a key factor in PC development, since
the majority of PCs (95-99%) arise from the luminal cell
lineage, with only 1-5% deriving from the neuroendocrine
cell lineage. Basal cell-derived PCs have not been reported
to date [1]. A well-accepted hypothesis is that individual
cancers originate from SCs or dividing progenitor
cells. A rare population of SCs exists within the human
prostate gland, together with another rare population of
intermediate cells that are likely progenitor cells and
express cytokeratin 5, cytokeratin 8/18 and prostate stem
cell antigen [15].
PC may originate from SCs that become CSCs
as a consequence of accumulating mutations. Thus,
prostate CSCs might arise from SCs or progenitor cells
or differentiated cancer cells undergoing aberrations as
a consequence of genetic mutations or changes in tumor
microenvironment [18]. CSCs exhibit the unlimited
ability to self-renew [10], have a mesenchyme-like
phenotype and express specific surface antigens (e.g.,
CD133 and CD44), useful for their isolation [19].
Relevant to the findings discussed here is the observation
that cytokeratin 5+ stem/progenitor or intermediate cells
increase after ADT or in CRPC [14, 20-23]. Nonetheless,
the identification of prostate CSCs remains controversial,
and their contribution to PC progression is still a matter
of discussion.

AR IN PROSTATE CANCER
The human AR gene encodes for a protein with a
mass of 110 KDa that consists of an N-terminal domain,
a DNA-binding domain and a ligand-binding domain.
The ‘hinge region’, which separates the ligand-binding
domain from the DNA-binding domain, is made up of a
short amino acid sequence that contains part of a bipartite
ligand-dependent nuclear localization signal responsible
for AR nuclear translocation [24].
AR controls the growth of prostate gland and
is a hallmark of PC, since it is expressed throughout
the various stages of the disease [25]. Classically, the
androgen-bound AR enters cell nuclei, binds discrete
nucleotide sequences in DNA and stimulates gene
transcription [24] (Figure 1). Additionally, ligand-bound
AR acts in target cells at non-transcriptional level [26].
Thus, ligand-bound AR triggers rapid and transient
activation of Src tyrosine kinase, increases the active
form of small-GTP binding proteins (Ras and Rac 1)
and stimulates the activity of mitogen-activated protein
kinases as well as focal adhesion kinase in target cells
[27]. Androgens activate these signal transduction
pathways via the direct interaction of AR with Src-SH3
domain [28] or filamin A [29, 30]. Androgens also trigger

PROSTATE ORGANIZATION
Prostate gland is made up of basal, luminal, and
neuroendocrine cells embedded in a fibro-muscular stroma
[16, 17]. Luminal secretory cells, which represent the
major epithelial cell population, express both cytokeratin
8/18 and AR. They are, therefore, androgen dependent
for growth and survival. Luminal secretory cells are
more sensitive to the local microenvironment and more
susceptible to genetic and epigenetic modifications
upon exposure to oxidative stress and DNA damage.
Basal epithelial cells are aligned between the basement
membrane and luminal cells, and express p63 and

PI3-K/Akt pathway activation, thereby increasing cell
proliferation [31] (Figure 1). To what extent the activation
of extra-nuclear pathways by androgens contributes
to prostate transformation and PC progression is still
debated. Some years ago, we synthesized the S1 peptide
that mimics the AR region involved in its interaction with
Src-SH3 domain, thereby inhibiting the growth of PC cells
cultured in vitro or xenografted in mouse [32]. Recently,
it has been reported that PC invasion is stimulated by a
rapid and sustained increase in Src activity, mediated by
non-genomic AR action [33]. These findings indicate that
non-genomic pathways engaged by AR impinge on PC
proliferation and invasiveness. Figure 2A summarizes the
biological responses elicited by AR in epithelial PC cells.
Additionally, our recent results in primary mouse
embryo fibroblasts and NIH3T3 as well as human
fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells provide new clues about the
role of AR. While androgens do not induce significant
cell growth, they do enhance cell motility in these cells
by stimulating AR interaction with filamin A [29]. We

recently obtained similar findings in primary cultures of
fibroblasts from PC specimens (unpublished data).
Filamin A and its proteolytic fragments directly
interact with the 622-670 sequence of AR, thereby
modulating the nuclear import and transcriptional activity
of AR or the androgen responsiveness of LNCaP cells
[34-36]. We recently observed that AR interacts and colocalizes with full-length filamin A in the extra-nuclear
compartment of NIH3T3 and HT1080 cells, as well as in
neuronal PC12 cells. The androgen-triggered AR/filamin
A bipartite complex is required for motility [29, 37] or
neuritogenesis [30] of these cells. These results support
the conclusion that the androgen-triggered AR/filamin A
complex commands motility and adhesion when poised
at cytoplasm of target cells. Of interest, high levels of
cytoplasmic filamin A have been detected in metastatic PC
specimens [38], and a significant increase in filamin A-rich
actin structures localized at the cell periphery has been
revealed by proteomic analysis of aggressive PC cells
[39]. These findings make the extranuclear AR/filamin

Figure 1: Model of androgen action in target cells. The transcriptional and non-transcriptional models of androgen action in

target cells are depicted. Upon ligand binding, cytoplasmic AR dimerizes and translocates into nuclei of target cells, where it activates
gene transcription [1, 4, 24, 80]. In the extra-nuclear compartment of target cells, ligand-bound AR recruits and activates various signaling
effectors, including Src, PI3-K, β1-integrin and filamin A. Stimulation of target cells with androgens triggers cell cycle progression through
AR/Src/PI3-K complex assembly [28, 31]. Androgens also induce the assembly of AR/filamin A/β1-integrin complex. This complex
activates Rac, thereby inducing motility or differentiation in target cells [29, 30]. Under certain conditions, the androgen-triggered AR/
filamin A complex activates the Rac/ dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B) pathway, leading to p27
Ser10 phosphorylation and p27 stabilization. Reversible quiescence of target cells follows [37]. By this mechanism, androgens might offset
the growth-promoting functions driven by oncogenic Ras [37] or growth factors (unpublished results).

A complex a good candidate for invasiveness-initiating
activity and a new therapeutic target in PC spreading.
With the aim of discovering new drugs inhibiting
AR-dependent motility, we synthesized an AC-stapled
(A628S5, K632S5)-amide peptide from the AR 628-646
sequence responsible for its interaction with filamin A, in
which Ala628 and Lys632 residues were each replaced
with an olefinic amino acid that allows them to be crosslinked. The peptide is thus ‘locked’ into its bioactive
alpha-helical fold through the insertion of hydrocarbon
staples. This modification increases affinity for targets
as well as cell permeability, and decreases degradation
of the stapled peptide, as compared to its unstapled

counterpart [37]. The stapled peptide specifically displaces
the androgen-triggered interaction of AR with filamin
A, thus inhibiting motility and differentiation triggered
by androgens in mesenchymal as well as neuronal cells.
Notably, the peptide leaves unaltered AR-mediated gene
transcription, and only acts in AR-expressing cells [30,
37]. These properties make the peptide a good candidate
for further translational studies in view of therapeutic
applications.
Whatever the mechanism (transcriptional versus
non-transcriptional), AR is constantly expressed in PC
and its decrease reduces both androgen-independent and
CRPC types [4]. By enhancing the association of AR with

Panel B illustrates the putative role of AR and ERs (α or β) in prostate SCs or CSCs. With few exceptions [103], AR is almost undetectable
in prostate and PC SCs [8, 11-15, 93-95]. Prostaspheres derived from primary human prostate epithelial cells express ERs (α or β1)
that activate transcriptional and non-transcriptional mechanisms, thus sustaining growth, transformation and stemness [12, 15, 102]. PC
epithelial cells and prostaspheres derived from primary human prostate epithelial cells also express the novel ER, GPR30 [12, 15, 85, 86].

the Mdm-2 ubiquitin-ligase, the new compound ASC-J9
promotes AR degradation, reduces androgen binding
to AR and the consequent AR nuclear translocation.
These inhibitory functions lead to suppression of ARmediated cell growth [40]. Because of these properties,
the compound ASC-J9 has recently emerged as a powerful
new approach in PC treatment.
CRPC is commonly attributed to the reactivation
of AR transcriptional function (likely due to AR gene
amplification or mutation) or AR activation by alternative
signaling effectors [1]. Analysis of AR aberrancies
(amplification, mutations, splice variants) has attracted the
attention of many investigators, because of the possibility
to specifically target the most common AR variants in PC
[4]. AR variants lacking the C-terminal ligand-binding
domain are often expressed in CRPC cells and PC clinical
samples. These variants are constitutively active, and
therefore resistant to traditional ADT. Their expression is
even induced by ADT, making them new putative targets
for the treatment of CRPC [41].

between ERβ/AR/EGF receptor in LNCaP cells [44].
Again, some PC cells are unable to replicate the interplay
between ERα and ERβ taking place at gene transcription
level [45]. These findings partly explain the conflicting
data thus far reported on estrogen action in PC cells.
Again, the most routinely used PC cells do not represent
human tissue, since ERα expression is predominantly
confined to stroma of human prostate, while luminal
epithelial cells express ERβ and AR, and basal epithelial
cells only express ERβ [46, 47]. Therefore, PC cells do
not reproduce the stromal-epithelial interactions known
to be important in cancer development and progression
[48]. Additional findings have, however, contributed to
our scant knowledge concerning the role of estrogens and
ERs in the etiology and progression of PC. Estrogens,
in combination with androgens, induce prostate
transformation and PC progression [12]. Chronically
elevated estrogen levels are correlated with increased PC
risk, and ER expression changes during PC progression.
Testosterone, in combination with estradiol, induces
prostatic hyperplasia and dysplasia in mice as well as PC
in rats [49]. Clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown
that European men have a low risk of developing PC, as
compared with African-American men. PC incidence
is still lower in Japanese men [50-52]. These findings
warrant some further comments. Since testosterone levels
are similar in the three groups [51] and estrogen levels
are higher in African-American men than in Caucasian
men [53, 54], a direct correlation between serum estradiol
levels and PC risk was hypothesized. However, no such
correlation has been definitively proved [55, 56]. It was
previously reported that excessive exposure to estrogens
during development might contribute to the high
incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia and PC, and

maternal exposure to diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy
enhances prostatic metaplasia in male offspring [57].
Based on these and other findings, it was argued that
prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol increases PC risk
[58]. Studies in rodent models confirmed that exposure
to diethylstilbestrol or pharmacologic levels of estradiol
in utero enhance susceptibility to PC [59-62]. Use of
diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy was finally stopped in
the 1970s. Nevertheless, other endocrine disruptors with
estrogenic activity are implicated in PC risk. Bisphenol
A, for instance, influences prostate transformation and
proliferation in rodent models and human prostate cell
lines. It is also involved in progression of PC expressing
AR variants [15]. Further evidence supports a role for
estradiol in PC. PC incidence increases during aging,
when serum testosterone levels decline but estrogen levels
remain constant, suggesting that the estradiol/testosterone
ratio, rather than serum levels of each steroid, is critical
in PC development [63]. These findings raise many
concerns. Firstly, how and when do estradiol levels rise in
aging males? Multiple estrogen sources may account for
this increase. Adipose tissue represents a de novo estrogen
source [64] and aging males exhibit an increase in femaletype fat deposition that might promote PC. Again, estrogen
levels might locally increase in PC [65]. Secondly, many
labs have detected a significant decrease in bioavailable
testosterone and estrogen levels over the male lifespan
[66-72]. The use of different techniques in estradiol assays
could explain the conflicting findings on bioavailable
steroid levels reported during aging. The application of
advanced technologies allowing an accurate assay of
ultra-low and intra-tissue estradiol levels [73] should be
pursued to better address this issue. Further interest in
the role of estradiol in PC has been raised by clinical data
showing beneficial effects of transdermal estrogen therapy
in CRPC patients [74]. In conclusion, depending on cell
type (stem, developing or transformed cells) and PC stage,
physiological estrogens or xeno-estrogens might exert
quite divergent effects.
ERs, α or β, mediate estrogen effects in target cells
[75]. Human prostate expresses both ER isoforms and is
targeted by estrogens. ERα is predominantly expressed in
stroma, while ERβ is detectable in epithelium of prostate
gland [49, 76, 77, 78]. Once bound to estradiol, these
receptors influence cell responses by a complex interface
between signaling cascade activation and control of gene
expression [79]. Genomic effects usually occur via liganddependent binding of ER (α or β) to target gene promoters
[80]. Estradiol action in malignant prostate tissue and ERexpressing prostate epithelial cells involves, for instance,
the nuclear lysine histone protein methyltransferase
retinoblastoma-interacting zinc-finger protein 1 (RIZ 1), a
downstream effector of estrogen in estradiol-target tissues.
In prostate epithelial cells, RIZ 1 promotes prostate cell
maturation and hormone responsiveness. The RIZ 2
variant form lacks the histone methyltransferase domain,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

and likely induces hormone independence and malignancy
of prostate tissue [81].
ERs also induce rapid, non-genomic effects
independently of RNA or protein synthesis. Thus, ERs
localized in the extra-nuclear compartment of target
cells activate signal transduction pathways involving
Src, MAPKs, adenylyl cyclase and PI3-K, or mediate
a rapid increase in intracellular calcium levels [27]. We
also reported that rapid estradiol action mediated by ERβ
drives cell cycle progression and proliferation in LNCaP
cells [28]. Similarly, extra-nuclear action mediated by
ERβ positively affects proliferation and motility of
PC cells challenged with EGF, suggesting that ERβ
intersects growth factors and their cognate receptors in
PC cells [44]. The finding that isoforms 2 and 5 of ERβ
positively correlate with invasiveness and poor prognosis
in PC patients [82] is consistent with data obtained in
our lab. Nevertheless, it has also been shown that ERβ
activation induces apoptosis in prostatic stromal, luminal
and castration-resistant basal epithelial cells of estrogendeficient aromatase knockout mice. ERβ activation also
causes apoptosis in Gleason grade 7 xenografted tissues
as well as in androgen-independent PC3 and DU145
cell lines [83]. Additionally, ERα knockout mice do not
develop high-grade prostate intraepithelial neoplasia
or PC [65], suggesting that prostate proliferation and
transformation induced by estrogens is related to ERα,
rather than ERβ. Figure 2A depicts the action mediated by
ERs (α or β) in epithelial PC cells.
The conflicting evidence on the role of ERs (α or β)
collected so far in different experimental conditions (i.e.,
immune-depressed mouse and xenograft models, normal
or transformed cultured cells, PC biopsies) suggests that
further analysis of ERα or β action should be carried out
to gain valuable findings in relation to PC. The scenario
seems to be even more complex because of the putative
role of the novel ER, GPR30 in PC progression and
androgen resistance. GPR30 contributes to physiological
effects elicited by estrogens in target cells. In addition to
mediating some of the rapid signaling events on estradiol
stimulation (e.g., calcium mobilization and kinase
activation), GPR30 also regulates gene transcription [84].
A role for GPR30 in PC has been also reported. Activation
of GPR30 by the non-estrogenic ligand G-1 inhibits the
growth of androgen-dependent and androgen-independent
PC cultured cells and PC-3 xenografts in vivo [85]. Again,
GPR30 expression is significantly higher in castrationresistant PC than in androgen-sensitive PC clinical
specimens. Additionally, G-1 ligand inhibits the growth
of castration-resistant but not androgen-sensitive PC [86].
Thus, GPR30 may represent a new therapeutic target in
CRPC. We now appreciate, however, that prostate cells are
sensitive to estradiol, substantiating the use of specific ER
modulators (SERMs), which may be ERα or ERβ agonists
or GPR30 ligands in PC pharmacotherapy. Raloxifene,
a SERM selectively activating ERβ and with prevalent

growth of human PC xenografted cells [87-91]. Overall,

prostate intraepithelial neoplasia [92].

express AR calls for further comments. The use of cell
markers to isolate SCs and prostate CSCs may generate
a mixed cell population, significantly complicating the
identification of pure AR-negative or -positive cells.
Additionally, several normal or transformed cell types
express low levels of AR, making the receptor unable
to dimerize and translocate into the cell nucleus. These
cells have, in most cases, been considered androgen
insensitive because of their very low AR expression
level, and hence the absence of AR-mediated gene
transcription. Nonetheless, they still respond to androgens
with activation of signaling effectors [105]. Moreover,
the findings so far reported on AR expression in prostate
SCs or CSCs do not exclude that membrane AR might
be expressed in these cells. Palmitoylation, for instance,
regulates AR localization at cell membrane [106]. AR
also interacts with caveolin 1, thereby localizing in lipid
rafts within the membrane [107]. Thus, further analysis
using new impeded ligands, biochemical approaches to
isolate rafts and visualize AR by imaging techniques as
well as quantitative immunoreactive plate assay [108110] should be performed in an attempt to reach any
definitive conclusion. In sum, the study of AR expression
and function in prostate SCs and CSCs warrants further
investigation. Table I reports the data currently available
on AR expression in prostate CSCs.
Various signaling pathways are involved in prostate
CSC functions. PI3-K/Akt pathway activation sustains
survival and proliferation of PC progenitor cells. Again,
Ras/MAPK and Stat3 signaling both sustain self-renewal
of prostate CSCs [111]. Experimental findings collected
in the last decade indicate that AR mediates activation
of PI3-K and Ras-dependent pathways upon androgen
stimulation of target cells. Specifically, ligand-bound AR
increases PI3-K activity through a non-transcriptional
mechanism in cytoplasm, while it antagonizes PI3-K
activity via a transcriptional mechanism in nuclei. Rapid
activation of PI3-K/Akt signaling by androgens impinges
on proliferation and differentiation of various cell types
[31]. A direct interaction of AR with the p85α regulatory
subunit of PI3-K has been observed upon re-expression
of AR in PC3 cells or androgen stimulation of normal
epithelial cells [112]. Conversely, down-regulation of
PI3-K/Akt pathway by nuclear AR activity has been
observed in prostate PTEN-deficient mouse, human PC
and N-methyl-N-nitrosourea prostate tumor-induced rat
model. In this latter setting, the staining of P-Akt increases
as the amount of nuclear AR decreases [113, 114].
Therefore, it can be argued that when AR cytoplasmic
functions are expanded, the receptor activates PI3-K
pathway, thus enabling PC cell proliferation and stemness.
In contrast, when AR nuclear functions are fostered, the
receptor inhibits PI3-K/Akt pathway, thereby limiting
PC cell proliferation and stemness. In this scenario, AR
intracellular localization might command cell stemness in
PC. It has been consistently shown that steroid receptor

AR IN PROSTATE SCS AND CSCS
Prostate SCs or progenitor cells prevalently reside
in the basal, but not in the luminal layer of human prostate
epithelium. Since basal cells are AR negative, while
luminal cells express high levels of AR, it was previously
hypothesized that prostate SCs express undetectable levels
of AR [11]. This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed
by experimental findings, and many reports indicated that
prostate SCs or CSCs exhibit almost undetectable levels
of AR, or even lack the receptor [8, 12-15, 93-95] (see
also Table I).
A number of markers (i.e., CD133, CD44, integrin
α6, integrin α2β1 and Sca-1) have been used to identify
or isolate prostate SCs or CSCs [14, 96, 97]. Basal cells
exhibit stem cell properties, as shown by their positivity
to Sca-1 in mouse and CD133 in humans. Expression
of AR in these cells is almost undetectable [98, 99]. It
is now largely accepted that androgen sensitivity and
AR expression in prostate tissue are both organized in a
hierarchical model in which cytokeratin 5+8- basal cells,
containing SCs or progenitors, lack AR. In contrast,
cytokeratin 5+8+ intermediate and cytokeratin5-8+ luminal
cells express AR [100, 101]. It should be noted, however,
that stem cells may also be present in the luminal cells of
regenerating prostate [102]. Again, conflicting data have
been reported on AR expression in prostate CSCs. Many
years ago it was reported that CD133+ cells lack AR. In
contrast, subsequent studies reported that CD133+ tumorinitiating cells express AR, as assessed by dual variable
flow-cytometry [103]. However, the concept that prostate
CSCs do not express AR, and hence do not respond
to androgens, has also been corroborated by several
indirect findings. PC cells exhibiting low AR-mediated
gene transcription acquire the ability to self-renew upon
castration [13]. Castration increases the amount of prostate
CSCs [14], and AR-negative PC cells show a very high
proliferative rate, together with stem/progenitor cell
characteristics [97]. In fact, spheroid structures, containing
SCs or progenitor cells, more frequently develop in ARnegative than in AR-positive PC-derived cells [104].
Depleting these latter cells of AR leads to an increase
in the number of spheres and their CSC or progenitor
cell content [14]. In sum, AR differentially regulates the
functions of PC cells or prostate CSCs, since its expression
seems to confer hormone responsiveness to PC epithelial
cells, while its absence or chemical inhibition might
enable acquisition of cell stemness (Figure 2B).

cells [29, 30, 31, 115-119].
Most PC-related deaths are due to metastatic
spreading, and human metastasis-initiating cells (MICs)
have been found within sub-populations of CSCs that often
express the features of epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT). These cells migrate and are putative candidates
for metastasis-initiating activities [120]. However, the
role of the androgen/AR axis in PC metastatic spreading
is still debated. Results from orthotopically recombining
stromal WPMY1 cells with epithelial PC3 cells in mice
have shown that restoring AR in PC3 cells or silencing
AR in WPMY1 cells inhibits PC metastasis. Knockdown
of AR in CWR22rv1 PC cells also enhances invasion
in vitro and in vivo. Re-expression of AR in PC3 cells
decreases invasiveness in bone lesion assay and in vivo
[121]. By inhibiting the AR axis through the release of
cytokine CCL5, infiltrating bone marrow mesenchymal
stem cells increase prostate CSC population and PC
metastatic properties [122]. Again, ADT induces EMT
in normal mouse prostate tissue as well as in human
LuCaP35 prostate tumor explants [123], and the antiandrogens bicalutamide and enzalutamide both increase
invasiveness in different PC cell lines (LNCaP, C81, C42, and CWR22Rv1) and CWR22Rv1 xenografted mouse
model [124]. In conclusion, findings in PC cell lines in
vitro or in xenograft models suggest that the androgen/
AR axis plays a suppressor role in PC invasiveness. In
contrast, much evidence implicates AR signaling in PC
metastatic spreading at early and late stages. AR might
promote pro-metastatic events through derangement
of chemokine/chemokine receptor functions [125]. AR
controls the expression of chemokine receptors as well
as their ligands [126, 127]. CXCR4 is overexpressed
in clinical specimens from both primary and metastatic
PC, as compared with benign controls [128]. CXCR4expressing PC cells migrate towards a stromal-derived
factor-1 gradient, provided that the androgen/AR axis
is intact [127]. However, other AR-related networks are
involved in metastatic events. AR coregulators enhance
invasiveness in vitro and in vivo. Depletion of FOXA1
fosters PC metastasis and increases patient mortality
[129]. Deregulation of the chromatin remodeling SWI/
SNF complex is correlated with AR-driven metastatic
events and the SWI/SNF subunit, BAF57 is significantly
elevated in clinical specimens of metastatic PC [130]. By
modulating the expression of Slug transcription factor,
cyclin D1b promotes AR-dependent metastatic events
in various PC cells in vitro and in vivo. Clinical findings
from CRPC specimens revealed a significant positive
correlation between cyclin D1b and Slug expression,
indicating that the cyclin D1b/AR/Slug axis is preserved
in human PC [131]. Fusion genes and transcriptional
effectors are also involved in PC metastasis. Chromosomal
fusion between the AR-responsive TMPRSS2 gene and
the erythroblast transformation-specific (ETS) gene results
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in a fusion protein, TMPRSS2:ETS, which is associated
with metastatic PC [132]. SOX9, a member of the SOX
transcription factor family, cooperates with TMPRSS:ETS
in inducing metastatic events in PC cells or heterozygous
phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-deficient mouse.
PC patients expressing TMPRSS:ETS often exhibit high
levels of SOX9, a signature that is further increased in
metastatic PC [133]. In conclusion, clinical findings
support a role for AR-driven pathways in metastatic
events. Nevertheless, metastatic PC often acquires
the ability to produce its own androgens, and hence
continuously reactivates AR, despite ADT. Thus, it is not
unexpected that in some circumstances ADT increases
PC invasiveness. Abiraterone acetate, an inhibitor of
androgen synthesis, has been approved for the treatment
of metastatic PC in patients exhibiting disease progression
in spite of ADT [134, 135].
Altered function of extra-nuclear AR-associated
signaling effectors or scaffolds might also be associated
with PC metastatic events. We recently observed that ARdriven non genomic events trigger invasiveness of PC cells
when they transit from hormone-dependent to hormoneindependent status (unpublished data), making the extranuclear AR the culprit for invasiveness-initiating activity
and maintenance of metastatic phenotype. A role for
non-genomic AR functions was observed with regard to
motility and invasiveness of various AR-expressing cancer
cell types (e.g., fibroblasts and PC-associated fibroblasts,
fibrosarcoma, breast, prostate, colon and pancreas tumor
cells) [29, 136 and unpublished data]. Of note, PCassociated fibroblasts enhance prostate transformation,
promote tumor progression and often represent a stromal
‘niche’ that sustains the function of CSCs [137-139].
Although immunohistochemistry analysis has shown that
AR expression is very high in non-malignant stroma, as
compared with PC stroma [140-143], different approaches
(immunofluorescence, qPCR and Western blot) have
revealed appreciable levels of AR in fibroblasts from PC
specimens [144]. Similarly to results obtained in primary
mouse embryo fibroblasts or NIH3T3 and HT1080 cells
[29, 31, 37, 136], we have observed that primary PCassociated fibroblasts express AR, which mediates cell
motility but leaves unaffected cell proliferation upon
androgen stimulation (unpublished results). In sum, it can
be argued that AR directs fibroblasts towards epithelial PC
cells upon a local increase in androgen levels. At this stage,
AR might promote PC metastasis by changing the tumor
microenvironment composition or inducing the release of
stromal growth factors [143, 145]. Finally, a malignant
cross talk might occur between stromal and epithelial
PC cells, enabling the gain of metastatic properties and
stemness traits. Therefore, the functions of stromal AR and
epithelial-stroma interactions should be more extensively
explored in the light of their role in prostate CSC behavior
and PC therapeutic approaches. In most cases, current
therapies for PC only target the functions of epithelial

AR and often produce unwanted effects. In addition to
enhancing PC metastatic spreading and SC population
[124, 146], ADT, for instance, enables the proliferation of
AR-expressing fibroblasts and likely the stromal collagen
content [37]. Consequently, ADT might restrain the
growth of PC cells by building a stromal-derived niche,
while facilitating PC escape from AR inhibition. These
findings further highlight the complexity in making the
most appropriate therapeutic choice in PC treatment.

transformation (Figure 2B). However, estrogens might
control prostate transformation by inducing epigenetic
modifications in prostate SCs or progenitors. Estrogens
directly induce transformation in prostaspheres derived
from primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells
through activation of Akt and Erk. These non genomic
events might sustain cell stemness and transformation.
Simultaneously, these prostaspheres also respond to
estradiol by increasing gene transcription [153]. Although
intriguing, these results do not provide insight into the
mechanisms by which estrogen-activated cytoplasmic
or nuclear pathways impinge on cell stemness and
transformation. Nevertheless, these data might account
for some beneficial effects exerted by antiestrogens in PC
patients.
Findings obtained in prostaspheres derived from
primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells raise
another important question. Since ERα and β are both
expressed in prostaspheres, it might be argued that each
receptor isoform mediates specific cellular responses
upon estradiol binding. ERα or β might be specifically
involved in non-genomic or genomic effects elicited by
estradiol, thus contributing in a different way to hormone
action. Despite intense investigations, we still have limited
possibilities for using ligands that specifically bind ERα or
β or even synthetic ligands that specifically affect genomic
or non-genomic actions of steroids. Findings obtained
using the synthetic ligand 8β-VE2, a specific ERβ agonist,
showed that it induces apoptosis in both castrationresistant prostate CSCs [154] and a stem/progenitor
CD133+ subpopulation of the BPH-1 cell line [83]. Thus,
specific activation of ERβ by a synthetic agonist might
exert beneficial effects in CRPC, making the scenario even
more complex.

ERS IN PROSTATE SCS AND CSCS
As discussed above, the role of estrogens in the
etiology and progression of PC still remains unclear.
A model for isolating SCs from mixed epithelial cell
cultures utilizes a 3-D cell culture system, wherein only
SCs survive and proliferate, forming spheroid structures
of SCs or progenitors, also named prostaspheres. This
system, initially used to isolate neural stem cells, has
been successively extended to SCs from different tissues,
including prostate [12, 147-150]. The prostasphere
assay allows the isolation and expansion of prostate
SCs or progenitors in vitro, thereby enabling analysis
of growth and differentiation. Using this assay, it was
shown that Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation increases
the prostasphere size and self-renewal ability of PC cells
[151]. Therefore, this approach is now commonly used to
study the functions of prostate SCs.
In addition to exhibiting membrane-associated
prostate SC markers, such as CD117, Trop2, CD49f and
ABCG2, prostaspheres derived from primary cultures of
normal human prostate epithelial cells express almost
undetectable levels of AR mRNA and are AR negative
at protein level. In contrast, these cells express ERs (α
or β1 or GPR30), in combination with high levels of
retinoic acid receptor and retinoid X receptor. ER mRNA
expression levels are significantly higher in normal
progenitor cells than in LNCaP cells, with 6-fold higher
ERβ1, 15-fold higher GPR30, and 125-fold higher ERα
expression. These findings identify prostaspheres as
potential targets for estradiol and retinoids [12, 15].
Additionally, no significant differences in expression
levels of ER (α or β) were detected by qPCR in SCs from
primary normal or malignant prostate cells [152]. Table I
reports the data currently available on expression of ERs
(α or β) in prostate SCs and CSCs.
Normal prostaspheres derived from primary
cultures of human prostate epithelial cells proliferate
and grow upon stimulation with 1 nM estradiol [12].
Findings obtained using side-population FACS analysis
of primary prostate epithelial cell cultures showed a
dose-dependent increase in SC number after 4 days of
culture in 10-1000 nM estradiol [15]. Thus, estrogens
target prostate SCs or progenitors. These hormones might
enhance PC risk by increasing the number of SCs or
progenitors and expanding the number of cells undergoing

CONCLUDING REMARKS
PC represents the major cause of cancer-related
death among the male population of Western society, and
ADT is still used as the first line in PC treatment. However,
ADT frequently fails or even induces paradoxical effects.
The androgen/AR axis in PC and prostate CSCs has
been investigated for several years. Much evidence from
preclinical and clinical studies has shown that multiple
androgen/AR signaling pathways operate in prostate
tissue. Derangement of these pathways contributes to
aberrant growth, maintenance of malignancy and PC
invasiveness. At this stage, the disease becomes resistant to
castration and is almost untreatable. In recent years, many
therapeutic tools (e.g., new antagonists, enhancers of AR
degradation, small peptides interfering in AR-mediated
non-genomic events) have been designed to specifically
target the functions of epithelial or stromal AR, or even the
extra-nuclear functions of AR. Many of these molecules
have been successfully exploited in preclinical or clinical
models. Nonetheless, additional events sustain the disease

and its escape from therapy. The role of estradiol/ER axis
in PC and prostate CSCs is undeniable. Estradiol action
in PC is commonly considered AR independent, with the
focus on putative opposite effects, adverse or beneficial,
exerted by the two ER isoforms, α and β, respectively. The
novel ER, GPR30, has recently emerged as a therapeutic
target in CRPC. Since PC co-expresses classical ERs
and GPR30, a high degree of synergism and antagonism
between various ligands and antagonists likely occurs
in PC, adding further level of complexity to an already
difficult therapeutic approach.
Despite major advances in our understanding of
the molecular basis of PC and in the generation of highly
sophisticated tools for biological research, the questions
addressed here suggest that we have to profoundly reexamine the mechanism of sex steroid receptor action in
PC to better exploit new emerging targets and drugs. The
power of novel genetically-engineered animal models or
high-throughput screening in PC cells and/or biopsies
will likely improve the design of new compounds that
inhibit sex steroid receptor functions, leaving other useful
receptor activities unaltered.
