Abstract
Estrogen receptor α (ERα) plays an important role in breast cancer. Upregulation of HIF-1α in ERαpositive cancers suggests that HIF-1α may cooperate with ERα to promote breast cancer progression and
consequently affect breast cancer treatment. Here, we show the histone demethylase JMJD2B is regulated
by both ERα and HIF-1α, drives breast cancer cell proliferation in normoxia and hypoxia, and epigenetically regulates the expression of cell cycle genes such as CCND1, CCNA1, and WEE1. We also show that
JMJD2B and the hypoxia marker CA9 together stratify a subclass of breast cancer patients and predict a
worse outcome of these breast cancers. Our findings provide a biological rationale to support the therapeutic targeting of histone demethylases in breast cancer patients. Cancer Res; 70(16); 6456–66. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Estrogen plays an essential role in the establishment and
progression of breast cancer. The biological actions of estrogens are mediated by two members of the nuclear receptor
family, estrogen receptors α (ERα) and β (ERβ; refs. 1, 2).
ERα is critical to mammary epithelial cell division and breast
cancer progression, whereas ERβ suppresses transcriptional
activity of ERα (2, 3). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 is a master
regulator of oxygen homeostasis, functioning by transactivating hundreds of genes that are involved in angiogenesis, cell
survival, metabolism, and invasion or metastasis (4–6). In response to physiologic or pathologic hypoxic stress, the subunit HIF-1α is stabilized and heterodimerizes with HIF-1β,
forming a functional HIF-1 transactivator that binds the hypoxia response element (HER) to initiate gene expression. In
normoxia, the HIF-1α subunit is posttranslationally hydroxylated by a class of enzymes called prolyl hydroxylases, reAuthors' Affiliations: 1 Growth Factor Group, Cancer Research UK,

sulting in Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)–mediated proteasomal
degradation, thus maintaining the activity of HIF-1 at low
levels (7, 8). HIF-1α is upregulated in many solid tumors as
a consequence of hypoxia. Nevertheless, HIF-1α may also be
upregulated in normoxia by oncogenic stimulation, mitochondrial metabolic dysfunction, or loss of the tumor
suppressor VHL (9).
HIF-1α has been associated with an aggressive phenotype
of breast cancer, with large tumor size, high grade, high proliferation, and lymph node metastasis (10). Increased HIF-1α
expression is also associated with ERα positivity (10), and
hypoxia can trigger ligand-independent ERα activation (11),
possibly by direct HIF-1α and ERα interaction. Two studies
suggest that hypoxia and estrogen can cooperate to regulate
gene expression in T47D breast cancer cells (12) or increase
transcriptional activity of ERE (13), but whether HIF-1α is
involved in this process is unknown. Hypoxia is an important
determinant of tumor resistance to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are important
antagonists or suppressors of estrogen activity in breast cancer, and our recent clinical study has indicated that HIF-1α is
significantly associated with endocrine therapy resistance in
ERα-positive breast cancers (14).
Collectively, these observations suggest that an unidentified mechanism exists by which interaction of the HIF-1α
and ERα signaling pathways could coordinate to promote
breast cancer progression. However, the molecular mechanism of coordinated gene regulation by HIF-1α and ERα
in breast cancer has not been elucidated. In this study, we
found that HIF-1α and ERα regulate a common signaling
pathway engaged by the histone lysine demethylase JMJD2B.
JMJD2B is upregulated in hypoxia in an HIF-1α–dependent
manner. ERα is critical for JMJD2B induction in hypoxia in
ER-positive breast cancer cells. JMJD2B is functional in hypoxia and regulates histone demethylation on the promoters

Coordination of ERα and HIF-1α in regulation of JMJD2B

of its target genes, which include multiple signaling pathways
and biological processes that are involved in cancer. JMJD2B
is critical to breast cancer cell survival in normoxia and hypoxia, partly through regulation of cell cycle progression, is
highly expressed in ERα-positive primary breast cancers,
and is an adverse prognostic factor in hypoxic breast cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
Breast cancer cell lines MCF7, T47D, MDA-MB-361, MDAMB-468, and MDA-MB-231 were cultured in DMEM. All cell
culture media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum, penicillin (50 IU/mL), and streptomycin sulfate
(50 μg/mL). For hypoxia incubation, cells were exposed to
hypoxic conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2, and 94% N2) in a HetoHolten CellHouse 170 incubator (RS Biotech). 17β-Estradiol
(E2) was purchased from Calbiochem. ICI 182780 was purchased from Tocris Bioscience. 4-Hydroxy-tamoxifen and
desferrioxamine were purchased from Sigma.
Small interfering RNA Transfection
Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) were transfected into subconfluent cells using HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen)
according to the manufacturer's instructions. The target sequences for HIF-1α and HIF-2α that were synthesized by
Eurogentec (Eurogentec) were as follows: HIF-1α, 5-UCAAGUUGCUGGUCAUCAGdTdT-3; HIF-2α, 5-ACUGCUAUCAAAGAUGCUGdTdT-3. The siRNA oligos for JMJD2B were

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (EZ-CHIP).
Briefly, MCF cells were cross-linked with 1% paraformaldehyde for 10 minutes and quenched for 5 minutes with
125 mmol/L of glycine. After sonification, cell lysates were
spun down and 100 μL of supernatant was diluted to 1 mL
for immunopreciptation. Samples were precleared with 60 μL
of protein G beads. Appropriate concentrations of antibodies
were used for immunopreciptation of the cross-linked DNAprotein complexes. After a serial washing, DNA-protein

Results
Identification of an interaction between the ERα and
HIF-1α pathways
We found a functional association of HIF-1α and ERα using molecular concept (http://www.oncomine.com) analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S1A). To further understand the interaction between the HIF-1α and ERα signaling pathways, we
used Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (23) to analyze the association of genes differentially regulated by HIF-1α in MCF7
cells from a recent publication (19) with an ERα positivity
gene signature (18). Using this method, we found that ERαregulated genes such as CA12 and CCNG2 were enriched in
the HIF-1α target gene signature (Supplementary Fig. S1B
and C), suggesting an interaction between HIF-1α and
ERα. Among the genes that are regulated by both ERα and
HIF-1α (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), we focused on
JMJD2B gene in this study for several reasons. JMJD2B encodes a histone demethylase that has been recently shown
to be a HIF-1α target gene by us and others (24–27). However, the functions of the most histone demethylases including
JMJD2B are not clear (especially in hypoxia), and how histone
demethylase epigenetically regulates gene expression in hypoxia has not been well shown. Importantly, elucidation of the
function of JMJD2B may help to find novel therapeutic targets for breast cancers.
ERα-dependent regulation of JMJD2B
The histone demethylase JMJD2 family has potential oncogenic functions (28). However, the molecular mechanism
by which JMJD2s promote cancer progression is unknown.
In addition, how JMJD2 oncogenes respond to proliferative
signals (such as hormone stimulation) and antagonize environmental stress (such as hypoxia) has not been reported. To address the role of JMJD2B, we analyzed
JMJD2B expression in primary breast cancers and found
that JMJD2B is significantly expressed in ER-positive breast
cancers (Supplementary Fig. S1D). To test these observations in human breast cancer cell lines, we examined
JMJD2B expression in ER-positive (T47D and MCF7) and
ER-negative (MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468) breast cancer cells. Real-time PCR and Western blotting showed that

6458

JMJD2B was highly expressed in ER-positive cells in comparison with ER-negative cells (data not shown; Fig. 1A),
further indicating that JMJD2B expression is correlated
with ERα status.
To examine whether ERα regulates JMJD2B expression in
a ligand-dependent manner, we treated estrogen-deprived
T47D and MCF7 cells with E2 for 16 hours and assessed
the expression of JMJD2B. E2 treatment caused an increase
in JMJD2B expression at mRNA levels and protein levels in
T47D cells (Fig. 1B) and in known ERα target genes c-Myc,
CCND1, and pS2 (TFF1). Similarly, E2 treatment induced
JMJD2B expression in MCF7 cells, although to a lesser extent at the 16-hour time point (Supplementary Fig. S2A and
B). To further examine the role of ERα in the regulation of
JMJD2B expression, T47D cells were treated with the ERα
inhibitor ICI182780. This inhibitor suppressed the expression of ERα (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and c-Myc, CCND1,
and pS2 (TFF1; Fig. 1C). Importantly, ICI182780 inhibited
JMJD2B expression at both mRNA and protein levels (Supplementary Fig. S3A; Fig. 1C). Similarly, ICI182780 treatment
led to JMJD2B downregulation in MCF7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). To further confirm ERα-dependent expression of JMJD2B, siRNA was used to knockdown the
expression of ERα in T47D and MCF7 cells. Loss of ERα
in T47D and MCF7 cells resulted in a great reduction in
JMJD2B expression (Fig. 1D). To determine whether ERα directly binds to JMJD2B gene, we analyzed JMJD2B gene locus and found an ERα binding site in the first intron of
JMJD2B gene (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Our ChIP-PCR assay
revealed that ERα bound this region in vivo (Supplementary
Fig. S3C), suggestive of a functional ERα binding element.
In agreement with our findings, a genome-wide analysis
of ERα binding sites also showed an ER binding in the first
intron of JMJD2B (29). In addition, another global analysis
of ERα binding showed that JMJD2B is an ER-regulated
gene (30).
Collectively, these data indicate that JMJD2B is a bona fide
target of ERα, and its expression in ER-positive breast cancer
cells is mainly dependent on ERα.
ERα is important for JMJD2B expression in hypoxia
We and others have shown that JMJD2B can be upregulated in hypoxia in an HIF-1α–dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S4A–F; refs. 24–27), raising the question of
whether ERα is still required for JMJD2B induction in hypoxia. To address this question, we treated estrogendeprived T47D cells with E2 in normoxia and hypoxia.
E2 treatment increased JMJD2B expression in normoxia
and hypoxia (Fig. 2A). Suppression of ERα, by either treating cells with ICI182780 or RNAi, not only reduced JMJD2B
expression in normoxia but significantly downregulated
JMJD2B expression in hypoxia in ER-positive breast cancer
cells (Fig. 2B–D), indicating that ERα still functions to regulate JMJD2B expression in hypoxia. The ER depletion in
hypoxia was more effective at inhibiting JMJD2B induction
than the HIF siRNA. Of note, suppression of ERα also reduced HIF-1α expression (Fig. 2B–D), suggesting that ERα
is important for HIF-1α induction or protein stabilization.

JMJD2B regulates multiple biological processes
including the cell cycle
To analyze the functions of JMJD2B, we performed
genome-wide expression profiling to identify JMJD2B target
genes in MCF7 cells. Depletion of JMJD2B downregulated 300
genes in normoxia but only 142 genes in hypoxia, 59 of which
were commonly downregulated in normoxia and hypoxia
(Fig. 3A). Intriguingly, depletion of JMJD2B only upregulated
33 genes in normoxia, but 137 genes in hypoxia, 22 of which
were commonly upregulated (Fig. 3A). These data have several implications: (a) JMJD2B can regulate a hypoxia-specific
transcriptional response; (31) JMJD2B predominantly regulates transcriptional activation in normoxia because loss
of JMJD2B causes downregulation of gene expression,
although this transcriptional competence of JMJD2B is
compromised in hypoxia; (c) transcriptionally repressive
and active functions of JMJD2B coexist in hypoxia because
depletion of JMJD2B causes differential expression approximately in a 1:1 ratio; (d) JMJD2B maintains a basal activity
in normoxia, regulates expression of a substantial number of
genes, and preserves this ability under hypoxia stress, as
evidenced by a set of common genes such as CCNA1 and
SOCS2 that are regulated by JMJD2B in normoxia and hypoxia (Fig. 3C).

www.aacrjournals.org

Gene ontology analysis revealed that JMJD2B regulates multiple signaling pathways and biological processes (Fig. 3B).
For example, JMJD2B regulates Wnt, transforming growth
factor-β (TGF-β), Notch, vascular endothelial growth factor,
phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathways, and angiogenesis, all of
which play important roles in tumorigenesis or cancer progression. Biological processes engaged by JMJD2B target
genes include signal transduction, cell proliferation and differentiation, cell adhesion, and oncogenesis. Importantly,
JMJD2B regulates cell cycle genes such as CCND1, CCNA1,
and WEE1 (Fig. 3C), indicating that JMJD2B is important
for the regulation of breast cancer cell proliferation. CCND1
encodes cyclin D1, which complexes with cyclin-dependent
kinases CDK4/CDK6 to regulate G 1 phase progression.
CCNA1 encodes cyclin A1, which can activate CDK2 or
CDK1 and may play a role in driving cells to enter S phase
and G2-M phase transition. Wee1 is a CDK-inhibitory kinase
that phosphorylates CDK1, thereby suppressing G2-M phase
transition. In this study, we found that JMJD2B positively
regulates CCNA1 expression and negatively regulates
WEE1 expression (Fig. 3C), suggesting that JMJD2B can promote G2-M phase transition. Interestingly, JMJD2B negatively regulates CCND1 expression, suggesting that JMJD2B
might be also involved in G1 phase regulation to coordinate

cell cycle progression. PGR, which encodes progesterone receptor PR, is also positively regulated by JMJD2B (Fig. 3C).
PR has been involved in cell cycle regulation of breast cancer cells (32), and JMJD2B might also regulate breast cancer
cell proliferation through PR.
JMJD2B is important for breast cancer cell
proliferation
Uncontrolled cell proliferation is the hallmark of cancer, and
tumor cells have typically acquired alterations to genes that
directly regulate their cell cycles (33, 34). The evidence that
JMJD2B gene is amplified in medulloblastoma (35) and, herein,
that it regulates expression of cell cycle genes, indicates that
JMJD2B may play a role in oncogenesis by promoting cell
proliferation. We therefore analyzed the role of JMJD2B in cells
grown with full serum and phenol red–containing medium,
that is, in the presence of estrogen and other growth factors.
Loss of JMJD2B caused a significant decrease in cell proliferation, as assessed by counting cell numbers (Fig. 4A), by cell
viability assay (Supplementary Fig. S5A), and by colony formation assay (Fig. 4B) in the presence of estrogen. Fluorescenceactivated cell sorting analysis revealed that depletion of
JMJD2B caused a significant G2-M phase arrest in normoxia
and hypoxia (Fig. 4C and D), which is consistent with the Western blotting results that loss of JMJD2B upregulated WEE1,
Cyclin B1, and Cyclin D1 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). These data
indicate that JMJD2B drives breast cancer cell proliferation in
an estrogenic environment through direct or indirect coordination of the G2-M phase and G1 phases of the cell cycle.

Histone demethylase function of JMJD2B in hypoxia
JMJD2B is a JmjC domain containing histone lysine demethylase, which belongs to the dioxygenase family, whose
activities require iron, α-ketoglutarate, and oxygen (36). Thus,
the induction of JMJD2B by hypoxia raises an important question: Does JMJD2B exert an enzyme-independent function in
hypoxia or use limited oxygen to catalyze the reaction? To address these questions, we assessed the enzymatic activity of
JMJD2B by overexpressing HA-tagged JMJD2B in MCF7 cells.
JMJD2B is a specific H3K9me3/me2 demethylase. Therefore,
we focused on studies of H3K9 methylation. JMJD2B erased
the H3K9me3 mark in normoxia (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, this
function was similar under 1% O2 (Fig. 5A). H3K9me2 levels
were also reduced by JMJD2B, although to a much lesser extent (Fig. 5A). H3K9me1 levels were increased presumably due
to the conversion of H3K9me3/me2 to H2K9me1 (Fig. 5A).
Immunostaining and subcellular fractionation results revealed that endogenous JMJD2B was mainly localized in the
nucleus in normoxia and hypoxia in MCF7 cells (data not
shown; Fig. 5B), consistent with its role as a histone demethylase and transcriptional regulator. Nevertheless, neither induction of endogenous JMJD2B in hypoxia nor depletion of
JMJD2B caused a significant global change in H3K9me3/
me2 levels (Fig. 5C), suggesting that physiologic JMJD2B acts
locally to control specific gene expression or to maintain the
chromatin environment in specific regions.
To directly examine the histone demethylase functions
of JMJD2B, we assessed H3K9me3 levels on its target gene
promoters using ChIP-PCR (Fig. 5D). We chose the genes

including CCNA1, PGR, PMP22, CCND1, and WEE1 that
were positively or negatively regulated by JMJD2B. We
found that, after depletion of JMJD2B either in normoxia
or in hypoxia, H3K9me3 levels were significantly enriched
on those gene promoters that are positively regulated by
JMJD2B such as CCNA1, PGR, and PMP22, indicating that
JMJD2B can directly bind its target gene promoters and
erase silencing marks from these promoters, thereby activating gene transcription in response to hypoxic stress.
However, for the genes that are negatively regulated by
JMJD2B such as WEE1 and CCND1, the H3K9me3 marks
were not consistent with this pattern after JMJD2B depletion. We found that the H3K9me3 mark on CCND1
promoter in normoxia was below detection but was significantly enriched in hypoxia. Loss of JMJD2B reduced the
H3K9me3 mark on the CCND1 promoter in hypoxia, suggesting that for some genes, the increase in JMJD2 expression in hypoxia can result not only in maintenance of
activity but also increased activity. However, the effects

on the suppressed promoters in hypoxia were minimal
compared with those upregulated.
Clinical assessment of JMJD2B protein induction in
breast cancer
To further confirm the role of JMJD2B in breast cancer, we
performed immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays to
observe the in situ expression of JMJD2B protein. Because
JMJD2B is an ERα target gene, we assessed the JMJD2B expression according to the ER status. JMJD2B was significantly
associated with ERα when it was predominantly localized in
the nucleus (P < 0.001; Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 6A).
However, we also observed that JMJD2B was localized in
the cytoplasm of cancer cells in a fraction of tumors (data
not shown); cytoplasmic expression of JMJD2B was not associated with ERα status (P = 0.69; Supplementary Table S1),
suggesting that JMJD2B function might also be regulated
by an ER-dependent mechanism, which can regulate the subcellular localization of JMJD2B. To study the association of

JMJD2B and hypoxia, we used CA9 as a hypoxia marker. Nuclear JMJD2B and membranous/cytoplasmic CA9 colocalized
in serially cut whole sections (Fig. 6B). Nuclear JMJD2B was
highly expressed in perinecrotic hypoxic regions of breast
cancer, in which there was often strong membranous CA9
staining. Of the 54 CA9-positive cases, 32 were ER positive.
Of those 32 CA9-positive/ER-positive cases, 19 were positive
for JMJD2B nuclear staining.
After correcting for multiple testing, cytoplasmic JMJD2B
expression was not statistically significantly associated with
clinicopathologic variables or CA9 expression (P = 0.71;
Supplementary Table S1). Nuclear JMJD2B expression was
independent of other clinicopathologic variables such as tumor grade, nodal status, or HER2 status (Supplementary
Table S1). We analyzed whether JMJD2B alone could predict clinical outcomes. Again, cytoplasmic JMJD2B expression was not significantly associated with relapse-free or

overall survival. Nuclear JMJD2B expression was not significantly associated with relapse-free or overall survival. In multivariate analyses (including all statistically significant clinical
and pathologic variables by univariate analysis), neither cytoplasmic nor nuclear JMJD2B are significantly associated with
relapse-free (Supplementary Table S2) or overall survival
(Supplementary Table S3). The significance of JMJD2B expression in these multivariate survival analyses is not altered if
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or hormonal therapy received
is included in the models (data not shown). ERα positivity
usually predicts a better survival as we have shown here (Supplementary Table S2 and S3). However, hypoxia or HIF-1α is
usually associated with worse survival and resistance to therapy. As JMJD2B expression may be regulated by both ERα and
HIF-1α, we combined JMJD2B expression and CA9 expression
as a prognosis prediction marker. We found that those patients who are JMJD2B positive and CA9 positive showed a

Coordination of ERα and HIF-1α in regulation of JMJD2B

significantly worse outcome in overall survival than CA9positive JMJD2B-negative groups (P = 0.026; Fig. 6C), and a
worse tendency in relapse-free survival (P = 0.12; Fig. 6D),
suggesting that JMJD2B plays an important role in breast
cancer progression mediated by both ERα and HIF-1α. CA9
was chosen as a marker of HIF-1α function because of its
much greater stability and extensive validation in prognosis.

Discussion
Aberrant histone methylation has been linked to cancer
(36). A recent study has shown that members of the JMJD2
family of histone demethylases have an oncogenic function
and are highly expressed in human cancers (15). The involvement of the JMJD2 proteins in tumorigenesis has been

supported further by recent studies indicating that JMJD2C
works as an essential coactivator of androgen receptor–
induced transcription and cellular growth through a functional interaction between JMJD2C and the androgen receptor in
prostate carcinomas (35, 37). JMJD2B and JMJD2C are also
amplified in medulloblastomas. Nevertheless, how JMJD2 is
regulated by upstream oncogenic signals and the nature of
its downstream effectors has not been elucidated (15, 24, 25).
In this study, we have shown that JMJD2B is highly expressed in ER-positive primary breast cancers and breast
cancer cell lines whose expression can be driven by E2 treatment. The correlation of JMJD2B gene expression with ERα
in primary breast cancers and the dependence on ERα/E2 for
enhanced expression of JMJD2B in breast cancer cells and
ChIP analysis show that JMJD2B is a bona fide target of ERα.
Hypoxia can cause chromatin alterations such as histone
methylation (38). Although JMJD2B requires oxygen for its
enzymatic activity as a dioxygenase, 1% O2 does not affect

its enzymatic function in our model systems. Overexpression
of JMJD2B in hypoxia erases global H3K9me3 marks, and loss
of JMJD2B results in an increase in H3K9me3 levels on its
local target gene promoters such as CCNA1 and PGR in hypoxia, suggesting that JMJD2B is able to function under relatively low oxygen levels. Nevertheless, regulation of JMJD2B
by HIF-1 does not affect the importance of ERα in hypoxia
in ER-positive breast cancer cells, as loss of ERα significantly
attenuated (or nearly abolished) JMJD2B expression in hypoxia, suggesting that HIF-1 and ER synergistically regulate
JMJD2B in hypoxia.
Epigenetic suppression of gene transcription is potentially
an important mechanism for cell survival under hypoxic conditions. Indeed, the number of genes suppressed by JMJD2B
increases from 33 in normoxia to 137 in hypoxia, although we
do not understand how exactly JMJD2B initiates this program. Nevertheless, the activities of essential genes to ensure
cell proliferation and survival should be maintained under

Coordination of ERα and HIF-1α in regulation of JMJD2B

either normal conditions or hypoxia, although extreme stress
could significantly suppress cell proliferation or cause cell
death. In addition to regulating important signaling pathways such as Wnt, Notch, TGF-β, and angiogenesis, JMJD2B
coordinately regulates cell cycle gene expression by upregulating CCNA1 expression and suppressing CCND1 and WEE1
expression in normoxia and hypoxia. Therefore, JMJD2B
seems to positively promote G2-M phase transition but negatively regulates the G1 phase. Because posttranslational
modifications such as proteasomal degradation play a critical role in regulating cell cycle, our findings that JMJD2B epigenetically regulates cyclin expression in breast cancer cells
provide a new insight for understanding the functions of
JMJD2 family members. However, this work does not provide
direct evidence these genes are immediately downstream of
JMJD2B, which will need individual analysis of promoters.
Given that JMJD2B is highly expressed in ERα-positive
breast cancers and is essential for breast cancer cell proliferation/survival under estrogen stimulation conditions, by
directly or indirectly promoting cell cycle progression, targeting JMJD2B may be an alternative strategy to block the
ERα signaling pathway. Importantly, tamoxifen-resistant
ERα is still functional in driving JMJD2B expression in normoxia and hypoxia for breast cancer cell proliferation (data
not shown). The availability of a crystal structure of the
JmjC domain of JMJD2A (39), which exhibits high homology
to that of JMJD2B, may accelerate the identification of
small-molecule inhibitors for this class of enzymes. Although

JMJD2B is an ERα target gene, it is also highly expressed
in other cancers such as prostate cancer and bladder cancer
(data not shown).
By using JMJD2B and CA9 in combination, we have successfully stratified a subclass of breast cancers that show a
worse outcome in overall survival. This suggests that the
evaluation of JMJD2B and CA9 may be of value in patient
selection if such therapies are developed.
