BACKGROUND: Despite the rise in publicly available cancer information, little is known about the association between patient information seeking and the adoption of cancer technologies. The authors of this
report investigated the relation between patient information seeking and awareness about and receipt of
novel targeted therapy (TT) for colon cancer among patients for whom therapy is approved by the
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and among patients for whom therapy is not FDA approved.
METHODS: A retrospective, population-based survey of 633 colon cancer patients were identified through
the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry. Outcome measures were self-reported awareness about and receipt of
TT (bevacizumab and cetuximab). RESULTS: After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, high levels of treatment information seeking were associated strongly with hearing about TT (odds ratio [OR],
2.83; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.49-5.38) and receiving TT (OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.36-7.62). These associations were present for patients with metastatic disease, for whom the use of TT is FDA approved, and for
patients with localized disease, for whom the use of TT is not FDA approved (P for interactions ¼ .29).
Internet use (OR, 2.88; 95% CI, 1.40-5.94) and newspaper/magazine use (OR, 3.44; 95% CI, 1.34-8.84) were
associated with hearing about TT. Seeking information from nontreating physicians was associated with
hearing about TT (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.03-3.68) and receiving TT (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.16-5.97). CONCLUSIONS: Patient information seeking was related to the adoption of TT for colon cancer in both appropriate
and inappropriate clinical settings. These findings emphasize the importance of exploring patient influence
on physician prescribing patterns and understanding the impact of information seeking on cancer outC 2009 American Cancer Society.

Information Seeking in Colon Cancer/Gray et al

In the last 40 years, patients have become more involved
in their healthcare as the physician-patient relationship
has shifted from a largely paternalistic model to 1 that
emphasizes patient autonomy.1-5 At the same time, there
has been unprecedented growth in the amount of health
information that is available to patients. Widespread
access to communication technologies, such as the Internet, has made health information almost ubiquitous.6,7
This increased access is reflected in widespread health information seeking by lay individuals. For example,
approximately 45% of individuals report looking for
cancer information, and approximately 39% of cancer
patients seek cancer information on the Internet.6,8
If patients’ use of health information is increasing,
then it remains unclear how these phenomena will influence medical outcomes. Patient access to information
may erode components of the physician-patient relationship; however, increased access may lead to more
informed patients and improved shared decision making.9-12 In addition, patient information seeking may
produce adverse effects, such as an increased demand
for cancer-related therapies and technologies. Increased
patient access to medical information also may directly
influence population health by influencing health behaviors and reducing disparities in information access.6,7,13
Theories suggest that access to health information
may have an impact on the diffusion and adoption of new
medical technologies. Diffusion of innovation is a complex process that is influenced by factors as diverse as
pricing, government regulation, patient, physician, and
technology characteristics, and physician interpersonal
networks.14-21 Patterns of adoption of new technologies
also are influenced strongly by exposure to information.15,22 Physicians commonly encounter information in
a professional context, but there is evidence that media
coverage influences physician attitudes about scientific
discoveries or amplifies the impact of publications in the
research community.23,24 Patients may learn about novel
therapies from sources such as the media and the Internet.
This phenomenon may be particularly important for cancer treatment when new therapies are developed rapidly
and receive considerable media attention.
Although several studies have demonstrated that
individuals who look for health information have
improved knowledge, engage in more cancer-prevention
behaviors, and take more active roles in decision making,
Cancer

little published work exists that examines the relation
between cancer information seeking and cancer treatment.25-27 In 1 study, 47% of patients who were referred
for participation in a prominent phase 1 drug trial first
learned about the trial from media sources, and 51% of
those patients subsequently contacted their physician for
more information.28
Here, we report the results of a study examining the
relation between cancer patient information seeking and
awareness about and use of novel targeted therapy for colon
cancer. We focused on treatments with targeted therapy,
bevacizumab (Avastin) and cetuximab (Erbitux), because
of their clinical importance, significant media coverage,
and recent US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval. We investigated awareness and use of targeted therapy in both on-label and off-label indications, because we
believed that there might be both positive and negative
associations of information seeking on drug use. We
hypothesized that there would be a relation between information seeking and awareness of targeted therapies for all
patients with colon cancer, because information on bevacizumab and cetuximab is widely available and likely would
be encountered during treatment information seeking,
regardless of whether targeted therapy would be indicated.
In addition, because treatment information seeking may
lead patients to inquire about specific medications and,
subsequently, to receive those medications, we hypothesized that information seeking would be associated with the
use of targeted therapy with a greater effect in patients for
whom targeted therapy is approved by the FDA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
We conducted a retrospective, population-based survey of
633 colorectal cancer patients to identify the association
between cancer information seeking and awareness about
and receipt of targeted therapy for colon cancer. All
patients provided informed consent before participating,
and we obtained institutional board approval from the
University of Pennsylvania.
Patients
We surveyed a randomly chosen sample of colon cancer
patients from a list obtained from the Pennsylvania
1425

Original Article

Cancer Registry. Patients were eligible if they were diagnosed with colorectal cancer between January 2005 and
December 2005 in Pennsylvania. To have the statistical
power to estimate large differences in cancer information
seeking by racial and stage groups, we set recruiting objectives for stage and racial subgroups before data collection.
We evaluated response rates after the first wave of data collection and subsequently over-sampled patients with stage
IV cancer and African-American patients, because we
observed that these groups had lower response rates than
other subgroups. Patients were excluded from the study if
they were unable to provide informed consent.
Data Collection
We mailed surveys to 1581 potential patients in 2006,
1305 in the initial sample and 276 in the over-sample.
The mailing procedures were based on the Dillman
method for mail surveys.29 The American Association for
Public Opinion Research response rate was 60% for the
initial sample and 32% for the over-sample.30 Of the 682
respondents in the total sample, 633 had complete stage
data and were included in our analyses.

possible. The survey was pilot tested with 29 cancer
patients. After the pilot, the questionnaire was revised and
retested with a small number of respondents. No pilot
data were included in the analysis.

Measures
Sociodemographic and health characteristics

We obtained self-reported information about age,
race/ethnicity, education, marital status, and health status
through survey questions. We obtained information
about cancer type, sex, and cancer stage from the Pennsylvania Cancer Registry database. We generated an American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union
Against Cancer TNM stage for each patient by combining
Pennsylvania Cancer Registry data on tumor characteristics, lymph node involvement, and metastasis. On the
basis of the FDA-approved indications for bevacizumab
and cetuximab use in 2005, patients were included in the
1426

on-label group if they had metastatic disease. All other
patients were included in the off-label group.
Measures

The cancer information-seeking measure and our 2
outcome measures are displayed in Table 1. We used the
cancer information-seeking measure to create an index of
information-seeking breadth based on number of sources
that patients used to look for treatment information. Earlier work by our group indicated that cancer patients
actively seek information from all listed sources, including
television and radio (ie, patients deliberately watch shows

Information Seeking in Colon Cancer/Gray et al

that they know will discuss cancer). The index ranged
from 0 (no seeking) to 11 (seeking from 11 source categories) and did not include seeking information from the
treating physician. Patients were categorized into 3
groups: nonseekers (0 sources used), low seekers (1-2
source categories used), and high seekers (3 source categories used). Awareness about and receipt of targeted therapy were measured with 2 questions. Patients were
categorized as aware of targeted therapy if they reported
having heard of ‘‘Avastin or Erbitux.’’. Patients were categorized as having received targeted therapy if they
reported receiving ‘‘Avastin or Erbitux’’. Targeted therapy
options for colon cancer in 2005 included cetuximab and
bevacizumab. On the basis of pilot-test feedback, we used
the trade names rather than the generic names in the survey to minimize patient confusion.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary focus was on whether information seeking
was related to awareness of and use of targeted therapy for
those who did and did not have an FDA indication. We
used logistic regression to examine the unadjusted associations between patient characteristics, FDA indication
group, and information seeking with hearing about or
receiving targeted therapy. We then used multiple logistic
regression to adjust the associations between seeking and
hearing about or receiving targeted therapy for potential
confounding variables. All hypothesis tests were 2-tailed
and used a significance level of P ¼ .05. Missing data
comprised <15% of all data and were excluded from the
analysis. We used poststratification weights, which
adjusted the distribution of respondents to match the
colon cancer population from the Pennsylvania Cancer
Registry on marital status, race, cancer stage, age, and sex,
to account for the over-sample and for nonresponse. All
statistical analysis was conducted in STATA version 10
(Stata Corp. College Station, Tex).

ment information seeking, and hearing about or receiving
targeted therapy in Table 4. After adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics, health status, and FDA indication, high levels of treatment information seeking were
associated strongly with both hearing about (odds ratio
[OR], 2.83; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.495.38) and receiving (OR, 3.22; 95% CI, 1.36-7.62) targeted therapy for cancer (Table 5).
We then conducted a series of analyses to determine
whether the associations between information seeking and
outcome differed between patients in the on-label and offlabel groups. There was no significant interaction between
information seeking and FDA indication (P ¼ .29). However, the subgroup results are shown in Table 6 to illustrate the strength of association in each group.
In addition, we investigated whether or not information seeking was associated significantly with awareness of
targeted therapy in the subgroup of patients who did not
receive targeted therapy. The association between information seeking and awareness of targeted therapy trended
toward significance among patients who did not receive
targeted therapy (OR, 2.19; 95% CI, 0.85-5.65; P ¼ .10;
analysis not shown).

When examining the associations between specific
source use and outcomes (Table 7), we observed that those
who sought information from the Internet and newspapers/magazines had higher odds of hearing about targeted
therapy than nonseekers. Patients who reported seeking
treatment information from other physicians or health
professionals had significantly higher odds of both hearing
about and receiving targeted therapy than nonseekers
from those sources.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the relation between cancer information seeking and treatmentrelated behaviors in a large, population-based sample.
Our findings suggest that cancer patient treatment information seeking is common and that it is associated with
both awareness about and receipt of novel targeted thera1430

pies for colon cancer. These results have several implications for clinical practice and future research in this area.
One compelling finding is that high levels of information seeking were associated with both hearing about
and receiving targeted therapy even after controlling for
potential confounders. The primary question that this
finding raises is whether information seeking leads to
more treatment or whether receiving treatment leads to
information seeking. We tried to decrease recall bias by
asking patients to report seeking behavior that they
engaged in while making treatment decisions. In addition,
we have some evidence that the association between seeking and awareness about targeted therapy may be present
even in patients who did not receive targeted therapy,
although this association was not statistically significant.
However, it is also possible that information seekers are
more likely to recall the names of the specific therapies
that they have received and, thus, may be more likely to
recall receiving targeted therapy than low seekers or

noninformation seekers. Although causal order is difficult
to determine in a cross-sectional study, there is a body of
literature demonstrating that, when patients request specific medications, they are more likely to obtain prescriptions for those medications.31-33 Patient inquiry may be
particularly influential in the case of targeted therapies, in
which there is considerable variation in physician experience. Physicians who have limited experience with new
drugs may not automatically prescribe them but could be
persuaded to do so at a patient’s request.
Our data supported our hypothesis that that there
would be a relation between information seeking and
awareness of targeted therapy in all colon cancer patients.
We also observed evidence that the association between
treatment information seeking and the use of targeted
therapy is present both in patients for whom therapy
would be FDA approved and in patients for whom therapy would not be approved. Previous work has indicated
that off-label drug use is common in many fields of medicine, including oncology.34-36 Kocs et al evaluated the
use of rituximab (a targeted therapy for non-Hodgkin
lymphoma) between 1998 and 2001 and observed that it
was administered 75% of the time for off-label indications, and off-label use was not associated with clinical
trials. 36 Bevacizumab and cetuximab are considered part
of the standard of care for palliative treatment of
advanced colon cancer; however, current data do not
support the routine use of these drugs in the adjuvant
setting.37-40 Adjuvant use of targeted therapy is an area
of active research, but some experts fear that oncologists
may inappropriately consider using adjuvant targeted
therapy in selected patients.40 Although off-label drug
use is legal, it often is done in the absence of good supporting data.34,41 Kocs et al suggest that the diffusion of
information may be a key factor in off-label use and that
media exposure and direct to consumer advertising
(DTCA) may alter the demand for new technologies.
Specifically, they suggest that DTCA may lead to a relative expansion in the use of interventions for off-label
indications, because of a possible ‘spillover’ effect from
approved indications.36
If patient information seeking is related to treatment
choices, then there are several implications worth considering. First, if patients are influencing the diffusion and
adoption of medical technologies, then it is important to
consider how direct patient demand may influence the

quality of care patients receive and the cost of care at a
population level. If patient information seeking increases
access to targeted therapy in indicated situations, then
there may be an overall improvement in the quality of
care. However, if patient information seeking leads to an
increase in inappropriate access, then we may find overall
reductions in the quality of care or, worse still, an increase
in patient harm. Significant concerns already have been
raised about the possible relations between heavy marketing, inappropriate drug use, and patient harm in
the setting of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.42,43 In addition cetuximab and
bevacizumab are extremely expensive. Bevacizumab has a
projected societal cost of $1.5 billion per year when used
for metastatic colon cancer; and, as a society, we have not
yet determined how to deal with these costs.44 If patient
demand for targeted therapy influences use, then it too
may need to be addressed as we work to strike a balance
between access to innovation and cost control.
Our results also suggest that different sources of information may play different roles in the dissemination of
information related to targeted therapy for cancer. Two
source categories, the Internet and newspapers/magazines,
were associated with awareness but not with the receipt of
targeted therapy. Although our study may be underpowered to find differences for specific sources, these data provide some evidence that disparate use of information
technology, the ‘‘digital divide,’’ may not necessarily have
an impact on the therapies that patients receive.45,46
However, other studies have demonstrated that health information seeking is less common in men, Hispanics, and
individuals who are less educated, older, and of lower
socioeconomic status.25,26,47-49 More work is needed
to determine whether or not information seeking relates
to or exacerbates cancer disparities.
In addition, our analysis suggests that information
from other physicians (as distinguished from the patient’s
treating physician) is associated with both hearing about
and receiving targeted therapy for colon cancer. Bevacizumab and cetuximab were approved in 2004, and patients
who needed targeted therapy in 2005 may have had to get
it from a specialized oncologist who had novel drug experience. Work by Mellink et al has indicated that patients
who seek a second opinion are motivated by a high need
for information about their disease, possible treatments,
and prognosis.50 ‘‘Second opinions’’ are important in

oncology, reportedly have produced discrepant conclusions from the original consultation in 16% to 32% of
patients, and have produced significant changes in prognostic or clinical management in 2% to 5% of
patients.51,52 Information seeking in the form of ‘‘second
opinions’’ should be evaluated further as a possible factor
in the early adoption of medical technologies.
Our study has several limitations. The first limitation, as noted above, is that it is a retrospective, cross-sectional study; therefore, causal order is ambiguous. Only a
prospective study that links cancer patients’ information
seeking and therapies received will be able to determine
whether information seeking leads to the increased use of
targeted therapy. The second limitation is that our seeking
index does not adequately allow us to determine the intensity of seeking from any specific source. For example, a
patient who sought heavily from the Internet but not
from other sources would rate lower on our seeking scale
than someone who sought a little from 2 or 3 sources. The
current scale may underestimate the actual amount of
information that patients sought. The third limitation
is that we are relying on self-reported treatment data.
Although there is a paucity of data on self-reported treatment data in cancer, other authors have observed that selfreported treatment data have moderate-to-excellent validity in other chronic diseases.53-55 Another limitation is
that, although this is a large, population-based sample, all
of our participants were diagnosed in Pennsylvania; therefore, these results may not generalize to other populations.
Finally, although our measures of treatment information
seeking were generated after a careful literature review,
expert consultation, and pilot testing with cancer patients,
they have not been validated by other groups.
Despite these limitations, the current results provide
strong evidence that most cancer patients are trying to
engage with treatment information and that high levels of
information seeking may be associated with both appropriate and inappropriate treatment. Given the enormous
cost and potential benefit of novel targeted therapies in
cancer, future research should be directed toward understanding how and whether variations in patient information seeking contribute to cancer outcomes.
