ABSTRACT
We herein report that sulforaphane (SFN), a potent anti-cancer and well-tolerated
dietary compound, inhibits cancer stem-like cell (CSC) properties and enhances
therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SFN
exerted these functions through upregulation of miR-214, which in turn targets the
coding region of c-MYC. This finding was further corroborated by our observations
that plasmid or lentiviral vector-mediated expression of 3'UTR-less c-MYC cDNA and
cisplatin- or doxorubicin-induced endogenous c-MYC accumulation was similarly
suppressed by either SFN or miR-214. Further, we showed that the reported inhibitory
effects of SFN on β-catenin are also mediated by miR-214. SFN/miR-214 signaling
inhibited CSC properties and enhanced the cytotoxicity of chemotherapeutic drugs
in vitro. Experiments with nude mice carrying xenograft tumors showed that SFN
sensitized NSCLC cells to cisplatin's efficacy, which is accompanied by inhibition of
cisplatin-induced c-MYC accumulation in tumor tissues. Our results provided strong
evidence and mechanisms to support consideration of SFN or synthetic derivatives as
a therapeutic agent in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients with
NSCLC and, potentially, other types of c-MYC-addicted tumors.

Proto-oncogene c-Myc, encoding one of the most
important transcription factors, plays a pivotal role in
tumor initiation and progression [6, 7]. c-Myc regulates
hundreds of disparate target genes that participate
numerous biological effects, such as cell proliferation,
apoptosis, differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal
[8–10]. c-Myc is one of the four factors used in
reprogramming somatic cells to induce pluripotent stem
(iPS) cells [11] and is implicated in maintaining CSCs [12,
13]. Recently, a high-resolution analysis of somatic copynumber alterations (SCNAs) from 3131 cancer specimens
revealed that amplification of the human c-MYC gene
occurs in most types of malignancies, underscoring the
critical role of c-MYC in tumor pathogenesis [14].
Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents
approximately 80% of all lung cancers and is the leading
cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide [15, 16].
Although the initial chemotherapy is successful, intrinsic
or acquired drug resistance leads to poor prognosis and

INTRODUCTION
Sulforaphane (SFN) is a natural isothiocyanate
found in broccoli and other cruciferous vegetables and is
one of the most effective chemopreventive agents against
cancer [1]. The molecular targets and mechanisms of
action of SFN have been extensively studied during the
past two decades. Early research suggested that SFN
affects tumorigenesis and tumor development through
blocking the initiation stage of cancer by inhibiting
the phase 1 metabolism enzymes and inducing phase 2
metabolism enzymes [2]. Subsequent studies disclosed
that SFN can modulate diverse cellular activities, such
as inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, and
suppressing angiogenesis and metastasis [2, 3]. Recently,
SFN was demonstrated to target cancer stem-like cells
(CSCs), also called tumor-initiating cells, by suppressing
NF-kappaB-induced antiapoptosis [4] or breast CSCs by
downregulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway [5].

disease relapse. Upregulation of c-MYC expression is
frequently detected in NSCLC and is correlated with
aggressive clinicopathological features and reduced
disease-free survival [17–19]. In the present study, we
show that SFN potently inhibited c-MYC expression
through upregulating miR-214. We further investigated the
functional impact of SFN/miR-214/c-MYC signaling on
CSC properties and chemoresistance. Our results support
further evaluation of SFN or pharmaceutical derivatives as
a therapeutic agent for the treatment of NSCLC.

The potent anti-cancer and anti-CSC activity of
SFN observed in above experiments prompted us to ask
whether these effects of SFN are associated with inhibition
of any CSC-related factors in NSCLC cells. To test this,
H460, H1299, and A549 cells were treated with 10 μmol/L
SFN followed by Western blot analyses. We found that
c-MYC protein was moderately expressed in untreated
cells and substantially down-regulated by SFN in each of
the cell lines (Figure 1A).

Identification of SFN-modulated miRNAs
in NSCLC

RESULTS

We sought to elucidate the mechanism by which
SFN regulates c-MYC expression. Since miRNAs are
master regulators of various biological processes, we
asked that whether SFN might regulate c-MYC expression
via miRNA. For this purpose, H460 cells were treated
with vehicle or SFN followed by TaqMan real-time PCR
microRNA assays. Comparison of the miRNA expression
profiles between the control and SFN treated samples
revealed a number of miRNA including miR-214, miR145, miR-199a, and miR-199b that were significantly
upregulated in SFN-treated H460 cells and were
reported to be involved in tumorigenesis and progression
(Supplementary Figure 3A & 3B).
To identify which one of the four miRNAs might
mediate SFN's effect on depletion of c-MYC production,
we searched miRNA binding sites by using readily
available bioinformatics tools. Analyses with TargetScan,
miRBase and PicTar did not predict any binding site
of these miRNAs in the 3'UTR of c-MYC mRNA.
Since recent studies have reported that miRNAs also
bind to the 5'UTR and the coding sequence (CDS) of
mammalian transcripts [24], we extended our search to
the entire c-MYC mRNA sequence. Based on RNA22 and
RNAhybrid algorithms, two potential miR-214 binding
sites were identified at nucleotide1405 and 1683 of the
c-MYC CDS (Figure 1B).

SFN inhibits cell viability, induces apoptosis,
and represses cancer stem-like cell properties of
NSCLC
We firstly evaluated effects of SFN on cell viability
in a normal lung bronchial epithelium cell line BEAS2B and three human NSCLC cell lines, H460, H1299
and A549. Compared to untreated cells, treatment with
SFN markedly inhibited NSCLC cell viability, with
an IC50 of 12, 8, and 10 μmol/L for H460, H1299 and
A549, respectively. In contrast, BEAS-2B cells were
significantly less sensitive to SFN treatment with an IC50
of 25.9 μmol/L (Supplementary Figure 1A). The effect of
SFN on DNA synthesis was measured with a 5-ethynyl2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay. SFN at 10
μmol/L decreased the percentage of EdU-positive cells in
the three NSCLC lines, implying reduction of cells in S
phase (Supplementary Figure 1B). The ability of SFN to
induce apoptosis was assessed by using flow cytometric
analysis with propidium iodide and Annexin V double
staining. SFN significantly induced apoptosis in each of
the three lines (Supplementary Figure 1C). These results
are consistent with previous reports that SFN inhibited
proliferation and induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells
[20, 21].
Tumor spheroids propagated in defined condition
were enriched for cells with cancer stem cell-like
characteristics and recapitulate the phenotype and
genotype of primary tumors [22]. Cells were cultured
in serum-free medium containing bFGF and EGF plus
SFN (5 μmol/L). Compared with vehicle treated cells,
SFN significantly reduced the number of spheroids by
85%, 78%, and 79% for H460, H1299, and A549 cells,
respectively (Supplementary Figure 2A).
Previous studies have shown that CD133+ cells
exhibit self-renewal and tumor-initiating abilities in
NSCLC [23]. We examined if SFN could suppress
CD133+ population in H460 cells that have a higher
CD133+ fraction (2~3%) than the other two cell lines.
Flow cytometric analysis with a CD133 antibody revealed
that SFN at 5 or 10 μmol/L markedly decreased the
proportion of CD133+ cells by 43% and 87%, respectively
(Supplementary Figure 2B).

c-MYC is an authentic target of miR-214
We next performed luciferase reporter assays to
determine whether miR-214 could inhibit activity of
the luciferase reporter gene by binding to the predicted
target sites. For this purpose, a luciferase reporter vector
psiCHECK2 containing the full length c-MYC CDS was
constructed (named psi-c-MYC-CDS) and co-transfected
into 293T cells together with a negative control (NC)
irrelevant miRNA-mimic, miR-214-mimic, or miR214 inhibitor. Compared with control group, miR-214
mimic markedly suppressed the luciferase activity of
psi-c-MYC-CDS whereas miR-214 inhibitor upregulated
its activity. Similar results were also observed when
the luciferase reporter assay was carried out in H460
cells (Figure 1C). To confirm that miR-214 directly

interacts with these two binding sites, double-stranded
oligonucleotides of approximate 60bp containing the
wild-type or mutated binding sites were synthesized,
inserted into the psiCHECK2 vector, and named psi1405WT, psi-1405Mut, psi-1683WT and psi-1683Mut,
respectively. These luciferase reporters were then
individually co-transfected into 293T cells with miR214 inhibitor followed by luciferase assays. Compared
with the NC-mimic, miR-214 mimic reduced luciferase
activity by 26% with psi-1405WT and by 51% with psi1683WT whereas no alteration was observed with vector
harboring either mutant binding site (Figure 1D). These
results indicate that miR-214 directly binds to the two
predicted target sites. Effects of miR-214 on regulation
of endogenous c-MYC protein were examined in H460
cells transfected with miR-214 mimic or inhibitor. Western

blot analyses showed that c-MYC protein was reduced by
miR-214 mimic and elevated by miR-214 inhibitor (Figure
1E). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that
c-MYC is a direct target of miR-214.

SFN negatively regulates the expression of
c-MYC through miR-214
Since miR-214 targets c-MYC potentially at its CDS
instead of its 3'UTR, we examined if miR-214 represses
exogenously expressed 3'UTR-less c-MYC. To this end,
c-MYC was overexpressed in NIH3T3 and H460 cells by
using a lentiviral vector lv-ef1a-c-MYC containing cDNA
of the c-MYC CDS, but devoid of its 3'UTR. Because
this vector produces abundant c-MYC protein that should
constitute most majority of total c-MYC in the cells. If

48 hours after transfection. miR-214 mimic markedly suppressed luciferase activity and miR-214 inhibitor elevated luciferase activity.

miR-214 targets c-MYC at its CDS, we expect to see an
obvious decrease in the c-MYC level after co-transfection
with lv-ef1a-c-MYC and miR-214 mimic. Western blot
analysis showed that compared with NC-mimic, miR-214
mimic substantially repressed c-MYC protein levels in
both NIH 3T3 and H460 cells (Figure 2A).
To further validate that c-MYC is an authentic target
of miR-214, we subcloned the full length c-MYC coding
region cDNA, again devoid of its 3'UTR, and a Flag
epitope tag sequence into the pEGFP-C1 vector to create
pEGFP-c-MYC-Flag that encodes an EGFP-c-MYC-Flag
fusion protein (Figure 2B). Western blot analyses of 293T
cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid revealed
a protein band of approximate 87kDa, the expected
size of the fusion protein consisting of EGFP (29 kDa),
c-MYC (57kDa) and Flag (1 kDa) (Figure 2C), suggesting
that the genetic fusion of the EGFP-c-MYC-Flag was
appropriately transcribed and translated. Examination

of EGFP green fluorescence and DAPI staining of the
transfected cells with a confocal microscope showed
nuclear localization of the fusion protein in the cells
(Figure 2D). Next, we evaluated whether inhibition of
miR-214 could rescue the SFN-induced repression of the
c-MYC fusion protein. 293T cells were co-transfected
with pEGFP-c-MYC-Flag plus NC-mimic, miR-214
mimic, or treated with SFN in the absence of presence of
miR-214 inhibitor. After 48 hours, Western blot analyses
were carried out. We found that either SFN or miR214 repressed expression of the fusion protein detected
by antibody against either Flag or c-MYC. Importantly,
inhibition of miR-214 partially rescued the suppressive
effects induced by SFN (Figure 2E). On the other hand,
when pEGFP-c-MYC-Flag was replaced with pEGFPc-MYC-FlagMut that harbors mutant miR-214 binding
sites, neither SFN nor miR-214 affected expression of
the fusion protein (Figure 2F). Similar effects of SFN and

pEGFP-c-MYC-Flag vector followed by microscopic examination of GFP green fluorescence and DAPI staining of the transfected cells.
Images showed nuclear localization of the fusion protein in the cells. E. Either SFN or miR-214 downregulated expression of the EGFP-cMYC-Flag fusion protein whereas inhibition of miR-214 partially rescued the suppressive effect of SFN as detected by Western blot
analyses with either Flag or c-MYC antibody. F. Inhibitory effects of either SFN or miR-214 on the fusion protein were abolished when
pEGFP-c-MYC-Flag was replaced with pEGFP-c-MYC-FlagMut, which harbors the mutations of miR-214 binding sites.

Figure 2 (Continued): G. Fluorescence microscopic examination of EGFP expression showed that SFN or miR-214 repressed the fusion

protein and the inhibitory effect of SFN was partially rescued by inhibiting miR-214. H. SFN and miR-214 did not affect the expression of
EGFP encoded by pEGFP-c-MYC-FlagMut.

miR-214 on the EGFP-c-MYC-Flag fusion protein were
also revealed by fluorescence microscopic examination of
EGFP expression (Figure 2G & 2H).
We next examined whether inhibition of miR-214
could rescue SFN-induced downregulation of endogenous
c-MYC protein. H460 cells were treated with SFN, miR214 inhibitor, or both for 48 hours. Compared with the
control group, the levels of c-MYC were increased by
miR-214 inhibitor and reduced following SFN treatment.
Intriguingly, the effect of SFN on repressing c-MYC
was severely compromised in the presence of miR214 inhibitor (Figure 3A). As expected, expression of

Cyclin E1, a downstream target of c-MYC, was also
downregulated by sulforaphane and partially rescued by
miR-214 inhibitor (Figure 3A). This is in accord with
our earlier EdU assay results showing S phase reduction
induced by SFN (Supplementary Figure 1B). We further
validated the authenticity of the SFN/miR-214/c-MYC
pathway by performing luciferase reporter assays. The
results showed that luciferase activity of psi-c-MYC-CDS
was reduced by SFN and this effect is attenuated by miR214 inhibitor (Figure 3B, left panel). Taken together, these
results strongly suggested that SFN represses c-MYC
expression through upregulating miR-214.

SFN/miR-214 signaling downregulates multiple
oncoproteins

this effect was partially blocked by co-treatment with miR214 inhibitor. The oncogene Survivin is another target of
miR-214 [27]. Similarly, we showed that Survivin was
downregulated by SFN/miR-214 signaling. In contrast,
expression of the tumor suppressor PTEN and p53 were
not obviously affected (Figure 3A & Supplementary
Figure 5).

β-catenin was reported to mediate SFN's
inhibitory effect on breast cancer cells and CSCs, but
the mechanisms by which SFN represses β-catenin is not
elucidated [5]. Interestingly, a recent study found that the
β-catenin gene CTNNB1 is a direct target of miR-214 in
human hepatocellular carcinoma [25]. Based on these
observations, we presume that regulation of β-catenin
by SFN is also mediated by miR-214 in NSCLC cells.
To test this, luciferase reporter assay was performed
to determine whether miR-214 could directly target the
3'UTR of CTNNB1. The results showed that luciferase
activity of psiCHECK2 vector containing the target
sequence of CTNNB1-3'UTR (psi-CTNNB1-3'UTRWT)
was significantly decreased by miR-214 mimic and
increased by miR-214 inhibitor. However, the activity of
the reporter containing mutated target site (psi-CTNNB13'UTRMut) was not affected (Supplementary Figure 4A
& 4B). Similar to c-MYC, β-catenin was reduced by miR214 mimic and elevated by miR-214 inhibitor (Figure 1E).
Further, SFN markedly repressed β-catenin protein level
(Figure 3A) and activity of the luciferase reporter psiCTNNB1-3'UTRWT (Figure 3B, right panel). Strikingly,
these inhibitory effects of SFN were totally blocked in the
presence of miR-214 inhibitor, indicating that miR-214
mediates the repressing effect of SFN on β-catenin.
It has been reported that the enhancer of zeste
homologue 2 gene (Ezh2) was targeted by miR-214 in
mouse skeletal muscle and embryonic stem cells [26] and
in human hepatocellular carcinoma [25]. We found that
EZH2 was upregulated following mir-214 inhibition in
H460 cells, in agreement with previous reports. We further
showed that EZH2 level was downregulated by SFN and

SFN/miR-214/c-MYC pathway regulates CSCs
in NSCLC
In view of the fact that c-MYC is a crucial regulator
of CSCs [13] and SFN possesses the capability in
suppressing CSCs in pancreatic [4] and breast [5] cancers,
we investigated functional impact of the SFN/miR-214/cMYC pathway on CSCs in NSCLC. To this end, we firstly
examined capabilities of SFN and miR-214 in modulation
of c-MYC accumulation in response to cisplatin, which
is a commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic drug for
patients with lung cancer and is capable of inducing CSC
phenotypes in NSCLCs [23]. As showing in Figure 4A,
the untreated cells expressed basal level of c-MYC that
was downregulated when exposed to SFN for 48 hours.
In contrast, exposure of H460 cells to cisplatin strongly
induced c-MYC expression. This result is in agreement
with a previous report showing c-MYC level was
increased by cisplatin treatment [28]. Further, cisplatininduced c-MYC accumulation was potently suppressed by
co-treatment with either SFN or miR-214. Doxorubicin is
another chemotherapeutic drug for lung cancer patients.
Similarly, either SFN or miR-214 repressed doxorubicininduced c-MYC expression (Figure 4B).
We next examined the role of SFN/miR-214/c-MYC
signaling in tumor spheroid formation and CD133 surface
marker expression that are surrogates for CSCs of NSCLC

Figure 3: SFN/miR-214 signaling inhibits multiple oncoproteins. A. H460 cells were treated with SFN, miR-214 inhibitor, or

both of them for 48 hours. Expression levels of c-MYC, β-catenin, Cyclin E, EZH2, and Survivin were increased by miR-214 inhibitor and
reduced by sulforaphane treatment. Suppressive effects of SFN were attenuated by miR-214 inhibitor. Expression of PTEN was unaffected
by miR-214. B. SFN suppressed luciferase activities of psi-c-MYC-CDS (left panel) and psi-CTNNB1-3'UTR (right panel) in H460 cells

SFN increases chemotherapeutic drug-induced
toxicity in H460 cells

[23, 29]. To assess tumor spheroid formation, cells were
cultured in serum-free medium containing bFGF and EGF.
After 10 days of cultivation, floating tumor spheroids
were observed in control samples. While SFN abolished
spheroid formation, cisplatin markedly increased the
number of the spheroids (Figure 4C). However, the effect
of cisplatin was totally blocked by SFN and partially
reversed by miR-214. Next, flow cytometric analysis
with a CD133 antibody showed that CD133+ population
was enriched by cisplatin and this effect was partially
blocked by either SFN or miR-214 (Figure 4D). Aldehyde
dehydrogenase (ALDH) is another CSC marker of NSCLC
[30, 31], ALDH positive cells are highly tumorigenic,
clonogenic and capable of self-renewal. We performed
Aldefluor assay to measure ALDH+ cell population.
Similar to CD133+, ALDH+ population enriched by
cisplatin was reduced by either SFN or miR-214.

Having demonstrated the potent inhibitory effect
of SFN/mR-214 on c-MYC and giving the fact that
c-MYC plays critical roles in chemotherapy resistance
in various tumor types [28, 32] and depletion of c-MYC
with antisense RNA or RNAi restored sensitivities in
tumor cells [33, 34], we reasoned that SFN could increase
cell sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drug-mediated
cytotoxicity. As shown in Figure 5A, treatment of H460
cells with SFN or cisplatin reduced cell viability by 41%
or 45%, respectively, whereas combination of SFN with
cisplatin was more effective than either reagent used
alone and reduced cell viability by 80%. Importantly,
repressive effect of SFN on cell viability was substantially
compromised in the presence of miR-214 inhibitor,

suggesting that function of SFN is mediated by miR-214.
Further, we found that knockdown of c-MYC with siRNA
enhanced inhibitory effect of cisplatin, in agreement with
previous observations that c-MYC depletion potentiates
cisplatin sensitivity. However, this combination (Cis plus
c-MYC siRNA) was less effective than cisplatin plus
SFN, suggesting that SFN exerts its functions not only
by suppressing c-MYC, but also through other signaling
pathways such as those we demonstrated in Figure 3A.
Likewise, combined treatment with SFN and cisplatin
reduced colony formation number significantly compared
to a single reagent used alone. The effect of SFN was
attenuated by miR-214 inhibitor while cisplatin sensitivity
was enhanced by c-MYC siRNA (Figure 5B). The ability
of combined treatment to induce apoptosis was assessed
by using flow cytometric analysis with propidium iodide
and Annexin V double staining. The results showed that
SFN plus cisplatin markedly increased apoptosis when
compared to single treatments. Apoptosis-inducing effect
of SFN was diminished by miR-214 inhibitor while
the effect of cisplatin was enhanced by c-MYC siRNA,

respectively (Figure 5C). Similarly, SFN also repressed
doxorubicin-induced c-MYC expression (Figure 4B) and
enhanced its cytotoxicity (Supplementary Figure 6).

SFN sensitizes H460 cells to chemotherapy
in vivo
To further investigate whether SFN could potentiate
NSCLC cell sensitivity toward chemotherapy in vivo, we
performed experiments in xenograft model with nude
mice. H460 cells were implanted into flanks of mice
by subcutaneous injection. Mice were intraperitoneally
injected with vehicle, SFN, cisplatin or both agents
together. Compared to control group, administration
of SFN or cisplatin alone inhibited tumor growth and
tumor volumes was markedly reduced by 55% or 45%,
respectively. Combination treatment with SFN and
cisplatin further enhanced the anti-tumor effect compared
to each single treatment (Figure 6A, 6B and 6C). To
determine the in vivo effect of SFN on c-MYC expression,
tumor sections were subjected to immunohistochemical

induced c-MYC accumulation, SFN effectively inhibited
expression levels of c-MYC either in the absence or in the
presence of cisplatin (Figure 6D). These results suggested
that SFN potentiates cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity at least
partly through inhibiting c-MYC expression. In summary,
our in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated
that SFN inhibited basal level or cisplatin-stimulated
c-MYC expression in lung cancer cells, which are
accompanied by enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

and chemoresistance [28] in various malignancies, we
examined the biological consequences of SFN/miR214-mediated inhibition c-MYC in NSCLC. Our results
showed that treatment with either cisplatin or doxorubicin
stimulated c-MYC accumulation that was effectively
repressed by co-treatment with SFN or by ectopic
expression of miR-214. SFN/miR-214 inhibited CSC
properties and enhanced chemotherapeutic drug-induced
cytotoxicity. Importantly, SFN sensitized NSCLC cells
to cisplatin's efficacy in vivo, which is associated with
inhibition of cisplatin-induced c-MYC accumulation in
tumor tissues.
SFN has been shown to possess anti-CSC and
anti-tumor effect through inhibiting β-catenin in breast
cancer cells [5]. However, the mechanism by which
SFN regulates β-catenin has not been elucidated. Here
we demonstrated that similar to c-MYC, β-catenin is
also regulated by SFN via miR-214 in NSCLC cells.
Since c-MYC is a known target of β-catenin [43], thus
in addition to direct regulation by miR-214, c-MYC can
be indirectly regulated by miR-214 through β-catenin.
A recent study with transgenic β-catenin mouse models
found that constitutive activation of β-catenin signaling
in the mammary basal cell layer induces tumors similar
to that of basal-like human breast carcinomas. However,
conditional deletion of Myc from the transgenic mice
abolished the regenerative capacity of basal epithelial
cells and completely prevented the tumorigenesis. Thus,
Myc pathway activation was considered to be essential
for β-catenin-induced stem cell amplification and
tumorigenesis [44]. In this regard, direct and indirect
inhibition of c-MYC can be considered as a crucial
function of miR-214 as a tumor suppressing regulator in
NSCLC cells.
In conclusion, we demonstrated that SFN inhibited
CSC properties and enhanced therapeutic efficacy
of cisplatin in NSCLC. SFN exerted these functions
through upregulation of miR-214 expression, which
in turn targeted c-MYC, β-cantenin, and EZH2. Our
results provided strong evidence and mechanisms to
support consideration of SFN as a therapeutic agent in
combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients
with NSCLC and, potentially, other types of tumors.

DISCUSSION
c-MYC modulates a wide range of fundamental
biological processes and plays a pivotal role in tumor
initiation and progression. Deregulated c-MYC expression
is detected in most types of cancer including NSCLC and
is often associated with aggressive, poorly differentiated
tumors [35], which make c-MYC an attractive anticancer target. Though therapeutic approaches aimed
at targeting c-MYC are still not available in clinic,
remarkable progress in switching c-MYC off have been
made by researchers around the world. Recent studies
found that systemic suppression of endogenous Myc with
dominant-negative Myc mutant Omomyc triggered rapid
and complete regression of KRas-driven lung adenomas
with only mild and fully reversible side effects [36].
Inhibition of endogenous Myc with Omomyc also triggers
ubiquitous regression of tumors in a simian virus driven
pancreatic b-cell mouse tumor model [37]. These data
support the notion that inhibiting c-MYC is a promising
strategy for treating diverse malignancies. In the present
study, we provided strong evidences demonstrating that
SFN, a natural compound derived from broccoli and other
cruciferous vegetables, upregulated miR-214 that, in turn,
repressed c-MYC by binding to its CDS. This finding
was substantiated by our observations that plasmid or
lentiviral vector-mediated expression of 3'UTR-less
c-MYC cDNA and chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin- or
doxorubicin-induced endogenous c-MYC accumulation
was also suppressed by either SFN or miR-214. SFN acts
as a potent chemopreventive agent against cancer through
modulating multiple signaling pathways involved in cell
growth, apoptosis, inflammation and self-renewal of
CSCs [4, 5, 38, 39]. Our study provides key mechanistic
insights into how sulforaphane inhibits c-MYC activity,
thereby exerting its anti-cancer and CSC effects. Since
SFN treatment has shown to be safe and well tolerated in
clinic trials, using SFN as a c-MYC inhibitor may have
significant impact on effective therapeutic strategy for
patient with c-MYC-related tumors.
CSCs are intrinsically resistant to chemotherapy
and radiation therapy [40–42], therefore targeting CSCs
may provide an effective anticancer strategy to overcome
resistance and reduce recurrence. In view of recent
finding that c-MYC is a crucial regulator of CSCs [13]

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, transfection and reagents
Human normal lung bronchial epithelium cell line
BEAS-2B and NSCLC cell line H460, H1299 and A549
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA) and were routinely tested for absence of
mycoplasma using a Mycoplasma Detection Kit (Bitool,
China) in our laboratory. All cell lines were maintained in
DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. bFGF,

EGF and B27 were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA). SFN was from LKT Laboratories. Cisplatin,
Hoechst33342 and propidium iodide were from SigmaAldrich (St Louis, MO). Antibodies against c-MYC,
Cyclin E, EZH2, Survivin, and p53 were acquired from
Abcam (Cambridge, UK). Caspase 3 and cleaved caspase
3 were from Cell Signaling, Inc (Danvers, MA). β-catenin
and PTEN were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc
(Santa Cruz, CA). miRNAs and vectors were transfected
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen). The miR214 mimic, negative control, and miR-214 inhibitor were
purchased from GenePharma (Suzhou, China).

After 10 days of culture, the number of tumor spheroids
was counted under a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope
(Nikon Imaging, Japan) and the photos were acquired with
a NikonTi-U microscope (Nikon Imaging, Japan).

CD133+ cells analysis
After treatment with SFN and/or cisplatin, cells
were detached from the dishes with Trypsin-EDTA
(Invitrogen) and suspended at 1×105 cells/mL in PBS
supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. These cells were
then incubated with an anti-CD133 antibody (Miltenyi
Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) in a refrigerator
(4°C) for 10 minutes. After washing, CD133-positive cells
were detected by using a FACSAria Flow cytometer (BD
Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded in 96-well microplates at a
density of 5,000 cells per well and incubated overnight.
After treatment for 48 hours, cell viability was assessed by
MTT assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Absorbance was measured
at 590 nm using a microplate reader. Cell survival was
expressed as absorbance relative to that of untreated
controls.

Aldefluor assay and cell sorting
The Aldefluor kit (Stem Cell Technologies,
Vancouver, Canada) was used to isolate an Aldefluorstained cell population with ALDH1 enzymatic activity
[45]. The experiments were performed according to the
manufacturer's instruction. Briefly, cells were suspended
in Aldefluor assay buffer containing ALDH1-substrate,
BODIPY-aminoacetaldehyde (BAAA), and incubated for
45 min at 37°C. BAAA was converted by intracellular
ALDH into a fluorescent product BODIPY-aminoacetate,
which was detected by using a FACSAria Flow cytometer.

EdU assay
Cells were incubated with 50 μM of 5-ethynyl2'-deoxyuridine (EdU, RiboBio, Guangzhou, China)
at 37°C for 2 hours. Then, cells were fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde. After permeabilization with 0.5%
Triton-X, cells were reacted with reaction cocktail for 30
min. Subsequently, cell nucleus were stained with Hoechst
33342 for 30 min and visualized under a Nikon Eclipse
TE2000-S microscope (Nikon Imaging, Japan) and the
photos were acquired with a Nikon Ti-U microscope
(Nikon Imaging, Japan).

Western blotting analysis
After different treatment, cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer supplemented with a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Pierce Biotechnology/Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA). Cell lysate was centrifuged at 14,000
rpm for 15 minutes and the supernatant was recovered.
Protein concentration was determined with BCA Protein
Assay Reagents (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were
subject to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA).
The membrane was then incubated with appropriate
antibodies. Protein bands were detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents according to manufacturer's
instructions.

Apoptosis assay
Cells were grown in 10-cm dishes and treated with
SFN (10μmol/L). After 48 hours incubation, cells were
trypsinized, washed twice with cold PBS, and resuspended
in 500μl Annexin V-FITC binding buffer (1×107cell/mL).
Next, 5μl Annexin V FITC and 100μl PI were added into
each sample. Cells were kept in a dark place at room
temperature for 15 minutes before the proportion of
apoptosis cells were analyzed using a FACSAria Flow
cytometer (Beckton Dickson, San Jose, CA).

internal controls and fold changes were calculated through
relative quantification (2-ΔΔCt).

Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments of
Southern Medical University. Nude mice (BALB/C nu/
nu) were fed autoclaved water and laboratory rodent
chow. H460 cells (2×106 in 150μl) were transplanted into
right flanks of nude mice by subcutaneous injection (day
0). Seven days after implantation, mice carrying tumor
xenografts were randomly separated into four groups
(5 mice per group). Then mice were intraperitoneally
injected with vehicle, SFN (4mg/kg), cisplatin (3mg/kg)
or SFN (4mg/kg) plus cisplatin (3mg/kg) every 3 days for
a total of 6 doses. Tumor volumes (V) were calculated
using the formula V=1/2 (length x width2). Mice were
euthanized when the mean tumor volume in the control
group reached 500mm3. Tumor tissues were collected,
fixed in 10% formaldehyde, and embedded in paraffin for
immunohistochemical analysis of c-MYC expression.

Construction of various vectors
To construct the mammalian expression plasmid
pEGFP-c-MYC-Flag, cDNA of the full-length c-MYC
coding region was in frame inserted down-stream of the
EGFP gene in the pEGFP-C1 plasmid (Clontech, Mountain
View, CA). In addition, a double strand oligonucleotide
encoding the Flag epitope tag was chemically synthesized
and in frame cloned downstream of the c-MYC CDS. The
resulted recombinant vector contains genetic fusions of
the EGFP, c-MYC, and Flag tag. The pEGFP-c-MYCFlag mutant constructs were made by PCR using a
QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).
The oligonucleotide primers were designed to introduce
the mutations of miR-214 target sites without affecting
amino acid sequences. The psi-c-MYC-CDS luciferase
reporter vector was created by insertion of the full-length
c-MYC coding region into the Xho I and Pme I sites of
the psiCHECK-2 dual luciferase reporter (Promega,
Madison, WI). To generate the psi-1405WT, psi-1405Mut,
psi-1683WT and psi-1683Mut luciferase reporters, doublestrand oligonucleotides containing the wild-type or mutant
miR-214 binding sites were synthesized and cloned into the
Xho I and Pme I sites of the psiCHECK-2 dual luciferase
reporter. The wild or mutated full-length β-catenin gene
CTNNB1 3'UTR was cloned into the PmeI and Not I sites
of the psiCHECK-2 luciferase reporter. The sequences of
oligonucleotides were listed in Supplementary Table.
