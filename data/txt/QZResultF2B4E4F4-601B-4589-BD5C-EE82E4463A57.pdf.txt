Drug Combination Studies and Their Synergy Quantification
Using the Chou-Talalay Method

Ting-Chao Chou

Abstract
This brief perspective article focuses on the most common errors and pitfalls, as well as the do's and don'ts
in drug combination studies, in terms of experimental design, data acquisition, data interpretation, and computerized simulation. The Chou-Talalay method for drug combination is based on the median-effect equation,
derived from the mass-action law principle, which is the unified theory that provides the common link between single entity and multiple entities, and first order and higher order dynamics. This general equation
encompasses the Michaelis-Menten, Hill, Henderson-Hasselbalch, and Scatchard equations in biochemistry
and biophysics. The resulting combination index (CI) theorem of Chou-Talalay offers quantitative definition
for additive effect (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI > 1) in drug combinations. This theory also
provides algorithms for automated computer simulation for synergism and/or antagonism at any effect and
dose level, as shown in the CI plot and isobologram, respectively. Cancer Res; 70(2); 440–6. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Drug combination is most widely used in treating the most
dreadful diseases, such as cancer and AIDS. The main aims
are to achieve synergistic therapeutic effect, dose and toxicity
reduction, and to minimize or delay the induction of drug
resistance (1). Toxicity reduction and resistance minimization benefits could also be the outcomes of synergism. However, in one review article by Goldin and Mantel in 1957 (2),
seven different definitions for synergism were given, and in a
more recent review by Greco and colleagues in 1995 (3), 13
different methods for determining synergism were listed and
none of them supported the others (1). The meaning of synergism has become an individual's preference. Faulty or unsubstantiated synergy claims are pervasive. This is serious
because it is frequently referred to in patient therapy.
Without a standardized definition for synergism, it is argued that there will be a mess in making synergy claims,
whether in publishing a scientific article, submitting a grant
application, planning drug combination clinical trials for
Food and Drug Administration approval, or asserting drug
combination discovery to the Patent Office (4, 5). It is also
argued that in the absence of a clear “definition for synergism”, governmental agencies have no basis to regulate the
drug combination synergy claims (4, 5).
I have devoted over four decades on this important fundamental issue. In all, more than 300 mechanism-specific equations have been derived and published (6–13). It took about 10

The Common Pitfalls and Errors in Drug

To avoid pitfalls in drug combination studies, the following fundamental, scientific concept, and practical issues need

years to figure out what an additive effect is (1, 7, 12). This is
important, because by definition, synergism is more than an
additive effect and antagonism is less than an additive effect.
Along with Professor Paul Talalay of the Johns Hopkins
University School of Medicine, in 1983 to 1984, we jointly introduced a scientific term “combination index” (CI) to quantitatively depict synergism (CI < 1), additive effect (CI = 1),
and antagonism (CI > 1; refs. 11, 12). Its applications were
greatly facilitated by the help of Joseph Chou, who developed
the first-generation computer software for dose-effect analysis based on the “mass-action law” (14). Due to fast changes
in computer hardware and software, the second-generation
“CalcuSyn” was written by Mike Hayball of Cambridge, United Kingdom in 1997 (15), and the third-generation “CompuSyn” was then written by Nick Martin of MIT, Cambridge,
MA in 2005 (16).
The route from the unified theory to algorithms, to quantitative practical applications is shown in Fig. 1. The essence
behind the mass-action law–based theory is that the “median” is the unified common link of single entity and multiple
entities, and for the first-order and higher-order dynamics
(1). The “median” in the median-effect equation also serves
as the universal reference point, which evolves into the global
positioning system (GPS) concept for bioinformatics. The
features of this methodology are its simplicity and flexibility
(e.g., mechanism- and unit-independent), its quantitative
definition (e.g., numerically indexed conclusion), and its efficiency and economy (e.g., allows for a small number of data
points of measurements and uses a small number of animals). More details have been described in refs. 1 and 17.

Synergy Quantification Method

to be addressed. Below are my scientific views (1, 4, 5). Debates are welcome because there is an urgent need for synergy definition that requires a global consensus and
standardization.
1. The nature of the problem. Synergism is basically a
physicochemical mass-action law issue, not a statistical
issue. Determine synergism with CI values, not with
P values.
2. The P value? A combined effect greater than each drug
alone does not necessarily indicate synergism. Sometimes this can be a result of additive effect or even a
slight antagonism. A + B > A or A + B > B is a simple
axiom which does not require elaborate proof, such as
P values. Thus, if the combined effect is greater
than each drug alone, it does not necessarily indicate
synergism.
3. The arithmetic sum. The additive effect of two drugs is
not the simple “arithmetic sum” of effects of two drugs.
If (D)1 and (D)2 inhibits 30% and 40%, respectively, the
additive effect is not 70%, because if they inhibit 60%
and 70%, respectively, the additive effect cannot be
130%!
4. The fractional product concept. If (D)1 and (D)2 each
inhibit 50%, then the combined additive effect is 75%.
Is this correct? Answer: it is most likely wrong, because
it is valid only when the dose-effect curves for both
drugs are hyperbolic [i.e., follows the Michaelis-Menten
(first order) kinetics/dynamics with m = 1; ref. (18)] and
only if the effects of both drugs are mutually nonexclusive (1, 10). In simple enzyme or receptor systems,
where m is frequently ≈1, we can calculate additive
effect by (1 − 0.5) × (1 − 0.5) = 0.25, and (1 − 0.25) =
0.75 as indicated by Webb (19). However, Chou and
Talalay indicate that in cellular or animal systems, the
dose-effect curves are most likely sigmoidal (m > 1) or
flat sigmoidal (m < 1; refs. 1, 12, 13). When we talk about
the dose-effect curve, we need to take into account both
the potency (the Dm or IC50 value) and the shape of the
dose-effect curve (the m value) simultaneously, not just
pay attention to potency.
5. In vitro versus in animals. Does the determination of
synergy in vitro and in animals follow the same principle? The answer is yes. The main practical differences
in animal drug combinations are (a) it is more expensive, (b) it is more time-consuming, (c) there is more
variability, and (d) the smaller population size (i.e.,
smaller n). For anticancer drug combination studies
against xenograft tumors in nude mice under optimal
therapeutic conditions, only 65 nude mice were used
in Chou's laboratory to determine synergy with Fa-CI
plot and isobologram (5, 20, 21). By contrast, using
the empirical response surface method (3), one needs
to use ∼800 animals, and yet, the synergy conclusion
may still be vague and not quantitative. The determined synergism or antagonism is obtained from
the given experimental conditions. The extrapolation
of results from in vitro to animals, or from animals
to humans, is a general and separate biomedical prob-

www.aacrjournals.org

lem which is not expected to be solved by the ChouTalalay method.
6. Determining synergy in clinics? Is it possible to “determine” synergism in clinical trials or in clinics? The answer is generally no for the disease per se (e.g., cancer
or AIDS). This is based on scientific, practical, and ethical reasons, as indicated in ref. 1 (pp. 641–642) and in
ref. 5 (Table 1). Most clinical synergy claims thus far, to
my knowledge, are not supported by the available data,
especially when only a single dose for a single drug was
used. This is why, prior to drug combination clinical
trials, preclinical drug combination studies in vitro
and/or in animals should be carried out to obtain the
basis and rationale for studies in humans. To obtain
the therapeutic benefits of drug combination in humans, the basis and rationale involving explorative details should be obtained from preclinical studies and
should not be done entirely on human subjects. This
is the principle that the Food and Drug Administration
needs to enforce. When two drugs are combined, they
can behave like a third drug with a lot of uncertainties.
It should be noted that by using a surrogate marker
and the repeated fractional-dose schedule of multiple
doses, it is possible to determine synergy in a small-scale
clinical trial. An elegant example is using P24 antigen or
CD4+ as a marker, synergy with CI value can be obtained
in AIDS clinical trials for AZT and IFNα using only 36 patients (22). In another AIDS clinical trial for AZT and 3TC
(23), 366 patients were used, also using surrogate markers
such as CD4+ and HIV-RNA; however, this study could not
determine synergy because only a single dose of AZT was
used. It only concluded that combined therapy was better
than monotherapy alone, which is equivalent to A + B > A
or A + B > B, which is not the definition for synergy.
7. Prediction by mechanisms? Is a knowledge of mechanisms required for determining synergism? Answer: no,
because the mass-action law–based determination of
synergism is mechanism-independent. Information
about the mechanism of action is good to have for
knowledge and for guesswork. In reality, there are many
well-known drugs whose various mechanisms we know
very little about, for example, aspirin which has been
widely used for over a century. In most cases, we cannot
predict synergy from mechanisms, e.g., taxol (microtubule stabilization) + cisplatin (DNA alkylation) + topotecan (DNA topoisomerase I inhibition; ref. 1; Table 10
and ref. 24, Fig. 1). Even if it is partially predictable, it
is still not quantitative, e.g., taxol + MDR-reversing
agent, such as ningalin (25) or anti-HIV agents, ribavirin +
zidovudine (26). In addition, some drugs have several
modes of actions (e.g., upregulate or downregulate a
lot of gene expressions) and it is difficult to determine
which mode of action contributed to the synergy and to
what extent. Furthermore, there is an issue of efficiency
of research that can be raised because the quantitative
determination of synergism of two drugs in vitro usually
takes 1 to 2 weeks, but to figure out how and why synergy
occurs may take several years and the conclusion could

still likely be a “might be”, “maybe”, “suggest”, “imply”,
etc. (1, 5). Synergy or antagonism needs to be determined, not to be predicted. In this case, to determine
is easy but to predict is difficult. If synergy is predictable,
then there would be no need to conduct drug combination studies. Sometimes, the prediction might be correct
by luck but it will not be quantitative. Frequently, predictions were done after the observed facts retrospectively,
as can be seen in the biomedical literature. There has
been no rigorous theory or method to predict synergy,
except that “polygonogram”, introduced by Chou and
Chou (1, 27), can frequently project synergism or antagonism semiquantitatively (see Fig. 9 in ref. 1). This powerful and efficient projection, however, still needs a
certain amount of experimental work (e.g., project the
outcomes of three-drug or four-drug combinations
based on two-drug combinations for the semiquantitative projection of outcomes).
8. Synergism versus enhancement. Does synergism and
enhancement have the same meaning? Answer: no. Synergism (or antagonism) is “mutual” whereas enhancement, potentiation, or augmentation is “one-sided”
(1, 5). Synergism or antagonism needs to be determined
with CI values, whereas for enhancement, potentiation,
or augmentation, we simply just need to state x% potentiation or y-fold enhancement, etc. When a drug
but itself has no effect, there will be no Dm and m values
for calculating CI.
9. Efficiency and economy. Based on Chou's theory, is it
possible to draw a specific curve with only two data
points? Answer: yes, if they are accurately determined
(1, 5, 17). This statement defies the widely held belief
that from two data points, we can only draw a straight
line. Here, the two points is actually four points. The
third point is the origin at dose zero, and the fourth
point is the median, which is the common link and
universal reference point for the first-order and higher
order kinetics/dynamics, as well as for the single entity
and multiple entities (1, 5, 17). When the mass-action
law parameters (Dm for potency and m for shape) are determined by the median-effect plot (Chou plot), the entire dose-effect curve is automatically determined (e.g.,
using CompuSyn software simulation; ref. 16). This is
the basis for the GPS concept for bioinformatics proposed by Chou. This concept should have far-reaching
consequences in biomedical research, in terms of efficiency and economy, and in the conservation of human

workforce, materials, and animal resources. This is exemplified in the CI method for drug combination studies,
discussed in this brief perspective article. More details
are given in refs. (1, 5, 17).

Frequently Asked Questions for the CI Method
and “Do's and Don'ts”
Given below are frequently asked questions for the
Chou-Talalay CI method, in terms of experimental design,
data entry, data analysis with CompuSyn software, and
other practical questions. I will try to give answers clearly,
but briefly. For more details, please refer to refs. 1 and 5.
For simplicity, the following discussions refer to two-drug
combinations in vitro. The questions or issues are itemized
below for easy references, in a random order.
1. Why do you recommend the constant-ratio drug combinations? The cells do not know it is a single drug or
drug combination, nor its combination ratio, nor their
mechanisms, etc. We just enter the “dose” and “effect”
for each drug and combination's numerical information
to the computer. When we make a mixture and dilute it
serially (usually 2-fold serial dilution with several concentration points above and below its IC50 value), it will
always stay at a constant ratio [at the (IC50)1/(IC50)2 ratio or other selected ratio; refs. (1, 5), if you have reason(s)
to do so, such as solubility limit or intend to de-emphasize
one drug over others to avoid bad toxicity or side effects; refs. (1, 5, 12, 28)]. This mixture, in fact, behaves
like a third drug to the cells. In this way, we can obtain
the parameters [(Dm)1,2, (m)1,2 and (r)1,2 for the mixture,
just like the single drugs (Dm)1, (m)1, (r)1 and (Dm)2, (m)2,
(r)2] by using the automated median-effect plot (the
Chou plot) with a computer software. The r value is
the linear correlation coefficient of the median-effect
plot, which signifies the conformity of the data to the
mass-action law. For in vitro experiments, it usually
yields r > 0.97. The advantage is that they allow the automated computer simulation for the Fa-CI plot (CI
plot or Chou-Talalay plot), Fa-DRI plot (dose-reduction
index plot or Chou-Martin plot), and the classic isobologram (and if there are more than two drugs, the polygonogram or Chou-Chou graphics), in addition to the
dose-effect curves and the median-effect plot. If the experiment is carried out in non-constant ratio combinations (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:5, and 1:10), the CI values can still be
determined at their corresponding specified data points,

B, the merging of the median-effect equation with the CI equation leads to the quantitative definition for synergism (CI < 1), additive effect (CI = 1),
and antagonism (CI > 1), and provides the algorithms for their computer simulation. Rearrangement of the equation also provides algorithms for simulation
of dose-reduction index (DRI) for each drug in their combination. The favorable DRI (>1) allows dose-reduction that leads to toxicity reduction in the
therapeutic applications. C, the depiction of typical quantitative diagnostic graphics generated by the computer simulation. a, the Fa-CI plot (Chou-Talalay

combination design. d, the Fa-DRI plot (Chou-Martin plot) for the constant ratio combination design. When all single drug parameters (m and Dm values)
are available, the CI values can be calculated for the non-constant ratio combinations. But no computer simulation for Fa-CI plot or the Fa-DRI plot
is possible due to changing ratios (A is reproduced from ref. 13 with permission from Elsevier. B and C are reproduced from ref. 1 with permission from the

if the (m)1, (Dm)1 and (m)2, (Dm)2 for single drugs are
available, but no “simulation” for the CI plot. In nonconstant ratio design, the DRI plot can be done for
specific data points but with no simulations, and the
computer-generated classic isobologram (usually from
the constant-ratio combinations) will be replaced with
the computer-generated “normalized isobologram”
(or the Chou-Chou conservative isobologram; refs.
1, 26). Typical representations of the classic and conservative isobolograms are shown in Fig. 1C (and in Fig. 9
of ref. 1 or Fig. 5 of ref. 5). If one prefers to have more
information of more than one combination ratio, and if
the experimental size and cost are of less concern (especially when facing animal studies), it is recommended
to use a checkerboard or Latin square design, in which
several constant-combination ratios are provided, as
shown in Tables 5, 8, and 9 of ref. 1).
2. What is the prerequisite for all drug combination
studies? Answer: the prerequisite is the dose-effect
curves for each drug alone. Each drug not only has a
different potency (the Dm value) but also a different
shape of the dose-effect curve (the m value). For any determination of synergy, we need to know both the potency and the shape of the dose-effect curve of each
drug (1, 5, 12). The Dm and m values can easily (and automatically) be obtained from the median-effect equation using computer software (e.g., CompuSyn) or by
using a pocket calculator. For examples of manual calculations, see Table 10 in ref. 1. With these parameters
[(m)1, (Dm)1 and (m)2, (Dm)2] available, we could determine whether there is synergism or antagonism, quantitatively, by using the CI equation, even for only a single
combination data point (1). However, if multiple data
points for constant-ratio combination are available [i.e.,
(Dm)1,2 and (m)1,2], then the entire spectrum of synergism or antagonism at all effect levels can be automatically simulated. Thus, the hypothetical minimum for a
drug combination study is five data points, in which
two are for (D)1, two are for (D)2, and one for the combination. For reasons of biological and technical variability, of course, we do not advocate the use of
minimum data points. However, the median-effect principle (MEP) provides the legitimacy of using a small
number of data points if variability is in a small magnitude (1, 5, 17).
3. Dose range and dose density questions. It is ideal to
have several data points above IC50 and several below
IC50 because this would make the assay more accurate.
Because the unified theory of the median-effect equation and plot is general and versatile, it can easily handle
screwed data points in which it's all above IC50 or all
below IC50, if the assays are accurate, and with a good
r value (e.g., r > 0.95; refs. 1, 14–16). Although the dose
range is very flexible for analytic purposes, it is important to realize whether the concentration range used
in vitro is achievable in vivo, and whether these concentrations are within the tolerable toxicity in vivo. As
a common rule, do not delete the data points in the

444

Cancer Res; 70(2) January 15, 2010

middle of the dose-effect curve, unless there are specific
reasons (e.g., inadvertent error or accident). However, at
extremely high concentrations or at extremely low concentrations, where accurate assays are not possible (i.e.,
beyond the sensitivity of detection), the unreliable data
points should be deleted (1). Otherwise, the computer
software (based on the median-effect equation and plot)
takes into account every data point equally significantly.
Never enter 0% or 100% inhibition (fa = 0 or fa = 1) into
the computer because log 0 = negative infinity (at infinitely low concentration) and log 1 = 0 (at infinitely high
concentration) will lead the computer to crash (14–16).
4. What does extraordinarily high CI value mean?
Sometimes the CI values are >3 or much greater, especially at low effect levels (i.e., low fa level). Don't be
surprised! Keep in mind that the synergy scale is from
1 to 0 and the antagonism scale is from 1 to infinity.
Frequently, at high dose or high effect levels, the synergistic interaction is stronger than otherwise. For anticancer or antiviral agents, synergy at high effect levels
(e.g., at fa > 0.8) is more relevant to therapy than at
low effect levels (e.g., at fa < 0.2). A semiquantitative expression of CI ranges for synergism (or antagonism) in
symbols, colors, and grades (slight, moderate, substantial, strong, and very strong) are recommended in Table
4 of ref. 1.
5. What is the scope of applications of the MEP and the
CI method? The MEP of Chou (i.e., the median-effect
equation and the median-effect plot; refs. 7 and 8) and
the extended CI theorem of Chou-Talalay (i.e., the CI
equation and plot; ref. 12) are derived from Nature's fundamental mass-action law in biophysics and biochemistry. The theory of MEP (for single entity) and of CI (for
multiple entities) should be generally applicable in all
dose-effect relationships that follow the mass-action
law (i.e., with good r values; refs. 1, 17). The derivation
of these equations is accomplished by using the mathematical induction/deduction from more than 300 mechanism-specific equations. As shown in refs. (7–10), the
general equations are valid with different reaction mechanisms, different types of mechanisms of inhibition,
and with different numbers of reactants.The broad application is attested by the fact that MEP and CI have
been cited in more than 3,970 scientific articles globally,
based on the Thompson ISI Web of Science search. It is
of interest to note that one review article on drug combination by Chou and Talalay (12), which was published
in a journal with an impact factor of 1.83, has now been
cited in more than 1,915 scientific articles internationally from over 407 different biomedical journals. The CI
method helps answer the following primary questions
(1, 5): (a) Are there any synergisms? (b) How much
synergism? (c) Synergism at what dose levels? (d) Synergism at what effect levels? (e) What did the exhibited CI
plot, isobologram, and polygonogram look like? (f) How
many folds of dose-reduction (for toxicity reduction) for
each drug as a result of synergism? All of the above tasks
could be accomplished with computerized simulation

for experiments, which normally takes ∼1 to 2 weeks for
the in vitro experiment to complete. For a slight alteration in experimental design, one can also answer these
other questions: (g) the optimal combination ratio for
maximal synergy, (h) the schedule dependency of synergy, (i) the selectivity of synergy against the target versus
the host, and (j) the condition-directed synergism, such
as the influence of pH, temperature, radiation, and oxygen tension, etc., on the synergistic outcome. The major
advantages of this theory are its sound theoretical basis,
general validity for broad application, and the algorithm
for computer simulation. The overwhelming significance of the theory is its features of simplicity, efficiency, and economy, which have influenced the face of
biomedical research in a measurable way. The validity
of the MEP is, without a doubt, because it is the unified
form of Michaelis-Menten, Hill, Henderson-Hasselbalch,
and Scatchard equations, which are the main theories
of biochemistry and biophysics (Fig. 1A). As indicated
in refs. 1 and 17, the CI concept and its application is
just an extension of the MEP. There are many other
utilities on the horizon that can be applied to the
median-effect equation and its principles (1), which include (a) conducting small-sized experimentations; (b)
conservation of use of laboratory animals; (c) low-dose
risk assessment of carcinogens, radiation, or toxic substances; (d) calculation of Ki from IC50; (e) agricultural
control of pests; (f) topologic analysis of exclusivity
and competitiveness; (g) calculation of therapeutic index and safety margin; and (h) epidemiologic applications, such as age-specific disease incidences and their
projections. These are just to mention a few. The overall
significance of the median-mediated unity theory is its
economic enabling of increasing efficiency for biomedical research, and the conservation of human workforce,
materials, and animal resources. It also benefits the humanistic side on improving health and well-being by defining and determining synergism to avoid faulty
synergism claims and confusions (1), and quickening

the new drug discovery process by using the efficient
quantitative approach for drug evaluation and the GPS
concept for bioinformatics (17).

Conclusions and Future Directions
The CI is the natural law–based general expression of
pharmacologic drug interactions. It is shown to be the simplest possible way for quantifying synergism or antagonism.
Its simplicity in equations, experimental designs, and data
analysis features efficiency, economy, and reducing the experimental size of animals used or the number of patients
needed for drug combination clinical trials. The general theory of the MEP of the mass-action law, its CI algorithm, and
its computerized simulation have paved the way for future
drug combination studies, as indicated by the broad acceptance in scientific applications and by the rapid increase in
citation numbers.
