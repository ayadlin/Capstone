ABSTRACT:
The ribosomal P70 S6 kinases play a crucial role in PI3K/mTOR regulated
signalling pathways and are therefore potential targets for the treatment of a variety
of diseases including diabetes and cancer. In this study we describe the identification
of three series of chemically distinct S6K1 inhibitors. In addition, we report a novel
PKA-S6K1 chimeric protein with five mutations in or near its ATP-binding site, which
was used to determine the binding mode of two of the three inhibitor series, and
provided a robust system to aid the optimisation of the oxadiazole-substituted
benzimidazole inhibitor series. We show that the resulting oxadiazole-substituted
aza-benzimidazole is a potent and ligand efficient S6 kinase inhibitor, which blocks
the phosphorylation of RPS6 at Ser235/236 in TSC negative HCV29 human bladder
cancer cells by inhibiting S6 kinase activity and thus provides a useful tool compound
to investigate the function of S6 kinases.

INTRODUCTION

In turn, S6K1 is activated by phosphorylation of
the activation loop residue Thr252 (S6K1 numbering) by
PDK1, and by phosphorylation of Thr412, located in the
kinase extension region. Phosphorylation of Thr412 is
achieved by mTORC1, which is a heterotrimeric complex
comprising mTOR, raptor and mLST-8 [1]. However, for
full activation of S6K1, these phosphorylation events have
to be preceded by phosphorylation of a series of serine and
threonine residues in the C-terminal autoinhibitory domain
and by phosphorylation of Ser394 in the turn-motif [8].
The identification of S6K1 as a potential therapeutic
target in oncology is supported by the fact that the S6K1
gene (RPS6KB1) is located at human chromosome
17q23, a region that is amplified in 20% of primary
breast cancers as measured by comparative genomic
hybridisation [9]. In addition, increased expression of

The 70 KDa ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K) RPS6KB1
(S6K1) and RPS6KB2 (S6K2) are key effectors of PI3K/
mTOR-regulated signalling, and have been implicated
in a variety of human diseases including diabetes and
cancer [1-5]. They belong to the family of AGC kinases
and are highly homologous with a sequence identity of
83% in their catalytic domains [6]. S6K1, which is the
most extensively studied of the two, has been shown to
phosphorylate a number of substrates that regulate protein
synthesis, including the 40S ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6),
and proteins involved in translation, such as the eukaryotic
initiation factor 4B (EIF4B) and eukaryotic elongation
factor 2 kinase [7].

S6K1 has been associated with cell transformation and
elevated proliferation rates in tumours [10, 11]. Moreover,
amplification and overexpression of S6K1 have been
linked with poor prognosis and an increased risk of local
recurrence [12]. Studies in cultured cells have confirmed
that S6K activity is enhanced by mechanisms activating
the PI3-kinase/Akt/mTOR pathway, such as loss of the
tumour suppressor PTEN, and have shown a positive
correlation between S6K activity and tumour growth
[13]. In addition, loss of either of the tumour suppressive
TSC1/2 complex proteins can result in activation of
mTORC1 and S6K. The TSC2 protein acts as a GTPaseactivating protein (GAP) towards Rheb (Ras homologue
enriched in brain) and promotes conversion of active
Rheb-GTP into the inactive form, Rheb-GDP, that can
no longer stimulate mTORC1 [14]. Furthermore, S6K1
regulates the turnover of the oncogenic protein MDM2 in
the ovarian cancer cell line OVCAR-3 [15]. In DU-145
prostate cancer cells, S6K1 increased survivin expression
produced by upstream activation of the pathway, whereas
acute ablation of endogenous S6K1 by small interfering
RNA down-regulated survivin levels [16]. Finally,
increased phosphorylation of S6K and corresponding
phosphorylation of RPS6 was observed in HPV16-infected
cervical cancer tissue samples [17], and the constitutive
activation of S6K1 is associated with cisplatin resistance
in human H69 small cell lung cancer cells [18].
Ribosomal S6 kinases are thus interesting
therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. In this study we
describe a high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign
against S6K1 using an amplified luminescent proximity
homogeneous assay, and the subsequent hit evaluation for
the three hit series we identified. In addition, we report
a novel PKA-S6K1 chimeric protein, which was used to
elucidate the binding mode of two of the HTS hit series
including the improved C-6-substituted azabenzimidazole
S6K inhibitors. Finally, for the most potent compound
from the azabenzimidazole series we demonstrate
inhibition of S6K in intact human bladder tumour cells
exhibiting loss of expression of the TSC1/2 complex.

inhibitor staurosporine, but the authors were not able to
generate an apo-S6K1 structure, which they attributed to
a susceptibility of the apo-enzyme to aggregation upon
concentration and upon storage. Whilst the published
S6K1 crystal structures provided an exciting first
structural insight in S6 kinases, the crystal system might
be less applicable to iterative protein-ligand structural
studies informing the structure-based design of potent S6K
inhibitors.
In order to generate a more robust crystal system
suitable for the generation of high-resolution proteinligand structural data required to facilitate S6K inhibitor
design, we decided to develop a S6K1 chimeric protein
based on the catalytic subunit of the closely related
AGC kinase PKAα (PKA). Chimeric proteins based on
PKA have been successfully used in the discovery of
PKB inhibitors [20, 21], the analysis of Aurora kinase
inhibitors [22], and to study the selectivity determinants
of Rho kinase inhibitors [23]. S6K1 and PKA share a
sequence identity of approximately 33% in their kinase
domains and their ATP-binding sites are nearly identical.
Our PKA-S6K1 chimera was created by mutation of five
residues in or near the ATP-binding site (F54Y, M120L,
V123L, L173M and Q181K) that differ between the two
kinases. Analogous to PKA and other PKA-based chimeric
proteins, the PKA-S6K1 chimera could be expressed in
E. coli and the tetra-phosphorylated enzyme purified
using a protocol described previously (see Materials and
Methods). Co-crystals of purified PKA-S6K1 chimera
with PKA inhibitor peptide (PKI, residues 5-24) were
successfully grown, routinely diffracted to between 1.5 and
2.0 Å resolution, and ternary complexes with inhibitors
could easily be obtained using soaking experiments.
To validate the PKA-S6K1 chimera as a
structural surrogate for S6K1, we solved the structure
of staurosporine bound to the PKA-S6K1 chimera and
compared it with the publicly available staurosporinebound crystal structures of PKA (PDB code: 1STC) and
the phosphorylated and partially activated S6K1 (PDB
code: 3A62). As expected, the overall conformations of
the staurosporine-bound PKA and PKA-S6K1 structures
are nearly identical (rmsd 0.51 Å for 330 equivalent Cα
atoms, Figure 1), except for residues 316 to 320 in the
C-terminal tail, which adopt a different conformation in
the PKA-S6K1 chimera compared to PKA (Figure 1A).
In both structures, the PDK1 phosphorylation site in the
activation loop (Thr197) is in its phosphorylated state, the
activation loop is in an optimal conformation for substrate
binding and both structures are ternary complexes with
the peptide inhibitor PKI. However, it is important to
note that the binding of staurosporine induces substantial
conformational changes in the structure of PKA [24] and
therefore also in the structure of the PKA-S6K1 chimera.
During its catalytic cycle, the conformation of the PKA
kinase domain shuttles between an open unliganded
conformation, and a closed ATP- and substrate-bound

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A PKA-S6K1 Chimera for Structure-Based Drug
Design.
To date, the available structural data for S6 kinases
are limited to three crystal structures of the S6K1 kinase
domain. Two structures are of unphosporylated S6K1 and
consistent with an inactive state of the kinase. The third
is of S6K1 phosphorylated on Thr252 in the activation
loop and consistent with a partially activated state of the
kinase [19]. The three crystal structures of S6K1 were
solved as protein-ligand complexes with the pan-kinase

conformation, which together with several intermediate
conformations, have been captured in different PKA
crystal structures [25]. Both the staurosporine-bound
PKA and PKA-S6K1 structures are most similar to an
intermediate conformation represented by the adenosinebound PKA structure (PDB code: 1BKX), in which the
P-loop adopts a conformation halfway between the fully
open and closed forms of the kinase (Figure 1C). In both
staurosporine-bound crystal structures, changes in the side
chain conformations of residues lining the respective ATPbinding sites help to accommodate the binding of the bulky
staurosporine molecule. The biggest differences include
the conformation of the respective Phe54 or Tyr54 residue
at the tip of the P-loop, which in both structures is tucked
underneath the loop and points towards staurosporine,

and the conformation of Phe327 in the C-terminal tail,
whose side chain is not only shifted, but also rotated by
approximately 90 degrees to allow binding of the inhibitor
(Figure 1C).
The construct used to elucidate the native S6K1
structure lacks 75 N-terminal residues and 126 C-terminal
residues of the S6K1 sequence. In addition, the S6K1
crystallographic coordinates lack a further 10 N-terminal
residues and 27 C-terminal residues due to disorder
of these residues within the crystals used for structure
elucidation. Therefore, the native S6K1 crystal structures
do not contain the C-terminal auto-inhibitory domain and
the majority of the characteristic AGC kinase C-terminal
tail [26], which folds back from the C-terminal lobe
across the ATP-binding site to the N-terminal lobe, is not

not displayed for clarity. Phe327 in the C-terminal tail and the aromatic residue at the tip of the P-loop (Tyr54/Phe54) adopt different

present. Although the S6K1 construct is considerably
shorter than the PKA and PKA-S6K1 chimera sequences,
the overall tertiary SK61 structure is very similar to the
PKA-S6K1 chimera (rmsd 1.33 Å for 247 equivalent Cα
atoms, Figure 1B). The most notable differences with the
PKA-S6K1 chimera include the disordered αB-helix and
partially disordered activation loop and αC-helix, which
are consistent with the low activity of the phospho-Thr252
form of the enzyme. The binding-mode of staurosporine
to native S6K1 and the PKA-S6K1 chimera is nearly
identical, and the amino acid residues lining the respective
ATP-binding sites and contacting staurosporine have very
similar side chain conformations. The exception is the
conformation of the tyrosine residue (Tyr102 in S6K1
and Tyr54 in PKA-S6K1) at the tip of the P-loop, which
extends outward in S6K1, but is folded back underneath
the P-loop in the PKA-S6K1 chimera (Figure 1D). This
could potentially be a cause of differences in inhibitorbinding between native S6K1 and the PKA-S6K1 chimera,
but because of the high similarity of the overall kinase
domain structures and the very minor differences in side
chain conformations within the respective staurosporineoccupied ATP-binding sites, we concluded that the PKAS6K1 chimera was a suitable, robust and high-resolution
surrogate system to guide our structure-based S6K
inhibitor design.

exclude compounds active through aggregation, all initial
hits were reanalysed using the same assay conditions in
the presence of Triton™ X100 [27]. The 67 resulting hits
(confirmed hit rate 0.1%) were inspected for chemical
tractability, toxicophores and undesired compounds, which
left 19 progressible hits of which 12 were commercially
available and repurchased for further analysis. The IC50
values of 11 of the 12 hits ranged from 0.25 to 22.6
μM, but the remaining compound did not reconfirm in
a secondary DELFIA phosphorylation assay and was
therefore discarded.

The resulting confirmed HTS hits could be grouped
into three chemical series and three singletons. The three
chemical series were prioritised for investigation.

comprised
three
carboxamidobenzimidazoles (1 – 3) with respective IC50
values of 0.56 μM, 1.04 μM and 10.14 μM (Figure 3 and

including molecular weights ≤ 283 Da, ClogP ≤ 2.1, total
polar surface areas (tPSA) ≤ 97 Å2, and their good ligand
efficiencies made them an attractive series for further
investigation.

To identify inhibitors of S6K1, an HTS using
an AlphaScreen™ kinase assay was carried out which
measured the inhibition of the catalytic domain of S6K1
by the reduction in phosphorylation of an RPS6 substrate
peptide. A compound library of approximately 67,000
compounds with lead-like properties was screened at a
final concentration of 30 μM. With a mean Z’ factor of
0.69 ± 0.07 (CV% = 9.3) the overall performance of the
HTS was considered to be good (Figure 2). A total of 414
hits were identified yielding an initial hit rate of 0.6%. To

Figure 3: Carboxamidobenzimidazole hits
The carboxamidobenzimidazoles are known
inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) with
activities in the low nanomolar range [28] and therefore
our first aim was to attempt to divorce their S6K1 and
PARP activities. It is known that the 4-carboxamide
and its intramolecular hydrogen bond to the N-3 of the
benzimidazole are crucial for PARP activity as this mimics
the natural cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NAD+). Replacement of the amide by a carboxylic acid
group gave compound 4, which is known to be inactive
against PARP but also led to loss of activity against S6K1.
Similarly, the N-methyl amide 5 was inactive against
S6K1, as was the regioisomeric 5-carboxamide 6, which is
another carboxamidobenzimidazole lacking PARP activity
[28]. Initial docking studies and subsequent determination
of the crystal structure of compound 1 bound to the PKAS6K1 chimera showed that the 4-carboxamide group is
involved in crucial hydrogen interactions with the hinge
region (Figure 4A), which explains the loss of potency
upon modifications in this area of the molecule. The
phenol group of 1 extends past the medium-sized Leu120

features of these 2-arylbenzimidazole-4-carboxamides

further.

developing a new synthetic route to this series [29], it
proved impossible to develop any directional structureactivity relationships (SAR), which led us to discard this
series.
The third hit series consisted of the two
N-alkylbenzimidazoles compound 10 and compound 11
which both have an amino-oxadiazole substituent at the
C-2 position (Figure 6). Their respective IC50 values of
340 nM and 7.0 μM translate to good ligand efficiencies
(Table 3). At the start of our programme, compounds
containing this ring system had been reported as inhibitors
of the AGC kinases mitogen and stress-activated protein

the potencies and ligand efficiencies (Table 2) were still
attractive. However, upon resynthesis of these compounds,
it became clear that their physicochemical properties
are far from ideal. Obtaining reliable assay results was

crystal structure of the PKA-S6K1 chimera bound to
15e (Figure 7a) shows that its cyclopropylmethyl group
fits snugly in a hydrophobic pocket formed by Gly50,
Tyr54, Val57, and Phe327, as proposed by Banderage
et al. [33], and suggests that this pocket is too small to
accommodate the benzyl group of 15d. Superposition of
15e on the staurosporine-bound S6K1 structure shows that
the compound also fits in the native S6K1 ATP binding
site, but owing to the disorder in the S6K1 C-terminal tail
and the different conformation of the P-loop, the presence
of the hydrophobic pocket binding the cyclopropyl group
could not be verified (Figure 7b).

Acetylation on the exocyclic amino group of the
aminooxadiazole moiety renders this series inactive
against S6K, as shown by compound 16, with an IC50 value
of greater than 100 μM (Scheme 2). This is consistent with
the binding mode observed in the 15e-bound PKA-S6K1
structure, in which the oxadiazole group binds to the hinge
by the formation of a hydrogen bond between its N-2 atom
and the backbone amide group of Leu123 and through a
hydrogen bond between the exocyclic amino group with
the backbone carbonyl of Glu121. Although the closely
related acetylated compound 16 could in principle still
form these hydrogen bonds, in this binding mode the
acetyl group would clash with the gatekeeper residue
Leu120 and Val104, situated at the bottom of the ATPbinding site.

of C-5 and C-7 substituted benzimidazoles
(Scheme 3).

Modifications on the benzene ring at the C-5 and
C-7 positions were investigated as shown in Scheme
3. Preparation of the requisite bromo-precursors 20a
and 20f (Scheme 3) allowed the synthesis of analogues
incorporating phenyl (20b), cyclopropyl (20c), methoxy
(20d) and methylamino (20e) on the R1 position and
3-pyridyl on the R2 position (20f, Scheme 3). However,
unfortunately none of these modifications yielded an
improvement in potency (Table 5).

Azabenzimidazoles.
In order to diversify this scaffold, we chose to
replace the benzimidazole ring with an azabenzimidazole.
Azabenzimidazole aminooxadiazoles have been reported
as potent Rho kinase inhibitors and upon analysis of their
selectivity profile were also found to have a strong affinity
for S6K [34]. Therefore we synthesised a limited set of
azabenzimidazole analogues from the bromo-precursor
21a using the synthetic route reported (see Scheme 4)
[34]. Interestingly, 21a (Table 6) was equipotent with the
N-1 cyclopropyl-substituted benzimidazole oxadiazole
15c. Introduction of a phenoxy group in the C-6 position
(21b) conferred some activity as already suggested by

Comparison of the binding modes of identified
S6K1 inhibitors.
The PKA-S6K1 inhibitor structures described in
this paper are most similar to the intermediate adenosinebound PKA conformation (PDB code: 1BKX). In all
structures, Phe327 adopts a conformation similar to the
one observed in PKA and consistent with shielding the
bound ligand from the solvent.
The carboxamidobenzimidazole 1 is the only
inhibitor which binds in the selectivity pocket, whereas
the benzimidazole-oxadiazole 15e and azabenzimidazoleoxadiazoles 21a and 21e bind in a very similar manner
exploiting the small hydrophobic pocket formed by
Phe327 from the C-terminal tail, Gly50 and Tyr54 from the
P-loop (Figure 9A). Interestingly, in the benzimidazole and
azabenzimidazole inhibitors the aromatic Tyr54 at the tip
of the P-loop closes in over the inhibitor and packs against
the hydrophobic side of the inhibitors. In compounds 21a
and 21e, Tyr 54 interacts with the respective bromine
and methyl groups, but the effect is most pronounced for
compound 15e, which is unsubstituted in this position
allowing Tyr54 to interact directly with the core scaffold
of the inhibitor (Figure 9B). The closing of the P-loop over
these inhibitors effectively shields them from the solvent,
which together with the hydrophobic stacking interactions
is likely to contribute to the potency of these inhibitors.

The IC50 values were determined with a mobility shift assay
and expressed as the mean ± standard deviation for triplicate
measurements. bMean value from duplicate measurement ±

the selectivity studies on Rho kinase. Substitution with a
phenyl group at C-6 (21c) turned out to be detrimental
and abolished all affinity for S6K1. An attempt to improve
the physicochemical properties by introducing amino-side
chains such as a morpholine group α-to the N-atom (21d)
also proved unsuccessful. However, the methyl-substituted
compound 21e represented the most potent inhibitor
within this series, and with its ligand efficiency of 0.6
could prove to be an attractive tool compound for further
S6K studies (Table 6).
The binding mode of both the synthetic precursor
21a and 21e was determined by solving the crystal
structures of these inhibitors in complex with the PKAS6K1 chimera (Figure 8). Both compounds bind to

METHODS

We examined the activity of the substitutedazabenzimidazole 21e (CCT239066) in a human bladder
carcinoma line (HCV29) that has activated mTOR
signalling as a result of losing expression of the TSC
complex which allows activation of mTORC1 [35].
CCT239066 (21e) inhibits S6K1 with IC50 values of
17.4 ± 6.0 nM and S6K2 at 300 ± 102 nM respectively
and demonstrated 50% tumour growth inhibition
(GI50) at a concentration of 3.5 μM following 96 hours
continuous exposure. CCT239066 (21e) also inhibited
phosphorylation of a biomarker of S6K1 activity,
phosphorylation of RPS6 at Ser235/236 (Figure 10) in
intact cells. The EC50 for 50% inhibition of Ser235/236
phosphorylation following 2 hours exposure was 9.1 ±
1.5 μM (n=3) compared to IC50 values > 15 μM for AKTThr308, AKT-Ser473, GSK3b-Ser9 and S6K-Ser421/424
as determined by electrochemoluminescent ELISA in
intact cells.
In conclusion, we have identified three different
chemical series of S6 kinase inhibitors. Optimisation of
the benzimidazole oxadiazole series resulted in a potent,
ligand efficient azabenzimidazole S6K1/S6K2 inhibitor
with good physicochemical properties and cellular activity.
In addition, we developed a novel robust crystallography
system based on a PKA-S6K1 chimera and experimentally
determined the binding mode of two of the three inhibitor
series, including the improved and cellularly active
azabenzimidazole inhibitor. The availability of both
a robust crystallography system and cellularly active
tool compounds will aid the future design of potent and
selective S6K inhibitors.

High-throughput screening of S6K1.
The catalytic domain of S6K1 was screened against
our in-house HTS library of lead-like compounds using
an AlphaScreen™ kinase assay in which inhibition of
S6K1 was measured by a reduction in the phosphorylation
of a S6 peptide. Compounds were screened at a final
concentration of 30 μM and 0.3% (v/v) DMSO by
dispensing 3 μL compound solution from a source plate
containing the compounds at a concentration of 200
μM in 2% (v/v) DMSO, into the central 320 wells of a
polypropylene 384-well assay plate (#781287; Greiner
Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany). 0.3% (v/v) DMSO
was used as a vehicle control. 17 μL of the reaction
mixture containing 1 nM S6K1 (#14-486; Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA), 30 μM ATP and 250 nM S6 peptide
(Biotin-KRRRLSSLRASTSKSESSQKI, synthesised by
J. Metcalfe, ICR) in assay buffer consisting of 40 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT and 0.02%
(v/v) Tween 20, was added to the compound plate and
incubated for an hour at room temperature. Each 384 well
plate contained 32 control wells for total enzyme activity,
no enzyme blanks and the positive control, staurosporine
at a final concentration of 20 nM. The reaction was
stopped by the addition of 80 μL of 50 mM EDTA pH
7.5. An aliquot containing 10 μL of the assay solution
was transferred to a white OptiPlate™ (#6007299;
PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA).

MiniTrak™ V (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) was used for
compound and reagent addition. Primary screening data
were analysed in ActivityBase (IDBS, Guildford, UK).
Compounds with a percentage inhibition of 50% or better
were classed as initial hits. All hits were cherry-picked
and re-assayed in triplicate to confirm activity. In addition,
the hits were tested for aggregation by assaying them in
triplicate with 0.01% (v/v) Triton™ X-100 added to the
assay buffer.

Crystallisation and structure determination.
Crystallisation of the PKA-S6K1 chimera was
performed using the same conditions as previously
reported for the PKA/PKB chimera [21]. Prior to
crystallisation, the purified protein was concentrated to
18 mg/mL in crystallisation buffer consisting of 25 mM
MES-Bis/Tris pH 6.5, 75 mM LiCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1
mM octanoyl-N-methylglucamide and 1 mM DTT and
containing 1 mM PKA-inhibitor peptide PKI (residues
5-24, Sigma-Aldrich) or an in-house synthesised
peptide corresponding to residues 5-22 of the PKAinhibitor peptide, but terminating with an amide at the

C-terminus. Crystals of the PKA-S6K1/PKI staurosporine
ternary complex were obtained by streak-seeding into
fresh hanging drops containing the same protein and
reservoir solutions as used for the crystallisation of the
binary PKA-S6K1/PKI complex, with the addition
of 0.5 mM staurosporine. All other protein-inhibitor
complexes were obtained by soaking experiments of
selected inhibitors at a final concentration of 1 mM as
previously described for PKA [21]. Crystals were briefly
transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 22.5%
(v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol, 25 mM MES-Bis/Tris
pH 6.5, 0.1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT, prior to flashcooling in liquid nitrogen. The data for the binary PKAS6K1/PKI complex were collected at beamline ID14EH2
at the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Data for the ternary
PKA-S6K1/PKI/inhibitor complexes were collected at
the following beamlines: staurosporine- and compound
1-bound complexes were collected at beamline I02 of the
Diamond Light Source (Oxfordshire, UK) and the data for
the protein-inhibitor complexes with compounds 15e, 21a,
and 21e were collected at beamline ID14EH4 at the ESRF.
All data sets were integrated, merged and scaled using the
programs iMosflm [36], Pointless and Aimless [37, 38]
from the CCP4 suite [39] (see Supplementary Table S1 for
data collection and refinement statistics). The PKA-S6K1/
PKI structure was solved by molecular replacement using
PHASER [40] with a PKA structure (PDB code: 2GFC)
as a search model, after removal of all water molecules
and truncation of the 5 mutated amino acids to alanine.
All protein-inhibitor structures were solved by molecular
replacement with the PKA-S6K1/PKI structure as a search
model after removal of all water molecules. All structures
were manually rebuilt in COOT [41] and refined with
BUSTER [42] in iterative cycles. Ligand restraints were
generated with Grade [43] and Mogul [44]. The quality
of the structures was assessed with MOLPROBITY [45].
