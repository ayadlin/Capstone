Abstract
Pemetrexed (ALIMTA, Lilly) is a folate antimetabolite that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of non–small cell lung cancer and has been shown to stimulate autophagy. In
the present study, we sought to further understand the role of autophagy in response to pemetrexed and to test if
combination therapy could enhance the level of toxicity through altered autophagy in tumor cells. The
multikinase inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar, Bayer), used in the treatment of renal and hepatocellular carcinoma,
suppresses tumor angiogenesis and promotes autophagy in tumor cells. We found that sorafenib interacted in a
greater than additive fashion with pemetrexed to increase autophagy and to kill a diverse array of tumor cell
types. Tumor cell types that displayed high levels of cell killing after combination treatment showed elevated
levels of AKT, p70 S6K, and/or phosphorylated mTOR, in addition to class III receptor tyrosine kinases such as
platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta and VEGF receptors, known in vivo targets of sorafenib. In xenograft
and in syngeneic animal models of mammary carcinoma and glioblastoma, the combination of sorafenib and
pemetrexed suppressed tumor growth without deleterious effects on normal tissues or animal body mass. Taken
together, the data suggest that premexetred and sorafenib act synergistically to enhance tumor killing via the
promotion of a toxic form of autophagy that leads to activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, and predict
that combination treatment represents a future therapeutic option in the treatment of solid tumors. Cancer Res;

Introduction
The antifolate drug pemetrexed (ALIMTA, Lilly) was developed as an inhibitor of thymidylate synthase (TS; refs. 1–4).
Pemetrexed also has at least one other target that becomes
apparent from a continued antiproliferative effect of drug
treatment in cell cultures exposed to exogenous thymidine,
which prevents the cytotoxic effects of TS inhibition (1, 2). The
identity of any secondary target(s) for pemetrexed could be of
considerable interest as the drug exhibits clinical responses in
non–small cell lung cancers, which is an unusual activity for

folate antimetabolites (5, 6). Subsequently, the secondary
target was shown to be the folate-dependent enzyme, aminoimidazole-carboxamide ribonucleotide formyl-transferase
(AICART; refs. 1, 2). Pemetrexed inhibition of AICART elevated
the levels of AICAr/R monophosphate (5-aminoimidazole-4carboxamide-1-b-D-ribofuranosyl monophosphate; ZMP), a
substrate of the AICART reaction. Accumulation of ZMP
caused activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
with subsequent inhibition of mTOR and the induction of
autophagy (1, 2).
There are 2 main types of programmed cell death: type I,
also called apoptosis, refers specifically to an ATP energydependent, genetically controlled process involving transcription of specific proteins and leading eventually to a cell's
demise. Propagation of a type I apoptotic signal may occur via
either the extrinsic or the intrinsic pathway (7–9). In the
extrinsic pathway, trimerization of a death receptor, for
example, CD95, recruits and activates caspase 8 via the
death-inducing signaling complex (DISC). DISC formation
and activation of procaspase 8 are suppressed by c-FLIP-l
and c-FLIP-s (9). In some instances, caspase 8 may cleave the
proapoptotic protein BID into its active form, tBID. After
activation, tBID translocates to the mitochondria, where it
contributes to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization,
and cytochrome c and apoptosis inducing factor release
(10, 11). Cytochrome c binds to Apaf-1 that associates with

procaspase 9 and permits procaspase 9 to autocatalyze its
activation. Caspase 9 cleaves to procaspase 3; after cleavage,
caspase 3 translocates to the nucleus, followed by DNA
fragmentation, carried out by DFF40/45. The intrinsic apoptosis pathway comprises the mitochondrial portion of the
extrinsic pathway. After an intracellular insult, BCL-2 proapoptotic family members such as BAK and BAX translocate to
the mitochondria, inactivating the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family
proteins such as BCL-XL and MCL-1 (12, 13). This allows BAX
and BAK to form multimers (pores) which lead to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Inhibition of the intrinsic
apoptosis pathway has previously been shown to suppress
the cytotoxicity of several TS inhibitors, including pemetrexed
(14, 15).
Type II programmed cell death, also called autophagy, is a
ubiquitous process that occurs in all eukaryotes (16, 17).
Autophagy is a nonselective process in which cytoplasm
and organelles are (apparently) randomly assorted into the
autophagosome, where they are degraded. The process is
activated by extracellular and intracellular stimuli (18, 19).
Simplistically, there are 3 types of autophagy: microautophagy,
macroautophagy, and chaperone-mediated autophagy
(20–25). Macroautophagy is mediated by 2 ubiquitin-like
conjugation systems, ATG12–ATG5 and ATG8 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light-chain 3, LC3)-phosphatidyl
ethanolamine (26–30). A green fluorescent protein (GFP)conjugated form of LC3 (ATG8) thus provides a useful tool
for the study of autophagy. After autophagosome formation,
this structure fuses with an acidic endosome. The proteins in
the lumen of this compartment are then degraded.
On the basis of the system and the drugs/stimulus being
studied, autophagy can either act to protect tumor cells from a
toxic stress or can facilitate the toxicity of the stress; we have
published evidence for both protective and toxic forms of
autophagy based on the stimulus and cell type being examined
(31–38). Apoptosis pathways have been linked with autophagy; for example, knockdown of caspase 8 can induce
autophagic death (30). Beclin1 contains a BH3 domain that
binds to BCL-2/BCL-XL/MCL-1, and release of Beclin1 from
these proteins permits induction of autophagy (26–30). The
ser/thr kinase mTOR acts as one gatekeeper in the autophagy
process, exerting an inhibitory effect; mTOR acts both in a
signal transduction cascade that activates antiautophagic
transcription and translation and by inhibiting the ATG
proteins directly via their phosphorylation (39, 40). The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) class I/AKT pathway is involved
in downregulation of autophagy by activation of mTOR,
whereas Beclin1 and the class III-type PI3K complex are
positive regulators of autophagy (41).
Sorafenib [a RAF family kinase inhibitor (Nexavar, Bayer)],
is a multikinase inhibitor that was originally developed as an
inhibitor of RAF-1, a component of the extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway, but which was subsequently shown to inhibit multiple other kinases, including
class III tyrosine kinase receptors such as platelet-derived
growth factor (PDGF), VEGF receptors 1 and 2, c-Kit, and
FLT3 (31–35, and references therein). Antitumor effects of
sorafenib in renal cell carcinoma and in hepatoma have been

4956

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

ascribed to antiangiogenic actions of this agent through
inhibition of the growth factor receptors (31–35, and references therein). However, several groups of investigators,
including ours, have shown in vitro that sorafenib kills human
leukemia cells at concentrations below the maximum achievable dose (Cmax) of 15–20 mmol/L through a mechanism
involving downregulation of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family
member MCL-1. In these studies, sorafenib-mediated MCL-1
downregulation occurred through a translational rather than
a transcriptional or post-translational process that was
mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling and
the regulation of autophagy. More recently, we have shown
that sorafenib-mediated inhibition of PDGF receptor b
(PDGFR-b) plays a key role in the ability of this agent to
promote autophagy in tumor cells (35).
The present studies attempted to define whether pemetrexed toxicity was modified by the drug-induced induction of
autophagy, and whether sorafenib, a drug that also is known
to modulate autophagy, could interact with pemetrexed to kill
tumor cells.

Materials and Methods
Sorafenib tosylate was purchased from Eton Bioscience, Inc.
Pemetrexed was purchased from LC Laboratories. TrypsinEDTA, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), RPMI,
and penicillin–streptomycin were purchased from GIBCOBRL
Life Technologies. All cells, except for primary human GBM
cells and MCF7 and MCF7F, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were not further
validated beyond that claimed by ATCC. Cells were repurchased every 6 months. GBM cells came from the repository at
the Mayo Clinic. MCF7 cells were obtained by Dr. K.P. Nephew
from their primary source (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor,
MI). MCF7F cells were generated as noted in (42). Plasmids to
express active p70 S6K and active mTOR were purchased from
Addgene. Commercially available validated short hairpin RNA
molecules to knockdown RNA/protein levels were from Qiagen. Reagents and performance of experimental procedures
were described in refs. 31–38.
Culture and in vitro exposure of cells to drugs
All cell lines were cultured at 37 C [5% (v/v CO2)] in vitro
using RPMI supplemented with dialyzed 5% (v/v) fetal calf
serum and 10% (v/v) nonessential amino acids. Human serum
does not contain significant amounts of thymidine. If the fetal
calf serum, generally used by many scientists, for in vitro studies
has not been dialyzed to remove the thymidine, experiments
will only obtain, at best, 30% of the combination killing effect
due to a diminution of the actions of pemetrexed (see Supplementary Data). Cells growing in complete fetal calf serum that
contains thymidine were gradually weaned into dialyzed serum
lacking thymidine over 2 weeks and were then used for
experimental analyses for the following 3 weeks before being
discarded (1, 2). Cells were re-isolated in thymidine-less media
as required. For short-term cell killing assays and immunoblotting studies, cells were plated at a density of 3  103 per cm2
(2  105 cells per well of a 12-well plate) and 48 hours after

plating treated with various drugs, as indicated. In vitro pemetrexed and sorafenib treatments were from 100-mmol/L stock
solutions of each drug, and the maximal concentration of
vehicle (DMSO) in media was 0.02% (v/v). Cells were not
cultured in reduced serum media during any study described
in this article.
In vitro cell treatments, microscopy, SDS-PAGE, and
Western blot analysis
For in vitro analyses of short-term cell death effects, cells
were treated with vehicle or pemetrexed/sorafenib for the
indicated times in the legends for Figs. 1–5. For apoptosis
assays where indicated, cells were isolated at the indicated
times, and either subjected to trypan blue cell viability assay
by counting in a light microscope or fixed to slides, and
stained using a commercially available Diff Quick (Geimsa)
assay kit. Alternatively, the Annexin V–propidium iodide (PI)
assay was carried out to determine cell viability as per the
manufacturer's instructions (BD PharMingen) using a Becton
Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Pemetrexed/sorafenib
lethality, as judged by Annexin V–PI, was first evident approximately 12 hours after drug exposure (data not shown).
For SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, cells were plated at
5  105 cells/cm2 and treated with drugs at the indicated
concentrations and after the indicated time of treatment,
lysed in whole-cell lysis buffer (0.5 mol/L Tris-HCl, pH 6.8,
2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% b-mercaptoethanol, and 0.02%
bromophenol blue), and the samples were boiled for 30
minutes. The boiled samples were loaded onto 10%–14%
SDS-PAGE, and electrophoresis was run overnight (10–100
mg/lane based on the gel size). Proteins were electrophoretically transferred onto 0.22-mm nitrocellulose and immunoblotted with various primary antibodies against different
proteins. All immunoblots were visualized using an Odyssey
Infrared imager. For presentation, immunoblots were digitally
assessed using the provided Odyssey Imager software [the
data sets presented are the fold increase  SEM (n ¼ 3) in
expression of the indicated protein compared with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) loading control; for phosphoproteins the fold increase  SEM (at least
n ¼ 3) is normalized to the total protein level of the indicated
kinase or substrate]. Errors are not numerically shown
because of space restrictions in the figures displayed in this
article; any significant differences between the expression/
phosphorylation levels of proteins are indicated by an asterisk
or other annotation (P < 0.05).
Transfection of cells with siRNA or with plasmids
For plasmids, cells were plated as described above and
transfected 24 hours after plating. For mouse embryonic
fibroblasts (2–5 mg) or other cell types (0.5 mg), plasmids
expressing a specific mRNA (or siRNA) or appropriate vector
control plasmid DNA were diluted in 50 mL serum-free and
antibiotic-free medium (1 portion for each sample). Concurrently, 2 mL Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), was diluted into
50 mL of serum-free and antibiotic-free medium (1 portion for
each sample). Diluted DNA was added to the diluted Lipofectamine 2000 for each sample and incubated at room

temperature for 30 minutes. This mixture was added to each
well/dish of cells containing 200 mL serum-free and antibioticfree medium for a total volume of 300 mL, and the cells were
incubated for 4 hours at 37 C. An equal volume of doublestrength medium was then added to each well. Cells were
incubated for 48 hours and then treated with pemetrexed/
sorafenib.
Transfection with siRNA
Cells were plated in 60-mm dishes from a fresh culture
growing in log phase as described above, and transfected 24
hours after plating. Prior to transfection, the medium was
aspirated, and 1 mL serum-free medium was added to each
plate. For transfection, 10 nmol/L of the annealed siRNA, the
positive sense control double-stranded siRNA targeting
GAPDH or the negative control (a scrambled sequence with
no significant homology to any known gene sequences from
mouse, rat, or human cell lines) was used. siRNA (10 nmol/L;
scrambled or experimental) was diluted in serum-free media.
Hiperfect (4 mL; Qiagen) was added to this mixture, and the
solution was mixed by pipetting up and down several times.
This solution was incubated at room temperature for 10
minutes and then added dropwise to each dish. The medium
in each dish was swirled gently to mix and then incubated at
37 C for 2 hours. One microliter of 10% (v/v) serum-containing
medium was added to each plate, and cells were incubated at
37 C for 48 hours before replating (50  103 cells each) onto
12-well plates. Cells were allowed to attach overnight and then
treated with pemetrexed/sorafenib (0–48 hours). Trypan blue
exclusion/terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated
dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)/flow cytometry assays
and SDSPAGE/immunoblotting analyses were conducted at
the indicated time points.
Recombinant adenoviral vectors; infection in vitro
We generated and purchased previously described recombinant adenoviruses to modulate protein expression and to
express constitutively activated and dominant-negative proteins, dominant-negative caspase 9, and BCL-XL (Vector
Biolabs). Cells were infected with these adenoviruses at an
approximate multiplicity of infection of 50. Cells were further
incubated for 24 hours to ensure adequate expression of
transduced gene products prior to drug exposures.
Microscopy for LC3–GFP expression
Cells were transfected with a plasmid to express an LC3–
GFP fusion protein and then were cultured for 24 hours. Cells
were then treated with drugs, as indicated. LC3–GFP transfected cells were visualized at the indicated time points on the
Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) filter.
Animal studies
Animal studies in flank and brain were carried out under
approved protocols by the Virginia Commonwealth University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. For studies
with human mammary carcinoma cells, athymic nu/nu mice
(8-week-old, female) were injected, into the fourth mammary

fat pad, with 1.0  107 BT474 cells. Tumors of approximately
75 mm3 grew over the following month. Animals were segregated into tumor volumes of approximate equivalent
mean tumor size and standard error. The animals were
administered vehicle diluent (Cremophore, BASF), sorafenib
(25 mg/kg), pemetrexed (50 mg/kg), or the drug combination
by oral gavage once every day for 5 days. We carried out the
experiment twice with a total of 10 animals per treatment
group. Tumor volumes were measured every 2 to 3 days as
indicated. For studies with mouse mammary tumor cells,
Balb/c mice (8-week-old, female) were obtained from the
Nathinal Cancer Institute, and animals were injected into
the fourth mammary fat pad with 1.0  107 4T1 cells. Five
days after implantation, the animals were administered vehicle diluent (Cremophore), sorafenib, pemetrexed, or the drug
combination (as above) by oral gavage for 5 days. The volumes
of the tumors in each group were calculated 14 days after the
final drug treatment. We carried out the experiment twice
with a total of 10 animals per treatment group.
For studies using GBM6-luciferase, athymic female were
anesthetized via intraperitoneal administration of ketamine
(40 mg/kg) and xylazine (3 mg/kg) and immobilized in a
stereotactic frame (David Kopf Instruments). A 24-gauge
needle attached to a Hamilton syringe was inserted into
the right basal ganglia to a depth of 3.5 mm and then withdrawn 0.5 mm to make space for tumor cell accumulation. The
entry point at the skull was 2-mm lateral and 1-mm dorsal to
the bregma. Intracerebral injection of 0.5  106 GBM6-luc
glioma cells (40 mice per cell line per separate experiment)
in 2 mL of DMEM was carried out over 10 minutes. The skull
opening was enclosed with sterile bone wax, and the skin
incision was closed using sterile surgical staples. The animals
were administered vehicle diluent (Cremophore), sorafenib
(25 mg/kg), pemetrexed (50 mg/kg), or the drug combination
by oral gavage once every day for 5 days. We carried out the
experiment twice with a total of 12 animals in each treatment
group.
For normal tissue toxicity studies, animals were administered vehicle diluent (cremophore) or with sorafenib (25 mg/
kg) and pemetrexed (50 mg/kg) in combination by oral gavage
once every day for 5 days. Animals were rested for 2 days and
then treated for an additional 5 days with vehicle or drugs.
Two days after cessation of drug treatment, animals were
humanely sacrificed and tissues (brain, lung, liver, heart,
kidney, and spleen) isolated, 10 mmol/L sections taken, and
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained. For immunohistochemistry and staining of fixed tumor sections following sacrifice,
tumors were fixed in optimal cutting temperature compound
(Tissue Tek) and cryostat sectioned (Leica) as 10-mm sections.
Data shown are representative slides from several sections
from the same tumor with multiple tumors (from multiple
animals and multiple experiments) having been examined at
least 3–6 animals  tumors per group).
Data analysis
Comparison of the effects of various treatments was carried
out using ANOVA and Student t-test. Differences with
P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Experiments

Statistical examination of in vivo animal survival data utilized
log-rank statistical analyses between the different treatment
groups.

Results
Mammary, hepatoma, and lung carcinoma cells were grown
in thymidine-less serum to replicate growth conditions of an
in situ tumor in a patient. Cells were treated with low clinically
relevant doses of the antifolate pemetrexed and in response
cells rapidly increased their levels of autophagy as judged by
vesicularization of a GFP tagged form of LC3 (ATG8; LC3–
GFP) and by increased processing of LC3 to LC3II (Fig. 1A;
Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 1, 2). Drug-induced autophagy was
first observed at a higher pemetrexed dose within 6 hours of
treatment, and autophagy was noted at all doses within 12
hours. The induction of autophagy was blocked by a small
molecule inhibitor of the class III PI3K Vps34, 3 methyladenine (3MA), or by knockdown of Beclin1 or ATG5 (data
not shown; Supplementary Fig. S2). Within 24 hours, treatment of breast cancer cells with pemetrexed caused a dosedependent reduction in cell viability as judged by Annexin
V–PI flowcytometry, an effect that was blocked by 3MA or by
knockdown of Beclin1 (Fig. 1B and C).
Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor with biologic actions
that have often been tied to inhibition of class III receptor
tyrosine kinases (RTK), for example, VEGFRs and PDGFR-b
(35). We and others have also noted that sorafenib can
stimulate autophagy through inhibition of class III RTKs,
and that in a dose-dependent effect this response can either
be a protective form of autophagy or a toxic form of autophagy
(e.g., 35, 36). Hence, we next determined whether sorafenib
enhanced, or suppressed, pemetrexed toxicity. Sorafenib and
pemetrexed interacted in a greater than additive fashion to
increase the number of autophagic vesicles in tumor cells that
correlated with increased processing of LC3 to LC3II and that
was inhibited by knockdown of Beclin1 (Fig. 2A). Sorafenib
enhanced the toxicity of pemetrexed in a dose-dependent
fashion in short-term 24-hour cell viability assays using multiple tumor cells from a diverse range of tissue types (Fig. 2B and
C; Supplementary Fig. S3–S7). Knockdown of Beclin1 blocked
the pemetrexed þ sorafenib drug combination–stimulated
induction of autophagy and suppressed the cytotoxic interaction between sorafenib and pemetrexed (Fig. 2A and D;
Supplementary Fig. S8). Incubation of cells with 3MA also
suppressed pemetrexed þ sorafenib–induced toxicity (data
not shown).
It has been noted by Racanelli and colleagues and Rothbart
and colleagues that pemetrexed treatment increases the intracellular concentration of the chemical ZMP resulting in ZMPinduced activation of the AMPK; AMPK activation in turn acts
to suppress mTOR activity (1, 2). Reduced mTOR activity has
been associated with elevated levels of autophagy. Because of
these findings, we investigated whether suppression of mTOR
function by use of rapamycin-altered pemetrexed lethality (1, 2,
39, 40). Rapamycin (Rap) enhanced pemetrexed toxicity
in multiple tumor cell types (Supplementary Fig. S9). Thus

Figure 3. Fulvestrant-resistant MCF7 cells express higher levels of autophagy markers and mitochondrial protective proteins; protection of the mitochondria
blocks pemetrexed þ sorafenib toxicity. A, MCF7 and MCF7F cells, 24 hours after plating, were treated with vehicle (PBS) or pemetrexed (1.0 mmol/L)
and/or vehicle (DMSO) or sorafenib (3.0 mmol/L). Cells were isolated 24 hours after drug exposure and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against
the indicated proteins as described in the Materials and Methods section. The intensity of immunostaining was normalized to either GAPDH for proteins or for
phosphoproteins to the dephosphorylated protein; these values were then arbitrarily normalized with the intensity value for each protein or phosphoprotein
equivalent in vehicle-treated MCF7 cells to 1.00 (n ¼ 3;  SEM; *, P < 0.05 less than corresponding vehicle control value; @, P < 0.05 greater than
corresponding vehicle control value in parental MCF7; #, P < 0.05 greater than corresponding vehicle control value). B, MCF7 and MCF7F cells were infected
with empty vector virus (Ad.cmv); with a virus to express dominant-negative caspase 9 (Ad.dnCasp9); or with viruses to express a BCL-XL or c-FLIP-s (Ad.
BCL-XL; Ad.c-FLIP). Twenty-four hours after infection, cells were treated with vehicle (PBS) or pemetrexed (0.03–3.0 mmol/L) and/or vehicle (DMSO)
or sorafenib. Viability was determined in triplicate 48 hours later by trypan blue exclusion (n ¼ 2;  SEM; *, P < 0.05 less than corresponding vehicle

chronically treated with tamoxifen, has frequently been
observed. For ERþ postmenopausal breast cancer patients,
the development of other "purer" antiestrogen therapeutics
such as fulvestrant has also been beneficial though even
these purer antiestrogen modalities have potential to fail with
the delayed outgrowth of estrogen-independent breast
cancer cells (43). We next determined the impact of fulvestrant resistance on the lethality of the pemetrexed þ sorafenib
drug combination in a well-characterized ERþ breast cancer
cell line that had been isolated from a pleural effusion,
MCF7.

In agreement with a role for autophagy in the regulation of
mammary tumor cell survival following sorafenib þ pemetrexed, in parental MCF7, and fulvestrant-resistant MCF7
cells (MCF7F), sorafenib or the drug combination increased
LC3II processing and decreased p62 levels (Fig. 3A). Parental
MCF7 cells are known to be haplotype for expression of
the autophagy regulatory gene Beclin1, and it has been
postulated in clinical samples from breast cancer and lung
cancer patients that loss of Beclin1 facilitates mammary/lung
tumorigenesis (e.g., 43). Basal Beclin1 levels were significantly
elevated in MCF7F compared with parental MCF7 cells;

Pemetrexed and Sorafenib

similar findings were also noted for ATG5–ATG12 levels. In
parental MCF7 cells, drug combination treatment increased
Beclin1 and ATG5–ATG12 expression to approximately the
same extent as the basal protein levels in MCF7F cells
(Fig. 3A). Beclin1 and ATG5–ATG12 levels were not further
enhanced by the drug treatment in MCF7F cells.
In addition to altering expression of autophagy regulatory
proteins, drug combination exposure of MCF7 and MCF7F
cells also reduced expression of the mitochondrial protective
proteins MCL-1 and BCL-XL (Fig. 3B); these are proteins we
have previously implicated in breast cancer cells to sequester
Beclin1 and reduce the ability of tumor cells to induce
autophagy, as well as to suppress apoptosis. Overexpression
of BCL-XL or expression of dominant-negative caspase 9, but
not the expression of c-FLIP-s, significantly suppressed drug
combination cytotoxicity, implying that autophagy was feeding in to the intrinsic apoptosis pathway at the level of the
mitochondrion and that the extrinsic pathway was not
involved in killing (Fig. 3B).
On the basis of our in vitro cell survival data and expression
data for autophagy regulatory proteins, we next examined the
relative phosphorylation and expression levels of signal transduction proteins after pemetrexed þ sorafenib treatment;
expression and activity of these proteins have been associated
by others and ourselves in a variety of systems to correlate to
altered levels of autophagy and apoptosis. Tumor cell types
that displayed high levels of cell killing after pemetrexed þ
sorafenib exposure, such as MCF7F, H460, and HuH7, tended
to exhibit significantly elevated basal levels of AKT, p70 S6K,
and/or mTOR phosphorylation (Fig. 4A; Supplementary
Fig. S10). Cells that were more sensitive to the pemetrexed
þ sorafenib drug combination, such as MCF7F and HuH7, also
tended to display elevated expression levels of class III RTKs
such as PDGFR-b and VEGFR1, known in vivo targets
of sorafenib. Thus, based on these findings, and those in
Fig. 2C with estrogen-dependent and fulvestrant-resistant
MCF7 cells, we further explored the signaling responses
and viability changes of tumor cells after pemetrexed þ
sorafenib treatment.
We found that fulvestrant-resistant MCF7 breast cancer
cells (MCF7F) overexpressed the class III RTK PDGFR-b, had
elevated levels of ERK1/2, p70 S6K, and mTOR activity, and

were more sensitive to drug combination toxicity compared
with their estrogen-dependent counterparts (Figs. 2C, 4A
and B). Treatment of parental MCF7 cells with pemetrexed
and sorafenib, but not the individual drugs, modestly suppressed T421/S424 and mTOR S2448 phosphorylation and
strongly increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Treatment of MCF7F cells with pemetrexed more effectively
reduced p70 S6K T421/S424 phosphorylation than sorafenib,
and sorafenib more effectively reduced p70 S6K T389 and
mTOR S2448 phosphorylation than pemetrexed. Knockdown
of PDGFR-b, or of p70 S6K or mTOR enhanced pemetrexed
and pemetrexed þ sorafenib lethality (Fig. 4C and D). Thus, for
PDGFRb, the observed elevated receptor expression and
elevated drug toxicity in MCF7F cells define this protein as
one molecular marker for a tumor cell response to the
sorafenib and pemetrexed drug combination. Because sorafenib and pemetrexed treatment reduced p70 S6K and mTOR
activity, we hypothesized that expression of constitutively
activated forms of p70 S6K and mTOR would reduce drug
cytotoxicity. Expression of a constitutively active form of p70
S6K and of mTOR significantly reduced the toxic effects of
pemetrexed and sorafenib treatment (Fig. 4E).
All the prior studies cited in this article have been using 2dimensional in vitro cultures of tumor cells. Because our
ultimate goal is to translate the pemetrexed þ sorafenib drug
combination into the clinic, we determined whether sorafenib
and pemetrexed interacted in vivo to suppress tumor cell
growth in various tumor model systems. In orthotopic established HER2-positive BT474 human mammary carcinoma
tumors growing in the fourth mammary fat pad, sorafenib
significantly reduced tumor growth whereas pemetrexed had
little impact on tumor mass (Fig. 5A). Combined exposure to
sorafenib and pemetrexed significantly reduced tumor growth
below that of sorafenib treatment alone and almost abolished
tumor growth. The alterations in tumor growth data correlated in sections of the respective tumors with increased
cleavage of procaspase 3 and TUNEL staining, a reduction
in proliferation (Ki67), and a manifest disruption of tumor
cytoarchitecture (Fig. 5B).
In the spontaneous mouse mammary tumor cell line 4T1,
which is HER1 dependent for growth, we noted in tumors
growing in the fourth mammary fat pad that sorafenib and

greater than value in parental MCF7). B, MCF7 and MCF7F cells, 24 hours after plating, were treated with vehicle (PBS) or pemetrexed (1.0 mmol/L) and/or
vehicle (DMSO) or sorafenib (3.0 mmol/L). Cells were isolated 24 hours after drug exposure and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting against
the indicated proteins as described in the Materials and Methods section. The intensity of immunostaining was normalized to either GAPDH for proteins or for
phosphoproteins to the dephosphorylated protein; these values were then arbitrarily normalized with the intensity value for each protein or phosphoprotein
equivalent in vehicle-treated MCF7 cells to 1.00 (n ¼ 3;  SEM; *, P < 0.05 less than corresponding vehicle control value; @, P < 0.05 greater than
corresponding vehicle control value in parental MCF7; #, P < 0.05 greater than corresponding vehicle control value). C, MCF7 and MCF7F cells were
transfected in triplicate with siRNAs (si-scramble, siSCR; PDGFRb; 20 nmol/L). Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were treated with vehicle (PBS) or
pemetrexed (0.1–1.0 mmol/L). Viability was determined in triplicate 48 hours later by trypan blue exclusion (n ¼ 2;  SEM; {, P < 0.05 greater than
corresponding siSCR value). Upper immunoblots: siRNA transfected cells were treated with drugs and isolated 12 hours after drug treatment and
immunoblotting carried out for levels of SRC Y416 and PDGFR-b. D, MCF7 and MCF7F cells were transfected with siRNAs (si-scramble, siSCR; si-mTOR;
si-p70 S6K; 20 nmol/L). Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were treated with vehicle (PBS) or pemetrexed (0.1–1.0 mmol/L). Viability was determined in

Figure 5. Pemetrexed (PTX) and sorafenib (Sor) interact to suppress breast
cancer tumor growth in orthotopic human and rodent syngeneic model
systems. A, BT474 tumors were established in the fourth mammary fat pad
of athymic mice (75 mm3). Animals were treated with vehicle, sorafenib,
pemetrexed, or both drugs simultaneously as described in the Materials and
Methods section. Animals were treated for 5 days with drugs and tumor
volumes measured every 2–3 days as indicated, and mean tumor volumes
plotted (2 studies; 8 animals per group total  SEM; *, P < 0.05 less than
corresponding vehicle control value; %, P < 0.05 less than corresponding
sorafenib value). B, BT474 tumors 14 days after drug exposure were fixed,
sectioned, and stained as described in the Materials and Methods section.
Ki67 measures tumor cell proliferative rate; TUNEL and cleaved caspase
3 the levels of tumor cell apoptosis within the tumors. C, 4T1 tumors were
injected into the fourth mammary fat pad of BALB/c mice. Five days after
implantation, the animals were administered vehicle, sorafenib, pemetrexed,
or both drugs simultaneously (as described in the Materials and Methods
section) for 5 days. The volumes of the tumors in each group were calculated
14 days after the final drug treatment (2 studies; 8 animals per group total
 SEM; *, P < 0.05 less than pemetrexed- or sorafenib-treated tumor values).

pemetrexed also interacted to suppress tumor growth
(Fig. 5C). Our in vivo data using 4T1 cells were in agreement
with in vitro apoptosis data shown in Supplementary Fig. S5
In an orthotopic model of human GBM, in a primary GBM
tumor cell isolate that displays invasive capabilities compared with commercially available established cell lines, that
is, GBM6-luc that expresses EGFR VIII, we noted that
treatment with pemetrexed þ sorafenib significantly suppressed tumor cell growth during and shortly after drug
exposure (Supplementary Fig. S11; P < 0.05). Many days after
drug exposure, tumors still exhibited a high level of apoptosis (Supplementary Fig. S12). Finally, because we wish to
move our drug combination into the clinic, consideration of
normal tissue toxicity effects needed to be made. Thus, we
determined whether combined sorafenib and pemetrexed
treatment had any deleterious effects on normal mouse
tissues. Pemetrexed þ sorafenib treatment did not reduce
the body mass of animals carrying GBM6-luc, BT474 tumors
or in animals lacking tumors (Supplementary Figs. S13–S15).
Two weeks of pemetrexed þ sorafenib treatment did not
result in any obvious normal tissue toxicity as judged using
H&E staining of sectioned organs and examination of
nuclear morphology (apoptosis) or of tissue integrity (Supplementary Figs. S16–S18).

Cancer Res; 71(14) July 15, 2011

The antifolate pemetrexed was recently shown to elevate
ZMP levels, thereby activating AMPK, which in turn caused
inactivation of mTOR and increased levels of autophagy
within a tumor cell (1, 2). The precise role of autophagy in
survival or death within these studies was not investigated.
The mTOR pathway is, in part, responsible for regulating
energy metabolism, and a number of tumor suppressor proteins play a central role in fine-tuning the activity of this
pathway, including PI3K, PTEN, LKB1, AMPK, and mTORC1.
The present studies sought to understand the role of autophagy in response of tumor cells to pemetrexed and to
understand how the levels of autophagy and ER stress caused
by pemetrexed could be manipulated to cause additional
tumor cell killing, that is, by combined treatment with the
multi-RTK inhibitor sorafenib.
In a genetically diverse group of tumor cells from a wide
range of malignancies, we found that pemetrexed caused a
toxic form of autophagy, as judged using 3MA and Beclin1
knockdown. The multikinase inhibitor sorafenib inhibited
PDGFR-b and knockdown of PDGFR-b or sorafenib treatment
of cells further promoted pemetrexed-induced autophagy that
was involved in the additional levels of tumor cell killing
caused by the drug combination. The drug combination
exhibited elevated antitumor effects in vivo compared with
the individual agents in several animal orthotopic model
systems of breast cancer and also in an orthotopic model
of invasive primary human glioblastoma.
As previously published by this laboratory and other groups,
autophagy can be shown either to protect cells from a toxic
stress or to facilitate the toxicity of the stress, all of which
seems to be based on the stimulus and the tumor cell type

Pemetrexed and Sorafenib

being examined (31–38). In the majority of cells, the single
agent toxicity of pemetrexed was dependent on autophagy.
More significantly, however, for the future translational development of this drug combination, in at least 1 tumor cell type,
the HCT116 and DLD1 colorectal carcinoma lines, we noted
that pemetrexed-induced autophagy was a weakly protective
response to single agent lethality; nonetheless, sorafenib also
potentiated pemetrexed-induced autophagy and cell killing in
these tumor cells in a manner consistent with the other cell
lines/types examined in the majority of our studies (Park,
Bareford, Moran, and Dent; unpublished data).
Pemetrexed and sorafenib treatment caused inactivation of
the p70 S6K and mTOR protein kinases, as judged by their
dephosphorylation at multiple regulatory sites. Of note,
though, was that the protein kinases believed to phosphorylate
these particular sites in p70 S6K and mTOR either exhibited
little change in their phosphorylation/activity (i.e., AKT) or
paradoxically displayed elevated activity (i.e., ERK1/2). In this
regard, it has been shown that p70 S6K and mTOR inactivation
and ERK1/2 activation have all been linked to enhanced
autophagy levels (45–50). Expression of activated forms of
p70 S6K and mTOR significantly reduced the toxicity of sorafenib and pemetrexed exposure. Collectively our data lead us
to conclude that sustained inhibition of the p70 S6K/mTOR
signaling module following sorafenib þ pemetrexed exposure
plays a central role in drug combination lethality. Whether the
altered p70 S6K activity in our system also results in differential
translation of terminal oligopyrimidine tracts in 50 untranslated region (50 -TOP) mRNAs, molecules which have recently
been linked to increased autophagy, will require additional
detailed experimentation (51).
Apoptosis and autophagy pathways are intimately intertwined processes. On the basis of a literature search, the
primary pathway of pemetrexed-induced cell killing has been
postulated to occur via the intrinsic pathway, although there is
relatively little information in the literature, and tested with
molecular tools, to completely prove this assertion (1, 2, 52).
There are several mechanisms by which endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, and apoptosis can interact to alter cell
viability, most notably through PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum (PERK)-dependent inhibition of translation, thereby reducing levels of protective proteins with short half-lives such as
MCL-1 through altering the sequestration of Beclin1 via its BH3
domain with several protective BCL-2 family proteins (BCL-2,
BCL-XL, and MCL-1) and by cleavage and activation of BID
with lysosomal proteases such as cathepsins and calpains (53,
54). Sorafenib þ pemetrexed treatment reduced both MCL-1
and BCL-XL protein levels, which would lead to both reduced
levels of protective proteins permitting activation of toxic BH3
domain proteins such as BAX and BAK, as well as causing
greater levels of unsequestered Beclin1. In other studies, we
have recently shown that drug-induced release of Beclin1 from
MCL-1 using the MCL-1 inhibitor Obatoclax (Cephalon) facilitates the binding of Beclin1 to the class III PI3K vps34, thereby
promoting autophagy, an effect that has been shown to either
preserve or diminish cell viability based on the stimulus and
cell type being examined (31–38). Increased formation of acidic
lysosomes, as the final end product of autophagic flux, have

www.aacrjournals.org

potential to lead to release of active cathepsin and calpain
proteases into the cytosol, where proapoptotic proteins such as
BID can then be cleaved/activated (37). Other groups using a
diverse variety of stimuli have observed similar lysosomal
protease-dependent events (53–55). Beclin1 and ATG5 have
potential to be cleaved by cysteine proteases, resulting in
metabolized proteins that no longer promote autophagy but
instead facilitate activation of other toxic BH3 domain proteins
leading to pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane, causing release of cytochrome c with resultant activation of procaspase 9 and induction of apoptosis (56). At present,
we do not precisely know, following pemetrexed þ sorafenib
treatment, how high levels of autophagy at the molecular level
facilitate mitochondria-dependent apoptosis. These questions
await detailed examination in a subsequent study.
It is well known that MCF7 cells, and many primary breast
cancers, have a haplotype insufficiency in Beclin1 and thus are
less effective at inducing autophagy than are nontransformed
mammary epithelial cells (57). These findings would suggest
that loss of autophagy in breast cancer facilitates tumor
formation. We noted that MCF7F cells expressed higher basal
levels of Beclin1, as well as of ATG5–ATG12, compared with
parental MCF7 cells arguing that a portion of the process by
which MCF7 cells maintain their viability in the face of estrogen
deprivation/loss of ER signaling is because of an increased
ability to induce a protective form of autophagy. In agreement
with this finding, agents that act to suppress the later lysosomal
fusion stage of autophagy, for example, chloroquine, can
facilitate the antitumor effects of the antiestrogen tamoxifen
(58). We noted that MCF7F cells were more susceptible to
pemetrexed þ sorafenib lethality—a lethality that was dependent on a toxic form of autophagy. At least 1 key molecular
marker for the enhanced response in MCF7F cells to sorafenib
was because of their having overexpression of PDGFR-b compared with parental MCF7 cells. Collectively, our data argue
that the initial autophagic survival response of breast cancer
cells following antiestrogen therapy, which selects for tumor
cells that overexpress Beclin1, may subsequently facilitate
tumor cell killing by drug combinations that utilize toxic forms
of autophagy to achieve their therapeutic effects (59).
In several orthotopic models of breast cancer, we showed
that pemetrexed and sorafenib interacted to suppress tumor
growth that correlated with increased levels of apoptosis
within the tumor. Using invasive primary human GBM cells
that express an oncogene associated with shorter patient
survival, EGFR VIII, we also observed a significant reduction
in tumor growth and prolongation of survival. In the clinic,
sorafenib is approved for treatment of renal and hepatocellular carcinomas and is believed to act by suppressing tumor
angiogenesis, that is, through inhibition of VEGFR family
receptors. Pemetrexed is approved for treatment and maintenance therapy of non–small cell lung cancer and mesothelioma. On the basis of the data presented in this article, we are
preparing to develop and implement a protocol for an openlabel phase I trial combining sorafenib and pemetrexed in
patients with recurrent solid tumors. That study should open
at Virginia Commonwealth University Massey Cancer Center
by fall of 2011.
