ABSTRACT
Though tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) has been
used as a potent anticancer agent, TRAIL resistance is a hot-issue in cancer therapy.
We investigated the antitumor mechanism of Tanshinone I to sensitize prostate
cancer cells to TRAIL. Comibination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL exerted synergistic
cytotoxicity, increased cleaved PARP, sub G1 population, the number of TUNEL
positive cells, activated caspase 8, 9 and ROS production in PC-3 and DU145 cells.
Of note, combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL enhanced the protein expression of
death receptor 5 (DR5) and attenuated anti-apoptotic proteins. RT-PCR and RT-qPCR
analyses confirmed that co-treatment of Tanshinone I and TRAIL up-regulated DR5
and microRNA 135a-3p at mRNA level or activity of DR5 promoter and attenuated
phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases in PC-3. Conversely, the
silencing of DR5 blocked the increased cytotoxicity, sub G1 population and PARP
cleavages induced by co-treatment of Tanshinone I and TRAIL. Interestingly, miR135a3p mimic enhanced DR5 at mRNA, increased PARP cleavage, Bax and the number of
TUNEL positive cells in Tanshinone I and TRAIL cotreated PC-3. Overall, our findings
suggest that Tanshinone I enhances TRAIL mediated apoptosis via upregulation of
miR135a-3p mediated DR5 in prostate cancer cells as a potent TRAIL sensitizer.

INTRODUCTION

accumulating evidences that TRAIL resulted in cell death
in various cancer cell types such as colon, [6] ovarian
[7] or hepatocellular carcinoma cells [8] as a selective
anticancer agent.
MicroRNAs, small noncoding RNAs, play critical
roles in oncogene, tumor suppressor, or apoptosis via
inhibition of translation or degradation of target molecules.
Recent studies showed that microRNAs modulate TRAIL
induced apoptosis in cancer cells such as breast cancer or
ovarian cancer [9, 10].
Cryptotanshinone, Tanshinone I, and Tanshinone
IIA were known as the three major bioactive compounds
from Dansen, the dried roots of the medicinal plant
Salvia miltiorrhiza [11] that has been traditionally
used for treating cardiovascular diseases [12]. Recent
study reported that Salvia militiorrhiza with TRAIL

Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers
in men worldwide [1]. Most prostate cancer related deaths
result from cancer metastasis, the spread of cancer from
the prostate to other organs, bones and lymph nodes [2].
Though anti-cancer drugs such as Eulexin, Flutamide
and Nilandron have been used for treatment of prostate
cancer, their side effects have still occurred. Recent
studies reported that TRAIL and microRNA (miR)s were
suggested as potential biomarker or therapeutic potential
in prostate cancer cells [3].
TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
(Apo2 ligand [Apo2L]) that is a member of TNF
superfamily was known to induce two death receptor
DR4 (TRAIL-R1) and DR5 (TRAIL-R2) [4, 5]. There are

showed evident cytotoxicity against the human
lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and ovarian
adenocarcinoma cell line [13].Though Tanshinone I was
shown to exert anti-cancer effects in non-small lung
cancer [14], and breast cancer cells [15], its anti-tumor
mechanism was not fully understood in prostate cancer
cells.
MicroRNAs are regulated in prostate cancer and are
expressed between androgen-dependent and androgenindependent metastatic prostate cancer cells [16, 17].
MiR135a is downregulated in androgene-dependent versus
androgene-independent prostate cancer cells [18]. Though
miR-135a functions in a tumor suppressor in several
cancer cells such as renal cell carcinoma [19] or glioma
cell [20], it has not fully investigated in prostate cancer
cells. Thus, in the present study, the underlying apoptotic
mechanism by combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
was studied mainly in highly aggressive DU145 and PC-3
prostate cancer cells in association with upregulation of
death receptors and microRNA 135a-3p.

Combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
dramatically induced apoptosis in prostate cancer
cells

RESULTS

Combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
activated PARP and caspase 8, regulated the Bcl2 family proteins and increased the level of ROS
in PC-3 and DU145 cells.

To determine whether the cytotoxicity by cotreatment of Tanshinone I and TRAIL was due to
apoptosis induction, FACS analysis and TUNEL assay
were carried out in PC-3 or DU145 cells. As shown in Fig
1C, the co-treatment of Tanshinone I and TRAIL increased
the population of sub-G1 DNA contents compared to
Tanshinone I or TRAIL alone in PC-3 cells. Similarly,
the co-treatment of Tanshinone I or TRAIL in DU145
cells increased the population of sub-G1 DNA contents in
PC-3 and DU145 cells (Fig 1C) by FACS analysis which
was similarly obtained by TUNEL assay (Fig 2A or B).
The numbers of TUNEL positive cells were significantly
increased by combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL in
both PC-3 and DU145 cells compared to Tanshinone I or
TRAIL alone (Fig 2 A and B).

Tanshinone I and TRAIL synergistically enhanced
the cytotoxic effect in prostate cancer cells

Apoptosis is induced through cell death extrinsic
pathway or through mitochondrial dependent intrinsic
pathway[23]. Western blotting assay showed that
combination of Tanshinone I (0, 20, 40 μM) and
TRAIL (25 ng) activated caspase 8, caspase 9, caspase
3 and cleaved PARP in PC-3 or DU145 cells (Fig 2C).
Furthermore, combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
suppressed the expression of pro-survival genes such
as Bcl-XL and Bcl-2 (Fig 2C) and also attenuated
phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinases
(ERK), but did not affect p-AKT in PC-3 cells (Fig 2D). In
addition, ROS level was determined in PC-3 and DU 145
cells by combination of TRAIL and/or Tanshinone I by
fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) methods. As
shown in Fig 2E, Tanshinone I and TRAIL combination
increased the level of ROS in PC-3 and DU 145 cells.

To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of Tanshinone I or
TRAIL, MTT assay was carried out in human prostate
cancer cell lines such as PC-3, DU145 or M2182 cells. To
examine the synergistic cytotoxic activity of Tanshinone
I and TRAIL, various concentrations of Tanshinone I (0,
20, 40, 80 μM), and/ or TRAIL (0, 25, 50 ng) were treated
for 24 h in three prostate cancer cells. As shown in Fig 1A,
combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL synergistically
exerted the cytotoxicity in three all prostate cancer cells.
However, though M2182 cells were more susceptible to
combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL than PC-3 and
DU145 cells, we performed further mechanistic study
mainly in PC-3 and DU145 cells, based on previous
evidences[21, 22] that PC-3 and DU145 cells were known
to be more aggressive and chemoresistant to TRAIL.
The significant synergy by combination of Tanshinone
I and TRAIL was confirmed in PC-3 cells by using
Chou and Talalay equation method, since combination
of Tanshinone I and TRAIL (20 ng) showed significant
combination Index (CI) values, 0.053 and 0.085 below 1
at the concentrations of 40 and 80 μM of Tanshinone I,
respectively (Figure 1B).

Combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
upregulated DR5 in PC-3 cells
To understand the apoptotic mechanism of
Tanshinone I and TRAIL induced apoptosis, the effect
of Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL on the expression of
death receptor-related genes such as DR5 or DR4 was
evaluated in PC-3 or DU145 cells. As shown in Fig 3A,
western blotting showed that combination of Tanshinone
I and TRAIL enhanced the expression of DR5 at protein
level in PC-3 or DU145 cells, but not DR4. Consistently,
combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL increased the

mRNA expression of DR5 by RT-PCR (Fig 3B) or RTqPCR (Fig 3C) in PC-3 or DU145 cells. To confirm
the effect of Tanshinone I and TRAIL on DR5 gene
expression, luciferase gene assay was performed. PC-3
cells were transfected with pDR5/-605 promoter and then
treated with Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL. Combination
of TRAIL and Tanshinone I increased DR5 promoter
activity compared to untreated control or TRAIL alone
(Fig 3D). Furthermore, FACS analysis for the cell surface
expression of DR5 showed that cell surface expression of
DR5 was much more detected in Tanshinone I and TRAIL
treated PC-3 cells compared to untreated control (Fig 3E).

control or DR5 siRNA plasmids transfected PC-3 cells
were treated with Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL. As shown
in Fig 4A, silencing of DR5 suppressed cytotoxicity
induced by combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL,
while combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL exerted
dose dependent cytotoxicity in control vector treated PC-3
cells by MTT assay (Fig 4A). Similarly, silencing of DR5
attenuated the cleavage of PARP (Fig 4B) and also reduced
sub G1 population up to 20.1% from apoptotic portion
(45.2%) exerted (Fig 4C) by combination of Tanshinone I
and TRAIL in PC-3 cells.

miR135a for TRAIL combination study among many
microRNAs, since bioinformatics analysis through
microRNA.org predicted that the binding site of miR135a
was at the 3’-UTR of DR5 mRNA. In the current study,
we checked whether miR135a-3p mediates apoptosis
induced by combination of TRAIL and Tanshinone I
in PC-3 cells. Here, the expression of miR135a-3p was
upregulated by combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
in PC-3 cells (Fig 5A). Furthermore, overexpression of
miR135a-3p enhanced upregulation of DR5 at mRNA or
protein level by RT-qPCR (Fig 5B), RT-PCR and Western

DISCUSSION

was transfected into PC-3 and DU145 cells and also
exposed to Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL. As shown in
Fig 6A, miR135a-3p mimic enhanced cytotoxicity by
combination with Tanshinone I and TRAIL in PC-3 or
DU145 cells compared to Tanshinone I or TRAIL alone.
Likewise, we also confirmed that miR135a-3p mimic
promoted sub G1 accumulation (34.07 %) induced by
combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL in PC-3 cells
compared to Tanshinone I and TRAIL cotreated control
(26.52 %), while miR135a-3p inhibitor decreased sub G1
accumulation to 20.36 % (Fig 6B). Also, as shown in Fig
6C, TUNEL assay showed that the numbers of TUNEL
positive cells were increased in Tanshinone I and TRAIL
cotreated PC-3 cells by miR135a-3p mimic transfection.
Consistently, Western blotting revealed that cleaved PARP
and BAX by combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
were enhanced in miR135a-3p mimic transfected PC-3
cells (Fig 6D).

Though TRAIL has been considered as a potent
anticancer agent in several cancers such as colon [6],
prostate [26-28], breast [29, 30], bladder and kidney
cancers [31, 32], its resistance during cancer therapy
is a hot issue to overcome. Thus, recently several
natural compounds such as quercetin [33], curcumin
[34], artepillin C [35], azadirone [36], emetine [37],
crytotanshinone [38] and salirasib [39] are attractive as
TRAIL sensitizers in many cancers. In the current study,
we provide evidences that Tanshinone I sensitizes the
prostate cancer cells to TRAIL induced apoptosis via
upregulation of miR 135a-3p mediated DR5.
Combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL showed
synergistic cytotoxicity in PC-3, DU145 and M2182
prostate cancer cells compared to Tanshinone I or TRAIL
alone, indicating the potential of Tanshinone I as a TRAIL
sensitizer. Also, combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL

cleaved PARP, activated caspase 8/9, and increased sub
G1 population and the number of TUNEL positive cells as
apoptotic features in PC-3 and DU145 cells, implying that
the cytotoxicity of Tanshinone I and TRAIL was induced
by apoptosis induction via caspase activation and sub G1
apoptotic portion accumulation.
It is well known that apoptosis is induced via
two typical apoptotic pathways such as mitochondrial
dependent intrinsic pathway and cell death receptor
dependent extrinsic pathway in cancers [40-42]. Also,
there are accumulating evidences that overexpression of
cell survival or anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2, and
Bcl-xL contributes to TRAIL resistance in cancer cells
[43] and TRAIL induces apoptosis by binding to its cell
surface death receptors such as DR4 and DR5 [44]. In this
regard, our western blotting showed that combination of
Tanshinone I and TRAIL attenuated the anti-apoptotic
proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and also activated caspase
8, 9 and DR5 in PC-3 and DU145 cells. We also confirmed
the upregulation of DR5 in PC-3 cells by combination of

Tanshinone I and TRAIL by promoter assay and FACS
analysis for cell surface DR5 expression, demonstrating
that Tanshinone I can sensitize prostate cancer cells to
TRAIL induced apoptosis via upregulation of DR5 and
suppression of survival genes. Conversely, the silencing
of DR5 blocked the increased cytotoxicity and sub G1
population and PARP cleavages induced by co-treatment
of Tanshinone I and TRAIL in PC-3 cells.
It is well documented that TRAIL induces apoptosis
via microRNA regulation [45] including miR34a/ [46]
or miR-494 [47] in cancer cells. Thus, Farooqi et al [3]
suggested that miRNA regulation of TRAIL-mediated
signaling in prostate cancer cells can provide potential
biomarkers for the characterization of patients as
responders and non-responders for TRAIL-based therapy.
Recently, miR-135a was also reported to inhibit the
proliferation of renal carcinoma [19], induce apoptosis
in gastric cancer cells [48] and promote drug sensitivity
in cancer cells[49]. Our RT-PCR and RT-qPCR analyses
confirmed that combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL
up-regulated miR135a-3p and DR5 at mRNA level or
activity of DR5 promoter in PC-3 cells, indicating the
possible involvement of miR135a-3p along with DR5
upregulation in antitumor activity of Tanshinone I and
TRAIL in PC-3 cells.
Of note, overexpression of miR135a-3p using its
mimic plasmids enhanced the ability of Tanshinone I and
TRAIL combination to promote cytotoxicity, upregulate
DR5 at mRNA, cleaved PARP and increase the number of
TUNEL positive cells in PC-3 cells compared to untreated
control, implying that miR135a-3p plays a pivotal role
in apoptotic activity by combination of Tanshinone I and
TRAIL in PC-3 and DU145 cells.
Collectively, our results demonstrate that
combination of Tanshinone I and TRAIL synergistically
induce apoptosis via upregulation of miR135a-3p and DR5
in prostate cancer cells and overexpression of miR135a3p enhances upregulation of DR5 leading to cell death by
combined treatment of TRAIL and Tanshinone I. Thus,
our findings suggest that Tanshinone I can be used as a
potent sensitizer for TRAIL-based combination therapy in
prostate cancer cells.

The cytotoxic effect of Tanshinone I and/or
TRAIL against PC-3 , M2182, or DU145 cells was
evaluated by using 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. Briefly, prostate cancer cells were seeded onto
96-well microplate and treated with various concentrations
of Tanshinone I (0, 20, 40 or 80 μM) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) and/or TRAIL (25 or 50 ng) (Sigma, St. Louis,
MO, USA) for 24 h. MTT solution (5 mg/ml) was added
and formazan was dissolved with MTT lysis solution
(20% SDS and 50% dimethylformamide). To measure
the optical density, microplate reader (TECAN, Austria)
at 450 nm was used. Cell viability was determined as a
percentage of viable cells in Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL
treated group versus untreated control.

Cell cycle analysis
PC-3 or DU145 cells were treated with Tanshinone
I and/or TRAIL for 24 h and fixed in 75% ethanol. Fixed
cells were resuspended in PBS containing RNase A (1 mg/
ml), and incubated for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, fixed
cells were stained with propidium iodide (50 µg/ml) for
30 min at room temperature in dark for sub G1 population
and also for early and late apoptosis, Annexin-V FITC/
propidium iodide double staining was performed
according to the manufacturer’s instruction. To analyze
the DNA contents of the stained cells, CellQuest Software
with the FACSCalibur flow cytometry was used (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Western blot analysis
PC-3 or DU145 cells treated by TRAIL and/or
Tanshinone I were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM TrisHCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.25% sodium
deoxycholic acid, 1 M EDTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1mM NaF
and protease inhibitors cocktail). To quantify protein
samples, Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit II (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, CA, USA) was used. Proteins samples were
separated by electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE gel and
electrotransferred onto a Hybond ECL transfer membrane
(Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ, USA). After
blocking, the membrane was incubated with primary
antibodies for PARP,caspase8, caspase 9, AKT, p-AKT,
ERK, pERK, cleaved caspase 3, Bcl-XL, Bcl 2, Bax,
DR5 and beta actin (Cell signaling, Beverly, MA,USA)
followed by exposing to horseradish peroxidase (HRP)conjugated secondary anti-mouse or rabbit antibodies
(AbD serotec, kidlington, UK). To visualize protein bands,
chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia,
Piscataway, NJ, USA) was used.

TUNEL Assay
To detect cell death, the DeadEndTM Fluorometric
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTPbiotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) system kit was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO, USA). In brief, DU145 or PC-3 cells
treated with Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL for 24 h
were washed with cold PBS. Cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 30 min and washed twice with
PBS for 2 min. Fixed cells in permeabilization solution
(0.1%Triton X-100 and 0.1% Sodium citrate) were washed
and incubated with TUNEL assay mixture for 60 min. The
TUNEL-stained cells were visualized by a FLUOVIEW
FV10i confocal microscopy (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).

Short interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection assay
PC-3 cells were transiently transfected with control
siRNA, or DR5 siRNA (Bioneer, Korea) by using
InterferinTM transfection reagent (Polyplus-transfection
Inc., New York, NY). Briefly, the mixture of DR5
siRNA (40 nM) and InterferinTM transfection reagent
was incubated for 10 min, and added to the cells. The
cells were incubated at 37°C for 48 h and treated with
Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL or for 24 h.

RT-PCR and RT-qPCR analyses
Total RNA from prostate cells was isolated using
the QIAzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and one

Combination Index (CI) Calculation

pDR5/-605 promoter construct (gifted from Dr. TK
Kwon, Keimyung University, Korea) was transfected into
PC-3 cells along with Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid.
After 24 h transfection, the cells were treated with
Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL for 24 h. Luciferase activity
was measured using Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).

The combination index was performed by ChouTalalay method and CalcuSyn software (Biosoft,
Ferguson, MO, USA). A combination index CI < 1 was
considered synergistic [50].

FACS analysis for cell surface expression of DR5

Statistical analyses of the data were conducted
using Sigmaplot version 12 software (Systat Software
Inc., San Jose, CA). All data were expressed as means
± standard error of the mean (SEM). The statistically
significant differences between control and treatments
were calculated by the Student’s t-test and one-way
ANOVA test .

Statistical analyses

To determine the surface expression of the DR5,
FACS analysis was carried out. PC-3 cells treated with
Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL for 24 h were twice washed
with PBS and incubated with 10 μg/ml DR5-FITC
conjugated or mouse IgG antibody (Abcam, United
Kingdom) in PBS for 1 h at 4°C. After washing, cells were
analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACS Calibur flow
cytometer (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).

Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

PC-3 or DU145 cells were cultured and then preincubated with dichloro-dihydro-fluorescein diacetate
(DCFH-DA) for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, DCFH-DA
added cells were treated with Tanshinone I and/or TRAIL
for 1 h at 37°C. To measure intracellular levels of ROS,
the concentration of fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein
(DCF) was quantified in oxiselect intracellular ROS assay
kits (Cell Biolabs, CA, USA) using Fluoroskan Ascent
microplate fluorometer (Thomas scientific, NJ, USA).
