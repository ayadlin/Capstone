ABSTRACT
Colorectal cancer (CRC) arises from mutations in a subset of genes. We investigated
the germline and somatic mutation spectrum of patients with CRC in Taiwan by using the
AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel V2. Fifty paired freshly frozen stage 0–IV CRC tumors and
adjacent normal tissue were collected. Blood DNA from 20 healthy donors were used for
comparison of germline mutations. Variants were identified using an ion-torrent personal
genomic machine and subsequently confirmed by Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing.
Five nonsynonymous germline variants on 4 cancer susceptible genes, CDH1, APC, MLH1,
and NRAS, were observed in 6 patients with CRC (12%). Among them, oncogene NRAS
G138R variant was identified as having a predicted damaging effect on protein function,
which has never been reported by other laboratories. CDH1 T340A variants were presented
in 3 patients. The germline variants in the cancer patients differed completely from those
found in asymptomatic controls. Furthermore, a total of 56 COSMIC and 21 novel somatic
variants distributed in 20 genes were detected in 44 (88%) of the CRC samples. High
inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity levels were observed. Nine rare variants located in
the β-catenin binding region of the APC gene were discovered, 7 of which could cause
amino acid frameshift and might have a pathogenic effect. In conclusion, panel-based
mutation detection by using a high-throughput sequencing platform can elucidate racedependent cancer genomes. This approach facilitates identifying individuals at high risk
and aiding the recognition of novel mutations as targets for drug development.

role in controlling the cell proliferation process [4, 5].
Except in cases of somatic genomic alteration, CRC can
be inherited. The estimated fraction of CRC attributed to
inherited predisposition ranges between 10% and 30%.
Most cancer-susceptible genes are involved in restraining
cell proliferation, DNA repair, and genetic stability [6]. In
inherited CRC, defects in the tumor suppressor gene APC
is a well-known cause of familial adenomatous polyposis
(FAP), and hereditary nonpolyposis CRC (HNPCC) is due
to germline mutations on DNA mismatch repair (MMR)
genes such as MLH1 and MSH2 [7, 8].

INTRODUCTION
Internationally, more than 1 million people are
diagnosed for colorectal cancer (CRC) annually, and it
is the third leading cause of cancer mortality in Taiwan
[1]. CRC arises from a series of sequentially mutated
genes that can transform normal epithelial cells into
adenoma, eventually becoming adenocarcinoma [2, 3].
The polyp-to-cancer transition takes several years and
involves alteration of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC),
Kirsten-RAS(KRAS), TP53, and other genes that have a

RESULTS

In the past decade, the success of the Human
Genome Project has engendered unprecedented
advancements in “precision medicine” [9]. Mutationderived individual cancer therapy improves patient cure
rates. In metastatic CRC, cetuximab or panitumumab,
which are monoclonal antibodies and can specifically
block epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal
pathways, are effective only in patients with wild-type
KRAS and BRAF [10]. Currently, KRAS (Codons 12
and 13) and BRAFV600E mutation detection are routine
molecular companion tests in clinical laboratories
before the administration of monoclonal antibody
therapy. However, a considerable body of evidence
shows that other mutations occurring in genes on EGFR
pathways, such as NRAS [11] and KRAS Codons 61 and
146 [12], are associated with a poor response rate for
monoclonal antibody therapy. In addition, the Food
and Drug Administration has approved almost 30 types
of targeted cancer drugs to specific indications [13],
and hundreds of clinical trials are ongoing to develop
new drugs targeting certain genes exhibiting specific
mutations [14]. Prognosis prediction also relies on
specific gene mutation patterns for stratifying patients.
For instance, CRC patients with TP53 mutation,
particularly in Codon 175, have a shorter survival
period compared with those with wild-type TP53 [15,
16]. Therefore, developing a high-throughput screening
platform that can cover most cancer–related genes is
warranted in order to improve the management of
patient care.
Recently, targeted next-generation sequencing
(NGS) has provided unprecedented potential for
detecting underlying changes in the genetic architecture
of cancer in a comprehensive and economically feasible
manner [17]. The Cancer Genome Atlas study [18] as
well as several hospital- and commercial company-based
study groups [17, 19, 20] have used NGS platforms to
seek specific germline and somatic mutation signatures
in CRC, confirming the existence of population-specific
mutation patterns [21]. Moreover, race-dependent
differences could influence the survival rate of CRC
patients under certain conditions [22]. In the present
study, we aimed to discover germline and somatic
variants in paired tumors and adjacent normal tissues
from patients with CRC in Taiwan. Through extensive
sequencing on 50 cancer-related genes, a novel germline
mutation on oncogene NRAS, instead of on wellknown cancer-predisposing genes, was observed in
our population. Rare somatic variants with frameshift
mutations on APC and cetuximab resistance mutation on
KRAS were identified in the tumor tissues. The findings
obtained from this type of research can alter the design of
gene contents either for screening high-risk individuals
with a family history of CRC, or for candidate selection
for target therapy.

One novel germline variant on NRAS and 4
variants on 3 cancer susceptible genes detected
in the CRC-adjacent normal tissue samples but
not in the asymptomatic controls
To elucidate which genomic alterations were
inherited or acquired, paired tumor and adjacent
normal tissue samples were collected from 50 patients
with CRC. Table 1 lists the clinical features of all
enrolled participants. Sixty percent of CRC patients
received a diagnosis at early stage (stages 0–II), and
the location of tumors was evenly distributed among
the right site, left of the large intestine, and the rectum.
All patients received surgery to remove tumor lesions.
Only one patient with metastatic cancer received target
therapy of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab.
For an advanced comparison of germline variants
between cancer patients and the general population,
PBMC DNA samples were collected from 20 young
asymptomatic controls with normal CEA and iFOBT
lab data and no self-reported cancer history who were
recruited for this study.
Six (12%, 6/50) patients with CRC were identified
as carrying germline mutations after being subjected to
an analysis pipeline for nonsynonymous variants. Table
2 summarizes the location, annotation, and frequency
of the germline and somatic variants in the 6 CRC
patients. A total of 5 germline variants were detected
on 4 genes, among which a missense variant in the
E-cadherin gene (CDH1) T340A (COSMIC19821)
was present in 3 patients with CRC (Sample ID 1307,
1705, 1738), which represented a germline mutation
hotspot in our population (6%, 3/50). The other 2
variants (V1125A and V1352A) on APC and one variant
(R291Q) on MLH1 were observed in 3 patients with
a family history of CRC. Notably, one novel germline
mutation, NRAS G138R was observed in Sample ID
1736. In this case, SIFT software selects 122 sequences
which are closely related to Homo sapiens NRAS and
calculate the effect of G138R substitution on NRAS
function. It generates a score of 0.01 which is predicted
to be deleterious to affect NRAS function. On the
other hand, PolyPhen2 software aligns 75 amino acids
sequences surrounding the 138th Glycine position from
206 species and found 91.6% of identity in Glycine
which means high conservation in this position among
species. According to the phylogenetic and structural
information of this substitution, this NRAS G138R
mutation is predicted to be Possibly Damaging with a
score of 0.764 (sensitivity: 0.85; specificity: 0.92).This
germline variant harbored an oncogene instead of the
tumor suppressor gene or DNA repair gene, which are
typical in cases of inherited CRC.

Four patients with germline mutations had a family
history of CRC (Table 2), among whom Sample ID 1461
with APC V1125A variant had received a diagnosis of
HNPCC. Notably, APC is highly associated with FAP
and rarely reported in cases of HNPCC. However, this
patient developed HNPCC at the age of 47 years, which
was younger than most patients with germline mutations
in our study.
In general, germline mutations exhibit a mutation
frequency of approximately 50% in both normal and
tumor tissues. Except for germline variants, 5 of the 6
patients acquired at least one additional somatic mutation
in their paired tumor tissues. Notably, Sample ID 1736
gained 4 somatic mutations and Sample ID 1461 gained 9
additional somatic mutations in the tumor samples (except
for the inherited NRAS G138R and APC V1125A variant,
respectively). Apart from these 5 patients, only one
patient (Sample ID 1705) developed cancer with only one
heterozygous germline CDH1 mutation with the absence
of other somatic mutations.
To investigate the germline variants in the general
population, 20 PBMC DNA samples were collected from
the asymptomatic controls and examined. Figure 1 depicts
the germline variants obtained from the normal tissues of
the CRC patients and controls. Notably, 5 independent
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

variants were observed in each group. Compared with the
variants observed in the CRC group, the set of germline
alterations in the control group were completely distinct.
SMO R199W was the only COSMIC variant; the other
4 nonsynonymous variants were predicted as having
“tolerated” or “benign” impacts on protein function, and
sporadically presented in one individual.

Twenty-one novel somatic mutations detected in
the CRC tumor tissue samples
Initially, 830 variants were identified in the 50 tumor
tissue samples. After annotation, only nonsynonymous,
frameshift, or stopgain variants affecting the amino acid
constitution or function(s) of encoded proteins were filtered.
Those variants were further filtered with variants found
in adjacent normal tissue samples. Finally, a total of 77
distinct variants on 20 genes were identified and confirmed
by Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing. Among these, 21
(27%) were novel variants not in the COSMIC database.
Table 3 ranks the 77 somatic variants by frequency in the 44
CRC patients and provides the serial number of each variant
for each gene. According to the variant effect, 56 missense
mutations (73%), 13 indel mutations (17%), and 8 nonsense
mutations (10%) were identified. Missense mutations of

Codons 12 and 13 on KRAS (including G12V, G12D, G12S,
and G13D) were the most frequently observed variants
in the CRC samples (36%, 18/50). Indel and nonsense
mutations, which can lead to truncated proteins, were
distributed mostly on TP53 and APC genes.
Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of these variants
on 20 genes stratified according to each CRC patient. The
number of somatic variants in each CRC tumor sample
ranged from 0 to 9 with an average of 2.2. The most
frequently mutated gene was TP53 (46%), followed by KRAS
(44%), APC (32%), PIK3CA (24%), SMAD4 (14%), FBXW7
(10%), and NRAS (6%), all of which accounted for 88% of
CRC patients. The variant frequency in one tumor can be
quantified and marked according to the size and color of the
circle in Figure 2. The mutation frequency of each variant in
one tumor (in one column) can be compared to clarify the
possible clonal expansion history. Most tumors can exert
stepwise mutation on various genes. Moreover, we observed
multiple mutants in one gene. For example, in the tumor of
Sample ID 1736, 3 mutations were observed in the APC gene
including one 8 nucleotide deletion (Variant Serial Number
14 in Table 3) and 2 missense alterations (Variant Serial
Numbers 6 and 15). Other evidence of multiple mutations in
one gene can be discovered in the TP53 and PIK3CA genes
in Sample IDs 1459, 1461, and 1801.

mutation rate of the top 4 mutated genes and the average
variant frequency in the mutated tumors stratified by
cancer stage and tumor location. Except for the correlation
between the TP53 mutation rate and the advanced tumor
stage (65% vs 33.3%, P = .027), tumors at a higher stage
(stage III and IV) do not exhibit higher mutation rates
relative to the total gene mutation rate (85% vs 90% in
late stage vs early stage). Patients with tumors in the right
site appeared to have a higher KRAS mutation frequency
(right site vs left site vs rectum, 62% ± 21.6% vs 38%
± 17.6%, 31.9% ± 12.5%, P = .025), although only a
small portion of tumors exhibited KRAS mutation in the
right site (28.5%). No particular tendency in the mutation
pattern at different locations of the large intestine lumen
was observed.

Spatial distribution of the variants in the 4 most
frequently mutated genes in the CRC patients
and 78% of the novel variants on APC can result
in frameshifting and early protein termination
Figure 3 illustrates the spatial distribution of the
variants according to protein function domain in the 4 most
frequently mutated genes in the CRC patients. Reported
mutations and their frequency extracted from the COSMIC
database are also shown under the protein domain bar for
comparison. R175H on TP53, mutation of Codons 12 and
13 on KRAS, and E545K on PIK3CA were the highest
frequency mutations in our population (detected in at least
4 patients, marked with a green triangle in Figure 3). All
of these mutations also contributed to the most frequently

and CDH1 T340A was the most frequently occurring
mutation in the CRC group (Figure 1). In addition, 21
novel somatic variants were identified in the tumor
samples, among which 7 mutations were frameshift
alterations located in the central part of the APC gene,
which may alter the function of the APC protein (Table 3).
In studying the germline mutations, we unexpectedly
determined a novel NRAS G138R in one CRC patient. In
well-investigated inherited cancers, such as breast cancer
and colon cancer, germline mutations frequently occur
in tumor suppressor genes (eg, APC, STK11, and PTEN)
and DNA repair genes (eg, MLH1, MSH2, BRCA1, and
BRCA2) [3, 27]. Inherited mutations in oncogenes, which
can be predisposed to cancer, have only been reported
on missense mutations of the RET proto-oncogene for
multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A cancer syndrome
[28]. For our understanding, this is the first study to report
the finding of germline NRAS mutations in CRC patients.
NRAS belongs to the RAS oncogene family (KRAS, HRAS,
and NRAS) and Ras protein functions as a GTPase, which
can conduct signal transduction from the outside of the cell
to the nucleus. Previous literatures have reported that the
138th residue is located in the allosteric lobe of Ras protein
(residues 87-171) and is responsible for the interaction
with GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) [29]. GAPs
interact with Ras-GTP by insertion of the arginine finger
into the active site to switch “on” the GTP hydrolysis.

reported mutations in the COSMIC database (11%, 97%,
and 31% in each gene, indicated by the line length in
the figure). Otherwise, the remaining mutations were
distributed widely among the cancer-related genes with no
obvious hotspot. However, all mutations on the TP53 gene
were located in the DNA-binding domain, and the variants
on the APC gene were distributed in the β-catenin-binding
domain. Both domains are central parts of the TP53 and
APC proteins and govern the tumor suppression function
by binding the downstream ligands. Notably, we unveiled
21 novel variants in 11 genes, 9 of which were observed
in the APC gene (marked by a red triangle in Figure 3)
and were located in the mutation cluster region (MCR).
Furthermore, 78% (7/9) of these novel variants on the
APC gene can result in a frameshift and early protein
termination and may lead to deleterious consequences.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we established an analysis pipeline
for a well-designed cancer hotspot panel on an IT-PGM
platform and comprehensively investigated the germline
and somatic variants in CRC patients in a Taiwanese
population. The results reveal the existence of 5 germline
variants specifically in cancer patients but not in the
general population. Among the 5 germline mutants, NRAS
G138R is a novel mutation that has never been reported,

Based on this model, the Glycine to Arginine substitution
found in this study would possibly enhance downstream
signaling. Moreover, the mutation was predicted to have a
damaging effect on Ras protein function, as determined by
SIFT and Polyphen2 software. However, in vitro function
test of this mutant is needed to prove the cancer-prone
property.
The remaining germline mutations were located
in 3 cancer-susceptible genes: CDH1, APC, and MLH1.
Among these, CDH1 mutation has been recognized as
a risk for early onset diffuse gastric cancer in Western
countries [30]. However, CDH1 T340A was reported to
have a high association only with inherited and sporadic

colon cancer in a Korean population [31]. As many as
3 patients in our CRC group also carried this specific
heterozygous germline mutation (Table 2), indicating the
existence of an Asian-specific genome structure. Another
finding of interest is the role of APC in inherited CRC.
Although APC is a known causal gene for FAP with
high penetrance, the specific V1125A substitution and
another V1352A mutation observed in our study was
previously reported in a cohort study comprising 480
non-FAP patients [32]. Compared with CRC, most de
novo germline mutations in the general population are not
related to cancer development and have been designated to
benign alteration by protein function prediction software.

Recently, a commercial laboratory in the United States
reported descriptive findings from screening inherited
CRC from 586 patients by using the ColoNext™ NGS
panel, which recruits 14 genes [20]. That study showed
that 71% of patients with pathogenic mutations on CRCsusceptible genes met the syndrome-based testing criteria.
However, their panel did not include NRAS and no Asian
patients had positive findings. In summary, the result
of this study highlight the importance of establishing
a population-specific screening panel to maximize the
detection rate of germline mutation for cancer prevention.
Regarding somatic mutation, an average of 2.2
variants can be identified in each tumor. However, 12
patients harbored only one aberrant mutation in the TP53,
KRAS, PIK3CA, or NRAS gene in their tumor tissues
(Figure 2), emphasizing the dominant role of these genes
in carcinogenesis. Among all the variants, 21 somatic
variants (27%) were unique to Taiwanese CRC patients
(Table 3). Furthermore, 9 of these 21 variants were
located in the APC gene, 7 of which belong to the indeltype, which can cause truncation of the encoded APC
protein. The full length of APC acts as a tumor suppressor
protein, which can disconnect the Wnt signal pathway by
forming a multiprotein complex with Axin and β-catenin

and promoting the phosphorylation and subsequent
degradation of β-catenin [33]. More than 90% of the
reported APC mutations found in sporadic and inherited
CRC are nonsense or frameshift mutations located in the
β-catenin-binding region (MCR: Codons 1267-1529), and
the resulting shorter protein may lose its ability to bind
to β-catenin, thereby activating cell proliferation and
migration [34]. In the present study, 9 novel mutations
on the APC gene were distributed from Codons 1120 to
1554 and might contribute to carcinogenesis. Moreover,
a small-molecule compound was identified recently as
selectively poisoning cancer cell lines with truncated
APC [35], which might benefit the patients with APC
novel frameshift mutations in our population. Other nonCOSMIC mutations were involved in EGFR-RAS, PI3K,
and P53 signaling pathways.
The variant profile in each patient provided an
opportunity to inspect the inter- and intra-heterogeneous
nature of CRC tumors [36] by examining 77 variant
types distributed in 44 patients with CRC. We observed
only 2 patients (Sample IDs 1423 and 1669) had the
same mutation profile with KRAS G12D alteration. The
remaining 42 patients had unique mutation signatures
(Figure 2). This high inter-tumor heterogeneity may

be induced by the stochastic nature of genome damage
during passage through differences in tumor-initiating
insults, immune surveillance, and factors influencing
cancer progression [37]. The heterogeneity explains the
loose correlation between genotype and phenotype (Table
4). However, concordance to our finding, higher levels of
TP53 mutant DNA [38] or mutant p53 protein [39] can be
found in late AJCC stage of CRC tumors. One large cohort
study which recruited 1110 Chinese CRC patients revealed
that mutant KRAS and BRAF were associated with rightsited tumors [40] and it correlated with the poor response
to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibition
with cetuximab [41].
On the other aspect, intra-tumor heterogeneity can
be demonstrated by observing the highly extreme variant
frequency in one tumor and the discrepant finding of
common serial mutation order from APC to TP53 which
advised by Bert Vogelstein in 1988 [3]. According to the
theory, the earliest event in the colorectal cancer involves
the mutation of APC gene. Acquiring and accumulating
more somatic mutations on specific genes is essential for
malignant transformation (Supplementary Figure S1A).
However, the variant frequency on APC gene in each
tumor is not always the largest one in our study. This
phenomenon provides a clue that the APC may not be
the necessary driver gene. Another subclones which carry
the essential mutations gain growth advantage as tumor
progression (Supplementary Figure S1B). Both conditions
can occur in one tumor and cause the intra-tumor
heterogeneity. The nature of intra-tumor heterogeneity
may hinder the correct mutation profile detection and
the subsequent choice for personalized target therapy.
Consequently, it could be at the risk of introducing the
propagation of minor clones in the original tumor after
incomplete therapy. However, the impact and clinical
correlation of intra-tumor heterogeneity needs larger
sample cohort and long-term follow-up study.
The only one stage IV patient (Sample ID 1456)
who received palliative chemotherapy and cetuximab
in this study showed progression of bone metastasis 1
year later. After examination of the mutation profile of
this patient by using NGS Cancer Panel, one rare KRAS
mutation was observed at A146T. This mutation accounts
for only 0.5% of all KRAS mutations in the COSMIC
database. However, a recent study indicated that this
mutation reduces the sensitivity to anti-EGFR antibody
therapy [12]. The examination of other drug-actionable
targets through NGS cancer panel shows promise for
cancer patients to receive the newest therapy, even for
drugs undergoing clinical trials. Park applied NGS to 2221
clinical cases and observed clinically actionable alterations
in 76% of tumors, which is 3-fold the number of actionable
alterations detected by conventional diagnostic tests [42].
These findings strengthen the necessity of implementing
an NGS cancer panel in clinical settings instead of
conventional PCR strategies for detecting hotspots.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Collectively, the unexpected germline oncogene
mutation and high frequency of novel variants observed
in our cancer group may have an ethnic impact [43]. The
clinical implementation of the NGS cancer panel, either in
germline or somatic genome detection, is currently under
development in our laboratory with the aim of improving
the screening rate of cancer for high-risk individuals with
a family history of CRC and providing more actionable
information for physicians to improve medical care for
CRC patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study patients
CRC patients
Fifty patients with untreated CRC diagnosed in
2013 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Taiwan were
enrolled in this study. Cancer was staged according to the
2009 American Joint Committee on Cancer staging criteria
(7th edition) [23]. Clinicopathological factors, including
age, sex, plasma carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) data,
immuno-occult blood test (iFOBT) data, and the anatomic
subsite of tumors in the intestine lumen, were recorded
at enrollment. Tumor location was classified into 3 parts:
right site (tumors at the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic
flexure, and transverse colon); left site (tumors at the
splenic flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon);
and the rectum.
Asymptomatic controls
For the control group, we recruited 20 volunteers
from staffs at the Department of Laboratory Medicine
at Linkou Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. All controls
had no family history of CRC and had negative serum
CEA and iFOBT results. All patients and healthy
individuals were provided with a form of written
informed consent, and the study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital (101-4609A3).

Sample preparation and routine laboratory test
Fresh tumors and adjacent normal tissue samples
(at least 5-cm from the tumor site) were collected on
the day of operation from 50 patients with CRC. For the
control group, the EDTA blood samples were collected
from 20 asymptomatic controls. Genomic DNAs
were extracted using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at −80°C until
use. CEA and iFOBT were respectively determined
using an ADVIA Centaur® Analyzer (WI, USA) with a
cutoff of 5 ng/mL and OC-Sensor Diana Latex Reagent
(Eiken Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) with a cutoff of 100
ng/mL.

to 1.0 (tolerated). The PolyPhen-2 score ranges from 0.0
(tolerated) to 1.0 (deleterious).

AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel Version 2 (Life
Technologies, CA, USA) specifically targets 50 cancerrelated genes, most of which are tumor suppressor genes
and oncogenes, and harbors 2855 COSMIC (Catalogue of
somatic mutations in cancer) [24] hotspots (for detailed
information, see Supplementary Table S1). The AmpliSeq
Library was prepared according to the manufacturer’s
Ion AmpliSeq Library Kit protocol. In brief, 10 ng of
genomic DNA was extracted from the samples and PCR
was conducted to amplify 207 amplicons, with sizes
ranging from 49 to 140 bp, in one primer pool. After
AMPure bead purification, barcoded adapter-ligated
products were nick-translated, and the resulting library
concentration was determined using an Agilent 2100
bioanalyzer and adjusted to 10 pmole. Emulsion PCR and
enrichment were performed on an Ion One Touch System
by using the Ion OneTouch™ 200 Template Kit Version
2.0 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The samples were then sequenced using
the IT-PGM 200 Sequencing Kit Version 2.0 protocol.
To obtain an average depth of 1500 for each amplicon,
6 samples were pooled on one 316 chip, and 12 samples
were pooled on one 318 chip.

Variant confirmation
Mutations that met the filtering criteria were
further confirmed by Sanger sequencing when the variant
frequency was above 20%, or by pyrosequencing when the
variant frequency was 5%–20%.

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were summarized in
percentages, ranges, means, and standard deviations.
Between-group comparisons were conducted using
the Student t test, one-way ANOVA, and chi-square
test for each marker. A P value less than 0.05 (2-tailed)
was considered statistically significant. All statistical
tests were conducted using PASW Statistics 18. Protein
domain structure and distribution of variants on specific
proteins were plotted using DOG Version 1.0 (http://dog.
biocuckoo.org).

Bioinformatics analysis

The authors declare no conflict of financial or
nonfinancial competing interest.

Base sequences were processed initially by using
IT-PGM pipeline software (Torrent Suite Version 4.2),
and the sequences were aligned to human genome build
19 reference genome (hg19). Identification of variants
was facilitated by using the IT Variant Caller software
plugin (Life Technologies), and advanced annotation
was performed by uploading an exported VCF file from
Variant Caller to Vanno (developed by the Department of
Bioinformatics at Chang Gung University) [25]. Initially,
variants were selected by mutation type if they belonged
to nonsynonymous or frameshift or stopgain at the exonic
region. Variant frequencies >3% in the dbSNP-Asian
database were further filtered. To enhance the reliability
of these variants, only those mutations with a frequency
of >5% and variant coverage of >30 were considered
candidate variants for further analysis. Integrative
Genomics Viewer was employed to visualize the variants
by confirming the presence of possible strand biases and
alignment errors. Nomenclature of novel variants followed
the rules from Human Genome Variation Society (http://
www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/). Variants with amino acid
changes were further examined for whether the changes
were potentially damaging alterations by using Sorting
Tolerant From Intolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism
Phenotyping v2 (PolyPhen2) software, which can predict
the possible impact of an amino acid substitution on the
structure and function of a protein [26]. SIFT calculates
