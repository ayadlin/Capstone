Abstract
Colon cancer develops over a period of 10 to 15 years,
providing a window of opportunity for chemoprevention and
early intervention. However, few molecular targets for
effective colon cancer chemoprevention have been characterized and validated. Protein kinase CBII (PKCBII) plays a
requisite role in the initiation of colon carcinogenesis in
a preclinical mouse model by promoting proliferation and
increased B-catenin accumulation. In this study, we test
the hypothesis that PKCBII is an effective target for colon
cancer chemoprevention using enzastaurin (LY317615), a
PKCB-selective inhibitor, in a mouse model of colon carcinogenesis. We find that enzastaurin potently reduces
azoxymethane-induced colon tumor initiation and progression by inhibiting PKCBII-mediated tumor cell proliferation
and B-catenin accumulation. Biochemically, enzastaurin
reduces expression of the PKCBII- and B-catenin/T-cell
factor–regulated genes PKCbII, cyclooxygenase II , and
vascular endothelial growth factor, three genes implicated
in colon carcinogenesis. Our results show that enzastaurin is
an effective chemopreventive agent in a mouse model of
sporadic colon cancer that significantly reduces both tumor
initiation and progression by inhibiting expression of
proproliferative genes. Thus, PKCBII is an important target
for colon cancer chemoprevention and the PKCB-selective
inhibitor enzastaurin may represent an effective chemopreventive agent in patients at high risk for colon cancer.

Introduction
Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related
deaths in the United States (1). Numerous molecular alterations in
colon cancer have been identified, providing potential targets for
colon cancer therapy (2). However, few molecularly targeted
therapies have progressed to clinical trials for the treatment of
colon cancer. The time course of colon cancer development (10-15
years), coupled with the relative accessibility of the organ to serial
observation and sampling via endoscopy, has allowed the
identification and characterization of precursor lesions that can
be monitored to evaluate the effects of molecularly targeted, early

interventional therapy. For these reasons, colon cancer is well
suited for implementation of chemoprevention strategies.
Our previous work showed that PKChII plays a critical role in
colon carcinogenesis (3–5). PKChII mRNA abundance and protein
expression are highly induced in aberrant crypt foci and
subsequent colon tumors in the well-characterized azoxymethane
mouse model of sporadic colon carcinogenesis (3). Transgenic mice
expressing elevated PKChII in the colonic epithelium (transgenic
PKChII mice) are more susceptible to azoxymethane-induced
colon cancer than their nontransgenic littermates (5), whereas
PKCb / mice are resistant to azoxymethane-mediated colon
carcinogenesis (4, 6), demonstrating the requisite role of PKChII
in colon carcinogenesis.
Molecular and biochemical analysis of transgenic PKChII mice
revealed that their cancer-prone phenotype results from PKChIImediated hyperproliferation of the colonic epithelium, as characterized by an increased proliferative index and resultant
hypercellularity of colonic crypts (5, 7). This hyperproliferation
is mediated by reduced glycogen synthase kinase 3-h (GSK-3h)
activity and increased h-catenin expression in the colonic
epithelium of transgenic PKChII mice (5). Thus, PKChII induces
colonic epithelial hyperproliferation and enhanced susceptibility
to colon carcinogenesis likely through activation of a PKChII/
h-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF; Wnt signaling) axis (5). Interestingly,
we have shown that dietary N-3 fatty acids mediate their
chemopreventive effects through inhibition of PKChII-mediated
hyperproliferation in the colonic epithelium (7). These studies
define a procarcinogenic role for PKChII in the early stages of
colon carcinogenesis and directly implicate PKChII as a target for
chemoprevention.
Enzastaurin (LY317615), a macrocyclic bisinolymaleimide, is an
ATP-competitive inhibitor of serine/threonine kinases with high
selectivity for PKCh (8). Enzastaurin has been shown to inhibit
proliferation and induce apoptosis in cancer cell lines and human
xenograft tumors (8–10). Other preclinical studies showed that oral
administration of enzastaurin decreases plasma vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) levels and intratumoral blood vessel
formation (8, 11). Enzastaurin was found to be well tolerated with
few toxic side effects in a phase I study (12), and encouraging
results have been obtained in phase II studies of enzastaurin in
patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, relapsed/refractory
mantle cell lymphoma, and high-grade gliomas (13–15). Although
enzastaurin has shown promising results as a chemotherapeutic
in clinical trials, it has not been evaluated in a chemoprevention
setting.
In this study, we tested the hypothesis that PKChII is an effective
target for colon cancer chemoprevention using enzastaurin. We
find that enzastaurin inhibits azoxymethane-induced colon tumor
initiation and progression and suppresses tumor cell proliferation.
This is likely due to repression of expression of several PKChII/

h-catenin–regulated, proproliferative genes. Our data show that
PKChII is an effective target for colon cancer chemoprevention and
that enzastaurin may be useful in a chemopreventive setting in
high-risk colon cancer patients.

Materials and Methods
Mice. Female FVB/N mice were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory.
PKCb / mice on a C57Bl/6 background (16) and control nontransgenic
C57Bl/6 mice (originally purchased from The Jackson Laboratory) were
used for analysis of colonic epithelial cell proliferation. All animals were
housed in microisolator cages in a pathogen-free barrier facility and
maintained at a constant temperature and humidity on a 12-h light/
12-h dark cycle with free access to food and filtered water. All of the animal
experiments and procedures performed in this study were approved by the
Mayo Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Enzastaurin administration and tissue isolation. Mice were fed
pelleted, control diet (AIN-76A), or control diet with increasing concentrations of enzastaurin ad libitum throughout the experiments. Food
consumption was monitored by weighing food upon addition to cage and at
removal of unconsumed diet (twice weekly). All defined animal diet used
in these studies was prepared by Research Diets, Inc. After being fed
experimental diets for 2 wk, mice were euthanized by CO2 asphyxiation. All
mice were harvested between 9:00 and 11:00 a.m. to reduce diurnal
variations. Colons were excised from cecum to rectum, flushed with cold
PBS, and slit longitudinally. Colon tissue (1.5 cm) was isolated from the
distal and proximal ends of the colon and fixed in 10% buffered formalin for
histology. After 4 h, the colons were washed in cold PBS and stored in 70%
ethanol at 4jC until processing for histology. Purified colonic crypts were
isolated from the remaining colon using our previously characterized
isolation procedure (4).
Plasma collection and analysis of enzastaurin concentration. At the
time of harvest, blood was isolated by cardiac puncture into heparinized
tubes. Blood was kept on ice until centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 15 min at
4jC, and then the plasma was transferred to a separate tube and stored at
20jC until liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry analysis of
enzastaurin concentration.
Carcinogenesis protocol. Female FVB/N mice (6 wk old) were enrolled
in our previously described carcinogen protocol (3). One week before
azoxymethane injections, mice were randomly assigned to control (AIN76A) or enzastaurin-containing (AIN-76A with 0.272% enzastaurin) diets
(30 and 33 mice, respectively). Azoxymethane was purchased from the
National Cancer Institute’s Chemical Carcinogen Reference Standards
Repository (operated under contract by Midwest Research Institute, no.
N02-CB-07008). Mice were injected i.p. with 10 mg/kg azoxymethane once a
week for 4 wk. All mice were sacrificed 22 wk after the last azoxymethane
injection. Colons were excised from cecum to rectum, flushed with cold
PBS, slit longitudinally, and fixed flat in 10% buffered formalin. The left
kidney and liver were removed, weighed, and fixed in 10% buffered formalin
for histologic analysis.
Tumor analysis and image capture. Fixed colons were stained briefly
with 0.5% methylene blue and evaluated for the presence of colon tumors.
The location and size of each colon lesion was recorded. Tumors were
isolated, along with adjacent normal epithelium, and processed for
histopathologic examination that was performed by a board-certified
pathologist who was blinded to the treatment status of the mice. All stained
slides were scanned using the T2 ScanScope console (Aperio Technologies)
and images were captured using Aperio ImageScope software.
Proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. One hour before harvest,
mice were injected i.p. with 50 Ag/kg 5¶-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd).
Formalin-fixed colonic epithelium was analyzed for proliferation as
determined by detection of incorporation of BrdUrd (7, 17). Images of
slides of colon tumors stained to detect BrdUrd incorporation were
captured using the T2 ScanScope console (Aperio Technologies). Automated proliferative analysis was performed by quantitating BrdUrd-positive
cells using an automated thresholding algorithm specific for nuclear

Cancer Res 2009; 69: (4). February 15, 2009

staining (provide with the ImageScope analysis software; ref. 18). The
proliferative index was calculated for each colon tumor as the ratio of
BrdUrd-positive nuclei to the sum of all nuclei. A minimum of 2,000 nuclei
were evaluated for BrdUrd staining in each tumor.
Apoptosis was detected in azoxymethane-induced tumors by TdTmediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) of fragmented DNA in
formalin-fixed colon tumors using the DeadEnd Colorimetric TUNEL
System (Promega). Using the Aperio algorithm for nuclear staining, the
apopototic index was calculated as the ratio of TUNEL-positive nuclei to the
sum of all nuclei.
Angiogenesis was characterized in azoxymethane-induced tumors
by quantitative analysis of immunohistochemical detection of CD31
(PECAM-1) expression using an anti-CD31 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) as previously described (19, 20). Using the Aperio image
analysis software, an algorithm for positive pixel labeling was performed in
which the relative area of blood vessels was calculated as the ratio of CD31positive pixels to the sum of all pixels.
Immunoblot and quantitative reverse transcription–mediated realtime PCR analysis. Purified colonic epithelial cells were isolated as colonic
crypts and subjected to immunoblot analysis for PKChII, GSK-3h, phosphoGSK-3hSer9, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), and phospho-ERK1/2 using antibodies purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology as
previously described (4, 17, 21). Densitometric analysis of immunoblots was
performed using the Kodak Molecular Imaging System.
Total RNA was isolated from purified colonic epithelial cells and
subjected to quantitative reverse transcription-mediated real-time PCR
(qPCR) analysis as previously described (4). All primers and probes were
purchased from Applied Biosystems. Data were normalized to glyeraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA abundance to control
for RNA concentration.
Immunohistochemical detection of B-catenin. Formalin-fixed control
and enzastaurin-treated colon tumors of all histologic grades were analyzed
for h-catenin expression and localization by immunohistochemical analysis
using an antibody specific for h-catenin (BD Transduction Laboratories)
and DAKO Envision Dual Link + detection system (DAKO). Tissues were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Azoxymethane-induced colon tumors
were scored on a scale of 0 to 4 based on the percent of tumor cells that
exhibited predominantly cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of h-catenin
(0 = none, 1 = 0-25%, 2 = 26-50%, 3 = 51-75%, and 4 = 76-100%). This analysis
was performed by an investigator blinded to the treatment status of the
sample (A.P.F.).
Statistical analysis. Fisher’s exact analysis was used to compare tumor
incidence and distribution of tumor stage between treatment groups. Oneway ANOVA was used to compare the means of tumor volume, tumor
burden, and average tumor number (per tumor-bearing mouse) between
experimental groups. ANOVA analysis was used to compare the means
of the BrdUrd labeling index, apoptotic index, CD31 staining, h-catenin
mislocalization score, and mRNA abundance between experimental groups.

Results and Discussion
Establishing a physiologically relevant dose of enzastaurin.
Published pharmacologic studies predicted that steady-state
plasma concentrations of enzastaurin would be achieved within
2 weeks of daily oral administration (22). Therefore, mice were fed
a pelleted, purified rodent diet (AIN-76A, control diet) supplemented with 0.034%, 0.068%, 0.136%, and 0.272% enzastaurin by
weight for 2 weeks. Food consumption and enzastaurin exposure
were determined as described in Materials and Methods (Supplementary Table). Enzastaurin plasma concentrations were analyzed
by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (Supplementary Table). The highest dose of enzastaurin (0.272% by weight)
yielded an average plasma concentration of 4.8 F 2.5 Amol/L
(Supplementary Table), which is similar to the plasma concentration of enzastaurin that inhibits xenograft tumor formation in mice

(8). Therefore, we chose to administer enzastaurin at this
concentration to evaluate its chemopreventive effects in azoxymethane-induced tumorigenesis.
Enzastaurin inhibits azoxymethane-induced tumor initiation and progression. To assess the efficacy of enzastaurin as a
chemopreventive agent, mice were given either control diet or
control diet supplemented with 0.272% enzastaurin beginning 1
week before carcinogen administration (see Supplementary Fig. S1
for timeline). The mice were maintained on these diets until
22 weeks after the last azoxymethane injection, at which time the
mice were euthanized and evaluated for tumor formation.
Enzastaurin treatment had no detectable toxicity at the dose
administered, as determined by a lack of significant effect on
mouse weight gain (Fig. 1A), survival (26 of 30 for control versus
32 of 33 for enzastaurin treatment), or liver and kidney histology
(data not shown).
Eighty percent (21 of 26) of control mice developed colon tumors
during the experimental period, whereas only 50% (16 of 32) of the
enzastaurin-treated mice developed colon tumors (Fig. 1B).
Enzastaurin treatment also caused a decrease in tumor volume
and tumor burden; however, these effects did not reach statistical
significance (Table 1). To assess the effect of enzastaurin on tumor
progression, colon tumors were characterized as low-grade
adenoma, high-grade adenoma, or carcinoma (23). The majority
of the tumors from mice in both treatment groups were

characterized as low-grade adenomas (Fig. 1C and D). However,
enzastaurin treatment resulted in a significant increase in the
percentage of tumors that were low-grade adenoma (88%, versus
61% in the control diet group, P = 0.041; Fig. 1C). A trend
toward decreased average tumor number per tumor-bearing mouse
(tumor multiplicity) was also observed in enzastaurin-treated mice
(Table 1). Moreover, when average tumor number was evaluated

based on histologic grade, a statistically significant decrease in
average tumor number of high-grade adenomas and carcinomas
was observed in enzastaurin-treated mice (Table 1). Taken together,
these data show that enzastaurin inhibits both colon tumor
initiation and progression, consistent with the requirement for
PKChII for tumor formation (4, 6).
Enzastaurin administration inhibits tumor cell proliferation. Transgenic PKChII mice exhibit hyperproliferation of the
colonic epithelium and increased susceptibility to colon carcinogenesis, indicating that PKChII drives carcinogenesis via hyperproliferation (4, 5). Therefore, we evaluated the effect of
enzastaurin on colon tumor cell proliferation (Fig. 2). Enzastaurin
significantly reduced cellular proliferation in azoxymethaneinduced tumors (Fig. 2A and B). In contrast, enzastaurin had no
significant effect on basal proliferation of mouse colonic epithelial
cells (Fig. 2C). Likewise, genetic knockout of PKCh did not
significantly alter basal colonic epithelial cell proliferation
(Fig. 2D). Therefore, enzastaurin selectively inhibits tumor cell
proliferation, but not proliferation of nontransformed colonic
epithelial cells, consistent with a mechanism of action involving
PKChII inhibition, because PKChII overexpression in the colonic
epithelium promotes hyperproliferation (5) but inhibition of PKCh
expression does not inhibit proliferation of nontransformed colonic
epithelial cells (Fig. 2D). Selective inhibition of tumor cell
proliferation suggests that enzastaurin would be an effective
chemopreventive agent.
Enzastaurin has been reported to induce apoptosis in human
tumor cell lines (8, 9) and inhibit angiogenesis in xenograft tumors
(10, 24). We evaluated the effect of enzastaurin on tumor cell
apoptosis and angiogenesis. Enzastaurin treatment did not

significantly alter TUNEL labeling (apoptosis) or CD31 expression
(angiogenesis) in azoxymethane-induced colon tumors (Fig. 3).
The lack of detectable effect of enzastaurin on colon tumor
apoptosis may be due to the inherent differences in susceptibility
to apoptosis of tumor cell lines in vitro and in the xenograft tumor
models, compared with endogenous colon tumors developing
in situ (8–10). Our data indicate that the major mechanism by
which enzastaurin prevents tumor formation and progression is by
inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.
Enzastaurin blocks PKCBII-mediated signaling in the
colonic epithelium. PKChII promotes proliferation and susceptibility to carcinogenesis by regulating expression of pro-proliferative
genes in mouse colonic epithelium (4, 25). Among the targets of
PKChII is PKChII itself, which is up-regulated through an autocrine
mechanism in vitro and in the colonic epithelium in vivo (4).
Because PKChII regulates its own expression, we assessed whether
enzastaurin-mediated inhibition of PKChII leads to reduced
PKChII expression in the colonic epithelium, as a specific measure
of inhibition of PKChII signaling. As expected, enzastaurin
dramatically decreased expression of PKChII mRNA (Fig. 4A) and
protein (Fig. 4B) in the colonic epithelium, indicating that
enzastaurin inhibits PKChII-mediated signaling in the colonic
epithelium.
We next evaluated the effect of enzastaurin on PKChII-driven
oncogenic pathways in the colonic epithelium. We have previously
shown that PKChII activates two signaling pathways critical to
colon cancer development, the APC/h-catenin/TCF (5) and RasPKCiota/Rac1-Mek (26) pathways. Aberrant activation of the APC/
h-catenin/TCF signaling pathway occurs in a majority of both
mouse and human colon tumors, resulting in the stabilization and

nuclear accumulation of h-catenin (27, 28). GSK-3h is a key
negative regulator of APC/h-catenin/TCF signaling (29). Overexpression of PKChII in mouse colonic epithelium decreases GSK3h activity in vivo (5) and PKCh directly phosphorylates and
inhibits GSK-3h in vitro (30). Enzastaurin has been previously
shown to reduce GSK-3hser9 phosphorylation in cancer cells in vitro
and in xenograft tumors in mice (8–10). Thus, we assessed the
status of GSK-3h phosphorylation in the colonic epithelium of
enzastaurin-treated mice. We found that enzastaurin significantly
reduced GSK-3hser9 phosphorylation in the colonic epithelium
without altering the expression of GSK-3h (Fig. 4C and D).
GSK-3h mediates its negative effect on APC/h-catenin/TCF
signaling by phosphorylating h-catenin and targeting it for

ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (29). Overexpression
of PKChII in the colonic epithelium drives increased expression of
h-catenin, likely through inhibition of GSK-3h (5). Because PKChII
overexpression increases h-catenin in the colonic epithelium (5),
we predicted that enzastaurin treatment would reduce h-catenin
expression. Therefore, we assessed the effect of enzastaurin on
the expression and subcellular localization of h-catenin (Fig. 5A).
h-Catenin exhibits highly restricted localization at the basolateral
membrane of normal intestinal epithelial cells (Fig. 5A, top images).
Enzastaurin treatment had no significant effect on the expression
or subcellular localization of h-catenin in the normal colonic
epithelium (Fig. 5A, top images). Azoxymethane-induced colon
tumors exhibited substantial elevation of h-catenin expression

Figure 5. Enzastaurin reduces tumor-associated increased expression and

tumors (bottom panels ) from control mice (left panels ) and enzastaurin-treated
mice (right panels). Representative images of h-catenin immunostaining are

(Fig. 5A, bottom left). This increase in h-catenin expression was
accompanied by a redistribution of h-catenin to both the
cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. 5A, bottom left). In contrast, tumors
from enzastaurin-treated mice expressed lower levels of h-catenin
than tumors from control mice, with most tumor cells exhibiting
primarily membrane localization of h-catenin (Fig. 5A, bottom
right). A significant reduction in nuclear and cytoplasmic h-catenin
was observed in tumors from enzastaurin-treated mice (2.1 F 1.2
for enzastaurin-treated tumors versus 2.8 F 1.1 for control tumors,
P = 0.045; see Materials and Methods for a detailed description of
the analysis). The reduction in h-catenin mislocalization was most
dramatic in low-grade adenomas from enzastaurin-treated mice
(1.5 F 0.5 versus 3.3 F 1.0 for control tumors P = 5.45  10 5). The
level of mislocalized h-catenin in high-grade adenomas (3.3 F 1.5
for enzastaurin-treated tumors versus 2.5 F 1.1 for control tumors)
and carcinomas (3.0 F 1.4 for enzastaurin-treated tumors versus
2.6 F 1.1 for control tumors) was not significantly altered by

enzastaurin treatment. The lack of an observed effect of
enzastaurin on h-catenin mislocalization in higher-grade tumors
may be due to the lower number of tumors available for analysis
(see Table 1) or may reflect the fact that the likely target of
enzastaurin, PKChII, plays a critical role in the early stages of colon
carcinogenesis, whereas genetic mutations acquired later in the
carcinogenic process, including those in APC or h-catenin, may
overcome the requirement for PKChII in colon carcinogenesis.
Genetic knockout of PKCh has no significant effect on intestinal
tumorigenesis in ApcMin/+ mice, supporting this conclusion (6).
Because PKChII expression in the colonic epithelium is required
for azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis (4, 6) and PKChII
overexpression induces h-catenin accumulation in the colonic
epithelium (5), our current data suggest that enzastaurin blocks
tumor proliferation by inhibiting PKChII-mediated inhibition of
GSK-3h, thereby preventing stabilization of h-catenin and transcriptional up-regulation of proproliferative genes.
A second procarcinogenic signaling pathway is frequently
activated in colon cancer through mutational activation of the
K-ras proto-oncogene (31, 32). Oncogenic K-ras promotes hyperproliferation in the colonic epithelium through Mek activation (33).
PKChII has been implicated as a regulator of K-ras signaling
in vitro (26). We therefore evaluated the effect of enzastaurin
treatment on the activation status of the downstream effector of
the Ras-Mek pathway, ERK1/2. Whereas some variability within the
treatment groups was observed (Fig. 4C and D), no significant
difference was detected in the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
control and enzastaurin-treated colonic epithelium (Fig. 4C and D).
These data suggest that enzastaurin does not significantly alter
Mek-ERK signaling.
Enzastaurin inhibits expression of proproliferative, procarcinogenic genes. VEGF-A is a transcriptional target of h-catenin/
TCF known to promote tumor growth and metastasis by
stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and migration necessary
for angiogenesis (34, 35). A relationship between PKChII and
VEGF expression has clearly been established in the kidney, as
well as in tumor xenograft models (11, 36, 37). Genetic knockout
of PKCb, as well as pharmacologic inhibition, using the PKCh
inhibitor, ruboxistaurin, blocked VEGF-A expression in the mouse
kidney (11, 36, 37). However, the effect of enzastaurin on VEGF-A
expression in the colon has not been evaluated. We assessed
VEGF-A expression in the colonic epithelial cells from enzastaurin-treated mice. Enzastaurin significantly reduced the expression of VEGF-A mRNA in mouse colonic epithelial cells
in vivo (Fig. 5B). Despite a significant decrease in VEGF-A
expression in the colonic epithelial cells, we did not observe
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis (as measured by CD31 staining)
by enzastaurin in azoxymethane-induced colon tumors (Fig. 3B).
Although VEGF promotes angiogenesis through its effects on
endothelial cells, colon cancer cells as well as human tumors also
express VEGFR (38, 39). Likewise, in vitro evidence suggests that
VEGF promotes colon cancer cell proliferation (38). Therefore,
another possible mechanism of enzastaurin-mediated inhibition
of proliferation of azoxymethane-induced colon tumors may be
the reduced expression of a tumor-specific autocrine growth
factor (VEGF).
Cyclooxygenase 2 (Cox-2) expression is induced in human colon
tumors and is a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer (40). Cox2 is expressed at a very low level in normal mouse epithelium and
is significantly increased in azoxymethane-induced colon tumors
in rodents (41, 42). Cancer-prone transgenic PKChII mice exhibit

Enzastaurin Represses Carcinogen-Induced Colon Cancer

increased Cox-2 expression in the colonic epithelium similar to
levels that occurs in early colon carcinogenesis (3, 25). Therefore,
we evaluated the effect of enzastaurin treatment on Cox-2
expression in the colonic epithelium. Enzastaurin significantly
repressed Cox-2 expression (Fig. 5C). Pharmacologic inhibition of
Cox-2 also significantly reduces azoxymethane-induced tumorigenesis in rodents (42, 43), suggesting that enzastaurin-mediated
repression of Cox-2 expression may be critical to its inhibition of
azoxymethane-induced tumor proliferation.
The ability of enzastaurin to repress Cox-2 expression is of
particular interest in the context of colon cancer chemoprevention
because clinical and epidemiologic studies have shown the efficacy
of Cox-2 inhibitors [primarily nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAID)] in the prevention of human colon cancer (reviewed
in ref. 44). However, recent reports of cardiovascular complications
resulting from long-term NSAID use in humans have dampened
enthusiasm for the use of Cox-2 inhibitors for colon cancer
chemoprevention (45, 46). This is due to the fact that the
requirements for an effective cancer chemopreventive agent are
quite different than for a cancer therapeutic, as a chemopreventive
drug will be administered for a longer duration and therefore the
cumulative exposure will be much greater. In addition, because a
chemopreventive drug will be administered to a population who is
only at risk for a disease, the tolerance for adverse side effects is
much lower. In this regard, enzastaurin is orally available, making it
amenable to longer-term dosing, and has been found to be well
tolerated and associated with minimal toxicities in several phase II
clinical trials (13, 15). Our results suggest that enzastaurin may
confer the ability to down-regulate Cox-2 in a chemopreventive
setting, without the side effects associated with Cox-2 inhibitors.
In this report, we evaluated the PKCh-selective inhibitor
enzastaurin as a potential colon cancer chemotherapeutic agent.
We determined that enzastaurin significantly reduced azoxymethane-mediated colon tumor initiation and progression. A
primary mechanism by which enzastaurin reduced tumorigenesis
was via selective inhibition of proliferation in tumor cells but not
nontransformed colonic epithelial cells. At the dose used, PKChII is
clearly not the only kinase inhibited by enzastaurin (8); however,
many of the mechanistic and gene expression changes affected by
enzastaurin in this model have been shown to be mediated by
PKChII (4, 5, 7, 25). Given that overexpression of PKChII in the
colonic epithelium induces hyperproliferation and increased
susceptibility to azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis (5),
whereas genetic inhibition of PKCh expression has no effect on
proliferation of nontransformed colonic epithelium, but blocks
azoxymethane-induced ACF and tumor formation (4, 6), the
inhibitory effect of enzastaurin on tumor formation and proliferation is likely mediated by inhibition of PKChII. Enzastaurin

reduces inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK-3h, reduces tumorassociated increased h-catenin expression and mislocalization, and
promotes a more ‘‘normal’’ subcellular distribution of h-catenin in
colon tumors. Whereas numerous studies have detected an
enzastaurin-mediated decrease in GSK-3h phosphorylation (which
should result in increased GSK-3h activity; refs. 8, 9), this is the first
report of enzastaurin reducing the increased expression and altered
subcellular localization of h-catenin normally observed in colon
tumors.
It is interesting that enzastaurin represses expression of both
Cox-2 and VEGF-A in the normal colonic epithelium, but only
inhibits proliferation of tumor cells. Whereas Cox-2 and VEGF
clearly play an important role in colon carcinogenesis and
angiogenesis (34, 42, 44), our results suggest that these genes either
do not play a role in basal proliferation of the colonic epithelium or
are not sufficiently reduced in expression to significantly affect
proliferation of normal colonic epithelial cells. Cox-2 has been
characterized to be up-regulated by h-catenin/TCF signaling and
PKChII overexpression in the colonic epithelium (25, 47). Conversely, overexpression of Cox-2 leads to accumulation of prostaglandin E2, which can inactivate GSK-3h in colon cancer cells,
inducing h-catenin/TCF signaling and increased VEGF expression
(48, 49). The exact mechanism by which enzastaurin represses Cox2 expression and inhibits tumor-associated increased h-catenin
expression and translocation will require further study; however,
our data suggest that enzastaurin may be uniquely effective in colon
cancer chemoprevention, selectively suppressing tumor-associated
hyperproliferation, resulting in reduced colon tumor initiation and
progression. Taken together with currently available clinical data
regarding safety and bioavailability, our data strongly suggest that
enzastaurin may be an effective chemopreventive agent for patients
at high risk for colon cancer.
