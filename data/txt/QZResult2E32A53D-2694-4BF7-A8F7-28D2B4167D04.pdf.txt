BACKGROUND: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) in the treatment of small bowel adenocarcinoma is poorly defined. Previous
analyses have been limited by small sample sizes and have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage. METHODS: Patients with
resected small bowel adenocarcinoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC] pathologic stage I-III) who were receiving AC
(n 5 1674) or surgery alone (SA; n 5 3072) were identified in the NCDB (1998-2011). Cox regression identified covariates associated
with overall survival (OS). AC and SA cohorts were matched (1:1) by propensity scores based on the likelihood of receiving AC or the
survival hazard from Cox modeling. OS was compared with Kaplan-Meier estimates. RESULTS: The omission of AC conferred an
increased risk of death (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-1.50; P <.001). After propensity score matching, there was a
nonsignificant trend toward improved OS with AC in AJCC stage I patients (158.8 vs 110.7 months; P 5.226) and AJCC stage II
patients (104.0 vs 79.6 months; P 5.185), including the subset with a T4 tumor classification (64.0 vs 47.4 months; P 5.130) or a positive resection margin (44.4 vs 31.0 months; P 5.333). Median OS was superior for patients with AJCC stage III disease who were
receiving AC versus SA (42.4 vs 26.1 months; P <.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of AC for resected stage III small
bowel adenocarcinoma. The trend toward improved OS for patients without nodal metastasis, including those who have T4 tumors or
have undergone positive-margin resection, may justify the use of AC in select patients with earlier stage disease. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Although the small bowel accounts for the majority of the absorptive surface area of the gastrointestinal tract, small bowel
malignancies are rare. It has been estimated that 9410 new cases of small bowel cancer and 1260 deaths from small bowel cancer occur annually in the United States.1 Small bowel adenocarcinoma accounts for approximately 3140 new cases annually,
the majority of which present with locoregional disease.2 Surgical resection remains the primary component of treatment;
however, distant recurrence is frequent after surgical resection,3-6 and this suggests a role for adjuvant systemic therapy.
Utilization of adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) has increased substantially over the last 2 decades for patients with small
bowel adenocarcinoma.7 This has likely been driven by the survival trends observed for patients with adenocarcinoma of
the large intestine, for whom chemotherapy is associated with improved long-term survival for node-positive disease.8,9 To
date, no randomized controlled studies have assessed the survival benefit of AC for small bowel adenocarcinoma,10 whereas
single-center, retrospective studies have not demonstrated an improvement in overall survival (OS) with AC.6,11-14
Using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a large population-representative cancer registry, we compared the
survival impact of AC and surgery alone (SA) in patients with small bowel adenocarcinoma undergoing curative-intent
resection. A propensity score matching methodology was used to minimize the effects of confounding by indication in different treatment groups.15

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source

After institutional review board approval, data from 1998
to 2012 were acquired from the small bowel participant
use file of the NCDB, a collaborative effort between the
American Cancer Society and the American College of
Surgeons’ Commission on Cancer. Established in 1989,
the NCDB is a comprehensive oncology surveillance program that captures approximately 70% of all new cancer
diagnoses in the United States from more than 1500
Commission on Cancer–approved centers.16
Patient Selection

Patients with invasive small bowel adenocarcinoma
(defined as topography codes C17.0-C17.9 from International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd edition17
who had undergone curative-intent resection for American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathologic stage
I to III disease between 1998 and 2011 were identified.
Patients were excluded if they had received neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, had received radiotherapy at any time, had
undergone palliative therapy, or had died within the first
90 days after surgery. Patients diagnosed in 2012 were
excluded to ensure at least 1 year of follow-up for all
patients.
Variables

The demographic and clinical NCDB variables used in
this study have been defined previously.18-22 Our primary
outcome, OS, was defined as the interval between the date
of diagnosis and the date of death or last contact. AC was
defined as the receipt of either single-agent or multiagent
chemotherapy without a documented history of neoadjuvant or perioperative treatment. Salvage chemotherapy,
defined as the initiation of chemotherapy more than 6
months after the operation, was excluded.

stepwise selection (P  .05 for entry, P > .10 for
removal).
Propensity scores were developed that accounted for
all factors significantly associated with either the receipt of
AC or the survival hazard from Cox modeling.15 Individual scores were calculated through logistic regression
modeling on the basis of the following 11 covariates: age,
median income (dichotomized at $48,000), population
density (urban vs rural), academic affiliation of the treating facility, year of diagnosis, tumor location (duodenum
vs jejunoileal), AJCC pathologic stage, T stage classification, nodal involvement, histologic grade, and margin status. Subjects receiving either SA or AC were matched 1:1
with these propensity scores via the greedy nearest neighbor matching algorithm without replacement.23 A caliper
size of 0.1 times the logarithm of the standard deviation of
the propensity score was used to minimize treatment
bias.24 Standardized differences were estimated before
and after matching to evaluate the balance of covariates;
small absolute values (<0.1) indicated balance between
the treatment groups. After propensity score matching,
OS of SA and AC patients was examined with KaplanMeier estimates via the Klein-Moeschberger methodology.25 P values  .05 were considered statistically significant; all tests were 2-sided. Analyses were performed with
SPSS 22.0 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).
RESULTS
Treatment Trends

The utilization of chemotherapy steadily increased over
the study period (P < .001). The proportion of AJCC
stage I to III patients who received AC increased by
19.2% (from 24.2% in 1998 to 43.4% in 2011). The majority of patients received multiagent chemotherapy
(59.4%) versus single-agent chemotherapy (29.9%) or an
unknown regimen (10.7%).
Utilization of AC

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics are presented as frequencies for categorical variables and as medians and interquartile ranges
(IQRs) for continuous variables. Pearson’s v2 test or Fisher’s exact test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test were used
to analyze categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Variables significantly associated with chemotherapy receipt in the univariate analysis (P  .05) were
entered into a stepwise, logistic regression model (P  .05
for entry, P > .10 for removal) to identify independent
predictors of chemotherapy utilization. OS was analyzed
with Cox proportional hazards modeling with backwards

Before propensity score matching, 4746 patients—3072
SA patients (64.7%) and 1674 AC patients (35.3%)—
met the study criteria. The median age was 66 years (IQR,
55-75 years), 53.2% of the patients were male, and 81.3%
of the patients were white. A univariate analysis demonstrated significant differences in patient and tumor features in the SA and AC cohorts (age, median income,
facility type, year of diagnosis, tumor location, AJCC
pathologic stage, pathologic T-stage classification, nodal
involvement, tumor size, histologic grade, and margin status). Race, insurance status, and location (both geographic
region and population density) were not associated with

tumor size, and histologic grade were not independently
associated with the utilization of chemotherapy.
Effect of AC on Survival in the Unmatched
Cohort

The impact of adjuvant therapy on OS between 1998
and 2011 was examined in the unmatched cohort
Cancer

(n 5 4746) with Cox proportional hazards modeling.
Variables significantly associated with OS in the univariate analysis (ie, age, race, Hispanic ethnicity, median income, population density, facility type, year of
diagnosis, tumor location, AJCC pathologic stage, pathologic T-stage classification, nodal status, histologic grade,
margin status, and administration of chemotherapy) were
entered into a multivariate Cox regression. After adjustments for potential confounders, the omission of chemotherapy (HR 1.36, 95% CI 1.24-1.50, p < 0.001) as well
as several other factors (Table 1) conferred an increased
risk of death. Race, Hispanic ethnicity, year of diagnosis,
and AJCC pathologic stage—in a model including pathologic T-stage classification and nodal involvement—were
not associated with risk-adjusted OS.
Effect of Adjuvant Therapy on Survival in the
Propensity Score–Matched Cohort

To better control for the treatment bias associated with
the administration of AC, patients were matched 1:1
according to the likelihood of receiving chemotherapy or
factors associated with the survival hazard in the
unmatched cohort. The resulting propensity score–
matched cohort included 2297 patients: 1155 (50.3%) in
the SA group and 1142 (49.7%) in the AC group (Fig. 1).

academic affiliation of the treating institution, year of
diagnosis, AJCC pathologic stage, pathologic T-stage
classification, nodal involvement, and margin-positive
resection were successfully balanced after matching (Table
2). There was, however, a persistent difference in tumor
location between the propensity-matched cohorts
(P < .001).
At a median follow-up of 66.7 months (IQR, 35.5104.5 months), the median OS of the propensitymatched cohort was 53.3 months (IQR, 20.0-161.3
months). There was a significant survival advantage for
patients who received AC versus SA (median OS, 63.2 vs
44.5 months; P < .001; HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.68-0.86;
Fig. 2). With stratification by the pathologic stage, there
was no significant survival benefit after AC for AJCC stage
I patients (n 5 73) in terms of median survival (158.8 vs
110.7 months; P 5 .226; HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.24-1.41)
or actuarial survival (84.0% vs 76.0% at 3 years and
52.0% vs 46.0% at 5 years; P 5 .255). There was no significant survival benefit from AC in stage II patients
(n 5 1003; median OS, 104.0 vs 79.6 months; P 5 .185;
HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72-1.07). There was no significant
difference in 3- (73.0% vs 73.0%) or 5-year actuarial sur696

vival (42.0% vs 36.0%; P 5 .492). AJCC stage III patients
who received AC (n 5 622) had significantly improved
OS in comparison with SA patients (n 5 599) in terms of
median survival (42.4 vs 26.1 months; P < .001; HR,
0.66; 95% CI, 0.58-0.77) and actuarial survival (55.0%
vs 41.0% at 3 years and 25.0% vs 17.0% at 5 years;
P < .001).
Because of the imbalance in tumor location between
the cohorts after propensity score matching, a survival
analysis was performed separately for the subset of duodenal and jejunoileal tumors. The survival benefit of AC for
AJCC stage III patients was observed for tumors located
in the duodenum (n 5 547; median OS, 34.1 vs 24.3
months; P 5 .002; HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.57-0.88) as well
as the jejunum and ileum (n 5 476; median OS, 52.6 vs
29.6 months; P 5 .003; HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55-0.89;
Fig. 3). Likewise, no significant improvements in OS
were observed for stage II patients who received AC,
regardless of the tumor location (n 5 255 for the duodenal group; median OS, 110.3 vs 75.5 months; P 5 .323;
HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.54-1.23; n 5 482 for the jejunoileal
group; median OS, 152.3 vs 88.1 months; P 5 .099; HR,

0.38-1.39; Fig. 4).
DISCUSSION
Using a large population-based registry of patients with
resected small bowel adenocarcinoma, the current study
indicates an improvement in OS with AC versus SA. The
absolute survival benefit was most pronounced in AJCC
stage III patients; nonsignificant improvements in survival
were observed for patients without nodal metastasis.
We observed increasing utilization of AC for small
bowel adenocarcinoma despite limited available data to
support this strategy. Although palliative chemotherapy
for metastatic disease may improve survival in patients
with small bowel adenocarcinoma,26-28 studies defining
its role in the adjuvant setting have been limited by small
sample sizes and a single-center design.11-14 In a retrospective analysis of patients who received chemotherapy,
radiotherapy, or chemoradiotherapy, Overman et al11
observed an improvement in OS for certain AJCC stage
III patients with a lymph node ratio > 0.1; however, the
inclusion of patients receiving radiotherapy made an
assessment of the impact of chemotherapy more difficult.
In the absence of data specific for small bowel adenocarcinoma, indications for AC have previously been extrapolated from colon cancer. This study confirms that
similarly to the treatment of adenocarcinoma of the large
intestine, adjuvant systemic chemotherapy improves survival for AJCC stage III patients. The use of AC for
resected AJCC stage II colon cancer patients, even for
those with poor prognostic clinicopathologic characteristics, remains controversial.29,30 Although consensus
guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology discourage the routine administration of AC for stage
II patients, a role in select high-risk patients has been suggested.31 Similarly, we failed to identify high-risk clinicopathologic features associated with a significant survival
advantage for AJCC stage II small bowel adenocarcinoma
patients receiving AC. The prognosis following a curative
resection for stage II disease is typically excellent; before
propensity score matching, we observed a median OS of
66.4 months for stage II patients managed with SA, and
this was similar to previously published data.2,32 Thus,
surgical resection is likely curative for many of these
patients, and any added benefit of AC must be weighed
against potential toxicities of treatment. Stage II patients,
including those with a T4 tumor classification or a
positive-margin resection, derived an absolute, though
not statistically significant, benefit.

Another notable finding of this study was the discrepancy between the tumor location and the receipt of
adjuvant systemic therapy. When analyzing OS by tumor location, we observed worse survival with duodenal
lesions versus jejunoileal lesions. A duodenal tumor
location has been associated with a poorer prognosis in
several other studies.2,5,33 Yet, in this national cohort of
patients, AC was less frequently used for tumors located
in the duodenum to such an extent that tumor location
was the only covariate that remained statistically unbalanced between the treatment arms after propensity score
matching. It is possible that the increased perioperative
morbidity associated with the more extensive resection
(ie, pancreaticoduodenectomy) for proximal duodenal
lesions may prohibit the timely initiation of adjuvant
therapy. Regardless, these results underscore opportunities for improvement in care whether through improved
surgical outcomes or the application of neoadjuvant
approaches.
Several limitations, particularly those inherent to
retrospective database analyses, warrant emphasis. First,
although extensive measures were undertaken to ensure
quality control, miscoding and data omission remain possibilities. Certain inadequacies of the database, namely,
the specific chemotherapeutics and dosing schedules, limited nuanced analyses of adjuvant therapy regimens.
Although this is speculative, it is likely that oxaliplatinbased regimens, with either infusional 5-fluorouracil or
capecitabine, were the predominant chemotherapeutics
used because of the support for these regimens in the literature.11,26 Also unavailable were medical comorbidity
data for all years of the study cohort, and this prohibited
inclusion of the Charlson comorbidity score as a variable
in the statistical models. The increased mortality observed
for patients who received care at academic centers may be
explained by referral patterns: more complex cases or
patients with more significant comorbidity may have been
referred to academic centers with the resources to care for
these patients. In addition, disease-specific mortality is
not captured by the NCDB; however, the majority of
patients in the propensity score–matched cohort were 65
years old or younger, and OS may closely parallel diseasespecific survival for these patients. Second, the results of
any observational cohort study are subject to the immortal
time bias: those patients who die before the initiation of
therapy are placed into the control arm, and this may exaggerate the apparent benefits seen in the treatment arm.
By excluding patients who died within the first 90 days after surgery, we attempted to minimize this bias. Moreover, the exclusion of patients who died within 90 days
699

Original Article

reduced the selection bias because this subgroup likely suffered early mortality from postoperative complications
unrelated to the cancer. Third, adequate lymph node examination has prognostic significance for many gastrointestinal malignancies, for which lymph node bench marks
have been proposed to ensure adequate staging.34-36
Moreover, in the case of colorectal cancer, patients with
stage II disease and inadequate lymph node staging are
considered to be high-risk patients who may benefit from
AC.31,37 Further efforts to define the optimal extent of
lymph node identification in small bowel adenocarcinoma patients are crucial before inadequate lymph node
assessment can be considered an indication for chemotherapy in node-negative patients.
In summary, these data support the use of AC for
patients with resected stage III small bowel adenocarcinoma. Future investigations, perhaps incorporating
genomic, proteomic, or immunologic predictors of
response, will help to identify stage I or II patients who
might benefit from multimodality therapy.
