ABSTRACT
Metadherin (MTDH) is identified as an oncogene in multiple cancers including
breast cancer, bladder cancer and endometrial cancer. However, the function of MTDH
in multiple myeloma (MM) is still unexplored. In this study, we disclose that MTDH
is an oncogene in MM. This is characterized by an elevation mRNA level of MTDH and
chromosomal gain of MTDH locus in MM cells compared to normal samples. Moreover,
MTDH expression significantly increased in MMSET translocation (MS) subgroup,
one of the high-risk subgroups in MM, and was significantly correlated with MM
patients’ poor outcomes in Total Therapy 2 (TT2) cohort. Further knockdown of MTDH
expression by shRNA in MM cells induced cell apoptosis, inhibited MM cells growth
in vitro and decreased xenograft tumor formation in vivo. Interestingly, opposite to
TT2, MM patients with high-MTDH expression showed favorable survival outcomes
in the TT3 cohort, while Bortezomib treatment was the major difference between
TT2 and TT3 cohort. Furthermore we proved that Bortezomib suppressed pre- and
post-transcription levels of MTDH expression of MM cells in vitro and in vivo. Finally,
our studies demonstrated that MTDH is a transcriptional gene of MMSET/NFκB /MYC
signaling in MM cells, which is inhibited by Bortezomib treatment.

MM, Shaughnessy JD Jr et al. categorized MM patients
into 8 subgroups based on Gene expression profiling
(GEP), including CD1 and CD2 subgroup with CCND1
and CCND3 translocation, hyperdiploidy (HY) group,
myeloid-like group (MY), low bone disease (LB) group,
MMSET/FGGR3 spike group (MS), MAF/MAFB (MF)
spike group and proliferation (PR) group [5, 6]. MF, MS
and PR subgroups comprised high-risk MM with worse
outcome than other 5 groups and were designated as
low-risk groups. To date, although the utility of novel

high-dose chemo-therapeutic reagents combining with
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) confer survival
advantage, MM patients still surfer from relapse and die
of MM eventually. Thus continued research to identify
innovative modes of action in MM and to develop its
specific inhibition method are still in urgent requirement.
Metadherin, also known as astrocyte elevated gene1 protein (AEG-1) or protein LYRIC, is a protein encoded
by the MTDH gene in humans. MTDH is significantly
amplified and acts as an oncogene in multiple cancers
including breast cancer [7], melanoma [8], malignant
glioma et al [9]. Increased MTDH promotes HRAS
induced tumor-promoting effects [10], facilitates breast
cancer metastasis [11], and activates NFκB transcription
through accumulating nuclear translocation of p65 in Hela
cells [12]. However the function of MTDH in multiple
myeloma (MM) is still not elucidated and requires further
exploration.
In this study, we first compared the MTDH
expression in MM cells with normal control cells,
classified MTDH expression in different MM subgroups,
and correlated MTDH with MM patient outcomes in TT2
and TT3 cohorts. We also discovered that Bortezomib
suppressed MTDH expression in both MM cell lines and
primary samples. Finally, we disclosed the mechanism by
which Bortezomib inhibited MTDH expression in MM.

Increased MTDH correlates with poor survival
in MM
To trace the role of MTDH in MM, we examined
MTDH expression in normal plasma (NP), monoclonal
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS,
a pre-MM disease) and myeloma cells using our gene
expression profiling (GEP) database [13]. Notably,
MTDH expression increased considerably from NP,
MGUS, to MM samples (p<0.0001, one-way ANOVA)
(Figure 1A). Further analysis of array-based comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) data collected from 115
MM patients revealed that the MTDH locus is frequently
amplified in these MM patient samples (Figure 1B) [14]
implying MTDH may also behave as a tumor-initiating
gene in MM. In addition, MTDH expression significantly
increased in the relapsed MM patients from Total Therapy
2 (TT2) cohort compared to newly diagnosed patients in
the same cohort (Figure 1C) [15]. Figure 1D confirmed
this and showed that increased MTDH was particularly
prevalent in the MMSET-activating translocations
subgroup (MS) compared to other 7 subgroups in TT2
cohort, which is one of the subgroups with the poorest
prognosis in MM (p<0.0001, one-way ANOVA, Fig. 1D)

[5]. To correlate with clinical parameters, MTDH
expression represented an independent factor associated
with characteristics like IgA isotype (p<0.05), hypodiploid
(p<0.05), and especially 1q21 amplification by FISH
analysis (p<0.01), which is acknowledged as a poor
diagnosed marker in MM (Table 1) [16]. Above all, MM
patients bearing high MTDH expression suffered poor
clinical outcomes relative to low-MTDH-expressing
patients in TT2 (Total Therapy 2) cohort and as shown in
Figure 1E and 1F elevated MTDH expression is linked to
significantly shorter response duration of both event free
(EF) and overall survival (OS) respectively. Thus we may
propose that MTDH acts as an oncogene in MM as well.

at protein level in MM cells transfected with MTDHshRNA (KD) compared to the control (Ctrl). To explore
the role of MTDH on MM cellular growth, cell numbers
of KD and Ctrl cells were counted daily using trypan blue.
After cultured for 5 days, MTDH-KD MM cells displayed
significantly lower cell growth rate compared to the Ctrl
cells in both CAG and XG1cells (Figure 2C). The growth
inhibition effect of MTDH was further confirmed by
colony formation assay. As shown in Figure 2D, significant
reductions of colony number were observed in MTDHshRNA transfected cells relative to its corresponding
control cells in the assay. The diminished growth rate of
MTDH-KD cells was attributed to the increased apoptotic
cell death detected by flow cytometry using Annexin V
antibody after MTDH-shRNA was transfected for 48h
(Figure 2E). The MTDH-shRNA induced apoptosis in
MM cells was also examined by western blot, in which
the intensity of cleaved PARP and Caspase 3 bands were
higher than the control cells (Figure 2F). These results
suggest MTDH expression is critical for promoting MM
cell growth in vitro.
To extend our findings to in vivo study, we
xenografted CAGKD and CAGCtrl cells subcutaneously into
the two-side flank NSG mice respectively (n = 5). Tumor
diameters were measured twice per week to evaluate the
growth rate of the CAGKD and CAGCtrl xenografts. In 5
of 5 cases, the tumors derived from CAGKD cells were
visibly smaller than their CAGCtrl counterparts (Figure
3A & 3B). The average weight of CAGKD tumors (0.42
g) was 37% lower than the control tumors (1.14 g;

Decreased MTDH expression induced MM cell
growth inhibition in vitro and in vivo
To determine MTDH functions as an oncogene/
driver gene in MM rather than a sequential phenomenon
based on previous data in Figure 1, we functionally
knocked down MTDH expression in MM cells by using
lentiviral shRNA transfection. Since MTDH is widely
expressed at the mRNA level in primary patient MM cells
indicated in Figure 1, we further confirmed its protein
expression by Western blot and found that all the 9 MM
cell lines ubiquitously expressed MTDH (Figure 2A).
Then we suppressed MTDH expression in CAG and XG1
cells by lentiviral shRNA particles. Immunoblotting was
recruited to verify the efficiency of shRNA. As shown in
Figure 2B, MTDH expression was remarkably decreased

available GEP datasets, we proved this hypothesis and
showed that MTDH expression in MM cells from 142
newly-diagnosed patients was significantly decreased
after Bortezomib treatment for 48h (PV) compared to
the corresponding MM cells collected before treatment
(BL) in the TT3 cohort (p=0.0121, (Figure 4C) [13, 18].
This result was stressed by study of Van Ness BG et al.,
in which they reported Bortezomib treatment consistently

four MM cell lines at two time points, 16h and 24h by
GEP [19] (Figure S1). We further verified the effect of
Bortezomib on MTDH expression in MM cell lines by
qPCR and western blot. MM cell lines, CAG and XG1,
were treated with 2nM Bortezomib and collected at 24h
and 48h after treatment. Compared to non-treatment
control cells, mRNA (Figure 4D) and protein level (Figure
4E) of MTDH were decreased by Bortezomib treatment
consistently. Xenograft tumors (n=3) from NSG mice
treated with Bortezomib or PBS control were dissected
and western blot was performed to examine MTDH
expression after Bortezomib treatment in vivo. Compared
to control tumors, Bortezomib-treated tumors comprised
reductive amounts of MTDH protein (Figure 4F). Our
results strongly support that Bortezomib suppresses
MTDH expression in MM.

MTDH expression was suppressed by
Bortezomib treatment in MM
MTDH was identified as oncogene in multiple
cancers including MM which denotes that MTDH is
an intriguing therapeutic target for cancer treatment,
nevertheless the MTDH inhibitors still await for further
investigation. In this study, we found that MTDH
expression showed similar distribution among the patients
in TT2 and TT3 cohorts, highest MTDH expression
in MMSET subgroup (Figure 4A), however, patients
with high MTDH expression in TT3 cohort displayed
contradictory outcomes compared to patients in the
TT2 cohort (Figure 4B), and enjoyed more optimistic
overall survival than low-MTDH-expressing patients.
As Bortezomib treatment is the major difference
between the TT2 [17] and TT3 [18] strategy of newly
diagnosed MM patients, we speculate that MTDH might
be a therapeutic target of Bortezomib. Using publicly

Bortezomb treatment suppresses MTDH
through MMSET/NFκB/MYC signaling pathway
in MM

(Figure 5B & 5C). Genetic interaction network of MTDH,
WHSC1/MMSET, NKκB and C-MYC was integrated and
generated with the help of the GeneMANIA online tool,
which predicts that MTDH is activated by NKκB and
C-MYC signaling pathway (Figure 5D).

To investigate the mechanism of Bortezomib
treatment suppressing MTDH expression in MM cells, we
evaluated the top 20 neighbors genes/probe sets that are
co-expressed with MTDH in the gene expression dataset
published by Carrasco DR et al [20] (Figure 5A). Among
the top 20 gene probe sets co-expressing with MTDH,
4 WHSC1/MMSET probe sets were listed suggesting
MTDH may be activated by MMSET transcription in
MM. This hypothesis was supported by the previous
finding that MTDH enriches significantly in MMSET
subgroups compared to other subgroups in both TT2
and TT3 cohorts. Then, we continued to query for the
signaling shared by MMSET and Bortezomib treatment
using Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA). We explored
the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB) gene
sets based on Scramble control vs MMSET-KD MM
cells dataset [22, 23] and MM cells before and after
Bortezomib treatment dataset respectively. Intriguingly,
we found that both knockdown of WHSC1/MMSET and
Bortezomib treatment in MM cells were highly related to
NFκB signaling and MYC signature in the GSEA analysis

MTDH is transcribed by MMSET/NFκB/MYC
signaling in MM
Microarray analysis revealed that knockdown
MMSET expression by shRNA remarkably reduced
MTDH expression, NFκB signaling, and MYC signature
genes described by the MSigDB gene sets in GSEA
(Figure 6A). MYC is also a downstream gene of NFκB
signaling according to the MSigDB gene sets and is
decreased by the MMSET shRNA as well. Then we
explored the chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing
(ChIP-Seq) database from the University of California
Santa Cruz (UCSC) for chromatin occupancy patterns
at the MTDH, which showed a significant footprint of
NFκB/P65 binding on the promoter region of MTDH in
10 of 10 B-lymphocytes. The promoter region of MTDH
was also occupied by MYC in multiple cancers including
Hela, MCF-7 et al. (Figure 6B) suggesting that NFκB/
MYC directly transcribes MTDH expression and promotes

worse survival than MTDH low-expressing patients in
both event free and overall survival (Figure 1E & 1F). To
further validate the role of MTDH in MM, we knocked
down MTDH expression in MM cell lines using lentiviral
shRNA and the results showed that decreased MTDH
induced MM cellular growth inhibition (Figure 2C),
clonogenicity reduction (Figure 2D), apoptosis in vitro
(Figure 2E & 2F) and tumorigenicity suppression in vivo
(Figure 3). This data was also supported by the finding that
the positive relation of MTDH with Ki67, and negative
correlation with Capase-3 by histology staining from other
cancers [24-27].
Based on these studies, we conclude that MTDH is
an oncogene in MM as well, which makes MTDH as an
attractive therapeutic target for MM. Inspiringly, contradict
to TT2 cohort, high MTDH expression is associated to
good outcome in TT3 cohort while Bortezomib treatment
is the major difference between both two cohorts (Figure
4B). Thus, we infer MTDH may be a therapeutic target for
Bortezomib. Further study proved this and showed that

DISCUSSION
In this study, we found increased MTDH expression
in MM cells compared to normal plasma control cells and
MGUS cells (Figure 1A) and chromosomal gain of MTDH
in most of MM patients by CGH array (Figure 1B).
Impressively, elevated MTDH expression was detected in
relapsed MM patients relative to newly diagnosed patients
(Figure 1C), and patients in MMSET subgroup, a high-risk
MM subgroup, bear the highest MTDH expression than
other 7 subgroups (Figure 1D) suggesting a poor outcome
of high MTDH expressing patients. More importantly,
patients with high MTDH expression suffered from

Bortezomb treatment inhibited MTDH expression in MM
cell lines in vitro (Figure 4D & 4E), in xenograft mice
(Figure 4F) and MM patients’ samples in vivo (Figure 4C).
To query the mechanism underlying the Bortezomib
treatment induced MTDH reduction, we explored
MTDH neighbor genes using Myeloma Portal, and
MMSET/WHSC1 was identified as the most relevant
gene with MTDH (Figure 5A). Chng WJ et al. reported
that Bortezomib reduced MMSET expression in MM
while MMSET directly bound with NFκB and promoted
NFκB transcription [21]. Moreover, GSEA analysis on
three independent database showed that both MMSETshRNA and Bortezomib treatment suppressed NFκB and
MYC signaling genes (Figure 5B) and Chip-seq analysis
from Santa Cruz revealed that MTDH is a downstream
gene of NFκB and MYC transcription in multiple cells
(Figure 6B). Therefore, we proposed that Bortezomib
reduced MTDH expression through inhibiting MMSET/
NFκB/MYC signaling cascade. We further validated this
proposal by treating MM cells with NFκB inhibitor, which
hindered MTDH expression in a time-dependent manner.
Chng WJ et al. also presented that Borbezomib treatment
decreased p65 in KMS11, KMS18 and KMS28BM MM
cells [21]. In addition, Bortezomib is also able to block
proteasome-dependent p100 conversion to p52 resulting
in inhibition of non-canonical NFκB activity suggesting
the importance of Bortezomib on NFκB signaling in MM.
Meanwhile MYC also transcribes MTDH expression and
stimulates oncogenetic activity in cancer cells including
MM. The oncogenetic activity of MYC is altered by
Bortezomib treatment to induce cancer cell death by
enhancing expression of the pro-apoptotic BCL2 family
members NOXA and BIM [33, 34].
In summary, we identified the oncogenetic function
of MTDH in MM and pointed out that Bortezomib was
a therapeutic reagent for MTDH through inhibiting
MMSET/NFκB/MYC transcription (Figure 6D). Our study
provided a preclinical framework for MTDH inhibition
derived from MM to other cancers.
