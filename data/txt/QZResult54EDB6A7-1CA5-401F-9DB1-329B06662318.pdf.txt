Abstract
How prostate cancer is initiated remains a topic of debate. In an effort to establish a human model of prostate
carcinogenesis, we adapted premalignant human prostate EPT2-D5 cells to protein-free medium to generate
numerous tight prostate spheres (D5HS) in monolayer culture. In contrast to EPT2-D5 cells, the newly generated
D5HS efﬁciently formed large subcutaneous tumors and subsequent metastases in vivo, showing the tumorigenicity of D5HS spheres. A striking production of interleukin (IL)-6 mRNA and protein was found in D5HS cells.
The essential roles of IL-6 and the downstream STAT3 signaling in D5HS tumor sphere formation were conﬁrmed
by neutralizing antibody, chemical inhibitors, and ﬂuorescent pathway reporter. In addition, elevated reactive
oxygen species (ROS) produced upon protein depletion was required for the activation of IL-6/STAT3 in D5HS.
Importantly, a positive feedback loop was found between ROS and IL-6 during tumor sphere formation. The
association of ROS/IL-6/STAT3 to the carcinogenesis of human prostate cells was further examined in xenograft
tumors and veriﬁed by limiting dilution implantations. Collectively, we have for the ﬁrst time established human
prostate tumor–initiating cells based on physiologic adaption. The intrinsic association of ROS and IL-6/STAT3
signaling in human prostate carcinogenesis shed new light on this relationship and deﬁne therapeutic targets in
this setting. Cancer Res; 73(23); 7090–100. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed malignancy among males in Western countries and is intimately
associated with aging (1). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) is
one of the major aging-associated inﬂuences on prostate
carcinogenesis (2). Although recent epidemiologic and clinical studies have linked prostate cancer risk and ROS, the
underlying mechanism remains to be elucidated (3).

In prostate cancer research, one of the big obstacles is the
lack of relevant preclinical models to understand the mechanism of human prostate carcinogenesis and to develop effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. In the past 40
years, several malignant transformations of human prostate
cells have been established by radiation (4) or chemical treatment, such as cadmium (5), N-nitroso-N-methylurea (6), or
introduction of virus elements (7). In patients, however, prostate cancer is unlikely to be caused by exposure to such strong
external carcinogens but is considered mainly a disease of
aging.
Previously, we have attempted to establish a prostate
carcinogenesis model based on physiologic selection and
adaption. We started with a human primary prostate basal
cell line EP156T that was derived from human prostate
benign tissue and immortalized using the human telomerase
catalytic subunit (hTERT; ref. 8). Subsequently, nonmalignant
mesenchymal EPT1 cells and premalignant EPT2-D5 cells
were derived from EP156T cells in a stepwise manner by
selection of cells with loss of contact inhibition and evasion
of quiescence, respectively (9, 10). EPT2-D5 cells showed
several in vitro malignant features such as colony formation
in soft agar, resistance to apoptosis, and independence of
exogenous growth factors. However, EPT2-D5 cells failed to
form xenograft tumors following repeated attempts (9), suggesting that additional change is needed to acquire full
malignant transformation.

ROS/IL-6/STAT3 and Prostate Carcinogenesis

Self-sufﬁciency in growth signals is a classic oncogenic
feature of cancer cells (11–13). No type of normal cell can
proliferate in culture without supplement of serum or growth
factors, whereas cancer cells invariably show greatly reduced
dependence on exogenous growth stimulation and uncontrolled proliferation (12, 13). In addition, chemically deﬁned
serum-free medium is widely used to enrich and culture tumorinitiating cells (TIC; refs. 14–16). In this work, we attempted to
obtain TICs by adapting EPT2-D5 cells in chemically deﬁned
medium without any protein component. Surprisingly, numerous tight prostate spheres were generated from single cells in
monolayer culture and efﬁciently established xenograft tumors.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
The prostate cell line EPT2-D5 was grown in MCDB153
medium (Biological Ind. Ltd.) supplemented with 1% Minimum Essential Media (MEM) nonessential amino acids solution, 200 nmol/L hydrocortisone, 10 nmol/L triiodothyronine, 5
mg/mL insulin, 5 mg/mL transferrin, 5 mg/mL sodium selenite,
100 ng/mL testosterone, 5 ng/mL EGF, 50 mg/mL bovine
pituitary extract (Invitrogen Life Sciences), 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS).
Prostate cancer PC3 and DU145 cell lines were grown in Ham's
F-12 medium and Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle's Medium
(DMEM; Lonza) containing 10% FCS, respectively. The medium was changed every 3 days. All the cell lines have been tested
and authenticated using forensic grade DNA microsatellite
analyses, karyotyping, and copy number analyses in parallel
with the experiments reported in this work. Lentiviral pGFSTAT3 reporter was a gift from Dr. Yong-Joon Chwae at Ajou
University School of Medicine, Korea. Interleukin (IL)-6 protein
(H7416) and chemical reagents cryptotanshinone (C5624),
FLLL31 (F9057), AG490 (T3434), N-acetyl-L-cysteine (A9165),
and melatonin (M5250) were products from Sigma-Aldrich. A
neutralizing antibody against IL-6 was from Abcam (ab6672).
Generation and passage of D5HS spheres
EPT2-D5 cells were seeded in T75 tissue culture ﬂasks (TPP)
to reach 30% conﬂuence. On the second day, the complete
medium was removed, and cells were washed twice with PBS
and cultured in basic Ham's F-12 medium (Lonza) without
serum and any other protein components (protein free medium). The medium was changed every 3 days. When the culture
reached conﬂuence, cells were trypsinized and the reaction
was quenched by soybean trypsin inhibitor (Invitrogen),
the cells were pelleted, resuspended, and split to 2 new ﬂasks.
The protein-free medium was changed every 3 days until the
spheres were generated about 2 weeks later. To passage the
prostate spheres, culture medium was collected in 15-mL
centrifuge tubes and kept at room temperature for 10 minutes
to let spheres settle down to the bottom of tubes. The upper
nine tenths of medium was gently removed, and the remaining
lower part contained most of the big spheres (>50 mm in
diameter) and was gently centrifuged at 1300  g for 2 minutes.
The pelleted spheres were dissociated enzymatically (0.05%
trypsin, 0.53 mmol/L EDTA) and mechanically (pipetting). The

www.aacrjournals.org

dissociated cells were analyzed microscopically for single
cellularity. The single cells were transferred to and attached
in new T75 tissue culture ﬂask. The protein medium was
changed every 3 days until new spheres again were generated
after around 10 days.
Measurement of ROS in cells
Cells were grown in complete medium or protein-free
medium. Production of ROS at various conditions or treatments was measured by incubation with membrane permeable
dye 20 ,70 -dichloroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCFDA; SigmaAldrich; ﬁnal concentration 1 mmol/L) for 10 minutes at 37 C.
The ROS levels in the cells were determined by ﬂuorescent
microscopy or measurement of the ﬂuorescence (excitation
500 and emission 520 nm) using AccuriC6 ﬂow cytometer
(Accuri Cytometers, Inc.).
ELISA
Expression levels of IL-6 in cell supernatants were determined using a commercial sandwich ELISA kit (Fisher Thermo
Scientiﬁc). Cells were cultured for 3 days and the medium was
harvested and centrifuged at 1300  g for 5 minutes. The
supernatant was used for determination of IL-6 levels according to the manufacturer's protocol.
Western blotting
The levels of expression and phosphorylation of STAT3
protein were determined by Western blotting following the
procedures described previously (10). All the antibodies used in
Western blotting were products of Abcam with the dilutions as
following: anti-phospho-speciﬁc STAT3 (Tyr705) (ab76315)
1:10,000; total STAT3 (ab119352) 1:4,000; endogenous control
b-actin (ab11003) 1:1,000.
DNA microarray
Total RNA was converted to Cy3-labeled cRNA targets and
hybridized to Agilent Whole Human Genome Microarrays 44k
(Cat.no. G4112F and G4845A, Agilent Technologies) according
to Agilent's instructions. Arrays were scanned using the Agilent
Microarray Scanner Bundle. Raw data were imported and
analyzed in J-Express software (Molmine, http://www.molmine.com). Mean spot signals were used as intensity measure,
the expression data were quantile normalized over the entire
arrays and log2-transformed. Differentially expressed genes
were identiﬁed using the feature subset selection (FSS) method. Only genes that changed more than 3.0 fold with P < 0.01
were considered as differentially expressed.
Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR
Reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR
(qPCR) were done as described (17). The TaqMan assays
used for quantiﬁcation of human IL-6 (Hs00985639_m1),
IL-6R (Hs00169842_m1), and b-actin (Hs99999903_m1) were
obtained from Applied Biosystems.
Mass spectrometric analysis
Proteins harvested from serum-free culture were digested
with trypsin and analyzed by mass spectrometry following a

protocol described previously (18). Details of mass spectrometric analysis are described in Supplementary Methods.
Xenograft tumor experiment
For subcutaneous tumor formation, BALB/c nude mice were
purchased from Shanghai Experimental Animal Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences and maintained under pathogenfree conditions. About 5  106 EPT2-D5 or D5H cells or 4  103
D5HS spheres were resuspended in 200 mL PBS and injected
subcutaneously into BALB/c nude mice. Five mice were used
for each cell type. The tumor was removed from sacriﬁced nude
mice when the diameter was about 70 mm. After mechanical
(cutting) and enzymatic (collagenase IV for 30 minutes at 37 C)
dissociation, the cells were suspended in Ham's F-12 medium
containing 5% FCS and plated in tissue culture ﬂasks. The
subcutaneous tumor experiment was approved by the Second
Military Medical University Committee on Animal Care.
For orthotopic xenograft tumor experiments, NOD/SCID
IL2rgnull mice (male, 6–10 weeks old, the Gade Institute,
University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway) were used and experiments were approved by the Norwegian Animal Research
Authority and conducted according to The European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrates Used for Scientiﬁc
Purposes. Bioluminescent EPT3 or EPT3-M1 cells were suspended in 50 mL PBS and injected in the left or right ventrolateral lobes of the prostate. Bioluminescence images were
conducted 10 minutes following administration of 150 mg/kg
D-luciferin (Promega) intraperitoneally. All Optix images were
acquired using Optix MX2 Time-Domain Molecular Imager
(ART Inc.). or In Vivo MS FX PRO (Carestream Health Inc.) as
previously described (19) or Kodak Molecular imaging software (Version 5.0 Carestream Health Inc).
Immunohistochemical examination
Mice were euthanized and sacriﬁced and tissues were collected by a certiﬁed veterinary. Tumor tissues were ﬁxed
in neutral-buffered 4% formaldehyde. Parafﬁn embedding,
preparation of sections, staining, and immunohistochemical
(IHC) examination were conducted using standard procedures. Brieﬂy, parafﬁn-embedded tissue slides were deparafﬁnized and processed for antigen retrieval using PTLink and
pretreatment buffer at pH 9.0 (Dako, DK, S2375) and 100 C for
20 minutes. Finished pretreated slides were washed in TBS.
Staining was conducted using speciﬁc antibodies and a single
staining rabbit/mouse kit (Dako Real Envision K5007) using
peroxidase/DABþ. Counter staining was carried out by a
hematoxylin staining kit. Histologic images were captured
using the Qcapture Suite software with a Qimaging Exi Blue
camera attached to a Leica DMRBE microscope. The following
primary antibodies and dilutions were used for antigen detection in IHC: AE1/AE3 (ab961, Abcam) prediluted; vimentin
(ab8545) prediluted; IL-6 (ab6672) 1:400; phospho-STAT3
Y705 (ab76315) 1:100; STAT3 (ab119352) 1:1,600; cyclin D1
(ab10540) 2 mg/mL, and human cell–speciﬁc anti-mitochondrion antibody (ab92824, 1:1,000). Inclusion of only the secondary and not the primary antibody in parallel provided
negative controls, in addition to differential staining of different neighboring tissue types in the sections.

Statistical analyses
Two-sample t tests were used for differences of sphere
formation, IL-6, or ROS levels between different groups.
ANOVA was used to identify the differentially expressed genes
in microarray data.
Microarray data accession number
The gene microarray data are accessible in database ArrayExpress (ID: E-MTAB-1521) according to MIAME guidelines.

Results
EPT2-D5 cells generated spheres in protein free medium
EPT2-D5 cells showed malignant features in vitro but failed
to form xenograft tumors (9). To further promote malignant
cells, we cultured EPT2-D5 cells in chemically deﬁned medium
without any protein components. Most EPT2-D5 cells can
survive well in protein-free medium, but the growth speed
was much slower than under standard culture conditions (9).
When cells were split to new ﬂasks after reaching conﬂuence,
cells kept growing in monolayer and surprisingly, multiple
tight and large spheres (>50 mm in diameter) were generated
and detached from the surface in 2 weeks (Fig. 1A and B). The
ﬂoating spheres were collected and dissociated to single cells
(Fig. 1C). These single cells attached efﬁciently to the surface
and expanded well in new tissue culture ﬂasks (Fig. 1D). New
spheres were visible again after 5 days and ﬂoating spheres
could be collected in 10 days (Fig. 1E and F). We named this
process attachment sphere cycles and the cells generating
these spheres D5HS (Fig. 1G). This D5HS cycle continued for
up to 1 year. The attachment of growing spheres to adherent
individual cells in monolayer culture showed that these
spheres were generated from single cells (Fig. 1H). The remaining cells in the ﬂask continued forming spheres for up to 3
months even when the ﬂoating spheres were harvested every
third day (Fig. 1I). This indicates that the spheres were indeed
generated by cell proliferation and not by cell aggregation and
the whole-cell population did not start to generate spheres
simultaneously. In the following study, all the D5HS spheres
used were newly generated (passage 2). When D5HS cells were
cultured in the presence of serum, cells grew only in monolayer
and no sphere was generated, showing the indispensability of
protein deprivation for sphere generation.
D5HS spheres initiated tumor growth in vivo
The formation of spheres is one important feature of TICs in
vitro (16). We tested the tumorigenicity of newly generated
D5HS by subcutaneous injection in BALB/c nude mice. As
controls, EPT2-D5 cells grown in complete medium (D5) and
EPT2-D5 cells that were adapted to protein-free medium for 3
days (D5H) were also injected in parallel. Signiﬁcantly, only
D5HS spheres efﬁciently formed large subcutaneous tumors
within 12 weeks (Fig. 2A), indicating the tumor initiation ability
of D5HS spheres (tumor spheres). Cells recovered from the
subcutaneous tumors were named EPT3. To obtain metastatic
tumors, luciferase-expressing EPT3 cells were inoculated
orthotopically into the prostate of mice. Large primary tumors
and extensive abdominal metastasis were found within 6
weeks (Fig. 2B). We conﬁrmed the human origin of the local

tumor and metastases by IHC staining using an antibody
speciﬁc for human mitochondrion (Supplementary Fig. S1).
Cells recovered from the primary tumor and the metastases
were named EPT3-PT1 and EPT3-M1, respectively. Thereby,
we have established a complete and stepwise model of prostate
carcinogenesis, which includes prostate primary epithelial
EP156T cells, mesenchymal nontransformed EPT1 cells, premalignant EPT2 cells, primary tumor derived EPT3-PT1, and
metastasis-derived EPT3-M1 cells (Fig. 2C). DNA microsatellite
analysis and copy number analysis veriﬁed their common
genetic origin and a stepwise increase of DNA aberrations in
these cells (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Data S1
and S2, and Supplementary Fig. S2). The phenotypes that were
acquired step by step in the model from EP156T to EPT3-M1
cells are summarized (Fig. 2D).
Activation of autocrine IL-6 in D5HS
To explore the mechanism of sphere formation, we proﬁled
the gene expression of newly generated D5HS using DNA microarrays (Supplementary Data S3). A number of growth factors and
cytokines were upregulated in D5HS (Fig. 3A and B). The top 1
increased (98-fold) growth factor gene IL-6 is particularly interesting, as it is a well-recognized marker of prostate cancer

www.aacrjournals.org

(20–22). The importance of its signaling pathway in D5HS
spheres is further supported by the increase of the IL-6
receptor (IL-6R; Supplementary Data S3). Real-time qPCR
veriﬁed the elevated transcription levels of both IL-6 and IL6R (Fig. 3C). At the protein level, proteomic analysis of the
secretome of the D5HS cells detected IL-6 and soluble IL-6
signal transducer IL-6ST (also known as gp130; Fig. 3D and
Supplementary Table S2), indicating that the IL-6 signaling
is indeed activated in D5HS. ELISA conﬁrmed up to 200-fold
higher IL-6 in the culture supernatant of D5HS than in EPT2D5 and D5H cells (Fig. 3E).
Elevation of IL-6/STAT3 activity was associated with
D5HS formation
To test whether elevation of IL-6 is important to sphere
formation, a neutralizing antibody against IL-6 was used to
treat sphere-forming D5HS cells. Signiﬁcant decrease of the
spheres in treated cells showed the requirement of IL-6 in
D5HS generation (Fig. 4A). STAT3 has been reported important
in IL-6-type signaling in prostate cancer (19–22). Activated
STAT3 signaling in D5HS was veriﬁed by Western blotting
using an antibody against phosphorylated (Y705) STAT3
(pSTAT3; Fig. 4B). Blockade of IL-6 reduced the pSTAT3 level,

showing IL-6-dependent activation of STAT3 in D5HS (Fig. 4C).
To track the STAT3 signaling activity, EPT2-D5 cells were
stably transduced with the ﬂuorescence (GFP)-based STAT3
pathway reporter pGF-STAT3. Very few cells expressing GFP
showed low activities of STAT3 signaling in EPT2-D5 and D5H
cells. A small but distinct subpopulation of GFP-positive cells
was found when EPT2-D5 cells started to form spheres in
protein-free medium (D5HS; Fig. 4D). Importantly, most of
these positive cells were dividing and tending to grow spheres
(Fig. 4E). In addition, some of the GFP positive cells divided into
one positive and one negative cell (Fig. 4F), suggesting asymmetric division that is a hallmark of self-renewal of cancer stem
cells (CSC; ref. 23). D5HS cells with top high (STAT3high) and
bottom low (STAT3low) levels of STAT3 activities were isolated

using ﬂow cytometry and sphere formation in STAT3high cells
was much higher than in STAT3low cells (Fig. 4G). STAT3
inhibitors signiﬁcantly reduced the sphere formation in D5HS
cells (Fig. 4H), showing the critical role of the STAT3 signaling
in D5HS sphere formation. However, the IL-6 level in the
supernatant was not signiﬁcantly affected by these STAT3
inhibitors (Fig. 4I), suggesting that the activation of STAT3 is
IL-6-dependent but the activation of IL-6 is not caused by
STAT3 signaling activity.
High ROS status was required for IL-6/STAT3 activation
in D5HS spheres formation
It has been reported that IL-6/STAT3 signaling can be
activated by ROS (24) and that ROS can be generated during

serum deprivation (25). To test the possibility that the activation of IL-6/STAT3 in D5HS is due to ROS induced by growth
factor withdrawal, endogenous ROS were detected using redox
sensitive dye DCFDA. As presented in Fig. 5A, very few and
weak signals were detected in EPT2-D5 cells growing in
complete medium, whereas signals were signiﬁcantly stronger
(5-fold) when cells were adapted in protein free medium for 3
days (D5H; Fig. 5A and B). Strikingly, even higher (24-fold) ROS
level was found in D5HS (Fig. 5A and B). Treatment of D5HS
cells with anti-oxidants N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) and melatonin signiﬁcantly reduced DCFDA levels (Fig. 5C), showing
that ROS indeed were induced in EPT2-D5 cells upon growth
factor withdrawal. Similar to STAT3-positive cells, heterogeneous intensities of ROS were found among D5HS cells and
most cells with higher ROS status tended to generate spheres
(Fig. 5A). D5HS cells with top high and bottom low ROS levels
were isolated and named ROShigh and ROSlow cells, respectively. Signiﬁcantly, ROShigh cells generated numerous spheres,
whereas ROSlow cells continuously grew in monolayer without
sphere formation even at day 18 (Fig. 5D and E). Treatment of
ROShigh cells with antioxidants NAC and melatonin efﬁciently
decreased the sphere numbers (Fig. 5E), showing the indispensable role of ROS in D5HS formation. Examination of
secreted IL-6 showed much higher IL-6 in ROShigh cells than in
ROSlow cells (Fig. 5F), and the IL-6 level in ROShigh cells can be
repressed by NAC and melatonin (Fig. 5F), indicating the
requirement of ROS for IL-6 activation in D5HS sphere formation. Consistently, higher STAT3 phosphorylation was
found in ROShigh cells than in ROSlow cells (Fig. 5G), and the
level can also be reduced by antioxidant melatonin (Fig. 5G). All
these data showed the requirement of ROS for spheres formation and IL-6/STAT3 activation.

It has been reported that ROS were induced in a few hours
upon serum starvation and the level was relatively stable or
lower afterwards (24). The much higher (4.8-fold) ROS level in
D5HS than in D5H cells suggested an additional factor inducing
ROS in D5HS (Fig. 5A and B). We tested whether it was due to
the highly activated IL-6 considering that cytokines can stimulate intracellular ROS (26). As expected, the ROS level in D5HS
was reduced (1.7-fold) by neutralizing antibody against IL-6
(Fig. 5H), and conversely, adapting EPT2-D5 cells in protein-free
medium containing IL-6 protein at 2 ng/mL induced signiﬁcant
higher (2.1-fold) ROS level than control cells (Fig. 5I), indicating
a positive feedback loop between ROS and IL-6 in D5HS
formation. A ROS/IL-6/STAT3 regulation cascade in prostate
tumor sphere formation is consequently proposed (Fig. 5J).
IL-6/STAT3 signaling deﬁned TICs in the EPT3 tumor
model
To evaluate the IL-6/STAT3 signaling activity in EPT3
tumor formation in vivo, the expression of IL-6 and STAT3,
as well as a putative STAT3 target cyclin D1, were examined in
the xenograft tumors by IHC staining. Clear staining of IL-6
with a pericellular and patchy intercellular pattern was
detected in both primary and metastatic tumors (Fig. 6A).
pSTAT3 was detected in the nuclei of a small proportion of
prostate tumor cells (Fig. 6A). Total STAT3, on the other hand,
stained the cytoplasm of a larger proportion of cells in
addition to several nuclei (Fig. 6A). Nuclear staining of cyclin
D was evident in a proportion of cells (Fig. 6A), all together
indicating activation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in the EPT3
primary tumor and metastasis.
Autocrine IL-6 and phosphorylation of STAT3 were also
measured in EPT3 tumor–derived EPT3-PT1 and -M1 cells. The

levels of secreted IL-6 in both cell lines were in the same range
as for D5HS cells and more than 200-fold higher than in EPT2D5 cells (Fig. 6B). The autocrine effect of IL-6 in EPT3 tumor–
derived cells was extremely high considering that these cells
were cultured in complete medium without the cell stress
experienced by D5HS cells due to protein depletion. Consistently, ROS level in EPT3-M1 cells was also much higher (5-fold)
than in EPT2-D5 cells (Fig. 6C and D). In addition, antioxidant
melatonin efﬁciently blocked the production of IL-6 in EPT3M1 cells (Fig. 6E), indicating that the high level of IL-6 in EPT3
tumors is due to high endogenous ROS, the same as in D5HS.

Discussion
In this work, we have generated prostate TICs via adapting
premalignant EPT2 cells in protein-free medium. Chemically
deﬁned serum-free medium is widely used to culture tumor
spheres or TICs (14–16). However, these media are often
supplemented with growth factors such as EGF and ﬁbroblast
growth factor (FGF), and all cells are cultured in nonadherent
conditions (14–16). In the current study, EPT2-D5 cells efﬁciently generated tumor spheres in medium completely free of
serum or any other growth factor, suggesting an even higher
independence of exogenous growth stimulation. In addition,
generation of D5HS spheres from single adherent cells provides
a unique model to study the cell division and metabolism of
TICs.

www.aacrjournals.org

Although ROS and cellular oxidant stress have long been
associated with cancer, and elevated ROS level is a hallmark
of many highly invasive cancers (29, 30), there is a hypothesis
that keeping ROS levels low within stem cells or TICs is an
important feature of "stemness" and offers protection against
the cell toxicities of ROS (31, 32). Recent studies suggest that
ROS not only are byproducts of cellular metabolism but also
play roles as second messengers in cell signaling (33). In this
work, high ROS level is indispensable to tumor sphere formation, autocrine activity of IL-6, and activation of STAT3 signaling, showing the central role of ROS as second messenger
in tumor initiation. The different requirements of ROS in
stem cells and D5HS cells may due to their different status:
the relatively quiescent state of stem cells under normal
circumstances is in contrast to the uncontrolled proliferation
of tumor spheres with high ROS status advantageous for high
proliferation. Similarly, high ROS supported proliferation, selfrenewal, and neurogenesis of neural stem and progenitor

cells (34), suggesting the context-dependent and complex
function of ROS in stem cells and TICs. Actually, tumor spheres
and TICs were usually maintained in serum-free medium
in vitro (14–16). The absence of serum inevitably induces high
ROS status in these cultures, which indicates that higher ROS
level is common in tumor spheres and TICs.
IL-6 is elevated in the sera of patients with metastatic
prostatic cancer and it is a widely recognized marker of
prostate cancer (20–22, 35). Extensive studies have shown
the central role of STAT3 in IL-6-type cytokine signaling in
prostate cancer (27, 28, 36). Using a STAT3 reporter, we
found that the IL-6-dependent STAT3-positive cells are

enriched in tumor sphere–forming cells, and the top
STAT3-positive cells isolated from xenograft tumors showed
much stronger tumorigenicity than negative control cells in
vivo, showing the essential role of IL-6/STAT3 activity in
prostate tumor initiation. The central role of IL-6 in tumor
initiation is also found in recent reports on prostate and
breast cancer. Expression of IL-6 is much higher in prostate
CSCs than non–stem cancer cells (NSCC) and NSCCs can
be converted to CSCs by IL-6 treatment (37). Although
these prostate CSCs were deﬁned by cell surface markers
CD44þ/CD133þ (37), whereas our prostate TICs were deﬁned by the activity of STAT3 signaling, both showed high

dependence on IL-6. Activation of an IL-6 inﬂammatory loop
is required for expanding the trastuzumab-resistant breast
CSC population (38). However, it should be noted that other
pathways or factors are also important to the D5HS generation and tumor initiation as not all the sphere-forming cells
scored positive for STAT3 signaling (Fig. 4G) and chemical
blockade of STAT3 signaling did not abolish all sphere
formation (Fig. 4H), and ﬁnally, STAT3low cells still generated tumors even though many more cells were needed (Fig.
6H). It will be interesting to evaluate the roles of other
growth factors and cytokines that were also signiﬁcantly
increased in D5HS, such as bone morphogenetic protein
(BMP), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), TGFBs,
VEGFs, IL8, and IL33 (Fig. 3A and B).
As discussed above, there are abundant epidemiologic and
clinical studies indicating the correlation of prostate cancer to
ROS and IL-6/STAT3 signaling, respectively. In this study, for
the ﬁrst time, we linked an intrinsic association of ROS and IL6/STAT3 in prostate carcinogenesis, which allows an improved
therapeutic strategy regarding prostate cancer. Importantly,
we observed a positive feedback loop between ROS and IL-6
during prostate tumor sphere formation. Induction of IL-6 by
ROS was previously reported in many contexts (39–41). The
mechanisms involved were transcriptional activation of the IL6 gene through an NF-kB–dependent pathway (39, 40) or
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity (41). On the
other hand, IL-6 has been reported to induce ROS by activating
the transcription and enzyme activity of spermine oxidase
(SMO), which oxidizes spermine into spermidine, 3-aminopropanal, and H2O2 (42). Spermine can also be ﬁrst acetylated by
spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SAT) and then
oxidized by N1-acetylpolyamine oxidase (APAO), producing
H2O2 as a byproduct (42). The expression of the SAT gene is
signiﬁcantly (5.5-fold) increased in D5HS (Supplementary Data
S3), which can be a potential mechanism of the induction of
ROS by IL-6 in D5HS.
