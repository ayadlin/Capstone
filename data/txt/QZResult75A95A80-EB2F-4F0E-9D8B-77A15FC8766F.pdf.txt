Abstract

Author Manuscript

Although the effects of VEGF on angiogenesis and vascular function are well known, the effects
of VEGF on tumor cell function remain to be elucidated. We studied phenotypic changes in
human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells with homozygous deletion of VEGF alleles to determine the
potential direct role of VEGF on tumor cell function. Loss of VEGF expression led to significantly
decreased cell growth and increased spontaneous apoptosis in CRC cells (p<0.01). Loss of VEGF
also increased the in vitro sensitivity of cells to the cytotoxic effects of the chemotherapeutic drug
5-fluorouracil, as shown by increased apoptosis (p<0.05). These effects were mediated via
upregulation of the proapoptotic mediators caspase-3, cleaved PARP and Bax and downregulation
of the pro-survival mediator survivin. Our findings suggest a novel and distinct function of VEGF
in mediating autocrine/intracrine CRC cell survival.

Introduction
Author Manuscript

Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A, or simply VEGF) was originally identified
as a ‘permeability factor’ and was later shown to also mediate endothelial cell proliferation
(Connolly et al., 1989; Leung et al., 1989; Senger et al., 1983; Senger et al., 1986). VEGF is
the prototypical member of a family of VEGF ligands that includes placental growth factor

(PlGF) and VEGFs A–E (Ferrara et al., 2003; Houck et al., 1991; Tischer et al., 1991).
VEGF expression is upregulated in the majority of human tumors, and its expression is
inversely associated with survival. Standard models of VEGF biology focus on tumor cell
secretion of VEGF, whereby it acts in a paracrine manner to attract and stimulate
proliferation of endothelial cells (reviewed in (Brown et al., 1997)). It has since been shown
that VEGF can also mediate a protective/survival effect on a number of cell types, including
endothelial cells, embryonic stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells (Ferrara et al., 1996;
Gerber et al., 2002; Gerber et al., 1998). In addition, recent studies have shown that VEGF
acts as an autocrine/paracrine growth and survival factor for tumor cells that express VEGF
receptor (Bachelder et al., 2001; Barr et al., 2008; Calvani et al., 2008; Dias et al., 2002;
Pidgeon et al., 2001; Santos & Dias, 2004; Vincent et al., 2005).

Our laboratory previously demonstrated that expression of the VEGFR-1 receptor by
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells mediates cell motility and invasion (Fan et al., 2005). The
presence of VEGF receptors on CRC cells led us to hypothesize that VEGF has a direct
effect on tumor cell function that may contribute to tumor cell survival. However,
preliminary studies in our laboratory with the use of VEGF-neutralizing antibodies did not
lead to changes in cell survival. Therefore, we sought to understand the role and mechanism
of intracrine VEGF signaling in CRC. In this report, we demonstrate that loss of intracrine
VEGF signaling leads to an increase in spontaneous apoptosis and chemosensitivity. These
findings have implications for a better understanding of mechanisms of action (or lack
thereof) of VEGF-targeted therapies when combined with chemotherapy in patients with
metastatic CRC.

Results

Loss of autocrine VEGF decreases growth of CRC cells
To determine the role of autocrine VEGF in CRC cell growth and survival, we used two
pairs of isogenic CRC lines in which the VEGF gene was disrupted. HCT116/VEGF−/− and
LS174T/VEGF−/− cells were generated by homologous recombination–mediated deletion of
the VEGF alleles as described previously (Dang et al., 2006). The loss of VEGF expression
in the VEGF−/− cells was confirmed by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure 1A,
VEGF expression was undetectable in conditioned medium from HCT116/VEGF−/− and
LS174T/VEGF−/− cells compared with expression in the corresponding parental cells.

Author Manuscript

To determine the biological effect of loss of autocrine/intracrine VEGF on CRC cells in
vitro, we first assessed cell growth using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. To exclude the effects of exogenous VEGF (fetal bovine
serum (FBS)–derived), the cells were grown for the assay under low-serum (1%) conditions.
As shown in Figure 1B, loss of VEGF expression led to significant inhibition in cell growth
compared with the control at days 2 and 3 in HCT116 cells (top panel, p< 0.01) and at days
1, 2 and 3 in LS174T cells (bottom panel, p< 0.01). Since decreased cell number could result
from a combination of deregulated cell proliferation and cell death, we investigated, using
propidium iodide (PI)/fluorescence-activated cell-sorting (FACS) analysis, whether loss of
VEGF affected cell cycle progression in the cells. As shown in Figure 2A, cell cycle
analysis revealed a significantly higher percentage of HCT116/VEGF−/− cells (12.3% ±

0.8%) with sub-G0/G1 DNA content, compared with parental cells (6.1% ± 0.4%, p =
0.002) (Figure 2A); these results represent the mean ± standard error of three independent
experiments). A similar trend was observed in the LS174T/VEGF−/− cells, although the
difference was not statistically significant.
Loss of VEGF increases spontaneous apoptosis in CRC cells

Author Manuscript

Having observed decreased survival of the VEGF−/− cells, we sought to determine whether
this result was due to an increase in spontaneous apoptosis. HCT116/VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/−
cells were grown under low-serum conditions for 48h, stained with Annexin V/FITC and
analyzed by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 2B, there was a significant increase in the
spontaneous apoptotic rate of the HCT116/VEGF−/− cells (17.2% ± 0.6%) compared with
VEGF+/+ cells (11.5 ± 0.7%, p = 0.004). The Annexin V assay could not be performed on
the LS174T cells because these cells tend to grow in clumps and require extensive
trypsinization and manipulation to obtain a single-cell suspension; these processes damage
the membranes of the cells and cause nonspecific binding of the dye, resulting in falsepositive staining.
To determine whether the increased rate of spontaneous apoptosis in the VEGF−/− cells
could be overcome by the addition of exogenous VEGF-A, HCT116 VEGF−/− cells were
grown in serum-reduced medium (1% fetal calf serum) and stimulated with VEGF-A for 24
hr. Cells were then stained with Annexin V/FITC and analyzed by flow cytometry.
However, this treatment did not rescue the rate of spontaneous apoptosis in the VEGF−/−
cells, suggesting an intracrine function of VEGF (data not shown).

Author Manuscript

To examine the mechanism by which loss of VEGF contributes to increased spontaneous
cell death, we analyzed the VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− CRC cells for expression of apoptotic
mediators. The caspases are key mediators of apoptosis (Cohen, 1997; Cryns & Yuan,
1998). Caspase 3, the effector caspase in the apoptotic cascade, is activated through
cleavage by caspase-9 as a result of an increase in mitochondrial permeability and release of
cytochrome C. Cleaved caspase 3 was assessed by western blot analysis. As shown in Figure
2C, we noticed an increased level of cleaved caspase-3 in the VEGF−/− cells. In addition, we
observed increased constitutive expression of the proapoptotic protein Bax and decreased
expression of the pro-survival factor survivin in the VEGF−/− cells (Figure 2C).
Loss of autocrine VEGF increases the chemosensitivity of CRC cells to 5-fluorouracil

Author Manuscript

Since loss of VEGF led to an increase in spontaneous cell death and apoptosis, we
investigated whether it would also affect cells’ response to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as
5-fluorouracil (5FU). Treatment with a clinically relevant dose of 5FU significantly
decreased survival of both HCT116/VEGF−/− and LS174T/VEGF−/− cells compared with
survival of the parental cells. As shown in Figure 3A, we observed a significantly higher
percentage of dead cells among 5FU-treated HCT116/VEGF−/− cells (23.2% vs. 7.5%,
p<0.05) and LS174T/VEGF−/− cells (24.8% vs. 8.0%, p<0.05) than among parental cells.
To further validate the above-described findings, HCT116/VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells
treated with 5FU for 48h were stained with Annexin V/FITC and analyzed by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figure 3B, there was a significant increase in the 5FU-induced

apoptotic rate of the HCT116/VEGF−/− cells (11.1% ± 0.6%) compared with the VEGF+/+
cells (4.8 ± 0.6%, p=0.004).

Author Manuscript

To confirm the mechanism of 5FU-induced cell death, we compared the activation of
apoptotic mediators in the VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− CRC cells treated with 5FU. The
cleavage of caspase-3 and PARP, were assessed by immunoblotting using antibodies that
specifically recognize their cleaved products. Consistent with the increased apoptosis in the
5FU-treated VEGF−/− cells, we observed a marked increase in the levels of active caspase-3
in these cells (Figure 3C). PARP is cleaved by activated caspase-3, and since PARP
cleavage is the signature event in apoptosis, we rationalized that analysis of cleaved PARP
level should indicate an increase in spontaneous apoptosis in the VEGF−/− cells. Both
HCT116/VEGF−/− and LS174T/VEGF−/− cells were found to have increased PARP
cleavage following 5FU treatment compared with parental cells. To further confirm the
specificity of 5FU-induced apoptosis in VEGF−/− cells, we analyzed the activation of PARP
in these cells in response to increasing concentration of 5FU. As shown in Figure 3D,
HCT116/VEGF−/− cells demonstrated a dose-dependent increase in PARP cleavage when
treated with increasing concentrations of 5FU.
To further validate these findings in an alternate system using an additional knockout/
knockdown approach, we transiently downregulated VEGF expression in HCT116/VEGF+/+
cells using VEGF specific siRNA. As shown in Supplementary figure 1, treatment with 5FU
led to a marked increase in the levels of the apoptotic markers, cleaved caspase 3 and
cleaved PARP and decrease in level of antiapoptotic protein, surviving, in the siVEGF-A
cells compared to siControl cells.

Author Manuscript

To examine the effect of VEGF loss on apoptosis in vivo, we stained xenograft tissue
samples derived from HCT116/VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− CRCcells for cleaved caspase 3.
Tumors derived from VEGF−/− cells exhibited more cleaved caspase 3 positive cells
compared to the VEGF+/+ derived tumors.
Intracrine VEGF regulates CRC cell survival

Author Manuscript

To further explore the mechanism of VEGF signaling–mediated survival in these cells, we
examined the receptor status of the cells. Transcripts corresponding to VEGFR-1,
VEGFR-2, NRP-1 and NRP-2 were detectable by reverse transcription (RT)–PCR analysis
in both cell lines (Figure 4A). However, only VEGFR-1, NRP-1 and NRP-2 were detected at
the protein level by western blot analysis in both cell lines. We did not detect VEGFR-2
protein in these cell lines by western blot analysis even after repeated efforts using several
different antibodies to the protein. The fact that VEGFR-2 transcripts were detected (albeit
at very low levels) in these cells suggests that perhaps the VEGFR-2 transcripts are
relatively unstable or translated at very low levels (below the threshold for detection by
western blot) in these cells. VEGFR-3 was undetectable by both RT-PCR and western blot
analysis in these cells. No significant differences were noted in the expression of the
receptors between the VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells.
To examine the effect of VEGF loss on VEGFR1 receptor activation status, we used
immunoblot analysis to examine VEGFR1 receptor phosphorylation. As shown in Figure

4B, there was a marked increase in VEGFR1 phosphorylation in the VEGF−/− cells
compared to parental cells. To determine whether the changes in VEGFR1 phosphorylation
observed in the VEGF−/− cells had resulted from potential changes in ligand expression, we
next examined the levels of PlGF, a known ligand for VEGFR-1, in these cells. PlGF level,
as determined by ELISA, was significantly higher in the VEGF−/− compared to parental
cells suggesting that absence of intracrine VEGF survival signaling in CRC cells results in
the activation of a compensatory pathway mediated through the PlGF/VEGFR1 axis.

Author Manuscript

To gain further insight into the role of autocrine VEGF signaling in mediating survival of
CRC cells, we compared the effect of loss of VEGF expression (intracellular and secreted,
as in the case of the VEGF−/− cells) and that of extracellular inhibition of VEGF (with a
blocking antibody) on spontaneous cell death in HCT116 and LS174T cells. HCT116 and
LS174T cells were incubated in the presence of bevacizumab (a monoclonal anti-VEGF
antibody) for 48h at 37°C, stained with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry. Treatment with
bevacizumab had no significant effect on the rate of spontaneous cell death in either cell line
(Figure 4C). To further dissect the autocrine VEGF signaling pathway, we studied the
induction of spontaneous cell death in HCT116 and LS174T cells following treatment with
SU5416, an intracellular inhibitor of VEGF receptor activation. PI/FACS analysis revealed
no significant change in the rate of apoptosis in either cell line following treatment with
SU5416 (Figure 4D), suggesting that VEGFR-1 kinase activity does not mediate survival of
VEGF−/− cells.

Discussion

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In contrast to the role of tumor-derived VEGF in mediating the functions of endothelial cells
in the tumor microenvironment, relatively little is known regarding the role of autocrine/
intracrine VEGF signaling in tumor cells. An increasing body of evidence supports the
notion that VEGF has a direct effect on tumor cells, acting as a growth and survival factor
(Bachelder et al., 2001; Barr et al., 2008; Calvani et al., 2008; Dias et al., 2002;
Lichtenberger et al., 2010; Pidgeon et al., 2001; Santos & Dias, 2004; Vincent et al., 2005).
In a recent study, Lee et al (Lee et al., 2007b) reported that VEGF functions as an internal
autocrine survival factor in human breast cancer cells through internally expressed
VEGFR-1. Additionally, Masuda et al (Masuda et al., 2008) reported a novel function of the
5′-UTR of vegf mRNA in growth and survival of CRC cells. Lichtneberger et al. recently
showed that epidermis-specific Flt1 deletion also impairs tumorigenesis and proliferation of
skin tumors (Lichtenberger et al., 2010). These reports and the presence of a functional
VEGF receptor in CRC cells (demonstrated previously by our laboratory (Fan et al., 2005))
led us to hypothesize that autocrine/intracrine VEGF has an essential growth/survival
function in CRC cells.
In this study, using two VEGF-deficient human CRC cell lines generated by genetic
deletion, we demonstrate that VEGF is a survival factor for human CRC cells. In vitro,
VEGF-deficient cells displayed decreased cell viability and increased rates of spontaneous
apoptosis when grown under low-serum conditions, a form of stress. We further demonstrate
that loss of VEGF increased the susceptibility of CRC cells to apoptosis caused by 5FU
treatment. Consistent with these findings, western blot analysis demonstrated upregulation

of several pro-apoptotic mediators. Treatment of CRC cells with bevacizumab, an antiVEGF antibody (that acts exclusively on secreted/extracellular VEGF), did not affect cell
survival, suggesting an intracrine survival function of VEGF in these cells. Additionally,
treatment of the CRC cells with an intracellular suppressor of VEGF tyrosine kinase
receptor activation, SU5416, did not affect cell survival, suggesting that the VEGF-mediated
survival function in these cells is independent of kinase activity. It is possible that VEGF
may bind to the non-kinase receptors neuropilin-1 or neuropilin-2 to mediate it’s
intracellular survival effects. Although PlGF was elevated in the VEGF−/− cells, it was
unable to compensate for the loss of VEGF in these cells, suggesting again that the kinase
activity of VEGFR-1 does not mediate survival signals in CRC cells.

Author Manuscript

While our studies have focused on function of intracrine VEGF signaling in mediating
survival of CRC cells, the precise mechanisms by which VEGF mediates survival of CRC
cells remain to be elucidated. In the case of endothelial cells, there is evidence for several
mechanisms, including the induction of Bcl-2 (Nor et al., 2001) and interactions with
integrins (Hutchings et al., 2003). Evaluation of the receptor status of the CRC cells revealed
the expression of mRNA corresponding to both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2; however, only
VEGFR-1 protein was detectable by western blot analysis, indicating that VEGFR-1 is the
predominant VEGF tyrosine kinase receptor in these cells.

Author Manuscript

VEGF is one of the few genes where heterozygous knockout is embryonic lethal due to
vascular abnormalities (Carmeliet et al., 1996; Ferrara et al., 1996), and thus held great
promise as a therapeutic target. Although VEGF targeting has been shown to be a very
effective therapeutic strategy in certain tumor types, such as renal cell carcinoma (Escudier
et al., 2009; Rini et al., 2008), the overall benefit of blocking VEGF activity in other solid
malignancies is marginal and has led to some skepticism in the field. However,
understanding the ubiquitous role of VEGF intracrine signaling may provide new
opportunities for targeting this protein, which is not only an angiogenic factor, but also an
intracrine survival factor for both tumor cells (our study) and endothelial cells (Lee et al.,
2007a). Newer technologies, such as siRNA therapeutics, may provide new opportunities to
improve upon current VEGF targeted therapies.
Our study reveals a novel role of autocrine VEGF in mediating survival of CRC cells. These
studies suggest that strategies to block VEGF signaling based on agents that neutralize
VEGF (bevacizumab) or inhibit its receptors (kinase inhibitors) may not have a direct effect
on tumor cells, but other methods that decrease or ablate intracellular VEGF may provide
new therapeutic opportunities to exploit VEGF-dependent survival of these cells.

to manufacturer’s instructions. The efficiency of VEGF knockdown in culture supernatant
was assessed after 48 hr of incubation by western blot analysis. To test chemosensitivity, the
cells were further incubated without or with 5FU for additional 48 hours and expression of
apoptotic and antiapoptotic markers were assessed by western blot analysis.
Immunohistochemical staining of in vivo tumor tissue

Author Manuscript

Male athymic nude mice (6 – 8 weeks old) were purchased from the National Cancer
Institute – Frederick Cancer Research Facility (Frederick, MD) and maintained under
specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal experiments met the requirements of the
MDACC Animal Care Facility, IACUC, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)
guidelines on animal care. 1.0 × 106 HCT-116 VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− were injected in 0.1
mL of Hanks balanced salt solution per mouse subcutaneously (right rear flank). Tumor
growth was monitored and mice were killed by CO2 asphyxia when tumors were
approximately 1 cm in diameter. The VEGF−/− tumors were harvested about 30 days after
the VEGF+/+ tumors so that they were of similar size at the time of harvest. The excised
tumors were fixed in formalin. Paraffin embedded tissue specimens of VEGF+/+ and
VEGF−/− tumors were IHC stained for cleaved caspase 3.
Statistical analyses

Figure 1. Effect of loss of VEGF expression on proliferation of CRC cells

Author Manuscript

A. Loss of VEGF expression in CRC cells with deletion of VEGF alleles. VEGF-A levels in
conditioned medium from HCT116 and LS174T VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells were
determined by western blot analysis. VEGF-A expression was undetectable in the VEGF−/−
cells. Equalproteinloading of the gels was verified by Ponseu-S staining of the membranes.
B. The growth rates of HCT116 and LS174T VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells were assessed in
terms of absorbance at 570 nm in an MTT assay. VEGF−/− cells showed significantly
reduced proliferative activity compared with VEGF+/+ cells.

Author Manuscript

A. Loss of VEGF expression led to increased spontaneous cell death. Cells were grown in
1% FBS medium for 48h, fixed and stained with PI. Cell death was assessed by flow
cytometry. B. Increased spontaneous apoptosis in HCT116 VEGF−/− cells. Cells were grown
in 1% FBS medium for 48h, and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry following
Annexin V staining. C. Altered expression of apoptotic mediators in VEGF−/− cells. Wholecell lysates of cells growing in 1% FBS medium for 48h were collected and analyzed for
expression of caspase 3, cleaved caspase-3, bax and survivin by western blot analysis. Actin
served as a loading control.

Figure 3. Effect of loss of VEGF expression on chemosensitivity and signaling in CRC cells

Author Manuscript

A. Increased chemosensitivity of VEGF−/− cells to 5FU treatment. HCT116 and LS174T
VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells growing in 1% FBS medium were treated without or with 5FU
for 48h, fixed and stained with PI; cell death was then assessed by flow cytometry. B. 5FU
treatment led to increased apoptosis in HCT116 VEGF−/− cells. HCT116 VEGF+/+ and
VEGF−/− cells growing in 1% FBS medium were treated without or with 5FU for 48h, then
stained with Annexin V; apoptosis was then assessed by flow cytometry. C. 5FU treatment
led to increased expression of proapoptotic mediators in HCT116 and LS174T VEGF−/−
cells. Whole-cell lysates were collected from cells treated without or with 5FU for 48h and
were analyzed for expression of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, PARP and cleaved PARP by
western blot analysis. Vinculin served as a loading control. D. 5FU treatment led to
increased PARP cleavage in HCT116 VEGF−/− cells in a dose-dependent manner. Wholecell lysates were collected from HCT116 VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells treated without or
with increasing concentrations of 5FU for 48h; the lysates were analyzed for expression of
PARP and cleaved PARP by western blot analysis. The bands for cleaved PARP were
scanned, densitometrically quantitated using NIH Image J software and the resulting data
were plotted (right panel.)

A. VEGF receptor expression and levels in the VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells. The expression
of the VEGF receptors was assessed by RT-PCR (left panel) and western blot analysis (right
panel). HUVEC (Human umbilical vein endothelial cell) cells served as a positive control
for VEGF receptor expression. B. Increased VEGFR1 activation and PlGF expression in
VEGF−/− cells. The phosphorylation of VEGFR1 in the HCT116 VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/−
cells was assessed by western blot analysis (left panel). Total VEGFR1 served as a loading
control. Conditioned medium was collected from HCT116 VEGF+/+ and VEGF−/− cells and
PlGF level was assesses by ELISA (right panel). C. Anti-VEGF antibody treatment did not
affect spontaneous cell death in CRC cells. HCT116 and LS174T cells growing in 1% FBS

stained with PI; cell death was then assessed by flow cytometry. D. Treatment with VEGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor did not affect spontaneous cell death in CRC cells. HCT116 and
LS174T cells growing in 1% FBS medium were treated with DMSO (as solvent control) or
SU5416 (1 μM) for 48h, fixed and stained with PI, cell death was assessed by flow
cytometry.
