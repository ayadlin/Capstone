Abstract
Notch receptors are key regulators of development by
controlling cell-fate determination in many multicellular
organisms. Genes that are important for normal differentiation play a role in cancer when their normal functions became
dysregulated. Notch signaling has been shown to promote and
maintain survival of many types of cancers, and we previously
have shown that Notch3 plays an important role in lung
cancer. In this study, we showed that a high percentage of lung
cancer lines expressed Jagged1, Notch receptors, and their
transcriptional target genes (HES1, Hey1), suggesting that
the Notch pathway plays an important role in lung cancer
biology. Thus, inhibition of Notch receptor activation represents a compelling treatment strategy. Notch activation
requires proteolytic cleavage of the receptor by ;-secretase
protein complex. In this study, we determined the ability of
MRK-003, a ;-secretase inhibitor, to inhibit Notch3 signaling,
growth, and apoptosis of lung cancer cell lines in vitro and
in vivo using mouse xenograft models. We also found that MRK003 inhibited Notch3 signaling, reduced tumor cell proliferation, inhibited serum independence, and induced apoptosis.
This drug had no effect when Notch3 expression was knocked
down using small interfering RNA (siRNA), suggesting that the
observed effects were mediated by specific action on this
receptor. In conclusion, these results support the hypothesis
that inhibition of Notch activation using a ;-secretase inhibitor
represents a potential new approach for the targeted therapy of
lung cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(17):8051–7]

Introduction
Notch receptors are single-pass, transmembrane receptors
whose function is important for normal cell-fate determination
in all known multicellular organisms. In mammals, there are four
Notch receptors, Notch 1 to 4. Notch receptors signal through
binding with their ligands, Jagged 1 and 2 and Delta-like-1, Deltalike-3, and Delta-like-4. Upon ligand binding, the Notch receptor
undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages, resulting in the release
of the intracellular domain, which forms a nuclear complex with
the DNA-binding protein CSL (CBF1, Sel, Lag-1). This interaction
then leads to transcription of the bHLH transcription factors,
Hairy-enhancer of Split (HES) and related genes (Hey; ref. 1).
Although the canonical Notch pathway involves signaling through
HES and related genes, Notch receptors are known to crosstalk

with other pathways involved in oncogenesis, suggesting the
possibility that multiple other pathways are regulated by Notch
receptors, and that these interactions are important in maintaining
the oncogenic state (2–4).
All four members of the Notch family have been implicated in
human cancers (5–10). However, depending on the cellular context,
Notch family members can function as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors (11). We first linked the dysregulation of the Notch3
pathway to human lung cancer through the observation of an
upstream chromosome translocational breakpoint in a tumor from
a nonsmoker (6). Subsequently, we observed overexpression of
Notch3 in about 40% of resected, non–small cell lung cancers
(NSCLC). Through Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE)
profiling data on NSCLC, other investigators show high expression
of Hey1 and HeyL, suggesting that the activation of the Notch
pathway represents an important role of Notch signaling in lung
cancer tumorigenesis (12). Furthermore, we have shown that
inhibiting this pathway in human lung tumors results in the loss of
the malignant phenotype in vitro, in the increased dependency on
exogenous growth factors, and in greater cytotoxicity when
combined with an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (13). Taken together, these observations
suggest that the inhibition of Notch activation either alone or in
combination represents a potential therapeutic strategy in the
clinical setting.
Activation of the canonical Notch pathway involves a series of
proteolytic processing steps following ligand binding. The final
cleavage of Notch receptor by the g-secretase protein complex
releases the Notch intracellular domain whose translocation to the
nucleus is thought to be required for target gene transcription (14).
Any pharmacologic intervention that interferes with the activity of
these proteases can thus theoretically prevent tumor growth in a
Notch-dependent cancer. Presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 are polytopic transmembrane proteins, and they function as part of the
g-secretase protein complex, which include cofactors nicastrin,
APH-1, and PEN-2 (15). This protein complex is also known to be
essential in the normal processing of amyloid h-peptides (Ah).
These peptides are derived from the proteolytic processing of the
h-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through an intermediate
fragment (C99) by g-secretases. Abnormal accumulation of amyloid
h-peptides (Ah) with formation of amyloid plaques is believed to
be the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Indeed, a familial form
of Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) is a result of mutations in presenilin-1
or presenilin-2 (16). Given the connection between Alzheimer’s
disease and g-secretase, there is a great interest in pursuing
compounds that can inhibit this protein complex and thus alleviate
progression in Alzheimer’s disease.
Not surprisingly, because g-secretase protein complex is also
necessary for Notch processing, g-secretase inhibitors developed
as potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease also block Notch

activation and induce apoptosis in multiple cancer cell lines
(17–20). In vivo, these compounds inhibit angiogenesis and tumor
growth (21). Furthermore, some g-secretase inhibitors are currently
in phase I trials for patients with metastatic or locally advanced
breast cancer and for patients with T-cell acute leukemias (22, 23).
Given the data suggesting a role for Notch in lung cancer,
we examined whether targeting of the Notch pathway using a
g-secretase inhibitor, MRK-003, can block Notch signaling in
NSCLC, induce apoptosis, and reduce tumor growth both in vitro
and in tumor xenografts.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and inhibitors. HCC2429 was established as previously
described (6). NSCLC cell lines HCC461, HCC193, HCC95, HCC15, HCC827,
HCC44, and HCC78 were provided by Drs. John D. Minna and Adi Gazdar
(University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). The
remaining lung cancer cell lines were obtained from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC). All lung cancer cell lines were maintained in
RPMI with 10% FCS and analyzed at 80–90% confluency. Tyrosine kinase
inhibitor to EGFR AG1478 was obtained from Calbiochem. The g-secretase
inhibitor MRK-003, its formulation, and in vivo dosing were provided by
Merck & Co., Inc. (20).
Antibodies and Western blot experiments. Notch3 was detected using
a goat polyclonal antibody at 1:1,000 dilution from Orbigen, Inc. Notch2
(C651.6DbHN, developed by Artavanis-Tsakonas) and Notch4 (2423) antibodies from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank at the University of
Iowa and Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. were used at dilutions of 1:200 and
1:500, respectively. Notch1 (C-20) and Jagged1 (H-114) were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at 1:100 and 1:200 dilutions. Antibodies to phospho–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (phospho-ERK),
total ERK, phospho–Bcl-2, Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) were obtained from Cell Signaling and used in accordance with
the manufacturer’s instructions. For Western blot analysis of ERK activation,
the cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 24–48 h before serum
stimulation. The g-secretase inhibitor was also added 24 h before serum
stimulation. Cells were harvested after the designated time points.
Stable transfectants and small interfering RNAs. Notch3-overexpressing cell line HCC2429 were transfected with DNA vector-based small
interfering RNA (siRNA) using Genscript siRNA Expression Vector and
LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen). The target insert is 5¶-CACCUAUAACUGCCAGUGC-3¶. Stable clones were selected using hygromycin. Clones 5,
6, and 8 retained Notch3 expression, whereas clones 12, 15, 17, and 20 lost
Notch3 expression. Transient knockdown of Notch3 was done using siRNA
with above sequences, synthesized by Qiagen.
Apoptosis assays. Transfected cells were plated at a density of 5,000
cells per plate using 35-mm Petri dishes and suspended in 0.4% agar
containing 10% FCS RPMI and 50 Ag/mL of G418 selective antibiotic over a
0.8% base agar. The plates were incubated at 37jC and 5% CO2 humidified
chamber for 14 days. The colonies were counted on the Omnicon Tumor
Colony Analyzer. Changes in proliferation were determined using the
standard 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) proliferation assay. Each experiment was repeated at least thrice
with similar results. Apoptosis was measured following 48 h of serum
starvation, unless otherwise indicated, using the APO-BRDU kit (Pheonix
Flow Systems).
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was
isolated using TRIzol (Invitrogen), and quantitative real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) was carried out using iCycler thermocycler
(Bio-Rad) and the QuantiTect SYBR green RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). PCR was
done at the annealing temperature of 59jC with the following primers for
h-actin: 5¶-TCCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTC-3¶ for sense and 5¶-TTCTGCATCCTGTCGGCAATG-3¶ for antisense. For hASH1, the annealing temperature
of 60jC with the following primers: 5¶-TCCCCCAACTACTCCAACGAC-3¶ for
sense and 5¶-CCCTCCCAACGCCACTG-3¶ for antisense; for HES-1, the
annealing temperature of 57jC with the following primers: 5¶-ACTGATTT-

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (17). September 1, 2007

TGGATGCTCTGAAGA-3¶ for sense and 5¶-GTATTAACGCCCTCGCACGT-3¶
for antisense; and for Hey1, the annealing temperature of 57jC with
the following primers: 5¶-AGCCGAGATCCTGCAGATGA-3¶ for sense and
5¶-GCCGTATGCAGCATTTTCAG-3¶ for antisense. The expression levels of
the transcripts were calculated using the linear exponential phase of
amplification throughout 10 to 35 cycles, and each reaction was normalized
using the h-actin transcript internal control.
In vivo tumorigenicity. Athymic 4- to 6-week-old nude mice (nu+/nu+ )
were used for the xenograft experiments. Lung cancer cell lines HCC2429,
H460, and A549 (1  107 cells) were diluted into 200 AL of PBS and injected
s.c. into the right posterior legs of nude mice. When the tumors were
palpable, the mice were randomly assigned to control or MRK-003–treated
groups. Tumors were measured every 2 days using a caliper. Reported
tumor size was calculated using the following formula (24): Tumor Size =
Length (L)  Width (W).
Statistical analysis. The size of implanted tumors at different time
points following treatment were compared between treated and control
groups. Unless specifically stated, statistical inference in comparative
experiments both in vivo and in vitro was obtained using unpaired, twosided Student’s t test. For all determinations, the differences were
considered significant when P value is V 0.05.

Results
Notch signaling pathway plays a role in lung cancer. We
previously have shown that Notch3 is expressed in about 40% of
resected lung cancer (13). However, little is known about the
prevalence of other Notch receptors or the Notch ligand Jagged1 in
lung cancers. We examined 29 lung cancer cell lines and found that
the majority of tumors (24 of 29) expressed Jagged1, with the
highest expression in A549, HCC2429, HCC95, H2087, H1993,
H1648, and H1435 (Fig. 1A). Twelve tumors (41%) expressed the
activated form of Notch3 (Notch3IC), consistent with our published
data on Notch3 expression in resected tissues (13). Little is known
about the frequency of other Notch receptors’ expression in lung
cancer. In our lung cancer panel, 18 (62%) tumors expressed
activated Notch2. On the other hand, the prevalence of Notch1
(14%) and Notch4 (10%) in lung cancer is much lower, suggesting
that Notch1 and Notch4 do not have significant roles. Notch
receptors signal through transcriptional activation of target genes,

Figure 1. Expression of Notch receptors, ligand, and target genes in lung
cancer cell lines. A, immunoblots show that Jagged1 is expressed in most lung
cancers. In comparison with Notch2 and Notch3 where 18 and 12 of 29 tumors,
respectively, express the activated form, activated Notch1 and Notch4 are less
frequently observed in lung cancers. B, Notch target genes HES-1 and Hey-1
are expressed in a majority of tumors, suggesting that the Notch pathway is often
altered in lung cancer. Potential relationship between Jagged1, Notch receptors,
and target genes were tested using the Fisher’s exact test. However, no
statistically meaningful relationship was observed, suggesting that there is
considerable heterogeneity in the Notch pathway regulation.

HES-1 and Hey1. Consistent with previous reported data using
SAGE technology, HES-1 and/or Hey1 are expressed in a significant
number of lung cancer cell lines (Fig. 1B; ref. 12). Taken together,
prevalent expressions of Jagged1, Notch2, Notch3, HES-1, and Hey1
support the hypothesis that the Notch signaling pathway plays an
important role in lung cancer. Table 1 summarizes the expression
data of selected components of the Notch pathway. We analyzed
the data for the association between Notch receptors, ligand, and
downstream targets using Fisher exact test. No statistically
significant association has been observed, suggesting significant
heterogeneity in Notch pathway regulation.
The Notch inhibitor MRK-003 shows antitumor activities
in vitro and in vivo. To determine whether the g-secretase
inhibitor MRK-003 has antitumor effects in human lung cancers,
we treated lung cancer cell lines HCC2429, H460, and A549 with
increasing doses of MRK-003. The IC50 for this compound varies
between 5 and 10 Amol/L for HCC2429 and f25 Amol/L for H460
and A549 for growth on plastic (Fig. 2A). Although Lewis et al.
(20) observed a time-dependent decrease in cell viability between
days 3 and 8 after incubation of T-cell acute leukemia cell lines
with MRK-003, there was no change in the IC50 observed in lung
cancer cell lines at different time points (data not shown),
suggesting that the effect of Notch signaling is highly context
dependent. In vivo, we observed a statistically significant
reduction of tumor size in treated xenografts with the exception

www.aacrjournals.org

of A549, where minimal reduction in tumor size is observed
(Fig. 2B). Histologic examination of HCC2429 tumors resected
from xenografts shows marked necrosis in the treated tumor
compared with control (Fig. 2C). Reduction of activated Notch3
intracellular domain in resected tumor by immunoblotting
suggests that the dose of 100 mg/kg given daily for 3 days per
week is sufficient to inhibit Notch3 activation and result in tumor
reduction (Fig. 2D).
Notch inhibition with MRK-003 alters expression of the
known Notch effectors and reduces expression of antiapoptotic proteins. Notch receptors are known to signal through
binding with CBF1, resulting in the induction of transcription of
HES (Hairy enhancer of split), and HES-related genes. HES and
related genes are transcriptional repressors. A well-known target of
HES proteins is the human homologue of Achaete-Scute (hASH1).
After treatment with MRK-003, transcription of HES1 and Hey1, a
HES-related gene, were reduced 4- and 2-fold, respectively. As
expected, there is a 4-fold increase in hASH1 transcription (Fig. 3A).
These observations show that MRK-003 inhibits the canonical
Notch signaling pathway. The Notch receptor pathway is known to
be important in apoptotic responses (25, 26). To explore the effect
of this compound on apoptosis in vitro, we examined the Bcl family
protein expression after treatment with the inhibitor. We found
that MRK-003 reduces pBcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression in a dosedependent manner in HCC2429. Furthermore, cleaved PARP is

increased, suggesting the activation of the caspase pathway (Fig.
3B, left). Although expression of cytochrome c further indicates
that MRK-003 induces apoptosis, no effect on Bax or pAkt levels
was seen (Fig. 3B, right).
Notch inhibition makes tumors dependent on exogenous
growth factors. We have previously shown that Notch3 contributes to growth factor independence in lung cancer cells. To
determine whether g-secretase inhibitors can result in a similar
observation, we treated HCC2429 with MRK-003 after 24 h of
serum starvation, followed by induction with 10% FCS. No
expression of pERK was detected at baseline (0 time) before FCS
induction. Induction of pERK can be shown after 15 min of serum
stimulation in all conditions. However, after 30 min, a significant
reduction of pERK was seen in the treated cells compared with
control (Fig. 4A). We further showed that MRK-003 significantly
enhanced apoptosis in the absence of serum as compared with
control. When the cells were maintained in 10% FCS, no change
in apoptosis was observed between treated and untreated cells
(Fig. 4B). The observation that targeting g-secretase reduces serum
independence in cancers suggests that MRK-003 might enhance
antitumor activity of growth factor signaling inhibitors, similar to
our previous observation when lung cancer cells were treated with
a dominant-negative Notch3 receptor (13). To test this hypothesis,
we examined the effect of combining MRK-003 with EGFR tyrosine

kinase inhibitor, AG1478. Using a soft agar colony assay, we
observed a significant decrease in the number of colonies with
the combination therapy compared with either treatment alone
(Fig. 4C and D).
Loss of Notch3 in Notch3-overexpressing tumor cell lines
results in resistant ;-secretase inhibition. To determine
whether the antitumor effect of MRK-003 is dependent on Notch
signaling, we created stable transfectants from cell line HCC2429
transfected with plasmid expressing Notch3 siRNA. Of the total
seven stable cell lines, clones 5, 6, and 8 (siRNA-C) show persistent
Notch3 expression as compared with clones 12, 15, 17, and 20
(siRNA-N3; Fig. 5C). The siRNA-N3 clones retained a high level
of HES-1, suggesting that HES-1 transcriptional activation is
independent of Notch3 activation. Unlike HES1, Hey1 expression
is down-regulated, supporting our previous observation that Hey1
is regulated by Notch3 in comparison with HES1 (13). The siRNA-C
clones retain sensitivity to inhibition of proliferation by MRK-003
as compared with siRNA-N3 clones (Fig. 5A). Resistance to MRK003–induced apoptosis was also noted in the siRNA-N3 clones as
compared with siRNA-C clones (Fig. 5B). To further support the
hypothesis that MRK-003 antitumor activity is dependent on the
retention of Notch3 expression and that the observation were not
due to clonal artifacts, we did a similar experiment with transient
Notch3 knockdown using siRNA. We showed that the transient loss

of Notch3 in HCC2429 also reduces the effectiveness of MRK-003,
particularly after 48 h. These observations further support the
hypothesis that the antitumor activity of MRK-003 is Notch
dependent.

Discussion
Notch signaling plays a fundamental role in normal development
and cell-fate determination in a variety of multicellular organisms.
Genes important in normal differentiation often contribute to
tumor promotion and survival when they became dysregulated.
Although Notch signaling can be growth-promoting or growthinhibitory depending on cellular context, in NSCLC, its function
seems to be oncogenic (12). In our laboratory, we have observed
frequent overexpression of HES-1 and/or Hey1 using RT-PCR,
suggesting that Notch pathway activation is a frequent event in
lung cancer. Given the high mortality of patients with advanced
lung cancer, identification of new targets for intervention is crucial
for improving these outcomes, and Notch signaling represents one
such potential target for intervention.

of the h-amyloid component of plaques in the brains of patients

Figure 3. A, MRK-003 inhibits transcription of Notch target genes, HES-1 and
Hey1 . Human homologue of Achaete-Scute (hASH1) is a target of HES-1–
mediated transcriptional repression. The loss of HES-1 by MRK-003 results in
increased transcription of hASH1. B, MRK-003 induces apoptosis through the
down-regulation of prosurvival proteins. A profile of prosurvival and proapoptotic
proteins shows that MRK-003 induces apoptosis through the down-regulation of
prosurvival proteins pBcl-2 and pBcl-xL and not Bax. Interestingly, pAkt was
not affected by MRK-003.

suffering from Alzheimer’s disease has led to the design of inhibitors
for these proteases. Because g-secretase is required for proteolytic
cleavage of Notch receptors, we hypothesized that these inhibitors
also show activity against Notch signaling in lung cancer cells.
Inhibitors of g-secretase have been shown by some investigators
to reduce angiogenesis and induce apoptosis in other systems,
further supporting the hypothesis that these compounds may have
utility in the treatment of patients with cancer (17–19, 21). Although
Notch signaling has been shown to be important in lung cancer
biology, to date, the effects of these inhibitors on lung cancer is
largely unknown.
In our present study, we showed antitumor activity of the gsecretase inhibitor MRK-003 in both in vitro and in tumorigenicity
models. Treatment with MRK-003 resulted in the down-regulation
of pMAPK, suggesting one mechanism of biological activity.
Induction of PARP and the effects on pBcl-2 and pBcl-xL expression also suggests that the antitumor effect of MRK-003 is also
mediated through the effects on apoptosis. This effect on prosurvival proteins is consistent with the growing body of literature
supporting the role of Notch signaling in apoptosis, the detailed
mechanism of which is largely unknown. However, there are
data suggesting that Notch modulates apoptosis through the
regulation of nuclear factor-nB (26, 27). Thus, the spectrum of
activity we have observed for the g-secretase inhibitor in lung
cancer is consistent with known effects of Notch activation,
suggesting that this is the dominant target for this inhibitor in
lung cancer.
However, g-secretase is known to mediate the proteolysis of
several transmembrane proteins in addition to Notch receptors,
including APP, E-cadherin, CD44, and Erb4 (28–31). Although the
loss of activated Notch3 with the concomitant reduction
transcriptional expression, Hey1 and HES-1 confirms that MRK003 targets Notch3 processing; this observation alone does not
prove that all of the antitumor effect is Notch3 dependent.
However, our studies demonstrating resistance to MRK-003 in
Notch3-null clones do support the hypothesis that the dominant
antitumor effects observed from MRK-003 are through effects on
Notch3 proteolysis in the Notch3-overexpressing cell line
HCC2429. Although Notch1 is also expressed in HCC2429,
complete abrogation of the MRK-003 effect on apoptosis by
Notch3 siRNA suggests that Notch1 do not contribute significantly to the survival of these tumor cells. Further studies are
needed to clarify the respective roles of each receptor in lung
cancer.
Another approach toward examining the specificity of gsecretase inhibitors is to determine whether transfection of tumor
cells with activated, intracellular domain of Notch3 (N3ICD) can
rescue the effect of these inhibitors on proliferation and
apoptosis as has been shown in Kaposi’s sarcoma for Notch1,
2, and 4 (18). However, the potential nonphysiologic effects of
overexpression of an activated transcriptional domain such as the
Notch intracellular domain can potentially lead to the potentiation of growth of other physiologic pathways despite drug
inhibition. Finally, CD44, E-cadherin, and ErbB-4 have all been
identified as potential g-secretase targets and thus could
contribute to the effects we have observed, especially the synergy
with EGF TKIs.
In summary, our study shows the antitumor activity of a gsecretase inhibitor MRK-003 in lung cancer cells. Our data showed
that MRK-003 induces apoptosis and reduces tumor growth in vivo.

suggesting that HES1 is independent of
Notch3. In comparison, siRNA-N3 clones
12, 15, 17, and 20, where Notch3
expression is lost, are no longer sensitive
to MRK-003. B, a similar observation is
made in measuring the sensitivity of these
cells to MRK-003–induced apoptosis.
Induction of apoptosis is also inhibited
when Notch3 was transiently knocked
down with siRNA in both supplement and
serum-free conditions after 48 h (D).

g-Secretase Inhibitor Prevents Notch3 Activation

supports our hypothesis that the dominant mechanism of activity is
via inhibition of Notch3 activation. Finally, induction of dependency
on exogenous growth factors by this compound suggested that
combining MRK-003 with other biological compounds can enhance
antitumor activity and represents a novel strategy for the targeted
therapy of lung cancer.
