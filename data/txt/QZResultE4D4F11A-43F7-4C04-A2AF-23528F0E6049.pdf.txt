ABSTRACT:
The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR cascades are often activated
by genetic alterations in upstream signaling molecules such as receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK). Certain components of these pathways, RAS, NF1, BRAF, MEK1, DUSP5,
PP2A, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, PIK3R5, IRS4, AKT, NFKB1, MTOR, PTEN, TSC1,
and TSC2 may also be activated/inactivated by mutations or epigenetic silencing.
Upstream mutations in one signaling pathway or even in downstream components
of the same pathway can alter the sensitivity of the cells to certain small molecule
inhibitors. These pathways have profound effects on proliferative, apoptotic and
differentiation pathways. Dysregulation of components of these cascades can
contribute to: resistance to other pathway inhibitors, chemotherapeutic drug
resistance, premature aging as well as other diseases. This review will first describe
these pathways and discuss how genetic mutations and epigenetic alterations can
result in resistance to various inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and
the types and classes of mutations which occur in these
pathways. Since the discovery of the RAS, RAF, MEK,
PIK3CA, and AKT oncogenes and NF1, DUSP5, PP2A,
PTEN, TSC1 and TSC2 tumor suppressor genes, the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
signaling cascades have been extensively investigated
with the ultimate goal of determining how these genes

This review is an updated and expanded version of
a previous review on this topic [1]. This current review
now discusses some of the types and classes of mutations
which occurs in these pathways and their biochemical
importance in terms of therapy. We will focus on the
recent advancements in elucidating the roles of the Ras/

become activated/inactivated and whether it is possible
to suppress their activity in cancer and other growthrelated diseases [1-6]. Furthermore these pathways are
also frequently implicated in the resistance and sometimes
sensitivity to therapy [1-6]. Research has also resulted
in the development of inhibitors that target critical
components of these pathways with the ultimate goal to
increase patient survival or in some cases to prevent or
impede the development of other diseases (e.g., obesity,
diabetes and premature aging) [7-9].
Before we discuss the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling cascades, it is
important to define some genetic terms as they are critical
to understanding the importance of these pathways and the
classes of genes and mutations that occur in components
of these cascades. We briefly discuss certain classes of
genes which play key roles in the development of cancer.
Caretaker genes are involved in genomic stability and
normally function to suppress the mutation rate [10].
Caretaker mutations occur mainly in tumor suppressor
genes, such as TP53 (p53) and PTEN. TP53 and PTEN
are caretaker genes. Caretaker genes help maintain the
integrity of the genome.
Gatekeeper genes directly regulate cell growth and
their loss can lead to tumorigenesis. They encode critical
proteins which can regulate growth or the induction of
apoptosis. Many genes fall into this class including:
MAPK3/MAPK1 (ERK1/ERK2), TP53, PTEN, NF1, TSC1
TSC2, MTOR (mTOR), EIF4E (eIF4E). Obviously some
genes can fall into multiple classifications [11].	
The concept of a driver mutation is very important
in cancer. If the driver mutation can be successfully
targeted that may lead to elimination of the cancer. This
is a mutation that is statistically enriched in a particular
cancer and usually thought to be one of the first events in
the malignant transformation of those particular cells to
cancer cells [12]. Examples of driver mutations in these
two pathways include RAS, NF1, BRAF, MEK1, PIK3CA
(PI3K), and PTEN.
A second class of mutations is passenger mutations
[6]. Passenger mutations may occur by different
mechanisms. Passenger mutations may occur upon
genomic deletion of the region of the chromosome which
contains the driver mutation [6]. This has been observed
in glioblastoma which have the glycolytic gene enolase 1
(ENO1) gene deleted as it is in the neighborhood of the
1p36 tumour-suppressor locus [6]. ENO1 is a member of a
gene family and there are two other ENO genes. Normally,
the cell can survive in the presence of ENO1 deletion,
however, if ENO2 is silenced, the cancer cell with the
ENO1 deletion dies. This provides a selective approach to
kill cancer cells, illustrating the significance of identifying
passenger mutations.
Next we discuss types of mutations which can
result in therapeutic resistance. Gatekeeper mutations
often occur in genes (often protein kinases) in either
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the inhibitor binding site or in the ATP binding site of
the protein. They are detected in BRAF, ERK, BCRABL,
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and can
mediate resistance to small molecule inhibitors as that is
often where they bind and inhibit activity. They have also
been detected in PIK3CA but not necessarily in the hot
spot locations [13,14]. Hot spot locations are regions of
the gene where mutations are most frequently detected and
they can confer a biochemical advantage to the cells which
allows abnormal growth.
A synthetic lethal mutation refers to a mutation that
occurs in a second gene and results in the death of the
cell. This terminology was coined by yeast geneticists.
Synthetic lethal screening has resulted in the elucidation
of how certain gene products interact with other gene
products forming biochemical pathways [15,16].
For example, when there is an activated oncogene or
inactivated tumor suppressor gene present in a cell which
frequently leads to the abnormal proliferation of the cells,
a synthetic lethal mutation may occur at a second gene
which results in the death of the transformed cell [17-19].
In essence, there is the loss of a biochemical interaction
between the mutant oncogene or tumor suppressor gene
and the second gene and the cell dies. Hence the second
mutation is referred to as synthetic lethal. In terms of
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, which proliferates
in response to mutant KRAS, silencing of genes such
as voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC1), serine/
threonine kinase 33 (STK33), TANK- binding kinase 1
(TBK) or polo-like kinase-1 (PLK1) results in synthetic
lethal interactions [15]. Synthetic lethal interactions are
frequently identified by screening siRNA or shRNA
libraries. In the PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway, a
synthetic lethal interaction is observed in renal cell
carcinoma (RCC) cells which lack the von Hippel–Lindau
tumor suppressor protein (VHL) as treatment of the cells
with rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTORC1 which the tumor
cells are dependent on, results in death [15,16].
Lineage-specific mutations occur in genes which
are abnormally expressed in certain types of cancers.
In certain cell types, the cells become addicted to a
lineage-specific gene as well as the mutant oncogene(s).
An example is observed in melanoma cells which have
mutant BRAF. These cells often have increased expression
of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor
(MITF) which is believed to allow the survival of cells
of the melanocyte lineage. MITF is sometimes amplified
in certain subsets of melanoma cells and cooperates
with mutant BRAF to regulate melanoma proliferation.
In normal melanocytes, MITF induces cell cycle arrest,
whereas in melanoma cells, mutant B-Raf may stimulate
MITF transcription while this stimulation of transcription
does not occur in normal melanocytes [20].
Oncogene-addiction is a widely-used term to
describe the transformed cells addiction to a particular
gene or pathway [20-27]. The transformed cells

Figure 1: Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways by Genetic Mutations.
Activation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways can occur by upstream mutations in growth factor
receptors or by mutations in upstream kinases and coupling molecules. In addition, intrinsic members of the two pathways are frequently
mutated in human cancer. Genes in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways that have activating mutations
detected in human cancer and proliferative diseases are indicated in red ovals. Four mutations have been detected in the RHEB gene in 903
samples present in the Sanger Institute COSMIC database. Four mutations have been observed in the p70S6K gene (RBS6KB1) out of 1047
samples examined (Sanger Institute COSMIC database. Also loss of tumor suppressor genes such as PTEN, PP2A, NF1 DUSP5, TSC1,
TSC2 can contribute to activation of certain pathways. These are indicated in black octagons if they are phosphatases or black squares if
they are coupling molecules. Other kinases not frequently mutated in human cancer are indicated in green symbols. PIP2 and PIP3 are
indicated in yellow ovals. The 4E-BP1and eIF-4E proteins are indicated in purple ovals. mTORC1 phosphorylates the unc-51-like kinase 1
(ULK1) which results in the suppression of autophagy. ULK1 is indicated in a black oval. The mTORC1 inhibitor prevents phosphorylation
of ULK1 and autophagy can occur. Red arrows indicate activating events in pathways. Black arrows indicate inactivating events in pathway.

frequently contain a mutation at a particular oncogene,
or correspondingly, inactivation of a tumor suppressor
gene. The cells become addicted to the consequences of
that mutation and grow under conditions where a normal
cell would not persist [22]. Many malignant melanoma
cells become addicted to mutant BRAF for proliferation
[20]. Likewise either mutation of PIK3CA or silencing of
PTEN and subsequent activation of Akt is a frequent form
of oncogene addiction in many tumor types [1,2,20-27].
Oncogene bypass occurs when a cell bypasses the
signal transduction component it normally depended
upon for survival [4]. This has been observed in certain
cells which were normally dependent upon EGFR for
survival, however, when upon exposure to an EGFR
inhibitor, cells emerged which displayed amplification
of another oncogene, the MET oncogene (MNNG-HOS
transforming gene) which allowed the growth of the cells
in the presence of the EGFR inhibitor [22].
Kinase switching is a similar event. An example is
when cells with the BRAF V600E mutation were cultured
in the presence of the B-Raf inhibitor SB-590885,
inhibitor-resistant cells arose which utilized the related
Raf-1 and A-Raf isoforms [28]. The genetic mechanisms
for oncogene bypass and kinase switching as well as many
of the changes in inhibitor-resistant cells are complicated
and may result from the outgrowth of a minority of the
cells present in the original tumor or cell line.
Oncogenic shock is a term that is used to describe
the biochemical consequences of inhibiting the oncogene.
Interestingly, it has been observed that upon inactivation
of the oncogene responsible for survival, the pro-survival
and pro-apoptotic signals decay at different rates. In
absence of the oncogene responsible for the oncogene
addiction phenotype, the pro-survival signals decay more
rapidly than the pro-apoptotic signals. This has led to the
concept of oncogenic shock and provides the basics for the
success of certain inhibitors in suppressing the growth of
oncogene-transformed cells [25]. Oncogenic shock may be
connected with the translation of “weak mRNAs” which
are regulated by the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) (see
below). Both the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathways interact to regulate the activity of
the mTORC1 complex. The half-lifes of proteins such as
Akt and ERK are very short (within minutes), while the
half-lifes of pro-apoptotic signals are much longer (hours).
The decreased activity of Akt and ERK proteins will have
a direct effect on the translation of weak mRNAs which
often encode growth factors and other important proteins
regulating cell growth (e.g., c-Myc). This is one reason
why targeting the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathways has such profound effects on cell
growth.
Non-oncogene addiction is a more recently devised
term to describe the addiction of a cell on another gene
which is not an oncogene per se [26]. For example,
rapamycin and modified rapamycins (rapalogs) target
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mTORC1 which is not normally considered an oncogene,
but the cells are dependent upon the mTORC1 complex
for their survival. RCC which lack the pVHL tumor
suppressor protein exhibit non-oncogene addiction [27].
Now that we have discussed some general genetic terms,
we can discuss in more detail the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways.

The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Pathway
Usually signaling commences upon ligation of a
growth factor/cytokine/interleukin/mitogen (ligand) to
its cognate receptor at the cell surface. This event can
result in the activation of many downstream signaling
cascades including the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways. These cascades can
further transmit their signals to the nucleus to control gene
expression, to the translational apparatus to enhance the
translation of “weak” mRNAs, to the apoptotic machinery
to regulate apoptosis or to other events involved in
the regulation of cellular proliferation (for example,
interactions with the p53 pathway to regulate cell cycle
progression). Regulation of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways is mediated by
a series of kinases, phosphatases, GTP:GDP exchange
and scaffolding proteins. There are also many tumor
suppressor proteins which interact with these cascades
which frequently serve to fine tune or limit activity (e.g.,
PTEN, RKIP, PP2A, DUSP5, DUSP6, TSC1, TSC2).
Mutations occur in many of the genes in these pathways
leading to uncontrolled regulation and aberrant signaling
[5,28-32]. Certain of these tumor suppressor genes can
be regulated by oncogenic micro (mi) RNAs [33]. An
overview of the effects of mutations and the activation of
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathways and how they interact is presented in
Figure 1. In this review, we will point out which genes
are abnormally expressed in human cancer to illustrate the
importance of these genes and pathways.
Following stimulation of a growth factor receptor
(GFR), a Src homology 2 domain containing protein (Shc)
adaptor protein becomes associated with the C-terminus
of the activated GFR, e.g., EGFR, insulin like growth
factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR) and many others [1-3, 34-38].
EGFR mutations can contribute to transformation of
multiple cell lineages and these alterations are considered
driver mutations
Shc recruits the growth factor receptor-bound
protein 2 (Grb2) protein and the son of sevenless (SOS)
homolog protein [a guanine nucleotide exchange factor
(GEF)], resulting in the loading of the membrane-bound
GDP:GTP exchange protein (GTPase) Ras with GTP [1,2].
RAS is frequently mutated in many diverse human cancers.
RAS mutations are often driver mutations. GEFs promote
Ras activation by displacing GDP from Ras which leads

Figure 2: Regulatory Loops in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK Pathway. ERK can phosphorylate members of the Ras/Raf/MEK/

ERK pathway and even upstream EGFR. Sometimes these phosphorylation events mediated by ERK can inhibit the activity of the
phosphorylated molecule. ERK can also phosphorylate Ets which can lead to transcription of the DUSP genes which in turn can inactivate
ERK by dephosphorylation. PP2A can also suppress Raf activity by dephosphorylation. The activated EGFR is depicted in blue. Kinases
are indicated by green ovals. Phosphatases are indicated by black octagons. Coupling molecules are indicated by orange ovals. Ras is

to GTP binding.
Ras activation is suppressed by the GTPase
activating proteins (GAPs) that stimulate the GTPase
activity of Ras. There are two prominent GAP proteins,
p120GAP and NF1. NF1 is a tumor suppressor gene and
has both driver and gatekeeper gene functions. Germline
mutations at NF1 lead to neurofibromatosis [29].
Ras can also be activated by GFRs, such as insulin
receptor (IR), via intermediates like insulin receptor
substrate (IRS) proteins that bind Grb2 [34]. IRS4 has
recently been documented to be mutated in melanoma [5].
Ras:GTP then recruits the serine/threonine (S/T) kinase
Raf to the membrane where it becomes activated, likely
via a Src-family tyrosine (Y) kinase [1,2]. Recently Rasmediated Raf-1 activation has been shown to be dependent
on calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II
(CaMK-II) which phosphorylates Raf-1 at S338 in some
experimental stimulation conditions [EGF, fetal bovine
serum (FBS) treatment]. This dependency does not appear
to occur with regards to B-Raf activation [39].
Both RAS and RAF are members of multi-gene
families and there are three Ras members (KRAS, NRAS
and HRAS) [1-4] and three RAF members [BRAF, RAF1
(a.k.a c-Raf) and ARAF) [1-3]. BRAF is frequently
mutated in melanomas and certain other cancers and these
mutations are frequently driver mutations [40].
Raf-1 can be regulated by dephosphorylation by
the protein serine/threonine phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and
others [41,42]. PP2A has been reported to positively and
negatively regulate Raf-1. PP2A is also considered a
tumor suppressor gene and has gatekeeper gene functions
[43].
Raf phosphorylates and activates the mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1) (a dual
specificity kinase (T/Y) on S/T residues [1-4]). Other
proteins such as kinase suppressor of Ras (KSR) have
recently been shown to phosphorylate MEK1 [44-48].
KSR has scaffolding properties and interacts with Raf,
MEK and ERK which regulate ERK activation [44-48].
KSR can form dimers with various Raf proteins which
alter the effects of Raf inhibitors. KSR1 competes with
Raf-1 for Raf inhibitor-induced binding to B-Raf which
decreases the normal ERK activation observed after Rafinhibitor treatment [47].
MEK1 phosphorylates extracellular signal regulated
kinases 1/2 (ERK1 and 2) at specific T /Y residues [1-4].
MEK1 was originally not thought to be mutated frequently
in human cancer. However, recent large scale mutation
screening studies and studies aimed at determining
mechanisms of resistance to small molecule inhibitors
have observed that MEK1 is mutated in certain human
cancers and also is mutated in certain inhibitor-resistant
cells. MEK1 is also considered to be a driver oncogene
in certain cancers [49]. Rac (Ras related gene) and p21activating kinases (PAK) can also regulate MEK/ERK
activation [50,51].
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Activated ERK1 and ERK2 S/T kinases
phosphorylate and activate a variety of substrates,
including p90 Ribosomal six kinase-1 (p90Rsk1) and this
pathway has been implicated in cancer progression [1-3].
ERK1/2 are considered by some as gatekeeper genes. ERK
also phosphorylates MAPK signal integrating kinases
(Mnk1/2) which can in turn phosphorylate (eukarytotic
translation initiation factor 4E) eIF4E, a key protein
involved in the translation of difficult mRNAs [1-3].
EIF4E is considered to be a gatekeeper gene.
p90Rsk1 can activate the cAMP response element
binding protein (CREB) transcription factor as well as
proteins involved in regulation of protein translation (e.g.,
Mnk-1, p70 ribosomal S6 kinase (p70S6K), eukaryotic
translation initiation factor 4B, (eIF4B), and ribosomal
protein S6 (rpS6) [52].
The number of ERK1/2 substrates/targets is
easily in the hundreds. These substrate/targets include
different types of molecules including: other kinases,
phosphatases, growth factor receptors, cytokines, cell
cycle regulator proteins, transcription factors, or proteins
involved in mRNA translation or apoptosis. Suppression
of MEK and ERK can have profound effects on cell
growth, inflammation and aging. Activated ERK can also
phosphorylate “upstream” Raf-1 and MEK1 which alter
their activity. Depending upon the site phosphorylated on
Raf-1, ERK phosphorylation can either enhance [53] or
inhibit [54] Raf-1 activity. In contrast, some studies have
indicated that when MEK1 is phosphorylated by ERK,
its activity decreases [55]. Recent studies indicate that
ERK does not negatively feedback inhibit B-Raf [56].
ERK also phosphorylates SOS at multiples sites leading
to the dissociation of SOS from GRB2 and preventing
Ras activation [4, 57]. ERK can also phosphorylate
EGFR and suppress its activity [58]. The dual specificity
phosphatases (DUSP) (aka MKPs) are transcriptionally
induced by ERK phosphorylation of transcription factors
(e.g., Ets) [59]. The DUSPs serve as negative feedback
regulators to suppress ERK activity. Some of the events
induced by ERK phosphorylation are rapid, such as posttrasnlational modification, while other events require gene
transcription and translation (e.g., ERK phosphorylation
of Ets which induces transcription of DUSPs). The
DUSPs are potentially tumor suppressor genes and DUSP
mutations have been detected in various cancers [60]. An
overview of the regulatory loops in the Ras/Raf/MEK/
ERK pathway is presented in Figure 2.
The Raf/MEK/ERK pathway exhibits properties
of a negative feedback amplifier (NFA). In essence, NFA
signaling is similar in biological design to those used in
electronic circuits. NFAs in electronic circuits optimize
robustness, stabilization of signal and linearization of non
linear signal amplification. These properties of the Raf/
MEK/ERK NFA are important in determining activation
kinetics, response to drugs and various other downstream
effects of activated ERK [56].
959

Phosphorylation events induced by ERK serve
to alter the stability and/or activities of the proteins.
These examples of feed-back loops become important in
consideration of whether to just target MEK or to target
both Raf and MEK in various cancers. It is important that
the reader realize that certain phosphorylation events can
either inhibit or repress the activity of the affected protein.
This often depends on the particular residue on the protein
phosphorylated which can confer a different configuration
to the protein or target the protein to a different subcellular

localization that may result in proteasomal degradation or
association with certain scaffolding proteins.
There are numerous scaffolding/chaperonin proteins
which interact with various components of the Raf/MEK/
ERK cascade (e.g., 14-3-3) [61], MEK partner-1 (MP1) [62], heat shock protein-90 (HSP-90) [63], KSR [64]
Raf kinase inhibitory protein (RKIP) [65]. Heat shock
proteins such as HSP-90 are considered caretakers as they
normally serve to protect the activity of client proteins
[66, 67]. Mutations at KRAS will confer sensitivity to

HSP-90 inhibitors such as geldanamycin, documenting
the importance of HSP-90 in regulation of this pathway
[68,69].
RKIP is also considered a metastasis suppressor
gene in certain cancers and has gatekeeper and caretaker
effects. Raf-1 activation by Ras has been shown to be
dependent on the prohibitin protein, a ubiquitously
expressed protein which may also serve as a chaperonin
protein [70].
The regulation of ERK1/2 activity in the nucleus
and cytoplasm is complex as the p38MAPK-alpha splice
isoform Max-interacting protein (Mxi-2) can bind ERK1/2
and ensure its translocation into the nucleus and prevent
both MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP1) and DUSP5 from
dephosphorylating ERK1/2 in the nucleus and not the
cytoplasm. Most phosphatases will probably eventually be
shown to be tumor suppressor genes. Upon Mxi-2 binding
ERK1/2, enhanced ERK1/2 activity is detected in the
nucleus. Mxi-2 prevents the dephosphorylation of ERK1/2
by MKP1 and DUSP5. This allows activated ERK1/2 to
phosphorylate the transcription factor c-Myc and other
critical substrates [71-73].
In the nucleus ERK can phosphorylate transcription
factors, such as: E twenty-six-like transcription factor 1
(Elk-1), estrogen receptor (ER), Fos, globin transcription
factor 1 (Gata-1), c-Myc, signal transducer activation of
transcription 1 & 3 (STAT1 & 3) and others [1-3,55,7476]. These transcription factors bind the promoters of
many genes, including growth factor and cytokine genes
that are important in promoting growth and preventing
apoptosis of multiple cell types.
ERK can also phosphorylate and modulate the
activity of the Twist, Snail, Slug, and Zeb1 transcription
factors either directly or indirectly which can regulate
cellular proliferation, survival and some can modulate
epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) [77-92].
Phosphorylation of the transcription factors by ERK1/2,
or in some cases the related MAPK, p38MAPK, prevents
their ubiquitination and results in their stabilization and
increased activity in the nucleus and ability to promote
EMT [83-92].
In the nucleus, ERK can also phosphorylate mitogen
and stress-activated protein kinases (MSKs) [93,94] which
in turn can phosphorylate transcription factors such as
activator transcription factor-1 (ATF-1) that is important in
the regulation of many immediate early genes controlled
by activating protein-1 (AP-1) [95]. The ternary complex
factors (TCF) such as Elk-1, Sap-1 and Net are also
phosphorylated by ERK which results in their activation
[96,97]. The TCFs form complexes with serum responsive
factor (SRF) and activate many genes through their serum
responsive elements (SRE) in their promoter regions
[98,99].
MSKs also phosphorylate many proteins involved
in modulating chromatin structure including: Histone
H3, and (high-mobility-group protein-14) HMG14 which
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

can result in the transcription of immediate early genes
after mitogens/growth factor stimulation [100]. ERK1/2
can phosphorylate many proteins critical for cytoskeletal
structure/reorganization including:
calpain (Capn)
[101], focal adhesion kinase (FAK) [102], myosin light
polypeptide kinase (MLCK) and paxillin-6 (Pax6) [103].
Sometimes phosphorylation by ERK of FAK can result in
FAK dephosphorylation [104].
Thus the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is important
in determining cellular shape and mobility/invasion. Under
certain circumstances, aberrant regulation of this pathway
can contribute to abnormal cellular growth, mobility and
invasion which may lead to many abnormalities including;
autocrine transformation, drug resistance, senescence,
premature aging, or metastasis [1,2,105-119].
Thus the reader begins to understand how the Ras/
Raf/MEK/ERK pathways can regulate the expression of
many genes involved in the response to growth factors
and mitogens. Furthermore many of the genes in this
pathway, as well as other genes that regulate the activity
of this pathway, have varying abilities to influence cancer
development. They can sometimes be drivers of cancer
development, gatekeeper or caretaker genes. An overview
of the effects of the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR pathways on key regulatory pathways is
presented in Figure 3.

Mutations or Altered Expression of the Ras/Raf/
MEK/ERK Pathway Components
In our previous reviews [1,3] we have discussed
in detail the frequency of Ras mutations observed in
human cancers. Ras mutations have been observed in
approximately 20 to 30% of human cancers. Often point
mutations are detected in RAS genes in cancer cells
from patients which enhance Ras activity. Genome RAS
amplification or overexpression of Ras, perhaps due
to altered methylation of its promoter region, are also
detected in some tumors [1]. The frequency of KRAS
mutations is very high (~80%) in advanced pancreatic
cancers [1]. Mutations in Ki-Ras will make cells sensitive
to HSP90 inhibitors [68,69]. BRAF is mutated frequently
in melanomas (50-70%) [5,120], papillary thyroid cancers
(40%) [121], Langerhans’-cell histiocytosis (57%) [122].
BRAF is mutated to lesser extent (2-3%) in non small cell
lung cancers (NSCLC), [123] and colo-rectal cancers
(CRC) (8%) [124]. Recently BRAF has been observed
to be frequently mutated (100%) in hairy cell leukemia.
[125]. BRAF has been observed to be mutated in 8 of
199 patients (4%) with multiple myeloma and 4 of those
were mutant at BRAF V600E [126]. Other B-ALL and
peripheral B cell lymphomas have been observed to have
low (>3%) frequencies of BRAF mutations, but none of
these mutants produced the B-Raf V600E protein [127130]. Similar mutations were not detected in the Tiacci et

al. study with similar leukemias and lymphomas [125]. A
recent study detected BRAF mutations in 2/55 (3.6%) of
large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The authors postulated
that BRAF may be considered driver mutations for those
DLBCL [131]. Cancer patients with the BRAF driver
mutations are postulated to be sensitive to B-Raf inhibitors
such as vemurafenib, dabrafenib, and GDC-0879.
	 Previously it was thought that the MEK and ERK
genes were not frequently mutated in human cancer. More
recent analysis has indicated that MEK1 and MEK2 are
mutated in certain cancers (e.g., ovarian and lung cancers)
and can be driver mutations [49, 131-134]. Mutations at
MEK1 are also important in governing the sensitivity/
resistance of certain cells to Raf and MEK inhibitors and
will be discussed in an accompanying review [134].
Upstream components of this pathway are also
mutated or deregulated in human cancer [1-4]. Some
common receptors which are altered in human cancer
include EGFR, HER2, IGF-1R, PDGFR, VEGF, and
FGFR2/3 [1-4].

[2,14,135-138]. PI3K serves to phosphorylate a series of
membrane phospholipids including: phosphatidylinositol
4-phosphate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate,
catalyzing the transfer of ATP-derived phosphate to
the D-3 position of the inositol ring of membrane
phosphoinositides, thereby forming the second messenger
lipids phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PIP2)
and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3)
[2,14,135-138]. Most often, PI3K is activated via the
binding of a ligand to its cognate receptor, whereby
p85 associates with phosphorylated Y residues on the
receptor via a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain. After
association with the receptor, the p110 catalytic subunit
then transfers phosphate groups to the aforementioned
membrane phospholipids [2,14,135-138]. It is these
lipids, specifically PIP3, that attract a series of kinases
to the plasma membrane thereby initiating the signaling
cascade [2,14,135-138,142]. The p85 PI3K subunit also
plays key roles in regulating flux through this pathway by
controlling both PI3K p110 and PTEN [143].
Downstream of PI3K is the primary effector
molecule of the PI3K signaling cascade, Akt/ protein
kinase B (PKB) which is a 57 kDa S/T kinase that
phosphorylates many targets on RxRxxS/T (R = Arginine)
consensus motifs [1-3, 135-138, 142-148]. Driver AKT
mutations are detected in some human cancer [10,49].
Akt was discovered originally as the cellular
homologue of the transforming retrovirus AKT8. It is a
kinase with properties similar to protein kinases A and
C [2,144]. Akt contains an amino-terminal pleckstrin
homology (PH) domain that serves to target the protein
to the membrane for activation [1-3,135-138,142-148].
Within its central region, Akt has a large kinase domain
and is flanked on the carboxy-terminus by hydrophobic
and proline-rich regions. Akt-1 is activated via
phosphorylation of two residues: T308 and S473, Akt-2
and Akt-3 are highly related molecules and have similar
modes of activation. Akt-1 and Akt-2 are ubiquitously
expressed while Akt-3 exhibits a more restricted tissue
distribution. Akt-3 is found abundantly in nervous tissue
[144-148].
The phosphotidylinositide-dependent kinases
(PDKs) are responsible for activation of Akt. PDK1 is
the kinase responsible for phosphorylation of Akt-1 at
T308 [144]. Akt-1 is also phosphorylated at S473 by
the mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) complex
referred to as (Rapamycin-insensitive companion
of mTOR/mLST8 complex) mTORC2 [135-138].
Before the discovery of the ability of mTORC2 to
phosphorylate S473, the activity responsible for this
phosphorylation event was referred to as PDK2. Akt2 and Akt-3 are phosphorylated in similar fashions.
Therefore, phosphorylation of Akt is complicated as it
is phosphorylated by a complex that lies downstream
of activated Akt itself [1,2,135-138]. Thus, as with the
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, there are feedback loops

The Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathway
Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K)
is
a
heterodimeric protein with an 85-kDa regulatory subunit
and a 110-kDa catalytic subunit (PIK3CA) [1-3, 135138]. PIK3CA is frequently mutated in certain cancers
such as: breast, ovarian, colorectal, endometrial and lung
[1,14,139] although its role as a driver mutation in these
cancers remains controversial [140]. Recent studies have
shown in the lung cancers with mutant PIK3CA, there are
also mutations at other driver oncogenes, such as EGFR,
KRAS, BRAF, MEK, and anaplastic lymphoma kinase
(ALK) [141]. Recent studies in melanoma have indicated
that some components of the PI3K pathway (PTEN,
MTOR, IRS4, PIK3R1, PIK3R4, PIK3R5 and NFKB1)
are co-mutated in 17% of BRAF V600E mutant and 9%
of NRAS mutant melanomas [5]. An overview of the Ras/
PI3K/PTEN/Akt mTOR pathway and the regulator circuits
is presented in Figure 4.
There are three classes of PI3K, each with distinct
substrate specificity and lipid products: I, II, and III [135138]. In mammals, class I PI3Ks are the best understood
PI3Ks and are expressed in all cell types. To date, class I
PI3Ks are the most widely implicated in human cancers
[2,14,135-138] and for this reason they will be the only
PI3Ks discussed in detail in this review. Class I PI3Ks
are divided further into A and B subtype. Class IA PI3Ks
are dimers comprising a regulatory (p85-alpha, p85-beta,
p55-alpha, p55-gamma, p50-alpha) and a catalytic (p110alpha, p110-beta, p110-delta) subunit. Class IA PI3Ks act
downstream of both tyrosine kinase receptors (TKRs) and
G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The single class
IB PI3K comprise a p110-gamma catalytic subunit which
binds one of two related regulatory subunits, p101 and
p87. Class IB PI3Ks are activated downstream of GPCRs

that serve to regulate the activity of the Ras/PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway. These events also serve to
illustrate that these signal transduction pathways are not
really linear, but highly interactive. Once activated, Akt
leaves the cell membrane to phosphorylate intracellular
substrates. Akt activity is regulated by many mechanisms
including the levels of PIP3 which are controlled
positively and negatively by PI3K of PTEN respectively,
by phosphorylation by PDK1 and mTORC2 as well as
ubiquitination [149].
After activation, Akt is able to translocate to the
nucleus [1-3, 134-138] where it affects the activity of a
number of transcriptional regulators. Some examples
of molecules which regulate gene transcription that are
phosphorylated by Akt include: CREB [149], E2F [150],
nuclear factor kappa from B cells (NF-kappaB) via
inhibitor kappa B protein kinase (I-kappaK) [151], the
forkhead (FOXO) transcription factors [152], and murine
double minute 2 (MDM2) which regulates p53 activity [13,134-138]. These are all either direct or indirect substrates
of Akt and each can regulate cellular proliferation, survival
and some can modulate EMT (e.g., NF-kappaB) [135,151154]. Besides transcription factors, Akt targets a number
of other molecules to affect the survival state of the cell
including: the pro-apoptotic molecules Bcl-2-associated
death promoter (BAD) and Bcl-2 interacting mediator
of cell death (Bim) [153], as well as, glycogen-synthase
kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta) (see Figure 3) [164]. GSK-3beta
regulates beta-catenin protein stability, which is important
in regulation of EMT. When Akt phosphorylates GSK3beta, it is targeted to the proteasome and beta-catenin is
active and able to stimulate gene expression. Hence the
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway is connected to the Wnt/
beta-catenin, p53 and many additional pathways including
Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK.
Akt has many diverse effects on proliferation,
survival, senescence, invasion, metastasis, drug resistance
and DNA damage repair and autophagy [155-162]. Akt
is involved in cell cycle progression and migration [163].
Akt may also affect the ability of miRNAs to target their
respective genes. Akt is a known inhibitor of autophagy
and inhibition of Akt by certain tumor suppressors will
induce autophagy [164]. A recent study suggests that Akt
may regulate the processing of certain miRNAs by posttranscriptional mechanisms regulate miRNAs’ processing
or their stability which induces rapid fluctuation in their
levels [165]. Akt and its downstream targets (e.g., the Foxo
transcription factor) are involved in aging and suppression
of Akt activity, which results in increased Foxo activity, by
food supplements such as curcumin, prevents aging [166].
Negative regulation of the PI3K pathway is
primarily accomplished through the action of the PTEN
tumor suppressor protein. PTEN encodes a lipid and
protein phosphatase whose primary lipid substrate is PIP3
[1-3,136-138,167-170]. The purported protein substrate(s)
of PTEN are more varied, including focal adhesion kinase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(FAK), the Shc exchange protein and the transcriptional
regulators ETS-2 and Sp1 and the platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) [167-171]. Both the lipid and
protein phosphatase activities of PTEN are important for
prevention of invasion [171].
PTEN has four primary structural domains. In
the amino terminus is the lipid and protein phosphatase
domain. This is adjacent to the C2 domain that is
responsible for lipid binding and membrane localization.
Next are two protein sequences rich in proline (P),
glutamic acid (E), S, and T (PEST) domains that regulate
protein stability. Lastly, PTEN has a PDZ domain [PDZ
is an abbreviation for the first three proteins identified to
share this domain which are post synaptic density protein
95 (PSD95), Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor
(Dlg1), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1)], which
helps facilitate protein-protein interactions. Mutations
within the phosphatase domain have been reported to
nullify the endogenous function of PTEN [1,3,167]. Thus
PTEN is an enticing therapeutic target for activation since
it is frequently inactivated in many human cancers through
point mutations as well as other genetic and biochemical
mechanisms [e.g., promoter hypermethylation, gene
deletion, expression of various interacting proteins,
miRNAs, phosphorylation, acetylation, ubiquitination,
oxidization and others]. PTEN inactivation results in
elevated Akt activity and abnormal growth regulation
[1,3,167,172]. Thus, drugs reactivating PTEN could
potentially be useful in the therapy of some types of
tumors driven by PTEN inactivation.
Another negative regulator of the PI3K pathway is
the PH domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase
(PHLPP). PHLPP is a tumor suppressor gene. PHLPP
dephosphorylates S473 on Akt-1 which can induce
apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth [173]. Two
other phosphatases, SHIP-1 and SHIP-2, remove the
5-phosphate from PIP3 to produce PIP2 [174-177]. SHIP1
and SHIP2 are tumor suppressor genes. Mutations in these
phosphatases, which eliminate their activity, can lead to
tumor progression.
Next we discuss some of the key targets of Akt
that can also contribute to abnormal cellular growth and
are key therapeutic targets [1-3,135-138,178-185]. Aktmediated regulation of mTOR activity is a complex,
multi-step phenomenon. Akt inhibits tuberous sclerosis 2
(TSC2 or tuberin) function through direct phosphorylation
[179]. TSC2 is a GAP that functions in association with
TSC1 to inactivate the small G protein Ras homolog
enriched in brain (Rheb) [180-182]. TSC1 and TSC2 are
both tumor suppressor and gatekeeper genes [186,187].
TSC2 has been recently shown to have other roles, for
example when it interacts with transforming acidic coiledcoil-3 (TACC3) a centromere binding protein, it maintains
nuclear membrane structure and regulates cell division.
[188].
TSC2 phosphorylation by Akt represses GAP

activity of the TSC1/TSC2 complex, allowing Rheb
to accumulate in a GTP-bound state. Rheb-GTP then
activates, through a mechanism not yet fully elucidated,
the protein kinase activity of mTOR which complexes with
Raptor (Regulatory associated protein of mTOR) adaptor
protein, DEP domain containing mTOR-interacting
protein (DEPTOR) and mLST8, a member of the Lethalwith-Sec-Thirteen gene family, first identified in yeast,
FK506 Binding Protein 38 (FKBP38) and proline-rich Akt
substrate 40 kDa protein (PRAS40) [134-138]. Raptor has
also recently been shown to have other roles, including
interactions with the rDNA transcriptional apparatus in the
nucleoli [189].
mTORC1 inhibits Akt via a negative feedback loop
which involves, at least in part, p70S6K [181]. This is due
to the negative effects that p70S6K has on IRS-1 [134138]. p70S6K phosphorylates IRS-1 on S312 and/or S636/
S639. This targets IRS-1 to the proteasome where it is
degraded. Hence PI3K/Akt signaling downstream of IRS1 is downregulated when p70S6K is active. Rapamycin
treatment blocks mTORC1 and p70S6K activation, thus
this loop is broken and Akt is activated.
Deptor is another component of the mTORC1
complex. DEPTOR may be a tumor suppressor gene as
decreased expression of DEPTOR results in increased
mTORC1 activity [190].
The mechanism(s) by which Rheb-GTP activates
mTORC1 have not been fully elucidated, however it
requires Rheb farnesylation and can be blocked by
farnesyl transferase (FT) inhibitors. It has been proposed
that Rheb-GTP would relieve the inhibitory function of
FKBP38 on mTOR, thus leading to mTORC1 activation
[182].
As stated previously, TSC1 and TSC2 have
important roles in the regulation of mTORC1. An
additional molecule important in this regulation is the
liver kinase B (LKB1 also known as STK11). LKB1 is an
important tumor suppressor and gatekeeper mutations of
LKB1 cause the rare Peutz-Jeghers Syndrome (PJS) which
is a cancer-prone syndrome [191]. LKB1 is a gatekeeper
gene and mutations in LKB1 are involved in the formation
of hamartomatous polyps in PJS patients. LKB1 is an
upstream activator of 5’AMP-activated protein kinase
(AMPK) which activates TSC2 that negatively regulates
mTORC1 [192,193]. LKB1 is a critical regulator of cell
polarity and energy/metabolism control and exerts it vast
effects via diverse effectors [138,194,195].
AMPK is considered a metabolic gatekeeper
important in many diseases including diabetes, cancer
and neurologic disorders [196-203]. AMPK is activated
by the diabetes drug metformin [193]. Hence metformin
will indirectly suppress mTORC1 activity. Chronic
overfeeding increases mTORC1 activity which in turn
promotes adiposity and decreases lifespan and is also
believe to enhance cancer growth [204,205]. Inhibiting
mTORC1 activity by drugs such as metformin and other
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

drugs (including rapamycin) may not only aid in the
treatment of diabetics, but also improve cancer therapies
and increase longevity [206-216].
Akt also phosphorylates PRAS40, an inhibitor
of mTORC1, and by doing so, it prevents the ability
of PRAS40 to suppress mTORC1 signalling (recently
reviewed in [135-138]). Thus, this could be yet another
mechanism by which Akt activates mTORC1. Moreover,
PRAS40 is a substrate of mTORC1 itself, and mTORC1mediated phosphorylation of PRAS40 prevents inhibition
of additional mTORC1 signaling [135-138,181]. Due to
its negative regulation of mTORC1, PRAS40 has been
proposed to have gatekeeper anti-apoptotic functions
[217]. Also Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK signaling positively
impinges on mTORC1. Both p90Rsk-1 and ERK 1/2
phosphorylate TSC2, thus suppressing its inhibitory
function [135-138,181]. Moreover, mTORC1 inhibition
resulted in ERK 1/2 activation, through p70S6K/PI3K/
Ras/Raf/MEK [183].
The relationship between Akt and mTOR is further
complicated by the existence of the mTOR/Rictor
complex (mTORC2), which, in some cell types, displays
rapamycin-insensitive activity. mTORC2 is comprised
of rapamycin insensitive companion of mTOR (Rictor),
mTOR, DEPTOR, mLST8, Stress activated protein kinase
INteracting protein 1 (SIN1) and protein observed with
Rictor (Protor). mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt on S473
in vitro which facilitates T308 phosphorylation [185].
Thus, mTORC2 can function as the elusive PDK-2 which
phosphorylates Akt-1 on S473 in response to growth
factor stimulation [186,218]. Akt and mTOR are linked
to each other via positive and negative regulatory circuits,
which restrain their simultaneous hyperactivation through
mechanisms involving p70S6K and PI3K [135-138,181].
Assuming that equilibrium exists between these two
complexes, when the mTORC1 complex is formed, it
could antagonize the formation of the mTORC2 complex
and reduce Akt activity [180,181]. Thus, at least in
principle, inhibition of the mTORC1 complex could result
in Akt hyperactivation. This is one problem associated
with therapeutic approaches using rapamycin or modified
rapamycins (rapalogs) that block some, but not all, actions
of mTOR.
mTOR is a 289-kDa S/T kinase. mTOR was the
first identified member of the phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-related kinase (PIKK) family [135-138,219].
Recently mTOR has been shown to be cell cycle regulated
[220,221]. mTOR has been referred to as the gatekeeper
of autophagy. mTOR plays important roles in many
biological processes, including; energy control [222-224],
insulin resistance [225], diabetes [226], seizures [227,228],
protein homeostasis [229], regulation of tRNA expression
[230,231], cell cycle arrest [232], cell differentiation
[233,234], cell migration [235,236], follicle development
[237], DNA damage checkpoint [238], cellular quiescence/
senescence [239-248], cancer [249,250], aging [251-260]
965

and Parkinson’s disease [261].
mTORC1 is a repressor of autophagy, a lysosomedependent degradation pathway which allows cells to
recycle damaged or superfluous cytoplasmic content,
such as lipids, proteins, and organelles [262-280]. As a
consequence, cells produce metabolic precursors for
macromolecular biosynthesis or ATP generation. In cancer
cells, autophagy fulfills a dual role, as it has both tumorpromoting and tumor-suppressing properties. Functional
autophagy prevents necrosis and inflammation, which
can lead to genetic instability. However, autophagy might
be important for tumor progression by providing energy
through its recycling mechanism during unfavorable
metabolic circumstances, which are very common in
tumors [262-280].
A model has been proposed by Dr. Michael P.
Lisanti and colleagues which is called the reverse
Warburg Effect. This model proposes that the aerobic
glycolysis occurring in the tumor associated fibroblasts
and not in the actual epithelial tumor cells [266,270-274].
This results in the transfer of high-energy metabolites
(lactate and pyruvate) to adjacent epithelial cancer cells
which fuel the cancer cells allowing them to invade and
metastize. In addition, oxidative stress generated by the
cancer cells induces autophagy of the tumor associated
fibroblasts which the cancer cells then recycle and use
to fuel their growth. Anti-oxidants (N-acetyl cysteine,
NAC), quercetin and the anti-diabetes drug metformin)
or autophagy inhibitors (chloroquine) will suppress
the destruction of caveolin-1 in stromal fibroblasts and
inhibit cancer growth. Caveolin-1 is a key protein at the
cell membrane which serves to organize other important
signaling molecules into signaling complexes (e.g., Fak,
Src). Decreased expression of caveolin-1 is associated
with a poorer prognosis of breast and other cancers.
Autophagy is also important in hematopoietic
cancer [275-277]. Autophagy can be regulated by
epigenetic mechanisms [278]. Autophagy may also
become defective in certain drug resistant cells [279].
Defective autophagy may be controlled by the p53 rheostat
in cancer [280]. Clearly autophagy is a very important
survival process which is regulated in part by mTORC1.
mTOR regulates translation in response to nutrients
and growth factors by phosphorylating components of
the protein synthesis machinery, including p70S6K and
eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4E binding protein-1
(4EBP-1), the latter resulting in release eIF-4E, allowing
eIF-4E to participate in the assembly of a translational
initiation complex [1-3,135-138]. p70S6K phosphorylates
the 40S ribosomal protein S6, (rpS6), leading to translation
of “weak” mRNAs [1-3,135-138]. Integration of a variety
of signals (mitogens, growth factors, hormones) by mTOR
assures cell cycle entry only if nutrients and energy are
sufficient for cell duplication [1-3,135-138].
Unphosphorylated 4E-BP1 interacts with the capbinding protein eIF4E and prevents the formation of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

4F translational initiation complex (eIF4F); by competing
for the binding of eukaryotic initiation factor 4G (eIF4G)
to eIF4E. 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 results in
the release of the eIF4E, which then associates with eIF4G
to stimulate translation initiation [1-3,135-138].
eIF4E is a key component for translation of 5’
capped mRNAs, that include transcripts encoding
proliferation and survival promoting proteins, such as
c-Myc, cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK-2),
signal activator and transducer of transcription-3 (STAT3), ornithine decarboxylase, survivin, B-cell lymphoma
2 (Bcl) -2, Bcl-xL, myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) and
others [1-3,135-138].
The mechanisms which control mTORC2 activity
have only begun to be revealed. mTORC2 activation
requires PI3K, as inhibition of PI3K decreases mTORC2
activity [138]. mTORC2 phosphorylates Akt-1 on S473
that enhances subsequent Akt phosphorylation on T308
by PDK1. mTORC2 phosphorylates other members of
the family of protein kinase A, G, and C (AGC) including
as serum/glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1) [281].
mTORC2 has been shown to phosphorylate certain
protein kinase C (PKC) family members [282]. mTORC2
has important roles in regulation of cell growth and it is
a critical biological sensor [283]. For mTORC2 activity,
it requires association with the ribosome and this may
a critical sensor promoting growth when conditions
are favorable but hindering growth when conditions
are not favorable [284-287]. mTORC2 influences actin
cytoskeletal organization [288]. Along these same lines,
mTORC2 has been implicated in various aspects of tumor
progression including motility, invasion and metastasis
[289].
PI3K, Akt, and mTORC1/2 are linked to each
other via regulatory feedback loops, which restrain their
simultaneous hyperactivation. Negative regulation of Akt
activity by mTORC1 is dependent on p70S6K-mediated
phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 adapter proteins, downstream
of the IR and/or IGF-1R [290-292]. IRS-1 and IRS-2
are normally required to activate class IA PI3Ks after
stimulation of IR and IGF-1R tyrosine kinase activity.
When mTORC1 is active, p70S6K phosphorylates the
IRS-1/2 proteins on serine residues, targeting them for
proteasomal degradation [293,294].
Inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by rapamycin/
rapalogs removes the previously mentioned negative
feedback loop and activates Akt through PI3K. Inhibiting
mTORC1 with rapamycin will in some situations activate
mTORC2. Recent findings have also highlighted the
existence of a rapamycin-sensitive, mTORC1/p70S6Kmediated phosphorylation of Rictor on T1135. This
phosphorylation event exerted a negative regulatory effect
on the mTORC2-dependent phosphorylation of Akt in vivo
[295]. Thus, both mTORC1 and mTORC2 could control
Akt activation. PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling is tightly
controlled and negatively regulated by several lipid and
966

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 954-987

protein phosphatases. PTEN removes the 3’-phosphate
from PIP3, thereby antagonizing network signalling
[296,297]. Two other lipid phosphatases, SHIP-1 and -2,
remove the 5-phosphate from PIP3 to yield PIP2 [298].
PP2A downregulates Akt activity directly, by
dephosphorylating it at T308 and accumulating evidence
indicates that PP2A acts as a tumor suppressor [299].
PP2A is an essential phosphatase critically involved
in regulation of cell cycle progression [300] and DNA
damage response [301] as well as p53 stability and other
important biochemical events.
Recent findings have indicated that there exists an
inverse relationship between the levels of the B55-alpha
regulatory subunit of the PP2A phosphatase, that functions
as an Akt phosphatase [302] and the levels of T308 (but
not S473) Akt phosphorylation levels in AML blast cells
[303]. This finding suggested that B55-alpha is mediating
dephosphorylation of Akt at T308, but not S473, in
AML cells [303]. Interestingly, this study reported lower
levels of the PP2A B55-alpha regulatory subunit in AML
primary cells when compared with CD34+ bone marrow
cells from healthy donors. Another report has documented
that PP2A activity downregulation is a recurrent event in
AML patients [304]. Moreover, the phosphorylated S473
residue on Akt is dephosphorylated by the two isoforms
of PHLPP (1 and 2) Decreased PHLPP activity has been
linked to specific types of cancers [305,306].
mTOR also controls the translation of hypoxiainducible transcription factor-1-alpha (HIF-1-alpha)
mRNA [2,26,135-138,307]. HIF-1-alpha upregulation
leads to increased expression of angiogenic factors
such as VEGF and PDGF which are important in
many physiological processes including, blood supply,
cancer and diabetes [26,308-310]. Moreover, HIF-1alpha regulates the glycolytic pathway by controlling
the expression of glucose-sensing molecules including
glucose transporter (Glut) 1 and Glut3 [311,312]. p70S6K
and 4E-BP1 also control cell growth and hypertrophy by
regulating protein synthesis. Hence targeting the mTOR
pathway could have many effects on the regulation of
cellular growth.

of breast, 32% of colorectal, 30% of endometrial, 27%
of brain, 25% of gastric, 4% of lung cancers [322-326].
These mutations are clustered in small hot-spot regions
within the helical (E542, E545) and kinase (H1047)
domains [322-326]. The locations of these mutations have
been recently critically evaluated [326]. These mutations
frequently result in activation of its kinase activity [326].
Furthermore increased expression of the Ras/PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway also occurs frequently in some cancers
as the PIKC3A gene is amplified in approximately 40% of
ovarian cancers [325].
Activation of PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR signaling
through mutation, inactivation or silencing of pathway
components occurs in various malignancies, including
liver cancer [327]. Deregulation of this pathway has
clinical importance in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
For example, data from genomic sequence of HCC
samples identified mutations in PIK3CA in 50% of patients
with poor prognosis, survival length < 3 years following
partial liver resection, and only 10% of the HCC patients
with a good prognosis had mutations in PIK3CA [327].
The identified mutations were restricted to residues H1047
in 61.1%, to E545 in 33.3%, and to E542 in 5.5% of cases,
and as a consequence this result in gain of enzymatic
function and consequently in oncogenic activity of PI3K
[327].

Mutations at PTEN in Human Cancer
Germline PTEN mutations are present in
approximately 80% of patients with Cowden syndrome
[328]. This disease, which is also known as multiple
hamartoma syndrome, is a familial syndrome that includes
diverse types of cancer conditions including early onset
breast cancer. Mutations have been reported to occur at
PTEN in breast cancer in varying frequencies (5-21%)
[329,330]. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) is probably
more common (30%) [330]. Mutations at certain residues
of PTEN, that are associated with Cowden’s disease,
affect the ubiquitination of PTEN and prevent nuclear
translocation. These mutations leave the phosphatase
activity intact [331]. Inhibition of PTEN activity leads to
centromere breakage and chromosome instability [332].
Thus PTEN has diverse activities.
Akt and mTOR phosphorylation are frequently
detected in ovarian and endometrial cancers. An early
occurrence in endometrial cancer is the loss of functional
PTEN activity by mutation or other mechanisms, this
occurs in approximately 40-80% of patients [333]. Since
the loss of PTEN results in activation of Akt, that in turn
up-regulates mTOR activity, cancer cells deficient in
PTEN are thought to be major targets of mTOR inhibitors.
Alterations in PTEN expression have also been
implicated in HCC. The best evidence that strongly
supports the connection between PTEN-suppression and
liver carcinogenesis comes from genetic studies. All mice

Mutations or Altered Expression of the Ras/PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR Pathways Can Alter Sensitivity
to Therapy
Mutations resulting in activation of the Ras/
PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathways and play critical
roles in EMT, tumor progression and aging [313-319].
Mutations/gene amplification of RAS, PIK3CA, PIK3R1,
PIK3R4, PIK3R5, IRS4, PTEN, AKT1, TSC1, TSC2,
RHEB, MTOR, and 70S6K are detected in certain cancers
[5,320]. Aberrant activation of this pathway may be a
contributing factor to transformation of diverse types of
cancers [321]. PIK3CA is mutated in approximately 25%

with PTEN-deficient hepatocytes exhibited liver adenomas
and 66% of them developed HCC [334]. In these mice,
hepatocytes were hyperproliferative and displayed an
abnormal activation of Akt [334]. Furthermore, although
mutations in the PTEN gene rarely occur in HCC, frequent
loss of heterozygosity of PTEN allele has been identified
in 20-30% of HCC patients [335-338]. In addition, downregulation of PTEN expression may be partly due to PTEN
promoter methylation [339]. PTEN expression plays a
critical role in HCC progression and patient’s outcome.
Patients with high expression of PTEN had a significantly
better overall survival than patients with low PTEN
expression [340]. Hepatitis viruses protect hepatocytes
from apoptotic cell death by promoting the activation
of Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR survival pathway [341,342].
Among the four proteins encoded by HBV genome, HBx
has been reported to be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis.
It has been reported that HBx expression downregulated
PTEN expression in hepatocytes [342]. In contrast, PTEN
expression in liver cells downregulated HBx-induced
PI3K and Akt activities [343]. Therefore, these studies
suggest the possible use of PTEN as a target in therapeutic
approaches for the treatment of at least those HCC caused
by HBV infection.
Mutations and hemizygous deletions of PTEN have
been detected in AML and non Hodgkin’s lymphoma
(NHL) and other cancers [344,345]. Although many
groups have investigated the PTEN-phosphorylation status
in leukemia and lymphoma, its relevance concerning
Akt-activation is still not clear [344-348]. PTEN
phosphorylation as well as low or absent PTEN expression
has been observed in AML.
The level of PTEN expression does not always
correlate with the degree of phosphorylation of Akt [344].
Although the picture concerning PTEN-inactivation
and corresponding Akt-activation is not clear, in vivo
studies indicate, that PTEN dysregulation promotes
leukemogenesis. PTEN-deficient hematopoietic stem
cells display dysregulated cell cycle progression, and the
mice develop a myeloproliferative disease which leads to
leukemic transformation [346]. In T-acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (T-ALL), PTEN-downregulation is also closely
correlated with Akt-activation [347,348]. To discern
the role of PTEN for Akt-activation, it may be useful to
exclude concomitant causes for Akt-activation such as
mutant upstream targets and to include the investigation
of regulators of PTEN such as c-Myc and Notch/Hes1
[347,348].
PTEN promoter methylation leads to low PTEN
expression [349]. In one study, 26% of primary breast
cancers had low PTEN levels that correlated with lymph
node metastases and poor prognoses [350].
Other mechanisms important in the regulation of
PTEN are miRNAs. Certain miRNAs have been shown
to regulate PTEN protein expression. mi-214 induces
cell survival and may contribute to oncogenesis and drug
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistance (see below) by binding the 3’untranslated
region (3’UTR) of PTEN which prevents PTEN mRNA
translation and leads of overexpression of downstream Akt
[351].
In some cancer settings, PTEN and BRAF mutations
appear to interact. Two studies papers have highlighted
the hypothesis of mutant BRAF- and PTEN-loss-driven
carcinogenesis in mouse models [352,353]. In a study by
Dhomen et al., inducible expression of B-RafV600E was
sufficient to induce multiple melanocytic lesions including
skin hyperpigmentation, dysplastic nevi and melanoma
[352]. Tumor cells from these B-RafV600E mice displayed
both melanoma growth and melanocyte senescence in
this system. Approximately 70% of these mice developed
melanomas that exhibited histological and molecular
characteristics similar to that of human melanoma and
were able to colonize the lungs in nude mice [352]. In
contrast, another group of researchers generated mice
that conditionally-expressed melanocyte-specific BRAF
V600E that were only able to induce benign melanocytic
hyperplasias and were unable to progress any further over
a 15-20 month period [353]. However, BRAF V600E
expression in a PTEN gene-silenced background led to
the production of melanomas with 100% establishment,
short latency and metastasis to lymph nodes and lungs.
This development was prevented by the treatment of mice
with either the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin or the MEK1/2
inhibitor (PD0325901). Moreover, while combination
treatment with rapamycin or PD0325901 led to the
reduction of established tumors, upon termination of drug
treatment the melanomas reappeared most likely due to
the presence of drug resistant melanoma-initiating cells
in these mice. Overall, these two papers further validated
the mutated B-Raf/MEK/ERK and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathways, as promising therapeutic targets in melanoma.

Mutations at SHIP Phosphatase in Human
Cancer
The SHIP-1 phosphatase has been implicated as a
suppressor of hematopoietic transformation as it basically
can prevent Akt-activation [354]. SHIP-1-deficient
mice develop a myeloproliferative disease [355] and an
inactivating point mutation (SHIP1 V684E) has been
observed in approximately one of thirty AML cases [354].
Also another mutation, SHIP1 Q1154L, has been observed
in AML, but was even less frequent (1 of 192 cases) [355].
Though some studies confirmed, that SHIP-1 is a leukemia
suppressor [354,355] it is unlikely that SHIP1 mutations
are a frequent cause of Akt-activation in AML. Disruption
of PTEN or SHIP activity by various genetic mechanisms
could have vast effects on different processes affecting
the sensitivity of different cancers to various therapeutic
approaches.

Mutations of AKT in Human Cancer

Pancreatic cancer cells have elevated IGF-1R
expression and it is well known that Akt regulates IGF1R expression [369]. This Akt effect on IGF-1R has
been suggested to be responsible for the invasiveness
of pancreatic cancer cells. Active Src can also activate
Akt, and both Src and Akt up-regulate IGF-1R expression
in this cancer. It has been demonstrated that IGF-I is
expressed in the surrounding stromal cells but not in
the cancer cells. This IGF-1 expression may serve as a
paracrine growth factor to activate the IGF-1R pathway
and the downstream Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in
pancreatic cells.
Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is expressed at
high levels in some primary endometrial tumors and
is associated with an aggressive phenotype [370]. Akt
is elevated and PTEN is often mutated in these cancers
which can result in Akt activation. NF-kappaB activation
has been shown to have oncogenic effects important in
the control of apoptosis, cell cycle, differentiation, cell
migration and inflammation [371-383]. Akt may exert
its effects through the NF-kappaB pathway and COX2 is the regulator of this pathway. Akt regulates COX2
gene and protein expression in endometrial cancers. This
study was undertaken to examine the involvement of
Akt in the regulation of NF- kappaB and COX-2 [370].
The expression of both I-kappaB and phosphorylated
I-kappaB were increased in the cells containing mutant
PTEN genes. In contrast, there was no difference in NFkappaB protein abundance between the cell lines, which
differed in PTEN gene status. I-kappaB phosphorylation
by the PI3K pathway was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitors
Wortmannin and LY294002. There was less NF-kappaB
nuclear activity, less COX-2 expression and more
apoptosis after inhibition of the PI3K pathway. Dominant
negative (DN) Akt blocked I-kappaB phosphorylation and
decreased COX-2 expression. In contrast, introduction
of constitutively-active Akt induced I-kappaB
phosphorylation and up-regulated COX-2 expression.
When PTEN is mutated, Akt signals via the NFkappaB/I-kappaB pathway to induce COX-2 expression
in endometrial cancer cells. COX-2 can inhibit apoptosis,
increase angiogenesis, and promote invasiveness. COX2 also promotes inflammation/immunosuppression and
conversion of procarcinogens into carcinogens that
contribute to tumorigenesis and a malignant phenotype.
This study demonstrated that Akt signals via the NFkappaB/I-kappaB pathway to induce COX2 gene and
protein expression in endometrial cancer [370].
Elevated Akt activity can also result in increased
phosphorylation of mTOR. mTOR was found to be
phosphorylated in AML blasts, along with its two
downstream substrates, p70S6K and 4EBP-1, in a PI3K/
Akt-dependent fashion [384]. Nevertheless, others
failed to detect any relationship between PI3K/Akt
signalling upregulation and p70S6K phosphorylation in
AML primary cells [385]. This might occur via the Ras/

The roles that Akt plays in cancer are complex.
Akt can be activated by genetic mutations, genome
amplifications and more commonly by mutations in
upstream signaling components. Amplification of Akt2 was observed in human ovarian carcinomas [356].
Increased levels of Akt are detected in carcinomas of
the breast, ovary and prostate and are associated with a
poorer prognosis in comparison with tumors that do not
display increased levels of expression. AKT is a multigene family that consists of AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3.
AKT1 has been reported to be mutated in some breast,
colorectal, melanoma and ovarian cancers [357-359] (see
below). AKT2 is not mutated frequently in human cancer.
AKT2 is amplified in certain cancers (e.g., 12.1% ovarian
and 2.8% breast carcinomas) [359]. Mutation of AKT3 has
been detected in some melanoma samples [360].
AKT1 is mutated in 2 to 8% of breast, 6% of
colorectal and 2% of ovarian cancers samples examined in
one study [357]. This study documented an Akt mutation
that results in an E for a lysine (K) substitution at amino
acid 17 (E17K) in the PH domain. Cells with this AKT1
mutation have not been observed to have mutations at
PIK3CA; a similar scenario is also frequently observed
with RAS and BRAF mutations [361]. This AKT1 mutation
alters the electrostatic interactions of Akt-1 which allows it
to form new hydrogen bonds with the natural PIP3 ligand
[357]. The PH domain mutation confers many different
properties to the AKT1 gene. Namely the mutant AKT1
gene has: 1) an altered PH domain conformation, 2) is
constitutively-active, 3) has an altered cellular distribution
as it is constitutively-associated with the cell membrane,
4) morphologically transforms Rat-1 tissue culture cells
and 5) interacts with c-Myc to induce leukemia in E-muMyc mice (E-mu = Enhancer of immunoglobulin mu
gene, Myc = Myc oncogene originally isolated in avian
myelocytomatosis virus) [357]. This PH domain mutated
AKT1 gene does not alter its sensitivity to ATP competitive
inhibitors, but does alter its sensitivity to allosteric kinase
inhibitors [357]. These results demonstrate that targeting
the kinase domain of Akt may not be sufficient to suppress
the activity of various AKT genes that have mutations in
the PH domain. AKT1 and AKT3 E17K mutations in lung
cancer have been reported to be rare [362].

Alterations of Akt Expression in Human Cancer
Akt is often upregulated in cancer cells and its
overexpression is associated with a poor prognosis.
Increased expression of Akt can result from activating
PIK3CA mutations, elimination or decrease in PTEN
activity or elevated PKC-epsilon expression. Elevated Akt
expression has also been associated with the pathology of
pancreatic, glioma and prostate cancers [363-368].

Raf/MEK/ERK pathway activating mTOR via ERK
phosphorylation [385]. The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway
is frequently activated in AML [386-388].
Akt is activated in HCC, which results in enhanced
resistance to apoptosis through multiple mechanisms
[389-392]. As an example, activation of the Akt pathway
suppresses transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) induced apoptosis and growth-inhibitory activity
of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPalpha). Activation of Akt is a risk factor for early disease
recurrence and poor prognosis in patients with HCC [390].
Several mechanisms may be responsible for the activation
of Akt. The high frequency of PIK3CA mutations and/or
its upregulation in patients with shorter survival might be
responsible for the Akt hyperactivation found in HCC with
poor prognosis [335-341]. Selective epigenetic silencing
of multiple inhibitors of the Ras pathway seems also to be
responsible for the activation of Akt found in HCC [327].
Moreover, impaired expression of PTEN is involved in
the regulation of Akt activity. Activation of Akt signaling
and reduced expression of PTEN has been reported in
40%–60% of human HCC cases [327,335-341]. Some
well known risk factors, HBV and HCV seem to utilize
the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway for the control
of hepatocytes survival and viral replication [391,392].
Taken together, these data suggest that Ras/PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway may represent an important therapeutic
target for the treatment of HCC among patients with
differing etiologies that lead to the development of this
aggressive tumor.
Increased Akt activity due to upstream mutations
in growth factor receptor genes or PIK3CA or PTEN
may actually render cells and patients sensitive to Akt
as well as downstream mTOR inhibitors. The formation
of the rapamycin-sensitive mTORC1 complex in certain
cancer cells that overexpress activated Akt may be altered
in comparison to cells that do not overexpress Akt. In
cells that express activated Akt, Akt may phosphorylate
TSC2 resulting in its inactivation. In the presence of
Akt activation, the mTORC1 complex is formed and
downstream p70S6K and 4E-BP1 are phosphorylated,
allowing the dissociation of eIF-4E, ribosome biogenesis
and protein synthesis. In contrast, in the absence of Akt
activation, this complex should not be formed. Rapamycin
targets this complex; hence the cells that express elevated
levels of activated Akt cells may be more sensitive to
rapamycin than the cancer cells that do not express high
levels of activated Akt. In the cells that do not express
elevated levels of activated Akt, this complex should
be transiently assembled after growth factor treatment.
In contrast, the assembly of the rapamycin-insensitive
mTORC2 complex should be lower in the cells that
express elevated levels activated Akt than in those cells
that do not as there is equilibrium between the mTORC1
and mTORC2 complexes. The significance of these
complex biochemical signaling events is that cancer
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells that overexpress activated Akt or lack PTEN/TSC1/
TSC2 expression have an Achilles heel with regards to
therapeutic intervention as they are highly sensitive to
rapamycin treatment.

Mutations of TSC1/TSC2 Genes in Human Cancer
Mutations in the tumor suppressor genes TSC1 and
TSC2 are associated with a dominant genetic disorder,
tuberous sclerosis [393,394]. Patients with mutant TSC
genes develop benign tumors (hamartomas). In contrast
to Cowden’s patients who have germline mutations
at PTEN where the patients have a high propensity to
develop multiple malignancies, TSC patients rarely
develop multiple malignant cancers, and if they do
develop malignant cancers they are usually either RCCs
or angiomyolipomas [394]. This has been hypothesized
to result from a lack of activation of Akt in cells that have
mutant TSC1 or TSC2 as mTOR activity is expressed at
higher levels which results in inhibition of Akt, perhaps
via the effects of p70S6K on IRS1. TSC1 has been
shown to be mutated in approximately 15% of urethelial
carcinomas (bladder cancers) [394]. RCCs are very
sensitive to rapamycin and rapalogs.

Altered Expression of Components Downstream
of mTOR in Human Cancer
mTOR regulates translation by phosphorylating
components of the protein synthesis machinery,
including p70S6K and 4E-BP1 [395, 396]. p70S6K
phosphorylates the 40S ribosomal protein, rpS6, leading
to active translation of mRNAs [1-3]. In contrast, 4EBP1 phosphorylation by mTORC1 on several amino
acidic residues (S37; T46; S65; T70) results in the
release of the eIF4E [2]. mRNAs differ in their ability
to be translated; the length and sequence of the 5’ UTR
largely dictates the efficiency with which an mRNA
transcript will be translated. Most mRNAs contain
short, unstructured GC-poor 5’ UTRs and are efficiently
translated. In contrast, long, GC-rich sequences in the 5’
UTR often hinder the ability of the eIF-4E complex to
efficiently scan and initiate translation at the start codon.
These are called weak mRNAs as previously discussed.
Consequently, under normal circumstances these mRNAs
are not efficiently translated. However, upon Akt-mediated
activation of mTOR, these latter mRNAs are highly and
disproportionately translated. Interestingly, many of these
weak mRNAs molecules encode oncogenic proteins
involved in cell proliferation or survival (e.g., c-Myc,
Mcl-1, cyclin-D, VEGF and survivin). These oncogenic
mRNAs are therefore tightly regulated at the translation
level and their accumulation in cancer cells strongly
contributes to the malignant phenotype. These proteins are
often subject to the phenomenon of “oncogenic shock” so
970

Oncotarget 2012; 3: 954-987

when an oncogene-addicted cell is treated with a specific
inhibitor the expression of these proteins rapidly decays.
Several key proteins are overexpressed as a
consequence of mTOR activation including: c-Myc [397399], cyclin D1 [399], and VEGF [400] and others. Cyclin
D1 has been reported to be overexpressed in prostate
cancer xenografts and metastases [401], while early stage
prostatic lesions possess much lower levels of the protein
[402]. A number of reports support the notion that mTOR
signaling is a prominent feature of cancer progression and
aging, as recurrent tumors have altered expression of a
number of molecular targets of rapamycin including the
above mentioned genes which encode “weak” mRNAs
[403-406]. Hence mTOR inhibitors such as rapamycin
may be effective in cancer therapy.
One central molecule involved in cell growth is
p70S6K which is regulated by both the Ras/PI3K/PTEN/
Akt/mTOR and Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathways [2]. The
p70S6K gene is amplified in approximately 9% of primary
breast cancers and elevated levels of its mRNA transcripts
are found in about 41% of the tumors [407,408]. It is
known that some PTEN-deficient cells and tumors that
are purported to grow in response to activated Akt are
hypersensitive to mTOR inhibitors. p70S6K activity is
reduced by mTOR inhibitors in PTEN-deficient cells and
transgenic PTEN+/- mice [409,410].

ERK pathway may not be sensitive to either Raf or MEK
inhibitors but if the Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is
activated, it may be sensitive to specific inhibitors that
target this pathway.
Some scientists and clinicians have considered that
the simultaneous targeting of Raf and MEK by individual
or dual inhibitors may be more effective in cancer
therapy than just targeting Raf or MEK by themselves.
This is based in part on the fact that there are intricate
feed-back loops from ERK which can inhibit Raf and
MEK. For example when MEK1 is targeted, ERK1,2
is inhibited and the negative feed-back loop on MEK is
broken and activated MEK accumulates. However, if Raf
is also inhibited, it may be possible to completely shut
down the pathway. This is a rationale for treatment with
both MEK and Raf inhibitors or dual inhibitors. Likewise
targeting both PI3K and mTOR may be more effective
than targeting either PI3K or mTOR by themselves. If it
is a single inhibitor which targets both molecules, such as
the new PI3K and mTOR dual inhibitors this becomes a
realistic therapeutic option. Finally, an emerging concept is
the targeting of two different signal transduction pathways,
Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/PTEN/Akt/mTOR for example.
This has been explored in some preclinical models as well
as clinical trials. The rationale for the targeting of both
pathways may be dependent on the presence of mutations
in either/or both pathways or in upstream Ras in the
particular cancer which can activate both pathways. The
concepts of targeting these pathways is considered in more
detail in an accompanying review [134].

CONCLUSIONS
In this review, we have discussed the various types
of mutations which occur in the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and
Ras/PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathways and how they can lead
to cancer as well as other diseases. We discussed certain
classes of genes important in cancer such as oncogenes,
tumor suppressor, caretaker and gatekeeper genes. It
is obvious that there are many genes which can fit into
more than one category. We have introduced the concepts
of driver, gatekeeper, passenger, lineage-specific and
synthetic lethal mutations so that the reader will have
a concept of how these different classes of mutations
can contribute to cancer and have been used to identify
key interacting genes. We have discussed the concepts
of oncogene-addiction, oncogene-bypass and kinaseswitching and how they can be important in identifying the
key components involved in the growth of the cancer cell
and how they may change during treatment with targeted
therapy. Mutations at many of the upstream receptor genes
or RAS can result in abnormal Raf/MEK/ERK and PI3K/
PTEN/Akt/mTOR pathway activation. Hence targeting
these cascade components with small-molecule inhibitors
may inhibit cell growth. The usefulness of these inhibitors
may depend on the mechanism of transformation of the
particular cancer. If the tumor exhibits a dependency on
the Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway, then it may be sensitive
to Raf and MEK inhibitors. In contrast, tumors that do
not display enhanced expression of the Ras/Raf/MEK/
