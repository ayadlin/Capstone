ABSTRACT:
PURPOSE: The primary tissue-site origin in over 4% of cancers remains
uncertain despite thorough clinicopathological evaluation. This study assessed the
effect of a Food and Drug Administration-cleared 2,000-gene–expression-profiling
(GEP) test on primary tissue-site working diagnoses and management for metastatic
and poorly differentiated cancers.
METHODS: Clinical information was collected from physicians ordering the GEP
test for patients with difficult to diagnose cancers. Endpoints included diagnostic
procedures, physicians’ working diagnoses and treatment recommendations before
and after GEP result availability, and physician reports of the test’s usefulness for
clinical decision making. Patient date of death was obtained, with a minimum of one
year follow-up from date of biopsy.
RESULTS: Sixty-five physicians participated in the study (n=107 patients).
Before GEP, patients underwent 3.2 investigations on average (e.g., radiology,
endoscopy). Ten immunohistochemistry tests were used per biopsy (SD 5.2). After
GEP testing, physicians changed the primary working diagnosis for 50% of patients
(95% CI: 43%,58%) and management for 65% of patients (95% CI: 58%,73%). With
GEP results, the recommendation for guideline-consistent chemotherapy increased
from 42% to 65% of patients, and the recommendation for non-guideline-consistent
regimens declined from 28% to 13%. At last follow-up, 69 patients had died, and
median survival was 14.0 months (95% CI: 10.2,18.6). Thirty-three percent of
patients were alive at 2 years.
CONCLUSION: In patients with difficult-to-diagnose cancers, GEP changed the
working diagnosis and management for the majority of patients. Patients for whom
the GEP test was ordered had longer median survival than that historically reported
for patients enrolled in treatment trials for cancer of unknown primary.

INTRODUCTION

results, when used as an adjunct to clinicopathological
evaluation, on tissue-site working diagnosis, subsequent
management decisions, and survival.

More than 4% of patients diagnosed with cancer
present with metastases whose primary origin remains
uncertain despite thorough clinical and pathological
evaluation [1]. Other patients who were previously
diagnosed and treated for cancer may develop a tumor in
a new site whose new primary site is unknown. Complete
characterization of the primary tissue site of origin in such
cases remains clinically challenging.
Guidelines recommend that patients with occult
metastatic cancers undergo a thorough evaluation,
including a complete history, physical examination,
complete blood count, urinalysis, serum chemistries,
histologic evaluation, chest radiograph, computed
tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and
immunohistochemistry (IHC) studies [2-6]. The
2007 Ad-Hoc Committee on Immunohistochemistry
Standardization addressed several potential “deficiencies”
in the consistency, reproducibility, quality assurance,
concordance, validation, and results reporting of IHC
studies [7]. Even with adoption of such recommendations,
full characterization of the tumor-site origin may remain
elusive [8].
Gene-expression profiling (GEP) for tissue of
origin of biopsy material represents a newer method for
characterizing the tumor site of origin. In June 2010, the
US Food and Drug Administration cleared the Pathwork®
Tissue of Origin Test Kit for formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded tissue samples (Pathwork Diagnostics, Inc.;
Redwood City, CA, USA). The processing laboratory
has Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments
certification. This microarray, reagent, and analytics kit
compares the similarity of tumor specimens to 15 cancer
types representing 58 morphologies. GEP results provide
similarity scores which range from 0-100 and indicate the
most likely primary site from among a panel of 15 tissue
types. The sensitivity and specificity of the GEP test cannot
be measured directly against CUP specimens because
there is no gold standard for their primary site. In a large
multi-site blinded validation study, GEP has been shown
to identify the primary site of metastatic tumors with
sensitivity equal to 89% (Positive Percent Agreement) and
specificity equal to 99% (Negative Percent Agreement)
[9]. GEP provides clinically useful information for
metastatic cancers with poorly differentiated tumors that
complements information from traditional sources, such as
clinical history and physical examination, imaging studies,
histology, and IHC results [10-12].
The principles for appraising new molecular
diagnostics have been evolving since the sequencing of
the human genome [13, 14]. For a laboratory test to have
the potential to improve clinical outcomes, awareness
of the test results should lead to appropriate changes in
management decisions by patients and providers [13, 14].
This study assessed the impact of the GEP test

RESULTS
We invited 316 physicians to participate in this
study. Of these, 152 did not respond to recruitment efforts,
82 declined participation, and 9 consented to participate
but did not finalize data entry. Eight physician reports
failed to meet inclusion criteria. The final sample consisted
of 65 physicians who had ordered and received a GEP test
for 107 patients between July 2009 and December 2009.
Most physicians in the study (62%) were part of
a group practice and 57 (88%) were board-certified in
medical oncology (Table 1). Sixty percent reported seeing
at least six patients per year with difficult-to-diagnose
tumors. Sixty-one (57%) patients were women; mean
patient age was 64 (standard deviation [SD] 12), and
54 (50%) patients were at least 65 years old. Of the 91
patients with a reported Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status score, 87 (81%) had a score of
2 or less.
The tissue samples submitted for GEP testing
came from 19 biopsy sites. The most common sites were
lymph node (21%), soft tissue (20%), liver (18%), lung
(9%), bone (7%), and brain (5%). Participating physicians
ordered 343 imaging or endoscopic investigations, for
an average of 3.2 investigations per patient (Table 2).
All patients had an imaging study; all but 1 patient had
imaging with a magnetic resonance imaging, computed
tomography, or positron emission tomography. That
patient had ovarian cancer, which was imaged with
ultrasound. The most common test, ordered for 85% of
patients, was a computed tomography scan. Overall,
imaging and endoscopic tests detected a tumor in more
than 19 sites, with the most common sites being lymph
node, liver, and lung. Physicians ordered 147 IHC tests,
with a mean of 9.9 (SD 5.2) IHCs per biopsy.
Before receiving the GEP test results, physicians
reported having no working diagnosis for 41% (44) of
patients (Figure 1). The most common pretest tumorsite working diagnoses reported for the other 59% (63)
of patients were lung (9), cholangiocarcinoma (7), breast
(6), colon (5), ovarian (5), gastric (4), and pancreas (3).
After receiving the GEP test results, physicians
changed the primary working diagnosis site for 54 patients
(50%, 95% CI: 43%, 58%; p<0.0001). The number of
patients with no working diagnosis declined from 44 to
17 (25% difference, 95% CI: 15%, 36%; p<0.0001; Table
3). The tissue-site working diagnosis remained unchanged
in 37 (35%) cases. For example, of the 10 cases that
specified lung as the initial tissue-site working diagnosis,
7 remained specified as lung after GEP test; the tissue-site
working diagnosis similarly remained unchanged before
and after GEP testing in 3 of 7 cholangiocarinomas, 5

of 6 breast cancers, 2 of 5 colon cancers, 5 of 5 ovarian
cancers, and 1 of 3 pancreatic cancers. More cancers had
a reported site working diagnosis of colon, lung, pancreas,
or breast after GEP. In contrast, the number of patients
with a cholangiocarcinoma working diagnosis decreased
from seven to three after the test, and the number of gastric
cancer working diagnoses dropped from four to two. The
most common GEP results were colorectal (19%), breast
(14%), sarcoma (14%), lung (11%), ovarian (11%), and
pancreas (10%) tissue types. The most common working
diagnoses after GEP were lung (13%), colorectal (11%),
pancreas (9%), and ovarian (8%) cancer.
Overall, for 70 patients (65%, 95% CI: 58%, 73%;
p<0.0001) physicians changed one or more management
recommendation after GEP (Table 4). For 17 patients,
physicians did not change the primary working diagnosis
but changed management recommendations. Prior to
the test, physicians reported recommending 44 different
chemotherapy drug combinations for 75 patients and
no chemotherapy for 32 patients. Carboplatin plus
paclitaxel was recommended in 26 patients. Physicians
changed their recommended chemotherapy regimens
after receiving GEP results for 58 patients (54%, 95%
CI: 46%, 62%; p<0.0001, Table 4). With GEP results,
the recommendation for chemotherapy regimens that are
consistent with guidelines for the final tissue-type working
diagnosis increased by 23%, from 42% to 65% of patients,
and the recommendation for regimens not consistent with
guidelines for the final tissue-type working diagnosis
declined by 15%, from 28% to 13%.
Median survival from time of the biopsy was 14.0

months (95% CI: 10.2, 18.6), with 33% of patients alive
at 2 years (95% CI: 24%, 44%) and 30% of patients alive
at 3 years (95% CI: 20%, 41%; Figure 2). Median time
from biopsy to requisition of GEP was 1.0 months (95%
CI: 0.9, 1.3). The most common final working diagnoses
for patients alive at 3 years were breast (7), lung (7),
colorectal (5), ovarian (4), and no working diagnosis (4).
Prior to GEP test results, for the 61% of the patients for
whom physicians had identified a pretest primary site,
physicians ranked conventional pathology (including
IHC testing) as the most influential factor for diagnosis
in 53% of patients. After receiving the GEP results, for
these patients, physicians cited the GEP test as the most
influential factor for diagnosis in 60% of the patients;
physicians cited conventional pathology as the most
influential factor for diagnosis in 23% of all patients.
When asked whether the test changed their approach
to treatment, physicians reported agreeing or strongly
agreeing for 52% of patients. Two-thirds of physicians
agreed or strongly agreed that the test results were
clinically useful in the care of their patient. Compared with
leaving the tissue-site working diagnosis unspecified after
GEP testing, being able to specify a tissue-site working
diagnosis or not changing a previously-specified tissue site
was associated with agreement or strong agreement that
the test was clinically useful. Changes in surgical plans,
orders for more investigations, or both were associated
with agreement that the GEP test was clinically useful.
Physicians stated that the GEP test was helpful
because it (1) provided guidance in choosing more targeted
therapy, (2) confirmed a working diagnosis, (3), helped

months. Newer chemotherapeutic regimens for specific
tissue diagnoses have demonstrated increased survival
in patients with advanced stage cancer (e.g., FOLFOX
for colon and sunitinib for kidney cancer). Whether
the survival results observed in this study are a result
of a change in management due to more specific tissue
diagnosis remains a question for future research.
Results of this study should be interpreted in light
of possible limitations. First, physicians who ordered the
test and therefore were eligible to participate in the study
may differ from physicians who have not ordered the
test. For example, the physicians in this study might be
more comfortable than other physicians with using new
technologies, have more financial incentives for using such
technologies, have access to more pathology resources, or
be more willing to acknowledge limitations of existing
diagnostic methodologies. Second, many physicians did
not respond or refused to participate in the study; these
physicians may hold different views from those who did
participate about the test’s usefulness. These factors may
affect the generalizability of the findings. However, biopsy
sites of specimens in this study were representative of
all samples processed by the laboratory, suggesting that
study patients were representative of patients for whom
GEP is ordered. Third, physicians were asked to refer to
data in medical records; our findings are only as robust as
the quality of the participants’ documentation and recall.
Fourth, the scope of the study was limited to determining
the extent to which, if at all, the GEP test influenced the
tumor site-of-origin working diagnosis and subsequent
management plan.
This study confirms findings in the literature that
patients with metastatic cancers with uncertain primary
undergo multiple imaging and laboratory tests, a process
referred to as a “diagnostic odyssey” [19, 20]. This

DISCUSSION
This study measured the influence of GEP testing
on tissue-site working diagnosis and management
decisions for cancers with a difficult-to-diagnose primary.
Participating physicians’ use of imaging tests, other
clinical investigations, and IHCs to determine the tumor
site of origin appeared consistent with guidelines. Despite
these physicians’ thorough clinicopathological evaluations,
the GEP test altered the tissue-site working diagnosis in
50% of patients and significantly reduced the proportion
of unspecified working diagnoses. These results confirm
those of a previous analysis that used modeling to measure
the impact of the GEP on working diagnosis and treatment
for a series of 300 cases [15].
This study did not measure the effects of GEP on
cancer control/progression, patient survival, or quality
of life directly. However, several physicians reported
changing treatment protocols because they believed
having a more accurate tumor site of origin would direct
organ-specific therapeutic interventions and, in turn,
potentially improve patient survival and quality of life.
Survival for patients with cancer of unknown primary is
generally poor; median survival without chemotherapy
is 3 to 5 months and less than 20% of patients are still
alive at 2 years [2, 6, 16-18]. Systematic reviews of
studies involving cancer of unknown primary suggest that
chemotherapy may increase survival to approximately 9

odyssey delays treatment for patients and adds costs to
the healthcare system. With appropriate usage, diagnostic
tools such as the GEP have a potential to help reduce this
burden [21, 22].
Evidence of an impact on diagnostic and
management decisions is now considered an essential
requirement for assessing the clinical utility of new
diagnostics [13, 14]. This study suggested that for a
majority of patients with a primary tumor that was
difficult to diagnose, uncertain, or both, GEP testing
influenced both tissue-of-origin site working diagnosis

and treatment recommendations. Moreover, the observed
median survival in this cohort was longer than that
reported for patients with cancer of unknown primary
enrolled in treatment trials [23-25]. As suggested by
this study, the GEP test has clinical utility because it can
increase physician confidence in cancer diagnoses, assist
physicians in targeting therapies, and increase compliance
with treatment guidelines.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Physicians were excluded if they were not the treating
physician (e.g., if they were a pathologist). Test reports
were ineligible if the patient’s sample could not be
analyzed, the patient was younger than 18 years, the
patient died before the physician received the test results,
or the test was completed prior to the study start date.
The sponsor (Pathwork® Diagnostics, Redwood City,
CA USA) provided a dataset of eligible physicians to the
research center, which enrolled and conducted follow-up

An institutional review board approved all aspects
of this retrospective, observational study (Quorum Review
Inc., Seattle, WA).
Physicians were eligible for inclusion in the study
if they ordered the GEP test between July and December
2009, the test was completed, and they received a report
of the results (similarity scores to 15 tissues of origin).

interviews with all participating physicians. This center
received no patient identifying information.
The list of eligible physicians was randomly ranked
and physicians were selected into a pilot group and four
subsequent recruitment groups based on each physician’s
rank. Members of each group received a recruitment
package containing a cover letter explaining the study, the
consent form, a list of eligible GEP test report numbers,
and online links to the consent form and data-collection
instruments. Physicians who chose to participate signed
an informed consent form and completed a case report
form on patient demographics and biopsy site, diagnostic
studies and results before receiving the GEP test results,
working and differential diagnosis before and after
GEP, functional status before and after GEP, intended
management before GEP, management after GEP, patient’s
current status, perceived clinical usefulness of GEP, and
physician demographics. Pathwork® Diagnostics provided
de-identified GEP test results; the tissue type with the
highest GEP similarity score was used for analysis.
We also obtained de-identified Social Security data
on whether each patient had died and the date of death. We
used this data to calculate duration of survival from the
time that the test results were reported.

researchers independently determined whether to classify
each chemotherapy regimen as guideline-consistent or not
guideline-consistent based on the regimens recommended
in National Comprehensive Cancer Network and Up-ToDate guidelines for metastatic and/or poorly differentiated
cancers, and according to the physician’s final tissue-site
working diagnosis [29, 30].

DATA ANALYSIS

This work was supported by Pathwork Diagnostics,
Inc. Two co-authors (WDH, SHB) are employees of the
sponsor, and both own stock in Pathwork. One co-author
(JSN) is a consultant of the sponsor. Three co-authors
(JCH, RJH, and HRG) are employees of Cedar Associates,
LLC, which received the funding to be the research
coordinating center for this study. Three co-authors (GRV,
MBA, and MGW) have no financial relationship with the
sponsor or with the coordinating center.

The study’s primary endpoints were (1) the
proportion of patients whose tissue-site working diagnosis
changed after GEP testing and (2) the proportion whose
cancer-specific treatment changed after GEP testing.
Secondary endpoints included physician perceptions of the
test’s clinical utility and of patient responses to cancerspecific therapy.
In our multi-level analysis, the unit of analysis was
the patient case for primary endpoints and the physician
for secondary endpoints. We based the sample size
for patient cases on exact one-sided Clopper-Pearson
confidence intervals (CIs) [26, 27]. A sample size between
76 and 137 patients was deemed appropriate to produce
a one-sided 95% lower-limit CI with a difference in pre-/
post-working diagnosis within 6% to 8%.
All study variables are summarized using descriptive
statistics. The proportional change in tissue-site working
diagnoses and management was assessed with a onesample McNemar’s test [28].
Ordered logistic regression was used to estimate
the effect of changes in tissue-site working diagnosis and
in management on physicians’ reports of the GEP test’s
clinical usefulness. After we controlled for age, gender,
number of IHC tests, and number of imaging tests, we
evaluated the proportional change in working diagnoses
and management with a two-sided test. Survival from
time of biopsy was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
product-limit estimator; censoring indicates alive on June
14, 2011. Analyses were conducted in Microsoft® Excel
