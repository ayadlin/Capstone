ABSTRACT
Continued use of trastuzumab in PTEN-deficient HER2+ breast cancer induces
the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), transforms HER2+ to triple negative
breast cancer, and expands breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs). Using cancer cell lines
with two distinct states, epithelial and mesenchymal, we identified novel targets
during EMT in PTEN-deficient trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer. Differential gene
expression and distinct responses to a small molecule in BT474 (HER2+ trastuzumabsensitive) and the PTEN-deficient trastuzumab-resistant derivative (BT474-PTEN-LTT)
provided the selection tools to identify targets during EMT. siRNA knockdown and
small molecule inhibition confirmed MEOX1 as one of the critical molecular targets to
regulate both BCSCs and mesenchymal-like cell proliferation. MEOX1 was associated
with poor survival, lymph node metastasis, and stage of breast cancer patients.
These findings suggest that MEOX1 is a clinically relevant novel target in BCSCs and
mesenchymal-like cancer cells in PTEN-deficient trastuzumab resistant breast cancer
and may serve as target for future drug development.

Inactivation of PTEN has been shown to occur within 40%
of HER2+ breast cancer patients and has been correlated
with poor prognosis, as well as, adaption of mesenchymal
characteristics in vitro[8, 9].
Korkaya et al. have previously demonstrated
that trastuzumab treatment in HER2+ PTEN deficient
cancer cells expands the breast cancer stem cell (BCSC)
population [10]. The unique properties of self-renewal
and differentiation of the BCSC population is suspected
to be responsible for drug resistance [11–13]. Our recent
study showed that continued use of trastuzumab in PTENdeficient HER2+ breast cancer induces the epithelialmesenchymal transition (EMT) and transform HER2+
to a triple negative like breast cancer, which requires

INTRODUCTION
Among the four subtypes of breast cancer 15-20%
of breast cancers are HER2+, which is associated with
aggressive clinical course [1]. HER2+ breast cancers
typically respond well to trastuzumab treatment in early
stage diseases [2]. However, in metastatic HER2+ breast
cancers the majority of patients either demonstrate de
novo or acquired trastuzumab resistance after one to
two year of treatment [3–5]. Numerous studies have
investigated molecular mechanisms associated with
trastuzumab resistance including HER2 degradation,
overexpression of other tyrosine kinase receptors, and
reduced expression of the PTEN tumor suppressor [6, 7].

unique treatment options [14]. Liu et.al. proposed
that two states of BCSCs, mesenchymal-like BCSCs
(CD44+CD24-) and epithelial-like BCSCs (ALDH+), may
exist in equilibrium and can transition between states.
mesenchymal-like BCSCs were reported to be primarily
quiescent and highly invasive, whereas epithelial-like
BCSCs are proliferative, and are localized centrally within
hypoxic zones [15]. Conceptually, BCSCs plasticity could
alter more differentiated cell morphology (epithelial
vs mesenchymal), classical subtype makers, and result
in distinct capacities for invasion, metastasis, and drug
resistance due to the distinct epigenetic state from which
those cells are derived. Identification of dramatic molecular
changes following drug induced EMT in lung cancer has
proven useful to identify potential new therapies following
erlotinib resistance [16, 17]. However, the molecular
signatures that are associated with the transition between
cell states in PTEN-deficient trastuzumab resistant breast
cancer has yet to be completely elucidated.
The purpose of this study is to identify the changes
in BCSCs states and reveal novel cancer stem cell targets
following the EMT in PTEN-deficient trastuzumabresistant breast cancer. Our previous study demonstrated
that parental HER2+ BT474 and the PTEN-deficient
trastuzumab-resistant
derivative
(BT474-PTENLTT) exhibit epithelial and mesenchymal morphology
respectively. Here we identify using traditional BCSC
markers that while BT474 exhibits no CD44+/CD24cells and high Aldefluor positive cell percentages the
opposite is true following the generation of trastuzumab
resistance. RNA-sequencing was employed for global
gene expression analysis and to reveal novel targets
which could be exploited for therapy following EMT
and transition of CSC states. These results independently
confirmed the bulk transition to a mesenchymal/basal like
phenotype, and alteration in traditional BCSC marker
expression.
Interestingly, differential response to the small
molecule sulforaphane (SF) was observed in parental
BT474 and BT474-PTEN-LTT. SF, a natural compound
derived from cruciferous vegetables, has proven effective
at abrogating CSCs in a host of cancers. Early evidence
suggested it is capable of preventing tumor formation
in chemically induced models of carcinogenesis [18].
Further, in breast cancer SF is able to decrease the
Aldefluor-positive cell population, suppress mammosphere
formation, and prevent secondary tumor formation in vivo
[19]. Additional data suggests it can eliminate CSCs and
enhance traditional chemotherapeutic efficacy in prostate
and pancreatic cancer cell lines [20–22]. Together, these
studies support the notion that SF may possess broad
therapeutic potential against CSCs, which provides
a unique secondary filter to identify potential gene
candidates that regulate the mesenchymal state.
Functional gene set enrichment analysis and siRNA
knockdown of several candidate genes revealed a set of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

homeobox transcription factors (specifically MEOX1) as
novel potential targets in the PTEN-deficient trastuzumabresistant breast cancer cells. In tumor biopsies MEOX1
is associated with poor patient survival, lymph node
metastasis, and higher cancer stages. Reduced level of
MEOX1 by siRNA or small molecule inhibitor could
decrease mammosphere and colony formation in vitro,
and decreased tumor growth and BCSC frequency in vivo.
These findings suggest that unique molecular signatures
may regulate mesenchymal and epithelial-like cell states
in PTEN-deficient trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer,
where MEOX1 is a clinically relevant target to regulating
both BCSCs and mesenchymal-like cell proliferation.

RESULTS
Transition from epithelial to mesenchymal-like
BCSCs and bulk characteristics of parental
BT474 and PTEN-deficient trastuzumabresistant BT474
Our previous studies have shown that continued
use of trastuzumab in PTEN-deficient breast cancer
cells induced the EMT in bulk cell lines, increased
BCSC characteristics, and transformed HER2+ to a
triple negative phenotype [10, 14]. However, recent
evidence suggests BCSCs may exist in two distinct states,
mesenchymal-like (CD44+/CD24-) and epithelial-like
(ALDH+), which can interconvert in breast cancer [15].
Therefore, we sought to simultaneously characterize
both populations of BCSCs using flow cytometry (Table
1). The HER2 amplified breast cancer cell line BT474
(HER2+ trastuzumab-sensitive) has a distinct population
of epithelial-like BCSCs with undetectable mesenchymallike BCSCs. However, when BT474 cells were genetically
manipulated by PTEN inactivation through shRNA
knockdown and cultured under long term treatment (LTT)
of trastuzumab, the resulted PTEN-deficient trastuzumabresistant cells (BT474-PTEN-LTT) express primarily
mesenchymal-like BCSCs markers and low epithelial-like
BCSCs characteristics (Figure 1A).
In order to reveal the potential genes involved in
the mesenchymal and epithelial phenotypes, we used
an RNA-seq approach to compare the transcriptomes of
BT474 and BT474 PTEN- LTT cells. While the majority
of mRNA expression was consistent between the cell
lines (19,811 genes, 83.5%), based on the RVM (Random
variance model) algorithm (p-value<0.05, FDR<0.05)
and fold change (fold change ≥2 or ≤0.5), we identified
3901 alterations in gene transcription including 2023 upregulated and 1878 down-regulated genes. Gene Ontology
(GO) pathway enrichment analysis was used to categorize
the significant genes and related pathways. The results
revealed up-regulated genes were significantly enriched
for 3 pathways including focal adhesion, ECM-receptor
interaction and pathway in cancer progression, whereas

down-regulated genes were enriched for primarily
metabolic pathways (Figure 1B). In agreement with two
types of mesenchymal- and epithelial-like BCSCs status,
the levels of ALDH and CD24 were reduced while CD44
was up-regulated in BT474 PTEN- LTT cells compared to
parental BT474 cells (Figure 1C).
In order to further explore the global molecular
changes in PTEN-deficient and trastuzumab resistant
breast cancer cells, gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) was performed on the differentially expressed
genes (Figure 1D). GSEA reveals that the PTENdeficient and trastuzumab resistant BT474 PTEN- LTT
exhibit similar gene expression to cells which have
transitioned to a mesenchymal cell type (ES=0.81,
p-value<0.01). Further, expression of epithelial markers
E-cadherin and EpCAM are specifically within parental
BT474 whereas mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and
vimentin expression is distinctly within the trastuzumab
resistant derivative (Supplementary Figure S1).
Interestingly, the genes which were down regulated
in BT474-PTEN- LTT were enriched in a data set
encompassing genes which are similar in basal breast
cancer cells when compared to luminal (NES=0.76,
p-value<0.01). These data were in agreement with our
recent finding that trastuzumab resistance in PTENdeficient breast cancer cells induced the conversion to a
triple negative phenotype. Taken together, these results
suggest that trastuzumab-resistance in PTEN-deficient
breast cancer (BT474) induced a transition converting
epithelial- to mesenchymal-like BCSCs ultimately
converting the HER2+ cell line to basal/triple negative
phenotype.

parental BT474. Using the MTS cell proliferation
assay BT474 PTEN- LTT exhibited high sensitivity to
SF (IC50 = 11.5 µM) relative to parental BT474 cells
which exhibited no significant response up to 25 µM
(Figure 2A). By coupling the treatment of SF with
analysis of differentially expressed genes in BT474
and BT474 PTEN- LTT cells, it is feasible to narrow
down the molecular targets. Therefore, both parental
BT474 and BT474 PTEN- LTT cells were treated
with increasing concentrations of SF (2 and 10 μM) to
identify dose-dependent changes, and time-dependent
gene expression changes at 8 and 24 hours.
Both BT474 and BT474-PTEN- LTT cells were
treated with increasing SF concentration and duration, and
RNA-seq of total isolated mRNA was performed (Figure
2B). A Venn diagram illustrating the number of genes
down regulated by >2-fold in the BT474-PTEN- LTT cells
under different treatment conditions reveals that only 110
gene candidates exhibit both time and dose dependent
inhibition by SF (Figure 2C). Of these 110 genes only 44
are upregulated by >2-fold in BT474 PTEN- LTT cells
relative to the parental BT474 cell line (Figure 2D).
Three methods were used to narrow down fewer
candidate genes for further study. (1) Real-time PCR was
used to confirm the gene expression differences between
BT474 and BT474-PTEN-LTT identified by RNAseq under identical treatment conditions with SF; (2)
siRNA knockdown of the genes with known biological
function to assess potential effects on cell proliferation
and BCSC characteristics; (3) Functional GSEA using
the bioinformatics toolkit DAVID using all identified
44 genes. From these three sets of experiments we
selected one functional group, homeobox transcription
factors, for additional focus within all candidates (Figure
2E). Among these genes MEOX1 displays the highest
mRNA expression in BT474 PTEN- LTT cells and its
expression was nearly undetectable in BT474 cells (2989fold upregulated). Confirmation of RNA-seq results for
MEOX1 was performed by real time PCR and similarly
demonstrated a 2.5-fold reduction of expression by SF
at 24 hours. Therefore, MEOX1 was identified as the top
candidate gene for further analysis. A summary of results
from functional studies for the top 5 gene candidates can
be found in Supplementary Table S1.

Distinct response of PTEN-deficient trastuzumab
resistant BT474 PTEN- LTT to sulforaphane
narrows down gene candidates following EMT of
breast cancer cells
Since expression of a great number of genes
were altered in BT474 PTEN- LTT and BT474, it is
difficult to narrow down novel molecular targets
following the EMT. Fortunately, our data showed that
trastuzumab resistant BT474 PTEN- LTT responded
selectively to sulforaphane (SF) in comparison to

stroma did not show any MEOX1 staining.
Statistical analysis indicated that positive MEOX1
nuclear staining was associated with poor survival of
breast cancer patients compared to patients with negative
nuclear staining (P =0.019) (Figure 3B). In addition,
MEOX1 nuclear staining was significantly correlated with
the presence of Lymph node metastasis and cancer stage
(P<0.05, Table 2). Further, a Cox regression model was
employed to perform multivariate statistical analysis. The
analyses revealed that Nuclear MEOX1 expression level
(p=0.042), with a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 2.19 and a 95%
CI of 1.029-4.669, was an independent prognostic factor
in breast cancer patients. No significant correlations were
present between cytoplasmic MEOX1 staining and the
clinical characteristics noted above.

8.9-fold relative to nontargeted siRNA control in BT474
PTEN- LTT cells over 14 days (Figure 4B). The role of
MEOX1 in BCSC self-renewal was also determined using
the mammosphere formation assay. Over the course of 7
days, MEOX siRNA treatment led to a 60.5% reduction in
the number of mammospheres formed and the size of the
average sphere was reduced by 90% (Figure 4C).
Given the importance of proliferation and invasion
in cancer progression, we tested whether inhibiting
the expression of MEOX1 in BT474 PTEN- LTT cells
could affect cell growth by MTS assay and invasion
into matrigel. Strikingly, down-regulation of MEOX1 in
BT474 PTEN- LTT cells completely inhibited the cell
proliferation (Figure 4D). Further, the matrigel invasion
assay reveals a 63% reduction in cell invasion following
siRNA knockdown (Supplementary Figure S2). Together,
these results indicated that MEOX1 might play key
roles to regulate BCSCs and mesenchymal cancer cell
proliferation in the BT474 PTEN- LTT cells.

knockdown was employed, reducing expression by
88.3% (Figure 4A). The effect of MEOX1 knockdown

we sought to determine if MEOX1 protein can also be
downregulated by SF. MEOX1 protein resides primarily
within the nucleus in BT474 PTEN- LTT cells in vitro, as
evident by overlap between MEOX1 (Green) and DAPI
(Blue) staining (Figure 5A). Treatment with SF (10 μM
for 24 hours) led to a reduction in both overall intensity
and number of MEOX1 nuclear foci, suggesting SF also
reduces MEOX1 protein expression. In order to validate
if SF was capable of reducing MEOX1 expression in vivo,
immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried after daily SF
treatment (50 mg/kg) in mice bearing orthotopic mouse
xenografts of parental BT474 and BT474 PTEN- LTT cell
lines. The results demonstrates that SF reduced MEOX1
expression at the protein level in BT474 PTEN- LTT
xenografts (Figure 5B, bottom), whereas parental BT474
tumors express no MEOX1 protein regardless of SF
treatment (Figure 5B, top).
As demonstrated previously, siRNA knockdown
of MEOX1 in BT474 PTEN- LTT cells in vitro resulted
in the inhibition of self-renewal of BCSC and bulk cell
proliferation. In order to evaluate if the downregulation
of MEOX1 was consistent with these observations in
vivo, frequency of BCSC and tumor growth in vivo
were measured after treatment with sulforaphane (50
mg/kg, I.P). Along with the accompanied MEOX1
downregulation, SF significantly reduced tumor volume
by 54% (Figure 5C, left, p-value=0.028) in the BT474PTEN-LTT xenograft model whereas no inhibitory effect
was observed in BT474 xenografts. Further, extreme

p-value

limiting dilution analysis (ELDA), performed with residual
cancer cells from primary mice implanted into secondary
recipients, showed that treatment with SF reduced the
frequency of BCSCs within these tumors from 1 in 1300
cells to 1 in 3839 cells (Figure 5D, p-value=0.034). Taken
together these results provide a proof of concept that
inhibition of MEOX1 using a small molecule is a feasible
approach to inhibit BCSCs and bulk tumor growth in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Identification of different breast cancer subtypes
has led to significant advances in targeted therapy with
unique molecular targets responsible for dramatically
different efficacy across subtypes [23, 24]. For HER2+
breast cancers several targeted therapies are currently in
use with the front line therapy being trastuzumab. While
this antibody has proven extremely useful for early stage
HER2+ breast cancer patients, the majority of late stage
(metastatic) patients demonstrate de novo resistance or
will develop acquired resistance within 1 to 2 years of
trastuzumab treatment [3–5]. Several mechanisms have
been associated with the generation of trastuzumab
resistance including antigen masking, activation of
non-canonical HER2 binding partners, or activation of
downstream signaling nodes which bypass the requirement
for HER2 [25–28]. While second line therapies have been
developed for trastuzumab resistant patients, those with
distant metastasis will likely succumb to this disease.

Our most recent study has shown that continued
use of trastuzumab in PTEN-deficient breast cancer
cells induced the EMT, expands breast cancer stem cells
(BCSCs)[10], and transform HER2+ to a trastuzumabresistant triple negative phenotype [14]. These
transformed cancer cells show distinct sensitivity to the
small molecule sulforaphane, which suggests that different
treatment options need to be developed for PTENdeficient trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer. However, it
is still unclear what molecular targets can be exploited for

therapy following the observed EMT and apparent subtype
switch.
The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis suggests that
many types of cancer are sustained by a small population
of CSCs, which seem to be responsible for the origin of
cancers, tumor recurrence, and drug resistance [13]. In
breast cancer, CD44+/CD24- cells or ALDH1+ cells have
both been reported to retain CSC characteristics [13, 29].
Recent evidence building on these studies indicates that
BCSCs exist in two distinct and dynamic states which

may interconvert to form a steady state equilibrium:
epithelial-like BCSCs (ALDH+) and mesenchymal-like
BCSCs (CD44+CD24-). Mesenchymal-like BCSCs are
reported to possess mesenchymal cell type characteristics
and are located at the tumor’s invasive front. Epitheliallike BCSCs are more proliferative and are located more
centrally within tumors [15]. It is possible that the
cellular plasticity displayed by BCSCs, coupled with the
asymmetric division of either state into more differentiated

cells, may ultimately determine the epithelial or
mesenchymal characteristics of the bulk cell line however
additional studies are to determine this are required.
Accumulating evidence suggests that the induction
of EMT and expansion of CSCs may be critical when
cancer cells become resistance to trastuzumab. For
instance, JIMT-1 cells that exhibit de novo trastuzumab
resistance, express relatively high levels of EMT markers
SLUG and SNAIL, and are primarily CD44+/CD24-

. Conversely, trastuzumab sensitive SKBR3 cells are
primarily CD24+ and lack expression of EMT markers
[30]. In another report associated with acquired resistance,
3 month culture of SKBR3 cells with trastuzumab
generated drug resistance and resulted in expression of
EMT inducer TGF-β and downstream target ZEB1 [31].
Further, Lesniak et al. demonstrated rare colonies within
the SKBR3 cell line had spontaneously undergone EMT
to generated drug resistance and the cells derived from
these colonies were primarily CD44+/CD24- with lower
HER2 expression [32]. Numerous studies also have
indicated that inactivation of PTEN may play important
roles in the EMT and trastuzumab resistance. In line with
these studies, our work and that by Korkaya et. al. have
established that induction of trastuzumab resistance by
long term trastuzumab culture in PTEN deficient cells
rapidly induces EMT and expands BCSCs [10]. While
initially attributed to the activation of the IL-6/STAT3/NFkB positive feedback loop, it is possible that additional
signaling pathways may be critical to proliferation of these
cells as well as the self-renewal of the BCSC population.
To further characterize molecular pathways which
may play a critical role in the mesenchymal and epithelial
states, we investigated the transcriptional landscape
using RNA-Seq in cancer cells with primarily epitheliallike BCSCs (BT474, HER2+, trastuzumab sensitive) or
mesenchymal-like BCSCs in PTEN-deficient trastuzumab
resistant cells (BT474-PTEN-LTT). These experiments
identified 3901 differentially-expressed genes between
BT4747 and BT474-PTEN-LTT. Utilizing bioinformatics
analysis differentially expressed genes were categorized
into distinct gene ontology classifications. From them,
most up-regulated genes were significantly enriched for
3 pathways including focal adhesion, ECM-receptor
interaction and pathway in cancer progression. These
pathways in cancer progression included cytokine/NF-kB,
HIF-1α, and WNT signaling, all of which are known to
play a role in regulating BCSCs and have been associated
with EMT [19, 33–35].
In a recent work by Martin-Castillo et.al. the authors
propose that the intrinsic molecular subtypes of a breast
cancer, coupled with the distribution of epithelial and
mesenchymal-like CSC states, can be used to predict the
response to trastuzumab in the wide spectrum of clinically
diagnosed HER2+ malignancies. Within this framework it
is suggested that adaption of mesenchymal traits (EMT)
and presence of CD44+/24- cells would coincide with the
generation of acquired trastuzumab resistance [36]. Our
unbiased GSEA demonstrates the trastuzumab resistant
BT474 PTEN- LTT cells appear to have undergone the
EMT and adopted a basal like breast cancer phenotype.
Furthermore, the RNA-seq data confirmed ALDH1
and CD24 were reduced, and CD44 was up-regulated
in BT474-PTEN-LTT cells compared to BT474. These
results indicate that continued use of trastuzumab in
PTEN-deficient breast cancer cells leads to a BCSC
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transition from an epithelial- to mesenchymal-like state
and support the model proposed by Martin-Castillo et. al.
Due to the number of up regulated genes following
the induction of trastuzumab resistance, a knowledge
based approach to determining druggable targets is
difficult. However, the differential sensitivity of BT474
PTEN- LTT and parental BT474 cells to SF has provided
another filter to narrow down the potential target genes.
We and other groups have previously shown that SF is
able to preferentially inhibit the CSC population in cancer
cell lines and suppress secondary tumor formation in vivo
[19–21, 37]. The efficacy of SF toward inhibiting CSCs
and ability to elicit distinct effects in BT474 and BT474
PTEN- LTT cells make it a valuable small molecule to
interrogate unique molecular targets in CSCs.
Since only PTEN-deficient trastuzumab resistant
BT474 PTEN- cells are sensitive to SF, we chose to focus
on genes that were decreased in both a dose and time
dependent manner by SF. This filtering scheme allowed
us to narrow our search to only 44 genes. Experimental
confirmation (PCR and siRNA knockdown) and
functional classification analysis identified four homeobox
transcription factors as potential targets. Among them
MEOX1 displays the highest expression and fold-change
difference between parental BT4747 and BT474-PTENLTT cell lines and was therefore selected as the top
candidate gene for further study. It is worth noting that
many other genes may also be involved in EMT and
MET, which require further investigation; but MEOX1
was one of the most specifically upregulated genes within
mesenchymal cancer cells in this study.
The MEOX1 (previously MOX1) homeobox
transcriptional factor represents a critical mediator of
normal somite formation in a developing embryo, a
process which requires both the EMT and MET process
[38–41]. In patients, homozygous truncation mutations in
the MEOX1 gene cause an autosomal-recessive form of
Klippel-Feil Syndrome, a disease characterized by fusion
of cervical vertebrae [42, 43]. Recent evidence in zebra
fish demonstrates MEOX1+ cells also regulate normal
hematopoietic stem cell formation in a cytokine dependent
manner [44]. Further, MEOX1 has been shown to mediate
Hedgehog signaling by regulating Gli1/2 expression
during cardiomyogenesis [45].
While the role of MEOX-1 in cancer has largely
been unexplored, one study by Thiaville et. al. suggests
that this transcription factor partially mediates PBX1
signaling in ovarian cancers [46]. PBX1 has been shown
to be a downstream target of NOTCH signaling in breast
cancer, and NOTCH itself is a known regulator of CSCs
[47, 48]. Initial evidence from our laboratory indicates
knockdown of PTEN via shRNA is capable of increasing,
while HER2 overexpression suppresses, MEOX1
expression (MCF7 and SUM159, data not shown).
Together, this data suggests that there may be direct
regulation of MEOX1 by the HER2 signaling cascade

beyond the context of trastuzumab resistant HER2+ breast
cancers.
In order to study the potential clinical application
of MEOX1, TMA staining of a diverse range of breast
tumor samples was carried out. Interestingly, cytoplasmic
expression of MEOX1 was present in the majority of
tumors but limited particularly to cancer cells. Within the
cancer cells nuclear protein localization of MEOX1 was
correlated with poorer overall survival, an advanced tumor
stage, and the presence of lymph node metastasis.
To elucidate the function of MEOX1, its
expression was reduced by siRNA knockdown in the
PTEN-deficient trastuzumab resistant cell line, which
resulted in a significant reduction of BCSC self-renewal
and proliferation of bulk BT474 PTEN- LTT cells.
Further, knockdown of MEOX1 by siRNA was capable
of reducing proliferation of the basal like SUM149PT
cell line by 45% (data not shown). Downregulation of
MEOX1 by SF in the BT474 PTEN- LTT cell line in
vitro and in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model in
vivo was able to effectively inhibit bulk tumor volume
and reduce frequency of BCSCs, as evident by ELDA in
secondary mice. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of regulating MEOX1 using small molecule inhibition in
vivo. However, additional studies may be necessary to
identify the upstream and downstream targets of MEOX1
and its role during the epithelial and mesenchymal
transitions.
In summary, these data showed that continued use
of trastuzumab in PTEN-deficient breast cancer induces a
transition between mesenchymal- and epithelial-like BCSC
states and transforms luminal HER2+ cells to a basal like
phenotype. Using these cell lines we identify novel cancer
stem cell targets in PTEN-deficient trastuzumab-resistant
breast cancers. MEOX1 was identified as a clinically
relevant molecular target regulating both BCSCs and
mesenchymal bulk cell line proliferation. These results
may provide a framework for future development of novel
therapeutics for the treatment of PTEN-deficient and
trastuzumab resistant breast cancers.

Laboratories. Polyclonal antibodies against MEOX1 were
purchased from Abcam (ab75895).

RNA-seq data analysis
Total RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini
kit (Qiagen) and mRNA library was prepare for RNAseq (poly A selection based) using Illumina TruSeq
technology (Illumina). The generated libraries were
sequenced on Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 with 50 cycle single
ended reads. RNA-Seq reads were aligned to annotated
RefSeq transcripts using Bowtie. Only uniquely mapped
reads were used for further analysis. Gene expression is
expressed as reads/kilobase/million mapped reads (RPKM)
and differences in gene expression were estimated using
rSeq. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed using
the GSEA Java desktop software application (Broad
Institute). Finally, gene functional classification was
performed using the DAVID Bioinformatics Resources
v6.7.

Knockdown by siRNA
Small interfering RNAs for gene MEOX1 were
purchased from Qiagen (validated FlexiTube siRNA,
SI00630266). Transfection of BT474 PTEN- LTT cells
was carried out using Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX
vehicle according to the manufacturer’s instruction
following optimization. As a negative control, a nontargeting sequence siRNA was utilized (Qiagen, catalog
number 1027281). Knockdown at mRNA level was
confirmed by isolating total RNA (RNeasy Mini kit,
Quigen) and performing real-time quantitative RT-PCR
in triplicate. Real-time PCR was carried out on an ABI
PRISM 7900HT sequence detection system (Applied
Biosystems).

MTS cell proliferation assay
Cell lines were seeded at a density of 3,000
cells per well in 96-well plates and allowed to adhere
overnight. Cells were then incubated with SF in increasing
concentrations for a period of 48 hours. Proliferation was
determined by MTS assay according to manufacturer’s
instruction by measuring the absorbance at 490 nm on a
Synergy 2 plate reader (Biotek).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
BT474 was cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic
under a 5% CO2 environment. BT474 PTEN- LTT
cells were generated by lentiviral infection to introduce
PTEN shRNA, followed by single cell colony formation
to establish a genetically identical cell line. Long term
treatment with trastuzumab was carried out for greater
than 3 months as previous described [10, 49], and
were otherwise maintained in the same media as the
parental cell line. Sulforaphane was obtained from LKT

1% antibiotic-antimycotic, 5 μg/mL insulin, 1 μg/mL
hydrocortisone, 4 μg/mL gentamicin, 20 ng/mL EGF
(Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1:25,000,000 β-mercaptoethanol
(Sigma-Aldrich). Single cells prepared from mechanical
and enzymatic dissociation were plated in six-well ultralow
attachment plates (Corning) at a density of 500 cells/ml.
After 7 days of culture, the number of mammospheres was
counted on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope and the
photos were acquired with MetaMorph 7.6.0.0.

Secondary reimplantation

Immunohistochemistry and tissue microarray
staining

Isolated primary tumors were mechanically
dissociated by mincing with scalpels and suspended
in Media 199 and single cell suspensions generated by
incubation with collagenase and hyaluronidase (Stem
Cell Technologies). Human tumor cells with DsRed
label were then isolated using FACS on a SY3200 (Sony
Biotechnology) flow cytometer. Secondary female, 5
week old, NOD/SCID mice were inoculated with 5,000,
1,000, or 200 cells for BT474 PTEN- LTT xenografts as
described above. Tumor formation rate in secondary mice
was assessed 8 weeks following implanting cells by direct
palpitation and used to assess cancer stem cell frequency
by extreme limiting dilution analysis.

Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on
isolated tumors from mouse xenografts and patients tissues
on a tissue micro array (TMA) obtained from US Biomax
(HBre-Duc150Sur-01). Standard Envision method was
performed. Briefly, after removal of paraffin in xylene and
rehydration in graded alcohols, heated antigen retrieval
was performed in citrate buffer (10 mmol/L pH 6.0) by
microwave heating for 20 min. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was prevented by incubation in 0.3% hydrogen
peroxide for 10 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked
by incubation in 10% normal animal serum for 30 min.
Sections were incubated at 4 °C for 24 h with MEOX1
(Abcam, ab23279) antibody, diluted 1:100. For blank
controls, the primary antibody was replaced with PBS
solution (100 mM, PH 7.4). The percentages of MEOX1
positive cells were scored using the following scale: 0= no
staining or less than 5%; 1=5-25%; 2=26-50%; 3=51-75%;
4=more than 75%. The intensity of staining was evaluated
as 1 (low), 2 (moderate), and 3 (strong). MEOX1 in
nucleus was defined as negative (combined score from 0
to 6) or positive (combined score from 8 to 12).

Colony formation assay
Colony formation was carried out in six-well plates
layered with 1.5 mL of 0.5% agar (Difco Agar Noble) in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin.
Subsequently, 1000 cells mixed with 0.35% agar and
allowed to set in each well of the six-well plates in order to
form the upper gel. After 2 weeks, pictures of colonies were
taken using a digital camera after staining with 0.005%
crystal violet. Each treatment was performed in triplicate.

Statistics

Immunofluorescence

For IHC staining univariate survival analyses were
performed and survival curves were drawn using KaplanMeier method. The differences between curves were tested
by the log-rank test. Comparison of the variables was
made by χ2 test. Correlation coefficient was calculated
by spearman rank correlation test. For additional studies
comparing parental to the drug resistant cell line, siRNA,
or sulforaphane treatment statistical differences were
determined using two-tailed Student’s t test or ANOVA
followed by Dunnett post hoc analysis. Data are presented
as mean ± SD (n ≥ 3).

Cells were seated in glass chambers slides and
allowed to adhere overnight. After rinsing with PBS, cells
were fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for
30 minutes and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100
(Roche Diagnostics) for 10 minutes at 4°C. Cells were
then incubated with MEOX1 (1:200) primary antibodies,
followed by FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:300)
secondary antibodies. Samples were then mounted and
visualized using fluorescent microscopy with a Nikon
Eclipse TE2000-S microscope and the photos were
acquired with MetaMorph 7.6.0.0.
