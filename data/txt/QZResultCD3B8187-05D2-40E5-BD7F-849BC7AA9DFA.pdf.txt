ABSTRACT
Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites
may modulate the posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression and explain
individual sensitivity to platinum agents. This study aimed to investigate the impact
of SNPs located at 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of MDM4 gene, on clinical outcomes
of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Four SNPs were genotyped
by using DNA from blood samples of advanced NSCLC patients (642 in the Discovery
set and 330 in the Replication set) and were analyzed the relationships with clinical
outcomes. Carriers with rs10900598 CC genotype and rs4245739 AC genotype showed
increased overall survival (OS) than those with AA genotype (P = 0.017 and P = 0.037,
respectively) in the Discovery set and after pooling results from the Replication set.
A combined effect on survival of variant alleles was also concluded and validated.
Stratification analysis revealed that the effect of MDM4 SNPs was more pronounced
in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) subgroups. A reduced expression of the reporter gene
for the C allele of rs4245739 was observed in NSCLC cells using luciferase reporter
gene assays. Taken together, our results demonstrate that genetic variations in 3’UTR of MDM4 gene may influence outcomes of advanced NSCLC by miRNAs-mediated
regulation.

Murine double minute 4 (MDM4), structurally homologous
protein of murine double minute 2 (MDM2), contributes to
cancer susceptibility and progression through its capacity
to regulate transcriptional activity of the tumor suppressor
p53 [5]. The interaction between MDM4 and p53 in the
regulation of cancer was investigated in several previous
studies [6, 7]. As a key protein involved in the process
of DNA damage response, inhibition of p53 by MDM2
and MDM4 can result in delayed DNA repair [8-10].
However, later studies revealed a novel role of MDM4 in
p53-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway and the nonoverlapping role in regulating p53 activity with MDM2
[11, 12]. Considering the previous conflicting reports
about the function of MDM4 in inhibiting p53 activity,
the relationship between MDM4 and cancers needs to be
further investigated.
In the last decades, an increasing number of
researches had been focused on posttranscriptional

INTRODUCTION
In contrast to the steady increase in survival for
most cancers, advances have been slow for non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), for which the 5-year survival
rate is currently 18%. The low rate is partly contributed
to that more than one-half of cases are diagnosed at a
distant stage, for which 5-year relative survival is 4% [1].
Platinum agents combined with another kind of cytotoxic
drugs have been the mainstay of treatment for advanced
NSCLC regardless of various therapy responses between
patients [2]. Therefore, novel molecular biomarkers
are required to be identified for further development of
individualized therapy.
P53 signaling pathway has been demonstrated to be
crucial in regulating chemotherapeutic effects of cancer
treatment by initiating cellular responses such as DNA
repair, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence [3, 4].

significant worse OS (aHR=1.28, 95% CI, 1.06-1.54, P
= 0.012; and aHR=1.35, 95% CI, 1.03-1.76, P = 0.027;
respectively) compared to patients with TNM stage III
and adenocarcinoma. In addition, ECOG PS was related
to PFS and patients with higher scores showed a higher
risk of recurrence or metastasis (aHR=1.70, 95% CI, 1.162.49, P = 0.006), whereas other clinical factors were not
independent predictive factors (Supplementary Table S2).
Using MDM4 genotypes as categorical variables,
two SNPs (rs10900598 and rs4245739) were significantly
associated with OS (P = 0.017 and P = 0.015), but not
with PFS (P = 0.429 and P = 0.302; Supplementary Table
S3). For rs10900598, HRs were significantly lower for
individuals with CC genotype compared with AA genotype
(aHR=0.65, 95% CI, 0.46-0.93, P = 0.017), whereas
AC genotype showed no significance after adjusting for
clinical factors. In the dominant and recessive model, the
association between C variant allele and better survival
was concluded (for CC+AC genotype HR, 0.79; 95% CI,
0.64-0.97; P = 0.026; for CC genotype HR, 0.67; 95% CI,
0.47-0.95; P = 0.025). In contrast, carriers of rs4245739
AC genotype were associated with prolonged survival
(aHR=0.71, 95% CI, 0.52-0.98, P = 0.037), whereas
patients with CC genotype didn’t remain significant after
clinical factors were adjusted. Although not reaching
statistical significance, rs4245739 CC genotype showed
a similar trend of association with OS. In addition, in
the dominant model, C allele carriers had better survival
compared with A allele carriers (for C allele HR, 0.67;
95% CI, 0.50-0.90; P = 0.007) (Table 2). Furthermore, we
included age, TNM stage, histological type, rs10900598
dominant model, and rs4245739 dominant model in
the multivariate Cox’s regression analysis. The results
suggested that TNM stage (P= 0.008), histological type
(P= 0.014), rs10900598 dominant model (P= 0.023), and
rs4245739 dominant model (P= 0.007) were independent
predictive factors for OS (Table 3). The Kaplan-Meier
curves of OS according to MDM4 SNPs were shown
in Figure 1 (Figure 1A for rs10900598; Figure 1B for
rs4245739).
To better define the influence of MDM4 SNPs on
OS, we performed a subgroup analysis stratified by clinical
factors. The results suggested that the above associations
were more pronounced in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC)
subjects. Patients with rs10900598 CC genotype and
rs4245739 AC genotype had marginally prolonged OS
than those with wild-type AA genotype (31.20 vs. 19.10,
P = 0.039; and 32.70 vs. 19.90, P = 0.042; respectively).
Subgroup multivariate Cox’s regression analysis revealed
that relevant aHRs were 0.64 and 0.67, respectively (P =
0.048 and P = 0.047). In addition, the above significant
models of rs10900598 and rs4245739 also showed similar
relationship with OS in LAC patients (for dominant,
additive model of rs10900598 aHR=0.73, 95% CI, 0.550.95, P = 0.020, and aHR=0.79, 95% CI, 0.65-0.96, P
= 0.017, respectively; for dominant, additive model of

regulation of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs)
and their potential effects on the development and
prognosis of cancer. miRNAs are small, single-stranded,
non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression through
canonical base pairing with complementary seed
sequence located in the 3’-untranslated region (UTR)
of target mRNAs [13]. Association between genetic
variations in this region of MDM4 gene and cancers had
been investigated in previous studies. The A-allele of
MDM4 rs4245739A>C (SNP34091) was associated with
increased expression of MDM4 mRNA and protein levels
by miR-191-5p regulation in ovarian carcinomas and
sensitivity for chemotherapy [14]. Another study reported
the regulation of MDM4 rs4245739 polymorphism by two
miRNAs (miR-191-5p and miR-887-3p), and the A-allele
of rs4245739 may be associated with an increased risk for
prostate cancer [15].
However, in spite of the well-known role in tumor
pathogenesis and progression, few genetic variants of
MDM4 had been found to be associated with NSCLC.
To fill this gap, we chose to focus on potential miRNAsbinding MDM4 polymorphisms in order to detecting
variants that alter treatment efficacy of platinum-based
chemotherapy. In the present study, four SNPs located
at the 3’-UTRs of MDM4 gene were selected for further
investigation.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics and genotype frequencies
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
patients in two study sets were presented in Table 1.
In the Discovery set, 456 (71.0%) were male and 382
(59.5%) were smokers. All patients were diagnosed
with advanced inoperable NSCLC and had received
platinum-based chemotherapy, with 40.8% of stage III
and 59.2% of stage IV. Variables of the Replication set
showed no statistically differences when compared with
the Discovery set. Genotype frequencies of four MDM4
polymorphisms were in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium
(P > 0.05). The investigated SNPs were classified by
models including genotypic, dominant, recessive, or
additive. There was no significant difference in genotype
distributions of all selected SNPs according to clinical
factors (Supplementary Table S1).

Survival analysis
Discovery set
The median overall survival (OS) and progressionfree survival (PFS) (53 patients were excluded for PFS
analysis because of incomplete information) for all the
patients was 19.27 (95% CI, 17.64-20.90) and 10.07
(95% CI, 8.61-11.53) months, respectively. Patients with
TNM stage IV and infrequently histological subtypes had

plots of OS were significant in genotypic and dominant
model (P = 0.018 and P = 0.006). However, we failed to

the Replication set was 19.07 (95% CI, 16.44-21.70)
and 7.33 (95% CI, 5.95-8.71) months, respectively. In
this second group, we concluded that rs10900598 CC
genotype was associated with better OS (aHR=0.49,
95% CI, 0.29-0.82, P = 0.007). The dominant model

rate (ORR) other than disease control rate (DCR) was
manifested in 642 NSCLC patients of Discovery set (Table
5). Association with ORR for rs10900598 (for CC+AC
genotype HR, 0.62, 95% CI, 0.39-0.96, P = 0.034; for
CC genotype HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.19-0.72; P = 0.003; for
additive model HR, 0.64, 95% CI, 0.47-0.88; P = 0.005),
as well as for rs4245739 (for CC+AC genotype HR,
0.53, 95% CI, 0.30-0.95, P = 0.033; for additive model
HR, 0.63, 95% CI, 0.40-0.99; P = 0.046). However, the
relationship with ORR was not proved significant in terms
of rs4245739 CC genotype (P = 0.388).

In vitro assay
We used Mirnsnpscore software (http://www.
bigr.medisin.ntnu.no/mirsnpscore/), based on in silico
predictions of SNP effects on miRNA-based gene
regulation, to assess the regulatory effect of the two
significant SNPs. Mirnsnpscore could sorts selected SNPs
and calculates a DeltaS score that reflects the potential
effect on miRNA regulation. In particular, rs4245739
had the highest DeltaS score among the selected SNPs
in the 3’-UTR of MDM4 gene (DeltaS = 0.60 for miR887-3p), while rs10900598 only had a DeltaS score of
0.17 for miR-3173. Hence, we examined whether there
is an allele-specific effect of rs4245739 polymorphism on
MDM4 expression in NSCLC cells by the regulation of
miR-887-3p by in vitro assay. The results indicated that
miR-887-3p can significant lower luciferase activities
in A549 cells co-transfected with rs4245739 C-allelic
reporter constructs compared to negative control in all
the experiments performed. Combining results from all
the experiments, the average luciferase expression was
reduced to 54.1% when considering the control groups as
reference (P = 0.006, Figure 2).

Haplotype analysis
Pairwise linkage disequilibriums for the four SNPs
are presented, respectively, in Supplementary Table
S5. Since the LD among these four SNPs of MDM4
was incomplete in all subjects of the Discovery set,
we hypothesized that variant haplotypes may have an
influence on survival. Hence, we inferred twelve MDM4
haplotypes, three of which had a frequency more than 0.10
and were selected for further analysis. The association

DISCUSSION

lung cancer sometimes have complex somatic mutations
driving treatment resistance when compared with
adenocarcinoma, which may make that modest effect
of genotypes on MDM4 expression is overwhelmed.
In the opinion of my team, any significant association
for rs4245739 CC genotype may be weak due to that
genotype heterogeneity and relatively small sample size
make it easy to be masked. When another replication set
was added, the above results were validated and a more
powerful statistical significance was reached in the pooled
analysis. In addition, we found that variant genotypes
of rs10900598 and rs4245739 SNPs showed preferable
treatment response, which may contribute to better
survival than patients with wild-type genotypes.
The present study has several strengths. We used two
relatively large cohorts from four independent oncological
departments for the two-stage association analysis
between MDM4 SNPs and clinical outcome of advanced
NSCLC patients. In addition, we also evaluated multiple
MDM4 polymorphisms individually classified by models
including genotypic, dominant, recessive, or additive and
collectively as haplotypes. However, we acknowledge that
there are several limitations of the present study. First is
the retrospective nature of the study. Second, although it
was rational to conduct a pooled analysis with two similar
databases, we cannot ignore certain differences such as
different time interval of follow-up and the collection
of clinical information. Third, the functional relevance
of rs10900598 polymorphism on miRNAs-mediated
MDM4 regulation was not assessed because of the low
DeltaS score. Further in vitro functional assays are
needed to verify this genetic variant of MDM4 gene as
predictive biomarkers and to find the underlying biologic
mechanisms.
In conclusion, we have identified SNPs in the
3’-UTR of MDM4 gene among which rs4245739 and
rs10900598 were associated with clinical outcome of
advanced NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy, whereby the minor allele carriers have
better overall survival and treatment response. Further
studies are needed to investigate underlying precise
mechanisms by which the MDM4 SNPs affect outcome of
advanced NSCLC patients.

The principal finding of this trial is that two SNPs
(rs10900598 and rs4245739), located at 3’-UTR of MDM4
gene, contribute to clinical outcome of advanced NSCLC
patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. In
addition, the inhibition of rs4245739 CC genotype on gene
expression by miR-887-3p regulation is demonstrated
through in vitro assay. Given the role of MDM4 as a key
inhibitor of p53 [16], it is biologically plausible that the
MDM4 SNPs may correlate with chemotherapy efficacy
of DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs.
The crucial role of p53 as “molecular police” of
genome integrity detection had been confirmed and
clarified long ago. Modern pharmacology researches
showed that anticancer drugs such as platinum could
induce DNA damage of cancer cells and result in the
activation of cell cycle checkpoints of G1-S and G2-M
phases, which is followed by cell cycle arrest [17]. Then,
the process of DNA repair, including mismatch repair
(MMR) and nucleotide excision repair (NER) is started.
Abrogation of cell cycle arrest will force cells into mitotic
catastrophe or apoptosis and cell death [18]. Since the
dysregulation of DNA repair is involved in chemotherapy
resistance to NSCLC, it has been speculated that mutations
of potentially targeted oncogenes or tumor suppressor
genes should also be taken into consideration [19].
Therefore, variations in the DNA repair capacity including
p53 dysregulation by MDM4 abnormal expression may
play a role on clinical outcomes of advanced NSCLC
patients.
miRNAs have been shown to modulate diverse
biological processes, including DNA repair, by interacting
with 3'-UTRs of potential targeted genes [20]. In addition,
Several previous studies including genome-wide
association study (GAWS) had confirmed the relationship
between MDM4 3'-UTR SNPs and susceptibility of breast
cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and small
cell lung cancer in different ethnic populations [21-23].
These results elucidated underlying mechanism that
variations of MDM4 3'-UTR SNPs could alter the binding
with specific miRNAs and modulate gene expression,
ultimately affect cancer development. Beyond that,
however, 3'-UTR of gene also harbors several regulatory
motifs that determine mRNA turnover, stability, and
localization together with different RNA-interacting
factors [24]. To our knowledge, our study is the relatively
largest investigation of MDM4 gene SNPs in NSCLC
prognosis.
In this present study, we demonstrated that MDM4
rs10900598 and rs4245739 SNPs (located at 3'-UTR)
were associated with increased overall survival in
advanced NSCLC patients, and the results were even
more apparent in LAC patients. This finding may be
explained that patients with squamous cell carcinoma,
adenosquamous carcinoma, or other histological types of

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The Discovery set included 642 patients with
histologically confirmed late-stage (III–IV) NSCLC who
had received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy
between March 2005 and January 2010 from oncological
departments of Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, Shanghai
Chest Hospital, and Shanghai Changhai Hospital. Positive
hits from the Discovery set were validated in patients
with advanced NSCLC from a Replication cohort. This
16321

Oncotarget

dataset included 330 newly diagnosed and histologically
confirmed NSCLC cases in Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital
between June 2010 and May 2013. Blood samples from
all subjects were collected at the time of diagnosis prior to
chemotherapy treatment.
All subjects were informed and provided written
consents to participate in the study and to approve the use
of their biological samples for genetic analysis. The study
was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of each
participating institution.

SNP, genotyping was performed using the TaqMan PreDesigned SNP Genotyping Assays (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.
Approximately 15% of the samples were randomly
selected for repeat genotyping by a different investigator,
and the results were entirely concordant. SNPs were
excluded from further analysis if they had call rates less
than 95% or Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium p-values or
MAFs less than 0.05.

Plasmid construction

Follow-up

The MDM4 rs4245739A and rs4245739C allelic
reporter constructs were generated by amplifying a 640bp fragment of the MDM4 3’-UTR region from subjects
homozygous for the rs4245739 AA or rs4245739 CC
genotype. PCR primers used were as follows: 5’ -AACT
CTAGAGGTAGTACGAACATAAAAATGC- 3’, and 5’AACTCTAGACTGCATAAAGTAATCCATGG- 3’, which
were also designed to include the Xba I restriction site
sequence (T^CTAGA). The PCR products were digested
with Xba I (NEB Inc.) and ligated, respectively, into an
appropriately digested pGL3-control vector (Promega).
The constructs were designated as pGL3-rs4245739A
and pGL3-rs4245739C, respectively. The inserts were
confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Patients were interviewed face-to-face to collect
demographic data including age, gender and smoking
status. Those who had a low smoking frequency (<1
cigarette per day) and duration (<1 year) in their lifetime
were defined as non-smokers. Clinical and followup information was obtained from medical records.
Performance status was determined based on the Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale prior to
treatment [25]. Patients’ response to chemotherapy was
assessed after the first two or three cycles and determined
by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) criteria 1.1 [26]. The disease control rate
(DCR) included complete response (CR), partial response
(PR) and stable disease (SD). The objective response
rate (ORR) consisted of complete response (CR) and
partial response (PR). Follow-up was performed per three
months from the time of enrollment till death or the latest
follow-up. OS was calculated as the first day to receive
chemotherapy treatment to the day of death or to the
latest follow-up. PFS was defined as the time from first
treatment to the date of disease progression, death or last
follow-up.

Luciferase reporter assay
A firefly luciferase reporter plasmid (pGL3control, pGL3-rs4245739A or pGL3-rs4245739C), a
renilla luciferase vector (pRL-SV40, Promega) plus
100 nmol of synthesized miR-887 mimics or negative
control (Genepharma, China) were co-transfected into
A549 cells with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, CA).
The relative luciferase units (RLU) were determined at
48h after transfection using the dual-luciferase reporter
assay system (Promega; Madison, WI, USA) according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Three independent
experiments were performed and each was done in
triplicate. Fold change was reported by setting the scores
of the pGL3-control groups as one and normalizing the
scores in other groups.

Chemotherapy regimens
All the patients enrolled in the study were given
first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The detailed
chemotherapeutic regimens have been described
previously [27]. All chemotherapeutic drugs were given
intravenously, and the patients were treated for 2 to 6
cycles.

Statistical analysis

MDM4 polymorphisms selection and genotyping

All statistical analyses were accomplished using
SPSS version 20.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
Demographic and clinical characteristics were compared
across genotype using Chi-square test for categorical
variables. Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium was tested by
comparing the observed genotype frequencies using a
goodness-of-fit χ2 test. For pairwise linkage disequilibrium
analysis, D' and r2 for each pair of SNPs were calculated
by the Haploview Software [28]. Individual haplotype
frequency was estimated based on the Bayesian algorithm
using the PHASE 2.0 program (version 2.0.2) [29].

Genotype data for SNPs of MDM4 gene were
collected from two independent Chinese populations.
We used the public HapMap SNP database (http://
www.hapmap.org/) to identify the MDM4 tagging SNPs
within 3’-UTR on chromosome 1q32 by using the tagger
algorithm with a minor allele frequency (MAF) cutoff
of 0.05 and a correlation coefficient (r2) threshold of
0.8. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood
lymphocytes using the Human Whole Blood Genomic
DNA Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). For each

Logistic regression was used for calculating odds ratio
(OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and trend test.
Survival curves were computed according to the KaplanMeier method. Cox’s Proportional Hazard Model was
used to test the relationship between SNPs and survival
of patients. For all SNPs with significant p values per
genotype, the dominant, recessive and additive models
were also calculated. All statistical analyses were twosided and the differences were considered as statistically
significant at p < 0.05.
