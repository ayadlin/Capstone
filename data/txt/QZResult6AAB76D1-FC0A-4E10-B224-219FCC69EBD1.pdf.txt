Sirtuin proteins regulate diverse cellular pathways that influence genomic stability, metabolism,
and ageing1,2. SIRT7 is a mammalian sirtuin whose biochemical activity, molecular targets, and
physiologic functions have been unclear. Here we show that SIRT7 is an NAD+-dependent
H3K18Ac (acetylated lysine 18 of histone H3) deacetylase that stabilizes the transformed state of
cancer cells. Genome-wide binding studies reveal that SIRT7 binds to promoters of a specific set
of gene targets, where it deacetylates H3K18Ac and promotes transcriptional repression. The
spectrum of SIRT7 target genes is defined in part by its interaction with the cancer-associated ETS
transcription factor ELK4, and comprises numerous genes with links to tumour suppression.
Notably, selective hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac has been linked to oncogenic transformation, and
in patients is associated with aggressive tumour phenotypes and poor prognosis3–6. We find that
deacetylation of H3K18Ac by SIRT7 is necessary for maintaining essential features of human
cancer cells, including anchorage-independent growth and escape from contact inhibition.
Moreover, SIRT7 is necessary for a global hypoacetylation of H3K18Ac associated with cellular
transformation by the viral oncoprotein E1A. Finally, SIRT7 depletion markedly reduces the
tumourigenicity of human cancer cell xenografts in mice. Together, our work establishes SIRT7 as
a highly selective H3K18Ac deacetylase and demonstrates a pivotal role for SIRT7 in chromatin
regulation, cellular transformation programs, and tumour formation in vivo.
The chromatin silencing factor Sir2 (Silent Information Regulator-2) catalyzes NAD+dependent histone deacetylation to regulate genomic stability and cellular senescence in
budding yeast1,2. In mammals, SIRT7 is the only sirtuin (Sir2 family member) for which a
clear enzymatic activity has remained elusive. Indirect evidence has led to the suggestion
that SIRT7 deacetylates the tumour suppressor p537, although in vitro and cellular data do
not support this model (Supplementary Fig. 1, reference 8). In addition, multiple studies
have failed to detect direct deacetylase activity of SIRT7 on histones or other substrates1.

In biochemical fractionation studies, we detected SIRT7 almost exclusively in a chromatinenriched fraction, suggesting that SIRT7 might function at chromatin (Fig. 1a). We therefore
used mass spectrometry to screen for potential NAD+-dependent histone deacetylase activity
of SIRT7 in vitro. Notably, SIRT7 exhibited highly specific deacetylase activity on peptides
containing H3K18Ac, but had no activity on 12 other histone acetylation sites tested (Fig.
1b, c). This striking selectivity of SIRT7 for H3K18Ac contrasts with the broader substrate
spectrum of other deacetylases such as SIRT1 (Supplementary Table 1) or HDAC19. SIRT7
also exhibited robust and specific NAD+-dependent H3K18Ac-deacetylase activity on fulllength histone H3 in purified poly-nucleosomes (Fig. 1d). This activity was abolished by
substitution of a conserved histidine residue (H187→Y) in the predicted catalytic domain of
SIRT7 and by the general sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide (Fig. 1e). Selective H3K18Ac
deacetylation was also observed in cells following overexpression of the wild-type, but not
mutant, SIRT7 protein (Fig. 1f). Moreover, an unbiased proteomic approach using
quantitative mass spectrometry independently demonstrated that SIRT7 overexpression
induces a dramatic depletion of H3K18Ac in cells (Fig. 1g), whereas changes in other
acetylation marks, presumably due to downstream effects on chromatin structure, were more
modest or negligible. Together, our data demonstrate that SIRT7 is an NAD+-dependent
H3K18Ac deacetylase and the first known deacetylase with high selectivity for the
H3K18Ac chromatin mark.

Depletion of H3K18Ac has been associated with aggressive cancer phenotypes and poor
patient prognosis5,6, and in cellular studies, has been linked to epigenetic reprogramming
during transformation of primary human cells by viral oncoproteins3,4. In addition,
H3K18Ac is enriched at gene promoters and correlates with transcriptional activation10. We
therefore hypothesized that SIRT7 might deacetylate H3K18Ac at promoters to modulate
cancer-related gene expression programs. We first determined the genome-wide occupancy
of SIRT7 by ChIP-sequencing. Results from multiple independent ChIP-sequencing
experiments identified 276 SIRT7 binding sites (Supplementary Tables 2–4), which were
dramatically enriched for proximal promoter regions (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Fig. 2a, b).
Notably, SIRT7 binding sites also overlapped significantly with previously mapped regions
of H3K18Ac enrichment (p-value 1.4e-80)10. Together, these data suggest that SIRT7 is a
locus-specific enzyme that is positioned to deacetylate H3K18Ac at promoters of a select set
of gene targets.

The identified SIRT7 ChIP-sequencing peaks correspond to 241 protein-coding genes (See
Methods for details). Using ChIP-qPCR, we confirmed the binding of SIRT7 at several of
the identified promoters and validated the specificity of the ChIP signals by siRNAmediated depletion of SIRT7 (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 3). Functional categorization of
the SIRT7-bound genes revealed strong enrichment for factors involved in RNA processing,
protein translation and cellular macromolecule metabolism, with diverse links to tumour
suppressive activities (Supplementary Fig. 2). Interestingly, SIRT7 bound upstream of
several ribosomal protein (RP) genes, whose mis-regulation has been linked to cancer in
multiple settings (see below), as well as genes found repressed in aggressive cancers or
identified in screens for tumour suppressor genes (e.g., NME1 and COPS2)11,12.

We next asked whether SIRT7 deacetylates H3K18Ac at the promoters of specific candidate
target genes. SIRT7-depletion led to hyperacetylation of H3K18 at the promoters of the
RPS20, RPS7, RPS14, NME1, and COPS2 genes, but not multiple negative control
promoters (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 4). Consistent with this locus specificity, global
H3K18Ac levels were not affected by SIRT7 depletion (Supplementary Fig. 5). Importantly,
SIRT7 knockdown (S7KD) also led to specific increases in expression of multiple target
genes (Fig. 2e, f, Supplementary Fig. 6, 7), whereas depletion of HDAC1 (which can also
deacetylate H3K18Ac9) did not (Supplementary Fig. 8). Together, our findings demonstrate
that SIRT7 functions in gene-specific transcriptional repression at a select subset of
H3K18Ac-containing promoters.

Author Manuscript

We next asked how selective recruitment of SIRT7 to its target promoters is achieved.
SIRT7 lacks known sequence-specific DNA binding domains, leading us to hypothesize that
it might interact with other proteins that contain such domains. We therefore identified de
novo DNA motifs that are enriched in SIRT7-bound promoter sequences, and compared
these motifs to curated transcription factor binding motifs in the JASPAR CORE database13.
Of the 50 most significant SIRT7-associated motifs, 25 corresponded to consensus binding
sites for the ETS (E26 Transformed Specific) family of transcription factors, many of which
are important modulators of cellular transformation and cancer progression14. The SIRT7
consensus motif was most similar to the DNA sequence recognized by the ETS protein
ELK4 (Fig. 3a).

Although its molecular function has not been extensively studied, ELK4 has been implicated
in both transcriptional activation and repression15. Of the 276 SIRT7 binding sites that we
identified by ChIP-sequencing, 57.6% contain at least one ELK4 consensus motif, a
significant enrichment over total RefSeq promoters (p-value 3.1e-89) (Supplementary
Tables 5, 6). In addition, ~70% of SIRT7 binding sites overlap with ELK4 peaks previously
identified by ChIP-sequencing (p-value < 1e-300)16. To examine the potential interplay
between SIRT7 and ELK4, we first confirmed that ELK4 binds several of the SIRT7 target
promoters that contain the ETS consensus motif (NME1 and COPS2), but not promoters
lacking the motif (RPS20 or GAPDH; Supplementary Fig. 9a). Next, in coimmunoprecipitation experiments, we found that SIRT7 interacts physically with ELK4
(Fig. 3b, c; Supplementary Fig. 10a), but not with two other ETS proteins, ELK1 and
GABPα (Supplementary Fig. 10b). To assess the functional importance of this interaction,
we examined the effects of ELK4 knockdown on SIRT7 ChIP occupancy at specific target
promoters. Depletion of ELK4 led to a partial but significant decrease in SIRT7 occupancy
at the NME1 and COPS2 promoters but not the RPS20 promoter (Fig. 3d, e; Supplementary
Fig. 11a, b), and did not alter global levels of SIRT7 at chromatin (Supplementary Fig. 12).
Moreover, ELK4 knockdown led to elevated H3K18Ac levels at the NME1 and COPS2
promoters, but not at promoters lacking the ETS motif (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Together,
these findings suggest that ELK4 functions to target SIRT7 to specific promoters for H3K18
deacetylation.

We next examined the effects of ELK4 knockdown on gene repression by SIRT7. ELK4
knockdown did not appreciably alter expression of NME1 and COPS2 under baseline
conditions (Fig. 3f), likely because considerable SIRT7 protein remained bound at these
promoters (Fig. 3e). This incomplete loss of promoter-bound SIRT7 could reflect the
incomplete depletion of ELK4 (Fig. 3d) as well as compensatory activity of other ETS
factors in SIRT7-targeting. Indeed, the SIRT7 ChIP-sequencing peaks displayed some
overlap (25%; p-value < 1e-300) with binding sites for ELK1. Importantly, however,
knockdown of ELK4, but not ELK1 or GABPα, was sufficient to impair gene repression
induced by overexpression of SIRT7 (Fig. 3f; Supplementary Figs. 11c, 13). Thus, any
compensatory capacity of other ETS factors is exceeded under conditions of elevated SIRT7
expression, and in this setting, ELK4 is the main ETS factor responsible for SIRT7
targeting. Thus, we conclude that the promoter stabilization of SIRT7 by ELK4 is important
for SIRT7-mediated gene repression. Moreover, this functional interplay between ELK4 and
SIRT7 might be particularly important in settings of elevated SIRT7 expression, which
occurs in certain cancers (Supplementary Fig. 14)17–19.

Analysis of SIRT7-occupied genes revealed a clear correlation with factors whose
expression is altered in various cancers (Supplementary Fig. 2d). This observation, together
with previous reports linking both H3K18Ac3–6 and ELK420 to cancer, suggested that
SIRT7 might regulate transformed features of cancer cells. Indeed, SIRT7 depletion in
HT1080 and U2OS cells severely impaired both anchorage-independent cellular growth in
soft agar and proliferation in low serum, two important hallmarks of transformed cells (Fig.
4a, b; Supplementary Figs. 15, 16). These effects of SIRT7-depletion were associated with
both increased cell death and altered cell-cycle progression (Supplementary Fig. 17), and

were also observed in prostate cancer cells, a setting where overexpression of both ELK4
and SIRT7 has been observed (Supplementary Fig. 14)20. Importantly, functional
reconstitution assays revealed that the catalytic activity of SIRT7 is necessary for
maintenance of the cancer cell-specific growth properties (Fig. 4a, b; Supplementary Fig.
16), linking the biochemical activity and cancer-related functions of SIRT7. In addition,
simultaneous expression of SIRT7 and ELK4 had a synergistic effect on maintenance of the
transformed phenotype of these cells (Supplementary Fig. 18), further highlighting the
importance of the molecular interplay between SIRT7 and ELK4.

The adenoviral E1A oncoprotein induces a specific decrease in H3K18 acetylation that is
important for its transforming activity3,4. Strikingly, SIRT7 depletion in HT1080 cells
severely inhibited this E1A-dependent reduction of H3K18Ac (Fig. 4c). Moreover,
expression of E1A in non-dividing, contact-inhibited primary human fibroblasts triggers
cell-cycle re-entry and escape from contact inhibition, another hallmark of oncogenic
transformation21, and SIRT7 depletion abolished this effect (Fig. 4d). Thus, SIRT7 is
required for both the global H3K18Ac deacetylation and escape from contact inhibition that
are induced by the E1A oncoprotein. Finally, we examined the effect of SIRT7-knockdown
on tumor growth using subcutaneous xenografts of U251 cancer cells in mice, and found
that tumour formation was severely impaired by SIRT7 depletion (Fig. 4e, f; Supplementary
Fig. 19). Together, our data suggest that H3K18Ac-specific deacetylation by SIRT7 is
important for maintaining fundamental properties of the cancer cell phenotype and
stabilizing the tumourigenicity of human cancer cells in vivo.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have demonstrated that SIRT7 is a promoter-associated, highly selective
H3K18Ac deacetylase that mediates transcriptional repression and stabilizes cancer cell
phenotypes. These findings suggest that pathological up-regulation of SIRT7 in cancer cells
may contribute to the malignant phenotype of certain tumours. Indeed, SIRT7
overexpression is observed in multiple cancer tissues (Supplementary Fig. 14)17–19, and the
cBio Cancer Genomics Portal has reported 55 separate instances of SIRT7 gene
amplification in patient tumors to date (http://www.cbioportal.org). We note that while
SIRT7 is important for maintaining the transformed state of cancer cells, we have not
observed a role for SIRT7 in initiating the process of cellular transformation itself. For
example, overexpression of SIRT7 in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts or primary
human fibroblasts did not lead to oncogenic transformation (data not shown, and
reference 8). Thus, our data suggest models in which H3K18Ac deacetylation by SIRT7
modulates the epigenetic stability and tumourigenicity of cancer cells, but how SIRT7
deficiency impacts on tumor initiation and the overall incidence of cancer is likely more
complex.

Our observation that SIRT7 represses several RP genes is intriguing, as mutations in RP
genes have been linked to cancer progression22,23. For example, the SIRT7 target gene
RPS14 is a disease gene of the human 5q− syndrome, a myelodysplastic disorder that
frequently progresses to acute myeloid leukemia23, and multiple RPs have been identified as
haploinsufficient tumor suppressors in zebrafish22. The molecular mechanisms underlying
the links between RP protein insufficiency and cancer are unclear, but have been

hypothesized to involve imbalances in translation regulation or translation-independent
functions of individual RPs22,23.

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have found that SIRT7 promotes ribosomal RNA transcription24, although
this function appears to be specific to cell-type or experimental conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 20). Whether such an activity functions in parallel to, or as a consequence of, SIRT7’s
role in RP gene repression remains to be elucidated, but may suggest a broad role for SIRT7
in coordinating the cellular translation machinery. Interestingly, RP gene deletions and
inhibition of translation have also been linked to lifespan extension in numerous model
organisms, including mammals24,25, suggesting that gene repression by SIRT7 might also
influence ageing-related cellular processes. Consistent with this hypothesis, one strain of
Sirt7-deficient mice exhibits cardiac defects and shortened lifespan8, although this
phenotype appears to depend on genetic background26. Future work should shed light on the
potential role of SIRT7 in ageing-associated pathologies and lifespan determination.

Double-stranded siRNAs were purchased from Thermo Scientific. For retroviral packaging,
293T cells were co-transfected with pVPack-VSV-G, pVPack-GP (Stratagene) and the
SIRT7 knockdown or pSUPERretro control constructs, and viral supernatant was harvested
after 48 hours. For transduction, cells were incubated with virus-containing supernatant in
the presence of 8 µg/mL polybrene. After 48 hours, infected cells were selected for 72 hours
with puromycin (2 µg/mL) or hygromycin (200 µg/mL). Antibodies and PCR primer details
are provided in Supplementary Tables 7 and 8. Adenovirus expressing the small E1A gene
alone was generated and used to infect IMR90 cells using the Virapower Adenovirus System
(Invitrogen) per the manufacturer’s instructions. Anchorage-independent growth was
measured as previously described30. Annexin V analysis was performed using the FITC
Annexin Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Pharmingen), on S7KD and control U2OS cells
cultured in 1% serum. For cell cycle analysis, S7KD and control HT1080 cells were pulsed

Pharmingen) and propidium iodide, as previously described28. Flow cytometry data were
acquired using a FACS LSRFortessa flow cytometer and FACS Diva software (BD
Biosciences), and analyzed with CellQuest-Pro software (BD Biosciences). For analysis of
H3K18Ac in E1A expressing cells, HT1080 cells were treated with control or SIRT7
siRNAs for 24 hours, then transfected with control (empty vector) or E1A-expressing
vectors. Forty-eight hours after siRNA transfection, extracts were prepared and analyzed by
western blot. Relative levels of H3K18Ac (rel. H3K18Ac) were determined by quantifying
H3K18Ac western blot band intensities using ImageJ software, and normalizing to total H3
band intensities. Samples expressing E1A were set relative to their matched control.

Histone deacetylation assays

Author Manuscript

In vitro histone deacetylation assays were performed as previously described28. Purification
of human SIRT7 protein from baculovirus-infected insect cells was described previously8.
Calf thymus histones were obtained from Roche, and poly-nucleosomes were purified from
HeLa cells as previously described33. Histone peptides were synthesized at the Yale W. M.
Keck peptide synthesis facility, and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was
performed at the Stanford University Vincent Coates Foundation Mass Spectrometry
Laboratory. To determine histone acetylation levels in cells, 293T cells were transiently
transfected with pcDNA 3.1 vectors containing FLAG-tagged wild-type SIRT7, the SIRT7HY catalytic mutant, or an empty vector. Whole-cell lysates were harvested after 48 hours.
Western blot analysis of histone acetylation levels was performed with modification-specific
antibodies.

Quantitative mass spectrometry

Author Manuscript

Acid-extracted total histones were subjected to chemical derivatization using D0-proionic
anhydride and digestion with trypsin at a substrate to enzyme ratio of 10:1 for 6 hours at
37°C as previously described34. An additional round of propionylation was performed on
the digested peptides, with one sample being derivatized with the same D0-propionic
anhydride reagent, and the other being derivatized with D10-propionic anhydride for
quantitative proteomics as previously described35. D10-propionic anhydride introduces a 5
Da shift by derivatization of the free N-termini of all peptides generated from the trypsin
digest. Equal amounts of both samples as quantified earlier by a Bradford assay were mixed
together, and digested peptides were desalted using homemade STAGE tips as reported
earlier36. Desalted peptides were loaded onto fused silica microcapillary column (75 µm)
packed with C18 resin constructed with an ESI tip through an Eksigent AS-2 autosampler
(Eksigent Technologies Inc., Dublin, CA) at a rate of ~200 nL/minute. Peptides were eluted
using a 5–35% solvent B gradient for 60 minutes (solvent A= 0.1 M acetic acid, solvent B =
70% MeCN in 0.1 M acetic acid). Nanoflow LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on an
Orbitrap mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) taking a full mass
spectrum at 30,000 resolution in the Orbitrap and seven data-dependent MS/MS spectra in
the ion trap. All MS and MS/MS spectra were manually verified and quantified.
ChIP-sequencing and computational analysis

Author Manuscript

ChIP for ChIP-sequencing analysis was performed as previously described37. Four ChIP
samples were sequenced using Illumina Solexa Genome Analyzer II single end sequencing
protocol, including two SIRT7 replicates and two input control replicates. Sequencing
adapters and low-quality reads were removed, and the trimmed reads were aligned to human
reference genome hg18 by GAII data processing pipeline, allowing up to 2 mismatches. The
biological replicates of SIRT7 ChIP-sequencing were first analyzed individually to measure
the reproducibility. The result indicated that the two biological replicates were very similar
and met all the NIH ENCODE data quality guidelines for high reproducibility
(Supplementary Table 4). The uniquely mapped reads from replicates of SIRT7 and input
control samples were pooled respectively and processed by MACS (version 1.3.6)38 to
generate the whole-genome ChIP-sequencing profiles, with the “--diag” option enabled for

the sequencing depth saturation test. Clonal reads were automatically removed by MACS. In
total 276 SIRT7 binding sites were identified with p-value cut off 1e-8. The wig files were
normalized to 10,000,000 total tag number and converted into bigwig format for
visualization. The SIRT7 target genes were identified by detecting the SIRT7 binding peaks
within 3 kb upstream to 3 kb downstream of transcription start sites (TSS’s) of RefSeq genes
using CEAS35. In total, 253 target genes were identified, including 241 protein-coding
genes. The GO analysis was performed using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.7 (http://
david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov) 39,40.

Author Manuscript

The cancer gene association study was performed using the Oncomine database (http://
www.oncomine.org). For identification of ELK4 ChIP-sequencing target genes, the ChIPsequencing reads from O'Geen et al. (GSE24685)16, were remapped to hg18, and peaks were
called using MACS (Supplementary Table 9). The target genes were identified by searching
for ELK4 peaks 3 kb up- and downstream of TSS’s.
De novo motifs with sizes from 6 to 15 nucleotides were searched within SIRT7 binding
sites using MDModule41, with repetitive regions masked and running parameters “-s 100 -t
50”. The top 50 detected de novo motifs (top 5 of each motif size) were recorded and
compared with JASPAR motif database using STAMP with default settings42. The position
weight matrix of the ELK4 motif (Supplementary Table 6) was remapped to the identified
SIRT7 peaks using cisgenome34, with parameter “–r 30”.
ChIP and mRNA analysis

Author Manuscript

Cells were prepared for ChIP as previously described29, with the exception that DNA was
washed and eluted using a PCR purification kit (Qiagen) rather than by phenol-chloroform
extraction. Whole mRNA was purified from cells using the RNEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen).
Quantitative RT-PCR was performed using the Roche Universal ProbeLibrary System with
a LightCycler 480 II (Roche), or using Taqman Gene Expression Assays (Applied
Biosystems) on a 7300 Real Time PCR machine (Applied Biosystems). Pre-rRNA custom

Equal numbers of U251 cells expressing luciferase and either control (pSR) or SIRT7
knockdown (S7KD) vectors (upper quadrants: 4 × 106 pSR or S7KD1 cells; lower
quadrants: 8 × 106 pSR or S7KD2 cells) were implanted on the backs of RAG knockout
mice. Tumour growth was monitored using calipers and visualized using a bioluminescencebased IVIS system (Caliper LifeSciences).
