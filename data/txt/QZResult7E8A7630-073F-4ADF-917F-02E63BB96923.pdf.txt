ABSTRACT
Tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), as one of
the most promising targeted drug for new cancer therapeutics, is limited in clinical
application by the evolution of resistance in many cancer cell lines, especially in
malignant melanoma. Thus, it is urgently needed to identify chemosensitizers to
enhance the apoptotic inducing efﬁcacy of TRAIL and overcome resistance of malignant
melanoma cells. Herein, we reported that 3,3′-diselenodipropionic acid (DSeA), a
Selenocysteine derivative, could synergistically enhance the growth inhibitory effect
of TRAIL on A375 melanoma cells though induction of ROS-dependent apoptosis
with involvement of PTEN-mediated Akt inactivation and DNA damage-mediated p53
phosphorylation, which subsequently activated mitochondrial and death receptor
apoptotic pathways. Moreover, silencing of p53 down-regulated the expression levels
of p53-inducible genes, and effectively blocked the cell apoptosis. Suppression of PI3K
signiﬁcantly increased the apoptotic cell death. In contrast, antioxidants effectively
reversed the cell apoptosis through regulation of Akt and p53 signaling pathways.
Taken together, the combination of DSeA and TRAIL could be a novel strategy to
overcome TRAIL resistance in malignant melanoma, and DSeA may be candidates for
further evaluation as a chemosensitizer in clinical trails.

INTRODUCTION

to be a superior treatment strategy that offers the potential
for lowering the dose of chemotherapeutic drugs to
reduce severe side effects.[4-7] Accumulative evidences
suggested that the therapeutic targets for melanoma are
the induction of apoptosis and suppression of survival
pathways [1, 8]. Thus, it is badly needed to identify
chemosensitizers to enhance the apoptotic inducing
efﬁcacy of clinical chemotherapeutic drugs and overcome
multi-drug resistance (MDR) to kill malignant melanoma
cells.
Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), as a member of the TNF family of
proteins, has received a great deal of attention recently as
novel therapeutic agents due to it induces apoptosis in a
wide variety of transformed cells but not in normal cells

The increased incidence of malignant melanoma
in the last decades, its high mortality and pronounced
therapy resistance pose an enormous challenge [1]. Most
advanced melanomas respond poorly to radiotherapy and
chemotherapy and no effective therapy exists to inhibit
the metastatic spread of this cancer [2]. Nowadays, most
cancer therapies involve multiple agents, as it is almost
universally the case that single drugs or single-target
drugs is no longer appropriate for treatment of melanoma,
owing to increasing dosage in the clinic has resulted in
high toxicity, drug resistance, and unavoidable side effects
[3]. Recently, combination chemotherapy has been found

in vitro and in vivo [9, 10]. Interaction of TRAIL with
its specific receptors is capable of transducing apoptotic
signal. Death receptors (DR4, DR5) are characterized by
an intracellular death domain that facilitates assembly
of the death-inducing signaling complexes (DISC) and
subsequent activation of a caspase cascade, whereas the
other three (TRAIL-R3, TRAIL-R4, and OPG) are decoy
receptors, which possess dominant negative effects by
competing with DR4 and DR5 for TRAIL interaction. On
the other hand, Bid, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member,
is also cleaved by caspase-8 or caspase-10 and then
activates the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway.
Accordingly, the TRAIL-mediated death receptor pathway
is considered to be an attractive candidate for cancer
chemotherapy. Up to half of tumor cell lines, however,
display resistance to TRAIL [11] and this resistance
appears to be mediated through the regulation of cFLIP,
Bcl-2 family members, IAP proteins, and activation of
PI3K/Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)
survival pathway [12-14], which suggesting that treatment
with TRAIL alone may be insufﬁcient for cancer therapy.
Therefore, agents are urgently needed that can sensitize
the cancer cells to TRAIL. In this regard, a number of
studies have shown the amplifying effect of anticancer
drugs on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis via distinct signaling
pathways [15-18].
Selenium (Se), an essential nonmetallic trace
element, is a key component of several major metabolic
pathways in human, including thyroid hormone
metabolism, antioxidant defence system and immune
function [19]. The role of selenocompounds as potential
cancer chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents
has been supported by epidemiological, preclinical
and clinicalstudies [20]. Recent studies suggested
that Selenocysteine (SeC), a nutritionally available
selenoamino acid, exhibits potential applications in
chemotherapy. In our previous works, SeC has been
identiﬁed as a novel agent with stronger antiproliferative
effect against human cancer cells through the induction of
apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and also be able to synergize
with chemo-therapeutic agents. For instance, SeC inhibits
the growth of human melanoma cells in vivo and in vitro
through induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis [21]. The
combination of SeC and AF synergistically inhibited the
growth of human breast cancer cells through induction of
apoptosis by targeting TrxR [22]. Nevertheless, the poor
solubility and stability limits the clinical application of
SeC. Interestingly, 3, 3′-Diselenodipropionic acid (DSeA),
a simple, stable, and water-soluble diselenide, possess
similar structure with SeC, and has been reported for
radioprotection, immuna-modulatory and anti-apoptosis
[23, 24]. The molecular signaling involved in DSeAmediated anti-cancer activity has never been investigated
in any type of cancer cell lines. However, the previous
results about the anticancer action of SeC prompted us
to hypothesize that DSeA might have the potential to
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibit cancer cell growth or sensitize the cancer cells to
chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we report, for the first time,
that DSeA synergistically enhances the apoptotic inducing
efficacy of TRAIL in A375 cells but not in normal cells.
The underlying molecular mechanisms through which they
caused the cancer cell death were also elucidated. Taken
together, our results demonstrate that, the combination of
DSeA and TRAIL could be a novel strategy to overcome
TRAIL resistance in malignant melanoma, and DSeA may
be candidates for further evaluation as a chemosensitizer
in clinical trails.

RESULTS
DSeA synergistically enhances the anticancer
efficacy of TRAIL
In the present study, human melanoma A375 cells,
a TRAIL-resistance cell line was chose to evaluate
the antiproliferative effects of combined DSeA (Fig.
1A) and TRAIL treatment by MTT assay. Firstly, the
treatment of A375 cells with 10-320 µM DSeA for 6,
12, 24, 36 and 48 h or 10-1280 ng/ml TRAIL for 24 h
inhibited cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent
manner. In order to establish an optimal strategy in the
combined treatment, cells were pretreated with different
concentrations of DSeA for 0, 6, 12 and 24 h, and then
co-treated with different concentrations of TRAIL
for additional 24 h. As shown in Fig. 1B and Fig. 1C,
pretreatment of cells with 20, 40 µM DSeA for 24 h
and then co-treatment with 40 ng/ml TRAIL for 24 h
significantly inhibits cell proliferation at 45.3% and
14.0%, respectively, indicating that the DSeA pretreatment
notably enhances the growth inhibitory efficacy of TRAIL
in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Despite the notable
antiproliferative effects, the combined treatment with
DSeA and TRAIL exhibited lower cytotoxicity towards
human normal cell lines HK-2 and L02 (Fig. 1D).
To determine the interaction between DSeA and
TRAIL, the growth inhibition of individual and combined
treatments was evaluated by isobologram analysis. The
growth inhibitory effect of combined DSeA and TRAIL
treatment under different ratios (1:4 and 1:2) were
found to be statistically synergistic, as evidenced by the
location of the data points in the isobologram being far
below from the line defining additive effect (Fig. 1E). In
addition, the combination index (CI) of the co-treatments
were calculated at 0.27 (1:2) and 0.30 (1:4) in Fig. 1F,
which further confirmed the significant synergistic effects
between DSeA and TRAIL. Therefore, DSeA could act
as an efficient agent to overcome the TRAIL resistance in
A375 cells.

instance, the sub-G1 population was slightly alternated
after DSeA and TRAIL treatment alone, whereas
noticeably potentiated from 0.7% to 56.5% and 91.2%
after co-treatment with 20, 40 μM DSeA and 40 ng/ml
TRAIL. However, no significant changes in cell cycle
distribution were observed in the results (Fig. 2A). In order

to further prove these findings, enzymatic labeling assay
(TUNEL) and DAPI co-staining assay were carried out
to detect DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation.
Results shown in Fig. 2C revealed a remarkably increase
in DNA fragmentation and nuclear condensation in
A375 cells induced by the co-treatment. These results

demonstrate that the combined treatment-induced growth
inhibition is mainly caused by induction of apoptosis.
Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2D, the co-treatment induced
noticeable activation of caspase-3, -8 and -9 in A375
cells, which demonstrate that both intrinsic and extrinsic
apoptotic pathways were involved in co-treatment-induced
apoptosis. To further confirm this hypothesis, Western
blot analysis was used to examine activation of caspases
and PARP, a biochemical marker of cells undergoing
apoptosis. Results in Fig. 2E showed that the combined
treatment effectively triggered the cleavage of PARP
and activation of caspase-3, -9, -8 and -10. Furthermore,
increase in expression levels of death receptor signaling
pathways-related proteins, including death receptors
(DR5, Fas and TNF-R1), adaptor protein (TRADD) and
truncation of Bid (t-Bid), a death agonist member of BH3
domain-only protein family, were also observed in the
combined treatment (Fig. 2F), which further confirmed the

activation of death receptor-mediated extrinsic pathway in
cell apoptosis.

Induction of mitochondrial dysfunction by
regulating the expression of Bcl-2 family
members.
Mitochondria act as a point of integration for
apoptotic signals originating from both the extrinsic
and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Loss of mitochondrial
membrane potential (∆ψm) is associated with the activation
of caspases and the initiation of apoptotic cascades. In
this study, experiments were conducted to examine the
status of mitochondria in DSeA- and/or TRAIL-treated
A375 cells by ﬂow cytometric analysis and ﬂuorescent
microscope examination using JC-1 as a molecular probe
and mito-tracker as a marker of mitochondria. As shown

are representative of three independent experiments with similar results. (C, D) Western blot analysis of the effects of DSeA in combination

in Fig. 3A, DSeA treatment and co-treatment-induced
a marked elevation in depletion of ∆ψm, as determined
by the shift of ﬂuorescence from red to green. The
percentage of depolarized mitochondria increased from
3.8% to 30.1% in cells exposed to 20 µM of DSeA and
40 ng/ml of TRAIL. Furthermore, the results in Fig. 3B
showed that healthy mitochondrial network (0 h) was
extensively interconnected and appeared filamentous
extended throughout the cytoplasm. The treatment of 40
µM DSeA resulted in obvious cytoplasmic shrinkage and
mitochondrial fragmentation, which displayed a rapid
onset after 1 h of treatment, followed by a progressive
increase to 12 h. These evidences further confirmed
the critical role of DSeA in co-treatment-induced the
activation of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis.
Bcl-2 family members have been described as key
regulators of mitochondrial permeability [25]. Therefore,
we examined the effects of DSeA and/or TRAIL on the
expression levels of pro-survival and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2
family proteins in A375 cells. As shown in Fig. 3C and

Fig. 3D, Western blot analysis revealed that co-treatment
significantly suppressed the expression of pro-survival
Bcl-2 family proteins, such as Bcl-2, Mcl-1, and Bcl-xl,
and up-regulated the expression of pro-apoptosis Bcl2 family proteins, such as Bax, Bad, Bim and PUMA.
Moreover, dephosphorylation of Bad at serine 112 was
also observed in response to the combined treatment.
The time course analysis showed that the alternation of
the expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins could be
detected after treated with DSeA for 4 h (Fig. 4B). These
results indicate that the combined treatment causes the
depletion of ∆ψm by regulating the expression of Bcl-2
family proteins.

Activation of p53 pathway by triggering DNA
damage.
To confirm whether p53 signaling pathway is
activated by the combined treatment, we determined

mean ± SD of three independent experiments, *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus the control. (F) Western blot analysis of the inhibitory effects

the protein level of p53 and the related regulators in
A375 cells after treated with indicated concentrations of
DSeA and TRAIL. As shown in Fig. 4A, the treatment
moderately increased the expression of total p53. A
signiﬁcant increase of phosphorylated p53 at serine 15
and phosphorylated ATR at serine 428 were detected
in DSeA and combined treatment. Protein level of
phosphorylated MDM2, a negative regulatory partner of
p53, was also down-regulated in A375 cells treated with
DSeA in combination with TRAIL. Results in Fig. 4B also
showed that pretreatment of cells with 20 µM DSeA for
24 h notably alternated the status of cells, as evidenced
by a rapid onset of ATR and p53 phosphorylation after

1-2 h of treatment, followed by a progressive elevation.
We also showed that, DSeA and TRAIL significantly
up-regulated the phosphorylation of histone H2A.X at
serine 139 (Fig. 4A). The time course analysis revealed
that significant increase in phosphorylated H2A.X was
observed as early as 1 h of DSeA treatment, which was
prior to phosphorylation of p53 (Fig. 4B). Furthermore,
as shown in Fig. 4C, the combined treatment induced a
remarkable DNA damage, as evidenced by the increase in
tail DNA in A375 cells. These results suggest that, DSeA
and TRAIL activate p53 pathway by induction of DNA
damage.
To further examine the role of p53 in cell apoptosis,

different characters (a, b and c) are statistically different at p < 0.05 level. (D) Proposed inhibition of pro-survival PI3K/Akt signaling
pathway triggered by DSeA in A375 cells. Growth factor receptor–ligand interactions recruit and activate PI3K, which modulates PIP3
generation. PIP3 binds to AKT, allowing its translocation to the plasma membrane and then phosphorylated by PDK1 at the sites of Thr308.
The activated Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inactivating several targets, including Bad, Bax, Bim and MDM2. PTEN,
as a major negative regulator (PIP3 inhibitor) in PI3K/Akt pathway, is increased by co-treatment.

we used p53 siRNA to reduce the mRNA expression level
of this gene and examined its effects on cell viability,
caspases activities and the expression of PIGs. As shown in
Fig. 4F, transfection with p53 siRNA significantly downregulated the expression levels of total and phosphorylated
p53 and effectively blocked the co-treatment-induced
cell growth inhibition (Fig. 4D), activation of caspase-3,
caspase-8 and caspase-9 (Fig. 4E, 4F) and PARP cleavage
(Fig. 4F). Results in Fig. 4G showed that the expression
levels of PIGs, including DR5, PUMA and Bax in the
combined treatment were decreased by the transfection,
whereas no obvious change in expression level of TNF-R1
was observed. In addition, the control siRNA showed
no effects on co-treatment-induced p53 activation and
apoptosis. Taken together, these data indicate that the

activation of p53 signaling pathway is required for cotreatment-induced apoptosis.

PI3K/Akt but not MAPKs contributes to cell
apoptosis.
Studies have shown that, upon stress stimuli,
MAPKs phosphorylate and activate p53, leading to p53mediated cellar response [26, 27]. Therefore, in this
study, we examined whether the MAPKs were activated
in DSeA- and/or TRAIL-treated A375 cells by Western
blotting. It was found that co-treatment moderately
increased the expression levels of phosphorylated and total
JNK in A375 cells, but showed no effects on p38 and ERK

(Fig. S1A). Moreover, their specific inhibitors reduced
their phosphorylation levels, but exhibited no obvious
effect on co-treatment-induced cell growth inhibition
(Fig. S1B), demonstrating that co-treatment-induced cell
apoptosis is independent of MAPKs activation.
PI3K/Akt pathway has been found closely related
to chemo-resistance in many tumors [28]. Herein we
showed that, the expression levels of phosphorylated Akt
and PDK1 were slightly up-regulated by TRAIL treatment,
whereas significantly down-regulated by DSeA or cotreatment (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, a moderate increase
in PTEN expression was observed in the combined
treatment. Results in Fig. S2 showed that the expression
levels of PTEN in the combined treatment were decreased
by p53 siRNA transfection. A time course study showed
that Akt and PKD1 phosphorylation increased rapidly
after1 h of DSeA treatment, peaked at approximately 2
h, progressively declined from 8 to 24 h (Fig. 5B), which
could be associated with the enhancement of PTEN
expression. Unexpectedly, an obvious phosphorylation of
PTEN at the site of serine 380 was also observed in DSeAtreated cells (Fig. 5B), which means PTEN, may not be the
critical factor of DSeA-mediated Akt dephosphorylation.
To further confirm our hypothesis, the antiproliferative
activities of co-treatment against a panel of three PTENmutant human cancer cell lines and a PTEN-wild type
cell line were examined by MTT assay. Results in Fig. S3
showed that DSeA synergistically enhanced the anticancer
efficacy of TRAIL in MDA-MB-468 (PTEN-mutant)
cell line, whereas no obvious synergistic effects were
observed in other cell lines. These results demonstrate that
DSeA potentiates TRAIL-induced cell growth inhibition
in a PTEN-independent manner, which means PTEN,
may not be the critical factor of DSeA-mediated Akt
dephosphorylation and cell death in human melanoma
A375 cells.
In addition, PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and
wortmannin were used to evaluate whether suppression
of PI3K/Akt pathway was needed in co-treatment-induced
cell growth inhibition. As shown in Fig. 5C, treatment with
10 µM LY294002, 1 µM Wortmannin or 20 µM DSeA
alone for 24 h showed no signiﬁcant inhibitory effects
on the growth of A375 cells. However, pretreatment with
LY294002 or Wortmannin for 1 h signiﬁcantly increased
the proportion of cell death induced by DSeA or combined
treatment. These results demonstrate that inactivation
of PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was involved in cotreatment-induced cell death in A375 cells.

by Se compounds [29, 30]. Excess ROS is able to
activate a variety of stress responses through activation
or inhibition of distinct kinases [31]. As shown in Fig.
6A and Fig. 6B, DSeA treatments triggered a time- and
dose-dependent increase in DCF and DHE ﬂuorescence
intensity, which indicates that up-regulation of
intracellular ROS and superoxide radicals levels are early
event in DSeA-induced apoptosis. Moreover, pretreatment
of cells with 2.5 mM NAC or GSH completely blocked
DSeA-induced apoptotic cell death in A375 cells, as
reflected by sub-G1 peaks down-regulation, caspase-3
activation and PARP cleavage (Fig. S4). Results in Fig.
6C, D and S5 also showed the significant inhibitory effect
of antioxidants on cell apoptosis. Furthermore, as shown
in Fig. 6E and Fig. 6F, pretreatment with NAC or GSH
effectively inhibited the depletion of ∆ψm though downregulation of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members Bim
and Bax. Results in Fig. 4C and Fig. 6G showed that,
activation of DNA damage-mediated ATR, p53 and H2A.X
phosphoryaltion and phosphorylation of PTEN (Fig. S6)
were also significantly reversed by the pretreatment with
antioxidants. Protein levels of phosphorylated Akt and
its downstream effecter MDM2 were also up-regulated
by NAC and GSH (Fig. 6G), which suggests that ROS
may act as an upstream mediator for PTEN-mediated Akt
inactivation.

DISCUSSION
TRAIL has received a great deal of attention as
novel therapeutic agents due to their high potential
for selective killing activity against transformed cells
[9, 10]. However, over 50% tumor cells, including
malignant melanoma [11], are intrinsically or acquired
resistant to TRAIL treatment alone. Therefore, it is of
great importance to search for agents that could enhance
the sensitivity of cancer cells to TRAIL. In this study,
we showed for the first time that DSeA, as a potential
chemosensitizer, synergistically enhanced the apoptotic
inducing efficacy of TRAIL in A375 cells but not in
normal cells. Results of mechanistic studies indicated that
DSeA significantly potentiates TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in A375 cells by triggering ROS-dependent DNA damage,
p53 phosphorylation and PI3K/Akt signaling pathway
inactivation.
As a result of the balance between therapeutic
potential and toxic side effects of a strategy is very
important when evaluating its usefulness for cancer
treatment, experiments were designed to investigate
the in vitro cytotoxicity of DSeA and/or TRAIL against
human melanoma A375 cell and normal cell lines (HK2, L02). Based on the results obtained from MTT assay

human cells, which suggests that the strategy of DSeA
in combination with TRAIL possesses great selectivity
between cancer and normal cells and displays application
potential in cancer chemoprevention and chemotherapy.
Studies have suggested that many antitumor agents used
in chemotherapy usually cause apoptosis or cell cycle
arrest at the G0/G1 or G2/M phases on cancer cells [32].
Herein, we showed that, exposure of A375 cells to DSeA
and TRAIL resulted in marked accumulation of sub-G1
cell population (Fig. 2A, 2B), DNA fragmentation and
nuclear condensation (Fig. 2C), caspase-3 activation and
PARP cleavage (Fig. 2D, 2E), whereas no significant
changes in cell cycle distribution were observed. These
results indicate that apoptosis is the major mode of cell
death triggered by the combined treatment.
Generally, apoptosis can be initiated by two central
mechanisms, the death receptor mediated-extrinsic
and mitochondrial mediated-intrinsic pathways. In the
present study, we provided convincing evidence that
DSeA significantly enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis
though activation of the extrinsic pathway (Fig. 2F).
Furthermore, the extrinsic pathway was also found to
crosstalk with the intrinsic pathway through the truncation
of Bid, which relayed the apoptotic signal from the cell
surface to mitochondria. Considerable evidence suggests
that selenocompounds potentiated the effect of TRAILinduced apoptosis in cancer cells through activation of

mitochondrial pathway [33, 34]. In this study, treatment
of DSeA alone or in combination with TRAIL resulted in
signiﬁcant depletion of ∆ψm, mitochondrial fragmentation
and release of mitochondrial contents through regulation
of Bcl-2 family members.
Tumor suppressor gene p53 has been reported to be
able to directly or indirectly induce cell apoptosis through
both the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathways [35].
Expression of a host of apoptotic genes is stimulated by
p53, particularly those involved in the mitochondrial
apoptotic pathway such as Bax, NOXA, PUMA and
APAF1. In addition, p53 stimulates expression of genes
involved in the death receptor pathway including DR5,
FAS and PIDD [36]. Herein, our results demonstrated that
p53 was an important regulator in co-treatment-induced
A375 cell apoptosis (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of p53 has
been reported to play a major role in cellular response to
DNA damage, which leads to reduced interaction between
p53 and its negative regulator, oncoprotein MDM2 [37].
Phosphorylation of MDM2 could block its binding to
p19ARF, increasing the degradation of p53 [38]. Thus,
the dephosporylation of MDM2 contributed to the stability
of p53 in A375 cell apoptosis (Fig. 4A). Studies have
reported that DNA damage can activate the p53 pathway
by activating various damage sensor proteins such as ATM,
ATR, DNA-PK, and protein kinases like Chk1 and Chk2
[39]. We have previously showed that, selenocompounds

indues intracellular ROS overproduction in a rapid time. The accumulation of intracellular ROS induces DNA damage-mediated p53
activation and dephosphorlation of Akt, which is negative regulated by PTEN. Inactivation of Akt and phosphorylation of p53 co-regulate
the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins, resulting in depletion of ∆ψm and release of apoptogenic factors from the mitochondria into cytosol.
Furthermore, the activation of p53 increases the expression of death receptors, which accompany with mitochondrial pathway to promote
TRAIL-induced apoptosis through activation of caspase cascade and PARP cleavage.

could induce cancer cell apoptosis though triggering
DNA damage-mediated p53 phosphorylation. [21, 22,
30] Herein we showed that, DNA damage was as an early
cellular event during cell apoptosis, which subsequently
activated the p53 pathway (Fig. 4C). Moreover, silencing
of p53 effectively down-regulated the expression levels of
total p53, Ser 15-p53 and PIGs, and suppressed caspases
activation, which suggest that cell apoptosis induced by
DSeA and TRAIL is p53 dependent.
In addition to triggering a proapoptotic signal
through activation of death receptor pathway, TRAIL
treatment can also activate diverse intracellular signaling
pathways, including NF-κB, PI3K and MAPKs that can
stimulate cell survival and proliferation. Many studies
have reported the regulation of MAPK pathways as
likely mechanisms for induction of apoptosis in cancer
cells by these Se compounds [40, 41]. However, our
results suggested that MAPKs did not play important
roles in regulating the cell apoptosis. The PI3K/Akt
pathway regulates fundamental cellular functions
such as cell growth, survival, and movement [42, 43].
Negative regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is mainly
accomplished by the dual function lipid and protein
phosphatase PTEN, which dephosphorylates the D3
position of PIP2 and PIP3, thereby counteracting
the activity of PI3K [28]. Overexpression of PTEN
uniformly inhibited colony formation, implicating a
tumor-suppressive function of PTEN in melanoma[44].
A number of factors, including p53 have been shown to
transcriptionally regulate PTEN mRNA[45]. In the present
study, DSeA or co-treatment moderately increased the
expression level of PTEN which down-regulated by the
transfection of p53 siRNA. These data suggest that the
dephosphorylation of Akt by DSeA or co-treatment could
be associated with p53-dependent PTEN overexprsssion.
The activated Akt mediates cell growth via the
phosphorylation of many substrates including Bax [46],
Bad [47], MDM2 [48] and FOXO transcription factors,
which can regulate the expression of Bim [49]. For
instance, Akt-mediated phosphorylation of two residues,
ser166 and ser186 in MDM2, has been reported to
stimulate nuclear import of MDM2 and MDM2-mediated
p53 degradation [48]. Under these circumstances, p53
induction becomes acutely sensitive to DNA damageinducing drugs [50]. Accumulative evidences have
showed that several cancer cells were resistant to TRAIL
due to high constitutively active Akt [12, 13, 51].
Downregulation of Akt by the PI3K inhibitors reversed
the TRAIL resistance, while transfecting constitutively
active Akt into cells with low Akt activity attenuated
TRAIL-induced apoptosis [12, 13, 51, 52]. Recent studies
suggest that the regulation of the PI3K/Akt pathways, as
likely mechanisms, were involved in Se compounds alone
or in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs-induced
apoptosis in human cancer cells [22, 41, 53, 54]. In this
study, we have established a mechanistic link between the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PI3K/Akt pathway and cell apoptosis induced by DSeA
and TRAIL. PI3K/Akt pathway plays important roles in
regulating cell death induced by TRAIL, while DSeA
was sufficient to overcome PI3K/Akt pathway-mediated
TRAIL resistance in A375 cells by enhancement of PTEN
expression (Fig. 5).
As a critical upstream initiator in intracellular
signaling cascades, ROS can control cell growth,
proliferation, migration, and apoptosis though regulation
of the activity of certain enzymes [55]. Growing evidence
has suggested that accumulation of ROS acted as an
important cellular event induced by selenocompounds in
cancer cells [21, 29, 30, 56]. In our recent studies, SeC
was identified as a pro-oxidant selenocompound that could
induce cancer cell apoptosis by the activation of oxidative
stress [22]. In this study, we showed that, overproduction
of ROS was involved in cell apoptosis induced by DSeA,
as a Selenocysteine derivative. Excessive production of
ROS could attack various components of DNA, leading
to generation of a variety of ROS-mediated modified
products, including oxidized bases, DNA strand breaks,
DNA intra-strand adducts, and DNA-protein crosslinks
[57]. In this study, as shown in Fig. 4C and Fig. 6,
antioxidants significantly blocked the DNA damage,
p53 activation and depletion of ∆ψm induced by DSeA
and TRAIL. Besides the induction of oxidative damage,
overproduction of ROS was also able to activate PI3K/Akt
signaling pathway, which is the major oxidative stresssensitive signal transduction pathways in most cell types
[31]. Interestingly, we also found that, NAC and GSH
significantly inhibited the combined treatment-induced
dephosphorylation of Akt and its downstream effecter
MDM2 (Fig. 6F). Taken together, ROS acts as an upstream
regulator of Akt and p53 signaling pathways.
In summary, our data provides compelling evidence
that DSeA synergistically enhances the efficacy of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis in A375 cells by triggering
ROS overproduction, which activated DNA damagemediated p53 phosphorylation and suppressed PI3K/
Akt-mediated resistance (Fig. 7). Our results suggest
that the combination of DSeA and TRAIL could be a
novel strategy to overcome PI3K/Akt signaling pathwaymediated resistance in malignant melanoma cells and
DSeA may be candidates for further evaluation as a
chemosensitizer in clinical trails.
