ABSTRACT
Loss of argininosuccinate synthetase (ASS) expression in melanoma makes these
tumor cells vulnerable to arginine deprivation. Pegylated arginine deiminase (ADIPEG20) which degrades arginine to citrulline and ammonia has been used clinically
and partial responses and stable disease have been noted with minimal toxicity. In
order to improve the therapeutic efficacy of ADI-PEG20, we have combined ADI-PEG20
with a DNA damaging agent, cisplatin. We have shown that the combination of the
two drugs together significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy when compared
to ADI-PEG20 alone or cisplatin alone in 4 melanoma cell lines, regardless of their
BRAF mutation. In-vivo study also exhibited the same effect as in-vitro with no added
toxicity to either agent alone. The underlying mechanism is complex, but increased
DNA damage upon arginine deprivation due to decreased DNA repair proteins, FANCD2,
ATM, and CHK1/2 most likely leads to increased apoptosis. This action is further
intensified by increased proapoptotic protein, NOXA, and decreased antiapoptotic
proteins, SURVIVIN, BCL2 and XIAP. The autophagic process which protects cells from
apoptosis upon ADI-PEG20 treatment also dampens upon cisplatin administration.
Thus, the combination of arginine deprivation and cisplatin function in concert to kill
tumor cells which do not express ASS without added toxicity to normal cells.

INTRODUCTION

melanoma patients whose tumors do not express ASS
(ASS(-)) [6]. However, we have found that tumor cells can
undergo autophagy during arginine deprivation as a means
to evade cell death. During this time, certain melanoma
cells can turn on the ASS gene and become resistant to
ADI-PEG20 treatment [5, 9-12]. Therefore, in order to
increase the efficacy of ADI-PEG20, combination with
other agent(s) is needed to evade autophagy and re-direct
the cells toward apoptosis. Consequently, the antitumor
response may be increased. Two well defined pathways
regulate the execution of apoptosis: i) the intrinsic or
mitochondria-initiated pathway and ii) the extrinsic or
receptor-mediated pathway. The intrinsic pathway is

We have previously shown that approximately 70%
of melanoma tumors do not express argininosuccinate
synthetase (ASS) and cannot synthesize arginine from
citrulline. Therefore, arginine becomes an essential amino
acid. Indeed, we and many investigators have shown that
degrading arginine using either arginine deiminase (ADI)
or arginase, both in vivo and in vitro, can lead to tumor
inhibition and cell death [1-5]. Pegylated ADI (ADIPEG20) has been tested in clinical trials and antitumor
activity was seen in melanoma patients [6-8]. Furthermore,
we have shown that the response is seen primarily in

is controlled by members of the BCL2 superfamily.
Previously, we have shown that the addition of TRAIL
leads to an increase in caspase 8 and cleavage of tBID
and increases the apoptotic cell death upon arginine
deprivation. Furthermore, activation of caspase 8 also can
halt the autophagic process by cleavage of key apoptotic
proteins, such as Beclin 1 and ATG5 [13-15]. Since
TRAIL is not an FDA approved drug, we have studied
other agents which can also activate the apoptotic process
via the intrinsic pathway and determined the possible
enhancement effect with ADI-PEG20. We have chosen
cisplatin, one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic
agents in solid tumors, which is known to trigger
apoptosis via the intrinsic pathway[16]. We have found
that combination of both agents increased the apoptosis
without added toxicity. We report the results herein.

for 72 hr. These concentrations are achievable for both
drugs clinically. At 72 hr., viable calls were counted
using trypan blue exclusion test. The growth inhibitory
effect in 4 cell lines and 2 primary cultures were shown
in Fig. 1. Cisplatin at this dosage showed less than 20%
growth inhibition in all cell lines, while ADI-PEG20
alone resulted in 25-40% growth inhibition (Fig. 1).
Combination treatment significantly increased growth
inhibition in all ASS negative cells when compared to
single agent alone (p<0.001). Moreover, we did not
observe significant potentiation effect of ADI-PEG 20
combined with cisplatin in ASS positive cells (A2058R
and Mel-GP). The ID50 of cisplatin was 0.25 μg/ml and
0.3 μg/ml, respectively with or without ADI-PEG20.
Furthermore, ADI-PEG20 at 0.05 μg/ml had no effect
on cell growth for both cell lines. This is expected due
to the fact that these cells can synthesize arginine from
citrulline. Overall, the addition of ADI-PEG20 increases
the growth inhibitory effect of cisplatin in ASS(-) cells
which indicates that arginine deprivation is an important
factor responsible for this effect.

Cells were treated with ADI-PEG20 (0.05µg/ml)
alone or cisplatin (0.1µg/ml) alone or in combination

for 72hr. The untreated control was set at 100%. ADI-PEG20 alone results in approximately 60-77% viable cells depending on the cell
lines and is statistically significant compared to control (P<0.05). Cisplatin at 0.1µg/ml results in 80-90% viable cells or less than 20%
growth inhibition. Combination of ADI-PEG20+cisplatin results in 35-60% viable cells. Compared to ADI-PEG 20 alone, it is statistically
significant (P < 0.001). The growth inhibitory effect was an average of three separate experiments with each experiment performed in
duplicate.

) cell lines, using the student t-test (p-values range from
less than 0.005 to 0.05). This was not observed in ASS(+)
Mel-GP cells. Fig. S1b showed that there was no change
for cisplatin treatment alone vs. combination in Mel-GP
(29.3% vs.27.8%, respectively). To determine that the
apoptosis was caspase mediated, we have assayed caspase
3 and 9 by Western blot. The data were shown in Fig. 2B.
All 4 ASS (-) cell lines exhibited an increase in cleaved
caspase 9 and caspase 3 when cells were exposed to both
drugs. In Mel1220, the increase in cleaved caspase 9 and 3
was not well visualized when treated with cisplatin alone;
however, it was well visualized with the combination. To
further confirm that apoptosis was mediated by caspase,
we have co-treated A2058 cells with pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK and this was able to reverse the apoptotic
process (see Fig. S2). Thus, our data strongly indicate
that the addition of ADI-PEG20 significantly increased
the antitumor effect of cisplatin in ASS (-) melanoma cell
lines, but not in ASS (+) cells.

We then investigated whether this combination
also results in increased apoptotic cell death. Four ASS(-)
cell lines (A375, Mel1220, A2058 and Sk-Mel2) and one
ASS(+) cell line (Mel-GP) were used for this study. Cells
were treated with ADI-PEG20 at 0.1µg/ml or cisplatin
at 1µg/ml or both for 72 hr. The higher concentration of
ADI-PEG20 was used in order to deplete arginine more
rapidly and hence cells would be exposed to arginine-free
environment for a longer period of time which enabled us
to detect early apoptosis. Nevertheless, the concentration
for both ADI-PEG20 and cisplatin are achievable clinically
[16]. At 72 hr, apoptotic assay was performed using
Annexin-V and PI. The results were shown in Fig. 2A and
Fig. S1a. Combination treatment resulted in a significant
increase in apoptotic cell death compared to either
cisplatin alone or with ADI-PEG20 alone in all 4 ASS(-

Augmentation of antitumor effect of ADI-PEG 20

Mechanism of increased antitumor effect of
cisplatin by ADI-PEG20

Mice were given ADI-PEG20 IM alone or cisplatin
IP alone or in combination as stated in the method section.
The results of the tumor growth curves and tumor sizes
at different time points after initiation of therapy were
shown in Fig. 3. The mean tumor size of saline treated
control mice reached 1381 mm3 at 27 days after treatment.
Treatment with ADI-PEG20 alone (53.3IU/kg, q6d x 4)
delayed tumor growth by 7 days at 400 mm3 size, and
produced a mean tumor size of 640 mm3 size at day 27
(T/C value = 46%, p < 0.001) compared with control
group. Treatment with cisplatin alone (6mg/kg, q6d x 3)
delayed tumor growth by 12 days at 400 mm3 size, and
produced a mean tumor size of 400 mm3 on day 27 (T/C
value = 29%, p < 0.001) compared with control group.
Compared with the treatment of ADI-PEG20 alone or
cisplatin alone, the combination of the two drugs further
delayed the tumor growth by day 27, with a mean tumor
size of 83 mm3 (T/C value = 6% p < 0.001 compared to
ADI-PEG20 and p<0.005 compared to cisplatin alone),
respectively. Thus, both our in-vitro and in-vivo data
strongly indicated that the combination of cisplatin
and ADI-PEG20 significantly reduced the tumor size
compared with either agent alone. The toxicity in mice
was not increased and there were no deaths from the
treatment. Although temporary body weight loss (10%)
occurred immediately after each treatment, the body
weight recovered to normal before each treatment.

Enhanced DNA damage and decreased DNA repair
protein are seen in melanoma cells treated with cisplatin
and ADI-PEG20. It is known that cisplatin treatment
results in DNA damage which causes cell cycle arrest and
eventually cell death. In order for cells to survive, DNA
repair must occur [17, 18]. We hypothesize that arginine
deprivation will impair the repair process and hence
increase DNA damage which drives the cells toward
apoptosis. We have treated all 4 cell lines with cisplatin
alone in normal media or in ADI-PEG20 treated media
for 48 hr. The extent of DNA damage was assessed by
examining the foci of γH2AX, a marker for double
strand DNA break [19]. Treatment with cisplatin showed
an increase in γH2AX compared to control (p<0.05 for
A375 and Sk-Mel-2 and p<0.01 for A2058 and Mel1220).
ADI-PEG20 treatment showed no significant change
compared to control. However, with ADI-PEG20 and
cisplatin, all 4 cell lines showed a statistical increase in
γH2AX when compared to cisplatin in normal media
(p<0.01 for A375, p<0.005 for A2058,and p<0.05 for
both Mel1220 and Sk-Mel2) (Fig. 4A). Thus, our results
suggested that the addition of ADI-PEG20 to deplete the
arginine in the media with cisplatin results in an increase
in DNA damage, most likely secondary to impairment of
DNA repair. To elucidate which proteins were involved,
we have performed cDNA Microarray after cells were
treated with ADI-PEG20 for three days in three cell lines,
A2058, A375, and Mel1220. We have found that FANCD2
(accession NM_033084) was consistently lower in all
three cell lines after ADI-PEG20 treatment, while FANCL

volume was measured prior to treatment as stated in the Methods section. Compared to vehicle control, all three treatment groups showed
statistically better results than control group (p<0.001). Compared with ADI-PEG20 alone, combination treatment is highly statistically
superior to ADI-PEG20 with p<0.001. Combination also showed highly statistically better results than cisplatin alone with p<0.005. Table

(accession NM_018062) showed less than 2 fold decrease
in all cell lines(data not shown). There were no changes in
ATR, ERCC family and BRCA family, RAD50, RAD51
and RPA. It is known that both ATM and FANCD are
important proteins to initiate repair of DNA double strand
breaks. Thus, a decrease of these two proteins can lead
to impairment of DNA repair process. To confirm this,
we have performed immunoblot of ATM, FANCD2, and
FANCL in 4 cells lines after treatment with ADI-PEG20
alone, cisplatin alone, and in combination. The results
were shown in Fig. 4B. ATM and Phospho-ATM were
consistently lower in 4 cell lines after treatment with ADIPEG20 alone when compared to control, and increased
after exposure to cisplatin in response to DNA damage
and decreased again upon combination treatment (Fig.
4B). Phosphor-Check2 (CHK2), a cell cycle checkpoint

regulator known to be phosphorylated by ATM also
decreased after ADI-PEG20 treatment, increased after
cisplatin treatment and again decrease after combination.
It is known that Fanconi anemia (FA) family is essential
for repairing DNA crosslinks [17, 20]. Monoubiquitination
of FANCD2 is essential for orchestrating the whole DNA
repair process which involves many family members
of FA including FANCL [21-23]. Decreased FANCD2
was seen with ADI-PEG20 alone, and increased after
cisplatin treatment in response to DNA damage. This
protein also decreased after combination treatment.
Overall, arginine deprivation alone resulted in a decrease
in multiple DNA repair proteins, but did not cause DNA
damage. On the other hand, cisplatin treatment alone
resulted in DNA damage which triggered an increase in
DNA repair proteins. Importantly, with the combination,

foci after treatment with cisplatin at 0.5 µg/ml for 48 hr in normal media and in ADI-PEG20 treated media. The γH2AX foci increased in all
4 cell lines with cisplatin alone (p≤0.05 in A375 and SkMel2, p≤0.01 in A2058 and Mel1220) which was expected since cisplatin is known
to cause DNA damage. Upon arginine deprivation alone, there were no changes in γH2AX foci compared to control; however, the γH2AX
foci increased significantly on combination treatment in all 4 cell lines, which indicates that in the absence of arginine, cisplatin treatment
results in more damage (p<0.01 in A-375, p<0.005 in A-2058, p<0.05 in Mel-1220 and Sk-Mel2). (B) Illustrates that increase in DNA
damage is secondary to decrease in DNA repair process. Ubiquitinated FANCD, p-ATM, ATM, and p-CHK2, which increased in response
to cisplatin treatment to initiate the repair process, showed a decrease upon combination treatment. The amount of FANCL also slightly
decreased upon combination treatment in 3 cell lines. A375 possess very low amounts of FANCL and so differences could not be visualized.

Interference with apoptotic and anti-apoptotic
proteins by ADI-PEG20 enhances the antitumor
effect to cisplatin

the lower levels of DNA repair proteins produced by
arginine deprivation still persisted and was not completely
negated by the induction of DNA repair proteins caused
by cisplatin treatment. Thus, the net result still showed
lower DNA repair proteins and hence an increase in DNA
damage as illustrated by an increase in γH2AX foci.
In contrast, for A2058R cell line which express ASS,
treatment with ADI-PEG20 alone did not have any effect
in FANCD2 and phosphor-ATM and hence there were
no changes in these proteins upon combination treatment
when compared to cisplatin alone (Fig. S3). As a result,
there were no change in the growth inhibitory or apoptotic
effect

Another factor which can contribute to the demise
of melanoma cells is the alteration in the pro- and antiapoptotic proteins which favors apoptosis. We have
previously shown that an increase in proapoptotic
protein and decrease in antiapoptotic protein occurs upon
arginine deprivation [13, 14]. However, the signal is not
sufficiently intense to drive the cells toward apoptosis
and instead the cells undergo autophagy as the mean for
survival [9]. In contrast, exposure to cisplatin results in
upregulation of antiapoptotic protein to evade apoptotic
cell death from DNA damage [16, 24, 25]. We hypothesize
that combination treatment with ADI-PEG20 and cisplatin
results in the inability of cells to up-regulate antiapoptotic

at 0.1µg/ml or cisplatin 0.5µg/ml or both for 72 hr. then lysed and immunoblotted with pro-and anti apoptotic protein. Treatment with ADIPEG20 results in increase in NOXA in all 4 cells while treatment with cisplatin results in a decrease in NOXA. The increase in NOXA
persist upon combination treatment with (see supplement for quantification). There was no change in BCL2 after ADI-PEG20 treatment,
but BCL2 increased after cisplatin treatment and decreased after combination treatment. XIAP decreased after ADI-PEG20 treatment
in A375, increased after cisplatin and again decreased after combination. SURVIVIN decreased in all 4 cell lines after ADI-PEG20 and
increased after cisplatin treatment and again decreased upon combination treatment. Actin was used as control. (B) Immunoprecipitate
using MCL1 in A2058 after cisplatin treatment alone, ADI-PEG20 alone and in combination treatment. More NOXA binding to MCL1 was seen after ADI-PEG20 treatment while increased BAK binding to MCL1 was seen after cisplatin treatment. Upon combination
treatment, increased NOXA binding to MCL-1 occurred and much less BAK was bound to MCL1(Black arrow head). This unbound BAK
was able to induce MOMP. (C) Silencing SURVIVIN in A375 and A2058 cell lines resulted in >90% decrease in SURVIVIN, both mRNA
(data not shown) and protein levels. There was no effect in MCL1 (control) and actin was used as internal control. Silencing SURVIVIN
resulted in significantly increased sensitivity to cisplatin alone, and in combination for both cell lines (P<0.001).

proteins and hence lead to an increase in cell death. In
this context, we have examined NOXA, MCL1, BCL2,
XIAP, and SURVIVIN in 4 cell lines upon exposure to
ADI-PEG20 alone, cisplatin alone and in combination.
The pro and antiapoptotic proteins were chosen from our
previous publications [13, 14] and cDNA microarray data.
The proteins were assayed by immunoblot. The results
were shown in Fig. 5A.
Treatment with ADI-PEG20 alone showed no
significant change in BCL2, while cisplatin alone showed
a slight increase in 3 cell lines (A2058, Mel1220 and
Sk-Mel2)(Fig 5A). A375 does not express BCL2. The
combination showed a decrease in all 3 cell lines (A2058,
Mel1220 and Sk-Mel2). Similar to BCL2, treatment with

cisplatin also led to an increase in XIAP in A375 and SkMel2 while combination treatment showed lower levels.
However, there was no significant change in MCL1. It is
known that NOXA (proapoptotic protein) can bind MCL1
and interfere with its antiapoptotic function [26, 27]. Our
previous results as well as current results indicated that
NOXA was increased in all 4 cell lines after treatment
with ADI-PEG 20 (see Fig. S4 for band quantification). In
contrast, exposure to cisplatin resulted in down regulation
of NOXA while the combination increased NOXA (Fig.
5A and Fig. S4). Thus, it is possible that elevated NOXA
levels upon arginine deprivation counter balance the
decrease in NOXA seen upon cisplatin treatment. Since
NOXA can bind MCL1, and MCL1 is known to binds

and its cleaved form after treatment with ADI-PEG20 alone, cisplatin alone, and in combination. Treatment with cisplatin alone resulted
in slight cleavage of Beclin 1 while the combination resulted in higher increased in cleaved Beclin1. (B)Treatment with ADI-PEG20

BAK and prevent BAK to initiate the apoptosis, higher
NOXA levels can displace BAK from binding MCL1
and hence more free BAK is available to initiate the
apoptotic process. To determine this, we have performed
immunoprecipitation with MCL1 and then detected the
immunoprecipitate with NOXA and BAK. The results
were shown in Fig. 5B. NOXA was associated with
MCL1 after ADI-PEG20 treatment. The increase of
NOXA association with MCL1 is due to the increased
NOXA protein after ADI-PEG20 treatment as could be
seen from the input. Cisplatin treatment alone decreased
NOXA protein with subsequent less binding to MCL1.
However, with the combination treatment, this trend was
reversed by ADI-PEG20. The amount of NOXA bound to
MCL1 was comparable to that after ADI-PEG20 treatment
alone. Thus, with more NOXA bound to MCL1, there was
less BAK associated with MCL1 (Fig. 5B, black arrow
head). This is consistent with earlier reports that NOXA
can displace the interaction of BAK with MCL1, thus
freeing the BAK for initiation of apoptosis via increased
mitochondria outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP).
Although cisplatin alone increased the expression of BAK,
the binding of BAK to MCL1 also increased and hence
was unable to disrupt the mitochondrial outer membrane.
Overall, ADI-PEG20 combined with cisplatin effectively
reduced the amount of BAK bound to MCL1 due to an
increase in NOXA binding to MCL1, and hence more free
BAK was available to initiate the apoptotic process.
Treatment with ADI-PEG20 alone also showed
down regulation of SURVIVIN. Upregulation of
SURVIVIN has been shown in melanoma tumor samples
and is one of the contributory factors to drug resistance
[28]. Fig. 5A and Fig. S4 showed that treatment with
cisplatin increased SURVIVIN, while combination
showed an overall decrease. In order to further delineate
the role of SURVIVIN with this combination treatment,
we have knock down SURVIVIN using siRNA and
examined the growth inhibitory effect of ADI-PEG20
alone, cisplatin alone and in combination. The results
were shown in Fig. 5C. Silencing SURVIVIN showed a
significant increase in antitumor effect with cisplatin alone
and with the combination of cisplatin + ADI-PEG20 in
both cell lines (p< 0.001). Importantly, comparing the
growth inhibitory effect of cisplatin + ADI-PEG20 with
cisplatin + knock down of SURVIVIN, the combination
treatment of cisplatin + ADI-PEG20 had slightly better
effect (35% VS 48%, respectively, in A375) than silencing
SURVIVIN alone. This is expected since treatment with
ADI-PEG20 can decrease other antiapoptotic proteins
besides SURVIVIN. On the other hand, in A2058 cell
line, there was no change in growth inhibitory effect
between the silencing SURVIVIN with cisplatin versus
ADI-PEG20 with cisplatin. It is possible that in A2058
cell line, SURVIVIN plays a major antiapoptotic role upon
exposure to cisplatin. In addition, the level of SURVIVIN
was much lower in the silencing condition than when
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the cells were treated with ADI-PEG20 alone. These
two factors could explain the better therapeutic effect on
silencing SURVIVIN compared to combination treatment.
Overall, we can conclude that a decrease in antiapoptotic
proteins and an increase in proapoptotic proteins by
arginine deprivation contributes to the potentiation effect
of ADI-PEG 20 and cisplatin seen in ASS(-) melanoma
cell lines.
Taking together all the above data, the augmentation
of the cytotoxic effect of cisplatin by ADI-PEG20 involves
multiple mechanisms. Increased DNA damage secondary
to decrease in DNA repair process triggers the stronger
apoptotic signal, which is further enhanced by a decrease
in antiapoptotic proteins and an increase in pro-apoptotic
proteins. Hence, this drives the cells toward the apoptotic
pathway (see Diagram1). In addition, treatment with
cisplatin also activates caspase cascade and cleavage of
Beclin1 (Fig. 6A). This halts the autophagic process, a
pro-survival mechanism upon ADI-PEG20 treatment
due to arginine deprivation [9]. To further confirm this,
we have assayed autophagy using the Cyto-ID autophagy
detection kit from Enzo Life Science, as illustrated in
Fig. 6B. ADI-PEG20 treatment alone showed multiple
autophagic vacuoles which diminish upon combination
treatment with cisplatin. Thus, by abrogating the survival
mechanism upon arginine deprivation with ADI-PEG-20
treatment using cisplatin, one can re-direct the cells toward
apoptosis. Overall, by combining arginine deprivation
using ADI-PEG20 which is specific for ASS(-) melanoma
tumor cells with cisplatin, one can significantly enhance
the antitumor effect without an increase in toxicity as seen
with other combination therapies.

DISCUSSION
Substantial progress has been made for the treatment
of malignant melanoma in the past two years. This
includes the discovery of BRAF inhibitors (vemurafenib
and dabrafenib) and MEK inhibitor (trametinab). This
BRAF/MEK treatment is effective in tumors which carry
the BRAF mutation. On the other hand, resistance is
inevitable and side effects which include a high incidence
of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma [29-32] can occur.
Another class of agents such as ipilimumab offers durable
response with a response rate of 25% [33, 34]. However,
treatment also results in significant side effects including
colitis. We and others have found that certain melanomas
do not express ASS, a key enzyme in the urea cycle for
synthesizing arginine. Thus, arginine becomes an essential
amino acid in this setting. This has led to the development
of pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20) which
degrades arginine to citrulline and ammonia. Melanomas
which lack ASS (ASS(-)) cannot synthesize arginine
from citrulline and hence arginine deprivation therapy in
these tumors results in growth inhibition and prolonged
starvation leading to apoptosis. Besides ADI-PEG20,
6302

arginase, an enzyme present in human cells which
degrades arginine to ornithine and urea, also has been
shown to be active in ASS(-) tumors including melanoma
[35, 36]. However, ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) is
needed to convert ornithine to citrulline. Thus, normal
cells which lack OTC can become toxic while tumor
cells which lack both ASS and OTC are more sensitive
[36]. Nevertheless, its pegylated and modified form to
improve activity and pharmacokinetic profile has been
synthesized [37, 38] in preparation for clinical trial.
Another factor which influences the response to arginine
deprivation is autophagy which enables melanoma cells
to survive and hence combination treatment is needed
to enhance the apoptotic signal. In fact, we have found
that combination of TRAIL with ADI-PEG20 leads to an
increase in apoptosis. However, TRAIL is not clinically
available. In this laboratory investigation, we used a
combination ADI-PEG20 with cisplatin, a commonly
used chemotherapeutic agent which shows antitumor
activity against a wide variety of solid tumors. We
have found that the combination of ADI-PEG20 with
cisplatin significantly enhances the antitumor effect in
all ASS negative melanoma cell lines. This enhanced
effect was also demonstrated in vivo with mice and the

combination was well tolerated with no added toxicity
compared to cisplatin alone. This combination has moved
to the clinic and is currently in phase I- II trial at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT01665183).
It is known that cisplatin treatment results in DNA
crosslinking and possible translesional synthesis [17]. We
have found that treatment with ADI-PEG20 in ASS(-) cells
leads to a decrease in FANCD, an important DNA repair
protein for cisplatin. FANCD2 belongs to the Fanconi
Anemia family which has at least 15 family members
[39]. DNA damage stimulates monoubiquitinylation
of FANCD2 by the FA core complex, a multi-subunit
E3 ubiquitin ligase [40]. Subsequently, this leads to
DNA double breaks and activation of ATM which is
also decreased upon arginine deprivation. This process
is required for cells to survive cisplatin insult [41].
The key question is why arginine deprivation leads to
decreased FANCD2. Recently, it has been shown that
mTOR1-S6K1 signaling controls the transcription of
FANCD2 [42, 43]. In this regard, we have previously
shown that arginine deprivation by ADI-PEG20 leads
to inhibition of mTOR [5] while cisplatin treatment can
result in mTOR activation [9, 44]in an attempt to evade

cell death. Thus, it is possible that inhibition of mTOR
by arginine deprivation is a possible mechanism(s) why
FANCD2 is decreased. To support this notion, we have
assayed phosphor-p70S6K and phosphor 4E-BP, the
two proteins known to be phosphorylated by mTOR. As
shown in Fig.S5, arginine deprivation does lead to lesser
4E-BP and p70S6 kinase phosphorylation while cisplatin
increases them and the combination treatment leads to
lesser mTOR activation (less 4EBP phosphorylation and
phosphorylation of p70S6K) when compared to cisplatin
Thus, our data suggest that lower FANCD2 is most likely
mediated via mTOR pathway, as previously reported by
others.
The other mechanism which contributes to the
potentiation of this combination is the alteration in the
pro- and antiapoptotic proteins from arginine deprivation.
Our data indicate that treatment with cisplatin can result
in upregulation of antiapoptotic proteins in an attempt for
the cell to evade apoptosis [45]. This effect is negated
by increasing pro-apoptotic protein such as NOXA
upon arginine deprivation. On the other hand, arginine
deprivation leads to autophagy as its survival mechanism
which was terminated by activation of caspase cascade
by cisplatin which can cleave Beclin 1 and terminate the
autophagic process.
Another possible mechanism of this elevated
cytotoxic effect of cisplatin and ADI-PEG20 is mediated
via nitric oxide (NO). It is known that arginine is the
major substrate of NO. Thus, arginine deprivation
undoubtedly leads to a decrease in NO (Fig.S6). This
finding also has been previously reported in tissue
culture, animals and humans with either melanoma or
hepatocellular carcinoma [7, 46-48]. Depletion of NO can
inhibit melanoma proliferation, and enhance cisplatininduced apoptosis in melanoma cells in tissue culture
[49, 50]. In addition, NO inhibition with the selective
antagonist N6-(1-iminoethyl)–L-lysine dihydrochloride
(L-NIL) synergized with cisplatin in xenograft models
without added toxicity [50]. Interestingly, although the
mice only received 3 doses of cisplatin every 3 days,
continued dosing of L-NIL was sufficient to suppress
tumor growth [50]. Also, endogenously produced NO
mitigates sensitivity of melanoma cells to cisplatin [51].
Similarly, acquired resistance to cisplatin in lung cancer
cells has been shown to be mediated by NO, and NOmediated drug resistance was found to be reversible when
cells were further cultured in the absence of NO [52].
Thus, it is possible that depletion of NO contributes to
the increased sensitivity to cisplatin. On the other hand,
NO is also known to have both cytostatic and cytocidal
effects against tumor cells, and nitric oxide donor has
been shown to sensitize tumor cells to radiation [53].
P53 status also plays a key factor to the dichotomy effect
of NO [53]. Overall, the paradoxical effect of NO most
likely depends on the tumor microenvironment, immune
system, oncogene and tumor suppressor genes. Whether
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

sensitization of cisplatin by ADI-PEG20 in melanoma
cells is partly mediated by NO is not proven at this time
and may depend on molecular genetic alteration of each
cell line and tumor microenvironment.
In summary, we have found an effective
combination to treat malignant melanomas which do not
express ASS, regardless of their BRAF mutation status.
Since ADI-PEG20 is well tolerated, this combination of
ADI-PEG20 with cisplatin which drive the cells toward
apoptosis, is feasible. Other combinations such as with
temozolomide and taxotere also have been examined;
however, the enhancement effect is not as significant as
with cisplatin in melanoma [54]. In this study, we have
clearly shown that combination of cisplatin with ADIPEG20 is superior to either treatment alone and does not
produce overt toxicity in vivo. The mechanism(s) involved
is complex and appears to involve multiple mechanisms.
All these mechanisms complement each other and drives
the ASS(-) cell toward apoptosis. Importantly, it does not
result in an increase in toxicity in normal cells, due to
the fact that normal cells possess ASS expression. This
combination of ADI-PEG20 with cisplatin is currently in
clinical trial. The mechanism(s) of potentiation identified
here will be studied in tumor samples from this trial.

METHODS
Cell lines
Four ASS (-) melanoma cell lines (A375, Sk-Mel2,
A2058 and Mel1220) were used for this study. A375,
Sk-Mel2, A2058 were obtained from ATCC without
further authentication. All cell lines showed undetectable
mycoplasma contamination using routine MycoAlert
detection kit (Lonza). Mel1220 was established from
a subcutaneous nodule of a patient and has been
characterized (9). A375, A2058 and Mel1220 possess
BRAFV600E mutation and Sk-Mel2 has N-RAS mutation.
A2058 has inducible ASS when treated with ADI-PEG 20
or arginine free media [5]. All cell lines were maintained
on EMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS. Mel-114
and Mel-F are primary cultures generated from patients
[6]. Mel-F is positive for BRAF mutation while Mel114 is BRAF wild type. Both primary cultures do not
express ASS. A-2058R is a resistant variant of A2058
which express ASS [55]. Mel-GP is a melanoma cell line
derived from a patient whose tumor express ASS and did
not respond to ADI-PEG20 [6]. These two cell lines were
used as negative control. They were also maintained on
EMEM. Mel-1220 and Mel-GP express MITF, Melan-A,
and tyrosinase.

Reagents

(Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:1000 dilutions. The cell pellet
was resuspended with 1X lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology) plus 1:1000 dilutions of protease and
phosphatase inhibitors (same as above) and sonicated
briefly on ice. The total protein concentration of the lysate
was determined with the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit
from Pierce. The prepared lysate then was mixed with
SDS-PAGE sample buffer and heated at 100°C for 10
min. The processed lysate was loaded to SDS-PAGE gel,
transferred onto nylon membrane and immunoblotted
with various antibodies overnight. This membrane was
then blocked with 5% milk (Bio-Rad) in TBS buffer.
After incubation with primary antibody and horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, the target
protein bands were visualized with SuperSignal West
Femto (Thermo-Fisher). The image of bands was captured
with a Bio-Rad ChemDoc system. ImageJ was used to
estimate the molecular weight, and Quantity One (BioRad) was used to measure the optical density of protein
bands detected by western blot.

ADI-PEG 20 was supplied by Polaris
Pharmaceuticals Inc. Cisplatin was purchased from
clinical pharmacy service. NOXA, MCL1, BCL2, XIAP
and SURVIVIN were purchased from Cell Signaling.
FANCD2 and FANCL were purchased from Sigma. ADIPEG20 treated media was prepared by adding ADI-PEG20
at 0.05µg/ml (specific activity 63.5 IU/ml) to EMEM
media and incubated for 48 hr. At this concentration there
is no detectable arginine in the media while citrulline is
>300 µg/ml as detected by HPLC [11].

Growth inhibitory assay
5x104 cells were seeded in 24 wells plated for 8 hr
to allow attachment. Cells were treated with ADI-PEG20
at 0.05ug/ml alone, or with cisplatin(0.1µg/ml) alone,
or in combination. At 72 hr. viable cells were counted
using trypan blue exclusion. The percentage of viable
cells in each dosage was calculated with the control set
at 100%. This concentration of ADI-PEG20 was chosen
from our previous publication which showed that ADIPEG20 at 0.05µg/ml is capable of degrading the arginine
in EMEM media in 24 -36 hr. and no detectable arginine
level is found at 72 hr. in all cell lines tested. At 0.1 µg/
ml of ADI-PEG20, there is no detectable arginine level
in media overnight [11]. This treatment mimics what we
observed clinically. However, in cell lines which required
RPMI media or DMEM, the concentration of ADI-PEG20
will be higher since they have higher arginine content in
the media.

Immunofluorescence detection for γH2AX
Cells were seeded onto coverslip in 24-well plate
and were treated with cisplatin 0.5 µg/ml in normal media
for 48 hr. or in ADI-PEG20 (0.1ug/ml) treated media
for 48 hr. The control group consisted of cells grown
in normal media and ADI-PEG20 treated media.The
coverslip was removed, fixed in methanol, then incubated
in 1%BSA / 10% normal goat serum / 0.3M glycine in
0.1% PBS-Tween for 1h to permeabilize the cells and
block non-specific protein-protein interactions. The cells
were then incubated with the γH2AX antibody (ab22551),
10µg/ml and detection was performed using Alexa fluoro
488
Immunoprecipitation Total cell lysate was prepared
as above. The cell lysate of all samples were pre-cleaned
with isotype antibody (IgG) and gammaBind bead. This
process removes nonspecific protein binding to the
antibody or to the bead. Following pre-clean process,
the specific antibody (anti-Mcl1) and beads were used
to bring down Mcl-1 and its interacting protein and then
immunoblot with BAK and NOXA.

Apoptotic assay
Annexin-V-Fluos Staining Kit from Roche Applied
Science or the Annexin V:FITC Assay Kit (AbD SeroTec)
was used to label cells which have been treated with drugs.
Briefly, the adherent cells (1.8x105 cells/well seeded
overnight) were treated in a 12-well plate. The medium
was collected; cells were washed once with DPBS. The
wash was combined with the collected medium. The cells
were dissociated with 0.25% Typsin/EDTA (Invitrogen)
and combined with the collected medium and DPBS.
After centrifugation and removal of the supernatant, the
cells were washed once with DPBS. Then the cells were
processed according to the instruction of the staining kit.
The data were collected in an Accuri C6 flow cytometer
and analyzed with its bundled CFlow Plus software.

Knocking down of SURVIVIN
ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool siRNA targeting
human SURVIVIN was purchased from Thermo
Scientific. These RNAi molecules are designed
to target 4 different regions of SURVIVIN (target
sequences:
5′-CAAAGGAAACCAACAAUAA-3′,
5′-GCAAAGGAAACCAACAAUA-3′,
5′-CACCGCAUCUCUACAUUCA-3′,
5′-CCACUGAGAACGAGCCAGA-3′). Transfection of

recommended protocol. At 24 hr post transfection, the
transfected cells were seeded onto 24-well plate. ADIPEG20 or cisplatin alone or combination was added, at
the end of 72 hr. Viable cells were counted using trypan
blue exclusion.

Detection kit purchased from Enzo Life Science per
manufacture protocol. This green autophagic dye has been
shown to be specific for autophagy and co-localized with
LC3 .

Statistical analysis

Xenograft studies

Data in bar graphs were represented as mean ±
SD. Student’s t-test was used to compare the two sets
of data. ANOVA was used to compare three or more set
of data. The standard deviation represents three separate
experiments. For growth inhibitory and apoptotic assay,
each experiment was done in duplicate. Statistical
significance was defined as p<0.05 (*) and statistical high
significance was defined as p≤0.01.

5x106 of A375 cells was inoculated subcutaneously
at the flank of 6 weeks old female Balb/C nude mice. Eight
days post inoculation when the tumor size reached about
100 mm3,, treatment was started. Mice were separated
into four groups (6 mice per each group). The first group
(control group) was given saline (10µl/kg). Second group
received ADI-PEG 20 53.3 IU/kg IM every 6 days per
week for 4 doses. The third group received cisplatin 6 mg/
kg I.P once every 6 days for 3 doses and the fourth group
received combination treatment. Mice were monitored
for body weight, behavior such as mobility, water
consumption, eye / hair matting. Tumor size was measured
twice weekly using a caliper. The volume was expressed
using the formula V=0.5 a x b2 where a and b are the short
and long diameter respectively. T/C is calculated with T as
the median time (in days) required for the treatment group
tumor to reach a pre-determined size and C is the median
for the control to reach the same size. The T/C value (in
percent) is an indication of antitumor effectiveness.

Briefly, cells seeded in 6-well plates were collected
in 0.5 mL of Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) after ADI-PEG20
treatment for 72hrs and total RNA was isolated. Total RNA
was quantified with a Nanodrop 8000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Scientific) and its quality was examined with a
Bioanalyzer 2100 using the RNA 6000 Nano kit (Agilent).
Biotinylated cRNA was prepared using the Illumina
TotalPrep RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions starting with 400 ng total
RNA. Successful cRNA generation was checked using the
Bioanalyzer 2100. Samples were added to the Beadchip
after randomization using the randomized block design to
reduce batch effects. Hybridization to the Sentrix Human-6
Version 2 Expression BeadChip (Illumina), washing and
scanning were performed according to the Illumina bead
Station 500 manual (Revision C). The resulting microarray
data was analyzed using Illumina Bead Studio software.
