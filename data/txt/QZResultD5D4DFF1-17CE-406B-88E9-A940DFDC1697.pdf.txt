Abstract

Author Manuscript

Most p53 mutations in human cancers are missense mutations resulting in a full-length mutant p53
protein. Besides losing tumor suppressor activity, some hotspot p53 mutants gain oncogenic
functions. This effect is mediated in part, through gene expression changes due to inhibition of
p63 and p73 by mutant p53 at their target gene promoters. Here, we report that the tumor
suppressor microRNA let-7i is downregulated by mutant p53 in multiple cell lines expressing
endogenous mutant p53. In breast cancer patients, significantly decreased let-7i levels were
associated with missense mutations in p53. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and promoter
luciferase assays established let-7i as a transcriptional target of mutant p53 through p63.
Introduction of let-7i to mutant p53 cells significantly inhibited migration, invasion and metastasis
by repressing a network of oncogenes including E2F5, LIN28B, MYC and NRAS. Our findings
demonstrate that repression of let-7i expression by mutant p53 has a key role in enhancing
migration, invasion and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

The p53 tumor suppressor is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of hundreds
of genes1 and inhibits neoplastic transformation by inducing cell cycle arrest, senescence
and apoptosis.2,3 The TP53 gene is frequently (>50%) mutated in human cancers through
missense mutations that result in the expression of a full-length mutant p53 protein that
accumulates at high levels in cancer cells. Most missense mutations in the TP53 gene occur
in the DNA-binding domain of p53, and among these are six ‘hotspot’ mutations at residues
R175, G245, R248, R249, R273 and R282 that occur at a markedly high frequency.4 These
diverse mutations result in a p53 protein with weakened or abrogated transactivation
function resulting in loss of tumor suppressor activity. However, it is becoming increasingly
clear that several p53 mutants, including the hotspot mutants R175H and R273H often
acquire novel oncogenic functions and promote invasion and metastasis when introduced
into p53-null cells, suggesting gain-of-function activities of mutant p53.5-9
Mutant p53 exerts its gain of function, in part, through interactions with several proteins
including PIN1 and TOPBP1.10,11 Although mutant p53 proteins, in general, exhibit
diminished DNA-binding activity, they can drive gene expression by binding to other
transcription factors including NF-Y, VDR, E2F1, ETS2 and the p53 family members p63
and p73.12-15 Among these, the transcription factors p63 and p73 are the most widely
studied mutant p53-interacting proteins. Mutant p53 binds to p63 and p73 at their target
gene promoters to antagonize their activities.3,7,16-18

Author Manuscript

Despite the growing list of protein-coding genes whose transcription is inhibited by mutant
p53, little is known about the regulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) by mutant p53. MiRNAs
are an abundant class of small non-coding RNAs (~22 nucleotides (nt)) transcribed by RNA
polymerase II as long primary transcripts (pri-miRNAs). Mammalian miRNAs bind to the 3′
untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs via partial complementarity to inhibit
translation and/or promote mRNA decay,19-21 with far-reaching regulatory effects. Target
recognition involves base pairing between the miRNA seed region (nt 2–7 at the 5′ end of
the miRNA) and the target mRNA.19,21 However, a perfect seed match is not necessary for
gene suppression by miRNAs.22,23 Global downregulation of miRNAs has been often
observed in human cancers, suggesting that a majority of miRNAs function as tumor
suppressors. Although most miRNAs act to fine-tune target gene expression, some,
including let-7 and miR-34a, act as master regulators of important biological processes.24,25

Author Manuscript

Recent studies have demonstrated a close relationship between p53 and miRNAs.26 In
response to DNA damage, wild-type p53 directly induces the transcription of some miRNAs
including miR-34a.27,28 However, not much is known about the involvement of miRNAs in
mutant p53 gain of function. In the present study we have investigated the effects of mutant
p53 on miRNA expression. Our findings suggest that a key mechanism by which mutant p53
promotes migration, invasion and metastasis is through downregulation of let-7i, resulting in
derepression of a network of oncogenic let-7i target genes.

RESULTS
Mutant p53 regulates the expression of several miRNAs including let-7i

Author Manuscript

To identify mutant p53-regulated miRNAs, we sequenced small RNAs from the p53-null
H1299 cells (lung cancer) stably transfected with empty vector (EV) or the hot-spot
aggressive mutant p53R273H (Supplementary Figure S1A). With an arbitrary cutoff of 1.5fold (≥100 reads), 38 miRNAs were upregulated and 3 were downregulated in H1299p53R273H cells (Figure 1a, Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). The oncogenic miR-155 was
the most highly upregulated (~27-fold) and the tumor suppressor let-7i was significantly
downregulated (~1.6-fold). To validate these results, we performed TaqMan miRNA qRTPCR and observed consistent upregulation (~1.5- and ~ 10-fold) of miR-20b and miR-155,
whereas let-7i levels significantly declined (approximately twofold) in H1299-p53R273H
cells (Figure 1b). The abundance of let-7i primary transcript (pri-let-7i) significantly
decreased (approximately twofold), whereas the transcript encoding the miR-155 host gene
(miR-155-HG) was upregulated (approximately twofold) by p53R273H (Figure 1c),
indicating transcriptional regulation. The observed upregulation of miR-155 by mutant p53
has also been reported recently.29

Author Manuscript

Although miR-155 was upregulated >10-fold, the number of reads of miR-155 (13 in
H1299-EV and 356 in H1299-p53R273H cells) suggested that it was not abundant in these
cells. On the other hand, the number of reads of let-7i (8623 in H1299-EV and 5323 in
H1299-p53R273H cells) indicated robust let-7i expression. Indeed, let-7 is highly expressed
in many tissues including lung.30 As a single miRNA can regulate hundreds of genes,
abundant miRNAs are likely to be more potent regulators of gene expression. We therefore
hypothesized that let-7i has a role in mutant p53 gain of function and focused on
understanding the regulation and function of let-7i downstream of mutant p53.

Author Manuscript

To further validate let-7i as a mutant p53 target, we transiently transfected H1299 cells with
EV, wild-type p53 or p53R273H-expressing constructs for 48 h and observed consistent
downregulation of let-7i (approximately twofold) by p53R273H (Figure 1d). Although,
miR-34a, a well-established direct target of wild-type p53,27 was upregulated by wild-type
p53, let-7i was downregulated only by p53R273H, indicating that downregulation of let-7i
was not due to residual wild-type p53 activity (Figure 1d). The expression levels of wildtype p53 and p53R273H were similar in these experiments (Figure 1e). Moreover, let-7i was
repressed by mutant p53 in isogenic DLD-1 cells (colorectal cancer) (Figures 1f and g,
Supplementary Figure S1B) and in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines (Supplementary Figure
S1E, Supplementary Table S3). In addition to let-7i, another let-7 family member, miR-98,
was also downregulated by mutant p53 (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary Figures
S1C, D). We next examined whether let-7i expression was associated with mutant p53 in a
clinically relevant setting. Indeed, let-7i was less abundant (approximately threefold, P =
0.0028) in breast cancer patient samples with mutant p53 (N = 15) as compared with patients
that expressed wild-type p53 (N = 15) (Figure 1h, Supplementary Table S4), further
establishing let-7i as a target of mutant p53.

Mutant p53 and p63 associate with the let-7i promoter to regulate let-7i transcription

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Human let-7i is transcribed from chromosome 12 as a monocistronic primary transcript
(~750 nt).31 Our recent study32 suggested a potential mutant p53-binding site in a 2461-bp
region upstream of transcription start site (TSS). We therefore inserted this let-7i promoter
region upstream of firefly luciferase gene of pGL4 (Figure 2a) and performed luciferase
assays. As compared with H1299-EV cells let-7i promoter activity was significantly reduced
(~40%) when the let-7i promoter construct (pGL4-let-7i) was transfected for 36 h into
H1299-p53R273H cells (Figure 2b, left panel). Silencing mutant p53 in H1299-p53R273H
cells with p53 siRNAs for 48 h increased luciferase expression (~1.5-fold) (Figure 2b, right
panel). Immunoblotting verified efficient knockdown of mutant p53 (Supplementary Figure
S2A). To complement these results, we next examined the effect of transiently overexpressing p53R273H in H1299 cells on let-7i promoter activity. As compared with EVtransfected cells, let-7i promoter activity was significantly reduced by exogenous mutant
p53 (Figure 2c), suggesting that mutant p53 represses let-7i transcription.
To further establish let-7i as a direct target of mutant p53, we stably knocked down mutant
p53 in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (p53R280K) and the pancreatic cancer cell
line MIA-PaCa-2 (p53R248W) using two different p53-shRNAs (Supplementary Figures
S2B, C). Stable depletion of mutant p53 significantly elevated let-7i and pri-let-7i levels
(Figures 2d and e) in both cell lines, suggesting that endogenous mutant p53 represses let-7i
transcription.

Author Manuscript

Mutant p53 drives migration, invasion and metastasis by inhibiting the transcriptional
activity of p63 or p73.10,17,18,33 We therefore tested the interaction between p63, p73 and
mutant p53 by immunoprecipitation (IP) from MDA-MB-231and A431 (p53R273H) cells.
Consistent with previous reports,10,16,34 mutant p53 co-immunoprecipitated with p63 and
p73 in both cell lines (Figure 2f, Supplementary Figures S2D, E). To determine whether
mutant p53, p63 and/or p73 bind to the let-7i promoter, we performed chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays from MDA-MB-231cells. We observed specific
enrichment (greater than threefold) of the let-7i promoter with anti-p53 or anti-p63 (Figure
2g) but not with anti-p73 IP (data not shown). Two control regions located 2756–2868 bp
(CTL#1) and 2644–2750 bp (CTL#2) upstream of the let-7i TSS did not bind to p63 or
mutant p53, demonstrating the specificity. Moreover, transfection of MDA-MB-231 or
A431 cells with CTL or p63 siRNA for 48 h significantly downregulated p63 mRNA
(Supplementary Figure S2F), pri-let-7i and let-7i (Figure 2h, Supplementary Figure S2G),
suggesting that p63 enhances let-7i transcription.

A mutant p53–p63 complex regulates let-7i transcription through p63
Next, we inserted into pGL4, a 2071 bp let-7i promoter region lacking the ~ 400-bp region
that was bound by mutant p53 and p63 and designated this construct as Δ400 (Figure 3a).
Bioinformatic analysis (TRANSFAC) of this 400 bp region indicated a 25-nt p63-binding
element located 116 nt upstream of the let-7i TSS (Supplementary Figure S3A). In order to
further dissect the transcriptional regulation of let-7i by mutant p53/p63, we used sitedirected mutagenesis to delete this putative p63-binding element from the full-length let-7i
promoter construct (Δp63RE, Figure 3a). Luciferase assays were performed after

cotransfecting pGL4, pGL4-let-7i (FL), Δ400 or Δp63RE constructs with CTL, p53 or p63
siRNAs in MDA-MB-231 cells for 48 h. Silencing mutant p53 significantly increased (~3.5fold) luciferase activity of FL but to a lesser extent with Δ400 and Δp63RE (Figure 3b).
Depletion of p63 showed less-pronounced luciferase activity (approximately twofold) of FL,
whereas the luciferase activity from Δ400 and Δp63RE was comparable to the control. This
result indicates that mutant p53 inhibits p63 in a ~ 400-bp region upstream of the let-7i TSS
and mutant p53/p63-binding site is required for transrepression. To further confirm this
result, we inserted the ~ 400-bp fragment into pGL3 and performed luciferase assays after
transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with CTL, p63 or p53 siRNAs. Knockdown of mutant p53
significantly increased, whereas silencing p63 significantly decreased luciferase expression
(Supplementary Figures S3A, B), suggesting that the 400-bp region requires p63 to drive
let-7i expression

To assess whether mutant p53 and p63 bind to the let-7i promoter individually or as a
complex, we performed ChIP assays after transfecting MDA-MB-231 cells with CTL, p63
or p53 siRNAs. Silencing p63 not only abolished the binding of p63 to the let-7i promoter
region but also reduced the binding of mutant p53 (Figure 3c). As expected, silencing
mutant p53 abolished the binding of mutant p53 to the let-7i promoter but we also observed
increased binding of p63 to the let-7i promoter, indicating that mutant p53 inhibits binding
of p63 to the let-7i promoter. Consistent with this result, the association of p63 and mutant
p53 was not disrupted by DNase treatment (Figure 3d). We validated these results using a
sequential IP strategy, in which we transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with EV or a HA-p63expressing construct for 48 h and performed ChIP using anti-HA beads. The eluate from
anti-HA ChIP was divided into two fractions. The first fraction was subjected to qPCR (after
reversing the cross-links) for the let-7i promoter region. As expected, we observed
significant enrichment of the let-7i promoter region in the HA-p63 ChIP (Figure 3e). The
second fraction was diluted in IP buffer and subjected to mutant p53 ChIP. Significant
enrichment of the let-7i promoter region was observed in the mutant p53 ChIP (Figure 3e),
suggesting that a mutant p53-p63 complex binds to the let-7i promoter. As a control
experiment, over-expression of HA-p63 was verified by immunoblotting (Figure 3f).
Moreover, luciferase activity driven by the let-7i promoter increased upon over-expression
of HA-p63 and this effect was reduced when mutant p53 was co-transfected with HA-p63
(Figure 3g). These results suggest that a mutant p53–p63 complex binds to the let-7i
promoter through p63 and that mutant p53 inhibits the occupancy of p63 on the let-7i
promoter.
Introduction of let-7i in mutant p53 cells inhibits cell migration, invasion and metastasis

Author Manuscript

Mutant p53 has been shown to promote cell migration and metastasis of MDA-MB-231
cells.7 Consistent with this report, we observed significantly decreased invasion upon stable
knockdown of mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Supplementary Figures S4A and C). To
determine the downstream consequences of let-7i downregulation by mutant p53, we reintroduced let-7i in the highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells and determined the effect on
migration and invasion. MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with a control (CTL) miRNA
(cel-miR-67) mimic or let-7i mimics (10 nM) for 36 h and the effect on migration and
invasion was monitored by transwell migration and matrigel invasion assays. Introduction of

let-7i significantly impaired (approximately twofold) the migration and invasion of MDAMB-231cells and also inhibited migration of MIA-PaCa-2 cells (Figures 4a–c). Consistent
with the known antiproliferative function of let-7,30,35 let-7i inhibited proliferation of MDAMB-231 cells (Supplementary Figure S4D) but this effect was observed after 3 days of
transfection and not at earlier time points when the migration or invasion assays were
performed, indicating that the anti-migratory or anti-invasive effect of let-7i was not due to
inhibition of proliferation.

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the anti-invasive effect of let-7i in mutant p53 cells in vivo, we transfected
MDA-MB-231cells with CTL or let-7i mimics for 36 h and injected the cells into the tail
vein of mice. After 8 weeks, the recipients were killed and the lungs were evaluated for the
presence of metastatic tumors. Strikingly, MDAMB- 231 cells expressing let-7i displayed a
dramatic reduction (~15-fold, P < 0.0001) in lung metastatic colonization (Figure 4d,
Supplementary Figure S4E). These results established let-7i as an important downstream
effector of mutant p53 gain of function in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, although we
observed ~ 2000-fold increase in let-7i levels when MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected
with let-7i mimics (10 nM) (Figure 4e), the abundance of let-7i in Ago2 IPs (Figures 4f and
g) was near physiological levels, increasing only ~ 10-fold (~5-fold in CTL and ~ 50-fold in
let-7i mimic-transfected cells). This result is consistent with a recent study36 and suggest
that a majority of the transfected miRNA is not incorporated into the RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC).
let-7i inhibits the expression of a highly connected network of genes centered on MYC

To understand the mechanism(s) by which let-7i caused the observed phenotypic effects, we
re-introduced let-7i in H1299-p53R273H cells and performed microarrays to identify the
genome-wide targets of let-7i. Although this approach cannot identify let-7i targets that are
translationally regulated, it is likely that this strategy will identify a large proportion of let-7i
targets, based on recent studies.27,30,37 We therefore performed microarrays after
transfecting H1299-p53R273H cells with CTL or let-7i mimics (10 nM) for 36 h. Using an
arbitrary cutoff of twofold (P-value < 0.05), 72 unique mRNAs were downregulated
(Supplementary Table S5). LIN28B, a known target of the let-7 family,38 was the most
significantly downregulated. Several known let-7 targets30,39,40 including DICER (2.4-fold),
E2F5 (2.8-fold) and NRAS (2.3-fold) were also downregulated >2-fold, but some wellestablished let-7 targets30,41 including AURKB (1.9-fold) and MYC (1.6-fold) were not. With
a lower threshold of 1.5-fold (P-value < 0.05), 375 unique mRNAs were downregulated
(Supplementary Table S5), of which 153 (~41%) were also predicted by TargetScan (Figure
5a), suggesting that a significant proportion of the down-regulated transcripts may be direct
let-7i targets. Similar to MDA-MB-231 cells (Figures 4e–g), we observed ~ 2500-fold
increase in let-7i levels upon transfection of let-7i mimics in H1299-p53R273H cells but
association of let-7i in Ago2 IPs was not supraphysiological (Supplementary Figures S4F,
G).
Next, we performed gene ontology (GO) analysis on the 375 mRNAs downregulated by
let-7i. Consistent with the well-established anti-proliferative function of let-7,30,35 cell
cycle, cell growth and proliferation were among the top two overrepresented processes

(Figure 5b). Many genes that promote proliferation belonged to these two categories,
including AURKB, CCND1, CDC25A, E2F2, E2F5, MYC and NRAS. Interestingly, RNA
post-transcriptional modification was the third most significantly enriched GO process; 18
out of the 20 genes annotated for RNA post-transcriptional modification were
downregulated by let-7i (Supplementary Table S7). Among these, DICER1 is a known
target of let-7.39 The other 17 included genes implicated in the miRNA pathway, such as
EIF2C2 (encoding Ago2) and TARBP2, DDX56 (encoding an RNA helicase) and CPSF1,
which encodes a protein that has a central role in pre-mRNA splicing. The 375 genes
downregulated by let-7i formed a network centered on MYC and its interacting gene
products that are key factors in the control of cellular proliferation including AURKB,
CCND1, CDC25A, E2F2, E2F4, E2F5 and E2F6 (Figure 5c). In addition, many genes
involved in RNA metabolism, such as CPSF1, DICER1, DDX18, DDX56, EIF2C2, LIN28B
and XPO5 also interact with each other or with MYC. These analyses suggest that let-7i
inhibits the expression of a network of genes that have pivotal roles in control of
proliferation and RNA metabolism.

Author Manuscript

We next looked at the overlap of select genes known to be transcriptionally activated by
mutant p533 and the 375 mRNAs downregulated by let-7i. Out of the 62 genes
(Supplementary Table S8) whose transcription is upregulated by mutant p53,3 E2F542 and
MYC43 were also repressed by let-7i, suggesting that these mRNAs may be derepressed due
to downregulation of let-7i. Next, we searched for known MYC and E2F targets in the genes
downregulated by let-7i by performing Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for the 222
genes downregulated by let-7i that were not predicted let-7i targets (Figure 5a). Notably, we
found significant enrichment of MYC (P = 0.0013, 29 genes) and E2F (P = 0.0033, 10
genes) motifs in the promoters of these genes (Supplementary Table S9), suggesting that
decreased MYC and E2F levels upon let-7i over-expression may have a role in
downregulating some indirect let-7i targets.
The 3′ UTR of many cell cycle and RNA metabolism genes is repressed by let-7i

Author Manuscript

To validate the microarray results, MDA-MB-231 and H1299-p53R273H cells were
transfected with CTL or let-7i mimics and 36 h later qRT-PCR was performed. The levels of
known let-7 targets E2F5, HMGA1, LIN28B, MYC and NRAS declined substantially (greater
than twofold) (Figure 6a, Supplementary Figure S5A). We next validated 11 out of 18 RNA
post-transcriptional modification genes. Among these 11 genes, DICER1 is a known let-7
target39 and was downregulated more than fourfold (Figure 6b, Supplementary Figure S5B).
Expression of the other 10 let-7i targets (CPSF1, DDX18, DDX56, EIF4A1, EIF2C2, LSM6,
PABPC4, RBM38, TARBP2 and ZC3H3) declined more than twofold (Figure 6b,
Supplementary Figure S5B). Among these 10 mRNAs, 4 are predicted let-7i targets and 6
contain at least one 6-mer seed match in their 3′ UTR (Supplementary Table S10).
Downregulation of CPSF1 and MYC protein was also validated by immunoblotting (Figure
6c). These results suggest that let-7i inhibits the expression of many oncoproteins that
promote proliferation, migration and invasion.44,45
To investigate whether the let-7i targets were downregulated through their 3′ UTRs, we
inserted their 3′ UTRs in psiCHECK2. When luciferase assays were performed from H1299-

p53R273H cells cotransfected for 48 h with luciferase reporters and CTL or let-7i mimics,
the 3′ UTR of eight out of nine genes (CPSF1, DDX18, EIF4A1, LSM6, PABPC4, RBM38,
TARBP2 and ZC3H3) was significantly repressed by let-7i (Figure 6d); E2F5 3′ UTR was
used a positive control. To determine whether a subset of these genes was also regulated by
endogenous let-7i, we measured their mRNA levels by qRT-PCR after silencing let-7i in
parental H1299 cells with a let-7i sponge. Silencing let-7i elevated the levels of 8 out of 10
let-7i target mRNAs, further indicating that a majority of these genes are regulated by let-7i
(Figure 6e). Significant increase in CPSF1 and MYC protein levels was also observed with
the let-7i sponge (Figure 6f). Moreover, elevated let-7i levels upon stable knockdown of
mutant p53 in MDA-MB-231 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells was associated with downregulation of
some of these let-7i targets (Supplementary Figures S5C, D). Next, we performed qRT–PCR
to measure the expression of select let-7i targets in breast cancer patient samples where we
observed decreased let-7i levels in patient samples that had mutant p53 (Figure 1h). In
mutant p53 patient samples, the mRNA levels of E2F5, LIN28B and MYC were upregulated,
whereas NRAS mRNA levels didn’t change significantly (Figure 6g). Based on the results of
this study we propose a model in which a mutant p53–p63 complex inhibits let-7i
transcription to elevate the levels of transcripts encoding oncoproteins such as E2F5,
LIN28B, MYC and NRAS and specific RNA metabolism genes, including CPSF1, DDX18
and LIN28B (Figure 6h). Deregulation of these genes by the mutant p53/let-7i axis may
promote cellular proliferation, migration and invasion driven by mutant p53.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Despite the expanding list of mutant p53-regulated genes, only a handful of recent
studies29,46-48 have investigated miRNAs downstream of mutant p53. Here we identified
mutant p53-regulated miRNAs and demonstrate that the tumor suppressor let-7i is a direct
target and a key downstream mediator of mutant p53. Our findings are consistent with recent
studies suggesting the role of distinct p53 mutants in regulating miRNAs including
miR-128,46 miR-15529 and miR-130b.48 Further studies are required to assess what
proportion of the 41 mutant p53-regulated miRNAs are direct targets of p53R273H and/or
p63–p53R273H complexes. In addition to p63, mutant p53 may also regulate miRNAs
through other mutant p53-interacting proteins including NF-Y,12 ETS-1,14 ETS-232 and
VDR.49

Author Manuscript

The human let-7 family consists of 10 distinct miRNAs25 with identical seed sequences. Our
results indicate that mutant p53 downregulates let-7i, unlike MYC and LIN28B that inhibit
the expression of a majority of let-7 family members.50,51 However, we have shown that
inhibition of let-7i by mutant p53 has functional outcomes. Introduction of let-7i in MDAMB-231 cells reduced migration and invasion and dramatically inhibited metastasis. A
recent study showed that Twist suppresses let-7i levels and promotes a mesenchymal
movement of head and neck cancer cells52 by upregulating NEDD9 and DOCK3, leading to
RAC1 activation. However, these mRNAs were not altered by let-7i in our microarrays,
suggesting that they may not be downstream of the mutant p53/let-7i axis.
Our microarray analysis identified many established let-7 targets including E2F5, LIN28B,
MYC and NRAS. Stable knockdown of mutant p53 elevated let-7i and downregulated its

target mRNAs indicating that these genes are regulated by the mutant p53/let-7i axis.
Moreover, the let-7i targets E2F5 and MYC have been shown to be transcriptionally
upregulated by mutant p53,42,43 suggesting that the mutant p53/let-7i axis has a role in
elevating MYC and E2F5 levels. In addition to these genes, we have shown that let-7i
directly inhibits the 3′ UTR of several RNA post-transcriptional modification genes
including CPSF1, DDX18, LIN28B and TARBP2. Among these genes, DDX18 has a role in
cell cycle progression,53 whereas LIN28B promotes migration, invasion and
transformation. 44,54 A recent study suggested that CPSF6 (a homolog of CPSF1) is a direct
target of mutant p53 and silencing CPSF6 inhibits migration of mutant p53 cells.10 We
propose that downregulation of let-7i by mutant p53 increases the expression of CPSF1,
DDX18 and LIN28B to promote cell cycle progression, migration and invasion.

Collectively, our results suggest that in addition to transcriptional regulation, mutant p53
indirectly exerts its oncogenic functions post-transcriptionally, by downregulating let-7i.
Although our findings establish let-7i as a direct and functionally important target of mutant
p53, further studies are needed to determine the mechanism of biogenesis and function of
other mutant p53-responsive miRNAs identified in our study.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture, transfections and plasmids

Author Manuscript

H1299 cells stably expressing EV or p53R273H and HA-p63 construct were a kind gift from
K Vousden. All cell lines were maintained in DMEM with 10% fetal calf serum (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. MiRNA mimics were purchased from
Dharmacon (Lafayette, CO, USA) and reverse-transfected (10 nM) using RNAimax
(Invitrogen). let-7i-luciferase promoter construct (pGL4-let-7i) was a gift from S O’Hara.31
Sponge constructs for let-7i were a kind gift from M Yang.52 pGL4-let-7i (Δ400) and
(Δp63RE) deletion construct were generated by PCR or site-directed mutagenesis. The 3′
UTR constructs for luciferase assays were generated by PCR (Supplementary Table S12).
Stable transductions
Retrovirus expressing shRNA-targeting luciferase (CTLsh), p53 shRNA3 p53 shRNA4 was
generated in 293T cells. MDA-MB-231 and MIA-PaCa-2 cells were transduced with
retrovirus and stably transfected cells were selected after 48 h with puromycin (1.0 μg/ml).
H1299 cells were transfected with let-7i sponge (pmCherry-spg-let-7i) or a control vector
(pmCherry-spg-ctrl) for 48 h and selected after 48 h using puromycin (1.0 μg/ml).

Deep sequencing of small RNAs
Total RNA was isolated using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA)
and quantified using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Wilmington, DE, USA).
RNA integrity was evaluated with a 2100 BioAnalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA).
The small RNA fraction (18–30 nt) was enriched from 10 μg total RNA using 15%
denaturing trisborate-EDTA (TBE) urea polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE).
Purified small RNAs were ligated to proprietary 3′ and 5′ RNA adapters (Illumina) and used
as templates for cDNA synthesis. cDNA PCR amplification was performed using adapter-

specific primers (12 cycles), purified using TBE-PAGE and diluted to 8 pM for cluster
generation and sequencing on an Illumina GAII. Adapter sequences were clipped and
subsequently analyzed using BWA. Coordinates of mature miRNAs were downloaded from
miRBase (v18) and tag densities were counted and averaged over the length of the mature
miRNA.
RNA isolation, qRT–PCR and microarrays
Isolation of total RNA followed by qRT–PCR (Supplementary Table S11) and microarrays
were performed as previously described.22
Migration and invasion assays

Author Manuscript

For transwell migration assays, MDA-MB-231 or MIA-PaCa-2 cells were transfected with
CTL mimic or let-7i mimic for 36 h and 4 × 105 cells were plated in the top chamber with
the non-coated membrane (24-well insert; pore size, 8 μm; BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA,
USA). For invasion assays, matrigel (BD biosciences) was polymerized in transwell inserts
for 45 min at 37 °C. Transfected cells or MDA-MB-231 (CTLsh, p53sh3 and p53sh4) were
plated in the top chamber in medium without serum. In both assays, the lower chamber filled
with 10% FCS and 25 ng/ml EGF (Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) was used as a
chemoattractant. Cells were incubated for 24 h and the cells that did not migrate or invade
through the pores were removed by a cotton swab. Cells on the lower surface of the
membrane were stained with crystal violet and counted.
In vivo metastasis assays

Author Manuscript

Animal studies were performed under a protocols approved by the National Cancer Institute
Animal Care and Use Committee following AALAAC guidelines and policies. MDAMB-231 cells were reverse-transfected with CTL or let-7i mimics (50 nM). Thirty-six hours
after transfection, the cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS and suspended in PBS at a
concentration of 5 × 106 cells/ml. A total of 0.1 ml cell suspension was injected into 6–8week old female athymic nude mice (Animal Production Program, Frederick, MD, USA)
through the tail vein (N = 10) each group. Eight weeks after inoculation, the mice were
killed by CO2 narcosis. Histologically detectable metastases were enumerated on
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections of inflated lungs.
Luciferase reporter assays
Luciferase reporter assays were performed using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega, Milwaukee, WI, USA) as previously described.22

Introduction of let-7i in cell lines expressing endogenous mutant p53 inhibits cell migration,
invasion and metastasis. MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse-transfected with CTL or let-7i
mimics for 36 h and cell migration or invasion was assessed by transwell migration assays
(a) and matrigel invasion assays (b). (c) MIA-PaCa-2 cells were transfected with CTL or
let-7i mimics for 36 h and the effect of let-7i on cell migration was assessed by transwell
migration assays. (d) MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse-transfected with CTL or let-7i
mimics and metastasis to the lung was assessed 8 weeks after tail vein injection. Results are
median ± interquartile range. Representative lung cross sections shows large metastases
formed from CTL but not let-7i-transfected cells. (e) let-7i over-expression in MDAMB-231 cells was determined by qRT–PCR from total RNA. (f) Specific enrichment of

let-7i inhibits the 3′ UTR of multiple oncogenes and RNA post-transcriptional modification
genes. MDA-MB-231 cells were reverse-transfected with CTL or let-7i mimics for 36 h and
changes in mRNA expression of known let-7 targets (a) and novel targets (b) identified in
the microarrays were validated by qRT–PCR normalized to UBC. (c) MDA-MB-231 cells

and CTL or let-7i mimics. (e) Effect of silencing let-7i in H1299 cells with a let-7i sponge
(let-7i-Spg) on the expression of let-7i target mRNAs was assessed by qRT–PCR. (f)
Expression of CPSF1 and MYC protein from H1299 stably transfected with CTL-spg or
let-7i sponge (let-7i-Spg) was measured by immunoblotting. β-actin was used as loading
control. (g) mRNA levels of E2F5, LIN28B, MYC and NRAS were measured in breast cancer
patient samples that were wild-type for p53 (WTp53) or had a missense mutation in p53
(MTp53) by qRT–PCR relative to GAPDH. (h) Schematic model suggesting a mechanism
by which mutant p53 drives cell cycle progression, migration and invasion. Mutant p53
(MTp53) inhibits let-7i expression by inhibiting p63 at the let-7i promoter to upregulate
let-7i targets including NRAS, MYC, E2F5, LIN28B, DDX18 and CPSF1 to enhance
cellular proliferation, migration and invasion. Error bars represent mean ±s.d. of three
independent experiments. *P < 0.05; #P < 0.01; **P < 0.005; ##P < 0.001.
