The core components of the Hippo pathway are
conserved from flies to mammals [1]. In humans, these
include a kinase cascade initiated by the Hippo kinase
MST1/2 associated with the adaptor protein WW45/
SAV1, and LATS1/2 in complex with MOB1, which
in turn, phosphorylates and inhibits the mammalian
transcription co-activator YAP and its related protein TAZ
[1]. YAP plays a critical role in organ size control during
development, and its persistent nuclear localization and
activation contributes to multiple human malignancies
[1]. The mechanisms driving YAP activation in most
cancers, however, are often not clearly understood. In
recent studies [2, 3], we and Guan’s team found that YAP
activation represents a key molecular event contributing
to uveal melanoma, the most frequent ocular malignancy
in adults. Uveal melanoma growth is driven by gainof-function mutations in GNAQ or GNA11 oncogenes,
encoding persistently active G protein α subunits of the
Gq family [4]. As the signaling capacity of G proteins and
their coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been extensively
investigated, these findings provided an opportunity to
identify cancer-associated mechanisms resulting in YAP
activation, and to explore whether YAP represents a
suitable oncotarget for cancer treatment.
The oncogenic potential of GNAQ was initially
revealed by a systematic analysis of the transforming
potential of G proteins and GPCRs [5]. Gαq stimulates
PLCβ and the consequent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ levels
and diacylglycerol (DAG) production, which stimulate
classical PKCs and ERK (Fig. 1). The latter mimics
the impact of B-RAF or N-RAS oncogene mutations in
cutaneous melanomas [4]. However, inhibitors of the
ERK pathway increase progression free survival but has
a limited impact in overall survival of uveal melanoma
patients [6], suggesting that GNAQ can activate oncogenic
signaling circuitries circumventing ERK inhibition. In this
regard, a genome wide screen revealed that the activation
of growth promoting gene programs by Gαq involves the
stimulation of Rho GTPases through the direct activation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor known as Trio
[5]. Indeed, we found that YAP activation by GNAQ is
dependent Trio and its regulated Rho GTPases, RhoA and
Rac1, but not on PLC-generated second-messengers [2].
The detailed analysis of YAP activation by GNAQ
in uveal melanoma helped identify a novel signaling
mechanism controlling YAP function. Specifically,
while Gq-coupled GPCRs diminish the negative
phosphorylation of YAP by inhibiting LATS, in uveal
melanoma cells LATS1/2 remains partially active, hence
YAP dephosphorylation may not be sufficient to explain
its overactivity [2]. We found that the accumulation of
polymerized F-actin upon Rho-GTPase activation is
critical for YAP stimulation by GNAQ [2], aligned with the
role of F-actin in YAP activation during mechanosensing
signaling (reviewed in [7]). In search for the underlying
mechanism, we found that F-actin accumulation causes
the release of YAP bound to AMOT, thereby promoting an
increase in the free-YAP pool that can then translocate to
the nucleus and regulate gene expression [2].
Our study [2] and recent reports (reviewed in [7])
provided a new mechanistic insight into how cytoskeletal
changes can regulate YAP function. YAP (and TAZ), are
part of multiple cytosolic protein complexes established
by the direct interaction between the WW domains of
YAP with PPxY motifs found in most YAP-associated
proteins, including LATS and AMOT (reviewed in [7]).
YAP binding to LATS facilitates YAP phosphorylation
and its subsequent inactivation by the association of
phospho-YAP with 14-3-3 or its degradation by the
proteasome. Instead, AMOT inhibits nuclear YAP function
by sequestering it in the cytosol (reviewed in [7]). As
AMOT’s PPxY motifs are adjacent to its F-actin binding
region, polymerized actin competes for YAP binding
thereby increasing free YAP, while actin depolymerization
and increase in G-actin will result in the accumulation of
inactive, AMOT-bound YAP protein complexes [2, 7] (Fig.
1).
These YAP pools are likely dynamically regulated

Figure 1: The GNAQ and GNA11 uveal melanoma oncogenes encode persistently activated heterotrimeric G protein
α subunits of the Gαq family. Gαq activates classical cytosolic second messengers as well as guanine nucleotide exchange factors

activating the small GTPases Rho and Rac, which in turn promote the stimulation of the YAP transcriptional co-activator by a cytoskeletalmediated mechanism resulting in YAP dissociation from AMOT and its related proteins. The dynamic regulation of YAP molecular
complexes and its distinct pools by the canonical Hippo pathway and Gαq, and the therapeutic potential of targeting active nuclear YAP
are described in the text.

(Fig. 1). AMOT represses YAP but competes for LATS
binding to YAP, hence protecting YAP from its inactivation
by LATS. LATS can also phosphorylate AMOT,
preventing its binding to F-actin (reviewed in [7]), thus
providing a feedback mechanism favoring the stability of
the AMOT-YAP transcriptionally inactive pool. Robust
activation of cytoskeletal changes can however result
in the dissociation of YAP from AMOT (and its related
AMOTL1 and AMOTL2), suggesting that AMOT may act
as a YAP inhibitor or facilitate YAP activation depending
on the status of actin polymerization. In turn, the interplay
between these distinct cytosolic and nuclear YAP pools
may help explain how actin polymerization controls YAP
during the transduction of mechanosensing signals. As
AMOT orthologs are not found in Drosophila, additional
mechanisms might exist controlling the interplay between
YAP pools in flies and perhaps in mammals, which
warrants further investigation.
These findings may have direct clinical relevance,
as recent drug screens revealed that a family of porphyrin
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

-related molecules can inhibit the interaction of YAP
with TEAD transcription family members [8]. Among
them, verteporfin (VP) is already a FDA-approved drug
for eye disease indications such as macular degeneration.
Remarkably, VP can potently inhibit uveal melanoma
tumor growth in experimental systems [2, 3], suggesting
that YAP may represent a suitable therapeutic target
for the treatment of uveal melanoma and other human
malignancies characterized by unrestrained YAP function.
