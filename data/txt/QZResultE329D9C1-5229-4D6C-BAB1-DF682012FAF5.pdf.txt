ABSTRACT
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been widely used as a
complementary medicine in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) treatment. In
this study, we proposed a new classification of Chinese Medicines (CMs)
by integrating the latest discoveries in disease molecular mechanisms and
traditional medicine theory. We screened out a set of chemical compounds on
basis of AML differential expression genes and chemical-protein interactions
and then mapped them to Traditional Chinese Medicine Integrated Database.
415 CMs contain those compounds and they were categorized into 8 groups
according to the Traditional Chinese Pharmacology. Pathway analysis and
synthetic lethality gene pairs were applied to analyze the dissimilarity,
generality and intergroup relations of different groups. We defined hub CM
pairs and alternative CM groups based on the analysis result and finally
proposed a formula to form an effective anti-AML prescription which combined
the hub CM pairs with alternative CMs according to patients’ molecular
features. Our method of formulating CMs based on patients’ stratification
provides novel insights into the new usage of conventional CMs and will
promote TCM modernization.

INTRODUCTION

under 60 years old are suggested to take chemotherapy
because of the incidental grievous damage to normal cells,
leaving seldom treatment options for the rest patients [4].
Therefore, it is urgent to propose alternative strategies on
AML intervention.
Synthetic lethality (SL) signifies an interaction
between two genes which will induce apoptosis when
they are simultaneously perturbing the same cells while
absence of either gene will take no effect. The increasing
number of identified SL gene pairs provides a promising in
selective cytotoxicity to tumor cells and meantime reduces
side effect of traditional chemotherapy [5]. Therefore,
researchers working on AML treatments are seeking the

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is one of the
hematopoietic malignancies characterized by uncontrolled
proliferation of myeloblast. On contrary to advances
in cytogenetic analysis at diagnosis and prognostic
stratification, the pharmacology therapy researches of
AML seem to be barely satisfactory which remain almost
unchanged for nearly 40 years [1, 2]. Hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation and chemotherapy are the main
medical approaches for AML treatment, but the outcome is
not ideal with the five year survival rate of AML patients
appropriately low to 20% [3]. In addition, only patients

SL therapy. A prototypical example is the application of
PARP inhibitors [6] that can effectively kill cancer cells
while spare normal tissue [7].
Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), especially
herbal medicine, as a complementary and alternative
medicine treatment, has been widely utilized in cancer
treatment. For instance, clinical evidence clarified that
therapeutic schedule combined modified Shengma Biejia
Decoction with CAG (cytarabine, aclacinomycin and
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) program was
beneficial for patients in relieving clinical symptoms and
enhancing physical quality [8]. Another ancient drug,
Arsenic (Pi Shuang), is well known for its substantial
therapeutic effect on acute promyelocytic leukemia and
has been accepted as a standard treatment [9, 10]. The
conventional recognition in Chinese medicines (CMs) is
based on various experience of predecessors. However,
in the past few decades, scientists have focused their
attention on extracting effective chemical components in
CMs and unveiling the pharmacological mechanisms of
them, contributing to the discovery of anti-cancer herbs
such as Panax notoginseng (San Qi) [11] and Pinellia
ternate (Ban Xia) [12]. Although researches on herbal
monomer can decipher the therapeutic function of herbs
to some extent, they cannot be representative of the
complete multi-targets curative effect of herbs and most
pharmacological activities in herbs remain underestimated.
Presently, bioinformatics methods are burgeoning
in avenues of TCM-related researches like mechanism
analysis on complex herbal prescriptions [13]. The
emergence of comprehensive databases such as Traditional
Chinese Medicine Integrated Database (TCMID) [14] and
TCM Database@Taiwan [15] made it possible for largescale analysis in TCM. Targets of therapeutic compounds
can be acquired through various open access databases
which remind us of the possibility of delving more specific
effect herbs and reclassifying them in a new perspective
way.
In this study, as described in the schematic diagram
(Figure 1), we adopted 596 differential expression genes
(DEGs) reported based on AML RNA-seq data [16]
and detected hub proteins through calculating degree of
protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and literature survey.
Chemical compounds highly correlated with the hub
targets were then acquired. Thereupon, CMs containing
those chemical compounds were selected and grouped
into 8 categories based on traditional theory of TCM. SL
gene pairs and pathway analysis were applied to analyze
dissimilarity, generality and intergroup relations of
different categories. Finally, we proposed 415 suggested
anti-AML CMs and proposed a rational combination
scheme to formulate an effective prescription. Our
method to select a group of CMs for a special disease
by combining the latest research progresses of disease
mechanisms with the traditional theory shows promise
of modernized personalized CMs and delivers a new
prospective on old CMs.

Defining hub targets in DEGs
A set of DEGs (596) for AML have been reported
based on AML RNA-seq data [16], which includes
306 down-regulated genes and 290 up-regulated genes
(Supplementary Table 1). We made a literature survey on
the 596 DEGs to identify critical proteins contributing to
the progress on AML. The investigation indicated that 43
proteins encoded by DEGs have explicit influence on AML
including negative correlation with adverse prognosis
(ATP1B1, HOXB4, MN1) [17-19] and promoting cell
proliferation (DLL3) [20]. These 43 proteins were
defined as key proteins (Supplementary Table 2). Human
PPIs were extracted from InWeb_InBioMap database to
generate an interaction network [21]. The 596 proteins
were mapped to PPI network to identify potential hub
proteins with high degree. 149 proteins failed to find
any interacted proteins while the rest 447 ones were
successfully matched. Totally, 447 proteins have 7,494
interactive partners and the degree of them in the network
was listed in descending order in Supplementary Table 3.
197 proteins respectively encoded by 111 down-regulated
genes (OBSL1, MYH9, ATXN1, etc.) and 86 up-regulated
genes (BMI1, DBN1, CD81, etc.) possess greater than or
equal to 25 interactions, covering 31 key proteins. The
197 proteins and the rest 12 key proteins were selected
out as hub targeted proteins for the subsequent CMs
identification.

Network-based CMs selection
STITCH compiled reliable experimental and
predictive data of chemical-protein interactions along
with a detailed score for the confidence interval [22].
Chemical-protein interactions involving one of the 209
selected hub proteins with confidence range greater than
or equal to 0.9 (high confidence) were selected which
ensure the bioactivity of the compounds. Totally, we
obtained 2928 interactions, covering 109 proteins and 963
chemical compounds. To detect the CMs that contain those
963 chemical compounds, we mapped them to TCMID.
122 compounds were successfully matched with CMs’
ingredients in TCMID, covering 592 chemical-protein
interactions with 86 DEGs. The chemical compounds
included small molecules such as adenosine triphosphate
and calcium, and TCM active substance such as coumari
and amygdalins (Figure 2a and 2b). Interference on
calcium transport through calcium channel blockers has
been a successful attempt on delaying the progression of
some malignancies including AML which is sensitive to
the cytosolic calcium concentration in experiments [23,
24]. Meanwhile, extracellular magnesium concentration
43580

might expedite the AML cell differentiation through
interfering with calcium homeostasis [25]. However,
impact of those TCM active substance on AML has
seldom been studied.
458 CMs were selected at the very beginning after
mapping the compounds to TCMID. After excluding
the unconventional medication, such as Penis et Testes
Callorhini (Hai Gou Shen), Penis Cervi (Lu Bian) and
Ferri (Tie pian), and those CMs with severer side effect
such as Aristolochia manshuriensis (Guan Mu Tong)
and Aristolochia fangchi (Mu Fang Ji), 415 CMs with
complete annotation in TCMID were retained. Top of the
list was Panax ginseng (Ren Shen) whose ingredients
targeted 83 proteins encoded by DEGs (37 up-regulated
DEGs and 46 down-related DEGs), followed by the
Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum (Lu Rong), Semen Astragali
Complanati (Sha Yuan Zi) and Cistanche deserticola (Rou
Cong Rong) targeted 71, 61 and 61 proteins respectively.
We categorized the 415 CMs into 8 groups in
accordance with the Traditional Chinese Pharmacology,
namely exterior-releasing herbs (21, 5%), antirheumatics
(64, 15%), heat-clearing herbs (123, 29%), tonic herbs (98,
24%), hemostyptic (28, 7%), hemorheologic agent (21,
5%), energen-regulating drugs (45, 11%) and others (18,
18.4%) (Figure 3, Supplementary Table 4). The number
of targeted proteins encoded by DEGs was calculated to
assess the anti-AML efficiency of groups. The average

protein targets for 8 groups were 12.1, among them,
tonic herbs, hemorheologic agent and exterior-releasing
herbs have the most targets with 14.9, 14.5 and 13.5,
respectively (Figure 4). We also found that CMs targeting
the most proteins were almost assigned to tonic herbs.

Pathway analysis
Pathway enrichment analysis was carried out for
AML DEGs and targets of each group (Supplementary
Table 5, Supplementary Table 6). Enrichment result
showed that the AML DEGs were involoved in 23
pathyways while the CM targets were involved in 205
pathways with 17 pathways overlapped between them
(Table 1). There were 35 pathways shared among the
8 categories including chemokine signaling pathway,
calcium signaling pathway, Fc epsilon RI signaling
pathway and neuroactive ligand-receptor interacion,
accounting for a 16.8% proportion (Figure 5). The 35
common pathways represented the generality among
different groups for targeting the same set of pathways.
Chemokine signaling pathway was also one of the
AML DEGs involved pathways. Studies comfirmed
that chemokine signaling pathway and Fc epsilon RI
signaling pathway were sharply activated in HL-60 cells
[26]. Activation of intracellular calcium signaling might
be a promising way to stimulate leukemia blasting into

dendritic cells and make progress on antileukemia vaccine
strategies [27].
Except for antirheumatics and energen-regulating
drugs, the rest of the categories possessed unique
pathways. The common pathways indicated that CMs in
different categories played similar function while those
unique pathways in each category represented its specific
funtions. Tonic herbs seemed to be the most specificity
group affecting 12.1% (13 out of 107) peculiar pathways,
including acute myeloid leukemia, ribosome and adherens
junction. Both ribosome and adherens junction play
important role in leukemic stem cell biology and cancer
course [28].

SL gene pairs. Among them, Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum
(Lu Rong), belonging to the tonic herbs, act on 5 AMLrelated SL gene pairs (including the 2 high confidence
pairs) i.e., BRCA1-TP53 (0.82046875), CHEK1-TP53
(0.85), PNKP-PTPN6 (0.56), ATM-TP53 (0.56) and
FLT3-MAPK8 (0.56), while Panax ginseng (Ren Shen)
works on 4 of them (except for PNKP-PTPN6). The rest
three CMs are Ilex cornuta (Gou Gu), Camellia sinensis
(Ye Cha Ye) and Folium camelliae sinensis (Lv Cha).
In addition to AML-related gene pairs, 4 CMs also can
induce other kind of SL which may lead to toxic or side
effect. To be detailed, Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum (Lu
Rong), Panax ginseng (Ren Shen), Camellia sinensis
(Ye Cha Ye) and Folium camelliae sinensis (Lv Cha) can
induce 65, 66, 3, 3 other SL gene pairs, respectively. These
5 CMs were regarded as effective CMs for AML therapy.
Apparently, Ilex cornuta (Gou Gu) seems to be the most
safety CM. We further looked over the explicit action of
the 5 CMs on the 43 key proteins (Supplementary Table
7). The investigation suggested an ambiguous role of
Panax ginseng in AML treatment while the other 4 CMs
seems to benefit for anti-AML treatment. Although it
suppresses cancer invasion through reaction on ITGB5
[30], Panax ginseng may also stimulate bone marrow blast
by activating CTGF [31]. Hence, we filtered out Panax
ginseng from the hub CMs. Then, we used medicine data
from Drugbank to compare the targets of the 4 CMs with
the targets of western medicine using for AML treatment.
Until now, only 5 medicines were approved by FDA for
AML treatment and a target of Cornu Cervi Pantotrichum

Synthetic lethality gene pairs in CM
Synthetic lethality has been suggested in the
cancer treatment, which can selectively initiate apoptosis
in cancer cells while spare normal cells. To detect the
potential synergetic effect of those ingredients on the
targets, we downloaded data of SL gene pairs in homo
sapiens from SynLethDB [29]. According to the data,
only two gene pairs are related to AML with confidence
score > 0.7, i.e. BRCA1-TP53 (0.82046875) and CHEK1TP53 (0.85). We collected the whole ingredients and
targets for those 415 CMs and mapped them to the SL
data to investigate whether these ingredients can act on
the SL gene pairs. We discovered that ingredients of 5
CMs had effect on high confidence ( > 0.7) AML-related

(Lu Rong), PRKCD, is overlapped with the targets of a
recorded medicine Ingenol Mebutate (Accession Number:
DB05013) which further verify the effectiveness of the
chosen CMs.
Furthermore, 758 herb-herb pairs (covering 201
kinds of CMs) were suggested to have the function of
inducing SL (Supplementary Table 8). As shown in Figure
6, 255 CM pairs formed between tonic herbs and heatclearing herbs groups, ranking as the highest rates when
compared with the rest group combinations. The intragroup effective CM pairs also can only be found in these
two groups. When the CMs target the AML-related SL

pairs, they also work on other genes with SL effect, which
might result in toxic or side effect. Therefore, to avoid the
potential severe side effect, it is reasonable to exclude the
CMs pairs that affect a high proportion of genes with SL
effect that are unrelated to AML in prescription.

Formulating an effective anti-AML prescription
On basis of above analysis result, we proposed
a formula for an effective anti-AML prescription with
the combination of hub CMs pairs and alternative

CMs according to patients’ molecular features. 4 CMs
targeting genes with SL effect were defined as hub CMs
in prescription. According to the classification, herbs
targeting most proteins encoded by DEGs belong to
tonic herbs, hemorheologic agent and exterior-releasing
herbs with average value of 14.9, 14.5 and 13.5. Pathway
analysis further manifested the vital function of tonic
herbs. Fortified SL effect can be acquired through a joint
action in hub CMs and the 201 other herbs in which tonic
herbs, hemorheologic agent and exterior-releasing herbs
are preferable groups to yield the greatest intervention on
AML DEGs. The CMs associated for joint action were
defined as hub CMs pairs. Varying clinical manifestation
or molecular features of a patient will serve as the
selective basis of alternative CMs and the 415 CMs would
serve as herb set for option. For these reasons, a formula
for an effective anti-AML prescription was suggested to
be a combination of hub CMs pairs with alternative CMs
as following:
Prescription = Hub CMs pairs + Alternatives CMs

in clinical application, physicians still face the challenge
in research-based CMs chosen because of the complexity
of herbal compounds. Hence, we try to meliorate
conventional TCM practice with modern medical
technology by integrating molecular features of diseases
and CMs ingredient information.
AML DEGs, human PPIs and herbal compounds
were jointly exploited to select the potential effective CMs
for AML treatment. Finally, we screened 415 from 8,159
compiled CMs in TCMID. Some of the herbs have been
proved to be beneficial for leukemia therapy. For example,
Semen Astragali Complanati (Sha Yuan Zi) was found to
inhibit acute promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL-60 [32].
In addition, proliferation of leukemia cell line K562 was
likely to be suppressed by echinacoside, one ingredient
of Cistanche deserticola (Rou Cong Rong) [33].The
major herbs of Shengma Bie-jia Decoction (Cimicifuga
dahurica [Sheng Ma], Carapax Trionycis [Bie Jia],
Angelica sinensis [Dang Gui] and Glycyrrhiza uralensis
[Gan Cao]) has been verified to be beneficial for relieving
clinical symptoms, are also in our screened CMs.
According to the classification, herbs targeting
most proteins encoded by DEGs belong to tonic herbs,
hemorheologic agent and exterior-releasing herbs.
Pathway analysis for the targets of 8 CMs groups revealed
the function generality and peculiarity in each group.
Chemokine signaling pathway is the only one involved
in each of the 8 groups and AML DEGs, indicating a
common biological process among groups. The enriched
specific pathways in each group are responsible for the
function peculiarity. Adherens junction is also one of the

DISCUSSION
TCM, as a traditional medical intervention, has
been widely used in Asian countries for several thousand
years. One of the characteristics and advantages in
TCM is individualized treatment which is coincident
with the mission of current popular precision medicine.
Recognition approaches for CMs have altered from
semplice experience accumulation to experimental
researches aiming at compound identification. However,

pathway influenced by AML DEGs. As shown in Figure
7, targets of the group almost filled up proteins between
the up-regulated DEGs and down-regulated DEGs in the
pathway.
SL is a double-edged sword in cancer treatment.
Based on the data in SynLethDB, we identified 4 herbs
whose ingredients could target high confidence AMLrelated SL gene pairs, so as 758 herb-herb pairs coming
from 201 herbs, which suggested 201 (48.3%) screened
CMs might be potential drugs for selective AML treatment
(Table 2, Supplementary Table 8). Each herb-herb pair
contains at least one of the hub CMs. In consideration
of drug safety, CM pairs with high proportion of AMLrelated SL gene pairs and targeting few other SL pairs are
recommended in clinical practice.
In TCM theory, heat-clearing herbs, exteriorreleasing herbs and hemorheologic agent are mostly
applied in the early stage of cancers while tonic herbs are
widely used in the late stages of cancer when patients have
weakened immune system resulting from cancer treatment
such as chemotherapy. Whereas, our work found out that
an appropriate combination between tonic herbs and other
CMs such as heat-clearing herbs and hemorheologic agent
might be beneficial for AML patients in the entire disease
treatment process. CMs pairs in Table 2 which contains at
least one of the hub CMs is offered for choosing the hub
CMs combination. Variations of clinical manifestation or
molecular features of a patient will serve as the selective
basis of alternative CMs.
To demonstrate the application of our strategy for
personalized CMs, we took Shengma Biejia Decoction as
an example. We found that the major herbs of Shengma
Biejia Decoction belong to tonic herbs (Glycyrrhiza
uralensis [Gan Cao], Carapax Trionycis [Bie Jia] and
Angelica sinensis [Dang Gui]), the most essential CM
group, while Cimicifuga dahurica (Sheng Ma) is one of
the exterior-releasing herbs which serve as fever reducer.
To make the formula comply with AML patients with
different molecular features, we did some modification to
it. As indicated in the analysis result, 3 hub CMs, Camellia
sinensis (Ye Cha Ye), Folium camelliae sinensis (Lv Cha)
and Ilex cornuta(Gou Gu), can induce SL when combined
with Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui). To maximize the
targeting proteins encoded by DEGs in the formula, we
proposed to add Folium camelliae sinensis (Lv Cha) (or
Camellia sinensis [Ye Cha Ye]), one of heat-clearing
herbs as the extension, because 3 CMs in the decoction
are already from tonic herbs.
To further enhance the SL effect with more
coverage of the targeting proteins, we selected CMs from
hemorheologic agent group based on the 758 identified
herb-herb pairs, resulting in 4 frequently-used herbs.
Based on the effect variation of the 4 herbs, ShengmaBiejia Decoction can be formulated into 3 different
prescriptions for 3 different clinical features (Figure 8).
To be specific, prescription 1 is appropriate for patients
suffering expectoration and prescription 2 is for patients

with significant abdominal pain syndrome, while
prescription 3 is appropriate for patients suffering joint
pain.
Currently, no systematic clinical evidence has
proved that TCM can significantly influence the survival
rates of any cancers, but as a complementary therapy,
TCM has shown its value [34]. Nevertheless, during
the past hundreds of years, guiding theory of the usage
of CM remains nearly unchanged and progresses in
latest achievements of herbs have not been incorporated
into the practice of TCM, which seriously restrict the
development of TCM. The wide usage of next generation
technologies in the biomedical fields has greatly facilitated
our understanding of underlying mechanisms of various
diseases, including cancers, which promotes the disease
treatments into precision medicine era. Considering that
individual difference on molecular level can be detected
by regular test in the nearly future, personalized TCM
treatment would be synchronously realized. Our method
of formulating CMs based on patient underlying molecular
features provides novel insights into the new usage of
conventional CMs and will promote TCM modernization.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Different expression genes in AML patients
We adopted the DEGs in AML patients identified
by Zachary J Faber and his colleagues in 2016. A total of
596 DEGs were figured out in their research by carrying
out whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing analysis
for 165 samples (both adults and pediatric) with RUNX1RUNX1T1 or CBFB-MYH11 rearrangements.

Protein-protein interaction data
Homo sapiens protein-protein interaction data was
extracted from InWeb_InBioMap, Proteins encoded by
DEGs were mapped to the global PPIs to seek out the hub
proteins. In this step, we identified 197 hub proteins which
harbored greater than or equal to 25 interactions as the
hub proteins for herb selection. Some studies defined the
hub proteins as those ones proteins that who interacted
with ≥10 partners [35]. The criterion was set over 10 years
ago by that time, the human protein interactions have not
been recognized so comprehensive. In our study, for the
chosen DEGs, more than half of them interacted with ≥ 10
partners based on currently enriched protein interaction
data, it indicates that the previous criterion for hub protein
selection is no longer applicable in current study. Thus,
we took a 1.5-fold change to the suggested number (≥25)
which covered only 20% of the DEGs. The networks
visualization was realized through Cytoscape software
(version 3.4.0) [36].

(STITCH 5, http://stitch.embl.de) provides interactions
between proteins and small molecules. Each interaction
was along with a predicted confidence score which 0.7
was suggested as the divider line for high confidence [37].
We raised the cutoff of confidence score for chemical
chosen to 0.9 to ensure the biological activities. After the
filtration, 961 chemical compounds correlating with 108
hub proteins were picked out.

(TCMID, http://www.megabionet.org/tcmid/) is one of
the authority available database for recording Chinese
herb ingredients and herbs. The above-mentioned 961
chemical compounds were mapped to TCMID for herb
selection and 106 compounds were successfully matched
with ingredients of herbs. Finally, 415 herbs with complete
annotation were singled out. Those 415 herbs were them
classified into 8 categories according to the Traditional

Synthetic lethality gene pairs
Synthetic lethality database (SynLethDB, http://
histone.sce.ntu.edu.sg/SynLethDB/) complied SL gene
pairs on human species. Since the SL gene pairs may
cause side effects, we lowered the scores to 0.7 instead
of 0.9 as the cutoff for SL gene pairs chosen. Then the
mapping result found 201 CMs involved in the AMLrelated SL processes.
