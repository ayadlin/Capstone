ABSTRACT
Adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) is an often fatal malignancy caused by infection
with the complex retrovirus, human T-cell Leukemia Virus, type 1 (HTLV-1). In ATL
patient samples, the tumor suppressor, p53, is infrequently mutated; however, it has
been shown to be inactivated by the viral protein, Tax. Here, we show that another
HTLV-1 protein, HBZ, represses p53 activity. In HCT116 p53+/+ cells treated with the
DNA-damaging agent, etoposide, HBZ reduced p53-mediated activation of
p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A expression, which was associated with a delay in
G2 phase-arrest. These effects were attributed to direct inhibition of the histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p300/CBP by HBZ, causing a reduction in
p53 acetylation, which has be linked to decreased p53 activity. In addition, HBZ
bound to, and inhibited the HAT activity of HBO1. Although HBO1 did not acetylate
p53, it acted as a coactivator for p53 at the p21/CDKN1A promoter. Therefore, through
interactions with two separate HAT proteins, HBZ impairs the ability of p53 to activate
transcription. This mechanism may explain how p53 activity is restricted in ATL cells
that do not express Tax due to modifications of the HTLV-1 provirus, which accounts
for a majority of patient samples.

INTRODUCTION

response, apoptosis and in its own regulation [5, 6].
Although certain posttranslational modifications may serve
redundant functions, there appears to be separate patterns
of acetylation and phosphorylation of p53 that favor
either cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or, alternatively,
apoptosis [6]. Regardless of these complexities, it is clear
that acetylation of p53 is essential in promoting either of
the two cellular fates [7].
In general, acetylation has been shown to augment
the transcriptional activity and stability of p53. For
example, acetylation of lysine residues within the
C-terminal domain of the protein have been found

The tumor suppressor, p53, is a central regulator
of genome stability in mammalian cells. Following DNA
damage, p53 becomes acetylated and phosphorylated
at multiple sites, thereby shifting the protein from an
unstable, latent form to one that is stable, active and
concentrated in the nucleus [1]. This transition allows
p53 to bind to promoters of genes involved in cell cycle
arrest, such as p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A, and
activate their transcription [2–4]. p53 is also able to
regulate expression of genes involved in the DNA damage

to induce conformational changes that may enhance
DNA-binding activity and interactions with other
transcriptional regulatory proteins [8–10]. In addition,
acetylated lysine residues in p53 may be shielded from
ubiquitination by Mdm2 and other E3 ubiquitin ligases
that mark p53 for proteosomal degradation [11, 12].
Furthermore, these modified lysine residues may enhance
interactions between p53 and coactivators, thereby
facilitating the recruitment of these coactivators to
promoters [13, 14].
p300 (also designated KAT3B), was the first histone
acetyltransferase (HAT)-carrying protein found to acetylate
p53 [9]. Of the six HAT proteins reported to acetylate p53,
p300 is responsible for the most extensive acetylation
of this factor, modifying five lysine residues in the
C-terminal domain of p53 (K370, K372, K373, K381 and
K382) [9], one lysine residue in the DNA-binding domain
(K164) [7], and one lysine residue positioned between
these two domains (K305) [15]. This observation implies
an important role for p300 in regulating p53 activity,
as acetylation of different lysine residues in p53 may elicit
redundant effects [10], and at least partial acetylation of
p53 is required for its transcriptional activity. Acetylation
of p53 by p300 frequently contributes to activation of
p21/CDKN1A expression, promoting cell cycle arrest,
while effects on apoptotic gene expression, such as that of
PUMA, appear to vary with cell type [16]. In addition to
directly modifying p53, p300 contributes to p53-mediated
transcriptional activation via its coactivator function and
through histone acetylation at promoters bound by p53.
Another
HAT-containing
protein,
histone
acetyltransferase bound to ORC1 (HBO1, KAT7, MYST2),
also interacts directly with p53 [17]. Unlike p300, HBO1
has not been reported to acetylate p53, even though it is
involved in activating transcription of p53-responsive
genes, including p21/CDKN1A [18]. HBO1 has also been
shown to contribute to transcriptional activation through
interactions with hormone nuclear receptors and AP-1
transcription factors [19–21]. Outside of its transcriptional
functions, HBO1 helps modulate replication by serving as
a coactivator for the replication licensing factor, CDT1
[22, 23]. In this context, HBO1 loading onto the chromatin
promotes chromatin structure remodeling and subsequent
recruitment of putative DNA helicase MCM2-7 [23].
Given the fundamental role of p53 in maintaining
genome stability, in more than half of all cancers, it is
functionally disabled through mutation [24]. In those cancer
cells that retain wild-type p53, defects frequently occur in
other components required for proper p53 function [6].
For example, multiple types of leukemia/lymphoma
show a high frequency of mutations within the genes
encoding p300 and CBP that abolish the HAT activities
of these homologous proteins and prevent full acetylation
of p53 [25–27]. Furthermore, tumor viruses have evolved
mechanisms to inhibit p53 activity. One example is
the complex retrovirus, human T-cell Leukemia Virus
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

type 1 (HTLV-1), which is the etiologic agent of adult
T-cell leukemia (ATL), a fatal malignancy characterized
by uncontrolled proliferation of CD4+ T-cells [28]. While
most ATL cells express wild-type p53 [29, 30], the function
of the tumor suppressor is consistently impaired [31]. This
effect has been attributed to the HTLV-1-encoded protein,
Tax [32], which has been reported to inhibit p53 activity
either by stimulating NF-κB signaling or by sequestering
p300/CBP from p53, or through a separate, undefined
mechanism [33–36]. In lieu of these reports, ATL cells
from most patients do not express Tax due to deletion or
methylation of the 5′ long terminal repeat (LTR) of the
HTLV-1 provirus [37–39] which regulates expression of
the tax gene and all other viral genes with the exception
of hbz [28]. The hbz gene is consistently expressed in ATL
cells [40, 41], as it is encoded on the negative strand of the
provirus and regulated by a promoter in the 3′ LTR that
does not undergo the same modifications as the 5′ LTR
[28, 42]. This gene encodes the nuclear protein, HTLV-1
basic leucine zipper (bZIP) factor (HBZ) [42].
We previously found that HBZ interacts with
multiple domains of p300/CBP, including the HAT
domain [43]. The binding of HBZ to the HAT domain
inhibits its enzymatic activity, which reduces p53
acetylation following induction of DNA damage [44].
In the current study, we evaluate the effect of HBZ on
p53 transcriptional activity. Using HCT116 cells, in
which the p53 signaling pathway is intact, we found that
HBZ reduces transcription of the p53-responsive genes,
p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A, which contribute to cell
cycle arrest. Mechanistically, this effect occurs through
inhibition of the HAT activities of both p300 and HBO1.
Functionally, this effect delays the onset of G2/M arrest
induced by etoposide. These results indicate that HBZ
contributes to the loss of function of p53 observed during
HTLV-1 infection and maintains p53 in an inactive state in
ATL cells lacking other viral proteins.

RESULTS
HBZ inhibits p53 transcriptional activity on
specific genes
We previously showed that HBZ inhibits p53
acetylation by the homologous coactivators, p300 and
CBP [44]. Given that this modification contributes to the
transcriptional activity of p53 following DNA damage
[16], it was possible that HBZ repressed expression
of genes activated by p53. To test this hypothesis, we
analyzed expression of p53-responsive genes in HCT116
cells that express wild type p53 (p53+/+) and are commonly
used to study the p53 pathway. In addition to p300 and
CBP, other HAT-containing proteins acetylate p53 [16],
and using western blot analysis, we confirmed that these
proteins are expressed in the HCT116 cell line (Figure 1A).
To examine potential effects of HBZ on expression of

p53-responsive genes, we transfected cells with either
an empty vector or an expression vector for the HBZ
splice 1 isoform (herein referred to as HBZ), which
is the predominant isoform expressed in ATL cells
[41, 45]. Etoposide was then used to induce p53
acetylation and activation [8], and RNA was extracted
and subjected to quantitative RT-PCR analysis. The
p53-responsive genes tested included those involved
in cell cycle inhibition (p21/CDKN1A, GADD45A),
regulation of p53 (MDM2, PIRH2), the DNA damage
response (GADD45, RRM2B), and induction
of apoptosis (BID, FAS, PUMA, NOXA, BAX)
[46]. As expected, etoposide treatment increased H2A.X
phosphorylation, consistent with the induction of DNA
damage (Figure 1A), and activated transcription of most
of the p53-reponsive genes (Figure 1B). While a general
trend was observed in which cells expressing HBZ
exhibited a reduction in the mRNA levels of the genes
tested, this effect was only significant for p21/CDKN1A
and GADD45A. Consistent with this effect, HBZ also
decreased p21/CDKN1A protein abundance following
etoposide treatment (Figure 1A). In untreated cells, HBZ
did not reduce the basal expression of these genes (data
not shown), which is the same result found with mouse
T-cells transiently expressing HBZ [47]. These results
suggest that HBZ affects the expression of only a subset of
p53-responsive genes with overlapping functions in
cell cycle inhibition. We also confirmed that etoposide
treatment did not affect the nuclear levels of the HATs
(Figure 1A, lanes 2 and 4). In these experiments the
transfection efficiency was estimated to be approximately
50%. Consequently, the reduction in p21/CDKN1A
and GADD45A mRNA was more pronounced when
comparing a HeLa clonal cell line stably expressing HBZ
to a clonal cell line carrying the empty vector (Figure 1C).
Considering that the oncogenic effects caused
by HTLV-1 infection arise in a T-cell environment,
we tested whether HBZ also reduced the extent of
p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A activation in the MOLT-4
T-cell line. While the status of p53 appears to vary among
different sources of this line [48, 49], the cells we tested
express the p53 protein [50, 51] and display activation of
p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A expression following
etoposide treatment. In analyzing cells transduced with HBZ
versus cells transduced with the empty expression vector, we
observed a smaller increase in the levels of p21/CDKN1A
and GADD45A mRNA in the presence of HBZ (Figure 1D),
consistent with results obtained using HCT116 and HeLa
cells. As with the transfected HCT116 cells, the modest effect
of HBZ may be due to a limited transduction efficiency.

transcription from the p21/CDKN1A promoter. The HAT
proteins p300, p/CAF (KAT2B), MOZ (KAT6A, MYST3)
and Tip60 (KAT5) participate in the activation of
p21/CDKN1A expression, in part through acetylation of
p53 [16]. In addition, the HAT protein, HBO1, contributes
to the activation of p21/CDKN1A expression through
a p53-dependent mechanism, but has not been reported
to acetylate p53 [18]. In experiments, we cotransfected
HCT116 cells with an expression vector for each HAT
protein and the WWP-Luc reporter construct, which
contains the p21/CDKN1A promoter, encompassing
the p53 responsive elements, upstream of the luciferase
gene [2]. Ectopic expression of p300, MOZ and HBO1
led to a significant increase in luciferase activity, while
expression of p/CAF and Tip60 did not (Figure 2A).
We additionally analyzed luciferase activity in cells
ectopically expressing both p300 and one of each of
the other HAT proteins. This approach was used to test
whether p300 modulates the effects of other HAT proteins
at the p21/CDKN1A promoter, as p300 has been shown to
regulate acetylation of the FoxP3 transcription factor by
Tip60 [52]. Interestingly, only expression of HBO1 with
p300 increased the level of activation beyond that of p300
alone (Figure 2A). This increase appeared to be additive,
suggesting that these two HATs have distinct functions in
the regulation of p21/CDKN1A expression.
Based on these results, we performed additional
reporter assays to test whether HBZ inhibits the effects
of p300 and HBO1 at the p21/CDKN1A promoter.
Interestingly, co-transfection of the HBZ expression
vector prevented both HAT proteins from activating
luciferase transcription (Figure 2B, lanes 3 and 6). We also
analyzed the effects of a bZIP deletion mutant of HBZ
(HBZ–ΔbZIP) based on previous data showing that the
bZIP domain of HBZ inhibits p300 HAT activity through
a direct interaction with the HAT domain [44]. In contrast
to full-length HBZ, HBZ-ΔbZIP did not block activation
from the promoter by either p300 or HBO1 (Figure 2B,
lanes 4 and 7). In the absence of exogenous p300 and
HBO1, both HBZ and HBZ-ΔbZIP caused a reduction in
luciferase activity. This effect was not investigated further,
but may arise from the interaction between HBZ and the
KIX domain of p300 [43].
We also examined the effects of HBZ on transcription
from the p21/CDKN1A promoter in Jurkat T-cells. In reporter
assays, cells were co-transfected with a p53 expression
plasmid, as Jurkat cells lack endogenous p53 expression
[53, 54]. Interestingly, HBZ did not affect the level of basal
transcription induced by p53 in the absence of stimulation
(Figure 3C, lanes 3 and 4). However, we found that etoposidemediated activation of transcription from the p21/CDKN1A
promoter was abrogated in presence of HBZ, but was retained
in the presence of HBZ-ΔbZIP (Figure 3C, lanes 6 and 7).
These observations are consistent with the results obtained
using HCT116 cells and indicate that HBZ is able to inhibit
p53 transcriptional activity in a T-cell environment.

HBZ inhibits acetylation of p53 at lysine K382
by p300/CBP

a reduction in p53 K382 acetylation in the presence
of HBZ (Figure 3A). However, HBZ did not affect
acetylation of K320, which is a substrate for p/CAF [57],
and K120, which is a substrate for Tip60, MOF and MOZ
[58–60] (Figure 3A).
To verify that the reduction in K382 acetylation
was a specific effect of HBZ, we tested whether another
HTLV-1-encoded protein, Tax, affected the level of
acetylation of this residue. Tax has been reported to
repress p53 activity through multiple mechanisms that
do not directly involve p53 acetylation [33–36]. As
expected, expression of Tax in HCT116 cells treated with
etoposide did not lead to an alteration in K382 acetylation

We previously showed that HBZ reduces
p53 K382 acetylation in HeLa cells [44]. These cells are
transformed by human papilloma virus 18 and therefore
express the viral protein E6 which also inhibits p53
activity [55]. To confirm that HBZ is able to reduce p53
K382 acetylation independent of this other viral protein,
we transfected the HCT116 cells with the HBZ expression
vector and subsequently treated the cells with etoposide
or other genotoxic agents to induce p53 acetylation
[12, 56]. Consistent with our previous results, we observed

by p300 and MOZ, we performed in vitro HAT assays
using recombinant proteins. We found that both p300 and
MOZ acetylated histones, indicating that both proteins
were enzymatically active (Figure 3C). However, only
p300 acetylated p53 at K382 (Figure 3D, top panel). As
this result was unexpected, we used a pan-acetyl-lysine

(Figure 3B), suggesting that HBZ regulates p53 activity in
a distinct manner from that of Tax.
Given that both p300/CBP and MOZ have been
reported to acetylate K382 of p53 [9, 60], we were
interested in determining which HAT protein is targeted
by HBZ. In order to differentiate between p53 acetylation

antibody in the assay and detected weak p53 acetylation
by MOZ in comparison to strong acetylation by p300,
which is known to acetylate at least eight lysine residues
[16] (Figure 3D, middle panel). This observation confirms
acetylation of p53 by MOZ, suggesting that in our
in vitro assays, acetylation of p53 by MOZ is restricted to
K120. Consistent with our previous study [44], addition
of full-length HBZ or the bZIP domain of HBZ reduced
K382 acetylation by p300, while addition of the activation
domain of HBZ did not affect acetylation (Figure 3E). As
previously observed, HBZ was acetylated in the reaction
[44]. These data suggest that inhibition of p300 HAT
activity by HBZ is responsible for the reduction in p53
K382 acetylation in the HCT116 cells, which contributes
to HBZ-mediated repression of transcription from the
p21/CDKN1A promoter.

We also tested whether HBO1 activated endogenous
expression of p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A. Using
HCT116 cells we found that treatment with etoposide
caused an increase in the level of p21/CDKN1A
and GADD45A mRNA; however, this increase was
significantly reduced by siRNA-mediated knockdown of
HBO1 expression (Figure 4E). Overall, the results above
indicate that HBO1 is recruited to the p21/CDKN1A
and GADD45A promoters where it participates in the
activation of p53-mediated transcription via its HAT
activity.

HBZ inhibits HBO1 HAT activity
Previous results from a yeast two-hybrid
analysis revealed that HBO1 interacts with HBZ
[62]. To confirm this finding in mammalian cells, we
co-transfected HEK293T/17 cells with expression
vectors for HBO1 and HBZ and found that each protein
was coimmunoprecipitated with the other (Figure 5A).
In addition, in H1299 cells, endogenous HBO1 was
coimmunoprecipitated with ectopically expressed HBZ
(Figure 5B). Together, these results suggest that HBZ
and HBO1 interact in a p53-independent manner. Using
a GST pull-down assay, we showed that GST fused to
full-length HBZ or the bZIP domain alone bound directly
to HBO1 (Figure 5C). These results indicate that the direct
interaction between HBZ and HBO1 is, in part, mediated
through the bZIP domain of the viral protein.
Considering that the bZIP domain of HBZ is
sufficient to inhibit p300 HAT activity through a direct
interaction with the coactivator [44], it was possible that
HBZ also inhibited the HAT activity of HBO1. To test
this hypothesis, we performed in vitro HAT assays using
recombinant histones as substrates. In comparison to p300,
HBO1 HAT activity was weaker and favored histone H4
(Figure 5D, lanes 2 and 3). Consistent with our hypothesis,
both full-length HBZ and the bZIP domain alone inhibited
HBO1 HAT activity, while the activation domain of HBZ
did not (Figure 5D, lanes 5–7). Unlike histones H3 and
H4, p53 was not acetylated by HBO1 (Figure 5E).
Using H1299 cells and the pG13-Luc reporter
plasmid we then tested whether HBZ inhibits p53
transcriptional activity augmented through HBO1. In the
absence of HBZ, p53 increased luciferase activity, which
was further elevated by ectopic expression of HBO1,
but not by HBO1G485 (Figure 5F, lanes 1, 3, 5 and 7).
Consistent with a previously study [63], HBZ did not
affect the activation of transcription by p53 alone (Figure
5F, lane 4); however, HBZ did inhibit the activation of
transcription coordinated through p53 and HBO1 together
(Figure 5F, lane 6).
While the effect on transcription is expected to stem
from the inhibition of HBO1 HAT activity, it was possible
that HBZ additionally influenced the recruitment of HBO1

HBO1 is a coactivator of p53 transcription
In addition to affecting p300, HBZ also blocked the
effects of HBO1 at the p21/CDKN1A promoter. In order
to define the mechanism of inhibition, it was important to
first determine the function of HBO1 at the p21/CDKN1A
promoter. Previously, HBO1 was found to be associated
with the p21/CDKN1A promoter, and shRNA-mediated
knockdown of p53 reduced transcriptional activation by
HBO1, suggesting that HBO1 activity was dependent on
p53 [18]. However, in a separate study, p53 was found
to bind to, and inhibit the HAT activity of HBO1 [17].
Consequently, we first tested whether HBO1 positively
or negatively affected p53 transcriptional activity from
a synthetic p53 responsive reporter plasmid (pG13-Luc),
using the p53-negative cell line, H1299. As expected,
transfection of increasing amounts of an HBO1 expression
vector did not activate transcription in the absence of p53
(Figure 4A). However, co-transfection of a p53 expression
vector led to a dose-depend increase in transcription in
response to HBO1, an effect that was abrogated by
substituting wild-type HBO1 with a HAT-defective
mutant, HBO1G485 [17, 61] (Figure 4A).
Based on these results, we used chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays to test whether p53
facilitates recruitment of HBO1 to the p21/CDKN1A and
GADD45A promoters. In HCT116 cells, p53 activation by
treatment with etoposide increased the level of enrichment
of both p53 and HBO1 at both promoters (Figure 4B).
This effect was not due to an increase in HBO1
expression (Figure 4D). In contrast to the p21/CDKN1A
and GADD45A promoters, the signal for both proteins
remained close to background at the BDNF promoter,
which is not regulated by p53 (Figure 4B). In H1299
cells, HBO1 was enriched at the HoxA9 promoter, as we
showed previously [23], but not at the p21/CDKN1A and
GADD45A promoters, regardless of etoposide treatment
(Figure 4C).

to the p21/CDKN1A promoter. To test this hypothesis, we
used ChIP assays to compare levels of HBO1 enrichment
at the promoter in a HeLa clonal cell line expressing HBZ
and one carrying the empty vector [64]. We analyzed
amplicons corresponding to the p53 responsive elements
in the promoter, the transcription start site and a distal
coding region (Figure 6A). In absence of HBZ, etoposide
treatment led to enrichment of HBO1 at the distal and
proximal p53 responsive elements, and more substantially,
at the transcription start site as previously reported
(Figure 6B, [18]). In comparison, cells expressing HBZ
exhibited a lower level of HBO1 enrichment at the

transcription start site following etoposide treatment
(Figure 6C). These results suggest that HBZ, in addition
to inhibiting the HAT activity, may also interfere with the
recruitment of HBO1 to the promoter in proximity of the
transcription start site.

HBZ delays cell cycle arrest induced by
etoposide treatment
Our data indicate that HBZ does not affect
p53-mediated activation of pro-apoptotic genes and
does not alter levels of p53 K120 acetylation, which is

associated with induction of apoptosis. To extend these
findings, we compared apoptotic cell populations between
HCT116 cells transfected with the HBZ or the empty
expression vector following etoposide treatment. As
expected, Annexin V and/or propidium iodide staining did
change significantly in the presence of HBZ, supporting
that HBZ does not suppress induction of apoptosis by
p53 (Figure 7A). It is important to note that, in these
experiments, dead cells were removed from cultures just

prior to the addition of etoposide. Indeed, while the HBZ
protein has also been reported to attenuate apoptosis [65],
results from one study have shown that the HBZ protein
induces apoptosis [66].
Finally, we were interested in determining whether
inhibition of p21/CDKN1A expression by HBZ is
associated with a reduction in p21/CDKN1A function.
p21/CDKN1A induces cell cycle arrest at the G1/S
[2, 3, 67] and G2/M checkpoints [68–73]. In addition,

GADD45A also promotes G2 arrest [74–76], and as
shown in Figure 1, its expression is reduced by HBZ
following etoposide treatment. To test whether HBZ
influences the G2/M checkpoint, we analyzed the effects
of the viral protein on etoposide-mediated cell cycle arrest
in HCT116 cells. In asynchronous cells, HBZ appeared
to reduce the sensitivity of cells to etoposide following
24 hours of treatment, as less HBZ-expressing cells
occupied G2 phase compared to cells transfected with
the empty expression vector (Figure 7B). However, it
was possible that this effect was due to a difference in
proliferation between HBZ and empty vector cells, as
HBZ has been shown to increase T-cell proliferation [40,
77]. Therefore, to show that results were specifically
due to a difference in cell cycle arrest, we repeated

experiments using synchronized cells and evaluated the
effects of etoposide at different time points. Following 24
hours of etoposide treatment, we again observed less HBZexpressing cells in G2 compared with cells carrying the
empty vector; however at 36 hours of treatment, the HBZexpressing cells appeared to arrest in G2 (Figure 7C).
Together, the results above indicate that HBZ delays G2/M
arrest induced by DNA damage.

DISCUSSION
In this study we provide evidence that HBZ reduces
p53-mediated activation of the cell cycle arrest genes,
p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A, following etoposide

treatment. Analysis of the p21/CDKN1A promoter in
reporter assays corroborated that repression by HBZ
occurred at the level of transcription and involved
repression of the HAT activities of p300 and HBO1.
In the case of p300, HBZ inhibited its ability to
directly acetylate p53. In addition to acting as a coactivator
for p53, p300 acetylates multiple lysine residues in p53,
including those in the C-terminal domain (K370, K372,

K373, K381 and K382) that, when acetylated, enhance the
DNA binding activity of p53 [9]. We found that expression
of HBZ consistently dampened K382 acetylation of p53
in response to various DNA damaging agents. In contrast,
HBZ did not appear to inhibit the HAT activities of other
proteins known to modify p53. Specifically, HBZ did not
appear to affect acetylation of K120, which is targeted
by either Tip60, MOF or MOZ [58–60], nor did it appear

to affect acetylation of K320, which is a substrate for
p/CAF [57]. In addition to p300, MOZ has been reported
to acetylate p53 at K382 [60]. We confirmed that HBZ
represses K382 acetylation by p300 in in vitro HAT
assays [44]. However, we were unable to detect K382
acetylation by MOZ in these assays despite the ability of
the recombinant, purified polypeptide to acetylate histone
proteins. Considering that we tested a truncated form of
MOZ (amino acids 497–780), encompassing the HAT and
acidic domains, it is possible that the p53 interaction is
mediated through a separate region of MOZ. Nevertheless,
we speculate that K382 acetylation in HCT116 cells
occurs primarily through p300 given that p300 elicited

a significantly greater increase in transcription from the
p21/CDKN1A promoter than MOZ in luciferase assays.
Interestingly, HBZ also repressed transcription
from the p21/CDKN1A promoter through inhibition of
HBO1. Recently, HBO1 was shown to localize to the
p21/CDKN1A promoter and activate transcription in
a p53-dependent manner [18]. This effect is likely to
involve a direct interaction between HBO1 and p53 that
was separately characterized [17]. Indeed, we observed
that HBO1 is recruited to the p21/CDKN1A promoter in
a p53-dependent manner and that the ability of HBO1
to augment transcriptional activity of p53 requires the
functional HAT domain. Our results indicate that HBZ

interferes with both processes given that HBZ inhibited
HBO1 HAT activity in vitro and caused a reduction in
the level of HBO1 associated with the promoter in cells.
As with p300, the bZIP domain of HBZ interacts directly
with HBO1 and is responsible for the inhibition of HAT
activity. It is intriguing that HBZ is able to inhibit the
HAT activities of both p300 and HBO1 considering the
divergence in the amino acid sequences between their
HAT domains. Future studies will determine whether
HBZ targets an amino acid motif that is shared between
these two proteins and explore the possibility that
HBZ exhibits similar inhibitory effects on other HAT
proteins.
The ability of HBZ to inhibit the HAT activities of
both p300 and HBO1 is likely to affect separate events
associated with p53-mediated transcription from the
p21/CDKN1A promoter (Figure 8). Our data indicate
that, by binding p300, HBZ inhibits acetylation of
p53, thereby reducing the transcriptional activity of

the tumor suppressor. In addition, HBZ may also affect
the coactivator function of p300 at the p21/CDKN1A
promoter [13, 78, 79]. Unlike p300, HBO1 has not been
reported to acetylate p53 [59], which we confirmed in this
study. Therefore, HBZ is likely to impede the ability of
HBO1 to acetylate histones at the p21/CDKN1A promoter.
Indeed, HBO1 serves as the HAT component of a protein
complex consisting of JADE and ING proteins, in which
it is responsible for acetylation of specific lysine residues
in histones H3 and H4 [80]. It is possible that HBO1 and
p300 cooperate in other nuclear processes. In Drosophila
the concerted HAT activities of CBP and the HBO1
orthologue, Chameau (Chm), hyperacetylate nucleosomes
at gene amplification origins, which is required in
the development of follicle cells [81]. In mammalian
cells, HBO1 and p300 regulate CDT1 function. p300
acetylates CDT1 to promote its accumulation while HBO1
interacts with CDT1 to support its ability to recruit the
MCM helicase [23, 82]. It would thus be of interest to

Figure 8: Model summarizing the effects of HBZ on p53-regulated transcription of p21/CDKN1A. Etoposide-induced

DNA damage, stimulates p53-dependent recruitment of p300 and HBO1 to the promoter (dashed blue arrows). During this process p300
acetylates p53 at K382 (ac-labeled arrow) and other lysine residues to increase the DNA-binding activity of p53 (solid blue arrow). HBO1
recruitment may be facilitated by associated ING and JADE/BRPF proteins, which interact with methylated histone H3 through their
PHD finger domains. These interactions may position HBO1 in proximity to the transcription start site, where it acetylates histones. By
inhibiting the HAT domains of p300 and HBO1, HBZ represses acetylation of p53 and promoter-associated histones. HBZ also restricts the
recruitment of HBO1, which may lead to further reduction in acetylation of histones at the promoter. The sum of the effects of HBZ is to
dampen the level of activation of p21/CDKN1A (and GADD45A) transcription, leading to a delay in cell cycle arrest induced by etoposide.

characterize the potential cooperative roles of HBO1 and
p300/CBP in replication licensing and determine whether
HBZ affects this process.
The effects of HBZ on the transcriptional response of
p53 is consistent with HBZ specifically counteracting cell
cycle arrest following etoposide treatment. For example,
acetylation of p53 at K382, which was reduced by HBZ,
potentially favors the activation of genes involved in cell
cycle arrest, while acetylation of p53 at K120, which was
not affected by HBZ, has been linked to apoptosis [83].
Consistent with this pattern, HBZ did not affect apoptosis,
but HBZ did dampened the G2/M phase arrest induced by
etoposide, which is expected to involve the reduction in
p21/CDKN1A as well as GADD45A expression. Indeed,
p21/CDKN1A contributes to cell cycle arrest in both the
G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle through its ability
to bind to and inhibit multiple cyclin/CDK complexes
(reviewed in [73]). GADD45A participates in cell cycle
arrest during the G2/M checkpoint, by also binding to, and
blocking activation of cyclin/CDK complexes [74–76].
In contrast to HBZ, another HTLV-1-encoded protein,
Tax, activates p21/CDKN1A expression, an effect that is
independent of p53 [84]. Tax exhibits oncogenic properties
and is believed to be essential for the development of
ATL [28, 84]. Therefore, effects of Tax observed in
HTLV-1-infected T-cell lines are often recapitulated in
ATL cells from patients, which would suggest the effect
of HBZ on p21/CDKN1A expression does not relate to
ATL. However, unlike HTLV-1 cell lines that express high
levels of p21/CDKN1A, expression of this gene is low to
undetectable in ATL cell lines and ATL patient samples
[85]. Therefore, although activation of p21/CDKN1A
expression by Tax may occur during the course of HTLV-1
infection, it does not appear to apply to ATL maintenance.
In addition to inducing cell cycle arrest following
stress, p21/CDKN1A and GADD45 promote senescence
[86], which is a process that is also associated with Tax
[87]. One of the many functions of Tax is to stimulate
NF-κB signaling that, when constitutively activated,
leads to increased expression of p21/CDKN1A and the
onset of cellular senescence [88]. Interestingly, HBZ
inhibits NF-κB signaling [44, 89], and this function is
reported to alleviate Tax-induced senescence [88]. Based
on results from our current study, it is possible that
HBZ also counteracts senescence by reducing levels of
p21/CDKN1A and GADD45A. In addition to these
effects, HBZ has also been reported to increase expression
of hTERT, the catalytic subunit of human telomerase
reverse transcriptase [90], which may support constitutive
telomerase activity, allowing cells to bypass senescence
[91, 92]. Therefore, HBZ potentially utilizes multiple
pathways to prevent senescence. Overall, by bypassing
DNA damage-induced cell cycle arrest and senescence,
cells expressing HBZ may accumulate mutations that
eventually contribute to the development of ATL.

HAT assays were performed as described [44] with
incubation times and specified protein amounts indicated
in the figure legends. Recombinant proteins p300, HBZ,
HBZ-AD1-122, HBZ-bZIP and histones were described
previously [44]. Recombinant protein HBO1 was obtained
from SignalChem Pharmaceuticals Inc. (specific activity
of 0.4 nmol/min/mg). p53 was expressed in E. coli, and
the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 M KCl, 10%
[vol/vol] glycerol, 1% [vol/vol] Nonidet P40, 10 mM
2-mercaptoethanol and 0.5 mM PMSF) and sonicated.
The cleared lysate was then batch-loaded onto nickel-NTA
agarose beads (Qiagen) and eluted with a 10 mM to 0.5 M
linear imidazole gradient (supplemented lysis buffer
containing 0.1 M KCl). Peak p53 fractions were combined,
dialyzed into HM 0.1, batch-loaded onto heparin-agarose
beads (Bio-Rad Laboratories), and eluted with a 0.1 to
1 M KCl gradient (supplemented HM). MOZ-HAT was
expressed in E. coli and purified using Ni-NTA agarose
beads (Qiagen) as described [103]. Eluted proteins were
dialyzed into HM 0.1.

Immunoprecipitation assays
HEK293T/17 (1.5 × 106 cells/10 cm plate)
were transfected for 24 hours, and whole cell extracts
were prepared as described [51]. Proteins were then
immunoprecipitated from 200–400 μg of whole cell
extracts as described [93] and analyzed by Western
blot. For immunoprecipitation of endogenous HBO1,
HBZ-Flag was transfected into H1299 cells for 48
hours, nuclear extracts were then prepared and HBZ
was immunoprecipitated with Flag-resin (A2220,
Sigma-Aldrich).

Cell cycle and apoptosis analyses
HCT116 p53+/+ cells were seeded at 5 × 105 cells in 6
well plates. Unsynchronized cells were treated with drugs
or carrier 48 hours after transfection then harvested at
indicated time points with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and 5 mM EDTA. To synchronize cells, 24 hours after
transfection, cultures were switched to serum-free medium
for 48 hours. Cells were released from growth-arrest
by addition of serum, then treated with drug or carrier
before harvesting in PBS/5 mM EDTA at the indicated
time points. Cells were washed and resuspended in PBS,
fixed in 70% ethanol, stained with 50 mg/mL propidium
iodide (Sigma), treated with RNase A (Sigma) and then
incubated at 25°C for 30 minutes. Fluorescence was
measured by flow cytometry using BD LSR II flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were analyzed with
ModFit LT (Verity). For Annexin V/PI staining, 48 hours
after transfection, cells were washed and then treated
with drug or carrier for 24 hours. Cells were subsequently
stained using the Dead Cell Apoptosis Kit with Annexin
V FITC and PI for flow cytometry (Life Technologies).
Fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry using BD
LSR II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data were
analyzed with FlowJo (FlowJo LLC).

GST pull-down assays
GST, GST-HBZ and GST-HBZ-bZIP were
expressed and purified as described [93]. His6-HBO1
was expressed in E. coli and purified as described [103].
Purified proteins were dialyzed in HM 0.1 (20 mM
HEPES [pH 7.9], 0.1 M KCl, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM
EDTA, 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.025% [vol/vol] Nonidet
P40, and 1 mM DTT). Glutathione-agarose beads were
equilibrated in 0.5x Superdex buffer (12.5 mM HEPES
[pH 7.9], 75 mM KCl, 6.25 mM MgCl2, 5 μM ZnSO4,
20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 0.05% [vol/vol] Nonidet P40,
1 mM EDTA and 1 mM DTT) and incubated with 25 pmol
of GST proteins at 4°C for 1 h. Beads were then washed
twice with 0.5 × Superdex buffer and combined with 10
pmol of His-HBO1. Binding reactions were mixed at 4°C
overnight, and beads were subsequently washed four times
with 0.5 × Superdex buffer and resuspended in loading
buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and
detected by Western blot.
