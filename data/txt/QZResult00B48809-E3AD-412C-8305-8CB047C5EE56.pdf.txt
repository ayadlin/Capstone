Abstract
Epileptic seizures are frequently caused by brain tumors. Traditional anti-epileptic
treatments do not acquire satisfactory responses. Preoperative and postoperative
seizures seriously influence the quality of life of patients. Thus, tumor-associated
epilepsy (TAE) is an important subject of the current research. The delineation of the
etiology of epileptogenesis in patients with primary brain tumor may help to find the
novel and effective drug targets for treating this disease. In this review, we describe
the current status of treatment of TAE. More importantly, we focus on the factors
that are involved in the functional connectivity between tumors and stromal cells.
We propose that there exist two modes, namely, long-range and short-range modes,
which likely trigger neuronal hyperexcitation and subsequent epileptic seizures. The
long-range mode is referred to as factors released by tumors including glutamate
and GABA, binding to the corresponding receptor on the cellular membrane and
causing neuronal hyperactivity, while the short-range mode is considered to involve
direct intracellular communication between tumor cells and stromas. Gap junctions
and tunneling nanotube network are involved in cellular interconnections. Future
investigations focused on those two modes may find a potential novel therapeutic
target for treating TAE.

Introduction

in the patients with the low grade astrocytoma while
glioblastomas carry a 29%-49 risk of epileptic seizures
[16], suggesting that malignancies are more epileptogenic
[17-21]. Similarly, in 508 Chinese adult patients with
low grade gliomas, there are 350 persons (accounting
for 68.9%) presented with seizures [22]. Metastatic brain
tumor can also induce seizures in about 25% of patients
[23]. Nearly 35% of brain tumor patients continue to
suffer from spontaneous seizure recurrence, known as
tumor-associated epilepsy (TAE), and these patients were
often refractory to widely used anti-epileptic drugs such as
Valproic acid and Phenytoin [24, 25]. The epileptogenesis
and treatment-related problems seriously decreased the
quality of life in patients with brain tumor. Up to date,

It has been established that primary brain tumors are
one of the most common and lethal cancers worldwide
[1-11]. The classification scheme of the World Health
Organization (WHO) [12] reports that brain tumors mainly
contain these types as follows: glioma, pituitary adenomas,
meningiomas, acoustic neurinoma, craniopharyngioma,
metastatic tumors.
Tumor microenvironment was shown to be an
important contributor to epilepsy in patients with brain
tumors and it is estimated that the incidence varies between
30% and 100% depending on the type of tumor [1315]. For instance, there is a 75% risk of epileptogenesis

the relationship between epileptogenesis and brain tumor
is poorly understood. It was previously hypothesized that
epileptogenesis might be associated with tumor invasion
as epileptic discharges often appeared from the peritumoral region [26-29]. It implies that the intracellular
communication exists between tumor cells and stroma
cells [30, 31].

treatment with Levetiracetam [27]. Besides, Maschio et al.
also found that Levetiracetam treatment reduced seizure
frequency by more than 50% in 72% of 19 patients [32]
and Newton et al. observed in 90% of 41 patients [36].
Other anti-epileptic drugs studied in patients with a brain
tumor are Valproic acid and Topiramate. 55.6% of seizure
freedom and 20% of seizure reduction (reduced seizure
frequency of more than 50%) were found in a cohort of 47
patients with a brain tumor after add-on and monotherapy
with Topiramate [37].
In considering which anti-epileptic drugs to select
for treatment of patients with TAE, it is essential for
physicians to weigh the benefit and potential harms. As a
beneficial aspect, using anti-epileptic drugs could reduce
the risk of first seizure or seizure recurrence and improve
the quality of life [38]. As a harmful or negative facet,
treatment with these drugs may cause related adverse
effects, drug-drug interactions and lastly also increase
financial burden. Anti-epileptic drugs often trigger a broad
range of side effects, such as liver dysfunction and skin
rash [39]. Aguiar et al. found that the patients with brain
tumor were more vulnerable to the adverse reactions of
anti-epileptic drugs than other epileptic patients [40].
During radiotherapy, patients receiving monotherapy
with Oxcarbazepine had a higher risk of skin rash such as
Stevens-Johnson syndrome [41]. Additionally, phenytoin
treatment could also cause 14%-27% of rash in patients

Treatment of TAE
Currently, the traditional anti-epileptic drugs have
been employed for the treatment of TAE. These drugs
exert anti-epileptic potential via multiple targets. Table
1 displayed the putative mechanism of the common
anti-epileptic drugs and the potential therapy for the
treatment of TAE. In general, there are two major types
of anti-epileptic drugs: first generation drugs (including
Valproic acid, Carbamazepine and Phenytoin) and second
generation drugs (including Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine
and Topiramate) [32, 33]. These drugs have multiple
mechanisms of action. For instance, Valproic acid exerts
anti-epileptic potential via inhibiting voltage-gated sodium
channels and enhancing GABAergic inhibition [34, 35].
The efficacy of traditional anti-epileptic drugs has been
studied previously. In a prospective analysis of 26 patients
with the primary brain tumor, seizures were significantly
decreased by more than 50% in 65% of the patients after

Tumor-stroma cross-talk in TAE

with brain tumors [16]. Cognitive deficits were also
reported in many patients with brain tumors and might be
more common in first generation anti-epileptic drugs such
as Phenytoin, Carbamazipine and Valproic acid than the
second generation drugs [42, 43]. Indeed, the results of
Klein et al. revealed that low-grade glioma patients who
used antiepileptic drugs exhibited worse cognitive tests
than patients who did not use antiepileptic drugs [44].
Recent investigations have demonstrated that some antiepileptic drugs generate pharmacokinetic interactions. In
addition, Valproic acid was previously found to enhance
chemotherapeutic effects in patients with glioblastoma due
to its histone deacetylase-inhibiting properties [45].
Glioma patients often undergo chemotherapy during
their disease course. Temozolomide was considered as
the first-line reagent for treating patients with low-grade
and high-grade gliomas [7, 46]. In a group of 30 patients
with low-grade gliomas during chemotherapy with
temozolomide, 54% of epileptic patients had a reduced
seizure frequency and 21% became seizure free, implying
that quality of life of these patients was greatly improved
after temozolomide treatment [47]. The improvement of
TAE after treatment with temozolomide was also verified
by Pace et al. [48].

The critical roles of tumor microenvironment
(TME) on tumorigenesis and tumor progression have
been emphasized for many years in multiple types of
cancers, including brain tumors [49-54]. Specifically,
it was previously illustrated that autocrine factors such
as transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) and heparinbinding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) secreted
by glioma cells could diffuse through the peri-tumoral
stroma and consequently influenced parenchymal cells
surrounding the tumor mass [50]. Conversely, normal
brain parenchymal cells such as microglia could secret
EGF and bind the corresponding receptor EGFR on the
glioma cells, providing a permissive microenvironment for
malignant glioma progression. Astrocyte-specific deletion
of PTEN-targeting microRNAs or blockade of astrocyte
exosome secretion suppressed metastasis formation
of brain tumor cells [55]. These findings imply that the
factors in TME have the capacity to promote tumor
progression to some extent. Several types of cells are
involved in brain TME, as shown in Figure 1. Typically,
they comprise brain tumor cells, astrocytes, microglia,
oligodendrocytes, neurons, neuronal progenitors,
macrophages, pericytes, endothelial cells and extracellular
matrix. In fact, there exists an interaction between brain

It is shown that there exists an interaction between brain tumor cell and astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte and macrophage. In the dotted

tumor cell and astrocyte, microglia, oligodendrocyte and
macrophage. Recent investigations indicate that glutamate,
a well-known excitatory neurotransmitter, is released by
glioma cells and causes high extracellular glutamate levels
in tumor environment, resulting in neuronal excitotoxicity
and the occurrence of TAE [56, 57]. Excessive production
of glutamate concentrations in glioma microenvironment
is correlated with reduced expression of excitatory amino
acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) and increased system xccystine/ glutamate transporter (SXC) expression [58].
In fact, a preclinical trial reveals that blockade of SXC
by sulfasalazine can remarkably diminish extracellular
glutamate content and alleviate epileptic seizures in tumorbearing mice [57]. These findings imply the central role
of the interaction between brain tumor cells and stromas
in tumor microenvironment in the etiology of TAE.
Intercellular communication is another important facet
of tumor-stroma crosstalk. As one of the most important
cellular communications, gap junctions were found to
exist between tumor cells and stroma cells, finally altering

the function of tumor cells [59]. In details, it is shown
that functional glioma-glioma gap junctions inhibit glioma
invasion while glioma-astrocyte and astrocyte-astrocyte
cellular communications promote it in an in vitro transwell
invasion assay. What is more important, gap junctions are
regarded as a crucial contributor of epileptic seizures [60].
In a genetic model of absence epilepsy, it was observed
that epileptic activity was significantly suppressed after
treating with carbenoxolone, a gap junction blocker
[61]. Collectively, it is summarized that there exists two
possible modes that participate in TAE, namely longrange and short-range modes (Figure 2). The long-range
mode refers to as factors released by tumors including
glutamate, binding to the corresponding receptor on the
cellular membrane and causing neuronal hyperactivity,
while the short-range mode is considered to involve
direct intracellular communication such as gap junctions
between tumor cells and stromas.

Figure 2: Proposed long-range mode and short-range mode in tumor associated epilepsy. We hypothesize that there exists
two modes contributing to TAE. One is the long-range mode which indicates that tumor cell released the Glu, Ca2+ and etc, causing
neuronal hyperexcitation (as shown in the right part of this figure) and in turn brings out epileptic seizures. The other is the short-range
mode which shows that tumor cell interconnects with astrocyte (marked by yellow starriness) or microglia (green starriness-like form) via
connectivity such as gap junction (as shown in the left part of this figure) and subsequently activate astrocyte or microglia, finally causing
neuronal hyperexcitability and triggering seizures.

The long-range mode in TAE:
the glutamate release from
glioma cells caused neuronal
hyperexcitability

GABAAR-induced fast-hyperpolarizing inhibition relies
upon the low intracellular concentration of chloride.
The potassium chloride cotransporter 2 (KCC2) is the
neuron-specific member of the SLC12A family of cationchloride cotransporters, which mainly extrudes neuronal
chloride in adult central nervous system [69, 70]. Previous
investigations elucidated that KCC2 was in charge of an
inwardly directed electrochemical gradient of chloride
and subsequently generated GABAA receptor-induced
hyperpolarizing inhibitory responses in adult brain [71,
72]. Indeed, it was previously found that KCC2 could
prevent neuronal hyperexcitation in mouse hippocampus
[73]. In contrast, KCC2 knockout or deficiency
contributed to the development of epilepsy in flies or
mice [74]. It is plausible that decreased function of KCC2
can convert GABA to an excitatory neurotransmitter and
generate depolarizing GABAergic responses. In a mouse
glioma model with peritumoral epilepsy, impaired KCC2
expression was found to induce depolarizing GABA
responses due to altered chloride homeostasis [65]. It
implies that peritumoral Glu concentration is necessary
but not sufficient for TAE and inhibition triggered by
GABA is also a central contributor of neuronal excitation.

Glutamate is regarded as the most important
excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Recently, this
excitatory amino acid has been involved in the etiology of
glioma. Indeed, the results of the previous microdialysis
study revealed the marked elevation of peritumoral
glutamate contents in glioma patients (nearly 100 fold
higher than levels in uninvolved brain) [62]. This increase
in peritumoral glutamate concentration triggers neuronal
hyperexcitability, finally leading to tumor-associated
seizures [57, 58]. Ye et al. reported that the glutamate
release from glioma cells might be ascribed to the
activity of SXC, responsible for the cellular synthesis
of glutathione (GSH) [56, 63]. Prior work revealed that
SXC was highly expressed in 190 glioma patients and
the elevated SXC expression was correlated with the
occurrence of tumor-related epilepsy [58]. Additionally,
the blockade of SXC by sulfasalazine, one U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)-approved SXC inhibitor, was
shown to inhibit glutamate release and epileptic seizures
[57]. SLC7A11, the catalytic subunit responsible for
SXC-induced glutamate release, was also found to be
greatly elevated in glioma patients with epileptic activity
[64]. And compared with tumors lacking SLC7A11,
intracranially implanted SLC7A11-expressing tumors
could trigger evident glutamate excitotoxicity and induced
seizures [64]. These findings hint that SXC is responsible
for releasing glutamate from gliomas and SLC7A11
expression is positively correlated with tumor-associated
seizures.

The SHORT-range mode in TAE:
alteration of gap junction is
of vital importance to tumorstroma crosstalk
The intracellular communication via gap junctions
represents an important pathway to promote cell
growth and differentiation [59, 75-77]. Additionally, the
intracellular coupling via gap junctions also activates Ca2+
signaling in glial cells, which in turn enhances neuronal
activity at a distance [78, 79]. Gap junctions are formed
by the docking of intracellular channels, each consisting in
hexameric arrangements of intrinsic membrane proteins,
connexins (CXs) and each six connexins compose one
connexon. The expression of CX is cell-type dependent.
Neurons (CX43, CX32, CX36), oligodendrocytes (CX32,
CX47, CX29), astrocytes (CX43, CX30, CX26) and
microglia (CX43, CX36, CX32) express different CXs
in the brain [80]. A previous investigation illustrated that
CX43 was abundantly expressed in reactive astrocytes
surrounding glioma [81], suggesting CX43-induced
alteration of gap junctions were involved in the tumorstroma crosstalk. Besides, previous studies supported
the notion that increased glial gap junction coupling
was associated with occurrence of epilepsy [82, 83].
Up-regulation of astrocytic CX43 might exacerbate
generalized seizures in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy
[84]. In addition, blockade of neuronal CX36 channels
by Quinine was found to significantly prevent epileptic
seizures in experimental animal models [85, 86]. A recent
investigation depicted that treatment with a traditional anti-

The long-range mode in TAE:
loss of GABAergic interneurons
and depolarizing GABAergic
responses
To some extent, it is also important for GABAergic
interneurons to maintain the excitation-inhibition
balance in the brain [65]. Loss of GABAergic synaptic
transmission was previously found to result in neuronal
hyperexcitability, finally causing epileptic seizures [66,
67]. L. Campbell et al. disclosed that the marked reduction
of peritumoal parvalbumin-positive GABAergic inhibitory
interneurons was observed in a mouse glioma model with
seizures, accompanied with the deficiency in spontaneous
and evoked inhibitory neurotransmission [65]. GABAinduced inhibitory responses are largely activated by
A type GABA receptors (GABAARs) [67]. As is known
to all, GABAARs are ligand-gated chloride-permeable
ion channels assembled from a diversity of polypeptide
subtypes (α1-α6, β1-β3, γ1-γ3, δ ε, π, θ, ρ1-ρ3) [68].

epileptic drug, namely, Valproic acid, remarkably reduced
seizure frequency and duration in patients with GBM [87].
As a classical chemotherapeutic agent, Temozolomide
was also reported to improve seizure control in glioma
patients [84]. And in glioblastoma cells, inhibition of
CX43 by a selective blocker called the C-terminal peptide
mimetic αCT1, could enhance therapeutic responses in
Temozolomide-resistant cancers [88]. It suggests that
Temozolomide may alleviate TAE via enhancing gap
junctions. Further experimental investigations are essential
to verify this speculation.
The direct cellular interconnection can be also
performed by tunneling nanotube network (TNN). The
TNN was a newly discovered tubular structure between
two cells in 2004 [89] and has been found in multiple types
of cells, such as rat astrocytes and neurons [90], PC12 cells
[91] and mouse macrophage J774 cells [92]. Recently,
Zhang et al. found that the tunneling nanotube was formed
between rat primary astrocytes and C6 glioma cells [93].
Established tunneling nanotubes between astrocytes and
glioma cells significantly inhibited the proliferation of
glioma cells. We speculate that the generation of tumorrelated seizures may be linked with the tunneling nanotube
between glioma cells and human astrocytes.

In summary, it was for the first time to propose that
there exist two major molecular mechanisms, namely,
long-range mode and short-range mode, underlying
TAE. As mentioned above, glutamate released by
tumor cells could alter the biological behaviors of
astrocytes and cause neuronal hyperexcitability, finally
initiating human epilepsy. However, inhibition of
glutamate release generates serious side effects. The
other possible mechanisms called short-range mode
(cellular interconnection) attract our attention. Further
investigations of gap junctions and tunneling nanotube
network between tumor and stromas may find a novel
effectively therapeutic target for the treating TAE.

Perspectives

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Epilepsy is very common in patients with brain
tumors and often not successfully treated after surgical
resection. The etiology of TAE is not well understood,
but the tumor-induced cellular/molecular alterations
which contribute to the changes of surrounding stromas,
finally leading to the functional connectivity (Figure 1).
We propose two modes are likely to be involved in TAE
(Figure 2).
One mode is performed via paracrine mechanisms,
namely, secreting neurotransmitters, microvesicles or
exosomes by tumor cells and subsequently causing
neuronal hyperexcitability and seizures. We consider
this mode as a long-range effect on neurons. Indeed, a
previous investigation illustrated that glioma-released
glutamate had a high risk of seizures in patients [58].
MicroRNA-451/microRNA-21 in extracellular vesicles
released from primary human glioblastoma cells were
also found to be transferred to microglial and result in the
marked reduction of microRNA-451/microRNA-21 target
c-Myc mRNA [94].
The other mode refers to the direct cellular
communication between tumor cells and adjacent stromas
in the microenvironment, which is called short-range
mode. In fact, it was reported that brain tumors could
interconnect and build a functional network via microtubeassociated gap junctions and TNN [89]. We speculate that
altered gap junctions and TNN exist between tumor cells
and adjacent astrocytes, and these changes may induce
tumor-associated epileptic seizures.
