ABSTRACT
Farnesyltransferase has been regarded as a promising drug target against cancer
as it is critical for membrane association of several signal transduction proteins. In
this study, a novel farnesyltransferase inhibitor (IMB-1406) was identified through
virtual screening. It exhibits stronger potency (IC50s: 6.92–8.99 μM) than Sunitinib
against all of the tested cancer cell lines. Preliminary studies on mechanism reveal
that IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the S
phase, altering anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction
and activation of caspase-3. This anti-tumor effect is most probably related to the
inhibition of farnesyltransferase as indicated by molecular docking. Overall, IMB1406 is a novel lead compound with potent antitumor activity and deserves further
structural modifications.

INTRODUCTION

of these signal transduction pathways through mutation of
the Ras genes involved in many tumor types [3].
Farnesylation is a type of lipid modification
called protein prenylation that is critical for biological
functionality, including membrane association of several
signal transduction proteins. Oncogenically mutant forms
of human Ras superfamily proteins are associated with
30% of all human cancers; the transforming ability of
these mutants is dependent upon farnesylation. More
recently, farnesyltransferase has become popular drug
targets [4, 5]. Inhibitors of farnesyltransferase cause tumor
regression in animals and are currently being evaluated
in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers
[6–8]. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) that have
been or are being investigated in clinical trials include
lonafarnib (SCH66336; SarasarTM; Schering-Plough),
tipifarnib (R115777; ZarnestraTM; Ortho BiotechProducts),
L778123 (Merck), BMS-214662 (Bristol-MyersSquibb),
and salirasib (S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalycilic acid,
FTS, Concordia Pharmaceuticals) [9]. However, none

Cancers still remain the second leading cause of
death worldwide after cardiovascular diseases [1]. Many
classes of antitumor agents, especially tyrosine kinase
(TK) inhibitors, have been introduced to the market
during the last decade, and more candidates are now
under development [2]. However, given the emergence
of drug resistance and the low success rate in clinical
development, the discovery of novel chemical compounds
with a completely new mode of action is clearly needed.
The Ras genes encode more than 100 proteins,
collectively known as the Ras superfamily, which are
involved in the regulation of proliferation, differentiation,
cell adhesion and apoptosis of cells. Some of these proteins
are small G proteins that transducer signals from cellsurface receptors, such as growth factor receptors, and then
transmit the signals to several different pathways, ultimately
affect mitogenic functions such as DNA synthesis,
cytoskeletal organization and lipid metabolism. Disruption

of these have yet been approved by FDA for clinical
treatments. Therefore, it is imperative to develop more
new FTIs.
Computer-aided drug design is one of most effective
methods in developing new drugs. Many reports have
indicated that computational method is a time-saving
and effort-saving approach to discover new candidates
including molecular docking [10], virtual screening
[11], and 3DQSAR [12, 13]. Virtual screening (VS)
has emerged as a powerful approach to complement the
array of existing high-throughput screening technologies
[14, 15]. Using computer-aided VS, potential leads can be
rapidly identified in silico in order to narrow the range of
molecules to be tested in vitro and in vivo. In this study,
virtual screening was used as a 3D query in an in-house
chemical database over 900 compounds screening to
retrieve potential FTIs.

suggesting that IMB-1406 could have similar affinity with
the Compound 4 and the farnesyltransferase might be one
of the possible targets for IMB-1406.

Chemical synthesis
Detailed synthetic pathway to compound
IMB-1406 is depicted in Scheme 1. Treatment of ethambutol
(EMB, 1) with tert-butyldimethylsilyl chloride (TBDMSCl)
gave the desired bis-TBDMS-protected compound 2. The
coupling of the resulting diamine 2 with intermediate 3
(22) and then deprotection of the hydroxyl groups with
tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) yielded the target compound IMB-1406 (Scheme 1).

Antitumor activity
For preliminary screening of antitumor activity, IMB1406 was first investigated for cytotoxic activity against
A549 (lung adenocarcinoma), MCF-7 (breast cancer),
DU145 (prostate carcinoma) and HepG2 (liver carcinoma).
Then the compound was further evaluated for its in vitro
anti-tumor activity against the aforementioned four human
cancer cell lines by the MTT assay. The inhibition rate and
IC50 values were compared with those of Sunitinib, a multitargeted receptor TK inhibitor [24] (Table 1). IMB-1406
exhibits remarkable anti-tumor activity (inhibition rate:
99.93%–100.39%, IC50s: 6.92–8.99 μM) which is better
than Sunitinib (inhibition rate: 86.51%–100.02%, IC50s:
7.60–10.36 μM) against these cancer cell lines, and thus is
selected as the lead compound for preliminary mechanism
study on the growth inhibition of HepG2 cells.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Virtual screening
Virtual screening of chemical databases can serve
the purpose of finding novel potential leads suitable for
further development. Molecular docking technology which
has been increasingly used in the course of drug research
and development is the representative of receptor-based
virtual screening [16, 17]. In this paper, molecular docking
experiments were carried out using Discovery Studio 2.5
software (Accelrys Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) with fully
automated docking tool using “CDOCKER” protocol
[18–22] employing CHARMm force field to investigate
the possible inhibitors for farnesyltransferase. The
CDOCKER energy (-(protein-ligand interaction
energies)) of best poses docked into the receptor of all the
900 compounds was calculated and compared with that
of Compound 4 which is a new potent farnesyltransferase
inhibitor based on the ethylenediamine scaffold. As
a result, IMB-1406 was found to have the highest
CDOCKER energy and similar structural framework
to the crystallized inhibitor (Compound 4) [23] of
farnesyltransferase, as shown in Figure 1.
According to the docking result, the most active
compound IMB-1406 and the Compound 4 are found to
bind in the active pocket of farnesyltransferase receptor in a
similar conformation (Figure 2). As described above, both
the para-benzonitrile moiety of the Compound 4 and the
6-bromo-2-methoxyquinoline one of IMB-1406 are oriented
toward the product exit groove and are partially stabilized
by a stacking interaction with Y361β. In Figure 2B, there are
three hydrogen bonding interactions between the N22 and
O33 positions of IMB-1406 and R202β. This is consistent
with the -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY between
the two compounds and the farnesyltransferase. The
highest -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY was
52.24 for IMB-1406 and that of Compound 4 was 57.22,

Effects of IMB-1406 on cell cycle of HepG2 cells
To understand the mechanisms underlying the action
of IMB-1406, the effects of IMB-1406 on HepG2 cell
cycle were examined. HepG2 cells were treated with the
indicated concentrations of IMB-1406 for 72 h and stained
with propidium iodide (PI), followed by flow cytometry
analysis. As shown in Figure 3, the percentages of HepG2
cells in the S phase are 28.17% (2 μM), 36.96% (4 μM)
and 37.25% (8 μM), respectively, which are significantly
higher than that of the vehicle treated controls (26.43%).
Hence, IMB-1406 inhibits the growth of the cancer cells
by inhibiting the cell cycle via S-phase arrest.

Effects of IMB-1406 on induction of HepG2 cell
apoptosis
Apoptosis plays a central role in cancer treatment,
since its induction in cancer cells is critical to a successful
therapy [25, 26]. It is thus believed that apoptosis assay
may provide important information to the preliminary
investigation of the mode of action. The impact of IMB1406 on the apoptosis of HepG2 cells was examined

to 17.15% (2 μM), 35.40% (4 μM) or 57.51% (8 μM),

assessed. The uptake of 5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro -1,1′,3,3′tetraethylbenzimidazol-carbocyanine
iodide
(JC-1),
a lipophilic cationic fluorescent dye accumulated in
mitochondria, is positively correlated with the mitochondrial
membrane potential [27]. HepG2 cells were treated with
different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 8 μM) of IMB-1406 for
72 h prior to staining with JC-1. Then the numbers of
cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane potential in
different cell groups were determined by flow cytometric
analysis. As shown in Figure 5, the percentage of cells with
typical apoptotic morphology increases in a dose-dependent
fashion (0.53%, 6.14%, 13.8% and 34.92%, respectively).
Our results reveal that incubation with IMB-1406 increases
the number of cells with collapsed mitochondrial membrane
potentials and induces apoptosis.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Effects of IMB-1406 on the levels of Bax, Bcl-2
and caspase-3

Virtual screening

Mitochondria play an essential role in cell death
signal transduction. The mitochondria-dependent apoptotic
pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of pro- and antiapoptotic proteins, which induce the permeabilization
of the mitochondrial outer membrane, resulting in the
activation of the caspase cascade and the induction of
apoptotic cell death [28, 29]. To explore the possible
role of a mitochondrial-related pathway in IMB-1406induced apoptosis, the effects of IMB-1406 on the levels
of Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were examined by Western
blot analysis. As shown in Figure 6, IMB-1406 treatment
shows concentration-dependent effects in upregulating the
expressions of Bax and downregulating Bcl-2. In addition,
caspase-3 is activated in a concentration-dependent
manner after treatment with IMB-1406 at 2 μM, 4 μM and
8 μM for 72 h. These results reveal that IMB-1406 induces
apoptosis in HepG2 cancer cells via a mitochondriadependent pathway.

The
representative
crystal
structure
of
farnesyltransferase (PDB ID 3E30) was obtained from the
Protein DataBank. Initially there was a pretreatment process
for both the ligands and the enzymes. For ligand preparation,
all the duplicate structures were removed and options for
ionization change, tautomer generation, isomer generation,
Lipinski filter and 3D generator were set true. For enzyme
preparation, the whole enzyme was selected, waters were
removed and hydrogen atoms were added to it. The pH of
theprotein was set in the range of 6.5 to 8.5. Then we defined
the enzyme as a total receptor and the binding site was
defined by selecting the important amino acids for catalysis
to generate a 10 Å radius sphere by the operation of Define
and Edit Binding Site. Docking of compounds into enzymes
with CDOCKER was done using the default parameters. The
pose with the top -CDOCKER_INTERACTION_ENERGY
was chosen for analyzing the binding features.

cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM, Invitrogen) containing 10% calf serum (CS) and
grown in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

All the reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and were used without further purification unless
otherwise indicated. Reaction courses were monitored by
TLC on silica gel precoated F254 Merck plates. Developed
plates were examined with UV lamps (254 nm). 1H-NMR
and 13C-NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker spectrometer
using TMS as the internal standard. DMSO-d6 and CDCl3
were used as the solvent. Mass spectra were measured on
an Agilent 1100 series.

Reagents
The Annexin V- APC/7-AAD Apoptosis Detection
kit, Cell cycle detection kit, Mitochondrial membrane
potential detection kit, SDS-PAGE gel preparation kit
and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) kit were
purchased from Nanjing KeyGen Biotech Co., Ltd.
(Nanjing, China). DMSO and MTT were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).
Other reagents were purchased from Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology (Jiangsu, China).

General procedure for the synthesis of
intermediate 2
To a solution of ethambutol dihydrochloride
(1, 2.77g, 10 mmol) and Et3N (5.70 ml, 44 mmol) in
anhydrous DCM (100ml) was added dropwise a solution
of tert-butyldimthylsilyl chloride (3.30 g, 22 mmol) in
anhydrous DCM (20 ml) at 0°C. After the addition, the
mixture was stirred at room temperature for 2 h and then
washed with water (150 ml), satd. NaHCO3 (100 ml) and
brine (100 ml). The organic fractions were dried over
anhydrous magnesium sulfate. The solvent was removed
in vacuo to yield 2 (4.72 g, 80.5%) as a colourless oil.

MTT assay
Cell growth inhibition was determined using a
colorimetric MTT assay. The assay was conducted in a
96-well plate with a cell density of 8 × 103 cells per well
with an incubation period of 24 h. The cells were then
incubated with different concentrations of IMB-1406 (0,
20, 40, 80, 160 and 320 mg/l) in triplicate. After 24, 48 and
72 h of incubation, the cells were incubated with medium
containing MTT for 4 h, and the formazan crystals were
dissolved with 150 µl DMSO. The dark blue MTT crystals
were dissolved by agitating the plates at room temperature
for 10 min, and the absorbance was then measured at
490 nm with a microplate reader (OLYMPUS IX51, Japan).

General procedure for the synthesis of
intermediate 4
Anhydrous potassium carbonate (0.83 g, 3 mmol)
was added to a solution of 2 (1.30 g, 3 mmol) and 3
(200 mg, 0.5 mmol) in acetonitrile (10ml). The resulting
mixture was reflux for overnight, after which the reaction
mixture was poured into water (20 ml), and extracted
with DCM (3 × 20 ml). The combined organic extracts
were washed with satd. NaHCO3 (2 × 30 ml) and brine
(30 ml), dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate and
solvents removed in vacuo to obtain the crude reaction
mixture. Further purification was performed by silica flash
column chromatography eluting with DCM/MeOH (95:5),
affording 4 as a light yellow oil (0.26 g, 69.5%).

Apoptosis detection assay
HepG2 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and
treated with IMB-1406 at different concentrations for 72 h.
Apoptosis was then detected by the following procedures.

Flow cytometry analysis of Annexin V-APC/7AAD staining
HepG2 cells were inoculated in 6-well plates and
then processed accordingly after they adhered. Cells
were treated with IMB-1406, after 72 h the cells were
collected by trypsin without EDTA, washed twice with
PBS. The Annexin V-APC/7-AAD Apoptosis Detection
kit (KGA1024, KeyGEN, Nanjing, China) was used for
cell staining and flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson FACS
Calibur) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The
percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using FACS
flow cytometry and associated software (BECKMAN).
Experiments were repeated three times, and the results are
displayed as histograms.

General procedure for the synthesis of IMB-1406
The solution of compound 4 (0.28 g, 0.37 mmol) in
THF (5 ml) and 1M TBAF (in THF, 1.37 ml, 1.48 mmol)
were allowed to react at room temperature for 10h, then
the reaction mixture was concentrated and purified silica
flash column chromatography (0–10% (v/v) MeOH in
DCM). The collected fraction were evaporated to afford
the alcohol IMB-1406 as a white solid (90.2 mg, 45.9%).

In summary, a new compound (IMB-1406) was
identified, synthesized and characterized by 1HNMR,
13
CNMR and MS. IMB-1406 was found to have
considerable potency (IC50s: 6.92–8.99 μM) which is better
than Sunitinib against all four cancer cell lines tested.
Moreover, preliminary study on mechanism revealed that
IMB-1406 induces apoptosis in HepG2 cells by arresting
the cell cycle at the S phase, altering anti- and proapoptotic proteins leading to mitochondrial dysfunction
and activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, molecular docking
study suggested one of the possible targets for IMB-1406
was protein farnesyltransferase. Together, IMB-1406 is a
novel conjugate with potent antitumor activity, and it could
contribute to a better understanding of structure-based
drug design to facilitate drug discovery. Based on this,
further structural modifications, SAR studies and enzyme
inhibitory activity of IMB-1406 are currently in progress.
