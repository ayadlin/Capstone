ABSTRACT
The purpose of this study is to identify protein kinase genes that modulate
oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in vitro and evaluate the roles of these genes in predicting
clinical outcomes in CRC patients receiving oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy.
A high-throughput RNAi screening targeting 626 human kinase genes was performed
to identify kinase genes whose inhibition potentiates oxaliplatin sensitivity in CRC
cells. The associations between copy numbers of the candidate genes and recurrencefree survival and overall survival were analyzed in 142 stage III CRC patients
receiving first-line oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy who were enrolled from
two independent hospitals. HT-RNAi screening identified 40 kinase genes whose
inhibition potentiated oxaliplatin cytotoxicity in DLD1 cells. The relative copy number
(RCN) of MAP4K1 and CDKL4 were associated with increased risks of both recurrence
and death. Moreover, significant genes-based risk score and the ratios of RCN of
different genes can further categorize patients into subgroups with distinctly differing
outcomes. The estimated AUC for the prediction models including clinical variables
plus kinase biomarkers was 0.77 for the recurrence and 0.82 for the survival models.
The copy numbers of MAP4K1 and CDKL4 can predict clinical outcomes in CRC patients
treated with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

with high risk stage II and stage III patients after curative
resection according to the National Comprehensive Cancer
Network (NCCN) Guidelines. The results from MOSAIC
and NSABP C-07 clinical trial led to the approval of
oxaliplatin-based regimens as the first-line chemotherapy
in the adjuvant setting [3, 5]. However, three-year diseasefree survival (DFS) continues to be 65% in patients
with stage III CRC receiving oxaliplatin-containing
adjuvant chemotherapy [6]. To identify genes involved
in modulating oxaliplatin response would be instrumental

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
malignancies and the second leading cause of cancer
death worldwide [1]. The clinical outcome of CRC has
significantly improved over recent decades, which can
be attributed to improved surgical techniques in early
disease, adjuvant therapy for locally advanced disease,
and multimodality therapy for metastatic disease [2-4].

in improving the efficacy of adjuvant oxaliplatin–based
chemotherapy and predicting which patients are most or
least likely to benefit from such treatment. To date, no
predictive markers of oxaliplatin sensitivity and resistance
have been clinically validated.
With the advent of high-throughput RNA
interference (HT-RNAi) screen-based on large-scale gene
knockdown, it has become feasible to quickly screen and
validate drug modulators whose suppression can overcome
resistance to chemotherapeutic agents [7]. Such studies
can not only provide important insight into the mechanism
of drug resistance, but also identify novel drug targets
and potential combination strategies for more effective
chemotherapy, and identify promising candidates to serve
as biomarkers for drug response and patient stratification
[8]. A number of studies utilizing HT-RNAi screen have
characterized key genes contributing to the resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents in patients with breast, ovarian,
and other cancers [9, 10]. However, there was only one
published study using HT-RNAi screen-based approach to
identify modulators of oxaliplatin resistance in CRC cell
lines that revealed the involvement of TP53 in oxaliplatin
response [11].
Protein kinases function as key regulators of cell
proliferation, differentiation and survival through the
process of phosphorylation. Protein kinases are believed
to play an important role in chemoresistance based on
the evidence that inhibition of kinases often enhances
sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents
including cisplatin and doxorubicin [12]. Aberrant
activation of kinases was frequently observed in tumors
due to somatic genome aberrations including mutations
and copy number variations (CNVs). Increased copy
number of aurora kinase A was associated with prognosis
and response to oxaliplatin–based chemotherapy in
patients with metastatic CRC [13]. However, there has
not been any study published using HT-RNAi screening
of the kinome to identify modulators of oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy response in locally advanced CRC. We
hypothesize that CNVs of kinases are potential predictors

of oxaliplatin efficacy in the adjuvant setting. To test this
hypothesis, we first employed HT-RNAi screening using
a lentiviral short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library against
human kinome to identify potentiators of oxaliplatin
response in cultured CRC cell lines. Subsequently, we
used two independent CRC patient cohorts to validate
the association between CNVs of “hit” genes and clinical
outcomes of stage III CRC receiving oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy.

RESULTS
High-throughput RNAi screening for kinase genes
modulating oxaliplatin response
We performed HT-RNAi screen using a lentiviral
shRNA library that targets 626 human kinase genes.
Both statistics and sensitivity parameters were used for
selection of “hits” [9, 14]. Only lentiviral shRNA fulfilling
the requirements of Z-score < -1.65 (equal to P < 0.05,
the standard of statistical significance) and SI>0.15
(standard for sensitizing) were identified as hits. The
preliminary screening, as shown in Table 1, Figure 1 and
Supplementary Table 1, yielded 40 (6.4%) genes whose
inhibition by shRNA potentiated DLD1 cell sensitivity to
oxaliplatin, suggesting the involvement of these genes in
oxaliplatin resistance.
To further explore the underlying mechanism of
oxaliplatin resistance, we performed a pathway analysis of
the 40 hits through the DAVID (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.
gov/) analysis tool. Several cancer-related pathways were
identified. Under a stringent criterion of P < 0.01, the
VEGF and ERBB signaling pathways were enriched with
four key genes comprising PTK2, MAP2K1, PIK3CA and
PRKCB.

carried out. The calculated z score corresponding to each target gene was dotted and target genes with z score <-1.65 and SI>0.1 were
selected as hits and showed in red solid circles.

and Table 2).
The significant associations between MAP4K1 and
the risks of recurrence and death were confirmed in the
replication set and pooled analysis (Supplementary Table
3 and 4). Patients with higher RCN of MAP4K1 showed
increased risks of recurrence (HR 1.16; 95% CI, 1.011.32; P=0.04) and death (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.38;
P=0.01) in the replication set. The combined HR was
1.14 (95% CI, 1.06 to1.22; P=0.0002) for recurrence and
1.11 (95%CI, 1.05-1.18; P=0.0005) for death. Although
CDKL4 exhibited similar risk estimate with recurrence in
the validation set, the association did not reach statistical
significance. However, the increased risk of death
associated with higher RCN of CDKL4 was confirmed in
the replication set (HR 1.53; 95%CI, 1.06-2.19, P=0.02)
and combined dataset (HR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.03-1.28,
P=0.01).

We then used two independent cohorts of
CRC patients receiving adjuvant oxalilplatin-based
chemotherapy to evaluate whether the in vitro HT-RNAi
screen-identified kinase genes are involved in oxaliplatin
response in patients. Supplementary Table 2 shows the
clinical characteristics of the training and validation
patient cohorts. Of the 76 patients in the training set, the
median age was 60 years (range, 24–79 years). The median
follow-up time was 57 months. There were 19 recurrences
(25%) and 28 deaths (36.8%), but the median RFS and OS
had not been reached during the follow-up time. Among
the 66 patients in the replication set, 19 patients (28.8%)
had recurrence and 15 (22.7%) were dead. There was no
significant difference between the training and validation
sets with regard to age, gender, histological grade and
stage.
We assessed the association of the RCN of each hit
gene with recurrence and survival using a multivariate Cox
model, adjusting for age, gender, tumor site and histologic
grade. In the training set, a significantly increased risk
of recurrence was observed for those with higher RCN
of MAP4K1 (HR 1.15, 95%CI, 1.05-1.26; P=0.002)
and CDKL4 (HR, 1.20, 95%CI, 1.02-1.40; P=0.02)
(Supplementary Table 3 and Table 2). Higher RCN of
three genes exhibited significantly increased risk of death:
MAP4K1 (HR 1.11; 95%CI, 1.03 -1.19; P=0.01), DOLK
(HR 1.19; 95%CI, 1.00 -1.41; P=0.04) and CDKL4 (HR
1.14; 95%CI, 1.00-1.29; P=0.05) (Supplementary Table 4

The association between RCN-based risk score
and overall survival
To further evaluate the predictive value of
MAP4K1 and CDKL4 in survival, we performed a risk
score analysis. Joint analysis of MAP4K1 and CDKL4
dichotomized the 142 patients into low-risk and high-risk
group for death using the cutoff (0.45) of the risk score
threshold value. The high-risk group had a 2.70-fold
(95% CI, 1.37-5.33) increased risk and had a significantly
shorter median survival time compared with the low-risk
group (log-rank P=0.04) (Figure 2).

The association between copy number ratios of hit
genes and clinical outcomes

ROC model for evaluating the prediction ability
of clinical outcome

Since two-gene ratios have been used to evaluate
cancer prognosis and provided improved risk prediction
in breast cancer [15], we performed similar analyses.
The RCN of each hit gene was compared to the RCN of
the other 39 hit genes, which produced 780 ratios with
intragroup variance. To reduce false positives, the ratios
with intragroup variability below 10 (288 ratios) were
used for the analyses of clinical outcomes (Supplementary
Table 5). There were 29 ratios and 33 ratios significantly
associated with the risk of recurrence and death,
respectively (Supplementary Table 6, 7). Individual and
joint analysis of the ratios of PTK2/MAGI2 and CDKL4/
PTK2 showed a consistent association with the risk of
recurrence in the training set, replication set and combined
analysis (Supplementary Table 8). Joint analysis of these
two ratios could categorize patients into two subgroups.
Compared with the low-risk group, the high-risk group
had a 2.91-fold (95% CI, 1.49-5.69) increased risk of
recurrence. The median RFS time for the low-risk and
high-risk group was >94 months and 72 months (log-rank
P=0.0002), respectively (Figure 3). The ratios of PRKCD/
BMP2K, MST1R/WNK1, STK39/AGK, DYRK4/SGK3 and
CDKL4/CERKL were significantly associated with the risk
of death in the training set, replication set and combined
analysis (Supplementary Table 8). The joint analysis of
these 5 ratios showed that the high-risk group was at a
5.29-fold (95% CI 2.61–10.72) increased risk of death.
The median overall survival time for the low-risk and
high-risk group was >94 months and 41 months (log-rank
P=3.81×10-7), respectively (Figure 3).

To evaluate the discriminatory ability, we
constructed ROC and computed the AUC for risk
prediction models of recurrence and death. For the
prediction ability of recurrence, when we incorporated
clinical variables (age, sex, stage and histological grade),
effect of MAP4K1 and joint ratios of PTK2/MAGI2 and
CDKL4/PTK2, the AUC for all patients (n =142) was
0.77 (0.62-0.74). The sensitivity and specificity was 78%
and 65%, respectively. For survival prediction, the AUC
reached 0.82 (0.71-0.85), when we included clinical
variables, combined risk score of MAP4K1 and CDKL4,
and combined ratios of PRKCD/BMP2K, MST1R/WNK1,
STK39/AGK, DYRK4/SGK3 and CDKL4/CERKL in the
model. The sensitivity and specificity was 85% and 69%,
respectively (Figure 4).

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify
modulators of oxaliplatin response by a combination
of HT-RNAi functional screen of human kinases and
copy number analysis of human patient samples. In
this study, we found 40 kinase genes responsible for
oxaliplatin response through the kinome HT-RNAi
screen, 9 of which (22.5%) have been reported to be
involved in chemoresistance in other RNAi screens [7,
14]. Further, we found that high copy number of MAP4K1
showed consistent association with both recurrence
and survival for patients with stage III CRC patients
receiving oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, highlighting
the important role of MAP4K1 in modulating oxaliplatin

response and its potential as a biomarker for the efficacy
of oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy.
MAP4K1 exerts its biological function upon
extracellular stimulation by activating MAP3 kinases
which in turn phosphorylate JNK, leading to the activation
of MAPK pathway [16]. JNK has been reported in colon
and other cancer cells to sustain multidrug resistance
(MDR), and inhibition of JNK enhanced the apoptosis of
colon cancer cells treated with chemotherapy agents such
as nocodazole, camptothecin and 5-FU [17-19]. Enforced
MAP4K1 expression was also shown to stimulate NFκB
pathway which impeded apoptosis, resulting in resistance
to cytotoxic drugs in cancer cell lines [20, 21]. Therefore,
the function of MAP4K1 contributing to MDR and antiapoptosis would account for the observation that CRC
patients with high copy number of MAP4K1 had a worse
clinical outcome. This finding was also supported by
recent studies on another MAP4 kinase-MAP4K4, whose
high expression was found to be associated with poor
prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma [22, 23].
Our study also showed that a significant association
of CDKL4 with both recurrence and death. CDKL4
belongs to cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) family
responsible for cell cycle progression. In colon cancer
cells, CDK inhibitors were demonstrated to inhibit cell
proliferation and induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
[24]. Furthermore, inhibition of CDKs enhanced cell death
in response to chemotherapy through downregulation of
anti-apoptotic proteins including XIAP, BCL2, MCL-1 and
suppression of survivin phposphorylation [25]. In a phase
I study of CDK inhibitor (Flavopiridol) administered with
oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in platinum-refractory
germ cell tumors, 33% of patients showed a partial
response [26]. Consistent with this, our HT-RNAi screen
results showed increased colon cancer cell death after
targeting CDKL4 in the presence of oxaliplatin.

The present study also showed that the risk score
of MAP4K1 and CDKL4 could affect CRC overall
survival. Activated JNK driven by MAP4 kinases is able
to phosphorylate c-Jun, which subsequently promote gene
transcription responsible for G1/S and G2/M transition
[27, 28]. Therefore, MAP4K1 possibly coordinated
with CDKL4 to achieve cumulative effect on cell cycle
progression. We also evaluated the effect of copy
number ratios of hit genes on clinical outcomes. Among
them, MST1R/WNK1, STK39/AGK, DYRK4/SGK3 and
CDKL4/PTK2 have cumulative effect on overall survival.
Interestingly, all these hit genes have been implicated in
MAPK and PI3K signaling pathways. In vitro experiments
have demonstrated the complex interactions between
components of the PI3K and MAPK pathway, providing a
rationale for the combined inhibition of both pathways to
confer enhanced sensitivity to chemotherapeutics agents
[29].
When we incorporated all the potential predictive
markers revealed in this study into a multivariate model,
we obtained excellent prediction efficacy with an AUC
of 0.77 for recurrence and 0.82 for survival, highlighting
the importance of considering biomarkers in prediction
of clinical outcomes. The risk models to predict clinical
efficacy may allow clinicians to identify patients at high
risk of recurrence and survival before the start of therapy
and make better-informed clinical decisions and follow up
surveillance for patients.
Furthermore, a pathway analysis revealed that
the VEGF and ERBB signaling pathway genes were
enriched in modulating oxaliplatin response, suggesting
drugs targeting these two pathways may enhance the
sensitivity of CRC cells to oxaliplatin. Indeed, targeted
therapies by Avastin and Cetuximab have now been used
in combination with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy
to treat metastatic CRC [30, 31]. Finally, our study
uncovered several potential drug targets that may

overcome oxaliplatin resistance and improve therapy. This
is particularly significant as acquired resistance to Avastin
and Cetuximab ultimately takes place after a period of
usage.
In conclusion, using HT-RNAi screen followed
by patient cohort validation, we have identified several
plausible kinase genes that are associated with oxaliplatin
resistance in CRC cell lines. These genes are potential
drug targets to overcome oxiliplatin resistance and their
copy numbers may serve as biomarkers for clinical
outcomes in CRC patients receiving oxaliplatin-based
chemotherapy.

2x103 cells per well. The next day, medium was removed
and replaced with fresh medium supplemented with 8 µg/
ml polybrene (Sigma, United States), and then lentiviral
shRNAs were added to cells at a multiplicity of infection
(MOI) of 5 in triplicates. Equal amount of lentiviral
scramble shRNA was placed in each plate as a control
[32]. After 24 h, cells were treated with equal volume of
vehicle control (water) and 10 μM oxaliplatin (Sigma,
United States) solution; this concentration resulted in an
average of 40% cell growth inhibition and was close to
the plasma concentration in CRC in our previous study
[32]. At 48 h post-infection, cells were subjected to MTT
assay. Z-score and sensitivity index (SI) value were
utilized as the criteria for hits selection. The calculation of
Z score and SI were performed according to the protocols
described previously [9, 14]. The Z score and SI of
lentiviral shRNA-treated cells were normalized to those
of the scramble shRNA-treated cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
DLD1 was purchased from American Type Culture
Collection (ATCC, United States). 293FT was obtained
from life technologies (United States). DLD1 was cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS.
293FT cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 0.1mmol/L MEM non-essential amino
acids, 6 mmol L-glutamine, 1mmol/L sodium pyruvate
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 500μg/mL geneticin.

CRC patient cohort and data collection
142 histologically confirmed stage III colorectal
adenocarcinoma patients were recruited between June
2006 and December 2011, with follow-up to January
2014. Among them, 76 patients were recruited from RuiJin
Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University and
used as the training set, and 66 patients were enrolled from
The Tenth People’s Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Tongji
University and used as the validation set. All the patients
were newly diagnosed cases (diagnosed within 1 year of
enrollment) and none had undergone chemotherapy or
radiotherapy prior to study enrollment. All the patients
underwent radical resection and first-line oxaliplatin-based
adjuvant chemotherapy for at least of six cycles. Patients
were staged according to the American Joint Committee
on Cancer-tumor-node metastasis staging system (TNM).
We reviewed patients’ medical records to collect clinical
information including date of diagnosis, clinical stage,
tumor location, histological grade, pathological stage
and treatment. The information of recurrence/death was
obtained from the medical records or telephone follow-up.
Paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens were provided by
pathological departments. The study was approved by the
Human Research Ethics Committees of Shanghai Jiaotong
University and TongJi University.

Lentivial shRNA library construction
The shRNA sequences targeting 626 human kinase
genes (Supplementary Table 1) were generated using the
design tool from the Broad Institute RNAi Consortium
(http://www.broadinstitute.org/rnai/public/). Four pairs
of shRNA oligonucleotides for each gene were selected,
chemically-synthesized and then constructed into
pLvUCTP lentiviral vector which was modified from
FuGW as we previously described [32]. The library
construction method was modified from the protocol
described elsewhere [33]. Briefly, four lentiviral shRNA
vectors for each gene were prepared and mixed equally.
Transfections were carried out in 24-well plates by adding
the mixture of shRNA vectors, packaging plasmids and
FUGENE (Roche, Switzerland). Lentiviral supernatants
were harvested at 24, 48 and 60 h post-transfection and
purified by passaging into 0.45 μm filter (Millipore,
Germany). Collected lentiviruses were stored at -800C for
long storage.

DNA extraction from FFPE samples
Manual macrodissection of tumor samples were
performed according to the protocol described elsewhere
[34, 35]. 50-100 tissue sections (2 µm thick per each) were
sliced from each FFPE sample. Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E)-stained tissue sections were reviewed by three
pathologists. Manual macrodissection was performed only
when three pathologists reached consensus. The tumor

HT-RNAi screen and hits selection and validation
For HT-RNAi screen, we used DLD1 cell line
because our previous study has shown that DLD1 was the
most resistant to oxaliplatin among 17 CRC cell lines [32].
DLD1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at the density of

combination of the product of reference-normalized copy
number of each gene by its Cox regression corresponding
coefficient. We also dichotomized patients into two groups
using a cut off value of the ratio generated by the spline
regression method. We constructed receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves and calculated the area under
the curve (AUC) to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity
of predicting recurrence and survival. All P values were
2-sided and a P ≤ 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Quantitative PCR and copy number analysis
20 ng of genomic DNA from each sample was
subjected to Quantitative PCR using the SYBR Green
kit (Qiagen, Germany). The PCR program was 15 s of
denaturation at 95℃, 20 s of primer annealing at 58℃
and 20 s of extension at 72℃. GAPDH was used as the
reference gene. Each assay was run in duplicates. Data
points that generated duplicated Ct values with over one
cycle variance were excluded from analysis. The Ct value
obtained from each sample was normalized to the mean
Ct of all samples and then subjected to analysis with the
2−ΔΔCt method [36] . Briefly, the mean Ct for each gene in
all samples was firstly calculated and ΔCt was computed
by subtracting individual Ct from mean Ct. ΔΔCt was then
computed by subtracting ΔCt of a target gene from ΔCt of
the reference gene (GAPDH). Finally, 2-ΔΔCt was calculated
and defined as relative copy number (RCN) of each target
gene [36].

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using
Intercooled STATA software, version 10 (College
Station). Chi-square (x2) analysis was used to evaluate
differences in patient characteristics of categorical
variables and Student’s t test was used to assess the
difference of continuous variables. The study endpoints
were recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival
(OS). RFS was defined as the time from pathologic
diagnosis until first recurrence. OS was calculated from
pathologic diagnosis to death. Due to the challenge in
the normalization of gene copy number, we followed
the procedure described in Boeri et al [37] to compute
the ratio of RCN between high copy number genes
and restricted the analysis to 278 ratios with minimal
individual variation with intra-group variance ≤10 to
reduce the potential false positive findings. To assess the
association of RCN with the recurrence and survival of
CRC, multivariate Cox proportional hazards model was
used to estimate HRs and their 95% confidence intervals
(CI) in the training set, the replication set and pool set,
adjusting for age, gender, stage and histological grade.
Kaplan–Meier method was used to plot RFS and OS
curves with the log-rank test to compare curves. We also
evaluated the combined effects of the significant genes
based on their RCN. For the ratios exhibiting significant
association with recurrence or survival in both the training
and validation data, we constructed the risk scores from
all the possible combinations of the ratios. The risk score
of combined genes for each patient was derived by linear
