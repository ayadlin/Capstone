Geminin Functions Downstream of p53 in K-ras–Induced
Gene Ampliﬁcation of Dihydrofolate Reductase
Ling Shen, Takashi Nishioka, Jinjin Guo, and Changyan Chen

Abstract
DNA strand breakage and perturbation of cell-cycle progression contribute to gene ampliﬁcation events that
can drive cancer. In cells lacking p53, DNA damage does not trigger an effective cell-cycle arrest and in this setting
promotes gene ampliﬁcation. This is also increased in cells harboring oncogenic Ras, in which cell-cycle arrest is
perturbed and ROS levels that cause DNA single strand breaks are elevated. This study focused on the effects of vK-ras and p53 on Methotrexate (MTX)-mediated DHFR ampliﬁcation. Rat lung epithelial cells expressing v-K-ras
or murine lung cancer LKR cells harboring active K-ras continued cell-cycle progression when treated with MTX.
However, upon loss of p53, ampliﬁcation of DHFR and formation of MTX-resistant colonies occurred. Expression
levels of cyclin A, Geminin, and Cdt1 were increased in v-K-ras transfectants. Geminin was sufﬁcient to prevent the
occurrence of multiple replications via interaction with Cdt1 after MTX treatment, and DHFR ampliﬁcation
proceeded in v-K-ras transfectants that possess a functional p53 in the absence of geminin. Taken together, our
ﬁndings indicate that p53 not only regulates cell-cycle progression, but also functions through geminin to prevent
DHFR ampliﬁcation and protect genomic integrity. Cancer Res; 72(23); 6153–62. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
The integrity of the genome of normal, diploid cells is
maintained by cell-cycle checkpoints and damage repair
mechanisms (1, 2). Cell-cycle checkpoints restrain dividing
cells with genetic abnormalities by eliminating them through
induction of apoptosis or by arresting them in the cell cycle for
adequately repairing damages (2–4). Changes in genes controlling cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis occur
in all human cancers. These alterations arise often due to
increased genetic instability, resulting in augmenting drug
resistance, altering immune responses, losing the genetic
homogeneity, and enhancing metastatic potential (5–9) Gene
ampliﬁcation is frequently observed in human malignancies (9,
10). The increased copy numbers of genes do not occur in
normal cells because the surveillance mechanisms eliminate
genetic abnormalities from arising (9, 11). Once gene ampliﬁcation occurs, tumor cells become resistant to genotoxicity
rendered by drugs, such as Methotrexate (MTX) or N-phosphonacetyl-L-aspartate (PALA; refs. 11, 12). The increased
copies of DHFR or carbamyl-P synthetase, aspartate transcarbanylase, digydroorotase (CAD) are frequently associated with
the treatment of these drugs (11, 12).

p53 functions to haut cells in G1 phase of the cell cycle, which
permits repairing MTX or PALA-induced DNA breakages (13–
16). The damaged cells lacking p53 continued to proliferate,
which would initiate gene ampliﬁcations. The deﬁciency of p53
alone was not enough to elicit gene ampliﬁcation (17).
Although p53 plays an important role in DNA replication
(18, 19), the underlying mechanisms by which loss of p53
perturbs the control of DNA replication and permits gene
ampliﬁcation are not fully understood yet.
DNA replication initiated from a particular origin can be
only allowed once per cell cycle. After being replicated, a gene is
licensed for the next round of the replication in the later stage
of the mitosis (20–23). During replication process, a ORC (the
origin recognition complex) complex is formed at particular
sequences of DNA, followed by recruiting replication regulators (such as Cdc6 and Cdt1) to the ORC (24, 25). Geminin
functions as an inhibitor of origin licensing and ensures 1 ﬁre
per cell cycle, through its binding to Cdt1 (26). Multiple ﬁrings
within 1 cell cycle enable a possible increase in gene copies in
the genome. In Drosophila, the deﬁciency of geminin triggered
re-replication (27). Loss of the balance between geminin and
Cdt1 in mammalian cells was also shown to promote gene
ampliﬁcation (28). Cdt1 and Cdc6 were found to be overexpressed in human cultured cells after the inactivation of
p53, possibly through loss of the negative control rendered by
geminin (28). Furthermore, the suppression of geminin
induced the re-replication of DNA in the presence of a functional p53 (29). These studies suggest that p53 controls the
replication or relicensing, possibly via geminin.
Ras plays an essential role in cell proliferation and differentiation (30). As an important signal transducer, Ras governs
multiple downstream effector pathways (31, 32). Growing
evidence links Ras activity to cell-cycle machinery (31, 32).

Ras acts at different phases of the cell cycle, including in the
G1–S boundary and G2–M phases (30, 33–37). In the early
G1 phase, Ras, via affecting cyclin D1, promoted cells to enter
the cell cycle (38). The activation of oncogenes (such as ras or
myc) has been linked to the augment of ROS production
(17, 39–41). ROS, as by-products of oxidative phosphorylation,
are generated from mitochondria, where oxygen molecules are
converted into highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (42). Studies
indicated that a low amount of ROS was required for maintaining cell functions (42). When ROS level was increased, it
was rapidly eliminated by antioxidant enzymes that convert
superoxide anions into less active species (43–45). A persistent
augment of ROS in cells often caused DNA strand breaks
(especially single strand breaks; refs. 43–45).
In this study, we stably infected v-K-ras into Rat lung
epithelial RLE cells. The early passages of RLE/v-K-ras cells
with a wt-p53 were selected for the study. The concentration of
MTX for the selection of DHFR ampliﬁcation in our system was
50 nmol/L that is similar as that shown by others (4) and able to
induce growth arrest in normal cells in a p53-independent
fashion without causing DNA strand breaks. The levels of ROS
and frequencies of DNA breaks were signiﬁcantly increased in
RLE/v-K-ras cells. Although expressing a wt-p53, the ras transfectants with damaged genome still progressed in the cell cycle.
The level of Cdt1 expression was augmented in the cells.
However, the addition of MTX did not induce DHFR ampliﬁcation in RLE/v-ras cells or form the resistant colonies, which
occurred after the knockdown of p53 or geminin, respectively.
The results suggest that p53 protects the stability of the
genome of cells not only through controlling G1 restriction
but also by preventing multiple ﬁrings from ORCs. In this
process, geminin appears as p53 downstream effector to
ensure the ﬁdelity of DNA replication and further of genomic
stability.

Materials and Methods
Cells and materials
Mouse lung epithelial cells, RLE at early passages were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The
cells were stably infected with retroviral vector containing v-Kras. Northern or Western analysis was used to analyze the suppression of p53, geminin or Cdt1 by corresponding shRNA. For
each experiment, a fresh vial of the parental or transfectant
cells was thawed out and used. Murine lung cancer LKR cells
from the lung foci of v-K-ras transgenic mouse and MRP from
the lung foci of the mousev-K-rasþ/p53 were provided by Dr. Tyler
Jacks (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA).
MTX and various inhibitors were purchased from Sigma.
Immunoblotting analysis
After treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in detergent buffer. The
samples were then subjected to 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel and
transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane for the detection of
proteins interested. Anti-p53 and the phospho-ser15-speciﬁc
antibodies were purchased from New England Bio Lab. Antigeminin and Cdt1 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology.

Measurement of ras activation
Active Ras Pull-Down and Detection Kit (Thermo Scientiﬁc)
was used to measure the activation of Ras. GTP bound Ras was
revealed by immunoblotting.
Measurement of ROS
After treatments, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and
resuspended in 5 mg/mL of 20 ,70 -dichlorodihydroﬂuorescein diacetate (DCF, Molecular Probes). Samples were incubated for 10
minutes at room temperature and analyzed immediately (41).
Comet assay
Cell suspension was mixed with 1 mL of 1% low melting
agarose at 40 C and pipetted onto a precoated slide and
covered with coverslip. Triplicate slides were prepared for
each treatment. After the low melting agarose had set, the
slides were submerged in ice-cold lysis buffer [2.5 M NaCl, 100
mmol/L EDTA, and 10 mmol/L Tris HCl (pH 10.5 to 11.5)
containing 1% Triton X-100] for 1 hour. The slides were then
washed with water and submerged in an electrophoresis tank
with alkali buffer [50 mmol/L NaOH and 1 mmol/L EDTA (pH
12 to 12.5)] for 45 minutes. Subsequently, the slides were
electrophoresed for 25 minutes and washed with neutralization buffer [0.5 M Tris HCl (pH 7.5)] for 10 minutes. After dried
the slides, the slides were stained with propidium iodide (2.5
mg/mL) for 20 to 30 minutes and destained in water for 30
minutes. images were visualized using a microscope (46).
Cell-cycle progression analysis
After treatments, cells were ﬁxed with ﬁxation solution
containing 65% ethanol and 35% DMEM. Subsequently, the
samples were stained with staining solution containing 1
PBS, 8 mg/mL RNase and 18 mg/mL propidium iodide, and
incubated in the dark for over 30 minutes at room temperature.
A Becton Dickinson FACScan machine was used to analyze the
samples.
[3H]Thymidine incorporation assay
Cells were starved in DMEM containing 0.5% serum for 24
hours to synchronize the cells. Two microcuries of
[3H]thymidine was added directly to the starvation medium,
with or without the treatments. Twenty-four hours later, the
medium was aspirated and cells were ﬁxed. After washing with
1 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid, cells were solubilized in 1%
sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-0.3 n NaOH. Incorporated radioactivity was determined by a scintillation counter.
Selection for methotrexate resistance
Cells were grown in the presence of MTX (50 nmol/L) for 3 to
4 weeks with media changes every 4 days. Drug resistant
colonies were ﬁxed with 7% formaldehyde in isotonic saline
for 1 hour and stained with 2% crystal violet. The frequency of
MTX-resistant colony relative to the number of cells seeded
was determined (47).
Southern blot analysis
DNAs were prepared from treated and untreated cells. The
genomic DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases,

Role of Geminin in DHFR Ampliﬁcation

precipitated with EtOH, and subsequently dissolved in TE
solution (10 mmol/L Tris, 1 mmol/L EDTA, pH 8.0). Equal
amounts of digested genomic DNA were fractionated by
electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose. DHFR probe
was generated, radiolabeled and hybridized to the
nitrocellulose.
In situ hybridization
Untreated or treated cells were ﬁxed on the slides. Slides
were hybridized with DHFR probe that were labeled with CY3dUTP by nick translation (48). After washed 3 times, slides were
stained with DAPI (40 , 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and then
analyzed by a microscope.

Results
ROS was upregulated in RLE/v-K-ras cells with broken
DNAs
The cells were kept frozen immediately after obtaining
stable v-K-ras transfectants. Newly thawed-out cells were used
for each experiment to ensure that the cells were at early
passages of the infection and expressing a functional p53. Ras
activity in the cells with or without ectopically expressing v-Kras was analyzed by Ras-GTP assay kit (Fig. 1A). Most of Ras in
the transfectant cells, but not that in parental RLE cells, bound
to GTP.

Oncogenes (such as ras or myc) are able to promote the
production of ROS (40, 41). To test the levels of ROS, RLE or
RLE/v-K-ras cells were stained with DCF (dichloroﬂuorescein
diacetate, a peroxidesensitive ﬂuorescent indicator) and then
measured the accumulation of ROS (Fig. 1B). The level of ROS
was increased in RLE/v-K-ras cells and the addition of NCA
(acetyl-L-cysteine, a ROS inhibitor; Fig. 1B, left panel) or
infection with shRNA-ras (Fig. 1B, right panel) blocked ROS
upregulation in RLE/v-K-ras cells, indicating that the increase
of Ras activity is responsible for the ROS accumulation, which
further conﬁrmed that aberrant ras could promote the accumulation of ROS.
To determine the integrity of the genome in the cells, an
alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay) was
carried out to detect DNA single strand breaks at a single cell
level. The photos of RLE or RLE/v-K-ras cells with or without
comet tails were documented (Fig. 1C). The percentage of
cells containing DNA strand breaks was measured in 300
cells for each treatment (Fig. 1D). More than 25% of RLE/v-Kras cells contained migrated DNA tail, and only a few of
RLE cells had broken DNA strands. The addition of NCA (a
ROS inhibitor) signiﬁcantly reduced the percentage of
RLE/v-K-ras with DNA migration tail, suggesting that the
increase of ROS was responsible for DNA damage observed
here.

Figure 1. Oncogenic Ras, via upregulating ROS, induced DNA single-strand breaks. A, Ras GTP-binding activity was measured in RLE or RLR/v-K-ras cells by
Ras-GTP assay. The blot was reprobed by anti-Ras antibody to judge even loading of total proteins. B, RLE cells with or without expressing v-K-ras were
treated with NCA (2.5 mmol/L) or infected with shRNA-ras. After staining with DCF, the cells were analyzed for ROS levels. C, RLE or RLE/v-K-ras cells were
subjected to comet assay and the results were photographed. D, a total of 300 cells were counted under a microscope for DNA migration tail. The error bars
represent the standard deviation from 5 experiments.

G1 restriction was perturbed in RLE/v-K-ras cells
MTX is a drug that can induce a p53-independent growth
arrest in normal cells, but also renders a selective pressure for
cancerous cells to amplify DHFR and form the resistant colonies (17, 49). Since high doses of the drug can also break DNA
strands (17, 49), a dose titration experiment was conducted
and deﬁned that 50 nmol/L of MTX was unable to cause DNA
strand breaks, but able to stop cell growth (data not shown).
The cell-cycle progression after the treatment with MTX was
analyzed (Fig. 2A). Under normal growth conditions, less than
70% of RLE or RLE/v-K-ras cells were in the G1 phase of the cell
cycle. Following MTX treatment for 48 hours, more than 94% of
RLE cells underwent growth arrest. In contrast, there was no
obvious G1 arrest in MTX-treated RLE/v-K-ras cells. To further
conﬁrm the lose of G1 restriction of RLE/v-K-ras cells, a
[3H]thymidine incorporation assay was carried out (Fig. 2B).
The cells were serum-starved for 24 hours, and then treated
with MTX or refed with the medium containing 10% serum.
RLE cells did not incorporate [3H]thymidine into their genome
under serum-starvation condition or upon MTX treatment.
The incorporation was dramatically increased when RLE cells
were refed with the growth medium (10% serum). In contrast,
the rate of incorporating [3H]thymidine into the genome of
RLE/v-Ki-ras cells was moderately affected by serum-depleted
and slightly interfered by MTX treatment. The similar results
were obtained from LKR cells that were isolated from the lung
foci of K-ras transgenic mouse and possess a wt-p53 (49, 50), in
which serum starvation moderately block the incorporation of
[3H]thymidine and MTX had almost no effect on the intake.

These results indicate that the cells expressing oncogenic ras
used different mechanisms to override growth restriction
mediated by serum-starvation- or MTX.
p53, via its multiple functions, suppresses tumorigenesis,
including preventing gene ampliﬁcation (17, 39–41). To test the
activation status of p53 in the cells, immunoblotting assay was
carried out using the antibody against phosphorylated ser-15
of p53 (Fig. 2C). p53 was not activated in RLE cells under
normal growth conditions. A moderate level of phosphorylated
p53 was detected by the antibody in RLE/v-K-ras cells, which
was dramatically upregulated by the DNA damaging drug,
doxorubicin (Fig. 2C, left panels). A similar result was obtained
from LKR cells (Fig. 2C, right panels). The data indicated that
p53 was functional in RLE/v-K-ras and LRK cells. The aberrant
Ras appears perturbing p53-dependent (doxorubicin-induced)
and independent (MTX-mediated) G1 restrictions.
Loss of p53 is crucial for DHFR ampliﬁcation and
formation of MTX-resistant colonies in RLE/v-ras cells
Under MTX or PALA selective pressure, cells with damaged
DNA entered the cell cycle and further acquired the resistance
to these drugs by amplifying DHFR or CAD, respectively (17, 49).
Our data showed that oncogenic ras was able to affect 2 key
elements for the initiation of gene ampliﬁcation: disrupting G1
restriction and causing DNA strand breaks. To test whether
MTX resistant colonies were formed under the oncogenic
stress, RLE cells with or without ectopically expressing v-Kras grew in the growth medium containing 50 nmol/L of MTX
for 3 weeks (Table 1). RLE/v-K-ras cells, like the parental RLE

treatment, lysate from the cells was prepared and immunoblotting was carried out using the antibody against the phosphorylated serine 15 of p53. The blot

cells, failed to give arise to MTX-resistant colonies. However,
after knockdown of p53, RLE/v-K-ras cells were able to form the
resistant colonies under MTX selective pressure. No colony
was detected in MTX-treated RLE cells lacking p53 or RLE/v-Kras cells infected with the scrambled shRNA. Consistently, LKR
infected with shRNA-p53 or MRP cells (isolated from the lung
fuci of the mouseK-rasþ/p53) formed the resistant colonies
under MTX selective pressure.
To conﬁrm that DHFR is ampliﬁed in MTX-resistant colonies, Southern blot analysis was carried out. DNAs from MTXtreated RLE, RLE/v-K-ras, LKR or MRP cells were isolated,
respectively. Subsequently, the expression or ampliﬁcation
of DHFR was analyzed. The gene was undetectable in
MTX-treated RLE or RLE/v-K-ras cells. Consistently, after
knockdown of p53, a high amount of DHFR was present in
MTX-treated RLE/v-K-ras, but not in the treated parental cells
(Fig. 3A, left panels). The effect of the knockdown of p53 by the
shRNA was conﬁrmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 3A, right
panels). Consistently, DHFR was ampliﬁed in MTX-treated
MRP cells, but not in the treated LKR cells (Fig. 3B). The gene
ampliﬁcation could not be detected in untreated MRP or LKR
cells.
FISH assay was then carried out to detect DHFR ampliﬁcation in a single cell (Fig. 3C). Under MTX selective pressure,
RLE/v-K-ras cells with or without being infected with shRNAp53, were subjected to FISH analysis. Two copies of DHFR were
detected in RLE/v-K-ras cells selected with MTX. In contrast,
multiple copies of DHFR existed in RLE/v-K-ras cells after
knockdown of p53. Overall, the results suggested that the
perturbation of G1 restriction and DNA breakage might not
be enough to initiate the process of DHFR ampliﬁcation or
formation of MTX-resistant colonies in cells expressing an
active ras, if p53 was functional. p53 appeared being involved in
another mechanism, other than securing G1 restriction, to
control DHFR ampliﬁcation and MTX resistant colony
formation.

Geminin functioned downstream of p53 in MTXmediated DHFR ampliﬁcation and formation of the
resistant colonies
Strict regulation of DNA replication is essential for protecting the genomic integrity. Geminin, as a crucial inhibitor
of origin licensing, binds to Cdt1 (one of the initiators of
DNA replication) and ensures a single ﬁring at the ORC in
each cell cycle (26). Loss of geminin induced re-replications
and was one of the major causes for gene ampliﬁcation (51).
Therefore, the expression of geminin in RLE cells with or
without expressing v-K-ras was examined by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 4A). The level of geminin was moderately
increased in RLE/v-K-ras cells comparing with that in
parental RLE cells, possibly due to geno-stress rendered by
oncogenic ras. The level of geminin expression in RLE/v-Kras cells was dramatically suppressed after the blockade of
p53 by shRNA-p53 (Fig. 4B, left panels). Consistently, the
amount of geminin in LKR cells was reduced following the
knockdown of p53 (Fig. 4B, right panels). It suggested that
geminin acts downstream of p53 in our experimental
setting.
G1–S regulators are key elements in G1–S phase transition
and the initiation of DNA replication (52). In cells harboring
oncogenic ras, the progressive increase in cyclin D1 was
crucial for the aberrant cell-cycle progression (53). The
importance of cyclin A in the regulation of DNA replication
has also been reported (28). Thus, the levels of the expression of cyclin D1 and A were analyzed (Fig. 4C). The
introduction of v-K-ras signiﬁcantly augmented the expressions of these 2 cyclins. However, the levels of cyclin D1 and
A did not alter by the addition of MTX. The knockdown of
p53 had no role in ras-mediated upregulation of these
cyclins (data not shown). The data suggested that oncogenic
K-ras not only perturbs G1 restriction by upregulating cyclin
D1, but also stimulates DNA replication through affecting
cyclin A.

separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Following transfer to nitrocellulose, DNAs were hybridized with the radiolabeled DHFR probes. C, following the
infection with sc-shRNA or shRNA-p53 for 48 hours, RLE/v-K-ras cells were treated with MTX for 4 days. DHFR (300 bp) fragments were synthesized and
labled with ﬂuorescent-Cy3-dUTP for hybridization. Nuclear DNA was stained with DAPI.

Geminin was unable to interact with Cdt1 in MTX-treated
RLE/v-K-ras cells lacking p53
Cdt1 is a key factor in the initiation of DNA replication and
the primary target of geminin for preventing multiple ﬁrings in
1 cell cycle (51). The level of Cdt1 expression in RLE and RLE/vK-ras cells was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig. 5A). The
amount of Cdt1 in RLE/v-K-ras cells was dramatically
increased in comparison with that in RLE cells, which might
be stimulated by v-ras. However, Cdt1 expression was not
further increased upon MTX treatment (data not shown). To
test if geminin was able to bind to and efﬁciently block Cdt1,
MTX-treated RLE/v-K-ras cells were precleared twice with
anti-geminin antibody before immunoblotting to detect residual or free Cdt1 in the supernatant (Fig. 5B, left 2 lanes of left
panels). There was sufﬁcient amount of geminin in MTXtreated cells that bound to and completely precleared Cdt1.
On the contrary, after knockdown of p53, a high amount of Cdt1
was present in the supernatant of MTX-treated cells. The equal
amount of Cdt1 in MTX-treated RLE/v-K-ras cells with or
without the knockdown of p53 prior to immunoprecipitation
with anti-geminin Ab was analyzed by immunoblotting (Fig.
5B, right 2 lanes of left panels). Together with the data showing
that geminin was moderately (Fig. 4A), but Cdt1 was dramatically upregulated in the cells (Fig, 5A), it suggested that
geminin was either not enough or unfunctional. The same
experiment was conducted with LKR and MPR cells (Fig. 5B,

right panels). A moderate amount of free Cdt1 was detected in
untreated MRP, the level of which was further elevated by MTX
treatment. There was no free Cdt1 detected in the supernatant
of MTX-treated LKR cells, but a high amount of it appeared in
the supernatant after the knockdown of p53. The even loading
of the lysates was analyzed by immunoblotting (data not
shown). The data further implicated that geminin was insufﬁcient to interact with Cdt1 in MTX-treated cells expressing
oncogenic ras after the loss of a functional p53.
Geminin was critical for the establishment of MTXmediated DHFR ampliﬁcation and resistance
We next tested the importance of geminin in the establishment of MTX resistance. RLE/v-K-ras cells were infected with
shRNA-geminin or shRNA-Cdt1. Subsequently, the expression
level of geminin or Cdt1 in the cells was examined by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). The formation of the resistant colonies from RLE or RLE/v-K-ras cells, with or without
geminin or Cdt1, under MTX selective pressure was examined
(Table 2). The resistant colonies were formed from RLE/v-ras
cells after knockdown of geminin, despite that the cells possessed a functional p53. RLE/v-K-ras cells did not form the
colonies after the knockdown of Cdt1. The infections with
scrambled shRNAs did not render the cells the resistance to the
drug. The ampliﬁcation of DHFR was subsequently examined
in genomic DNAs isolated from MTX-treated RLE/v-K-ras cells

after the knockdown of geminin or Cdt1 by Southern blot
analysis (Fig. 6). DHFR gene was ampliﬁed in the cells after
geminin knockdown, but not Cdt1 knockdown. The results
suggested that the perturbation of G1 restriction and DNA
breakage are not enough to initiate the process of DHFR
ampliﬁcation or formation of MTX-resistant colonies, even a
functional p53 was present. Furthermore, besides the involvement in G1 checkpoint, p53 acts on geminin to prevent the rereplication as well as the establishment of MTX resistance in
the cell expressing oncogenic ras.

Discussion
Our investigation aims at addressing the question of whether in acquiring the ampliﬁcation of DHFR and formation of

MTX-resistant colony in cells with damaged DNA, p53 only
functions to control cell-cycle progression. To address the
question, we used rat or murine lung cells stably expressing
v-K-ras with a functional p53. Our study showed that oncogenic
K-ras not only perturbed G1 restriction, but also dramatically
enhanced the level of ROS that subsequently caused DNA
single strand breaks. Although had the broken DNA strands
and entered the cell cycle, these cells harboring v-K-ras did not
acquire DHFR ampliﬁcation or form the resistance colonies
under the pressure of MTX selection. However, after the
knockdown of p53, DHFR ampliﬁcation and MTX resistance
occurred. Geminin is a negative regulator of DNA replication
and required for proper origin licensing during DNA replication (51). Perturbation of geminin triggers reﬁrings of an origin

immunoprecipitated with anti-geminin antibody twice. The supernatants were then immunoblotted with anti-Cdt1 antibody (left 2 lanes of left panels).
The same amount of the lysate from each treatment was immunoblotted with anti-Cdt1 antibody to judge the even loading before the immunoprecipitation
(right 2 lanes of left panels). The same immunoprecipitations and immunoblotting were carried out in LKR and MPR cells.

in 1 cell cycle, often leading to gene ampliﬁcation, aberrant
mitosis and subsequently genetic instability (51). The results
from Western blot analysis showed that geminin was upregulated in the cells expressing v-K-ras in a p53-dependent fashion.
The suppression of geminin also triggered DHFR ampliﬁcation
and formation of MTX-resistant colonies in the ras transfectant, even in the presence of a functional p53. Thus, the results
from our study suggest that besides being involved in the
regulation of G1 restriction, p53, via geminin, controls the
integrity of DNA replication to prevent lung cells harboring
v-K-ras from becoming tolerant to MTX.
Emerging studies indicate that oncogenes, such as ras or
myc, are able to upregulate the level of ROS in cells, which is in
part, required for sustaining mitogenic activity rendered by
oncogenes (17, 39–41). In normal growth conditions, low levels
of ROS have been shown to act as intracellular signal transducers to support various biologic activities (40, 42). Excessive
amounts of ROS cause cellular or genomic damages and
further activate cellular protective machineries, such as stress
response or apoptosis (43–45). In NIH3T3 cells stably expressing v-Ha-ras, augmentated ROS elicit the stress-related
response via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3 kinase)/Rac
pathway (40). The function of ROS was also linked to the
induction of TNFa-mediated apoptosis, which was partially

through JNK signaling pathway (54, 55). In this study, we
showed that the amount of ROS in RLE cells was signiﬁcantly
increased after ectopically expressing a constitutively activated K-ras. The increased ROS was responsible for triggering
DNA breaks, which subsequently mobilized DNA damage
response, for example, the activation of p53. Oncogenic ras
or myc possesses a diversity of functions, including induction of
senescence or apoptosis (17, 39–41). We previously showed
that transient expression of v-ras was able to elicit the apoptotic process in various types of cells in a p53-dependent
fashion (8). It is likely that during the trasfection process to
establish the v-ras transfectants, p53 might play a key role in
preventing majority of cells from becoming transformed, by
directing them to programmed cell death or premature senescence. Afterward, a few survival cells appear to possess a
functional p53 and are still able to activate stress-related,
protective machinery.
Our study showed that p53 in RLE/v-ras was moderately
phosphorylated at its serine-15 residue under normal growth
conditions and further upregulated by doxorubicin, indicating
that p53 was functional. MTX is an inhibitor capable of
blocking deoxynucleode biosynthesis and eliciting a p53-independent G1 arrest (17). RLE/v-ras cells did not undergo growth
arrest following MTX treatment, even under the surveillance of

Role of Geminin in DHFR Ampliﬁcation

an active p53. An increase in Ras activity was shown to
upregulate the expression or activity of cyclin D1 and CDKs
in various types of cells (33, 35). It seems that oncogenic Ras,
perhaps via promoting the activities of cyclin/CDKs, disrupts
both p53-dependent and independent G1 checkpoints in cells.
In the yeasts, replication factors (such as Cdt1, cdc6, and
Mcm proteins) were shown to be phosphorylated by S phase
cyclins (56). After the entering of S phase, cyclin A/cdk2 kinase
activity was progressively increased for the initiation of DNA
replication. Overexpression of Cdt1 or Mcm2/4 was modiﬁed
by S phase cyclin complexes and further induced re-replication
(28). Cylin A was implicated in human cancer cells as a positive
factor for triggering re-replication (20, 57, 58). In our experimental setting, cyclin A was augmented in the ras transfectants. It is conceivable that the upregulation of cyclin A is
responsible for the phosphorylation and further activation of
replication factors that are under the control of p53 after cells
enter S phase of the cell cycle. Knockdown of p53 may permit
the increased cyclin A to phosphorylate replication factors and
promote the re-replication.
Geminin inhibits DNA replication by antagonizing the
activity of Cdt1 and plays a pivotal role in the control of DNA
replication (26). Our study showed that the expression of
geminin was increased in RLE/v-K-ras cells, accompanied with
a signiﬁcant increase of Cdt1. There was no free Cdt1 in the
cytoplasmic fraction of the cells, suggesting that geminin was
capable of interacting with or sequestering this replication
factor. However, in the absence of p53, a high amount of Cdt1
present in the cytoplasma of the cells harboring v-K-ras.
Furthermore, after the knockdown of geminin, DHFR was
ampliﬁed and the resistant colonies were formed under MTX
selection in the cells harboring an oncogenic K-ras, even in the
presence of a wt-p53. These not only indicate that geminin
functions downstream of p53, but also directly link geminin to
the machinery that controls gene ampliﬁcation. During MTX
selection, most of cells expressing oncogenic ras with damaged
DNA would undergo cell death due to the intolerableness to
lethal genetic injuries. However, few cells acquire mutations to
allow multiple replications of genes for survival. This observation is consistent with others' ﬁndings in which gene ampli-

ﬁcation only presents in oncogene-driven tumors with p53
deﬁciency (13–17). By identifying the hierarchic order of p53
and geminin in the regulation of MTX-induced DHFR ampliﬁcation, our work suggests that oncogenes (like ras), by
perturbing cell-cycle restriction and causing DNA strand damage, create a permissive genetic background that potentiates or
facilitates genetic instability. It is necessary to investigate the
initiation of gene ampliﬁcation in various types of cells or cells
expressing different oncogenes, which would permit establishing the link between the defect of DNA damage response and
dysfunction of p53-regulated DNA replication machinery.
Overall, cancerous cells with p53-deﬁcient cells and damaged DNA were unable to arrest in the cell cycle, resulting in
initiating gene ampliﬁcation (37). Studies showed that by
hauling cell-cycle progression, p53 allows cells to repair damage DNA and further keep genomic stability. Our results
presented in this study provide the notion that besides inﬂuencing on cell-cycle checkpoints, p53 controls the balance
between geminin and Cdt1 to prevent the occurrence of gene
ampliﬁcation.
