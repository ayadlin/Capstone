BACKGROUND: Older adults with relapsed/refractory B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r ALL) are reported to have a
poor prognosis and few therapeutic options. In the current study, the authors evaluated treatment with single-agent blinatumomab in
adults aged 65 years with r/r ALL. METHODS: A total of 261 adults with r/r ALL who were examined across two phase 2 studies
received blinatumomab in cycles of 4-week continuous infusion and 2-week treatment-free intervals. The primary endpoint in each
study was complete remission (CR) or CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh) during the first 2 cycles. Data were pooled and analyzed
according to patient age at screening (aged 65 years vs aged <65 years). RESULTS: Of 36 older adults, 56% (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 38%-72%) achieved CR/CRh during the first 2 cycles compared with 46% (225 patients) (95% CI, 40%-53%) of younger
adults. Complete minimal residual disease responses were 60% in older and 70% in younger responders. Three older responders (15%)
and 61 younger responders (59%) proceeded to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Kaplan-Meier curves overlapped
for relapse-free and overall survival for both age groups. Older adults were found to have a similar incidence of grade 3 adverse
events (AEs) as younger adults (86% vs 80%) but more grade 3 neurologic events (28% vs 13%). Cytokine release syndrome
occurred in 7 older (19%) (1 case of grade 3) and 23 younger (10%) (4 cases of grade 3) adults. There were no treatment-related
fatal AEs reported. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with r/r ALL who were treated with single-agent blinatumomab were found to have
similar hematologic response rates and incidence of grade 3 AEs compared with younger adults but had more neurologic events,

INTRODUCTION
The treatment of older patients with B-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains a significant clinical challenge because, in addition to age, older patients have a higher prevalence of poor prognostic factors (eg, Philadelphia chromosome [Ph]-positive disease).1-4 Based on studies in patients aged 50 to 92 years, older adults generally have a lower
tolerance for conventional chemotherapy compared with younger patients, which can result in reduced dose intensity,
lower response rates (58% to 85%), shorter response durations, a higher incidence and more pronounced severities of toxicities, and reduced quality of life.2,5 Older adults also tend to have disease that is more refractory to chemotherapy and
have higher rates of relapse, higher treatment-related mortality, and worse overall survival (OS) (10-year OS rate, 14%21%)2,5,6 compared with younger patients. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloHSCT) after remission can be curative,4,7 but to the best of our knowledge, appropriate conditioning regimens for older patients remain
limited.5

Older adults with relapsed and/or refractory (r/r)
ALL have a particularly poor prognosis, and to our knowledge, there is no standard approach to care in this setting.
The use of various chemotherapeutic agents induces a second complete remission (CR) in <50% of patients,8 and
long-term outcomes are significantly worse, with a 5-year
OS rate of 3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0%6%).7 Therefore, among adults with r/r ALL, older adults
are considered to be very high risk and represent a patient
population with an unmet medical need.
Blinatumomab (Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, Calif)
is a bispecific T-cell engager (BiTEV) antibody construct
that is designed to direct cytotoxic T cells to cluster of differentiation (CD) 19-expressing B cells.9 Two phase 2
studies evaluated the activity and tolerability of blinatumomab in adults with r/r ALL. In a small dose-finding
study of 36 patients aged 18 to 77 years, 69% achieved a
CR or a CR with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), and
88% of responders had a minimal residual disease (MRD)
response. MRD may have a prognostic impact because
persistence of MRD has been associated with a relapse
rate of >90% in younger patients despite continued intensive chemotherapy, and poorer outcomes are expected
among older adults.5 Among responders with CR/CRh,

13 (52%) proceeded to alloHSCT.10 The subsequent confirmatory study included 189 patients aged 18 to 79
years.11 Among 81 patients with CR/CRh (43%), 32
(40%) proceeded to alloHSCT while in remission. Among
73 evaluable patients with CR/CRh, the MRD response
rate was 82% in cycles 1 to 2. The inclusion criteria for
both phase 2 studies did not set an upper age limit for enrolled patients, thereby providing an opportunity to assess
blinatumomab in an older patient population. In the current study, we evaluated the antileukemic activity and tolerability of blinatumomab in older adults (aged 65 years)
with r/r ALL.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were pooled from two phase 2 studies of blinatumomab in adult patients with r/r ALL (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifiers NCT01209286 [dose finding] and
NCT01466179 [confirmatory]). Key characteristics of
each study are provided in Table 1. Detailed descriptions
of both studies have been published previously.10,11

dose-finding study enrolled patients who had primary refractory disease or who had relapsed after induction and
consolidation chemotherapy, including those who had
relapsed after alloHSCT; patients with Ph-positive ALL
who were eligible for dasatinib or imatinib treatment were
excluded.10 The confirmatory study enrolled patients
with ALL who were refractory to first salvage therapy,
experienced their first relapse within 12 months of first
remission or alloHSCT, or were in second or greater
relapse. An additional 36 patients were enrolled in an
extension cohort in the confirmatory study to collect additional safety data, including neurologic events.11 The re2180

spective study protocols were approved by each center’s
Institutional Review Board or ethics committee. All
patients provided written informed consent, and both
studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study Procedures

Stepwise dosing was used in each study to reduce the risk
of cytokine release syndrome (CRS). The final dose from
the dose-finding study was 5 lg/m2/day in the first week
followed by 15 lg/m2/day for the remainder of the
cycle.10 Pharmacokinetic analyses of patients treated on
multiple blinatumomab trials demonstrated equivalent
exposure with fixed dosing and body surface area-based
dosing. All patients in the confirmatory study received
fixed doses of blinatumomab in a stepwise fashion
(9 lg/day in the first week followed by 28 lg/day). Each
treatment cycle included 4 weeks of continuous intravenous infusion followed by a 2-week treatment-free interval. Patients received 2 initial cycles of blinatumomab to
induce remission. If CR or CRh was achieved, the patient
could receive up to 3 additional cycles of blinatumomab
as consolidation therapy, unless alloHSCT was scheduled
earlier.
All patients received intrathecal prophylaxis with
dexamethasone and/or steroids, cytarabine, and methotrexate (Table 1). Patients with a high blast percentage at
baseline received a prephase treatment with dexamethasone and/or cyclophosphamide (Table 1). Detailed
descriptions regarding pretreatment, dose reduction,
interruption, and discontinuation have been published
previously.10,11
Assessments

Hematologic and MRD responses were assessed by bone
marrow aspirate or biopsy on day 29 of each cycle using a
central reference laboratory. Definitions for CR/CRh are
provided in Table 1. MRD response was determined only
for those patients achieving CR/CRh. Complete MRD
response was defined as no detectable clonally rearranged
immunoglobulin and/or T-cell receptor genes using
allele-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain
reaction, as established by a central laboratory (assay sensitivity 10-4 detectable blasts). Adverse events (AEs) and
serious AEs, which were recorded from the time of the initiation of treatment until at least 30 days after treatment
ended, were graded according to the National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (version 4.0).12

Statistical Analysis

The primary endpoint of both studies was the CR or CRh
rate during the first 2 cycles of treatment with blinatumomab. Major secondary endpoints in both studies included
relapse-free survival (RFS), OS, alloHSCT after
blinatumomab-induced remission, and incidence of AEs.
Study-specific definitions for endpoints were used in the
analyses.10,11
The current study was a post hoc analysis using data
pooled from both studies according to patient age at baseline (65 years or <65 years) and included all patients
who received at least 1 blinatumomab infusion. Binomial
exact 95% CIs were provided for response rates and
alloHSCT rates. RFS was measured from the time of first
CR/CRh to hematologic or extramedullary relapse or
death from any cause. OS was measured from the time of
first blinatumomab dose to death from any cause. The
median follow-up times for RFS and OS were provided
using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.13
RESULTS
Demographic and Clinical Characteristics

A total of 36 patients from the dose-finding study10 and
189 patients from the confirmatory study11 were included
in the original studies; an additional 36 patients were later
enrolled in an extension cohort under the confirmatory
study and analyzed separately to collect additional data on
neurologic events. All 261 patients were included in the
current analysis: 36 patients (14%) were older adults
(aged 65 years) and 225 patients (86%) were younger
adults (aged <65 years). Baseline demographics and disease characteristics between older and younger adults were
generally similar, including prior relapses, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and hepatic

impairment. Fewer older adults underwent prior
alloHSCT compared with younger adults (11% vs 37%).
Older adults had more primary refractory disease (14% vs
9%) and were more likely than younger adults to have
mild (42% vs 13%) or moderate (22% vs 1%) renal
impairment at baseline. One patient in each age group
had Ph-positive disease, and both older and younger
adults received blinatumomab therapy for a median of 2
cycles (Table 2).
Response and alloHSCT

Response rates were similar between older and younger
adults (56% vs 46%). Of 36 older adults, 56%
(20 patients) (95% CI, 38%-72%) achieved CR/CRh
during the first 2 treatment cycles (CR in 39% [14
patients] and CRh in 17% [6 patients]). Of 225 younger
adults, 46% (104 patients) (95% CI, 40%-53%) achieved
CR/CRh during the first 2 cycles (CR in 35% [78
patients] and CRh in 12% [26 patients]). Among responders, 60% of older (12 patients) (95% CI, 36%81%) and 70% of younger (73 patients) (95% CI, 60%79%) adults achieved a complete MRD response during
the first 2 cycles (Table 3). Three older (15%) and 61
younger (59%) responders proceeded to alloHSCT. Of
those who proceeded to transplant, 1 older adult and 8
younger adults proceeded to alloHSCT after an initial
response to blinatumomab that was followed by relapse;
all other responders proceeded to alloHSCT while in
remission (Table 4). One younger adult experienced
treatment-emergent graft-versus-host disease in the liver
after alloHSCT while in remission.
RFS and OS

For older adults, the median RFS was 7.4 months (95%
CI, 2.7-23.1 months) and the median OS was 5.5 months

Older and younger adults generally had similar types and
incidences of AEs of any grade (Table 5), but these incidences were at least 10% greater among older adults for
peripheral edema (42% vs 24%), fatigue (28% vs 18%),
and dizziness (25% vs 11%). Older and younger adults
had similar incidences of grade 3 treatment-emergent
AEs (86% vs 80%) and infections (39% vs 34%)
(Table 5). Older and younger adults had a similar incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation (22%
vs 19%). The most common AEs that led to treatment
discontinuation among older adults included encephalopathy (8% of older adults vs 1% of younger adults), disorientation (6% of older adults vs 0.4% of younger adults),
and muscular weakness (6% of older adults vs 0% of
younger adults). A higher incidence of serious AEs was
observed in older adults compared with younger adults
(72% vs 64%), with device-related infection and encephalopathy (both 11% vs 3%) more commonly reported
among older adults than among younger adults. Seven
fatal treatment-emergent AEs were reported for older
adults: pneumonia, which was reported in 3 patients aged
66 years, 72 years, and 76 years; B-cell lymphoma, which
was reported in 1 patient aged 65 years11; and disease progression, which was reported in 3 patients aged 65 years,
70 years, and 75 years. None of the fatal AEs were considered to be related to treatment. No patients in remission
died during treatment with blinatumomab.
Two clinically significant AEs known to occur with
blinatumomab are CRS and neurologic events. The incidence rates of these events are shown in Table 5. The incidence rate of CRS was 19% among older adults and 10%
among younger adults, including grade 3 CRS in 1

older adult (3%; 1 patient with grade 3) and 4 younger
adults (2%; 2 patients with grade 3 and 2 patients with
grade 4). Older adults had more neurologic events of any
grade (72% vs 48%) and more grade 3 neurologic
events (28% vs 13%). In an ad hoc univariate analysis,
increased age was found to be associated with a higher risk
of a neurologic event (odds ratio, 1.018; 95% CI, 1.0041.033), indicating that for every 1-year increase in age, the
odds of a neurologic event increased by 1.8%. Dizziness
and tremor were the most commonly reported neurologic
events in both age groups. Grade 3 neurologic events in
older and younger adults included encephalopathy (11%

and 3%, respectively), aphasia (6% and 1%), confusional
state (6% and 1%), and disorientation (6% and 0%). No
grade 4 neurologic events were observed in older adults,
but 3 younger adults (1%) experienced grade 4 events
(convulsion, delirium febrile, and encephalopathy). Six of
7 older adults and 11 of 14 younger adults who had grade
3 neurologic events leading to dose interruptions subsequently reinitiated treatment with blinatumomab. All
neurologic events were reversible with temporary or permanent discontinuation of blinatumomab. Among the
older adults and younger adults with grade 3 neurologic
events, the median time to the first neurologic event of
grade 3 was 19.0 days and 15.0 days, respectively, and
the median time to resolution of neurologic events was
4.5 days and 4.0 days, respectively.
DISCUSSION
In the current post hoc analysis of pooled results from two
phase 2 studies of single-agent blinatumomab treatment in
adults with r/r ALL, we evaluated outcomes according to
age. Compared with younger adults (aged <65 years),
older adults (aged 65 years) had similar rates of CR/CRh
and MRD responses to blinatumomab and similar median
RFS and median OS (Fig. 1).
Previous studies of conventional chemotherapy consistently reported worse outcomes in older adults compared with younger patients, including lower remission
rates, shorter RFS, and shorter OS.2,3,7,14-20 Worse outcomes have been attributed to poor prognostic factors at
baseline and lower tolerability of chemotherapy in older
patients.2-4 Even when chemotherapy intensity is reduced
to improve tolerability,16,17 worse responses and worse
survival were observed among older patients due to severe
infections and other toxicities of conventional chemotherapy, both of which lead to high rates of induction mortality.2,3,5 In our analysis, older adults had a similar
incidence of any grade AEs and grade 3 AEs during therapy with blinatumomab as younger adults. The types of
reported grade 3 AEs were generally similar between
older and younger adults, and the majority were hematologic events in both age groups. Seven of 36 older adults
had fatal treatment-emergent AEs due primarily to infection; none of the deaths were considered to be related to
therapy with blinatumomab.
CRS and neurologic events are known to occur with
blinatumomab treatment10,11 and other CD19-targeting
therapies, including chimeric antigen receptor-modified
T cells. Older adults experienced a higher incidence of
CRS than younger adults, including a grade 3 CRS in 1
older adult and grade 3 CRS in 4 younger adults. Grade

3 neurologic events during therapy with blinatumomab
were reported more often in older adults than in younger
adults and included encephalopathy, aphasia, confusional
state, and disorientation. The majority of CRS and neurologic AEs were managed with treatment interruption
because blinatumomab is rapidly cleared after continuous
infusion is withdrawn.21 In accordance with the study
protocols, treatment with blinatumomab was interrupted
for neurologic events, CRS, and other treatment-related
AEs and restarted after the event resolved for all patients
except for 1 older and 3 younger adults.
Despite similar outcomes with regard to blinatumomab therapy between older and younger adults, older
adults were found to be less likely than younger adults to
receive alloHSCT either before (11% vs 37%) or after
(15% vs 59%) therapy with blinatumomab. These results
were consistent with alloHSCT use by age groups in typical clinical practice.22 Goldstone et al23 reported that
mortality resulting from alloHSCT was “unacceptably
high” in at-risk patients with ALL, defined as those aged
>35 years with high white blood cell counts. Previous
studies examined outcomes for older adults compared
with younger patients and found that intensive chemotherapy with or without alloHSCT was both less effective
and less well tolerated in older patients compared with
younger patients.2,5 Older adults may tolerate reducedintensity conditioning (RIC) better than full-intensity
alloHSCT, and there is preliminary evidence from retrospective data that the OS rate is similar between RIC
alloHSCT and full-intensity alloHSCT24-26 and that
improved survival after RIC transplantations could be
achieved by optimizing donor selection for grafts containing high CD8 doses.27 This would be particularly important in cases in which RIC alloHSCT remains the only
potentially curative option for older patients who may not
tolerate myeloablative alloHSCT.
In summary, older and younger adults with r/r ALL
who received single-agent blinatumomab therapy in 2 separate phase 2 studies were found to have similar CR/CRh
and complete MRD response rates. Kaplan-Meier curves
overlapped for both RFS and OS. Compared with
younger adults, older adults had a similar incidence of
grade 3 AEs but higher incidences of CRS and neurologic events, either of any grade or of grade 3, which
were reversible and primarily resolved with temporary
treatment interruption. The data support the continued
evaluation of single-agent immunotherapy with blinatumomab for the treatment of older adults with r/r ALL, a
population with a poor prognosis and limited treatment
options.
