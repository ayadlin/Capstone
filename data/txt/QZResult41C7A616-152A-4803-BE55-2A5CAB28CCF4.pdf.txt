ABSTRACT
We hypothesized that plasma-based EGFR mutation analysis for NSCLC may
be feasible for monitoring treatment response to EGFR TKIs and also predict drug
resistance. Clinically relevant mutations including exon 19 deletion (ex19del),
L858R and T790M were analyzed using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in longitudinally
collected plasma samples (n = 367) from 81 NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKI.
Of a total 58 baseline cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples available for ddPCR analysis,
43 (74.1%) had the same mutation in the matched tumors (clinical sensitivity:
70.8% [17/24] for L858R and 76.5% [26/34] for ex19del). The concordance rates
of plasma with tissue-based results of EGFR mutations were 87.9% for L858R and
86.2% for ex19del. All 40 patients who were detected EGFR mutations at baseline
showed a dramatic decrease of mutant copies (>50%) in plasma during the first two
months after treatment. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 10.1 months
for patients with undetectable EGFR v 6.3 months for detectable EGFR mutations
in blood after two-month treatment (HR 3.88, 95% CI 1.48-10.19, P = 0.006). We
observed emerging resistance with early detection of T790M as a secondary mutation
in 14 (28.6%) of 49 patients. Plasma-based EGFR mutation analysis using ddPCR can
monitor treatment response to EGFR TKIs and can lead to early detection of EGFR
TKIs resistance. Further studies confirming clinical implications of EGFR mutation
in plasma are warranted to guide optimal therapeutic strategies upon knowledge of
treatment response and resistance.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has a dismal
prognosis with one of the highest mortality rates among
cancer types [1, 2]. Patients with NSCLC harboring
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation
respond to treatment of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) [3, 4]. Large randomized phase III trials comparing
EGFR TKIs such as gefitinib, erlotinib or afatinib with
cytotoxic chemotherapy consistently demonstrated higher
response rates and prolonged progression-free survival
(PFS) in EGFR mutant NSCLC patients, leading to the
standard treatment of EGFR TKI as first line therapy
[5-8]. However, most patients with NSCLC treated with
EGFR TKIs eventually develop acquired resistance [9,
10]. Although multiple mechanisms are involved, EGFR
T790M mutation accounts for more than 50% of the
acquired TKI resistance [11, 12]. Detection of resistance
requires acquisition and analysis of tumor tissue at the time
of resistance to understand the underlying mechanism.
However, the invasive nature of repeated biopsies makes
it difficult to obtain from patients particularly those
with poor performance. Other limitations include tumor
heterogeneity [13], inaccessibility of re-biopsy due to
tumor location or tumor containing blood vessel or air
bronchogram, high incidence of tumor necrosis, and a
single snapshot in time unable to track dynamic changes
in the mutation.
The circulating tumor DNA in plasma with its
non-invasive technology has been used as a surrogate
for tumor tissues in detecting genetic alterations, thus
providing molecular evolution of the tumors [1417]. Bai et al. showed the difference in response rates
(59.5% and 23.1%, P = 0.002) for gefitinib between
patients with and without activating EGFR mutation in
plasma [18]. Recently, droplet digital polymerase chain
reaction (ddPCR), a highly sensitive technology has been
developed for detecting low frequency cancer-associated
mutations [19]. We hypothesized that plasma-based
EGFR mutation analysis using ddPCR may be feasible
in monitoring response and resistance to EGFR TKIs.
Therefore, we conducted a multi-center prospective study
to assess dynamic changes in EGFR mutation profile
using a ddPCR method in longitudinally collected plasma
samples from NSCLC patients harboring activating EGFR
mutations treated with EGFR TKIs.

were enrolled. The median age was 58.2 years (range,
32.1-81.1 years), 61.7% were female, and 63.0% were
never smokers. Over four-fifths of patients (84.0%) had
stage IV disease, 59.3% had ex19del and 59.3% were
treated with EGFR TKIs as first-line therapy (Table 1).

Clinical outcomes
Of total 81 patients, 59 (72.8%) patients achieved
an objective response. With a median follow-up of 18.8
months, the median PFS and overall survival (OS) were
8.1 months (95% CI, 6.2-10.0) and 23.5 months (95% CI,
19.4-27.6), respectively.

The technical sensitivity and specificity of L858R
and ex19del assays in the cfDNA

RESULTS

The sensitivity and specificity of the ddPCR assays
in measuring EGFR mutations in cfDNA were determined
from 367 plasma samples collected from baseline to every
8 weeks after EGFR TKI treatment from 81 patients. We
applied two QC criteria for the results of these plasma
samples: 1) the droplet number must be greater than

9000; 2) the wild type (WT) levels to be greater than 100
copies/mL. After QC, we excluded two patients and 6 time
points, resulting in 361 samples from 79 patients (Figure
1). Among the qualified samples, the lowest level of WT
cfDNA was 1040 copies/mL, and the median was 4568
copies/mL (data not shown), suggesting that good quality
of cfDNA is obtained with the current sample preparation
procedures.
Since ddPCR assays are very sensitive in
quantifying rare mutation events, we were able to detect
very low MT allele frequency (AF) in the cfDNA for
both L858R and ex19del mutations. The lowest MT AF
detected among 57 L858R+ samples was 0.003%, while
among 113 ex19del+ samples was 0.005% (Figure 2A).
To test the specificity, we analyzed the results based on
the mutual exclusivity of the two mutations in the same
sample. For the L858R assay, we observed no L858L
mutant copies in the 110 ex19del+ plasma samples (Figure
2B); for ex19del assay, no ex19del mutant copies were

detected in the 57 L858R+ samples (Figure 2C), which
demonstrated 100% of specificity.

Clinical sensitivity of plasma-based EGFR
mutation assays and their concordances with
tissue mutation status
The clinical sensitivity of the EGFR mutation
detection in plasma was assessed among 58 patients
whose baseline samples were available. L858R or ex19del
mutations were detected in 43 patients (Table 2) yielding
sensitivity of 74.1% (43/58); 70.8% (17/24) for L858R
and 76.5% (26/34) for ex19del. We assessed the specificity
based on the mutual exclusivity of L858R mutation and
ex19del mutation in EGFR mutant tumors. No L858R
mutation was detected in the ex19del patient plasmas,
and vice versa. Therefore, the specificity of cfDNA
L858R assay and ex19del assay was 100% (34/34) and

100% (24/24) respectively. The concordance rate between
cfDNA and tissue was 87.9% for L858R and 86.2% for
ex19del before treatment.
We then examined the EGFR mutation detection
rate in plasma from patients who experienced progressive
disease (PD). Of 79 patients, 49 patients had plasma
samples available at the time of progression. Among 49
patients, L858R and ex19del mutations were detected in
32 patients, resulting in 65.4% (32/49) clinical sensitivity
in plasma at disease progression (Figure 1, Table 2).
We subsequently assessed the detection rate
of resistance mutation T790M among patients who
developed PD. As described previously [20], the technical
background of T790M assay in fresh and FFPE gDNA is
0.03% and 0.05%, respectively. The quadruplicate repeats
of the test were implemented in determining the true
positives of plasma T790M measurements. Among the
four data points for each sample, only those with at least
three non-zero readings were considered as positives. With
these criteria, 50 out of 361 samples were positive in the
T790M detection. The lowest allele frequency detected
was 0.017% and the median was 1.24% (Figure 2A).
Among 49 patients with available samples at the time of
progression, 14 patients (28.6%) had detectable T790M in
their plasma.

To investigate whether cfDNA mutation level can
be used to monitor the treatment response and resistance
longitudinally, we analyzed plasma samples at specified
times over the course of treatment cycle. Among 79
patients, five patients who had only one time point and
four who had neither baseline nor PD data points were
excluded for analysis (Figure 1). In addition, 24 samples
collected beyond disease progression were excluded.
Among 70 patients with more than 1 available time point,
33 patients had both baseline and PD points, 21 patients
had only baseline, and 16 had only PD (Figure 1, Table 3).
The level of L858R copies at baseline were shown
to be significantly (P = 0.0068) associated with shorter
PFS. But we did not see the correlation in ex19del
(Supplementary Figure 1). Among the 54 patients whose
baseline samples were available for analysis, L858R or
ex19del mutations were detected in 40 patients’ plasmas
at the baseline. All 40 patients showed decreased mutant
DNAs in circulation after EGFR TKI treatment. Of
note, 34 patients (85.0%) had plasma EGFR mutations
decreased to the undetectable level (0 copy) during
the treatment cycle compared to the baseline (Table
3, Supplementary Figure 2). Intriguingly, there was

a significant difference in PFS between patients with
undetectable EGFR mutation and detectable EGFR
mutation (10.1 months vs 6.3 months; HR 3.88, 95% CI
1.48-10.19, P = 0.006; Figure 3A). Similarly, the median
OS of patients with undetectable EGFR and detectable
EGFR were 23.7 and 11.2 months, respectively (HR 5.97,
95% CI 2.04-17.47, P = 0.001; Figure 3B). Of 49 patients
with PD plasma samples, 15 patients (30.6%) showed
increased mutation level at the PD time point, and 12
patients (24.5%) showed increased mutation level about 2
to 12 months earlier than the PD time point, as judged by
the primary mutation L858R or ex19del (Figure 1, Table
3).
Among 49 patients with available samples at the
time of progression, the T790M mutation was detected
in 8 patients (16.3%) as early as 2 to 12 months prior
to radiological progression: the remaining 6 patients
(12.2%) developed T790M mutation at the time of PD

(Supplementary Figure 3). It is noteworthy that one patient
had detectable prior treatment T790M mutation. Although
plasma ex19del and T790M levels were decreased with
clinical response after gefitinib treatment in patients with
de novo T790M mutation, brain and bone metastases
occurred after 6 months of gefitinib treatment.
The tumor volume was assessed using Chest CT
scans by radiologists (HY Lee, and SH Bak) for each
patient every eight weeks. Figure 4 shows the levels
of circulating two EGFR primary mutations and the
corresponding tumor volumes over the course of treatment
to disease progression. In patients whose plasma T790M
mutation was detected at the time of progression, T790M
was generally at slightly lower levels than the primary
mutations. In one patient (#2) with a response to gefitinib,
an increase in plasma ex19del and T790M levels was
seen during the development of bone metastasis (Figure
4). Two patients (#10 and #88) showed an increase in

with high sensitivity [24-26], the detection of samples with
low mutation fractions has uncertain clinical significance
[27]. The study by Zhang et al. [20] demonstrated the
feasibility of applying the ddPCR system to detect EGFR
mutation and the advantage of ddPCR in the detection of
samples with low EGFR mutation fractions.
In the present study, we demonstrated 74.1%
sensitivity and 100% specificity of a plasma assay for
EGFR mutations using ddPCR. The concordance rates of
L858R and ex19del were 87.9% and 86.2%, respectively.
Our results are consistent with those from previous studies
[28, 29] and support the use of this technology in clinical
practice for making treatment decisions especially for
patients not amenable to tissue biopsy. The relatively
lower clinical sensitivity of EGFR mutations in patients at
the time of disease progression (65%) is likely attributed to
the tumor shrinkage after drug treatment and the collection
time of plasma samples near or at the PD stage.
In the current study with a total of 40 patients whose
plasma collections from baseline were available for a
longitudinal analysis, we observed a marked decrease in
plasma EGFR mutations during the first 2 months in all
patients after EGFR TKI treatment. More intriguingly, 34
patients (85%) had EGFR level decreased to undetectable
level with longer PFS and OS than those with detectable
EGFR in blood. In addition, the levels of both EGFR
primary and resistance mutations in plasma increased

DISCUSSION
The development of acquired resistance to
anticancer therapy derives from clonal evolution and
selection [21, 22]. Thus, serial biopsies for the tumor
are required to identify the underlying drug resistance
mechanism and potential therapeutics to overcome or
prevent it. Moreover, monitoring treatment response
accompanied by mutations in the tumor genome may be
needed to evaluate the potential benefits of targeted cancer
therapies and subsequently determine and tailor optimal
treatment strategies for patients. However, detection
of EGFR mutations in NSCLC patients using sampling
tumor tissues has significant limitations including tumor
heterogeneity and difficulty in obtaining samples. As
a non-invasive liquid biopsy capable of identifying
molecular changes, genomic analysis of circulating tumor
DNA released from cancer cells into blood has been
proposed to determine real-time genomic landscapes of
the tumor without additional burden and risk to patients
[23].
Although several studies have suggested that cfDNA
from patients with cancer can be used to detect mutations

progressively during disease progression. These findings
suggest that longitudinal monitoring of plasma EGFR
mutation levels can be a good predictive biomarker.
Sorensen et al. [30] and Mok et al. [31] also showed the
predictive value of serial assessment of cfDNA during
treatment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
study that evaluates longitudinal measurements of tumor
volume with serial assessments of tumor DNA in blood
for NSCLC patients treated with EGFR TKIs. The trend
of mutation titer in plasma was well correlated with the
tumor volume as measured by CT scan.
EGFR T790M is one of the most common mutations
associated with acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in
NSCLC patients, which accounts for 50-60% [11, 32]. At
present, the presence of T790M mutation is determined
upon taking a new biopsy of the tumor from the patients at
the time of progression. Given the limitations of repeated
invasive biopsies, several studies were investigated to
analyze acquired resistance to cancer therapies by noninvasive methods using plasma DNA [29, 33, 34]. We
found that 14 patients (28.6%) among a total of 49 patients
harbored resistance mutation T790M in the blood during
EGFR TKIs treatment, which is similar to the study by
Sakai et al. [35] in which T790M mutation was detected
in 21 (30%) of 75 plasma samples from patients with
clinical PD using the single allele base extension reaction
(SABER) assay. It is noteworthy that the T790M mutant
alleles were detectable in the blood of EGFR TKIstreated patients as early as 12 months before radiographic
documentation of disease progression in our study.
This suggests that cfDNA may have important clinical
implications as a useful surrogate biomarker of therapeutic
response and be used to identify the development of
resistant mutation, especially in early detection before it
becomes clinically detectable. Furthermore, the detection
of T790M mutation in cfDNA would be clinically
useful for patients who are not amendable to repeated
biopsies. Given the promising clinical results of several
3rd generation EGFR TKIs in patients with T790M
mutation [36-38], these treatment therapies will soon
be available and accessible warranting effective clinical
diagnostics to evaluate drug resistance. However, it still
remains undetermined whether T790M mutation detected
in cfDNA prior to clinically overt progression will
change treatment decisions because patients harboring
this mutation are usually indolent and EGFR TKI can be
continued beyond progression [39]. Therefore, the clinical
impact of early detection of the resistance mutation in
plasma DNA needs to be elucidated in the near future.
In conclusion, this study demonstrated that plasma
EGFR assay using ddPCR can be feasible and effective
in monitoring treatment response to EGFR TKIs, and
detecting the underlying mechanism of resistance in a
noninvasive method. Determining the genetic landscapes
of tumors through noninvasive real-time mutational
profiling may have significant clinical implications in

identifying and guiding optimal treatment strategies,
particularly when T790M mutation is detected in the
blood.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
This was an exploratory study to evaluate the
potential utilization of EGFR mutations in plasma using
ddPCR in monitoring treatment response and resistance
among NSCLC patients harboring EGFR activating
mutations treated with EGFR TKIs. Eligible patients had
a diagnosis of advanced or recurrent NSCLC harboring
activating EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R)
who had progressed on gefitinib or erlotinib. The analysis
of EGFR (exon 18-21) mutations for tumor tissues
obtained from either diagnostic or surgical procedures was
performed prior to TKI treatment by direct sequencing or
PNA-clamp method (Panagene Inc., Daejeon, Korea).
Patients were treated with gefitinib (250 mg po daily) or
erlotinib (150 mg po daily) at the discretion of treating
physicians. Appropriate imaging measures including CT
scans of the chest were performed every two cycles (8
weeks) and evaluated treatment response according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST
version 1.1). All patients provided written informed
consent. This study was performed in accordance with
the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by Institutional
Review Board for Human Research at each institute.
The primary objective of this exploratory analysis
was to assess the diagnostic utility of the blood test for
sensitivity, specificity, concordance rate, and comparison
with tumor tissue EGFR mutation status. The secondary
objectives included identifying the time difference
between development of genetic aberrancy associated with
resistance in plasma and overt clinical progression.

Sample collection and DNA extraction
Plasma samples were prospectively obtained
before treatment and every 8 weeks post-treatment until
development of disease progression for cell-free DNA
(cfDNA) EGFR ddPCR testing. Blood was collected
into one 10-mL EDTA-containing vacuum tube and
was centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes within 4
hours of collection. The supernatants were collected and
centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 15 minutes. The plasmas were
transferred to 1.5-mL Eppendorf tubes and stored at -70°C
until DNA extraction. The cfDNA was extracted from 1-2
mL of plasma using QIAamp Circulating Nucleic Acid Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Considering the recent studies that the conventional
RECIST-based assessment alone does not fully
characterize response and progression in genomically
characterized patients [40, 41], we further explored the
volumetric tumor response during TKI therapy. All CT
image data were reconstructed with a section thickness of
1.25 mm using soft-tissue algorithms. For each measurable
lesion, volume measurements were performed with a
semi-automated segmentation method using MRIcro
(version 1.40, Chris Rorden, University of Nottingham,
Great Britain). Using in-house software, the computer
automatically calculated the volume (cm3) by multiplying
the number of voxels segmented by the unit volume of a
voxel. A sum of the volume for all target lesions at each
time-point was used for the analysis.

Statistical analysis
Sensitivity was calculated as the number of samples
positive in both tissue and plasma out of the positive
tissue samples, whereas specificity was calculated from
the number of plasma- and tissue-negative samples out of
the total negative tissue samples. Concordance rate was
calculated as the number of samples positive in both tissue
and plasma, plus the number of samples negative in both
tissue and plasma, out of the total number of matched
samples. Survival estimates were calculated according to
Kaplan-Meier method. Cox regression methods were used
for biomarker at baseline associated with PFS. Statistical
analysis was performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC) and R version 3.0.3 (Vienna, Austria; http://
www.R-project.org/). A 2-sided P-value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
