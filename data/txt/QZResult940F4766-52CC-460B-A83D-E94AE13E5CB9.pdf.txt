ABSTRACT
nc886 or VRNA2-1 has recently been identified as a noncoding RNA instead of a
vault RNA or a pre-microRNA. Several studies have reported that pre-miR-886 plays a
tumor-suppressive role in a wide range of cancer cells through its activity as a cellular
protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) ligand and repressor. However, by sequencing
stem-PCR products, we found that a microRNA originating from this precursor, vault
RNA2-1-5p (VTRNA2-1-5p), occurs in cervical cancer cells. The expression levels
of the predicted targets of VTRNA2-1-5p are negatively correlated with VTRNA2-15p levels by quantitative reversion transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Previous results
have shown that VTRNA2-1-5p is overexpressed in human cervical squamous cell
carcinomas (CSCCs) compared with adjacent healthy tissues. Inhibition of VTRNA21-5p increases Bax protein expression and apoptotic cell death in cervical cancer
cells. Our findings suggest that VTRNA2-1-5p has oncogenic activity related to the
progression of cervical cancer. Here, we report that VTRNA2-1-5p directly targeted
p53 expression and functioned as an oncomir in cervical cancer. VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibition decreased cervical cancer cell invasion, proliferation, and tumorigenicity
while increasing apoptosis and p53 expression. Interestingly, VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition
also increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis of HeLa and SiHa cells. In human clinical
cervical cancer specimens, low p53 expression and high VTRNA2-1-5p expression
were positively associated. In addition, VTRNA2-1-5p was found to directly target
the 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of p53. We propose that VTRNA2-1-5p is
a direct regulator of p53 and suggest that it plays an essential role in the apoptosis
and proliferation of cervical cancer cells.

INTRODUCTION

squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and adjacent healthy
tissue, we found that miR-886-5p is highly overexpressed
in cancerous tissue. Further research showed that miR886-5p inhibits the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by
down-regulating the expression of Bax [6].
Pre-miR-886 is composed of approximately 102
nucleotides and located on chromosome 5q31.1, and
it has been considered a miRNA precursor because its
mature forms, miR-886-5p and miR-886-3p, which can
be captured by high-throughput sequencing, might be

Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer
in women, and the integration of human papillomavirus
(HPV) DNA into the host genome is a typical, although
not exclusive, step in cervical carcinogenesis [1, 2].
MicroRNAs have been suggested to play an important role
in cervical carcinogenesis [3-5]. In a previous investigation
of miRNAs that are differentially expressed in cervical

produced by Dicer [7, 8]. However, experimental evidence
suggests that miR-886 is not a canonical miRNA but a
vault RNA (VTRNA) because the sequence alignments
clearly identify this sequence as a VTRNA homolog
or a molecule associated with the vault complex [9,
10]. Hence, the revised name “VTRNA2-1” has been
approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee
(http://www.genenames.org/) and included in various
databases, such as the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/) and the UCSC genome browser (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/). Recently, Lee et al. provided solid experimental
evidence that pre-miR-886 is neither a VTRNA nor a
canonical miRNA, although they could not rule out the
possibility that only a minute amount of pre-miR-886
is associated with major vault protein (MVP) and has a
biological function [11]. Despite the divergence in the
characterization of pre-miR-886, all the available data are
consistent in suggesting that human VTRNAs are RNA
polymerase III (Pol III) transcripts with defective stemloop secondary structures.
To date, human studies have identified four VTRNA
genes clustered on chromosome 5 (VTRNA1-1, 1-2,
1-3 and 2-1) and a pseudogene on chromosome X [10].
VTRNA associates with the vault complex, a large hollow
barrel-shaped RNP complex with a size of 13 MDa.
The vault consists of multiple components, including
MVP, which constitutes over 70% of the vault complex;
two minor proteins, TEP1 and VPARP; and VTRNAs.
VTRNAs only represent approximately 5% of the
particle mass, and approximately 20% of the VTRNAs
are associated with vaults, with the majority localized in
the soluble fraction. We can’t rule out miR-886 functional
role as a VTRNA despite the fact that VTRNA2-1 was not
detected in the P100 fraction; instead, 97% of VTRNA2-1
is found in the S100 fraction when pre-miR-886 is cofractionated with MVP.
Thus, additional work is required to elucidate the
function of VTRNA2-1 and its interaction with vault in
the future. The vault complex may play a role in cellular
resistance to anti-cancer drugs [12]. Pre-miR-886 is
repressed in a wide range of cancer cells, and Lee et al.
have suggested a tumor-suppressive role for pre-miR-886;
however, the exact nature of its role remains unclear.
Taking our previous work into consideration, we
suggest that miR-886 is a VTRNA. We cannot rule out
that it may have vault-independent functions, such as that
of a microRNA precursor. Generally, small RNAs regulate
the expression of their targets at the post-transcriptional
or translational level by their incorporation into the RNAinduced silencing complex (RISC) [13]. The Argonaute
(AGO) protein is an important protein component of
RISC. Thus, the isolation of AGO-associated small RNAs
and the target genes of miRNAs constitutes an important
approach for identifying functional small RNAs and their
target genes [14-16].
In the present study, we investigated the effect of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition on cervical cancer cells and
found that such inhibition resulted in cell apoptosis and
p53 up-regulation. Also known as protein 53 or tumor
protein 53, p53 is a tumor suppressor protein with a key
upstream role in the apoptosis pathway in cancer [17]. In
fact, the MVP promoter region may contain a functional
p53-binding site (unpublished results of Berger et al) [12].
Furthermore, in chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
experiments, Park et al. observed that p53 binds directly
to the MVP promoter, and they suggested that p53 may act
as a major transcriptional factor for the MVP gene [18].
Because we can demonstrate that p53 is a direct target of
VTRNA2-1-5p, we suggest that miR-886 is a VTRNA.

RESULTS
Does VTRNA2-1-5p occur in cervical tissues and
cells?
In 2011, the Lee laboratory failed to detect miR-8865p and miR-886-3p in various human organs and certain
cancer cells by Northern blotting [11, 17]. This result
raised the question of whether VTRNA2-1-5p is present
in cervical cancer tissues or cells. To address this question,
we measured VTRNA2-1-5p levels by Northern blotting
using a highly sensitive probe specific to VTRNA2-1-5p.
The expected band of ~22 nt was not observed in cervical
or breast tissues or in cervical cells, whereas mature let-7e
was detected in cervical cancer tissues (Figure 1A). Our
data are consistent with the report of Lee et al. However,
we detected two bands of ~90 nt and ~70 nt in cervical
and breast tissues and in cervical cancer cells. Because
the intracellular levels of VTRNA2-1-5p may be too low
for detection by Northern blotting, we electrophoresed
and sequenced VTRNA2-1-5p stem-loop qPCR products
and sequenced VTRNA2-1 from SiHa and HeLa cells as a
control (Figure 1B). The alignment results of VTRNA2-15p and VTRNA2-1 showed that VTRNA2-1-5p is present
in cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Next, we tested
whether VTRNA2-1 is processed into mature miRNAs
by the RISC complex. An RNP immunoprecipitation
(RIP) assay was used, and endogenous AGO-containing
miRNP complexes in SiHa cells and their associated
mRNAs were pulled down using an anti-AGO 2A8
antibody. The migration of the anti-AGO RIP sample
showed two main peaks at approximately 2000 and
4000 nucleotides, which corresponded to 18S and 28S
ribosomal RNA, respectively (Figure 1C). The Western
blotting results confirmed that AGO was specifically
immunoprecipitated by the anti-AGO antibody but not
by control mouse IgG (Figure 1D). The VTRNA2-1-5p
in the RNP complex was also quantitated by stem-loop
qPCR. The VTRNA2-1-5p content of the anti-AGO
RIP RNA complex was 22-fold higher than that of the

control mouse IgG RIP RNA complex (0.006 vs. 0.0003)
(Figure 1E). Because VTRNA2-1-5p occurs in the cell
and VTRNA2-1 can be processed into mature VTRNA21-5p, changes in the VTRNA2-1-5p level should impact
the level of VTRNA2-1. Therefore, we performed qRTPCR to determine the VTRNA2-1 level under VTRNA21-5p suppression and overexpression in HeLa cells.
Consistent with our predictions, VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitors
significantly down-regulated the level of VTRNA2-1 (p
< 0.05), whereas exposure of the cells to VTRNA2-1-5p
mimics did not impact the level of VTRNA2-1 (p > 0.05,

Figure 1F), which was highly abundant (~105 molecules
per cell) in HeLa. Another important question is whether
VTRNA2-1-5p was functional as a mature miRNA. In
the reports of miranda [19], PITA and Lee et al. [11],
five target genes of hsa-miR-886-5p were predicted,
and we detected the expression of these genes in HeLa
cells under VTRNA2-1-5p suppression by qRT-PCR (for
primer information, refer to Supplementary Table S4).
The results showed that when VTRNA2-1-5p was 2-fold
down-regulated, the five predicted targets, including
ZNF785, SLC25A45, LAT2, EGR3 and DMPK, were up-

and the surrounding normal tissue control (Ib para) from the same patient. The blot was evaluated with a high-sensitivity probe specific
to VTRNA2-1-5p. Human U6 was used as a loading control. Molecular size in nucleotides is indicated on the left. To rule out technical
artifacts, let-7e was detected as a control in cervical tissues using a high-sensitivity probe specific to let-7e. B. After stem-loop qPCR
of VTRNA2-1-5p and qRT-PCR of VTRNA2 in HeLa and SiHa, the products were resolved on a 2% agarose gel and visualized using
GoldView staining. The bands consisted of the expected 102-nt band of VTRNA2 and a 54-nt band representing VTRNA2-1-5p. (C, D, E)

regulated by 3.5-fold, 2.0-fold, 3.5-fold, 2.3-fold and 2.1fold, respectively (n = 3, p < 0.05, Figure 1G). Thus, we
concluded that VTRNA2-1-5p may be a functional mature
miRNA.

2A and 2B), whereas strong expression of p53 ( > 90%)
was only observed in the breast cancer tissue (Figure
2A, Right). Thus, the levels of VTRNA2-1-5p and p53
expression differ in cervical and breast tissues.
The expression of p53 was also assessed by IHC
and Western blotting in three cervical epithelial cell lines
(H8, SiHa and HeLa). We first determined the VTRNA21-5p expression level in these cell lines, and the results
showed that VTRNA2-1-5p was present at a higher level
in HeLa and SiHa cells than in H8, which is an HPV
16-immortalized human cervical mucosal epithelial
cell line (Figure 3B). The positive indexes for p53 were
9±0.075% (H8), 7±0.056% (SiHa), and 5±0.064% (HeLa)
(Figure 3A and Supplementary Table S6). When the total
amounts of protein were equivalent (i.e., 50 µg), the levels
of the various p53 isoforms in the H8 cells were all higher
than those found in the SiHa and HeLa cells (Figure 3C
and 3D). Evidently, VTRNA2-1-5p is overexpressed
in cervical cancer tissue and cell lines, whereas p53 is
expressed at low levels.

Increased expression of VTRNA2-1-5p and
reduced expression of p53 in cervical cancer
tissues and cells
According to the graded ISH results, the expression
of VTRNA2-1-5p was consistently higher in cervical
cancer tissues (average grade = 2.79) than in adjacent
normal tissues (average grade = 1.52, p < 0.0001, n = 31),
whereas the expression of U6 in cervical cancer tissues
(average grade = 3.75) was similar to that in normal tissues
(average grade = 3.62, Figure 2A and 2B, Supplementary
Figure S2).
Immunohistochemical staining for p53 was negative
in the normal cervical tissue adjacent to tumors and in
normal breast tissue (Figure 2A, left and right), which
may have been caused by the low p53 levels in normal
tissues. p53 staining was also low in cervical cancer tissue
(Figure 2A, left). VTRNA2-1-5p was highly expressed in
both breast cancer tissue and the adjacent normal breast
tissue (average grade = 3.98 and 3.77, respectively, Figure

VTRNA2-1-5p promotes cervical cancer cell
proliferation and invasion

proliferation in case of HeLa cells compared to SiHa
might be caused by the difference of cells growth. The
growth speed in SiHa mock showed quicker than that
of in HeLa mock. The results of the Transwell invasion
assays showed that treatment with the VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitor for 24 hours reduced the invasive activity of
SiHa and HeLa cells (SiHa with inhibitor: p = 0.0001;
HeLa with inhibitor: p = 0.003; n = 6), whereas treatment
with the mimic enhanced this activity (SiHa with mimic:
p < 0.0001; HeLa with mimic: p = 0.004, n = 6; Figure
4C). We also evaluated transfection efficiency by stemloop qPCR at 24 hours and found that the VTRNA2-1-5p
mimic significantly increased the levels of VTRNA2-1-5p
(p < 0.05, n = 3) at 24 hours (Supplementary Figure S3A).
These results show that VTRNA2-1-5p promoted cervical
cancer cell proliferation and invasion in vitro.

To measure cell proliferation and invasion, HeLa
and SiHa cells were transfected with a VTRNA2-15p mimic and a VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor as well as
their respective negative controls. We then evaluated
transfection efficiency by stem-loop qPCR at various time
points, and the results showed that the VTRNA2-1-5p
mimic significantly increased the levels of VTRNA2-1-5p
at 24, 48 and 72 hours (p < 0.05), whereas the inhibitor
decreased these levels (p < 0.01, n = 6) (Figure 4A).
The MTT assay results showed that cell proliferation
was enhanced in HeLa and SiHa cells transfected with
the VTRNA2-1-5p mimic (Figure 4B). Conversely,
cell proliferation was reduced in cells transfected with
the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor (Figure 4B). Less cell

transfection efficiency was verified by GFP expression.
These data provide in vitro evidence for the growthpromoting role of VTRNA2-1-5p.

To evaluate the growth of SiHa and HeLa cervical
cancer cells transfected with a VTRNA2-1-5p mimic and
inhibitor, colony formation by these cells was measured.
The mimic-transfected GFP-positive cells formed larger
colonies than the non-transfected controls or cells
transfected with an empty vector (p = 0.002 for SiHa
and p = 0.047 for HeLa cells, Figure 5A, Supplementary
Figure S3B). Conversely, the inhibitor-transfected GFPpositive cells formed fewer and smaller colonies relative
to the control cells (p = 0.001 for SiHa and p = 0.008 for
HeLa, n = 6, Figure 5A, Supplementary Figure S3B). The

To confirm our findings, an in vivo model was
employed. SiHa cell lines were stably transfected with
a plasmid expressing a VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor, and
the knockdown efficiency of selected GFP-positive
cells was evaluated by stem-loop qPCR (Figure 5B).
VTRNA2-1-5p was reduced by nearly 50% in the cells
expressing the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor (Figure 5B).

VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition enhances cisplatininduced apoptosis of cervical cancer cells

Untreated SiHa cells and cells transfected with a control
vector or with the plasmid expressing the VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitor were administered through subcutaneous (s.c.)
injections into the posterior flank of nude mice. Two
weeks after the injection, tumors developed in 100% of
the untreated (mock) and control vector-transfected mice,
whereas tumors developed in only 20% of the mice that
had received VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor-expressing cells
(Figure 5C, upper). Moreover, the average tumor volume
in the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor group (0.005±0.010
mm3) was smaller than the average tumor volume in the
untreated (0.031±0.018 mm3, p = 0.03) and control vectortransfected animals (0.034±0.010 mm3, p = 0.001, n = 5,
Figure 5C, middle). We also performed H&E staining
of tumors from the mock, vector control-, and inhibitortransfected SiHa cells (Figure 5C, lower). H&E staining
of the tumors showed that all were CSCCs. Overall,
our findings suggest that introducing a VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitor may serve to limit the growth of cervical cancer
cells.

Previous published results showed that VTRNA21-5p knockdown resulted in apoptosis of HeLa cells.
Interestingly, we also found that knockdown induced by
the exposure of cells to 50 nM VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor
increased the rate of cisplatin-induced apoptosis of cervical
cancer cells (Figure 6, Supplementary Figure S5, and
Supplementary Table S6). Cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic
drug used in cervical cancer that can induce cancer cell
apoptosis by restoring p53 functions [20, 21], and we
confirmed that it induced cervical cancer cell apoptosis in
a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure S4). We
found that approximately 22% of SiHa and 28% of HeLa
cells treated with a combination of 50 nM VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitor and 10 µM cisplatin were apoptotic, and these
values were significantly higher compared with those of
cells treated with inhibitor only (9.7% of HeLa and 10.3%
of SiHa cells) or with cisplatin only (13% of HeLa and
10.9% of SiHa cells; p < 0.05 in one-way ANOVA, n
= 5, Figure 6 and Supplementary Table S6). Therefore,

suppression of pre-miR-886 has been shown to cause
growth inhibition in HeLa and HCT116 cell lines with
high nc886 expression, whereas it has not been observed
to affect the proliferation of cell lines (H1299 and
MDA-MB435) that are nc886 deficient [11]. We further
examined the effect of VTRNA2-1-5p on the proliferation
of PC-3 cells with medium nc886 expression, and the
level of VTRNA2-1-5p in these PC-3 cells was eighteenfold lower than that in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure

did not affect cell proliferation (Supplementary Figure
S6C, p > 0.05). In addition, we found that VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitors also slightly increased apoptosis of PC-3 cells
at 48 hours (apoptosis rate: 7.8% in control vs. 12.8% in
VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor, Supplementary Figure S6D), and
this might have been caused by the PKR pathway because
the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor also down-regulated the level
of VTRNA2-1. These results provide insights into the antiapoptotic role of VTRNA2-1-5p in HeLa and PC-3 cells.
Intriguingly, the HeLa cell line expresses wild-type p53,
whereas PC-3 is p53-null, raising the question of whether
p53 also participates in the induction of apoptosis by
VTRNA2-1-5p.
We examined the mRNA and protein expression
levels of p53 during knockdown or overexpression of
VTRNA2-1-5p in three cervical cell lines (n = 3, p <
0.05, Figure 7A). The RT-PCR results showed that p53
expression was up-regulated in VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitortransfected HeLa cells and down-regulated in VTRNA21-5p-mimic transfected H8 and SiHa cells (Figure 7B
left). The Western blotting results showed that the level
of p53 protein was significantly higher in the VTRNA21-5p inhibitor-transfected cells than in the corresponding
negative controls (p = 0.03 for HeLa and p = 0.006 for
SiHa cells, n = 3; Figure 7B and 7C). The expression

levels of the p53 isoforms (p53β or p53γ; Δ40p53α) were
also elevated in VTRNA2-1-5p-inhibitor transfected
HeLa cells, whereas only p53 was elevated in VTRNA21-5p-inhibitor transfected SiHa cells (Figure 7B and
7C). Conversely, the levels of p53 and the p53β isoform
were significantly lower in the VTRNA2-1-5p mimictransfected cells than in their negative controls (p = 0.004,
p = 0.008 for H8 and p = 0.043, p = 0.029 for SiHa cells, n
= 3; Figure 7C). The levels of the isoform Δ40p53α were
also lower in the H8 cells transfected with the VTRNA21-5p mimic, whereas the expression of this isoform was
elevated in SiHa cells transfected with the VTRNA2-1-5p
mimic (Figure 7C).
We also assessed a number of p53 pathway genes,
such as p21WAF1 (p21), p14ARF (p14), MDM2, Bax and BcL2, by qRT-PCR, and these genes were searched on the
KEGG database (the primers are shown in Supplementary
Table S4). Our results showed that p53, p21, MDM2,
Bax and BcL-2 (but not p14) were up-regulated by 2.8-,
3.8-, 2.0-, 2.2-, and 1.7-fold, respectively, subsequent to
a 2-fold down-regulation of VTRNA2-1-5p in VTRNA21-5p inhibitor-transfected HeLa cells; whereas p53, p21,
p14, Bax and BcL-2 (but not MDM2) were up-regulated
by 2.9-, 2.1-, 1.9-, 2.5-, and 2.1-fold, respectively,
subsequent to a 2-fold down-regulation of VTRNA2-1-5p

control or VTRNA2-1-5p mimic for 24 hours. Expression levels of p53 and its isoforms (p53β/γ and Δ40p53) were increased in the HeLa
and SiHa cells because of VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition, which is consistent with the observed changes in mRNA expression. Conversely, the
expression levels of p53 and its isoforms (p53β/γ and Δ40p53) were decreased in the H8 cells because of the VTRNA2-1-5p mimics, which
is consistent with changes in mRNA expression. All the semi-quantitative data represent the mean±SD of three independent experiments (n

in VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor-transfected SiHa cells (n = 3,
p < 0.05; Supplementary Figure S7A). These results were
verified by Western blotting (Supplementary Figure S7B).
A 90-kDa band corresponding to MDM2 was not observed
in VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor-transfected HeLa or SiHa
cells. In the HeLa cells, p21WAF1 expression was found to
be up-regulated, with a corresponding increase in p53. In
the SiHa cells, a decrease in the smaller 14-kDa protein
band, which presumably corresponded to p21WAF1, was
observed, which is inconsistent with the observed change
in its mRNA level. We speculate that the p21 level in
SiHa cells was regulated by post-translation modification.
Transfection with the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor strongly
up-regulated the expression of p14ARF in both HeLa and
SiHa cells. The level of Bax expression also increased in
both cell lines after VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor treatment.
Bcl-2 was only detected in SiHa cells, and its level of
expression was not significantly changed by transfection
of the cells with the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor; again, this
result was not consistent with the observed changes in its
mRNA levels. Based on these findings, we speculate that

VTRNA2-1-5p down-regulates p53 expression and partly
interferes with the function of the p53 signaling pathway.

VTRNA2-1-5p directly targets p53
We adopted the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for
global alignments to investigate whether VTRNA2-1-5p
directly targets the untranslated regions (UTRs) of p53
(Figure 8A). We found that both the 5′- and 3′-UTR of
p53 possessed complementary sequences to the “seed”
sequence, although the matches were not perfect. Based
on this finding, H8 cells (a cell line with lower endogenous
VTRNA2-1-5p expression) were co-transfected with
100 ng of various p53 UTR reporters and either 40 nM
of the VTRNA2-1-5p mimic or a negative control.
Luciferase activity was reduced by approximately 2-fold
in both UTRs after co-transfection of the cells with the
VTRNA2-1-5p mimic (0.43±0.16 in the 5′-UTR and
0.32±0.16 in the 3′-UTR compared with 0.84±0.20 in
the 5′-UTR and 0.77±0.23 in the 3′-UTR in the negative
controls; p = 0.049 and p = 0.001, n = 6; Figure 7B). In

controls (0.65±0.06 and 0.42±0.02, respectively; p = 0.001
and p < 0.0001, n = 6; Figure 7C, right). Overall, these
results suggest that VTRNA2-1-5p directly targets the
transcript of p53 by interacting with its 5′-UTR and 3′UTR.
To determine whether VTRNA2-1-5p directly
targets p53 through the RISC mechanism, we sequenced
the AGO-associated RNAs by NGS sequencing. As
expected, genome mapping showed that the 5′-UTR
and 3′-UTR accounted for 20.12% and 16.22% of the
total non-coding region of the gene, respectively (Figure
9A). We also investigated the distribution of the AGO2associated RNAs in p53 mRNA. One peak with an
enrichment factor of 343.36 was mapped to the 3′-UTR,
and two peaks with enrichment factors of 64.07 and
58.83 were mapped to the 5′-UTR (Figure 9B). A base-

addition, we measured the luciferase activity in SiHa
cells (a cell line with higher endogenous VTRNA2-15p expression) upon transfection with various p53 UTR
reporters. The luciferase activities in the p53 5′-UTR-WT
and p53 3′-UTR-WT reporter groups were 0.75±0.06 and
0.62±0.07, respectively, which were significantly lower
relative to the corresponding 5′-UTR-MUT and 3′-UTRMUT controls (1.05±0.16 and 0.97±0.105, respectively;
p = 0.04 and p = 0.007, n = 6, Figure 7C, left) because
of the presence of endogenous VTRNA2-1-5p. We also
co-transfected cells with 40 nM of the VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitor and 100 ng of the various p53 UTR reporters
and observed that the luciferase activity of both the p53
5′-UTR-WT reporter (0.87±0.06) and the p53 3′-UTR-WT
reporter (0.90±0.08) was significantly up-regulated by
VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition relative to that of the negative

pair resolution peak analysis showed enrichment of the
AGO2-associated RNA fragments in multiple regions of
p53 mRNA (Figure 9C), including the region between
nucleotides 1738 and 1746 (the region containing a
potential binding site for the miRNA-150 seed), the region
between nucleotides 1899 and 1907 (the potential binding
site for let-7), the region between nucleotides 2050 and
2057, and the potential binding site for miRNA-22-3p.
In addition, the potential VTRNA2-1-5p binding site (the
region between nucleotides 2146 and 2154 in p53 mRNA)
was also highly enriched in the AGO-associated RNAs.
The above results indicate that VTRNA2-1-5p directly
targets the UTR region of p53 mRNA.

dependent PKR. Activation of PKR by dsRNA induces
the expression of proapoptotic genes of the tumor necrosis
factor receptor family, including Fas and proapoptotic
Bax [33]. PKR exhibits affinities for dsRNAs of various
sizes, and molecules shorter than 30 bp fail to bind stably
[34]. Until now, the best-characterized role of nc886 has
been its binding to PKR and inhibition of PKR activity.
Our data show that VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition provoked
apoptosis in HeLa, a cell line with high endogenous nc886
expression, and in PC-3, a cell line with low endogenous
nc886 expression. However, Lee et al. reported that
nc886 inhibition did not affect proliferation in two nc886deficient cell lines, H1299 and MDA-MB435. Clearly,
nc886 is a critical anti-apoptosis factor in cancer cells.
The apoptosis induced by VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition in
HeLa and PC-3 cells was likely partly induced through
the PKR mechanism because VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition
also decreased VTRNA2-1 levels. Our hypothesis is that
VTRNA2-1-5p is the mature form of nc886. Obviously,
VTRNA2-1-5p cannot bind PKR because of its singlestranded nature and size. However, the role of VTRNA21-5p in apoptosis and proliferation remains unclear.
Our data show that VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition promoted
apoptosis in p53-wild HeLa more effectively than in p53null PC-3 cells; thus, we cannot rule out the possibility
that VTRNA2-1-5p might also interact directly with
other molecules, such as p53, which is regarded as a
classic pro-apoptotic molecule. In addition, VTRNA2-15p overexpression, which did not impact the expression
of VTRNA2-1, promoted the growth of SiHa and HeLa
by up-regulating p53 levels, whereas VTRNA2-1-5p
overexpression did not affect the growth of p53-null PC3
cells.
A number of studies have demonstrated the
importance of the p53 signaling pathway. The p53 gene
is often mutated in human cancers, and this mutation is
found in approximately 23% of all breast cancer samples,
where it is the second most frequently mutated gene
[35]. Hence, mutant p53 is believed to be the driving
oncogene in breast cancer [36]. HPV-positive cervical
carcinoma cells usually possess the wild-type p53 gene
without mutations, whereas the p53 protein is inactivated
in these cells [37]. Our data showed strong p53 staining in
breast cancer tissue and weak staining in cervical cancer
tissue, a finding that is consistent with the literature [38].
Down-regulation of p53 levels is thought to be a key
mechanism in cervical cancer carcinogenesis. HPV has
been identified as an etiological agent involved in the
pathogenesis of most cervical cancers. The so-called highrisk HPV types lead to the expression of E6 oncoproteins
that bind to p53 and promote p53 degradation through
an ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis system [37]. In this
work, we found that VTRNA2-1-5p was highly expressed
in cervical cancer cells; however, studies have indicated
that most malignancies, including those of MDA-MB-231
(breast), HeLa (cervix), and HCT116 (colon) cell lines,

DISCUSSION
In this work, we were unable to rule out the presence
of VTRNA2-1-5p in cervical tissue because we captured
its sequence with a stem-loop structure from stem-loop
qPCR products through sequencing. Mature miR-886-3p
has been detected by Northern blotting in HS5, a human
stromal cell line [23], and mature forms from VRNA21 are suggested to display tissue specificity. Moreover,
we cannot rule out an miRNA-like functional role for
VRNA2-1 in cervical cancer because our experiments
showed that the expression levels of the most predicted
targets of VTRNA2-1-5p were negatively correlated with
the expression of VTRNA2-1-5p. Vault RNAs have been
reported to be involved in resistance to chemotherapeutic
drugs and are known to produce microRNAs through a
Dicer-dependent mechanism; these microRNAs then
operate in a similar manner to regular miRNA [24]. The
small RNA from VTRNA1-1 (hvg-1) binds an AGO
protein and down-regulates the expression of CYP3A4,
an enzyme involved in drug metabolism [25]. Interactions
between RNA derived from VTRNA1-2 (hvg-2) and three
anti-tumor drugs have also been reported [26]. Consistent
with these reports, we found that VTRNA2-1-5p was
enriched in the anti-AGO2 immunoprecipitation complex,
which indicates that VTRNA2-1-5p is processed by the
RISC mechanism. However, we only found a minute
amount of VTRNA2-1-5p in cervical tissues and cells that
was too small for detection by Northern blotting. Hence,
we used stem-loop qPCR to quantify the expression of
VTRNA2-1-5p.
A series of reports have shown that nc886 is
a tumor-suppressing ncRNA in human esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) [27], gastric cancer
[22], cholangiocarcinoma [28] and other cancers.
In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and lung cancer,
hypermethylation of the nc886 promoter results in
abolished expression, which eliminates the inhibitory
effect [29, 30]. The genomic locus of nc886 on human
chromosome 5q31 is frequently deleted in leukemia [31,
32]. Tumor surveillance by nc886 is based on its ability
to bind and repress the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

lack pre-miR-886 [11]. We also observed VTRNA2-1-5p
expression in breast cancer tissues, whereas a significant
difference in VTRNA2-1-5p expression was not observed
in normal para-cancerous tissues and cancerous tissues.
These findings demonstrate that VTRNA2-1-5p has
a specific biological role in cervical cancers. In vitro
experiments, VTRNA2-1-5p was shown to be involved
in the down-regulation of p53 mRNA and protein levels
for various p53 isoforms. To date, 12 distinct isoforms of
p53 have been reported, and they are produced through
alternative initiation of translation and alternative splicing
[39, 40]. Isoforms of p53, p53β, p53γ, Δ133p53α,
Δ133p53β, and Δ133p53γ have been detected in certain
tumors and normal tissue [41]. The levels of a number of
the wild-type p53 isoforms, such as FLp53, p53β, p53γ,
and Δ40p53, were found to be low in HeLa, SiHa, and
H8 cells because of the presence of the E6-ubiquitindependent proteolysis system. SiHa cells contain only one
copy of HPV 16 DNA per cell and have higher levels of
wild-type p53 than HeLa cells, which have 25 copies of
HPV 18 DNA per cell [42].
We propose that VTRNA2-1-5p directly targets p53
UTRs and inhibits p53 transcription and translation. The
results obtained using the luciferase report systems suggest
that VTRNA2-1-5p targeted the transcript of p53 directly
by interacting with its 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR. In addition,
a RIP assay showed that potential VTRNA2-1-5p target
sites in the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR region of p53 mRNA were
enriched in the anti-AGO2 immunoprecipitation complex,
although the enrichment of the 5′-UTR region was lower
than that of the 3′-UTR region. This result might have
been caused by the unique spatial structure that has been
reported, i.e., the presence of a dsRNA region containing
complementary sequences to the 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of
human p53 mRNA [43]. The length of the 3′-UTR of p53
mRNA (1206 bp), which contributes to the binding of
the probe, is another possible explanation. Unfortunately,
experiments that might demonstrate a direct interaction
between VTRNA2-1-5p and p53 UTRs, such as RNase
protection assays, are difficult to implement because of the
minute amount of VTRNA2-1-5p in the cells.
We have also demonstrated that VTRNA2-1-5p
down-regulated Bax [6] and p14ARF, showing that it affects
the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells by targeting multiple
molecules. It is well known that p21, p14, MDM2, Bax
and BcL-2 are key downstream signaling molecules
in the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway. In our study,
p21WAF1, a downstream effector of p53, was shown to be
up-regulated by p53 [44]. However, we also detected a
small 14-kDa band that reacted with the p21WAF1 antibody,
and the levels of this band decreased with increasing
levels of p53 in SiHa cells. Huang et al. showed that this
smaller 14-kDa band might be a cleaved form of p21WAF1
and suggested that its decrease could play an important
role in p53-dependent apoptosis [45]. The expression of
p14ARF in HeLa and SiHa cells was found to be strongly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

up-regulated by the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor. Studies have
indicated that p14ARF may activate the p53 pathway by
interacting with and inhibiting the ubiquitin ligase activity
of MDM2 [46]. With the exception of p53 and Bax, the
p53 downstream signals measured here did not show
synchronous changes in mRNA and protein levels in two
separate cell lines. Therefore, we support the hypothesis
that VTRNA2-1-5p directly targets p53 and indirectly
targets multiple molecules in the p53 pathway. However,
it is still not clear whether changes in the expression of
VTRNA2-1-5p are induced by HPV proteins. Thus,
possible links between HPV proteins and VTRNA2-1-5p
expression deserve further investigation.
In summary, we have identified a link between
VTRNA2-1-5p and p53 in cervical cancer cells. We also
found that VTRNA2-1-5p inhibition reduced cervical
cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These findings
support the idea that VTRNA2-1-5p plays an important
role in the apoptosis of cervical cancer cells and suggest
that VTRNA2-1-5p may be a potential target in the
treatment of cervical cancer.

Cell Bank (Shanghai, China). The HPV 16-immortalized
human cervical mucosal epithelial cell line H8 was
purchased from the Cell Center of Peking Union Medical
University (Beijing, China). This cell line is derived from
normal squamous cervical epithelium [47]. The cells
were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator in DMEM
supplemented with 100 µg/mL streptomycin, 100 units/
mL penicillin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), and
they were routinely passaged in 2- to 3-day intervals. The
characteristics of the three cell lines used in this work are
summarized in Supplementary Table S2.
The isolation of miRNA from tissues and cell lines
was performed using a mirVana™ miRNA Isolation
Kit (AM1561). Briefly, the sample was first lysed in a
denaturing lysis solution, and the lysate was then extracted
with acidic phenol:chloroform, which removes most of the
cellular components and yields a semi-pure RNA sample.
The sample was further purified over a glass-fiber filter
by special procedures to yield a size fraction enriched in
miRNAs. The glass-fiber filter procedure used solutions
formulated specifically for miRNA retention to avoid the
loss of small RNAs, which typically occurs with glassfiber filter methods.
Northern blotting was conducted using the High
Sensitive MiRNA Northern Blot Assay Kit (Signosis,
NB-1001). The probes for the Northern blotting analysis
were purchased from WuHan Zhongzhi Biotechnologies
Co. Ltd. (WuHan, China), and the sequences of the
probes are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Briefly,
2 μg of each miRNA-enriched sample was run on a
15% polyacrylamide/8 M urea denaturing gel and
electrophoretically transferred to a nylon membrane
(Signosis, NB-1001) at 0.2 A for 1 hour. After transfer,
the RNA was immobilized by Stratagene UV cross-linking
and then hybridized to the probe at 42°C overnight in NB
hybridization buffer (Signosis). The membranes were
washed twice at 42°C in NB hybridization wash buffer
and once in 1× detection wash buffer. After blocking the
membrane with 15 ml of blocking buffer for 30 minutes at
room temperature, streptavidin-HRP conjugate was added
to the blot incubation solution and maintained for 45
minutes. The membranes were washed three times before
adding substrates A and B, and they were then exposed to
a Fujifilm LAS3000 Imager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan).

ISH was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions using a miRCURY LNA™ microRNA ISH
optimization kit (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark). The details
of this procedure are provided in Supplementary Methods
1. Single 3′-digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled miRCURY LNA
detection probes (Exiqon) were used, and the sequences
of these probes are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The
snRNA U6 probe was used as a positive control and miR159 was used as a negative control in all the experiments.
VTRNA2-1-5p expression was assessed using an Aperio
ImageScope v11.1.2.752 (Aperio Technologies), with
three sites per spot. The expression levels were classified
into four groups: (0) < 1% positive area; (1) 1% to 25%
positive area; (2) 26% to 50% positive area; (3) 51%
to 75% positive area; and (4) > 75% positive area. The
intensity of staining was scored as 1, 2, 3 or 4, which
represented negative, weak, moderate, and strong staining,
respectively.
To perform IHC, paraffin-embedded tissue samples
were cut into 4-µm-thick sections and pretreated at 65°C
for 2 hours followed by deparaffinization in xylene
and rehydration through decreasing grades of ethanol.
Antigens were retrieved prior to the application of the
primary antibody (anti-p53 antibody, #9282, CST, 1:50)
overnight at 4°C. As a negative control, sections were
incubated with PBS, and the slides were then incubated
with a secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish
peroxidase (HRP, 1:100; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) for
2 hours at room temperature. HRP activity was detected
using the Super Vision method (SV). In each case, more
than ten visual fields were observed or more than 1000
cells were counted per slide, and p53 protein expression
was represented by a positive index corresponding to the
number of p53-positive cells per 1000 cells.

Total RNA was extracted from the cervical cancer
cell lines using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA,
USA). Each reverse transcriptase reaction contained a
total of 0.5 µg RNA, 50 nM stem-loop RT primer, 1×RT
buffer, 0.25 mM each of dNTPs, 3.33 U/mL MultiScribe
reverse transcriptase, and 0.25 U/mL RNase inhibitor.
The 10 µL reaction mixtures were incubated for 30
minutes at 16°C, 30 minutes at 42°C, and 5 minutes at
85°C and then held at 4°C. All the reverse transcriptase
reactions, including no-template controls and RT
minus controls, were run in duplicate. The stem-loop
primers were 5’ - GTCGTATCCAGTGCAGGGTCC
GAGGTATTCGCACTGGATACGACCCGCTT - 3′

All the quantitative real-time PCR assays were
performed using an MX3000P real-time RT-PCR system
and a Brilliant II SYBR® Green Q-PCR Master Mix
kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), with RNA inputs
normalized to the level of human U6 snRNA. The
sequences of the forward and reverse primers for human
VTRNA2-1-5p were 5′- CGGGTCGGAGTTAGCTCA-3′

5′-TGCGAATACCTCGGACCCTG-3′,
respectively, and those for human U6 snRNA were
5′-ATTGGAACGATACAGAGAAGATT-3′

respectively.
Amplification was conducted for 10 minutes at 95°C
followed by 40 cycles of 15 seconds at 95°C and 1 minute
at 60°C. All the reactions were run in triplicate.

Transfected HeLa cells and SiHa cells were selected
for 1 week in the presence of the antibiotic G418, and
then, 1000 selected GFP-positive cells were plated in
10-cm dishes to assess the effects of transfection on
their ability to form colonies after 10 days of incubation
at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. At 24, 48, and 72 hours
after transfection, the cells were harvested for the MTT
assays, which were performed as previously described
[48]. The cell viability (% of mock) was calculated as the
absorbance of NC or In/absorbance of mock × 100%. All
the experiments were repeated three times.

In vitro invasion assays
Cell invasion was assessed using 24-well BD
Falcon™ cell culture inserts with 8-µm pores (BD
Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Transwell membranes coated
with Matrigel®(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA) were used to evaluate the invasive capabilities of
the transfected HeLa and SiHa cells. The cells in eight
randomly selected visual fields of each membrane were
counted. In all experiments, the data were collected from
three chambers.

Cell apoptosis assay
Apoptosis assays were performed on HeLa and
SiHa cells 24 hours after transfection using an Annexin
V-PE apoptosis detection kit (Beyotime Institute of
Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) and analyzed by FACS.

Luciferase reporter assay

Chemically synthesized VTRNA2-1-5p RNA
mimics and inhibitors were obtained from Invitrogen
(Carlsbad, CA, USA), and their sequences, as well as those
of the negative controls, are provided in Supplementary
Table S3. The siRNA-expressing plasmids used to inhibit
the expression of VTRNA2-1-5p were purchased from
Shanghai GenePharma (Shanghai, China).
The cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000
reagent (Invitrogen) at approximately 70-90% confluence.
Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the transfection
complexes were prepared and added directly to the
cervical cancer cell cultures at a final oligonucleotide
concentration of 50 nmol/L. To establish stable VTRNA21-5p knockdown SiHa lines, SiHa cells were stably
transfected with a plasmid expressing a VTRNA2-1-5p
inhibitor or with a control plasmid. After transfection,
SiHa cells were selected in the presence of G418.

The 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR of p53 and related mutant
luciferase reporter plasmids were constructed based on
the pmirGLO vector (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA,
USA). Mutations of the p53 5′-UTR-WT and p53 3′-UTRWT sequences were created using a Quick-Change sitedirected mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The details of
the plasmid construction technique are presented in
Supplementary Materials and Methods.
For the purpose of the assay, the cells were
transfected with firefly luciferase reporter vectors in 96well plates using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The
transfection mixtures contained 100 ng of the firefly
luciferase reporter plasmid and 40 nM of a synthetic
VTRNA2-1-5p mimic or inhibitor in a total volume 20
µl. The cells were collected 24 hours after transfection,
and luciferase activity was measured using the Promega
Dual-Luciferase™ reporter assay system. Luminescence

(PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT, USA) with Wallac EnVision
Manager software version 1.11. The cells were transfected
in triplicate wells, and the experiments were repeated three
times.

Because of the magnitude and range of the relative
miRNA expression levels observed in the experiments,
nonparametric tests were performed. All the tests were
two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant.

Western blot analysis

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The cells were lysed in RIPA lysis buffer (Sigma)
with protease inhibitors, and the protein concentration
of the extracts was measured using a BCA assay (Pierce,
Rockford, IL, USA). The membranes were incubated
overnight at 4°C with antibodies to p53 (#9282, 1:500),
p14 (#2407, 1:1000), p21 (#2947, 1:800), Bax (#2774,
1:1000), and Bcl-2 (#2876, 1:800), which were obtained
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA), and
antibodies to MDM2 (sc-965, 1:500), which were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).
HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG was
diluted to 1:8000. The membranes were developed using
an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare,
Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, UK) and then exposed
to a Fujifilm LAS3000 Imager (Fuji, Tokyo, Japan). The
Western blots were evaluated by densitometry using
ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD, USA). The protein
amounts were normalized to that of β-actin (#4967, Cell
Signaling Technology; Beverly, MA, USA).

Six-week-old female nude mice (BALB/cnude) (animal ethics number 2012-X-109) were used
to investigate tumorigenicity. Stable VTRNA2-1-5p
knockdown or control vector SiHa cells were grown, and
mice were s.c. inoculated in the dorsal flank with 6×106
cells (five animals for the mock, five for the control vector,
and five for the VTRNA2-1-5p inhibitor). The tumor size
was measured each week, and the tumor volume was
calculated as follows:
Tumor volume (mm3) = Length×(width)2/2 [49].
For end-point experiments, the animals were
perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde under deep anesthesia
and sacrificed two weeks after tumor cell injection, and the
tumors were then removed and weighed. The neoplastic
nature of the tumors was confirmed by histological
examination.
