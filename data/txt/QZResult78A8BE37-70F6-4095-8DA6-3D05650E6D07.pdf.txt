Abstract
Although the prognosis for clinically localized prostate cancer is now favorable, there are still no curative
treatments for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and, therefore, it remains fatal. In this study, we
investigate a new therapeutic approach for treatment of CRPC, which involves dual targeting of a major signaling
pathway that is frequently deregulated in the disease. We found that dual targeting of the Akt and mTOR signaling
pathways with their respective inhibitors, MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669), is highly effective for inhibiting
CRPC in preclinical studies in vivo using a reﬁned genetically engineered mouse model of the disease. The efﬁcacy
of the combination treatment contrasts with their limited efﬁcacy as single agents, since delivery of MK-2206 or
MK-8669 individually had a modest impact in vivo on the overall tumor phenotype. In human prostate cancer cell
lines, although not in the mouse model, the synergistic actions of MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669) are due
in part to limiting the mTORC2 feedback activation of Akt. Moreover, the effects of these drugs are mediated by
inhibition of cellular proliferation via the retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway. Our ﬁndings suggest that dual targeting of
the Akt and mTOR signaling pathways using MK-2206 and ridaforolimus (MK-8669) may be effective for
treatment of CRPC, particularly for patients with deregulated Rb pathway activity. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4483–93.

Introduction
All aspects of prostate development and function require
androgen signaling, which is mediated by the androgen receptor, a nuclear steroid receptor (1, 2). Moreover, prostate cancer
arises under the inﬂuence of androgen receptor signaling,
whereas removal of androgens via androgen deprivation therapy is the most common ﬁrst-line treatment for recurrent
prostate tumors. However, in most cases, androgen deprivation therapy ultimately results in the emergence of a highly
aggressive form of the disease, which is now referred to as
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) to reﬂect its
continued dependence on androgen receptor in the absence
of testicular androgens (3). Among available therapeutic
approaches for treatment of CRPC, conventional chemotherapy has limited efﬁcacy (4–6). Recently, several agents that

target androgen receptor and/or androgen synthesis, namely
MDV3100 and Abiraterone, have been introduced into the
clinic and have shown promising results (7, 8), although they
are also not curative.
An alternative approach is targeted therapy directed against
signaling pathways that are active in CRPC, including the Akt/
mTOR signaling axis. Indeed, the culmination of several lines of
evidence, including analyses of tissue microarrays (9–11),
oncogenomic analyses of human clinical data (12), and functional studies in mouse and human prostate cancer cells
(9, 13, 14), have established that activation of Akt/mTOR
signaling is strongly and causally associated with advanced
prostate tumors and particularly CRPC. Nonetheless, despite
the relevance of Akt/mTOR pathway deregulation for disease
progression and the availability of suitable therapeutic agents,
targeting these pathways using single agents has not been
effective in clinical settings (15, 16), although there are notable
exceptions (17). It is widely believed that this may be due in part
to feedback activation of these pathways, which occurs in
response to drug treatment (18–21).
Therefore, we have now investigated the consequences of
dual targeting of Akt/mTOR signaling in CRPC. By analyses of
preclinical studies in vivo using genetically-engineered mouse
(GEM) models, we show that combinatorial treatment using
MK-2206 to target Akt and ridaforolimus (MK-8669) to target
mTOR is highly effective for inhibition of CRPC. Parallel studies
of human prostate cancer cell lines in culture revealed that the
mechanism of action is via inhibition of cellular proliferation
mediated by the retinoblastoma (Rb) signaling pathway.

Considering the importance of Rb status for progression to
CRPC (12, 22) as well as response to therapy (23), our ﬁndings
suggest that dual inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling with MK2206 and MK-8669 may be a promising approach for treatment
of patients with CRPC, particularly those with deregulated Rb
signaling.

Materials and Methods
Generation and analysis of GEM models
All experiments using animals were conducted according to
protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee at Columbia University Medical Center (New York,
NY). The Nkx3.1CreERT2/þ allele, which is null for Nkx3.1,
expresses Cre-ERT2 under the control of the Nkx3.1 promoter
(24). The conditional allele for Pten (Ptenﬂox/ﬂox) having loxP
sites ﬂanking exon 5 (25) was obtained from the National
Cancer Institute Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium.
Mice were breed to generate the full spectrum of genotypic
combinations. Primers for genotyping are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
For induction of Cre activity, tamoxifen (Sigma Cat #T5648;
or corn oil alone) was delivered by i.p. injection (225 mg/kg)
or oral gavage (100 mg/kg) for 4 consecutive days, to mice at 2
to 3 months of age. Mice were androgen ablated by surgical
castration at 4 months after tamoxifen. For phenotypic analyses, mice were sacriﬁced, the prostatic lobes (anterior,
dorsolateral, and ventral) were collected individually and the
weights determined. Tissues were ﬁxed in 10% formalin,
cyropreserved in optimal cutting temperature (OCT) compound, or snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Immunohistochemical staining was done on 3 mm parafﬁn sections as described previously (9) using an Intellipath FLX from Biocare Medical and visualized using a
Nikon Eclipse E800 microscope equipped with a Nikon
DXM1200 digital camera. Quantiﬁcation of proliferating
cells was done as described previously (26), using 5 independent sections from 5 independent mice (i.e., 25 sections). SA b-galactosidase staining was done on tissues
embedded directly in OCT (without prior ﬁxation) as in
ref. 27. Western blot analyses were done using total protein
extracts obtained by sonicating mouse prostate tissue or
human prostate cell in 1 radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer [0.1% SDS, 1.0% deoxycolate–sodium Salt, 1.0% Triton
X-100, 0.15 M NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L
EDTA] containing fresh 1% protease inhibitor (#1697498,
Roche) and 1% phosphatase inhibitor (#P2850, SigmaAldrich). Details of all antibodies are provided in Supplementary Table S2.
Real-time PCR was done on total RNA using the Quantitech
SYBR Green PCR kit (Qiagen). A pairwise ﬁxed reallocation
randomization test using the relative expression software tool
(Qiagen) was used to test the signiﬁcance of the expression
ratios of transcripts. Primers are listed in Supplementary Table
S1. Statistical analyses were conducted using a 2-tailed t test, c2
test, or Fisher's exact test as appropriate. GraphPad Prism
software (version 5.0) was used for all statistical analysis and to
generate data plots.

Preclinical analyses of GEM
MK-2206 and MK-8669 were obtained from Merck. MK-2206
was dissolved in 30% captisol (Cydex) in sterile water to make a
working stock of 20 mg/mL and delivered via oral gavage at 120
mg/kg. MK-8669 was dissolved in 100% ethanol to make a
working stock of 25 mg/mL, and then diluted to 1.25 mg/mL in
a solution of 5.2% Tween 80, 5.2% PEG400 in sterile water, and
delivered via i.p. at 10 mg/kg. Docetaxel was purchased from
LC Labs and delivered at 10 mg/kg in a vehicle solution of 23%
Tween 80 in 1 PBS. The optimal dosage of each of the drug
was determined by delivering varied amounts of drug over a
period of 1 month to mice of the same strain and genotypic
background used for the preclinical studies, and selecting the
maximal tolerated dose. The starting point for these dosage
studies was the information provided by the supplier (Merck).
The MK-2206 and/or MK-8669 (or vehicle) were delivered 3
times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) and docetaxel
was delivered twice a week (Tuesday and Friday) for a period of
2 months. For the short-term therapeutic response group,
agents were delivered once a day for 5 consecutive days, and
mice were dissected 6 hours after last treatment. Mice were
weighed daily and observed for signs of distress following
dosing; none of the treatments resulted in appreciable weight
loss exceeding 10%.
Computational analyses of expression proﬁling data
Gene expression proﬁling analysis was done using total RNA
isolated form phenotypically wild-type (intact) Nkx3.1CE2/þ
(n ¼ 3), intact Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f (n ¼ 6), and castrated
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f (n ¼ 6). RNA was isolated using the MagMAX-96 total RNA isolation kit (Ambion), which was reverse
transcribed and biotin labeled using the Illumina TotalPrep
RNA Ampliﬁcation Kit (Ambion). The cRNA (1.5 mg) was
hybridized on mouseWG-6 v2 BeadArrays (Illumina) using an
iScan BeadArray scanner (Illumina). Data were loaded and
normalized using IlluminaExpressionFileCreator version 2
and Illumina normalizer with collapse mode using the maximum of all the probe values for each gene and without
background subtraction. The resulting datasets were preprocessed to remove probesets whose difference between maximum and minimum values were less than 100. Data were log
transformed for GSEA analysis (GEO: GSE39054).
Gene signatures comparing the intact wild type (Nkx3.1CE2/þ)
to the intact and castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f were deﬁned
using the Welch t-test to identify genes ranked by their differential expression in the intact and castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f
mouse prostate tumors versus the phenotypically wild-type
(Nkx3.1CE2/þ) mouse prostate, respectively. To identify pathways
commonly deregulated in intact and castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ;
Ptenf/f prostate tumors, enrichment of these differentially
expressed gene signatures in human pathways was evaluated
using gene set enrichment analyses (GSEA; ref. 28) using pathways collected in the c2 curated gene sets (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) with 1,000 gene label
permutations (gene sets). Signiﬁcantly enriched gene sets,
deﬁned by nominal P < 0.05, were compared between intact
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f versus Nkx3.1CE2/þ and castrated intact
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f versus Nkx3.1CE2/þ gene signatures.

A reﬁned mouse model of CRPC
Among the genes that are known to be causally associated
with prostate tumorigenesis are: (i) the Nkx3.1 homeobox gene,
which is speciﬁcally expressed in the prostatic epithelium and
its reduced expression associated with prostatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PIN; refs. 1, 31); and (ii) the Pten tumor suppressor,
whose loss-of-function is associated with tumor promotion via
activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling
pathway (1, 32, 33). Previously, we showed that germline
loss-of-function of Pten and Nkx3.1 leads to CRPC following
surgical castration (34, 35), and other groups have shown that
conditional loss-of-function of Pten in prostate also leads to
CRPC (36–39). Indeed, several lines of evidence now support a
causal role for Pten loss-of-function in the transition to CRPC
(13, 39, 40), and therefore highlight the importance of using
GEM models having Pten inactivation to study CRPC in vivo.
However, germline loss of Pten results in tumors in many sites
other than prostate, whereas most of the conditional deletion
models reported thus far have used a constitutively active
Probasin-Cre transgene (PB-Cre4), which leads to recombination (deletion) in the prostate before complete maturation (41).
In the current study, we produced a reﬁned GEM model of
Pten-induced castration resistance by deleting Pten speciﬁcally
in the prostatic epithelium of adult mice using a tamoxifeninducible (rather than constitutively active) Cre under the
control of the Nkx3.1 promoter (24). This Nkx3.1CreERT2
knock-in allele simultaneously inactivates 1 allele of Nkx3.1
[which is haploinsufﬁcient in prostate cancer (1, 31)] while
driving tamoxifen-dependent Cre–mediated recombination
speciﬁcally in prostate epithelium, including in a relevant cell
of origin of prostate cancer (24). This Nkx3.1CreERT2 allele was
crossed with a Pten conditional allele (25) to obtain the
Nkx3.1CreERT2/þ; Ptenﬂox/ﬂox mice used in these studies (hereafter denoted Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f ). Importantly, Pten recombination was induced via tamoxifen activation of Cre in adult
mice at 2 months of age, which is subsequent to when the

PC3 (CRL-1435) and LNCaP (CRL-1740) cells were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were
used within 6 months of their receipt; veriﬁcation of the cell
lines was done by ATCC. Cells were grown in a RPMI medium
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and
100 U/mL penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were treated with
vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) or with MK-2206 (1 mM) and/or
MK-8669 (1 nmol/L) for 24 to 96 hours (as indicated). Where
indicated, 12.5 nmol/L siRNA or control siRNA (Ambion) was

(Invitrogen). All cell culture assays were done in at least 3
independent experiments. Comparison of differences among

prostate and other male secondary sexual organs are fully
mature. In control experiments, we have shown that this
temporally limited induction with tamoxifen has little or no
effect on the prostate phenotype of control or mutant mice
(24).
The Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice, but not the control mice
(Nkx3.1CE2/þ), developed PIN lesions as early as 6 to 7 months
after tamoxifen induction, which by 9 to 12 months progressed
to high-grade PIN (N ¼ 8/8 mice) and by 16 months to extensive
high-grade PIN with areas of invasion (N ¼ 8/8 mice; Fig. 1A–
E; Table 1). Pathological evaluation of these lesions using the
classiﬁcation of Park and colleagues (42) revealed that mouse
tumors displayed extensive PIN III and PIN IV (i.e., high-grade
PIN) with areas of squamous metaplasia, found in some GEM
models of prostate cancer.
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice that have undergone depletion of
androgens by surgical castration initially display tumor regression (N ¼ 4/4 mice), which is evident by 2 weeks following
castration (Fig. 1I–L). However, this initial regression was
followed by the emergence of castration-resistant lesions
that resembled high-grade PIN by 6 to 7 months after tamoxifen induction (N ¼ 14/14 mice); these lesions progressed
to high-grade PIN with adenocarcinoma by 12 months and
to extensive, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma by 16
months following tamoxifen induction (N ¼ 14/14 mice; Fig.
1F–H; Table 1). Pathological evaluation of these lesions (42)
revealed that these tumors displayed extensive PIN IV (N ¼ 14/

by 12 months following tumor induction, whereas the older
mice (i.e., 16 months) displayed extensive microinvasive adenocarcinoma, which was not evident in the noncastrated mice
(N ¼ 14/14 mice; Table 1). Therefore, the Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f
mice are initially sensitive to castration as has been reported
previously for Pten inactivation in other GEM models (34, 36)
but ultimately develop castration-resistant tumors that are
histologically more advanced than the intact mice.
Notably, although the castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice had
a more severe phenotype, immunochemical analyses revealed
that the lesions arising in prostates from the intact and
castrated mice were otherwise more similar than they were
different (Fig. 2). In particular, the prostatic lesions in both the
intact and castrated mice expressed robust levels of androgen
receptor, which was mainly nuclear (n ¼ 5; Fig. 2A and B). These
prostatic lesions were primarily luminal, as evident from the
robust expression of cytokeratin (CK) 8, a marker of luminal
epithelium, although the prostatic lesions from the castrated
mice displayed an approximately 5-fold increase in the basal
cells, evident from expression of CK5, a basal cell marker (n ¼
5; Fig. 2C–F and Q). Furthermore, both the intact and castrated
prostates were similarly highly proliferative (12%–14%) as
evident by Ki67 staining (n ¼ 5; Fig. 2G and H; Table 1). Finally,
the prostatic lesions in both the intact and castrated mice
displayed strong activation of Akt and mTOR signaling, as

4486

Cancer Res; 72(17) September 1, 2012

evident by the immunostaining for p-Akt and p-S6, respectively,
as well as by Western blot analyses (Fig. 2I–L and Q).
Nonetheless, lesions arising in prostates of castrated
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice were consistently more advanced
than those of the age-matched intact Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice
(Fig. 1; Table 1). Interestingly, this was accompanied by
decreased expression of senescence-associated (SA)-b-galactosidase (SA-b-gal). In particular, although prostates from the
intact Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice expressed high levels of SAb-gal, as has been reported previously for other prostate cancer
models having inactivation of Pten (27), SA-b-gal expression
was barely detectable in prostates from the castrated
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f prostate (Fig. 2M–P). Notably, this striking
difference in SA-b-gal expression was observed in mice at 7
months following tumor induction (3 months after
castration; Fig. 2M and N), when both the intact and castrated
mice display a similar histopathology (see Fig. 1, Table 1),
indicating that this difference is not due to the more advanced
nature of the castrated tumors. These ﬁndings raise the
interesting possibility that castration resistance is associated
with a bypass of the senescence phenotype, which may contribute to cancer progression.
Computational analyses using gene expression proﬁling
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4) supports our observations
from these phenotypic analyses that the prostate tumors from

Targeting Akt/mTOR in Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer

intact and castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice are more similar
than they are different. In particular, using GSEA (28) to
identify relevant biological processes, we found that about
50% of biological pathways were similarly deregulated in
prostates of both intact and castrated mice (Fig. 2R; Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Among the pathways that were
similarly deregulated between the intact and castrated
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f prostate tumors were the NF-kB signaling,
which is an indicator of the relative levels of inﬂammation, and
the p53 pathway, which has been associated with abrogating
the senescence phenotype following Pten inactivation (ref. 27;
Supplementary Tables S6 and S7). Therefore, both the phenotypic and molecular features of the intact and castrated
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mouse prostate tumors support the fact
that they are highly similar.
Interestingly, the notable exception to this overall similarity was deregulation of a senescence signature (P < 0.001),
which was only observed in the intact prostate (Fig. 2S),
consistent with our phenotypic observation (Fig. 2M–P).
Taken together, these ﬁndings further support a critical role
for Pten loss-of-function for castration resistance and suggest
that the transition to castration resistance is associated with
alleviation of the senescence phenotype, which may contribute to the more aggressive phenotype of castrate-resistant
tumors.
Combination targeted therapy inhibits CRPC
Although in general, targeted therapy using single agents
directed against Akt/mTOR signaling has had limited efﬁcacy
in clinical contexts (15, 16), their actions as combined agents
has shown some promise, including in prostate cancer cells
(43). Given the robust activation of Akt and mTOR signaling in
these mouse tumors (see Fig. 2I–L), we considered that the
castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice are well suited to evaluate
the consequences of combinatorial targeting these signaling
pathways for inhibition of CRPC. To do so, we used a speciﬁc
non ATP-competitive allosteric Akt inhibitor, MK-2206, that
is highly effective for inhibiting Akt function in various
in vivo and cellular contexts (17, 44, 45). We combined this
Akt inhibitor with an mTOR inhibitor, MK-8669 (ridaforolimus, formerly termed deforolimus), an analog of rapamycin
speciﬁc for the mTORC1 complex (11). Both of these agents
have been evaluated in clinical trials where they have been
shown to be effective and well tolerated (17, 46–48), and the
combination is currently being tested in a Phase I trial
(clinicaltrials.gov #NCT01295632). Notably, we veriﬁed that
each of these agents inhibited their respective pathways in
the mouse prostate in vivo when delivered individually or in
combination (Fig. 3G–P and V), and were well tolerated for
the duration of the treatment period when delivered at their
effective doses.
Thus, we conducted preclinical studies in the intact or
castrated Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice by administering MK2206 and/or MK-8669 for 2 months, following which the mice
were sacriﬁced for analysis (Fig. 3A; Supplementary Fig. S1 and
Supplementary Table S3). Treatment with either MK-2206 or
MK-8669 alone had a modest impact on the overall tumor
phenotype considering multiple endpoints (see below),

www.aacrjournals.org

although MK-8669 signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation (Table
2). In striking contrast, the combination of MK-2206 þ MK8669 was highly effective for inhibiting castration-resistant
tumors (Fig. 3 and Table 2). This was evident by analyses of
several independent endpoints, including: (i) a profound alteration in histologic phenotype (Fig. 3B–F); (ii) a 13-fold reduction in tumor weight (P ¼ 0.004; Table 2); (iii) a signiﬁcant (3fold) reduction in cellular proliferation (P < 0.001; Fig. 3Q–
U, Table 2); and (iv) attenuated expression of the relevant
pathway markers, namely p-Akt and p-S6 (Fig. 3G–P and V).
Notably, MK-2206 þ MK-8669 had only a modest effect on the
tumor phenotype in the intact Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f mice as
evident by the more limited effect on tumor weight, histology,
and other end points, although these agents were still more
effective in combination than individually (Supplementary Fig.
S1, Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, the strong efﬁcacy
of MK-2206 þ MK-8669 for inhibition of these castrationresistant tumors contrasted with the weak efﬁcacy of conventional chemotherapy (docetaxel; Fig. 3F, K, P, and U), paralleling the limited efﬁcacy of conventional chemotherapy for
CRPC in humans (6). Taken together, these preclinical studies
suggest that dual targeting Akt/mTOR signaling using MK2206 þ MK-8669 may be beneﬁcial for treatment of CRPC.
Dual targeted therapy of Akt/mTOR signaling affects Rb
signaling
We next sought to understand the mechanism of action of
MK-2206 þ MK-8669 in human prostate cancer cells in
culture, using PC3 and LNCaP cells (49; Fig. 4). First, we
conﬁrmed that these drugs inhibit their respective signaling
pathways by assessing phosphorylation at serine 473 on Akt
to evaluate inhibition by MK-2206, and phosphorylation of S6
and 4E-BP1, which are speciﬁc for mTORC1, as a read-out of
MK-8669 activity. As expected, the Akt (MK-2206) and mTOR
(MK-8669) inhibitors each restrain their respective pathways
in these human prostate cancer cells, as evident by Western
blot analyses (Fig. 4A). However, in both cell lines, treatment
with the mTOR inhibitor resulted in upregulation of Akt
phosphorylation speciﬁcally at serine 473 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, this was not observed in the mouse model (see Fig. 3),
reﬂecting a difference in the mouse model and human cancer
cell lines.
It has been reported that in human cancer cells, mTORC1
inhibition can result in phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 as a
consequence of mTORC2 complex activation in a Rictordependent manner (18). Indeed, we found that siRNA knockdown of Rictor effectively abrogated the MK-8669-dependent
upregulation of p-Akt at serine 473 (Fig. 4B). These observations suggest that the enhanced efﬁcacy of MK-2206 þ MK8669, at least in human cells, may be due in part from overcoming the consequences of feedback activation that occurs
when targeting the Akt/mTOR pathway with single agents.
Next, we examined the functional consequences of treatment with MK-2206 þ MK-8669 on the human prostate cancer
cell lines. Although these agents used individually or in
combination had no apparent effect on apoptosis or autophagy
(data not shown), they had a signiﬁcant effect on cellular
proliferation, as shown in PC3 cells (Fig. 4D) but also seen in

Finally, we considered the mechanisms by which MK-2206 þ

agent individually, resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in Rb
phosphorylation at 2 key serines [Ser(807/811) and Ser
(780); Fig. 4C], which are targets of cyclin E/CDK2 and cyclin
D/CDK4, respectively. Considering that a major target of the Rb
protein is the S-phase–inducing transcription factor E2F1 (51),
we evaluated the status of E2F target genes in the castrated
Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f prostate tumors (Fig. 5). Using GSEA

pathway analyses, we observed a signiﬁcant activation of
the E2F signaling pathway in the castration-resistant tumors
(Fig. 5A and B). Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR
validation of relevant target genes revealed that E2F target
genes that were upregulated in the Nkx3.1CE2/þ; Ptenf/f prostate
tumors, relative to the control prostate (i.e., Nkx3.1CE2/þ) were
accordingly downregulated following treatment with MK-2206
þ MK-8669 (e.g., XDH, PLAT, TAGLN2, and CD74; Fig. 5C).
Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that the observed
inhibition of CRPC by dual targeting the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway with MK-2206 þ MK-8669 is mediated by negative
regulation of cellular proliferation through the Rb signaling
pathway. Considering that the Rb pathway is one of the key
pathways affected in CRPC (12, 22), drugs that affect RB
pathway activity may be advantageous for a signiﬁcant number
of patients.

Discussion
In this study, we provide in vivo preclinical evidence from a
reﬁned GEM model of CRPC, complemented by analyses of

www.aacrjournals.org

human prostate cancer cells in culture, to show the efﬁcacy
of dual targeting of Akt/mTOR signaling for treatment of
CRPC. An important feature of our reﬁned GEM model is
that tumors arise following inducible Pten inactivation in the
adult prostate, which differs from previous GEM models on
the basis of conditional inactivation of Pten in immature
prostate epithelium, or its germline loss-of-function
(34, 36, 38). Nonetheless, in this new GEM model, as was
the case for the previous ones (34, 36), castration results in
an initial regression, followed by the emergence of castration-resistant tumors that are more aggressive than their
noncastrated counterparts. Importantly, our ﬁndings indicate that these castration-resistant tumors, which are otherwise quite similar to their noncastrated counterparts,
display a virtual absence of senescence, which is a hallmark
of Pten loss-driven prostate tumors (27). Thus, our ﬁndings
support the idea that cellular senescence restrains Pten lossdriven prostate tumors (27), and further suggests that castration unleashes a more aggressive form of the disease by
bypassing senescence.

Our preclinical ﬁndings in this GEM model and complementary studies using human prostate cancer cells, along with
a previous cell culture study (43), suggest that the combined
use of agents targeting distinct components of Akt/mTOR
signaling may be advantageous, in part because they overcome
a feedback loop that is believed to limit the efﬁcacy of single
agents. However, it is important to note that the observed
consequences of these agents may differ when evaluated in cell
culture versus in vivo and in human cells versus mouse models
(52). In particular, although a feedback mechanism was readily
evident in our analyses of human prostate cancer cell lines in
culture (see Fig. 4), we did not observe this in our analyses of
the GEM mice in vivo (see Fig. 3). Other studies have shown that
although rapamycin blocks S6 phosphorylation, but not AktS473
phosphorylation in various cell lines, prolonged exposure to
rapamycin can also target mTORC2 (53). Therefore, additional
factors in vivo may contribute to the enhanced efﬁcacy of the
dual inhibition Akt/mTOR signaling, in addition to limiting
feedback inhibition. Furthermore, our ﬁndings indicate that
dual inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling with MK-2206 þ MK8669 is linked to inhibition of cellular proliferation via the RB
signaling pathway, which is deregulated in a large subset of
patients with CRPC (12, 22).
On the basis of our ﬁndings showing the enhanced efﬁcacy of
dual inhibition of Akt/mTOR signaling, we propose that the
combination of MK-2206 þ MK-8669 should be evaluated in
clinical trials for patients with CRPC. Given the intractable
nature of this disease, which has resisted many treatment
modalities thus far, we further suggest that MK-2206 þ MK8669 should be considered as part of a broader treatment
regime that includes agents directed toward alternative
mechanisms relevant for the disease. In this regard, the androgen receptor agonist, MDV3100, has shown tremendous promise in the clinic (8), has improved efﬁcacy in combination with a
PI3K inhibitor in castration-resistant GEM mice (36). Therefore, it will be of interest to evaluate MK-2206 þ MK-8669
combined with agents that target androgen signaling, such as
MDV3100 as well as Abiraterone. In addition, our intriguing
ﬁnding showing the inverse correlation of castration resistance
and cellular senescence suggests the possibility of combining

MK-2206 þ MK-8669 with a prosenescence therapy, as proposed by Pandolﬁ and colleagues (54). Such combinations can
be readily evaluated in preclinical studies using these GEM
mice, which can provide an initial assessment of the efﬁcacy of
the various combinations, as well as mechanistic insights into
drug actions. In summary, we propose that dual targeting of
Akt/mTOR signaling using MK-2206 þ MK-8669 may contribute to a treatment regime for CRPC.
