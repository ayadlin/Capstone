ABSTRACT
Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been linked to cancer stemlike (CD44+) cell in the prostate cancer (PCa) metastasis. However, the molecular
mechanism remains elusive. Here, we found EMT contributed to metastasis in PCa
patients failed in androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). Castration TRAMP model also
proved PCa treated with ADT promoted EMT with increased CD44+ stem-like cells.
Switched CD44+ cell to EMT cell is a key step for luminal PCa cell metastasis. Our
results also suggested ADT might go through promoting TGFβ1-CD44 signaling to
enhance swift to EMT. Targeting CD44 with salinomycin and siRNA could inhibit cell
transition and decrease PCa invasion. Together, cancer stem-like (CD44+) cells could
be the initiator cells of EMT modulated by TGFβ1-CD44 signaling. Combined therapy
of ADT with anti-CD44 may become a new potential therapeutic approach to battle
later stage PCa.

INTRODUCTION

in a distant metastatic foci by re-differentiation (MET)
[9]. Although many experimental reports fostered the
concept of transient EMT-MET switches in metastasis,
there are few directly proofs or strong evidences [10,
11]. Two were published supporting that the role of an
EMT in dissemination and the need of a MET for efficient
metastasis [12, 13]. It is not clear whether cancer stem/
progenitor cell plays a role in EMT-MET switches.
However, we proved, in this paper, that the epithelial dedifferentiation towards caner stem/progenitor cells take
place before EMT transition as an essential condition.
CD44, a major adhesion molecule of the
extracellular matrix, being a marker of CSC has been
identified positive expression in many tumors, either
individually or in combination with other markers [1418]. Recent study found that the microRNA-34a inhibited
PCa caner stem/progenitor cells and metastasis by directly
repressing CD44 [19]. Cyclin-dependent kinase-like 2

Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has
been shown to be a pivotal mechanism contributing to
cancer invasion and metastasis [1], including prostate
cancer [2], due to epithelial cells lose their polarity and
acquire the migratory properties of mesenchymal cells
in the developmental process. In recent researches on
prostate cancer metastasis, EMT has been linked to stem
cell phenotype [3, 4]. As reportedly, EMT results in the
acquisition of stem cell-like properties including slow
proliferation and self-renewal potential [5-8]. However,
the molecular mechanism underlying EMT and regulation
of stemness remains elusive. Early studies revealed
EMT activators, such as Twist1, can co-induce EMT
and stemness properties [3, 7], thereby linking the EMT
and cancer stem cell concept [4]. However, metastasis
is the process of invasive de-differentiated cancer cells
leaving their primary tumor sites by EMT and colonized

gland epithelial cells displayed enhanced mesenchymal
traits and stem cell like phenotypes, which was acquired
through activating a ZEB1/E-cadherin/β-catenin positive
feedback loop and regulating CD44 mRNA alternative
splicing to promote conversion of CD24high cells to
CD44high cells[20]. Another published paper also showed
that CD44s regulated the TGFβ-mesenchymal phenotype
and was associated with poor prognosis in patients with
hepatocellular carcinoma [21]. Therefore, we hypothesize
that CD44 may play an important role in inducing EMT or
in maintaining the mesenchymal phenotype in PCa.
It is well established that TGFβ1 plays important
roles both in cancer EMT and cancer stem cell (CSC)
properties [22], and is up-regulated in PCa after androgen
deprivation therapy (ADT) [23, 24]. ADT is the standard
therapy for advanced PCa since androgen ablation
induces programmed cell death in malignant prostatic
epithelial cells [25, 26]. Although TGF-β1 signaling
is a major regulator of EMT and it helps to maintain
the mesenchymal phenotype and stem cell states in an
autocrine fashion in cancer [27]. However, a molecular
linkage of this pathway that integrates the mesenchymal
phenotype with the EMT process and CSC properties still
remains unknown. Here, we assess the role of CD44 as a
marker of cancer caner stem/progenitor cells in promoting
EMT and matastasis in PCa carcinogenesis, and reveal a
new potential therapeutic approach to battle PCa.

We then applied 2nd mouse model with
orthotopically xenografted LNCaP cells that either
sensitive to ADT or resistant to ADT treatment. We
found that ADT resistant LNCaP xenografted PCa have
lower E-Cadherin and higher N-cadherin and vimentin
as compare to those ADT sensitive LNCaP xenografted
PCa (Fig. 1c). Together, results from Fig 1a-c using
either human clinical data or 2 different mouse models all
demonstrated that ADT to target androgen/AR signaling
led to promote EMT in PCa.

Targeting androgen/AR signaling results in
promoted EMT with alternation of cancer stemlike cell population
In our TRAMP mouse model, mice were castrated
at 12-weeks-old and tumor samples were collected at
16wks, 20 wks, 24wks, 28wks (Fig. 2a). We found that the
proliferation marker, BrdU (and therefore, the growth rate
too) was gradually increased from 16 wks tumors treated
with ADT-castration to 32 wks tumor treated with ADTcastration castration tumor (Fig. 2b). In contrast, we found
enhanced metastasis with more and more metastatic foci in
liver, lung and kidney emerged from 24 wks tumor treated
with ADT with castration (Fig. 2c).
To dissect the mechanism(s) why ADT will
promote PCa metastasis in TRAMP mouse model, we
found that epithelial marker E-Cadherin decreased with
PCa progression after ADT-castration. Interestingly, we
also found stem-like cell markers, such as CD44+ and
CK5+/CK8+, increased with PCa progression after ADTcastration (Fig. 2d). We also noticed the luminal epithelial
cell tumor gradually reduced yet CD44+ and CK5+/CK8+
stem-like tumor gradually increased from the 16wks
(Fig. 2d), suggesting that while 16-20 wks tumor volume
became smaller with decreased epithelial markers than
those of 12 wks before ADT-castration, they did have
increased stem-like cell markers with more metastatic
foci formation (Supplemental Fig. 1). IHC staining also
confirmed those cells in the metastatic foci were mainly
composed of the cells with high cancer stem-like cell
markers (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Together, results from Fig. 2a-d and supplemental
Fig. 1 concluded that ADT with castration might promote
PCa metastasis by inducing PCa cell EMT and alter the
stem-like cell population.

RESULTS
PCa patients treated with ADT develop more
EMT
We first compared PCa patients treated with ADT
that already developed castration resistance (CRPC) vs
those still sensitive to ADT treatment (ADPC) their EMT
markers and found ADT-induced CRPC have altered
EMT signaling with decreased E-Cadherin and increased
N-cadherin and Vimentin (Fig.1a).

TRAMP mouse PCa treated with ADT develop
more EMT
We also applied TRAMP mouse model that can
spontaneously developed PCa to metastasis to demonstrate
the influence of ADT to PCa progression and altered EMT.
We found PCa from TRAMP mice treated with ADTcastration expressed less E-Cadherin than those from WTTRAMP mice in 20 wks and 24 wks (Fig. 1b). In contrast,
higher expressed N-cadherin was found in the PCa from
20wks and 24wks TRAMP mice with ADT with castration
than those from Wt-TRAMP mice (Fig. 1b).

The protocol of TRAMP mice experiments was illustrated. TRAMP mice were castrated at 12-week-old. Tumor samples were collected and
analyzed at 12wks, 16wks, 20wks, 24wks and 32wks. (b)The growth rates of prostate epithelium were demonstrated by BrdU incorporation
in TRAMP prostate before and after castration. The mice were i.p. injected with BrdU (10 ug/g body weight) every 6hr, and killed 24hr
later. Paraffin-fixed tissue sections were stained by the BrdU detecting kit (Zymed Laboratories). The castration decreased the BrdU
incorporation rates in 16wks-old mouse prostates, while the BrdU incorporation rates began to increase from 20wks and even higher than
pre-castration from about 24wks (P<0.05), indicating the happen of CRPC. (c) Considerable metastatic foci in lung kidney and liver of were
gradually increased from 24-wk-castration TRAMP mice. (d) From 20wks to 24wks, the castration resistant tumor continually grew bigger
in gross (the first and second upper row). H&E staining showed that castration resistant tumors are poorly differentiated from 16wks to
24wks tumor samples (the third row). When double staining CK5 (green, marker for basal epithelial cell) and CK8 (red, marker for luminal
epithelial cell) in immunofluorescence examination, the decreasing CK8+ staining following castration were detected, and the increasing
CK5+/CK8+ (yellow color, overlapped by green and red signals) cells, which indicated the expansion of intermediate cell population,
were noticed in 16wks and 20wks tumors (the fourth row). Interestingly, the staining for epithelial markers, both CK5 and CK8, was
significantly diminished in 24wks tumors. The CD44 expression significantly increased in 20wks and 24wks of castration resistant tumors
(the fifth row). And the expression of E-Cadherin significantly decreased in 20wks and 24wks of castration resistant tumors (the last row).
Significance was defined as p<0.05(*). (e) To summarize the sequential events following castration. After the TRAMP mice were castrated
in 12wks, the dedifferentiation of epithelium, characterized by expanded CK5+/CK8+ cell population, happened in 16wks, followed by the
EMT transition on 20wks and metastasis on 24wks.

those in human naïve specimens (Fig.5a, lane 1 and lane
3). And more importantly, CK5+/CK8+ (Fig.5a, lane 4)
and CD44+/CK8+ (Fig.5a, lane 5) cells also increased
in CRPC compared with those in hormone naïve. We
further confirmed that CD44+ LNCaP cells expressed
higher N-cadherin and Vimentin, with lower E-cadherin
compared to those in CD44- LNCaP cells (Fig.5b).
Furthermore, we also identified high CD44 expression
in liver and diaphragm metastatic tumors comparing to
the primary tumor of CWR22rv1 orthotopic xenografts
(Fig.5c). Together, data from Fig.5 suggested that EMT
like cell might be originated from PCa luminal cell (CK8+),
which de-differentiated to CD44+/CK8+ cell, then acquired
properties of mesenchymal, such as high expression of
N-cadherin and Vimentin, combined with low expression
of E-cadherin. This kind of CD44+ cancer stem like cell
could be as an initiator of EMT like cell with the function
of metastasis. Therefore, targeting CD44+ cancer stem like
cell may decrease PCa EMT and metastasis.

Due to CD44+ cell population increased was one
of essential conditions for EMT in CRPC, we further
detected whether expression of CD44 was correlated with
prognosis in clinic. The expression of CD44 was analyzed
in 118 PCa patient samples. A cut-off value of 10% was
determined from the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, and according to this value, two groups
(low and high CD44 staining) were assigned. The high
level expression of CD44 was significantly related to the
disease risk but not in age subgroup (Fig.7a-c). KaplanMeier curve was addressed to evaluate the role of CD44
as a prognosis marker, showing that high expression level
of CD44 was associated with biochemical recurrence
and distant metastasis (Fig.7d&7e). The above clinical
data suggested that CD44 may become a poor prognosis
marker of PCa.
We summarized the data and concluded that
activation of TGFβ signaling induced by ADT led to dedifferentiation phenotype as a result of increased CD44+
cancer stem like cell population, which subsequently
generated to EMT like cell through TGFβ/CD44 signaling
(Fig. 7f). Retarding PCa luminal cell de-differentiated
to CD44+/CK8+ cell is a key step to control EMT and
metastasis in PCa.

Targeting CD44 led to decrease PCa EMT and
metastasis in vivo
All above results suggest ADT to TGFβ1 to CD44
to EMT to PCa metastasis may represent a key signaling
to influence the PCa metastasis. We are interested to see
if target this newly identified signaling may yield any
major impact on PCa metastasis. We then target CD44
with salinomycin to examine its therapeutic effect on the
PCa progression. We first treated LNCaP and CWR22rv1
cell with salinomycin and found that salinomycin could
decrease CD44 expression (Fig. 6a). We then applied
CWR22rv1 xenograft mouse model via subcutaneously
implanted 1x107 CWR22rv1 cell on the dorsal prostate
of nude mice. After tumor diameter reached to 0.8cm, it
was divided into equal pieces and transplanted into the
both prostate anterior lobe of castrated nude mice. One
group of the mice were treated with salinomycin by
intra-peritoneal injection, the others was intra-peritoneal
injection with corn oil as control. The results showed the
mice treated with salinomycin developed less malignant
metastatic tumor as compared to those found from control
group (Fig. 6b). Importantly, we also found decreased
CD44 expression, with altered EMT markers for the
decreased vimentin and increased E-Cadherin in the
tumor with salinomycin treatment compared to those
from control group (Fig. 6c). Furthermore, the expression
of cancer stem cell markers like c-Met, Sox2, Oct-4 were
also decreased in the tumor with salinomycin treatment
compared to those from control group (Fig.6c).
Together, results from Fig. 6a-c concluded that
targeting CD44+ cancer stem like cell led to decrease PCa
EMT and metastasis in vivo.

DISCUSSION
Epithelial-mesenchymal
transition
(EMT),
associated with prostate cancer progression, has given
a reason to explain the altered expression of various
lineage markers in pathological specimens. Although,
cancer caner stem/progenitor cells has been suggested
linked to EMT recently [7], the molecular mechanism
involving the transition from caner stem/progenitor cells
to mesenchymal phenotype cells remains elusive. Here,
we demonstrate that CD44+ stem-like cell as an initiator
of EMT cells contributes in cell transition and PCa
metastasis, which is regulated by TGFβ1-CD44 signaling.
ADT challenge the hormone naïve as a stress,
which forces the androgen dependent PCa cells death,
while other cells, in response to survive pressure, become
depending on other signaling instead of androgen
signaling. In the prostate epithelial, there is a subtype of
cells, so called basal or caner stem/progenitor cells, which
are androgen insensitive. The dedifferentiation from
luminal epithelial cells to basal or caner stem/progenitor
cells has been reported previously [28]. Goldstein et al
[29] has reported that the caner stem/progenitor cells exist
in the luminal epithelial cells in the experimental condition
of castration. In Fig.2, we show the phenomenon of the
increase of CK5+/CK8+ double positive intermediate cells
in 16wks castrated mice is the earlier event than EMT
promotion till 20wks, indicating that the dedifferentiation

changes in down-regulated epithelial markers and upregulated mesenchymal markers resulted in the loss of
prostatic glandular architecture and consistent with poor
differentiated phenotype of aggressive PCa. Of note, in
Fig.5, we found CD44+ cancer caner stem/progenitor cells

results in EMT process rather than CD44- cells.
It is documented well that ADT increase the
expression of TGF-β1 in PCa [24, 30], which induces
EMT via many pathways including Smad or nonSmad-mediated pathways [31]. Interestingly, loss of the
epithelium-specific transcription factor prostate-derived

ETS factor (PDEF), which is down-regulated by TGF-β,
induces EMT in PC3 cells, emphasizing the relationship
between tumor de-differentiation and EMT [32].
Contrarily, prostate-derived ETS factor (PDEF) has been
proposed as a tumor suppressor, could inhibit invasion
and metastasis through reverse EMT [33]. Another study
showed that maspin was sufficient to drive prostate tumor
cells through a spectrum of temporally and spatially
polarized cellular processes of re-differentiation, a reversal
of EMT [34]. In this study, we show CD44, in response to
TGFβ1, regulates the mesenchymal phenotype in prostate
cancer cells. Our finding is consistent with another report
that CD44+ prostate cancer cells are highly tumorigenic
and metastatic [35].
Here, we target CD44+ cancer caner stem/
progenitor cells with salinomycin resulting in suppress of
EMT and metastasis, which has recently been documented
to effectively eliminate caner stem/progenitor cells in
different types of human cancers in vitro and in xenograft
mice bearing human cancers [36-39]. Importantly,
salinomycin is not only able to kill caner stem/progenitor
cells, but also regular tumor cells and highly indolent
tumor cells displaying resistance to cytotoxic drugs,
radiation, and induction of apoptosis [40,41], may prevent
prostate cancer metastasis. Due to ADT inducing EMT via
stem-like differentiation, a potential therapy of targeting
stem-like (CD44+) cells may suppress EMT, consequently,
recurrence and metastasis in PCa. Therefore, targeting
CD44+ cells, combined with ADT may become a new
therapeutic approach to battle later stage PCa.

the ﬂank of 8-wk-old BALB/C nude mice with androgen
recruitment (Jackson Laboratories). Tumor incidence and
growth was monitored during different time periods post
injection. Tumors grew up to 1.0 cm in diameter, at which
point animals were euthanized. After the diameter of
LNCaP xenograft tumors reached to 0.8-1.0 cm, the tumor
samples were collected and named androgen dependent
xenograft tumor. We removed androgen supplementary
from the nude mice with diameter-0.8cm LNCaP xenograft
tumors and castrated them for one week, then sacrificed
the mice and collected tumors named ADT tumor. When
the diameter of LNCaP xenograft tumor re-grew to 0.8cm
in the castrated mice, we sacrificed the mice and collected
the tumors named castration resistant LNCaP xenograft
tumor. Each tumor was dissected, ﬁxed in formalin, and

CWR22rv1 (CRL-2505) and LNCaP cells were
maintained in RPMI medium (Gibco) with 10% FBS
(Gibco) at 37oC in 5% CO2. They were also supplemented
with 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin. Purified recombinant
human TGFβ1 (R&D Systems) was reconstituted in sterile
4 mmol/L HCl containing 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(Sigma). TGFβ1 was used at the indicated concentrations
in serum-free medium. SB431542 were purchased from
R&D Systems.

processed for histopathology examination.

Orthotopic xenograft

We digested the cells by trypsin-EDTA, harvested
as many as 1×106 cells, and fixed them in 70% ethanol
at 4°C. After 12h, cells were centrifuged (1,000×g, 5min,
4°C), resuspended in PBS containing 0.05 mg/ml Rnase
A (Sigma), and then incubated with CD44-PE (Sanjian,
Tianjin, China) at room temperature for 30 min. After
washing and staining with 10 mg/ml propidium iodide,
cells were filtered through a 60-mm mesh, and 10,000
cells were analyzed by flow cytometry (FACS Calibur, BD
Company) with ModFit software (Verity Software House,
Inc.).

Single cell suspensions of CWR22rv1 cell lines
(5×106 cells) in Matrigel (BD Biosciences) (1/1) were
injected subcutaneously in the dorsal of 8-wk-old
BALB/C nude mice with androgen recruitment (Jackson
Laboratories). After tumor diameter reached to 0.8cm, the
tumors were divided into equal patches and orthotopically
implanted them into the both prostate anterior lobe of
8-wk-old BALB/C nude mice, which were castrated
one week before. They were divided into two groups.
Each group has 5 mice. One group were treated with
salinomycin by intraperitoneal injection, the other group
were intraperitoneally treated with corn oil as control.
Mice were killed 14 wks later, and orthotopic xenograft
and metastatic tumors were fixed and embedded in paraffin
for further analyses.

Migration and Invasion Assays
To analysis invasion, CWR22rv1 and LNCaP cells
were treated with TGFβ1; after 48hrs, 2.5 × 104 cells
were seeded into 24-well cell culture inserts with 8 µm
pores (BD Falcon). As a chemoattractant, 10% FBS was
used in the lower chamber. Cultures were maintained for
48 h, then non-motile cells at the top of the ﬁlter were
removed and the cells in the lower chamber were ﬁxed
with methanol and stained with Diff-Quick staining kit
(Dade Behring). Either the number of cells per well or ﬁve
different ﬁelds per condition was counted by microscopy.
Relative invasion was calculated in relation to the control.

RNA extraction and Real-time RT-PCR
RNA was isolated using the RNAprep Pure Cell/
Bacteria Kit (TianGen, Beijing, China) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and digested with DNase
I to prevent amplification of genomic DNA. Reversed
transcription was performed using Quant Script RT Kit
(TianGen, Beijing, China). The 20μl cDNA was then
diluted by water into 200μl. 2μl reverse transcribed
cDNA were used for PCR and real-time quantitative
PCR the MyCycler thermal cycler (Bio-RAD) with by
Taq polymerase and on the iCycler IQ multicolor realtime PCR detection system with 1/5μl cDNA amplified
by SYBR Green PCR Master Mix, respectively. The PCR
amplification conditions were as follows: pre-denaturing
at 95C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of amplifications
by denaturing at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at 60°C for 1
min, extension at 72°C for 1 min. After a final extension
at 72°C for 10 min, the amplified products were subjected
to a stepwise increase in temperature from 55 to 95°C to
construct dissociation curves. Each sample was run and
analyzed in triplicate.

Mammosphere and Tumor sphere Assay
Assays were performed as previously described with
modiﬁcation [43]. 1000 cells/well were seeded in 6-well
ultra-low adhesion plates (Costar) in MEGM medium
containing 10% Serum Replacement (KnockOut™)
supplemented with 1× MEM non-essential amino acid
(Gibco), 20 ng/ml EGF (R&D Systems), 10 ng/ml bFGF
(R&D Systems), and B27 (GIBCO). For secondary
sphere formation, primary spheres were dissociated by
trypsinization and replated at 1000 cells/well.

Clinical PCa Patients Study

BrdU Incorporation Assay

A total of 118 cases of primary PCa diagnosed
between 2003 and 2009 were retrieved from the medical
files of the 2nd Hospital of Tianjin Medical University,
China. The median follow-up was 45 months ranged
from 9 to 120 months. The study was conducted under a
protocol approved by Institutional Review Board of the
2nd Hospital of Tianjin Medical University. Of the 118
patients, 46 had biochemical recurrence before 72 months
(median time to recurrence 21 months, ranged from 3 to
72) and 72 were free of disease recurrence (mean followup 48 months, ranged from 21 to 120). Biochemical
recurrence was deﬁned as a PSA level > 0.2 ng/ml in 2

We purchased 5’-Bromo-2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU)
from Sigma and dissolved it in double distilled water at
10 mg/ml. Starting at 24hr before sacrifice, we injected
mice i.p. every 6h with 10 μg BrdU per gram body weight.
Following harvest, we embedded tissues in paraffin and
labeled them following the BrdU Staining Kit (Zymed)
manufacturer’s instructions.

successive measurements (ie, two consecutive doublefold increases) after radical prostatectomy [44]. Patient
characteristics including age, preoperative PSA (iPSA)
and tumor pathology (i.e., Gleason sum, stage, margin and
seminal vesicle invasion) are collected, and then disease
risk was classified according to guideline from European
Association of Urology (EAU)[44] based on above
characteristics. In brief, the risk patterns were classified
into three groups: 1) low-risk PCa (iPSA < 10 ng / ml
and Gleason score≤6 and cT1c–cT2a); 2) intermediaterisk PCa (PSA 10.1-20 ng / ml or Gleason score=3+4 or
cT2b-c); 3) high-risk PCa (PSA > 20 ng / ml or Gleason
score≥4+3 or ≥cT3a).

After IHC staining, the entire section was evaluated
by two respective observers being unaware of the clinical
data. Slides for CD44 were scored like described by Ekici
et al [46]. The tumor cells were determined positive when
a clearly visible staining signal was detected on the cell
membrane. Normal prostate tissue and/or benign prostatic
hyperplasia glands were included to be as internal controls.
Positive cell was graded as 1%, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%,
25% and 30%. CD44 positive basal cells in benign paracarcinoma tissue were not included during the scoring
process. A cut-off value was determined from the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and according to
this value, 2 groups (low and high CD44 staining) were
assigned.
