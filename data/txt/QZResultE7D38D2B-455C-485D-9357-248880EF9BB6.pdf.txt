and Monocytic Differentiation of HL-60 Cells

Abstract
Here, we show that the platelet-derived growth factor receptor
(PDGFR) regulates myeloid and monocytic differentiation of
HL-60 myeloblastic leukemia cells in response to retinoic acid
(RA) and vitamin D3 (D3), respectively. Both RA and D3
decreased the expression of PDGFR-A and PDGFR-B throughout differentiation. When cells were treated with the PDGFR
inhibitor AG1296 in addition to RA or D3, signs of terminal
differentiation such as inducible oxidative metabolism and
cell substrate adhesion were enhanced. These changes were
accompanied by an increased extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1/2 activation. AG1296 also resulted in elevated
expression of differentiation markers CD11b and CD66c when
administered with RA or D3. Interestingly, other markers did not follow the same pattern. Cells receiving AG1296
in addition to RA or D3 showed decreased G1-G0 arrest and
CD14, CD38, and CD89 expression. We thus provide evidence
that certain sets of differentiation markers can be enhanced,
whereas others can be inhibited by the PDGFR pathway. In
addition, we found calcium levels to be decreased by RA and
D3 but increased when AG1296 was given in addition to RA
or D3, suggesting that calcium levels decrease during myeloid
or monocytic differentiation, and elevated calcium levels can
disturb the expression of certain differentiation markers.

Introduction
The platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) has been
implicated in a variety of cancers and leukemias. The constitutively
active PDGFR-a fusion protein, FIPL1-PDGFR-a, has been identified in idiopathic hypereosinophilia (1). PDGFR-h is constitutively activated when fused with the transcription factor Tel (2)
or rabaptin-5 (3) as seen in some cases of chronic myelogenous
leukemias (CML). Up-regulation of PDGFs or PDGFR has been
found in cancers (4). The importance of PDGF signaling in cancer
was illustrated by the successful treatment of CML (5) and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (6) by imatinib mesylate (Gleevec),
an inhibitor of the PDGFR family, Abl, and Arg tyrosine kinases (7).
PDGFs are mitogenic during early development, driving
proliferation of the undifferentiated mesenchyme (8). PDGFs have
been described to mediate the proliferation of oligodendrocyte
progenitor cells (9) and inhibit the differentiation of 3T3 preadipocytes (10) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (11).
The role of the PDGFR in hematopoietic differentiation is not clear,

but has been reported to enhance the expansion of early, myeloid,
and erythroid progenitors (12). Hence, the fact that immature
hematopoietic cells are highly proliferative whereas mature cells
are typically growth arrested (13) could be, at least in part, mediated by the PDGFR. It is therefore plausible that PDGF negatively
impacts differentiation in hematopoietic cells by favoring an
undifferentiated, proliferative state. Indeed, leukemias have been
suggested to result from a disruption of differentiation of hematopoietic cells (14).
HL-60 cells are human myeloblastic leukemia cells that serve as
a model for studying differentiation induction therapy (15). These
cells undergo growth arrest and myeloid differentiation in response
to retinoic acid (RA) or monocytic differentiation in response to
1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (D3; ref. 16).
In the current study, we aimed to determine the role of the
PDGFR in the myeloid and monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells.
To manipulate PDGFR signaling, we employed AG1296, a potent
inhibitor for PDGFR and its family members, Kit and Flt3 (17),
to antagonize serum or PDGF-BB to promote PDGFR signaling.
We find that inhibiting the PDGFR enhances various facets of
both RA-induced myeloid differentiation and D3-induced monocytic differentiation, including inducible oxidative metabolism, a
functional differentiation marker characterizing mature myeloid
or monocytic cells. However, other features typical of these
induced differentiation programs were diminished, including
induced G0 cell cycle arrest. PDGFR dependence has thus provided a means of grouping differentiation markers associated with
functional differentiation and distinct markers associated with G0
arrest.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells were grown in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (both
Invitrogen) and 1 antibiotic/antimycotic (Sigma) in a 5% CO2 humidified
atmosphere at 37jC. RA and D3 (Sigma) were added from a stock solution
in ethanol with a final concentration of 2 and 0.5 Amol/L, respectively.
AG1296 (Calbiochem) was added to cell cultures 1 h before RA and D3
treatment at a concentration of 10 or 20 Amol/L from a stock solution
(20 mmol/L) in DMSO. Equal amounts of DMSO were added to all
treatment groups not receiving AG1296. For experiments using 100 ng/mL
PDGF-BB (Antigenix), cells were cultured in 1% serum 24 h before
and during treatment. Experimental cultures were initiated at a density of
0.2  106 cells/mL. Selected experiments were confirmed in NB4 cells,
which were cultured and treated as described above.
CD11b, CD14, CD38, CD66c, CD89, and PDGFR expression studies.
About 0.5  106 cells were collected from cultures and centrifuged at
1,000 rpm in a microfuge for 5 min. Cell pellets were resuspended in 100 AL
37jC PBS containing 5 AL of the respective antibody (allophycocyaninconjugated CD11b, FITC-conjugated CD14, phycoerythrin-conjugated CD38,
PDGFR-a, and PDGFR-h; all from BD Biosciences). Following 1 h incubation
at 37jC, cell surface expression levels were analyzed with a BD LSRII flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). To stain for CD66ce, we used a mouse primary
antibody with dual specificity to CD66c and CD66e (Genetex) for 1 h,

washed with PBS, stained with an Alexa 350–conjugated goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Invitrogen), and analyzed by flow cytometry.
Undifferentiated control cells were used to determine the fluorescence
intensity of cells negative for the respective surface antigen. The gate to
determine percent increase of expression was set at the highest 5% of the
control population. Results given as mean fluorescence intensity were
determined by quantifying the fluorescence intensity of the entire cell
population sample (30,000 cells) by flow cytometry.
Measurement of inducible oxidative metabolism. About 0.5  106
cells were collected and pelleted, resuspended in 200 AL 37jC PBS
containing 5 Amol/L 5- (and 6)-chloromethyl-2¶,7¶-dichlorodihydro-fluorescein diacetate acetyl ester (H2-DCF, Molecular Probes) and 0.2 Ag/mL 12O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA, Sigma). Both H2-DCF and TPA
stock solutions were made with DMSO at concentrations of 0.2 mg/mL and
5 mmol/L, respectively. Cells were incubated for 20 min at 37jC before
analysis by flow cytometry. Oxidized DCF was excited by a 488-nm laser,
and emission was collected through a 505 long-pass dichroic mirror and a
530/30-nm bandpass filter. The shift in fluorescence intensity in response to
TPA was used to determine the percent cells, with the capability to generate
inducible oxidative metabolites. Gates to determine percent positive cells
were set at the highest 5% of control cells not stimulated with TPA.
Calcium measurement. Cell cultures (1 mL) were sampled and
incubated in 1 Amol/L fluo-3 acetoxymethyl ester (Molecular Probes). After
1 h in 37jC, cells were washed with 37jC PBS. Cells were resuspended
in 200 AL 37jC PBS and incubated for another 30 min to allow complete
de-esterification of intracellular fluo-3 acetoxymethyl esters. Calcium-bound
fluo-3 has an emission maximum of 526 nm that was quantified after
excitation with a 488-nm laser and collection through a 530/30-nm bandpass filter by flow cytometry. Mean fluorescence intensity was determined
from the entire cell population.
Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation assay.
About 0.5  106 cells were collected from cultures and pelleted, fixed by 2%
paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized using 90% ice-cold methanol.
Samples were washed in PBS, stained with allophycocyanin-conjugated
antibody specific for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p42/44
dually phosphorylated at Thr202 and Tyr204 (Cell Signaling). Flow-cytometric
analysis was done following a 1-h incubation period. Fluorescence intensity
of control cells was assumed to represent basal levels of pERK. Logic gates
defining the percentage of cells exceeding basal pERK levels were set at the
highest 5% of untreated control cells.
Cell adhesion. To obtain a relative count of adhesive cells, we treated
5-mL cell cultures with RA or D3 in the absence or presence of AG1296 in
25-cm2 tissue culture flasks. Cells in suspension were removed after 72 h.
The remaining adhesive cells were counted using a Zeiss IM35 inverted
microscope using 400 magnification. Four different random fields were
counted throughout the flask. Counts obtained therefore represent a
relative number of adhering cells out of the same volume and density
of cells.
Cell cycle analysis. About 0.5  106 cells were collected from cultures.
The cytosol was removed by resuspending the cell pellet in hypotonic
staining solution containing 50 Ag/mL propidium iodide (PI), 1 AL/mL
Triton-X100, and 1 mg/mL sodium citrate. Cells were incubated for 1 h at
room temperature and analyzed by flow cytometry. Doublets were
identified by a PI signal width versus area plot and excluded from analysis.
Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis of PDGFR ubiquitination. PDGFR ubiquitination was determined by fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET). Cells were paraformaldehyde and
methanol fixed as described above. We used mouse anti-human PDGFR-a
or PDGFR-h (BD Biosciences) and rabbit anti-ubiquitin (Abcam) antibodies
as primary antibodies. Secondary goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit
antibodies were tagged with Alexa 350 and Alexa 430, respectively (both
Invitrogen). Specific staining of the PDGFR and ubiquitin was determined
by detecting Alexa 350 by 325-nm excitation and collection through a
440/40 bandpass filter and Alexa 430 by 488-nm excitation and collection
through a 530/30 bandpass. PDGFR ubiquitination was determined by
measuring the energy transfer from Alexa 350 to Alexa 430 reflected by the
emission from Alexa 430 collected through a 530/30 bandpass filter after

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

325 nm excitation. When the fluorescent tags are in a proximity close
enough, the donor (Alexa 350) can excite the acceptor (Alexa 430) by
emitting light in the range of 430 to 450 nm, causing the acceptor to emit at
530 nm. Background was set using the primary and secondary antibody for
PDGFR only and the secondary antibody for ubiquitin.
PDGFR phosphorylation assay. HL-60 cells were cultured for 24 h in 1%
serum with and without 10 Amol/L AG1296. Samples (1 mL) were taken
from the cell culture and stimulated or not with 100 ng/mL PDGF-AB
(Antigenix) for 10 min. Cells were paraformaldehyde and methanol
fixed. We used a 1:100 dilution for the primary antibodies against pY1021
PDGFR-h (GeneTex) and pY754 PDGFR-a (Cell Signaling), respectively,
and a 1:200 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody
(BD Biosciences). The FITC signal was analyzed by 488 nm excitation
and collecting emission through a 505 long-pass dichroic mirror and a
530/30-nm bandpass filter. Cells stained with secondary antibody alone
was used to determine background staining, and a gate to quantify cells
staining for pPDGFR was set to exclude at least 95% of the background
signal.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analyses were done using SPSS 11.0 for
Windows, Student Edition. Means of treatment groups of interest were
compared using the paired-samples t test. All treatment groups were

compared with control cells. The effect of AG1296 was determined by
comparing groups receiving RA or D3 with groups receiving RA or D3 plus
AG1296. A P value of <0.05 was considered significant.

Results
Inhibition of the PDGFR increases the expression of CD11b
and CD66c. To investigate the effect of the PDGFR on
differentiation markers CD11b and CD66c cells were treated with
the inhibitor of the PDGFR, AG1296, 1 h before RA or D3
administration. AG1296 increased the D3-induced CD11b expression from 48.1% to 78.2% (P = 0.016). AG1296 also increased the
RA-induced CD11b expression from 24.3% to 35.1% (Fig. 1A). After
72 h, AG1296 treatment increased the RA- or D3-mediated
expression of CD66ce in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). RAtreated cells with the 20 Amol/L AG1296 had a significant higher
expression of CD66ce compared with cells receiving RA alone
(P = 0.025) or RA plus 10 Amol/L AG1296 (P = 0.036). D3 plus
20 Amol/L AG1296-treated cells had significantly higher CD66ce
expression levels when compared with cells receiving D3 alone
(P = 0.023) or D3 with 10 Amol/LAG1296 (P = 0.031). Consistent
with the effect of the PDGFR inhibitor AG1296, low (1%) serum
accelerated the expression of CD11b (Fig. 1C) compared with
treatment groups cultured in 5% or 10% serum. PDGFR, if activated
by serum, retards CD11b expression, whereas inhibiting PDGFR
enhances CD11b expression. Cells receiving RA in 10% serum had

www.aacrjournals.org

significantly lower CD11b expression compared with RA-treated
cells in 1% serum (P = 0.048).
Inhibition of the PDGFR increases the percentage of
functionally differentiated cells. Here, we tested whether
inhibiting the PDGFR with AG1296 would also increase the
percentage of cells capable of inducible oxidative metabolism in
response to RA or D3. Pretreating for 1 h with AG1296 before
RA administration increased the percentage of responsive cells
from 10.2% to 33.9% (P = 0.032, Fig. 2A). Likewise, when
cells were treated with AG1296 before D3 treatment, 46.3%
of cells were capable of producing ROS compared with 27.4%
of cells that were treated with D3 alone. In contrast, high serum
for 48 h (Fig. 2B) resulted in a decrease in the percentage of
cells capable of inducible oxidative metabolism. RA-treated cells
in 10% serum had significantly fewer cells capable of producing reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared with RA-treated
cells in 5% serum (P = 0.043). Cells treated with D3 in 5% serum
showed a significant induction of cells capable of producing
ROS (P = 0.032), whereas cells treated with D3 in 10% serum
did not. To test whether the PDGFR was specifically involved in
the modified response to RA or D3, we used 100 ng/mL PDGFBB to activate the PDGFR. At 24 h posttreatment, 29.9% of
RA-treated cells were capable of inducible oxidative metabolism,
whereas only 8.9% of cells treated with RA and PDGF-BB were
capable of inducible oxidative metabolism (Fig. 2C). Similarly,
when cells were treated with D3 and PDGF-BB for 24 h, 11.0%

(P = 0.018 compared with D3) of cells were capable of inducible
oxidative metabolism compared with 18.1% of cells treated with D3
alone (Fig. 2C).
AG1296 increases substrate adhesion of myeloid or monocytic HL-60 cells. Substrate adhesion is another attribute of
myeloid/monocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells. Counting
four random fields of a Zeiss IM35 microscope using 400
magnification, on average, 22 cells adhered to the cell culture
flask when treated with RA only compared with 45 (P = 0.034) when
cells were treated with AG1296 and RA (Fig. 2D). Similarly,
the number of adherent cells increased from 122 when cells
received D3 to 237 (P = 0.030) when cells received AG1296 in
addition to D3. Although adhesiveness is a marker of enhanced
differentiation, it also contributes to retinoic acid syndrome, a
common complication during RA treatment of patients with
acute promyelocytic leukemia, which is characterized by leukemic
cells adhering to endothelial cells in cardiac and pulmonary tissues (18).
Inhibition of the PDGR decreases CD38, CD14, and CD89
expression. We also investigated the effect of AG1296 on CD14,
CD38, and CD89 expression. After 24 h, RA induced CD38
expression in 90.7% cells, whereas pretreatment with AG1296
for 1 h decreased the RA-responsive CD38 expression to 70.7%
(P = 0.035, Fig. 3A). Likewise, CD38 expression in response to D3
was reduced from 55.2% to 39.4% (P = 0.040) when the PDGFR

was inhibited with AG1296. CD14 expression was also reduced,
decreasing from 29.3% for RA-treated cells to 17.3% (P = 0.030 for
RA- and AG1296-treated cells). About 70.3% of D3-treated cells
expressed CD14 compared with 66.7% of D3- and AG1296-treated
cells. Similarly, RA-induced CD89 expression was reduced from
31.6% to 16.1% (P = 0.005), when AG1296 was used in addition to
RA. AG1296 also had less effect on D3-mediated CD89 expression.
About 54.3% of D3-treated cells expressed CD14 compared with
53.0% of D3- and AG1296-treated cells.
CD38 was not significantly increased by increasing serum
(Fig. 3B). However, D3-treated cells in 5% serum had significantly
(P = 0.020) higher CD38 expression compared with cells treated
in 1% serum, and D3-treated cells in 10% cells had significantly
higher CD38 expression compared with both D3-treated cells in 1%
serum (P = 0.016) and 5% serum (P = 0.044).
Similarly, PDGF-BB could increase CD38 expression induced by
RA from 17.1% to 22.3% (P = 0.013) and induced by D3 from 7.8% to
13.8% (Fig. 3C).
The fact that these markers did not follow the pattern of other
differentiation markers indicates a differential effect of the PDGFR
on various differentiation markers.
AG1296 has similar effects on differentiation markers in
NB4 cells. To determine if the effect of AG1296 on differentiation
was unique to HL-60 cells, we also tested the expression levels of
selected markers in NB4 cells that were treated with RA or D3 plus

Figure 3. Inhibition of PDGFR causes decreased expression of CD14, CD38, and CD89 in HL-60 cells and elicits similar effects on differentiation markers in

AG1296 (10 Amol/L) treatment for 72 h had no apparent effect on G1-G0 arrest
when compared with vehicle-treated cells. There was also no difference in

or minus AG1296. Similar to results seen in HL-60 cells, AG1296
decreased the RA- or D3-induced expression of CD38 (Fig. 3D).
The effect was significant (P = 0.033) in RA-treated compared with
RA plus AG1296–treated cells. As in experiments using HL-60 cells,
AG1296 increased CD11b expression in RA- or D3-treated cells. D3
plus AG1296–treated cells expressed significantly (P = 0.027) more
CD11b compared with cells treated with D3 alone. Similarly, D3
plus AG1296–treated cells also had significantly (P = 0.039) more
cells capable of inducible oxidative metabolism compared with
cells treated with D3 alone.
AG1296 decreases cells in G0 arrest in response to RA or D3.
Terminally differentiated cells undergo growth arrest. Inhibiting the
PDGFR with AG1296 suppressed the G1-G0 arrest induced by RA
(P = 0.021, RA compared with RA plus AG1296; Fig. 4A) as
determined by DNA histograms generated by flow cytometry.
Cells treated with RA (P = 0.004), D3 (P = 0.05), or D3 plus AG1296
(P = 0.003) all showed significant G1-G0 arrest when compared
with control cells. As for the cell surface differentiation markers,
CD14 and CD89, where AG1296 decreased expression in response
to RA, AG1296 decreased RA-induced G0 arrest but had only a
minimal effect decreasing D3-induced G1-G0.
AG1296 increases ERK1/2 phosphorylation. We aimed to
determine the effect of AG1296 treatment on extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) phosphorylation, which has been
shown to be an essential driver of differentiation of HL-60. RA plus
10 or 20 Amol/L AG1296 had significantly higher pERK phosphorylation compared with RA alone (P = 0.006 and P = 0.003,
respectively). D3 plus 20 Amol/L AG1296 had significantly higher

www.aacrjournals.org

pERK phosphorylation when compared with D3 alone (P = 0.024)
or D3 plus 10 Amol/L AG1296 (P = 0.036). AG1296 thus enhanced
RA- or D3-induced MAPK activation. To address the counterintuitive effect of inhibiting PDGFR on ERK1/2, we also evaluated
ERK1/2 phosphorylation upon short-term exposure to AG1296.
AG1296 did not cause ERK1/2 phosphorylation when applied
for short periods ranging from 10 min to 12 h (data not
shown), indicating that the increase at 24 h is likely a secondary
effect.
Inhibiting the PDGFR increases Ca2+ levels in RA- and D3treated cells. Increased Ca2+ levels have been described to decrease CD38 (19, 20) but increase CD11b (21) expression. At 48 h
RA or D3 posttreatment, Ca2+ was decreased compared with the
control group (Fig. 5). In cells that received AG1296 before RA or
D3 treatment, Ca2+ levels increased (P = 0.049 RA compared with
RA plus AG1296). Although the Ca2+-decreasing effect of RA and D3
was more apparent at later time points (48 and 72 h), we could
detect increased Ca2+ in cells treated with AG1296 and RA or D3 as
early as 3 h posttreatment. Hence, the higher Ca2+ level may have
contributed to the differential effects of AG1296 on differentiation
markers, e.g., CD38 and CD11b.
RA and D3 decrease the expression of the PDGFR. Starting at
24 h RA or D3 posttreatment, the cell surface PDGFR expression
was reduced. The changes were most significant at 72 h posttreatment when RA reduced PDGFR-a and PDGFR-h (Fig. 6A) to 82.5%
and 89.16% of vehicle-treated control cells, respectively. In
D3-treated cells, PDGFR-a and PDGFR-h expression was reduced
to 42.3% (P = 0.024, D3 compared with control) and 62.24%
(P = 0.046, D3 compared with control), respectively. These data
support the notion that lowered PDGFR signaling is promoting
aspects of the differentiation processes.
PDGFR ubiquitination. Although we could not detect any
significant increase in PDGFR-a ubiquitination in cells treated
separately with AG1296, RA, or D3, we observed a dose-dependent
increase of FRET when RA was used with AG1296 (Fig. 6B).
Similarly, we only observed PDGFR-h ubiquitination following
simultaneous treatment with RA and AG1296. These data indicate

calcium levels 48 h posttreatment. However, when 10 Amol/L AG1296 was

untreated control (C ) levels. Columns, means of three independent experiments;

About 10 min of PDGF increased the percentage or pY1021 PDGFRh–positive cells to 73.2% in cells not treated with AG1296 and

PDGFR in Myeloid and Monocytic Differentiation

Discussion
Here, we report that the PDGFR regulates RA- and D3-induced
phenotypic conversion of HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia
cells. Inhibiting PDGFR with AG1296 caused increased expression
of CD11b and CD66ce in response to RA or D3. These cells also had
increased ability to produce reactive oxidative species in response
to TPA and increased substrate adherence. These findings are in
line with previous reports that suggest that PDGF promotes the
undifferentiated, proliferative state of hematopoietic progenitor
cells (12). It has also been observed that PDGF can maintain
human embryonic stem cells in an undifferentiated state (22). Consistent with this are our data on decreased PDGFR-a and PDGFR-h
expression following RA or D3 treatment. PDGFR expression has
been shown to be down-regulated through ubiquitination by the
ubiquitin E3-ligase activity of c-CBL following receptor activation
(23). Our laboratory observed c-CBL expression to be altered in RAand D3-treated HL-60 cells.1 We therefore hypothesized that the
decreased PDGFR expression following RA and D3 treatment is
due to PDGFR ubiquitination and degradation, possibly mediated
by c-CBL. However, RA or D3 treatment did not result in PDGFR
ubiquitination. Only cells receiving RA as well as PDGFR inhibitor
AG1296 showed PDGFR-a and PDGFR-h ubiquitination. It is
unclear why AG1296 did not induce PDGFR ubiquitination in
D3-treated cells.
When examining other differentiation markers, such as CD38,
CD14, CD89 and G1-G0 arrest, we obtained contrasting results
suggesting that the PDGFR pathway is required for these differentiation markers to be expressed. Our data therefore show
that certain differentiation markers seem to be positively regulated by PDGFR signaling, whereas others seem to be negatively
regulated.
Because calcium had been described to decrease CD38 (22, 23)
expression but increase CD11b (24) expression, we also examined
calcium levels in our experimental setting. Ca2+ has been proposed
to mediate negative feedback regulation of CD38 expression.
cADPR, the product of the enzymatic activity of CD38, is capable of
elevating Ca2+ levels (24), whereas intracellular Ca2+ elevations
inhibited CD38 promotor activation (22) and gene expression (23).

Hence, our findings that Ca2+ levels were decreased during RA and
D3 treatment and increased in the presence of AG1296 could cause
divergent responses of differentiation markers such as CD38 and
CD11b.
The PDGFR is implicated in calcium signaling because the
PDGFR can activate PLCg, resulting in the generation of diacylglycerol and IP3 (25). This IP3-mediated calcium release from
intracellular compartments in a rapid and transient Ca2+ elevation
that is most likely unrelated to the prolonged calcium elevation we
observed using the PDGFR inhibitor.
ERK1/2 has a complex role in cellular differentiation. The
prototypic, rapid MAPK signaling is mitogenic (26), yet prolonged
ERK signaling is required for myeloid and monocytic differentiation (17, 18). In the current study, we did not observe a short-term
ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and we cannot exclude the possibility the
late increase in ERK phosphorylation is due to reduced potency of
AG1296 after 24 to 48 h in cell culture media. We have previously
shown that RA and D3 cause long-term ERK phosphorylation,
and that the MAP/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK inhibitor PD98096
blocks RA- and D3-induced differentiation of myeloblastic leukemia cells (18).
Although some differentiation markers are enhanced when
AG1296 is administered along with RA or D3, we believe that there
is a negative net impact of the presence of a PDGFR inhibitor
during RA chemotherapy of APL patients, first, because the ultimate goal of RA treatment in APL patient is to obtain terminal
differentiation and growth arrest. However, our data show that
AG1296 inhibited G0 arrest. Second, we show that AG1296
increases cell adhesion. Increased adhesion could, however,
aggravate retinoic acid syndrome (RAS), a complication of differentiation induction therapy. During RAS, RA causes adhesion
of the leukemic cells to endothelial cells. This results in apoptosis
of endothelial cells and leukocyte infiltration characteristic of
the cardiopulmonary distress in RAS (27).
