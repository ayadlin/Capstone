BACKGROUND: Docetaxel plus prednisone is currently the standard first-line treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate
cancer (mCRPC). The aim of this study was to assess the clinical activity and pharmacodynamic/pharmacogenetic profile of docetaxel plus prednisone in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide in mCRPC patients. METHODS: Forty-one chemotherapynaive patients received docetaxel (60 mg/m2 intravenously every 3 weeks up to 12 cycles) and, from day 2, prednisone 10 mg/day,
celecoxib 400 mg/day, and metronomic cyclophosphamide 50 mg/day, continuously. Plasma VEGF and bFGF were detected by
ELISA. Real-time PCR-SNP analysis of VEGF gene was performed using an ABI PRISM 7900HT SDS and TaqMan SNP genotyping.
RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent of patients were free of progression at 6 months. A decrease in prostate-specific antigen 50% was
observed in 82% of 39 evaluable patients, with a median time to progression of 12.3 months. Grade 3 adverse events were neutropenia (5%), thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, and stomatitis (2.5%). Median PFS and OS were 14.9 months (95% CI, 9.2-15.3 months) and
33.3 months (95% CI, 23-35.6 months), respectively. Of 11 patients (28%) with evaluable disease, 5 (44%) achieved a complete
response, 2 (11%) a partial response, and 2 (11%) stable disease, whereas 2 showed disease progression. The 21154A/G VEGF polymorphism, plasma VEGF, and bFGF after the first cycle of chemotherapy may represent useful pharmacodynamic markers to predict better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of docetaxel and oral metronomic chemotherapy is effective and well tolerated in

INTRODUCTION
Docetaxel is currently the standard first-line treatment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).1 The clinical efficacy of a thrice-weekly docetaxel-based chemotherapy regimen in chemo-naive patients with mCRPC has been demonstrated by 2 randomized phase III trials (ie, the TAX-327 study and the SWOG 99-16 study), resulting in a median survival
benefit of 2-3 months compared with the schedule of mitoxantrone and prednisone.2,3 To improve the docetaxel impact on
overall survival (OS), numerous classes of agents have been combined with docetaxel in phase II/III studies in CRPC, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ie, erlotinib and dasatinib),4,5 antiangiogenic agents (ie, bevacizumab and aflibercept),6,7 endothelin A receptor antagonists (ie, zibotentan),8 BCL-2 inhibitors (ie, AT-101),9 immunologic agents such as vaccines,10,11
and vitamin D analogues like calcitriol.12 In few cases, promising rates of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response, tumor
response, and progression-free survival (PFS), have been reported. However, some of these combinations caused increased
toxicity without any prolongation of OS, as revealed in the results of completed phase III trials.6,7
Therefore, a major area of interest in clinical research and practice is the search for effective combined treatments for
CRPC, which should be well tolerated and be able to produce long-term control of the disease (thus delaying the need for
further therapies). In that regard, metronomic administration of chemotherapy — the continuous low-dose administration
of chemotherapeutics — has been extensively studied for its antiangiogenic13 and antitumor properties in preclinical prostate
models.14,15 Several phase II trials have demonstrated the clinical activity of metronomic cyclophosphamide (CTX) and the
good toxicity profile for this type of treatment in prostate cancer patients.16-18 Recently, our group has successfully applied a
new regimen of metronomic oral CTX, dexamethasone, and celecoxib (CXB) preceded by a single maximum-tolerated dose

of CTX in advanced pretreated CRPC patients.19 In that
study, PSA levels decreased by 50% in 30% of patients,
the median PFS and OS were 3 and 21 months, respectively, and no grade 3-4 adverse events were observed. Similar results were also observed in a cohort of elderly (aged
78 years) CRPC patients.20 Based on our previous experiences,19,20 in the present study we tested for a therapeutic
benefit from the combination of docetaxel plus prednisone
with metronomic CTX plus CXB as a first-line treatment
for mCRPC. The aims of this present study were to assess
the response of mCRPC patients treated with the docetaxel
plus prednisone standard treatment followed by an oral
metronomic CTX regimen with CXB. Specifically, we
assessed clinical activity, and patient responses in relation
to pharmacodynamic parameters and to pharmacogenetic
profiles. These included plasma VEGF and bFGF levels
and patient VEGF SNP genotypes.

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study Design and Patient Selection

The present multicenter, prospective, nonrandomized
phase II clinical study was approved by the local ethics
committee and was registered in the European Clinical
Trial Database EudraCT (registration number 2006604478-29). Patients were informed of the investigational
nature of the study and provided their written informed
consent for the study treatment and for the related procedures. Eligibility criteria at baseline included age 18
years, histological diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma,
hormone-refractory metastatic disease, and chemotherapy
naive. Other inclusion criteria were the measurable disease
progression and/or increasing PSA serum level in 2 consecutive measurements at least 1 week apart and in accordance with the recommendations by the Prostate Cancer
Clinical Trials Working Group 1,21 PSA 10 ng/mL;
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(ECOG PS) of 2; adequate bone marrow function (leukocytes, 3000/mL; neutrophil count, 1500/mL; hemoglobin level, 10 g/dL; platelets, 100,000/mL);
adequate liver function (total serum bilirubin level,
<1.5 mg/dl; aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, <3 upper limit of normal); adequate renal
function (serum creatinine level, <1.5 mg/dl), and life expectancy 3 months. Antiandrogen therapy (flutamide
and bicalutamide) was discontinued at least 4 weeks
before enrollment, at which point evidence for PSA progression was required. The use of low-dose megestrol acetate for the amelioration of symptoms was allowed.
Luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) ana3924

logues, corticosteroids, and zoledronic acid were allowed
if started at least 4 weeks before the study and associated
with a rising PSA. Exclusion criteria at baseline were
uncontrolled metabolic diseases, cardiovascular disease
(uncontrolled hypertension and arrhythmia, myocardial
infarction within 2 years before enrolment, unstable angina, New York Heart Association, grade II or greater
congestive heart failure), active infections, high risk of
thromboembolic events without prophylactic treatments,
untreated haemorrhagic gastric disease, or presence of
brain metastases.
Treatment

All eligible patients on day 1 received docetaxel (60 mg/
m2 intravenously every 3 weeks up to 12 cycles) and from
day 2 continuously: prednisone 10 mg/day, CXB 200 mg
orally twice a day, and metronomic CTX 50 mg/day.
Chemotherapy with docetaxel was given up to 12 cycles,
or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
patient’s refusal to continue. Treatment with metronomic
CTX, CXB, and prednisone was administered continuously until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or
refusal by the patient to continue treatment.
Clinical Evaluation

Pretreatment evaluations were patient’s medical history; a
physical exam that included an assessment of weight, vital
signs, and ECOG PS; electrocardiogram plus cardiovascular examinations; complete blood count; complete serum
biochemistry (ie, creatinine, glycemia, sodium, potassium,
calcium, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, cGT, ALP, total bilirubin,
PT, aPTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer), PSA serum levels;
pain evaluation according to the visual analog scale
(VAS), and measurable disease evaluation, if applicable.
During treatment, every 2 weeks, each patient underwent
the following evaluations: physical examination, toxicity
(NCI-CTC) record, blood count, serum creatinine, and
every 4 weeks blood count, partial serum biochemistry (ie,
creatinine, total bilirubin, calcium, PT, aPTT, fibrinogen,
and D-dimer), and every 8 weeks electrocardiogram,
physical and cardiovascular examination, toxicity (NCICTC) record, blood count, complete serum biochemistry,
and measurable disease evaluation. PSA serum levels were
measured every 2 weeks.

on day 21 after initiation of therapy. On day 21, samples
were taken before the administration of docetaxel infusion. Plasma samples were analyzed by immunoenzymatic
assays for total concentration of vascular endothelial
growth factor-A (VEGF-A), basic fibroblast growth factor
(bFGF), and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) from Quantikine,
DVE00, DFB50, and DANG20, respectively (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The experimental procedures
were carried out according to the ELISA kit protocol,
which was standardized and validated by the manufacturer. Optical density was determined using a Multiskan
Spectrum microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Milan,
Italy) set to 450 nm (with a wavelength correction of
540 nm). The results were expressed as picograms of
VEGF-A, bFGF, and Ang-2 per milliliter of plasma.
DNA extraction and VEGF-A genotyping

Blood samples (3 mL) were collected in EDTA tubes at
the time of the first visit. Genomic DNA was available
from the blood samples of 30 patients. DNA extraction
was performed using a QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA).
Allelic discrimination of VEGF-A 22578A/C
(rs699947), 21154 A/G (rs1570360), 2634C/G
(rs2010963), and 1936C/T (rs3025039) was performed
using an ABI PRISM 7900 HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) and with validated TaqMan SNP genotyping assays (Applied
Biosystems), as previously published.22 PCR reactions
were carried out according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
SNP Selection

The 4 VEGF-A SNPs included in our study were selected
on the basis of 2 main considerations: 1) the 4 SNPs had
been previously and significantly associated with therapeutic efficacy of antiangiogenic drugs (eg, bevacizumab
or metronomic chemotherapy) in prostate and other tumor types,22,23 and 2) each SNP had been associated with
modulation of VEGF-A expression or with different
plasma levels of VEGF-A.24,25
End Points and Response Criteria

The primary end point of the study was the rate of
patients free of progression at 6 months. The estimation
of progression-free survival at 6 months was as follows:
patients free of biochemical (PSA) and instrumental
(imaging) progression at 6 months after the beginning of
treatment; for patients with unmeasurable disease only
the biochemical (PSA) progression was considered.
Cancer

December 15, 2014

Secondary end points were the PSA-based outcome
defined by a decrease 50% from baseline, maintained
for at least 4 weeks, in accordance with the consensus
guidelines of the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working
Group. PSA progression was defined as a 50% or greater
increase and an absolute increase of 5 ng/mL or more
from the nadir, which was confirmed by a second value
obtained 2 or more weeks later. Where no decline from
baseline was documented, PSA progression was defined as
a 25% confirmed increase from the baseline value along
with an increase in the absolute value of 5 ng/mL. Other
secondary end points were the objective response rate
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST) criteria, toxicity (NCI-CTC), duration of PSA response, time to PSA progression, pain control (VAS), overall survival (OS), plasma VEGF-A,
bFGF, and Ang-2 levels, and VEGF-A genotyping.
Statistical Analyses

According to the “single-stage design,” Fleming, as
amended by A’Hern, P0 5 50% and P1 5 70%, and error
a 5 .05 and b 5 .20, we expected to add 37 evaluable
patients in the study, and, if in at least 24 of these patients,
we did not observed progression within 6 months of treatment, then the results were considered interesting and
deserving of further study. Response duration was calculated from the time of first objective response to the time
of disease progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
OS were calculated from the date of first chemotherapy
administration to the date of progression or death/lost to
follow-up, respectively. PFS and OS were analyzed by
GraphPad Prism software (package version 5.0; GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), using the product
limit method of Kaplan and Meier and comparing survival curves using both the log-rank test and the GehanWilcoxon test. The log-rank test was also used to test differences in PFS between subgroup of patients; cutoff values for each marker were set at the 50th (VEGF and Ang2) or 75th (bFGF) percentile as previously described.26
For the pharmacogenetic analyses, we used the Bonferroni
correction to account for multiple testing, and a 2-tailed
P < .0125 (5 0.05/4 SNPs) was considered statistically
significant.22
RESULTS
Characteristics of the Patients and Toxicity

From March 2006 to April 2010, 41 patients were enrolled in this study. Baseline patient characteristics are
listed in Table 1. Median number of docetaxel cycles
delivered was 12 (range, 1-12), and median duration of

metronomic CTX plus prednisone and CXB was 958
days (range, 77-1353 days). All patients were evaluable for
toxicity. Main grade 3 hematologic or nonhematologic
toxicities were: neutropenia (2 patient; 5%), thrombocytopenia, diarrhea, stomatitis, dyspnea, peripheral edema,
skin rash, and onycholysis (1 patient; 2,5%). Only 1
patient experienced grade 4 onycholysis (2,5%), and
another patient (2.5%) had an allergic reaction to docetaxel that required discontinuation from the study. Neither major cardiovascular events nor toxicity-related
deaths were observed (Table 2).
Activity

Thirty-nine patients were assessable for clinical activity.
The rate of patients free of progression at 6 months was
87%. Thirty-two patients (82%) showed a PSA decrease
50% and 34 (87%) any PSA decrease (corresponding to
a 4%-100% decrease). According to RECIST criteria, we
observed 5 complete responses, 2 partial responses, 2 stable disease, and 2 progression of disease. The 5 patients
with a complete response had a single site of metastatic
disease: 4 patients presented with disease in the lymph
nodes, whereas 1 patient had histologically confirmed
metastatic disease in the liver. These patients presented a
minimum of 2 lesions and a maximum of 5 lesions that
ranged between 16 and 53 mm of maximum diameter.
The median time to PSA progression was 12.3
months (range, 1-29 months). Figure 1 shows the waterfall plot; this reflects the maximal PSA change from baseline at 12 weeks of treatment for nonresponding patients
3926

or at any time for responding patients. Median PFS and
OS were 14.9 months (95% CI, 9.2-15.3 months; Fig.
2A) and 33.3 months (95% CI, 23-35.6 months; Fig.
2B), respectively.
Pharmacodynamic Evaluations

Pharmacodynamic analyses were performed for 25
patients. The plasma samples were collected before and after 21 days of the combined docetaxel plus metronomic
schedule. A significant increase of PFS (20.8 vs 12.2
months; P 5 .0314) was found in those patients who, after the first cycle of treatment, had plasma levels of bFGF
>13 pg/mL (cutoff, 75th percentile; Fig. 3A). Moreover,
according to the plasma levels of VEGF-A after the first
cycle of treatment, a significant increase in PFS (16.5 vs
11.1 months; P 5 .042) was observed in patients with
plasma levels of VEGF >129 pg/mL (cutoff, 50th percentile; Fig. 3B), whereas no significant differences were
found between the PFS (14.6 vs 13.3 months; P 5 .6341)
of patients who, after the first cycle of treatment, had
plasma levels of Ang-2 either above or below 610.5 pg/
mL (cutoff, 50th percentile; Fig. 3C). No significant differences in OS were found in our population using the
cutoff values of VEGF, bFGF, and Ang-2; and no significant correlations were noticed between VEGF or bFGF
plasma levels on day 21 and overall survivals of patients
(Supplementary Fig. 1A,B, respectively).
Another relevant finding of our study was the identification of a VEGF-A genotype that was significantly associated with PFS in 30 patients. Indeed, with regard to
PFS, patients harboring the VEGF 21154AA genotype
had a median PFS of 11.1 months, whereas patients with
VEGF 21154AG/GG genotypes had a significant (by
Bonferroni correction) longer survival (23.7 months;
P 5 .0028; Fig. 4). No significant differences were found
in OS for the VEGF 21154AA genotype. Nor did we
find any significant differences in PFS and OS for the
other genotypes.
DISCUSSION
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of the combination of docetaxel and prednisone plus
a metronomic chemotherapy regimen including CTX,
and CXB. We observed that 87% of patients (n 5 34)
were free of progression 6 months from the beginning of
treatment, far beyond our target number (at least 24 of 37
treated patients), with a median PFS of 14.9 months and
a median OS of 33.3 months. Our results suggest an important antitumor activity of the combination of docetaxel plus a CTX-based metronomic regimen, comparable

to — or even better than — those observed in the same
setting for patients treated with docetaxel and other drugs,
such as thalidomide, bevacizumab, calcitriol, dasatinib,
aflibercept, erlotinib, AT-101, estramustine, and carboplatin.27 Moreover, the toxicity profile observed in our
patients was similar to the one previously observed with
docetaxel alone.3,28 Indeed, previous clinical experiences
showed that docetaxel-based combination treatments in
this setting produce median progression-free survival
ranging from 5.9 (docetaxel plus thalidomide) to 11.8
(docetaxel plus dasatinib) months, with a median overall
survival ranging from 15.6 (docetaxel plus estramustine)
to 28.9 (docetaxel plus thalidomide) months.4-6,9,28-33
Interestingly, as stated by Clarke, these combined treatments enhance the side effects of docetaxel, and when
they produce additive effects, they are attained at considerable financial costs.27 For example, the addition of estramustine resulted in an increased risk of

from baseline (at 12 weeks for those not responding or at any
time for those responding) of 39 patients.

thromboembolism and a worsening of gastrointestinal
toxicity.33 Similarly, the inclusion of aflibercept to the
docetaxel/prednisone regimen produced a higher incidence of grade 3-4 gastrointestinal disorders, hemorrhagic
events, hypertension, fatigue, infections and treatmentrelated fatal adverse events, but no improvement in overall
survival.6 Thus, Tannock and colleagues concluded that
docetaxel plus prednisone remains the standard treatment
for mCRPC patients who need first-line chemotherapy.6
Interestingly, our study shows that together with increased
PFS and OS, there is no worsening of toxicity or emergence of new adverse reactions. For these reasons, a
randomized phase III clinical trial is urgently needed to
verify the findings from this study, which may open a new
therapeutic strategy in the field of first-line chemotherapy
of mCRPC.
Metronomic CTX is a promising approach for the
palliative treatment of solid tumors,17 including prostate
cancer,16 because it has good activity and produces minimal toxicity in elderly and frail patients.34 Recently, in a
translational study, Cardillo et al suggested that metronomic CTX could be an excellent adjuvant to first-line
docetaxel standard therapy because it increases the bioavailability of docetaxel and, therefore, should allow for a
reduction of docetaxel dosage with expected reduced side
effects.35 In our clinical trial, the association of standard
docetaxel chemotherapy immediately followed by the
metronomic CTX regimen was drawn by the preclinical
results of Shaked et al,36 who showed superior antitumor
activity by combining intermittent high-bolus doses plus
continuous low doses of CTX in a prostate PC-3 tumor
model, and by the seminal work of Pietras and Hanahan,

who used a “chemo-switch” regimen consisting of an initial short course of maximum tolerated CTX dose, followed by long-term low-dose oral CTX.37 Indeed, a
possible explanation for our clinical data could reside in
3928

the cytotoxicity of the standard docetaxel dose against rapidly proliferating tumor cells and against cycling tumor
endothelial cells, followed by the subsequent antiangiogenic activity of metronomic chemotherapy. Such

antiangiogenic activity would occur via inhibition of
migration/proliferation of endothelial cells in situ and the
blockade of activated circulating precursors of endothelial
cells.38 The treatment on day 1 with docetaxel 60 mg/m2
intravenously every 3 weeks causes an antivascular effect,
as well as various subsequent treatment-induced adaptive
changes that may explain why these antivascular effects —
if the drug is administered alone — are not the principal
mechanism of antitumor activity of docetaxel at standard
doses. In fact, standard chemotherapy has been shown to
induce the expression and secretion of proangiogenic factors such as VEGF and bFGF by tumor cells.39 These factors can support neoangiogenesis during the
chemotherapy-free break period, and they can render endothelial cells more resistant to the effects of chemotherapeutics such as taxanes.40 Moreover, a wave of endothelial
cell precursors and other proangiogenic bone marrow–
derived cells is mobilized during hematological recovery
in the chemotherapy-free break period.39,41 Thus, a possible way to impair these processes and to enhance
chemotherapy-related antivascular effects is the combined
use of standard chemotherapy with metronomic chemotherapy, as we present in this study. Therefore, the association of docetaxel with metronomic CTX may prevent, or
better control, the rebound neovascularization induced by
bFGF and/or VEGF. Such a combination therapy works
better, in terms of PFS in those patients with higher levels
of VEGF and bFGF secreted by tumor cells after the first
cycle of standard chemotherapy, as shown by our data.
We hypothesized that those neoplasms that are more deCancer

December 15, 2014

pendent on angiogenesis for their growth, survival, and
metastases are more sensitive to the antiangiogenic activity
of the metronomic CTX and CXB combination.39
CXB has shown antiangiogenic properties42 and
antitumor and antimetastatic activities in mouse models
of prostate adenocarcinoma when administered at the
standard human dose,43 as a result of both COX-2independent and COX-2-dependent mechanisms.44 Furthermore, CXB clinical trials in patients with PSA recurrence have shown interesting activity in terms of slowing
PSA kinetics without relevant toxicities,45 and our group
has successfully investigated a metronomic regimen of
oral cyclophosphamide and CXB in advanced pretreated
CRPC patients.19 Moreover, results from Albouy and colleagues46 showed a significant reduction in hematological
toxicity with biweekly docetaxel administration combined
with CXB. Regarding the cardiovascular risk of celecoxib,
it has been reported that a dose-dependent increase in cardiovascular event rates was observed in patients administered celecoxib compared with placebo.47 Furthermore, a
recent meta-analysis of 6 celecoxib placebo-controlled
randomized clinical trials confirmed this dose-dependent
cardiovascular risk but with a nonsignificant hazard for
the dose of 400 mg/day,48 which is the one we used in our
study.
The pharmacogenetic part of our study is consistent
with the pharmacodynamic findings. Thus, despite the limitation that the correlation between PFS and VEGF genotypes was assessed on a small number of patients
(n 5 30) and in a single-arm clinical study, we found that
VEGF 21154AA genotype patients have a significantly
shorter PFS. Interestingly, reduced VEGF transcription
has been associated with the VEGF 21154A allele and
AA genotype,49,50 suggesting that tumors with the VEGF
21154 AG/GG genetic background may produce higher
VEGF-A levels after the administration of standard chemotherapy. Therefore, on the basis of our data, we suggest
that plasma values of VEGF and bFGF at the end of the
first cycle of chemotherapy and/or VEGF genotyping
may be used to predict which patients will have greater
PFS benefits from the combination with metronomic
therapy.
In conclusion, the combination of docetaxel and
prednisone plus metronomic CTX and CXB is effective as
first-line treatment in patients with mCRPC and it has a
favorable toxicity profile. The 21154A/G VEGF polymorphism, VEGF and bFGF plasma levels after the first cycle
of chemotherapy may represent useful pharmacogenetic/
pharmacodynamic markers to predict a better outcome.
The present prospective phase II clinical trial is a pilot

investigation, and both clinical and pharmacodynamic/
pharmacogenetic data are exploratory by nature. The results
and the statistical significances should be interpreted with
caution because their translation to a larger patient population might be much less important. Our results can nevertheless be useful for the generation of hypotheses that can
be tested in subsequent investigations. Thus, serious considerations should be given to testing this combination in a
larger patient population (ie, a randomized phase II clinical
trial) in order to establish its real clinical impact.
