Abstract
Signals from the tumor suppressors PTEN and LKB1 converge on mTOR to negatively regulate its function in
cancer cells. Notably, both of these suppressors are attenuated in a signiﬁcant fraction of human endometrial
tumors. In this study, we generated a genetic mouse model of endometrial cancer driven by concomitant loss of
these suppressors to gain pathophysiological insight into this disease. Dual loss of Pten and Lkb1 in the
endometrial epithelium led to rapid development of advanced endometrioid endometrial tumors with 100%
penetrance and short host survival. The tumors displayed dysregulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt
and Lkb1/Ampk signaling with hyperactivation of mTOR signaling. Treatment with a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor,
BEZ235, extended the time before tumor onset and prolonged overall survival. The PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 used
as a single agent reduced the growth rate of primary tumor implants in Pten/Lkb1-deﬁcient mice, and the mTOR
inhibitor RAD001 was unexpectedly as effective as BEZ235 in triggering tumor regression. In parallel, we also
found that ectopic expression of LKB1 in PTEN/LKB1-deﬁcient human endometrial cancer cells increased their
sensitivity to PI3K inhibition. Together, our results demonstrated that Pten/Lkb1-deﬁcient endometrial tumors
rely strongly on deregulated mTOR signaling, and they provided evidence that LKB1 status may modulate the
response of PTEN-deﬁcient tumors to PI3K or mTOR inhibitors. Cancer Res; 74(1); 15–23. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological
malignancy in the United States, with more than 40,000 new
cases diagnosed and 7,000 deaths, annually (1). Aberrant
activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling
pathway is frequently observed in a wide array of human
cancers, including endometrial cancer (2–9). PI3Ks are central
regulators of many essential cellular processes, including cell
growth, proliferation, survival, and metabolism (2, 4, 10). Two

common causes of aberrant activation of these regulators are
activating mutations of PIK3CA (encoding the p110a catalytic
subunit of PI3K) and loss-of-function mutations of the tumor
suppressor PTEN: the consequence of either mutation is an
accumulation of phosphoatidylinositol (3, 4, 5). P3 at cell
membranes, and subsequent constitutive activation of AKT,
which in turn leads to upregulation of downstream targets of
AKT, including the mTOR. Strikingly, recent comprehensive
genomic characterization has identiﬁed activating mutations
of PIK3CA and inactivating mutations or loss of PTEN in 53%
and 67% of endometrial cancer (11) respectively, justifying the
need to fully understand the importance of PI3K-signaling
axis and AKT/mTOR activation in the pathogenesis of this
malignancy.
In addition to PTEN, the LKB1 tumor suppressor pathway
also negatively regulates mTOR signaling. Germline defects of
LKB1 result in Peutz–Jegher Syndrome (PJS), a disorder that is
characterized by intestinal hamartomas (12). Patients with PJS
are at higher risks for epithelial cancers, including endometrial
cancer (13), suggesting a tumor suppressive role of LKB1. LKB1
is a master upstream kinase of at least 13 downstream AMPKrelated kinases (14): among these, AMPK is of central importance as a downstream effector of LKB1; AMPK suppresses the
mTOR signaling pathway via phosphorylation of the tuberous
sclerosis complex components 1 (TSC1) and 2 (TSC2; ref. 15).
Loss of LKB1 protein expression is reported for 21% of primary
endometrial tumors, and is correlated with activation of the

mTOR pathway (16). Unlike PTEN whose loss can be caused by
mutation, promoter methylation, and protein degradation
(3, 17–19), mutation and homozygous deletion of LKB1 is a
relatively rare event in endometrial cancer (3, 20) and the
mechanism underlying decreased LKB1 protein level is
unclear.
Genetic studies of mouse models have been critical for
gaining insight into the role of speciﬁc genetic alterations in
endometrial tumorigenesis (21). In one such model, biallelic
deletion of Pten in mouse uterus was achieved by crossing Pten
ﬂoxed mice with mice that express Cre recombinase under the
control of the progesterone receptor promoter (PR cre/þ;
ref. 22): female offspring (as young as 1 month of age) from
these breedings developed invasive endometrial cancer (22).
However, because PTEN inactivation driven by PR-cre occurs
during early embryogenesis (as early as embryonic day 10), and
because progesterone receptor is also expressed in the stroma,
this mouse model failed to faithfully mimic sporadic endometrial cancer in humans. In an alternative approach, somatic
deletion of individual genes in the endometrium was achieved
by delivering adenovirus-expressing Cre into the uterine lumen
(23). With use of this method, recent studies in genetic mouse
models have shown that somatic deletion of either Pten or
Lkb1 speciﬁcally in the endometrium induces endometrial
tumorigenesis with partial penetrance (20, 24). However, the
effect of somatic loss of both tumor suppressors on the
development of endometrial tumors has not been studied.
Intense efforts have been focused on developing inhibitors
that target PI3K, AKT, and mTOR, which are major nodes in the
PI3K pathway, and several such inhibitors are currently being
evaluated in clinical trials for treating a variety of human
cancers (2, 4, 5, 25), including endometrial cancer. Hence
understanding the extent to which individual nodes involved
in the PI3K pathway participate in tumorigenesis, and the
mechanisms responsible for the aberrant activation of the PI3K
pathway, is important for designing effective therapeutics for
patients suffering from endometrial cancer (www.clinicaltrials.
gov). PTEN and LKB1 are known to converge and suppress
mTOR signaling; therefore, we hypothesize that loss of both
suppressors in endometrium leads to hyperactivation of their
downstream signaling and manifests as a worse disease phenotype. Here we test this hypothesis by evaluating the consequence of somatic concurrent loss of Pten and Lkb1 in mouse
endometrium, and by assessing the effectiveness of PI3K
and/or mTOR inhibitors, currently in preclinical and clinical
use, in treating malignancy of this tissue.

Materials and Methods
Experimental mice and Ade-cre administration
Ptenloxp/loxp mice (Dr. Hong Wu, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA) and
Lkb1loxp/loxp mice (NCI Mouse Repository) were fully backcrossed to FVB strain background. To generate compound
mice, Ptenloxp/loxp mice were ﬁrst crossed with Lkb1loxp/loxp
mice to generate Ptenloxp/þLkb1loxp/þ. These resulting heterozygous mice were then intercrossed to generate Ptenloxp/loxp
Lkb1loxp/loxp mice. All mouse experiments were carried out in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committees of Dana-Farber Cancer

Institute and Harvard Medical School. Intrauterine adenovirus
expression Cre (Ade-Cre) injections were done in female mice
at the age of 8 to 12 weeks as described (23) with the following
modiﬁcations: 5 mL of plaque-forming units (pfu) Ade-Cre
(5  107 pfu; University of Iowa, Iowa City, IA) with 0.1% Evans
blue (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.) was injected through the right uterine
horn into the lumen whereas the left uterine horn was
uninjected.
Histology and Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were ﬁxed in formalin overnight before parafﬁn
embedding. Parafﬁn blocks were sectioned and stained with
H&E at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center Rodent Histopathology Core. Immunohistochemistry was carried out using
the antibodies Ki67 (Vector), p-Akt (Ser473; Invitrogen), p-S6rp
(Cell Signaling), cleaved caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), p-Ampk (Cell
Signaling), p-ACC (Cell Signaling), Pten (Cell Signaling), Lkb1
(Santa Cruz), and CK8 (Troma-1, University of Iowa).
Tumor grafting and in vivo treatment studies
Endometrial tumors were isolated from Ptenloxp/loxp
Lkb1loxp/loxp mice 10 weeks after Ade-Cre injection. The minced
tumor tissue was grafted into the ﬂanking region of nude mice
(NcrNu females, 8-week-old, Taconic) subcutaneously. The
mice were given the dosages of the inhibitors as indicated in
the ﬁgure legends by oral gavage. BEZ235 and RAD001 were
obtained from Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research
(Basel, Switzerland), whereas GDC-0941 was purchased from
MedChemexpress. GDC-0941 was dissolved in 0.5% methylcellulose/0.2% Tween 80, BEZ235 was dissolved in 10% NMP/
90% PEG300 and RAD001 was formulated at 2% (w/v) in a
microemulsion vehicle (Novartis). Tumor volumes were measured twice a week with calipers and calculated according to
the following formula: tumor volume ¼ (length  width2)/2.

dilutions of GDC-0941. Cell proliferation was assessed after 72
hours of treatment by the WST-1 assay (Roche).
Western blot analysis
Tumors were homogenized in ice-cold RIPA buffer (Sigma)
containing protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). For tumor and cell lysates, standard
Western blotting was conducted as described (37) using antibodies against p-AKT (Ser473), p-AKT(Thr308), p-S6RP

Results
Concurrent low abundance of PTEN and LKB1 found in a
fraction of human endometrial cancers
Previous studies have reported frequent alterations of PTEN
in endometrial cancer, and shown association of decreased

LKB1 protein with advanced disease stage (3, 16–20). However,
it was unclear whether concurrent loss of PTEN and LKB1
exists in endometrial cancer. Here we evaluated the abundance
of PTEN and LKB1 proteins by RPPA analysis on a large cohort
of primary endometrial tumors (Fig. 1A). The abundance of
each protein, PTEN or LKB1, was deﬁned as high, intermediate,
or low. Low abundance of PTEN and LKB1 was found in 35%
(56/159) and 28% (44/159) of endometrioid cancers, respectively, consistent with the previous ﬁndings that loss of Pten
and Lkb1 are both frequent events in patients with endometrial
cancer (3, 9, 16, 20, 27). Although the observed frequency of
coexisting low abundance of PTEN and LKB1 (6.3%) is lower
than the expected frequency (8.8%) in grade 1 and grade 2
tumors, the observed frequency of coexistence (14.9%) is higher
than the expected frequency (12.0%) in grade 3 tumors, suggesting there is an enrichment of concurrent low abundance of
PTEN and LKB1 in high-grade tumors. This ﬁnding prompted
us to investigate the potential cooperative effect of these 2
events on the pathogenesis of endometrial cancer.

Concurrent deletion of Pten and Lkb1 in endometrium
resulted in rapid development of aggressive endometrial
tumors
Pten and Lkb1 have been revealed as potent tumor suppressors of endometrial cancer in experimental mouse models (16, 20, 22–24, 28), both of which also converge on and
negatively regulate mTOR signaling. To determine whether
deregulation of these 2 pathways may have a cooperative
impact on endometrial carcinogenesis, we used a previously
described in vivo approach (23) to conditionally delete targeted genes in the endometrial epithelium of mice homozygous for ﬂoxed alleles of Pten and/or Lkb1 (Pten loxp/loxp
and/or Lkb1loxp/loxp). Cohorts of Ptenloxp/loxp (n ¼ 6),
Lkb1loxp/loxp (n ¼ 8), or Ptenloxp/loxp Lkb1loxp/loxp (n ¼ 23) mice
were administered with adenovirus expressing Cre (Ade-Cre)
into the lumen of the right uterine horn at 8 to 12 weeks of
age. Between 8 to 28 weeks after Ade-Cre injection,
Ptenloxp/loxp Lkb1loxp/loxp mice presented with overt disease
state, including palpable tumor mass, abdominal bloating,
and decreased mobility. These mice developed tumors in the
uterine horn injected with Ade-cre but not in the contralateral, uninjected uterine horn, with 100% penetrance and a
median survival of 127 days after Ade-Cre injection (Fig. 1B).
Substantial hemorrhagic ascites in the peritoneal cavity were
found in 69.5% (16/23) of the mice at necropsy (Fig. 1C).
Strikingly, in 52.2% (12/23) cases, the uterine cancer cells even
broke away from the uterus and invaded adjacent organs such
as liver and peritoneal wall (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cremediated recombination resulted in null alleles of Pten and
Lkb1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistently, both Pten and
Lkb1 proteins were found lost in epithelial tumor cells but
remained evident in the surrounding stromal cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, no apparent phenotype or
mortality was observed from either Ptenloxp/loxp or
Lkb1loxp/loxp mice following administration of Ade-Cre for up
to 10 months (Supplementary Table S1). Subsequent histopathological examination identiﬁed hyperplastic lesions in
Pten-deﬁcient uterus but well-differentiated endometrial cancer lesions in Lkb1-deﬁcient uterus with partial penetrance
(Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6 and Table S1), the latter of
which is consistent with a previous report (20). Together, the
complete penetrance and short latency of tumorigenesis seen
in this mouse model suggest that cooperating genetic abnormalities in both Pten and Lkb1 are sufﬁcient to form fully
malignant endometrial tumors.
Histologically, the uterine tumors developed in
Ptenloxp/loxpLkb1loxp/loxp were aggressive endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The endometrial layer has lost
well-differentiated glandular structures as those seen in
normal uterus and the chaotically growing endometrial
epithelial cells were often moderately to poorly differentiated in nature and tightly intermingled with collagen-rich
stroma (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S7). In all cases,
endometrial cells were seen to completely invade through
the entire myometrial wall and reach the serosal surface of
the uterus (Fig. 1D). Histological analyses also identiﬁed
macroscopic metastases with endometrioid glandular morphology in the lung in 65.2% (15/23) of cases (Supplementary

18

Cancer Res; 74(1) January 1, 2014

Fig. S8), strongly supportive of a high metastatic potential of
this tumor model. Of note, in some areas of the endometrial
tumors, we also noticed the stroma adjacent to the invasive
adenocarcinoma exhibits a desmoplastic response resembling those seen in human cancer (Supplementary Fig. S9).
Together, the tumor driven by combined endometrial-speciﬁc loss of Pten and Lkb1 represents a mouse model of
highly invasive endometrial cancer that recapitulates the
advanced stage of the human disease and thus provides a
useful platform for preclinical testing of molecularly targeted therapeutics in treating human high-grade endometrioid endometrial cancer.
Dysregulated signaling pathways in endometrial tumors
driven by concurrent loss of Pten and Lkb1
To assess signaling alterations in Pten Lkb1-deﬁcient endometrial tumors, we analyzed the in vivo signaling cascades
known to be downstream of Pten and Lkb1. Lkb1 is known to
directly phosphorylate and activate Ampk to suppress mTOR
pathway (15). Consistent with this, the normal endometrial
glands revealed strong phosphorylation of Ampk (Thr172;
Supplementary Fig. S10). In contrast, phosphorylation of
AMPK and ACC is almost completely abolished in endometrial
tumors, suggesting that these tumors have lost the Lkb1-Ampk
signaling axis that controls mTOR activity. AKT, a serine–
threonine kinase, is known to be aberrantly phosphorylated
and activated in response to PI3K activation as a result of Pten
loss (10). In line with this, we found signiﬁcantly increased
levels of p-AKT in endometrial tumors (Supplementary Fig.
S10). mTOR and S6RP, a downstream effector of mTOR, which
are downstream of both AKT and AMPK, are strongly phosphorylated, consistent with aberrant activation of mTOR signaling because of concomitant loss of Pten and Lkb1. The
dysregulated Lkb1/Ampk signaling and hyperactivated AKT/
mTOR signaling seen in the endometrial tumors raises the
possibility that these tumors might be dependent on PI3K-AKT
and mTOR signaling pathways for maintenance of the malignant phenotype and thus hypersensitive to inhibition of particular nodes in the signaling pathway and in particular those
downstream of the TSC1/2 convergence point for both
pathways.
Dual inhibition of PI3K and mTOR effectively treated
Pten Lkb1-deﬁcient endometrial tumors
We next evaluated the effect of NVP-BEZ235, a potent dual
kinase inhibitor that targets both PI3K and mTOR. We administered Ade-cre to the uterine lumen of a cohort of Ptenloxp/loxp
Lkb1loxp/loxp mice. At 5 weeks after Ade-cre administration,
drug treatment by BEZ235 (35 mg/kg/day) or vehicle was
initiated. Strikingly, 6 weeks of BEZ235 treatment greatly
decreased disease progression, as evidenced by a signiﬁcant
decrease in uterine weight of mice in the drug-treated group
when compared with those in the vehicle-treated group (Fig.
2A and B, panels a and b, P < 0.0005). By the end of 3 months'
drug treatment, all remaining mice in the vehicle-treated
group succumbed to death whereas all remaining BEZ235treated mice survived (Fig. 2C, P < 0.0005). Thus, BEZ235
signiﬁcantly prolonged survival, representing a promising

molecular-targeted therapeutics in treating endometrial cancer driven by concurrent loss of Pten and Lkb1. Furthermore,
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that there was a
marked decrease in the abundance of both p-AKT and pS6RP in the endometrial cancers treated with BEZ235 (Fig.
2D), consistent with inhibition of both PI3K and mTOR by
this drug. We also found that the cell proliferation as
measured by Ki67 staining signiﬁcantly decreased in endometrial tumors treated with BEZ235 (Fig. 2E). Conversely,
the apoptotic cell death as assessed by cleaved caspase-3
markedly increased in BEZ235-treated tumors (Fig. 2E).
Therefore, decreased cellular proliferation and increased
apoptosis are, at least in part, responsible for the inhibited
tumor growth in mice treated with BEZ235.

Differential responses of Pten Lkb1-deﬁcient
endometrial tumors to inhibitors targeting PI3K and/or
mTOR
Loss of Pten function confers cancer cells increased sensitivity to PI3K or mTOR inhibition, each as a single agent (29–
32). Meanwhile, it has been recently shown that Lkb1 is critical
in suppressing mTOR-mediated endometrial cancer (20, 28).
We next determined if endometrial tumors driven by combined inactivation of both Pten and Lkb1 are sensitive to
selective inhibitors of mTOR and PI3K as single agents. To
facilitate the comparison of treatment responses, we ﬁrst
established subcutaneously transplanted endometrial tumors
in immunodeﬁcient mice and then subjected tumor-bearing
mice with similar sized tumors to drug treatment. Consistent

with the genetic mouse model, NVP-BEZ235 (35 mg/kg/day)
treatment resulted in dramatic tumor regressions (Fig. 3A).
Surprisingly, mTOR inhibition by RAD001 (7.5 mg/kg/day) also
caused signiﬁcant and persistent tumor regressions, a strong
inhibitory effect comparable to that produced by BEZ235
treatment (Fig. 3A). In contrast, a high dose (125 mg/kg/day)
of the PI3K selective inhibitor GDC-0941 was only able to slow
down the tumor growth, indicating that targeting PI3K activity
alone was not sufﬁcient to shrink these tumors. To examine
PI3K/mTOR signaling changes in response to different treatment modalities, we isolated tumors from drug-treated mice
for 3 days and analyzed tumor lysates by Western blot analysis.
Although GDC-0941 abrogated the phosphorylation of Akt, it
had little effect on mTOR activity as assessed by phospho-S6RP
levels (Fig. 3B). In contrast, both RAD001 and BEZ235 substantially diminished mTOR signaling (Fig. 3B). In line with
previous reports (33, 34), we also found that mTOR inhibition
by RAD001 resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation, albeit
modest, as well as upregulation of ERK signaling. Despite of
these signaling alterations, Pten Lkb1-deﬁcient endometrial
tumors regressed in response to mTOR inhibition (Fig. 3A).
Together, these results suggest that endometrial tumors driven
by concurrent loss of Pten and Lkb1 are highly dependent on

Ectopic expression of LKB1 sensitizes PTEN LKB1deﬁcient endometrial cancer cells to PI3K inhibition
Our ﬁnding that targeting PI3K is not sufﬁcient to inhibit
mTOR activity or block the growth of Pten-deﬁcient endometrial tumor cells lacking Lkb1 suggests that loss of Lkb1 may
contribute to the reduced sensitivity of endometrial cancer
cells to PI3K inhibitors. To this end, we have analyzed a panel of
12 human endometrial cancer cell lines and found that at least
2 of them, HEC108 and ETN-1, are deﬁcient of both PTEN and
LKB1 (Fig. 4A). Because mTOR signaling is a convergent node
of both PI3K-AKT and LKB1-AMPK signaling axes and Pten
Lkb1-deﬁcient endometrial tumors are highly dependent on
mTOR activation in our genetic mouse model, we next determined whether add-back of LKB1 in PTEN LKB1-deﬁcient
endometrial cancer cells affects their response to PI3K inhibition. Although GDC-0941 treatment reduced p-AKT in both
ETN-1 and HEC108 cells regardless of LKB1 expression levels, it
had little effect on mTOR activity in vector-expressing cells
(Fig. 4B). In contrast, GDC-0941 signiﬁcantly reduced phosphorylation of both S6RP and 4EBP1, downstream effectors of
mTOR signaling, in the corresponding cells expressing LKB1
(Fig. 4B and C). Furthermore, we show that, compared with
their respective vector-expressing cells, LKB1-expressing ETN1 and HEC108 cells exhibited a signiﬁcantly reduced proliferation in response to PI3K inhibition by GDC-0941 (Fig. 4D).
Together, these results suggested that the status of LKB1may
alter signaling response to PI3K inhibition in PTEN-deﬁcient
endometrial cancer cells and modulate their sensitivity to PI3K
and mTOR inhibitors.

Discussion
In this study, we developed a genetic mouse model of
advanced endometrial cancer that recapitulates a subset of
human endometrial concurrent low abundance of Pten and
Lkb1 proteins. Concomitant loss of Pten and Lkb1 in mouse
endometrial epithelium leads to rapid development of highgrade endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinomas with
100% tumor penetrance and a short survival. Consistent
with the previous ﬁnding by Contreras and colleagues (20),
we also found that somatic biallelic deletion of Lkb1 in
mouse endometrium led to the development of invasive but
well-differentiated endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma with partial penetrance (Supplementary Fig. S6 and
Table S1). Although somatic biallelic ablation of Pten in
mouse endometrium only induces hyperplastic lesions by 10
months in our study (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S1), a
previous study using the same genetic approach reported
invasive endometrial adenocarcinoma with partial penetrance by 8 months (24). This discrepancy may be because
of differences in the genetic background of the mice and/or
the titer or infection efﬁciency of the adenovirus used in
these 2 studies. As the disease phenotypes seen in mice with
simultaneous loss of Pten and Lkb1 are much more severe

than those in mice with loss of either gene alone in our study
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1), our data reveal that
Pten and Lkb1 have a cooperative effect in suppression of
endometrial tumorigenesis, consistent with clinical data
that concurrent loss of these tumor suppressors is enriched
in high grade of endometrial cancer.
A surprising and potentially meaningful ﬁnding of this study
is that inhibition of mTOR activity by RAD001 as a single agent
was as effective as the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235
in treating advanced endometrial tumors driven by loss of both
Pten and Lkb1, suggesting a critical role of mTOR signaling in
this type of cancer. This is intriguing as inhibition of mTOR can
lead to increased activity of PI3K/AKT as well as increased
MAPK activity (33, 34), which has been suggested to compromise drug efﬁcacy in the treatment of other cancer types.
However, our ﬁnding that mTOR inhibition is effective in
treating advanced endometrial tumors is concordant with the
results from recent clinical trials testing mTOR inhibitors in
endometrial cancer. These studies have reproducibly reported
stable disease in a signiﬁcant number of cases, even for
patients with metastatic or recurrent endometrial cancers
(35, 36).

Although mTOR inhibitors have showed encouraging results
in endometrial cancers, it is worth noting that clinical trials of
mTOR inhibitors had been initiated long before PI3K inhibitors
became available for clinical development. Moreover, given the
fact that genetic alterations in the components of the PI3K
pathway, for example PI3K, PTEN, and PIK3R1 genes, are
common in endometrial cancers (53%, 65%, and 33%, respectively; ref. 11), it has been postulated that these cancers might
have acquired dependence on PI3K activation and thus are
likely to show better response to new agents targeting above
mTOR. Indeed, a signiﬁcant number of clinical trials testing
PI3K and AKT inhibitors as single agents are currently underway for the treatment of endometrial cancers (www.clinical
trial.gov).
Although clinical trial results are awaited to inform whether
PI3K inhibitors have superior efﬁcacy in tumors harboring
PI3K pathway alterations, there is a crucial need for preclinical
studies to identify additional molecular driver events that
modulate tumor responses to PI3K-targeted cancer therapy.
For the ﬁrst time, our work using a well-deﬁned genetic mouse
model has revealed that endometrial tumors harboring PI3K
pathway activation with a perturbed LKB1/AMPK signaling

axis are actually more sensitive to an mTOR inhibitor than a
PI3K inhibitor as single agents. Notably, our data are also in
concordant with a previous work in non–small cell lung
cancer, in which Lkb1 loss was found associated with greater
resistance to PI3K/AKT inhibitor and MEK inhibitors as
single agents (37). Furthermore, using human endometrial
cancer cells that are deﬁcient in PTEN and LKB1, we show
that re-expression of LKB1 in these PTEN-deﬁcient endometrial cancer cells rendered them more susceptible to
growth inhibition by PI3K inhibitors. Thus, LKB1 may act
as a "molecular switch" that modulates the dependency of
PTEN-deﬁcient tumor cells on the PI3K/AKT or mTOR
signaling. Moreover, our study also provides potential translational insights that the status of LKB1 and its signaling axis
may be a useful predictive marker in clinical trials of
selecting appropriate modalities inhibiting the PI3K-AKTmTOR signaling pathway.
