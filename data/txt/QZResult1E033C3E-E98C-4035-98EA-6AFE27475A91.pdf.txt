Abstract
Metformin is a widely prescribed antidiabetic drug associated with a reduced risk of cancer. Many studies
show that metformin inhibits cancer cell viability through the inhibition of mTOR. We recently showed that
antiproliferative action of metformin in prostate cancer cell lines is not mediated by AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK). We identified REDD1 (also known as DDIT4 and RTP801), a negative regulator of mTOR, as a
new molecular target of metformin. We show that metformin increases REDD1 expression in a p53dependent manner. REDD1 invalidation, using siRNA or REDD1/ cells, abrogates metformin inhibition
of mTOR. Importantly, inhibition of REDD1 reverses metformin-induced cell-cycle arrest and significantly
protects from the deleterious effects of metformin on cell transformation. Finally, we show the contribution
of p53 in mediating metformin action in prostate cancer cells. These results highlight the p53/REDD1 axis
as a new molecular target in anticancer therapy in response to metformin treatment. Cancer Res; 71(13);

Introduction
Metformin, a widely used antidiabetic drug, seems to
reduce the incidence of cancer in diabetic patients (1) and
inhibit cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in animal
models (2–4). Metformin provokes cell-cycle arrest in G0–G1
but does not induce apoptosis or autophagy in prostate cancer
cells (3). At the molecular level, metformin regulates the AMPactivated protein kinase (AMPK)/mTOR pathway, as it activates AMPK (5) and consequently inhibits the mTOR pathway
via tuberous sclerosis 2 protein (TSC2). mTOR upregulates
energy-consuming cellular processes and controls cell growth.
Because AMPK activation inhibits energy-consuming pathways and protein synthesis (6), metformin could inhibit cell
proliferation through AMPK. In agreement, AMPK inhibition
reverses the antiproliferative effects of metformin in breast
and ovarian cancer cells (7, 8). In contrast, we showed that
downregulation of AMPK did not affect metformin action on
prostate cancer cell growth and mTOR inhibition (3), suggesting a role for an alternative pathway.

REDD1 (RTP801/Dig2/DDIT4) was identified as a hypoxiainducible factor 1 (HIF-1) target gene involved in the regulation of cell survival (9). REDD1 is also regulated in response to
DNA damage, nutrient depletion, glucocorticoid, and insulin
(10, 11). A great deal of evidence link REDD1 to tumor
suppression. First, invalidation of REDD1 potentiates cell
proliferation and anchorage-independent growth under
hypoxia and REDD1 is downregulated in some human cancers
(12). Second, REDD1 is a negative regulator of mTOR (13) and
is defined as a key metabolic regulator suppressing tumorigenesis through effects on mTOR activity and mitochondria
(14). Finally, REDD1 is implicated in apoptosis (9). These
observations led us to study its possible implication in metformin action. We report that REDD1 expression is increased
by metformin treatment and can mediate metformin-induced
mTOR inhibition. We show that REDD1 is regulated by p53
and is required for metformin effects on cell-cycle arrest. Our
study highlights the p53/REDD1 axis as a novel molecular
target of metformin.

REDD1 Mediates Metformin Antiproliferative Effects

In vitro transformation assay
LNCaP cells were transfected with siControl (siCT) or
siREDD1 as above, and the soft agar assay was conducted
as recommended by the manufacturer using the Fluorometric
CytoSelect Cell Transformation Assay (Cell Biolabs). Photographs were acquired with a Zeiss microscope.

10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin, and
2 mmol/L glutamine.
Cell transfection
LNCaP cells were transfected with siRNA targeting REDD1,
p53, a1 and a2 AMPK, TSC2, or a control siRNA (Ambion)
using Lipofectamine RNAi max (Invitrogen). Metformin
(Sigma) was added 48 hours after transfection. DU145 cells
were transfected with Flag-REDD1 plasmid using Lipofectamine 2000.

Results and Discussion
Metformin increases REDD1 expression in a
p53-dependent manner
Effects of metformin on mTOR and cell growth are not
mediated by AMPK in prostate cancer cells (3). Because of its
role in mTOR regulation, we asked whether REDD1 could
mediate metformin effects. REDD1 expression markedly
increased from 4 to 24 hours after metformin treatment in
LNCaP cells and REDD1 mRNA levels increased after 4 hours
(Fig. 1B). A similar effect of metformin occurred in breast
(MCF7) and lung cancer (A549) cells (Fig. 1C).
Because REDD1 is a direct p53 transcriptional target (10),
we asked whether p53 regulates REDD1 expression upon
metformin treatment. LNCaP cells harbor wild-type (WT)
p53, whereas DU145 and PC3 cells are p53 mutated and null,
respectively. Whereas REDD1 expression increased in LNCaP
cells, it remained unchanged in cells lacking a functional p53
(Fig. 2A). In LNCaP cells, metformin slightly increased AMPK
phosphorylation, whereas it induced a stronger activation in
DU145 and PC3 cells. Conversely, it strongly decreased
the phosphorylation of S6 ribosomal protein in LNCaP
cells and only moderately in DU145 and PC3 cells (Fig. 2A).
In agreement, REDD1 did not increase anymore in response
to metformin following p53 invalidation using siRNA in

Cell analysis
Cell extracts were prepared using lysis buffer (3). Immunoblotting was carried out with antibodies against REDD1
(ProteinTech); Thr172P-AMPK, Phospho-S6 ribosomal protein,
S6 ribosomal protein, AMPK, and TSC2 (Cell Signalling technology); p53 and HSP90 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); cyclin D1
(BD Bioscience); and a tubulin (Sigma). Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry (3).
Real-time quantitative PCR
The relative amount of REDD1 mRNA was quantified by
real-time quantitative PCR using ABI Prism 7000 (Applied
Biosystems; ref. 11). The primer sequences are available upon
request.
Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assay
Cells were incubated for 24 hours in medium containing
10% FBS and then treated in the presence or absence of
metformin (5 or 10 mmol/L) for 24 hours before bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation assay (3).

LNCaP cells (Fig. 2B). Therefore, REDD1 appears as a p53mediated molecular target of metformin. Similarly, REDD1 is a
p53 target upon DNA damage but is regulated independently
of p53 in response to alkylating agents (10). We have shown
that HIF-1 controls REDD1 expression in response to insulin
and hypoxia in adipocytes (11). However, HIF does not appear
to be implicated in metformin-induced REDD1 expression, as
HIF-1 expression was not affected in LNCaP cells (data not
shown).
We then determined whether p53 is implicated in metformin antiproliferative action in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig.
2C, metformin decreased BrdUrd incorporation by 45% in cells
transfected with a control siRNA. Transfection with a p53
siRNA partially prevented the inhibitory effect of metformin
with a 20% decrease. Similarly, metformin was not effective in
p53/ MEFs (Supplementary Fig. S1). BrdUrd incorporation
was then compared in PC3, DU145, and LNCaP cells. Metformin was significantly more powerful to inhibit cell prolifera-

tion in LNCaP cells (52% decrease) than in DU145 (26%) and
PC3 (22%), two p53-deficient cell lines (Fig. 2D). We highlight
here the important role of p53 in the antiproliferative effect of
metformin in prostate cancer cells.
Our results are at variance with those from Buzzai and
colleagues, who have shown that metformin selectively impairs
the growth of HCT116 colon cancer cells, which are deficient
for p53 (4). This discrepancy may depend on cancer cell types;
indeed, metformin induces autophagy in a p53-dependent
manner in colon cancer cells (4), whereas it inhibits 2-deoxyglucose–induced autophagy in prostate cancer cells (15).
Finally, our observation shows that the p53 status may influence the efficiency of metformin in cancer therapy.

downregulated, using siRNA, S6 phosphorylation was significantly less decreased by metformin treatment than in
control cells (siCT), whereas the phosphorylation of AMPK
was not affected (Fig. 3A). In agreement, metformin did not
affect S6 phosphorylation in REDD1/ MEFs compared with
REDD1þ/þ MEFs (Fig. 3B). Whatever the status of REDD1,
metformin activated AMPK. These data show that REDD1
negatively regulates mTOR activity in prostate cancer cells
and show for the first time that metformin inhibits mTOR
via REDD1.
To reinforce the role of REDD1, we overexpressed REDD1 in
DU145 cells, which harbor a nonfunctional p53. We observed a
stronger inhibition of S6 phosphorylation in cells overexpressing REDD1 and treated with metformin compared with
control conditions (Fig. 3C). Similarly, the re-expression of
REDD1 in REDD1/ cells restored the metformin-induced
inhibition of mTOR (Supplementary Fig. S2). Altogether, these
results show that REDD1 potentiates the inhibitory effect of

www.aacrjournals.org

metformin on mTOR. The TSC2 negatively regulates mTOR
when it is phosphorylated on T1227 and S1345 by AMPK (16). To
determine its role in response to metformin, we used TSC2
siRNA. Following TSC2 invalidation, metformin no longer
inhibited S6 phosphorylation (Fig. 3D).
Our results are in accordance with studies showing that
REDD1 regulates mTOR in response to hypoxia, 2-deoxyglucose, and nutrient depletion (13). It is noteworthy that the
downregulation of S6 phosphorylation is less important in
DU145 and PC3 than in LNCaP cells (Fig. 2A), and overexpression of REDD1 in DU145 cells potentiates the effect
of metformin on mTOR. These results suggest that REDD1
plays an important role in mTOR inhibition. They also show
that mTOR inhibition by metformin is mediated by TSC2 and
is not dependent on REDD1 in p53-deficient cells. Because the
effects of metformin on mTOR were not mediated by AMPK in
prostate cancer cells (3), REDD1 may represent one alternative
route that downregulates mTOR.

REDD1 Mediates Metformin Antiproliferative Effects

Similarly, acadesine (AICAR or aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide), another activator of AMPK, downregulates mTOR independently of AMPK in chronic myelogenous
leukemia cells (17). In contrast, Schneider and colleagues
reported that AMPK regulates REDD1, which inhibits mTOR
in response to energy stress induced by prolonged hypoxia.
However, they also observed an early AMPK-independent
increase of REDD1 in response to hypoxia and suggested that
REDD1 regulation can be AMPK dependent or independent
depending on the duration and the nature of the stress (18). For
example, AMPK starts to be activated 18 hours after hypoxia in
HNSCC, whereas it is transiently activated 4 hours after metformin in LNCaP cells (Fig. 1A). We suggest that the discrepancy observed with the study conducted by Schneider and
colleagues may be related to the intensity, the duration, and the
nature of the stress. It was recently reported that metformin
can act independently of AMPK to downregulate mTOR and,
instead, signals through Rag GTPase (19). Whether or not
REDD1 and this GTPase interact remains to be determined.
REDD1 regulates metformin antiproliferative effect and
cyclin D1 decrease independently of AMPK
To determine whether REDD1 is implicated in metformininduced inhibition of cell viability, LNCaP cells were transfected with REDD1 siRNA and treated with metformin.
BrdUrd incorporation was affected by only 18% in cells
transfected with REDD1 siRNA compared with 76% in cells
transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 4A) in the presence of
5 mmol/L metformin. In parallel, the inhibition of AMPK
had a minor impact on metformin effects with a reduction
of BrdUrd incorporation of 60% and 80% compared with
76% and 82% with control siRNA in the presence of 5 and
10 mmol/L of metformin, respectively (Fig. 4A). These results
show that REDD1 but not AMPK mediates the antiproliferative effects of metformin in LNCaP cells. Metformin-induced
cell-cycle arrest and cyclin D1 decrease are not dependent on
AMPK in LNCaP cells (3). To determine the implication of
REDD1 in this effect, we analyzed cyclin D1 expression and cell
cycle in cells transfected with siREDD1. Cyclin D1 was no
longer decreased, and S6 phosphorylation was significantly
less affected after metformin treatment compared with control siRNA conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore,
the cell cycle was not blocked in G0–G1 in LNCaP cells treated

with metformin and transfected with REDD1 siRNA (Fig. 4B).
To search for a biological consequence of these observations,
we conducted an in vitro transformation assay in LNCaP cells
treated with increasing concentrations of metformin and
transfected or not with REDD1 siRNA. Metformin inhibited
growth in soft agar in a dose-dependent manner, an inhibition
which was significantly less important in cells invalidated for
REDD1 (Fig. 4C). Our observations show that REDD1 is a
mediator of metformin-induced cell-cycle arrest in prostate
cancer cells and is one of the components of a critical pathway
for human tumor suppression (12, 13). Indeed, we show for the
first time that metformin upregulates REDD1, and that REDD1
participates to its anticancerous effect. We and others showed
that metformin alters mitochondrial metabolism (4, 15) and
REDD1 regulates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production in MEFs (14). Although metformin reduces ROS in
normal endothelial cells (20), it did not affect ROS production
in prostate cancer cells (data not shown), suggesting that
metformin-induced REDD1 expression does not regulate ROS
formation in these cells. However, whether or not REDD1
could participate in the other observed effects of metformin
on cancer cell metabolism (i.e., increased glycolysis and
inhibition of complex I) remains to be elucidated. In summary,
elucidating the mechanism by which metformin inhibits
mTOR could be beneficial to the treatment of cancer and
other human pathologies.
