Abstract
Sustained autophagy contributes to the metabolic adaptation of cancer cells to
hypoxic and acidic microenvironments. Since cells in such environments are resistant
to conventional cytotoxic drugs, inhibition of autophagy represents a promising
therapeutic strategy in clinical oncology. We previously reported that the efficacy
of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an autophagy inhibitor under clinical investigation is
strongly impaired in acidic tumor environments, due to poor uptake of the drug, a
phenomenon widely associated with drug resistance towards many weak bases. In
this study we identified salinomycin (SAL) as a potent inhibitor of autophagy and
cytotoxic agent effective on several cancer cell lines under conditions of transient
and chronic acidosis. Since SAL has been reported to specifically target cancer-stem
cells (CSC), we used an established model of breast CSC and CSC derived from breast
cancer patients to examine whether this specificity may be associated with autophagy
inhibition. We indeed found that CSC-like cells are more sensitive to autophagy
inhibition compared to cells not expressing CSC markers. We also report that the
ability of SAL to inhibit mammosphere formation from CSC-like cells was dramatically
enhanced in acidic conditions. We propose that the development and use of clinically
suitable SAL derivatives may result in improved autophagy inhibition in cancer cells
and CSC in the acidic tumor microenvironment and lead to clinical benefits.

Introduction

[5] and defective tissue perfusion coupled with high
metabolic rates contribute to extracellular acidosis in
the tumor microenvironment [6, 7]. It has been shown in
different animal models that the tumor extracellular pH
(pHe) ranges between 5.9 and 7.2 [8-10], with average
tumor pHe often reported ~6.5 [11-13]. Tumor acidosis
represents an important selective force affecting cancer
progression and therapeutic resistance [1, 14-18]. Indeed,
efforts and strategies to counteract tumor acidosis have
shown promising results in different preclinical models
[3, 13, 18-20].

Malignant cells develop under the selective pressure
of metabolic stress conditions including chronic and
intermittent hypoxia and limited nutrients availability
[1-3]. Metabolic adaptation to such environment allows
rapid and continuous growth of cancer cells, leading to
developing of abnormal blood vessels, which arrange
irregularly and are structurally heterogeneous [4]. The
vascular endothelium in tumors is defective and leaky

and tumorigenicity [41, 42] and that SAL can inhibit
autophagy and lysosomal proteolytic activity in both
breast CSC and cancer cells [43]. SAL has been described
as a potassium ionophore inhibiting Wnt signaling and
interfering with the proton gradient within lysosomes [44],
although no effect on lysosomal pH have been reported in
SAL-treated breast cancer cells [43].
In this study we analysed the pH-dependent
cytotoxic and autophagy inhibiting activities of SAL
towards cancer cell lines and CSC. We found that SAL is a
potent inhibitor of the autophagic flux and cytotoxic agent
showing increased efficacy towards cancer cells under low
pH conditions.

Macroautophagy (autophagy) is an evolutionary
conserved process that contributes to cellular homeostasis
by degrading damaged or redundant organelles, and
misfolded proteins [21]. The process begins with the
formation of a double membrane structure, which engulfs
parts of the cytoplasm creating a double membrane
vesicle, which fuses with lysosome (autolysosome).
Lysosomal enzymes active in the acidic environment of
autolysosomes degrade the sequestered cargo and provide
hydrocarbons, fatty acids, amino acids and nucleotides
to cells. Autophagy has a context-dependent role in
initiation, development and progression of cancer [22,
23]. Autophagy suppresses malignant transformation
by different mechanisms such as protection from
genomic instability through elimination of dysfunctional
mitochondria and decreased reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production, degradation of onco-proteins,
induction of senescence and cell death following oncogene
activation, anti-inflammatory function and helping the
immune system to eliminate the malignant cells [24].
After establishment of a neoplastic lesion, autophagy
is believed to promote and sustain tumorigenesis and
to mediate resistance to different forms of anticancer
therapy [25]. In fact, proficient autophagy contributes
to metabolic reprogramming and adaptation to different
metabolic stresses, including hypoxia, acidosis and
nutrient deprivation. About seventy clinical trials are
registered in clinicaltrials.gov testing the use of HCQ or
chloroquine (CQ) as autophagy inhibitors in combination
anticancer therapies [26] but the use of CQ derivatives
for this purpose may require further investigation. In fact,
results from the first phase I/II trials support autophagy
inhibition as a promising therapeutic strategy but also
indicate limitation in the efficacy of HCQ to inhibit
autophagy at the tumor site [27-32], underlining the need
to identify better and more specific autophagy inhibitors
[33]. Recently, others and we reported that autophagy
contributes to the survival and adaptation of cancer cells
to an acidic environment [34, 35]. However, CQ and HCQ
fail to inhibit autophagy in acidic conditions because of a
reduction in cellular uptake of the drugs [36]. Interestingly,
the new CQ-derivative Lys-01, which displays lower pKa
values, has a better activity both as cytotoxic agent and
autophagy inhibitor in acidic conditions [36, 37].
CSC represent a subpopulation of cells with tumor
initiating ability and they are believed to contribute
to resistance to chemotherapy, metastatic spread and
disease relapse [38]. It has also been suggested that tumor
development is characterized by a dynamic transition
between CSC and differentiated tumor cells and that both
these subpopulations should be considered as target for
therapy [39]. Gupta et al. reported that SAL, a polyether
antibiotic widely used in veterinary medicine is a potent
agent able to selectively target breast CSC and to inhibit
mammary tumor growth in vivo [40]. It has been reported
that autophagy promotes maintenance of breast CSC

Results
Salinomycin is a potent autophagy inhibitor in
acidic conditions
We recently showed that the clinically used
autophagy inhibitors CQ and HCQ are not effective in
blocking autophagy in the acidic environment of human
tumors [36]. This effect was associated with a complete
lack of cytotoxicity in acidic conditions in several cancer
cell lines. In search of new autophagy inhibitors active
also in acidic conditions we focused on SAL, an acidic
ionophore compound used as anticoccidiosis in veterinary
medicine. SAL was reported to induce cell death via
autophagy upregulation in some experimental models
[45, 46]. However, it was recently reported that 2 μM SAL
inhibits the autophagic flux in breast and hepatocellular
carcinomas [43, 47]. In order to establish the activity
of SAL on autophagic flux, we started our investigation
by using HOS cells stably transfected with a GFP-LC3
vector, which allows the analysis of the autophagic flux
by flow cytometry by monitoring the accumulation of
GFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes in the presence of
lysosomal inhibitors [48]. BafA1 acts as inhibitor of
the V-ATPase and raises lysosomal pH, thus inhibiting
autolysosomes formation and leading to accumulation
of GFP-LC3-positive autophagosomes. The autophagic
flux here represents the ratio of GFP-LC3 fluorescence
between presence and absence of saturating concentration
of Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1). First, we observed that
HOS-GFP-LC3 cells treated with 2 μM SAL for 6 hours
accumulate a large number of intracellular vacuoles,
with cells cultured at pH 6.8 showing an increased
vacuolization with respect to cells kept at pH 7.4 (Figure
1A). As expected, autophagosomes-associated LC3-GFP
fluorescence was increased in control cells treated with
BafA1 at both pH conditions, indicating the presence
of proficient autophagy in both pH conditions (Figure
1B), with autophagic flux being 2.2±0.23 and 2.2±0.36,
respectively at pH 7.4 and 6.8. A significant increase in

GFP-LC3 fluorescence was observed also in cells treated
only with SAL in both pH conditions. The combined
treatment with BafA1 showed only a minor increase in
cells at pH 7.4, indicating that SAL reduces the autophagic
flux without blocking it (1.5±0.1). Conversely, in cells
kept at pH 6.8 and treated with SAL the GFP-LC3 signal
intensity was similar in presence or absence of BafA1,
suggesting that in HOS cells in acidic conditions SAL
totally blocks the autophagic flux (1±0.1, Figure 1B). To
further test the dose-dependent effects of SAL in these
cells we used high-content fluorescence microscopy
to quantify the number of GFP-LC3-positive vesicles
in cells treated with different doses of SAL in absence
or presence of BafA1. The data show that SAL induces
a dose-dependent accumulation of GFP-LC3-positive
vesicles (Figure 1C-1D) and that at 1-2 μM SAL the
number of GFP-LC3-positive vesicles in BafA1 treated
and untreated cells is similar, thus suggesting that SAL
inhibits autophagic flux (Figure 1E).
In order to properly demonstrate the pH-dependent
activity of SAL, we extended our analysis to different
cell lines representing different tumor hystotypes and
in conditions of both transient and chronic acidosis.
First, we used HCT116 (colon carcinoma) and Me30966
(melanoma) cell lines from which we developed sublines chronically adapted to grow at pH 6.8 [36]. As
indicated above, BafA1 as a lysosomal inhibitor blocks the
degradation and turnover of LC3-II and other substrates
such as SQSTM1. The autophagic flux was then defined as
the ratio between the normalised LC3-II levels in presence
and absence of BafA1 at saturating concentrations (100
nM) (LC3-II AF). In these settings, a ratio of 1 indicates
total blockage of autophagic flux. As observed in the
HOS-GFP-LC3 cells, SAL induced a dose-dependent
inhibition of the turnover of both LC3-II and SQSTM1
in all cell lines tested, with best activity detected at 2 μM
(Figure S1A-B). As shown in Figure 2A and 2C, SAL
treatment induced a strong time-dependent increase in
LC3-II expression in both parental and pH 6.8-adapted
HCT116 and Me30966 cells. In all cell lines, autophagic
flux was strongly inhibited already after 4 hours treatment.
Despite some variability likely dependent on different
substrate-specific kinetics, the turnover of both LC3-II
and to a lesser degree SQSTM1 was reduced in all cell
lines independently of the pH culture conditions (Figure
2B and 2D).
The data shown so far suggest that SAL efficiently
inhibits the autophagic flux in cancer cells also at pH
6.8. However, tumor tissues may be characterised by
regions with even lower pH and the average pH in tumors
is reported to be around 6.5 [10, 12, 16, 49]. We have
reported that CQ failed to inhibit autophagy at pH 6.8
while the CQ dimer Lys-01 had still a detectable activity
at pH 6.8. However, when tested at pH 6.5, Lys-01 did
not induce LC3-II increase in HCT116 cells, suggesting
that its activity is also inhibited at very acidic conditions
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

(Figure S1C). Thus, we tested the activity of SAL on the
autophagic flux in cells after exposing them to medium
buffered at pH as low as 6.5. We exposed HCT116 cells to
media buffered at different pH overnight and added 2 μM
SAL for 8 hours, with BafA1 added during the last 2 hours
incubation. We observed that SAL maintained a strong
autophagy blocking activity even at pH 6.5 as shown by
LC3-II and SQSTM1 expression (Figure 3A) and a similar
observation was made using Me30966 cells cultured at pH
6.5 (Figure S1D).

The activity of SAL is detectable in the acidic core
of multicellular spheroids
To gain further insight into the capacity of SAL
to block autophagy in a more complex environment we
took advantage of the multicellular spheroid (MCS)
culture system, where cells grow in a 3D structure with
a central core characterised by acidic pH in the range
6.6-6.8 [50]. MCS from HCT116 cells were treated with
CQ, Lys-01 and SAL and the accumulation of LC3-II was
analysed. First, we observed by Western Blot (WB) that
SAL induced a dose-dependent accumulation of LC3-II
and SQSTM1 after 24 hours treatment (Figure 3B). The
accumulation of LC3-II was even higher in MCS treated
with Lys-01 (50 μM), BafA1 (50 nM) and CQ (50 μM).
Compounds blocking the autophagic turnover of
LC3-II are expected to induce an increase in total LC3
positivity in tissues due to lack of LC3-II degradation.
Interestingly, when analyzing the distribution pattern
of LC3 signal intensity in relation to MCS areas by
immunohistochemistry (IHC), we observed that MCS
treated with CQ and Lys-01 showed a strong LC3
signal localised in the outer peripheral layer but almost
completely absent in the MCS core, suggesting a failure
to block autophagy in the acidic/hypoxic core of the MCS
(Figure 3C). Conversely, low concentrations of SAL
(2 μM) were able to increase LC3 intensity throughout
the whole MCS area, similarly to the effects observed
after treatment with BafA1 (Figure 3C). A quantitative
image analysis of LC3 positive pixels normalised to
the total number of pixels in each area showed that CQ
and Lys-01 mostly induced accumulation of LC3 in the
peripheral layer of MCS while BafA1 and SAL induced a
significantly higher increase in LC3 positive pixels both in
the peripheral region and in the core region of MCS with
respect to CQ and Lys-01 (Figure 3C-3D).
In line with a more effective autophagy blocking
activity in this 3D culture model, SAL showed a much
stronger cytotoxic effect on MCS as compared to CQ
and Lys-01 as shown by viability assay (Figure 3E).
Interestingly, clonogenic cell survival assay showed that
while 12 μM CQ or Lys-01 still allowed about 80% of
treated cells to form colonies, the same concentration of
SAL completely inhibited the capacity of cells to survive

In conclusion, these data suggest that very low SAL
concentrations are able to inhibit the autophagic flux in
HMLER cells cultured at acidic pH.

SAL blocks the autophagic flux in cancer stem
cells

Acidosis enhances the cytotoxicity of salinomycin
against cancer cells

SAL was identified as a breast CSC-specific
cytotoxic agent using a model of immortalised and
transformed breast carcinoma cells (HMLER) carrying
CSC properties [40]. Using the same model, Yue and
colleagues reported that SAL selectively targets breast
CSC through inhibition of autophagy [43]. HMLER cells
are composed of two different cell populations differing
in their CSC properties and in CD24 expression (Figure
S2A) [51]. CD44+/CD24+ cells have an epithelial
phenotype and no ability to make mammospheres while
CD44+/CD24low cells have properties of CSC, including
capacity to form mammospheres. First, we observed also
in these cells that 2 μM SAL blocks the autophagic flux
both at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8 as measured by LC3-II in the
presence of BafA1 (Figure S2C).
In order to confirm the data on autophagic flux
obtained by WB, we transfected HMLER CD24+ and
CD24low cells with an LC3 tandem probe in which
LC3 is tagged to GFP and RFP. Because the acidic pH
of lysosomes quenches the green fluorescence of GFP,
this probe helps to identify and count autophagosomes
(GFP+RFP+ yellow dots) and autolysosomes (GFPRFP+ red dots). Cells were exposed overnight to medium
buffered at pH 7.4 or 6.8 and treated with SAL (2 μM)
or starved with Earle´s Balanced Salt Solution (EBSS)
for 6 hours (Figure 4A). As expected, EBSS-treated cells
showed an increased number of red dots in all conditions
examined, indicating that starvation-induced autophagy
occurs in all cells (Figure 4B). Treatment with SAL
induced the accumulation of yellow dots in all conditions
tested as compared to control and such effect was
significantly greater in both cell lines cultured at acidic
pH (Figure 4B).
To further investigate the sensitivity of HMLER
cells to autophagy inhibition we tested the activity of
different SAL concentrations at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8. First,
we observed that the basal autophagic turnover of LC3II seems to be higher in CD24+ cells as compared to
CD24low cells (Figure 5A). The analysis of the autophagic
flux based on LC3-II turnover showed that SAL reduced
the autophagic flux in a dose-dependent manner in both
cell lines and at both pH 7.4 and pH 6.8 (Figure 5A-5C).
Quantification of the autophagic flux calculated based on
BafA1-induced accumulation of SQSTM1 supported the

The inability of CQ to block autophagy in
acidic conditions is associated with a complete lack
of cytotoxicity in cancer cells under acidic conditions.
Therefore, we performed cytotoxic assays to test whether
low pH affected the cytotoxic effects of SAL. We used
parental HCT116 and Me30966 cells cultured at pH 7.4
and their low pH-adapted sublines cultured at pH 6.8
(HCT116pH7.4 and HCT116pH6.8) and exposed to increasing
SAL concentrations for 48 hours. Microscopic observation
of cells indicated a massive vacuolization at pH 6.8
already 6 hours after treatment with SAL, as shown for
Me30966 cells in Figure 6A. SAL showed a dramatic and
significantly increased cytotoxicity in low pH-adapted
cells (Figure 6B-6C), with a 10-fold difference in IC50
values (Table 1). These effects were not dependent on the
phenotype of acid-adapted cells since parental HCT116
and Me30966 cells exposed to acidic medium only for the
duration of the treatment were equally sensitive as their
acid-adapted sublines (Figure 6D-6E), suggesting that
the increased SAL cytotoxicity in acidic conditions are
likely dependent only on the pH of the culture medium.
Conversely, the cytotoxic effects of SAL in acid-adapted
cells cultured at pH 7.4 were comparable to those observed
for the parental cell lines (Figure 6D-6E).
To analyse the effects of SAL on clonogenic cell
survival we used HCT116pH7.4 and HCT116pH6.8 cells and
exposed them to different SAL concentrations for 48
hours, followed by culturing cells in drug-free medium for
6 days. Again, the inhibiting effect of SAL on clonogenic
growth was dramatically increased in cells cultured
at acidic pH (Figure 6F). In addition, we performed
clonogenic survival assay on parental HCT116 cells
cultured at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8 in the presence of SAL for
8 hours and then kept in drug-free medium for 6 days. The
data indicate that even short exposure to SAL in acidic
conditions is effective in reducing clonogenic cell survival
while very mild effects were observed in cells treated at
pH 7.4 (Figure 6G).

Acidic conditions improve the ability of SAL to
kill cancer stem cells

the CSC property of mammospheres formation. First, we
cultured adherent CD24low cells at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8
in presence of increasing concentrations of SAL for 48
hours and investigated the sphere-forming ability of viable
single cells after treatment. As shown in Figure 7C, at
physiological pH 7.4 culture conditions cells treated with
SAL formed significantly less mammospheres as compared
to untreated cells (P < 0.05). However, this effect was
dramatically increased in cells that were treated with
SAL under acidic conditions, with < 10% mammospheres
formed with SAL 2 μM at pH 6.8 (P < 0.05, Figure 7C).
In line with this observation, we found that the effects of
SAL on reducing the size of mammospheres were also
significantly enhanced in acidic conditions (Figure 7D).
Similar results were obtained when single cell suspension
of CD24low cells were allowed to form mammospheres
in the presence or absence of SAL for 7 days (Figure
S3A-B).

SAL was shown to be more selective towards breast
CSC [40] and it is currently investigated as a promising
compound to develop in anti-CSC therapy [52]. We
showed that autophagy inhibition by SAL is increased
at acidic conditions. We were therefore interested in
investigating the effects of pH on cytotoxic activity of SAL
in HMLER CD24+ and CD24low cells at pH 7.4 and 6.8.
First, we confirmed also in these cells that the cytotoxic
activity of CQ is totally inhibited by even mild acidosis
(Figure S2B). Thus, we tested the sensitivity of these cells
to the dimeric CQ derivative Lys-01 and we observed that
CD24low cells are more sensitive to Lys-01 with respect
to CD24+ cells (IC50 13.5 ± 1.7 vs 30.3 ± 9 μM, P = 0.07),
indicating that breast CSC are more sensitive to autophagy
inhibition (Figure 7A). As expected, the CD24low cells
are more sensitive to SAL as compared to CD24+ cells in
standard culture conditions at pH 7.4 (P < 0.05), in line
with their increased susceptibility to autophagy inhibition
(Figure 7B and Table 2). Interestingly, the cytotoxic
effects of SAL on both cell lines were dramatically
amplified in acidic culture conditions (Figure 7B and
Table 2), as already observed for HCT116 and Me30966
cells. Importantly, the IC50 of SAL for CD24low cells was
10-fold lower than that for CD24+ cells, suggesting an
even more selective effect of SAL on these cells at acidic
conditions (P < 0.05, Table 2). For example, massive
vacuolization was observed in CD24low cells exposed to
SAL for only 5 hours and cultured at acidic pH while this
phenomenon was not seen at pH 7.4 (Figure S2D).

Acidic conditions improve the ability of SAL to
inhibit mammosphere formation from breast
cancer tissue derived stem cells
In order to test the potential relevance of these
findings in clinical settings we have analysed the
activity of SAL on patient derived breast CSC. Clinical
characteristics of tumor patients are provided in Table
3. Briefly, tumor cells were isolated from patientderived breast cancer tissues and cultured in selective
medium as described in Materials and Methods in order
to obtain mammospheres (see Figure S3C as example).
Mammospheres were then trypsinized and single cells
suspensions were cultured at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8 in
absence or presence of three SAL concentrations. Newly
formed mammospheres were counted after 10 days in
culture. First, we could observe that different pH culture
conditions did not significantly affect the absolute number
of mammospheres formed in untreated cultures (23 ± 8

off-target effects of CQ reported recently [55, 56]. We
showed that tumor acidosis is one of the factors that
may negatively affect the efficacy of CQ in vivo [36].
In fact, CQ shows no cytotoxicity and no autophagy
inhibition on cancer cells cultured in acidic conditions
and in hypoxic tumor regions in a human colon carcinoma
xenograft. Such limitations may possibly be overcome
by the development of new CQ-derivatives optimized for
clinical applications [25, 37]. This scenario prompted us
to search for more effective autophagy inhibitors able to
target cancer cells during tumor acidosis. The ionophore
salinomycin was reported as a compound selectively
targeting breast cancer stem cell [40]. The effects of SAL
on cancer stem cells have been also reported for other
cancer types including glioma and many carcinomas
[52, 57-59]. It has been shown that SAL interferes with
the maintenance of breast CSC by acting as inhibitor
of autophagy and of lysosomal proteolytic function
[43]. Here we confirm that SAL at doses 0.2-2 μM
potently inhibits the autophagic flux in different tumor
cells lines, including osteosarcoma, melanoma, colon
carcinoma and breast carcinoma. Importantly, unlike CQ
and its derivatives whose activity is to different degrees
counteracted by acidosis, the ability of SAL to inhibit
autophagic flux is potently increased in conditions of both
transient and chronic acidosis. In line with the increased
activity as autophagy inhibitor at acidic pH, we found
that the cytotoxic activity of SAL was augmented by 5-10
fold in conditions of acidosis when tested on melanoma,
colon and breast carcinoma cell lines, with SAL IC50 being
in the range 100-500 nM in cells cultured at pH 6.8. We
observed that the cytotoxic activity of SAL in terms of
IC50 was similar in cancer cell lines transiently exposed to
acidosis and in the same cell lines chronically adapted to
acidosis, suggesting that SAL sensitivity may be dictated
by medium pH and not by intrinsic properties of the cell
lines. Such activity may be related to the pharmacological
properties of SAL, which is a weakly acidic, lipophilic
compound with a reported pKa of 6.4 due to its carboxylic
group [60]. In fact, mass spectrometry analysis of SAL
showed an increased intracellular accumulation in cells
cultured at pH 6.8 as compared to cells cultured in medium
at the physiological pH. However, whether such increased
accumulation is alone responsible to explain the stronger
activity of SAL in acidic conditions remains to be further
investigated. In fact, SAL has an inhibitory effect on
oxidative phosphorylation and it is generally considered
an inhibitor of mitochondrial function [61, 62], causing
a very fast acidification of the mitochondrial matrix.
Cell survival under acidosis was reported in post-mitotic
cells to be mediated by a homeostatic adaptive response
leading to increased mitochondrial function, including
maximal respiratory capacity [63]. Interestingly, we
observed that acid-adapted HCT116 cells show a higher
maximal respiratory capacity as compared to cells cultured
at physiological pH (Pellegrini et al, unpublished data)

at pH 7.4 vs 17 ± 5 at pH 6.8, P = 0.13). As observed
for mammospheres from HMLER CD24low cells, SAL
inhibited the formation of mammospheres in standard
culture conditions in a dose-dependent manner (Figure
7E). Notably, the ability of SAL to inhibit mammosphere
formation from patients-derived CSC was dramatically
increased in acidic conditions, indicating that SAL has
a strong pH-dependent activity also on freshly derived
patients CSC (Figure 7F).

Salinomycin accumulates at higher concentrations
in cells under acidic conditions
A major reason for the lack of anti-autophagic
activity of CQ in cancer cells cultured in acidic conditions
is the dramatically reduced entry of the drug into cells
because of its chemical properties as a weak base with a
pKa around 8.1 [36, 53]. SAL contains a carboxylic acid
and is a weak acid with a reported experimental pKa of
6.4, which may favor its plasma membrane permeability in
acidic conditions. Since SAL showed an improved ability
to target cancer cells in acidic conditions we applied
UPLC-MS/MS to investigate pH-dependent changes in
intracellular SAL accumulation. These experiments were
run with two concentrations of SAL (2-4 μM) and in
three cell lines (HCT116, HMLER CD24+ and HMLER
CD24low cells). The analysis in all cell lines indicated that
SAL accumulates in a dose-dependent manner and that
the intracellular amount of SAL is significantly higher (up
to 50%) in cells cultured in acidic conditions (Figure 8).
These results suggest that the intracellular accumulation
of SAL may be favored by acidic conditions, which may
contribute to the increased activity of SAL in acidic
conditions.

Discussion
Tumor acidosis represents an important pathogenic
factor in the progression towards malignant disease and it
has been known for many decades to negatively impact
on therapeutic efficacy [20, 54]. Autophagy is also known
as an important protective mechanism against different
forms of anticancer therapies and autophagy inhibition
is recognized as a potential tool to improve efficacy of
chemotherapy [25]. We and others have reported that
melanoma and breast carcinoma cell lines adapt to chronic
acidosis by upregulating autophagy, thus providing a
rationale for targeting autophagy in acidic tumor regions
to prevent malignant progression and improve therapeutic
efficacy [34, 35]. The results of phase I/II clinical trials
using HCQ as autophagy inhibitor in combination
anticancer therapies have indicated potential clinical
benefits for a subset of the treated patients but also poor
efficacy [33]. Confounding factors for the explanation of
these results are the autophagy-independent additional

and it is conceivable to hypothesize that SAL-mediated
inhibition of mitochondrial function may contribute to
increase the sensitivity of cancer cells under acidosis.
Moreover, SAL is a potassium ionophore and very likely
alters potassium gradients. Interestingly, other potassium
ionophores like nigerycin inhibit lysosomal degradation
and autophagic flux [64] and there is growing evidence
that ions modulate autophagy in cancer [65].
Preclinical pharmacokinetic studies on SAL
metabolism performed in mice treated with 5 mg/kg
indicated that the Cmax of plasma SAL concentration was
1.7 μM with a very fast systemic elimination within 5
hours [66]. Interestingly, SAL 5 mg/kg had low systemic
toxicity but induced neurotoxic effects which could
be reduced using mitochondrial Na+/Ca2+ exchanger
inhibitors without affecting the antitumor effects. In line
with this, studies in mice indicated that SAL has reversible
dose-dependent adverse effects on the male reproductive
system [67]. Therefore, the poor water solubility and its
toxicity still represent important limitations for clinical
use of SAL, pointing out that SAL derivatives and/or
nanoparticles are to be developed to reach higher local
concentrations at tumor site [68]. In this context, there is
only one report on the treatment of two cancer patients
with low dose SAL (250 μg/kg) which showed mild but
not long-term side effects [69].
Since SAL has been reported to inhibit CSC in
several cancer models we investigated its activity in a
model of breast CSC. Two sublines derived from the cell
line HMLER and differing in their stem cell properties
have been recently described [51]. We first observed that
the subline HMLER CD24low, carrying CSC properties
has an increased sensitivity to autophagy inhibition
mediated by Lys-01 and SAL with respect to the non-CSC
subline HMLER CD24+, confirming that autophagy plays
a crucial role in maintaining survival and proliferation
of CSC [41, 70, 71]. Interestingly, exposure to acidic
medium increased the sensitivity of CD24+ cells by 5-fold
whereas a 15-fold increase in sensitivity was observed in
CD24low cells. In line with this, SAL was more effective
at inhibiting autophagic flux in CD24low cells and as low
as 200 nM SAL was sufficient to block autophagic flux
in CD24low cells cultured in acidic conditions. CD24low
cells were described to have CSC features among which
the ability to form mammospheres in vitro [51]. We found
that SAL inhibits mammosphere formation from CD24low
cells in standard culture conditions and such inhibition
is greatly amplified during acidosis. This indicates that
cells with stem-like properties are more susceptible to
autophagy inhibition. Moreover it also supports new
findings suggesting that inhibition of lysosomal function
may specifically target CSC in different cancer types [72,
73]. To further investigate the potential clinical relevance
of our observation, we analysed the pH-dependent
effects of SAL on CSC derived from patients with breast
carcinoma. Breast CSC obtained from cancer patients
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

showed a much greater sensitivity to SAL when cultured
in acidic medium.
In conclusion, we identified SAL as a potent
inhibitor of the autophagic flux active under tumor
acidosis on both cancer cells and CSC. The development
of SAL derivatives with lower toxicity for humans will be
fundamental to test its efficacy in clinical settings.

were from Sigma. Recombinant human epidermal growth
factor (EGF) was purchased from Invitrogen (PHG6045).
The Lys-01 was synthetized by OncoTargeting AB
(Sweden) and dissolved in DMSO. Protein assay dye
reagent concentrate (500-0006), protein assay standard
I (5000-0007) and dry milk (170-6404) were from BioRad. The following antibodies were used: LC3B (Cell

HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit (NA934V) and anti-mouse
(NXA931) antibodies, ECL system (RPN2106) and PVDF
membranes (RPN303F) were from GE Healthcare.

Cell culture
Me30966, HCT116 and HOS-GFP-LC3 cell lines
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% FBS and antibiotics. The HOS cell line stably
expressing the GFP-LC3 plasmid (HOS-GFP-LC3) was
a kind gift from Gerry McInerney (MTC, Karolinska
Institute, Stockholm). The cell lines HMLER CD24+
and HMLER CD24low were kindly provided by Dr.
Anne-Pierre Morel (Centre Leon Berard, Lyon, France).
These cells were grown in DMEM-F12 medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, antibiotics, insulin (10 μg/
ml), hydrocortisone (0.5 μg/ml), EGF (10 ng/ml) and
puromycin (0.5 μg/ml). All cells lines were grown at
37°C in presence of 5% CO2. The low pH adapted HCT116 (HCT116pH6.8) and Me30966 (Me30966pH6.8) cell lines
were obtained by growing the parental cells in RPMI-1640
medium buffered at pH 6.8 for three months as previously
described [36]. The different pH in media was buffered by
adding different concentration of NaHCO3 and letting the
media equilibrate overnight in the incubator at 5% CO2.

Actual pH in media was measured before, during and after
each experiment. Cell lines were tested using the LGC
Standards Cell Line Authentication service.

LC3 expression was calculated as number of positive
pixels (including positive and strong positive pixels).
The peripheral area (roughly 10 cellular layers) and the
central area of each MCS, respectively characterising
proliferating/normoxic cells and quiescent/hypoxic cells
[74] were analysed and LC3 expression was normalised
to total area and expressed as percentage.

High-content fluorescence microscopy
HOS-GFP-LC3 cells (7000 cells/well) were plated
into a 96 well plate (Cell carrier, 6005550) and incubated
at 37ºC and 5% CO2 overnight. The medium was removed
at the following day and replaced with medium at pH 7.4
or pH 6.8. SAL was added for 6 h and BafA1 for the last
2 h of the incubation. The medium was removed and the
cells were incubated with 4% paraformaldehyde and 5µg/
ml Hoechst 33342 (Thermo Fischer, H3570) in the dark at
RT for 20 minutes. The paraformaldehyde was removed
and the cells were washed three times using PBS and kept
in PBS during acquisition. Images were captured using an
ImageXpress scanner. The software MetaXpress was used
to analyse the pictures defining GFP-positive dots of 0.58 µm as GFP-LC3-positive vesicles. ImageJ was used to
compose the pictures of the different wavelenghts.

Mammosphere formation
After treatment with SAL for 48 hours, HMLER
CD24low cells were collected and resuspended in DMEM/
F12 medium supplemented with B27 (1:50, Invitrogen,
17504044), 20 ng/ml EGF, 0.4% BSA, 0.5 μg/ml
hydrocortisone, 4 μg/ml insulin, as previously described
[43]. For each treatment group, cells were plated at 1 cell/
well/150 μl in one ultralow attachment 96-wells plate
(Costar, 7007), one full plate per condition. After 5-7 days,
the number and size of mammospheres formed in each
plate were counted and analysed. In some experiments,
HMLER CD24low cells were directly cultured as single
cell suspension in the presence of SAL for 7 days and the
number of mammospheres formed was evaluated.

Multicellular spheroids

Clinical samples

HCT116 cells (10000 cells in 370 μL) were added to
each well of ultra low 96-well plates and the plates were
inverted to allow the cells to sediment for 24 hr. After
flipping the plates, newly formed MCS were allowed to
sediment and were incubated for 5 days before treatment
with compounds. At this stage MCS had a diameter of
about 600 μm.

Fresh biopsies and scrapings from patients with
primary breast cancer (Table 3) were obtained from the
Karolinska Hospital and immediately processed. Research
on the tumor samples was approved by the local biobank
at Karolinska University Hospital and the Regional Ethics
Board in Stockholm, Sweden. Fresh biopsies and/or tumor
cells were directly generated from surgically resected
breast cancers at Karolinska University Hospital as
previously described [75]. Tumor cells were immediately
transferred into the selective medium DMEM/F12GlutaMAX supplied with 10 ng/ml b-FGF, 20 ng/ml
EGF, 5 µg/ml insulin and 0.4% BSA for the initiation
of mammospheres. In general, scrapings were washed
twice in PBS, the final cell pellets were re-suspended in
the selective medium and stable mammospheres can be
observed after 3 days (Figure S3C). Sensitivity to SAL was
tested on single cell suspensions obtained from dissociated
mammospheres and cultured in DMEM-F12 buffered at
pH 7.4 or 6.8 at 1000 viable cells per well in 48-well
plates (Corning Costar, MA) to form mammospheres.
Plates were incubated for 10 days and the number of
newly formed mammospheres was documented.

Immunohistochemistry
For experiments in which MCS were stained for
LC3 expression by immunoistochemistry, MCS were
treated with BafA1 (50 nM), CQ (50 μM), Lys-01 (50 μM)
and SAL (2 μM) for 24 hours before processing samples.
MCS from each treatment group (n = 24) were fixed in
2% buffered formalin, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin
and 10 μm sections were obtained. The sections were
deparaffinized with xylene, rehydrated and microwaved.
Sections were stained with rabbit anti-human LC3B (Cell
Signaling Technology, 2775) and visualized by avidinbiotin-peroxidase complex technique (Vector Laboratories,
Burlingame, CA, USA). Counterstaining was done using
Mayer’s haematoxylin.
The analysis of LC3 expression was performed
by two independent operators using the software Aperio
ImageScope and the algorithm positive pixel count v9,
as described previously [36]. Since the basal level of
LC3 expression in untreated MCS is weak, treatment
with any of the autophagy inhibitors tested will block
turnover of LC3-II and induce increased LC3 expression.

Cell viability assay

HOS-GFP-LC3 cells (100,000 cells) were plated into
20 cm2 dishes. The next day medium was replaced with
medium at pH 7.4 or 6.8 for 24 hours. SAL was added for
6 hours and BafA1 (50 nM) was added during the last 2
hours incubation. Cells were collected by trypsinization
and treated with 0.05% saponin (Biochemika, 47036)
in PBS for 10 minutes at RT. After wash in PBS the
cells were collected and immediately analysed by a
FACSCalibur instrument using Cellquest software (Becton
Dickinson). GFP fluorescence was collected from 10,000
cells/sample.
Analysis of the autophagic flux by Western blot was
done on different cell lines. Experiments with parental cell
lines were performed by plating cells in standard RPMI
buffered at pH 7.4. The next day the medium was replaced
with media buffered at the desired pH (7.4, 6.8 and 6.5).
Low pH-adapted cell lines were plated in medium buffered
at pH 6.8 and let adhere overnight. SAL was added at
specified concentrations for 6 hours and 100 nM BafA1
was added during the last 2 hours incubation. Cells were
then collected for further analysis by flow cytometry or
Western blotting.
Analysis of autophagy in HMLER CD24+ and
CD24low cells was performed using an mRFP-GFP-LC3
reporter. Adherent cells were transfected with the mRFPGFP-LC3 plasmid by using lipofectamine 3000. The next
day, medium was replaced with fresh medium buffered at
the desired pH. After overnight incubation, SAL was added
for 6 hours and EBSS-treated cells were used as controls.
Cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and observed
by laser scanning fluorescence microscopy. Autophagic
flux was determined by quantification of the number of
autophagosomes (yellow dots) and autolysosomes (red
dots) per cell, counting at least 15 cells per condition.

Cells were plated into 96-wells plates and the next
day treated with different concentrations of the specific
compounds (SAL, CQ and Lys-01). Forty-eight hours after
treatment cell viability was evaluated by using the acid
phosphatase assay [76].

Clonogenic assay
HCT116 cell lines were plated as 300 cells/well
in 6-well plates and treated with SAL for 8 or 48 hours,
following culture for 6 days in drug-free media. Colonies
were stained with Giemsa.
Clonogenic cell survival was also assessed on
HCT116 MCS treated for three days with different
compounds. After treatment, the MCS were collected,
washed in PBS and single cell suspension was obtained
after incubation with Accutase (Biolegend, 423201).
Equal volumes of cells for each treatment condition were
plated in triplicate in 6-well plates for 6 days, followed by
staining the colonies with Giemsa. The software ImageJ
was used to perform colony counting.

UPLC-MS/MS
analysis
intracellular content

salinomycin

The intracellular content of SAL was examined
using a method commonly used for assessing drug uptake/
accumulation [77]. In brief, HCT116, HMLER CD24+ and
CD24low cells were plated in 24-wells plates overnight
and the next day medium was replaced with fresh medium
at pH 7.4 and pH 6.8. Immediately after, SAL (2-4 μM)
was added to the cells for 3 hours. After the 3h incubation
cells were washed once with PBS at room temperature
and then acetonitrile was added and let evaporate. The
intracellular accumulation of SAL was quantified by
ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem
mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The compounds
accumulated were extracted with 200 μl acetonitrile/water
(60/40) spiked with 50 nM warfarin as internal standard.
The samples were centrifuged at 2465g and 4°C for 20
minutes. Accumulation of SAL was determined using a
Waters Xevo triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with
electrospray ionization coupled to an Acquity UPLC
system (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Compounds were
separated with a 2 min elution at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/
min in a Waters BEH C18 column, 2.1 x 50 mm (1.7 μm)
at 60°C. Mobile phase consisted of 5% acetonitrile and
0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A), and 0.1% formic
acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The chromatographic run
started at 20% solvent B and increased linearly to 99%
from 0.5 to 1.2 min, followed by a hold until 1.6 min, and
a return to initial conditions at 1.7 min. SAL was detected

Western blotting
Cells were washed with PBS on ice and collected
by scraping in cold PBS. The cell pellet was lysed in
RIPA buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1%
Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate)
in presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The
protein concentration was determined by Biorad Protein
Assay (Biorad Laboratories) and equal amount of proteins
(20 μg) was loaded on pre-casted acrylamide gels (412% SDS-PAGE, NuPage). The proteins were transferred
from the gel to PVDF membrane for 2 hours at 4°C. Red
Ponceau staining of the membranes verified the proper
loading and transfer. Membranes were blocked in 5%
blotting grade dry milk in TBS with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T)
for 1 hour at room temperature and then incubated
with primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA in TBS-T
overnight at 4°C. The next day membranes were washed
and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature with the
appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and the
binding revealed by the ECL system.
