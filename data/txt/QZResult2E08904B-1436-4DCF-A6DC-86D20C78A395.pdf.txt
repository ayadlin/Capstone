Abstract
The selective delivery of bioactive agents to tumors reduces toxicity and enhances the efﬁcacy of anticancer
therapies. In this study, we show that the antibody F8, which recognizes perivascular and stromal EDA-ﬁbronectin
(EDA-Fn), when conjugated to interleukin-2 (F8-IL2) can effectively inhibit the growth of EDA-Fn–expressing
melanomas in combination with paclitaxel. We obtained curative effects with paclitaxel administered before the
immunocytokine. Coadministration of paclitaxel increased the uptake of F8 in xenografted melanomas,
enhancing tumor perfusion and permeability. Paclitaxel also boosted the recruitment of F8-IL2–induced natural
killer (NK) cells to the tumor, suggesting a host response as part of the observed therapeutic beneﬁt. In support of
this likelihood, NK cell depletion impaired the antitumor effect of paclitaxel plus F8-IL2. Importantly, this
combination reduced both the tumor burden and the number of pulmonary metastatic nodules. The combination
did not cause cumulative toxicity. Together, our ﬁndings offer a preclinical proof that by acting on the tumor
stroma paclitaxel potentiates the antitumor activity elicited by a targeted delivery of IL2, thereby supporting the
use of immunochemotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Cancer Res; 72(7); 1814–24. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Melanoma is the most common nonhematopoietic cancer in
young adults, and the incidence of the disease is increasing at
an alarming pace worldwide (1). In a meta-analysis of 42 phase
II cooperative group trials, median survival in metastatic stage
IV melanoma was only 6.2 months, with a mean 1-year overall
survival (OS) rate of 25.5% regardless of treatment regimen (2).
Despite the recent success of targeted therapies against the
BRAF protein—led by vemurafenib (PLX 4032; ref. 3)—metastatic melanoma remains a solid malignancy that deserves
therapeutic options.

In the arena of chemotherapy dacarbazine is considered the
benchmark treatment for advanced melanoma, despite a
response rate of less than 13% to 20% (4). Paclitaxel is a
reasonable second-line therapy that has been evaluated in
numerous trials as monotherapy (5, 6) or as part of a combination with other therapies (7). In metastatic melanoma,
single-agent paclitaxel has antitumor effects comparable with
those reported for dacarbazine and other single-agent chemotherapies, with a response rate between 0% to 33% (6).
Immunotherapy is a well-recognized therapeutic tool for
patients with advanced melanoma. Interleukin-2 (IL2) is a U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent for the
treatment of metastatic melanoma, whereas IFN-a is a therapy
option for adjuvant treatment of patients with resected melanoma. A meta-analysis reviewed 18 studies of chemotherapy
combined with IL2 and IFN-a: although some of these studies
reported durable tumor responses or increased progressionfree survival (PFS), no regimen to date has improved OS (8, 9).
Moreover, these chemoimmunotherapy combinations are generally associated with considerable toxicity.
Very recently ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb),
which blocks cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated antigen 4
(CTLA-4) to potentiate T-cell antitumor response, was shown
to improve OS in patients with previously treated metastatic
melanoma (10). The approval of ipilimumab by FDA has
renewed interest in immunotherapy as a legitimate therapeutic approach for melanoma (11).
The selective delivery of bioactive agents (i.e., cytotoxic
drugs, radionuclides, or immunostimulatory cytokines) to the

Paclitaxel with F8-IL2 Immunocytokine Inhibits Melanoma

tumor site is a promising avenue for the development of novel
anticancer therapies. Vascular and tumor stroma–associated
markers are particularly attractive targets for antibody-based
delivery of therapeutic agents in view of their selective and
accessible expression in solid tumors (12).
Tumor progression is generally accompanied by angiogenesis together with the reorganization of the extracellular
matrix (ECM). In this regard, the de novo synthesis of oncofetal
isoforms of ﬁbronectin (Fn) has been extensively described
during tissue remodeling (13). Fn variants are generated by
alternative splicing of the ED-A, ED-B, and IIICS domains, as
well as by de novo glycosylation. Recently the Fn isoform
containing EDA has been shown to be associated to vascular
and stromal structures in a wide variety of cancer types.
Furthermore, Natali and colleagues described an abundant
expression of EDA-Fn in primary melanomas and their metastases (14). A high-afﬁnity human mAb directed to EDA-Fn, F8,
has been shown to display tumor-targeting selectivity in
biodistribution experiments (15). Moreover we have recently
reported that this antibody fused to human IL2 (F8-IL2)
improves the therapeutic performance of sunitinib, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, in a xenograft model of human kidney
cancer (16).
In this study, we show that human metastatic melanoma
lesions express high levels of perivascular and stromal EDAFn, which is detectable with the recombinant antibody F8,
and that the immunocytokine F8-IL2 administrated in combination with paclitaxel signiﬁcantly inhibits [60%–80%
complete regressions (CR)] the growth of a human xenografted melanoma expressing a high level of EDA-Fn in nude
mice. Furthermore F8-IL2 added to paclitaxel signiﬁcantly
reduced metastatic nodules to the lung of mice bearing
metastatic melanoma. In vivo optical and dynamic contrast
enhanced-MRI (DCE-MRI) and immunohistochemical data
indicate that the ability of paclitaxel to potentiate the
antitumor activity of F8-IL2 is associated with its capability
to modify certain tumor vessel functionalities related to
vascular perfusion and permeability and to promote host
immune reaction. Our ﬁndings endorse the use of chemoimmunotherapy in the treatment of metastatic melanoma and
suggest that paclitaxel is endowed with properties affecting
the tumor stroma that deserve attention for the design of
novel combination treatments.

Material and Methods
Cell lines, drugs, and reagents
The A375M is a metastatic variant derived from the A375
human melanoma (American Type Culture Collection; ref. 17);
this cell line was characterized by short-tandem repeat proﬁling (AmpFlSTR Identiﬁler Plus PCR Ampliﬁcation kit;
Applied Biosystems) and compared with DNA ﬁngerprinting
databases. WM1552, WM115, and WM983A cell lines, derived
from patient melanomas, were kindly provided by Dr. Meenhard Herlyn (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA; ref. 18); the
WM1552/5 is a tumorigenic variant derived from WM1552 (19)
that underwent DNA ﬁngerprinting analysis (as above) to
conﬁrm the identity with the parental line.

Stocks of cell lines were stored frozen in liquid nitrogen and
kept in culture for no more than 8 weeks before injection. Cell
culture conditions are detailed in Supplementary Methods.
Paclitaxel (Indena S.p.A.), dacarbazine (Sanoﬁ Aventis),
recombinant human IL2 (IL2, Proleukin; Novartis), immunocytokine F8-IL2 (16), the isotype control KSF-IL2 (16), (SIP)F8Alexa Fluor 750 (15), and the anti-asialo GM1 antiserum (Wako
Chemical GmbH) were prepared and delivered as described in
Supplementary Methods.
Tumor samples
Specimens of melanomas were from patients at diagnosis;
ethical approval was obtained from the Local Research Ethics
Committee of the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena, Germany.
Xenograft specimens were from human melanoma growing
intradermal in nude mice (20). The spatial distribution and the
relation of EDA-Fn to vascular structures were shown with a
double ﬂuorescence labeling procedure for F8 reactive-EDA-Fn
and CD31 (21), as described in Supplementary Methods.
Mice and xenograft tumor models
Six- to 8-week-old female NCr-nu/nu mice (Harlan) were
used. Procedures involving animals and their care were conducted in conformity with institutional guidelines that comply
with national and international laws and policies (22, 23).
Orthotopic melanoma model
WM1552/5 (2  106 cells) was transplanted subcutaneously
in the ﬂank of nude mice which were then randomized for
treatment (N ¼ 10–12 per group) when tumors reached
approximately 100 to 150 mg. Mice were treated with paclitaxel
(20 mg/kg i.v.), dacarbazine (160 mg/kg i.p.), F8-IL2 (20
mg/mouse i.v.), KSF-IL2 (20 mg/mouse i.v.), or unconjugated
recombinant IL2 (6.6 mg/mouse i.v) as single agent or in
combination regimens. For the depletion of natural killer (NK)
cells, anti-asialo GM1 antiserum (200 mL/1:10 dilution i.v.) was
administered along the therapy. Schedule of treatments are
detailed in the Results. Animal management and data collection were carried out with the help of the Study Director 1.8
software (Studylog System, Inc.). Results were plotted as the
mean tumor weight against days after tumor randomization
and the efﬁcacy of treatment was expressed as tumor weight
and tumor growth delay (T  C ¼ median time to reach 500 mg
of treated tumor  median time to reach 500 mg of control
tumor; ref. 22). CR was deﬁned by absence of tumor for at least
3 months. Toxicity was monitored by recording body weight
loss.
Metastatic melanoma model
A375M (10  105 cells) was injected intravenously in the
tail vein of nude mice which were then randomized for
treatment (N ¼ 10 per arm) 7 days later. Mice were treated
with paclitaxel, F8-IL2 (same dose as above) as single agent
or in combination regimens as detailed in Results. Mice were
killed and lung harvested after 6 weeks of treatment. Metastases were counted blinded by 2 independent investigators
and expressed as number and size of tumor nodules in the
lung (17). The procedures for subcutaneous tumor and

metastasis evaluation are detailed in Supplementary
Methods.
In vivo imaging
Uptake of (SIP)F8-Alexa Fluor 750 in mice bearing WM1552/
5 tumors was analyzed with the eXplore Optix imaging system.
DCE-MRI was done after injection of the B22956/1 contrast
agent with a BioSpec 70/30 AVIII system (24). Data analysis is
in Supplementary Methods.
Histologic analyses
Analysis was carried out on WM1552/5 tumors from the
different treatment regimens harvested 24 hours after the end
of the third cycle (N ¼ 4/5 tumors per group). For vessel
perfusion analysis, mice were given Hoechst 33342 (40 mg/kg
i.v; Sigma) 1 minute before sacriﬁcing. Tumor sections were
CD31 stained for immunoﬂuorescence microscopy (22) and
immunostained with the antibody against Asialo-GM1 for the
detection of tumor-inﬁltrating NK cells. Evaluation analysis is
described in Supplementary Methods.

Results
EDA-Fn expression in metastatic melanomas and
selection of the xenograft models
Tumor specimens obtained from patients with metastatic
melanoma were evaluated for EDA-Fn expression using the
human recombinant SIP format antibody F8. Melanomas in
general showed an abundant deposition of F8 accessible EDAFn antigen in tumor vessels, as well as in the tumor interstitium
or in the stroma. Figure 1A and B show representative lymph
node metastases of a malignant melanoma with a polygonal
epitheloid/partially spindle shaped cell appearance and abundant stroma induction (Fig. 1A) and of a malignant melanoma
with the typically medullary growth pattern (Fig. 1B). Both
are characterized by a strong vascular and stromal positivity for EDA-Fn. The expression of EDA-Fn was studied in a
panel of human melanoma–derived xenografts, transplanted
orthotopically in the derma of nude mice. Interestingly,
the 4 human melanoma xenografts were characterized by a
highly diffuse EDA-Fn expression that fully replicated that
of the patient lesion (Fig. 1C–F). The WM1552/5 and the
A375M metastatic melanoma were chosen to evaluate the
therapeutic activity of the F8-IL2 immunocytokine in preclinical models.
The antitumor efﬁcacy of F8-IL2 immunocytokine is
enhanced by the combination with paclitaxel in human
melanoma xenografts
F8-IL2 alone and in combination regimens was tested on
human tumor xenografts. Treatments were done for 5 cycles
with chemotherapy administered 24 hours before the immunoconjugate (Treatment schedule in Fig. 2A).
Figures 2B and C show the therapeutic effects of F8-IL2
in combination with paclitaxel or dacarbazine on WM1552/5
melanoma growing subcutaneously in nude mice. F8-IL2 and
IL2 administered as single agents did not signiﬁcantly affect
tumor growth. Paclitaxel treatment caused a marginal, though

signiﬁcant, delay in growth compared with controls (T-C ¼ 8);
this delay was not improved by the addition of IL2 (T-C ¼ 10).
Only the addition of F8-IL2 to paclitaxel yielded a clear antimelanoma activity and induced the complete eradication of
WM1552/5 tumors (Fig. 2B). Nine of 11 (82%) mice were tumor
free, as conﬁrmed by histologic analysis at necropsy. The
injection of F8 antibody plus, but not conjugated to, IL2 had
no effect on tumor growth (data not shown).
By contrast, in a similar trial carried out with dacarbazine in
combination with F8-IL2 (Fig. 2C), no signiﬁcant therapeutic
beneﬁt was observed by combining the 2 treatments, despite
the ability of dacarbazine to cause a signiﬁcant, albeit limited,
growth delay as single agent (T-C ¼ 4 and T-C ¼ 6, for
dacarbazine alone and in combination, respectively). The
administration of IL2 conjugated to KSF that recognizes an
unrelated antigen (KSF-IL2), in combination with paclitaxel,
did not show advantage compared with paclitaxel alone
(Fig. 2D).

Noteworthy was the ﬁnding that the therapeutic performance of the combination therapies was not associated with
any signiﬁcant loss of body weight, indicating that the combination therapy regimens were well tolerated.
Paclitaxel increases the uptake of F8 antibody in
melanoma xenografts
The inﬂuence of paclitaxel on the delivery of F8-IL2 was
investigated in vivo by optical imaging of (SIP)F8-Alexa Fluor
750 tumor uptake in nude mice bearing subcutaneous
WM1552/5 and pretreated with paclitaxel, dacarbazine or
vehicle. Figure 3A shows representative images of vehicle-,
dacarbazine-, and paclitaxel-treated mice, the latter presenting
a distinguishably higher ﬂuorescence signal, which correspond
to a stronger uptake of (SIP)F8-Alexa Fluor 750 in the tumor,
compared with vehicle- or dacarbazine-treated mice. To evaluate the uptake of (SIP)F8-Alexa Fluor 750 in tumors according
to the different tumor weights (vehicle, mean ¼ 172 mg;
paclitaxel, mean ¼ 91 mg; dacarbazine, mean ¼ 136 mg; N
¼ 4 per group), the ﬂuorescence signals were calculated as the
ratio between photon counts and tumor weights (Fig. 3B).
Signals in the tumors of mice treated with paclitaxel was
signiﬁcantly higher compared with vehicle- or dacarbazinetreated animals, for both acquisitions done at 6 and 24 hours
after (SIP)F8-Alexa Fluor 750 injection.
Paclitaxel increases tumor vessel perfusion and
permeability in melanoma xenografts
To elucidate whether the paclitaxel-induced increase of F8
antibody uptake could be attributable to an altered tumor
physiology (25), perivascular Hoechst 33342 perfusion was
measured in tumors from animals treated with paclitaxel 24
hours before (Fig. 3C). The area perfused by Hoechst 33342 was
signiﬁcantly higher in paclitaxel-treated tumors compared
with controls (Fig. 3D). The injection of F8-IL2 or IL2 alone
did not modify the perfusion of Hoechst 33342 in tumors (data
not shown).
To obtain a more detailed analysis of tumor vessel functionality, paclitaxel- and vehicle-treated nude mice bearing
WM1552/5 melanoma xenografts (N ¼ 4 mice per group) were
analyzed by DCE-MRI 24 hours after paclitaxel administration
(Fig. 3E–G). To prevent perfusion and permeability from being
inﬂuenced by the size of lesions, paclitaxel- and vehicle-treated
tumors were weight-matched (mean ¼ 603 mg and 503 mg,
respectively).
The kinetics of the distribution of the contrast agent
(B22956/1) in the tumor core and rim were different. Tumor
rim, a 1-mm thick band starting from the tumor boundary, is
known to be hypervascularized whereas the core is often
characterized by the presence of necrotic areas (Fig. 3E I).
After paclitaxel treatment a signiﬁcant increase in the
fractional plasma volume (fPV), an MRI-based measure of
tumor perfusion, and transfer coefﬁcient (kTrans), an MRIderived quantity related to the extravasation of the contrast
agent, was observed both in tumor rim and core, suggesting
that the treatment with paclitaxel was able to enhance the
overall delivery of the albumin-binding contrast agent to the
pathologic tissue (Fig. 3E–G; ref. 26).

Paclitaxel with F8-IL2 Immunocytokine Inhibits Melanoma

Altogether, these data suggested that paclitaxel induced
transient functional modiﬁcations in tumors vessels, which
in turn could promote F8-IL2 delivery and tumor response.
The therapeutic efﬁcacy of the F8-IL2 immunocytokine
combined with paclitaxel is sequence dependent
To evaluate the impact of the ﬁndings above on drug
scheduling and tumor response, additional trials comparing
different sequences of drug administration were carried out
(Fig. 4). The time interval between treatments was prolonged
to 7 days to allow clearance of circulating F8-IL2. In this setting
paclitaxel as single agent only moderately affected the growth
of WM1552/5 human melanoma xenografts (T-C ¼ 7). In the
combination arm, the weekly schedule of F8-IL2 given 24 hours
after paclitaxel (paclitaxel ! F8-IL2) signiﬁcantly inhibited
WM1552/5 melanoma growth, with 5 of 11 (45.5%) CR,
thus conﬁrming the ﬁndings above (Fig. 4A). In the same study,

Figure 4. The efﬁcacy of the combination F8-IL2 plus paclitaxel depends
on the sequence of treatment administration. Nude mice bearing
subcutaneously established (150 mg) WM1552/5 melanoma were
treated (every 7 days for 4 cycles) with paclitaxel (20 mg/kg i.v.) or F8-IL2
(20 mg/mouse i.v.), as single therapy or in combination regimens,
according to the following schedules: (A) paclitaxel administered 24 or 4
hours before F8-IL2 (paclitaxel ! F8-IL2 and paclitaxel þ F8-IL2); (B)
paclitaxel administered 48 hours after F8-IL2 (F8-IL2 ! paclitaxel). Small
triangles indicate cycles of treatment. N ¼ 8–11 mice per group. CR,

F8-IL2 administered 4 hours after paclitaxel (paclitaxel þ
F8-IL2) showed a comparable therapeutic efﬁcacy with 6 of
11 (54.5%) CR. Cured mice were still tumor-free after 4 months,
when the experiment was terminated and mice necropsied.
Noncured tumors, after a signiﬁcant growth delay (T-C ¼ 29; 6
tumors for paclitaxel ! F8-IL2 and T-C ¼ 30; 5 tumors for
paclitaxel þ F8-IL2), resumed their growth at the same rate as
control-untreated tumors. By contrast, the efﬁcacy of the
combination was reduced with the inverted sequence of drug
administration (F8-IL2 ! paclitaxel; paclitaxel administered
48 hours after F8-IL2), but not signiﬁcantly different from
paclitaxel alone (Fig. 4B). With no mice being tumor-free at
the end of the study, no CRs were observed in this trial.
Effect of F8-IL2 and paclitaxel on host cell inﬁltration
The contribution of host immune cells to the therapeutic
effects of F8-IL2 combined with paclitaxel was analyzed in
WM1552/5 melanoma sections harvested from mice 24 hours
after the third cycle of treatments. F8-IL2 administered after
paclitaxel led to a massive inﬁltration of NK cells in WM1552/5
tumors that was signiﬁcantly higher than in lesions treated
with paclitaxel or F8-IL2 as single agents (Fig. 5A and B),
whereas the inverted sequence with F8-IL2 administered after
paclitaxel did not enhance NK cell inﬁltration (Fig. 5C and D).
Accordingly, IL2 had no effect on NK cell inﬁltration, and F8IL2 alone caused only a marginal recruitment. Notably, a
signiﬁcant increase of NK cells was seen in the paclitaxel-only
treated tumors (Fig. 5A–D), suggesting that paclitaxel is
endowed with immunomodulating properties (27). The host
inﬁltration of controls at randomization (day 0, mean tumor
weight ¼ 120 mg) and on the day of testing (mean tumor
weight ¼ 500 mg) was not different.
To examine the implication of NK cells on the growth
of WM1552/5, nude mice undergoing therapy with paclitaxel ! F8-IL2 were depleted of NK cells with anti-asialo
GM1. Figure 5E shows that in mice receiving anti-asialo
GM1, paclitaxel ! F8-IL2 was signiﬁcantly less efﬁcacious
in inhibiting the growth of WM1552/5 xenografts and
not signiﬁcantly different from paclitaxel alone. Anti-asialo
GM1 given to vehicle-treated tumor did not inﬂuence
tumor growth. These ﬁndings point to the contribution
of the host response to the therapeutic beneﬁt of the
combination.
Paclitaxel combined with F8-IL2 reduced distant
metastasis by melanoma
The therapeutic efﬁcacy of F8-IL2 immunocytokine in combination with paclitaxel was assessed on lung tumor nodules
formed by the A375M melanoma. Treatment started 7 days
after tumor injection, when tumor foci were established in the
lung of nude mice (17). According to the ﬁndings above
paclitaxel was given 24 hours before F8-IL2 and therapy
repeated weekly for 6 cycles. As shown in the representative
lungs of Fig. 6A, F8-IL2 did not affect metastasis, whereas
paclitaxel-based chemotherapy inhibited the growth of tumor
nodules (tumor burden, Fig. 6C), but not the overall number of
colonies in the lung (colony number, Fig. 6B). Only the combination of paclitaxel with F8-IL2 signiﬁcantly reduced both

Supplementary Table S1).

Discussion
Our study shows in mouse xenograft models of human
melanoma that paclitaxel has a synergistic antitumor effect
with the immunocytokine F8-IL2 by favoring its tumor uptake
and potentiating its antitumor efﬁcacy. This treatment modality induced CR of the WM1552/5 melanoma transplanted
subcutis in nude mice and inhibited metastasis to the lung
from the A375M.
The therapeutic performance of the F8-IL2-paclitaxel seems
to be contingent on the pattern of positivity for EDA-Fn: in
responsive melanoma, this Fn isoform was highly expressed in
vessel walls and in the tumor interstitial space (Fig. 1). At
variance the same combination was moderately active in a
model of ovarian cancer in which EDA-Fn expression was
restricted to the perivascular space only (Supplementary
Results and Supplementary Fig. S1). Noteworthy, our ﬁndings
are in agreement with the results of Natali and colleagues,
showing EDA-Fn expression associated with melanoma
metastatic lesions (14). Altogether these ﬁndings suggest

1820

Cancer Res; 72(7) April 1, 2012

that vascular targeting based therapy should be adapted to
the individual features of patient's tumor; in the case of
melanoma, this tumor type is putatively a ﬁtting candidate
for immunoconjugated based therapy using the F8 antibody as
a vehicle.
Our data also show that the therapeutic efﬁcacy of F8-IL2 is
signiﬁcantly improved by combining certain chemotherapeutic agents—here we show paclitaxel—but not others, such as
dacarbazine. The increased uptake of ﬂuorescent F8 antibody
in the tumors of mice pretreated with paclitaxel, but not with
dacarbazine, supports its use in this combination setting.
Because Hoechst 33342 staining used as an indicator of vascular perfusion (28) was increased in the tumors of mice
treated with paclitaxel, we hypothesized an increase of tumor
perfusion. Surprisingly, although IL2 had previously been
shown to increase vascular permeability in patient healthy
tissue and in tumor-bearing mice (29, 30), a similar effect was
not observed in our studies when the fusion protein F8-IL2 was
used as single agent. The resistance of tumor tissue to IL2induced increase vascular permeability could be expression of
the angiogenic phenotype of tumor endothelial cells (more
resistant to IL2 direct toxic effect) or to the different cytokine
milieu of tumor tissue.

Subsequent DCE-MRI studies on mice pretreated with paclitaxel showed a signiﬁcant increase in tumor perfusion (fPV)
and in vessel permeability (kTrans), suggesting that these
modiﬁcations improve distribution of the immunocytokine.
Of further note was our use as contrast agent of gadocoletic
acid trisodium salt (B22956/1), which belongs to the class of
albumin binder agents. Given that the fractional binding of the
gadocoletate ion to animal and human serum albumin is
estimated at around 90% (31), we can conclude that in our
tumor model paclitaxel is ultimately able to induce an increase
in B22956/1-labeled albumin extravasations (represented by
the increase of kTrans values) partially through its ability to
increase fPV in the leaky tumor vessels. The molecular weights
of the F8 antibody in SIP format (80 kDa; imaging study) and in
scFv-IL2 format (86 kDa for the noncovalent homodimer used
for the therapy study) are comparable with the one of albumin.
It is reasonable to conclude that one of the therapeutically
relevant actions of paclitaxel consist in mediating an increased
vascular permeability at the tumor site. The increased vascular
permeability could be attributable to the effect of paclitaxel on
tumor angiogenesis (32, 33). However at the dose/schedule
used in this study we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant changes in vessel
number, area, and diameter (Supplementary Fig. S2), so
increased perfusion/permeability is presumably not caused

www.aacrjournals.org

by a direct effect on tumor vascularization. Instead our ﬁndings are in line with results from other Authors. Jain and
colleagues showed that paclitaxel is able to reduce tumor
interstitial ﬂuid pressure (IFP) and decompress tumor blood
vessels. The observation that these effects are no more evident
in taxane-resistant tumors supports the hypothesis that the
solid stress generated by neoplastic cell proliferation determines the increase in tumor vascular resistance (through the
compression of tumor vessels) and in IFP (34). Thus, a reduction in tumor cell density through the use of a conventional
cytotoxic drug ultimately decompresses blood vessels and,
hence, reduces microvascular resistance and IFP and increases
tumor perfusion (34). However, the theory of solid stress in
tumors only partially explains the biologic mechanisms by
which taxanes induce changes in vessel parameters. Indeed,
another study showed that paclitaxel and docetaxel lowered
IFP and signiﬁcantly increased albumin extravasation regardless of their cytotoxic activity, suggesting that these effects
could be taxane speciﬁc and related to pharmacodynamics of
these drugs (35).
Elevated IFP is the major physiologic barrier to the delivery
of macromolecules. It reduces the minimal physiologic extravasation of albumin that normally accounts for interstitial
oncotic pressure (36) and could explain the inadequate

delivery and therapeutic efﬁcacy of F8-IL2 when administered
as monotherapy. With the coadministration of paclitaxel, the
antibody is likely able to reach the tumor at the right plasma
concentration, to extravasate and accumulate in the perivascular and interstitial space of the tumor.
The translational potential of these ﬁndings is substantiated
by clinical studies. In breast cancer patients treated with
neoadjuvant chemotherapy, paclitaxel decreased IFP and
increased oxygenation, whereas doxorubicin did not produce
any signiﬁcant change (25); this ﬁnding suggests that at least
these tumors would be better treated ﬁrst with paclitaxel to
reduce IFP and increase pO2 to improve the delivery of
subsequent therapy, in particular of large molecules such as
antibodies. Further studies are needed to clarify the mechanism of this sequencing.
These ﬁndings, suggesting that tumors would be better
treated with paclitaxel ﬁrst to improve subsequent drug delivery, have prompted us to evaluate the sequencing of paclitaxel
and F8-IL2 to maximize tumor response. We found that
paclitaxel administered 4 or 24 hours before F8-IL2 was more
efﬁcacious than F8-IL2 ﬁrst followed by paclitaxel. In the
last sequence paclitaxel was administered 48 hours after F8IL2, a time sufﬁcient for the clearance of the antibody from
circulation. Here we used a recombinant antibody in scFv
format to develop an immunocytokine with adequate tumor
targeting and rapid clearance (16, 37). Further investigations,
however, will be necessary to ascertain whether paclitaxel can
also increase the tumor uptake of conventional IgG-based
therapeutics.
In previous studies with IL2-based immunocytokines, the
antitumor activity was traced principally to NK cells (16, 38).
Here we found that F8-IL2 combined with paclitaxel induced a
massive inﬁltration of NK cells in WM1552/5 tumors that was
signiﬁcantly greater than what occurred in xenografts treated
with either of the 2 agents singly. We suggest that paclitaxelcaused increased permeability leads to the accumulation of F8IL2 in the interstitium of the tumor (where abundant EDA-Fn
can be found), resulting in a local activation and mitogenic
activity for NK cells. The hypothesis that NK cells mediate the
therapeutic activity of the immunocytokine with paclitaxel was
reinforced by the observation that NK cell depletion in tumorbearing mice abolishes the therapeutic gain associated to the
combined use of F8-IL2 with paclitaxel. Furthermore, an
increase of F4-80þ macrophages in tumors from mice receiving
F8-IL2/paclitaxel (Supplementary Fig. S3) was also observed,
thus calling for a more complex implication of the host in the
therapeutic activity of the immunocytokine.
Notably, a signiﬁcant increase in Asialo-GM1þ NK cells was
also observed in tumors treated with paclitaxel alone, suggesting that the taxane possesses immunomodulating properties.
These ﬁndings speak for a role of paclitaxel in boosting this
response to F8-IL2. Indeed, there is an emerging body of data
conﬁrming that paclitaxel, like other related taxanes, displays
immunomodulatory properties that endorse its therapeutic
application beyond tumor chemotherapy (27, 39).
We are aware of the possible limits of studies done in
immunodeﬁcient nude mice, in which most of the immunomodulating effects were underestimated and restricted to

1822

innate immunity (nude mice cannot generate mature T lymphocytes; ref. 40). Indeed, in some tumor models, T cells have
also been shown to contribute to the action of IL2-based
immunocytokines (41). Nevertheless, in a number of cancer
models based on the grafting of murine tumors in syngeneic
mouse strains, the therapeutic activity of IL2-based immunocytokines was comparable when immunocompetent mice or
immunocompromised mice (which still had NK cells) were
used (38).
Attempts to treat melanoma patients with high dose IL2
have been conducted for more than 2 decades (42). However,
the modest beneﬁts achieved by treatment regimens including
this cytokine must be weighed against the serious side effects.
In our study in melanoma-bearing mice the targeted delivery of
IL2 to the tumor allowed repeated and well-tolerated administrations of F8-IL2; more importantly, the administration in
combination with paclitaxel did not seem to cause any cumulative toxicity. Paralleling our ﬁndings 2 different IL2-based
immunocytokines (L19-IL2 and F16-IL2; refs. 37, 38) are currently being investigated in phase II clinical trials for different
indications and in combinations with cytotoxic agents (43). A
large variation in response to IL2-based immunocytokine
treatment, in combination with dacarbazine, has been
observed in a recent phase IIa trial in patients with metastatic
melanoma, ranging from patients who did not respond to
treatment to a set of patients (29%) who enjoyed a RECISTconﬁrmed partial or complete response (43). It is still unclear
whether these large interpatient differences are due to a
variability in the uptake of the immunocytokine at site of
disease, or rather to the immunologic features of individual
patients (e.g., different tumor-associated antigens presented by
the tumor, different cytokine environment, or different activity
of T and NK cells).
In conclusion, these preclinical results point to a significant beneﬁt resulting from the combination of the immunocytokine F8-IL2 with paclitaxel for the treatment of
metastatic melanoma, a tumor that historically has been
resistant to chemotherapy. Paclitaxel, when administered
ﬁrst, seems to enhance the antibody-targeted delivery of IL2
to tumors that selectively express EDA-Fn, thereby improving the therapeutic index of the cytokine. We found that
paclitaxel alone was able to affect the growth of metastatic
lesions, but only its combination with F8-IL2 signiﬁcantly
reduced tumor nodules in the lung of nude mice. Should our
present ﬁndings be conﬁrmed by further investigations, the
EDA-Fn expression pattern in lesions and the scheduling of
drug administration will prove to be critical factors to take
into account with this new biopharmaceutical agent. As the
control of visceral metastases remains a main challenge in
the treatment of melanoma patients (44), the therapeutic
modalities and results reported herein should have an
impact on the design of immunocytokine-based clinical
trials in patients with melanoma and other malignancies,
in combination with chemotherapeutic agents.
