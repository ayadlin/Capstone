Abstract
Poorly differentiated tumors in non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) have been associated with shorter patient
survival and shorter time to recurrence following treatment. Here, we integrate multiple experimental models
with clinicopathologic analysis of patient tumors to delineate a cellular hierarchy in NSCLC. We show that the
oncofetal protein 5T4 is expressed on tumor-initiating cells and associated with worse clinical outcome in
NSCLC. Coexpression of 5T4 and factors involved in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were observed in
undifferentiated but not in differentiated tumor cells. Despite heterogeneous expression of 5T4 in NSCLC
patient–derived xenografts, treatment with an anti-5T4 antibody–drug conjugate resulted in complete and
sustained tumor regression. Thus, the aggressive growth of heterogeneous solid tumors can be blocked by
therapeutic agents that target a subpopulation of cells near the top of the cellular hierarchy. Cancer Res; 71(12);

Introduction
Non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths, due to high incidence and lack of
effective therapies (1). NSCLC has heterogeneous pathologies
and molecular profiles, which presents challenges to molecular targeting and treatment (2–4). The degree of tumor cell
differentiation is an independent prognostic factor for clinical
outcome, as less differentiated tumors are associated with
increased risk of death in both squamous cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma (5). Strikingly, less differentiated tumors are
also associated with increased risk of recurrence after resection (5). The molecular and cellular bases for these associations are not understood.
Investigation of the cellular heterogeneity in tumors has
encouraged new frameworks, such as the cancer stem cell

hypothesis, for understanding the cellular hierarchy as it
relates to disease progression and for designing therapeutic
strategies (6–8). These experiments have shown that capacities for self-renewal and differentiation vary among cells in a
given tumor. The types and relative proportions of various cell
subpopulations in solid tumors are likely major determinants
of disease progression and therapeutic responsiveness in
cancer patients. In many cases, only certain subpopulations
of cancer cells from a tumor can initiate tumor growth in
immunodeficient mice. Herein, these cells are referred to as
tumor-initiating cells (TIC); they are also known in the literature as cancer stem cells and cancer-initiating cells (6–8).
TICs have been isolated, enriched, or identified in tumors of
brain, breast, colon, head and neck, lung, melanocytes, pancreas, prostate, and the hematopoietic system, typically with
antibodies against cell surface markers (9). In general, the
tumors grown from TICs recapitulate the cellular heterogeneity of the original tumor, which underscores the developmental plasticity of many TICs and the differentiation
hierarchy in many tumor tissues.
Tumor cell subpopulations and their distinct roles in disease progression can be studied using a variety of complementary approaches (8). The isolation of defined cell
subpopulations from tumors, xenografts, and established cell
lines based on cell surface markers allows for an in-depth
molecular analysis of rather homogeneous subpopulations.
The culturing of cancer cells in defined serum-free media and/
or 3-dimensional (3D) matrices has been shown to maintain
karyotype, transcriptome, and signaling that are reflective of
the tissue of origin (10, 11). Patient-derived xenografts (PDX)

are established directly from freshly resected tumors and
exhibit rich architectures that reflect the original patient
tumors. PDXs are complex yet tractable preclinical models
that can be used to study cellular heterogeneity and evaluate
the efficacy of therapeutic agents.
Here, we apply these emerging frameworks and technologies to delineate a cellular hierarchy in NSCLC and apply the
new knowledge to drug discovery. By integrating novel experimental models of NSCLC with the clinicopathologic analysis
of patient tumors, we identify the 5T4 oncofetal antigen as a
marker of undifferentiated, highly tumorigenic cells and of
worse clinical outcome. We show preclinical efficacy of an
anti-5T4 antibody–drug conjugate (ADC) and suggest that this
therapeutic strategy could be applied to other surface markers
expressed on TICs.

Materials and Methods
Isolation and serum-free culture of human lung
tumor cells
Human lung tumor tissue (sample 87426A1) was obtained
from Asterand in accordance with appropriate consent procedures, washed in PBS, and minced. Fragments were disaggregated with collagenase III (250 U/mL) at 37 C for 2 to 3 hrs.
Partially digested tissue fragments were passed through steel
mesh screens. Cells were sieved through a 40-mm cell strainer
(BD Falcon) and treated with red blood cell lysis buffer
(Roche). Dead cells were excluded by magnetic separation
(Miltenyi Biotec). The culture was established and maintained
in serum-free bronchial epithelial cell growth medium (BEGM;
Lonza), which was changed 50% every other day.
Air–liquid interface cultures
Millicell 1-mm PET hanging cell culture inserts (Millipore)
were seeded with 2.5  105 cells from 87426A1 culture. After
1 to 2 days, the upper and lower chambers were rinsed with
PBS, and CnT-23 medium (CELLnTec) containing 50 nmol/L
retinoic acid and 1 mmol/L CaCl2 was added only to the
lower chamber, leaving cells exposed to the air. Lifted
cultures were fed every other day with fresh medium or
harvested in Buffer RLT (Qiagen) for RNA isolation or TBS/
0.5% NP-40 for immunoblot analysis. For gene expression
profiling, "undifferentiated" values are averages of triplicate
samples, and "differentiated" values, due to limited sample,
were averaged from differentiation time points of 8, 16, and
24 days.
Animal studies
All animal studies were approved by the Pfizer Pearl River
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee according to
established guidelines. To assess tumorigenic potential of
sorted cells, the cells were implanted in 50% Matrigel or
where noted, 50% growth factor–reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) subcutaneously between the shoulder blades.
60257A1 cells were implanted in NOD-SCID (severe combined
immunodeficient) mice and tumor incidence was recorded
after 9 weeks. For H460T and HCC2429, 100 sorted cells were
implanted per nu/nu mouse. Tumors were measured at least

www.aacrjournals.org

once a week with tumor volume ¼ 0.5  width2  length. The
P values are based on 2-sided Student's t test. Efficacy studies
are described in Supplementary Information.
Clinical samples
This study was approved by the MD Anderson Institutional
Review Board. Tissue specimens were collected between 1997
and 2002 from 320 lung cancer tumors (204 adenocarcinomas
and 116 squamous cell carcinomas), and selected specimens
were used for construction of tissue microarrays. The primary
antibodies used for immunohistochemistry were mouse
monoclonal anti-CD24 (Clone SN3b; LabVision), rabbit polyclonal anti-CD44 (Sigma), and mouse monoclonal anti-5T4
(MAB4975, R&D Systems). The statistical analysis was based
on membrane expression levels as described in Supplementary Data.
Additional Materials and Methods can be found in the
Supplementary Data.

Results
A cell line model reveals 5T4 expression in TICs
To identify a model of tumor heterogeneity in NSCLC, we
screened several cell lines for heterogeneous expression of cell
surface markers that had previously been used to enrich or
isolate TICs (6, 9). Staining of the H460T cell line with antiCD24 and anti-CD44 antibodies revealed distinct subpopulations of cells with a stable distribution over many passages in
culture (Fig. 1A and data not shown). The delineation between
CD24/lo and CD24hi was readily apparent; the threshold for
CD44 was based on the isotype control. To determine whether
these subpopulations had different tumorigenic capacities, we
isolated cells of each subpopulation by fluorescence-activated
cell sorting (FACS) and implanted them subcutaneously into
immunocompromised mice. CD24/loCD44hi cells formed
large tumors rapidly, whereas CD24hiCD44hi cells exhibited
slower tumor growth (P < 0.001; Fig. 1B). Tumors from
CD24/loCD44hi cells were also larger than tumors from
CD24/loCD44lo cells (P < 0.02; Supplementary Fig. S1A). In
vitro, CD24/loCD44hi cells migrated more efficiently than
CD24hiCD44hi cells and exhibited multipotency in that they
gave rise to less tumorigenic CD24hiCD44hi cells (Supplementary Fig. S1 and data not shown). Together these results
indicated that the CD24/loCD44hi combination of surface
markers enriched for TICs in H460T. Similar results were
observed for another NSCLC cell line, HCC2429 (data not
shown).
To establish the clinical relevance of these results, we
examined CD24 and CD44 expression in patient samples.
By immunohistochemistry, CD24/loCD44hi membrane
expression was associated with less differentiated tumor
histology (P ¼ 0.0456). CD24/loCD44hi membrane expression
was also associated with worse overall survival in male
squamous cell carcinoma (P ¼ 0.0310; Supplementary
Fig. S2A). In addition, analysis of published mRNA data (12)
revealed that CD24/loCD44hi was associated with worse
overall survival in adenocarcinomas (P ¼ 0.0501; Supplementary Fig. S2B). Taken together, these results showed that the

TIC markers identified in H460T and HCC2429 were also poor
prognosis markers in NSCLC, which indicates the clinical
relevance of the cell line models.
From a therapeutic perspective, it is not feasible to target
the CD24/loCD44hi combination of markers. Therefore, we
sought to identify novel TIC markers in NSCLC that could be
potential therapeutic targets. We generated gene expression
profiles from triplicate samples of sorted CD24/loCD44hi and
CD24hiCD44hi cells from H460T (Supplementary Fig. S1E). The
5T4 (TPBG) gene had significantly higher expression in
the more tumorigenic CD24/loCD44hi cells than in the
CD24hiCD44hi cells (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S1).
Consistent with this result, in NSCLC clinical samples, 5T4
mRNA expression was significantly higher in CD24/loCD44hi
versus "Not CD24/loCD44hi" tumors (ref. 12; P ¼ 0.0293;
Supplementary Fig. S2C).
5T4 is a single-pass transmembrane protein that is preferentially expressed in many tumor types compared with normal tissues (13) and has been explored as a cancer target.
During embryonic development, 5T4 functions in epithelialto-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cell migration, at least
in part by interacting with CXCR4 and/or the actin cytoske-

leton (14–17). Given the oncofetal characteristics of 5T4 and
its increased expression in the tumorigenic CD24/loCD44hi
subpopulation of H460T, we focused on 5T4 as a potential TIC
marker in NSCLC.
Immunofluorescence studies in H460T revealed that staining for 5T4 and CD24 were mutually exclusive, consistent with
the gene expression data, and moreover that most if not all
CD24/lo cells expressed 5T4 (Fig. 1D). This result was
extended by flow cytometric (Supplementary Fig. S3) and
immunoblot analysis (Fig. 1E).
On the basis of the expression of 5T4 in normal progenitor
cells during embryonic development (18), we hypothesized
that 5T4 expression is associated with a less differentiated
state and that inducing differentiation of tumor cells would
reduce 5T4 expression. Sorted cells were treated with
retinoic acid and subjected to immunoblot analysis.
Indeed, 5T4 expression was dramatically reduced in treated
CD24/loCD44hi cells (Fig. 1E).
To test tumorigenicity based on 5T4 expression, we sorted
cells from a clonal line of H460T and implanted them into
mice. As predicted, 5T4hi cells were more tumorigenic than
5T4/lo cells (P < 0.03; Fig. 1F), which indicated that 5T4 can

independently enrich for TICs in this system. On the basis of
all of these results, we sought to further establish 5T4 as a
novel TIC antigen by using PDXs.
5T4 enriches for tumorigenicity in a PDX
We established NSCLC PDX lines by implanting fragments
of freshly resected tumors (squamous cell carcinoma) subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice. Each line was
propagated by explanting xenograft fragments into naive
animals and was maintained exclusively in vivo. In each
PDX line, the histology of the xenograft resembled that of
the original tumor (data not shown).
To determine whether 5T4 expression enriched for tumorigenic capacity in PDXs, 5T4hi and 5T4/lo cells were sorted
from dissociated 60257A1 PDXs and implanted into animals.
Cells from this PDX line exhibited a wide continuous range of
5T4 expression levels, and the highest and lowest 15% were
assigned 5T4hi and 5T4/lo (Fig. 2A). 5T4hi cells yielded substantially higher tumor incidence than 5T4/lo cells in 3
independent experiments (Table 1). On the basis of limiting
dilution analysis, 5T4hi cells were about 30-fold more tumorigenic than 5T4/lo cells when implanted in 50% growth
factor–reduced Matrigel (Table 1). To determine whether
tumorigenicity was dependent on growth factors, as reported
previously (19), the experiment was repeated 2 additional
times in regular Matrigel. The tumorigenicity of 5T4/lo cells
was slightly enhanced in these conditions but was still significantly lower than that of 5T4hi cells (Table 1). Tumors that
grew from sorted 5T4hi cells showed heterogeneous 5T4
expression (Fig. 2B). Thus, the results in the PDX are consistent with those from H460T and show that 5T4hi expression
can enrich for TICs in NSCLC.
To uncover molecular differences between 5T4hi and
5T4/lo cells, we generated gene expression profiles from cells
sorted on 3 independent occasions from 60257A1. Strikingly,
the Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP, also known as uteroglobin, SCGB1A) was expressed 20-fold higher in 5T4hi cells
than in 5T4/lo cells (Fig. 2C). CCSP has been characterized as
a marker of lung stem cells in normal tissue and adenocarcinoma (20). In addition, several genes associated with tumorigenesis, invasion, and stem cells were expressed at higher
levels in 5T4hi cells including carcinoembryonal antigens
CEACAM6 and CEACAM1, cathepsin S (CTSS), gelsolin
(GSN), and interleukin (IL) 8 (Fig. 2C). In contrast, low levels
of CD133 were comparable in both populations (Supplementary Fig. S4A). In summary, the gene expression profiles
distinguished the 5T4hi and 5T4/lo populations and offered
potential explanations for their different tumor-initiating
capacities.
5T4 and markers of EMT are expressed in cells near the
top of the tumor hierarchy
Immunohistochemical analysis of our PDXs revealed a
range of 5T4 expression levels and patterns. Three of 6
PDX lines exhibited heterogeneous expression of 5T4, and
in 2 of the 3, 5T4 expression was coupled to tumor architecture in that expression was higher at the tumor–stroma
interface (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Notably,

www.aacrjournals.org

in 37622A1, a pattern similar to 5T4 was observed for vimentin, a marker of EMT, and Ki67, a proliferation marker
(Fig. 3A). Coimmunostaining confirmed that 5T4hi cells were
typically positive for Ki67 in this PDX line (Fig. 3B).
When a serum-free culture was established from the
37622A1 PDX (Fig. 3C), the cells exhibited uniformly high
5T4 expression, whereas the PDX exhibited a broader expression range (Fig. 3D). Because the culture media supports
growth of undifferentiated cells, this result was consistent
with the hypothesis that 5T4 is highly expressed on TICs.
Strikingly, when the cultured cells were implanted into animals, the resulting tumors exhibited heterogeneous 5T4
expression (Fig. 3E and Supplementary Fig. S4C). This result
suggested that 5T4hi cells gave rise to 5T4/lo cells during
tumor growth by a mechanism that potentially requires
tumor–stroma interaction or other microenvironmental cues.
To further investigate the cellular hierarchy in NSCLC, we
developed a novel 3D model of lung cancer differentiation. In a
serum-free culture established directly from freshly resected
tumor (sample 87426A1), cells could either be maintained in
the undifferentiated state submerged in stem cell media or be
induced to differentiate at the air–liquid interface with retinoic acid but notably without the use of serum (Fig. 4A). The
air–liquid interface is considered a physiologic environment
for lung cells and used to study differentiation of immortalized
bronchial epithelial cells (21). The 87426A1 culture efficiently
formed a 3D multilayered epithelium on exposure to the air–
liquid interface for 18 days (Fig. 4B).
Immunoblot analysis showed that 5T4 levels were high in
the undifferentiated state and decreased quickly and dramatically on differentiation (Fig. 4C). This result was analogous to
retinoic acid treatment of sorted H460T cells (Fig. 1E).
To obtain a global view of the cellular hierarchy in NSCLC,
gene expression profiles were generated from undifferentiated
and differentiated cells. Consistent with the above results, 5T4
expression decreased and CD24 expression increased during
differentiation (Fig. 4D and E). These data were confirmed by
flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S5). The profiles revealed
striking patterns of genes involved in EMT and angiogenesis.
The EMT markers vimentin, fibronectin, Slug, and Twist were
expressed at significantly higher levels in undifferentiated cells
(Fig. 4D); in contrast, the epithelial differentiation markers
mucin and involucrin as well as transglutaminase (TGM) and
cytokeratins were expressed at significantly higher levels in
differentiated cells (Fig. 4E). The coexpression of 5T4 and
vimentin in undifferentiated cells was consistent with the
similar expression patterns of 5T4 and vimentin in 37622A1
PDX (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, angiogenesis factors, including
VEGF-A, VEGF-C, PDGF-A (platelet-derived growth factor),
PGF (placental growth factor), and uPA (urokinase-type plasminogen activator), were expressed at significantly higher
levels in undifferentiated cells (Fig. 4F). These results are
noteworthy given the higher 5T4 expression at the tumor–
stroma interface in 2 of our 6 PDX lines.
An unbiased meta-analysis revealed several gene signatures
with significant expression changes during differentiation
(Supplementary Table S2). Gene sets with higher expression
in undifferentiated cells included signatures of poor clinical

results show a cellular hierarchy in a primary NSCLC culture

Correlation between 5T4 expression and
clinicopathologic features and disease outcomes
We sought to determine whether 5T4 expression in NSCLC
tumors correlated with clinicopathologic features and disease
outcomes. In a panel of surgically resected tumors, 5T4
expression levels and patterns varied, and each sample was
assigned an overall score. The distribution of 5T4 expression

Figure 5. 5T4 expression in NSCLC is associated with worse clinical
outcome. A, 5T4 expression in NSCLC is associated with worse overall
survival in patients. B, 5T4 expression in NSCLC is associated with shorter
time to recurrence in patients.

according to clinicopathologic characteristics is shown in
Supplementary Table S3. Notably, membranous 5T4 expression was higher in poorly and moderately versus well-differentiated tumors (P ¼ 0.0005 and P ¼ 0.0197, respectively, with
overall ANOVA yielding P ¼ 0.0022; see Supplementary
Table S4). In addition, high membranous 5T4 expression
was associated with shorter survival time (P ¼ 0.0283,
Fig. 5A; and P ¼ 0.078 in multivariate analysis, Supplementary
Table S5) and shorter time to recurrence (P ¼ 0.0495, Fig. 5B;
and P ¼ 0.034 in multivariate analysis, Supplementary
Table S5). When the cohort was stratified by 5T4hi and
5T4/lo, there was no difference in the impact of patient
treatment on clinical outcome (not shown). These observations are consistent with our experimental results that indicate that 5T4 is associated with less differentiated, more
tumorigenic cells in NSCLC.
An ADC is specifically cytotoxic to 5T4-expressing cells
Taken together, these results provided the rationale for
targeting 5T4-expressing cells with an ADC even in tumors
with heterogeneous 5T4 expression. Unconjugated anti-5T4
monoclonal antibody has not exhibited any in vitro activity or
in vivo efficacy (22). To generate the ADC, anti-5T4 antibody

www.aacrjournals.org

(13), previously shown to internalize into cells (22), was
conjugated to the enediyne natural product calicheamicin,
a DNA-damaging agent (ref. 23; Fig. 6A). To show specificity
for 5T4-expressing cells, in vitro experiments were carried out
on sorted H460T cells. In a proliferation assay, the 5T4enriched population was greater than 10-fold more sensitive
to the ADC than the 5T4-low population (Fig. 6B). In a colony
formation assay in which cells were treated with drug and
then seeded at low density, the 5T4-enriched population was
similarly greater than 10-fold more sensitive to the ADC than
the 5T4-low population (Fig. 6C). In contrast, no difference in
sensitivities was observed when the 2 populations were treated with calicheamicin alone, anti-CD22 calicheamicin ADC,
camptothecin, 5-fluoruracil, or ionizing radiation (data not
shown). These results showed the specificity of the anti-5T4
ADC.
Regression of tumors with heterogeneous 5T4
expression with an anti-5T4 ADC
We hypothesized that a therapeutic agent that targets and
eliminates 5T4hi-expressing TICs could ultimately cause
regression of tumors despite heterogeneous expression of
5T4 within the tumor. The stable chemical linker between
antibody and drug restricts the release of calicheamicin to
cells that internalize the ADC (24). We assessed the efficacy of
an anti-5T4 ADC on the growth of 2 PDX lines with heterogeneous 5T4 expression. In both lines, 5T4 expression was
predominant at the tumor–stroma interface, but the overall
5T4 expression level was higher in 37622A1 than 60274A1
(Supplementary Fig. S4B and D). 37622A1 tumors harbored a
K-ras G13V mutation, whereas 60274A1 tumors had wild-type
K-ras (Fig. 6D and E).
PDX tumors were treated with anti-5T4 ADC, anti-CD33
ADC or vehicle; the anti-CD33 ADC served as a negative
control because these PDX lines do not express CD33 (data
not shown). In 37622A1, treatment with anti-5T4 ADC
regressed the tumors, and no regrowth was observed even
3 months after the last dose; in contrast, treatment with antiCD33 ADC or vehicle did not inhibit tumor growth (Fig. 6D).
Similarly, in 60274A1, treatment with anti-5T4 ADC regressed
the tumors despite the lower 5T4 expression in this line
(Fig. 6E). Treatment with calicheamicin (not conjugated to
an antibody) has not shown any significant impact on tumor
growth (22, 24, 25).
In contrast to the efficacy observed with anti-5T4 ADC,
treatment of both PDXs with cisplatin at the maximum
tolerable dose regressed tumors only transiently and the
tumors regrew after treatment was completed (Fig. 6E and
Supplementary Fig. S6). These results highlight the superior
long-term efficacy of an ADC that targets TICs as compared
with a conventional chemotherapeutic.

Discussion
5T4 and the cellular hierarchy in NSCLC
Using an integrated strategy, we have delineated a cellular
hierarchy in NSCLC and identified 5T4 as a clinically relevant
marker that can enrich for TICs. We found that 5T4 expression

was associated with high tumorigenic capacity and the undifferentiated state; these results parallel the expression of 5T4 in
cycling progenitor cells during embryonic development (18).
The association of 5T4 expression with EMT in tumors,
observed in the 87426A1 serum-free culture and the
37622A1 PDX, mirrors the association of 5T4 with EMT in
normal development (15). Our results are consistent with a
recent study that described the relationship between EMT and
stem cell phenotypes in normal and cancerous tissues (26).
Expression of 5T4 has been associated with advanced
disease and/or poor prognosis in colorectal, ovarian, and
gastric cancers (27–29). We found that 5T4 is associated with
less differentiated tumor histology, shorter time to recurrence,

and worse overall survival in NSCLC. Interestingly, although
CD133 was used to isolate NSCLC TICs (30, 31) and was
expressed in drug-tolerant PC9 cells (32), its expression in
NSCLC was not associated with patient survival (33). On the
basis of the published observation that CD133þ cells are
quiescent (30) and our observation in a different model that
5T4hi cells are proliferating, we speculate that CD133þ and
5T4hi might define different TIC populations even in the same
NSCLC tumor—analogous to the emerging evidence for distinct stem cell populations (e.g., quiescent vs. active/proliferating, in normal tissues; ref. 34). The clinical relevance of the
5T4 marker suggests that 5T4hi TICs contribute directly to one
or more aspects of disease progression in NSCLC. For

A Cellular Hierarchy in NSCLC

instance, 5T4hi TICs may contribute to metastasis, as that
process might originate when cells in a primary epithelial
tumor undergo EMT (35).
The morphologic heterogeneity observed in NSCLC and
other epithelial tumors is likely paralleled by a continuum of
tumor-initiating capabilities. In other words, the term "TIC"
refers to a quantitative trait that is influenced not only by
cancer cell autonomous signaling but also by cellular context
(e.g., neighboring malignant cells and the tumor microenvironment). For instance, the tumorigenicity of defined cell
populations can depend on parameters such as mouse strain
and the use of Matrigel (19, 36). We found a similar effect in
that the 5T4/lo cells yielded higher tumor incidence when
implanted with regular Matrigel as opposed to growth factor–
reduced Matrigel. Furthermore we observed 2 examples of
context-dependent TIC behavior: the uniformly 5T4hi cells in
the PDX-derived culture gave rise to tumors with heterogeneous 5T4 expression (Fig. 3) and the uniformly 5T4hi cells in
the tumor-derived culture gave rise to cells with dramatically
reduced 5T4 expression under differentiation conditions in
vitro (Fig. 4). Xenografts and serum-free cultures can be
complementary models to study tumor cell plasticity, hierarchy, and stromal interaction.
Therapeutic targeting of a TIC antigen
5T4 is an oncofetal protein as defined by expression during
embryonic development and in cancer but little expression in
normal adult tissues. Recent work showed the importance of
another oncofetal protein, L1CAM, in glioblastoma TICs (37).
Unconjugated antibodies directed at TIC surface markers
might affect TIC survival, differentiation, and/or interaction
with stroma, but many of them are expected to have limited
single-agent activity in the clinic. Our data provide preclinical
proof of concept for targeting TICs with ADCs. Strikingly,
efficacy was observed in KRAS wild-type and KRAS mutant
tumors, consistent with the ADC mechanism of action. Future
studies could determine whether the anti-5T4 ADC strategy in
NSCLC might transcend KRAS status, in contrast to anti-EGFR
(epidermal growth factor receptor) therapies (38).
The efficacy of a TIC-directed therapy will likely depend on
the proportion and properties of the targeted TICs. Even if

quiescent or slow-growing TICs are destroyed or differentiated,
tumors with proliferating progenitor-like cells might not
regress in the short term (8); on the other hand, immediate
therapeutic impact might be achieved if we eliminate proliferating TICs that contribute to both pathologic damage and
disease progression. The dramatic, antigen-specific activity of
the anti-5T4 ADC might be explained by the proliferative state
of 5T4hi TICs, but further studies are needed to fully understand
the mechanism, which might also involve a bystander effect
(39) and/or drug-induced 5T4 expression (e.g., as observed in
60274A1 PDX following cisplatin treatment; our unpublished
data). Because of the continuous nature of 5T4 expression that
we observed in some models, we cannot exclude the possibility
that the anti-5T4 ADC might target both TICs and non-TICs in
some tumors, which would be therapeutically advantageous.
In summary, our study delineates a cellular hierarchy in
NSCLC, characterizes the undifferentiated highly tumorigenic
cell subpopulation, and shows the application of this knowledge to the development of anticancer therapeutics. Characterization of 5T4 as a TIC marker in NSCLC suggests an
explanation for the long-term efficacy of the anti-5T4 ADC
despite heterogeneous 5T4 expression in the tumors. Future
studies could uncover additional molecules that, even if
expressed in only a subpopulation of cells in the tumor,
constitute appealing therapeutic targets against aggressive
heterogeneous diseases.
