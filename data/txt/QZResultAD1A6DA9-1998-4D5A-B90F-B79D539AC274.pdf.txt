Abstract
Approximately 25% of breast cancers do not express the estrogen receptor-a (ERa) and consequently do not
respond to endocrine therapy. In these tumors, ERa repression is often due to epigenetic modifications such as
methylation and histone deacetylation. For this reason, we investigated the ability of the histone deacetylase
inhibitor entinostat (ENT) to trigger reexpression of ERa and aromatase in breast cancer cells, with the notion
that this treatment would restore sensitivity to the aromatase inhibitor (AI) letrozole. ENT treatment of tumor
cells increased expression of ERa and aromatase, along with the enzymatic activity of aromatase, in a dosedependent manner both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, ERa and aromatase upregulation resulted in sensitization
of breast cancer cells to estrogen and letrozole. Tumor growth rate was significantly lower in tumor xenografts
following treatment with ENT alone and in combination with letrozole than in control tumors (P > 0.001). ENT
plus letrozole also prevented lung colonization and growth of tumor cells, with a significant reduction (P > 0.03)
in both visible and microscopic foci. Our results show that ENT treatment can be used to restore the letrozole
responsiveness of ER-negative tumors. More generally, they provide a strong rationale for immediate clinical
evaluation of combinations of histone deacetylase and aromatase inhibitors to treat ER-negative and endocrineresistant breast cancers. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1893–903. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
The knowledge that estrogens play a critical role in growth
of hormone-dependent breast cancer is exploited in the use of
endocrine therapy such as antiestrogens (AE) and aromatase
inhibitors (AI). The development of AIs has led to significant
improvements in the treatment of hormone receptor–positive
breast cancer in postmenopausal women (1, 2). However,
endocrine therapy is limited to patients whose tumors express
hormone receptors, namely, the estrogen receptor-a (ERa)
and/or the progesterone receptor (PgR). About 25% of breast
cancers lack the expression of both hormone receptors and
are considered hormone-independent. Systemic therapy for
these patients has traditionally been limited to only cytotoxic

chemotherapy. Thus, there is a critical need to improve
treatment of these women.
Previous reports have suggested that lack of ERa expression
in ER-negative breast cancers is due to epigenetic changes,
such as increased deacetylation and methylation (3). Histone
acetylation and deacetylation are key epigenetic processes
that affect gene regulation by changing the DNA conformation
in the chromatin. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) is an enzyme
that regulates acetylation of histone protein. Recent studies
indicate that silencing of a gene by methylation involves the
generation of an inactive chromatin structure characterized
by deacetylated histones (4). For example, deacetylation of
histones results in chromatin condensation, which, in turn,
causes transcriptional repression of gene expression (4). CpG
island of the ERa gene is extensively methylated in ERnegative breast cancer cells (5) and in about 50% of the
primary ER-negative breast tumors but remains unmethylated
in normal breast tissue and many ERa-positive tumors and
cell lines (5). The relevance of this finding was showed when
ER-negative human breast cancer cells were treated with
demethylating agent 5-azacytidine. This led to reactivation
of ERa mRNA and functional ERa protein (6). Studies have
shown that repression of ERa can also be reversed by the use
of HDAC inhibitors (HDACi; ref. 6). HDACis such as butyric
acid (BA) or trichostatin A reverse the repression by specific
inhibition of HDAC activity, leading to histone hyperacetylation, chromatin relaxation, and enhanced transcription. However, this strategy remains to be tested in preclinical in vivo
models of breast cancer.

Sabnis et al.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that inhibiting HDAC
in ER-negative tumors will increase expression of functional
ERa and aromatase. Thus, tumor cells with silenced ERa
expression would be rendered responsive to growth inhibition
by AIs. To test our premise, we used the HDAC inhibitor
entinostat (ENT/ENT-275/SNDX-275), an oral class I selective
HDACi, and the AI letrozole. Our results showed that treatment with ENT resulted in upregulation of ERa and aromatase expression, with consequent inhibition of growth by
letrozole of tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. This strategy of
converting ER-negative tumors to ER-positive tumors, using
HDACis, could provide a new avenue for management of
patients with ER-negative breast cancer.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
ERa-negative MDA-MB-231, Hs578T, and SKBR3 cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
These cell lines were authenticated by ATCC, using short
tandem repeat profiling, karyotyping, and by monitoring cell
morphology. In vitro assay conditions and data analysis are
described in the Supplementary Methods section.
Subcutaneous tumor analysis
All animal studies were conducted according to the guidelines and approval of the Animal Care Committee of the
University of Maryland, Baltimore. Tumor xenografts of
MDA-MB-231 cells inoculated into each flank of the female
ovariectomized (OVX), athymic nude mouse as previously
described with minor modifications (7–12). Treatment
details are provided in the Supplementary Methods section.
Tumor volumes were calculated from the formula 4/3pr12r2,
where r1 < r2.
Lung colonization assay
Mice received injections of 3  106 MDA-MB-231 cells via
the tail vein. Groups of mice were treated 3 weeks later with
vehicle (control), ENT, letrozole, or ENT plus letrozole. Mice
were treated for 6 weeks and then euthanized.
Western blotting
Cell lysates were prepared as described previously (7–11, 13)
and 50 mg of protein from each sample was analyzed by SDSPAGE. The densitometric values were corrected using b-actin
as a loading control. Details of antibodies used are described
in the Supplementary Methods section.
Aromatase activity
Aromatase activity in cells was determined using a radiometric assay by measuring 3H2O formed on conversion of [1b3H]androstene3,17-dione (D4A; aromatase substrate) to
estrone (7, 14).
RNA extraction and reverse transcriptase PCR
RNA was extracted and purified using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen) as per manufacturer's protocol. The analysis of ERa,
CYP-19 (aromatase), and pS2 mRNA expression was carried

1894

Cancer Res; 71(5) March 1, 2011

out by conventional reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) as
described earlier (8, 15).
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was done on formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded tissue (5-mm sections). The primary antibodies used were ERa and Ki67.
Statistics
For in vitro studies, statistical analysis was done on InStat
3.0 for Mac (GraphPad Software Inc.) One-way ANOVA was
used for multiple comparisons with the Tukey test. However, if
the data did not pass the normality test, then a nonparametric
test was used such as Kruskal–Wallis analysis with Dunn
posttest. For in vivo studies, mixed-effects models were used.
The tumor volumes were analyzed with S-PLUS (version 7.0;
Insightful Corp.) to estimate and compare an exponential
parameter (bi) controlling the growth rate for each treatment
groups. The original values for tumor volumes were log
transformed. All P < 0.05 values were considered statistically
significant. The graphs are represented as mean  SEM.

Results
The HDACi ENT induces ERa and aromatase expression
in ER-negative breast cancer cells in vitro
Expression of ERa protein was undetectable in MDA-MB231 cells by Western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 1) and no
significant binding of 17b-estradiol (E2) occurred without ENT
treatment (data not shown). In addition, growth of MDA-MB231 cells was not inhibited by AEs or AIs, nor stimulated by
estrogen (data not shown). Expression of ERa protein was
upregulated 8- and 9.9-fold after treatment with 10 nmol/L of
ENT and SAHA, respectively, and expression of aromatase was
upregulated 2.6- and 1.8-fold with ENT and SAHA, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. 1). Treatment with ENT resulted in upregulation of ERa and aromatase mRNA in a time-dependent
manner; an increase was observed in as early as 15 minutes
(Fig. 1A). The effect of the 2 HDACis was similar in other ERnegative cell lines, SKBr3 and Hs578T (data not shown). However, ENT was more effective in induction of both ERa and
aromatase and was therefore selected for further study.
To show that ERa was functional, a competitive binding
study was conducted to quantitate the ERa in MDA-MB-231
cells with or without pretreatment with ENT. In the absence of
ENT treatment, E2 did not bind to the ER. When pretreated
with 1 mmol/L of ENT for 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. 2),
receptor sites occupied by E2 were 1,123 fmoles/mg of protein
(Bmax).
Next, we evaluated the effect of ENT on estrogen signaling.
ENT treatment alone did not change the mRNA levels of pS2,
an ERa-induced gene. However, when ENT was followed by
treatment with estrogen or D4A for 3 hours, pS2 and PgR
expression was significantly enhanced (Fig. 1B). These results
indicated that while functional ERa protein is expressed with
ENT treatment, activation by estrogen is necessary for gene
transcription. Furthermore, enhanced transcription of pS2
could be inhibited by letrozole (Fig. 1B).

Mechanism of upregulation of aromatase
In vitro chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was
used to determine whether the aromatase gene was activated in ERa-dependent or -independent manner. MDA-MB231 cells were treated with or without ENT for 24 hours,
followed by E2/D4A/letrozole for 3 hours. The cells were fixed
and chromatin fragments were precipitated with acetyl
histone H3 (Fig. 2A) or ERa antibody (Fig. 2B). Total histone
H3 (Fig. 2C) served as a positive control and no antibody was
included in the negative control (Fig. 2D). Treatment with
ENT induced transcriptional activation of aromatase promoter, as evidenced by increased recruitment of acetyl
histone H3. This recruitment was not affected by treatment
with E2, D4A, or letrozole. In addition, ERa was not recruited
at the aromatase promoter; consistent with this finding that
blocking ER with ER downregulator did not affect the ENTinduced increase in aromatase. These results suggest that
ENT activates aromatase in an ERa-independent and ligandindependent manner.

The basal level of aromatase activity in MDA-MB-231 cells
was 5.83  1.1 fmoles/mg protein/h. When cells were treated
with ENT (1 mmol/L) for 24 hours and then incubated with
[1b-3H]D4A for 18 hours, aromatase activity was increased to
87  4.4 fmoles/mg protein/h (Fig. 1C). This increase in
aromatase activity was dose dependent (data not shown)
and showed an increase in functional enzyme. Treatment
of MDA-MB-231 cells with SAHA (1 mmol/L for 18 hours)
also increased aromatase activity (data not shown), which
could then be inhibited by letrozole (1 mmol/L). This increase
in aromatase was not dependent on ERa. When cells were
pretreated with the ERa downregulator fulvestrant along with
ENT, the increase in the aromatase caused by ENT was not
affected (Fig. 1C). Thus, these results clearly provided evidence
of reexpression of both functional ERa and aromatase following ENT treatment.
As expected, the proliferation of ER-negative MDA-MB231 cells was not affected by letrozole treatment alone.
However, when combined with ENT or SAHA (100 nmol/
L), letrozole inhibited cell growth in a dose-dependent
manner (IC50 ¼ 6.17 nmol/L; Fig. 1D). Inhibitory effects
similar to those observed with letrozole were also seen on
combining ENT with other AIs such as anastrozole and
exemestane (data not shown).
Although cell growth was inhibited by the HDACi ENT
(IC50 ¼ 85.4 nmol/L) in a steroid-depleted medium, in the
presence of E2 or D4A, cell growth was stimulated (IC50 ¼ 2.8
mmol/L) because of activation of ERa when the ligand was
provided. This counteracted the growth inhibition effect of
ENT alone. Thus, the dose–response curve shifted to the
right on addition of D4A (10 nmol/L) to the treatment
medium (Fig. 1E). Growth stimulation was also seen when
MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with ENT for 3 days and
then treated with D4A at various concentrations. D4A caused
mitogenic effects, suggesting that the estrogen produced by
aromatase counteracted the inhibition due to ENT alone. A
similar growth pattern is seen with ER-positive MCF-7Ca
cells and D4A (Fig. 1F; refs. 8, 13).

The HDACi ENT converts ERa-negative breast cancers
to ERa-positive tumors in vivo
In the first experiment, mice bearing ER-negative MDA-MB231 tumors (n ¼ 5) were treated with vehicle (control) or 4
doses of ENT (1, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg/d) orally. Tumors grew slowly
in the first 5 weeks of ENT treatment but rapidly thereafter
(Fig. 3A). The mean tumor weight of the mice treated with 2.5
mg/kg/d of ENT was significantly lower than vehicle control (P
< 0.05; Fig. 3B). Although mean volumes were reduced at other
doses, due to the variation in the tumor weights, the values of
the mean tumor weights were not significantly different from
control. Because the mouse uterus is extremely sensitive to
estrogen stimulation, changes in uterine weight are useful in
monitoring estrogen effects in vivo (16–18). As previously
shown, AIs block estrogen production and reduce uterine
weight (19–23). Although ENT at 2.5 mg/kg/d inhibited tumor
growth, it had no effect on the estrogen-sensitive mouse
uterus (Fig. 3B).
The tumors collected at the end of treatment were analyzed
for treatment-induced changes in target gene expression.
Western blotting analysis of tumor lysates showed that treatment with ENT resulted in a dose-dependent increase in ERa
and aromatase protein levels (Fig. 3C) and activity (Fig. 3D).
RT-PCR confirmed transcriptional upregulation of ERa and
aromatase mRNA in ENT-treated tumors (Fig. 3E).
In a second experiment, groups of MDA-MB-231 tumorbearing mice were treated with ENT alone, supplemented with
D4A, or administered both ENT and D4A (Fig. 4A). The
differences in the tumor growth rate and tumor weights
among the groups were not statistically significant, although
values for the ENT group tended to be lower (Fig. 4A and B).
However, when D4A, which is converted to E2 by aromatase,
was combined with ENT tumor growth was less inhibited. This
may be explained by E2 activating ERa and stimulating the

tumor growth. This increased growth effect is clearly seen in
the estrogen-sensitive uteri of animals given ENT plus D4A
(Fig. 4B) compared with those of control mice (P < 0.01) and
those treated with ENT alone (P < 0.05). Thus, although ENT
alone increases ER and aromatase activity, there was no
evidence of stimulatory effects on the uteri of these animals
but only on the uteri of mice receiving ENT and the estrogen
precursor D4A (Fig. 4B).
In tumors, the mRNA levels of estrogen-regulated genes pS2
and PgR were higher in those treated with ENT plus D4A
(Fig. 4C). These results strongly support our findings that
protein levels of ERa and aromatase in the tumors were
upregulated by ENT (Fig. 3C and E). Activation of ERa by
estrogen (converted from D4A) induced transcription of pS2
and PgR. Consistent with these results, treatment with letrozole inhibited transcription of pS2 and PgR (Fig. 4C). Collectively, these results suggest that ENT converted triple-negative
MDA-MB-231 xenografts into ER-positive and hormoneresponsive tumors.
Combining ENT with the AI letrozole inhibits tumor
growth in vivo
Mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts (150 mm3) were

letrozole (10 mg/d), or ENT plus letrozole. Except for the
control group, all the mice received D4A supplement. The
mean tumor volume on day 0 was not statistically different

1898

Cancer Res; 71(5) March 1, 2011

across groups (P ¼ 0.88). As shown in Figure 5A, the ENT plus
letrozole markedly inhibited tumor growth compared with the
control (P ¼ 0.004), ENT (P ¼ 0.009), or letrozole (P ¼ 0.049)
groups. At autopsy (Fig. 5B), the mean tumor weight of mice
treated with ENT plus letrozole was significantly lower than
the control (P < 0.001), ENT, or letrozole groups (P < 0.01).
These results suggest that aromatase activity induced by ENT
was blocked by letrozole, resulting in little or no estrogen
production as confirmed by reduction in uterine weight
(Fig. 5B). This resulted in almost complete inhibition of tumor
growth.
Western blot analysis of the MDA-MB-231 tumors confirmed that in ENT-treated tumors, protein expression of
ERa, PgR, and aromatase was upregulated (Fig. 5C). The
tumors of mice treated with ENT plus letrozole had increased
levels of aromatase protein compared with controls and ERa/
PgR levels were higher than those with letrozole alone.
Furthermore, ENT treatment significantly increased intratumoral aromatase activity in comparison with controls (P <
0.0001), which was markedly inhibited by treatment with ENT
plus letrozole compared with ENT alone (Fig. 5D).
Similar responses were seen in tumors of a second ERnegative cell line, Hs578T (Fig. 6), and in LTLT-Ca cells (refs. 7,
12, 24; Supplementary Fig. 3). Tumors of mice treated with
ENT plus letrozole had significantly smaller tumors (P < 0.001)
than control, ENT plus D4A, and D4A plus letrozole groups
(Fig. 5).

IHC of treated tumors
Histopathologic analysis of hematoxylin and eosin–stained
sections of the MDA-MB-2331 tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4)
revealed a highly necrotic center in the tumors from the ENT
plus letrozole-treated mice, confirming the effectiveness of the
combination treatment on inhibiting the growth of the
tumors. Furthermore, IHC revealed that ERa was expressed
in the epithelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 4). These results
confirmed previous findings that ENT treatment results in
expression of ERa, rendering the MDA-MB-231 cells and

In fact, tumors treated with the combination had fewer cells
that stained positive for the proliferation marker Ki67 than the
control tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4).
Combination of ENT plus letrozole inhibits lung

Figure 6. Effect of ENT with or without letrozole on the growth of Hs578T xenografts: Xenografts of Hs578T cells were grown in OVX female nude mice.
Mice were treated as indicated. Each data point represents volume of 1 tumor. Tumor growth was significantly slower in the tumors of mice treated
with ENT þ letrozole (**, P < 0.01) compared with control, ENT plus D4A, and D4A plus letrozole.

Colonization of cells into the lungs resulted in visible or
microscopic tumor foci (Fig. 7A and B). All 6 of 6 mice in
the control group showed an average of 60 visible metastases
and 15 micrometastases per animal. Five of 6 mice in the ENT
group had visible metastases (25 on average) and micrometastases (13). Three of 6 mice in the letrozole group had
visible metastases (20) and micrometastases (7). In contrast, only 1 of 6 mice treated with ENT plus letrozole showed
1 visible and 2 micrometastases in the lungs. These results
provide strong evidence that the combination of ENT plus
letrozole markedly inhibits growth of tumor foci in the lungs.

Discussion
ERa-negative breast cancers remain difficult to manage and
treatment options are limited to chemotherapy because the

1900

tumors are more aggressive and resistant to endocrine therapy. Genetic alternations such as mutations, LOH, or homozygous deletions are rare (6, 25). Studies conducted by
Davidson and colleagues suggested that the loss of ERa
protein expression is the result of the hypermethylation of
the CpG islands within the ERa promoter (5, 26). Deacetylated
histones were associated with the inactive ERa promoter in
MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas acetylated histones were associated with the active ERa promoter in MCF-7 cells (25).
Treatment with HDACis reversed repression of ERa in MDAMB-231 cells (27). In this article, we show that the HDACi ENT
was effective in causing expression of ERa and aromatase, the
enzyme that is key in the production of estrogen. Targeting the
upregulated aromatase, using letrozole, caused reduced cell
viability in vitro and tumor regression in vivo. Our studies
investigated both biochemical and biological consequences of

Figure 7. Effect of treatment with ENT and letrozole alone or in
combination on colonization of MDA-MB-231 cells in the lungs of mice:
MDA-MB-231 cells were injected into the tail vein. The mice were treated
with after 3 weeks with vehicle, ENT plus D4A, D4A plus letrozole, or
combination, for 6 weeks. Visible or micrometastatic foci were quantitiated
at autopsy. A, the combination of ENT (ENT) plus letrozole produced
significantly fewer visible lung foci than control (*, P ¼ 0.002) and ENT (†, P
¼ 0.02). B, mice treated with a combination of ENT plus letrozole had
significantly fewer micrometastases than control (*, P ¼ 0.0269) and ENT

these treatments and provide a strong rationale for use of AIs
in combination with HDACis for the treatment of ER-negative
breast cancers.
Several studies have now confirmed that gene silencing by
methylation involves generation of inactive chromatin structure, characterized by deacetylated histones (4, 26, 27). The
HDACs deacetylate lysine groups of histones H3 and H4,
allowing ionic interactions between positively charged lysine
residues on histones and negatively charged DNA. This results
in compaction of the nucleosomes, which prevents transcription (3, 4). An endogenous interaction exists between HDAC 1
and ERa in the absence of estrogen in breast cancer cells (28).
HDAC2 and 3 have been indicated to associate with ERa-

www.aacrjournals.org

regulated genes such as c-Myc and cathepsin D (27). ENT was
used in this study because of its specificity for class I HDACs
such as HDAC 1, 2, and 3. ENT also exhibited a long half-life
(100 hours) and favorable pharmacodynamic effects in
humans (29, 30).
Our novel findings show that HDACi ENT can lead to an
increase in functional tumoral aromatase activity and an
increase in ERa-mediated transcription (pS2 upregulation),
both in vitro and in vivo. Our previous study with letrozoleresistant LTLT-Ca cells showed that upregulation of ERa led
to activation of aromatase gene transcription in a liganddependent manner (24). However, in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with ENT, aromatase was upregulated in ERa-independent manner.
Among the 3 HDACis tested, ENT, SAHA, and BA, ENT was
the most potent. These effects were not specific to just one cell
line, MDA-MB-231. In vitro studies with 2 other ERa-negative
cell lines (SKBr-3 and Hs578T) confirmed the results obtained
with MDA-MB-231. On the basis of these findings, we hypothesized that treatment with an HDACi would convert ER-negative tumors to ER-positive tumors, thereby rendering them
sensitive to estrogens and, consequently, the inhibitory effects
of AIs. Treatment of xenografts with MDA-MB-231 (Fig. 5A)
and HS578T tumors (Fig. 6) confirmed this hypothesis. In
initial dose finding studies, reduction in tumor growth was
observed in OVX mice treated with ENT alone (Fig. 3A).
However, when the mice were supplemented with D4A to
produce estrogen, tumor growth was slightly stimulated, thus
negating the inhibitory effect of ENT.
The induction of aromatase in the tumor leads to the
production of estrogen via aromatization of D4A. This results
in the activation of ERa and transcription of ERa-regulated
genes, leading to tumor growth, thereby counteracting the
tumor inhibitory effect of ENT (Figs. 1E and F and 3A). In this
setting, combining the AI letrozole with ENT inhibited production of estrogen. This resulted in inhibition of tumor
growth and lung metastases.
ERa-positive cancer cell lines respond to HDACi differently.
In these cells, in contrast to our findings in ERa-negative cell
lines, Chen and colleagues have shown that the HDACi
LBH589 specifically inhibits aromatase activity and downregulates gene and protein expression through suppression
of promoters I.3/PII (31). SAHA acts in a similar manner in
MCF-7 and BT-474 cells (32). SAHA downregulates ERa
through hyperacetylation of HSP-90, a chaperone protein that
maintains the stability of ERa (32). HDAC6 is HSP90 deacetylase and inhibition of HDAC6 is responsible for HDACimediated HSP90 inhibition (33, 34). This complex regulation of
ERa by HDACi in ER-positive versus ER-negative breast cancer
warrants further investigation. There is also some evidence of
partial restoration of functional ERa in cells that have lost ERa
and PgR expression as a result of acquired resistance to
endocrine therapy (35, 36). In this model system, expression
of PgR could not be restored with reexpression of ERa.
The detailed molecular mechanism of the conversion of
MDA-MB-231 cells from hormone-independent to hormonedependent cells expressing ER and aromatase is unknown at
this time. However, it suggests phenotypic plasticity of the

cells (37, 38) that enables them to adapt (11–13, 24) to
changes in their microenvironment. Further studies are
needed to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying this
phenomenon.
In conclusion, our study using both biological and biochemical assays shows that the HDACi ENT increases both
ERa and aromatase expression and activity, thereby converting ER-negative tumors to ERa-positive tumors. The breast
cells are now sensitive to the growth stimulatory effects of
estrogens synthesized locally by the aromatization of D4A in
the tumor. Thus, when the AI letrozole was combined with the
HDACi, the ERa-expressing tumors were deprived of estrogen.
This resulted in suppression of tumor growth. Furthermore,
the combination treatment was also effective in inhibiting
tumor cell colonization in the lungs. This novel approach
could potentially provide a new treatment strategy for the
management of ERa-negative breast cancer.
