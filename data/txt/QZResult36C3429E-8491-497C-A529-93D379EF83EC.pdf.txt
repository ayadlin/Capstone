Abstract
Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting side effect of many antineoplastic agents, but the mechanisms underlying the toxicities are unclear. At their MTDs, the
microtubule-binding drugs paclitaxel and ixabepilone induce
more severe neuropathy in mice relative to eribulin mesylate,
paralleling their toxicity proﬁles in clinic. We hypothesized that
the severity of their neurotoxic effects might be explained by the
levels at which they accumulate in the peripheral nervous system.
To test this hypothesis, we compared their pharmacokinetics and
distribution in peripheral nerve tissue. After administration of a
single intravenous dose, each drug was rapidly cleared from
plasma but all persisted in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and
sciatic nerve (SN) for up to 72 hours. Focusing on paclitaxel and

eribulin, we performed a 2-week MTD-dosing regimen, followed by a determination of drug pharmacokinetics, tissue
distribution, and multiple functional measures of peripheral
nerve toxicity for 4 weeks. Consistent with the acute dosing
study, both drugs persisted in peripheral nervous tissues for
weeks, in contrast to their rapid clearance from plasma. Notably, although eribulin exhibited greater DRG and SN penetration than paclitaxel, the neurotoxicity observed functionally
was consistently more severe with paclitaxel. Overall, our
results argue that sustained exposure of microtubule-binding
chemotherapeutic agents in peripheral nerve tissues cannot
by itself account for their associated neurotoxicity. Cancer Res;

Introduction

provide an opportunity to explore the relationship between
exposure and toxicity for both existing and new chemotherapies.
For example, we have reported that paclitaxel and ixabepilone
produce more severe neuropathy in mice compared with eribulin
mesylate at their respective MTDs (3), ﬁndings that replicate the
frequency of severe neuropathy reported in comparative clinical
studies (1, 8). However, it is not known whether these differences
are due to the intrinsic toxicity of these agents or due to differences
in exposure of the vulnerable peripheral nervous system.
It has long been recognized that cumulative chemotherapy
dose over time is the most important clinical predictor of
neuropathy. This dependence on dose could either be due to
an accumulation of injury produced by the toxicity of each
administration or an accumulation of drug in peripheral nerve
tissues that reach toxic levels only after multiple doses. Peripheral nervous tissue exposure is difﬁcult to quantitate clinically,
and is likely poorly predicted by plasma concentration because
of variable distribution, often strongly inﬂuenced by factors
such as formulation or route of administration (9–12). In
addition, clearance mechanisms from tissues also varies, determined both by binding of chemotherapeutic agents within
tissues and efﬂux mediated by transport mechanisms such as
P-glycoproteins (13, 14).
To investigate further the potential relationship between peripheral nervous tissue accumulation and neuropathy, it would be useful
to compare chemotherapeutic agents with similar mechanisms
but different neurotoxic potential. In the experiments described

Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a
major clinical problem representing a signiﬁcant dose-limiting
side effect of many antineoplastic drugs. Even when neuropathy is
not dose limiting, residual neuropathy can severely affect quality
of life in cancer survivors. The severity of neuropathy caused by a
particular chemotherapeutic drug is dependent on multiple factors, including mechanism of action, frequency of administration,
duration of treatment, and cumulative dose (1, 2). Within the
class of microtubule-targeting drugs, high-grade neuropathy
occurs more frequently with paclitaxel and epothilones, such as
ixabepilone, whereas eribulin is less likely to produce doselimiting neuropathy. Animal models of CIPN have provided data
that are in broad agreement with clinical results (3–7) and thus

PNS Drug Exposure Does Not Correlate with Neurotoxicity

here, we determined the relationship between plasma pharmacokinetics, peripheral nervous system tissue concentration, and
development of neuropathy using a single administration and a
2-week, MTD model for three microtubule-targeting chemotherapies. We report for the ﬁrst time that all three drugs show dramatic
and sustained accumulation in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and
sciatic nerve (SN), with measureable levels maintained for up to
several weeks after the last dose. However, at least in the case of
paclitaxel and eribulin, the degree of tissue penetration and
accumulation does not correlate with development of
neuropathy.

Materials and Methods
Animals
Female BALB/c mice (approximately 7–8 weeks old at the onset
of dosing) were obtained from Harlan Laboratories and maintained with free access to water and a standardized synthetic diet
(Harlan Teklad). Animal housing and procedure room temperature and humidity were maintained at 20  2 C and 55  10%,
respectively. Artiﬁcial lighting provided a 12-hour light/dark cycle
(light 7 am–7 pm). All experimental protocols were approved by
the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Sobran Inc.
and adhered to all of the applicable institutional and governmental guidelines for the humane treatment of laboratory animals.
Mice were treated with single and multiple doses of a previously
determined 6-dose MTD regimen administered intravenously on
an every other day for three injections with a 2 day rest between
weekly cycles (Q2D3  2 week) schedule (for method, see
ref. 3). MTD was deﬁned as the maximal dose of eribulin mesylate,
ixabepilone, or paclitaxel administered at which no more than
one animal in the treatment group died spontaneously. In addition, this was the maximal dose tested at which no mice in the dose
group required euthanasia due to >20% individual weight loss,
showing overt clinical signs of distress or inability to eat and/or
drink. The MTD when administered intravenously 6 times on a
Q2D3  2-week schedule was found to be 1.125 mg/kg for
eribulin, 2 mg/kg for ixabepilone, and 30 mg/kg for paclitaxel.
Drugs and formulations
Eribulin mesylate [synthesized at Eisai Research Institute (Andover, MA) and stored at 80 C in the dark] was dissolved in 100%
anhydrous DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) to produce a 10 mg/mL stock
solution, which was separated into aliquots and stored at 80 C
until the day of administration. Each administration day, the
stock solution was thawed and diluted with saline to a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.112 mg/mL in 2.5% DMSO/97.5% and
administered in a 10 mL/kg volume.
Paclitaxel (purchased from LC Laboratories and stored at
20 C in the dark) was dissolved in ethanol (100%) at 10% of
ﬁnal volume. An equal volume of cremophor (10% of ﬁnal
volume) was then added and the mixture revortexed for about
10 minutes. Immediately prior to injection, ice-cold saline was
added to ﬁnal volume (as 80% of ﬁnal), and the solution was
maintained on ice during dosing. Dosing solutions of 3 mg/mL
were made fresh daily and administered in a 10 mL/kg volume.
Ixabepilone (Ixempra, Bristol-Myers Squibb), was prepared
according to the package insert. The formulated ixabepilone stock
solution (2 mg/mL) was immediately aliquoted and stored at
80 C until use. On each experimental day, the stock solution
was diluted by adding 50% ethanol/50% cremophor, with sub-

www.aacrjournals.org

sequent vortexing to yield a resultant solution that was 5 times the
required dosing concentration. Finally, 4 volumes of PBS were
added, while vortexing, to achieve a ﬁnal dosing concentration of
10 mL/kg.
Pharmacokinetic studies
Pharmacokinetic studies were performed in female BALB/c mice
to determine the plasma, DRG, and SN exposure of eribulin and
paclitaxel after single and multiple MTD administrations as
described above. For the single dose pharmacokinetics, plasma
and tissue were taken at the following time points: time zero (no
treatment), 0.25, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 24, 72 hours, and 7 days after drug
administration. For pharmacokinetics following multiple doses,
plasma and tissues were taken at the following time points during/
after the Q2Dx3  2-week 6-dose administrations: 1 hour before
third, fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth dose and then 24 hours, 7, and 14 days
following the last (sixth) dose. At sacriﬁce, blood was removed via
cardiac puncture. Plasma was derived from the whole blood by
centrifugation at 3,000 rpm at 4 C in plasma separator tubes for 10
minutes. The SN and DRG were removed and pooled from 3 mice
per time point and homogenized with 3 times their respective
weights of mouse plasma using a MiniBead Beater-96. All samples
were stored at 80 C until subsequent analysis. Samples were
analyzed for eribulin, ixabepilone, and paclitaxel using reversed
phase chromatography on a LC/MS-MS (API-4000 with a Shimadzu autosampler) using methods based on procedures
described previously (15–17). The lower limits of quantiﬁcations
were 0.5, 2, and 10 ng/mL in plasma and 5, 10, and 50 ng/g in DRG,
for eribulin, paclitaxel, and ixabepilone, respectively, and 8mg/g for
each analyte in SN. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated
using noncompartmental analysis in WinNonLin v 5.0.3.
Electrophysiology
Electrophysiologic measurements were performed as described
previously (3, 18). In brief, baseline caudal and digital nerve
conduction velocities (NCV) and amplitudes were measured in all
mice one week prior to initiation of dosing. Mice were anesthetized with 2% isoﬂurane (by inhalation, for induction and maintenance) and placed on a heating pad with rectal temperature
monitored and maintained between 37.0 C to 40.0 C. Platinum
subdermal needle electrodes (Grass Technologies) were used.
Caudal NCV was recorded from electrodes in a bipolar conﬁguration at the base of the tail (at the hairline); the stimulating
cathode being positioned 35 mm further distal. Digital NCV was
recorded using stimulation at the base of the second toe and
recording at the level of the lateral malleolus. Amplitudes were
measured as the baseline to peak neural response. Each nerve
segment stimulation was repeated at least 3 times, up to a
maximum of 6 times, with increasing voltage until the maximal
response was achieved, using AcqKnowledge software version
3.7.3 (BIOPAC Systems Inc.). Mice were assigned into a vehicle,
paclitaxel, or eribulin treatment group (10 mice/group). Following MTD dosing on a Q2Dx3 for 2-week schedule, mice were again
tested for NCV at 24 hours, 7, and 14 days following the last dose.

Results
Pharmacokinetic studies
Following intravenous administration, plasma concentrations
of eribulin, paclitaxel, and ixabepilone declined rapidly, presumably due to rapid distribution to peripheral compartments

Electrophysiology
Following the 2-week MTD dosing regimen, caudal nerve
conduction velocity was signiﬁcantly slowed by paclitaxel at every
time point measured (ranging from 23%–38% of vehicle;
Fig. 3A). Similarly, caudal amplitude was signiﬁcantly reduced
by paclitaxel administration, remaining suppressed by 77  4%
(mean  SEM) at 28 days after ﬁrst dosing (Fig. 3B). Digital nerve
conduction velocity also showed signiﬁcant deﬁcits at every time
point measured (between 10% and 25% of vehicle; Fig. 3C).
Paclitaxel also signiﬁcantly affected digital nerve amplitude at all
time points, remaining suppressed by 53  7.8% at 28 days after
dosing (Fig. 3D). Overall, the pattern of deﬁcit was present the ﬁrst
day following dosing, showing a trend toward recovery for the
conduction velocity measurements but mild gradual worsening
for the sensory nerve amplitude measures. These patterns did not
appear to be related to the prolonged tissue exposure.
In contrast, eribulin had no signiﬁcant effect on caudal velocity
at any time point tested, although a nonsigniﬁcant deﬁcit (ranging
between 7% and 17%) was consistently observed (Fig. 4A).
Eribulin-treated mice showed a less severe, but statistically
signiﬁcant suppression of caudal amplitude at 14 and 28 days
following the last dose (30  9.8 and 52  5.0%, respectively; Fig.
4B). Similarly, eribulin produced small but signiﬁcant deﬁcits in
digital nerve velocity from 7 days postdose, ranging from 8% to
12% of vehicle (Fig. 4C). Digital amplitude in eribulin-treated

(19–21). Limitations of assay sensitivity prevented characterization of terminal elimination. After a single infusion, all three
drugs rapidly distributed into DRG and SN, remaining above the
limit of detection for over 72 hours. Concentration–time analyses of eribulin, paclitaxel, and ixabepilone in their respective
matrices after single dose are depicted in Fig. 1A–C.
As shown by the pharmacokinetic parameters (Table 1), the
three drugs varied widely in relative penetration into tissue after
intravenous administration. Accumulation during the early tissue
distribution, reﬂected as maximal exposure (Cmax) reached in
tissue compared with plasma, was greatest for ixabepilone followed by eribulin. Peak paclitaxel concentration in tissue was
lower than peak plasma concentration, whereas eribulin and
ixabepilone displayed greater Cmax in tissue than in plasma. Peak
exposure was greater in DRG than SN for all three compounds.
The overall DRG and SN exposures relative to plasma were
characterized by calculating a tissue penetration index for both
Cmax and AUC. As shown in Table 1, the relative exposure by either
measure was greater in DRG than SN for all three drugs, with
ixabepilone having the highest exposure, eribulin being intermediate, and paclitaxel relatively lower.
As CIPN develops in the mouse model only after repeated
administration, the tissue exposure was subsequently examined
following a multiple MTD dosing paradigm of eribulin and
paclitaxel (Fig. 2A and B, respectively). Similar to observations
after acute dosing, the chemotherapies rapidly entered SN and
DRG from plasma. In all cases, plasma concentrations declined
within 24 hours of last dosing and were not detectable thereafter.
In contrast, concentrations of eribulin and paclitaxel were maintained in SN and DRG for up to 26 days after the completion of
dosing (Fig. 2A and B). As shown in Fig. 2, paclitaxel exposure
reached maximal levels in the DRG after the ﬁrst dose, while in the
SN, there was accumulation with multiple doses. Eribulin exposure showed increasing accumulation in both DRG and SN with
multiple administrations.

exposure was no longer detectable.

Discussion
After a single intravenous dose, paclitaxel, ixabepilone, and
eribulin cleared rapidly from plasma but accumulated and
dramatically persisted in DRG and SN, with limited clearance
three days postadministration. In repeated dose studies, eribulin and paclitaxel also rapidly declined in plasma but accumulated and persisted in peripheral nervous tissues for up to
26 days after dosing. This neurotoxic class of drugs appears to
exert toxic effects directly through prolonged exposure within
sensitive tissues. However, although eribulin consistently
showed greater tissue penetration than paclitaxel, neurotoxicity was minimal and less severe than with paclitaxel. This is in
concordance with the milder morphologic deﬁcits induced by
eribulin in this paradigm compared with paclitaxel reported
previously (3). Together, these data suggest that dramatic and
sustained exposure of chemotherapeutic agents in peripheral
nerve tissues alone cannot account for their neurotoxicity
proﬁles.
The paclitaxel concentrations we observed in DRG using a 2week, MTD model of paclitaxel-induced neuropathy are signiﬁ-

cantly higher than those previously reported by Cavaletti and
colleagues (22) and Xiao and colleagues (4), both performed in
rats. Cavaletti reported a mean tissue concentration in DRG of 366
ng/g after 5 mg/kg/day i.v. on 5 alternating days. Xiao and
colleagues reported concentrations of 446 ng/g 24 hours after 7
days of administration (2 mg/kg i.p. on 4 alternate days) with no
morphologic deﬁcits, whereas in our current study, we observed
4,000 ng/g 24 hours after 6 injections of 30 mg/kg i.v. (Q2Dx3 for
2 weeks), a concentration that also induced morphologic deﬁcits
in our earlier study (3). Differences in paclitaxel administration
route as well as cumulative dose may underlie these reported
differences. Also, given the reported higher paclitaxel exposures
from a cremophor formulation (23) versus ethanol/tween formulation (4), some accumulation in tissue may occur due to the
depot effect of the formulation (24, 25). In addition to the higher
DRG concentration, we observed a concentration in SN that was
approximately 50% of that measured in DRG, whereas Xiao and
colleagues reported SN concentrations only 10% of that measured
in DRG. This is consistent with our observation that paclitaxel
accumulates in SN with repeated doses. Interestingly, in the weeks
after administration, the tissue concentration of paclitaxel in SN
was actually higher than that in DRG, reversing the relative tissue
concentration during the period of administration. This pattern of
gradual accumulation in nerve might explain why a cumulative
dose of paclitaxel is the critical clinical metric for neuropathy risk

(26) if nerve rather than DRG exposure in vulnerable patients is
responsible for toxicity. Correlation in actual clinical samples
would be needed to further explore this relationship.
The pharmacokinetics observed in these experiments can be
understood as the sum of three dynamic processes: (i) distribution of drug into tissue; (ii) retention of drug in tissue, likely at
speciﬁc binding sites; and (iii) efﬂux from tissue by active transport. Regarding uptake into tissues, paclitaxel, eribulin, and
ixabepilone all exhibited a similar pattern of rapid peripheral
nerve tissue distribution, even though they each differ in lipophilicity and formulation. Tissue distribution of these drugs is
complex and can depend on formulation. For example, the
distribution of paclitaxel in cremophor differs substantially from
albumin-bound paclitaxel pharmacokinetics (9, 27). Tissue distribution is not purely passive; active uptake into tumors by
carriers (28) such as OATP1B-mediated transport (11, 29) has
been described. However, the cellular pharmacokinetics and
speciﬁc transport mechanisms of these drugs in cultured peripheral neurons or glial cells are completely unexplored. Such studies
are warranted to elucidate the potential for unique accumulation
and retention of microtubule-targeting chemotherapies in peripheral neural cells versus tumor cells.

3336 Cancer Res; 76(11) June 1, 2016

The sustained retention of all three drugs in DRG and SN is
most likely due to a combination of intracellular binding and lack
of efﬂux mechanisms. Complex computational models of intracellular pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel have been developed
in vitro using cell lines (23, 30, 31) in which intracellular target
binding is a critical factor in the absence of active efﬂux mechanisms because of the high concentration of their binding target,
microtubules. Although the binding sites of paclitaxel and eribulin on microtubules vary (32, 33), as do their effects on microtubule function (34, 35), their afﬁnity and the density of binding
sites appear to be sufﬁcient to result in prolonged intracellular
DRG and SN retention.
Cellular efﬂux mechanisms, if present, appear to be insufﬁcient
to overcome retention through target binding. Although extensive
work has been completed to understand how efﬂux through Pglycoproteins affects exposure of chemotherapeutics in solid
tumors (36, 37), little is known regarding efﬂux mechanisms in
peripheral nervous system tissue. It is known that paclitaxel and
ixabepilone do not achieve high levels of exposures in the brain in
patients (19, 38), but this is presumed due to active efﬂux by
P-glycoproteins across the blood brain barrier, not lack of CNS
distribution (14, 39, 40). Although the efﬂux transporters found

Figure 4.
A–D, mice receiving a 2-week MTD dosing regimen of eribulin mesylate (Q2Dx3 dosing of 1.125 mg/kg i.v. for 2 weeks) exhibited signiﬁcant deﬁcits in
caudal and digital nerve conduction velocity and amplitude. Mean  SEM values at each time point. Black, vehicle; gray, eribulin mesylate.  , P  0.05;

in the blood brain barrier have been found in blood vessels in
peripheral nerve (41, 42), the DRGs appear to exist outside the
blood brain barrier and thus are exposed to greater plasma
components (43), possibly leading to the observed rapid accumulation and retention. We are not aware of in vitro studies of
intracellular binding and efﬂux of these microtubule-binding
drugs in cultured neurons or DRGs. Such studies might illuminate
mechanisms of peripheral nervous system vulnerability to toxicity
and development of better-tolerated agents.
Even though persistent levels of the chemotherapies were
achieved in the mice peripheral nervous system, the results do
not provide a pharmacokinetic explanation for the relative neurotoxicity of these agents. The more subtle functional and pathologic changes produced by eribulin compared with paclitaxel
and ixabepilone are not predicted by relative exposure, accumulation, or retention in peripheral nervous system tissues. Although
tissue accumulation may be necessary to produce the profound
neurotoxicity of paclitaxel and ixabepilone, differential interaction with microtubules must explain differences in neurotoxicity.
Eribulin may have less neurotoxic potential because it primarily
affects microtubule growth in contrast to paclitaxel and ixabepilone, which affect microtubule function more broadly (34, 44).
Differences in microtubule-binding properties may have signif-

icant effects on the toxicity proﬁle of each microtubule-targeting
agent (45, 46). In this context, eribulin mesylate has a 10-fold
lower afﬁnity for microtubule sides than its positive ends (47),
possibly resulting in a lesser disruption of axonal transport of
essential molecules, which may be the underlying reason for its
lower propensity to induce neuropathy (48). In addition to the
functional and pharmacokinetic ﬁndings reported, we recently
showed differential effects of paclitaxel and eribulin on a-tubulin
expression, tubulin acetylation, and EB1 abundance in the peripheral nerve following acute dosing (44) and are currently investigating the longitudinal course of these effects. This type of
comparative study may prove useful in the design of more potent
chemotherapeutic agents with less neurotoxicity. In conclusion,
the dramatic and sustained exposure of chemotherapeutic agents
in peripheral nervous tissue itself cannot account for their ensuing
neurotoxicity proﬁles, and other factors must be implicated.
