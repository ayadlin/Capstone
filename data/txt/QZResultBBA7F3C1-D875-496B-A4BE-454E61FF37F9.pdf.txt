ABSTRACT:
The retinoid-responsive gene CXXC5 localizes to the 5q31.2 chromosomal region
and encodes a retinoid-inducible nuclear factor (RINF) that seems important during
normal myelopoiesis. We investigated CXXC5/RINF expression in primary human
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells derived from 594 patients, and a wide variation in
CXXC5/RINF mRNA levels was observed both in the immature leukemic myeloblasts
and in immature acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. Furthermore, patients with lowrisk cytogenetic abnormalities showed significantly lower levels compared to patients
with high-risk abnormalities, and high RINF/CXXC5/ mRNA levels were associated
with decreased overall survival for patients receiving intensive chemotherapy
for newly diagnosed AML. This association with prognosis was seen both when
investigating (i) an unselected patient population as well as for patients with (ii)
normal cytogenetic and (iii) core-binding factor AML. CXXC5/RINF knockdown in AML
cell lines caused increased susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, and
regulation of apoptosis also seemed to differ between primary human AML cells with
high and low RINF expression. The association with adverse prognosis together with
the antiapoptotic effect of CXXC5/RINF suggests that targeting of CXXC5/RINF should
be considered as a possible therapeutic strategy, especially in high-risk patients who
show increased expression in AML cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells.

INTRODUCTION

29-951). Neutrophil differentiation was not associated
with altered RINF expression, whereas monocytic
differentiation was associated with decreased RINF
mRNA levels (Mann-Whitney test, p=0.0472) compared
with AML cells showing minimal differentiation. Finally,
we did not observe any association between RINF
expression and surface expression of the CD34 stem cell
marker.
We compared RINF expression for patients with
low- (median 243, variation range 87-357), intermediate(794, 29-1189), high-risk (434, 29-951) and normal
cytogenetics (404, 89-1289). The difference between
high- and low-risk cytogenetics then reached a borderline
significance (Mann-Whitney’s test, p=0.0475), whereas
no statistically significant differences were detected
when comparing the other groups. Finally, the presence
of high-risk Flt3 internal tandem duplications (Flt3-ITD)
or low-risk Nucleophosmin (NPM) -1 mutations showed
no associations with RINF expression in this Norwegian
cohort (data not shown), whereas analysis by Q-RT-PCR
in 40 unselected patients showed a significant correlation
between RINF and WT1 expression (Spearman’s
correlation test, ρ=0.661, p=0.00001).
We also analyzed the French AML patient cohorts;
highly enriched AML blasts were then derived from the
bone marrow of 20 patients. Analysis of these patients
confirmed that RINF expression shows a wide variation
in primary human AML cells and this was similar to AML
blasts derived from peripheral blood both when compared
with the Norwegian patients (Fig. 1) and 20 French
patients (median RINF expression 369).

We have recently identified a novel retinoidresponsive gene (CXXC5) that encodes a retinoidinducible nuclear factor (RINF), and expression studies
as well as gene silencing experiments suggest that RINF
is important in normal myelopoiesis [1]. The RINF gene
localizes to the 5q31.2 chromosomal region that can be
involved in chromosomal abnormalities associated with
various myeloid malignancies, including the low-risk 5qvariant of human myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) [1,
2] and the high-risk del5 and -5 abnormalities in human
acute myeloid leukemia (AML) [3].
AML is an aggressive malignancy characterized
by bone marrow infiltration of immature leukemic
myeloblasts [3, 4]. However, it is a very heterogeneous
disease both with regard to leukemogenesis (i.e.
AML-associated genetic abnormalities) as well as the
chemosensitivity and thereby the risk of relapse [3, 5].
On the other hand, RINF seems to be an important early
regulator of normal myelopoiesis [1]. In the present study
we therefore investigated the expression of RINF in nonpromyelocytic variants of AML. We observed a wide
variation of RINF expression in primary human AML cells
and an association between high expression and decreased
overall survival, and RINF seems to mediate antiapoptotic
effects. Taken together, these observations suggest that
RINF should be considered as a possible therapeutic
target in human AML, but whether RINF expression in
addition is an independent prognostic parameter cannot
be judged from the present data and will require further
clinical studies.

We investigated RINF expression in normal
mononuclear bone marrow cells derived from 12
healthy individuals (bone marrow mononuclear cells)
and in CD34+ bone marrow cells (n=11). The median
expression in these bone marrow cells were 152.2 and 497,
respectively.

CXXC5/RINF expression by primary human
AML cells shows a wide variation
We analyzed RINF expression for 59 unselected
Norwegian AML patients (Table 1). The expression
showed a wide variation between patients (Fig. 1) without
any significant correlations to age or gender. Samples
derived from patients with de novo AML showed a slight
but significant decrease of the RINF levels compared
to patients with relapsed or secondary AML (MannWhitney’s test, p<0.05). A similar median level and
variation range was also seen for ALL blasts derived from
14 patients (Fig. 1).
The French-American-British (FAB) classification
was used to compare RINF expression for AML cells
with minimal differentiation (FAB-M0/M1; median
level 517, variation range 101-950) with neutrophil
(FAB-M2; median 474 and range 193-1477) or monocytic
differentiation (FAB-M4/M5; median 334 and range

Mutations of the CXXC5/RINF gene are
uncommon in AML
We first investigated RINF gene status in primary
AML samples from 43 unselected Norwegian patients
(Table 1). For these patients no mutation was detected in
the coding region of the RINF gene when we performed
a complete sequence analysis of the Coding DNA
Sequence (data not shown). Two silent Single Nucleotide
Polymorphisms rs3756677(C>T) and rs356445 (G>A),
were found in exon 3 of the RINF gene for 3 patients. The
first SNP is located in the 5’UTR while the second is a
synonymous SNP (Ala126>Ala126) located in the open

We investigated a cohort of consecutive Norwegian
patients including relapse patients (Table 1); the median
age was relatively high (64 years) (Table 1) and several
patients were therefore regarded as unfit for intensive
chemotherapy. For these reasons, only 27 of these
patients received intensive induction chemotherapy
with cytarabine plus an anthracycline followed by 3 or
4 consolidation cycles with intensive chemotherapy for
newly diagnosed leukemia (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig.
1 and Supplementary Table 1). The 9 patients with the
highest RINF expression in the AML cells then showed a

significantly decreased overall survival compared with the
groups with intermediate or low RINF levels (p=0.012).
A significant association between overall survival after
chemotherapy and RINF expression in the marrowderived AML cells was also observed for the 20 French
patients (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table
2; p=0.037).
We analyzed the association between RINF
expression and overall survival for patients included
in three different clinical studies. Firstly, the study
by Metzeler KH et al. [6] included 163 patients with
normal cytogenetics and again we observed a significant
association between RINF expression and survival;
high levels were associated with an adverse prognosis
and decreased overall survival (Fig. 2). Secondly, we
analyzed 87 patients with core-binding factor AML
published by Bullinger L et al. [7] and we observed
significant associations between overall survival and RINF
expression both when analyzing the overall results (Fig. 2)
and when patients with inv(16) and t(8;21) were analyzed
separately. In contrast to the two previous cohorts patients
with intermediate levels showed a survival curve close
to the patients with high levels, and for this reason they
were analyzed together. The association was strongest for
inv(16) (data not shown). Finally, an association between
RINF level and survival was also seen for the study by
Gaidzik VI et al. [8]. This last study included mainly
Unselected AML

CXXC5/RINF silencing sensitizes AML cells to
chemotherapy
To further investigate whether RINF contributes
to the chemoresistant phenotype of high-risk patients
we investigated the effect of RINF knockdown on the
susceptibility of five different immature myeloid leukemic
cell lines to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, including
K562, MV4-11, OCI-AML3, NB4 and HL60. The highest
RINF mRNA levels were observed for K562 and MV4-11
cells, and these cells showed an increased susceptibility to
drug-induced apoptosis after RINF silencing. The results
for K562 are presented in detail in Fig. 3. An efficient
knock-down of RINF at the protein level was documented
(Fig. 3A), but the in vitro proliferation was not altered
(Fig. 3B) and apoptosis was minimal during in vitro
culture in the absence of chemotherapy (Fig. 3C, left).

Figure 2: High RINF mRNA expression is associated with decreased overall survival in AML; an analysis of three
different patient populations. The Kaplan-Meier curves (for survival analysis) and the log-rank test were performed by using the

statistical SPSS 19.0. P values (log-rank test) of the comparison of the various groups of patients are indicated in each of the figures.
(LEFT) The figure shows the results for the 27 unselected patients with newly diagnosed AML (Norwegian cohort) who received intensive
chemotherapy. The figure compares the survival for the 9 patients with the highest RINF levels with the 18 patients with intermediate and
low expression. The survival differed significantly between the two groups (p=0.012). (MIDDLE) The microarray dataset (Affymetrix
GeneChip Human Genome HG-U133B) performed by Metzeler KH et al. [6] (163 patients) was downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) with accession number GSE12417. The whole raw data were normalized using RMA
(Robust Multiarray Averaging method) with the Expression Console software from Affymetrix. Since there were 3 probesets targeting
CXXC5 (222996_s_at, 224516_s_at and 233955_x_at), the number of variable was reduced by PCA reduction analysis to determine the
CXXC5 mRNA expression. The patients have been classified in 3 equivalent groups according to a high (n=55), an intermediate (n=54), or a
low (n=54) RINF expression level. Here, the low (n=54) and intermediate (n=54) groups have been fused because they had similar survival.
Note that because of an odd number of patients (n=163) the groups included different numbers of patients (55 versus 54). (RIGHT) RINF
expression and survival was compared for 87 patients with core-binding factor AML; this analysis was also based on public microarray data
[7] and again we observed a significant association between overall survival and RINF mRNA expression

However, RINF knockdown was associated with increased
sensitivity to daunorubicin- and lenalidomide-induced
apoptosis (Figs. 3C and 3D). The susceptibility to druginduced apoptosis was not affected by RINF silencing
for the three cell lines with low expression (data not
shown). All these effects were reproduced in independent
experiments.

viability in drug-free cultures was also compared with
cells cultured with lenalidomide 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 µM. For
cells with low RINF expression, there was a low viability
after culture in medium alone and the viability seemed
to have reached a plateau and was not further decreased
by lenalidomide (lenalidomide 1.0 µM; median viability
15.5%, range 1.4-53.9%). In contrast, for AML cells
with high RINF expression, the viability after culture
in medium alone was higher and lenalidomide caused
a statistically significant and dose-dependent further
decrease in viability (lenalidomide 0.1 µM, no significant
effect; lenalidomide 0.5 µM, median viability 31.6%,
range 7.0-57.3%, p=0.0098; lenalidomide 1.0 µM, median
viability 31.6, range 6.8-50.8; p=0.0078) compared with
the corresponding drug-free cultures (median viability
44,2%, see above). The low-RINF patients showed
a similar low level of viable and apoptotic cells both
after culture in medium alone and in the presence of
lenalidomide, whereas the lenalidomide-induced decrease
in viability for the high-RINF patients was associated with
an increased fraction of apoptotic cells compared with
the corresponding cultures for low-RINF patients (Fig.
4; Mann-Whitney U-test, p=0.0004). To conclude, low-

Low CXXC5/RINF expression is associated with
decreased viability of in vitro cultured primary
AML cells but does not have a major impact on
leukemic cell proliferation
We compared apoptosis induction during in vitro
culture for the 9 patients with the highest and the 9 patients
with the lowest RINF expression in the Norwegian cohort
(see Fig. 1). The leukemic cells were cultured for 18
hours before the frequencies of viable, apoptotic and
necrotic cells were determined. In vitro cultured primary
AML cells show spontaneous or stress-induced apoptosis
that varies considerably between patients [9, 10]; this
was also true both for the AML cells with low (median
viability 22.5%, range 1.1-66.6%) and high (median

We also compared the surface exposure of
calreticulin for primary AML cells derived from the same
patients with high and low RINF expression (see Fig. 1);
the exposure was then compared after culture in medium
alone and in the presence of lenalidomide 0.1 µM (Fig. 4).
The surface exposure of calreticulin by non-viable AML
cells differed significantly when comparing patients with
high and low RINF expression (Fig. 4; Mann Whitney
U-test, p=0.035), but this difference was only seen when
cells were cultured with lenalidomide.
Taken together our studies of AML cell apoptosis
support the hypothesis that RINF is important for
regulation of viability/apoptosis also in primary human
AML cells, and the lenalidomide studies further suggest
that the chemotherapy-induced apoptotic phenotype differs
between patients with high and low RINF expression.
In a recent publication we describe that AML
patients can be subclassified into three major subsets
based on their in vitro proliferative capacity: (i) patients
with spontaneous/autocrine and strong cytokine-dependent
proliferation in the presence of several growth factors; (ii)
patients only showing cytokine-dependent proliferation;
and (iii) patients showing no or very weak autocrine and
cytokine-dependent proliferation (13). Patients with high
and low RINF expression showed a similar distribution
within all three subsets (26 unselected patients examined,
variation range for RINF 28-951, data not shown).

DISCUSSION

cells were derived from 9 patients with low and 9 patients with
high RINF expression. (LEFT) Primary AML cells with low
RINF expression were mainly necrotic after 18 hours in vitro
culture in medium alone, and the leukemic cells from these
patients showed a low level of viable as well as apoptotic (see
the figure for lenalidomide ) cells both in cultures prepared in
medium alone and cultures with lenalidomide. In contrast, for
patients with high RINF expression a higher viability was seen
after culture in medium alone. However, as shown in the figure
an increased fraction of apoptotic cells was then detected for
high-RINF patients when cells were cultured in the presence
of lenalidomide compared with the corresponding cultures
for low-RINF patients (see the figure; Mann Whitney U-test,
p=0.0004), and at the same time the viability further decreased
and the fraction of necrotic cells increased for the high-RINF
patients. Thus, maximal viability reduction is achieved by
spontaneous apoptosis alone for low-RINF patients but for
high-RINF patients combined spontaneous and lenalidomideinduced apoptosis is required to achieve the maximal reduction.
(RIGHT) The calreticulin exposure of AML cells cultured with
lenalidomide 0.1 µM was determined by flow cytometry [11].
A dye-exclusion Dead/Live Viability/Vitality analysis was used
to separate the leukemic cells into these two major subsets, and
calreticulin expression could thereby be analyzed separately for
dead and viable cells. The figure compares calreticulin exposure
after culture with lenalidomide (mean fluorescence intensity,
MFI) for the dead cells derived from patients with high and low
RINF expression (Mann Whitney U-test, p=0.035). The two
patient groups showed no difference in calreticulin exposure
when analyzing viable cells, and there was no difference after
culture in medium alone either (data not shown)

The CXXC5/RINF gene localizes to the 5q31.2
chromosomal region that can be involved in chromosomal
deletions associated with AML, and for this reason we
investigated the possible role of RINF in this disease.
RINF expression was investigated in primary human AML
cells derived from a large group of unselected patients. We
did not detect mutations in the RINF encoding regions and
in this relatively small Norwegian cohort there were no
significant associations between RINF mRNA expression
and FLT3-ITD or NPM1 mutations. Importantly, high
RINF expression was associated with an adverse
prognosis and experimental studies demonstrated that
RINF mediated antiapoptotic activity; taken together our
observations therefore suggest that therapeutic targeting/
inhibition of RINF should be considered for the treatment
of high-risk AML. Whether RINF expression in addition
is an independent prognostic parameter in human AML
requires additional clinical studies and cannot be judged
from our present results.
Our methodological strategy for sampling of AML
cells from patients with relatively high levels of circulating
AML cells has been described and discussed in detail
previously [12], and our previous data have shown that
the patients are representative for AML in general with
regard to the major prognostic parameters, i.e. clinical
chemosensitivity [12-14]. By using this strategy, highly

enriched AML cell populations could be prepared by
gradient separation alone; more extensive cell separation
procedures may alter the molecular profile or functional
characteristics of primary AML cells [14]. However,
despite these previous characterizations, we emphasize
that our results may be representative only for the selected
subset of patients, even though our patients showed an
expected distribution with regard to morphological signs
of differentiation as well as genetic abnormalities (Table
1).
We observed an association between monocytic
differentiation and RINF expression, and this is similar
to normal hematopoiesis where RINF expression also
depends on the differentiation status of myeloid cells
[1]. We also observed a lower level for patients with
favorable compared to adverse cytogenetic abnormalities
in our Norwegian cohort, but this last observation has
to be interpreted with great care because we examined
unselected patients with a high median age and very
few patients with favorable cytogenetics were therefore
included [12]. Finally, we could not detect mutations of
the CXXC5 gene for any of our patients, and the same was
also observed in a previous study [15].
We investigated the association between RINF
expression and overall survival for five different patient
populations receiving intensive chemotherapy for newly
diagnosed AML. The overall survival for these relatively
young patients is mainly reflected by the clinical
chemosensitivity, ie. the frequencies of primary resistant
disease and later AML relapse [3]. A similar association
between high RINF levels and adverse prognosis was
observed both for (i) unselected patients; (ii) patients
with normal cytogenetics and (iii) patients with genetic
abnormalities affecting core-binding factors who have a
good prognosis (Fig. 2). These observations support the
hypothesis that high RINF expression is associated with an
adverse prognosis. A similar association has been observed
in patients with breast cancer where high expression is
also associated with adverse prognosis [16].
We used well-characterized AML cell lines to study
the effects of RINF expression on chemosensitivity. K562
cells then represents a standardized experimental model
of immature myeloid leukemic cells. Our experiments
demonstrated that RINF knock-down was associated
with an increased susceptibility to chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis. This observation suggests that RINF expression
contributes to the chemoresistant AML cell phenotype.
We compared the viability of primary AML cells
during in vitro culture for patients showing high and
low RINF expression. Both groups showed an expected
spontaneous in vitro apoptosis and a reduction of viability
during culture [9, 10]. The cells were also cultured without
and with lenalidomide; this drug was chosen because it is
now tried in AML therapy [17-20] and it can be used in the
treatment of MDS with the 5q- abnormality and low RINF
expression [1, 2, 21]. In these drug-containing cultures the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

viability is thus determined by the spontaneous in vitro
apoptosis together with additional drug-induced apoptosis.
A maximal reduction of AML cell viability during in vitro
culture was reached by stress-induced apoptosis alone
for the low-RINF group, whereas the maximal reduction
required a combination of stress-induced and drug-induced
apoptosis for the high-RINF patients. The two groups
also differed in their apoptotic phenotype with regard to
calreticulin exposure during cell death. Taken together,
these results support the hypothesis that RINF is important
for regulation of apoptosis in human AML cells. Similar
to the K562 experiments (Fig. 3B) we did not detect any
significant correlation between proliferative capacity and
RINF expression for primary human AML cells.
Previous studies in other experimental models
suggest that pharmacological inhibition of antiapoptotic intracellular signaling in human AML cells
can induce apoptosis or increase proapoptotic effects
of chemotherapy [22-26]; therapeutic targeting of
CXXC5/RINF may therefore represent a novel and
alternative strategy to increase proapoptotic activity
and thereby chemosensitivity in human AML cells. The
molecular mechanisms behind the proapoptotic activity
of CXXC5/RINF silencing in AML cells are not known.
Observations in neuronal cells and developing kidney
have suggested that WT1 induce RINF expression and
thereby downregulate signaling through the WNT-betacathenin pathway [27, 28]. The correlation between WT1
and CXXC5/RINF expression may suggest that there is
a crosstalk between these two molecules also in primary
AML cells. However, the WNT-beta-cathenin pathway
can be constitutively activated in AML cells [29] and
this activation seems to mediate antiapoptotic effects [30,
31]. Thus, the antiapoptotic effect of RINF in AML cells
is probably mediated through other mechanisms than
downregulation of proapoptotic signaling through the
WNT-beta-cathenin pathway.
RINF was also expressed in normal hematopoietic
cells and hematological toxicity is therefore a possibility
if RINF inhibition is tried in AML treatment. In our
opinion the expression of RINF in normal bone marrow
cells does not exclude the possibility to consider RINF
targeting in AML therapy. Firstly, preparation of CD34+
enriched cells requires more extensive cell separation
procedures than simple gradient separation and this
ex vivo handling may alter RINF expression [13, 14].
Secondly, several patients showed higher AML cell levels
than the median levels of normal cells, especially highrisk patients. Thirdly, viability is probably not determined
by a single pathway but by the balance between pro- and
antiapoptotic signaling; the functional consequences of
RINF inhibition will be determined by this balance and
may thereby differ between normal and leukemic cells
[32]. Finally, as discussed in detail previously combined
targeting of different apoptosis-regulating pathways is a
promising strategy in cancer treatment [33], and it may
1444

Oncotarget 2013; 4: 1438-1448

then be possible to design combinations that include
RINF targeting but at the same time have acceptable
hematological toxicity (33). However, the final answer
to the important question of toxicity can only come from
preclinical pharmacological studies in animal leukemia
models [34, 35] and eventually clinical studies.
The importance of stromal cells in carcinogenesis
and for chemosensitivity of human malignancies was
discussed in a recent review [36]. Targeting of the
stromal cells may thus be a possible strategy both in the
treatment of solid tumors [37, 38] as well as hematological
malignancies [39]. A recent study suggested that targeting
of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway will affect bone marrow
stromal cells and thereby have indirect effects on AML
cells [39]. Future studies should therefore investigate
whether CXXC5/RINF is expressed in bone marrow
stromal cells and whether CXXC5/RINF targeting will
affect stromal cells and thereby have indirect effects on
the leukemic cells.
In summary, RINF expression shows a wide
variation in primary human AML cells and high levels
are associated with decreased overall survival after
chemotherapy. Furthermore, RINF seems to mediate
antiapoptotic effects. Taken together these observations
suggest that therapeutic targeting/inhibition of RINF
should be considered as a possible therapeutic strategy in
human AML, especially for those patients whose leukemia
show a higher expression than normal hematopoietic
cells..

Expression Analysis of RINF Transcript Levels
For the unselected patients cohort from Bergen
(n=59), total RNA was purified from snap-frozen cell
pellet samples with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.
Gaithersburg, MD) extraction protocol according to
manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was dissolved in
100 μl of diethylpyrocarbonate-treated ddH2O after
extraction. First-strand complementary DNA synthesis
(RT) was carried out starting with total RNA (1 μg) in
a 20 μl volume using oligo-dT primers with Transcriptor
Reverse Transcriptase (Roche, Basel, Switzerland, Cat.
N°03531287001) in accordance with the manufacturer’s
instructions. Quantitative PCRs (qPCR) were carried out
using specific hydrolysis probes targeting RINF gene on a
LightCycler 480 machine (Roche) in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions of the kit LightCycler® 480
ProbesMaster (Cat. N°04707494001). Relative messenger
RNA (mRNA) expressions were normalized to ribosomal
protein P2 (RPLP2) gene expression in a two-color
duplex reaction. Primers and thermocycling conditions

MATERIAL AND METHODS

Sequence analysis of RINF gene

Leukemia patients and preparation of leukemic
cells

Amplification of the coding region of RINF gene was
carried out using forward primer 5’-gtggaccctcggcagttg-3’
and reverse primer 5’-cacacgagcagtgacattgc-3’. PCR
amplification was carried out using Dynazyme EXT
DNA polymerase (FINNZYMES, Espoo, Finland) in a 50
μl reaction mixture containing 1X PCR buffer, 1.5 mM
MgCl2, 0.5 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate,
5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 0.2 μM of each primer and
DNA template (0.5 μl cDNA or 1 μl genomic DNA).
The PCR conditions were an initial denaturation step of
5 min at 94°C followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94°C,
30 s at 63°C, and 1 min at 72°C, followed by a final
elongation step of 7 min at 72°C. Before sequencing,
PCR products were purified using the ExoSAP-IT
kit (GE healthcare, Waukesha, WI, Cat. N° 78201).
Sequencing was done using BigDye® v3.1 cycle
sequencing kit (ABI, Foster City, CA, Cat. N° 4337456)
with specific forward (5’-gcacaaaagtggtgctgtg-3’) or
reverse (5’-gcgtggtgcaggagcat-3’) sequencing primers
in a total volume of 10 μl. Thermal conditions were 25
cycles of denaturation at 96°C for 10 s, annealing at 50°C
for 5 s, and elongation at 60°C for 4 min. Capillary 4

patients (Norwegian cohorts). The study was approved by
the local Ethics Committee (Regional Ethics Committee
III, University of Bergen, Norway) and samples collected
after written informed consent; 59 consecutive patients
with high peripheral blood blast counts (>7 x 109/L)
were included (Table 1). This selection of patients and
the analysis of FLT3 and NPM1 mutations have been
described previously [12, 40]. AML cells were isolated
by density gradient separation (Lymphoprep, Axis-Shield,
Oslo, Norway) and contained at least 95% leukemic blasts.
The cells were stored in liquid nitrogen until used in the
experiments [12].

solution in PBS pH7.4 for 20 min. Cells were washed
again once and permeabilized using freshly prepared
0.1%Triton -0.1% sodium citrate buffer for 8 min on ice.
After 2 washes, cells were incubated for 1h in TUNEL
reaction mixture containing Terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase which catalyses polymerization of labeled
nucleotides to free 3’OH-DNA ends of DNA strand
breaks (mixed to label solution 1:50). The cells were
finally washed three times, dropped on glass slides and
mounted in Vectashield mounting medium containing
4-, 6-diaminidine-2-phenylindole (DAPI 6 Vector
Laboratories) to counterstain nuclei. TMR red labeled
cells (apoptotic cells) were detected by fluorescent
microscopy (Leica DMRD, equipped with 63x objective,
Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and FACS analysis.

Analysis of confirmation datasets microarrays
The microarray datasets (Affymetrix GeneChip
Human Genome HG-U133B) performed by Metzeler
KH et al. [6], Bullinger L et al. [7] and Gaidzik VI et
al. [8] were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/)
with accession numbers GSE12417, GSE8653 and GSE
23312, respectively. The whole raw data were normalized
using RMA (Robust Multiarray Averaging method) with
the Expression Console software from Affymetrix. There
were three probesets targeting CXXC5 mRNA expression.
Expression score (Normalized and log2 transformed) were
reduced in one expression score by principal component
analysis using the first principal component. The factor
scores were also rescaled so that the minimal value of the
score for each gene is 0 and the maximal value is 1.

RINF silencing and chemosensitivity
hematopoietic AML cell lines

In vitro culture of primary human AML cells
Cells were cultured in StemSpan serum-free
medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml of gentamicin
(Stem Cell Technologies Inc, Vancouver, BC, Canada) [9,
10]. Lenalidomide (Selleck Chemicals, Munich, Germany)
was dissolved in DMSO and used at final concentrations
of 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10 µM. Pilot experiments
demonstrated that DMSO at the final concentrations used
in the experiments did not affect AML cells. Leukemic
cells (1 x 106 cells/ml) were cultured at 37ºC in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 24 hours before
analysis by flow cytometry of AML cell viability/apoptosis
(annexin expression/propidium iodide exclusion) and
calreticulin surface exposure after live-dead gating [9, 10].

of

In vitro culture and lentiviral transduction of human
AML cell lines. The K562 AML cell line was cultured in
RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Biochrom AG), 2 mM L-Glutamine,
50 units/ml penicillin G and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life
Technologies). For RINF knock-down experiments,
AML cells were transduced with pTRIP lentiviral vector
that drives the constitutive expression of GFP (Green
Fluorescent Protein) for cell sorting, and either a shorthairpin RNA targeting RINF sequence (shRNA-RINF) or
an non relevant sequence (non-target-shRNA control).
WST-1 assay for assessment of cell proliferation/
viability. Cell viability was measured using the WST-1
assay (Roche Diagnostics, Paris, France). The myeloid
cells were seeded (105 cells/mL) in triplicates in 96-well
plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) and cultured for 24 h
prior to addition of daunorubicin. After 48h of culture
the WST-1 labeling mixture (10 μl) was added and the
cells were incubated for additional 30-120 minutes. The
absorbance of the samples against a background control
of medium alone was measured at 450 nm.

Statistical analyses
Comparisons of the RINF mRNA expression levels
in different subgroups of AML were performed using the
Mann-Whitney rank test (for independent samples) and
Wilcoxon’s rank test (for dependent samples) by using
the statistical software package SPSS 17.0. Spearman’s
test was used for correlation analyses. Survival data was
analyzed using log-Rank test (Kaplan-Meier).
