Abstract
Cancer stem cells (CSC) have been implicated in disease
recurrence, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance, but effective
targeting strategies for these cells are still wanting. VS-5584 is a
potent and selective dual inhibitor of mTORC1/2 and class I
PI 3-kinases. Here, we report that VS-5584 is up to 30-fold more
potent in inhibiting the proliferation and survival of CSC
compared with non-CSC in solid tumor cell populations. VS5584 preferentially diminished CSC levels in multiple mouse
xenograft models of human cancer, as evidenced by marked
reduction of tumor-initiating capacity in limiting dilution
assays. Likewise, VS-5584 treatment ex vivo preferentially
reduced CSC in surgically resected breast and ovarian patient
tumors. In contrast, chemotherapeutics such as paclitaxel and
cisplatin were less effective in targeting CSC than bulk tumor
cells. Mechanistic investigations revealed that preferential tar-

geting of CSC required inhibition of multiple components of
the PI3K–mTOR pathway: coordinate RNAi-mediated silencing
of PI3Ka, PI3Kb, and mTOR phenocopied the effect of VS5584, exhibiting the strongest preferential targeting of CSC,
while silencing of individual PI3K isoforms or mTOR failed to
replicate the effect of VS-5584. Consistent with CSC ablation,
VS-5584 delayed tumor regrowth following chemotherapy in
xenograft models of small-cell lung cancer. Taken together, the
preferential targeting of CSC prompts a new paradigm for
clinical testing of VS-5584: clinical trials designed with CSCdirected endpoints may facilitate demonstration of the therapeutic beneﬁt of VS-5584. We suggest that combining VS-5584
with classic chemotherapy that debulks tumors may engender a
more effective strategy to achieve durable remissions in patients
with cancer. Cancer Res; 75(2); 446–55. 2014 AACR.

Introduction

mTORC1 and mTORC2, each with different downstream substrates (9). The PI3K–mTOR pathway also plays a role in CSC
(8, 10–14). Activation of the PI3K–mTOR pathway in adult blood
cells through PTEN deletion led to the generation of leukemiainitiating cells (11). Similarly, activation of PI3K–mTOR signaling, achieved by knocking down PTEN, enriched breast CSC (13).
VS-5584 is a highly potent and selective dual PI3K–mTOR
inhibitor, exhibiting approximately equal low nanomolar potency against mTOR kinase and all four class I isoforms of PI3K. VS5584 was shown to target the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes
as well as PI3K in cells, as evidenced by inhibition of phosphorylation of cellular targets of these kinases, including AKT (Ser473
and Thr308) and ribosomal protein S6 (Ser240/244; ref. 15). VS5584 shows no signiﬁcant inhibitory activity against more than
400 other protein and lipid kinases, including closely related
lipid kinases such as DNA-PK and VSP34, underscoring the high
selectivity of VS-5584 (15). Simultaneous inhibition of mTORC1/
2 and PI3K by VS-5584 is expected to more effectively shut down
PI3K–mTOR signaling than isoform-selective PI3K or mTOR
inhibitors that block only a subset of these targets. This approach
should also overcome the feedback activation of PI3K signaling
that is thought to limit the effectiveness of rapamycin analogs
(8, 9). It was reported recently that activation of mTOR accounted
for the resistance of breast cancer to the PI3Ka-selective inhibitor
BYL719 in the clinic, further arguing the importance of simultaneous inhibition of mTOR and PI3K (16).
Here, we report that in addition to exhibiting potent anticancer
activity in a broad set of tumor models, VS-5584 preferentially
targets CSC as demonstrated using a panel of orthogonal CSC
assays, including the limiting dilution tumor-initiating assay, a

Chemoresistance and cancer relapse represent signiﬁcant challenges in cancer management, and are attributable in part to the
presence of subpopulations of cancer cells termed cancer stem
cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells. CSC were ﬁrst identiﬁed in
acute myeloid leukemia (1, 2) and are operationally deﬁned by
their self-renewal and tumor initiation capacities. The presence of
CSC in solid tumors was ﬁrst described in breast cancer (3) and
has since been identiﬁed in a wide variety of solid tumors, and
implicated in resistance to anticancer therapies, cancer recurrence,
and metastasis. (4–7).
The phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K–mTOR) pathway is one of the most frequently activated
signaling pathways in cancer, playing a central role in tumorigenesis by regulating the proliferation, survival, differentiation,
and migration of cancer cells as well as tumor angiogenesis (8).
AKT and mTOR are the major effector kinases in the PI3K–mTOR
pathway. mTOR exists in two distinct protein complexes,

VS-5584 Preferentially Targets Cancer Stem Cells

gold standard for CSC. Consistent with the observation that VS5584 preferentially abolishes CSC, VS-5584 delayed tumor
regrowth in small-cell lung xenograft models after cessation of
treatment with cisplatin. These results provide compelling rationale for the clinical development of VS-5584 as a CSC targeting
agent.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, primary human tumor tissues, compounds, and
reagents
All cancer cell lines used were obtained from the ATCC with the
exception of SUM159, which was acquired from Asterand. Cell
lines were authenticated by STR (short tandem repeat) analysis at
either ATCC or IDEXX Radil. V12H-Ras–transformed human
mammary epithelial cells (HMLER) were obtained from the
Broad Institute and maintained as described previously (17).
Primary human breast and ovarian tumor specimens were
obtained from Tissue Solutions Ltd. after patients' consent and
institutional IRB approval. VS-5584 was synthesized by S Bio
(15). Other compounds were purchased from Selleckchem.
Reverse-Phase Protein Microarray (RPMA) was conducted at
Theranostics Health Inc.
Aldeﬂuor assays
An imaging-based Aldeﬂuor assay was conducted using the
Aldeﬂuor Assay Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) with the following modiﬁcations: cells were plated in collagen-treated plates.
Following compound treatment, Aldeﬂuor reagents supplemented with 10 ng/mL Hoechst 33342 dye were added. Plates were
incubated at 37 C for 20 minutes. After washing, Aldeﬂuorþ
and total cells (in buffer containing Hoechst 33342) were
quantiﬁed using Celigo (Nexcelom Bioscience). ALDH inhibitor
diethylamino benzaldehyde (DEAB)–treated cells were used
as a negative control. FACS-based Aldeﬂuor assay was conducted following the manufacturer's instructions (STEMCELL
Technologies).
Side Population assays
Hoechst 33342 exclusion (Side Population) assay was carried
out as previously described (18).
HMLER assay
HMLER cells were treated with compounds for 4 days. Following a 4-day compound wash-off and cell recovery period, cells
were stained with PE-labeled anti-CD24, APC-labeled anti-CD44
antibody (BD Biosciences), and 7-AADþ live cells were subject to
FACS analysis. APC-labeled IgG 2bK and PE-labeled IgG2aK (BD
Biosciences) were used as isotype controls for CD44 and CD24,
respectively.
Tumorsphere assay
To determine tumorsphere forming efﬁciency, cells from tissue
culture or dissociated tumors were plated in tumorsphere forming
medium as previously described (17). Spheres were enumerated
using Celigo.
Apoptosis assays and siRNA transfection
Standard methods were used for Annexin V and caspase-3/7
assays and siRNA transfection with details in Supplementary
Materials and Methods.

In vivo tumor xenograft studies, cell dissociation, and limiting
dilution assay
For the SCLC PDX study, 105 cells of p2 SCLC PDXact tumor
(Molecular Response) admixed with Cultrex ECM (Trevigen) were
subcutaneously injected into NOD-SCID mice (Harlan). When
tumors reached an average size of 200 mm3, mice were randomized with 5 mice per group and treated with vehicle control,
cisplatin (i.p. once a week for 2 weeks), or cisplatin followed by
VS-5584 (orally, three times weekly for 4 weeks). Details of other
tumor xenograft studies are in Supplementary Materials and
Methods. To dissociate single cells, tumor tissue was minced into
smaller pieces and incubated with Liberase (Roche Applied Science) or dispase for 1 hour at 37 C under agitation. Mouse cells
were removed from xenograft human tumors using mouse antibodies and magnetic beads.
For the limiting dilution assay, cells dissociated from xenograft
tumors were admixed with Matrigel and injected into the mammary fat pad (for MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast tumors) or
subcutaneously (NCI-H841 tumors) of immunodeﬁcient SHrN
mice (Harlan). Tumor-initiating frequency (TIF) was calculated
using the ELDA Software (19).

Results
Preferential targeting of CSC by VS-5584 in vitro
In a previous screening of more than 300,000 compounds
using an HMLE CSC assay (17), a number of PI3K–mTOR
pathway inhibitors were found to preferentially target CSC. This
historic observation prompted our initial interest in exploring the
PI3K–mTOR pathway to target CSC. We therefore determined the
effect of VS-5584, a highly potent and selective dual inhibitor of
PI3K–mTOR (15), on CSC in multiple orthogonal CSC assays that
have been validated by limiting dilution implantation in mice.
CSC have high aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity,
which can be measured by the Aldeﬂuor enzymatic assay (20).
Aldeﬂuorþ cells from several breast cancer cell lines have been
shown to display CSC characteristics (21). We also show that
Aldeﬂuorþ SUM159 triple-negative breast cancer cells display
enhanced self-renewal and tumor-initiating capability relative to
Aldeﬂuor cells in immunodeﬁcient mice (Supplementary Fig.
S1). To quantify CSC that harbor high ALDH activity, we developed an imaging-based Aldeﬂuor assay. As shown in Fig. 1A,
although VS-5584 dose-dependently reduced both Aldeﬂuorþ
and Aldeﬂuor cell populations, it was far more potent against the
Aldeﬂuorþ CSC within the SUM159 cell line. A similar preferential effect of VS-5584 on Aldeﬂuorþ CSC was observed using the
estrogen receptor–positive (ERþ) MCF7 and carcinosarcoma
Hs578T cell lines (Fig. 1A), indicating that VS-5584 exerts an
approximately 10- to 30-fold more potent inhibitory effect on
CSC than bulk tumor cells across these cell lines. In contrast,
exposure to the cytotoxic agents paclitaxel or cisplatin increased
the percentage of Aldeﬂuorþ cells (Fig. 1B), consistent with CSC
being resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Importantly, VS5584 attenuated paclitaxel-induced enrichment of Aldeﬂuorþ
cells (Fig. 1C).
A tumorsphere assay can be used to measure the self-renewal of
CSC (22). SUM159 and MCF-7 tumorspheres were treated with
VS-5584, paclitaxel, or combination of both agents, and the effect
of these treatments on CSC was determined in a secondary
tumorsphere assay. Tumorsphere forming efﬁciency was
decreased by VS-5584 but increased by paclitaxel. Strikingly,

combination of VS-5584 and paclitaxel almost completely abolished tumorsphere formation, indicating a marked reduction of
CSC (Fig. 1D).
Enhanced drug efﬂux is another attribute of CSC. Thus CSC,
when assayed by their ability to exclude the Hoechst 33342 dye,
are found to reside in a side population (SP) with greater dye
exclusion capacity (18). As with the Aldeﬂuor assay, we ﬁrst
validated that SP of SUM159 cells indeed exhibited elevated
tumor-initiating capability relative to non-SP (Supplementary
Fig. S2). To determine the effect of VS-5584 on SP CSC, SUM159

cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions (1% O2) to enrich
for CSC (23). VS-5584 markedly reduced the proportion of SP
cells with less than 1% SP remaining following treatment with 100
nmol/L VS-5584 and no detectable SP CSC following 1 mmol/L
VS-5584 treatment. Similarly, VS-5584 also reduced the proportion of SP cells in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1E).
In the HMLER cell line model, the CD44hi/CD24lo subpopulation has been demonstrated to possess characteristics of CSC
(17). A distinct CD44hi/CD24lo population was most evident in
the HMLER cells that survived paclitaxel treatment, and this

helped to set the gate for FACS analysis across all samples.
Whereas paclitaxel treatment signiﬁcantly increased the percentage of CD44hi/CD24lo cells compared to the control sample, VS5584 abolished the CD44hi/CD24lo cells with greater than 10-fold
reduction (Fig. 1F). Taken together, these data demonstrate that
VS-5584 has a strong preferential inhibitory effect on CSC in direct
contrast with the cytotoxic agents paclitaxel and cisplatin, suggesting that CSC have an increased dependency on PI3K–mTOR
signaling compared with non-CSC.
Preferential induction of apoptosis by VS-5584 in CSC
Because VS-5584 dramatically reduced the proportion of CSCcontaining population, we surmised that VS-5584 might induce
stronger apoptosis in CSC. To test this hypothesis, SUM159 cells
were treated with VS-5584 or DMSO control for 24 hours and the
percentage of Annexin V–positive apoptotic cells was determined
for both the Aldeﬂuorþ and Aldeﬂuor subpopulations. VS-5584
(500 nmol/L) induced apoptosis in 8% of Aldeﬂuorþ cells com-

pared with 2% of Aldeﬂuor cells (Fig. 2A), indicating that VS5584 selectively induced apoptosis in CSC. In addition, SUM159
cells were sorted for Aldeﬂuorþ and Aldeﬂuor cells and each
subpopulation was treated with VS-5584 for 24 hours. Apoptosis
was assessed by a caspase-3/7 assay. VS-5584 induced 2-fold
greater caspase activation in Aldeﬂuorþ cells compared with
Aldeﬂuor cells (Fig. 2B). Similarly, VS-5584 caused more pronounced apoptosis induction in SP cells as compared with non-SP
cells (Fig. 2C and D). In contrast, paclitaxel induced slightly more
apoptosis in non-CSC than CSC (Fig. 2B–D). Altogether, these
results indicate that VS-5584 preferentially induces apoptosis in
CSC relative to non-CSC.
Preferential targeting of CSC by VS-5584 in the MDA-MB-231
triple-negative breast cancer model in vivo
We subsequently determined whether similar preferential targeting of CSC occurs in vivo. We ﬁrst used MDA-MB-231 triplenegative human breast cancer cells implanted orthotopically in

the mouse mammary fat pad. After tumors reached a volume of
approximately 200 mm3, VS-5584 was administered orally at 25
mg/kg once daily for 9 days. Tumors were harvested and dissociated into single cells and subjected to CSC assays without further
compound treatment (Fig. 3A). Results of the Aldeﬂuor assay
showed that the percentage of Aldeﬂuorþ cells was relatively low
with an average of 0.7% in control tumors, VS-5584 treatment
caused signiﬁcant reduction of the proportion of Aldeﬂuorþ CSC
to 0.2% (P ¼ 0.015, Fig. 3B, Supplementary Fig. S5). A more
rigorous and functional test for CSC is the limiting dilution assay.
Accordingly, cells dissociated from either VS-5584- or vehicletreated tumors were injected into immunodeﬁcient mice in limiting dilutions. Cells from VS-5584–treated tumors displayed a 7fold reduction of TIF, conﬁrming reduction of CSC in tumors by
VS-5584 treatment (Fig. 3C).
Differential effects of VS-5584 and everolimus on CSC in the
ERþ MCF7 breast cancer model in vivo
Similar to our observations using the MDA-MB-231 model,
VS-5584 treatment also reduced the proportion of CSC in the
MCF7 ERþ breast tumor xenograft model, as evidenced by a
signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of Aldeﬂuorþ cells,
tumorsphere forming efﬁciency, and TIF in a limiting dilution
assay (Fig. 3D–F).
Because VS-5584 inhibits multiple nodes of the PI3K–mTOR
signaling pathway, we reasoned that inhibition of CSC by VS5584 might involve effects on more than one of these pathway
components. To test this hypothesis, we investigated effects of the
potent mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus on CSC in the same MCF7
xenograft model. In contrast with VS-5584, oral daily dosing of
everolimus at 5 mg/kg, shown to inhibit mTORC1 activity in
tumors as evidenced by reduction of S6 phosphorylation (Fig.
3G), did not reduce the proportion of CSC, as measured by
multiple assays (Fig. 3D–F). Collectively, these data suggest that
inhibition of components of the PI3K–mTOR pathway other than

The role of PI3K isoforms and mTOR in the preferential
targeting of CSC by VS-5584
To further assess the contribution of individual PI3K isoforms
and mTOR in mediating the CSC effect of VS-5584, SUM159 cells
were transfected with siRNA speciﬁc for PI3Ka, PI3Kb, or mTOR
individually or in combination. Two different siRNA sequences
were used per gene. An Aldeﬂuor assay was carried out 3 days after
siRNA transfection. PI3Kd and PI3Kg were not examined because
they are mostly expressed in leukocytes and their role in epithelial
cells is not established (24). Single isoform knockdown of PI3Ka,
PI3Kb or mTOR resulted in a moderate increase in the percentage
of Aldeﬂuorþ cells compared with scrambled control siRNA.
Importantly, double knockdown of PI3Ka and PI3Kb, PI3Ka and
mTOR, or PI3Kb and mTOR decreased the percentage of
Aldeﬂuorþ CSC to some extent, whereas triple knockdown of
PI3Ka, PI3Kb, and mTOR, which mirrors the kinase inhibition
proﬁle of VS-5584, showed the most striking 70% reduction of the
proportion of Aldeﬂuorþ cells (Fig. 4A). Effective target knockdown by all siRNAs was conﬁrmed by Western blot analysis (Fig.
4B). These data further support the notion that inhibition of
multiple components of the PI3K–mTOR pathway by VS-5584 is
critical for the observed preferential targeting of CSC.
Preferential targeting of CSC by VS-5584 in primary human
tumor tissue samples
Having demonstrated that VS-5584 preferentially reduced CSC
in both cell line models and in vivo tumor xenografts, we determined if ex vivo treatment with VS-5584 preferentially targets CSC
in surgically removed primary human tumor specimens. Ex vivo
treatment of breast tumor tissue fragments with VS-5584 for 5
days reduced the proportion of both CD44hi/CD24lo (Fig. 5A)
and Aldeﬂuorþ (Fig. 5B) CSC. The modest effect on the tumor of
patient 3 (Fig. 5A and B) may be explained by a sample quality
issue, as there were signiﬁcantly fewer live cells available for FACS
analysis compared with tumors of patients 1 and 2 (Fig. 5A). We
reasoned that other carcinomas, such as ovarian cancer, might
depend on similar CSC signaling pathways. Accordingly, ex vivo
treatment with VS-5584 was undertaken using ovarian tumor
tissue, surgically removed from 2 patients who had received prior
taxane- and platinum-based chemotherapy. Ex vivo treatment
with 100 nmol/L VS-5584 for 5 days reduced the proportion of
CD44hi/CD117hi cells, previously validated as a CSC marker in
ovarian cancer (25), in both ovarian cancer patient tumor specimens (Fig. 5C). To further evaluate the effect of VS-5584 on
tumor-initiating cells, 10,000 cells dissociated from the above
control- or VS-5584–treated ovarian tumor specimens were
implanted subcutaneously into immunodeﬁcient mice. After
17 weeks, mice injected with cells from control-treated ovarian
tumor specimens 1 and 2 developed tumors, whereas no tumors
formed in mice injected with cells from VS-5584–treated tumor
specimens (Fig. 5D). Thus, the results from ex vivo treatment of
primary patient tumor specimens are in agreement with our
ﬁndings with cell lines and xenograft tumors, and indicate that
VS-5584 preferentially reduces CSC populations.
Effects of VS-5584 on tumor regrowth after chemotherapy
CSC have been postulated to account for tumor recurrence
after chemotherapy (4). We therefore hypothesized that, by

preferentially eliminating CSC, VS-5584 might delay tumor
regrowth after initial treatment with chemotherapy. Small-cell
lung cancer (SCLC) represents a logical setting to test this hypothesis as most patients with SCLC initially respond to chemotherapy
but subsequently experience tumor recurrence (26). The effect of
VS-5584 on tumor-initiating CSC of SCLC was, therefore, assessed
in the NCI-H841 SCLC xenograft model in vivo. VS-5584 treatment caused signiﬁcant tumor growth inhibition (P ¼ 0.003, Fig.
6A) and reduced the proportion of CSC in NCI-H841 tumors as
evidenced by a signiﬁcant decrease in the percentage of SP cells (P
¼ 0.006; Fig. 6B). Furthermore, cells dissociated from NCI-H841
tumors of VS-5584–treated mice showed a striking 67-fold reduction in tumor-initiating frequency when injected in limiting
dilutions into immunodeﬁcient mice, indicating a marked depletion of CSC by VS-5584 in xenograft tumors (Fig. 6C).
Subsequently, we sought to determine if VS-5584 can delay
tumor regrowth after initial debulking by cisplatin, a standard-ofcare ﬁrst-line chemotherapeutic agent, in human SCLC xenograft
models. Before in vivo experiments, we conﬁrmed that cisplatin or
etoposide was not effective in depleting CSC of SCLC cell lines; in
fact, both agents enriched CSC, whereas VS-5584 depleted CSC in
vitro (Supplementary Fig. S3). In the NCI-H69 SCLC xenograft
study, weekly i.p. dosing of 5 mg/kg cisplatin for 2 weeks induced
initial tumor regression, but these tumors regrew quickly after
cessation of cisplatin treatment. Single agent VS-5584 at 15 mg/kg
dosed orally once daily caused signiﬁcant inhibition of NCIH69 tumor growth (P < 0.05). In combination, VS-5584 substantially delayed the regrowth of NCI-H69 tumors following cessa-

tion of cisplatin treatment (Fig. 6D). Patient-derived–xenograft
(PDX) models, which preserve the histology and heterogeneity of
patient tumors, may be more relevant models for CSC research
(27, 28). We, therefore, tested VS-5584 in a SCLC PDX model
established from a lymph node metastasis of a patient with SCLC.
In keeping with our observations with the NCI-H69 model, VS5584 administered following cessation of cisplatin dosing
delayed tumor regrowth (Fig. 6E). These results are consistent
with the suppression of cisplatin-resistant CSC by VS-5584,
resulting in a longer delay of tumor regrowth after cessation of
cisplatin treatment.

Discussion
Intensive efforts have been devoted to targeting the PI3K–
mTOR pathway due to its critical importance in the proliferation
and survival of cancer cells. Here, we report that, in addition to
exhibiting broad and robust antitumor activity in animal models
(15), VS-5584, a potent dual PI3K–mTOR kinase inhibitor, also
exerts a preferential effect on CSC present in cell culture, in human
tumor xenografts, and in surgically excised human tumor specimens. In stark contrast, the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent
paclitaxel, cisplatin, and etoposide increased the proportion of
CSC. Our observation that VS-5584 inhibited tumor regrowth
after effective treatment with cisplatin in SCLC models, including
a patient-derived primary tumor model, is consistent with the
notion that VS-5584 may delay tumor recurrence at least in part
through the suppression of CSC. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst

comprehensive evaluation of the effect of a highly selective PI3K–
mTOR inhibitor on CSC.
The PI3K–mTOR pathway has been shown to be important for
the proliferation of CSC in both solid tumors and leukemias (10–
14). In prostate cancer, a CD133þ/CD44þ subpopulation with
progenitor/stem cell characteristics was shown to exhibit higher
PI3K–mTOR pathway activity, and treatment with the PI3K–
mTOR inhibitor BEZ-235 suppressed the proliferation of such
prostate CSC (10). PF-04691502, another dual PI3K–mTOR
inhibitor, was recently shown to inhibit the proliferation of CSC
in vitro and to inhibit tumor growth in a colon CSC-derived
xenograft model (29). However, in these various studies, a critical
unanswered question remained whether PI3K–mTOR inhibitors
exert a general antiproliferative effect against both CSC and nonCSC, or whether the CSC are more dependent on the PI3K–mTOR
pathway than are non-CSC. Interestingly, Korkaya and colleagues
(13) reported that the AKT inhibitor perifosine reduced the

www.aacrjournals.org

proportion of ALDHþ CSC as well as tumor-initiating cells in
breast tumor models, suggesting that perifosine has preferential
effects on breast CSC. In light of the fact that perifosine was
subsequently reported to also inhibit EGFR and c-Met phosphorylation (30), the CSC effect of perifosine could be due to inhibition of these other molecular targets in addition to AKT.
VS-5584 is highly selective for class I PI3K isoforms and mTOR
kinase with no signiﬁcant activity against more than 400 other
protein and lipid kinases proﬁled (15). We provide clear evidence
that inhibition of mTORC1, mTORC2, and PI3K isoforms by VS5584 confers a strong preferential inhibitory effect on CSC across
different carcinoma types, including breast, ovarian, and SCLC.
Whereas VS-5584 preferentially abolished CSC in the MCF7
breast tumor model, an mTORC1-selective inhibitor everolimus
did not reduce the proportion of CSC. Rapamycin, a closely
related mTORC1 inhibitor, also did not affect the self-renewal
of mammary stem cells (13). These data, therefore, suggest that

Kolev et al.

inhibiting PI3K isoforms, mTORC1, and mTORC2 simultaneously may be important to exert a strong preferential effect on CSC.
This hypothesis was further substantiated by our result that triple
knockdown of PI3Ka, PI3Kb, and mTOR by siRNA showed the
strongest preferential reduction of CSC, whereas knockdown of
PI3Ka, PI3Kb, or mTOR individually did not exert a preferential
effect on CSC (Fig. 4).
Multiple, distinct subpopulations of leukemic stem cells have
previously been identiﬁed (4). In solid tumors, CSC have been
identiﬁed using a variety of markers and functional attributes even
within the same type of cancer, e.g., breast or ovarian cancer.
While these markers may identify overlapping states of CSC, a
more plausible explanation is that CSC are also heterogeneous in
solid tumors. An ideal CSC-targeting agent should optimally
reduce all CSC pools. The PI3K–mTOR dual inhibitor VS-5584
appears to be such an agent, as we have demonstrated that VS5584 reduced CSC based on multiple independent measurements, including Aldeﬂuor, Hoechst-dye exclusion, and CSC
surface markers (CD44hi/CD24lo for breast cancer and CD44hi
/CD117hi for ovarian cancer). Furthermore, VS-5584 also preferentially reduced the proportion of cells with self-renewal potential
as measured by tumorsphere assays and by tumor-initiating
capability following limiting dilution re-implantation of cells
into secondary immunodeﬁcient mice.
Our ﬁndings have implications for the clinical development of
VS-5584. The observation that CSC exhibited 10- to 30- fold
greater sensitivity to VS-5584 than non-CSC (Fig. 1) suggests that
clinical trials designed with CSC-directed endpoints may facilitate
demonstration of efﬁcacy at sub-MTD doses. One such clinical
trial concept is to test VS-5584 in a maintenance setting following
cessation of front-line chemotherapy with survival endpoints,
rather than conventional tumor shrinkage endpoints, which
primarily assess targeting of the bulk tumor burden. Current
ﬁrst-line chemotherapy generally consists of cytotoxic agents,
such as taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel) and platinum agents (e.g., cisplatin). While these agents may effectively debulk tumors and
control disease initially, tumors invariably recur due to ineffective
control of CSC. A CSC-targeting agent is expected to block CSCmediated tumor recurrence. Our results generated using two
SCLC xenograft models (Fig. 6) provide proof-of-concept
that inhibition of PI3K and mTOR kinase activities by VS-5584
after debulking tumors with a cytotoxic agent may substant-

ially extend antitumor response and delay tumor regrowth.
Our ﬁndings thus provide strong rationale for the clinical development of VS-5584, currently in a phase 1 clinical trial
(NCT01991938), for the treatment of cancer with the goal of
achieving more durable responses through the preferential targeting of CSC.
