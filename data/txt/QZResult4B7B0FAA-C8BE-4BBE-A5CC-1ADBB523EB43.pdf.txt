ABSTRACT
Melanoma ranks among the most aggressive and deadly human cancers. Although
a number of targeted therapies are available, they are effective only in a subset of
patients and the emergence of drug resistance often reduces durable responses.
Thus there is an urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets and develop more
potent pharmacological agents for melanoma treatment. Herein we report that SHP2
levels are frequently elevated in melanoma, and high SHP2 expression is significantly
associated with more metastatic phenotype and poorer prognosis. We show that
SHP2 promotes melanoma cell viability, motility, and anchorage-independent growth,
through activation of both ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways. We demonstrate that
SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 effectively blocks SHP2-mediated ERK1/2 and AKT activation and
attenuates melanoma cell viability, migration and colony formation. Most importantly,
SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 suppresses xenografted melanoma tumor growth, as a result of
reduced tumor cell proliferation and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. Taken together,
our data reveal SHP2 as a novel target for melanoma and suggest SHP2 inhibitors as
potential novel therapeutic agents for melanoma treatment.

Several key signaling pathways and molecules
have been implicated in the onset and progression of
melanoma [1–3]. The extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK1/2) pathway, which controls key cellular processes
such as proliferation, invasion, and survival, is frequently
activated in human cancers including melanoma. Mutations
of components in this pathway leading to constitutive
activation of ERK1/2 are often associated with melanoma
development [4]. The PI3K-AKT pathway is also
implicated in melanoma. Constitutive activation of PI3KAKT pathway facilitates melanoma progression, possibly
by enhanced cell survival [5]. Phospho-AKT level increases
dramatically during melanoma progression and invasion
and is inversely correlated with patient survival [6]. Several
growth factor receptors acting upstream of ERK1/2 and
PI3K-AKT cascades are also implicated in melanoma.
For example, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, c-Met, is

INTRODUCTION
Melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes and
ranks among the most common cancers in the United States.
Melanoma is also among the most aggressive human cancers,
with 1- and 2-year survival rates in patients with metastatic
melanoma of ~25% and 10%, respectively, and a median
overall survival of 6 months. New treatments for melanoma
have been developed over the past few years, including a
number of molecular targeted and immunotherapeutic
approaches. However, these targeted approaches are usually
effective only in a subset of patients and the emergence of
drug resistance further reduces durable responses [1]. These
limitations highlight the need for better understanding of the
mechanisms of pathogenesis and acquired drug resistance
in melanoma, identification of new therapeutic target, and
discovery of more potent pharmacological agents.

expressed and activated in melanoma tissues and cell lines
[7]. Overexpression of c-Met is associated with melanoma
progression and metastasis [8, 9], and constitutive activation
of c-Met signaling promotes melanoma metastasis
in mice [10]. Stem cell factor receptor, c-KIT, is an
important receptor tyrosine kinase involved in melanocyte
development, migration, and survival. Melanoma arising
from mucosal, acral, and chronically sun-damaged sites
commonly has amplifications or activating mutations in
KIT [11].
SHP2, encoded by PTPN11, is a protein tyrosine
phosphatase that promotes both ERK1/2 and PI3KAKT signaling [12–15]. Germline mutations in
PTPN11 cause Noonan and LEOPARD syndromes
[16, 17], while somatic mutations in PTPN11 have
been linked to childhood and adult malignancies [18,
19]. Increased SHP2 expression has been recognized
as a prognostic and predictive marker in gastric,
breast, oral, prostate, lung, head and neck, thyroid,
liver and pancreatic cancers [20–28]. Most recently,
SHP2 overexpression and mutations were also found
in melanoma patient samples [29–31]. In addition,
given the obligatory requirement of SHP2 in signaling
pathways mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases,
many of which are up-regulated in melanoma, SHP2
may also be required for melanoma pathogenesis and
progression. In the current study, we provide evidence
that SHP2 promotes melanoma cell viability, motility,
migration and anchorage-independent growth, likely
due to the observed positive regulation of ERK1/2 and
AKT pathways. We demonstrate that a specific SHP2
inhibitor 11a-1 [32] effectively suppresses SHP2’s
positive effects on multiple cellular processes as well
as ERK1/2 and AKT signaling pathways in melanoma
cell. Most importantly, 11a-1 significantly suppresses
xenografted melanoma tumor growth, validating SHP2
as a novel target for melanoma and SHP2 inhibitors as
potential therapeutic avenue for melanoma treatment.

The clinical relevance of SHP2 in melanoma
To explore the clinical significance of SHP2 in
melanoma, we analyzed PTPN11 mRNA level in the
Oncomine database [33, 34]. PTPN11 mRNA level in
cutaneous melanoma appeared higher than that in normal
skin although without statistical significance (p = 0.0558),
probably due to the small sample size for normal skin
tissue (Figure 1A). Notably, when compared to the benign
melanocytic skin nevus, which is commonly viewed as the
precursor of melanoma, PTPN11 mRNA was significantly
up-regulated in melanoma (Figure 1A). We also compared
PTPN11 mRNA level between primary and metastatic
melanoma samples in the skin cutaneous melanoma dataset
in the TCGA database [35, 36]. As shown in Figure 1B,
PTPN11 mRNA is significantly elevated in metastatic
melanoma versus primary melanoma. Most importantly,
the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis for patients in this
dataset revealed that the high PTPN11 mRNA expression
group showed significantly shorter overall survival time
compared to the low PTPN11 mRNA group, with a median
survival of 24.03 months versus 35.67 months (Figure 1C).
Collectively, these clinical data suggest that SHP2 may
play a role in melanoma onset and progression, and thus
targeting SHP2 may be beneficial for melanoma treatment.

SHP2 promotes melanoma cell viability, motility
and anchorage-independent growth
Although SHP2 expression is elevated in melanoma,
the role of SHP2 in melanoma is unknown. To investigate
the biological function of SHP2 in melanoma, we firstly
examined the effect of SHP2 modulation on melanoma
cell viability. To this end, we either overexpressed or
knocked down SHP2 in MeWo melanoma cells and
measured the cell viability by the MTT assay. As shown

as mean±SD. B. PTPN11 mRNA is further elevated in metastatic melanoma versus primary melanoma. Data are shown as mean±SD.

in Figure 2A, SHP2 overexpression increased cell
viability by ~30% and SHP2 knockdown decreased that
by ~20%. To gain insights into the positive role of SHP2
in melanoma cell viability, we examined the proliferation
marker PCNA and apoptosis marker cleaved PARP after
SHP2 overexpression or knockdown in MeWo cells
(Figure 2B). PCNA was increased and cleaved PARP was
reduced in SHP2 overexpressed cells. Conversely, PCNA
was decreased and cleaved PARP was increased in SHP2
knockdown cells. Together, the data indicates that SHP2
promotes melanoma cell viability through enhancing cell
proliferation and suppressing apoptosis. To strengthen
this conclusion, SHP2 overexpression or knockdown
MeWo cells were stained with Hoechst and anti-Ki67
antibody, and the Ki67-positive cells were visualized and
analyzed by an ArrayScan high-content screening system.

Consistently, the number of Ki67-positive cells increased
following SHP2 overexpression and decreased after SHP2
knockdown (Figure 2C).
Increased cell motility is one of the defining
characteristics of invasive tumors and is crucial to
tumor invasion and metastasis [37]. To assess the
effect of SHP2 on melanoma cell motility, MeWo cells
overexpressing SHP2 or vector control were stained
with Hoechst and monitored by an ArrayScan highcontent screening system. Compared to vector control,
SHP2 overexpression clearly increased the mean
moving distance of melanoma cells at the same time
point (Figure 2D) and led to ~1.4-fold increase in the
mean speed of cell movement by the end of 4 hours
observation window (Figure 2E). We also carried out
wound healing experiment to further evaluate the effect

of SHP2 on cell motility. As shown in Figure 2F and
2G, SHP2 overexpression sped up MeWo cell migration
by 1.6 folds, whereas SHP2 knockdown slowed down
MeWo cell migration by 30%.
Anchorage-independent growth is a hallmark of
oncogenic transformation and a key characteristic of
cancer cells [38], and the in vitro anchorage-independent
growth of cancer cells has been connected with tumor
cell aggressiveness in vivo such as tumorigenic and
metastatic potentials [39]. Thus we also investigated
the effect of SHP2 on anchorage-independent growth
of MeWo cell using colony formation assay. Compared
to vector control, larger and 45% more colonies were
observed in SHP2 overexpressing melanoma cells
(Figure 2H). Collectively, the above results indicate that
SHP2 promotes melanoma cell viability, motility, and
anchorage-independent growth.

positive role in promoting ERK1/2 and AKT pathways in
MeWo melanoma cells.

SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 reduces melanoma cell
viability, motility, and anchorage-independent
growth
Given the observed positive role of SHP2 in
promoting melanoma cell viability, motility, anchorageindependent growth, as well as ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT
pathway activation, we speculated that pharmacological
inhibition of SHP2 could counteract these positive effects
thereby benefit melanoma treatment. Thus we used a
potent and specific SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 [32] to validate
the potential of targeting SHP2 for melanoma treatment.
We first evaluated 11a-1’s cellular effect on melanoma cell
viability by the MTT assay. As shown in Figure 4A, 11a1 dose-dependently inhibits MeWo cell viability with an
EC50 of 4.2 μM and a maximum inhibition of ~70%, but a
structurally-related, inactive analog 10c [32] did not show
any inhibition up to 20 μM, indicating that 11a-1 suppress
melanoma cell viability through inhibiting SHP2. Similar
inhibitory effect for 11a-1 on cell viability was also
observed in a mouse melanoma cell line B16F10, with
an EC50 of 5.1 μM and a maximum inhibition of ~95%
(Supplementary Figure S1A). To further ascertain target
engagement by 11a-1, we also determined the effect of
11a-1 on NIH 3T3 cell line which is non-tumorigenic and
with significantly lower SHP2 expression in comparison
to that in MeWo cell (Supplementary Figure S2A). As
shown in Supplementary Figure S2B, the EC50 value
of 11a-1 on NIH 3T3 cell viability (49.8 ± 5.2 μM)
is more than 10 fold higher than that on MeWo cells,
indicating that 11a-1 shows less toxicity to normal cells.
To further consolidate the target engagement of SHP2,
we evaluated two additional SHP2 inhibitors, one is a
structurally-related active site-directed SHP2 inhibitor
IIB08 (IC50 = 5.5 μM) [42], and the other is a structurallyunrelated SHP2 inhibitor SHP099 (IC50 = 0.07 μM) with
a different mode of action, namely allosteric inhibition,
reported most recently by Novartis [43]. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S2C and S2D, IIB08 and SHP099
dose-dependently inhibit MeWo cell viability and SHP2
mediated ERK1/2 activation. Collectively, these results
indicate that 11a-1 inhibits MeWo cell viability through
specifically inhibiting SHP2 mediated signaling pathways.
We further examined whether 11a-1 can neutralize
SHP2’s positive effect on other cellular processes. MeWo
cells treated with vehicle or 11a-1 were stained by Hoechst
and anti-Ki67 antibody, visualized by an ArrayScan highcontent screening system and the Ki67-positive ratio was
calculated to quantify cell proliferation. 11a-1 decreases
the Ki67-positive ratio by 12% and 26% respectively
at 10 and 20 μM, showing a dose-dependent inhibition
on cell proliferation (Figure 4B). To assess the effect of
SHP2 inhibition on cell motility, we treated MeWo cells

SHP2 positively regulates ERK1/2 and PI3K/
AKT pathway in melanoma cells
ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT are the two major signal
pathways implicated in melanoma pathogenesis and
progression [2], and SHP2 is a recognized positive
regulator of Ras, which activates both pathways [12–15].
Thus, we examined the effect of SHP2 on both ERK1/2 and
PI3K-AKT pathways in MeWo cells. As shown in Figure
3A, compared to the vector control, ERK1/2 activation is
significantly enhanced in SHP2 overexpression cells. We
then assessed the phosphorylation of Paxllin (Y118), a
physiological substrate of SHP2 required for Src activation
[40]. SHP2 promotes the activation of Src family kinases
through dephosphorylation of Paxillin (Y118), thereby
preventing Csk from phosphorylating the C-terminal
inhibitory Tyr527 in Src kinase [40, 41]. As expected, the
pPaxillin (Y118) and pSrc (Y527) levels are decreased
in SHP2 overexpressed cells, thereby contributing to
ERK1/2 activation. SHP2 overexpression also promotes
AKT activation, leading to enhanced phosphorylation
of the downstream S6K which might contribute to the
positive role of SHP2 on cell proliferation. To consolidate
the above effects of SHP2 on both ERK1/2 and AKT
signal pathways, we also determined the effects of SHP2
knockdown in MeWo cells. As expected, both pPaxillin
(Y118) and pSrc (Y527) are elevated, and ERK1/2, AKT
and S6K activation are diminished when SHP2 level is
reduced (Figure 3B). Since c-Met is a receptor tyrosine
kinase involved in melanoma [7, 8, 10], we further
evaluated whether SHP2 could affect aforementioned
signals upon HGF stimulation (Figure 3C). As expected,
SHP2 knockdown diminishes the dephosphorylation of
Paxillin pY118 and Src pY527, and attenuates ERK1/2,
AKT and S6K activation after HGF stimulation, and the
alterations on these signaling molecules are more obvious
compared to those without HGF stimulation in Figure
3B. Collectively, these results reveal that SHP2 plays a

with vehicle or 11a-1, stained cell nucleus with Hoechst
and monitored the mean moving distance of cells by an
ArrayScan high-content screening system. As shown in
Figure 4C, 11a-1 treatment dose-dependently shortens
the mean moving distance of MeWo cells. The mean
speed by the end of the experiments (6 hours duration)
was calculated and normalized to vehicle treatment, and
11a-1 was found to reduce the mean speed by 12% and
23% respectively at 10 and 20 μM (Figure 4D). Similar
inhibitory effects were also observed in B16F10 cells
(Supplementary Figure S1B & S1C). We then proceeded
to evaluate the effect of 11a-1 on cell migration by wound
healing assay. As show in Figure 4E, 11a-1 slows down
MeWo cell migration by ~25% and ~33% respectively at
10 and 20 μM. Finally, we examined the effects of 11a-1
on anchorage-independent growth of melanoma cells. As
expected, 11a-1 effectively inhibits MeWo cell anchorageindependent growth in a dose dependent manner, and
almost completely blocks colony formation at 20 μM,
while the negative control compound 10c barely shows

any inhibition even at 20 μM (Figure 4F). This same
inhibitory effect on anchorage-independent growth by
11a-1 was also observed with the mouse melanoma cell
B16F10 (Supplementary Figure S1D). Collectively, the
results indicated that pharmacological inhibition of SHP2
by 11a-1 can effectively inhibit melanoma cell viability,
motility, and anchorage-independent growth, confirming
the therapeutic potential of targeting SHP2 for melanoma
treatment at cellular level.

11a-1 attenuates SHP2-mediated signaling
pathways in melanoma cell
To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying the
mode of action of 11a-1 in melanoma cells, we performed
Western blot analyses to evaluate its effects on SHP2
relevant signaling pathways. The data shows that 11a-1
decreases PCNA and increases cleaved PARP level 2 and
5.5 fold after cells were treated with 10 and 20 M 11a-1
for one day (Figure 5A), consistent with 11a-1’s ability to

suppress cell proliferation and induce apoptosis. Moreover,
we also ascertained the effect of 11a-1 on SHP2-mediated
ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathway activation in MeWo cell.
As shown in Figure 5B, 11a-1 dose-dependently augments
the phosphorylation of Paxillin(Y118) and Src(Y527)
and inhibits HGF-induced ERK1/2 activation. 11a-1 also
inhibits AKT activation and consequently causes inhibition
of downstream S6K activation. However, the inhibition
of ERK1/2 and AKT activation were not observed after
the negative control compound 10c treatment at 20 μM
(Figure 5C), indicating target engagement of SHP2 in the
signal transduction. Again, similar results were observed
in B16F10 cells. 11a-1 inhibits HGF-induced ERK1/2 and
AKT activation, but 10c shows no appreciable inhibition up

to 20 μM (Supplementary Figure S3). Overall the data nicely
showed that pharmacological inhibition of SHP2 by 11a-1
phenocopied SHP2 knockdown.

11a-1 suppresses melanoma xenograft tumor
growth
Given the observed promising activity of 11a-1 in
blocking SHP2-mediated signaling in cell-based assays,
we wanted to provide further proof-of-concept for
targeting SHP2 for melanoma treatment. Pharmacokinetic
(PK) analysis of plasma samples from a cohort of three
mice collected at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 24 hr post-intraperitoneal
(IP) injection of 11a-1 showed that 11a-1 displayed a very

respectable PK profile with a maximum plasma compound
exposure Cmax= 0.6 μM at 1 hr and a half-life t1/2=9.5 hr at
a 10 mg/kg single dose (Supplementary Figure S4). Given
the 11a-1’s excellent PK properties, we evaluated the
efficacy of 11a-1 on melanoma tumor growth in vivo using
a xenograft mouse model. MeWo cells were injected into
one flank of each mouse, and the mice with grown tumors
were randomly assigned to either a vehicle control group
or an 11a-1 treatment group. Mice received IP injection of
vehicle (DMSO) or 11a-1 (15 mg/kg) once daily, and the
tumor growth was monitored for three weeks. As shown
in Figure 6A, tumors in the vehicle-treated group progress
steadily during the course of treatment, while tumor
growth in 11a-1-treated group is significantly inhibited
starting from the seventh day, and the average tumor
volume is reduced 52% at day 21 compared to vehicle
control. During the treatment period, the body weight of
mice in both groups remained the same, indicating that
11a-1 was well tolerated with no obvious toxicity (Figure
6B). The mice were sacrificed after 21-day treatment, and
the tumors were harvested and weighed. Tumors in the
11a-1 treatment group are significantly smaller than those
in vehicle control group (Figure 6C). Correspondingly, the
tumor weight in 11a-1 group is also significantly reduced
(Figure 6D). To study the effects of 11a-1 on SHP2mediated signaling pathways in vivo, tumor samples were
lysed and analyzed by Western blot. Consistent with the
observations in cultured MeWo cells, 11a-1 treatment leads

to decreased pERK1/2 and pAKT level in xenograft tumor
samples (Figure 6E). Moreover, the immunohistochemical
analyses of tumor samples revealed that 11a-1 treatment
reduced Ki67 level and elevated cleaved PARP level
(Figure 6F), indicating that 11a-1 attenuated tumor cell
proliferation and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis in vivo.
We also evaluated the anti-melanoma effect of 11a-1 in
syngeneic B16F10 melanoma xenograft mice, and found
that 11a-1 significantly reduced melanoma xenograft
tumor weight, as well as pERK1/2 and pAKT level in
B16F10 melanoma xenograft tumor tissue (Supplementary
Figure S5). Collectively, our results provide the first proofof-concept for the therapeutic potential of targeting SHP2
for melanoma treatment.

DISCUSSION
During the past decade, great progress in targeted
therapies and immunotherapies was made for melanoma
treatment. However, the extension of life achieved by these
agents is only several months due to the rapid occurrence
of drug resistance [44]. Moreover, treatment for metastatic
melanoma, which is linked with a poor patient prognosis,
still remains limited. Melanoma progression involves
a complex series of events, including malfunction of
many signaling pathways and key oncogenic molecules.

that might be crucial for clinical applications are likely to
lead to more effective treatment strategies for melanoma.
SHP2 plays important roles in cell proliferation,
migration, cell transformation, angiogenesis, and survival.
SHP2 is a key signal-transducer acting downstream of most
receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR, FGFR, c-MET,
Kit, PDGFR, and insulin receptor, and positively regulates
Ras/ERK1/2, PI3K/AKT, JAK/STAT, JNK, FAK, NF-κB,
and Wnt signaling pathways [12–15, 45]. Noticeably,
some of the growth factor receptors and signaling
pathways modulated by SHP2 are also implicated in
melanoma pathogenesis, suggesting that SHP2 might play
a role in melanoma onset or progression. To substantiate
this speculation, we performed bioinformatics analyses
and found that SHP2 mRNA level is elevated in melanoma
compared to its precursor nevus. Moreover, high SHP2
expression is significantly associated with more metastatic
phenotype and poorer prognosis, and the survival time
of patients with high SHP2 level is substantially shorter
than those with low SHP2 level. The correlation between
SHP2 expression and clinicopathological characteristics
implicates a potential role of SHP2 in melanoma. In
addition, given the obligatory requirement of SHP2 in
receptor tyrosine kinase pathways, inhibition of SHP2 is
expected to have therapeutic applications in a wide range
of cancers including melanoma.
To disclose the role of SHP2 in melanoma
pathogenesis and explore the potential of targeting SHP2
for melanoma treatment, we first assessed the biological
function of SHP2 in melanoma by overexpressing
or knocking down SHP2 in MeWo cells. We found

that SHP2 is a positive regulator of both ERK1/2 and
AKT signaling, and promotes melanoma cell viability,
anchorage-independent growth, and migration which
are key characteristics in cancer cells progression and
metastasis. These observations suggest that SHP2 acts
as an oncogene involved in melanoma progression and
metastasis, and support the notion that SHP2 may serve
as a novel and promising target for melanoma treatment.
Thereby, we proceeded to evaluate the effects of a small
molecule SHP2 inhibitor 11a-1 on melanoma in cell
culture and in vivo. Treatment of MeWo and B16F10
metastatic melanoma cell lines with 11a-1 effectively
blocks SHP2-mediated ERK1/2 and AKT activation and
attenuates cell viability, anchorage-independent growth,
and migration. Most importantly, 11a-1 significantly
suppresses melanoma xenograft tumor growth, at least
through reducing tumor cell proliferation and enhancing
apoptosis. Our results validate SHP2 as a novel target
for melanoma and suggest pharmacological inhibition of
SHP2 could be highly effective therapeutic approach for
melanoma treatment.
Finally, SHP2 plays important roles in several
cellular processes, and there is a large body of literature
implicating SHP2 as a bona fide oncoprotein. Moreover,
since SHP2 is directly downstream of receptor tyrosine
kinases, targeting the growth factor pathways at the
level of SHP2 might offer unique advantages in receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance settings. This is of
particular interest since several of the currently proposed
drug resistance mechanisms against melanoma, through
upregulation of C-Raf [46], B-Raf [47], hepatocyte growth

factor [48] or PDGFR [49], reactivate the signaling
pathways which are mediated by SHP2. Indeed, a recent
study indicates that SHP2 is a central node in intrinsic
and acquired resistance to tyrosine kinase targeted cancer
drugs [50]. However whether pharmacologic inhibition of
SHP2 represents an effective approach for cancer therapy
remains an outstanding question. Results from this study
together with early reports [32, 51, 52] provide strong
evidence that specific inhibitors of SHP2 can be effective
anti-tumor agents. Future studies will investigate whether
SHP2 inhibitors alone or in combination with kinase
inhibitors can prevent or prolong the development of
cancer drug resistance.

Laboratories). Then DNA staining with 5μg/mL Hoechst
(Sigma) for another 15min was used for identification
of cell nuclei. After washing with PBS, each well was
filled with PBS. The fraction of Ki67 possitive cells
were quantified by high content immunofluorescence
microscope (Arrayscan™ XTI Infinity High Content
Platform). In immunofluorescence analysis assessing the
effect of 11a-1 on cell proliferation, cells were treated
with 11a-1 or DMSO for 1 day before being fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde contained PBS.

The Liquid Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry
(LC/MS) analysis was carried out on a Agilent 1200
analytic HPLC system and an Agilent 6130 Quadrupole
MS detector, equipped with a Phenomenex Kinetex 2.6u
XB-C18 column (2.5 μm, 4.6 mm X 50 mm), eluted
with 0-100% MeOH-H2O with 0.1% (w/v) ammonium
bicarbonate at 0.8 mL/min flow-rate (gradient method:
9.0 min 0-90% MeOH linear gradient, followed by 3 min
90-100% MeOH, followed by 3 min 100% MeOH), MS
detector were set at single ion mode (SIM), monitoring the
negative charge 636 (M-1). The detection limit for 11a-1 is
50 nM at 2 μl sample injection.

Wound healing assay
The uniform scratches were created using silicon
culture inserts (Ibidi, Germany) with two individual
wells for cell seeding according to the manufacturer’s
instruction. After removing the inserts, cells were
washed to remove the floating cells, and fresh medium
containing 5% FBS was added. The photos were captured
by EVOS FL cell imaging system (Life Technologies) at
the indicated time points. The wound area was measured
using MRI wound healing tool in Image J software, and
the relative migration was calculated as described by Xia
et al [53]: measure the initial wound area at 0 h as A0
and the area at time point i as Ai, then the cell migration
area at time point i is defined as Amigration(i) = Ai − A0, and
the relative migration shown in Figures was calculated
by normalizing the Amigration(i) for SHP2 versus vector
overexpression cells (Figure 2F), or SHP2 siRNA versus
scramble siRNA transfected cells (Figure 2G). In wound
healing assay assessing the effect of 11a-1 on migration,
11a-1 or DMSO were added to fresh medium containing
5% FBS.

Tumor xenograft experiments
NSG (NOD/scid/IL2Rgnull) mice were purchased
from In Vivo Therapeutics Core of the Indiana University
Simon Cancer Center. Xenograft experiments were
performed in compliance with the relevant laws and
guidelines set forth by the Institutional Laboratory
Animal Care and Use Committee of Indiana University.
All mice were housed under pathogen-free conditions
in the animal facility and received autoclaved water and
food. 10-12 weeks old NSG mice were used in the study.
MeWo cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) at 8×107 cells/ml. A total of 8×106 cells (100 μl)
were subcutaneously implanted into both left and right
flank using a 27-gauge needle. Tumor size was measured
with calipers. Tumor volume (V) was determined by the
equation V = (L × W2) × 0.5, in which L is the length
and W is the width of the tumor. When tumors reached
volumes of ~200 mm3, the mice showing tumors were
randomly assigned to a control group and an 11a-1 group,
and daily intraperitoneal injection of either vehicle or 15
mg/kg 11a-1 was performed, and the tumor growth was
monitored for 3 weeks. Mice were sacrificed after injection
for 21 days, and tumors were removed, weighted, as well
as subjected to immunohistological and biochemical
analysis.

Soft agar colony formation assay
Cells were suspended in 0.3% agar containing
medium and plated on a layer of 0.6% agar in medium
in 12-well culture plates. After incubation for 4 weeks
(Figure 2H) or 6 weeks (Figure 4F), colonies were
stained with crystal violet and scanned with a scanner, the
numbers of colonies and the percentage of colony-covered
area were counted using Image J software.

Immunohistochemistry analysis

Animal dosing and sample collection for
pharmacokinetic studies

Harvested tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
overnight at 4°C, embedded in paraffin, serially sectioned
(7 μm), de-paraffined sections were incubated with
diluted antibodies at 4°C overnight. Signals were detected
by VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit and developed using
DAB substrate from Vector laboratory (Burlingame,
CA). All the antibodies used were from Cell Signaling
Technology. Images were captured on a Leica DM2500
stereomicroscope.

Three mice were administered a single IP dose of
11a-1 at 10 mg/kg. At different time points (1 hour, 3
hours, 6 hours, 9 hours and 24 hours), blood samples (50
μl) from each mouse were collected and mixed with EDTA
(50 mM, 50 μl). The samples were then mixed with 200
μl acetonitrile and centrifuged at 21,100 g for 5 minutes.
The supernatants were collected and subjected to liquid
chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis.

In clinical relevance study of SHP2 in melanoma, the
data was downloaded from Oncomine or TCGA database.
The Student’s t-test was used to assess the significance
of differences between groups. Survival analysis was
performed according to the Kaplan-Meier method and the
log-rank test was used to assess the significance. For all
cell-based assays, each experiment was repeated for 2~3
times, the representative result was shown in figures, the
bar chart represented mean value ± standard deviation, and
the Student’s t-test was used to measure the significance.
In xenograft tumors experiments, tumor volumes at
different time point, as well as final tumor weights were
compared between 11a-1 and vehicle treated group, the
statistical significance was evaluated using the Student’s
t-test. In all statistical analysis, p-value less than 0.05
was considered statistically significant, and the statistical
significance were represented in figures as * (p < 0.05), **
(p < 0.01) or *** (p < 0.005).
