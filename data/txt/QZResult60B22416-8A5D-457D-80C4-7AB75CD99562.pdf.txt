ABSTRACT
Background: The thiosemicarbazone CD 02750 (VLX50) was recently reported as
a hit compound in a phenotype-based drug screen in primary cultures of patient tumor
cells. We synthesized a copper complex of VLX50, denoted VLX60, and characterized
its antitumor and mechanistic properties.
Materials and Methods: The cytotoxic effects and mechanistic properties of VLX60
were investigated in monolayer cultures of multiple human cell lines, in tumor cells
from patients, in a 3-D spheroid cell culture system and in vivo and were compared
with those of VLX50.
Results: VLX60 showed ≥ 3-fold higher cytotoxic activity than VLX50 in 2-D
cultures and, in contrast to VLX50, retained its activity in the presence of additional
iron. VLX60 was effective against non-proliferative spheroids and against tumor
xenografts in vivo in a murine model. In contrast to VLX50, gene expression analysis
demonstrated that genes associated with oxidative stress were considerably enriched
in cells exposed to VLX60 as was induction of reactive oxygen. VLX60 compromised
the ubiquitin-proteasome system and was more active in BRAF mutated versus BRAF
wild-type colon cancer cells.
Conclusions: The cytotoxic effects of the copper thiosemicarbazone VLX60 differ
from those of VLX50 and shows interesting features as a potential antitumor drug,
notably against BRAF mutated colorectal cancer.

INTRODUCTION

However, more recent data show that redox effects of
iron complexes of thiosemicarbazones on these enzymes
and anticancer effects through targeting of a number of
other molecules, including NDRG1 and top2α, might
also be important [7, 8, 11, 12]. Triapine and another
novel thiosemicarbazone, DpC (Dp4cycH4mT), are
currently in phase I and II clinical trials [13–15] (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02688101) and other
thiosemicarbazones, e.g. Dp44mT and Bp44mT, have
shown potent antitumor activity in tumor xenografts
in mice [16]. However, clinical trials with triapine
demonstrated poor activity and side effects such as
myelosuppression, hypoxia and methemoglobinemia

Thiosemicarbazones have been explored as
antitumor agents since several decades and a number
of compounds in this drug family have shown
promising antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo
[1–8]. Triapine (3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde
thiosemicarbazone) is the most comprehensively studied
anticancer thiosemicarbazone and has been described
as a potent inhibitor of iron containing enzymes such as
ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and p53R2 [8–10]. The
inhibitory effect of triapine was previously thought to
be due to the direct removal of Fe from the enzymes.

[13–15]. An altered design of the ligand has been proposed
as a way forward for this class of anticancer drugs [15].
It is well known that the formation of copper
complexes of mono- and bis-thiosemicarbazones has been
associated with several fold increased antitumor activity
in vitro and in vivo [8, 17–22] and it was shown already in
the 1960s that a powerful antitumor bis-thiosemicarbazone
required nutrient copper for its activity in a rodent model
[21, 23]. The success of the platinum anticancer drugs has
stimulated research on metal-based drugs and the fact that a
number of copper complexes have shown a broad spectrum
of antitumor activities has fueled the interest to develop
copper complexes as anticancer agents [18, 22, 24, 25].
Interestingly, copper complexes have also been suggested
to be able to overcome platinum resistance [17, 18, 22,
24, 26]. However, little is known about their mechanisms
of action and most investigations focus on the interaction
with DNA [22]. Early studies with copper chelates
of thiosemicarbazones indicated the ability of these
compounds to induce cell death associated with generation
of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and depletion of cellular
glutathione [17, 19], but few papers report on the effects
on intracellular signal transduction [22]. To the best of our
knowledge no copper-thiosemicarbazone complex has
thus far entered clinical trials. However, a phase I clinical
trial (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00742911)
of a copper mixture based on co-administration of copper
gluconate and disulfiram for the treatment of refractory
solid tumors was recently completed and at least two other
phase I-II studies, utilizing this copper combination, are
planned in glioblastoma but not yet recruiting (https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01777919 and https://
clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02715609).
We recently reported on the identification of the
thiosemicarbazone 3‐(3‐methoxypropyl)‐1‐[[(pyridin‐2‐
yl)methylidene]amino]thiourea (CD 02750, subsequently
denoted VLX50) (Figure 1A) as a hit in a phenotypebased drug screen and found it to be active against ovarian
carcinoma cells both in vitro and in vivo [5]. Confirmed
by a series of experiments this drug was shown to
deplete intracellular iron, leading to hypoxia signaling.
In the present study, our aim was to develop VLX50
and rationally design a more potent drug with enhanced
anticancer activity and explore its mechanism of action.
Therefore, we synthesized a copper complex (Copper(II)
chloride complex of 3‐(3‐methoxypropyl)‐1‐[[(pyridin‐2‐

yl)methylidene]amino]thiourea) of VLX50 (the copper
complex subsequently denoted VLX60; Figure 1B) and
investigated its antitumor and mechanistic properties in
various models, including xenografts in mice.
Since in the initial experiments VLX60 was found
most active against a cell line from colon cancer we
included colon cancer models able to associate the activity
to the KRAS and BRAF mutation status, established to
have predictive and/or prognostic importance in this tumor
type [27, 28]. Mechanistic properties were explored using
gene expression analysis of drug exposed tumor cells.
Since proteasome inhibition has emerged as a putative
target for copper complexes we also evaluated the effect
of VLX60 on the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
[22, 29–32]. Important general features of cytotoxic
drugs such as effects on cell proliferation, cell cycle, and
apoptosis were assessed.

RESULTS
Drug activity in monolayer cultured cell lines
The cytotoxic effect of VLX50 and VLX60 was
investigated in 6 different cancer cell lines of various
origins (Figure 2A–2B). All cell lines were more sensitive
to VLX60 than VLX50. The three kidney cancer cell
lines ACHN, Caki-2 and 786-O as well as the ovarian
cancer cell line A2780 were highly resistant to VLX50. In
contrast, all cell lines showed steep drops in cell viability
well below 10 μM VLX60. For both drugs, the colon
cancer cell line HCT116 was the most sensitive cell line.
Given the high activity of VLX50 and VLX60
against the colon cancer cell line HCT116, which is KRAS
mutated, the activity of these drugs was compared in
three pairs of colon cancer cell lines with different KRAS
and BRAF mutation status (Figure 2C–2H and Table 1).
The parental cells harbor KRAS or BRAF mutations that
are knocked out (KO) in the KRAS/BRAF sublines. The
activity of VLX50 was significantly higher in DLD cells
with wt status of KRAS (DLD KRAS (+/−) compared to
cells with one mutant allele of the gene (DLD). However,
KRAS mutation status in HCT116 cells as well as BRAF
mutation status in RKO cells did not affect the response to
VLX50. For VLX60 the activity was essentially unaffected
by KRAS status whereas, interestingly, the RKO cells
with mutant BRAF were statistically significantly more

than 2-fold more sensitive than the RKO cells with KO
of mutant BRAF. All six cell lines were more sensitive
to VLX60 compared with VLX50. IC50 for VLX50 and
VLX60 were 7.3 μM and 2.3 μM, respectively, in the
parental HCT116 cells (Figure 2C–2D and Table 1).
In serum free medium, the relative difference
in efficacy between the drugs remained essentially
unchanged, indicating that their different potency is
not due to various protein binding. However, the IC50
concentrations were approximately 2.5 fold lower than in
the serum containing standard medium (not shown).
The activity of VLX60 was not obviously
associated with p53 status, as shown by the nearly
identical survival curves irrespective of KO of p53 in
HCT116 cells (Figure 2I).
The effect of VLX50 and VLX60 was tested against
a cell line derived from normal colon cells and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells and compared with the effect
against HCT116 cells. For both drugs, the colon cancer
cell line HCT116 was more sensitive than cells from the
normal cell line, but VLX60 was more active against the
normal mononuclear cells compared with the tumor cells,
which was not observed with VLX50 (Online Resource,
Supplementary Figure 2).

exposure to VLX60. This is demonstrated in Figure 3,
where in addition to a lower fluorescence signal also a
partial dissociation of 6 day-old spheroids is evident after
exposure to 50 µM VLX60.

Activity in tumor cells from patients
Given the differential activity of both VLX50 and
VLX60 against the HCT116 colon cancer cell lines vs.
the other cell lines tested, the activity of these drugs was
assessed in tumor cells from patients with colorectal cancer
and compared with cells from patients with acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), ovarian or kidney cancer (Figure 4A–4B).
Similar patterns of VLX50 and VLX60 activity were
demonstrated in the four malignancies with AML cells
being the most sensitive, followed by ovarian, colon- and
kidney cancer cells. Importantly, VLX60 showed a ≥ 40fold higher cytotoxic activity than VLX50 (Figure 4A–4B,
IC50-values not shown). Thus, although the activity
pattern in the patient cells did not fully correspond to that
in the cell lines, the relative effect of VLX60 compared
to VLX50 was higher in tumor cells from patients than
in the cell lines. As shown in Table 2 and Figure 4C–4D
VLX60 exhibited a trend towards enhanced activity against
both KRAS and BRAF mutated tumor cells from patients
with colorectal cancer although the difference was not
statistically significant (KRAS and BRAF mutation status
was only available in 16 patient samples).

Activity in 3-D spheroid cell culture
VLX50 and VLX60 activity was then examined in a
multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) model, considered
to better reflect the solid tumor in vivo with respect to drug
penetration, cell interactions, gene expression, hypoxia
and nutrient gradients compared with monolayer cultured
cells [33–35]. Both VLX50 and VLX60 were active in 3
day-old spheroids, although VLX50 was 4-fold less potent
(Figure 3). Whereas 6 day-old spheroids were completely
resistant to VLX50 at up to 50 µM, VLX60 exhibited an
IC50 of less than 30 µM in this non-proliferative and very
resistant tumor model. Fluorescence imaging revealed a
clearly visible effect on 3- and 6 day-old spheroids after

Gene expression analysis
The most substantial finding from the Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) was that genes associated
with oxidative stress were substantially enriched in cells
exposed to VLX60 compared with VLX50 (Figure 5A–5B).
Among 4 431 a priori defined gene sets, the gene set
“Chuang oxidative stress response up” exhibited the
highest enrichment score for VLX60 (Figure 5A).
Furthermore, in accordance with earlier published results

[5], the GSEA showed that genes associated with HIF1
signaling were induced by exposure to VLX50, as opposed
to VLX60 (Figure 5C–5D). This hypoxia response
associated with VLX50 treatment has been shown to be
consistent with iron chelation as mechanism of action [5].

with the same concentrations of VLX50 (not shown).
Both VLX50 and VLX60 induced early ROS formation
other than superoxide as judged by the assessment of the
Oxidative Stress Detection Reagent in HCT116 cells after
2 h (Figure 6B). The oxidative stress inducer pyocyanin was
included as positive control and induced ROS formation
to a lesser degree than the experimental drugs, probably
explained by a relatively low concentration of pyocyanin
in a higher concentration of dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO)
(known to inhibit ROS formation). The ROS inhibitor
N-acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed induction of ROS
formation in cells treated with VLX50, VLX60 or positive
control (Figure 6B). Pre-incubation with the ROS inhibitor
NAC resulted in a right-shift of the concentration-response
curve for both VLX50 and VLX60 (Figure 6C–6D) whereas
NAC interacted with CuCl2 to induce cell death (Figure 6E).
Whereas there was no sign of accumulation of the
UPS substrate UbG76V-YFP after exposure to VLX50 (not
shown), exposure to VLX60 produced an increase in
fluorescence after 24 h, similar to bortezomib, a known
proteasome inhibitor (Figure 6F).

after exposure to VLX60, although less than from the

Cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis

Copper complexes of thiosemicarbazones are known
for their redox-active properties and the induction of cell
death by these compounds has been associated with a
broad spectrum of mechanisms [8, 17–22]. The ability of
copper chelates of thiosemicarbazones to induce cell death
associated with generation of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and depletion of cellular glutathione was described
early [17, 19]. However, most investigations of copper
complexes have focused on the interaction with DNA
[22]. Little is still known about the mechanisms of action
and effects on intracellular signal transduction of copper
complexes [22], although organelles such as the proteasome
are emerging as new putative targets [22, 29–32].
Furthermore, copper complexes have been suggested to be
able to overcome platinum resistance [17, 18, 22, 24, 26].
Although these interesting features of copper complexes of
thiosemicarbazones have not yet materialized in the clinic
and no copper complex of a thiosemicarbazone has thus
far been approved for use against cancer, the interest in the
development of copper complexes as anticancer agents has
rapidly grown in the last decade [22].
The results presented here show that the copper
complex VLX60 has properties worthy of further
evaluation and is mechanistically different from the original
compound VLX50. Firstly, VLX60 showed ≥ 3-fold higher
cytotoxic activity than VLX50 in 2-D cultures from cell
lines (Figure 2 and Table 1). This difference in activity
was substantially more pronounced in tumor cells from
patients (Figure 4). Also, the retained effect in the resistant
spheroid model (Figure 3), makes VLX60 a promising
drug candidate for further evaluation in solid tumors since
three-dimensional cell cultures are thought to better reflect
the situation in vivo in cancer patients with respect to drug
interaction, cell-cell interactions, hypoxia and nutrient
gradients in the tumor [33–35].
Next, we included colon cancer models able to
associate the activity to the KRAS- and BRAF mutation
status, established to have predictive and/or prognostic
importance in this tumor type [27, 28]. The activity of
VLX60 was significantly higher in RKO cells with mutant
BRAF (Figure 2H and Table 1). The impact of a drug that
could selectively target BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer
would be of great clinical benefit, since BRAF-mutation is
associated with a poor prognosis and drug resistance [28].
Interestingly, VLX60 exhibited a trend towards specific
activity against both KRAS- and BRAF mutated tumor
cells from patients with colorectal cancer (Figure 4C–4D
and Table 2). Thus, further evaluation of VLX60 in BRAF
mutated colorectal cancer is warranted.

Cell cycle analysis after 24 h exposure revealed no
substantial difference between the two compounds; both
accumulated cells in S and G2/M phases (Figure 6G). After 6
h drug exposure, VLX50 compared with VLX60 accumulated
more cells in G1 (Online Resource, Supplementary Figure
4). Figure 6H confirms the equipotency of the VLX50 and
VLX60 concentrations chosen for the various experiments
as they inhibited cell proliferation up to 24 h to the same
extent. After 24 h the number of cells available for analysis
decreases, as a sign of cell death.
Both VLX50 and VLX60 induced apoptosis after
48 h at concentrations close to IC50-values (10 µM
and 2 µM respectively), as judged by analysis of
activated caspase-3/7 (Figure 6I–6J). VLX60 at higher
concentrations (10 and 50 µM) elicited an almost
immediate activation of caspase-3/7 in contrast to VLX50
(not shown). However, exposure to VLX60 at these higher
concentrations was associated with a complete cell death
already at 24h (not shown).

Antitumor activity of VLX60 in xenograft model
The antitumor activity of VLX60 was explored in
HCT116 GFP xenograft tumors in mice. Figure 7 shows
that 0.6 mg/kg/day VLX60 inhibited tumor growth
(p < 0.05) after 28 days, compared to control. In contrast,
0.4 mg/kg/day VLX60 did not significantly inhibit tumor
growth (p > 0.05) after 28 days (Figure 7). VLX60 was
well tolerated at both doses as assessed from animal
pattern of gait and body weight. However, 6 animals
(n = 1 in control group; n = 3 in 0.4 mg/kg/day VLX60 group;
n = 2 in 0.6 mg/kg/day VLX60 group) were euthanized preterm due to a wound or penetrating cavity on the tumor.

DISCUSSION
The thiosemicarbazone family of drugs has been
investigated for several decades after the antitumor
activity of glyoxal-bis(thiosemicarbazones) was first
established for Sarcoma 180 in Swiss mice in the 1950s
[38, 39]. However, side effects, e.g. Triapine induced
methemoglobinemia, have limited their potential clinical
efficacy in solid tumors [15] and a rationally designed
change of a known thiosemicarbazone into a more potent
drug with a change in mechanism of action that utilizes
tumor specific vulnerabilities, e.g. ROS and driver
mutations, would be desirable.

KRAS and BRAF are both members of the MAPKpathway, and it is known that mutational activation of
this pathway can generate excess ROS [32, 40]. Since
cancer cells in advanced tumors frequently exhibit high
oxidative stress, an excessive ROS production through
pharmacological insults has been proposed as an effective
strategy to selectively eliminate these cancer cells [32]. As
discussed below, induction of ROS formation is proposed
to be important in the mechanism of action of VLX60.
Thus, the selective effect against BRAF mutated RKO
cells seen with VLX60 (Figure 2H and Table 1) with a
trend towards such effect in patient cells with mutated
KRAS or BRAF (Figure 4D and Table 2) are suggested to
at least partly be due excessive ROS production in cells
with altered redox regulatory mechanisms secondary to
activation of the MAPK-pathway and the fact that BRAFmutation status in RKO cells did not affect the response to
VLX50 (Figure 2G and Table 1) could be due to a lower
induction of ROS formation by VLX50 compared to
VLX60 (see below).
Interestingly, gene expression analysis showed
that genes that are upregulated by KRAS activation
were upregulated after exposure to VLX50 in contrast
to VLX60 (Online Resource, Supplementary Figure 5).
Since superoxide can activate the kinases MEK and ERK
downstream of KRAS and BRAF [41] and superoxide
formation was induced by VLX60 in contrast to VLX50
(Figure 6A), a possible explanation is that ROS induced
feed-back regulation in the MAPK-pathway is responsible
for these differences in gene expression patterns. However,
investigation of the underlying relationships between ROS
signaling and the impact of KRAS-/BRAF signaling is
beyond the scope of this study.
Of note, 72 h is a well-established incubation time
(confluence of HCT116 cells in non-treated control wells
stabilizes after ~72h) in our lab for assessment of drug
induced cytotoxic effects and, therefore, the endpoints
for mechanistic studies should be evaluated at earlier
time points when the cells are still viable. Thus, early
assessment of gene expression demonstrated that among
4 431 a priori defined gene sets, the most substantial
finding was that genes associated with oxidative stress
were considerably enriched in cells exposed to VLX60
(the gene set “Chuang oxidative stress response up”
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

exhibited the highest enrichment score), in contrast to
VLX50 (Figure 5A–5B). VLX60 induced ROS formation
was confirmed by assessment of the superoxide indicator
DHE (Figure 6A) and its importance by the reduction
in cytotoxic activity after pre-incubation with the ROS
inhibitor NAC (Figure 6D).
NAC is a precursor to glutathione with antioxidant
properties but has also been described to act as a reducing
agent that could activate copper complexes extracellularly
and induce ROS formation when co-administered [24].
However, NAC pre-loading has instead been associated
with protective effects against ROS generating copper
complexes [24]. In our study, pre-incubation with NAC
reduced the cytotoxic activity of VLX60 and therefore the
interpretation is that a theoretically expected enhanced
cytotoxic activity induced by a reduction of the copper
complex extracellularly is outweighed by the antioxidant
properties of NAC intracellularly. Importantly, in contrast
to the combination NAC + VLX60, the combination NAC
+ 100 µM CuCl2 was toxic (Figure 6E) whereas either
NAC or CuCl2 alone were non-toxic (Figure 6E). This
is in accordance with previous published results which
showed that the combination NAC + CuCl2 can induce
formation of ROS extracellularly and subsequently
induce oxidative stress in cells through transportation of
ROS into the cell [42]. Furthermore, because 100 µM
CuCl2 was non-toxic to cells (Figure 6E), anticancer
activity by the copper complex VLX60 most probably
is associated with biological activities of the copper
complex, not simply from free copper shuttled into cells
by VLX60.
A reduction of the cytotoxic activity after preincubation with NAC together with an induction of
ROS other than superoxide were seen with VLX50
(Figure 6B–6C) and might be explained by the ability
of VLX50 to scavenge Cu in the cell culture system
and induce ROS production through formation of
VLX60. Also, VLX50 could theoretically utilize
accumulated copper in cancer cells as a means of
inducing ROS at levels non-detectable by microarray
analysis and assessment of DHE but at levels able
to interfere with intracellular signaling. However,
since the gene expression results (Figure 5A–5B)
and the DHE assay (Figure 6A) demonstrate a clear
30226

involvement of ROS in the mechanism of action of
VLX60 only, the reduced cytotoxic activity observed for
both drugs after pre-incubation with NAC might also have
other, yet unknown, explanations.
Overall it is not surprising that VLX60 is
characterized by ROS production since this has
previously been described as one of the primary ways
in which Cu-complexes exert their effects [8, 22, 43,
44]. Supplementary Figure 3 suggests that VLX50
binds Cu and once formed, the complex enters the cells.
Importantly, in concordance with results presented for
other thiosemicarbazones VLX60 retained its activity in
the presence of iron, whereas addition of iron impaired the
cytotoxic activity of VLX50 [4, 5, 8] (Online Resource,
Supplementary Figure 3). The addition of Cu enhanced
the cytotoxic activity of both VLX50 and VLX60 (Online
Resource, Supplementary Figure 3). CuCl2 or FeCl3 were
nontoxic to HCT116 cells and the addition of CuCl2
and FeCl3 resulted in no change in the IC50-value of the
standard drug 5-FU (Online Resource, Supplementary
Figure 3). Altogether, these data suggests that VLX50
can react with Fe in contrast to VLX60 and that VLX60
undergoes reductive dissociation in cells, releasing Cu,
and then can pick up supplemental Cu to enhance the
overall accumulation of Cu in cells. Also, the decrease in
gene expression of genes associated with cation channel
activity after exposure to VLX60 as opposed to VLX50
(Online Resource, Supplementary Figure 5) suggests a

negative regulation secondary to an effective transport of
copper intracellularly after exposure to VLX60.
Thiosemicarbazones have recently been described
as possible ionophores for metal ions [45]. However,
VLX50 can be considered an ionophore only if VLX60
is coupled into redox chemistry that reduces Cu(II) to
Cu(I), reducing its affinity for VLX50 and subsequently
making it available to react within the cell. Also, since
thiosemicarbazones have been shown to interact not only
with copper and iron but also with other metal ions, such
as zinc [8], it is possible that VLX60 might exchange
other metal ions with copper intra- or extracellularly.
The possible interaction of thiosemicarbazones with
intracellular ions and organelles is indeed an interesting
subject for further studies. Recently, antitumor activity of
the copper complex of the thiosemicarbazone Dp44mT
was coupled to oxidative stress formation through
accumulation of the redox active copper complex in
acidic lysosomes [46] and cytotoxicity was greater
against resistant cells than their nonresistant counterparts
[3]. Also, since cancer cells have been shown to exhibit
higher copper levels than normal cells [43, 47], an
excessive copper load through pharmacological insults
has been proposed as an effective strategy to selectively
eliminate these cancer cells. The results presented here
indicate that iron depletion is of less importance for the
mechanism of action of VLX60 compared to VLX50 but
that the interaction with copper is of potential interest for

cell line HCT116 GFP following intraperitoneal administration of 0.4 or 0.6 mg/kg/day of VLX60. A 100 µl cell suspension containing 5
× 106 HCT116 GFP cells were injected subcutaneously at the right rear flank of the animals on day -10. At inclusion into the study (day
0) the majority of the tumors had reached 0.1 cm3 or slightly above and the animals were divided into one of the three study groups (n =
10 per group). VLX60 was administered daily (0.08 or 0.12 mg/mL in NaCl with 4% DMSO) from day 0 to day 28. Vehicle control (5
mL/kg of 1% CMC in PBS with 8% DMSO) was administered orally (by gavage, bid) days 0-2 (only one administration was given on
day 2). **= P = 0.0035 for VLX60 0.6 mg/kg vs control at day 28. × = P = 0.0968 for VLX60 0.4 mg/kg vs control at day 28. CMC =

the cytotoxic activity of both VLX50 and VLX60 (Online
Resource, Supplementary Figure 3). Although data
suggests that VLX50 can both pick up Fe and compete
for Cu to form VLX60 whereas VLX60 can probably
not react with Fe (Online Resource, Supplementary
Figure 3), a very high and non-physiological extracellular
concentration of copper would probably need to be
available for VLX50 to accumulate Cu intracellularly in
a similar way as VLX60.
Since proteasome inhibition has emerged as a
putative target for copper complexes we also evaluated
the effect of VLX60 on the ubiquitin-proteasome system
(UPS) [22, 29–32]. In MelJuSoUb-YFP experiments,
VLX60 exposure showed an increase in fluorescence after
24 h similar to bortezomib, an established proteasome
inhibitor (Figure 6F). However, the MelJuSoUb-YFP
assay indicates compromise of the UPS rather than specific
proteasome inhibition. Interestingly, proteasome inhibition
has recently been suggested to represent a valuable target
strategy in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer [48]. Thus,
involvement of BRAF in the mechanism of action of drugs
that compromise the UPS needs to be further elucidated.
Important general features of cytotoxic drugs such
as effects on cell cycle, cell proliferation and apoptosis
were assessed. No substantial difference between the two
compounds was observed in the cell cycle analysis at 24
h (Figure 6G). Whereas VLX60 was more potent than
VLX50, both compounds inhibited cell proliferation in
HCT116 cells up to 24 h, after which total cell number
decreased as a sign of cell death (Figure 6H). Both VLX50
and VLX60 were associated with apoptotic cell death
as judged by the gene expression analysis and increase
in fluorescence reporting caspase-3/7 (Figure 6I–6J).
However, the apoptosis process was faster for VLX60,
as indicated by the low survival and earlier increase in
fluorescence reporting caspase-3/7 after exposure to
higher concentrations of VLX50 and VLX60 (not shown).
In previous studies, thiosemicarbazones were
proposed to induce apoptosis through restoration of
mutated p53 [49, 50]. However, the almost identical
concentration - response curves regardless of p53-status
in HCT116 cells in this study argues against a role of p53
for the effect of VLX60.
Finally, the antitumor activity seen in the murine
xenograft model (Figure 7) indicates that VLX60 can exert
activity against malignant cells while sparing normal cells
in vivo. This presence of a therapeutic window (a drug
concentration range which is effective against tumors
while sparing normal tissue) is essential in the treatment
of cancer patients in the clinic and is supportive for the
development of VLX60 into an anticancer drug. VLX60
treatment at the highest concentration was well tolerated
and opens for testing of higher concentrations and different
administration schemes to optimize tumor responses.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that VLX60 is
considerably more potent than VLX50 and that the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mechanism of action is different although both drugs
are effective inhibitors of cell proliferation and induce
apoptotic cell death. Of note, VLX60 is active also in
non-proliferative models that better reflect the situation in
cancer patients and cells derived from tumors in patients
and, importantly, VLX60 exerts antitumor activity in vivo.
Thus, VLX60 shows interesting properties of potential
interest for development into a new anticancer drug,
notably against BRAF mutated colorectal cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
This investigation was conducted in accordance with
the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and
national and international guidelines and was approved by
ethical review boards as detailed below.

Cell lines
The colon cancer cell line HC116 GFP was from
Anticancer Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). The kidney cancer
cell lines ACHN, Caki-2, 786-O, the monocytic cell line
U937-GTB and the normal colon cell line CCD 841 CoN
were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC;
Manassas, VA, USA). The ovarian cancer cell line A2780
was obtained from European Collection of Cell Cultures
(ECACC; Salisbury, UK). Three pairs of colon cancer cell
lines were used to study the relationship between drug
effect and KRAS/BRAF mutation status: HCT116, HCT116
KRAS (+/−) (KO of KRAS mutant allele in heterozygous
parental cell), RKO, RKO BRAF (+/−/−) (KO of both
mutant alleles in parental cell), DLD, DLD KRAS (+/−)
(KO of KRAS mutant allele in heterozygous parental cell)
were from Horizon Discovery Ltd., Cambridge, UK. All
purchased cell lines were authenticated by short-term
repeat analysis performed by the cell banks.
The colon cancer cell line HCT116 p53−/− was
kindly provided by Prof. Bert Vogelstein (Johns Hopkins
University, Baltimore, MD, USA). The melanoma cell
line MelJuSoUb-YFP was kindly provided by Prof. Nico
Dantuma (Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden).
The cell lines were cultured at 37°C in a humidified
incubator containing 5% CO2 in McCoy´s 5A medium
(Caki-2, HCT116, HC116 GFP, HCT116 p53−/−, HCT116
KRAS (+/−), RKO, RKO BRAF (+/−/−), DLD, DLDKRAS(+/−)), RPMI1640 medium (A2780, U937-GTB,
ACHN, 786-O), MEME medium (MelJuSoUb-YFP) or

Patient tumor cells

For subsequent experiments in the colon cancer
cell lines with different KRAS, BRAF or p53 status (see
above), cell suspension (2 500 cells/well) was added to
drug-prepared 384-well plates as described below for
patient samples or cells (2 500/well in 50 µl medium) were
seeded into 384-well plates and allowed to pre-incubate
overnight after which drug was added using the liquid
handling system ECHO® 550 (Labcyte Inc., Sunnyvale,
CA, USA). This allows for fast transfer of volumes ≥2.5
nL from source plates into destination wells. In ECHO®
experiments, source plates were prepared with appropriate
concentrations of drugs in DMSO and stored in the
oxygen and moisture free MiniPod™ system (Roylan
Developments Ltd, Surrey, UK) until further use. The
cells were always incubated with drug for 72 h before
assessment of cell viability (see below).
For tumor cells from patient samples, 45 µl cell
suspension (5 000 cells/well for solid tumors, 40 000
cells/well for AML) were seeded into each well in the
drug-prepared 384-well plates (5 µl/well of drug solution
at 10x final concentration). All culture plates were
incubated for 72 h at 37°C in 5% CO2 before assessment
of cell viability.
Following the 72 h incubation, cell viability was
assessed using the fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity
assay (FMCA). The FMCA is based on the conversion
of fluorescein diacetate (FDA, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no.
F7378) to fluorescein by esterases in cells with intact
plasma membranes [51–53]. Briefly, cells were washed
in PBS and FDA buffer [52] and FDA solution (0.5 mg
ml-1 in DMSO) added (50 µl FDA buffer/well, 1 µl FDA
solution/well). After 50–70 min incubation at 37°C,
plates were read in the scanning fluorometer FLUOstar
Optima (BMG Labtech GmbH, Offenburg, Germany).
The assay was executed in a semi-automated robot system
as previously described [52]. Cell viability as reported
from the FMCA is expressed as survival index (SI) and
is defined as the fluorescence in experimental wells (with
blank wells subtracted) in per cent of that in control wells,
with blank wells subtracted.

Tumor samples were obtained from patients
diagnosed with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML),
ovarian-, colorectal- or kidney cancer by bone marrow/
blood sampling, surgery or diagnostic biopsy. The
patient sampling was approved by the regional ethical
committee, Uppsala University (file Dnr 2007/237). Tumor
cells from bone marrow/blood (AML) were collected by
centrifugation and isolated by Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare,
Waukesha, WI, USA) and/or Percoll (GE Healthcare)
density gradient centrifugation [51]. Samples from solid
tumors were finely minced and digested with collagenase
and tumor cells were isolated by Percoll (GE Healthcare)
density gradient centrifugation [51]. KRAS- and BRAF
mutation status of colorectal cancer patient samples was
retrieved from pathology reports in the patient files.

Drugs
VLX50 is a thiosemicarbazone experimental drug
with iron depletion as main mechanism of action [5].
VLX60 is a copper chelate of VLX50. VLX50 was from
Maybridge (Cambridge, UK) and VLX60 was synthesized
by author GW. Since VLX60 has VLX50 as precursor
a synthesis procedure to give access to larger amounts
of VLX50 was developed. For synthesis and chemical
characterization of compounds, see supplementary section 1
and Supplementary Figure 1 (Online Resource). Rotenone,
CuCl2 and FeCl3 were from Sigma-Aldrich and bortezomib
from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA). The
compounds were dissolved in dimethyl-sulfoxide (DMSO)
and diluted in either phosphate buffered saline (PBS) or
distilled water, depending on solubility. N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) was dissolved in distilled water. Final concentration
of DMSO in experimental wells was always < 1%. Drug
concentrations of VLX50 and VLX60 for the experimental
comparisons were those inducing similar degrees of toxicity
in HCT116 cells (10 µM VLX50 vs 2 µM VLX60).

Measurement of cytotoxicity in monolayer
cultured cell lines and patient tumor cells

Assessment of drug effects in tumor cell
spheroids

The initial cell line experiments were done using
96-well microplates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) prepared
as previously described [52] with 20 µl drug solution at
10× the desired final concentration, using a multipipette or
the pipetting robot BioMek 2000 (Beckman Coulter, Brea,
CA, USA). The plates were kept at −70°C and thawed
immediately prior to further use. On the first day of the
experiment, 180 μl cell suspension with 5 000–20 000 cells
(depending on the individual cell line doubling time) were
seeded into each well in the drug-prepared 96-well plates,
manually or by using the pipetting robot Precision 2000
(Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, VT, USA), reaching a
final volume in each well of 200 μl.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Spheroids were prepared as described [54]. Briefly,
200 µl cell suspension with 5 000 HCT116 GFP cells were
seeded into each well of a 96-well NanoCulture® plate
(SCIVAX USA, Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). The plates
were incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. Drug exposure started
when the spheroids had formed for 3 or 6 days. At start of
drug exposure, 100μl of medium/well was removed with a
Multiwasher (DYNEX Technologies, Inc., Chantilly, VA,
USA), followed by addition of 80 μl fresh medium and
20 μl drug solution at 10× the final concentration.
The spheroids were incubated with drugs for
72 h and then dissociated by addition of 100 µl/well of

Assessment of oxidative stress

Accumax (PAA, Pasching, Austria) and incubation at
37for 30 min followed by mixing with a multipipette
[54]. After one wash in PBS, cell viability was assessed
as described above. The plates were also monitored
in the IncuCyte fluorescence (FLR) system (Essen
BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) [54], which allows for
visual and functional quality control of spheroid growth
through automated data acquisition of phase contrast and
fluorescent images within the cell culture incubator prior
to survival assessment with the FMCA.

I. HCT116 cells (5 000 – 20 000/well) were
seeded into 96-well plates and allowed to pre-incubate
overnight. Drugs were added the next day and the
commercially available Cellomics® Oxidative Stress I
Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Gothenburg, Sweden) was
used to study oxidative stress. The assay was analyzed in
the fluorescence microscope Arrayscan II high content
screening system (Cellomics Inc., Pittsburgh, PA, USA).
Fluorescence provides a readout of the superoxide indicator
dihydroethidium (DHE) oxidation of ROS generation. II.
Induction of other ROS than superoxide was assessed
with Oxidative Stress Detection Reagent (Green) and
the positive control pyocyanin from the Cellular ROS/
Superoxide Detection Assay Kit (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). HCT116 cells (2500/well) were seeded into 384-well
plates and allowed to pre-incubate overnight. NAC (5 mM)
was added 30 min before drug. Drugs and Oxidative Stress
Detection Reagent (Green) were added using the liquid
handling system ECHO® 550. The plates were incubated for
2 h, centrifuged and washed twice in PBS and then analyzed
in the IncuCyte ZOOM Live-Cell Analysis System (Essen
BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). Fluorescence provides
a readout of the probe which has a low sensitivity for
superoxide and reacts directly with a wide range of reactive
species, e.g. hydrogen peroxide, peroxynitrite, hydroxyl
radicals, nitric oxide and peroxy radical, yielding a green
fluorescent product. III. In the ROS inhibitor experiments
measurement of cytotoxicity was performed in 384-well
plates (2 500 cells/well) as described above (with FMCA)
with 5 mM NAC added 30 min before drug.

VLX 50 and VLX60 mechanistic exploration
using gene expression analysis
The gene expression analysis of VLX50 and
VLX60 was performed according to the original protocol,
as previously described [55]. Briefly, HCT116 cells (0.3
x 106 cells/well) were seeded into each well in 6-well
plates and allowed to attach for 24 h. VLX50, VLX60
or vehicle control (DMSO) were then added at a final
concentration of 10 µM (VLX50) or 2 µM (VLX60).
Cells were incubated with drug or vehicle control for 6
h and then washed with PBS. RNA was isolated using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). RNA
concentration and quality were measured using an ND
1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE, USA) and Bioanalyzer system (Agilent
Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA, USA), respectively.
Starting from 2 µg of total RNA from each sample,
gene expression analysis was performed using Human
Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays according to the GeneChip
Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Rev. nr 5,
Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA). Raw data was
MAS5 normalized.
Gene expression ratios for drug vs. vehicle
exposed cells were calculated to generate a list of
regulated genes, based on the RMA normalized data,
and this list was filtrated using flags from the MAS5
normalization. Only probes with present call in both
drug treated and vehicle control lists were used in the
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), as described
previously [56]. Average fold change was used as rank
metric for drug vs. vehicle exposed cells to establish
the rank lists. The rank lists were compared with a
priori defined and curated gene sets with the purpose to
find out whether these a priori defined gene sets were
significantly enriched toward the upper or lower end
of the ranked lists. The p-value refers to the nominal
p-value after 1000 permutations. Individual genes
included in the a priori defined gene sets are presented
as supplementary material in the form of excel-files
named “Supplementary Table 1 (VLX50 10 µM)” and
“Supplementary Table 2 (VLX60 2 µM)”. Raw and
normalized expression data have been deposited at Gene
Expression Omnibus (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/) with accession number GSE86309.

Cell cycle analysis
HCT116 cells (0.3 × 106 cells/well) were seeded
into each well in 6-well plates and allowed to attach for
24 h. VLX50, VLX60 or vehicle control (DMSO) were
then added at a final concentration of 10 µM (VLX50)
or 2 µM (VLX60). Cells were incubated with drug or
vehicle control for 0–72h and the commercially available
kit Two-step cell cycle analysis (Application note No.
0254. Rev. 1.1; ChemoMetec, Allerod, Denmark) was
used to study the cell cycle. The assay was analyzed in the
NucleoCounter® NC-250™ (ChemoMetec).

Assessment of the effects on the ubiquitinproteasome system and apoptosis
The IncuCyte FLR system (Essen BioScience) was
used to study effects on the ubiquitin-proteasome system
(UPS) and apoptosis. MelJuSoUb-YFP (yellow fluorescent
protein) is a melanoma cell line transfected with a plasmid
encoding the reporter substrate UbG76V-YFP. Proteasome
inhibition, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress or other
stress factors compromise the UPS and cause accumulation
30230

Data analysis and presentation

of the UPS substrate UbG76V-YFP. This accumulation results
in an increase in cellular fluorescence [57]. MelJuSoUbYFP cells were seeded at a concentration of 6 000 cells/90
µl MEME-medium/well into 96-well plates and allowed
to pre-incubate overnight after which 10 µl drug solution
at 10x the final concentration were added to each well.
The plates were monitored in the IncuCyte for 48 h and
the IncuCyte FLR system software was used to calculate
object count per mm2 based on fluorescence.
For assessment of apoptosis, HCT116 cells were
seeded at a concentration of 10 000 cells/80 µl McCoy´s
medium/well into 96-well plates and allowed to preincubate overnight followed by addition of 10 µl/well of
Essen CellPlayerTM Kinetic Caspase-3/7 Apoptosis reagent
drug (Essen) and then immediately 10 µl/well of drug
at 10× the final concentration, reaching a final volume
of 100µl/well. The final concentration of the kinetic
apoptosis reagent was 2.5 µM. The plates were monitored
in the IncuCyte for 48 h and the IncuCyte FLR system
software was used to calculate object count per mm2 based
on fluorescence. The assay provides a kinetic readout of
apoptotic signaling based on activation of Caspase-3/7.

For in vitro studies IC50 values, i.e. the concentration
resulting in a SI-value of 50%, were obtained using nonlinear regression in GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software
Inc., CA, USA). Results are presented as means ± SEM
or means ± 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the number
of experiments indicated. Comparisons between mutatedand parental cell lines were done with unpaired Student´s
t-test. GraphPad Prism 5 was used for result calculations,
statistical inference and graphical presentation.
For in vivo studies the mean with SEM was
calculated for tumour volumes recorded during the
experiment. At start, all groups comprised 10 animals
(N  =  10), but along the study a few animals were
euthanized due to reduced health status. Tumour data
from animals terminated pre-term was carried forward in
the statistical analysis (one animal in the 0.4 mg/kg/day
group was euthanized at day 3 due to abnormal gait and
was excluded from the analysis). Differences in tumour
volume between the groups were calculated using repeated
measures (from day 0 to 28) two-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey´s multiple comparisons test using GraphPad Prism
7. Comparisons were made between Group 1 (Vehicle) vs
Group 2 (Vehicle + VLX60 0.4 mg/kg/day) and Group 1
(Vehicle) vs Group 3 (VLX60 0.6 mg/kg/day). A p-value
of < 0.05 was used to indicate statistical significance.

Assessment of drug effects in tumor xenografts
Mice experiments received ethics approval by
regional animal experimental ethics committee in Stockholm
(North), approval number N37/15 and N188/15. The age
of the mice were 7 weeks at arrival and acclimatisation
was a minimum of five days before commencement of
the experiment. Five animals per cage were maintained
in individually ventilated cages (type IVC2). Temperature
was kept at 21–22°C, humidity was 50–60% and a 12 h
light, 12 h dark cycle was applied. Autoclaved tap water
was available ad libitum in water bottles and the animals
received R70, irradiated, diet (Lantmännen, Sweden).
Female NMRI nu/nu mice (Crl:NMRI-Foxn1nu) from
Charles River, Germany, were injected subcutaneously at the
right flank with 5 × 106 HCT116 GFP cells 10 days before
randomization into treatment groups. When the majority of
the tumors had reached 0.1 cm3 (day 0) the animals were
randomly assigned into treatment groups (n = 10 animals
per group) and administered a daily intraperitoneal dose
(0.4 mg/kg or 0.6 mg/kg; 0.08 or 0.12 mg/mL respectively
in NaCl with 4% DMSO) of VLX60 for 28 days or control
vehicle (administered by oral gavage with 5 mL/kg of 1%
carboxymethylcellulose sodium salt (CMC) in PBS with 8%
DMSO twice daily from day 0–2; only one administration
day 2). The length and width of each tumor was measured
with the use of a caliper twice weekly and tumor volume
was calculated by the formula length (cm) × width (cm)
× width (cm) × 0.44. Body weight was recorded at the start
and at the end of the study and the animals were checked
daily for change in activity and appearance as signs of a
change in general health status.
