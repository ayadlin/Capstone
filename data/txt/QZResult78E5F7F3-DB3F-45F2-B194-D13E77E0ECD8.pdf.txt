ABSTRACT
There is growing evidence for the role of cancer stem-cells in drug resistance,
but with few in situ studies on human tumor samples to decipher the mechanisms by
which they resist anticancer agents.
Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most severe sub-type of breast
cancer, occurring in younger women and associated with poor prognosis even when
treated at a localized stage.
We investigated here the relationship between complete pathological response
after chemotherapy and breast cancer stem-cell characteristics in pre-treatment
biopsies of 78 women with triple negative breast carcinoma (TNBC).
We found that chemoresistance was associated with large numbers of breast
cancer stem-cells, and that these cancer stem-cells were neither proliferative nor
apoptotic, but in an autophagic state related to hypoxia. Using relevant pharmacological
models of patient-derived TNBC xenografts, we further investigated the role of
autophagy in chemoresistance of breast cancer stem-cells. We demonstrated that
hypoxia increased drug resistance of autophagic TNBC stem-cells, and showed
that molecular or chemical inhibition of autophagic pathway was able to reverse
chemoresistance.
Our results support breast cancer stem-cell evaluation in pre-treatment biopsies
of TNBC patients, and the need for further research on autophagy inhibition to reverse
resistance to chemotherapy.

resistance to its own therapeutic effect in cancer stem
cells via induced hypoxia [5]. In women with localized
breast cancer, resistance to chemotherapy delivered before
surgery is associated with larger numbers of cancer stemcells after treatment [6].
The most severe breast cancer in younger women,
associated with poor prognosis even when treated at a
localized stage [7], is triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
defined by lack of expression of HER2, estrogen and
progesterone receptors. The standard care for localized
TNBC, when inflammatory or over 3 cm in diameter, is
neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgical removal of the
primary tumor [8]. The absence of residual tumor at the
time of surgery defines complete pathological response
(pCR) [9], which is a relevant prognostic endpoint in
clinical trials evaluating neoadjuvant chemotherapy for
breast cancer [10]. The prognosis for women with pCR
is excellent [9], but when pCR is not achieved, TNBC
patients have a high relapse rate and poor survival [7].
Factors predicting pCR, and thus response to neoadjuvant
chemotherapy, are still lacking.
The mechanisms by which cancer stem-cells
resist anticancer agents are also not deciphered. Macroautophagy, here referred to as autophagy, is a lysosomal
pathway whereby a cell digests its own cytoplasmic
components [11]. Initially described as a cell death
mechanism [12], autophagy is also a cell survival pathway
to escape programmed cell death and maintain cellular
homeostasis, and that can be upregulated in quiescent
cells [13]. It can thus be a survival process for cancer
cells in response to intrinsic or extrinsic stress conditions,
including hypoxic stress [14–16]. BNIP3L, an autophagy
related protein, is linked to hypoxia: HIF1α induces its
expression, leading to the activation of BECLIN1 and the
autophagy pathway [16, 17]. Recent in vitro studies have
also demonstrated the critical role of autophagy in the
maintenance of breast cancer stem-cells [18, 19].
We investigated here the relationship between
complete pathological response after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy and breast cancer stem-cell characteristics
in pre-treatment biopsies of 78 women with TNBC.
Using patient-derived xenografts obtained from women
with metastatic TNBC, we further investigated the role
of autophagy in the chemoresistance of breast cancer
stem-cells.

13.21 mm (± 1.56 mm), mean width 1.14 mm (± 0.12 mm),
and mean surface area 15.05 mm² (± 1.88 mm²).
Breast surgery was performed after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for all patients. The same two pathologists
(PB, AR) analyzed all surgical pieces. pCR, defined
as absence of residual disease at the time of surgery in
both breast and axillary lymph nodes, was found for
20 surgical pieces (25.6%). Over a median clinical followup of 33.2 months (range 4–75.5), the relapse rate was
14.8% for pCR patients, differing significantly (p < 0.01)
from the 59.2% relapse rate for non-pCR patients
(Supplementary Figure 1).

Cancer stem-cell characterization and counts in
patient tumor samples (Figure 1, Table 1)
We identified and counted breast cancer stemcells in pre-treatment biopsies using CD133, CD146 and
ALDH1 immunostaining.
Counted on single immunoperoxydase staining
(Figure 1A), CD133 expressing cells, ALDH1 expressing
cells as well as CD146 expressing cells were significantly
more numerous in non-pCR versus pCR patients
(10.4% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.01; 8.6% vs. 2.6%, p < 0.01, and
17.8% vs. 6.3%, p < 0.01 respectively).
Since CD133, ALDH1, and CD146 might not
precisely identify the same stem-cells, we performed
double immunofluorescence stainings and counted the cells
co-expressing CD133 and ALDH1 (Figure 1B), and the
cells co-expressing CD133 and CD146 (Figure 1C). In the
78 biopsies, the number of CD133/ALDH1 coexpressing
cells and the number of CD133/CD146 coexpressing
cells were again significantly larger in non-pCR
patients than in pCR patients (6.3% ± 1.2 vs. 1.2% ± 0.3
for CD133/ALDH1 coexpressing cells, and 9.2% ± 3.1
vs. 3.1% ± 1.1 for CD133/CD146 coexpressing cells)
(p < 0.01 in both cases).

Breast cancer stem-cells are in a quiescent
autophagic state related to hypoxia in patient
tumor samples
As biopsies had been performed at some distance
from necrotic areas detectable on ultrasonography,
necrosis, when present, was restricted to small areas of
mean 0.37 mm² (± 0.14 mm²) (Figure 1D). Necrosis being
an indirect marker of hypoxia [5], we assessed presence or
absence of necrosis on the biopsies. Presence of necrosis
was significantly associated with non-pCR (p < 0.01), and
with the number of CD133/ALDH1 or CD133/CD146 coexpressing cells (p < 0.01).
We then assessed proliferation and apoptosis in
patient tumor samples (Figure 1E and 1F, Supplementary
Table 1). When all tumor cells were counted, the Ki67
proliferation rate and apoptotic cell numbers were not
significantly different in pCR and non-pCR patients

(41% versus 32.3%, p = 0.14; and 24% versus 20.5%,
p = 0.21 respectively). When only CD133 expressing
cells were counted in non-pCR patients, proliferation and
apoptosis rates were both significantly lower than in all
tumor cells (p < 0.05).
To determine if this quiescent state of breast cancer
stem cells was linked to activation of autophagy pathway,
we assessed the expression of three autophagy related
proteins: BNIP3L, BECLIN1, and LC3B. Particularly, for
LC3B marker which enables the detection of autophagic
vesicles [20, 21], we observed typical cytoplasmic
punctuated staining (Figure 2B), as previously reported
[22]. When all tumor cells were counted, numbers of
BECLIN1 expressing cells, BNIP3L expressing cells, and
LC3B expressing cells were significantly smaller in pCR
patients than in non-pCR patients (1.1% vs. 5.8%, 8.5%
vs. 18%, and 3.6% vs. 12% respectively, p < 0.05).
In CD133-expressing cells, the percentage of cells
with autophagic activity was significantly higher than in all
tumor cells, of 68%, 79% and 75% for BECLIN1, BNIP3L,
and for LC3B respectively (p < 0.01) (Figure 2A, 2B
and Supplementary Table 1). We checked a possible link
between hypoxia and autophagy marker expression in these
breast cancer stem-cells. On pre-treatment biopsies, tumor
cells expressing carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX), a hypoxicwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

related protein [23], were distributed in peri-necrotic
areas (Figure 2B). In addition, double immunostaining
showed that LC3B-expressing cells co-expressed CAIX
(Figure 2C), and were thus preferentially distributed in
the peri-necrotic areas. To control these results, we used
laser-microdissection of CD133-expressing and CD133negative tumor cells in pre-treatment biopsies of non-pCR
patients (Figure 2D and 2E). We found that CD133expressing stem-cells had significantly higher mRNA
expression levels of BECN1, BNIP3L, MAPLC3B, CAIX
and HIF1A than CD133-negative tumor cells (p < 0.05)
(Figure 2F).

Multivariate analysis
Cancer stem-cell numbers, presence of necrosis,
and numbers of Ki67-, TUNEL-, BECLIN1- BNIP3L-,
or LC3B-expressing cells were studied in multivariate
analysis for their correlation with pCR. Multivariate
forward regression showed that  CD133, BECLIN1,
BNIP3L and LC3B expression was negatively associated
with pCR (p < 0.05) and the principal component analysis
also assessed this negative correlation (Figure 2G).

for BECN1 and 65% (from 683 to 239, p < 0.05) for
BNIP3L (Figure 5A).
Electron microscopic study focused on cytoplasmic
areas of tumor cells (see Methods and Supplementary
Figure 5). It showed a striking difference between tumor
cells transfected with empty plasmid, which had large
numbers of cytoplasmic autophagosomes, and sg1BECN1
or sg1BNIP3L transfected tumor cells (Figure 5B).
Counts performed on cytoplasmic areas of 25
cells in each experimental condition showed that the
mean number of autophagosomes per 1000 µm² of
cytoplasmic area was 35.8 in cells transfected with empty
plasmid versus 6.5 and 9.8 in sg1BECN1 and sg1BNIP3L
transfected cells respectively (p < 0.05 in both cases).

patient and the inhibition coefficient in the corresponding
xenograft with the same chemotherapy (R = 0.81,
p < 0.01) (Figure 3C).
Overall, our xenograft models from human metastatic
TNBC were relevant pre-clinical pharmacological models
to study chemoresistance.

Experimental hypoxia induced autophagy and
resistance to drugs in cancer stem-cells derived
from the sensitive TNBC xenograft model
Further experiments were performed using XBC1
chemosensitive and XBC4 chemoresistant patient-derived
xenograft models.
When we assessed CD133, ALDH1, and CD146
expression in the two models, the numbers of cells
expressing CD133 or CD146 were significantly larger in
XBC4 than in XBC1. As in patients, CD133-expressing
cells did not co-express Ki67 and were negative on
TUNEL assay (Supplementary Figure 2).
We grew spheres larger than 100 µm diameter
[24] from CD133-positive cells sorted from XBC1 and
XBC4 models (Figure 4A). Under normoxic conditions,
CD133-expressing cells and CD146-expressing cells were
more numerous in XBC4 spheres than in XBC1 spheres
(p < 0.05) (Figure 4B).
When XBC1 spheres were cultured under hypoxic
conditions, the number CD146-expressing cells increased
from 3 to 31% (p < 0.01), a high percentage comparable
to the 20% of CD146-expressing cells in XBC4 spheres
(Figure 4B).
For autophagy markers, in normoxia, mRNA
BECN1 and BNIP3L levels were overexpressed in
XBC4 spheres compared to XBC1 spheres (p < 0.05).
Experimental hypoxia increased BECN1 and BNIP3L
mRNA levels in both XBC1 and XBC4 spheres (p < 0.05)
(Supplementary Figure 3).
Under normoxic conditions, resistance to cisplatin,
epirubicin and paclitaxel was higher for XBC4 spheres
than for XBC1 spheres. Experimental hypoxia increased
resistance to the three drugs in XBC1 spheres, but not in
XBC4 spheres (Supplementary Table 4, Figure 4C for
cisplatin).

In vivo autophagy inhibition reversed
chemoresistance in resistant TNBC xenograft
model
We assessed the tumorigenicity of XBC4 spheres cotransfected with GFP and sg1BECN1 or sg1BNIP3L. Using
laser micro-dissection in liquid medium, GFP-positive cells
were selected 48 h after transfection and antibiotic selection
(Figure 6A). We checked that these cells were viable and
that they also had a more than 65% decrease in BECN1 or
BNIP3L copy numbers, but when 200 cells were injected
sub-cutaneously in 8 mice, there was no engraftment
(Figure 6B). Conversely, when we selected GFP-negative
cells, they had no significant decrease in BECN1 or
BNIP3L copy numbers, and 200 cells were tumorigenic in
6/8 and 7/8 grafted mice respectively (Figure 6B).
When we used an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine
[25], to treat the three cisplatin-resistant xenografts,
XBC2, XBC3 and XBC4 (Figure 6C and Supplementary
Figure 6), there was no change in tumor growth at Day 28,
but the numbers of CD133 or CD146-expressing tumor
cells significantly decreased (p < 0.05) (illustrated for
XBC4 in Figure 6C).
When chloroquine was added to cisplatin, there was
significant tumor growth inhibition compared to treatment
with chloroquine alone in the three cisplatin-resistant
xenografts: the percentage of tumor volume at Day28
was 267% versus 365% for chloroquine alone (p < 0.01)
for XBC2; 208% versus 432% for chloroquine alone
(p < 0.01) for XBC3; 202% versus 345% for chloroquine
alone (p < 0.01) for XBC4 (Supplementary Figure 6).
The combination of cisplatin and chloroquine in
the three cisplatin-resistant xenografts also induced a
significant decrease in the numbers of CD133 or CD146expressing cells when Day28 was compared to Day 0
(p < 0.01) (illustrated for XBC4 in Figure 6C).

In vitro autophagy inhibition reversed
chemoresistance in cancer stem-cells derived
from the resistant TNBC xenograft model
To understand the role of autophagy in
chemoresistance of breast cancer stem cells, we invalidated
BECN1 or BNIP3L expression in XBC4 spheres. To knock
out these two genes, we used the innovative CRISPRCAS9 technology, particularly suited to spheres with brief
viability (Supplementary Figure 4). 48 h after transfection
and antibiotic selection, we obtained significant decreases
in mRNA copy numbers: 71% (from 1798 to 525, p < 0.05)

We thus demonstrated that the molecular or chemical
inhibition of the autophagic pathway was able to reverse
chemoresistance in triple negative breast carcinoma.

In pre-treatment biopsies of 78 patients with TNBC,
we first showed that chemoresistance was associated
with large numbers of cancer stem-cells. These cancer
stem-cells were hypoxic, and this was not due to tissue
processing since all pre-treatment biopsies were performed
under ultrasonography to avoid large necrotic areas.
Biopsies were calibrated and processed identically,
enabling us to analyze comparable areas of tumor tissue.

assessed on breast surgery pieces. The pCR rate we found

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated the role of hypoxia
and autophagy in the resistance to chemotherapy of cancer
stem-cells in TNBC.

TNBCs treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. [10]
For in situ characterization of breast cancer stem cells,
we did not use the combination of markers CD44+CD24-/low,
[18, 27] since this combination of positive and negative

markers, currently used in cytometry, is more difficult to
translate into in situ tissue analyses and cell counts. [28]
CD133, ALDH1 and CD146 are three positive markers
used for studying triple negative breast cancer stem-cells.
[29–32] In addition, CD133 and ALDH1 cancer stem cells

decrease in CD133 or CD146-expressing cell numbers when Day28 is compared to Day 0. *p < 0.05.

are preferentially distributed in hypoxic areas [5, 33] while
CD44+CD24-/low breast cancer stem cells are mainly found on
the tumor invasive edge. [28] In the pre-treatment biopsies
studied here, whether counted on single staining or on
combined double staining, breast cancer stem-cell numbers
were significantly larger in non-pCR patients than in pCR
patients. This could result from changes in proliferation
and/or apoptosis rates. But the Ki67 proliferation rate was
significantly lower for stem-cells than for tumor cells as
a whole, a result coherent with in vitro studies showing
that ALDH1-positive breast cancer stem-cells are not in a
proliferative state. [34] In the same pre-treatment biopsies,
the apoptosis rate was also significantly lower for stemcells than for tumor cells as a whole. This fact, not hitherto
reported, could contribute to the maintenance of a large
number of cancer stem-cells in non-pCR patients.

cancer stem-cells [2] and in the maintenance of breast
cancer stem-cells [18, 19, 27, 35] has recently been
demonstrated. When we looked for autophagy markers in
our pre-treatment biopsies of non-pCR TNBCs, we found
that CD133-expressing cancer stem cells co-expressed
BECLIN1, LC3B, and BNIP3L. When we used another
independent method based on laser-microdissection of
CD133-expressing cells combined with quantitative PCR,
we also found an expression of the three autophagy markers
in cancer stem-cells. A multivariate analysis based on cell
counts found an inverse correlation between the number
of cells expressing markers of stemness or autophagy and
pCR, a bio-clinical correlation hitherto not demonstrated.
On the basis of our experience with patient-derived
renal cancer xenograft for the study of cancer stem-cells
and resistance to drugs, [5] we implemented patientderived xenografts of TNBC. Patient-derived xenografts
are more relevant pharmacological tools than xenografts
from human cancer cell lines, which have poor reliability
in predicting response to chemotherapy in patients. [36–38]
Using four patient-derived xenograft models with genomic
stability over passages, we found that three of them
had resistance to cisplatin. Two of the four models had
opposed sensitivity to three drugs used to treat women
with metastatic TNBC. These two models reproduced
the clinical response to drugs, with a large number of
quiescent cancer stem-cells in the chemoresistant model.
We focused our pre-clinical studies on breast cancer stemcells derived from these two opposite models to study the
mechanisms of drug resistance in TNBC stem-cells.
We first demonstrated that hypoxia increased drug
resistance of autophagic TNBC stem-cells. Using spheres
derived from the chemosensitive model, we showed that
experimental hypoxia increased the number of autophagic
cancer stem-cells, a result in accordance with in vitro
studies using human cancer cell lines. [19, 39, 40]
In the same chemosensitive model, experimental
hypoxia also increased resistance to cisplatin, epirubicin,
and paclitaxel. So far, a link between hypoxia and drug
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

resistance of cancer stem-cells has only been demonstrated
for anti-angiogenic drugs. Sunitinib generates tumor
hypoxia and increases the numbers of cancer stemcells in xenografts obtained from human TNBC cell
lines. [33] In human renal carcinomas, we demonstrated
that sunitinib was able to generate resistance to its own
therapeutic effect via induced hypoxia in cancer stem
cells. [5] Here, on TNBC cancer stem-cells, we studied
three cytotoxic drugs with main effects not on angiogenic
vessels but on tumor cells. Cisplatin forms platinum
adducts with DNA, which impedes DNA replication and
transcription, thus leading to apoptotic cell death. [41]
Paclitaxel is a taxoid that binds to tubulin polymers and
inhibits microtubule depolymerisation, thus disrupting
tumor cell microtubule dynamics and leading to apoptotic
cell death. [42] Epirubicin is an anthracycline that inhibits
the activity of topoisomerase II, thus impairing tumor cell
DNA replication. However, a recent study demonstrated
that paclitaxel is able to induce the HIF pathway in TNBC
cell lines. [43] Thus, although it does not target angiogenic
vessels, paclitaxel is able to induce hypoxia in tumoral
tissue. The originality of our results is that they link
hypoxia, autophagy and drug resistance in TNBC stemcells. We used experimental hypoxia on TNBC stem-cells
to reproduce the results found in biopsies of TNBC patients
resistant to chemotherapy who had a large number of stemcells expressing autophagic markers around necrotic areas.
This link between hypoxia, autophagy and drug
resistance in TNBC stem-cells raises a new issue for the
translational relevance for women with metastatic TNBC.
Is it possible to modulate autophagy in breast cancer stemcells to reverse resistance to chemotherapy? In recent years,
autophagy has been proposed as a potential target for cancer
therapy. [25] There are pre-clinical [44, 45] and clinical
[46, 47] data on the potential benefit of autophagy inhibition
as an anticancer therapy. Particularly, in a pediatric brain
tumor with BRAF mutation, hydroxycholoroquine was
able to reverse acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor.
[48] In our study, we demonstrated both in vitro and
in vivo that autophagy inhibition was able to reverse
resistance to drugs. In vitro, using spheres derived from
the chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft model, the
molecular invalidation of autophagy markers enabled
us to reverse chemoresistance to cisplatin, epirubicin
and paclitaxel. In vivo, we used chloroquine, a chemical
inhibitor of autophagy, and showed that chloroquine alone
induced a decrease in numbers of cancer stem cells, but
with limited cytotoxic effect and thus no change in tumor
growth inhibition, two effects previously described in
in vitro models [49, 50]. However chloroquine added to
cisplatin was able to reverse resistance to cisplatin in the
three cisplatin-resistant patient-derived xenograft TNBC
models, probably as a result of autophagy inhibition in the
breast cancer stem cells but also in the whole tumor.
This study also affects existing knowledge in the
field of response to therapy in TNBC, since it identifies a

marker predictive of response to chemotherapy in biopsies
performed before any treatment, thus at the optimal
moment to design a therapeutic strategy.
The clinical relevance of our results is a major strength
of this work, and this has been obtained through rigorous
clinical, radiological and pathological methodologies.
However, the generalisation of the conclusions requires a
validation cohort.

CD133, ALDH1 and CD146 expression was assessed
and cells counted on TNBC pre-treatment biopsies; we also
counted ALDH1/CD133 and CD146/CD133-coexpressing
cells (Supplementary Methods).

Proliferation, apoptosis, autophagy and cancer
stem-cells in human tumor samples

MATERIALS AND METHODS

On pre-treatment biopsies, i) tumor cell and
cancer stem-cell proliferation rates were assessed; ii)
in situ apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL assay,
and CD133-expressing/TUNEL-expressing cells were
counted; iii) the expression of three cellular markers of
autophagy, BECLIN1, BNIP3L, and LC3B was assessed
(Supplementary Methods).

Patients and tumor samples
In the Centre-Maladies-du-Sein, Hôpital-St-Louis,
Paris, a registry of patients treated with neoadjuvant
chemotherapy for localized breast carcinoma prospectively
enrolled 361 patients between 2005 and 2011. For
diagnostic purposes, all patients underwent core needle
biopsies before chemotherapy; 107 had ductal triple
negative adenocarcinoma (TNBC).
Ultrasonography-guided pre-treatment biopsies were
similarly performed, using a 16-gauge needle, at least 1 cm
from necrotic areas detected on ultrasonography. Tissue
samples were similarly processed, one formaldehyde-fixed
and paraffin-embedded, and one snap-frozen.
In compliance with French Bioethics law (2004–800,
06/08/2004), all patients had been informed of the research
use of the part of their samples remaining after diagnosis
had been established, and did not oppose it. Informed
consent was obtained for each patient. Tumor tissue was
available for this study for 78 of the 107 TNBC patients.
Surgical pieces obtained after neoadjuvant
chemotherapy were independently analyzed by two
pathologists (AR, PB) unaware of response to treatment.
pCR was defined, according to [10], by absence of residual
tumor at time of surgery both in breast and axillary lymph
node samples.
Radiotherapy was delivered after surgery to patients
who had breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy for
initial advanced stages. The patients’ follow-up was clinical,
biological and radiological according to institutional
guidelines, and the relapse rate was calculated considering
local and metastatic relapse, or cancer-related death.

Autophagy and hypoxia in cancer stem-cells of
human tumor samples
To characterize hypoxic areas on non-pCR pretreatment biopsies, we assessed the in situ expression of a
hypoxic-related protein, CAIX.
To check any possible co-expression of hypoxic and
autophagy markers in cancer cells, we performed double
immunofluorescent stainings using anti-human LC3B
and CAIX (NB100-417, Novus Biologicals, France)
antibodies, labelled with Apex-alexa-Fluor 488 nm and
647 nm (A10475, Life-Technology) respectively.
To control these immunostaining results, we used
a completely different method combining morphological
analyses and molecular markers. On frozen pretreatment biopsies, CD133-expressing cells were lasermicrodissected and their BNIP3L, BECN1, MAP1LC3B,
CAIX and HIF1A-expression levels assessed using
quantitative PCR (Supplementary Methods).

Patients with metastatic TNBC and gene
expression profiling
Four women with metastatic TNBC, different from
the 78 other patients, participated in this study.
For each patient, five samples of a metastasis were
obtained during the procedure of imaging-guided biopsy
at the time of relapse, before any medical treatment.
Informed written consent was obtained from the patients.
The Clinical Research Board Ethics Committee approved
this study (CPP Ile-de-France N°13218).
Among the five tumor samples, i) two were
formaldehyde-fixed
and
paraffin-embedded
for
histological analyses, ii) two were immediately snapfrozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in Hôpital-St-Louis
Tumorbank for molecular analysis, iii) and one was set
aside in culture medium for xenografting.

Necrosis assessment in human tumor samples
The 78 pre-treatment biopsies were reviewed by two
pathologists unaware of response to treatment (AJ, CL) for
the presence or absence of necrotic areas. When present in
any field of the two different sections analyzed for each
biopsy, necrosis was delineated on virtual slides created
on a Nanozoomer2.0H scanner (Hamamatsu/Japan),
and quantified using DotSlide2 software. Results were
expressed as the sum of necrotic areas for each biopsy,
and the mean ± SEM.

were obtained after 48 h of culture in a humidified chamber
(37°C, 5% CO2) under normoxia (20% O2) for further
in vitro functional experiments and in vivo tumorigenicity
experiments (Supplementary Figure 4). For cytotoxicity
tests, see Supplementary Methods.

Experimental hypoxia, assessment of stem-cell
markers and of mammosphere sensitivity to

Patient-derived breast cancer xenografts and
treatments

For the two xenograft models, XBC1 or XBC4,
spheres were separated into two groups maintained in
a humidified chamber for 48 h, one under experimental
hypoxia (1% O2) and the other under normoxia (20% O2).
For experimental hypoxia, we chose a pO2 level of 1% as
it is now accepted that stem-cell niches are hypoxic with
oxygen tension as low as 1% [54].
The relative number of CD133 and CD146
expressing cells in hypoxic and normoxic spheres was
assessed by flow cytometry, and for cytotoxicity, MTT test
was performed (Supplementary Methods).

Four patient-derived xenografts of human TNBC
were studied (XBC1 to XBC4). They had been established
for a pilot study on personalized treatment for women
with metastatic triple negative breast carcinoma [53],
before any medical treatment of the metastatic disease
(Supplementary Methods).
The University Institute Board Ethics Committee for
experimental animal studies approved this study (N°201215/728-0115).
For each xenograft model, the day when tumors
reached a volume of 300mm3 – i.e. 100% tumor volume –
was considered as Day0. Mice (n = 5 mice per treatment
group) were then treated over 28 days with three types
of chemotherapy (Supplementary Table 6 for drugs tested
in TNBC xenografted mice). A daily clinical score was
recorded and tumor growth was measured weekly until
tumor weight reached the ethically recommended limit of
less than 10% of mouse weight (Directive 2010/63/EU of
European Parliament and Council of 22 September 2010
on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes;
Official Journal of European Union L 276/33).

Experimental hypoxia and autophagy in spheres
Total RNA was extracted from normoxic and
hypoxic spheres. TaqMan RT-qPCR was performed to
determine BECN1 and BNIP3L gene expression levels.

Knock-out of autophagy gene expression in
spheres
Because of a 16-day lifetime of spheres derived from
patient-derived xenografts (XBC1 and XBC4 models),
CRISPR-CAS9 technology was chosen to invalidate
BECN1 and BNIP3L gene expression. A dedicated algorithm
(see http://crispr.mit.edu website) enabled us to choose
the target sequence of 20 bases around the active sites of
phosphorylation for each of the two genes. Oligos designed
to build the vectors containing the sgRNA1 targeting
BECN1 or BNIP3L genes are detailed in Supplementary
Table 7, and the method in Supplementary Methods.

Assessment of tumor response in patients
For each line of chemotherapy, the patient response
under treatment was characterized (Supplementary
Methods).

Cancer stem-cells from xenografted human
TNBC: spheres and cytotoxicity
We studied spheres obtained from untreated tumor
samples of XBC1 and XBC4 xenograft models.
Cells expressing CD133 were obtained from
dissociated sections using magnetic sorting, with antiCD133 micro-bead antibody (Miltenyi-Biotech, Germany),
using the manufacturer’s procedures. We controlled CD133
cell purity by flow cytometry. CD133 positive cells were placed
in a low-attachment six-well plate at a density of 2000 to
5000 cells/well, and cultured in a serum-free, high-glucose
medium (DMEM-F12, Gibco, France) supplemented
with 2% B27-NeuroMix and 0.4% fetal-bovine-serum
(PAA, France), 5 mg/mL insulin (Sigma, France),

Tumorigenicity of spheres KO for BECN1 or
BNIP3L
48 h after co-transfection with GFP and after
antibiotic selection, a volume of 10µL of culture medium
containing 2 × 105 cells dissociated from spheres was
transferred and spread on a specific plate dedicated to
laser-microdissection of living cells. Laser-microdissection
was performed using a PALM-Microbeam/Zeiss-system
equipped with a 480 nm wavelength filter. GFP-positive
fluorescent cells were catapulted one by one into a cap
with culture medium. GFP-negative cells were also
selected using the same process. For a given set of cells,
the procedure did not exceed 30 minutes. Selected cells
were rinsed, and a minimum of 200 GFP-expressing cells
were grafted subcutaneously in nude mice to assess the
tumorigenicity of cells transfected with sg1BECN1 or
sg1BNIP3L. Cells transfected with empty plasmid served
as the control. Mice were followed up over a period of 6
months in dedicated animal housing.
