ABSTRACT
Sarcomas are rare but highly aggressive mesenchymal tumors with a median
survival of 10–18 months for metastatic disease. Mutation and/or overexpression of
many receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including c-Met, PDGFR, c-Kit and IGF1-R drive
defective signaling pathways in sarcomas. MGCD516 (Sitravatinib) is a novel small
molecule inhibitor targeting multiple RTKs involved in driving sarcoma cell growth. In
the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of MGCD516 both in vitro and in mouse
xenograft models in vivo. MGCD516 treatment resulted in significant blockade of
phosphorylation of potential driver RTKs and induced potent anti-proliferative effects
in vitro. Furthermore, MGCD516 treatment of tumor xenografts in vivo resulted in
significant suppression of tumor growth. Efficacy of MGCD516 was superior to imatinib
and crizotinib, two other well-studied multi-kinase inhibitors with overlapping target
specificities, both in vitro and in vivo. This is the first report describing MGCD516 as
a potent multi-kinase inhibitor in different models of sarcoma, superior to imatinib
and crizotinib. Results from this study showing blockade of multiple driver signaling
pathways provides a rationale for further clinical development of MGCD516 for the
treatment of patients with soft-tissue sarcoma.

Recent understanding of genomic markers and
driver kinases in sarcoma has contributed to the advances
in sarcoma therapy with moderate success [9]. Targeted
therapies have been employed in many subtypes,
particularly in liposarcomas and gastrointestinal stromal
tumors (GIST) [10, 11]. CDK4, a cytosolic kinase
involved in cell cycle progression, is amplified in greater
than 90% of liposarcoma cases. A recent clinical trial
of Palbociclib, a selective CDK4 inhibitor, produced a
favorable progression-free survival rate in liposarcoma
[12]. Similar strategies using small molecule inhibitors
and antibody-based therapy against receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTKs) have been used with some success in
solid tumors [13] including sarcomas [14, 15]. Imatinib
mesylate, the first line of therapy for GIST, is a tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) targeted toward c-Kit, c-Abl, and
PDGFR, well-characterized oncogenic RTKs. Genotyping

INTRODUCTION
Sarcomas are a heterogeneous group of rare tumors
arising from embryonic mesodermal origin and presenting
as soft tissue and bone tumors [1, 2]. Despite making up
only about 1% of all cancer cases each year (about 14,000
cases), there are more than 50 currently characterized
types [1, 3–5]. The most common sarcomas include
leiomyosarcoma (20%), liposarcoma (17%) and synovial
sarcoma (14%) [6]. Other rare sarcomas, such as malignant
peripheral nerve sheath tumor, have an incidence rate of
about 5% [7]. First line of treatment for localized disease
is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy with or
without adjuvant chemotherapy. Metastatic disease,
however, requires intensive chemotherapy with great
toxicity and generally inadequate efficacy, leading to a
median survival from diagnosis of 10–18 months [8].

GIST allows for directed therapies depending on c-KIT
and PDGFR mutational status [10]. The response rates for
these targeted therapies are encouraging and pave the way
for the development of more specific therapies.
RTKs are key regulators of tumor development as
well as metastasis, aiding in the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, migration and angiogenesis. RTK signaling
pathways such as VEGFR, PDGFR, and c-Met have been
shown to be critical for cell survival, proliferation and
metastasis in sarcomas [9, 14]. Current therapies have
evolved from single tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such
as Bevacizumab [16] to angiokinase inhibitors targeting
VEGFR in addition to kinases such as PDGFR and c-Kit,
such as sunitinib, sorafenib [17] and BIBF1120 [18].
Even though TKIs have been used with moderate success
to block tumor cell survival and proliferation, activation
of compensatory signaling pathways gives rise to drug
resistance in a majority of cases [19, 20]. There is an
unmet need for potent multi-targeted kinase inhibitors that
may help overcome intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to
the traditional targeted therapies.
This present study is the first report describing the
in vitro and in vivo efficacy of MGCD516, a novel, broad
spectrum small molecule inhibitor that blocks a wide
array of RTKs known to be amplified/overexpressed
in sarcomas, including c-Kit, PDGFRβ [21], PDGFRα,
c-Met, and Axl [9, 19]. Reports of use of other multikinase inhibitors in sarcoma such as imatinib have not
been very encouraging [22] or restricted to a smaller
patient sub-population such as use of crizotinib in ALK
driven tumors [23]. We tested the efficacy of MGCD516
using a wide panel of sarcoma cell lines, including
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST),
Ewing sarcoma (A673), osteosarcoma (Saos2), and
liposarcoma (DDLS, LS141). Both in vitro and in vivo
efficacy of MGCD516 was significantly better that the
other two multi-kinase inhibitors, imatinib and crizotinib.
MGCD516 treatment not only inhibits tumor cell
proliferation at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro
but also results significant tumor growth suppression in
vivo in mouse xenograft models. Our findings strongly
suggest further clinical exploration of MGCD516 in
patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

RTKs tested included kinases from PDGFR, IGFR, Ephrin
(Eph), VEGFR and c-Met family among others. The
cell lines tested represent osteosarcoma (Saos2), Ewing
sarcoma (A673, CHP100), liposarcoma (DDLS, LS141),
malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), and
synovial sarcoma (SYO-1). Based on the results of the
preliminary data, we decided to include five cell lines for
further studies that showed basal expression levels for the
most number of receptor tyrosine kinases (Supplementary
Table S1). All five cell lines showed expression of EphA1,
EphB4 and VEGFR1 whereas expression levels of kinases
from other RTK families varied among different cell lines
(Figure 1A). While both liposarcoma cell lines (DDLS
and LS141) showed high levels of IGF1-R expression,
only MPNST cell line showed significant levels of
PDGFRα expression (Figure 1A). We next tested the basal
phosphorylation levels of RTKs in these five cell lines
grown in 10%FBS containing media using phospho-RTK
proteome profiler kit (R&D Systems, ARY001B). Among
the cell lines tested, A673, LS141 and Saos2 showed high
levels of phospho-IGF1-R, whereas, only two cell lines
(DDLS and MPNST) showed high basal phosphorylation
levels of c-Met (Figure 1B). Higher auto-radiographic
exposures showed presence of basal phosphorylation
levels of Eph (Ephrin) receptor kinases as well especially
in the cell lines A673 and MPNST (Supplementary
Figure S1). Even though we were able to detect basal
levels of expression (Figure 1A) and phosphorylation of
RYK (Figure 1B), an orphan atypical kinase related to
RTKs, it is highly unlikely that it plays any significant role
in driving sarcoma cell growth especially since it lacks
any catalytic activity of its own [24]. However, it has been
shown to be phosphorylated by Eph family of receptors
[24]. Taken together, there were multiple potential driver
kinases for each cell line with varying degrees of basal
expression and phosphorylation levels. The most common
RTKs with high basal expression levels in the sarcoma
cell lines tested were IGF1-R, c-Kit, c-Met and PDGFRb
(Figure 1A). These are also known to be the more
canonical sarcoma driver kinases [21, 25, 26].

RESULTS

Figures 1A and 1B clearly indicate the complexity of
signaling pathways in sarcoma cells and demonstrate the
need for therapies that target multiple RTKs. MGCD516
is a potent broad-spectrum RTK inhibitor (Figure 1C) with
multiple targets including Axl, c-Met, Ephrin receptor
family (EphA1, A2, B1, B2, B4), as well as PDGFR and
VEGFR family of kinases (Table 1). Many of the targets
inhibited by MGCD516 are among the known potential
driver kinases in sarcoma [9]. Therefore, we explored
anti-proliferative effect of MGCD516 in five sarcoma
cell lines used in Figure 1. As shown in Figure 2A,
all the cell lines tested were sensitive to increasing

for the less sensitive cell lines (A673 and Saos2) ranged
between 1.5–2.0 mmol/L (Supplementary Table S2). Next
we tested the inhibition of RTK signaling by MGCD516
using western immunoblotting by treating the cells with
increasing concentrations of the drug. Figure 2B shows
complete inhibition of phosphorylation of the targets
including c-Met, IGF1-R, and PDGFRb at low nanomolar
concentrations ranging from 60–500 nmol/L. In addition
to the down-regulation of RTK phosphorylation, we also
observed significant down-regulation of p-AKT (Ser473)
with increasing concentrations of MGCD516 (Figure 2B).
In order to confirm blockade of phosphorylation
of multiple RTKs by MGCD516, we next carried out
phospho-RTK proteome profiler array analysis. MGCD516
treatment resulted in significant down-regulation of RTK
phosphorylation including the canonical RTKs PDGFRα,
PDGFRβ, IGF1-R and c-Met (Figure 3). There was also
a marked reduction in phosphorylation of RTKs such as
Axl and ALK which have also been reported as potential
driver kinases in sarcoma [9]. Interestingly, MGCD516
demonstrated inhibition of RTKs including IGF1R and ALK
that were not potently inhibited in RTK enzymatic assays
(Table 1) suggesting that the inhibitory effects observed for
these kinases may be mediated via heterodimerization with
direct RTK targets of MGCD516 such as c-Met [27].
Results from cell proliferation, western
immunoblotting as well as phospho-RTK array analysis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

confirmed that MGCD516 is a broad-spectrum multikinase inhibitor that results in potent anti-proliferative
effects as well as significant down-regulation of its targets
at low nanomolar concentrations in vitro.

MGCD516 is superior to other multi-kinase
inhibitors in inhibiting cell proliferation, RTK
phosphorylation, and phosphorylation of
downstream effectors in vitro
Next, we compared MGCD516 against other
multi-kinase inhibitors, which have overlapping
target specificity. First, we evaluated the efficacy of
MGCD516 in the three sensitive cell lines (DDLS,
LS141 and MPNST) against pazopanib, a drug recently
approved for the treatment of sarcoma [28]. Our results
(Figure 4A) showed that MGCD516 treatment was
able to inhibit proliferation of LS141 and DDLS cell
lines significantly better than pazopanib especially
at 1000 nM/L concentration (p<0.0005) suggesting
better pathway inhibition by MGCD516. Inhibition of
MPNST cell proliferation was similar for pazopanib
and MGCD516 (Figure 4A) given the ability of both
pazopanib and MGCD516 to inhibit PDGFR and c-Kit,
the two main RTKs driving MPNST cell proliferation
[29]. Next, we determined the efficacy of MGCD516

against crizotinib, an ALK and c-Met inhibitor, and
imatinib, a PDGFR and c-Kit inhibitor. Based on
the IC50 value determination (Supplementary Table
S2), we decided to use 500 nmol/L of all the tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Treatment with MGCD516
showed significant inhibition of proliferation as
compared to crizotinib in all the three cell lines tested
(p<0.005) (Figure 4B). In MPNST, treatment with
imatinib showed anti-proliferative effect similar to
MGCD516 again highlighting the role of c-Kit and
PDGFR as driver kinases in this cell line as has been
reported previously [29]. For all three cell lines tested,
combined treatment with imatinib and crizotinib showed
similar anti-proliferative effect as that of MGCD516
(Figure 4B) strongly indicating that MGCD516 is
efficient in blocking multiple RTKs that the other two
drugs block individually.
Western blot analysis comparing MGCD516
against imatinib and crizotinib either alone or in
combination, in the two sensitive cell lines DDLS
and MPNST, showed that MGCD516 was efficient in
blocking multiple RTKs and showed significantly better
inhibition of downstream effectors such as p-AKT
(Ser473) than the other two drugs (Figure 4C). We also
compared the efficacy of MGCD516 against imatinib and
crizotinib using a colony formation assay as a measure
of tumorigenicity. In MPNST cell line, treatment with
MGCD516 at 500 nmol/L, concentration similar to
the one used for cell proliferation assay comparisons,
resulted in significant reduction in colony number
compared to no drug control as well as compared to
imatinib and crizotinib treatment alone (p<0.05, Figure
4D). Similar to the results obtained in Figure 4B,
effect of imatinib and crizotinib combination treatment
was comparable to MGCD516 alone (Figure 4D).
Furthermore, comparison against two structurally similar
drugs, carbozantinib [30] and foretinib [31], showed that
MGCD516 had a significantly higher anti-proliferative
effect (p < 0.05, Supplementary Figure S2A).
Many small-molecule RTK inhibitors including
sorafenib and lapatinib have been considered as cytostatic
agents rather than cytotoxic drugs [32]. To test whether
the inhibition of cell proliferation by MGCD516 is due
to cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects, we carried
out flow cytometry cell-cycle analysis after MGCD516
treatment in MPNST cell line. Treatment with increasing
concentrations of MGCD516 induced a significant G1
cell-cycle arrest (Supplementary Figure S2B, left panel).
Down-regulation of cyclin D1 has been reported to play a
role in G1 cell-cycle arrest in other cancer cell lines [33].
Western blot analysis after treatment with MGCD516
induced significant down-regulation of cyclin D1 and
a significant decrease in hyperphosphorylated form of
retinoblastoma protein (p-Rb) but no induction of cleaved
PARP was seen (Supplementary Figure S2B, right panel)

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

thus indicating that MGCD516 is a cytostatic than a
cytotoxic drug.
Considering the complexities of signaling pathways
in sarcoma, we also tested MGCD516 in combination
with doxorubicin, a commonly used chemotherapeutic
agent. Combination treatment with doxorubicin, at two
different concentrations, 10 nM/L and 100 nM/L did not
show any significant inhibition of cell proliferation by
MGCD516 compared with MGCD516 treatment alone
(Supplementary Figure S2C).

Inhibitory effect of MGCD516 can be replicated
by siRNA mediated knockdown of multiple
RTKs
In order to confirm the role played by potential
driver RTKs in each of the three cell lines (DDLS, LS141
and MPNST), we next carried out siRNA mediated
knockdown of these kinases either alone or in combination
and compared the anti-proliferative effect against
MGCD516 treatment. While DDLS and MPNST showed
higher basal levels of c-Met and PDGFRβ (Figure 1A),
LS141 cell line showed high basal levels of IGF1-R and
PDGFRβ. Therefore, we carried out siRNA mediated
knockdown of c-Met and PDGFRβ in DDLS and MPNST
and IGF1-R and PDGFRβ in LS141 either alone or in
combination. Transfection using pooled siRNAs resulted
in almost complete knockdown of protein expression
(Figure 5A, 5B, 5C and 5D, right panel). Cell viability
assays clearly showed that siRNA mediated combined
knockdown of the potential driver kinases had a significant
anti-proliferative effect compared to scrambled siRNA in
all the three cell lines tested (p<0.005) (Figure 5A, 5B,
5C and 5D, bar graphs). This anti-proliferative effect was
comparable to MGCD516 treatment strongly suggesting
that blockade of RTK phosphorylation by MGCD516 is
comparable to blockade achieved using siRNA mediated
knockdown. For MPNST cell line, combined knockdown
of c-Met and PDGFRβ showed lesser anti-proliferative
effect (Figure 5B), however, as shown previously [29],
combined knockdown of PDGFRβ and c-Kit resulted
in similar anti-proliferative effect as that of MGCD516
(Figure 5C) suggesting a role of these two RTKs in driving
MPNST cell proliferation. Also, for LS141 cell line,
combined blockade of IGF1-R and PDGFRβ, showed
significantly higher anti-proliferative effect than 500
nmol/L MGCD516 treatment (Figure 4D). This could in
part be due to the fact that the drug concentration used
(500 nmol/L) is lower than the IC50 concentration observed
for LS141 (Supplementary Table S2) as well as higher
biochemical IC50 value noted for IGF1-R (Table 1) in
vitro. In addition, as mentioned earlier, IGF1-R may not be
a direct target of the drug; instead the effect could be due
to blockade of signaling resulting from heterodimerization
of IGFR with other RTK targets of MGCD516 [27].

MGCD516 induces significant tumor growth
suppression than imatinib and crizotinib in vivo

therapeutic agents that will target multiple RTKs in order
to block such compensatory signaling pathways thereby
preventing development of drug resistance.
MGCD516 is a novel, small molecule inhibitor that
has broad spectrum activity against many of the canonical
RTKs including c-Met, VEGFR, Axl, Ephrin receptors
(Eph), c-Kit and PDGFR. The biochemical IC50 values
for many of these RTKs lie in the low nanomolar range
(1–200 nmol/L). In the present study, we were able to
detect varying levels of expression and phosphorylation
of many of the MGCD516 targets such as c-Met, Axl and
PDGFR as well as VEGFR and Eph receptors in all five
sarcoma cell lines tested. When we evaluated the efficacy
of MGCD516 in a cell proliferation assay, we observed
increased sensitivity with increasing doses of the drug
with IC50 values ranging in the low nanomolar range
(250–800 nmol/L) for three out of five cell lines (DDLS,
LS141 and MPNST). It must be noted though that two
of the five cell lines tested (A673 and Saos2) were less
sensitive to inhibition by MGCD516 than the other cell
lines. This could probably be due to the fact that A673
cell line, in addition to having high basal expression and
phosphorylation levels of many RTKs (IGF1-R, ErbB4,
EphA4, EphA10, and ALK), also carries a (BRAF V600E)
mutation which could potentially play a role in reduced
sensitivity to the drug. For Saos2 cell line, not only were
we able to detect lesser number of MGCD516 targets on
western blot but also high basal phosphorylation levels
of IGF1-R on phospho-RTK array. In vitro IC50 value for
IGF1-R inhibition by MGCD516 is much higher (3980
nmol/L) compared to other RTKs such as c-Met (20
nmol/L) or PDGFRα (30 nmol/L) indicating that cell lines
with IGF1-R as the sole driver kinase may exhibit reduced
sensitivity to the drug. Direct inhibition of IGF1-R activity
was not seen in the in vitro enzymatic assays, suggesting
that the reduction in phosphorylation could be a result of
blockade of heterodimerization with other MGCD516
targets such as c-Met [27].
Multi-kinase inhibitors including imatinib, which
blocks RTKs such as c-Kit and PDGFR, have been
used in sarcoma clinical trials with modest success
[22]. Crizotinib, which inhibits c-Met and ALK, is also
being tested in clinical trials (Clinical Trial Identifier
NCT01524926) for sarcoma. Pazopanib, an antiangiogenic agent, that blocks multiple driver RTKs
including c-Kit, VEGFR, PDGFR as well as kinases from
FGFR family, was recently approved for the treatment of
soft-tissue sarcoma [28, 44]. However, one of the reasons
for limited success with such multi-kinase inhibitors is
the ability of tumors to activate alternate/escape pathways
that are not the primary targets of the drug. MGCD516 is
unique in a way that it has broad spectrum activity against
many RTKs including c-Met, c-Kit, Axl, PDGFR, and Eph
receptors that are known to play a role in driving sarcoma
cell growth, and thus, it is able to inhibit many of the
internal compensatory pathways. Our studies comparing

Next, we carried out in vivo mouse xenograft
experiments using MPNST and LS141 models. In order
to be consistent with our in vitro data, we compared
MGCD516 treatment against imatinib and crizotinib in
vivo. Treatment with any of the drugs including MGCD516
did not result in toxicity as determined by animal weight
during the study period (Supplementary Figure S3). In both
MPNST and LS141 xenograft experiments, MGCD516
treatment resulted in significant suppression of tumor
growth compared to vehicle control (p<0.0005) as well
as compared against imatinib and crizotinib (Figure 6A
and 6B) (p<0.005). Western blot analysis of tissue samples
obtained after 3 weeks of treatment showed greater
inhibition of phosphorylation of potential driver kinases
such as c-Kit, IGF1-R and PDGFRβ compared to imatinib
and crizotinib as well as significant down-regulation of
downstream effector pathways such as p-AKT (Ser473)
and p-S6 (Ser235/236) (Figure 6A and 6B). To test the
effect of MGCD516 treatment on proliferating tumor cells,
we tested Ki67 as a proliferation marker on formalin fixed
tumor tissues. Tumor samples treated with MGCD516 for
3 weeks showed significantly less Ki67 staining compared
to vehicle control (Figure 6C). Reduction in Ki67 staining
indicated strong anti-proliferative effect of MGCD516.

DISCUSSION
Sarcomas represent a diverse set of malignancies
that are difficult to treat given the complexities of
various subtypes. Sarcomas are traditionally categorized
into two broad categories: tumors with translocations
or activating mutations, whereas, the second category
includes more complex tumors showing multiple
genomic aberrations [34]. Genetically more complex
group includes some of the more commonly diagnosed
sarcomas such as leiomyosarcoma, and osteosarcoma.
Many sarcoma subtypes belonging to both these
categories show aberration and/or mutation in signal
transduction pathways, particularly defects in receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling [34, 35]. Recent evidence
suggests involvement of RTKs such as PDGFR [29, 36,
37], c-Met [38], Axl [39], IGF1-R [40], EphB4 [41] and
ErbB4 [42] as driver kinases in different sarcoma subtypes
including synovial sarcoma, Ewing sarcoma as well
as malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).
Detailed phosphoproteomic analysis from cell lines and
patient tumors also revealed involvement of RTKs such
as PDGFR, Eph receptors, Axl, c-Met and IGF1-R [9] as
potential driver kinases in sarcomas. Even though RTKs
present an attractive therapeutic target [14], in many
cases, cells rapidly acquire resistance via compensatory
activation and/or mutation of signaling pathways [43].
Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel

MGCD516 against imatinib and crizotinib showed that
MGCD516 was clearly superior to the other two drugs in
terms of inhibition of cell proliferation as well as blockade
of signaling pathways. Interestingly, combination of
imatinib and crizotinib showed similar anti-proliferative
effect as that of MGCD516 alone strongly suggesting that
MGCD516 is able to block multiple RTKs that imatinib
and crizotinib block individually.
In the present study, we also carried out silencing of
the target RTKs using siRNA mediated approach to verify
that blockade of RTK signaling by MGCD516 was indeed
responsible for inhibition of cell proliferation in DDLS,
LS141, and MPNST cell lines. Combination of siRNAs
against potential driver RTKs resulted in comparable
inhibition of cell proliferation as that of MGCD516
treatment. In MPNST cell line, combined knockdown of
PDGFRβ and c-Kit but not c-Met resulted in similar antiproliferative effect as that of MGCD516 indicating a role
of these two RTKs in driving MPNST cell proliferation
as shown previously [29]. In LS141 cell line, siRNA
mediated knockdown of IGF1-R and PDGFRβ resulted
in higher inhibition of proliferation than MGCD516
treatment, presumably due to the fact that the IC50 value
for IGF1-R inhibition by MGCD516 is much higher
than for other kinases. Nevertheless, these results clearly
indicate that MGCD516 is efficient in blocking multiple
pathways that are critical for sarcoma cell proliferation
and this effect can be mimicked by siRNA mediated
knockdown of individual RTKs.
Similar to the anti-proliferative effect observed,
MGCD516 showed significant inhibition of colony growth
and has a greater inhibitory effect on cell colonization than
imatinib and crizotinib treatment alone, potentially owing
to its greater broad-spectrum activity.
Sustained inhibition of RTKs such as c-Kit and
PDGFR has been shown to suppress tumor growth in
MPNST [29]. Results from our in vivo data showed that
MGCD516 treatment results in significant suppression
of tumor growth compared to the other two drugs in
both MPNST as well as LS141 xenograft models.
Immunohistochemical studies using Ki67 staining as
a marker for cell proliferation showed that MGCD516
treatment indeed resulted in decreased cellular
proliferation. Western immunoblotting showed that
MGCD516 treatment not only resulted in significant
blockade of phosphorylation of multiple RTKs such
as PDGFR, c-Kit and IGF1-R but also inhibited
downstream effectors such as p-AKT and p-S6 which
are critical for tumor cell survival and proliferation.
Since MGCD516 can inhibit RTKs such as PDGFR
and VEGFR, we speculate that the significant tumor
suppression achieved in vivo is not only limited to
inhibition of signaling pathways in tumor cells but
also due to an effect on stromal cell signaling mediated
via these kinases. Even though MGCD516 does show
inhibition of VEGFR family in vitro, differentiated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

effects are observed from other more well-studied
VEGFR inhibitors such as sunitinib, which do not share
additional MGCD516 targets (personal communication
with Dr. James Christensen, Mirati Therapeutics).
Interestingly, crizotinib treatment in LS141 xenografts
showed greater tumor growth than vehicle control
perhaps as a result of activation of other RTKs such as
increased phospho-c-Kit and phospho-IGF1-R signal
seen on western immunoblotting.
Taken together, our data strongly suggest that
broad spectrum inhibition of multiple RTK signaling
pathways by MGCD516 both in vitro and in vivo results
in superior activity compared to imatinib and crizotinib.
Significant down-regulation of downstream pathways
such as p-AKT and p-S6 also contributed to higher tumor
growth suppression in vivo. This is the first pre-clinical
report describing MGCD516 (Sitravatinib) as a potent
and broad spectrum inhibitor of RTKs. A phase I trial
with MGCD516 is already underway and results from
this present study can be extended to other RTK driven
solid tumors. We believe that our data would support the
development of MGCD516 as a potential therapy for
patients with soft-tissue sarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Drugs
MGCD516 (Sitravatinib) was provided by Mirati
Therapeutics (San Diego, CA) in the form of powder;
it was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for in
vitro studies. Vehicle and MGCD516 were prepared
to a final concentration of 0.5% hydroxypropyl
methylcellulose (HPMC) and 0.1% Tween-80 solution
(pH 1.4) for xenograft studies. Both imatinib and
crizotinib, purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn,
MA), were dissolved in DMSO for in vitro experiments
and formulated in water for in vivo experiments.

Cell lines
Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell
lines (MPNST, ST8814) were supplied by Dr. Jonathan
Fletcher (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA).
MPNST and ST8814 cell lines were authenticated as
previously described [29]. Ewing sarcoma (CHP100,
A673) cell lines were obtained from Dr. Melinda S.
Merchant (Center for Cancer Research, NCI/NIH,
Bethesda, MD). Dedifferentiated liposarcoma cell lines
(LS141, DDLS) were obtained from Dr. Samuel Singer
[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC),
New York, NY], and were authenticated by gene
expression profiling before distribution [45]. Synovial
sarcoma cell lines (SYO-1 and HSSY-II) were obtained
from Dr. Marc Ladanyi (MSKCC). Osteosarcoma
cell line (Saos2) was obtained from ATCC. All cell

lines except SYO-1 were cultured in RPMI media
with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin, maintained at 37°C in 5% CO2, and
passaged for no more than 4 months. SYO-1 cell line
was maintained in DME media with 10% FBS, 100 U/
mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin, maintained
at 37°C in 5% CO2. Initial stocks of all cell lines were
received from their sources within the past 3 years. Cell
lines CHP100 and A673 were authenticated using RTPCR, and found to have their expected characteristic
chromosomal translocations. SYO-1 and HSSY-II cell
lines were authenticated by confirming the expression of
the pathognomonic SYT-SSX fusion gene by RT-PCR.
All cell lines were determined to be mycoplasma free
via testing in the MSKCC Monoclonal Antibody Core
Facility using biochemical assay MycoAlert.

Phospho-RTK analysis was carried out according to
manufacturer’s instructions (R&D systems, ARY001B).
Briefly, 1 × 106 cells were plated in no serum media
overnight (unless otherwise indicated) in 60mm plates.
Next day, indicated concentrations of drugs were added
in no serum media. After 3 hours of treatment, cells were
stimulated using 10%FBS containing media (no serum
media was used as unstimulated control) for 1 hour. Cells
were then washed once with sterile PBS, lysed in NP40
lysis buffer and approximately 200–300 μg of lysates
were loaded on blocked phospho-RTK array membranes
overnight. Phospho-RTK array co-ordinates can be found
at www.rndsystems.com/pdf/ary001B.pdf.

Gene silencing

Cell viability assay

50 nM siRNAs (pooled siRNAs, Dharmacon)
specific for human IGF-1R, c-Met and PDGFRβ were
transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Invitrogen). Scrambled (non-targeting pool) siRNA
was used as control. 48 hours after transfections, cells
were trypsinized, counted using a Nexcelom cell counter
and plated in 96-well plates for cell viability assays as
described. Cells were also collected, lysed and analyzed by
western blot to check for knockdown of protein expression.

Cell viability assays were carried out with the
Dojindo Molecular Technologies Kit per manufacturer's
instructions. Briefly, 2,000–3,000 cells were plated in
96-well plates in RPMI/DME media with 10% FBS and
then treated with the indicated drugs the next day. After
72 hours, media was replaced with 100 μL of media with
10% serum and 10% CCK-8 solution (Dojindo Molecular
Technologies Kit). After 1 hour, the optical density was
read at 450 nm using a Spectra Max 340 PC (Molecular
Devices Corp.) to determine viability. Background values
from negative control wells without cells were subtracted
for final sample quantification. Data was plotted as % cell
viability compared to DMSO (No Drug, ND) control. IC50
was extrapolated from cell viability data using CompuSyn
software according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Colony assay
1,000 cells were plated, in triplicate, onto 100
mm dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells were
treated for 24 hours with the indicated drugs. Following
treatment, cells were cultured in drug-free media for 10 to
14 days. The resulting colonies were fixed in 20% ethanol
and stained with 2.5% crystal violet. Colonies were
scored with ColCount software from Oxford Optronix
(Abingdon, UK).

Western blots
Western blots were carried out as previously
described [46]. Briefly, cell lysates were prepared by
washing the cells once with sterile PBS followed by
scraping in radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis
buffer. For xenograft tissues, lysates were prepared by
cutting the snap frozen tumor tissue into a small piece
and then grinding it in RIPA lysis buffer using sample
grinding kit (GE Healthcare). Protein concentrations were
measured using Bio-Rad protein assay dye (Bio-Rad) and
equal amounts of protein (20–30 mg) were loaded on 4%12% gradient gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to PVDF
membrane (Immobilon, Millipore) or Nitrocellulose
(ThermoFisher) for the detection of phosphorylated c-Kit.
After blocking with 5% milk, membranes were probed with
primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Bound antibodies
were detected with horseradish peroxidase secondary
antibodies (GE Healthcare) and visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare). Antibodies
for western immunoblotting were purchased from Cell
Signaling Technology unless otherwise mentioned.

Xenograft studies
Briefly, LS141 and MPNST xenografts were
transplanted subcutaneously in the flank of ICR/SCID
mice. Once tumors reached a volume of 80–100 mm3,
the mice were randomized into different groups of 7–10
animals each and treated with the indicated drugs or
vehicle control. Crizotinib was dosed at a concentration
of 50 mg/kg i.p. QD, 5 days a week. Imatinib was dosed
at a concentration of 30 mg/kg i.p. QD, 5 days a week.
MGCD516 was dosed at a concentration of 15 mg/kg
p.o. QD, 5 days a week. Tumor size was measured twice
weekly by caliper. The average tumor volume in each
group was expressed in cubic millimeter and calculated
using the formula p/6 × (large diameter) × (small
diameter)2. After 3 weeks of drug treatment, 3 animals
in each group were sacrificed and the resected tumors
were divided for formalin fixation (for hematoxylin/eosin

staining and IHC) and snap frozen tissue (for western
blot). Experiments were carried out under an Institutional
Animal Care (MSKCC) and Use Committee–approved
protocol, and institutional guidelines for the proper and
humane use of animals were followed.
