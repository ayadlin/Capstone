ABSTRACT
The underlying mechanisms responsible for the development of castrationresistant prostate cancer (CRPC) in patients who have undergone androgen
deprivation therapy are not fully understood. This is the first study to address whether
β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2)- mediated signaling may affect CRPC progression
in vivo. By immunohistochemical analyses, we observed that low levels of ADRB2 is
associated with a more rapid development of CRPC in a Norwegian patient cohort.
To elucidate mechanisms by which ADRB2 may affect CRPC development, we stably
transfected LNCaP cells with shRNAs to mimic low and high expression of ADRB2.
Two UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, involved in phase II
metabolism of androgens, were strongly downregulated in two LNCaP shADRB2
cell lines. The low-ADRB2 LNCaP cell lines displayed lowered glucuronidation
activities towards androgens than high-ADRB2 cells. Furthermore, increased levels
of testosterone and enhanced androgen responsiveness were observed in LNCaP
cells expressing low level of ADRB2. Interestingly, these cells grew faster than highADRB2 LNCaP cells, and sustained their low glucuronidation activity in castrated NOD/

SCID mice. ADRB2 immunohistochemical staining intensity correlated with UGT2B15
staining intensity in independent TMA studies and with UGT2B17 in one TMA study.
Similar to ADRB2, we show that low levels of UGT2B15 are associated with a more
rapid CRPC progression. We propose a novel mechanism by which ADRB2 may affect
the development of CRPC through downregulation of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17.

INTRODUCTION

progression [20]. Low levels of ADRB2 in prostate cancer
tissue were found to correlate with biochemical recurrence
measured as increasing prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
levels, or metastatic disease after radical prostatectomy.
Conversely, our group has recently reported an association
between the use of β-blockers (ADRB antagonists) and
improved prostate cancer specific survival both for
patients who have undergone ADT [21] and for patients
with high risk or metastatic disease [22].
Our knowledge about the potential role of the
ADRB2 in prostate cancer and CRPC development is still
limited. Therefore, in this study, we have addressed this
topic by performing immunohistochemical analyses and
investigated the potential role of ADRB2 in development
of CRPC in ADRB2 knockdown cell lines.

Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the first
line of treatment for patients with advanced or metastatic
prostate cancer [1]. ADT is initially effective in controlling
tumor growth and symptoms, but most tumors eventually
develop resistance to ADT and become castration
resistant prostate cancers (CRPC). Over the last years,
it has become evident that the androgen signaling axis
plays a pivotal role in the development of CRPC [2]. The
multiple molecular mechanisms by which the androgen
receptor (AR) contributes to disease progression despite
castration levels of androgens in prostate cancer have
been thoroughly reviewed [3-6]. Several new targets
in the AR activation pathway have emerged in recent
years [7, 8]. The steroidogenic pathway has received
increasing attention, as drugs targeting this pathway, such
as abiraterone (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450, family
17, subfamily A, polypeptide 1 (CYP17)) improve the life
expectancy of patients with CRPC, despite the assumed
androgen-independence of these cancer cases [8]. No
curative options for CRPC are, however, available today.
Increased knowledge of the mechanisms by which the
cancer cells progress to CRPC is hence needed. Recently,
targeting the androgen extrahepatic phase-II metabolic
pathways has arisen as a potential tool to help maintain
androgen-deprived conditions during ADT [9]. The UDPglucuronosyltransferases 2B15 (UGT2B15) and 2B17
(UGT2B17) are of special interest, as they are expressed
in prostate tissue and cell lines, and they exhibit specificity
for androgen metabolites [10].
The β2-adrenergic receptor (ADRB2) and its
downstream effectors cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMPdependent protein kinase A (PKA) have been implicated
in prostate cancer progression and AR signaling [11]. In
particular, sympathetic stimulation of ADRB2 has been
shown to potentially sensitize AR in cell lines under
androgen depleted conditions [12], suggesting that
ADRB2 might play a role in the development of CRPC.
Furthermore, a number of target genes are common for
the androgen and the PKA signaling cascades [13], and in
steroidogenic cells both cAMP and PKA have been shown
to regulate transcription of steroidogenic genes such as
CYP17 and STAR [14-16], as well as to modulate their
activity at the protein level [17].
While most pre-clinical evidence points towards a
tumor promoting role of β-adrenergic signaling [18, 19], a
previous study by Yu et al. reported an inverse correlation
between ADRB2 expression levels and prostate cancer

RESULTS
Low ADRB2 expression level in tumor tissue is
associated with poor prognosis after androgen
deprivation therapy
Tissue from 45 prostate cancer patients who had
received hormonal therapy and had been treated with
transurethral resection of the prostate (TUR-P) at Oslo
University Hospital, Aker (the Oslo ADT cohort) were
included in a tissue micro-array study. Five patients
were excluded due to lack of cancerous tissue following
staining with anti-ADRB2 antibody. The mean follow-up
from initiation of ADT for the 40 patients included in the
survival analyses was 71 months. For prostate cancerspecific mortality the mean follow-up was 70 months,
as we lacked information on the cause of death for four
patients. Patient and tumor characteristics at time of
diagnosis are shown in Supplementary Table 2. Examples
of negative and strong ADRB2 staining of two specimens
with Gleason score 9 are shown in Figure 1a and 1b.
Kaplan-Meier plots showing time to CRPC development
and prostate cancer- specific mortality in patients stratified
according to staining intensity above and below mean are
shown in Figure 1c and 1d. Competing risk regression
modelling showed that increasing staining intensity was
associated with increased time to CRPC development,
with an adjusted SHR of 0.67 (95% CI 0.46-0.97, p-value
0.035; adjusted for age at initiation of ADT and Gleason
score) (Table 1). For prostate cancer- specific mortality,
the association was not statistically significant (adjusted

and 2), as well as a non-targeting shRNA plasmid
(shCtrl). Real-Time RT-PCR analyses on mRNA isolated
from shADRB2 and shCtrl cells revealed a 50% and
95% reduction of ADRB2 mRNA in shADRB2-1 and
shADRB2-2, respectively, compared to shCtrl (Figure
2a). Radiolabeled ligand-binding assay measuring
125
I-cyanopindolol (CYP)-binding to membrane-bound
ADRBs confirmed the knockdown, with 50% and 85%
lowered ADRB binding activity in shADRB2-1 and
shADRB2-2 cells, respectively (Figure 2b). The receptor
acts primarily through stimulating adenylyl cyclase (AC)
activity, resulting in increased cAMP levels. The basal
(non-stimulated) rate of conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [32P]
cAMP was significantly lowered in both shADRB2-1 and
2 as shown in Figure 2c. Furthermore, stimulation with
the non-selective ADRB-agonist isoproterenol showed a

larger absolute and relative increase in adenylyl cyclase
activity in shCtrl compared to both shADRB2 cell lines,
indicating a functional effect of reduced ADRB2 levels.
LNCaP shADRB2-2 and shCtrl cells were injected
into NOD-SCID mice. The mice were castrated when
the tumor diameter reached 10-12 mm and the tumor
growth was followed in castrated mice for up to 42 days.
After a brief lag period, the shADRB2-2 tumors grew
more rapidly after castration, as shown in Figure 3a.
Although the ten mice in the shADRB2-2 group had nonsignificantly smaller tumors than the eleven mice in the
shCtrl group at time of castration, the shADRB2-2 tumors
were larger 28 days after castration. The change in tumor
volume from day 0 to day 42 was 3.5 fold higher in the
shADRB2-2 compared to the shCtrl group (Figure 3b).

Knockdown of ADRB2 in LNCaP cells is
associated with reduced androgen glucuronidation
activity

formation in shADRB2-1 cells, and a 95% fold lowering
in shADRB2-2 cells. Glucuronidation activity in positive
(human liver homogenates) and negative (HEK293 cell
homogenates) controls is shown in Supplementary Figure
1.
These findings led us to investigate whether
castration of mice injected with LNCaP shCtrl or
shADRB2-2 cells had an effect on the expression
and activity of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in vivo.
Immunohistochemical staining of tumor tissue from the
xenograft study using anti-UGT2B15 and anti-UGT2B17
antibodies showed that the phenotypic differences between
shCtrl and shADRB2-2 cells were maintained also after
castration (Figure 5a). UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 staining
intensities were statistically significantly higher in
shCtrl tumors than shADRB2-2 tumors (p = 0.006 and
p = 0.0004 for UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, respectively).
UGT2B17 negatively correlated to average daily growth
of the tumors (correlation coefficient -0,518, p = 0.016),
whereas UGT2B15 did not (correlation coefficient -0.188,
p = 0.41). Furthermore, the glucuronidation activity in
tumor extracts was on average 85% lower in shADRB2
xenograft mice compared to shCtrl mice (Figure 5b-5e).

We performed gene expression profiling of the
LNCaP shADRB2 and shCtrl cells to aid in elucidating
potential mechanisms explaining the association between
ADRB2 and CRPC development, as well as the increased
growth of the shADRB2 xenograft tumors. From this
microarray analysis we observed differential expression
of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2B15 and 2B17 in
shADRB2 cells compared to the shCtrl cells (data not
shown). To corroborate the microarray data, we performed
Real-Time RT-PCR which showed that UGT2B15 was
down-regulated 5-fold and 6-fold, and UGT2B17 downregulated 10-fold and 20-fold, in shADRB2-1 and 2
respectively, relative to shCtrl (Figure 4a). The UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 protein levels were visualized by
immunoblotting analysis. Whereas both proteins showed
strong bands in shCtrl cells, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17
were virtually un-detectable in both shADRB2 cell lines
(Figure 4b).
Furthermore,
lowered
UGT2B15
and
UGT2B17 expression was accompanied by reduced
androgen glucuronide formation (Figure 4c-4f).

After confirming that lowered ADRB2 expression

change in the AR activity in the cells. DHT-stimulated
LNCaP shADRB2 and shCtrl cells transiently transfected
with the probasin-based promoter and luciferase reporter
construct 285-Pb-pEZX-PG04 revealed that shADRB2
cells had a higher relative androgen responsiveness than
shCtrl cells (7-fold and 4-fold in shADRB2-1 and 2,
respectively) (Figure 6a). Similar results were obtained

when the cells were pre-incubated for 96 hours in
hormone-deprived medium prior to stimulation (data not
shown). To test if the effect was caused by reduced level
of ADRB2, we rescued ADRB2 expression in shADRB2-1
and 2 using pCDNA3.1-ADRB2, constitutively expressing
the ADRB2 gene. The relative luciferase activity was
decreased by 80% and 50%, yielding the knockdown cells

more similar to shCtrl cells (Figure 6b). Furthermore,
we wanted to test if the effect observed with a probasinbased promoter (285-Pb-pEZX-PG04) could be replicated
with a different androgen responsive reporter plasmid
containing 7 kb of the 5’ upstream region of the PSA
promoter (pGL3/PSA). We transfected shADRB2 and
shCtrl cells with pGL3/PSA and measured relative
androgen responsiveness after stimulation with 10 nM
DHT or vehicle for 48 hours. As with 285-Pb-pEZXPG04, the androgen response of pGL3/PSA was higher
when transfected into shADRB2 cells than shCtrl cells

(2.5- and 1.8-fold higher in shADRB2-1 and shADRB2-2,
respectively) (Figure 6c).
Next, we were interested in seeing whether the
androgen responsiveness could be modulated by inhibiting
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 activity. We treated LNCaP
shCtrl cells with the UGT2B substrate diclofenac sodium
(DFS), which competitively inhibits UGT2B-action
towards androgens. Stimulation with 50 µM diclofenac
sodium induced a statistically significant 1.8-fold rise in
normalized 285-Pb-pEZX-PG04-driven luciferase activity
(Figure 6d).

Figure 6: Increased androgen responsiveness in LNCaP shADRB2 cell lines. a. LNCaP shADRB2-1, shADRB2-2 and shCtrl

cells were transfected with the androgen responsive element-containing luciferase reporter construct 285-Pb-pEZX-PG04. The following
day, cells were incubated in hormone-deprived medium containing 2% CSS supplemented with either 10 nM DHT or vehicle and further
incubated for 48 hours. The androgen responsiveness of 285-Pb-pEZX-PG04 in LNCaP shADRB2-1, shADRB2-2, and shCtrl cells are

The androgen responsiveness was non-significantly
higher in the shADRB2-1 cell line than in the shADRB2-2
cell line (Figure 6a). This might be due to the fact that the
androgen receptor is slightly induced in the shADRB2-1
cell line (measured by western immunoblotting of protein
extracts; Supplementary Figure 2). The androgen receptor
was not up-regulated in shADRB2-2 cells compared to
shCtrl.

stimulated for 48 hours with either 1 nM DHT, 1 nM
R1881, or vehicle, before harvesting and isolating total
RNA. The Real-Time RT-PCR reaction revealed that DHT
induced a significantly more pronounced response on PSA
mRNA in both shADRB2 cell lines than in shCtrl (Figure
7a). Stimulation with the non-glucuronidable synthetic
androgen R1881 resulted in a greater response in all the
cells compared to DHT, but there were no significant
differences between shADRB2 and shCtrl cells (Figure
7b). To substantiate these findings, we performed a similar
experiment where we measured secreted PSA in medium
from androgen-stimulated cells. Figure 7c shows the
androgen responsiveness from cells stimulated with DHT,
and Figure 7d shows the relative responses acquired with
R1881. As with PSA mRNA, only stimulation with DHT
yielded a significant difference in increased PSA-response
between shADRB2 cell lines and the shCtrl cell line.

Prostate-specific antigen responsiveness is
increased in ADRB2 knockdown LNCaP cells
We hypothesized that increased reporter-driven
androgen responsiveness would be mirrored by an
increase in the PSA response upon androgen stimulation.

Glucuronidation activity affects androgen levels
in LNCaP ADRB2 knockdown cells

UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 are correlated to
ADRB2 in two patient material data sets

A plausible effect of lowered glucuronidation
activity is shifting of the substrate/glucuronide
homeostasis and subsequent accumulation of
glucuronidable androgens, which could help explain
the observed increase in androgen responsiveness in
shADRB2 cells. We therefore measured intracellular
testosterone levels in shCtrl and shADRB2 cells cultured
in FCS medium for 48 hours (Figure 8a). An 11-fold
and 5.5-fold higher testosterone level was found in
shADRB2-1 and shADRB2-2, respectively, compared to
shCtrl. The basal reporter activity driven by the androgen
responsive probasin promoter (pPB(-285/132)-LUC)
was higher in shADRB2 cell lines compared shCtrl
cells (Figure 8b) supporting that the testosterone level is
increased in shADRB2 cell lines.
Furthermore, to establish a link between
glucuronidation activity and levels of bioavailable
androgen, we supplemented shCtrl and shADRB2-2 cells
with diclofenac sodium and measured the intracellular
testosterone levels. Diclofenac sodium caused a dosedependent induction in testosterone levels, with 17fold and 35-fold induction with 50 and 100 µM DFS,
respectively (Figure 8c). Comparably, diclofenac had
only a minor effect in shADRB2-2, which has 95% lower
androgen glucuronidation activity than shCtrl cells.

Initially, as we observed a regulation of UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 levels after ADRB2 knockdown in vitro,
we wanted to examine if these proteins were correlated
with ADRB2 expression in the Oslo ADT cohort. Both
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 predominantly showed
cytoplasmic staining of luminal cells (Supplementary
Figure 3). As can be seen in Table 2, UGT2B15 staining
was found to be positively correlated with ADRB2
staining (correlation coefficient 0.39, p-value 0.001). A
similar trend was found for UGT2B17; however this was
not statistically significant.
To verify the results in an independent study,
immunohistochemical stainings with ADRB2, UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 were performed on four TMAs, merged
into a single data set, from the Vancouver Prostate
Centre Tissue Bank. Of a total of 306 patients, 262 had
cores positive for cancer. Among these, 96 patients had
recurrent prostate cancer, 23 had diagnosed CRPC, and the
remaining 143 were patients who have undergone radical
prostatectomy. In this cohort, we observed a correlation
between ADRB2 and UGT2B15 similar to the correlation
in the Oslo ADT cohort (Table 2). Interestingly, the
correlation was stronger when only samples from patients
who have experienced recurrence or who have developed
castration resistant prostate cancer were included in the
analysis. In this dataset, the UGT2B17 staining was also
significantly correlated with ADRB2 staining (Table 2).

Figure 8: Reduced androgen glucuronidation activity affects the level of bioactive androgen in vitro. a. The basal level of

testosterone was measured in shCtrl, shADRB2-1, and shADRB2-2 LNCaP cells cultured in FCS medium. Steroids were extracted from the
cells, dried, reconstituted, and run on an LC-MS. Integrated, internal standard (IS)-normalized mean peak areas are shown related to equal
cell pellets. b. LNCaP shADRB2-1, shADRB2-2 and shCtrl cells were transfected with pPB(-285/132)-LUC. After 72 hours incubation in
FCS-medium, basal luciferase activity of the pPB(-285/132)-LUC reporter was measured and related to SEAP. The results are shown as
mean, basal luciferase activities related to shCtrl (given value 1.0) ± SD from three independent experiments. c. LNCaP shADRB2-2 and
shCtrl cells were treated with 50 or 100 µM diclofenac or vehicle for 48 hours. Integrated, internal standard (IS)-normalized peak areas
were related to total protein content and is presented as mean relative increase compared to vehicle treated cells (given value 1.0) (nM
testosterone/mg protein) from three independent experiments ± SD. Statistical significance is indicated by asterisks (*: p < 0.05, **: p <
0.01, ***: p < 0.001).

Finally, we performed a competing risk regression
analysis to see if UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, like
ADRB2, were associated with development of CRPC in
the Oslo ADT cohort. 33 and 34 out of the 45 patients
had successful immunohistochemical staining of tumor
tissue with UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, respectively. Weak
UGT2B15 staining intensity was significantly associated
with a more rapid development of CRPC (SHR 0.39,
95% CI 0.16-0.97, p-value 0.043), while UGT2B17 was
not (Table 3). Neither UGT2B15 nor UGT2B17 were
associated with prostate cancer specific or all-cause
mortality (Table 3a and 3b, respectively).

ADRB2-levels, indicating that these cells may be more
adapted to an androgen-deprived milieu. Being more
adapted to castration theoretically predicts therapy failure
or imminent recurring growth, which seems to be the case
for these shADRB2 tumors.
The increased testosterone levels and enhanced
androgen responsiveness observed in ADRB2 knockdown
cells may relate to the observation that androgenglucuronidating activity is down-regulated. Reducing
glucuronidation could preserve residual and de novo
biosynthesized androgens and thus rescue androgen
receptor stimulation, which would give the cells an
“edge” in an androgen-deprived micro milieu. Thus,
this may represent an adaption mechanism by which the
cells maintain a sufficient androgen receptor activity to
uphold survival. In vivo, this mechanism may complement
the well-known increase in intra-tumoral androgen
biosynthesis and androgen receptor expression observed
in CRPC [25-27].
The cAMP signaling pathway is an essential inducer
of steroidogenesis in steroidogenic cells [14-17]. To what
extent β-adrenergic signaling regulates steroid synthesis in
prostate cancer cells is not known, but our study suggests
that the receptor may be involved in regulating the amount
of bioactive androgen through modulating glucuronidation
activity. Testosterone levels were increased both in cells
expressing low levels of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, and
in cells treated with diclofenac, which has previously
been reported to be a UGT2B15 and UGT2B17
competitive inhibitor [28-30]. Furthermore, stimulation
with the synthetic androgen R1881, reported to be nonglucuronidable [31], gave similar androgen responses in
the shADRB2 (low UGT2B) and shCtrl (high UGT2B)
cell lines, indicating that glucuronidation regulates the
observed differences in androgen responsiveness solitarily.
In support of this, a study by Chouinard et al., showed
that knockdown of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in LNCaP
cells lead to a more pronounced modulation of androgenregulated genes [32].
Several studies have investigated the expression
level of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 in hormone naïve
and castration resistant prostate cancer [9, 25, 33].
Collectively, none of these studies show a significant
difference in immunohistochemical staining intensity for
neither UGT2B15 nor UGT2B17 expression between
androgen-dependent prostate cancer and CRPC. No
study has yet, however, investigated how UGT2B15- or
UGT2B17 expression in hormone naïve prostate cancer
relates to time to development of CRPC. In our analyses,
UGT2B15 staining intensity was statistically significantly
correlated with CRPC development, while UGT2B17 was
not. Both enzymes, however, are positively correlated
with ADRB2 staining, which itself was associated with
CRPC development. The positive correlations between the
two UGT2Bs and ADRB2 in tissue samples support our
observations of reduced UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 levels

DISCUSSION
We report that prostate cancer patients expressing
low levels of the β2-adrenergic receptor in the cancer
tissue more rapidly develop castration-resistant prostate
cancer. Furthermore, xenograft tumors from prostate
cancer cells with knockdown of ADRB2 were shown
to grow more rapidly in castrated mice than xenografts
tumors from control cells. We have identified a novel
mechanism by which ADRB2 may indirectly regulate the
activity of the androgen receptor in prostate cancer cells,
namely through regulating glucuronidation, a critical
step in the extrahepatic phase II metabolic elimination
pathway of androgens. LNCaP cells expressing low
ADRB2 levels showed reduced UGT2B15 and UGT2B17
expression and activity compared to cells expressing high
ADRB2 levels. The low ADRB2 expressing LNCaP cells
were more responsive to androgen stimuli, displayed
increased testosterone levels and a higher basal androgen
receptor activity. Furthermore, supplementation with
the competitive UGT2B-substrate diclofenac enhanced
androgen responsiveness in high-ADRB2 expressing
LNCaP cells, with a simultaneous increase in the intracellular testosterone level.
Like androgens, adrenergic stimulation contributes
to prostatic differentiation in vivo [23]. Moreover, ADRB2
signaling activates androgen responsive promoters in vitro
and is therefore suggested to play a role in development
of CRPC [12]. Short-term activation of ADRB2
stimulates androgen receptor activity [12], while longterm activation of ADRB2 leads to desensitization of
ADRB2 [24]. Furthermore, down-regulation of ADRB2
induces de-differentiation and epithelial to mesenchymal
transition (EMT) [20], a process associated with CRPC
development. This is the first study addressing whether
ADRB2 correlates with CRPC in vivo, and the data are
consistent with the hypothesis that ADRB2 is associated
with CRPC.
This study points to a novel mechanism by which
long-term knockdown of ADRB2 may support CRPC
development. In xenografts, LNCaP tumors expressing
low levels of ADRB2 have a shorter lag period and grow
more rapidly after castration than tumors with normal

after knockdown of ADRB2 in LNCaP cells. Furthermore,
the finding that differences in glucuronidation activity
between shCtrl and shADRB2 cells were maintained in
our mouse model after castration, points to the possibility
that ADRB2 may influence glucuronidation activity also
in humans.
If UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 are important
determinants of the availability of bioactive androgens
in the tumor micro milieu in vivo, patients with low
ADRB2 expression may have a lower response to
androgen-deprivation therapy through lowered UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 protein levels. This might explain our
observation that low ADRB2 levels are associated with a
poor prognosis.
It should be noted that diclofenac is a non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drug, and may thus affect pathways that
directly or indirectly affect androgen receptor activity,
i.e. through affecting prostaglandin metabolites that are
known to inhibit AR [34]. Whether this in turn could affect
our reported effects on androgen responsiveness was not
assessed in this study.
Low level of ADRB2 has previously been shown
to predict a shorter time to clinical failure after radical
prostatectomy, as defined by biochemical recurrence
[20]. It is worth noting, however, that 60-70% of men
experience recurrence without emergence of clinical
symptoms, and only around 8% of patients that experience
biochemical recurrence die from prostate cancer [35].
Thus, clinical progression probably serves as a better end
point in biomarker studies. We used clinical progression as
an end point, and see that ADRB2 may act as a prognostic
biomarker for CRPC. Furthermore, alterations in androgen
glucuronidation activity are presented as one potential
mechanism by which ADRB2 may regulate development
of castration resistant prostate cancer.

1992- 2008 were identified retrospectively from medical
records. 16 patients were excluded from the analyses due
to lack of sufficient tissue or lack of consent.
Clinical information was obtained from medical
records. Retracted data included date of birth, date of
diagnosis, date of initiation of hormonal treatment or
orchiectomy, and date of progression. Date and cause of
death were obtained from Statistics Norway, per May 1st
2012.
Tissue was obtained from “The Prostate Biobank- a
resource for urological research in Norway” (No.119 The
Biobank Registry at Norwegian Institute of Public Health).
One area representing normal and two areas representing
prostate cancer tissue were marked on hematoxylin/
eosin stained sections, extracted using a 0.6 mm tissue
core, and mounted using a semi-motorized tissue arrayer
(TMABooster, Alphelys, Plaisir, France).
The treatment initiation date was set at the first
time of administration of anti-androgen, luteinizing
hormone- releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist, or date
of orchiectomy, where applicable. Where the exact date
of diagnosis, initiation of ADT or disease progression
was not noted in the patient’s journal, the actuar-method
was used to assign an event date; that is, the middle date
between two known dates before and after diagnosis, start
of hormonal treatment, or disease progression.
Patients were considered to have CRPC in the case
of two consecutive PSA rises, progression to metastatic
disease, or when noted explicitly in the patients journal.
Briefly, for the TMA constructed from specimens
obtained from the “Vancouver Prostate Centre Tissue
Bank” [36], H&E-stained slides were inspected and
desired areas of 1 mm were extracted and mounted
manually (Beecher Instruments, MD, USA) as duplicated
cores. Among the 304 prostate cancer specimens, 143
were from radical prostatectomies, 96 were from radically
operated patients who had been pretreated with androgen
deprivation therapy for one to twelve months prior to
surgery, and the remaining 23 were CRPC samples
obtained through TUR-P. The patients were operated in
the period 1999-2009.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics
The Regional Ethical Committee (s-04153c), the
Data Protection Official at Oslo University Hospital (412009 AUS) and The Norwegian Data Protection Authority
(09/00450-2 /bso) has approved this study. Written consent
was obtained from all surviving patients, and a permission
to include clinical information on deceased patients was
obtained from the Regional Committee for Medical and
Health Research Ethics (2009/1028).

Immunohistochemistry
For the Oslo ADT TMA, TMA sections of 4 μm
were deparaffinized and antigens were retrieved at
97°C for 20 minutes using the PT-link (Dako, Glostrup,
Denmark) and “Target Retrieval Solution, high pH”
(K8004, Dako) for ADRB2 whereas the slide was
microwaved for 10 min in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA) and immersed in 0.5%
v/v hydrogen peroxide/methanol for 20 min for UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 immunostaining. The anti-ADRB2
antibody (MC2656, MBL International, Woburn, MA),
the anti-UGT2B15 antibody [37], and the anti-UGT2B17
antibody [38] were used in dilution 1:400, 1:500 and

1:500, respectively. The immunostainings were visualized
using the Envision Flex” (K8010, Dako) kit. Images
were captured using a Zeiss AXI0 Imager.A1 microscope
with an attached Zeiss AxioCamERc5s camera (Zeiss,
Oberkochen, Germany) using Histolab 8 (Alphelys,
Plaisir, France), and manual scoring of the staining was
performed by pathologists AS and WW (ADRB2) or AS
and BK (UGT2B15 and UGT2B17). For survival analyses,
staining intensity for the spot(s) with the highest apparent
Gleason score was chosen for further analysis. Where the
tissue in a spot showed more than one staining intensity,
fractions were used. In the case of two spots with the same
apparent Gleason score from one patient, or disagreement
regarding staining intensity, the average intensity was
calculated and used in the analyses. The Gleason scores
were determined by two experienced uro-pathologists (AS
and WW).
ADRB2 antibody specificity and sensitivity was
tested, and is shown in Supplementary Material and
Methods.
The immunohistochemical staining of TMAs in the
“Vancouver Prostate Centre Tissue Bank” was performed
as previously described [36]. Pathologist LF evaluated
staining intensities, and the staining intensities in the
dataset were exclusively used for correlation analyses.
For the immunohistochemical analyses of xenograft
tumors, the paraffin-embedded tumors were in brief
sectioned, mounted onto glass slides, and stained with
UGT2B15 (1:500) or UGT2B17 (1:500) antibodies.
Pathologist BK scored staining intensities.

10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) ((Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO), 100units/ml penicillin and 50mg/
ml streptomycin (InVitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37oC
with 5% CO2 and humidified air, and were given fresh
medium every 48 hours. Stable ADRB2 knockdown
was achieved by transfection of LNCaP cells at passage
25 with three different shRNA sequences (two different
ADRB2 shRNAs; shADRB2-1 and 2, and a non-targeting
shRNA; shCtrl), using Dharmafect Duo (Dharmacon/
GE). Stably transfected cells were maintained in 200μg/
ml G418 sulphate. Cells were exclusively used between
passage 28 and 45. Cell IDs of parental LNCaP, LNCaP
shADRB2 and shCtrl cell lines were verified using the
STR PowerPlex16 System (Promega, Fitchburg, WI)
(tested 07/2014).

Stimulation of cell cultures
To study effects of androgen stimulation, LNCaP
cells were grown in phenol red free RMPI 1640 (Life
technologies, Carlsbad, CA) added 2% charcoal-stripped
FBS (CSS, Gibco, Carlsbad, CA) and supplemented
with either 1.0 or 10 nM metribolone (R1881, Roussel
UCLAF), 1.0 or 10nM dihydrotestosterone (DHT, kindly
provided by the Hormone Laboratory, Oslo University
Hospital), 50 µM diclofenac sodium (DFS, Cayman
Chemical Company, MI) or vehicle (ethanol). The cells
were preincubated in RPMI with 2% CSS where noted.

Animal experiments

Plasmids

Twenty-one in-house bred, 4 week old male
NOD-SCID gamma/null mice weighing 28.2 ± 4 g were
administered 0.03mg/ml testosterone (Sigma-Aldrich)
in drinking water one week prior to s.c. injection into
the hind flank with 2 x 106 LNCaP shADRB2-2 (n
= 10) or shCtrl (n = 11) cells suspended in Matrigel
(1:1) (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Tumor volumes
were assessed weekly using caliper measurements and
calculated by the formula: (length x width2)/2. Once
tumor size reached 500mm3, the mice were surgically
castrated under anesthesia by removal of testes and taken
off testosterone supplementation. The mice were sacrificed
when the tumor volumes reached 2000 mm3. The tumors
were excised and split in two parts: One part was fresh
frozen and used for measurement of glucuronidation
activities, the other formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded
for immunohistochemical analyses. The experiment was
approved by the National Animal Research Authority
(FOTS ref. 7132) and was performed according to
regulations of the Federation of European Laboratory
Animals Science Association.

Two short hairpin SureSilencingTM shRNA plasmids
with insert sequences targeting ADRB2 mRNA, as well
as a non-targeting shRNA as control, were purchased
from Qiagen (Supplementary Table 1) (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). Two androgen-responsive reporter constructs
were used including the probasin and PSA promoters,
respectively. The PSA reporter plasmid (pGL3/PSA)
included 7 kb of the 5’- upstream region of PSA [39]. The
probasin promoter sequence (pPB(-285/132)-LUC [40])
was cloned into a Gluc-ONTM Promoter clone system
(pEZX-PG04, GeneCopoeia) expressing Luc and Secreted
alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as tracking gene (pEZXPG04-Pb-LUC). An empty pEZX-PG04 vector expressing
SEAP was used to control for differences in transfection
efficiency. A pCDNA3.1 vector, expressing the ADRB2
gene (pCDNA3.1-ADRB2), was used for over-expression
[41].

Transient transfection and reporter assays

Radioligand binding and adenylyl cyclase assays

The LNCaP sub-cell lines were transfected using
the Dharmafect Duo reagent. Reporter activities (secreted
luciferase and SEAP) in medium samples were measured
48 hours after transfection using the Secret-Pair Dual
Luminescence Assay kit (GeneCopoeia) on a Victor
Wallac Spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA). To determine intra-cellular luciferase activity cells,
cells were lysed in 1X Reporter Lysis buffer (Promega),
the supernatant mixed with Luciferase Assay Reagent
(Promega) and the activity measured on a TD-20/20
luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA).

Cell membrane fractions were prepared as described
in [44], and the ADRB2 protein binding activity was
measured by radioligand binding assay, as previously
described [45] with a binding buffer described in [46].
The total number of specific binding sites was determined.
Ligand binding was normalized to the total amount of
protein in the membrane fractions.
Adenylyl cyclase activity was measured by
determining conversion of [α-32P]ATP to [32P]cAMP in
cell membrane fractions in the presence and absence of
10 µM isoproterenol (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 minutes,
and was related to whole membrane protein as previously
described [44].

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR

Formation of steroid glucuronides

Total RNA was extracted using the TRIzol reagent
following manufacturers protocol (Invitrogen). 100 ng of
total RNA was used in the qScript™ One-Step qRT-PCR
Kit (Quanta Biosciences, Gaithersburg, MD). The RT-PCR
reactions were performed on a CFX Connect™ Real-Time
System (BioRad, Hercules, CA) under 48° C for 10 min;
95°C for 5 min for the first cycle; 95°C for 15 s, 55°C for
30 s for 40 cycles; 60 melt curve read offs from 65-95°C.
ALAS-1 or POLR-2A mRNA expression were used for
reference. To display relative gene expression, the ΔΔCt
formula [42] was used. The primers used were: ADRB2

LNCaP shADRB2 and shCtrl protein lysates were
prepared by centrifugation at 890g for 10 min at 4°C
followed by lysis by sonication on ice. The lysates were
diluted in PBS supplied with 0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)
(GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). Xenograft
homogenates were prepared by homogenizing 50 µg of
tumor tissues from mice injected with LNCaP shADRB2
and shCtrl in 250 µL of ice-cold PBS supplied with 0.5
mM DTT using a Homogenizer Motor Drives (Glass-Col
Homogenizer #099C-K54, Terre-Haute, IN, USA). Steroid
glucuronidation assays were performed by adding 10 µL
of lysates (8.8 µg/µL) or xenograft homogenates (5 µg/
µL) to a glucuronidation assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl
pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 10μg/mL phosphatidylcholine,
1 mM uridine 5’-diphosphoglucuronic acid (UDPGA),
2.5 μg/mL pepstatin, 0.5 μg/mL leupeptin, 0.025 μg/mL
alamethicin, and 100 μM of either testosterone, DHT,
3α-Diol, or androsterone dissolved in ethanol). The
mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 1 or 4 hours (cell
lysates or xenograft homogenates, respectively) before
quenching the glucuronidation reactions with 2 nM icecold methanol:butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Proteins
were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4°C to
pellet the protein precipitate. Supernatants were used for
glucuronide quantification by LC-MS/MS as previously
reported [47]. Cell lysate samples used for glucuronidation
assays were prepared with the same dilutions of those used
for immunoblotting assays, so the protein levels directly
correspond to the glucuronidation activity. HEK293-cells
and ethanol were used as negative controls, and a pool of
human liver samples as positive control.

Prostate specific antigen (PSA/KLK3)
Total PSA in medium was determined by the
AutoDELFIA ProStatus PSA Free/Total Kit (PerkinElmer
Inc., USA) by time-resolved fluorescence on the
AutoDELFIA instrument. Total PSA was normalized to
the amount of protein in each sample.

Protein extraction and immunoblot analysis
The cells were harvested, lysed in whole cell buffer
[43], and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min. Immunoblots were prepared and visualized as previously reported
[37, 38]. Anti-UGT2B15 (1:1500) or anti-UGT2B17
(1:2000) was used as primary antibodies, and anti-actin
(1:2000, #A5060, Sigma-Aldrich) as loading control. Both
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 antibodies were kindly provided
by A. Bélanger (CHU-Québec research centre) [38].

with the following modifications: Isotope-labeled internal
standards (10 µl) and 190 µl 50 % acetonitrile was added
to 85 µl of each calibrator and quality control as well as to
each cell pellet lysate. The samples were sonicated (40%
amplitude, 10 pulses of 1s), equilibrated at RT for one
hour, and extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with 850
µl ethylacetate:hexane (80:20). After centrifugation, 650
µl of the organic phase was dried under a stream of N2
for 30 minutes at 40°C. The samples were reconstituted
in 50 µl 25% methanol, and 10 µl of each sample was
injected into a Waters Xevo TQ-S that was coupled to
an i-class Acquity UPLC. The chromatographic system
consisted of a 100 x 2.1 mm Acquity BEH C-18 column
(1.8 µM particle size) heated to 60° C, and two mobile
phases consisting of Milli-Q purified water with 0.05%
ammonium hydroxide (A) and methanol with 0.05%
ammonium hydroxide (B). Samples were separated by
a linear gradient from 30% to 75% mobile phase B over
7.5 min at a flow-rate of 0.4 ml/min. Testosterone was
quantitated by electrospray ionisation in positive mode,
and multiple reaction monitoring as described previously
[48]. Concentrations were calculated as fmol per cell
pellet or tumor tissue weight.

Statistics
Time to development of CRPC and time to prostate
cancer-specific mortality was analyzed by competing risk
regression using the Fine and Grey model [49], while Cox
proportional hazards modelling was applied for all-cause
mortality analysis. The proportional hazards assumption
was assessed by a test based on Schoenfeld residuals.
There was no evidence of violation of the assumption
in any model (all p-values > 0.13). Correlations were
calculated using Spearman’s rank correlation, due to nonnormality of the data. For all other statistical analyses, a
two-tailed Student’s t-test or Fischer exact test were used
to determine statistical significance. For xenograft tumor
glucuronide formation, values were log10-transformed
to invoke normally distributed data prior to parametric
testing. Statistics were performed using SPSS version
18, STATA version 12 and Microsoft Excel. A two-sided
p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant
for all analyses.
