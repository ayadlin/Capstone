Abstract

Author Manuscript

Acquired therapeutic resistance is the major drawback to effective systemic therapies for cancers.
Aggressive triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) develop resistance to chemotherapies rapidly,
whereas the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. Here we show that genotoxic
treatments significantly increased the expression of miR-181a in TNBC cells, which enhanced
TNBC cell survival and metastasis upon Doxorubicin treatment. Consistently, high miR-181a level
associated with poor disease free survival and overall survival after treatments in breast cancer
patients. The up-regulation of miR-181a was orchestrated by transcription factor STAT3 whose
activation depended on NF-κB-mediated IL-6 induction in TNBC cells upon genotoxic treatment.
Intriguingly, activated STAT3 not only directly bound to MIR181A1 promoter to drive
transcription, it also facilitated the recruitment of MSK1 to the same region where MSK1
promoted a local active chromatin state by phosphorylating histone H3. We further identified BAX
as a direct functional target of miR-181a, whose suppression decreased apoptosis and increased
invasion of TNBC cells upon Dox treatment. These results were further confirmed by evidence
that suppression of miR-181a significantly enhanced therapeutic response and reduced lung
metastasis in a TNBC orthotopic model. Collectively, our data suggested that miR-181a induction
played a critical role in promoting therapeutic resistance and aggressive behavior of TNBC cells

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

As triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC) lack molecular targets, chemotherapy is the only
1
currently available systemic treatment for TNBC, and prognosis remains poor . Although
patients with TNBC initially are sensitive to chemotherapy, they rapidly develop resistance
to the treatment, which leads to a high incidence of early relapse. Moreover, TNBC is
characterized by aggressive metastases, which may further contribute to the rapidly arising
2
therapeutic resistance . Therefore, understanding the pathogenesis of therapeutic resistance
and metastasis of TNBC is of great importance to develop novel targeted strategies to
improve the prognosis in TNBC patients. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms
underlying therapeutic resistance and their association with metastasis are still ill-defined.

Author Manuscript

Previous studies demonstrated that chemotherapeutic drugs and radiation used for cancer
treatment effectively activate the transcription factor NF-κB, which is a key modulator of
3
inflammation, immune response and cell survival . The pro-survival function of NF-κB has
been linked with therapeutic resistance in a variety of cancers, which is associated with up4
regulation of anti-apoptotic genes driven by NF-κB . In addition, NF-κB also regulates
5
expression of noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs . MicroRNAs negatively regulate
target gene expression at the post-transcriptional level by recognizing specific sequence
primarily within the 3′- UTR (untranslated region) and, to a lesser extent, in coding
6
sequence of mRNA . Most miRNA genes are transcribed into primary-miRNAs by RNA
polymerase II, which can be sequentially processed into mature miRNAs. The transcription
of miRNA can be regulated by upstream genetic regulatory elements, such as conserved
7
transcription factor binding sites, as well as by epigenetic modifications . The expression of
miRNAs is frequently dysregulated in human malignancies, and miRNAs can function as
either oncogenes or tumor suppressors depending on the genes they target in specific
8 9
cancers , . Moreover, alteration of miRNA expression in varying cancers has been shown
to promote therapeutic resistance to both conventional chemotherapy and targeted
10
therapies . Therefore, targeting miRNA may serve as a promising strategy in combination
10 11
with targeted therapy or chemotherapy to improve anticancer efficacy , .

pro-survival function mediated by chemodrug-induced miRNAs in cancer therapeutic
response remain to be further elucidated.

Author Manuscript

In this study, we identified miR-181a as a major upregulated miRNA in TNBC cells in
response to chemotherapeutic drugs. The induction of miR-181a correlated with enhanced
cancer cell survival and aggressiveness in response to doxorubicin (Dox) treatment.
Consistently, MIR181A1 amplification was found in approximately 12% of breast cancer
samples in TCGA database. In addition, high miR-181a level significantly associated with
poor distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) in breast cancer patients. We further showed
that STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3), which was activated by
genotoxic treatment in a NF-κB-dependent manner, orchestrated transcriptional activation of
miR-181a both as a transcription factor and a regulator of epigenetic modification.
Furthermore, we identified the pro-apoptotic gene BAX as a novel functional target of
miR-181a, whose repression supported increased cell survival and metastasis in TNBC cells
exposed to Dox. Accordingly, miR-181a inhibition significantly reduced TNBC cell
resistance to Dox treatment as well as mitigated lung metastasis in vivo. Overall, our data
support a critical role of miR-181a induction in promoting acquired resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents and metastasis in TNBC cells.

In an effort to identify miRNAs whose expression was altered in TNBC cells by Dox
treatment, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with Dox (2 μg/ml) or vehicle control and
quantified miRNA profile using NanoString nCounter analysis. To enrich those miRNAs
whose expression may be regulated by genotoxic NF-κB activation, we also included two
additional groups in which cells were treated with Dox in combination with inhibitor of
ATM or IKK, two essential kinases required for NF-κB activation by DNA damage
18
16 17
(supplementary Fig. S1A) . Consistent with our previous studies , , nCounter
quantification and qPCR analyses indicated that miR-21 and miR-125b were among the
most upregulated miRNAs whose induction depended on both ATM and IKK activity (Fig.
1A and Supplementary Fig. S1B). We also found miR-181a expression was significantly
increased in MDA-MB-231 cells treated by Dox, whose induction was attenuated by ATM
and IKK inhibitors. In parallel, Dox-induced miR-181a upregulation was abrogated in
MDA-MB-231 cells in which RELA/p65 was depleted by siRNA as well as in p65-deficient
MEFs, suggesting a critical role of NF-κB/p65 in regulating miR-181a induction by DNA
damage (supplementary Fig. S1C, S1D). Similar results were observed in another TNBC
cell line HCC1937 cells (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we detected significant induction of miR-181a
in MDA-MB-231 cells and HER2+ breast cancer BT474 cells upon IR, which was sensitive
to inhibition of ATM or IKK, suggesting that genotoxic agent-induced miR-181a upregulation may not limited to TNBC cells (Fig. 1C and supplementary Fig. S2C). In addition
to mature miR-181a, we also detected significant induction of primary transcripts of
MIR181A1 in MDA-MB-231 and BT474 cells in response to genotoxic treatment, which
was attenuated by inhibition of ATM or IKK (supplementary Fig. S1E, 1F). These data

suggest that genotoxic agents may induce miR-181a up-regulation at the transcriptional
level.
To determine pathological significance of miR-181a induction, we overexpressed miR-181a
in MDA-MB-231 cells and found that it significantly enhanced cells survival upon Dox
treatment compared with mock transfected cells. In contrast, antagonizing miR-181a by
miR-181a-sponge inhibitor substantially increased MDA-MB-231 cell sensitivity to Dox and
resulted in reduced cell survival upon treatment (Fig. 1D). Moreover, overexpression of
miR-181a increased, while inhibiting miR-181a reduced, MDA-MB-231 cell migration and
invasion following Dox treatment (Fig. 1E, F). These results are in line with previous studies
indicating a strong association between therapeutic resistance and aggressive metastasis in
1
TNBC , and suggesting that miR-181a induction by Dox in TNBC cells may contribute to
acquired resistance and promote metastasis.

miR-181a is amplified in breast cancer patients and associates with poor clinical outcomes

Author Manuscript

Distinct roles of miR-181a in cancer progression have been reported in different cancer
types. miR-181a was shown to promote ovarian cancer progression by promoting epithelial19
mesenchymal transition (EMT) , while ectopic miR-181a expression inhibited acute
20
myeloid leukemia tumor growth . To determine the potential function of miR-181a in
breast cancer pathogenesis, we analyzed two independent clinical patient data sets. We
collected 62 FFPE samples of TNBC patients (Supplementary Tab. S1) and analyzed
miR-181a level by qPCR. When stratified by median miR-181a level, high expression group
significantly correlated with poor DMFS among these TNBC patients (Fig. 2A). In another
21
publicly available data set (GSE19536) , we found high miR-181a level was associated
with poor DFS in breast cancer patients (Supplementary Fig S2A), although it did not reach
statistical significance likely due to small cohort numbers. Consistently, MDA-MB-231 cells
with increased miR181a level showed significantly enhanced survival upon prolonged Dox
treatment, whereas inhibiting miR-181a promoted Dox-induced cell death (Fig. 2B).
Furthermore, in patient data collected by TCGA invasive breast cancer study, we found
MIR181A1 was amplified in about 12% of breast cancer patients (Supplementary Fig. S2B).
Among those patients characterized by molecular subtypes, higher rate of MIR181A
amplification was found in HER2+ subtype compared to the other subtypes (Fig. 2C). In
accordance, miR-181a expression level was significantly higher in HER2+ and basal subtype
breast cancers, which tend to be more aggressive and associate with poor prognosis (Fig.
2D). Consistently, we detect substantially higher miR-181a levels in TNBC/basal-like breast
cancer tissues than that in luminal breast cancer and normal breast tissues (Fig. 2E).
Subtype-specific enrichment of miR-181 cluster upregulation was also confirmed in a
22
miRNA profiling analysis among 51 human breast cancer cell lines . The level of
miR-181b, a miR-181 family member co-transcribed with miR-181a in same cluster, was
significantly increased in HER2+ and basal-like breast cancer cell lines compared to luminal
and normal-like/claudin-low breast cancer cells (Fig. 2F).
The significantly increased level of miR-181a in HER2+ breast cancer cells led us to
speculate that miR-181a may also promote HER2+ breast cancer cell survival. Indeed,
inhibiting miR-181a substantially increased HER2+ BT474 cell sensitivity to

chemotherapeutic drug Dox and HER2-targeting kinase inhibitor Lapatinib, resulting in
further decreased cell survival upon treatments (Fig. 2G). All these data indicate that
miR-181a functions as an oncomiR in breast cancer development and progression. The
miR-181a-mediated therapeutic resistance may be not limited in TNBC cells upon
chemotherapy, it also plays a critical role in modulating HER2+ breast cancer cell response
to HER2-targeted therapies.
NF-κB-mediated STAT3 activation is essential for miR-181a induction by genotoxic drugs

Author Manuscript

Bioinformatic analysis of MIR181A1 promoter region revealed several binding sites of
transcription factors NF-κB and STAT3 which both can be activated by DNA damage. By
chromatin IP (ChIP), we detected a significant increase of STAT3 recruitment to the
proximal STAT3 site (S3) (Fig. 3A). However, no substantial enrichment of NF-κB/p65 was
detected on MIR181A1 promoter (supplementary Fig. S3A). Moreover, luciferase reporter
assay confirmed that deletion of STAT3 site3 almost abrogated MIR181A1 promoter-driven
transcription in response to Dox treatment, while mutation of NF-κB sites showed little
effect (supplementary Fig. S3B). These data indicate that STAT3, but not NF-κB, is a direct
transcription regulator of miR-181a induction upon genotoxic treatment.

Author Manuscript

To further confirm the critical role of STAT3 in inducing miR-181a expression in TNBC
cells, we transfected a dominant-negative STAT3 mutant (DN-STAT3 Y705F) into MDAMB-231 cells. Dox treatment induced robust up-regulation of miR-181a, which was
significantly attenuated by transfection of DN-STAT3 (Fig. 3B). Consistently, a STAT3
inhibitor WP1066 blocked STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705 and abrogated miR-181a
induction in Dox-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3C). Moreover, inhibiting STAT3
activation by WP1066 also blocked STAT3 recruitment to MIR181A promoter in MDAMB-231 cells upon Dox treatment (Fig. 3D). Taken together, this evidence supports that
DNA damage-induced STAT3 activation is essential for miR-181a induction in TNBC cells.

Author Manuscript

As our original screen showed that miR-181a induction by Dox was sensitive to inhibition of
ATM or IKK (Fig. 1A), and our ChIP analyses did not support a direct role of NF-κB in
regulating miR-181a transcription, we reasoned that genotoxic NF-κB activation may
indirectly modulate miR-181a expression by activating STAT3 in TNBC cells upon DNA
damage. In agreement with this notion, treatment with ATM or IKK inhibitor, KU55933 or
TPCA-1 respectively, substantially decreased STAT3 enrichment on MIR181A promoter in
Dox-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3E). Our previous studies showed that genotoxic
stress-induced NF-κB activation can induce up-regulation and secretion of proinflammatory
16 23
cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8 and TNFα , . Accordingly, we found Dox-induced increase
in IL-6 transcription and secretion was diminished in cells with p65 deficiency
(supplementary Fig S3D-F). Moreover, p65 deficiency also attenuated STAT3 activation
upon Dox treatment (supplementary Fig. S3C). Consistently, blocking IL-6, but not TNFα,
with neutralizing antibody in culture media remarkably reduced STAT3 recruitment to
MIR181A promoter in response to Dox (Fig. 3F). In parallel, treatment with recombinant
IL6 was able to restore the miR-181a induction by Dox attenuated by IKK inhibitor TPCA1
(supplementary Fig. S3G). All these data support a critical role of NF-κB-IL6-STAT3 axis in
up-regulating miR-181a transcription in TNBC cells upon genotoxic stimulation.

IL-6-induced Tyr705 phosphorylation is essential for STAT3 activation. Meanwhile,
phosphorylation at Ser727 was also implicated to play critical role in modulating STAT3
24
transactivity . We found STAT3 was phosphorylated at Ser727 with a slightly delayed
kinetics compared to Tyr705 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells upon Dox treatment
(Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Increased phosphorylation of STAT3 upon
genotoxic treatment was detected both in cytoplasm and nuclei of MDA-MB-231 cells.
Moreover, chromatin-bound STAT3 was phosphorylated at both Tyr705 and Ser727,
supporting the critical role of phosphorylation on both residues in mediating STAT3depedent gene transactivation (Fig. 4A). Accordingly, miR-181a induction by Dox in
25
prostate cancer PC3 cells, which is STAT3 deficient , was significantly enhanced by
reconstitution of wild type STAT3, but neither STAT3-Y705F nor -S727A mutant (Fig. 4B).

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The phosphorylation of STAT3 on Ser727 and Tyr705 by DNA damage is regulated by
distinct mechanisms, as reconstitution with STAT3-Y705F in PC3 cells did not block Ser727
phosphorylation by Dox, and vice versa (Supplementary Fig. S4B). A number of kinases,
such as mTOR, MAPK and MSK1, have been shown to phosphorylate STAT3 at Ser727,
26
depending on the stimulus and cell type . Interestingly, we previously showed that MSK1
was activated in TNBC cells by genotoxic agents and MSK1-dependent histone H3
16
phosphorylation was required for miR-21 induction upon Dox treatment . We found that
MSK1 inhibitor H-89 abolished STAT3 Ser727 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells
exposed to Dox, as well as attenuated the upregulation of miR-181a transcription by Dox
(Fig. 4C). The decrease of miR-181a induction and cell survival upon Dox treatment was
also observed in MSK1-depleted MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4D and supplementary Fig.
S4C). Moreover, genotoxic treatment enhanced interaction between MSK1 and STAT3 in
MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4E), which was independent of NF-κB or IL-6 (supplementary
Fig. S4D), suggesting a direct response to DNA damage. Consistently, blocking MSK1
activation by H-89 or MSK1 knockdown also significantly reduced STAT3 recruitment at
MIR181A1 promoter (Fig. 4F and supplementary Fig. S4E, S4F). In line with this
observation, mutation at either Tyr705 or Ser727 dramatically reduced STAT3 enrichment at
MIR181A1 promoter in PC3 cells treated by Dox (Fig. 4G). All these data suggest that
phosphorylation on both Tyr705 and Ser727 are required for MIR181A1 promoter
recruitment thereby driving miR-181a transactivation in cancer cells upon genotoxic
treatment.
Activated STAT3 recruits/stabilizes MSK1 binding to MIR181A promoter upon genotoxic
treatment

Author Manuscript

Since MSK1 can phosphorylate histone H3 at Ser10 and Ser28, which both mark an active
27
chromatin state , we reasoned that MSK1 may also have a role in regulating miR-181a
induction in TNBC cells by modifying chromatin structure. We detected a robust induction
of histone H3S28 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-231 cells in response to Dox treatment
which was abolished by H-89 or MSK1 knockdown, indicating a critical role of MSK1 in
regulating H3S28 phosphorylation upon DNA damage (Fig. 5A, 5B). Global H3K27
methylation level appeared unaffected by Dox and/or MSK1 inhibition. However, ChIP
analyses revealed that Dox treatment induced a significant decrease of H3K27 methylation
(H3K27me3) concurrent with increased H3S28 phosphorylation at the MIR181A promoter

region (Fig. 5C). This observation is consistent with previous reports showing that
phosphorylation of H3S28 leads to decreased methylation at neighboring H3K27, thereby
28 29
activating transcription of a subset of genes , .
In agreement with the local change of histone H3 modifications, we also detected a
significant increase of MSK1 binding at MIR181A promoter. Interestingly, the chromatin
region with enriched MSK1 binding overlapped with STAT3 binding site (S3) within
MIR181A promoter (supplementary Fig. S4G), suggesting MSK1 and STAT3 may form a
complex on MIR181A promoter. In accordance, ChIP-reChIP assay using sequential IP with
MSK1 and pS727-STAT3 antibodies confirmed the co-recruitment of MSK1 and activated
STAT3 to the S3 site within MIR181A promoter in Dox-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig.
5D).

Author Manuscript

To explore the interrelationship between STAT3 and MSK1 recruitment to MIR181A
promoter upon DNA damage, we analyzed MSK1 recruitment in STAT3-deficient PC3 cells
and PC3 cells reconstituted with STAT3-WT, -Y705F, or -S727A mutant. Interestingly, we
found MSK1 enrichment at MIR181A promoter depended on STAT3 (Fig. 5E). Moreover,
Y705F or S727A mutation, which blocked STAT3 binding to MIR181A promoter (Fig. 4G),
also abolished MSK1 recruitment to MIR181A promoter in Dox-treated PC3 cells (Fig. 5E).
Consistently, in PC3 cells expressing STAT3-Y705F or -S727A mutant, Dox-induced
H3S28ph was also remarkably reduced compared to that in STAT3-WT reconstituted cells
(Fig. 5F). Collectively, these results indicate that STAT3 activation by phosphorylation at
Y705 and S727 is required for genotoxic stimulation-induced MSK1 enrichment at
MIR181A promoter, where stabilized MSK1 binding further phosphorylates H3S28 and
promotes a local active chromatin state, facilitating MIR181A transactivation.

BAX is a functional direct target of miR-181a and mediates miR-181a-promoted breast
cancer cell drug resistance and aggressive invasion

Author Manuscript

To delineate the underlying mechanism of miR-181a-promoted breast cancer therapeutic
resistance and aggressive behavior, we searched potential target gene of miR-181a using
several bioinformatics tools such as TargetScan, PicTar, miRanda and Rna22. We
particularly focused on apoptosis-related Bcl-2 family genes as several members within this
group including BCL2, MCL1 and BCL2L11 have been identified as miR-181a targets in
30
different cells . Intriguingly, we found a miR-181a targeting sequence within coding
region of BAX, which is highly conserved among different species as well as eight human
isoforms (Fig. 6A and supplementary Fig. S5A). Moreover, overexpression of miR-181a
significantly down-regulated expression of a luciferase reporter fused to wild type BAX
miR-181a-targeting sequence, but not mutated sequence (Fig. 6A). Consistently, BAX
expression was substantially decreased in MDA-MB-231 cells upon Dox treatment and/or
overexpressing miR-181a. Furthermore, miR-181a sponge inhibitor was able to rescue the
decrease of BAX protein level in response to Dox treatment, (Fig. 6B). All these data
strongly suggest a critical role of miR-181a in suppressing BAX expression in breast cancer
cells upon DNA damage.
To further validate whether miR-181a-dependent suppression of BAX is mediated by
miRNA-dependent pathway, we compared the response of BAX-miR-181a reporter to Dox

treatment in wild type HCT116 cells and HCT116 cells deficient of Dicer, which is essential
31
for miRNA biogenesis . As expected, Dox treatment induced a dramatic decrease in BAXmiR-181a reporter activity in HCT116 cells, but little effect was detected in Dicer-deficient
cells (Fig. 6C). In agreement, overexpression of primary-miR-181a was able to decrease
BAX expression in HCT116 cells, but not in HCT116 Dicer-deficient cells (Fig. 6D),
supporting that Dox-induced BAX downregulation is primarily mediated by miR-181adependent post-transcriptional repression.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine the functional significance of BAX suppression in miR-181a-mediated
chemotherapeutic resistance, we transfected MDA-MB-231 cells with miR-181a alone or
along with BAX construct. Dox-induced Caspase 3/8 activation was substantially decreased
in miR-181a transfected cells, which was correlated with decreased BAX expression.
Moreover, co-transfection of BAX along with miR-181a rescued miR-181a-dependent BAX
down-regulation and reinforced Dox-induced Caspase activation in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Fig. 6E). Enhanced cell survival by miR-181a overexpression in Dox-treated MDAMB-231 cells was significantly attenuated by co-transfection of BAX (Fig. 6F). We also
found ectopic expression of BAX was able to mitigate the increased migration and invasion
in miR-181a-overexpressed MDA-MB-231 cells upon Dox treatment (supplementary Fig.
S5B, S5C). These observations were further supported by clear association between low
BAX expression and poor overall survival in a breast cancer patient dataset (GSE25065, Fig.
32
6G), which is also in agreement with the data obtained from KM Plotter showing that
high BAX expressing is associated with better RFS in ER−/PR− breast cancer patients
(supplementary Fig. S5D). Moreover, we confirmed the negative correlation between
miR-181a and BAX expression level in both TCGA breast cancer dataset and our own
TNBC patient sample collection (Fig. 6H and supplementary Fig. S5E). Altogether, these
data indicate that BAX is a critical functional target gene of miR-181a whose suppression
may contribute to acquired therapeutic resistance and increased metastasis in TNBC cells.
Inhibiting miR-181a sensitizes breast cancer to Dox treatment and mitigating lung
metastasis in vivo

Author Manuscript

Our data from in vitro cell culture model suggested that miR-181a induction upon genotoxic
treatment in TNBC cells may play important roles in mediating therapeutic resistance and
cancer metastasis. To validate the potential pathophysiological significance of miR-181a
induction in therapeutic response of breast cancer, we generated an orthotopic breast cancer
33
model using MDA-MB-231 LM2 subline which has high lung metastasis tendency . As
shown in Fig. 7A, Dox treatment remarkably reduced tumor growth compared to salinetreated group. However, the tumor-suppressive efficacy of Dox treatment substantially
decreased after the third injection of Dox (around 44 days) as the tumors resumed an
accelerated growth, suggesting potential acquired resistance to Dox treatment. In contrast,
LM2 cells stably expressing miR-181a sponge inhibitor showed extended growth
suppression in response to Dox treatment (Fig. 7A). After 4 cycles of Dox treatment,
xenograft tumors from LM2-miR-181a sponge cells showed significantly decreased size and
tumor weight compared to LM2 xenograft (Fig. 7A-C and supplementary Fig. S6A). These
data were consistent with the observation that antagonizing miR-181a with sponge inhibitor
significantly sensitized LM2 cells to Dox treatment in vitro (supplementary Fig. S6B). In

addition to reduced tumor growth, we also observed significantly reduced lung metastasis in
mice transplanted with LM2-miR181a sponge cells relative to LM2-transplanted mice (Fig.
7D, 7E). Moreover, when normalized to primary tumor weight, lung metastasis of LM2miR181a sponge cells still showed significant decrease compared to parent LM2 cells,
suggesting that the decreased lung metastasis by antagonizing miR-181a was not solely due
to reduced primary tumor growth (supplementary Fig. S6C). Altogether, these data strongly
support an important role of miR-181a induction in response to Dox treatment in promoting
therapeutic resistance and remote metastasis of TNBC cells in vivo.

Author Manuscript

To validate the negative correlation between miR-181a and BAX expression in breast
cancers and the potential role of BAX in mediating TNBC cells response to
chemotherapeutic drugs, we determined the miR-181a level in xenograft tumors with qPCR
and BAX expression with immunohistochemistry. In agreement with the BAX-suppressive
effect of miR-181a observed in cultured LM2 cells (supplementary Fig. S6D), we found
Dox treatment significantly increased miR-181a level in LM2 xenograft tumors, which
negatively correlated to BAX expression (Fig. 7F and supplementary Fig. S6E). Moreover,
BAX expression was recovered by expression of miR-181a sponge inhibitor in LM2 cells. In
line with these results, we found Dox-induced apoptosis was further enhanced in breast
cancer cells expressing miR-181a sponge, which is associated with increased BAX
expression in LM2 xenograft tumors (Fig. 7G, 7H). Collectively, these data suggest that
BAX is a critical mediator of Dox-induced breast cancer cell apoptosis, whose
downregulation by miR-181a may lead to tumor resistance to Dox treatment.

DISCUSSION

The potential significance of miRNAs in cancer therapeutic response and spontaneous/
acquired resistance has been highlighted by recent progress in mechanistic studies as well as

development of miRNA-based therapeutic approaches . Here we showed that induction of
miR-181a played a critical role in mediating acquired resistance to chemotherapeutic drug
Doxorubicin in TNBC cells. Moreover, the Dox-resistance also closely correlated with
increased metastasis of TNBC cells, and inhibiting miR-181a sensitized TNBC cells to Dox
treatment and reduced metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Intriguingly, our mechanistic
exploration revealed a pivotal role of transcription factor STAT3 in orchestrating miR-181a
induction upon Dox treatment. Recruitment of STAT3 on MIR181A promoter in response to
genotoxic treatment not only activated transcriptional machinery, it may also facilitate
and/or stabilize binding of MSK1 on MIR181A promoter. The MIR181A promoter-bound
MSK1 phosphorylated histone H3S28 and led to local depletion of transcription-suppressive
28
marker H3K27me3, likely by displacing polycomb group protein complex in this region .
The increased H3S28 phosphorylation and decreased H3K27 methylation may alter the
chromatin conformation and facilitate STAT3-driven transactivation of miR-181a in breast
cancer cells upon DNA damage (Fig. 7I).
Accumulating evidence suggests that binding of transcription factor may change the local
chromatin state. It was reported that promoter-bound STAT3 facilitated histone methyl
transferase SET9 recruitment to SOCS3 promoter region where it promoted transcription by
34
methylating histone H3 on Lys4 (H3K4me) . Moreover, augmented STAT3 and STAT5

recruitment to the IL10 promoter and enhancer increased histone H3K18 acetylation by
35
recruiting p300, which facilitated IL10 transactivation in T cells . In parallel, two recent
studies showed that NF-κB could facilitate an active chromatin state by recruiting chromatin
36 37
remodeling complex SWI/SNF to specific gene promoters , . In this study, we found
MSK1 is required for STAT3 phosphorylation at Ser727 upon DNA damage and blocking
STAT3-S727 phosphorylation diminished STAT3 enrichment on MIR181A promoter region.
Our previous study indicated MSK1 was activated by genotoxic treatments in breast cancer
16
cells in a manner dependent on ATM and MAPK14 . Moreover, we detected
phosphorylated STAT3 (pS727) in cytoplasmic fraction of MDA-MB-231 cells after Dox
treatment. Therefore, following IL6R/JAK-dependent STAT3-Y705 phosphorylation, DNA
damage-activated MSK1 may enhance STAT3 activation by phosphorylating STAT3-S727,
which in turn translocated into the nucleus and bound to specific gene promoters such as
MIR181A promoter. Promoter-bound STAT3 further induced epigenetic activation of
MIR181A by enhancing MSK1 binding to the promoter and facilitating histone H3S28
phosphorylation. Interestingly, a recent genome-wide analysis revealed that H3S28ph
marked around 50% of stress-induced genes, which was mostly enriched at promoters and
38
5’-UTRs . These finding suggest that STAT3-mediated H3S28ph may play a much broader
role in regulating gene transcription in cells exposed to genotoxic stress, which warrants
further investigation.

Distinct roles of miR-181a have been reported in regulating chemotherapeutic resistance
depending on cancer types and drugs investigated. Induction of miR-181a upon cisplatin
39
treatment was shown to enhance apoptosis in non-small cell lung cancer A549 cells . In
breast cancer MCF7 cells, miR-181a was proposed to enhance therapeutic efficacy in
mitoxantone-resistant cells by repressing breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/
40
ABCG2) . In contrast, miR-181a promoted chemoresistance to cisplatin in both cervical
cancer cells and tongue squamous carcinoma cells, and PRKCD and Twist1, respectively,
41 42
were identified as miR-181a targets responsible for cisplatin resistance , . In a recent
study aiming to identify miRNAs correlating with resistance to anthracyclines or taxanesbased adjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC patients, both miR-181a and miR-181b were found
43
to be upregulated in TNBC tumors and associated with chemoresistance . In agreement
with these findings, we found miR-181a induction in TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells repressed
apoptosis in response to Dox treatment, suggesting a resistance-promoting effect. The proapoptotic gene BAX was identified as a functional direct target of miR-181a in MDAMB-231 cells whose downregulation may lead to increased resistance to Dox in TNBC cells.
BAX and BAK are the effectors of Bcl-2 family to induce mitochondrial outer membrane
permeabilization (MOMP) and subsequent cytochrome C release, which depends on their
translocation and oligomerization on outer mitochondrial membrane upon stress stimulation.
A recent study showed that inhibiting effectors, BAX/BAK per se, is more effective to
44
suppress MOMP-induced apoptosis . These findings agree with our results that miR-181adependent suppression of BAX effectively reduced, whereas stabilizing BAX with
miR-181a-sponge inhibitor enhanced, apoptosis in Dox-treated breast cancer cells. Although
BAX suppression appeared to play a major role in mediating Dox-resistance, we cannot
exclude that other miR-181a targets may also contribute to the acquired resistance to Dox in
TNBC cells. For instance, BCL2L11 has been identified as a miR-181a target gene in mouse

breast cancer cells treated with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, whose downregulation
45
promoted metastasis by inhibiting anoikis . Moreover, TGF-β-induced miR-181a was
shown to suppress DNA damage apical kinase ATM in breast cancer cells thereby promoting
46
the increase of breast cancer stem-like cell population , which has been linked with higher
chemotherapeutic resistance.

Author Manuscript

Besides inhibiting pro-apoptotic genes such as BCL2L11 and BAX, miR-181a may also
promote cancer metastasis by enhancing cancer cell motility and altering cancer
microenvironment. In colorectal tumors from patients with liver metastases, miR-181a was
47
found to be the most elevated miRNA compared to those patients without metastases .
WIF1 was identified as a direct target gene of miR-181a which promoted colorectal cancer
cell motility and invasion. Moreover, miR-181a was enriched in recurrent ovarian tumors
compared to the matched-primary tumors, which may promote EMT by repressing its
19
functional target Smad7 . In addition, the effect of upregulated miR-181a may not be
limited to cancer cells themselves, as miR-181a can be secreted into tumor
microenvironment and blood/lymphatic circulation which may facilitate breast cancer cell
local invasion as well as metastasis to remote sites. Accordingly, a recent study showed that
miR-181a is one of predominant miRNAs present in exosomes isolated from serum from
48
stage II and III breast cancer patients . Therefore, genotoxic therapy-induced upregulation
of miR-181a may have profound impact on breast cancer migration and invasion via both
autonomous and non-autonomous mechanisms, resulting in aggressive metastasis.

Author Manuscript

Our studies indicate that miR-181a upregulation in response to genotoxic treatment in breast
cancer cells may serve as an important mechanism promoting acquired therapeutic
resistance and aggressive metastasis. The findings that HER2+ breast cancer patients have a
higher rate of miR-181a amplification and inhibiting miR-181a also sensitized breast cancer
cells to HER2-targeted therapy imply that blocking miR-181a may not only improve the
TNBC response to genotoxic chemotherapy, it may also enhance the efficacy of targeted
therapy in HER2+ breast cancer patients. Therefore, developing miR-181a-targeting
therapeutic approaches may hold high promise to sensitize breast cancers to both
conventional chemotherapy and targeted therapy by simultaneously affecting multiple
cellular processes involved in therapeutic resistance and metastasis.

Patient cohort

Author Manuscript

A series of clinical data from 62 TNBC patients was collected at FUSCC (Supplemental
Table 1). Tumors with immunohistochemical (IHC) phenotypes of ER-, PR- and HER2were included. The protocol was reviewed and approved by an independent institutional
review board at Fudan University, and all patients gave their written informed consent before
inclusion in this study. All eligible patients proceeded to surgery between January 1, 2009
and December 31, 2010. Post-operative chemotherapy and radiation therapy were suggested
according to breast cancer guidelines of FUSCC. Follow-up for these patients was
completed on Jun 30, 2014. Tumor tissue was obtained from patients undergoing surgery
and immediately stored at −80°C.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

Author Manuscript

ChIP assays were carried out as previously described . In brief, cells were cross-linked
with 1% formaldehyde, sonicated and then immunoprecipitated with antibodies against
STAT3, MSK1, H3, H3K27me3, H3S28ph, or pS727-STAT3 suspended in dilution buffer
(1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1). The ChIP-PCR
primers were designed to amplify the promoter regions containing respective binding sites in
the miR-181a promoter. For ChIP-reChIP experiments, reChIP buffer (Dilution Buffer,
10mM DTT) was added to beads after 1st IP following washes and incubated at 37°C for 50
minutes. The sample was then diluted 40 times in dilution buffer, and subjected to 2nd IP.
Animal Studies

Female NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice (age 6 wk) were maintained in the UTHSC animal
facility. All animal studies were conducted in accordance with NIH animal use guidelines
and a protocol approved by UTHSC IACUC. Power analysis was performed with G*Power
online analysis freeware, using repeated-measures ANOVA with between-subjects factors. 1
× 106 MDA-MB-231 LM2 parental or sponge-miR181a stable cells were injected into mice
mammary fat pad (2/each mice). 10 mice injected with each cell line were randomly divided
into 2 groups (5/group) with total of 4 groups. Group assignment and tumor monitoring were
carried out double-blinded. Tumor volume was assessed by caliper measurement using the
formula (width2× length/2) (mm3) and mice were imaged by Xenogen IVIS system (Caliper
Life Sciences; Alameda, CA). When palpable tumors reached ~100 mm3, the mice were
treated with intraperitoneal injection of Doxorubicin (2mg/kg) or Saline once a week. After
four cycles, the mice were sacrificed and primary tumors were isolated for further
experiments. The right lobes of the lungs were digested to prepare DNA using QIAamp
genomic DNA kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instruction. Purified DNA was
subjected to qPCR analysis using primers specific for the human Alu sequences, as
49
described previously .
Statistical Analysis
The results were presented as Mean ± SD, and analyzed with one-way ANOVA and
Student's t-test. Disease free survival analysis was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method.
The Spearman rank test was used for correlation analysis. All statistical analyses were
