Abstract

Author Manuscript

Secretory clusterin (sCLU) is a stress-induced, pro-survival glycoprotein elevated in early-stage
cancers, in particular in APC/Min-defective colon cancers. sCLU is upregulated after exposure to
various cytotoxic agents, including ionizing radiation (IR), leading to a survival advantage. We
found that stimulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)R–mitogen-activated protein kinase
signaling was required for sCLU induction after IR exposure. Here, we show that activation of
Ataxia telangiectasia-mutated kinase (ATM) by endogenous or exogenous forms of DNA damage
was required to relieve basal repression of IGF-1 transcription by the p53/NF-YA complex,
leading to sCLU expression. In contrast, ATM-deficient cells were unable to induce IGF-1 and
sCLU after DNA damage. Although p53 levels were stabilized and elevated after DNA damage,
dissociation of NF-YA and thereby p53 from the IGF-1 promoter resulted in IGF-1 induction,
indicating that NF-YA was rate limiting. Cells with elevated endogenous DNA damage (deficient
in H2AX, MDC1, NBS1, mTR or hMLH1) or cells exposed to DNA-damaging agents had
elevated IGF-1 expression, resulting in activation of IGF-1R signaling and sCLU induction. In
contrast, ATM-deficient cells were unable to induce sCLU after DNA damage. Our results
integrate DNA damage from genetic instability and in response to IR or chemotherapeutic agents,
to ATM activation and abrogation of p53/NF-YA-mediated IGF-1 transcriptional repression,
leading to IGF-1–sCLU expression. Elucidation of this pathway is important to uncover new
mechanisms for cancer progression and reveal new targets for drug development to overcome
resistance to therapy.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Before neoplastic transformation, initiated normal cells undergo a re-programming of
inherent gene expression, permitting subsequent cancer promotion and progression. These
changes typically result in upregulation of proteins that provide pro-survival signals and
down-regulation of cell-death initiation events. One pro-survival pathway commonly and
constitutively upregulated in human tumors is the insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)/
IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R) tyrosine kinase signaling cascade (Ryan and Goss, 2008). We
found that exposure of cells to IGF-1 induced secretory clusterin (sCLU) expression, and
that IGF-1R signaling was essential for sCLU upregulation after ionizing radiation (IR)
exposure. In addition to IR, sCLU is induced after exposure to chemotherapeutic agents and
ultraviolet (UV) radiation (Boothman et al., 1993; Miyake et al., 2000); however, the role of
IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling in sCLU induction after these agents was not investigated.
Although we noted that wild-type p53 repressed basal sCLU expression and partially
inhibited sCLU upregulation after IR exposure (Criswell et al., 2003), a link between
IGF-1R signaling and p53 suppression was not elucidated. The initiating signals from DNA
damage to upregulation of IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling remain undefined.

sCLU is a heavily glycosylated, 80 kDa secreted protein that functions in both an extra- and
intracellular manner to promote cell survival. sCLU is synthesized as a 60-kDa precursor
protein (psCLU) that is targeted to the ER. Within the ER, psCLU is cleaved approximately
into half, linked together by five disulfide bonds, and is heavily glycosylated to form mature
sCLU (80 kDa). sCLU production appears as two major protein forms by western blotting.
The band at ~60 kDa corresponds to psCLU and represents the protein before maturation.
The ~40-kDa smear corresponds to one half of the mature sCLU at varying states of
glycosylation (Jones and Jomary, 2002). Expression changes in psCLU and sCLU are
always concordant, and both forms consistently match CLU promoter activity (Criswell et
al., 2003), allowing any one of these proteins to be monitored for changes in sCLU
expression.

Author Manuscript

Outside the cell, sCLU acts as a molecular chaperone, binding to stress-induced unfolded
proteins, lipids and amyloid, among other molecules, and works to clear cell debris after
tissue trauma (de Silva et al., 1990; Boggs et al., 1996; Wilson and Easterbrook-Smith,
2000). Within the cell, sCLU can bind Bax and prevent its translocation to the mitochondria,
thereby blocking apoptosis (Zhang et al., 2005). Owing to these pro-survival functions,
sCLU overexpression is responsible for increased resistance of cancer cells to various
stresses, including doxorubicin, cisplatin and taxol (Miyake et al., 2000). Depletion of sCLU
by antisense or small interfering RNA causes hypersensitization of cancer cells to paclitaxel
and IR (Criswell et al., 2005; So et al., 2005). Aside from exogenous stress, sCLU is
constitutively elevated in many early-stage cancers, during replicative senescence, and in
Alzheimer’s disease (Chen et al., 2003). These observations strongly suggest that elevated
sCLU levels in cancer, as well as induction of sCLU after cytotoxic agent exposures, may
result in the consequent resistance of cancer cells to therapy, including cancer stem cells.
Therefore, antisense constructs specific for sCLU (that is, OGX-011) were developed and
are now in phase II/III clinical trials in combination with standard chemotherapies for
prostate cancer (Chi et al., 2010). Thus, understanding sCLU regulation after DNA damage

and in genetically unstable cells should lead to a better understanding of resistance to
therapy and open avenues for improving cancer therapy.

Author Manuscript

Here, we show that p53 and NF-YA are necessary to suppress basal IGF-1 transcription by
binding together at a single NF-Y consensus site within the IGF-1 promoter. Although p53
levels were stabilized and elevated after IR exposure, loss of p53/NF-YA binding from the
IGF-1 promoter after IR exposure allows for IGF-1 induction to, in turn, activate IGF-1R
signaling and sCLU induction. Interestingly, we noted that genetically unstable cells have
heightened basal IGF-1 and sCLU levels and concomitant elevated Ataxia telangiectasiamutated kinase (ATM) signaling, not unlike cells undergoing a DNA damage response. We
found that ATM was the DNA damage sensor kinase responsible for IGF-1–sCLU
upregulation after endogenous or exogenous DNA damage. Collectively, our findings show
that the ATM–IGF-1–sCLU expression axis is an important pro-survival pathway activated
in response DNA damage, which has important implications in carcinogenesis, tumor
progression and resistance in cancer therapies.

Results
p53 negatively regulates basal IGF-1 expression

Author Manuscript

p53 has an important and essential role in responding to cell stress by either activating or
repressing gene expression, controlling checkpoint responses, and inducing apoptosis. Data
from our laboratory suggested that p53 suppressed basal sCLU expression; however, sCLU
was moderately induced after IR exposure, even though p53 was stabilized (Criswell et al.,
2003). The mechanism of p53-mediated repression of basal sCLU expression was not
explored. As prior data suggested that IGF-1 signaling may regulate sCLU expression
(Criswell et al., 2005) and that p53 was regulated, through Mdm-2 expression, by IGF-1
(Mayo and Donner, 2001), we examined the ability of p53 to regulate IGF-1 transcription.
To test this, the IGF-1 promoter fused to luciferase reporter (IGF-1–LUC) (Mittanck et al.,
1997) was transfected into a series of genetically matched cell lines altered in functional p53
(Figure 1a). p53-null (PC3 and HCT116 p53−/−) and p53 knockdown (RKO7 shp53,
HCT116:3-6 shp53, HBEC 3kt shp53) cells had higher basal IGF-1 promoter activity
compared with matched WT p53-expressing cells (white bars; PC3 (stably expressing WT
p53), RKO7 SCR, HCT116 SCR, HCT116:3-6 SCR and HBEC 3kt). Immortalized human
bronchial epithelial (HBEC 3kt, WT p53) cells expressing mutant R273H p53 (mp53) also
had elevated basal IGF-1 promoter activity. Similarly, IGF-1 mRNA and protein expression
was higher in HCT116:3-6 shp53 compared with SCR cells (Figures 1b and c). These data
suggested that p53 transcriptionally repressed basal IGF-1 in a dose-dependent manner, as
complete loss of functional p53 allowed for greater IGF-1 expression than in cells where
p53 was knocked down.
As IGF-1R signaling is activated by IR exposure (Criswell et al., 2005), we examined
whether IGF-1 was elevated after IR exposure, and if its expression was dependent on p53
status. In RKO7 SCR and shp53 cells, IGF-1 protein and promoter activity was induced in
both cell lines after IR exposure. However, IGF-1 was induced to a significantly greater
extent when p53 was knocked down (Figures 1d and e). These data strongly suggested that
p53 transcriptionally repressed basal IGF-1 expression, while only partially blocking IROncogene. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2016 March 25.

induced IGF-1. The data also suggested that the p53 repression mechanism of IGF-1 (and
sCLU) was fundamentally different than other p53 targets, such as Chk2, as Chk2 is further
suppressed after IR exposure owing to stabilization of p53 (Matsui et al., 2004).
p53 and NF-Y-mediated transcriptional regulation of IGF-1

Author Manuscript

As IGF-1 was induced in WT p53 cells after IR exposure even though p53 was stabilized,
we investigated the mechanism of p53 suppression, and whether this changed after IR.
Interrogation of the human IGF-1 promoter for potential regulatory elements repressed by
p53 led to the identification of a single NF-Y consensus site found at −438 bp in the IGF-1
promoter (Figure 2a). NF-Y sites are bound by NF-Y proteins, which are trimeric
transcription factor complexes comprised of NF-YA, -YB and -YC proteins. NF-Y can
interact with p53 to transcriptionally repress specific genes, including Cdc2 and Chk2 (Yun
et al., 1999; Matsui et al., 2004). To determine whether the NF-Y consensus site in the
IGF-1 promoter was required for transcriptional repression by p53, we mutated the site
(Figures 2a and b). Dramatically increased activity in HCT116 cells was observed with the
NF-Y mutant IGF-1 promoter (NF-Y MUT), similar to the activity of the WT IGF-1
promoter in HCT116 p53−/− cells (Figure 2b). Thus, p53 suppressed basal IGF-1 promoter
activity through an NF-Y binding site in HCT116 cells.

Author Manuscript

To examine whether NF-Y alone could repress the IGF-1 promoter in the absence of p53,
NF-YA was overexpressed in HCT116 cells. NF-YA overexpression in HCT116 cells
resulted in modest repression of the IGF-1 promoter; however, NF-YA was not able to
suppress in the absence of p53 (HCT116 p53−/−, Figure 2c), consistent with studies showing
that NF-YA mediates the interaction between p53 and DNA (Imbriano et al., 2005). Finally,
chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses were performed to examine the binding of p53 and
NF-YA, -YB or -YC to the IGF-1 promoter. After IR exposure, p53 protein levels were
stabilized (Figure 2d); however, p53 and NF-YA binding to the IGF-1 promoter decreased.
NF-YB and NF-YC binding increased 72 h after IR exposure (Figure 2e). Intriguingly, NFYB binding to the IGF-1 promoter decreased 6 h after IR exposure; however, as IGF-1 and
sCLU are most robustly induced 48–72 h after IR exposure, decreased binding at 6 h may
not affect IGF-1 expression. As a positive control, increased p53 binding to the p21
promoter was noted after IR exposure (Figure 2e). These data suggest that IGF-1 induction
after IR exposure in WT p53 cells was due to loss of p53 and NF-YA occupancy on the
IGF-1 promoter, and thereby loss of repression. These data strongly suggest that NF-YA is
rate limiting and p53 alone is not capable of repressing IGF-1.
p53 suppression of the IGF-1–sCLU pathway

Author Manuscript

To show that IGF-1 signaling was upstream of sCLU expression, cells were treated with
AG1024, an IGF-1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor, before IR exposure. AG1024 blocked IRinduced CLU promoter activity in RKO7 shp53 cells, while having no effect on IGF-1
promoter induction (Figure 3a). The overall lower induction of IGF-1 and CLU promoter
activity observed in the WT p53 RKO7 cells was probably due to the low serum conditions
required for AG1024 efficacy. To determine if both IGF-1 and CLU expression were
similarly regulated by p53, HCT116 and HCT116 p53−/− cells were transiently transfected
with WT flag-tagged p53 cDNA (WT p53) and IGF-1– or CLU–LUC reporters before IR

exposure. Basal IGF-1 and CLU promoter activities were significantly higher in HCT116
p53−/− cells compared with WT p53 cells (Figure 3b), consistent with previous results.
Overexpression of non-lethal p53 levels partially blocked IR-induced IGF-1 and CLU
promoter activities in both cell lines (Figure 3b). CLU and IGF-1 promoter activity and
sCLU protein induction after IR exposure were also partially blocked by p53 in RKO7 cells
(Supplementary Figures S1A–C). As both IGF-1 and CLU were similarly regulated by p53,
an inter-dependent relationship between the expression patterns of these two genes was
revealed, showing that upstream IGF-1 expression directly controlled sCLU synthesis.
Induction of sCLU by DNA damage

Author Manuscript

As IGF-1R signaling was required for sCLU induction after IR exposure, we examined
whether this pathway was activated after other forms of DNA damage. In RKO7 cells,
induction of both the intracellular, ~60-kDa precursor sCLU (psCLU) and the ~80-kDa
mature sCLU, appearing as an ~40-kDa smear, were noted after exposure to IR, H2O2 or
topoisomerase I or IIa poisons, topotecan (TPT) and VP16, respectively (Figures 4a and c).
Induction of sCLU was inhibited by AG1024 pre-treatment (Figure 4a). IGF-1 expression
and phosphorylation of ERK were observed after DNA damage (Figure 4b and
Supplementary Figures S2A–C), consistent with IGF-1R–mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) activation after IR exposure (Criswell et al., 2005). These data suggested a
common DNA damage-induced pathway of IGF-1 induction that activates IGF-1R–MAPK
signaling, leading to sCLU expression.

Author Manuscript

To determine whether DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) were necessary for sCLU
induction, cells were exposed to aphidicolin (Aph), a DNA polymerase α inhibitor, before
treatment with various DNA-damaging agents. Topotecan, a topoisomerase-I poison, causes
DNA–protein crosslinks that are converted to DSBs during DNA replication, which are
prevented by Aph (D’Arpa et al., 1990). Aph abrogated TPT-induced sCLU protein
expression and CLU promoter activity in RKO7 cells (Figures 4c and d). In contrast, Aph
did not affect sCLU induction for the agents that directly caused DSBs. These data
suggested that DSBs were minimally sufficient to induce sCLU.
The IGF-1–sCLU expression axis is upregulated in genetically unstable cells

Author Manuscript

Noting that DSBs were minimally required for IGF-1– sCLU expression (Figures 4c and d)
and that genetically unstable cells commonly exhibit constitutive DSBs, we examined
whether genetic instability, in general, led to an increase in sCLU expression. Various
genetically unstable cells were examined for IGF-1 and sCLU expression compared with
their stable, genetically matched cells (Figures 5a and b). Cells deficient in H2AX
(H2AX−/−) have defective localization of BRCA1 and 53BP1, deficiencies in homologous
recombination and persistent DSBs (Celeste et al., 2002). Elevated basal expression of
sCLU was noted in H2AX−/− MEFs compared with their genetically matched and stable,
WT counterparts. Similarly, sCLU expression was constitutively elevated in MDC1−/−
MEFs, which have defects in ATM recruitment (but not activation), leading to increased
DSBs and genetic instability (Lou et al., 2006). sCLU expression was also elevated in fifth
generation MEFs defective for the RNA component of mouse telomerase, mTR (Figure 5a);
mTR−/− MEFs are genetically unstable owing to a failure to extend telomere ends, revealing

DSBs that lead to chromosomal rearrangements and end-to-end fusions (Hao and Greider,
2004). Genetically unstable NBS1−/− MEFs (Zhu et al., 2001) and mismatch repair-deficient
(MMR, hMLH1-deficient) HCT116 cells (Wagner et al., 2008) also exhibited elevated basal
sCLU expression compared with their matched, genetically stable WT counterparts (Figure
5b).

Author Manuscript

We then examined whether IGF-1 signaling was elevated in cells with endogenous genetic
instability. Elevated IGF-1 and CLU promoter activity was noted in H2AX−/− MEFs,
compared with WT control cells (Figure 5c). Higher levels of intracellular IGF-1 in
H2AX−/− MEFs were noted (Supplementary Figure S2D), with constitutively elevated basal
phosphorylation of IGF-1R, AKT1 and ERK (Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S2E).
Exposure of both MEFs to exogenous IGF-1 induced phosphorylation of IGF-1R and its
downstream target, AKT1 (Supplementary Figure S2E), confirming that IGF-1R signaling
was intact in WT MEFs. Finally, AG1024 exposure reduced basal sCLU expression in
H2AX−/−, MDC1−/− and mTR−/− MEFs (Figure 5e, and Supplementary Figures S2F and G),
suggesting that IGF-1/IGF-1R signaling was constitutively active in unstable cells, leading
to sCLU expression. These data strongly suggested that the same IGF-1/IGF-1R/
MAPK/ERK signaling pathway that was activated after exogenous DNA damage was
responsible for stimulating basal sCLU expression in genetically unstable cells.
sCLU induction following DNA damage is mediated by ATM

Author Manuscript

As IGF-1–sCLU expression was elevated in response to DNA damage, we wanted to
delineate the DNA damage sensor responsible for upregulating this expression axis. As
ATM and ATR signaling are activated in response to the DNA-damaging agents used, we
suspected that these two PIKKs might be involved in IGF-1–sCLU expression. The
genetically unstable MEFs were examined for upregulation of ATM signaling by analyzing
phosphorylation of H2AX (γ-H2AX) and auto-activation of ATM (phosphorylation of
S1981). Neither H2AX−/− nor MDC1−/− MEFs showed γ-H2AX staining due to their known
abrogation of this response (Lou et al., 2006), but had elevated basal pATMS1981 levels
(Figures 5f and g). WT MEFs were responsive to IR exposure, showing elevated
pATMS1981 and γ-H2AX staining (Figures 5f and g). Additionally, both pATMS1981 and γH2AX were elevated in RKO7 cells exposed to TPT, which were abrogated by Aph pretreatment (Supplementary Figure S3A). ATR signaling, as determined by Chk1
phosphorylation on serines 317 and 345, was elevated in H2AX-, MDC1- and mTRdeficient cells (Supplementary Figure S3B). These data suggested that both ATM and ATR
signaling were elevated under the same conditions in which IGF-1–sCLU expression was
upregulated.

Author Manuscript

The requirement for ATM or ATR activation in IGF-1/sCLU expression was examined by
pre-treating cells with the dual ATM and ATR kinase inhibitor (see Bentle et al., 2006).
ATR kinase inhibitor blocked pATMS1981 and γ-H2AX staining in irradiated MEF and
human cells (Supplementary Figures S4A and B), and lowered basal sCLU protein
expression in genetically unstable cells (Figure 6a). ATR kinase inhibitor also prevented
sCLU induction in MCF-7 cells following IR or TPT exposure (Figure 6b). Thus, either
ATM or ATR were possible DNA damage sensor kinases directing IGF-1–sCLU induction.

Author Manuscript

To delineate between ATM and ATR, sCLU induction was examined in genetically defined,
SV-40 immortalized AT fibroblasts (ATM−/−) compared with genetically matched, ATMreconstituted AT fibroblasts (ATM+/−). Although ATM−/− cells are genetically unstable
(Kojis et al., 1991) and sensitive to IR (Ziv et al., 1997), sCLU basal expression was equal
to that of ATM-corrected (ATM+/−) fibroblasts (Figures 6c and e, and Supplementary Figure
S5A), owing to the presence of IGF-1 in the culture medium. Importantly, ATM−/−
fibroblasts did not induce sCLU after IR exposure, unlike ATM+/− fibroblasts (Figure 6c).
Similarly, sCLU expression was not induced in GM2052 primary AT fibroblasts after IR
exposure (Figure 6d). As an important control, both ATM−/− and ATM+/− fibroblasts were
able to induce sCLU and showed phosphorylation of IGF-1R and Akt1 by exogenous IGF-1
(Supplementary Figures S5A and B), indicating that both cell lines were proficient in
IGF-1–sCLU expression, but not in signaling from DNA damage to sCLU induction.

Author Manuscript

The role of ATR signaling in IGF-1–sCLU expression was examined by exposing ATM−/−
and ATM+/− fibroblasts to UV (1 or 3 J/m2), which predominately activates ATR. Similar to
IR, sCLU induction was observed only in ATM+/− cells after UV treatment (Figure 6e),
probably due to ATR-dependent activation of ATM after UV exposure (Stiff et al., 2006).
As a control, p53-mediated DNA damage-inducible expression of the human homolog of
Mdm2 was noted in both ATM−/− and ATM+/− cells after UV exposure (Figure 6e) (Perry et
al., 1993). Also, Chk1S317 phosphorylation in UV-irradiated ATM−/− and ATM+/− cells was
noted (Figure 6e and Supplementary Figure S5C), confirming ATR activation (Zhao and
Piwnica-Worms, 2001). These data strongly suggested that ATM, and not ATR, was
necessary for sCLU induction after IR exposure.

Author Manuscript

As p53 and NF-YA binding to the IGF-1 promoter were lost after IR exposure in HCT116
cells, p53/NF-YA binding was examined in ATM+/− vs ATM−/− cells before and after IR.
As in HCT116 cells (Figure 2e), both p53 and NF-YA were lost from the IGF-1 promoter
after IR exposure in ATM+/−, although no change was detected in ATM−/− cells (Figure 6f).
These data strongly suggested that ATM signaling was important for loss of NF-YA and p53
from the IGF-1 promoter after IR exposure, and that alterations are required for IGF-1–
sCLU upregulation in response to DNA damage.

Author Manuscript

As ATM and ATM-activated proteins (for example, activated Chk2) phosphorylate p53 at
serines 15 and 20 after IR exposure, we examined whether these post-translational
modifications of p53 altered its ability to repress IGF-1 or sCLU. HCT116 p53−/− cells were
transiently transfected with WT p53, or p53 constructs containing serine 15 or 20 mutated to
non-phosphorylated alanine mutants (S15A, S20A), or phospho-mimic aspartate (S15D) or
glutamate mutants (S15E, S20E). All serine 15 and 20 mutants repressed IGF-1 and CLU
promoter activity similar to WT p53 (Supplementary Figures S5D and E), even though these
are obvious direct and indirect targets of ATM kinase activity after DNA damage. As a
positive control, the p21 promoter (el-Deiry et al., 1993) was induced by WT and to a lesser
extent by S15A, S15E and S20A p53 mutants (Supplementary Figure S5F) (Dumaz and
Meek, 1999). Mutation of S20 to glutamate enhanced p53-mediated activation of the p21
promoter over WT. Additionally, mutation of p53 at S20 blocked the ability of the DO1 p53
antibody to detect p53 (Supplementary Figure S5F, right). Thus, our data strongly suggested
that activation of ATM signaling, and not ATR, was sufficient to induce IGF-1–sCLU

expression, a common damage-inducible pro-survival expression axis initiated by genotoxic
stress or genetic instability.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Genetic instability is a hallmark of cancer initiation, triggering changes that induce a switch
from normal to uncontrolled growth. Engagement of survival pathways within these aberrant
cells is important for cancer promotion and progression. Our results integrate a novel
signaling pathway, initiating from ATM, that activates the pro-survival IGF-1–sCLU axis
due to endogenous or exogenous DNA damage (Figure 6g). All cytotoxic agents that
induced DSBs and activated ATM kinase led to IGF-1 induction and subsequent activation
of IGF-1R, leading to sCLU expression. In normal cells, transient upregulation of IGF-1–
sCLU expression after DNA damage is most likely beneficial, blocking apoptosis, providing
a mitogenic stimulus and mobilizing glucose utilization to maintain cellular homeostasis
until DNA repair is concluded. When this pathway is uncontrolled, however, like in
genetically unstable cells or by loss of p53 function, IGF-1–sCLU upregulation may
promote resistance of tumors to IR or chemotherapies and allow initiated cells to progress.

Author Manuscript

Several studies have suggested links between ATM, p53 and IGF-1 signaling, but this is the
first report to show that p53, in conjunction with NF-YA, directly suppresses the IGF-1
promoter (Figures 6f and g). Other studies suggested that p53 suppressed IGF-1; however,
no mechanistic data were provided (Bocchetta et al., 2008; Sulkowski et al., 2009).
Additionally, ATM upregulates IGF-1R expression, and loss of IGF-1R, in turn, blocks
ATM activation after IR exposure (Macaulay et al., 2001; Shahrabani-Gargir et al., 2004).
These observations appear to explain the biphasic activation of IGF-1R–MAPK signaling
observed in MCF-7 cells after IR exposure (Criswell et al., 2005). Initial IGF-1 signaling by
ATM activation could trigger a more robust positive feedback loop, wherein IR-induced
IGF-1 signaling activates AKT1. AKT1 stimulation then leads to p53 degradation via
activation of Mdm2 (Leri et al., 1999), resulting in robust but delayed synthesis of IGF-1–
sCLU. This may also explain the slower kinetics of IGF-1 induction in RKO7 SCR cells,
compared with RKO7 shp53 cells, because the RKO7 shp53 cells already have lowered p53
(Figure 1e).

Author Manuscript

NF-Y A–C proteins bind p53 and suppress transcription of target genes involved in cell
cycle regulation, such as Cdc2 and Chk2 (Yun et al., 1999; Matsui et al., 2004). These genes
are suppressed after DNA damage by p53 stabilization (Matsui et al., 2004). In contrast,
IGF-1–sCLU expression was induced after low- (⩾2 cGy) and high-dose IR exposures, even
though p53 was stabilized (Klokov et al., 2004). This was concomitant with the
simultaneous loss of NF-YA and p53 binding to the IGF-1 promoter. NF-YB and NF-YC
binding increased after IR exposure (Figure 2e), consistent with their abilities to bind TFIID
independently of NF-YA and promote transcription (Bellorini et al., 1997). Even though the
mechanism of IGF-1 suppression by p53 and NF-YA is different from other known targets,
it is not incongruous with the known functions of the NF-Y subunits.
As we uncovered a novel mechanism of p53/NF-YA-mediated suppression of IGF-1
transcription, we propose several possibilities for this loss of suppression after IR exposure,

including post-translational modification of NF-YA and/or p53. Cdk2 can phosphorylate
NF-YA, and mutation of these sites blocked its ability to bind DNA (Yun et al., 2003). We
propose a model whereby Cdk2 promotes NF-YA phosphorylation in the basal state,
enhancing p53/NF-YA binding to DNA and repressing IGF-1 promoter transactivation.
After IR exposure, ATM-mediated p53 stabilization promotes p21 expression. p21, in turn,
suppresses Cdk2, blocking NF-YA phosphorylation and releasing NF-YA from the IGF-1
promoter (Figures 2e and 6f). Additionally, acetylation, phosphorylation or other posttranslational modifications of p53 may have an impact on its ability to bind NF-YA and
repress IGF-1 transcription. Studies to elucidate the roles of NF-YA and p53 posttranslational modifications are ongoing. Collectively, our data indicate that ATM signaling
results in NF-YA modification to prevent or reverse its binding to the IGF-1 promoter,
suggesting that NF-YA is rate-limiting and cells retain the ability to induce IGF-1
expression and downstream sCLU production even after IR exposure, even though p53 is
stabilized.

Author Manuscript

p53 null cells, or cells with p53 knockdown, induced IGF-1–sCLU to a much greater extent
after IR exposure compared with WT p53 cells. These data suggest that a positive
transcription factor, in addition to loss of p53/NF-YA from the IGF-1 promoter, is required
for IGF-1 induction. There are several candidate factors, including NF-YB/-YC itself, AIB1
or TGFb1 signaling, that may regulate IGF-1 expression. NF-Y is a known IR-activated
transcription factor (Peng et al., 2007), and NF-YB/-YC complexes may act as positive
transcription factors for IGF-1 induction after IR exposure, consistent with increased NFYB/-YC binding to the IGF-1 promoter (Figure 2e). On the other hand, levels of the steroid
receptor coactivator, AIB1, are directly correlated with IGF-1 expression (Wang et al.,
2000). AIB1 binds to the IGF-1 promoter with AP-1 (Yan et al., 2006), suggesting that
changes in these complexes may regulate IGF-1 expression after IR exposure. Finally, as
TGFb1 induces sCLU (Jin and Howe, 1997) and TGFb1 signaling can be activated after IR
exposure (Andarawewa et al., 2007), TGFb1 signaling may be involved in IR-induced
IGF-1. Current studies are ongoing in our lab to elucidate the positive factors in induction of
IGF-1 after DNA damaging agents.
In conclusion, we elucidated the complete signaling pathway from DNA damage to sCLU
expression. By determining the signaling pathways involved in IGF-1–sCLU upregulation,
important targets for anti-tumor therapy emerge, as well as the possibility of using IGF-1
and sCLU as markers for genetic instability and cancer progression.

Cell treatments
AG1024 IGF-1 was treated with etoposide, topotecan, Aph, N-acetyl cysteine, and ATR
kinase inhibitor (CGK733). Cells were plated overnight, treated with TPT, H2O2 or VP16
(Sigma, St Louis, MO, USA) for 5 h at the indicated doses, and medium replaced. Pretreatment with Aph (Sigma) was done for 2 h before treatment. For IGF-1 (R&D Systems,
Minneapolis, MN, USA) and AG1024 treatments (EMD Chemicals, Gibbstown, NJ, USA),
cells were serum-starved (0.5% FBS) overnight, and exposed to IGF-1 or AG1024 at the

indicated doses. A JL Shepherd 137Cs Mark I-68 irradiator (3.87 Gy/min) was used for IR
exposures. Mock and DMSO-treated cells were used as controls (UT).
Plasmids and site-directed mutagenesis
The IGF-1 promoter fused to luciferase was from Dr P Rotwein (Mittanck et al., 1997). The
CLU promoter fused to luciferase was previously described (Criswell et al., 2005). Flagtagged CMV-p53 cDNA was created by subcloning p53 cDNA into the pcDNA3.1-N-termFlag construct. NF-YA cDNA was provided by Dr R Mantovani (Mantovani et al., 1994).
Site-directed mutagenesis of p53 cDNAs and the IGF-1 promoter was performed using
PCR-based mutagenesis, detailed in the Supplementary Material.
Luciferase reporter assays

Author Manuscript

Cells were transiently transfected with various promoter luciferase constructs as indicated,
and with RSV-β-gal as a transfection control, using Fugene 6 (Roche). Treatments, where
indicated, were performed 24 h after transfection. Luciferase activities were analyzed using
Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). β-Galactosidase activity was
determined using Galacto-Star reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA).
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays
IGF-1 was detected using capture and detection antibodies MAB291 and BAF291 (R&D
Systems). Samples were normalized by cell number.
Flow cytometry

Author Manuscript

Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 100% ethanol, stained with
pATMS1981 (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA, USA), γ-H2AX (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA),
and IGF-1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) antibodies and FITC-tagged
secondary antibodies (Life Technologies), and counterstained with propidium iodide. Data
were graphed as percent cells staining positive ±s.d.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde, sonicated to shear chromatin, and incubated overnight
with antibodies against p53, NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC (Santa Cruz). Protein A/G beads
were added the next day, then washed extensively. Chromatin was eluted from beads, crosslinks reversed and DNA purified. Primers are listed in Supplementary Material.
Western blotting

Author Manuscript

Western blotting was described previously (Criswell et al., 2005). GAPDH, β-actin or αtubulin was probed as loading controls. Relative expression was calculated from X-ray films
using Image J, comparing the relative density of experimental conditions with a loading
control. Control values were set to 1.
Statistics
Statistics were calculated using paired Student’s t-tests (n⩾ 3), and each experiment was
performed at least three times.
