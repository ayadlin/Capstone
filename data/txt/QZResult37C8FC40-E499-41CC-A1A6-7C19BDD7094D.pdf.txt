ABSTRACT
ACY-241 is a novel, orally available and selective histone deacetylase (HDAC)
6 inhibitor in Phase 1b clinical development in multiple myeloma (NCT 02400242).
Like the structurally related drug ACY-1215 (ricolinostat), ACY-241 has the potential
for a substantially reduced side effect profile versus current nonselective HDAC
inhibitor drug candidates due to reduced potency against Class I HDACs while
retaining the potential for anticancer effectiveness. We now show that combination
treatment of xenograft models with paclitaxel and either ricolinostat or ACY-241
significantly suppresses solid tumor growth. In cell lines from multiple solid tumor
lineages, combination treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel enhanced inhibition of
proliferation and increased cell death relative to either single agent alone. Combination
treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel also resulted in more frequent occurrence of
mitotic cells with abnormal multipolar spindles and aberrant mitoses, consistent with
the observed increase of aneuploid cells. At the molecular level, multipolar mitotic
spindle formation was observed to be NuMA-dependent and γ-tubulin independent,
suggesting that treatment-induced multipolar spindle formation does not depend
on centrosomal amplification. The significantly enhanced efficacy of ACY-241 plus
paclitaxel observed here, in addition to the anticipated superior safety profile of a
selective HDAC6 inhibitor versus pan-HDAC inhibitors, provides a strong rationale
for clinical development of this combination in patients with advanced solid tumors.

INTRODUCTION

showed that paclitaxel treatment suppressed microtubule
dynamic instability and induced multi-aster formation [10].
Dynamic instability is a critical regulator of
microtubule biology. Microtubules are complex
polymers that repeatedly undergo rapid and stochastic
transitions between growth and contraction, thus enabling
localized changes for specific physiologic purposes,
for example, mitotic spindle formation during mitosis
[11, 12]. This instability is tightly regulated by multiple
posttranslational modifications, including acetylation
of lysine-40 of α-tubulin [13, 14], but is also sensitive
to microtubule disrupting agents, including paclitaxel
and other taxane drugs [15, 16]. Amongst many known
regulators of α-tubulin posttranslational modification,
histone deacetylase (HDAC) 6 is the major deacetylase
of lysine-40 [17].

Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent approved for
use in the treatment of multiple solid tumor types, including
breast cancer, ovarian cancer, non-small cell lung cancer
and Kaposi’s sarcoma [1–3]. As a microtubule-stabilizing
drug, high concentrations of paclitaxel induce mitotic
arrest followed by apoptosis or mitotic slippage, which
had been recognized as the major mechanism of action
for the treatment of tumors [4–7]. However, recent studies
indicate that lower concentrations of paclitaxel, similar
to levels observed within the tumors of treated patients,
caused multipolar mitotic spindle formation, subsequently
resulting in aberrant mitosis and cell death, which likely
also contributes to the anti-cancer efficacy of paclitaxel
[8, 9]. Consistent with this discovery, live cell imaging

RESULTS

HDAC inhibitors are an emerging class of
anticancer agents that includes the FDA approved drugs
vorinostat, romidepsin, and belinostat for the treatment
of cutaneous and/or peripheral T cell lymphoma, and
panobinostat for the treatment of multiple myeloma.
Non-selective pan-HDAC inhibitors, that broadly target
multiple members of the HDAC enzyme family, result in
anticancer efficacy through regulation of the acetylation
state of lysine residues in both histone and non-histone
proteins [18–22]. Combinations of HDAC inhibitors
with chemotherapeutic agents, including taxanes, have
demonstrated evidence of clinical benefit, for example
in ovarian cancer combining belinostat with carboplatin
and paclitaxel [23], and in advanced non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) combining vorinostat with carboplatin
and paclitaxel [24]. Preclinical enhancement of
combination efficacy of HDAC inhibitors and paclitaxel
has also been demonstrated in models of ovarian,
anaplastic thyroid, and breast cancer [25–27]. Though
the underlying mechanism is still not fully understood,
these studies did demonstrate enhancement of antitumor
activity in combination with multiple pan-selective
HDAC inhibitors, including vorinostat, valproic acid,
and romidepsin. Unfortunately, the toxicity profile of
pan-HDAC inhibitors frequently limits their use in
combination with other drugs commonly used in the
treatment of hematologic and solid tumors [19, 20].
Such tolerability concerns have motivated the
identification and development of more selective HDAC
inhibitors with improved safety profiles. Ricolinostat,
the first-in-class HDAC6 selective inhibitor, has recently
demonstrated acceptable tolerability and preliminary
evidence of anti-myeloma efficacy upon combination
treatment with lenalidomide and dexamethasone, as
well as pharmacodynamic evidence of both HDAC6 and
Class I HDAC inhibition in patients [28]. Amongst other
effects, inhibition of HDAC6 results in hyperacetylation
of α-tubulin, which has been shown to increase
microtubule stability against cold and nocodazole induced
depolymerization [13], suggesting that inhibition of HDAC6
by selective or pan-HDAC inhibitors may contribute to
enhanced efficacy in combination with taxanes.
Here, paclitaxel treatment in combination with
ACY-241, a second generation HDAC6 selective drug,
further impacted the growth and viability of cell lines
derived from multiple solid tumor lineages. Combination
treatment caused significantly increased inhibition of
tumor cell proliferation through enhanced reduction of
S-phase, and was associated with increased frequency of
abnormal multipolar mitotic spindle formation, induction
of aneuploidy, and increased cell death. These findings
provide supportive rationale for the clinical evaluation of
ACY-241 in combination with paclitaxel in patients with
advanced solid tumors, which is currently being tested in
clinical trial NCT02551185.

Selective inhibition of HDAC6 by ACY-241
ACY-241 was designed as a second generation
orally available and HDAC6 selective inhibitor with
improved solubility properties over the structurally
related inhibitor ricolinostat (Figure 1A; Table 1). Like
ricolinostat, ACY-241 exhibits potent biochemical
inhibition of HDAC6 with 13–18-fold reduced potency
against the nuclear Class I HDACs (HDAC1, HDAC2,
and HDAC3; Table 1). In A2780 ovarian cancer cells,
24 hour treatment with 300 nM ACY-241 resulted in
increased hyperacetylation of α-tubulin, consistent with
inhibition of the tubulin deacetylase HDAC6 (Figure 1B).
In contrast, hyperacetylation of histone H3, a target of
Class I HDACs, was only observed at doses above 1 µM.
This result confirms that low exposures of ACY-241 result
in selective inhibition of HDAC6, while higher exposures
leads to inhibition of Class I HDAC isozymes.

Combination treatment with paclitaxel reduced
xenograft growth and cellular proliferation of
solid tumor cancer cells
Based on prior evidence of efficacy from paclitaxel
and HDAC inhibitor combination treatment, the anticancer potential of paclitaxel in combination with
selective HDAC6 inhibitors was assessed in multiple solid
tumor xenograft models, including those of ovarian and
pancreatic cancer origins. Combination treatment of TOV21G, A2780, and MiaPaCa-2 xenografts with ricolinostat
plus paclitaxel resulted in significantly greater suppression
of tumor growth relative to either single agent (Figure 2A,
B and C, respectively). Likewise, ACY-241 exhibited
similarly significant efficacy in combination with
paclitaxel in the MiaPaCa-2 xenograft model (Figure 2D).
Importantly, ricolinostat and ACY-241 were well tolerated
in mice when dosed as a single agent and in combination
with paclitaxel (Figure 2E and 2F, respectively). Together,
these results demonstrate substantial anti-cancer efficacy
of both ACY-241 and ACY-1215 in combination with
paclitaxel in xenograft models.
The potential of ACY-241 and paclitaxel to reduce
proliferation upon combination treatment was also assessed
in cell lines generated from multiple solid tumor types (e.g.
pancreatic, ovarian, and breast cancer). The single agent
viability IC50 of ACY-241 and paclitaxel ranged from
4.6 – 6.1 μM and 2.3 – 3.2 nM, respectively, in A2780
and TOV-21G ovarian cancer and MDA-MD-231 breast
cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S1A, S1B). Single
agent dose response was also assessed in a long term
live-cell imaging proliferation assay using the IncuCyte®
platform (Supplementary Figure S1C, S1D). Briefly,

In vitro combination efficacy was initially assessed
in the MDA-MB-231 cell line by selecting single agent
doses of each agent that only partially suppressed
proliferation. Upon combination treatment there was
significantly reduced proliferation and enhanced apoptosis
relative to either single agent (Supplementary Figure
S1C, S1D; right panels). To further assess combination
efficacy, MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer, TOV-21G ovarian
cancer, and T47D breast cancer cells were treated with
ACY-241, paclitaxel, or the combination and relative
cell proliferation was monitored over a 9 day treatment
period (Figure 3A, 3B). While each single agent was only
partially active at the selected concentrations, combination
treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel significantly
inhibited proliferation and this effect was maintained
throughout the treatment period (Figure 3B).

nucleus-restricted Red Fluorescent Protein were incubated
with the indicated doses of each compound alone or in
combination and absolute cell number was determined in
real-time (Supplementary Figure S1C). Additionally, nontoxic Caspase 3/7 Reagent was added to each culture well
for real-time detection of the induction of apoptosis due to
substrate cleavage by Caspase 3/7 (Supplementary Figure
S1D). Consistent with the viability assay, single agent
ACY-241 modestly reduced proliferation at doses up to 3
μM without inducing apoptosis, while 10 μM of ACY-241
caused significant induction of apoptosis and completely
suppressed proliferation (Supplementary Figure S1C, S1D;
left panels). Similarly, single agent paclitaxel modestly
reduced cell proliferation up to 2 nM and did induce
apoptosis after longer duration of exposure (Supplementary
Figure S1C, S1D; middle panels).

content (representing G1 and G2/M phase cells) were
also detected. Similar populations were observed after
treatment with either ACY-241 or paclitaxel as single
agents, but after combination treatment fewer S phase
cells were detected and the remaining cell populations
exhibited an irregular distribution of DNA content (Figure
4A). This observation suggests that combination treatment
results in reduced cell cycle progression and accumulation
of cells with variable DNA content, consistent with the
induction of aneuploidy due to a possible defect in mitosis.
Analysis of multiple cell lines (A2780 and TOV21G ovarian cells; MiaPaCa-2 pancreatic cancer cells)

To assess if decreased proliferation after
combination treatment was associated with effects on
cell cycle progression, A2780 ovarian cancer cells were
treated with ACY-241 (2 µM), paclitaxel (3 nM), or
the combination of both agents, and relative cell cycle
distribution was assessed by EdU incorporation. As
shown in the flow cytometry dot plots in Figure 4A,
vehicle treated cells were actively replicating DNA
in S phase, and populations of cells with distinct DNA

treatment of (A) TOV-21G and (B) A2780 ovarian cancer with ricolinostat plus paclitaxel resulted in significantly greater suppression

confirmed that combination treatment with ACY-241 and
paclitaxel significantly reduced the percentage of cells
in S phase, thus reducing cell cycling (Figure 4B). The
reduction in S phase cells after combination treatment
was significantly enhanced over either single agent
at these concentrations. Consistent with prior studies
[8, 9], high concentrations of paclitaxel (100 nM)
alone induced cell cycle arrest at mitosis (M) phase, as
demonstrated by increasing frequency of phospho-histone
H3 (pH3) positive cells from 8 to 24 hours after treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2A). In contrast, low dose
paclitaxel (6 nM) resulted in accumulation of M phase
cells (14% pH3 positive cells vs 2.6% pH3 positive with
DMSO treatment) within 8 hours of treatment, consistent
with the induction of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC)dependent mitotic arrest at this dose level. However,
most of the accumulated mitotic cells under low dose
treatment eventually resolved their arrested mitoses
with prolonged treatment time. This is indicated by the
decreased percentage of pH3 positive cells (4.1% pH3
positive cells) after longer treatment time (24 hours),
suggesting these cells overcame a cell cycle checkpoint
and resolved mitosis. Similar results were also observed
upon combination treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel,
further supporting an apparent impact of the treatment on
mitosis (Supplementary Figure S2A). Consistent with this

observation, cell morphology also showed that cells treated
with the combination of ACY-241 with low dose paclitaxel
were able to exit mitosis and reattach to the culture
surface, while cells treated with high dose paclitaxel (100
nM) were arrested at M phase and remained spherical
(Supplementary Figure S2B). Thus, combination treatment
at these doses significantly reduced cell cycling but did not
completely block cell cycle progression. Beyond reduction
of cell cycling, combination treatment also significantly
increased induction of cell death relative to control or
single agent treatment (Figure 4C). Consistent with
reduced proliferation and inhibition of tumor growth, these
findings confirm that ACY-241 treatment in combination
with paclitaxel reduces cell cycle progression and results
in the accumulation of cells with abnormal DNA content.

Combination treatment with ACY-241 and
paclitaxel enhances α-tubulin acetylation
At the molecular level, treatment with paclitaxel
results in enhanced stability of microtubules, which in turn
leads to increased acetylation of α-tubulin [29]. Likewise,
HDAC6 actively regulates acetylation of α-tubulin, and
ACY-241 treatment results in a dose-dependent increase in
α-tubulin hyperacetylation (Figure 1B). Upon combination
treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel a synergistic

increase in α-tubulin hyperacetylation was detected in
A2780 and MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 5). Thus, the
enhanced anti-cancer efficacy resulting from combination
treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel in cell lines was
associated with further increased hyperacetylation of
α-tubulin, suggesting these agents synergistically impact
the regulation of tubulin biology.

In addition to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis,
treatment with low concentrations of paclitaxel was
previously shown to result in formation of multipolar

mitotic spindles during mitosis, subsequently resulting
in aberrant cell divisions and cell death [8, 9]. Consistent
with this previous observation, α-tubulin staining
demonstrated that the frequency of multipolar mitotic
spindle formation in paclitaxel (2 nM) treated TOV-21G
ovarian cancer cells increased to 15.2% (n = 30/196
mitotic cells), compared with 3.1% (n = 2/65) in control
treated cells (Supplementary Figure S3). The frequency of
multipolar spindle formation in either ACY-241 (2 μM) or
ACY-1215 (2 μM) treated cells also increased to 10.7%
(n = 6/56) and 12.6% (n = 11/87), respectively. Importantly,
a greater than additive increase in the frequency of
multipolar spindle formation to 38.6% (n = 61/158) and
41.3% (n = 150) was observed in response to combination
treatment with either ACY-241 or ACY-1215, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S3). To better assess multipolar
spindle formation, co-staining was performed for the
spindle pole marker Nuclear Mitotic Apparatus (NuMA)
[9, 30] and α-tubulin to visualize individual spindle
poles in mitotic TOV-21G cells. This immunostaining
demonstrated that all observed multipolar α-tubulin
spindles formed with NuMA-containing spindle poles
(Figure 6A) and confirmed that combination treatment
with ACY-241 significantly increased the frequency of
multipolar spindle formation from 30.4% with single agent
paclitaxel treatment to 51.5% with combination treatment
(p = 0.0047; Figure 6B). Interestingly, other microtubule
stabilizing drugs, including taccalonolides and sagopilone
(fully synthetic epothilone B), also induce multipolar
spindle formation in a dose-dependent manner [10, 31].
Consistent with this, treatment of TOV-21G cells with
epothilone (0.5 nM) increased the frequency of multipolar
mitotic spindle formation to 29.9% (n = 38/127 mitotic
cells) relative to 0.9% (1/107) in control treated cells
(Supplementary Figure S4). Combination treatment with
epothilone and ACY-241 resulted in a greater than additive

increase in the frequency of multipolar spindle formation
to 51.3% (n = 59/115), suggesting that ACY-241 may
be efficacious in combination with a broad spectrum of
microtubule stabilizing drugs (Supplementary Figure S4).
Multipolar spindles are commonly associated with
abnormal centrosome number [32], thus co-staining
was performed for α-tubulin and the centrosome marker
γ-tubulin to further characterize multipolar spindle
formation in TOV-21G cells. Double staining showed that
multipolar spindles formed upon paclitaxel or combination
treatment did not always co-localize with γ-tubulin
(Figure 6C), suggesting that multipolar spindle formation
occurs independent of centrosome amplification.

Multipolar cell divisions are associated with cell
death and nuclear abnormalities
Multipolar spindle formation frequently results in
multipolar cell division, which can be followed by cell
death [33]. To directly test whether cell death occurs
after multipolar spindle formation upon treatment with
ACY-241 and paclitaxel, live cells were observed by
time-lapse microscopy for 48 hours following treatment.
Consistent with enhanced multipolar spindle formation by
ACY-241 (Figure 6A, 6B), live cell imaging also showed
that combination treatment increased the frequency of
multipolar cell division compared to each single agent
(Supplementary Figure S5A). As specific examples,
Supplementary Figure S5B and Supplementary Video S1
track two representative mitotic cells through mitosis over
48 hours of combination treatment. The first cell clearly
proceeded through multipolar cell division (Supplementary
Figure S5Ba and S5Ba’, inside yellow circle) to produce
two daughter cells, one of which was binucleated due
to immediate cell fusion. Chromosomal fragmentation
(Supplementary Figure S5Bb and S5Bc, dashed yellow

circle) and cell morphology (Supplementary Figure S5Bb’
and S5Bc’) show that these two daughter cells died at 8
and 12 hours after entering anaphase, respectively (see
also Video S1). A second cell also proceeded through
multipolar cell division (Supplementary Figure S5B, red
circle) to generate daughter cells that then fused into one
large, multinucleated cell that eventually died 17 hours
after entering anaphase (Supplementary Figure S5Be
and S5Be’, dashed red circle). A third cell death also
occurred in the observation area (Supplementary Figure
S5Bd and S5Bd’, dashed green circle) of a binucleated
cell that moved into the observation area (Supplementary
Figure S5B, green circle), suggesting it may be a daughter
cell generated from an additional aberrant mitosis. These
live cell imaging data are consistent with combination
treatment resulting in multipolar cell division that can lead
directly to atypical cells and cell death.
While multipolar cell division can be followed by
cell death, a subset of cells with multipolar spindles can
still complete mitosis and generate G1 daughter cells
with abnormal nuclei [33]. Consistent with the increased
frequency of multipolar spindle formation, combination
treatment with ACY-241 and paclitaxel also significantly
increased the frequency of cells with visually abnormal
nuclei, including satellite nuclei and multinucleation
(Figure 6D). This finding of more frequent aberrant
mitoses is consistent with the observed increase in cell
cycle arrest, aberrant DNA content, and increased cell
death, likely contributing to the increased anti-cancer
efficacy of this combination.

progression by inhibiting the anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome [34]. However, recent studies
demonstrate that while high doses of paclitaxel induce
mitotic arrest, clinically relevant low concentrations of
paclitaxel increased the frequency of multipolar spindle
formation and subsequently increased the rate of aberrant
mitosis and cell death [9]. In fact, paclitaxel has been
shown to increase the frequency of multipolar spindle
formation in xenograft tumors [35].
Formation of bipolar mitotic spindles is required
for correct segregation of daughter chromosomes during
mitosis. However, multipolar spindles are commonly
observed in human tumor specimens, frequently in
association with abnormal centrosome number [32].
However, multipolar spindle formation induced by
paclitaxel does not occur via these routes as tumors from
patients treated with paclitaxel show multipolar spindles
in the absence of centrosome amplification [9]. In this
prior study, NuMA staining demonstrated the presence of
additional spindles, but these additional spindles did not
always colocalize to centrosomes containing γ-tubulin [9].
Likewise, in the present study double staining of α-tubulin
with NuMA or γ-tubulin confirmed that all spindles
in paclitaxel-induced multipolar spindles contained
NuMA but did not all contain γ-tubulin, indicating that
enhanced multipolar spindle formation due to combination
drug treatment occurred independent of centrosome
amplification. Future studies exploring the mechanism by
which paclitaxel induces formation of multipolar mitotic
spindles will potentially elucidate additional mechanisms
of this drug combination.
HDAC inhibitors impact a wide range of biological
functions through modulation of multiple signaling
pathways, including regulating expression of genes critical
for cell cycle progression, remodeling chromatin by
increasing acetylation of histones, and directly acetylating
proteins that control cell cycle progression [18]. In some
cases, high concentrations of HDAC inhibitors induced
hyperacetylation of histones and triggered G2/M arrest
[36, 37]. The dose level of ACY-241 used here did not
significantly increase M phase arrest either as a single
agent or in combination with paclitaxel (Supplementary
Figures S2, S5 and Supplementary Video S1) despite
demonstrating pharmacological inhibition of both
HDAC6 and Class I HDACs (Figure 1B). Several studies
previously demonstrated that inhibition of HDACs
effectively disrupts SAC function and caused mitotic
delay of 2–3 hours, but did not induce stable mitotic arrest
(> 10 hour) in combination with either taxol or nocodazole
treatment [38–41]. This observation is in line with the
results described here (Supplementary Figures S2 and S5),
where combination treatment with ACY-241 did reduce
cell cycle progression but without evidence of prolonged
M phase accumulation. These findings suggest that the
observed aberrant mitotic figures may eventually bypass
the SAC and progress through mitosis, as was observed

DISCUSSION
Paclitaxel is a widely used standard of care agent for
the treatment of solid tumors, though incomplete clinical
responses are commonly seen. There is thus a need for
enhanced therapeutic activity in the form of novel drugs
that are well tolerated in combination with paclitaxel.
ACY-241 is a novel orally available selective HDAC6
inhibitor under clinical development in combination with
pomalidomide and dexamethasone in multiple myeloma
(NCT 02400242). In this study, ACY-241 treatment in
combination with paclitaxel increased the frequency of
multipolar spindle formation during mitosis, which was
associated with aberrant mitosis and altered DNA content.
Combination treatment with ACY-241 further suppressed
cancer cell proliferation and increased cell death relative
to either single agent, and significantly suppressed tumor
growth in solid tumor xenograft models.
Paclitaxel is commonly accepted to enhance
microtubule polymerization and reduce microtubule
dynamic instability [12, 16]. In the absence of dynamic
instability microtubules are no longer able to correctly
attach to kinetochores, resulting in unattached kinetochores
which then activate the spindle assembly checkpoint
(SAC), a signal transduction cascade that arrests mitotic

via live-cell time-lapse imaging, thus resulting in cell
death or daughter cells with abnormal DNA content and/
or nuclear morphology.
There are multiple potential mechanisms by which
inhibition of various HDAC isozymes could cooperate
with paclitaxel to disrupt mitotic spindle formation. Similar
to prior studies with non-selective pan-HDAC inhibitors
that inhibit HDAC6 as well as other HDACs, ACY-241
in combination with paclitaxel significantly increases
acetylation of α-tubulin [25, 29]. Hyperacetylation of
α-tubulin due to HDAC6 inhibition has been shown to
reduce microtubule dynamic instability [13], suggesting the

ACY-241/paclitaxel combination may act to further suppress
microtubule dynamic instability. Indeed, it was shown that
the non-selective pan-HDAC inhibitor Trichostatin A has
cooperative effects with paclitaxel on both apoptosis and
microtubule instability in papillary serous endometrial
cancer cells [42]. Beyond potentially impacting
microtubule stability, HDAC6 inhibition could also impact
mitotic spindle formation due to its known effects on the
microtubule motor protein dynein, where the HDAC6/
dynein complex regulates the transport of ubiquitinated
proteins along microtubules towards aggresomes [43].
Interestingly, dynein also plays an important role during

HDAC enzymatic assays

spindle assembly and spindle pole formation as depletion of
dynein led to unfocused microtubules at spindle poles and
poor centrosomal attachment, resulting in multipolar spindle
formation [44]. Beyond HDAC6, several previous studies
showed that inhibition of Class I HDACs could weaken
SAC function through increasing acetylation of histones
followed by dis-localization of chromosomal passenger
complex (CPC) proteins, potentially impairing microtubule
attachment to the centromere [39, 40, 45]. SAC activation
can suppress multipolar mitoses by providing additional
time for appropriate formation of bipolar mitotic spindles
[46]. Thus, it is possible that HDAC inhibitors may weaken
SAC activation therefore reducing the role of the SAC in
suppressing spindle multipolarity, resulting in indirect
enhancement of multipolar spindle formation. Future
studies could explore the contribution(s) of individual
HDAC isozymes to the observed combination efficacy with
paclitaxel.
Both HDAC inhibition and paclitaxel treatment
impact diverse cellular pathways in both interphase and
mitosis to interrupt the growth and proliferation of cancer
cells. The findings presented here identify an enhancement
of abnormal cell division from combination treatment
with paclitaxel and the selective HDAC inhibitor ACY241, though additional mechanisms likely also contribute
to the observed anti-cancer activity in cellular and animal
models of various solid tumor types. For example, though
not tested in this study, combination treatment may also
mechanistically interact to directly reduce progression
from G1 to S phase. Together, these findings supported
the initiation of an ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial
(NCT02551185) to evaluate the safety and preliminary
efficacy of ACY-241 in combination with paclitaxel in
patients with advanced solid tumors.

ACY-241 was dissolved and subsequently diluted
in assay buffer [50 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl,
0.001% Tween-20, 0.05% BSA, and 20 μM tris(2carboxyethyl)phosphine] to 6-fold the final concentration.
HDAC enzymes were diluted to 1.5-fold of the final
concentration in assay buffer and pre-incubated with
ACY-241 for 10 min before the addition of the substrate.
The amount of FTS (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and
HDAC6) or MAZ-1675 (HDAC4, HDAC5, HDAC7,
HDAC8, and HDAC9) used for each enzyme was equal to
the Michaelis constant (Km), as determined by a titration
curve. FTS or MAZ-1675 was diluted in assay buffer to
6-fold the final concentration with 0.3 M sequencing grade
trypsin (Sigma). The substrate/trypsin mix was added to
the enzyme/compound mix and the plate was shaken for
60 sec and then placed into a SpectraMax M5 microtiter
plate reader. The enzymatic reaction was monitored for
release of 7-amino-4-methoxy-coumarin over 30 min,
after deacetylation of the lysine side chain in the peptide
substrate, and the linear rate of the reaction was calculated.

Animal studies
All animal studies were performed in female
athymic nude mice (Crl:NU(NCr)-Foxn1nu) housed
in appropriate animal care facilities during the
experimental period at an Association for Assessment
and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
International (AAALAC) certified facility at Charles
River Discovery Services (Morrisville, NC). All
procedures complied with the recommendations of
the Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Xenografts were initiated by subcutaneously injecting
100 µL of cell suspensions, equivalent to 1 × 107 cells
for TOV-21G tumor cell lines, into the right flank of
7-week-old mice. Tumors for all mice were allowed
to grow until a volume of 100 to 150 mm3 before
randomization (cohort sizes n ≥ 7) and treatment
initiation. Ricolinostat and ACY-241 were dosed via
intraperitoneal injection at 50 mg/kg once daily for five
days, followed by two days off, for three consecutive
weeks (50 mg/kg IP QD 5/2 × 3wk), while paclitaxel
was dosed via intraperitoneal injection at 10 mg/kg once
daily for five consecutive days (10 mg/kg IP QD × 5)
or intravenously at 10 mg/kg every other day for a
total of five doses (10 mg/kg IV QOD × 5). Tumor
volumes and body weights were measured twice weekly
throughout the duration of the experiment and tumor
growth inhibition (TGI) was assessed at the end of the
third cycle of therapy. Differences in tumor volume are
indicated by p values obtained by performing a oneway ANOVA at the final tumor measurement time point,
followed by a Tukey multiple hypothesis correction.

Cell cycle assessment

The growth inhibitory effect of single agent
ACY-241 or paclitaxel was assessed by measuring
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl
)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS; CellTiter 96®
AQueous One Solution; Promega; Madison, WI, USA)
dye absorbance. Cells (A2780, TOV-21G, MDA-MB-231)
from 72 hour cultures were pulsed with 5 μL of CellTiter
96® AQueous One Solution in each well. The 384-well
plates were incubated at 37°C for 5 hours, and absorbance
was read in triplicate at a wavelength of 490 nm (with
background correction using readings at 650 nm) on a
spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp.; Sunnyvale,
CA, USA). The mean and standard deviation were then
calculated.
The inhibitory effect of the drug combination on
cell proliferation was assessed by crystal violet staining.
Briefly, cells were seeded in replicate 12-well plates at
5,000 (MiaPaCa-2 and TOV-21G) or 20,000 (T47D)
cells per well, allowed to attach overnight, and then
treated with the indicated concentrations of ACY-241
and/or paclitaxel for up to 9 days. On each of days 0,
5, 7, and 9, the culture medium was removed from one
plate, the cells were washed with Phosphate Buffered
Saline (PBS), fixed with 4% w/v paraformaldehyde
at room temperature for 10 min, and then stained with
0.05% w/v crystal violet (Sigma) for 15 min. The cells
were then washed with water, after which the water was
removed and the plates were dried at room temperature.
After collection of samples from all time points, the
crystal violet was extracted in 10% v/v acetic acid, and
absorbance was read in triplicate at a wavelength of 540
nm on a spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices Corp.;
Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The mean and standard deviation
were then calculated.

Cells cultured in the presence of ACY-241 and/or
paclitaxel were incubated for 60 min in the presence of
10 µM 5-ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) at 37oC. After
EdU incorporation, cells were washed and resuspended
in fixative solution using the Click-iT® EdU Alexa Fluor®
488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Life Technologies, Grand
Island, NY). Cellular DNA was stained using FxCycle™
Far Red Stain (Life Technologies) and cells analyzed
on an Attune NxT Flow cytometer (ThermoFisher
Scientific) or Cytomics FC 500 MPL flow cytometer
(Beckman Coulter; Indianapolis, IN). Flow cytometry
data were analyzed using FlowJo software (TreeStar;
Ashland, OR). Dual-parameter plots were generated for
Alexa Fluor® 488–labeled EdU fluorescence (indicating
newly synthesized DNA) and FxCycle™ Far Red Stain
fluorescence (indicating relative DNA content). The
generated plots have a typical inverted U-shaped pattern
that identifies proliferating cells with bright EdU staining
and nonproliferating cells with dim EdU staining that are
either in G1 phase (with 2N DNA content) or in G2/M
phase (with 4N DNA content). Cell death is indicated
by the subG1 population, which are the nonproliferating
cells with dim EdU staining and low DNA content
(< 2N; corresponding to the lower left corner of the dualparameter plot).

Immunoblotting
Cells cultured in the presence of ACY-241 and/
or paclitaxel were washed and lysed using radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) lysis buffer containing
5 mM NaF, 2 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM PMSF and complete
protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific). Lysates
were sonicated 2 to 3 times for 30 sec in medium
(Diagenode, Bioruptor 300).
For western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein
were loaded and size separated on Bolt™ 4 to 12% BisTris Plus Gels. Proteins were subsequently transferred
onto polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane
using an iBlot® 2 Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen).
Immunoblotting was carried out according to standard
protocols with antibodies against histone H3 acetyllysine 56 (abcam), histone-H4, pantropic (Millipore),
acetyl-α-tubulin (Sigma); and β-Actin (Sigma). Antigenantibody complexes were detected using secondary
antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxide (HRP)
and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (GE
Healthcare; Piscataway, NJ).
For WES analysis, lysates were separated by
an automated capillary-based electrophoresis system
(WES, ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA). All procedures
were performed according to the manufacturer’s
recommendations using the supplied reagents. Briefly,

IncuCyte® proliferation and apoptosis assay
Proliferation and Caspase 3/7 activation apoptosis
assays were performed at Essen Bioscience (Ann Arbor,
MI, USA). NucLight Red expressing MDA-MB-231
cells were plated at 2,500 cells/well in 96-well plates for
24 hours prior to treating with DMSO, ACY-241, and/
or paclitaxel. Caspase 3/7 reagent was added (time = 0)
and cells were imaged every 2 hours for 96 hours in an
IncuCyte® Zoom Live Cell Analysis system at 37°C in 5%
CO2. Proliferation was assessed through absolute count
of NucLight Red labeled cells over time while activation
of apoptosis was assessed through total Caspase 3/7
positive objects over time. Each condition was performed
in triplicate. Kinetic trace graphs of NucLight Red
Proliferation and Caspase 3/7 apoptosis were generated
by plotting the mean with SEM at each time point in Prism
(Graphpad, La Jolla, CA, USA).

Immunofluorescence
Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, followed by
permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for
5 min. The cells were then incubated with α-tubulin
(DM1A) mouse monoclonal antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology, Danvers, MA), γ-tubulin (GTU-88) mouse
monoclonal antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) or
NuMA (GT3611) mouse monoclonal antibody (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL) followed by Alexa Fluor 488
or 546 conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA). Images were obtained with a Zeiss AX10
microscope (Carl Zeiss Micro-Imaging, Inc., Jena,
Germany) equipped with a 20 X, 40X, or 63 X objective
and standard filter set.

Live cell imaging
Time-lapse imaging was obtained on a Zeiss AX10
live-cell microscope coupled with a CO2 and temperaturemaintenance system, and a time-lapse recording system
supporting multi-location time series acquisition
(SlideBook6 x64, Intelligent Imaging Innovations, Inc.,
Ringsby, CT). After staining with 10 nM Hoechst33342,
TOV-21G cells were incubated in 10% CO2 at 37oC
and time-lapse images were acquired at 2 min intervals
up to 48 hours with a CoolSNAP HQ2 CCD camera
(Photometrics, Tucson, AZ).

Statistical analysis
All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate
and repeated at least 3 times unless indicated otherwise.
The statistical significance of differences was determined
using a one-way ANOVA test with post-hoc Tukey
multiple comparison correction. All statistical analyses
were performed using Prism v6.4 software (GraphPad).
