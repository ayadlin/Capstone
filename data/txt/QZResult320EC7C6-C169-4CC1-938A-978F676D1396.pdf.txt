Abstract
ATR is an attractive target in cancer therapy because it signals replication stress
and DNA lesions for repair and to S/G2 checkpoints. Cancer-specific defects in the
DNA damage response (DDR) may render cancer cells vulnerable to ATR inhibition
alone. We determined the cytotoxicity of the ATR inhibitor VE-821 in isogenically
matched cells with DDR imbalance. Cell cycle arrest, DNA damage accumulation and
repair were determined following VE-821 exposure.
Defects in homologous recombination repair (HRR: ATM, BRCA2 and XRCC3)
and base excision repair (BER: XRCC1) conferred sensitivity to VE-821. Surprisingly,
the loss of different components of the trimeric non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
protein DNA-PK had opposing effects. Loss of the DNA-binding component, Ku80,
caused hypersensitivity to VE-821, but loss of its partner catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs,
did not. Unexpectedly, VE-821 was particularly cytotoxic to human and hamster cells
expressing high levels of DNA-PKcs. High DNA-PKcs was associated with replicative
stress and activation of the DDR. VE-821 suppressed HRR, determined by RAD51 focus
formation, to a greater extent in cells with high DNA-PKcs.
Defects in HRR and BER and high DNA-PKcs expression, that are common in
cancer, confer sensitivity to ATR inhibitor monotherapy and may be developed as
predictive biomarkers for personalised medicine.

Introduction

in response to these lesions [2]. ATR is arguably the most
versatile of these three PIKKs because it is activated
by regions of single-stranded DNA that occur during
nucleotide excision repair, following resection of DNA
DSBs and, lesions most critical to replicating cells,
collapsed replication forks. Activated ATR phosphorylates
a number of targets involved in homologous recombination
DNA repair (HRR) and the re-start of replication forks but
its major target is CHK1 (reviewed in Chen et al. [3]).
By phosphorylation of CHK1, ATR initiates the S and G2
checkpoint cascade.
Aberrations in the DDR create the genomic
instability that is an “enabling characteristic” of cancer [4].
Cancer cells commonly have dysregulated G1 cell cycle
arrest, e.g. due to inactivation of the TP53/RB pathway [5],

The DNA damage response (DDR) is essential to
maintain genomic stability in the face of the high rate
of ongoing insult from environmental and endogenous
sources of DNA damage [1]. The DDR signals DNA
damage for repair, and to cell cycle checkpoints that
arrest the cell cycle while repair is being completed.
The response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and
collapsed replication forks is particularly crucial as these
types of damage are difficult to repair. Three PI3-Kinaserelated kinases (PIKKs) ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
mutated), ATR (ATM and Rad3 related) and DNA-PKcs
(DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit) recruit
DNA repair proteins and activate cell cycle checkpoints

and rely on their S/G2 checkpoints for survival following
DNA damage. Exploiting this dependence makes the ATR/
CHK1 axis an attractive target to selectively enhance the
anti-cancer activity of DNA damaging chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. CHK1 inhibitors, and more recently ATR
inhibitors attenuate/abrogate cell cycle arrest and increase
the cytotoxicity of the major classes of DNA damaging
anticancer agents preclinically (reviewed in [3]). CHK1
inhibitors are yet to fulfil their pre-clinical promise
in clinical trials, possibly because of poor selectivity
resulting in toxicity in combination (reviewed in [3]).
Preclinically ATR inhibition has somewhat different
effects from CHK1 inhibition [6] and if inhibitors could be
used as single agents toxicities are expected to be minimal
[7]. Two ATR inhibitors, VX-970 and AZD-6738, are
currently undergoing clinical evaluation. VX-970 is being
evaluated both as a single agent and in combination with
platinum or gemcitabine chemotherapy (clinicaltrials.gov
identifier: NCT02157792) and AZD-6738 in combination
with ionising radiation and carboplatin (EudraCT
identifier: 2013-005100-34 and clinicaltrials.gov identifier:
NCT02223923 and NCT02264678).
Exploitation of the dysregulation of the DDR
by synthetic lethality through the single-agent use of
inhibitors of other DDR components, exemplified by the
cytotoxicity of PARP inhibitors in HRR-defective tumours
[8] is an exciting new paradigm in cancer that led to a
rapid expansion in PARP inhibitor development. This has
driven the search for other synthetic lethal interactions
that could be exploited therapeutically. Recent studies
with the prototype ATR inhibitor, NU6027, demonstrated
that it was particularly cytotoxic to cells defective in BER
(XRCC1 mutant), and synergistic with PARP inhibition
[9, 10]. ATM and ERCC1-XPF defects are also reported
to render cells more sensitive to ATR inhibition [11]. We
therefore sought to identify DDR defects synthetically
lethal with the ATR inhibitor, VE-821 (the pre-clinical
lead from which VX-970 was developed), as a single
agent and to explore the underlying mechanism.
We confirm that cells lacking ATM or the BER
scaffold protein, XRCC1, are hypersensitive to ATR
inhibitor-induced cytotoxicity and identify for the first
time that defects in HRR components, XRCC3 or BRCA2,
also confer sensitivity to ATR inhibition. Interestingly,
while loss of the binding partner of DNA-PKcs, XRCC5
(Ku80), conferred sensitivity to VE-821, loss of DNAPKcs itself conferred resistance and over-expression of
DNA-PKcs conferred sensitivity. Mechanistic studies
suggest this is due to increased replicative stress and
attenuation of HRR function.

VE-821-induced cytotoxicity in DNA repair
defective Chinese hamster cells
In previous studies with VE-821 the greatest
chemosensitisation was observed in cells lacking ATM [7]
and VE-821 was synthetically lethal in cells depleted of
ATM [12]. We show here that V-E5 cells lacking ATM
are the most sensitive to VE-821 alone with only 1%
surviving exposure to 30 µM VE-821 compared to 38%
in the parental V79 Chinese hamster lung cells (p = 0.01)
(Figure 1A, Table 1). V-C8 cells that are HRR defective,
by virtue of a BRCA2 mutation, were almost as sensitive
(8% survival p = 0.04). Restoring BRCA2 function
through transfection of wt BRCA2 (V-C8 B2) or through
a reversing mutation (V-C8 PiR) resulted in reduced
sensitivity to VE-821.
Chinese hamster ovary AA8 cells were intrinsically
resistant to single agent VE-821 with 30 µM having
virtually no impact on viability (Figure 1B). This was not
due to a failure of ATR inhibition because VE-821 reduced
pChk1s345 to a similar or greater extent in AA8 cell lines
compared to V79 cells and M059J cells (Supplementary
Figure S1). EM9 cells lacking BER function due to
XRCC1 loss were significantly (p < 0.0001) more
sensitive to VE-821 with 30 µM killing approximately
75% (Table 1). The HRR-defective Irs1SF (XRCC3
mutant) were the most sensitive of the AA8 derivatives
with only 16% surviving exposure to 30 µM VE-821. The
UV5 cells that are nucleotide excision repair defective due
to ERCC2 mutation were also significantly (p = 0.0002)
more sensitive than the parental cells, but were the least
sensitive of all the repair-defective CHO cells. Most
curious was the data with non-homologous end joining
(NHEJ) defective cells. Ku70 and Ku80 bind DNA DSB
and recruit DNA-PKcs to form the catalytically active
holoenzyme to promote DSB repair. Ku80-defective xrs6
cells showed sensitivity comparable with HRR and BER
defective cells but, surprisingly, the V3 cells, defective in
DNA-PKcs, were not hypersensitive to VE-821 (Figure
1B, Table1). Correction of the DNA-PKcs defect by
transfection of a YAC containing human DNA-PKcs
rendered the cells (V3-YAC) significantly (p < 0.0001)
more sensitive to VE-821 (only 40% survival at 30 µM).

VE-821-induced cytotoxicity in human cells with
high levels of DNA-PKcs
Because of the unexpected results with the Chinese
hamster DNA-PKcs proficient and deficient cells we
investigated the phenomenon further in human malignant
glioblastoma cells deficient in DNA-PKcs, M059J, and the
DNA-PKcs overexpressing M059J-Fus-1 cells (hereafter

called Fus-1 cells for simplicity) (Figure 1C). Fus-1 cells
were substantially and significantly (p < 0.0001) more
sensitive to VE-821 with only 16% surviving treatment
with 10 µM in comparison with the DNA-PK defective
M059J cells with 67% survival. To determine if DNAPKcs kinase activity was responsible we used NU7441,
a potent and specific DNA-PK inhibitor [13], at a
concentration of 1 µM (as previously used for chemo- and
radiosensitisation and approximately 5x the cellular IC50
[14]). Co-exposure of the M059J Fus-1 cells to NU7441
did not protect from VE-821 cytotoxicity, in fact it
increased cell kill (10% survival at 10 µM VE-821; Table
1; Figure 1C). This was not due to an off-target effect
because NU7441 failed to sensitise M059J cells to VE821 (Supplementary Figure S3) Further investigations in
human ovarian OSEC2 cells (selected because of a high
intrinsic level of DNA-PKcs with an efficient knockdown:
A McCormick, unpublished data) revealed that 91%
DNA-PKcs knockdown resulted in significant protection
from VE-821 cytotoxicity (Figure 1D, Table 1). Thus, a
consistent pattern of greater sensitivity of high DNA-PKcs
expressing cells to VE-821 was seen in 3 independent
cell line pairs. Differences in sensitivity to VE-821 were
unlikely to be due to different ATR expression levels
since ATR levels were equivalent or slightly higher in

OSEC2 shDNA-PKcs cells (Figure 1D insert), but lower
in the DNA-PKcs deficient M059J cells (Figure 1C insert)
when normalised to actin loading control compared to
their DNA-PKcs expressing counterparts. The greater
sensitivity of the DNA-PKcs expressing cells was also
not due to greater inhibition of ATR activity by VE-821
asVE-821 (10 µM) inhibited CHK1Ser345 phosphorylation
to a similar extent in both M059J and Fus-1 cells
(Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). These data suggest
that the abundance of DNA-PKCS protein, independent
of its kinase activity, sensitises cells to VE-821-induced
cytotoxicity.
Interestingly, mining of publically-available data
suggests that the expression of ATR (ATR) and DNA-PKcs
(PRKDC) may be tandemly regulated in certain tumours.
For example, the expression of ATR and PRKDC are
similarly elevated across diverse glioblastoma subtypes
compared to normal brain (Figure 2A and 2B) and their
expression is strongly correlated (Figure 2C).

cMYC protein levels depend on DNA-PKcs

1 cells contain 7 or 8 copies of chromosome 8 following
transfection to correct their DNA-PKCS defect (encoded
by PRKDC located at 8q11.21) [16] we assessed levels
of cMYC (also located on chromosome 8 at 8q24.21) in
both M059J and Fus-1 cells. Despite containing 3 or 4
copies of chromosome 8 [17] M059J cells expressed only
low levels of cMYC whereas Fus-1 cells expressed much
higher cMYC levels (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure

S4). DNA-PKcs may be necessary to stabilise cMYC
[18] so we determined cMYC levels in OSEC2 cells
with (shDNA-PK) and without (shOT) silenced DNAPKcs (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure S4) and again
cMYC levels were lower in cells with reduced DNA-PKcs
expression. Therefore the higher levels of cMYC in the
Fus1 cells and OSEC2 cells could have affected VE821
sensitivity.

levels of DNA-PKcs endogenous DNA damage (e.g. ROS-induced SS breaks) that cause stalling of the replication fork signal successfully
to ATR to promote HRR and cell cycle arrest, ATR inhibition hampers this process but not sufficiently to seriously impact on cell viability.
However, in cells expressing high levels of DNA-PKcs, this may compete with ATR signalling resulting in reduced HRR, if cells are
also exposed to a DNA-PK inhibitor this will inhibit autophosphorylation and dissociation so may trap DNA-PKcs on the DNA. The
postulated attenuation of signalling to HRR via DNA-PKcs obstruction combined with ATR inhibition may be the mechanism underlying
the significantly compromised cell viability.

Significance is given for the effect of VE-821 by comparison with control or contemporaneously irradiated cells in
the absence of VE-821
To determine whether DNA-PK activity was
required to maintain high cMYC levels we investigated
the effect of NU7441 (1 µM to allow direct comparison
with the cytotoxicity data) on cMYC levels in Fus-1 cells.
cMYC is reported to have a short half-life of 20-30 min
[19]. In our study the levels of cMYC declined less rapidly
in Fus-1 cells with an estimated half-life of approximately
2 hours, suggesting some stabilisation. In NU7441-treated
cells the decline was more rapid and cMYC levels were
reduced to 50% of the initial level at 30 min (Figure 3B).
Since NU7441 impaired cMYC stability (Figure 3B) but
did not protect from VE-821 cytotoxicity, sensitivity to
VE-821 may not be due to elevated cMYC. To test this
hypothesis further we used immortalised human breast
cells, MCF10A and a MYC-amplified derivative (cMYCMCF10A) with an approximately 3-fold higher level
of cMYC expression. In cytotoxicity assays the MYCamplified cells were more resistant rather than more
sensitive to VE-821 compared to parental cells (Figure
3C; p < 0.0001). Taken together these data suggest that
sensitivity to VE-821 is not due to elevated cMYC.

1 cells than M059J cells (Table 2), indicative of higher
levels of replicative stress.
We previously showed that the ATR inhibitor
NU6027 suppressed RAD51 focus formation, indicating
that ATR inhibition led to an impairment of HRR [9]. To
determine if VE-821 also suppressed HRR and to assess
the impact of DNA-PKcs on HRR we measured γH2AX
and RAD51 foci in M059J and Fus-1 cells exposed to 2
Gy ionising radiation (IR) in the presence or absence of
VE-821 (Figure 4). IR was selected as the DNA damaging
agent because a) it is effective and commonly used in
cancer therapy, b) it reliably induces G2 accumulation in
M059J and Fus-1 cells allowing direct comparison with
the cell cycle data and c) published data indicates 1 μM
VE-821 is a potent radiosensitiser [25] Interpretation of
γH2AX data (Figure 4A) is somewhat complicated by the
fact that DNA-PKcs is the major kinase responsible for
H2AX phosphorylation immediately after IR. Previous
work in our lab indicates that NHEJ is responsible for the
immediate rapid DSB repair phase after IR and that the
kinetics of resolution of γH2AX foci closely follows that
of the resolution of DSB by neutral comet assay [20]. We
selected 6 and 24 hr as suitable time-points to measure
γH2AX foci as at these time-points they closely reflect
DSB measurements. As such, the lower levels of γH2AX
foci in Fus-1 cells at 6 and 24 hr may reflect the more
rapid repair, resulting in faster disappearance of γH2AX
foci. VE-821 caused a reduction in γH2AX foci at 24
hr, which may reflect an impairment of ATR-mediated
phosphorylation of H2AX as IR-induced SS breaks
encounter the replication forks.
Interestingly, VE-821 alone significantly suppressed
RAD51 focus formation in unirradiated DNA-PKcs
proficient and deficient cells, but the suppression was more
profound in Fus-1 cells than in the M059J cells (Figure
4B, Table 3) suggesting VE-821 impairs HRR-mediated
repair of endogenous DNA damage/replication stress to
a greater extent in DNA-PKcs overexpressing cells. There
were >3x more RAD51 foci in M059J cells than in Fus-1
cells (p < 0.0001) 24 hr after IR, potentially indicating

VE-821 impairs HRR in irradiated DNA-PKcs
overexpressing cells
We next investigated if the preferential cytotoxicity
of VE-821 in cells with high DNA-PKcs levels was due
to an effect on DNA repair. DNA is continuously being
damaged at an astonishingly high level (>105 SSBs/
genome/cell/day) largely caused by reactive oxygen
species that are a by-product of respiration. In replicating
cells, any remaining un-repaired DNA breaks will cause
replicative stress, collapsed replication forks and singleended DNA DSBs. Such lesions activate ATR, trigger
phosphorylation of H2AX, visualised by γH2AX foci, and
are resolved by HRR, visualised by RAD51 foci. Although
low in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, γH2AX
foci were modestly (27%, p = 0.059) higher and RAD51
foci were significantly (67%, p = 0.002) higher in Fuswww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that DNA-PKcs suppresses HRR or that DNA breaks had
been repaired by the NHEJ pathway. DNA-PKcs may
also suppress ATR activity as the phosphorylation of
CHK1 after IR and gemcitabine was lower in Fus-1 than
M059J cells (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2). VE-821
significantly (p < 0.0001) reduced RAD51 focus formation
24 hr post-IR in both cell lines, and, as in the absence
of exogenous damage, a more profound suppression was
observed in the Fus-1 cells (3.3-fold) than in the M059J
cells (2.4-fold). Cumulatively, these data suggest that VE821 suppresses HRR to a greater extent in DNA-PKcs
proficient Fus-1 cells, consistent with DNA-PKCS proficient
cells being more sensitive to VE-821-induced cytotoxicity.

therapeutic manoeuvre.
The hypersensitivity of ATM-defective cells was
also not unexpected because VE-821 had previously been
shown to be cytotoxic to cells in which ATM had been
knocked down [11]. Moreover, recent data, reported in
abstract form only, indicate that the ATR inhibitor AZD6738 was synthetically lethal in ATM-defective CLL cells
from patients [12]. ATM is thought to contribute to HRR
[24] and we found that other HRR defects also conferred
sensitivity: Irs1SF cells defective in XRCC3 (a RAD51
related protein) were the most sensitive to VE-821 and
BRCA2-mutant cells showed a similar level of sensitivity
to the ATM mutants. Thus, although ATR inhibitors are
thought to principally modulate HRR, synthetic lethality
can be achieved in cells that already have defects in
components of HRR, indicating that epistasis is not an
issue. This is consistent with the observation that defects
in the ATR signalling pathway conferred substantial
synthetic lethality with ATR and CHK1 inhibitors and
analogous to recent data showing that XRCC1-/- cells
are hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors [25]. These data
suggest that ATR inhibitors may have activity in several
tumour types because HRR defects are common in cancer,
not just those associated with BRCA1/2 mutations [26].
The potential could be very broad indeed as hypoxia, a
common occurrence in tumours that promotes a more
aggressive phenotype, actually causes a downregulation of
HRR proteins that is exploitable by “contextual synthetic
lethality” [2]. Indeed, this may underlie the cytotoxicity
and radiosensitisation by VE-821 in hypoxic cells [27].
In contrast to reports that ERCC1, a nuclease in the
NER pathway was synthetically lethal with ATR inhibition
[11], dysfunction of ERCC2 (XPD), a helicase upstream
of ERCC1 in the NER pathway, only conferred a modest
sensitivity to VE-821. ERCC1 also participates in multiple
DNA repair pathways, including cross-link repair and
HRR [28] that may contribute to the sensitivity to VE821.Therefore, not all DDR defects confer substantial
sensitivity to ATR inhibitors.
Our most surprising observation was that cells
defective in DNA-PKcs were not sensitive to VE-821
but VE-821 was profoundly cytotoxic to cells that overexpressed DNA-PKcs. The initial observation in CHO
cells was confirmed in two isogenic pairs of human cancer
cell lines. The kinase function of DNA-PKcs was not
responsible because co-exposure to the DNA-PK inhibitor,
NU7441 increased, rather than decreased, sensitivity
to VE-821. Similarly, the Ku80-defective cells were
sensitive rather than resistant to VE-821 suggesting that
NHEJ function was not responsible. However, it should be
noted that Ku80 has other functions besides NHEJ, such as
telomere maintenance [29, 30] a possible role in BER [31]
and it has been implicated in HRR through its interaction
with BRCA1 [32]. Since both BER and HRR defects
confer sensitivity to VE-821 the sensitivity of Ku80
defective cells may reflect these alternative functions.

VE-821 abrogates G2 arrest in both M059J and
Fus-1 cells
We next sought to determine if the greater
cytotoxicity of VE-821 in the DNA-PKcs expressing cells
was due to a differential effect on cell cycle distribution.
In parallel experiments to those measuring HRR, IR
caused G2 accumulation, which was almost completely
abrogated by 1 μM VE-821 in both cell lines, consistent
with its inhibition of ATR signalling to the G2 checkpoint
(Figure 4C) as shown previously in other cell lines [21].

Discussion
Clinical studies with molecularly targeted agents
show that stratification of patients based on the molecular
pathology of their tumour is critical for success [22]. ATR
has emerged as an interesting novel target and two ATR
inhibitors are being tested clinically. The aim of the work
presented here was to identify molecular determinants
of sensitivity to ATR inhibitors for patient stratification.
Since dysregulation of the DNA damage response (DDR)
is common in cancer, and there is precedent for DDR
defects to confer sensitivity to DDR inhibitors (HRR
defects and PARP inhibitors)), we focussed on DDR
defects as potential determinants of sensitivity to single
agent ATR inhibition.
BER and HRR are complementary pathways in the
repair of endogenous DNA damage. It is clear that VE-821
impairs HRR since it causes a profound suppression of
RAD51 focus formation after IR (Figure 4B). By analogy
with the synthetic lethality of PARPi (which suppresses
BER) in HRR-defective cells, the reciprocal synthetic
lethality is also predicted, where inhibition of HRR by
VE-821 is synthetically lethal with defects in BER as
indicated by the hypersensitivity of the BER-defective
EM9 cells confirming our previous results with another
ATR inhibitor, NU6027 [9]. BER defects have been
reported widely in a variety of cancer types (reviewed
in [23]) and selection of patients based on tumour BER
status for ATR inhibitor monotherapy may be a useful

Overexpression of cMYC has previously been
shown to cause replicative stress and confer sensitivity
to CHK1 inhibitors and ATR knockdown [15, 33].
Since correction of the DNA-PKcs defect in Fus-1 cells
involves amplifying chromosome 8 and that the cMYC
gene is also on chromosome 8 we investigated if cMYC
was implicated in the VE-821-sensitivity of DNA-PKcs
over-expressing cells. Fus-1 cells did have significantly
higher levels of cMYC and γH2AX and RAD51 foci,
suggesting a higher level of replication stress (Figure
4A/B). However, when tested in another cell background,
without manipulation of DNA-PKCS, cMYC overexpressing cells were resistant rather than sensitive to
VE-821 indicating that it is the elevated DNA-PKcs
rather than cMYC that dictates VE-821 sensitivity. We
hypothesise that DNA-PKcs over-expression, which is
common in cancer [34], causes genomic instability by
competition with HRR and needs to be balanced by an
increase in ATR to allow the growth of the tumour. Indeed,
data mining confirms that, in gliomas at least, there is a
strong correlation between ATR and PRKDC transcripts.
The higher level of RAD51 foci in Fus-1 cells compared
to M059J cells was accompanied by a higher G2 fraction
that may also indicate increased replication stress and
dependence on G2 checkpoint signalling. VE-821 caused
a much greater reduction in RAD51 and slightly greater
reduction in the G2 fraction in untreated Fus-1 cells. This
suggests that in DNA-PKcs overexpressing cells VE-821
has a greater impact on HRR and checkpoint activation in
response to endogenous damage. Following exposure to
IR there was a greater increase in RAD51 foci in M059J
cells compared to Fus-1 cells, suggesting that HRR was
more active in DNA-PKcs defective cells. Remarkably,
VE-821 caused a greater suppression of RAD51 foci in
the Fus-1 cells, confirming its greater impact on HRR in
the DNA-PKcs expressing cells. Several studies suggest
that NHEJ competes with HRR in the response to DNA
DSBs (reviewed in [35]) and indeed the deletion of 53BP1
or DNA-PKcs can restore HRR function in BRCA mutant
cells [36]. Our data are largely in agreement with these
observations but suggest that different components of
NHEJ are more important for this competition than others.
Thus, Ku80 and the NHEJ pathway per se may not be
critical, but DNA-PKcs may hamper HRR. Since HRR is
a high fidelity pathway and specifically associated with
stalled replication forks (likely to be the most abundant
endogenous DS lesions) it is the pathway principally used
to maintain viability in the absence of exogenous DNA
damage. Indeed, whereas HRR is critical for genomic
stability, NHEJ, which is more error-prone, has been
implicated in promoting genomic instability and cancer
development [35].
In contrast to reports that DNA-PK inhibition (with
NU7441) also restored HRR function and resistance
to PARPi in BRCA mutant cells [36], we found that
NU7441 actually increased sensitivity to VE-821. DNAwww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

PKcs autophosphorylation is thought to be necessary
for its dissociation from DNA for the NHEJ pathway
to complete DSB repair. Based on our observations we
speculate that increased DNA-PKcs levels increases the
chance of binding to DNA DSB potentially obstructing the
recruitment of some components of the HRR machinery
(Figure 4D). We further speculate that this potential
impairment of HRR causes hypersensitivity to VE-821,
similar to that experienced by HRR defective cells. The
observation that NU7441 further sensitised Fus-1 cells to
VE-821 may suggest that inhibition of the kinase activity
could hinder DNA-PKcs dissociation and hence further
impair recruitment of the HRR machinery. This would
be analogous to PARP inhibitors which, by preventing
PARP-1 auto-ADP-ribosylation and dissociation from
DNA breaks, have a more profound effect on their repair
than does depletion of the enzyme [37]. Similarly, ATM
inhibition is more detrimental than ATM knockdown,
through inhibiting ATM dissociation from the DNA
thereby causing a physical impediment [8, 38]. Further
investigations would be necessary to determine the
therapeutic potential of DNA-PKcs and ATR inhibitor
combinations.
HRR defects due to BRCA mutations are already
known to confer sensitivity to both conventional cytotoxic
agents (especially cisplatin) and molecularly targeted
agents (PARPi). Our observations that BER defects and
high levels of DNA-PKcs confer sensitivity to ATR
inhibition are therefore novel and exciting. Whilst the
sensitivity of cells with these imbalances in the DDR to
ATR inhibition may not be quite as striking as reported
originally for BRCA mutations and PARP, they are
similar to our previous determination of sensitivities of
HRR-defective human cancer cells to PARP inhibition
[39] and other synthetic lethalities with ATM and ATR
inhibition [40] and reviewed in [41]). As stated above,
both BER defects and high NHEJ can be sufficient to
promote genomic instability leading to cancer formation.
Several cancers have defects in BER and/or overexpress
DNA-PKcs [23, 34]. Over-expression of DNA-PKcs
may be linked to disease progression, and our own data
indicate that this is the case in liver cancer [42]. The data
presented here indicate that BER defects and DNA-PKcs
overexpression are exploitable with the ATR inhibitor,
VE-821 and may prove to be predictive biomarkers for
personalised medicine with the ATR inhibitors that are in
clinical trials (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?te
rm=ATR+inhibitor&pg=1).
