ABSTRACT
Multidrug resistance in cancer cells arises from altered drug permeability of the
cell. We previously reported activation of the Wnt pathway in ABCB1-overexpressed
human uterus sarcoma drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cells through active β-catenin and
associated transactivation activities, and upregulation of Wnt-targeting genes. In this
study, Wnt5A was found to be significantly upregulated in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/
ADR2 cells, suggesting an important role for the Wnt5A signaling pathway in cancer
drug resistance. Higher cAMP response elements and Tcf/Lef transcription activities
were shown in the drug-resistant cancer cells. However, expression of Wnt target
genes and CRE activities were downregulated in Wnt5A shRNA stably-transfected
MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Cell viability of the drug-resistant cancer cells was also reduced
by doxorubicin treatment and Wnt5A shRNA transfection, or by Wnt5A depletion. The
in vitro data were supported by immunohistochemical analysis of 24 paired breast
cancer biopsies obtained pre- and post-chemotherapeutic treatment. Wnt5A, VEGF
and/or ABCB1 were significantly overexpressed after treatment, consistent with
clinical chemoresistance. Taken together, the Wnt5A signaling pathway was shown
to contribute to regulating the drug-resistance protein ABCB1 and β-catenin-related
genes in antagonizing the toxic effects of doxorubicin in the MDR cell lines and in
clinical breast cancer samples.

INTRODUCTION

cells. Herein, the non-canonical Wnt5A was upregulated
in two multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines, MES-SA/
Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells. The data indicated that
Wnt5A stabilized β-catenin in the nucleus through the
PKA pathway in both drug-resistant cells. Furthermore,
neutralization of Wnt5A inhibited growth of the drugresistant cells. Moreover, inhibition of Wnt5A by shRNA
led to resensitization of the cells to doxorubicin in
vitro and in vivo. Besides, Wnt5A expression level was
positively correlated with ABCB1 and VEGF expression
levels in the clinical breast cancer tissues. Taken together,
Wnt5A-controlled PKA/β-catenin signaling regulate
upregulation of ABCB1, cyclin D1, c-Myc and VEGF in
MDR cancer cells for increased survival advantage under
chemotherapeutic treatment.

Multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer is a condition
in which cancer cells become resistant to structurally
unrelated anticancer drugs [1]. Several mechanisms
have been reported to activate MDR in such cancers,
including reduced apoptosis, advanced DNA damage
repair mechanisms, altered drug metabolism, mutation or
over expression of the drug’s targets, drug inactivation,
or efflux of the drug from the cell [2]. P-glycoprotein
1 (permeability glycoprotein, abbreviated as P-gp or
Pgp), also known as multidrug resistance protein 1
(MDR1) or ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member
1 (ABCB1) or cluster of differentiation 243 (CD243), is
a glycoprotein that, in humans, is encoded by the ABCB1
gene. Overexpression of ABCB1 causes therapeutic drugs
to be pumped out of the cancer cells thus preventing
effective treatment. Since ABCB1 expression in normal
tissues leads to higher toxicity in cancer treatment using
an ABCB1 inhibitor [3], researchers have focused on the
molecular pathway of MDR cancer cells as a strategy in
the development of new molecular targets [4].
Wnt proteins are crucial signaling molecules which
are involved not only in physiological development [5],
decision of stem cell fate [6] but also in oncogenesis
[7] and cross-talk between signaling pathways [8, 9].
Canonical Wnt proteins such as Wnt3A stabilize β-catenin
in the nucleus through binding with the Frizzle proteins
of the cell membrane [10]. Furthermore, Wnt5A was a
well-discussed non-canonical Wnt protein that plays an
important role in many physiological processes, including
planar cell polarity (PCP) [11], Wnt calcium signaling
pathway [12], axon guidance [13], stem cell functions
[14], antagonization of canonical Wnt proteins [15], and
macrophage-induced malignant invasion [16]. Although
Wnt-5A is thought to have primarily functions in the
non-canonical pathway, it also has functions in β-catenin
stabilization [17].
Recent studies indicated that ABCB1 expression
was controlled by Wnt signaling in MDR cancer cells
[18]. Furthermore, Wnt signaling inhibition resensitizes
MDR cancer cells to chemotherapy drugs [19]. However,
these studies have been confined to canonical Wnt
protein-related signaling of drug resistant cancer cells.
Furthermore, our previous studies indicated that Wnttargeting genes, including c-Myc and cyclin D1, were
upregulated and were relevant in inhibiting the expression
of p21 in MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Moreover, we also found
that the canonical Wnt pathway was only activated in
ABCB1-overexpressed MES-SA/Dx5 cells through active
β-catenin and related transactivation activities regulating
the cell cycle [20].
Since little is known about the non-canonical Wnt
protein-related pathway in drug resistant cancer cells,
we have attempted in this study to investigate the role
of the non-canonical Wnt5A in drug-resistant cancer

RESULTS
Wnt signaling is activated in two multidrugresistant cancer cell lines
Since the Wnt pathway is correlated to ABCB1
expression level in multidrug resistant cells [18], the
ABCB1, β-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 protein levels
were evaluated in the parental uterus sarcoma MES-SA
and the breast cancer MCF7 cell lines in relation to their
drug resistant counterparts, MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/
ADR2, respectively. The data showed higher expression
levels of ABCB1, β-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 in
the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells
(Figure 1A). Furthermore, lower phosphorylation status of
β-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) and higher phosphorylation levels
of GSK3β (Ser9) were also detected in MES-SA/Dx5 and
MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 1A). Expression levels of the
Wnt genes were verified by quantitative RT-PCR. The data
indicated that Wnt2, Wnt5A and Wnt7A were upregulated
in MES-SA/Dx5 cells compared to MES-SA cells
(Supplementary Figure 1A). Interestingly, Wnt5A alone,
among other Wnt genes, showed significantly increased
levels in MES-SA/Dx5 (Supplementary Figure 1B). In
both cases, elevated TOP activities and higher Wnt5A
mRNA levels were concurrently detected in MES-SA/
Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figures 1B and C). The data
indicated that Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt5A were upregulated
in MDR cells. Wnt5A expression level was assessed by
western blot, which demonstrated that higher expression
levels of cellular Wnt5A and secreted Wnt5A in MES-SA/
Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure 1D). Furthermore,
higher expression levels of cellular Wnt5A and secreted
Wnt5A were also observed in the multidrug-resistant
KB-V1, NCI/ADR-RES and SW620-MDR1 cells of the
cervix, ovary and colon, respectively (Supplementary
Figure 2). These data indicated that elevated expression of
Wnt5A regulated the signaling pathway to support MDR

5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine-treated MES-SA cells, which
had lower methylation status, showed 11-fold increase
of Wnt5A mRNA expression level (Figure 2C and 2D).
These data indicated that aberrant hypomethylation of the
Wnt5A intron led to elevated Wnt5A expression levels in
MDR cancer cells.

Upregulation of Wnt5A was controlled by DNA
methylation in drug-resistant cell line
In order to determine whether there was aberrant
methylation of Wnt5A, we used COBRA assay to further
investigate the CpG island of the first intron of Wnt5A
(+494-+664) in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.
The COBRA assay results indicated lower methylation
status in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells (Figure
2A and 2B). To determine whether expression of Wnt5A
in MES-SA/Dx5 cells is regulated by DNA methylation of
the CpG island in the first intron of Wnt5A (+494-+664),
Wnt5A expression was examined in untreated and 2 µM
5-aza-2’-deoxycytidine–treated MES-SA cells. 5-aza-2’deoxycytidine was previously reported to inhibit DNMT1
and reduced DNA hypomethylation in a dose-dependent
manner [21]. Quantitative RT-PCR data indicated that

Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase A pathway
is upregulated in drug-resistant cells
Higher Wnt5A and β-catenin expression levels were
observed in drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/
ADR2 cells (Figure 1A and 1D). A previous report has
indicated that Wnt5A-activated Protein Kinase A pathway
leads to β-catenin accumulation in the nucleus via GSK3β
inactivation [22]. To verify possible Wnt5A pathway
activation resulting in β-catenin induction, we evaluated
the expression of cAMP-dependent protein kinase
catalytic subunit PRKACA, PRKACB and PRKACG

in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells. Quantitative
RT-PCR data showed that PRKACB expression was
significantly increased in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/
ADR2 cells (Figure 3A). It has previously been shown
that PKA is activated by increasing the transcription of
its catalytic subunit β, PRKACB [23]. These data led us
to hypothesize upregulation of cAMP/PKA activities in
drug-resistant cells. Previous data indicated that PKA
activation was followed by phosphorylation of cyclic AMP
response element (CRE)-binding proteins and subsequent
CRE activation, leading to expression of CRE-regulated
genes [24]. To evaluate the PKA activity, CRE reporter
assays were performed and the data indicated that CRE
expressed was upregulated in MES-SA/Dx5 and foskolintreated MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 3B). Furthermore,
higher cAMP levels were detected in MES-SA/Dx5 cells
(Supplementary Figure 3). After treating with increasing
dosages of the PKA inhibitor H-89 in MES-SA/Dx5 and
MCF7/ADR2, TOP reporter assays showed decreased
activities (Figure 3C) and western blot analysis showed
increases of phosphorylated β-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) and
GSK3β in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). On the
other hand, decreased levels of β-catenin, phosphorylated

GSK3β (Ser 9), c-Myc and cyclin D1 were also found
in H-89-treated MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3D). These data
indicated that upregulating PKA signaling was detected
and the β-catenin-related signaling was regulated by PKA
signaling in MDR cells.

Wnt5A regulates PKA and β-catenin activities in
the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 cell line
To confirm the regulatory role of Wnt5A on
β-catenin through PKA activity, a Wnt5A shRNA vector
was introduced into MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Western blot data
indicated that β-catenin, ABCB1, c-Myc and cyclin D1
were downregulated in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5
cells (Figure 4A). Likewise, Wnt5A secretion was also
decreased in these cells (Figure 4A). Besides, increases
in phosphorylated β-catenin (Thr41/Ser45) and decreased
levels of phosphorylated GSK3β (Ser 9) and β-catenin
were also detected Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells
(Figure 4B). Furthermore, CRE and TOP reporter assays
indicated that CRE and TOP activities were reduced in
MES-SA/Dx5 cells when Wnt5A was knocked down

ABCB1 expression and efflux ability are inhibited
in the Wnt5A-knockdown drug-resistant MESSA/Dx5 cell line

(Figures 4C and 4D). Since decreased cyclin D1 levels
were detected, PI staining was employed to examine cell
cycle changes in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells,
which showed that cells in G1 phase increased 50% to
60% in the Wnt5A knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells relative
to control vector transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure
4E). Moreover, TUNEL assays showed that doxorubicintreated Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells were set in
the course of apoptosis, and FACS analysis further showed
that the apoptotic rate was 0% and 5% in 0.85 μM and
1.7 μM doxorubicin-treated control knockdown MES-SA/
Dx5 cells, but apoptosis reached up to 25% and 43% in
similarly-treated Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells
(Figure 4F). These data indicated that Wnt5A controlled
PKA and β-catenin signaling in MDR cells.

Transcriptional control of ABCB1 by the β-catenin/
TCF response elements in the promoter has previously
been reported [18]. As data presented in the preceding
sections showed that β-catenin was regulated by Wnt5A
in drug-resistant cells, we therefore further evaluated
expression levels and functions of ABCB1 in Wnt5Aknockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Data from ABCB1luciferase reporter assays, quantitative RT-PCR and
western blot analysis showed that ABCB1 promoter
activities and protein expression levels were reduced in

Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells (Figure 5A and
B). Calcein AM is a useful dye for quantitative functional
analysis of ABCB1; lower fluorescence in Calcein AMstained cells means higher drug pump-out ability [25].
When the dye was used to monitor the ABCB1 functions
in Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells, the data
showed that the percentage of Calcein AM-stained cell
was increased by 40% in the Wnt5A knockdown cells
compared with the control cells (Figure 5C).

Dx5 cells showed reduced expression levels of ABCB1
and VEGF (Figure. 6E). The data demonstrated tumor
regression in the Wnt5A-knockdown tumor treated with
doxorubicin, suggesting that this Wnt5A-related pathway
contributes to MDR tumor progression.

Antibody neutralization of Wnt5A leads to
inhibition of β-catenin-related pathway and
reduces cell viability in drug-resistant cells

Reduction of tumor volume in Wnt5A shRNAknockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells in vivo

As Wnt5A is a secreted protein that affects cells in an
autocrine or paracrine manner, activation of Wnt5A/PKA/
β-catenin pathway was further confirmed in drug-resistant
cancer cells by depleting Wnt5A using a neutralizing
anti-Wnt5A antibody. Western blot analysis showed that
β-catenin, c-Myc and cyclin D1 of MES-SA/Dx5 and
MCF7/ADR2 were decreased in a dose-dependent manner
in anti-Wnt5A antibody treatment (Figure 7A). Increased
levels of GSK3β were also observed in anti-Wnt5A
antibody treated-MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells
(Figure 7A). On the other hand, the data revealed that CRE
and TOP activities of MES-SA/Dx5 were significantly
reduced with anti-Wnt5A antibody in a dose-dependent
manner (Figure 7B and 7C). Since lower levels of cyclin
D1 were detected, cell cycle progression was further
assessed in the anti-Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5
cells, which resulted in a delay in cell cycle progression
through G1/S and S/G2. In control antibody-treated MESSA/Dx5 cells, 28.73% of cells were in the G1 phase and

As shown above, Wnt5A knockdown improved
doxorubicin sensitivity of MES-SA/Dx5 cells in vitro.
To evaluate these observations in vivo, the tumor size and
viability of doxorubicin-treated Wnt5A-knockdown MESSA/Dx5 xenografts were determined. The IVIS luciferase
imaging results indicated that 7 or 14 days of doxorubicin
treatment led to slower growth in Wnt5A-knockdown
tumors when compared with the xenografts of the vector
control (Figure 6A and B). When tumors were collected
after 21 days of doxorubicin treatment, reduced tumor
sizes from the Wnt5A-knockdown groups were observed
(Figure. 6C). The tumor sizes of xenografts of Wnt5Aknockdown MES-SA/Dx5 cells were 2-, 3- and 4-fold
reduced in the mean relative tumor volume compared
to those of the vector control cells at 7, 14 and 21 days
of doxorubicin treatment, respectively (Figure. 6D).
Furthermore, xenografts of Wnt5A-knockdown MES-SA/

40.61% of cells were in the S phase. In the presence of
0.5 or 1 μg anti-Wnt5A antibody, 32.74% and 33.61% of
cells were in the G1 phase, while 49.34% and 50.87% of
cells remained in S phase, respectively (Figure 7D). As
decreased β-catenin expression levels were observed in
anti-Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells, and
β-catenin/Tcf is an important transcriptional regulator of
ABCB1, the drug efflux ability was next evaluated in the
anti-Wnt5A antibody-treated MES-SA/Dx5 cells. The
data showed that the mean fraction of calcein AM-stained
cells was 5.9% in the control antibody-treated MES-SA/
Dx5 cells, but cell fraction was increased to 7.6% and
19.4% when 0.5 or 1 μg anti-Wnt5A antibody was applied
(Figure 7E). Moreover, MTT assay data revealed that

the cell viability was 89.5% and 85.4% in 1 μg control
antibody and 0.85 μM doxorubicin co-treated MCF7/
ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells, respectively. Specifically,
after a combined application of 1 μg anti-Wnt5A antibody
with 0.85 μM doxorubicin, a further reduction in cell
viability of 55.3% and 57.4% was observed in MCF7/
ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5, respectively (Figure 7F and
7G). The data demonstrated that the drug pump out ability
and cell viability were decreased in Wnt-5A-depleted
MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells, further supporting
the secretion of Wnt5A to control the PKA/β-catenin
pathway in MDR cells.

angiogenesis of the drug-resistant cell line xenograft
model. Taken together, the relapsed tumors showed
significant increases of Wnt5A or ABCB1 expression after
chemotherapy. In spite of the relative small number of
paired breast tumor samples analyzed, the results supports
that Wnt5A activation is involved in chemoresistance of
breast cancer, consistent of the in vitro data.

number of TCF4/β-catenin binding sites are found on the
ABCB1 promoter [30] which indicates that Wnt pathwayrelated proteins are dominant transcription factors in
ABCB1 expression. Inhibition of β-catenin sensitized
the cells to paclitaxel and irinotecan [31] in colon cancer
SP cells and 5-FU in 5-FU-resistant cholangiocarcinoma
[32]. ABCB1, which is known to be responsible for drug
resistance in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), decreases
in expression levels after treating with β-catenin and Wnt1
shRNA [18]. Furthermore, induced Wnt/β-catenin signals
by several proteins lead to increased ABCB1 expression
level and promote drug resistance in different cancer cells
such as the PITX2 protein in renal cancer cell lines [33]
and retinoic acid receptor gamma in cholangiocarcinoma
[34]. These evidences support the observation presented in
this work on upregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway
in drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.
Our data indicated that the β-catenin-related pathway
was upregulated in the drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5 and
MCF7/ADR2 cells.

DISCUSSION
Interplay between the Wnt pathway and
multidrug resistance
In recent years, several laboratories have started
to focus on the relationship between the Wnt signaling
pathway and multidrug resistance. Enhancing β-catenin
signaling by treatment with GSK3β inhibitors in the
brain vasculature endothelial cells leads to elevated
ABCB1 expression [26]. The Wnt receptor, Fzd1, was
upregulated in a doxorubicin-resistant neuroblastoma
cell line [27], and Fzd1-slienced drug-resistant cells had
reduced ABCB1 expression levels and were sensitive to
chemotherapeutic treatment [19, 27, 28]. Colon cancer
patients with mutant β-catenin had higher ABCB1
expression [29], and Wnt signaling was activated in a
chemotherapy-resistant side-population (SP) of colon
cancer cells. Human ABCB1 expression level was
monitored by several transcription factors including AP1, EGR1, C/EBP, NF-κB and TCF4/β-catenin [30]. A

Role of the Wnt5A pathway in drug-resistance
cancer
In a previous study, evidences indicated
correlation between Wnt5A and cancer drug resistance.
Upregulation of Wnt5A was found in oxaliplatin-resistant
ovarian carcinoma cell line [35]. Ovarian cancer that
overexpressed Wnt5A also showed lower chemosensitivity
to paclitaxel, oxaliplatin, 5-fluorouracil, epirubicin and

Figure 9: A model of Wnt5A/PKA/β-catenin activation in the development of drug resistance in cancer cells. In the model,

hypomethylation of Wnt5A probably leads to upregulated expression of Wnt5A in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells. Subsequently,
Wnt5A activates PKA and PKA phosphorylates and inactivates GSK3β leading to activation of β-catenin and β-catenin-targeted genes
including ABCB1, cyclin D1 and c-Myc. The upregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc led to increase cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis in
MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells under chemotherapy treatment. The proposed model, based on experimental evidences presented
here, suggests that Wnt5A-mediated activation of downstream signal transducers is an important mechanism in the development of drug
resistance in MCF7/ADR2 and MES-SA/Dx5 cells.

etoposide [36]. Furthermore, Wnt5A and its receptor,
ROR2, were found to upregulate AKT/PKB survival
signaling in histone deacetylase inhibitor-resistant colon
cancer [37]. Wnt5A and NFATc2 were also upregulated
in expression in pancreatic cancer; inhibition of Wnt5A
led to significant increases in drug induced apoptosis
both in vitro and in vivo [38]. In this study, higher Wnt5A
expression observed in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2
cells resulted in β-catenin activation by a noncanonical
PKA pathway. Based on these evidences, Wnt5A is an
important signal protein associated with drug-resistance
in cancer.

drug in cancer cell and alternation of DNA methylation
pattern led to gene expression level change such as ABCB1
was hypermethylated in MCF7 compared to MCF7/ADR2
cell [49]. Hypomethylation genes, such as ABCB1, GSTpi,
MGMT, Upa and TGM2 had lower methylation ability in
MCF-7 doxorubicin-resistant cells and hypomethylation
of ABCB1 led to higher ABCB1 expression [50,
51]. Demethylation of ABCG2 was observed and
negatively associated with ABCG2 protein expression
in mitoxantrone-resistant multiple myeloma cells [52].
Our finding provided another evidences that upregulation
of Wnt5A controlled by DNA hypomethylation led to
increases in the expression levels of β-catenin-regulated
genes in MES-SA/Dx5 and MCF7/ADR2 cells.

Relationship between the PKA pathway in drugresistant cancer

Correlation and clinical outcomes of Wnt5A and
ABCB1 in clinical chemoresistance in breast
cancer patients

Type 1 cAMP-dependent Protein Kinase A-related
pathway is one of the pathways that modulates ABCB1
expression in multidrug-resistant breast cancer cells [39].
Selective PKA inhibitors were options to inhibit survival
of drug-resistant cancer cells [40]. Abnormal activation of
PKA increases DNA repair in cells which in turn results
in resistance to DNA damage [41]. Moreover, activation
of PKA leads to conversion of ER alpha inhibitor,
tamoxifen, into a growth stimulator in tamoxifen-resistant
breast cancer cells [42]. Hence, tamoxifen might become
beneficial to breast cancer patients who have lower levels
of PKA and ER alpha S305-P [43]. Elevated PKA signals
were also observed in trastuzumab resistance in Her2positive breast cancer [44]. PKA- and NF-kappa B-related
signals are upregulated in castrate-resistant prostate cancer
cells and a combined regime of inhibitors of PKA and NFkappa B with docetaxel significantly induces apoptosis in
castrate-resistant prostate cancer cells [45]. Furthermore,
PKA-related genes are reported to be associated with
MEK inhibitor resistance in colorectal cancer and 20-30%
non-small cell lung cancer [46].In this work, we observed
that PKA regulated the β-catenin pathway in MDR cancer
cells. Our data support the notion that PKA plays an
important role in drug resistance.

Overexpression of ABCB1 in tumor tissues of cancer
patients following chemotherapy is well established [53].
On the other hand, expression of FZD1 is highly correlated
to ABCB1 expression level [27, 28]. Since there are only
limited number of ABCB1 inhibitors currently available,
continued searches for activated molecular targets in
chemoresistant cancer are crucial for the development of
novel strategies for treating chemoresistant patients [54].
Towards this goal, expression of Wnt5A and ABCB1
in biopsies from 24 pre-and post-chemotherapeutictreated breast cancer patients were analyzed. The cohort
included 24 patients with relapses most likely due to
chemoresistance. Enhanced Wnt5A was detected in the
tumour biopsies, and significantly elevated Wnt5A and/
or ABCB1 expression was shown in biopsied samples
after chemotherapy (Figures 8A & 8B). It is anticipated
that a more extensive cohort of patients would confirm
our observations, which are highly consistent with the in
vitro data that Wnt5A and ABCB1 are both involved in
chemoresistance and cell survival.

Relationship between VEGF, Wnt5A and ABCB1
in multidrug-resistant cancer cells: a proposed
mechanism

Methylation induced by doxorubicin in MDR cells
In our research, hypomethylation of the Wnt5A
intron was found in drug-resistant MES-SA/Dx5
and MCF7/ADR2 cells and this methylation site
regulated Wnt5A expression level in both cells. Based
on the reported results, DNA methylation inhibitors,
hydralazine and magnesium valproate, were combined
with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide used in the
clinical breast cancer patients [47]. In addition, the global
epigenetic changes played an important role in acquired
drug-resistant phenotype of MCF7 drug resistance cells
[48]. On the other hand, previous study indicated that
DNA methylation status was affluence by chemotherapy

Higher expression levels of both secreted Wnt5A
and secreted VEGF in multidrug-resistant MES-SA/
Dx5, KB-V1, NCI/ADR-RES and SW620-MDR1 cells
(Supplementary Figure 2). Furthermore, In the Wnt5Aknockdown xenograft model, decreased angiogenesis
and reduced VEGF and ABCB1 expression levels were
observed (Figure 6E). VEGF and ABCB1 are both
β-catenin-targeted genes [18, 55]. In the previous study,
increased Wnt5A, β-catenin and VEGF-A were found in
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [56], and Wnt5A
expression was correlated to expression of VEGF, Ki67,

androgen receptor in prostate cancer [57]. Despite the
need to clarify the relationship between ABCB1 and
VEGF, upregulation of VEGF-A and VEGF-B was found
in NSCLC side population (SP) cells, accompanied by
overexpression of ABCG2 and ABCB1 mRNAs [58].
Besides, ABCB1 and VEGF enhanced the invasion
properties of MDR cells [59]. These are evidences to
indicate that VEGF-related signaling is upregulated in
MDR cancer cells. Based on our observation, VEGF
inhibitor may be an option for inhibiting MDR cells.

supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM
antimycotics (Invitrogen).

Western blot analysis
Western blot analysis of indicated proteins was
performed as described previously [65]. The antibodies
used were as follows: anti-Wnt5A (sc-30224, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, CA), anti- MDR-1(sc-13131,
Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-cMyc (sc-70496, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti- cyclin D1(sc-8396, Santa
Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p-β-catenin, anti-p-GSK3β
(sc11757, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA), anti-GSK3β
(sc-9166, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-catenin (138400, Invitrogen), and anti-β-actin (MAB1501, Millipore,
Billerica, MA).

CONCLUSIONS
This study presented results on the involvement of
Wnt5A and the subsequent activation of the non-canonical
PKA/β-catenin pathway in chemoresistance in two drugresistant cell lines and in biopsied samples from breast
cancer patients. Interestingly, VEGF upregulation was
found in MDR cancers. These observations are useful for
searching for novel therapeutic targets in chemoresistant
patients.

H-89 and 5-aza-cytidine treatment
Each cell line was treated with H-89 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, CA) at the indicated concentration for
48 h. Then, protein expression levels were assessed
by western blot analysis. MES-SA cell line was treated
with 5μM 5-aza-cytidine (Sigma). Then, Wnt5A mRNA
expression was assayed by quantitative PCR. DNA
methylation status was assayed by COBRA assay.

MATERIAL AND METHODS

shRNA and plasmid construction
The Wnt5A shRNA clone (TRCN0000062717;
CGTGGACCAGTTTGTGTGCAA) targeting at the
human Wnt5A was purchased from the National RNAi
Core Facility (Academia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan). For
construction of the red fluroscence protein (RFP) shRNA
expression plasmids, the Blasticidin GSGF2A turboRFP
fragment was obtained by AvrII and BamH I double
digestion of TRC009 (Academia Sinica) and ligated to the
AvrII- and BamH I-digested TRC001-based shRNA vector
of clone TRCN0000062717. The resulting construct was
designated as pRFP- shWnt5A.

cAMP detection
Cells were plated at a density of 1 ×105 cells/well
in a 24-well plate. The cells were then treated with the
indicated concentrations of PKA inhibitor, H-89. After 48
h of drug treatment, cells were assayed by cAMP Direct
Immunoassay Kit, Colorimetric (Calbiochem) according

well plates. The reaction mixture was 1 μl RT product,
15 μl RealQ-PCR Master Mix Kit (Ampliqon AqS,
Denmark), 1 μl each of 10 μM forward and reverse
primers (Supplementary Table 2), and the total volume
was adjusted to 10 μl with nuclease-free water. The realtime PCR program was: pre-incubation at 50 oC for 2 min,
initial denaturation at 95 oC for 7 min, and 45 cycles at 95
o
C for 10 s, 60 oC for 15 s and 72 oC for 30 s. The program
was terminated by a final extension at 60 oC for 1 min and
cooling at 40 oC for 5 min. For normalization, the mRNA
level of the β-actin gene in each RNA preparation was
determined. Relative gene expression was determined by
the ∆∆Ct method, where Ct=threshold cycle. The relative
targeted mRNA levels were normalized to the mRNA
level of the reference β-actin gene. The melting curve of
the amplification product was always checked to ensure a
single clean peak that represented good-quality real-time
PCR data.

Cells were transfected with DNA of indicated
concentration premixed with Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen) as described previously [66]. After 48 h
of incubation, cell medium was collect for detection of
CRE activities by SEAP assays, and cells were lysed by
the Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) to perform TOP or
ABCB1 transactivation activity detection by luciferase
assays. Cell viability was determined in MTT assays and
cells were assayed for cell cycle changes by PI staining.
To determine apoptosis, TUNEL assays were performed.

Antibody treatment
Cells were plated at a density of 1 ×105 cells/well
in a 24-well plate. The cells were then treated with the
indicated concentrations of Wnt5A antibody (sc-30224,
Santa Cruz) [67]. After 48 h of antibody treatment, cell
lysates was collect for western blot, cell medium was
collect for detection of CRE activities by SEAP assays,
cells were lysed by the Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega) to
perform TOP activity detection by luciferase assays and
cells were collect for detection of drug pump-out ability
by Calcein AM assay. After 24 h of antibody treatment, the
cells were then treated with the indicated concentrations
of doxorubicin. After 48 h of incubation,cell viability was
determined in MTT assays.

Cell viability MTT assay
Cells were plated at a density of 1×105 cells/well
in a 24-well plate. The cells were then treated with the
indicated concentrations of various drugs or transfected
with the indicated plasmid. After 48 h of incubation,
the medium was removed and phosphate buffered
saline (PBS) was used to wash the cells. Thiazolyl blue
tetrazolium (Sigma-Aldrich) (200 µl) was added to each
well and was incubated with the cells at 37 °C for 2 h.
Subsequence, 400 μl DMSO was added to each well and
incubation at 37 °C was continued for 20 min. Absorbance
of the mixture was read at 540 nm using a Microplate
Reader (VersaMax, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Cell viability (%) was calculated as the fraction of the
surviving cells in each drug-treated experiment set to that
of the control.

Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis (COBRA)
Genomic DNAs extraction and bisulfite conversion
were performed as described previously [68]. Briefly,
for the amplification of the human Wnt5A intron I, PCR
was performed using 10 ng of the bisulfite-converted
genomic DNA as a template. The primer sets of COBRAPCR were listed as follows: The Wnt 5A COBRA 1 F
sequence was 5’-TGTTTGAGTTTATTTAGTGG-3’.
The Wnt 5A COBRA 1R sequence was
5’-AAAAAAACTAAAAACCAACTACTCC-3’. Purified
PCR products were then digested with 10 U of Hha I (New
England Biolabs) at 37°C. The quantification criterion of
COBRA was as previously published [69].

Cell cycle analysis by FLOW cytometry
Cells were plated at a density of 1×105 cells/well
in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, the cells were transfected
with the indicated plasmid or treated with the indicated
antibody for 48 h. The cells were then harvested and fixed
with 1 ml of 70% ice-cold ethanol. The fixed cells were
pelleted and suspended in lysis buffer (0.5% Triton X-100
and RNAse A at 10 μg/ml) (Sigma-A) at 37 °C for 1 h.
The cells were stained with 50 μg/ml propidium iodine
(Chemicon). After 20 min of incubation at 4 °C in the dark,
the cells were analyzed using a FCM scan flow cytometer
using the CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, San Jose,
CA). The percentage of cells in the apoptotic sub-G1 and
G1, S-phase and G2-M phase were calculated using the
Modfit software (Verity Software House, Topsham, ME).

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
The RT-PCR was performed as previously described
[70]. Brief, total RNA (2 μg) was prepared from the
transfectants and was treated with DNase I. RNA was
reverse transcribed into cDNAs at 42 oC for 60 min using
Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase
(Invitrogen). After the oligo(dT)-primed reverse
transcription reaction, real-time PCR was performed in
a LightCycler 480 (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) in 96www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

7 and 14 after doxorubicin treatment. The tumor volume
(V) was measured by a vernier scale every 7 days up to 3
weeks, and calculated as V (mm3)=(L×W2)/2, where L was
the largest diameter and W was the diameter perpendicular
to L. On day 21 of doxorubicin treatment, all mice
were sacrificed and tumors were resected, weighed and
frozen or fixed in formalin and paraffin embedded for
immunohistochemical studies.

Cell cultures were fixed and detection of
DNA-strand breaks was performed by the terminal
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling
(TUNEL) method using the Apo-BrdU In Situ DNA
Fragmentation Assay Kit (BioVision, Mountain View,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and as
previous reported [71]. TUNEL staining-positive cells
were detected by flow cytometry using Cellquest Pro
FACS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA).

Bioluminescent IVIS imaging System
Xenografted nude mice were kept in a chamber and
were anesthetized with 2% isofluorane/oxygen mixture
and intraperitoneally injected with 20 mg/ml D-luciferin
(Promega) in PBS (200 mg/kg). Mice were sedated using
isoflurane, and live anesthetized mice were imaged using
the Bioluminescent IVIS Imaging system (Xenogen Corp.,
Alameda, CA). The resulting light emission was quantified
using the Living Image software (Xenogen). Raw values
were reported as photons/second/cm2/sr.

Calcein-acetoxymethyl ester assays for ABCB1
functions
A calcein acetoxymethylester (calcein AM) assay
was performed using the MultiDrugQuantTM Assay kit
(CHEMICON). Briefly, cells were plated at a density
of 1×105 cells/well in a 24-well plate. After 24 h, the
cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid for
48 h. Calcein-AM was added at 25 nM into each well
and the cells were incubated for 20 min before being
trypsinized with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA for 2 min and
pelleted. Supernatant was removed after centrifugation at
800 g. One ml medium was used to resuspend the cell
pellet for FLOW cytometry analysis using Cellquest Pro
FACS (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA). Distribution
of the green-fluorescent protein calcein in the cells was
observed by FLOW cytometry. The percentage relative
fluorescence (RFL) in the cells was expressed as: % FL
= [(FL treatment – FL nontreatment)/FL nontreatment] ×
100%.

Breast cancer patients and immunohistochemical
staining studies
The 24 tumor paired tumor tissue biopsied samples
for immunohistochemical analyses were obtained from
breast cancer patients at diagnosis and after treatment
from 1995 to 2014 at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital
(CGMH)-Linkou Medical Center. Tumor materials were
collected after informed consent and with approval from
Institutional Review Board of CGMH (IRB:101-4592B).
All patients received surgery and treatment according
to international protocols, including doxorubicin-based
chemotherapy. Biopsies of paired cancer samples were
obtained from the patients immediately after surgery at
diagnosis, and after at least one course of chemotherapy.
Immunostaining was performed with anti-ABCB1, antiVEGF and anti-Wnt5A antibodies (Santa Cruz) using
the Dako-REAL, Alkaline-Phosphatase/RED detection
system (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Hematoxylin was
used for counterstaining according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The staining intensity of each malignant tissue
was evaluated and scored by pathologists. The Wnt5A,
ABCB1 and VEGF-A staining was scored for a tumor
using an H-score that had been obtained by multiplying
the staining intensity (graded as 0, negative; 1+, weak; 2+,
moderate; and 3+, strong) (see Supplementary Figure 3)
by the percentage of tumor cells with positive cytoplasmic
staining (0% to 100%). H-score to verify the IHC results
was as described previously [72, 73].

Tumor xenografts in nude mice
Eight week-old male nude mice were purchased
from the National Laboratory Animal Center (Taipei,
Taiwan). All experimental procedures involving the use
of animals for experimental purposes were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees
(IACUC) of Chang Gung University under the protocol
number CGU11-113. The mice were maintained in an airconditioned animal facility under constant temperature
and humidity conditions with a 12:12 light-dark cycle and
the mice were allowed ad libitum in the diet or drinking
water. Mice were randomly picked to different groups and
each group had 5 or more mice. Wnt5A shRNA or control
scramble shRNA-transfected MES-SA/Dx5 cells (1×106)
was mixed with Matrigel (BD Bioscience, San Jose,
CA) followed by subcutaneous injection into the dorsal
region near the thigh of the mice. Upon 1 month of tumor
establishment, mice were intraperitoneally injected with
the indicated concentrations of doxorubicin or PBS. The
