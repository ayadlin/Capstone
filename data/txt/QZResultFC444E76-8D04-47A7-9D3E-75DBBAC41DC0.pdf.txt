ABSTRACT
A systematic analysis of the genes involved in taxol resistance (txr) has never
been performed. In the present study, we created txr ovarian carcinoma cell lines
to identify the genes involved in chemoresistance. Transcriptome analysis revealed
1,194 overexpressed genes in txr cells. Among the upregulated genes, more than
12 cryptic transcription factors were identified using MetaCore analysis (including AR,
C/EBPβ, ERα, HNF4α, c-Jun/AP-1, c-Myc, and SP-1). Notably, individual silencing of
these transcription factors (except HNF4a)sensitized txr cells to taxol. The androgen
receptor (AR) and its target genes were selected for further analysis. Silencing AR
using RNA interference produced a 3-fold sensitization to taxol in txr cells, a response
similar to that produced by silencing abcb1. AR silencing also downregulated the
expression of prominent txr gene candidates (including abcb1, abcb6, abcg2, bmp5,
fat3, fgfr2, h1f0, srcrb4d, and tmprss15). In contrast, AR activation using the agonist
DHT upregulated expression of the target genes. Individually silencing seven out of
nine (78%) AR-regulated txr genes sensitized txr cells to taxol. Inhibition of AKT
and JNK cellular kinases using chemical inhibitors caused a dramatic suppression of
AR expression. These results indicate that the AR represents a critical driver of gene
expression involved in txr.

resistance. Probably the most important ABC protein in
this context is glycoprotein P (P-gp) which is encoded
by the ABCB1 gene (multidrug resistance protein 1, or
MDR1) [3–5]. This protein functions as a drug efflux
pump that can actively remove around 20 different
cytostatic drugs from cancer cells. At least 10 additional
ABC proteins may be involved in drug resistance [6].
Another group of membrane transporters involved in
drug resistance is the SLC transporters, which function
mainly as influx carriers [7]; these proteins are often
downregulated in chemoresistant cells [8–10]. Spindle
microtubules are the primary target of taxol. This

INTRODUCTION
The taxanes paclitaxel (taxol) and docetaxel are
microtubule-stabilizing agents that function primarily by
interfering with spindle microtubule dynamics, ultimately
causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. These agents have
become widely recognized as active chemotherapeutic
agents in the treatment of breast and ovarian cancer,
among others. However, their therapeutic usefulness is
limited by acquired de novo resistance [1, 2]. Membrane
transporters from the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) and
solute carrier (SLC) families play a major role in drug

chemotherapeutic drug disrupts microtubules by binding
to their interior surface [11]. Specific checkpoint proteins
such as BRCA1 and the spindle assembly checkpoint
proteins MAD2, BUBR1, synuclein-gamma and aurora
A have all emerged as potential biomarkers of taxol
resistance. In addition, the effects of MDR-1/P-gp on
taxol resistance were extensively studied in vitro but the
data remain conflicting. Despite these advances, no valid
biomarkers exist that can predict resistance to taxanes in
breast cancer [1]. Overexpression of MDR-1/P-gp and
altered expression of microtubule-associated proteins
(MAPs), including tau, stathmin, and MAP4, may help
identify patients at risk of recurrence and most likely to
benefit from taxane treatment [2].
Androgen-dependent activation of the androgen
receptor (AR) is required for prostate-specific antigen
production and survival of both normal and malignant
prostate epithelial cells. Androgen deprivation therapy
via surgical or medical castration remains the standard
form of treatment for clinically advanced prostate
cancer. For a number of years, docetaxel was the only
treatment showing proven survival benefit for patients
with castration-resistant prostate cancers [12]. Steroid
hormones have been involved in the development and
progression of epithelial ovarian cancer, an observation
which suggests a role for androgens in this context; for
instance, chemotherapy has been shown to decrease
androgen production by cancer cells [13]. Although the
AR is expressed in both normal and cancerous ovaries,
we possess a limited understanding of AR activity in
ovarian cancer cells. Notably, a number of studies showed
that AR is overexpressed in ovarian cancer [14–18].
Epidemiological evidence and laboratory data strongly
support a critical role for androgens in the origin and
promotion of epithelial ovarian cancer and have led
to clinical trials designed to target the AR (reviewed
in ref.  [19]). There is evidence for cross-talk between
androgen signaling and other signaling pathways. For
example, AR activation by dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
in SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells and ascites-derived
OVCAS-16 cells prevented the growth inhibitory effect
of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), while DHT
alone had no effect on cell growth [20]. The effect of
DHT was associated with downregulation of TGF-β1
and TGF-β2 receptors. However, it is uncertain whether
AR activity is an important target of taxol in treatment
of ovarian cancer. Studies examining regulation of gene
expression are needed to determine the mechanism
underlying the activity of the AR in mediating cell
response to chemotherapy.
Upon binding androgens, the AR mediates the
effects of male sex steroids by binding to cis-elements
in the regulatory regions of target genes and regulating
expression of androgen-dependent genes.. AR is a
transcription factor with eight exons encoding five
functional domains: a large amino-terminal transactivation
domain (encoded by exon 1) [21]; a central DNA-binding
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

domain (encoded by exons 2 and 3); a carboxy-terminal,
ligand-binding domain (encoded by exons 4–8); and a
hinge region (between the DNA-binding domain and
ligand-binding domain) that contributes to nuclear
localization and protein degradation [22]. The DNAbinding domain of the AR recognizes a palindromic
response element that comprises an inverted repeat of
the 5′-AGAACA-3′ hexamer with a 3-nucleotide spacer,
usually termed the canonical androgen/glucocorticoid
response element (ARE/GRE) [23]. Comparison of ARbinding events in the epididymis and prostate of wildtype (wt) and SPARKI mice (whose AR DNA-binding
domain has the second zinc finger replaced by that of
the glucocorticoid receptor) revealed that AR achieves
selective chromatin binding through a less stringent
sequence requirement for the 3′-hexamer [24].
Considering that taxanes are important chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of various cancers, we
examined the mechanism of resistance in order to optimize
the use of these drugs during cancer treatment. Using a
microarray analysis, we searched for new candidate
genes that may play a role in taxol resistance (txr). Using
MetaCore analysis, we predicted driver genes involved in
txr. Functional analysis of the identified driver genes and
downstream target genes using RNA interference (RNAi)
significantly sensitized txr cells to taxol compared to
parental cells. Specifically, the AR was selected to further
study the mechanism of activation of target txr genes in
the context of taxol resistance. Our results provide several
insights to build the gene network involved in txr.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and reagents
SKOV3 cells (American Type Culture Collection,
Rockville, MD, USA) were grown as monolayers in a 1:1
mixture of DMEM/nutrient F-12 Ham (Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 1% (w/v)
penicillin/streptomycin and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS) at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing
5% CO2. The chemotherapeutic drugs used included
vincristine, taxol (paclitaxel), and cisplatin (Bristol-Myers
Squibb, New York, NY, USA). Unless indicated otherwise,
chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA). All reagents were used according to the
instructions provided by the supplier.

Taxol-resistant cell lines
Taxol-resistant ovarian cancer cells were prepared
from the parental, drug-sensitive, ovarian cancer cell
line SKOV3 by administrating taxol in a conventional
dose-escalation manner. The concentration of taxol
was increased stepwise, starting at 50 nM and ending at
600 nM. Parental SKOV3 cells were first exposed to 50 nM
of taxol for 2 months followed by exposure to stepwise

double concentrations of taxol for a further 2 months of
treatment. Chemo-resistant cell lines were maintained in
selective medium containing the taxol concentration used
for selection of resistance. The cells were cultured in taxolfree medium for one week before further studies. Periodic
evaluation of half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50)
confirmed that the txr phenotype was stable for at least 2
months in a drug-free medium.

normalization method. The original DNA microarray
data was deposited into the GEO database (GSE58840).
Normalized spot intensities were transformed to gene
expression log 2 ratios between parental and resistant
groups under Rosetta Resolver error model adjustment.
Fold change values were calculated from adjusted log 2
ratios and were used for selecting differentially-expressed
genes. Independent t-tests were used to evaluate statistical
significance. Genes whose expression levels were higher
than the assumed threshold (upregulated > 2 fold and
downregulated < 2 fold) were identified using the scatter
plot method and selected for further analysis.

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined using the in vitro
MTT [3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyl-2Htetrazolium bromide] colorimetric method as previously
described [25]. One hundred μl of cells was seeded at a
density of 3 × 104 cells/ml in 96-well microplates. Cells
were exposed to taxol in culture medium at 37°C for 72 h.
Twenty μl of MTT solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was added
to each well, prior to incubation for 4 h. Optical density
(OD) of the purple formazan product was measured at a
wavelength of 540 nm using a spectrophotometer. The
50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50) of cell proliferation
or cell viability were defined as the levels that respectively
cause 50% reduction in cell viability versus the DMSOtreated control.

Gene network analysis
Genes found to be overexpressed in taxol-resistant
SKOV3/Tx600 cells were extracted and subsequently
used to build a network in the software MetaCore
Analytical Suite 6.13 build 61585 (Thomson Reuters,
Philadelphia, PA, USA). The 1, 194 upregulated genes
of the DNA microarray analysis dataset (GSE58840)
that were expressed more than 2 fold in SKOV3/Tx 600
cells compared to parental SKOV3 cells were considered.
Using the “transcription regulation” algorithm, we
generated a transcription regulation network, and used
the “direct interactions” algorithm between network
objects (txr genes) with top ranked transcription drivers
in a default, high trust p value set. AR was selected as
an interesting element for building the network. The
112 genes that were expressed more than 10-fold in
SKOV3/Tx 600 cells compared to parental SKOV3 cells
are partially listed in Table 1. Among the algorithms
available, the “direct interactions” function was selected
to build the network, and no other element from the
MetaCore database was added. For easy visualization,
some unlinked genes were omitted in the network. Nine
transcription factors including the AR were selected for
further experiments.

Quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted with the Trizol reagent
(Life Technologies) as previously described [26]. RNA
concentrations were assessed using a spectrophotometer,
and only the samples with an A260/A280 ratio between
1.9 and 2.2 were used. Real-time quantitative PCR was
performed on total RNA as before [26].

Oligonucleotide DNA microarray
Fluorescent RNA targets were prepared from 5 μg
total RNA of SKOV3 and taxol-resistant derivative cells
using OneArray Amino Allyl aRNA Amplification Kit
(Phalanx Biotech Group, Hsinchu, Taiwan) and Cy5
dyes (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Fluorescent
targets were hybridized to the Human Whole Genome
OneArray v6.1 microarray, which contains 31, 741 DNA
oligonucleotide probes (HOA6.1; Phalanx Biotech Group)
with Phalanx OneArray Plus Hybridization Protocol.
The slides were dried by centrifugation, followed by
scanning using the Agilent G2505C Microarray Scanner
and GenePix software GenePix Pro 4.1.1.44 (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) to obtain background
subtracted and spatially de-correlated processed signal
intensities. The signal intensity of each spot was
transferred to the Rosetta Resolver System (Rosetta
Biosoftware, Seattle, WA, USA) for data analysis. The
error model of the Rosetta Resolver System removed
both systematic and random errors. Spots that passed the
selection criteria were normalized using the median scaling
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blotting
Cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphatebuffered saline (pH 7.4) and lyzed on ice for 30 min
using standard cell lysis buffer. After centrifugation for
15 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed and protein
concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein
assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Fifty μg of proteins
from each sample was separated on a 10% sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel and electro-blotted onto
polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes (Millipore,
Bedford, MA, USA). After electroblotting, the membranes
were blocked in 5% non-fat dry milk (dissolved in 0.1 M
Trizma base, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 7.4).
Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies
raised against either MDR1 or GAPDH (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) in the blocking
solution containing 3% non-fat dry milk.

examined. The txr cell lines SKOV3/Tx50 and SKOV3/
Tx600 displayed resistance to both taxol (Fig. 1A) and
vincristine (Fig. 1C). However, the cell lines showed no
resistance to cisplatin (Fig. 1B). A resistance factor (RF),
calculated as the IC50 of txr cells divided by the IC50 of
parental cells, was used to quantify the level of resistance

(Fig. 1A and 1C, RFs are given within parentheses).
Monitoring of sub-G1 cells revealed that txr cells showed
significantly reduced apoptosis levels in response to both
taxol and vincristine, whereas response to cisplatin was
similar in parental and txr cells (Fig. 1D–1F). Similarly,
caspase activation analysis indicated that txr cells

showed reduced caspase activation and c-PARP cleavage
following treatment with taxol and vincristine, while no
significant change was noted for cisplatin (Fig. 1G–1I).
Taken together, these results indicate that SKOV3/Tx50
and SKOV3/Tx600 cells are moderately and highly
resistant to taxol, respectively.
To study the molecular basis of txr, we used a
whole genome microarray to compare the transcriptome
profile of parental and highly-resistant SKOV3/Tx600
cells. We identified 2, 677 genes that were differentially
expressed at least 2 fold between these cells, including
1, 194 upregulated genes and 1, 483 downregulated genes.
Using q-PCR, we confirmed that the most upregulated
genes in the microarray data were indeed overexpressed
(Table 1; also including ABCG2 and ABCB6 which were
less upregulated compared to other genes). The primer
sequences used for each gene are shown in Table 2.
Three patterns of upregulated genes were noticed [28]: 1)
similarly upregulated in both poorly and highly resistant
cells; 2) upregulated 2–4 fold in poorly resistant cells and
over 4 fold in highly resistant cells; and 3) upregulated
over 4 fold in poorly resistant cells and 2–4 folds in highly
resistant cells (data not shown). For example, in the first
category, 716 and 684 genes were upregulated in poorly
and highly resistant cells, respectively, while 94 genes
were upregulated in both cells. Notably, these common
upregulated genes were not enriched in specific metabolic
pathways. For instance, the top-ranking pathway in
ATM/ATR regulation of cell cycle checkpoint covered
only two genes (gadd45a and cds1) (P < 0.005). In the
third category, 196 and 1, 017 genes were upregulated in
poorly and highly resistant phenotypes, respectively, while
47 genes were upregulated in both types of cells. Genes
of the third category, which were highly upregulated in
the early stage (poorly resistant cells) following exposure
of parental cells to taxol but which showed a low level
of upregulation in the later stage (highly resistant cells),
are potentially required for the upregulation of resistance
genes. The “early onset” genes such as FKBP5/AR [28]
and those involved in the development of txr appear to be
worthy of further studies.
The upregulated genes identified in txr cells were
analyzed using the MetaCore platform (see Materials and
Methods) in order to reveal potential connections between
gene activities involved in resistance. A network analysis
of these genes suggested induction of transcriptional
factors that are too low to be detected by microarray.
We did not identify an enriched cluster of upregulated
genes that are involved in specific cell functions by this
method. Twelve genes that interact with a large number
of genes were indicated (including AP1/c-Jun, AR, C/
EBP, ERα, HNF4-α, c-Myc, and SP1). These driver genes
encode nuclear transcription factors and their interacting
gene products are indicated in Fig. 2. These transcription
factor genes showed more than ten interactions each. In
addition, they, AR and c-Myc for example, appeared to
mutually regulate each other. Genes that were upregulated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

more than ten fold in SKOV3/Tx600 cells were grouped as
specific driver genes according to Metacore analysis, and
their expression levels were confirmed by qPCR analysis.
The genes identified are briefly described in Table 1.

Silencing “cryptic” or minimally-upregulated
driver genes causes taxol sensitization
To test the possibility that the identified driver
txr genes regulate cell sensitivity to taxol, we silenced
these genes individually. Silencing of AR sensitized
SKOV3/Tx600 cells to the drug (SF50=3.0; Fig.  3A).
The sensitization factor (SF50) was defined as the
concentration that reduces cell viability by 50% (IC50)
in the gene silencing treatment divided by the IC50 of
shLuc-treated control. Silencing the other driver genes
also sensitized txr cells to taxol: c-Jun (SF50=1.9),
C/EBPβ (SF50=1.4), ERα (SF50=3.0), c-Myc (SF50=1.6),
SP1 (SF50=3.2), STAT3 (SF50=2.1), and PPARγ (SF50=2.9;
Fig. 3B–3I). However, silencing HNF4α did not produce
a significant level of sensitization (SF50=1.1; Fig. 3E). It
should be noted that the driver genes were considered
“cryptic” drivers because they were only minimally
overexpressed compared to parental cells, and some did
not reach a statistical significant level of upregulation
(Fig. 3J). However, their upregulated protein levels were
readily detected in txr cells, except for SP1 (Fig. 3K,
six proteins are shown for examples). Interestingly, only
minimal or no sensitization to cisplatin was detected
following silencing of the driver genes in parental cells
(data not shown). Furthermore, silencing the driver genes
sensitized other ovarian carcinoma cell lines to taxol; for
instance, knockdown of the AR sensitized MDAH-2774
and TOV21G cell lines to taxol at levels similar to those
observed for SKOV3/Tx600 cells (SF50 = 2.2 and 2.9,
respectively; data not shown). Notably, chromatin
immunoprecipitation analysis (ChIP) indicated that AR
was constitutively bound to six txr genes (selected at
random), and that four of these genes were upregulated
following activation of AR (Fig. S1). These results
suggest that the driver gene products at protein level and/
or transactivation activity may play an important role in
txr by upregulating their target genes.

AR expression and nuclear location affect taxol
sensitivity
To assess the role of driver genes, we selected
AR for functional study since this gene possesses many
functions and its dysregulation is associated with cancer.
DNA microarray analysis indicated a slight increase of AR
transcript in SKOV3/Tx50 and around 1.5-fold increase
in SKOV3/Tx600 cells compared to parental cells. Using
a more quantitative q-PCR analysis, we observed that AR
expression was respectively 40-fold and 165-fold higher
in SKOV3/Tx50 and SKOV3/Tx600 cells compared to the
level of expression in parental cells (Fig. 4A). Notably, both

Figure 2: Network of txr genes. MetaCore analysis of transcriptome profiling identifies drivers for upregulated txr genes. 112 genes that

were overexpressed over 10-fold in SVKO3/Tx600 cells were subjected to MetaCore analysis by setting AR as target gene (see Materials
and Methods). Note that AR and other prominent gene products/transcription factors or drivers were identified (NFκB, CREB1, c-Myc,
HNF4α, SP1, ERα, CATA1, c-Jun/AP1, GCRα, EGR1, and C/EBPβ). Each driver gene product interacts with unique target txr genes. Only
direct interactors are shown. Green lines, positive regulations according to public database; gray lines, unspecified but potentially novel
interactions. Symbols are indicated at bottom.

sensitization

total and nuclear AR protein levels were increased in txr
cells, and the level of this protein correlated with the extent
of resistance (Fig. 4B–4C and 3K). Silencing of AR using
shRNA reduced AR mRNA expression (Fig. 3A), and
sensitized txr cells to taxol-induced apoptosis and cell
death (Fig. 3A and Fig. 4D–4E). These results indicate that
AR expression and its localization to the nucleus may be
associated with txr.

To clarify the role of AR-target genes, each potential
txr gene was silenced using shRNA. Silencing of txr
genes sensitized SKOV3/Tx600 cells cells to taxol to a
high level (ABCB1, FGFR2, BMP5, ABCG2, ABCB6),
moderate level (H1F0), or low level (FAT3), whereas no
sensitization was noted for TMPRSS15 and SRCRB4D
(Fig. 6). These results indicate that the AR-target genes
tested (7/9 or 78%) are also involved in txr. Furthermore,
drug sensitization produced by silencing of these txr genes
could also be found in the ovarian carcinoma cell lines
MDAH-2774 and TOV21G, as seen for example when
FGFR2 was silenced (SF50=1.3 and 2.2, respectively)
(Fig. S1).

AR activity positively regulates txr genes
To assess whether AR induces expression of the
potential txr genes, we performed loss-of-function and
gain-of-function experiments to monitor the regulation of
nine highly upregulated txr genes. All potential txr genes
were downregulated in SKOV3/Tx600 cells following
silencing of AR (Fig. 5A). In contrast, activation of AR
by the agonist DHT (which produced a dose-dependent
increase of nuclear AR levels, Fig. 5B) dramatically
enhanced the expression of txr genes (Fig. 5C). These
results indicate that AR drives the expression of the target
txr genes.

Identification of AKT pathway as a target of
taxol in regulating AR activity and cell sensitivity

of AR activation, we treated cells with taxol to induce
activation of the major kinases. Assuming that kinase

activation is required for the effects of AR activation,
inhibition of kinase activity should cause a reduction
of AR expression level or activity. Both parental cells
and SKOV3/Tx600 cells were exposed to equitoxic
concentration of taxol. Activation of AKT and p38 in the
txr cells was rapidly inhibited by taxol (Fig. 7A, lanes
5–8). While ERK1/2 activation minimally increased in txr
cells and was also inhibited by taxol, JNK activation in txr
cells was induced by taxol. In contrast, all kinase activities
were minimally or not induced by taxol in parental
cells (see  Fig.  7A, lanes 1–4). Treatment of SKOV3/

Tx600 cells with inhibitor of these kinases indicated
that only AKT and JNK inhibition (Wortmannin and
SP600125, respectively) downregulated AR expression
(Fig. 7B). These results suggest that the AKT pathway
is likely to represent a target of taxol in regulating AR
expression. Supporting this possibility, we observed
that treatment with the same taxol concentration used
in Fig. 1A produced similar changes in pAKT and AR
protein levels (Fig. 7C). The nuclear AR fraction was also
examined in txr cells exposed to taxol or Wortmannin.
Nuclear AR levels were dramatically inhibited by taxol

DISCUSSION

in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7D). While cytosolic
AR levels remained unchanged following treatment with
various concentrations of taxol, nuclear AR levels were
reduced in a dose-dependent manner by taxol (Fig. 7D).
Similarly, nuclear AR levels were reduced in a timedependent manner by Wortmannin (Fig. 7E). To verify the
biological significance of the Akt pathway in mediating
taxol sensitivity, we treated SKOV3 and SKOV3/Tx600
cells with taxol in the presence or absence of Wortmannin.
The sensitization factor obtained was 1.6 and 54.3 for
SKOV3 and SKOV3/Tx600 cells, respectively (Fig. 7F),
supporting the notion that this pathway is involved in
AR-mediated txr.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In this study, we identified drivers of a panel of
genes involved in txr. Although these driver genes were
not considerably overexpressed, they displayed significant
inhibition of taxol sensitivity in our study model. In
addition to the driver genes identified, AR, as an example,
was shown to activate 13 target txr genes which are highly
upregulated in txr cells. Functional studies using 9 of
these genes confirmed the biological relevance of the txr
genes identified in regulating response to taxol. Silencing
a single of these genes (i.e., AR) was sufficient to sensitize
txr cells to taxol at levels comparable to the sensitization

effect produced by silencing the ABCB1 gene, the typical
marker gene whose upregulation is known to be involved
in multidrug resistance [4]. The use of the method
developed here appears to be critical for the identification
of these genes since the driver genes identified were not
considerably overexpressed (thus the use of the term
cryptic to describe them) in txr cells based on microarray
data. This method may thus be useful to identify further
driver genes involved in chemoresistance.
Among 2,677 genes that were differentially
expressed in txr cells, we found 1,194 upregulated
genes in SKOV3 txr cells. Using MetaCore analysis, we
identified AR as a leading driver of gene expression for
susceptibility genes associated with the txr phenotype,
including membrane proteins (ABCB1, ABCB6,
ABCG2, FGFR2, TMPRSS15) and chromatin protein
(H1F0). Several other transcription factors (ER, c-Myc,
AP-1, STAT3, PPAR-gamma) are also found each to be
important for upregulation of a group of txr candidate
genes. AR recruitment is significantly altered during
disease progression and this can arise through changes in
the expression of other transcription factors and chromatin
modifiers. Proteins that regulate AR activity and the
AR-regulated transcriptome have been identified, including
transcription factors (c-Myc, STATs, NFκB, ETV1, and
ERG) and chromatin modifiers (EZH2, bromodomains,
and FOXA1; reviewed in ref. [29]). Notably, the ARdriven genes identified earlier by others as being critical
for prostate cancer progression appear to overlap to some
extent with the AR-related txr genes identified here in
ovarian cancer. Short (CAG)n repeat lengths in AR,
altered expression and activity of AR co-activators, and/
or differential expression of androgen-mediated genes
likely also influence cancer biology and clinical outcome
in ovarian epithelial cancer cells [30]. Thus, AR expression
or its activity through interaction with other factors appears
to be critical for ovarian oncogenesis as well as therapy
efficacy. Identification of AR as a driver for stimulating
drug resistance genes in ovarian cancers, as demonstrated
in this study, should improve our understanding of taxol
sensitivity and resistance in ovarian cancer.
Upregulation of AR and other transcription
factor genes identified were not easily detectable by
transcriptome profiling, possibly due to low expression
levels in txr cells. The AR transcript, for example, was
found to be upregulated 1.5 fold in taxol-resistant cell
lines compared to their taxol-sensitive counterparts based
on the microarray data. However, using q-PCR, the AR
transcript was found to be upregulated more than 160 fold
in taxol-resistant cell lines. The overexpression of AR in
txr cells was confirmed by measurement of its protein
level, an observation which indicated a discrepancy
between microarray and protein expression data. This
discrepancy may be partly explained by the fact that
the activity of transcription factors is usually regulated
by post-translational modifications. For example, AR
activity is inhibited by phosphorylation at serine residues
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by the AKT kinase pathway in a cell-type and cell stagedependent manner [31–35]. This phosphorylation of
AR may lead to Mdm2-mediated protein degradation
in prostate cancer cells [32]. Nevertheless, the nuclear
fraction of AR was significantly reduced following
inhibition of the AKT pathway in ovarian cancer cells
(Fig. 7D), an observation which may be due to another
cellular signal. The discrepancy in the upregulated AR
transcript level in txr cells as determined by microarray
and qPCR also indicates possible pitfalls of the microarray
analysis. Nevertheless, a combined analysis of microarray
data and MetaCore as performed here suggests that
important txr genes like AR may be overlooked by single
biochemical assays.
We found that the transcription factors c-Myc, AP-1,
and STAT3 highly upregulated their target txr genes in
ovarian cancer cells. Crosstalk between cellular pathways
may also explain the potent AR activity in upregulation
of txr genes. The evidence of reciprocal regulation of
c-Myc and AR expression, co-expression in castrationresistant prostate cancer, and ligand-independent AR
activation by c-Myc [36–38] may explain the genomic
instability or metabolic changes observed in prostate
cancer. Furthermore, enhanced AR expression and/or
copy number amplification by increased STAT5 activation
may promote lipid and androgen biosynthesis, as well as
dysregulated cell cycle and DNA synthesis in prostate
cancer cells [36, 39–42]. We also found that AR binds
the Akt-dependent FKBP5 immunophillin, enhancing its
transactivation activity, an observation which suggests that
this protein may represent a key marker of txr in ovarian
cancer cells [28]. Accordingly, enhanced activity of AR
and the transcription factors through crosstalk of their
pathways may cause genomic instability or metabolic
changes via overexpression of target txr genes, resulting
in drug resistance phenotype in ovarian cancer cells.
The fact that AR targets 13 prominent txr genes
was easily revealed by transcriptome profiling due to high
levels of overexpression. In our cell model, the level of
upregulation of these txr genes was more or less unstable
following repeated cell culture passages (data of this study:
GEO database GSE58840; GSE60335 [28]). Some marker
genes like ABCB1 which was overexpressed over 100
fold showed reduced levels of overexpression in txr cells
after prolonged culture, suggesting that the upregulation of
some of these genes may be reversible and epigenetically
regulated [43]. Unlike overexpression of ABCB1 in other
cell systems which occurs through DNA amplification
[4, 5], we noted that overexpression of ABCB1 among
these txr genes in SKOV3/Tx600 cells was controlled at
the transcriptional level. This observation may be explained
by the variable AR activity during cell passage as observed
in prostate cancer cells [33]. AR-mediated gene regulation
of potential txr genes may be less important in advanced
cancer cells in which stable ABCB1 amplification is
dominantly responsible for the multidrug resistance
phenotype. Transcriptional regulation of potential txr genes

by certain key drivers such as AR appears to be important
for the initiation and maintenance of txr.
Further studies of txr gene products and other
interactors, including chromatin modifiers and coregulators, are needed to understand the tuning of AR
function in txr development. The cellular model developed
here will be useful to investigate the molecular events
underlying the development of the txr phenotype. A DNA
microarray analysis revealed over 120 AR-upregulated
genes in OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cells, with the majority
being related to transcription, proliferation, and G-protein
signaling [44]. Since the dataset obtained in the latter study
was not deposited in a public database, our transcriptome
profiling of txr genes in SKOV3 cells is probably the first
available dataset which can serve as a platform for future
studies. More importantly, the strategy presented here
provides the possibility to identify and study the genes
responsible for txr in ovarian cancer.
