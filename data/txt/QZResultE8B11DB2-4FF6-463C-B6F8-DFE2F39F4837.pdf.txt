Guidelines for Patients With
Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract and
present predominantly in middle-aged and older individuals. Historically, the outlook for patients with GISTs was very
poor because of the general lack of efficacy of conventional chemotherapy and the often limited surgical options.
However, the recognition of the role of mutations of the v-kit Hardy/Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog KIT and the platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha gene PDGFRa in the development of GISTs led to the
evaluation of potential antitumor effects of the tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and, more recently, sunitinib. Consequently, these molecularly targeted therapies were introduced into clinical practice, and the outcome for patients
with GISTs improved considerably. In the last few years, the European Society of Medical Oncology, the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network, and the Canadian Advisory Committee on GIST each published a major set of guidelines or practice recommendations for the management of patients with GIST. In the current review, the latest recommendations from each organization are summarized in terms of diagnosis and risk assessment, tumor staging,
surgical and/or drug treatment of primary resectable and recurrent metastatic disease, and patient follow-up and
assessment. In addition, areas of consensus and points of divergence among the guidelines are highlighted along

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal
tract and have characteristic histologic features with either spindle cell, epithelioid, or occasionally pleiomorphic mesenchymal morphology.1-3 GISTs also share phenotypic characteristics with the intestinal pacemaker cells, known as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs), and are thought to arise from a common cell precursor.4 Immunohistochemical analysis has
demonstrated that nearly all GISTs (95%) the express v/kit Hardy/Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
(KIT) protein (cluster of differentiation 117 [CD117]), a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor for stem cell factor.1,5
Other markers identified on immunohistochemistry include ‘‘discovered on GIST 1’’ (DOG1) (present in 87% of
GISTs), protein kinase C theta (80%), CD34 (60%-70%), and smooth muscle actin (30%-40%). Some GISTs,
although a far lower proportion, also demonstrate immunopositivity for S-100 protein (5%), desmin (1%-2%), and
keratin (1%-2%).1,5-8 The characteristic immunohistochemical profile of GISTs also can be used to differentiate them
from smooth muscle tumors (ie, true leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas) and schwannomas.1,5-7
Although GISTs are relatively rare tumors, reporting has increased dramatically since the early 1990s as a result of
increased awareness of this tumor type, thus leading to appropriate pathologic diagnoses. In an analysis of the National
Cancer Institute’s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry, Tran and colleagues identified
1458 patients with GIST who were diagnosed between 1992 and 2000 in the United States and reported an age-adjusted
yearly incidence rate of 0.68 per 100,000 population.9 Population-based studies in other Western countries, including Iceland
and Sweden, have reported an annual incidence of GISTs of approximately 1.1 to 1.5 per 100,000 population.10,11
In recent years, several organizations, including the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and the Canadian Advisory Committee on GISTs, have published guidelines

or practice recommendations for the management of
patients with GISTs.1,12-14 In addition, other guidelines
have been developed with the goal of providing recommendations for GIST management in specific countries
(ie, Switzerland and Japan).15,16 In the current review, we
provide a summary of the latest recommendations from
ESMO, NCCN, and the Canadian Advisory Committee
on GISTs and identify areas of consensus, points of
divergence, and unresolved issues.
Disease Background
Characterization of the causal molecular event responsible
for the neoplastic transformation that results in GISTs
was made possible by the identification of gain-of-function mutations in the KIT proto-oncogene in 1998.17
KIT encodes the KIT protein, which serves as the transmembrane receptor for stem cell factor. Similar but
mutually exclusive mutations also were identified subsequently in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor a
(PDGFRa) gene in a small subset of GISTs.18 Mutations
in KIT and PDGFRa are associated with specific clinicopathologic phenotypes. For example, GISTs with KIT
exon 9 mutations, which are present in approximately
10% to 15% of patients with GIST, frequently are located
in the small bowel, whereas PDGFRa-mutations (approximately 5% of GISTs) are more common in epitheloid
gastric GISTs.8,19 However, not all GISTs harbor mutations of the KIT and PDGFRa genes, and approximately
10% to 15% of GISTs lack such mutations.8,20
Notably, mutations in KIT or PDGFRa cause
constitutive activation of the tyrosine kinase activity of the
KIT and PDGFRa receptors, respectively.18 Recognition
of the importance of KIT and PDGFRa mutations in the
development of GISTs subsequently led to the rationally
based evaluation of the potential antitumor effect of
imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with activity
against KIT receptors and PDGFRa as well as the breakpoint cluster region/v/abl Abelson murine leukemia viral
oncogene homolog (bcr/abl).21
Clinical Presentation
GISTs occur predominantly in middle-aged and older
individuals and rarely in individuals aged <40 years.22 In
an analysis of SEER registry data, the mean age at diagnosis of GIST was 63 years, and it was and 66 to 69 years in
2 European population-based studies.9-11 GISTs occur
with similar frequency in men and women, although
some studies suggest a slight predominance among
men.3,23,24 GISTs commonly present in the stomach

(40%-60%) and small intestine (30%-35%) and present
less frequently in the colon/rectum (5%-16%) and esophagus (1%).2,3,8,23 In patients who have germline KIT
mutations, multifocal proliferations of benign, KIT-positive ICC cells are common. These growths most likely
represent the earliest stage of GIST development.

Diagnosis
According to the ESMO, NCCN, and Canadian guidelines, the accurate diagnosis of GIST should be based
on tumor morphology and immunohistochemistry
(Table 1).1,12-14 Therefore, biopsy or surgical excision of a
nodule is needed for pathologic analysis.
The NCCN and ESMO guidelines indicate that
nodules 2 cm should be excised and biopsied, whereas
the Canadian guidelines indicate that even small GISTs
<1 cm should be excised because of the risk of metastasis.1,12,13 The NCCN guidelines do state that the 2/cm
cutoff is somewhat arbitrary, although reasonable,
and suggest that the proper management of small GISTs
(<2 cm) discovered incidentally remains controversial.1
For smaller nodules (2 cm), the ESMO recognizes
that biopsy is difficult and recommends endoscopic
ultrasound and then follow-up, reserving excision only
for esophageal, gastric, and duodenal nodules that
increase in size. Conversely, the standard approach to
nodules >2 cm is biopsy/excision. Rectal nodules should
be excised regardless of size. When endoscopic assessment
is not possible, excision is the standard approach.13 If
metastatic disease is obvious at presentation, then a biopsy
of a metastatic focus may be sufficient for diagnostic
purposes, although resection of the primary tumor may be
recommended for the prevention of complications or for
the palliation of symptoms.13
The Canadian guidelines provide more specific
recommendations regarding pathologic assessment than the
other guidelines, advising descriptive inclusion of tumor
morphology, cellularity, degree of cytologic atypia, and
tumor size and features of aggressiveness, including necrosis,
invasiveness, marginal status, and mitotic index.12
An immunohistochemical panel that includes KIT,
CD34, smooth muscle actin, S-100 protein, desmin, and
vimentin also is recommended; however, specific recommendations for immunohistochemistry are not listed in
the ESMO or NCCN guidelines.1,12-14 Although most
GISTs are KIT-positive, a small percentage (5%) are
KIT-negative. In such patients and in patients with an
unclear diagnosis, each set of guidelines recommends

mutational analysis for confirming a diagnosis of
GIST.1,12-14
Staging
According to the consensus of a GIST workshop by the
National Institutes of Health in 2001, the risk of aggressive clinical behavior should be stratified on the basis of
tumor size and mitotic count; this approach is recommended in the Canadian guidelines for risk assessment.5,12 However, the ESMO and NCCN guidelines
recognize that a more recent classification that includes
tumor site has better prognostic value (Table 1). This is
based on the observation that gastric GISTs are associated
with a better prognosis than small intestinal or rectal
GISTs of the same size and mitotic count.1,3,13,14 In addition, tumor rupture (whether spontaneous or at the time
of surgical resection) is identified by the ESMO as an
adverse prognostic factor because of its association with
peritoneal contamination.13
According to Lasota and Miettinen, mutational
status may also affect prognosis based on patients with
GIST who were treated before the era of TKI therapy.25
For example, gastric KIT exon 11 deletions are associated
with more aggressive disease than exon 11 substitutions,
although the same is not true for intestinal GISTs. In
addition, tumors with homozygous KIT exon 11 mutations almost always have an aggressive course regardless of
location. It was believed initially that KIT exon 9 mutations conferred aggressive clinical behavior because of
their predominance in the small intestine, but they do not
appear to result in more aggressive tumors than in exon
11 mutations, which are identified mostly in gastric
tumors. In contrast, KIT exon 13 mutations, although
rare, appear to be more aggressive than the average gastric
GIST with other KIT mutations.25 PDGFRa mutations,
as a rule, have a low mitotic rate and confer a favorable
prognosis.25 However, despite these findings, mutational
status, per se is not included in the prognostic assessment
recommended by any of the guidelines.
Imaging is a diagnostic tool that is useful for
confirming, characterizing, and staging GISTs. The ESMO
guidelines indicate that contrast-enhanced computerized
tomography (CT) scanning of the pelvis and abdomen is
the imaging of choice for staging, because it takes into
account the finding that most relapses occur in the peritoneum and liver (Table 1). Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is an alternative and is preferred for the staging of
rectal GISTs.13 The NCCN guidelines recommend
contrast-enhanced CT and, occasionally, MRI as the

imaging modality of choice for initial evaluation and also
recognize that [18F]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose-positron
emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT can be useful in
staging.1,14 According to the Canadian guidelines, the
optimal imaging approach should use a combination of CT
and PET scanning, because it can delineate lesions more
appropriately, particularly in early stage disease. CT
scanning or endoscopic ultrasound is recommended for
small tumors that are identified incidentally.12

Treatment
Resectable GISTs

Surgery is the cornerstone of treatment for primary
resectable GISTs when there is no evidence of metastases
(Table 2).1,12-14 However, despite complete (R0) surgical
resection, some patients are at a high risk of disease
recurrence that will result in an aggressive clinical course.
Five-year recurrence-free and disease-free survival rates of
49% and 65%, respectively, have been reported for
patients undergoing complete resection.26,27

5130

The results from several studies suggest that adjuvant imatinib is useful in some high-risk patients after
surgical resection (Table 3). The phase 3 American
College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG)
Z9001 trial is a large, randomized, double-blind study of
patients with KIT-expressing GISTs 3 cm in size; results
from this study based on 682 treated patients indicated
that adjuvant imatinib 400 mg daily significantly
improved 1-year recurrence-free survival compared with
placebo.28 In the phase 2 ACOSOG Z9000 open-label
study of patients with GISTs at high risk of recurrence
(tumor size 10 cm, tumor rupture, or <5 peritoneal
metastases) who received imatinib 400 mg daily for
1 year; the 3-year survival rate was 97%, and the 3-year
recurrence-free survival rate was 61%—both of which
were superior to similar data reported in historic
controls.29 In an open-label, multicenter trial conducted
in 16 hospitals in China, low rates of recurrence also were
reported in patients with GISTs 5 cm in size or with
mitotic counts 5 per 50 high-power fields (HPF) after
treatment with adjuvant imatinib for 1 year.30 Results

also are awaited with interest from 2 other phase 3 studies
that are evaluating imatinib in the adjuvant setting—
European Organization for Research and Treatment
of Cancer (EORTC) trial 62024 and Scandinavian
Sarcoma Group (SSG) Intergroup trial SSG XVIII/AIO
(Table 3).31,32
Although the ESMO guidelines mention the preliminary ACOSOG Z9001 data, they highlight the
finding that, currently, there are no overall survival data
for imatinib. According to the ESMO, there is no global
consensus on the use of imatinib as adjuvant therapy for
localized GIST, although it may be used for 1 year as adjuvant therapy in patients at high risk of relapse.13 Similarly,
the NCCN guidelines recommend adjuvant imatinib or
observation for patients who are at significant risk of
recurrence after undergoing complete resection.14 The
Canadian guidelines, which were released before the
ACOSOG Z9001 trial results were made public, do not
recommend adjuvant imatinib as standard therapy in this
setting and suggest that high-risk patients should be
considered for inclusion in a clinical trial of adjuvant
imatinib.12 On the basis of the data from the phase 3
ACOSOG Z9001 trial, imatinib (400 mg daily) has been
approved recently by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the adjuvant treatment of adult patients
after complete surgical removal of KIT (CD117)-positive
GISTs.33 After the recent Swiss and European approvals
in this setting, more worldwide approvals are expected.
Recurrent or metastatic disease

In the past, treatment options for patients with
recurrent or metastatic disease were limited because of the
generally poor response of GISTs to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, currently, based on
data from clinical studies that evaluated imatinib in this
patient group, a median survival after diagnosis of 4 to
5 years can be expected (Table 4). Initial results from the
phase 2 B2222 trial indicated that imatinib at doses of
400 mg or 600 mg daily induced sustained objective
responses in patients with advanced GISTs, and similar
results were achieved at the 2 dose levels (partial response
rate, 53.7%; stable disease rate, 27.9%).34 Subsequent
long-term follow-up of data from that study demonstrated
that imatinib extended survival to a median of 57 months,
and similar benefits were achieved in patients who had
objective responses and patients who had stable disease.35
The S0033 and EORTC 62005 studies were 2 phase
3, multicenter, randomized trials that compared standarddose imatinib (400 mg daily) with high-dose imatinib

Cancer

November 15, 2010

(800 mg daily) in patients with advanced or metastatic
GIST, allowing patients who progressed on the standard
dose to cross over to the high dose.36,37 The initial report
from the EORTC 62005 study suggested that high-dose
imatinib prolonged progression-free survival (PFS)
compared with the standard dose; however, on longer follow-up (median, 40 months), PFS for the 2 dose levels
was similar.38 Furthermore, the S0033 study did not identify any significant difference in outcome between the 2
imatinib dose levels.36 MetaGIST was a prospectively
planned meta-analysis designed to determine whether the
imatinib dose influenced outcome in certain patient
subgroups. The analysis was based on 1640 patients who
participated in the S0033 and EORTC 62005 studies.39
After a median follow-up of 45 months, the results
demonstrated that high-dose imatinib provided a small
but significant advantage in PFS compared with the
standard dose in the entire cohort. Overall survival was
identical with the 2 doses. However, in the subset of
patients who had KIT exon 9 mutations, high-dose
imatinib conferred a significantly substantial benefit in
terms of PFS compared with the standard dose along with
a trend toward improved overall survival in this subgroup
with the 800/mg daily dose.39
The ESMO, NCCN, and Canadian guidelines all
recognize that imatinib is the standard of care for patients
with recurrent, unresectable, and metastatic GISTs. The
ESMO recommends using imatinib at a dose of 400 mg
daily except in patients who have KIT exon 9 mutations,
for whom the recommended starting dose is 800 mg daily.
Patients who have tumor progression on 400 mg
daily should have their imatinib dose increased to 800 mg
daily, which may be particularly useful in patients who
have exon 9 mutations.13
The NCCN guidelines also recommend prescribing
imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily and increasing the
starting dose to 800 mg daily in patients with exon 9
mutations. Dose escalation to 800 mg daily is considered
appropriate for patients who have disease progression on
the standard dose.14 The Canadian guidelines specify
prescription of imatinib at a standard dose of 400 mg
daily but suggest considering a starting dose of 800 mg
daily for patients who have KIT exon 9 mutations or the
PDGFRa D842V mutation (replacement of valine [V] for
aspartic acid [D] at amino acid 842 of PDGFRa) for
recurrent or metastatic disease. They also suggest that
dose escalation to 800 mg daily should be considered in
previous responders who have progression or who develop
secondary resistance.12

Neoadjuvant therapy

Surgical resection may become feasible in some
patients with previously unresectable GISTs after treatment with imatinib. This is highlighted by several
reported series that illustrate experience with neoadjuvant
imatinib therapy at various medical centers.40-46 For
example, Andtbacka and colleagues reported that patients
with recurrent or metastatic GIST who had a partial radiographic tumor response to neoadjuvant imatinib therapy
(n ¼ 11) had a significantly higher complete resection rate
compared with patients who had progressive disease
(n ¼ 24; resection rate, 91% vs 4%; P < .001).40
Neoadjuvant imatinib is recommended in the
ESMO guidelines in patients for whom R0 surgery is not
feasible and for those patients who are candidates for less
mutilating cytoreductive surgery.13 The NCCN guidelines recommend neoadjuvant imatinib for marginally

5132

resectable tumors and for resectable GISTs with a risk of
significant morbidity.14 According to the Canadian
guidelines, neoadjuvant imatinib should be considered if
surgery could result in significant morbidity or loss of
organ function, and subsequent surgery may be considered 4 months to 12 months later after maximal tumor
shrinkage.12
Second-Line Treatment of Advanced GISTs

After disease progression on high-dose imatinib or
the development of imatinib intolerance, there is evidence
to suggest that switching to the TKI sunitinib may be
warranted. Sunitinib has activity against KIT and
PDGFRa as well as other pathways that may be relevant
in GIST, such as vascular endothelial growth factor receptor.47,48 In a phase 3 randomized trial, sunitinib administered at a dose of 50 mg daily in a 4-week/on/2-week/off

Cancer

Updated Treatment Guidelines for GIST/Blay et al

cycle significantly prolonged the time to progression compared with placebo in patients with advanced GISTs who
were resistant or intolerant to imatinib (27.3 weeks vs 6.4
weeks; P < .0001).49 Continuous daily dosing with sunitinib 37.5 mg daily reportedly is active and compares
favorably with the 4-week/on/2-week/off cycle.50 Sunitinib also appears to be active against secondary mutations
that affect the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site
but not against secondary mutations that affect the KIT
activation loop, both of which are resistant to imatinib.51,52 On the basis of these findings, sunitinib was
approved by the FDA in 2006 for the second-line treatment of patients with GISTs whose disease has progressed
or who are unable to tolerate treatment with imatinib.53
Nilotinib is a second-generation TKI that achieves
higher intracellular concentrations in GISTs than imatinib, suggesting that it has potential activity in certain imatinib-resistant cell lines.54 In support of this, nilotinib
alone or in combination with imatinib demonstrated
promising clinical activity in patients with advanced
GISTs who had progressed on imatinib in a phase 1
study.55 Recently, a phase 3 registrational trial of thirdline nilotinib in patients with GIST who failed both
imatinib and sunitinib was completed.56 In that trial,
248 patients were randomized to receive either nilotinib
(400 mg twice daily) or best supportive care, which may
or may not have included a TKI of the investigator’s
choice; patients were allowed to cross over to nilotinib
upon progression. Also, a phase 3 randomized trial comparing nilotinib 800 mg daily with imatinib 800 mg daily
for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced and/
or metastatic GISTs has been initiated.57 Some other
agents that are under investigation for the treatment of
GISTs include masitinib, dasatinib, and sorafenib.
Masitinib, a TKI against wild/type c-KIT and its
activated forms—PDGFRa, PDGFRb, Lyn kinase/focal
adhesion kinase, and fibroblast growth factor receptor
3—has been evaluated in a phase 1 dose-escalation
study in patients with GISTs.58 The maximum
tolerated dose was not reached in that study; however,
12 mg/kg daily was considered the maximal recommended dose in long-term treatment, and masitinib
exhibited clinical activity.59 A phase 2 trial of singleagent masitinib in imatinib-naive patients who have
inoperable, locally advanced, or metastatic GIST is
underway. Preliminary results have produced a disease
control rate of 97%, a median PFS of 44 months, a
2-year PFS rate of 60%, a 3-year overall survival rate of
90%, and fairly well tolerated side effects.

Cancer

November 15, 2010

With respect to the second-line treatment of GISTs,
both the ESMO and NCCN guidelines support the continued use of imatinib at the same dose or at an increased
dose, as tolerated, in patients with limited progressive
disease.13,14 After failure on imatinib, both the ESMO
and the NCCN support the use of sunitinib in patients
who progress on imatinib or who are intolerant to
imatinib and suggest that, after failure, patients should be
considered for a clinical trial.13,14 In contrast, the
Canadian guidelines do not make any specific recommendations after imatinib failure, suggesting consideration of
an experimental regimen in a clinical trial. Perhaps this
is because sunitinib was approved for the treatment of
GIST only in 2006.12
Follow-Up: Response to Therapy
and Monitoring
The optimal management of GISTs requires a multimodality approach with contributions from medical
oncologists, surgical oncologists, radiologists, and pathologists—both during the initial management and during
follow-up.1 In terms of follow-up after surgical resection
of the primary tumor, patients should be monitored for
disease recurrence or metastatic disease at periodic intervals. The ESMO does not provide specific recommendations for follow-up after resection—noting that follow-up
schedules differ by institution—but the ESMO does
suggest that the risk assessment performed after surgery
may help determine the optimal frequency of follow-up
monitoring.13 Very/low-risk tumors may not warrant
routine follow-up.13 The NCCN guidelines recommend
follow-up by abdominal/pelvic CT scans every 3 to 6
months but suggest that less frequent follow-up is appropriate for patients with very/low-risk disease.14 A follow-up
CT scan every 3 to 6 months for a minimum of 5 years after
resection is recommended in the Canadian guidelines.12
For those patients who have advanced disease, regular monitoring should be undertaken to assess response to
treatment with imatinib and subsequent lines of therapy.
Significantly, response assessments based solely on
changes in tumor size, such as Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or the Southwest Oncology Group criteria, are recognized now as insufficient for
evaluating response to TKIs, because stable disease also
should be considered a sign of tumor efficacy in these
patients.60,61 The criteria reported by Choi and colleagues
include an evaluation of the density of the metastases in
addition to an evaluation of tumor size, and these criteria
will need to be integrated into subsequent clinical trials.60

5133

Review Article

On CT scans, tumors that respond to imatinib
generally have the disappearance of enhancing nodules
and tumor vessels, increased tumor homogeneity, and
decreased tumor density irrespective of changes in tumor
size. These changes may reflect ongoing tumor necrosis,
intratumoral hemorrhage, or myxoid degeneration.60
Furthermore, Choi and colleagues demonstrated that
changes in tumor size and density were correlated with
treatment responses on FDG-PET images; and, based on
these findings, they proposed new criteria for assessing
treatment responses according to changes in tumor size or
density.60,62 According to these criteria, a partial response
is defined as a decrease in tumor size 10% or a decrease
in tumor density 15% without any new lesions or
obvious progression of nonmeasurable lesions.62 Moreover, at 2 months, the Choi criteria were able to distinguish time to progression and disease-specific survival
between good and poor responders, whereas RECIST
were not.62,63
For patients who are active treatment for advanced
GISTs, the ESMO guidelines recommend considering
both tumor size and density on CT scans or consistent
changes on MRI studies in the response assessment.
FDG-PET is recommended when an early response to
treatment is needed and in patients for whom the response
assessment by CT is unclear.13 According to the NCCN
guidelines, follow-up monitoring by CT with or without
PET should be undertaken within 3 months of initiating
TKI therapy. The NCCN also recognizes the benefit of
the Choi criteria over RECIST but indicates that further
studies are needed to validate this approach.1,14 In the
Canadian guidelines, CT and FDG-PET studies every
3 months are recommended as the preferred methods for
assessing treatment responses and should be performed
using RECIST in combination with qualitative changes
in tumor characteristics (eg, density) and morphology.12
There also is evidence to indicate that the clinical
benefit of imatinib in patients with progressive GISTs,
according to RECIST or the Choi criteria, correlates with
exposure to adequate drug blood levels, suggesting that
monitoring blood levels may be useful in patients with
suboptimal response. For example, in the B2222 study,
measurement of trough blood levels after 1 month of
imatinib therapy revealed a statistically significant lower
median time to progression in patients with the lowest
quartile of trough imatinib levels compared with other
quartiles.64 However, despite these findings, assessment
of imatinib blood levels has yet to be incorporated into
any of the guidelines.

5134

Treatment compliance is important for achieving
and maintaining responses and, thus, should be verified in
all patients who do not have suboptimal responses. The
BFR14 study demonstrated that patients who interrupted
imatinib after 1 or 3 years had high rates of disease recurrence compared with patients who continued imatinib
therapy without interruption.65-67 After 1 year of tumor
control on imatinib at 400 mg daily, dose interruption
resulted in disease progression in 85% of patients compared with 31% of patients who were receiving continuous therapy.67 Similarly, among patients who were
free from progression on imatinib 400 mg daily for
3 years, subsequent interruption of therapy was associated with a 1-year PFS rate of 32% compared with
92% among patients who were receiving continuous
imatinib therapy.67 In this respect, all 3 sets of guidelines
recommend the administration of imatinib therapy indefinitely until there is evidence of disease progression.
In conclusion, GISTs are relatively rare tumors that
require a multimodal approach to management. Three
sets of major guidelines on the management of GISTs
have been published over the last several years; and,
although some points of divergence do exist, the guidelines offer similar recommendations in a variety of areas.
It should be noted, however, that as this review is being
written, the 2009 Canadian GIST guidelines are being
finalized; thus, recommendations that have been discussed
herein ultimately may change.
With respect to the diagnosis of GISTs, the guidelines agree that immunohistochemistry and morphology
play crucial roles in the use of mutational analysis if the
diagnosis is unclear. Surgery remains the mainstay of
treatment and is recommended for primary resectable
disease (tumors 2 cm); this should be followed by stratification for risk from an aggressive clinical course based
on tumor size, mitotic count, and location. It is noteworthy that the introduction of imatinib into clinical
practice has significantly improved the clinical outcome
of patients with metastatic or advanced GIST and is
reflected in the guideline recommendations, which
endorse imatinib at a dose of 400 mg daily as first-line
therapy for patients with recurrent and metastatic GISTs
and the continuation of therapy without interruption
until disease progression. Dose escalation to 800 mg daily
is recommended on disease progression.
Despite the publication of comprehensive guidelines
on the management of patients with GISTs, several issues
remain unresolved. These include the need for better definition of the role of mutational status in risk stratification;

Cancer

Updated Treatment Guidelines for GIST/Blay et al

however, currently, mutational status is not included in
the risk stratification in any guidelines. Indeed, the prognostic implication of mutations may require re-evaluation
in the era of TKI therapy, because the likelihood of
response to currently available therapies may dramatically
change the prognosis from that observed before the standard use of TKIs. Furthermore, although the guidelines
(NCCN and ESMO) agree that, in patients with localized
GIST, adjuvant imatinib can be used for up to 1 year after
resection in high-risk patients, additional evidence is
needed to support the role of imatinib in the adjuvant
setting—for example, defining which patient subgroups
warrant such treatment.
Case series offer supportive evidence for the use of
neoadjuvant imatinib in patients with unresectable
disease. Patients may become surgical candidates when
they respond to imatinib, but clinical studies still are
needed to establish the role of neoadjuvant therapy and to
identify appropriate patient characteristics. Similarly, second-line treatment after imatinib needs to be clarified;
because, although sunitinib currently is approved in this
setting, several other options are being evaluated in clinical studies. It is noteworthy that a more accurate and
earlier assessment of response to treatment should help to
address many of the unresolved issues relating to the
management of patients with GISTs. In this respect, the
Choi criteria offer promise in assessing treatment
responses to the TKIs imatinib and sunitinib, and further
studies are needed urgently to validate these criteria and to
demonstrate their value in routine clinical practice.
