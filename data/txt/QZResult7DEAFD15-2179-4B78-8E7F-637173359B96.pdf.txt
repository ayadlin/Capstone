Summary
Persistent activation of Stat3 is oncogenic and is prevalent in a wide variety of human cancers.
Chronic cytokine stimulation is associated with Stat3 activation in some tumors, implicating cytokine
receptor-associated Jak family kinases. Using Jak2 inhibitors, we demonstrate a central role of Jaks
in modulating basal and cytokine-induced Stat3 activation in human solid tumor cell lines. Inhibition
of Jak2 activity is associated with abrogation of Stat3 nuclear translocation and tumorigenesis. The
Jak2 inhibitor, AZD1480, suppresses the growth of human solid tumor xenografts harboring
persistent Stat3 activity. We demonstrate the essential role of Stat3 downstream of Jaks by inhibition
of tumor growth using shRNA targeting Stat3. Our data support a key role of Jak kinase activity in
Stat3-dependent tumorigenesis.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription (Stat) proteins comprise a family of
transcription factors that mediate cytokine and growth factor responses (Akira et al., 1994;
Darnell, 1997; Darnell et al., 1994). Persistent activation of Stat3 is oncogenic (Yu and Jove,
2004), and is prevalent in a wide variety of human cancers, including breast, prostate, head
and neck, and ovarian cancers, among other solid and hematologic tumors (Bromberg et al.,
1999; Catlett-Falcone et al., 1999; Dhir et al., 2002; Garcia et al., 2001; Grandis et al., 2000;

of genes that encode anti-apoptotic proteins, cell cycle regulators, and angiogenic factors
(Bowman et al., 2001; Bowman et al., 2000; Grandis et al., 2000; Niu et al., 2002b).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Stat3 is activated by phosphorylation of Tyr705, promoting cytosolic dimerization, nuclear
translocation and DNA binding (Darnell et al., 1994). Stat activation by cytokines is mediated
through the Janus family kinases (Jak) which include four family members, Jak1, Jak2, Jak3
and Tyk2 (Schindler and Darnell, 1995). Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 are ubiquitously expressed,
whereas expression of Jak3 is primarily restricted to the lymphoid lineage (Johnston et al.,
1994). Jak family kinases associate with the large hematopoietin sub-family of cytokine
receptors that lack intrinsic kinase activity, and are dependent on Jak catalytic activity for signal
transduction (Leaman et al., 1996). In addition, Stat3 can be phosphorylated by activated
growth factor receptors such as c-MET and EGFR (Boccaccio et al., 1998; Quesnelle et al.,
2007). Src family kinases have also been implicated in Stat3 activation (Bowman et al.,
2000).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A growing body of evidence has documented an important role for autocrine and/or paracrine
cytokine loops in driving aberrant activation of Stat3 in human cancer. In particular,
interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling has been implicated in tumorigenesis (Catlett-Falcone et al.,
1999; Grivennikov et al., 2009; Hodge et al., 2005; Hong et al., 2007). Recent studies in breast
(Berishaj et al., 2007), lung (Gao et al., 2007) and diffuse large B cell lymphoma (Lam et al.,
2008) cancer cell lines have demonstrated a central role of Jak family kinases in mediating
IL-6 signaling in these cells. These observations provide a molecular basis for constitutive
Stat3 activation in solid tumor types, and highlights Jaks as potential targets for cancer therapy.
The recent identification of an acquired Jak2 mutation in myeloproliferative neoplasms has led
to the rapid development of selective Jak2 small-molecule inhibitors (Levine and Gilliland,
2008; Morgan and Gilliland, 2008). These reagents provide a means of testing the involvement
of Jaks in Stat3 dependent tumorigenesis. We have used the Jak2 inhibitors AZ960 (Gozgit et
al., 2008) and AZD1480 to determine whether Jak2 is a central mediator of constitutive and
inducible Stat3 activation in tumor cells, and if inhibition of this signaling axis could suppress
the growth of solid tumor xenografts.

Results
In vitro Characterization of AZD1480

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The pyrazolyl pyrimidine AZD1480 is a potent ATP competitive inhibitor of Jak2 kinase, with
an inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.26 nM (Figure 1A; Figure S1). To evaluate Jak family
selectivity of AZD1480, Jak1, 2 and 3 enzymatic assays were carried out at Km levels of ATP
and 5 mM ATP, the high end of ATP concentrations in cells (Figure 1B). AZD1480
demonstrated significant Jak2 selectivity over Jak3, in particular at high ATP concentrations
and marginal selectivity over Jak1 at Km ATP.
To evaluate the cellular selectivity of AZD1480 between the Jak family of kinases, a panel of
isogenic Ba/F3 cell lines driven by the JH1 catalytic domains of Jak1, Jak2, Jak3 or Tyk2 fused
to the oligomerization domain of TEL were tested (Gozgit et al., 2008; Lacronique et al.,
2000). AZD1480 inhibited the phosphorylation of Stat5 with an IC50 of 46 nM in TEL-Jak2
cells, whereas little or no inhibition of STAT5 phosphorylation was observed in the TEL-Jak3,
TEL-ak1, or TEL-Tyk2 cells at or below 1 µM AZD1480 (Figure 1C). In these same cells,
AZD1480 potently inhibited the growth of the TEL-Jak2 cell line with a GI50 of 60 nM.
Proliferation of Ba/F3 cell lines bearing the other Jak family members was inhibited at much
higher GI50 values in line with the selectivity observed in enzyme and/or pStat5 assays (Figure
1D).

To assess the overall kinase selectivity, AZD1480 was evaluated against a panel of 82 kinases
(Millipore Corporation, Charlottesville, VA) at or near Km for ATP with three drug
concentrations (0.01, 0.10 and 1.0 µM). The kinases represent the diversity of the kinome based
on kinase binding site similarity and the gatekeeper residue, a major determinant of small
molecule kinase selectivity. 11/82 kinases, including Jak2, were inhibited by greater than 50%
at 0.10 µM (Figure S2).
Jaks are central mediators of Stat3 signaling in solid tumor cells
Screening of a panel of cell lines manifesting constitutive or inducible Stat3 tyrosyl
phosphorylation demonstrated that in virtually all (17/18) of the lines pStat3Tyr705 was
dependent on Jak kinase activity (Figure 2A and B). Stat3 is activated downstream of Src family
kinases and activated growth factor receptors, therefore the impact of Src, EGFR and Met
kinase inhibitors was also tested. Notably, neither inhibition of Src (15 cell lines tested) nor
EGFR (7 lines tested) resulted in modulation of pStat3Tyr705 in this panel of cell lines, despite
complete inhibition of pSrc and pEGFR (Figure S3). Only c-Met inhibition in the gastric cell
line MKN45 showed Jak2-independent inhibition of pStat3Tyr705. These data indicate a central
role of Jak family kinases in mediating Stat3 activation in solid tumor cell lines.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further investigate the role of Jak kinases in modulating Stat3 activity we utilized a murine
embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cell line lacking endogenous Stat3 expression and stably
expressing a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-Stat3 fusion protein (MEF-Stat3-YFP).
AZD1480 inhibited Jak2 autophosphorylation in MEF-tat3-YFP cells when stimulated with
Oncostatin M (OSM), a member of the IL-6 cytokine family (Hintzen et al., 2008) (Figure 3A).
Jak1 activity was also assessed as it is involved in IL-6 stimulated Stat3 activity (Guschin et
al., 1995). AZD1480 had no effect on Jak1 autophosphorylation at doses required to inhibit
Stat3 phosphorylation (0.5 µM; Figure 3A). Dose-dependent inhibition of Stat3 nuclear
translocation was detected with confocal microscopy (Figure 3B) that correlated with inhibition
of Jak2 and Stat3 phosphorylation (Figure 3A). The images obtained from confocal microscopy
were quantified as described in Experimental Procedures, revealing an IC50 for the inhibition
of Stat3 nuclear translocation of approximately 350 nM (Figure 3C).
Jak2 contributes to Stat3 mediated oncogenesis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MEF-Stat3-YFP cells were employed as a model of Stat3-mediated oncogenesis to address
whether Jak2 inhibition can suppress the growth of a Stat3 dependent tumor. MEF-Stat3-YFP
cells have been transformed by the Stat3-YFP fusion construct as evidenced by their ability to
form tumors following subcutaneous implantation in athymic mice, whereas the parental
Stat3−/− MEF cells were unable to grow in vivo (Figure 4A). Following once daily treatment
of tumor-bearing mice with 50 mg/kg AZD1480 (p.o.), the growth of MEF-Stat3-YFP tumors
were inhibited 58% (p = 0.001, n=6), relative to vehicle-treated control cohort (Figure 4B).
Stat3 tyrosyl phosphorylation was determined in lysates derived from tumors 2 h post treatment
with AZD1480. While constitutive Stat3 activity was found in the vehicle treated tumors,
pStat3Tyr705 was abolished in tumors that were treated with AZD1480 (Figure 4C).
Constitutive phosphorylation of Stat3 in the xenograft setting, but not under routine cell culture
conditions (Figure 3A), indicates activation of the pathway likely by the tumor microenvironment.
Intravital multiphoton laser microscopy was performed on mice bearing MEF-Stat3-YFP
tumors to visualize Stat3 subcellular localization in the tumors. MEF-Stat3-YFP tumors were
found to have a predominance of nuclear localized Stat3 coinciding with the constitutive
expression of pStat3Tyr705 observed by Western blot (Figure 4D). Treatment of MEF-Stat3YFP tumors with AZD1480 resulted in inhibition of Stat3 nuclear translocation in vivo,

Jak2 mediates IL-6 dependent survival of androgen independent prostate cancer cells
The LnCaP subline LN-17 express constitutive Stat3 activity as a consequence of stable
expression of an exogenous IL-6 gene and endogenous expression of the IL-6R (Lee et al.,
2003; Lou et al., 2000). The resulting IL-6 autocrine loop allows LN-17 cells to survive under
androgen deprivation conditions. LN-17 cells were treated with AZD1480 to determine
whether Jak2 blockade can abrogate IL-6 dependent survival. Dose-dependent inhibition of
pStat3Tyr705 (Figure 5A) and Stat3 DNA binding activity (Figure 5B) was observed in response
to the addition of AZD1480, as was a loss of viability (Figure 5C). The loss of viability was
associated with a dose-dependent increase in the apoptotic markers Annexin V (Figure 5D)
and PARP cleavage (85kD fragment) (Figure 5E). To confirm the Jak2 dependency of Stat3
signaling in these cells, the effect of two siRNAs directed against Jak2 were tested to determine
if they could inhibit Stat3 tyrosine phosphorylation. Reduction of Jak2 protein expression by
siRNAs 1 and 2 inhibited Stat3 signaling compared to a non-silencing control siRNA (Figure
5F).
AZD1480 suppresses the growth of tumors with constitutive Stat3 activity

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The LN-17 subline was incapable of growth in mice, thus we were unable to assess the in
vivo efficacy of Jak2 inhibition in this model. To determine whether AZD1480 could impact
the growth of human tumors, we turned to solid tumor xenograft lines that displayed
constitutive Stat3 activation and an IL-6 autocrine loop. The cancer cell lines DU145 (prostate),
MDAH2774 (ovarian) and MDA-MB-468 (breast) were chosen. DU145 and MDA-MB-468
express IL-6 autocrine loops (Berishaj et al., 2007; Okamoto et al., 1997), and we have
determined that MDAH2774 cells both secrete IL-6 and express IL-6R (Figure 6A).
Constitutive pStat3Tyr705 was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by AZD1480 in all three
cell lines (Figure 6B). Significant inhibition of pStat3Tyr705 is observed at 0.1 µM drug, and
near ablation of signal at 0.25 –0.5 µM. These cell lines show greater sensitivity to inhibition
of Stat3 phosphorylation by AZD1480 than does the MEF-Stat3-YFP line (Figure 3A), perhaps
reflecting Stat3 overexpression in the transfected MEF cells. In all three lines, exogenous
addition of IL-6 induced phosphorylation of Stat3Tyr705 (Figure 6C), which was inhibited
following treatment with AZD1480.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We transfected siRNAs directed against Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 to identify the Jak family kinase
primarily responsible for Stat3 activation in MDAH2774 cells. While we observed successful
inhibition of Jak1, Jak2, and Tyk2 protein expression with the siRNAs, only reduction of Jak1
protein suppressed Stat3 phosphorylation compared to the GAPDH negative control siRNA
(Figure 6D).
AZD1480 did not inhibit in vitro growth of DU145, MDAH2774, and MDA-MB-468 cells at
doses that abrogated Stat3 tyrosyl phosphorylation (not shown). In a 72 h viability assay,
GI50 values for the three lines ranged from 2.4 to 5.4 uM, indicating that under standard cell
culture conditions, Jak2/Stat3 signaling was not essential for survival, and growth inhibition
likely reflects off-target activities manifested at the high drug levels. Similar observations are
made for the panel of solid tumor cell lines shown in Figure 1B. To assess the impact of Jak
inhibition on in vivo tumor growth, mice bearing DU145 and MDA-MB-468 tumors were
treated once daily with AZD1480. In this context, AZD1480 demonstrated significant tumor
growth inhibition of DU145 (81% growth inhibition, p < 0.001, n=7) and MDA-MB-468
(111% growth inhibition, p < 0.001, n=7) xenografts, relative to vehicle treated cohorts (Figure
7A).

An alternative dosing schedule and dose levels were tested in mice bearing MDAH2774
xenografts. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with 1, 10 and 30 mg/kg AZD1480 twice daily
(BID). A dose-dependent reduction in tumor growth was observed, with comparable tumor
growth inhibition observed at 10 mg/kg twice daily (71% growth inhibition, p < 0.001, n=10)
to that observed at 50 mg/kg once daily. Upon twice daily dosing with 30 mg/kg AZD1480
(Figure 7A) tumor regression was observed (139% growth inhibition, p < 0.001, n=10). No
lethal toxicity or weight loss was observed at the doses of AZD1480 spanning 26 days of dosing
(Figure S4). Given the well established role of Jak family kinases in hematopoiesis, and
particularly of Jak2 in erythropoiesis, we evaluated red and white blood cell counts in mice
treated with AZD1480. No significant changes in white blood cell counts occurred following
10 days of treatment at 10 or 30 mg/kg BID. Over the same time period red blood cell counts
decreased approximately 13% in response to 30 mg/kg BID AZD1480, while no changes were
observed at 10 mg/kg BID (Figure S5).
Tumor growth inhibition correlates with inhibition of constitutive Stat3 signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Complete inhibition of pStat3Tyr705 was observed in tumor lysates prepared from xenografts
harvested 2 h post AZD1480 treatment (Figure 7B). More detailed kinetic analysis of tumor
lysates from MDAH2774 xenograft-bearing mice 2, 6, 10 and 16 h after a single 30 mg/kg
dose of AZD1480 demonstrated that expression of pStat3Tyr705 begins to recover by 6–10 h
after drug treatment and appears to be fully recovered by 16 h (Figure 7B).
Immunohistochemical analysis of tumor sections demonstrated that pStat3Tyr705, and its
inhibition by AZD1480, was evident not only in tumor cells, but also in adjacent mouse tumor
stroma (Figure S6)
IL-6 can also stimulate the ERK and PI3K pathways (Culig et al., 2005), therefore we examined
whether Jak inhibition was modulating these signaling pathways. No significant change in
expression of p44/42 pMAPK and pAKTSer473 was detected in tumors treated with AZD1480
compared to control animals (Figure 7B). Furthermore, since AZD1480 inhibited Aurora A
enzyme activity in the kinase panel (Figure S2), xenograft tumor sections were examined for
evidence of mitotic block, the phenotypic endpoint of Aurora A inhibition (Manfredi et al,
2007), by staining for the mitotic marker pHisH3. No modulation of pHisH3 staining was
observed in MDAH2774 xenografts treated with 30 mg/kg AZD1480 for up to 16h post-dose
(Figure S7).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To confirm that suppression of tumor growth observed upon AZD1480 treatment was due to
inhibition of Stat3 signaling, we created MDA-MB-468 cells stably expressing either Stat3
shRNA or vector alone. MDA-MB-468 cells expressing Stat3 shRNA displayed significant
decreases in both total Stat3 and pStat3Tyr705 in culture compared to empty vector or nonsilencing control shRNA expressing cells (Figure 8A and 8C). In vitro evaluation of the stably
infected MDA-MB-468 cells revealed no significant change in the growth of Stat3 shRNA
expressing compared to empty vector cells (data not shown). However, the growth of MDAMB-468 tumors expressing Stat3 shRNAs were significantly impaired compared to tumors
expressing the empty vector or non-silencing shRNA (Figure 8B and 8D).
The converse experiment to inhibiting Stat3 expression is over-expression of an activated Stat3
mutant whose activity is independent of tyrosine phosphorylation. To confirm that tumor
growth inhibition observed upon treatment with AZD1480 was due to inhibition of Stat3
signaling, we tested whether AZD1480 could inhibit the growth of 786-0 renal cell carcinoma
xenografts expressing a constitutively-active Stat3 mutant, Stat3C (Bromberg et al., 1999).
While 786-0 xenografts expressing Stat3C exhibited no growth inhibition, the growth of vector
control xenografts were inhibited following 41 d of treatment with 50 mg/kg AZD1480 when
compared to vehicle treated xenografts (48 % growth inhibition, p = 0.038, n = 10), (Figure
S8). Moreover, decreased apoptosis was observed post-treatment with AZD1480 in Stat3C

expressing xenografts compared to treated control cells (Figure S8). These data provide further
evidence that tumor growth inhibition by AZD1480 is due at least in part to inhibition of Stat3
signaling.

Discussion
Persistent Stat3 activation is prevalent in many types of human cancers, and contributes to
tumor progression. While direct inhibition of transcription factors with small-molecule
inhibitors has proven challenging, targeting of upstream activating kinases offers a
pharmaceutically viable alternative. The mechanism of persistent Stat3 activation in cancer
tissues and cell lines has been attributed to phosphorylation by Jak and Src family kinases, as
well as activated receptor tyrosine kinases including EGFR (Boccaccio et al., 1998; Bowman
et al., 2000; Lo et al., 2007; Quesnelle et al., 2007). The availability of Jak2 inhibitors such as
AZD1480 make it possible to test the impact of Jak inhibition on Stat3 activation in solid tumor
cell lines. In a panel of cell lines displaying constitutive Stat3 activation, we found that almost
all cell lines were dependent on Jak kinase activity for Stat3 activation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In none of the cell lines tested was tyrosyl phosphorylation of Stat3 suppressed by inhibition
of Src activity, and in only one cell line was Stat3 found to be phosphorylated downstream of
a receptor tyrosine kinase, in this case c-Met. While previous reports have indicated a role for
Src family kinases and growth factor receptors such as EGFR in phosphorylation of Stat3, it
is likely that these receptor and non-receptor tyrosine kinases cooperate with Jak family kinases
to activate Stat3 (Gao et al., 2007; Garcia et al., 2001; Niu et al., 2002a; Wang et al., 2000; Xi
et al., 2003). Thus, depending on the cellular context, other non-receptor and receptor tyrosine
kinases may indirectly activate Stat3 through Jak family kinases. Importantly, our data
demonstrate that Jak family kinases are essential for Stat3 activation. These observations
indicate that Jak-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Stat3 is a common mechanism in
a majority of human cancer cell lines.
Inhibition of Stat3 phosphorylation by AZD1480 in MEF-Stat3-YFP cells correlates with dosedependent inhibition of Stat3 nuclear translocation and Stat3-dependent tumor growth.
Reconstitution of Stat3 expression in MEF cells resulted in tumor growth, in contrast to the
parental Stat3-null cells, confirming the essential role of Stat3 in this tumor model. In vivo
activation of Stat3 appears to be primarily mediated by Jak2, since treatment of tumor-bearing
mice with AZD1480 resulted in inhibition of Stat3 activation and tumor growth. We also
demonstrate Stat3 subcellular localization in MEF-Stat3-YFP tumors by intravital multiphoton
laser microscopy.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In cancer cell lines and tissues, there is evidence for constitutive activation of Stat3 through
chronic cytokine stimulation upon the establishment of autocrine or paracrine loops, often
involving IL-6 (Culig et al., 2005; Grivennikov and Karin, 2008; Rabinovich et al., 2007). The
IL-6R shares the common gp130 subunit that signals through receptor-associated Jak family
kinases. We have shown, in multiple cell lines, that IL-6-driven stimulation of Stat3 tyrosyl
phosphorylation can be completely blocked by AZD1480. IL-6 is known to signal through
Jak1, Jak2 and Tyk2, with Jak1 reported to play an essential role (Guschin et al., 1995). We
observed only slight inhibition of pJak1Tyr1007/1008 at drug concentrations sufficient to inhibit
pStat3Tyr705 in MEF-STAT3-YFP cells stimulated by the IL-6 family cytokine OSM.
However, given the comparable potency of AZD1480 for Jak1 at high ATP concentrations in
vitro, and that siRNA targeting Jak1 led to a reduction of Stat3 activity in tumor cells, we
cannot rule out the possibility that inhibition of pStat3Tyr705 might be dependent on inhibition
of both Jak1 and Jak2 activity.

DU145, MDA-MB-468, and MDAH2774 express IL-6 autocrine loops (Berishaj et al., 2007;
Okamoto et al., 1997) and their tumorigenesis was inhibited upon treatment with AZD1480.
Following once daily treatment with 50 mg/kg of AZD1480, growth of DU145 and MDAMB-468 xenografts were inhibited. Comparable tumor growth inhibition was seen in
MDAH2774 xenografts dosed twice daily at 10 mg/kg. Increasing the twice-daily dosing level
to 30 mg/kg resulted in tumor regression. We found Jak inhibition to be well tolerated at the
doses and schedules described. However, given the role of Jak family kinases in hematopoiesis,
more prolonged or intensive treatment may require optimization of dose and/or schedule to
achieve efficacy with manageable impact on hematopoiesis.
Pharmacodynamic analysis of Stat3 phosphorylation demonstrated significant inhibition of
pStat3 for >10 h after a single dose of 30 mg/kg AZD1480. Coupled with the anti-tumor
efficacy data, this suggests that optimal tumor growth inhibition correlates with sustained Stat3
pathway signaling inhibition over a 24 h period. Reduction of Stat3 expression with shRNA
in MDA-MB-468 xenografts significantly inhibited tumor growth. Introduction of a
constitutively-active Stat3C mutant into 786-0 xenografts caused these tumors to become
resistant to AZD1480 treatment. These findings further support the conclusion that tumor
growth inhibition observed upon treatment with AZD1480 is dependent at least in part on
inhibition of Stat3 signaling.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Notably, no inhibition of growth was observed in cell culture for any of the xenograft cell lines
at doses of AZD1480 that maximally inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation. In addition, shRNAmediated knockdown of Stat3 did not significantly affect the growth of MDA-MB-468 cells
in vitro. One possibility for this discrepancy is that Jak/Stat signaling is not required for growth
in standard two-dimensional cell culture in which cells are exposed to the multitude of growth
factors present in serum. In the in vivo setting, the increased complexity of the tumor
microenvironment could provide a context in which Jak/Stat activity is essential for survival.
This could manifest as a tumor autonomous dependence on Jak/Stat signaling, and/or a
dependence on Jak/Stat signaling in the tumor microenvironment. Using IHC analysis of tumor
xenografts, we have demonstrated activation of Stat3 in the tumor stroma, in addition to tumor
cells, and inhibition of both signals following treatment with AZD1480. These observations
raise the possibility that tumor growth inhibition may be mediated, at least in part, by blockade
of stromal Stat3 activity.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Aberrant activation of Stat3 has been extensively documented in human cancers and a
preponderance of clinical and pre-clinical data have supported a role for Stat3 in promoting
tumorigenesis (Yu and Jove, 2004). Evidence has more recently been provided for chronic
cytokine stimulation being a feature of some tumors with constitutive Stat3 phosphorylation,
providing a mechanistic rationale for pathway activation (Grivennikov and Karin, 2008). It
remains to be determined why Stat3 activation in tumor cells is not subject to the negative
feedback regulation present in normal cells. The role of Jak family kinases as the catalytic
subunits of cytokine receptors positions them as attractive therapeutic targets for pathway
inhibition. Recent development of Jak2 inhibitors for myeloproliferative neoplasms provides
the means of testing Jak kinase as a therapeutic target in solid tumors. Our data demonstrate
that Stat3 activation is primarily mediated by Jak kinase activity in a wide range of solid tumor
cell lines, and that Jak inhibition can suppress the growth of tumors with constitutive Stat3
activation. These data validate Jak kinase as a molecular target in tumor indications beyond
myeloproliferative neoplasms, and support the development of Jak inhibitors for treatment of
human solid tumors harboring persistent Stat3 activity.

Enzyme assays and kinase profiling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Inhibition studies of AZD1480 were performed using recombinant Jak1 (aa. 850–1154, Carna
Biosciences Inc., catalog # 08–144), Jak2 (aa. 808–1132, Millipore, catalog # 14–640), or Jak3
(aa. 781–1124, AstraZeneca R&D Boston) under buffer conditions of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.3,
1 mM DTT, 0.01% Tween-20, 50 µg/ml BSA, and 10 mM MgCl2. Jak3 enzyme was expressed
as N-terminal GST fusion in insect cells and purified by glutathione-affinity and size-exclusion
chromatographies. Enzymes were assayed in the presence of AZD1480 (10 point dose
response, in triplicate, from 8.3 µM to 0.0003 µM in half-log dilution steps) using 1.5 µM
peptide substrate (Jak1: FITC-C6-KKHTDDGYMPMSPGVA-NH2, Intonation Technologies
Inc., MA, Jak2 and Jak3: FAM-SRCtide, Molecular Devices, catalog # RP7095) and screened
under their respective ATP Km (Jak1: 55 µM, Jak2: 15 µM, Jak3: 3 µM) and approximated
physiological ATP concentration of 5 mM. Phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptides
were separated and quantified by a Caliper LC3000 system (Caliper Life Sciences, MA) for
calculating percent inhibition. Jak2 kinetic studies were performed as previously described
(Gozgit et al., 2008).

Viral vector production

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

293T cells were plated at a density of 4 × 106 cells per 10-cm culture dish. Cells were cotransfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation with either 15 µg of pLKO1-Stat3 shRNA1
(#840) or pLKO1-Stat3 shRNA2 (#842) or pLK01-puro or pLK01-non-silencing shRNA
(Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and 10 µg of pPACK packaging plasmid mix (SBI, Mountain View,
CA). The culture medium was replaced with fresh medium after 6 h. Supernatant was collected
24 h and 48 h after transfection. To determine the viral titers, 105 HT1080 cells were seeded
in a six-well plate and transduced with various dilutions of the vector in the presence of 4 µg
of Polybrene/ml (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The culture medium was replaced 48 h later with
fresh medium containing puromycin (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) at a concentration of 1.5 µg/ml.
Puromycin-resistant colonies were counted 10 d after transduction. MDA-MD-468 cells were
transduced with viral vector at a multiplicity of infection of 0.5.
Luminex immunoassay
IL-6 was measured using the human specific Milliplex map kit (Millipore Corporation,
Billerica, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the Luminex 100™ System
(Bioplex System, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Samples were assayed in duplicate for cell culture
medium and cell lysate, and in triplicate for tumor lysate. Total protein (mg/ml) was determined
using BCA™ protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry
MDAH2774 xenograft tissues were harvested 2 and 6 h after a single 30 mg/kg dose of
AZD1480, fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin (24 h), paraffin-embedded, and sectioned
(5 µm). Immunohistochemistry was performed on the Ventana Discovery XT Autostainer
using the standard CC1 protocol. Primary antibodies were pStat3 antibody (Cell Signaling
Technology #9145) total Stat3 (CST # 4904) and pHisH3 (CST # 9701) using either OmniMap
DAB detection kit (# 760–149), or DABMap detection kit (# 760–124). Secondary antibody
was a biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (Vector Laboratories, cat # PK6101) used per manufacturer’s
instructions. A negative control reagent, non-immune rabbit Ig (Ventana # 760–1029), was run
in place of primary Ab to evaluate non-specific staining. The slides were counterstained with
hematoxylin (Ventana # 760–2021).
Confocal microscopy

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For confocal microscopy, cells were fixed with formaldehyde as described (Herrmann et al.,
2004), then mounted with Vectashield HardSet mounting medium with DAPI (Vector
laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Confocal imaging was carried out on a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta
confocal microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany, 63 × 1.2 NA Zeiss water immersion objective,
1µM confocal slice). YFP emissions were detected as previously described (Pranada et al.,
2004). DAPI was visualized using a two photon laser exciting at 435nm–485nm.
Quantification of Stat3 nuclear translocation
YFP fluorescence intensity acquired by linear profiles using LSM image browser were
corrected and normalized and used to calculate a translocation index (Ti) of Stat3 using the
equation:

Intravital multiphoton laser microscopy

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Mice were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions and were used in compliance
with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of City of Hope,
which conform to institutional and national regulatory standards on experimental animal usage.
Mice were anesthetized with isofluorane gas, and kept warm with either a heat lamp or a heating
blanket, and prepared for surgery. Mice were then retro-orbitally injected with 25 µg of Hoechst
33342 (Sigma) and 10 µG of Annexin V-FITC (BioVision) in Hank’s balanced salt solution
(HBSS). An incision was made near the midline creating a skin flap that exposed the tumor
that was then folded over and pinned to the cork surface of the microscope stage insert. The
imaging site was cleaned with normal saline and ddH2O and then coverslipped. The coverslip
was held in place against the tumor tissue with thumbscrews. The mouse continued to receive
isofluorane anesthesia while imaging was performed utilizing Prairie Technologies Ultima
microscope (Middleton, WI) using illumination from a Coherent Chameleon Ultra II
Ti:Sapphire laser (Santa Clara, CA). An Olympus 10×/0.3 objective lens was used and the
excitation and emission spectra used for the fluorophores were: Hoechst 33342 excitation at
730 nm with emission between 435 nm – 485 nm, Annexin V-FITC and YFP excitation at 860
nm with emission between 500 nm – 550 nm. Extracellular matrix (ECM) is given by second
harmonic generation (2HG) through λ[excit.] = 890 nm. TIFF formatted images were collected
using Prairie View software at a resolution of 1024 × 1024 pixels and then transferred to Image
Pro software version 6.3 for brightness, contrast, and color adjustment.
Western blot
Cells were lysed with SDS buffer or RIPA buffer. Xenograft lysates were prepared by FastPrep
homogenization (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) in Swedish lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH7.5,
150 mM NaCl, 1% NP40), or RIPA buffer, supplemented with 1× protease (Roche,
Indianapolis, IN) and phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich) inhibitors. 50–100 µg of protein were
resolved in 4–12% SDS-PAGE or NuPage Novex gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and
transferred to NuPage nitrocellulose membranes (Invitrogen). After blocking (1 h, RT) with
5% milk in PBS-0.1% Tween 20, membranes were incubated overnight with indicated
antibodies and then exposed to secondary antibody. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized
with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Pierce Biotechnology). Signals were
also detected with the LiCor Odyssey Infrared system using Licor blocking buffer and
fluorescent LiCor secondary antibodies. The westerns and quantitation described with the Ba/
F3 engineered cells were performed as previously described (Gozgit et al., 2008).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cell viability assays
The Ba/F3 engineered cells were assayed as previously described (Gozgit et al., 2008). Cell
growth in vitro was measured using the CellTiter 96 AQ Nonradioactive cell proliferation assay
(Promega, Madison, WI). Briefly LN-17 cells (5 × 103) were plated in 96-well plates in
quintuplicate in RPMI plus 10% charcoal-stripped FBS and allowed to attach for 24 h prior to
the addition of DMSO or AZD1480 to the culture medium. After 72 h, 20 µL/well of 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium/
phenazine ethosulfate solution was added. After incubation (1 h, 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere),
absorbance at 490 nm was recorded by using an ELISA plate reader.
Flow cytometric analysis of annexin V
LN-17 cells (2 × 105) were seeded into six well dishes and allowed to attach overnight.
Following attachment, the medium was replaced with RPMI containing 10% charcoal-stripped

FBS with DMSO, or AZD1480 as indicated. Following 72 h incubation, cells were washed
twice with cold PBS, harvested with PBS supplemented with EDTA and were stained using
the Annexin-V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Data acquisition and analysis was performed by the Flow Cytometry Core Facility
at the City of Hope (Duarte, Ca).
EMSA
For the detection of DNA-binding activity of Stat3 by EMSA, nuclear protein extracts were
prepared using high-salt extraction as previously described (Garcia et al., 2001). To detect
Stat3 DNA binding activity, 5 µg of nuclear protein from AZD1480 treated LN-17 cells were
incubated with 32P-radiolabeled double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides using a high-affinity
variant of the sis-inducible element derived from the c-fos gene promoter, which binds
activated Stat3 and STAT1 proteins (Wagner et al., 1990; Yu et al., 1995). Anti-Stat3
polyclonal antibodies (C20X, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as blocking antibodies to
identify Stat3 binding. For blocking assays, 1 mL of the concentrated Stat3 antibody was preincubated with nuclear protein for 20 min at room temperature prior to the addition of
radiolabeled probe (30 min, 30 °C) and separated by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gelelectrophoresis and autoradiographic detection.
Cell transfection and RNA interference

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

MDAH2774 (2.5 × 106) and LN-17 (2.0 × 106) cells were transfected with siRNAs using the
Amaxa Nucleofector (Amaxa, Gaithersburg, MD) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
MDAH2774 Cells were transfected with 100nM siRNA using Amaxa Solution-L and program
A-033. LN-17 cells were transfected with 300nM (LN-17) siRNA using Amaxa Solution-R
and program T-009. A GFP-expressing plasmid (Amaxa) was used to determine transfection
efficiency. Silencer GAPDH siRNA, Non-silencing siRNA, Silencer Validated Jak1 (42841,
219), Jak2 siRNAs (607, 608), and Tyk2 siRNA (399, 398) were purchased from Ambion
(Austin, TX). Cells were plated in a poly-L-Lycine coated 6 well plate (BD) and incubated at
37 °C/0.5% CO2 for 24 h and 48 h. Cell lysates were collected for Western immunoblotting.
Tumor models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor studies were performed as previously described (Hedvat et al., 2004). Four to six week
old athymic mice were purchased from Taconic Laboratories and acclimated for at least 3 d
prior to tumor implantation. Mice bearing MDAH2774 xenografts were maintained under
specific pathogen-free conditions and were used in compliance with protocols approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of AstraZeneca, which conform to institutional
and national regulatory standards on experimental animal usage. All remaining animal model
studies were used in compliance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committees of City of Hope. Cell lines were subcutaneously implanted in athymic mice
for MEF-Stat3-YFP, DU145, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB-468 cells expressing Stat3 shRNA
or vector alone and 786-0 cells expressing pRC-vector or pRC-Stat3C in a 1:1 mixture of
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and culture medium. Cell lines were subcutaneously implanted in
athymic mice with PBS for MDAH2774 cells. Tumor-bearing mice were randomized based
on tumor volume prior to the initiation of treatment, which was initiated when average tumor
volume was at least 65 mm3. AZD1480 was given orally (p.o.) as indicated in water
supplemented with 0.5 % Hypermellose and 0.1 % Tween 80. Tumors were measured every
3–4 d with vernier calipers, and tumor volumes were calculated by the formula, 0.5 * (larger
diameter) * (smaller diameter) 2.

Statistical analysis of tumor models

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) is calculated as 1 – T / C. T / C = ( DT / DC ) * 100 where
T > 0; or % T/C = ( DT / T1 ) * 100 where DT < 0. DT is the change of tumor volume in the
treatment group, DC is that for the control group, and T1 is the mean tumor volume at the start
of treatment.
P-values indicated for animal efficacy studies consisting of 2 cohorts, LN-17 cell line derived
data, or CBC data were derived using a student’s-t test. Statistical analysis of the MDAH2774
xenograft study was performed with one-way ANOVA, and p-values were corrected for
multiple comparisons to control by Dunnett’s method.
Significance
Development of small-molecule inhibitors of Jak2 for the treatment of myeloproliferative
neoplasms provides an opportunity to assess the role of persistent Jak/Stat activation in solid
tumors. Chronic cytokine stimulation is associated with constitutive Stat3 activation in
many types of tumors, contributing to growth and survival. Using the Jak2 inhibitor,
AZD1480, we demonstrate the central role of Jak family kinases in Stat3 activation and
growth of human solid tumor xenografts. Our data provide support for the further
development of Jak2 inhibitors for treatment of solid tumors.

multiphoton laser microscopy of Stat3 subcellular localization in a tumor. Two photon imaging
of intact MEF-Stat3-YFP tumors treated with AZD1480 at 50 mg/kg for 2 weeks, as described
above or vehicle alone. Tumors were visualized 2 h after treatment. Stat3 was visualized real
time through exciting the YFP fluorophore tethered to the Stat3 protein. Individual
fluorescence channels are presented in the vehicle-treated and AZD1480 treated tumors.
Merged images in the control tumor display nuclear localization of Stat3 as depicted by the
white dots in the field, created by an overlap of the nuclei and Stat3 emissions. Merged images
of the treated tumor depict areas of Stat3 fluorescence that do not overlap with nuclei
fluorescence, indicating cytoplasmic localization of Stat3. The bar represents a distance of 100
µM.
