ABSTRACT
SapC-DOPS is a novel nanotherapeutic that has been shown to target and induce
cell death in a variety of cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM). GBM is a primary
brain tumor known to frequently demonstrate resistance to apoptosis-inducing
therapeutics. Here we explore the mode of action for SapC-DOPS in GBM, a treatment
being developed by Bexion Pharmaceuticals for clinical testing in patients. SapC-DOPS
treatment was observed to induce lysosomal dysfunction of GBM cells characterized
by decreased glycosylation of LAMP1 and altered proteolytic processing of cathepsin
D independent of apoptosis and autophagic cell death. We observed that SapC-DOPS
induced lysosomal membrane permeability (LMP) as shown by LysoTracker Red and
Acridine Orange staining along with an increase of sphingosine, a known inducer
of LMP. Additionally, SapC-DOPS displayed strong synergistic interactions with the
apoptosis-inducing agent TMZ. Collectively our data suggest that SapC-DOPS induces
lysosomal cell death in GBM cells, providing a new approach for treating tumors
resistant to traditional apoptosis-inducing agents.

INTRODUCTION

with a glioblastoma (GBM) is less than 15 months.[4,
5] Part of the recalcitrant nature of these tumors is due
to their intrinsic resistance to therapy-induced apoptosis
and enhanced survival signaling.[6] There is therefore an
unmet need for novel therapeutics and treatment strategies
to combat this disease.
SapC-DOPS are stable nanovesicles formed by the
coupling of the sphingolipid activating protein saposin

Gliomas constitute nearly 70% of all malignant
primary brain tumors[1] and have been wellcharacterized for their inherent and acquired resistance
to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.[2, 3] Despite surgical
resection, chemotherapy with temozolomide (TMZ),
and radiotherapy median survival of patients diagnosed

RESULTS/DISCUSSION

C (SapC) and dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS).[7]
Recently we demonstrated the ability of systemically
administered SapC-DOPS nanovesicles to specifically
target brain tumors and the tumor-associated vasculature
resulting in significant antitumor effects.[8] Treatment of
neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer cells with SapCDOPS has been shown to generate increased ceramide
levels through activation of acid sphingomyelinase,
leading to subsequent caspase activation and apoptosis.
[7, 9] However, most GBM cells are intrinsically resistant
to apoptosis and the mechanism of cell death induced by
SapC-DOPS in GBM remains to be elucidated. In this
study we examined the activation of key downstream
molecular signaling events following SapC-DOPS
treatment in GBM and report a novel mechanism of
action for SapC-DOPS-induced cell death, which can be
combined with TMZ to improve efficacy.

SapC-DOPS-induced cell death is independent of
apoptotic and autophagic cell death
Previously we observed SapC-DOPS treatment
of neuroblastoma and pancreatic cancer cells to induce
caspase activation and apoptosis;[7, 9] however, western
blot analysis of primary GBM neurospheres or serumcultured GBM cells treated with LD50 doses of SapCDOPS revealed no obvious change in caspase activation
or DNA damage markers (Fig. 1A and Supplemental Fig.
1A). Consistent with this SapC-DOPS treatment did not
induce cell cycle arrest and was not dependent on p53
status (Supplemental Fig. 1B-D). Additionally, treatment
of GBM neurospheres with the pan-caspase inhibitor
Z-VAD-FMK did not rescue SapC-DOPS-induced
cytotoxicity, suggesting a caspase-independent mechanism
of cell death (Fig. 1B). To determine whether this lack
of apoptotic signaling was specific to GBM, we treated a

Figure 1: SapC-DOPS-induced cell death is independent of apoptotic and autophagic cell death. (A) Apoptotic and DNA damage markers

were analyzed in GBM 169 neurospheres by immunoblot 48h following treatment with TMZ or SapC-DOPS (indicated doses). (B) GBM

panel of cancer cell lines with SapC-DOPS and evaluated
apoptotic markers via western blot. Interestingly, we
observed increased levels of cleaved PARP and/or
γ-H2AX in 5/8 of these cell lines, suggesting that the
mechanism by which SapC-DOPS kills GBM cells may
depend on the genetic/molecular alterations within the
cell and future studies will determine the key signaling
pathways that govern the mechanism of cell death
execution in different cells (Supplemental Fig. 2A-C).
Morphological characterization of SapC-DOPS-induced
cell death by transmission electron micrography revealed
a lack of morphological hallmarks of apoptosis (chromatin
condensation and nuclear fragmentation), but did reveal
cytoplasmic vacuoles with features of autophagosomes
(Supplemental Fig. 3A-B). While induction of LC3II is observed in GBM cells treated with SapC-DOPS,
knockdown of autophagy dependent genes ATG5 and
BECN1, which reduced LC3-II levels (Supplemental Fig.
3C), had no effect on SapC-DOPS-induced cytotoxicity

(Fig. 1C-D). Future studies will be necessary to identify
the importance of autophagy signaling in response to
SapC-DOPS treatment in vivo.

SapC-DOPS induces lysosomal cell death
via membrane permeability and organelle
dysfunction
Saposins are localized to the lysosome where they
activate various lysosomal lipid degrading enzymes.
[10] To test whether SapC-DOPS affected lysosome
function/integrity we investigated the impact of
SapC-DOPS on lysosomes using the lysosomotropic
fluorochrome Acridine Orange (AO) and the acidophilic
dye LysoTracker Red (LTR). Treatment with SapC-DOPS
resulted in a substantial decrease in acidic vesicular
organelles as determined by decreased red fluorescence of
AO and LTR (Fig. 2A). Quantification of LTR uptake by

FACS analysis also revealed a significant reduction in LTR
fluorescence following treatment implicating an impact of
SapC-DOPS on lysosome number and/or integrity (Fig.
2B). Lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1)
is an extensively glycosylated transmembrane protein
which protects the lysosome from self-destruction whose
size varies from approximately 130 kDa (glycosylated) to
30 kDa (unglycosylated).[11] LAMP1 expression and/or
changes in its glycosylation state reflect lysosomal stability
and function. Western blot analysis revealed no change in
total LAMP1 protein levels, but did reveal a reduction
in the levels of glycosylation of LAMP1, evident by its
faster migration (100 vs. 130 kDa) concomitant with an
increase in the unglycosylated (30 kDa) form (Fig. 2C and
Supplemental Fig. 4A). Cathepsin D is the most abundant
lysosomal aspartate protease, which is synthesized at
52 kDa (procathepsin D), targeted to the lysosome by
the mannose-6-phosphate receptor and cleaved yielding
a 48 kDA fragment (preprocathepsin D) that is further
processed by lysosomal proteases into the mature 34
kDa fragment.[12] SapC-DOPS treatment revealed

a reduction in the levels of mature cathepsin D, with a
concomitant increase in the pro/preprocathepsin D levels
(Fig. 2C and Supplemental Fig. 4A). Changes in LMP and
alterations in the glycosylation of LAMP1 and proteolytic
processing of cathepsin D indicate significant lysosome
dysfunction induced by SapC-DOPS. Furthermore, we
observed a significant decrease in ATP levels following
SapC-DOPS treatment indicative of necrosis (Fig. 2D and
Supplemental Fig. 4B). Interestingly, almost all cancer
cell lines analyzed displayed similar alterations to LAMP1 (Supplemental Fig. 2A-C) irrespective of the induction
of markers of apoptosis, indicating that susceptibility of
different cell types to SapC-DOPS-induced lysosomal
damage may be a key mechanism involved in SapCDOPS-induced cytotoxicity.

SapC-DOPS alters sphingolipid intermediates
Alterations in the balance of bioactive sphingolipids/
ceramides/sphingosine-1 phosphate have been shown to
regulate pro-survival and pro-death signaling in numerous

tumor types including GBM.[13, 14] We investigated
changes in sphingolipid intermediates through an unbiased
liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry lipid analysis
(Supplemental Fig. 5A-B) Sphingosine, which has been
shown to be a potent inducer of apoptotic and necrotic
cell death through LMP[15], was observed to increase
significantly following SapC-DOPS treatment, with no
detectable increase in sphingosine-1 phosphate levels
(Fig. 3A). Next we treated the GBM neurospheres with
sphingosine (10 µM) and observed a decrease in the
mature form of cathepsin D and a slightly faster migration
of LAMP-1 resembling the responses observed after SapCDOPS treatment (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, sphingosine has
been shown to induce Golgi fragmentation, which could
be responsible for the decrease in global glycosylation and
future studies will reveal the exact mechanism for SapCDOPS-induced LAMP1 changes.[16, 17] Pre-treating

GBM neurospheres with the acid ceramidase inhibitor
D-NMAPPD, preventing the hydrolysis of ceramide
into sphingosine, resulted in a significant rescue of cell
viability following SapC-DOPS (Fig. 3C). We propose
that SapC-DOPS treatment leads to the catabolism of
sphingomyelin into ceramide, which is converted to
sphingosine, resulting in LMP and lysosome dysfunctioninduced necrotic cell death. It is possible that the levels
of ceramide synthase, ceramidase, and sphingosine kinase
in different cell types may dictate how they respond to
SapC-DOPS treatment, resulting in increased ceramide
and corresponding apoptosis in some cells and increased
sphingosine, LMP, and necrotic cell death in others.

was determined by MTT assay (Roche), and ATP assay
kit (Abcam) respectively according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. SapC-DOPS was formulated as described.
[7-9]

Based on the caspase-independent signaling in
GBM following SapC-DOPS treatment, we investigated
possible synergistic interactions in combination with
the apoptosis-inducing agent TMZ. Moderate to strong
synergy was observed using the median-effect method
of the Chou-Talalay analysis in a panel of traditional
serum-cultured GBM cells (X12v2 and Gli36ΔEGFR)
and GBM neurospheres (GBM 97 and GBM 169) (Fig.
4A). Immunoblots of GBM neurospheres revealed a dosedependent reduction in the size of LAMP1 in neurospheres
treated with SapC-DOPS alone and increased y-H2AX in
neurospheres treated with TMZ alone and the induction
of both pathways in neurospheres treated with TMZ
and SapC-DOPS (Fig. 4B). In order to evaluate the
effect of TMZ and SapC-DOPS combination in vivo,
we established intracranial GBM 169 xenografts in
athymic nude mice and treated them with systemically
administered BXQ-350, the clinical formulation of SapCDOPS, TMZ, or the combination. Tumor presence and size
was evaluated by T2-weighted MRI in a random selection
of 5 mice/group and visible tumors were observed in 5/5
control mice, 3/5 TMZ treated mice, 4/5 BXQ-350 treated
mice, and 0/5 combination treated mice (Fig. 4C). None
of the mice treated with the combination of TMZ and
BXQ-350 displayed any visible signs of tumor 48d post
tumor implant and there was a significant enhancement in
median survival of mice compared to either agent alone
(Fig. 4D). The majority of the mice do eventually succumb
to disease, which could be a result of a small set of tumor
cells that are inherently resistant to this treatment or
residual tumor cells may have acquired resistance through
additional mutations and/or activation of compensatory
survival pathways.

Lipid Quantifications
Sphingolipids were measured using liquid
chromatography-mass spectrometry method at the
lipodomics core of the Medical University of South
Carolina as described[19].

In Vivo Xenografts
Anesthetized mice fixed in a stereotactic apparatus
were implanted at 2 mm lateral to bregma, at a depth of 3
mm with GBM 169 cells (1x105). Mice were treated with
TMZ/DMSO by gavage and BXQ-350/DOPS by tail vein
injection, at doses/days indicated.

Statistical Analysis
Student’s t-test was used to analyze in vitro
experiments. P<0.05 was considered statistically
significant in Student’s t-test and all error bars represent
standard deviation. See supplemental materials and
methods.
