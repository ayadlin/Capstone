ABSTRACT
In this study, we designed and fabricated self-assembly nanospheres, which
consisted of a P45 peptide and doxorubicin (Dox). P45 is a hybrid peptide composed
of an Arg-Gly-Asp motif linked to the human matrilin-1 C-terminal domain by a serine
linker. The fabricated nanospheres had a uniform mulberry-like spherical shape, a
diameter of 63 nm, excellent polydispersity, and high Dox drug-loading efficiency.
In the presence of the RGD motif, the Dox/P45 nanospheres could specifically
target A549 cells, which have high integrin αvβ3 expression. Confocal laser scanning
microscopy and flow cytometry results showed the enhanced cellular uptake of Dox/
P45, and the CCK8 assay indicated the low cytotoxicity of the nanospheres to normal
human embryonic kidney 293 cells. Furthermore, the fabricated nanospheres were
stable in a physiological environment, but they disassembled and exhibited a rapid
Dox release in an acidic atmosphere, allowing for a specific pH-sensitive release into
cytosol after cellular uptake. These results suggest that natural amphiphilic peptides
can be used as carriers of nanodrugs for targeting delivery as well as controlled drug
release for cancer therapy.

Previously reported as “cartilage matrix protein”
(CMP) [5, 6], matrilin-1 is the prototype member of the
human matrilin family; it is an adaptor in the assembly of
the extracellular matrix structure. The last 28 amino acids
at the C-terminus of matrilin-1 (Q466-T494) are known to
form a coiled coil of four α-helices and have the capability
to self-assemble into a stable (Tm>60 °C) homodimer or
trimer [7–11]. The coiled-coli motif has multiple functions
[12–16]. Most recent studies have shown that it is a potent
carrier for cancer treatment owing to its structural stability
and specificity [16–18].
In this study, a 41-residue peptide (P41) based on
the C-terminal domain of human matrilin-1 is designed
to generate a self-assembly nanosphere. The Arg-GlyAsp (RGD) peptide is considered an excellent ligand for
integrin αvβ3, which is overexpressed in various tumor
cells, and thus shows good targeting potential [19–22].
Therefore, we synthesize a so-called P45 biofunctional
hybrid (hereafter referred to as P45), which consists of the
RGD peptide linked to the N-terminal domain of P41 with
a serine linker (Figure 1). In the presence of a cationic

INTRODUCTION
As a nanoscale drug delivery system for tumor
therapy, nanosphere-based drug delivery has been
extensively investigated over the past decades. As
alternatives to classical nanosphere-based delivery
systems, such as liposome and polymer vehicles, peptidebased nanoparticles represent a novel class of drug carriers
[1]. Native amphiphilic peptides, particularly humanderived peptides, are considered powerful and promising
tools in clinical anti-tumor research owing to their high
biocompatibility, non-toxicity, non-immunogenicity, and
diversiform structures. The self-assembling capabilities of
peptide amphiphiles are attributed to their protein nature
resulting from intra- or intermolecular hydrogen bonds
and amphiphilic and electrostatic interactions, leading to
well-defined nanostructures, such as nanofibers, nanotubes,
and ribbons [2–4]. However, uniform spherical micelles
formed by self-assembly native peptides have been rarely
reported.

drug, such as doxorubicin (Dox), P45 self-assembles into a
spherical nanoparticle (Dox/P45) (Figure 2). Particle size,
polydispersity index (PDI), and microscopic morphology
are obtained by DLS and TEM. The cellular uptake of
Dox/P45 is also investigated by flow cytometry (FCM)
and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In
addition, the cytotoxicity of the Dox/P45 nanoparticles is
confirmed by CCK-8 assay.

P45 peptide was synthesized, refolded, and purified
as previously reported [9]. As shown in Supplementary

obtained, and the molecular weight by mass spectrometry
matched the theoretical value.
The critical micelle concentration (CMC) was
determined by fluorescence spectroscopy using pyrene as
the hydrophobic fluorescent probe. Pyrene is sensitive to
environmental hydrophobicity. The CMC of P45 peptide
in PBS was estimated by measuring the fluorescence
intensity at wavelengths of 373 and 384 nm, which
correspond to the first vibronic band (I1) and the third
vibronic band (I3) of pyrene, respectively. The ratios of
I1 to I2 are plotted in Figure 3, which shows that a sudden
slip appeared at a concentration of 1.25 mM, which was
assumed the CMC of the peptide.

and homogeneous Dox/P45 nanoparticle demonstrated a
PDI of 0.189 and a corresponding diameter of 167 ± 3.3
nm when the molar ratio of Dox to peptide was set to 8
(Figure 5A and 5B). TEM was employed to observe the
structure of the Dox/P45 nanoparticles, which exhibited
a uniform spherical shape resembling a mulberry with a
diameter of 63 nm (Figure 5C).
Entrapment efficiency (EE) and drug loading (DL)
at various Dox/P45 molar ratios are shown in Figure
6, revealing that the EE and DL values increased with
the peptide proportion and reached a plateau at a molar
ratio below 8:1 (Dox:peptide). The maximal EE and DL
reached 38.6 and 49.2%, respectively.

CD analysis of the peptide structure

pH-Dependent drug release

CD spectroscopy was employed to characterize
the secondary structure of P45 in the aqueous buffer.
The result demonstrated that the peptide demonstrated
maximum absorption levels at 208 and 221 nm; these
peaks are usually considered typical of an α-helix
(Figure 4).

The drug release rates of Dox/P45 nanoparticles into
aqueous solutions at different pH and a temperature of 37
°C were verified and compared. As shown in Figure 7, the
Dox release was characterized by binary kinetics in acidic
buffers: a rapid release in the first hour followed by a slow
release lasting for several hours. The total release reached
60.8% and 39.9% after 6 h in pH 5.5 and pH 6.5 buffers,
respectively. By contrast, the release at physiological pH
7.4 was negligible.

Characterization of self-assembled Dox/P45
nanoparticles
P45 formed into nanoparticles via self-assembly in
the presence of Dox; however, the average hydrodynamic
diameter of the Dox/P45 nanoparticles and the
corresponding PDI varied when the molar ratio of Dox to
peptide shifted, as shown in Table 1. An obtained neutral

FCM analysis
The roles of the targeting RGD peptide during
the cell internalization of Dox/P45 nanoparticles were
investigated by FCM. As shown in Figure 8, the Dox/P45

mean intensity values in both A549 and MCF-7 cells than
the Dox/P41 nanoparticles group. The free Dox group
showed the strongest geometric mean intensity value
among the three cell lines. However, both the absence and
presence of the RGD peptide of the nanoparticles did not
influence the cellular uptake by human embryonic kidney
293 (HEK293) cells.

in HEK293 cells (Figure 11). Free Dox mainly presented
in the nuclei of A549, MCF-7, and HEK293 cells,
whereas the Dox/P41 nanoparticles exhibited no intense
intracellular fluorescence in these cells as expected.

In vitro cytotoxicity studies
The drug efficacy of Dox/P45 nanoparticles was
investigated by CCK8 assay using A549, MCF-7, and
HEK293 cells separately (Figure 12). The IC50 value
of the Dox/P45 nanoparticles was 0.57 μg/mL for A549
cells; this value was comparable to that of free Dox (0.39
μg/mL). For MCF-7 cells, the IC50 value of the Dox/P45
nanoparticles was 2.2 μg/mL, whereas that of free Dox was
0.42 μg/mL. The IC50 value of the Dox/P45 nanoparticles
for MCF-7 cells was approximately twice as high as that
for A549 cells. By contrast, the Dox/P45 nanoparticles had
no apparent cytotoxicity for HEK293 cells, whereas free
Dox caused a strong inhibition, exhibiting an IC50 value
of 0.24 μg/mL. The Dox/P41 nanoparticles also exhibited

Confocal laser scanning microscopy
The targeting effect and cell penetrating efficiency
of the Dox/P45 nanoparticles were further evaluated
by CLSM. The cell nuclei were stained with Hoechst
33342 blue in contrast to the red fluorescent Dox in the
nanocarrier to clarify the internalization of the nanocarrier.
As shown in Figure 9, the strong red fluorescence
presented in the A549 cellular cytoplasm reveal the
specific targeting of Dox/P45 to A549 cells, whereas a
significantly weaker fluorescence was found in MCF-7
cells (Figure 10) and almost no red fluorescence showed

Generally, they consist of two typical regions, the
hydrophobic tail and the hydrophilic head. In aqueous
solutions, the aggregation of hydrophobic tails drives
self-assembly, leaving the hydrophilic head containing
functional motifs present on the surface of the
nanostructure [2, 3].

family, of which the members share a basic skeleton

DISCUSSION
Amphiphilic peptides tend to self-assemble into
high-aspect-ratio nanostructures, such as nanofibers,
nanotubes, and ribbons, under certain conditions.

the DLS method was the hydrodynamic diameter; the
nanoparticles exhibited a larger hydrodynamic volume due
to the effect of the solvent in the hydrated state. If used
as drug nanocarriers, the Dox/P45 nanoparticles could
benefit from their small size, which could facilitate tumor
penetration, permit their accumulation in tumor tissues
by the enhanced permeability retention effect, and bypass
the elimination by the kidney [25, 26]. The mulberry-like
nanoparticles in the TEM image suggested that at least two
different substructures of different electron density were
present. P45 consisted of elements similar to Dox, except
for elemental sulfur. Elemental sulfur analysis by TEM
was performed, and the result did not indicate a specific
distribution of sulfur (data not shown). How the molecules
assembled remains unknown, however.
For the evaluation of the kinetics of drug release,
P45/Dox nanoparticles were incubated in buffers of
different pH levels. No apparent release was observed
after 6 h in physiological pH buffer. By contrast, the acidic
buffer of pH 6.5 or 5.5 significantly increased Dox release
(Figure 7). This result may be attributed to the protonation
of acidic amino acids in the P45/Dox nanoparticles. At
physiological pH, the rich, negatively charged domain
remained deprotonated/deionized in the presence of
Dox. By contrast, acidic pH allows for carboxyl group
protonation, causing the structural transformation or
disassembly between P45 peptide and Dox because
of charge repulsion and consequently leading to the
specific release of encapsulated Dox [27, 28]. These data
suggested that the nanoparticles are stable at the blood pH,
but the drug is released at an appreciable rate at the tumor
interstitial pH (6.5) and late endosomal pH (5.5) [11, 12].
A549, MCF-7, and HEK293 cell lines, which
respectively represent cell models with high, low, and
negative expression of integrin αvβ3, were used in this
study [29–33] to evaluate the targeting effect during
the cellular uptake of P45/Dox nanoparticles. After
being exposed to Dox/P45 nanoparticles, A549 showed
a significantly higher intracellular uptake than MCF-7
or HEK293 cells, according to the CLSM (Figures 911) and FCM results (Figure 8). Non-targeting Dox/P41
nanoparticles with shapes and sizes similar to DOX/
P45 had weaker cellular internalization as a result of
the absence of the RGD peptide. These results indicated
the merits of the RGD peptide for targeting delivery
in cancer cells expressing αvβ3. The normal cell line
showed no intracellular uptake after being co-incubated
with both Dox/P45 and Dox/P41 nanoparticles, implying
that the nanoparticles were considerably large to
penetrate the cytomembrane freely and the intracellular
uptake of the nanoparticles relied on a receptor-mediated
endocytosis. As a small hydrophobic molecule, free
Dox exhibited higher cellular uptake, and it was mainly
present in the nuclei of the three cell lines (Figures 911), indicating its unspecific delivery and nucleophilic
nature [34, 35].

composed of three segregated domains, namely, the von
Willebrand factor A (vWFA) domain, the epidermal
growth factor (EGF)-like domain, and the C-terminal
α-helical coiled-coil module [7, 23]. The C-terminal
coiled-coil domain has a distinctive heptad repeat, in
which hydrophobic residues reside in the first and the
forth positions whereas polar residues are usually present
in the fifth and seventh sites [8]. The hydrophobic and
ionic interactions within this α-helical coiled-coil are
responsible for the formation of a parallel, disulfide-linked
dimer or trimer with a length of approximately 5.1 nm and
a diameter of 3 nm [8].
The protein sequence of the C-terminal module of
matrilin-1 was analyzed, and a rich, negatively charged
region (5 Glu, 6 Glu, 7 Asp, and 12 Glu in P45) was
found at the N-terminus of the matrilin-1 coiled-coil
domain (Figure 1). These acidic amino-acid residues
provide intermolecular electrostatic repulsion; as a result,
the peptide can be well dissolved in an aqueous buffer.
Once the negative charges are neutralized or sterically
blockaded by cationic drugs with hydrophobic aromatic
rings, such as Dox, the force balance between intra- or/
and intermolecular bonds will be broken. The coiled coils
cross-link with one another, form the hydrophobic core
via hydrophobic and aromatic interactions, and finally
self-assemble into spherical nanoparticles (Figure 2). In
the case of decreasing negative charges by adjusting pH
to 6.0 or 4.0 or masking ionic interaction by dissolution in
organic solvent, no nanospheres or defects were observed
(data not shown). Moreover, the deletion of mutant P45
without the charge tail of eight amino-acid residues
(EEDPCACE) could not form spherical particles even
in the presence of Dox (data not shown). These results
clearly implied that the negatively charge region was
crucial in nanosphere self-assembly. Furthermore, the
first two heptad repeats were more flexible than the other
repeats, rendering flexibility to the functional motif, such
as the RGD motif [10, 24] (Figure 1) at the N-terminus.
Meanwhile, the P41 without the RGD motif demonstrated
a TEM structure similar to that of the P45 peptide
(Supplementary Figure S3), suggesting that the RGD
peptide was unnecessary for the nanoparticle assembly
and was probably present at the surface for targeting.
P45 consisted of an RGD motif followed by a
41-residue peptide derived from the C-terminus of
matrilin-1. The CD spectra demonstrated two absorption
peaks at 208 and 221 nm; these peaks are characteristic
of an a-helix (Figure 4). By pyrene fluorescence assay,
the CMC of the peptide was determined to be 1.25 mM
(Figure 3).
TEM was also employed to investigate the
nanoparticle shape, and the yielded nanoparticles showed a
uniform spherical shape with a diameter of 63 nm (Figure
5), which was significantly smaller than the diameter
indicated by DLS (Table 1). TEM images depicted the
actual size in vacuum, whereas the size measured by

were taken up in oxidation buffer (1 mg/1 ml) (100 mM
ammonium acetate, pH 8.5) to refold for 3 days at RT
under stirring and purified by RP-HPLC. The prepared
peptides were lyophilized and stored in -20°C.

The cytotoxicity results was consistent the
CLSM and FCM results to a certain extent (Figures 811), indicating that the RGD peptide significantly and
effectively enhanced the cellular uptake in αvβ3-expressing
cell lines. As expected, the Dox/P45 nanoparticles
exhibited higher cytotoxicity than Dox/P41 in A549 and
MCF-7 cells, depending on the αvβ3 expression level. By
contrast, the cytotoxicity levels of Dox/P45 and Dox/
P41 are comparable in HEK293 cells, which were free
of αvβ3 expression. These results suggested the Dox/P45
nanoparticles could be smart and powerful carriers for
cancer-targeting delivery.

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy
CD measurements were performed with a Jasco-810
spectropo-larimeter (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) using a 1-mm
path-length quartz cell at 25°C. Each spectrum was obtained
by averaging our scans in the 250–190 nm wave length
range, with a 0.2 nm step resolution at 100 nm/min speeds.
The peptide was dissolved in in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4) at
100 nM (0.5 mg/ml). For a flexible peptide, the estimated
percentages of secondary structure components should not
be taken as absolute measures, but rather reflect on relative
changes between spectra in a series of experiments.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
All Chemical Reagents utilized in this study were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Company (St. Louis,
MO, USA) unless otherwise mentioned. Doxorubicin
hydrochloride (DOX·HCL) was purchased from the
Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceutical. Trypsin was obtained
from Solarbio. Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium
(DMEM), Roswell Park Memorial Institute 1640 (RPMI1640) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from
GIBCO, Invitrogen Corp. (Carlsbad, USA). Kit-8 (CCK8) was purchased from DOJINDO Co. Ltd (DOJINDO,
Japan).

CMC measurement
The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of P45
was determined by the fluorescence method by using
pyrene as the hydrophobic probe (reference). Briefly,
a 1 μL aliquot of 2 mM pyrene was added to each vial
containing acetone. After evaporating acetone overnight,
a series of freshly prepared P45 concentrations in PBS
ranging from 1×10-3 mM to 2×102 mM were added to
the vials and shaken vigorously for 24 h in darkness
before sent for measurement. The pyrene fluorescence
measurements were performed with a LS-55 Fluorescence
Spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer, USA) at RT. The pyrene
excitation wavelength was 335 nm and emission spectra
were recorded from 360 to 440 nm at a scan speed of 300
nm/min using a 5 nm bandwidth. Five characteristic peaks
of pyrene fluorescence spectra were observed for each
sample. The ratio of the OD373 (I1) to OD384 (I3) was plotted
as a function of P45 concentrations. A sudden fail of the
OD373/OD384 value indicated the CMC where the pyrene
shifted from water into the hydrophobic micellar core.

Cell lines
A549 cells and MCF-7 cells were purchased from
Institute of Basic Medical Sciences, Chinese Academy of
Medical Sciences (Beijing, China). A549 and MCF-7 cell
lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 and DMEM medium,
respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL streptomycin.
Human Embryonic Kidney 293 cells were provide by Cell
Bank, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China)
and grown in DMEM medium supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 IU/mL
streptomycin. All cell lines were cultured in a humidified
incubator (5% CO2/95% air atmosphere at 37°C).

Preparation and properties of Dox/P45
nanoparticles
P45 peptide dissolved in 0.1 M PBS (pH7.4) at
0.5 mg/mL was mixed with various amounts of DOX
and the P45/DOX molar ratio ranged from 1 to 16. The
mixed solution was sonicated under stirring for 10 min.
To separate the uncombined doxorubicin from Dox/P45
nanoparticles, the dispersion was centrifuged at 20,000
rpm for 30 min. The supernatant containing free DOX
and peptide was taken away for measurement by UV-Vis
spectroscopy at 485 nm. Besides, Dox/P41 nanoparticles
were also prepared in the same way.
Entrapment efficiency (EE) of doxorubicin was
calculated using the following equations:

Dox/P45 nanoparticles, which were precipitated
as pellets, were washed twice, and then resuspended
in 200 μL PBS for further experiments. Particle size,
polydispersity index (PDI) and zeta potential of Dox/P45
nanoparticles were measured by dynamic light scattering
(DLS) analysis using a Zetasizer Nano ZS system
(Malvern Instruments Ltd, Worcestershire, UK) at 25°C.
Each measuremnt was performed in triplicate.
The morphological study of the prepared Dox/P45
nanoparticles was carried out with TEM (JEM-1010,
JEOL, Japan). In brief, the nanoparticle was dissolved in
PBS and dipped on a carbon coated copper grid. The grid
was air-dried at RT and then imaged with a TEM equipped
at 80 kV acceleration voltage.

cells or HEK cells were seeded in a petri-dish and grown
for 24 h at 37°C followed by an incubation with Dox/P45
nanoparticles, Dox/P41 nanoparticles or free Dox for 2
h at 37°C. Subsequently, the medium was discarded and
the cells were washed with PBS buffer for 3 times. The
DL (%)=(WDox/WDox/P45)×100
cellular nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 for 10
min at room temperature. The fluorescent images of cells
were observed using a laser scanning confocal microscope
(CLSM, Leica TCP SP5). DOX was excited at 485 nm
with the emission at 595 nm.

CCK-8 assay
Cytotoxicity of Dox/P45 nanoparticles was
evaluated by CCK-8 assay in HEK293 cells, A549 cells
and MCF-7 cells. Briefly, the cells were seeded in a 96well plate at a density of 1 ×104 cells per well in RPMI
1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1%
antibiotic-antimycotic and then incubated for 24h at 37°C
with 5% CO2. Free Dox, Dox/P41 or Dox/P45
nanoparticles were dissolved in fresh medium and then
added to each well. The plate was incubated for 2 h and
then washed twice with PBS. After 48 h of incubation, a
10-uL of CCK-8 was added to each well and the cells were
further incubated for 4 h and the absorbance of each well
was measured using a Microplate Reader (Model 680,
BIO-RAD, USA) at the wavelength of 450 nm. Cell
viability was calculated according to the following
equation:

Drug release studies
The in vitro release kinetics of Dox from the Dox/
P45 nanoparticle was evaluated using a dialysis method.
Briefly, 2 mL aqueous Dox/P45 nanoparticles were
contained in a dialysis bag (MWCO, 5500 Da). The
dialysis bag was placed in a beaker containing 30 mL PBS
buffer of desired pH with continuous stirring at 37°C.
A volume of 2ml PBS was periodically withdrawn and
the same volume of fresh PBS was complemented. The
released DOX was measured by UV-vis spectrophotometry
at 485 nm. The cumulative release of Dox within 6 h was
plotted over time.

Where, A was the absorbance of the cells incubated
with free Dox, Dox/P41 or Dox/P45 nanoparticles. B was
the absorbance of the cells without DOX or nanoparticles
addtion, and C was the absorbance of the blank medium.

Cellular uptake and flow cytometric analysis
A549 cells, MCF-7 breast cancer cells and Human
Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK) normal cells were used
to assess cellular uptake of Dox/P45 nanoparticle
by fluorescence activated cell analysis (FACS) (BD
Bioscience Mountain View, CA, USA). Briefly, Dox/P45,
Dox/P41 nanoparticles or free Dox added to the cells at
an equal DOX concentration of 20 μg/mL and incubated
for 2 h at 37°C. The cells were rinsed twice with PBS
and then trypsinized and resuspended in 500 μL of PBS.
About 1×104 cells were used for each FACS assay and
the cellular uptake was assessed by the red fluorescence
intensity. PBS-treated cells were used as a control.

Statistical analysis
All data in tables and figures are expressed as the

were two-sided, and P < 0.05 were considered statistical
significant.
