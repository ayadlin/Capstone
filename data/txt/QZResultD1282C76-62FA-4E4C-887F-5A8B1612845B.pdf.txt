Abstract
Small Rho GTPase (Rho) and its immediate effector Rho kinase (ROCK) are
reported to regulate cell survival, but the detailed molecular mechanism remains
largely unknown. We had previously shown that Rho/ROCK signaling was highly
activated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In this study, we further demonstrated
that downregulation of RhoE, a RhoA antagonist, and upregulation of ROCK enhanced
resistance to chemotherapy in HCC in both in vitro cell and in vivo murine xenograft
models, whereas a ROCK inhibitor was able to profoundly sensitize HCC tumors to
cisplatin treatment. Specifically, the ROCK2 isoform but not ROCK1 maintained the
chemoresistance in HCC cells. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that activation
of ROCK2 enhanced the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 through increased
expression of IL-6 and the IL-6 receptor complex. We also identified IKKβ as the direct
downstream target of Rho/ROCK, and activation of ROCK2 significantly augmented
NF-κB transcription activity and induced IL-6 expression. These data indicate that
Rho/ROCK signaling activates a positive feedback loop of IKKβ/NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3
which confers chemoresistance to HCC cells and is a potential molecular target for
HCC therapy.

Introduction

urgent need to identify new therapeutic targets to combat
against chemoresistance in HCC and provide patients with
more treatment choices.
The family of small Rho GTPases is a subfamily
of the Ras superfamily. While members of the Rho
GTPases are most well-known for their functions in
regulating cytoskeleton remodeling events, they are also
reported to be involved in controlling apoptotic signaling
and cell survival [6]. RhoA and its effector Rho kinase
(ROCK) are reported to enhance cell survival and confer
resistance to chemotherapy in different cancer types [7, 8].
However, the exact roles of Rho/ROCK in regulating HCC
chemoresistance remain undiscovered and the detailed
underlying mechanism remains largely unknown.
Both JAK/STAT3 and NF-κB pathways have been
extensively studied for their functions in promoting
cell survival through activating transcription of many
pro-survival genes [9, 10]. Rho/ROCK has been shown
to interact with JAK/STAT3. Activation of RhoA can
upregulate the phosphorylation of STAT3 at Y705
and S727 [11] and induce activation of NF-κB [12].
Therefore there is a possibility that Rho/ROCK regulates

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the seventh
most common cancer worldwide and ranks the third
leading cause of cancer-related mortality [1]. HCC is
generally resistant to systemic chemotherapy which highly
limits treatment options to patients. On the other hand,
sorafenib is the only molecularly targeted drug approved
for treating patients with advanced HCC. However,
sorafenib only extends the median overall survival of
patients by about 3 months [2]. Cancer stem cells (CSCs),
activation of pro-survival pathways and hypoxia are
important molecular mechanisms contributing to the
highly chemoresistant nature of HCC. For example, Ma et
al has demonstrated that CD133+ HCC CSCs can activate
Akt in order to enhance their resistance to chemotherapy
treatment [3]. In addition, the large hypoxic core of HCC
tumors also confers higher survival ability of HCC cells.
Hypoxia stabilizes transcription factor HIF-1α and HIF1α promotes expression of pro-survival gens such as
surviving and Bcl-2 [4] and drug-resistant genes such
as MDR1 and P-glycoprotein [5]. Therefore there is an

chemoresistance via the JAK/STAT3 and NF-κB pathways
in HCC.
We had previously demonstrated that ROCK2 was
overexpressed and RhoE, an antagonist of the Rho/ROCK
signaling, was underexpressed in HCC and together
they promote HCC metastasis [13, 14]. In this study,
we identified that these two events resulted in hyperactivation of ROCK2, which in turn activated an IKKβ/
NF-κB/IL-6/STAT3 positive feedback loop and conferred
chemoresistance to HCC cells. Our work also led to the
finding of ROCK inhibitor as a potential therapeutic agent
for both chemo-sensitization and suppression of metastasis
in HCC.

cells with Y27632 restored cisplatin-induced apoptosis
(Figure 1E).
ROCK has two isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2.
Previous studies have suggested that these two isoforms
have differential functions [16]. Therefore we aimed to
find out which isoform of ROCK was responsible for
contributing to cell survival in HCC cells. We knocked
down ROCK1 and ROCK2 in BEL-7402 with siRNA
and shRNA, respectively, and then treated the cells with
cisplatin. Knockdown of ROCK1 had no observable
effects on cisplatin-induced cell death (Figure 2A). In
contrast, knockdown of ROCK2 significantly sensitized
BEL-7402 to cisplatin (Figure 2B). This suggests
that ROCK2 is able to regulate cell survival in HCC
cells. Furthermore, since RhoE is reported to suppress
ROCK2 activity by repressing RhoA, we knocked down
RhoA by siRNA and found that RhoA knockdown also
sensitized BEL-7402 cells to cisplatin (Figure 2C). Of
note, knockdown of RhoA and ROCK2, respectively, was
able to rescue the chemoresistance enhanced by RhoE
knockdown (Figure 2D).
To ensure that the effect we observed with Y27632
was not due to non-specific activity of the inhibitor, we
overexpressed ROCK2 in SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402
cells using the transcription activator-like effectors
(TALE)-linked transcription factor approach, as described
[17] with slight modification (Supplementary Figure 2A
and 2B). As expected, cells with ROCK2 overexpression
showed enhanced chemoresistance and reduced apoptosis
to cisplatin treatment as compared with the vector control
(Supplementary Figure 2C and 2D). Taken together,
these data strongly suggest that RhoE/ROCK2 modulates
chemoresistance in HCC in vitro.

Results
RhoE/ROCK2 modulates chemoresistance in
HCC cells
To investigate the effect of Rho/ROCK signaling on
chemoresistance in HCC cells, we first knocked down its
antagonist RhoE by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) approach
in BEL-7402 and MHCC-97L HCC cells (Figure 1A). The
cells were then treated with two different chemotherapeutic
drugs, cisplatin and doxorubicin, that are used in HCC
patients, respectively. Knockdown of RhoE repressed
the chemodrug-induced cell death as compared with the
non-target control (NTC) (Figure 1B). Next, we examined
if this effect was related to ROCK activity. Addition of
ROCK inhibitor, Y27632, to BEL-7402, MHCC-97L
and SMMC-7721 cells significantly sensitized them
to cisplatin treatment (Figure 1C). Moreover, the celldeath suppression effect resulted from RhoE knockdown
(as seen from Figure 1A) was also rescued by co-treatment
with Y27632 for 48 hours (Figure 1D). An immortalized
normal liver cell line LO2 was tested for the toxicity of
combined treatment of cisplatin and Y27632. As expected,
knockdown of RhoE by siRNA enhanced resistance
to cisplatin in LO2 cells (Supplementary Figure 1A).
Although co-treatment of cisplatin and Y27632 also had
increased toxicity in LO2 cells, the degree of sensitization
is less as compared with that in BEL-7402 and MHCC-97L
cells (Supplementary Figure 1B). This suggests that
Y27632 sensitizes HCC cells to cisplatin treatment more
than normal hepatocytes. Since Rho/ROCK signaling
was reported to regulate cell survival via modulating the
expression of anti-apoptotic genes [7, 15], we investigated
if cisplatin-induced apoptosis could be altered by Rho/
ROCK in BEL-7402. Annexin-V staining flow cytometry
was performed to measure the apoptotic cell population
induced by cisplatin treatment in RhoE-knockdown cells
with or without the addition of Y27632 for 24 hours.
The results demonstrated that downregulation of RhoE
dramatically reduced the apoptotic population of cells
(Annexin-V+ve, PI−ve) treated with cisplatin alone as
compared with that of NTC. Reciprocally, co-treating the

RhoE/ROCK2 regulates chemoresistance of
HCC in vivo
To investigate if the effects of RhoE/ROCK2 on
cell survival we observed in vitro also occurred in vivo,
we first used a subcutaneous injection model in immunedeficient nude mice. RhoE knockdown BEL-7402 cells or
NTC were injected subcutaneously into nude mice and the
tumors were allowed to grow to about 100 mm3 in size.
We then administrated the mice with either cisplatin or
phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and the tumor growth rate
was recorded. Tumors derived from NTC cells responded
well to cisplatin treatment whereas tumors derived
from RhoE knockdown cells displayed similar growth
rates between the PBS and cisplatin treatment groups
(Figure 3A). The same experiment was performed using
ROCK2-overexpressing BEL7402 cells. In both ROCK2overexpressing clones, there was no significant difference
between the tumor growth rates of the cisplatin- and
PBS-treated mice. On the other hand, cisplatin treatment
drastically inhibited tumor growth in vector control
cells (Supplementary Figure 3A). We also tested the

upregulated in ROCK2-overexpressing BEL-7402 cells
when compared to the vector control (Supplementary
Figure 4).
STAT3 is a transcription factor which regulates the
transcription of pro-survival genes such as survivin, c-myc
and cyclin D [9]. To validate that the transcription activity
of STAT3 was upregulated by ROCK2, we constructed a
vector expressing firefly luciferase under the control of 6×
STAT3 binding elements. Using this construct, we showed
that both ROCK inhibitor and knockdown of ROCK2 by
siRNA decreased the STAT3-mediated transcription of
firefly luciferase (Figure 4C). Using Western blotting,
we also observed that one of the target genes of STAT3,
c-myc, was downregulated after addition of Y27632
to HCC cells (Figure 4D). Furthermore, we stained for
p-STAT3 in the tumors harvested from the subcutaneous
injection model in Figure 3B. We found strong nuclear
stain of p-STAT3 in both the PBS and cisplatin-alone
groups. In contrast, the p-STAT3 level was markedly
abrogated in both Y27632-alone and cisplatin+Y27632
groups. In particular, the p-STAT3 stain was nearly
totally abolished in cisplatin+Y27632 group (Figure 4E).
The data suggest that RhoE/ROCK2 modulates
chemoresistance in HCC via the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.
Indeed, addition of JAK2 inhibitor AG490 to BEL-7402
cells repressed phosphorylation of STAT3 and sensitized
the cells to cisplatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure 5A) and addition of AG490 was
able to rescue the enhanced chemoresistance in ROCK2
overexpressing BEL-7402 cells (Supplementary Figure 5B).

chemoresistance of the NTC and RhoE knockdown HCC
cells in an orthotopic liver injection model. MHCC-97L
cells were used in this experiment since SMMC-7721 does
not grow at all and BEL-7402 does not grow well in in
the orthotopic liver injection model. Consistent with the
results in the subcutaneous model, cisplatin profoundly
diminished the tumor volume in the NTC group, while
it exerted no observable effects in the RhoE knockdown
group (Supplementary Figure 3B). It should be noted that
both knockdown of RhoE and overexpression of ROCK2
suppressed HCC growth. This was in line with the results
from other groups [18], suggesting activation of Rho/
ROCK signaling has growth suppressive effect in HCC.
This effect may be due to the interaction between the
adhesive contexts in the local microenvironment and the
cytoskeletal tension brought by Rho/ROCK activation [19].
In the hope that ROCK inhibitor may serve as a
putative chemo-sensitizing therapy in treating HCC,
we examined the effect of Y27632 in combination with
cisplatin. Subcutaneous injection model was performed
as mentioned above using parental BEL-7402 cells. The
mice were divided into four groups and received i) PBS,
ii) Y27632, iii) cisplatin, and iv) cisplatin+Y27632,
respectively. A lower concentration of cisplatin (3 mg/kg)
was used in this experiment comparing to the dose
(4 mg/kg) used in Figure 3A in order to clearly show the
effect of Y27632 on sensitizing HCC cells to cisplatin.
Treatment of Y27632 alone showed no difference in
tumor growth rate compared to PBS. Cisplatin slightly
suppressed the tumor growth while the combined
treatment of cisplatin and Y27632 had remarkable
synergistic effect of suppressing tumor growth (Figure 3B).
In addition, we also tested the effect of the combined
treatment of cisplatin and Y27632 in an orthotopic model
using parental MHCC-97L cells. Only cisplatin+Y27632
could significantly inhibit tumor growth in the orthotopic
model, although the effect was not as drastic as in the
subcutaneous model (Supplementary Figure 3C). It should
be noted that in previous report, Y27632 was given into the
peritoneal cavity with micro-osmotic pumps, which then
ensured a more stable dose and hence persistent effect [20].
Nonetheless, collectively, these findings indicate that ROCK
inhibitor exhibits chemo-sensitizing effects in vivo in HCC.

RhoE/ROCK2 regulates the expression of IL-6
and IL-6 receptor
To explore the mechanism how JAK2/STAT3 were
activated by ROCK2, we used Y27632 and then examined
the expression of the IL-6 receptor complex and IL-6.
After treating with Y27632 for 24 hours, the mRNA
expression levels of IL-6R, gp130 and IL-6 were all
significantly reduced in SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402 cells
(Figure 5A and 5B). Reciprocally, knockdown of RhoE
enhanced the IL-6 mRNA expression when compared with
the corresponding NTCs (Figure 5C). To further confirm
that the alteration in ROCK signaling indeed affected the
secretion of functional IL-6, we used IL-6-specific ELISA
assay to detect IL-6 level in the HCC-cell-conditioned
media. We found that after incubating SMMC-7721
and BEL-7402 cells with Y27632 for 24 hours, level of
IL-6 in each of the conditioned media was dramatically
reduced as compared to the mock controls (Figure 5D).
Consistently, the IL-6 level in the conditioned medium
of the ROCK2-overexpressing cells showed significant
increases as compared with that of the vector control cells
(Supplementary Figure 6). Altogether these data strongly
indicate that RhoE/ROCK2 regulate the expression levels
of IL-6 and IL-6 receptor.

Enhanced ROCK2 activity promotes the
activation of JAK2/STAT3
In order to elucidate the underlying molecular
mechanism of how RhoE/ROCK2 might regulate HCC
chemoresistance, we screened a number of pro-survival
signaling pathways and identified JAK2/STAT3 as a
candidate. With Western blotting, we found that RhoE
knockdown by siRNA in BEL-7402 and SMMC-7721
enhanced the phosphorylation of both JAK2 and STAT3
(Figure 4A). Consistently, addition of Y27632 repressed
the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 (Figure 4B).
Furthermore, phosphorylation of STAT3 was also

p-IKKβ after Y27632 treatment in both SMMC-7721 and
BEL-7402 cells (Figure 6A and 6B). We also compared
transcriptional activation activity of NF-κB between
ROCK-inhibited cells and their corresponding controls
by firefly luciferase reporter assay. Both knockdown of
ROCK2 by siRNA and treatment with Y27632 suppressed
the firefly luciferase signal indicating repressed activity
of NF-κB (Figure 6C). To further confirm our result, we
also examined the activity of NF-κB in our ROCK2overexpressing cells using firefly luciferase reporter
assay. Both ROCK2-overexpressing clones displayed
enhanced firefly luciferase signal as compared with to
their corresponding vector controls (Supplementary
Figure 7). To demonstrate that IL-6 was also a direct

Although we demonstrated that Rho/ROCK
signaling regulated the chemoresistance in HCC through
IL-6/JAK2/STAT3, the direct phosphorylation target of
ROCK2 remained unrevealed. Recent study has reported
that IKKβ is a direct phosphorylation target of ROCK [21].
Since IL-6 is a well-documented target of NF-κB [22],
this suggests that Rho/ROCK may induce IL-6/JAK2/
STAT3 pathway through direct phosphorylation of IKKβ
and activation of NF-κB. To elucidate this possibility, we
assessed the p-IκBα and p-IKKβ levels with Western blot
analysis. We observed significant reduction of p-IκBα and

downstream target of NF-κB in HCC cells, we treated
SMMC-7721 and BEL-7402 with NF-κB inhibitor BAY
11-7082 for a short period of time (4 hours). The result
showed that inhibition of NF-κB for 4 hours already
significantly reduced the mRNA level of IL-6 and in a
dose-dependent manner (Figure 6D). On the other hand,
addition of BAY 11-7082 for 4 hours had no observable
effects on the mRNA expression level of either IL-6R or
gp130 (Supplementary Figure 8A). Treatment of Y27632
decreased pIKKα/β at around 6 hours as compared with
the untreated cells. On the other hand, the pJAK2 level
was lower in the Y27632-treated cells after 12 hours and
pSTAT3 was suppressed in Y27632-treated cells after 24
hours (Supplementary Figure 9). This indicates that the
effect of NF-κB on IL-6 signaling is mainly due to the
change in the expression of the ligand without affecting
the expression of the receptor complex. These findings
support that Rho/ROCK signaling upregulates the activity
of IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway via phosphorylation of
IKKβ and activation of NF-κB.

targeting ROCK2 have great potential to serve as a chemosensitizing therapy in HCC. In particular, the dramatic
effect of combined Y27632 and cisplatin in inhibiting
tumor growth over that of cisplatin alone in nude mice
model indicates that the activation of ROCK2 may be
crucial for maintaining the chemoresistance of HCC cells.
Importantly, there was a positive association between
the expression levels of ROCK2 and activation of IL-6
and NF-κB in HCC samples from patients. This further
supports the clinical relevance of Rho/ROCK signaling
in regulating chemoresistance, as IL-6 has been well
documented to be a pro-survival cytokine in cancers [23].
Since ROCK has two isoforms, it is important to
identify which one is specific and required for promoting
chemodrug-resistance, in order to develop more specific
inhibitors to improve targeting efficacy and reduce
potential cytotoxicity. To our knowledge, although several
studies have reported that inhibition of both ROCK1 and
ROCK2 by pan-ROCK inhibitors could induce apoptosis
in cancer cells [7, 15], the isoform-specific effect of
ROCK1 and ROCK2 has not yet been explored. This
is partially due to the reason that the two kinases share
high homology in amino acid sequence (65%) and even
higher homology in their kinase domains (95%). Despite
the high similarity between the two isoforms, there is
evidence suggesting they are not functionally redundant
[13, 24]. By knocking down each isoform individually, we
clearly demonstrated that only ROCK2 was responsible
for promoting chemoresistance in HCC. We believed that
two isoforms contribute differently in regulating apoptosis
in HCC cells. It was demonstrated that inhibition of
ROCK1 activation only abolish the fragmentation of
apoptotic cells but does not halt the apoptotic process
itself [25]. Based on our data, it is likely that in HCC
only ROCK2 can protect the cells from entering apoptosis
while ROCK1 only participates in late apoptotic events
and has no effect on the initiation of apoptosis. It will
be of interest to test whether ROCK2-specific inhibitors
such as KD025 [26] serve as a better anti-metastatic and
chemo-sensitizing therapy over the pan-ROCK inhibitors.
Our team had previously shown that MHCC-97L cells
expressed a lower level of miR-139, which is a ROCK2
expression inhibitor, than BEL-7402 and SMMC-7721
cells. Therefore it is not surprising to see that the chemosensitization effect of Y27632 was weaker in MHCC-97L
cells than in BEL-7402 and SMMC-7721 cells. Hence a
higher dose of Y27632 may be required in patients with
higher endogenous ROCK2 activity.
Active RhoA has been reported to activate STAT3 by
phosphorylation at both Y705 and S727 in HEK cells [11].
Nevertheless, the exact molecular mechanism of how Rho
GTPase activates STAT3 signaling is likely to be cell-type
dependent and remains unknown in HCC. Sanz-Moreno
et al demonstrated that in melanoma cells and the cancerassociated fibroblasts (CAFs), addition of pan-ROCK
inhibitor H-1152 could suppress STAT3 phosphorylation

ROCK2 expression correlates with NF-κB and
IL-6 activations in human HCCs
We then speculated that the relationship
between ROCK signaling and activation of IL-6 and
NF-κB was also of clinical significance. To test this
hypothesis, we examined the mRNA levels of both
ROCK2 and IL-6 in a cohort of 35 human HCC tissue
samples by qPCR. We demonstrated that the IL-6
expression positively and significantly correlated
with the ROCK2 expression in our sample cohort
(Spearman’s r = 0.4779, P = 0.004) (Figure 7A).
Furthermore, we also utilized the data of HCC patients
from the TCGA database. According to the TCGA data,
ROCK2 expression positively and significantly correlated
with those of IL6R, gp130, c-myc and VEGF in HCC
patients (Figure 7B). This suggests that higher ROCK2
expression levels correlate with activation of IL-6 and NFκB signaling in HCC patients.

Discussion
Our findings in this study have revealed that RhoE/
ROCK2 signaling is one of the important regulators
contributing to the high chemoresistance of HCC. In
the model illustrated in Figure 8, we propose that both
downregulation of RhoE and upregulation of ROCK2
lead to the augmentation of the ROCK2 activity. As a
consequence, ROCK2 promotes the phosphorylation
of IKKβ and activation of NF-κB, which then turns on
the transcription of IL-6. IL-6 acts through an autocrine
cycle, resulting in hyper-activation of STAT3. This in turn
leads to the transcriptional activation of STAT3-specific
target genes and promotion of cell survival. Our in vivo
tumor growth study strongly suggests that inhibitors

This suggests that the NF-κB pathway is likely the direct
effector of Rho/ROCK signaling. NF-κB activation leads
to accumulation of IL-6 which in turn activates JAK2
and STAT3. Enhanced expression of IL-6R and gp130
should be a subsequent event of STAT3 activation since
they are putative transcription targets of STAT3 [31, 32].
The activated STAT3 may then induce more transcription
of IL-6, which forms a positive feedback loop and confer
hyper-chemoresistance to HCC cells [33].
Currently, no ROCK inhibitors are approved for use
to treat human cancers. Nevertheless, there is growing
evidence that ROCK inhibition suppresses both cancer
progression and metastasis in murine models [20, 34].
In this study, we have further discovered that ROCK2
activation is necessary for maintaining the highly
chemoresistant nature of HCC. It is conceivable that
ROCK2 is an attractive therapeutic target in HCC, since
ROCK2 inhibitors may serve as both anti-metastasis and
chemo-sensitizing agents in HCC patients.

through repression of JAK [27]. In another report, Huang
et al also identified JAK2 to be a direct target of ROCK1
in hypothalamic cells [28]. In these two reports, JAK
phosphorylation was immediately abolished following
inhibition of ROCK within 30 minutes, indicating
that Rho/ROCK controls STAT3 signaling via direct
manipulation of p-JAK levels. In contrast, in our study,
the effect of Y27632 on suppressing the phosphorylation
of STAT3 in HCC cells was only observed after at least
24 hours of incubation. Therefore JAK is unlikely to be the
direct downstream target of ROCK in HCC and the effect
of STAT3 activation following ROCK activation may be
mediated by the increase in expression of autocrine IL-6,
as in the case of Rac1-regulated STAT3 activation [29].
NF-κB is one of the most well-studied regulators
of IL-6 expression [30]. Very recently, ROCK has been
reported to directly phosphorylate IKKβ [21]. It is
reasonable to hypothesize that ROCK mediates IL-6/
JAK2/STAT3 activation through direct regulation of IKK
phosphorylation. In support of this, our result showed
that transient inhibition of ROCK for 3 hours could

Materials and Methods

Xenograft assay

Cell lines, reagents and plasmids

6-week-old BALB/c-nu/nu athymic male nude mice
were used. All animals were provided by the Laboratory
Animal Unit of the University of Hong Kong. 2 × 106 cells
resuspended in 100 μL PBS were injected subcutaneously
into both sides of the mice’s back. For subcutaneous assay,
tumor was allowed to grow until it reached 100 mm3. For
orthotopic assay, tumor was allowed to grow for 1 week.
After that, cisplatin and/or Y27632 were administered every
3 days to the mice via intraperitoneal injection. The tumor
dimensions were also measured every 3 days. The volume
of the tumor was estimated with the following formula:
Tumor volume = shortest dimension × longest dimension2

Human HCC cell lines, SMMC-7721 and
BEL-7402 and immortalized normal liver cell line LO2
were obtained from Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology,
Chinese Academy of Sciences. MHCC-97L was a gift from
Fudan University (Dr. ZY Tang) of Shanghai. BEL-7402
and MHCC-97L cells are hepatitis B surface antigen
(HBsAg) positive. SMMC-7721, BEL-7402, MHCC-97L
and LO2 were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium with high glucose (Gibco-BRL, Carlsbad)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Y27632,
MG132, AG490 and BAY11-7082 were purchased from
Selleckchem (Houston). Cisplatin and doxorubicin were
purchased from Pharmachemie BV (Haarlem). The plasmids
for STAT3 and NFκB luciferase reporter assays were
constructed by cloning STAT3 and NFκB binding elements
into pGL3(Promega, Wisconsin) using NheI and BgIII.

Luciferase assay
5 × 104 cells were seeded in 24-well plate overnight.
Renilla luciferase was used as the normalization control.
Cells were transfected with 1 μg of total DNA of 1 (Renilla
luciferase plasmid):100 (firefly luciferase reporter plasmid)
using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Each sample was
repeated in triplicate. 48 hours after transfection, luciferase
assay was performed using the Dual-luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. The luminescence was measured by Infinite 200
(Tecan, Männedorf).

Real-time quantitative PCR (q-PCR)
RNA was extracted with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad). cDNA was synthesized with 1 μg of total RNA
using the Gold RNA PCR core kit (GeneAmp, Carlsbad)
and random primers. Quantitative PCR (q-PCR) was
performed in triplicate, using the SYBR® Green Real-Time
PCR Master Mixes and the Applied Biosystems 7900HT
Fast Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems,
Carlsbad) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

TCGA datasets
We collected transcriptomic data of HCC patients
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Gene expression
data (RNA-seq) were downloaded from cBioPortal [35].
Co-expression analysis was performed using Prism5.

Drug response assay
3 × 106 cells were seeded in 35-mm culture plates
24 hours prior to experiment. Cells were replenished with
2 mL fresh culture medium containing 20 µg/mL cisplatin
or 2 µg/mL doxorubicin and incubated at 37oC for 48 hours.
After 48 hours both dead flowing cells and live cells were
collected, resuspended in 1 mL PBS and were stained with
Trypan Blue. Live cells and dead cells were counted by
hematocytometer.

Statistics
Results are reported as mean ± SEM. Significance
was tested by 2-tailed Student’s t test. Mann–Whitney
U test was used to compare luciferase signal in lung
in xenograft mdoel. Cell proliferation rate and tumor
growth rate were tested by non-linear regression test.
Gene correlation was determined by Pearson correlation.
A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Annexin V apoptosis assay

Study approval

3 × 106 cells were seeded in 35-mm culture plates
24 hours prior to the experiment. Cells were replenished
with 2 mL fresh culture medium containing 20 µg/mL
cisplatin for 24 hours. After 24 hours, both dead flowing
cells and live cells were trypsinized and collected.
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Biosciences,
San Jose) was used according to manufacturer’s protocol.
The stained cells were analyzed by BD FACSCantoII
Analyzer (BD Biosciences).
