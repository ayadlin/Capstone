Abstract
Previous studies have shown that the DNA repair component Metnase (SETMAR) mediates resistance to DNA
damaging cancer chemotherapy. Metnase has a nuclease domain that shares homology with the Transposase
family. We therefore virtually screened the tertiary Metnase structure against the 550,000 compound ChemDiv
library to identify small molecules that might dock in the active site of the transposase nuclease domain of
Metnase. We identiﬁed eight compounds as possible Metnase inhibitors. Interestingly, among these candidate
inhibitors were quinolone antibiotics and HIV integrase inhibitors, which share common structural features.
Previous reports have described possible activity of quinolones as antineoplastic agents. Therefore, we chose the
quinolone ciproﬂoxacin for further study, based on its wide clinical availability and low toxicity. We found that
ciproﬂoxacin inhibits the ability of Metnase to cleave DNA and inhibits Metnase-dependent DNA repair.
Ciproﬂoxacin on its own did not induce DNA damage, but it did reduce repair of chemotherapy-induced DNA
damage. Ciproﬂoxacin increased the sensitivity of cancer cell lines and a xenograft tumor model to clinically
relevant chemotherapy. These studies provide a mechanism for the previously postulated antineoplastic activity
of quinolones, and suggest that ciproﬂoxacin might be a simple yet effective adjunct to cancer chemotherapy.

Introduction
Metnase is a recently characterized fusion protein comprising a SET histone methylase domain and a Transposase
nuclease domain. Metnase is a DNA repair component
present only in anthropoid primates (1–4). The Metnase
SET domain di-methylates histone H3 lysine 36 (H3K36),
whereas the Transposase nuclease domain has most but not
all of the known transposase activities, including 50 -terminal
inverted repeats (TIR)-speciﬁc DNA binding, DNA looping,
assembly of paired end complex, and DNA single-strand
cleavage (5, 6).

Metnase enhances nonhomologous end-joining and promotes genomic integration of foreign DNA (3). Both the SET
histone methylase and transposase nuclease domains are
essential for the enhancement of double-strand break (DSB)
repair. The transposase nuclease domain trims free DNA ends
to improve end-joining (6, 7), and the SET domain di-methylates H3K36 adjacent to induced DNA DSBs. This di-methylation stabilizes the Ku and MRN complex at the DSB, which
enhances DSB repair by nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ;
ref. 8). Interestingly, despite Metnase being present only in
primates, it functions seamlessly within the mouse NHEJ repair
apparatus to enhance DNA repair when expressed in those
cells (9). Metnase also helps suppress chromosomal translocations when 2 simultaneous DSBs are present, probably by
speeding proper local intrachromosomal NHEJ (9). Metnase
also regulates restart of collapsed replication forks, and promotes Topoisomerase IIa (Topo IIa) mediated chromosome
decatenation (7, 10–12).
Metnase is overexpressed in acute leukemia cells relative to
normal hematopoietic progenitors (12). Metnase overexpression in acute leukemia cells mediates resistance to etoposide,
and repressing Metnase restores sensitivity to this important
chemotherapeutic drug. Similarly, repressing Metnase in
breast cancer cells increased their sensitivity to the anthracycline Adriamycin (13). Thus, given that Metnase enhances
NHEJ DNA repair, repair of collapsed replication forks, and
resistance to certain DNA damaging chemotherapies, Metnase
represents an attractive clinical target for small molecule
inhibition that needs to be validated to get ﬁrst-in-class

anticancer molecules. In theory, small molecule inhibition of
Metnase should show an excellent therapeutic index, given
that it is overexpressed in malignant cells, and there are few
other human Transposase domain proteins with which to
cross-react (14).
Therefore, we virtually screened a large chemical library of
small compounds for docking into the Metnase nuclease active
site. We identiﬁed 8 compounds that ﬁt within our docking
parameters, including the quinolone gyrase inhibitor antibiotic, ciproﬂoxacin, and the HIV integrase inhibitors raltegravir
and elvitegravir. Quinolones have been reported to have some
antineoplastic activity, thought to be due to their ability to
inhibit Topo IIa, albeit at high concentrations not achievable
clinically (15). In this study, we found that high but clinically
achievable concentrations of ciproﬂoxacin blocked the ability
of Metnase to cleave DNA, which is essential for its DSB repair
activity (16). Ciproﬂoxacin inhibited DNA repair of a linearized
plasmid only in the presence of Metnase. We also found that
ciproﬂoxacin reduced DNA DSB repair in cells damaged by
chemotherapy, and enhanced the sensitivity of cancer cell lines
and a xenograft mouse tumor model to clinically relevant
chemotherapy. Thus, ciproﬂoxacin is a Metnase inhibitor that
enhances cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy by reducing
DNA repair.

Materials and Methods
Virtual screening
An approach composed by target-based virtual screening
(TBVS) and ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) was established to select new chemicals (Supplementary Fig. S1). We
used LBVS to query the ChemDiv catalog of available chemical structures (more than 550,000) for compounds of potential interest, as described (17). The HIV integrase inhibitors
raltegravir and elvitegravir were chosen as ligands for this
screen as they virtually docked into the Metnase transposase
domain. Two-dimensional models were built using SMDL
ﬁngerprints encoding the chemical structures of those compounds. A Tanimoto similarity index then compared the
ChemDiv molecules with raltegravir and elvitegravir using a
75% cutoff value. Three-dimensional ﬁlters with ROCS v.
2.4.1 (Openeye Inc) were used to choose molecules with the
highest similarities to the queries using the Combo similarity index. ChemDiv molecules sharing less than 50% overall
similarity with the integrase inhibitors were discarded.
Pharmacokinetics/toxicity properties of the compounds
were predicted using Volsurf v. 3 (Molecular Discovery Inc).
All 3D conformations for the new molecules were generated
by the OMEGA software (v. 2.3.2, Openeye Inc.) with the
following modiﬁcations to the default: wider energy window
(eWindow 15) and a lower root mean square cutoff to
compare each conformation (RMS of 0.3).
The Metnase transposase domain was modeled by using
the bioinformatics tools Fugue and Orchestrar in the
Sybyl8.0 software suite (Tripos) using the 3D structure of
MOS-1 transposase from Drosophila mauritiana as a template, Supplementary Fig. S2. The high accuracy of the
modeled transposase domain structure was veriﬁed after
a comparison with the published Metnase X-ray crystallo-

www.aacrjournals.org

graphic structures after they became available (PDB codes:
3F2K, 3K9J, 3K9K; ref. 18). All structures were superimposed
using DeepView v. 4.0.1 and the root mean square deviation
was calculated using all atoms (0.94 Å) and the alpha
carbons (0.90 Å), which yielded excellent superimposition,
Supplementary Fig. S3.
TBVS was then conducted using the Fast Rigid Exhaustive
Docking program (FRED v. 2.2.5, Openeye Inc.) to dock all
conformations of compounds into the Metnase Transposase
domain. Chemgauss3 was the scoring function, as it was the
only one that had a parameterization for the metal atom
(Mg2þ) present at the active site. A threshold score of 20
(with a tolerance of 2) was kept for the chelation property.
DNA binding and nuclease inhibition assays
Flag-tagged recombinant Metnase was puriﬁed as previously described (7), and used to biochemically test the
inhibitory activity of the candidate docking compounds.
Inhibition of Metnase's TIR-speciﬁc DNA-binding activity
was examined using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay
as we previously described (7). Inhibition of Metnase's 50 overhang cleavage activity was tested using a 50 -32P-labeled
oligomer DNA with a pseudo Y structure as we previously
described (16).
Colony formation and cell proliferation assays
Colony formation was conducted as we described (13). We
monitored proliferation in the presence of chemotherapy and
candidate Metnase inhibitors to assess antiproliferative effects
on leukemia cells by using cell counting assays conducted in
triplicate as described (12).
Generation of stable Metnase over- and underexpressing
cells
Stable HEK293T vector control and Metnase overexpressing
cells and HEK293 vector control and Metnase knockdown cells
were generated as we described previously (10, 13).
Direct NHEJ repair assay
NHEJ DSB repair was directly assayed using intracellular
plasmid end-joining as we described (3, 19). All statistical
analysis was conducted by using unpaired t tests unless
otherwise speciﬁed.
Rate of disappearance of g-H2Ax foci
g-H2Ax foci were analyzed in A549 cells as we described
(10, 19). The data are the composite of 3 experiments  SEM.
BrdUrd immunoﬂuorescence
A549 cells were seeded and treated above except that at
24 hours intervals, 0.03 mg/mL BrdUrd was added to the cells
for 1 hour before ﬁxing and processing for immunostaining
using a BrdUrd-speciﬁc antibody (Cell Signaling) according to
the manufacturer's instructions. Images were collected using
an EVOS ﬂuorescence microscope (Advanced Microscopy
Group). Percentage BrdUrd-positive values are averages
(þSEM) of 4 to 9 ﬁelds with 102 to 642 cells (average ¼ 243)
scored per condition.

5  106 A549 human lung cancer cells were injected into
each ﬂank of a severe combined immunodeﬁcient (SCID)
mouse and allowed to grow for 14 days, then tumor volumes
were measured and treatment started. The mice were treated
with a 1-week run-in of ciproﬂoxacin (2 mg/kg daily). Then
mice were exposed to concurrent ciproﬂoxacin (2 mg/kg daily)
and cisplatin (2 mg/kg 3 times/week). Tumor volumes were
measured 3 times per week. Results were plotted as relative
tumor growth for the ﬁrst day of each week of treatment up to
the ﬁnal day.

Results
Virtual screening for Metnase inhibitors
We previously found that the nuclease activity of Metnase
resided within its transposase domain, and this domain was
required for its DNA repair activity (3, 7). The catalytic core of
the Metnase transposase nuclease site comprises a single
magnesium ion coordinated by oxygens from D483, E575, and
4 water molecules, based on the 3F2K X-ray structure (18). The
remainder of the nuclease pocket comprises neutral or positively charged amino acids that anchor the DNA by means of
ionic interactions with phosphates along the DNA backbone
(Supplementary Fig. S4).
LBVS was used to screen the ChemDiv library of greater
than 550,000 small molecule compounds for potential Metnase nuclease domain inhibitors. The ligands chosen as
models for this virtual screening were the HIV integrase
inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir (20, 21). Three-dimensional structures of the compounds identiﬁed in LBVS were
then subjected to TBVS for further selection, using FRED as
the docking tool (Fig. 1). Eight compounds were selected for
biochemical analysis based on docking scores (especially
considering their Mg2þ chelation property, depicted in Fig.
1), lack of known toxic moieties, and favorable pharmacokinetics. The compounds in the ChemDiv library chosen
for biochemical testing were 5483-0023, 3731-0098 (ciproﬂoxacin), R092-0025, 8017-3379, D058-0127, D045-0007, raltegravir, and elvitegravir. A carboxylic acid moiety and an
aromatic or heteroaromatic ring compose the chemical
scaffold of all the compounds except raltegravir, which has
a 5-hydroxypyrimidinone moiety that can be partially protonated in pH 7. All molecules share good Mg2þ chelation
chemotypes because they were considered as pharmacophores throughout the virtual screening procedure. The
chelation properties of raltegravir and elvitegravir were
already described in X-ray structures of the integrase
domain of prototype foamy virus (PFV; ref. 22).
Biochemical analysis of the candidate inhibitors
Inhibition of Metnase's DNA binding activity by the above
compounds was examined using puriﬁed recombinant human
Metnase protein as we described (6, 7). Metnase binds duplex
TIR DNA, a characteristic of transposase domain proteins

(1, 5). The ability of these compounds to inhibit TIR DNA
binding was assessed using mobility shift assays (Fig. 2A). None
of the selected compounds were able to inhibit TIR-speciﬁc
DNA binding by Metnase. Metnase recognizes and cleaves
pseudo Y structures near the 50 end (6). We therefore determined whether the 8 potential Metnase inhibitors could block
this activity. Signiﬁcantly, raltegravir, elvitegravir, and ciproﬂoxacin (3731-0098) were highly effective in blocking Metnase
cleavage of the 50 end of the pseudo Y substrate. The remaining
compounds either had no effect or seemed to stimulate
Metnase nuclease activity. We selected ciproﬂoxacin for

Metnase inhibition increases sensitivity to
chemotherapy
Common solid tumors such as those from lung or colon are
difﬁcult to treat once metastatic because of their low sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. The solid tumor A549 lung
cancer and SW48 colon cancer cell lines were tested for
potentiation of cell killing by clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents with ciproﬂoxacin by using colony formation
assays. Ciproﬂoxacin concentrations used were clinically
achievable, based on early phase clinical trials (23). Ciproﬂoxacin has shown some activity alone against A549 cells in vitro (P
< 0.01), and it signiﬁcantly enhanced cisplatin-induced cell
killing (P < 0.01, Fig. 3A). Ciproﬂoxacin alone had no effect on
SW48 colony formation, and the approximately 2-fold reduc-

tion in colony formation with ciproﬂoxacin plus 5-ﬂuorouracil
(5-FU) compared with 5-FU alone did not reach statistical
signiﬁcance (P > 0.1; Fig. 3B).
We next measured proliferation of the acute myeloid leukemia cell line KG-1 over 4 days in the presence of ciproﬂoxacin
with and without etoposide (Fig. 3C). Ciproﬂoxacin alone
resulted in a signiﬁcant inhibition of proliferation of this
leukemia cell line (P < 0.01), similar to our observations with
the THP-1 acute monocytic leukemia cell line when Metnase
was repressed by siRNA (12). Acute leukemia cells seem
especially reliant on Metnase for proliferation (12). Ciproﬂoxacin also enhanced the antiproliferative effects of etoposide (P
< 0.01), but under these conditions the effect of ciproﬂoxacin
plus etoposide was not signiﬁcantly different than ciproﬂoxacin alone (P > 0.1; Fig. 3C).
Therefore we have shown that ciproﬂoxacin can potentiate
the effects of 3 different chemotherapeutic drugs on 3 different
types of cognate cancer cells. We did test ciproﬂoxacin with
appropriate chemotherapy on other cancer cell lines, but it was

Thus, ciproﬂoxacin inhibits repair only when Metnase is
present in the HEK293T cells. Next, we examined whether
ciproﬂoxacin altered the nuclease resection of the free DNA
ends of the transfected plasmid subjected to intracellular NHEJ
in this assay. Ciproﬂoxacin decreased the resection of end
deletion of the transfected linearized plasmid DNA (Fig. 4C).
Then we tested NHEJ repair using the same assay in HEK293
cells (normally expressing Metnase) with Metnase repressed
using shRNA (Fig. 4D). As we have seen previously, a reduction
in Metnase protein expression results in a signiﬁcant decrease
in DNA repair compared with the parental control cells (Fig.
4D). The presence of ciproﬂoxacin signiﬁcantly reduced this
repair even further (Fig. 4D), probably as the HEK293-shMetnase cells still express some Metnase protein (Fig. 4A). These
results show that ciproﬂoxacin is likely acting speciﬁcally on
Metnase as in the complete absence of Metnase the endogenous DNA repair pathway of HEK293T cells is not inhibited by
ciproﬂoxacin.

not as effective (data not shown). Therefore, ciproﬂoxacin has
speciﬁcity for certain cancers or chemotherapies.
Metnase inhibition decreases NHEJ repair
The in vitro results above conﬁrmed the biologic activity of
ciproﬂoxacin as a Metnase nuclease inhibitor, supporting the
virtual screening outcome. The in vivo assays also suggest that
ciproﬂoxacin affects Metnase function to enhance the efﬁcacy
of chemotherapy. However, the in vivo assays above do not
differentiate between ciproﬂoxacin acting only on Metnase or
whether it is having other effects, such as generating DNA
damage by itself.
Previously we had shown that nuclease-deﬁcient Metnase
protein cannot enhance DNA repair (3, 16). To examine
whether ciproﬂoxacin speciﬁcally inhibited the Metnase nuclease domain's ability to enhance NHEJ DSB repair, we conducted an NHEJ plasmid repair assay in cells that express
varying levels of Metnase protein, in the presence and absence
of ciproﬂoxacin. HEK293T cells were used as they do not
express any endogenous Metnase (11). HEK293T parental cells
were able to repair the linearized plasmid efﬁciently but this
repair was not signiﬁcantly affected by ciproﬂoxacin (Fig. 4B).
Metnase transduced HEK293T were also able to efﬁciently
repair the plasmid, but the addition of ciproﬂoxacin signiﬁcantly decreased (P < 0.01) the repair of this plasmid (Fig. 4B).

Metnase inhibition blocks repair of chemotherapyinduced DNA damage
We therefore asked whether (i) ciproﬂoxacin generates DNA
damage on its own, (ii) whether it inhibits repair of DNA
damage induced by chemotherapeutic agents, and (iii) whether it prevents stalled replication forks from restarting. The
presence of g-H2Ax immunoﬂuorescent foci after DNA damage
is a measure of DNA DSBs, and the rate of their disappearance
is an assay of DNA DSB repair (24, 25). With cisplatin, these
likely represent stalled replication forks that have collapsed to
yield free double-strand ends. We previously showed that
siRNA knockdown of Metnase slows the rate of disappearance
of g-H2Ax foci after replication fork stalling, indicating that
Metnase enhances repair of collapsed forks (10, 19). We scored
g-H2Ax foci in A549 lung cancer cells at various times after
treatment with cisplatin, ciproﬂoxacin, or both (Fig. 4E and F).
The percentage of cells with g-H2Ax foci was the same in the
ciproﬂoxacin-treated compared with untreated A549 cells.
Also, ciproﬂoxacin did not increase the percentage of cells
with g-H2Ax foci immediately after cisplatin relative to cisplatin treatment alone. Thus, ciproﬂoxacin does not induce
DSBs on its own, nor does it enhance the DNA damaging effects
of cisplatin. However, g-H2Ax foci disappeared at a faster rate
in cells treated with cisplatin alone compared with the cells
treated with both ciproﬂoxacin and cisplatin (Fig. 4D and E).
The differences were statistically signiﬁcant at 24, 48, and 72
hours after cisplatin exposure. These results have shown that
cisplatin DNA DSB damage, likely from collapsed replication
forks, is repaired more slowly in cells co-treated with ciproﬂoxacin, similar to what was seen in cells with repressed
Metnase expression (10, 19). This is further evidence that
ciproﬂoxacin inhibits Metnase function.
If free double-strand ends from collapsed replication forks
are repaired more slowly when cisplatin is in the presence of
ciproﬂoxacin, it was possible that ciproﬂoxacin also decreased
replication fork progression after cisplatin treatment. To
address this A549 cells were treated as above and harvested
at the same time points as the g-H2Ax assay, but were pulsed
with BrdUrd 30 minutes before harvesting. Incorporated

Therapeutically Targeting Transposase Domains

Figure 4. Ciproﬂoxacin (Cipro) suppresses DNA repair in Metnase-expressing cells. A, over- and underexpression of Metnase in HEK293T (which do not
normally express Metnase secondary to T-antigen transformation) or HEK293 cells (normally expressing Metnase), respectively, monitored by Western blot
analysis with b-actin as loading control. Lanes marked as C are empty vector controls. B, NHEJ repair of linearized, transfected plasmid DNA in HEK293T cells,
which do not express Metnase, was not signiﬁcantly affected by ciproﬂoxacin (gray bars; P ¼ 0.43, t test). Ciproﬂoxacin reduced NHEJ by 4- to 5-fold
in cells overexpressing Metnase (in A–C and F;  , P < 0.05 and   , P < 0.01). C, in HEK293T cells overexpressing Metnase, a smaller fraction of NHEJ deletions
were greater than 100 bp in length (Fisher exact test). D, ciproﬂoxacin reduces plasmid NHEJ in HEK293 cells (gray bars), and NHEJ is also reduced in
untreated cells when Metnase expression is reduced with shRNA. NHEJ levels were not signiﬁcantly (NS) different in ciproﬂoxacin-treated HEK293 cells
expressing normal versus low levels of Metnase. Ciproﬂoxacin still reduced NHEJ in HEK293 cells underexpressing Metnase (black bars), probably
reﬂecting inhibition of residual Metnase (A, lower blot). E and F, ciproﬂoxacin reduces resolution of g-H2Ax foci after chemotherapy. A549 cells were seeded
onto coverslips and allowed to adhere. Ciproﬂoxacin (2 mmol/L) was added for 18 hours before chemotherapy. Cisplatin was added for 6 hours, and then
washed off and new culture medium was added containing ciproﬂoxacin where appropriate. Cells were ﬁxed and processed for immunoﬂuorescence
with an antibody speciﬁc for g-H2Ax and 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) counterstained. Representative images after 48 hours recovery are shown in E,
and quantiﬁcation of all time points is shown in F. Cells with greater than 5 foci per cell were considered positive. Ciproﬂoxacin alone did not generate
DNA damage as shown by unchanged g-H2Ax foci. The combination of cisplatin and ciproﬂoxacin resulted in a slower resolution of g-H2Ax foci than cisplatin
alone. G, ciproﬂoxacin does not affect DNA replication restart after cisplatin. BrdUrd incorporation was scored in A549 cells, treated with cisplatin and
ciproﬂoxacin as in F, at indicated times after release from cisplatin. UT, untreated.

BrdUrd indicates a cell with replication fork progression after
cisplatin exposure. We found that at all time points and for all
treatments there was no difference in the fraction of BrdUrdpositive cells (Fig. 4G). Therefore, inhibition of Metnase by
ciproﬂoxacin does not affect the overall fraction of cells with
replication fork progression, but does decrease repair of DSBs
caused by those forks that have collapsed, which would be in a
subset of the BrdUrd-positive cells.
Metnase inhibition increases response of a lung cancer
xenograft to chemotherapy
We then addressed whether ciproﬂoxacin inhibition of
Metnase could improve therapeutic efﬁcacy in an in vivo model
of malignancy. We used a SCID murine xenograft tumor model
with A549 lung cancer cells (26–29). To model human malignancy, tumors were allowed to form for 14 days after injection
of the cells into the ﬂanks of mice before chemotherapy was

started. Xenograft tumor experiments were conducted 3 independent times with at least 5 mice per group using clinical
achievable concentrations of ciproﬂoxacin and the results are
shown in Fig. 5. The vehicle-treated tumors had a volume
doubling time of approximately 8 days, which is in accord with
previous studies (29, 30). In this system, ciproﬂoxacin alone
had no effect on the rate of growth of the A549 xenografts. We
used a clinically relevant cisplatin dose, but it had little effect
on the growth of the A549 xenografts. Interestingly, the ciproﬂoxacin/cisplatin combination signiﬁcantly reduced growth
of the A549 tumors compared with untreated controls (P < 0.01
at weeks 5 and 6). Tumors in mice treated with both drugs
showed little or no increase in volume after 1 week of combination therapy, until the experiments were stopped 6 weeks
after initial injection because of the large expansions in tumor
volumes in control and single drug-treated mice. Moreover,
tumors in mice treated with both ciproﬂoxacin and cisplatin

Figure 5. Ciproﬂoxacin increases human lung cancer xenograft sensitivity
to cisplatin. A549 lung cancer cells, normally resistant to cisplatin, were
injected into the ﬂanks of mice, allowed to establish for 2 weeks, then
treated daily with ciproﬂoxacin and 3 times weekly with cisplatin. Tumor
volumes were measured 3 times per week and relative tumor volumes at
each time point were calculated as tumor volume at that time divided by
the tumor volume at the beginning of treatment (2 weeks after injection).
Values are average relative tumor volumes (SEM) for 15 to 26 tumors per
condition (average of 23 tumors). Ciproﬂoxacin alone had no effect on
xenograft growth, and cisplatin had a minimal effect on xenograft growth
alone. However, the combination showed a statistically signiﬁcant
inhibition of xenograft growth after 4 weeks of treatment.  , P < 0.05;

showed signiﬁcantly reduced growth compared with mice
treated with cisplatin alone (P < 0.05 at weeks 5 and 6). The
A549 xenograft results parallel our ﬁndings with A549 cancer
cells in tissue culture (Fig. 3A), and they conﬁrmed that
ciproﬂoxacin enhances sensitivity of A549 lung cancer cells
to cisplatin in vivo.

Discussion
We have shown that reducing the expression of Metnase in
several cancer cell lines increased their sensitivity to their
clinically relevant chemotherapeutic agents (12, 13). Therefore,
we hypothesized that targeting Metnase with small-molecule
inhibitors would be a novel and potentially important means to
enhance cancer chemotherapy. We used both ligand-based
and target-based virtual screening tools to identify compounds
in the ChemDiv library that could both dock into the Metnase
Transposase nuclease active site and that had structural
properties common to useful drugs, including lack of toxicity
moieties, and that were predicted to have good pharmacokinetic properties. We screened 8 of the top scoring compounds
for biochemical inhibition of the nuclease activity of Metnase,
and found 3 compounds indeed had inhibitory capability: the
HIV integrase inhibitors raltegravir and elvitegravir, and the
quinolone antibiotic ciproﬂoxacin. Elvitegravir and ciproﬂoxacin are quite similar, sharing a quinolone moiety at one end
predicted to interact with the chelated Mg2þ in the HIV
integrase and Metnase Transposase domains.
We chose not to pursue elvitegravir because it is not FDAapproved, and thus clinical trials would be more difﬁcult to
conduct. Raltegravir and ciproﬂoxacin are both FDA-approved
for clinical use, and they are both very safe, even in high
concentrations (31, 32). They are also both highly bioavailable

in oral dosing. Ciproﬂoxacin was chosen for our initial studies
because previous reports indicated that quinolones have antiproliferative activity in several cancer cell lines (15, 33–39). It
had been hypothesized that the antiproliferative activity of
quinolones were due to inhibition of Topo IIa (15, 39). Because
Metnase is in a complex with Topo IIa, and Metnase strongly
enhances Topo IIa activity (11), it is possible that the previously reported antineoplastic activity of quinolones attributed
to Topo IIa inhibition may be at least in part indirect, from
inhibition of Metnase, which in turn resulted in Topo IIa
inhibition. We have ongoing studies designed to test whether
ciproﬂoxacin, raltegravir, and/or elvitegravir inhibit Topo IIamediated chromosome decatenation, as this is another potential mechanism by which these drugs could enhance tumor
killing. Ciproﬂoxacin could also have off-target activity due to
its Mg2þ chelation property. Topo IIa is an example of an
essential cellular enzyme that has a magnesium atom at the
catalytic site (40). This is consistent with the mechanism for
which quinolones were designed, against bacterial topoisomerases (41). However, the studies here showing that ciproﬂoxacin only decreased DNA DSB repair when Metnase was
present imply that Metnase is the main target of ciproﬂoxacin
for its enhancement of cisplatin cytotoxicity seen here. This
may be due to the relatively lower concentrations used here
compared with other studies. At higher concentrations, it is
possible that ciproﬂoxacin would have additional activities, as
has been reported in refs. 33–38. It should be noted that Tantigen–transformed cell lines, such as the HEK293T cells used
here, are the only types of cells that do not require Metnase;
thus, ciproﬂoxacin has less effect on repair in those cells. Other
cells with Metnase expression seem to be addicted to its
presence, requiring it for repair of DSBs and collapsed replication forks (10–13).
We showed that ciproﬂoxacin alone could slow the growth
of the KG-1 leukemia cell line, similar to our previous observation of reduced leukemia cell growth when Metnase protein
expression was repressed (12). We also found that ciproﬂoxacin could increase chemosensitivity to several therapeutic
agents in clinically relevant solid tumor cancer cell lines.
Clinically relevant concentrations of ciproﬂoxacin alone did
not decrease solid tumor cell line colony formation or induce
DNA damage, nor did it increase the amount of DNA damage
induced by the chemotherapeutic cisplatin, as revealed by
g-H2Ax foci. However, ciproﬂoxacin signiﬁcantly decreased
the rate of disappearance of g-H2Ax foci induced by cisplatin.
This ﬁnding indicates that ciproﬂoxacin reduces the rate of
repair of damaged DNA, with the likely mechanism being
inhibition of Metnase nuclease activity, as this inhibition of
repair is present only when Metnase is present. The slow repair
rate seen with ciproﬂoxacin is similar to that seen previously
when Metnase was repressed in cells treated with DNA damaging and replication stress agents (10, 12). Therefore, we
suggest that ciproﬂoxacin enhances chemotherapy by inhibiting the ability of Metnase to repair collapsed replication forks.
Cancer therapies typically involve direct or indirect induction
of DNA damage, and ciproﬂoxacin may be a useful adjunct to
treatments of many types of cancers. Some types of cancers
overexpress Metnase (12), and in these cases ciproﬂoxacin may

Therapeutically Targeting Transposase Domains

provide even greater therapeutic beneﬁts. Other quinolones
may also be beneﬁcial, although careful preclinical testing is
important as several of the candidate quinolones identiﬁed in
our virtual screen seemed to stimulate rather than inhibit
Metnase nuclease activity (Fig. 2B).
Previous studies have shown that ciproﬂoxacin alone can
inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in bladder cancer,
prostate cancer, colon cancer, and leukemia cell lines. For
example, ciproﬂoxacin decreases proliferation of a number of
cancer cell lines, including A549, albeit at concentrations
higher than used here (38). Proliferation of human prostate
cancer cells and Jurkat acute leukemia cells was repressed by
ciproﬂoxacin (42, 43). Ciproﬂoxacin also induces apoptosis in
colon cancer cells, perhaps by inhibiting repair of endogenous
DNA damage (36). All of these studies showed that ciproﬂoxacin has independent antiproliferative activity; however,
higher ciproﬂoxacin concentrations were used in those studies
than in the current study. We propose that ciproﬂoxacin not be
discarded as an antineoplastic agent based on the concentrations used in the prior studies, but rather that it be delivered as
an adjunct to DNA damaging chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
Quinolone derivatives are being generated and explored as
more potent anticancer drugs. The quinolone derivative voreloxin is being tested in clinical trials in several types of
malignancies. Voreloxin alone increases DNA damage by
intercalating into DNA. It also acts as a Topo IIa poison, and
can be synergistic with known chemotherapy (44). The drug
has some activity in acute myeloid leukemia (39). A recent
study found that voreloxin had little independent activity in
relapsed non–small cell lung cancer (45). However, given the
results of the present study, voreloxin might have more efﬁcacy
as an inhibitor of cisplatin adducts repair and/or recovery of
stalled replication forks. Another quinolone, CHM-1, is being
tested for clinical activity in treating human malignancy (46,
47). Interestingly, CHM-1 induces DNA damage and decreases
expression of DNA repair genes (48).
A meta-analysis of randomized trials of quinolones for
infections during cancer therapy found that mortality in cancer
patients was reduced for those on quinolones (49). The authors
recognized that it was possible that this reduction in mortality
was secondary to reducing infections. However, a follow-up
analysis extracted infection-related mortality data from the
primary trials used in the previous analysis, and assessed the
effect of quinolones on cancer-related mortality. Among trials
comparing quinolones with placebo or no treatment, a signif-

icant reduction in noninfection-related mortality was observed
in the quinolone arm (50). This ﬁnding is compatible with an
anticancer effect of quinolone antibiotics when combined with
other chemotherapy, consistent with the data presented here.
It is possible that this effect is due to potentiation of DNAdamaging chemotherapy by inhibition of Metnase. If so, adding
adjunct ciproﬂoxacin represents a novel method of enhancing
chemotherapy that is amenable to immediate clinical trial
assessment.
