Abstract
Metformin is an anti-diabetic drug with a promising anti-cancer potential. In
this study, we show that subtoxic doses of metformin effectively sensitize human
colorectal cancer (CRC) cells to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
ligand (TRAIL), which induces apoptosis. Metformin alone did not induce apoptosis,
but significantly potentiated TRAIL-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. CRC cells treated
with metformin and TRAIL showed activation of the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways
of caspase activation. We attempted to elucidate the underlying mechanism, and
found that metformin significantly reduced the protein levels of myeloid cell leukemia
1 (Mcl-1) in CRC cells and, the overexpression of Mcl-1 inhibited cell death induced
by metformin and/or TRAIL. Further experiments revealed that metformin did not
affect mRNA levels, but increased proteasomal degradation and protein stability of
Mcl-1. Knockdown of Mule triggered a significant decrease of Mcl-1 polyubiquitination.
Metformin caused the dissociation of Noxa from Mcl-1, which allowed the binding
of the BH3-containing ubiquitin ligase Mule followed by Mcl-1ubiquitination and
degradation. The metformin-induced degradation of Mcl-1 required E3 ligase Mule,
which is responsible for the polyubiquitination of Mcl-1. Our study is the first report
indicating that metformin enhances TRAIL-induced apoptosis through Noxa and
favors the interaction between Mcl-1 and Mule, which consequently affects Mcl-1
ubiquitination.

INTRODUCTION

20 months when monoclonal antibody therapies such as
cetuximab and bevacizumab were used [3–5]. Despite
these advances, there remains a lack of effective drugs to
improve overall survival in patients with CRC. Therefore,
development of new therapies for metastatic CRC is urgent.
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosisinducing ligand (TRAIL), a death ligand and a promising
anticancer drug, is a member of the TNF-α superfamily
that binds to the death receptors TRAIL-R1 (DR4) [6, 7]
and TRAIL-R2 (DR5) [8, 9]. While TRAIL generally does
not induce normal primary cell death, TRAIL-mediated

Colorectal cancer (CRC), both the third most common
form of cancer and the third leading cause of cancerrelated death worldwide, can attribute its effect in part to
the metastases of its parent tumor [1]. Numerous studies
have recently made remarkable advances in the search for
a cure for metastatic CRC. For instance, the addition of
irinotecan and oxaliplatin to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) increased
the median overall survival of 1 year [2]. Median overall
survival was also increased by nearly a factor of two to

death of tumor cells occurs via extrinsic and intrinsic celldeath signaling pathways [10]. In the extrinsic pathway,
DR-mediated apoptosis occurs when TRAIL binds to DRformed trimers of the TRAIL receptors, adaptor proteins,
Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD), and
caspase-8, to form the death-inducing signaling complex
(DISC) during cell death. The activation of caspase-8
leads quickly to the formation of caspase-3 (activation
form), which consequently induces cancer cell apoptosis.
The intrinsic pathway is also called the mitochondriadependent apoptosis pathway. Previous studies show
that TRAIL-induced cell death can be promoted by
combinational treatment with various anticancer drugs
at minimal toxic doses in tumor cells [11–13]. Recent
reports, however, indicate that various types of cancers are
resistant to TRAIL [14]. Therefore, treatment with TRAIL
alone may be insufficient to overcome resistance. Thus,
understanding the roles that TRAIL play and the discovery
of effective sensitizers for TRAIL-mediated cancer
therapy are the major challenges for the development of
novel therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment.
While promising results have been reported in
Chinese phase III clinical trials in which TRAIL has been
used as an anti-cancer therapy, resistance to TRAILinduced apoptosis remains a main obstacle in its future
clinical application. Many recent reports have focused on
improving TRAIL sensitization as a way to mediate tumor
cell death. Using this strategy, several novel anticancer
drugs that are capable of increasing sensitization to
TRAIL have been developed. For instance, wogonin,
capsaicin, verrucarin A, curcumin, epigallocatechin
gallate, and resveratrol, among others, have been reported
to sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL-induced cell death,
mostly through the cell surface receptor pathway via upregulation of DR5/DR4 through c-FLIP [15–20]. Studies
have also showed that TRAIL-induced cell death can be
regulated via the intrinsic pathway. By inhibiting two antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, or by increasing
the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bax, Bim,
and Bcl-xs, the sensitivity of many cancers to TRAIL
treatments can be enhanced [20].
In addition, resistance to TRAIL among different
types of cancer poses a major obstacle to effective therapy
[21, 22]. Therefore, scientists are in search for compounds
that sensitize tumor cells to TRAIL and reverse resistance
in tumor cells. This line of inquiry is important because,
while approximately 60% of human tumors have been
found to be TRAIL-resistant, the mechanism of resistance
is poorly understood [23–26].
In the current study, we sought to assess the possible
sensitizing effect of metformin on TRAIL-mediated cell
death in CRC cells. In recent studies, diabetic patients
receiving metformin (Figure 1A), a commonly used
medication to lower blood glucose [27, 28], had decreased
cancer mortality and a reduced risk of developing cancer
[29–32]. Moreover, metformin sensitizes human cancer cells
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to classical anti-cancer agents, such as dasatinib, paclitaxel,
and aspirin [33–35]. In preclinical studies, metformin
inhibited proliferation, invasion, and migration of pancreatic
cancer cells [36, 37] while it improved the survival
outcomes of patients with CRC and diabetes in previous
studies [38]. Notably, for the first time, our data shows that
combining TRAIL and low doses of nonapoptosis-inducing
metformin enhance apoptosis in human CRC cell lines. We
also present the first evidence that metformin upregulates
Bax and downregulates Mcl-1 as well as synergistically
increases TRAIL-mediated cell death in human CRC cell
lines.

Results
Combination of metformin and TRAIL
synergistically enhances CRC cell death, but not
that of normal primary colon cells
Metformin has been previously reported to induce
apoptosis in several cell types such as human cervical
cancer, human ovarian, human leukemia, and human
CRC [39–42]. Before investigating the effect of combined
treatment with metformin and TRAIL on viability of CRC
cells, we evaluated whether metformin alone induces cell
death. CRC cells were exposed to 2.5–10 mM metformin
for 24 h. Here, we found that metformin-induced cell
death in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 1B). Cancer cell
lines displayed various levels of sensitivity, but normal
primary colon cells (FHC) were resistant to the drug. In
normal colorectal cells, minimal cytotoxicity (7% killing)
was observed at a high dose (10 mM) of metformin, while
in the CRC cell lines, sensitivity was observed even at
2.5 mM. The effect of treatment with a combination of
metformin and TRAIL was investigated in several CRC
cell lines as well as FHC cells. Cytotoxicity was induced
by TRAIL alone, in FHC cells in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 1C). Cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced
by combined treatment with metformin and TRAIL in
TRAIL-sensitive HCT116 cells and TRAIL-resistant
DLD-1, HT29, and Colo205 cells (Figure 1E), but not
in normal primary colon cells (FHC) (Figure 1D). These
results suggest that the sensitizing regimen of metformin
plus TRAIL may be selectively toxic to CRC cells.

Metformin facilitates TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in CRC cells through activation of extrinsic and
intrinsic pathway
We further investigated the synergistic interactions
between metformin and TRAIL. First, the effect of
metformin in combination with TRAIL on DLD-1 cell
morphology was examined and photographed under a light
microscope. After the application of TRAIL or metformin
in combination with TRAIL, as shown in Figure 2A,
cell morphology changed significantly when compared
59504

to control cells or cells treated with only metformin.
Apoptotic cell death with morphological characterstics
such as nuclear condensation, cell shrinkage, and
blebbing was observed. Cells with morphological changes
were counted and statistical significance was calculated
(Figure 2A). Additionally, we investigated the longterm effect on clonogenic survival in a cell culture of
metformin and TRAIL combination. The metformin and
TRAIL combination was much more potent than either
agent alone in inhibiting colony formation, in agreement
with the apoptosis study. In fact, almost all colonies were
eliminated, although metformin or TRAIL alone inhibited
the formation and growth of colonies only partially
(Figure 2B). Thus, we found that combined treatment
with metformin and TRAIL synergistically induced cell
death in contrast to metformin or TRAIL alone in CRC
cell lines (Figure 1D). We also employed an Annexin V
assay, PARP-1 cleavage assay, and cleavage of caspase
8/9 to clarify whether the effect of metformin on TRAILmediated cell death was related to apoptosis. As shown in
Figure 2C and 2D, we found that, while TRAIL induced
apoptosis, metformin increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis
in CRC cells. Furthermore, data from biochemical analysis
show that, in DLD-1 cells, metformin substantially
promoted TRAIL-induced activation of caspase-3, -8, and
-9, leading to increased PARP cleavage (Figure 2E). We
also used pretreatment with z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase
inhibitor, to determine that combined treatment with
metformin and TRAIL significantly attenuated PARP
cleavage (Figure 2F). These results show that increased
apoptosis produced by metformin begins through an
elevation of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways.

over-expression of Mcl-1 inhibited DLD-1’s sensitizing
effect on TRAIL-induced cell death. Further, knockdown
of Mcl-1 by silencing RNA elevated TRAIL-induced
cell death (Figure 3D), indicating that, in CRC cells, the
sensitizing effect of metformin occurs through downregulation of Mcl-1 levels.

Metformin induces Mcl-1 degradation via the
ubiquitin-proteasome signaling pathway
Next, we investigated whether metformin increased
or decreased the level of apoptotic regulatory molecules.
As shown in Figure 3A, no significant alterations in
levels of the detected apoptotic regulatory proteins were
observed, although the expression of Mcl-1 decreased in
a dose-dependent manner in the metformin-treated cells
within 16 h (Supplementary Figure S1). Therefore, we
examined whether metformin modulates Mcl-1 mRNA
expression. However, metformin does not affect Mcl1 mRNA transcription level (Figure 4A and 4B). When
DLD-1 cells were or were not exposed to metformin in
the presence of 10 μg/ml cyclohexamide (CHX) for the
indicated time periods, metformin decreased the Mcl-1
protein stability in DLD-1 cells (Figure 4C). Consistently,
in the presence of CHX, the rate of degradation of
Mcl-1 was significantly greater in metformin-treated
cells than in non-treated ones. These results show that
metformin decreases Mcl-1 levels through activation of
the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathways. Also,
several studies have proven that the degradation of Mcl-1
is generally regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome
pathway [43]. Therefore, we investigated whether
metformin also modulates Mcl-1 expression via the
ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. First, we investigated the
effect of the proteasome inhibitor (MG132) on metformininduced Mcl-1 degradation. As shown in Figure 4D
and  4E, MG132 significantly inhibited the metformininduced down-regulation of Mcl-1. These results indicate
that metformin-induced Mcl-1 degradation is mainly
ubiquitin-dependent; however, ubiquitin-independent
pathways may also be related to the degradation of Mcl-1.
To investigate the pathway of Mcl-1 degradation, we also
examined whether Mcl-1 participated in mitogen-activated
protein kinase (MAPK) activation in the metformin-treated
cells. We found that the MAPK inhibitor (PD098059) did
not block Mcl-1 decrease in the metformin-treated cells
(Supplementary Figure S1). These data show that the
decrease of Mcl-1 plays an important role in metformininduced TRAIL sensitization.

Mcl-1 is important for the sensitizing effect of
metformin on TRAIL-induced apoptosis of CRC
cells
We investigated whether the sensitizing effect
of metformin was similar to that produced by TRAIL
when binding to death receptors: activation of the
apoptotic signaling pathway via cleavage of caspases
and inactivation of anti-apoptotic proteins [6]. We found
no change either in the caspase inhibitor protein family
members such as survivin, XIAP, and Bcl-XL, or in the
Bcl-2 family members such as Bax, and Bcl-2. Death
receptors, such as DR4 and DR5, were also unaffected
during metformin treatment in DLD-1 cells, as shown
in Figure 3A. But, in contrary to these proteins, the
level of Mcl-1 decreased in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 3A). This observation was also true in HT29,
Colo205, HCT116, and SNU C2A CRC cell lines
(Figure 3B). Therefore, we studied the role of Mcl-1 by
using recombinant DNA technology. Specifically, we
made stable cell using Mcl-1 cDNA expression vector in
DLD-1 cells. As shown in Figure 3C, DLD-1 potentiated
TRAIL-induced cell death in non-treated cells. However,

Discussion

has been characterized for Mcl-1. We investigated the
expression of Mule by western blot analysis in CRC cells.
Mule was universally expressed in DLD-1 cells. While
ubiquitination of Mcl-1 decreased in CRC cells, Mule
was universally expressed or induced by metformin (data
not shown). Therefore, we investigated the interaction
between Mcl-1 and Mule by immunoprecipitation assays;
immunoprecipitating Mule from metformin-treated cell
lysates of DLD-1 cells and immunoblotting with Mcl-1
antibody. We found enhanced Mcl-1 and Mule interaction
in metformin-treated cells (Figure 5A and 5B). We
confirmed this prolonged interaction between Mule and
Mcl-1 in metformin-treated DLD-1 cells (Figure 5C) by
immunoprecipitating Mule and blotting for Mcl-1. As
a further test, we knocked down Mule expression with
silencing RNA. DLD-1 cells treated with either control
silencing RNA or Mule silencing RNA were incubated
with metformin. The apoptotic index was then analyzed
with the trypan blue assay. We found the apoptotic index
of these cells significantly decreased through inhibition
of Mule levels by silencing RNA treatment (Figure 5D).
Our results indicate that decreased ubiquitination and
degradation of Mcl-1 in CRC cells may result from the
interaction among metformin, Mule, and Mcl-1.

In this study, we first demonstrated that combination
treatment using metformin and TRAIL synergistically
inhibited proliferation of and induced apoptosis in human
CRC cell lines, in addition to reducing the expression of
Mcl-1, p-JAK2, and p-STAT3 (Supplementary Figure S1).
Compared to the individual agents, the metformin and
TRAIL combination significantly inhibited colony
formation in and migration of CRC cells, as well as
significantly decreased Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 (anti-apoptotic
proteins), and increased Bim and Puma (pro-apoptotic
proteins) (Supplementary Figure S1).
Previous studies have demonstrated that Mcl-1
protein has a critical role in the anti-apoptotic system in
CRC cells. Lee et al. [44] showed that tumor specimens
overexpressed Mcl-1 in CRC patients. We found that
metformin increased Mcl-1 degradation via ubiquitin
and induction of cell death by downregulating STAT3
in CRC cells. In addition, higher apoptosis induction
was observed when Mcl-1 was directly knocked down
by silencing RNA for Mcl-1 or indirectly by inhibiting
pERK1/2 (Figure 4B). Our data are consistent with
those of a number of reports, which show that drugs
such as bortezomib, Obatclax (a Bcl-2 inhibitor), and
irinotecan downregulated Mcl-1 to induce apoptosis
in CRC cells [45–47]. Mcl-1 is also an anti-apoptotic
protein known to be degraded via the ubiquitinationproteasome pathway [48]. Glycogen synthase kinase
3 (GSK3β) is a key regulator in tumorigenesis and
mediates phosphorylation of Mcl-1 at Ser159 [49, 50].
As a result, GSK3β can be associated with β-transducin
repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) or F-box/WD repeatcontaining protein 7 (FBXW7) (E3-ubiquitin ligases),
resulting in Mcl-1 degradation [49, 51, 52]. Therefore,
GSK3β plays a critical role in the negative regulation of
Mcl-1 stability. We showed that metformin did not inhibit
GSK3β phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner
(Supplementary Figure S1). In the present study, we
showed that metformin decreased Mcl-1 levels, which
may indicate a major event in increasing the synergism
with TRAIL in dying CRC cells. This event likely occurs
at the post-translational level via reaction of enzymes that
regulate Mcl-1 [53]. The data presented here also indicate
that metformin regulates Mcl-1 expression by stimulating
proteasome-mediated degradation. Furthermore, the
decrease of Mcl-1 occurred without regard to change in
Mcl-1 mRNA transcriptional levels (Figure 4A and 4B).
This finding is important because Mcl-1 levels are
related to initial tumor relapse and shorter survival rate in
patients with CRC [44]. In addition, high levels of cellular
antiapoptotic proteins have been hypothesized to be due to
TRAIL resistance in numerous types of cancer. Notably,

The E3 ligase Mule is required for proteasomal
degradation of Mcl-1 induced by Noxa
Among the E3 ubiquitin ligases related to Mcl-1
ubiquitination, Mule is particularly involved in the
regulation of Mcl-1. Hence, we investigated the interaction
between Mcl-1 and Mule in DLD-1 cells with knockdown
of Noxa. First, we confirmed that metformin induces
increased Bim, Puma, and Noxa expression. As shown
in Figure 6A, there was no change during metformin
treatment in DLD-1 cells, and in Mcl-1 degradationrelated protein members such as Bim, Puma, and Noxa.
Even though the Noxa-Mcl-1 interaction was weak
during base cases, this interaction increased intensely
after the metformin treatment (Figure 6B). We repeated
the immunoprecipitation experiments after knockdown
of Noxa by silencing RNA to determine the function of
Noxa in the Mule/Mcl-1 interaction. In these experiments,
the interactions between Mcl-1’s and Mule’s were
decreased and Mcl-1 polyubiquitination was inhibited
by Noxa silencing (Figure 6C). Next, we analyzed the
presence of higher molecular weight forms of Mcl-1 to
determine if Noxa affects Mcl-1 ubiquitination. We found
that knockdown of Noxa triggered a significant decrease
in Mcl-1 polyubiquitination (Figure 6D). These data
show that Noxa enhances the interaction between Mcl-1
and Mule and as a result, Noxa inhibits degradation by
ubiquitin.

increased Mcl-1 levels have been shown to inhibit TRAILinduced CRC cell death, while a decrease in Mcl-1
increased TRAIL-induced apoptosis in CRC cells [54].
This suggests that overexpression of Mcl-1 could reduce
the effect of apoptotic stimuli such as TRAIL in inducing
cell death, while decreases in Mcl-1 have been associated

with enhanced cytotoxicity of TRAIL [55]. This finding
is consistent with other reports of inhibition of Mcl-1 by
using metformin, further emphasizing the crucial role of
Mcl-1 in metformin-induced apoptosis.
Overexpression of Mcl-1 has been found to be an
indicator of tumor progression and poor outcomes in

numerous human tumors [56–59]. To our knowledge, this
is the first time that metformin has been shown to decrease
Mcl-1 expression in CRC cells. Even though Mcl-1
potentially could be controlled at multiple levels [60, 61],
metformin did not affect the transcriptional level, protein
stability, or degradation of Mcl-1 in CRC cells, indicating
that the metformin-induced decrease of Mcl-1 protein
was not because of transcriptional or post-translational
regulation.
We hypothesized that metformin inhibits de novo
protein synthesis and we studied mechanisms that increase
the stability of Mcl-1 in CRC cells. Notably, we found
that stable binding of Mcl-1 with the E3 ligase, Mule,
may be one of the prominent mechanisms that increase
the stability of Mcl-1 in CRC cells. We believe that
this is the first report of a transient association between
Mule and Mcl-1 in CRC cells. Mule is a novel ubiquitin,

which can specifically interact with Mcl-1 [43, 62]. We
detected a stable prolonged association between Mcl-1 and
Mule in metformin-treated DLD-1 cells, in which Mcl-1
undergoes prominent ubiquitination and degradation.
We found an induced ubiquitination of Mcl-1 as well as
a stable association of Mcl-1 with its specific E3 ligase,
Mule, in CRC cells treated with metformin. Metformin
induced down-regulation of Mcl-1 protein expression
at the post-translational level (Figure 3B). Furthermore,
Mule has been determined to regulate the degradation
of Mcl-1 proteins. Mule has been known to be a multiadaptor protein and an E3 ligase. Gomes-Bouqie et al.
reported that Mule is responsible for degrading Mcl-1
by proteasomes in prostate cancer cells [63]. In this
study, metformin attenuated cell death when Mule was
downregulated by Mule siRNA (Figure 5C). These data
show that metformin increased the stability of Mule in

CRC cells. We also found that metformin counteracts
Mcl-1 by inhibiting Mcl-1 for ubiquitin proteasomeinduced degradation in the CRC cells. Noxa also appears
to play a major regulator of Mcl-1 stability. Noxa has been
presented to negatively regulate Mcl-1 [64], potentially by
increasing the binding of Mule (E3 ligase) and decreasing
the binding of the USP9X (deubiquitinase) to Mcl-1 [63].
This is confirmed by our results that Mcl-1 interacts with
Noxa in control cells and that the knockdown of Noxa
by silencing RNA elevated Mcl-1 protein (Figure 6C). In
addition, metformin quickly replaces Noxa from Mcl-1,
allowing Mule binding and degradation by the ubiquitinproteasome pathway to occur (Figure 6D). In accordance
with a previous report, our data show that Noxa protein
was not altered by metformin [65].
In vitro, the Mcl-1 protein was decreased by either
metformin or TRAIL, and combination of the two drugs
further decreased Mcl-1 protein levels. As Mcl-1 is
strongly increased by proteasome degradation, we studied
the effects of metformin and TRAIL with and without of
MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. Our results showed that
metformin and TRAIL did not change Mcl-1 with MG132,
indicating that metformin and TRAIL induced proteasome
degradation of Mcl-1. These findings imply that metformin
and TRAIL regulate Mcl-1 protein partially through
proteasome degradation.
Additionally, AMPK has been reported to be a major
regulator of metformin in various cancer types. In the
present study, although it is possible that AMPK could be
activated by metformin, which would be inconsistent with
previous studies, the anti-proliferation effect of metformin
does not require AMPK activation. When AMPKα was
knocked down by silencing RNA, the survival rates of the
cells treated with metformin, TRAIL, or the combination
were not statistically significantly different (data not
shown). In addition, the decrease of Mcl-1 by metformin
was observed even in the absence of AMPKα, showing
that downregulation of Mcl-1 by metformin is independent
of AMPK activation.
STAT3 is a main modulator in inflammationmediated tumorigenesis, including CRC, by promoting
tumor cell proliferation and survival. We found that
metformin significantly suppressed the phosphorylation
of STAT3 in CRC cells. This observation is consistent
with the previous findings that metformin inhibited the
transcriptional activation of STAT3 in various cancer cell
lines [66–68]. STAT3 is also known to modulate Mcl-1
translation, which supports STAT3-dependent cell growth
and proliferation. In our study, however, decreasing
STAT3 levels produced no change in the cells’ sensitivity
cell to metformin. Moreover, Mcl-1 protein did not change
in STAT3-silenced cells. In our study, we also detected
a down-regulation of STAT3 in metformin-treated cells
(data not shown). Our previous studies have reported that
inhibition of STAT3 by S31-201 (STAT3 inhibitor) or
silencing RNA led to a significant decrease in the level
of Mcl-1 and enhanced HSP90 inhibitor (NVP-AUY922)www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

induced apoptosis in CRC cells [54]. Therefore, inhibition
of STAT3 may be an effective medical treatment to
sensitize cancer cell to apoptotic stimuli such as radiation
or anticancer drugs. Furthermore, a JAK/STAT3-signaled
decrease of Mcl-1 protein is considered to be a crucial
factor responsible for metformin-induced sensitization to
TRAIL in CRC cells. Thus, we propose that metformin
may cause a decrease of Mcl-1 through the JAK/STAT3
signal of its regulation. Here, we determined that
metformin inhibited the phosphorylation of JAK2 and
STAT3, but could not effectively decrease the Mcl-1
level (Supplementary Figure S1). However, this downregulation of STAT3 had no effect on Mcl-1 expression or
TRAIL sensitization in metformin-treated cells (data not
shown). Hence, these data show that the decrease of Mcl-1
by metformin is independent of the down-regulation of
JAK/STAT3 expression in CRC cells.
Last, it has been found in breast cancer cells that
ERK1/2 can phosphorylate and stabilize Mcl-1 [69].
We found ERK1/2 and its active form pERK1/2 to be
upregulated in all the CRC cells examined; their levels
were downregulated after metformin treatment, pointing
to increased stability of these proteins (Supplementary
Figure S1). Inactivating pERK1/2 with the MEK inhibitor,
U0126, promoted decline of Mcl-1 levels in CRC cells
(data not shown).
In conclusion, our findings show that the novel
mechanism of cell death induced by metformin involves
TRAIL sensitization and degradation of Mcl-1, important
for an understanding of its role in the pathophysiology,
diagnosis, and ways to treat cancer. Finally, these data
are the first to indicate that metformin suppresses cell
proliferation and enhances apoptosis when used in
combination with TRAIL in human CRC cells, possibly
through Noxa-mediated increase in Mcl-1 degradation via
the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.
