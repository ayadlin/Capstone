Abstract
Because the emergence of drug resistance is a major limitation of current
treatments for multiple myeloma (MM), it is necessary to continuously develop novel
anticancer strategies. Here, using an inactivated Sendai virus (Hemagglutinating
Virus of Japan; HVJ) envelope (HVJ-E), we discovered that increase of cytoplasmic
Ca2+ by virus-cell fusion significantly induced apoptosis against human MM cells but
not peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy donors. Interaction of F protein
of HVJ-E with MM cells increased intracellular Ca2+ level of MMs by the induction of
Ca2+ efflux from endoplasmic reticulum but not influx from extracellular region. The
elevation of the Ca2+ cytoplasmic level induced SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation and
translocation into the nucleus, and SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD4 complex suppressed
c-Myc transcription. Meanwhile, HVJ-E decreases S62 phosphorylation of c-Myc
and promotes c-Myc protein degradation. Thus, HVJ-E-induced cell death of MM
resulted from suppression of c-Myc by both destabilization of c-Myc protein and
downregulation of c-Myc transcription. This study indicates that HVJ-E will be a
promising tool for MM therapy.

Introduction

abnormalities, can contribute to drug resistance [3, 8, 9].
Moreover the aberrant expression of oncogenes, such as
c-MAF, c-Myc, and cyclin D has been found to contribute
to drug resistance in MM [10–12]. Therefore, there is
a need to develop new therapeutic strategies for the
treatment of MM.
Myc pathway activation increases with the disease
stage in MM, and a conditional MYC transgene murine
model develops a plasma cell malignancy during the
late stages of B cell differentiation that shares clinically
relevant features of MM [13]. This result supports the
central role of c-Myc activity in the pathogenesis of MM.
In addition, c-Myc overexpression occurs via different
mechanisms, including gene amplification, translocation
and mutation. c-Myc chromosomal rearrangements were
found in 15% of newly diagnosed MM patients [14],
nearly 50% of advanced MM patients [15, 16], 55% of
human MM cell lines [14], and such rearrangements
have also been implicated in drug resistance in MM
[11]. Furthermore, the inhibition of c-Myc activity by a
short-hairpin RNA targeting c-Myc has been shown to

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a kind of hematologic
B cell malignancy that is featured by the accumulation
of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Current
treatments, including dexamethasone, chemotherapy,
stem cell transplantation, proteasome inhibitors and
immunomodulatory drugs, have made substantial
progress toward increasing longevity in MM patients
[1, 2]. However, one major limitation of the existing
drugs is the eventual emergence of drug resistance for
nearly all patients, regardless of the treatment regimen
or the initial response to treatment [3]. It is well known
that bone marrow microenvironment changes, such as cell
adhesion and cytokine-related induction of the JAK/STAT
and PI3K/AKT pathways, are responsible for resistance
to conventional and novel therapies [4, 5]. Because MM
is characterized by a high level of genomic instability and
complex cytogenetic aberrations [6, 7], many of these
alterations, which include chromosomal translocation,
methylation, gene mutation, and microRNA (miRNA)

be lethal to a number of human myeloma cell lines [17].
In addition, a small molecule inhibitor of BRD4 that
suppresses c-Myc transcription shows therapeutic effects
against MM in vitro and in vivo, and the small molecule
inhibitor 10058-F4a, that specifically inhibits c-Myc-Max
heterodimerization, prevents the transactivation of c-Myc,
induces cell death in human myeloma cell lines and
primary cells of myeloma patients [18, 19]. Thus, c-Myc
is likely a promising therapeutic target for MM treatment.
Virotherapy has been shown to have anticancer
effects on cancer cells but not normal cells in solid and
hematological malignancies. MM represents an attractive
target for virotherapy in comparison to many solid
tumors because viruses can easily access the tumor cells
in the bone marrow and bloodstream. Currently, four
RNA viruses (measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus,
reovirus and coxsackievirus A21) and two DNA viruses
(adenovirus and vaccinia virus) have shown oncolytic
potential against MM [20]. These viruses kill cancer cells
via selective viral replication in cancer cells but lose their
oncolytic activity following inactivation [21, 22]. To date,
inactive viral particles have not been included in oncolytic
virotherapy for multiple myeloma.
The Sendai virus (Hemagglutinating Virus of Japan;
HVJ) belongs to the paramyxovirus family and has six
viral proteins encoded by a negative-sense single-strand
RNA genome: nucleocapsid (N); phosphoprotein (P);
large (L) matrix (M); fusion (F); and hemagglutininneuraminidase (HN). When the Sendai viral genome was
cleaved into small pieces by UV irradiation, the viral
proteins remained functional [23]. We have documented
that the inactivated Sendai virus envelope (HVJ-E) has
multiple anti-tumor effects, including the activation
of anti-tumor immunity and induction of cancer cellselective apoptosis [24–26]. Moreover, we demonstrated
that HVJ-E RNA fragment-dependent activation of
the cytoplasmic RNA receptor retinoic acid-inducible
gene-I (RIG-I) and mitochondrial antiviral signaling
protein (MAVS) activates the upregulation of TRAIL and
Noxa, which enables HVJ-E-mediated cancer-selective
apoptosis [26]. The therapeutic potential of HVJ-E has
been demonstrated in solid tumors [27–30], but there are
no reports concerning whether this virus can be used for
the treatment of hematopoietic malignances.
In the present study, we showed that HVJ-E
induced cancer-selective apoptosis in multiple myeloma
cells with c-Myc addiction. In addition to decrease
the phosphorylation of c-Myc at S62 and promote
c-Myc protein degradation, HVJ-E induced fusionmediated elevation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ results in c-Myc
transcriptional inhibition. Furthermore, we addressed
the mechanisms behind cytoplasmic Ca2+ increasing
induced suppression of c-Myc transcription, activation of
SMADs family involved in c-Myc downregulation. These
results also provide the possibility that HVJ-E will be a
therapeutic tool for MMs.

HVJ-E induces apoptosis in human multiple
myeloma cell lines but not in PBMCs from
healthy donors
To investigate whether HVJ-E exhibits an anticancer effect against MM, human myeloma cell lines
(NCI-H929, MM1S, RPMI-8226 and U266) and normal
human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
from healthy donors were treated with HVJ-E for 72
hours, and cell viability was measured using the MTS
assay (Supplementary Figure 1A–1E). The cell viability
of NCI-H929, MM1S, and RPMI-8226, but not U266
and PBMCs, was significantly decreased with HVJ-E in a
dose-dependent manner. We showed that HVJ-E exhibited
cytotoxicity against various MM cells but not healthy
PBMCs. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs)
and human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were also
treated with HVJ-E, and the proliferation of HUVECs and
HAECs was not inhibited (Supplementary Figure 1F–1G),
which is consistent with our previous report [31].
Next, to investigate whether apoptosis is the
mechanism underlying HVJ-E-mediated cell death in
MM, we assayed certain markers of apoptosis in HVJE-treated MMs and PBMCs. Large populations of HVJE-treated NCI-H929 and MM1S cells but not U266
cells and PBMCs were Annexin-V-positive (Figure 1A
and 1B). Further analysis of leukocyte subsets in PBMCs
from healthy donors showed that the Annexin-V-positive
apoptotic cells did not change in the CD3+ T cell, CD19+
B cell and CD14+ monocyte populations after HVJ-E
treatment (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B). Although
CD15+ neutrophils undergo spontaneous apoptosis after 48
hours of incubation in vitro, as reported in previous studies
[32], no significant difference in CD15+Annexin-V+ cells
was observed in the presence and absence of 48 hours
of HVJ-E treatment in neutrophils (Supplementary
Figure 2C and 2D). We also examined apoptotic cells
among HUVECs and HAECs in the presence and absence
of wild-type (WT) and HN-depleted HVJ-E. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 2E and 2F, the ratio of AnnexinV-labeled apoptotic cells was not changed by treatment
with either WT-HVJ-E or HN-depleted HVJ-E. These
results suggest that HVJ-E elicits no harmful effect on
healthy leukocytes and endothelial cells after systemic
administration. Moreover, the cleavage of caspase-8,
caspase-3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was
detected in HVJ-E-treated NCI-H929 and MM1S cells but
not U266 cells by western blotting analysis (Figure 1C).
A pan-caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) prevented HVJE-mediated activation of caspase-3 (Figure 1D) and cell
death (Figure 1E), indicating that HVJ-E induced caspasedependent apoptosis in MM.
Furthermore, we investigated various proteins
related to apoptosis and the expression levels of

antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members B-cell lymphomaextra-large (Bcl-xL) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)
remained unchanged in responses to HVJ-E treatment in
NCI-H929 and MM1S cells (Supplementary Figure 3A).
However, we demonstrated that HVJ-E treatment
enhanced the expression of the proapoptotic protein Bcl2-like protein 11 (Bim), which consists of three major
isoforms as a result of alternative splicing (BimEL,
BimL and BimS), but not BH3 interacting-domain death
agonist (Bid), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad),

Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) or p53-upregulated
modulator of apoptosis (Puma) in NCI-H929 cells in
a time-dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 3B).
By immunoblotting analysis, we also found that HVJ-E
induced Bim upregulation in RPMI-8226 and MM1S
cell lines (Supplementary Figure 3C). Moreover, HVJ-Emediated cell death was attenuated by Bim knockdown
(Supplementary Figure 3D), suggesting that the Bim
upregulation stimulated HVJ-E-induced apoptosis in
myeloma cells.

In vivo MM tumor suppression by HVJ-E
treatment

Increase of cytosolic calcium by HVJ-E
treatment induced apoptosis by suppressing
c-Myc expression in MM

To investigate the efficacy of HVJ-E against MM
in vivo, we incubated an MM1S xenograft in NOG mice.
As shown in Figure 2A, HVJ-E treatment substantially
lowered the tumor burden in comparison to the PBS group.
Moreover, we designed an NCI-H929 xenograft model in
NOG mice. NCI-H929 is a human MM cell line derived
from a right pleural effusion of a 62-year-old patient who
was treated for relapse after treatment with vincristine,
melphalan, cytoxan and prednisone [33]. As shown in
Figure 2B, HVJ-E treatment significantly suppressed
tumor growth in the NCI-H929 xenograft in comparison
to PBS treatment. Taken together, these results further
support the potential of HVJ-E for the treatment of MM.

In this study, we demonstrated that in contrast
to MM1S and NCI-H929 cells, U266 cells showed a
lack of response to HVJ-E (Figure 1A, Supplementary
Figure 1D). We considered that this differential
susceptibility to HVJ-E might result from different
expression of genes targeted by HVJ-E, which determine
cell fate. Previous studies demonstrated that aberrant
c-Myc expression is associated with myeloma cell
survival and proliferation [2, 5]. Therefore, we focused
on the regulation of c-Myc expression in HVJ-E-treated
MM cells. As shown in Figure 4A, c-Myc expression
was detected in NCI-H929, MM1S and RPMI-8226
cells, and c-Myc expression was significantly suppressed
by HVJ-E treatment. However, c-Myc expression was
barely detected in U266 cells, as reported in a previous
study [8]. c-Myc expression in NCI-H929 cells was
suppressed by HVJ-E in a dose-dependent manner
(Figure 4B). To further understand the correlation
between c-Myc expression and apoptosis, we knocked
down c-Myc expression in NCI-H929 and MM1S cells.
c-Myc knockdown led to a decrease in cell viability
(Figure 4C) and the cleavage of the apoptosis marker
caspase-3 (Supplementary Figure 6). Moreover, c-Myc
overexpression in MM1S cells inhibited HVJ-E-mediated
c-Myc downregulation and cell death (Figure 4D, 4E).
Taken together, these results suggest that HVJ-E-induced
c-Myc downregulation causes apoptosis in MM cells,
and the endogenous c-Myc expression level determines
the susceptibility of MM cell lines to HVJ-E.
To determine whether the increase in cytosolic
Ca2+ was required for c-Myc downregulation, c-Myc
expression was examined in the presence of BAPTAAM-treated MM cells. NCI-H929 and MM1S cells
were treated with 1,000 MOI HVJ-E in the presence
or absence of BAPTA-AM, and c-Myc expression was
examined by immunoblotting (Figure 4F). HVJ-E alone
remarkably decreased c-Myc expression, while BAPTAAM prevented HVJ-E-induced c-Myc downregulation.
These data suggest that the HVJ-E mediated increase in
Ca2+ in the cytoplasm is an upstream signaling element in
the downregulation of c-Myc, which determines HVJ-Emediated cytotoxicity in MM cells.
We next examined the key factor underlying the
induction of HVJ-E-mediated apoptosis via an increase in
cytosolic Ca2+. We showed that a Ca2+ ionophore (A23817)
significantly decreased the viability of NCI-H929 and
MM1S cells compared to U266 cells and PBMCs
(Figure 5A). Meanwhile, in addition, A23817 induced
c-Myc downregulation in NCI-H929 and MM1S in a timedependent manner (Figure 5B). These results confirmed
that an increase in cytosolic free Ca2+ induced cell death in
MMs independently of HVJ-E treatment.

Increases in cytosolic free calcium contribute to
HVJ-E-mediated cytotoxicity in MM cells
Previous studies have shown that HVJ-E-mediated
cell death is induced by the recognition of HVJ-E RNA
genome fragments with RNA receptor retinoic-acid
inducible gene-I (RIG-I) or an elevation of the cytosolic
Ca2+ concentration [26, 34]. We found that HVJ-E failed
to induce RIG-I expression in MM cells (NCI-H929,
U266 and MM1S; Supplementary Figure 4A). Moreover,
transfection of HVJ-E RNA genome fragments did not
inhibit the viability of NCI-H929 cells (Supplementary
Figure 4B). These results suggest that RIG-I signaling
is not involved in HVJ-E-induced apoptosis in MM
cells. Therefore, we next focused on the cytosolic Ca2+
concentration of HVJ-E-treated MM cells. NCI-H929
and MM1S cells were exposed to HVJ-E for 0.5, 1 and
3 hours, and cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels were measured using
Fluo-4-AM. Cytoplasmic Ca2+ peaked after 0.5 hours of
HVJ-E treatment (Figure 3A, Supplementary Figure 5A).
In addition, NCI-H929 and MM1S cells were treated with
HVJ-E and a Ca2+ chelator (BAPTA-AM) to prevent the
effects of Ca2+ elevation, and BAPTA-AM almost entirely
abrogated HVJ-E-induced cytotoxicity in NCI-H929 cells
(Figure 3B, Supplementary Figure 5B).
Next, we investigated the source of the increase
in free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of HVJ-E-treated MMs.
Although the NCI-H929 cells were cultured in Ca2+free medium to block Ca2+ influx from the extracellular
space, HVJ-E exhibited cell toxicity in common with the
culture in normal medium (Figure 3C). However, HVJE-mediated cell death was inhibited in a dose-dependent
manner by 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), which
is an inhibitor of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor
(IP3R)/Ca2+ channel in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),
(Figure 3D, Supplementary Figure 5C). These results
suggested that HVJ-E elevated cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels by
efflux from the ER but not influx from the extracellular
space to induce apoptosis in MM cells.

c-Myc downregulation by calcium signal results
from both enhanced degradation of c-Myc
protein and suppression of c-Myc transcription

S62 phosphorylation decreased at an earlier time point
compared with the reduction of c-Myc whole protein
and c-Myc T58 phosphorylation in NCI-H929 cells
(Figure 6A).
Next, we tested whether HVJ-E would accelerate
c-Myc degradation. We cotreated NCI-H929 cells with
HVJ-E and cycloheximide (CHX) to inhibit de novo
protein synthesis, and c-Myc protein levels were measured
by immunoblot analysis over 2 hours. As shown in
Figure 6B and 6C, HVJ-E treatment significantly increased
c-Myc protein degradation. These results indicated that
HVJ-E downregulated c-Myc expression by decreasing
the S62 phosphorylation of c-Myc protein and accelerating
the rate of c-Myc protein degradation.
The HVJ-E-mediated acceleration of c-Myc
degradation was significant but slight because the levels

c-Myc expression can be controlled by posttranslational and transcriptional regulation [35, 36]. A
post-translational pathway that affects c-Myc protein
stability is dependent on the phosphorylation of two
conserved amino acids: Serine 62 (S62) and Threonine
58 (T58). The elevation of S62 and loss of T58
phosphorylation of c-Myc protein increases Myc protein
stability in several solid cancers [37–39]. The decrease
in S62 phosphorylation could be a potential approach
for reducing the levels of c-Myc protein in cancers.
Here, we observed that during the HVJ-E-induced timedependent downregulation of c-Myc protein, c-Myc

of remaining c-Myc protein became nearly equivalent in
the presence or absence of HVJ-E treatment after 90 min
of CHX treatment (Figure 6B and 6C). Therefore, we
hypothesized that other factors might also participate
in the HVJ-E-mediated c-Myc downregulation. Next,
we focused on c-Myc transcriptional regulation and
examined endogenous c-Myc mRNA levels by real-time
PCR in HVJ-E-treated NCI-H929 cells. As shown in
Figure 6D, HVJ-E induced a transient increase in c-Myc
mRNA within one hour and a decrease to below the
baseline level after four hours of treatment. Moreover,
BAPTA-AM inhibited the HVJ-E-induced suppression
of c-Myc transcription in NCI-H929 and MM1S cells
(Figure 6E). Taken together, these results suggest that the
HVJ-E-induced increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ mediated

the downregulation of c-Myc expression mainly by
suppressing c-Myc transcription.

Calcium-mediated suppression of c-Myc
transcription depends on SMADs activation
Finally, we investigated the mechanism by which
c-Myc transcription was inhibited by the cytoplasmic
Ca2+ increase in MMs. A previous study demonstrated
that the cytosolic increase in Ca2+ induces Smad1
phosphorylation to promote Smad1 nuclear translocation
[40]. In addition, either SMAD1 or SMAD1/5/8 regulates
c-Myc transcription by binding to SMAD4 to form a
Smad complex [41–43]. As shown in Figure 7A, the
transient knockdown of Smad4 in NCI-H929 cells by

siRNA inhibited the HVJ-E-induced suppression of
c-Myc transcription. HVJ-E induced the phosphorylation
of Smad1/5/8 as well as the repression of c-Myc in
NCI-H929 and MM1S cells (Figure 7B). Moreover, in
HVJ-E-treated NCI-H929 cells, the immunoblotting
results clearly revealed a significant increase in
phosphorylated SMAD1/5/8 in the nuclear fraction

following HVJ-E stimulation, and BAPTA-AM abolished
the HVJ-E-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear
translocation of SMAD1/5/8 (Figure 7C, Supplementary
Figure 7). Taken together, Figure 7 suggests that the
increase in cytosolic Ca2+ mediating Smad activation is
involved in the downregulation of HVJ-E-induced c-Myc
transcription in MM.

Discussion

regulation of cancer cell proliferation and highly controls
malignant state in various cancer cells [44, 45]. In previous
reports, even transient inactivation of c-Myc leads to
tumor collapse in mice models [46–48]. Therefore, there
is a possibility that HVJ-E is able to induce cell death
in malignant cancer cells with c-Myc addiction via the
increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+ without affecting normal
cells lacking c-Myc addiction. Moreover, as shown in this
report, besides inhibiting c-Myc transcription, developing
methods that accelerate the rate of c-Myc destruction by
destabilizing c-Myc protein may ultimately prove effective
in tumor settings [49, 50].
It is well known that Ca2+ level modification plays
important roles in regulating cell death (for example,
apoptosis [51, 52] and autophagy [53]). However, in

In the present study, we demonstrated that HVJ-E
effectively induced apoptosis in various MM cells by
downregulating c-Myc via an elevation of cytoplasmic
Ca2+ levels. Calcium-induced c-Myc downregulation
resulted from both suppression of c-Myc transcription
via activation of SMAD1/5/8 and acceleration of c-Myc
protein degradation. MM cells (NCI-H929, MM1S, and
RPMI8226) which were highly expressing c-Myc were
preferentially killed by increase of calcium signal via
fusion with HVJ-E, but U266 MM cell line and PBMCs
were not killed. Therefore, MM cells with c-Myc addiction
can be killed by HVJ-E via elevation of cytosolic calcium.
c-Myc is an important transcription factor for the

this study, we demonstrated that HVJ-E induced Ca2+dependent apoptosis, but autophagy was not involved in
HVJ-E-induced cell death (unpublished data). Numerous
Ca2+-dependent downstream effectors can efficiently
transduce extracellular signals into apoptosis [52, 54].
However, protein kinase C (PKC) [55], calpains activation
and ER stress [54] were not the downstream events
involved in Ca2+ level modification-induced apoptosis
by HVJ-E (unpublished data). Several papers suggested
the relationship between the increase in cytosolic Ca2+
and decrease in c-Myc transcription. The Ca2+ ionophore
A23817 downregulates c-Myc expression in human
promyelocytic leukemia and T lymphoblastic leukemia
cells (HL-60, MOLT-4) by inhibiting RNA elongation
[56, 57]. However, those reports showed no evidence that
the downregulation of c-Myc is responsible for A23817induced cell death by increasing cytosolic Ca2+ levels. The
crosslinking of IgM in murine B-lymphoma cells induces
G1 arrest and apoptosis by p27Kip1 accumulation, which
results from either c-Myc downregulation or increase of
cytosolic calcium [58]. This report indicates that c-Myc
downregulation and cytosolic calcium increase are
independently involved in apoptosis of lymphoma cells.
No relationship between two pathways is clearly shown.
Thus, till now, there have been no reports putting links
among cytosolic Ca2+ increase, c-Myc downregulation and
apoptosis.
In the present study, we found that HVJ-Einduced cell death was dependent on the downregulation
of c-Myc (Figure 4E) and that the intracellular Ca2+
chelator BAPTA-AM prevented the HVJ-E-induced
c-Myc downregulation (Figure 4F and Figure 6E) and
cell death of MM cells (Figure 3B). Taken together, our
results confirm that the accumulation of cytosolic Ca2+
upstream of c-Myc downregulation leads to apoptosis
in HVJ-E-treated MMs. In this study, we also found
that HVJ-E treatment increased the expression of the
pro-apoptotic protein Bim in MM cells (Supplementary
Figure 3B, 3C). The relationship between c-Myc and
Bim regulation was well documented in MM cells in a
previous study [59]. Namely, shRNA-mediated c-Myc
suppression subsequently increases Bim expression in
myeloma cells, which indicates that the silencing of
c-Myc induces myeloma cell apoptosis [59]. In our study,
HVJ-E mediated both c-Myc downregulation and Bim
upregulation, and the siRNA-mediated downregulation
of Bim inhibited the cytotoxicity of HVJ-E in MM cells
(Supplementary Figure 3D). These results suggest that
HVJ-E-induced c-Myc downregulation likely results in
Bim upregulation, which leads to apoptosis in MM cells.
HN glycoprotein enables HVJ-E particles to adhere
to the host cell surface [60]. A previous study indicated
that HVJ-E-mediated cytotoxicity is dependent on the
expression of GD1a and SPG, which are HN receptors
[61], on target cells. In the present study, we showed
that HVJ-E exhibited cytotoxic activity against MM
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cells, although, MM cells had no conventional receptors
for acidic gangliosides recognized by HN glycoprotein
of HVJ (Supplementary Figure 8A); however, HVJ-E
could still bind to MM cells (Supplementary Figure 8B).
Moreover, HN-depleted HVJ-E could adhere to
the cell surface of NCI-H929 cells (Supplementary
Figure 9A) and induce apoptosis via membrane fusion
(Supplementary Figure 9B and 9C). For these reasons, we
suggest that MMs may express an unknown receptor for
F binding to induce membrane fusion. MM is a systemic
cancer, and systemic treatment is required for MM
therapy. Because HN is responsible for not only HVJ-E
particle-adhesion but also hemagglutination, systemic
administration of HVJ-E is not practical. Although HN
depletion of HVJ-E decreases both hemagglutinating
activity and cell adhesion ability [62], HN-depleted
HVJ-E displays added cancer cell affinity and utility for
cancer therapy [63]. Here, we showed that MMs had an
affinity for HN-depleted HVJ-E. Therefore, the systemic
administration of HN-depleted HVJ-E will be a promising
tool for MM therapy.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human MM cell lines (NCI-H929, MM1S, U266,
and RPMI-8226) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC; VA, USA). MM1S, U266, and
RPMI-8226 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
(Nacalai Tesque, Inc., Kyoto, Japan) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 µg/
ml of streptomycin (Nacalai Tesque). NCI-929 cells were
cultured in streptomycin and 2­mercaptoethanol (Nacalai
Tesque) at a final concentration of 0.05 mM. PBMCs were
obtained from healthy donors after obtaining informed
consent. Five milliliters of whole blood were collected
from three healthy donors, and PBMCs were isolated
from the blood by cell density centrifugation over a
Ficoll-Paque density gradient. PBMCs were washed
three times with sterile PBS (Nacalai Tesque). PBMCs
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) and RPMI 1640 mixed 1:1 and supplemented
with 100 U/ml of penicillin, 100 μg/ml of streptomycin,
5% heat-inactivated AB human serum (Sigma-Aldrich,
Inc., Tokyo, Japan), 10 mM HEPES, and 60 μg/ml of
arginine-HCl.

Preparation of HVJ-E
HVJ (VR-105 parainfluenza 1 Sendai/52, Z strain
from the ATCC) was amplified in the chorioallantoic fluid
of 14-day-old chick eggs, purified by centrifugation and
inactivated by UV irradiation (99 millijoules/cm²). The
inactivated virus lost the ability to replicate and synthesize
viral proteins but retained its membrane fusion activity.

to the manufacturer’s instructions. For c-Myc and Smad4
transient silencing, NCI-H929 and MM1S cells were
transfected with SMARTpool Accell human c-Myc siRNA
(E-003282-00-0005; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., UT,
USA) or Smad4 siRNA (E-003902-00-0005; Thermo
Fisher Scientific), and Accell Green Non-targeting siRNA
(D-001950-01-20; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as
a control. We used 100 pmol of siRNA/2.5 × 105 cells.
For c-Myc overexpression, plasmid vectors containing
a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter with or without
(control) human c-Myc cDNA were purchased from
Thermo Fisher Scientific. One microgram of plasmid per
2.5 × 105 cells was used.

To inhibit caspase activity, 100 μmol/L of the pancaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Medical and Biological
Laboratories, Inc., Nagoya, Japan) was added to the
cells one hour prior to HVJ-E treatment. Calcium-free
conditions were prepared using calcium-free RPMI
1640 medium (US Biological, Inc., MO, USA), and in
the cytoplasmic Ca2+ inhibition experiments, 5 μmol/L
BAPTA-AM or 50 μmol/L 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate
(2-APB) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells 1 hour
before exposure to HVJ-E. To increase cytoplasmic Ca2+,
A23817 was used which was purchased from SigmaAldrich (Tokyo, Japan).

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR

Cytotoxicity assays

RNA was extracted from cultured cells using the
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), and 500 ng
of total RNA were converted into cDNA using the High
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Tokyo, Japan). Human c-Myc and β-actin
were amplified using SYBR Premix Ex Taq (Takara Bio,
Shiga, Japan). All procedures were performed according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following primers
were used:
Human β-actin-forward, 5′-GAGCTACGAGCTG
CCTGACG-3′, and
Human β-actin-reverse, 5′-GTAGTTTCGTGGAT
GCCACAG-3′; and
Human c-Myc forward, 5′-GACCAG- CTGGAGAT
GGTGAC-3′, and
Human c-Myc reverse, 5′-GGTCGCAGATGAAA
CTCTGG-3′.

Cell viability was determined using the Cell Titer 96
Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay kit (Promega,
Inc., WI, USA). Briefly, after treatment with the compounds
at the indicated concentrations for the indicated durations,
100 μl of Cell Titer 96 Aqueous One Solution reagent was
added to each well, and the plates were incubated at 37°C in
5% carbon dioxide for 2 hours. After transferring 100 μl of
incubation medium from each well into a new 96-well plate,
the absorbance at 490 nm was measured.

Assessment of apoptosis
Apoptosis was evaluated using a PE Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD Biosciences, Inc., CA,
USA). Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of
1× binding buffer, to which was added 5 μl of Annexin V
and 5 μl of propidium iodide. The cells were incubated in
the dark for 15 minutes. For the flow cytometry analysis,
the percentages of the positive cells in the upper right
(Annexin V+/PI+: late apoptotic cells) and lower right
quadrants (Annexin V+/PI−: early apoptotic cells) were
summed to obtain the total number of apoptotic cells.
