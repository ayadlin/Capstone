ABSTRACT
ATP-binding cassette subfamily G member 2 (ABCG2) is a member of the ABC
transporter superfamily proteins, which has been implicated in the development of
multidrug resistance (MDR) in cancer, apart from its physiological role to remove
toxic substances out of the cells. The diverse range of substrates of ABCG2 includes
many antineoplastic agents such as topotecan, doxorubicin and mitoxantrone. ABCG2
expression has been reported to be significantly increased in some solid tumors and
hematologic malignancies, correlated to poor clinical outcomes. In addition, ABCG2
expression is a distinguishing feature of cancer stem cells, whereby this membrane
transporter facilitates resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs. To enhance the
chemosensitivity of cancer cells, attention has been focused on MDR modulators.
In this study, we investigated the effect of a tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium channel
blocker, A-803467 on ABCG2-overexpressing drug selected and transfected cell lines.
We found that at non-toxic concentrations, A-803467 could significantly increase
the cellular sensitivity to ABCG2 substrates in drug-resistant cells overexpressing
either wild-type or mutant ABCG2. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that A-803467
(7.5 μM) significantly increased the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-mitoxantrone
by inhibiting the transport activity of ABCG2, without altering its expression levels. In
addition, A-803467 stimulated the ATPase activity in membranes overexpressed with
ABCG2. In a murine model system, combination treatment of A-803467 (35 mg/kg)
and topotecan (3 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the tumor growth in mice xenografted
with ABCG2-overexpressing cancer cells. Our findings indicate that a combination of
A-803467 and ABCG2 substrates may potentially be a novel therapeutic treatment in
ABCG2-positive drug resistant cancers.

phenotype when the cells show cross-resistance to
drugs that are structurally and functionally unrelated to
the original drug which the cells are resistant [2]. Once
MDR is acquired, the efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs
decreases. MDR is the most significant hindrance to
successful chemotherapy, and is a main cause of cancer

INTRODUCTION
Multidrug resistance (MDR) is defined as the
resistance of cancer cells to antineoplastic agents that
have distinct structures and mechanisms of action [1].
Particularly, cancer cells are said to have an MDR

metastasis and relapse [3]. Chemotherapy resistance can
be primary, which is initially determined by a refractory
response to the pharmacotherapy, or secondary/acquired,
which is developed during treatment progression [3].
The potential mechanisms of MDR include
pharmacokinetic alterations, tumor micro-environmental
changes, or cancer cell-specific factors that occur at
different levels due to cellular alterations, which include
increased drug efflux or decreased drug uptake, drug
inactivation, drug target modification or apoptosis evasion
[4]. The key effectors of drug resistance are multidrug
transporters which can be elevated or hyper-activated
during the genesis of drug resistant cancers. The ATPbinding cassette (ABC) multidrug transporters such as
ABCB1 (MDR1/P-glycoprotein), ABCC1 (MRP1) and
ABCG2 (BCRP/MXR) are considered to be accountable
for the majority of drug efflux in human cancers [5].
The ABCG2 transporter is a 72-kDa half transporter,
which was identified from a doxorubicin-selected MCF-7
human breast cancer cell line [6], human placenta [7],
and a colon cancer cell line (S1-M1–80) [8]. ABCG2 is
specifically localized at the apical surface of enterocytes,
the luminal surface of liver canaliculi, the luminal surface
of the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidneys, the
blood–brain barrier (BBB), blood–testis barrier (BTB),
blood–placental and blood–retinal barriers. Because of its
localization on the secretory surface of the major organs
involved in drug transport, ABCG2 alters the ADME
(absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination)
of its substrate drugs. ABCG2 can transport large,
hydrophobic, positively and negatively charged molecules,
including cytotoxic compounds such as mitoxantrone
(MX), topotecan, flavopiridol and methotrexate [9].
Although the contribution of ABCG2 in clinical MDR
has not been completely investigated, some studies have
described the association between ABCG2 expression
and poor chemotherapeutic response. Increased ABCG2
gene expression has also been related to poor response
to chemotherapy in childhood acute myeloid leukemia
(AML) and relapsed AML [10, 11]. ABCG2 expression
has also been reported in leukemia, especially in pediatric
AML [12]. In addition, increased ABCG2 mRNA has been
reported in irinotecan treated hepatic metastases compared
to irinotecan-naive metastases [13]. ABCG2 expression has
been reported in various solid tumors, such as those present
in the digestive tract, endometrium and melanoma [14].
Recently, ABCG2 has been recognized as a
molecular marker for the side population (SP) cells, these
are putative cancer stem cell CSC population. SP cells are
identified using dual wavelength flow cytometry combined
with Hoechst 33342 dye efflux [15]. For human NonSmall Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, excluding
0.03 - 6.1% of the tumor cells which were SP cells [16],
the presence of a Hoechst dye 33342 showed elevated
expression of ABCG2, an increased tumorigenicity in

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mice resistant to various chemotherapeutic agents [17].
Moreover, Yoh et al. found that positive immunostaining
for ABCG2 appears to be a predictor of shorter survival in
patients with advanced NSCLC [18]. Until now, several
ABCG2 inhibitors with diverse chemical structures have
been found or developed, but none of them have been
tested clinically due to concerns of toxicity, safety or the
pharmacokinetic uncertainty of the compounds [19].
A-803467 is a potent and selective Nav1.8
sodium channel blocker, which has shown significant
anti-nociception in animal models of neuropathic and
inflammatory pain [20]. Previously, ion channel inhibitors
such as verapamil and quinidine have shown to reverse
ABC transporter mediated MDR [21]. We, and others,
have further reported several natural drugs, marine drugs,
semi-synthetic and synthetic compounds which could
reverse ABCG2-mediated MDR [22–25]. Therefore, here
we determine A-803467 as a therapeutic compound to
enhance the chemosensitivity of conventional anticancer
drugs through interaction with the ABCG2 transporter.

RESULTS
A-803467 significantly increases the cytotoxicity
of anticancer drugs which are substrates of
ABCG2, but not of ABCB1 and ABCC10
Cytotoxicity of A-803467 treatment alone on
ABCG2-overexpressing cell lines was investigated
and found to be nontoxic with IC50 values greater than
10 μM (Supplementary Figure S1). Accordingly, reversal
concentrations of 2.5 and 7.5 μM, at which no significant
cytotoxicity was detected for A-803467 alone, were
chosen for further experiments. HEK293 cells transfected
with wild-type (HEK293/R482) and mutant (HEK293/
R482G and HEK293/R482T) ABCG2 (Supplementary
Figure  S2) showed significant resistance to MX and
topotecan compared to HEK293/pcDNA3.1 (Table 1).
The test compound A-803467 at 7.5 μM significantly
increased the cytotoxicity of MX and topotecan in
ABCG2-transfected cell lines (Table 1). In addition,
the reversal effect of A-803467 on ABCG2-mediated
MDR was comparable to the effect produced by 5 μM
of FTC, a known ABCG2 inhibitor. However, A-803467
did not sensitize ABCG2-transfected cells to cisplatin,
a non-substrate of ABCG2 (Table 1). Furthermore, the
reversal effect of A-803467 was also analyzed in parental
H460, and drug selected ABCG2 overexpressing H460/
MX20 cells. We found similar results where A-803467
significantly increased the cytotoxicity of MX and
topotecan in ABCG2 overexpressing H460/MX20
cells (Table 2). However, A-803467 did not sensitize
the parental H460 cells to MX and topotecan (Table 2).
Independently, we also analyzed the effect of A-803467
on ABCB1- and ABCC10-mediated  MDR. We found

that A-803467 did not affect the ABCB1- and ABCC10mediated MDR in ABCB1 overexpressing HEK293/
ABCB1 cells and ABCC10 overexpressing HEK293/
ABCC10 cells, respectively (Table 3). Together these
results indicate that A-803467 selectively and significantly
reverses the ABCG2-mediated MDR.

cells is due to the inhibitory effect of A-803467 on the
drug efflux function of the ABCG2 transporter.

A-803467 decreases the efflux of [3H]-MX in cells
overexpressing ABCG2
We accomplished a time course [3H]-MX efflux,
with or without A-803467, in ABCG2-transfected cells
to determine if the increase in intracellular [3H]-MX
accumulation caused by A-803467 was due to inhibition
of [3H]-MX efflux. We observed the efflux rate
of [3H]-MX was significantly higher in ABCG2transfected cells as compared with HEK293/pcDNA3.1
cells. A-803467 at 7.5 μM significantly blocked the
intracellular [3H]-MX efflux at different time periods
(0, 30, 60 and 120 min) from ABCG2-transfected cells,
but not in the parental HEK293/pcDNA3.1 cells. In the
absence of A-803467, the accumulation of [3H]-MX in
HEK293/R482 cells at 30, 60 and 120 min were 72.5%,
62.7% and 52.4%, respectively. When HEK293/R482
cells were incubated with A-803467, the percentages
of [3H]-MX at 30, 60 and 120 min were increased to
86.5%, 84.3% and 72.0%, respectively (Fig. 1B).

A-803467 significantly augments the
intracellular accumulation of [3H]-MX in cells
overexpressing ABCG2
To investigate the reversal mechanism, we studied
the effect of A-803467 on the intracellular accumulation
of [3H]-MX in ABCG2 overexpressing cells. HEK293/
pcDNA3.1 and ABCG2-transfected cells were incubated
with [3H]-MX, a known substrate of ABCG2, with
or without A-803467 at different concentrations for
2 h. A-803467 at 7.5 μM significantly enhanced the
intracellular [3H]-MX accumulation in ABCG2-transfected
cells. However, A-803467 did not significantly impact
the intracellular accumulation in HEK293/pcDNA3.1
cells (Fig. 1A). These results suggest that the increased
intracellular levels of [3H]-MX in ABCG2 overexpressing

topotecan and MX stimulated the ATPase activity of ABCG2
in a concentration dependent manner, with a maximal
stimulation of 1.81-fold and 2.04-fold greater than the basal
activity, respectively (Fig. 3B and 3C). In addition, the
concentration of topotecan and MX required to obtain 50%
stimulation were 2.60 μM and 2.20 μM, respectively. These
results suggest A-803467 interacts at the drug-substratebinding site and stimulates the ATPase activity of ABCG2.

To analyze the effect of A-803467 on the ABCG2
expression, we incubated H460/MX20 cells with A-803467
(7.5 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h and found that there was no
significant change in the expression level of ABCG2 upon
A-803467 treatment (Fig. 2A). To analyze if A-803467
causes a translocation of ABCG2 from the plasma membrane
to the cytoplasm, contributing to a reduction of functional
ABCG2, we performed an immunofluorescence analysis
with H460 and ABCG2 overexpressing H460/MX20 cells.
The results showed that the membrane expression and
location of ABCG2, in H460/MX20 cells, was not altered
after treatment with A-803467 (7.5 μM) for 72 h (Fig. 2B).

Docking analysis of A-803467 with human
ABCG2 homology model
The best-scored docked position of A-803467 within
the large drug-binding cavity of human ABCG2 is shown
in Fig 4. The 4-chlorophenyl and furan carboxamide
substituents of A-803467 were stabilized into a hydrophobic
pocket formed by nearby residues Phe507, Ala580, Leu581,
Asn583, Gly625, Leu626, Trp627, Asn629 and His630. The
4-chlorophenyl ring of A-803467 may be involved in a π-π
interaction with the phenyl ring of Phe507 (centroid distance,
4.08 Å). The  3,  5-dimethoxyphenyl group of A-803467
was stabilized into the large cavity formed by side chains
of hydrophobic residues Ile412, Tyr464, Ser486, Phe489,
Ile573, Pro574 and Gly577. Moreover, the 3-methoxyphenyl
group also entered into a hydrogen bonding interaction with
Tyr464 (-O•••HO-Tyr464, 1.81 Å).

A-803467 stimulates the ATPase activity
of ABCG2
Several reversal agents have been reported as an
inhibitor and/or substrate of ABC transporters [33–36]. To
determine interaction of A-803467 with ABCG2 ATPase,
we performed an ATPase assay using membranes of High
Five insect cells overexpressing ABCG2 with different
concentrations of A-803467. A-803467 stimulated the
ATPase activity of ABCG2 in a concentration dependent
manner, with a maximal stimulation of 2.13-fold greater
than the basal activity (Fig. 3A). The inset of Fig. 3A
reveals the concentration of A-803467 required to obtain
50% stimulation is 0.718 μM. Similarly, we assessed the
effect of ABCG2 known substrates, topotecan and MX,
on the ATPase activity of ABCG2. We measured ABCG2mediated ATP hydrolysis in the presence of topotecan and
MX at various concentrations from 0 to 10 μM. Interestingly,

NCR nude mice. Topotecan alone at 3 mg/kg i.p. dose
demonstrated significant growth retardation in the parental

alone, and topotecan alone groups (Fig. 5A). Not only
was the H460/MX20 tumor growth minimized, but also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the size and weight of the tumors were significantly
reduced in the combination treatment group (Fig. 5B and
6A). It should be mentioned that A-803467 alone had no
significant effect on the growth rate of H460 (Fig. 5C and
6B) and H460/MX20 (Fig. 5A and Fig. 6A) xenografts.
Furthermore, topotecan with or without A-803467 did not
produce any apparent toxicity or weight loss (Fig. 6C).
Overall, A-803467 did not present any increased toxicity
in the mice, yet improved the efficacy of topotecan
in the ABCG2 overexpressing H460/MX20 resistant
xenograft model.

DISCUSSION
ABCG2 plays an important role in development
of drug resistance in clinical medicine. There is a
strong correlation between ABCG2 overexpression and
development of drug resistance in several cancer cells,

including NSCLC, colon carcinoma, hepatocellular
carcinoma (HCC) and breast cancer [37]. In the past four
years, there has been rising evidence for overexpression
of ABCG2 in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors;
in these studies, ABCG2 overexpression significantly
correlated with decreased patient survival [38]. The
ABCG2 transporter is present in certain populations
of cancer stem cells and normal primitive stem cells,
increasing the likelihood of overexpression and thus
resistance to various anticancer drugs [39–41]. Sensitizing
these cells to anticancer drugs with the help of ABC
transport reversal agents can effectively eradicate the
tumor population, leading to better clinical outcomes for
patients.
A wide variety of compounds that can inhibit
ABCG2 have been comprehensively studied [42]. ABCG2
inhibitors include, fumitremorgin C (FTC), the FTC
analogue Ko143, the acridone carboxamide derivative
GF120918, anti-HIV protease inhibitors nelfinavir and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

ritonavir, the dietary flavonoids chrysin and biochanin
A, the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and imatinib
[43], and some herbal extracts [44]. ABCG2 inhibitors
such as Ko143, GF120918 and gefitinib are highly
potent with their IC50 values in nano molar range. FTC
and Ko143 are highly selective in inhibiting the ABCG2
transporter, whereas rest of the compounds seems to be
general inhibitors of ABC transporters [42]. The selective
ABCG2 inhibitors such as FTC and Ko 143 are effective
only in vitro [45]. Several ABCG2 inhibitors have been
identified but none of them are in clinical use due to
toxicity and pharmacokinetic uncertainty. Hence there is
still an ongoing search for a safer and specific inhibitor of
the ABCG2 transporter.
In order to identify novel inhibitors of ABCG2, a
cell based assay using MTT in ABCG2 overexpressing
H460/MX20 cells was used to screen libraries of
compounds. Similar approaches have been carried out
by many researchers to obtain the inhibitors specific

to ABCG2 [46]. In our study, we screened several
tyrosine kinase inhibitors, synthetic small molecule
inhibitors[47, 51] and ion channel inhibitors for activity in
ABCG2 overexpressed cells and found that A-803467 was
effective in inhibiting ABCG2 mediated drug resistance at
micro molar concentrations.
One of the major findings of this study was that
A-803467 significantly increased the sensitivity of
ABCG2 overexpressing H460/MX20 cells to ABCG2
substrates such as topotecan and MX (Table 2). In
addition, A-803467 did not enhance the cytotoxic effect
of cisplatin, a drug that is not a substrate for the ABCG2
transporter, further demonstrating the specificity of
A-803467. Moreover, previous studies have found that
the 482nd position in ABCG2 is a hot spot for mutation,
Arg482 to Gly482 or Thr482 mutant variants of ABCG2
have shown to be significant in substrate specificity as well
as the potency of ABCG2 antagonist [26, 52]. Robey et al.
further reported that the activity of the ABCG2 transporter
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

varies in these mutant cell lines. For example, novobiocin
only antagonizes wild-type ABCG2 but does not show any
effect in mutant variants. However, FTC has been shown
to inhibit both wild-type as well as mutant ABCG2 [26].
This study has revealed that similar to FTC, A-803467
significantly enhances the chemosensitivity of ABCG2
substrates in both the cells with wild-type Arg482 and
mutant Gly482 or Thr482 of ABCG2 (Table 1). These
results clearly demonstrate the A-803467 activity in
the aforementioned mutants of ABCG2. Furthermore,
A-803467 could not reverse ABCB1- and ABCC10mediated drug resistance in cells overexpressing ABCB1
and ABCC10 transporters (Table 3); thus implying that the
reversal effect of A-803467 is ABCG2 specific.
In order to find the possible mechanism of action
of A-803467, we investigated its effect on the ABCG2
expression. In this study, A-803467 at 7.5 μM did not
significantly alter the expression of the ABCG2 protein
in H460/MX20 cells (Fig. 2A). In addition, A-803467

did not translocate the ABCG2 protein from the cell
membrane after 72 h of treatment (Fig. 2B). This clearly
demonstrates that reversal of MDR by A-803467 is
unlikely due to its decreasing ABCG2 protein expression
or a translocation and most likely due to the interaction
with ABCG2. Further functional analysis was performed
by measuring the intracellular accumulation of [3H]-MX
in wild-type HEK293/R482, mutant HEK293/R482T,
and mutant HEK293/R482G cells (Fig. 1A). In addition,
we also investigated the effect of A-803467 on the efflux
of [3H]-MX in wild-type HEK293/R482 cells (Fig. 1B).
A-803467 at 7.5 μM produced a significant increase in
accumulation of MX by inhibiting the efflux function
in the forenamed cell lines but not in parental HEK293/
pcDNA3.1 cells.
To further understand the interaction of A-803467
with ABCG2, we performed an ATPase assay using
ABCG2 overexpressed membranes. The majority of TKIs
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that interact with the ABC drug transporters stimulate ATP
hydrolysis [53] and the fact that A-803467 stimulates the
ATP hydrolysis of ABCG2 in a concentration dependent
manner (Fig. 3A) indicates that it behaves similar to other
known substrates (Fig. 3B and 3C) of ABCG2 transporter,
such as MX and topotecan. These results further prove
that A-803467 not only interacts directly with the ABCG2
transporter, but may also be a competitive inhibitor of
the transporter.
To identify the molecular interaction of A-803467
with the ABCG2 transporter, docking simulation
was performed at various sites of the human ABCG2
homology model. The crystal structure of human ABCG2
transporter is not completely elucidated. Comparing the
docking scores shown in Table 4, the most favorable
binding site was identified as site-1. Molecular docking
of topotecan, a well-known ABCG2 substrate, at the
same site of ABCG2 was performed. The docking

score of topotecan (-5.57 kcal/mol) is much higher than
that of A-803467 (-8.07 kcal/mol). The lower docking
score indicates stronger interaction between A-803467
to ABCG2 (Fig. 4). Moreover, molecular structure of
A-803467 also exhibited the pharmacophoric features
such as hydrophobic groups, aromatic ring centers (phenyl
ring and furan ring) and hydrogen bond acceptors that
have been reported as essential for ABCG2 inhibition [54].
Overall, this molecular simulation will provide clues to
optimize further derivatives of ABCG2 inhibitors.
To our knowledge, this is the first study that
demonstrates the combined effect of A-803467 with
anticancer drug topotecan in NCR nude mice implanted
with ABCG2 overexpressing H460/MX20 cells. The dose
and route of administration of A-803467 (35 mg/kg, p.o)
was chosen based on our preliminary study (data not
shown). A-803467 was administered on the 2nd and 3rd day
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

before administration of topotecan to compensate for its
high binding to plasma proteins. Jarvis et al., reported that
A-803467 was highly bound (98.7%) to plasma proteins
in rats [20]. The in vivo study results indicated that
A-803467 in combination with topotecan, significantly
decreased the tumor growth in mice implanted with
ABCG2 overexpressing H460/MX20 cells (Fig 5A, 5B
and 6A). A-803467 effectively restored the sensitivity of
tumors overexpressing ABCG2 transporter to topotecan
without having any significant effect on tumors lacking
ABCG2 expression (Fig. 5C, 5D and 6B). Furthermore,
A-803467 alone, or in combination with topotecan, did
not produce significant observable toxicity or weight loss
during the study period (Fig. 6C). The safety profile of
A-803467 in humans is not investigated yet, but currently
A-803467 is in pre-clinical testing stage for neuropathic
and inflammatory pain [20]

MATERIALS AND METHODS

ABCG2 is responsible for the “side population”
(SP) phenotype, frequently used in the identification and
isolation of cancer stem cells (CSCs). ABCG2 has also
been suggested as a prognostic biomarker as well as a
novel therapeutic target for the eradication of CSCs [40].
Presently, conventional chemotherapeutic anticancer
agents target highly proliferative tumor cells. The CSCs
survive such chemotherapy due to their high expression
of ABCG2 transporter, mediating their chemoresistance,
and ultimately leading to tumor relapse and metastasis.
Completely eradicating cancer stem cells by overcoming
the resistance to chemotherapy, mediated by ABCG2,
would be a new targeted therapeutic strategy. This study
suggests that combined therapy of A-803467 with ABCG2
substrates may provide a more effective way of sensitizing
ABCG2-mediated MDR and possibly eliminating CSCsIn
conclusion, A-803467, a tetrodotoxin resistant sodium
channel blocker, effectively inhibits membrane ABCG2
function, without affecting its expression or cellular
location and re-sensitizes the ABCG2 substrates in
ABCG2 overexpressing cells. A-803467, even at micro
molar concentrations, stimulates ATP hydrolysis of the
ABCG2 transporter with strong binding interactions
at the transmembrane site of the transporter. A-803467
significantly potentiates the antitumor efficacy of
topotecan in tumor xenograft nude mice. Therefore, it
is likely that A-803467, in combination with anticancer
agents that are ABCG2 substrates, would be very useful in
the treatment of certain drug resistant cancers.

DMSO were added to dissolve the formazan crystals. Cell
viability was measured at a wavelength of 570 nm. All the
experiments were repeated at least 3 times, and the mean and

[3H]-MX accumulation and efflux assay
We examined the effect of A-803467 on the
intracellular accumulation and efflux of [3H]-MX in
ABCG2-overexpressing cells as previous described [30].
Briefly, the cells (5 × 106/cells) were resuspended and
incubated in the RPMI 1640 medium in the presence or
absence of A-803467 (7.5 μM) or FTC (5 μM) at 37°C
for 2 h. Cells were then incubated with 0.01 μM [3H]MX containing medium for additional 2 h at 37°C, with
or without A-803467 (7.5 μM) or FTC (5 μM), and
subsequently washed twice with ice-cold PBS. For the
accumulation assay, cells were lysed by the 10 mM lysis
buffer (pH 7.4, containing 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2%
SDS) and then placed in scintillation fluid. For the efflux
assay, the suspended cells were then cultured in [3H]-MX
free medium, with or without A-803467 (7.5 μM) or FTC
(5.0  μM) at 37°C. The aliquots of cells were harvested
at the indicated times (0, 30, 60, and 120 min), and then
washed with ice-cold PBS and transferred to respective
scintillation vials. The radioactivity was measured using the
Packard TRI-CARB1 190`A liquid scintillation analyzer.

Dynex Technologies (Chantilly, VA). Packard TRI-CARB1
1900CA liquid scintillation analyzer was purchased from
Packard Instrument Company, Inc (Downers Grove, IL).
Nikon eclipse TE2000-S fluorescence microscope was

Cell lines and cell culture
HEK293/pcDNA3.1, wild-type HEK293/R482,
mutant HEK293/R482T and mutant HEK293/R482G
cells were established by transfecting HEK293 cell with
either the empty pcDNA3.1 vector or pcDNA3.1 vector
containing a full-length ABCG2, with coding arginine (R),
threonine (T), or glycine (G) at amino acid position 482,
respectively, after selection with G418 and maintained in
medium with 2 mg/ml of G418 [26]. HEK293/ABCB1 and
HEK293/ABCC10 cell lines were generated by selection
with G418 (2 mg/ml) after transfecting HEK293 cell with
ABCB1 vector or ABCC10 vector, respectively [27]. The
human lung cancer cell line H460, and its MX-selected
derivative ABCG2-overexpressing cell line H460/MX20
were used in the study [28]. All cell lines were maintained
in RPMI 1640 or DMEM medium, containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and cultured
in an incubator at 37°C with 5% CO2.

Western blot analysis
Cell lysates were prepared as described previously
[31]. Equal amounts of total cell lysates (30 μg protein)
were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and electrophoretically
transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF)
membranes. After incubation in a blocking solution (5%
milk) for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were
immunoblotted overnight with primary monoclonal
antibodies against actin at 1:1000 dilution or ABCG2 at
1:500 dilution at 4°C, and were then further incubated
for 2 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxide
(HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 dilution).
The protein–antibody complex was detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham, NJ).

Cell viability assay
Cytotoxicity tests and reversal experiments were
performed using the MTT colorimetric assay as described
previously [29]. Cells were harvested and resuspended
in a final concentration of 6 × 103 cells/well for HEK293/
pcDNA3.1, HEK/ABCB1, HEK/ABCC10, HEK293/R482,
HEK293/R482G and HEK293/R482T cells, and 4 × 103
cells/well for H460 and H460/MX20 cells. Cells were seeded
evenly into 96-well plates. To determine the cytotoxicity
of A-803467, different concentrations of drug were added
into the each well after 24 h of incubation. To determine the
reversal capability of A-803467, various concentrations of
chemotherapeutic drugs were added into designated wells
after 2 h preincubation with A-803467, FTC, verapamil or
cepharanthine. After 68 h of drug incubation, MTT reagent
(4 mg/mL) was added. The plates were incubated for an
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Immunofluorescence analysis
For immunofluorescence analysis, H460 and
H460/MX20 cells were seeded in 24 well plates. Cells
were incubated with or without A-803467 (7.5 μM)
for 72 h. Thereafter, cells were washed with PBS and
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room
temperature and then rinsed with PBS three times,
followed by permeabilization with 1% triton X-100 for
10 min at 4°C. Cells were again washed for three times

with PBS, and then blocked with 2 mg/ml of BSA for
1 h at 37°C. Fixed cells were incubated with monoclonal
antibody against ABCG2 (BXP 21) (1:50) for 16 h at
4°C, followed by three washes with PBS. The cells were
then further incubated with Alexa flour 488 goat antimouse IgG (1:60) for 1 h at 37°C. DAPI was used for
nuclear counterstaining. Immunofluorescence images
were taken with a Nikon fluorescence microscope.

previously explained [41]. H460/MX20 cells (6 × 106)
and H460 cells (4 × 106) were injected subcutaneously
under the right and left armpit regions of the nude mice,
respectively. We performed a pilot study using three
different doses of A-803467 (17.5, 35 and 70 mg/kg) and
we found that 35 mg/kg dose was effective in increasing
the topotecan sensitivity in tumors without significantly
increase toxicity, therefore 35 mg/kg dose was used
throughout the following study.
The mice were randomized into 4 groups (n = 6)
when the tumors attained a mean diameter of 0.5 cm
(day 0), and then received treatments as follows: (a)
Vehicle (10% N-methyl pyrrolidine (NMP) in PEG-300,
p.o., every 2nd and 3rd day; total 12 times), (b) A-803467
diluted in 10% NMP in PEG-300 (35 mg/kg, p.o., every
2nd and 3rd day; total 12 times), (c) Topotecan (3.0 mg/
kg, i.p., every 3rd day; total 6 times), and (d) A-803467
(35 mg/kg, every 2nd and 3rd day; total 12 times, given 1 h
before topotecan) + topotecan (3.0 mg/kg, i.p., every 3rd
day: total 6 times). The body weights of the mice were
monitored and the two perpendicular diameters of tumors
(A and B) were recorded every 4th day, and tumor volumes
(V) were calculated according to the following formula
described previously [41].

ABCG2 ATPase assay
The Vi-sensitive ATPase activity of ABCG2 in the
membrane vesicles of High Five insect cells was measured
as previously described. The membrane vesicles (100 μg
protein/ml) were incubated in ATPase assay buffer with
or without 0.3 mM vanadate at 37°C for 5 min and then
incubated with different concentrations of A-803467
ranging from 0 to 80 μM, topotecan, and MX (0 – 30 μM),
at 37°C for 3 min. The ATPase reaction was induced by
the addition of 5 mM Mg-ATP, and the total volume was
0.1 mL. After incubation at 37°C for 20 min, the reactions
were stopped by loading 0.1 mL of 5% SDS solution.
The liberated inorganic phosphate (Pi) was measured as
described previously [28]

Molecular modeling
A-803467 was prepared as ligands for docking
simulation onto human ABCG2 homology model following
the same protocols as previously described [32]. All grids of
ABCG2 were prepared and generated as per our previous
protocols [32]. Grid-1 generated using residue Arg482 as the
centroid had the highest docking score; therefore, docking
discussion was based on binding position of A-803467 at this
site. Glide v6.0 (Schrödinger, LLC, New York, NY, 2013)
docking protocol was followed with the default parameters.
Top scoring conformation was used for graphical analysis.
All computations were carried out on a Dell 490n dual
processor with Linux OS (Ubuntu 12.04 LTS).

The ratio of growth inhibition (IR) described
previously [41] was estimated according to the formula
given below.

Statistical analysis

Athymic NCr (nu/nu) nude mice, weighing 18 to
22 g (Taconic Farms, NCRNU-M, Homozygous, Albino
color), were used for the ABCG2 xenograft models.
All animals were provided with sterilized water and rodent
chow ad libitum and maintained with an alternating 12 h
light/dark cycle. All the experiments were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee (IACUC) of
St. John’s University, and were carried out in accordance
with the guidelines from Animal Welfare Act and The U.S.
Public Health Service.

All experiments were repeated at least three times
and the differences were determined by using the oneway ANOVA followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test
for comparing multiple groups with one variable in the
following experiments: cell viability assay, accumulation
assay, quantification of immunoblotting and tumor weight
measurement. Statistical analysis was performed by two
way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc test for
comparing multiple groups with more than one variable in
the following experiments: efflux assay, tumor growth rate
measurement and body weight measurement. Statistical
analysis was performed by un-paired student t-test for
comparing two groups in immunoblotting. Statistical
significance was set at P < 0.05. Statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism version 6.01 for
Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA).
