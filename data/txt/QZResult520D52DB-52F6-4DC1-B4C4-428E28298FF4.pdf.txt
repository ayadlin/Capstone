and Indocyanine Green

Abstract
Near-infrared (NIR) fluorophores have several advantages
over visible fluorophores, including improved tissue penetration and lower autofluorescence; however, only indocyanine
green (ICG) is clinically approved. Its use in molecular
imaging probes is limited because it loses its fluorescence
after protein binding. This property can be harnessed to
create an activatable NIR probe. After cell binding and
internalization, ICG dissociates from the targeting antibody,
thus activating fluorescence. ICG was conjugated to the
antibodies daclizumab (Dac), trastuzumab (Tra), or panitumumab (Pan). The conjugates had almost no fluorescence in
PBS but became fluorescent after SDS and 2-mercaptoethanol,
with a quenching capacity of 10-fold for 1:1 conjugates and
40- to 50-fold for 1:5 conjugates. In vitro microscopy showed
activation within the endolysosomes in target cells. In vivo
imaging in mice showed that CD25-expressing tumors were
specifically visualized with Dac-ICG. Furthermore, tumors
overexpressing HER1 and HER2 were successfully characterized in vivo by using Pan-ICG(1:5) and Tra-ICG(1:5), respectively. Thus, we have developed an activatable NIR optical
probe that ‘‘switches on’’ only in target cells. Because both the
antibody and the fluorophore are Food and Drug Administration approved, the likelihood of clinical translation is
improved. [Cancer Res 2009;69(4):1268–72]

Introduction
Molecular imaging probes that use near-infrared (NIR, emission
spectra f700–850 nm) fluorophores offer several advantages over
visible fluorophores. NIR probes have better tissue penetration, less
autofluorescence, and large Stokes shifts, allowing better rejection
of excitation light (1, 2). Only indocyanine green (ICG), which has
absorption at f780 nm and emission at f820 nm, has been
approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is in
clinical use for over 30 years with an excellent safety record (3, 4).
Unfortunately, the conjugation chemistry of ICG is difficult because
of its amphophilicity and few functional groups. Although protein
binding is possible, once bound to protein, ICG dramatically loses
its fluorescence. That feature has dissuaded investigators from
using ICG in molecular imaging probes. However, this property can
be harnessed to create activatable NIR optical probes.

Activation of optical probes can be achieved using mechanisms
including photon-induced electron transfer (5, 6), self-quenching
(homo-FRET; ref. 7), and quencher-fluorophore interaction (heteroFRET). Activation leads to high tumor-to-background ratios
because unbound agents yield little signal. Once ICG conjugated
with proteins, fluorescence is markedly decreased (8–10). However,
upon catabolism, light is once again emitted.
A probe that targets cells and internalizes could lead to high
tumor-to-background ratios if the probe activates upon internalization. By combining ICG with FDA-approved monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed at cell surface markers overexpressed on
cancers (anti-CD25, anti-EGFR1, and anti-HER2), we show the
feasibility of using ICG-mAb conjugates as activatable in vivo
molecular imaging probes. The possibilities of clinical translation
are greatly enhanced because both components of this probe, the
targeting moiety and the fluorophore, are already FDA approved.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. ICG-sulfo-OSu was purchased from Dojindo Molecular
Technologies. The following mAbs were used: daclizumab (Dac), humanized
mAb to the IL-2Ra (CD25; Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc.); panitumumab (Pan),
human anti-HER1 IgG2 mAb (AMGEN, Inc.); trastuzumab (Tra), humanized
anti–HER-2 mAb (Genentech, Inc.); and human polyclonal IgG, a control
antibody (Sigma Chemical). ZsGreen plasmid was purchased from Clontech
Laboratories, Inc. All other chemicals used were of reagent grade.
Synthesis of ICG-conjugated antibodies. Daclizumab (1 mg, 6.8 nmol)
was incubated with ICG-sulfo-OSu (6.8 or 68 nmol) in 0.1 mol/L Na2HPO4
(pH 8.5) at room temperature for 30 min. The mixture was purified with
a Sephadex G50 column (PD-10; GE Healthcare). The protein concentration
was determined with CoomassiePlus protein assay kit (Pierce Biotechnology). The concentration of ICG was measured by absorption with the
UV-Vis system to confirm numbers of fluorophore molecules conjugated to
each trastuzumab molecule. The absorption was also measured in 5% SDS
and 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), which were added to diminish hydrophobic
interaction among ICG molecules and between ICG and the antibody. For
HER1 or HER2 targeting studies, panitumumab or trastuzumab were,
respectively, conjugated with ICG in the same manner as daclizumab. The
number of ICG per antibody was 4 to 5 for the 1:10 reaction condition and
1 for the 1:1 reaction condition. Consequently, Dac-ICG(1:5), Pan-ICG(1:5),
and Tra-ICG(1:5) were prepared under 1:5 antibody/ICG conditions, and
Dac-ICG(1:1) and Tra-ICG(1:1) were prepared under 1:1 antibody/ICG
conditions. Control human polyclonal IgG-Cy5.5 was synthesized in the
similar manner as above using Cy5.5-NHS ester (GE Healthcare). The
number of Cy5.5 per antibody was adjusted to 1.
Determination of quenching ability in vitro. For investigation of the
quenching ability of bound ICG, all conjugates were treated with 5% SDS
and 2-ME to diminish hydrophobic k-k interactions and separate IgG
chains. The change in fluorescence intensity for each conjugate was
investigated with an in vivo imaging system (Maestro, CRi, Inc.) using 710
to 760 nm excitation and 800 nm long-pass emission filters.
Cell culture. For IL-2Ra targeting studies, the IL-2Ra+ ATAC4 cell was
used. As a negative control, the red fluorescent protein–transfected

IL-2Ra A431 cell (A431/DsRed) was used. For HER1 and HER2 targeting
studies, HER1-positive A431 and MDA-MB468 cells and HER2
gene–transfected NIH3T3 (3T3/HER2+) cell were used. Cell lines
were grown in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum (Life Technologies), 0.03% L-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and
100 Ag/mL streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37jC.
Fluorescence microscopy studies. 3T3/HER2+ cells (1  104) were
plated on a covered glass-bottomed culture well and incubated for 16 h.
Then, Tra-ICG(1:1) or Tra-ICG(1:5) was added to the medium (30 Ag/mL)
and the cells were incubated for either 1 or 8 h. Cells were washed once with
PBS, and fluorescence microscopy was performed using an Olympus BX61
microscope (Olympus America, Inc.) equipped with the following filters:
excitation wavelength 672.5 to 747.5 nm, emission wavelength 765 to 855
nm. Transmitted light differential interference contrast images were also
acquired.
Animal tumor model. All procedures were carried out in compliance
with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animal Resources (1996),
National Research Council, and approved by the NIH Animal Care and Use
Committee. For IL-2Ra targeting studies, ATAC4 cells (IL-2Ra+, 2  106)
and A431/DsRed cells (IL-2Ra , 2  106) were injected s.c. in the left and
right dorsum of the mice, respectively. The experiments were performed
14 to 18 d after cell injection.
For HER1 and HER2 targeting studies, MDA-MB468 (HER1+, HER2 , 2 
106 cells), A431 (HER1+, HER2 , 2  106 cells), and 3T3/HER2+ (HER1 ,
HER2+, 2  106 cells) were injected s.c. into the left flank, right buttock, and
right flank, respectively.

In vivo CD25 targeted imaging studies. Dac-ICG(1:1) or Dac-ICG(1:5)
(50 Ag) was injected via the tail vein into ATAC4 and A431/DsRed tumorbearing mice. The mice were anesthetized with i.p. administered 10%
sodium pentobarbital with 0.1% scopolamine butyl bromide; then, spectral
fluorescence images were obtained with the Maestro (CRi) using two filter
sets before and 1, 2, 3, and 4 d after injection. Two filter sets (green:
excitation, 505–545 nm; emission, long-pass >563 nm and NIR: excitation,
710 to 760 nm; emission, long-pass >700 nm) were used to detect DsRed and
ICG fluorescence. The spectral fluorescence images consisting of ICG,
DsRed, and autofluorescence spectra were then unmixed based on their
spectral patterns using commercial software (Maestro software, CRi). The
regions of interest were placed on ICG spectrum images with reference to
the white light and DsRed spectrum images to measure fluorescence
intensities of ATAC4 and A431/DsRed tumors and body (background). After
imaging at day 4, mice were sacrificed with carbon dioxide. Then, ex vivo
imaging of the resected tumors was performed. Dissected lesions were
embedded and stained with H&E.
In vivo tumor characterization study with HER1+ and HER2+
tumor-bearing mice. Three tumor-bearing mice, two HER1+HER2
(MDA-MB468 and A431) and one HER2+HER1 (3T3/HER2+), were used.
Pan-ICG(1:5) or Tra-ICG(1:5) (50 Ag) was injected via tail vein and images
were obtained 4 d after injection using the Maestro (CRi) with the ICG
filter set. Histologic examination was performed with H&E staining.

Tra-ICG, control polyclonal human IgG-Cy5.5 was coinjected (50 Ag, i.v.)
with either Pan-ICG(1:5) or Tra-ICG(1:5) (50 Ag, i.v.). In vivo and ex vivo
spectral fluorescence images were obtained 4 d after injection into HER1+
and HER2+ tumor-bearing mice described above using Maestro. Two filter
sets (red: excitation, 615–665 nm; emission, long-pass >700 nm and NIR:
excitation, 710–760 nm; emission, long-pass >800 nm) separated Cy5.5 and
ICG fluorescence. The fluorescence images consisting of spectra from ICG,
Cy5.5, and autofluorescence were then unmixed with commercial software
(Maestro software version 2.4, CRi) using the multiexcitation spectral

analysis function. The dissected tumors were embedded in paraffin and
stained with H&E.

Results
Antibody-fluorophore conjugates show high quenching
capacity. The molecular interaction of ICG and mAb can be
dissociated and disrupted with SDS and 2-ME treatments.

a, Tra-ICG(1:5)–injected mouse; b, Pan-ICG(1:5)–

the injection. Only the target-specific tumor was
detected and tumor characterization was successful.
B, human polyclonal human IgG-Cy5.5 was
coinjected with Tra-ICG(1:5) (a) or Pan-ICG(1:5) (b)
to validate specific accumulation. Only the target
tumor was visualized with each specific
ICG-conjugated antibody; however, all tumors were
detected with IgG-Cy5.5. C, H&E staining of
dissected tumors (bar, 200 Am).

Fluorescence intensity was low for all antibody-fluorophore
conjugates before 5% SDS and 2-ME treatments; intense fluorescence was detected after dissociation (Fig. 1). The quenching
capacities were 43, 6, 58, 44, and 10 for Dac-ICG(1:5), Dac-ICG(1:1),
Pan-ICG(1:5), Tra-ICG(1:5), and Tra-ICG(1:1), respectively.
In vitro microscopic studies show fluorescence activation
only within target HER2+ cells. Fluorescence was not observed
for either Tra-ICG(1:1) or Tra-ICG(1:5) inside the HER2+ cells after
1-h incubation; however, by 8 h, both conjugates showed fluorescence, which were brighter for Tra-ICG(1:5) than Tra-ICG(1:1)
(Fig. 2). These results show that fluorescence activation occurs only
after internalization within target cells, and minimal fluorescence
is found outside the cell.
In vivo studies: target tumor was specifically visualized with
ICG-conjugated daclizumab with high tumor-to-background
ratio. The time course fluorescence intensity in ATAC4 (IL2-Ra+)
and A431/DsRed (IL2-Ra ) tumors after Dac-ICG(1:5) or DacICG(1:1) is summarized in Fig. 3. The fluorescence increased only in
target ATAC4 tumors and was higher for Dac-ICG(1:5) than DacICG(1:1). The background and nontarget tumor fluorescence was
low for both Dac-ICG(1:1) and Dac-ICG(1:5), whereas control
human polyclonal IgG-Cy5.5 conjugate yielded similar fluorescence
in both tumors (Supplementary Fig. S1). Histologic findings of both
genetically modified A431 tumors were identical (Fig. 3C). The liver
uptake was higher for Dac-ICG(1:5) (Fig. 3B). This high liver uptake
affected the measured fluorescence intensity in A431/DsRed
tumors just after Dac-ICG(1:5) injection (day 0), because tumors
located near the liver. To check the cause of slight fluorescence
from the body for Dac-ICG(1:5), blood fluorescence was measured
1 d after injection. However, the ICG signal was not detected in
blood samples (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Tumors overexpressing cell surface receptors were successfully characterized in vivo using their respective ICG-conjugated antibodies. HER1+ tumors (MDA-MB468 and A431) were
only visualized by Pan-ICG(1:5) and not by Tra-ICG(1:5). On the
other hand, the HER2+ tumor (3T3/HER2+) was imaged only by
Tra-ICG(1:5) (Fig. 4A). Coinjected control human polyclonal IgG
conjugated with Cy5.5 resulted in similar fluorescence in all three
tumors (Fig. 4B). Histologic findings of these three tumors showed
expected differences in histology (Fig. 4C).

Discussion
A growing number of humanized mAbs directed against tumorspecific cell surface antigens have gained FDA approval and are
successful in the clinic. If labeled with imaging ‘‘beacons,’’ these
mAbs could be used to diagnose and treat cancers. Such antibodies
can be ‘‘labeled’’ with chelates that bind radioactive metals useful
for diagnosis and therapy (11, 12). Radiolabeling, however, exposes
patients to ionizing radiation and results in imaging with poor
spatial and temporal resolution. Optical labeling overcomes these
disadvantages but suffers from poor tissue penetration, preventing
whole-body imaging. Among the fluorophores, NIR probes have the
greatest tissue penetration and among the NIR probes only ICG is
FDA approved for clinical use.
The use of ICG-conjugated antibodies has been limited because
ICG loses its fluorescence once it is covalently bound to protein
(8–10). Fluorescence, however, can be recovered from Ab-ICG
conjugates by application of 5% SDS and 2-ME that release the
ICG from the protein. Although the mechanism is still poorly
understood, it is likely that a noncovalent interaction between
the ICG and hydrophobic amino acids on IgG causes loss of
fluorescence. Of course, this effect can be combined with classic

self-quenching to produce even higher quenching capacities. For
instance, when the antibody to ICG ratio was increased to 1:5,
quenching capacities of 43- to 58-fold were observed versus
f6-fold for the 1:1 conjugation. This property can be exploited
in vivo. Trastuzumab binds to HER2 on the plasma membrane, and,
subsequently, gradually internalized into the cytoplasm and then
is delivered to lysosome to degenerate (13). It was observed in
HER2+ cells that Tra-ICG became activated after 8 h of incubation,
yielding virtually no signal before that. It is proposed that as TraICG is internalized and cut into component peptides, releasing
ICGs in the endosome-lysosome over 8 h. Similarly, uptake within
tumors can be shown with matched Ab-ICG conjugates and
antigen-expressing cell lines with minimal background signal.
Thus, Ab-ICG conjugates are capable of labeling tumors in vivo
with an FDA-approved NIR optical probe enabling tumors to be
detected below the skin surface.
The Ab-ICG(1:5) conjugate releases weakly bound ICG or is
partially trapped in the liver. ICG is catabolized in the liver and
excreted into the bile, hence its use in assessing hepatic function in
humans (14). Therefore, it is not surprising that considerable
uptake in the liver 1 day after injection could be cleared quickly.
This interfered with in vivo imaging by increasing scattered
background signal especially for tumors placed near the liver.
Fortunately, ICG is excreted relatively rapidly through the liver so
that by day 3 liver signal was greatly reduced. The phenomenon
of hepatic uptake was higher for the Ab:ICG(1:5) compounds;
however, this was balanced by a much higher signal from the
tumor itself.
Regarding clinical translation of Ab-ICG compounds, it is helpful
that both mAbs (daclizimab, panitumumab, and trastuzumab) and
the NIR fluorophore (ICG) are already FDA approved. Recognizing

that conjugates may have different toxicities than their individual
components, these agents will have to undergo extensive toxicity
testing before human use; however, the presence of two approved
agents in the conjugate certainly bodes well for its eventual
clearance for human use compared with fluorescent proteins,
which are excellent endogenous fluorescence emitters (15, 16), but
require in vivo transfection that is unlikely to be permitted in
humans in the near term (17).
Clinical translation of described agents will require detector/
scanner systems for in vivo NIR fluorescence imaging in humans.
NIR endoscopic cameras to assist surgery have been described
(18, 19). In addition, a NIR clinical breast scanner has recently
become available. Therefore, it is realistic to assume that this
technology could be adapted for use with the ICG-mAb conjugates
described here. Because the optical imaging system is simple and
inexpensive compared with other imaging methods, it is likely
that the method, if helpful in humans, would be readily accepted
by clinicians.
