ABSTRACT
Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2)-targeted therapy has attracted
considerable attention as novel anticancer agents in gastric cancer (GC). However,
intrinsic or acquired drug resistance has emerged as a major challenge to their clinical
use. In this study, we demonstrated that several receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK),
including EGFR, HER3 and MET, activations contributed to AZD4547 (a selective FGFR2
inhibitor) hyposensitivity in FGFR2 amplified GC cells. The rescue effect was abrogated
by inhibiting these RTKs with their targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In
addition, synergy in growth inhibition was observed when the GC cells were treated
with a combination of AZD4547 and cetuximab (an EGFR monoclonal antibody) both
in vitro and in vivo. More importantly, tissue microarray analysis revealed that these
resistance-conferring RTKs were highly expressed in FGFR2 positive GC patients.
Taken together, these observations demonstrated RTKs including EGFR, HER3 and MET
activations as novel mechanisms of hyposensitivity to AZD4547. It will be clinically
valuable to investigate the involvement of RTK-mediated signaling in intrinsic or
acquired resistance to FGFR2 TKIs in GC. A combination targeted therapeutic strategy
may be recommended for treating FGFR2 amplified GC patients with these RTK
activations.

INTRODUCTION

to FGFR2 inhibitors in preclinical models [4, 8]. Thus,
there is significant interest in FGFR2 as a therapeutic
target for FGFR2 amplified GCs, and clinical trials of
FGFR inhibitors are ongoing [9].
Several FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
such as dovitinib [6], ponatinib [10], NVP-BGJ398 [11]
and AZD4547 [8] have been able to inhibit growth of
GC cell lines harboring FGFR2 amplification and shrink
tumor xenograft using the same FGFR2 amplified cell
lines implanted in nude mice. Dovitinib is currently
being tested in a phase II trial as monotherapy in patients
with metastatic or unresectable gastric cancer with
either FGFR2 amplification or polysomy (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifier: NCT01719549). The selective FGFR
inhibitor AZD4547 is also under a randomized phase II

Dysregulation of the fibroblast growth factor
receptor (FGFR) signaling pathway due to receptor
overexpression, gene amplification, mutation or aberrant
transcriptional regulation is associated with cancer
development and progression in multiple myeloma and
cancers of the stomach, breast, bladder, lung, endometrium
and prostate [1]. In the case of gastric cancer (GC),
FGFR2 protein overexpression by immunohistochemistry
[2] was reported to be 30–40%, while the incidence of
FGFR2 amplification varies from 3–10% [3-6]. Therefore,
FGFR2 amplification may correlate with poor outcomes in
patients with diffuse-type gastric cancer [3, 5, 7]. GC cell
lines harboring FGFR2 amplification are highly sensitive

EGFR, HER3 and MET kinase activation
attenuates AZD4547 growth inhibition in FGFR2amplified GC cells

trial comparing AZD4547 to paclitaxel as second line
treatment of advanced GC and gastroesophageal junction
(GEJ) cancer harboring FGFR2 amplification or polysomy
(SHINE; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01457846).
Despite striking preclinical antitumor effects,
the long-term efficacy of small molecular TKIs in GC
is hampered by the emergence of primary or acquired
resistance [12-14]. Previous studies have led to the
identification of several TKI resistance mechanisms. One
common paradigm is that other RTKs can restore the
activation of key intracellular signaling pathways despite
inhibition of oncogenic kinase, leading to resistance [1517]. Recently, we reported that activation of several RTKs
were involved in HER2-positive GC unresponsiveness to
lapatinib (a HER2 TKI) [14]. However, whether and how
other RTK activations cause resistance to FGFR2 inhibitor
in GC remains unknown.
In this study, we identified multiple RTK,
including EGFR, HER3 and MET, activations as possible
mechanisms underlying FGFR2 inhibitor resistance
in FGFR2 amplified GC. We also demonstrated that
the combination of AZD4547 (FGFR2 inhibitor) and
cetuximab (EGFR monoclonal antibody) offered synergic
growth inhibition both in vitro and in vivo. Our results
provide a strong rationale for a combination strategy with
agents targeting FGFR2 and other resistance-enriched
RTKs.

To identify RTKs whose activation desensitizes
tumor cells to AZD4547, SNU16 and KATOIII cells were
treated with AZD4547 (0-10 nM) alone or accompanied
by five simultaneous treatments with different ligands,
including hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal
growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF), neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and insulin-like growth
factor (IGF) (50 ng/mL) for 72 hours. The results showed
that NRG1 and EGF rescued both SNU16 and KATOIII
cells from AZD4547-induced growth inhibition, whereas
HGF abrogated AZD4547 inhibition in SNU16 but
not KATOIII cells (Fig. 2A and Fig. 2B). As expected,
this ligand-induced AZD4547 hyposensitivity could
be blocked by co-targeting the secondary active RTKs
(erlotinib: EGFR; AZD8931: pan-HER and PF04217903:
MET), confirming that the ligands were acting via their
cognate RTKs (Fig. S1).
To investigate the molecular mechanism of RTK
ligand-induced AZD4547 hyposensitivity, we examined
phosphorylation of FGFR2, EGFR, MET, HER3, FRS2
and the PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK pathways by
western blotting. As anticipated, AZD4547 inhibited
the phosphorylation level of FGFR2, FRS2, AKT and
ERK1/2. Importantly, even in the presence of AZD4547,
EGF, NRG1 and HGF restored phosphorylation of FRS2,
AKT and ERK1/2, respectively (Fig. 2).
Since previous studies indicated heterodimers
between RTKs contributed to drug resistance [18], we
performed western blot and co-immunoprecipitation
analysis in attempt to detect heterodimers between
FGFR2 and other certain RTKs. The results revealed
that heterodimers between FGFR2 and EGFR/HER3/
MET existed in both SNU16 and KATOIII cells. In
contrast, SNU16 cells overexpressed MET, whereas
MET was barely detectable in KATOIII cells (Fig.S2).
Notably, according to the results from CCK-8 assay,
HGF could rescue SNU16 not KATOIII cells from
AZD4547 treatment. Our results suggested that ligandinduced AZD4547 hypersensitivity is related to basic
overexpression of certain RTKs rather than heterodimers
distribution.

RESULTS
FGFR2-amplified GC cells are selectively sensitive
to AZD4547 inhibition
To select FGFR2 amplified GC cells, we first
tested a panel of GC cell lines (SNU16, KATOIII, HGC27, MKN-28, MKN-45, SGC7901 and NCI-N87) for
their degrees of FGFR2 gene amplification and protein
expression. As shown in Fig. 1A, quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) determined that SNU16 and
KATOIII cells were FGFR2 gene amplified, and the rest
of the cell lines were not FGFR2 gene amplified. The
degree of FGFR2 amplification in SNU16 and KATOIII
cells corresponded to overexpression of FGFR2 proteins
in these cells (Fig. 1B).
To examine the sensitivity of GC cells to a TKI
targeting FGFR2, each cell line was exposed to increasing
doses of AZD4547 (Fig. 1C). Compared with FGFR2 nonamplified GC cells, SNU16 and KATOIII cells displayed
extreme sensitivity to AZD4547 (Fig. 1C). Fig. 1D shows
that a low dose of AZD4547 (10 nM) dephosphorylated
FGFR2, FGFR substrate 2 (FRS2), ERK1/2 and AKT in
these two cell lines.

AZD4547-induced sub-G1 cell cycle arrest
We then investigated the effect of alternative RTK
activations on cell cycle progression of SNU16 cells.
Consistent with a previous study [4], AZD4547 inhibited
cell growth via sub-G1 cell cycle arrest, as shown by an
increased proportion of cells in the sub-G1 phase measured
by flow cytometry. The addition of EGF, NRG1 or HGF to

arrest to enter normal cell cycle progression. This loss of
ligand-induced sub-G1 arrest was reversed by secondary
RTK inhibitors. We noted the restoration of sub-G1 arrest

corresponding RTK inhibitors (Fig. S3).

using the CCK-8 assay. The results showed that the
combination of AZD4547 and cetuximab resulted in a
significant increase in cell growth toxicity when compared
with either drug alone (p < 0.01). The combination index
(CI)/fractional effect curve showed that the synergistic
effects between these two agents became stronger as the
concentration increased (Fig. 3A, left).
Next, we analyzed the mechanism of the synergistic
interaction between AZD4547 and cetuximab. Western
blotting assay showed that administration of AZD4547
or cetuximab alone to SNU16 cells dephosphorylated
ERK1/2, whereas their combination resulted in a more
profound decrease in phosphorylation of ERK1/2. In
contrast, AKT phosphorylation was unchanged by the
AZD4547 and cetuximab combination compared with
single agent administration (Fig. 3A, right).

we examined the effect of individual and combination
treatment with AZD4547 (FGFR2 TKI) and cetuximab

Combination therapy with AZD4547 and cetuximab resulted in a significant increase in cell growth toxicity in SNU16 cells. Cells were
treated with increasing concentrations of the indicated drugs for 72 hours. The CI/fractional effects curve showed the synergistic antiproliferative effects of the combination drugs. Multiple drug analyses were conducted by calculating CI values. Data (n = 6) are presented

Combined effect of AZD4547 and cetuximab in an
SNU16 tumor xenograft model

with AZD4547 or cetuximab was not observed in any
of the groups. Taken together, co-treatment of these two
drugs demonstrated synergistic activity against SNU16
xenograft without enhanced toxicity (Fig. 3B).
Next, tumor sections containing viable cells from
each treatment group were selected to evaluate the impact
of the different therapies on SNU16 cell proliferation
and apoptosis (Fig. 4). Scoring of IHC staining for Ki67 (a nuclear marker for proliferation) demonstrated
a statistically significant reduction in proliferation
of SNU16 cells in the combination treated vs. PBS,
AZD4547 or cetuximab treated groups (18.6 ± 5.9 % vs.
84 ± 5.3 %, 56 ± 6.3 % or 47.8 ± 8.6 %, respectively;
p < 0.05). Similarly, TUNEL assay staining (marker for
apoptosis) analysis revealed that the combined AZD4547
and cetuximab induced a statistically significant increase
in SNU16 cells apoptosis (PBS: 3.4 ± 2.1; AZD4547:
9.4 ± 2.7; cetuximab: 12.4 ± 3.0; and combination: 24.8
± 5.8 TUNEL positive cells, respectively; p < 0.05). In

SNU-16 xenografts were established to evaluate
in vivo combination effect of AZD4547 and cetuximab.
Briefly, animals were treated with a low dose of AZD4547
(2mg/kg, q.d.), cetuximab (1mg per animal, on day 1, 4,
7, 11 14) or AZD4547 plus cetuximab. After treatment
for 21 days, AZD4547, cetuximab and their combination
significantly decreased tumor volume compared with
control group (PBS treated vs. AZD4547, cetuximab or
combination treated: 571.5 ± 96.7 mm3 vs. 226.6 ± 104.2
mm3, 193.18 ± 77.8 mm3, 48.9 ± 27.4 mm3, respectively;

gave tumor growth inhibition (TGI) values of 60.4 % and

addition, the synergistic effect of combinational therapy
of AZD4547 and cetuximab in vivo might be mediated by
downregulating phosphorylation of ERK1/2. As shown
in Fig 4, scoring of IHC staining for phosphorylation
of ERK1/2 was statistically reduced in the combination
treated vs. PBS, AZD4547 or cetuximab treated groups
(2.8 ± 2.2% vs. 83.8 ± 9.0 %, 32.4 ± 8.0 % or 26.6 ± 4.4%,
respectively; p < 0.05).

patients with FGFR2-positive GC, 28 (29.5%), 43 (45.3%)
and 16 (16.8%) were EGFR, HER3 and MET positive. In
addition, two RTK positives were detected in 16 (16.8%)
(EGFR/HER3), 8 (8.4%) (EGFR/MET) and 8 (8.4%)
(HER3/MET) cases, respectively. Notably, there were 5
(5.3%) samples that were triple positive (EGFR/HER3/
MET), and a typical example with positive staining for
each RTK is shown in Fig. 5.
Moreover, we performed FISH analysis to evaluate
FGFR2 gene amplification status and its association with
FGFR2 as well as other RTKs expression level (see Fig.
6). As a result, 4 samples from a total of 145 samples were
identified as FGFR2 amplified. In these four cases, two
cases were FGFR2 2+ while the other two were FGFR2
3+ by IHC assay. Furthermore, the positivity of HER3,
EGFR and MET in these four samples were detected in 3
(75%), 3 (75%) and 1 (25%) samples. Taken together, the
data from tissue microarray analysis (TMA) in our study
revealed that intrinsic resistance-conferring RTKs were
commonly enriched in FGFR2 positive GC, indicating the
potential clinical application of our preclinical studies.

EGFR, HER3 and MET are co-expressed in
FGFR2 positive GC tumors
Our in vitro data have demonstrated that FGFR2
TKI resistance is associated with EGFR, HER3 and
MET kinase activation. To further validate the clinical
significance of our findings, we investigated the expression
profile of these RTKs in 145 primary GC surgical samples.
Each RTK positivity definition by IHC assay is described
in the Materials and Methods. As indicated in Table 1,
FGFR2, EGFR, HER3 and MET positivity were detected
in 95 (65.5%), 107 (73.8%), 100 (69.0%) and 68 (46.9%)
samples, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, in the 95

DISCUSSION

that crosstalk between FGFR2 and the EGFR pathway
mutually affects the efficacy of the single targeted agent.
Moreover, dual inhibition of these two targeted therapies
might result in a synergistic antitumor effect.
To test our hypothesis, we used AZD4547 (FGFR2
TKI) and cetuximab (EGFR antibody) to block the
FGFR2 and EGFR signaling pathways. We showed
that dual inhibition of FGFR2 and EGFR activity
resulted in a synergistic effect in SNU16 cells through
cell viability assay (Fig. 3A). In addition, these in vitro
observations mirrored the synergistic antitumor activity
in vivo. The combination of AZD4547 and cetuximab
demonstrated striking tumor growth inhibition on SNU16
xenografts (Fig. 3B). This was confirmed by decreased
proliferation by Ki-67 staining and increased apoptosis
by TUNEL assay (Fig. 4). More importantly, our TMA
results showed that 29.5% of FGFR2 positive tumors
determined by IHC assay as well as 75% of FGFR2
amplified tumors identified by FISH analysis were EGFR
positive, indicating the potential clinical application of a
combination strategy to target both receptors.
Notably, HER3 and MET activation were also found
to confer AZD4547 hypersensitivity in FGFR2-amplified
GC cell lines. These findings echo the results of previous
studies demonstrating that NRG1 and HGF were able to
rescue KATOIII cells (FGFR2 amplified) and RT112 cells
(FGFR1 amplified) from another FGFR inhibitor BGJ398
[17]. Furthermore, TMA results showed that in FGFR2
positive tumors, the co-positivity rates of HER3 and
MET were 45.3% and 16.8%, respectively. Additionally,
FISH analysis showed that in FGFR2 amplified tumors,
75% and 25% tumors were HER3 and MET positive.
Considering the high co-positivity rate of these RTKs
in FGFR2 positive GC tumors, our results revealed the
possibility of FGFR2 TKI resistance in current and future

FGFR2 TKIs such as AZD4547 and BGJ398 are
currently under clinical investigation for patients with
FGFR2 amplified GC. Nonetheless, several issues remain,
principally for patients who cannot successfully be treated
with FGFR2 TKIs due to drug resistance. Due to lack of
systematic research, the mechanisms conferring intrinsic
resistance to FGFR2 TKIs are poorly defined in FGFR2
amplified GC.
Recently, we reported that several RTK activations,
including MET, HER3, IGF-1R and INSR, conferred
lapatinib unresponsiveness in HER2-positive GC [14].
Indeed, “alternative RTK pathway activation” has been
considered as a major cause of intrinsic and acquired
resistance against several targeted therapies [15, 17, 19,
20]. In the current study, we hypothesized that AZD4547
(FGFR2 TKI) unresponsiveness might also be associated
with activation of an alternative RTK pathway and tried
to identify the RTKs responsible. To test our hypothesis,
five RTKs known to be widely expressed in tumors
(EGFR, HER3, MET, PDGFR and IGFR) were assessed.
Through cell viability assay, we identified EGFR, HER3
and MET as key pathways modulating unresponsiveness
to AZD4547 in FGFR2-amplified GC cell lines.
We have herein described a novel mechanism for
FGFR2 TKI resistance in FGFR2 amplified GC through
activation of EGFR by its ligand EGF. Specifically, we
found that EGF increased growth in the presence of the
FGFR2 TKI AZD4547. This EGF-induced AZD4547
hyposensitivity was associated with loss of sub-G1 arrest
and phosphorylation of downstream effectors ERK1/2 and
AKT. Indeed, FGFR pathway activation by FGFs has been
implicated in resistance to EGFR TKIs, including geﬁtinib
and erlotinib, in NSCLC [21]. Thus, it is suggested

clinical trials.
An important goal of this work was to show
crosstalk between the FGFR2/ EGFR, HER3 or MET
pathways on 3 levels: firstly, receptors of these pathways
form homodimers or heterodimers between each other
and lead to transactivation with each other (Fig. S2);
secondly, crossphosphorylation of these RTKs leads to
reactivated FRS2 phosphorylation, a downstream substrate
of the FGFRs (Fig. 2); and thirdly, these RTKs share two
common downstream effectors, including ERK and AKT,
for which phosphorylation was up-regulated by added
ligands (Fig. 2). Notably, variability exists within cell
lines harboring FGFR2 amplification, potentially due
to differences in the baseline overexpression of certain
RTKs. As shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. S2, compared with
SNU16 cells, KATOIII cells presented a relatively lower
MET expression level, which could explain why HGF
failed to confer drug resistance to AZD4547 in this cell
line.
Taken collectively, EGFR, HER3 and MET
pathway activation was demonstrated to be related to
FGFR2 targeted therapy resistance in FGFR2 amplified
GC. In addition, the TMA results highlighted the
clinical implications for GC patients who may acquire
resistance to FGFR2 inhibitors. Given that AZD4547 and
other potent FGFR inhibitors are now entering clinical
practice, our novel approach will be particularly useful
in the application of patient selection strategies. More
importantly, a synergistic antitumor effect achieved
by combining AZD4547 with cetuximab provided a
compelling rationale for multi-targeted therapy in FGFR2
amplified GC.

concentration, with a final DMSO concentration < 0.2%
(v/v). DMSO was also added to the control cells in culture.

Cell proliferation assay and combination data
analysis
Assessment of cell viability was performed as
follows. Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells per well in
96-well plates and incubated overnight. Cells were then
treated with increasing concentrations of the indicated
drugs for 72 hours. Treatments at each concentration
were carried out in three replicate wells and repeated
three times. Cell viability was determined using the
CCK-8 according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Half
maximal inhibitory concentration was determined by
using the non-linear regression model in GraphPad Prism
version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA).
Combination effects on potency were evaluated
using the CI as described previously [22, 23], using
Calcusyn version 2.1 (Biosoft, Palo Alto, CA, USA), and
derived from the original concept of Chou and Talalay
[24]. In general, a CI value < 0.9, 0.9–1.1, or > 1.1
indicates synergy, additivity or antagonism, respectively.
CI/fractional effect curves represent the CI versus the
fraction of cells affected/killed by drugs in combination.

implanted subcutaneously via a Trocar needle into the
nude mice [4].

In vivo treatment of AZD4547 and cetuximab
When the SNU16 tumors had reached a mean
diameter of around 0.5 cm, usually 8– 10 days after tumor
implantation, the mice were assigned to four groups (n =
6 per group): (a) Vehicle; (b) AZD4547 2 mg/kg orally
once daily; (c) cetuximab 1 mg per animal intravenously
on days 1, 4, 7 and 14; and (d) combination AZD4547
and cetuxizumab. Each animal had its ear marked and
was followed individually throughout the experiments.
The diameters of the tumors as well as the animal body
weights were measured every 3 days, and tumor volume
was calculated using the following formula:
V (mm3) = V (mm3) = π x width (mm) x width (mm)
x length (mm)/6
When the designated treatments were completed,
the animals were euthanized according to the institutional
guidelines. Tumors were resected, weighed and ﬁxed
in formalin for parafﬁn embedding. To evaluate the
therapeutic efﬁcacy of the treatment, the tumor growth
inhibition rate was calculated using the following
equation:
TGI = 100% (mean tumor volume of control group
-mean tumor volume of experimental group)/mean tumor
volume of control group
Data are representatives of two independent
experiments.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mmol/L
Tris (pH 7.5), 100 mmol/L sodium chloride, 1 mmol/L
ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1% NP40 and
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. FGFR2 was
immunoprecipitated from total protein extracts (200 μg)
overnight, washed in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
0.1% Tween 20 buffer, and immunoblotted to detect
EGFR, HER3 and MET. Irrelevant immunoglobulin G
served as a negative control.

Cell cycle assay
Propidium iodide (PI) staining was performed to
determine the effect of AZD4547 on the cell cycle [25].
Briefly, 3 x 105/mL cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
exposed to AZD4547, AZD4547 plus NRG1/HGF/EGF
and/or AZD8931/PF04217903/erlotinib for 48 hours. Both
floating and trypsinized adherent cells were harvested,
fixed in 70% ethanol overnight and resuspended in PBS
containing PI (50 mg/mL) supplemented with ribonuclease
(100 mg/mL). The DNA content was determined by a
Cytomics FC 500 flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter,
Miami, FL, USA).

Histology and immunohistochemistry assay
The removed xenograft tumors were fixed with
4% neutral buffered paraformaldehyde and embedded
in paraffin before making tissue sections. Patient tissue
microarrays were constructed in collaboration with
Shanghai Biochip (Shanghai, China), as described
previously [26]. Patients’ clinicopathologic characteristics
are summarized in Table 2. All samples from patients
with GC were reviewed histologically after hematoxylin
and eosin staining. Representative cores were taken from
the paraffin blocks, away from necrotic and hemorrhagic
regions. Immunohistochemistry of the paraffin sections
was carried out using a 2-step protocol (MaxVision HRPPolymer Detection System; Maixin, Fuzhou, China)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
paraffin sections were deparaffinized and then rehydrated.
After microwave antigen retrieval, endogenous peroxidase
activity was blocked by incubation with 3% hydrogen
peroxide. Non-specific binding sites were blocked with
PBS containing 10% normal goat serum. The sections
were further incubated with the primary antibodies
against FGFR2 (R&D systems), MET (Roche), EGFR
(Cell Signaling Technology), HER3 (Thermo Fisher

Nude mice and xenografts
Female, 20-22 g (6-8-week-old) homozygous nude
athymic mice were purchased and raised under speciﬁc
pathogen-free conditions at the Shanghai Laboratory
Animal Center, China. All animal work must have been
conducted according to relevant national and international
guidelines. To develop the human breast xenografts, in
vitro growing SNU16 cells were harvested by exposure to
trypsin-EDTA, washed 3 times with PBS and implanted
into the right ﬂanks of the mice (106 cells in 0.1 mL
PBS). Once the volume of the tumor xenograft reached
approximately 300-500 mm3, it was excised and cut
into approximately 2 mm3 segments, which were further

number of centromeres. Amplification of FGFR2 was
defined as a FGFR2: chromosome 10 ratio of ≥ 2, or tight
FGFR2 gene clusters in ≥ 10% of the nuclei analyzed per
tissue section.

Evaluation of immunohistochemical results

Statistical analyses were performed with GraphPad
Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA,
USA). Quantitative variables were analyzed by the
Student’s t-test or one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni
post-test. Differences between cell viability and growth
curves were analyzed by two-way ANOVA followed by
Bonferroni’s multiple comparison test. SD of the mean
was indicated for each value by bar. All comparisons with
P < 0.05 are considered statistically significant.

Statistical analysis

Brown staining was evaluated as positive staining.
Ki-67 and p-ERK labeling percentages (LP) were
evaluated by counting tumor cells in ﬁve high-power
ﬁelds (x 200), and calculated as following: LP = number
of Ki-67 labeled nuclei or p-ERK labeled cytoplasm/total
number of cells counted x 100%.
TMA immunostaining was scored according to
a semi-quantitative 4-grade scale as follows: 0 = no
staining or unspecific staining of tumor cells, 1+ = weak
(intensity) and incomplete staining (quality) of more than
10% of tumor cells, 2+ = moderate and complete staining
of more than 10% of tumor cells, and 3+ = strong and
complete staining of more than 10% of tumor cells. All
stainings were scored as positive when a clear membrane
staining (2+ or 3+) was observed [14, 27, 28]. Slides were
independently evaluated by two investigators who were
blinded to the clinical information.

TUNEL assay

REFERENCES

TUNEL staining was carried out as described
previously [29]. Brieﬂy, 4 µm parafﬁn-embedded tissue
sections were prepared from the human xenograft tumors.
The slides were then subjected to TUNEL staining
using an in situ cell death detection kit following the
manufacturer’s protocol (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Mannheim, Germany). For TUNEL scoring, the average
numbers of positive nuclei were calculated in three highpower microscopic ﬁelds selected from a central region in
a viable tumor, in areas without necrosis.

Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis
For FISH analyses, 5 μm sections of the TMAs
directly labelled dual-colour DNA probes for FGFR2
(ZytoVision Ltd., Bremerhaven, Germany) was used.
Respective DNA probe sets were applied to the TMA
area and incubated overnight at 37°C. Subsequent to
several washing steps, nuclei were counterstained with
DAPI (4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) and analyzed by
epifluorescence microscopy. FISH scoring was performed
by counting fluorescence signals in 25 malignant, nonoverlapping cell nuclei for each case. The FISH ratio
was assessed as the number of genes proportional to the
