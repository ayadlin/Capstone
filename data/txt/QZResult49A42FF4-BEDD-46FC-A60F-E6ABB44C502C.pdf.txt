BACKGROUND. Little is known regarding chemotherapy medication errors in
pediatrics despite studies suggesting high rates of overall pediatric medication
errors. In this study, the authors examined patterns in pediatric chemotherapy
errors.

METHODS. The authors queried the United States Pharmacopeia MEDMARX database, a national, voluntary, Internet-accessible error reporting system, for all error
reports from 1999 through 2004 that involved chemotherapy medications and
patients aged <18 years.

RESULTS. Of the 310 pediatric chemotherapy error reports, 85% reached the
patient, and 15.6% required additional patient monitoring or therapeutic intervention. Forty-eight percent of errors originated in the administering phase of
medication delivery, and 30% originated in the drug-dispensing phase. Of the 387
medications cited, 39.5% were antimetabolites, 14.0% were alkylating agents,
9.3% were anthracyclines, and 9.3% were topoisomerase inhibitors. The most
commonly involved chemotherapeutic agents were methotrexate (15.3%), cytarabine (12.1%), and etoposide (8.3%). The most common error types were improper
dose/quantity (22.9% of 327 cited error types), wrong time (22.6%), omission
error (14.1%), and wrong administration technique/wrong route (12.2%). The
most common error causes were performance deficit (41.3% of 547 cited error
causes), equipment and medication delivery devices (12.4%), communication

(8.8%), knowledge deficit (6.8%), and written order errors (5.5%). Four of the 5
most serious errors occurred at community hospitals.

CONCLUSIONS. Pediatric chemotherapy errors often reached the patient, potentially were harmful, and differed in quality between outpatient and inpatient
areas. This study indicated which chemotherapeutic agents most often were
involved in errors and that administering errors were common. Investigation is

edication errors are common during pediatric hospitalizations,
occurring in nearly 6% of all medication orders for pediatric
inpatients.1,2 The study of these errors remains in its infancy,
because large holes exist in our understanding of which medications
and children are at greatest risk.3,4 To date, pediatric chemotherapy
errors have been examined in only a few studies.5–8 This is humbling to consider in light of reports that 63% of all oncology nurses
have witnessed a chemotherapy medication error.9
The pediatric chemotherapy error literature consists mostly of
case reports.10–13 In 1 comprehensive pediatric oncology medication
error article, it was reported that 13% of incidents reached patients
and that 2% resulted in temporary patient harm requiring medical

intervention. The authors of that article reported 73%
ordering errors, 13% administration errors, 9% preparation errors, and 3% transcription errors. Vincristine,
doxorubicin, and sodium mercaptoehanesulfonate
were the most common medications involved in the
reported errors. The most serious errors involved
dexamethasone and methotrexate.5 A more recent
study that examined the impact of computerized
physician order entry on pediatric chemotherapy
errors found that 2.3% of written pediatric chemotherapy orders in a tertiary care hospital contained
an improper dose, and 5.8% contained an incorrect
dosing calculation. With the institution of a computerized physician order entry system, these rates fell
to 0.06% and 0.54%, respectively.6 The results from 1
outpatient study suggested that pediatric chemotherapy errors occurred in 18.8% of all patients and 9.9%
of all medications prescribed.7 A prospective outpatient chart review identified errors in 3% of all pediatric outpatient chemotherapy orders, with 74% caused
by ordering errors, 23% caused by dispensing errors,
and 3% caused by administering errors.8
More information is needed regarding chemotherapy errors in pediatrics. These medications are
among the most potent medications given to children and have narrow therapeutic windows and
complex ordering requirements.10 In general, medication delivery for children is more complex than for
adults because of necessities such as weight-based
dosages and the availability of liquid oral medications formulated in a variety of concentrations.2,14,15
Chemotherapy medications often heighten this complexity by requiring dosages based on body surface
area.
Working with United States Pharmacopeia (USP),
we performed a quantitative and qualitative analysis
of pediatric chemotherapy medication errors
reported to MEDMARX between January 1, 1999 and
December 31, 2004.16 Our objectives were to identify
patterns in pediatric chemotherapy errors, including
the types of medications involved, the types of errors
created, causes of errors, level of harm of errors,
location of errors, and characteristics of facilities
associated with errors for children.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The USP MEDMARX database is a national, voluntary, Internet-accessible error reporting system that
consisted of 616 subscribing hospitals as of January,
2005. All participating hospitals are in the U.S., and
all 50 states are represented. Each error report is
standardized and provides both the reporting hospital and USP with information regarding the error’s

187

timing, unit location, inpatient versus outpatient
location, phase of care in which the error occurred,
harm caused by the error, cause of error, medication
involved, type of error, and information on the facility in which the error occurred. A recent study of 101
MEDMARX users showed substantial inter-rater
agreement (j 5 .62) for medication error events
using the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention Index for Categorizing Medication Errors.17,18
MEDMARX variables that are unique to error
reporting and that we used in the current analysis
included error category (reflecting the level of patient
harm from error), error node (reflecting the macrolevel cause of error within the entire spectrum of
medication administration, such as prescribing, transcribing, dispensing, or administration), error cause
(reflecting the root cause of the error), and error type
(reflecting the clinical manifestation of what happened regardless of cause). Comprehensive choice
lists for error category, error node, error cause, and
error type are available on request but can be seen
in significant amounts within the presented tables. It
is important to note that some data fields within the
error reports are single pick lists (error category and
error node), and some are multipick lists, allowing
users to enter multiple answers (error cause, error
type, and medications involved). An error that was
classified as outpatient included any patient who
was registered for services but was not admitted.
A key driver for the information reported in the
MEDMARX error reporting system is the error category variable, which describes the degree of harm
the patient experienced as perceived by the reporter.
This categorization is not an ordinal scale. For example, category F errors are different from, but not necessarily ‘‘worse’’ than, category E errors. Category F
errors specifically denote an extended hospitalization
time, whereas category E errors denote an additional
treatment change. These error category harm scores
are the same as those reported by the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and
Prevention Severity Index.18 With increasing error
category harm score, increasingly more data fields
are required to be completed in MEDMARX, such as
patient age. Patient sex is always an optional field. In
addition, from 1999 to 2004, the MEDMARX database
increased its participating institutions from 56 to 616
and went through a number of changes in required
data fields as the concept of error reporting matured.
We queried the MEDMARX database for all error
reports from 1999 to 2004 that involved chemotherapy medications, as defined by our institution, and
that involved patients aged <18 years or patients in

pediatric hospital locations. The list of chemotherapeutic agents was based on Section 10 of the American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information
Reference.19 We grouped ages into infant (age <1
year), preschool (ages 1–4 years), school aged (ages
5–9 years), preadolescent (ages 10–13 years), and adolescent (ages 14–18 years) based on Bright Futures
Guidelines for Health Supervision and Neinstein’s Adolescent Health Care.20,21 For error type, which identifies the action that led to an error, we grouped
response choices for the purposes of our analyses
into categories that involved similar concepts (eg,
deteriorated product and expired product). For error
cause, which describes the root cause of the error, we
grouped the MEDMARX pick list choices into a modified version of the National Coordinating Council for
Medication Error Reporting and Prevention’s error
cause categories.18
For error reports that were logged during 2003
and 2004, we used the simultaneously supplied 2003
and 2004 facility profile data. For error reports that
were logged in between 1999 and 2002, we extrapolated the 2003 facility data to these earlier years. This
was done to enable analysis of the facility characteristics across all years despite differences in the data
collected from 1999 to 2004 under the assumption
that facility characteristics were unlikely to have dramatic shifts in this relatively short time span.
Analyses were done using Minitab software
(release 14).22 The significance of trends across categorical variables was tested with chi-square tests and
STATA 8.0 statistical software, and all tests of statistical significance were 2-sided.23

RESULTS
There were 829,492 errors submitted to USP MEDMARX as of January 1, 2005, and 29,802 of these
errors involved patients aged <18 years. Our query
returned 310 reported pediatric chemotherapy medication errors from January 1, 1999 through December 31, 2004. All age groups were represented well,
and sex was distributed almost equally. In addition,
55.2% of errors occurred in inpatient units, 10%
occurred in outpatient settings, and 34.8% had
unknown locations. Twenty percent of the errors we
identified occurred within pharmacies. From 1999 to
2004, the number of error reports increased in concert with increases in the number of participating
institutions (Table 1). There were no significant
trends observed in the Table 1 data based on reports
in which age, sex, and inpatient/outpatient status
were known or unknown.

The 310 pediatric chemotherapy errors were
reported by 69 separate facilities. Table 2 displays the
characteristics of the facilities that participated in
MEDMARX. Three facilities were no longer participating with USP MEDMARX by 2003; thus, the facility data for their 11 error reports were missing.
University hospitals made up 26.1% of the involved
institutions and reported 40% of the errors. Institutions with from 300 to 599 beds made up 31.9% of
the facilities involved and reported 51% of the errors.
Institutions that delivered 200,000 doses per year
reported 66.1% of the errors, although they made up
only 33.3% of the institutions involved. Chi-square
analysis of these data revealed significant differences

between the data representing a count of facilities
participating in MEDMARX and reporting a chemotherapy error versus the count of error reports by
each type of facility for the following variables: number of beds, number of doses, and inpatient pharmacist. The common theme was that institutions
smaller in size (eg, lower bed count, lower number of
doses dispensed per year, and no 24-hour on-site
pharmacist support) had lower reported error preva-

lence than larger institutions with more beds, greater
pharmacist availability, and higher volumes of drugs
dispensed. For comparative purposes, Table 2 also
summarizes the facility characteristics of all institutions reporting in MEDMARX. It is noteworthy that
the institutions reporting pediatric chemotherapy
errors are more likely to be university institutions or

Table 3 describes the macrolevel characteristics
of these 310 pediatric chemotherapy errors by looking at error category and error node. Overall, 264 of
the reported chemotherapy errors (85%) reached the
patient, and 49 errors (15.6%) created the need for
additional patient monitoring or therapeutic intervention. The most common error node reported was
administering (149 errors) followed by dispensing (94
errors). When examining the 171 inpatient errors versus the 31 outpatient errors, 42% of outpatient errors
were administering errors, 32.3% were dispensing
errors, and 22.6% were prescribing errors, compared
with 50%, 23.4%, and 11.7%, respectively, for inpatient error reports (Table 3).
Overall, there were 387 separate medications
listed in the 310 error reports. The most common
medication classes involved break down as follows:
153 medications (39.5%) were antimetabolites, 54
medications (14.0%) were alkylating agents, 36 medications (9.3%) were anthracyclines, and 36 medications (9.3%) were topoisomerase inhibitors. The most
commonly involved chemotherapeutic agents were
methotrexate (59 errors; 15.3% of 387 medications
reported), cytarabine (47 errors; 12.1%), etoposide
(32 errors; 8.3%), and doxorubicin (24 errors; 6.2%).
The majority of error reports (81.3%) mentioned only
1 chemotherapy medication involved in the error

(Table 4). There were 203 separate medications
involved in the 171 inpatient error reports, and the
most common medications were methotrexate
(16.7% of 203 medications reported), cytarabine
(15.3%), doxorubicin (6.9%), cyclophosphamide
(6.4%), and etoposide (6.4%). There were 44 separate
medications involved in 31 outpatient error reports.
The most common outpatient medications involved
were methotrexate (20.5% of 44 medications
reported), tretinoin (15.9%), vincristine (11.4%),
asparginase (6.8%), and cyclophosphamide (6.8%).
For the tretinoin citations, 8 of the 11 total citations
appeared to be for topical creams. Chi-square analysis of medications with >10 total citations revealed
significant differences between lists of medications
involved in inpatient versus outpatient settings (Table 4).
Within the 310 error reports, there were 324 error
types cited and 3 error reports with no error type
identified. The most common error types were
improper dose/quantity (75 citations; 22.9% of 327
possible error types), wrong time (74 citations;
22.6%), omission error (46 citations; 14.1%), and
wrong administration technique/wrong route (40
citations; 12.2%). The majority of error reports
(n 5 292) cited only 1 error type, 13 reports cited 2
error types, and 2 reports cited 3 error types.
Because wrong time error types were cited more often in this data set than in previously published
MEDMARX datasets, we cross tabulated these error
reports with error category.24,25 Seventy-two wrong

medication delivery devices (68 citations; 12.4%),
communication (48 citations; 8.8%), knowledge deficit (37 citations; 6.8%), and written order errors (30
citations; 5.5%). One hundred eighty-nine error
reports cited 1 error cause, 58 reports cited 2 error
causes, 27 reports cited 3 error causes, and 33 reports
cited 4 error causes. Using the broadest categories
from the National Coordinating Council for Medication Error Reporting and Prevention, the 2 most common error cause groups were human factors (368
errors; 67%) and miscommunication (78 errors;
14%).18 The causes of outpatient errors were more
likely to be classified as equipment and medication
delivery devices (17.0% vs 10.5%), were more likely to
be classified as brand name similarities and stress/
high workload (5.7% and 1.9%, respectively vs. 0%),
were less likely to be classified as knowledge deficit
(3.8% vs 8.8%), and were less likely to be classified as
drug preparation errors (0% vs 3.4%) (Table 5).
There were 5 errors that resulted in individual
harm and required treatment or prolonged hospitalization (error categories E-I) (Table 6). Of these errors,
only 1, which involved bleomycin, occurred in a
facility that did not have a pharmacist on site
24 hours a day. In general, only 2 of the 5 high harm
errors involved a chemotherapy-specific issue,
namely, improper calculation of an absolute neutrophil count and a delay caused by an insufficient
quantity of methotrexate available. The other 3 high
harm errors involved issues that are generic to all
medication errors, such as reversing infusion rates
between 2 infusions, a delay in medication delivery,
and switching of patient labels for the same medication. Four of the 5 most serious errors occurred at
community hospitals.

DISCUSSION
time errors (97%) reached the patient, and 7 wrong
time errors (9.5%) created the need for additional
patient monitoring or therapeutic intervention, suggesting that wrong time errors were less likely to
harm a patient than other errors in our dataset. Outpatient error types were nearly twice as likely to be
classified as prescribing errors (17.6% vs 9.4%), were
more likely to be classified as improper dose/quantity (26.5% vs 18.9%), and were less likely to be classified as omission errors (11.8% vs 16.1%) (Table 5).
There were 542 error causes cited and 5 error
reports with no error cause cited. The most common
error causes were performance deficit (226 citations;
41.3% of 547 possible error causes), equipment and

that represents 69 facilities across the nation. It is
noteworthy that 85% of the errors we identified did
reach the patient. Despite the large focus nationally
on computerized ordering systems to fix medication
prescribing errors, 48% of the chemotherapy errors
we studied were caused by administering mistakes.
In terms of the chemotherapeutic agents, 39%
involved antimetabolite drugs, and 15% involved
methotrexate. The multicausal nature of medication
errors is reflected in our data, because the number of
reported error causes is large. Outpatient chemotherapy errors were more likely to involve dispensing

mistakes, prescribing mistakes, and equipment failures. There was also a clear trend toward more error
reports in larger institutions. We have no reason to
believe these data are indicative of larger institutions
simply making more errors, as opposed to the simple
fact of greater volumes of oncology patients and
more internal resources devoted to quality and error
reporting.
Differences between the current study and prior
pediatric chemotherapy error investigations may be
because of the anonymous nature of the MEDMARX
error reporting system; the increasing presence of
computerized physician ordering systems, which
decrease prescribing errors; and innate differences
between tertiary care hospitals, in which all prior
studies were conducted, and community hospitals,
in which 46% of our error reports were generated.5–8
More research is needed to examine these differences.

These data suggest clear areas for intensive
patient safety research and development of targeted
interventions to improve the safe delivery of pediatric chemotherapy medications. First, a renewed focus
on issues and barriers to correct medication administration should be explored. The national focus on
computerized order entry does not ameliorate the
likelihood of administering errors anywhere to the
same degree that it does for prescribing errors.
Related to this, many vendor-supplied, computerized, order-entry systems are weakest in their ability
to handle the prescribing and electronic Medication
Administration Record posting of chemotherapy
agents as opposed to other medications; and their
use in pediatrics has been brought into question by
a recent, albeit controversial, study.26 Interventions
such as Health Care Failure Mode and Effect Analysis
have been proven useful in the pediatric oncology
setting.6,27 For maximal effectiveness, a collaborative

Health Care Failure Mode and Effect Analysis
between multiple institutions could create a forum
for discussion of best practices among pediatric oncology centers. Such an effort likely would identify
fruitful areas for targeted safety work in areas as relatively simple as standardizing the logic and order of
protocols and nomenclature used (eg, is the first day
of a chemotherapy protocol Day 0 or Day 1?). In
addition, point-of-care bar coding interventions have
shown promise at preventing administration type
errors and could be applied in pediatric chemotherapy situations, although the recent Institute of
Medicine report, Preventing Medication Errors,
acknowledges that there is currently very limited evidence on the efficacy of bar coding for medication
error prevention.28–30
Second, a discussion of the different chemotherapy error types and error causes that occur in outpatient versus inpatient settings needs to be translated
into different safety systems tailored for each of these
settings. Third, increased communication between
adult and pediatric chemotherapy delivery systems
could prevent similar errors from occurring. It is
likely that the adult oncology community, with its
greater patient volume, has determined some best
practices that could be translated and disseminated
in the pediatric oncology arena. Supporting this idea,
prior studies utilizing adult MEDMARX data have
produced results similar to those from pediatric
MEDMARX studies.24,25,31,32 Based on this, we speculate that, although significant differences exist
between adult and pediatric chemotherapy delivery,
common themes may be found to decrease errors
across both patient populations.
The USP MEDMARX database does involve a
number of limitations.24,25,31,32 First, all data are
reported voluntarily and, thus, do not convey a representative picture of all errors and are not suitable
for determining national error rates because of the
lack of a ‘‘denominator.’’ The anonymous nature of
the data also precludes the identification of geographic trends. The distribution of facilities indicates
that the MEDMARX database consists mainly of general community hospitals, although our error reports
had a greater tendency to be generated at university
hospitals. It is unclear how this distribution of hospitals affected the data collected and how representative these facilities are of all pediatric chemotherapy
centers in the U.S. Furthermore, despite evidence of
substantial interrater agreement, MEDMARX users
may have varied impressions of errors and their categories.17 Nevertheless, error report data may be one
of the most robust ways to obtain snapshots of errors
that are useful for identifying trends and issues.33

Second, the vast majority of error reports are generated by nurses and pharmacists.34 It appears logical
that nurses would be positioned the best to identify
errors, because they are the last link in the chain of
medication delivery. It is unclear, however, the extent
to which their perspectives bias the data or provide
the best vantage point from which to observe the
entire spectrum of the medication use process. Collectively, an accurate picture of the scope of medication errors needs both chart reviews and error
reporting to robustly capture medication errors from
all possible phases.8 For the patient, errors at any
step in the medication process are significant and
need to be understood and addressed. Third, because
of the changing requirements of the USP MEDMARX
system, errors from different years have different
data fields completed. In addition, this temporal
issue in the data also most likely is effected by the
2000 Institute of Medicine’s report To Err is Human.35
Finally, not all of the medications in our query are
used solely to treat oncologic problems, which is
clear by the multiple citations of tretinoin topical
creams.
In conclusion, for this study, we examined 310
pediatric chemotherapy medication errors that were
collected through a national, voluntary error reporting database. These errors often reached the patient,
were potentially harmful to the pediatric patient
population, and differed in quality between outpatient and inpatient oncology areas. Commonly used
chemotherapeutics, such as methotrexate and cytarabine, frequently were involved, and medication
administration was cited as the macrolevel cause in
nearly half of the errors. Pediatric hospitals and
future quality improvement research should target
medication administration safeguards for these highrisk medications and should consider different and
specific solutions for inpatient and outpatient pediatric oncology units, respectively.
