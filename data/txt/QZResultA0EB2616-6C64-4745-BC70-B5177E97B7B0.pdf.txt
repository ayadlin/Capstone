Abstract
Gold(III) complexes have shown promise as antitumor agents, but their clinical usefulness has been limited
by their poor stability under physiological conditions. A novel gold(III) porphyrin complex [5-hydroxyphenyl10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinato gold(III) chloride (gold-2a)] with improved aqueous stability showed 100-fold
to 3,000-fold higher cytotoxicity than platinum-based cisplatin and IC50 values in the nanomolar range in a
panel of human breast cancer cell lines. Intraductal injections of gold-2a significantly suppressed mammary
tumor growth in nude mice. These effects are attributed, in part, to attenuation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling
through inhibition of class I histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity. These data, in combination with computer
modeling, suggest that gold-2a may represent a promising class of anticancer HDAC inhibitor preferentially
targeting tumor cells with aberrant Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Cancer Res; 70(1); 329–37. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Breast cancer represents the most common diagnosed female malignancy and the second leading cause of women
death worldwide (1). Chemotherapeutic agents are commonly used and usually given in the form of combinational chemotherapy (2). However, the effects of these agents are not
universal, and a large portion of patients will develop resistance. Moreover, side effects including induction of lifethreatening toxicity are commonly encountered.
Therapeutic values of gold have been recognized thousands
of years ago, and its rational use in medicine began in early
1920s (3–7). Because gold(III) is isoelectronic with platinum
(II) and tetracoordinate gold(III) complexes are in the same
square-planar geometries as cisplatin, the potential anticancer properties of gold(III) complexes have been investigated
for almost three decades (8, 9). A number of gold(III) complexes have been reported to exhibit cytotoxicities against a
broad spectrum of tumor cells, and their potencies (IC50 values
in low micromolar range) are comparable with that of cisplatin. In contrast to general expectations, evidence suggest that

the gold(III) complexes exert their antiproliferative activities
through mechanisms that are substantially different from
those of platinum drugs (10). Yet, the molecular mechanisms
and targets of gold(III)-based antitumor metallodrugs remain
largely uncharacterized.
Previously we synthesized a series of gold(III) meso-tetraarylporphyrin complexes characterized by enhanced stability
in aqueous solutions and under physiological conditions (11).
Among them, gold-1a [5,10,15,20-tetraphenylporphyrinato
gold(III) chloride] showed promising antiproliferative activities against human cancer cells, including those derived from
neuroblastoma, colon, nasopharyngeal, and hepatocellular
carcinomas (11–15). In the present study, a novel gold(III)
porphyrin analogue [5-hydroxyphenyl-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrinato gold(III) chloride (gold-2a)] was prepared by modifying one of the peripheral phenyl groups of the gold-1a with
a hydroxyl substitution to improve its aqueous solubility
(Supplementary Fig. S1). The efficacy of gold-2a in suppressing the growth of a panel of human breast cancer cells was
evaluated in vitro, and its anticancer activity was investigated
in nude mice. Our results suggest that gold-2a is a promising
drug lead for anti–breast cancer treatment and that it can
selectively inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling through modulating histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of gold(III) porphyrin complex (gold-2a).
The synthesis of the gold(III) porphyrin complex (gold-2a)
was conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere using the standard Schlenk technique (11). 1H nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectrum was recorded on a DPX-400 Bruker FTNMR spectrometer with chemical shift (in ppm) relative to
tetramethylsilane. Absorption spectrum was recorded on a
Perkin-Elmer Lambda 900 UV-vis spectrophotometer. Mass
spectrum (FAB) was recorded on a Finnigan MAT95 mass

H, 3.17; N, 6.46. For cell culture and other in vitro experiments, gold-2a and cisplatin were dissolved in DMSO,
whereas for in vivo animal administration, these complexes
were dissolved in PET (a mixture of 60% polyethylene glycol,
30% ethanol, and 10% Tween-80) and further diluted with
PBS at a 1:9 ratio.
Cell proliferation measurement. Cell proliferation was
evaluated by crystal violet staining and [3H]thymidine incorporation methods as described previously (16, 17). The human
breast carcinoma BT474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, SKBR3, T47D
cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection on December 2004. The identities of these cells were confirmed by STR-profiling using the Cell ID System from
Promega (last tested on 16/02/09).
Inoculation of breast cancer cells into nude mice and
drug treatment. MDA-MB-231 cells (5 × 106) were implanted
into the third right thoracic mammary fat pad of female nude
mice (6 wk old) as described before (17). Six days after the
implantation, the mice were divided into groups consisting
of animals bearing almost the same size of tumor. Intraductal administration of the drugs was performed at the 7th and
11th days after initial implantation (day 0). I.p. drug administration was performed twice weekly as indicated. Tumor
development was monitored every 3 to 4 d using digital vernier calipers, with tumor volume calculated using the formula
[sagittal dimension (mm) × cross-dimension (mm)]2 / 2 and
expressed in mm3. All animal experimental protocols were
approved by the animal ethics committee at the University
of Hong Kong.
β-Catenin/T-cell factor-lymphoid enhancer factor-1
transcription reporter assay. Nuclear activities of endogenous β-catenin were analyzed by TOPflash/FOPflash reporter system (17).
Quantitative reverse transcription–PCR and chromatin
immunoprecipitation–PCR. Quantitative reverse transcription–
PCR (RT-PCR) was performed as described (17). The primers
were listed in Supplementary Table S1. The histone acetylation at the promoter regions of different genes was compared
by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)–PCR and ChIPQPCR. Briefly, 8 × 106 tumor cells were cross-linked with 1%
formaldehyde and sheared by sonication to obtain chromatin with an average DNA length of 500 to 1,000 bp. After a
3-h preclear with protein G–Sepharose beads (blocked with
0.2 mg/mL salmon sperm DNA and 0.5 mg/mL bovine
serum albumin), 100 μg chromatin were incubated with
2 μg of antibodies at 4°C overnight. Immunocomplexes were
collected by protein G–Sepharose (blocked as above),
washed, and eluted in 50-μL elution buffer (0.1 mol/L NaHCO3, 1% SDS). After reversed cross-linking, the chromatin

fragments were purified by phenol-chloroform extraction.
PCR amplifications were performed using 10% of the DNA
samples, and the resulting products were quantified by densitometry (MultiAnalyst Software, Bio-Rad). The primers
were listed in Supplementary Table S2. Quantitation was also performed using real-time PCR analysis.
HDAC activity assay. HDAC activity was determined using the colorimetric HDAC activity assay kit (BioVision,
Inc.) and the Fluor de Lys Substrate (BML-AK500, BIOMOL
International) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, for in vitro HDAC activity determination, 150 μg
of MDA-MB-231 nuclear extracts were incubated with
different dosages of gold-2a for various periods of time.
The reaction was initiated by addition of HDAC colorimetric substrate and incubation at 37°C for 1 h. The developer
was then added, and the samples were incubated at 37°C
for another 30 min before reading at 405 nm. Cells pretreated with drug compounds were also processed for
HDAC activity measurement. In addition, the inhibitory effects of gold-2a on individual HDACs were tested using
immunoprecipitated complexes.
Histone acetylation analysis. Histones were extracted
according to the procedure reported previously (18). The
acid soluble histone fraction was subjected to 18% SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting analysis.
Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry analysis. Subcellular fractionation was performed as described
(19). Nuclear fractions were further separated into nuclear
matrix, nucleoid, and nucleolus. All samples were subjected
to inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS)
analysis (7500 series, Agilent Technologies, Inc.) for determining the content of the stable gold isotope 197Au (20).
Molecular docking. The 1.9-Å X-ray structure of HDAC8
(Protein Data Bank code 1t64) was used for docking calculations using Gaussian 03. The gold-2a complex was optimized
using DFT with a LanL2MB basis set (21). ICM-Pro 3.6-1 program (Molsoft) was applied for molecular docking. Energy calculations were based on the ECEPP/3 force field with a
distance-dependent dielectric constant (22). The biased probability Monte Carlo minimization procedure was used for global
energy optimization. All ICM dockings were performed thrice,
and a minimum of the three interaction energies was used.
Data analysis and statistics. All experiments were performed with three to eight samples per group, and all results
were derived from at least three independent experiments.
Data are shown as mean values ± SD. Unless otherwise specified, comparison between groups was done using Student's t
test. P < 0.05 was used to indicate a significant difference.

Results
Gold-2a exerts potent antiproliferative activities against
human breast cancer cells. Five types of human breast carcinoma cells with distinct gene expression profiles and oncogenic
phenotypes, including BT474, MCF-7, T47D, MDA-MB-231, and
SKBR3 (23), were used for evaluating the cytotoxicity of gold-2a.
Crystal violet assay showed that gold-2a inhibited growth of all
five types of cells at mean IC50 values of 0.49 ± 0.17, 0.08 ± 0.04,

[0.5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) condition, 24-hour treatment;
Table 1]. The presence of high concentrations of serum had
no effects on the potencies of the drug. In contrast, the IC50
values of cisplatin were ∼100 to 3,000 times higher than
gold-2a. Similar results were observed when the drug exposure time was extended to 48 hours. It should be noted that
the IC 50 values of gold-2a were one to two logs lower in
MDA-MB-231 cells than the other four types of cells under
all conditions. On the other hand, the potency of gold-2a
toward noncancerous fibroblast cell was ∼10-fold to 600-fold
lower than those of mammary cancer cells with an IC50 of
4.17 ± 1.67 μmol/L. The antiproliferative activity of another
gold(III) porphyrin complex {[Au III (TPP)]Cl, gold-1a} in
MDA-MB-231 cells was also tested. Nonlinear regression analysis of the growth inhibition curves revealed that gold-1a was
∼450-fold less effective than gold-2a (IC50, 1.351 ± 0.032 μmol/L
versus 0.003 ± 0.008 μmol/L). Apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 cells
were evaluated by measuring DNA fragmentation and terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
analysis. The results showed that gold-2a significantly increased
DNA fragmentation and the number of apoptotic cells in a
dose- and time-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Intraductal delivery of gold-2a effectively attenuates
mammary MDA-MB-231 tumor growth in nude mice. To
evaluate the in vivo antitumor effects of gold-2a, MDA-MB231 cells were implanted into athymic nude mice and different drug dosages were tested for the treatment. Biweekly i.p.
administration of gold-2a (1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg) for up to
4 weeks dose-dependently attenuated the tumor growth
(Supplementary Fig. S3). However, no complete tumor suppression could be achieved despite the fact that the animals
tolerated the treatment well. Instead, the administration of
two bolus of the gold-2a (15 mg/kg) by intraductal injection
into tumor xenograft resulted in a complete tumor remission
in 50% of the animals at 2 weeks after initial implantation
(Fig. 1A). Most of the animals remained in a tumor-free status
until day 25, at which recurrence of tumor was observed. Comparing to gold-2a, intraductal delivery of the same dosage of
cisplatin attenuated the rates of tumor growth to a much less
degree. Of note is that ∼40% of animals died in the cisplatin
treatment group after two injections, whereas those of the PET

control and gold-2a treatment groups remained alive during
the experimental periods (Fig. 1B). The body weights of both
gold-2a– and cisplatin-treated mice were slightly lower than
the PET control group (Fig. 1C). The average tumor weights
in gold-2a and cisplatin groups were 0.17 ± 0.02 and 0.42 ±
0.15 g, respectively, which were decreased by 73% and 34%
when compared with control group (Fig. 1D).
Gold-2a inactivates Wnt/β-catenin signaling in MDAMB-231 cells through transcriptional regulation. Aberrant
activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling and intracellular
accumulation of β-catenin protein have been observed in a
large portion of human breast tumors (24, 25). Gold-2a decreased the protein levels of β-catenin in MDA-MB-231 cells
as early as 4 hours after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Nuclear transcriptional activities of β-catenin were also dramatically reduced by gold-2a (Supplementary Fig. S4B). On
the contrary, cisplatin had no influence on both the protein
levels and nuclear activities of β-catenin. In the absence of a
Wnt signal, β-catenin is phosphorylated by glycogen
synthase kinase-3β, which facilitates the subsequent ubiquintination and proteasome degradation. However, gold2a treatment did not alter the relative phosphorylation or
ubiquintination levels of β-catenin and had no obvious effects on proteasome activities (Supplementary Fig. S5). In
the mean time, decreased phosphorylations of Akt and
GSK-3β were observed from 6 hours onward after gold-2a
treatment, later than the effects on β-catenin protein levels
(Supplementary Fig. S4A). To address the cytotoxic mechanisms of gold-2a, ICP-MS was performed for monitoring the
intracellular localization of this complex. The results showed
that gold-2a rapidly (within 30 min) entered the nuclei of
MDA-MB-231 cells and was enriched in the nucleoid fractions (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
The drop in intracellular levels of β-catenin can be triggered by a loss of Wnt signal–induced stabilization (26). In
fact, quantitative PCR analysis revealed that gold-2a treatment time- and dose-dependently altered the mRNA expressions of several Wnt signaling molecules, including
WNT1, WNT5B, WIF1, WISP1, and CTNNB1 (Fig. 2). For instance, gold-2a treatment largely blocked the expression of
WNT1 but profoundly augmented the mRNA levels of
WIF1. Significant upregulation of WIF1 (over 80-fold) was

observed at as early as 2 hours, and the stimulatory effects
continued during the 24-hour course of treatment. The
mRNA levels of WISP1 were rapidly decreased to an undetectable level after gold-2a treatment. The significant effects of gold-2a on CTNNB1 and WNT5B expression were
observed from 6 hours of treatment onward. Similar trends
of changes were also shown for the protein expressions of
WNT1, WNT5B, WIF1, and WISP1 (Fig. 2). These results
indicated that gold-2a might elicit its antiproliferative effects through regulating the gene transcriptions of Wnt/
β-catenin signaling molecules.
Gold-2a acts as a selective HDAC inhibitor to regulate
histone acetylation at the promoter regions of genes
involved in Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The above results
showed that gold-2a could selectively enhance the gene expression of WIF1 and noncanonical WNT5B but inhibit those
of WNT1, CTNNB1, and WISP1. Epigenetic regulations, such as
DNA methylation and histone acetylation, represent important mechanisms for the aberrant activation of Wnt signaling
during cancer development. The results in Fig. 3 showed that
gold-2a exhibited potent inhibitory effects on the enzyme activities of HDAC, the dynamic transcriptional regulator for
deacetylating chromatin histones. Treatment with gold-2a resulted in a rapid decrease of the HDAC activities in MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 3A). The inhibitory effects could also be observed
by coincubation of gold-2a with the nuclear extracts derived
from untreated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3B). The HDAC inhibition was proportional to the incubation time, and the potency of gold-2a was comparable with that of trichostatin A (TSA),
a specific inhibitor for multiple HDACs (27, 28). To test whether gold-2a could act as a preferential inhibitor, individual

HDAC (HDAC1–HDAC9) was immunoprecipitated from the
MDA-MB-231 cells and incubated with gold-2a, which was
found to be able to inhibit the activity of all class I HDACs,
including HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, and HDAC8 (Fig. 3C).
To further confirm these unexpected observations, ChIP-PCR
was performed to quantify the acetylated histone H4 levels at
the promoter regions of the above genes. As the results shown
in Fig. 4, treatment with gold-2a enhanced the binding of acetylated histone H4 to WIF1 and WNT5B promoters. In contrast, a
decrease in acetylated histone H4 was observed at WNT1 promoter after gold-2a treatment. TSA had no significant effects on
these three genes but increased acetylated histone H4 binding
to the promoter of estrogen receptor α (ESR1). The acetylated
histone H4 binding to the promoter of β-catenin gene
(CTNNB1) and WISP1 was not significantly altered by gold-2a
or TSA treatment. Western blotting analysis showed significant
induction of histone H4 acetylation by TSA, which occurred as
early as 6 hours after treatment (Fig. 4). Gold-2a was less effective on global histone H4 acetylation. Similar levels of acetylated
histone H4 were only observed at 24 hours after treatment.
Among the four members of class I HDACs, HDAC2 could
not be detected at the promoters of all five Wnt pathway
genes, despite that it was present at the promoter of ESR1.
The abundance of HDAC1, HDAC3, and HDAC8 was highly
variable at the promoter regions of these genes (Fig. 5).
HDAC1 was more abundantly associated with WNT5B than
other promoters. HDAC3 was not associated with WNT5B
promoter. The amounts of HDAC3 and HDAC8 at WIF1 promoter were much higher than the other four genes. The highest and lowest association could differ by as much as 10,000
times. With this information, the significant fold increases

that were below 10 may not be biologically important. Gold2a, to a greater extent, elicited inhibitory effects on the associations of different HDACs to the promoters of WIF1, WNT1,
WNT5B, and CTNNB1 (Fig. 5). In samples treated with 1
μmol/L gold-2a, HDAC1 at the promoters of WIF1 and
WNT5B was dramatically decreased by 54- and 164-fold, respectively; HDAC3 at the promoters of WIF1, WNT1, and
CTNNB1 was downregulated by 193-, 23-, and 162-fold, respectively; the binding of HDAC8 to WIF1 promoter was also
found to be downregulated by ∼300-fold.
To understand how gold-2a interacts with class I HDAC,
molecular docking studies were performed using flexibleligand docking module of ICM-Pro 3.6-1 based on the
known X-ray crystal structures of HDAC8 (Supplementary
Fig. S6). As a reference, TSA showed an interaction energy
of −10.28 kcal/mol (Supplementary Fig. S6A and C). The
root mean square deviation was within 1.0 Å when compared with the X-ray crystal structure of HDAC8-TSA
(PDB code: 1T64). Comparative analysis of the low-energy
conformations suggested a strong interaction between
gold-2a and the binding pocket at the surface of HDAC8
(binding energy of −9.67 kcal/mol; Supplementary Fig. S6B
and D). Unlike the binding modes of TSA, the side chains of
gold-2a are not buried inside the 11-Å channel. The porphyrin rings are filled into the hydrophobic pocket and in close
contact (within 4 Å) with amino acid residues Tyr100,
Phe152, Gly151, His180, Met274, and Pro273. The OH group
of gold-2a points toward the 14-Å internal cavity of HDAC8,
which blocks the exit of the 14-Å internal cavity of HDAC8.

Discussion
The presence of nuclear β-catenin in a broad spectrum
of human cancers makes Wnt/β-catenin pathway an attractive target for cancer treatment. Nevertheless, the development of such therapeutics is still in its infancy, with no
options currently undergoing late-stage clinical trials (29). In
breast cancer, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is mostly deregulated by loss of negative Wnt signaling regulators through epigenetic silencing (30). For example, the Wnt antagonists, such
as WIF1 and secreted frizzled-related protein 1 (sFRP1), are inactivated due to promoter hypermethylation (31, 32). The
present study showed that the drug complex gold-2a decreased the protein and mRNA levels of β-catenin and
inhibited its nuclear transcriptional activities. Whereas the
expression of sFRP1 was extremely low and could not be upregulated by gold-2a, the mRNA levels of WIF1 were rapidly
and dramatically augmented upon drug treatment. On the
other hand, the expressions of WNT1, CTNNB1, and WISP1
were abolished by gold-2a. These effects are attributed, at
least partly, to the inhibitory actions of gold-2a on class I
HDAC activities, which differentially regulate the histone
acetylation at the gene promoters of these Wnt signaling
molecules. The effects of gold-2a on gene transcription are
consistent with its rapid entry into the cell nuclei.
Histone acetylation and deacetylation play fundamental
roles in modulating chromatin topology and gene transcription (33). Deacetylation is a process mediated by
HDACs, which remove acetyl group from the histone tails,

and CTNNB1 was normalized against

causing the histones to wrap more tightly around the DNA
and interfere with gene transcriptions. HDACs are often
overexpressed in tumors compared with surrounding normal tissue and correlated with poor prognosis and survival
rate (34). HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) are a promising new
class of anticancer agents that can inhibit proliferation
and induce differentiation and/or apoptosis of tumor cells,
with little toxicity to normal cells (35, 36). Several HDACis
are currently in phases I and II clinical trials on hematologic and solid malignancies (37–39). Results in the present
study suggested gold-2a to be a potential HDACi. It dose-

and time-dependently inhibited the HDAC activities in
both cell cultures and isolated nuclear extracts and also
regulated the global histone acetylation levels, despite of
a lower efficiency than TSA. Although the overall result
of deacetylation is a global (nonspecific) reduction in gene
expression, it has been found that HDACi can selectively
modulate a certain set of genes (36, 40). Here, the results
showed that gold-2a regulated promoter histone acetylation in a different manner from that of TSA. Gold-2a
was more effective on Wnt/β-catenin signaling genes but
had less effect on ESR1. Although the detailed mechanisms

Anti–Breast Cancer Activity of Gold-2a

underlying the HDACi effects of gold-2a were not fully addressed in the present study, experiments using individual immunoprecipitated HDAC complexes revealed that
this drug complex might act as a preferential inhibitor
for class I HDACs. The proposed mechanism of gold-2a
as a class I HDACi was further supported by molecular
modeling of the binding interactions with HDAC8 (with
favorable calculated binding energy of −9.67 kcal/mol).
Although the three-dimensional structures of all HDACs
have not been fully resolved, the available evidence suggest that the hydrophobic pockets on their surface near
the exit of the 14-Å channel show the most flexibility
comparing with other regions (41). Gold-2a occupies almost all pockets of HDAC8 and blocks the entry of the
11-Å channel and the exit of the 14-Å internal cavity. On
the other hand, TSA interacts with only one of these
pockets. The bulk structure of gold-2a may allow stronger but more selective interactions with certain types of

HDACs. Our unpublished data suggested that gold-2a
may share similar mechanisms with cyclic tetrapeptide,
a distinct class of HDACi (42).
Comparing with cisplatin, which had no effect on both
protein stabilities and nuclear activities of β-catenin, gold-2a
showed more potent cytotoxic effects in cell culture and better
anticancer activities in nude mice with less systematic toxicity.
The antiproliferative activities of gold-2a in MDA-MB-231 cells
were comparable with other HDACi, such as SAHA (43) and
TSA (44). Previous studies have suggested that cisplatin and
gold (III) porphyrin complexes elicit their anticancer effects
through distinct mechanisms at the DNA level and the protein
level, respectively (45–48). Among the five types of human
breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 possesses the most active
autocrine canonical Wnt signaling, followed by SKBR3,
T47D, MCF-7, and BT474 (16, 49), indicating that gold-2a
may favor on targeting cancers that are more addicted to
Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We have previously reported that

Figure 4. Gold-2a modulates the acetylation status of histone H4 at the promoter regions of Wnt signaling molecules. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated
with different drugs for 24 h. ChIP-PCR was performed for analyzing the levels of acetylated histone H4 at the promoter regions of CTNNB1, WIF1,
WNT5B, WNT1, WISP1, and ESR1 (active gene control), using antibody recognizing histone H4 acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16. Bar charts represent
the quantitative results by real-time PCR analysis after normalization against the input DNA. Representative agarose gel images are shown at the
bottom. Western blotting was performed for analyzing the global acetylated histone H4 (Ace-H4) levels in MDA-MB-231 cells treated with TSA or gold-2a
for 6 and 24 h, respectively. Equal protein loading was confirmed by Ponceau S staining. *, P < 0.01 versus vehicle control (n = 3).

Figure 5. Gold-2a differentially
regulates the associations of
class I HDACs to the promoter
regions of the five Wnt signaling
molecules. ChIP-PCR was
performed using MDA-MB-231
cells that had been treated with or
without drug compounds at the
indicated concentrations for 24 h.
The associations of HDAC1 (A),
HDAC3 (B), and HDAC8 (C) were
quantified by real-time PCR
analysis. Left, the amount of each
HDAC bound to the promoter
regions of individual gene was
compared and calculated as fold
change versus WIF1 to reflect their
relative abundances. The y axis
is at logarithmic scale. Right, the
associations of HDAC1, HDAC3,
or HDAC8 to the promoters of
WIF1, WNT1, WNT5B, CTNNB1,
and WISP1 were quantified and
calculated against vehicle control
samples. *, P < 0.01 (n = 3).

gold(III) porphyrin 1a (gold-1a) can induce apoptosis through
both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mitochondrial pathways (14). The results from the present study suggest
that the two compounds, although possessing similar chemical structures, might not share common cytotoxic mechanisms at the molecular level. The difference between gold-1a
and gold-2a is the replacement of a benzene group by a phenol
group. Subha and colleagues have reported that the presence
of hydroxyl groups on test inhibitor compounds can favor the
fitting into the active site of HDAC (50). It remains to be addressed whether the presence of a hydroxyl group in gold-2a
assists this compound in targeting HDACs and whether the
presence of more hydroxyl groups at the side arms of these
gold(III) porphyrins contributes to higher toxicity or more potent inhibition toward HDACs. Further investigations are currently being carried out in our laboratory for elucidating the
detailed mechanisms contributing to the selective inhibitory
activities of gold-2a on HDACs.
