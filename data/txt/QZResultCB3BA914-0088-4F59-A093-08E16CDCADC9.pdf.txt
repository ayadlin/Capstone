Abstract
Recent efforts to sequence human cancer genomes have
highlighted that point mutations in genes involved in the epigenetic setting occur in tumor cells. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is
an aggressive tumor with poor prognosis, where little is known
about the genetic events related to its development. Herein, we
have identiﬁed the presence of homozygous deletions of the
candidate histone acetyltransferase KAT6B, and the loss of the

corresponding transcript, in SCLC cell lines and primary tumors.
Furthermore, we show, in vitro and in vivo, that the depletion of
KAT6B expression enhances cancer growth, while its restoration
induces tumor suppressor–like features. Most importantly, we
demonstrate that KAT6B exerts its tumor-inhibitory role through a
newly deﬁned type of histone H3 Lys23 acetyltransferase activity.

Introduction

metastases, and premature death (1). Although SCLC patients
demonstrate many times a complete initial response to chemotherapy, the tumor almost always returns probably due to the
original presence of quiescent cells. If the total cancer volume is
irradiated, survival of SCLC patients is improved. Importantly, we
have poor second-line therapies especially when the cancer comes
back quickly after ﬁrst-line therapy is completed. In this regard, no
new biologically targeted therapeutics have shown activity in this
tumor type (2). Comprehensive genomic analyses have revealed
genetically altered therapeutic targets in non–small cell lung
carcinoma (3), but little is known about the genetic events
involved in SCLC beyond the long-recognized high rate of TP53
and RB1 mutations (1). Molecular studies in SCLC have been
hampered because these tumors are rarely resected, resulting in a
lack of suitable tumor specimens. However, point mutations in
genes encoding histone modiﬁers in SCLC have recently been
described (4). In this regard, disruption of the histone modiﬁcation landscape is a common event in cancer cells (5, 6), leading to
signiﬁcant changes in chromatin structure and gene expression
affecting oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (7, 8). In this
context, much effort has been devoted to analyzing the exomes of
histone modiﬁers in search of small nucleotide changes, but
cancer-speciﬁc copy-number changes have not been particularly
studied in profound detail. To address this issue, we have examined the existence of this type of gross genomic alteration for
histone modiﬁers in SCLC that can functionally contribute to the
tumoral phenotype and that are of translational relevance.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for about 15% of all
lung cancers and is characterized by accelerated growth, frequent

H1672, and NCI-H2029), from the Leibniz Institute DSMZ (Jena,
Germany)-German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (HCC-33), and from Sigma-Aldrich (DMS-273). All cell
lines were characterized by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis
proﬁling (LGS Standards SLU) within 6 months after receipt. DNA
samples from primary and metastatic tumors of SCLC patients
were obtained at surgery or autopsy from 1985 to 2010 at the
National Cancer Center Hospital/National Cancer Center Biobank (Tokyo, Japan), Saitama Medical University (Saitama,
Japan), and University of Tsukuba (Ibaraki, Japan). The study
was approved by the corresponding Institutional Review Boards.
Genotyping microarrays and MLPA analysis
Illumina HumanOmni5-Quad (v1) genotyping array was processed as previously described (9). For multiplex ligation-dependent probe ampliﬁcation (MLPA), genomic DNA was subjected to
SALSA probemixes containing probes for the KAT6B gene, in
addition to 21 reference probes, and the analyses were performed
using Coffalyser.net software (MRC-Holland).
FISH analysis
The UCSC genome browser was used to select the 10q22.2
region probe for KAT6B detection (RP11-668A2), and the telomeric probe in 10p15.3 (RP11-361E18) was used as a control.
Bacterial artiﬁcial chromosome (BAC) clones were obtained
from the BACPAC Resource at the Children's Hospital Oakland
Research Institute (Oakland, CA). Probes were labeled with
Spectrum Green and Red dUTP (Abbott).
Quantitative genomic PCR
The deletion frequency of KAT6B (evaluated by SYBR Green)
was calculated by the standard curve method using the 7900HT
SDS program. Results are reported as the n-fold copy number
increase relative to the KAT6B gene (10q22.3).
Expression and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis
qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were performed as
previously described (9). For microarray expression array analysis,
total RNA from NCI-N417 and HCC-33 cells expressing two
different short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences against KAT6B
and two different scrambled sequences was labeled and hybridized onto a Human Gene Expression G3 v2 60K array following
the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR/ChIP primers and antibodies are described in Supplementary Table S1.
KAT6B mutational screening
KAT6B mutations were screened in complementary DNA from
60 SCLC patients and the SCLC lines using direct sequencing
(primers in Supplementary Table S1).
Short hairpin interference and ectopic expression assays
Two hairpin RNA (shRNA) molecules targeting two different
gene sequences of KAT6B mRNA (shRNA5 and shRNA8) were
designed and transfected into NCI-N417 and HCC-33 cells. The
described sequences were mutated in two sites to obtain two
shRNA scrambled sequences (Supplementary Table S1). For
ectopic expression experiments, cDNA from human KAT6B longest isoform was purchased from BioSource (I.M.A.G.E. predicted
full-length cDNA clones IRCBp5005P0112Q). KAT6B gene was
subcloned from pCR-XL-TOPO bacterial expression vector to

www.aacrjournals.org

pRetroX-Tight-Pur mammalian expression vector, within the Retro-XTM Tet-On Advanced Inducible Expression System. A FLAGtag in the carboxy-terminal end of the protein separated by a
ﬂexible Gly–Ser–Gly sequence was introduced.
In vitro proliferation assays
Cell proliferation was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) and XTT
(2,3-Bis-(2-Methoxy-4-Nitro-5-Sulfophenyl)-2H-Tetrazolium-5Carboxanilide) assays. The soft agar colony formation assay was
performed in 6-well culture plates. Cell proliferation was also
determined by counting living cells in the Neubauer chamber
using the Trypan blue approach. For dose–response assays,
10,000 to 20,000 cells were seeded in 96-well plates.
Mouse xenograft and metastasis models
Athymic nude male mice were subcutaneously injected in each
ﬂank with a total of 3.5  106 scramble NCI-N417 cells (n ¼ 10)
and shRNA NCI-N417 cells (n ¼ 10). Tumor growth was monitored every 3 to 4 days by measuring tumor width and length.
Pieces (3 mm3) of subcutaneous mouse tumors were implanted in
mouse lungs to generate an orthotopic SCLC mouse model (8
animals for each experiment). For the drug experiments, either
irinotecan (24 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline buffer) was injected into
the peritoneal cavity once a week for 3 weeks. For the metastasis
model, 1.5  106 cells were injected into the spleen of 24 mice.
Hepatic metastases were examined macroscopically and microscopically. Mouse experiments were approved by the IDIBELL
Animal Care Committee.
LC/MS-MS, protein sequence database searching, and SRM
Histone extracts were loaded into an 18% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel and the histone H3 bands were excised and
trypsin-digested. Peptide extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) using an
EASY nLC II (Proxeon) coupled to an amaZon ETD Ion Trap. Data
were generated with Data Analyst 4.1 software. MS and MS/MS
data were analyzed with ProteinScape 3.1.2 software using Mascot
2.4.0 as the search engine and SwissProt database. Identiﬁcation
was veriﬁed using a nanoACQUITY UPLC (Waters) chromatographer coupled to a high-resolution LTQ Orbitrap VelosTM MS.
H3K23 acetylation levels were quantiﬁed by selected reaction
monitoring (SRM) analyzing the precursor and fragment ion
masses from acetylated peptides on a hybrid triple quadrupole/
ion trap mass spectrometer instrument.
In vitro histone acetylation assays
Histone acetyltransferase assays were performed with GSTFlag–tagged KAT6B HAT domain puriﬁed from Escherichia coli.
One hundred nanograms of HAT domain was incubated in 20
mmol/L [acetyl-1-14C] coenzyme A and 1 mg core histones for 2
hours at 30 C. Incorporated 14C was detected by ﬂuorography
with low-energy intensifying screen and loading was assessed by
Coomassie staining. For H3K23ac Western blot analysis, histone
acetyltransferase assays using core histones as substrate and
unlabeled acetyl coenzyme A as cofactor were performed. Recombinant GST-Histone H3 was puriﬁed from E. coli and used as
substrates (1 mg) in the second radioactive histone acetylation
assay.

Results
Presence of KAT6B homozygous deletion in SCLC that leads to
gene inactivation
We ﬁrst screened a collection of 10 human SCLC cell lines for
copy-number alterations in histone-modiﬁer genes using the
Illumina Inﬁnium HumanOmni5 microarray, which interrogates 4,301,332 SNPs per sample. These included HCC-33,
NCI-N417, NCI-H1048, NCI-H1963, NCI-H2029, DMS-114,
DMS-273, NCI-H740, NCI-H2171, and NCI-H1672. Primary
normal tissues, such as lung epithelium and leukocytes, were
used as normal copy-number control samples. Microarray
SNP data have been deposited at the Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) under accession number GSE62775. Using this

approach, we conﬁrmed the presence of previously described
aberrant copy number changes in a subset of SCLC cell lines of
histone modiﬁers, such as the CBP histone acetyltransferases
(homozygous deletion; ref. 10) and the histone methyltransferase SETDB1 (gene ampliﬁcation; ref. 9). However, and most
interestingly, we found a previously unreported homozygous
deletion of the candidate K(lysine) acetyltransferase 6B (KAT6B;
refs. 11–13), also known as MYST4 and MORF, in two of the 10
(20%) SCLC cell lines: NCI-H1963 (463,888 bp) and NCIH740 (780,137 bp; Fig. 1A). The tumor suppressor PTEN,
undergoing also homozygous deletion in SCLC (14) and located 12,830,231 bp far away from the KAT6B gene, was not
included within the described minimal deleted regions. KAT6B
undergoes genomic translocation in subtypes of acute myeloid

of KAT6B was calculated by the standard curve method using the 7900HT SDS program. DNA from normal lung ﬁbroblasts (Wi-38) was used as the reference
standard. C, MLPA assay. Two different probe mixes contain one probe for each exon of the KAT6B gene, two probes upstream and one probe for
intron 3 (orange). Twenty reference probes are included (gray). MLPA images from one of the two probe mixes are shown. Values of 0 were
considered as homozygous loss. NCI-H1963 and NCI-H740 cell lines show the KAT6B homozygous deletion, while HCC-33 and NCI-N417 are shown as
examples of KAT6B two copy number cells. D, FISH of the KAT6B gene. The UCSC Genome Browser was used to select the BAC clone spanning the 10p15.3

leukemia (15, 16) and uterine leiomyomata (17), and KAT6B
mutations have also been recently associated with the development of genitopatellar syndrome and Say-Barber-BieseckerYoung-Simpson syndrome (SBBYSS or Ohdo syndrome; refs.
18–20). Data mining of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia copynumber variation data derived from a lower resolution SNP
microarray (21) conﬁrmed the presence of the KAT6B homozygous deletion in NCI-H1963 (Supplementary Fig. S1), while
NCI-H740 was not included in the described study. Using a
quantitative genomic PCR approach (Fig. 1B), MLPA (Fig. 1C)
and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH; Fig. 1D), we
conﬁrmed the presence of the KAT6B homozygous deletion in
NCI-H1963 and NCI-H740. The remaining eight SCLC cell lines
did not exhibit any homozygous loss of KAT6B (Fig. 1A–D).
KAT6B 50 -CpG island promoter methylation was not found in
any SCLC cell line (Supplementary Fig. S1). Copy number and
RNA expression levels for other histone acetyltransferases in the
studied SCLC cell lines are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. The
SCLC cell lines underwent mutational screening for the 18 exons
of the KAT6B gene using direct Sanger sequencing. The only
nucleotide change that we detected was, in the NCI-H1048 cell
line, a deletion of a GAA triplet coding for a glutamic acid within
a stretch of glutamic amino acids in exon 16: it has been
described as a polymorphic variant in the COSMIC Sanger
database. Splicing defects were not speciﬁcally sought and could
be another mechanism of gene silencing. Using quantitative
reverse-transcription PCR and Western blot analysis, we found
that the expression of KAT6B for both mRNA and protein was
lost in the SCLC cancer cell lines NCI-H1963 and NCI-H740,
which harbor the KAT6B homozygous deletion (Fig. 1E and
Supplementary Fig. S3).
KAT6B has tumor suppressor–like properties in cancer cells
Once we had demonstrated the presence of KAT6B genomic
loss in the SCLC cell lines, we examined its contribution to the
tumorigenic phenotype in vitro and in vivo. We ﬁrst analyzed the
effect of KAT6B depletion in lung cancer cells retaining both
copies of genes such as HCC33 and N417 (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Supplementary Table S1 illustrates the
shRNA sequences used. We observed that the reduction of
KAT6B expression in the described cells, compared with the
scramble shRNAs, had cancer growth-enhancing features, such
as increased viability in the MTT assay (Fig. 2B), and formed
more colonies (Fig. 2C). The XTT assay and Trypan blue staining
further conﬁrmed the growth-enhancing features of KAT6Binduced depletion (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, we
observed that KAT6B shRNA-depleted cells also showed diminished expression of Brahma (BRM), a known KAT6B target
(Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 22), and the BRM-target E-cadherin
(Supplementary Fig. S4; ref. 23), both being proteins that
inﬂuence cell proliferation and metastasis. shRNA-mediated
depletion of KAT6B also induced an increase in Rb phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. S4). We next tested the ability of
KAT6B shRNA-transfected N417 cells to form subcutaneous
tumors in nude mice compared with scramble shRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). Cells with shRNA-mediated depletion of
KAT6B formed tumors with a greater weight and volume, but
N417-scramble shRNA-transfected cells showed much lower
tumorigenicity (Fig. 2D). We then performed an orthotopic
growth study, implanting equal-sized tumor pieces from the
subcutaneous model in the lung. We observed that orthotopic

www.aacrjournals.org

KAT6B shRNA-depleted tumors were signiﬁcantly bigger and
heavier than the scramble shRNA-derived tumors (Fig. 2E). We
also proceeded with the converse experiment in which we used
a retroviral-inducible expression system to recover by transfection the expression of KAT6B (longest isoform, 231 kDa) in
H1963 cells bearing the aforementioned homozygous gene
deletion (Fig. 2F). H1963 cells transfected with either the
empty or the KAT6B vector were subcutaneously injected into
the nude mice. Tumors originated from KAT6B-transfected
H1963 cells had a signiﬁcantly smaller volume than empty
vector–transfected-derived tumors after doxycycline activation
of gene expression (Fig. 2F). The halt in cellular growth upon
restoration of KAT6B expression was observed for a long period
of time (49 days; Supplementary Fig. S4). Finally, the potential
distant inhibitory dissemination activity of KAT6B was measured in athymic mice by direct spleen injection and analysis
of metastasis formation in the liver (Fig. 2G). Whereas numerous metastatic nodules developed in the liver following injection of KAT6B shRNA-depleted empty N417 cells, less metastasis formation was observed with the scramble shRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 2G). Overall, our ﬁndings suggest tumorsuppressor and dissemination-inhibitor roles for KAT6B.
Lysine 23 of histone H3 as a target of KAT6B-mediated
acetylation
We next wondered about the molecular mechanisms that
could mediate the identiﬁed tumor-suppressor features of
KAT6B. In trying to address this issue, we ﬁrst encountered the
serious obstacle that the histone lysine residues targeted for
acetylation by human KAT6B have not been completely characterized in vivo. KAT6B is a member of the MYST family of
histone acetyltransferases that also includes KAT6A (MYST3/
MOZ), KAT7 (MYST2/HBO1), KAT5 (Tip60), and KAT8
(MYST1/MOF; Fig. 3A). Because of the greater homology of
KAT6B with the bona ﬁde histone H3 acetyltransferase KAT6A
(24–26), which also undergoes genomic translocations in
acute myelogenous leukemia (27, 28), and the initially reported
in vitro speciﬁcity of the KAT6A/KAT6B complex for histone
H3 but not for histone H4 (29, 30), we focused our interest
on this particular histone. To identify the histone H3 target
sites for KAT6B, we compared H1963 cells transduced with an
empty vector or with the full-length KAT6B expression vector
(Fig. 3B). We used histone acid extracts resolved in an SDS–
PAGE gel, followed by digestion of the histone H3 band and
LC/MS-MS analysis. We determined from precursor signal
intensity of the two acetylated peptides, K.QLATK23acAAR and
R.KQLATK23acAAR.K, that acetylation of H3-K23 was enriched
upon KAT6B transfection in H1963 cells (Fig. 3C). Targeted
quantiﬁcation of acetylation of H3-K23 residue by SRM conﬁrmed the enhancement of this acetylated residue upon transduction-mediated recovery of KAT6B expression in the H1963
cell line (Fig. 3D). Using SRM, we were also able to study a
patient with the SBBYS type of Ohdo syndrome, who was
carrying truncating mutation of KAT6B (31, 32), and who
showed a reduced level of both acetylated H3-K23 peptides
(Fig. 3D). Western blot analyses also conﬁrmed the LC/MS-MS
data by showing that H3-K23 acetylation increased upon
KAT6B transfection in H1963 cells (Fig. 3E). The activity of
KAT6B for acetyl-K23 H3 was conﬁrmed by Western blot
analysis in two additional models: KAT6B shRNA-depleted
N417 cells showed a reduction of the described acetylation

mark (Fig. 3E), and the aforementioned SBBYS type of Ohdo
syndrome patient with the KAT6B truncating mutation also had
a lower level of acetylated H3-K23 (Fig. 3E). KAT6B speciﬁcity
for this histone residue was further demonstrated by showing
that acetylation of lysine 14 of histone H3 and lysine 16 of
histone H4, mediated by the MYST family members KAT6A
(MYST3/MOZ; refs. 25, 26, 29) and KAT8 (MYST1/MOF;
refs. 33, 34), respectively, were not modiﬁed upon KAT6B
restoration, depletion, or mutation (Fig. 3E). We also developed in vitro histone acetylation assays to further show the
activity of KAT6B for H3K23 acetylation. Using puriﬁed histone
core proteins from HeLa cells and a construct for the KAT6Bspeciﬁc HAT domain, we conﬁrmed that it acetylated H3-K23
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Importantly, a mutant HAT domain

protein for KAT6B in K815, a strictly conserved lysine residue in
the MYST family (35), was unable to acetylate H3-K23 (Supplementary Fig. S5). In addition, the in vitro activity of KAT6B
for H3-K23 was conﬁrmed using a recombinant histone H3 as a
substrate: the wild-type cloned KAT6B-HAT domain acetylated
the described residue and the K815 mutant was unable to do
so (Supplementary Fig. S5). Using shRNA-mediated depletion
of four histone deacetylases (HDAC1, HDAC2, HDCA3, and
HDAC6) in NCI-N417 cells, we observed that, upon HDAC1
downregulation, there was an increase in acetylated H3-K23
levels (Supplementary Fig. S5), suggesting that this last HDAC
mediates the deacetylation event at this residue.
We next wondered about gene targets whose normal expression could be diminished in cancer cells by the loss of KAT6B-

KAT6B is a histone acetyltransferase targeting lysine 23 of histone H3. A, diagram of the MYST (SAS/MOZ) family with its recognized domains. The

Zf-C2HC, zinc ﬁnger, C2H2 type; MYST/KAT, MYST-type HAT (histone acetyltransferase) domain. B, Western blot analysis shows efﬁcient
transduction of KAT6B in NCI-H1963 cells in comparison with empty vector–transfected cells. C, MS spectra of QLATKacAAR and KQLATKacAAR
tryptic peptides identiﬁed by LC/MS-MS. A representative ﬁgure is shown of the precursor intensity based on the integration of the signal from the
extracted ion chromatogram. KAT6B NCI-H1963-transfected cells show a sharp increase in H3K23 acetylation intensity in both of the identiﬁed peptides
compared with the empty vector–transfected cells. D, SRM quantiﬁcation of the two H3K23ac peptides. Results were normalized with respect to the
transitions of the corresponding heavy synthetic peptide and were related to the empty vector (top) or normal lymphocytes (bottom). Targeted
quantiﬁcation conﬁrms the enhancement of this acetylated residue for the two peptides upon transfection-mediated recovery of KAT6B expression in
H1963 cells (top) and its reduction in a patient of SBBYS type of Ohdo syndrome carrying a truncating mutation of KAT6B (bottom). Differences
between the transitions were examined with the Student t test.  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001. E, Western blot analysis conﬁrms the activity

Ohdo syndrome patient with the KAT6B-truncating mutation (bottom). H3K14ac and H4K16ac did not change in any condition. F, qRT-PCR and
H3K23ac ChIP analysis shows that, upon KAT6B-shRNA depletion in NCI-N417 cells, the downregulation of the candidate genes is associated with
diminished acetylation of H3K23 residue in the promoters. Permutation tests,   , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01.

mediated H3-K23 promoter acetylation, a histone mark usually
associated with gene activation. To identify KAT6B target genes
that might ﬁt this candidate criterion, we used the shRNA
approach to deplete KAT6B expression in N417 and HCC33
(both with the normal two copies of the KAT6B gene) followed
by expression microarray hybridization. The complete list of
genes undergoing expression changes is shown in Supplementary Table S2. Microarray expression data are available at GEO
under accession number GSE62775. Using this approach, we
identiﬁed 32 common genes repressed in both KAT6B-shRNA–
depleted lung cancer cell lines that were upregulated in scramble shRNA-transfected cells (Supplementary Table S2). We

conﬁrmed the expression changes of 25 candidate genes
(78%) by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (Fig. 3F and
Supplementary Fig. S5). The shift in H3-K23 acetylation status
in their respective promoters for four candidate genes was
observed by quantitative ChIP (Fig. 3F).

KAT6B locus using a collection of 60 tumors from SCLC patients
and identiﬁed the KAT6B homozygous deletion in eight SCLC
tumors (13%; Fig. 4A). Codeletion of PTEN was not observed in
the SCLC tumors with KAT6B genomic loss according to CNV
microarray data (36). Interestingly, screening for nonsense and
indels in the KAT6B coding sequence in these 60 SLC cases, we
identiﬁed a deletion of a "C" in the last exon (exon 18;
c.3824delC) that later creates a stop codon and renders a 798
amino acids shorter protein, suggesting alternative pathways for
the inactivation of the studied gene. Microarray expression data
were available for 19 of the SCLC patients studied (36), including
four who had the KAT6B homozygous deletion, and we observed
an association between KAT6B genomic loss and lower levels of
the transcript (Fig. 4B). Immunohistochemical analyses of 20
SCLC cases showed overall loss of KAT6B expression and acetylK23 H3 in the four tumors with KAT6B deletion, whereas both
protein and histone mark were clearly stained in the remaining 16
samples without KAT6B genomic loss (except in one case where
other mechanisms might account for an observed lack of stain-

ing). Illustrative cases are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6.
Interestingly, in those SCLC patients for whom we have clinical
information and a long follow-up over different stages (n ¼ 26),
the presence of the KAT6B homozygous deletion was associated
with signiﬁcantly shorter progression-free survival (log-rank test;
P ¼ 0.014; hazard ratio; 4.95; 95% conﬁdence interval, 1.21–
20.28; Fig. 4C).
The observation that the KAT6B homozygous deletion also
occurred in SCLC patients with even worse prognosis prompted us to examine whether the loss of this HAT was associated
with a particular sensitivity to any anticancer drug. Similar
scenarios have been described for inhibitors of histone methyltransferases, such as DOT1L (37) and the BET family of acetyllysine–recognizing chromatin "adaptor" proteins (38–40) in
which hematologic malignancies associated with gene-activating events involving targets of these pathways are more sensitive to these drugs. Using the model of KAT6B shRNA-transfected versus scramble shRNA-transfected N417 cells and the
calculation of IC50 values according to the MTT assay, we did

not observe any difference between the two types of cells for 28
HDAC inhibitors that target class I, IIA, IIB, and III, in addition
to pan-inhibitors (Supplementary Fig. S7). The compounds
and their HDAC targets can be found in Supplementary Table
S3. In addition, we did not observe any difference in sensitivity
for classic SCLC chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin or
etoposide (Supplementary Fig. S7). However, we found that
KAT6B-depleted cells were signiﬁcantly more sensitive to the
growth-inhibitory effect mediated by the chemotherapy agent
irinotecan, under clinical trials in SCLC, than any of the
scramble shRNA clones (Fig. 4D). The same result was observed
for HCC-33 cells (Fig. 4D). We also extended the in vitro cell
viability experiments to the in vivo mouse model, thereby
conﬁrming that orthotopic SCLC tumors derived from KAT6B
shRNA-depleted N417 cells were signiﬁcantly more responsive
to irinotecan than scramble shRNA-derived tumors (Fig. 4E).
Within our SCLC clinical cohort, 42% of cases (11 of 26)
underwent chemotherapy, but mainly platin-based combinations. Only 4 patients received irinotecan-based chemotherapy
and none of them had KAT6B homozygous deletion. Thus, it
was unfeasible to assess the role of KAT6B deletion as a
predictive factor of irinotecan-based treatment outcome in
this setting. Related to why irinotecan could be particularly
effective in KAT6B-deleted tumors, it has been reported that the
MYST family of HATs facilitates ataxia–telangiectasia mutated
(ATM) kinase-mediated DNA-damage response (41) and, thus,
it is possible that irinotecan-induced DNA damage cannot be
so efﬁciently repaired in the KAT6B deﬁcient tumors, leading
to the enhanced cell death. In this regard, we found that KAT6B
shRNA-mediated depletion caused a reduction of ATM expression and, upon irinotecan treatment, a lower phosphorylation
of H2AX (Supplementary Fig. S8). Overall, these data suggest
the existence of a therapeutic "niche" for the use of irinotecan
in the aforementioned subset of SCLC cases harboring the
KAT6B homozygous deletion.

Discussion
The initial high response rates to platinum-based chemotherapy regimens for SCLC in the late 1970s and early 1980s caused
great expectations for these therapies. However, these hopes were
shattered by the recognition of low 5-year survival rates, in most
instances only approximately 5% (1, 2, 42). More recent trials
with targeted therapies in SCLC have failed with no new drugs
progressing treatments beyond those of cisplatin and etoposide
(1, 2, 42). One of the main reasons for this disappointing scenario
is our limited knowledge of the molecular driver events in SCLC.
Beyond the high prevalence of TP53 and RB1 mutations, which
have not proven amenable to pharmacology-based therapies so
far, we have a scarce knowledge of the genetic defects underlying
the natural history of SCLC. A recent breakthrough in this area has
been the identiﬁcation of mutations in histone modiﬁers, such as
the histone methyltransferase MLL1 or the histone acetyltransferases CREBBP (KAT3A) and EP300 (KAT3B), in a subset of
SCLCs (4). In this context, our identiﬁcation of KAT6B homozygous deletions in both SCLC cell lines and primary tumors
upgrades the genetic disruption of histone modiﬁer genes as the
second most common class of altered genes in SCLC. Importantly,
we deﬁne for the ﬁrst time, an in vivo target site for the acetyltransferase activity of KAT6B, lysine 23 of histone H3. This histone
posttranslational modiﬁcation has been previously associated

www.aacrjournals.org

with a more open chromatin state and the transcriptional activation of the underlying DNA sequence (43, 44). Interestingly, the
diminished acetylation of H3-K23 seems to be a hallmark of SCLC
tumorigenesis, because the other two frequently mutated histone
acetyltransferases (CREBBP and EP300) can also target this particular histone amino acid (43–45).
An interesting issue derived from our studies is the potential
exploitation of the KAT6B histone acetyltransferase defect to
design more personalized therapies that could improve the
dismal outcome of SCLC. Epigenetic drugs are the focus of a
growing interest in the cancer arena; however, a critical issue is
going to be the selection of those patients that are more likely
to respond to these compounds. For example, pediatric brainstem gliomas harboring a mutation in K27 of histone H3.3
are more sensitive to the pharmacologic inhibition of a K27
demethylase (46). Herein, we did not observe that KAT6B
depletion increases sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors, but other
epigenetic inhibitors can be tested in this model. These include
bromodomain inhibitors, targeting BET (bromodomain and
extra-terminal domain) proteins that "read" the acetylated
histone residues (39–41), or inhibitors of histone methyltransferases/demethylases, taking in account the competition
between acetylation and methylation that occurs at K23-H3
(47). In addition, because KAT6B tumor-suppressor properties
are, in part, mediated by downstream genes, like BRM, then
might the restoration of these gene(s) be therapeutic. However,
we have already found a drug where the diminished expression of KAT6B increases SCLC sensitivity in cell and animal
models: irinotecan. Currently, this compound is a second-line
treatment for the extensive stage of SCLC, while a platinum
agent and etoposide are ﬁrst-line therapies (1, 2, 42). Interestingly, as irinotecan is an effective drug for other tumor types,
such as colon cancer, it would be interesting to explore
if KAT6B status is associated with sensitivity to this drug
beyond SCLC. Herein, our results pinpoint a subgroup of SCLC
patients, those carrying the KAT6B genomic loss, where prospective clinical trials to assess the efﬁcacy of irinotecan can be
further studied.
