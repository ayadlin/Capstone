BACKGROUND: Increasingly, early phase clinical trials involve pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK)
assays as well as frequent imaging studies. The authors conducted a prospective study examining patients’ willingness to undergo such tests and the number of tests the patients would tolerate. METHODS: A prospective, correlative
study was conducted using a self-reported questionnaire to measure patients’ willingness on a scale from 1 (not willing) to 10 (very willing) to undergo various procedures (eg, tumor and skin biopsies, blood tests) and imaging studies
(eg, magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiogram). In addition, correlations were assessed between the number and
type of tests and demographics, previous test experience, inconvenience, and insurance coverage. Sixty-one patients
(22 women and 39 men) with advanced malignancies were enrolled. Descriptive, nonparametric, and parametric
inferential statistics were used. RESULTS: Overall willingness to undergo study-required tests was very high. Patients
were most willing to undergo urine, blood, ultrasound, x-rays, echocardiogram, and computed tomography studies
and were least willing to undergo tumor and skin biopsies and magnetic resonance imaging (all P  .01). Significant
inverse relations were observed between the frequency of a particular test and patient’s willingness to undergo such
tests. Inconvenience and prior negative experiences for more invasive tests (eg, skin biopsies) modestly affected willingness to undergo these tests again. College education, insurance coverage, and the requirement of tests for enrollment were correlated positively with willingness to undergo tests. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings provide the
first prospectively collected data on patients’ willingness to undergo PK/PD tests and imaging studies associated
with early stage oncology drug trials and can serve as basis for further exploration toward the design of patientC 2011 American Cancer Society.

KEYWORDS: clinical trials, phase 1, oncology, pharmacodynamic markers.

In the era of biomarker-driven, clinical translational research, an increasing number of clinical trials involve optional or
mandatory pharmacodynamic (PD) and pharmacokinetic (PK) assays, imaging studies, and invasive procedures, such as
skin and tumor biopsies.1,2 These tests serve to guide dose escalation, assess target modulation, and determine early
response; and they may be useful for the development of biomarkers.3,4 Patient adherence to these tests is important for
safety and success of the study, especially because determining the optimal biologic dose and other biomarker-driven endpoints are becoming increasingly important in drug development.5

Patient Willingness for Tests on Trials/Tibes et al

Previous studies have addressed patient perceptions
and expectations of treatment outcomes, potential benefits and side effects, informed consent,6,7 and ethical
aspects of phase 1 oncology trials.8 To our knowledge, no
study has prospectively assessed patients’ willingness to
undergo PD/PK tests, such as skin biopsy or hair follicle
collection; has asked about patients’ willingness to participate in frequent imaging studies, including functional
imaging; or has assessed the number of tests/studies that
patients would tolerate in a single trial within the context
of evaluating biomarkers and the biologic effects of new
agents.
Therefore, the primary objectives of the current
study were to assess patients’ willingness to undergo such
tests and studies and to determine the number of tests
patients would tolerate in a single trial. A secondary purpose was to correlate the number and type of tests with
patient demographics, prior test experience, test inconvenience, and cost coverage. Results from our study may
be used in the design of biomarker-driven clinical trials
while recognizing patient’s motivation and readiness
to participate in increasingly complex clinical trials in
oncology.9-13

MATERIALS AND METHODS
In brief, before designing this study and its questionnaire,
an extensive review of the literature revealed only a few relevant studies,4,14 and none addressed the questions in
which we were interested. Therefore, a questionnaire was
developed by the participating authors based on their
combined extensive expertise and experience in oncology
drug development. Items were developed based on commonly encountered questions and procedures in early
phase oncology trials.
Study Design
We conducted a prospective, exploratory, correlational
patient survey/questionnaire study. Data were collected at
a single clinical research center that was conducting early
phase oncology trials.
Sample
Eligibility criteria included age  18 years; ability to read,
write, and speak English; and referral to, current enrollment in, or evaluation for an early phase (phase 1/2)
clinical trial with a diagnosis of advanced treatment-refractory malignancy. Patients who did not meet these criteria
were excluded.

1. Have you ever undergone a PET scan? (yes/no/unsure)
2. No. of PET scans: 1, 2, 3, 4
3. Inconvenience: Numeric rating scale [NRS] from 0 (minimal inconvenience) to 10 (severe inconvenience)

5. Willingness to undergo PET scan if mandatory for enrollment (yes/no)
6. Willingness to undergo 1, 2, 3, or 4 PET scans in a single trial: NRS
from 0 (not willing) to 10 (very willing)

Instrument
For this study, we used an investigator-developed, 2-part
(Parts A and B), multiple-item, patient-reported questionnaire. Both parts were preceded by an introduction,
instructions, and study-test definitions. Part A (n ¼ 56
items) was divided into 2 sections. Section 1 included
questions pertaining to demographics, clinical characteristics, and treatment history. Section 2 included questions
about diagnostic studies, such as positron emission tomography (PET), computed tomography (CT), x-ray,
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound (US),
and echocardiogram (ECHO). Other items assessed the
amount of time patients were willing to spend in healthcare settings per week and test coverage. Section 1 of Part
B (n ¼ 59 items) contained questions about PD assays,
such as skin and tumor biopsies and blood, hair follicle,
stool, and urine samples. At the end of the questionnaire,
a short section (Section 2, Part B) asked patients to give
feedback on the questionnaire’s quality and design, and
this section was intended for use in developing future
studies that address similar questions. Table 1 provides an
example of the questions that were asked. The questionnaire was pilot tested on patients and healthcare providers
to assess its clarity and ease of use. Feedback was incorporated, and the questionnaire was modified slightly before
full application.

Procedures
The study and the questionnaire were approved by the
local institutional review board (IRB), and written
informed consent was obtained from all study participants
before enrollment. Patients completed questionnaires either in the clinic or at home. Study coordinators were
available and assisted patients as needed for clarification
and questions on the survey/questionnaire. Data were collected between June 2008 and December 2008. Two
study coordinators/investigators entered and verified

(against the raw data) all data entered into Microsoft Excel
spreadsheets (Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash).

Data Analysis
Data were transferred to an SPSS data file (SPSS version
17; SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Ill) and were analyzed using descriptive and nonparametric and parametric, inferential
statistics. Nonparametric tests were used when data did
not meet distributional requirements for parametric statistical tests. To determine whether demographic variables
were related to patients’ willingness to undergo the various
tests, Mann-Whitney or Kruskal-Wallace tests were used,
as appropriate, and Spearman rho coefficients were used
for ranked data.
The primary analysis was conducted using generalized estimating equations.15 Because most answers were
marked in the higher range on the 0-to-10 survey scale
(with 0 indicating ‘‘not willing’’ and 10 indicating ‘‘very
willing’’), the data were skewed toward the higher numbers of the survey scale. To accommodate this skew and
accurately model the data, an inverse Gaussian (Wald)
distribution analysis method was used in which the 1-to10 scale was transformed into an inverse scale from 1 to
11 (to remove the zero); a 1 was added to each score to set
the minimum value at 1, with the maximum at 11 in the
inverse order (ie, 1 ¼ 11, 2 ¼ 10, . . ., 11 ¼ 1). To accommodate the tendency for within-subject responses for the
contiguous dataset to be more highly intercorrelated than
noncontiguous responses (eg, willingness to undergo 1
test and willingness to undergo 2 tests were more highly
correlated than willingness to undergo 1 test and willingness to undergo 4 tests), the working correlation matrix
was specified as autoregressive at lag 1. Finally, data were
transformed so that the ordering of values was identical to
that in the raw data with the addition of 1 to scores to
allow calculation of geometric means and standard deviations and to minimize the impact of extreme responses
(eg, ‘‘1’’ and ‘‘2’’) on estimates of central tendency.16
Linear trend tests (polynomial contrast) were conducted under the generalized estimating equations model
to assess the relation between the number of tests
requested and willingness to undergo the tests. The main
effect of test type also was assessed to determine whether
participants differed, on average, in their willingness to
undergo different tests. The urine sample was used as the
baseline comparator in this analysis, because it was identified as the 1 test participants were most willing to
undergo.

3278

Percentiles (50th ¼ median) and interquartile
ranges (25th and 75th percentiles) are reported for nonnormally distributed data. To assess the significance of
trends within the patient (eg, willingness to undergo 1, 2,
3, etc, tests), data were normalized using square roots
transformation, and a repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted on the transformed data. All significance tests were 2-tailed, and a ¼ .05 was used as the
criterion for significance. The study was approved by the
IRB at Scottsdale Healthcare Hospitals.

RESULTS
Participation
Patients were approached consecutively during clinic visits by study coordinators and were asked to participate. Of
70 patients who were approached for the study, 61
patients agreed to participate, and 9 patients refused.
Comments and reasons for refusals included mostly time
commitments or other conflicting study-related matters
(eg, other tests). For patients who declined to participate,
there was no bias toward patients from any individual
physician or toward being treated on a particular protocol.
The average time for patients to complete the survey was
30 minutes (range, 12-67 minutes). Table 2 displays the
sample’s demographic characteristics.
Table 3 displays the patients’ clinical characteristics.
Some patients reported more than 1 comorbidity, and 27
different tumor types were represented in the sample.
Although all patients were considered to have refractory,
advanced (mostly metastatic) malignancies, an unexpected finding was that approximately 54% of patients (n
¼ 33) stated that they did not know ‘‘their stage of disease.’’ Karnofsky performance status, knowledge of disease stage, and presence of comorbidities, for the most
part, were not correlated with the outcome variables/tests
(data not shown).
Analysis by Research Question

This question and analysis addressed overall willingness to undergo a specific test across all tests. Geometric
means and standard deviations are provided for the main
effect of tests (collapsed across number of tests; Table 4)
and are ranked in ascending order, with the patients who
were least willing to undergo the test at the top. Willingness to undergo tumor biopsy, skin biopsy, and MRI and

a
The willingness of patients to undergo the various tests was compared
with their answers for urine samples. A scale from 1 (not willing) to 11 (very
willing) was converted from the 0-to-10 scale that was used in the questionnaire as described in the text (see Materials and Methods, Data
Analysis).
b
Differed significantly from urine sample as a comparator (P<.05).

Prior test experience can have a positive or negative
influence on future willingness to participate in such
tests again. Most participants reported prior experience
with most of the tests (see Table 6). For those patients
who were unfamiliar with certain tests/studies, explanations of study procedures and tests were provided in the
surveys. Average willingness reported to undergo from 1
to > 4 tests was calculated and then correlated with each
patient’s ‘‘inconvenience’’ rating (Spearman rho).
Among patients who had a particular test in the past, the
more inconvenient/painful they found the earlier tests,
the less willing they were to undergo these tests in the
future. It is noteworthy that these correlations were
rather weak and were not significant for many tests,
including correlations for skin and tumor biopsies. Negative experience with a previous MRI had the strongest
negative correlation with being unwilling to undergo
MRI studies in the future.

The first column represents the number of patients who previously underwent each test. The second column correlates patients’ report of inconvenience/pain and their willingness to undergo these tests in the future.
Negative coefficients indicate that the more inconvenient/painful the test
was for patients in the past, the less willing they were to undergo that test
in the future. The higher the absolute value of the coefficient, the stronger
the correlation.

Research Question 5: To correlate willingness
to undergo tests with financial/insurance
coverage of tests

Patients were categorized into 2 groups: those who
would enroll in a trial only if it was fully paid by a sponsor
(n ¼ 31) and those who would enroll if it was partially
paid for by a sponsor or insurance (n ¼ 28). Without
exception, across all tests, the groups differed (P < .001)
in their willingness to undergo tests. Members of the partial payment group (n ¼ 28) were more willing to participate than those in the group who would participate only if
the trial was fully paid (n ¼ 31). Very few participants (n
¼ 4) indicated that they would not be willing to undergo
some of the various tests even if they were mandatory for
enrollment in a clinical trial. This indicates that most
patients were willing to undergo most tests regardless of
whether the test was voluntary or mandatory and whether
or not the test was paid for by a sponsor or insurance.

DISCUSSION
Early phase clinical trials in oncology have become
increasingly complex and require patients to participate in
a rising number of study procedures, including PD/PK
tests and imaging studies. The impact on patients of compliance with study procedures frequently is discussed, but
Cancer

July 15, 2011

prospective data similar to those presented here have not
been published. Patients with refractory malignancies
have limited treatment options and may be more likely to
comply with study requirements even if these cause inconvenience. Therefore, data examining patients’ willingness
to participate in the often invasive tests and to tolerate the
burden of frequent imaging studies (eg, time commitment) are of essential value to investigators, patients,
sponsors, advocacy groups, and regulatory agencies. The
objective of our approach of asking about willingness and
frequency of tests was to obtain a more quantitative readout and analysis from the posed questions.
In the current study, we have demonstrated that the
overall willingness of patients with refractory, advanced
malignancies to undergo study specific tests was very high.
Very few patients ( 4 patients for all tests combined)
were unwilling to undergo a/any particular test (and thus,
to risk not being able receive treatment on a particular
trial) even if a test was mandatory for trial enrollment,
indicating that patients indeed would undergo most
study-related procedures. Reasons may be obvious, such
as limited therapy options remaining or wanting to participate in a trial with a particular agent. Another explanation is that invasive and noninvasive tests are perceived as
less intrusive by patients than is commonly assumed.
Regardless, patients with advanced-stage cancer are faced
with a decision whether to obtain a new therapy regimen/
agent on study versus the overall inconvenience. Understanding and, for the first time, actually asking patients
with advanced-stage cancer themselves what they would
be willing to do to enroll on study must be investigated.
Thus, our main objective was to gain an initial insight
into and a better understanding of what such patients
would be willing to tolerate to receive treatment on a clinical trial.
Intuitively, patients were less willing to undergo
more invasive tests, such as biopsies. Somewhat surprisingly, prior experience with tumor biopsies did not have a
significant negative effect on patients’ willingness to
undergo additional tumor biopsies, indicating that most
tumor biopsies are acceptable to patients. However, a subanalysis indicated that willingness declined sharply for
more than 1 tumor biopsy in a single study, and undergoing serial biopsies was not met with great acceptance
(‘‘willingness’’) by patients. These results need to be confirmed in additional studies; nonetheless, physicians,
sponsors, and regulatory agencies should be cognitive
about the number of tumor biopsies asked for from
patients.

Original Article

In general, imaging studies were well perceived.
Ultrasound was the most accepted modality followed by
echocardiogram, x-rays, PET scans, and CT scans. It is
noteworthy that MRI was the least favored imaging test,
which suggests that MRI is more inconvenient to patients
than may be assumed by healthcare providers. With
regard to skin biopsies, most patients were very willing to
undergo these at least twice during a study. Other tests,
such as urine and blood samples, were accepted very well
regardless of frequency. Not surprisingly, the worse the
prior experience with a test, the less willing patients were
to undergo that test again. However, for half of the tests,
the correlations were quite modest and were not significant (Table 6), including those for skin and tumor biopsies, which often are thought of as the 2 ‘‘most invasive’’
tests. This indicates that prior experience with a test is not
necessarily a strong determinant of future willingness,
which is an important finding from our study, because it
is frequently perceived that invasive procedures potentially may dissuade patients from trial participation.
Demographics overall had little influence, apart from
college graduates and patients with higher income, who
had a higher positive association with willingness to
undergo most tests. Comparing the only 5 minority participants with the white/Caucasian participants indicated that
there was a trend for minority participants to be less willing
to undergo PET scans, CR scans, MRI scans, skin biopsies,
and stool samples than Caucasian participants (P < .05;
data not shown). We did not want to include this exploratory analysis along with the formal results; however, we
believe it is worth mentioning in this discussion, because it
emphasizes the need to pay attention to providing support
for minorities and less privileged socioeconomic groups,
and early phase oncology trials can be very time consuming4,17-19 and costly (eg, time off from work for relatives/
caregivers) even if insurance coverage is provided. These
observation needs to be confirmed in future studies.
The finding that 54% of patients with advanced, refractory disease did not know their stage of disease might
be surprising. This may indicate a lack of communication
between patients and their healthcare providers about the
true status of their disease or that patients may not place as
much emphasis on stage of disease, its meaning, and its
treatment implications as healthcare providers. It also
may reflect patients’ need to exhibit a healthy and ‘‘appropriate amount of denial’’ to maintain a sense of hope8 and
therapeutic optimism under difficult, life-threatening circumstances, as described previously.20 This latter aspect
was not intended to be tested in our questionnaire.

The current study was conducted at a single clinical
research center that conducts early stage (mainly phase 1
and 2) clinical trials. Patients were in the clinic to be evaluated and considered for new agent trials, which, in itself
presents a selection. Thus, our results should not be generalized to all study centers, to phase 3 and 4 cancer trials, or
to patients with early stage disease, because this study was
not intended to cover those patient populations.
The statistical analysis approach, although somewhat complex, was chosen to address the dependant
(within-participant) nature and skew (trend toward
higher numbers on the survey scale) of the data. It allowed
us to avoid simplifying assumptions (eg, compound symmetry in the covariance matrix) and took into account the
correlations across repeated measures taken from the same
participant.
Surprisingly, little is known about which specific
aspects of clinical trial participation patients perceive as
burdensome.21,22 Our findings are consistent with other
reports.21,23 Physicians may have a lower threshold for acceptable risk than patients and frequently anticipate more
anxiety in their patients than the patients actually report.4
Results from our study lend support to investigators and
referring nononcology physicians for the idea that the
informed patient is highly motivated and very willing to
undergo invasive and time-consuming tests on clinical
trials.
In retrospect, the questionnaire and the questions
asked could have been modified with ‘‘posterior knowledge.’’ We hope that the presented data are valuable to the
field and will motivate other investigators to perform similar patient-oriented research in an extension of our
approach. Future investigations in this arena should
obtain data from multiple centers to allow greater generalization; investigate the correlation between patient willingness and investigator-perceived willingness; and
examine prospective correlations between self-reported
willingness and actual participation in specific procedures.
In summary, our prospectively collected data provide
physicians, investigators, study sponsors, and regulatory
agencies with an improved understanding of patients’
willingness to undergo trial-required tests to enhance the
design of biomarker-driven clinical trials in oncology.
