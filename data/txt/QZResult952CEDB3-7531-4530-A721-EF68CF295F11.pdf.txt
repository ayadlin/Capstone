ABSTRACT
Background: We have investigated the incidence of NTRK1 rearrangements in
metastatic gastrointestinal cancer patients and demonstrated the potential for clinical
response of these patients to targeted therapy.
Methods: We prospectively collected tumor tissue specimens for one year and
simultaneously generated patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs). Specimens were initially
screened for TrkA protein expression using TrkA immunohistochemistry (IHC). In the
case of TrkA IHC positive results, samples were further examined by fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) and next generation sequencing (NGS) to confirm the
presence of NTRK1 rearrangements.
Results: From January 2014 to December 2014, a total of 74 metastatic colorectal
cancer (CRC) patients and 66 gastric cancer (GC) patients were initially screened by
TrkA IHC. Two of the 74 CRC patients (2.7%) and one of the 66 GC patients (1.5%)
were positive for TrkA expression by IHC. All three IHC positive cases had evidence of
NTRK1 rearrangements by FISH. NGS was performed on the 3 IHC positive cases and
confirmed TPM3-NTRK1 rearrangements in the two CRC cases. One GC patient with
TrkA expression by IHC did not harbor an NTRK1 rearrangement. PDCs established
from the NTRK1 positive CRC patients were positive for the NTRK1 rearrangement.
Entrectinib, a pan-TRK inhibitor, profoundly inhibited cell proliferation of NTRK1rearranged PDCs with such inhibition associated with inactivation of TrkA, and downregulation of downstream signaling pathways.

Conclusion: TrkA IHC is an effective, initial screening method for NTRK1
rearrangement detection in the clinic. Inhibition of the TrkA kinase is a promising
targeted therapy for cancer patients whose tumors harbor a NTRK1 rearrangement.

INTRODUCTION

RESULTS

The Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor
1 gene (NTRK1) encodes the TrkA receptor, which is
a member of the TRK (tropomyosin-receptor kinase)
family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that
also includes TrkB (encoded by NTRK2) and TrkC
(encoded by NTRK3) [1]. In normal physiological
conditions, TrkA is activated through NGF-mediated
dimerization, which induces autophosphorylation of
specific tyrosine residues and transphosphorylation of
a series of substrates, leading to activation of PI3K/
AKT, Ras/MAPK and PLC-γ pathways  [2]. The first
NTRK1 gene fusion was identified in a colon cancer
specimen, which had sequences from the TPM3
(non-muscle tropomyosin) gene [3, 4]. Subsequently,
NTRK1 fusions have been detected at a frequency of 12%
in papillary thyroid cancer with TPM3-NTRK1 being the
most common gene rearrangement [5–7]. More recently,
NTRK1 rearrangements have been further identified in
other tumor types, including Spitzoid melanoma (16.4%,
23/140) [8], intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (3.6%,
1/28)  [9], glioblastoma (1.1%, 2/185) [10], pediatric
high grade glioma (7.1%, 8/112) [11] and sarcoma (1%,
1/103) [12]. This established evidence in various cancer
types suggests that oncogenic rearrangement of NTRK1
might occur at low frequency across many other cancer
types [13].
We previously reported the presence of a very
rare ROS1 rearrangement in gastric cancer (GC) with an
incidence of 0.8% using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
screening [14]. Since then, we have incorporated IHC to
identify very rare rearrangements in various tumor types.
Given the rapidity, broad applicability and low costs
of IHC in clinical diagnostic labs, we investigated the
prevalence of NTRK1 rearrangements in gastrointestinal
and colorectal cancers with TrkA IHC. Break-apart
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed
to confirm NTRK1 rearrangement in the IHC-positive
cases. Additionally, NTRK1 rearrangements were further
analyzed with NGS to identify the specific fusion
partner.
We identified 2 CRC patients that have
TPM3-NTRK1 gene rearrangements out of 74 CRC
patients in this study (2.7% prevalence). Patient derived
cells (PDC) from one of these patients demonstrate
a targeted tumor cell response, in both 2-D and 3-D
experiments, to the TrkA inhibitor, entrectinib. These data
demonstrate that NTRK1 gene rearrangements in CRC
patients are sensitive to treatment with entrectinib.

Patients’ characteristics

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

A total of 66 patients with GC and 74 patients with
colorectal cancer (CRC) were included in this study.
Of 66 patients with GC, 45 patients (68.2%) were male
with median age of 56 years (range, 30–80 years). Most
of the patients were stage III/IV (93.8%) and poorly
differentiated (80.3%). Most common metastatic sites
were as follows in the order of frequency: peritoneal
seeding (47.0%), liver (27.3%), lymph node (22.7%),
ovary (9.1%), lung (4.5%) and bone (4.5%). Detailed
characteristics of patients are shown in Table 1. In the CRC
group, median age was 60 years (range, 19–82 years) and
the male-to-female ratio was 0.85. Primary site of disease
is colon in 47 patients (63.5%) and rectum in 25 patients
(33.8%). Initial stage was mostly stage III (33.8%) or
IV (60.8%), and primary resection was performed in
59  patients (79.7%). Most patients showed good to
moderate differentiation (83.8%). KRAS mutation was
detected in 36.6%, and BRAF mutation was detected in
1.7%. Most common metastatic sites were as follows: liver
(47.3%), lung (37.8%), lymph node (29.7%), peritoneal
seeding (20.3%), ovary (12.2%) and bone (5.4%).

Identification of TrkA-positive cases
With five primary antibodies, we set up IHC with
different conditions and found panTRK (C17F1) from Cell
signaling as one of the most sensitive and specific primary
antibody and adopted this for screening. We found two
out of 74 CRCs (2.7%) and one out of 66 GCs (1.5%)
positive for Trk IHC. Representative photograph of Trk
protein expression by IHC is shown in Figure 1. In these
Trk(+) cases, FISH analysis showed break-apart of NTRK1
gene in three out of four examined cases; 68% (Patient #1,
Figure 2), 20% (Patient #2), and 20% (Patient  #3) of
examined tumor cells.

Characteristics of NTRK1-rearranged
cancer patients
Patient #1. The first case is a 72-year-old male patient
who presented initially with stage III KRAS wild-type,
BRAF wild-type ascending colon cancer in year 2013. He
underwent right hemicolectomy, and the pathology revealed
AJCC stage IIIB. He recurred with multiple cervical, left
supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, intra-abdominal lymph node
metastases after 5 cycles of adjuvant XELOX (capecitabine
and oxaliplatin) chemotherapy. The chemotherapy regimen

Patient #2. The second patient is a 71-year-old female
who was diagnosed in 2014 with multiple axillary lymph
nodes and multiple liver metastases from rectal cancer. The
tumor was KRAS and BRAF wild-type. After six cycles
of first-line Avastin/FOLFIRI chemotherapy (fluorouracil/
irinotecan/bevacizumab), tumor progressed to multiple
lower abdominal lymphadenopathies. The patient has
completed 12 cycles of second-line FOLFOX (oxaliplatin,
5-FU, leucovorin) chemotherapy with stable disease. This
patient was confirmed to have TPM3-NTRK1. fusion by
NGS (identical to patient #1, see Figure 2).

has been switched to irinotecan/capecitabine chemotherapy,
which stabilized the disease for 4 months, but then the
disease progressed to the lymph nodes. At this time, core
biopsy from a supraclavicular lymph node was performed
and, after tumor confirmation, we generated PDCs from the
patient. The patient has progressed to cetuximab/irinotecan
chemotherapy and is now deceased. The tumor has been
confirmed by NGS to harbor the previously observed TPM3NTRK1. fusion with the 5′ end of NTRK1, including the
kinase domain, starting at exon 10 fused to exon 7 of TPM3
(see Figure 2).

Patient #3. The third patient is a 68-year-old male
who presented with metastatic gastric cancer with metastases
to retroperitoneal lymph nodes and supraclavicular lymph
nodes. The patient has HER2 negative adenocarcinoma. The
patient has received 12 cycles of FOLFOX and 8 cycles of
irinotecan at the time of this writing. Although this patient
had Trk(+) by IHC and FISH, NGS failed to find NTRK
rearrangements because of poor quality of RNA.

Patient-derived tumor cells (PDCs) were established
from metastatic lymph nodes from patient #1. After
cytological confirmation, the PDCs were treated with
entrectinib. Entrectinib is a potent, selective, orally
available, ATP-competitive inhibitor of tyrosine kinases
TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ROS1 and ALK (encoded by NTRK1,
NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK genes, respectively).
The presence of NTRK1 rearrangement was confirmed
in PDCs by genomic profiling (not shown). This tumor
is negative for ROS1 and ALK gene rearrangement or
protein expression (data not shown). The IC50 from
the conventional MTT assay demonstrated 0.0082 uM
entrectinib (Figure 3B). Using high-throughput
3-dimensional culture system, the IC50 was 0.089 uM
for entrectinib in NTRK1 rearranged colon cancer PDCs
(Figure 3C). Western blot revealed that entrectinib potently
inhibited TrkA phosphorylation and targeted downstream
pathways (Figure 3D).

NTRK1 rearrangements. However, the two TrkA IHC+
GC patients were not positive for NTRK1 FISH. From this
data, we have demonstrated that IHC is a viable screening
strategy for NTRK1 rearrangements in CRC. Tumor cells
derived from one of the two TrkA IHC+ CRC patients were
sensitive to a potent pan-TrkA inhibitor, entrectinib, with
inhibition of downstream pathways, suggesting that NTRK1
rearrangements in non-lung or non-thyroid cancer can be a
potent actionable genetic aberration as in NSCLC [18].
Since the first discovery of the TPM3-NTRK1 fusion
in a colon cancer sample in 1982 [3], clinical development
targeting this molecular subset has not been highlighted
in metastatic colon cancer. Recently, Ardini et al used
TrkA IHC to identify one TPM3-NTRK1 rearrangement
out of 66 patients tested [18], demonstrating a prevalence
of 1.5% that is comparable to what is observed in the
cohort described here (2.7%). Both of TrkA CRC cases
reported here were KRAS wild-type and BRAF wild-type,
whereas the case reported by Ardini et al was KRAS wildtype. [18] However, in one GC, we failed to prove NTRK
rearrangements by NGS due to poor quality of RNA and the
existence of NTRK1 rearrangement in GC remained to be
proven in the near future.
The clinical benefit from targeting NTRK1 fusions
is being tested in ongoing phase I/II entrectinib clinical
trials. Entrectinib is an orally available, potent and
selective ATP-competitive pan-Trk, ROS1 and ALK
inhibitor with IC50 activities against TrkA. TrkB and
TrkC of <10 nM [19]. In this report, we successfully
established patient tumor cells from a TPM3-NTRK1
fusion CRC patient and demonstrated that these cells
were potently inhibited by entrectinib at an IC50
of 8.2nM in the conventional MTT assay and 89 nM
in 3-dimentional high throughput drug screening
system. Although more data needs to be accumulated
to demonstrate the concordance between responses to
therapy in patient derived tumor cells and the actual
tumor response in the corresponding patient, it is
very promising that the tumor cells from patients with
TPM3-NTRK1 fusion gene dramatically responded to
entrectinib. Of note, we also demonstrated that the four
TrkA IHC+ patients were all negative for rearrangements
in NTRK2, NTRK3, ROS1 and ALK, precluding
alternative target effects besides TrkA (NTRK1 gene).
Re-expression of TPM3-NTRK1 in Ba/F3 further
confirms that TPM3-TrkA fusion protein along is
capable to be oncogenic driver. Therefore Inhibition
of the TrkA kinase is a promising targeted therapy
for cancer patients whose tumors harbor a NTRK1
rearrangement.

DISCUSSION

MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this study, the incidence of TrkA (encoded by
NTRK1) IHC positivity is 1.5% in gastric cancer and 2.7%
in colorectal cancer patients by IHC. Both of the TrkA
IHC positive CRC cases were confirmed to have TPM3-

Confirmation of TPM3-NTRK1 fusion as an
oncogenic driver in vitro
TPM3-NTRK1 cDNA was cloned from KM12 cells by
RT-PCR and TPM3-TrkA protein was expressed in Ba/F3
cells using lentiviral expression system. Two weeks after
the Ba/F3 cells were cultured in mIL3 and puromycin, the
cells were further cultured in RPMI media without mIL3 and
puromycin for additional 6 weeks. The cells showed robust
growth without mIL3, confirming its oncogenic driving
ability. Expression of TPM3-TrkA protein was confirmed
by Flow-cytometry and qPCR. Subsequently, Ba/F3-TPM3TrkA cells were treated with entrectinib for 3 days and the
cell viability was accessed using CellTiter-Glo® reagents. As
expected, entrectinib inhibits the cell proliferation and the
IC50 value is the same as what was obtained from PDCs
(Figure 3A and  3B). Similar western blot profiles were
observed in these cells (data not shown)

Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)

Seoul, Korea, between January 2014 and December 2014.
All study participants provided written informed consent
before study entry. Briefly, patients with metastatic solid
tumors who may be eligible for clinical trial enrollment were
eligible to enter the study. Patients also consented for in vitro
establishment of patient-derived cells (PDCs) for research
use if tissue was available.

For analysis of NTRK1 gene rearrangements by
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), in cases of
positive results of TrkA overexpression by IHC, we used
ZytoLight SPEC NTRK1 Dual Color Break Apart Probe
for the detection of translocations involving the NTRK1
gene at 1q23.1 (ZytoVision, Bremerhaven, Germany)
according to the operating instructions. With the use of
appropriate filter sets, the interphases of normal cells or
cells without a translocation involving the 1q23.1 band,
two green/orange fusion signals appear. A 1q23.1 locus
affected by a translocation is indicated by one separate
green signal and one separate orange signal. A threshold
of 15% nuclei positive for break apart signals was used to
establish the cut off for positive FISH.

Immunohistochemistry for Trk
Briefly, 4 μm tissue sections were deparaffinized
and rehydrated, and antigens were retrieved for
40  min in a citrate buffer (pH 6.1) at 95°C. We
used panTRK (C17F1 Rabbit mAb; 1: 100 dilution;
Cell Signaling) as the primary antibody incubating
15 min with Bond-max autoimmunostainer (Leica
Biosystem, Melbourne, Australia). DAB was used as
the chromogen, and the sections were counterstained
with hematoxylin. For positive control, we used KM12
cell line, which is known to have a TPM3-NTRK1
rearrangement.

system, we utilized the S+ Chip Analyzer (Samsung
Electro-Mechanics Co., Ltd, South Korea) to analyze the
image of the cells grown in 3D droplets on micropillars
as previously described [17]. Briefly, for intensity
measurement, the software defines the boundary of analysis
as each micropillar edge and calculates mean intensity by
dividing total green fluorescence intensities (represented by
8 bit values) in the micropillar with the total pixels of the
micropillar (boundary of analysis). In case of the area, the
software counts the number of pixel whose intensity is more
than background (established as 30, in the 8 bit green range)
and calculates area of the colonies [17].

Ba/F3-TPM3-TrkA cell generation and
proliferation assay
To generate Ba/F3 cells expressing TPM3-TrkA,
TPM3-TrkA cDNA was cloned from KM12 cells by
RT-PCR and inserted into a lentiviral vector
pVL-EF1a-MCS-IRES-Puro (BioSettia, San Diego,
CA). After  confirmation by direct sequencing,
VSVG-pseudo-typed lentivirus containing TPM3-TrkA
cDNA was introduced into the murine IL-3 dependent pro-B
cell Ba/F3. The transduced Ba/F3 cells were selected at 1
ug/mL of puromycin in the murine IL-3 containing RPMI
and 10% FBS media for two weeks. The stable cell pools
were further selected in RPMI and 10% FBS media without
murine IL-3 for 4 weeks. To evaluate the anti-proliferative
activity of entrectinib, Ba/F3-TPM3-TrkA cells were
seeded at 5,000 cells per well in 96-well assay white plates
(Costar #3610) with different concentrations of Entrectinib
(0 to 1 μM) at duplicates. Three days after incubation, cell
viabilities were measured by luciferase-based ATP level
detection using CellTiter-Glo® reagents (Promega, Madison,
WI, USA) and IC50s were determined by 4-parameter curve
fit with variable slope.

Immunoblot analysis
Total proteins from patient tumor derived cell
lines were isolated using RIPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA) containing a protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and phosphatase
inhibitor cocktail (Roche).Protein concentrations were
determined according to Bradford procedure using a
Quick Start Bradford Protein Assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, USA). Thirty μg of proteins were subjected to
10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and
electro-transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The
membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% v/v Tween 20,
and probed overnight at 4°C with specific antibodies:
pTrakA(Tyr490), TrkA, pPLCγ1(Tyr783), PLCγ1,
pAkt(Ser473) and Akt from Cell Signaling Technology
(Beverly, MA, USA) and beta actin from Sigma Aldrich.
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse
IgG (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA) were used as
secondary antibodies. Immune complexes were visualized
by enhanced chemiluminescence using ECL Western
Blotting Substrate (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL,
USA).

Patient-derived cell culture and reagents
Patient derived cell cultures were established as
previously described [16]. Tumors were removed using
core biopsy from a supraclavicular lymph node and then
homogenized. Extracted cells were cultured in RPMI
media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
0.5 g/ ml of hydrocortisone (Sigma Aldrich), 5 g/ ml of
insulin (PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ, USA), 5 ng of EGF and
FGF (PeproTech). Vemurafenib was purchased from Selleck
Chemical (Houston, TX, USA). Entrectinib was provided
by Ignyta, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA). After pathologic
confirmation, cells were seeded at 1 x 106 cells/10 mm dishes
or 5000 cells/well/96well plate and treated with 1 μM of
entrectinib. Treated cells were incubated for 72 hours at 37°C
in a humidified atmosphere of 5% carbon dioxide. These
conditions were used for analysis of Immunoblotting and cell
proliferation inhibition assays, which were run in triplicate.
Entrectinib is a TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, ALK, ROS1 inhibitor that
is currently undergoing a phase 1/2 clinical trial in the US
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02097810) and a first
in human study in Italy [14]. Inhibition of tumor derived
cell line proliferation was determined using CellTiter-Glo®
reagents (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. For 3-dimensional drug screening
