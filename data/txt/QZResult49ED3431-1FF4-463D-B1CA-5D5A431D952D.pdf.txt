Anti-angiogenic therapy for glioblastoma has been in the spotlight for several years, as researchers and clinicians strive to find agents
with meaningful efficacy against glioblastoma. Bevacizumab in particular, in the second half of the last decade, became the most significant breakthrough in anti-glioblastoma therapy since temozolomide. Optimism for bevacizumab has been somewhat challenged
given recent clinical trials that have raised questions regarding its clinical effectiveness, the optimal timing of its use and the validity
of endpoints, among other issues. In addition, uncertainty has recently arisen regarding the effects of bevacizumab on quality of life
and neurocognitive function, two key clinical endpoints of unquestionable significance among glioblastoma patients. In this review,

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma is the most common and most aggressive primary parenchymal brain tumor. Despite our best known therapy
(using concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy with temozolomide followed by at least 6 months of adjuvant temozolomide), the average survival is only approximately 15 months.1 In the inevitably recurrent setting of this disease, to our knowledge arguably no chemotherapy regimen has provided reliable or meaningful clinical benefit.2,3 In light of these suboptimal
outcomes, ongoing investigations aim to identify alternative therapies to complement or replace older cytotoxic therapies.
Along these lines, antiangiogenic therapy for glioblastoma has been in the spotlight for several years.
Angiogenesis and the Role of Antiangiogenesis in Patients With Glioblastoma

Tumor angiogenesis correlates to the pathologic grade of gliomas, and is controlled through a complex balance of angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor, hypoxia-inducible
factor 1a, and others.4-7 Considered chief among these is VEGF, which may be upregulated via multiple angiogenesispromoting pathways. In hypoxic conditions, commonly found as tumors outgrow their intrinsic blood supply, hypoxiainducible factor 1a accumulates and ultimately increases VEGF stabilization.8 However, even in the absence of hypoxia,
VEGF is often upregulated in glioblastoma through constitutive activation of mitogenic pathways such as Ras/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/akt, which increase VEGF downstream.9
An additional means by which angiogenesis occurs in glioblastoma is through so-called vascular mimicry.10-13 Separate from blood vessels produced through the angiogenic signaling described above, glioma stem-like cells have been
shown to differentiate into vascular endothelial cells both in culture and in xenografts. These non-VEGF-dependent endothelial cells hold genetic markers similar to the surrounding glioma tissue, such as amplification of epidermal growth factor
receptor or mutation of TP53.11,12
Early studies regarding antiangiogenic therapy were based on the hypothesis of inflicting direct endothelial injury to
vessels, inducing blood vessel pruning and therefore reduced delivery of nutrients and oxygen to highly metabolic tumor
cells.14 However, over the ensuing decades, subsequent studies suggested that tumor blood vessels are intrinsically abnormal in both structure and function. Based on this understanding, another potential mechanism of antiangiogenic therapy

that has emerged is vascular normalization, which leads to
increased chemotherapy delivery and improved radiation
effect through enhanced oxygen delivery.9,15-17
Early Study of Bevacizumab in Patients With
Recurrent Glioblastoma

Because of its importance in angiogenesis, targeted efforts
to block VEGF pathways have been ongoing for the past
several years, focusing on monoclonal antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitors. To the best of our knowledge, the
earliest and most resonant clinical successes involve bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody
against VEGF-A, composed of human immunoglobulin
(Ig) G1 constant and murine VEGF-binding regions.18 In
preclinical models, bevacizumab inhibited angiogenesis
and tumor growth, and was noted to augment the antitumor effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.19-23 Phase
1 studies in various solid tumors demonstrated a half-life
of nearly 3 weeks, and no dose-limiting toxicities.24,25
With this safety information, and in light of remarkable
998

successes in other cancers including those of the breast
and colon, oncologists began to use bevacizumab for the
treatment of patients with recurrent glioblastoma. In the
first such report, 21 patients were presented who received
bevacizumab and irinotecan as salvage therapy for recurrent glioblastoma.26 An unusually robust rate of radiographic response was reported in 9 of 21 patients, and 11
of 21 patients achieved stable disease. With these early
positive data and little toxicity, further study was
proposed.
Two single-arm, prospective, phase 2 studies by Vredenburgh et al followed, describing the use of bevacizumab and irinotecan for recurrent high-grade gliomas in a
total of 67 patients.27,28 Radiographic response in these
studies was demonstrated in approximately 60% of
patients, and the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS)
rate was 38% to 46%. In comparison, contemporary data
for other salvage regimens at that time demonstrated radiographic response in 5% to 10% of patients, and a 6month PFS rate of 9% to 15%.2,29,30

Bevacizumab for Glioblastoma/Field et al

Propelled further by this clinical success, the pivotal
AVF3708g/BRAIN trial came next, which was a randomized, noncontrolled, phase 2 study evaluating the activity
of bevacizumab monotherapy and bevacizumab plus irinotecan in 167 patients. In this study, using the criteria of
Macdonald et al,31 radiographic response was noted in
28% and 38% of patients, respectively, and the 6-month
PFS rate was reported at 42.6% and 50.3%, respectively.32 An additional single-arm phase 2 study of bevacizumab monotherapy in 48 patients published the same
year demonstrated radiographic response in 35% of
patients, and a 6-month PFS rate of 29%.33 A total of 19
patients went on to receive bevacizumab plus irinotecan at
the time of second disease progression, but no subsequent
responses were observed. The combination of these findings, along with minimal reported toxicity, led to the
accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2009 for the use of bevacizumab in the
treatment of recurrent glioblastoma, pending further
phase 3 study.34 However, it is interesting to note that the
European Medicines Agency did not approve bevacizumab for use in recurrent glioblastoma at that time, and
still had not as of early 2014. The lack of European approval is cited to be a result of there being no placebocontrolled data, and due to uncertain validity of the demonstrated outcome measures as a surrogate for true clinical
benefit.35,36
Bevacizumab-Based Regimens in Patients With
Recurrent Glioblastoma

Multiple subsequent studies have been reported since provisional FDA approval, seeking to better define outcomes
for bevacizumab, as well as to improve on them with alternative chemotherapy combinations. A prospective phase 2
study using every-3-week dosing of bevacizumab at a dose
of 15 mg/kg in 61 patients with World Health Organization grade 3 or grade 4 glioma demonstrated no obvious
differences in patient outcomes compared with contemporary studies using every-2-week dosing at 10 mg/kg,37 thus
allowing for flexibility in patient scheduling without clinical detriment. Several phase 2 trials of bevacizumab-based
combinations have also been reported for recurrent glioblastoma (Table 1),27,28,32,38-58 including bevacizumab
with irinotecan, irinotecan plus cetuximab, irinotecan plus
carboplatin, etoposide, fotemustine, sorafenib, temozolomide, erlotinib, and temsirolimus.27,28,32,38-47 In addition,
several retrospective studies have also been reported combining bevacizumab and irinotecan; carboplatin; carboplatin and cetuximab; carboplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide;
lomustine; carmustine; etoposide; or temozolomide.48-58

Although these small studies are not easily compared due to
their size and various patient populations, the consensus to
date has been that no combination significantly surpasses
the outcomes of bevacizumab monotherapy for recurrent
glioma.9
Newly Reported Bevacizumab Trials

Preliminary results of several other trials involving bevacizumab for the treatment of glioblastoma have recently
been presented (Table 2).32,59-68 The randomized phase 2
GLARIUS trial compared bevacizumab, irinotecan, and
radiotherapy versus standard temozolomide and radiation
in patients with O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase
(MGMT)-unmethylated, newly diagnosed glioblastoma.59 This study found the combination of bevacizumab and irinotecan with radiotherapy to be more
favorable than standard therapy, with the 6-month PFS
rate reported at 79.5% versus 41.3%, and a mean PFS of
9.7 months versus 6 months, respectively. Preliminary
overall survival (OS) results were statistically significant,
with a median OS of 16.6 months versus 14.8 months.
In the recurrent glioblastoma setting, the BELOB
phase 2 study randomized 148 patients at the time of first
recurrence into 3 treatment arms of bevacizumab monotherapy, lomustine monotherapy, or bevacizumab plus
lomustine.60 In this study, patients in the combination
arm had better outcomes than patients in either of the
monotherapy arms, with the primary endpoint of 9month OS rate of 38% versus 43% versus 59%, respectively. In addition, the median OS was 8 months versus 8
months versus 11 months, respectively, with an impressive improvement in the 6-month PFS rate at 18% versus
11% versus 41%, respectively. This is an important study
in that it included a control arm that did not receive bevacizumab, thus providing the first randomized comparison
between bevacizumab and chemotherapy. In addition, we
also believe it to be the first study to demonstrate a survival benefit of chemotherapy added to bevacizumab in
comparison with single-agent bevacizumab. The authors
concluded that a phase 3 follow-up study was warranted
based on these findings, and the current European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)
26101 study has been modified accordingly to a 2-arm
phase 3 trial comparing lomustine plus bevacizumab versus
lomustine monotherapy.
It is notable that the 6-month PFS rate for bevacizumab monotherapy in the BELOB trial was only 18%,
which is substantially lower than the rate of 43% that was
reported in the BRAIN study.32 This may be partly
related to the BELOB study using the more sensitive

Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria for the assessment of disease progression, rather than
the McDonald criteria used in the BRAIN study.31 The
RANO criteria take into account nonenhancing tumor
volume in addition to contrast-enhancing tumor measurements.69 This is of key importance, especially in the
setting of antiangiogenic therapies such as bevacizumab,
which alter vascular permeability and may therefore result
in a decrease in radiological contrast enhancement that is
not necessarily an antitumor effect. Thus, taking nonenhancing tumor into consideration in response assessment
may be a more accurate determination of tumor status.
In addition, the 6-month PFS of 11% noted for
lomustine monotherapy in the BELOB trial was considerably lower than the rate of 25% for lomustine plus placebo reported in the phase 3 REGAL study comparing
cediranib, cediranib plus lomustine, or lomustine monotherapy. Similarly, this represents a noteworthy difference
from the PFS rate of 19% in the phase 3 trial of enzastaurin versus lomustine.70,71 Although the reasons for
these differences are unknown, they do highlight the
1000

potential limitations of phase 2 studies with relatively
small sample sizes in each arm.
Bevacizumab in Patients With Newly Diagnosed
Glioblastoma: AVAglio and Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group 0825

Data from 2 pivotal studies assessing the efficacy of bevacizumab in the upfront setting were recently reported.
These 2 large-scale, first-line, randomized phase 3 studies
(AVAglio and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group
[RTOG] 082561,62) were reported along with a variety of
substudies arising from both. In many respects, the studies
were similar and yet there are essential differences that are
worth noting (Table 3).61,62,72-74 Both studies represent
significant achievements in terms of size, accrual, and
conduct.
The AVAglio trial, which was an international,
industry-sponsored, randomized phase 3 trial, examined
bevacizumab versus placebo when added to standard radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy. The coprimary
endpoints were PFS and OS; the overall alpha significance

level of .05 was allocated as .01 to PFS and .04 to OS. The
predefined PFS endpoint was met, with a median PFS of
10.6 months versus 6.2 months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.64;
95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.55-0.74 [P<.0001]),
although the OS endpoint was not met.61 The median OS
was 16.8 months versus 16.7 months (HR, 0.88; 95% CI,
0.76-1.02 [P 5 .0987]). Although crossover on disease progression was not planned on the AVAglio trial, it is estimated that up to 30% of participants not randomized to
receive bevacizumab ultimately did receive the drug at the
time of disease progression, thus potentially distorting any
potential OS benefits.
Although its protocol was slightly different from
that of the AVAglio trial, the RTOG 0825 study had a
similar design and coprimary endpoints of PFS and
OS.62 Two notable differences in design include a
planned crossover from placebo to bevacizumab in
RTOG 0825, as well as eligibility criteria excluding
patients who underwent biopsy only, which was not
the case in the AVAglio trial. The prespecified alpha
Cancer

significance level was also split differently, with .004
allocated to PFS and .046 to OS. In addition, the HRs
used for sample size calculations estimated a slightly
larger difference between treatment arms than in the
AVAglio trial (Table 3).61,62,72-74 The bevacizumab
arm demonstrated longer PFS than placebo (10.7
months vs 7.3 months; HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.94
[P 5 .007]), although this did not meet the predefined
PFS significance level. Similar to the AVAglio trial, no
difference in OS was noted between treatment arms,
with a median OS of 15.7 months versus 16.1 months
(HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.93-1.37 [P 5 .21]). The authors
of RTOG 0825 also noted increased risks of grade 3 or
higher toxicity in the bevacizumab arm, including
neutropenia, hypertension, and venous thromboembolic events.

function was assessed only in a small number of patients
in this trial.72 Specifically, 5 domains from the EORTC
QLQ-C30 and BN20, both of which are validated QOL
assessment tools, were preselected as secondary endpoints.
All patients were required to complete the questionnaires.
The study’s definition of time to definitive deterioration
(TDD) or deterioration-free survival was from randomization to a 10-point deterioration from baseline with
no improvement, progressive disease, or death. The median TDD was compared between the 2 treatment arms
and reported. In all 5 prespecified domains (Global
Health Status, Physical and Social Functioning, Motor
Dysfunction, and Communication Deficit), the median
TDD was significantly improved for patients on the bevacizumab arm. Similar findings were observed favoring the
bevacizumab arm for most non-prespecified domains of
the QOL questionnaires. Maintenance of a stable QOL
was extended for 3 to 4 months for patients treated on the
bevacizumab arm compared with the control arm during
the PFS period. It should be noted that QOL testing
included data at the time of disease progression, which
permitted separate analyses to be performed assessing
QOL before disease progression and up to the point of
1002

disease progression. The exploratory longitudinal analysis
demonstrated no difference in QOL score changes over
time between treatment arms; in other words, neither
harm nor benefit from bevacizumab was noted in the
scores.
The AVAglio trial also reported that the addition of
bevacizumab resulted in the significantly prolonged maintenance of Karnofsky performance status and increased
steroid discontinuation or delay in initiating steroids. The
AVAglio investigators concluded that these findings represented a “clinically meaningful” improvement in PFS.
This is in contrast to findings from the RTOG 0825
study, which similarly used the EORTC QLQ-C30 and
BN20 questionnaires, as well as The University of Texas
MD Anderson Symptom Inventory Brain Tumor Module
(MDASI-BT) to assess patient-reported outcomes. Testing was not a mandatory component of this trial. In this
study, also different from the AVAglio trial, longitudinal
collection of data was assessed only before disease progression. Both discrete time points were compared as well as
general linear modeling. The majority of QOL domains
were no different between arms, but the placebo group
was more likely to be stable for certain symptom domains
Cancer

Bevacizumab for Glioblastoma/Field et al

at certain time points. Some symptom groupings in the
MDASI-BT were reported as being significantly deteriorated in the bevacizumab arm and others improved in the
placebo arm at particular time points, although these were
not found to be sustained at all time points. The longitudinal modeling, controlling for recursive partitioning
analysis class and MGMT methylation status, found that
from 0 to 46 weeks on trial, patients treated on the bevacizumab arm experienced significant worsening in cognitive
functioning, motor dysfunction, and communication deficits compared with patients treated on the placebo arm,
as well as several subscales using the MDASI-BT. The
authors concluded that there was overall more deterioration in symptoms and QOL in the bevacizumab arm.73,74
To the best of our knowledge, steroid dosing and changes
in Karnofsky performance status have not yet been formally reported for the RTOG study.
In a separate presentation, neurocognitive function
outcomes for the RTOG study were reported.74 Three
measures were used: the Hopkins Verbal Learning TestRevised, Trail Making Test, and Controlled Oral Word
Association Test. A composite score was created to ascertain global neurocognitive function. Again, data were
compared for patients who had not yet progressed using a
longitudinal analysis. Overall, no statistically significant
differences between treatment arms were noted regarding
frequency of improvement, but over time a greater rate of
neurocognitive function decline for patients on the bevacizumab arm was observed for some measures, including
Global Cognitive Function, Processing Speed, and Executive Function, but not in measures of learning and memory function.
The cause of the apparent differences in QOL outcomes between these 2 studies is likely multifactorial.
First, there was substantial dropout among RTOG participants as the QOL assessments proceeded. Conversely, questionnaire completion was a requirement in
the AVAglio trial, and therefore the majority of randomized patients had data available for analysis at most time
points, although there was also some attrition at the time
of disease progression. Second, the statistical methodology was different. The AVAglio trial used the median
TDD as previously defined, with other exploratory statistical testing including sensitivity and longitudinal
analyses confirming the robustness of the primary analysis. This compares to the RTOG 0825 study, which
compared patients who had not yet progressed using
both discrete time point analyses and general linear modeling (longitudinal analysis). Finally, the AVAglio trial
used a radiologic response criteria similar to the RANO
Cancer

April 1, 2015

criteria,69,75 which took into account nonenhancing disease progression, whereas RTOG 0825 used the traditional criteria of Macdonald et al that evaluated only
enhancing disease.31 Thus, there is concern that RTOG
0825 data regarding QOL and neurocognitive function
may have been biased by including a disproportionate
percentage of patients with early progressive disease on
the bevacizumab arm compared with the control arm.
However, it is interesting to note that in the AVAglio
trial, sensitivity analyses excluding the disease progression endpoint still resulted in similar findings for 3 of
the 5 prespecified scales and for multiple other nonprespecified questionnaire domains.
Given the clear differences in QOL outcomes
between these 2 studies, and the increasing recognition
that this is a critically important endpoint for consideration in clinical trials, it seems apparent that these data
must be analyzed objectively, perhaps by an independent
review committee, before any definitive conclusions can
be made regarding this important issue. Unfortunately,
data were not collected for QOL after disease progression had occurred; this would be valuable information
that could be built into future clinical trials, although
requiring ongoing patient participation beyond study
drug delivery poses potential ethical challenges for trial
design.
PFS as an Endpoint

PFS has been considered a surrogate endpoint in clinical
trials, meaning that on its own it is not a meaningful
endpoint unless it translates ultimately to a valid clinical
endpoint such as OS benefit. A surrogate endpoint
should thus only be used if it is found to reliably predict
the true clinical endpoint of interest. Herein lies one of
the key difficulties with the 2 large first-line bevacizumab
studies: although both demonstrated substantially
improved PFS for bevacizumab, neither study indicated
that this translated to an OS benefit. It is acknowledged
that the preplanned crossover to bevacizumab at the time
of disease progression in the RTOG 0825 study and the
likely high percentage of participants receiving placebo
who subsequently received bevacizumab in the AVAglio
trial may have at least partly contributed to the failure to
detect an OS benefit for the drug, despite the seemingly
promising PFS findings. This conundrum is reminiscent
of the withdrawal of bevacizumab in late 2011 from its
previously accelerated FDA approval for metastatic
breast cancer after additional studies and reviews
concluded that the drug failed to improve OS or QOL
despite improving PFS.76

In considering the data from the AVAglio and
RTOG 0825 trials, as well as subsequent studies, an important consideration is whether PFS should be regarded
as purely a primary endpoint in neurooncology trials.
Whereas malignant gliomas are inherently invasive and
destructive within the central nervous system, tumor progression inevitably affects neurologic function, including
very important considerations for patients and caregivers
such as interpersonal interactions, the ability to partake in
meaningful activities, and the capacity to care for self and
others. As such, many may argue that for patients with
malignant gliomas, time without tumor progression (provided that this time is of good quality and not at the
expense of intolerable or dangerous side effects) is perhaps
equally or more meaningful than OS. Maintaining disease, and therefore symptomatic stability, could therefore
arguably be considered to be a meaningful clinical benefit.
Another contentious issue in neurooncology that predates antiangiogenic and other targeted therapies is whether
PFS serves as a surrogate marker of OS. Data from the
AVAglio and RTOG 0825 trials argue that PFS benefit
may not translate into downstream survival improvement.
Data from meta-analyses performed in the current era suggest that PFS predicts survival benefit, although these analyses are limited by the finding that they reflected essentially
negative clinical trials.29,30,77,78 Similarly, PFS may not be
objectively associated with improved/stable QOL or symptom control. In fact, even predating these studies, some
contentiously argued that the effect of bevacizumab on PFS
could simply be a reflection of the drug masking radiologi1004

cal disease progression or altering the recurrence pattern
without having a substantial impact on the disease process
itself.56,79 As such, the usefulness of PFS as a clinical trial
endpoint for patients with glioblastoma will need to be
explored further, both in its usefulness as a clinically meaningful endpoint as well as its association with QOL and
neurocognitive functions. Furthermore, similar to the
AVAglio trial, reliable correlation between PFS and maintenance of performance status may be worth exploring further. Finally, alternative endpoints for such trials may also
be worth consideration. As an example, the secondary endpoints of steroid discontinuation and delay to initiation of
steroids in the bevacizumab arm in the AVAglio trial
should be considered clinically significant given the morbidity and toxicity associated with prolonged steroid use.
The Search for Biomarkers

Parallel to efforts to best understand and maximize clinical
effectiveness with bevacizumab in patients with glioblastoma, others are searching for biomarkers to predict which
patients will respond best to this therapy. To our knowledge, no predictive biomarker for bevacizumab responsiveness has been validated in any tumor type to date.
At the 2013 annual meeting of the American Society
of Clinical Oncology, there were several presentations
related to biomarker searches in glioblastoma (Table 4)8088
that not only provided intriguing clinical insights but
also highlighted the importance of biomarkers in clinical
trial design. Both the AVAglio and RTOG 0825 trials
included an optional biomarker component. Preliminary

analysis from the AVAglio trial did not find a predictive
value for baseline plasma VEGF-A or VEGFR-2.80 An
RTOG 0825 substudy identified a 10-gene signature profile that was predictive of both PFS and OS among
patients receiving bevacizumab.81 This was a different
model from the 9-gene signature used for patient stratification in the trial, and was associated with differential outcomes in patients receiving bevacizumab, with a favorable
gene signature predicting response in both the training
and validation sets. When applied to the control arm
(those patients not receiving bevacizumab), there was no
difference noted with regard to PFS or OS between favorable and unfavorable gene signatures, suggesting this to be
predictive rather than prognostic. Further validation and
prospective evaluation will be forthcoming.
Separate from the search for predictive tools, several
other blood and tissue biomarker studies were presented
at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting
identifying potential prognostic indicators. Among these
were transcriptional subclasses, single nucleotide polymorphism of the VEGF-A gene (rs2010963), and matrix
metalloproteinase 2 levels.82-85 Similarly, early results in
imaging biomarkers were reported, including enhancing
tumor volume measurements, relative cerebral blood volume variation, perfusion maps, and contrast-enhanced
T1-weighted subtraction maps.86-88
Looking Forward

Despite the initial optimism and much ensuing research,
there remains uncertainty and many unanswered questions in relation to the use of bevacizumab in the treatment of patients with glioblastoma. We now know that it
does not confer an OS benefit when used in the de novo
setting, despite having clinical efficacy in the recurrent setting. However, it is worth noting that only one trial to
date, the BELOB study, demonstrated objective randomized evidence of an OS benefit in the recurrent setting of
glioblastoma. Before this, clinical decisions were made
based on single-arm, phase 2 studies and retrospective
data with historical controls.
The conflicting QOL data presented in the AVAglio
and RTOG 0825 trials further confound the issue, and
unless we obtain data connecting PFS and QOL, the
application of either of these endpoints will remain uncertain. Other unanswered questions include the optimal
dose and schedule of bevacizumab, and whether it should
be used as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy or other molecular-targeting agents.
Although opinions differ in the neurooncology community, albeit with reservations and some disappointCancer

ments, bevacizumab nevertheless remains the only
targeted therapy to have objective evidence of clinical efficacy compared with chemotherapy alone among patients
with recurrent disease (Fig. 1). We should take careful
note of the results we will obtain from the EORTC 26101
study, which will become the second trial to date to
directly compare bevacizumab and chemotherapy. At least
anecdotally, and in the tails of Kaplan-Meier survival
curves, some patients do appear to benefit greatly. Identifying those patients who may fall into this category is a
continuing issue and the search for predictive biomarkers
is currently ongoing. In addition, determining the best
method of tumor assessment after antiangiogenic therapy
is important. The ability to select those patients who are
most likely to benefit, and understanding how best to follow their disease, would be ideal. Given that bevacizumab
is not the panacea we hoped for all patients, the search for
other, newer agents and combinations that may help to
combat glioblastoma will continue.
