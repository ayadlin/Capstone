Abstract
Resistance to endocrine therapy is a major impediment to successful treatment of breast cancer. Preclinical and
clinical evidence links resistance to antiestrogen drugs in breast cancer cells with the overexpression and/or
activation of various pro-oncogenic tyrosine kinases. Disruption of circadian rhythms by night shift work or
disturbed sleep-wake cycles may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer and other diseases. Moreover, light
exposure at night (LEN) suppresses the nocturnal production of melatonin that inhibits breast cancer growth. In
this study, we used a rat model of estrogen receptor (ERaþ) MCF-7 tumor xenografts to demonstrate how altering
light/dark cycles with dim LEN (dLEN) speed the development of breast tumors, increasing their metabolism and
growth and conferring an intrinsic resistance to tamoxifen therapy. These characteristics were not observed in
animals in which the circadian melatonin rhythm was not disrupted, or in animals subjected to dLEN if they
received nocturnal melatonin replacement. Strikingly, our results also showed that melatonin acted both as a tumor
metabolic inhibitor and a circadian-regulated kinase inhibitor to reestablish the sensitivity of breast tumors to
tamoxifen and tumor regression. Together, our ﬁndings show how dLEN-mediated disturbances in nocturnal
melatonin production can render tumors insensitive to tamoxifen. Cancer Res; 74(15); 4099–110. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
Approximately 60% to 75% of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER)-a and/or progesterone receptor (PR), which
are markers and determinants for the use of endocrine therapies, including selective ERa modulators such as tamoxifen
(TAM; refs. 1, 2), pure antiestrogens, and aromatase inhibitors
(3–5). However, the development of resistance to tamoxifen
and other endocrine therapies has become a major impediment in endocrine therapy such that anywhere from 30% to
50% of patients with ERaþ breast tumors display intrinsic
resistance while most patients are initially responsive but will
eventually develop acquired resistance to tamoxifen (6).
Compelling data have emerged from breast tumor biopsies
and in vitro studies indicating that elevated expression and
signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases, including members of

the EGFR family and downstream MAPK/ERK and PI3K/AKT,
can drive tamoxifen resistance through phosphorylation of
either ERa at Ser167 or Ser118 to increase DNA binding or
coregulator binding (7–12) to regulate cell proliferation and
apoptosis. In addition, other signaling pathways are elevated or
activated in tamoxifen-resistant breast tumors, including SRC,
focal adhesion kinase (FAK), STAT3, and NF-kB (13, 14).
Numerous, studies have shown that the circadian melatonin signal regulates signaling and metabolic activities to
inhibit breast cancer initiation, promotion, and progression
(15–17). On the basis of early studies showing the anticancer
actions of melatonin in breast cancer, Stevens (18) hypothesized that suppression of nighttime melatonin production
by the pineal gland by light at night might explain the rise in
breast cancer rates that have accompanied industrialization
and electriﬁcation in the United States and other westernized countries. Light exposure at night (LEN) is a wellrecognized environmental disruptor of the central circadian
timing system located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN)
of the brain (19). Nighttime production of melatonin by the
pineal gland represents a highly reliable circadian output
signal of the circadian clock whose suppression by LEN is
intensity-, duration-, and wavelength dependent (20–22).
These and other data led the World Health Organization
to designate night shift work involving LEN-induced circadian/melatonin disruption as a probable carcinogen (class
2a) and risk factor for the development of breast cancer (23).
Furthermore, using our novel tissue-isolated MCF-7 human

breast cancer xenograft model in circadian/melatonin
intact female nude rats, we also report increases in tumor
growth rates and enhanced ERK, AKT, and AKT stimulatory
3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 activity (24–27), and
repression of GSK3b activity in breast tumor xenografts in
response to light exposure during the night or day and that
these changes are blocked by melatonin (28).
The above studies, in addition to those demonstrating that
physiologic nocturnal concentrations of melatonin signiﬁcantly
increase the sensitivity of ERaþ MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells to tamoxifen in vitro (29), prompted us to postulate that
dim light exposure at night (dLEN), by virtue of its ability to
suppress nocturnal melatonin production, will promote partial
or complete resistance to tamoxifen therapy in vivo. In the
present study, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that exposure to
dLEN, via suppression of the nighttime melatonin signal,
induces tumor progression and intrinsic resistance to tamoxifen in human breast tumor xenografts. Furthermore, the
maintenance of the endogenous melatonin signal or its replacement with exogenous melatonin under dLEN conditions preserves tamoxifen sensitivity and drives tumor regression.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals and reagents
All chemicals and tissue culture reagents were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Cell culture medium, RPMI-1640, and FBS
were purchased from Invitrogen Corporation. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-grade reagents were
purchased from Fisher Chemical. Free fatty acid, cholesterol
ester, triglyceride, phospholipid, rapeseed oil methyl ester
standards, as well as boron triﬂuoride-methanol, potassium
chloride, sodium chloride, perchloric, and trichloroacetic acids
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The HPLC standards, ()
5-HETE, and 13(S)-HODE) were purchased from Cayman
Chemical Co.
Cell line and cell culture
The ERaþ/PRþ, tamoxifen-sensitive MCF-7 human breast
cancer cell line (passage numbers 18–20) used in these studies
was obtained from American Tissue Culture Collection; ATCC.
These cells were tested and authenticated by ATCC and
immediately expanded, and frozen down as stock for future
studies. Cells from low passage frozen stocks (passage numbers 18–20) were used in these studies. Brieﬂy, cells were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS,
50 mmol/L minimum essential medium nonessential amino
acids, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 10
mmol/L basal medium eagle, 100 mg/mL streptomycin, and
100 U/mL penicillin and maintained at 37 C in a humidiﬁed
atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air.
Animals, housing conditions, and diet
Female athymic, inbred nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1rnu), 1 to 2
weeks of age, used in this study were purchased from Harlan
Laboratories. Upon arrival, animals were maintained in
environmentally controlled rooms (25 C; 50%–55% humidity)
with controlled diurnal lighting schedule of 12-hour light:12hour dark at subjective night (LD 12:12; 300 lux; 123 mW/cm2;

lights on, 06:00 hours, and off at 18:00 hours). Animal rooms
were completely devoid of light contamination during the dark
phase (30). One week before tumor implantation, two-thirds of
the animals were switched to a 12-hour light:12-hour dim light
at night, subjective night (dLEN) cycle (0.2 lux, with lights on at
06:00 hours and off at 18:00 hours, and dLEN on at 18:00 hours
and off at 06:00 hours) in an Assessment and Accreditation of
Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited facility and
in accordance with The Guide. Animals were given free access
to food (Purina 5053 Irradiated Laboratory Rodent Diet) and
acidiﬁed water as previously described (30, 31). All procedures
used for animal studies were approved by the Tulane University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (New
Orleans, LA).
Arterial blood collection
Diurnal plasma melatonin levels (pg/mL; mean  1 SD) of
na€ve, female nude rats (n ¼ 12) maintained initially in the
control LD 12:12 cycle (300 lux; 123 mW/cm2; lights on, 06:00
hours) or in the dLEN cycle were measured as previously
described (30, 31). In experimental animals during the course
of these studies, blood was collected over time at six circadian
time points (04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, and 24:00 hours) for
the measurement of levels of melatonin, total fatty acids,
glucose, and lactic acid (26, 32).
MCF-7 tumor xenografts development in nude mice
Ovariectomized athymic nude mice (4–5-week-old females)
were obtained from Charles River and maintained in pathogenfree aseptic conditions with phytoestrogen-free food and water
ad libitum. All mice were supplemented with estrogen pellets
(0.72 mg of 17b-estradiol 60-day release from Innovative
Research of America) and estradiol-dependent MCF-7 xenografts were propagated. Exponentially growing MCF-7 cells
(Passage numbers 18–20) were harvested and approximately
5  106 MCF-7 cells in 150 mL of PBS-Matrigel mixture were
orthotopically and bilaterally implanted into the mammary fat
pads of female nude mice, as previously described (32).
Tumor transplantation into athymic nude rats
After one week of photoperiod acclamation (LD 12:12 or
dLEN for study I: dLEN or dLEN þ nighttime melatonin
supplementation for study II), nude rats were implanted in
a tissue-isolated fashion with (ERaþ) MCF-7 human tumor
xenografts obtained from the tumor xenografts initially developed in mice, as described previously (24, 26, 31). Once
implanted tissue-isolated tumor xenografts reached a palpable
size (approximately pea size) in the nude rats, tumors were
measured every day for estimated tumor weights, as described
previously (24, 27, 31).
Tumor growth studies
Two separate approaches to evaluate the effects of dLEN and
melatonin on the responsiveness of breast tumor xenografts to
4OH-TAM were used as shown in Fig. 1. In study I, tissueisolated (ERaþ) MCF-7 human breast tumor xenografts were
implanted into nude rats maintained in a control LD 12:12
(elevated endogenous nocturnal melatonin) lighting schedule

rats were acclimated in a standard LD 12:12 lighting schedule for
one week after which half were switched to either dLEN or kept on LD
12:12 lighting cycles. 1, after one week of acclamation to appropriate
lighting cycles, arterial blood was collected at two circadian time points
(mid-light and mid-dark phase) and measured for melatonin. 2, tissueisolated breast tumor xenografts were implanted into rats housed in LD

4OH-TAM was initiated as tumors in each lighting schedule reached an
estimated weight of 2.5 g. 4, as tumors reached 8 g (estimated weight),
regressed to half their weight (approximately 1.5 g), or reached 40 days
posttumor implantation, arterial and venous blood were collected for
tumor metabolic analysis and tumors were harvested and snap frozen in
liquid nitrogen for protein analysis. In study II (lower track), rats were

or in a dLEN (suppressed nocturnal melatonin) schedule. In
study II, all nude rats were maintained in a dLEN schedule with
or without melatonin supplementation at night. In each study,
once tumors reached an estimated weight of 2.5 g, rats were
treated with 4OH-TAM (80 mg/kg/d) or vehicle until tumors
regressed to approximately 1.5 g, until they grew to an estimated weight of 8 g, or until 40 days postimplantation. At the
appropriate times, tumors were freeze clamped with liquid
nitrogen and stored at 80 C until they were used for analyses.
Study I
When tumor weights reached approximately 2.5 g estimated
weight, one half of the animals (n ¼ 3/group) maintained in
either the dLEN lighting or LD 12:12 lighting environments
were treated daily at 16:00 hours with 0.1 mL of 4OH-TAM
(Sigma-Aldrich) solution (80 mg/kg/d) via intraperitoneal
injection. The second group of animals was maintained in
these lighting environments (n ¼ 3/group) and injected with
vehicle. Thus, there were four experimental groups in this
study: group 1 (dLEN controls); group II (dLEN treated with
tamoxifen); group III (LD 12:12, controls); and group IV (LD
12:12 treated with tamoxifen).
Study II
All animals were maintained in the dLEN lighting schedule
and were randomized so that half received a vehicle at nighttime and the other half received a supplement of melatonin in
their nighttime drinking water (0.1 mg/mL) such that they
received approximately 2.5 mg melatonin daily intake, based on
a daily water intake of about 25 mL, which simulates the high
normal nighttime physiologic levels of melatonin. When tumor

weights reached approximately 2.5 g estimated weight, one half
of the animals (n ¼ 3/group) maintained in either the dLEN
lighting or dLEN supplemented with melatonin were treated
daily at 16:00 hours with either 0.1 mL of 4OH-TAM (80 mg/kg/d)
or diluent by intraperitoneal injection. Thus this study consisted of four groups: group I (dLEN treated with vehicle);
group II (dLEN treated with tamoxifen); group III (dLEN
supplemented with melatonin and treated with vehicle); and
group IV (dLEN supplemented with melatonin and treated
with tamoxifen).
A-V tumor measurements
When tumors reached an estimated weight of 8 g, (groups I,
II, and III), were out 40 days pastimplantation, or regressed to
1.6 g (group IV) following tamoxifen-administration, tumors
were prepared for in situ tumor vein cannulation (31). Experiments were conducted between 24:00 and 04:00 hours following a normal nocturnal feeding period. Animal preparation,
including anesthesia administration and blood sample collection, was described previously (24, 27, 31). Analysis of arterial
glucose, lactate, acid/gas, fatty acids, and melatonin was
conducted as previously described (30).
Tumor lysate extraction and Western blot analysis
Frozen tumors were pulverized and homogenized in RIPA
buffer (1  PBS, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma
Scientiﬁc) and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails. Total tumor
protein was isolated from tumor lysates as previously
described (28) and aliquots stored at 80 C. One hundred
and twenty micrograms of protein from each sample were
separated on a criterion precast gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad). After incubation
with 5% nonfat milk in TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, immunoblot analyses were probed with various antibodies, including
cleaved caspase-3, phospho- (p)-ERK1/2 Thr202/Tyr204, total
(t)-ERK1/2, p-AKT Ser473, t-AKT, p-NF-kB Ser536, t-NF-kB, pSRC Tyr416, t-SRC, p-FAK Tyr576/577, t-FAK, p-CREB Ser133,
t-CREB, p-STAT3 Tyr707 and t-STAT3, and LC3BI and LC3BII,
from Cell Signaling Technology. For analysis of p-ERa, antibodies for p-ERa Ser118 and Ser167 (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.),
and ERa (Novocastra Laboratories) were used. The blots were
stripped and reprobed with anti–b-actin antibody (Sigma) to
evaluate loading. Quantitation of Western blot analyses and
differences in expression of total and phosphorylated proteins
were determined by digital quantitation of phosphorylated and
total protein levels and normalizing phosphorylated levels to
the levels of the total protein of interest and comparing the
levels of tamoxifen treated, LD 12:12, dLEN þ melatonin in the
presence or absence of tamoxifen, to the dLEN control to
determine the percentage or fold change.
Statistical analysis
Data are represented as the mean  SD, unless otherwise
indicated. Statistical differences between mean values in the
LEN-exposed group versus the control group at circadian time
points were assessed by the Student t test. Statistical differences among group means in tumor perfusion studies were

determined by a one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni
multiple comparison test. Differences in the tumor growth
rates among groups were determined by regression analyses
and tests for parallelism (Student t test). Differences were
considered to be statistically signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.

Results
Study I
Plasma melatonin levels. Figure 2A shows that under
LD 12:12 conditions, before tamoxifen treatment, plasma
melatonin levels increased and remained high during the
dark phase reaching a peak at 24:00 hours that was more
than 70-fold higher than during the light phase. In rats under
dLEN lighting schedule, melatonin levels remained consistently low to undetectable throughout the 24-hour period
(Fig. 2B).
dLEN promotes tumor growth and intrinsic resistance to
4OH-TAM in (ERaþ) MCF-7 tissue-isolated breast tumor
xenografts. Figure 3A shows that breast tumor xenografts
from rats housed in dLEN had a signiﬁcantly reduced (P <
0.001) latency-to-onset and a signiﬁcantly faster (P < 0.001)
growth rate (2.6-fold, 0.73 g/d) compared with tumor xenografts grown under the LD 12:12 lighting schedule (0.28 g/d).
Tumors from rats in dLEN showed complete intrinsic resistance to tamoxifen growing at the same rate (0.69 g/d) as
vehicle-treated xenografts in dLEN. However, late afternoon
(16:00 hours/4:00 pm) administration of tamoxifen signiﬁcantly inhibited (P < 0.001) tumor growth in rats housed in
LD 12:12 as tumors regressed at a rate of 0.14 g/d. Figure
3A also shows visually the dynamic difference in tumor
growth and regression between xenografts from dLEN with
our without melatonin supplementation and LD 12:12
groups treated with tamoxifen.
Tumor cAMP levels. Tumor cAMP levels were 14- and 20fold higher at the mid-dark phase in rats in vehicle- and
tamoxifen-treated dLEN rats, respectively, as compared with
the same treatment groups on LD 12:12 (Table 1). Administration of 4OH-TAM to rats in dLEN did not affect tumor cAMP
levels; however, in LD 12:12, it further diminished tumor
cAMP levels by 40% as compared with vehicle-treated animals.
Tumor linoleic acid uptake, 13-HODE production, and
proliferative activity. Tumor linoleic acid (LA) uptake and
13-HODE formation were completely suppressed during the
mid-dark phase in both vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated rats on
LD 12:12, while high levels of tumor LA metabolism were seen
in both vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated rats maintained on
dLEN (Table 1). In addition, tumor incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA in vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated dLEN
rats was elevated by 10-fold at the mid-dark phase as compared
with vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated rats on LD 12:12, respectively. No difference was observed between vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated groups in both photoperiods.
Warburg effect - tumor glucose and O2 uptakes, and lactic
acid and CO2 production. Tumor glucose and O2 uptake
were increased by 2- and 1.5-fold, respectively, at 24:00 hours
(mid-dark phase) in vehicle-treated dLEN rats as compared
with vehicle-treated rats on the standard LD 12:12 photo-

tumors.
Modulation of key proliferation and survival signaling
molecules in breast tumor xenografts exposed to dLEN or
nighttime melatonin treated with 4OH-TAM. Tumors from
animals in dLEN treated with vehicle or tamoxifen, harvested
at 24:00 hours (mid-dark phase, subjective night) showed high
levels of ERK1/2 phospho-activation, whereas tumors from
animals in LD 12:12 with elevated nighttime melatonin showed
almost complete suppression of ERK1/2 phospho-activation
(Fig. 5A). No change in AKT, either total or phosphorylated
at ser473 (p-AKTS473) or NF-kB/p65, was observed in response
to dLEN or LD 12:12 in either the presence or absence of
tamoxifen.
Tumors from dLEN groups (vehicle or tamoxifen treated)
also showed elevated levels of p-SRC and p-FAK at sites Y416
and Y576/577, respectively, but repression of the phosphoactive forms was seen in LD 12:12 tumors (Fig. 5A). The levels of
p-STAT3 (Y705) were also elevated in dLEN tumors treated
with vehicle or tamoxifen, but were almost completely inhibited in LD 12:12 tumors (vehicle and tamoxifen treated). Figure
5A shows cAMP—responsive element binding protein (CREB),
a transcription factor phospho-activated by cAMP/PKA and
upregulated in many breast tumors (33–35), is phospho-activated in dLEN tumors treated with or without tamoxifen, but

dLEN activation and melatonin repression of ERa phosphorylation and activation. Elevated phosphorylation of
Ser118 and Ser167 of the ERa was observed in tumors from
the dLEN group without signiﬁcant change in total ERa

groups.
Study II
Plasma melatonin levels in study II. Melatonin levels
remained low throughout the 24-hour period in rats under the
dLEN lighting schedule before melatonin and/or tamoxifen
treatment. As shown in Fig. 2B, following administration of
melatonin in the drinking water (2.5 mg/d) plasma melatonin
levels at 24:00 hours (mid-dark phase/subjective night) were
70- to 90-fold more than at 12:00 hours in control (dLEN) rats,
respectively.
dLEN promotes tumor growth and intrinsic resistance to
4OH-TAM in (ERaþ) MCF-7 tissue-isolated breast tumor
xenografts. Figure 3B demonstrates that (ERþ) MCF-7
breast tumor xenografts from rats housed in dLEN had a
signiﬁcantly shorter (P < 0.001) latency-to-onset and a significantly increased growth rate (2.2-fold) compared with tumors
in rats in dLEN that were supplemented with exogenous
melatonin at night. Tumor xenografts from rats in dLEN
showed complete intrinsic resistance to 4OH-TAM, growing
at the same rate as vehicle-treated dLEN xenografts. Tumor
xenografts from rats in dLEN supplemented with nighttime
melatonin shows visually the dramatic response (P < 0.0001)
to 4OH-TAM administered at 16:00 hours (4:00 pm), regressing

(mid-dark phase) from three animals in each group. Total cell lysates (120 mg of protein/sample) from tumors were analyzed by Western blotting for expression
of cleaved caspase-3 (A and B) or conversion of LC3BI to LC3BII by lipidation (C). b-Actin was used as a control for equal loading.

dLEN groups.
Tumor cAMP levels. Table 3 shows that tumor cAMP
concentrations at 24:00 hours in dLEN animals given either
vehicle or tamoxifen were 10- and 27-fold higher, respectively,
than in the same treatment groups in dLEN rats supplemented
with nighttime melatonin. In rats in dLEN supplemented with
melatonin, tamoxifen administration further decreased tumor
cAMP levels by 63% compared with vehicle controls.
Tumor linoleic acid uptake, 13-HODE production, and
proliferative activity. Table 3 shows elevated levels of
tumor LA uptake and 13-HODE formation at 24:00 hours
(mid-dark phase) in both dLEN groups (vehicle and tamoxifen treated) without melatonin supplementation. However,
uptake of LA and its conversion to 13-HODE were completely suppressed at 24:00 hours in dLEN groups supplemented
with nighttime melatonin. Furthermore, incorporation of
[3H]-thymidine into the DNA of dLEN tumors, both vehicleand 4OH-TAM treated, was elevated by 10-fold compared
with the same treatment groups in dLEN tumors and
supplemented with melatonin.
Warburg effect: tumor glucose and O2 uptakes, and lactic
acid and CO2 production. In Table 4, tumor glucose and O2
uptake increased by 2.8- and 1.3-fold and 2.3- and 3.4-fold, in
vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated dLEN rats, respectively, as
compared with the same treatment groups from dLEN melatonin-supplemented tumors. Also, tumor lactate and CO2
production increased by 2.7- and 1.8-fold and 1.3- and 2.9-fold

versus vehicle- and tamoxifen-treated dLEN melatonin-supplemented rats.
Modulation of apoptosis and autophagy in breast tumor
xenografts exposed to dLEN or nighttime melatonin and
treated with 4OH-TAM. Caspase-3 cleavage, a marker of
apoptosis, was increased by 15% and 23% in dLEN melatonin-supplemented tumors treated with vehicle or 4OH-TAM,
respectively, compared with the same treatment groups in
dLEN tumors without melatonin supplementation (Fig. 4B).
Furthermore, an increase in the conversion of LC3BI (upper
band) to LC3BII (lower band) is observed in dLEN melatoninsupplemented tumors treated with vehicle or 4OH-TAM versus
xenografts compared with dLEN tumors treated with vehicle or
4OH-TAM (Fig. 4C).
Modulation of key proliferation and survival signaling
molecules in breast tumor xenografts exposed to dLEN or
nighttime melatonin treated with 4OH-TAM. In study II,
dLEN tumors treated with diluent or 4OH-TAM showed high
levels of phospho-active ERK1/2, SRC, FAK, STAT3, and CREB
(Fig. 5B) and modest, but consistent, induction of phosphoactive AKTS473. A large and consistent increase in t-NF-kB/p65
but not p-NF-kB/p65 was observed in dLEN tumors treated
with vehicle or 4OH-TAM. Conversely, the corresponding
treatment groups in dLEN melatonin-supplemented tumors
showed almost complete suppression of p-ERK1/2, p-AKT, pSRC, p-FAK, p-STAT3, and p-CREB, and a signiﬁcant reduction
of t-NF-kB/p65 was also observed.

at Ser118 and 167 by 68% and 76%, respectively.

Discussion
Unlike exposure to bright light at night, which both

only melatonin production while normal SCN-driven circadian feeding and drinking activity persist (24). In these
studies, dLEN was at a light intensity of 0.2 lux, which is
equivalent to a crack of light under a door in a completely
dark room. As shown in study I, female nude rats on LD 12:12
lighting schedule evinced a circadian rhythm of plasma
melatonin, that closely mimics the normal melatonin circadian proﬁle in adult human female subjects (26, 31),
whereas dLEN only suppressed the nocturnal melatonin
signal as we previously reported (24, 26). Study II demonstrated that supplementation of the drinking water with

in vitro work (29) and demonstrate that the loss of the
nocturnal circadian melatonin signal, in response to dLENinduced circadian/melatonin disruption, is an underlying and
novel mechanism for the development of intrinsic resistance to
tamoxifen therapy.
We anticipated that the tumor regression driven by the
combination of melatonin and 4OH-TAM would be associated
with signiﬁcant increases in apoptosis and autophagy. However, only moderate increases in apoptosis and autophagy were
observed at the mid-dark phase time point, which do not

melatonin is an effective replacement strategy for reconstituting nighttime levels of melatonin in dLEN rats.
This study clearly demonstrates that under dLEN conditions, latency-to-tumor onset was shortened while the growth
of tumors and their development of intrinsic tamoxifen resistance were stimulated. Conversely, in the presence of the
endogenous nocturnal melatonin signal or in response to
exposure to melatonin at night under dLEN conditions, tumor
latency-to-onset was prolonged while tamoxifen resistance
was negated, resulting in tumor regression. These in vivo
studies demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that the presence of

correlate well with the rapid rates of tumor regression
observed. Thus, it is likely that apoptosis and autophagy are
increased at other circadian time points, and/or that the
degree of tumor regression induced by the combination of
tamoxifen and melatonin is mediated by multiple mechanisms,
including apoptosis, autophagy, and diminished cell proliferative activity.
Although the evolving list of mechanisms by which melatonin inhibits human breast cancer growth includes the inhibition of multiple signaling, transcriptional and metabolic
pathways, the mechanism(s) by which this indoleamine
increases breast cancer responsiveness to tamoxifen is
unknown. Elucidating this mechanism(s) is essential for understanding how dLEN-induced melatonin suppression promotes
breast cancer growth progression and tamoxifen resistance.
With respect to breast cancer metabolism, melatonin suppresses the metabolism of glucose via the inhibition of aerobic
glycolysis (Warburg effect) as well as the uptake of LA and its
metabolism to its mitogenic end product 13-HODE. Both of
these processes, which are linked to key signaling pathways for
cell proliferation/survival, are important in supplying both the
energetics and infrastructure involved in building tumor biomass (35). We recently reported (36) that in human breast
cancer xenografts LA metabolism, the Warburg effect, their
associated cell signaling pathways, and cell proliferative activity exhibit robust melatonin-driven circadian rhythms characterized by suppressed activity during the night and peak
activity during the day in human breast cancer xenografts.
Numerous studies have linked the activation of ERK/12, AKT,
NF-kB, cAMP SRC, STAT-3, and IL6 to the potentiation of the
Warburg effect in various tumor types (37–39). Because some
of these same pathways were phospho-activated in response to
dLEN in the present studies, it is possible that dLEN may have
ampliﬁed the Warburg effect through upregulation of phos-

4108

Cancer Res; 74(15) August 1, 2014

pho-active ERK1/2, cAMP, SRC, and IL6. On the basis of the fact
that the Warburg effect can drive some tumors to chemoresistance (40), it is conceivable that dLEN may drive breast
cancer to intrinsic resistance to tamoxifen via constitutive
activation of the Warburg effect.
On the other hand, in animals exposed to LD 12:12, with an
intact endogenous melatonin signal, or to dLEN and receiving
melatonin-replacement therapy, it is also possible that the
rapid tumor regression observed in response to 4OH-TAM
therapy can be primarily ascribed to inhibition of key proliferative and survival signaling pathways. Our results clearly
demonstrate that the nocturnal exposure to melatonin dramatically suppresses or ablates the expression of total or
phospho-activated ERK1/2, AKT, cAMP, SRC, FAK, STAT3,
CREB, and NF-kB. Numerous reports have described the
importance of each of these pathways, either individually or
collectively, in driving breast cancer toward proliferation,
progression, and tamoxifen resistance (41, 42). The potential
importance of melatonin as a natural endogenous nighttime
inhibitor of the pERK1/2, p-SRC, p-FAK, and p-STAT3 pathways is supported by the work of Hiscox and colleagues (43)
showing that inhibition of c-SRC suppresses the expression of
cyclin D1 and c-Myc, and thus inhibits the emergence of a
tamoxifen-resistant phenotype in breast cancer cell lines.
Future studies employing multiple circadian time points will
be required to determine the precise temporal sequence of
kinase and transcription factor phosphorylation in deﬁning
the efﬁcacy of endocrine therapies, depending on the timing of
their administration.
It is important to note that STAT3 is regarded as a point of
convergence for many oncogenic signals and its aberrant
constitutive activity is crucial for the survival, proliferation,
and metastatic activity of tumors of different origins (44).
Moreover, STAT3 activity can be driven by activation of

ERK1/2, SRC, and FAK, all of which are activated by dLEN.
STAT3, in turn, induces the expression of various genes
involved in tumor promotion and progression, including Myc
and cyclin D1 (43). Furthermore, activation of STAT3 promotes
a feed-forward loop involving continuous production of the
proinﬂammatory cytokine IL6 and activation of NF-kB (45).
Supporting a report by Alvarez-Garcia and colleagues (46),
analysis of tissue-isolated breast tumor xenografts from rats in
a LD 12:12 lighting schedule showed a signiﬁcant 80% reduction in IL6 mRNA expression at night as compared with those
in dLEN (data not shown). Thus, the ability of melatonin to
inhibit p-STAT3 levels in these breast cancer xenografts could
result from either suppression of c-SRC/FAK phospho-activation, IL6 expression, or both, to inhibit cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and endocrine resistance.
Our studies also suggest that ERa phosphorylation and
transactivation is circadian regulated by the nocturnal melatonin signal and that dLEN-induced melatonin suppression is
associated with elevated phosphorylation of the ERa at S118
and S167 and possibly involved in tamoxifen resistance. These
data combined with our reports (47) and that of others (48) that
melatonin inhibits ERa transcriptional activity, and our
unpublished data in cell lines that EGF or insulin—like growth
factor-I stimulates phosphorylation of ERa at both Ser118
and Ser167, and that melatonin administration can inhibit
this phosphorylation suggests that melatonin regulates ERa
transcriptional activity through a phosphorylation-mediated
mechanism.
In conclusion, the present investigation highlights and
validates the importance of an intact endogenous nocturnal
circadian melatonin signal in sensitizing human breast tumor
cells to tamoxifen therapy. Given that nighttime melatonin
signiﬁcantly suppresses tumor kinase signaling; one could
consider melatonin a broadly based "circadian-regulated
kinase inhibitor" (CRKI) that exhibits potent antimetabolic,
-proliferative, and progression/metastatic activity in breast
cancer. Moreover, our work demonstrates that a comprehensive understanding and maintenance of host/cancer circadian
biology and the circadian-regulated nature of cancer metabolism and signaling are essential to derive the maximal efﬁcacy
from tamoxifen and possibly other endocrine therapies. In this

regard, the maximal efﬁcacy of such therapies would seem to
be dependent on their optimal temporal administration in
alignment with the circadian timing in LD entrained patients
or with exogenous melatonin in patients with LEN-induced
circadian/melatonin disruption. It is plausible that many, if
not all, patients with breast cancer are likely to be subjected
to various degrees of LEN and may be circadian/melatonin
disrupted as a result of lack of sleep, and/or chronic late
night shift work. Therefore, LEN may represent a unique and
previously unappreciated risk factor that could account for
some forms of intrinsic and possibly acquired tamoxifen
resistance and may even lead to a shortened survival time
and even a decreased survival rate.
