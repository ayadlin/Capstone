Abstract
Proteasome inhibitors (PI), a novel class of anticancer drugs,
are relatively well tolerated and have recently been introduced
into the clinic for the treatment of multiple myeloma. The
tumor selectivity and low toxicity of PIs are surprising, given
the crucial role of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in a
multitude of cellular processes. Here, we show that systemic
administration of PIs specifically impairs the ubiquitin/
proteasome system in growth plate chondrocytes. Importantly, young mice displayed severe growth retardation during
treatment as well as 45 days after the cessation of treatment
with clinically relevant amounts of MG262 (0.2 Mmol/kg body
weight/injection) or bortezomib (1.0 mg/kg body weight/
injection). Dysfunction of the ubiquitin/proteasome system
was accompanied by the induction of apoptosis of stem-like
and proliferative chondrocytes in the growth plate. These
results were recapitulated in cultured fetal rat metatarsal
bones and chondrocytic cell lines (rat, human). Apoptosis was
associated with up-regulation of the proapoptotic molecules,
p53 and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), both in vitro and
in vivo. In addition to the observation that AIF is expressed in
the growth plate, we also provide evidence that AIF serves as a
direct target protein for ubiquitin, thus explaining its
prominent up-regulation upon proteasome inhibition. Suppression of p53 or AIF expression with small interfering RNAs
partly rescued chondrocytes from proteasome inhibition–
induced apoptosis (35% and 41%, respectively). Our observations show that proteasome inhibition may selectively target
essential cell populations in the growth plate causing significant growth failure. These findings could have important
implications for the use of proteasome inhibitors in the treatment of childhood cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;67(20):10078–86]

Introduction
Longitudinal bone growth takes place in the growth plate, a thin
layer of cartilage localized at each end of the long bones. The
growth plate is mainly composed of chondrocytes and could be
morphologically and functionally divided into three different zones:

resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic. Resting zone chondrocytes,
also known as stem-like chondrocytes (1, 2), are stimulated to
proliferate and undergo hypertrophy, a process which involves
several stages of maturation (3). Disturbed chondrocyte activity,
either due to disruption in normal cell division or excessive cell
death, may lead to defective longitudinal bone growth. Survivors of
childhood cancer often have severe long-term complications
secondary to previously administered life-saving treatment, emphasizing the importance of minimizing these undesired effects.
The proteasome is a large proteolytic complex that resides in the
nucleus and cytosol of all eukaryotic cells. The selectivity of the
system is safeguarded by the small protein modifier ubiquitin,
which is covalently conjugated to proteins destined for proteasomal degradation. The proteasome preferentially binds and
degrades ubiquitinated proteins (4). The critical involvement of
the ubiquitin/proteasome system in the regulation of a number of
cellular processes, as well as protein quality control, suggests that
compounds or conditions that interfere with this process would be
inherently toxic to eukaryotic cells. In vitro experiments confirm
this notion as cells undergo apoptosis when cultured in the
presence of proteasome inhibitors, making these agents attractive
candidates for cancer therapy (5). Presently, there are five major
classes of specific proteasome inhibitors: peptide aldehydes,
peptide vinyl sulfones, peptide boronates, peptide epoxyketones,
and h-lactones. Only recently, bortezomib (also known as PS341 or
Velcade), a boronate proteasome inhibitor, was approved as a
third-line agent in the treatment of multiple myeloma because of
its profound antitumor effect (6), which was also documented in a
clinical phase 1 trial in children (7). The most prevalent side effects
of proteasome inhibitors, thrombocytopenia and peripheral
neuropathy, are only observed in a minority of treated patients
(8). However, there is no previous information available on any
specific side effects of proteasome inhibitors in young, rapidly
growing individuals. The molecular mechanism for proteasome
inhibitor–induced cell death of cancer cells remains enigmatic and
it is therefore difficult to anticipate which somatic cells may be at
risk during treatment with proteasome inhibitors. To address this,
the effects of two highly selective boronate proteasome inhibitors,
MG262 (9) and bortezomib (7, 8), were analyzed in young mice. A
transgenic reporter mouse model for the ubiquitin/proteasome
system was used to monitor the in vivo proteasome inhibition. Our
studies revealed functional impairment of ubiquitin-dependent
proteasomal degradation in growth plate chondrocytes. Using
these transgenic mice, as well as cell lines and metatarsal organ
cultures as model systems, evidence for the role of caspasedependent and -independent induction of apoptosis in chondrocytes upon proteasome inhibition has been observed. Importantly,
severe growth retardation was seen in mice treated with the

proteasome inhibitors MG262 and bortezomib. These novel
findings may have considerable implications for the clinical use
of proteasome inhibitors in patients with cancer.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Proteasome inhibitors, MG262 (Biomol International,
SMS-gruppen) and lactacystin, flourochrome calcein, and p53 inhibitor
(pifithrin-a) were from Sigma-Aldrich, and pan-caspase inhibitor z-VADfmk was from R&D Systems. Bortezomib (Velcade) from Janssen-Cilag AB,
was dissolved in saline. Trypsin, PBS, EDTA, fetal bovine serum, MEMa and
DMEM/F12 medium were from Invitrogen.
Animal studies. All animal studies were approved by the local ethical
committee. Five-week-old male B6 mice were given four injections of
MG262 (0.2 Amol/kg body weight/injection) in 10 days, and then killed after
48 h or 45 days (Fig. 1A). The tibia and femur were excised and measured
with a digital caliper, and growth velocity was determined as previously
described (ref. 10; Fig. 1A). In a separate experiment, 5-week-old male
ubiquitinG76V-green fluorescent protein (UbG76V-GFP)/2 transgenic mice
(see ref. 11 for details) were given three injections of MG262 (0.2 Amol/kg
body weight/injection) in 5 days, and were killed 24 h after the last injection
and analyzed for accumulation of GFP reporter in different tissues. For the
long-term effects, two more strains of 5-week-old male mice, C57B and
NMRI, were treated with bortezomib (1.0 mg/kg body weight, two injections
per week, 2 weeks treatment; ref. 12) and tibia length was measured at
sacrifice, 45 days after the last injection. Serum levels of insulin-like growth
factor I were measured using a commercial RIA kit (Mediadiagnostic).
Proteasome activity in blood was assessed as described previously (13).
Quantitative histology of the growth plate. Histomorphometry
was done as described previously by us (14). In each tissue sample, 15
measurements of growth plate height were taken. Column density was
determined as the number of chondrocyte columns per millimeter of growth
plate. All measurements were done by a person blinded to the experimental
details.
Organ cultures. Fetal rat metatarsal bones were cultured and monitored
as described previously (15).
Cell cultures. The human chondrocytic cell line, HCS-2/8 (16) was
cultured as recently described by us (17). The RCJ3.1C5.18 rat chondrogenic
cell line (C5.18) was maintained in MEMa medium and supplemented with
ascorbic acid and h-glycerophosphate as described previously (18, 19). After
4 to 7 days of culture, the cells acquire markers of early chondrocytic
differentiation and progressively acquire markers of terminal differentiation
at 7 to 10 and 10 to 14 days of culture (19, 20).
Alcian blue staining. Nodule formation, which is a chondrocyte
differentiation marker in C5.18 chondrocytes (early differentiated and
differentiated/late differentiated cells), was confirmed with 5% Alcian blue
staining as described previously (ref. 21; Supporting Fig. S7).
Cell death detection ELISA and caspase-3 activity. Apoptosis was
studied with the detection and quantification of cytoplasmic histoneassociated DNA fragments (17) and caspase-3 activity was determined as
described previously (22).
Western blot analysis. Western immunoblotting was done as described
previously by us (17). The primary antibodies against p53 (1:1,000), MDM-2
(1:1,000), Bax (1:1,000), PARP (1:1,000), and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF;
1:1,500), ubiquitin (P4D1; 1:1,000) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For
immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed in a radioimmunoprecipitation assay
buffer containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH)
and 1 mmol/L of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Supernatants were
incubated with AIF antibody at 4jC for 2 h followed by the addition of
protein G-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Bioscience). After overnight
incubation, the resulting immunocomplexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE.
In situ apoptosis and cell proliferation. Apoptotic cells were detected
by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling
and cell proliferation was assessed as described previously (23).
Immunohistochemistry. Antigen retrieval was done in citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) containing 0.01% Tween 20 for 15 min at 94jC to 96jC. The
sections were incubated with 10% normal serum for 1 h, primary antibody

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

at 4jC overnight, secondary antibodies conjugated with immunofluorescent
dyes (Alexa 488 and Alexa 546; Molecular Probes, Inc.) for 1 h at room
temperature and finally counterstained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
for 15 min. Immunostaining with PC10 primary antibody (1:1,600) against
proliferating cell nuclear antigens (Abcam) was done to study chondrocyte
proliferation.
Small interfering RNAs. C5.18 cells (3  103 cells in 96-well plates or
5  104 cells in six-well plates) were transfected with a small interfering
RNA (siRNA) doubled-stranded oligonucleotide designed (QIAGEN) to
interfere with the expression of rat p53: sense, r(CGU ACU CAA UUU CCC
UCA A) dTdT; antisense, r(UUG AGG GAA AUU GAG UAC G) dTdG; and to
AIF, sense, r(GGG UAA AUG CAG AGC UUC A) dTdT; antisense, r(UGA AGC
UCU GCA UUU ACC C) dGdG. Scrambled siRNA was used as negative
controls.
Statistical analysis. Results are presented as mean values F SE.
Differences between the groups were tested by one-way ANOVA followed by
the Newman-Keuls post-test.

Results
Systemic administration of a proteasome inhibitor causes
functional impairment of the ubiquitin/proteasome system in
chondrocytes. First, we evaluated the in vivo effect of proteasome
inhibition using a reporter mouse model for the ubiquitin/
proteasome system (11). These mice express UbG76V-GFP, which
is constitutively targeted for ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal
degradation by the presence of an ubiquitin fusion degradation
signal. Tissues from these mice thus display low GFP fluorescence
unless the cells, as a consequence of functional impairment of the
ubiquitin/proteasome system, fail to degrade the UbG76V-GFP
proteasome substrate.
Five-week-old male UbG76V-GFP/2 mice received i.p. injections
(Fig. 1A) of 0.2 Amol MG262/kg body weight on days 1, 3, and 5 and
were killed 24 h after the final injection. After screening multiple
tissues, we observed the accumulation of the UbG76V-GFP
proteasome substrate in the femur and tibia growth plate cartilage
(Fig. 1). The strongest GFP accumulation was detected in resting
zone chondrocytes in both the tibia (Fig. 1B) and femur
(Supporting Fig. S1A) growth plates. A similar response was seen
in articular cartilage from both the tibia (Fig. 1C) and femur
(Supporting Fig. S2B). In addition, we found some increase in the
reporter levels in bone marrow of MG262-treated mice (Fig. 1D).
We have previously shown that administration of a single high dose
of MG262 (1 Amol/kg body weight) triggered a very strong
accumulation of the GFP reporter in the liver and pancreas (11).
However, we did not detect increased levels of UbG76V-GFP in the
liver and pancreas of mice that had been given three low-dose
injections of MG262 (0.2 Amol/kg body weight/injection), which
suggests that chronic exposure affects the tissues differentially
(Supporting Fig. S2). Whereas other conventional chemotherapeutics often have a general effect on proliferative tissues, we did not
detect functional impairment of the ubiquitin/proteasome system
in the small intestine and testis, two tissues that are known to have
high indices of proliferation (Supporting Fig. S2A). Thus, MG262
displays an atypical tissue targeting primarily affecting selective
populations of cells located in the growth plate, articular cartilage,
and bone marrow.
Proteasome inhibition causes severe and sustained growth
retardation in young mice. Our data in transgenic mice showing
that MG262 causes selective accumulation of the GFP reporter in
stem-like growth plate chondrocytes suggested that proteasome
inhibitors might affect bone growth. To address this, mice were
treated with multiple injections of MG262. We found that mice

treated with MG262 had significantly shorter femurs and tibias
(Fig. 2A) and a 20% to 25% decrease in growth velocity when
assessed over the 10-day period of treatment (Fig. 2C). Proteasome
activity was also significantly decreased in whole blood lysates,
confirming systemic proteasome inhibition (data not shown).
Moreover, MG262 significantly increased apoptosis in stem-like and
proliferative zone chondrocytes (P < 0.001; Fig. 3B) and decreased
proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression throughout the growth
plate (P < 0.05; Supporting Fig. S3). Quantitative histologic analysis
of the growth plate revealed a decrease in growth plate height
(Fig. 3C) and total number of chondrocyte columns in MG262treated mice (Fig. 3D).
During treatment with MG262, food intake (3.9 F 0.2 versus
4.2 F 0.2 g/d in vehicle) and body weight (21.64 F 2.1 versus
23.01 F 2.7 g/animal in vehicle) were not significantly affected.
Also, 45 days after the treatment with MG262 was terminated, food
intake (3.7 F 0.3 versus 3.7 F 0.1 g/d in vehicle) and body weight
(21.72 F 1.2 versus 22.9 F 1.1 g/animal in vehicle) were unaffected,
indicating that the MG262-induced growth retardation was not
secondary to metabolic effects or weight loss. Serum insulin-like
growth factor I was not affected when assessed 2 days (232 F 16
versus 246 F 14 ng/mL in vehicle) or 45 days (215.4 F 9.2 versus
213.6 F 5.2 ng/mL in vehicle) after the last injection of MG262,
further supporting the notion that the effect of proteasome inhibition on bone growth is not likely to be systemic but rather the
result of direct effects on the growth plate.
Strikingly, even 45 days after the last injection of MG262, the
bones of previously treated mice were still significantly shorter
(Fig. 2B) and displayed reduced growth velocity (Fig. 2D) compared
with vehicle-treated mice, further supporting the notion that the

growth dysfunction persisted over time. To exclude that the longterm negative effect on bone growth is compound and/or mouse
strain–specific, we treated both C57B and NMRI mice with
bortezomib. The control group was pair-fed as bortezomib might
affect food intake. Indeed, bortezomib in a clinically relevant
concentration (1.0 mg/kg body weight, two injections per week,
2 weeks treatment) caused long-term growth failure (tibia length
measured by digital caliper at sacrifice 45 days after last injection)
in both C57B (17.38 F 0.18 versus 18.66 F 0.38 mm in vehicle;
P < 0.001; n = 10) and NMRI (17.51 F 0.06 versus 18.53 F 0.09 mm
in vehicle; P < 0.001; n = 9) mice. The fact that proteasome
inhibition caused long-lasting negative effects on bone growth
suggests irreversible damage to cells in the growth plate rather
than transient cellular dysfunction.
Inhibition of proteasome triggers apoptosis of stem-like and
proliferative chondrocytes thereby causing severe growth
retardation. To further verify the direct effects of proteasome
inhibition on longitudinal bone growth, we cultured fetal rat
metatarsal bones and challenged them with different concentrations of the proteasome inhibitors, MG262 or lactacystin. When
treated for 12 days with MG262, a dose-dependent decrease in bone
growth was observed (Fig. 4A). Notably, even at the lowest
concentration of MG262 (0.3 Amol/L), a significant reduction in
bone growth was observed. Our in vivo data suggested a longlasting negative effect of bortezomib and MG262 on bone growth.
Interestingly, treatment of metatarsal bones with MG262 (1 Amol/L)
for 24 h resulted in permanent growth arrest and no catch-up
growth was observed when monitored up to 12 days, an effect
similar to what was observed in bones continuously exposed to the
proteasome inhibitor (Fig. 4A). To validate the findings observed

with MG262, we also used the natural proteasome inhibitor
lactacystin which also caused a dose-dependent decrease in
metatarsal bone growth confirming that proteasome inhibition,
indeed, directly targets bone growth (Supporting Fig. S4A). When
investigating the underlying mechanisms, we found that MG262
treatment caused a dramatic increase in apoptosis in resting (81 F
8% versus 0.5 F 0.0% in control; P < 0.001), proliferative (54 F 10%
versus 1.7 F 1.0% in control; P < 0.001) and hypertrophic (44 F 1%
versus 1.4 F 0.0% in control; P < 0.001) zone chondrocytes
(Supporting Fig. S5), whereas a significant reduction in bromodeoxyuridine staining was observed in resting (0.2 F 0.0% versus
8.4 F 1.0% in control, P < 0.001) and proliferative (0.0 F 0.0%
versus 11.9 F 2.0% in control, P < 0.001) zone chondrocytes.
Early-differentiated chondrocytes are more sensitive to
proteasome inhibition and apoptosis induction. Our detailed
in vivo and in vitro studies clearly suggested that stem-like
chondrocytes in the growth plate are more susceptible to
undergoing apoptosis upon proteasome inhibition compared with
proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes. To directly compare
the sensitivity of early differentiated cells (comparable to stem-like
chondrocytes) and late-differentiated cells (comparable to lateproliferative chondrocytes), we used the rat C5.18 chondrocytic cell
line. As observed in vivo and in cultured metatarsal bones, we
confirmed that MG262 induced apoptosis in C5.18 chondrocytes in
a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C and D). When compared with
late-differentiated cells, early-differentiated cells were more
sensitive to apoptosis when challenged with MG262 (Fig. 4C and
D). The difference was most striking at the earliest time point after
MG262 treatment (6 h) when there was no significant increase in
apoptosis in late-differentiated cells but an f2.5-fold increase in

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (20). October 15, 2007

apoptosis in early-differentiated cells. Measurements of caspase-3
activity confirmed that proteasome inhibitors induced apoptosis,
an effect which was observed earlier and was more pronounced in
early-differentiated cells when compared with late-differentiated
cells (Fig. 4B). MG262 also inhibited cell proliferation and
stimulated chondrocyte apoptosis in human chondrocytes (Supporting Fig. S6A and B) confirming that there are no species
differences related to this particular aspect of proteasome
inhibitors. Taken together, these data corroborate our findings
obtained in vivo and in cultured metatarsal bones, thus
demonstrating that early-differentiated cells are more sensitive to
proteasome inhibition.
Proteasome inhibition triggers caspase-dependent and
-independent apoptosis in chondrocytes. To investigate any
involvement of the caspase cascade on chondrocyte apoptosis and
longitudinal bone growth, metatarsal bones were cultured with the
pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk in combination with MG262.
Notably, although Z-VAD-fmk blocked dexamethasone-induced
reduction in metatarsal bone growth, this compound failed to
rescue growth in bones treated with MG262 (Supporting Fig. S4B),
suggesting the involvement of caspase-independent apoptosis.
However, we observed a tendency towards improved growth in
bones treated with the pan-caspase inhibitor, suggesting that
caspase activation may contribute to the overall effects of
proteasome inhibitors in this model (Supporting Fig. S4B). To
further verify the activation of caspase-dependent or -independent
apoptosis, we coincubated rat and human chondrocytes with ZVAD-fmk and MG262. These experiments showed that the pancaspase inhibitor partly prevented MG262-induced apoptosis in
both early- and late-differentiated rat chondrocytes (Fig. 4C and D)

Proteasome Inhibition Causes Severe Growth Retardation in Mice

and also in human chondrocytes (Supporting Fig. S6C). Altogether,
our data suggest that proteasome inhibition activates caspasedependent and -independent apoptosis in chondrocytes.
Genetic or pharmacologic targeting of p53 rescues chondrocytes from apoptosis induced by proteasome inhibition.
Next, we asked whether the deleterious effects of proteasome
inhibition in chondrocytes could be reversed or suppressed. The
tumor suppressor gene p53 plays an important role in the
regulation of apoptosis and its stability is controlled by the
ubiquitin/proteasome system. Therefore, we investigated whether
there was any effect of proteasome inhibition on p53 in growth
plate chondrocytes. Indeed, in mice treated with MG262, we found
increased p53 levels throughout the entire growth plate (Fig. 5A),
an effect which was verified in rat (Fig. 5B) and human (data not
shown) chondrocytes. Accumulation of p53 was observed as soon
as after 3 h in early-differentiated cells and after 12 h in latedifferentiated cells (Fig. 5B). The p53-regulated gene products,
Mdm-2 and Bax (data not shown), were also increased in parallel
with p53. Suppression of p53 expression using siRNAs resulted in a
35% decrease in apoptosis in MG262-treated cells (P < 0.005 versus
MG262 alone), indicating that p53 is involved in the induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 5C). In further support of this conclusion, we found
that the small molecule inhibitor of p53, pifithrin-a (24) also
suppressed MG262-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5C).
AIF is ubiquitinated and up-regulated through proteasome
inhibition in vitro and in vivo. We then decided to further
explore the mechanism(s) underlying caspase-independent apoptosis signaling in chondrocytes. To this end, we investigated the
role of AIF, a proapoptotic protein responsible for initiating
caspase-independent destruction of DNA and subsequent cell
death (25). We observed a strong up-regulation of AIF throughout
the growth plate in MG262-treated mice (Fig. 5A). These results
were further verified in rat chondrocytes in different stages of

differentiation, i.e., in early-differentiated, late-differentiated, and
hypertrophic cells. Indeed, AIF was found to be significantly upregulated after 12 and 24 h (Fig. 5D; data not shown for
hypertrophic chondrocytes). We hypothesized that AIF might act
as a target protein for ubiquitin, thus explaining its prominent upregulation upon proteasome inhibition. Indeed, we noted that AIF
was ubiquitinated both in cell culture and in the bones of mice
following the administration of MG262 (Fig. 5E). Finally, in support
of a role for AIF-mediated apoptotic cell death, suppression of AIF
with sequence-specific siRNAs decreased the apoptosis of rat
chondrocytes by 41% (P < 0.05 versus MG262 alone; Fig. 5E).

Discussion
We report the finding that systemic administration of proteasome inhibitors in mice specifically target the growth plate,
decrease growth velocity, and significantly impair further growth
potential. Using a wide array of experimental models, we have also
characterized the underlying mechanism. Here, we show that
proteasome inhibition triggers apoptosis in stem-like chondrocytes
in a caspase-dependent and -independent manner. Furthermore,
our preclinical data showing that inhibition of p53 and AIF
expression partly rescues chondrocytes from apoptosis could lead
to the prevention of growth failure induced by proteasome
inhibitors in patients.
Using a transgenic mouse model to monitor the in vivo status of
the proteasome system, we found that the ubiquitin/proteasome
system remained functional in liver and other proliferative tissues
(pancreas, testis, and colon) that are often affected by conventional
chemotherapy (26–29). The systemic administration of a proteasome inhibitor caused tissue-specific impairment of the ubiquitin/
proteasome system. Hence, accumulation of the reporter substrate
was observed only in cartilage within the long bones (growth plate

and articular cartilage) and bone marrow of proteasome inhibitor–
treated mice. Accumulation of the GFP reporter was evidenced
mainly in stem-like chondrocytes of the growth plate. The stem-like
chondrocytes are essential as this small population of cells give rise
to proliferative chondrocytes and provides the basis for normal
longitudinal bone growth. Indeed, we found that mice treated with
MG262 or bortezomib (clinically relevant dose; refs. 7, 8) resulted in
significant and permanent impairment of bone growth. Further

studies showed that the stem-like chondrocytes in the growth
plates of these mice are highly sensitive to apoptosis upon
proteasome inhibition. Experimental data in cultured rat metatarsal bones confirmed the sensitivity of stem-like chondrocytes to
apoptosis and showed that proteasome inhibitors act locally in the
growth plate to suppress longitudinal bone growth. Using cultured
human chondrocytes, we were able to reproduce the in vivo and
organ culture data showing massive chondrocyte apoptosis and

Proteasome Inhibition Causes Severe Growth Retardation in Mice

decreased cell proliferation after proteasome inhibition. Therefore,
we believe that our findings may be related to the clinical situation
in which pediatric patients might suffer from decreased growth
rate and reduced final height if treated with proteasome inhibitors.
Our finding that bone growth is negatively influenced by
proteasome inhibitors is supported by a recent report of decreased
growth in metatarsal bones cultured with the proteasome
inhibitor-I, an observation linked to its effects on hypertrophic
chondrocytes (30). In contrast, our data obtained both in vivo and
in vitro clearly show that proteasome inhibition targets stem-like
chondrocytes in the growth plate, and as a consequence, causes
significant growth failure. It should be pointed out that proteasome
inhibitor-I is not in clinical use and belongs to the peptide aldehyde
class of proteasome inhibitors which are less specific and also exert
nonspecific effects on the cell (9). In contrast, both bortezomib and
MG262 belong to the highly specific peptide boronate class of
proteasome inhibitors in which bortezomib has been approved for
the treatment of multiple myeloma and a phase 1 trial in children
was recently reported (6–8, 31).
Our current observation that a very short exposure to proteasome
inhibition is sufficient to cause permanent growth arrest is likely
explained by the induction of massive apoptosis in stem-like and
proliferative chondrocytes. These cell populations are essential for
bone elongation, especially during periods of rapid growth. Each
stem-like chondrocyte in the growth plate is believed to be
programmed to give rise to one chondrocyte column and have the
capacity to undergo a limited number of cell divisions (2).
Consequently, loss of stem-like chondrocytes will decrease the
number of chondrocyte columns and the total number of chondrocytes. In accordance, we observed decreases in the number of
columns and proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein expressions
in animals treated with the proteasome inhibitor. We also found
that proteasome inhibition impaired the ubiquitin/proteasome
system in articular cartilage, which is of particular clinical importance because excessive apoptosis in articular cartilage has been
linked to cartilage degeneration (32) and joint diseases (33).
Apoptosis is required for the sculpting of organs during
embryogenesis and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in the
adult; consequently, a deregulation of apoptosis may contribute to
various disease processes (34). Indeed, the occurrence of massive
apoptosis in stem-like chondrocytes and concomitant decrease in
cell proliferation supports our hypothesis that excessive apoptosis
of these cells may cause permanent growth retardation when
exposed to proteasome inhibition. We found that early-differentiated, i.e., stem-like chondrocytes, are not only more susceptible to
apoptosis but are also more prone to up-regulating p53 and AIF
upon proteasome inhibition. Our finding that AIF is expressed in
chondrocytes, is a target protein for ubiquitin, and is up-regulated
upon proteasome inhibition is of particular interest. It will be

important to confirm this novel observation in other model
systems. In an attempt to rescue chondrocytes from proteasome
inhibition–induced apoptosis, we used a pan-caspase inhibitor,
sequence-specific siRNAs against p53 and AIF, as well as a small
molecule inhibitor of p53 (pifithrin-a) and were able to partially
prevent apoptosis. These results, which could also serve as a
basis for cytoprotection strategies during anticancer treatment
with proteasome inhibitors, further validated our hypothesis
that proteasome inhibition causes both caspase-dependent and
-independent apoptosis in chondrocytes. Taken together, the current data obtained in a number of different model systems all point
to an increased sensitivity of stem-like chondrocytes to impairment
of the ubiquitin/proteasome system, and consequently, that the
loss of these chondrocytes will result in a diminished growth
potential.
Clinical follow-up reports reveal that survivors of childhood
cancer often have long-term severe complications secondary to
previously administered life-saving treatments (26). The selective
targeting of chondrocytes reported herein suggests that proteasome inhibitors may target essential cell populations causing longlasting and potentially irreversible side effects. Because of
encouraging results of proteasome inhibitors in cancer treatment,
it is anticipated that more selective and highly potent agents will
soon be developed. The low systemic toxicity of proteasome
inhibitors also makes these compounds attractive for the treatment
of childhood cancer. However, our observation that growth failure
is not restricted to treatment duration but might also result in
long-lasting effects on bone growth warrants careful assessment of
linear growth in children treated with proteasome inhibitors.
In conclusion, we report that the systemic administration of a
proteasome inhibitor impairs chondrogenesis by triggering apoptosis and decreasing chondrocyte proliferation, which leads to
long-term growth failure in treated mice. These preclinical
observations suggest that children treated with proteasome inhibitors
may be at risk for permanent side effects limiting bone growth
potential. In addition, our findings may also open new possibilities to
target bone sarcomas with proteasome inhibitors in adults.
