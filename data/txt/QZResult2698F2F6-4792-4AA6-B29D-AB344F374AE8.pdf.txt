ABSTRACT
The ATR–CHK1–WEE1 kinase cascade’s functions in the DNA damage checkpoints
are well established. Moreover, its roles in the unperturbed cell cycle are also
increasingly being recognized. In this connection, a number of small-molecule
inhibitors of ATR, CHK1, and WEE1 are being evaluated in clinical trials. Understanding
precisely how cells respond to different concentrations of inhibitors is therefore
of paramount importance and has broad clinical implications. Here we present
evidence that in the absence of DNA damage, pharmacological inactivation of ATR
was less effective in inducing mitotic catastrophe than inhibition of WEE1 and CHK1.
Small-molecule inhibitors of CHK1 (AZD7762) or WEE1 (MK-1775) induced mitotic
catastrophe, as characterized by dephosphorylation of CDK1Tyr15, phosphorylation of
histone H3Ser10, and apoptosis. Unexpectedly, partial inhibition of WEE1 and CHK1
had the opposite effect of accelerating the cell cycle without inducing apoptosis,
thereby increasing the overall cell proliferation. This was also corroborated by the
finding that cell proliferation was enhanced by kinase-inactive versions of WEE1. We
demonstrated that these potential limitations of the inhibitors could be overcome
by targeting more than one components of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 simultaneously.
These observations reveal insights into the complex responses to pharmacological
inactivation of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 axis.

INTRODUCTION

and Golgi complex, can phosphorylate both the Thr14 and
Tyr15 [3,4]. While WEE1 plays an indispensable role in
controlling the timing of mitosis, MYT1 appears to play a
relatively minor role in the somatic cell cycle [5].
A surveillance mechanism termed the G2 DNA
damage checkpoint prevents entry into mitosis after
DNA damage. The checkpoint comprises of a kinase
cascade initiating with the activation of ATM and the
related ATR. Activated ATM/ATR then phosphorylates
residues in the SQ/TQ domain of CHK1 and CHK2,
stimulating the activity of these effector kinases [6].
CHK1/CHK2 subsequently acts on all three isoforms
of the CDC25 family to suppress their activities [1].
CHK1 also phosphorylates and activates WEE1 by
promoting 14-3-3 binding [7,8]. Suppression of CDC25
or activation of WEE1 tips the balance towards CDK1Thr14/
Tyr15
phosphorylation, thereby preventing damaged cells
from entering mitosis. Although there are considerable

Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1) is the
major kinase for driving cells into mitosis. A defining
characteristic of CDK1 activation is a system of feedback
loops that converts the progressive accumulation of its
activating partner cyclin B1 into an abrupt activation
of CDK1 [1]. Premature activation of cyclin B1–CDK1
complexes is prevented by a mechanism involving
inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1Thr14/Tyr15 by MYT1
and WEE1. At the end of G2, the stockpile of inactive
cyclin B1–CDK1 complexes is rapidly activated by
CDC25 phosphatases. Cyclin B1–CDK1 catalyzes its own
activation with feedback loops that activate CDC25 and
inactivate WEE1/MYT1.
WEE1 is a dual-specificity kinase that
phosphorylates CDK1Tyr15 (but not CDK1Thr14) [2]. MYT1,

overlaps in the ATM/ATR–CHK1/CHK2 axis, it is
generally believed that while the ATM–CHK2 pathway
primarily responds to DNA double-strand breaks, the
ATR–CHK1 pathway is activated by a broader spectrum
of DNA abnormalities [9]. Premature inactivation of
the checkpoint promotes a process often termed mitotic
catastrophe, which is characterized by precocious mitosis
followed by apoptosis or mitotic slippage [10].
Agents that cause replication stress also activate a
similar checkpoint involving ATR–CHK1–WEE1. ATR
is activated after recruited to the single-strand binding
protein RPA that coats ssDNA, thereby stabilizing the
stalled forks and initiating checkpoint activation [11].
Origin firing, replication forks progression, and mitosis
are suppressed by this checkpoint.
In addition to its role in checkpoint control, the
ATR–CHK1–WEE1 pathway also plays an essential
role in the unperturbed cell cycle. Deletion of ATR
[12,13], CHK1 [14], or WEE1 [15] resulted in embryonic
lethality. Inhibition of these kinases during normal S phase
facilitates an unscheduled activation of cyclin E–CDK2.
The resulting increase in initiation of DNA replication
promotes DNA damage in a yet incompletely understood
mechanism [16]. One possibility is that the unscheduled
initiation of dormant origins reduces cellular resources
such as dNTPs or histone chaperones to levels insufficient
to support the number of active replication forks, thereby
leading to replication stalling and SLX4/MUS81-mediated
DNA double-strand breakage [17][18].
A promising anticancer strategy is by ablating the
G2 DNA damage checkpoint through targeting the ATR–
CHK1–WEE1 pathway. A number of small-molecule
inhibitors of ATR, CHK1, and WEE1 are being evaluated
in clinical trials, mainly in combination with DNAdamaging agents. On the other hand, it is possible that
these inhibitors can be effective as monotherapeutic
agents without DNA damage. Establishing precisely
how cells respond to different concentrations of
inhibitors is therefore of crucial importance. Based on
these premises, we found that in the absence of DNA
damage, inhibition of ATR was less useful in inducing
mitotic catastrophe comparing to inhibition of WEE1
and CHK1. Unexpectedly, sublethal concentrations of
inhibitors of WEE1 and CHK1 in fact accelerated the cell
cycle and increased cell proliferation. We demonstrated
that combinatorial treatment of inhibitors targeting the
ATR–CHK1–WEE1 pathway may be an alternative and
effective strategy in inducing mitotic catastrophe without
using DNA damage.

Pharmacological inactivation of CHK1 and
WEE1 but not ATR induces mitotic catastrophe
Given that relatively specific small-molecule
inhibitors of components of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1
cascade have been developed, we first examined if they
could stimulate similar cell cycle responses in otherwise
unstressed cells. Fig 1A shows that incubation of HeLa
cells with the WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 [19] (designated
WEE1i herein) or the CHK1 inhibitor AZD7762 [20]
(designated CHK1i herein) was sufficient to enrich cells
in G2/M or the later part of S phase. The appearance of
cells possessing sub-G1 DNA content after incubation with
high concentrations of the chemicals indicated extensive
apoptosis was induced (Fig 1A).
In marked contrast, an inhibitor of ATR (VE-821
[21], designated ATRi herein) did not induce similar
cell cycle delay even when used at 10 µM (250 nM of
CHK1i or WEE1i was sufficient to induce G2/M defects)
(Fig 1A). Similar results were obtained using another
cell line (H1299) (Supplemental Fig S1A), excluding the
possibility that the differential effects of the chemicals
were peculiar for HeLa cells.
Inhibition of either CHK1 or WEE1 resulted in
mitotic catastrophe, as indicated by the dephosphorylation
of CDK1Tyr15 and an accumulation of mitotic markers
including phosphorylated histone H3Ser10 (Fig 1B and
1C). The cells eventually accumulated DNA damage and
underwent apoptosis, as indicated by the appearance of
γ-H2AX and cleaved PARP1, respectively. As expected,
ATRi did not affect these mitotic and apoptotic events up
to 5 µM (Fig S1B).
To attain more direct insights into the fates of
CHK1i/WEE1i-treated cells, cells expressing histone
H2B-GFP were used and individual cells were tracked
with live-cell imaging. Time-lapse microscopy indicated
that inhibition of WEE1 (and to a lesser extent CHK1)
increased the duration of mitosis (Fig 1D, the data for
individual cells are shown in Fig S2). Furthermore, both
WEE1i and CHK1i reduced cell survival within the
imaging period (Fig 1E).
To ensure that the ATRi used was actually capable
of inhibiting ATR, cells were first arrested in G2 phase
with DNA damage before challenged with ATRi (Fig
2A). Activation of the G2 DNA damage checkpoint by
ionizing radiation was characterized by a high level of
CDK1Tyr15 phosphorylation and a low level of histone
H3Ser10 phosphorylation. Significantly, 2.5 µM of ATRi
was sufficient to overcome the checkpoint, reversing the
phosphorylation of CDK1Tyr15 and histone H3Ser10. We also
tracked the fate of the ATRi-treated cells directly using
time-lapse microscopy. Fig 2B shows that while control

cells entered and exited mitosis randomly during the
imaging period, the majority of cells stopped cell cycle
progression and remained in interphase after IR was
applied. Significantly, the IR-treated cells were able to
enter mitosis in the presence of ATRi, indicating that the
G2 DNA damage checkpoint was abrogated. As expected,
checkpoint abrogation resulted in mitosis that was longer
than normal and with frequent mitotic slippage. As a
control and in accordance with the above data, incubating

the cells with the same concentration of ATRi alone did
not affect the unperturbed mitosis (the slight extension of
mitosis compare to control was not significant; P > 0.1).
Taken together, these results revealed fundamental
differences among the current generations of chemicals
that target components of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 kinase
cascade: while mitotic catastrophe is induced by targeting
either CHK1 or WEE1, unstressed cells are relatively
unresponsive to ATR inhibition.

survival (** P < 0.01; Student’s t-test).

and CHK1i inhibited cell proliferation (Fig 3A). We noted,
however, that cell growth was slightly increased at lower
concentrations of WEE1i. This growth simulation was
also observed when the cell cycle of individual cells was
analyzed using time-lapse microscopy (Fig 3B). When
WEE1i was applied to a randomly growing population, the
first mitosis in general occurred earlier than in the control

of WEE1i/CHK1i on cell proliferation, we initially
analyzed a cell line (HONE1) expressing the infrared

iRFP-based platform to measure cell proliferation
because of its broad linear range, high sensitivity, and
the capability in providing rapid and economical time-

cells were able to undergo the second mitosis during the
imaging period.
To further test the idea that partial inhibition of
WEE1 could increase cell growth, we generated cell lines
stably expressing a kinase-inactive version of WEE1
(K328R) (Fig S4B). A N∆214 truncation version lacking
the negative regulatory domain of WEE1 was also used
(see Fig S4A for a schematic diagram of the constructs).
Fig 4 shows that both kinase-inactive WEE1(KR) and
WEE1N∆214(KR) speeded up proliferation, reducing the

A similar increase in cell proliferation after
incubation with low concentrations of WEE1i was also
observed with other cell lines, including H1299 (Fig S3A)
and HeLa (Fig S3B). In some cell lines, an increase in
cell growth was also observed with low concentrations of
CHK1i (Fig S3A and S3B). We also verified the increase
of cell number using conventional trypan blue staining and
cell counting (Fig S3C).
Although ATRi alone did not trigger mitotic
catastrophe in HeLa cells, it also accelerated the cell
cycle (Fig 2B). ATRi-treated cells entered the first mitosis

different cell cycle phases was not significantly affected
by kinase-dead WEE1(KR) (Fig S4C), the cell cycle as a
whole was shortened (Fig S4D). By contrast, expression
of the corresponding kinase-active WEE1 and WEE1N∆214
reduced cell proliferation (Fig 4) and slowed down the cell
cycle (Fig S4D). Taken together, these results indicated
that while complete inhibition of WEE1 inhibited cell
growth, limited inhibition of the ATR-CHK1-WEE1
pathway, either with relative low concentrations of
inhibitors or kinase-inactive mutants of WEE1, could
accelerate the cell cycle and stimulate growth.

stimulating cell proliferation. As ATR, CHK1, and WEE1
are components of a linear pathway, we next tested if
more extensive mitotic catastrophe can be induced when
more than one component are targeted together, even with
relatively low concentrations of the drugs.
Interestingly, although ATRi alone did not affect
the cell cycle (Fig 1A, S1A, and 2B), it was able to
enhance premature mitosis when combined with sublethal
concentrations of CHK1i or WEE1i. Incubating cells
with ATRi and CHK1i or ATRi and WEE1i induced a
higher portion of G2/M cells than the individual chemicals
alone (Fig 5A). Consistent with mitotic catastrophe, cells
receiving both chemicals expressed dephosphorylated
CDK1Tyr15, phosphorylated histone H3Ser10, and cleaved
PARP1 (Fig 5B).
By comparison, combining CHK1i and WEE1i
promoted massive cell death (Fig 6A). Again, sublethal
concentrations of CHK1i and WEE1i which did not
trigger mitotic catastrophe on their own were used here.
The combined treatments prompted dephosphorylation

of CDK1Tyr15, phosphorylation of histone H3Ser10, and
accumulation of γ-H2AX (Fig 6B). Consistent with
apoptosis, there was an increase in PAPR1 cleavage and
cell death (Fig 6B). Time-lapse microscopy confirmed
that CHK1i and WEE1i together induced a prolonged
mitosis and extensive cell death compare to the individual
chemicals alone (Fig 6C).
To address if the effects of CHK1i and WEE1i were
specific for the respective kinases, CHK1 and WEE1
were also downregulated with siRNAs. Fig 7A verifies

that downregulation of CHK1 with siRNA increased
the sensitivity to WEE1i (Fig 7A). Conversely, siRNA
against WEE1 enhanced the disruption of the cell cycle
by CHK1i. Not surprisingly, knockdown of CHK1 or
WEE1 enhanced the effectiveness of CHK1i or WEE1i,
respectively. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed the
downregulation of CHK1 and WEE1 (Fig 7B). It also
revealed the increase in premature mitosis (histone H3Ser10
phosphorylation) and apoptosis (PARP1 cleavage) by the
combination of siRNAs and inhibitors.

Collectively, these data indicated that even with
sublethal concentrations of inhibitors, targeting ATR with
either CHK1 or WEE1, or CHK1 and WEE1 concurrently
induced massive mitotic catastrophe.

combination with chemo- and radiotherapy. For example,
ATRi (VE-821) was found to enhance the cytotoxicity
caused by DNA damaging agents, particularly in cells with
defective ATM and p53 [23]. Likewise, several studies
have detailed the properties of inhibitors of CHK1 [24]
and WEE1 [25] on sensitizing cells to DNA damage.
As standalone agents, CHK1i and WEE1i are
believed to induce DNA damage by unscheduled initiation
of DNA replication [16][18]. Given that CHK1 and WEE1
are components of the checkpoint itself, the DNA damage
induced by CHK1i/WEE1i is unable to elicit an effective
checkpoint response. Hence inhibition of CHK1/WEE1
is expected to disrupt cells in a two-step process. DNA
damage is first induced by the unscheduled initiation of
DNA replication during S phase, which normally would
turn on the G2 DNA damage checkpoint. The presence of
CHK1i/WEE1i, however, uncoupled the checkpoint and
allowed the damaged cells to enter mitosis. It should be
noted that the cell lines used in this study have defective
p53 responses (HeLa: p53 is degraded by HPV E6; H1299:
p53 genes are deleted), a feature commonly found in many
cancers. The lack of p53-dependent cell cycle arrest should
further enhance both the precocious S phase progression
and mitotic entry induced by CHK1i and WEE1i.
In agreement with the above hypothesis, CHK1i
and WEE1i induced an accumulation of G2/M cells in
HeLa (Fig 1A) and H1299 (Fig S1A). Several lines
of evidence verified that CHK1i and WEE1i triggered
mitotic catastrophe, including the increase of histone
H3Ser10 phosphorylation, apoptosis (Fig 1B and 1C), and an
extension of mitotic duration (Fig 1D). Not surprisingly,
exposure to CHK1i/WEE1i eventually led to a decline of
viability (Fig 3A and S3), probably mainly due to mitotic
cell death (Fig 1D and 1E).
By comparing inhibitors targeting ATR, CHK1,
and WEE1 side-by-side on the same cell lines, we
found that in contrast to CHK1i and WEE1i, ATRi was
relatively ineffective in inducing mitotic catastrophe (Fig
1A). These findings were confirmed more rigorously by
tracking individual cells using live-cell imaging (Fig 2B
and S2). Moreover, the relative ineffectiveness of ATRi
was not limited to HeLa cells (Fig 1A), but also displayed
by H1299 (Fig S1A), as well as several cell lines from
nasopharyngeal carcinoma we tested (our unpublished
data). Given that the Ki of the ATRi VE-821 is 6 nM (and
>600-fold selectivity over related kinases ATM or DNAPK) [21], the concentrations of ATRi used in this study
should be sufficient to inhibit the kinase. Indeed, the IRinduced G2 DNA damage checkpoint could readily be
uncoupled with ATRi, leading to dephosphorylation of
CDK1Tyr15 and precocious mitotic entry (Fig 2). Although
the mechanistic basis of the relatively weak cytotoxicity
of ATRi compare to CHK1i/WEE1i remains to be
defined, our observations suggest that targeting different
components of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 pathway may not
be equally effective in the same cell system.

DISCUSSION
A major focus of the clinical development of
inhibitors of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 pathway is for

We observed that instead of reducing proliferation,
low concentrations of CHK1i and WEE1i actually
increased cell number (Fig 3 and S3). These data
indicated that the disruption of cell cycle control after
partial inhibition of CHK1/WEE1 did not necessary
result in lethal mitotic catastrophe. Although the increase
in cell growth occurred in a narrow concentration range
of CHK1i/WEE1i and is probably cell-type dependent,
this has broad clinical implications on the use of smallmolecule inhibitors of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 pathway.
This is likely to be caused by the shortening of the
cell cycle in the cancer cells after treatment with low
concentrations of the inhibitors (Fig 4). As cancer cells
including H1299 and HeLa are already highly aneuploid,
they are likely to be relatively tolerant to some degree of
DNA damage or chromosomal instability associated with
the acceleration of cell cycle caused by partial inhibition
of WEE1 pathway.
Given the potential detrimental effects of partial
inhibition of the ATR–CHK1–WEE1 pathway, it is
important to understand how the balance can be offset
towards mitotic catastrophe. We demonstrated that one
possible solution of this problem is by targeting more
than one components of the pathway together. Although
ATRi was not effective on its own, it could enhance the
mitotic catastrophe induced by sublethal concentrations of
CHK1i and WEE1i (Fig 5). Furthermore, challenging cells
with CHK1i and WEE1i together induced more extensive
mitotic catastrophe than the individual drugs alone (Fig
6). These results are consistent with the synergistic
effects of inhibitors of CHK1 and WEE1 observed in
other cancer models. For example, WEE1i (MK-1775)
cooperates with the CHK1 inhibitor AR458323 in
inhibiting cell proliferation in prostate and lung cancer
cell lines [26]. Another CHK1 inhibitor PF-00477736 acts
synergistically with WEE1i in a panel of cancer cell lines
(including breast, colon, ovarian, and prostate) [27]. The
CHK1 inhibitor MK-8776 also cooperates with WEE1i
in reducing tumor growth in colorectal, ovarian [28], and
neuroblastoma [29] mouse xenograft models. Together,
these data indicated that although CHK1i/WEE1i have the
potential drawback of enhancing cancer cell growth at low
concentrations, targeting more than one component of the
checkpoint pathway together can help to tip the balance
towards mitotic catastrophe.

HeLa cells stably expressing histone H2B-GFP
[35] were used for live-cell imaging. H1299, HeLa,
and HONE1 cells expressing iRFP were generated by
transfection followed by cell sorting. The cells were
transfected with an iRFP-expressing construct and
iRFP-positive cells were enriched by sorting using a
flow cytometer with a 633-nm red laser for excitation
(FACSAria II, Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ,
USA). The cells were sorted again after one week. Three
rounds of sorting were performed.
Cell lines expressing recombinant WEE1
were produced by transfecting constructs of pSLXCMV expressing WEE1, WEE1N∆214, WEE1(K328R), or
WEE1N∆214(K328R) into H1299 cells. The cells were then
selected in medium supplemented with 100 µg/ml of
G418. Medium containing G418 was replenished every
three days and individual colonies were isolated and
expanded in culture after about 3 weeks of selection. Cellfree extracts were prepared and the expression of WEE1
or mutants was analyzed by immunoblotting. After the
establishment of the cell lines, subsequent experiments
were performed in the absence of G418. Cell growth
of WEE1-expressing cells was measured by plating the
cells at a density of about 10,000 cells/60-mm plate, and
counting the attached cells in the same randomly selected
areas (five 2-mm diameter circles) every 24 h using a light
microscope. The positions of the circles were fixed at the
bottom of the culture plate.
Unless stated otherwise, cells were treated with the
following reagents at the indicated final concentration:
