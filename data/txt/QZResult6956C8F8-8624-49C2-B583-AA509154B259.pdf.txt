SUMMARY

Author Manuscript

Herein we report that the VEGFR/PDGFR kinase inhibitor sunitinib/SU11248 can accelerate
metastatic tumor growth and decrease overall survival in mice receiving short-term therapy in
various metastasis assays, including after intravenous injection of tumor cells or after removal of
primary orthotopically grown tumors. Acceleration of metastasis was also observed in mice
receiving sunitinib prior to intravenous implantation of tumor cells, suggesting possible
“metastatic conditioning” in multiple organs. Similar findings with additional VEGF receptor
tyrosine kinase inhibitors implicate a class-specific effect for such agents. Importantly, these
observations of metastatic acceleration were in contrast to the demonstrable antitumor benefits
obtained when the same human breast cancer cells, as well as mouse or human melanoma cells,
were grown orthotopically as primary tumors and subjected to identical sunitinib treatments.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

Multiple strategies for inhibiting the VEGF pathway have been shown in numerous
preclinical studies to hinder tumor growth, and the recent approval of a VEGF-neutralizing
antibody (bevacizumab) and VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs) (sorafenib
and sunitinib) has clinically validated targeting VEGF or its receptors (particularly
VEGFR2) as an anticancer treatment (Folkman, 2007). The purpose of the present study was
to test whether a VEGF RTKI, when administered daily for short periods, can influence the
growth of experimental and spontaneous metastasis in mice. The rationale for this
experimental design was based on a number of recent clinical and preclinical observations.
First, while sorafenib and sunitinib have been approved for the treatment of renal cell
carcinoma, as well as hepatocellular carcinoma (sorafenib only) and gastrointestinal stromal

tumor (sunitinib only), enduring clinical responses are rare. Moreover, single-agent use of
such drugs, including bevacizumab, has not led to meaningful beneficial activity in many
cases. Second, when such agents are administered on a discontinuous schedule, such as with
sunitinib (4 weeks on/2 weeks off), tumor regrowth has sometimes been observed during
drug-free break periods (Burstein et al., 2008) or when treatment is discontinued (Johannsen
et al., 2008). Third, rapid tumor revascularization has been reported when therapy is stopped
in preclinical studies (Mancuso et al., 2006). Finally, we recently reported that a number of
changes in proangiogenic plasma proteins observed in patients after sunitinib treatment
could be recapitulated in non-tumor-bearing mice, and moreover, in a dose-dependent
manner (Ebos et al., 2007). Together, these results suggest a systemic host response to
VEGF inhibition that could play a role in regrowth of both tumor and vasculature in
eventual evasion of response during continued antiangiogenic treatment (Bergers and
Hanahan, 2008; Casanovas et al., 2005) as well as potentially influencing the progression of
secondary (metastatic) disease—a possibility that could impact the outcome of neoadjuvant
and adjuvant administration of such agents (von Mehren, 2008; Shuch et al., 2008). In this
study, we examined the impact of sunitinib on metastasis, with the choice of sunitinib based
not only on our aforementioned work but also on the discontinuous administration schedule
of this agent currently used in clinical practice (Motzer et al., 2006).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Our first experiments tested the effect of short-term sunitinib treatment in a model of
experimental metastasis. Human metastatic breast cancer 231/LM2-4LUC+ cells expressing
luciferase were injected into the tail vein of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
mice, which then received vehicle treatment or a short-term sunitinib therapy regimen (120
mg/kg/daily for 7 days) administered by gavage either before or after tumor cell inoculation
(groups A, B, and C, respectively; Figure 1A). Short-term sunitinib treatment administered
either before or after tumor cell injection resulted in accelerated experimental metastasis as
measured by bioluminescence (Figure 1A) and significantly reduced median survival
compared to vehicle-treated controls (Figure 1B). Representative images showing increased
metastasis in sunitinib-treated mice are shown in Figure 1C. The choice of 120 mg/kg daily
sunitinib for a 7-day period was based on prior preclinical studies that had demonstrated this
short-term regimen to maximize the aforementioned multiple host-derived changes in
proangiogenic proteins in mouse plasma. A sustained sunitinib therapy regimen of 60
mg/kg/day given continuously (described below) had previously been shown to result in
optimal tumor inhibition with minimal toxicity after long-term therapy (Ebos et al., 2007).
The treatment for group B was stopped 24 hr prior to injection of tumor cells in order to
minimize any potential direct drug effect on tumor cells, as blood concentrations of sunitinib
are significantly reduced 24 hr after treatment cessation, and to maximize the
aforementioned sunitinib-induced host molecular changes, which were shown to be reversed
within 2–5 days after stopping therapy (Ebos et al., 2007). Importantly, similar results were
obtained when nu/nu mice were treated with other VEGF RTKIs including sorafenib (150
mg/kg/day) and SU10944 (225 mg/kg/day) 7 days prior to tumor cell inoculation (see
Figures S1A–S1C available online). These results suggest that a host response to

multitargeted angiogenic kinase inhibition can result in conditions that allow for increased
tumor initiation even after drug has been removed.
We next tested the effect of short-term sunitinib treatment on distant spontaneous metastasis
generated after primary tumor removal using the protocol illustrated in Figure 2A. Mice
receiving short-term adjuvant sunitinib therapy showed increased spontaneous metastatic
tumor burden as measured by bioluminescence (Figures 2A and 2B), which corresponded
with decreased overall survival (Figure 2C). To ensure equal tumor burden between groups
prior to drug treatment, resected tumors were weighed prior to sorting into groups A and B
(Figure 2D).

We have previously reported that surgical resection of highly metastatic orthotopically
grown 231/LM2-4 tumors leads to spontaneous metastasis in the lungs, liver, and lymph
nodes, with the primary determinant for euthanasia being extensive visceral and peripheral
metastasis (Man et al., 2007). In the spontaneous and experimental metastasis studies
described herein, we similarly considered visceral and peripheral disease as the primary
reason for mouse sacrifice (data not shown). To test for differences in distribution of
metastatic disease after sunitinib treatment, mice subjected to the same protocol as described
in Figure 1 were sacrificed 27 days after tumor implantation to allow for assessment of 231/
LM2-4LUC+ tumor burden using bioluminescence (Figure S2). Increased overall tumor
burden was found in mice receiving sunitinib before or after tumor inoculation (groups B
and C compared to group A; Figure 3A, inset), which corresponded to increased metastatic
tumor burden in multiple organs, while no obvious differences in overall tumor distribution
were observed (Figure 3A). Immunohistochemical staining for tumor tissue in mouse organs
using an anti-human vimentin antibody confirmed increased micrometastasis in various
organs in groups B and C compared with controls in group A (Figure 3B, upper panel).
Importantly, increased metastasis in multiple organs was observed in an additional tumor
model when human MeWo melanoma cells were injected intravenously (i.v.) into nu/nu
mice pretreated with either vehicle or short-term sunitinib therapy (groups A and B,
respectively; Figure 3B, lower panel). Examples of micrometastases detected using an
antibody specific to human vimentin are shown in Figure 3C. Finally, increased visible lung
surface nodules and lung weight were indicative of increased tumor burden in both tumor
models, with representative hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and anti-vimentin staining shown
in Figure 3D.

Since previously published studies had demonstrated potent tumor growth inhibition of
established primary tumors in mice after sunitinib treatment (Christensen, 2007), we
compared short-term and sustained sunitinib therapies in both orthotopic primary tumor and
experimental metastasis models. 231/LM2-4LUC+ cells were implanted into the mammary
fat pad of nu/nu mice and treated with vehicle or sustained sunitinib therapy (60 mg/kg/
daily) when tumors reached 200 mm3 in size (groups A and B; Figure 4A). A third group of
mice received short-term sunitinib treatment (120 mg/kg/day for 7 days) starting the day
after tumor implantation (group C; Figure 4A). Significant tumor growth delay was
observed after either short-term or sustained treatment compared to controls, with sustained
sunitinib therapy having more potent tumor-inhibitory effects. In contrast, accelerated tumor
growth was observed when the same cells were injected i.v. into nu/nu mice receiving short-

term sunitinib therapy either before or immediately after tumor inoculation (groups A, B,
and C; Figure 4B). Short-term treatment followed by sustained sunitinib therapy did not
abrogate this acceleration of tumor growth, and mice receiving only sustained treatment,
initiated 7 days following tumor inoculation, did not exhibit reduced tumor burden
compared to controls (groups D and E; Figure 4B). Corresponding survival curves show
significantly decreased median survival in groups B, C, and D when compared to controls,
with group E showing no overall prolongation of survival. Importantly, as an additional
example of opposing efficacies of sunitinib therapy in both orthotopic primary tumor and
experimental metastasis models, we observed potent tumor growth inhibition in nu/nu mice
bearing orthotopically growing human MeWo melanoma tumors that were treated with
sustained sunitinib therapy (Figure S3). This was in contrast to the increased metastasis
observed in the lungs of mice 58 days after i.v. inoculation of tumor cells immediately
following short-term sunitinib therapy (Figure 3D).

We next tested whether similar results would be observed in a syngeneic mouse tumor
model following the same treatment protocol as in Figure 4A. Mouse B16 melanoma cells
were implanted subdermally into the flanks of C57BL/6 mice and, as in the aforementioned
human xenograft experiments, primary tumor growth was found to be delayed in mice
receiving sustained sunitinib treatment compared to controls (groups A and B; Figure 4D).
In contrast, and similar to Figure 4C, C57BL/6 mice receiving short-term sunitinib treatment
for 7 days prior to i.v. tumor inoculation showed decreased survival compared to controls,
whereas sustained sunitinib therapy, initiated 8 days after inoculation, showed no survival
advantage (groups A, B, and E; Figure 4E). Interestingly, mice receiving short-term
sunitinib therapy immediately following tumor inoculation, which was then either stopped
after 7 days (group C) or followed by sustained sunitinib therapy (group D), exhibited a
survival advantage in some instances. Group D mice showed a significant prolongation of
survival compared to control mice, while mice in group C had biphasic effects, with about
half of the mice progressing with accelerated metastasis and the remainder showing a
prolongation in survival, even after cessation of treatment (Figure 4E). One potential
explanation for these results could stem from possible direct antitumor activity of sunitinib
therapy against B16 cells—something that has been demonstrated previously with other
VEGF RTKIs (Beaudry et al., 2008).

Author Manuscript

Taken together, our results show that VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition by the same
drug, administered in different schedules and doses using three different tumor cell models,
can have opposing effects on tumor growth. Sustained sunitinib treatment of preestablished
tumors led to significant growth inhibition in both orthotopically grown primary human
xenograft and syngeneic tumors. In contrast, short-term treatment prior to i.v. inoculation
with the same cells produced an acceleration of metastasis and corresponding significant
reduction in median survival. Furthermore, sustained treatment in both 231/LM2-4LUC+ and
B16 experimental metastasis models, initiated 7 days after tumor cell inoculation, did not
produce a survival advantage compared to controls. Conversely, short-term sunitinib
treatment immediately following tumor inoculation was shown to accelerate metastatic
disease (in the 231/LM2-4LUC+ model) or produce a biphasic response (in the B16 model).

Our results complement those of Pàez-Ribes et al. (2009) in this issue of Cancer Cell.
Importantly, in both studies, antiangiogenic drug treatment was shown to have potent
inhibitory effects in localized tumors. Furthermore, Pàez-Ribes et al. show that treatment of
tumor-bearing mice with antiangiogenic drugs, including the VEGFR2-blocking monoclonal
antibody DC101 and VEGF RTKIs such as sunitinib and SU10944, leads to increased local
tumor cell invasion and enhanced distant metastasis after prolonged treatment or, in the case
of DC101, after only short-term treatment. As Pàez-Ribes et al. demonstrate, these effects
appear to be an adaptive/evasive response by the tumor cells themselves triggered by a
disruption of the tumor vasculature. Our results present a second possibility independent of
adaptations by an established tumor that involves microenvironmental changes in mouse
organs that are “conditioned” to be more permissive to tumor extravasation. But how might
such a metastatic “conditioning” effect occur? A number of potential mechanisms alone or
in combination could play a role. One is the aforementioned induced upregulation of
multiple circulating proangiogenic cytokines and growth factors in response to treatment,
including osteopontin, G-CSF, and SDF1α (Ebos et al., 2007)—all of which have been
implicated in angiogenesis and/or metastasis (McAllister et al., 2008; Ben Baruch, 2008;
Wai and Kuo, 2008; Natori et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2000). Second, and likely related to
such molecular changes, the mobilization of bone marrow-derived cells may facilitate an
enhanced “pre-metastatic niche,” including circulating endothelial (Okazaki et al., 2006) and
myeloid progenitors (Shojaei et al., 2008), CXCR4+ recruited bone marrow circulating cells
(Grunewald et al., 2006), and circulating VEGFR1+ bone marrow cells (Kaplan et al., 2005).
Finally, the well-recognized target promiscuity of RTKIs such as sunitinib and sorafenib
(Karaman et al., 2008) may produce a plethora of broad host microenvironmental responses
to cellular inhibition/injury. These responses in turn may promote tumor extravasation,
similar in principal to the enhanced metastasis observed after treatment with radiation and
numerous chemotherapeutic drugs (van Putten et al., 1975; Vollmer and Conley, 1984; de
Ruiter et al., 1982)—all of which may involve various proinflammatory responses (Noonan
et al., 2008) or alterations in the endothelial microenvironment. Collectively, such effects
could create a more favorable metastatic niche (Bidard et al., 2008). Importantly, however,
unlike chemotherapy and radiation treatments, which act in large part via direct tumor
cytotoxicity by nonspecifically targeting proliferating cells and are administered for defined
periods, antiangiogenic agents act in large part against host tumor support processes, thus
indirectly prohibiting tumor growth, and are meant (at least theoretically) to be administered
indefinitely. Regardless of the actual mechanisms involved, our results may be pertinent to
the consideration of several prominent issues in cancer therapeutics, including the relative
benefits of discontinuous versus continuous treatment schedules of antiangiogenic drugs
(such as sunitinib), duration of treatment, use of such drugs in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant
setting, and the prospect that drugs targeting metastatic mechanisms might be considered in
the future for combination with antiangiogenic agents, aiming to improve their overall
antitumor efficacy.

SIGNIFICANCE
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors to impair angiogenesis now represents a clinically
validated anticancer treatment strategy. However, the benefits of VEGF-targeted agents
in the treatment of late-stage cancers can be transitory, resulting in eventual drug
resistance, tumor growth and/or regrowth, and rapid vascular recovery when therapy is
stopped. Our findings here demonstrate that angiogenesis inhibition in mice can lead to
opposing effects on tumor growth and metastasis depending on tumor stage and treatment
duration. These observations could have clinical implications with respect to optimal
dose, treatment schedule, and therapy in the adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting and highlight
the importance of testing additional drugs in combination as a possible approach to
abrogate this effect.

Figure 3. Increased Multiorgan Metastasis in Mice after Short-Term Sunitinib Treatment

Author Manuscript

(A) Following the same experimental design as described in Figure 1A, SCID mice were
sacrificed at day 27 to compare increases in overall tumor burden after short-term sunitinib
treatment (inset) and corresponding increased bioluminescence in multiple organs (groups
A, B, and C). Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Instances of highly divergent
bioluminescence values did not permit statistical significance to be reached in all groups.
0.01 < *p < 0.05 by one-way ANOVA.
(B) Micrometastases were confirmed by immunostaining for human vimentin in organs of
the 231/LM2-4LUC+ tumor model in (A) (upper panel) or in nu/nu mice receiving vehicle
(group A) or short-term sunitinib therapy (group B) prior to intravenous (i.v.) inoculation
with human MeWo melanoma cells (lower panel). Tissue sections were scored as positive or
negative based on the presence or absence of detectable micrometastases. NT = not tested.
(C) Representative examples of micrometastases in spleen, liver, kidney, and brain shown
using human-specific vimentin antibodies.
(D) Excised lungs from 231/LM2-4LUC+ and MeWo tumor models were scored visually for
surface tumor nodules, with confirmation of macrometastasis by hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) and anti-vimentin immunostaining (representative images shown). For groups A, B,

Figure 4. Differentiating Opposing Efficacies of Short-Term and Sustained Sunitinib Treatment
in Primary and Metastatic Disease

(A) nu/nu mice bearing orthotopically grown 231/LM2-4LUC+ tumors received either
vehicle (group A) or sustained sunitinib therapy (group B) when tumors reached an average
volume of 200 mm3. A third group received short-term sunitinib therapy (group C) starting
the day after tumor implantation. Group A reached tumor volume endpoint (1500 mm3) at
27 days, with comparative tumor volume significantly reduced in group B (p = 0.0002 by
Student’s t test) and group C (p = 0.0027 by Student’s t test) at the same time point. Mice
receiving sustained sunitinib therapy showed greater tumor growth inhibition compared to

mice receiving short-term therapy (41 to 62 days to endpoint, respectively). n = 5 for all
groups.
(B) nu/nu mice injected i.v. with231/LM2-4LUC+cells were treated daily with vehicle (group
A) or received short-term sunitinib therapy for 7 days either before (group B) or after tumor
inoculation (group C). Quantification of bioluminescence showed accelerated metastatic
tumor growth in groups B and C after short-term sunitinib therapy. Mice in groups D and E
received sustained sunitinib therapy starting on day 8, with group D also receiving shortterm sunitinib therapy similar to group C.
(C) Corresponding Kaplan-Meier survival curves show that median survival was
significantly decreased in groups B, C, and D (p=0.0011, p=0.0022, and p=0.0365 by logrank test, respectively) and was not significantly different in group E (p=0.4485 by log-rank
test) compared to control mice in group A. For (B) and (C): group A, n = 7; group B, n = 7;
group C, n = 7; group D, n = 5; group E, n = 5.
(D) In a syngeneic tumor model, C57BL/6 mice bearing mouse B16 melanoma tumors
grown orthotopically showed delayed primary tumor growth after sustained sunitinib
therapy compared with control mice (groups A and B, with time to endpoint 17 and 28 days,
respectively). Group A, n = 4; group B, n = 4.
(E) C57BL/6 mice receiving short-term sunitinib therapy prior to i.v. inoculation with the
same mouse B16 melanoma tumor cells showed accelerated experimental metastasis and
decreased survival compared to controls (group B; p = 0.0014 by log-rank test). Delayed
metastasis and increased survival were observed in mice receiving short-term sunitinib
treatment followed by sustained sunitinib treatment (group D; p = 0.0047 by log-rank test).
Mice receiving sustained sunitinib therapy 7 days after tumor implantation showed no
difference in survival compared to vehicle-treated control mice (group E; p=0.6368 by logranktest). Mice receiving short-term sunitinib therapy following tumor implantation
exhibited a bimodal response that included either accelerated metastasis and reduced
survival or extended survival (group C; p= 0.3391 by log-rank test). Group A, n = 10; group
B, n=10; group C, n=9; group D, n=5; group E, n= 5. Sunitinib dose and treatment schedule
were performed as illustrated.
Data are presented as mean ± SD. 0.01 < *p < 0.05; 0.001 < **p < 0.01; ***p < 0.001.
