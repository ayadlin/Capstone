Abstract
Previous studies, including those from our laboratory, have
revealed that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a constituent
of many edible cruciferous vegetables, not only affords
significant protection against chemically induced cancer in
animal models but also inhibits growth of cancer cells in
culture and in vivo by causing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
induction. We now report a novel response to PEITC involving
inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo at pharmacologically achievable concentrations. The PEITC treatment
caused a decrease in survival of human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) in a concentration- and timedependent manner. The capillary-like tube structure formation (in vitro neovascularization) and migration (invasion
potential) by HUVEC was also inhibited significantly in the
presence of PEITC at pharmacologically relevant concentrations (<1 Mmol/L). The PEITC-mediated inhibition of angiogenic features of HUVEC in vitro was associated with
suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
secretion, down-regulation of VEGF receptor 2 protein levels,
and inactivation of prosurvival serine-threonine kinase Akt.
The PEITC treatment reduced migration by PC-3 human
prostate cancer cells, which correlated with inactivation of
Akt and suppression of VEGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF),
and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion.
The PEITC-mediated inhibition of PC-3 cell migration was
statistically significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of
constitutively active Akt. Most importantly, PEITC treatment
inhibited ex vivo angiogenesis as revealed by chicken egg
chorioallantoic membrane assay. In conclusion, the present
study suggests that inhibition of angiogenesis may be an
important mechanism in cancer chemoprevention by PEITC.

Introduction
Angiogenesis ( formation of new blood vessels) is a highly
complex and tightly regulated physiologic process that is implicated
in pathogenesis of many chronic diseases, including cancer,
rheumatoid arthritis, endometriosis, and diabetic retinopathy
(1, 2). Angiogenesis in tumors permits the growth and invasiveness
of cancer cells leading to metastasis to distant organs (3, 4).
Evidence is accumulating to indicate that angiogenesis is especially
critical for growth and progression of solid tumors because growth
in tumor mass beyond 2 to 3 mm is often preceded by an increase

in formation of new blood vessels presumably essential for delivery
of nutrients and oxygen to the tumor microenvironment (2–5).
Therefore, antiangiogenic therapy represents one of the most
promising approaches to control tumor growth and invasiveness
(5–7). Interestingly, many of the antiangiogenic agents currently in
clinical trials are natural products (6). Drug development from
natural products is a rapidly emerging and highly promising
strategy to identify novel antiangiogenic and anticancer agents.
Epidemiologic studies continue to support the premise that
dietary intake of cruciferous vegetables may be protective against
the risk of various types of malignancies (8). Anticarcinogenic effect
of cruciferous vegetables is attributed to organic isothiocyanates
(ITC) that occur naturally as thioglucoside conjugates (glucosinolates) in a variety of edible cruciferous vegetables, such as broccoli,
watercress, and cabbage (9). Organic ITCs are generated due to
hydrolysis of corresponding glucosinolates through catalytic
mediation of myrosinase, which is released on damage of the
plant cells during processing (cutting or chewing) of cruciferous
vegetables. Phenethyl-ITC (PEITC) is one of the best-studied
members of the ITC family of compounds that has generated a
great deal of research interest due to its cancer chemopreventive
activity (10–14). For example, PEITC administration was shown to
significantly inhibit 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone–induced pulmonary neoplasia in mice (10), N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine–induced esophageal cancer in rats (11), and
benzo(a)pyrene-induced carcinogenesis in mice (14). Impaired
carcinogen activation due to inhibition of cytochrome P450–
dependent monooxygenases and/or increased detoxification of the
carcinogenic intermediates due to induction of phase 2 enzymes
(e.g., glutathione transferases) are considered important mechanisms for PEITC-mediated inhibition of chemically induced
cancers in animal models (reviewed in ref. 9).
Studies, including those from our laboratory, have revealed that
PEITC and other naturally occurring ITC compounds have the
ability to suppress growth of human cancer cells in culture as well
as in vivo in xenograft assays by causing cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis induction (15–22). For instance, p.o. gavage of PEITC
significantly retards growth of PC-3 and TRAMP-C1 prostate
cancer xenografts in nude mice in association with induction of
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members (19, 21). It was also shown
recently that PEITC inhibits transcriptional activity of nuclear
factor-nB (NF-nB) and suppresses expression of NF-nB–regulated
genes, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in PC-3
human prostate cancer cells (23). Because VEGF plays an
important role in angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell
proliferation, migration, and differentiation (24), we hypothesized
that PEITC may inhibit angiogenesis.
We now show that PEITC effectively inhibits in vitro angiogenic
features (capillary-like tube structure formation and migration
potential) of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and
PC-3 cells by causing suppression of proangiogenic growth factor

secretion and inactivation of Akt. We also found that PEITC is a
potent inhibitor of ex vivo angiogenesis in chicken chorioallantoic
membrane (CAM) assay. We propose that inhibition of angiogenesis may be an important mechanism in cancer chemoprevention
by PEITC.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and antibodies. PEITC and D,L-sulforaphane (SFN) were
purchased from LKT Laboratories (St. Paul, MN), whereas benzyl-ITC
(BITC) was obtained from Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Cell culture reagents and
fetal bovine serum (FBS) were purchased from Life Technologies (Grand
Island, NY). An antibody specific for detection of phosphorylated Akt
(Ser473) was from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA), and the
antibodies against total Akt and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGF-R2) were from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Matrigel (growth factor
reduced) was procured from BD PharMingen (Bedford, MA). The ELISA kits
for measurements of VEGF, epidermal growth factor (EGF), granulocyte
colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interleukin-17 (IL-17), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 were from R&D Systems (Minneapolis,
MN) or BioSource (Camarillo, CA). The kit for determination of Akt kinase
activity and Akt-1/2 inhibitor [1,3-dihydro-1-(1-((4-(6-phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinoxalin-7-yl)phenyl)methyl)-4-piperidinyl)-2H-benzimidazol2-one] were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA).
Cell culture and cell survival assay. HUVECs were purchased from
Clonetics (Walkersville, MD) and maintained in endothelial cell growth
medium-2 (EGM2 MV SingleQuots, Clonetics) supplemented with 5% FBS.
Monolayer cultures of PC-3 cells were maintained in F-12K Nutrient Mixture
(Kaighn’s modification) supplemented with 7% (v/v) non–heat-inactivated
FBS and antibiotics. Cells were maintained in an atmosphere of 95% air and
5% CO2 at 37jC. The effect of ITCs on HUVEC viability was determined by
trypan blue dye exclusion assay as described by us previously (25). Stock
solutions of the ITCs were prepared in DMSO and diluted with complete
medium, and an equal volume of DMSO ( final concentration, 0.05%) was
added to the controls.
In vitro capillary-like tube structure formation assay. The effect of
PEITC treatment on in vitro angiogenesis was determined by Matrigel
capillary-like tube structure formation assay as described by us previously
(25). The HUVECs seeded on Matrigel differentiate and form capillary-like
tube structures. Similar to neovascularization (angiogenesis), the tube
formation on Matrigel requires cell-matrix interaction, cellular communication, and cellular motility. To examine the effect of PEITC on in vitro
angiogenesis, HUVECs were seeded in 96-well culture plates precoated
with Matrigel and exposed to different concentrations of PEITC (0.5, 1, and
2 Amol/L) or DMSO (control) for 24 h. The tube formation was visualized
under an inverted microscope. Enclosed network of tube structures from
three randomly chosen fields was scored under a Leica DC300F microscope
(Leica, Cambridge, United Kingdom). In some tube formation experiments,
the HUVECs were exposed to 0.5 Amol/L PEITC for 24 h in the presence or
absence of 1 Amol/L of the Akt-1/2 inhibitor.
In vitro migration (invasion) assay. The effect of PEITC treatment on
in vitro migration (invasion) by HUVEC or PC-3 cells was determined using
Transwell Boyden chamber (Corning, Acton, MA) containing a polycarbonate filter with a pore size of 8 Am as described by us previously (25). Briefly,
0.2 mL HUVEC or PC-3 cell suspension (4  104 cells) in complete medium
was mixed with desired concentrations of PEITC or DMSO (control), and
the suspension was added to the upper compartment of the chamber. The
lower compartment of the chamber contained 0.6 mL of complete medium
containing the same concentrations of PEITC or DMSO. Following
incubation at 37jC for 24 h, the nonmigrant cells from the upper face of
the Transwell membrane were removed using a cotton swab. The
membrane was washed with PBS. The migrated cells on the bottom face
of the membrane were fixed with 90% ethanol and stained with eosin. Three
randomly selected fields were scored for migrated cells. In some migration
assays, HUVECs were treated with 0.5 Amol/L PEITC for 24 h in the
presence or absence of 1 Amol/L Akt-1/2 inhibitor.

ELISA assays for secretion of growth factors, IL-17, and MMPs.
HUVECs or PC-3 cells (2  105) were plated in 24-well plates and allowed to
attach by overnight incubation at 37jC. Cells were treated with desired
concentrations of PEITC or DMSO (control) for 24 h as described above.
Subsequently, the culture medium was collected and used to determine
secretion of VEGF, EGF, G-CSF, IL-17, MMP-2, and MMP-9 using commercially available kits according to the manufacturers’ recommendations.
Akt kinase assay. Akt kinase activity was determined using reagents
supplied by the manufacturer. Briefly, 2  106 HUVECs cultured in the
presence of 1% FBS were plated and allowed to attach by overnight
incubation. The cells were then treated with 4 Amol/L of PEITC or DMSO
(control) for 4 h and lysed with a solution containing 20 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1% Triton
X-100, 2.5 mmol/L sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate,
1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 1 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride. Equal amounts of lysate proteins (300 Ag) from each treatment
group were incubated overnight at 4jC with agarose-coupled anti-Akt
antibody. Immunoprecipitates were washed four times with the lysis buffer
and twice with kinase assay buffer [25 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, 2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, 10 mmol/L
MgCl2]. The immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 40 AL of kinase buffer
supplemented with 200 Amol/L ATP and 1 Ag of glycogen synthase kinase3a/h (GSK-3a/h) fusion protein. After incubation at 30jC for 30 min,
the kinase reaction was terminated with the addition of 40 AL of 2 SDS
sample buffer. An aliquot of the immunoprecipitate (30 AL) was subjected
to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting using anti–phosphorylated
GSK-3a/h (Ser21/9) antibody (25).
Ectopic expression of constitutively active Akt. PC-3 cells were
transiently transfected with pCMV6 vector containing constitutively active
Akt-1 (Myr-Akt1-HA; kindly provided by Dr. Daniel Altschuler, University of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA) or empty vector using Fugene 6 transfection
regent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) according to the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Briefly, PC-3 cells were plated in six-well
plates at a density of 2  105/mL and allowed to attach by overnight
incubation. Cells were transfected with the expression vector encoding
constitutively active Akt (CA-Akt) or empty vector. Twenty-four hours after
transfection, cells were treated with 2 or 4 Amol/L of PEITC or DMSO
(control) for 24 h and processed for immunoblotting of total or
phosphorylated Akt and migration assay.
CAM assay in fertilized chicken eggs. The effect of PEITC on ex vivo
angiogenesis was determined by CAM assay. Briefly, fertilized chicken eggs
were incubated at 37.5jC in a humidified incubator with forced air
circulation. On embryonic day 4, eggs were cracked open and embryos were
carefully transferred into 100-mm Petri dishes to continue their development
in an incubator at 37.5jC with 1.5% CO2. PEITC was mixed with 0.5%
methylcellulose in water. Drops of this solution (10 AL per drop) were allowed
to dry on a Teflon-coated surface forming methylcellulose discs of f2 mm
in diameter. The methylcellulose discs containing different concentrations of
PEITC (5 or 20 nmol/egg) were gently implanted on top of chicken CAM on
embryonic day 6, and the embryos were incubated for 2 more days. The
chicken CAMs were examined on embryonic day 8 and photographed under a
stereomicroscope. Effect of PEITC on angiogenesis was quantitatively
evaluated by scoring vascular density index (VDI) from control and treated
groups. The VDI of each CAM represents the number of intersections made by
the blood vessels with three equidistant concentric circles on the area covered
by methylcellulose discs. The VDI was scored using Image-Pro Plus software.

Results
PEITC treatment decreases viability of HUVEC. To test the
hypothesis that ITCs may inhibit angiogenesis, initially we determined the effects of three widely studied ITC compounds (PEITC,
SFN, and BITC; compare Fig. 1A for structures) on survival of
HUVEC by trypan blue dye exclusion assay, and the results are
summarized in Fig. 1B and C. The viability of HUVEC was decreased
significantly in the presence of PEITC in a concentration- and

compound for further investigation to fully characterize its
antiangiogenic response.
PEITC inhibits capillary-like tube structure network.
Because PEITC treatment significantly decreased HUVEC viability,
we proceeded to test whether PEITC inhibits in vitro angiogenesis.
We explored this possibility by determining the effect of PEITC
treatment on formation of capillary-like tube structures by HUVEC
on growth factor–reduced Matrigel, which is a well-accepted technique to measure in vitro angiogenesis. Figure 2A depicts capillarylike tube structure formation by HUVEC following a 24-h treatment
with DMSO (control) or different concentrations of PEITC. The
capillary-like tube structures were clearly visible in DMSO-treated
control HUVEC. On the other hand, PEITC treatment caused
disruption of the capillary-like tube network in a concentrationdependent manner (Fig. 2A). Capillary-like tube structures were
scored from control and PEITC-treated samples, and the results
are summarized in Fig. 2B. The formation of capillary-like tube
structures was inhibited by about 54% and 75% in the presence of
0.5 and 1 Amol/L of PEITC, respectively, compared with control
(Fig. 2B). The capillary-like tube structure formation by HUVEC
was completely abolished (100% inhibition) in the presence of

time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The viability of HUVEC was also
decreased significantly on treatment with SFN and BITC, but the
IC50 for these ITC analogues was between 3- and 10-fold higher
compared with that for PEITC. These results suggested that even a
subtle change in ITC structure (e.g., the alkyl chain length in PEITC
versus BITC) could have a significant effect on its antiangiogenic
activity. Because of higher potency of PEITC against HUVEC
proliferation compared with BITC or SFN, we focused on this

2 Amol/L PEITC (Fig. 2A). These results indicated that PEITC
treatment inhibited formation of capillary-like tube structures by
HUVEC.
PEITC inhibits HUVEC migration. Next, we determined the
effect of PEITC treatment on invasion potential (migration) of
HUVEC using a modified Boyden Chamber assay. Figure 3A depicts
eosin-stained images of migrated HUVEC. In DMSO-treated
controls, a large fraction of HUVEC migrated to the bottom face
of the membrane, which was decreased markedly in the presence of
PEITC. For instance, compared with DMSO-treated control, the
migration potential of HUVEC was inhibited by about 58%, 72%,
81%, and 99% in the presence of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 Amol/L of PEITC,
respectively (Fig. 3B). These results indicated that the migration by
HUVEC was inhibited significantly in the presence of PEITC.
PEITC treatment suppresses VEGF secretion and VEGF-R2
protein level in HUVEC. VEGF plays an important role in
angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation, migration,
and differentiation (24). To gain insights into the mechanism by
which PEITC inhibits in vitro angiogenesis, we determined its effect
on VEGF secretion and the results are shown in Fig. 4A. The PEITC
treatment caused a dose-dependent and statistically significant
decrease in VEGF secretion into the medium. For instance, relative
to DMSO-treated control, the secretion of VEGF into the medium
was inhibited by about 45%, 62%, and 65% on a 24-h treatment with

1, 2, and 4 Amol/L of PEITC, respectively (Fig. 4A). The VEGFmediated prosurvival signal transduction to the nucleus is caused
by its interaction with receptors, including VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, and
VEGF-R3. Of the three receptors, VEGF-R2 is believed to play an
important role in angiogenesis. Next, we tested the possibility
whether PEITC-mediated inhibition of HUVEC migration and
tube formation was caused by a decrease in the protein level of
VEGF-R2. As can be seen in Fig. 4B, PEITC treatment caused a
time-dependent decrease in the levels of VEGF-R2 protein. The
PEITC-mediated down-regulation of VEGF-R2 protein was evident
as early as 2 h after treatment and increased progressively with
increasing drug exposure time (Fig. 4B, top).
PEITC treatment causes inactivation of Akt in HUVEC. Akt
(also known as protein kinase B) is implicated in promotion of
endothelial cell survival and VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell
migration and differentiation (26–29). Activation of Akt is mediated
by receptor tyrosine kinase–mediated phosphorylation (30). The
Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt occurs in response to growth factor
stimulus and is necessary for its activation (reviewed in ref. 30).
As can be seen in Fig. 4B (bottom), a 4-h treatment of HUVEC
with 4 Amol/L PEITC caused a marked decrease in kinase activity
of Akt as determined by immunoprecipitation-kinase assay using
GSK-3a/h as a substrate. To further examine the relationship
between PEITC-mediated suppression of angiogenesis and Akt
inactivation, we did tube formation assay in HUVEC exposed to
0.5 Amol/L PEITC in the presence or absence of a selective inhibitor of Akt-1/2 (31, 32). The Akt-1/2 inhibitor used in the present
study is cell active and blocks phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 and
Ser473 and reduces the level of active Akt in human prostate cancer
LNCaP cells (31, 32), human cervical carcinoma C33A cells (31),
human breast carcinoma MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cells (32), and
human colon cancer HT29 cells (32). As can be seen in Fig. 4C, the
capillary-like tube structure formation by HUVEC was inhibited by
about 33% and 54% on a 24-h treatment with 0.5 Amol/L PEITC
and 1 Amol/L of Akt-1/2 inhibitor alone, respectively. On the other
hand, combined treatment of HUVEC with PEITC and Akt-1/2
inhibitor resulted in near complete loss of capillary-like tube
network (Fig. 4C). We determined the effects of PEITC and/or
Akt-1/2 inhibitor on HUVEC migration (invasion potential), and
the results are shown in Fig. 4D. Similar to tube formation assay,
combined treatment of HUVEC with PEITC (0.5 Amol/L) and
Akt-1/2 inhibitor (1 Amol/L) resulted in a much greater inhibition
of migration compared with single agent alone. Together, these
results indicated that the PEITC-mediated inhibition of HUVEC
capillary-like tube formation and migration was mediated by sup-

pression of VEGF secretion and VEGF-R2 protein level and
inactivation of Akt.
PEITC treatment inhibits PC-3 cell migration. Cell migration
and invasion are fundamental to tumor metastasis (33). Next, we
raised the question of whether PEITC-mediated suppression of
migration (Fig. 3) was an effect restricted to endothelial cells

Figure 5. A, percentage of PC-3 migration following a 24-h exposure to the

(HUVEC). We addressed this question by determining the effect of
PEITC treatment on migration potential of PC-3 human prostate
cancer cells, and the results are shown in Fig. 5A. Similar to
HUVEC, migration by PC-3 cells was inhibited significantly in the
presence of PEITC in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A).
The PEITC-mediated suppression of PC-3 cell migration correlated
with a decrease in phosphorylated Akt (active Akt) level, which was
clearly evident at 16 and 24 h after treatment (Fig. 5B). Inhibition
of Ser473 phosphorylation of Akt by PEITC treatment was dose
dependent (results not shown). These results suggested that
PEITC-mediated inhibition of PC-3 cell migration might be caused
by inactivation of Akt.
Ectopic expression of CA-Akt attenuates PEITC-mediated
suppression of PC-3 cell migration. To firmly establish the role of
Akt in our model, we determined the effect of overexpression of
CA-Akt on PEITC-mediated inhibition of PC-3 cell migration. Cells
transfected with the empty vector were used as control. Overexpression of CA-Akt in transfected PC-3 cells was confirmed by
immunoblotting using antibodies against total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473). As can be seen in Fig. 5C, the levels of total Akt
and phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) were markedly higher in PC-3 cells
transfected with CA-Akt compared with empty vector–transfected
control cells. As expected, ectopic expression of CA-Akt potentiated PC-3 cell migration when compared with empty vector–
transfected control cells (Fig. 5D). Similar to untransfected PC-3
cells (Fig. 5A), PEITC treatment inhibited migration in vectortransfected control PC-3 cells in a concentration-dependent
manner (Fig. 5D). The PEITC-mediated inhibition of PC-3 cell
migration was statistically significantly attenuated by ectopic
expression of CA-Akt compared with empty vector–transfected
control cells (Fig. 5D). These results confirmed that Akt was a
critical determinant of PEITC-mediated inhibition of PC-3 cell
migration.
PEITC treatment suppresses VEGF, EGF, and G-CSF secretion by PC-3 cells. Angiogenic potential of cancer cells is regulated
by multiple growth factors, cytokines, and MMPs (24, 34–37). We
therefore determined the levels of VEGF, EGF, G-CSF, IL-17, MMP-2,
and MMP-9 in medium from PC-3 cells cultured for 24 h in the
presence of 0.01% DMSO (control) or 2, 4, and 8 Amol/L of PEITC.
Compared with DMSO-treated control, secretion of VEGF was
decreased by about 32% and 59% in the presence of 4 and 8 Amol/L
of PEITC, respectively. Similarly, secretion of EGF and G-CSF was
reduced by 27% and 30% in the presence of 4 Amol/L PEITC and by
32% and 50% in the presence of 8 Amol/L PEITC, respectively,
compared with DMSO-treated control (P < 0.05 between DMSO
control and PEITC group by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s
test). On the other hand, PEITC treatment did not have any
appreciable effect on secretion of IL-17, MMP-2, or MMP-9 (results
not shown). The results indicated that PEITC treatment decreased
levels of VEGF, EGF, and G-CSF in PC-3 cells.
PEITC treatment inhibits ex vivo angiogenesis in CAM
assay. We used an ex vivo CAM assay to further examine
antiangiogenic effect of PEITC. The concentrations of the PEITC
for CAM assay were selected from preliminary dose-finding studies
and were well within the PEITC concentrations effective against
PC-3 xenograft growth in nude mice in vivo (21). We have shown
previously that PC-3 xenograft growth in nude mice is significantly
inhibited by p.o. administration ( five times weekly) of 12 Amol

have any appreciable effect on VDI. These results confirmed antiangiogenic potential of PEITC through an ex vivo assay.

Discussion
The present study reveals that PEITC inhibits angiogenic
features of HUVEC in vitro as revealed by capillary-like tube
formation and migration (invasion) assays. In addition, PEITC
treatment significantly inhibits neovascularization ex vivo in
CAM assay. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is
the first published report to document inhibition of angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo by PEITC. Statistically significant
inhibition of HUVEC capillary-like tube structure formation
(Fig. 2) and migration (Fig. 3) by PEITC is evident at concentrations (<1 Amol/L) well within the pharmacologically achievable
range. For example, the maximal plasma concentration of PEITC
(C max) following ingestion of 100 g watercress was shown to
vary between 673 and 1,155 nmol/L (mean, 928 F 250 nmol/L;
ref. 38). A mean C max of 1.04 F 0.22 Amol/L of total ITC in three
subjects taking a single dose of PEITC (40 mg) has been noted
in another study (39). We propose that inhibition of angiogenesis
may be an important mechanism in cancer chemoprevention by
PEITC.
VEGF is a proangiogenic growth factor most closely associated
with aggressive human cancer cells (40). VEGF provides prosurvival
signals to normal and tumor-derived endothelial cells (24), and this
signal transduction to the nucleus is mediated by VEGF receptors,
including VEGF-R1, VEGF-R2, and VEGF-R3. Whereas VEGF-R2 is
believed to play an important role in angiogenesis, VEGF-R3 is
responsible for lymphangiogenesis. VEGF-R2 is a receptor tyrosine
kinase, which, on activation by ligand binding, phosphorylates
and activates secondary messengers, including Akt, to regulate
endothelial cell proliferation and migration (41). The present study
reveals that exposure of HUVEC to PEITC results in suppression of
VEGF secretion to the medium (Fig. 4A) as well as down-regulation
of VEGF-R2 protein level (Fig. 4B). The PEITC-mediated suppression of VEGF secretion is not restricted to HUVEC because similar
effects are evident in PC-3 cells. Together, these results suggest
that the PEITC-mediated inhibition of in vitro angiogenic features of HUVEC is most likely caused by suppression of VEGF and
VEGF-R2.
Although the mechanism by which PEITC causes suppression of
VEGF and VEGF-R2 expression in HUVECs or PC-3 cells remains to
be elucidated, several possibilities exist to explain these effects. For
instance, several transcription factors, including hypoxia-inducible
factor (HIF)-1a, NF-nB, activator protein-1, and Sp-1, bind to the
VEGF promoter to initiate and activate its transcription (reviewed
in ref. 42). Likewise, HIF-2a is highly expressed by vascular
endothelial cells and activates the transcription of endothelial cell–
specific receptor tyrosine kinases and VEGF-R2 (42). It is possible
that PEITC inhibits transcriptional activity of some of these
transcription factors to suppress VEGF and VEGF-R2 expression.
Suppression of NF-nB and NF-nB–regulated gene expression by
PEITC treatment has been documented in human prostate cancer
cells (23). We have also shown previously that BITC, a close
structural analogue of PEITC, inhibits activity of NF-nB in human
pancreatic cancer cells (43). Recent studies have also implicated
reactive oxygen species in EGF-mediated regulation of VEGF and
HIF-1a expression (44). Because PEITC is an antioxidant (9), the
possibility that suppression of VEGF expression by this agent is

www.aacrjournals.org

linked to its antioxidative effect cannot be ignored and warrants
further investigation.
Serine-threonine kinase Akt, a homologue of a retroviral
oncoprotein v-Akt, is recruited during signal transduction from
growth factor receptors and intracellular pathways (28). Vascular
homeostasis and angiogenesis by different stimuli, including VEGF
and angiopoietin-1, is regulated by the activation of Akt (28).
Overexpression of CA-Akt and its upstream kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) has been shown to induce angiogenesis
in chicken embryo (29). The expression of VEGF in endothelial
cells is also regulated by the PI3K-Akt signaling axis (29). Akt
activation not only promotes endothelial cell survival but also
regulates vasomotor responses via phosphorylation of endothelial
nitric oxide synthase and VEGF-stimulated endothelial cell
migration and differentiation (27–30, 45). The present study reveals
that the antiangiogenic effect of PEITC is closely associated with
inhibition of Akt kinase. This conclusion is based on the following observations: (a) PEITC treatment causes inhibition of Akt
kinase in HUVEC as revealed by immunoprecipitation-kinase assay
using GSK-3a/h as a substrate (Fig. 4B) and in PC-3 cells as
revealed by immunoblotting for Ser473 phosphorylated (activated)
Akt (Fig. 5B), (b) PEITC-mediated inhibition of HUVEC capillarylike tube structure formation and migration is potentiated in the
presence of cell-permeable and selective inhibitor of Akt-1/2
(Fig. 4C and D), and (c) PEITC-mediated suppression of PC-3 cell
migration is statistically significantly attenuated by ectopic expression of CA-Akt (Fig. 5D). Activation of Akt is mediated by receptor
tyrosine kinases that, on ligand binding, are autophosphorylated and cause activation of PI3K (30). Activated PI3K generates
lipid second messengers, which facilitate recruitment of Akt to
the plasma membrane for its activation (30). It is possible that
PEITC treatment causes inhibition of PI3K to inhibit Ser473
phosphorylation (activation) of Akt. It was shown recently that
cellular responses to PEITC in Caco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cell line are attenuated in the presence of PI3K inhibitor
LY294002 (46).
Recent studies have implicated multiple growth factors and
cytokines, including VEGF, EGF, G-CSF, and IL-17, in tumor
angiogenesis and growth (24, 35–37, 47). For instance, IL-17
increases angiogenic activity and in vivo growth of human non–
small lung cancer cells in severe combined immunodeficient mice
(37). Similarly, G-CSF promotes tumor angiogenesis by increasing
circulating endothelial progenitor cells (47). Degradation of extracellular matrix is a critical component of tumor metastasis (48, 49).
Degradation of extracellular matrix is orchestrated by MMPs,
which are zinc-dependent proteolytic enzymes (48, 49). Type IV
collagen, a basic component of extracellular matrix, is degraded by
MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and MMP-9 (gelatinase B; ref. 48). MMP-2 in
particular is believed to have an important role in the initial steps
of tumor invasion (49). Expression of MMPs is associated with
grade and stage of solid tumors (50). The present study reveals that
PEITC treatment significantly inhibits secretion of VEGF, EGF, and
G-CSF, but not IL-17, by PC-3 cells. Thus, it is reasonable to
conclude that suppression of growth factor secretion may
exacerbate antiangiogenic effect of PEITC. On the other hand,
PEITC treatment does not affect secretion of either MMP-2 or
MMP-9.
In conclusion, the present study shows that PEITC is a potent
inhibitor of angiogenesis in vitro and ex vivo. It is important to note
that the PEITC-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis occurs at concentrations achievable by dietary intervention or pharmacologic

administration. The PEITC-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis
and migration is associated with inactivation of Akt, suppression of
proangiogenic growth factors, and down-regulation of VEGF-R2
protein expression. We are tempted to speculate that inhibition of
angiogenesis may be an important mechanism in overall scheme of
PEITC-mediated cancer prevention.
