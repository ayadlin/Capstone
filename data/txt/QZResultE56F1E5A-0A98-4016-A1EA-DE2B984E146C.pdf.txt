Abstract
Chemotherapy has improved the survival of patients with
gastric cancer by unknown mechanisms. In this study, we showed
that cisplatin and docetaxel used in gastric cancer treatment
increase the expression of miRNA-29 (miR-29) family members
and decrease the expression of their oncogenic targets, mediating
a signiﬁcant part of the efﬁcacious beneﬁts of these chemotherapeutic agents. In particular, patients with gastric cancer who
experienced recurrences after chemotherapy tended to exhibit low
levels of miR-29c expression in their tumors, suggesting that miR29c activation may contribute to the chemotherapeutic efﬁcacy.

Enforced expression of miR-29s in gastric cancer cells inhibited
cell invasion in vitro and in vivo by directly targeting catenin-d
(CTNND1). Drug treatment suppressed gastric cancer cell invasion by restoring miR-29c–mediated suppression of catenin-d and
RhoA signaling. In parallel, drug treatment also activated several
tumor-suppressive miRNAs, thereby decreasing expression of
their oncogenic effector targets. Overall, our ﬁndings deﬁned a
global mechanism for understanding the efﬁcacious effects of
cytotoxic chemotherapy in gastric cancer. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1332–44.

Introduction
Gastric cancer is the fourth most common cancer, and its
prognosis remains poor despite adequate surgery with radical
lymphadenectomy (1). Most patients with gastric cancer demonstrate locally advanced disease at the time of diagnosis and may
also require chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy (1–2). Recent
studies have demonstrated an advantage for perioperative chemotherapy compared with surgery (3). However, the molecular
mechanisms of chemotherapeutic drugs used for gastric cancer
treatment are not well established.
MicroRNAs (miRNA) play critical roles in multiple biologic
processes by regulating mRNAs via cleavage or translational
repression (4). The loss of homeostasis in the miRNA/mRNA
axis leads to relevant pathologic events, including gastric carcinogenesis (5). Therefore, miRNAs could serve as potential biomarkers for gastric cancer clinical diagnosis and prevention. The
microRNA-29 (miR-29) family consists of three members (miR29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c) and has been shown to suppress
cancer cell growth (6–9). Our previous study indicated that miR29s suppressed gastric cancer cell proliferation or invasiveness via
targeting CCND2 or MMP2, implying its tumor-suppressive role
(10). However, the impact of miR-29s on gastric cancer cell
metastasis and the corresponding mechanisms is not well established. Recently, Saito and colleagues reported that miR-29c could
be activated by celecoxib, suggesting that selective COX2 inhibitors may hold promise for gastric cancer treatment by restoring
miR-29c (11). These ﬁndings suggested that miR-29s not only
functioned as ts-miRs in gastric cancer but also might serve as
effective predictors for gastric cancer prevention.
Herein, we identify miR-29c as a potential biomarker for predicting the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer who receive

chemotherapy. We further ﬁnd that miR-29s act as metastasis
suppressors by directly targeting catenin-d (CTNND1) in gastric
cancer. Moreover, we demonstrate that chemotherapeutic drugs
represent their suppressive impact on gastric cancer cell invasion
via remodifying the miR-29c–mediated catenin-d/GTP Rho axis.

one-way ANOVA. All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSS 16.0 software (SPSS Inc.). P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
miR-29 expression is activated by cisplatin and docetaxel in
gastric cancer cells
To elucidate the role of miR-29 in gastric cancer chemotherapy,
we determined their expression in gastric cancer cells treated with
cisplatin or docetaxel. qRT-PCR analysis was performed to effectively discriminate miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c expression
(Supplementary Fig. S1A–S1D) and then applied to evaluate their
levels in gastric cancer cell lines, showing that miR-29 levels
depicted signiﬁcant reduction (Fig.1A). We next treated MGC803
and HGC27 cells, which have low miR-29s expression, with
cisplatin and docetaxel (0–103 mg/L), and the estimated IC50
values in these cell lines were 0.9 and 0.09 mg/L for cisplatin in
MGC803 and HGC27 cells, respectively, and 0.008 and 0.0009
mg/L for docetaxel in MGC803 and HGC27 cells, respectively
(Fig. 1B and C). Further qRT-PCR analysis indicated that miR29 expression was augmented following cisplatin and docetaxel
treatment (Fig. 1D and E). Moreover, we observed that MCL1
and BCL2, which are validated miR-29s targets (6, 16), were
decreased in drug-treated gastric cancer cells (Fig. 1F and G).
These ﬁndings suggested that chemotherapy may hold clinical
promise for gastric cancer treatment through regulating miR29–mediated program.
Deregulated miR-29c expression is associated with gastric
cancer progression and survival
We next investigated the correlation between miR-29 and
gastric cancer development. qRT-PCR was used to assess miR29 levels in tissues from 166 cases of gastric cancer, and we found
that miR-29a, miR-29b, and miR-29c were signiﬁcantly downregulated in the majority of gastric cancer tissues examined when
compared with matched normal gastric tissues (Fig. 2A). The
association between miR-29 expression and histologic grade
was explored, and no signiﬁcant difference was found between
well- and poorly differentiated gastric cancer tissues (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). However, we observed that miR-29c downregulation was correlated with a more extensive venous invasion
(P ¼ 0.02; Fig. 2B) and a more aggressive tumor phenotype (P ¼

0.05; Fig. 2C). No clear relationship was observed between
decreased miR-29a or miR-29b expression and worse prognosis
in patients with gastric cancer (Supplementary Fig. S2D and S2E).
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was then conducted on the basis
of cutoff values determined using receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves, which demonstrated that higher miR-29c levels
in patients were correlated with longer disease-free survival
(DFS; Fig. 2D–F; Supplementary Table S2).
We further investigated whether chemotherapy held better clinical promise for patients with gastric cancer with higher miR-29
expression in tumors. Follow-up studies were performed with 66
cases of patients with gastric cancer undergoing chemotherapy after
resection, and these patients were divided into 2 groups based on
recurrence 3 years after treatment. We observed that the tumors of
patients with gastric cancer who underwent recurrence had lower
miR-29c levels (Fig. 2G; Supplementary Fig. S2F).
Altogether, these results suggest that miR-29c is involved in
gastric cancer development and may serve as an effective predictor
for the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer receiving
chemotherapy.
miR-29 suppresses gastric cancer cell migration and invasion
in vitro
Given the parallels between miR-29c and metastatic potential,
we next investigated the role of miR-29 in gastric cancer cell
movement. miR-29s were overexpressed in MGC803 and HGC27
cells (Supplementary Fig. S3), and wound-healing assays were
performed to assess gastric cancer cell migration. Scramble-treated
MGC803 cells completely sealed linear scratch wounds between
12 and 36 hours after injury, whereas miR-29s–treated MGC803
cells sealed only about 70% of the wound area after 36 hours
(Fig. 3A). Similar results were observed in HGC27 cells (Fig. 3B).
In vitro invasion assays were also conducted to evaluate gastric
cancer cell metastasis and demonstrated that miR-29s signiﬁcantly decreased invasive gastric cancer cells compared with scrambletreated cells (Fig. 3C and D).
miR-29c inhibits gastric cancer cell metastasis in vivo
To conﬁrm the in vitro ﬁndings, we conducted in vivo metastasis
assays. In doing so, 5  105 viable HGC27 cells infected with
Lenti-mir-29c (Lenti-29c) or Lenti-scramble (Lenti-scr) were
resuspended in 0.1-mL PBS and injected into the lateral tail veins
of nude mice. Five weeks after injection, the animals were

GAPDH served as a loading control and data were normalized by Anti-con (negative control oligonucleotide)-treated gastric cancer cells. E and F, cisplatin and

sacriﬁced, and the lungs and liver were dissected for microscopic
histology. The number of liver metastases in mice injected with
Lenti-29c-infected HGC27 cells was signiﬁcantly lower than that in
mice injected with Lenti-scr-infected cells (Fig. 3E and F). Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was also performed to assess the
pathologic properties of the liver tissues, which showed more
metastatic nodules in Lenti-scr–treated than in Lenti-29c–treated
mice (Fig. 3G). Similar results were observed with H&E staining in
the lung tissues, although we did not observe signiﬁcant changes in
outward appearance (Fig. 3H).
Catenin-d is a direct target of miR-29
To identify mRNA targets of miR-29s relevant to gastric cancer
cell invasion, we interrogated the TargetScan (17) and miRanda
(18) miRNA target prediction programs. Catenin-d was identiﬁed
as a possible target of miR-29s and encodes a member of the
armadillo protein family, which functions in adhesion between
cells and signal transduction (19). The 30 UTR of catenin-d houses a
sequence that matches the seed sequence contained in miR-29
(Fig. 4A). Transfection of the catenin-d-30 UTR-luciferase reporter
in combination with miR-29 mimics in 293T cells revealed that
miR-29 repressed the luciferase activity of this reporter. Moreover,
mutation of miR-29 sites abrogated this reduction in luciferase
activity (Fig. 4B). Furthermore, elevating miR-29s in HGC27 or
MGC803 cells reduced the catenin-d protein level (Fig. 4C),
whereas diminishing miR-29 activity using speciﬁc inhibitors
(anti-29) resulted in increased catenin-d expression (Fig. 4D,
Supplementary Fig. S4). Because cisplatin and docetaxel treatment led to an increase of miR-29 levels in gastric cancer cells and
catenin-d is a miR-29s target, catenin-d level may be decreased in
gastric cancer cells treated by these drugs. Immunoblotting analysis conﬁrmed this hypothesis (Fig. 4E and F). Moreover, loss of
the predominant membrane localization of catenin-d and gain of
cytosolic or nuclear catenin-d labeling closely correlated with
cancer invasion (20–21). Therefore, we further analyzed the levels
of catenin-d in the cytoplasm via immunostaining. Compared
with scramble-treated cells, HGC27 cells transfected with miR-29
mimics demonstrated a signiﬁcant decrease in catenin-d expression (Fig. 4G).
We also validated the miR-29c–mediated catenin-d axis in
xenograft mouse tumors. miR-29c was overexpressed in HGC27
cells using a lentivirus and subsequent cell growth analysis indicated that miR-29c restoration suppressed HGC27 cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited gastric cancer tumor formation in vivo
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Immunohistochemical analysis was
performed in randomly selected xenograft mouse tumors, which
showed that Lenti-29c–injected tumors expressed lower levels of
catenin-d than the controls. Ki-67 and caspase-3 expression analysis demonstrated that miR-29c retarded gastric cancer cell growth
(Fig. 4H and I). These data indicated that catenin-d was a functional target of miR-29 in gastric cancer.
Catenin-d is upregulated in gastric cancer tissues with low levels
of miR-29
We next investigated whether catenin-d was expressed at a
higher level in gastric cancer tissues with downregulated
miR-29s. qRT-PCR and immunoblots were conducted for 20 pairs
of gastric cancer tissues, demonstrating that the levels of miR-29
were decreased in these tissues (Fig. 4J; Supplementary Fig. S6A).
In addition, catenin-d expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated in
the same specimens shown by immunoblots (Fig. 4K; Supple-

1338 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

mentary Fig. S6B). Catenin-d staining was also increased in gastric
cancer tissues shown by immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 4L;
Supplementary Fig. S7). These ﬁndings indicated a signiﬁcant
inverse correlation between miR-29 and catenin-d expression.
Silencing catenin-d decreases gastric cancer cell migration and
invasion
Of note, loss of E-cadherin leads to catenin-d mislocalization in
the cytoplasm and disrupts its interaction with Rho GTPases and
subsequent promotion of cell metastasis(22). Because the miR29/catenin-d axis was established in gastric cancer cells, we reasoned that silencing catenin-d should retard the ability of gastric
cancer cells to seal scratch wounds. As predicted, si_catenind–treated HGC27 cells sealed wounds at a slower rate compared
with si_Con treatment (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, in vitro invasion
assay was used to assess the effects of catenin-d on HGC27 cell
metastasis, demonstrating that si_catenin-d treatment resulted in
a signiﬁcant decrease in invasive cells (Fig. 5B).
To further probe the correlation between cell phenotypic alterations and the miR-29/catenin-d axis, we performed a rescue assay
that increased and then decreased the level of catenin-d via antimiR-29 in combination with si_catenin-d, as described (12).
Immunoblotting was used to evaluate catenin-d expression and
demonstrated that the level of catenin-d was altered under
different co-transfection conditions in HGC27 cells (Fig. 5C).
Furthermore, in vitro invasion assay was conducted to better
determine alterations in cell motility corresponding with catenin-d protein level variations, and we observed that silencing
catenin-d to prevent induction by anti-29 treatment led to an
increase in invasive cells (Fig. 5D and E).
Downregulation of catenin-d decreases F-actin via Rho GTP
activation
We next investigated the role of catenin-d in the formation of
ﬁlamentous actin (F-actin). HGC27 cells were transfected with
either si_catenin-d or si_Con for 48 hours, and immunostaining
was performed. As expected, silencing catenin-d markedly suppressed actin organization, which was demonstrated by phalloidin staining compared with si_Con-treated cells (Fig. 5F and G).
The above ﬁndings prompted us to explore the possible
mechanisms controlling this process. Because cytosolic catenind dampens the activity of small Rho family GTPases and evokes
cell migration, we examined the status of activated Rho in HGC27
cells treated with si_catenin-d using a GST fusion protein containing the Rho-binding domain of mouse Rhotekin. Immunoblotting revealed that si_catenin-d resulted in a signiﬁcant decrease in
catenin-d protein, and the level of activated RhoA was increased in
si_catenin-d-treated HGC27 cells compared with cells treated
with si_Con (Fig. 5H). We further evaluated the expression of
coﬁlin, a major downstream target of RhoA (23) and observed an
increase in p-Coﬁlin following 48-hour treatment of HGC27 cells
with si_catenin-d, although no signiﬁcant change was observed in
total coﬁlin levels (Fig. 5H).
miR-29s increase F-actin and p-Coﬁlin via activated Rho
We next used an alternative approach to downregulate catenind, based on the fact that catenin-d is a direct target of miR-29s in
gastric cancer cells. Immunoblotting revealed that miR-29 treatment resulted in a decrease in catenin-d protein levels as well as an
increase in activated RhoA and p-Coﬁlin compared with the scr
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S5I). We also explored whether the

miRNA-29c Predicting Gastric Cancer Chemotherapy

upregulation of miR-29 had a similar effect on actin organization as
silencing catenin-d in gastric cancer cells. Immunostaining analysis
was conducted and showed that miR-29 restoration resulted in
decreased actin organization in HGC27 cells (Fig. 5J and K).
These results demonstrate that miR-29 regulates gastric cancer
cell movement by suppressing the catenin-d pathway.
Cytotoxic drug treatment suppresses gastric cancer cell
movement via regulating miR-29c–mediated catenin-d axis
To investigate whether cytotoxic drugs represented their
suppressive effect on gastric cancer cell movement, a series of
rescue assays was conducted. In doing so, miR-29c inhibitor was
transfected into gastric cancer cells after cisplatin and docetaxel
treatment to re-modify the miR-29c–mediated catenin-d axis.
qRT-PCR analysis revealed that cisplatin and docetaxel treatment
led to an increase of miR-29c expression and this upregulation
was dampened by anti-29c (Fig. 6 A and B). We also observed that
catenin-d protein was decreased upon drugs treatment and
increased with anti-29c transfection shown by immunoblots (Fig.
6C and D). The following wound-healing assay and in vitro
invasion assay indicated that miR-29c inhibition to prevent its
induction by cisplatin or docetaxel treatment led to increased cell
movement (Fig. 6E–G). These ﬁndings suggest that the miR-29c–
mediated catenin-d axis is a target of cytotoxic drugs in gastric
cancer cells.
Clinical correlation among miR-29c, catenin-d, and tumor
progression in patients with gastric cancer
We further probed the clinical correlations among miR-29c,
catenin-d, and the TNM stage of patients with gastric cancer.
Expression analyses of miR-29c and catenin-d were conducted
with formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) tissues from the
66 cases of gastric cancer mentioned above. qRT-PCR analysis
indicated that miR-29c level was signiﬁcantly decreased in majority of the examined gastric cancer samples (Supplementary Fig.
S8A–S8C). Catenin-d protein in these FFPE tissues was evaluated
by immunohistochemical staining, demonstrating a signiﬁcant
inverse correlation between miR-29c and catenin-d (Supplementary Fig. S8F and Supplementary Table S4; miR-29c, R2 ¼ 0.3382,
P < 0.0001). We also observed that patients with gastric cancer
with venous metastasis tended to express high levels of catenin-d
(Fig. 7A and B). Moreover, gastric cancer tissues with low levels of
miR-29c demonstrated increased catenin-d protein levels (Fig. 7C
and D). Furthermore, in-depth statistical analysis indicated an
inverse association between miR-29c and catenin-d and the TNM
stage (Fig. 7E).
Together, these ﬁndings indicate that miR-29c is an independent prognostic factor of gastric cancer development.
Drug-activating ts-miR represents a crucial mechanism for
gastric cancer chemotherapy
The above ﬁndings prompted us to further investigate the effect
of chemotherapy on other ts-miR validated in gastric carcinogen-

esis. HGC27 and MGC803 cells were treated with docetaxel and
cisplatin, and qRT-PCR was performed to measure the expression
of selected ts-miR in these cells. The results indicated that most tsmiR were upregulated in gastric cancer cells upon docetaxel or
cisplatin treatment (Fig. 7F). miR-375, which was validated as a tsmiR in gastric cancer by negatively regulating PDK1 and YWHAZ
(24), was the most signiﬁcant of the increased miRNA. We also
demonstrated that cisplatin and docetaxel treatment led to a
marked decrease in PDK1 and YWHAZ protein in gastric cancer
cells (Fig. 7G and H). These data suggest that chemotherapeutic
drugs may contribute to gastric cancer treatment via miR-375–
mediated axes.
Altogether, our ﬁndings suggest that multiple gastric carcinogenesis–related programs, including the ts-miR–mediated axis,
are involved in the response to chemotherapy.

Discussion
Our data revealed that miR-29 suppressed gastric cancer cell
invasion, suggesting that miR-29s levels might be correlated with
gastric cancer progression. To test this hypothesis, miR-29 expression analysis was conducted in 166 cases of gastric cancer tissues,
demonstrating that gastric cancer tissues with poor differentiation
tended to have low miR-29 levels, albeit statistically insigniﬁcant
(miR-29a, P ¼ 0.84; miR-29b, P ¼ 0.27; miR-29c, P ¼ 0.90;
Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2C). These data are not in agreement
with Saito's report of 23 cases of gastric cancer tissues (14 differentiated and 9 undifferentiated; ref. 11). However, we observed
that miR-29c levels were dramatically decreased in patients with
gastric cancer with more aggressive tumor phenotypes, indicating
that miR-29c may represent the most vital tumor suppressor in
this family.
Our data also elucidated that catenin-d is a novel target of
miR-29s and loss of miR-29c/catenin-d homeostasis contributed to gastric cancer progression. Moreover, the miR-29c–mediated catenin-d axis is chemotherapeutic target of cytotoxic drugs
in gastric cancer cells. Actually, catenin-d is a complicated
protein and its function as tumor suppressor or oncogene
depends on the subcellular localization(25). Accumulating
reports demonstrate that catenin-d is essential for adhesiveness
in epithelial tissues, as well as increased protein stability and a
reduction in E-cadherin turnover at the plasma membrane
thereby function as tumor suppressor (26). Recent studies in
vitro or in vivo conﬁrm this idea (27–29). Because cisplatin and
docetaxel treatment led to a decrease of catenin-d proteins via
modulating miR-29 expression, we next investigated whether
these drugs held impact on E-cadherin levels. Our immunoblotting analysis indicated a signiﬁcant increase of E-cadherin
proteins in cell surface and cytoplasm but did not detect the
expression of E-cadherin in nucleus of gastric cancer cells with
drugs treatment (Supplementary Fig. S9A and S9B). Meanwhile,
miR-29c treatment resulted in a moderated increase of E-cadherin proteins in cell surface and cytoplasm (Supplementary

Fig. S9C and S9D). These data suggest that chemotherapeutic
drugs lead to an increase of E-cadherin on cell surface probably
via other unknown mechanism except via the miR-29c/catenind axis through comparing the effect of cytotoxic drugs to miR29c treatment. As stated above, mislocalization of catenin-d in
the cytoplasm or nucleus resulted in the promotion of migration and invasion via regulating Rho GTPase activity and growth
factor receptor signaling, implying its role as an oncogene (30,
31). Interestingly, our immunostaining analysis indicated a

dramatic decrease of catenin-d protein levels in the cytoplasm
of gastric cancer cells treated with miR-29 mimics, suggesting
that mislocalized catenin-d functions as an oncogene.
The importance and mechanism of cancer chemotherapy have
been extensively investigated. With the emergence of miRNA
research, many groups have attempted to identify miRNA signatures associated with chemosensitivity or chemoresistance. In this
study, miR-29s were validated as responsive ts-miR in gastric
cancer chemotherapy. These data promoted us to further

miRNA-29c Predicting Gastric Cancer Chemotherapy

investigate whether cytotoxic drugs held clinical promise through
modulating a group of ts-miR or oncomiR in gastric cancer cells.
To expand the scope of our ﬁndings, 22 known ts-miRs were
selected and measured by qRT-PCR in cisplatin- and docetaxeltreated gastric cancer cells. As expected, most of these miRNAs
were upregulated, suggesting that chemotherapeutic drugs
achieve clinical promise for gastric cancer prevention through
activating ts-miR, which may represent a global mechanism for
gastric cancer chemotherapy. In addition, a previous study
reported that the miR-29c levels were increased in gastric cancer
cells following celecoxib treatment (11). In contrast to this study,
another blocking agent for gastrointestinal tumors treatment,
imatinib, was used to treat gastric cancer cells and led to a
signiﬁcant increase in miR-29c expression and a marked decrease
in catenin-d protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S10), suggesting that selective inhibitors may exert similar effects on gastric
cancer treatment through the miR-29c–mediated axis. These
ﬁndings demonstrate that miR-29c acts as not only a critical
predictor of gastric cancer chemotherapy but also a powerful
ts-miR for gastric cancer.
In conclusion, our ﬁndings indicate that loss of miR-29c/
catenin-d homeostasis contributes to gastric cancer progression.
Re-modiﬁcation of the miR-29c–mediated axis may represent a
realistic approach for gastric cancer prevention.
