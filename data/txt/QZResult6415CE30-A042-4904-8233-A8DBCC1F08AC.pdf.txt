Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Clinical assessment of the response to antiangiogenic therapy has been cumbersome. A study in this
issue of Cancer Cell demonstrates that a combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for
quantification of normalized vessels with measurements of circulating levels of proangiogenic
factors, including FGF2, SDF1, and viable circulating endothelial cells, provides an effective means
to evaluate the response of recurrent glioblastoma to a prototypical pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitor, AZD2171.
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most frequent malignant brain tumors in adults and has a
poor response to chemotherapy and radiation. Treatment of newly diagnosed GBMs with
conventional chemotherapeutic agents, such as temozolomide and radiation, results in partial
response and a median survival of 12–14 months. Moreover, conventional therapy of recurrent
GBM is associated with poor outcomes, with less than 10% of patients having progressionfree survival at 6 months. Recently, it has been shown that coexpression of a constitutively
active variant of EGFR, EGFRvIII, and PTEN confers sensitivity of GBM to EGFR tyrosinekinase inhibitors (Mellinghoff et al., 2005). Methylation of the 06-methylguanine-DNA
transferase gene promoter also has been shown to correlate with favorable treatment response
to temozolomide (Hegi et al., 2005). However, despite all of these interventions, all GBM
patients relapse and succumb to tumor progression.

GBMs are known to be driven by hypoxia and VEGF-A overexpression. Moreover, the
vasculature of GBMs is atypical, disorganized, and leaky, resulting in the generation of
vasogenic brain edema. Therefore, defining the mechanism by which antiangiogenic
intervention may target GBM vasculature will not only optimize strategies to block growth of
this tumor but also diminish the neurological complications associated with brain edema.
Clinical trials have been designed to evaluate the role of antiangiogenic agents in the treatment
of GBMs, but the application of antiangiogenesis therapy to GBM has been cautious and slow
for fear of intracranial hemorrhage.
Using elegant imaging and molecular approaches, Rakesh Jain and colleagues have
demonstrated that antiangiogenic agents through selective pruning and maturation of unstable
vessels promote the emergence of “normalized,” pericyte-coated smaller vasculatures that are
efficient conduits for delivering chemotherapeutic agents and oxygen (Jain, 2005). These
findings have rekindled the hope that judicious introduction of antiangiogenic agents may
circumvent fatal hemorrhagic complications.

In this issue of Cancer Cell, Batchelor et al. provide evidence for normalization of GBM blood
vessels in patients treated with a pan-VEGF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, AZD2171, in
a phase 2 study (Batchelor et al., 2007). The rationale for using AZD2171 was based partially
on results showing a decrease in perfusion and vessel density in an in vivo breast cancer model
(Miller et al., 2006). Furthermore, using an orthotopic glioma model, Jain and colleagues had
previously identified the optimal window of time to deliver anti-VEGFR2 antibody to achieve
a synergistic effect with radiation (Winkler et al., 2004). During the window of normalization,
there was improved oxygenation, increased pericyte coverage, and upregulation of
angiopoietin-1 leading to a decrease in interstitial pressure and permeability within the tumor
(Winkler et al., 2004). In the present study, the window of normalization was quantified using
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from day 1 to 112 of AZD2171 administration. The authors
used MRI gradient echo, spin echo, and contrast enhancement to measure blood volume,
relative vessel size, and vascular permeability and concluded that AZD2171 was more effective
in pruning large size than small microvessels. Furthermore, using defined magnetic imaging
parameters ktrans and extracellular-extravascular volume fraction the authors demonstrated that
sculpting of the large and leaky vessels was associated with decreased vascular permeability,
which persisted much longer than the changes in relative vessel size. These data are in
agreement with reduced vasogenic brain edema as detected by MRI in patients with malignant
brain tumors treated with bevacizumab, a neutralizing antibody to VEGF-A, together with
chemotherapy (Pope et al., 2006). Reduction of vasogenic brain edema during AZD2171
treatment allowed elimination or reduction of corticosteroids, the chronic use of which is
responsible for serious neurological and medical morbidity.

As the MRI measurements of vascular size were done empirically, this study raises several
questions. (1) Are small vessels more “normalized” than the large vessels or vice versa? (2)
Are the large or small vessels differentially pruned and eliminated during antiangiogenic
therapy? (3) Does increased vessel size over time indeed correlate with the magnitude of
enhanced tumor vessel permeability? Despite using the most sophisticated MRI technology,
there are several factors that limit precise assessment of truly normalized vessels. First, the
determination of a “normalization window” by this group has heretofore been made in
xenograft models using direct measurements of vessel size, density, and permeability by
intravital microscopy (Winkler et al., 2004). In the current paper, the evaluation of glioma
vessel normalization relied upon the evaluation of relative vessel size and permeability using
MRI, as serial biopsy could not be performed on these patients. Second, MRI determination
of vessel size has previously been performed only in animal tumor models using optimal
contrast agents and has not been validated in human tumors, and is thus subject to a number
of confounding factors (Dennie et al., 1998). For example, use of Gd-DPTA, a relatively smallmolecule contrast agent, in this study necessarily relies on “first pass” dynamic measurements
of magnetic susceptibility, which would be subject to the leakage of this agent across the bloodtumor barrier and would threaten the accuracy of perfusion estimations, which depend on
compartmentalization of the contrast within the vessels (Dennie et al., 1998; Pathak et al.,
2001). Vessel size determinations in animal tumors typically have been done with largercontrast molecules, like MION, which can equilibrate in the blood but are yet to be approved
for human use (Dennie et al., 1998; Pathak et al., 2001). Other factors degrading the accuracy
of vessel size determination might include vessel tortuosity and disturbances as well as regional
variations in brain tumor blood flow (Cha, 2003). Obviously, if vessel size and permeability
measurements can be validated and standardized, perhaps with larger-molecular-weight
contrast agents, these measurements might become reliable surrogate markers for assessing
the response of gliomas to antiangiogenic agents.
Given the limitations enumerated above, the authors took advantage of other surrogate
biomarkers of neoangiogenesis, including plasma levels of FGF2, SDF1, and viable circulating
endothelial cells (CECs) (Jin et al., 2006; Rafii and Lyden, 2003). The authors showed that

progression on treatment with AZD2171 was associated with an increase in CECs, SDF1, and
FGF2, while progression after drug interruptions correlated with increases in circulating
progenitor cells (CPCs) and plasma FGF2 levels (Figure 1). The increase in plasma levels of
SDF1 and FGF2 correlated with the MRI measurements, demonstrating an increase in the
relative vessel density and size. Thus, MRI determination of vessel normalization in
combination with circulating biomarkers provides for an effective means to assess response to
antiangiogenic agents. This pioneering work set the stage for a screening platform for
evaluating antiangiogenic agents for the treatment of GBMs.

One other issue that requires further experimentation is that AZD2171 blocks not only VEGFR
tyrosine kinase activity in tumor blood vessels but also other tyrosine kinases, including c-Kit,
PDGFRα, and PDGFRβ, that are often expressed on the brain tumor cells (Wedge et al.,
2005). Therefore, it remains to be determined whether the normalization of the vessels is a
direct effect of AZD2171 on endothelial cells and/or an indirect effect on other tyrosine kinases
expressed on the tumor cells. Understanding the molecular target of AZD2171 may be critical
for diminishing the end-organ toxicity of AZD2171 if this agent will ultimately be used in
combination with radiotherapy or chemotherapeutic agents to determine whether there is an
impact on survival of patients with GBM. Indeed, in order to capitalize on the therapeutic
opportunity afforded by a “normalization” window in GBM patients, the addition of
chemotherapeutics or radiation will be essential. However, it is encouraging that preliminary
analyses indicated an improvement in progression-free survival and overall survival of this
group of 16 patients compared to historical controls.
Lastly, one paradox of antiangiogenic therapy leading to vessel normalization is the fact that
current antiangiogenic agents, such as AZD2171, seem to eradicate primarily unstable tumor
vessels, while selecting for maintenance of stabilized vessels that are believed to efficiently
deliver oxygen, nutrients, and chemotherapeutic agents to the tumors. However, delivery of
chemotherapeutic agents that are ineffective in treating recurrent GBM or other chemoresistant
solid tumors through normalized vessels is unlikely to result in a cure or durable remission;
thus, targeting stable tumor vessels may also be necessary. As such, development of effective
cytotoxic therapies and/or novel antiangiogenic approaches to target both unstable and
normalized tumor vessels to completely deprive the tumor mass of a blood supply is urgently
needed to achieve the ultimate goals envisioned for “antiangiogenesis” therapy.

Figure 1. Assessment of Response to Antiangiogenic Therapy with AZD2171 by Utilizing MRI and
Biomarkers

ZD2171 targets immature vessels, while favoring the emergence of normalized pericyte coated
blood vessels. Recurrence of the tumor is associated with generation of dilated, large, and leaky
blood vessels as well as plasma elevation of proangiogenic factors, including FGF2, SDF1,
and CECs. Normalization of the blood vessels is associated with a decrease in post-contrast
T1-weighted MRI signal (T1), T2-weighted (flair, T2), permeability (Ktrans), and recovery of
white matter integrity as detected by white matter tractography (WM). The MRI photographs
were adapted from Batchelor et al. (2007).
