BACKGROUND: Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) is a very aggressive thyroid gland malignancy with very poor prognosis. It is
suspected that the Notch signaling pathway, which is not active in ATC, may have a tumor suppressor function in this neoplasm.
However, it remains unknown whether activation of Notch can yield therapeutic efficacies in ATC. METHODS: The purpose of this
study was to evaluate the effect of chrysin, a potential Notch inducer identified via high-throughput screening, on ATC both in vitro
and in vivo. RESULTS: Chrysin treatment of ATC cells led to a dose-dependent inhibition of cellular growth. Protein and messenger
RNA levels of Notch1 and Hes1 (hairy/enhancer of split 1), a downstream Notch1 effector, were both up-regulated with treatment.
Luciferase reporter assays incorporating the C promoter-binding factor 1 (CBF1) binding site also confirmed the functional activity of
chrysin-induced Notch1. Oral administration of chrysin suppressed the growth of ATC xenografts by an average of 59% compared
with the vehicle control group (P ¼ .002). In addition, calculated median time to tumor progression was 11 days for control mice and
21 days for the chrysin treatment group (P ¼ .008). Analysis of chrysin-treated ATC tumors revealed an increase in the active intracellular domain of Notch1 protein. Activation of Notch1 in vivo was associated with the induction of cleaved Poly ADP ribose polymerase
(PARP) protein, indicating that the growth inhibition was due to apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The novel Notch1 activator chrysin inhibits tumor growth in ATC both in vitro and in vivo. Chrysin could be a promising therapeutic candidate for ATC, and this justifies furC 2012 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
The Notch1 signaling pathway is highly conserved and has a very important role in regulating cell proliferation, cell death,
and acquisition of specific cell fate.1 Notch1 signaling is activated by proteolytic cleavages of the Notch1 receptor, which
enable the release of the Notch1 intracellular domain (NICD), allowing it to translocate into the nucleus and cause downstream transcriptional activation.2,3 The aberrant gain or loss of Notch1 signaling components has been linked to multiple
human disorders, including cancer. Although Notch1 was first found as a proto-oncogene of T cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia,4 growing evidence supported by recent studies shows that Notch1 signaling can also have a potent tumor suppressor function in both hematological malignancies and solid tumors.5 In our previous studies, it also has been found
that activation of the Notch1 signaling inhibits growth of medullary thyroid carcinoma as well as well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas.6-8
Among all types of thyroid carcinomas, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is characterized by the most aggressive growth
features, which cause extensive local invasion and frequent distant metastasis. Although ATC makes up less than 2% of all
thyroid cancer cases, it represents more than half of thyroid cancer–related deaths.9 Unlike its differentiated counterparts,
prognosis of ATC is extremely poor with a median overall survival of less than 6 months.10 Currently, there is no standardized therapeutic regimen for patients with ATC, which necessitates the development of new treatment modalities.
Recently, it has been reported that Notch1 expression levels in ATC are significantly lower when compared with
that of normal thyroid tissues. Furthermore, overexpression of Notch1 in thyroid cancer cells suppresses cell growth rates
by reducing cell proliferation by 30%.11 These findings provide a promising new direction for treating ATC patients by
activation of Notch1 signaling. We previously identified 27 potential Notch-activating compounds out of more than
7000 tested through use of a high-throughput screening method.12 Chrysin was found to be one of the most potent Notch
activators among the positive hits. Chrysin is a naturally occurring compound found in honey and has been found to
induce apoptosis in different malignancies, including ATC.13-16 However, the associated regulatory pathways are underexplored, and little is known about the in vivo drug effects of chrysin in ATC. In this study, we evaluated whether chrysin
can act as a Notch1 signaling activator in ATC and determined its drug effects through both in vitro and in vivo studies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell Culture

Two ATC cell lines, namely HTh7 (a kind gift from Dr.
Rebecca Schweppe, University of Colorado, Denver,
Colo) and KAT18, were used for the in vitro studies. Both
of the cell lines are derived from human ATC and have
been confirmed with their unique identity by DNA
profiling.17 The cell lines were maintained in standard
Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, Calif) with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo). In
addition, medium for the KAT18 cells was supplemented
with 1% nonessential amino acids and 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Invitrogen) as described.16 The cells were grown
at 37 C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.
Chrysin (MP Biomedicals, Solon, Ohio) was dissolved in
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Sigma-Aldrich) at a stock
concentration of 100 mM, and fresh dilutions were made
for each treatment.
Cell Proliferation Assay

ATC cell proliferation was measured using the 3-[4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay. HTh7 and KAT18 cells were plated in
quadruplicate on 24-well plates at a density of 20,000 cells
per well and 15,000 cells per well, respectively. After incubation overnight to allow cell attachment, treatment medium with different concentrations of chrysin was added
and then changed every 2 days for up to 6 days. Cell proliferation was measured on the day of cell attachment
without treatment, as well as 2, 4, and 6 days after treatment. On the day of measurement, medium was removed
before cells were incubated at standard conditions in 250
lL of serum-free RPMI 1640 containing 0.5 mg/mL
MTT for 4 hours. To dissolve the MTT formazan, 750
lL of DMSO was added to each well and mixed thoroughly. Absorbance was measured at 540 nm wavelength
using a spectrophotometer (lQuant; Bio-Tek Instruments, Winooski, Vt).
Luciferase Reporter Assay

To determine the functional activity of Notch signaling,
ATC cells were transiently transfected with luciferase constructs as described.7 Cells were plated onto 6-well plates
in triplicate. The next day, the cells were cotransfected
with wild-type C-promoter binding factor 1 (CBF1) luciferase reporter plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. Diane
Hayward, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Md) and
cytomegalovirus b-galactosidase (CMV-b-gal; 0.5 lg),
through use of Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent
(Invitrogen). Twenty hours after transfection, cells were

treated with different concentrations of chrysin and incubated for another 48 hours. Luciferase and b-galactosidase
assays (Promega, Madison, Wis) were performed in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. In brief,
after cells were harvested and lysed, luciferase levels and bgalactosidase units were measured by a Monolight 2010
Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory, San
Diego, Calif) and a spectrophotometer at 420 nm wavelength (lQuant; Bio-Tek Instruments), respectively. Luciferase activity was normalized to b-galactosidase units
and expressed as relative light units.
Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction

Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells 2 days after
chrysin treatment, using an RNeasy Plus Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Of the total RNA isolated, 2 lg was
reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA using the
iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif). Sequences for each pair of polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) primers were as follows: Notch1 (forward
50 -GTCAACGCCGTAGATGACCT-30 and reverse 50 TTGTTAGCCCCGTTCTTCAG-30 ); Hes1 (hairy/
enhancer of split 1;forward 50 -TTGGAGGCTTCCAGGTGGTA-30 and reverse 50 -GGCCCCGTTG
GGAATG-30 ); GAPDH (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase; forward 50 -ACCTGCCAAATATGATGAC-30 and reverse 50 -ACCTGGTGCTCAGTGTAG30 ). The quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on a MyiQ Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories). All reactions were performed in triplicate. Target
gene expression was normalized to GAPDH levels in respective samples as an internal standard, and the comparative cycle threshold (DCt) method was used to calculate
relative expression levels of target genes.
Subcutaneous Xenograft Tumor Model and
Chrysin Administration

Animal studies were performed in compliance with our
animal experiment protocol approved by the University
of Wisconsin Madison Animal Care and Use Committee.
HTh7 cells (3  106 cells per 200 lL for each mouse) in
Hank’s balanced salt solution (Mediatech, Manassas, Va)
were injected subcutaneously into the right flank of 6week-old male nude mice (Charles River, Wilmington,
Mass). Mice with palpable tumors were randomly divided
into 2 groups for equal tumor size distribution. Animals
were treated every day for 21 days with either chrysin (75
mg/kg) or control DMSO administered by oral gavage.
Fresh dilutions of chrysin were made with DMSO and
olive oil before each treatment. The mice were weighed

every 4 days during the study period. The volume of the
xenograft tumor was measured every other day using digital calipers and calculated according to the following formula: tumor volume ¼ length  (width)2  p/6. The
relative tumor volume was defined as the fold change of
tumor volume for each time point compared to the initial
volume when treatment started. The xenograft tumors
were removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after the animals were sacrificed.
Western Blot Analysis

Total protein lysates from ATC cells and tumor xenografts were isolated as described.18 ATC cells were treated
with different concentrations of chrysin for 2 days before
protein isolation. Protein concentration was quantified
using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, Mass) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Denatured tissue extracts were resolved by 7.5% or
10% sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The
membranes were blocked and incubated with appropriate
primary antibodies overnight at 4 C. Primary antibodies
were diluted as follows: 1:1000 for Notch1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, Calif); 1:1000 for Hes1
(Abcam, Cambridge, Mass); 1:2000 for b-actin; 1:3000
for cleaved PARP (Poly ADP ribose polymerase) (Cell
Signaling Technology, Beverly, Mass). After washing,
membranes were incubated for 1.5 hours at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit/
mouse secondary antibodies. The immunoreactive bands
were detected by Immunstar (Bio-Rad Laboratories),
SuperSignal West Pico, or SuperSignal West Femto
(Pierce Biotechnology, Rockford, Ill) reagents.
Statistical Analysis

The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for
Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 17.0; SPSS,
Chicago, Ill). Unless specifically noted, continuous data
were presented as mean  standard error of the mean.
Student t test (2-sided) and one-way analysis of variance
(One-way ANOVA) were used to evaluate differences
between 2 groups and among multiple groups, respectively. Tumor progression was defined as increase of tumor volume equal to or more than 4-fold.19 The
progression-free status was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
method. Tests of survival equality were performed by the
log-rank test. P < .05 was considered statistically
significant.

RESULTS
Chrysin Inhibited Cell Growth In Vitro

To determine the growth inhibitory effect of chrysin on
ATC cells in vitro, MTT assays were carried out to measure cell viability 2, 4, and 6 days after chrysin treatment
of different concentrations up to 75 lM. Chrysin inhibited HTh7 (Fig. 1A) and KAT18 (Fig. 1B) cell growth in
a dose- and time-dependent manner.
Compared with the control group, 2-day chrysin
treatment of 25 lM resulted in a 6% reduction of cell
growth in the HTh7 cell line and suppressed cell growth
by 24% in KAT18 cells. Chrysin concentrations of 25
and 50 lM suppressed HTh7 cell growth by 34% and
73%, respectively, 6 days after treatment. An approximately 50% cell reduction was observed in both HTh7
and KAT18 cells 2 days after the treatment of 75 lM
chrysin, which suggests that a dose of 75 lM exceeds the
median inhibitory concentration (IC50). Therefore, 75
lM of chrysin was not tested in the later experiments due
to its toxicity to the cells. Similar growth inhibitory effects

of chrysin were seen in KAT18 cells for the 6-day treatment (Fig. 1B).
Notch1 Pathway Was Activated by Chrysin
Treatment In Vitro

To determine whether chrysin triggers the Notch signaling cascade in an ATC context, a luciferase reporter assay
incorporating the CBF1 binding site was carried out.
CBF1 is the best characterized downstream effector of
Notch in mammals, which, upon binding with active
Notch receptors, allows generation of a transcriptional activator complex.20,21 Chrysin treatment of 25 and 50 lM
significantly induced luciferase activity in HTh7 and
KAT18 cells, whereas cells without chrysin treatment
showed minimal to low luciferase activity (P < .05, Fig.
2A). The increased level of luciferase expression indicates
the functional activation of the Notch pathway.
The protein levels of NICD, an active form of
Notch1, were then measured to confirm our findings.
Both HTh7 and KAT18 cells revealed an obvious induction of NICD 48 hours after chrysin treatment. Hes1, a
Notch1 downstream target, was also increased with the
treatment, as demonstrated by western blot (Fig. 2B). In
addition, as shown by real-time PCR, chrysin treatment
led to increased expression of Notch1 messenger RNA
(mRNA) levels in both ATC cell lines in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2C) as well as in mRNA levels of Hes1
(Fig. 2D). This evidence suggests that Notch1 signaling is
activated by chrysin via transcriptional regulation.

of the treatment course, there were 5 animals (50%) with
tumor progression in the chrysin-treated group, whereas
all of the animals in the vehicle control group displayed
tumor progression (Fig. 4). No tumor regression was
observed in either group. The calculated median time to
progression was 11 days for control mice and 21 days for
the chrysin treatment group (P ¼ .008).
Active Notch1 Up-Regulated by Chrysin Was
Associated With Apoptosis in ATC Tumor
Xenografts

Chrysin Suppressed ATC Tumor Growth In Vivo

To assess whether chrysin activates Notch1 signaling in an
ATC xenograft model, tumor samples from both groups
were first examined for expression levels of NICD protein.
NICD is the activated Notch1 intracellular domain,
which translocates to the nucleus and triggers downstream
transcriptional activities. All the samples from the
chrysin-treated group showed moderate to strong expression of NICD, whereas most of the samples from the control group revealed no or minimal expression. NICD
profoundly increased in the treatment group, suggesting
that chrysin acts as a Notch1 activator in vivo. To further
investigate the possible mechanism of growth inhibition
in vivo by chrysin, we examined the levels of cleavedPARP, a product of apoptosis. Elevated expression of
cleaved-PARP was found in the tumor tissue of chrysintreated mice compared with those in the control group
(Fig. 5). In addition, cleaved-PARP was concomitantly
increased with NICD expression in most of the samples,
indicating that apoptosis induced by chrysin was associated with Notch1 activation.

Next, we evaluated the impact of chrysin on an ATC xenograft model. Nude mice bearing subcutaneous HTh7
cell xenografts were treated with either chrysin (n ¼ 10,
75 mg/kg/day) or DMSO as a vehicle control (n ¼ 8).
None of the mice in the group with chrysin treatment
exhibited any weight loss or overt toxicity compared with
the controls. All animals survived until the endpoint of
the study. The growth of ATC xenografts was progressively suppressed in the chrysin treatment group (Fig. 3).
The tumor volume increased an average of 11-fold in the
vehicle control group 21 days after DMSO treatment.
Meanwhile, only a 4.4-fold induction of tumor growth
was observed in chrysin-treated animals on average.
Chrysin suppressed the growth of ATC xenografts by an
average of 59% compared with the control group.
As stated in the Materials and Methods section, an
equal to or more than 4-fold increase in tumor volume
was defined as tumor progression. Animals treated with
chrysin had smaller average tumor volumes than the control group but still showed cancer progression. By the end

DISCUSSION
The prognosis for ATC patients is extremely poor with no
current standard treatment modality. Recently, the
Notch1 pathway, which affects cell proliferation and survival, has been found to be down-regulated in ATC.11
However, little is known about therapeutic efficacies on
the activation of Notch1 signaling in ATC. In this study,
we evaluated the antitumor effects of chrysin, a potential
Notch inducer, both in vitro and in vivo. Our data
showed that chrysin inhibited cell growth and activated
the Notch1 signaling pathway in ATC cells. More importantly, chrysin treatment resulted in a more than 50%
tumoristatic response in vivo. In addition, the tumor xenografts from chrysin-treated mice revealed a higher expression of an apoptotic marker concomitant with Notch1
signaling activation.
Chrysin, a natural flavonoid, has emerged as an anticancer agent for different malignancies, including non–
small cell lung cancer, leukemia, and prostate

59% in this study. Chrysin prevented tumor progression
in half of the animals, which suggests that the antiproliferative effects of chrysin can also be achieved for cancers in
vivo. Meanwhile, it remains important to improve the bioavailability of the drug either by more effective delivery
or by combination with other drugs for a synergistic
effect.
In addition, chrysin was found to activate Notch1
pathway both in vitro and in vivo. The role of Notch1 has
been reported as a tumor suppressor in recent studies.
Notch1 loss-of-function results in spontaneous basal cell
carcinoma,24 and inhibition of Notch1 signaling accelerates the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.25 For
the epithelial thyroid cancers, including well-differentiated and anaplastic thyroid cancers, much lower expression of Notch1was detected in tumors compared with
that of normal thyroid tissues. In our study, both of the
ATC cell lines used had very minimal expression of active
Notch1, which accurately modeled the molecular features
of ATC sampled from patients. Although KAT18 cells
had a higher proportion of endogenous Notch1 mRNA
than did HTh7 cells, the basal protein level of NICD
turned out to be very low. This finding is consistent with
the lower mRNA and protein levels of Hes1 that were
observed, suggesting that Notch1 signaling is not
adequately active in HTh7 or in KAT18 cells. A significant induction of Notch1 mRNA levels as well as NICD
protein levels was observed with chrysin treatment in vitro

and in vivo. In addition, chrysin treatments up-regulated
the downstream targets of Notch1 signaling as evidenced
by increased luciferase activity of CBF1 and expression
levels of Hes1. These findings indicate that chrysin not
only transcriptionally regulates Notch1 gene expression,
but induces functional Notch1 protein, which is able to
trigger the signaling cascade. It has been shown that overexpression of active Notch1 using DNA plasmids in either
well-differentiated thyroid cancer or ATC cell causes significant growth inhibition.7,11 Therefore, it is not surprising to see the inhibitory effect on ATC by chrysin, which
could be largely due to Notch1 pathway activation.
Notch1 plays a critical role in many fundamental
processes including apoptosis, a programmed cell death of
which most cancer cells have lost normal regulation.
Notch1 regulates apoptosis through extensive networks,
involving cell cycle, growth, and survival pathways. As a
tumor suppressor, Notch signaling has been reported to
suppress growth and induce apoptosis in B cell malignancies.26 In our previous studies, it was common to see
Notch1 activation by the drug treatment induce apoptosis.16,27 Several studies have reported various mechanisms
regarding how Notch1 is involved in apoptotic processes,
which may occur through either direct interaction with
members of the IAP family or via indirect crosstalk with
other signaling pathways such as the p53 pathway.28,29 In
this study, we demonstrated by an in vivo model that the
protein level of cleaved-PARP was increased along with
NICD expression in most of the samples from chrysintreated mice, indicating that apoptosis induced by this
compound was highly associated with Notch1 activation.
In a recent study, PARP1 has been identified as a novel target of Notch1 signaling to induce apoptosis. Mediated by
Hes1, Notch1 interacts with PARP1 in a cell type–specific
manner which allows translocation of apoptosis-inducing
factor from the mitochondria to the nucleus.30 In this
study, chrysin activated Notch1 signaling and increased
Hes1 expression. It was also seen to enhance the cleavage
of PARP. These data imply that chrysin could induce apoptosis in ATC through Notch1 and PARP by modulating
the function of the Hes1 transcriptional complex.
In conclusion, chrysin inhibits tumor growth in
ATC both in vitro and in vivo, which could be mainly
due to apoptosis associated with Notch1 signaling activation. These findings suggest that activation of Notch1 signaling is worthy of extensive evaluation as a treatment
option for ATC patients. In addition, novel Notch1
inducers like chrysin are promising therapeutic candidates, which justifies further preclinical and clinical
studies.
