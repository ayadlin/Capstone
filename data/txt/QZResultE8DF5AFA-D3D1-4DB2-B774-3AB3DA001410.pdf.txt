Abstract

Author Manuscript

The ATP-dependent DExH/D-box helicase DHX9 is a key participant in a number of gene
regulatory steps, including transcriptional, translational, microRNA-mediated control, DNA
replication, and maintenance of genomic stability. DHX9 has also been implicated in tumor cell
maintenance and drug response. Here, we report that inhibition of DHX9 expression is lethal to
human cancer cell lines and murine Eµ−Myc lymphomas. Using a novel conditional shDHX9
mouse model, we demonstrate that sustained and prolonged (6 months) suppression of DHX9 does
not result in any deleterious effects at the organismal level. Body weight, blood biochemistry, and
histology of various tissues were comparable to control mice. Global gene expression profiling
revealed that although reduction of DHX9 expression resulted in multiple transcriptome changes,
these were relatively benign and did not lead to any discernible phenotype. Our results
demonstrate a robust tolerance for systemic DHX9 suppression in vivo and support the targeting of
DHX9 as an effective and specific chemotherapeutic approach.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

DHX9 (also known as Nuclear DNA Helicase II (NDH II) and RNA helicase A (RHA)) is
an ATP-dependent DExH/D-box helicase capable of unwinding both RNA and DNA1, as
well as aberrant polynucleotide structures2. Initially purified from bovine thymus3,
homologs have been subsequently identified in human, mouse, Drosophila, and C.
elegans4–6. DHX9 is comprised of two RNA-binding domains at the N-terminus, a core
helicase region consisting of seven conserved motifs, and a DNA-binding domain and
nuclear localization signal at the C-terminus7. The presence of numerous functional domains
likely contributes to the multifunctional nature of DHX9, which has been implicated in a
variety of biological processes. It participates at multiple levels of gene regulation, including
transcriptional regulation via interaction with a number of transcription factors and
complexes (e.g. CREB-binding protein, EGFR, BRCA1, NF-κB, and RNA polymerase
II)8–11, translational regulation of specific mRNAs12, 13, miRNA processing14, and RNA
transport15. DHX9 is also an important factor in DNA repair16 and maintenance of genome
stability2, 17, 18.

Author Manuscript

We previously uncovered DHX9 as a synthetic lethal hit from an shRNA screen for
modifiers of sensitivity to ABT-737 (an inhibitor of BCL-2 family pro-survival factors)19.
Suppression of DHX9 acted in concert with MYC to sensitize lymphoma cells
overexpressing BCL-2 to ABT-737. Subsequent examination of the effects of DHX9
suppression in primary human diploid, non-transformed fibroblasts revealed a pronounced
growth arrest and premature senescence phenotype, but not cell death20. This was attributed
to inhibition of DNA replication which activated a p53-dependent stress response to protect
cells from aberrant DNA replication and genomic instability20. Hence, DHX9 appears to
play an important role in DNA replication and normal cell cycle progression.
Although we initially discovered that inhibiting DHX9 had therapeutic properties in
combination with ABT-737 in lymphomas overexpressing BCL-2, we also noted that longterm suppression of DHX9 in tumors with reduced BCL-2 overexpression was lethal on its
own [see Suppl. Figs. 10 and 13 in Ref. 19]. In this study, we explore the possibility of
DHX9 as a potential single-agent anti-neoplastic target and assess whether its suppression at
the organismal level would be tolerated through the use of an inducible RNAi platform
enabling DHX9 suppression in vivo in the mouse21, 22. Despite having detrimental effects on
cellular fitness of tumor cells ex vivo and in vivo, we observed no adverse consequences
resulting from reduced DHX9 expression at the organismal level. Our results support the
notion of inhibiting DHX9 as a potential chemotherapeutic target with tolerable side effects.

RESULTS
DHX9 suppression reduces human cancer cell fitness
Whereas short-term suppression of DHX9 is synthetic lethal in combination with ABT-737
in Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 lymphomas, we previously noted that DHX9 suppression is not well
tolerated if BCL-2 is not supra-elevated19. To further document this latter effect on
transformed cells, we suppressed DHX9 in different human tumor cell lines as well as in the
non-immortalized MRC-5 line (Figure 1a). Initially, a representative panel of cell lines

derived from different types of cancer was tested, including multiple myeloma (KMS-11,
JJN-3, and IM-9), osteosarcoma (U2OS), breast (MCF-7 and MDA-MB231), lung (A549),
and cervical (Hela) cancers. Infected cells (GFP+) were co-cultured with non-infected cells
(GFP−) and the %GFP+ cells determined at t=0 and 10 days (Figure 1b). Suppression of
DHX9 in all cell lines except MCF-7 led to a decrease in the GFP+ population over time
(Figure 1b). To understand the molecular basis of this depletion, we quantified the extent of
cell death that ensued following DHX9 suppression and found elevated apoptosis in all
tumor lines (Figure 1c; 1.4 to 3.7-fold increase), except MCF-7 and U2OS. As previously
reported20, MRC-5 cells did not show evidence of cell death but rather senesced (Figure 1c
and d). We carried out cell cycle analysis on the tumor cell lines at day 10 after transduction
with control or DHX9 shRNAs (Supplementary Figure 1). Upon DHX9 suppression, U2OS
cells exhibited a pronounced (~15%) increase in the cells in the G0/G1 phase, and a 7–9%
decrease in the number of cells in both the S and G2/M phases (Supplementary Figure 1).
This demonstrates that U2OS cells were arresting in the G0/G1 phase, and that this
correlated with depletion of shDHX9-expressing cells shown in Figure 1b. The IM-9 cells
also showed a small G0/G1 arrest (~5% increase in G0/G1 cells). The remaining cell lines
(KMS-11, JJN-3, MDA-MB231, A549, and Hela) did not show any significant changes in
cell cycle distribution upon DHX9 knockdown, suggesting that apoptosis was the main
mechanism of the depletion of shDHX9-expressing cells in these lines. The striking
difference in phenotype obtained upon DHX9 suppression in the majority of transformed
cells versus non-transformed cells prompted us to investigate DHX9 suppression as a
potential anti-neoplastic approach.

To gain insight into the possible mechanisms contributing to the differences in response to
DHX9 suppression among tumor cells, we compared the expression level of various cell
cycle and apoptotic proteins (Supplementary Figure 2). Of all the cell lines tested, only
U2OS and MRC-5 demonstrated a significant increase in CDKN1A levels, which may
explain why DHX9 suppression elicited a growth arrest response rather than an apoptotic
one. We observed a robust increase in p53 expression in JJN-3 and KMS-11 and a moderate
increase in U2OS and MRC-5 cells. MDA-MB231 exhibited high basal levels of p53 but no
upregulation upon DHX9 suppression, whereas Hela cells had almost non-existent p53
levels – these results are consistent with the former harboring mutated p53 (Ref. 23) and the
latter overexpressing the E6 protein from human papillomavirus type 16, which induces the
degradation of p53 (Ref. 24). While p53 activation may have contributed to the deleterious
effect of DHX9 suppression in some of the cancer lines, it is not the only determinant, since
both MDA-MB231 and Hela cells were susceptible to DHX9 inhibition. c-MYC expression
was relatively high in A549 and Hela cells. Expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins MCL-1
and BCL-2 was highest in KMS-11, JJN-3 and MCF-7 cells. All cell lines expressed similar
levels of the pro-apoptotic protein BAX, except for MCF-7, which expressed lower levels.
Expression of Bim, another pro-apoptotic protein, was elevated in the three multiple
myeloma lines compared to the other cancer lines. High levels of MCL-1 and BCL-2,
combined with low levels of BAX and Bim, may have contributed to the resistance of
MCF-7 cells to DHX9 suppression. These results indicate that the response of this set of cell
lines to DHX9 suppression is not easily attributed to a single cell cycle or apoptotic
modulator.

Given that all three multiple myeloma-derived lines showed robust depletion of GFP+ cells
upon loss of DHX9 in the competition assay (Figure 1b), we were interested in extending
these results. To this end, we assessed the effect of DHX9 suppression in 5 additional
multiple myeloma lines: RPMI8226, U266B1, H929, OPM1.1, and OPM2. Of these,
RPMI8226, H929, and OPM1.1 showed GFP depletion upon DHX9 knockdown in a
competition assay (Supplementary Figure 3b). In total, 6 out of 8 multiple myeloma cell
lines exhibited sensitivity to DHX9 suppression (Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure 3b).
We also examined whether DHX9 would synergize with dexamethasone, a glucocorticoid
(GC) used to treat multiple myeloma. Here we tested KMS-11 cells which are responsive to
GC (IC50 = 50 nM following a 48 h exposure)25, JJN-3 cells which are resistant to GC with
the defect occurring downstream of the GC receptor (IC50 >> 3 µM following a 48 h
exposure)25, and IM-9 cells – a GC-resistant lymphoblastoid cell line. Loss of DHX9 was
found to sensitize KMS-11 cells to dexamethasone by ~ 1.4–1.5 fold and JJN-3 cells by ~1.7
fold, but had little effect on IM-9 cells (Supplementary Figure 3c). These results indicate
that DHX9 suppression is not well tolerated by a number of tumor cells, with multiple
myeloma being a particularly susceptible cancer type.
Modeling DHX9 suppression in Eµ-Myc lymphomas

Author Manuscript

Given the above results, we sought to model the consequences of DHX9 knockdown in a
more tractable murine model. First, we recapitulated the results described above using
Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas, a Myc-driven tumor model26. Suppression of DHX9 in these
cells was not well tolerated, with significant depletion of GFP+ cells occurring within 2 days
post-infection using two independent DHX9 shRNAs (Figure 2a). This was comparable to
what was observed with cells expressing shrpL15.498, which suppresses expression of the
essential ribosomal protein, rpL15 (Ref. 27) (Figure 2a). Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas
infected with MLS/shRLuc.713, a neutral shRNA targeting Renilla luciferase, were
unaffected. A significant increase in apoptotic events was observed in DHX9 shRNAexpressing cells, compared to shRLuc.713-expressing cells, and was associated with
elevated p53 and CDKN1A levels (Figures 2b and 2c).

Author Manuscript

To determine whether the lethal effect of DHX9 could be recapitulated in vivo, shRNAexpressing Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas were introduced into C57BL/6 mice via tail-vein
injection. Injected mice showed an increase in the percentage of splenic B-cells (~75–85%)
compared to non-injected controls (45%), consistent with onset of lymphomagenesis (Figure
2d). Ten days later, spleens were harvested from the mice and the %GFP+ Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc
tumor cells determined (Figure 2e). Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc tumor cells expressing the neutral
shRLuc.713 control comprised the majority of the splenic cell population and showed a
similar GFP+/GFP− ratio as the initial injected cell population (Figure 2e). In contrast, mice
that had received Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc tumor cells expressing shDHX9.1241, shDHX9.1271, or
shL15.498 showed a profound (12–18 fold) depletion of GFP+ tumor cells 10 days following
injection, with the majority of tumor cells exhibiting a GFP− phenotype, likely representing
an outgrowth of non-infected tumor cells (~40–50%) arising from the initial population
(Figure 2e). Taken together, these results demonstrate that DHX9 suppression is lethal in
Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas ex vivo and in vivo.

To determine whether DHX9 suppression had an effect on survival of mice harboring
Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas, we took advantage of an shRNA doxycycline-inducible
expression system utilizing the TRMPV vector28 (Figure 3a). Here, constitutive expression
of Venus facilitates monitoring of infection efficiency whereas dsRed and miR30 expression
are dependent on doxycycline and co-expression of rtTA. Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc lymphomas
expressing rtTA were generated by crossing Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc mice with Rosa26-M2rtTA
mice and harvesting the resulting tumors from triple-transgenic progeny22. Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc/
R26-M2rtTA tumors were transduced with TRMPV retroviruses expressing RLuc, DHX9 or
L15 shRNAs. Ex vivo, addition of DOX resulted in robust induction of shRNA expression,
as assessed by the percentage of Venus and dsRed double positive cells (Figures 3b and c).
Conditional suppression of DHX9 resulted in a >6-fold increase in cell death (8 days postinduction) relative to shRLuc.713-infected controls (Figure 3d). Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc/R26M2rtTA lymphomas infected with TRMPV-shRNAs were then introduced into C57BL/6
mice via tail-vein injection with 50% of each cohort receiving doxycycline (DOX) 6 days
post-injection. Spleens harvested at terminal disease stage were enlarged, showed an
increased percentage of B-cells compared to non-injected controls (Figure 3f), and the
majority of splenic B-cells were both Venus and dsRed positive in the DOX-treated mice
(Figure 3g), demonstrating successful transplantation of the tumor cells and induction by
DOX. Untreated and DOX-treated mice harboring tumors expressing shRLuc.713 reached
terminal disease 9–10 days following tumor cell transplantation (Figure 3h). In contrast,
DOX-treated mice harboring tumors expressing shDHX9.1241 and shDHX9.1271 reached
terminal disease stage 12–14 days post-injection. Survival was extended to 13–20 days for
the shL15.498 +DOX mice (Figure 3h). These results are consistent with suppression of
DHX9 in vivo delaying lymphomagenesis and conferring a survival advantage.

Whereas intriguing, the aforementioned results do not address whether DHX9 suppression
would be tolerated at the organismal level. To this end, we took advantage of a previously
described FLP/FRT-mediated site-specific recombination approach to introduce DHX9
shRNAs into the mouse germline22 (Supplementary Figure 4a). As a prelude to these
studies, we tested several DHX9 shRNAs for suppression potency (Supplementary Table 1
and Supplementary Figure 4b). Several shRNAs (DHX9.1241, DHX9.1271 and DHX9.837)
showed potent DHX9 suppression and two of these (DHX9.1271 and DHX9.837) were
chosen for generating transgenic mice. Two mouse strains were generated, DHX9.837/rtTA
and DHX9.1271/rtTA, containing DHX9 shRNA expression under TRE regulation at the
Col1A1 locus and rtTA expression driven from the Rosa26 locus. Transgenic mice
expressing a neutral shRNA targeting Firefly luciferase (FLuc.1309/rtTA) were used as
controls22.
Examination of DHX9 expression in various tissues from FLuc.1309/rtTA, DHX9.837/rtTA,
and DHX9.1271/rtTA mice treated with either vehicle or 1 mg/ml DOX for 14 days revealed
suppression in all tissues examined, although the extent varied (Figure 4). The small
intestine, large intestine, and thymus exhibited potent knockdown of DHX9 in both shDHX9
strains. In the skin, liver and heart, knockdown was moderate and the spleen exhibited
weaker, mosaic suppression (Figure 4). Expression of DHX9 was predominantly nuclear

(Supplementary Figure 5), consistent with previous studies29. TurboGFP, as expected, was
DOX-inducible (Supplementary Figure 6). These results were confirmed by Western blot
analysis of DHX9 knockdown and turboGFP expression in the aforementioned tissues
(Supplementary Figure 7).

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown that DHX9 knockdown increases p53 protein levels and
activity in human fibroblasts, Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 lymphomas, and U2OS cells19, 20. To
determine whether these changes were recapitulated in our murine models, we examined
RB1, p53, and CDKN1A status following DHX9 suppression (Supplementary Figure 7). We
observed no consistent, robust induction of p53 in tissues from the two shDHX9 mouse
strains either by Western blotting (Supplementary Figure 7) or immunohistochemistry
(Supplementary Figure 8). There was also no consistent activation of the p53 target,
CDKN1A. RB1 was expressed at very low levels in the skin and liver, and was unchanged
upon DHX9 knockdown in all tissues analyzed (Supplementary Figure 7). These results
indicate that under the conditions analyzed, we find no evidence for robust activation of p53,
CDKN1A, or RB1 upon DHX9 suppression at the organismal level.

We next examined the consequences of DHX9 suppression to the general health and
physiology of adult mice. Mice (4 week old) were treated with DOX for 6 months. Efficient
long-term knockdown of DHX9 and induction of GFP was verified in various tissues (Figure
5). In this chronic DHX9-suppressed cohort, the weight, appearance, and behavior of
DHX9.837/rtTA and DHX9.1271/rtTA mice on DOX were similar to those of FLuc.1309/
rtTA (+DOX) and untreated mice (Figure 6a and b). We observed no evidence of weight
loss, lowered activity levels, lack of grooming, hunched appearance, dehydration, or
infections. Blood biochemical and hematological analyses of the treated cohorts revealed no
significant differences from FLuc.1309/rtTA (+DOX) or untreated controls (Supplementary
Tables 2 – 4), implying normal physiology and bone marrow function. Histopathological
analysis of tissues from mice treated with DOX for 6 months did not reveal any pathological
changes in the skin, small and large intestines, spleen, thymus, and heart specific to the
DHX9/rtTA cohort (Table 1 and Figure 6c) nor in the % of splenic B and T cells (Figure 6d).
In addition, Ki-67 and TUNEL staining was performed on the more proliferative tissues namely skin, spleen, and small and large intestines. DHX9 suppression had no deleterious
effects on proliferation in the skin and spleen, as determined by Ki-67 staining
(Supplementary Figure 9). A slight decrease in Ki-67-positive cells was observed in the
small and large intestines upon treatment with DOX, however this appeared to be due to the
DOX itself, as it was seen in the FLuc.1309/rtTA +DOX mice as well. There appeared to be
no significant difference between the FLuc.1309/rtTA and DHX9/rtTA DOX-treated samples
in these tissues (Supplementary Figure 9). TUNEL staining revealed no increase in apoptotic
cells upon DHX9 suppression in any of the tissues tested (Supplementary Figure 10).
Assessing DHX9 suppression on global gene expression
Having observed no apparent negative physiological effects of DHX9 suppression in mice,
we asked whether reduced DHX9 levels induced any changes in global gene expression in
vivo. To address this, we conducted gene expression analysis on the large intestine isolated

from FLuc.1309/rtTA, DHX9.837/rtTA and DHX9.1271/rtTA mice treated with DOX for 14
days. The large intestine was chosen because it was one of the tissues showing potent
suppression of DHX9, which was validated in samples isolated for global gene expression
studies (Figure 7a). A comparison of the expression patterns between DHX9/rtTA and FLuc.
1309/rtTA samples identified 451 transcripts as differentially expressed in at least one of the
DHX9/rtTA mice (fold-change>1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05; Figure 7b and
Supplementary Table 5). Although only 77 transcripts were significantly altered in both
shDHX9 transgenic samples, the fold-changes observed for the combined set of genes were
largely consistent for both DHX9 shRNAs (Figure 7c). Our previous transcriptome-wide
analysis of DHX9 suppression in cell lines showed activation of the p53 signaling pathway
in ex vivo contexts19, 20. This phenomenon was not observed in the large intestine of DOXtreated DHX9.837/rtTA and DHX9.1271/rtTA mice (Figure 7d). Moreover, there were only
minor changes in levels of p53 mRNA itself (1.2 or 1.4 fold for DHX9.837/rtTA and
DHX9.1271/rtTA, respectively) without concomitant changes in CDKN1A, consistent with
Western blot results (Supplementary Figure 7). Gene set enrichment analysis was applied to
identify functions that were enriched among genes showing differential expression. The
identified biological processes found to be most affected by DHX9 suppression were DNA
replication, translation, RNA splicing, non-coding RNA processes, and nuclear division
(Figure 7e and Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Taken together, these results indicate
significant transcriptome changes as a consequence of DHX9 suppression in the large
intestine, but these do not lead to any overt pathological perturbations.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

One of the major challenges in chemotherapy is finding a therapeutic window in which
drugs can efficiently eliminate tumor cells with minimal damage to normal tissues.
Traditional strategies rely on the administration of cytotoxic agents (e.g. paclitaxel,
etoposide, doxorubicin, etc.), which act by killing rapidly dividing cells, a property shared
by both cancer cells and highly proliferative normal cells. With the advent of targeted
molecular therapeutics, the development of drugs that inhibit specific gene products involved
in tumor maintenance offer greater selectivity in eliminating cancer cells. However, the
challenge of finding targets with suitable therapeutic indices remains, as targeting these
same gene products in normal tissues can have deleterious effects. Hence, the search for
novel molecular targets for chemotherapeutic use is a critical ongoing endeavor.

Author Manuscript

In the present study, we examined the outcome of DHX9 suppression in several human
cancer cell lines, mouse engineered lymphomas, and at the organismal level in the mouse.
DHX9 suppression resulted in a reduction in proliferative fitness in most (10 out of 13)
human cancer cell lines representing five different types of cancers. This demonstrates that
targeting DHX9 can be potentially effective against many, but not all, cancers. What makes a
cancer a good candidate may be dependent on the relative expression levels of genes
involved in proliferation, cell cycle progression, or apoptotic pathways. What makes MCF-7
breast cancer cells resistant to DHX9 suppression (Figure 1b) awaits further investigation
but may be due to the fact that these express high levels of the anti-apoptotic proteins BCL-2
and MCL-1, and low levels of pro-apoptotic proteins c-MYC, Bim, and Bax (Supplementary
Figure 2 and Ref. 30). Although the multiple myeloma lines JJN-3 and KMS-11 express

BCL-2, the fact that they also express the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim, Bax, and Bak at
relatively high levels (Supplementary Figure 2 and Ref. 31) may contribute to their inability
to tolerate DHX9 suppression. All cell lines tested herein (Figure 1) have been reported to
contain wildtype p53, with the exception of MDA-MB231 (Ref. 23). Hela cells contain
wildtype p53 but overexpress the E6 protein from human papillomavirus type 16, which
induces the degradation of p53 (Ref. 24). KMS-11 and JJN-3 exhibited the highest foldincrease in p53 levels, which may be a contributing factor to the robust depletion of DHX9
shRNA-expressing cells observed in the competition assay for these cell lines. However, the
level of p53 activation was not the only determinant of susceptibility to DHX9. Both MDAMB231 and Hela cells were sensitive to DHX9 suppression, despite harboring mutated p53
or low p53 levels, while MCF-7 cells, which contain wild-type p53, were resistant. Thus, it
is likely that susceptibility of a cancer cell line to DHX9 inhibition is not dependent on a
single factor, a topic that will require further investigation. Of the cancer cell lines which
showed GFP depletion upon DHX9 suppression in the competition assay (Figure 1b),
increased cell death was documented in all cell lines except the U2OS osteosarcoma line,
which underwent a G0/G1 arrest instead (Supplementary Figure 1). We note that only the
U2OS and MRC-5 cells demonstrated a significant increase in CDKN1A levels, an inhibitor
of proliferation. Activation of CDKN1A has been shown to lead to cell cycle arrest and
senescence rather than apoptosis32, 33. In fact, studies have shown that in some cases it may
actually inhibit apoptosis34 and may explain why loss of DHX9 does not result in increased
cell death in U2OS and MRC-5 cells but causes growth arrest and/or senescence19, 20, 35. In
all the other cell lines, which did not show CDKN1A induction, it appeared that apoptosis
rather than cell cycle arrest was primarily responsible for the decrease in proliferative fitness
observed upon DHX9 knockdown (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure 1). These results
illustrate that the precise effects of DHX9 suppression may depend on biological context.
The lethal effect observed in several human cancer lines with DHX9 suppression was
recapitulated in murine Eµ-Myc lymphomas ex vivo and in vivo.

Author Manuscript

Having demonstrated that DHX9 suppression is not tolerated by most tumor cells, we
investigated the consequences on normal tissues in vivo. To this end, we generated inducible
RNAi-based transgenic mice to study the consequences of DHX9 loss at the organismal
level. This inducible model allowed us to achieve conditional and reversible suppression of
DHX9, which would not have been possible using a straight knockout model. Indeed, Lee
and colleagues previously generated a DHX9 knockout mouse and observed that
homozygous loss leads to embryonic lethality36. Their results suggest that DHX9 is essential
for the differentiation of the embryonic ectoderm36. Consistent with this, the C. elegans
homologue, rha-1, is necessary for germline transcriptional control and proliferation37. In
this report, we find that partial suppression of DHX9 is well tolerated at the organismal level
in adult mice, a situation that reflects the scenario one would expect with a small molecule
inhibitor of DHX9. Indeed, chronic suppression of DHX9 in the mouse for 6 months had no
noticeable effect, indicating that the organism appears well buffered to tolerate profound
changes in DHX9 levels.
Although the mice appeared to suffer no ill effects resulting from DHX9 suppression,
analysis of global gene expression in the large intestine identified numerous genes whose
expression was affected upon DHX9 loss (Figure 7). Our enrichment analysis revealed that

genes involved in metabolism, DNA replication, translational initiation, mitotic nuclear
division, RNA splicing, amongst others, were upregulated. It should be noted this analysis
included genes which negatively regulate the aforementioned processes. An example is the
increased expression of eIF4EBP1, a translational inhibitor. However, eIF4G1, eIF2A, and
DHX29, all known to stimulate translation38, 39, were also upregulated (Supplementary
Tables 6 and 7); thus the net result on translation is difficult to predict. Similarly, genes
involved in mitotic nuclear division found to be upregulated included promoters of this
process (e.g. SMC2, CDK1, CDC20, CDC25C, and Plk1) as well as checkpoint proteins
(e.g. Mad2/1, CHEK1, CDC27) (Supplementary Tables 6 and 7). Hence, there may be little
net effect on cell cycle progression. Interestingly, there appeared to be no activation of a p53
transcriptional program upon DHX9 suppression, in contrast to previous genome-wide
expression studies in Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 lymphomas and MRC-5 human fibroblasts, where
p53 pathway activation elicited an apoptotic or senescence response respectively19, 20. On a
more general level, comparison of our present data with previous data generated in
Arf−/−Eµ-Myc/Bcl-2 and MRC-5 cells revealed no significant overlap with the previous
studies (data not shown). In MRC-5 cells, DHX9 suppression resulted in downregulation of
many genes involved in promoting DNA replication, mitosis, and cell cycle progression20.
This was not recapitulated in vivo. The fact that we did not observe activation of the p53
pathway or global downregulation of proliferative and replication genes at the organismal
level is consistent with the lack of detectable phenotype resulting from reduced DHX9
expression in mice. Conversely, the upregulation of many biological processes may represent
a compensatory response to the cellular perturbations caused by DHX9 suppression – a
mechanism that may occur in vivo but not ex vivo. In any event, the changes in global gene
expression were small compared to those sustained ex vivo, and appear to be relatively
benign, as they resulted in no drastic consequences in the mice.

While the two DHX9 shRNAs exhibited similar levels of knockdown ex vivo and in most
tissues in vivo (Figures 4, 5 and 7a, and Supplementary Figures 4b, 6, and 7),
histopathological analysis revealed that the DHX9.837/rtTA +DOX mice exhibited moderate
hepatic lipidosis, which was not found in the DHX9.1271/rtTA +DOX mice (Table 1).
Although we have not investigated the potential reasons for this additional phenotype, we do
not feel it can be explained by differences in knockdown potency (which appear quite
similar). We cannot rule out that it may represent a possible off-target effect of shDHX9.837
at this time.

Why loss of DHX9 has such detrimental effects on tumor cells but no negative impact on
normal adult tissues is not entirely clear, but this finding has been documented in a number
of previous settings with key regulatory proteins. DDX5 is a DEAD-box RNA helicase with
many similarities to DHX9. It is multifunctional, with important roles in transcriptional
regulation, microRNA processing, RNA splicing, and ribosome biogenesis40–43.
Furthermore, loss of DDX5 is embryonic lethal42. In a study by Mazurek et al.44, DDX5
knockdown induced apoptosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells but was well tolerated
in adult mice. Mice expressing DDX5 shRNAs were healthy, gained weight normally,
suffered no physiological defects, and had no deleterious effects on organ morphology44.
Similarly, Soucek and colleagues modeled the therapeutic impact of systemic Myc inhibition
in a Kras-induced lung cancer mouse model using a dominant-negative Myc allele45.

Conditional expression of the mutant (termed Omomyc) allele impeded initiation and
maintenance of Kras-induced lung adenomas by eliciting apoptosis in the tumors. On the
other hand, adult mice expressing Omomyc exhibited no significant differences compared to
control mice in terms of body weight, blood chemistry, and general health and activity45.
Organs with low proliferative indices were unaffected by MYC inhibition; however, highly
proliferative tissues such as skin and intestines did suffer from increased apoptosis,
degeneration, and decreased proliferation, effects that were reversible upon restoration of
Myc function. Another example illustrating the differential effects of suppressing a protein
in tumor cells versus normal tissues involves suppression of the translation initiation factor
eIF4E, which catalyzes the ribosome recruitment step of translation initiation. Suppression
of eIF4E in the Eµ-Myc lymphoma model significantly delayed MYC-dependent tumor
initiation by augmenting apoptosis and impairing cell division in premalignant B-cells21.
eIF4E suppression in adult mice resulted in a reduction in body weight and increased
apoptosis and loss of differentiation in the intestines, but these effects were reversible upon
DOX withdrawal21. These mouse models, like the shDHX9 mice described herein,
demonstrate that although a gene product may be essential, its partial suppression (as would
be expected from a small molecule inhibitor) may be well tolerated at the organismal level.

Although our study does not identify a single major pathway affected by DHX9 suppression
in tumor cells, its role in a multitude of cellular processes (see Introduction) may indicate a
higher dependency of tumor cells for this gene product. In the mouse, since the majority of
cells are not actively proliferating, but are instead quiescent46, these cells may have a lower
requirement for DHX9. Interestingly, DHX9 knockdown had no deleterious consequences in
tissues with high proliferative indices, such as the intestines and skin. This may be due to the
fact that although suppression is significant in these tissues, levels of remaining DHX9 are
sufficient to maintain normal cell function and prevent activation of a p53 response. It
should be noted that ex vivo, both tumor cells and normal diploid fibroblasts were
susceptible to DHX9 knockdown, although the specific effect elicited was different
(apoptosis versus senescence). The differential effects of DHX9 suppression observed in
vivo versus ex vivo in terms of cellular fitness and p53 pathway activation may be partly
attributed to cell culture stress. In a physiological environment, reduction in DHX9 levels
may be well tolerated. However, the added stress of being cultured ex vivo, at higher oxygen
levels and separated from their native extracellular matrix, may sensitize cells sufficiently to
activate a p53 stress response. The knockdown of DHX9 in vivo may not be as potent as
what can be achieved ex vivo, and may not reach a high enough threshold to activate p53.
Another possible explanation is that there may be some form of compensation for the
suppression of DHX9 in vivo – for example, upregulation of other replication factors. In
sum, our study demonstrates that DHX9 is dispensable for normal tissue homeostasis in the
adult mouse and warrants exploration of DHX9 as an anti-neoplastic target. What makes
DHX9 particularly attractive is that unlike other potential therapeutic targets that have been
explored using conditional shRNA mice21, 27, 45, its suppression does not have negative
effects on tissues harboring highly proliferative cells.

NIH3T3, Hela, and HEK293T/17 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA), and MRC-5 cells (a
kind gift from Dr. Nahum Sonenberg, McGill University, Canada) were maintained in
DMEM (Multicell, St-Bruno, QC, Canada). U2OS cells (ATCC) were maintained in McCoy
5A (Multicell). MCF-7 (ATCC), MDA-MB231 (ATCC), and JJN-3, KMS-11, IM-9,
RPMI8226, U266B1, H929, OPM1.1, and OPM2 cells (kindly provided by Dr. Michael
Sebag, McGill University, Canada) were maintained in RPMI-1640 media (Multicell). A549
cells (ATCC) were maintained in F12K (Multicell). All media was supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Multicell). ATCC authenticates all their cell lines using Short Tandem
Repeat profiling. Cells were not tested for mycoplasma contamination. Tsc2+/−Eµ−Myc
lymphoma cells were derived from tumors in Tsc2+/− mice crossed with Eµ−Myc mice and
inbred on the C57BL/6 (Charles River Laboratories) background for over ten generations.
Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc/R26-M2rtTA lymphomas were generated by crossing Tsc2+/−Eµ−Myc mice
with mice expressing the M2rtTA transgene at the Rosa26 locus and harvesting tumors from
the resultant triple transgenic progeny. Lymphomas were cultured in B-cell media (45%
DMEM, 45% Iscove’s media, 55 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 10% fetal bovine serum) on
irradiated Ink4A−/− MEF feeder layers.
Virus Generation and Transductions

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

For suppression of DHX9 in murine cell lines (NIH3T3 and Eµ-Myc lymphomas), shRNAs
targeting mouse DHX9 (DHX9.1241 and DHX9.1271) and a control shRNA targeting
renilla luciferase (RLuc.713) were transduced into cells using the MSCV/LTR/miR30/
PuroR-IRES-GFP (MLP) or MSCV/LTR/miR30/SV40-GFP (MLS) retroviral vectors
(Supplementary Table 1). Retroviral infections were performed using ecotropic Phoenix
packaging cells following established protocols (http://www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/
retroviral_systems/retsys.html). Briefly, 20 µg of plasmid were transfected into Phoenix
ecotropic cells in a 10 cm dish by calcium phosphate-mediated delivery. The media was
changed 12 hours later and 48 hours post-transfection, retroviral supernatant was collected
every 8 hours up to 72 hours and added to target cells. For infections using MLP, forty-eight
hours after the last transduction, stable integrants were selected using 2 µg/ml puromycin for
at least 3 days. For suppression of DHX9 in human cell lines, two shRNAs targeting human
DHX9 (DHX9.860 and DHX9.267) and a control shRNA targeting firefly luciferase (FLuc.
1309) were transduced into cells using pPrime-PGK-Puro (Addgene, Cambridge, MA, USA)
(Supplementary Table 1). Lentiviral transduction was performed following published
procedures47. Briefly, 15 µg of pPrime-PGK-Puro-shRNA, 7.5 µg of packaging plasmid
pSPAX2, and 3.75 µg of envelope-encoding vector, CMV-VSVG, were mixed and
transfected into HEK293T/17 cells in a 10 cm dish by calcium phosphate-mediated delivery.
Generation, genotyping, and induction of transgenic mice
Transgenic mice harboring a Rosa26 (R26)-m2rtTA allele and DHX9.837 or DHX9.1271
shRNAs under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter (TRE) were generated
through FLP/FRT-mediated site specific recombination at the Col1A1 locus on chromosome
11 by Mirimus (Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA). PCR was used for genotyping using

All mice strains were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. Induction of shRNA
expression was performed in 4-week-old shRNA/rtTA mice by supplying doxycycline
(DOX) at 1 mg/ml in the drinking water (plus 5% sucrose) for 14 days (for short-term
experiments) or 6 months (for long-term experiments). The DOX-supplemented water was
changed every 4 days. All animal studies were approved by the McGill University Faculty of
Medicine Animal Care Committee.
Immunohistochemical analysis and TUNEL staining of mouse tissues

Author Manuscript

Tissues from shRNA/rtTA mice were harvested, fixed in 10% formalin for 48h, and
embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 µm) were deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated
through a series of decreasing ethanol washes (100%, 95%, and 75%), followed by washing
in water for 2 × 5 minutes. Antigen retrieval was performed by boiling the slides in 10 mM
citric acid buffer [pH 6.0] for 15 minutes. Immunohistochemistry was performed using the
HRP/DAB Detection Kit (ab64261; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions and as previously described21. The following primary antibodies
and dilutions were used: DHX9 (ab26271; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) (1:100 dilution),
GFP (#2555; Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA, USA) (1:800 dilution), turboGFP (AB514;
Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) (1:5000 dilution) and Ki-67 (Sp6; Neomarkers, Fremont, Ca,
USA). After visualizing the signal using DAB chromogen and substrate, sections were
counterstained with hematoxylin, destained with 0.5% HCl in 70% ethanol, incubated with
0.2% lithium carbonate, and rinsed with tap water. The sections were then dehydrated
through an ethanol gradient (75%, 95%, and 100% ethanol), followed by xylene washes (2 ×
5 minutes), and mounted using Permount (Fisher, Ottawa, ON, Canada). Sections were
scanned using an Aperio ScanScope XT (Aperio Technologies, Vista, CA, USA). TUNEL
staining was performed using the In situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR-Red
(#12156792910; Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Images were taken with a LSM 510 Meta Confocor2 Confocal Microscope (Zeiss) at 40X
magnification and the percentage of apoptotic cells quantitated using ImageJ (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA).

Ex vivo competition assays

Ex vivo competition assays were performed by transducing cells with MLS-based (for
mouse cells) or pPrime-PGK-puro-based (for human cells) shRNAs. The percentage of
GFP-positive cells was measured 48h after the final infection (t=0) using a GUAVA
EasyCyte HT flow cytometer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Cell death was assessed by
staining cells with 4 µg/ml propidium iodide (PI) and measuring the percentage of PIpositive cells. For competition assays using the DOX-inducible vector TRMPV, Tsc2+/−Eµ-

Myc/R26-M2rtTA cells were transduced with TRMPV-shRNA and FAC-sorted to obtain a
pure Venus+ population. shRNA expression was induced by treatment with vehicle or 1
µg/ml DOX and cell death assessed by staining with Fixable Viability Dye eFluor450
(eBioscience) and measuring the percentage of stained cells using a LSRII cytometer (BD
Biosciences).
In vivo competition assays

Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc cells were transduced with MLS-based shRNAs and two days postinfection, 106 cells were injected into the tail vein of C57BL/6 recipients (not randomized or
blinded to the investigator). Mice were monitored until they reached terminal disease stage
(characterized by the appearance of tumors, decreased activity, hunched posture,
dehydration, paralysis, and weight loss), at which point the spleen was harvested and
analyzed for GFP-positive B-cells using flow cytometry.

Survival analysis following tumor transplantation

Tsc2+/−Eµ-Myc/R26-M2rtTA lymphoma cells were transduced with TRMPV retroviruses
expressing shRNAs to RLuc, DHX9 or L15, FAC-sorted to obtain a pure Venus+ population,
and 106 cells were introduced into 10 C57BL/6 mice for each shRNA via tail-vein injection.
6 days post-injection, 5 mice for each shRNA was treated with 1 mg/ml DOX (in 5%
sucrose) and the other 5 mice were treated with 5% sucrose. The mice were sacrificed when
they reached terminal disease stage, at which point the spleen was harvested and the
percentages of B220+, Venus+, and dsRed+ cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. The
survival (number of days to reach terminal stage) of each mouse was plotted on a KaplanMeier curve using Graphpad Prism (v. 5.03, GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA)
and the p-values determined using the Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test.

Histopathological analysis was performed on representative tissues extracted from FLuc.1309/rtTADHX9.837/rtTA, and DHX9.1271/rtTA mice treated
with 1 mg/ml DOX for 6 months. Multifocal, random microgranulomas (Grade 1) were present in the liver of all mice analyzed and are likely a
consequence of non-specific bacterial or viral infection. One DHX9.837/rtTA (+DOX) liver sample displayed moderate hepatic lipidosis which was not
observed in the DHX9.1271/rtTA liver sample.
