Abstract
Expression of the human papillomavirus 16 E6 oncogene
interferes with several vital cellular processes, including the
p53-dependent response to DNA damage. To assess the
influence of E6 on the early response to DNA damage, we
analyzed gene expression following mitomycin C–induced
genotoxic stress in human E6–expressing U2OS cells
(U2OSE64b) as well as in p53-expressing control cells
(U2OSE6AS) by comparative global expression profiling. As
expected, genes involved in p53-dependent pathways were
activated in p53-expressing cells. In the U2OSE64b cells,
however, a largely nonoverlapping group of genes was
identified, including two splicing factors of the SR family.
Immunoblot analysis revealed increased expression of several
SR proteins during the early response to DNA damage, which
was accompanied by activation of alternative splicing activity.
Disruption of splicing activity by treatment with small
interfering RNA directed against splicing factor SRp55
resulted in the increased viability of p53-deficient cells
following DNA damage. To determine whether the transient
activation of splicing activity was due to E6-mediated
degradation of p53, or was due to some other activity of E6,
we compared the early response of the p53 wild-type and
p53 / isogenic HCT116 cell lines, and found that the
increase in splicing activity was observed only in the absence
of p53. Finally, both the U2OSE64b and the p53 / cells
showed altered splicing patterns for the CD44 receptor.
Together, these data show that cells lacking p53 can activate
alternative splicing following DNA damage. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Genotoxic stresses from chemical, physical, or viral agents
initiate damage response pathways that lead to cell cycle arrest,
DNA repair, and apoptosis (1, 2). The mechanisms by which these
cellular responses are triggered are not fully understood, but it is
clear that the p53 tumor repressor is one of the most important
checkpoint proteins, influencing multiple response pathways to a
diversity of stressors (3).
However, p53 is not indispensable for the induction of apoptosis
(4, 5). This has clinical relevance, as more than half of human
tumors lack wild-type p53. Therefore, if apoptosis is to be induced

in these cells, p53-independent pathways must be engaged. This is
particularly true in cervical carcinoma cases caused by human
papillomavirus (HPV) 16 infection, as the viral E6 protein
effectively eliminates cellular p53 by accelerating its proteolysis
(6). E6-expressing cells, therefore, can function as a model system
for discovering and studying p53-independent, DNA damage–
triggered apoptotic pathways.
In contrast to the well-established role of transcriptional
regulation, alternative splicing is only now emerging as an
important mechanism for regulating gene function. It has been
estimated that at least 74% of multi-exon genes are alternatively
spliced (7), and these isoforms frequently have opposing functions.
This may have a significant effect on a variety of cell processes,
including apoptosis (8).
There is now ample evidence that aberrations of alternative
splicing are widespread in tumors (9). Although the relationship
between changes in splicing and tumor progression has not yet
been well-defined, condition-dependent splicing alterations in such
genes as FAS, RBM9, CD44, hnRNPA/B, APLP2, and MYL6 were
found in breast cancer cells by using splicing-sensitive microarrays
(10). Despite growing interest in splicing regulation and the
discovery of a large number of genes involved in pre–RNA splicing,
the mechanisms governing this process are not well-understood
(11). It is believed that alternative splicing activity is regulated by
the combinatorial actions of a fairly large number of regulatory
factors, including two families of proteins that generally function in
an antagonistic manner, heterogeneous ribonucleoproteins and SR
(serine/arginine-rich) proteins (12).
SR proteins participate in both constitutive and alternative
splicing. Although they seem to be functionally redundant in
constitutive splicing, a growing body of evidence shows that they
have distinctive and not fully overlapping functions in alternative
splicing. Each particular SR protein is able to bind to a specific
splicing enhancer and activate splicing of weak splicing sites,
leading to altered splicing patterns of target genes (12).
In this report, we have investigated the early response of the
osteosarcoma U2OSE64b (E6-expressing) and colon carcinoma
HCT116 p53 / cell lines to DNA damage caused by the genotoxic
drug mitomycin C. The results from this study provide strong
evidence that alternative splicing activity can be involved in
regulating the stress response in the absence of the classical p53dependent pathways.

of the pHA-E6S and pHA-E6AS plasmids, which respectively, contain either
the sense or the antisense versions of epitope-tagged E6 (HA-E6) under the
control of the CMV promoter, and establishment of the U2OSE64b and
U2OSE6AS cell lines by stable transfection with these plasmids, have been
described previously (14).
Measurement of mitomycin C cytotoxicity. To measure cell survival
following mitomycin C treatment, cells in exponential growth were exposed
to mitomycin C (Roche) at the concentrations noted for the individual
experiments. After incubation for the indicated time, the number of viable
cells was quantified by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay as described earlier (14). Three independent
experiments were each conducted in triplicate and significance was
analyzed by Student’s t test.
Immunoblot analysis. Proteins were extracted from cells (106) in 100 AL
of Laemmli’s buffer. Lysates were sonicated and protein concentration was
determined by the D C protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates (15 Ag) were
separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto Immobilon
P membranes (Millipore). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies
directed against p53 (NCL-p53-DO7; Novocastra), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1; Ab-2; EMD Biosciences), phosphorylated Chk1 (phosphoChk1-Ser345; Cell Signaling Technology), h-actin (Sigma), or pan-SR (1H4;
American Type Culture Collection). After washing, membranes were
incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma), and bands were detected using the SuperSignal
West Substrate System (Pierce). Densitometry measurements were done
using the ChemImager Imaging System and processed with the AlphaEase
software package (Alpha Innotech).
Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. Reverse transcriptasePCR (RT-PCR) analysis was used to estimate transcript levels in total RNA
samples isolated from cell cultures. Ten micrograms of total RNA was used
as a template for cDNA synthesis with SuperScript III reverse transcriptase
and an oligo(dT) primer according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen). The cDNA obtained was normalized by PCR with primers
specific to cofilin1 (CFL1), a gene that showed no change in expression in
microarray experiments (CCTTCCCAAACTGCTTTTGAT and CTGGTCCTGCTTCCATGAGTA). Serial dilutions of the normalized cDNA samples
were used to find the linear range of amplification for gene-specific DNA
fragments. PCR was done at 94jC for 30 s, at 57jC for 30 s, and at 72jC
for 1 min for 35 cycles using Taq DNA polymerase and the recommended
protocol (NEB). For the SRFS6 gene, primers were CAGGTCGAGTTCCAGAGATTA and TCAAACTGCAATTTCAACTCA. CD44-specific primers were taken from ref. (15).
Expression profiling by microarray analysis. Total RNA was extracted
using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and additionally purified using the RNeasy
kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA samples
from three independent replicates for each time point were further
processed and hybridized to Affymetrix Human Genome U133A and U133B
expression arrays according to standard recommended protocols (Affymetrix) at the DNA MicroArray Facility, University of California (Irvine, CA). To
extract and analyze microarray data, we used the Microarray Suite 5.0,
GCOS 1.2, and Data Mining Tools 3.0 programs (Affymetrix). To compare
data from different arrays, the signal intensities of the arrays were globally
scaled to 500 and normalization was done using a probe set of 100
constitutively expressed transcripts provided by Affymetrix. The signal log
ratio was calculated by comparing transcripts between mitomycin C–
treated and untreated cells. Generation of detected (present or absent) and
changed (increased or decreased) calls was done using the Wilcoxon test
and default variables of P value cutoffs. During the first step to identify
genes with altered expression, we discarded genes that had changed calls in
less than six out of nine comparative files (Rank test) as well as genes that
had ‘‘absent’’ calls in all microarrays. The remaining genes were further
analyzed using both a Student’s t test and the Mann-Whitney test (P < 0.05
cutoffs). Genes were considered up-regulated if they passed the MannWhitney and Rank tests, and down-regulated if they passed the Rank and
t tests.
Quantitative in vivo analysis of alternative splicing activity. Cells
(5  105) were transfected with the pLuc14 plasmid containing a tau

minigene fused to luciferase (16) as described previously (17) and split into
a 96-well plate 24 h later. At 48 h posttransfection, cells were treated with
2 Ag/mL of mitomycin C for the indicated amount of time and harvested in
luciferase lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was quantified using a
MicroLumatPlus microplate reader (Berthold Technology). Three independent experiments, were each conducted in triplicate, and significance was
analyzed by one-way ANOVA. Differences were considered significant at a
0.05 level of confidence.
Inhibition of SFRS6 gene expression by small interfering RNA. Cells
were transfected with predesigned small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for the
human SFRS6 gene from Ambion or from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, or with
control siRNA using the siRNA transfection kit as recommended by the
manufacturer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Levels of silencing of the SFRS6
gene were evaluated by RT-PCR and immunoblot analyses as described
above. Twenty-four hours posttransfection, cells were treated with
mitomycin C for 24 h, followed by quantification of viable cells by the
MTT assay (14). Three independent experiments were done, each was
conducted in quadruplicate, and significance was analyzed by one-way
ANOVA. Differences were considered significant at a 0.05 level of
confidence.

Results
E6 decreases the level of cellular p53, but does not inhibit
cell death following DNA damage. Our laboratory has previously
shown that in U2OS cells in which E6 expression is regulated by a
tetracycline-responsive promoter, increased amounts of E6 led to a
dose-dependent decrease in p53 as measured by p53 ELISA (17).
This suggested that E6 might decrease apoptosis triggered by
genotoxic stress. To test this possibility, cells expressing E6
(U2OSE64b) and control cells transfected with an antisense variant
of E6 (U2OSE6AS) were treated with mitomycin C, a potent
genotoxic agent (18). Surprisingly, the two cell lines responded in a
very similar manner to mitomycin C treatment, either as assessed
by changing the dose of drug or by changing the duration of
treatment (Fig. 1A). At the same time, the p53 immunoblot analysis
clearly showed that although the concentration of p53 in
U2OSE64b cells did increase somewhat during treatment, the
overall level of p53 was reduced by at least 10-fold as compared
with the control U2OSE6AS cells (Fig. 1B). In fact, the level of p53
in U2OSE64b cells after 5 h of treatment was comparable to that
seen in the untreated U2OSE6AS cells.
Next, we monitored CHK1 kinase activation, one of the first steps
of the DNA damage response (19), using an antibody specific for its
phosphorylated form. Accumulation of activated CHK1 kinase was
observed in both cell lines, showing that these cell lines responded
similarly to the genotoxic stress at this level (Fig. 1C). To evaluate
whether mitomycin C treatment of U2OS cells causes cell death
through apoptosis and to evaluate its progression, we analyzed
PARP-1 cleavage in the treated cells. PARP-1 is activated in
response to DNA damage by cleavage into two apoptosis-specific
fragments of 24 and 89 kDa (20, 21). Analysis of PARP-1 cleavage
during mitomycin C treatment revealed the presence of the
apoptosis-specific 89 kDa fragment within the first 24 h of
treatment with 2 Ag/mL of mitomycin C in both cell lines,
indicating that they underwent apoptosis (Fig. 1D).
E6 alters the set of genes affected by DNA damage. The
survival experiments described above indicated that the cytotoxicity of mitomycin C for both U2OS-derived cell lines was
essentially equivalent. However, the differences in p53 levels
suggested that the pathways involved might be quite different.
Because we were interested in the early response of cells to DNA
damage, we decided to evaluate the global changes in expression

Activation of Alternative Splicing by DNA Damage

after 5 h of treatment with 2 Ag/mL of mitomycin C. Based on the
time of CHK1 kinase activation, at this drug concentration and
time of treatment, the cells should have begun to respond to the
insult. RNA samples were extracted from both cell lines, with and
without mitomycin C treatment, and subjected to microarray
analysis. According to the criteria outlined in Materials and
Methods, we found 38 genes in U2OSE6AS cells and 22 genes in
U2OSE64b cells that showed statistically significant up-regulation
or down-regulation (Tables 1 and 2).
Only five genes with altered expression had similar expression
profiles in both cell lines. Three genes were down-regulated:
centromere protein A, transcription regulator CUTL1, and a gene
encoding the putative protein DKFZp762E1312. Two genes were
found to be up-regulated in both cell lines: NOXA, a proapoptotic
member of the Bcl-2 family (22), and the stress-activated gene
encoding sestrin 2 (23).

Fifteen genes were identified as up-regulated in U2OSE6AS cells
by microarray analysis, with 13 of them representing genes with
identified functions (Table 1). Among these genes, seven have welldocumented relationships to p53-dependent apoptosis, including
MDM2, ATF3, BTG2, PPM1D, NOXA, SESN2, and TP53INP1 (24–30).
These data show that, as expected, DNA damage activated the p53mediated response in U2OSE6AS cells.
A separate group of 22 genes with statistically significantly
altered expression was identified in U2OSE64b cells treated with
mitomycin C (Table 2). Interestingly, unlike the group of genes upregulated in U2OSE6AS cells, more than half of the genes with
increased expression in U2OSE64b cells (10 out of 18) are poorly
characterized or entirely unknown.
Among the genes with known functions that are up-regulated,
three participate in cell cycle regulation and five participate in the
regulation of transcription and RNA processing. Interestingly, three

incubated for 16 h with the indicated concentrations of mitomycin C (left ) or treated with 2 Ag/mL of mitomycin C for the indicated times (right ) and subjected to
the MTT test. Measurements were made in triplicate; bars, SD. B, C, and D, U2OSE64b and U2OSE6AS cells were incubated for the indicated times with 2 Ag/mL
of mitomycin C and analyzed by immunoblot with antibodies directed against p53 (B ), the phosphorylated form of CHK1 (C), and PARP-1 (D ). The h-actin antibodies
were used for re-blotting to verify uniformity of sample loading.

Activation of Alternative Splicing by DNA Damage

genes are directly involved in RNA splicing, and two of them, SFRS6
and SFRS7, belong to the SR splicing factor family (31).
Splicing factors and alternative splicing activity are induced
in U2OSE64b cells following DNA damage. To determine
whether up-regulated transcription of genes encoding the splicing
factors also corresponded to an increase at the protein level, we did
immunoblot analysis using the pan-SR protein antibody, 1H4,
which has been shown to recognize four human members of this
family (32). In addition to increased protein levels for SRp55
encoded by SFRS6, we also found increased protein levels for the
splicing factors SRp30 and SRp40 (Fig. 2A). Only one of the splicing
factors reactive with this antibody, SRp75, did not show an obvious
change following treatment, whereas the other three SR splicing
factors had a peak of expression at 5 h posttreatment. To determine
whether this decrease was due to the lack of p53 or to some other
activity of E6, we monitored SR protein expression in two isogenic
cell lines: HCT116, which expresses wild-type p53, and HCT116
p53 / . Results from the immunoblot analysis clearly showed that

increased expression of the SRp55 splicing factor was seen only in
the cells lacking p53 (Fig. 2B), indicating that it was the p53degradatory activity of E6 that was responsible for SRp55 upregulation.
The results obtained by both microarray and immunoblot
analyses showed enhanced expression of splicing factors in p53depleted cells following genotoxic stress. To determine whether
this increase led to a change in splicing activity, we measured
alternative splicing activity using a cell-based analysis developed
by Yu et al. (16). This analysis allows quantification of exclusion of
the alternate exon 10 of the human tau gene by measurement of
luciferase activity. The luciferase gene in this construct is fused to
the mini-tau gene and is in-frame only when exon 10 is spliced out
(Fig. 2C). This system provided a particularly attractive model for
testing our results, as it has previously been shown that
overexpression of splicing factors SRp20, SRp40, and SRp55
significantly increased the exclusion of exon 10 from the construct
(16). Therefore, to evaluate alternative splicing activity after DNA

treatment, alternative splicing activity was found to be essentially
the same in both U2OS cell lines. A sharp increase in luciferase
activity was also detected following mitomycin treatment in p53deficient but not in p53-proficient HCT116 cells.

response to genotoxic stress, its expression was silenced by siRNA
inhibition and the resulting sensitivity to mitomycin C treatment
was evaluated by the MTT assay. To ensure that the silencing effect
was specific, we did these survival experiments using two
independently designed siRNAs. Transfection of U2OSE64b cells
with each of these two siRNAs led to a sharp decrease in the
corresponding mRNA level as estimated by semiquantitative RTPCR (Fig. 3A) and was accompanied by a substantial decrease in
the SRp55 protein concentration (Fig. 3B). SRp55-depleted cells
were then tested for cell viability following mitomycin C treatment.
With both siRNA species, p53-deficient U2OSE64b, but not
U2OSE6AS, cells showed a significantly higher resistance to drug
treatment in the absence of SRp55 expression (Fig. 3C). The same
tendency was observed with the HCT116 cells. Depletion of SRp55
activity in HCT116 p53 / cells resulted in an increased resistance
to mitomycin C at concentrations between 2 and 10 Ag/mL,
whereas it did not affect the sensitivity of the cells with wild-type
p53 (Fig. 3D).

Mitomycin C treatment of U2OSE64b cells leads to alternative splicing of the CD44 gene. In spite of substantial progress in
our understanding of alternative splicing regulation, only a few
genes have been identified as direct targets of splicing activation
(33). CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein with more than 30 identified
splice forms, has 10 variable exons, which are located between
constant exons 5 and 6 (Fig. 4A). The splicing pattern of inclusion/
exclusion of variable exons has been shown to be sensitive to the
activities of several splicing factors including 9G8, ASF/SF2, and
SRp20 (34). To test whether CD44 was sensitive to the activity of
the SRp55 splicing factor, we compared the expressions of several
known splice forms of this gene in control and SRp55-depleted
U2OS cells using combinations of forward and reverse primers that
were able to recognize several CD44 isoforms (Fig. 4A). This
comparison showed that isoforms containing v7 and v10 exons
were very sensitive to the absence of SRp55 activity (Fig. 4B, top).
Monitoring of CD44 splicing following mitomycin C treatment of
U2OSE64b cells revealed that the predominant standard CD44

with the v6 exon were up-regulated after 5 and 10 h of treatment,
whereas levels of splice variants with the v7 and v10 exons were
lower after 5 h of exposure to the drug (Fig. 4B, bottom). Interestingly,
this time period coincided with the increased alternative splicing
activity detected by in vivo measurement (Fig. 2D).
The set of CD44 isoforms presented by the HCT116 cells differs
in several ways from that seen in the U2OS cells (Fig. 4C, top).
Variants that incorporate exon v7 sequences were completely
absent in HCT116 cells; the major isoform containing the v6 exon
in HCT116 cells belonged to the type 15 variant (545 bp band)
compared with the 188 bp major band in U2OS cells (compatible
with variant types 6, 11, and 14); and for exon 10, the major
HCT116-specific variant was the epithelial variant type 5 (396 bp
band), whereas the lower 204 bp band corresponding to the type 2
and 3 variants was more abundant in U2OS cells (nomenclature of
CD44 isoforms is according to ref. 35). Monitoring CD44 splicing
following mitomycin C treatment of HCT116 p53 / cells revealed

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (16). August 15, 2007

that as in the case of U2OSE64b, this pattern changed at the time of
increased alternative splicing activity. We found that after 5 h of
treatment, isoforms that incorporate v6 are up-regulated whereas
v10-containing variants become less abundant (Fig. 4C, bottom),
showing a tendency similar to that observed in U2OSE64b cells.

Discussion
The overall aim of most chemotherapeutic and radiotherapeutic approaches to cancer treatment is to induce apoptosis in
tumor cells. The p53-mediated pathway is clearly an important
mechanism for DNA damage–initiated apoptotic signaling, yet the
correspondence between the p53 status of tumors and their
response to such therapies is far from perfect. For this reason,
and because more than half of human tumors lack functional p53,
it is essential to understand p53-independent pathways to
apoptosis and how they are triggered. One system in which this
understanding is particularly critical includes those tumors

Activation of Alternative Splicing by DNA Damage

(primarily cervical carcinomas) that express HPV16 E6. E6 is best
known for its ability to degrade p53, although our laboratory and
others have shown multiple additional functions (see ref. 36 and
references therein). The aim of this present study was to evaluate
the early response to genotoxic stress when the p53 pathway is
compromised by either the absence of p53 or by the presence of
HPV16 E6.
We compared the genotoxic stress response in two pairs of cell
lines. The first pair consisted of human osteosarcoma U2OS cells
that stably expressed E6, U2OSE64b, or its antisense construct,
U2OSE6AS, which was used as a control. To determine whether
the changes in response were due the effects of E6 on p53
stability or to some other E6 activity, we employed a second pair
of cell lines, HCT116, expressing wild-type p53 and its isogenic
derivative HCT116 p53 / (13). Immunoblot analysis of the
U2OS-derived cells treated with mitomycin C showed that, as
expected, the presence of E6 caused a sharp decrease in both
baseline and induced levels of p53, (Fig. 1B), and in the HCT116
cells, a complete absence of p53 expression was detected in the
null mutant (Fig. 2B ). Survival experiments showed that
expression of E6 in the U2OS cell lines did not alter sensitivity
to treatment with mitomycin C, suggesting that U2OSE64b cells
were able to effectively use p53-independent apoptotic pathways
(Fig. 1A).
To examine changes at an early stage of the genotoxic stress
response, we chose the 5 h exposure to 2 Ag/mL of mitomycin C for
expression analysis because CHK1 activation was already observed
by this time, although the treated cells had not yet experienced
PARP-1 cleavage, a hallmark of apoptosis (Fig. 1D). Consistent with
the idea that an early response was being observed in our analysis,
we found the global changes in transcription to be modest, both
with respect to the number of identified genes with altered
expression and with the magnitude of the differences.
Comparative global expression profiling confirmed the idea
that p53 depletion by E6 expression significantly changes the set
of genes engaged in the early response to DNA damage (Tables 1
and 2). Intriguingly, almost half of the identified up-regulated
genes in U2OSE64b cells were genes with unidentified functions,
suggesting the involvement of new and uncharacterized pathways
and mechanisms in these cells. One of the most striking and
unexpected observations of the microarray analysis was the
induction of the SFRS6 and SFRS7 genes in E6-expressing cells.
These genes code for proteins that belong to a family of 16
currently known human SR proteins which play a pivotal role in
both constitutive and alternative regulation of RNA splicing (31).
Immunoblotting using a pan-SR antibody (32) not only confirmed
the up-regulation of the SRp55 protein, encoded by the SFRS6
gene, but also revealed the up-regulation of two other splicing
factors, SRp30 and SRp40, in U2OS-derived cells (Fig. 2A). SRp55
was also observed to be up-regulated in HCT116 p53 / cells
(Fig. 2B). In addition, the observed increase of up to 50% in
alternative splicing activity for the U2OS-derived cells (Fig. 2D), as
well as a significant up-regulation in the HCT116 cells, shows that
these changes in transcript and protein levels have a functional
consequence. It is of interest to note that the profile of SR protein
expression in U2OSE64b cells coincides with that of alternative
splicing activity, suggesting that alternative splicing activation
may be due to up-regulation of SR protein expression. The fact
that similar responses were seen in the U2OS- and HCT116derived cell lines indicates that the observed transient increase of
alternative splicing activity was not specific to U2OS cells. It also

www.aacrjournals.org

points out that the response is dependent on the p53 status of a
cell, and that it is therefore most likely the E6-p53 interaction
that causes the increase in alternative splicing, rather than some
other activity of E6.
A growing number of new findings including those involving
MDM2 and MDM4 (37), SRPK1 (38), and TAF1 (39) show not only
the existence of connections between the DNA damage response
and changes in splicing, but also that these connections are
functional. The results from this present study add another
example to the literature regarding alternative splicing regulation,
by showing a clear connection between DNA damage, splicing
factor induction, and activation of alternative splicing.
The hypothesis that the activation of alternative splicing activity
during the early response results in altered splicing patterns of
target genes was verified by our identification of the CD44 gene as
a target for which the splicing profiles changed dramatically within
the first 5 h of drug treatment. CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein
involved in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions, is an example of a
gene with multiple splice variants that are thought to affect events
connected to cell proliferation and survival as well as adhesion and
motility (40).
We found that CD44 isoforms containing v7 and v10 exons were
highly responsive to the depletion of SRp55 activity in U2OS cells
(Fig. 4B). Silencing of the SRp55 gene promotes an increase in the
v7 360 bp band, which is compatible with CD44 variant types 7
(pmeta-2), 11, and 14 (35), and this variant decreases during the
first 5 h of mitomycin treatment of U2OSE64b cells. Interestingly,
the disappearance of this CD44v7 isoform after 5 h of treatment,
and its reappearance after 10 h, coincides with the profile of SRp55
expression in these mitomycin C–treated cells, implying that its
activity may be directly involved in v7-specific splicing regulation.
Comparison of CD44 expression in U2OS and HCT116 cells
revealed that its splicing patterns were cell type–specific. CD44
isoforms containing the v7 exon, which are induced in SRp55depleted U2OS cells, are practically absent in HCT116, whereas the
pattern of HCT116-specific isoforms detected by the v10 primer
was very similar to that observed in U2OS cells following SRp55
depletion (Fig. 4B and C). Nevertheless, in spite of different
baseline splicing patterns, the tendency of mitomycin C treatment
to up-regulate the v6 isoforms and down-regulate the v10 isoforms
is the same in both p53-deficient cell lines (Fig. 4A and C).
Finally, experiments using siRNA to inhibit SFRS6 gene
expression show that the contributions of this SR protein to
alternative splicing activity modify the genotoxic stress response in
p53-deficient cells. Depletion of the SRp55 splicing factor in both
U2OSE64b and HCT116 p53 / cells resulted in a significant
increase in cell viability following treatment with the genotoxic
drug (Fig. 3C). This increase is particularly remarkable given the
fact that the up-regulation of alternative splicing activity was timedependent and was observed only within the first 8 h of treatment
(Fig. 2D). These data suggest that in the absence of a p53-mediated
response, splicing can be heavily involved in the modulation of
cellular responses.
Alternative splicing is being increasingly recognized as a
fundamental mechanism for the generation of protein diversity
and as an important source of variability and complexity. It
provides an additional mechanism for genes to be differentially
expressed throughout development, and the loss of splicing fidelity,
which often occurs during tumorigenesis, can result in the
production of aberrant and alternative splice isoforms (9). It
is worth noting that more than half of all human tumors lack

wild-type p53, and the observed influence of p53 status on
alternative splicing activity regulation in response to low doses of
DNA-damaging agents may contribute to an increased loss of
alternative splicing regulation in tumors. In this context, it is worth
noting that p53 status has been linked to the presence or absence
of aberrant transcripts in cancer cells (41, 42). The results of this
report, together with observations described previously (37, 39),
show the involvement of alternative splicing activity in modulating
the response to genotoxic stress and provide new insights into the
functions of alternative splicing.
