Abstract
Antiestrogens such as tamoxifen are widely used in the clinic
to treat estrogen receptor–positive breast tumors. Resistance
to tamoxifen can occur either de novo or develop over time in
a large proportion of these tumors. Additionally, resistance is
associated with enhanced motility and invasiveness in vitro.
One molecule that has been implicated in tamoxifen resistance, breast cancer antiestrogen resistance-3 (BCAR3), has
also been shown to regulate migration of fibroblasts. In this
study, we investigated the role of BCAR3 in breast cancer cell
migration and invasion. We found that BCAR3 was highly
expressed in multiple breast cancer cell lines, where it
associated with another protein, p130Cas (also known as
breast cancer antiestrogen resistance-1; BCAR1), that plays a
role in both tamoxifen resistance and cell motility. In cells
with relatively low migratory potential, BCAR3 overexpression
resulted in enhanced migration and colocalization with
p130Cas at the cell membrane. Conversely, BCAR3 depletion
from more aggressive breast cancer cell lines inhibited
migration and invasion. This coincided with a relocalization
of p130Cas away from the cell membrane and an attenuated
response to epidermal growth factor stimulation that was
characterized by a loss of membrane ruffles, decreased
migration toward EGF, and disruption of p130Cas/Crk complexes. Based on these data, we propose that the spatial and
temporal regulation of BCAR3/p130Cas interactions within the
cell is important for controlling breast cancer cell motility.

Introduction
Breast cancer will be diagnosed in over 200,000 American
women this year and a large percentage of these individuals will be
treated with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Unfortunately, a substantial number of breast tumors either do not respond to initial
treatment with tamoxifen or become nonresponsive over time,
despite continued expression of the estrogen receptor (ER).
Clinically, tamoxifen resistance is associated with poor prognosis
and outcome (1). Several molecules have been shown to regulate
antiestrogen resistance, including epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and the adapter molecule breast cancer

antiestrogen resistance-1 (BCAR1; also known as p130Cas; refs. 2, 3).
A second protein, BCAR3 (the human homologue of the murine
protein AND-34), was identified in a genetic screen along with
BCAR1 as a gene product whose overexpression conferred
tamoxifen resistance in vitro (4). BCAR3 is a member of the novel
Src homology 2 (SH2)–containing protein (NSP) family that
includes two other members, Chat/SHEP1 and NSP1. These
proteins share a common domain structure consisting of an
amino-terminal SH2 domain and a carboxyl-terminal domain with
sequence homology to the Cdc25-family of guanine nucleotide
exchange factors (GEF). Several studies have shown that BCAR3
expression results in the activation of numerous small GTPases,
including Rap1, R-Ras, RalA, Cdc42, and Rac1 (5–7). The carboxylterminal domain of BCAR3 has been shown to bind to the carboxyl
terminus of p130Cas, providing additional support for a functional
relationship between these proteins (5).
In a previous study, we showed that co-overexpression of BCAR3
and p130Cas in fibroblasts promoted cell migration, and this
coincided with translocation of ectopic p130Cas to the leading edge
of the cell (8). Other NSP family members have been shown to have
similar functions. For example, migration of COS-7 cells toward
EGF was elevated in cells that overexpressed Chat/SHEP1 and was
further augmented by p130Cas overexpression. EGF stimulation of
these cells resulted in colocalization of Chat and p130Cas at
membrane ruffles (9).
Although BCAR3 function has been implicated in antiestrogenresistant proliferation of breast cancer cells (4, 10), its role in breast
cancer cell motility has not been established. In this study, we used a
panel of breast cancer cell lines that vary in stage and aggressiveness to investigate the potential role of BCAR3 in migration and
invasion. We found that BCAR3 was expressed and in complex with
p130Cas in the majority of these breast cancer cells. In cells with
relatively low migratory potential, BCAR3 overexpression resulted
in enhanced migration and colocalization with p130Cas at the cell
membrane. Conversely, BCAR3 depletion from more aggressive
breast cancer cell lines inhibited migration and invasion, caused a
relocalization of p130Cas away from the cell membrane, and
attenuated the cellular response to EGF stimulation. Taken together,
these data suggest that BCAR3 may regulate breast cancer cell
migration by localizing p130Cas to the cell membrane, thereby
spatially coordinating multiple signaling pathways.

medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, 4.5 g/L glucose, 0.2 units/mL bovine insulin, 100 units/mL penicillin,
and 100 Ag/mL streptomycin. Cells were starved for 16 h in serum-free DMEM
before EGF stimulation (100 ng/mL; Receptor Grade EGF, Sigma).
Antibodies. Polyclonal BCAR3 antisera were generated by immunizing
rabbits with a 15-amino-acid BCAR3 peptide, TLPRKKKGPPPIRSC,
conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Covance Research Products).
This peptide, which spans amino acids 50 to 64, is not present in other NSP
family members. Antibodies recognizing phosphotyrosine (pTyr; 4G10;
Upstate Biotechnology), Crk (BD/Transduction Laboratories), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies),
and FLAG (Sigma) were obtained from the indicated sources. Texas red–
phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes. CasB antisera and
p130Cas monoclonal antibody 6G11 have been described previously (11).
FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse and Texas red–conjugated goat antirabbit antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch.
RNA interference, plasmid transfection, and protein detection. A
small interfering RNA (siRNA) oligonucleotide (AAAUCAACCGGACAGUUCU)
was synthesized to target human but not murine BCAR3 (Dharmacon).
MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells were plated into 60-mm or 10-cm tissue culture
plates and incubated overnight. Cells were treated with H2O (vehicle),
20 Amol/L control nontargeting siRNA (Dharmacon), or 20 Amol/L BCAR3specific siRNAs using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) transfection reagent as
per manufacturer’s specifications. BCAR3 was expressed by nucleofection
of plasmids encoding full-length BCAR3 (Origene) or FLAG-AND-34 as
per manufacturer’s specifications (Amaxa Corporation).
Cell lysis, immunoprecipitation, and immunoblotting. Cells were
lysed in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 1% Ipegal CA-630, 0.5% deoxycholate]
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (100 Amol/L
leupeptin, 1 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.15 unit/mL aprotinin,
and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate). Protein concentrations were
determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay kit (Pierce). Immunoprecipitations were done as described previously (8). Proteins were resolved by
SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, immunoblotted with the indicated
antibodies, and detected by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated antimouse or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham) followed by HRP
Substrate Luminol Reagent (Millipore).
Confocal microscopy and immunofluorescence. Cells were plated
onto coverslips coated with 15 Ag/mL fibronectin and allowed to spread for
4 to 5 h. Cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 20 min and
permeabilized using 0.4% Triton X-100 in PBS for 6 min at room
temperature. Cells were incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin (BSA)/
PBS for 30 min, primary antibodies in 2% BSA/PBS for 1 h, followed by
Texas red–conjugated goat anti-rabbit, FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse,
and/or Texas red–phalloidin for 1 h. Coverslips were mounted using
Vectashield (Vector Labs) or Prolong Gold Antifade with 4¶,6-diamidino-2phenylindole (Molecular Probes) for detection of nuclei. For confocal
images, cells were visualized on a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal microscope and
images were captured using Zeiss LSM 5 software (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging). For epifluorescence microscopy, cells were visualized through a
Nikon TE2000-E Eclipse fluorescence microscope and photographed with
an ORCA cooled charged-coupled device camera controlled by Openlab
software (Improvision, Inc.).
Migration and invasion assay. MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells were
treated with H2O or siRNA oligonucleotides for 48 h, as described above.
For migration toward 10% serum, the lower chamber of a modified
Boyden chamber (6.5 mm, 8.0-Am Transwell Costar membrane; Corning
Incorporated) was preincubated with 20% FBS in DMEM for 2 h. MDAMB-231 (2.5  104) or BT549 (1.2  104) cells were plated in the top
chamber in DMEM without serum and allowed to migrate toward 10%
serum for 6 h at 37jC. For migration toward EGF, cells were plated as
described above into chambers containing DMEM supplemented with 100
ng/mL EGF in the bottom chamber. For invasion, the top and bottom of
Biocoat invasion chambers (24-well, 8.0 Am, growth factor reduced
Matrigel matrix, BD Biosciences) were preincubated with serum-free
DMEM for 2 h. Cells were then plated as described above. Cells were

allowed to invade through the Matrigel for 24 h at 37jC. Following
migration or invasion, the nonmigratory cells were removed from the top
of the membrane with cotton swabs. The underside of the membrane was
fixed, stained using the Diff-Quik staining set (Dade Behring), and
mounted onto coverslips using Cytoseal-60 (Richard Allen Scientific). The
total number of migrated cells was determined by light microscopy.
Migration of cells cotransfected with plasmids encoding green fluorescent
protein (GFP) and vector or BCAR3 was measured by determining the
percentage of GFP-positive cells that migrated and dividing by the
transfection efficiency (12). The log values for each group of data were
analyzed by single-factor ANOVA. When significant differences were found
between groups at the 5% level, they were compared using the Student’s
t test assuming unequal variance.

Results
Endogenous BCAR3 is expressed and associated with
p130Cas in multiple breast cancer cell lines. BCAR3 mRNA has
been detected in various adult tissues and in a number of cancer
cell lines, including breast (4). Results to date, however, have not
addressed BCAR3 protein expression. Polyclonal antisera raised
against a peptide unique to BCAR3 were developed to measure
endogenous protein. This antisera specifically recognized FLAGtagged AND-34 (murine BCAR3), both by immunoprecipitation and
immunoblot (data not shown). BCAR3 expression was measured
using this antisera in a panel of breast cancer cell lines
representative of various stages of breast cancer progression. The
ER-positive cell lines MCF-7 and T47D represent noninvasive and
moderately invasive breast cancer, respectively, whereas the ERnegative breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-231 and BT549 are
models for more aggressive, metastatic disease (13). BCAR3 was
differentially expressed in these cell lines; MCF-7 and T47D cells
expressed very little BCAR3 whereas MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells
expressed moderate to high levels (Fig. 1A, bottom). p130Cas, which
is a binding partner of BCAR3, was also expressed at varying levels
in these cell lines (top). The relative intensity of the p130Cas-specific

Previous studies have shown that BCAR3 associates with p130Cas
in HEK293 cells and fibroblasts (5, 6, 8). To determine if BCAR3 and
p130Cas also formed a complex in breast cancer cells, endogenous
p130Cas was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates and the

and BCAR3 antibodies. BCAR3 was readily evident in immune
complexes isolated from MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells (Fig. 1B).

analysis, BCAR3 was expressed at low levels in MCF-7 and T47D
cells, whereas p130Cas expression was observed throughout the
cytoplasm and at the edges of the cells (Fig. 2A–F). In the more
aggressive cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT549), p130Cas and BCAR3
were colocalized both in the cytoplasm and at the cell periphery
(G–L, see arrowheads). Together, these data show that p130Cas and
BCAR3 colocalize and are associated with one another in invasive
MDA-MB-231 and BT549 breast cancer cell lines.
Overexpression of BCAR3 promotes migration and p130Cas
interactions in MCF-7 and T47D cells. Previous data from our
laboratory showed that co-overexpression of p130Cas and BCAR3
synergistically promoted the migration of fibroblasts (8). Likewise,

expression of the BCAR3 family member, Chat/SHEP1, also
increased migration in COS-7 cells (14). To investigate whether
BCAR3 expression influences the migratory potential of breast
cancer cells, BCAR3 was overexpressed in MCF-7 and T47D breast
cancer cells, which are relatively noninvasive and nonmotile.
Transfection of plasmids encoding BCAR3 resulted in significant
overexpression (Fig. 3A, bottom panels, compare lane 1 with 2 and
lane 5 with 6). This coincided with an f2-fold increase in migration
of both cell lines toward serum, as measured in Boyden chamber
assays (Fig. 3B). Increased proliferation of BCAR3-overexpressing
cells could not account for the differences in migration because
these cells exhibited no growth advantage over control cells (data

Figure 3. BCAR3 overexpression in MCF-7 and T47D cells increases BCAR3-p130Cas interactions and promotes cell migration. A, MCF-7 and T47D cells were
transiently transfected with vector (lanes 1, 3, 5 , and 7) or BCAR3-encoding plasmids (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 ). Twenty micrograms of total cell lysate (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6 )
or p130Cas immune complexes generated from 200 Ag of total protein (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8) were immunoblotted for p130Cas (top ) or BCAR3 (bottom ). B, MCF-7
and T47D cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding GFP plus vector or BCAR3. Twenty-four hours later, cells were seeded onto Boyden chambers and allowed
to migrate toward serum for 24 h at 37jC (see Materials and Methods for calculation of relative migratory index). Columns, mean for five or seven independent

colocalized with p130Cas at the periphery of the cell (arrowheads).

not shown). In both MCF-7 and T47D cells, BCAR3-p130Cas association was also increased under conditions of BCAR3 overexpression (Fig. 3A, compare lane 3 with 4 and lane 7 with 8).
In T47D cells, this increased association coincided with colocalization of BCAR3 with p130Cas at the cell periphery (Fig. 3C,
arrowheads). These data indicate that BCAR3 overexpression in
MCF-7 and T47D breast cancer cells can promote cell migration,
and that this may be due to increased BCAR3-p130Cas interactions
at the cell membrane.
Cell migration and invasion are inhibited by BCAR3 depletion.
To further investigate the role of BCAR3 in migration and invasion
of breast cancer cells, BCAR3 expression was reduced by BCAR3specific siRNA oligonucleotides in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells,
which are highly migratory and invasive. In both cell lines, BCAR3
expression was reduced by f90% (Fig. 4A, lanes 3 and 6) compared
with mock-transfected cells (lanes 1 and 4) or cells treated with
nontargeting control siRNA oligonucleotides (lanes 2 and 5).
To test if BCAR3 expression in MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells was
important for migration and invasion, siRNA-transfected cells were
analyzed for their ability to migrate toward serum or invade
through Matrigel. BCAR3 depletion was found to inhibit migration
of MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells by 50% and 65%, respectively
(Fig. 4B). Similarly, BCAR3 depletion inhibited invasion of MDAMB-231 and BT549 cells through Matrigel by 41% and 57%
(Fig. 4C). The differences in migration and invasion observed
between control and BCAR3-depeleted cells were not due to
decreases in cell viability, proliferation, spreading, or adherence
(data not shown). Furthermore, this inhibition of migration and
invasion was specifically due to the loss of BCAR3 expression
because reexpression of the nontargeted murine BCAR3 homologue, AND-34, in siRNA-treated BT549 cells resulted in rescue of
migration to levels seen in control cells (data not shown).
BCAR3 depletion in BT549 cells alters p130Cas localization. In
our previous work, the p130Cas-binding region of BCAR3 was found
to be necessary for the synergistic enhancement of migration caused
by co-overexpression of p130Cas and BCAR3. Enhanced migration
was coincident with p130Cas relocalization to the leading edge,
where BCAR3 was located (8). We hypothesized that BCAR3 depletion might have the opposite effect on p130Cas localization in breast
cancer cells, resulting in a diminution of p130Cas at membrane
ruffles coincident with the decrease in cell migration shown in Fig. 4.
To test this hypothesis, the localization of BCAR3 and p130Cas was
examined by immunofluorescence in BT549 cells treated with
control or BCAR3-specific siRNAs. As was the case for untreated
cells (Fig. 2J–L), BCAR3 and p130Cas colocalized at the periphery
in BT549 cells treated under control conditions (Fig. 5A–F, arrowheads). Cells treated with BCAR3-targeted siRNAs showed reduced
overall BCAR3 staining (G). Residual staining was confined
predominantly to the perinuclear region of the cell, where the
highest density of BCAR3 was observed in control cells (A and D).
The overall intensity of BCAR3 staining in these images is likely to
overestimate the amount of BCAR3 in the cell due to an attempt
to enhance the detection of low amounts of BCAR3 at the cell
periphery. Even under these staining conditions, however, BCAR3
was not evident at the cell periphery (G, see arrows). Coincidentally,
p130Cas was absent from these sites despite the fact that membrane
protrusions were still present (G–I, see arrows). These data raise
the possibility that depletion of p130Cas and BCAR3 from the membrane may contribute at least in part to reduced migration and
invasion independently of the ability of the cell to form membrane
protrusions.

and GAPDH (bottom panels ). B, vehicle-treated (black columns ), control

p130Cas localization to the membrane has been shown to correlate
with tyrosine phosphorylation (15). Phosphorylation of p130Cas is
increased upon EGF stimulation, which also results in transient
membrane ruffling (16). Because p130Cas was found to be largely
absent from peripheral membrane ruffles under conditions of BCAR3
depletion, we sought to determine if BT549 cells responded normally
to EGF stimulation under conditions of reduced BCAR3 expression.
Control and BCAR3 siRNA-treated BT549 cells were serum starved for
16 h and then stimulated with EGF for 1, 5, or 30 min to induce
membrane ruffles. Before EGF stimulation, p130Cas was located
throughout the cytoplasm in both control and BCAR3 siRNA-treated
cells, and actin was organized into stress fibers (Fig. 6A, a–c and m–o).
It is important to note that, unlike the cells shown in Fig. 2K, these
cells were serum starved and therefore had few membrane ruffles

under basal conditions. EGF stimulation resulted in a dissolution of
stress fibers and a relocalization of p130Cas to actin-rich membrane
ruffles in cells expressing endogenous levels of BCAR3 (d–l). This
response was observed as early as 1 min poststimulation and
persisted through 30 min. In contrast, BT549 cells with depleted
BCAR3 showed little morphologic change after EGF stimulation.
Prominent actin stress fibers were present throughout the 30-min
time course and membrane ruffles were rare (q, t, and w). Moreover,
p130Cas was not enriched at the edges of these cells after EGF
stimulation (p, s, and v).
Interactions between p130Cas and the adapter molecule Crk have
been reported to regulate EGF-dependent cell migration (17). To
assess whether the attenuated EGF responses observed under
conditions of depleted BCAR3 expression were associated with
altered migration toward EGF, siRNA-treated BT549 cells were
serum starved for 16 h and then plated in Boyden chambers
containing 100 ng/mL EGF in the bottom chamber. BCAR3 depletion
inhibited migration toward EGF by 67% compared with control cells
(Fig. 6B). This decrease in migration coincided with a concomitant
decrease in basal and EGF-dependent p130Cas phosphorylation (Fig.
6C, top, compare lanes 5–8 with lanes 1–4) and loss of p130Cas/Crk
interactions (third panel). Together, these results show that BCAR3
serves as a regulator of EGF-stimulated membrane ruffling, p130Cas
localization to the ruffles, promotion of p130Cas/Crk interactions,
and migration.

Discussion
Tamoxifen resistance is associated with a poor clinical prognosis,
frequently occurring in patients with metastatic disease (18).
Overexpression of BCAR3 has been shown to promote resistance to
tamoxifen in vitro, and studies using rat embryo fibroblasts have
shown that BCAR3 can function as a regulator of cell migration
(4, 8). Previous studies have characterized the structural components of BCAR3 necessary for promotion of tamoxifen resistance,
migration, and interaction with p130Cas (5, 7, 8). The aim of this

study was to investigate the functional interactions between
BCAR3 and p130Cas that regulate breast cancer cell migration
and invasion. Based on our findings, we propose that BCAR3
functions in breast cancer cells to translocate p130Cas from the
cytoplasm to the cell membrane, where it can become phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of p130Cas then stimulates interactions with
SH2 domain–containing proteins such as Crk, leading to the
formation of signaling complexes at the cell membrane that
promote cell migration and invasion.
Support for this model comes from three lines of evidence. First,
BCAR3/p130Cas complexes were readily detected in two invasive
breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and BT549 cells), whereas
less invasive cell lines exhibited greatly reduced BCAR3/p130Cas
interactions (T47D and MCF-7 cells; Fig. 1). Moreover, both
molecules colocalized at the cell periphery in MDA-MB-231 and
BT549 cells cultured in the presence of serum, whereas BCAR3 was
not detected at these sites in the less migratory T47D cells (Fig. 2).
Second, overexpression of BCAR3 in MCF-7 and T47D cells
enhanced cell migration concomitant with an increase in
BCAR3/p130Cas complexes and the appearance of BCAR3 in
p130Cas-enriched sites at the cell periphery in T47D cells (Fig. 3).
Third, knockdown of BCAR3 expression in MDA-MB-231 and
BT549 cells reduced cell migration and invasion toward serum
(Fig. 4). Reduced BCAR3 expression in BT549 cells also caused a
decrease in migration toward EGF, coincident with a loss of p130Cas
from EGF-induced membrane ruffles and a reduction in p130Cas/
Crk complexes (Fig. 6). Together, these data suggest that both the
spatial and temporal regulation of BCAR3/p130Cas interactions
within the cell may be critical for controlling cell motility.
p130Cas has been shown to play a key role in the migration of
several cell types through its function as a scaffolding molecule
(19, 20). However, a role for p130Cas in breast cancer cell migration
and invasion has not been established, despite the fact that p130Cas
is frequently expressed at high levels in both breast cancer cell lines
and tumors (Fig. 1; refs. 21, 22). Tyrosine phosphorylation of

Figure 6. Depletion of BCAR3 in BT549 cells results in an attenuated EGF response. A, BT549 cells were transfected with control or BCAR3-specific siRNAs and
incubated for 48 h. Cells were then serum starved for 16 h and stimulated with 100 ng/mL of EGF for 0, 1, 5, or 30 min. p130Cas localization was visualized by
epifluorescence with p130Cas antibodies (green ) and filamentous actin was visualized by Texas red–phalloidin (red). Merged images are shown. B, control siRNA or
BCAR3 siRNA-treated BT549 cells were seeded onto Boyden chambers 48 h posttransfection and allowed to migrate toward 100 ng/mL EGF for 6 h. *, P < 0.05 relative
to control siRNA treatment of cells. C, BT549 cells were siRNA treated and stimulated with EGF as described in (A ). p130Cas immune complexes were generated from
200 Ag total cell lysates, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with pTyr (top ) or p130Cas (second panel ) antibodies. Crk immune complexes were
generated from 650 Ag total cell lysates, separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with p130Cas (third panel ) and Crk (bottom ) antibodies.

p130Cas, which is mediated predominantly by Src family kinases
(23), plays a critical role in its function as a regulator of cell
migration. Phosphorylated forms of p130Cas preferentially localize
to the membrane as well as nascent and mature focal complexes
(15, 24). p130Cas also localizes to membrane ruffles in migrating
COS cells but not in nonmigrating cells (17). Although membrane
targeting of p130Cas seems to be important, the mechanism by
which p130Cas is translocated to the membrane has not been
established. Our results suggest that BCAR3 may be a key mediator
of this localization. Interestingly, previous results showed that, in
fibroblasts, BCAR3 and p130Cas colocalization at the membrane
was not dependent on their direct association. It remains to be
determined whether this is also the case in breast cancer cells.
These studies are currently under way.

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (13). July 1, 2007

Phosphorylation of the substrate-binding domain of p130Cas can
result in the generation of multiple binding sites for the small adapter
molecule Crk (17). p130Cas/Crk coupling figures prominently in the
process of migration of numerous cell types, including pancreatic and
prostate cancer cells (25–28). We show in this report that BCAR3
expression regulates EGF-dependent p130Cas phosphorylation and
association with Crk in BT549 breast cancer cells. Overexpression of
membrane-targeted Chat/SHEP1 in COS cells was also found to
increase p130Cas phosphorylation and p130Cas/Crk association, and
inhibition of these interactions dissipated membrane ruffles (14).
Nonetheless, there are cases where p130Cas/Crk interactions can be
uncoupled from p130Cas phosphorylation (29). It is interesting to note
that BCAR3 has recently been reported to associate with Crk in
glomerular mesangial cells of the kidney, although it remains to be

BCAR3 Regulates Cell Migration and p130Cas Localization

determined whether this interaction is direct or has an effect on cell
motility (30).
Several lines of evidence point to a role for BCAR3 in regulating
actin cytoskeletal structures involved in cell migration. Both our
group and others have shown that fibroblasts engineered to overexpress BCAR3 exhibit increases in membrane ruffles, decreases in
actin stress fibers, and adoption of a polarized phenotype marked
by classic leading and trailing edges (6, 8). We found in this study
that reduction of BCAR3 in BT549 cells had the reverse effect,
characterized by diminished EGF-dependent membrane ruffling
and a failure to undergo dissolution of stress fibers after EGF stimulation. Other NSP proteins seem to play similar roles in actin
regulation. For example, Chat/SHEP1 has been reported to colocalize with p130Cas in actin-rich membrane ruffles in COS-7 cells (9).
Moreover, expression of a myristoylated form of this molecule that
was constitutively localized to the plasma membrane increased
membrane ruffling, cell spreading, and adhesion of NIH3T3 cells
through a p130Cas-dependent process (14, 31).
Small GTPases are key regulators of actin dynamics. Interestingly,
BCAR3 has been shown to increase the activation state of several
small GTPases, including Rac1, Cdc42, R-Ras, RalA, and Rap1 (5–7).
Although the carboxyl terminus of BCAR3 has limited homology to
the GEF domain of Cdc25, it remains to be determined whether this
molecule has intrinsic GEF activity. It is likely, however, that BCAR3
activates several of these GTPases indirectly through other GEFs (32).
Based on our findings, we suggest that this may occur at least in part
through p130Cas and its binding partner Crk, which can bind to
DOCK180 and C3G to activate Rac1 and Rap1, respectively (33). In
fibroblasts, Rap1 has been shown to play an important role in the
promotion of migration by BCAR3 and signals downstream of
p130Cas/Crk binding were shown to be partly responsible for Chatinduced migration (8, 31). BCAR3 may also activate these GTPases
independently of p130Cas, thus contributing to the defects in actin
reorganization and cell motility observed under conditions of BCAR3
depletion in response to EGF (Fig. 6).
Although our data support a function for BCAR3 in translocating
p130Cas from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane, we do not
yet know the mechanism by which BCAR3 is targeted to the
membrane, nor do we know whether this is a regulated event. In
fibroblasts, membrane localization of BCAR3 could be uncoupled
from the promotion of migration because a mutant lacking the
carboxyl terminus was still targeted to the membrane but did not
induce migration (8). Interestingly, BCAR3 mutants containing a
substitution of the conserved arginine residue present in the SH2
domain (R171V) were not targeted to the membrane in REF-52
fibroblasts,3 suggesting that the SH2 domain may play a role in
BCAR3 localization. Activated Eph receptors can bind to the SH2

domain of Chat/SHEP1 and the EGFR has been reported to bind to
NSP1 (14, 34). Based on these data, it is reasonable to hypothesize
that BCAR3 membrane localization may occur through binding to
tyrosine phosphorylated receptors. However, we were unable to
detect BCAR3/EGFR interactions in BT549 cells after EGF
stimulation (data not shown).
The initial discovery of BCAR3 as a gene capable of inducing
tamoxifen resistance fits well with its emerging role as a modulator
of breast cancer cell migration. Tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer
cell lines have been shown to exhibit increased motility and
invasiveness (1). Several recent studies of BCAR3-mediated resistance to antiestrogens have implicated promigratory pathways.
Yu and Feig (10) showed that overexpression of constitutively active
R-Ras, but not Ral or Rap1, conferred estrogen independence in
MCF-7 cells through signaling to PI3K and AKT. Independently,
constitutively active R-Ras has been shown to promote migration
of T47D cells, increase focal adhesion complexes in a p130Casdependent manner, and, most recently, contribute to signaling crosstalk between estrogen and insulin in breast cancer cells (35–37).
Others have shown that overexpression of full length BCAR3, but
not variants lacking the SH2 or carboxy terminal domain, allowed
growth of ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells in the presence of ICI 182,780
in a process that was dependent on PI3K-mediated Rac1 activation
(6, 7). Rac1 activation, which is important for lamellipodia and
membrane ruffle formation, is often coupled to p130Cas/Crk
interactions (17). p130Cas/Crk–dependent Rac1 activation has also
been shown to be a potent activator of c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
(38), which can promote cell proliferation and migration (39, 40).
Finally, we have shown that phosphorylated p130Cas can bind to the
p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K, resulting in enhanced PI3K activity
and cell proliferation (41). Numerous studies have shown that PI3K
has dual functions as a regulator of both proliferation and cell
motility, raising the possibility that p130Cas/PI3K interactions may
also contribute to BCAR3-dependent regulation of cell migration
(42–44). Collectively, our data suggest that, like PI3K, BCAR3 and
p130Cas may have dual functions involving both the promotion of
antiestrogen-resistant proliferation as well as increased cell
migration. Future studies will explore these functions further in
tissue culture, mouse models of tumor growth and metastasis, and in
human tumors.
