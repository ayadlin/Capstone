BACKGROUND: Cancer patients admitted to a palliative care unit generally have a poor prognosis. The role of antineoplastic therapy (ANT) in these patients remains controversial. In the current study, the authors examined the frequency and predictors associated with ANT use in hospitalized patients who required admission to an acute
palliative care unit (APCU). METHODS: Included in the study were all 2604 patients admitted over a 5-year period to
a 12-bed APCU located within a National Cancer Institute comprehensive cancer center, in which patients had access
to both palliative care and ANT. Institutional databases were used to retrospectively retrieve data regarding patient
demographics, cancer diagnosis, ANT use, length of hospital stay, and survival from time of admission. RESULTS: The
median hospital stay was 11 days, and the median survival was 22 days. During hospitalization, 435 patients (17%)
received ANT, including chemotherapy (N ¼ 297; 11%), hormonal agents (N ¼ 54; 2%), and targeted therapy (N ¼ 155;
6%). No significant change in the frequency of ANT use was detected over the 5-year period. Multivariate logistic
regression analysis revealed that younger age, specific cancer diagnoses, and longer admissions were independently
associated with ANT use. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ANT during hospitalization that included an APCU stay was limited to a small percentage of patients and did not increase over time. ANT use was associated with younger age, specific cancer diagnoses, and longer admissions. The APCU facilitates simultaneous care for patients receiving ANT.

Patients with advanced cancer inevitably experience progressive functional decline and psychological distress. As

patients transition from advanced to far advanced stages of disease (ie, expected survival of <3 months), palliative care
plays an increasingly important role by providing symptom control and psychosocial counseling, and facilitating healthcare decision making. Patients who require admission under palliative care generally have a poor prognosis, with a median
survival of weeks.1-5 During this critical end-of-life period, patients, family members, and the healthcare team are faced
with a multitude of complex healthcare decisions.
Some of the most challenging of these complex decisions concern the initiation, continuation, and withdrawal of
palliative antineoplastic therapy (ANT).6 Because of a lack of clear guidance for the use of ANT at the end-of-life and the
difficulty in estimating survival for patients with advanced cancer, the decision to administer or withhold ANT is currently
being made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account patients’ wishes along with clinical, logistic, and financial
considerations.7

Antineoplastic Agents in Palliative Care/Hui et al

The role of ANT for patients admitted to the acute
palliative care unit (APCU) is controversial. Some institutions have a policy of discontinuing all ANT on admission
to the APCU, which forces patients to choose between
cancer treatment and optimal palliative care. Others propose a simultaneous care model in which patients receive
palliative care while receiving ANT.8-10 Lagman et al
described their experience with cancer patients admitted
to an inpatient palliative care unit at the Cleveland Clinic,
in which 13% were treated with radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or both.11 Another retrospective study from a
Japanese Cancer Center reported only 3 of 201 patients
admitted to its palliative care unit received
chemotherapy.12
To the best of our knowledge, there has been little
documentation of the extent, trends, and predictors of
ANT use in patients who require an APCU stay. A better
understanding of the current pattern of ANT use would
provide insights into how palliative care can be integrated
into oncology practice under a simultaneous care model.
Using a retrospective cohort design, we examined the frequency, factors, and duration between admission and
death associated with ANT use in hospitalized patients
who required an APCU stay.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
The Institutional Review Board at The University of
Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC)
approved this study and waived informed consent. All
cancer patients admitted to the APCU at MDACC
between September 1, 2003 and August 31, 2008 were
included in this retrospective cohort study. These dates
were chosen to correspond to the institution’s fiscal year,
which begins on September 1 and ends on August 31 of
the following year. For patients with multiple admissions
to the APCU, only the last available admission was
included for analysis because this admission is closest to
the end-of-life, providing insights into the extent of ANT
use in patients with far advanced cancer.
Our 12-bed APCU was opened at the MDACC in
2002. Staffed by an interdisciplinary team of physicians,
nurses, social workers, physiotherapists, and a chaplain, 1
goal of the APCU is to provide symptom management for
patients with advanced cancer and severe physical and/or
psychosocial distress, and to provide emotional support
for their families.13

Patient Characteristics and Duration Between
Admission and Death
We retrospectively retrieved patient demographics (age,
sex, race, and religion), cancer diagnosis, and durations of
the entire hospitalization and APCU stays from institutional databases. We also collected information regarding
ANT used between the dates of hospital admission and
discharge from our institutional pharmacy databases. To
ensure consistency and accuracy of data, we conducted
further reviews of patient electronic health records when
any discrepancy was detected. Survival outcome was
obtained from the Tumor Registry Vital Statistics Database, with further review of electronic chart records to
obtain the date of last follow-up when necessary.
We examined ANTs use during the entire hospitalization period, rather than the APCU period alone,
because the periods leading to APCU admission and immediately after APCU discharge were very much related
to the APCU stay, with similar patient characteristics and
disease severity. Among patients with multiple cancer
diagnoses, the most responsible cancer diagnosis for hospitalization was used for analysis.
ANT Use
Decisions to initiate, continue, or withdraw ANT were
made on a case-by-case basis, with key guidance provided
by the patients’ oncologists. Patients admitted to our
APCU are able to receive ANT; however, our nurses are
not certified to administer cytotoxic or targeted therapies
intravenously. Thus, arrangements are made to facilitate
the administration of parenteral ANT, such as temporary
transfer to the outpatient chemotherapy unit or to an oncology inpatient unit.
ANTs were categorized into chemotherapeutic
agents, hormonal agents, and targeted therapy. In this
study, biologic agents such as interferon were classified as
targeted therapy.
Megestrol acetate may be used either as anticancer
therapy or as therapy for anorexia-cachexia. Thus, for
patients who received this medication, we reviewed the
indications to determine whether it had been used as
ANT. Bisphosphonates and corticosteroids were not
considered ANT in this study.
Statistical Analysis
We summarized baseline demographics, admission characteristics, and ANT utilization using descriptive statistics, including medians, means, standard deviations,
ranges, and frequencies together with 95% confidence

intervals. The chi-square test was used to determine the
yearly trend of ANT utilization.
We compared the baseline and admission characteristics between patients who received ANT and those who
did not. Comparisons were made using the Student t test
for continuous variables that were normally distributed
(ie, age); the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous, nonparametric variables (eg, admission length); and the Pearson
chi-square test for categorical variables (eg, race, religion).
Variables associated with a P value .20 on univariate
analysis were then fitted in a logistic regression model
with backward elimination to identify factors associated
with ANT during hospitalization. A 2-sided P value <.05
was considered to be statistically significant.
Survival analysis was plotted by using the KaplanMeier method.14 Overall survival was calculated from the
time of hospital admission to death from any cause or
date last known alive.
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS
version 16.0; SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill) software was used
for statistical analysis.

Baseline Characteristics
The characteristics of the 2604 patients who required
admission to the APCU during the study period are
shown in Table 1. Respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary malignancies constituted greater than half of all
cases. A total of 740 (28%) patients were admitted to and
discharged directly from the APCU; the remainder had
both an oncology unit and APCU stay. The median duration between admission and death for the entire cohort
was 22 days.
Frequency of ANT Use
During their hospitalization that included an APCU stay,
435 patients received ANT, including chemotherapy (N
¼ 297; 11%), hormonal agents (N ¼ 54; 2%), and targeted therapy (N ¼ 155; 6%). Among these patients, 58
received both chemotherapeutic agents and targeted
agents, 11 received both chemotherapeutic agents and
hormonal agents, and 1 received all 3 classes of agents.
Thirty-six patients (1%) received ANT as part of an
experimental clinical trial. Overall, 2169 (83%) patients
received no ANT during the APCU admission.
The median number of ANT administered during
the entire hospitalization was 1 (interquartile range [Q1Q3], 1-2), with a median number of 2 doses (Q1-Q3, 1-

7), trastuzumab (N ¼ 6), imatinib (N ¼ 4), and sunitinib
(N ¼ 4).
During their APCU stay, 82 (3%), 35 (1%), and 58
(2%), respectively, patients received chemotherapy, hormonal agents, and targeted therapy. A total of 382 (15%)
patients had ANT initiated while they were admitted
under an oncology service, and 53 (2%) received their first
dose after transfer to the APCU. Among the patients who
were treated with chemotherapeutic, hormonal, and targeted agents during hospitalization, 10%, 26%, and 12%,
respectively, received the ANT after they were transferred
to the APCU.
Yearly Trends of ANT Use
The frequency of ANT use during the entire hospitalization over the 5-year period is shown in Figure 1. Overall,
no significant variation in the frequency of use was noted
for chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted agents.
We also examined the yearly trend of ANT use during
APCU admission and found no significant changes over
time (data not shown).
Factors Associated With ANT Use
Table 2 highlights the factors associated with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and targeted therapy use by univariate analysis, and Table 3 lists variables that were found
to be significant on multivariate logistic regression analysis. Factors associated with chemotherapy use included
younger age, longer hospital stay, shorter APCU stay, and
admissions that included an oncology unit stay in addition to the APCU stay. Patients with hematologic (37%),
dermatologic (18%), genitourinary (15%), primary
unknown (14%), and breast (13%) malignancies were

also more likely than were patients with other cancer diagnoses to receive chemotherapeutic agents during their last
hospital admission that included an APCU stay. All of
these factors remained significant on multivariate analysis.
Hormonal agent use was found to be associated with
specific cancer diagnoses (breast, 10%; gynecologic, 5%;
and genitourinary, 3%) and longer hospital stays on multivariate analysis.
On univariate analysis, the use of targeted therapy
was more common with younger age, White and Hispanic
race, longer hospital stay, shorter APCU stay, and admissions that included an oncology ward stay in addition to
an APCU stay. Cancer diagnoses found to be associated
with targeted therapy use included hematologic (17%),
primary unknown (14%), dermatologic (8%), and respiratory (7%). On multivariate logistic regression analysis,
age, cancer diagnosis, length of hospital admission, and
length of APCU admission were found to be independently associated with the use of targeted agents.

DISCUSSION
The results of the current study indicate that the vast majority of patients who required admission to the APCU at
MDACC did not receive ANT, and that the frequency of
ANT did not increase over time. ANT use was associated
with younger age, specific cancer diagnoses, and longer
hospital stays.
The current study provides a comprehensive examination of the extent of chemotherapeutic, hormonal, and
targeted agent use in patients with far advanced cancer
who required admission to an APCU. Among 435 (17%)
patients for whom ANT was prescribed, 70% received cytotoxic agents. The frequency of chemotherapy use in the
study institution is consistent with findings from a recent
report from another comprehensive cancer center.11 We
did not detect an increase in ANT use over the 5-year period. One explanation is that ANT use may have reached
a plateau among patients with advanced refractory cancer,
limited by patients’ performance status, cost of therapy,
and the slow US Food and Drug Administration approval
process for many novel agents.
Patients admitted to our APCU were more likely to
receive ANT than were those admitted to hospices across
the United States.15 First, our APCU is situated within a
comprehensive cancer center that offers a full array of
novel cancer therapies and clinical trials. Second, our
patients tend to be young and highly motivated, with a
good performance status and high socioeconomic status

malignancies were associated with hormonal therapy use
in our cohort.
The overall length of hospital stay increased with
ANT use, which could be explained by the extra time
needed for treatment administration and for patients to
recover from therapy. The administration of ANT was
also associated with a shorter stay in the APCU; thus,
patients who received ANT spent a proportionally larger
amount of time in the oncology ward. It is interesting to
note that neither race nor religion was a key consideration
in the frequency of ANT use.
Both the American Society of Clinical Oncology19-21
and the National Quality Forum22 have stated that
chemotherapy use within 14 days of death is an indicator
of poor end-of-life care. Only 5.5% of patients in the current study cohort met this criterion. Although the principle
of minimizing aggressive therapies in dying patients is
fundamentally sound, survival estimation is extremely difficult, with to our knowledge no standard prognostic tools
available for advanced cancer patients.23-26 More research
is necessary to establish predictors of survival in this population. Until highly accurate prognostic models such as the
Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation
(APACHE) Score27 in the critical care setting become
available for advanced cancer patients, the application of

cator of quality of care is challenging. Other reasons for
the administration of ANT close to the end-of-life include
heightened expectations and the hope of prolonging life
and symptom control.7,28-35 Some patients may have a
narrow window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention, and a trial of ANT may appear to be reasonable.
Another reason is the increasing availability of new ANT
over the past decade. Many of these agents are associated
with fewer adverse effects than older agents, making it possible for patients to receive ANT later in the trajectory of
illness.
One of the problems with chemotherapy administration close to the end-of-life is that it poses a barrier for
patients with far advanced cancer to receive palliative care
and hospice services, because they frequently have to ‘‘give
up’’ ANT before enrollment onto these programs.36 In
the current series, all patients who received chemotherapy
had access to both palliative care and oncology teams,
highlighting a key advantage of an integrated palliative
care program. Indeed, a strong integration of palliative
care into oncology practice under the simultaneous care
model may enhance the care of advanced cancer patients
who require ANT.10,37 First, optimal symptom management would support patients through treatments, and
help maintain their quality of life. Second, the simultaneous model would allow palliative care to be introduced

earlier in the patientapos;s disease trajectory, and in the
process significantly increase its effectiveness through
timely symptom control, psychosocial interventions, and
transition of care. This is in contrast to the traditional
dichotomized model of active treatment and palliative
care/hospice, which results in fragmented care, delayed
palliative care referrals, the need to sacrifice quality of life
for potential gain in quantity of life, and significant
emotional distress.34
The current study had several limitations. First, this
study was only able to examine treatments given during
hospital admissions that included an APCU stay. Due to
the short survival in the current study cohort, we believe
the likelihood of ANT use after APCU discharge is minimal. However, further studies are required to address
ANT use before and after admission. Second, several
potential determinants of ANT, such as education level,
socioeconomic status, cancer stage, location of metastases,
symptom profile, and performance status were not available. Indeed, universal documentation of symptoms and
performance status during the APCU admission would
help to assess the potential impact of palliative care on
physical and psychosocial distress at the end of life.
Finally, patients who are treated at our comprehensive
cancer center and the treatments that they received may
not be representative of cancer patients and treatments
throughout the United States; thus, the results may not be
generalizable.
In summary, our APCU served patients with
advanced cancer who had unique clinical characteristics
and treatment needs, and facilitated simultaneous care. In
the era of personalized medicine, we need to develop not
only novel therapeutics targeting specific mutations
within the cancer, but also symptom management strategies and psychosocial interventions tailored to our
patients’ needs and their disease trajectory. Identification
of clinical and pathologic markers to better predict clinical
benefits and adverse effects associated with ANT, coupled
with improved prognostication skills and treatment-decision tools, would allow us to better customize therapeutic
decisions. The further integration of palliative care into
the practice of oncology under a simultaneous care model
will improve patient access to palliative care, and hopefully improve their quality of life.
