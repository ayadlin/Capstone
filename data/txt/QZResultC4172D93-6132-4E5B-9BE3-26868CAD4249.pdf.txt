ABSTRACT
Phosphodiesterase 4D7 was recently shown to be specifically over-expressed in
localized prostate cancer, raising the question as to which regulatory mechanisms
are involved and whether other isoforms of this gene family (PDE4D) are affected
under the same conditions.
We investigated PDE4D isoform composition in prostatic tissues using a total of
seven independent expression datasets and also included data on DNA methylation,
copy number and AR and ERG binding in PDE4D promoters to gain insight into their
effect on PDE4D transcription.
We show that expression of PDE4D isoforms is consistently altered in primary
human prostate cancer compared to benign tissue, with PDE4D7 being up-regulated
while PDE4D5 and PDE4D9 are down-regulated. Disease progression is marked by an
overall down-regulation of long PDE4D isoforms, while short isoforms (PDE4D1/2)
appear to be relatively unaffected. While these alterations seem to be independent
of copy number alterations in the PDE4D locus and driven by AR and ERG binding,
we also observed increased DNA methylation in the promoter region of PDE4D5,
indicating a long lasting alteration of the isoform composition in prostate cancer
tissues.
We propose two independent metrics that may serve as diagnostic and prognostic
markers for prostate disease: (PDE4D7 - PDE4D5) provides an effective means for
distinguishing PCa from normal adjacent prostate, whereas PDE4D1/2 - (PDE4D5 +
PDE4D7 + PDE4D9) offers strong prognostic potential to detect aggressive forms of
PCa and is associated with metastasis free survival. Overall, our findings highlight the
relevance of PDE4D as prostate cancer biomarker and potential drug target.

current routine of diagnosing PCa results in a significant
number of unnecessary biopsies and treatments of noncancerous, benign prostate conditions and non-aggressive
cancers, leading to severe negative effects for both men
and healthcare systems [2, 3].

INTRODUCTION
With an estimated 417,000 new cases in 2014 in
Europe, prostate cancer (PCa) remains the most often
diagnosed gender-specific carcinoma for men [1]. The

Next to well-studied pathways such as androgen
receptor (AR) and PI3K/AKT, cyclic AMP (cAMP)
has been shown to play a role in the development and
progression of PCa [4]. The metabolism of cAMP in
cells is complex and tailored by spatial and signalling
cross-talk considerations involving both a large family
of adenylyl cyclases responsible for its synthesis, and
a large family of cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases
(PDEs) responsible for its degradation [5]. It is now
well recognized that when particular cAMP degrading
PDEs are recruited to specific signalling complexes
they create and control cAMP gradients around them,
allowing spatially compartmentalised and time-dependent
regulation of localized cAMP signalling [6, 7]. Protein
domains involved in subcellular localization as well as
independent regulatory mechanisms play a pivotal role in
these processes, granting PDE isoforms the ability to fulfil
functionally independent and unique roles in the cell [6, 8].
Thus, changes in the expression of distinct PDE isoforms
can be expected to reprogram downstream signalling
pathways during disease development and progression,
providing potential targets for novel markers and
therapeutic interventions [6]. Indeed, cAMP-degrading
PDEs have been associated with several diseases in recent
years, including stroke, acrodysostosis and COPD [9–
14], and more recently, expression of a specific PDE4D
isoform (PDE4D7) has been related to prostate cancer [15,
16].
The PDE4D7 transcript comprises the open reading
frame for a long PDE4D isoform that contains both the
UCR1 and UCR2 regulatory domains [17]. These protein
domains are common to all long PDE4D isoforms with
UCR1 being phosphorylated by PKA (cAMP dependent
protein kinase A), when cAMP levels within the cell are
elevated, leading to enzyme activation [18, 19]. Indeed,
activation of long PDE4 isoforms, such as PDE4D7,
by PKA provides a fundamental part of the cellular
desensitization process to cAMP [6]. Long PDE4 isoforms
can also be dynamically regulated through phosphorylation
by other key signalling system kinases, namely, by ERK
[20], MK2 [21], Cdk5 [22] and AMPK [23]. Additionally,
PDE4D7 has been shown [15] to be specifically targeted to
the sub-plasma membrane compartment in prostate cancer
cells where it regulates local cAMP levels that are linked
to cell proliferation [15].
We have previously shown that PDE4D7 is
specifically overexpressed in both androgen sensitive
PCa cells and in samples from patients with early
androgen sensitive prostate disease [15, 16]. However, in
marked contrast to this, once PCa cells become androgen
insensitive/independent (castration resistant), expression
of PDE4D7 declines [15, 16].
Here, we show that PDE4D isoform composition is
altered in localized prostate cancer and that it can be used
both as a diagnostic as well as a prognostic biomarker. In
conjunction with our previous studies, we see that the long
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

transcript isoform PDE4D7 is up-regulated in localized
disease compared to normal adjacent prostate (NAP),
while its expression diminishes with tumour progression.
In contrast to PDE4D7, two other long isoforms, PDE4D5
and PDE4D9, do not undergo an initial up-regulation in
primary PCa and instead are increasingly down-regulated
during disease progression. Moreover, we suggest that this
change in isoform composition may be influenced by the
DNA methylation of specific regulatory elements of the
PDE4D locus. These findings highlight the potential of
using condition-specific mRNA isoforms of the PDE4D
gene as biomarkers and potential novel therapy targets to
restore benign conditions.

RESULTS
The long isoforms PDE4D5 and PDE4D9 are
significantly down-regulated in primary prostate
cancer, independent of copy number alterations
in the PDE4D gene locus
After previously identifying PDE4D7 as a novel
biomarker candidate [16], we wanted to investigate the
behaviour of other PDE4D transcript isoforms in PCa
development and progression. Therefore, we focused
on the nine major human PDE4D isoforms described in
RefSeq and conducted a meta-analysis of six publicly
available patient cohorts. Our analysis revealed that
many PDE4D isoforms are seemingly expressed at stable
levels when using Exon Arrays, whereas only PDE4D1/2,
PDE4D5, PDE4D7, and PDE4D9 were detectable at
higher levels in our independent qRT-PCR cohort of
prostate tissues (see Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures
S1-S5). These findings were supported by the TCGA
PRAD RNA-seq cohort, which mostly agreed with
RT-PCR results, despite few outlier samples showing
expression of other isoforms (Supplementary Figure
S6). Based on these findings, we focused on the above
mentioned PDE4D isoforms, as they showed consistent
expression profiles in all used cohorts. Using these criteria,
we found that both PDE4D5 and PDE4D9 are significantly
down-regulated in primary localized PCa when compared
to benign samples. Moreover, patient samples derived
from castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) showed
further down-regulation of both isoforms, in line with
our previous findings for PDE4D7 [16]. Likewise, PCa
metastasis samples followed this trend, but often displayed
higher variance in PDE4D isoform expression, as can
be expected given their very heterogeneous genomic
background [24].
Since, partial or complete deletions of one or both
alleles of the PDE4D gene have been reported previously
in prostate cancer [25–27] we utilized TCGA SNP array
data of matching patient samples to assess the potential
impact of deletions occurring in PDE4D on isoform
expression. Although we did observe a significant

both isoforms were also expressed at significantly lower
levels in PCa samples which did not harbour a deletion
when comparing to matching normal samples (Figure 2).

and PDE4D9 in prostate disease. In order to do this, we
assigned localized PCa samples to one of two groups
based on an unsupervised clustering of ERG expression
values by Partitioning Around Medoids and used available
ERG IHC information of the EMC cohort to confirm
the validity of this approach. Clustering based grouping
showed good concordance with IHC results, assigning
four additional samples (10.2%) to the ERG positive
group (Supplementary Figure S7).
Interestingly, while we were able to confirm
PDE4D7 overexpression in ERG positive PCa samples,
PDE4D1/2 and PDE4D9 seemed unaffected by ERG,
whereas PDE4D5 expression was altered significantly in

Androgen receptor and ERG are implicated in
transcriptional regulation of PDE4D
Our previous work suggested an association
between PDE4D7 expression and the presence of the
TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene [16]. We therefore set out
to investigate whether there was any comparable ERG
involvement in the expression of PDE4D5, PDE4D7

two out of five datasets, suggesting that any connection
between PDE4D5 and ERG is weak at best (see
Figure 3). Of note, the Erho dataset consistently showed
significant changes for all isoforms, however, these likely
do not reflect real events, as absolute log2 fold changes
were small (|log2FC| < 1) except for PDE4D7 (data not
shown). Therefore, ERG linkage discriminates between
PDE4D7 and the grouping of PDE4D1/2, PDE4D5 and
PDE4D9, where we see differences between these two
groups in the change of their expression in prostate
disease.

To investigate androgen-dependence of PDE4D
isoform expression, we incorporated a public dataset of
LNCaP cells measured after being kept either in androgen
stripped medium (using dextran-coated charcoal - DCC)
or after addition of the synthetic androgen R1881 [28].
While PDE4D9 expression was not altered after treatment,
both PDE4D5 and PDE4D7 showed significant differences
in expression after R1881 addition (Figure 4). Specifically,
PDE4D5 expression appeared to be inhibited upon AR
stimulation, while PDE4D7 was up-regulated in DCC by
the synthetic androgen R1881 in LNCaP cells.

are compared to PCa samples with (n=12) and without (n=171) loss of genetic material in the PDE4D locus to investigate whether decreased
expression occurs independently of PDE4D deletions. Significant differences in expression are denoted with * (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon-MannWhitney test).

Next, we made use of public ChIP-seq data from
the VCaP PCa cell line [29] treated with R1881 in
order to gather further evidence of AR involvement in
PDE4D expression. In ChIP-seq, DNA binding proteins
and associated chromatin are cross-linked, followed
by immunoprecipitation of a protein of interest and
subsequent sequencing of the associated DNA fragments,
allowing a genome-wide localisation of its DNA binding
sites. Overall, we found 31 ChIP-seq peaks for AR in
PDE4D, two of which were near the first exon of PDE4D7
(~2 kb and 3 kb upstream), while another was partially

overlapping the first exon of PDE4D5 (see Supplementary
Table S1). No peaks could be found in proximity to the
PDE4D9 transcription start site (TSS), as the closest
upstream and downstream peaks were found at an
approximate distance of 85.5 kb and 44.2 kb, respectively.
Since VCaP harbours the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion
and ChIP-seq data for ERG was available from the same
source, we included it in our analysis and found 43 ERG
peaks in the PDE4D gene locus, of which some were
found to partially overlap the first exon of each of the long
isoforms PDE4D5, PDE4D7 and PDE4D9 (see Figure 5

Figure 3: Investigating potential ERG regulation of PDE4D isoforms. Since only PDE4D7 has been previously reported as upregulated in ERG positive PCa samples [16], expression of PDE4D1/2, PDE4D5, PDE4D7 and PDE4D9 was tested in ERG negative and
ERG positive samples across five Exon Array datasets (* = p < 0.05, ** = p < 0.001, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test).

and Supplementary Table S2). Since the number of ChIPseq peaks located in PDE4D appears to be rather high,
we were wondering whether binding of AR and/or ERG
within the gene locus occurs more often as compared to
other regions. For this reason, we counted the number of
AR and ERG peaks in 21,209 RefSeq gene loci and used
these counts to construct empirical cumulative distribution
functions (ECDFs) for both transcription factors. These
ECDFs model the background distribution of the counts
for both AR and ERG across all genes and enable us to
calculate in which percentile the peak counts for AR and
ERG in PDE4D are falling. Surprisingly, both AR and

ERG were among the top 99.9% of all genes (99.953th
and 99.995th percentiles, respectively), suggesting a
very strong enrichment in AR and ERG binding within
the PDE4D gene locus (see Supplementary Figure S8a).
However, since PDE4D is a comparably large gene
and spans approximately 1.5 Mb of genomic space, we
repeated this analysis using more than three million
randomly sampled genomic regions of 1.5 Mb size across
all major chromosomes. Again, we found that PDE4D was
highly enriched in AR and ERG binding peaks (95.151th
and 87.624th percentiles, respectively) compared to random
genomic stretches of comparable size (Supplementary

expression profiles and suggest an involvement of both AR
and ERG in overall PDE4D isoform regulation.

associated PDE4D isoform. Of the five TSS involved,
PDE4D5 showed the strongest negative association (r =
-0.571, Supplementary Table S3), while the four DMRs
near the PDE4D4 TSS showed varying agreement
between methylation and expression measurements,
ranging from r = -0.215 to r = -0.394. These results follow
the expected behaviour, as increased DNA methylation
impedes transcription [32]. Since the PDE4D1 and
PDE4D2 expression could not be independently measured
with the Exon Arrays, a negative correlation (r = -0.517)
was found for both. Lastly, PDE4D8 expression did not
show any association with DNA methylation (r = -0.233),
agreeing with our observation that this isoform is
not consistently expressed in prostate tissues (see
Supplementary Figure S1).

DNA methylation of defined regions in PDE4D is
altered in prostate cancer
To further study transcriptional regulation of
the PDE4D locus, we obtained public data of DNA
methylation in PCa patients from Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) and TCGA and performed statistical
analyses to identify hyper- and hypo-methylated regions
in PCa as compared to normal adjacent prostate (NAP).
The results of three different platforms determining
DNA methylation patterns consistently detected hypermethylated regions, indicating active silencing of several
PDE4D promoters in PCa, involving the transcription start
site (TSS) of a total of five PDE4D isoforms, namely the
short PDE4D1/2 isoforms and the long PDE4D4, PDE4D5
and PDE4D8 isoforms (see Supplementary Figure S9).
To estimate the impact of these differentially
methylated regions (DMRs) on isoform expression, we
used Affymetrix Human Exon Array samples obtained
from the same patients as the MeDIP-seq cohort [30, 31]
and calculated Spearman’s correlation coefficient for each
of the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and the

PDE4D isoforms can be used as diagnostic
and prognostic signature for prostate cancer:
application to prostate biopsies
Since PDE4D7 and PDE4D5 show opposing
behaviours in prostatic tissues, we created a diagnostic
signature based on the expression of PDE4D7 relative
to that of PDE4D5 expression (PDE4D7 - PDE4D5). In
order to evaluate its performance in distinguishing PCa
and non-PCa samples, we carried out ROC analyses in

Figure 5: AR and ERG binding peaks in PDE4D in the VCaP cell line. To visualize AR and ERG binding in PDE4D, genomic
locations of ChIP-seq peaks (GSE14092) denoting AR binding sites are coloured blue, while ERG peaks are coloured in red. If peaks of
both transcription factors overlap, the affected genomic regions are coloured in black. A genomic region surrounding each transcription start

all compatible datasets and compared the resulting AUCs
with PCA3 (Supplementary Table S4). Overall, our
diagnostic signature performed on par with PCA3, with
AUCs ranging from 0.839 to 0.934 compared to 0.857 to
0.921.
In order to evaluate the value of PDE4D as a
clinical biomarker, we used surgical resection materials
of eighteen patients and subjected them to needle biopsies
to obtain material from distinct areas, simulating both true
positive and false negative biopsies (see Supplementary
Table S5). In total, four biopsies with gradually increasing
distance from the tumour were taken per patient (within
tumour, edge of tumour, 5 mm from edge, and 10 mm
from edge) and PDE4D5 as well as PDE4D7 expression
were measured by qPCR. Ct values of both isoforms were
normalized to several reference genes (see Methods) and
adjusted to baseline expression in NAP tissue (10 mm
from edge). Both expression profiles showed inverse
correlation, with PDE4D5 expression decreasing in the
vicinity of the tumour, while PDE4D7 expression as
well as the diagnostic signature gradually increasing (see
Figure 6), confirming our earlier findings. Additionally,
a transient change of PDE4D isoform expression at the
tumour edge might suggest that nearby adjacent normal
tissue is influenced by tumour presence through a ‘field
effect’, but could also be due to averaging signals from
normal and cancerous cells.

Notably, expression of all long PDE4D isoforms
including PDE4D5 and PDE4D7 appears to decrease
during PCa progression (see Figure 1 and Supplementary
Figures S2-S3), while expression of the super-short
PDE4D isoforms PDE4D1 and PDE4D2 seemed to be
affected to a lesser extent. On this basis, we decided to
create a prognostic signature based on the expression level
of PDE4D1/2 relative to the sum of the expression levels
of the long PDE4D5, PDE4D7 and PDE4D9 isoforms
PDE4D7. The performance of this signature was then
evaluated in the Exon Array cohorts. Since, three datasets
had appropriate follow-up available, we used clinical
recurrence (CR) defined as development of metastases
after RP as clinical endpoint. Overall, our signature
performed well in distinguishing patients with CR from
those without, yielding AUCs of 0.826, 0.794 and 0.614
for the EMC, Taylor and Erho cohort, respectively
(Supplementary Table S4). Since the EMC dataset offered
time to biochemical recurrence (BCR), metastases-free
as well as overall survival time as follow-up information,
we performed a Kaplan-Meier analysis for this dataset
using our prognostic PDE4D signature. Two categories
(signature high and low) were defined by Partitioning
Around Medoids (PAM) and left-censoring was applied,
resulting in well separated curves for both metastases-free
and overall survival (p < 0.05, see Figure 7). Subsequently,
we used Cox proportional hazards regression model to

evaluate whether our PDE4D signature is an independent
predictor for clinical metastasis, BCR and overall
survival, taking into account the pre-operational PSA,
Gleason score, pathological stage, surgical margins and
patient age. For both metastases-free as well as overall
survival, the prognostic PDE4D signature was found to
be an independent predictor (p < 0.1), though confidence
intervals were large due to low numbers of samples and
events (Supplementary Table S6).

Our investigation of the transcriptional dynamics of
the PDE4D gene locus revealed a previously undescribed
promoter switch involving the major contributors of
PDE4D activity in normal prostate, namely the PDE4D5
and PDE4D9 long forms, as well as the prostate cancerassociated long isoform PDE4D7 [15, 16]. Unique
promoters for each PDE4D isoform, located upstream

of the exon(s) encoding their unique N-terminal regions
allow for the independent regulation of the different
mRNA and corresponding protein expression [6, 9,
33]. Here in this study we provide the first evidence of
condition-specific PDE4D promoter switching in a cancer
context.
Isoform switching in various genes (such as PKM,
CXCR3 and FGR2 [34–36]) during cancer development
has been described in several cancer types including
prostate cancer [37–40], and likewise tumour-specific
isoforms of known genes have been identified previously
[41]. Indeed, the androgen receptor variant 7 (AR-V7)
provides a particularly important example of a PCaspecific isoform that is constitutively active and ligandindependent, contributing to castration resistance of
prostate cancer cells [42, 43]. Furthermore, alternative
promoter usage of the androgen-regulated gene TMPRSS2
as part of the TMPRSS2-ERG fusion gene also has been
associated with clinical outcome [44, 45].
Interestingly, mounting evidence suggests
crosstalk between AR and cAMP signalling pathways,
with important cAMP downstream targets such as PKA
and ERK interacting either with the AR or AR target
genes [4, 46–48]. PDEs, in providing the sole route for
degrading cAMP are poised to play a key regulatory role,
particularly so as the targeting of particular isoforms to
distinct signalling complexes confers a spatial aspect that
allows particular isoforms to have specific functional roles
[6]. Therefore, it is particularly intriguing to find that
specific PDE4D isoforms expressed in prostatic tissues
appear to be androgen regulated (PDE4D7 and PDE4D5),
suggesting a complex network of interactions that links
both pathways. We should, however, mention that studies
of PDE4D7 expression in the VCaP prostate cancer cell
line implied that it was not directly regulated by AR [15].
However, VCaP harbours genomic rearrangements on
chr5q that are characteristic of chromothripsis, and more
importantly, PDE4D is reportedly involved in gene fusions
with FAM172A and C5orf47 [49]. With regards to the ARinduced up-regulation of PDE4D7 observed in LNCaP
cells, these structural rearrangements in VCaP could be
involved in a loss of AR-mediated regulation of PDE4D7
due to relocation or deletion of regulatory elements such as
AR binding elements. An alternative explanation could be
that PDE4D7 expression is indirectly linked to AR activity,
as its promoter region overlaps PART1, a known AR
target gene that showed clear association with androgen
treatment in VCaP [15, 50, 51]. In the Exon Array datasets
that we analysed, both genes seem to be co-expressed
in prostatic tissues (mean Spearman’s rho = 0.7269).
However, given the fact that PDE4D5 was significantly
down-regulated in LNCaP upon AR stimulation as well,
we believe that AR directly influences PDE4D isoform
expression through interaction with proximal or distal
regulatory elements [52, 53]. This hypothesis is supported
by the ChIP-seq data for AR, which identifies numerous
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

binding peaks for AR in the PDE4D gene locus, including
the PDE4D5 and PDE4D7/PART1 promoter regions.
Similarly, ERG seems to have a major contribution
on PDE4D isoform expression, with us previously
reporting that PDE4D7 is up-regulated in TMPRSS2ERG positive PCa [16]. Here, we provided further
ChIP-seq support for ERG involvement in PDE4D
expression. However, the Exon Array datasets analysed
here do not provide conclusive evidence for a link of ERG
overexpression with other isoforms, such as PDE4D5. It
appears therefore plausible that ERG overexpression may
be specifically linked to PDE4D7 expression, highlighting
a connection of the latter to the AR pathway, as well as its
potential oncogenic role [15].
To investigate whether DNA methylation could be
involved in the promoter switch uncovered in this study,
we analysed three independent datasets based on different
technologies, whereupon we discovered consistent increases
of DNA methylation near the PDE4D5 TSS in PCa samples.
In conjunction with the observed AR-mediated downregulation of PDE4D5, these results could well explain
the profound down-regulation of PDE4D5 in localized and
advanced PCa and could hint at a protective function in
normal prostate that is inhibited by gene silencing in PCa.
In addition, we found increased DNA methylation near the
PDE4D1/2 TSS that could not be linked to significantly
altered gene expression, while other isoforms showing
differential methylation (PDE4D4, PDE4D8) do not seem
to be consistently expressed in prostatic tissues. Indeed, it
is even possible that the increased DNA methylation in the
promoter regions of specific PDE4D isoforms might induce
promoter switching to PDE4D7 by inhibiting expression of
other PDE4D isoforms.
Unlike PDE4D5, PDE4D9 does not show signs of
androgen regulation despite being down-regulated in PCa
and we could not find evidence for DNA methylationmediated regulation of PDE4D9 expression in PCa. Thus,
its transcriptional regulation in PCa remains unclear at this
point and solicits further study.
Taken together, the observed switch in isoform
usage might imply that regulatory mechanisms of
PDE4D-catalyzed cAMP degradation are subjected to
AR signalling in PCa cells that, in turn, indicates that
PDE4D7-specific protein domains are necessary to
regulate cAMP signalling in an androgen-dependent
manner, offering a potentially new drug target [15, 16, 18].
Moreover, with the transition to an androgen-independent
state, expression of long PDE4D isoforms seems to fade,
reaching its minimum in castration-resistant conditions
and distant metastases, while expression of the super-short
isoforms PDE4D1 and PDE4D2 appears to remain rather
stable. Importantly, these super-short isoforms contain
the catalytic domain of PDE4D but lack the UCR1/
UCR2 domains seen in long PDE4D isoforms, a module
that confers regulation by various kinases and influences
intracellular targeting [6, 18].

Hence, this effective loss of regulation of PDE4D
activity can be expected to generate profound changes in
compartmentalized cAMP signaling due to altered spatial
localization and cross-talk governing cAMP degradation,
and may thereby contribute to cancer aggressiveness
similarly to mechanisms suggested for MAPKs [54] and
AR in form of its splice variant AR-V7 [43].
PDE4D isoform composition appears to have merit
in being used as a diagnostic signature following the
expression of PDE4D7 and PDE4D5, as well as serving
as a prognostic signature following the difference between
the expression of long and short PDE4D isoforms.
Evaluating both signatures, we found that they exhibited
good performance in distinguishing PCa from normal
tissue and progressive from non-progressive samples,
respectively. Importantly, diagnostic performance was
robust to differences in technology, data processing, as
well as potential differences in composition and patient
characteristics of the used cohorts, demonstrating a
high cross-platform reproducibility of PDE4D isoforms
as PCa biomarker and yielding results comparable to
the established PCa-marker PCA3 in all tested cohorts.
Hence, with further optimization to an appropriate test
platform prior to clinical utilization, we could imagine
that such signatures might provide a valuable addition to
complement existing test procedures.
When applying our diagnostic signature to prostate
biopsies, PDE4D isoform expression appeared to return
to its ‘normal’ state with increasing distance from the
tumour, whereas the tumour edge showed an intermediate
signal. This observation could hint at a ‘field effect’ of
the tumour on and/or crosstalk of the tumour cells with
the surrounding microenvironment [55–58]. It would
therefore be fascinating to further explore in the future
whether such a ‘field effect’ indeed influences PDE4D
isoform composition, effectively increasing the target area
for biopsies, or whether our observations were caused by
averaging signals from adjacent tumour and normal cells.
If validated, an increased target area could boost accuracy
of prostate biopsies, reducing the number of false negative
tests. Furthermore, it would be highly interesting to see
whether reversing the isoform composition to its normal
state has an influence on prostate cell phenotype and
behaviour.
While our study focused on PDE4D isoform
expression in primary PCa samples, genomic alterations
of the PDE4D locus such as microdeletions have been
observed in other cancers [27]. Moreover, a recent study
found that mutations in other members of the PDE family
could be related to PCa by affecting intracellular cAMP
and/or cGMP levels [59]. Considering the large number
of PDE genes and isoforms as well as the tight regulation
of cAMP signalling and its degradation, it is very well
possible that PDEs such as PDE4D are key players in
other conditions, as the broad panel of associated diseases
underscores [10–14]. Therefore, it is worthwhile to extend

the presented study and screen the expression profiles of
all known PDEs in various tissues and conditions to define
basal expression levels and reveal potential alterations and
novel targets for drug interventions.
Taken together, our findings highlight the potential
of PDE4D isoforms to be promising new biomarkers and
potential therapeutic targets for localized and advanced
prostate cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of PDE4D isoform expression in
prostate tissues
Quantification of PDE4D isoforms in patient
materials was performed by qRT-PCR as described in [16].
In addition, six independent Exon Array datasets were used
in this study and raw CEL files were obtained via Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) or personal communication.
The datasets comprised GSE21034 [25], GSE29079
[30], GSE46691 [60], GSE32875 [28] as well as patient
samples from GSE41410 [61, 62] and samples published
in [63]. These datasets are referred to as ‘Taylor’, ‘Brase’,
‘Erho’, ‘Rajan’, ‘EMC’, and ‘Nijmegen’, respectively.
Of note, patients PCA0041, PCA0042 and PCA0119
of the Taylor dataset were marked as ‘treated with salvage
radical prostatectomy (RP)’, meaning they previously
failed radiotherapy treatment and were subsequently
treated with RP. Therefore, Exon Array expression data
for PCA0119 were not used for survival analysis.
Raw data were processed and RMA normalized
using the aroma.affymetrix R-package ([64], CDF used:
HuEx-1_0-stv2,extendedR3,A20071112,EP.CDF,
see
http://www.aroma-project.org/). Expression of transcript
isoforms was measured by using log2-transformed
intensity values of isoform-specific probesets: PDE4D1/2
(2858166); PDE4D3 (2858290, 2858291); PDE4D4
(2858368, 2858369, 2858370); PDE4D5 (2858345,
2858346, 2858347); PDE4D6 (2858155, 2858156);
PDE4D7 (2858406, 2858407, 2858408); PDE4D8
(2858257, 2858258); PDE4D9 (2858240, 2858241). These
intensity values were normalized to a set of reference
genes (HPRT1, PUM1, TBP, POLR2A, TUBA1B) by
using the mean intensity of ‘core’ probesets of each gene’s
transcript cluster (3991698, 2404254, 2937984, 3453732,
3708704) to estimate gene expression and then using the
average reference gene expression as normalization factor.
This normalization factor was subtracted from the probeset
intensity values, and normalized probeset expression was
subsequently averaged per PDE4D isoform. In addition,
expression of the PCa associated genes was normalized
the same way as PDE4D, using ‘core’ and ‘extended’
probesets of transcript cluster 3175538 to measure PCA3
as well as 3931765 for ERG and 2811145 for PART1.
Lastly, level 3 processed RNA-seq expression
values for PRAD samples were obtained from TCGA
70679

Oncotarget

(https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/) via the TCGA-Assembler
R-package [65]. For each sample, the RSEM ‘scaled
estimate’ values were used and multiplied by 106 to
convert the values to transcripts per million (TPM). Error
bars in plots represent standard deviation unless stated
otherwise.

factors were created by using the ecdf() function of
R-package stats. Hexbinplots were generated using the
BoutrosLab.plotting.general R-package (http://labs.oicr.
on.ca/boutros-lab/software/bpg).

Analysis of deletions of PDE4D and impact on
isoform expression

Public methylation data were downloaded from
GEO and TCGA data portal and comprised three
different technologies. 1) Deduplicated and extended
MeDIP-seq reads (200 nt) deposited under accession
number GSE35342 [31] were downloaded from Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and processed via the
MEDIPS R-package [69]. Using genomic bins of 100 nt
for chromosome 5, reads were counted for every sample
and differential methylation status of each bin was tested
using the following MEDIPS settings as suggested
by the authors upon request: ‘diff.method = “edgeR”,
prob.method = “poisson”, MeDIP = F, CNV = F’. Bins
covering the genomic region of PDE4D including 50
kb flanks and with a Bonferroni-adjusted p-value below
0.01 were selected and merged into larger regions of
interest (ROIs) if they were directly adjacent. 2) Preprocessed public bisulfite sequencing (BiS-seq) data
available from GEO (GSE41701, [70]) were downloaded,
and measured positions found in the genomic region of
PDE4D including 50 kb flanks were extracted. For each
position, the percentage of reads indicating methylation
was calculated by #base calls C / (#base calls C +
#base calls T) based on the number of reads covering a
particular base. Next, the limma R-package [71, 72] was
used to identify positions with significant differences in
methylation between PCa vs. benign, as well as CRPC
vs. PCa. Positions with FDR < 0.05 were selected and
merged into larger regions if they were within 100 nts of
each other. 3) TCGA level 3 data for Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChips were downloaded from
TCGA data portal and only patients with available clinical
information were used for further analysis. Pre-calculated
beta values for chromosome 5 were imported into Minfi
[73] and annotated using ‘ilmn12.hg19’. Analysis of
differential methylation was performed via bumphunter
using 100 permutations and ‘cutoff=0.15’. Lastly, any
significant probes located within the genomic region
of PDE4D including 50 kb flanks were extracted and
methylation profiles were correlated to RNA expression
via Spearman’s correlation coefficient. Visualisation of
methylated regions was performed using ggBio [67].

Investigation of PDE4D promoter methylation

Gene-level copy number alterations were obtained
from TCGA via the TCGA-Assembler R-package [65] and
a cut-off of ±log2(1.5/2) was used to call gains and losses
of genetic material, respectively. A Wilcoxon-MannWhitney test was used to identify significant changes in
expression of PDE4D isoforms between samples with and
without alterations.

Evaluation of AR and ERG expression / binding
on PDE4D transcription
To determine the (TMPRSS2-)ERG status of
patient samples in Exon Array cohorts, we used relative
ERG expression values and applied Partitioning Around
Medoids (PAM, R-package ‘cluster’, k = 2) to assign the
patient samples to the ERG positive or negative group
based on expression. Lastly, a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitneytest was used to detect statistically significant differences
(p < 0.05) between the ERG positive and ERG negative
samples. Likewise, differences between R1881 treated
and untreated LNCaP cells [28] were tested using a
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney-test. To investigate transcription
factor binding, public ChIP-seq peaks for AR and ERG
were obtained from GEO (GSE14092) and overlapped
with PDE4D TSS ± 2 kb regions using bedtools [66]
after conversion to hg19 coordinates using the liftOver
executable (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgLiftOver).
Distances of the nearest AR and ERG peaks to each
PDE4D isoform TSS were calculated by ‘bedtools closest’
using the options ‘-k 5 and -d’. Data visualization was
based on the ggBio R-package [67]. Enrichment of AR
and ERG peaks in the PDE4D gene locus was investigated
by counting the number of ChIP-seq peaks of each
transcription factor within 21,209 RefSeq gene loci (hg19)
as well as randomly sampled genomic regions of 1.5 Mb.
Unique gene loci were defined by the minimum and
maximum chromosomal coordinates of RefSeq NM and
NR transcripts belonging to the same gene identifier after
associating them to HGNC gene symbols using biomaRt
[68] and excluding minor chromosomes and haplotypes.
For each chromosome, random regions were sampled
according to: number of regions = (chromosome size in
Mb * 1000) and any regions overlapping the PDE4D gene
locus were excluded. Counting was performed by bedtools
[66] annotate using the option ‘-counts’ and empirical
cumulative distribution functions for both transcription

Analysis of signature performance, survival and
independent predictor variable
We created a diagnostic signature based on
PDE4D7 expression relative to PDE4D5 expression
(PDE4D7-PDE4D5) as well as a prognostic signature
for the Exon Array cohorts based on PDE4D1/2 relative

to PDE4D5, PDE4D7 and PDE4D9 ((PDE4D1/2) (PDE4D5+PDE4D7+PDE4D9)). Subsequently, the
R-packages ‘ROC’ and ‘survival’ were used to carry out
ROC analyses and perform a Cox regression as well as
Kaplan-Meier analysis based on available survival data of
the EMC dataset [61, 62].

Quantification of diagnostic PDE4D signature in
prostate biopsies
Several biopsy punches (approximately 1 x 2 mm)
were taken in a representative tumour area after surgical
prostate resections in eighteen different men with prostate
cancer. Experimental protocols were approved by the
Erasmus MC Medical Ethics Committee following the
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act. For
each patient, these punches were performed within the
tumour, at the edge of the tumour area, at 5 and at 10
mm distance to the tumour region. RNA was extracted
and qRT-PCRs (quantitative real-time PCR) for PDE4D5
and PDE4D7 were performed as described in [16], using
ACTB, HPRT1, TUBA1B, POLR2A, PUM1 and TBP
as reference genes. The expression of PDE4D5 and
PDE4D7 in each biopsy tissue was normalized as follows:
mean(Ct(reference genes)) – Ct(PDE4DX). For each of
the eighteen different patients, the normalized expression
of PDE4D transcripts within the tumour was set to 1 and
expression values for biopsies taken at various distances
from the tumour were calculated relative to the expression
in the tumour. Lastly, average relative expression and
standard error of the mean of PDE4D transcript expression
were plotted for each of the respective biopsy locations.
