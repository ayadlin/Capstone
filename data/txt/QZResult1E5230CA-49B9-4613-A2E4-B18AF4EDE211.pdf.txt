Polysome Proﬁling Links Translational
Control to the Radioresponse of Glioblastoma
Stem-like Cells

Abstract
Changes in polysome-bound mRNA (translatome) are correlated closely with changes in the proteome in cells. Therefore, to
better understand the processes mediating the response of glioblastoma to ionizing radiation (IR), we used polysome proﬁling to
deﬁne the IR-induced translatomes of a set of human glioblastoma
stem-like cell (GSC) lines. Although cell line speciﬁcity accounted
for the largest proportion of genes within each translatome, there
were also genes that were common to the GSC lines. In particular,
analyses of the IR-induced common translatome identiﬁed components of the DNA damage response, consistent with a role
for the translational control of gene expression in cellular radioresponse. Moreover, translatome analyses suggested that IR
enhanced cap-dependent translation processes, an effect corrob-

orated by the ﬁnding of increased eIF4F–cap complex formation
detected after irradiation in all GSC lines. Translatome analyses
also predicted that Golgi function was affected by IR. Accordingly,
Golgi dispersal was detected after irradiation of each of the GSC
lines. In addition to the common responses seen, translatome
analyses predicted cell line–speciﬁc changes in mitochondria, as
substantiated by changes in mitochondrial mass and DNA content. Together, these results suggest that analysis of radiationinduced translatomes can provide new molecular insights concerning the radiation response of cancer cells. More speciﬁcally,
they suggest that the translational control of gene expression may
provide a source of molecular targets for glioblastoma radiosensitization. Cancer Res; 76(10); 3078–87. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

Arguing against this scenario is the poor correlation between IRinduced changes in mRNAs and their corresponding proteins (3).
It is this uncoupling of the transcriptome and proteome after
irradiation that calls into question the functional signiﬁcance of
IR-induced gene expression. However, eukaryotic gene expression, in contrast to prokaryotes, is regulated not only through
transcription but also through a series of posttranscriptional
events, a process referred to as translational control, a critical
determinant of gene expression. Under a variety of biologic and
experimental conditions (4–8), translational control has been
shown to account for the discrepancies between the transcriptome
and proteome. An approach that bypasses posttranscriptional
processes and identiﬁes genes undergoing translation, that is, the
translatome, is the microarray analysis of polysome-bound RNA
(9, 10). We initially applied this technique to long established
glioma cell lines 6 hours after exposure to 7 Gy and included a
comparison with the traditional microarray analysis of total
cellular RNA (11). The data generated showed that the number
of genes whose translational activity was modiﬁed by IR was
greater than those affected in the transcriptome analysis. Moreover, there were few, if any genes affected in both the transcriptome and translatome, indicating that the processes are not
coordinated with each proceeding through different mechanisms.
Of signiﬁcance and in contrast to changes in the transcriptome,
there was a correlation between the genes whose translational
activity was affected by IR and the expression of the corresponding
proteins. The implication of this study was that radiation does
modify gene expression, but does so primarily via translational
control.
The correlation between changes in polysome-bound mRNA
and the corresponding protein suggests that deﬁning the translatome in irradiated cells will generate unique insight into the

Investigations into the molecular processes mediating the
cellular response to ionizing radiation (IR) have, for the most
part, focused on the posttranslational modiﬁcation of existing
proteins. These studies have led to a detailed understanding of
signaling pathways involved in such fundamental components of
radioresponse as DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoint activation, and
apoptosis. As an additional regulatory process, modiﬁcations in
gene expression have long been thought to contribute to cellular
radioresponse. This premise was initially based on data from
prokaryotes in which radiation-induced gene expression provides
an adaptive or protective response against radiation-induced
death. In eukaryotic cells, IR has been shown to induce transcription of speciﬁc genes and at the whole genome level modify the
cellular transcriptome (1, 2). Such results are reminiscent of the
prokaryotic adaptive response, and thus suggest that deﬁning the
inducible genes would not only provide information regarding
the mechanisms determining radioresponse of mammalian cells
but also identify molecular targets for modifying radiosensitivity.

Radiation-Induced Translational Control of Gene Expression

processes comprising cellular radioresponse, and for tumor cells
may suggest strategies for enhancing radiosensitivity. Towards
this end, we have extended our initial investigation to glioblastoma stem-like cell (GSC) lines. Although the biology of long
established glioma cell lines has little in common with glioblastomas in situ, GSCs are thought to be a clonogenic subpopulation
critical to the development, maintenance, and treatment response
of glioblastomas (12–14). The data presented here deﬁne the IRinduced translatomes for three GSC lines. Subsequent translatome analyses identiﬁed both common and line-speciﬁc consequences of GSC irradiation, which were then validated at the
functional level. These results further implicate translational
control of gene expression as a fundamental component of
cellular radioresponse.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and treatments
Studies were performed using three neurosphere-forming cultures isolated from human glioblastoma surgical specimens as
described (15) and maintained as frozen stocks: NSC11 (kindly
provided by Dr. Frederick Lang, MD Anderson Cancer Center in
2008); 0923 (16) was obtained from the Neuro-Oncology
Branch, NCI, in 2013; and GBMJ1 (17) was generated at Mofﬁtt
Cancer Center in 2008. Cell lines were revived every 2 months
from frozen stocks made after receiving cell lines and were recently
authenticated in May 2015, by STR analysis (Idexx Laboratories).
Neurospheres were maintained in stem cell medium consisting of
DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen), B27 supplement (Invitrogen), and
human recombinant bFGF and EGF (50 ng/mL each; R&D Systems) at 37 C, 5% CO2/5% O2. CD133þ cells (NSC11 and
GBMJ1; refs. 17, 18) or CD15þ cells (0923; refs. 19, 20) were
isolated from each neurosphere cultures by FACS and used as a
source for the described experiments (17). The CD133þ and
CD15þ cell cultures met the criteria for tumor stem-like cells
including self-renewal, differentiation along glial and neuronal
pathways, expression of stem cell–related genes, and formation of
brain tumors when implanted in immunodeﬁcient mice. For use
in an in vitro experiment, CD133þ or CD15þ neurosphere cultures
were disaggregated into single cells as described (17) and seeded
onto poly-L-ornithine (Invitrogen)/laminin (Sigma) coated tissue
culture dishes in stem cell media. Under these conditions, singlecell GSCs attach and proliferate maintaining their CD133þ or
CD15þ expression and stem-like characteristics (21). Radiation
was delivered using a 320 kV X-ray machine (Precision XRay Inc.)
at a dose rate of 2.3 Gy/minute; control cultures were mock
irradiated. Cell cultures were treated with 4 mmol/L INK128
(Chemietek) dissolved in DMSO or vehicle control immediately
after irradiation.
Polysome isolation and microarray analysis
Isolation of polysome-bound RNA was performed in triplicate
as described by Galban et al. (22) with slight modiﬁcations.
Brieﬂy, cells were grown to approximately 80% conﬂuency in
150-mm2 culture dishes and irradiated or mock irradiated. At time
of collection, cells were incubated with 100 mg/mL of cycloheximide for 15 minutes at 37 C, 5%CO2/5%O2. Cytoplasmic RNA
was collected by lysing cells in polysome buffer [15 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 300 mmol/L NaCl, 15 mmol/L MgCl2, 1%
Triton X100, 100 mg/mL cycloheximide, 1 mg/mL heparin, and
500 U/mL RNasin (Promega)]. After 15 minutes on ice, lysates

www.aacrjournals.org

were centrifuged (12,000  g for 15 minutes), and the resulting
cytosolic supernatant was layered onto a 10% to 50% sucrose
gradient. Gradients were then centrifuged at 35,000  g for
3 hours at 4 C and polysome-bound fractions were collected
using an ISCO Density Gradient Fractionation System (ISCO)
with continuous monitoring based on A254. The RNA in each
fraction was extracted using TRIzol LS (Invitrogen). The
integrity of the RNA was assured using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).
The isolated RNA was ampliﬁed with GeneChip 30 IVT Express Kit
(Affymetrix) and hybridized to GeneChip Human Genome
U133A 2.0 Array chips (Affymetrix) per manufacturer's protocol. Using Affymetrix Expression Console, MAS5 normalization
was performed and the means of probe set intensities that
were modiﬁed by at least 1.5-fold with a Student two-tailed
t test value of P < 0.05 (vs. control) were identiﬁed and submitted to Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA; QIAGEN, www.
qiagen.com/ingenuity) for core analysis and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; refs. 23, 24) using the MSigDB gene set
C5 [Gene Ontology (GO) gene sets]. Heatmaps were created
using R version 3.0.1. Microarray data have been deposited in
NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (25) and are accessible
through GEO Series accession number GSE74084 (http://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc¼GSE74084).
Total RNA isolation
Total RNA, also in biologic triplicates, was extracted from
cells using TRIzol (Invitrogen) followed by the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen). The integrity of the RNA was assured using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent).
Cap-binding assay
eIF4F–cap complex formation was measured with m7-GTP
batch chromatography as described previously (26, 27). Brieﬂy,
cells were lysed in 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L b-glycerophosphate, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, 1% Triton X-100,
0.2 mmol/L PMSF, 1 phosphatase inhibitor cocktails II and III
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1 HALT protease inhibitor cocktail
(Thermo Scientiﬁc) for 15 minutes on ice. Lysate (400 mg) was
incubated with 200 mL of immobilized g-aminophenyl-m7-GTP
agarose (Jena Bioscience) overnight at 4 C. Beads were washed
three times with lysis buffer; bound protein was eluted, denatured, and then separated with SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting for eIF4G (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 4E-BP1, and eIF4E
(Cell Signaling Technology).
Immunoﬂuorescent analysis of gH2AX foci
To visualize foci, cells grown in chamber slides were ﬁxed with
4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100,
and blocked with 1% BSA in PBS containing 5% goat serum. The
slides were incubated with antibody to phospho-H2AX (Millipore) followed by incubation with goat-anti-mouse-Alexa Fluor
488 (Invitrogen) and mounted with Prolong gold antifade
reagent containing DAPI (Invitrogen) to visualize nuclei. Cells
were analyzed on a Zeiss upright ﬂuorescent microscope.
Measurement of Golgi area
Immunoﬂuorescent images of cells stained with a conjugated
antibody to the cis-Golgi marker GM130 (BD Biosciences) and
ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Life Technologies) and
were measured by manual demarcation of the Golgi with a
limiting polygon and calculation of its area using ImageJ software.

after irradiation than at 6 hours. As indicated by the overlap in the
NSC11 Venn diagram, most of the gene changes at 6 hours were
also present at 1 hour after irradiation, suggesting that in these cells
the processes mediating radiation-induced translational control
are operative primarily within the ﬁrst hour after exposure. However, in GBMJ1 cells, more genes were affected at 6 hours than at
1 hour; in 0923 cells, although, there was a substantial overlap in
the gene changes detected at both time points, there were more
genes unique to 6-hour than 1-hour after irradiation.
Given the disparate time courses among GSCs, we deﬁned the
radiation-induced translatome of each line by combining the gene
lists obtained at 1- and 6-hour after irradiation (Fig. 1B). The
number of genes comprising the radiation-induced translatome
varied among the GSC lines with 0923 cells being the most
susceptible to radiation-induced translation control and GBMJ1
the least. A direct comparison of GSC lines in terms of genes
comprising the radiation-induced translatome is shown in Fig. 1C
and D. Although cell line speciﬁcity accounted for the largest
proportion of genes within each translatome, there were also
genes in common among the GSC lines. For genes whose polysome binding was increased after irradiation, there were 136 in
common between all three lines and 1,416 increased in at least
two lines (Fig. 1C; Supplementary Table S1); for the genes whose
polysome binding was decreased in response to radiation, there
were six in common between all three lines and 216 decreased in
two of the three lines (Fig. 1D; Supplementary Table S2).

Mitochondrial analyses
Mitochondrial mass was determined using MitoTracker Green
FM (Invitrogen). Cells attached to poly-L-ornithine/laminin-coated
plates were stained with 80 nmol/L MitoTracker Green FM in
stem cell medium for 15 minutes at 37 C, 5%CO2/5%O2. Cells
were then trypsinized, rinsed with Dulbecco's Phosphate Buffered Saline (DPBS), resuspended in DPBS, and analyzed using a
FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was
extracted using DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and quantiﬁed using qPCR using 7500 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) and RT2 SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix (Qiagen).
To evaluate mtDNA content, relative amounts of mtDNA-encoded
cytochrome c oxidase subunit II (qHsaCED0048349; Bio-Rad) were
determined by the DDCt method using nuclear DNA-encoded
b-globin (qHsaCED0048812; Bio-Rad) as an internal control.
Statistical analysis
Statistical signiﬁcance was determined using Student t test
using Excel. Values of P < 0.05 were considered signiﬁcant. Data
are expressed as means  SEM.

Results
IR-induced translatomes
To investigate radiation-induced translational control in GSCs,
polysome-bound mRNA was isolated by sucrose gradient fractionation and subjected to DNA microarray-based gene expression analysis (11). Speciﬁcally, polysome-bound RNA was collected 1 and 6 hours after irradiation (2 Gy) of three GSCs
(NSC11, 0923, and GBMJ1) with gene expression levels compared with their respective, unirradiated controls. The number of
genes whose polysome association was increased or decreased
(P-value 0.05, fold change 1.5) at 1 or 6 hours after irradiation relative to controls is shown in Fig. 1A. Previous studies of the
IR-induced translatome involved evaluation of only the 6-hour
time (11, 28). In NSC11 cells, more genes were affected at 1 hour

Functional analysis of the IR-induced translatome
IR-induced gene expression has traditionally been evaluated
using total cellular mRNA, which provides a measure of the
cellular transcriptome. Consistent with our previous report using
established cell lines (11), comparison of the IR-induced translatomes and transcriptomes from GSCs revealed few commonly
affected genes (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that novel
information pertaining to cellular radioresponse can be obtained

Radiation-Induced Translational Control of Gene Expression

from analysis of their IR-induced translatomes. Along these lines,
the functional signiﬁcance of IR-induced translational control was
initially investigated using IPA, which assigns genes into networks
and then associates the networks with functions and pathways.
For this analysis, we used the common translatome deﬁned as
those transcripts whose polysome binding were enhanced after
irradiation in at least two of the three GSC lines (1,416 genes). Of
the functions assigned to the top 20 networks enriched by IR
(Table 1), six contained "DNA Replication, Recombination and
Repair," critical processes in cellular radioresponse. Among the
canonical pathways upregulated by radiation was "Cell Cycle:
G1–S Checkpoint Regulation" (P ¼ 1.96  1003; Fig. 2), which
is also an established component of cellular radioresponse. Of
note, none of the 21 genes shown as induced in the common
translatome in Fig. 2 were also present in the common radiation-induced transcriptome of the GSCs. For the genes whose
translation was downregulated after GSC irradiation, IPA
revealed no obvious relationships to radioresponse (Supplementary Table S3). This initial analysis is thus consistent with
translational control playing a role in the events mediating the
cellular response to IR.
Cap-dependent translation
In addition to DNA repair and cell-cycle checkpoint regulation, further interrogation of the radiation-induced GSC translatome suggested the activation of other cell processes not
traditionally associated with radioresponse. For example,
upstream signaling analysis (IPA) linked a set of 23 genes in
the common IR-induced GSC translatome (Fig. 3A, red symbols) to the activation of eIF4E and mTOR (Fig. 3A, orange
symbols), implying that cap-dependent translation is increased
after GSC irradiation. Essential to cap-dependent translation is
the interaction of eIF4E with eIF4G, resulting in the formation
of the eIF4F–50 mRNA cap complex (29). Thus, to test the
accuracy of this prediction, we determined the effects of radiation on eIF4F-cap complex formation using m7-GTP batch
chromatography to pull down the bound eIF4F complex, which
was then subjected to immunoblotting for eIF4E, 4EBP1, and
eIF4G. As shown in Fig. 3B, treatment of GSCs with the ATPcompetitive mTOR inhibitor INK128 reduced cap complex

formation as indicated by the decrease in eIF4G and increase
in 4EBP1 pulled down with eIF4E, consistent with previous
studies (30, 31). In contrast, IR increased the amount of eIF4G
pulled down, signifying an increase in cap complex formation
in each of the GSC lines. The IR-induced increase was prevented, however, when INK128 was added immediately after
irradiation, suggesting that radiation-induced cap complex
formation requires mTOR activity.
To further investigate the potential link between mTOR-mediated cap-dependent translation and GSC radioresponse, the effect
of INK128 on radiation-induced gH2AX foci induction and
dispersal were determined (Fig. 3C). The critical lesion responsible for radiation-induced cell death is the DNA double-strand
break (DSB); gH2AX foci induction corresponds to the induction
DSBs and their dispersal correlates with their repair (32, 33). In
this study, GSCs were exposed to 2 Gy and either INK128 or
vehicle (Control) was added immediately after irradiation with
nuclear foci determined at time points out to 24 hours. For all
three GSCs, no difference between INK128- and vehicle-treated
cells was detected at 1 hour after irradiation, suggesting that
INK128 had no effect on the initial level of IR-induced DSBs.
However, at 6 and 24 hours after irradiation, the number of
gH2AX foci remaining in the INK128-treated cells was signiﬁcantly greater than in the control cells, consistent with an inhibition of DNA DSB repair. Consistent with the gH2AX foci results
and a previous study using the mTOR inhibitor AZD2014 (34),
addition of INK128 immediately after irradiation enhanced the
radiosensitivity of each of the GSC lines (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Thus, although mTOR has other activities (35), given that the IRinduced GSC translatome contained genes associated with the
DNA repair (Fig. 2), the results in Fig. 3B and C implicate capdependent translation as a mediator of GSC radioresponse.
Golgi morphology
GSEA was used as an additional approach to evaluate the
radiation-induced translatomes. Hierarchical clustering of normalized enrichment scores (NES) of GO terms illustrates the
similarities and differences between GSC lines (Fig. 4A). The top
portion of the heat map (demarcated by  ) indicates the GO terms
in which the radiation-induced translatomes of the three GSCs

were most similar. Among the GO terms in this region were six of
the seven associated with the Golgi apparatus; enrichment plots
for the speciﬁc GO term Golgi_Apparatus_Part show a similar
pattern of enrichment across GSC lines (Fig. 4B). Because this
analysis predicts that radiation-induced translational control
inﬂuences Golgi in the GSCs, we determined the effects of
radiation on Golgi morphology as previously described (36). For
this assay, GSCs were irradiated and 24 hours later subjected to
immunoﬂuorescent cytochemical analysis for GM130, a highly
expressed cis-Golgi protein, allowing for visualization of Golgi
morphology. Farber-Katz and colleagues recently showed that
after irradiation of a variety of established cell lines, Golgi morphology shifts from a perinuclear to a more fragmented, cytoplasmic distribution, which was referred to as Golgi dispersal and
quantiﬁed as Golgi area per cell (36). As shown in Fig. 4C and D,
irradiation of GSCs resulted in a dose-dependent increase in Golgi
dispersal with NSC11 being the most susceptible. Treatment of
GSCs with INK128 immediately after irradiation essentially eliminated the IR-induced change in Golgi morphology. These data
indicate that the radiation-induced Golgi dispersal in GSCs
required mTOR activity implying a role for radiation-induced
translational control and consistent with GSEA.

Mitochondria
The hierarchical clustering of GO terms also suggested cell line–
speciﬁc consequences of radiation-induced translational control.
Speciﬁcally, the region designated by " " in Fig. 4A contains 10 of
13 GO terms associated with mitochondria, which were enriched
in NSC11, diminished in 0923, and unchanged in GBMJ1. The
normalized enrichment scores for all 13 mitochondrial GO terms
(Supplementary Table S4) were positive for NSC11, negative for
0923, and a mixture of positive and negative for GBMJ1. Enrichment plots for mitochondrion (Fig. 5A), the mitochondria-associated GO term encompassing the largest number of genes,
illustrate the differences between the radiation-induced translatomes for each GSC line in terms of mitochondria. A cell line–
speciﬁc role for mitochondria was also suggested when radiationinduced translatomes from each of the GSCs were subjected to
IPA. In contrast to Figs. 2 and 3 evaluating commonly increased
genes, this IPA included genes from each GSC that increased and
decreased in response to radiation. The IPA canonical pathways
"Mitochondrial Dysfunction" and "Oxidative Phosphorylation"
were signiﬁcantly enhanced in irradiated NSC11 cells with two of
the three most signiﬁcant P-values (4.34  1007 and 3.66 
1006, respectively); a number of genes in these pathways were

upregulated as shown in Fig. 5B (top). Both "Mitochondrial
Dysfunction" and "Oxidative Phosphorylation" also appeared in
IPA of irradiated 0923 cells (P values of 8.44  1010 and 1.84 
106, respectively); however, the associated genes were downregulated (Fig. 5B, bottom). Neither "Mitochondrial Dysfunction
or "Oxidative Phosphorylation" appeared in IPA of irradiated
GBMJ1 cells. Thus, both GSEA and IPA predicted that radiation
enhances mitochondrial function in NSC11 cells, inhibits mitochondria in 0923 cells and has no effect on mitochondria in
GBMJ1 cells.
To test this prediction, mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) content were quantiﬁed in the GSC lines (Fig. 5C
and D). IR induced an increase in both mitochondrial mass and
mtDNA in NSC11, consistent with an increase in mitochondrial
activity and thus the IR-induced translatome. No change in
mitochondrial mass or mtDNA was detected after irradiation of
GBMJ1, again consistent with translatome analysis. In 0923 cells,
although mitochondrial mass was unchanged after irradiation,

www.aacrjournals.org

there was a signiﬁcant decrease in mtDNA. In response to other
types of injury, a decrease in mtDNA was associated with a shift to
glycolytic energy production reﬂecting a reduction in mitochondrial function (37). Thus, as predicted by analysis of the radiationinduced translatomes, whether irradiation inﬂuences mitochondria and whether the inﬂuence was positive or negative was GSC
line dependent. Supporting the validity of the microarray analysis
of polysome-bound mRNA, the levels of proteins corresponding
to representative genes within the IPA and GO networks described
above (Figs. 2–5) were increased after irradiation of NSC11 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

Discussion
In the study reported here we used polysome proﬁling to deﬁne
the radiation-induced translatome of three GSC lines. After exposure to a clinically relevant dose of 2 Gy, each GSC line contained a
substantially greater number of genes with increased as compared

with decreased translational activity (i.e., polysome-binding). In
the absence of apoptosis as the mode of radiation-induced GSC
death (17), an increase in an energy-consuming event such as gene
translation suggests that it may contribute to GSC survival after
irradiation, a situation consistent with the posttranscriptional
operon model (38) in which functionally related genes are
translated in a coordinated manner. To investigate the applicability of this model to GSC radioresponse, we used IPA and GSEA
to predict potential cellular processes affected by the IR-induced
changes in gene translation, which were then validated at the
biochemical level. Thus, rather than determining the levels of
corresponding proteins as an approach to validating microarray
analysis of polysome-bound RNA, given the multiple regulatory
points within a network or process, this strategy was aimed at
determining the functional consequences of the IR-induced GSC
translatome.
If the changes in gene translation promote cell survival after
irradiation, then networks and pathways associated with the DNA

damage response would be expected to increase. As shown in
Fig. 2, this was the case in analysis of the IR-induced GSC
translatome. However, additional functions were detected in the
translatome analyses that have not been typically associated with
radioresponse. Along these lines, the IPA-based identiﬁcation of
eIF4E activation suggested that IR enhances cap-dependent translation. Of note, radiation increased eIF4E binding to >1,000
unique transcripts, including many implicated in DNA replication, recombination, and repair, and knockdown of eIF4E enhanced the radiosensitivity of a pancreatic tumor cell line (26).
Given that the majority of mRNAs in eukaryotic cells are translated in a cap-dependent manner, it would seem that this process
would be required for modiﬁcations in the translatome. Previous
studies showed that eIF4F-cap complex formation after IR was
reduced in a murine ﬁbroblast cell line (39), increased in a normal
human breast epithelial cell line (40), and unaffected in the
human breast tumor cell line MDA-MB-231 (26). As shown here,
IR increased cap-complex formation in each of the GSC lines

indicative of increased cap-dependent translation, as predicted
by translatome analysis. A critical regulator of cap-dependent
translation is mTOR; its inhibition with INK128 reduced the
repair of IR-induced DNA DSBs as expressed by the slower
dispersal of gH2AX foci and enhanced IR-induced cell killing,
consistent with a determining role for cap-dependent translation
in cellular radioresponse. However, as shown in Fig. 3B, INK128
not only prevented the IR-induced increase in cap-complex formation in GSCs but also reduced basal levels. Formation of the
eIF4F–cap complex is a ﬁnal and rate-limiting step in gene
translation reﬂecting a culmination of the upstream regulatory
events that comprise the posttranscriptional infrastructure. Thus,
it is unclear at this point whether an increase in cap-binding or
simply the maintenance of basal cap-binding activity is necessary
for IR-induced translational control. Although the speciﬁc role of
mTOR in the IR-induced translational control of gene expression
in GSCs remains to be determined, the data presented suggest that
it can serve as a target for glioblastoma radiosensitization.
Analysis of the IR-induced translatome also suggested that the
Golgi apparatus participates in the radioresponse of each of the

www.aacrjournals.org

three GSC lines. A recent study by Farber-Katz and colleagues
(36) reported that irradiation of a variety of cell lines results in
Golgi dispersal, which they attributed to the DNA-PK–mediated phosphorylation of GOLPH3, an oncogene that functions
in the secretory pathway of the Golgi (41). It was also shown
that knockdown of GOLPH3 enhanced and its overexpression
reduced the sensitivity in HeLa cells to the DNA-damaging
agent doxorubicin, suggesting that Golgi dispersal contributes
to cell survival. As shown here, IR induced Golgi dispersal in
each of GSC lines, which was essentially eliminated by the
mTOR inhibitor INK128. Although the interaction between
DNA-PK and GOLPH3 was not evaluated, these results suggest
that cap-dependent translation is critical to the IR-induced
Golgi dispersal in GSCs. The speciﬁc mechanism through which
Golgi dispersal contributes to radioresponse remains to be
determined. However, one possibility may involve modiﬁcations in protein processing and delivery necessitated by the IRinduced changes in gene translation.
In addition to fundamental components applicable to all
GSCs, it is likely that their radioresponse also involves cell

line–speciﬁc aspects. Analysis of the IR-induced translatomes of
the individual GSCs suggested that such cell line speciﬁcity
applied to mitochondria. This would actually be consistent with
the literature in that IR has been reported to increase (42, 43),
and decrease (44, 45) mitochondrial function. The processes
determining whether IR affects mitochondrial function have
not been deﬁned. However, the data presented here suggest that
the type of mitochondrial response to IR is, at least in part,
determined by translational control, as reﬂected by the IR translatomes of the three GSCs.
Because IR-induced polysome proﬁles cluster according to the
tissue of origin (28), to investigate the signiﬁcance of radiationinduced translational control of gene expression, the study
described here focused on a set of three GSC lines. With respect
to validating translational control of gene expression as deﬁned by
microarray analysis of polysome-bound mRNA, we previously
showed a correlation with changes in corresponding proteins in
established glioma cell lines (11), a correlation also shown in this
study (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, although a necessary
starting point, such measurements do not establish a functional
role for translational control in cellular radioresponse. To determine whether the IR-induced modiﬁcations in the translatome are
of biologic consequence, we analyzed the affected genes in terms
of cellular processes and pathways. While deﬁning functional
effects, this approach accounted for the ability of any number of
proteins to inﬂuence a given process and the heterogeneity
between GSC lines. The data presented indicate that IR-induced
translational control plays a role in regulating a number of cellular

processes that are likely to inﬂuence cell survival, which implicates
the translational control of gene expression as a fundamental
component of radioresponse and a potential source of targets for
tumor radiosensitization.
