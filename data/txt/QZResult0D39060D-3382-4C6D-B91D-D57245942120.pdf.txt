Abstract
EGF receptor (EGFR) promotes tumor growth as well as radio- and chemoresistance in various human
malignancies including squamous cell carcinomas (SCC). In addition to deactivation of prosurvival signaling,
cetuximab-mediated EGFR targeting might concomitantly induce self-attenuating signaling bypasses. Identiﬁcation of such bypass mechanisms is key to improve the efﬁcacy of targeted approaches. Here, we show great
similarity of EGFR signaling and radiation survival in cetuximab-treated SCC cells grown in a more physiologic
three-dimensional extracellular matrix and as tumor xenografts in contrast to conventional monolayer cell
cultures. Using phosphoproteome arrays, we observed strong induction of JNK2 phosphorylation potentially
resulting from cetuximab-inhibited EGFR through c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK)-interacting protein-4 (JIP-4), which
was identiﬁed using an immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometric approach. Inhibition of this signaling bypass by
JIP-4 or JNK2 knockdown or pharmacologic JNK2 inhibition enhanced cetuximab efﬁcacy and tumor cell
radiosensitivity. Our ﬁndings add new facets to EGFR signaling and indicate signaling bypass possibilities of
cancer cells to improve their survival on cetuximab treatment. By deactivation of cetuximab–self-attenuating
JNK2-dependent signaling, the cytotoxicity, and radiosensitizing potential of cetuximab can be augmented.

Introduction
The EGF receptor (EGFR) belongs to the ErbB family of
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; ref. 1).
Because of increased activity and/or expression in human
malignancies and its role in, for example, cell proliferation,
migration, and invasion, EGFR emerged as a potent molecular
target (2–4). On binding of ligands, such as EGF or amphiregulin, EGFR dimerization results in RTK autophosphorylation
and channeling of mitogenic signals predominantly via the
Ras-extracellular signal–regulated kinase (ERK), Akt, and
c-jun-NH2-kinase (JNK) pathway (1).
Preclinical work showed the effectiveness of pharmacologic
inhibitors and antibodies against EGFR in tumor cells from
head and neck, lung, colon, and other cancers (3, 5–10).
Cetuximab, for example, is approved for use in combination

with radiotherapy for treatment-na€ve patients with locally
advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
(HNSCC) and as monotherapy for recurrent or metastatic
HNSCC (11, 12). These trials showed signiﬁcantly increased
rates of both locoregional control and overall survival.
Despite this clinical success, escape- or efﬁcacy-attenuating
mechanisms in response to cetuximab treatment have been
widely neglected. Recent studies suggested EGFR ubiquitination, cooperative EGFR-Src family kinase interactions, ErbB2
signaling, and p53 are involved in reduced cetuximab efﬁcacy
in colorectal or non–small cell lung cancer cell lines (13–16). As
our understanding of EGFR signaling in cancer is still marginal
and obviously tumor type-dependent, it is of high clinical
relevance to elucidate escape mechanisms of cetuximab in
HNSCC by taking into consideration how HNSCC cells grow in
vivo. Our own work and work from others have shown that 3dimensional (3D) growth conditions are more physiologically
relevant with regard to cell morphology, gene and protein
expression patterns, protein–protein interactions, and intracellular signaling as well as response to irradiation and chemotherapeutics relative to conventional 2D monolayer cell
cultures (17–26).
In the present study, we sought to elucidate the nature of
EGFR signaling in more detail and evaluate whether cetuximab
mediates differential cytotoxicity and radiosensitization in
squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells grown in 3D versus
2D. In a systematic comparison of different growth conditions,
we show signiﬁcant similarity of EGFR, ERK1/2, and Akt
phosphorylation in SCC cells grown in 3D extracellular matrix

cetuximab plus radiotherapy (7, 9), cetuximab radiosensitized cells in a 3D, but not 2D, environment. Using phosphoproteome arrays, we observed strong induction of JNK2
phosphorylation potentially resulting from an interaction
between cetuximab-inhibited EGFR and JNK-interacting

acids (PAA) at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere containing 7%
CO2. Conventional tissue culture plates (BD Biosciences) were
used for 2D cell culture. For 3D cell culture, plates were coated
with 1% agarose (Sigma) to prevent cell attachment to the
bottom of the well. Cultrex 3D Culture Matrix (lrECM; Trevigen) was added to the cell-culture medium to obtain a ﬁnal
concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. Thereafter, 3D cultured cells were
covered with supplemented DMEM.

ﬁxation with 80% ethanol and Coomassie staining (Merck), cell
colonies with more than 50 cells were counted microscopically
(Fig. 2A). Plating efﬁciencies were calculated as follows: number
of colonies formed/number of cells plated. Surviving fractions
(SF) were calculated as follows: numbers of colonies formed/
(numbers of cells plated (irradiated)  plating efﬁciency (unirradiated). Each point on survival curves represents the mean
surviving fraction from at least 3 independent experiments.

Radiation exposure
Irradiation was delivered at room temperature using
single doses of 200 kV X-rays (Yxlon Y.TU 320; Yxlon) ﬁltered
with 0.5-mm Cu. The absorbed dose was measured using a
Duplex dosimeter (PTW). The dose-rate was approximately
1.3 Gy/min at 20 mA, and applied doses ranged from 0 to 6 Gy.

3D colony formation assay
Clonogenic survival under 3D conditions was determined in
a 3D colony formation assay as published previously (26, 27).
Asynchronously and exponentially growing single cells were
mixed with 0.5 mg/mL lrECM and placed in 96-well plates.
LrECM was covered with cell-culture medium. After 24 hours,
cetuximab was added to the medium to ﬁnal concentrations of
0 to 5 mg/mL. After 24 hours, irradiation (0–6 Gy) was carried
out. Cetuximab remained in the cell-culture medium for the
entire growth period. Incubation of cells with the JNK inhibitor
SP600125 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was carried out for 26.5
hours, whereby the inhibitor was added 30 minutes before
cetuximab and was withdrawn 2 hours after irradiation by
washing 5 times using DMEM. Cells were cultured for 9 days
(A431 and UTSCC14), 11 days (FaDu), or 14 days (UTSCC5). Cell

50 cells) were counted microscopically without ﬁxation or
staining (see Fig. 2A). Plating efﬁciencies and surviving fractions were calculated as described earlier. Synergism was
calculated as recently published (28) using the following
formula: S ¼ r(a, b)  r(a0, b)  r(a, b0).
Total protein extracts and Western blotting
Asynchronously and exponentially growing 2D cell cultures
were rinsed with ice-cold 1 PBS before harvesting total
proteins by scraping with modiﬁed radioimmunoprecipitation
assay (RIPA) buffer [50 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 7.4), 1% NonidetP40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche), 1 mmol/L
NaVO4, and 2 mmol/L NaF]. In 3D, asynchronously and exponentially growing cells were lysed within the lrECM using
modiﬁed RIPA buffer. Homogenization of lysates was accomplished by 4 passages through a 25-gauge needle followed by
centrifugation. Samples were stored at 80 C. Protein concentration of 2D lysates was measured using the BCA assay
(Thermo Scientiﬁc). SDS-PAGE, transfer of proteins onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher und Schuell), probing, and
detection of speciﬁc proteins with indicated antibodies and
SuperSignal West Dura Extended Duration Substrate (Thermo
Scientiﬁc) was carried out as described previously (27).
siRNA transfection
MEK1 siRNA (sequence: 50 -GGAGCUAGAGCUUGAUGAGtt-30 ), JNK2 siRNA (sequence: 50 -GGGAUUGUUUGUGCUGCAUtt-30 ), EGFR siRNA (sequence: 50 -GGCACGAGUAACAAGCUCAtt-30 ), and JIP-4 siRNA (sequence: 50 -GCAGUAUCGUCAGGUAAAAtt-30 ) were obtained from Applied Biosystems. The nonspeciﬁc control siRNA (sequence: 50 GCAGCUAUAUGAAUGUUGUtt-30 ) was from Euroﬁns MWG
Operon. siRNA transfection was conducted as published
(17). Twenty-four hours after delivery of 20 nmol/L siRNA
using oligofectamine (Invitrogen), cells were plated on 2D
cell-culture plastic or embedded in 3D lrECM. A 1- or 24hour incubation with cetuximab (0–5 mg/mL) was followed
by irradiation. Colony formation assays and Western blotting were carried out. Efﬁcient MEK1, JNK2, EGFR, and JIP-4
knockdown was conﬁrmed by Western blotting.
3D immunoﬂuorescence staining
Immunoﬂuorescence stainings of 3D cultured cells were
carried out as recently published (8). Three-dimensionally cultured cells were treated with cetuximab (0–5 mg/mL) for 1 hour
and then ﬁxed with 3% formaldehyde/PBS in lrECM for 15
minutes. After transfer to a centrifugation tube, cells were
permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100/PBS for 10 minutes,
washed with PBS, and blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 30 minutes.
Staining of c-Jun, c-Jun S63, EGFR, and JIP-4 was carried out with
speciﬁc antibodies for 2 hours. After washing with 1 PBS,
secondary antibodies and/or Alexa594 phalloidin were added for
1 hour. Cells were washed and transferred onto microscopic
slides before covering with Vectashield/DAPI mounting medium (Alexis) and cover slip. Images were acquired using a
confocal laser scanning microscope LSM 510meta (Zeiss). Colocalization was measured using the LSM510 software (Zeiss).

Animal experiments
The experiments were carried out using 7- to 14-week-old
male and female NMRI (nu/nu) mice obtained from the
pathogen-free animal breeding facility (Experimental Center,
Medical Faculty, Technische Universit€at Dresden, Germany).
Animal facilities and experiments were approved according to
the institutional guidelines and the German animal welfare
regulations. For the experiments, small tumor pieces were
transplanted subcutaneously into the right hind-leg as published previously (7, 26, 27). At a tumor size of 7 mm in
diameter, mice were treated with 1 mg cetuximab (Erbitux)
intravenously in a volume of 0.2 mL. Please see Supplementary
Experimental Procedures for detailed description.
Phospho-speciﬁc protein microarray analysis
The Phospho Explorer Antibody Microarray was conducted
by Full Moon BioSystems Inc. Whole-cell lysates from 2D and
3D FaDu cell cultures treated with cetuximab (5 mg/mL; or
untreated controls) were harvested after 1 hour using Protein
Extraction Buffer (Full Moon BioSystems Inc.) and transferred
to Full Moon BioSystems Inc., on dry ice. The array consists of
1,318 phospho-speciﬁc antibodies. In brief, proteins were
labeled with biotin and placed on preblocked microarray
slides. After washing, detection of total and phosphorylated
proteins was conducted using Cy3-conjugated streptavidin.
Expression of phosphorylated proteins was normalized to
corresponding total protein expression. Fold change was calculated as follows: phosphorylation of cetuximab-treated cells/
phosphorylation of untreated cells. This experiment was carried out once. Where indicated, protein phosphorylation data
were conﬁrmed by Western blotting.
Immunoprecipitation after cetuximab treatment
Cetuximab-treated (5 mg/mL) or untreated 3D grown cells
were lysed with cell lysis buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented
with complete protease inhibitor cocktail as described (26, 27).
Protein-G-Agarose beads (Sigma) were incubated with nonspeciﬁc mouse IgG antibody overnight. Protein lysates were
added to the beads and incubated overnight. Cetuximabbound EGFR was pulled down by interaction of cetuximab
with the beads, and not by the nonspeciﬁc mouse IgG. After
washing of the beads, SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were
carried out as described earlier.
Immunoprecipitation and sequential mass spectrometry
Three-dimensionally grown cells were lysed with cell lysis
buffer (Cell Signaling) supplemented with complete protease
inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Protein-G-Agarose beads (Sigma)
were incubated with EGFR antibody or nonspeciﬁc mouse IgG
antibody overnight. Protein lysates were added to the beads and
incubated overnight. After SDS-PAGE, gel ﬁxation, and Coomassie (Merck) staining, mass spectrometric analysis was carried
out at the Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and
Genetics Mass Spectrometry (MPI-CBG MS) Facility (Dresden,
Germany) as published (26, 27). Proteins were ﬁrst in-gel
digested with trypsin as described in ref. 29 and the liquid

Ultimate nanoLC systems (Dionex) interfaced online to a LTQ
Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo-Fisher Scientiﬁc)
via a robotic nanoﬂow ion source TriVersa (Advion BioSciences
Ltd.) as described in ref. (29). Acquired spectra were searched
against human international protein index (IPI) protein databases. Spectra were matched by MASCOT software (Matrix
Science, v.2.2.0) under the following settings: mass tolerance
was set as 10 ppm for precursor and 0.5 Da for fragmentation
spectra; variable modiﬁcations: propionamide (C), N-acetylation
(Protein N-terminus), oxidation (M); enzyme: trypsin; and 1
missed cleavage allowed. The result was evaluated by Scaffold
software (Proteome Software) under the following settings:
minimal number of peptides was 2; minimal peptide and protein
probabilities were 95% and 99%, respectively.

Results
Growth conditions severely impact on EGFR
phosphorylation and signaling
We ﬁrst characterized and compared EGFR expression and
phosphorylation of 3 SCC cell lines in 3D lrECM versus
conventional monolayer cultures versus tumor xenografts (Fig.
1A). Intriguingly, patterns of EGFR expression and EGFR
tyrosine (Y)1068 and Y1173 as well as ERK1/2 threonine (T)
202/Y204 phosphorylation showed great similarity in FaDu and
UTSCC14 cells grown in 3D lrECM and in vivo (Fig. 1B and C).
Akt T308 phosphorylation was higher in 3D than in 2D, but only
matched with in vivo levels in FaDu cells (Fig. 1B and C). The
extreme levels of EGFR phosphorylation in A431 cells might be
causative for only small detectable differences of proteins of
interest under the different growth conditions (Fig. 1B and C).
To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst comparative analysis of
EGFR signaling in HNSCC cells growing in 3D, in vivo, or as a

Only proteins with modiﬁed phosphorylation of 67% or less
and 150% or more from cetuximab-treated 3D FaDu cell
cultures were listed according to pathway after normalization
to untreated controls (Figs. 3A, 4A). In general, the data showed
reduced phosphorylation at kinase-stimulating sites as well as
increased phosphorylation at kinase-inhibitory sites in
response to cetuximab (Figs. 3A, 4A). Detection of total phosphotyrosine and phosphothreonine levels supported this
observation (Supplementary Fig. S4). For EGFR, we found
reduced phosphorylation at 5 of 10 examined EGFR sites, that
is, Y1068/1069 and Y1172/1173; borderline changes at 4 sites;
and induction at EGFR Y1016 (Fig. 3A). Selective conﬁrmatory
Western blotting analysis of basal and cetuximab-related
EGFR phosphorylation patterns showed approximately 70%
reduction in EGFR phosphorylation at particular sites independent from growth conditions; however, for 3D cell culture
and tumor xenograft, the reduction was signiﬁcant (Fig. 3B and
C). Moreover, inhibition of EGFR resulted in decreased phosphorylation levels of downstream mitogen-activated protein
kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways including MAPK kinase
[MAP—ERK kinase (MEK); 	45% reduction in Western blot
analysis], ERK1/2 (	80% reduction in Western blot analysis), E
twenty-six-like transcription factor 1 (Elk1), MAPK-interacting
kinase 1 (MNK1), and cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB; Fig. 3). Interestingly, changes in growth factor

monolayer, providing strong support for 3D lrECM-based cell
cultures as correlates to in vivo growth conditions.
Cytotoxicity and radiosensitizing potential of cetuximab
The inhibitory potential of cetuximab under serum starvation and subsequent EGF stimulation was conducted. EGF
exposure resulted in enhanced EGFR Y1173 and Y1068 phosphorylation in FaDu and UTSCC14 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Next, we analyzed the effects of cetuximab on clonogenic
survival of 3D- and 2D-grown SCC cell lines and found great
intercell line variances independently of 3D or 2D culture
settings (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Table S1). In contrast
to monolayer cell cultures (Fig. 2A and C), 3D lrECM cell
cultures were signiﬁcantly (P < 0.01) and concentration-dependently radiosensitized by cetuximab (Fig. 2A and D), whereas
apoptosis induction was negligible in this context (Supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). From these results, we conclude
cetuximab efﬁcacy alone to be independent of growth conditions in contrast to combined cetuximab/irradiation treatment regimens in SCC cell lines.
Phosphoproteome modiﬁcations after cetuximabmediated EGFR inhibition
Next, we sought to identify the modiﬁcations of the intracellular signaling network resulting from cetuximab treatment
by using a phosphoproteome array technique. This array
contains 1,318 well-characterized phospho-speciﬁc antibodies.

EGFR/JIP-4 Interaction

receptor–bound protein 2 (Grb2), Ras, and Raf were not
observed. EGFR blocking also led to signiﬁcant dephosphorylation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt in 3D and
in vivo by 80% and 70%, respectively, in contrast to 2D (Fig. 4;
according to www.phosphosite.org). Besides kinase-deactivating phosphorylations, we detected hyperphosphorylation of
Rac-MEK4/7-JNK-c-Jun signaling components in both 3D
HNSCC cell cultures and tumor xenografts upon cetuximab
treatment relative to untreated controls (Figs. 4 and 5A–C).
Intriguingly, phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and c-Jun S63 was
highly signiﬁcantly induced upon cetuximab treatment by
approximately 600% and 250%, respectively, in 3D and in vivo
as compared with 2D (Fig. 4B and C). The presented phosphoproteome data in 3D lrECM HNSCC cell cultures suggest
cetuximab causes a distinct EGFR dephosphorylation pattern
that translates into selective inhibition of proteins associated
with the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt signaling cascade. Of
speciﬁc interest is the similarity of signal transduction events
in these 2 cascades in HNSCC cells grown in 3D lrECM and as
xenograft tumors. These ﬁndings support our supposition that

JNK2 depletion enhances cetuximab-induced
radiosensitization
Because of the context dependency of JNK with regard to antiand prosurvival effects, we next investigated whether the cetuximab-induced JNK2 hyperphosphorylation modiﬁes cetuximab
efﬁcacy (Figs. 4 and 5A). JNK2 targeting using siRNA or the
pharmacologic inhibitor SP600125 resulted in signiﬁcant cytotoxicity in 3D FaDu cell cultures (Fig. 5B and C; Supplementary
Fig. S5). While JNK2 depletion signiﬁcantly sensitized 3D-grown
FaDu cells to X-rays, combined cetuximab plus JNK2 depletion
showed additive effects in contrast to cetuximab plus MEK1
knockdown (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S3). Similar results
were obtained on SP600125 treatment (Fig. 5C). EGFR knockdown caused higher radiosensitization than cetuximab alone
and remained unchanged by additional cetuximab administration (Fig. 5D). Notably, EGFR depletion prevented cetuximabinduced JNK2 hyperphosphorylation, and JNK inhibition

6C). These data show a functional role of JNK2 in the radiation

be transduced by interaction of EGFR with JIP-4 (Fig. 6D).

abrogated cetuximab-dependent activation of c-Jun (Fig. 5D;
Supplementary Fig. S6). In cetuximab-resistant UTSCC5 cells,
supportive data were generated delineating JNK2 to be key for
radiosensitization by cetuximab (Supplementary Fig. S7 and
Supplementary Table S3). These observations show a novel link
between EGFR and JNK2 signaling and suggest this interaction
plays a critical role in the self-attenuating process that reduces
the radiosensitizing potential of cetuximab.

Discussion

JIP-4 connects EGFR to JNK2
By carrying out mass spectrometry on EGFR-immunoprecipitates, we identiﬁed a variety of interacting proteins (Supplementary Table S2). The most potent candidate found in
these immunoprecipitates from cetuximab-treated 3D FaDu
cell cultures that connects EGFR to JNK signaling was JIP-4
(Fig. 6A; Supplementary Fig. S8). The radiosensitization by JIP4 depletion was superimposable to that of cetuximab, and
cetuximab-induced JNK2 hyperphosphorylation was prevented (Fig. 6B; Supplementary Table S3). An enhanced recruitment of JIP-4 to cetuximab-inhibited EGFR was visualized by
immunoﬂuorescence staining and colocalization measure-

Understanding EGFR signaling in cancer is essential for
treatment optimization and individualization. In addition to
a plethora of novel molecular biology technologies, 3D cell
cultures have been postulated to better reﬂect in vivo growth
condition and, therefore, might be highly valuable to support
this endeavor. Here, we present data showing great similarity
in EGFR signal transduction events between 3D lrECM HNSCC
cell cultures and HNSCC tumor xenografts in contrast to
monolayer cell cultures. Effective EGFR inhibition by cetuximab elicited concentration-dependent cytotoxicity and radiosensitization. In our phosphoproteome analyses, we observed a
strong induction of JNK2 phosphorylation potentially resulting
from cetuximab-inhibited EGFR. Suppressing bypass signaling

EGFR/JIP-4 Interaction

via JIP-4 or JNK2 inhibition enhanced cetuximab efﬁcacy and
tumor cell radiosensitivity. These ﬁndings add new facets to
EGFR signaling with particular focus on resistance pathways,
which limit tumor cell eradication and radiosensitization.
As emphasized earlier (8, 18, 30–34), growth conditions
critically impact on growth factor receptor activity and downstream signaling offering a certain degree of plasticity for
bypass signaling. In cancer cells, these mechanisms may
considerably contribute to radio- and chemoresistance as well
as resistance to novel molecular agents. Our study presents
compelling data on the resemblance of EGFR-associated signaling in 3D lrECM cell cultures and corresponding tumor
xenografts. About the differences in EGFR phosphorylation in
3D versus 2D, the similarity in the cytotoxicity proﬁles of
cetuximab was unexpected. Importantly, radiosensitization
of 3D SCC cell cultures corroborated with tumor sensitization
of SCC tumor xenografts (7, 9) and improved locoregional
control and overall survival of patients with head and neck
cancer treated with combined radiotherapy and cetuximab
(11, 12). A mechanistic explanation for cetuximab-mediated
radioprotection of 2D-grown cells is currently lacking but
should take into consideration signal transduction events,
gene expression, and cell cycling (20, 21, 25).
In line with current knowledge (1), reduced phosphorylation of EGFR downstream signaling mediators such as
MEK, ERK1/2, and CREB as well as PI3K/Akt at kinaseactivating amino acid residues occurred in response to
cetuximab treatment. This compromised promitogenic and
prosurvival signaling and translated into signiﬁcant cytotoxicity and radiosensitization. Taking methodologic limitations into account, circumvention of EGFR proximal Grb2/
Ras/Raf signaling was unexpected. Instead, hyperphosphorylation/activation of Rac-MEK4/7-JNK-c-Jun signaling components, acting in a context-dependent manner, was found
in 3D HNSCC cell cultures and tumor xenografts on cetuximab treatment. By channeling into S63 phosphorylation of
the JNK2 downstream target c-Jun, we hypothesize JNK2-cJun activation to critically cooperate in an efﬁcacy-limiting
stress response to cetuximab.
The JNK family members serve in a multifunctional, environment-driven, and cell line/type-dependent manner (35, 36).
Among many factors, X-ray radiation is a well-known JNK
activator (36, 37). To prove whether JNK2 is mechanistically
involved in a cetuximab–self-attenuating reaction, siRNAmediated JNK2 depletion and pharmacologic JNK inhibition
(SP600125) were conducted. Although JNK2 inhibition conferred cytotoxicity and radiosensitization on its own, concomitant JNK2 knockdown plus cetuximab acted in an additive
manner. By using a cetuximab-resistant cell line, that is,
UTSCC5, we were able to conﬁrm the importance of JNK2 for
cetuximab-mediated radiosensitization.

One possible candidate connecting EGFR and JNK2 is JIP-4,
which we found by mass spectrometry of cetuximab–EGFR
immunoprecipitates. JIPs serve as scaffold proteins for interactions of different MAPK family members for distributing
biochemical cues through speciﬁc signaling cascades (38, 39).
By means of colocalization studies and gene silencing, we
provide evidence that JIP-4 is more intensively recruited to
cetuximab-inhibited, membranous EGFR and that JIP-4 depletion prevents cetuximab-mediated JNK2 and c-Jun hyperphosphorylation. Moreover, single JIP-4 knockdown provoked
radiosensitization similar to cetuximab alone and, importantly, elicited higher cetuximab efﬁcacy for radiosensitization in
the combined JIP-4 knockdown/cetuximab regimen.
In summary, our ﬁndings show a high degree of similarity in
EGFR downstream signaling in 3D lrECM cell cultures and
corresponding tumor xenografts. Because tumor cells are
thought to have multiple bypass possibilities under treatment,
the presented data suggest participation of JNK2 in cetuximabantagonizing signaling pathways via interaction between EGFR
and the scaffold protein JIP-4, thus providing important novel
insights into tumor cell responses and resistance mechanisms
to a targeted therapy that has already reached the clinic.
