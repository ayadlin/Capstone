Abstract

Author Manuscript

Many human malignancies lack de novo biosynthesis of arginine (Arg) because the key enzyme
argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1) is silenced. These tumors acquire ectopic Arg for survival,
and depleting this source by Arg-depleting recombinant enzyme ADI-PEG20 results in cell death.
Mechanisms underlying Arg auxotrophy in these tumors and how they respond to Arg-auxotrophic
stress are poorly understood. Here, we report that an immediate early event of Arg-auxotrophic
response involves ROS-mediated secretion of Gas6 which interacts with its receptor Axl and
activates the downstream Ras/PI3K/Akt growth signal leading to accumulation of c-Myc by
protein stabilization. Arg-auxotrophic challenge also transcriptionally upregulates c-Myc
expression which feedbacks to enhance Axl expression. c-Myc is a positive regulator of ASS1, but
elevated ASS1 feedbacks to suppress c-Myc and Axl. Our results revealed multiple interregulatory pathways in Arg-auxotrophic response consisting of Axl, c-Myc, ASS1 that regulate
Arg homeostasis and ADI-PEG20 sensitivity. These pathways provide potential targets for
improving the efficacy of treating Arg-auxotrophic tumors using Arg deprivation strategies.

INTRODUCTION

Author Manuscript

L-arginine (Arg) is a semi-essential amino acid. Malignant cells require sufficient amounts
of Arg for protein biosynthesis to sustain their highly proliferative activity. Arg can be de
novo synthesized from citrulline and aspartate by argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1).
ASS1 deficiency causes citrullinemia, a rare autosomal recessive disease 3. Alternatively,
Arg can be obtained from the extracellular milieu through cationic amino acid transporters.
It has been reported that subpopulations of various human malignancies in many different
lineages do not produce sustainable amounts of Arg and require extracellular Arg for
survival, because these tumors express very low levels of ASS112, 34. The Arg-degrading
recombinant enzymes, pegylated arginine deiminase (ADI-PEG20, hereafter ADI) which
digests Arg into citrulline and ammonia, and human arginase 1 which digests Arg into
ornithine and urea, induce Arg-auxotrophic stress, leading to cell death (see references in
reviews 12, 34). These recombinant proteins have been in various stages of clinical
development for targeting Arg-auxotrophic tumors 43. An important mechanism of Argauxotrophic response is induction of ASS1 expression, resulting in resistance to Argdeprivation treatment.

Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that induction of ASS1 expression by Arg deprivation involves
de-repression of HIF-1α by downregulation but upregulation of c-Myc, which replaces
HIF-1α to upregulate ASS1 expression 58. We further demonstrated that upregulation of cMyc follows the signal transduction mechanism involving Ras→PI3K/Akt/ERK→GSK3β,
where ERK phosphorylates c-Myc, resulting in c-Myc accumulation by suppressing
proteasomal degradation 59. However, how Arg-auxotrophic stress is sensed in activating the
Ras signal is not known.
We report here that ROS-related immediate-early activation of Gas6/Axl followed by a cMyc-mediated transcriptional upregulation of Axl is involved in Arg-auxotrophic response
leading to enhanced expression of ASS1. Elevated ASS1 expression provides feedback and
suppresses c-Myc and Axl expression, constituting a self-regulatory mechanism of Argauxotrophic management that has implications for targeted therapy of Arg-auxotrophic
tumors.

RESULTS
Activation of Axl in response to ADI in melanoma cells
To investigate whether activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) is involved in Argauxotrophic response that activates Ras signaling59, we used lysates of A2058 cells treated
with or without ADI for 15 min to probe an array of 42 anti-phosphotyrosine receptor
antibodies in duplicate and observed that Axl was the predominant RTK activated (Fig. 1A).
We confirmed this using Western blotting which demonstrated a dose-dependent activation

of Axl by ADI (Fig.1B). Activated Axl in A2058 cells can be seen as early as 5 min after
ADI treatment but disappears after 30 min of exposure (Fig. 1C). This transient induction of
Axl was also seen in A2058 cells grown in Arg-free medium (Fig. 1D). Activation of Axl by
ADI was also seen in another melanoma cell line SK-Mel-2 (not shown) and in breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-231 but the kinetics of induction was delayed and persistent through an
1-hr treatment (Fig. 1E). No activation of Axl and Akt was seen in A375 cells (Fig. 1F),
consistent with our previous observations for the non-inducibility of this cell line by ADItreatment 59. These observations revealed substantial heterogeneity in response to Argdeprivation in human cancer cell lines. Moreover, while no p-Axl was detectable in A2058
cells treated with ADI or grown in Arg(−) conditions after 30 min treatments, p-Akt levels
continued to increase thereafter, suggesting that activation of Akt is a downstream event.

Author Manuscript

To demonstrate the role of Axl in Arg-auxotrophic response, we introduced the dominantnegative Myc-tag Axl mutant (Axl-DN-Myc, K558R in the kinase domain). Overexpression
of Axl-DN-Myc abolished the ADI-induced Ras/Akt signal (Fig. 1G). Axl is a membranebound RTK with extracellularly located ligand-binding domain. A truncated form of human
Axl known as soluble Axl (sAxl) containing extracellular ligand-binding domains was found
in plasma of leukemia patients 8. sAxl acts as a “sponge” to neutralize Gas6 by preventing it
from binding to the native Axl receptor. Expression of sAxl suppresses Axl signaling
induced by ADI (Fig. 1H). These results demonstrated that Axl plays an important role in
Arg-auxotrophic response.
Gas6 secretion leads to Axl activation in response to ADI treatment

Author Manuscript

The ligand of Axl is Gas6 8. Because melanoma cells, including those described in this
study, express undetectable amount of Gas6 by Western blotting, we used MDA-MB-231
cells which express high amount of Gas6 and is also auxotrophic for Arg 59. Axl activation
can be ligand-dependent or -independent. Because the ligand-binding domain of Axl is
extracellularly located, ligand-dependent activation of Axl requires Gas6 externalization. We
treated MDA-MB-231 cells with ADI for different lengths of time. We found a timedependent reduction of cellular Gas6 (endo-Gas6) with correspondingly increased ectopic
Gas6 in culture media (ex-Gas6) (Fig. 2A). For Gas6 to interact with Axl, Gas6 has to be
enriched in plasma membrane. To demonstrate enhanced membrane association of Gas6 in
ADI treatment, we fractionated cell lysates into cytoplasmic (C), membrane (M), and
nuclear (N) fractions. Cross-contamination in these three fractions was minimal as
evidenced by the distributions of α-tubulin for cytosol, Na+/K+ ATPase for membrane and
lamin B for nucleus as markers. We found that ADI treatment resulted in Gas6 enrichment in
the membrane fraction, whereas p-Akt and c-Myc enrichment in the nuclear fraction (Fig.
2B). These results demonstrated that ADI triggers Gas6 release into medium to activate Axl.
The importance of Gas6 in Arg-auxotrophic response was further demonstrated using two
Gas6 shRNA showing that knockdown of Gas6 abolished Axl activation (Fig. 2C), whereas
overexpression of Gas6 enhanced Axl activation (Fig. 2D).
Gas6 has two important structural features for its bioactivity. The C-terminus contains “sexhormone-binding globulin” domain which binds to the Ig domains of the receptor. The Nterminus of Gas6 is rich in glutamic acids (Gla domain)49. The γ-hydroxyl groups of these

glutamic acid residues are posttranslationally carboxylated in a vitamin K-dependent
modification. We used the Gas6 inhibitor warfarin, which inhibits γglutamylcarboxyltransferase and prevents γ-carboxylation of Gas6 21. We found that
warfarin suppressed ADI-induced Axl activation (Fig. 2E). Combination of warfarin and
ADI exhibits additive cell-killing effects as determined by SRB (Fig. 2F) and apoptosis
(DNA fragmentation) assays (Fig. 2G).

Many small molecules have been developed to inhibit RTKs and some have been shown
against Axl, although no inhibitor has been demonstrated clearly Axl-specific 11. SKI-606
(bosutinib) is an FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved agent for treating
Ph+ CML that mainly targets Bcr-Abl and Src, and to a lesser extent, Axl 27, 56, 65. As proof
of principle, we found that SKI-606 suppressed ADI-induced Axl activation and its
downstream signal (Fig. 2H). SKI-606 enhanced ADI’s cell-killing capacity (Fig. 2I) by
enhanced apoptosis mechanism (Fig. 2J). Taken together, these results demonstrated that
Gas6/Axl are potential targets for Arg starvation therapy.
Elevated expression of Gas6/Axl in ADI-resistant cell lines

Author Manuscript

We previously established 5 independent ADI-resistant variants (ADIR) in A2058
background (A2058R1 – R5) that resist to ADI treatment 37 (Fig. 2K). All these ADIR
variants exhibited elevated Gas6 and Axl along with the downstream signals, Akt, ERK and
ASS1, their expression levels were not strictly correlated with Gas6 and p-Axl/Axl levels,
reflecting clonal heterogeneity among these cell lines (Fig. 2L) In addition, all ADIR cells
are sensitive to SKI-606 (Fig. 2M). Knockdown of Axl diminished these downstream signals
(Fig. 2N and Fig. S3) and rendered the ADIR cells sensitive to ADI treatment (Figs. 2O and
2P, and S4). These results further supported the roles of Gas6/Axl in Arg auxotrophic
response and in ADI resistance.
Gas6 secretion induced by ADI follows conventional protein translocation mechanism that
is regulated by ADI-induced ROS

Author Manuscript

Under non-stressed conditions, γ-carboxylation of Gla domain allows Gas6 to bind to
phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) at the inner-, cytoplasm-facing leaflet of the plasma membrane
under the control of P4-ATPases or flippases and plasma membrane scramblases 31, 54. In an
apoptotic cell, PtdSer is displayed on the extracellular membrane surface because of disable
of flippases and enhanced phospholipid scramblases 50, resulting in externalization of
Gas6 17, 36. To investigate whether Gas6 externalization follows unconventional membrane
translocation mechanism or by conventional protein translocation mechanism which requires
a N-terminal signal (leader) sequence that navigates secretory protein to the cell surface
through the vesicular secretion pathway via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi
apparatus. Unconventional secretory proteins lack signal peptides and their transport is not
affected by inhibitors to ER/Golgi 40. Using SignalP-20 program (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/
services/SignalP/), we found that Gas6 contains a 32-amino acid signal peptide sequence
located at the N-terminus (Fig. S5). We found that treating MDA-MB-231 cells with
brefeldin A (BFA) which is a potent inhibitor of protein secretion by inducing Golgi
dissembles 5, and golgicide A which is a highly specific inhibitor of Golgi BFA resistance

factor 1 47, suppressed ADI-induced Gas6 externalization (Fig. 3A). These results suggested
that ADI-induced Gas6 release follows a conventional secretory pathway.

Author Manuscript

Gas6 contains at many cysteine residues (amino acids 119, 124, 141, 142, 158, 164,
168,177, 283, 570 that could be involved in bisulfide linkages for Gas6 function 48. These
bisulfide bridges could be sensitive to oxidative regulation. We hypothesized that ADI
treatment generates ROS to promote Gas6 secretion. Because induction of Gas6 release by
ADI occurs within minutes, we preloaded MDA-MB-231 cells and A375 cells with the ROS
probe dihydrorhodamine for 30 min. We found a time-dependent increased ROS production
following ADI treatment in MDA-MB-231 cells is an immediate early event (Fig. 3B, left).
ADI treatment of A375 cells seems reduced ROS levels, i.e., a left-shift of the fluorescence
profiles (Fig. 3B, right). These findings are consistent with the differential inducibility of
Gas6/Axl by ADI between these two cell lines (Figs. 1E & 1F). Although the magnitudes of
ROS induction using this assay system were minor, the results are reproducible (3
experiments) and also are consistent with the recent published results using longer treatment
time of ADI (see below). We next investigated whether ADI-mediated oxidative status
affects Gas6 secretion. Treating MDA-MB-231 cells with antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC) reduced ADI-induced Gas6 release as well as endogenous Gas6 level, whereas
treating with pro-oxidants N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) or H2O2 promote Gas6 release and
activation of the Axl signal (Fig. 3C). These results suggested that ADI-induced Gas6
secretion is mediated by a ROS-related mechanism. While the precise mechanism how NAC
alone reduces Gas6 expression is unknown, but may be due to the unstable nature of Gas6
under reducing conditions (disruption of the disulfide bridge) because Gas6 is a redoxsensitive protein 32.

Author Manuscript

Shp2 is an integral part of the Gas6/Axl activation signal

Author Manuscript

To elucidate how Gas6/Axl activation transmits into its downstream Ras/Akt signals, we
performed immunoprecipitation (IP) of lysates from ADI-treated or -untreated cells with
anti-Axl antibody followed by Western blotting. While Gas6 was co-precipitated with Axl in
the untreated cells, ADI treatment enriched Gas6 association with Axl and the Src
homology-2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2) which has been
demonstrated to transmit activated RTK signal to Ras/PI3K/Akt 39 (Fig. 4A). To strengthen
these findings, we carried out similar experiment in a time-course manner. We found that
kinetics of Axl, Gas6 and Shp2 associations mirror the kinetics of p-Axl induction in MDAMB-231 cells (Figs. 4B and 1E). Likewise, Shp2 immunoprecipitates probed by Axl or
phorphorylated tyrosine (p-Tyr) antibodies in lysates prepared from a time-course treatments
of A2058 cells with ADI also follows the kinetics of p-Axl activation in this cell line (Figs.
4C and 1C). Similar results were obtained using anti-p-Tyr in immunoprecipitation followed
by Western blotting with anti-Shp2 and anti-Axl antibodies (Fig. 4C).
To demonstrate the role of Shp2 in ADI-induced Gas6/Axl signal, we used a Shp2-DN
which contains a catalytically inactive mutation (C459S). Expression of C459S-mutant
abolished ADI-mediated Ras/Akt activation (Fig. 4D). Similar results were observed using
an shRNA approach (Fig. 4E). Overexpression of wild-type Shp2 induces Akt activation

regardless of ADI treatment (Fig. 4F). These results demonstrated involvement of Shp2 in
activation of Gas6/Axl/Ras/Akt signaling in response to ADI.
c-Myc is involved in transcriptional regulation of Axl expression by ADI
Activation of Gas6/Axl to Arg-auxotrophic challenge occurs within minutes. However, we
found that longer challenge increased the expression of Axl and several downstream
effectors as determined by Western blotting (Fig. 5). Induction of Axl by ADI was also
observed at the mRNA levels measured by quantitative real-time PCR (Fig. 5B), suggesting
that transcriptional regulation is involved.

Author Manuscript

In examining the proximal Axl promoter sequence, we found three putative E-box sequences
located within −1495 nt from the transcriptional start site, designated E-box 1, E-box 2 and
E-box 3 from the 5’ side. We constructed reporter recombinants containing their respective
wild-type E box sequences and mutations at each of these boxes (Fig. 5C, underscored). We
transfected these recombinant DNA into A2058 cells and treated with ADI or grown them in
Arg-free medium. Fig. 5D shows that these treatments enhanced expression of the wild-type
reporter, but not in all the three mutants (mE1 etc), demonstrating that these E-boxes are
involved in transcriptional regulation of Axl by ADI. Since c-Myc is a transcriptional
regulator that interacts with E-box sequences, we hypothesized that c-Myc is involved in the
transcriptional regulation of Axl by ADI. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
demonstrated enhanced c-Myc binding to each of these E-boxes (Fig. 5E). Moreover,
depleting c-Myc using shRNA approach suppressed Axl induction by ADI in the reporter
assay (Fig. 5F) and in cultured cells (Fig. 5G). These results demonstrated that c-Myc
transcriptionally upregulates Axl expression under Arg-auxotrophic stress conditions.

The inter-regulatory network of c-Myc, Axl, and ASS1 in Arg auxotrophic response

Author Manuscript

We previously demonstrated that ADI treatment enhanced c-Myc accumulation by inhibiting
the proteasomal degradation mechanism 59. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we observed
that c-Myc mRNA was induced by ADI within 24 hr after ADI treatment (Fig. 6A). We
hypothesized that enhanced c-Myc mRNA levels by ADI is auto-regulated through the Ebox located −2274 nt at the 5’ side of c-Myc. We constructed reporter plasmids containing
wild-type E-box and the mutant form (Fig. 6B). While expression of the reporter in wildtype construct was induced in A2058 cells under Arg-deprivation conditions, mutation at
this site reduced the expression levels (Fig. 6C). Knockdown of c-Myc in the transfected
cells also diminished levels of reporter induction under these treatments (Fig. 6D).
Furthermore, a ChIP assay demonstrated enhanced binding of c-Myc to the E-boxes located
at the c-Myc promoter and ASS1 promoter (positive control) (Fig. 6E). These results
demonstrated that ADI-induced c-Myc expression is transcriptionally auto-regulated itself.
ADI-induced c-Myc expression moves forward to induce ASS1 expression 58, 59. Using a
transfection approach, we observed that overexpression of ASS1 can feed-back to limit cMyc and Axl expression in Western blotting assay (Fig. 6F). Suppression of c-Myc and Axl
expression by the elevated ASS1 is transcriptionally regulated as demonstrated by ChIP
assay which shows reduced bindings of c-Myc to the E-boxes located in their respective
promoters (Fig. 6G), and by reporter assay using Myc-2791-Luc and Axl-1495-Luc

reporters, respectively (Fig. 6H). Taken together, these results support feedback regulation of
c-Myc and Axl by ASS1.
Reduced Gas6/Axl expression is associated with Arg-auxotrophy in melanoma cells

Author Manuscript

The above results suggest that deficiency of Gas6/Axl signal is an important mechanism of
Arg-auxotrophicity. To substantiate this finding, we performed Western analyses of Gas6,
Axl, and ASS1 in a panel of 15 melanoma cell lines (Fig. 7A, lanes 1-15). We found that,
except SB2 line (lane 15) which expresses detectable Axl, all other cell lines express much
reduced Axl. Expression of Axl in A2058, A375, and SK-Mel-2 could only be seen on
autoradiograms upon long-term exposure, whereas Gas6 and ASS1 expression was virtually
undetectable in all melanoma cell lines even upon prolong exposure using MDA-MB-231
breast and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell lines as references (Fig. 7A). Ectopic expression of
recombinant Gas6 in 6 randomly selected melanoma cell lines conferred Axl activation by
ADI in all these cell lines (Fig. 7B), demonstrating that Gas6 controls Arg-auxotrophic
response.
Correlations of Gas6, Axl, and ASS1 expression in melanoma tissues

Author Manuscript

We immunostained an array of 96 tissue specimens in duplicates from 48 individuals,
consisting of 4 normal skin, 4 benign hyperplasia, 2 basal cell carcinoma, 2 squamous cell
carcinoma, 24 primary melanoma and 12 metastatic melanoma. We found that Gas6
expression was virtually not detectable except one case with basal cell carcinoma. Axl
expression was also undetectable except low levels expression in one each of benign and
basal cell carcinoma, and 2 cases in primary melanoma. ASS1 expression was undetectable
in all the melanoma. Examples of Gas6, Axl and ASS1 IHC are shown in Fig. 7C. using
either MDA-MB-231 or kidney tissue as positive controls and A2058 cells as negative
control for these stainings. We also ruled out the contribution of melanin in IHC, because no
staining was observed using H&E staining. Collectively, these results demonstrated that
Gas6, Axl and ASS1 expression levels were low in human melanoma tissues, consistent with
the cell line data.

Author Manuscript

We next examined the expression levels of these genes in human melanoma tissues using the
data from the TCGA database. We found that the expression of Gas6, Axl and ASS1 in 103
skin cutaneous melanoma are significantly low, compared against the expression in ovarian
cancers as a baseline (data not shown). Moreover, we found that expression levels between
Gas6 and Axl mRNA (Fig. 7D, left) and between Gas6 and ASS1 mRNA (Fig. 7D, middle)
show significantly positive correlation (p = 0.003, p < 0.0001, respectively), whereas the
correlation between Axl and ASS1 mRNA had borderline significance (Fig. 7D, right,
p=0.045). For comparisons, we found significantly positive correlation between Gas6 and
Axl and between Gas6 and ASS1 mRNA (both p<0.0001), whereas no correlation between
Axl and ASS1 mRNA (p=0.12), in ovarian cancers (not shown). These results have
important implications of the Gas6/Axl/ASS1 axis in Arg auxotrophicity in malignant
melanoma. The poor correlation between Axl and ASS1 expression may suggest that
multiple mechanisms are involved in the regulation of these genes in other tumor types.
While little is known about Axl regulation, previous studies showed that multiple
mechanisms are involved in ASS1 regulation, including DNA methylation 55, Ca2+-

Elevated xpression of ASS1, c-Myc, Axl, and Gas6 mRNA in primary cultures derived from
ADI-PEG20-treated melanoma patients

Author Manuscript

We established two pairs of primary cultures from tumor biopsies of melanoma patients
prior to ADI-PEG20 treatment and after failure of the treatment from the previous clinical
study 13. We determined mRNA levels of ASS1, c-Myc, Axl and Gas6 by quantitative realtime PCR in these cells. We found significantly increased expression of all these mRNA in
cultured cells from ADI-resistant patients as compared correspondingly to those from
patients prior to the treatment. In both patients, ASS1 and c-Myc mRNA levels were
increased 2- to 8-fold, whereas Axl and Gas6 mRNA were increased 30 ~ 60% ( p < 0.05,
Fig. 7E). These results showed that within the limited available samples, elevated expression
of ASS1, c-Myc, Axl, and Gas6 expression seems to associate with treatment failure of ADI
in melanoma patients. Further studies using bigger samples are needed to validate this
finding.

DISCUSSION

Author Manuscript

Arg auxotrophy provides a metabolic vulnerability for targeted therapy using Arg
deprivation strategies in cancer chemotherapy. In this communication, we elucidated the
molecular pathways underlying how cancer cells respond to Arg auxotrophic challenge and
results are schematically depicted in Fig. 8. We demonstrated that ROS mobilization, which
stimulates the Gas6/Axl signal, is a very early event in Arg-auxotrophic response. Gas6 is a
vitamin K-dependent ligand for TAM receptor family which consists of Tyro3, Axl and
Mer 52, and Axl has the highest affinity for Gas6 among all 38. By interacting with its
receptors, Gas6 plays important roles in multiple physiological and pathophysiological
functions, including innate immunity, vasculature, atherosclosis, and thrombosis 35, 36. Gas6
and Axl have been found overexpressed in many human malignancies (reviewed in
references 35, 42, 60), and that overexpression of Axl is correlated with poor prognosis for
some cancers 15, 46. Moreover, upregulation of Axl has been demonstrated to develop
acquired resistance to many chemotherapeutics 42, 63, including inhibitors of epidermal
growth factor receptor 4, 14, 66, BRAFv600 (PLX4720) 26, and MEK (PD0325901 and
AZD6244) 6. The present results demonstrated that Axl is involved in regulation of ASS1
resulting in acquired resistance to Arg-deprivation chemotherapeutics, expanding the role of
Axl in cancer chemotherapy.

Author Manuscript

Activation of Gas6/Axl in Arg-auxotrophic response is stimulated by ROS. This occurs
within minutes. Additional support for the involvement ROS in Gas6/Axl signaling is
provided by the use of antioxidant NAC which suppresses the activation and pro-oxidants
which promotes the activation. It has recently been reported that prolong treatment (24 hr) of
MDA-MB-231 cells with ADI induces ROS and mitochondrial fragmentation, leading to
autophagy 44. Our results suggested that generation of ROS is an early event that drives Argauxotrophic response of Gas6/Axl activation. However, how Arg starvation elicits ROS
production requires further investigation.

Our results also demonstrated that activation of Axl signal by Arg starvation follows
biphasic kinetics, i.e., immediate-early activation by protein phosphorylation and subsequent
transcriptional upregulation. Transcriptional upregulation of Axl is mediated by c-Myc
which is also regulated by Arg-deprivation in a biphasic mode. Upregulated c-Myc then
feeds back to enhance Axl transcription, thereby amplifying the downstream Ras signal. In
the meantime, c-Myc also feeds forward to upregulate ASS1 expression (Fig. 8).
Upregulated ASS1 not only promotes Arg biosynthesis to relieve Arg-auxotrophic pressure,
but also feedbacks to downregulate c-Myc and Axl expression. This feedback mechanism
provides a self-guarding mechanism for ASS1 homeostasis control because elevated
expression of ASS1 may result in over-production of argininosuccinate, which is
cytotoxic 10. Furthermore, the self-regulatory mechanism of ASS1 may be an integral part of
metabolic flux in urea cycle regulation. Recent study demonstrated that several enzymes in
the urea cycle metabolism are co-regulated, including ASS1, argininosuccinate lyase, nitric
oxide synthase, and cationic amino acid transporter 1 by forming a supermolecular complex
that regulates metabolic flux 9. Collectively, our present results and those described
previously 37, 59 establish an intricate network consisting of inter-regulatory and selfregulatory loops that control Arg homeostasis (Fig. 8).

Author Manuscript

The multiple inter-regulatory loops place c-Myc in the center of the network, in which cMyc plays a positive role in upregulating Axl and itself under Arg-depleting stress but a
negative role of in regulating Axl and c-Myc when ASS1 expression is elevated. While the
exact mechanisms underlying these differential regulation mechanisms are not clear at this
time, however, this may not be surprising. C-Myc contains several highly conserved domains
that are interactive with various binding partners (TRRAP, TIP60, TIP48, p400, Skp2, etc)
that can function in positive and negative regulation modes 7, 20. The carboxy-terminal
region of c-Myc comprises the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper (bHLHz) domain which
can dimerize with other bHLHz members that are essential for Myc’s transcriptional
regulation through E-box DNA binding. Dimerization of c-Myc and Max confers positive
regulation 1, 33, whereas with MIZI (also known as ABTB1) mediates repression of target
genes 62. In addition, c-Myc can regulate rates of transcriptional elongation 45. Further
investigations are needed to elucidate how c-Myc performs bi-directional regulation in
controlling the overall Arg-auxotrophic response. In a broader aspect, because c-Myc is
involved in regulating 15 -20% of total genes in human genome 57, 61, Arg-auxotrophic
response is likely to have effects on global cancer metabolism. Of note is that mechanisms
of Gas6/Axl in Arg-auxotrophic involvement differ from those found in other amino acid
depletions such as histidine, leucine 29, 51 or asparagine 28 which involve the conserved
GCN2/elf2α and mTOR signaling 24, 30.

Author Manuscript

Our present findings may have the following important therapeutic implications. First, in
addition to previously demonstrated ASS1 induction 58, 59, present study demonstrated that
enhanced Gas6/Axl expression in cancer cell lines including those derived from melanoma
patients suggest that Gas6/Axl are likely important prognostic markers for the treatment
outcomes, although more studies are needed. Gas6 secretion is an early event of ADI
treatment and Gas6 concentration in human plasma is lower than 0.5 nM 18, 53, therefore,

We demonstrated that inhibitors to Gas6 (warfarin) and Axl (bosutinib) can suppress the
Arg-auxotrophic effects and enhance the cell-killing ability of ADI in Arg-auxotrophic cells.
Warfain (trade name: Coumadin, Jantoven, and Marevan) is a relatively safe FDA approved
anti-thrombosis and anti-thromboembolism drug. Moreover, targeting Axl using small
molecules 4, 22, 64 have been under clinical evaluations for cancer therapy. Third, these
treatment developments are particularly compelling, because they can target malignant
melanoma independently of BRAF mutations . Thus, our findings have important
implications for improving the treatment efficacy of targeted therapy of Arg-auxotrophic
tumors.

Inter-regulatory network in Arg-auxotrophic response. A, quantitative real-time PCR
measurement of c-Myc mRNA in A2058 cells treated with ADI for the time intervals as
indicated. Results are from three independent experiments. B, schematic of the c-Myc-2791luc construct in which wild-type and mutant E-boxes sequences are indicated. C, E-boxdependent activation of c-Myc promoter by ADI in A2058 cells. D, effects of c-Myc shRNA
on the c-Myc promoter activity by ADI in the reporter assay in MDA-MB-231 cells. Cells
were transfected with c-Myc shRNA or scramble shRNA (shScr) for 24 hr and treated with
ADI or grown in Arg-free medium for 24 hr. Luc activities were determined from cell
lysates. E, ChIP assay of c-Myc binding to the c-Myc promoter in 2058 cells treated with
Arg-deprivation conditions. Input, genomic DNA prior to IP. F, inhibition of c-Myc and Axl
expression by overexpressed ASS1 in A2058 and SK-MEL-2 cells. Cells were transfected
with 1 and 3 μg of ASS1-Myc-Tag recombinant for 24-hr. Expression levels of ASS1,
ASS1-Myc-tag, c-Myc, Axl, and Actin were analyzed by Western blotting. G, suppression
of c-Myc binding to the E-box and 3 E-boxes located at the c-Myc and the Axl promoter in
A2058 cells as determined by ChIP assay. H, inhibition of c-Myc (upper) and Axl (lower)
promoter activity by overexpressed ASS1 in transfection assay. The ASS1-expressing
recombinant was co-transfected with Myc-2791-Luc, Axl-1494-luc, or empty vector pGV-

luc into MDA-MB-231 cells. Expression of the reporters was measured and normalized to
those without overexpression ASS1 as 1. Error bars represent standard deviations from three
independent experiments. Melanoma cells A2058 or SK-MEL-2 cells were used here
because of their low basal ASS1 expression.

melanoma (lanes 1-15), MDA-MB-231 (lane 16) and SKOV3 (lane 17) cell lines. B,
activation of Axl by overexpressed Gas6 in six melanoma cancer cell lines. C,
immunohistochemical staining of the melanoma cell lines A2058 (negative control for Axl
and Gas6) and MDA-MB-231 (positive control) and Kidney tissue (positive control for Axl)
and representative melanoma tissue sections with Gas6, Axl and ASS1 antibodies as
indicated. H&E image is used to rule out the possibility of melanin involvement in IHC
staining. D. positive correlation between Gas6 and Axl (left) and between Gas6 and ASS1
mRNA (middle), and between ASS1 and Axl mRNA levels (right) from 103 cases of
cutaneous melanoma metastases in TCGA dataset. R, correlation coefficiency. E. elevated
expression of ASS1, c-Myc, Axl, and Gas6 mRNA in the primary cell cultures derived from
two melanoma patients (SE and GP) before and after failed by ADI treatments as determined
by quantitative real-time PCR. Data were presented as mean ± SD of three independent
experiments. *p < 0.05 by the student’s t-test.
