Abstract
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADTh) remains a mainstay of prostate cancer treatment, but its efﬁcacy is
bypassed by mechanisms that are not fully understood. In human prostate cancer cells, androgen glucuronidation, catalyzed by the two UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes UGT2B15 and UGT2B17, is the major
androgen inactivation pathway. In this study, we investigated the effect of ADTh on androgen glucuronidation to
evaluate its potential clinical utility for prostate cancer prognosis or therapy. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression
was evaluated in prostate cancer specimens from untreated or treated patients and in cell models of prostate
cancer exposed to clinically relevant antiandrogens. UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 protein levels in prostate were
increased after 5 months of ADTh when compared with specimens from untreated patients. UGT2B15 expression
remained elevated for up to 12 months, but UGT2B17 returned to initial levels as soon as after 6 months. Several
androgen receptor (AR) antagonists tested caused a dose- and time-dependent stimulation of UGT2B15 and
UGT2B17 expression and androgen glucuronidation in prostate cancer cell lines. The role of AR in these
regulatory events was conﬁrmed using AR-deﬁcient LNCaP cells, in which UGT2B attenuation reduced the
antiproliferative effects of AR pharmacologic antagonists. Through this combination of clinical and functional
investigations, our work revealed that ADTh stimulates a local androgen metabolism in prostate cells, establishing a foundation to evaluate the potential of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 as drug targets and/or molecular markers for
ADTh responsiveness and maintenance in prostate cancer. Cancer Res; 73(23); 6963–71. 2013 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer remains the second most frequent type of
cancer diagnosed worldwide, and the third leading cause of
cancer-related death in men in industrialized countries (1).
Prostate cancer is an adenocarcinoma originating from cells of
epithelial type, but displays morphologically and genetically
very heterogeneous properties (2). Androgens are among the
main factors controlling the initiation, maintenance, and
progression of prostate cancer (3). During carcinogenesis,
epithelial cells transform into a malignant phenotype, where
the androgen receptor (AR) selectively activates genes positively controlling cell viability to unrestraint epithelial cell

proliferation (3). For this reason, androgen deprivation therapy
(ADTh), also called "medical castration" or "hormone therapy,"
has become a ﬁrst-line treatment strategy for advanced prostate cancer (4). ADTh is achieved using gonadotropin releasing hormone (Gn-RH) analogs such as leuprolide, buserelin,
or goserelin (4), which inhibit testosterone synthesis (2).
This medical castration is often combined to antiandrogens
such as ﬂutamide, nitulamide, or bicalutamide (2). These AR
antagonists provide an additional blockade of androgen signaling by preventing AR activation by the locally synthesized
androgens. Symptomatic (improvement of quality of life) and/
or objective (serum prostate-speciﬁc antigen level normalization and measurable tumor response) outcomes to ADTh are
observed in approximately 80% of patients (5). However, the
duration of these improvements is highly variable, and prostate
cancer relapses in the majority of patients evolving to the
androgen-independent phenotype within 12 to 18 months of
therapy (5). The cancer is then commonly referred to as
castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), androgen independent, or hormone refractory (6). CRPC can transiently be
treated with alternative ADTh, but the ultimate options for
androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer lie in chemotherapy (5, 7).
The androgen axis continues to play a major role for the
progression of CRPCs (8), and a deep understanding of factors
affecting androgen inactivation in tumor cells is required. In

the prostate, the active hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT) is
extensively metabolized to inactive and easily excretable
androstane-3a-diol-glucuronide (3a-diol-17G) and androsterone–glucuronide (ADT-3G) derivatives (9, 10). These polar
metabolites are formed through a conjugation reaction called
glucuronidation, and correspond to the major androgen metabolic end products found in circulation in men (11, 12). In
humans, glucuronidation is catalyzed by the 19 functional
UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) enzymes (13). However,
in prostate, androgen glucuronidation only involves two
enzymes: UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 (14). Experimental inhibition of these enzymes signiﬁcantly improves the proproliferative properties of DHT in prostate cancer cells (14), suggesting
that they are major determinants for the androgen response.
Accordingly, positive associations were reported between
prostate cancer risk and a low-activity UGT2B15 allele or a
complete UGT2B17 gene deletion (15–19). On the other hand,
various studies illustrated the negative control that androgens
exert on UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression in prostate cancer
cells (14, 20, 21). These last observations establish the AR
regulatory pathway as a major mechanism for controlling
androgen glucuronidation. We therefore sought to test the
possibility that ADTh drugs affect UGT2B15 and/or UGT2B17
expression or activity in prostate cancer tumor samples and
cell models exposed to antiandrogens.

Materials and Methods
Materials
UDP-glucuronic acid and all aglycons were obtained from
Sigma or ICN-Pharmaceuticals Inc. R1881, 3a-Diol, DHT, ADT,
and DHT-glucuronide (DHT-G) were purchased from Steraloids. ADT-3-glucuronide and 3a-Diol-17-glucuronide were
provided by the Medicinal Chemistry Division of the "Centre
de recherche du CHU-Quebec" (21). Cell culture materials,
blasticidin and lipofectin, were purchased from Invitrogen.
Penicillin, streptomycin, and Iscove's Modiﬁed Dulbecco's
Medium (IMDM) were provided by Wisent, whereas puromycin, doxycyclin, bicalutamide, nilutamide, ﬂutamide, and RPMI
were purchased from Sigma. SYBR Green PCR Master Mix was
purchased from Applied Biosystem (Life Technologies). Protein assay reagents were obtained from Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc. The anti-calnexin antibody was purchased from Stressgen,
the anti-vimentin antibody was from GenScript, and the antiUGT2B15 and anti-UGT2B17 antibodies were described previously (22, 23). The secondary antibody against rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) was purchased from Amersham. The
chemiluminescence kit (ECL) was from Renaissance. SiRNA
probe for UGT2B15/UGT2B17 (Individual siGENOME duplex
D-020195-01) and Non-Target #1 were obtained from Dharmacon as already described in ref. 14.
Tissue banks
Tissues used for the microarray construction were from the
Vancouver Prostate Centre Tissue Bank (http://www.prostatecentre.com/our-research/core-facilities/biorepository), as
described in refs. 24, 25. Prostate samples were obtained from
31 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) donors, whereas prostate cancer samples were from 88 patients with advanced

6964

prostatic hyperplasia: 16 from untreated donors, 16 from
participants with CRPC, and ﬁnally 56 from patients having
received ADTh for 1 to 5 months (n ¼ 19), 6 to 8 months (n ¼
24), or 9 to 12 months (n ¼ 13; Supplementary SM1). Tissue
samples were extracted from the whole tissue after radical
prostatectomy, except CRPC samples that were obtained by
transurethral resection of the prostate (24, 25). The therapy
consisted of Gn-RH analogs (buserelin, leuprolide, or goserelin)
and antiandrogens (ﬂutamide, cyprosterone acetate, or bicalutamide) used alone or in combination. This protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards at the University of
British Columbia (Vancouver, BC, Canada), and the "Centre
hospitalier universitaire de Quebec" (Quebec, QC, Canada).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.
Tissue microarrays
Microarrays and immunohistochemical (IHC) stains were
obtained as previously described (24, 25), with formalin-ﬁxed
and parafﬁn-embedded 4-mm sections of the microarray, using
the previously described (22, 23, 26) polyclonal anti-vimentin
(positive control; 1:100 dilution), anti-UGT2B15 (1:300 dilution), and anti-UGT2B17 (1:150 dilution) antibodies (Supplementary SM2–8). The IHC staining (Supplementary SM2–8)
was scored by a pathologist (L. Fazli) for the level of immunoexpression on a scale from 0 to 3, wherein 0 was undetectable, 1 represented a faint or focal questionably present stain, 2
represented a stain of convincing intensity in a minority of
cells, and 3 represented a stain of convincing intensity in a
majority of cells.
Cell culture
Cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (cell authentication through short tandem repeat
proﬁling), used within 6 months following reception. LNCaP
cells were grown and treated in 10% FBS-supplemented RPMI
1640 medium. LAPC-4 cells were cultured in IMDM completed
with 7.5% FBS and 10 nmol/L R1881. Inducible AR-shRNA–
expressing LNCaP cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, puromycin (2.5 mg/mL), and blasticidin
(1 mg/mL), as reported in ref. 27. AR deﬁciency was obtained through a 48-hour pretreatment with doxycycline (DOX,
1 mg/mL), and the antibiotic was maintained for the complete
treatment duration as recommended (27). For RNA isolation,
2.5  105 LNCaP or 3.5  105 LAPC-4 cells were plated in each
well of 12-well plates. For glucuronidation assays and Western
blot analysis experiments, 8  106 LNCaP cells were plated
in 10-cm petri dishes. Cells were then treated for the indicated duration with vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol; 0.1% v/v], bicalutamide (DMSO), nilutamide (ethanol),
ﬂutamide (ethanol), R1881 (ethanol), and/or DHT (ethanol)
at the indicated concentrations. Knockdown of UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 expression was obtained using a UGT2B15/
UGT2B17 siRNA probe as already reported in ref. 14. Following transfection, cells were allowed 18 hours for recovery,
transferred in 96-wells plates, and exposed to vehicle (DMSO;
0.1% v/v) or bicalutamide (10 mmol/L) for 72 hours. Cell
proliferation was then ensured using the CellTiter 96 AQueous

Ablation Therapy Improves Androgen Glucuronidation in Prostate Cancer

Figure 1. Androgen ablation therapy modulates UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 protein levels in prostate tumors. UGT2B15 (A) and UGT2B17 (B) protein levels were
quantiﬁed in prostate tumors using IHC analyses of a tissue microarray with speciﬁc antibodies as illustrated in Supplementary SM2–8. Tumor samples were
from 31 BPH donors or 88 patients with advanced prostate cancer (Supplementary SM9), who were either untreated (n ¼ 16) or treated with ADTh for 1 to
5 months (1–5; n ¼ 19), 6 to 8 months (6–8; n ¼ 24), and 9 to 12 months (9–12; n ¼ 13), or with castrate-resistant tumors (CRPC; n ¼ 16). The staining intensity was
visually scored on a scale of 0 to 3 (see Materials and Methods), and values represent the mean  SEM of the scores obtained for each experimental
group (expressed relatively to untreated samples). Statistically signiﬁcant differences between experimental groups are indicated by asterisks when compared
with untreated and by ¥ when compared with BPH (Mann–Whitney test:  , P < 0.05;   , P < 0.01;    , P < 0.001; ¥, P < 0.05; NS, not signiﬁcant).

optical density determination (490 nm) was done with a
microplate reader Tecan Inﬁnitte M1000 as recommended by
the supplier (Promega).
Genotyping of the UGT2B17 gene copy number variation
Genomic DNA was isolated from LNCaP and LAPC-4 cells
using the ChargeSwitch gDNA Mini Tissue Kit (Life Technologies) and was then used as a template for UGT2B17 deletion
genotyping as previously described (25, 28).
RNA isolation and quantitative reverse transcription PCR
Total RNA was isolated according to the Tri-Reagent acid/
phenol protocol as speciﬁed by the supplier (Molecular
Research Center Inc.). The reverse transcription (RT) and
quantitative PCR reactions were performed as previously
described (25).
Western blot analyses and in vitro glucuronidation
Western blot analyses and in vitro glucuronidation assays
were performed as previously reported (14, 21, 22).
Statistical analyses
All data are presented as mean  SD, except for the IHC
intensity evaluation in which results are presented as mean 
SEM. Comparisons between experimental groups were performed by a two-tailed Student t test or a Mann–Whitney U test
for in vivo assessment of UGT levels using the JMP V7.01
software (SAS Institute).

Results
Androgen ablation therapy modulates UGT2B15 and
UGT2B17 protein levels in prostate tumors
According to our previous observation (25), untreated prostate cancer samples presented similar UGT2B15 and UGT2B17

www.aacrjournals.org

protein levels as in BPH samples (Fig. 1; Supplementary SM2–
8). However, when compared with BPH and untreated samples,
both UGT proteins were signiﬁcantly more abundant in tissues
from ADTh-treated patients for 1 to 5 months (Fig. 1; Supplementary SM2–5). The highest UGT2B15 expression was
observed after 6 to 8 months of treatment, and remained
signiﬁcantly higher than in untreated samples up to 12-month
therapy, even if a tendency to lower again was observed in these
last samples (Fig. 1A). In contrast, UGT2B17 protein levels were
reduced to basal levels (untreated) as soon as after a 6- to 8month period of treatment and remained stable for longer
exposures (Fig. 1B). In patients with CRPCs, both UGT2B15 and
UGT2B17 protein levels were not signiﬁcantly different from
those in untreated samples. In the IHC results obtained with
the positive control, vimentin (29) indicated that the quantiﬁcation of UGT2B protein levels was not biased by the tissue
preparation (Supplementary SM2–8).
Androgen receptor antagonism upregulates UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 expression and activity in prostate cancer
cell models
Ex vivo experiments were performed using prostate cancer
cell models and AR antagonists to further investigate the
effects and consequences of AR blockade on androgen glucuronidation (Figs. 2–4).
First, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 mRNA and protein levels were
quantiﬁed in LNCaP cells exposed to increasing doses of
bicalutamide (0.1 to 20 mmol/L) for 48 hours. The two UGTs
were dose-dependently increased at both mRNA and protein
levels (Fig. 2). Although the amount of UGT2B15 transcripts
was statistically increased in the presence of as low as 1 mmol/L
(Fig. 2A), UGT2B17 mRNA accumulation reached the statistical signiﬁcance only in the presence of 5 mmol/L bicalutamide
(Fig. 2B). In time course experiments, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17

transcripts were signiﬁcantly increased as soon as after 12
hours of treatment, and the maximal induction was reached
after a 48-hour exposure (Fig. 2C and D). A similar dose- and
time-dependent accumulation was observed for both UGT
proteins in Western blot analyses (Fig. 2). In vitro glucuronidation assays conﬁrmed that the bicalutamide-dependent
increase in UGT expression results in improved androgen
conjugation (Fig. 3). Indeed, LNCaP cells exposed to bicalutamide exhibited a dose- and time-dependent improved ability to
conjugate DHT (Fig. 3A and D), ADT (Fig. 3B and E), and 3adiol (Fig. 3C and F).
To ascertain that results from bicalutamide-treated LNCaP
cells were not cell type- or antagonist speciﬁc, additional
experiments were performed using the LAPC-4 cell model and
the other AR antagonists, nilutamide and ﬂutamide (Fig. 4). In
LAPC-4, bicalutamide dose- and time-dependently induced
UGT2B15 expression (Fig. 4A and B). UGT2B17 transcripts
were not detected in these cells. Actually, genotyping analyses
revealed that the UGT2B17 gene is absent in LAPC-4 (data not
shown), indicating their del/del phenotype for the previously
reported UGT2B17 CNV genotype (28). In both LNCaP and
LAPC-4 cells, bicalutamide and ﬂutamide were efﬁcient in
increasing UGT2B15 mRNA levels (Fig. 4C and D). A similar
response was also observed for UGT2B17 transcripts in LNCaP

6966

cells (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, nilutamide exhibited a cellspeciﬁc response with a signiﬁcant induction of UGT2B15
mRNA in LAPC-4 but not in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4C and D).
Furthermore, not only did nilutamide not improve UGT2B17
expression, but it caused a non signiﬁcant reduction of these
transcripts in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4C). This last observation is
consistent with the previously reported agonistic effects of
nilutamide in front of the mutated AR that is expressed in
LNCaP cells (30).
The androgen receptor mediates the bicalutamidedependent upregulation of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17
expression in LNCaP cells
AR contribution to the bicalutamide-dependent induction
of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression was ensured by using
LNCaP cells expressing a DOX-inducible anti-AR short hairpin
RNA (shRNA; Fig. 5; ref. 27). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed that DOX
treatment resulted in impaired AR expression and activity
(Supplementary SM9; ref. 27). Subsequently, native (DOX)
and DOX-activated cells (DOXþ) were cultured in the presence
of vehicle, bicalutamide (10 mmol/L), or the synthetic (R1881; 1
nmol/L), or natural (DHT, 10 nmol/L) AR activators (Fig. 5).
In native (DOX) cells, DHT, R1881, and bicalutamide
caused the expected down- (R1881 and DHT; ref. 21) or

two UGTs (Fig. 5). Similarly, the negative effect of DHT on
UGT2B15 expression was completely lost, as its mRNA levels
in vehicle- and DHT-treated DOXþ cells were not signiﬁcantly different (Fig. 5A). In contrast, UGT2B17 mRNA levels
were found signiﬁcantly more abundant in DHT-treated
than in vehicle DOXþ cells (Fig. 5B). Also surprising was
the observation that bicalutamide reduces UGT2B15 and
UGT2B17 mRNA levels in cells cultured with DOX (Fig. 5).
This last observation suggests that bicalutamide exerts
opposite effects on UGT genes' expression in the presence
of high (DOX) or low (DOXþ) AR levels. However, when
mRNA levels were compared with those quantiﬁed in bicalutamide-treated native cells, only the strong reduction in
UGT2B17 transcripts remained statistically signiﬁcant (Fig.
5B), indicating that the loss of AR mainly altered the
response of this enzyme to bicalutamide.
Nonetheless, the fact that AR knockdown abolishes or
reverses the effects of bicalutamide conﬁrms the role played
by this receptor in the antiandrogen-induced upregulation of
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression.
Knockdown of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 reduces the
antiproliferative properties of bicalutamide
We next evaluated whether induction of UGT2B15 and
UGT2B17 expression participates in the antiproliferative properties of bicalutamide (31). For this purpose, LNCaP cells were
transfected with a nontarget (siRNA control) or the antiUGT2B15/UGT2B17 siRNA probe (Fig. 6A; ref. 14), and then
exposed to vehicle (DMSO) or bicalutamide (10 mmol/L) for up
to 4 days (Fig. 6B). As expected (31), bicalutamide caused a
signiﬁcant 24.5% reduction of control cells' proliferation after 3
days of exposure. This reduction was further enhanced to
32.5% inhibition after 4 days (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, UGT2B-

deﬁcient cells were less sensitive to the antagonist and their
proliferation was only 15% and 22.5% reduced in the presence
of the drug after 3 and 4 days, respectively (Fig. 6B). Thus,
siRNA-mediated knockdown of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17
expression provoked 40% and 32% reductions of the antiproliferative effects of bicalutamide in LNCaP cells exposed to the
drug for 3 and 4 days, respectively.

Discussion
This study evidences a novel and incidental effect by which
androgen ablation drugs abolish the ability of carcinogenic
androgens to inhibit their own inactivation in prostate cancer
cells. This ﬁrst comprehensive analysis of AR blockade consequences for androgen glucuronidation identiﬁes the two
androgen-conjugating UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 enzymes as
ADTh-positive targets, and establishes the major contribution
of these effects to the antiproliferative properties of ADTh
drugs.
An interesting observation of the present study is the
differential manner in which the 2 UGT genes respond to AR
blockade in and ex vivo. These differences are thought to reﬂect
variations in the AR-dependent modulation of the two UGT
genes. Indeed, the fact that AR agonists/antagonists fail to
modulate UGT2B15 expression in receptor-deﬁcient cells,
while having inverse effects on UGT2B17 mRNA levels, suggests that alternative regulatory processes drastically modify
the AR-dependent modulation of UGT2B17 expression when
the androgen receptor is reduced. Although thorough investigations are required to fully grasp the mechanisms governing the molecular switch in the UGT2B17 response, it can be
envisioned that such UGT-speciﬁc processes may be derived
from nucleic acid differences in the transcriptional regulatory

Ablation Therapy Improves Androgen Glucuronidation in Prostate Cancer

Figure 6. UGT2B15- and UGT2B17-deﬁcient LNCaP cells are less sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of bicalutamide. A and B, LNCaP cells were
transiently transfected with a nontarget (control) or an anti-UGT2B15/UGT2B17 siRNA probe (UGT deﬁcient) using lipofectin for 6 hours, allowed
18 hours for recovery, and then exposed to vehicle (DMSO) or bicalutamide (10 mmol/L) for up to 2, 3, or 4 days (D). A, UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 mRNA
levels were quantiﬁed from total RNA through quantitative RT-PCR analyses and normalized with the housekeeping RNA 36B4. Values (mean  SD) are
expressed relatively to control (nontarget siRNA probe) set at 1. B, cell viability was determined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay Kit. Proliferation rate values (mean  SD) are expressed as number of cells per well. Percentages of reduction in cell proliferation were
determined. Statistically signiﬁcant differences between siRNA control and siRNA UGT2B15/B17-transfected cells are indicated by asterisks (Student t test:

regions of the UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 genes. Even if the two
genes share considerable sequence homology (9), previous
studies already illustrated that minor differences in their
proximal promoters are responsible for their differential
response to various regulatory pathways (32, 23). Such changes
actually exist within the AR response elements identiﬁed in
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 promoter sequences (20), and thus
may play a role in their isoform-speciﬁc response under low AR
levels. Other regulatory pathways may also be involved. For
example, EGF signaling, which downregulates UGT2B17
expression without affecting UGT2B15 in LNCaP cells (23),
has been identiﬁed as a transduction pathway involved in
prostate tumor growth (33, 34).
Beyond these mechanistic considerations, the present
results are of clinical signiﬁcance for prostate cancer progression, treatment, and diagnosis. In terms of tumor progression,
the desensitization of the UGT response to ADTh, as revealed
by the similar protein levels detected in untreated tumors and
CRPCs, suggests that the loss of UGT induction is involved in
tumors' transition to castration resistance. Even if resistant to
ablation therapies, CRPC progression remains dependent on
the androgen axis (8, 35). Because AR acts as a negative
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 gene–regulator (14, 20, 21), the loss
of UGT induction detected in vivo may actually reﬂect an AR
reactivation in resistant tumors. On the other hand, as
observed with UGT knockdown experiments, the induction
of androgen glucuronidation may contribute to the antiproliferative effects of AR antagonists. It is therefore tempting to
speculate that the loss of this induction is likely involved in the
phenotypic changes allowing tumor cells to proliferate in the
presence of low androgen levels, as observed in CRPCs (8). This
idea is supported by the inverse relationship existing between
UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 expression and androgen-dependent
prostate cancer cell proliferation (14) and by the strong inﬂu-

ence that UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 polymorphisms exert on
tissue androgen levels (36). The loss of UGT genes' sensitivity
may allow prostate cancer cells to maintain sufﬁcient DHT
levels to activate AR and its regulated genes in CRPCs (37, 38).
On the basis of these observations, one can conclude that the
UGT induction in short-term treated samples is an important
biochemical component of the initial ADTh beneﬁts (39).
Following on that point, it can be envisioned that UGT2B15
and UGT2B17 are actually underexploited therapeutic targets
for androgen deprivation therapies. Until now, antiandrogenic
approaches have been focusing on androgen biosynthesis and
activity (39). The present study validates the potential of
targeting glucuronidation to reduce active androgen concentrations in prostate cancer cells, thus providing a strong
rational for searching pharmacologic agents that stimulate
androgen glucuronidation in prostate cancer cells. However,
such an alternative strategy requires the identiﬁcation of ARindependent UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 gene–inducers.
The present work may also have a signiﬁcant impact in
terms of prostate cancer prognosis and diagnosis. Indeed,
the respective changes in UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 protein
levels in response to ADTh identify these two proteins as
potential biomarkers both for evaluating the responsiveness
to antiandrogen drug therapies and preventing resistance
occurrence. ADTh remains the cornerstone of systemic
treatments for locally advanced prostate cancer (38), and
biochemical predictors are currently needed to assess
whether additional treatments should be initiated (40).
Furthermore, patients with CRPC have a poor prognosis
and account for the majority of prostate cancer–related
deaths (39), thus being able to anticipate that ADTh resistance can be helpful in adapting treatment settings with new
effective antiandrogenic agents to prevent the development
of castrate-resistant tumors (39). A continuous follow-up of

UGT2B15 and/or UGT2B17 intraprostatic protein levels
from the time of diagnosis constitutes a potential approach
to evaluate therapy responsiveness, and measuring
UGT2B17 levels may also be helpful to anticipate the loss
of optimal ADTh effects in UGT2B17-positive patients, and
then initiate alternative therapeutics, even before the resistance occurrence.
The earlier-discussed diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities are mainly based on results from the tissue microarray
study, while largely supported by results from functional
investigations. However, sample heterogeneity is a major
problem in tissue array studies, especially in prostate cancer,
in which patients receive varied drugs or combination of drugs,
and the tumor areas are small and often surrounded by normal
cells (40). Therefore, the role of UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 as drug
targets and/or molecular biomarkers remains to be validated
through large and accurate clinical settings.
Nevertheless, the combination of clinical and functional
approaches used for the current investigation demonstrates
that ADTh drugs stimulate the local androgen metabolism in
prostate cells, and identiﬁes UGT2B15 and UGT2B17 as potential anticancer drug targets and/or biomarkers for androgen
ablation responsiveness and maintenance.
