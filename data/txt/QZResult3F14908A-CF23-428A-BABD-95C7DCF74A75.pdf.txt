Abstract
The therapeutic promise of microRNA (miRNA) in cancer has
yet to be realized. In this study, we identiﬁed and therapeutically
exploited a new role for miR-10b at the metastatic site, which
links its overexpression to tumor cell viability and proliferation.
In the protocol developed, we combined a miR-10b–inhibitory
nanodrug with low-dose anthracycline to achieve complete
durable regressions of metastatic disease in a murine model of
metastatic breast cancer. Mechanistic investigations suggested a
potent antiproliferative, proapoptotic effect of the nanodrug in
the metastatic cells, potentiated by a cell-cycle arrest produced

by administration of the low-dose anthracycline. miR-10b was
overexpressed speciﬁcally in cells with high metastatic potential,
suggesting a role for this miRNA as a metastasis-speciﬁc therapeutic target. Taken together, our results implied the existence
of pathways that regulate the viability and proliferation of
tumor cells only after they have acquired the ability to grow
at distant metastatic sites. As illustrated by miR-10b targeting,
such metastasis-dependent apoptotic pathways would offer
attractive targets for further therapeutic exploration. Cancer Res;

Introduction

"hub" of carcinogenesis, as a single miRNA can coordinately affect
the expression of multiple genes, resulting in a comprehensive
therapeutic response. In addition, because of the fundamental
role played by miRNAs in deﬁning tumor cell phenotypes, evasion of this therapeutic intervention by mutation is less likely.
This rationale is experimentally supported by the phenomenon
of oncomiR addiction, deﬁned as the incapacity of the tumor cell
to survive in the absence of certain oncomiRs. An example is
presented by miR-21. In a model of lymphoma, inactivation of
miR-21 led to a complete tumor regression in a matter of days (3).
These prior studies and our results described here support the
feasibility of curing human cancers through pharmacologic inactivation of miRNAs.
The paucity of options for patients with advanced and
recurring metastatic breast cancer prompted us to further investigate the potential for targeting miR-10b implicated in the
formation of metastasis (4, 5). To inhibit miR-10b, we used a
nanodrug (MN-anti–miR-10b) composed of magnetic nanoparticles conjugated to locked nucleic acid (LNA) antisense
oligonucleotides (6). Our choice of magnetic nanoparticles
(20 nm) extends from our earlier work, which demonstrated
that these nanoparticles represent very efﬁcient oligonucleotide delivery vehicles for RNAi-targeted therapy and imaging
(6–12). These nanoparticles have favorable biodistribution and
circulation half-life (6 hours in rodents and 24 hours in humans;
ref. 11). Following intravenous injection, the nanoparticles distribute through the circulation and progressively accumulate in
the tumor interstitium via the well-known enhanced permeability
and retention effect (13, 14). Once inside the tumoral interstitium, the nanoparticles are endocytosed by the tumor cells
through macropinocytosis and are ultimately released into the
cytosol, where they become available to the RISC, as described
previously (9).

Oncogenic microRNAs (oncomiR) have been shown to promote the migration, proliferation, and survival of tumor cells
(1, 2). Therefore, by targeting microRNA (miRNA) species, it
should be possible to achieve an effective and persistent therapeutic response in patients with cancer. Our hypothesis is based
on the rationale that the tumor cell phenotype is critically dependent on fundamental molecular pathways of oncogenesis and
that altering these pathways can result in very speciﬁc and robust
therapeutic effects. miRNAs, in particular, are a promising target
because they are uniquely altered in tumor cells and represent a

miR-10b. A, MN-anti–miR-10b

breast cancer cells with MN-anti–
miR-10b. Data, average  SD;

In the present study, we showed that the combination of MNanti–miR-10b with low-dose doxorubicin led to a complete and
persistent regression and elimination of metastatic cancer with no
evidence of systemic toxicity. We also found that the mechanism
behind this response involved a dramatic effect of the nanodrug
on tumor cell viability, akin to oncomiR addiction, potentiated by
a cell-cycle inhibitory effect of low-dose doxorubicin. These
studies present a new possibility for curing human metastatic
cancers through pharmacologic disruption of metastamiRs. The
clinical translation of this knowledge is particularly urgent in
patients diagnosed with advanced metastatic breast cancer or in
patients with disseminated recurrent disease.

Materials and Methods
LNA
The short LNA oligonucleotide sequences used in this study were
50 -ThioMC6-D/TCGGTTCTACAGGGT-30 (against miRNA-10b)
and 50 -ThioMC6-D/ACGTCTATACGCCCA-30 (scrambled oligo).
Both oligos were designed and synthesized by Exiqon Inc. The
50 -Thiol-Modiﬁer C6 disulﬁde (50 -ThioMC6) was inserted into
both sequences for conjugation to magnetic nanoparticles. The
disulﬁde on the oligonucleotide was activated by 3% Tris
(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP, Thermoscientiﬁc Co.), followed by puriﬁcation with ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation treatment prior to conjugation to the
nanoparticles, as described previously (6, 7).
MN-anti–miR-10b synthesis and characterization
Aminated magnetic nanoparticles were synthesized following a
protocol published previously (6). To afford near-infrared (NIRF)
imaging, nanoparticles were labeled with Cy5.5 NIRF optical dye
a described previously (7). Nanoparticles with 74 amino groups
per magnetic nanoparticle and a size of 20.3  0.6 nm were
used for conjugation to the LNA. Magnetic nanoparticle was
conjugated to the heterobifunctional linker N-succinimidyl 3[2-pyridyldithio]-propionate (SPDP; Thermoscientiﬁc Co.) and
activated LNA oligos sequentially. Brieﬂy, SPDP was dissolved in
anhydrous DMSO and incubated with magnetic nanoparticles,
which has a maleimide group for thioether linkage with the LNA
oligos. The 50 -ThioMC6 of the LNA oligo was activated to release
the thiol via 3% TCEP treatment in nuclease-free PBS. The LNA
oligos were puriﬁed using an ammonium acetate/ethanol precipitation method. After TCEP activation and puriﬁcation, the oligos
were dissolved in water and incubated with the SPDP-modiﬁed
magnetic nanoparticles overnight. MN-anti–miR-10b was freshly

4408 Cancer Res; 75(20) October 15, 2015

prepared each week and the number of LNA per magnetic nanoparticle was determined as 8.0  0.7 following the electrophoresis
analysis method described previously (6, 7). Schematic representation of MN-anti–miR-10b is shown in Fig. 1A.
Cell culture
The metastatic human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231luc-D3H2LN, was obtained from Perkin Elmer. The line was
authenticated by the supplier using the IMPACT Proﬁle I (PCR).
The cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma), supplemented with
10% FBS (Thermoscientiﬁc), 1% antibiotics (Invitrogen), and 2
mmol/L L-glutamine, per the supplier's instructions. The invasive
murine breast cancer cell line, 4T1, was obtained from ATCC. The
line was authenticated by the supplier on the basis of viability,
recovery, growth, morphology, and isoenzymology. The cells
were cultured in high-glucose DMEM supplemented with 5%
FBS and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin), as recommended by the supplier. The luciferasetransformed SUM149PT and SUM159PT human breast cancer
cell lines were provided by Dr. Kornelia Polyak (Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). The lines were authenticated using
short tandem repeat (STR) and SNP6 arrays, as well as wholeexome sequencing. The cells were cultured in a mixture of 50%
DMEM/F-12 50/50, 1 (Corning, CellGro) supplemented with
10% FBS and antibiotics (100 units/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin), and 50% mammary epithelial cell growth medium (Cell Applications, Inc.).
Generation of knockout cell line
A pair of TALEN (transcription activator–like proteins fused to
fok nickase)-expressing clones designed to generate a doublestranded cut in the genomic region of miR-10b were purchased
from GeneCopoeia. MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells were transfected following standard protocols and selected over hygromycin. Individual clones originating from a single cell were obtained
by serial dilution. PCR was performed on gDNA to determine
indel formation.
In vitro migration and invasion assays
Invasion assay was performed using 8-mm pore inserts coated
with extracellular matrix proteins (Cell Biolabs, Inc.). Uncoated
inserts served as migration controls. MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN
cells were serum-starved overnight in MEM medium. Following,
1.12  104 cells were plated inside the inserts. Drugs (MN-anti–
miR-10b or MN-scr-miR, 5 mmol/L or 21.7 mg ASO) with or
without 0.1 mmol/L doxorubicin were added directly to the cells.

Regression of Metastatic Cancer Using miRNA Nanotherapy

Outer chamber contained media supplemented with 10% FBS.
Inserts were incubated for 24 hours for migration assay and 48
hours for invasion assay, respectively. Cells that crossed the pore
were stained as described by the manufacturer and counted under
a light microscope.
In vitro apoptosis and cell proliferation
For apoptosis assay, 1  104 cells were plated in 8-chambered
slides (Lab-Tek, ThermoFisher) along with MN-anti–miR-10b or
MN-scr-miR (5 mmol/L ASO) in combination with 0.1 mmol/L of
doxorubicin. Slides were incubated for 60 hours and stained for
apoptosis using TUNEL assay kit (Chemicon International) and
mounted in anti-fade medium containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). Apoptotic and total cells were counted in 6 different
ﬁelds of view for each treatment and averaged. Cell proliferation
was determined by incubating cells for 48 hours with drug
combinations as above and assayed by MTT assay. In addition,
cell viability in luciferase-expressing SUM149PT and SUM159PT
cells was assessed by bioluminescence optical imaging, following
addition of D-luciferin potassium salt in DPBS (200 mL of 15
mg/mL; Perkin Elmer). Images were acquired using the IVIS
Spectrum Imaging System (Perkin Elmer). Identical imaging
acquisition settings (time, 0.5–60 seconds; F-stop, 2; binning,
medium) and the same area of regions of interest (ROI) were used
to obtain total radiance (photons/sec/cm2/sr1). Images were
processed using the Living Image Software (Ivis Spectrum, Perkin
Elmer). The total radiance from the bioluminescence readings was
used for signal quantiﬁcation.
Cell-cycle analysis
For cell-cycle analysis, 37,500 cells/mL were plated in a 6-well
culture plate. Cells were incubated with MN-anti–miR-10b or
MN-scr-miR (5 mmol/L ASO) alone or in combination with
doxorubicin (0.1 mmol/L) for 48 hours. Next, cells were washed
with PBS, collected by trypsinization, and ﬁxed in 70% ethanol
precooled to 20 C. The cells were washed again with PBS and
treated with RNase A (Worthington-Biochemical) for 30 minutes
at room temperature before adding propidium iodide. Cells were
analyzed on FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences).
SDS-PAGE and Western blotting
Cells treated with various drug combinations were washed with
cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer containing 1 mg/mL DNAse
(Roche Life Science) and supplemented with protease inhibitor
cocktail (Roche Life Science). Cell lysates, stored frozen at 80 C,
were resolved on 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred onto
a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were ﬁrst stained
with anti-BIM (Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-HOXD10
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody cocktail followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. ECL (Roche Life Science) was used to develop blots. Signal intensity was recorded
on an IVIS Spectrum imaging station (Perkin Elmer). After documenting signal, the blot was subjected to a second round of
immunostaining using an anti-actin HRP antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Fluorescence microscopy and nuclear size distribution
Cells grown in chambered slides were treated with drug combinations and stained for vimentin using Alexa Fluor 647–labeled
anti-vimentin antibody as instructed by the manufacturer (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology). Slides were mounted in 40 ,6-diamidino-2-

phenylindole (DAPI) containing antifade mounting medium
(Prolong Gold, Life Technologies) and observed under ﬂuorescence microscope. For nuclear size distribution studies, DAPIstained images were imported in ImageJ (ver. 1.48v) image
processing software. Calibration was applied, nuclei were
counted, and their area was determined. Four to 7 images were
analyzed to get data for at least 1,000 cells. Nuclei whose area fell
within 10 and 350 mm2 were selected and their distribution was
plotted.
Animal model
Six-week-old female nude mice (NIH III nude) were implanted
orthotopically under the top third mammary fat pad with the
MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cell line (2  106 cells). These animals formed primary tumors by 2 weeks that metastasized to
lymph nodes within 4 to 5 weeks. These cells expressed luciferase
and could be detected by noninvasive bioluminescence imaging
(BLI) for corresponding analysis of tumor burden. Akin to clinical
treatment of metastatic breast cancer, the primary tumor was
surgically removed once lymph node metastases were conﬁrmed
by BLI. Therapeutic treatment started from the day after primary
tumor removal and was repeated once a week as described below.
All animal experiments were performed in compliance with
institutional guidelines and approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee at Massachusetts General Hospital
(Boston, MA).
Three-dimensional ﬂuorescence imaging tomography
Cy5.5-labeled magnetic nanoparticle was administered by
intravenous injection into a mouse with bilateral secondary
tumors in axillary lymph nodes conﬁrmed by BLI. A set of
ﬂuorescence images was collected using an IVIS Spectrum imaging
station (Perkin Elmer) for the reconstruction of 3-dimensional
ﬂuorescence imaging tomography (3D-FLIT) using Living Image
software (ver. 4.4, Perkin Elmer). The excitation wavelength was
ﬁxed at 675 nm and the emission wavelength was 720 nm.
Overall, 18 ﬂuorescence images were processed to reconstruct
3D-FLIT for the illustration of ﬂuorescence sources in the body.
From these, 2D images were extracted in the coronal and transaxial planes.
Bioluminescence optical imaging
To evaluate metastatic burden, we used BLI. Anesthetized mice
were injected in the lower left abdominal quadrant with D-luciferin potassium salt in DPBS (200 mL of 15 mg/mL; Perkin Elmer)
12 minutes before image acquisition. Identical imaging acquisition settings (time, 0.5–60 seconds; F-stop, 2; binning, medium) and the same area of ROI were used to obtain total radiance
(photons/sec/cm2/sr) of the metastatic tumor signals. BLI (IVIS
Spectrum, Perkin Elmer) was performed for about 6 to 12 minutes
to obtain the maximum radiance from the metastatic tumors, and
all images were processed using the Living Image Software (IVIS
Spectrum, Perkin Elmer). The total radiance from the bioluminescence readings was used for signal quantiﬁcation.
Therapy
Therapy was delivered to animals after the surgical removal of
primary tumors, once lymph node metastases were conﬁrmed by
BLI. Treatment was initiated on the week of tumor removal. The
therapeutic protocol consisted of concurrent injections of MNanti–miR-10b or MN-scr-miR intravenously (15 mg/kg as iron, 10

mg/kg as LNA), and low-dose doxorubicin (intraperitoneally; 4
mg/kg; Sigma) for the following treatment groups were used:
Group 1: PBS only (n ¼ 2), Group 2: MN-scr-miR without
doxorubicin (n ¼ 6), Group 3: MN-scr-miR with doxorubicin
(n ¼ 10), Group 4: MN-anti–miR-10b only (n ¼ 7), and Group 5:
MN-scr-miR-10b with doxorubicin (n ¼ 10). Therapy was administered weekly until the disappearance of BLI-visible metastasis
(4 weeks to all mice in Group 5, 12 weeks to all the mice in Groups
1–4). All mice were monitored weekly by BLI to assess metastatic
burden for a maximum of 20 weeks after the ﬁrst treatment or
until animals became moribund. Mouse body weight was monitored before each imaging session.
Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
To measure the extent of miR-10b inhibition by MN-anti–
miR-10b, MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cells were incubated with
MN-anti–miR-10b or MN-scr-miR (45 mg iron, 4 nmol LNA) for
48 hours at 37  C. From the total extracted RNA, the miRNAenriched fraction was harvested using a miRNeasy mini kit,
according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen Inc.). Following the same protocol, metastatic lymph nodes harvested
after 2 weekly intravenous injections were homogenized to
extract the miRNA-enriched fraction. Relative levels of miR10b were determined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR; TaqMan protocol) and compared with the internal
housekeeping gene, SNORD44. TaqMan analysis was carried
out using an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system
(Applied Biosystems). The primers (Hs- miR-10b-3 miScript
Primer, Hs-SNORD44-11 miScript Primer) and assay kit (miScript PCR Starter Kit) were purchased from Qiagen.
Histology and ﬂuorescence microscopy of tissue sections
To analyze the metastatic lesions ex vivo and evaluate histopathology, excised tissues (lymph nodes, lungs, liver, spleen, intestine, brain, kidney) were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT compound
(Sakura Finetek) and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. The tissues
were cut into 7-mm sections. To determine MN-anti–miR-10b
accumulation in tissue, the sections were stained using incubation
with an anti-ﬁreﬂy luciferase antibody (1:50 dilution; Abcam) at
4 C overnight, followed by an FITC-conjugated anti-dextran
monoclonal antibody (1:50 dilution; Stemcell Technologies) and
a Texas Red–conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:50
dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at room temperature for 1
hour. Apoptosis in tumor tissues was evaluated by performing a
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end
labeling (TUNEL) assay (ApopTag Fluorescein In situ Apoptosis
Detection kit, Chemicon International) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For determining proliferation, frozen tumor
and lymph node sections were incubated with an anti-Ki67 antibody (1:100 dilution; Abcam) followed by a DyLight-488–labeled
secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 hour. Afterward, the
slides were counterstained and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium with DAPI (Vector Laboratories, Inc.). The sections
were analyzed by ﬂuorescence microscopy using a Nikon Eclipse
50i ﬂuorescence microscope (Nikon), equipped with the necessary
ﬁlter sets (Chroma Technology Corporation). Images were
acquired using a charge-coupled device camera with NIRF sensitivity (SPOT 7.4 Slider RTKE; Diagnostic Instruments). The images
were analyzed using SPOT 4.0 Advance version software (Diagnostic Instruments). For histopathology, the tissues were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).

Systemic toxicity
Blood was collected at necropsy via cardiac puncture, and
serum was separated by centrifugation at 1,600  g for 15
minutes. Serum chemistries from each mouse recipient were
analyzed by using Catalyst Dx Chemistry Analyzer, by IDEXX
Laboratories.
Statistical analysis
Data were expressed as mean  SD or SEM, where indicated.
Statistical comparisons were drawn using a two-tailed t test
(SigmaStat 3.0; Systat Software). A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
MN-anti–miR-10b can target miRNA-10b in breast tumor cells
and has a profound effect on metastatic tumor cell phenotype
To demonstrate that MN-anti–miR-10b synthesized as
designed (Fig. 1A) was functional in the human lymph node
metastatic MDA-MB-231-luc-D3H2LN cell line, we incubated
these cells with MN-anti–miR-10b. This resulted in signiﬁcant
86.3%  5.8% inhibition of the target miRNA-10b, compared
with the inactive control MN-scr-miR functionalized with an
irrelevant oligonucleotide (Fig. 1B). These results indicated that
the MN-anti–miR-10b design could be used to very efﬁciently
inhibit miRNA-10b in tumor cells.
To assess the therapeutic potential of this methodology, we
investigated the effect of miR-10b inhibition by MN-anti–miR10b on tumor cell apoptosis, proliferation, invasion, and migration. We found that miR-10b inhibition by MN-anti–miR-10b led
to a signiﬁcant induction of apoptosis, inhibition of proliferation,
and reduction in invasion and migration (Fig. 2). We also
hypothesized that by coadministering a low dose of a cytotoxic
chemotherapeutic (e.g., doxorubicin), we could amplify the
effectiveness of MN-anti–miR-10b. Namely, we posited that
low-dose doxorubicin would serve to inhibit the cell cycle and
slow down the rate of cell division, as shown by us previously (8).
Because the loss of these nanoparticles from tumor cells is
governed by cell division and not degradation or excretion
(15), the addition of low-dose doxorubicin is needed to achieve
higher therapeutic doses of MN-anti–miR-10b in tumor cells. We
observed that upon the combination treatment with MN-anti–
miR-10b (0.5 mmol/L) and a low-dose doxorubicin (0.05 mmol/L,
<IC10), the tumor cells acquired a spindle-like shape, detached,
and died (Fig. 2A). This corresponded to a signiﬁcant induction of
apoptosis (Fig. 2B) and decrease in proliferation (Fig. 2C).
Importantly, increased apoptosis was not seen in the absence of
MN-anti–miR-10b nor was it seen in cells treated with doxorubicin alone. The observed loss of cell viability had a broad
relevance to invasive disease because it was also seen in murine
4T1, as well as human SUM149PT and SUM159PT cells (Supplementary Fig. S1). Importantly, the induction of apoptosis by MNanti–miR-10b was highest in the more mesenchymal 4T1 and
SUM159PT cells and less pronounced in the more epithelial
SUM149PT cells (Supplementary Fig. S1b).
Analysis of the effect of the combination treatment on cell cycle
conﬁrmed our hypothesis regarding the mechanism underlying
the observed synergy between doxorubicin and MN-anti–miR10b. Namely, doxorubicin induced polyploidy and G2–M arrest
(Fig. 2D). This indicated that in the described scenario, doxorubicin, by inhibiting the cell cycle, acted as a sensitizer to a

proapoptotic trigger provided by MN-anti–miR-10b. In line with
this hypothesis, when low-dose doxorubicin and MN-anti–miR10b were combined, there was an increase of both the pre-G1
apoptotic and G2–M arrested cell populations. Interestingly, the
inhibition of the cell cycle appeared to extend solely from
the doxorubicin component of the combination treatment.
MN-anti–miR-10b did not demonstrate an appreciable effect on
the cell cycle, suggesting a cell-cycle independent apoptotic effect
(Fig. 2D).
A further look into the phenotypic effects of the combination
treatment revealed that, consistent with the literature (4) and our
prior studies (6), the combination treatment inhibited tumor
cell migration and invasion. The effect extended from MN-anti–
miR-10b alone and was not inﬂuenced by the presence of doxorubicin (Fig. 2E).
As noted above, treatment with MN-anti–miR-10b caused a
drastic change in morphology (Fig. 2A) that was further augmented by cotreatment with low-dose doxorubicin. This change was
reﬂected in profound reorganization of the cytoskeleton (Supplementary Fig. S2). The shape and size of the nucleus were also
affected. We have previously described that low-dose doxorubicin
results in cell-cycle arrest and nuclear swelling (8). Interestingly,
MN-anti–miR-10b treatment reduced the size of the nucleus and

www.aacrjournals.org

this effect was not reversed by the addition of low-dose doxorubicin (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results indicated that the
proapoptotic effects of the combination treatment manifested as
disruption in cytoskeletal and nuclear structure.
To further investigate the basis for the observed decrease in
tumor cell viability, we analyzed the expression of the proapoptotic member of the BCL-2 family member, BIM, which has
previously been implicated as a direct target of miR-10b in
glioblastoma (16). We focused on BIM, in addition to the
well-established miR-10b target HOXD10 implicated in tumor
cell invasion and metastasis (4). Consistent with our phenotypic
analysis, miR-10b inhibition in the presence or absence of doxorubicin led to upregulation of both HOXD10 and BIM (Fig. 2F).
The induction of BIM by MN-anti–miR-10b pointed to a molecular mechanism behind the observed link between miR-10b
and apoptosis in metastatic breast cancer cells, which is a novel
ﬁnding.
These studies indicate that by combining a low-dose cytotoxic
agent, such as doxorubicin and miR-10b inhibition using MNanti–miR-10b, it is possible to mediate a profound effect on
tumor cell phenotype manifested at its endpoint by tumor cell
death and loss of invasive properties. These results also suggested
that miR-10b is a metastamiR essential for tumor cell survival,

akin to the mechanism behind oncomiR addiction. Further proof
for this hypothesis came from experiments in which we attempted
to generate a miR-10b knockout subline derived from the MDAMB-231-luc-D3H2LN cell line (Supplementary Fig. S3a). We
observed that within 24 hours of transfection with the knockout
vector set (TALENs LþR), the cells acquired a spindle-shaped
conformation and began to detach. By 72 hours of transfection,
there were no viable cells (Supplementary Fig. S3b). This latter
result suggested that a robust therapeutic effect could also be
achieved by treatment with a higher dose of MN-anti–miR-10b
alone, in the absence of doxorubicin. However, at higher doses of
MN-anti–miR-10b, issues of oligotoxicity begin to emerge, making monotherapy less optimal.
Combination therapy with MN-anti–miR-10b and low-dose
chemotherapy can regress breast cancer metastasis
With an outlook toward clinical translation of our therapeutic approach, we performed therapeutic studies using a combination of MN-anti–miR-10b and low-dose doxorubicin in a
murine model of lymph node metastatic breast cancer. To
validate miR-10b as a metastasis-speciﬁc target in this model,
we ﬁrst compared the expression of miR-10b in the primary
tumors and lymph node metastases. miR-10b is upregulated in
metastatic breast cancer cell lines and in the primary tumors of
patients with breast cancer metastasis relative to nonmetastatic
patients (4). It is also upregulated in metastatic samples relative
to matched primary tumors (17). Consistent with these ﬁndings, we also observed highly signiﬁcant overexpression of miR10b in the lymph node metastases relative to the primary
tumors of the animal model used here (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Following a clinical scenario, we surgically removed the
primary tumors after conﬁrmation of lymph node metastasis.
Because inhibition of miR-10b does not affect primary tumor
growth (6), removal of the tumor was necessary to permit longterm studies without mortality. Accumulation of MN-anti–
miR-10b in the lymph nodes 24 hours after intravenous injection was conﬁrmed by in vivo NIRF optical imaging (Fig. 3A)
and veriﬁed by ﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B). Effective

miR-10b inhibition in metastatic tumor cells was conﬁrmed
by RT-PCR (Fig. 3C).
In therapeutic time course studies, there was complete regression of lymph node metastasis in the experimental mice treated
with MN-anti–miR-10b and low-dose doxorubicin after 4
weeks of therapy (Fig. 4A, ii). In contrast, in the control groups,
there was metastatic progression. In the experimental mice,
treatment was discontinued once complete metastatic regression was observed at week 4. Still, by the endpoint of the study
at week 12, no recurrence was observed (Fig. 4A and B). Ex vivo
analysis revealed the presence of lymph node metastasis
and metastatic dissemination to the lungs in control animals
treated with PBS or MN-scr-miR with or without doxorubicin
(Fig. 4C). In the mice treated with MN-anti–miR-10b only,
there was evidence of metastasis to the lymph node but not to
the lungs. In contrast, in mice treated with MN-anti–miR-10b
and doxorubicin, no gross lymph node or lung metastases
could be detected (Fig. 4C).
Histopathologic analysis indicated that in the control groups
treated with PBS or MN-scr-miR in the presence or absence of
doxorubicin, there was lymph node and lung inﬁltration by
tumor cells. In mice treated with MN-anti–miR-10b alone, there
were metastases in the lymph nodes with no evidence of lung
involvement. In contrast, in mice treated with MN-anti–miR-10b
and doxorubicin, the lymph nodes and lungs appeared clear of
metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S5).
The effect of therapy with MN-anti–miR-10b and low-dose
doxorubicin also translated into signiﬁcant improvement in body
weight (Fig. 4D) and survival (Fig. 4E). Unlike control groups, by
week 14 after the beginning of therapy, none of the experimental
animals (MN-anti–miR-10b/doxorubicin) had succumbed to
cancer. Furthermore, combination therapy with doxorubicin and
MN-anti–miR-10b was superior to monotherapy with MN-anti–
miR-10b (Fig. 4A–E). We need to note that the MN-scr-miR
control nanodrug also had an effect on the overall survival. This
could be assigned to the presence of a CpG motif in the scr oligo
(but not on the anti–miR-10b oligo) that is known to stimulate
signaling through Toll-like receptors (18).

Regression of Metastatic Cancer Using miRNA Nanotherapy

or without doxorubicin continued to gain weight throughout the time course of the study. E, mortality. Only in the group of animals treated with MN-anti–miR-10b
and doxorubicin, there was no mortality from carcinoma. Data, average  SEM; within-subjects ANOVA: P < 0.05. PBS, n ¼ 2; MN-scr-miR, n ¼ 6; MN-scr-miR þ Dox,
n ¼ 10; MN-anti–miR-10b, n ¼ 7; MN-anti–miR-10b þ Dox, n ¼ 10.

By the 15th week of therapy, the differences between experimental and control animals were apparent by simple anatomic
observation. The control animals treated with MN-scr-miR and
doxorubicin displayed gross lymphadenopathy (Supplementary
Fig. S6a and Supplementary Video S8) and cachexia (Supplementary Fig. S6b and Supplementary Video S8). The experimental
animals treated with MN-anti–miR-10b and doxorubicin
appeared healthy (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary
Video S8). Long-term observation indicated that the remission
of metastatic disease was permanent and that the treatment
resulted in an effective cure (Supplementary Fig. S7).
Ex vivo examination of the lymph nodes revealed both induction of apoptosis and reduction of proliferation in the MN-anti–
miR-10b groups compared with the MN-scr-miR groups either
with or without chemotherapy (Fig. 5). This ﬁnding is expected on
the basis of our in vitro results.
Having demonstrated that the combination treatment is efﬁcacious, we needed to address the important issue of systemic
toxicity. We analyzed a panel of blood chemistry markers, including indicators of renal, liver toxicity, etc., and found no signiﬁcant
deviations that could be assigned to components of MN-anti–
miR-10b (Fig. 6A). In addition, histopathology of major organs
demonstrated the absence of any gross tissue abnormalities (Fig.
6B), suggesting that there was no chronic toxicity as a result of
treatment.
Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence of
the potential of miR-10b as a target for the therapy of metastatic
breast cancer. Importantly, efﬁcient therapeutic delivery vehicles,
such as the one described here, hold one of the keys to the
effectiveness of therapeutic intervention.

Discussion
Here, we describe a new therapeutic strategy for the treatment of
metastatic breast cancer that combines a molecularly targeted
therapeutic agent that inhibits the prometastatic miR-10b with a
low dose of doxorubicin. The choice of miR-10b as a target is
based on the fact that it is involved in tumor cell invasion and
migration in metastatic cancer (4, 17, 19). Ma and colleagues
(4, 5) were the ﬁrst to establish that miR-10b initiates breast cancer
invasion and metastasis. The clinical importance of miR-10b is
underscored by the ﬁnding that although it is expressed at low
levels in samples from metastasis-free patients with breast cancer,
it is overexpressed in the patients with metastatic disease (4).
The choice of miR-10b is further motivated by its potentially
broad relevance to cancer. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the inﬂuence of this miRNA extends beyond breast cancer
(5, 6, 20-22) and also includes lung, colorectal, gastric, bladder,
pancreatic, ovarian, hepatocellular, and brain cancer, suggesting
that the proposed therapeutic approach may have a more global
relevance to metastatic disease (16, 17).
The key advancement presented by the current investigation
extends from the discovery of a previously unknown effect of
miR-10b on the viability of metastatic cancer cells. Speciﬁcally,
miR-10b inhibition in these cells resulted in a complete loss of
viability through apoptosis. Given the speciﬁc overexpression
of miR-10b in metastatic cells and their inability to survive once
miR-10b is efﬁciently inhibited, we have termed this phenomenon "metastamiR addiction," akin to "oncomiR addiction."
miR-10b metastamiR addiction is at the root of the robust
therapeutic response engendered by the combination of

dox relative to the control groups. In these studies, tissues representing the MN-anti–miR-10b þ dox group were derived from an animal sacriﬁced after
2 weeks of treatment when lymph node metastases had not completely regressed. Still, metastatic burden in that animal was lower than in the control groups. TUNEL,

MN-anti–miR-10b and a low-dose cytostatic, such as doxorubicin. The mechanism behind this response relies most profoundly on the effect of the miR-10b inhibitor on metastatic
cell viability. In our studies, whereas low-dose doxorubicin
strictly effected cell-cycle arrest, the miR-10b–inhibitory MNanti–miR-10b limited migration and invasion through its target
HOXD10 (4), and induced apoptosis partially by upregulating
the proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein, BIM. While known for its
relevance to brain cancer (16), BIM has not been described as
a miR-10b target in metastatic breast cancer cells and represents
a novel ﬁnding.

Given the more pronounced proapoptotic effect of the
nanodrug in cells with a more mesenchymal phenotype and
in line with our earlier studies, which suggested that miR-10b
plays a context-dependent role in tumorigenesis (6), the
observed effects are likely relevant to highly invasive, metastatic
tumor cells. These ﬁndings suggest the possibility that miR-10b
could inﬂuence the proliferation and/or viability of a distinct
subpopulation of highly invasive cells, as the ones used in this
study. Indeed, miR-10b is upregulated in metastatic breast
cancer cell lines and in the primary tumors of patients with
breast cancer metastasis relative to nonmetastatic patients (4).

Regression of Metastatic Cancer Using miRNA Nanotherapy

It is also upregulated in metastatic samples relative to matched
primary tumors (17).
On a broader scale, these results support the existence of
pathways that regulate the viability of tumor cells only after these
cells have acquired the ability to migrate. The identiﬁcation and
targeting of these metastasis-dependent apoptotic pathways
would represent an attractive area of therapeutic development
for cancer.
The signiﬁcance of our work derives from the fact that by
presenting the possibility of regression and elimination of
metastases, the described approach can have a transformative
impact on cancer. If successful, this therapeutic strategy is
poised for immediate clinical translation, considering that
MN-anti–miR-10b is based on clinically approved components. Speciﬁcally, with an outlook toward clinical translation,
which requires FDA approval, we used a simpliﬁed MN-anti–
miR-10b design, in line with our previous studies that elucidated essential MN-anti–miR-10b components (7). This high
translational potential underscores the impact of the work, as a
stepping-stone toward the introduction of a novel therapeutic
modality for metastatic breast cancer.
