ATF3, a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA binding protein, is a
member of the ATF/cAMP-responsive element binding protein
(CREB) transcription factor family and can form both homodimers
as well as heterodimers with bZIP proteins to repress transcription
(8). Although basal expression is minimal, ATF3 can be induced, for
example by transforming growth factor (TGF)h1(9). Recent work
has shown that TGFh-mediated ATF3 expression significantly
repressed expression of Nrf2-mediated ARE-directed phase II genes
such as glutamate-cytosine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), GSTs,
catalase, SOD1, and selenoprotein P (10). However, molecular details
are elusive. Here, we report on mechanistic studies involving ATF3
repression of Nrf2/ARE-directed gene expression. Immunoprecipitation experiments coupled with GST-Nrf2 binding assays indicated
that ATF3 directly bound Nrf2. DNA affinity precipitation and
chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP) experiments showed
that the ATF3-Nrf2 interaction occurred at the level of the ARE
under conditions in which ARE-directed reporter activity was
attenuated. Small hairpin RNA (shRNA) knockdown of ATF3 showed
that the CREB-binding protein, CBP, known to associate with two
transcriptional activation domains within Nrf2, was displaced in an
ATF3-dependent fashion. Thus, these experiments identify ATF3 as
a novel repressor of Nrf2-mediated gene expression.

Abstract
The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived
2–related factor 2 (Nrf2) regulates induction of an extensive
cellular stress response network when complexed with the
cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CBP) at antioxidant
response elements (ARE) located in the promoter region of
target genes. Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) can
repress Nrf2-mediated signaling in a manner that is not well
understood. Here, we show that ATF3-mediated suppression is
a consequence of direct ATF3-Nrf2 protein-protein interactions
that result in displacement of CBP from the ARE. This work
establishes ATF3 as a novel repressor of the Nrf2-directed
stress response pathway. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):364–8]

Introduction
The nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2–related factor 2 (Nrf2)regulated signaling pathway functions to detoxify electrophilic
and reactive oxygen carcinogens (1) and involves transcriptional
induction of >200 genes via heterodimeric binding at antioxidant
response elements (ARE) located in the proximal promoter of
target genes. Nrf2 heterodimerization is a sequence-specific consequence of leucine zipper–coiled coil domain interactions with
transcription factors such as small Mafs, activating transcription
factor (ATF)4, and the Jun family (1). Under homeostatic conditions, Nrf2 levels are maintained at low levels due to E3 ubiquitin ligase–mediated ubiquitylation and proteasome-dependent
degradation of Nrf2 (2). Oxidative and electrophilic carcinogens
can inhibit Nrf2 degradation, allowing newly synthesized Nrf2
to translocate into the nucleus and induce ARE-directed gene
expression; examples include glutathione S-transferases (GST),
NAD(P)H: quinone reductase, glutamate cysteine ligase, heme
oxygenase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (1). Nrf2mediated gene expression can impact inflammatory responses (3),
oxidative-mediated DNA adduct formation (4), and susceptibility to
chemical carcinogens (5) due to phase II gene expression. Although
significant attention has been directed toward understanding
mechanisms of induction, suppression of Nrf2 transactivation is
less understood but phenotypically as important. Currently, it is
known that overexpression of Fra or Fos can repress Nrf2-mediated
gene expression with titration being the hypothesized mechanism.
Additionally, Nrf2 heterodimers can be displaced from ARE
sequences by formation of Nrf3/maf heterodimers (6, 7).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, plasmids, and antibodies. NMuMG cells (mouse
mammary epithelial cells; a gift from Dr. C Arteaga, Vanderbilt University,
Nashville, TN) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and
insulin (10 mg/mL). In some experiments, the serum concentration was
decreased to 5% and cells were exposed to TGFh1 to increase the expression
of endogenous ATF3. The ATF3 expression vector (pCG/ATF3) was a
gracious gift from Dr. T. Hai (Ohio State University, Columbus, OH). pcDNA/
V5mNrf2 was a gracious gift from Dr. M. McMahon (University of Dundee,
Dundee, Scotland, United Kingdom). The following antibodies were used:
Actin (Sigma), ATF3, and Nrf2 (Santa Cruz).
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Protein extracts from
NMuMG cells were analyzed as described in ref. 10. Detection was
performed using Enhanced Chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences). For immunoprecipitation, cells were washed twice in ice-cold PBS and
solubilized in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 150 mmol/L
NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.2), 1% Triton X-100, 1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1%
SDS, and 5 mmol/L EDTA plus 1 mmol/L 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride]. Solubilized protein was cleared with protein
A/G and then immunoprecipitated with antibody. The washed pellet was
solubilized in 5 SDS sample buffer.
GST/Nrf2 ATF3 interaction. Mouse Nrf2 was PCR amplified and
inserted into pGEX-4T1 vector between SalI and Not I sites. The following
primers were used to amplify mNrf2: 5¶-CCC GGG TCG ACT CAT GAT GGA
CTT GGA GTT GCC ACC G-3¶ and 5¶-CAG CAG CGG CCG CCT AGT TTT
TCT TTG TAT CTG GCT TC-3¶. The resulting pGEX-4T1 vectors were
verified by sequencing and then used to transform BL21 (PLyss) strain.

ATF3 Suppresses Nrf2-Directed Gene Expression
ChIP assay. NMuMG cells were treated with either with vehicle control
or 2 ng/mL TGFh1 for 18 h. Cells were crosslinked with formaldehyde ( final
concentration 1%) for 10 min at room temperature and processed for ChIP
analysis (ChIP-IT) according to the manufacture’s instructions (Active
Motif). PCR amplification of mGST Ya ARE (11) was accomplished using the
following primers: 5¶-GAA TCA GCT TGT GGG TGT GT-3¶ (sense primer)
and 5¶-CAG TTA CTC CTG TGG GAA AG-3¶ (antisense primer). The PCR
products were separated on 3% agarose gels and stained with ethidium
bromide. PCR products were confirmed by DNA sequencing.
ATF3 shRNA. NMuMG cells, growing exponentially in T-75 flasks, were
infected with a shRNA retroviral vector (Open Biosystems) directed against
ATF3, and clones were selected for puromycin resistance. Control cells were
infected with a shRNA retroviral vector expressing a nonsilencing construct
and clones were selected for puromycin resistance.
Transcriptional assays. Cells were cotransfected with the following
plasmids: pGL3pro/ARE4 luciferase and pcDNA3.1/LacZ using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Firefly
luciferase and h-galactosidase activities in cell lysates were determined
using a Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Luciferase activity was normalized to h-galactosidase activity to
account for transfection efficiency.
Measurement of reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species
(ROS) production was measured in NMuMG cells after exposure to
100 Amol/L diethyl maleate (DEM) for 3 h at 37jC using the oxidative
sensitive dye C-400 (Molecular Probes).

Fusion proteins were purified from bacteria using glutathione-agarose resin.
The eluted proteins were dialyzed in buffer [20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0),
100 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 mmol/L mercaptoethanol] and
stored in solution at 4jC. Empty vector was used to express GST to use as a
control in the binding assays.
PCR-amplified ATF3 was inserted into a pcDNA3.1 vector and used in a
rabbit in vitro transcription and translation kit (Promega) to express [35S]labeled ATF3. GST-Nrf2 and GST (15–25 Ag) were immobilized onto
glutathione-agarose beads (30 AL of 50% slurry) in 300 AL NETN buffer
[20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5%
NP40]. Unbound proteins were removed by washing the agarose beads with
NETN buffer. The washed pellets were resuspended in 400 AL binding buffer
[20 mmol/L HEPES-KOH (pH 7.9), 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 100 mmol/L KCl,
20%(v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mmol/L EDTA, and 0.5 mmol/L DTT] and incubated
at 4jC for 1 h with 40 AL of [35S]-labeled ATF3. The pellets were washed
thrice with NETN buffer, boiled in 10 AL of 5 SDS buffer, and separated on
12% polyacrylamide gel. After drying, the gel was exposed to film.
DNA precipitation. NMuMG cells were treated with either vehicle
control or 2 ng/mL TGFh1 for 18 h. Cells were harvested and nuclei were
isolated. Nuclear extracts were prepared by extracting with EB [10 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.9), 420 mmol/L NaCl, 0.1 mmol/L EGTA, 25% glycerol,
1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and 0.5 mmol/L DTT] containing protease inhibitor
cocktail. An ARE4 element from the GCLC promoter region was synthesized
with biotin on the sense strand at the 5¶ end. Streptavidin agarose (30 AL)
was incubated with 3 Ag of Biotin ARE4 in 600 AL of NE3 buffer [20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.9), 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 100 mmol/L KCl, 20% glycerol,
0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, and protease inhibitor cocktail] for
30 min with mixing at 4C. Approximately 500 to 700 Ag of nuclear extract
and 100 Ag of Poly dI-dC were added and the volume was adjusted to
1.5 mL. The mixture was incubated at 4jC for 20 min with gentle mixing.
The samples were centrifuged and the pellet was washed thrice with WB
(20 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mmol/L KCl, 2.5 mmol/L MgCl2, and
protease inhibitor cocktail). The pellet was heated with 20 AL of 5 SDS
buffer. Samples were subjected to immunoblot analysis.

Results and Discussion
Nrf2 functions as a node for regulating the expression of >200
genes that encode a cellular stress response network. Although
ATF3 can suppress the induction of this network (10), a molecular understanding of the mechanism is lacking. The data presented in Fig. 1A show that ATF3 can suppress the ability of Nrf2 to

pcDNA/V5mNrf2, pCG/ATF3, and pcDNA3.1 (concentrations denoted in Figure). Luciferase (Lux ) activity derived from pGL3pro/ARE4 luciferase is expressed
relative to h-galactosidase activity. ARE4-directed luciferase activity increased 2.8-fold in cells transiently transfected with an Nrf2 expression vector compared
with cells transfected with control vector (pcDNA3.1; P < 0.05; Student’s t test). Cotransfection of an ATF3 expression vector repressed the ability of Nrf2 to
induce ARE4-directed reporter activity (P < 0.05; ANOVA); B, immunoblot demonstrating that HO-1 expression was increased in NMuMG cells stably infected
with retrovirus expressing shRNA directed against ATF3 (clones A–C). Control cells were infected with virus expressing nonsilencing shRNA (clones 1–3).
The expression of ATF3 relative to actin and HO-1 relative to actin was determined using a quantitative digitizing software program. C, ATF3 represses
detoxification of a xenobiotic. NMuMG cells were transiently transfected with either pcDNA3.1 (control vector) or pCG/ATF3. Forty-eight hours after transfection,
cells were exposed to either vehicle control or 100 Amol/L DEM for 3 h at 37jC. ROS-mediated C-400 fluorescence was then measured (10).

ATF3 Suppresses Nrf2-Directed Gene Expression

Figure 4. A, stable retroviral expression
of an ATF3 shRNA knocks down ATF3.
NMuMG cells were exposed to 0 or
2 ng/mL TGFh1 for 24 h, and lysates
were immunoblotted for ATF3 and
actin. B, ChIP assay demonstrating
that CBP binding at an ARE in cells
expressing an ATF3 shRNA is
independent of TGFh. Ab, antibody.

ATF3 expression can be increased in a TGFh-mediated
manner (9). The amount of ATF3 present at the ARE increased
(Fig. 3A) when nuclear ATF3 levels were elevated in TGFhtreated cells (10) and (Fig. 3C) coincident with a decrease in the
presence of c-Jun and CBP. Nrf2 binding was unaffected
(Fig. 3A). Use of a ChIP assay and a representative ARE
sequence (GST Ya ARE; ref. 11) corroborated the observation that
CBP levels were diminished coincident with increased detection
of ATF3 at the ARE (Fig. 3B).
Use of ChIP assays showed that TGFh1 increased the amount of
ATF3 present at a representative ARE in vivo (Fig. 3C). Under basal
conditions, ATF3 was associated with only 35% of the GST Ya ARE.
Exposing cells to 2 ng/mL of TGFh1 for 4 h elevated nuclear ATF3
levels (10) and increased the amount of ATF3 residing at the GST
Ya ARE by f2-fold, coincident with ATF3-mediated suppression of
Nrf2 target genes (10).
Next, we used the NMuMG cells that stably expressed ATF3
shRNA from a retroviral vector or expressed a nonsilencing
construct, as described in Fig. 1. In control cells, TGFh produced
a robust increase in ATF3 expression (Fig. 4A). Please note that
under these detection conditions, basal ATF3 was not observed. In
cells expressing ATF3 shRNA, TGFh did not produce a robust
increase in ATF3 (Fig. 4A). Knock down of ATF3 by shRNA
retroviral expression abrogated TGFh-mediated loss of CBP at the
ARE, as shown in the ChIP assay shown in Fig. 4B. Specifically, cells
expressing nonsilencing shRNA, exhibited a 50% loss of CBP
associated with the GST Ya ARE. In contrast, there was only a 10%
decrease in cells expressing ATF3 shRNA.
In conclusion we propose that formation of ATF3-Nrf2
heterodimers at AREs located in the proximal promoter of Nrf2
target genes suppresses recruitment of CBP, which in turn
represses the ability of Nrf2 to induce target gene expression.
These data identify ATF3 as a novel repressor of Nrf2-mediated
signaling.

clone C relative to control). Expression of HO-1, a Nrf2 target gene
(12), was increased 2.3- to 2.6-fold relative to control after shRNAmediated ATF3 knockdown, consistent with expectations (Fig. 1B).
Both the expression of GST and cellular glutathione (GSH)
concentrations are Nrf2 regulated (13, 14). GST isoenzymes
catalyze nucleophilic attack by GSH on nonpolar compounds such
as DEM that contain an electrophilic carbon, nitrogen, or sulfur
atom. We assessed GST/GSH-mediated DEM detoxification by
quantifying production of ROS (15) and found that ATF3
expression suppressed detoxification, as measured by a 30%
increase in ROS production (Fig. 1C). These results are consistent
with ATF3-mediated suppression of Nrf2-directed gene expression.
We found that endogenous Nrf2 and ATF3 reside as an
immunoprecipitable complex (Fig. 2A). A GST/Nrf2 fusion protein
was constructed and used to determine whether Nrf2 physically
interacted with in vitro transcribed/translated ATF3. A purified
GST/Nrf2 fusion protein immobilized on GSH-agarose beads was
found to capture [35S]-labeled ATF3, in contrast to purified GST
immobilized on GSH-agarose beads (Fig. 2B). These results show
that Nrf2 and ATF3 physically interact in vitro. Furthermore, we
found that in vitro transcribed/translated [35S]-labeled ATF3 and
[35S]-labeled Nrf2 formed a heterodimer (Fig. 2C), which bound to
and retarded a representative ARE sequence (GST Ya ARE; ref. 16)
in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. 2D). This interaction was
disrupted by the presence of an ATF3 antibody (aATF3).
Under basal conditions, ATF3 exhibits both a nuclear and
cytosolic distribution, but expression is limited (10). Biochemical
fractionation followed by DNA precipitation using a biotinylated
double-stranded representative antioxidant response element
oligonucleotide (ARE4; ref. 17) and detection by immunoblotting
allowed us to show that ATF3 was associated with bound Nrf2 and
resided at the ARE (Fig. 3A). Two Nrf2 species of slightly different
molecular weight were found bound to the ARE oligomer. The
nature of these two species is not known at this time but may be
related to phosphorylation of Nrf2 (18). The observation that c-Jun
resided with Nrf2 at an ARE (Fig. 3A) is consistent with the work of
Jeyapaul et al. (19) who showed that c-Jun-Nrf2 heterodimers
positively regulate ARE-directed gene expression. Once bound to an
ARE, Nrf2 cooperatively associates with CBP to activate transcription of target genes (20). As expected, the DNA precipitation
experiments showed the presence of CBP at the ARE (Fig. 3A).
