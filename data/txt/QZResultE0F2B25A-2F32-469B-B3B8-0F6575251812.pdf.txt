BACKGROUND: To determine the potential efficacy of targeting both the tumor and bone microenvironment in patients
with castration-resistant prostate cancer (PC), the authors conducted a phase 1-2 trial combining docetaxel with dasatinib,
an oral SRC inhibitor. METHODS: In phase 1, 16 men received dasatinib 50 to 120 mg once daily and docetaxel 60 to 75
mg/m2 every 21 days. In phase 2, 30 additional men received dasatinib 100 mg once daily/docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every
21 days. Efficacy endpoints included changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA), measurable disease, bone scans, and
markers of bone metabolism. Safety and pharmacokinetics were also studied. RESULTS: Combination dasatinib and
docetaxel therapy was generally well tolerated. Thirteen of 46 patients (28%) had a grade 3-4 toxicity. Drug-drug interactions and a maximum tolerated dose were not identified. Durable 50% PSA declines occurred in 26 of 46 patients
(57%). Of 30 patients with measurable disease, 18 (60%) had a partial response. Fourteen patients (30%) had disappearance of a lesion on bone scan. In bone marker assessments, 33 of 38 (87%) and 26 of 34 (76%) had decreases in
urinary N-telopeptide or bone-specific alkaline phosphatase levels, respectively. Twenty-eight patients (61%) received
single-agent dasatinib after docetaxel discontinuation and had stabilization of disease for an additional 1 to 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: The high objective response rate and favorable toxicity profile are promising and justify randomized
studies of docetaxel and dasatinib in castration-resistant PC. Parallel declines in levels of PSA and bone markers are
consistent with cotargeting of epithelial and bone compartments of the cancer. Treatment with single-agent dasatinib

Mortality in patients with advanced prostate cancer (PC) is associated with osseous spread of bone-forming

metastases.1-4 Clinical observations and mechanistic-based studies implicate signaling by paracrine factors from the tumor
microenvironment in PC progression.5-8 These findings suggest that successful therapeutic strategies will require targeting
of signaling pathways central to both the tumor and bone microenvironment.
SRC-family kinases are nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases that are rational therapeutic targets for castration-resistant PC. The SRC-family kinases SRC, LYN, and FYN have established roles in PC growth, invasion, and metastasis.9-14
Elevated SRC-family kinase activity in tumors from patients with PC is associated with a shorter responses to androgenablation therapy, metastasis to the bone, and shorter survival.15 SRC also has key roles in regulating osteoclast function
and in the pathogenesis of bone metastases.16-20
Dasatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits SRC-family kinases and also has activity against ABL1,
platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), KIT,10,21 EPHA2,22 and focal adhesion kinase.23 In vitro, dasatinib
decreased proliferation and migration of PC cells,11,15 including the hormone-refractory cell line LNCaP-SDM.15 In a
mouse model, dasatinib treatment significantly reduced prostate tumor size and number of lymph node metastases

compared with control mice.11 In mice with prostate tumor cells injected intratibially, dasatinib significantly lowered serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) concentrations
and increased bone mineral density, and treatment with
dasatinib plus docetaxel had greater activity than either
agent alone.12 These preclinical studies led to our hypothesis that combining dasatinib with docetaxel would
improve treatment of patients with metastatic castrationresistant PC by targeting both the tumor and bone
microenvironment.
To test this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 study was conducted to define the toxicity profile, pharmacokinetics
(PK), and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of oral dasatinib combined with docetaxel in patients with metastatic
castration-resistant PC. Secondary objectives were to
assess tumor responses, PSA responses, progression-free
survival (PFS), bone scan changes, and modulation of
bone turnover markers.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Eligibility Criteria
The study was conducted in accordance with institutional
and federal regulations including informed consent. Men
aged 18 years were eligible if they had metastatic PC
that had progressed despite castrate levels of serum testosterone (50 ng/dL). Progression was defined as increased
size or appearance of 1 new radiographic lesions, 2 or
more new lesions on bone scan or 1 new lesion on bone
scan with rising PSA, or 2 consecutive PSA rises (5 ng/
mL) separated by 2 weeks. Exclusion criteria were brain
metastases, clinically significant cardiovascular disease,
existing pleural/pericardial effusion, second malignancy
(excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), and prior treatment with >1 chemotherapy (including docetaxel) or
course of palliative radiotherapy or any radioisotope.
There was no limit on prior hormonal therapy.
Bisphosphonate therapy could be continued but could
not be initiated immediately before or on study. The registered study number was CA180-086 (clinicaltrials.gov
NCT00439270).
Study Design
This was an open-label phase 1-2 study. In phase 1,
cohorts of patients were treated with escalating doses of
docetaxel and dasatinib. Docetaxel was administered
intravenously every 21 days from Day 1 of Cycle 1 with
twice daily oral prednisone 5 mg. Oral dasatinib was initiated on Day 3 of Cycle 1 and administered once daily

64

continuously. Coadministered doses of dasatinib (mg
once daily)/docetaxel (mg/m2 every 21 days) were: 50/60,
50/75, 70/75, 100/75, and 120/75. To enable accurate
evaluation of safety and PK, patients without disease progression or significant toxicity received a minimum of 6
cycles of therapy. Therapy was discontinued for disease
progression (defined below) after a minimum of 2 cycles
of combination therapy, or earlier for serious adverse
events (AEs), rapid progression, or withdrawal of consent.
Patients with stable or responding disease after 6 cycles
were permitted to receive further dasatinib with or without docetaxel at the investigator’s discretion.
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations
Blood samples for PK analysis were collected on Day 1
(Cycle 1) for docetaxel alone, Day 14 (Cycle 1) for dasatinib alone, and Day 21 (Cycle 2, Day 1) for the combination. PK parameters were derived from plasma
concentration versus time and included maximum plasma
concentration (Cmax), area under curve (AUC) for a dosing interval or from time zero to infinity, time to Cmax,
plasma half-life, and clearance. PK interactions were
assessed using point estimates and 90% confidence interval (CI) of Cmax and AUC with dasatinib and docetaxel
alone or in combination.
Safety Evaluations
AEs were assessed continuously and graded according to
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria (version 3.0). Dose-limiting toxicity was defined
between Day 3 (Cycle 1) and Day 42 (Cycle 2, Day 21) as
grade 4 neutropenia causing treatment interruption for
>14 days, febrile neutropenia, grade 4 thrombocytopenia, grade 3 thrombocytopenia with a bleeding episode
requiring platelet transfusion, nausea and/or vomiting despite medical intervention/prophylaxis causing treatment
interruption for >14 days, grade 3-4 asthenia/fatigue, any
other grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity except alopecia
or transient arthralgia/myalgia (unless unresponsive to
intervention), or interruption of study drug for >14 days
due to toxicity.
Efficacy Evaluations
Serum PSA concentrations were determined every 3
weeks. PSA response was defined as 50% decrease in
PSA concentration from baseline sustained for 6 weeks.
PSA progression was defined as 3 consecutive PSA
increases from baseline/nadir observed at 1-week intervals, including PSA increase to 5 ng/mL and by 50%,

as per Prostate Cancer Working Group 1 recommendations.24 Duration of PSA response was measured from the
first of 2 consecutive measurements confirming response
until the first of 3 consecutive measurements confirming
PSA progression, disease progression (defined below), or
death. Time to PSA progression was not a specified endpoint and was not determined.
For patients with measurable disease, Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were used
to define patients with a complete response or partial
response (PR) or who had not met criteria for response or
tumor progression after 18 weeks of treatment. Tumor
progression was defined as either 20% increase in sum
of longest diameters of target lesions from nadir, progression of nonmeasurable lesions, or detection of new lesions.
As per Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 recommendations, response determination excluded pelvic lymph
nodes measuring <2 cm.25 Tumor assessments were performed every 6 weeks.
Pretreatment bone scans were performed within 28
days before treatment and every 6 weeks after starting
docetaxel. Bone scans were classified as improved (disappearance of at least 1 lesion and no new lesion or pain),
stable (no new lesions/pain), or progressed (at least 2 areas
of new focal uptake or new adverse clinical symptoms).
Confirmatory bone scans were not required. A subset of
patients treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson
Cancer Center, Houston, Texas, were categorized as having high (20 or more lesions), intermediate (10-20
lesions), or low (1-9 lesions) bone-lesion volume at
baseline.
Concentrations of serum bone alkaline phosphatase
(BAP; marker of osteoblast activity/differentiation) and
urinary N-telopeptide (NTx; marker of osteoclast activity) were measured before treatment and on study.
Progression was defined as either bone scan progression or at least 2 of the following: tumor progression
(RECIST), PSA progression, or investigator-defined clinical progression. The protocol-specified definition of progression therefore differs from recommendations
published after the study was initiated.25 As appropriate
for an early-phase trial, the protocol did not require that
patients should be followed for progression after discontinuing study treatment, due to PFS not being the primary endpoint of the study and the likelihood that
patients would receive additional therapies after discontinuing that may have impacted PFS. Because of a relatively high proportion of patients in whom the date of
progression could not be obtained and difficulties of data

interpretation, PFS could not be accurately ascertained
and is not reported.
For patients who remained on single-agent dasatinib
for >21 days after discontinuing docetaxel treatment, duration of additional single-agent therapy was measured
from the date of last docetaxel dose to the date of progression or death, discontinuation, or last efficacy assessment.

RESULTS
Patients and Treatment
Forty-six patients were treated (Table 1). Median age was
65 years. Thirty-nine patients (85%) had bone metastases
and 30 patients (65%) had RECIST-evaluable disease.
Fifteen patients (33%) had received prior chemotherapy,
including docetaxel in 8 (17%).
In phase 1, 16 patients were treated, comprising 3
per dose cohort except cohort 4, in which 1 patient was
withdrawn in Cycle 1 after docetaxel hypersensitivity,
requiring an additional patient to be treated. Thirty additional patients were treated in phase 2. At data capture
(March 2010), median treatment duration was 6.2
months (range, 0.1-17.2 months) for dasatinib and 6
cycles for docetaxel. Excluding the single patient who had
docetaxel hypersensitivity, the range of docetaxel cycles
administered was 2 to 24. Thirty-four patients (74%)
received 6 cycles of docetaxel, including 11 patients
(24%) who received 10 cycles. Twenty-eight patients
(61%) received single-agent dasatinib after discontinuing
docetaxel for a median of 2.9 months (range, 0.9-11.7þ
months) up to data capture. Nine patients (20%) remain
on study: 7 on single-agent dasatinib (current treatment
duration, 13.9-17.0 months) and 2 on combination therapy (14.7 and 17.25 months of dasatinib and 22 and
24 cycles of docetaxel). Of 37 patients (80%) who are off
study, reasons for discontinuation were protocol-defined
disease progression in 20 (43%), investigator decision due
to patient not likely to benefit from further treatment in 3
(7%), study drug toxicity in 7 (15%), patient request in 2
(4%), and other reason (unrelated AE, noncompliance,
no longer meets study criteria, or not specified) in 5
(11%).
Safety
No dose-limiting toxicities occurred, and MTD was not
reached. Combination treatment was generally well tolerated at the dose levels tested, and treatment-related AEs
were mostly mild to moderate in severity (Table 2). Thirteen patients (28%) experienced at least 1 grade 3 AE,

of which only fatigue (n ¼ 3) and pleural effusion (n ¼ 2)
occurred in >1 patient. Dose reductions of dasatinib or
docetaxel were required in 4 and 5 patients, respectively.
Docetaxel was delayed in 13 patients, and dasatinib was
interrupted in 30 patients.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis
PK parameters for dasatinib and docetaxel given alone or
in combination were similar. Figure 1 and Table 3 show
data for dasatinib 100 mg once daily and docetaxel 75
mg/m2. Point estimates (90% CI) of Cmax and AUC values for each agent given alone/in combination are 0.96
(0.74-1.24) and 1.08 (0.91-1.29) for dasatinib and 1.02
(0.92-1.14) and 0.97 (0.88-1.06) for docetaxel, respectively, indicating no PK interaction.
Dasatinib 100 mg once daily and docetaxel 75 mg/
m2 every 21 days were chosen as recommended phase 2

66

dose based on safety observations and PK analysis, plus
prior studies of dasatinib in chronic myeloid leukemia.26
Efficacy
Of 46 treated patients, 37 (80%) had any decrease in PSA
from baseline, including 26 (57%) who had a confirmed
PSA response (sustained 50% decline for 6 weeks;
Fig. 2A). Median duration of PSA response for the 13 of
26 responding patients who had PSA progression, disease
progression, or death on study was 4.9 months (range,
1.4-9.5 months); this median value was not calculated
using Kaplan-Meier methodology and does not include
patients who remained in PSA response or who discontinued from the study without PSA progression, disease progression, or death.
Among RECIST-evaluable patients, 18 of 30 (60%)
had a PR, and 5 of 30 (17%) remained on therapy

without response or progression for 18 weeks, resulting
in an overall disease control rate of 77%. PRs occurred in
4 of 8 patients (50%) with visceral metastases and 14 of
22 patients (64%) with target lesions in lymph nodes
only. Figure 2B shows maximum changes in tumor size.
Among all 46 patients, bone scan response was
improved (disappearance of at least 1 lesion) in 14
patients (30%) and stable (no new bone lesions at 18
weeks) in 19 patients (41%). Nine patients (20%) had no
new bone lesions at 6 and/or 12 weeks but were not
scanned further because of discontinuation from the
study. Three patients (7%) showed bone scan progression.
One patient was not evaluable. As described in the Materials and Methods section, results on bone scan were not
required to be confirmed.
Of patients evaluable for bone markers, 33 of 38
(87%) had a reduction in urinary NTx (Fig. 2C). This
included 18 patients (47%) who achieved a 35% urinary NTx reduction, of whom 2 were receiving
bisphosphonates. Furthermore, 26 of 33 patients (76%)
had a reduction in BAP (Fig. 2D), including 9 receiving
bisphosphonates. Median decreases from baseline (range)
in patients with reductions were 36% (6%-81%) for urinary NTx and 26% (6%-85%) for BAP.
Post hoc analyses were performed to determine if
bone effects correlated with antitumor activity. Of evaluable patients with bone scan improvement, 12 of 13
(92%) had a urinary NTx decrease, 10 of 12 (83%) had a

13 (92%), and 17 of 19 (90%), respectively. In patients
with low, medium, and high numbers of bone scan lesions
at baseline, all 3 biomarkers showed variable decreases
(Table 4). In a further analysis, 25 patients were classified
as responders based on achievement of PSA response
(patients with nonmeasurable disease) or RECIST PR
without PSA progression (patients with measurable disease). Of evaluable responders, 19 of 21 (90%) and 16 of

(after 0.9-8.1 additional months of single-agent dasatinib), including 5 patients who had stabilization of disease
for at least 3 months. Six patients discontinued dasatinib
without progression due to study drug toxicity (n ¼ 2),
AE unrelated to study drug, patient request, investigator
decision due to patient not likely to benefit from further
treatment, and social reasons (n ¼ 1 each). Six additional
patients remained on single-agent dasatinib without progression at data capture and had stabilization of disease for
3.4 þ to 11.7 þ months after the last docetaxel dose.

DISCUSSION
The results of this phase 2 study establish the feasibility
and safety of combining dasatinib with docetaxel and
prednisone at therapeutically relevant doses in patients
with metastatic castration-resistant PC. The high rates of
soft tissue responses, bone effects (as captured by bone
scanning), and modulation of bone turnover markers are
promising and support our hypothesis that cotargeting
the tumor and associated microenvironment may increase
the efficacy of docetaxel.27,28
Dasatinib plus docetaxel had a favorable toxicity
profile, allowing escalation to dasatinib 120 mg once daily
with docetaxel 75 mg mg/m2 every 21 days and prednisone. In conjunction with noninteracting PK profiles,
these results strongly suggest that the combination can be
given safely without compromising dose or schedule. The
rate of fluid retention (pleural effusion, edema) was
comparable to experience with docetaxel alone. Only
15% of patients experienced pleural effusion (grade 3
in 4%) and 1 patient (2%) had grade 1 pericardial

effusion, whereas in a phase 2 study of 47 patients
with castration-resistant PC who received twice daily
dasatinib monotherapy, pleural and pericardial effusion
occurred in 51% and 23%, respectively.29 Oral prednisone, combined with the improved safety of once daily
versus twice daily dasatinib,30 may have minimized
fluid retention in our study.
Notwithstanding prior chemotherapy exposure in
33% of patients, the objective tumor response rate (60%),
which is higher than those seen with docetaxel every 21
days alone in the TAX327 and SWOG9916 trials (12%17%), is very encouraging. Furthermore, the PSA
response rate of 57% compares favorably with TAX327/
SWOG9916 (45%-50%).27,28 The finding that 33 of 46
patients (72%) had either improved bone scan (disappearance of at least 1 lesion) or stable bone scan during the
study was also of interest. These observations might be the
result of the antitumor and bone-targeted effects of docetaxel and dasatinib treatment, which have been suggested
by preclinical studies.11,12,15 Whether dasatinib increases
antitumor effects of docetaxel in patients and prolongs
survival requires evaluation in a randomized setting.
In this study, 23 of 46 patients had experienced disease progression by last follow-up, defined using radiographic and symptomatic criteria. Nine patients remained
on-study at last follow-up. Of patients who discontinued
treatment, 1=3 discontinued for reasons other than disease
progression (eg, drug toxicity) and were not followed further for progression or survival. Because of the proportion
of patients for whom date of progression could not be
determined, PFS could not be accurately calculated, and
this represents a limitation of the study.
Of particular interest was the duration of stable
disease in patients who received maintenance singleagent dasatinib after stopping chemotherapy. Experimental observations in murine PC models suggest that
dasatinib inhibits tumor proliferation, invasion, and
metastasis, indicating that the antitumor effects of

69

dasatinib are likely to be cytostatic rather than cytotoxic. Supporting these studies, 28 patients (61% of
study participants), who responded by PSA or RECIST,
continued on single-agent dasatinib after completing
docetaxel therapy. Among these patients, durations of
stabilization of disease of up to 12 months after docetaxel was stopped were recorded by data cutoff. The median of 6 docetaxel cycles administered was lower than
published experience with docetaxel every 21 days alone
(9.5 cycles in TAX327),28 and additional cycles of docetaxel might have also resulted in ongoing stabilization of
disease. The comparatively shorter duration of docetaxel
use in this study likely reflects early cessation of chemotherapy after the protocol-specified minimum of 6 cycles
based on investigator/patient choice. The occurrence of
ongoing stabilization of disease after discontinuation of
docetaxel has been reported infrequently within published literature. In the ASCENT trial of docetaxel with
or without calcitriol, patients who had a confirmed 50%
PSA response and PSA level 4.0 ng/mL were allowed
to receive intermittent chemotherapy; that is, docetaxel
was suspended until the PSA level rose (by 50% and to
2 ng/mL) or other evidence of progression was seen.
Among 250 randomized patients, 45 (18%) had their
chemotherapy suspended, and median duration until
resumption was 4.2 months (18 weeks), with a
reported range of 1 to 16.2 months (4-70 weeks).31
Although these data indicate that patients can experience
periods of stabilized disease without continuous docetaxel, in the ASCENT trial only a minority of patients
who had achieved relatively stringent response criteria
had their therapy suspended. Whether single-agent dasatinib has the potential to prolong responses without
ongoing docetaxel therapy warrants further investigation.
Treatment with dasatinib targeted both osteoclastic
and osteoblastic components of bone disease, as shown by
most patients having decreases in concentrations of urinary
NTx and BAP. Interestingly, bisphosphonate-treated
patients had additional reductions in bone marker levels,
suggesting that SRC inhibition may have bone-targeted
effects beyond those achieved with bisphosphonates. Previous studies have assessed bone marker effects of novel
agents combined with docetaxel in patients with metastatic
PC. In a phase 1-2 trial of docetaxel and atrasentan, an
endothelin-A receptor antagonist, concentrations of BAP
but not urinary NTx decreased in patients not receiving
bisphosphonates.32 In a randomized phase 2 trial of
docetaxel plus imatinib, a PDGFR inhibitor, combination treatment was associated with significantly greater

70

declines in urinary NTx compared with docetaxel alone,
whereas docetaxel-related declines in BAP were
impaired.33 Together with bone marker outcomes with
zoledronic acid,34 these results suggest that modulating
bone turnover alone is insufficient to meaningfully alter
the course of PC bone metastases in most patients.
Post hoc analyses were performed to investigate the
correlation between bone scan responses and standard
PSA/tumor responses or effects on bone markers. Of
patients who responded by PSA and/or RECIST criteria,
92% also had an improved or stable bone scan versus
71% in the overall group. Of those with improved or
stable bone scans, the proportions of evaluable patients
with decreases in urinary NTx, BAP, or PSA were 93%,
88%, and 91%, respectively, versus 87%, 76%, and 80%
in the overall group. No correlation was seen in comparisons between volume of bone scan lesions at baseline and
effects of treatment on PSA or bone markers.
In summary, this study demonstrates that dasatinib
and docetaxel combination therapy is well tolerated and
has encouraging efficacy. Parallel bone scan improvements, urinary NTx/BAP decreases, and tumor effects
(RECIST and PSA responses) are consistent with the hypothesis that the efficacy of dasatinib and docetaxel combination therapy is attributable to cotargeting of the
tumor and the soft tissue and bone microenvironments.
These data have provided the rationale for an ongoing
randomized phase 3 study.
