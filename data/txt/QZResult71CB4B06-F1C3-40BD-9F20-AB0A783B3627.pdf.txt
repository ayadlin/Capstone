Abstract
Despite the fact that a high proportion of elderly stroke patients develop mood
disorders, the mechanisms underlying late-onset neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive
symptoms have so far received little attention in the field of neurobiology. In rodents,
aged animals display depressive symptoms following stroke, whereas young animals
recover fairly well. This finding has prompted us to investigate the expression of
serotonin receptors 2A and 2B, which are directly linked to depression, in the brains
of aged and young rats following stroke. Although the development of the infarct was
more rapid in aged rats in the first 3 days after stroke, by day 14 the cortical infarcts
were similar in size in both age groups i.e. 45% of total cortical volume in young rats
and 55.7% in aged rats. We also found that the expression of serotonin receptor type
B mRNA was markedly increased in the perilesional area of aged rats as compared to
the younger counterparts. Furthermore, histologically, HTR2B protein expression in
degenerating neurons was closely associated with activated microglia both in aged
rats and human subjects. Treatment with fluoxetine attenuated the expression of
Htr2B mRNA, stimulated post-stroke neurogenesis in the subventricular zone and
was associated with an improved anhedonic behavior and an increased activity in
the forced swim test in aged animals. We hypothesize that HTR2B expression in the
infarcted territory may render degenerating neurons susceptible to attack by activated
microglia and thus aggravate the consequences of stroke.

Introduction

and non-human primates are required to investigate the
molecular mechanisms of aging in humans, to predict
human responses to age-related diseases and also the
response of aged organisms to therapeutic interventions.
Since epidemiological studies have revealed that human
stroke occurs more often in old ages (more than 80 years)
than late middle age (60-79 years) [1], it is advisable to
use rats of appropriate age to study the behavioral and
molecular mechanisms underlying functional recovery

Stroke is the second-leading global cause of
death behind heart disease, accounting for 11.13% of
total deaths worldwide in 2015 [1]. Studies of stroke
have demonstrated age and gender effects on incidence,
functional recovery and mortality, not only in humans
but also in animal models [2-4]. Therefore, studies on
physiologically complex organisms including rats, mice

after stroke in animal model. Therefore, the aged rodent
model offers a useful tool to investigate the molecular
pathways and potential novel therapies that may improve
functional outcome after cerebral ischemia in preclinical
studies [5].
Post-stroke depression (PSD) is among the most
frequent neuropsychiatric consequences of stroke.
Depression also negatively influences stroke outcome
with increased morbidity, mortality and poorer functional
recovery [6, 7]. Morphologically, depression is associated
with atrophy and loss of neurons and glia, which
contribute to decreased size and function of limbic brain
regions that control mood and depression, including the
prefrontal cortex and hippocampus [8].
In addition to an increased risk of mortality,
depressed patients are more likely to develop coronary
artery disease, type 2 diabetes and cognitive deficits
[9-12]. Depression also complicates the prognosis of
other chronic diseases [13, 14]. However, the biological
mechanisms underlying depression remains poorly
understood due to a lack of biomarkers, relatively low
rates of heritability, and heterogeneity of precipitating
factors, including stress [15-17]. For example, a recent
study has linked HTR2b polymorphisms to susceptibility
to migraine/hypoperfusion without aura in a Spanish
population [18].
In the normal adult brain, 5-HT receptor mRNA
is present at high concentrations in the frontal cortex,
basal ganglia and at lower levels in some components
of the limbic system (including hippocampus, septum
and amygdala) [19], while the highest expression of
5-HT2C receptor is found in the choroid plexus, with
lower but substantial densities in other regions, lateral
septal nucleus, subthalamic nucleus, amygdala and parts
of the hippocampus, substantia nigra, central gray and
cerebellum [20]. However, 5-HT2C did not show an agedependency in post-stroke rats and was, therefore, not
investigate din this study. 5-HT2B receptor mRNA is
mainly found in the hippocampus as well as the cortex,
midbrain and the hypothalamus [21].
At the genetic and cellular level, we previously
found significant differences in behavioral, cytological and
genomic responses to injury in aged animals compared
to younger controls [22-25]. Behaviorally, aged animals
display depressive symptoms following stroke, whereas
young animals recover fairly well [26]. This finding has
been confirmed repeatedly in subsequent studies [25, 27],
prompting us to investigate the expression of serotonin
receptors 2A and 2B, which are directly linked to
depression, in the brains of aged and young rats following
stroke.

pellets. Nevertheless, aged animals do lose some weight
in the first week following stroke. The mortality rate was
higher for aged rats (33%) than for younger rats (15%)
during this time.As previously reported, the hematologic
parameters showed some age-associated differences,
notably in blood pressure, but the differences were not
statistically significant in this stroke model [22, 32].

Hedonic behavior
Before surgery, 79% of young animals and 75%
of old animals were hedonic (Figure 1B). After stroke,
the number of hedonic young animals did not change
significantly over the 28 days testing period. However,
in the old group the number of anhedonic animals has
increased to 42% by day 21 and to 57% by day 28 (Figure
1B). The fluoxetine treatment however has reduced
anhedonic behaviour to 35% by day 28 (Figure 1B, dashed
line).

Forced swim
The forced swim test (FST) is commonly used
for assessing antidepressant-like behavior in animal
models. There are three predominant behaviors in the
modified FST: immobility, swimming and climbing. The
effects of lesion (stroke) and anti-depressant treatment
with fluoxetine are shown in Figure 2. Stroke produced
a decrease in cumulative activity (i.e. composed of
swimming, climbing and immobility times) that decreased
steadily from day 1 to day 28 (Figure 2A). Fluoxetine
treatment, however, reversed partially the cumulative
activity (Figure 2A, red line). When analyzed by activity
type, swimming itself had a modest contribution to
the total activity index. As expected, stroke led to an
impairment of climbing activity that reached the lowest
value at day 21 post-stroke. Likewise, immobility has
increased steadily from pre-surgery levels to day 21. The
anti-depressant treatment led to an improvement in the
swimming behavior mostly (5-fold increase, p=0.001)
followed by an improvement in immobility (1.8-fold, p=
0.02) (Figure 2B).

Age-specific post-stroke up-regulation of Htr2B
mRNA in the peri-infarct area of rats
Immunohistochemistry with NeuN, a marker of
neuronal nuclei was used to reveal details of the infarcted
area [27]. Although the development of the infarct was
more rapid in aged rats in the first 3 days after stroke [31]
by day 14 the cortical infarcts were similar in size in both
age groups i.e. 45% of total cortical volume in young rats
and 55.7% in aged rats (Figure 3A-3C).

depression, we found by transcriptomics analysis using
the Affymetrix platform, that the transcripts encoding
the serotonin receptor 2B (Htr2b) but not Htr2a were
upregulated after stroke in the aged rat stroke model.
The expression also displayed a strong age effect, being
more strongly upregulated at day 3 in aged than in young
rats. The Htr2b mRNA levels returned almost to the prestroke level by day 14 [25]. To validate these results, we
performed RT-qPCR. At day 3 post-strokewe found by RTqPCR,a 15-fold up-regulation in the expression of Htr2b
mRNA, that was 7-fold higher in the lesioned area of aged
animalsthan in young animals (Figure 3D). Ht2b mRNA
levels decreased thereafter in the perilesional area in both
age groups. Fluoxetine treatment, however, caused, by day
28, a significant increase (1.9-fold) in the Htr2b mRNA
levels in the perilesional area of aged rats (Figure 3D).
To determine the phenotype of Htr2B-positive
cells, we performed double-immunofluorescence staining
using a mouse antibody against HTR2B (green) and a
rabbit antibody raised against NeuN (red). We found that
HTR2B-positive cells were co-localized with NeuNpositive nuclei at day3 after stroke in aged rat brains
(Figure 3E, arrows). Although the mRNA expression
was largely down-regulated by day 14 post-stroke, the
HTR2B/NeuN protein co-localization persisted in the periinfarcted area (Figure 3F, arrows).

by beta III tubulin (red), a marker of mature neuronal
cells (Figure 4B, arrows). In addition to the neuronal
co-localization, we also noted the co-localization with
astrocytes labeled with FITC-GFAP (Figure 4C, arrows)
in the penumbral region of post-mortem stroke patients.
However, there was no co-localization with astrocytes
in the unlesioned, contralateral region of the same poststroke patient (Figure 4D, arrowheads).

HTR2B is surrounded by activated microglia in
the peri-infarcted area of aged rats and human
subjects
To gain insight into the cellular function of the
protein, we further performed double-immunofluorescence
staining for HTR2B and Iba1, a marker of brain microglia.
In the peri-infarcted area of young animals activated
microglia (Figure 5A, arrowheads) was seen in close
association with HTR2B+ neurons (Figure 5A, arrows).
The close proximity of HTR2B and brain microglia was
less evident at day 14 post-stroke (Figure 5B). In aged
rats, however, a co-localization of the microglia marker
Iba1 with HTR2B-expressing neurons and blood vessels
(Bv) (Figure 5C) was seen at day 3 post stroke. Despite
persistent expression of Iba1 in the peri-infarcted territory
(Figure 5D, inset), the co-localization between Iba1 and
HtR2B was less evident by day 14 after stroke in aged
animals (Figure 5D).
In the peri-lesional area of human stroke victims we
noted numerous phagocytic microglia expressing AIF1
(Figure 5E, red), co-localized with HTR2B-expressing
neurons (Figure 5E, green). Furthermore, numerous
blood vessels were positive for HTR2B (Figure 5F, green,
arrows) in remote areas with reference to the infarct core.

Chronic fluoxetine treatment stimulates poststroke neurogenesis in aged animals

in the aged brains of animals treated with fluoxetine as
compared to the modest expression in the brains of control
animals (Figure 6A vs 6B) so that the number of DCX+ in
treated animals was almost similar to the number of DCX+
found in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of young animals
ipsilateral to stroke (Figure 6C, 6D).

Fluoxetine is an antidepressant of the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family that has a
recognised clinical efficacy and safety profile [33]. Since
the underlying mechanism may involve neurogenesis
[34], we investigated the immunoreactivity of the early
neuronal marker doublecortin by immunofluorescence in
the lateral ventricle region of aged rats after stroke. We
noted vigorous post-stroke neurogenesis as evidenced by
an increased number (2.2-fold, p = 0.02) of DCX+ cells

Discussion
Despite the fact that a high proportion of elderly
stroke patients develop mood symptoms, there is, as
yet, little insight into the underlying neurobiological
mechanisms. Following stroke, aged animals exhibit a

Aged rats after stroke display a markedly
depressive behaviour

depressive behavior especially in the first week poststroke. We found that the expression of serotonin receptor
type B mRNA was markedly increased in the peri-lesional
area of aged rats as compared to the younger counterparts.
Further, histologically, HTR2B protein localisation was
closely associated with degenerating neurons and activated
microglia both in aged rats and human subjects.

Following infarction, aged rats are refractory
to movement and display a loss of appetite, eating and
drinking a fraction of what young animals consume.
Indeed, it has previously been demonstrated that aged
animals lose some weight in the first week following
stroke [26]. Our previous data showed that this was at least
partially attributable to the surgical procedure itself during

activity type, swimming had a modest contribution to the total activity index. Stroke led to an impairment of climbing activity that reached
the lowest value at day 21 post-stroke while immobility increased steadily from pre-surgery levels to day 21. The anti-depressant treatment
led to an improvement in the swimming behaviour mostly (5-fold increase, p = 0.001) followed by an improvement in immobility behaviour

the first 3 days [26, 27, 35], but thereafter it was obviously
due to a depressive behaviour manifested by the lack of
interest in sucrose consumption and an increase in the
immobility time in the forced swim test. This depressive
behaviour could be due to differentiation of serotoninergic
neurons in the grey matter [36]. Generally, there is a
abnormal 5-HT neurotransmission with increasing age
that contributes to the deterioration of cognitive processes
in ageing, including depression [37]. It is well known that
young animals recover readily form stroke. In fact, aged
animals exibit a delay of several days in their recovey
[26]. In addition to increased cortical damage in aged
animals, we believe that young animals simply have better
homeostatic mechanisms allowing for behavioral recovery
by functional compensation. However, as we and others
previously described, this behaviour improves abruptly
upon exposure to an enriched environment [26, 33, 39].
Conversely, keeping the post-stroke aged rats in isolation
exacerbated the depressive behaviour [26] suggesting
that depression may be at the core of decreased motility
and feeding and apathic behaviour [38, 39]. Indeed,

earlier studies have implicated 5-HT2BRs in anxiety,
schizophrenia, autism, migraine, and depression [40, 41].

Identification of an age-related increase in Htr2B
mRNA after stroke
The pattern of brain distribution suggests that the
activation of 5-HT2 receptor subtypes may be implicated
in the regulation of mood disorders [42]. Indeed we found
that Htr2B mRNA but not Htr2A mRNA, was robustly
increased in the perilesional frontal area of aged rats
suggesting that the interruption in the serotoninergic
innervation of cortical neurons by stroke may lead to
an increased expression of Htr2B mRNA and serotonin
receptors in the motor and frontal cortex.
Despite the wide occurence in the brain, the function
of the 5-Htr2B receptor is not precisely known. In the
brain stem, the 5-HT2B receptor modulates the respiratory
network discharge properties [40] and within the vascular
system, Ht2B receptors are involved in the regulation
of the smooth muscle tone [43]. Moreover, because the

available ligands do not discriminate between type B and
type C receptors, it may be that many functions attributed
to the type C receptor could have been fulfilled by the type
B receptor as well [44].
Among the few studies directly addressing the
function of the Ht2B receptor, it was shown that the Htr2B
receptor agonist alpha-methyl-5-(2-thienylmethoxy)1H-indole-3-ethanamine
(BW723C86),
increased
food consumption and elicited anxiolysis in a social
interaction model [45]. More recently, studies in Htr2B
KO mice have shown that the Ht2B receptor is required
for the hyperlocomotion induced by the “club drug”
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; also
known as ecstasy) and modulate the release of serotonin

[5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] stores from nerve terminals
[46, 47].
Cognitive impairment and depression are the
most commonly reported neuropsychiatric symptoms,
both occurring in approximately one third of patients
after stroke [48]. Apathy is most commonly defined as a
syndrome of diminished goal-directed behavior, emotion,
and cognition [49]. This occurs in a third of patients after
stroke as an independent syndrome, although it may also
occur as a symptom of depression or dementia [50, 51].

damage, and “affective” PSD, associated to left frontal
lobe lesions [52]. Moreover, a relationship between apathy

reported [53, 54]. Since the behavior of our aged rodents
was more „apathetic“ we hypothesize that the increased
HT2B mRNA and protein expression in neurons around
the peri-lesional area was due to the interruption of
asceding inputs from basal ganglia which normally supply
neurons in the frontal cortex with biogenic amines like
5-HT and dopamine. Our hypothesis is supported by
animal studies reporting an upregulation of Htr2B mRNA
and protein in response to the serotonergic deafferentation
to compensate for the loss of serotonin input [55] and

several clinical studies in elderly patients that reported an
association between old age and apathy in stroke survivors
[42, 56, 57] and normal elderly subjects [51]. Furthermore,
apathy is significantly more represented in late onset
depression than in early onset depression [58].
Previous studies have described that the selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors may have a beneficial effect
in PSD therapy, but the role of SSRI treatment after stroke
in aged animals has not been studied. Indeed, fluoxetine
treatment alleviated the effect of stroke on the anhedonic

Conclusions

behaviour indicated by an improvement in the swimming
and immobility behaviour and redressed, to some extent,
the expression of the Hrt2B mRNA. Our results are
supported by recent suggestion that serotonin receptors are
required for fluoxetine to exert its action. Thus, deletion
of serotonin 1A receptor from the dentate gyrus in the
hippocampus abolished the anti-depressant activity of
the drug [59]. In addition, we wanted to exploit the antiinflammatory effect of fluoxetine during the subacute
phase in aged animals [60].
Increased cell proliferation and neurogenesis in
response to chronic but not acute fluoxetine treatment may
be one mechanism underlying the anti-depressant activity
of fluoxetine [61]. This mechanism may also occur in the
aged rats. Indeed, recent work has shown that chronic
post-stroke treatment with fluoxetine increased the number
of neuroblasts both in the SVZ and hippocampus of aged
Wistar rats. However, since fluoxetine treatment did not
influence either the survival of newly generated cells nor
the performance in sensorimotor recovery [62] it is not
currently known whether the newly generated neurons are
functional in vivo. It has been reported that such neurons
may be functionally active in hippocampal slices, a model
very different from an in vivo situation [63].
Whether stroke stimulates endogenous neurogenesis
is still debated especially in aged subjects where
neurogenesis is normally decreased [64-68]. Recent data
indicate that the action of fluoxetine on neurogenesis is
highly dependent on the age of the treated individual [69].
Although several studies suggest no significant influences
of fluoxetine on neurogenesis in the SVZ [61, 70] of
experimental animals, it has been shown that stroke per
se greatly increases neurogenesis in the subventricular
zone[71]. Moreover, neurogenesis in the subventricular
zone and nearby striatum after stroke is similar in young
and old animals, indicating that this potential mechanism
for self-repair also operates in the aged brain [72]. In
addition, the beneficial effects of fluoxetine could be
also due to the pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effect [60,
73]. Nevertheless, fluoxetine did stimulate post-stroke
neurogenesis in the SVZ of aged animals and was
associated with an improved anhedonic behavior and
an increased activity in the forced swim test. However,
whether endogenous neurogenesis contributes to an
improved hedonic behavior has still to be established.

Because of the lack of a precise function of the
HT2B receptor in the brain, we can only speculate about
the functional significance of the massive upregulation
of this receptor after stroke in the aged brains. A similar
upregulation of HT2B receptors has been recently
reported for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal
neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower
motor neurons [67]. Loss of serotoninergic transmission
led to a compensatory constitutive upregulation of
Htr2B receptors on motor neurons causing an intrinsic
hyperexcitability and subsequent spasticity [55]. A
prolonged neuronal hyperexcitability may also lead to
degeneration of serotoninergic neurons, and consequently
attract activated microglia as we consistently observed this
in the lesioned area of aged animals and autopsy samples
of stroke patients. Finally, treatment with fluoxetine
stimulated post-stroke neurogenesis in the SVZ and was
associated with an improved anhedonic behavior and an
increased activity in the forced swim test in aged animals.

Material and methods
Animals
30 young (3 to 4 mo of age) and 46 aged (19 to 20
mo) male Sprague-Dawley rats, bred in-house, were used.
Body weights ranged from 290 to 360 g for the young rats
and from 520 to 600 g for the aged rats. After behavioural
testing, the two age groups were divided randomly into
3-, 14- and 28 day post-stroke survival groups. The group
sizes for the aged rats were larger to compensate for the
higher post-ischemic mortality rate. After 14 days poststroke the aged group was further divided into a treatment
group (N = 15) and a control group (N = 13). The numbers
reported in the results refer to the number of animals
that survived the surgery and completed the 4-week
testing period. The rats were kept in standard cages in a
temperature (22oC), humidity (40–60%), and light period
(07.00–19.00h) controlled environment and had free
access to food and water. The Animal Experimentation
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the
University of Medicine and Pharmacy Craiova as meeting
the ethical requirements of the EU legislation on the
protection of animals used for experimental purposes
approved all experiments.

Study limitations
The variability of injury size and injury location
following MCAO model is considerably high; (ii)
extent of fluoxetine treatment beyond 14 days; (iii) since
fluoxetine may also have an anti-inflammatory effect
during the subacute phase in aged animals, it is not clear
in what ways this effect may have impacted post-stroke
neurogenesis; (iv) mechanistically, we cannot clearly
distinguish between post-stroke depression and apathy.

swimming behavior; and (3) immobility, determined as
absence of any directed movements of animals’ head and
body was scored during the first 2 min of the test [29].

was performed between 9:00 and 13:00. Animals from
the control and experimental groups were randomly
subjected to cerebral infarction that was induced by the
focal interruption of blood flow by transiently lifting the
middle cerebral artery with a tungsten hook, as previously
described [27]. To prevent continued perfusion of the
target region by arterial collaterals, both common carotid
arteries were then occluded by tightening pre-positioned
thread loops. Throughout surgery, anaesthesia was
maintained by spontaneous inhalation of 1-1.5% isoflurane
in a mixture of 75% nitrous oxide and 25% oxygen. Body
temperature was maintained at 37°C by a Homeothermic
Blanket System (Harvard Apparatus) and the tail artery
was catheterized to allow the continuous measurement
of blood pressure and the withdrawal of blood samples
for determination of pH and blood gases (Blutgassystem
IL 1620, Instrumentation Laboratory, Munich), as well
as arterial glucose levels (Omnican7 Balance, B. Braun,
Melsungen). Local changes in blood flow were monitored
using a laser Doppler device fixed in place using a tiny
cylinder nearby the occluded artery (Perimed, Stockholm,
Sweden), and blood gases were measured at several
timepoints during ischemia. A decrease in the laser
Doppler signal to <20% of control values was considered
to indicate successful MCA occlusion. After 90 minutes,
the hook was released and the common carotid arteries
were re-opened.

Hedonic behavior
Sucrose consumption during a period of 24 hours
was used as a measure of hedonic behavior as described in
detail previously [30]. Briefly, 4 days before surgery rats
were given, for 24h, a free choice between two bottles,
one filled with 2% sucrose solution, the other containing
tap water. After a break of two days, the rats were primed
again with 2% sucrose for 24 hrs. To control for potential
effects of side preference, the position of the bottles was
switched after 12 h. In order to balance the air temperature
between the room and the drinking bottles, they were kept
in the same room where the testing took place. In order
to decrease stroke variability due to sucrose consumption,
one day before surgery rats were given tap water. After the
MCAO was performed, spontaneous activity and hedonic
behaviour (sucrose and water levels) were monitored
every seventh day and recorded for 4 weeks (Figure
1A). Throughout the experiment the two bottles (water
and sucrose) were switched once per day, to prevent
possible effects of side preference in drinking behavior.
Consumption of liquids was evaluated by weighing the
bottles before and after the test. Sucrose intake was given
as the amount of consumed sucrose in mg per gram body
weight [30].

Treatments
Aged rats were given a fine suspension of fluoxetine
daily, an anti-depressant drug, in saline (10 mg/Kg body
weight) administered intraperitoneally at day 14 after
stroke and was continued for two weeks. The control
group was treated with vehicle (saline). To label newly
generated cells, all rats were treated with once-daily i.p.
injections of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; 50mg/ kg body
weight; Sigma, Germany) during the first week poststroke, continued at alternating days thereafter for a period
of 14 days in total.

Tissue, RNA and protein analysis
Subsequent to a survival time of 3-, 14- and 28
days, the rats were deeply anesthetized and perfused
with buffered saline followed by buffered, 4% freshly
depolymerized paraformaldehyde. The brain was
removed, post-fixed in buffered 4% paraformaldehyde for
24 h, cryoprotected in 20% sucrose prepared in 10 mmol/L
phosphate-buffered saline, flash-frozen in isopentane and
stored at -70°C until sectioning. For total RNA and protein
isolation, the rats (N = 7) were perfused with buffered
saline only, and the brain was cut into 2 mm slices that
were dipped in 2% 2,3,5-triphenyltetrozolium chloride
(TTC) solution so that the infarct core could be visualized
and microdissected under a dissecting microscope as
previously described [25].

Behavioural tests
The testing procedure involved two experimenters,
one who performed the surgery and was in charge of
handling the animals according to group assignment, and
another who carried out the behavioural tests and who was
not aware of the animals’ group assignments.

Forced swim
The forced swim test was used to assess the time
of active/passive behavior when animals are placed in
an inescapable cylinder with water (50 cm water depth)

previously described [31]. Briefly, images of the stained
sections were taken to cover the entire infarcted area,
which was then calculated as the sum of partial areas using
Image J. Integration of the resulting partial volumes gave
the total volume of the ipsilateral hemisphere along with
the total volume of the cortical infarct; lesion volume was
then expressed as percent of the hemispheric volume.

Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen Life Technologies, Germany), as described
by the manufacturer, followed by DNase 1 (Ambion)
digestion and further purification using the RNeasy Mini
extraction kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Purified total
RNA was used for cDNA array assay and real-time PCR
quantification.
For real-time PCR, 2µg of total RNA was reversetranscribed using random hexamers and the reverse
transcription reagents supplied by Life Technologies
(Karlsruhe, Germany). The PCR reaction was set up
by mixing 10ng of cDNA, primers, and Master mix
(PeqLab, Germany), and real-time PCR amplification was
performed as follows: one cycle of 15min at 95°C and 45
cycles in three steps each (95°C for 30-s, 58°C for 30-s,
72°C for 30-s) using a real-time PCR cycler (MyiQ Cycler
Bio-Rad). A standard curve was generated by plotting the
log10 [target dilution] of template on the X-axis against
the Ct value from serial dilutions of target DNA on the
Y-axis. The efficiency of PCR amplification was 98%.
The relative expression level of Htr2B and Rpl13a (as the
housekeeping gene) was determined based on the standard
curve equation generated for each individual gene.

Doublecortin-BrdU double staining
Cryostat, free-floating sections of 25µm were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes and then
washed extensively with PBS After incubation in 50%
Formamide/2X SSC for 2h at 60°C, sections were
washed again, first in 2x SSC and then in 10x PBS. After
denaturation in 2N HCL at 37°C for 40 minutes, sections
were made neutral by adding 0.1M Borate buffer (pH
8,5). Thereafter sections were incubated sequentially
with the guinea pig anti-doublecortin (1:2000; Millipore,
Germany) antibody overnight at 4°C followed by donkey
anti-guinea pig IgG-biotin (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany)
and streptavidin Alexa 488 (Life Technologies, Karslruhe,
Germany). Finally sections were incubated with rat
anti-BrdU antibody (1:2000, AbD Serotec, Puchheim,
Germany). BrdU-positive cells were visualized by
incubating with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-rat IgG
(H+L) (1:3000, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany).

Immunohistochemistry

Immunofluorescence on rat brain sections

Sections (25 µm-thick) were cut on a freezing
microtome and processed for immunohistochemistry as
free-floating material using an automatic staining device
(www.tingomat.com) capable of staining several hundreds
of sections simultaneously. Briefly, after incubation with
blocking solutions containing 3% donkey serum/10
mmol/L PBS/0.3% Tween 20, tissue sections were exposed
overnight at 4°C to mouse anti-NeuN (1:1000, Millipore,
Germany) diluted in PBS containing 3% normal donkey
serum and 0.3% Tween 20. After extensive washing in
PBS containing 0.3% Tween, sections were incubated
overnight at 4°C with biotinylated donkey anti-mouse
IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA) diluted 1:4000 in PBS containing 1% normal donkey
serum and 0.3% Tween 20. After washing in PBS, sections
were incubated for 4 hrs at room temperature in ABC
Elite reagent (Vectastain Elite Kit, Vector) diluted 1:100
in PBS containing 0.3% Tween 20. The antibody complex
was then visualized with 0.025% 3’,3’ diaminobenzidine
(DAB) and 0.005% hydrogen peroxide in 100 mmol/L Tris
buffer (pH 7.5).

Sections (25 µm-thick) were cut on a freezing
microtome and processed for immunohistochemistry as
free-floating material using an automatic staining device
(www.tingomat.com). For phenotyping, rat sections were
blocked and incubated overnight at 4°C either with rabbit
anti-NeuN (1:1000, Millipore, Germany) or anti-GFAP
(1:1000, Abcam) or rabbit anti Iba1 (1:3000, WAKO
Chemie, Germany) diluted in 3% goat serum, 1x PBS
and 0,2% Tween. After overnight incubation at 4°C,
sections were washed and incubated with the secondary
antibody, goat anti-rabbit-CFL 555 (1:1000 dilution, Santa
Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany). After a short fixation in 4%
paraformaldehyde, serotonin receptor 2B-expressing
cells were visualized by incubating sequentially with
mouse anti-HTR2B (1:2000, Pharmingen) followed by
goat anti-mouse HRP polymer (1:10 in 1% goat serum;
Histofine, Nichirei Technology). Finally, cells were stained
using tyramide-FITC. Then sections were mounted in
ProLong® Gold Antifade reagent with Hoechst 33342
(Life Technologies, Karlsruhe, Germany) to stain nuclei.

Determination of infarct volume
To assess the size of the infarct induced by transient
focal ischemia, every tenth section was stained NeuN as

quantitated covered one third of the area of each section)
times the section interval of 10. Because co-localization
in one confocal plane sometimes may be misleading as
to the number of cells co-localizing, we counted doublelabeled cells by 3-D reconstruction as described above.
By rotating the 3-D image, we were able to determine
precisely the number of co-localized cells [5].

To analyze HTR2B expression after ischemic stroke,
formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archived brain tissue
blocks containing both cortical lesional and peri-lesional
areas were selected from 12 stroke patients with a survival
post-stroke time ranging from 12 h to 7 days. Death
was attributed to complications such as massive edema
and brain herniation with rostrocaudal deterioration, or
cardiovascular arrhythmias. Written informed consent to
autopsy was obtained for each patient from the relatives
or their caregivers. Demographic data of patients and
controls are given in Table 1.
7µm sections were cut and mounted on positively
charged slides (Superfrost®), then dewaxed and
rehydrated. Antigen retrieval was performed in heated
1mM citric acid (pH6) and non-specific antigen binding
was blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS. Sections were
exposed to anti-5-HT2BR antibody (1:50, BD Bioscience)
and either anti-AIF1 antibody (1:100, Abcam) or anti-beta
III Tubulin antibody (1:1000, Abcam) diluted in 1% goat
serum in PBS, then detected using Alexa Fluor 488 and
594 secondary antibodies (Life Technologies). Sections
were mounted in ProLong® Gold Antifade reagent with
DAPI (Life Technologies) and visualized on a Leica
DM6000 fluorescent microscope.

Statistical analysis
The age-dependency of anhedonia and the effect of
treatment on the hedonic behavior were analyzed using
the Mann Whitney test. The main effect of treatment
on sucrose and total liquid consumption, forced swim,
including swimming, climbing and immobility, was
evaluated by using two-way ANOVA. Cell quantification
was performed using the t-test. The level of significance
(two-tailed threshold) was set at p ≤ 0.05. Data are
presented as mean ± SD for all other data, as indicated for
each figure.

A quantitative estimate of the number of DCX- and
BrdU-immunopositive cells was obtained by counting the
cells in 25-µm-thick sections in volume units measuring
250µm x 250µm x 10 µm, employing a ‘randomsystematic’ protocol (random start point for a systematic
series of every 10th section through the infarcted volume)
as previously described [5]. The area occupied by cells
of interest was 30% of the total stained area. The relative
mean number of co-localized cells was then calculated per
group, time point, and age by multiplying the number of
cells per section times 3.3 (the counting boxes that were
