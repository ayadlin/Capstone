ABSTRACT
The overexpression of the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) confers
resistance to Adriamycin (ADR) in breast cancer. The silencing of ABCG2 using small
interfering RNA (siRNA) could be a promising approach to overcome multidrug
resistance (MDR) in cancer cells. To deliver ABCG2-siRNA effectively into breast
cancer cells, we used mPEG-PLGA-PLL (PEAL) nanoparticles (NPs) with ultrasoundtargeted microbubble destruction (UTMD). PEAL NPs were prepared with an emulsionsolvent evaporation method. The NPs size was about 131.5 ± 6.5 nm. The siRNA
stability in serum was enhanced. The intracellular ADR concentration increased after
the introduction of siRNA-loaded NPs. After intravenous injection of PEAL NPs in
tumor-bearing mice, the ABCG2-siRNA-loaded NPs with UTMD efficiently silenced
the ABCG2 gene and enhanced the ADR susceptibility of MCF-7/ADR (ADR resistant
human breast cancer cells). The siRNA-loaded NPs with UTMD + ADR showed better
tumor inhibition effect and good safety in vivo. These results indicate that ADRchemotherapy in combination with ABCG2-siRNA is an attractive strategy to treat
breast cancer.

of numerous anticancer agents, including anthracyclines and
camptothecins, by enhancing drug efflux [9, 10]. Therefore,
knocking down ABCG2 gene expression might effectively
reverse drug resistance in breast cancer cells.
RNA interference (RNAi), an emerging gene
knockdown technology, is more specific and efficient
compared with traditional gene knockdown techniques
[11, 12]. RNAi is of 21 to 23 nt small interfering RNAs
(siRNA) that facilitate the silencing of complementary
target mRNA, thereby silencing gene expression [13–15].
However, the delivery of siRNA remains a major hurdle
in the full exploitation of siRNA-based therapeutics. It is
difficult for siRNA to pass through the cell membrane,
as both of these entities are negatively charged [16, 17].
Therefore, safe and effective approaches for the targeting
in vivo delivery of these molecules are appealing [18].

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy is very important in the comprehensive
treatment of breast cancer and has been suggested to be a
major treatment to avoid the recurrence of cancer after surgery
[1]. However, tumors might be intrinsically resistant to
chemotherapy or acquire multidrug resistance (MDR) during
treatment [2–4]. A well-established cause of MDR involves
increased drug efflux from cancer cells mediated through
members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
family [5, 6]. Among ABC transporter family members, a
novel protein, the breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2),
has been detected in a variety of malignancy tumors, such
as breast cancer [7, 8]. Experimental evidence suggests
that ABCG2 overexpression is associated with reduced
intracellular drug concentration and the decreased cytotoxicity

Monomethoxy polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid/
glycolic acid-poly-L-lysine triblock copolymer (mPEGPLGA-PLL, PEAL) is a cationic polymer with blocks to
get nanoparticles with hydrophilic shell and hydrophobic
core, suitable for carrying various genes [19–21]. The
protonated amino group of PLL could bind with negatively
charged siRNA to increase the entrapment efficiency [22].
The directional rupture of microbubbles (MB) by lowfrequency ultrasound (UTMD) facilitates the penetration
of PEAL NPs into the cell membrane and subsequent into
cells [23–25]. In the present study, we used PEAL NPs as
siRNA deliver system assistant with UTMD to treat breast
cancer.
To investigate the effects of ABCG2-siRNA in
reversing MDR in mice bearing Adriamycin-resistant
human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADR) xenograft
tumors, using Adriamycin-sensitive human breast cancer
cells (MCF-7/S) xenograft tumors as a control, we
prepared siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs by the emulsionsolvent evaporation method for systemic siRNA delivery
(Supplementary Scheme S1) [26]. The resensitization
effects of breast cancer towards ADR after ABCG2-siRNA
transfection and in vivo safety of siRNA-loaded PEAL
NPs were also investigated.

a resistance index (R) of nearly 440. As expected, the
exposure of MCF-7/ADR cells to ABCG2-specific siRNAs
prior to the addition of ADR significantly decreased the
IC50 of ADR (IC50 values of 144, 124, 97 and 76 μg/mL
for free siRNA, free siRNA with UTMD, siRNA-loaded
PEAL NPs, and siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs with UTMD
treatments, respectively). In the presence of UTMD, the
IC50 values were reduced in all groups. According to
the fold-reversal (FR) values of resistant cells (Table 1),
siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs with UTMD induced the 3-fold
resensitization of MCF-7/ADR cells to ADR.

Increased drug accumulation in siRNAtransfected cells
To conduct a more intuitive examination for the role
of ABCG2-siRNA in reducing drug efflux, we observed
the intracellular concentration of ADR in untreated
and siRNA-transfected cells. The results showed that
the transfection of siRNAs into MCF-7/ADR cells
enhanced intracellular drug accumulation (Figure 2).
A more substantial increase was observed in ABCG2siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs transfected MCF-7/ADR cells,
compared with non-transfected or free ABCG2-siRNA
transfected cells. And as expected, the cells transfected
with siRNA in the presence of UTMD showed more
intense drug accumulation than those without UTMD.

RESULTS
Preparation and characterization of NPs

In vivo tumor growth inhibition

The hydrodynamic diameter of siRNA-loaded
PEAL NPs, measured using dynamic light scattering
(DLS), was 131.5 ± 6.5 nm with a PDI of 0.162 (Figure
1B). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed
that siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs were spherical particles
and dispersed well (Figure 1A). Gel retardation assay
confirmed that siRNA could be completely packaged
into PEAL NPs when the content of siRNA in feed was
no more than 1 nmol (Figure 1C). The contents of intact
siRNA in various formulations after treatment with
1mU of RNase or 50% serum solution for different time
were shown in Figure 1D and Figure 1E, respectively.
According to Figure 1E, free siRNA degraded after
exposed to RNase within 2 h. In contrast, almost no
degradation was observed in siRNA loaded PEAL NPs
within 2 h, demonstrating that PEAL NPs protected siRNA
from enzymatic degradation in serum.

To investigate the tumor therapeutic efficiency of
systemic siRNA delivery in vivo, nude mice bearing MCF7/S or MCF-7/ADR tumor xenografts were subjected to
various formulations at 1.3 mg/kg ABCG2-siRNA and 5
mg/kg ADR every 3 days. As shown in Figure 3A, nonignorable effects on tumor growth were observed after
treatment with ADR alone compared with the (normal
saline) NS group. Both siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs alone
and in the presence of UTMD showed significantly
increased inhibition on tumor growth. As expected,
siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs + UTMD exhibited stronger
tumor growth inhibition compared with siRNA-loaded
PEAL NPs alone, particularly for mice bearing MCF-7/
ADR tumor xenografts.
After final treatment, all tumors were collected
and photographed (Figure 3C). The results revealed that
ADR in combination with siRNA mediated by PEAL
NPs + UTMD could effectively inhibit tumor growth, and
these results were consistent with the results of the tumor
volume assay.
With respect to safety evaluation (Figure 3B),
compared with the NS group, the mice in the treatment
group showed varying degrees of decreased body weights
during the entire experimental period, likely resulting
from the toxicity of ADR.

analysis and TUNEL staining of tumor tissues after

cells
The IC50 values of MCF-7/S and MCF-7/ADR cells
treated with different transfection agents are shown in
Table 1, demonstrating that 0.558 μg/mL of ADR induced
50% reduction in MCF-7/S cell proliferation. However,
for MCF-7/ADR cells, the necessary concentration for
50% inhibition of cell proliferation was 242 μg/mL with

treatment. Compared with the NS group, siRNA-loaded
PEAL NPs + UTMD markedly decreased the number of
cancer cells, indicating that the administration of siRNAloaded PEAL NPs + UTMD increased sensitivity to
ADR and effectively enhanced cell apoptosis, leading to
considerable antitumor efficacy.

The in vivo gene silencing of ABCG2-siRNAloaded PEAL NPs was evaluated in animals bearing MCF7/S and MCF-7/ADR tumor xenografts. To demonstrate

with siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs + UTMD plus ADR was
associated with ABCG2 downregulation in tumor cells,
the mice were executed after treatment for 30 days, and all
tumors were collected to extract total mRNA or protein to
assess the levels of ABCG2 mRNA and protein expression
using RT-PCR and WB analyses, respectively. As shown
in Figure 5, ABCG2-siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs + UTMD
significantly suppressed the expression of the target gene
in tumor xenografts, consistent with the gene silencing
effects observed in vitro.

Histopathological photos were showed in Figure 6B.
Ecrosis in liver and glomerular shrinkage were observed in
ADR group. There were no obvious pathological changes
was observed in other groups.
The toxicity result showed that the ADR at 5mg/kg
was harmful to liver and kidney. The siRNA preparations
reduced the toxicity of ADR to a certain extent.

DISCUSSION
ABCG2, the second member of the subfamily G of
the human ABC transporter superfamily, has been detected
in a large number of hematological malignancies and
solid tumors, indicating that this transporter might play an
important role in the MDR of cancers [10]. Transfection
studies from different laboratories confirmed that the
overexpression of ABCG2 in different cell types confers
resistance to various anticancer agents and reduces drug
accumulation in the cell [9, 29, 30].
Many studies have been reported down-regulated
ABCG2 expression and reverse drug resistance in breast
cancer. Sridhar K et al. reported that fumitremorgin
C could reverse the MDR in cells transfected with the
ABCG2 gene [31]. However, the neurotoxicity of this
toxin, characterized by tremors and tetanic convulsions
in mice, prevented the use of this chemical in in vivo
experiments [32]. Yasuo Imai et al. reported that estrone
and 17β-estradiol could reverse ABCG2-mediated MDR
[33]. However, the coadministration or intake of these
drugs with ABCG2-substrate antitumor agents might
result in the alteration of the pharmacokinetics of these
compounds and increase the toxicity of the antitumor
drugs in the recipient patients [34]. With increasing
understanding of the mechanisms of RNAi, siRNA has
been proposed as an effective approach to specifically
silence ABCG2 in cancer cells. MCF-7/ADR cells

Systemic toxicity evaluation
To evaluate the safety of siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs
assisted ADR in vivo, the physiological states of mice
were recorded daily during injection. Weight loss was
observed during the experimental period in ADR group.
The blood was collected on the last day of the
experiment to determine a part of hepatic, heart and renal
function indices. As shown in Figure 6A, the aspartate
transaminase (AST) in ADR group was higher than that
in NS group (P < 0.01). The level in siRNA+ADR group
was lower than in the ADR group, but still higher than
the NS group (P < 0.05). However, the AST in the other
siRNA groups were lower than in ADR group (P < 0.05)
and no significant difference than in NS group. Similar
trend was observed in alanine transaminase (ALT) level
except the level in siRNA+ADR group, like in the other
siRNA groups, was no diference with in the NS group.
There was no significant difference in creatine phosphate
kinase isoforms - MB (CK-MB) level as an indicator of
cardiac function. The uric acid (UA) level in ADR group
was higher than in NS group (P < 0.05). The levels in
the siRNA groups were all lower than in ADR group but
without significant difference. Similar trend were in urea
(UREA) and creatinine (CRE) levels.

overexpress ABCG2. Therefore, we selected MCF-7/ADR
as model cells, and MCF-7/S cells were used as a control.
Here, we have designed and synthesized ABCG2-siRNA
to specifically and effectively down-regulate breast cancer
resistance-related protein (BCRP) expression in tumor
cells in vitro. A major obstacle to the clinical application
of RNAi is the disadvantageous pharmacokinetic profile,
which strongly hinders this molecule from achieving
effective concentrations at target sites in vivo. Therefore,
delivery strategies that stabilize siRNA and enhance
intracellular uptake in vivo are needed.
The BCRP is highly expressed on the apical
membranes of the placental syncytiotrophoblasts, the
intestinal epithelium, the liver hepatocytes, the endothelial
cells of brain microvessels, and the renal proximal tubular
cells, contributing to the absorption, distribution, and
elimination of drugs and endogenous compounds as well
as tissue protection against xenobiotic exposure [35].
This may be the reason that the miRNA preparations
showed protecting effect to liver and kidney in the safety
evaluation (Figure 6).
In a previous study, we reported the synthesis of
a new polymer, PEAL, with excellent biocompatibility
in vitro and high encapsulation efficiency for the
stable delivery of siRNA [36]. In the present study,
we prepared the ABCG2-siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs
using the emulsification-solvent evaporation method.
The resulting NPs were uniform in size, which would
be suitable for passive tumor targeting of drug delivery
through the EPR effect [37, 38]. The outer layer of NPs
was covered with hydrophilic mPEG, which improve
the stability and biocompatibility of this nanoparticle
[39, 40]. Also it can enhance the mean residence time
(MRT) of NPs in blood cycle to get more opportunity
to tumor [41]. Apparently, these nanoparticles protected
siRNA from serum-driven nuclease digestion efficiently.
The siRNAs, delivered by NPs, effectively knocked
down ABCG2 gene expression and reduced drug efflux,
thereby increasing the sensitivity of resistant cells to
ADR. The NPs led to specifically silences genes without
inducing obvious organ toxicity (Figure 6), suggesting
the potential clinical application.
UTMD was observed Ultrasound induced
microbubble cavitation can cause enhanced permeability
across natural barriers of tumors such as vessel walls or

cellular membranes, allowing for enhanced therapeutic
delivery into the target tissues. Titanium dioxide
nanoparticles was reported used for tumor image. The
optical signal intensity suggests that light penetration depth
is significantly enlarged by ultrasound [42]. Ultrasound
was reported to enhance PLGA-PEG-NP effect. As the
pressures increased from 1.7 to 6.9 MPa, the amount of
nanoparticles deposited in cancer xenografts was increased
from 4- to 14-fold, and the median penetration depth of
extravasated nanoparticles was increased from 1.3-fold to
3-fold, compared to control conditions without ultrasound
[43]. Ultrasound enhanced drug distribution in tumor
may by the way of inducing extravasation, improving
penetration through the extracellular matrix and enhancing
cell uptake [44].
Taken together, these results demonstrated that
ABCG2-siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs are promising tools to
inhibit ABCG2 overexpression in MCF-7/ADR cells and
sensitize its response to drugs. Some insight researches,
such as ADR pharmacodynamics affected by miRNA NPs
will be carried out in future work.

The PCR conditions were enzyme activation at 95°C for
3 min, followed by 34 cycles of 95°C for 30 sec, 55°C for
30 sec, and 72°C for 110 sec, with a final extension cycle
at 72°C for 5 min. The PCR products were analyzed
through electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels containing
1 μg/mL ethidium bromide. The gels were visualized using
an EC3 Imaging System (UVP, LLC, Upland, CA, USA).

MCF-7/S cells were purchased from the Cell Bank
of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai, China),
and the multidrug-resistant variant MCF-7/ADR was
established and maintained in our laboratory. All cells
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Biosera, UK)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco), and
1% penicillin and streptomycin (Biosera). MCF-7/ADR
cells were grown in the RPMI 1640 complete medium
with 1 μg/mL ADR to maintain drug-resistance. The
cells were cultured at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2.

Preparation and characterization of NPs
ABCG2-siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs were prepared
by double emulsified method. Briefly, 2 mg PEAL in
dichloromethane (1 mg/mL) was emulsified in a solution
containing 1 nmol of siRNA in diethyl pyrocarbonate
(DEPC)-treated water by sonication for 50 s in an
ice bath. The primary emulsion obtained was further
emulsified in 2 mL Pluronic 188 solution (1.0%, w/v) by
sonication to form a water-in-oil-in-water emulsion. The
dichloromethane was subsequently removed using a rotary
evaporator (Taikang Biotechnology Inc., Shaanxi, China).
The siRNA-loaded NPs were denoted as NP1.0, where the
subscript represents the number of the siRNA molecule
as nmol.
The particle size and polydispersity index (PDI)
of the NPs were measured at 25°C using a Zetasizer
IV analyzer (Malvern Zetasizer Nano ZS90, UK). The
morphology was observed through transmission electron
microscopy (TEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan). To assess the
integrity of the siRNAs after entrapment in PEAL NPs, a
gel retardation assay was performed.

Experimental facilities of ultrasound
The therapeutic ultrasound apparatus Topteam 161
(Chattanooga Company, CA, USA), with a frequency of
1 MHz, pulse repetition frequency of 100 Hz and 25 mm2
cross sectional probe area, was used to enhance siRNA
delivery. Prior to insonation, the ultrasound probe was
placed on the bottom of the culture plate with a small
amount of couplants on the surface of the probe to form a
conductive pathway of ultrasound waves from transducer
to cells.

Western blot
Total protein was extracted using lysis buffer
supplemented with 1% PMSF, and the concentration
was determined using a BCA protein assay kit (Sigma,
St Louis, MO, USA). Approximately 20 μg of total
protein from each sample was loaded onto 10% SDSpolyacrylamide gels and subsequently transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Massachusetts,
USA). The membranes were incubated with rabbit
antibody against ABCG2 (1:300) at 4°C overnight.
Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
was used as an internal standard to normalize protein
expression, and the membranes were incubated with
GAPDH monoclonal antibody (1:2500) simultaneously.
The membranes were subsequently washed with TBST
(Tris-HCl+Tween) and incubated with HRP-conjugated
secondary goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibody (1:2000)
at 37°C for 1 h. The protein-antibody complexes were
analyzed using chemiluminescence. All antibodies used
in this study were purchased from Tuoran Biotechnology
Inc. (Shanghai, China).

Gel retardation assay
Gel retardation electrophoresis was used to detect
the loading capacity of PEAL to siRNA, as well as antienzymatic activity and serum stability of the siRNA
molecules after entrapment in PEAL NPs. Samples of
naked siRNA and siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs, containing
different siRNA contents (siRNA concentration was fixed
at 100 nM), were respectively mixed with serum at a ratio
of 1:1 (v/v) or 1 mU of RNase, and the resulting mixtures
were incubated at 37°C. At different time points, aliquots
of each sample were collected for analysis. All the samples
were loaded onto 1% agarose gels containing 1 μg/mL
ethidium bromide.

Cell proliferation assay
MCF-7/S and MCF-7/ADR cells were seeded
onto 96-well plates at a density of 5 × 103 cells/well,
incubated overnight and subsequently transfected with
different siRNA and UTMD treatment. After transfection
for 48 h, the culture medium was removed, followed by
the addition of ADR at a series of concentrations. The
cells were incubated for 48 h under normal maintenance
conditions, and cell viability was measured using an MTT
assay. The absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a

Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)
The transfected cells were harvested, and total
RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent, according
to the manufacturer’s instructions. Approximately 5 μg
of total RNA from each sample was converted to cDNA
using a commercially available RT-PCR kit (TaKaRa,
Kyoto, Japan). The primers used are shown in Table 2.

microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules,
CA, USA). The cell viability was normalized to that of
cells treated with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The
resistance index (R) and fold-reversal (FR) values were
calculated using the following equations [27, 28]:
R=IC50 ADR, MCF-7/ADR /IC50 ADR, MCF-7/S;
FR=IC50 ADR, MCF-7/ADR /IC50 ADR+siRNA, MCF-7/ADR.

homogenized in 1 mL of pre-cooling TRIzol reagent and
subsequently incubated at room temperature for 5 min to
facilitate the complete separation of protein-nucleic acid
complexes. After centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 5 min at
4°C, the supernatant was collected and analyzed through
RT-PCR as described above.

H&E staining and TUNEL analysis

Intracellular drug accumulation

To conduct histological analysis, the tumors
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 h. After
deparaffinization, the tissue sections (5 mm) were stained
with hematoxylin/eosin (H&E). The tumor cell apoptosis
was determined using the One-step TdT-mediated dUTP
Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) Apoptosis Kit according
to the manufacturer’s instructions (Beyotime, China). All
sections were examined using an inverted fluorescence
microscope. TUNEL-positive cells were shown in green.

The effect of ABCG2-siRNA on cellular ADR
accumulation was determined using an inverted
fluorescence microscope (Huarui Chemical Instrument
Inc., Guangdong, China). Briefly, 1 × 105 MCF-7/ADR
cells were seeded onto 6-well plates and subsequently
transfected by siRNA preparations in the absence or
presence of UTMD. The final concentration of siRNA was
100 nM. After 48 h, the cells were incubated with 1 μg/mL
ADR for 1 h at 37°C. Subsequently, the cells were washed
three times with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
and the nuclei were stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino2-phenylindole staining solution). Subsequently, the cells
were subjected to fluorescence analysis to determine the
intracellular ADR accumulation.

Safety evaluation
The mice were treated respectively with 0.9%
NS (control), ADR, free siRNA, free siRNA + UTMD,
siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs or siRNA-loaded PEAL NPs
+ UTMD once every 3 days for 5 times. The siRNA dose
was 1.3 mg/kg. The ADR dose was 5 mg/kg. At 24th hour
after the final injection, serum samples were collected and
measured to assess hepatic and renal damage. After the
mice were sacrificed, the major organs, such as liver, heart,
spleen, lung and kidney of each mouse were collected,
fixed, and processed for H&E staining to evaluate toxicity.

In vivo tumor growth inhibition study
Female BALB/c nude mice, weighing 15–18 g,
were purchased from Shanghai Slac Laboratory Animal
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The xenograft tumor model
was generated through the subcutaneous injection of
MCF-7/S or MCF-7/ADR cells (5 × 106 for each mouse)
in the flank regions of the mice. When the tumor volume
was approximately 100 mm3, the mice were randomly
divided into 6 groups and treated with different therapy: (1)
0.9% normal saline (NS); (2) NS + ADR; (3) free siRNA
+ ADR; (4) free siRNA + UTMD + ADR; (5) siRNAloaded PEAL NPs + ADR; and (6) siRNA-loaded PEAL
NPs + UTMD + ADR. NS, siRNA and siRNA-loaded
PEAL NPs were through intravenous injection. ADR was
through intraperitoneal injection [45]. The body weight
and tumor size of each mouse were measured every 3 days.
The diameter of the tumors was measured using a vernier
caliper. The estimated tumor volume was calculated using
the formula: volume= 0.5 × length × width2. At 24 h after the
final injection, all tumors were collected for further analysis.

Statistical Analysis
All data were performed in triplicate and shown
as the means ± standard deviation (SD). Student’s t-test
was used to compare two groups of data. GraphPad Prism
(GraphPad Software Inc., California) was used to obtain
graphs and statistics. Significant values were designated as
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, and ***p < 0.001.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

For ABCG2 protein measurements, the tumors
were cut into pieces and subsequently homogenized
in lysis buffer supplemented with 1% PMSF
(phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride). After centrifuged at
12,000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C, the supernatant was collected
for further analysis.
The expression of ABCG2 mRNA in the tumors was
analyzed through RT-PCR. The tumor tissue (~50 mg) was
