BACKGROUND: There are conflicting data regarding age as a prognostic factor in osteosarcoma. The authors conducted a study
evaluating the impact of age on prognosis in children and young adults with osteosarcoma enrolled on North American cooperative
group trials. METHODS: Patients with high-grade osteosarcoma of any site enrolled on North American cooperative group trials CCG7943, POG-9754, INT-0133, and AOST0121 were included in this study. Primary tumor site, age, sex, ethnicity, histologic response, and
presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis were evaluated for their impact on overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS).
RESULTS: A total of 1054 patients were eligible and had complete data available for the study. Age was not significantly associated
with any other presenting covariate analyzed except sex. Age 18 or older was associated with a statistically significant poorer EFS
(P ¼ .019) and OS (P ¼ .043). The 10-year EFS and OS in patients <10, 10 to 17, and 18 years old were 55%, 55%, 37% and 68%, 60%,
41%, respectively. The poorer EFS in patients 18 years old was because of an increased rate of relapse. Presence of metastatic
disease at diagnosis, poor histologic response, and pelvic tumor site were also associated with a poorer prognosis. In multivariate
analysis, age continued to be associated with poorer EFS (P ¼ .019) and OS (P ¼ .049). CONCLUSIONS: In osteosarcoma, age 18
to 30 years is associated with a statistically significant poorer outcome because of an increased rate of relapse. Poorer outcome in
adolescent and young adult patients is not explained by tumor location, histologic response, or metastatic disease at presentation.

INTRODUCTION
The failure to adequately improve outcomes for adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer is increasingly
recognized as a significant problem in oncology.1,2 Consequently, for each cancer with a worse outcome in AYA patients,
it is a research priority to identify the biologic, clinical, and social factors responsible for this disparity in prognosis.1 Before
embarking on a detailed analysis of this sort for a particular cancer, one must first fully understand whether there is a
significant relationship between AYA age and outcome.
Bone sarcomas are among the tumors most commonly diagnosed in the AYA population and have a peak incidence between 15 and 39 years, the age range commonly accepted to define the AYA population.2 In Ewing sarcoma,
increasing age has consistently been demonstrated to be associated with a poorer prognosis.3,4 Rhabdomyosarcoma and
nonrhabdomyosarcoma soft tissue sarcomas have likewise been demonstrated to have a worse outcome in older
patients.5,6 Whether AYA age constitutes a significant risk for a poorer outcome in osteosarcoma is not clear. Whereas
some prior studies have demonstrated a poorer prognosis in older patients,7,8 others have demonstrated a poorer prognosis in younger patients,9 and some show no association between age and prognosis.10,11 Using data from the most
recent North American Cooperative Group trials conducted by the Children’s Cancer Study Group (CCG), the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG), and the Children’s Oncology Group, we assessed the relationship between AYA age and
prognosis in osteosarcoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients enrolled on any of the 4 recent prospective North
American Cooperative Group trials for newly diagnosed
osteosarcoma, CCG-7943, POG-9754, intergroup study
INT-0133, and AOST0121, were eligible for this study.
The eligibility criteria for INT-0133 and CCG-7943
have previously been described.12,13 Patients were eligible
for AOST0121 if they had high-grade metastatic osteosarcoma with either bone metastases, bilateral lung metastases, or unilateral lung metastases with at least 4 nodules.
Patients were eligible for POG-9754 if they had resectable, nonmetastatic high-grade osteosarcoma. Because of
the eligibility criteria of these 4 trials, patients with both
metastatic and nonmetastatic osteosarcoma and patients
with both resectable and unresectable osteosarcoma are
included in this study (Table 1). For all trials, patients
were excluded if they had received prior chemotherapy or
radiation or if the osteosarcoma arose in a previously
irradiated bone or in bone affected by Paget disease. Age
of enrollment for all trials was younger than 31 years.
CCG-7943, POG-9754, INT-0133, and AOST0121
were approved by the institutional review boards at each of
the participating institutions. The patient or the patients’
legal guardians consented to treatment, and the patients
assented themselves if age appropriate.

(MAP). Additional agents were administered with the
MAP backbone in each trial. Patients enrolled on INT0133 received MAP with muramyl tripeptide and/or ifosfamide as previously described.13,14 All patients enrolled
on AOST0121 received ifosfamide and etoposide in addition to MAP, and patients with ERBB2-positive tumors
also were treated with trastuzumab. POG-9754 was a
pilot study with 3 arms, each with a unique method of
dose intensification. All patients enrolled on pilot 1
received MAP, and those patients on pilot 1 who were
slow responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy received
additional doxorubicin to a cumulative dose of 600 mg/
m2 (administered with dexrazoxane). All patients enrolled
on pilots 2 and 3 received ifosfamide in addition to MAP.
Patients enrolled on pilot 2 who were slow responders to
neoadjuvant chemotherapy received additional doxorubicin to a cumulative dose of 600 mg/m2 (administered
with dexrazoxane). Patients enrolled on pilot 3 who were
slow responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy received
higher-dose ifosfamide. Patients enrolled on CCG-7943
were treated with a topotecan window, followed by alternating cycles of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide
and doxorubicin and cisplatin as previously described.12
All protocols indicated patients with resectable disease
were to undergo resection with the intent of removing all
local and metastatic tumor.

Treatment

Statistical Analysis

All patients, with the exception of those enrolled on
CCG-7943, received chemotherapy including at least
high-dose methotrexate, doxorubicin, and cisplatin

The parameters age, sex, race, tumor site, presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis, histologic necrosis, and tumor
margins were analyzed for their impact on event-free survival

(EFS) and overall survival (OS) or postsurgical EFS, as
described below. Age was analyzed as a categorical variable
using the categories <10, 10 to 17, and 18 years. The
association of each of the other parameters with age was evaluated using the exact conditional test of proportions.15
EFS was taken to be the time from study enrollment
until disease progression, diagnosis of a second malignant
neoplasm (SMN), death, or last patient contact, whichever occurred first. Patients who experienced disease progression, SMN, or death were considered to have
experienced an EFS event; otherwise the patient was
considered as censored at last contact. The cumulative
incidence of each EFS event was estimated as a function of
time since enrollment by the method of competing
risks.16 The risk of each EFS event type across groups was
compared using the test of Gray.17 OS was taken to be the
time from enrollment to death or last patient contact,
whichever occurred first. Patients who died were considered to have experienced a death event; otherwise the
patient was considered as censored at last contact. Survival
curves were estimated by the method of Kaplan and
Meier.18 The risk of death was compared across groups
using the log-rank test.18 The conventional level of .05
was used to designate a comparison as statistically significant. A multivariate analysis using the proportional hazards regression model was performed.18 EFS and OS
analyses of age used tests stratified by metastatic status and
study (because of the varied eligibility criteria and treatments among the 4 studies).
To determine the relationship between histologic
response, age, and risk for EFS event, a secondary analysis
was performed. This analysis was restricted to patients
with localized osteosarcoma who underwent surgery after
enrollment and before an EFS event and who had histologic response grading data available. For CCG-7943,
POG-9754, and AOST0121, histologic response was
reported as a numerical value. For INT-0133, histologic
response was graded and reported as no effect, >50% viable tumor, 5% to 50% viable tumor, <5% viable tumor,
and no viable tumor. Therefore, for all patients in the
study, histologic response was categorized as good if there
was 95% necrosis and poor if there was <95% necrosis
in the resection specimen. The outcome measure used was
postsurgical EFS. Postsurgical EFS was defined similarly
to EFS, with the exception that the date of surgery (rather
than the date of enrollment) was the starting date for postsurgical EFS. To assess the effects of age and necrosis on
outcome, a stratified log-rank test18 was performed with
age stratified by histologic response. Similarly, the analysis
of margins used postsurgical EFS and was restricted to

patients with localized osteosarcoma who underwent surgery within 20 weeks of enrollment and had data reported
regarding margins.
INT-0133 was opened May 1993 and closed
November 1997. Data current to September 2005 were
used for analysis. CCG-7943 was opened August 1995
and closed November 1998. Data current to July 2003
were used for analysis. POG-9754 was opened September
1999 and closed February 2002. Data current to July
2008 were used for analysis. AOST0121 was opened
July 2001 and closed November 2005. Data current to
July 2008 were used for analysis.
RESULTS
Patients

A total of 1175 patients were enrolled on the 4 North
American Cooperative Group Trials; 121 patients were
excluded from this study because they had been declared
ineligible for the trial into which they were enrolled
(n ¼ 32) or because they had inconsistent or missing data
(n ¼ 89). After these exclusions, 1054 patients comprised
the analytic population; 745 patients were from INT0133 (70.7%), 28 patients were from CCG-7943 (2.7%),
79 patients were from AOST0121 (7.5%), and 202
patients were from POG-9754 (19.2%). Of the 878
patients with localized disease, 728 patients met criteria to
be included in the analysis of margins, and 768 met criteria
to be included in the analysis of chemotherapy response.
Patients in the study group were aged 1 to 30 years
with a mean of 13.9 years. The majority of patients (71%)
were 10 to 17 years of age at the time of enrollment onto 1
of the cooperative group trials (Table 2). One hundred
seventy-six patients (17%) were <10 years old, and 129
patients (12%) were 18 years old at the time of enrollment. Ages of patients in the oldest group ranged from 18
to 30 years with a mean of 21.5 years. One hundred seventy-six patients (17%) had metastatic disease at the time
of diagnosis. Sex was the only parameter significantly associated with age (Table 2). Males were more likely than
females to be 18 year old at the time of enrollment. The
association between age and sex in the study population is
similar to that seen in all patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma in the United States.19
OS and EFS

The 5- and 10-year EFS (with 95% confidence intervals
[CIs]) for the entire study population was 56% (53.1%59.2%) and 53% (49.5%-56.4%), respectively. The 5- and
10-year OS for the entire study population was 69%
(65.4%-71.4%) and 59% (54.9%-63.1%), respectively
(Fig. 1). The 5-year EFS and OS for the patients with

localized osteosarcoma was 63% (59.3%-65.8%) and 74%
(71.2%-77.3%), respectively. The 5-year EFS and OS for
the patients with metastatic osteosarcoma was 23% (16.9%30.2%) and 36% (27.4%-44.4%), respectively.
Age as a Prognostic Factor

The 10-year EFS in patients aged <10, 10 to 17, and 18
years was 55% (46.6%-62.7%), 55% (51.0%-58.9%),
and 37% (24.1%-49.6%), respectively. The 10-year OS
in patients aged <10, 10 to 17, and 18 years was 68%
(58.7%-75.5%), 60% (54.6%-64.4%), and 41%
(25.3%-55.7%), respectively. The hazard ratio (HR) for
death for age 18 years compared with those aged <10
years was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.15-2.54; overall P ¼ .021;
Table 3). When stratified according to the presence of
metastatic disease and study, age 18 years continued to
be associated with a statistically significant poorer EFS
(overall P ¼ .019) and OS (overall P ¼ .043; Fig. 2).
4600

Poorer EFS and OS for patients aged 18 years is also
seen when the analysis is restricted to patients with localized
osteosarcoma (overall P ¼ .032 for EFS and overall P ¼
.016 for OS; Fig. 3). In patients with metastatic disease at
presentation, AYA age is not associated with an increased risk
of death (overall P ¼ .88) or an EFS event (overall P ¼ .19).
In patients with localized disease, the risk of relapse
as the first EFS event is significantly (overall P ¼ .043)
higher in patients aged 18 years, whereas the risks of
death and SMN as a first EFS event are not increased
(Fig. 4). The same trend is observed in the entire study
population, but the increased risk of relapse does not
reach statistical significance (overall P ¼ .100).
Additional Prognostic Factors
Metastases

Patients with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis had a significantly worse EFS (P < .001) and OS
(P < .001) than those with localized disease (Table 3).

Sex

Five hundred ninety-three (56%) of the patients
were male, and 461 (44%) of the patients were female.
The HR for death for male sex was 1.26 (95% CI, 1.011.56; P ¼ .038; Table 3).

The relative risk regression analysis was conducted including the parameters study, tumor site, metastasis, and age.
Age 18 years remained a significant predictor of survival, with an HR compared with age <10 years of 1.55
(95% CI, 1.04-2.31) and an HR compared with age 10 to
17 years of 1.42 (95% CI, 1.05-1.92). Tumor site and
presence of metastatic disease were also significant predictors of OS in the multivariate analysis (Table 4). In the
relative risk regression analysis for EFS, age 18 years
approached statistical significance, with an HR compared
with age <10 years of 1.38 (95% CI, 0.99-1.93) and an
HR compared with age 10 to 17 years of 1.46 (95% CI,
1.12-1.90).
DISCUSSION
In this patient population, AYA age of 18 to 30 years is
associated with a significantly increased risk of relapse or
death. The effect of AYA age 18 to 30 years on outcome is
greatest in patients with localized disease. Secondary analyses that stratified the population according to histologic
response similarly demonstrated a significantly increased
risk of death and EFS event in patients aged 18 to 30
years. Such analyses, however, were conducted on groups
with a limited sample size. AYA age was not associated
with an increased risk of an EFS event or of death in
patients with metastatic disease, probably because prognosis is so poor in the group of metastatic patients included
in this study.
Several other publications have investigated prognostic factors in osteosarcoma including age. Results have
varied, with some studies showing a poorer prognosis in
older patients,7 others demonstrating a poorer prognosis
4603

Original Article

in younger patients,9 and still others reporting a lack of
association between age and prognosis.10,11 One important methodological consideration contributing to variable results is the manner in which age has been converted
to a categorical variable. Studies using age > and <40
years have found no association between age and outcome.10,11 Age has been dichotomized at a younger cutoff
to assess the impact of preadolescence and postadolescence on outcome, with disparate results.7,9,20 Of note,
few prior studies have used categorical age values relevant
to the question of prognosis in the AYA population. One
other study used similar age groupings as were used here.
Although the results do not reach statistical significance,
the disease-free survival appeared to be worse in patient
aged >21 years.21 Potential reasons for disparate findings
of these studies include differences in patient populations,
treatment eras, treatment regimens, and other prognostic
factors evaluated in the analysis.
This study has several possible limitations. Because
the composition of the patient population is defined by
the eligibility criteria of the 4 North American cooperative group trials onto which patients were enrolled, the
patient population included in this study may not be representative of osteosarcoma populations as a whole. However, in an analysis restricted to localized osteosarcoma,
age retained its prognostic significance. Furthermore, the
age distribution of the study population is similar to that
seen in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
database of the National Cancer Institute, with the exception of a slightly smaller proportion of patients aged 20
to 35 years. It is possible that outcome is worse in the 18to 30-year-olds in this study because of a selection bias
that older patients with more advanced or aggressive
osteosarcoma were more likely to seek out treatment at pediatric sites and/or enrollment on a pediatric cooperative
group trial without a similar trend for younger patients.
Because of a lack of prospectively collected data, we
were not able to evaluate the impact of treatment delivery
or tumor size on prognosis. Other studies have demonstrated that larger tumor size is a significant predictor of
poor outcome in osteosarcoma.9-11,22 Age and tumor size
are highly correlated variables in osteosarcoma22,23 and
rhabdomyosarcoma.24 When relative tumor size has been
carefully evaluated in osteosarcoma, it typically does not
have a significant impact on prognosis22,23 suggesting a
complex relationship between age and tumor size in this disease. Although it is possible that older age is a proxy for larger
tumor size in our study, it is just as likely that larger size has
been a proxy for older age in prior studies. Future prospective studies should acquire sufficient data regarding absolute
4604

and relative tumor size to permit detailed analysis of the relationship between age, tumor size, and prognosis.
The factors potentially responsible for poorer outcomes in AYA patients with cancer are multiple and
include delayed diagnosis, tumor biology, decreased rates
of participation in clinical trials, worse compliance with
chemotherapy schedules, distinct chemotherapy metabolism, and increased toxicity resulting in delays in chemotherapy administration. Among patients enrolled in INT0133, comprising 70% of the patient population analyzed
for this study, there was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in toxicity-related treatment delays or
dose reductions between the 3 age groups. There was not
an increased rate of metastatic disease in 18- to 30-yearolds, suggesting that delayed diagnosis may not be the
cause of worse outcome in this patient group. Unfavorable
tumor biology and distinct chemotherapy metabolism in
18- to 30-year-olds with osteosarcoma are factors deserving of dedicated investigation in future studies.
Similar to previous reports, we found pelvic site, the
presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis, positive tumor
margins, and a poor histologic response to chemotherapy
to be significant predictors of a poor prognosis.9,11,21
Male sex was identified as a significant predictor of poor
outcome on univariate analysis. But male sex was associated with age 18 years, and only age 18 years remained
a statistically significant predictor of outcome after regression analysis was performed.
On the basis of the results of this study, it is reasonable to proceed with a detailed evaluation of the biologic,
clinical, research, and social factors that may contribute to
inferior outcomes in AYA patients aged between 18 and
30 years with osteosarcoma. However, the conduct of this
research must take into account the existence of other
prognostic factors (metastases, tumor site, and response to
chemotherapy) with a larger magnitude of effect.
