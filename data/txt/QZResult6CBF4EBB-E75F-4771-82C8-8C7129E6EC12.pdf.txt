ABSTRACT
Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are rare, lethal, pediatric tumors predominantly
found in the kidney, brain and soft tissues. MRTs are driven by loss of tumor suppressor
SNF5/INI1/SMARCB1/BAF47. The prognosis of MRT is poor using currently available
treatments, so new treatment targets need to be identified to expand treatment options
for patients experiencing chemotherapy resistance. The growth hormone insulin-like
growth factor 2 (IGF2) signaling pathway is a promising target to overcome drug
resistance in many cancers. Here, we evaluated the role of IGF2 axis in MRT cell
proliferation. We showed that microenvironment stress, including starvation treatment
and chemotherapy exposure, lead to elevated expression of IGF2 in the SNF5-deficient
MRT cell line. The autocrine IGF2, in turn, activated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor
(IGF1R), insulin receptor (INSR), followed by PI3K/AKT pathway and RAS/ERK
pathway to promote cancer cell proliferation and survival. We further demonstrated
that impairment of IGF2 signaling by IGF2 neutralizing antibody, IGF1R inhibitor
NVP-AEW541 or AKT inhibitor MK-2206 2HCl treatment prevented MRT cell growth
in vitro. Taken together, our characterization of this axis defines a novel mechanism for
MRT cell growth in the microenvironment of stress. Our results also demonstrated the
necessity to test the treatment effect targeting this axis in future research.

INTRODUCTION

30% [4, 5]. The poor prognosis is due to high cellular
proliferation, propensity for metastasis and resistance to
radio- and chemo-therapy [6]. However, the mechanisms
of MRT survival in poor environment remain largely
unknown.
The insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) is a 7.5 KDa
mitogenic peptide hormone produced mainly by the liver,
but also secreted by tissues where it acts in an autocrine
or paracrine manner [7]. IGF2 is a major growth factor
in fetal development, its mRNA expression is downregulated postnatally in kidney and liver [8]. The IGF axis

Malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) are rare, highly
aggressive neoplasms that primarily develop in infancy and
early childhood arising from kidney or extra-renal sites
such as brain or soft tissues [1]. MRTs are characterized
by biallelic alteration of the SMARCB1/INI1/SNF5/BAF47
tumor-suppressor gene, which encodes a core component
of the chromatin-remodeling complex SWI/SNF [2, 3].
Despite the existing standard intensive multimodal therapy,
the long-term survival rate of MRT patients is less than

is a complex signaling network, composed of peptideligands IGF1, IGF2 and insulin, and receptors IGF1R
(insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor), IGF2R (insulinlike growth factor 2 receptor), INSR (insulin receptor),
as well as IGFBPs (IGF binding proteins) [9, 10]. IGF2
has similar affinities for the IGF1R and the short isoform
of the INSR (IR-A). This hormone signals through both
IGF1R and INSR, activating downstream signaling to
promote cell growth [11]. Unlike IGF1R and INSR, IGF2R
negatively regulates ligand bioavailability and mammalian
growth [12]. In addition, IGF2 binds to several IGFBPs
that regulate the bioavailability of IGF2 [13]. Evidence
shows IGF2 is commonly overexpressed in cancer.
Based on data derived from epidemiological studies and
experimental models, IGF2 has recently been implicated
in drug resistance [14–17]. Treatments that target IGF2,
such as ligand-specific antibodies, are showing promise in
preclinical studies [18–20].
IGF1R is crucial for tumor transformation and
survival of malignant cells. In many tumors, binding of
IGF2 to IGF1R inhibits apoptosis and promotes cell
proliferation [21]. As an anti-cancer target, IGF1R has
become an attractive target for novel cancer therapeutics
[22]. Other groups have reported significant IGF1R
expression in AT/RT (Atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor),
which are related to MRT and occur in the central nervous
system. In their research, treatment of AT/RT cell lines
BT12 and BT16 with IGF1R antisense oligonucleotides
resulted in a significant decrease in cellular proliferation
[23]. The most advanced strategies used have been
monoclonal antibodies against IGF1R, and small molecule
inhibitors. Some have entered phase III clinical trials for
treating human cancer [24]. IGF2 can bypass IGF1R
signaling and avoid inhibition by stimulating IR-A,
inducing mitogenic signals [22]. In this case, dual IGF1R/
INSR inhibition may improve the treatment outcome.
In response to the stimulatory ligand IGF2, IGF1R
activates downstream RAS/ERK kinase pathway and the
phosphinositide-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, which
are related to cell proliferation and anti-apoptosis [25].
The PI3K/AKT pathway is a central axis in survival and
proliferation of SNF5-deficient cells. Eden et al. found
aberrant and persistent activation of AKT under low serum
conditions was corrected when SNF5 was restored [26]. In
many tumors, activated oncogenic signaling, such as RAS,
AKT and Myc, contributes to ongoing neovascularization
by upregulation of proangiogenic factors [27].
To date, the role of IGF2 in MRT is largely unknown.
Here, we sought to characterize IGF2 axis in MRT cells.
Poor microenvironmental conditions are a characteristic
feature of solid tumors [28]. Work in our laboratory
using serum deprivation and chemotherapeutic agents
to stimulate MRT cells induced IGF2 overexpression,
indicating IGF2 plays important roles in MRT cell
proliferation and survival under the microenvironment
stress. We found the serum-free growth capacity of MRT
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

cell lines G401 and BT16 is dependent on autocrine IGF2
by using the IGF2 neutralizing antibody. In addition,
NVP-AEW541, a small molecule inhibitor of IGF1R,
blocked recombinant human IGF2 (rhIGF2) induced AKT
phosphorylation, and caused cell death in both G401 and
BT16 cell lines. Furthermore, the allosteric AKT inhibitor
MK2206 2HCl impaired the growth of MRT cell lines in a
dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our data provide
evidence that the IGF2 axis plays important roles in cell
proliferation and confronting rough environmental in
MRT. Therefore, it is worthy to test the possibility of this
pathway to be a potential therapeutic target in the treatment
of MRT in the future research.

RESULTS
SNF5-deficient MRT cell lines G401 and BT16
exhibited serum-independent persistent cell
growth accompanied by IGF2 axis upregulation
MRT is one of the most aggressive pediatric
malignancies [29]. Tumor-secreted growth factors
affect tumor microenvironment, as well as stimulate the
cancer cells to proliferate and develop a more malignant
phenotype in an autocrine manner [30]. Therefore, in order
to examine the potential for autocrine growth of the MRT
cell lines under investigation, we assessed the MRT cell
proliferation ability in serum-independent conditions [31].
We found that more than 90% of HEK293T cells died
within 4 days in serum-free medium. In contrast, SNF5deficient cell line G401 exhibited sustainable growth in the
serum-free medium for more than 7 days. However, the
growth rate was much lower compared with cells cultured
in normal conditions. The BT16 cell line showed weaker
proliferation in serum deprivation compared with G401.
The total BT16 cell number reached maximum at day 3,
with some cells surviving more than 7 days after FBS
withdrawal (Figure 1A). These data suggest an unknown
factor exists to mediate cell proliferation in serum-free
medium, best exemplified by G401.
According to the previous report, MRT cells showed
highly strong and specific IGF2 mRNA expression, and
autocrine IGF2 may contribute to the serum independence
of G401 cells [31, 32]. Therefore, we determined whether
IGF2 axis showed aberrant activities in starved MRT
cell lines. Considering both G401 and BT16 exhibited
the highest growth rate on the third day of starvation
treatment, we harvested HEK293T, G401, BT16 cells at
this time point. They were cultured in α/Ham medium
containing 10% FBS or serum-free α/Ham medium,
and then analyzed for IGF2, IGF1R, INSR, and IGF2R
mRNA expression levels by RT-qPCR. We found the IGF2
expression levels in G401 and BT16 were both upregulated
during starvation, although the IGF2 basal mRNA levels
in G401 and BT16 were lower compared with HEK293T
(Figure 1B). Since IGF2 exhibits homology with insulin,

and IGF2 ligand binding may active both the insulin-like
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and insulin receptor
(INSR) tyrosine kinases [33], we detected the change in
mRNA expression levels of IGF1R and INSR. We found
the basal levels of IGF1R and INSR in G401 were higher
than BT16 and HEK293T (Figure 1B). Similar to IGF2,
the IGF1R and INSR mRNA levels were also upregulated
upon starvation, implying increased sensitivity to ligand
signaling. The increased expression levels of IGF1R and
INSR were also detected by western blot. Consistent with
RT-qPCR results, we found the IGF1R and INSR protein
levels slightly upregulated in starved G401 and BT16
(Figure 1C). The expression levels of IGF1R and INSR
increased in a time-dependent manner from Day 0 to Day 4
(Figure 1D). Unlike IGF1R and INSR, IGF2R inhibits the
IGF2 signaling pathway. IGF2R binds IGF2 and functions
for trafficking excess ligand to lysosomes for degradation
and/or directly mediating IGF2 signaling [34]. We showed
here, the mRNA level of IGF2R was increased in serum
starved G401 and BT16 cell lines, but the protein level
had little changed (Figure 1B and 1C). The absence of
SNF5 in MRT cell lines was also confirmed by western
blot analysis (Figure 1C). Taken together, these results
proved the IGF2 axis was upregulated in MRT cell serumstarvation growth.

and then are down-regulated post-natally. P1 drives a low
level of IGF2 expression in the adult liver [8]. As shown in
Supplementary Figure 1, epirubicin upregulated the IGF2
mRNA level mainly through re-activated the P3 and P4
promoters. Unlike IGF2, mild changes were seen in IGF2
receptors, IGF1R, INSR and IGF2R (Figure 2C). IGF1R
mRNA showed a slight reduction in both cell lines upon
epirubicin and etoposide stimulation. INSR mRNA levels
slightly increased relative to untreated control group in
both cell lines when treated by epirubicin. But mildly
reduced upon etoposide induction. The mRNA expression
of IGF2R showed little decrease or no changed upon
chemotherapy agent treatment. The low IGF2R expression
was closely associated with the chemotherapy response in
NSCLC patients. Patients with low IGF2R expressions had
a poorer prognosis than those with high IGF2R expressions
[34]. We also detected IGF1R, INSR and IGF2R protein
levels by western blot. epirubicin and etoposide stimulation
did not trigger obviously changes or only caused slightly
reductions of IGF1R, INSR or IGF2R in G401 and BT16
(Figure 2D). The epirubicin and etoposide activated
IGF2 axis could further activate downstream pathways.
The phospho-ERK1/2 level increased in G401 cells, but
the phospho-AKT level was not changed. On the contrary,
the phospho-AKT level was increased obviously in BT16,
but the phospho-ERK1/2 level was reduced slightly.
Notably, the protein level of AKT was also increased in
BT16 cells treated by epirubicin and etoposide (Figure 2D).
The upregulation of AKT in BT16 was also confirmed by
RT-qPCR (Supplementary Figure 2). These results support
the idea that IGF2 plays an important role in the resistance
to apoptotic stimulation from microenvironment in vitro.

Epirubicin HCl and etoposide induced IGF2
overexpression, and activated downstream
survival-related pathways
Chemotherapeutic treatment induces oxidative
stress and contributes to drug resistance. There remains
a critical need for effective strategies to overcome
clinical chemotherapeutic agent resistance [16].
Evidence implies IGF2 is involved in the regulation of
chemotherapy resistance and tumorigenicity. According
to previous reports, IGF2 expression increased during
prostate cancer progression in clinical databases [33]. In
addition, following Taxol treatment, IGF2 mRNA levels
progressively increased in ovarian cancer [16]. Considering
our serum-free growth results, we next assessed whether
chemotherapeutic agent exposure also affects the IGF2
axis in MRT. We randomly chose epirubicin HCl and
etoposide which are chemotherapeutics commonly used to
treat MRT. We confirmed the induction of cell death by
epirubicin and etoposide in G401 and BT16 by MTS assay.
Epirubicin and etoposide suppressed cell proliferation in
a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2A). RT-qPCR results
showed IGF2 mRNA levels progressively increased in
both G401 and BT16 cells following chemotherapeutic
treatment for 72 hours (Figure 2B). This was particularly
significant in epirubicin, which increased IGF2 mRNA
expression levels nearly 30-fold compared with untreated
groups. Etoposide triggered a 2.5-fold (G401) and 8-fold
(BT16) increase in IGF2 mRNA levels. In human, IGF2
promoters P2, P3, and P4 are active in many fetal tissues

Autocrine IGF2 supported persistent growth of
MRT cells by activating downstream multiple
kinases signaling
We investigated possible downstream mechanisms
underlying the IGF2-IGF1R/INSR axis in MRT. The
IGF1R and INSR activate phosphoinositide 3 kinase
(PI3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling. These two pathways predominantly mediate cell
survival and stimulate cellular proliferation, respectively
[35]. We observed increased phospho-AKT and phosphoERK1/2 levels upon the stimulation of recombinant human
IGF2 protein at 10 minutes in starved G401 (Figure 3A,
panel 1 and 3, lane 2 and 3). IGF2 induced phosphorylation
of AKT lasted more than 30 minutes (Figure 3A, panel 1,
lanes 2–7). In comparison, phospho-ERK1/2 reduced after
30 minutes exogenous IGF2 signal exposure (Figure 3A,
panel 3, lane 6 and 7). However, levels were higher than
basal in serum-free medium (Figure 3A, panel 3, lane 1).
IGF2 is secreted by most tissues where it acts in
an autocrine or paracrine manner to regulate cell growth,
differentiation and metabolism. To determine the role IGF2
plays in MRT cell proliferation, we added the neutralizing

antibody against IGF2 in conditional α/Ham FBS-containing
or serum-free medium to block the functions of autocrine
IGF2. The results show markedly decreased proliferation
of G401 regardless of serum-containing or serum-free
culture (Figure 3B, top panels). The cell numbers were not
increased, if not reduced, 48 hours after adding neutralizing
anti-IGF2 immunoglobulin in medium containing 10%
FBS (10%FBS-anti-IGF2) or serum-free medium (SFManti-IGF2). Serum-independent proliferation of BT16 was
also impaired by IGF2 blockade, although not as sharp as
G401. However, the growth rate was not changed by the
IGF2 neutralizing antibody in the serum-containing group
(Figure 3B, bottom panels). These results support the idea
that IGF2 plays a significant role in promoting proliferation
and adaptation to poor conditions in MRT.

abrogated IGF2-induced AKT phosphorylation in both
G401 and BT16, as well as ERK1/2 phosphorylation in
BT16. We found no effects on phospho-ERK1/2 levels in
G401 cells (Figure 4B, lane 4–7). Perhaps reduction of
phospho-ERK1/2 needed a longer inhibitor exposure time,
or IGF2 may activate the RAS/ERK pathway by INSR,
which may compensate for the reduced IGF1R to transmit
autocrine IGF2 signals, or other receptors as compensation
when IGF1R was blocked in this cell line.
Interestingly, NVP-AEW541 reduced G401 cell
viability cultured in α/Ham medium containing 10% FBS
in a dose dependent manner (Supplementary Figure 3, red
line). However, when the same assay was performed in
serum-free α/Ham medium, we observed a slow decline of
cell viability in concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 4 µM
of NVP-AEW541 (Supplementary Figure 3, blue line).
The percentage of cell viability in this concentration
region ranged from 50.4% to 49.49% when cells were
cultured in serum-free medium. This variation was more
significant when cells were culture in complete medium,
which was 56.65% to 28.94%. This phenomenon may be
caused by increased IGF2, IGF1R and INSR in starved
G401, but the accurate underlying mechanism requires
further studies.

Blocking IGF1R inhibited IGF2 signaling and
MRT cell growth
In some childhood malignancies, IGF1R is activated
by endocrine, autocrine, or paracrine mechanisms [36].
Biological functions of IGF2 are mainly exerted through
IGF1R. Therefore, to investigate IGF1R as a mediator of
IGF2 survival signaling, and as an potential therapeutic
target in MRT, we determined whether blocking IGF1R
inhibited tumor cell growth in vitro [30]. NVP-AEW541, a
small molecule IGF1R tyrosine kinase inhibitor, was used
to treat G401 and BT16 cell lines. This treatment caused
a significant reduction of cell growth in G401 and BT16.
In both cells, a dose dependent inhibition was clearly seen
3 days after treatment (Figure 4A). To determine whether
IGF2-induced AKT and ERK1/2 phosphorylation are
dependent on IGF1R activation, we evaluated the effect of
a range of concentrations of NVP-AEW541 (0.5–5 µM) to
disrupt IGF2 axis signaling in G401 and BT16 (Figure 4B)
[16]. Cells were cultured in serum-free α/Ham medium for
12 hours, the medium was changed again 2 hours before
rhIGF2 stimulation to avoid IGF2 autocrine accumulation.
NVP-AEW541 was applied 1 hour before addition of
rhIGF2. After stimulation with 200 ng/ml rhIGF2 or 10%
FBS for 15 minutes, total cell lysate was collected, and
western blot was performed to detect the IGF2-mediated
downstream activation [37]. The phosphorylation levels
of AKT and ERK1/2 showed a slight decrease after cells
were starved for 14 hours compared with cells cultured
in complete α/Ham medium (Figure 4B, lanes 1 and 2).
The rhIGF2 activated AKT and ERK1/2 more effectively
compared with 10% FBS in G401 and BT16 (Figure 4B,
lanes 3 and 8). IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 effectively

AKT inhibitor impaired MRT viability in vitro
Previous studies have established the importance
of PI3K/AKT signaling in transformation of many
tumor types [38]. Reports show that AKT signaling
pathway is a central axis in survival and proliferation of
smarcb1-deficient cells [26]. Furthermore, according to
our data, IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 blocks MRT
cell growth accompanied by impaired AKT activity in
G401 and BT16. To further validate the role of AKT
signaling in survival and proliferation of MRT cells, we
assayed the sensitivity of G401 and BT16 to a highly
selective, pan-AKT inhibitor, MK-2206 2HCl. First, we
confirmed this allosteric inhibitor effectively blocked
AKT phosphorylation within 4 hours in vitro by western
blot in G401 and BT16 (Figure 5A). As expected,
inhibition of AKT activity reduced G401 and BT16
proliferation upon inhibitor treatment for 3 days (Figure
5B), indicating a dependence on PI3K/AKT signaling
for MRT cell survival. Similar to NVP-AEW541, when
G401 cells were cultured in serum-free medium, a stable
cell surviving fraction appeared among the concentration
from 2.5 to 10 µM. At this range, the percentage of cell
viability varied from 50.09% to 46.21% (Figure 5B, blue

line). This change was more dramatic in complete α/Ham
medium group, showing a nearly linear decrease from
59.68% to 23.40% (Figure 5B, red line). Unlike G401,
BT16 showed similar cell viability when cultured with or
without serum. Furthermore, we evaluated the activity of
RAS/ERK upon MK-2206 HCl treatment. surprisingly,
the RAS/ERK pathway was activated by MK-2206 HCl,
what is more, the expression levels of phospho-ERK1/2
were even higher in the serum-starved cells than nonstarved cells, special in G401. Combined with the results
shown in Figure 4B, targeting multiple pathways by
means of combination treatment may be a more beneficial
approach to treat MRT.

MRTs are one of the most aggressive pediatric
tumors arising in very early childhood, with a median age
of onset of 11 months. Most children die from the disease
within 1 year of diagnosis despite the use of intensive
therapies [39]. In this study, we provide the first evidence
that environmental stresses, including serum deprivation
and chemotherapeutic agent exposure induce IGF2
upregulation in malignant rhabdoid tumor cell lines. We
evaluated the role of IGF2 signaling pathway in MRT cell
proliferations, and also confirmed this hormone promotes
cancer cell growth through stimulation of IGF1R and INSR,

which is associated with activation of PI3K/AKT and RAS/
ERK pathways. Our findings show treatment targeting
IGF2 axis, including neutralization of IGF2, inhibition
of IGF1R or AKT activity by small molecule inhibitors,
significantly impaired MRT growth in vitro (Figure 6).
Therefore, our results provide preclinical evidence that
IGF2 axis supports the persistent growth of MRT under
microenvironment stress, and make this axis an attractive
research target in respect of novel therapeutic strategy of
MRT in the future.
During cancer progression, as a consequence of rapid
growth, poor vascularization and necrosis, cancer cells
are frequently exposed to physiological stress conditions
such as hypoxia and nutrient limitation [40, 41]. Tumor
cells must adapt to such stresses in order to survive

and proliferate. The tumor microenvironment causes
upregulation of various genes to increase survival potential
and tumor aggressiveness [28]. To mimic the poor nutrient
supply microenvironmental conditions, we cultured MRT
cell lines in serum-free medium, and confirmed the serumindependent growth abilities in two MRT cell lines, G401
and BT16. We found the IGF2 axis was upregulated in
starved MRT cell lines. Reports showed chemotherapeutic
drug treatment or radiation therapy also cause oxidative
stress and contribute to drug resistance [40]. We randomly
chose two widely used clinical anti-MRT chemotherapeutic
agents, epirubicin and etoposide, to treat MRT cells.
According to our results, although the basal level of
IGF2 mRNA in G401 and BT16 were lower compared
with HEK293T, upon treatment of chemotherapeutic

agents, IGF2 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated
in G401 and BT16 as a result of the re-activation of the
fetal promoters P3 and P4. Increases were approximately
30-fold when treated with epirubicin, and 2.5-8 fold when
treated with etoposide. Considering the effect of IGF2
in promoting cell growth, the results of serum withdraw
and chemotherapeutic agent exposure assays indicated
IGF2 plays an essential role in MRT cell survival in
the hostile microenvironment. Chemotherapy induced
IGF2 overexpression was also reported by other groups,
including Domingo-Domenech et al. where IGF2 was
abundantly secreted into the medium of chemotherapyresistant cultures [33]. According to Grasso et al. [42]
and Taylor et al. [43], IGF2 is upregulated during disease
progression. Moreover, following Taxol treatment, IGF2

mRNA levels progressively increased over 24 hours in
findings by Horwitz et al. [16]. IGF2 is overexpressed in a
spectrum of human cancers, and is associated with a poor
prognosis [30]. Elevated serum IGF2 is also associated
with increased risk of developing various cancers including
colorectal, breast, ovarian, testicular, liver, and resistance
to anticancer regimens [44]. Several mechanisms of IGF2
overexpression have been described. For example, loss of
imprinting (LOI) is a well-described mechanism of IGF2
overexpression. But biallelic expression would presumably
only lead to a two-fold increase in mRNA. Moreover, LOI
of IGF2 is not exclusive to cancer cells, it is also commonly
observed in normal neonates and adult humans [7]. Thus,
this may not fully explain why chemotherapy treatment
increases IGF2 expression in our case. In addition, IGF2

Figure 6: Schematic illustration of IGF2 axis, downstream kinase pathways, potential therapeutic targets in MRT
cells. In the SNF5/INI1/SMARCB1/BAF47 deficient MRT cells, IGF2 was upregulated when cells suffer from microenvironmental stress
including serum deprivation and chemotherapeutic agent exposure. The autocrine IGF2 in turn activated intracellular PI3K/AKT and RAS/
ERK pathways through IGF1R and INSR. These two pathways further contribute to survival, proliferation and anti-apoptosis of the tumor
cells. Inhibiting this pathway, including IGF2 neutralizing antibody, IGF1R inhibitor NVP-AEW541 and AKT inhibitor MK-2206 2HCl,
effectively abolished the ability of the tumor cells to grow in vitro.

expression may be deregulated by transcription factors,
including GATA2 [33], E2f3 [8], and ZFP57 [45]. However,
the mechanism of IGF2 upregulation in MRT cells caused
by microenvironment stress is still unknown. Characterized
by the loss of SNF5, a core subunit of the SWI/SNF
complex, multiple oncogenic pathways are upregulated in
MRT. But, further research is needed to determine whether
the increased IGF2 expression upon apoptotic stimulation
is associated with SNF5-deficientcy and the activity of
residual BRG1-containing SWI/SNF complex.
As shown in this paper, IGF2 activates PI3K/AKT
and RAS/ERK pathways in G401 and BT16. These two
pathways are involved in cell proliferation, survival and
anti-apoptosis. Our data reveal IGF2 neutralizing antibody
effectively decreased the serum-independent proliferation
of G401 and BT16. The most significant effect was seen
in G401, which expressed higher IGF2 level and exhibited
stronger proliferation capacity than BT16 in the serum-free
culture. This result indicates the IGF2-dependent serumfree growth of MRT. To date, ligand-targeting approaches,
such as the fully human IGF2 ligand-neutralizing antibody
BI 836845, and IGF2-bispecific antibody m67 are in the
preclinical stage of development [18, 46].
IGF2 may bind to both the IGF1R and INSR tyrosine
kinases. Intratumoral overexpression of IGF2 may indicate
the presence of an autocrine loop, implying addiction to
IGF1R activation and a higher probability of response to
agents that effectively target this receptor [44]. According
to our data, starvation treatment did not reduce mRNA or
protein levels of IGF1R and INSR in G401 and BT16,
and the expression of IGF2R was also hardly changed,
which functions to clear IGF2 from the cell surface to
attenuate signaling. Epirubicin and etoposide treatment
slightly decreased expression of IGF1R and INSR, in the
meantime reduced the IGF2R level. The IGF1R-specific
small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor NVP-AEW541
effectively blocked G401 and BT16 proliferation in
our cases, demonstrating small-molecule inhibitors and
monoclonal antibodies that target the IGF1R may be an
alternative therapeutic strategy for clinical treatment of
MRT [16]. Indeed, anticancer reagents using neutralizing
antibodies to target growth factors and receptors have
emerged as a new class of effective therapeutics for human
cancer [30]. It is worth noting that NVP-AEW541 only
blocked AKT but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation in G401,
indicating the activation of AKT is mainly dependent
on IGF1R in both cell lines. Nevertheless, ERK1/2 may
be activated by other pathways in G401. Because IGF2
targeting antibody inhibits ligand activation of both IGF1R
and IR-A, IGF2 targeting treatment may offer better
outcomes compared with IGF1R targeting or IGF1R/
INSR targeting therapy. The latter may be invalidated
by crosstalk between the INSR and IGF1R pathways, or
cause hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia by suppressing
insulin signal through INSR, respectively [20].

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Based on the previously reports, the PI3K/AKT
pathway is a crucial means of maintaining the survival and
growth of MRT cells, and this pathway is dysregulated
in MRT cells [29]. Accumulating evidence indicates that
the PI3K/AKT pathway also plays an important role in
tumor angiogenesis and decreases the response of tumors
to radiation [27]. In light of our data, drugs inhibiting the
PI3K pathway may be of great value in MRT therapy. The
highly selective inhibitor of pan-AKT, MK-2206 2HCl,
effectively blocked G401 and BT16 growth. Interestingly,
MK-2206 stimulation increased the phospho-ERK1/2
level, special in the absence of serum. A stable cell
surviving fraction appeared when G401 was treated by
gradually increased doses of NVP-AEW541 and MK-2206
in serum-free medium. One possible explanation is that
starved G401 produced more IGF2 and IGF2 receptors.
IGF2 may have enhanced the cells survival capacity
through IGF1R and/or INSR against these two inhibitors
at certain concentration ranges. But the exact mechanism
still needs to be determined by further research.
In summary, our results show that IGF2 axis is
upregulated in the harsh microenvironment, and acts as a
key driver in the proliferation of MRT. These data suggest
IGF2 plays a crucial role in tumor aggressiveness and
chemotherapy resistance. Our results add to the current
knowledge of MRT, and identify IGF2 axis as a promising
target for future researches related to therapeutic
approaches for MRT.

Growth assays
Serum-free growth assays were carried out as
described by Schofield et al. [31]. Briefly, cells were
split into 60 mm dishes at an appropriate density. For
routine assays this was usually 1–4 × 105 per dish,
about 10% confluence. The plating medium was α/
Ham medium containing 10% FBS. After attachment
overnight, dishes were washed twice by PBS, and
finally 4 ml serum-free α/Ham medium supplemented
with 10 μg/ml holo- transferrin human was added.
Cells in three dishes were harvested by trypsin, and
counted in a haemocytometer as a starting number,
noted as Day -1. Twenty four hours later, dishes were
washed by PBS, and medium was changed again with
α/Ham medium containing 10% FBS or 10 μg/ml
transferrin, triplicate dishes was counted and noted as
Day 0. Medium was changed daily, and cell numbers were
counted on each successive day to Day 7 in triplicate (in
the case of HEK293T, cell number were counted to Day
5 given more than 90% cell death on Day 5). For small
molecule inhibitors study, 0.5–1.5 × 105 cells were split
into 24-well dishes. After attachment overnight, dishes
were washed twice by PBS, and medium was changed
again with McCoy’s 5A medium for G401 or RPMI-1640
medium for BT16 supplemented with 10% FBS. Small
molecule inhibitor NVP-AEW541 (Selleckchem) was
added at 0, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 µM. After 72 hours, triplicate
wells for each inhibitor concentration were trypsinized
and counted in a haemocytometer. For IGF2 neutralizing
antibody assay, 2–3 × 104 cells were split into 24-well
dishes. After attachment overnight, dishes were washed
twice by PBS, and medium was changed with serumfree α/Ham medium containing 10 μg/ml transferrin or α/
Ham medium supplemented with 10% FBS. 10 μl IGF2
neutralizing antibody (millipore, 05–166) was added
daily. Triplicate wells were trypsinized and counted in a
haemocytometer after 24 and 48 hours.

0.5–1.5 × 106 cells were cultured in 6-well dishes,
after attachment, dishes were washed twice by PBS. For
IGF2 stimulation assay, cells were applied with serumfree α/Ham medium containing 10 μg/ml holo-transferrin
human for 12 hours. Medium was changed again 2 hours
before IGF2 stimulation to avoid the accumulation of
autocrine IGF2. 100 ng/ml or 200 ng/ml recombinant
human IGF2 (rhIGF2) (Abcam, ab9575) was added to
stimulate cells for 10, 15 or 30 minutes. Medium was
discarded immediately, cells were washed twice by PBS
and harvested by cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
6.8, 8 M urea, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease
inhibitor mixture). To detect the effect of NVP-AEW541
on IGF2 induced activation of downstream signaling
pathway, cells were applied with serum-free α/Ham
medium containing 10 μg/ml transferrin or α/Ham medium
containing 10% FBS for 12 hours. Medium was changed
again 2 hours before rhIGF2 stimulation to avoid the
accumulation of autocrine IGF2. 1 hour before stimulation,
DMSO or 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5 µM NVP-AEW541 was added.
Cells were treated with 10% FBS or 200 ng/ml rhIGF2 for
15 minutes, the medium was discarded immediately, after
cells were washed twice by PBS, they were harvested by
cell lysis buffer. To detect the effect of MK-2206 2HCl
on downstream signaling pathway, after attachment, cells
were incubated with medium supplemented with 1, 2.5,
5 µM MK-2206 2HCL or DMSO for 4, 12, 24 or 48 hours.
The medium was discarded, and cells were washed twice
by PBS followed by harvested by cell lysis buffer.

In vitro apoptotic stimulation on IGF2 axis
To detect the effect of apoptotic-inducing factors on
the activities of IGF2 axis, 0.5–1.5 × 106 cells were seeded
into 6-well dishes, or 1–2 × 106 cells were seeded into
60 mm dishes. After attachment overnight, dishes were
washed twice by PBS. For starvation treatment assay, the
medium was changed with serum-free α/Ham medium
containing 10 μg/ml transferrin or α/Ham medium
supplemented with 10% FBS, then cells were harvested
1–4 days later. For chemotherapy drugs treatment assay,
the medium was changed with McCoy’s 5A for G401 or
RPMI-1640 for BT16 medium supplemented with 10%
FBS, in addition of DMSO (SIGMA), 0.5 µM Epirubicin
HCl (Dalian Meilun Biological Technology), or 5 µM
Etoposide (Dalian Meilun Biological Technology), then
cells were harvested 3 days later.

Western bolt assay was performed as described
previously [47]. Briefly, cells were lysed by sonication for
30 seconds on ice in cell lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH
6.8, 8 M urea, 5% mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, and protease
inhibitor mixture). After addition of 4 × SDS sample
buffer and boiling at 100°C for 7 min, equal amounts of
total protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride
membrane (Immobilon®-PSQ, Millipore). The membranes
were skim milk (BD) blocked at room temperature for 1 hour
or at 4°C overnight then probed with appropriate antibodies
as described in figure legends at room temperature for
3 hours or at 4°C overnight. Primary antibodies used were:
SNF5/INI1/SMARCB1/BAF47 (BETHYL, A301-087A),
AKT (cell signaling technology, #4691), phospho-AKT
(cell signaling technology, #4060), ERK1/2 (cell signaling
technology, #4695), phospho-ERK1/2 (cell signaling
technology, #4377), IGF1R (cell signaling technology,
#3027), INSR (cell signaling technology, #3025), IGF2R
(ImmunoWay, YT5269) and β-actin (Santa Cruz, sc-47778).
After secondary antibody (cell signaling technology, #7074,
#7076) incubation for 1 hour at room temperature, the
targeted proteins were detected using chemilunimescence
(ECL, Vazyme) and exposure of blots to X-ray films.
