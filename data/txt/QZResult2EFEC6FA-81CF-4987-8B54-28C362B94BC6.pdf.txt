BACKGROUND: Currently, no effective alternative treatment exists for progressive, regrowing, nonfunctioning
pituitary adenomas (NFPA) that are resistant to conventional multimodality therapy. Temozolomide (TMZ)
was proposed as a treatment option for pituitary carcinomas and aggressive pituitary adenomas. Recently, it
was suggested that the responsiveness of pituitary tumors to TMZ depends on the immunoexpression of O6methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). Therefore, the authors of this report assessed MGMT expression in a series of patients with progressive, regrowing NFPAs to evaluate whether TMZ may serve as alternative treatment option. METHODS: On the basis of postoperative magnetic resonance imaging, 45 patients
with NFPAs were allocated to either a group with progressive, regrowing tumors (n ¼ 24) or a tumor-free
group (n ¼ 21), which served as a control. MGMT expression was assessed semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry (low expression was defined as 50% immunostained adenoma cells, and high expression was
defined as >50% immunostained adenoma cells) and was compared between the 2 groups. RESULTS: At
the time of initial surgery, low MGMT expression was observed in 12 of 24 patients (50%) in the study group
with progressive, regrowing NFPAs. In the control group of tumor-free patients, only 5 of 21 patients (24%)
exhibited low MGMT expression. A comparable distribution of MGMT expression was observed in the specimens from repeat surgeries. A shorter interval to second surgery was observed in patients who had low
MGMT expression. CONCLUSIONS: The current data has suggested that half of the patients with progressive, regrowing NFPAs exhibit low MGMT expression and are potential candidates for treatment with TMZ.
These findings provide a rationale for the use of TMZ as an alternative treatment approach in this subgroup
if conventional therapy, including reoperation, radiosurgery, and radiotherapy, fails. Cancer 2009;115:1070–

ered the standard treatment of nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA). Because of their frequently
large size at the time of diagnosis and their potentially invasive growth into perisellar structures, incomplete resection is not uncommon1-16 despite
advancing technologies in surgery, such as endoscopy,
neuronavigation, and intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Because regrowth from adenoma remnants is observed frequently (in 38%-95%
of patients who undergo incomplete resection4,6,12,14,17,18), additional treatments, such as reoperation, stereotactic radiosurgery, and fractionated
radiotherapy, may be required. Despite multimodality
treatment, however, NFPAs can progress in rare cases
and pose a significant therapeutic dilemma; because,
currently, there are no pharmacologic treatment
options available. For adenomas that escape standard
therapeutic regimens, the establishment of alternative,
clinically applicable therapeutic options is important.
Temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent,
is part of the routine therapy for glioblastoma multiforme and recently also has been applied successfully
for the treatment of endocrine neoplasms.19 TMZ also
has been proposed for the treatment of prolactin-producing and nonfunctioning, aggressive pituitary adenomas and carcinomas (Table 1).20-27 The few case
studies that have been published reported clinical
improvement, tumor shrinkage, and reduction of hormone secretory activity in most (but not all) patients
who were treated. Consequently, the assessment of
O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT)
expression as a potential marker for adenoma responsiveness to TMZ treatment has been proposed on the
basis of 2 clinical cases: In the first case, an MGMTimmunonegative tumor was identified as responsive to
TMZ; whereas, in the second case, high MGMT
expression was associated with TMZ resistance.23
The objective of the current study was to assess
MGMT immunoexpression in a series of recurrent
NFPAs that required further treatment. Our data may
serve as a basis for considering whether TMZ could serve
as a potential alternative treatment for the rare cases of
NFPAs that are resistant to conventional therapy.

Definition of the Study Cohort
For the current study, the database of the Department of
Neurosurgery of the Medical University Vienna was
screened for NFPAs (Table 2). Patients were selected
according to the following criteria:
1) Absence of clinical and biochemical signs of hormone hypersecretion by the pituitary adenoma
(with the exception of concurrent hyperprolactinemia with prolactin levels <100 lg/L caused by
stalk compression)28,29;
2) Availability of adequate tissue specimens for histologic typing and immunohistochemistry (therefore,
apoplectic pituitary adenomas without vital tumor
areas were excluded);
3) Postoperative radiographic follow-up: Only patients
who had MRI follow-up performed at a minimum
of 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively and at 12-months intervals thereafter were
included. In patients who had large residual tumor
mass, critical location (eg, vicinity of the optic
nerve), or accelerated tumor growth, reassessments
were carried out at shorter time intervals.
On the basis of postoperative MRI, patients were
distributed into the following 2 groups.

Study group (progressive, regrowing tumors)

This group was defined with regard to the possibility
of future treatment with TMZ. Patients were included in
this group if a postoperative tumor remnant was detected
on imaging studies (median time to detection of residual
tumor, 6 months; range, 3-24 months) that changed in
size and configuration over time and necessitated further
interventions, as verified by at least 2 sequential MRI
examinations.

Clinical, endocrinologic, and radiologic data were
retrieved from the hospital archives. In 5 patients, a transcranial approach was used at first surgery. For all other
patients, the transsphenoidal route was used. All tumors
fulfilled the criteria of macroadenomas (>1 cm in greatest
dimension).
Tumor invasiveness was assessed according to surgical reports: Adenomas were considered invasive if intraoperative signs of dural, bone, and/or cavernous sinus
invasion were noted. Preoperative MRI data also were
used to evaluate invasiveness only if the surgical report
was inconclusive.

Control Group

This group included only postoperative patients
who were tumor-free: If a postoperative residual tumor
definitely was excluded by means of MRI, then patients
were categorized as tumor-free. The minimum follow-up
was 5 years (median, 9.3 years).

The hormone expression profile of all pituitary adenomas
was reviewed according to the current World Health
Organization (WHO) classification 200430:

are immunopositive for 1 or more anterior pituitary
hormone(s); also, there is an oncocytic variant,
which is similar to ‘null cell adenoma’ but composed of acidophilic cells that have abundant cytoplasm (oncocytes) in hematoxylin and eosin stain;
Gonadotroph adenoma: tumor tissue that is immunopositive for follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)
and/or luteinizing hormone (LH) (the presence of a
few scattered cells that are positive for FSH or LH
is considered insufficient evidence of hormone
expression);
Plurihormonal adenoma: tumor tissue that is immunopositive for more than 1 anterior pituitary hormone (the presence of a few scattered cells that are
positive for any 1 hormone is considered insufficient evidence for plurihormonality);
Silent corticotroph adenoma: no clinical or biochemical evidence of hormone excess and tumor tissue
that is immunopositive for adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (the presence of a few scattered cells
that are positive for ACTH is considered insufficient evidence of hormone expression); and
Unclassified: all pituitary adenomas that did not
meet the above criteria.

For the evaluation of hormone expression, sections
of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of pituitary adenomas were incubated with primary antibody to
pituitary hormones: antimouse ACTH (1:75 dilution;
DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark), antihuman growth hormone (1:1000 dilution; DAKO), antimouse LH (1:1
dilution; BioGenex, San Ramon, Calif), antimouse thyCancer

antimouse FSH (dilution; 1:200; BioGenex), antihuman
prolactin (1:2000 dilution; DAKO), and antihuman a
subunit of pituitary hormone (1:400 dilution; Immunotech, Marseille, France).
MGMT Immunoexpression and Analysis
Sections were cut at a thickness of 3 lm to 5 lm from routinely formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue
blocks. Slides underwent heat-induced antigen retrieval
for 20 minutes in citrate buffer, pH 6.0, in a steamer. Sections were incubated overnight with a mouse monoclonal
anti-MGMT antibody (clone MT3.1; Neo Markers, Fremont, Calif) at 1:50 dilution. Negative controls were performed by omission of the primary antibody. For a
positive control of the staining reaction, a tumor section
from a glioblastoma with previously verified MGMT
expression was stained in parallel to all cases in our study
cohort.
MGMT immunostaining was evaluated jointly by 3
observers (A.W., G.W., M.P.) on a multiheaded microscope. The amount of anti-MGMT-immunostained
tumor cells was scored semiquantitatively by visual
impression as follows (Fig. 1A-C): 1) none, few endothelial cells immunostained and <10% of tumor cells immunostained; 2) few, 10% to 50% of tumor cells
immunostained; and 3) many, >50% of tumor cells
immunostained.

expression predicts responsiveness to TMZ treatment,23

MGMT-positive tumor cells were subsumed into a low

defined as the group in which >50% of tumor cells were
positive for MGMT.
Statistical Analysis
For statistical analyses, the SPSS software package (version
15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) was used. The chi-square
test was used to compare qualitative variables between
subgroups. Kaplan-Meier plots with log-rank tests were
used to compare the MGMT subgroups with regard to
the percentage of patients who underwent reoperation. A
P value <.05 was considered significant.

RESULTS
MGMT immunoexpression yielded interpretable results
in tumor tissue specimens from all patients.

remaining 28 patients (62%) had high MGMT
expression.

Study Group (Progressive, Regrowing)
Versus Control Group (Tumor-free)
We compared MGMT expression in patients who had
progressive, regrowing tumors (n ¼ 24) with MGMT
expression in tumors from patients who remained tumorfree after the first operation (n ¼ 21): In the group with
progressive, regrowing tumors, low MGMT expression
was observed more frequently compared with the tumorfree group (50% vs 24%). Conversely, high MGMT
expression was more common in the tumor-free group
than in the group with progressive, regrowing tumors
(76% vs 50%). However, these differences did not reach
statistical significance (P ¼ .071).

Total Study Cohort

Repeat Surgeries

MGMT expression was determined in primary surgery
specimens of all patients (n ¼ 45) (Table 3). Low MGMT
expression was observed in 17 patients (38%), and the

MGMT expression was assessed in tissue samples from
repeat surgery in the group with progressive, regrowing
tumors. Four patients had to be excluded for the following

reasons: 1) The poor condition of 1 elderly patient did
not allow for reoperation, and the patient died of aggressive tumor progression; 2) in 2 patients, reoperation currently is scheduled; and 3) in 1 patient, no adequate vital
tumor tissue was available for the assessment of MGMT
expression after an apoplectic event before repeat surgery.
Thus, 20 patients were included in the subsequent
analysis.
We observed that MGMT expression in tissue specimens from repeat surgery was comparable to the level of
MGMT expression in the primary tumor (50% high
MGMT expression, 50% low MGMT expression). However, the proportion of patients who had tumors that displayed ‘no MGMT expression’ (<10% MGMT-positive
tumor cells) increased compared with the proportion of
patients who had tumors with no MGMT expression at
primary surgery (P value nonsignificant.).
To assess changes in MGMT expression within a
regrowing tumor over time, a pairwise analysis of tissue
samples from primary surgery and last surgery was conducted. In the majority of patients (13 patients, 65%),
MGMT expression remained unchanged. However, in 5
patients (25%), changes from high to low MGMT expression and, in 2 patients (10%), changes from low to high
MGMT expression were detected.

MGMT Expression and Time to Reoperation
Finally, the time to second operation with respect to low
versus high MGMT expression in all patients was studied
(Fig. 2). We observed a shorter interval to second surgery
in patients who had low MGMT expression (6.2 years for
patients with low MGMT expression vs 10.7 years for
patients with high MGMT expression; log-rank P ¼
.057).

DISCUSSION
Because of their frequently large size at the time of diagnosis and their frequently invasive growth into perisellar
structures, the complete surgical removal of NFPAs often
is not possible. Regrowth has been reported in 38% to
95% of patients.4,6,12,14,17,18 In these patients, current
standard treatments include: 1) reoperation for patients
with visual deterioration for opticochiasmatic decompression; 2) stereotactic radiosurgery, which is effective in

patients with small adenoma remnants distant to the opticochiasmatic system31-37; and 3) fractionated radiotherapy,
which is reserved for the rare cases that are considered
inoperable because of their fibrous consistency and
unsuitable for radiosurgery because of large tumor size,
location, and extension.14,15,31-33,38-40 Although tumor
control is achieved in up to 93% of patients,40 long-term
side effects of fractionated radiotherapy are common and
include hypopituitarism, cerebrovascular disease,
cognitive impairment, optic neuropathy, and the formation of secondary tumors as well as increased
mortality.15,31,33,38,39,41,42
Unlike prolactinomas, growth hormone-producing
adenomas, and thyrotropin-producing adenomas, to our
knowledge there currently is no routinely applicable pharmacologic therapy available for NFPAs.17,43-46 In addition, for the rare cases of NFPA that remain progressive
despite multimodality treatment, the establishment of
alternative clinically applicable therapeutic options is
desirable.
TMZ, an alkylating agent, rapidly penetrates the
blood-brain barrier after oral administration and generally
is well tolerated. Currently, TMZ is an essential

component of the standard treatment regimen for glioblastoma multiforme, and it has been determined that
TMZ significantly improves the median survival of
patients harboring these tumors.47-53 In endocrine tumor
entities, patients with pheochromocytoma, pancreatic endocrine neoplasms, and carcinoid tumors had biochemical and radiologic improvement after oral treatment with
TMZ.19
The potential advantages of alkylating drugs such as
TMZ are that they are not cell cycle-specific, they can inhibit all stages of tumor cell growth and, thus, they are
suitable for slow-growing tumors.24 Consequently, TMZ
was examined as a potential treatment alternative for
aggressive, prolactin-producing, and nonfunctioning
pituitary carcinomas and adenomas.
In 2004, Fadul et al described 2 patients with progressive pituitary carcinomas despite multimodality treatment who responded to TMZ with persistent clinical
improvement.20 In the same year, Zhu et al treated a prolactin-producing carcinoma with TMZ, resulting in clinical improvement, tumor shrinkage, and a decrease in
prolactin levels.27 Two later case studies confirmed the
responsiveness of pituitary carcinomas to TMZ.21,24
After the initial success in carcinomas, TMZ treatment consequently was expanded to patients with
aggressive pituitary adenomas. In 2006, Kovacs et al and
Syro et al treated a patient who had a large, invasive, prolactin-producing pituitary neoplasm with TMZ after several unsuccessful surgical procedures.22,23,26 Although
clinical improvement and near normalization of prolactin
levels was observed, MRI studies revealed intratumoral
hemorrhage, necrosis, and tumor shrinkage. After treatment with TMZ, the residual tumor was easily resectable
because of its now friable and soft consistency. Neuropathologic examination confirmed necrosis and hemorrhage
and revealed fibrosis and neuronal transformation.
Finally, mitotic activity and the Ki-67 labeling index
decreased after TMZ treatment. Neff et al reported
another patient with an invasive prolactinoma that was resistant to dopamine agonists and was treated successfully
with TMZ.25 Taken together, these results indicate that
TMZ has a positive effect on tumor shrinkage and hormone activity in prolactin-producing and nonfunctioning
pituitary adenomas and carcinomas that are unresponsive
to standard treatment after a median treatment duration
of 11 months (range, 7-26 months).
1076

The cytotoxic effect of TMZ is caused mainly by
methylation of the O6 position of guanine in DNA. The
DNA repair enzyme MGMT plays a crucial role in the removal of alkylating lesions induced by TMZ. Therefore,
it is believed that high expression of MGMT induces resistance to TMZ. Epigenetic silencing of the MGMT
gene by methylation of the MGMT promoter (with subsequent low MGMT expression) turned out to be the
strongest predictive marker of a favorable outcome in
patients with glioblastomas treated with TMZ.53-56
On the basis of observations in 2 clinical cases,
Kovacs et al recently hypothesized that MGMT immunoexpression also may predict the responsiveness of pituitary tumors to treatment with TMZ.23 In their study they
observed that, in 1 patient, a prolactinoma that was responsive to TMZ was immunonegative for MGMT;
whereas, in the other patient, who had a tumor resistant to
TMZ (a silent subtype II corticotroph adenoma), high
MGMT expression was detected. In light of these findings, we designed the current study to assess MGMT
immunoexpression in a series of patients who possibly
were suitable candidates for TMZ treatment, ie, patients
who had progressive, regrowing NFPAs after surgical
treatment.
For routine clinical purposes, MGMT immunohistochemistry has the advantages of being available in most
laboratories, easier, and more quickly accessible, and less
expensive than methylation-specific polymerase chain
reaction (MSP). In high-grade gliomas, the clinical usefulness of immunohistochemistry for the assessment of
MGMT expression as an alternative to MSP has been
controversially discussed.57-59 In gliomas, non-neoplastic
cell elements entrapped within the diffusely infiltrating
tumor tissue (eg, reactive astrocytes, microglial cells)
impede the reliability of immunohistochemical analysis of
MGMT expression. Conversely, pituitary adenomas have
homogenous tumor cell cytology and lack significant
non-neoplastic cell populations in the tumor tissue, providing favorable features for the reliable assessment of
MGMT expression. Indeed, in most cases in our present
series, MGMT expression could be assigned clearly to the
3-tiered system of none/few/many immunostained tumor
cells, suggesting that the assessment of MGMT expression
by immunohistochemistry can be considered a reliable
technique for evaluating pituitary adenomas. Although
a previous study detected MGMT gene promoter

MGMT Expression in Progressive NFPAs/Widhalm et al

methylation in 23% of pituitary adenomas, we observed
low MGMT protein expression in 38% of cases.60 Further studies are needed to assess the correlation of
MGMT promoter methylation status with MGMT protein expression in pituitary adenomas.
We observed low MGMT expression more frequently in the group with progressive, regrowing NFPAs
compared with the tumor-free control group (50% vs
24%, respectively; P ¼ .071). It is noteworthy that samples from repeat surgery had comparable low MGMT
expression in 50% of patients. Thus, based on results
from other tumor entities and on case reports of pituitary
tumors treated with TMZ, half of patients who have progressive, regrowing NFPAs are potential candidates for
TMZ treatment even after they undergo multiple surgical
procedures.
It has been observed that loss of MGMT expression
occurs during tumorigenesis and results in impaired
capability of DNA repair.61-65 In contrast, it has been
demonstrated that MGMT overexpression prevents carcinogenesis in several mouse models.61 Previous studies
reported a significant decrease in MGMT expression as
astrocytomas progressed from WHO grade 2 to glioblastoma.66,67 Accordingly, negative MGMT expression was
considered a reliable marker for malignant transformation
of low-grade astrocytomas.68 In pituitary adenomas, promoter methylation69-72 with subsequent MGMT inactivation60 is a frequent event and is believed to play a key
role in adenoma development and progression.
In this sense, the higher proportion of patients who
had tumors that lacked MGMT expression (<10%
MGMT-immunostained cells) in tumor specimens from
the last surgery could be interpreted as a change of biologic behavior into a more dedifferentiated adenoma. Furthermore, a reduction in MGMT expression between the
first and last surgeries was reported in 25% of patients in
our study and may reflect a step in adenoma progression.
Two patients, however, displayed an increase in MGMT
expression, and 1 of those was the only patient in our current series who was assessed after radiotherapy. Therefore,
the assessment of MGMT expression status from a tissue
sample of the current tumor maybe of interest in the
future before initiating TMZ treatment.
In untreated, low-grade astrocytomas, another study
demonstrated a shorter progression-free survival in
patients who had methylated MGMT promoter (with
Cancer

March 1, 2009

subsequent reduction of MGMT expression) compared
with patients who had unmethylated MGMT promoter.73,74 Likewise, a negative trend in survival was
reported recently for patients who had untreated glioblastomas with methylated MGMT promoter.75
Similarly, we observed a shorter time to reoperation
in our NFPA patients who had low MGMT expression
(6.2 years vs 10.7 years; log-rank P ¼ .057) using survival
analysis. Furthermore, we observed a higher proportion of
adenomas that had low MGMT expression in the group
with progressive, regrowing tumors. Because MGMT
expression was not correlated significantly with the routinely used prognostic marker MIB-1 labeling index76 in
our series, low MGMT expression may serve as an additional, independent prognostic factor before more aggressive therapy is initiated.
In conclusion, TMZ has been proposed as a possible
alternative in the rare cases of progressive and regrowing
NFPAs that are refractory to standard treatment regimens.
According to our results, a positive response to TMZ may
be expected in 50% of patients because of low MGMT
immunoexpression. Because MGMT expression can
change with regrowth and after radiotherapy, the reassessment of recurrent tumors may be of interest before initiating treatment with TMZ. However, further clinical
studies are needed to clarify the relation between MGMT
expression and responsiveness to TMZ in aggressive
NFPAs.
The assessment of MGMT expression in NFPAs
may serve as an additional prognostic factor with
respect to tumor dedifferentiation and progression.
MGMT expression, therefore, may influence decisions
regarding the postoperative management of individual
patients, such as the frequency of radiographic surveillance and the consideration of further therapeutic
interventions.
