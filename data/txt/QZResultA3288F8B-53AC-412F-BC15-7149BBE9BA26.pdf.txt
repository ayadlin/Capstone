BACKGROUND: The American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality Oncology Practice Initiative endorses in their core measures that
providers should discuss the goals of care (GOC) at the time of chemotherapy consent. GOC refers to chemotherapy treatment
intent: cure versus noncure. In this study, the authors sought to determine whether attributes of patients and initial patient-physician
encounters were associated with patients’ understanding of their GOC. METHODS: In total, the authors surveyed 125 consecutive,
newly diagnosed patients who were receiving chemotherapy for solid malignancies at a single academic cancer center and performed
a medical record review for additional data. Patient understanding of their oncologist’s GOC and oncologist’s reported GOC were
compared. The primary outcome was concordance of patient-physician dyads regarding the GOC (cure vs noncure). RESULTS: One
hundred twenty-five of 137 of eligible patients (91%) completed the survey. Only 95 of 125 patient-physician pairs (75%) patient-physician pairs were concordant regarding the GOC. In a multivariable logistic regression, both older patients (odds ratio, 0.21; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.57) and non-native English speakers had an almost 80% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval,
0.05-0.93) of GOC concordance compared with younger patients and native English speakers. Patients who received printed chemotherapy information during the patient-physician consent process had almost 3 times greater odds (odds ratio, 2.88; 95% confidence
interval, 1.24-6.68) of GOC concordance with their physician compared with those who did not receive materials. CONCLUSIONS:
Patient misunderstanding of GOC was substantial, with 25% of cancer patients misunderstanding the goal of their chemotherapy
treatment. Key predictors of GOC misunderstanding included factors that potentially were amenable to interventions at the time of

INTRODUCTION
A consent form, signed and dated by both the patient and their treating physician, that details the chemotherapy drugs
and their potential toxicities is a requirement at most medical centers. This form is intended to document the conversation
between patient and oncologist and to demonstrate that the patient was informed of their treatment options, the expected
risks, and the potential benefits of the treatment they are agreeing to receive. Prior research suggests that patients and
physicians may differ in their understanding of the intent of chemotherapy or goals of care (GOC).1-3 Misperceptions of
prognosis or GOC are important to recognize, because they may lead to requests for ineffective or futile medical care.4-6
An accurate understanding of GOC may lead to patients making more informed treatment decisions that are aligned with
their overall goals and avoid costly treatments at the end of life.7-10
Inherent in the GOC discussion before chemotherapy is a discussion of the cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options. Discussing prognosis with patients can be a difficult undertaking, and there are several reasons why physicians may not discuss prognosis. Physicians may fear that they will increase patient distress or cause a patient to lose
hope.11 Alternatively, if a discussion regarding prognosis occurs, then there is also the possibility that the physician discloses overly optimistic information.4,12-15 Prior research indicates that approximately 33% of patients who receive treatment
for incurable cancer overestimate their prognoses compared with their physicians.4,7,16
We examined cancer patient-physician dyads to measure concordance in understanding the GOC of chemotherapy.
We dichotomized GOC into 2 categories—curative and non-curative—and focused on patients’ understanding of the
GOC at initiation of chemotherapy to determine whether patient attributes and components of the initial patient-physician encounters were associated with subsequent patient-physician GOC concordance.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
We sampled all consecutive, newly diagnosed patients
who received their first course of intravenous chemotherapy for a solid malignancy at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) between December 17, 2008 and February
23, 2009. Patients were screened for eligibility using the
new patient appointment lists in the Massachusetts General Hospital chemotherapy infusion suite. All stages of
disease (stages I-IV) were eligible for participation.
Patients were required to be able to read and speak English. Patients also were required to have participated in the
consent discussion for chemotherapy within the previous
30 days, and patients could not be enrolled on a clinical
trial.
Eligible patients were approached by a member of
the research staff during their chemotherapy appointment
and were invited to participate in the study. The patients
provided verbal consent for the study, which included
completion of the survey and a review of their medical
records. Consenting patients were provided the survey to
complete during their chemotherapy infusion. Data collected from the medical record included age, sex, disease
site, stage, histology, reason(s) for ineligibility, provider
name, and the provider’s GOC. This study was approved
by the institutional review board at Dana-Farber/Harvard
Cancer Center.
Survey Instrument

The 24-item survey (Appendix A) was designed to assess
patient understanding of the goal of their chemotherapy
treatment and to measure several areas that are relevant to
this understanding. The domains of interest addressed by
the patient survey included: 1) social support, 2) diagnosis, 3) prognosis, 4) treatment goals, 5) information
preferences, 6) psychological distress, and 7) chemotherapy consent. Items addressing these domains were
included from previously validated surveys.11,17-20 The
survey also asked patients to describe their demographics
and functional status, and the survey included questions
addressing the details of the patients’ consent conversations with their treating physicians. The survey consisted
of primarily close-ended questions with multiple response
options. Most questions included the option other
through which patients could express responses that were
not among those listed. The survey was piloted on a
sample of 10 patients.
Outcome Variables

The key outcome variable in the analyses was patient-physician concordance regarding the oncologist’s treatment
intent (curative vs non-curative). To determine patients’
692

understanding of their oncologists’ goals of chemotherapy
treatment, the survey included the following question:
‘‘What did your oncologist explain the purpose of your
chemotherapy to be? (please check all that apply).’’
Response options were as follows: 1) decrease the chance
the disease will return, also called adjuvant treatment; 2)
provide a prolonged time without any evidence of disease,
also called cure; 3) control the growth of the cancer without getting rid of it completely to prolong life; and 4)
reduce side effects and symptoms of the cancer to promote
your comfort, also called palliation. We coded positive
responses to options 1 and/or 2 as curative and coded
positive responses to options 3 and/or 4 as non-curative. If
the respondent checked the last option in combination
with either the first or the second response options, then
the response was categorized as curative. If the respondent
checked the third option with either the first or the second
response options, then the response was categorized as
confused, because the patient indicated that the goal of
chemotherapy treatment was both cure and non-cure.
To determine the physicians’ goals of chemotherapy
treatment for each patient in the study, we reviewed the
Massachusetts General Hospital chemotherapy order
entry system. The chemotherapy order entry, as part of
the process of writing orders for chemotherapy, requires
physicians to answer several questions regarding the
patient (eg, patient height and weight, tumor site, treatment regimen) before they can write chemotherapy
orders. One such question asks physician to indicate
whether the chemotherapy regimen is being administered
for either adjuvant/neoadjuvant/curative intent or palliative/metastatic intent. In this analysis, palliative/metastatic
intent was coded as non-curative. If a patient and their
physician indicated the same GOC, then we termed this
result concordant. If a patient and their physician indicated
a different GOC, then we termed this result non-concordant. Within the non-concordant category, the results
were subdivided into patients who were more optimistic
than the physician (ie, the patient indicated curative intent,
and the physician indicated non-curative intent) and
patients who were less optimistic than the physician (ie, the
patient indicated non-curative intent, and the physician
indicated curative intent).
Predictor Variables

Hypotheses drove the selection of the majority of predictor variables we studied and were defined a priori. Predictor variables included distress level (from the National
Comprehension Cancer Network Distress Thermometer
on the patient survey20), English as a second language,

provision of printed information on chemotherapy (measured by the patient reporting whether or not they received
printed handouts explaining the role and intent of their
chemotherapy drugs), and whether the patient was alone
at the time of the consent discussion. In addition, given
the possibility that 1) physician communication style may
vary according to their cancer subspecialty (eg, breast cancer specialists may communicate GOC differently than
lung cancer specialists) and 2) each physician was a member of only 1 subspecialty group, patient tumor site (as a
measure of physician specialty) also was considered
among the possible predictor variables. Standard demographic variables (ie, age, sex, race, education level) also
were included among predictor variables as well as tumor
stage.
Statistical Analysis

We determined measures of central tendency for all covariates and for the outcome variable. In bivariate analyses,
we compared the cohorts’ covariates with the outcome
variable to determine associations. Associations between
categoric variables were determined using chi-square tests,
and associations between categoric and continuous variables were determined using t tests. Multivariable logistic
regression described associations between predictor variables and the outcome variable. We estimated variance
using the robust method (also known as the Huber/
White/sandwich method)21,22 for clustered-correlated
data; because, with this method, multiple patients can be
nested or clustered within a smaller number of providers.23 All analyses were done using the STATA statistical software package (version 11.2; Stata Corporation,
College Station, Tex).

This table lists the characteristics of surveyed patients in the analytic sample who were receiving their first course of chemotherapy.

RESULTS
In total, 268 consecutive patients were screened for the
study; of these, 137 patients were eligible, and 125 consented to participate (response rate, 91%) (Fig. 1). The
predominant reasons for patient ineligibility included
non-chemotherapy treatment (eg, blood transfusion;
N ¼ 36), enrollment on a clinical trial (N ¼ 20), and
treatment with second-line (or higher) therapies
(N ¼ 17). Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics of all
participants. The mean patient age was 62 years, and 38%
were aged 65 years, 42% were men, 58% were women,
9% were nonwhite, and 12% indicated that English was
their second language (however, they were able to read
and write in English without an interpreter and, thus,
were eligible for the study). In addition, 68% of patients
reported at least a college education, and the mean distress
score (on a scale from 0 to 10) for the sample on the day
of survey was 4.31.

Results from an analysis of bivariate associations of concordance
between patient and physician understandings of the goals of care are
listed according to patient attributes.
b
P values were calculated using the chi-square test unless otherwise
noted.
c
This P value was calculated using a t test.

Of the patient-physician dyads, 76% (95 of 125)
were concordant, and 24% (30 of 125) were discordant
regarding GOC. The kappa coefficient was 0.44, indicating moderate agreement between patients and their physicians on this matter.24 Of the patient-physician dyads that
were concordant (n ¼ 95), the goal of treatment was curative 99% (94 of 95) of the time and non-curative 1% (1 of
95) of the time. Of the patient-physician dyads that were
discordant (n ¼ 30), 20 of 30 patients (66%) reported
that their physician was treating them with curative
intent, but their physicians reported that the intent was
non-curative. In the remaining patients, 10 of 30 patients
(33%) reported that their physician was treating them
with non-curative intent, but their physicians reported
that the intent was curative.
Bivariate analysis (Table 2) demonstrated a strong
association between GOC concordance and patient age.
Concordant patients tended to be younger than non-concordant patients (mean age, 60 years vs 66 years; P ¼ .02).
In addition, 6 of 15 participants (40%) who spoke English as a second language were discordant regarding GOC,
which was approximately twice the rate (24 of 110 participants; 22%) among of native English speakers (P ¼ .12).

Results are listed from a multivariable logistic regression model estimating
the odds of association between patient factors and concordance between
patients and physicians regarding the goals of chemotherapy treatment.

The concordant and non-concordant groups did not vary
with respect to sex, race, education, or distress level; nor
did they vary with respect to patients’ cancer site or disease
stage (results not shown).
In the multivariable logistic regression model
(Table 3), 3 predictors of concordance emerged as both
clinically and statistically significant. Patients aged 65
years had almost 80% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.21;
P ¼ .01) of concordance compared with patients aged <65
years. Patients who spoke English as a second language had
an almost 80% lower odds (odds ratio, 0.23; P ¼ .04) of
concordance compared with patients who were native
English speakers. Finally, the patients who reported receiving printed chemotherapy education materials at the time
of chemotherapy consent had almost 3 times the odds
(odds ratio, 2.88; P ¼ .01) of concordance compared with
those who did not report receiving the materials.
DISCUSSION
The current investigation demonstrates that the concordance of patient-physician dyads regarding GOC was the
Cancer

same in only 76% of cases and that 30 of 125 patients
(24%) did not appear to understand what the chemotherapy they were receiving was intended to do for their illness. Of these patients, most believed that their physician
was treating them for cure, whereas their physicians’ stated
intent was not curative. This finding resonates with previously published reports of discordance of physician-patient
dyads on the matter of prognosis among cancer patients,
in whom it has been demonstrated that 33% of patients
with advanced cancer hold more optimistic survival
expectations (ie, prognoses) than their physicians.2,7,12
The current work extends the existing literature on
cancer patients’ understanding of their illness by identifying yet another index of patient cancer care (ie, treatment
goals) in which there appears to be patient misunderstanding (generally optimistic) regarding their illness. We
observed that approximately 25% of patients did not
appear to understand the goals of the potentially toxic
chemotherapy they were receiving. Patient and physician
clarity at the time of treatment decision-making regarding
GOC is of critical importance given that misunderstandings like these have the potential to lead to future requests
for more intense, but often futile, chemotherapy.4-6
Although some of the non-concordance regarding
GOC in the incurable population may be attributed to
unrealistic optimism,24 the quality of the pretreatment
patient-physician discussions likely also have an impact
on this measure. At least 2 of our findings suggest that
physician-patient communication may explain some of
the discrepancy in GOC understanding between patients
and physicians. That is: 1) non-native English speakers
were less likely than native English speakers to share their
physicians’ understanding of their chemotherapy treatment intent, and 2) those patients who received printed
material were more likely to understand their physicians’
treatment intent. These findings point to potentially amenable aspects of the patient-physician encounter that may
lead to a better understanding of GOC, including communication aids targeted at elderly and non-native English-speaking patients and the provision of printed
information material at the time of the chemotherapy
consent process.
A signed patient consent for chemotherapy is an
American Society of Clinical Oncology Quality Oncology
Practice Initiative measure25 and is intended to be a proxy
for an open, honest, and informative conversation between
provider and patient that includes all information (including GOC) needed for a patient to understand relevant
treatment possibilities and their potential outcomes.26,27
Misunderstanding the GOC (eg, curative vs non-curative)
Cancer

February 1, 2013

may lead patients to make treatment decisions they
otherwise would not have made.28 The 20 of 125 patients
in our study who erroneously believed that the chemotherapy they were receiving was intended to cure them may
have made treatment decisions without the full understanding that a cure was not possible. In addition, there
was a small subset of patients whose physicians’ treatment
intent was curative, but the patients believed that their
disease was not curable. This type of patient misunderstanding is no less concerning. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of pessimistic misunderstanding by patients
who are being treated with curative intent.
Of the patient characteristics, patient age predicted
non-concordance regarding GOC. This finding is noteworthy in light of other research indicating that providers
are more likely to have a frank discussion regarding prognosis with older patients.12 Our finding that non-native
English speakers experienced greater discordance in
understanding GOC compared with native English
speakers, to our knowledge, has not been documented
previously. Finally, our finding that those patients who
received printed material were more likely to understand
their physicians’ treatment intent is also a novel finding.
The latter findings suggest that communication between
providers and patients is at least a component of the problem. Perhaps longer treatment-planning visits with the
inclusion of available friends or family would improve
patients’ understanding of their disease, its prognosis, and
the range of treatment options. Similarly providing communication aids, such as specialized interpreters, may
improve understanding of GOC for those with limited
English proficiency.29-33
The findings may be consistent with low health literacy as a mediating factor. That is, older cancer patients
have among the lowest health literacy rates and face complex oncology management options that must balance
comorbidities and end-of-life preferences. They may also
suffer cognitive and sensory deficits that complicate effective communication. Non-native English speakers also
face important barriers to health literacy not only with
language proficiency but also with cultural differences
that present communication challenges in the health care
setting.34-36 Suboptimal health literacy is an independent
risk factor for poor health outcomes, including diminished cancer screening, advanced stage at diagnosis,
increased risk of hospitalization, decreased acceptance of
and/or compliance with treatment, and decreased participation in clinical trials.37,38
The current study does have are some potential limitations. First, the study was conducted at a single
695

Original Article

institution with few minority patients. Despite this, we
had a substantial percentage of study participants for
whom English was their second language. Second, we
used an original questionnaire to assess communication of
GOC information and evaluated patient understanding
of GOC with a single question. It is possible that the
apparent association between patient receipt of printed
material and concordance was confounded by patient literacy. In addition, there was no detailed evaluation or
direct observation of what the consent or prognostic discussion between provider and patient entailed. However,
the findings suggest that examination of GOC understanding in a larger cohort of patients and examination of
potential differences in subsequent health care use according to patient-physician convergence versus nonconvergence regarding GOC are important future steps.
In summary, we demonstrated that only 76% of
patients reported GOC that were concordant with the
treating oncologist. A 24% rate of cancer patients’ misunderstanding about their disease trajectory is consistent
with prior research, and most patients deviate toward an
optimistic misunderstanding of their prognosis. Our
research advances the literature on cancer patients’ apparent misunderstanding of the goals of chemotherapy treatment by identifying 2 patient characteristics, age 65
years and non-native English speakers; and these characteristics are associated with a high risk for misunderstanding the goals of chemotherapy treatment. Given that low
health literacy may mediate the observed misunderstanding for such patients, longer treatment-planning visits in
conjunction with additional communication aids beyond
printed materials may be useful to elderly patients and
non-native English speaking patients and their physicians
when they discuss GOC.
