ABSTRACT
The TAM family of proto-oncogenic receptor protein tyrosine kinases, comprising
of TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK, is implicated in many human cancers. Their activation
leads to cancer cell proliferation, enhanced migration, invasion, and drug resistance;
however how TAMs are activated in cancers is less understood. We previously showed
that Protein S (PROS1) is a ligand of the TAM receptors. Here we identify PROS1 as
a mediator of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) in proliferation, cell survival
and migration. We demonstrate that excess PROS1 induces OSCC proliferation
and migration. Conversely, blocking endogenous PROS1 expression using shRNA
significantly inhibits cell proliferation and migration in culture. This inhibition was
rescued by the addition of purified PROS1. Moreover, PROS1 knockdown reduced
anchorage-independent growth in-vitro, reduced tumor xenograft growth in nude
mice and altered their differentiation profile. Mechanistically, we identify the
downregulation of AXL transcripts and protein following PROS1 knockdown. Reintroducing PROS1 rescues AXL expression both at the protein and transcriptional
levels. The anti-proliferative effect of the AXL inhibitor R428 was significantly reduced
following PROS1 inhibition, indicating the functional significance of PROS1-mediated
regulation of AXL in OSCC. Taken together, we identify PROS1 as a driver of OSCC
tumor growth and a modulator of AXL expression. Our results point to PROS1 as a
potential novel anti-cancer therapeutic target.

Signaling through AXL activates several
intracellular pathways, leading to increased proliferation,
enhanced migration, invasion and cell survival. Recent
work identifies AXL overexpression to underlie the
induction of alternative survival pathways leading to
therapeutic resistance [3, 6–8]. The role of the TAM
cognate ligands GAS6 and Protein S (PROS1) was
demonstrated in homeostatic regulation of the immune,
reproductive, vascular and nervous systems [9–16]. In
cancer settings, the activation of TAM receptors by GAS6
was shown in several tumor models [17–21], however
the role of PROS1 in oncogenic signaling and tumor
biology has not been extensively investigated. We recently
identified PROS1 as a TAM ligand in the mouse retina
[11], which prompted us to investigate the role of PROS1
in TAM-mediated tumorigenesis.

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck cancer (HNSCC) is the sixth most
common cancer worldwide; however the molecular
mechanisms underlying HNSCC tumorigenesis are not
well understood, impeding on its early detection and
identification of candidate molecules for targeted therapy.
The overexpression and hyperactivation of members of
the TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases – comprising
TYRO3, AXL and MERTK is documented in many
cancers [1]. Recently, the functional significance for
overexpression of AXL and MERTK was reported for
HNSCC, [2, 3]. More specifically, AXL was identified
as a potential therapeutic target in oral squamous cell
carcinoma (OSCC) [4], Head and Neck squamous cell
carcinoma (HNSCC) [5] and esophageal cancer [6], with
poor prognosis correlated to high AXL expression.

PROS1 inhibition in OSCC cell lines attenuates
cell proliferation

Here, we show for the first time that PROS1 is
highly expressed in OSCC cell lines SCC1 and SCC25,
and provide evidence that PROS1 supports cancer
cell proliferation and migration. Inhibition of PROS1
expression suppressed tumor cell proliferation, migration
and anchorage-independent growth in-vitro. Reciprocally,
cell proliferation was stimulated in the presence of PROS1.
In-vivo, PROS1 inhibition decreased tumor growth
and decreased tumor cell differentiation in a xenograft
model. Finally, we identify PROS1 as a potent regulator
of AXL expression, affecting AXL-mediated cell growth
and migration. AXL transcripts and protein levels were
down-regulated following PROS1 knockdown, and both
were recovered upon incubation with PROS1. In keeping
with PROS1-regulated AXL expression, sensitivity to the
small molecule AXL inhibitor R428 was lost following
PROS1 knockdown. Taken together, these results identify
a novel role for PROS1 in OSCC, and advocate PROS1 as
a potential therapeutic target in this disease.

To evaluate the functional significance of PROS1
expression in these OSCC cell lines we introduced stable
shRNA constructs targeting PROS1 mRNA into SCC-1
and SCC-25 cell lines following lentiviral infections. Five
shPROS1 sequences were initially tested for their ability to
inhibit PROS1 expression. Four of these reduced PROS1
transcript and protein levels with strongest inhibition by
more than 85% as observed by RT-qPCR and western blot,
respectively. Two stable puromycin-resistant knockdown
lines shPS1 and shPS2, and two control lines using a
non-relevant (shGFP) or empty targeting vector (shEV)
were generated for both parental SCC-1 and SCC-25 cell
lines (Figure 1E–1F). Fresh knockdown infections were
made periodically to avoid clonal effects. Compared to
the parental and control-treated cells, PROS1 protein was
significantly reduced in the cell lysates of knockdown
lines (Figure 1G). Consistent with PROS1 being a secreted
protein, we detected PROS1 by immunoprecipitation from
the conditioned medium of control, but not of PROS1targeted lines (Figure 1H).
To determine whether PROS1 contributes to OSCC
oncogenic phenotypes, we first studied the effects of
PROS1 inhibition on cell growth and proliferation. Cell
proliferation was evaluated using the XTT and crystal
violet methods. Knockdown of PROS1 in both OSCC
cell lines decreased their proliferation rate in culture,
compared with control-treated cells. Decreased cell
viability was observed for both sh1 and sh2 knockdown
constructs in SCC-1 and SCC-25 cells (Figure 2A, 2B).
Similarly, measuring cell growth by crystal violet also
revealed reduced cell numbers 24 and 48 hours after
plating in sh1 and sh2 PROS1-kd lines, compared to
control-treated cells (Figure 2C, 2D). To directly assess
whether proliferation rates are affected following PROS1
ablation we monitored and compared the percent cells that
have incorporated BrdU (mitotic index) as a function of
PROS1 expression. PROS1 inhibition using both sh1 and
sh2 constructs reduced the mitotic index of SCC-1 cells
by 26% (P = 0.04) and by 33% (P = 0.01), respectively.
Similarly, PROS1 knockdown in SCC-25 cells reduced the
proliferative index by 43% (P = 0.003) and by 53% (P <
0.0001), indicating an inhibitory effect on the proliferation
(Figure 2E, 2F). Similar results were obtained following
transient PROS1 inhibition using the siRNA method. SCC25 cells were transfected with a pool of four OnTarget
siRNAs, resulting in 83% inhibition of PROS1 transcripts
(P<0.0001). PROS1 protein levels were also inhibited
(Supplementary Figure 2A, 2B). As for sh-treated cell
lines, we found that si-mediated targeting of PROS1
reduced cell growth by 31% (P=0.007) and inhibited BrdU
incorporation rates by 42% (P=0.01) (Supplementary
Figure 2C, 2D). Fewer cycling cells were also measured
by Ki-67 immunoreactivity in cultured SCC-25 shPS1

RESULTS
PROS1 is highly expressed in oral squamous cell
carcinoma cell lines
To assess whether PROS1 may have a putative
role in OSCC, we first evaluated PROS1 expression by
different OSCC cell lines. We found highest levels of
PROS1 mRNA transcripts in SCC-1, SCC-25 and JSQ-3
cell lines, followed by CAL-27. PROS1 transcripts were
barely detectable in HaCaT cells, an immortalized human
Keratinocyte cell line (Figure 1A). SCC-1 and SCC-25
cells also expressed high PROS1 protein levels (Figure
1B). Moreover, analysis of the Oncomine public database
(www.oncomine.org) revealed the O’Donnell Oral
database [22], which showed significant overexpression of
PROS1 mRNA in cell lines from OSCC, especially from
the tongue, sharing the same origin as SCC-1 and SCC25 (Supplementary Figure 1). These results suggest that
PROS1 may be a marker for OSCC and may play a role in
the development of this cancer, particularly in the tongue.
We therefore focused on SCC-1 and SCC-25 cell lines.
Since PROS1 was recently shown to function as a
TAM agonist in-vivo [10, 11, 15] and AXL and MERTK
hyperactivation to drive OSCC cell growth and migration
[2, 4], we asked whether the overexpression of PROS1
in SCC-1 and SCC-25 may be functionally relevant in
OSCC. To address this, we stimulated OSSC cells with
exogenous PROS1, and measured cell growth. Culturing
SCC-1 cells in the presence of 28 nmol/L PROS1 for
48 hours stimulated cell growth by 67% (P=0.0006)
compared to non-stimulated cells (Figure 1C). Similar to
SCC-1, addition of PROS1 (56 nmol/L) to SCC-25 cells
stimulated their growth by 56% (P=0.02) (Figure 1D),
indicating that PROS1 promotes proliferation of OSCC
cells.

PROS1 knockdown mitigates OSCC anchorageindependent growth

and shPS2 cells, compared to control-treated cells (30%;
P=0.018 and 45% inhibition; P=0.0059, respectively)
presented in Figure 2G.
To test the direct dependence of SCC-1 and SCC25 cell proliferation on PROS1, we hypothesized that
addition of PROS1 to the growth medium should rescue
the inhibited cell growth observed in sh-treated lines.
Indeed, addition of PROS1 to the growth medium
reversed the growth-arrest observed in both SCC-1 and
SCC-25 PROS1-kd lines. Supplementation of PROS1
increased proliferation rates of SCC-1-shPS1 and
shPS2 lines by 54% (P = 0.004) and 50% (P = 0.001),
respectively (Figure 2H). Similarly, proliferation of
SCC-25 sh1 and sh2 lines had increased by 55% (P =
0.02) and by over 100% (P = 0.001) following addition
of PROS1 to the growth medium (Figure 2I). Taken
together, our data show that PROS1 is highly expressed
in OSCC cells and that the KD of PROS1 reduces cell
proliferation, a phenotype that can be rescued by the
addition of exogenous PROS1.

We next evaluated the effect of PROS1 knockdown
on anchorage-independent growth in SCC-25 cell lines
using the soft agar assay. Compared to shGFP, shPS1 and
shPS2 cells developed significantly fewer colonies in soft
agar after 14 days in culture. Colony numbers generated
by shPS1 and shPS2 decreased by 54% (P = 0.019) and
72% (P = 0.005), respectively (Figure 3D).

Reduction of tumor growth in-vivo following
PROS1 knockdown
To determine whether PROS1 inhibition could also
constrain OSCC tumorigenic potential in-vivo, SCC1 cells
were injected subcutaneously into the flanks of immunedeficient nude mice. At 7 weeks post implantation PROS1
knockdown tumors had significantly smaller tumor
volumes with 66% smaller tumors for shPS1 cells (27
mm3 mean tumor volume, P < 0.03), and 96.2% smaller
tumors for shPS2 (3 mm3 mean tumor volume, P < 0.001),
compared to shEV (78 mm3 mean tumor volume) (Figure
4A, 4B). Two injection foci of shPS2 did not develop
tumors by the end of the experiment.
Sections of shEV, shPS1 and shPS2 were next
subjected to pathological evaluation for the degree of
differentiation in the various tumors. Differentiation was
scored by a modification of the conventional grading
system described by Anneroth, et al. [24]. While 100%
(6/6) of shEV tumors scored as poorly differentiated, as
did 100% (8/8) tumors of the parental SCC1 cell line,
only 5 of 8 (62.5%) shPS1 and 1/6 (16.6%) tumors of
shPS2 received this score. Among shPS1 tumors, 66%
(4/6) were graded as moderate-to-well differentiated
and 16.6% (1/6) was graded either as poorly or poorlyto-moderately differentiated. SCC1-shPS2 tumors also
exhibited a higher degree of differentiation, with 2/8
(25%) tumors moderately differentiated, 1/8 (12.5%)
poorly-to-moderately differentiated.
To allow further molecular identification
and quantification of the tumor cells as a function
of PROS1 expression, we assessed the expression
levels of cytokeratins (CK) 5/6, 8/18 and 19 by
immunohistochemical analysis. Elevated levels of CK
5/6, CK 8/18 and CK 19 in OSCC patients are associated
with increased dysplasia, are correlated with acquisition of
invasive growth properties, and are considered markers for
poor clinical outcome [25–29]. Remarkably, compared to
shEV, both shPS1 and shPS2 tumors exhibited a significant
reduction in expression levels of these cytokeratins.
SCC1-shPS1 and shPS2 tumors had 69% (P=0.003) and
40% (P=0.029) lower expression of CK5/6. CK 8/18
levels were 56% (P=0.0005) and 66% (P=0.0001) lower
than shEV tumors, and CK19 levels were 35% (P=0.0001)
and 89% (P=0.027) lower, respectively (Figure 4C).

PROS1 knockdown leads to decreased OSCC cell
migration
To assess the effect of PROS1 knockdown on
OSCC cell migration we first employed the wound
healing/scratch assay. Automated scratches and live
imaging of scratch closure was performed using the
Incucyte Zoom system up to 24h. Control (shEV)
cells closed the scratch at 14 and 18 hrs for SCC-1 and
SCC-25, respectively. By contrast, SCC-1 cells stably
transfected with two different shPROS1 vectors had
only covered 63% (P = 0.0167) and 50% (P = 0.000196)
of the scratch area, respectively, and SCC25-shPS1
and SCC25-shPS2 had 50% (P = 0.029) and 40% (P =
0.0087) of the scratch area closed (Figure 3A). We also
measured cell migration employing the transwell system.
The migration of shPROS1 SCC-1 cells was inhibited by
40% ± 2.3% compared to control shEV cells (P = 0.4).
Similarly, the migration of shPROS1 SCC-25 cells was
62% ± 2.6% that of control cells (P=0.011), as measured
by crystal violet staining of cells that have migrated to
the bottom side of the insert (Figure 3B).
To gain a deeper mechanistic understanding on the
effects of PROS1 on migration, we assessed the levels
of the cadherin superfamily protein FAT1, which was
shown to be important for cell mobility and invasion
particularly in OSCC, also shown to be expressed by SCC25 cells [23]. To cover different regions of the extremely
large hFAT1 transcript (14,773 bp) we used three sets of
primers spanning different transcript regions to assess
FAT1 expression following PROS1-KD. All primer pairs
revealed inhibition of FAT1 mRNA in SCC-25 and SCC1 PROS1-KD cells (Figure 3C). Together, our results
indicate that inhibition of PROS1 decreases the migratory
capacity of OSCC cells.

We verified PROS1 expression in shEV tumors,
as well as conservation of PROS1 knockdown in
shPS1 and shPS2 tumors during in-vivo growth by
immunohistochemistry of tumor sections at the endpoint.
PROS1 immunoreactivity was observed in shEV in the
basal and intermediate cell layers, with a strong signal
in the basal cells surrounding the tumor nest structures
characteristic of OSCC. Only faint PROS1 signal was
obtained in shPS tumors (Supplementary Figure 3A-3D).
The marked reduction in cytokeratin levels following
PROS1 knockdown supports the pathological assessment,
and together with reduced tumor growth in-vivo indicate

decreased malignancy of OSCC tumors following PROS1
knockdown.
We next assessed cell proliferation in the xenograft
tumors by Ki-67 immunoreactivity. Ki-67 expression
is correlated with cell proliferation and is a prognostic
marker for various cancers. Compared to control-treated
xenografts, shPS1 tumors showed lower proliferative
activity (P=0.042; Supplementary Figure 4A), in
agreement with lower BrdU and Ki-67 levels in vitro
(Figure 2E–2G). The lower proliferation rates in tumors
inhibited for PROS1 expression also showed more
numerous apoptotic foci, and contained more apoptotic

TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase –mediated
dUTP Nick End Labeling) reaction (P=0.024 for shPS1;
P=0.001 for shPS2; Supplementary Figure 4B, 4C).
Apoptotic foci are also evident by the numerous pyknotic
nuclei, with condensed heterochromatin (Supplementary
Figure 4B, 4C). Taken together, we conclude that PROS1
knockdown increases apoptotic cell death in tumors,
which is also reflected by fewer cycling Ki-67-positive

and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC) [3,
31]. The proliferation of SCC-1 and SCC-25 parental,
control (shEV) and shPS knockdown cells was measured
following dose dependent R428 administration using
the crystal violet method. R428 treatment (50 nmol/L)
inhibited growth of the parental SCC-25 and controltreated SCC25-shEV cells by 40% (P=0.0008) and 36%
(P=0.023), respectively (Figure 6A). By contrast, the
growth rate of SCC25-shPS1 and SCC25-shPS2 in which
AXL expression is downregulated was not affected by
R428 treatment, even at a higher dose (100 nmol/L)
(Figure 6A). These results indicate that OSCC cells have
lost the AXL-mediated cell growth following PROS1
knockdown, and that this knockdown has functional
significance.
We next aimed to directly evaluate whether the
induced cell proliferation following stimulation by
PROS1 described above (Figure 1C, 1D and Figure
2H, 2I) is mediated through AXL. For this, we cultured
SCC25-shEV cells with or without exogenous PROS1,
and treated the cells with increasing concentrations of
R428. We hypothesized that if PROS1 induction of
cell growth is AXL-dependent and if PROS1 positively
upregulates AXL expression (Figure 5G–5I) then PROS1
addition may attenuate the toxic effect of R428. At the
concentrations tested, SCC25-shEV control cells that were
supplemented with PROS1 showed a decreased sensitivity
to R428, compared with that of SCC25-shEV cells not
supplemented with PROS1 (Figure 6B). Our results
show that in the absence of exogenous PROS1, R428
toxicity and inhibition of cell growth is dose-dependent
for R428 concentrations ranging from 25 nmol/L to 200
nmol/L. This effect, however, was lost after the cells were
supplemented with PROS1 (Figure 6B).
Akin to cell growth and survival (Figure 6B),
addition of exogenous PROS1 increased the BrdU
incorporation rates in SCC1-shPS1 cells by 10% (P
= 0.03), whereas R428 inhibited BrdU incorporation
of SCC1-shPS1 by 11% (P = 0.022, Figure 6C). To
understand whether PROS1 functions through AXL
in stimulating cell proliferation, we attempted rescue
with PROS1 in the presence of the AXL inhibitor R428.
Inhibiting AXL abolished the growth stimulatory effect of
PROS1 (P = not significant, Figure 6C), suggesting that
PROS1 action is chiefly mediated by AXL.
We also tested whether the expression levels of
cytokeratin 18 are responsive to PROS1 stimulation and
AXL inhibition in vitro. Interestingly, the downregulation
of cytokeratin protein observed in tumor sections (Figure
4C) was not mirrored in vitro: immunohistochemistry on
cultured shPS lines detected comparable levels of CK14,
CK18 and CK5 protein (Supplementary Figure 6A). This
is attributed to the role of the cytokeratins as intermediate
filaments which play major functional roles in epithelial
tissues via cell-cell contact through desmosomes and
hemidesmosomes as in stratified epithelium. This stratified

Regulation of AXL expression by PROS1
To reveal the molecular mechanism by which
PROS1 contributes to tumorigenesis in OSCC, we
hypothesized that PROS1 may function through the protooncogenic TYRO3, AXL and MERTK (TAM) family
of receptor tyrosine kinases, known to bind PROS1 [9,
10]. We therefore examined the status of TAM receptor
expression in our cells. In keeping with previous studies
which identified high AXL expression and AXL-mediated
oncogenic properties in OSCC and head and neck
cancers [3, 4, 6], we found AXL to be highly expressed
in our cell lines, whereas TYRO3 and MERTK levels
were barely detectable (Figure 5A). Surprisingly, the
downregulation of PROS1 by shRNA was associated
with suppression of AXL protein levels as determined
by western blot in both SCC-1 and SCC-25 cells (Figure
5B) and immunocytochemistry (Supplementary Figure
5D). Similar results were obtained by silencing PROS1
using siRNA (Figure 5C). To determine whether PROS1
silencing affected AXL transcription, AXL mRNA
levels were assessed following PROS1 silencing using
either shRNA or siRNA. Both approaches indicated that
downregulation of PROS1 resulted in inhibition of AXL
transcription (Figure 5D–5F). To confirm responsiveness
of AXL expression to PROS1, we incubated shPS1 and
shPS2 cells that have been silenced for PROS1 expression
with exogenous PROS1 protein, attempting to rescue
AXL expression. Reintroducing PROS1 into the culture
resulted in re-induction of AXL mRNA and protein levels,
as assessed by RT-qPCR (P=0.001 for sh-EV; P=0.01 for
shPS1) and western blot, respectively (Figure 5G–5I).
PROS1 knockdown did not affect the expression of Tyro3,
Mertk or Gas6 (Supplementary Figure 5A-5C) indicating
AXL as the only TAM signaling component affected by
PROS1-kd. Taken together, both silencing and rescue
approaches identify AXL expression levels are regulated
by PROS1.
To investigate the functional significance of PROS1driven AXL expression, we treated parental and PROS1knockdown cells with R428, a high affinity AXL-specific
inhibitor [30]. R428 was previously shown to effectively
block AXL phosphorylation and AXL-mediated cellular
events, including cell migration, proliferation and
angiogenesis in a variety of cancer cells, including Head

Figure 6: PROS1 modulates the sensitivity of OSCC to the AXL inhibitor R428. A. PROS1-KD cells are less sensitive to

R428. SCC-25 parental, control (shEV), shPS1 and shPS2 cells were subjected to increasing doses of the AXL TKI R248 (12.5-100 nmol/L
as indicated) for 48 hours before performing proliferation assays. Proliferation is plotted as a percentage of growth normalized to the
number of cells seeded and relative to vehicle-treated cells using the crystal violet method. Parental and control-treated SCC25 cells showed

for shPS cells that were treated with R428 (25 nmol/L) were similar to those following PROS1 knockdown alone. Scratch images are shown
immediately after scratch generation (top panels), and after fixation and staining with crystal violet 20 hours later (lower panels) for each

feature is somewhat recapitulated in the xenograft tumors
(e.g. the nested structures, Supplementary Figure 3),
but lost in culture. Indeed, dissociation of the stratified
epithelium and seeding was shown to induce changes in
cytokeratin expression [32], indicating the regulation of
keratin expression is associated to tissue cytoarchitecture
[33]. The KRT18 mRNA levels of cultured SCC1-shPS
cells were nevertheless responsive to PROS1 expression,
and was downregulated in PROS1-kd cells (P=0.0002).
Expression of KRT18 mRNA was rescued following
addition of PROS1 (P=0.0096), but this rescue was
attenuated in the presence of R428 (Supplementary Figure
6B). These results indicate the regulation of CK18 – a
marker of OSCC tumor aggressiveness [26, 28] by PROS1
and AXL, and highlight the vital contribution of stratified
tissue architecture for CK18 protein expression.
Finally, to assess whether the decreased migratory
capacity following PROS1 inhibition (Figure 3) is also
mediated through AXL, we assessed wound healing
closure of SCC1-shPS1 cells in the presence of PROS1 or
R428. In keeping with our previous results, inhibition of
PROS1 attenuated closure of the scratch area (P<0.0001)
(Figure 6D 1-2’). Moreover, addition of PROS1 to these
PROS1-kd cells stimulated wound closure (P=0.001),
rescuing the wound healing phenotype (Figure 6D 3-3’).
Wound closure was similar between shPS1 cells and
shPS1 cells that were treated with R428 (P = 0.137),
suggesting PROS1 is an effective regulator of AXLmediated migration. This is further stressed by the fact that
addition of R428 eliminated the rescue effect of PROS1
(P = 0.157, Figure 6D 3-5’). Taken together, these results
indicate that targeting PROS1 has a major impact on AXL
expression and AXL-related cellular proliferation and
migration.

increased apoptotic foci, in agreement with AXL being a
mediator of tumor cell survival [34]. High PROS1 levels
were found to be correlated with high AXL levels in tongue
SCC cell lines derived from patients (Supplementary
Figure 1) [22]. Finally, the downregulation of AXL
expression following PROS1 knockdown suggests
therapeutic relevance to PROS1 inhibition.
There is considerable evidence linking the
overexpression of TAM receptors in tumor cells, leading
to increased proliferation, migration, survival and drug
resistance in a multitude of cancers [1]. Among TAM
family members, AXL overexpression is most prominent
in various tumor models [34–37] and its inhibition was
shown to reduce tumorigenesis and metastasis in several
experimental models both in culture and in mice, including
breast and lung [30, 31, 35, 38] Acute Myeloid Leukemia
[39], head and neck and oral squamous cell carcinomas [3–
6, 31, 35]. Thus, understanding the molecular regulation
of AXL expression in tumor cells is of great importance.
Consequently, AXL has become an attractive therapeutic
target [36, 37, 40], leading to the development of AXL
inhibitors, with several molecules in preclinical phases and
R428 (licensed as BGB324) being the first small molecule
AXL inhibitor tested in clinical trials [41].
We previously identified PROS1 as an in-vivo ligand
for TAM receptors in the mouse eye, where it is important
for the circadian uptake of photoreceptor outer segments
by retinal pigment epithelium [11], mediated through
MERTK [10]. PROS1 was further demonstrated to
activate TAM signaling in the regulation of inflammation
and immune response [15]. MERTK was recently found
to be overexpressed in head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma tumors (HNSCC), where its inhibition reduced
the migratory potential of HNSSC cells [2]. Although we
cannot rule out the involvement of TYRO3 and MERTK
in mediating OSCC tumorigenicity, we believe this is
less likely as their basal expression levels was barely
detectable by real-time qPCR (Figure 5A), and expression
of TYRO3, MERTK and GAS6 remained unchanged
following PROS1-KD (Supplementary Figure 5). By
contrast, we found AXL to be the predominantly expressed
TAM receptor in our SCC-1 and SCC-25 cells (Figure
5A), as was also reported for additional OSCC cell lines
[4], HNSCC cell lines and tumors [5].
The tumor-promoting properties of AXL can be
stimulated by the TAM ligand GAS6, which binds to
AXL with highest affinity [42] if co-expressed within
tumor cells [18, 43–45]. Alternatively, GAS6 expressed
by the tumor microenvironment was also shown to
activate AXL in a paracrine manner [19, 46]. Indeed,
activation of AXL by GAS6 was demonstrated in various
cancer models [4, 17, 19, 20]. However, a ligandindependent mechanism was also demonstrated for AXL
activation either by reactive oxygen species [47, 48],
by homodimerization upon AXL overexpression [49,
50], or by heterodimerization with EGFR (epidermal

DISCUSSION
In this report, we reveal a fundamental and
previously unknown role for PROS1 in OSCC malignancy.
We identify high expression of PROS1, a ligand for the
TAM receptors and a potent blood anticoagulant in OSCC
cell lines, and show that endogenously expressed PROS1
is associated with multiple tumorigenic phenotypes.
PROS1 stimulates proliferation and migration of OSCC
cell lines and inhibition of PROS1 expression decreased
proliferation, migration and anchorage-independent
growth. Furthermore, knockdown of PROS1 reduced
tumor growth in a xenograft transplantation model.
Tumors inhibited for PROS1 expression appeared
histologically more differentiated, and had downregulated
expression of cytokeratins associated with increased
tumor cell aggressiveness. We further reveal that PROS1
regulates the expression of AXL kinase, and demonstrate
that PROS1-mediated cell growth and migration is AXLdependent. Tumors inhibited for PROS1 expression were
characterized by attenuated proliferation coupled with

growth factor receptor) as was shown in a breast cancer
model [8]. Thus, in keeping with the cloning of AXL as
a transforming gene overexpressed in myeloid leukemia
[51] high expression levels of AXL may facilitate its
ligand-independent activation. Although we cannot
exclude the possibility that PROS1 directly stimulates
AXL in the OSCC cell lines tested, this possibility seems
less likely, as the binding of PROS1 to AXL in other cell
types tested did not stimulate AXL phosphorylation and
downstream signaling [10, 52]. It is tempting to speculate
that PROS1-driven AXL expression may lead to functional
receptor heterodimerization with EGFR, as was shown
for HNSCC and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma [6].
Our results show that knockdown of PROS1 reduced AXL
protein levels in the OSCC lines tested (Figure 5B, 5C),
and that stimulation of these cells with PROS1 rescued
AXL expression (Figure 5G–5I). Axl expression is also
negatively regulated by the microRNAs (miR) miR-34
and miR-199a/b, with an inverse correlation between AXL
protein levels and miR-34a expression found in a panel of
cancer cell lines [53]. Interestingly, a meta-analysis study
corroborated previous findings that decreased expression
of miR-34a in HNSCC is associated with poor prognosis
[54]. Akin to AXL, PROS1 expression was recently found
to be inversely correlated to miR-34a in HepG2 hepatoma
cells [55]. This report, together with our findings presented
herein, raise the speculation whereby miR-34a and PROS1
possibly act synergistically to increase AXL expression:
initially, low miR-34a expression leads to upregulated
PROS1 [55] and AXL levels [53]. Subsequently, a
parallel pathway is engaged in which the high levels of
PROS1 further upregulate AXL transcription and protein
(this paper). Together, the cumulative impact results in a
feed-forward mechanism to increase AXL expression in
tumor cells. However, further studies are needed to reveal
the exact mechanisms by which PROS1 regulates AXL
expression.
Our histologic analysis of in-vivo xenograft tumors
reveals the expression of PROS1 by circumferential cells
delineating the keratin nest-like structures (Supplementary
Figure 3A, 3C), equivalent to the proliferative basal cell
layer of the oral mucosal epithelium in human OSCC
tumors, and consistent with high PROS1 expression shown
to be confined to the epidermal basal layer in human skin
[56]. Taken together, the normal expression of PROS1 in
the epidermal basal layer, its high expression in the basal
cell layer of OSCC xenograft tumors and its proliferative
effect on OSCC cells (Figure 1C, 1D and Figure 2C–2I)
suggest a role for PROS1 in the regulation of epithelial
cell proliferation, and that dysregulated PROS1 expression
may contribute to OSCC etiology. Accordingly, compared
to control-treated cells, PROS1 knockdown cells appeared
histologically more differentiated (Supplementary Figure
3A, 3B), and correlated with a reduction in cytokeratin
markers CK5/6, CK8/18 and CK19 (Figure 4) associated
with increased dysplasia and tumor aggressiveness.

In conclusion, our data indicate PROS1 is a
potential therapeutic target in OSCC, preventing tumor
cell proliferation and migration. PROS1 inhibition
can be used to downregulate AXL levels. Combined
inhibition of PROS1 and AXL may possibly allow lower
dose treatment or provide additive effects in combined
therapeutic modalities. Our study is the first to detect
and evaluate the role of PROS1 in OSCC, and prompts
further investigation for the involvement of PROS1 in
other cancer models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
Cells were grown in DMEM/F12 (Beit Haemek,
Israel) supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS, 100 U/ml
penicillin; 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin; 2 mM L-Glutamine,
at 37°C with 5% CO2. Cells were routinely checked for
mycoplasma contamination. SCC-1 and SCC-25 cell lines
originate in OSCC of the tongue. JSQ-3 originated from
the nasal vestibule. Purified human PROS1 protein was
purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories (South
Bend, IN). R428 was purchased from SYNkinase. SCC
cell lines were transiently transfected with PROS1 siRNA
(siPROS1; ON-TARGETplus, SMARTpool # L-004833;
Dharmacon) or with non-targeting siRNA (siNT ONTARGETplus, SMARTpool #D-001810; Dharmacon)
using DharmaFECT transfection reagent according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. All pLKO.1 sh vectors were
purchased from Sigma (Israel).

Plasmids and cell transfection
Stable PROS1 knockdown (KD) was achieved
in SCC1 and SCC25 cell lines using a pLKO.1 based
lenriviral system (Open Biosystems). Viral vectors with
different shRNA sequences targeting human PROS1,
and empty vector (EV) or GFP sequences were used for
control purposes. All pLKO.1 sh vectors were purchased
from Sigma (Israel). Viral particles were assembled in
293T cells, harvested from the supernatant, and used to
infect OSSC cells. Stably infected cells were selected by
puromycin 0.5 μg/ml and 1 mg/ml for SCC1 and SCC25,
respectively; SIGMA, Israel). At least two different
shPros1 constructs were used for each cell line.

Cell viability assay
Cells were seeded overnight at a density of 2,000
cells per well in 96-well plates in DMEM containing 10%
FBS and grown for the indicated time. Viable cell numbers
were determined using the XTT assay kit according to
the manufacturer's protocols (Beit Haemek). Each assay
consisted of three replicate wells and was repeated at least
three times. Data were expressed as the percentage of

cells compared with control. This was calculated from the
absorbance corrected for background.

Cells were harvested, washed once with PBS
and RNA was isolated with TRIZOL (Sigma). cDNA
was synthesized (qScript cDNA synthesis kit, Quanta
Biosciences). Real-Time reactions were performed in
triplicate using KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (2X)
(KAPA-Biosystems) following manufacture’s instructions
on a CFX96 Real Time PCR Cycler (Bio-Rad). The
reactions were normalized to β-actin or Gapdh, using the
ΔΔ threshold cycle (Ct) method. Specificity of the primers
was checked by dissociation curves. Primer sequences are
provided in Supplementary Table 1.

Cell proliferation assays: (BrdU, crystal violet)
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of
2-4 × 103 cells/well in growth medium.
For BrdU incorporation assays, when cells reached
about 40% confluence the medium was replaced with
100 microliters fresh medium containing 10 μM BrdU
(Sigma) for 2 hrs, followed by one PBS wash and fixed in
ice-cold methanol on ice for 30 min. Cells were washed in
PBS, DNA was denatured in 2N HCl for 10 min at room
temperature (RT), and neutralized with 0.1M boric acid for
10 min at RT, followed by blocking (3% FBS, 0.1% triton
X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at RT. Cells were then incubated
with rat anti-BrdU (AbD serotec) at 4°C overnight (ON).
The next day cells were washed 3 times in PBS and
incubated with a fluorescently-tagged anti Rat antibody
(Jackson Immunoresearch) for 1 hr at RT, followed by 3
PBS washes. Finally, nuclei were stained with Hoechst (0.1
μg/ml) for 5 mins, washed and mounted with Fluoromount
G (Southern Biotech). Images were taken with an Olympus
BX51 fluorescent microscope mounted with a DP72 camera.
For monitoring cell growth using the crystal violet
assay, wells were fixed at the designated time points (24,
48, 72, 96 hr) with 100% ice-cold methanol on ice for 30
min, and stained with crystal violet solution (1% crystal
violet in 2% ethanol) up to 30 min at room temperature.
Cells were then washed three times with tap water and
left to dry before documentation. Proliferation rates was
calculated following elution of the crystal violet in 2%
SDS in DDW, and the absorbance was measured at 595
nm using the iMark microplate reader (Bio-Rad). The
triplicates that were fixed 24h after seeding served as a
normalizing control for the number of cells seeded. All
cell counts were performed in triplicates, with at least
three biological repetitions.

Western blot
Cells were harvested, washed once with PBS, and
whole cell lysates were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM
HEPES pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA, 10%
glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM Na3VO4, 1 mM NaF).
Phosphatase and protease Inhibitor cocktails (Sigma)
were added freshly. Protein was determined using the
BCA method (Thermo Fisher) following manufacturer’s
instructions. Equal protein amounts were separated by
SDS-PAGE on 8% or 10% Tris-glycine, then transferred to
PVDF membranes (Millipore), blocked in 5% skim milk
(BD Difco) for 1 hour at RT, and reacted with primary
antibody (as listed in Supplementary Table 1) overnight at
4°C. Next day the membrane was washed 3 times in 1X
TBST for 10 min at RT. Incubation with secondary HRPconjugated antibody in blocking buffer for 1 hour at RT
was followed by 4 washes in TBST and blots were reacted
with ECL substrate (Western blot detection kit, Advansta).
Images were captured using a ChemiDocTM MP Image
System (Bio-Rad), and band quantification was done using
the ChemiDoc software.

Anchorage-independent growth
Colony formation in soft agar was assayed in triplicate
by plating 30,000 of the indicated cells in a layer of 0.35%
(w/v) agar in assay medium, on top of a 0.7% (w/v) agar
layer. Plates were incubated at 37 °C and 5% (v/v) CO2 for
14 d, and the medium was replaced every 4 d. Colonies were
stained using 0.005% (w/v) Crystal Violet solution, and an
image of the whole well was acquired using an Olympus
SZ10 stereoscope mounted with a DP72 camera. Colonies
were counted using ImageJ software (http://imagej.nih.gov/
ij/), and the mean ± SEM were calculated average number
of colonies per well was calculated.

Cell migration assay
In vitro cell migration assays were performed using
millicell filter chambers (8 μM pore size, Millipore).
Logarithmic phase cells were resuspended in serum-free
medium and 200 μl of the cell suspension (3×105 cells)
was added to the upper chamber. The lower chamber
medium was supplemented with 21 μg/mL fibronectin
(Sigma), used as a chemoattractant. Following incubation
for 16 hrs at 5% CO2, 37°C, cells in the upper chamber
were removed with a cotton swab, and migrated cells
on the lower surface were stained with 2% crystal
violet. Migration assays were performed in triplicates
or sextuplicates. The membranes were allowed to dry,
documented using an Olympus DP72 camera mounted on
an Olympus inverted microscope (CKX41). Migration rate
was then calculated following elution of the crystal violet
as described above.

Wound-healing assay
Indicated cells were seeded in a 6 or 96 well
plate until formation of a confluent monolayer, and a
“wound” was created by scratching the monolayer with
a p10 sterile pipette tip. Cells were washed with PBS and

growth medium was replaced with fresh growth medium.
The wound was photographed (× 40 magnification) after
matching a reference point in a phase-contrast microscope
and wound area was measured using the T-scratch
software. Alternatively, 4x104 cells were plated in 96 wells
and allowed to adhere overnight. The 96 well plate was
inserted into Incucyte Zoom system (Essen Biosciences),
which performed automated scratches. The migration was
monitored by phase imaging with an acquisition every
2 hrs, for 24 hrs. The Incucyte Zoom analysis software
automatically calculated the cell coverage area. All
wound-healing experiments were performed in between
3-6 replicates per experiment.

at R.T. Cells were then Hoechst-stained, mounted and
observed. Images were taken using a C2 Nikon confocal
microscope.

Drug treatment
5000 cells/well were seeded in triplicates or
sextuplicates on 96 well plates in full growth medium.
Cells were allowed to adhere for 24 hours, when a
triplicate for each cell line was fixed and served for
cell number normalization. For all other triplicates,
the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium
containing increasing concentrations of R428. Cells were
further incubated for another 48 hours in the presence of
R428, fixed and quantified using the crystal violet method.
Cell number is presented as fold (in %) over the number
of cells seeded.

Xenograft tumor formation in mice
Pools of stably transformed cells expressing the
control (EV) or shPros1 constructs (2 × 106 cells per site
in 100 μl of serum-free media using a 26-gauge needle)
were injected into the flank of NOD/SCID mice. Tumor
growth was monitored by caliper measurement. Veterinary
care was provided to all animals by the Hebrew University
animal care facility staff in accordance with AAALAC
standard procedures and as approved by the Hebrew
University Ethics committee.

Immunohistochemistry and histopathological
analysis
Primary tumors were harvested and immersionfixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde, processed, embedded in
paraffin and sectioned. For PROS1 immunostaining, Heat
induced antigen retrieval was performed in Citrate buffer
(0.1 M Na-Citrate (pH=6.0); 0.05% Tween-20 in PBS), the
sections blocked (5% NGS; 0.05% Triton X-100 in PBS)
for 1 hr at room temperature, and incubated overnight at
4°C with anti -human PROS1 antibody (DAKO). The
sections were thoroughly washed in PBS and incubated
with secondary antibody. For HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody, the colorimetric reaction was developed using
DAB substrate, followed by Hematoxylin counter staining.
For Fluorescently-conjugated secondary antibodies, slides
were mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotech).
Cytokeratin staining was performed by the Hadassah
Pathology department with an automated Benchmark
XT IHC system. Anti-cytokeratin 5/6 (Invitrogen Cat #
18-0267; 1:100) IHC was performed using the standard
CC1 antigen retrieval protocol (64 mins) followed by
anti CK5/6 iantibody incubation (40 min at 37°C), and
ultraview universal DAB. For CK8/18 (Dako; Cat #
M3652; 1:50) and anti CK19 (Dako M0888; 1:75), tissue
was pre-treated with Protease I (8 min) followed by
antibody incubation at 37°C and DAB (Ventana, Tuscon,
AZ). Anti CK8/18 was incubated for 40 min and processed
with ultraview DAB; anti CK19 was incubated for 32 min
and processed with i-view DAB. Images were taken using
Olympus BX51 microscope mounted with an Olympus
DP72 camera.
For pathological evaluation, tumors sections were
stained with Haematoxylin and Eosin, and scoring was
performed using criteria-based routine pathological methods
based on a modification of the conventional grading
system [24] by an oral pathologist who was blinded to the
experimental design. Briefly, the histologic malignancy

immunohistochemistry according to standard protocols.
Briefly, sections were deparaffinized in xylenes followed
by rehydration in ethanol series, and equilibrated in PBS.
Antigen retrieval was performed in 10 mM Na-citrate
buffer (pH 6); 0.05% tween-20 in a pressure cooker
for 20 mins, washed in PBS several times, blocked
and incubated with anti-Ki-67 overnight at 4°C. The
sections were washed the next day, incubated with a

according to manufacture’s instructions.
For cytokeratin immunohistochemistry on
cultured cells: all solutions were prepared in PBS
with Ca2+ and Mg2+. Cells were washed and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde for 10 mins at RT, washed and
permeabilized with 0.5% NP-40 in PBS for 10 mins at
R.T., followed by another PBS wash. Cells were then
blocked in 20% FCS in PBS for 15 mins at R.T in a humid
chamber. Primary antibody was added at the indicated
dilution (see Supplementary Table 2) for 1 hr at R. T,
washed and incubated with secondary antibody 30 min

Data represent mean ± SEM of experiments. At least
three independent experiments were performed per assay.
Significance was determined using a Student’s t test,
The results of quantitative studies are reported as
mean ± SEM. The SEM was calculated on the basis of
the number of independent experiments. Differences were
analyzed by the Student t test considering P<0.001 as
extremely significant (***), P<0.01 as highly significant
(**) and P<0.05 as statistically significant (*). P < 0.05
were regarded as significant.
