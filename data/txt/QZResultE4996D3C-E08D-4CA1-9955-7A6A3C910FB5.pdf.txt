Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a
Biomarker in Renal Cell Carcinoma*
Ivan Pedrosa, MD, David C. Alsop, PhD, and Neil M. Rofsky, MD

The ability to noninvasively discriminate the most common types of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) based on
their magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appearances or their magnetic resonance phenotypes is achievable. Intracellular lipids, a histologic characteristic of the clear cell RCC, can be identified on chemical shift
MRI. Intratumoral hemosiderin deposition, as observed histologically with papillary RCC, correlates to the
low signal intensity on T2-weighted images. In addition to morphologic imaging features, the different subtypes of RCC have distinct patterns of enhancement on dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. Clear cell tumors
demonstrate much greater enhancement than papillary and chromophobe RCCs during the corticomedullary and nephrographic phases. The MRI technique arterial spin labeling (ASL) uses magnetic fields to label
the water protons in arterial blood and measures blood flow into tissue; quantitative images of blood flow
can be generated without exogenous contrast media. Multiple measurements of tumor perfusion may be
repeated before and after a physiologic or drug challenge (ie, antiangiogenic therapy). In RCC xenografts
and in patients with metastatic RCC, ASL MRI assessments can be used to monitor blood flow changes in
response to antiangiogenic therapies. High blood flow on ASL MRI in RCC xenografts correlates with viable
tumor at histopathologic analysis, whereas zones of absent or diminished signal correspond to necrosis.
ASL MRI has the potential to serve as a biomarker for patients with metastatic RCC by offering a noninvasive measure of tumor blood flow changes accompanying antiangiogenic therapy. Cancer 2009;115(10

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a heterogeneous disease and includes multiple subtypes that differ in
their histopathologic features, genetic expression pattern, and clinical behavior.1,2 During the last 2 decades, significant advances in the diagnosis, staging, and treatment of patients with RCC have resulted in
improved survival in selected patients.3
Recent discoveries in the genetics of RCC have provided the opportunity for new molecularly targeted
therapies in patients with metastatic RCC, including immunotherapy and antiangiogenic therapies.4,5 The success of such targeted therapies relies on an accurate histologic subtyping of the tumors. Percutaneous biopsy can
provide a presurgical ‘‘tissue diagnosis’’ in selected patients, although inaccurate tumor subtyping rates can be as
high as 26% in sampled primary renal tumors.6,7 Therefore, a method to accurately characterize the histologic

subtype of renal masses that is robust, noninvasive, and
insensitive to sampling errors would have utility in clinical
practice.
Traditional assessments of tumor response to anticancer therapies such as the Response Evaluation Criteria
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) or the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria are based on size criteria. The limitations of these methods in detecting the activity of new
cytostatic therapies, such as antiangiogenic and targeted
therapies, has been documented in different metastatic
tumors, including RCC.8-11 New imaging techniques
that interrogate changes in tumor microenvironment and
vascularity as biomarkers for response to these therapies of
tumor cells are under intense evaluation. Preliminary
results using some of these techniques are encouraging
and support their incorporation into clinical practice as
well as into clinical trials.12
In this article, we review the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a biomarker, defined as a tool to
noninvasively detect intratumoral anatomic, physiologic,
biochemical, or molecular parameters,13 to characterize primary and metastatic RCC as well as its response to antitumor therapy. We present some of the MRI findings used for
the determination of the histologic subtype in RCC, including imaging findings on conventional MRI and enhancement patterns on dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI.
Novel MRI techniques for assessment of tumor vascularization and response to anticancer therapy, including arterial
spin labeling (ASL), breath-hold proton spectroscopy,
blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging, and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), are discussed.
MRI Phenotypes in RCC
Clear cell (65%-70%), papillary (15%-20%), and chromophobe (6%-11%) RCCs represent the most common
subtypes of RCC and differ in their prognosis and biologic behavior14 as well as in their response to available
therapies.15 In addition to the ability of MRI to accurately
characterize renal lesions as neoplasms,16-20 an ability to
noninvasively discriminate the various types of RCC
based on their MRI appearances or magnetic resonance
phenotypes is achievable.21,22
The presence of intracytoplasmic vacuoles containing lipids, a histologic characteristic of the clear cell subtype, can be recognized with the use of chemical shift

MRI techniques.23 The presence of intratumoral lipids
results in a decrease in signal intensity on T1-weighted,
opposed-phase images compared with the in-phase images
in the non-necrotic ‘‘viable’’ tumor (Fig. 1). Areas of ‘‘viable’’ tumor containing lipids, as demonstrated on chemical shift images, enhance after administration of contrast.
This allows for differentiation from areas of engulfed retroperitoneal fat within the tumor, which characteristically
do not enhance. Reports on the value of this finding for
the correct subtyping of a malignant renal mass as clear
cell RCC indicate between 42% and 82% sensitivity and
between 94% and 100% specificity.21,24
The presence of retroperitoneal collaterals, renal
vein thrombosis, and intratumoral necrosis on MRI each
predict high-grade clear cell subtype, whereas intratumoral necrosis directly relates to tumor size for clear cell
carcinomas.21 A tumor capsule of low signal intensity on
T1- and T2-weighted images may be observed, and its
interruption is associated with locally advanced disease
and higher nuclear grade.25,26
The majority (85%) of predominantly cystic neoplasms that contain ‘‘simple’’ fluid and small solid components and/or thickened or irregular septae represent lowgrade clear cell RCCs.20,21 In contradistinction, cystic
neoplasms with hemorrhagic contents and peripheral
solid papillary projections are more commonly papillary
neoplasms.21
Papillary carcinomas have other distinct MRI features that correlate with their unique histopathologic
characteristics.27,28 These tend to be located in the surface
of the kidney, they are small in size, and they have
homogeneous and lower signal intensity compared with
the cortex on T2-weighted images.21,27,28 The latter characteristic has been correlated with cytoplasmic or interstitial histiocytic hemosiderin deposition22 and provides an
accurate distinction from clear cell RCC, which typically
exhibits heterogeneously increased signal intensity on T2weighted images.21,27 The histologic characteristics of
cystic papillary RCC may be evident on diffusion tensor
MRI because of restriction of the motion of water molecules along the well developed fibrous capsule and the fibrovascular core in the papillary projections.29 The
overall sensitivity and specificity of MRI to predict the
histologic subtype using a feature analysis is 92% and
83% for clear cell RCC, and 80% and 94% for papillary
RCC, respectively.21

MRI Assessment of Tumor Vascularity
in RCC
Capitalizing on the unique attributes of tumor microvasculature and the dependency of tumor growth on vascular
recruitment,30 contemporary cross-sectional imaging
techniques that assess tumor vascularity are of increased
interest and relevance. Such techniques are particularly
attractive in the era of targeted antiangiogenic therapies
applicable to a variety of cancers.
Traditional assessments of tumor progression based
on size criteria (ie, RECIST, WHO criteria) often are
inadequate to assess tumor response to cytostatic therapies.10 These new systemic therapies induce changes in
tumor vascularity that precede those in size. Thus, there is
a need for imaging tools that robustly and reproducibly
can monitor alterations in tumor vascularity with a potential to serve as a surrogate for tumor response. MRI is
uniquely suited to this task because it provides a variety of
2336

ways to assess changes in tumor vascularity either with or
without exogenous contrast media.
DCE-MRI

DCE-MRI allows for interrogation of tumor signal
intensity before, during, and after the intravenous administration of a bolus of contrast. The accumulation of the
contrast agent in the tumor over time can be used to
extract quantitative information regarding the functional
integrity of tumor microvasculature.31 Compared with
DCE-computed tomography (CT), the lack of associated
ionizing radiation and the excellent sensitivity of MRI to
detect small amounts of intravenous contrast are potential
advantages for its use in DCE imaging protocols. Most
DCE-MRI protocols use the standard gadolinium-based
extracellular contrast agents that are common to clinical
practice. These are small-molecular-weight contrast
agents that diffuse variably between the intravascular and

extravascular spaces based on vascular permeability in the
tumor bed.
The rate of delivery and washout of contrast media
into the tumor vascular bed depends on several physiologic characteristics of the tumor vascular microenvironment. With DCE-MRI, these characteristics are reflected
in the determination of the intratumoral vascular volume
fraction, the tumor blood flow, the vascular permeabilitysurface area product, and the accessible extravascularextracellular space.32,33 These values, although considered
quantitative, are derived from a series of assumptions
regarding compartmental tracer kinetics.34 DCE-MRI
has been used to evaluate the response to antiangiogenic
therapies in a variety of cancers both in patients35-37 and
in animal models.38-41
MRI sequences used for DCE examinations are
2-dimensional (2D) or 3-dimensional (3D), T1-weighted
gradient echo sequences, most of which are similar to or
derived from those used in routine clinical practice. The
3D sequences have the advantage of covering larger anatomic areas and provide a volumetric assessment of tumor
vascularity. In contrast, 3D acquisitions are vulnerable to
breathing artifacts compared with the relatively motioninsensitive 2D acquisitions. In an effort to determine the
tumor perfusion, most DCE-MRI research protocols are
tailored to demonstrate tumor vascularity during the initial portion of the bolus and, thus, use a high temporal
resolution/low spatial resolution approach. However, the
spatial resolution and/or the anatomic coverage required
to evaluate a specific tumor affects the achievable temporal
resolution. Ultimately, a particular DCE-MRI protocol
represents a compromise between the temporal and spatial
resolution (including anatomic coverage) based on the nature and location of the tumor.
For example, an assessment of a highly vascularized
tumor in the upper abdomen (eg, clear cell RCC) would
require a DCE-MRI protocol with high temporal resolution that is relatively insensitive to respiratory motion; a
sacrifice in the anatomic coverage and/or spatial resolution
is inherent to achieving these simultaneous goals. In contradistinction, DCE-MRI protocols for relatively hypovascular tumors located in organs with a limited range of motion
(eg, breast, prostate) can use a lower temporal/higher spatial
resolution volumetric (3D) acquisition.
The dynamic contrast enhancement features of the
different histologic subtypes of RCC may assist in the
Cancer

imaging diagnosis. By using DCE-CT, it has been demonstrated that clear cell RCCs enhance more avidly and
heterogeneously than papillary tumors.42,43 Furthermore,
quantitative kinetic parameters of tumor vascularity on
DCE-CT correlate with microvascular density in RCC.44
The 3 most common subtypes of RCC, clear cell, papillary, and chromophobe tumors, can be distinguished
based on their enhancement patterns using a simple 3D
DCE-MRI protocol with a precontrast dataset and 2 postcontrast datasets.45 Clear cell tumors exhibit a greater percentage enhancement during the corticomedullary and
nephrographic phases than papillary tumors, whereas
chromophobe RCCs exhibit an intermediate percentage
enhancement at both phases.45
Some of the limitations of DCE-MRI in clinical trials include the poor standardization of the imaging technique across different vendors and the quantification of
tumor perfusion. The latter is particularly challenging
when using extracellular contrast agents because these
undergo different degrees of transendothelial diffusion,
depending on the permeability of the tumor blood vessels.
The relative contribution of vessel leakiness (ie, permeability) and tumor blood flow to the overall signal intensity changes observed on DCE-MRI frequently is
unknown. Often and erroneously, those 2 terms are used
interchangeably, which can be confusing when interpreting data. Different tumor compartment modeling
approaches have been proposed to correct for this variability and may be applicable to specific tumors.33,46 However, accurate determination of tumor perfusion using
these models may not be possible for all tumors.
Recently, intravascular contrast agents that do not
diffuse into the extravascular space have been developed
and have the potential to offer additional information
regarding the tumor aggressiveness and its response to
antiangiogenic therapy.47,48 At the time of this writing,
few are available worldwide and none are approved by the
Food and Drug Administration.
ASL MRI

ASL is an MRI technique for the measurement of
blood flow into tissue that uses magnetic fields to label the
nuclear spins of the endogenous water in arterial blood.49
Quantitative images of blood flow can be generated that
can be used as quantitative markers for response to therapy. ASL has been used widely in animal studies and in

humans, and different versions of the technique have been
validated in animals using microspheres50 and in the normal human brain using H2O15 positron emission tomography.51 Initial clinical applications of ASL have been
focused on benign neurologic disorders.52-54 The history
of the development of the ASL MRI technique is summarized in Table 1.43,44,49,50,55-72
There are several potential advantages of using ASL
techniques for the evaluation of tumor perfusion. First,
because no intravenous contrast is administered, multiple
measurements may be performed without accumulating
tracer materials. Thus, assessment of tumor perfusion at
multiple time points and before and after physiologic or
drug challenges (ie, antiangiogenic therapy) is readily
achievable. Second, compared with DCE-MRI, there is
no ambiguity regarding the contribution of permeability
and blood flow to signal intensity; signal intensity on ASL
is directly proportional to blood flow.
Some of the limitations of the current implementations of ASL techniques include the lack of widespread
commercial availability, its better suitability for higher
flow tumors, and the limited anatomic coverage provided
by the 2D acquisitions. Future implementations of the
technique using 3D acquisitions will further improve the
evaluation of tumor response by providing a volumetric
assessment of tumor perfusion.
de Bazelaire et al73 demonstrated the feasibility of
this technique to monitor response to antiangiogenic therapy in RCC metastases. In a recent trial, ASL and DCEMRI were used to assess the response of patients with met2338

astatic RCC to an antiangiogenic therapy with PTK787/
ZK 222584 (Vatalinib; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East
Hanover, NJ; Schering AG, Berlin, Germany).74 Early
changes at 1 month in blood flow and tumor size were
compared with tumor size changes at 4 months. ASL
blood flow changes were correlated significantly with time
to progression, whereas tumor size and DCE-MRI blood
flow changes at 1 month were not. No correlation was
observed between blood flow changes and tumor size
changes at 1 month. If validated, the sensitivity of ASL to
detect early changes in tumor vascularity shortly after the
initiation of therapy may play an important role in determining the effectiveness of new antiangiogenic drugs in
these patients (Fig. 2).
ASL can be used to detect early changes in therapeutic response to antiangiogenic therapy in animal tumor
models.75 Schor-Bardach et al recently studied the
response rate to sorafenib therapy of 3 different human
RCC xenografts implanted in nude mice. Caki-1 (sorafenib resistant), A498 (sorafenib sensitive), and 786-0 (early
response followed by rapid development of resistance by
Day 5) tumors exhibited different levels of blood flow on
ASL MRI at baseline.75 Specifically, Caki-1 tumors demonstrated minimal blood flow at baseline (10.2 mL  9.0
mL/100 mg/minute) relative to 786-0 tumors (75.1 mL
 28.6 mL/100 mg/minute) and A498 tumors (80.1 mL
 23.3 mL/100 mg/minute). These findings correlated
with the lack of response of Caki-1 tumors to sorafenib
therapy, possibly suggesting that low levels of perfusion
on ASL may be a useful biomarker for predicting poor

responsiveness to certain types of antiangiogenic
therapy.75
Although blood flow changes on ASL after antiangiogenic therapy varied in these animal models, its
regional distribution within the tumors corresponded
tightly to their histopathologic appearance. Regions with
high signal intensity on ASL correlated to viable tumor,
with zones of absent or diminished signal (ie, <2 mL/100
mg/minute) representing necrosis. In those lines that

responded to sorafenib, ASL provided important information regarding tumor viability with a tight radiologicpathologic correlation to induced intratumoral necrosis.75
Thus, the potential to use ASL as a means to base therapeutic decisions for patients with well perfused tumors
also can be appreciated.
A practical clinical application of ASL imaging is to
characterize renal lesions into those with and without
measurable blood flow, a distinction critical for
2339

Original Article

identifying neoplasms, when the administration of contrast media is not desirable (eg, in patients with substantial
renal insufficiency). The use of ASL in this manner is in
the early stages of validation.76
Spectroscopy

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) techniques
have been applied for years to the characterization of brain
lesions and the differentiation of neoplastic versus nonneoplastic tissues. MRS separates different molecular contributors to the total MRI signal by using the changes in
signal frequency induced by the molecular environment.
These frequency changes are so small that they are measured in parts per million (ppm) and require special magnetic resonance techniques for their measurement. Recent
implementation of the techniques for performing proton
MRS in the abdomen and thorax at higher field strengths
(ie, 3 T), including breath-held acquisitions,77 may facilitate the detection of unique metabolic surrogates in specific tumors. For example, MRS applied to patients with
metastatic RCC demonstrates a significantly lower ratio
of signal at a 5.4-ppm frequency shift to that at 1.3 ppm
(the latter may be correlated with the lipid content in the
voxel) in metastatic RCC compared with that in healthy
tissue, suggesting that this ratio may be a useful marker
for renal malignancy and potentially may aid in monitoring treatment.78 If such findings can be confirmed in
patients with earlier stage disease and, ideally, can be correlated with the underlying histologic and molecular features, then MRS could provide a useful metabolic
signature of the disease. Some of the limitations of MRS
as a biomarker include its relatively low spatial resolution
and the difficulty with which it can be used to assess large
tumors and, thus, to detect heterogeneity within tumors
because of the attendant time and signal-to-noise
constraints.
BOLD Imaging

The paramagnetic properties of deoxyhemoglobin,
compared with the diamagnetic characteristics of oxyhemoglobin, can be exploited to image tumor hypoxia. Differences in concentrations of deoxyhemoglobin modulate
microscopic field gradients in the vicinity of blood cells
and vessels.79 These intravoxel alterations in the magnetic
field cause loss of phase coherence, which leads to signal
2340

loss on gradient echo T2-weighted images, the so-called
BOLD contrast.
A direct correlation between oxygen levels measured
by BOLD MRI and tumor hypoxia in a variety of animal
tumor models establishes a useful tool for investigating
interventions (such as drugs) that affect tumor vasculature.80-82 BOLD studies in humans have focused primarily on gliomas, suggesting utility in monitoring vascular
reactivity.83,84 The mechanistic elements of RCC, its
hypervascular nature, and its oxygen deregulation provide
a rationale for the pursuit of BOLD imaging. To the best
of our knowledge, the ability of BOLD imaging to detect
tumor changes in patients with RCC who are undergoing
chemotherapy has not been reported.
Diffusion-weighted Imaging

Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is an MRI technique that allows for detection of the direction and magnitude of the random motion of water. Random
(Brownian) motion of water molecules within tissues
results in signal attenuation during the application of 2
balanced gradients applied symmetrically around a 180degree refocusing pulse (ie, diffusion-weighting gradients). In contrast, water molecules with restricted
motion acquire phase shifts during the application of the
first gradient that are cancelled out by the second gradient,
thus without incurring signal loss. The degree of water
diffusion within tissues, or the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), can be calculated by acquiring multiple
images with different amplitudes or durations for the diffusion-weighting gradients (b values). Increased cellularity
and decreased interstitial space result in restriction of
water motion and decreased ADC values within tumors
compared with most non-neoplastic tissues.85
An ability of DWI to function as a biomarker to predict and monitor tumor response to targeted and/or antiangiogenic therapy has been described.85,86 Preclinical
and clinical studies have demonstrated some correlation
between ADC values and tumor cellularity and grade.87
Baseline ADC values may predict the likelihood that a
patient will respond to therapy.88,89 For example, a significantly higher ADC value at baseline has been reported
for nonresponding patients with rectal adenocarcinomas
compared with the value for patients who responded to
chemotherapy and chemoradiation.89 However, the prognostic implications of the pretreatment ADC values
Cancer

May 15, 2009

MRI in RCC/Pedrosa et al

require further validation.90 Differences in the geographic
distribution of high ADC values may account for tumor
necrosis and, thus, may indicate a poor response to
therapy.90
An increase in ADC values as a result of therapyinduced tumor cell lysis and necrosis has been demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies.88 Changes
in ADC values may precede those in tumor volume, making DWI a potential biomarker for early response to therapy. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated a
positive association between therapy-induced elevation in
ADC values and better clinical outcomes to a variety of
antitumor therapies.89,91,93 However, the mechanisms
that lead to the changes in ADC values after therapy are
not completely understood. Early cellular swelling and
decreased vascularity induced by therapy may lead to a
transient decrease in ADC value in tumors that respond
effectively to treatment.85

Conclusions
An array of MRI techniques can offer the capacity to noninvasively characterize renal masses and evaluate response
to therapy in primary and metastatic disease. More widely
available imaging techniques, including T2- and T1weighted imaging, fat and water separation, and contrast
enhancement, have high sensitivity and specificity for
identifying renal mass malignancy and subtype. Several
newer techniques that are under development and evaluation offer the potential for improved characterization of
vascularity and cellularity and for monitoring therapeutic
efficacy. Although ASL imaging needs further validation,
it is particularly attractive as a quantitative method for
accurately monitoring tumor response to antiangiogenic
therapy in patients with metastatic RCC. The potential
for imaging and, in particular, for MR techniques to serve
as biomarkers needs to be carefully considered.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
correspond directly to the written article, which is a more
general review.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Dr. Bernard Escudier: How long does it take to do
1 ASL MRI?
Dr. Ivan Pedrosa: It takes about 3 minutes to
obtain an ASL acquisition in 1 anatomic location. We
start with some standard anatomic imaging to localize the
tumor Then, we typically acquire at least 2 orthogonal
planes through the tumor. In the current format, the
exam duration may vary between 20 and 45 minutes.
Dr. W. Marston Linehan: With ASL, can you tell
if a tumor is solid?
Dr. Pedrosa: The ASL technique provides information about tumor vascularity. Similar to the experience
with contrast-enhanced techniques, one could assume
that a renal mass that demonstrates vascularity throughout
is solid.
Dr. Linehan: If you are trying to follow a renal
mass, what is your best approach?
Dr. Pedrosa: We like to follow renal masses with
contrast-enhanced MRI using a high-resolution 3-dimensional technique that allows us to subtract the precontrast
dataset from the postcontrast datasets. In our experience,
this is the best tool to determine whether there is enhancement or not, particularly in a cystic lesion. We are confident that we can detect very small enhancing components
within cysts.
Dr. Linehan: If you are doing a clinical trial with a
lot of imaging, however, that is going to be a fair amount
of contrast.
Dr. Pedrosa: Yes, but unless there is severe renal
failure, we believe that gadolinium MR is safer than contrast-enhanced CT.
Dr. Gary Hudes: How much experience is there in
terms of ASL baseline flow with response to any antiangiogenic treatment?
Dr. Pedrosa: As far as I know, our experience in the
human xenografts implanted in mice is the only evidence
that we have that the differences in baseline flow are predictive of response.
Dr. Michael Atkins: In addition, this type of
approach could help one choose both the right time and
the right part of the tumor to biopsy.
Dr. Hudes: Is there any experience right now with
DC MRI in terms of response in patients?
Dr. Pedrosa: There are very limited data. Our initial trial included both ASL and DCE MRI. In contradistinction to the ASL technique, we did not find a definitive
2341

Original Article

correlation between early changes on DCE MRI and
changes in tumor size at 4 months. However, I know
other groups are working on this approach, and they may
show different results.
Dr. Jeffrey Sosman: How early do you think you
could look? Have you taken this back even closer to the
initiation of therapy?
Dr. Pedrosa: The earliest changes in perfusion we
have seen were within 7 days, with complete disappearance of the perfusion in some cases; but, again, we have
not performed ASL imaging earlier than that.
Dr. Sosman: What does normalization of blood
flow mean for the ASL?
Dr. Pedrosa: ASL MRI uses arterial blood as an endogenous contrast agent, so the quantification of tumor
perfusion is not affected by increased tumor permeability.
This technique has been validated, and there is a tight correlation between signal intensity on ASL and blood flow
measured with other techniques. However, we have not
investigated the potential advantage of ASL MR in determining ‘‘normalization’’ of tumor blood flow.
