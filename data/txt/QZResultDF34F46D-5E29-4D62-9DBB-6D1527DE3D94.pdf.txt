BACKGROUND: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is a malignancy with a dismal prognosis. Previous studies have suggested that in pancreatic cancer, human equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1 (hENT-1) and ribonucleoside reductase
subunit M1 (RRM1) expression may have prognostic value as well as predictive value with sensitivity to gemcitabine.
This study investigated the prognostic value of hENT-1 and RRM1 expression in resected pancreatic cancer. METHODS: Eighty-four patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy from 2000 to 2005 were included in this study.
Patients were followed for a median of 60 months (range, 44-110). Total RNA was isolated from macrodissected paraffin-embedded tumors. hENT-1 and RRM1 expression levels in tumors were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR), normalized to 2 reference genes, and expressed as DCt (low DCt
means high expression). Univariate and multivariable prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS) were identified via Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: Univariate analysis identified hENT-1,
overall stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and adjuvant therapy as prognostic factors for both PFS
and OS. Multivariate analysis confirmed the association of low expression of hENT-1 (DCt > 0.2027) (P ¼ .007), perineural invasion (P ¼ .021), and lack of adjuvant treatment (P < 0.001) with worse OS. Multivariate analysis also confirmed the association of low expression of hENT-1 (DCt > 0.5391) with worse PFS (P ¼ .016) in addition to overall
stage (P ¼ .013), perineural invasion (P ¼ .042), and lack of adjuvant treatment (hazard ratio 2.31, P ¼ .029). RRM1
expression was not associated with OS or PFS in the current cohort. CONCLUSIONS: Low expression of hENT-1 was
associated with worse OS and PFS in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma independent of gemcitabine

Pancreatic cancer is a very aggressive disease. In patients with resected pancreatic cancer, 5-year survival rates
remain low at 10% to 30% even with adjuvant therapy, as most patients will succumb to the disease secondary to high rate
of local and systemic reoccurrences.1,2
Many prognostic factors have been investigated thoroughly, especially from the histologic examination of the
resected tumor. For example, lymph node metastasis, the status of resection margins, tumor grade, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, and perineural invasion are important prognostic factors in pancreatic cancer.3,4
Human equilibrative transporter 1 (hENT-1) is a nucleoside transporter protein that mediates cellular entry of cytotoxic chemotherapies such as gemcitabine.5 Preclinical data have shown that sensitivity to nucleoside analogues correlates
with the expression of hENT-1. Overexpression of hENT-1 enhances gemcitabine response in human pancreatic cancer, and
cells lacking hENT-1 expression are highly resistant to gemcitabine.6,7 This protein has gained potential interest as a predictive or prognostic marker in pancreatic cancer.8-10 However, the prognostic value in resected pancreatic cancer is unclear.
Two of the studies have demonstrated that hENT-1 expression was prognostic in pancreatic cancer, but these studies

included both early (resected) and advanced disease, which
were mostly treated with gemcitabine as part of the treatment.8,9 Conversely, another study showed that hENT-1
expression was predictive but not prognostic in resected
pancreatic cancer.10 Therefore, there is no consensus on the
prognostic value of hENT-1 in resected pancreatic cancer.
Ribonucleoside reductase subunit M1 (RRM1) is an
essential enzyme that encodes the regulatory subunit of
ribonucleotide reductase and catalyzes the reduction of
ribonucleoside diphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonucleotides to be used for the de novo DNA synthesis.11,12 This biomarker, similar to hENT-1, has been
evaluated in pancreatic cancer as a potential prognostic
or predictive biomarker of gemcitabine sensitivity.13,14
There is a good rationale for this because gemcitabine is
converted into gemcitabine diphosphate, an active metabolite capable of inhibiting ribonucleoside reductase, and
RRM1 has been shown to be a determinant of gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic cancer cells under in vitro condition.13,15,16 Currently, there are few published studies
evaluating the prognostic value of expression of RRM1 in
resected pancreatic cancer, and no definite conclusion can
be made based on the published data.9,14
Based on the importance of potential biomarkers such
as hENT-1 and RRM1 in pancreatic cancer, we explored the
prognostic roles of the tumoral expression of the hENT-1
and RRM1 in a cohort of subjects with resected pancreatic
adenocarcinoma at Cleveland Clinic by using a quantitative
reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (QRTPCR) on paraffin-embedded tumor tissue.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Institutional review board approval was obtained to conduct
this study. A single institution surgical archive was searched
for patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy for
resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma from 2000 to 2005.
Patients were required to have pathologic stage of T1-3N01M0. Exclusion criteria included metastatic or unresectable
disease at time of surgery, indolent tumor types (eg, islet
cell, mucinous cystadenoma/cystadenocarcinoma, invasive
adenocarcinoma arising from intraductal mucinous neoplasm), R2 resection (positive resection margin macroscopically), and ampullary carcinoma. A total of 179 consecutive
patients were identified. Of 179 specimens, 84 patients had
tumor-containing blocks available for the study during the
study period. Total RNA was isolated from manually
macro-dissected, paraffin-embedded pancreatic adenocarcinoma in these 84 patients.

Tissue Sampling and Processing
RNA isolation from paraffin-embedded
pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples

The 84 pancreatic adenocarcinoma samples were
either formalin-fixed (n ¼ 65) or Hollande’s-fixed (n ¼
19), paraffin-embedded tissues. Hematoxylin and eosinstained slides were reviewed, and areas containing abundant tumor cells (>30% of tissue volume; range, 30%80% of tumor cells) were highlighted. Unstained slides
with 10 lm tissue section were macro-dissected to capture
these areas of concentrated tumor cells for RNA extraction. RNA isolation from these macro-dissected samples
was carried out according to a modified protocol using
High Pure RNA Paraffin Kit (Roche Applied Sciences, Indianapolis, IN). Sections were deparaffinized as described
in the manufacturer’s manual. The tissue pellet was dried
in an oven at 55 C for 10 minutes and resuspended in
100 lL of tissue lysis buffer, 16 lL 10% SDS and 80 lL
Proteinase K. The sample was vortexed and incubated in a
thermomixer set at 400 rpm for 3 hours at 55 C. Subsequent steps of sample processing were performed according to the kit manual. The RNA sample was quantified
by OD 260/280 readings using spectrophotometer and
diluted to a final concentration of 50 ng/uL. The isolated
RNA samples were stored in RNase-free water at 80 C
until use.
QRT-PCR analysis

The RRM1, hENT-1, and the housekeeping control
genes were evaluated using a 1-step multiplex QRT-PCR
assay with the RNA samples isolated from paraffin-embedded tissues. To minimize the variability of QRT-PCR
reaction, 3 housekeeping control genes (b-actin, HMBS,
and RPL13A) were used to normalize the input quantity
of RNA. To prevent any contaminating DNA in the
samples from amplification, PCR primers or probes for
QRT-PCR assay were designed to span an intron so that
the assay would not amplify any residual genomic DNA.
Total RNA (100 ng) was used for the 1-step QRT-PCR
reaction. PCR amplification was performed on the ABI
7900HT sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems,
Frenso, CA) using the 384-well block format with 10 lL
reaction volume. The concentrations of the primers and
the probes were 4 and 2.5 lmol/L, respectively. The reaction mixture was incubated at 48 C for 30 minutes for
R actithe reverse transcription, followed by an AmplitaqV

vation step at 95 C for 10 minutes and then 40 cycles of
95 C for 15 seconds for denaturing and of 60 C for 1 minute for annealing and extension. All primers and probes

were optimized towards the same amplification efficiency
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Sequences of
the primers and probes for RRM1, hENT-1 and the 3

Although 3 housekeeping genes have been used in
the RT-PCR reaction, further analyses showed that the 2
housekeeping genes HMBS and RPL13A were the most
stable genes expressed in the pancreatic cancer by NormFinder (v19) and geNorm (v3.5) software programs. The
expression of the hENT-1 and RRM1 were therefore normalized to these 2 housekeeping genes and used in the
final data analyses. More specifically, for each sample,
DCt ¼ Ct (target gene)  Ct (average of HMBS and
RPL13A) was calculated. DCt normalization has been
widely used in clinical QRT-PCR assay.17 A larger DCt
number means a lower expression of the targeted genes in
the current study.
Statistical Methods
Categorical variables are summarized as frequency counts
and percentages; continuous variables are summarized as
the mean, standard deviation, median, and range. Overall
survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were
calculated from the date of resection. The event corresponding to OS is all-cause mortality; events corresponding to PFS are disease progression or all-cause mortality.
Recursive partitioning analysis with a log-rank splitting
method was used to determine if the expression of hENT1 or RRM1 was associated with OS or PFS among all 84
study patients and among 19 patients who received adjuvant gemcitabine. When cut-points were identified, these
cut-points were carried forward into univariate and multivariate analyses. When no cut-points were identified, the

3128

expression was split into groups based on tertiles (analysis
of 84 patients). Outcome curves were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method, and groups were compared using
the log-rank test. Cox proportional hazards analysis was
used to identify prognostic factors for OS and PFS.
hENT-1, RRM1, and other additional variables were
considered as potential prognostic factors: gender, age,
interval from diagnosis to resection, T stage, tumor size,
N stage, number of positive nodes, stage, tumor location,
differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, surgical margins, and adjuvant therapy. Multivariable analysis was done using stepwise Cox analysis with a
variable entry criterion of P < .10 and a variable retention
criterion of P < .05. All Cox analyses are presented as the
hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval for the HR,
and corresponding P-value. HR <1 indicates a benefit in
R software
OS or PFS. All analyses were done using SASV
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). All statistical tests were
2-sided, and P < .05 was used to indicate statistical
significance.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
Of 179 patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, 83
patients with pT1-3N0-1M0 and 1 patient with pT2N1-M1 pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy from 2000 to 2005 were included
in this study. Patient characteristics and pathologic characteristics are listed in Table 1.
There were 49 men and 35 women with a median
age of 66 years (range, 45-93). Most of the patients
(66.7%) had node-positive disease, and 1 patient was
found to have a solitary, small metastatic lesion in the liver
intraoperatively but the patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy and therefore was included in this study.
More than half of the patients (54.8%) had moderately
differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and 45.2%
had poorly differentiated pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
Many patients (73.8%) underwent R0 resection and
26.2% underwent R1 resection. The majority of patients
(73.8%) had stage II disease and 26% stage I disease. In
terms of adjuvant treatment, 58.5% of patients received
a combination of chemotherapy and radiation, 6.1%
received only chemotherapy, and 35.4% did not receive
any adjuvant therapy. In this cohort, only 23.2% of
patients received gemcitabine-based adjuvant treatment.
The patients were followed a median of 60 months (range,
44-110). After this follow-up, 20 patients (23.8%) are still

patients who received adjuvant therapy was 32.0 months
compared with 7.2 months for observation.
Prognostic Factors Identified by Univariate
Analyses
Thirteen variables including gender, age at the time of surgical resection, hENT-1 expression, tumor stage (T stage),
tumor size, lymph node stage (N stage), number of positive nodes, overall stage, tumor differentiation, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, surgical margin
status, and adjuvant treatment were analyzed for their
association with overall survival and progression-free survival (Table 2). As shown in Table 2, number of positive
nodes (HR 1.12 per 1 node increase, P ¼ .004), overall
stage (HR 4.53 for IIA vs I, P ¼ .002; HR 2.2 for IIB vs I,
P ¼ .02), presence of lymphovascular invasion (HR 1.65,
P ¼ .05), presence of perineural invasion (HR 1.84, P ¼
.019), and no adjuvant treatment (HR 2.55, P < .001)
were associated with decreased overall survival. In addition, tumor size (HR 1.24 per 1 cm increase, P ¼ .03),
overall stage (HR 18.97 for IIA vs I, P < .001; HR 2.51
for IIB vs I, P ¼ .013), lymphovascular invasion (HR
1.99, P ¼ .024), perineural invasion (HR 2.05, P ¼
.021), and no adjuvant treatment (HR 2.99, P < .001)
were associated with decreased progression-free survival.
A larger number of positive nodes was associated with a
trend towards decreased progression-free survival (HR
1.08 per 1 node increase, P ¼ .09).
Correlation Between hENT-1 and RRM1
Expression and Patients’ Outcome
In macro-dissected samples, the quantitative RT-PCR
analyses showed that mRNAs of hENT-1 and RRM1 were
detectable in all 84 samples. Recursive partitioning analysis with a log-rank splitting method identified a cutoff
value of 0.2027 for the association of hENT-1 with overall
survival and a cutoff value of 0.5391 for the association of
hENT-1 with progression-free survival among all 84 study
patients (Table 2). Univariate analyses showed that low
expression of hENT-1 (DCt > 0.2027) (HR 1.97, P ¼
.007) were associated with decreased overall survival.
More specifically, as shown in Figure 1A, patients with
low hENT-1 expression in their pancreatic adenocarcinoma (DCt of hENT-1 > 0.2027) had worse OS than
patients with high expression levels in their pancreatic adenocarcinoma (DCt of hENT-1  0.2027) (median OS
14.8 months vs 20.0 months, P ¼ .007). In addition, univariate analysis revealed that low expression of hENT-1

progression-free survival. Patients with low hENT-1
expression (DCt of hENT-1 > 0.5391) had significantly
worse PFS than patients with high expression levels (DCt
of hENT-1  0.5391) (median PFS 4.5 months vs 11.2

into tertiles, RRM1 expression was not found to be associated with OS or PFS (Fig. 2A and 2B).

tive nodes, overall stage, tumor location, differentiation,

entry criterion of P < .10 and a variable retention criterion of P < .05. As shown in Table 3, no adjuvant therapy
(HR 2.80, P < .001), perineural invasion (HR 1.85, P ¼
.021), and lower expression of hENT-1 (DCt of hENT-1
> 0.2027) (HR 2.20, P ¼ .003) were associated with
worse OS. Similarly, as shown in Table 4, no adjuvant
therapy (HR 2.31, P ¼ .029), overall stage (HR 7.84, P ¼
.006 for IIA vs I; HR 2.00, P ¼ .07 for IIB vs I), perineural invasion (HR 2.02, P ¼ .042), and low expression of
hENT-1 (DCt > 0.5391) (HR 3.18; P ¼ .001) were associated with a worse PFS.

reported prognostic factors are overall tumor stage, lymph
node metastasis, status of resection margins, tumor
histology, tumor size, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion, and possibly even liver function test.3,18-20
Overall, these markers are routinely used clinically to
determine prognosis in patients with surgically resected
pancreatic cancer and can sometimes help us in making
decisions on adjuvant treatment. The univariate analyses
in our current cohort of resected pancreatic cancer identified known risk factors: overall stage, lymph node metastasis, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, and
lack of adjuvant treatment as poor prognostic factors,
therefore indicating that the current cohort is representative of patients with resectable pancreatic cancers.
The identification of additional prognostic markers
in pancreatic cancer remains highly desirable because it is
an aggressive malignancy. Recently, several biomarkers in
nucleoside transportation and metabolism and DNA synthesis and repair have been shown to be possibly prognostic in human cancers. Our study clearly demonstrated that
high expression of hENT-1 was associated with better

entire cohort independent of gemcitabine treatment, providing evidence supporting an overall prognostic value of
hENT-1 in resected pancreatic cancer. A prognostic role
of hENT-1 in pancreatic cancer has been implicated in 2
previous studies. However, these studies were in gemcitabine-treated pancreatic cancer, which included both
resected and metastatic disease. Giovannetti et al reported
that patients with higher levels of hENT-1 expression had
significantly longer OS, disease-free survival (DFS), and
time to progression (TTP) than those with lower transcription levels.9 Similarly, Spratlin et al showed that
patients with uniformly detectable hENT-1 immunostaining in their pancreatic adenocarcinoma had a significantly longer survival after gemcitabine chemotherapy.
This was a small study of 21 patients predominantly consisting of stage IV pancreatic cancer (16 of 21).8 However,
as stated above, 81.3% (83 of 102) of the patients in the
Giovannetti study and 100% (21 of 21) of the patients in
the Spratlin study received gemcitabine treatment as adjuvant treatment or for metastatic disease.8,9 Although both
of these retrospective studies showed a prognostic role for
hENT-1 expression in pancreatic carcinoma, most of the
patients received gemcitabine-based treatment, which is
different from our study. Our study consisted of a homogeneous population either receiving mostly concurrent
chemoradiation therapy or no adjuvant therapy and not
gemcitabine-based treatment.
One of the largest retrospective studies demonstrating the predictive value used 229 specimens from the
RTOG 9704 trial. This study randomized patients to
gemcitabine or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) after pancreatic surgical resection.10 Patients in both arms received concurrent chemotherapy with 5-FU and radiation. In this
study, hENT-1 expression predicted OS and DFS in pancreatic cancer patients who received gemcitabine but not
in those who received 5-FU.10 Therefore, the conclusion
was made that hENT-1 is a useful predictive but not a
prognostic biomarker.
Collectively, our current findings and the available
data from other studies support that expression of hENT1 is an important biomarker for overall survival in pancreatic cancers. The explanation for the different conclusions
in the previous studies would be due to different reasons.
First, different methods were used to examine the expression of hENT-1 in these 4 studies; more specifically, Ferrell et al and Spratlin et al used immunohistochemistry
performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded pancre-

3132

atic TMA section.8,10 Giovannetti et al9 used RT-PCR
performed on laser-captured malignant cells from either
frozen biopsy or resection specimen with results normalized to a housekeeping gene (GAPDH), and we used RTPCR performed paraffin-embedded tissue with results
normalized to 2 housekeeping genes (HMBS and
RPL13A). Second, the expression results in these studies
were either read as semiquantitatively or quantitatively.
Third, different stages of pancreatic cancer have been
studied. Early stage of pancreatic cancer was used in our
cohort and the Farrell study, whereas in the Giovannetti
study, a mixture of early and late stage of pancreatic cancer
were used, and late-stage pancreatic cancer was used in the
Spratlin study.
As several studies have demonstrated a predictive
value of hENT-1 in gemcitabine sensitivity,8,10 it would
be ideal if we could also examine the association of hENT1 expression with clinical outcome in patients receiving
gemcitabine treatment in our current study. However, we
only had 19 patients who received gemcitabine treatment,
and the small size of this group excluded meaningful
investigation.
The ultimate answer to the question of prognostic
value requires further retrospective studies in patients
with surgically resected pancreatic cancer without adjuvant treatment such as the observation arm used in
randomized clinical trials.21 Recently, 2 studies showed
that, in resected ampullary and gastric cancers, patients
with overexpression of hENT-1 had a shorter OS and a
shorter disease-free survival.22,23 This apparent discrepancy for the prognostic role of hENT-1 observed in these
2 studies may be due to the intrinsic biologic difference
between gastric and ampullary cancer versus pancreatic
cancer.
Another biomarker we studied was RRM1 expression to determine its prognostic value in resected pancreatic cancer. This biomarker has been reported previously
as a potential predictive marker for gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer as well as other tumors such as non-small cell
lung cancer.13,14,24,25 However, the prognostic value of
RRM1 expression in resected pancreatic cancer is unclear.
The study by Giovannetti et al showed no correlation
between RRM1 expression and outcome in pancreatic
cancer, but as stated above this study included both
resected and advanced pancreatic cancer patients.9
In our study, expression of RRM1 by RT-PCR on
paraffin-embedded pancreatic adenocarcinoma appeared
not to be prognostic in the entire cohort independent of
gemcitabine treatment. Our current finding, however, is

in contrast with the results reported by Akita et al that
high expression of RRM1 was associated with better overall survival in resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.14
The study by Akita et al from Japan was very similar to
ours. They evaluated 68 patients with resected pancreatic
cancer, and only 5 patients received gemcitabine as an adjuvant treatment. In multivariate analysis, the RRM1
expression level was the only independent determinant of
overall survival. The apparent discrepancy may be due to
the different methodology used for the determination of
RRM1 expression (immunohistochemistry in their study
vs RT-PCR in our study) or possibly due to genotypic variation, which can be observed between the 2 different ethnic groups.
It would be meaningful to determine the effect of
RRM1 expression on clinical outcome in the patients
treated with gemcitabine in the adjuvant setting. However, our current cohort only has 19 cases, which does not
allow for a meaningful conclusion. In the future, the plan
is to collect more samples of resected pancreatic cancer
patients who received gemcitabine-based treatment to analyze the predictive value of these 2 biomarkers.
There are several limitations in the current study.
First, the tumor used for hENT-1 and RRM1 expression
analysis contained a mixed-cell population including tumor cell, stromal cell, minimal residual pancreatic acinar
cell and Langerhan cell, and a minor component of
inflammatory cells. Although the manually macro-dissected tumor used for RNA extraction contained at least
30% tumor cells (range, 30%-80%), which is higher than
the range of 5% to 55% tumor cells used in other studies
examining gene expression in pancreatic cancer,26 the
presence of other cell types may have influenced the
results in our current study. However, since the stromal
cells (the second most predominant cell type in pancreatic
cancer) and the normal pancreatic parenchyma do not
express hENT-1,8,23 the contribution of other cell types
(for example, Langerhan cells and lymphocytes) to the
total hENT-1 mRNA should have been negligible in our
current study as great caution has been taken to minimize
this problem. Second, the RPA method used to identify
optimal cut-points in hENT-1 or RRM1 expression is very
specific to both the data set and the outcomes being analyzed. Cut-points may be different for OS and PFS, and
the cut-points identified in this study may not be prognostic in other studies.
In summary, to our knowledge, this is the first study
looking at both hENT-1 and RRM1 as a prognostic biomarker in resected pancreatic cancer independent of gem-

citabine therapy. Our current study demonstrated that
low expression of hENT-1 was associated with shorter
overall survival and progression-free survival in surgically
resected pancreatic cancer by quantitatively analyzing
hENT-1 expression using RT-PCR on paraffin-embedded
tissue independent of gemcitabine. However, our study
showed no prognostic value for RRM1 in resected pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately these biomarkers are a long
way from having utility in the clinical setting. More work
needs to be done. There needs to be more data generated
from larger retrospective and prospective studies, which
need to implement standardization of methodologies so
that data can be comparable. Then prospective trials will
need to be done to show the feasibility of a customized
approach. Hopefully in the future these biomarkers will
not only have prognostic value but may hold promise as a
predictive factor to assist in chemotherapy decisions.

CONFLICT OF INTEREST DISCLOSURES
Dr. Wang and Dr. Jiang are employees of Veridex. There are no
potential conflicts of interest for other authors. No funding was
given for this study, but QRT-PCR for hENT-1 and RRM1 was
performed at Veridex.
