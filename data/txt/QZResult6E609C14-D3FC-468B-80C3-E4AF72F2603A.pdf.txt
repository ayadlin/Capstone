Abstract
Estrogen is converted by cytochrome P450 1B1 to 4-hydroxyestradiol (4-OHE2), a putative carcinogenic metabolite of
estrogen. This catechol estrogen metabolite is oxidized further
to produce a reactive quinone via semiquinone. Redox cycling
between 4-OHE2 and its quinoid generates reactive oxygen
species (ROS). ROS not only causes oxidative DNA damage
but also promotes neoplastic transformation of initiated
cells. In the present study, 4-OHE2 induced anchorageindependent colony formation in human mammary epithelial
cells (MCF-10A). MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2 exhibited
increased accumulation of intracellular ROS. The antioxidant
N-acetyl-L-cysteine inhibited the neoplastic transformation
induced by 4-OHE2. ROS overproduced by 4-OHE2 increased
the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-KB (NF-KB) and its
DNA binding through induction of IKB kinase A (IKKA) and
IKKB activities. The inhibition of the IKK activities with Bay
11-7082 significantly reduced the anchorage-independent
growth induced by 4-OHE2. The 4-OHE2–induced activation
of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt resulted in
enhanced IKK activities and phosphorylation of IKBA, thereby
inducing NF-KB activation and anchorage-independent
growth of MCF-10A cells. In conclusion, ROS, concomitantly
overproduced during redox cycling of 4-OHE2, activates IKK
signaling, which may contribute to neoplastic transformation
of MCF-10A cells. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2416–24]

Introduction
There are multiple lines of evidence suggesting estrogen as a
prime risk factor for the development of human breast cancer.
Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the roles
of estrogen in mammary carcinogenesis. One of the welldocumented hypotheses is that estrogen stimulates the transcription of genes encoding proteins involved in cell proliferation
through binding to estrogen receptor a (ERa) and, subsequently,
the estrogen response element. However, it was reported that the
estrogen receptor antagonist ICI-182-780 failed to block the
neoplastic transformation induced by estrogen (1), suggesting
that breast carcinogenesis induced by estrogen is not necessarily

mediated through interaction with the corresponding receptor. It
has been proposed that 6-hydroxyestrogen formed by cytochrome
P450 (CYP)–catalyzed phase I reaction may undergo sulfoconjugation (phase II reaction) at the benzylic C-6 position. The
resultant 6-sulfooxyestrogen is expected to be highly reactive and
would generate electrophilic carbocation capable of attacking
cellular nucleophiles, including DNA (2). The model estrogen
6-sulfate directly interacts with DNA in vitro to produce
miscoding benzylic adducts (3, 4). Another plausible postulation
for ER-independent carcinogenicity of estrogens is based on
oxidative metabolism at the A-ring to form catechol intermediates. In extrahepatic tissues, including breast, CYP 1A1, and CYP
1B1, predominantly metabolize the natural estrogen 17h-estradiol
(E2) to yield 2-hydroxyestradiol (2-OHE2) and 4-hydroxyestradiol
(4-OHE2), respectively.
It has been considered that 4-OHE2 is a more potent carcinogen
than 2-OHE2 (5–7). The former catechol estrogen induces
neoplastic transformation in the human breast epithelial cells (8).
The extent of CYP1B1 expression responsible for the formation
of 4-OHE2, hence, seems to be a critical determinant of the
oxidative metabolism and toxicity of estrogen in mammary cells.
The reactive quinone derived from 4-OHE2 was reported to
produce depurinating DNA adducts, such as 4-OHE2-N 7-guanine
and 4-OHE2-N 3-adenine (9). Notably, the levels of 4-OHE2 and the
protein adducts of its reactive quinone metabolite were detected in
the human breast tumor biopsies at significantly higher levels than
those in the normal breast tissues (10). More recently, the urinary
levels of depurinating DNA adducts derived from 4-OHE2 were
found to be substantially elevated in high-risk women and women
with breast cancer compared with those in the control subjects
(11). However, administration of 4-OHE2 produced tumors in the
kidney of Syrian hamsters (12) and uterus of CD-1 mice (13) rather
than in the mammary gland.
4-OHE2 has been reported to be further oxidized by peroxidases
or CYPs (14). These enzymes oxidize 4-OHE2 first to its semiquinone intermediate and then to the quinone metabolite. 4-OHE2
undergoes redox cycling, during which reactive oxygen species
(ROS) and chemically reactive estrogen semiquinone and quinone
intermediates are produced (15, 16). The overproduced ROS does
not only exert genotoxicity by directly damaging DNA but also
stimulate promotion/progression of mammary tumorigenesis
via the epigenetic mechanisms that often involve activation of
redox-sensitive cellular signaling molecules (17–19).
Nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB), a major redox-sensitive transcription
factor, is responsible for the induction of a wide array of
proinflammatory genes and represents a hallmark of inflammation-associated carcinogenesis. Activation of NF-nB by ROS has been
observed during neoplastic transformation of mammary epithelial
cells (20). Moreover, activation of upstream regulators of NF-nB

4-OHE2–Induced Neoplastic Transformation

activation, such as the InB kinase (IKK) complex, has been reported
to play a critical role in promoting mammary tumorigenesis (21).
In the present study, we examined whether 4-OHE2, at a
noncytotoxic concentration, could produce ROS and activate
IKK–NF-nB signaling, thereby inducing anchorage-independent
growth of human mammary epithelial (MCF-10A) cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. 4-OHE2 and E2 were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. and
dissolved in sterile DMSO to prepare a 20 mmol/L stock solution. The
inhibitors of peroxidases [aminobenzotriazole (ABT)], CYPs (SKF-525A),
NADPH/quinone oxidoreductase (dicoumarol), and extracellular signalregulated kinase (ERK; U0126) were all purchased from Tocris. The
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor (LY294002) was supplied
from Calbiochem. The primary antibodies of proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA), phosphorylated ERK, ERK, and IKKa were purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti–phosphorylated Akt, anti-Akt,
anti–phosphorylated InBa, anti–phosphorylated p65, anti–phosphorylated
IKKh, and anti-IKKh were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.
Antirabbit and antimouse horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibodies were products of Zymed Laboratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit and [g-32P]ATP were purchased from Amersham
Pharmacia Biotech. Dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCF-DA) was obtained
from Molecular Probes, Inc. The oligonucleotides containing the NF-nB
binding sequence and the luciferase assay kit with reporter lysis buffer were
purchased from Promega. Bay 11-7082 was the product of Biomol Research
Laboratories, Inc.
Cell culture. MCF-10A cells were kindly supplied by Dr. Aree Moon
(Duksung Women’s University). The cells were suspended in DMEM/F12
medium supplemented with 10 Ag/mL insulin (bovine), 100 ng/mL cholera
toxin, 0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 20 ng/mL recombinant human epidermal
growth factor, 0.5 Ag/mL fungi zone, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, 100 Ag/mL
penicillin/streptomycin/fungi zone mixture, and 5% heat-inactivated horse
serum and maintained at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere composed
of 5% CO2/95% air.
Anchorage-independent growth assay. To prepare the hard agar layer,
3.3% agarose dissolved in PBS were boiled using a microwave oven and
2.5 mL of the boiled agarose solution were added immediately to 60-mm
dishes using a prewarmed pipette and then kept in the 37jC incubator to
solidify. To prepare the soft agar layer containing the cells, MCF-10A cells
(1  105) were suspended in the 0.33% agarose solution with gentle mixing,
and 2.5 mL of this solution were inoculated on top of the hard agar layer.
After allowing the solution to harden as a soft agar for 4 h, 2.5 mL
of the fresh medium were added to the top of the hardened soft agar layer.
On the next day, these cells were then exposed either to DMSO, 4-OHE2,
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), and Bay 11-7082, separately or in combination,
once in 3 d for 3 wk. After 3 to 4 wk of incubation, anchorage-independent
growth (spherical formation containing >10 cells) was scored using a light
microscope. The total number of growth foci per 1  105 cells in a well was
counted. The experiments were replicated four times, and a representative
set of data is photographed for presentation.
Western blot analysis. After treatment with 4-OHE2, cells were washed
with PBS and then lysed at 4jC for 30 min in the lysis buffer [150 mmol/L
NaCl, 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 25 mmol/L NaF, 20 mmol/L EGTA,
0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L DTT, and 1 mmol/L Na3VO4 with protease
inhibitor cocktail tablet]. Nuclei and unlysed cellular debris were removed
by centrifugation at 14,000  g for 15 min at 4jC. Protein samples
were separated on SDS PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred
to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane at 300 mA for 4 h. The blots
were prepared and visualized according to the procedure described
previously (22).
Measurement of intracellular ROS accumulation. To monitor the
accumulation of intracellular ROS, the fluorescent probe DCF-DA was used.
After treatment with 4-OHE2, cells were rinsed with Kreb’s ringer solution
and treated with 10 Amol/L DCF-DA. After a 30-min incubation at 37jC in

www.aacrjournals.org

the presence of DCF-DA, cells were examined under a confocal microscope
equipped with an argon laser (488 nm, 200 mW).
Wound migration assay. 4-OHE2–induced cell migration was measured by using the Culture-Inserts (Ibidi). The Culture-Inserts were
transferred to six-well plates, and MCF-10A cells were seeded at a density
of 7  104/mL in each well of Culture-Inserts. After a 24-h incubation, the
Culture-Inserts were removed, and 500 Am cell-free gap were created. The
dish containing these cells were then treated with the medium containing
4-OHE2 (20 Amol/L) alone or together with Bay 11-7082 and incubated at
37jC. Phase contrast images of the closed gap were captured at
0 h (control) and 24 h of incubation using an inverted microscope
(magnification, 10).
Nuclear protein extraction and electrophoretic mobility gel shift
assay. After treatment with 4-OHE2, cells were washed with PBS,
centrifuged, and suspended in the ice-cold isotonic buffer A [a plasma
membrane lysis buffer containing 10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.9), 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, 10 mmol/L KCl, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, and 0.2 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF)]. After incubation on ice for 10 min, the
lysate was centrifuged and the resulting pellets were resuspended in icecold buffer C [a nuclear membrane lysis buffer containing 20 mmol/L
HEPES (pH 7.9), 20% glycerol, 420 mmol/L NaCl, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.2 mmol/L EDTA, 0.5 mmol/L DTT, and 0.2 mmol/L PMSF] and incubated
for 20 min on ice. After a vigorous vortex mixing, the lysed nuclear fraction
was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected and stored at 70jC.
The DNA binding activity of NF-nB was measured by electrophoretic
mobility gel shift assay (EMSA), as described previously (22).
Transient transfection and the luciferase reporter assay. MCF-10A
cells were seeded at a density of 2  105 per well in a six-well dish and
grown to 60% to 70% confluence in the complete growth medium. The
cells in each well were cotransfected with 2 Ag of luciferase reporter
plasmid construct harboring the NF-nB binding site (pGL2–NF-nB) and
0.5 Ag of control vector pCMV–h-galactosidase using WelFect-M GOLD
transfection reagent (WelGENE), and the cotransfection was carried
out according to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer. After an
18-h transfection, the medium was changed and the cells were further
treated with 4-OHE2 for 2 h. The cells were then washed with PBS
and lysed in 1 reporter lysis buffer (Promega). The lysed cell extract
(20 AL) was mixed with 100 AL of the luciferase assay reagent, and the
luciferase activity was determined using a luminometer (AutoLumat LB
953, EG&G Berthold). The h-galactosidase activity was measured to
normalize the luciferase activity.
Immunofluorescence staining. MCF-10A cells were placed on four-well
chamber slides and treated with 4-OHE2 for 2 h. Cells were rinsed rapidly with
PBS and then fixed for 30 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde.
After washing the fixed cells with PBS, they were incubated further for 2 h at
room temperature in blocking buffer composed of PBS containing 10%
bovine serum albumin and 0.5% Tween 20. The nuclear translocation of
PCNA and phosphorylated p65 were visualized using a rabbit polyclonal
antibody. The PCNA and phosphorylated p65 antibodies were added after
1:100 dilution with the blocking buffer, and cells were incubated overnight at
4jC. Afterwards, the incubated cells were washed with PBS and then labeled
with diluted (1:1,000) FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Zymed
Laboratories) and incubated for additional 1 h at room temperature. Cells
were then rinsed with PBS and stained with propidium iodide for 10 min.
After washing with PBS, cells were analyzed under a confocal microscope and
photographed (Leica Microsystems Heidelberg GmbH).
In vitro IKK activity assay (radioactive). The in vitro IKK activity assay
was conducted after a slight modification from the protocol described by
Bharti and colleagues (23). Briefly, the lysed cell extract (200 Ag) was
precleared using normal mouse IgG and protein G agarose beads and
subjected to immunoprecipitation by using anti-IKKa or anti-IKKh
antibody. The resulting immunocomplex was pulled down by mixing
with protein G agarose beads. The immunoprecipitate thus obtained
was suspended in 50 AL of THE reaction mixture containing 47 AL of
1 kinase buffer [25 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmol/L glycerolphosphate,
2 mmol/L DTT, 0.1 mmol/L Na3VO4, and 10 mmol/L MgCl2], 1 Ag glutathione
S-transferase (GST)–InBa (1–317) substrate protein, and 10 ACi [g-32P]ATP.

Results
4-OHE2 induces neoplastic transformation and proliferation
of MCF-10A cells. To clarify the role of 4-OHE2 in mammary
carcinogenesis, we examined the induction of anchorage-independent growth of human breast epithelial MCF-10A cells treated
with this catechol estrogen. As in Fig. 1A, MCF-10A cells exposed
to 4-OHE2 (20 Amol/L) twice a week for 3 weeks exhibited
significantly increased anchorage-independent growth when compared with the vehicle-treated cells. We noted that both the size
and the number of foci in the 4-OHE2 (20 Amol/L)–treated cells
were increased markedly compared with the same concentration of
E2 treatment, and a 2 Amol/L concentration of 4-OHE2 had the
same transforming activity as 20 Amol/L E2 (Fig. 1B). Furthermore,
there was elevated expression of PCNA, a biochemical hallmark of
cell proliferation, in the MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2

(Fig. 1C). Immunocytochemical staining verified the pronounced
accumulation of PCNA in the nucleus of MCF-10A cells after 4OHE2 treatment (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that
4-OHE2 can induce neoplastic transformation and stimulate
proliferation of MCF-10A cells.
4-OHE2 induces overproduction of ROS in MCF-10A cells.
The exposure of MCF-10A cells with 4-OHE2 (20 Amol/L) followed
by DCF-DA fluorescence staining gave rise to time-dependent
increases in fluorescence intensity (Fig. 2A), indicative of induced
intracellular accumulation of ROS. The 4-OHE2–induced ROS
production was abolished by coincubation with the prototypic
antioxidant NAC (Fig. 2B). To further investigate whether the
neoplastic transformation induced by 4-OHE2 is associated with
such generation of ROS, the effects of NAC on 4-OHE2-induced
anchorage-independent growth of MCF-10A cells were examined
by using the soft agar assay. Interestingly, the cells treated with
4-OHE2, together with NAC, exhibited a significantly lower colonyforming efficiency than those treated with 4-OHE2 alone (Fig. 2C).
These findings suggest that overproduction of ROS is responsible
for increased formation of anchorage-independent foci in the
MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2.
Overproduction of ROS induced by 4-OHE2 contributes to
NF-KB activation via the IKK signaling. NF-nB, a redox-sensitive
transcription factor, has been known to be activated by ROS. Thus,
we attempted to examine NF-nB activation in MCF-10A cells by
measuring the NF-nB DNA binding at various time intervals after
4-OHE2 stimulation. Figure 3A displays the significantly enhanced
NF-nB DNA binding activity, which was sustained up to 6 h in cells
exposed to 4-OHE2. Consistent with increased DNA binding of
NF-nB, its transcriptional activity was enhanced in the 4-OHE2–
treated MCF-10A cells, as measured by use of plasmid containing
the consensus NF-nB binding DNA oligonucleotides linked to a

luciferase reporter gene (pGL2–NF-nB; Fig. 3B). As revealed by the
immunocytochemistry, 4-OHE2 also induced translocation of the
phosphorylated form of p65, one of the functionally active subunits
of NF-nB, into the nucleus (Fig. 3C). The nuclear translocation of
phosphorylated p65 was abolished when cells were treated with
excess amounts of complementary phosphorylated p65 peptide
(Fig. 3C).
IKKa and IKKh are the upstream kinases known to be involved
in the phosphorylation of InBa, which precedes proteasomal
degradation through ubiquitination in various cultured cell lines
(24). The in vitro radioactive kinase assays conducted with wholecell extracts obtained at different time points after treatment with
4-OHE2 revealed the increased kinase activities of both IKKa and
IKKh (Fig. 3D). The 4-OHE2–induced stimulation of NF-nB DNA
binding activity was abolished by NAC treatment (Fig. 3E).

Taken together, these results indicate that the overproduction of
ROS induced by 4-OHE2 can stimulate the NF-nB DNA binding in
MCF-10A cells via the IKKa/IKKh signaling.
Activation of the IKKA/IKKB complex induced by 4-OHE2
enhances neoplastic transformation. To verify the functional
role of IKKs in the NF-nB activation causing anchorage-independent growth of MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2, we used an
inhibitor of IKK activity. Cotreatment of MCF-10A cells with
increasing doses of Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IKK, resulted in a
dose-dependent suppression of phosphorylation of InBa, as well as
the catalytic activity of both IKKa and IKKh (Fig. 4A), and
abolished the NF-nB DNA binding triggered by 4-OHE2 (Fig. 4B).
The inhibition of IKK activity also abrogated the colony formation
induced by 4-OHE2 (Fig. 4C). In addition to blocking the colony
formation induced by 4-OHE2, Bay 11-7082 suppressed migration of
MCF-10A cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 4D). These results
suggest that activation of the IKK–NF-nB signaling pathway by the
overproduced ROS contributes to the neoplastic transformation of
MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2.
Overproduction of ROS induced by 4-OHE2 causes increased
phosphorylation of ERK and Akt, which leads to the activation
of IKK and NF-KB. To further explore the signaling events leading
to NF-nB activation and neoplastic transformation in MCF-10A
cells treated with 4-OHE2, we examined whether phosphorylation
of upstream kinases involved in the activation of the IKK complex
is increased by ROS. MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2 showed
rapid phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 5A), whereas the phosphorylation of other mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) was
less prominent (data not shown). As Akt is also known to be
involved in tumorigenesis, such as cell proliferation, angiogenesis,
invasion, and metastasis, activation of this upstream kinase in
MCF-10A cells treated with 4-OHE2 was also assessed. The
phosphorylation of Akt was evident 1 h after stimulation with
4-OHE2 (Fig. 5A).
We noted that U0126 [MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK)–ERK inhibitor]
and LY294002 (PI3K-Akt inhibitor) attenuated the DNA binding
(Fig. 5B) and the transcriptional activity of NF-nB (Fig. 5C),
suggesting that 4-OHE2–induced activation of NF-nB is attributed,
at least in part, to the activation of both ERK and Akt via
phosphorylation. The association between increased phosphorylation of ERK and Akt and NF-nB activation was corroborated by
reduced NF-nB DNA binding after transient transfection with
dominant-negative mutant of ERK1/2 or the kinase-dead mutant
form of Akt (Fig. 5D). In addition, both U0126 and LY294002
inhibited the catalytic activity of IKKa and IKKh induced by
4-OHE2 (Fig. 5E). The phosphorylation of InBa and IKKa/IKKh
induced by 4-OHE2 was also attenuated by both inhibitors (Fig. 5E).
NAC suppressed not only catalytic activities of both IKKa and
IKKh but also their phosphorylation induced by 4-OHE 2
(Fig. 5E). NAC treatment caused a decrease in the 4-OHE2–induced
phosphorylation of ERK and Akt as well (Fig. 5F). Based on these
observations, it is likely that ROS formed during the redox cyling of
4-OHE2 may induce phosphorylation of ERK and Akt and,
subsequently, IKK activity.
Oxidation of 4-OHE2 causes inhibition of NAD(P)H:quinone
oxidoreductase 1 activity, overproduction of ROS, and
increased NF-KB DNA binding. Oxidation of E2 to 4-OHE2 in
extrahepatic tissues is catalyzed mainly by CYP1B1 and, to some
extent, by CYP3A (25). The precise mechanism underlying the
oxidation of 4-OHE2 to its semiquinone and quinone metabolites,
as well as their redox cycling with concomitant generation of ROS,

has not been defined in detail. To examine whether oxidation of
4-OHE2 by peroxidases or CYPs is involved in generation of
ROS, MCF10A cells were treated with a peroxidase inhibitor ABT
(25 Amol/L) or a pan-CYP inhibitor SKF-525A (25 Amol/L) in the
presence of 4-OHE2. As shown in Fig. 6A (top), the overproduction
of ROS induced by 4-OHE2 was abolished by cotreatment with each
of these inhibitors, indicative of potential roles of peroxidases and/
or CYPs in ROS generation through metabolic oxidation of 4-OHE2.
SKF-525A was more effective than ABT at inhibiting the formation
of ROS. In an attempt to examine whether the reactive quinoids
arising from 4-OHE2 oxidation contribute to the overproduction of
ROS, the cells exposed to 4-OHE2 were further treated with a wellknown inhibitor of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO)
activity, dicoumarol. As shown in Fig. 6A (bottom), the level of
ROS produced was markedly increased in those cells exposed to
4-OHE2 and dicoumarol together.
In parallel with the inhibition of the 4-OHE2–derived ROS
overproduction, the inhibitors of peroxidase (ABT) and CYP
(SKF-525A) also reduced the 4-OHE2–mediated increase of NF-nB

DNA binding activity (Fig. 6B, left). Conversely, dicoumarol, the
inhibitor of NQO activity, markedly enhanced the NF-nB DNA
binding in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6B, right). Based on
these findings, oxidation of 4-OHE2 by peroxidase or CYPs leads to
activation of NF-nB, as well as generation of ROS in MCF-10A cells.

Discussion
Because estrogens represent a major risk factor for breast
cancer, numerous laboratories have made a considerable effort to
dissect the molecular pathways leading to estrogen-induced
breast carcinogenesis. It has been proposed that genotoxicity
induced by estrogen metabolites, including 4-OHE2, may contribute to breast carcinogenesis (26). Human breast tumors exhibit
considerably high levels of 4-OHE2 (27). However, when given to
experimental animals, this catechol estrogen has been shown to
produce tumors at tissues/organs other than mammary gland.
Thus, 4-OHE2 has been shown to induce kidney tumors in Syrian
hamsters (12) and uterine adenocarcinoma in CD-1 mice (13).

4-OHE2 readily undergoes oxidation to estradiol-3,4-quinone
that can react with DNA to form depurinating adducts (11, 28).
Therefore, estradiol-3,4-quinone may be an endogenous tumor
initiator of breast cancer and other human malignancies (29).
Estradiol-3,4-quinone forms 4-OHE2-1-N 3Ade and 4-OHE2-1N 7Gua adducts in mouse skin (30) or rat mammary gland (31).
The higher urinary levels of depurinating adducts derived from
4-hydroxylated metabolite of estradiol in high-risk women and
women with breast cancer than in control subjects (11) provide
additional evidence for the implication of catechol estrogens,
especially 4-OHE2, in human mammary carcinogenesis. However,
El-Bayoumy and colleagues (32) reported that cholesterol
epoxides and estrone-3,-4-quinone lack tumorigenic activity in
the rat mammary gland. Treatment of pellets containing 2-OHE2,
4-OHE2, 16a-OHE2, or 4-OHE1 failed to induce any significant
mammary tumorigenesis compared with E2 in the ACI rats (33).
Therefore, the direct involvement of 4-OHE2 or other metabolites
of E2 in the mammary carcinogenesis remains controversial.
4-OHE2 and estradiol-3,4-quinone have been shown to be
mutagenic in both in vivo and in vitro systems (29). However,
genotoxicity is not enough to complete the carcinogenic process.
The oxidized quinone metabolite of 4-OHE2 can be reduced
back to 4-OHE2 either directly by one-step two-electron reduction

www.aacrjournals.org

catalyzed by NQO or by two-step sequential one-electron
reduction catalyzed by CYP reductase. Whereas the NQO-catalyzed
reduction does not generate semiquinone intermediate, the CYP
reductase–catalyzed reduction can. In aerobic cells, semiquinone
can be oxidized back to quinone by donating one electron to
molecular oxygen (O2), thus producing superoxide anion (O2 ).
Alternatively, the semiquinone is reduced further to 4-OHE2
by abstracting one electron from reduced glutathione (GSH) or
other -SH containing proteins generating respective adducts. When
the cellular GSH level is low or depleted, the semiquinone will react
more with the -SH containing enzymes such as NQO and inhibit
the enzyme activity. Such suicidal inhibition of NQO activity by the
semiquinone would drive greater proportion of quinone to undergo
the one-electron reduction redox cycling pathway and cause
overproduction of O2 and other ROS (15).
ROS formed as a consequence of redox cycling of 4-OHE2
may play an important role in the transformation of MCF-10A
cells. We observed that transformation of MCF-10A cells treated
with 4-OHE2 was inhibited by NAC, lending support to the above
notion. In another study, addition of noncytotoxic concentration
(20 Amol/L) of hydrogen peroxide to the medium caused
anchorage-independent growth in MCF-10A cells (see Supplementary Data 1). These findings, taken together, suggest that ROS

generated through the redox cycling of 4-OHE2 can contribute to
transformation of MCF-10A cells.
Multiple lines of compelling evidence support that endogenous
redox stress is likely to be responsible for the activation of NF-nB
(34, 35). The activation of NF-nB is mediated via modulation of the
activities of the upstream IKK complex (36, 37). IKKa plays an
essential role in the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-nB on
serine 536, whereas IKKh is capable of phosphorylating both InBa
and p65 (37, 38). There is an accumulating body of data supporting
the importance of the role of NF-nB in breast carcinogenesis.
Increased IKK activities have been observed in several human
mammary cancer cell lines and also in breast cancer specimens
(39). A dominant-negative mutation of IKKh in mouse mammary
tumor cells inhibited NF-nB activation and attenuated tumorigenic
potential of cells (40). In a recent study by Singh and colleagues,
NF-nB activation was found to be increased in ER( ) compared
with ER(+) tumors and was predominantly up-regulated in ER( )/
HER-2/neu(+) tumors (41). Moreover, activation of NF-nB was
reported to be associated with poor clinical outcome in ER(+) breast

tumors (42). We observed that 4-OHE2–induced IKKh activation
was attenuated by NAC. Moreover, ablation of ROS production by
inhibiting the activities of peroxidase or CYP attenuated NF-nB
activation. Based on these results, we conclude that ROS overproduced from the oxidative metabolism of 4-OHE2 can trigger
activation of NF-nB via the IKK signaling. A pharmacologic inhibitor
of IKK activity, Bay 11-7082, blunted NF-nB activation and also
inhibited the 4-OHE2-induced neoplastic transformation in MCF10A cells. Several upstream signaling pathways are involved in
activation of NF-nB. It has been reported that some kinases, like
ERK1/2 and Akt, modulate the IKK activities via phosphorylation,
thereby facilitating degradation of InB required for the functional
activation of NF-nB (22, 43, 44). This notion was verified in our
present study.
One of the major target molecules subjected to NF-nB–driven
transactivation is cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Induction of COX-2
expression has been causatively linked to promotion of cell
transformation and tumor growth. Inappropriate up-regulation of
COX-2 has been frequently observed in breast tumor, which

MCF-10A cells exposed to 20 Amol/L 4-OHE2.
Concentrations of the MEK-ERK inhibitor (U0126)
and the PI3K-Akt inhibitor (LY294002) were
20 Amol/L and 25 Amol/L, respectively. D, MCF-10A
cells were transfected with pCE4 basic vector
(MOCK), dominant-negative ERK (DN-ERK),
full-length AKT (WT-AKT), or kinase-dead AKT (KD
ART) with K179M mutation. Transfected cells were
treated with vehicle or 4-OHE2 (20 Amol/L) for 3 h,
and the nuclear extracts were prepared for the
NF-nB DNA binding assay by EMSA. E, whole
extracts were obtained from MCF-10A cells treated
with 4-OHE2 (20 Amol/L) for 2.5 h in the presence or
absence of NAC (3 mmol/L), U0126 (20 Amol/L),
or LY294002 (25 Amol/L). Cell extracts were
immunoprecipitated with anti-IKKa or anti-IKKh
polyclonal antibody before measuring the
phosphorylation of GST-InBa as a substrate. The
phosphorylated products were resolved in 10%
SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by
autoradiography. The effects of NAC, U0126, and

4-OHE2–Induced Neoplastic Transformation

Figure 6. CYPs and quinone reductase are involved
in 4-OHE2–induced ROS generation and NF-nB
activation. A, ROS levels in the 4-OHE2–treated
MCF-10A cells were measured by FACS analysis
after staining with the fluorescent probe DCF in the
absence or presence of the CYP inhibitor SKF-525A
(25 Amol/L), the peroxidase inhibitor ABT (25 Amol/L),
or the quinone reductase inhibitor dicoumarol (100 or
150 Amol/L). The shift to the left of the curve due to a
decrease in fluorescence indicates the reduced
intracellular levels of ROS, and the shift to the right is
indicative of increased intracellular ROS accumulation.

correlates with increased angiogenesis and metastatic potential in
breast cancer cells (45, 46). COX-2 overexpression is observed in
f40% of breast tumors (46). Numerous reports indicate that
activation of NF-nB largely accounts for COX-2 up-regulation in
both transgenic mice overexpressing p100/p52 (47) and immortalized human mammary epithelial cells (48). We noted that COX-2
expression was induced significantly after stimulation with 4-OHE2,
which was attenuated by pharmacologic inhibition of NF-nB, as
well as ERK and Akt (Supplementary Data 2).
In summary, 4-OHE2 overproduces ROS as a consequence of
redox cycling catalyzed by CYP or peroxidase, which may then
activate ERK and Akt signaling and subsequently stimulate IKK–
NF-nB signaling (see the proposed scheme in Supplementary Data
3). Through this sequence of events initiated by 4-OHE2, the
expression of COX-2 is up-regulated and may result in activated
aromatase and enhanced expression of HER-2/neu in MCF-10A
cells. All of these findings suggest that ROS accumulation as a
consequence of oxidation of 4-OHE2 and activation of ROS-

www.aacrjournals.org

mediated signaling pathways represented by the IKK–NF-nB–COX2 axis are responsible for the transformation of MCF-10A cells
and, therefore, could be implicated in breast carcinogenesis.
Additional studies will be necessary to clarify how COX-2
up-regulation could stimulate the neoplastic transformation of
MCF-10A cells.
