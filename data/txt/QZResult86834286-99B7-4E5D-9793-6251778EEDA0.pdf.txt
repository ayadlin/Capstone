Abstract
We have shown previously the oncolytic potential of myxoma
virus in a murine xenograft model of human glioma. Here, we
show that myxoma virus used alone or in combination with
rapamycin is effective and safe when used in experimental
models of medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo. Nine of 10
medulloblastoma cell lines tested were susceptible to lethal
myxoma virus infection, and pretreatment of cells with
rapamycin increased the extent of in vitro oncolysis. Intratumoral injection of live myxoma virus when compared with
control inactivated virus prolonged survival in D341 and Daoy
orthotopic human medulloblastoma xenograft mouse models
[D341 median survival: 21 versus 12.5 days; P = 0.0008; Daoy
median survival: not reached (three of five mice apparently
‘‘cured’’ after 223 days) versus 75 days; P = 0.0021]. Rapamycin
increased the extent of viral oncolysis, ‘‘curing’’ most Daoy
tumor-bearing mice and reducing or eliminating spinal cord
and ventricle metastases. Rapamycin enhanced tumor-specific
myxoma virus replication in vivo and prolonged survival of
D341 tumor-bearing mice (median survival of mice treated
with live virus (LV) and rapamycin, versus LV alone, versus
rapamycin alone, versus inactivated virus: 25 days versus 19,
13, and 11 days, respectively; P < 0.0001). Rapamycin increased
the levels of constitutively activated Akt in Daoy and D341
cells, which may explain its ability to enhance myxoma virus
oncolysis. These observations suggest that myxoma virus may
be an effective oncolytic agent against medulloblastoma and
that combination therapy with signaling inhibitors that
modulate activity of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt
pathway will further enhance the oncolytic potential of
myxoma virus. [Cancer Res 2007;67(18):8818–27]

Introduction
Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in
children. It is difficult to treat because tumor cells invade the
surrounding normal tissue and disseminate through the cerebral
spinal fluid, leading to metastasis throughout the cerebral spinal

axis. Intensive multimodality treatment that combines surgery,
craniospinal irradiation, and multiple drug chemotherapy can
achieve long-term survival rates of 50% to 70%, but at significant
cost due to toxic side effects (1–3). Most medulloblastoma survivors suffer long-term treatment-related morbidity that greatly
affects their quality of life (1, 2). New therapeutic approaches with
superior efficacy and reduced toxicity are urgently needed in the
clinical management of children with medulloblastoma (3, 4).
Oncolytic viruses are able to selectively infect and kill tumor cells
by exploiting the same cellular defects that promote tumor growth
( for review, see ref. 5). For example, many tumor cells acquire
mutations that allow them to escape IFN-mediated signaling
pathways that regulate proliferation and apoptosis, but defects in
IFN signaling also cripple the innate antiviral response of tumor
cell. Tumor cells often have defects in translational control or in
other signaling pathways, such as those involving Myc, Ras, Akt,
and p53, which render them susceptible to lethal viral infections.
An expanding number of oncolytic viruses have shown promising
results in experimental brain tumor models, and a few have been
tested in clinical trials with modest success (5–10). Two studies
examined the efficacy of oncolytic virotherapy in medulloblastoma.
A mutant adenovirus, Delta-24, was shown to infect and kill human
medulloblastoma cell lines in culture (11). We also showed that
reovirus was able to kill human medulloblastoma cell lines and
tumor specimens in vitro and that intratumoral (i.t.) injection of
reovirus in an orthotopic mouse model of human medulloblastoma
significantly prolonged survival and reduced the frequency of
metastases (12). These results are encouraging and suggest that
one or more oncolytic viruses might prove to be effective novel
therapies against medulloblastoma.
Ideally, an oncolytic virus should be able to selectively infect and
kill tumor cells while sparing normal nontransformed cells. Other
desirable properties of oncolytic viruses include the ability to
engineer the virus (to increase efficacy and selectivity) and a
nonpathogenic profile in humans. Myxoma virus is a rabbit-specific
poxvirus that is considered a promising oncolytic virus platform.
Its tropism is normally highly restricted to European rabbits, and it
is nonpathogenic for all other vertebrate species tested, including
humans (13). Despite this narrow specificity, myxoma virus is
capable of infecting and killing a wide variety of human tumor
cell lines (7, 14). We have shown the safety and oncolytic potential
of myxoma virus in a murine xenograft model of human malignant
glioma (7). Myxoma virus is amenable to genetic engineering
because its large dsDNA genome is fully sequenced (15) and can
accommodate a large amount of foreign gene material (16, 17).
Although we do not have a complete understanding of all the

Myxoma Virus Oncolysis of Medulloblastoma

underlying signaling defects that cause tumor cells to become
susceptible to myxoma virus, we have found that high endogenous
levels of phosphorylated Akt in human cancer cells indicate
susceptibility to myxoma virus infection and that constitutively
activation of Akt is required for productive myxoma virus infection
(18). Indeed, the M-T5 gene product from MV acts as a functional
homologue of PIKE-A, a cellular activator of Akt (19).
The molecular pathogenesis of medulloblastoma is only partially
understood, but aberrant signaling through several different
pathways is involved, including pathways that lead to activation
of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and its downstream
effector Akt (3, 20, 21). The frequency of Sonic hedgehog (Shh)–
induced medulloblastoma in mice is significantly increased by
activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway (22). Evidence of
phosphorylated Akt and PTEN mutations in human medulloblastoma samples suggests that constitutive activation of the PI3K/Akt
pathway is an important step in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis
(21). Overexpression of several different growth factor receptors,
including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor, also
contributes to medulloblastoma tumorigenesis, in part by activating PI3K (23). The serine/threonine kinase mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) is one important downstream target of Akt.
Upon activation, mTOR acts as a central modulator of cell
proliferation in medulloblastoma (23, 24). Therefore, modulation
of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a potential therapeutic
strategy against medulloblastoma.
Inhibitors of mTOR, such as rapamycin, RAD001, and CCI-779,
have been evaluated as novel agents for brain tumor therapy
(25–30). However, rapamycin alone produces only partial responses
in medulloblastoma (26) and some brain tumor cell lines are resistant
to rapamycin (27, 28). CCI-779 had only limited antitumor activity as
a single agent against recurrent glioblastomas in phase II studies
(29, 30). Some studies have shown increased efficacy when oncolytic
viruses were used in combination with chemotherapy drugs (31, 32).
Pretreatment with rapamycin increased levels of activated Akt
as well as myxoma virus tropism and spread in vitro in human
tumor cell lines that are ordinarily nonpermissive (33). It is possible
that combination therapy using mTOR inhibitors and oncolytic
viruses could be more effective than using either agent alone.
Here, we evaluated the potential of myxoma virus as an oncolytic
agent against medulloblastoma in vitro and in vivo in orthotopic
human medulloblastoma mouse models. The potential therapeutic
synergism of combined treatment with myxoma virus and
rapamycin was also investigated using both in vitro and in vivo
approaches.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. Murine NIH3T3 fibroblasts and the human medulloblastoma
cell lines Daoy, UW228, TE671, D283, and D341 were obtained from the
American Type Culture Collection. Human medulloblastoma lines D425 and
D384 were supplied by Dr. Darrell Bigner (Duke University, Durham, NC).
Two murine medulloblastoma cell lines, Ptc850 and Ptc1102, were derived
from spontaneous medulloblastoma arising in Ptc1+/ mice (34, 35). ONS76
cells were obtained from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka Animal
Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan). Cells were grown in DMEM/F12 containing
10% (Daoy, UW228, TE671, NIH3T3, Ptc850, and Ptc1102) or 20% (D341,
D384, D283, and D425) fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37jC in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator. Each cell line was tested routinely for Mycoplasma
contamination.
Viruses. Two derivatives of myxoma virus (strain Lausanne), created by
intergenic insertion of a marker cassette, were used for infection studies:

www.aacrjournals.org

vMyxgfp, which contains a green fluorescent protein (GFP) cassette driven
by a synthetic vaccinia virus early/late promoter, and vMyxlac, which
contains a h-galactosidase cassette driven by a late MV promoter. Both
viruses were propagated and titrated by focus formation on BGMK cells as
described previously (36). UV-inactivated (‘‘dead’’) myxoma virus (DV) was
prepared by irradiating virus with UV light for 2 h.
Cell infection in vitro. Cells were seeded to 70% to 80% confluence in
96-well plates before treatment with virus and/or rapamycin (LC Laboratories). Control cells included cells that were not exposed to virus or
rapamycin, as well as separate samples treated with DV. Cells were
incubated at 37jC for 1 h in 50AL of serum-free medium containing the
indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of live or UV-inactivated myxoma
virus, after which 150 AL of fresh medium were added to each well and cells
were cultured until needed for further analysis. For the combined therapy
group, rapamycin was added to the cells 1 h before treatment with virus.
Phase-contrast and fluorescent images of cells were taken using a Carl Zeiss
inverted microscope (Axiovert 200M) mounted with Carl Zeiss digital
camera (AxioCam Mrc).
Transfection of medulloblastoma cells with GFP. Daoy cells were
transfected with the GFP expression plasmid using Fugene transfection
reagent (Roche Diagnostic Co.). A mixture of Fugene and plasmid DNA was
incubated for 30 min at room temperature in serum-free culture medium.
The DNA mixture was applied to Daoy cells for 4 h at 37jC in serum-free
medium and then FBS was added to a final concentration of 10%. Cells were
cultured for 4 days and the culture medium was changed daily. After 4 days,
transfected cells were selected using G418 antibiotic (200 Ag/mL), and
transfected clones were identified by fluorescent microscopy to detect GFP
expression. GFP expression was detected in >95% of the cells, as determined
by flow cytometry.
In vitro analysis of cytopathic effect and viral infection. Cells were
seeded at 5  104 cells per well in six-well plates and cultured overnight.
After infection with vMyxgfp, vMyxlac, or DV at a MOI of 5 for 48 h, cells
were imaged under phase contrast and by immunofluorescence. vMyxlacinfected cells were stained with X-gal to detect h-galactosidase activity.
Cells were washed with PBS, fixed for 10 min in acetone, incubated for 4 to
8 h at room temperature with X-gal staining solution (100 Ag/mL X-gal,
500 Amol/L potassium ferrocyanide, and 200 Amol/L MgCI2 in PBS), and
then photographed under phase contrast.
Cell viability assays. Cells grown to 70% confluence were infected with
different doses (MOI of 0, 1, and 10) of vMyxgfp in the presence or absence
of rapamycin (20 or 100 nmol/L). Cell viability was measured 72 h after
infection using the 4-[3-(4-iodophenyl)-2-(4-nitrophenyl)-2H-5-tetrazolio]1,3-benzene disulfonate (WST-1) assay as described (37).
Immunohistochemistry for viral protein expression. Frozen sections
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, followed by three washes
with PBS. The sections were exposed to the primary antibody (M-T7; rabbit
polyclonal anti-myxoma serum diluted 1:2,000 in PBS containing 2% bovine
serum albumin; refs. 7, 38) for 12 to 16 h at 4jC. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG
(Vector Laboratories) was used as a secondary antibody and the ABC
Immunohistochemistry kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for immunostaining.
Western blotting. Cells were infected with 5 MOI of vMyxgfp with or
without rapamycin (20 nmol/L) as described above. Forty-eight hours later,
cells were washed with PBS and lysed. Protein concentrations of cell lysates
were measured using the bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Biolynx, Inc.).
Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were probed with antibodies recognizing the
viral proteins M-T7 and Serp-1 (7, 38), phosphorylated and total Akt (Cell
Signaling Technology), and phosphorylated and total 70-kDa ribosomal
protein S6 kinase (p70S6K; Cell Signaling Technology). Immunoreactive
proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Blots were probed
with an anti–h-actin antibody (Sigma) to confirm equal protein loading.
Virus recovery assay. Medulloblastoma cell lines were seeded at density
of 5  104 cells per well in six-well plates. Twenty hours later, cells were
treated with vMyxgfp alone [MOI of 0.1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) per cell]
or with vMyxgfp and 20 nmol/L rapamycin in serum-free medium for 1 h at
37jC. Virus-containing medium was removed, replaced with fresh medium,

and cells were cultured until the designated time points. Plates were then
subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing to release intracellular
viral particles. Serial dilutions of supernatants and cell lysates were cultured
on confluent layers of BGMK cells and viral titers were determined by
counting fluorescent viral foci 48 h later. All samples were tested and
experiments were replicated in triplicate.
Animals. CD-1 nude mice ( female, 6–8 weeks old) were purchased from
Charles River Canada. The animals were housed in groups of three to five in
a vivarium maintained on a 12-hour light/dark schedule with a temperature
of 22 F 1jC and a relative humidity of 50 F 5%. Food and water were
available ad libitum. All procedures were reviewed and approved by the
University of Calgary Animal Care Committee.
In vivo studies in CD-1 nude mice bearing Daoy medulloblastoma
tumors. An orthotopic animal model was established with the human
medulloblastoma cell line Daoy. The stereotactic techniques used to
implant medulloblastoma cells (1  105 cells per mouse) in the cerebellum
have been described previously (7, 37). Twelve or 25 days later, an i.t. injection of 5  106 PFUs of live vMyxgfp or DV in 2 AL PBS was administered
stereotactically over 10 to 20 s. The ‘‘late-stage’’ model (with treatment
beginning after 25 days) was injected every other day for a total of three
injections. Animals losing 20% or more of their body weight or having
trouble ambulating, feeding, or grooming were sacrificed. Animals were
anesthetized, perfused intracardially with PBS, and then fixed using 4%
paraformaldehyde. Brains and major organs were examined histologically.
To test the effect of combination therapy using myxoma virus and
rapamycin, tumor-bearing animals were divided into the following four
treatment groups (nine animals per group) 11 days after implantation of
Daoy-GFP cells: (a) DV control, (b) rapamycin (5 mg/kg, five times weekly
for a total of 2 weeks), (c) vMyxgfp (5  106 PFUs/mouse/injection, every
other day for a total of three injections), and (d) vMyxgfp and rapamycin.
Rapamycin was administered i.p. beginning 11 days after tumor implantation, whereas vMyxgfp injections began after 12 days. To assess metastasis, three animals from each group were sacrificed 30 days after the last
virus injection. The brain and spinal cord were removed, photographed
using a fluorescent stereotactic microscope to count GFP-expressing
metastases, and then completely serially sectioned and examined by fluorescent microscopy. The remaining six animals in each group were used to
assess survival.
In vivo studies in CD-1 nude mice bearing D341 medulloblastoma
tumors. D341 cells (2.0  104 cells per mouse) were injected into the
cerebellum of CD-1 nude mice as described above. Six days after
implantation of tumor cells, the animals were injected i.t with 5  106
PFUs of vMyxgfp or DV every other day for a total of three injections. For
combination therapy, animals were randomly divided into four groups (eight
animals per group): (a) DV controls, (b) treatment with vMyxgfp alone, (c)
treatment with rapamycin alone, and (d) treatment with vMyxgfp in
combination with rapamycin. Virus was administered with 5 mg/kg/d
rapamycin injected i.p. beginning 5 days after tumor implantation ( five
times weekly for 2 weeks). For survival studies ( five animals per group),
animals were followed until sacrifice was required or the experiment was
terminated. The brain, spinal cord, and major organs were removed for
histological examination. For studies of myxoma virus distribution, animals
were sacrificed 48 h after treatment (three animals per treatment group).
The brain was imaged in situ using a stereotactic microscope with a GFP
filter. To quantitate GFP expression within tumors, the entire cerebellum
was cut into sagittal sections, and GFP expression in each section was
imaged using a fluorescence stereomicroscope. The section with the largest
amount of GFP expression was analyzed with ImagePro software to quantify
both the area of GFP expression and the total tumor area. Animals were
perfused with PBS, and the brains and spinal cords were removed,
embedded with ornithine carbamyl transferase, and sectioned for
immunohistochemistry.
Statistical analyses. Statistical analysis software (SAS Institute, Inc.) and
GraphPad Prism (version 4; GraphPad Software, Inc.) were used for
statistical analyses. Survival curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier
method. The log-rank test and two-way ANOVA were used to compare the
distributions of survival times and tumor sizes, respectively. Four treatment

groups (DV, rapamycin alone, vMyxgfp + rapamycin, and vMyxgfp alone)
were used to investigate individual and combined effects on killing of
medulloblastoma cells. We compared the effect of each combined regimen
with each of the two individual treatment strategies as well as the control
samples by means of a Student’s t test. All reported P values were two sided
and considered to be statistically significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Myxoma virus productively infects and kills most medulloblastoma cell lines in vitro. Ten medulloblastoma cell lines were
tested for susceptibility to infection and killing by myxoma virus by
analyzing cytopathic effect, the expression of early and late viral
genes, and cell viability. All medulloblastoma cell lines with the
exception of the D384 cells were permissive to infection, as shown
by evidence of visible cytopathic effect and the expression of both
early (GFP) and late (h-galactosidase) viral markers 48 h after
infection with vMyxgfp or vMyxlac, respectively (representative
examples in Fig. 1A; data for D283, D425, TE671, and UW228 cells
are not shown). The D384 medulloblastoma cell line and the mouse
fibroblast cell line NIH3T3 were poorly permissive to infection with
myxoma virus and expressed very low levels of virally encoded GFP
and h-galactosidase (Fig. 1A). There was no evidence of cytopathic
effect or viral gene expression in untreated or DV-treated cells at
any time point assessed (data not shown).
Cell viability assays (WST-1) confirmed the results from the
cytopathic effect assays. Nine of the 10 medulloblastoma cell lines
were susceptible to killing by myxoma virus and extensive cell
death was observed 72 h after infection with 10 MOI of vMyxgfp
(<30% of cells still viable; Fig. 1B). In contrast, D384 medulloblastoma cells and untransformed NIH3T3 cells were resistant to
myxoma virus infection, with >80% of cells surviving 72 h after
exposure to 10 MOI of vMyxgfp. Similar results were obtained when
cell viability was assessed 72 h after infection with 10 MOI of
vMyxlac (data not shown).
One of the benefits of replication-competent oncolytic viral
therapy is the ability of viral progeny produced during the infection
to spread and infect other cells within the tumor. To confirm the
presence of a productive viral infection, expression of early (M-T7)
and late (Serp-1) viral proteins was assessed by Western blotting
48 h after infection with 5 MOI of vMyxgfp. All of the six medulloblastoma cell lines susceptible to infection expressed both M-T7
and Serp-1 48 h after infection (Fig. 2A). The resistant D384
medulloblastoma cells expressed low levels of M-T7 but no Serp-1,
whereas no M-T7 or Serp-1 protein could be detected in lysates
from untransformed NIH3T3 cells.
Myxoma virus titers in supernatants from susceptible medulloblastoma cell lines were increased f3- to 5-fold compared with the
original input viral titer (Fig. 2B) and cell-line specific differences in
the extent of viral replication correlated with the susceptibility of a
given cell line to viral infection. There was no significant viral
replication in D384 or NIH3T3 cells.
Pretreatment with rapamycin promotes myxoma virus–
mediated oncolysis and enhances viral replication in medulloblastoma cell lines in vitro. Treatment with rapamycin in vitro
increases myxoma virus tropism in poorly permissive human cell
lines (33). To determine whether pretreatment with rapamycin
enhanced myxoma virus oncolysis of medulloblastoma cell lines
in vitro, cell viability was assessed 72 h after infection in the
presence or absence of rapamycin. Treatment with vMyxgfp and
rapamycin resulted in greater cell killing than either treatment
alone for Daoy, D341, and D384 cell lines (P < 0.001, t test,

Fig. 3A and B; P < 0.05, t test, Fig. 3C). Combined treatment with
rapamycin and myxoma virus had no effect on the viability of the
control NIH3T3 cell line (P > 0.05, t test; Fig. 3D).
We then tested whether replication of myxoma virus was
enhanced in cells treated with rapamycin. Treatment of medulloblastoma cell lines with both vMyxgfp and rapamycin increased
viral titers 72 h after infection compared with virus alone (Fig. 3E).
Daoy and D341 cells, which were fully susceptible to myxoma virus

infection, showed significant increases in viral titers in the
presence of rapamycin. There was a very small increase in viral
titer in D384 cells treated with rapamycin, but the level of virus
replication was still less than that observed in either Daoy or D341
cells in the absence of rapamycin. The mTOR inhibitor had no
significant effect on viral titers in vMyxgfp-treated NIH3T3 cells.
Rapamycin increases activation of Akt in medulloblastoma
cells. The PI3K/Akt pathway is constitutively activated in many

medulloblastoma cells following stimulation of the IGF-I receptor
(21, 39, 40), and susceptibility of human cancer cells to infection
with myxoma virus is directly correlated to levels of activated Akt
(18, 33). Rapamycin increases both Akt activation and myxoma
virus replication in a variety of different cancer cell lines in vitro
(33), but its effect on medulloblastoma cells had not been
evaluated. To determine whether similar effects were observed
when medulloblastoma cells were treated with rapamycin, Daoy,
D341, D384, and NIH 3T3 cells were infected with DV or vMyxgfp
(MOI of 5), with or without rapamycin pretreatment. Forty-eight
hours after infection, levels of phosphorylated (and activated)
Akt and p70S6K (a downstream substrate and effector of mTOR)
were determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 4A and B,
rapamycin alone and vMyxgfp alone were able to increase phosphorylation of both Ser473 and Thr308 of Akt in Daoy and D341 cells
(Fig. 4A and B, lanes 2 and 3). UV-inactivated vMyxgfp virus had no
effect on phosphorylation levels of Akt (data not shown).
Combined treatment with rapamycin and vMyxgfp also increased
levels of phosphorylated Akt compared with untreated control
cells, with the extent of activation being similar to that seen in cells
treated with rapamycin alone (Fig. 4A and B, compare lanes 2
and 4). In both Daoy and D341 cells, levels of phosphorylated
p70S6K were unchanged by infection with vMyxgfp alone (Fig. 4A
and B, compare lanes 1 and 3), but, as expected, no phosphorylated p70S6K could be detected in cells treated with rapamycin,
indicating that rapamycin was effectively inhibiting mTOR under
the conditions used (Fig. 4A and B, compare lanes 1 and 2). In
the poorly permissive D384 medulloblastoma cells, treatment
with rapamycin or MV alone or in combination did not increase
phosphorylation of Akt at either Ser473 or Thr308 in D384 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A), and only a small increase in phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308 was seen when MV and rapamycin were
used in combination in NIH3T3 cells, but not at Ser473, which is
required for full activation (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These data

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

are consistent with previous experiments where ectopic expression
of constitutively active Akt1 render nonpermissive cancer cells
susceptible to myxoma virus infection (18). Taken together, these
results show that rapamycin not only inhibits mTOR kinase activity
but also enhances Akt activation in human medulloblastoma cells
that are susceptible to myxoma virus oncolysis.
I.t. administration of myxoma virus prolongs survival in
Daoy tumor-bearing mice. To determine the efficacy of myxoma
virus oncolysis in vivo, the effect of myxoma virus treatment in the
presence or absence of rapamycin was evaluated in a Daoy
medulloblastoma orthotopic xenograft model. Daoy cells were
injected into the cerebellum of CD-1 nude mice to establish
tumors. Twelve days later, vMyxgfp was injected i.t. (5  106 PFUs
per mouse) and animals were monitored to assess survival. A single
i.t. injection of vMyxgfp prolonged survival (P = 0.0021; Fig. 5A) and
produced long-term survivors [three of five (60%) mice] that were
apparently cured. The median survival of live virus (LV)–treated
animals was not reached because only two of the five animals
treated died during the course of the experiment (which lasted a
total of 223 days). In contrast, all DV-treated animals [five of five
(100%) mice] died with a significantly shorter median survival of
75 days (P = 0.0021, log-rank test). This survival experiment was
repeated with similar results (data not shown). Histologic analysis
showed that all of the DV-treated mice had large tumors in the
cerebellum with compression of the brain stem (Fig. 5B). The two
LV-treated animals that died both had recurrent or residual tumor
in the brain stem (data not shown). Two LV-treated long-term
survivors had no residual tumor either in the cerebellum or
elsewhere in the brain (data not shown), whereas one LV-treated
long-term survivor had a very tiny residual tumor (Fig. 5B).
To better model the clinical situation of a large established
tumor, we used a ‘‘late-stage’’ animal model to test the efficacy of
vMyxgfp (Fig. 5C). For these experiments, vMyxgfp was injected i.t.
25 days after tumor implantation (5  106 PFUs per mouse) on

3 separate days. Multiple injections of vMyxgfp significantly
prolonged survival of ‘‘late-stage’’ animals bearing Daoy medulloblastoma tumors. The median survival of DV-treated animals was
35 days, whereas LV-treated animals had a median survival of
56 days (P = 0.0279, log-rank test; Fig. 5C).
Rapamycin enhances myxoma virus oncolysis and reduces
metastasis in vivo in Daoy-GFP tumor-bearing mice. Because
rapamycin enhanced myxoma virus killing of medulloblastoma cell
lines in vitro, we tested combination therapy with myxoma virus
and rapamycin in the Daoy-GFP medulloblastoma mouse model to
see if rapamycin could also enhance myxoma virus oncolysis
in vivo. Daoy-GFP tumor-bearing mice were created by injecting
2  105 cells into the cerebellum of CD-1 nude mice. Eleven days
after tumor implantation, rapamycin or a vehicle control was
injected i.p. The following day, DV or vMyxgfp was injected i.t.
Treatment with live vMyxgfp alone significantly enhanced survival
of mice harboring Daoy-GFP human medulloblastoma xenografts
(P = 0.0002 compared with DV control; Fig. 5D), but treating the

mice with a combination of vMyxgfp and rapamycin was even
more effective (P < 0.0001 compared with DV control; Fig. 5D).
Treatment with a combination of vMyxgfp and rapamycin also
significantly prolonged survival compared with treatment with
vMyxgfp alone (P = 0.0398; Fig. 5D). Rapamycin alone had a small
effect on survival but this difference was not statistically significant
(P = 0.1167 compared with DV control; Fig. 5D). Three animals in
each group were sacrificed 30 days after virus treatment and
ventricular and spinal cord metastases were quantified by
counting GFP-expressing tumor foci (Fig. 5E). We found that all
DV (n = 3) or rapamycin-treated (n = 3) animals had at least five to
six spinal cord metastases per mouse and at least two to three
ventricular metastases per mouse. For animals treated with
myxoma virus alone (n = 3), one animal had two spinal cord
metastases and one animal had a single ventricular metastasis. In
animals treated with a combination of myxoma virus and
rapamycin (n = 3), no ventricular or spinal cord metastases were
observed.

in D341 tumors in vivo, we implanted D341 cells into the
cerebellum of CD-1 nude mice and treated the mice with vMyxgfp
and rapamycin using the same doses and schedule of injections
described for the Daoy tumor-bearing mice (early-stage model).
Animals were sacrificed 48 h after virus injection and the brains
were examined using fluorescence stereomicroscopy. Treatment
with rapamycin 24 h before injection of myxoma virus markedly
increased the anatomic area of viral GFP expression (f56% of
tumor cells expressed GFP; Fig. 6C) compared with treatment with
vMyxgfp alone (f7.0% of tumor cells expressed GFP; Fig. 6C).
Immunohistochemistry confirmed that the increase in GFP
expression corresponded to an increase in expression of the
M-T7 viral protein within tumors (Fig. 6C).
To determine if combination therapy resulted in a significant
prolongation of survival, we implanted D341 cells into the
cerebellum of CD-1 nude mice and 6 days later treated with DV,
vMyxgfp, rapamycin alone, or vMyxgfp and rapamycin using the
doses and injection schedules described above. Treatment of
animals with vMyxgfp significantly prolonged survival compared
with DV-treated animals (P = 0.0018); however, mice treated with
rapamycin and i.t. injections of vMyxgfp (median survival of 25
days) survived significantly longer than animals treated with
vMyxgfp alone, rapamycin alone, or DV (median survival of 19, 13,
and 11 days, respectively; P < 0.0001, log-rank test, combination
group compared with control group; Fig. 6D).

Discussion

Figure 4. Rapamycin increases activation of Akt in human susceptible
medulloblastoma cells. Daoy (A ) and D341 (B ) cells were pretreated with
rapamycin (20 nmol/L) for 1 h, and then the cells were infected with vMyxgfp
(5 MOI). Levels of phosphorylated p70S6K (P-p70S6K) and phosphorylated
Akt (at Ser473 and Thr308; P-Akt473 and P-Akt308 ) in cell lysates were
determined by Western blotting. Total Akt and mTOR levels were not changed.

I.t. administration of myxoma virus prolongs survival in
reovirus-resistant D341 tumor-bearing mice. The D341 medulloblastoma cell line is resistant to oncolysis by reovirus (37);
however, our in vitro experiments showed that these cells are
susceptible to infection and killing by myxoma virus. To analyze the
in vivo efficacy of myxoma virus against medulloblastoma tumors
that are resistant to other oncolytic agents, we determined whether
i.t. injection of myxoma virus could induce tumor regression in CD1 nude mice bearing orthotopic D341 tumors. Six days after tumor
implantation in the cerebellum, mice were given three i.t. injections
of vMyxgfp (5  106 PFUs per mouse) every other day. Treatment
with live vMyxgfp significantly prolonged survival (median survival
of LV-treated animals was 20.5 days versus 13 days for DV-treated
animals; P = 0.0008, log-rank test; Fig. 6A). Histologic analysis
showed that all of the DV-treated mice and LV-treated mice had
large tumors in the cerebellum. The D341 tumor model showed
more invasion into the brain and increased compression of the
brain stem compared with the Daoy tumor model (Fig. 6B).
Immunohistochemical analysis showed expression of the viral
protein MT7 in tumors from vMyxgfp-treated animals, indicating
the presence of a productive viral infection in vivo (Fig. 6B).

Although there are ongoing clinical trials evaluating oncolytic
virotherapy of malignant brain tumors in adults (8–10), there are
little data available on the toxicity and efficacy of such an approach
in children with medulloblastoma (11, 37). This is the first
demonstration of the potential usefulness of replication-competent
myxoma virus against experimental models of medulloblastoma,
both as a single agent and in combination with rapamycin.
Myxoma virus infects and kills most medulloblastoma tumor cell
lines tested in vitro, prolongs survival of animals bearing implanted
medulloblastoma tumors, is safe when administered i.c. in normal
mice (41), and is nonpathogenic in humans (13). Myxoma virus in
combination with rapamycin dramatically reduced spinal cord and
ventricular metastases in a medulloblastoma mouse model.
However, myxoma virus and reovirus were unable to induce
regression of uninoculated tumors in bilateral mouse glioma
models (7, 12). Insufficient viral delivery is a key limitation in the
treatment of intraparenchymal multifocal malignant gliomas (see
ref. 41 and references therein), and it is likely that the successful
targeting of metastatic cells in medulloblastoma is due to more
efficient viral spread in the cerebral spinal fluid, where medulloblastoma cells ordinarily disseminate. This observation may be
important therapeutically because decreased metastasis could
allow the use of lower doses of radiation to a much smaller area
of the central nervous system and significantly reduce treatmentrelated toxicity in children with developing nervous systems.
Although reovirus is effective in prolonging survival and
reducing metastasis in medulloblastoma animal models (37), it is
also clear that some brain tumor cells are resistant to reovirus
oncolysis (37, 42). The ability of myxoma virus to productively
infect and kill reovirus-resistant D341 cells both in vitro and in vivo
suggests that myxoma virus may be a valuable therapeutic option
in reovirus-resistant tumors and may address the problem of innate
or acquired resistance. Differences in the susceptibility of particular

Myxoma Virus Oncolysis of Medulloblastoma

tumor cell types to distinct oncolytic viruses probably reflect the
differing tropism requirements of a given virus combined with the
heterogeneity that is observed in the signaling microenvironments
of different tumors. Indeed, whereas myxoma virus requires Akt
activation for permissivity, susceptibility to reovirus oncolysis is
highly correlated with the presence of activated Ras (37, 42) and
high levels of protease activity in the tumor milieu (43). The unique
pattern of up-regulation or down-regulation of specific signaling
pathways will therefore determine the success or failure of viral
oncolysis of a given tumor. Combination therapies with agents that
selectively modify important signaling pathways have the potential
to significantly increase the efficacy of oncolytic viruses.

We found that combination therapy with myxoma virus and the
mTOR inhibitor rapamycin was significantly more effective than
either agent alone in killing medulloblastoma cells both in vitro
and in vivo. This result is consistent with our previous in vitro
demonstration of the synergy between rapamycin and myxoma
virus oncolysis in nonmedulloblastoma cell lines (33) and is the first
demonstration that a similar synergy occurs in vivo. Rapamycin has
several additional properties that make it an attractive candidate
for combination therapy with myxoma virus. Rapamycin has no
known inhibitory effect on viral replication in medulloblastoma
(data not shown) and thus it does not interfere with virally
mediated oncolysis. The lipophilic nature of rapamycin enables it to

easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Rapamycin has low toxicity and
can directly inhibit brain tumor growth by blocking tumor cell
proliferation and angiogenesis (25–30), in addition to its enhancement of myxoma virus tropism. Because it has already been used in
the clinic (23), rapamycin is immediately available for use in clinical
trials designed to evaluate its efficacy in combination with myxoma
virus or other oncolytic viruses of interest. The successful use of
rapamycin to specifically modulate a signaling pathway known to
be important in myxoma virus tropism suggests that a rationally
targeted therapeutic strategy combining mTOR inhibitors and
myxoma virus could enhance viral oncolysis in patients.
The mechanism by which rapamycin enhances myxoma virus
oncolysis of human medulloblastoma is not known. It may be
due to inhibition of the innate immune response, disruption of the
IFN response, the induction of apoptosis or autophagy, and/or
alterations in other signaling pathways (23, 27, 44). Rapamycin is
also an immunosuppressant, and this may enhance its effectiveness
in vivo but not in vitro. We found, as described previously in other
types of cancer cell lines (33), that rapamycin-mediated sensitization of medulloblastoma cells to myxoma virus infection correlated
with an increase in the level of Akt activation. There is substantial
evidence that the IGF-I signaling pathway is highly activated in
medulloblastoma and contributes to transformation (23, 40), and it
is possible that rapamycin up-regulates Akt in medulloblastoma

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

cells by affecting IGF-I receptor signaling. Studies of insulin and
IGF-I signaling in Drosophila (45) and in mammalian cells (46, 47)
describe a negative feedback loop in which mTOR inhibits insulin
receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1)–mediated signaling by activating
p70S6K, which subsequently phosphorylates IRS-1 and promotes
its degradation via the proteasome. This leads to down-regulation
of the PI3K/Akt pathway, which is normally activated downstream
of insulin or IGF-I following recruitment of PI3K to active receptor/
IRS-1 signaling complexes. A similar negative feedback loop
operating through mTOR may exist in medulloblastoma cells.
Alternatively, Akt-independent signaling effects downstream of
mTOR may be involved in the synergistic interaction of rapamycin
and myxoma virus. The molecular mechanisms through which
rapamycin is able to enhance myxoma virotherapy are currently
under investigation in our laboratories.
Our study has several limitations. First, we have not yet
evaluated myxoma virus in immunocompetent models of medulloblastoma where distribution of the virus within the brain may be
impeded by significant immune responses. Second, the precise
mechanisms by which myxoma virus kills medulloblastoma cells
and the mechanisms through which rapamycin enhances oncolysis
by myxoma virus are not yet fully understood. It will be of
particular importance to determine whether Shh signaling is
important in the mechanism of action of myxoma virus and

rapamycin because it has been shown recently that the Shh
pathway is irreversibly suppressed in medulloblastoma cells that
are cultured in vitro (48), although there is strong evidence that Shh
signaling is important in medulloblastoma tumorigenesis in vivo
(22, 23). This finding raises concerns about the use of cultured
medulloblastoma tumor cells in preclinical animal models that test
therapies that may be affected by Shh signaling. We are now
exploring strategies that will enable us to pursue preclinical studies
in more appropriate immunocompetent animal models to increase
our understanding of the mechanisms involved in viral oncolysis of
medulloblastoma.
