ABSTRACT
Ku70-dependent canonical nonhomologous end-joining (c-NHEJ) DNA repair
system is fundamental to the genome maintenance and B-cell lineage. c-NHEJ is
upregulated and error-prone in incurable forms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia
which also displays telomere dysfunction, multiple chromosomal aberrations and
the resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We identify in these cells a novel
DNA damage inducible form of phospho-Ku70. In vitro in different cancer cell lines,
Ku70 phosphorylation occurs in a heterodimer Ku70/Ku80 complex within minutes
of genotoxic stress, necessitating its interaction with DNA damage-induced kinase
pS2056-DNA-PKcs and/or pS1981-ATM. The mutagenic effects of phospho-Ku70 are
documented by a defective S/G2 checkpoint, accelerated disappearance of γ-H2AX
foci and kinetics of DNA repair resulting in an increased level of genotoxic stressinduced chromosomal aberrations. Together, these data unveil an involvement of
phospho-Ku70 in fast but inaccurate DNA repair; a new paradigm linked to both the
deregulation of c-NHEJ and the resistance of malignant cells.

defective apoptosis dogma has persisted even when the
homeostatic balance or imbalance in the dynamic interplay
between proliferation and cell death has been proposed as
a new hallmark of stable (indolent) or progressive forms
of CLL, respectively [4]. However, the mechanisms
responsible for inducing a switch to the aggressive forms
of this disease remain unclear. Aggressive CLL develops
in one third of patients who then succumb rapidly due to
the lack of effective therapies. Front-line treatments using

INTRODUCTION
The widespread heterogeneous clinical course
of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) relies on the
variable extent of the genetic alterations that are related
to chemorefractoriness and disease progression [1].
Historically, the first pathway to be identified as defective in
CLL was the apoptotic death pathway, and this dysregulation
still remains a paradigm of CLL maintenance [2, 3]. This

alkylating agents or purine nucleoside analogues mediate
cell death through DNA damages, including double strand
breaks (DSBs), and p53-dependent apoptosis [5, 6]. The
loss of the p53 protein, or of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia
mutated) gene product which acts upstream of p53, has
been associated with drug resistance and shortened survival
times [6, 7]. Recently, Notch signaling was proposed as a
responsible p53-inducible antiapoptotic mechanism that
should be considered in future apoptotic targeting [8, 9].
We have previously reported that 20% of CLL cell
samples are resistant to DNA damage-induced apoptosis
(R-CLL), irrespective of their p53 status, whilst the
remaining cases have p53wt-expressing sensitive cells
(S-CLL) [2]. Accelerated DNA repair and the accumulation
of chromosomal aberrations have been observed in R-CLL
[10]. Moreover, the upregulation of nonhomologous endjoining (NHEJ), in R-CLL was found to be error-prone in
vitro and thus potentially mutagenic in vivo [11, 12]. These
findings were concomitant with a telomeric dysfunction
with increased Ku70 co-localization, increased level of
DSBs and multiple chromosomal aberrations occurring
in an R-CLL subset [13, 14]. Based on these results, we
hypothesized that the resistance of malignant cells to
genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis is specific to a new
subset of DNA repair-related disease that is p53-independent
and that may depend on a delay in the persistence of DNA
damage signaling. The potential impact of such resistance
upon the onset of malignancy is likely to be increased by the
fact that on the resulting block on apoptosis induction may
contribute to the emergence of additional resistant clones
from a proliferative pool of mutant cells.
Ionizing irradiation- and cytotoxic drug-induced
DSBs, including those caused by fludarabine, are
repaired mainly by NHEJ which is the major cell cycleindependent repair pathway for this type of DNA damage
in mammalian cells [15–19]. More recent discoveries have
proposed the existence of two distinct NHEJ pathways
acting with fast or slow kinetics, with different efficiencies
and accuracy of the final repair product, and that are
dependent on different factors [20–24]. The central player
in classical NHEJ (c-NHEJ) is certainly the DNA-PK
trimer containing the Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer that acts as
a scaffold for the recruitment of core or processing factors,
DNA-PKcs and Artemis, that further recruit the ligation
Cernunos(XLF)/XRCC4/LigaseIV complex [25–27]. In
addition, a phosphorylation cascade may facilitate the
fine-tuning of the various stages of this repair process
[28]. However, although DNA-PKcs may potentially
phosphorylate nearly all members of the NHEJ complex,
only its auto-phosphorylation regulates NHEJ activity [24,
25, 29]. As the overactivation of NHEJ activity in R-CLL
is correlated with enhanced DNA end-binding of Ku70/
Ku80 heterodimer without an increase in its expression
[11], we next hypothesized that the post-translational
modifications (PTMs) of Ku may be a critical step in the
development of aggressive forms of CLL.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In this context, we investigated the presence of
PTMs on the Ku heterodimer combining high-resolution
2D-gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and mass spectrometry
(MS) analysis of CLL proteins. These approaches allowed
us to identify the phospho-ser27-Ku70 overexpressed in
the resistant form of CLL. Further, from 2D-PAGE data
analyses (pI displacements), phosphatase λ and/or irradiation
treatments, the highly conserved proximal serine residue
between species, serine-33 was deduced as a second site of
phosphorylation occurring concomitantly with serine-27.
Monoclonal antibodies, produced in mouse hybridoma cells,
revealed that Ku70 phosphorylation occurs within minutes of
genotoxic stress and involves DNA-PKcs and/or ATM kinase
activities. By using specific vectors enabling the simultaneous
shRNA-mediated inhibition of endogenous Ku70 and the
expression of exogenous Ku70 resistant to shRNA (i.e. S27S33-Ku70 and A27-A33-Ku70 expressing cells), we showed
that phospho-Ku70 contributes to faster but error-prone DNA
repair resulting in higher levels of chromosomal breaks. The
persistence of this new form of Ku70 and the convergence of
its putative functions underline a new paradigm for c-NHEJ
regulation, which is involved in DNA damage repair and in
observed instability in cancer cells.

RESULTS
Identification of a phosphorylated form of Ku70
in chemoresistant leukemia cells
We exploited the high-resolution potential of
2D-PAGE to compare the PTM of the Ku heterodimer
between two subgroups of CLL defined by their sensitivity or
resistance to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and ability to
upregulate NHEJ (Supplementary Table S1). Ku heterodimer
was purified by protein immunoprecipitation using Ku70 or
Ku80 monoclonal antibodies followed by 2D-PAGE (Figure
1A). The different forms of Ku70 and Ku80 present in S-CLL
cells were resolved, respectively, as four spots (spots N°
1, 2, 3 and 4) and at least six spots with similar molecular
weights but different isoelectric points (pI). In representative
R-CLL cells, Ku70 isoforms were resolved as six spots,
three of which were more abundant (N° 2, 5 and 6) and
had a lower pI. The intensity of spot N°2 was found to be
markedly increased in R-CLL cells (2- to 2.5-fold) compared
with S-CLL. Phosphorylation was the principal PTM since
λ-phosphatase treatment reduced the number of Ku70 spots
(Figure 1B). These results were confirmed in B cells from one
healthy, six R-CLL and eight S-CLL donors (Figure 1C). We
further analyzed Ku70 phosphorylation in cellulo by inducing
DSBs by ionizing irradiation (IR) or neocarzinostatin (NCS)
(Figure 2A, 2B and Supplementary Figure S1). Ku70
phosphorylation was detected at higher levels 30 min after
exposure to NCS in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 2B
and Supplementary Figure S1). The number of S-CLL cells
with characteristic apoptotic morphology reached 85% at 15
hours after IR whilst the phosphorylation of Ku70 remained

still strongly induced. This suggests that apoptotic DNA
fragmentation also induced Ku70 phosphorylation (Figure
2A). Similar results were observed with immunopurified Ku
heterodimer (i.e., using an anti-Ku80 antibody) indicating
that the IR-induced phosphorylation of Ku70 occurs in
heterodimeric complexes. Notably, Ku70 phosphorylation
occurred in vivo in patients treated with fludarabine (Figure
2C), demonstrating that Ku70 is subjected to multiple
phosphorylation events following genotoxic stress both in
cellulo and in vivo.
Tandem MS/MS and MSn experiments identified a
major site of Ku70 phosphorylation at position serine-27
(Supplementary Figure S2A). We compared the 2D gel
patterns of exogenous His-Ku70 obtained from HeLa cells
co-transfected with His-wtKu70 or His-Ku70-S27A in which
serine-27 was replaced by a neutral alanine (Supplementary
Figure S2C). As expected, the S27A substitution altered
the number of spots in the gel, confirming that Ku70-spot
N°2 was indeed the S27-phosphorylated form of Ku70
(pS27-K70). Of note, the alignment of sequences from
diverse organisms revealed a second highly conserved
serine residue at position 33, additionally highlighting that
even more acidic Ku70 spots should correspond to a double
phosphorylation of Ku70 (spots N°5 and 6, Figure 1 and 2).

S27-Ku70 phosphorilation following irradiation treatment
(Figure 4F), further argues a redundant involvement of both
DNA-PKcs and ATM in S27-Ku70 phosphorylation. Staining
of untreated R-CLL cells showed both a cytoplasmic and
nuclear distribution of pS27-Ku70 (Figure 5A), as well as
a marked increase in the pS27-Ku70 level in R-CLL cells
compared with S-CLL cells (immunofluorescent staining
not shown). Interestingly, early after irradiation pS27-Ku70
localized only in the nuclei of irradiated R-CLL cells and
appeared to colocalize with pS2056-DNA-PKcs at the sites
of the DNA DSBs. In contrast, a strict colocalisation of pS27Ku70 was not evidenced in large γ-H2AX foci covering
several megabases of chromatin DNA in irradiated ZR 75.1
cells (Figure 5B). Indeed, pS27-Ku70 labelling covers nearly
all chromatin area (excepting nucleoli due to the extraction
RNase treatment by cytoskeleton buffer).

pS27-S33-Ku70 contributes to faster DNA repair,
a shorter S phase and greater chromosomal
damage
We generated stable sublines from the breast cancer
cell line ZR75.1, which overexpressed either the wildtype S27-S33-Ku70 protein (wt-Ku70), its mutated A27A33-Ku70 form or the phosphomimetic E27-E33-Ku70
form, using the replicative pEBVsiKu70-CAGKu70(R/
, pEBVsiKu70-CAGKu70(R/A27-A33), or pEBVsiKu70S27-S33)
CAGKu70(R/E27-E33) plasmids, respectively. We chose to
study the function of Ku70 phosphorylation using breast
cancer p53wt-expressing cell lines because of the absence
of an established CLL-derived cell line. A particularly
notable aspect of the vectors used in our experiments
was their coding siRNA sequence enabling an inhibition
of endogenous Ku70 (eKu70) and the expression of
modified cDNA sequences of Ku70 resistant to siRNA.
Efficient phosphorylation of Ku70 at serine-27 was thus
only observed after IR in S27-S33-Ku70-expressing cells,
demonstrating the effective inhibition of eKu70 expression,
as well as the expression of mutated forms (Figure 6A).
We further investigated both cell cycle checkpoint
control and S phase progression following genotoxic
stress. The fraction of cells arrested in G2 phase was
higher for A27-A33-Ku70- than for wt-Ku70-expressing
cells (Figure 6B; E27-E33-Ku70-expressing cell data
not shown), with a marked difference at 12, 24 and 48 h
post-irradiation. In contrast, a faster S-phase progression
was documented in wt-Ku70-expressing cells following
irradiation (Figure 6C). Intrigued by the fact that A27-A33Ku70 cells proliferate more slowly than S27-S33-Ku70
cells, we performed a real-time integrative assessment
of cell proliferation, growth and membrane potential,
commonly designated as a cell index or impedance [34–
36]. Notably, the cell index (Figure 6D) confirmed a slower
proliferation of A27-A33-Ku70-expressing cells prior to
IR. Conversely, irradiated A27-A33-Ku70 cells showed
higher proliferation rate than the two other cell lines tested,

pS27-Ku70 is phosphorylated by PI3-K kinases,
interacts with pS2056-DNA-PKcs and pS1981ATM
To identify the protein kinase involved in the DSBinduced phosphorylation of Ku70, we treated CLL cells
(Figure 3A, 3B) and the HeLa DNA-PKcskd cell line [30]
(Figure 3C, 3D) with NCS in the presence of wortmannin
(WM), a PI3 kinase and PI3-like kinase inhibitor, or with
NU7026, which at low concentrations inhibits DNAPKcs but not ATM or ATR [31]. Both p53 and XRCC4
phosphorylation were used as controls [32, 33]. Our
experimental conditions indicated that the phosphorylation of
Ku70 is dependent on DNA-PKcs but also showed that other
DNA DSB-sensing PI3-kinases, such as ATM, could also
be involved in the regulation of Ku70 phosphorylation. To
complement these analyses, a monoclonal antibody directed
against pS27-Ku70 documented an increase of IR-induced
Ku70 phosphorylation in both S-CLL (Figure 4A) and
HeLa cells (data not shown). As shown in Figure 4B, pS27Ku70 was found to be absent in irradiated protein extracts
treated by l-phosphatase, as well as in modified cell lines
expressing an unphosphorylable form of Ku70 (see below).
Co-immunoprecipitations using anti-pS2056-DNA-PKcs and
anti-p1981-ATM antibodies demonstrated that pS27-Ku70
interacts with pS2056-DNA-PKcs following IR (Figure 4C
and 4D). The experiment with PI-3K kinase deficient cell
line GM03189 expressing mutated ATM, demonstrated a
very weak increase in S27-Ku70 phosphorylation (Figure
4E). DNA-PKcs deficient cell line MO59J treated with ATM
inhibitor KU55933 which did not exhibited an increase in

suggesting that the phosphorylation of Ku70 may control
other cellular functions independently of DNA repair.
When the protein level (Figure 6E) or the kinetic
of disappearance of γ-H2AX foci (Figure 6F) were
analyzed, then both experiments indicated the higher
persistence of this marker at 2 to 6 h post-irradaition in
cells expressing mutated form of Ku70 as compared to
wt-type or phosphomimetic form expressing cells. This
was further validated by the Supplementary quantified and
statistically analyzed assays (Figure 6G). Of note, cells
expressing phosphomimetic form of Ku70 dysplayed an
intermediate kinetic of γ-H2AX disappearance. In parallel,
we probed other DNA damage associated foci dynamics
in mutated- and wt-Ku70 cells (Supplementary Figure
S3A and S3B). Interestingly, in these two cell lines up to
6 hrs following irradiation at 2Gy, the kinetic of p1981SATM foci appeared to be concomitant to these of γ-H2AX
while the kinetic of 53BP1 foci occurred independently
of Ku70 mutational status (Supplementary Figure
S3A and S3B). Concerning pS27-Ku70 localisation,
the labelling progressively widespreaded all nuclear
area similarly to the labelling of total Ku70 at 2 h
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

postirradiation (Supplementary Figure S4 upper and
lower panel, respectively). Of note, at this time-point
the labelling of nuclear pS2056-DNA-PKcs disappeared
suggesting a putative nuclear role for pS27-Ku70 in
DNA dynamic independent of DNA damage throught
NHEJ. This is further supported by the increased protein
level of phospho-Ku70 lately after genotoxic stress (see
Supplementary Figure S4A and Figure S4B). Indeed, both
ZR75.1 (Figure 4A) and Ramos cells resistant to DNA
damage-induced apoptsis, after repeated exposures to
lower doses of irradiation at 1Gy (a unique dose which did
not induced Ku phosphorylation), per week/cell platting/
passaging, exhibited an accumulation of phospho-Ku70.
Also, different cancer cell lines (Supplementary Figure
S4C), known to exhibit high level of genomic instability,
display a variable but high level of phospho-Ku70 even
in absence of exogenous genotoxic stress. Of note, BL2
lymphoblasts sensitive to apoptosis initiation by DNA
damage, expresses a lower level of pS27-Ku70. We
next performed comet assays to assess the DNA repair
kinetics in two ZR75.1 sublines. To assess both DNA
single and double strand break resolution, we used the

estimated by the comet tail lengths, comet tail moment
and olive tail moment (OTM) (Figure 6H), S27-S33Ku70-expressing cells recovered up to 40% of their DNA
damage within minutes (T0 and 5min post-irradiation,
p < 0.0001), with nearly all DNA damage found to be
repaired at 15 minutes after IR. In contrast, A27-A33Ku70-expressing cells showed significantly higher

levels of residual DNA damage and still underwent
DNA damage repair at 30 min after IR. A significant
difference in OTM was also observed between control
cell lines, underlying higher levels of endogenous stress in
S27-S33-Ku70-expressing cells. To further explore
whether accuracy of DNA repair was affected in our
transfected cells, we examined metaphase chromosomes
after the first cell division following IR. For this purpose,

To verify whether the observed acceleration of the
kinetic of DNA damage repair may relay on an altered
binding of Ku heterodimer to free DNA-ends, we next
performed an in vitro assay as described elsewere [11].

malignant cells had progressed from an initial apoptotic
sensitivity to a tolerance of DNA damage. Here, we
provide evidence that these cells overexpress a new form
phospho-Ku70. Two phosphorylable serine residues on
Ku70 at positions 27 and 33 were experimentally found
to be important for the function of this protein in response
to DNA damage. In randomly screened 14 patient CLL
samples (8 S-CLL and 6 R-CLL) for which we previously
established global NHEJ activity, we observed altered
phospho-Ku70 expression (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Table S1). Because of the current lack of CLL-derived
cell lines, we mainly validated the functions of phosphoKu70 in the breast cancer cell line ZR75.1 (expressing
TP53wt) which expresses a basal level of phosphoKu70 that is further upregulated by genotoxic stress.
This further emphasizes that this new deregulation of

cancer which displays a DNA repair defect. This defect
is strikingly correlated to the clinical features and may
be further related to the appearance of new genetic and
chromosomal alterations. The underlying molecular
anomaly in circulating malignant cells may be the result
of inefficient front-line therapy. Notably, among a large

DNA repair may be a common molecular alteration in
chemoresistant cancer cells, as supported by the higher
basal level of phospho-Ku70 in cancer cell lines resistant
to DNA damage such as human glioma, osteosarcoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines or cells derived from
cancer of pancreas with a deficiency in homologous
recombination repair (Supplementary Figure S4C).
Although an induction of phospho-Ku70 occurs in vitro
with high doses of photon irradiation, a single perfusion
of fludarabine produced the same level of phospho-Ku70
induction in vivo (Figure 2C). Moreover, we repetitively
irradiated ZR75.1 cells or Ramos lymphoblasts in culture
at lower doses (single dose 1Gy) over 5 days or 7 weeks,
respectively and observed that this fractionated exposure
also induced Ku70 phosphorylation (Supplementary
Figure S4A and S4B). This finding may be relevant in
explaining why certain patients treated with low doses of
alkylating and/or base analogues agents (i.e. chlorambucil,
fludarabine) evolved to a more aggressive disease
expressing phospho-Ku70.
We find that the higher level of pKu70 protein in
malignant cells induced by genotoxic agents in vivo
contributes to a higher rate of DNA repair, a lower
susceptibility to apoptosis and is likely to be the source
of resistance to therapeutic treatments based on DNA
damaging drugs. In agreement with this, the inhibition
of NHEJ DNA repair can activate the apoptotic death
pathway and block cancer progression [40]. Thus,
systematic screening of the constitutive levels of phosphoKu70 in CLL patients who have never been treated could
potentially be a very useful marker for clinicians to
determine if front-line therapy should be replaced by other
treatments (such as immunotherapy). Varible but high
constitutive levels of pS27-Ku70 in cell lines derived from
different type of clinically resistant and instable cancers,
further support above hypothesis.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Resistant CLL has been shown to exhibit upregulated
and potentially mutagenic NHEJ [10–12]. In our current
study, we show that the phosphorylation of Ku70 on two
new sites alters the kinetics and accuracy of DNA repair.
Data presented here indicate that the phosphorylation of
serine-27 and serine-33 residues on Ku70 depends on the
PI-3K kinase family (DNA-PKcs and ATM), resulting in a
faster rate of DNA repair without affecting in vitro DNAend binding activity of heterodimer Ku (Figure 7). Only
the sites of autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs have been
used thus far to document the altered kinetics of NHEJ
[25, 29]. That factors other than kinases may regulate the
efficiency of NHEJ repair is supported by a recent study
which reported the involvement of phosphatase PP4 in this
type of DNA repair [41]. Fractionated irradiation in vitro
and the persistence of phospho-Ku70 levels several
months after in vivo administration of fludarabine, suggest
an implication of responsive phosphatase deficiency in
resistant cells.
The mammalian NHEJ DNA repair system, active
in all phases of the cell cycle, is promoted by 53BP1, a
signaling factor that impairs homologous recombination
[17–19, 42, 43]. In parallel, more than 85% of irradiationinduced DSBs in the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle
are repaired rapidly by this system [44]. Effectively, the
slow component of DSB repair, which represents ~15%
of irradiation-induced DSBs, includes homologous
recombination but also NHEJ [45]. This slow component
of DSB repair has been reported to be dependent on ATM
whilst fast DNA repair appears to be ATM-independent.
Our current data indicating the involvement of ATM in
Ku70 phosphorylation implicate ATM also in the fast
component of DSB repair. Taking into account these
findings and the accurate assessment of the DSB repair
dynamics relevant to NHEJ activity, we have here applied
three complementary methodologies (i.e. alkaline comet

assay, measurement of γ-H2AX foci and assessment of
chromosomal structural aberrations after the first cell
division), in unsynchronized cells in culture irradiated
at physiological doses. Phospho-S27-Ku70 may matche
with phospho-S2056-DNA-PKcs localization at sites of
DNA damage only transitory and early after genotoxic
stress in primary R-CLL cells (Figure 5A) while the
colocalisation with γ-H2AX was not evident in wholly
irradiated cells since pS27-Ku70 progressively increased
in nuclear area without clear large foci formation (Figure
5B and Supplementary Figure S3, upper panel). Even if
each γ-H2AX focus may theoretically correspond to one
DSBs [46], it covers the megabases of chromatin domain.
Only the high-resolution microscopy coupled with laser
microirradiation and specific cell treatments may allow
an evidencing of Ku80 smaler foci colocalisation with
some but not with all of γ-H2AX nuclear foci [47].
Experimental procedure according to this last study
(i.e. the prextraction cell treatment with cytoskeleton
buffer and RNase), allowed an evidencing of some
chromatin regions with enriched phospho-Ku70 that may
overlap with large γ-H2AX foci 30min post-irradiation
(Figure 5B), that may suggest the existence of chromatine
(active?) domains with “preferential” repair that may
deserve further characterizations. Of note, phosphoKu70 partner phospho-S2056-DNA-PKcs did not
localized into γ-H2AX or ATM foci at 2 h postirradiation
(Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B), further suggesting
an involvement of phospho-Ku70 and pS2056-DNAPKcs in fast c-NHEJ further documented here by commet
assay (Figure 6H). In parallel, both γ-H2AX (Figure 6F)
and pS1981-ATM (Supplementary Figure S3A and S3B)
foci disappeared more rapidly in pS27-S33-Ku70 than in
A27-A33-Ku70 expressing cells while the 53BP1 nuclear
labelling still persisted; data which are consistent with the
NHEJ promotion and the HR inhibition [43]. The data
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

we obtained clearly converge towards an upregulation of
DSB repair in cells expressing phospho-Ku70 resulting in
a higher level of chromosomal breaks. This upregulation
is further supported by the cell cycle checkpoint activation
and the S phase progression observed in these cells.
Concerning phosphomimetic form of Ku70, inermediate
cell responses were observed in both kinetic of γ-H2AX
foci and the number of dicentric chromosomes. For this
reason we focused other analyses on alanine- and serineform of Ku70 only. Current data indicate effectively that
phosphomimetic form of Ku70 may alter interaction of
Ku70 with specific nuclear partners (data not shown).
In light of the threshold of DSBs necessary to
trigger G2/M arrest in mammalian cells [48], our current
data indicate that mutant A27-A33-Ku70 protein may
brake DNA repair resulting in a persistence of DSBs
when compared to cells expressing phospho-Ku70.
Increased levels of dicentric chromosomes that are
the result of chromosome breaks due to misrepaired
DSBs [49], indicate that cells expressing phosphoKu70 commit more final errors in DNA repair than cells
expressing the unphosphorylatable form of Ku70. This
cytogenetic approach appears to be the most appropriate
methodology to assess the accuracy of DSB repair in
living cells compared to other techniques such as pulsefield gel electrophoresis which have limited sensitivity
at physiological doses of irradiation [50]. Cytogenetic
analysis enables the effective detection of one dicentric
chromosome that has resulted from a chromosome break
due to two DSBs after G2 release [49]. This further
emphasizes a putative role for wild type S27-S33-Ku70 in
the temporal control of DNA repair following genotoxic
stress. Accordingly, a constitutively higher level of
phospho-Ku70 protein induced by genotoxic agents
in vivo would contribute to a higher rate of DNA repair,
lower susceptibility to apoptosis and may be the source
27993

of the resistance of aggressive CLL forms to therapeutic
treatments based on DNA damaging drugs.
This form of Ku70 appears causative for the
inaccuracy of NHEJ-mediated DNA repair that warrants
further investigations. Current collaborative study through
label-free protein identification/quantification by applying
the orbital based mass spectrometry indicates a significant
difference between protein partners interacting with
Ku70 or phospho-Ku70. These partners, involved or not
(directly) in DNA repair have been immunopurified with
anti-pS27-Ku70 or anti-Ku70 clone N3H10 specific for aa
506–541 (data not shown). Interestingly, among known
non-significantly different partners we have identified
Ku80 and Ku70 it self. This may be one of explanations
why in vitro Ku heterodimer DNA-end binding does not
differ between cell sublines expressing or not phosphoKu70 (Figure 7). Thus, further identification of factors that
interact with phospho-Ku70 (and/or DNA-PK complex),
should help us to better understand the fine balance that
exists between fast and slow DNA repair that is critical
to cancer cell fates. The existence of the phospho-Ku70
specific factors is supported by the fact that 5 hours after
irradiation, A27-A33-Ku70-expressing cells exhibited a
higher proliferation rate than S27-S33-Ku70-expressing
cells. A cytoplasmic membrane association of Ku70 has
been reported for TCF [51] and for the detoxification
enzyme metalloproteinase MMP9 [52] whose expression
is under β-catenin control. Ku70 may also directly control
cell death inhibition by blocking Bax [53, 54] or Hdm2
[55]. In addition, several studies have implicated Ku70 in
DNA structural dynamics and repair through interactions
with the mismatch-repair proteins MSH6 [56], c-Myc
[57], CAF-1 [58, 59], Recq1 [60] and Werner syndrome
protein helicases [61] or heterochromatin protein HP1γ
[62]. Our identification of new site of phosphorylation
of Ku70 involving PI-3K kinase ATM opens a possible
link between the fast and slow components of DSB
DNA repair. In agreement with this, NBS1, which forms
the MRN complex necessary for ATM activation, has
already been reported as a protein interacting with Ku70
[63]. This interaction is dependent on Ku70 acetylation
and subsequent release of proapoptotic Bax from Ku70Bax complex. Thus, besides the ubiquitination, targeting
Ku70 for proteasomal degradation [55], the acetylation
was the only known post-transcriptional modification
of Ku70 affecting its biological functions. Determining
whether phospho-Ku70 is involved in these interactions
would provide new insights into the link between DNA
repair (both, HR and c-NHEJ) and apoptosis and their
pathological deregulation.
Overall presented data suggest that pKu70 could
be a critical biomarker for cancer cell sensitivity to
DNA damage response whilst it obviously may convey
genomic instability as a hallmark of cancer cells. In
agreement with this, the involvement of c-NHEJ in
chromosomal translocations associated with tumorigenesis
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

has been shown to be strikingly restricted to human cells
[64]. Depicting the molecular partners involved in fine
tuning of phospho-Ku70 dynamic, would help a further
understanding of the dysregulation of c-NHEJ pathway in
cancer cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Malignant B cell isolation and the assessment of
cell sensitivity to DNA damage-induced apoptosis
The patients enrolled in the study were diagnosed
with CLL following cytological and immunological
analyses. These patients had a Matutes score of between
4 and 5, corresponding to the immunophenotyping
of B cells with a low or absent expression of FMC7,
CD79b, monotypic kappa or lambda light chain and
expression of CD5 and CD23. CLL cell sampling was
performed at least three months after chemotherapy (if
any), excepting for one patient’s sample obtained before
and 2 h after fludarabine treatment. Patient follow-ups
were performed at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (Paris,
France) between 1998 and 2012. The clinical data are
presented in Supplementary Table S1. In accordance
with the direction of the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital
Ethics Committee (CCPPRB), all patients participating
in this study gave written informed consent. B cells
were negatively selected from fresh blood samples
using the Rosettesep B-cell enrichment cocktail
(Stemcell Biotechnologies, France) and isolated using a
ficoll density gradient. B-cells were grown at 37°C/5%
CO2 in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with hepes,
glutamine, and non-essential amino acids (Invitrogen,
France). Apoptosis resulting from DNA damage
induction and the according classification of CLL cells
were assessed as previously described [11].

grown in RPMI Glutamax medium (Life Technology,
France) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf
serum (Life Technology); Capan1 cells were grown in
same medium supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum.
ZR75.1 cell lines, U20S, HT29, A549, HepG2, MO59J
and U373 cells were grown in DMEM Glutamax (Life

grown at 37°C/5% CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium F12 (DMEM F12; Life Technologies, France)
supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma). To
introduce exogenously expressed Ku70 cDNA into cells,
the coding region of the human KU70 gene (pBS-6HisKu70) was cloned into the pcDNA 3.1 vector (pcDNAHisKu70-S27A-S33A; S27E-S33E) (Life Technologies)
and point mutations at the S27 and S33 residues were
introduced using the QuickChangeTM site-directed
mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, France) to create
the A27-A33 and E27-E33 mutants. These mutants were
further used to construct the replica­tive pEBVsiKu70CAGKu70(R/S27-S33), pEBVsiKu70-CAGKu70(R/A27-A33), or
pEBVsiKu70-CAGKu70(R/E27-E33), plasmids, respectively.
pEBV-CAGKu70 constructs (wild-type or mutant
forms) were transfected into ZR75.1 cells using Amaxa
Nucleofector according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Lonza, France). Stable populations of cells expressing
either an exogenous wild type or mutant Ku70 were
established under hygromycin selection (250 μg/mL, PAA
Laboratories GmbH, Austria). ZR75.1 transfected cells
were then maintained in culture in DMEM GlutaMAX
medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% of
heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and non-essential amino
acids in the presence of 125 μg/mL hygromycin B.

ethynyl deoxyuridine (EdU) was detected in untreated
or irradiated cells at different timepoints post-irradiation
(10Gy) using the SORP LSR-II analyzer (BD Biosciences)
with filters B530-30A for Alexafluor 488 or U450-50A
for DAPI acquisition and subsequent analysis by FlowJo
software.

Cytogenetic analysis
Metaphase chromosomes were prepared as
described previously [65]. Briefly, unexposed or 48 h
postirradiated (4Gy) cells were treated with colcemide
(60ng/ml, 90min) followed by 25 min of hypotonic
treatment (75mM KCl). The cells were gradually fixed
in methanol/acetic acid (3/1, vol/vol). Metaphase
chromosome spreads were hybridized with a cyanine3telomeric PNA probe (DAKO, France) followed by
hybridization with FITC-Pan centromeric DNA probe
(Cambio, Cambridge, UK). After chromosomal DNA
staining with DAPI, fluorescence microscope (Nikon
FXA, Kingston, UK) image acquisition and analysis
was achieved using QUIPS CGH Software (Vysis,
France). To asses chromosomal break counts, the
following chromosomal structural aberrations were
scored: dicentrics (dic), centric and acentric rings (r), and
chromosome breaks (csb). Dic and r were assumed to be
the result of two breaks and csb of one break.

Comet assay
To assess the kinetics of global chromosomal
(single- and double-strand) DNA repair in living cells,
comet assays were performed under alkaline conditions
as previously described [66]. Briefly, 1–2 × 104
untreated or irradiated (4Gy) cells, after an indicated
period postirradiation, were embedded in low melting
point agarose (0.7% w/vol) and deposited on prepared
slides precoated with two layers of agarose (1%, w/
vol), and coverslipped. After 10 min incubation on
ice, the coverslips were removed and the slides were
placed in lysis solution (NaCl 2.5M, sodium lauryl
sarcosine 0.1% (w/vol), EDTA 0.1M ph 8.0, Tris 10
mM; pH 10), overnight at 4°C. After lysis, the slides
were neutralized in Tris-HCl buffer (0.4M, ph7.4) over
three 10 min incubations. Prior to electrophoresis and
to achieve chromosomal DNA unwinding, slides were
placed in alkaline electrophoresis buffer (EDTA 1mM,
NaOH 300 mM, pH13.0) for 30 min. Electrophoresis
was performed at a constant 300 mA for 30 min.
After neutralization (Tris 0.4 M, pH 7.4) and ethidium
bromide staining, comets were assessed using an
automatized Zeiss Axio (Jena, Germany) fluorescent
microscope and acquisition Metasystems following
analysis by Metafer4 software (MetaSystems Gmbh,
Altlussheim, Germany).

Analysis of the cell cycle by flow cytometry
Cells were resuspended at a density of 106/ml in PBS
with 5% FCS, fixed in 3 volumes of 70% ethanol (50%
final concentration) and then incubated for 30 min at 4°C.
The cells were subsequently centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5
min at 4°C and resuspended in buffer containing 0.294 g
citric acid, 0.716 g disodium sulfate, 10 ml distilled water
and 30 ml HBSS ph 7.8 for 15 min at room temperature.
After the addition of 1ml PBS/5% FCS, the cells were
centrifuged at 1200 rpm for 5 min and washed 3 times
in HBSS. The cells were treated with RNase A (DNase
free) at a final concentration of 0.3 mg/ml in HBSS and
PI was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml. PI
fluorescence was acquired on a SORP LSR-II analyzer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, ) with log acquisition
(filter B685_35-A). Data were analyzed using FlowJo
software (Treestar, Ashland, OR). S phase progression
was assessed using “Click-it” assay (Invitrogen) according

xCELLigence® instrument Real-Time Cell
Analyzer (RTCA) (ACEA Biosciences, San Diego, CA),
offers a means to monitor cellular responses in real time,
without exogenous labellings, through impedance-based
technology. The E-plates (specific 96 well microplates
covered with micro-electrodes, ACEA Biosciences),
allow the measures of electrical impedance that are
relevant of dynamic monitoring of cell viability and
cytotoxicity as well as cell proliferation. The usefulness
of this system in cell biology and compatibility with
ionizing irradiation were reported elsewhere [67]. The
background of the E-plates was determined in 50 μl of
cell culture medium and subsequently 150 μl of each
cell suspension was added (3x103 cells/well). Cells
were incubated for 30 min at 37°C and E-plates were
placed in a RTCA instrument. Cells were grown for at
least 24 h, with impedance measurements performed
every 5 min for 6 h (adhesion phase), then every 15
min (proliferation phase). After at least 24 h, cells were
irradiated at 4 Gy and were monitored again every 5 min
for 6 h (early effects), and then every 10 min for at least
24 h (late effects). Cell index (CI) raw data values were
calculated by Zi-Z0 [Ohm]/15[Ohm]; where Z0 is the
background resistance and Zi is the individual time point
of resistance. A normalized cell index was also calculated
by the software at the selected normalization timepoint,
chosen as the time just before irradiation.

Immunoprecipitation
For immunoprecipitation assays, anti-Ku70,
anti-Ku80, anti-pS27-Ku70, anti-S1981-ATM or antiS2056-DNA-PKcsantibodies were coupled to magnetic
anti-mouse IgG Dynabeads (Life Technologies) or BioEstapor microspheres anti-mouse IgG (Merck Millipore),
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Protein extracts
were incubated at 4°C for 2 h under gentle agitation of
these beads in 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl,
5% glycerol, 2, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol,
0.5% nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor mixture tablets
(Complete Mini, Roche Diagnostics), trypsin-like

a 2D-gel rehydration buffer (see below) and stored at
−80°C until use.

Antibodies, western blotting analysis and

Western blotting and fluorescent immunostaining
were performed as previously described [11, 62]. AntiKu70 (N3H10), anti-Ku80 (111), anti-DNA-PKcs (18–
2 + 25–4 + 42-psc) antibodies were purchased from
Neomarkers (Thermo Scientific, France). Antibodies
against phosphorylated pS15-p53 and, pS2056-DNAPKcs (ab18192) were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology (Ozyme, France) and Abcam (Cambridge,
UK), respectively. XRCC4 antibody (ab 145) was
also obtained from Abcam. The Ku7390 peptide with
the sequence CENLEA-pS-GDYKY was synthesized
by Biosyntan GmbH (Berlin, Germany) and used
for BALB/c mouse immunization and production of
monoclonal antibodies against phosphorylated pS27Ku70. Hybridoma cells were generated by fusing spleen

Mass spectrometry
Immunoprecipitated Ku70 protein from R-CLL
lymphocytes was separated by 2D-PAGE and individual
Ku70 spots (n°1, 2, 3 and 4) were excised from 2D-gels
stained with Sypro Ruby (Life Technology), processed by
tryptic in-gel digestion and analyzed by mass spectrometry
(MS). Peptide samples were spun at 18000g, desalted
using a C18 ZipTip (Merck-Millipore), according to the
supplier’s instructions and analyzed by MALDI-TOF
MS in a positive polarity mode (AB Sciex, France). The
presence of one phosphopeptide was clearly evidenced
from spot n°2. MS/MS and MSn spectra from the
phosphopeptide were obtained using an LTQ linear ion
trap (Thermo Scientific, France).
