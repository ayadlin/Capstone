Glioblastoma Survival in the United States Improved After
Food and Drug Administration Approval of Bevacizumab
A Population-Based Analysis
Derek R. Johnson, MD; Heather E. Leeper, MD; and Joon H. Uhm, MD

BACKGROUND: Bevacizumab received US Food and Drug Administration approval for use in recurrent glioblastoma based on promising radiographic response data, but without clear evidence that it prolongs survival. A population-based analysis was conducted to
determine whether bevacizumab approval was associated with improved glioblastoma survival in the United States. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data were used to compare survival of glioblastoma patients who died in
2006, 2008 (both prior to approval of bevacizumab), and 2010 (after approval of bevacizumab). RESULTS: The SEER database contained 1715 patients with glioblastoma who died in 2006, 1924 who died in 2008, and 1968 who died in 2010 who met study inclusion
criteria. Median survival was 8 months for those who died in 2006, 7 months in 2008, and 9 months in 2010. The difference in survival
between 2008 (pre-bevacizumab) and 2010 (post-bevacizumab) was highly significant. This difference is unlikely to be due to
improvements in supportive care in this short interval, because there was no significant difference (P 5.4440) between patients who
died in 2006 versus those who died in 2008. Between 2008 and 2010, a statistically significant improvement in survival was seen in
all age groups except those patients aged 18 to 39 years. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who died of glioblastoma in 2010 had lived with
disease significantly longer than patients who died in 2008. The most likely explanation for this change is the approval and use of
bevacizumab for progressive glioblastoma, indicating that at a population level, treatment strategies involving bevacizumab prolong

INTRODUCTION
Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite recent advances in treatment, tumor recurrence
after initial therapy is inevitable and typically leads to death within a matter of months. Treatment options at the time of
glioblastoma recurrence have traditionally been associated with only modest response rates and survival times. Bevacizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A, was approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in recurrent glioblastoma in May 2009,1 and subsequently has been widely used
for this indication in the United States.
The accelerated FDA approval of bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma was based on the results of 2 single-arm
trials, AVF3708g2 and National Cancer Institute (NCI) 06-C-0064E.3 Both trials showed that bevacizumab was well tolerated and associated with previously unprecedented rates of radiographically defined tumor response, but by nature of
their single-arm designs, these trials could not definitively demonstrate that bevacizumab use positively impacted patient
survival. To date, no large placebo-controlled trials of bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma have been performed, leaving open the question of to what extent bevacizumab therapy prolongs survival. Instead, recent clinical trials have focused
on the efficacy of bevacizumab as part of up-front therapy for newly diagnosed glioblastoma,4,5 in combination with other
treatments in recurrent glioblastoma,6-10 and in patient populations such as children,11 or adults with World Health Organization grade III glioma.12 However, the initial optimism regarding bevacizumab in treatment of glioblastoma has
been tempered by concerns that radiographic response to treatment may in some cases simply be “pseudoresponse,” a
decrease in contrast-enhancement without a decrease of tumor activity as the tumor assumes a more invasive phenotype.13-15 These concerns were magnified after the FDA revoked its previous approval of bevacizumab for metastatic

breast cancer.16 As is the case for glioblastoma, FDA approval of bevacizumab for metastatic breast cancer had
been originally granted on an accelerated basis following
promising early data but without clear demonstration that
it improved patient survival.
This study was undertaken to evaluate whether glioblastoma survival in the United States, as recorded by the
cancer registries comprising the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, increased following the FDA approval of bevacizumab. Previous SEER
studies have successfully demonstrated an improvement
in population-level survival after the FDA approval of
temozolomide for newly diagnosed glioblastoma.17,18 We
hypothesized that patients who died in 2010 would have
lived significantly longer with disease than patients who
died in 2008, because patients who died in 2010 would
have had access to bevacizumab therapy. Further, we
hypothesized that survival times of patients who died in
2006 and 2008 would have been similar, indicating that
incremental improvements in supportive care, surgery,
and radiation in the absence of novel therapeutic options
were insufficient to improve glioblastoma survival over a
2-year period.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Identification and Selection

The SEER Program currently collects cancer incidence and
survival data on 18 geographic areas in the United States
which together represent approximately 28% of the US
population. We requested and received permission from the
NCI to use the most recent SEER data set, released April
2013.19 The SEER data was then used to identify patients
18 years of age and older diagnosed with glioblastoma from
2000 to 2010. For the purposes of this study, glioblastoma
was indicated by International Classification of Diseases for
Oncology, 3rd Edition (ICD-O-3) codes 9440/3
“Glioblastoma, NOS,” 9441/3 “Giant cell glioblastoma,”
and 9442/3 “Gliosarcoma.” Additional inclusion criteria
included microscopic confirmation of disease, actively followed patients, known age at diagnosis, and case inclusion
in the SEER research database. Exclusion criteria included
patients identified only at autopsy, patients alive without
known survival time, and patients with other cancer diagnoses prior to glioblastoma. Once all SEER exclusion criteria
had been applied, the analysis group was limited to patients
who died in 2006, 2008, or 2010. Figure 1 is a flowchart of
the cohort selection process.
Because bevacizumab is much more frequently used
at the time of progression than at initial diagnosis, year of
3490

death rather than year of diagnosis was selected as the
proxy for potential bevacizumab exposure. Bevacizumab
was approved in May 2009, and thus patients who died in
2008 and 2010 were considered to have been treated in
the pre-bevacizumab and post-bevacizumab eras, respectively. Chemotherapy information is not included in
SEER data, so bevacizumab use could not be determined
on an individual patient basis. In order to determine
whether a statistically significant change in populationlevel survival could occur in a 2-year period which did not
include the approval of a novel glioblastoma therapy, survival of patients who died in 2006 was compared to
patients who died in 2008. This study was determined to
be exempt from review by the Mayo Clinic Institutional
Review Board, because it used only publicly available deidentified patient data.
Outcome and Statistical Analysis

The primary outcome of interest for this study was survival time, measured as a whole number of completed
months of life from initial diagnosis to death, for patients
who died during each year of interest. In SEER data, an
individual patient survival time of 6 months could indicate a survival time between 6 months exactly and 1 day
prior to 7 months of survival. From a population perspective, a median survival time of 6 months should be considered as more closely approximating 6.5 months than 6
months exactly given this variability.
SEER*Stat software20 was used to generate case listing data containing patient-specific demographic information such as age at diagnosis and treatment
information such as whether radiation therapy was
administered as part of the initial treatment plan and
extent of initial surgical intervention. Age at time of diagnosis was subdivided into the age groups 18 to 39 years,
40 to 54 years, 55 to 69 years, and 70 or more years of
age. All other demographic variables were taken directly
from the SEER data set. A composite race/ethnicity variable was created dichotomizing patients as “White NonHispanic” and “All Other.” Radiation therapy use was
dichotomized into patients confirmed to have received
radiation therapy regardless of modality and patients not
confirmed to have received therapy (whether it was not
recommended, recommended but refused, or radiation
status was unknown). Initial surgical intervention type
was recoded into gross total resection (GTR), all other
surgery, and no surgery. Patients who did not receive surgery were diagnosed with and treated for presumed glioblastoma during life but histologic confirmation was not
obtained until autopsy. In order to evaluate survival in a

Differences in survival distributions between 2006 and
2008, 2006 and 2010, and 2008 and 2010 were evaluated
with Mann-Whitney U tests, given non-Gaussian survival
time distributions. As an exploratory measure, the logrank test was used to evaluate survival comparisons that
were not significant in Mann-Whitney U analysis. Baseline demographic and treatment characteristics of the
death year groups were evaluated with the chi-squared test
for categorical outcomes and the Mann-Whitney U test
for continuous outcomes with non-Gaussian distributions. Subpopulations of interest were selected for survival
evaluation based on previous data demonstrating clear

RESULTS
In total, 5607 adult patients with glioblastoma identified in
SEER met criteria for inclusion in survival analysis. By year,
1715 patients (30.6%) died in 2006, 1924 patients (34.3%)
died in 2008, and 1968 patients (35.1%) died in 2010.
Patient demographic characteristics for patients who died in
each year of interest are displayed in Table 1. The 3 cohorts
were demographically similar aside from years of diagnosis.
Details of initial tumor treatment are shown in Table 2. The
rate of GTR fell from 2006 to 2008 and from 2008 to 2010,
with a corresponding increase in other surgery types.
The median survival time at death was 8 months
(interquartile range [IQR] 5 13) for the group as a whole, 8
months (IQR 5 12) for those that died in 2006, 7 months
(IQR 5 13) for those who died in 2008, and 9 months
(IQR 5 14) for those who died in 2010. The difference in
survival between 2006 and 2008 was not statistically significant (P 5 .4440), whereas the differences in survival
between patients who would not have had access to bevacizumab (2006 and 2008 patient groups) and those who
would have bevacizumab access (2010 group) was highly
significant (each P < .0001). Figure 2 displays the proportion of patients alive with disease at monthly intervals up to
24 months before death in 2006, 2008, or 2010.

subgroup of those aged 18 to 39 were alive with disease 32
months or longer prior to death, whereas in 2010, the

longest-lived 25% were alive with disease 41 months or longer prior to death. The difference in survival between 2008
and 2010 in this age subgroup was statistically significant
(P 5 .0342) when analyzed with the log-rank test, which is
more sensitive to differences in groups at later time points.
Race/ethnicity was analyzed as White Non-Hispanic versus
All Others, given the high proportion of patients falling into
the White Non-Hispanic group. Both groups saw an
increase in median survival from 7 months in 2008 to 9
months in 2010. This improvement was significant in the
White Non-Hispanic group and trended toward significance in the All Other group.
Among patient groups defined by initial surgical
treatment, median survival was longest in the patient
group that underwent GTR, shorter in patients who
underwent other surgeries, and shortest in the group that
was treated without tissue diagnosis during life. The GTR
surgical subgroup was the only demographic or
treatment-defined patient subgroup in which survival significantly increased between 2006 and 2008. Survival in
the GTR subgroup did not increase significantly between
2008 and 2010 (P 5 .4561), although it did approach significance in log-rank testing (P 5 .0594). During this
same time period, survival significantly improved in the
“Other Surgery” group, and a strong trend toward
improvement was observed in the group in which tissue
diagnosis was obtained postmortem.

survival was 13 months in 2006, 14 months in 2008, and
15 months in 2010, although only the change in the latter
time interval was statistically significant. In patients who did
not qualify for the Stupp Cohort, median survival was identical at 4 months in both 2008 and 2010, but a statistically
significant improvement over this interval was driven by an
increase in relatively long-term survivors. In 2008, the
longest-lived 25% of patients not qualifying for the Stupp
Cohort were alive for 8 months or longer, while in 2010,
the longest-lived 25% were alive 11 months or longer.
DISCUSSION
In summary, our analysis of the SEER registry indicates that
following FDA approval of bevacizumab for treatment of
recurrent glioblastoma in May 2009, overall survival for
patients with glioblastoma improved. In this analysis,
patients with glioblastoma who died in 2010 (and who had
access to bevacizumab) had lived with disease significantly
longer than patients who died in 2008 (before FDA approval
of bevacizumab). This improvement in survival was not limited to a narrowly defined patient group; all adult patient age
groups appeared to benefit. The magnitude of the improvement in survival between 2008 and 2010, although modest,
was comparable to the 2.5-month improvement in median
survival that led to FDA approval of temozolomide for
newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Because SEER does not contain information about chemotherapy usage, chemotherapy
practice patterns in each year of interest must be inferred.
Prior to FDA approval of bevacizumab for recurrent glioblastoma, its use was limited to clinical trials and off-label
therapy. After FDA approval, bevacizumab was enthusiastically received into clinical practice. Although not all patients
with recurrent glioblastoma receive bevacizumab therapy, at
a minimum its use is almost universally considered in this
clinical setting. Thus, this analysis does not provide a true
comparison of survival in patients with and without bevacizumab. Instead, it compares population outcomes in a time
when physicians had the option of using bevacizumab in
clinically selected patients to an earlier time in which they
did not have this option.
Patients with glioblastoma receive multidisciplinary
care, including treatment by oncologists, neurologists,
neurosurgeons, and radiation oncologists. Although each
of these fields is constantly advancing, the approval of bevacizumab was the change most likely to have affected glioblastoma survival between 2008 and 2010. A previous
SEER analysis of glioblastoma survival demonstrated a
long period without any notable improvement, despite
presumed incremental improvement in supportive care,
surgical technique, and radiation therapy methods.23
3494

More recently, SEER studies demonstrated that survival
improved following FDA approval of temozolomide,
which was last chemotherapy approved for use in glioblastoma prior to bevacizumab approval.17,18
The longer survival observed for patients who had
access to bevacizumab (2010 group) compared with those
who did not have access (2008 group) was unlikely to be
related to improvements in supportive care over this 2year interval. In this regard, we observed no statistically
significant improvement in survival between patients who
died in 2006 and those who died in 2008, a time interval
equal to that in which the significant change between
2008 and 2010 was documented. In fact, median survival
was 1 month greater in 2006 than in 2008, a finding that
likely reflects the granularity of the SEER data more than
a clinically meaningful change, because the difference was
not statistically significant and the survival curves for these
years in Figure 2 are closely apposed.
This study provides the strongest evidence to date
that bevacizumab therapy improves survival in patients
with glioblastoma. A variety of factors have made this
survival benefit difficult to demonstrate in clinical trials. First, clinical trials of bevacizumab in recurrent
glioblastoma have often been confounded by crossover
to bevacizumab at the time of tumor progression, or
they have compared 2 bevacizumab-containing regimens. Most brain tumor clinicians believe, based on
clinical experience, that bevacizumab therapy is beneficial to patients with progressive glioblastoma, and thus
at this point a randomized trial of bevacizumab versus
placebo without crossover would be difficult, if not
impossible, to conduct in countries in which bevacizumab is readily available. In addition, it had been
hypothesized that the addition of bevacizumab to radiation and temozolomide at the time of glioblastoma diagnosis would prolong survival relative to radiation and
temozolomide alone, and thus demonstrate the survival
benefit of bevacizumab without the need to conduct a
randomized trial in the progressive glioblastoma setting. This hypothesis led to 2 large international
randomized placebo-controlled trials, neither of which
demonstrated an overall survival benefit of bevacizumab in this setting.4,5 On the basis of the negative
newly-diagnosed glioblastoma trials and the positive
results of this analysis, it is not possible to discern
whether bevacizumab is equally effective in the newly
diagnosed and progressive glioblastoma setting, or
selectively effective in progressive glioblastoma.
A limitation of this analysis is that SEER does not
include patient-level data such as performance status and
Cancer

MGMT methylation status,24 which are of great importance in patients with progressive brain tumors. There are
no data to suggest that these characteristics changed on a
population level over the period considered by this analysis,
and thus they should not confound year-to-year comparisons. Furthermore, some SEER-reported data are not fully
objective, and may confuse subgroup comparisons if standards change over time. For example, GTR in SEER is based
on surgeon report. Between 2006 and 2010, the rate of
reported GTR fell steadily, and the GTR patient subgroup
was the only demographic or treatment subgroup in which
survival improved between 2006 and 2008. It is unlikely
that surgical progress truly resulted in a lower GTR rate.
Instead, it is probable that surgeons became more circumspect in estimating extent of resection as postoperative magnetic resonance imaging became more routine, and earlier
GTR groups contain higher proportions of patients who
truly had residual disease after surgery than later GTR
groups. These issues preclude the identification of clear
patient subsets that do and do not benefit from bevacizumab treatment. Further studies, ideally prospective trials,
will be needed to inform patient selection.
In conclusion, FDA approval of bevacizumab was
associated with a statistically significant improvement in
glioblastoma survival in the United States. Although the
observed increase in survival was modest on a population
basis, this analysis likely underestimates the change in median survival seen in the subpopulation of patients clinically selected for bevacizumab therapy. Although a causeand-effect relationship between bevacizumab use and
increased survival cannot be definitively proven in a retrospective population-based analysis, this study strongly
suggests that bevacizumab is a useful treatment for recurrent glioblastoma, and that the initial radiographic
response data that led to FDA approval of bevacizumab
for recurrent glioblastoma successfully predicted a benefit
in overall survival for this patient population.
