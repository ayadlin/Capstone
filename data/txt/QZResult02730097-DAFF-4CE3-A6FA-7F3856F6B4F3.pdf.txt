ABSTRACT
Idelalisib is a targeted agent that potently inhibits PI3Kδ which is exclusively
expressed in hematological cells. Bendamustine is a well-tolerated cytotoxic
alkylating agent which has been extensively used for treatment of chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (CLL). Both these agents are FDA-approved for CLL. To increase the
potency of idelalisib and bendamustine, we tested their combination in primary
CLL lymphocytes. While each compound alone produced a moderate response,
combination at several concentrations resulted in synergistic cytotoxicity. Idelalisib
enhanced the bendamustine-mediated DNA damage/repair response, indicated by
the phosphorylation of ATM, Chk2, and p53. Each drug alone activated γH2AX but
combination treatment further increased the expression of this DNA damage marker.
Compared with the control, idelalisib treatment decreased global RNA synthesis,
resulting in a decline of early-response and short-lived MCL1 transcripts. In concert,
there was a decline in total Mcl-1 protein in CLL lymphocytes. Isogenic mouse
embryonic fibroblasts lacking MCL1 had higher sensitivity to bendamustine alone or
in combination compared to MCL1 proficient cells. Collectively, these data indicate
that bendamustine and idelalisib combination therapy should be investigated for
treating patients with CLL.

INTRODUCTION

As described above, PI3K delta isoform is
pivotal in the BCR axis [1] and is selectively blocked
by idelalisib [2]. Idelalisib promotes apoptosis in CLL
by disrupting molecular pathways related to BCR
signaling. Furthermore, idelalisib blocks signals from
the microenvironment, tumor cell and microenvironment
interactions, and mitigates pseudo-emperipolesis [3-6].
Clinically, as a single agent during phase I investigations,
the drug has been well-tolerated and has prolonged
survival of patients with CLL [2]. In combination with
rituximab, during phase II clinical trial, the efficacy trend
was maintained and this resulted in approval of the drug
for relapsed/refractory CLL disease [1, 2, 7, 8].
In the front-line setting, the idelalisib and rituximab
combination was tested for older patients with CLL
[9]. Similarly for another study, treatment-naïve CLL
patients were treated with idelalisib for two months as
monotherapy followed by combination with ofatumumab

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a
malignancy that is driven by active B-cell receptor
(BCR) pathway. The primary BCR down-stream network
includes two pivotal enzymes, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase
and phosphatidyl inositol three kinase (PI3K). Both
BTK and PI3K isoform delta are selectively expressed
in hematopoietic cells specifically normal and malignant
B-cells such as CLL lymphocytes. This exclusive
expression provided an impetus to design potent and
selective inhibitors of these two proteins. Ibrutinib, a
BTK poison and idelalisib a PI3K delta antagonist were
tested in CLL and demonstrated on-target effect during
preclinical experimentations and efficacy during clinical
trials. Both drugs were FDA approved for patients with
CLL.

[10]. In both these studies, responses were observed
however with a toxicity profile which was much worse
than what was observed in the relapsed/refractory disease.
The toxicity was identified as immune-mediated and hence
was more pronounced in front-line treatment [10, 11].
From phase I, phase II in previously treated CLL,
and phase II in newly-diagnosed CLL, a few points
emerged. First, while the drug was well-tolerated during
earlier studies, in treatment naïve patients, there was
unacceptable toxicity profile. Second, responses were
mostly partial and complete remissions were limited.
Third, in both cohort of patients (previously untreated
or treated), similar to other BCR pathway antagonists,
there was egression of CLL cells from lymph node which
remained in peripheral blood. Finally, there is a need to
combine idelalisib with CLL-specific agents that may
result in deeper responses without much untoward toxicity.
Chlorambucil,
cyclophosphamide,
and
bendamustine are three alkylating agents that have been
used for decades for treatment of CLL. Of these three,
regarding potency in the clinic, the cyclophosphamide
is the strongest, followed by bendamustine, and
chlorambucil. However, cyclophosphamide results in high
untoward toxicity, a feature not favorable to combine with
idelalisib. Bendamustine not only possesses alkylating
agent properties but is also well-tolerated and FDA
approved for patients with CLL along with established
treatment recommendations. [12, 13].
Previously, we have demonstrated utility of
bendamustine in preclinical setting for primary CLL
cells and shown synergistic or additive interactions with
fludarabine [14]. Importantly, both p53 positive and
p53 mutated CLL responded similarly to bendamustine
[15, 16]. The mechanism of CLL lymphocyte death
elicited by bendamustine was due to DNA damage and
repair response. Because PI3K inhibitors, including
idelalisib also result in DNA damage, we postulated
that combination of idelalisib to bendamustine may
result in additive or synergistic cytotoxicity due to
enhanced DNA damage. When used alone, bendamustine
was more active in suspension cultures of CLL but
stromal microenvironment protected CLL cells from
bendamustine-mediated cytotoxicity [14]. One of the
primary pathways of microenvironment-induced CLL
cell survival is BCR axis that includes the PI3K/Akt
cassette. Because idelalisib mitigates the BCR nexus, we
hypothesized that microenvironment-induced resistance
to bendamustine cell death of CLL lymphocyte may be
abrogated with idelalisib addition.
In the current project, we tested that idelalisibmediated suppression of BCR signaling would sensitize
CLL cells to bendamustine, and this mechanism-based
combination may lead to a synergistic interaction. We
evaluated the cytotoxicity induced by idelalisib or
bendamustine alone or in combination in primary CLL
cells and the impact of this combination on DNA damage

response and Bcl-2 family survival protein levels which
are regulated by PI3K/Akt pathway. Our data demonstrate
that this combination is synergistic, and we suggest a
mechanism by which idelalisib increased the cytotoxicity
of bendamustine.

RESULTS
Idelalisib and bendamustine combination is
synergistic
Treatment of primary CLL cells with idelalisib
alone (Figure 1A), bendamustine alone (Figure 1B),
or the combination for 24 hours (Figure 1C; n = 9)
revealed that single agent idelalisib induced moderate
but statistically significant cytotoxicity (i.e., apoptosis)
in a dose-dependent manner, ranging from 4% to 16%
(p = 0.002 to < 0.0001 for each concentration). Whereas
single agent bendamustine resulted in 6%-33% (p =
0.002 to < 0.0001 for each concentration) cell death.
Combination of idelalisib and bendamustine at clinically
relevant concentrations resulted in 13% to 49% of
apoptosis (p = < 0.0001 for each concentration). At each
drug concentration, compared to single agent apoptotic
response, there was an increase in the level of cell death
when both drugs were combined together.
This dose-response profile led us to investigate
whether idelalisib and bendamustine combination could
be synergistic combination. To test this, we plotted the
apoptotic values obtained from Figure 1C and analyzed
by the median-effect method using CalcuSyn software.
The calculated combination index (CI) was < 0.8 for
all the samples (except for 1 sample treated with low
concentrations of both drugs) indicating synergy (Figure
1D).

DNA damage response was enhanced with
combination of idelalisib and bendamustine
Bendamustine is an alkylating agent known to
induce DNA damage response. γH2AX is a prominent
marker of DNA damage response [17] and could be
measured using flow-cytometry assay as shown in
the plots (Figure 2A). CLL primary cells were either
untreated or treated with idelalisib alone, bendamustine
alone or combination. Control i.e. DMSO only treated
CLL lymphocytes showed a minimal positivity for
γH2AX. Compared to the control, single agent idelalisib
and single agent bendamustine demonstrated increased
γH2AX. Furthermore, when both drugs were incubated
simultaneously, the combination treatment significantly
enhanced DNA damage response, according to both flow
cytometry (Figure 2B) and immunoblot analysis (Figure
2C). When CLL primary cells were stimulated with αIgM,

there was a slight decrease in DNA damage response
(Figure 2C).
We further evaluated the effects of these agents on
other proteins involved in DNA damage/repair signaling
pathways. Compared to the control, bendamustine
alone increased phosphorylation of ATM(Ser1981)
and Chk2(Thr68), an effect that was further enhanced
by combination treatment. Additionally, bendamustine
alone and in combination with idelalisib resulted in
stabilization of p53 protein, marked by phosphorylation
of p53(Ser15). Overall, these observations indicate that
idelalisib enhanced the DNA-damage response elicited by
bendamustine.

are being depleted with idelalisib treatment. In CLL,
MCL1 and BCL2 are the members of the BCL2 family
antiapoptotic proteins, [19]. Our results showed that,
in unstimulated cells, idelalisib treatment significantly
decreased MCL1 mRNA expression (by 30%); Of
note, MCL1 mRNA expression was increased by IgM
stimulation, but decreased again with idelalisib treatment
(Figure 3B; upper panel). In contrast, BCL2 mRNA
expression did not change significantly (Figure 3B; lower
panel).

In order to examine if the transcription results
obtained above are in conjunction with translation, we

primary cells from one patient sample (CLL599) was
either unstimulated or stimulated with αIgM and treated
with 5 µM of idelalisib for increasing time points (30 min,

out to evaluate Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 proteins. Additional

Consistent with previous studies of PI3Kα and β
isoforms, [18] we found that idelalisib-treated cells had
significantly less global RNA synthetic capacity than
control cells (47%-71% decrease; n = 4; Figure 3A).

samples (CLL525 (24 h), CLL103 (24 h) and CLL103
(48 h)) were evaluated for the same proteins. Consistent
with our mRNA data, idelalisib treatment decreased Mcl-1
protein but not Bcl-2 protein levels (Figure 4A).

report where combination of idelalisib at 0.5 µM resulted
in sensitization of CLL cells to bendamustine (25 µM)
induced cell death [15]. Mechanistically, we provide two
actions of idelalisib to enhance bendamustine’s cytotoxic
effect in CLL lymphocytes; first is an impact on DNA
damage and repair response and second is a depletion of
Mcl-1 protein. Down-regulation of CD69, a biomarker
in CLL, by idelalisib has been previously shown to be
responsible for sensitization of CLL cells to bendamustine
[15].
Bendamustine is an established alkylating agent
resulting in double strand breaks. It is 4-{5- [bis(2chloroethyl)amino]-1-methyl-2-bezimidazolyl} butyric
acid hydrochloride. The nitrogen mustard group of
bendamustine is similar to that in chlorambucil [12, 21].
However, randomized study comparing chlorambucil
to bendamustine suggested increased overall response
rate with bendamustine [22]. Nitrogen mustard induced
damage results in monoadducts, biadducts, and intra- and
interstrand cross-links in DNA. As a consequence of this
damage response, as expected, bendamustine resulted in
induction of gammaH2AX (Figure 2A) along with other
hallmark features such as Chk2 phosphorylation (Figure
2B). Paradoxically, and not expected, treatment of CLL
cells to idelalisib alone also resulted in initiation of DNA
damage response (Figure 2A and 2B and unpublished
data). Additionally, in combination with bendamustine,
idelalisib resulted in stabilization of p53 protein, marked
by phosphorylation of p53(Ser15), Chk2 phosphorylation,
and induction of gammaH2AX; all markers of DNA
damage. Phosphorylation of p53, Chk2, and H2AX are
mediated through active ATM. [14, 23, 24] It is worthy to
mention that none of the patient samples studied had 11q
or 17p deletion, the sites for ATM and p53, respectively.
The Mcl-1 molecule [25] is an important and
bonafide prosurvival protein for CLL. [26] However, as we
found in our study, Mcl-1 has been shown to be involved
in DNA damage and repair. [27] Other investigators
have reported that cytotoxic DNA-damaging agents
that cause an early apoptosis response lead to enhanced
MCL1 gene expression in a p53-independent manner. [2730] Particularly, Mcl-1 is linked to regulating cell-cycle
progression and is partially mediated through PCNA,
interactions with CDK1, and ATR-dependent activation
of Chk1 following DNA damage. [31-33] Overall, Mcl1 is highly overexpressed in many human cancers, is
manipulated by malignant cells to escape apoptosis
regulation, and has a unique role in the DNA damage
response.
Mcl-1 is a cytosolic protein and in this location
it has been established to inhibit endogenous or druginduced apoptosis. During DNA damage response, it
is translocated to nucleus [27, 33-35]. Nuclear Mcl-1
interacts with many DNA repair/damage proteins such as
H2AX, Nbs1, Ku70, and co-localizes with 53BP1 and is
involved in homologous recombination pathway [35].

Effect of single agent bendamustine and in
combination with idelalisib on Mcl-1 expression
Single agent bendamustine also depleted MCL1
mRNA levels in primary CLL cells (n = 8) however not
to the extent of idelalisib induced depletion tested in the
same samples (Figure 5A). When the protein levels were
evaluated with bendamustine and bendamustine and
idelalisib combination, in both unstimulated and αIgM
stimulated cells (24 h and 48 h) there was no marked
changes in Mcl-1 protein levels (Figure 5B). On same
note, there were no significant changes in BCL2 mRNA
(Supplemental Figure 1) or protein levels (Figure 5B).
Quantitation of immunoblots for Mcl-1 protein revealed
that although single agent bendamustine does not alter
the Mcl-1 protein levels, this agent in combination with
idelalisib does significantly enhance the depletion of this
short-lived protein (Figure 5C).

Impact of Mcl-1 loss on bendamustine and
combination-induced cytotoxicity in MEFs
Mcl-1, an anti-apoptotic protein of Bcl-2 family is
considered important for CLL cell survival. In addition,
BCR activation enhances Mcl-1 protein levels and
inhibition of BCR signaling with kinase inhibitors deplete
Mcl-1. Consistently, our current results demonstrate that
idelalisib inhibits Mcl-1 transcript and protein levels, with
no differential effect with bendamustine. To directly assess
the role of Mcl-1 in bendamustine-induced cytotoxicity,
we tested the apoptotic response of isogenic MEFs
(Supplemental Figures 2 and 3) treated with idelalisib,
bendamustine, or combination. Bendamustine- (p = 0.021)
or combination-treated (p = 0.017) MEFs lacking MCL1
had significantly higher apoptotic cells compared to wildtype MEFs (Figure 6); indicating that the combination
regimen potently downregulates Mcl-1 and thus enhance
the apoptosis in CLL cells. This differential effect was not
observed with idelalisib (p = 0.478).

DISCUSSION
Bendamustine alone showed a dose- and timedependent cytotoxicity of quiescent CLL lymphocytes
(Figure 1B). The primary mechanism of cell death is
damage of DNA, genotoxic stress, and apoptosis [14,
20]. While idelalisib-induced apoptosis was minor
(Figure 1A), the couplet of bendamustine and idelalisib
resulted in synergistic combination at many different
concentrations (Figure 1D). This is in concert with a prior

In addition to Mcl-1, several other pro and antisurvival members of the Bcl-2 family have been shown
to participate in DNA repair. Pro-apoptotic protein Bid
binds to RPA protein [36]. Bcl-2 has been shown to
impact DNA double strand break repair [37] by inhibition
of recruitment of Mre11 complex to the site of double
strand breaks in the DNA [38]. Collectively, these reports
establish mechanistic role of Bcl-2 family members in
DNA damage repair which is in addition to the pro and
anti-survival manifestations of these proteins.
Both MCL1 transcript and Mcl-1 protein are shortlived due to the presence of ARE-rich regions and PEST
domains in transcript and proteins, respectively. Hence,
even a short-term block or inhibition in transcription or
protein translation results in a decline in MCL1 transcript
and Mcl-1 protein levels. Furthermore, the stability of this
protein is impacted by several pathways. Erk, a kinase
involved in cancer cell survival, phosphorylates Mcl-1
which prevents proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 [39,
40]. Proteasomal degradation of Mcl-1 is dependent on
phosphorylation of this protein by GSK3β [41]. However,
phosphorylation of GSK3β by Akt mitigates activity of
GSK3β resulting in prolonged presence of Mcl-1 [42].
Both Akt and Erk are induced through BCR pathway [43,

44]. Corollary to this phenomenon, inhibition of BCR axis
by PI3K/Akt inhibitors modulates Akt and Erk activities
[2, 45] which may impact Mcl-1 protein stability and may
induce degradation of this protein.
Down regulation of MCL1 transcript and protein
levels was observed after treatment of CLL cells
during in vitro incubations (Figures 3 and 4) of CLL
cells with idelalisib. In concert to this observation,
clinically, treatment of patients with idelalisib showed
lowered expression of Mcl-1 protein in circulating CLL
lymphocytes after 2, 4, and 12 weeks of idelalisib intake
(Yang, Modi unpublished). Other small molecule targeted
inhibitors of PI3K [45], BCR pathway [46], and BTK [47]
also result in depletion or decrease in intracellular levels
of Mcl-1 protein in CLL lymphocytes. Overall, decrease
in Mcl-1 protein expression is a pharmacodynamic
phenomenon in CLL cells after treatment with BCR
pathway inhibitors.
The phase II clinical trial of bendamustine
and rituximab in relapsed/refractory CLL disease,
demonstrated 60% overall response-rate [48]. Although
the overall response rate and CR rate are lower than the
FCR therapy, this regimen is preferred for low untoward
toxicity profile. To increase response rates, fludarabine

harvested, stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), and the amount of apoptotic cells in each treated sample was detected using
flow cytometry. Experiments were done in triplicate, and the results show the averages ± SEM.

[49], ibrutinib (HELIOS trial; [50]), and idelalisib [51]
have been added to the bendamustine and rituximab
couplet regimen. The HELIOS trial was a randomized
study where bendamustine and rituximab combination was
compared with the triplet of bendamustine and rituximab
with ibrutinib. Addition of ibrutinib led to significant
benefit for overall response rate and progression-free
survival. Importantly, the triple combination did not add
any cumulative toxicities [50]. Similar to this combination,
preliminary and interim report also suggested that
idelalisib improves progression-free survival when added
to the bendamustine and rituximab couplet [51, 52]. These
trial results clearly suggest clinical benefit of adding
BCR pathway inhibitor to bendamustine plus rituximab
chemoimmunotherapy.
In conclusion, we demonstrate that the addition
of idelalisib synergistically benefits bendamustineinduced cytotoxicity in CLL lymphocytes. Furthermore,
idelalisib-mediated DNA damage response and decline
in MCL1 mRNA and Mcl-1 protein levels may in-part be
mechanisms of this synergistic cooperation.

Idelalisib (GS-1101 or CAL-101) was provided by
Gilead Sciences, Inc., (Foster City, CA). Bendamustine
hydrochloride was originally obtained from Cephalon
(Frazer, PA; now Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries,
Ltd., Petah Tikva, Israel) and was later purchased from
Selleckchem (Houston, TX). Both drugs were used in
micromolar concentrations that were chosen on the basis
of reported plasma concentrations of the free drug in
patients. [1, 2, 5, 12, 14, 20] For bendamustine we used
generally 20 µM exogenous drug. Bendamustine peak
levels are 28 µM [53] or 20 - 24 µM at 90 and 120 mg/m2
[54, 55]. For idelalisib, we generally used 20 µM. Because
more than 84% of idelalisib binds to human plasma
proteins [1], only 16% of the free drug is available to the
cells during in vitro culture conditions. Hence, exogenous
addition of 5 µM idelalisib to in vitro culture may result in
0.8 µM free idelalisib available for activity. Such free-drug
levels in plasma are achieved during idelalisib therapy.

MATERIAL, PATIENTS, AND METHODS
Patient sample collection
Peripheral blood was obtained from CLL patients
(Supplemental Table 1) who had given written informed
consent in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.
The study protocol was approved by the Institutional
Review Board of The UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated by
Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient centrifugation (Atlanta
Biologicals, Norcross, GA). Cells (1×107/mL) were
cultured in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% autologous
patient serum and were freshly used. For in vitro BCR
activation, CLL cells were stimulated with polyclonal goat
F(ab’)2 fragments of human IgM (MP Biomedicals, Santa
Ana, CA).

Cytotoxicity assays
For apoptotic assay, primary CLL cells were
untreated or treated with idelalisib, bendamustine, or
combination and stained with Annexin V and propidium
iodide and counted using flow cytometry, as described
previously. [56] Cells in all three quadrants (early
apoptosis, late apoptosis, and necrosis) were included to
obtain percent total cell death.

γH2AX staining

Mouse embryo fibroblast cell line

The cells obtained before and after incubation with
drugs were washed with PBS and fixed in 6 mL ice-cold
70% ethanol and analyzed for H2AX phosphorylation on
the flow cytometry. The cells were then fixed with 4%
fresh paraformaldehyde/PBS (pH 7.4) at room temperature
for 10 min. After couple of washes with BSA/PBS, the
cells were blocked with 5% goat serum for an hr. This was
followed by incubation with anti-phospho-Histone H2AX
(Ser139) mouse monoclonal antibody, clone JBW301,
FITC conjugate (16-202A; Upstate, Billerica, MA) for 2
hr. The labeled cells were washed and resuspended in PBS
containing the counterstain propidium iodide (15 μg/mL)
and RNAase (Roche, South San Francisco, CA) (2.5 μg/

Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), wild-type
and MCL1 deficient were generously provided by Dr.
Joseph T. Opferman at St. Jude Children’s Research
Hospital (Memphis, TN) [25] Both cell lines are Simian
virus (SV40)-transformed and the cells were maintained
in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium with L-glutamine
(DMEM; Invitrogen) media supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), Pen/Strep, L-Glut, and
non-essential amino acids (NEAA; GIBCO). Presence or
absence of Mcl-1 protein in these cells were confirmed
by Dr. Opferman’s group as well as by our group using
immunoblots. Cell lines were periodically tested for

mL) and incubated in dark for 5 min before analysis using
FACScalibur (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Data were
expressed as fold increase of H2AX phosphorylation. In
addition to flow cytometry assay, immunoblot assays were
also performed to test for H2AX phosphorylation.

editing the manuscript.

CONFLICTS OF INTEREST

Immunoblot analyses

V.G. received research funding from Gilead. Other
authors do not have a conflict of interest.

Extracts from cell lysates were quantitated for
protein concentration using a DC protein assay kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA), loaded and
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (GE Osmonics
Labstore, Minnetonka, MN, USA). Membranes were
blocked for 1 h in licor blocking buffer, incubated with
primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C against the following:
After washing with PBS-Tween-20, membranes were
incubated with infrared-labeled secondary antibodies (LICOR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) for an hour, scanned and
visualized using LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager. [14]
Antibodies for specific proteins and their catalog numbers
were used and are listed in the table (Supplemental Table
2).

RNA synthesis assay
Primary CLL cells were either untreated or treated
with idelalisib for the indicated time. For the last 30 min,
the cells were incubated with [5,6-3H]-uridine (1.0 mCi/
mL stock; Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA), and the
radioactive counts were measured by scintillation counter.
[14] Each treatment was done in triplicate and data were
presented as percent of control where control is timematched untreated CLL cells.

Editorial note

Transcript level measurements

This paper has been accepted based in part on peerreview conducted by another journal and the authors’
response and revisions as well as expedited peer-review
in Oncotarget.

CLL lymphocytes were treated with DMSO or with
idelalisib alone, bendamustine alone, or two drugs together
for 24 hours. TaqMan real-time reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction assay was used to measure
BCL2 and MCL1 transcript levels, which were normalized
to 18S ribosomal RNA as an endogenous control. [56]
