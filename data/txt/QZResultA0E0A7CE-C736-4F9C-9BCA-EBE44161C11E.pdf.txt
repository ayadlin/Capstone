BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy of mifepristone (RU-486) in
women with advanced or recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma or low-grade endometrial stromal sarcoma (LGESS). METHODS: Mifepristone (RU-486; 200 mg orally) was given daily to patients with progesterone receptor-positive advanced or recurrent endometrioid adenocarcinoma or LGESS. Patients were
evaluated every 4 weeks for toxicity and response. Quality-of-life data were obtained using the Memorial
Symptom Assessment Scale and Functional Assessment for Cancer Therapy. RESULTS: Twelve of 13 enrolled patients were evaluable in the first phase of accrual. Stable disease was noted in 3 of 12 patients (at
8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 77 weeks, respectively), and the median time to disease progression was 48 days.
Among the patients who had stable disease, 2 women had endometrioid endometrial cancer, and 1 woman
had LGESS. No partial or complete responses were observed. The most frequent grade 1 and 2 toxicities
were anorexia, fatigue, and mood alterations observed in 50%, 50%, and 58% of patients, respectively. The
most common grade 3 toxicities were fatigue and dyspnea observed in 25% and 17% of patients, respectively. One patient experienced grade 4 dyspnea. Thirty-three percent of patients had asymptomatic elevations of corticotropin. No serious treatment-related adverse events occurred. There were no significant
changes in quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent mifepristone used in the treatment of recurrent
endometrioid adenocarcinoma or LGESS resulted in a stable disease rate of 25%. One patient who had a biopsy-positive disease recurrence remained stable at 77 weeks. Although mifepristone was tolerated well,
as a single agent, it provided limited response as a single agent in women with progesterone receptor-positive uterine tumors. Recently, was been recognized that biologic agents used as single agents may result
only in stable disease unless they are combined with cytotoxic agents. The authors concluded that further

KEY WORDS: endometrial cancer, endometrial stromal sarcoma, mifepristone, RU-486, hormone therapy.

Endometrial cancer is the most common cancer of
the female genital tract in the US. It was expected to affect
40,100 women in the year 2008 and to cause 7470
deaths.1 Endometrioid histologies predominate and, of
these, 50% to 60% are estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) positive.2,3 Endometrial stromal sarcoma (ESS) is a rare tumor that comprises only 0.2% of
all malignant uterine tumors. Low-grade ESS (LGESS)
generally displays a slow growth pattern, and 37% to 60%
of these tumors recur many years after resection of the
primary tumor.4 The majority of LGESS are positive for
ER, and many are positive for PR.3,5-7
Therapy options for patients with recurrent/
advanced endometrial cancer are limited. Treatment with
radiation and chemotherapy has produced only limited
success.8 However, the presence of ER and PR has been
correlated directly with survival and response to hormone
therapy and has been correlated inversely with tumor
grade.9 Progesterones used for the primary treatment of
well differentiated and recurrent endometrioid endometrial cancer have been associated with a response rates
from 18% to 25% and stable disease rates from 20% to
50%.3,10,11 Used in the treatment of LGESS, progesterone-associated responses range from 33% to 45%, once
again justifying the use of hormone-targeting agents in
these tumors.12,13 To our knowledge to date, the role of
mifepristone (RU-486), a selective PR modulator (SPRM),
in the clinical treatment of endometrial cancer has
remained unexplored. It has been demonstrated that mifepristone has a dose-dependent in vitro inhibitory effect on
endometrial cancer cell lines and can reduce the myometrial volume in benign leiomyoma.14-17 Although, the
mechanism of inhibition is unknown, the regulation of
PR concentration through vascular alterations of the
endometrium and manipulation of p53 have been
reported.15,18,19 This, this information served as a basis
for the design of the current trial.
Mifepristone is a substituted 19-nortestosterone
derivative that requires 2-step demethylation and hydroxylation to obtain its active form. It has a long half-life
1868

(18 hours), and there is no evidence of accumulation with
chronic dosing.20 Mifepristone also exhibits antiglucocorticoid and weak antiandrogenic activity.20,21 The antiprogestational activity of mifepristone results from
competitive interaction with progesterone at PR sites. On
the basis of studies in several animal species (mouse, rabbit, and monkey), the compound inhibits the activity of
either endogenous or exogenous progesterone.22,23 Mifepristone, as an antiprogestin, acts on the endometrium
and blocks the action of progesterone at the cellular level
by binding to the PR. The affinity of mifepristone for the
PR is 5-fold greater than the endogenous progesterone.
Consequently, it can produce a progesterone-like effect in
the absence of progesterone.21,24 Some have referred to
mifepristone as a selective progesteron receptor modulator
(SPRM), and this complex mode of action may be related
to the interaction of mifepristone with the 2 isoforms of
the PR (alpha and beta).25,26
This SPRM action partially explains the growth-inhibitory effect of mifepristone on endometrial cancer cell
lines.15,16 Its primary abortifacient effect, however, is
caused by the antiprogesterone and associated prostaglandin (PG)-inducing effects. It is believed that mifepristone
sensitizes the uterus to PGs and, when administered in the
first trimester of pregnancy at a single dose of 600 mg,
causes pregnancy termination.22,27,28 It has been established that the effect of RU-486 on the endometrium is
dependent on the timing of administration during the
menstrual cycle.29 Since the design of this study, we have
completed an in vitro investigation, and the results suggest
that mifepristone also may work through an apoptotic
effect to alter p53 and bcl-2.15 Others also have suggested
that the combination of mifepristone with a PG synthesis
inhibitor further increases the number of apoptotic,
degenerative, and vascular changes induced by the drug in
addition to the hormone mode of action noted in benign
endometrium.27
Patients with recurrent uterine cancer, especially
those burdened with high tumor volume and chemotherapy-resistant disease, often prefer less toxic regiments to

aggressive chemotherapy, which has a minimal chance of
producing long-term response rates. Patients prefer oral
chemotherapy regimens to other forms of administration
as long as efficacy is not sacrificed.30 The objective of this
study was to evaluate the efficacy of mifepristone in
patients with PR-positive, advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer or LGESS.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Women with histologically confirmed, inoperable, recurrent or metastatic endometrioid carcinoma of the endometrium or LGESS were eligible for enrollment. This
study was conducted at The University of Texas M. D.
Anderson Cancer Center after receiving approval from
the Institutional Review Board for the protocol. Patients
must have undergone previous radical surgery (minimum,
total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy) and definitive radiotherapy or were not
candidates for such procedures. Mifepristone was given
orally at 200 mg once daily continuously (for a 4-week
cycle). Mifepristone was obtained from Danco Laboratories, LLC (New York, NY). The decision to select this
dose of mifepristone for this trial was based on safety data
generated from the European clinical trials using mifepristone (200-400 mg daily) in women with recurrent or
metastatic breast cancer and ovarian cancer.31-33
The trial required primary or recurrent tumors that
were >10% PR positive. Positive hormone receptor status
was defined as 10% PR-positive cells as determined by
immunohistochemistry. Previous radiotherapy had to be
completed at least 2 weeks before the initiation of mifepristone, and patients must have recovered from the acute side
effects of such treatment. Women were required to have a
Zubrod performance status 2 with an estimated life
expectancy of at least 21 weeks. Hepatic, renal, or hematologic laboratory toxicities could be no greater than grade 1.
Previous chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer was permitted. The patients must have had
measurable disease as defined by the presence of bidimensionally measurable lesions with clearly defined margins on
x-ray, scan (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]), or physical examination.
Patients with a history of other malignancies were
excluded. Patients also were excluded if they had uncontrolled hypercalcemia or if they were taking phenytoin,
phenobarbital, or carbamazepine. Patients were excluded
Cancer

if they had a known predisposition to thromboembolic
disorder or known unstable or untreated brain metastases.
Women who were taking estrogen, progestin, antiestrogens, or other chemotherapy agents had to discontinue
their use at least 3 weeks before beginning treatment with
mifepristone.
Before starting mifepristone, patients were evaluated
using CT or MRI scans, chest x-ray, and basic metabolic
panel. Cortisol and corticotropin (ACTH) levels also
were assessed at baseline and after the first 3 courses of
treatment. If cortisol and ACTH results were normal,
then no further testing was obtained unless the patient
was symptomatic.
Quality-of-life and symptom data were obtained
using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and the Memorial Symptom Assessment
Scale (MSAS).34,35 Patients were asked to complete these
surveys before they started treatment, after Cycles 1 and 2,
and every third cycle thereafter until the end of the study.
Response to treatment was evaluated at the end of Course
2 and every third course thereafter until discontinuation
from the study.

Dose Modifications
Mifepristone was prescribed at 200 mg once daily. If
patients developed grade 1 or 2 dermatologic side effects,
then they stopped therapy until resolution of the rash. If
the rash resolved within 14 days, then mifepristone was
restarted at 100 mg once daily with the addition of oral
diphenhydramine 25 mg once daily and oral cimetidine
300 mg 3 times daily. If the rash did not resolve to grade 0
or 1 or if the rash reappeared once it was treated, then the
patient was removed from the study at the investigator’s
discretion. Patients with grade 3 dermatologic side effects
were removed from the study.

Duration of Therapy
Mifepristone was given for at least 2 cycles (8 weeks)
unless there was rapidly progressive disease. If the study
had been continued, then patients who achieved a complete remission would have been continued on therapy for
an additional 2 years after that remission, and patients
who achieved either a partial remission or stable disease
according to version 2.0 of the National Cancer Institute
1869

(CTCAE) would have been continued on therapy until
they developed disease progression.
Patients who experienced significant toxicities
according to the CTCAE either had treatment interrupted
until the toxicities resolved or were removed from the
study at the discretion of the investigator. Patients who
did not recover from treatment toxicities at least to grade
1 within 2 weeks of stopping the drug were taken off the
study. Because of reports of Addisonian symptoms with
the use of mifepristone, we tested for the development of
Addisonian changes.20

Statistical Analysis
This was a single-arm, nonrandomized phase 2 trial of
mifepristone for patients with PR-positive, advanced/
recurrent endometrial endometrioid adenocarcinoma and
LGESS. The study planned to enroll up to 37 patients
using Simon’s optimal 2-stage design to evaluate the first
12 patients in the first phase.36 The primary endpoint was
overall response rate, including complete and partial
responses. Stable disease was not considered a response.
Activity was calculated as the proportion of patients with
responsive disease (95% confidence interval [95% CI]).
Treatment toxicity was evaluated. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to estimate time to progression and
overall survival.

Sample Size and Stopping Rule
Simon’s optimal 2-stage design was used.36 The null
hypothesis was that the overall response rate would be
<5% versus the alternative hypothesis that the overall
response rate would be >20%. At the first stage, 12 evaluable patients were enrolled. Because no responses were
observed, the trial was terminated.
This design yielded >.90 probability of a positive
result if the true response rate was >20%. It yielded a
>.90 probability of a negative result if the true response
rate was <5% with >.54 probability of early negative
stopping. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the
quality-of-life data collected at specified time points. All
P values <.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
Between November 2001 and February 2006, 13 patients
were enrolled in the study. Patient and disease characteristics are outlined in Table 1. Two patients had LGESS,
and 11 patients had endometrioid adenocarcinoma.
Twelve patients were evaluable for response. One patient
with endometrioid histology was not evaluable, because
she had brain metastases identified immediately after
enrollment. The mean patient age was 59 years (range,
29-77 years). Eight patients had received previous chemotherapy. The primary agents used were taxol and carboplatin; however, 1 participant each received either
doxorubicin, etoposide, or gemcitabine in combination
with platinum.
All patients had developed recurrent disease. Seven
patients (58%) developed recurrences strictly outside of a
previous radiation field. Of these, 3 patients had received
previous external pelvic radiation and brachytherapy. The

sites of recurrence included the vaginal apex, liver, lung,
periurethra, and sigmoid mesocolon and the aortocaval,
para-aortic, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Three patients (25%) developed disease recurrences
strictly within a previous radiation field. Of these, all 3
had received previous external pelvic radiation, and 1 also
had received radiation to the para-aortic lymph nodes.
Two of patients had received previous brachytherapy.
Recurrence sites in these patients included the iliac crest
and sacrum, the common iliac lymph nodes, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
Two patients (17%) developed recurrences both
within and outside of a previous radiation field. Both of
these patients had received previous external pelvic radiation, and 1 patient had received previous brachytherapy.
Sites of disease recurrence in these patients included the
groin, vaginal cuff, pelvic and periaortic lymph nodes,
liver, and lung.
Of the patients who had stable disease on mifepristone, 2 of 3 patients had received previous radiotherapy,
and both developed recurrences within the radiated field.
Furthermore, both of these women also had been exposed
previously to taxol and carboplatin. Because of the small
number of women with stable disease, it was difficult to
determine whether the response was related to the biology
of recurrences within a radiated field or chemoresistance.
All patients had confirmed PR-positive disease, and
8 patients (66%) had ER-positive disease. Three patients
not evaluated for ER status. No patients died during the
study. No patients had a clinical partial or complete
response. Three patients had evidence of stable disease for
8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 77 weeks, respecitively. Nine
patients had disease progression at the first evaluation
time point (8 weeks). The median overall survival
from the time of enrollment was 308 days (approximately
10 months), and the median progression-free survival was
48 days (Fig. 1).
Mifepristone was tolerated well: There were no dose
reductions, and there were no delays because of drug toxicity. Greater than 30 cycles of treatment were completed.
No serious treatment-related adverse events occurred. The
most frequently reported grade 1/2 toxicities were anorexia, fatigue, and mood alterations (50%, 50%, and
58%, respectively). Ten patients had asymptomatic grade
1 increases in ACTH (83%), and 10 patients had asymptomatic grade 1 increases in serum cortisol (83%). The

most common grade 3 toxicities were fatigue and dyspnea
(25% and 17%, respectively). Only 1 patient experienced
grade 4 dyspnea. A summary of adverse events is presented
in Table 2.
Eight serious adverse events were reported. All
required hospitalizations. None were definitely drug
related and, instead, appeared to be tumor related. One
patient developed a superficial thrombosis that improved
with ibuprofen and leg elevation. There was no evidence
of deep vein thrombosis.
Twelve of 13 enrolled patients completed the baseline quality-of-life and symptom surveys, 7 patients completed surveys after Cycle 1, and 5 patients completed
surveys after Cycle 2. There was an overall improvement
in general quality-of-life scores from baseline until after
Cycles 1 and 2, but these changes were not statistically significant. This pattern also was observed for the physical
and functional subscales of the FACT-G. Similarly, there
was an overall improvement in symptom assessment
scores over time; however, again, these changes were not
statistically significant. Specific subscale scores suggested
that physical and psychological symptoms improved over
time. Improvements also were noted for the Global Distress Index and for total MSAS scores.

DISCUSSION
In this population, treatment with mifepristone overall
resulted in a 25% stable disease rate that lasted from
8 weeks up to 77 weeks at the time of last follow-up.
Seventy-five percent of patients experienced disease

progression. These are disappointing results compared
with the historic response rates reported with progesterone and megestrol acetate.9 This may be related to the
lack of grade 1 tumors in the patients who enrolled in this
trial. This also is unexpected given in vitro observations
that mifepristone has a direct inhibitory effect on endometrial cell growth, specifically in the EM42, KLE,
RL95-2, HEC-1-A, and Ishikawa cell lines, as well as apoptosis-inducing activity.15,16,37
Unfortunately, to our knowledge, no treatment for
recurrent uterine cancer has been reported to prolong success rates significantly. A recent meta-analysis of 2471
patients who received various treatments, including progestogens, tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors, gonadotropin
releasing hormone analogs, and progestogen or progetogen/tamoxifen combination regimens for grade 1 through
3 endometrioid endometrial cancer, had the following
response rates. Patients with grade 1 and 2 tumors had
response rates that ranged from 14% to 100% with higher
response rates in women who had PR-positive tumors9;
and the Gynecologic Oncology Group studied alternating
megestrol acetate/tamoxifen and reported a response rate
of 38% in women with grade 1 tumors, 24% in women
with grade 2 tumors, and 22% in women with grade 3
tumors.39
A growth-suppressive effect of mifepristone has
been demonstrated in breast cancer cell lines in which
both progesterones and antiprogesterones inhibited the
growth of PR-positive carcinoma cell lines. It was determined that the mechanism of inhibition was apoptosis
and the prevention of cell entry into the mitotic phase of
1872

the cell cycle.16,40 Other reports have indicated that, in
breast and prostate cancer cell lines, the degree of apoptotic cell death may be increased with the combination of
mifepristone and tamoxifen.27,38 It also is worth noting
that progesterone therapy for endometrial cancer reportedly acts through the suppression of cell proliferation but
not through apoptosis.28 Another aspect of growth inhibition induced by mifepristone may be related to vascular
changes in the endometrium. It has been demonstrated in
some cell types that progestins stimulate the expression of
vascular endothelial growth factor and, thus, theoretically
partially control cell growth or metastasis.41 The administration of mifepristone in vivo produced endometrial
changes consistent with vascular stasis, vasoconstriction,
vasoregession, and enhanced leukocytic infiltration.38
Two European clinical trials that used mifepristone
(200 to 400 mg daily) in women with recurrent or progressive metastatic breast cancer resulted in a partial
response or stable disease in 53% to 63% of women; unfortunately, however, the response duration was brief.31,33
Romieu et al studied 22 patients with advanced breast
cancer who failed tamoxifen and reported 12 partial
responses or stabilization for 6 to 40 weeks; however, 82%
of their patients progressed by 3 months.33 Response was
correlated with positive PR status, as anticipated. Recently,
a phase 2 trial using mifepristone 200 mg daily was completed in 44 patients with ovarian cancer. Thirty-four of
those patients were evaluable, and there was a 26.5%
objective response rate. Testing for positive ER/PR status
was not performed in that trial. Again, the duration of
response was short (range,1-4 months).32

Reasons for low response rates in this study may be
related to the finding that the mechanism of action of
mifepristone remains unclear. New studies have demonstrated that this SPRM may not work simply by modulating hormone receptors as reported previously. Several
hypotheses now propose additional mifepristone activity
on the expression of several proteins, including BAX,
bcl-2, p53, and cyclooxygenase-2.15,16 Supporting this,
Kamradt et al demonstrated the restoration of p53 expression by mifepristone in dexamethasone-induced, radioresistant cervical carcinoma cells.42
In our population, mifepristone was well tolerated.
The most frequently reported grade 1 and 2 tumor-related
toxicities were anorexia, fatigue, and mood alterations
(50%, 50%, and 58%, respectively). Eighty-three percent
of patients had asymptomatic elevations of ACTH and
cortisol. Mood alterations may have been related to
changes in cortisol levels. No serious treatment-related
adverse events occurred. Although the data suggest that
patients’ quality of life and symptoms improved over
time, particularly those related to physical and functional
well being and physical and psychologic symptoms, these
observations were not statistically significant because of
the small sample size.
Single-agent mifepristone was tolerated well and did
not have a negative impact on quality of life. However,
only a 25% stable disease response rate was recorded. Our
findings suggest that single-agent mifepristone should not
be used in this disease setting, because medroxyprogesterone acetate, megestrol acetate, leuprorelin, and combined
megestrol acetate plus tamoxifen all would be expected to
exhibit higher response rates (range, 9%-100%) in patients
with grade 1, 2, and 3 tumors.9 However, a possible synergistic effect between mifepristone and chemotherapeutic
agents was not addressed by this study. The results of this
study underscore the need to continue developing novel
treatments for patients with recurrent endometrial cancer.
Further research into the exact mechanism of the cytotoxic
effect of mifepristone on endometrial cancer lines is
needed to explore further the benefit of mifepristone therapy in the treatment of endometrial cancer.
