have required attenuated dosages of interleukin 2 (IL-2) that may have compromised efficacy.

METHODS. In a phase 2 study, the authors tested sequential temozolomide (75
mg/m2 per day orally for 3 weeks) followed by high-dose, IL-2 (600,000 U/kg per
dose intravenously; maximum, 14 doses over 5 days).

RESULTS. Thirty-eight patients with treatment-naive American Joint Committee

disease, and 24 patients with M1c disease) were enrolled. Ten patients had a history of treated brain metastases. Thirty-one patients who received at least 2
ubinemia (9 patients), hematologic toxicities (leukopenia in 5 patients, thrombocytopenia in 3 patients), diarrhea (2 patients), and oliguria (1 patient). One
patient had grade 4 nausea. The overall response rate (ORR) was 16% and
included 3 complete responses that lasted 10.8 months, 32 months, and 36
months and 2 partial responses that lasted 13 months and 14 months. Responses
were observed in patients with M1a disease and in patients with M1c disease.
Sixteen patients had stable disease (15 patients progressed). The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.7-7.5
months). The probability of PFS at 6 months was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.33-0.67). Among
38 enrolled patients, 16 patients remained alive at a median follow-up of 6.7
months (range, 1.9-36.1 months). The median overall survival (OS) was 12.1
months (95% CI, 9.1-16.4 months), and the probability of 12-month OS was 0.54
(95% CI, 0.34-0.70 months).

CONCLUSIONS. The current results indicated that it is safe to administer HD IL-2
sequentially with temozolomide and that this combination has lower toxicity
than previously used concurrent biochemotherapy regimens. However, The ORR
and the durability of responses with this combination did not exceed those of
single-agent HD IL-2. Cancer 2008;113:1632-40.  2008 American Cancer Society.

etastatic melanoma remains a disease with a poor prognosis
and a median survival duration <1 year. Single-agent dacarbazine or temozolomide is capable of producing responses in the
range from 6.7% to 20% of patients, but long-term remissions are
rare, and no impact on survival is evident.1,2 It has not been demonstrated that combination chemotherapy is superior to single-agent
chemotherapy.3-6 High-dose (HD) interleukin 2 (IL-2) produces a

response rate of 16% in patients with stage IV melanoma, some of which are durable.7
Temozolomide is a cytotoxic alkylating agent
that is metabolized to the same active metabolite, monomethyl triazenoimidazole carboxamide
(MTIC),8,9 as dacarbazine. A randomized phase 3 trial
of oral temozolomide administered at a dose of 200
mg/m2 per day for 5 of every 28 days, compared
with intravenous dacarbazine in patients with metastatic melanoma, demonstrated that temozolomide
was at least equivalent to dacarbazine in terms of
response rate and survival.2 However, temozolomide
possesses the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier10 and has ease of oral administration with 100%
bioavailability.9,11-13
In addition, there is a potential for schedule variation with temozolomide to reduce toxicity and
improve efficacy by reversing drug resistance. It is
believed that the cytotoxicity of MTIC is caused primarily by alkylation at the O6 position of guanine,11
with additional alkylation at the N7 and N3 positions
of lesser importance.12 O6-alkyl-guanine-DNA-alkyltransferase (AGAT) is a DNA repair protein that
removes methyl adducts from DNA, thereby reversing the cytotoxicity of temozolomide by restoring
DNA to its native state. Administration of temozolomide results in decreased AGAT activity, as measured
in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)14;
and it was demonstrated that continuous, prolonged,
daily administration of temozolomide more effectively depleted the activity of AGAT (73% after 21
days, with the low levels persisting up to Day 28).15
In the phase 1 studies of continuous daily temozolomide, including a trial of 21 days of temozolomide of
a 28-day dosing schedule, dose-limiting toxicities
were hematologic, and the maximum tolerated dose
was 100 mg/m2.16,17 The dose of 75 mg/m2 per day
allowed for a 2.1-fold greater exposure to drug per
28-day period compared with the 5-day schedule of
200 mg/m2 per day repeated every 28 days.
Two approaches to biochemotherapy (BCT) have
involved sequential chemotherapy followed by
immunotherapy in 1 approach and concurrent chemoimmunotherapy in the other. The sequential
approach, testing chemotherapy with cisplatin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine (CVD) followed by IL-2
and interferon a2b (IFN), was compared with chemotherapy (CVD) alone in a randomized trial conducted at the M. D. Andersen Cancer Center.
Although response rates and time-to-progression
were improved for the sequential BCT group, the survival difference was only of borderline significance,
and toxicity was formidable.18 A concurrent BCT regimen of CVD coupled with IL-2 and IFN was tested in

1633

a phase 2 study, and the results from that combination appeared to be equivalent to those from the sequential BCT regimen with more practicality and
lower toxicity. The concurrent CVD/IL-2/IFN regimen
subsequently was adopted by the US Intergroup and
compared with CVD in an important randomized
phase 3 trial (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
[ECOG] trial 3695), but it failed to produce significantly better response rates, progression-free survival
(PFS), or overall survival (OS) relative to chemotherapy alone.19 Two other phase 3 trials of slightly different BCT regimens conducted in Europe failed to
demonstrate an improvement in response or recurrence rates or in OS.20,21 A recent meta-analysis from
18 trials (11 trials of chemotherapy with or without
IFN and 7 of trials chemotherapy with or without
IFN plus IL-2) demonstrated no benefit for BCT on
OS.22 Therefore, we conducted a phase 2 study to
test a new approach of single-agent chemotherapy
with temozolomide administered in an extended
schedule followed by HD IL-2 to evaluate the safety
and efficacy of this sequential combination in
patients with advanced metastatic melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Patients ages 18 years to 70 years were eligible if
they had histologically confirmed metastatic melanoma (American Joint Committee on Cancer [AJCC]
stage IV) and measurable or evaluable disease
according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in
Solid Tumors (RECIST). Previous chemotherapy or
immunotherapy for stage IV melanoma was not
allowed, except for 1 prior therapy with vaccines or
granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor or
prior radiation therapy. Adjuvant therapy with immunologic agents, including IFN, IL-2, and vaccines,
was permitted. Eligible patients also were required to
have met the following criteria: a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status (PS) of 0 or 1,
and adequate hematologic values (an absolute neutrophil count [ANC] 1500 cells/lL, hemoglobin 10
g/dL, platelet count 100,000/lL), hepatic function
(serum bilirubin 2 times the upper limit of normal
[ULN] and serum alanine and aspartate transferase
levels 3 times the ULN), and renal function (serum
creatinine <2 mg/dL or a calculated clearance >60
mL/minute). Patients with brain metastases were eligible, but only after they received definitive treatment, including surgical resection, stereotactic
radiosurgery (SRS), whole-brain radiation therapy
(WBRT), or combinations.

All patients aged >45 years or as clinically indicated underwent a cardiac stress test and pulmonary
function tests within 8 weeks before registration.
They were eligible if they had no significant abnormality on cardiac stress testing and if they had a
forced expiratory volume in 1 second >2 L or >75%
of the predicted value.
All patients provided a written informed consent.
Men and women of childbearing potential were
instructed to use an approved method of birth control. Premenopausal women were required to have a
negative serum pregnancy test.

Study Design and Treatment
This was a phase 2, single-arm, safety and efficacy
study of sequential temozolomide and HD IL-2 that
was carried out at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Eligible patients received temozolomide
(75 mg/m2 per day orally) continuously for 3 weeks
in an outpatient setting. HD IL-2 was administered
after temozolomide during Week 4 at a dose of
600,000 U/kg per dose as a 15-minute intravenous
infusion every 8 hours for 5 days (maximum, 14
doses). IL-2 therapy was carried out in a specialized
inpatient oncology unit (not an intensive care unit).
Administration of HD IL-2 followed the guidelines
established by the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
Each cycle of therapy lasted 4 weeks. The cycle was
repeated, and disease assessment was carried out
first after 2 cycles of therapy (Table 1). A patient had
to complete at least 2 cycles of HD IL-2 to be considered evaluable for response assessment in this phase
2 study.
Patients without evidence of disease progression
at response assessment (partial response [PR], complete response [CR], minor response, or stable disease [SD]) were offered additional cycles of therapy 2
weeks after they completed an even-numbered cycle.
All toxicities were required to resolve to grade 2 or
less before reinitiation of therapy. A delay of an additional week (maximum, 3 weeks after each evennumbered cycle) was allowed for patient convenience or recovery from toxicity. Institutional Review
Board approval was obtained.
Toxicity and Response Assessments
The NCI’s Common Toxicity Criteria version 3.0
(available at: http://ctep.cancer.gov/forms/CTCAEv3.
pdf accessed on February 20, 2008) was used for
grading toxicities. Patients were monitored for toxicity every 1 to 2 weeks on temozolomide and on Days
1 through 5 of each HD IL-2 treatment cycle.

dies of the brain were obtained at baseline. Radiologic studies were repeated at the completion of every
even-numbered cycle to assess response. RECIST criteria were used to determine the levels of response.

Dose Modifications
Dose adjustments during temozolomide treatment
were required to be done according to hematologic
or nonhematologic toxicities assessed at least every 2
weeks. Stopping treatment was required if blood
counts tested at 3 weeks remained unsatisfactory.
The reduced dose, based on toxicity, was considered
the starting dose of temozolomide for subsequent
cycles.
For HD IL-2, established NCI guidelines for
administration were followed. Patients were assessed
continuously, and a decision whether or not to
administer a dose of IL-2 was made at each 8-hour
time point.
Statistical Methods
This was a single-arm, phase 2 clinical trial. A 2-stage
Simon-type phase 2 study design23 was used. The
primary data analysis was estimation with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the objective response rate.
The response rates were calculated for patients with
measurable disease. For the analysis of secondary
objectives, toxicities were summarized by grade, frequency, and duration. PFS and OS were estimated by
using the Kaplan-Meier method.24

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
In total, 38 patients with AJCC stage IV melanoma
were enrolled between March 2004 and April 2006.
There were 24 men and 14 women. The median age
was 50 years (age range, 27-74 years). Twentypatients (73.7%) had a WHO PS of 0 (normal), and
10 patients (26.3%) had a WHO PS of 1 (ambulatory).

Treatment Details
All 38 patients received temozolomide, and no
patient required a temozolomide dose reduction.
Four patients did not receive any IL-2 because of
rapid clinical disease progression (PD) and declining
PS. Three patients received only 1 cycle of IL-2
because of declining PS (1 patient), rapid PD after 1
cycle (1 patient), and patient decision (1 patient).
Thirty-one patients received at least 2 cycles (1
course) of IL-2. Table 3 summarizes the treatment
details by course, cycle, and dosage.
In total, 123 cycles were administered (median, 2
cycles per patient). No dose modifications were

Efficacy
Thirty-one patients received at least 2 cycles of therapy according to protocol and were evaluable for
response assessment. The overall response rate was
16.1% (95% CI, 3.2%-29.1%). In April 2007, 3 patients
(9.7%) had a CR that lasted 10.8 months (M1c disease), 32 months (M1c disease), and 36 months
(M1a disease) from the first tumor response assessment point after at least 2 cycles of therapy. Two
patients (6.5%) had PRs that lasted 13 months (M1a
disease) and 14 months (M1c disease), respectively,
from the first tumor response assessment. Sixteen
patients (51.6%) had SD that lasted from 2 months

patient with M1c disease who had SD that still was
ongoing at the last follow-up (11 months) (Table 4).
The 3 patients who did not have PD were
observed at 11 months, 32 months, and 36 months.
The median PFS was 5.3 months (95% CI, 3.7-7.5
months), and the probability of PFS at 6 months was
0.52 (95% CI, 0.33-0.67). Figure 1 shows the KaplanMeier plot of the probability of PFS.
Among 38 patients who were enrolled on the
study, 16 patients remained alive at a median followup of 6.7 months (range 1.9-36.1 months). The median OS was 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.1-16.4 months),
and the probability of 12-month OS was 0.54 (95%
CI, 0.34-0.70). Figure 2 shows the Kaplan-Meier plot
of the probability of OS.
Among 10 patients with treated brain metastases,
1 patient received 1 cycle of IL-2 and was not evaluable for response. Three patients had PD after 2
cycles. Six patients had SD that lasted from 2 months
to 7 months. Among 9 evaluable patients who had
treated brain metastases on enrollment, 5 patients
had recurrent brain metastases on progression.
Among the remaining response-evaluable patients, 3
patients had evidence of brain metastases on progression.

Safety
The most frequent nonhematologic grade 3 or 4
adverse events were high bilirubin in 9 patients
(24%), transient hypotension associated with IL-2
infusion in 3 patients (8%), diarrhea in 2 patients

(5%), and oliguria in 1 patient (3%). Hematologic
grade 3 or 4 adverse events included leukopenia (5
patients; 13.2%) and thrombocytopenia (3 patients;
7.9%). No patient had treatment terminated because
of adverse events. The most common reason for
treatment discontinuation was disease progression
(25 patients). Of the 22 deaths reported as of April
2007, no deaths were related to treatment toxicity.
Table 5 summarizes the most frequently reported
adverse events by severity.

DISCUSSION
This study explored the safety and efficacy of sequential BCT using the 2 best-known agents in
advanced metastatic melanoma. The objective was to
improve the efficacy and tolerability of this regimen
over previously tested BCT regimens. It is apparent
that temozolomide produces single-agent results that
are equivalent to those produced by dacarbazine2
but with certain advantages, including oral administration and the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier.10 In terms of immunotherapeutic approaches to
metastatic melanoma, to our knowledge, the only
agent that has demonstrated durable responses in at
least a small percentage of patients is HD IL-2.7
Therefore, in the current study, we combined singleagent chemotherapy with temozolomide and singleagent immunotherapy with HD IL-2, both administered without dose attenuation, and evaluated the efficacy of this sequential combination in patients with
AJCC stage IV melanoma. The phase 3 M. D. Anderson Cancer Center trial of sequential CVD chemotherapy followed by IL-2 and IFN produced a
doubling of the response rate and the time to

progression and a borderline survival advantage, albeit
at the expense of major grade 3 and 4 toxicity.18 Conversely, the concurrent approach using these same
drugs reportedly was ineffective.19 This may hint that
the myelotoxic effects of concurrent therapy compromise the ability of IL-2 to induce an effective immune
response. It is noteworthy that our sequential BCT regimen delivered IL-2 on Days 21 and 49, unlike standard
HD IL-2 monotherapy, as reported by Atkins et al.7
The overall response rate in the current study
was 16% (95% CI, (3.18%-29.08%). All 5 responders
had durable responses that lasted >10 months, and 2
of those responses were ongoing for 32 months
and 36 months at last follow-up. Responses were
observed in both M1a disease and M1c disease. One
patient with M1c disease had SD that was ongoing
for 11 months at last follow-up. Although the
response rate was comparable, the quality of the
responses was superior to the quality of responses
reported with BCT in ECOG 3695.19 The median PFS
was 5.3 months with 95% CI (3.7-7.5 months) in the
current study compared with ECOG 3695, in which

1637

the median PFS was 3.6 months for the chemotherapy-treated controls (CVD) and 5.3 months for the
BCT arm (CVD plus IL-2 and IFN). The median OS
was 12.1 months (95% CI, 9.1-16.4 months) in the
current study compared with 8.7 months for the
chemotherapy arm and 8.4 months for the BCT arm
in ECOG 3695. Conversely, the overall response rate
and the durability of responses do not exceed those
reported with single-agent HD IL-2.7 Our own data
from a clinical trial at the University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute with HD IL-2 after failure on BCT
produced an overall response rate of 19.2% in a
heavily pretreated population with advanced disease.26 Responses included 4 patients with CR,
including 2 CRs that were ongoing at 26 months
and at 41 months, suggesting that HD IL-2 is active
in patients who have either failed treatment or progressed after treatment with lower dose IL-2-based
BCT. Although no randomized clinical trials were
conducted in patients with melanoma, a randomized
phase 3 trial in patients with metastatic renal cell
carcinoma demonstrated that HD IL-2 was superior
to low-dose IL-2 and IFN.27 These data may support
the hypothesis that HD IL-2 is superior to continuous-infusion IL-2 at the intermediate dose used in
the BCT regimen that was tested in the ECOG 3695
intergroup trial and may suggest that future IL-2based regimens in melanoma must consider the
importance of dose intensity with IL-2 therapy.
Researchers recently have started to explore the
utility of OS or PFS as benchmarks for efficacy in
phase 2 studies instead of the traditional objective
tumor response rate.28 On the basis of a recent
meta-analysis of previously collected data from 42
melanoma phase 2 trials conducted by the Southwest
Oncology Group, ECOG, Cancer and Leukemia Group
B, the North Central Cancer Treatment Group, and
the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical
Trials Group in the years 1975 through 2005, Korn
et al have suggested the use of 1-year OS or 6-month
PFS as benchmarks for future phase 2 studies.
That meta-analysis, which was based on 1278
patients, provided an estimate of the 1-year OS rate
(25.5%) and 1-year OS rates for 24 prognostic classes
(ranging from 5.5% to 63.8%) defined by 4 statistically significant, independent prognostic factors that
included PS, the presence of visceral metastasis, sex,
and the exclusion of patients with brain metastasis.
The authors of the meta-analysis acknowledged that
future trials may have different survival rates than in
the past because of patient mixes that differ in terms
of prognostic variables. To address this, they considered defining the null hypothesis target for a phase 2
trial based on the prognostic variables recorded in

the trial. They provided a table that contained the
relevant information for a trial using a 1-year OS rate
as the endpoint. These predicted values were based
on a logistic regression analysis with effects included
for PS, sex, the presence of visceral metastasis, and
whether a trial allowed patients with brain metastasis. We used this model for our study because our
mix of patients with the same PS, incidence of visceral disease, and sex distribution and because we
included patients with brain metastasis. To account
for the immaturity of follow-up for some patients,
we eliminated 10 of the total 38 patients who were
alive with <1 year of follow-up. By including only the
remaining 28 patients, we observed that 6 patients
were alive at 1 year for a 1-year survival rate of 21.4%
(90% CI, 9.8%-38%), whereas the expected 1-year survival rate was 26.9%. By excluding patients who were
not evaluable for response (those who did not complete 2 cycles of HD IL-2), the expected 1-year survival rate became 27.6%, essentially identical to the
original estimate of 26.9%. According to this reasoning, we conclude that there is no evidence that our
regimen is promising or worthy of phase 3 testing.
Brain metastases in patients with stage IV melanoma have been reported in at least 18% to 46% of
patients,29,30 with roughly twice this prevalence
reported in autopsy series.30-33 Brain metastases are a
major cause of morbidity and mortality, leading
directly to death in as many as 95% of patients with
melanoma who have central nervous system spread of
the disease.30,33,34 Definitive local treatment can be
achieved with surgery or SRS with or without WBRT in
carefully selected patients who have limited disease
and may prolong survival.35-40 Among 9 patients with
treated brain metastases on enrollment who completed at least 2 cycles of therapy, 6 patients had SD
that lasted from 2 months to 7 months. Five patients
had recurrent brain metastases on progression. Among
the 22 remaining response-evaluable patients, 3
patients had evidence of brain metastases on progression. According to a before-and-after paired analysis
(Table 6), only 7 patients changed with therapy. Four
patients with brain metastasis before therapy pro-

gressed, but not to the brain, and 3 patients without
brain metastasis before therapy had brain metastasis
at progression after therapy. The other 24 patients did
not change their before-after brain metastasis state
and did not contribute to that paired analysis. Therefore, there was no significant change in the incidence
of brain metastasis because of the therapy or among
the cohort of patients who were treated.
A recent retrospective analysis has suggested that
the outcome of BCT is comparable in patients with
and without brain metastases if brain metastases are
controlled with multidisciplinary treatment. Among
70 patients who received BCT (consisting of either
dacarbazine or temozolomide in combination with a
96-hour continuous intravenous infusion of IL-2 and
subcutaneous IFN) for metastatic melanoma, 20
patients had recently diagnosed brain metastases.
The median survival from the time of diagnosis with
metastatic melanoma was 15.8 months for patients
who had brain metastases and 11.1 months for those
without central nervous system involvement (P 5 .26;
log-rank test; P 5 .075; Gehan-Wilcoxon test).
With regard to the safety of this regimen, the
combination of single-agent, oral, extended-schedule
temozolomide with HD IL-2 was tolerated well. No
patient had treatment terminated because of adverse
events. No patient required the delay of an IL-2 treatment cycle because of toxicities related to temozolomide. There were no treatment-related deaths.
HD IL-2 continues to be a rare therapeutic
approach that offers durable, although infrequent,
responses in advanced metastatic melanoma, and
combinations with this agent at high dosage are reasonable in the effort to improve efficacy. In a recent
phase 1/2 clinical trial of HD IL-2 and escalating
doses of anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (antiCTLA-4) antibody (ipilimumab, MDX-010; Medarex,
Inc./Bristol-Myers Squibb Company) in 36 patients
with metastatic melanoma, 22% experienced objective tumor responses, including 3 CRs and 5 PRs.41
Although the response rate observed in that study
was not superior to the responses observed with HD
IL-2 alone, further exploration using modified, sequential approaches is reasonable with anti-CTLA4
blockade or other emerging novel agents.
The current results indicated that it is safe to
administer HD IL-2 sequentially in combination with
single-agent temozolomide in an extended schedule
and that the combination has lower toxicity than
previously used BCT regimens. However, the overall
response rate and the number of durable responses
induced by this combination did not exceed the
results obtained with single-agent HD IL-2. The marginal activity of current single agents may be a part

TMZ and HD IL-2 for Metastatic Melanoma/Tarhini et al

of this problem of limited activity, and exploration of
combinations that have greater impact on this disease with HD IL-2 using new and promising biotherapeutic agents may induce more clinically effective
cell-mediated immune responses.
