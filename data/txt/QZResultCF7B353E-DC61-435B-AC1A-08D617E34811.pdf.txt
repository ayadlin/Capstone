BACKGROUND: In patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), several studies have demonstrated a positive
correlation between somatic mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain and
clinical outcomes with the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, some patients with wild-type (WT)
EGFR also responded to EGFR TKIs and remained stable. Recently, amphiregulin (AR) has been suggested as a predictive marker for EGFR TKIs in patients with WT EGFR-positive NSCLC. The objective of the current study was to
evaluate the association between AR expression and the efficacy of using EGFR TKIs in the treatment of patients
with WT EGFR-positive NSCLC. METHODS: Seventy-three patients with WT EGFR-positive NSCLC received treatment
with gefitinib or erlotinib between May 2005 and December 2008. AR expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: The clinical response to EGFR TKIs was reassessed for all patients as follows: 16 of 73 patients
had a partial response (21.9%), 12 patients had stable disease (16.5%), and 45 patients had progressive disease
(61.6%). AR expression was positive in 24 of 40 patients (60%). The ability to achieve disease control did not differ
significantly between AR-positive patients and AR-negative patients (P ¼ .188). At a median follow-up of 25.4 months
(range, 10.5-53.3 months), progression-free survival was 8.1 weeks in AR-positive patients and 4 weeks in AR-negative
patients (P ¼ .025), and overall survival was significantly longer in AR-positive patients than in AR-negative patients
(12.2 months vs 4.1 months; P ¼ .001). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that patients with WT EGFRpositive NSCLC who have AR-positive tumors may benefit clinically from treatment with EGFR TKIs, indicating that
AR expression may be a potential marker for the selection of EGFR-TKI treatment for patients with WT EGFR-posiC 2010 American Cancer Society.

Nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Platinum-based combination regimens as a first-line treatment have offered a modest survival advantage in patients with advanced NSCLC, but
most patients eventually experienced disease progression.1
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib and erlotinib, as molecularly targeted agents, are used commonly, and several large, randomized trials have demonstrated a survival benefit for
patients with NSCLC who progressed on previous chemotherapy.2-5 Compared with other cytotoxic agents like docetaxel
or pemetrexed, EGFR TKIs can be maintained for a long time because of their low toxicity and good tolerability.2,6
Although the response rate with EGFR TKIs in unselected patients with NSCLC was <10%, disease control was achieved

by >40% of patients.4 It is well known that patients who
have an activating EGFR mutation (exons 18-21) achieve
a higher response rate and prolongation of progressionfree survival (PFS) when they receive EGFR TKIs.7-12
Therefore, EGFR mutation is considered a predictive
marker for response and PFS. It is noteworthy that some
patients with wild-type (WT) EGFR also have a response
to EGFR TKIs and maintain stable disease (SD), suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved. Thus, several
biomarkers have been investigated in WT EGFR-positive
NSCLC. The high gene copy numbers of EGFR, v-erbb2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2
(HER-2), and ErbB-3 are associated with sensitivity to
gefitinib.13-15
In contrast to EGFR expression, EGFR ligand
expression has not been a focus of study because there are
so many ligands for EGFR, such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-a),
amphiregulin (AR), epiregulin, betacelluin, and heparinbinding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF). Recently, a
role for AR has been suggested in tumor growth and survival in which AR stimulates an autocrine loop through
EGFR in various cancers.16-18 The binding of AR to
EGFR induces autophosphorylation of the EGFR intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, which activates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 1 and 2 (MEK/ERK1/2) pathway and the phosphoinositide 3-kinanse/protein kinase B (PI3K/AKT)
pathway. Consequently, cancer cells have growth, proliferation, migration, or invasiveness properties after the
activation of EGFR.19 Yonesaka et al reported that the
autocrine production of AR can predict sensitivity to both
gefitinib and cetuximab in WT EGFR cancers.18 Also,
increased amphiregulin levels in serum were associated
with a poor response to gefitinib in patients with advanced
NSCLC.20 However, to date, a definite correlation
between AR and response to EGFR-TKIs has not been
fully established. Thus, the objective of the current study
was to evaluate the association between AR expression and
the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in patients with WT EGFRpositive NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Treatment
Between May 2005 and December 2008, 140 patients
who received EGFR-TKI treatment and also had
adequate tissue samples available for EGFR mutation testing were analyzed. Initially, DNA direct sequencing was

144

used and reconfirmed by peptide nucleic acid-locked
nucleic acid polymerase chain reaction clamp. Sixty-seven
of 140 patients (47.9%) had an EGFR-activating mutation of exon 19 deletion or L858R. The high EGFR
mutation rate is attributed to the enriched patient population, which had favorable clinical parameters. Seventythree patients (52.1%) had the WT EGFR gene. Patients
received either gefitinib or erlotinib at their physician’s
discretion. All patients had histologically confirmed,
advanced/metastatic or recurrent NSCLC. Oral gefitinib
was given daily at a dose of 250 mg per day, and oral erlotinib was given at a dose of 150 mg per day on a treatment
cycle of 4 weeks. These EGFR TKIs were continued until
patients developed disease progression or unacceptable
toxicity. Response evaluation was assessed according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version
1.0) guidelines.21 Response was evaluated every 6 weeks
or 8 weeks during chemotherapy with a chest computed
tomography scan. Forty tissue samples from the 73
patients were available for AR expression analysis. Specimens were collected by lymph node biopsy,11 gun
biopsy,4 bronchoscopic biopsy,8 pleural biopsy,3 and
surgical specimen.14 This analysis was approved by the
Samsung Medical Center institutional review board.
Immunohistochemistry for
Amphiregulin Expression
Histologic sections were cut from previously formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded blocks for immunohistochemical staining. These formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were sectioned to 4 lm thickness. Then, the
tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene and rehydrated in serially graded alcohol. AR antigen retrieval consisted of heating in 10 mM citrate buffer, pH 6.0, with
microwaves (for 15 minutes at 700 W) and cooling to
room temperature for 20 minutes. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the slides were preincubated
in 5% normal blocking solution (goat serum) for 10
minutes to reduce nonspecific binding. Then, the slides
were incubated overnight at 4 C with goat anti-AR
(AF262; R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn) at a 1:50
dilution in a humidified chamber. The primary antibody
was observed with a 2-step, biotin-free polymer-horseradish peroxidase detection system (Golden Bridge International, Mukilteo, Wash). Finally, the sections were
washed again in PBS, and color development was achieved
using 3,30 -diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Golden
Bridge International). Finally, the sections were counterstained with Mayer hematoxylin.

Evaluation of Immunostaining
Immunohistochemical evaluations were performed independently by pathologists (C.-K.J. and Y.-L.C.) who had
no knowledge of the clinical data. AR immunoreactivity
levels in each section were assessed under a light microscope. Representative areas of the images were acquired at
400 magnification for each specimen. Tumor staining
intensity was graded on a scale from 0 to 4, and the fraction of cell staining ranged from 0% to 100%. Then, this
fraction score was multiplied by the staining intensity to
obtain a final ‘‘H score.’’ AR-positive tumors were defined
as those with H scores >100.9,18
Statistical Analysis
Clinical and pathologic variables were compared across
groups using Student t tests and chi-square tests or Fisher
exact tests for continuous and categorical variables. The
duration of overall survival (OS) was calculated from the
first date of EGFR-TKI treatment until the date of either
death or the most recently documented follow-up. Progression-free survival (PFS) was calculated from the first
date of EGFR-TKI treatment to the date when disease
progression was recognized or the date of last follow-up.
OS and PFS were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier
method. Comparisons between groups were performed
using the log-rank test for time-to-event variables. P
values <.05 were considered statistically significant.
Multivariate analysis of the independent predictive or
prognostic factors for survival was performed using a
backward, stepwise method (likelihood-ratio statistics
based on the conditional parameter estimate: conditional
likelihood ratio) of the Cox proportional hazard regression model with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
The median age of the 73 patients was 59 years (range,
33-82 years), and 53.4% of patients were women. Fiftyeight patients had adenocarcinoma (79.5%), and 50
patients were never smokers (68.5%). The treatment lines
were as follows: 5 patients (6.9%) received an EGFR TKI
as neoadjuvant therapy, 15 patients (20.5%) received an
EGF TKI as first-line therapy, 43 patients (58.9%)
received an EGFR TKI as second-line therapy, and 10
patients (13.7%) received an EGFR TKI as third-line or
later therapy. Fifty-three patients received erlotinib, and
20 patients received gefitinib (Table 1).

months (95% CI, 8.2-14.8 months) for all 73 patients,
and 45 patients (61.6%) had died.
Assessment of Amphiregulin Expression
Forty of 73 patients were available for an immunohistochemical study of AR expression. In these patients, AR
expression was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm.
All normal pneumocytes were unstained by AR, but bronchial epithelial cells and a small portion of inflammatory
cells were stained partially. We evaluated the intensity
according to a bronchial epithelial cell staining score of
2þ. Representative results are illustrated in Figure 1. No
4þ staining specimens were identified. ‘‘AR positivity’’
was observed in 24 of 40 patients (60%). There were no
significant differences in clinicopathologic parameters,
such as sex, age, performance status, smoking status, histologic type, EGFR-TKI type, or the rate of disease control,

146

between AR-positive patients and AR-negative patients
(Table 2).
Association Between Amphiregulin
Expression and Clinical Outcomes
Twelve of 24 patients with AR-positive (50%) achieved
disease control (complete responses, partial responses, and
SD), whereas only 4 of 16 patients (25%) with AR-negative tumors achieved disease control. It is noteworthy that
8 of 24 patients (33.3%) with AR-positive tumors had
SD, whereas none of the 16 patients with AR-negative
tumors had SD. However, this difference did not reach
statistically difference (P ¼ .188) (Table 2). We analyzed
survival according to the different H scores (100 and
200). When we used a cutoff H score of 200, PFS (P ¼
.899) and OS (P ¼ .311) did not differ significantly.
However, on univariate analysis using a cutoff H score of
100, PFS was 8.1 weeks for patients with AR-positive
tumors and 4 weeks for patients with AR-negative tumors,

and the difference was significant (P ¼ .015) (Fig. 2).
Other factors that affected the prolongation of PFS were
good performance status (P ¼ .019), never smoker (P ¼
.003), adenocarcinoma (P ¼ .013), and the receipt of gefitinib (P ¼ .048) (Table 3). However, in a Cox proportional hazard model, we demonstrated showed that only
being a never smoker (hazard ratio [HR], 0.303; 95% CI,
0.138-0.670; P ¼ .003) was an independent factor for the
prolongation of PFS (Table 4).

the prolongation of survival (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In the current study, the response and disease control rates
with EGFR-TKI treatment were 21.6% and 37.8%,
respectively, in patients with WT EGFR-positive
NSCLC. This result is consistent with our previous study,
which indicated a 16.2% rate of response to erlotinib (11
of 68 patients) among carriers of WT EGFR.12 More
recently, a randomized phase 3 study of first-line, singleagent gefitinib versus gemcitabine plus cisplatin in neversmokers with adenocarcinoma of the lung (the FirstSIGNAL trial) reported a 25.9% response rate (7 of 27
patients) and a 40.7% disease control rate (11 of 27
patients) with gefitinib in patients with WT EGFR.22

Conversely, a large, randomized, phase 3 trial of gefitinib
versus carboplatin-paclitaxel in selected patients with
NSCLC in an Asian population (the I-PASS trial) demonstrated that, in a molecular biomarker analysis, the
response rate for patients with WT EGFR was only
1.1%.11 These discrepant results may be explained by differences in the EGFR mutation detection method. Direct
DNA sequencing was used in our study and other studies,
but a more sensitive amplification-refractory mutation
system (ARMS) in was used in the I-PASS trial. Because
the direct DNA sequencing method still considered the
gold standard for detecting EGFR mutations, further validation and standardization of EGFR mutation tests are be
needed.
We observed that AR expression was positive in 24
of 40 patients (60%) with WT EGFR-positive NSCLC.
In addition, there was a trend toward a higher disease con-

148

trol rate in patients who had AR-positive tumors (50%;
12 of 24 patients) after EGFR-TKI therapy compared
with patients who had AR-negative tumors (25%; 4 of 16
patients). This finding indicates that AR expression may
be considered as another predictive marker for achieving
disease control with EGFR TKIs in patients with WT
EGFR NSCLC. However, because of the retrospective nature of our analysis, the results should be interpreted with
caution and need to be validated in prospective studies
with large numbers of patients.
It is noteworthy that positive AR status was associated with the prolongation of PFS. The PFS of AR-positive patients was 8.1 weeks compared with 4.0 weeks for
AR-negative patients. This favorable outcome may be
attributed plausibly to a higher proportion of SD in ARpositive patients. Eight of 24 patients (33.3%) who had
AR-positive tumors achieved SD compared with no SD
among the 16 patients who had AR-negative tumors.
Moreover, positive AR tumor expression was an independent factor for OS (P ¼ .001). This is consistent with
the observation that patients with high AR tumor

expression have more SD compared with patients who
have low AR tumor expression,18 It has been suggested,
that in WT EGFR NSCLC cell lines with high AR expression, EGFR TKIs cause the inhibition of EGFR downstream signaling not to PI3K/Akt but to ERK1/2, which
participates in growth inhibition and G1-S arrest.18,23
This may explain the mechanism of inducing SD with
EGFR TKIs in patients with WT EGFR-positive tumors.
Therefore, AR-positive tumors may benefit substantially
from EGFR TKIs in the treatment of WT EGFR-positive
NSCLC.
It has been reported that AR overexpression is a
poor prognostic factor in NSCLC.20,24 In breast cancer,
although overexpression of Her2 itself is a poor prognostic
factor, Her2-positive cancer produced better survival than
Her2-negative cancer when patients received trastuzumab.25 Regarding WT EGFR tumors, EGFR signaling by
EGF ligands decreases over time, unlike in tumors that
have an activating EGFR mutation.26 Therefore, the
EGFR downstream signal will be sustained under the condition of overexpressed EGFR ligands like AR. In those
patients, blocking the pathway with EGFR-TKIs can be
useful in controlling WT EGFR tumors. Consequently,
ligand expression may be the driving force for the use of
EGFR-TKI use in patients with WT EGFR-positive
NSCLC.
However, whether increased AR expression can be
used to predict responsiveness to EGFR inhibitors in different types of cancer remains controversial. In patients

Cancer

with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, AR
secretion was correlated positively with sensitivity to gefitinib.23 In patients with colorectal cancer, increased AR
mRNA expression predicted the efficacy of cetuximab,16,27 and the TNF-a-converting enzyme, which is
required for the cell surface proteolytic processing of AR,
has been correlated with the efficacy of EGFR inhibitors
in colorectal cancer.28 In patients with NSCLC, the detection of AR protein by immunohistochemistry has been
associated with sensitivity to gefitinib.18 In contrast,
increased levels of AR in serum were correlated with a
poor response to gefitinib in patients with advanced
NSCLC.20,29 Other investigators have reported that AR
overexpression promotes resistance rather than sensitivity
to gefitinib in patients with NSCLC through inhibition
of the Bcl2-associated X protein BAX.30 These discrepancies may be explained by the heterogeneous methods that
were used to detect AR expression, different cancer types,
and differences in AR distribution between local tumors
and systemic circulation. Thus, currently, the reasons for
this predominance of AR are not clear and need further
study.
This study had several limitations. First, although
we demonstrated that clinical outcomes, such as the disease control rate, PFS, and OS, were better in patients
who had AR-positive tumors compared with patients who
had AR-negative tumors among those with WT EGFRpositive NSCLC, the statistical power was too weak to
generate any conclusion because of the small number of

149

Original Article

patients. Second, because our heterogeneous patient
cohort was analyzed retrospectively, caution should be
exercised in drawing any firm conclusions from the current results. Thus, further prospective studies with more
patients will be needed to validate the role of AR expression in patients with WT EGFR-positive NSCLC. In
conclusion, the current study indicated that patients with
WT EGFR-positive NSCLC may obtain a clinical benefit
from EGFR-TKI treatment because of their AR expression status. These results suggest that AR expression may
be another potential marker for the selection of patients
with WT EGFR-positive NSCLC for EGFR-TKI
treatment.
