Abstract
It has been recently reported that NK012, a 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38)–releasing nanodevice, markedly enhances the antitumor activity of SN-38, especially in hypervascular
tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention
effect. Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a typical hypervascular
tumor with an irregular vascular architecture. We therefore
investigated the antitumor activity of NK012 in a hypervascular
tumor model from RCC. Immunohistochemical examination
revealed that Renca tumors contained much more CD34positive neovessels than SKRC-49 tumors. Compared with CPT11, NK012 had significant antitumor activity against both bulky
Renca and SKRC-49 tumors. Notably, NK012 eradicated rapidgrowing Renca tumors in 6 of 10 mice, whereas it failed to
eradicate SKRC-49 tumors. In the pulmonary metastasis
treatment model, an enhanced and prolonged distribution of
free SN-38 was observed in metastatic lung tissues but not in
nonmetastatic lung tissues after NK012 administration. NK012
treatment resulted in a significant decrease in metastatic
nodule number and was of benefit to survival. Our study shows
the outstanding advantage of polymeric micelle-based drug
carriers and suggests that NK012 would be effective in treating
disseminated RCCs with irregular vascular architectures.

Introduction
Passive targeting of the drug delivery system is suited to
combating the pathophysiologic characteristics present in many
solid tumors: hypervascularity, irregular vascular architecture,
potential for secretion of vascular permeability factors, and the
absence of effective lymphatic drainage that prevents efficient
clearance of macromolecules. These characteristics, unique to solid
tumors, are believed to be the basis of the enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect (1). Polymeric micelle-based anticancer
drugs have recently been developed (2, 3), and some were put
under evaluation for clinical trials (4, 5).
7-Ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN-38), a biological active
metabolite of irinotecan hydrochloride (CPT-11), has potent
antitumor activity, but has not been used clinically because it is
a water-insoluble drug. It has been recently shown that novel
SN38-incorporated polymeric micelles, NK012, have the potential

to allow effective sustained release of SN-38 inside a tumor and
possess potent antitumor activities especially in a vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF)–secreting hypervascular tumor
(6), because the supramolecular structures of NK012 which enable
SN-38 to accumulate in the target tissue are based on the EPR
effect (1).
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a typical hypervascular tumor
with an irregular vascular architecture. We therefore conducted an
investigation to determine whether NK012 would be effective in
treating RCC by using established RCC tumor models with
pulmonary metastasis.

Materials and Methods
Drugs and cells. CPT-11 was purchased from Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd.
SN-38 and NK012 was prepared and supplied by Nippon Kayaku Co., Ltd.
(6). Five human RCC lines (SKRC-49, Caki-1, 769P, 786O, and KU19-20) and
murine Renca cells were maintained in DMEM or MEM supplemented
with 2 mmol/L glutamine, 1% nonessential amino acids, 100 units/mL
streptomycin and penicillin, and 10% FCS.
In vitro growth inhibition assay. The growth inhibitory effects of
NK012, SN-38, and CPT-11 were examined with a 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, as described previously (6).
In vivo growth inhibition assay. The animal experimental protocols
were approved by the Committee for Ethics of Animal Experimentation,
and the experiments were conducted in accordance with the Guidelines
for Animal Experiments in the National Cancer Center. Athymic nude mice
(3–4 wk old) were maintained in a laminar air flow cabinet under aseptic
conditions. 107 RCC cells were s.c. injected into the backs of the mice.
NK012 at doses of 10 mg/kg/d or 20 mg/kg/d and CPT-11 at doses of
15 mg/kg/d or 30 mg/kg/d were given i.v. on days 0 (when tumors were
allowed to grow until they became massive in size, around 1.5 cm), 4, and 8.
Tumor volume was determined by direct measurement with calipers and
calculated as p/6  (large diameter)  (small diameter)2.
Assessment of treatment effects of NK012 on murine pulmonary
metastasis model. A total of 1  105 Renca cells were inoculated into
male BALB/c mice via the tail vein. The mice were randomly divided into
three groups of 10. NK012 at dose of 20 mg/kg/d and CPT-11 at dose of
30 mg/kg/d were given i.v. on days 0 (7 d after inoculation), 4, and 8. After
that, the mice were sacrificed, their lungs were stained intratracheally with
15% India black ink solution, and the number of metastatic nodules in
each mouse was counted. To determine the effect of NK012 on survival, an
identical experiment to the one described above was done. After treatment,
mice were maintained until each animal showed signs of morbidity (i.e.,
over 10% weight loss compared with untreated controls), at which point
they were sacrificed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was done to determine the
effect on time to morbidity, and statistical differences were ranked
according to a Mantel-Cox log-rank test using the StatView 5.0 software
package.
Histologic and immunohistochemical analysis. Histologic sections
were taken from Renca tumor tissues. After extirpation, tissues were fixed
with 3.9% formalin in PBS (pH 7.4), and the subsequent preparations and
H&E staining were performed by Tokyo Histopathological Laboratory Co.,

Ltd. Monoclonal anti-CD34 antibody (HyCult Biotechnology) was used to
detect the tumor blood vessels. CD34-positive neovessels were counted in
10 high-power fields (400) by two independent investigators who operated
in a blinded fashion.
Assay for free (polymer-unbound) SN-38 in lung tissues. The Renca
pulmonary metastasis model described above was used for the analysis of
the biodistribution of NK012 and CPT-11. Ten days after Renca inoculation,
NK012 (20 mg/kg) or CPT-11 (30 mg/kg) was given i.v. to the mice. The
mice were sacrificed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after administration, and lung
samples were taken and stored at 80jC until analysis. We prepared
control mice without Renca inoculation as the nonmetastatic model;
NK012 was administrated as well, and lung samples were stored. Samples
were then homogenized on ice using a Digital homogenizer (Iuchi) and
suspended in the mixture of 100 mmol/L glycine-HCl buffer (pH 3)/
methanol (1:1, v/v) at a concentration of 5% w/w. Proteins were precipitated
with an ice-cold mixture of 1 mmol/L H3PO4/MeOH/H2O (1:1:4, v/v/v)
containing camptothecin as an I.S. The sample was vortexed for 10 s and
filtered through a MultiScreen Solvinert (Millipore Corporation), and the
concentration of free SN-38 in the aliquots of the homogenates (100 AL) was
determined using the high-performance liquid chromatography method (6).
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean F SD. Significance of
differences was calculated using the unpaired t test with repeated measures
of StatView 5.0. P < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.

Results and Discussion
We first evaluated in vitro cellular sensitivity of RCC lines to
SN-38, NK012, and CPT-11. The IC50 values of each agent for RCC
lines are shown in Table 1. NK012 exhibited higher cytotoxic effect

against each cell line compared with CPT-11 (96-fold to 406-fold
sensitive).
It is essential to elucidate the correlation between the
effectiveness of micellar drugs and tumor hypervascularity and
hyperpermeability. Gross evaluation of those RCC tumors s.c.
injected into the backs of mice revealed that Renca tumors were
more reddish and grew faster than SKRC-49 tumors, and immunohistochemical examination showed that Renca tumors
contained much more CD34-positive neovessels than SKRC-49
tumors (Fig. 1).
We allowed the tumors to grow until they became massive,
around 1.5 cm, and then initiated treatment. A striking decrease
in Renca tumor volume was observed on day 15 in mice treated
with NK012 at 20 mg/kg/d compared with the untreated control
(Fig. 2A). Renca bulky masses completely disappeared on day 21 in
6 of 10 mice treated with NK012 at 20 mg/kg/d. On the other hand,
Renca tumors in mice treated with CPT-11 at 30 mg/kg/d were not
eradicated and rapidly regrew after a partial response at day 15.
An approximate 10% body weight loss occurred in mice treated
with NK012 20 mg/kg, compared with the untreated controls, but
there was no significant difference in comparison with tumor-free
mice treated with NK012, suggesting that the decrease in body
weight was likely to be due to tumor shrinkage rather than toxic
effects. We next compared the antitumor activities of the NK012
and CPT-11 treatment in SKRC-49 and Renca tumors. The SKRC-49
tumor volume in mice treated with NK012 at 20 mg/kg/d on day 21
was over 70% smaller than in the untreated controls on day 21
and f50% smaller than in mice on day 0 (Fig. 2B). However, the
SKRC-49 tumors were not eradicated in mice treated with NK012.
Considering that equivalent in vitro growth inhibitory effects by
NK012 were observed for SKRC-49 and Renca cells (Table 1),
our results suggest that the antitumor activity of NK012 in vivo
might be affected by tumor environment factors, such as tumor
vascularity.
We next examined the distribution of free SN-38 in the
metastatic or nonmetastatic (no inoculation of Renca cells) lung
tissues after administration of NK012 or CPT-11. In the case of
NK012 administration in mice with lung metastasis, free SN-38 was
detectable at the concentration of >100 ng/g in metastatic lung
tissues with a typical microvascular architecture (Fig. 3A) even at
72 hours after administration, whereas the concentrations of free
SN-38 in nonmetastatic lung tissues after NK012 administration
were much lower than those in metastatic lung tissues after
treatment with NK012 (significant at 24, 48, and 72 hours; P < 0.05;

Fig. 3B). On the other hand, the concentrations of free SN-38 after
administration of CPT-11 were almost negligible in metastatic lung
tissues at all time points (data not shown). These results strongly
suggest that SN-38 could be selectively released from NK012 and
maintained in metastatic Renca tumor tissues.
Deviating from the ordinary experimental pulmonary metastasis
prevention model, we initiated treatment 7 days after inoculation
(day 0) when multiple lung nodules derived from Renca were
observed in all mice in our preliminary study (Fig. 4A). On day 21,
there was no significant difference between the mean number of

metastatic nodules in the control group (287 F 56 nodules, n = 10)
and in the group receiving CPT-11 treatment (236 F 59 nodules,
n = 10). Significant treatment effects were found, however, in the
group receiving NK012 treatment (32 F 18 nodules, n = 10) on
day 21 compared with the control group on day 21 (P < 0.0001).
Notably, a dramatic decrease in metastatic nodule number was
observed in the NK012 treatment group on day 21 compared with
the control group on day 0 (126 F 23 nodules, n = 10, P < 0.001;
Fig. 4A). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a significant survival
benefit was obtained in the NK012 treatment group compared with

the control group (P < 0.001), but no significant survival benefit
was obtained in CPT-11 treatment group (P = 0.239; Fig. 4B).
Although no severe toxic effects were observed in any mouse
treated with NK012, 3 of 10 mice treated with NK012 were
sacrificed during the observation period according to the
¶Guidelines for Animal Experiments because their body weights
had become 10% lower than those of the other mice. However,
the sacrificed mice were a little bit smaller than others when they
started treatment, and they showed no disseminated lung
metastasis (data not shown).
Our results presented here strongly support recent findings
reported by us that the macromolecular drug distribution
throughout the tumor site was enhanced by the hypervascularity
and hyperpermeability, and subsequently higher antitumor activity
was achieved (6). We assume that conventional low molecular size
anticancer agents almost disappear from the bloodstream without
being subjected to the EPR effect before they can reach the target
organs (solid tumor). The clinical importance of angiogenesis in
human tumors has been shown in several reports indicating a
positive relationship between the blood vessel density in the tumor
mass and poor prognosis with chemoresistance in patients with
various cancers (7–9). Furthermore, recent reports showing that
anticancer agents were less active against VEGF-overexpressing
tumors (10, 11) may support the idea that low-molecular drugs are
not so effective in the treatment of solid tumors which are rich in
blood vessels.
Our study thus far has several limitations about clarifying
whether extensive angiogenesis in the tumor is an essential
determinant for the susceptibility to NK012. In our ongoing study,
we found that NK012 also has a striking antitumor activity against
some hypovascular tumor models of human pancreatic cancer

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (6). March 15, 2008

xenografts.5 It also remains unclear whether NK012 possesses
strong antitumor activity in other metastatic sites besides the lung.
It is known that the EPR effect is affected by various permeability
factors, such as bradykinin (12), nitric oxide (13). and various
cytokines independent of VEGF and hypervascularity (14). Among
solid tumors with rapid progression potential, irregularity occurs
not only in blood flow and vascular density, but also in the vascular
network and anatomic architecture (15, 16), suggesting that
EPR effect may be predominantly promoted in rapid-progressive
tumor phenotypes and influenced by organ-specific tumor
microenvironment. Hoffman and coworkers (17, 18) have developed a technique of surgical orthotopic implantation (SOI) with
more clinical features of systemic and aggressive metastases than
our conventional animal models. Further preclinical studies using
such models as SOI might clarify cancer phenotypes and metastatic
organs to which we can apply NK012 more precisely.
The results of chemotherapy in RCCs have been disappointing,
as indicated by the low response proportions. However, clinical
trials using gemcitabine-containing regimens have been encouraging, with major responses occurring in 5% to 17% of patients
(19, 20), suggesting the possibility that chemotherapy is promising
as a modality for RCC therapy if anticancer agents can be
selectively delivered, released, and maintained around tumor
tissues. Our current report highlights the advantages of polymeric
micelle-based drug carriers like NK012 as promising modalities
for treatment, rather than prevention, of disseminated RCCs with
abnormal vascular architecture. The results of our ongoing phase-I
