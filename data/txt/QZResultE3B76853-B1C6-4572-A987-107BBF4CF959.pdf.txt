ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the worst prognoses among all
the malignancies. Now, gemcitabine (Gem) is the first line chemotherapeutic drug
for advanced pancreatic cancer. However, Gem is usually ineffective to the PDAC
because of high degree of drug resistance. Hypoxia and immune suppressive milieu
are the best-described hallmarks of PDAC; therefore, we investigated the impact of
hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) inhibitor, PX-478, in combination with Gem on the
induction of immunogenic cell death (ICD). We verified that combined treatment with
Gem/PX-478 significantly enhanced the anti-tumor effect and increased proportion
of tumor infiltrating T-lymphocytes in Panc02-bearing immune-competent but not
in immune-deficient mice. Vaccination using Panc02 cell line treated with single
agent or in combination showed significant anti-tumor effects. Pancreatic cell lines
treated with Gem and PX-478 can induce an increase in eIF2α phosphorylation was
correlated with down-regulation of HIF-1α and elicited exposure of CRT and release of
HMGB1 and ATP. Only co-treated cells induced DC maturation/phagocytosis and IFN-γ
secretion by cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Altogether, combined treatment with Gem/PX478 showed significantly inhibition on tumor growth and anti-tumor immunization. We
propose that inhibition HIF-1α elicits Gem-induced immune response and eliminates
PDAC cells by inducing ICD.

INTRODUCTION

new treatment strategies are urgently needed to improve
the prognosis of patients with PDAC.
We have previously demonstrated that hypoxiainducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays crucial roles in the
pathogenesis and progression of pancreatic cancer [7,
8]. Initially identified as a critical transcription factor
mediating cell adaption to hypoxia [9], it was recently
found that HIF-1α is overexpressed in pancreatic cancer
even under normoxia condition and levels of HIF1α are positively correlated with tumor progression,
angiogenesis, cell migration and poor prognosis [7,
8, 10, 11]. Therefore, inhibition of HIF-1α expression
could be a therapeutic target to control this aggressive
disease. Importantly, it was reported that HIF-1α is highly

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one
of the most aggressive human neoplasms, with an overall
5-year survival rate of less than 5% [1]. Even the patients
obtained radical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy,
the 5-year survival rate is between 15 % and 25 % [2].
Compared to other malignancies, pancreatic cancer is
highly resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy
[3, 4]. Currently, the standard treatment for advanced
pancreatic cancer is single-agent gemcitabine (Gem) [5].
However, the clinical effect of Gem remains modest due to
an inherent and acquired chemo-resistance [6]. Therefore,

expressed in Gem-resistant pancreatic cancer cells and
this is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
of cancer cells [12], suggesting that inhibition of HIF-1α
may have potential to overcome the resistance of PDAC
cells to the treatment with Gem. PX-478 (S-2-amino-3[4V-N,N,-bis(2-chloroethyl) amino]-phenyl propionic
acid N-oxide dihydrochloride) is a specific agent that
suppresses constitutive and hypoxia-induced levels of
HIF-1α in cancer cells [13, 14]. Recent clinical trials have
shown that PX-478 achieved a relatively high disease
control ratio in the treatment of advanced cancer and 90%
of patients were well tolerated to the reagent (Phase I Trial
of PX-478, NCT00522652). Thus, combination of Gem
with PX-478 may have a potential strategy to improve the
efficacy of Gem therapy in patients with pancreatic cancer.
In order to achieve effective treatment,
chemotherapy should improve anti-cancer immunity
and alleviate intra-tumoral immunosuppression [15,
16]. Recently, immunogenic cell death (ICD) has
been considered as the best way to induce an adaptive
immune response and improve the efficacy of anticancer treatment [17-19]. ICD is a cell death modality
that stimulate an immune response against dead-cell
antigens and is featured by (1) the dying cell exposure
of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs)
including calreticulin (CRT) and/or heat shock proteins
(HSPs) in pre- or early apoptotic stages; (2) the pre- or
early apoptotic secretion of ATP; and (3) the late apoptotic
passive release of non-histone chromatin protein high
mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and possibly of HSP70
and HSP90 [18-20]. DAMPs exposure leads to the specific
recognition by antigen presenting cells (APCs), i.e.,
dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which become
mature and prime the tumor specific T and natural killer
(NK) cells to react against tumor cell antigens [21, 22].
There is limited information on which
chemotherapeutic agents can induce ICD in pancreatic
cancer. The capacity of Gem on inducing ICD in
PDAC is currently debated [23, 24] and it may require
a complementary approach to trigger this process [24].
Numerous reports demonstrated that inhibition of HIF-1α
could overcome resistance of tumor cells to chemotherapy
[25, 26]. Recently, it has been proposed that inhibition of
HIF-1α could be a complementary approach for cancer
immunotherapy [27]. However, whether HIF-1α inhibitors
could promote ICD has not been defined.
In our own studies, we have found that HIF1α is overexpressed in patients with PDAC [7, 8]. We
hypothesize that inhibition of HIF-1α could enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of Gem. In this study, we aimed
to compare the efficacies of PX-478 (a specific HIF1α inhibitor) and chemotherapy drug Gem, as a single
agent or in combination, in inducing anti-tumor immune
response and immunogenic elimination of PDAC tumor
in immune-competent and immune-deficient PDACengrafted mice. Gem and/or PX-478-induced ICD

markers and immune response, including DC maturation/
phagocytosis, and activity of cytotoxic T-cells were
determined accordingly in vitro.

RESULTS
PX-478 enhances the therapeutic efficacy of Gem
only in the immune-competent mice models
In vitro experiments showed that inhibition of
HIF1α by PX-478 sensitized PDAC cells lines to GEM
induced apoptosis (data not shown). To evaluate the
antineoplastic effects of this combination in vivo, we
implanted Panc02 cells in immune-competent C57BL/6
and immune-deficient nude mice and treated them with
Gem and/or PX-478. Gem or PX-478 alone significantly
reduced tumor growth in both immune-competent and
incompetent mice (Figure 1) and there was no significant
difference when either single treatment efficacy was
compared between two mice models. When Gem
combined with PX-478, the tumor suppression effect of
Gem or PX-478 was significantly increased in immunecompetent in C57BL/6 mice (Figure 1A, B and C) but
not in nude mice (Figure 1 D, E and F) compared with
treated with Gem alone. This suggests that the therapeutic
efficacy of this combined treatment with Gem and PX478 may depend on the presence of thymus-dependent T
lymphocytes because it was deficient in nude mice. These
results indicate that Gem and PX-478 combination may
induce a tumor antigen-specific immune response which
in turn elicits elimination of tumor cells.

Combination of PX-478 with Gem significantly
increases the vaccine efficacy compared with
single treatment
To further confirm whether Gem plus PX-478 (Gem/
PX-478) combination can elicit immune response, we
vaccinated immune-competent C57BL/6 mice with Panc02
cells which were treated with Gem, PX-478 or Gem/PX478. After one week, the mice were challenged on the
other flank with live Panc02 cells. None of the C57BL/6
mice developed tumors on the vaccinated flank. All the
mice in the non-immunized group developed tumors at
the challenge site and died within 17 days. Either Gem or
PX-478-immunized group showed significantly reduced
tumor volumes (P<0.001) compared with non-vaccinated
group and died within 25 days. Most strikingly, Gem/PX478-immunized mice showed significantly reduced tumor
volumes (P<0.001), and 5 in 8 of mice were alive at 60
days post challenge (Figure 2A, B and C). The survival
rate was significantly increased in the Gem/PX-478 group
(P<0.001) (Figure 2D). These results demonstrate, for the

and determined by flow cytometry. The proportions of
CD3+ and CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes in Gem/PX478 group were not significantly increased in peripheral
blood compared with treated with either Gem or PX-478
group (Figure 3A and B). However, significantly increased
cytotoxic CD3+/CD8+ T lymphocytes were detected in
spleen (Figure 3C and D) and tumor tissues (Figure 3E and
F) in mice treated with Gem/PX-478 compared with single
treatment (Figure 3 and Suppl Figure 1). Collectively, the
data suggest that chemotherapy with Gem/PX-478 may
eliminate tumor cells by tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic T
lymphocytes-mediated ICD.

Inhibition of HIF-1α sensitizes PDAC cells to Gem
or OXP-induced phosphorylation of eIF2α

P-eIF2α. Combination of PX-478 with either Gem or OXP
led to maximum inhibition of HIF-1α and up-regulation
of P-eIF2 α (Figure 4B). Treatment-induced changes in
HIF-1α and P-eIF2α showed strong negative correlation,
P<0.01, γ=-0.943 (Figure 4C). To further evaluate the
effect of HIF-1 inhibition on ICD, PDAC cells were either
transfected with HIF-1α-siRNA or treated with another
HIF-1α inhibitor 2-Methoxyestradiol (2-ME) (Selleck.
cn). As expected, both HIF-1α-siRNA and 2-ME induced
eIF2α phosphorylation in PDAC cells (Figure 4D). These
results demonstrate that inhibition of HIF-1α expression
could trigger ICD by up-regulation P- eIF2α.

We questioned whether the sensitization effect
of PX-478 on ICD inducers is due to inhibition of HIF1α. Induction of surface exposure of CRT (ecto-CRT) is
one of the hallmarkers of ICD [28-30] and it occurs as
a consequence of ER stress-induced phosphorylation
of eIF2α [18, 19, 31]. Ecto-CRT was stained on nonpermeabilized cells which had been treated individually
as indicated. Gem or PX-478 alone had weaker effect on
triggering CRT exposure but treatment with Gem/PX478 showed strong induction of CRT surface exposure
(Figure 4A). To determine the association between HIF1α inhibition and eIF2α phosphorylation, treatmentinduced alterations of HIF-1α, CRT, P-eIF2α and eIF2α
protein expression were monitored in 5 PDAC cell lines.
A typical ICD inducer, OXP (oxaliplatin) [18, 19] was
used as a positive control. While none of these reagents
induced changes in CRT and eIF2α expression, all of them
mediated down-regulation of HIF-1α and up-regulation of

in the nucleus. Treatment with either Gem or PX-478 alone
induced a translocation of HMGB1 from the nucleus to the
cytoplasm. Co-treatment with Gem/PX-478 caused a loss
of HMGB1 in the nucleus (Figure 5A). Western blotting
confirmed that treatment with Gem/PX-478 induced
maximum HMGB1 release compared with other treatment
(Figure 5B). Similarly to HMGB1 release, Gem/PX-478
induced a significantly increased ATP release (P<0.001)
in all 5 PDAC cell lines compared with other groups
(Figure 5C). In summary, these data demonstrate that in
the presence of HIF-1α inhibitor PX-478, GEM gains its

supernatants from Gem or Gem/PX-478 treated cells for
another 24 hours. Maturation of DCs was determined
by expression of CD80 or CD83 using flow cytometry.
Treatment with Gem/PX-478 significantly increased
expression of both CD83 (Figure 6A) and CD80 (Figure
6B), indicating of maturation of DCs. To determine the
phagocytosis single of ecto-CRT, iDCs (treated with GMCSF and IL-4 for 5 days) were co-cultured with pancreatic
cancer cells treated with saline, Gem, PX-478, or Gem/
PX-478 for 24 hours. And then, fluorescence microscopy
was used to evaluate the phagocytosis of DCs. DCs
activated with Gem/PX-478-treated cells showed more
phagocytosis activity compared with single treatment, as
shown by double positive, or yellow coloured cells (Figure
6C). Most importantly, the co-culture Gem/PX-478

CD8+ T cells significantly increased the secretion of IFN-γ
by cytotoxic T-cells compared with control and those
treated with single agent (Figure 6D). Taken together,

has only a 5.4% partial response rate and most patients
do not respond well to single agent Gem and almost
all the patients finally develop drug resistance [34].
Immunosuppression-induced by tumor microenvironment
is one of the causes of failure in response to the treatment
with Gem [33]. To promote the therapeutic effect of Gem,
one rational approach is to combat drug-resistance by
inducing ICD.
HIF-1α is an important transcription factor for tumor
growth, invasion, angiogenesis, metabolism and drug
resistance [7, 10, 25]. Typically, Gem-resistant pancreatic
cancer cells overexpress HIF-1α that mediates acquired
drug tolerance and tumor progression [12, 35]. Therefore,
inhibition of HIF-1α would be a promising therapeutic
strategy to strengthen the efficacy of Gem. We initially
found that inhibition of HIF-1α by PX-478 increased
the sensitivity of PDAC cells to Gem-induced apoptosis
in vitro (data not show). Indeed, combination with PX478 significantly increased inhibitory effect of Gem on

DISCUSSION
PDAC is highly resistant to both conventional
and targeted chemotherapy. Increased numbers of
circulating regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor
cells and tumor-associated macrophages in the PDAC
microenvironment suppress immune surveillance and
dampen anti-tumor immune responses [32, 33]. Here we
demonstrate, for the first time, that inhibition of HIF-1α
expression by PX-478 enhances immunogenicity of Gem
and elicits tumor-specific DC phagocytic and cytotoxic T
cell responses to PDAC cells.
Although Gem is currently used as a first-line
chemotherapeutic drug for advanced pancreatic cancer, it

tumor growth in PDAC-engrafted immune-competent
mice. However, PX-478 did not improve the efficacy of
Gem in an immune-deficient mice model. To confirm the
immunogenic effect of this combination, we vaccinated
treatment-induced dead cells to immune-competent mice
and found that cells treated with Gem/PX-478 showed
greater effect on eliminating tumor cells compared with
vaccinated with cells treated with single agent. Most
strikingly, more than half of mice after challenged with
Gem/PX-478-treated cells reached long-term survival
(60 days), indicating that the dead cell antigens-mediated
by Gem/PX-478 can enhance immune surveillance and
trigger anti-tumor immune response. As expected, we
found significantly increased cytotoxic infiltrating T cells
in both spleen and tumor tissues in Gem/PX-478-treated
mice compared with those treated with single agent. PX478 elicited immunogenicity on Gem was also confirmed
by in vitro experiments. Conditioned medium from Gem/
PX-478-treated PDAC cells triggered DC maturation
and tumor-specific phagocytosis capacity and activation
of tumor-specific cytotoxic T-cells but those treated with
single agent showed minimum immunogenicity. These
results indicate that either Gem or PX-478 is not ICD
inducer but Gem obtained immunogenic potential when
HIF-1α is inhibited.
We were interested in whether these treatment
strategies could act differently in inducing ICD markers
on tumor cells. Similar to immune responses, Gem/PX478 showed higher potential in inducing CRT surface

exposure, ATP and HMGB1 release compared with
single treatment. It is known that CRT translocation from
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the out-layer of plasma
membrane depends on an ER stress and associated with
ER kinase (PERK)-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation [18,
19]. We found that PX-478 induced HIF-1α inhibition
is negatively correlated with eIF2α phosphorylation. To
verify whether this effect on eIF2α phosphorylation is
specifically due to inhibition of HIF-1α, we confirmed
this phenomenon by using other HIF-1α inhibitor (2ME) and HIF-1α-siRNA as well. Our results suggest that
HIF-1α pathway might inhibit ER stress and subsequent
CRT exposure. It has been reported that the ER stress is
a consequence of production of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) [36] and HIF-1α can decrease ROS production by
reprogramming glucose metabolism [37]. We postulate
that inhibition of ROS production by HIF-1α might be
a possible mechanism to reduce ER stress. PX-478 also
significantly enhanced Gem-induced ATP release. The
function of ATP is to recruit monocytes and macrophages
to the dying tumor cells and stimulate secretion of
IL-1β, a key cytokine to polarize interferon-gammaproducing CD8+ T cells [38]. In addition, we observed
reduction of HMGB1 from nuclear extracts of PX-478treated cells and concomitant accumulation of HMGB1
in the conditioned medium. HMGB1 is a nuclear protein
mediating stabilization of nucleosomes, DNA repair and
recombination. Extracellular HMGB1 is required for the
immunogenicity of ICD. It binds to the Toll-like receptor

exerting synergistic anticancer activity. Pancreatic cancer cells treated with Gem and PX-478 directly provoke an endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress, leading to the release of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) within the tumor microenvironment
(surface exposure of CRT (ecto-CRT), ATP secretion and HMGB1 release). DAMPs exposure leads to the specific recognition by antigen
presenting cells (APCs), i.e., dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, which become mature and prime the tumor specific T and natural
killer (NK) cells to react against tumor cell antigens. In sum, the combined administration of Gem and PX-478 might activate synergistic
immunological response culminating in improved anticancer immune responses.

4 (TLR-4) on the surface of DC and mediates crosspresentation efficiency [39]. We postulate that plasma
HMGB1 concentration after treatment could also be used
as a marker for predicting therapeutic response to Gem/
PX-478 in patients with pancreatic cancer.
In recent years, new combination chemotherapeutic
strategies gained better clinical benefit compared with
single-agent Gem in pancreatic cancer. In 2011, the
ACCORD-11/PRODIGE-4 trial (a multicenter randomized
control phase III trial) confirmed that FOLFIRINOX
(fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin)
significantly prolonged the overall survival of patients
with metastatic pancreatic cancer, compared with gem
along (11.1 vs 6.8 months), although the safety profile of
FOLFIRINOX was not as favourable as that of singleagent Gem [40]. In 2013, Gem plus nab-paclitaxel
achieved better overall survival (median: 8.5 month
vs 6.7 month) compared with Gem alone, based on a
multinational phase III trial. Soon, the FDA approved Gem
plus nab-paclitaxel as a first line treatment for patients
with pancreatic cancer. Based on these achievements,
combination of GEM and PX-478 provides a promising
strategy to kill pancreatic cancer and need to be enrolled
for clinical trials.
In conclusion, this study verified by both in vivo and
in vitro experiments that combination of Gem with PX478 effectively inhibited tumor growth by inducing ICD in
pancreatic cancer. Gem/PX-478-mediated immunogenicity
is dependent on eIF2α phosphorylation-associated CRT
surface exposure, increased ATP and HMGB1 release.
HIF-1α inhibition plays a key role in this sensitization
on immune responses. Most importantly, we found that
vaccination using Gem/PX-478-treated cells has great
potential to prevent tumorigenesis.

Cell lines, cell culture and in vitro treatment

A total of 3×106 Panc02 cells, untreated or treated
with either Gem and/or PX-478 for 24 hours, dying and
dead cells/supernatant were inoculated subcutaneously
into 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice into the right flank,
whereas 1×106 untreated Panc02 cells were inoculated into
the contralateral flank 7 days later [45, 46]. Animals that
bore tumors in excess of 20–25% of the body mass or
were necrotic, were euthanized.

All mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free
conditions and the animal experiment procedures were
approved by the Ethics Committee of Tianjin Medical
University Cancer Institute and Hospital. Immunocompetent 4-week-old female C57BL/6 mice and
immuno-incompetent nude (Nu/Nu) mice were injected
subcutaneously in the flank with 1×106 Panc02 cells. The
tumor volumes were monitored every five days using
digital callipers. When the tumor size reached 40-80mm3,
mice were assigned into homogenous groups and treated
with Gem (i.p at 15 mg/kg on days 1, 3, 5 every week) [6]
or/and PX-478 (p.o. gavage at 30 mg/kg × 2 consecutive
days) [42]. Tumor volumes were calculated using the
formula π/6 [(short axis in mm)2 × (long axis in mm)] for
comparison of tumor growth [43].

Determination of peripheral and infiltrating CD3+
and CD8+ T lymphocytes
Tumor-bearing animals were euthanized by cervical
dislocation as soon as they presented signs of necrosis.
Peripheral blood was collected from the mice and spleen
cell suspensions were produced by forcing the spleen
through a wire mesh screen. Tumor single-cell suspension
was prepared from tumor by digesting and mechanically
dissociating with a MACS Dissociator (Miltenyi Biotec,
Germany), followed by filtration through a 70-mm nylon
mesh [44]. Cells were then co-stained with PE-anti-CD3
and APC-anti-CD8 antibodies (Biolegend, USA). Surface
expression of CD3 and CD8 were determined by flow
cytometry (BD FACS Canto II, BD, USA).

Human PDAC cell lines CFPAC-1, BxPC-3, Panc1, and MIA-PaCa-2 were obtained from the Cell Bank of
Type Culture Collection of Chinese Academy of Sciences
(Shanghai, China) and the American Type Culture
Collection, respectively. The murine pancreatic cancer
cell line Panc02 [41] was a gift from Prof. Yang SY. Cell
lines were routinely cultured at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2 using Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS). For in vitro treatment, 5 × 105/ml cells in
6-well plate were treated with 1.0 μM Gem (Eli Lilly,
Fegersheim, France) [24], or/and 25 μM PX-478 (MedKoo
Biosciences, Inc, USA) [10, 42] for 24 hours in the routine
culture condition. Cell death was determined by flow
cytometry on Annexin-V/propidium iodide positive cells.

Western blotting
Whole-cell extracts were prepared by lysing cells
with RIPA lysis buffer supplemented with protease
inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Protein concentrations were
quantified using Pierce protein assay kit (Pierce). Cellular
protein lysates (20 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE,
and target proteins were detected by Western blotting
using primary antibodies against CRT, HIF-1α, HMGB1,
2258

eIF2α, phosphorylated eIF2α (P-eIF2α), and β-tubulin
(Suppl Table 1). Specific proteins were visualized using an
enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagent (Pierce).
For determining HMGB1 release, 50 µl of conditioned
culture medium was loaded into each lane of SDS-PAGE
gel and extracellular HMGB1 was detected by Western
blotting using an anti-HMGB1 antibody [47].

min at room temperature in the dark [46]. Nuclei were
stained with DAPI and HMGB1 localization was observed
by fluorescent microscopy.
The anti-tumor phagocytic function of matured
DCs was assessed after DCs or tumor cells were labelled
fluorescently with VybrantTM DiO (V-22886) or DiI
(V-22885) cell-labelling solutions (Life technologies),
respectively. Briefly, tumor cells were treated with Gem
or/and PX-478 for 24 hours after stained with DiI (1:200
dilution). DiO-loaded immature DCs (Day 5) were then
fed with treated tumor cells at a DC/tumor cell ratio of 5:1.
After incubation for 24 hours, the cells were fixed with 4%
paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed in PBS for 20 min
and mounted on slides [49] and viewed under a fluorescent
microscope. Double positive cells were considered as fully
phagocytosed cells.

Preparation of human DCs and T lymphocytes
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) were isolated from healthy donors by FicollHypaque (Solarbio Co., China) density gradient
centrifugation and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS for 2 hours. DCs were generated
from the adherent fraction of PBMCs [48]. The adherent
cells were cultured for 6 days in RPMI 1640 medium
containing 10% FBS, 20 ng/mL human GM-CSF, and 10
ng/mL human IL-4 (Biolegend, USA). Culture medium
and cytokines were refreshed every other day. On the day
6, the medium was replaced by the Gem or/ and PX-478treated conditioned medium or control medium and cell
culture was continued for 24 hours. Autologous CD3+
T lymphocytes were magnetically isolated using CD3
MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotech, Germany) to obtain purity
≥95% CD3+ T cells. The isolated T lymphocytes were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and
10 ng/mL human IL-2 (Biolegend, USA), and the medium
was replaced every other day.

ATP release assay
ATP concentration in the culture medium was
performed using an ATP Determination Kit (Life
technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Cell numbers were set up as 1 × 106/ml for all experiments.
After treatment for 24 hours, 10 µl of conditioned medium
was taken out for ATP assay.

IFN-γ production
IFN-γ secretion from CD3+ T lymphocytes was
assessed by IFN-γ ELISA Kit (Uscn Life Science Inc,
China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Immunostaining and fluorescent microscopy

RNA interference and cell transfection

The surface exposure of CRT was determined by
immunostaining as previously described [28]. Briefly, after
treatment cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed in
0.25% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 5 min. Cells were
then washed with PBS for three times. The rabbit anticalreticulin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) was
diluted in 3% BSA containing blocking buffer at 1:200
dilution and cells were stained with it overnight at 4°C.
After washes in cold PBS, cells were stained with Alexa
Fluor 488-conjugated secondary anti-rabbit antibody (Life
technologies, USA) at 1:500 dilution for 30 min at room
temperature. Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342
before images were viewed under OLYMPUS fluorescent
microscope (Japan).
For determining intracellular HMGB1, cells on
slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min
and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min.
Nonspecific binding was blocked with 3% BSA in PBS
for 30 min. Cells were stained with mouse anti-HMGB1
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) at 1:100 dilution overnight at
4°C. Subsequently, cells were washed three times with
PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated
secondary anti-mouse antibody (Life technologies) for 30

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against HIF1α (Suppl Table 1) was designed and synthesized from
GenePharma (Shanghai, China). Cells were transfected
with HIF-1α-siRNA using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life
Technologies) and knocking-down effect of HIF-1α was
determined by Western blotting after 48 hours.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS
version 18.0 for windows and GraphPad Prism software
(version 5.03). For all in vitro experiments, at least 3
independent experiments were performed. For in vivo
experiments, 5 to 8 mice were used for each group/per
experiment. Data are expressed as mean ± SD. Significant
difference between two groups with equal numbers were
analysed by two-sided Student t-tests and those with
unequal sizes were analysed with the Mann-Whitney U
test. Two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc test was
used to compare restriction of tumor cell growth in vivo
