Abstract
Breast cancers are not responsive to epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), although
30% of breast cancers overexpress EGFR. The mechanism of
intrinsic resistance to EGFR TKIs in breast cancer is the focus
of current studies. Here, we observed that EGFR remains
tyrosine phosphorylated in breast cancer cells that proliferate
in the presence of EGFR TKIs. In one such cell line, SUM229,
inhibiting c-Src kinase activity with either a dominantnegative c-Src or a c-Src TKI decreased EGFR phosphorylation
on Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1086 in the presence of EGFR TKIs.
Conversely, overexpressing wild-type (wt) c-Src in the EGFR
TKI–sensitive breast cancer cell line SUM149 increased EGFR
kinase–independent EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation. In addition, in the presence of EGFR TKIs, inhibiting c-Src kinase
activity decreased cell growth in SUM229 cells, and overexpressing wt-c-Src increased cell growth in SUM149 cells. We
identified the receptor tyrosine kinase Met to be responsible
for activating c-Src in SUM229 cells. Inhibiting Met kinase
activity with a small molecule inhibitor decreased c-Src
phosphorylation and kinase activation. In addition, inhibiting
Met kinase activity in SUM229 cells decreased EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation and growth in the presence of EGFR TKIs.
Stimulating Met kinase activity in SUM149 cells with hepatocyte growth factor increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
and cell growth in the presence of EGFR TKIs. These data
suggest a Met/c-Src–mediated signaling pathway as a mediator of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and cell growth in the
presence of EGFR TKIs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3314–22]

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine
kinase receptor important to normal and pathogenic cellular
processes. Classic EGFR activation involves an EGFR ligand that
binds the extracellular domain of the receptor and induces
dimerization between two EGFR family molecules (reviewed in
ref. 1). Dimerization leads to a conformational change in the
intracellular domains of EGFR and allows for activation of the
kinase and autophosphorylation of the COOH-terminal tyrosines
(reviewed in ref. 1). Autophosphorylation permits the docking of
signaling proteins, which stimulate cellular processes such as cell
growth and survival. Breast cancer is one pathologic process where
EGFR has been found to be overexpressed. Specifically, >60 studies
have been performed using various methods of determining EGFR

expression with the range of overexpression from 20% to 70% in
breast cancer tissue compared with normal epithelial tissue (2–5).
The majority of these studies conclude that EGFR overexpression
correlates with poor prognosis in breast cancer (3–5). However, the
use of small molecule inhibitors and inhibitory antibodies has not
improved survival rates or decreased disease burden in breast
cancer patients (6, 7).
As with other targeted therapies, determining biomarkers for
sensitivity or resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) is
an important area of research. Mutations within the kinase domain
of EGFR in a subset of lung cancers have been shown to sensitize
tumors to EGFR TKIs (8, 9). In addition, a polymorphic variation in
intron 1 of EGFR is predictive for response to EGFR TKI treatment
in a study of pediatric solid tumors (10). Although relative protein
levels do not seem to be predictors of EGFR TKI response, several
studies suggest gene copy number as a predictor of response to
EGFR TKIs (11–14). Although amplification and mutation of EGFR
frequently occur in cancers of other origins, breast cancers have a
<10% rate of amplification and mutation of EGFR (15, 16).
Similar to EGFR, c-Src overexpression occurs in breast cancers
(17, 18). However, c-Src overexpression does not correlate with
poor prognosis (17, 18). An analysis of human breast tumors found
that 20% of breast cancers overexpress both EGFR and c-Src,
suggesting a cooperativity between the kinase activities of EGFR
and c-Src in breast cancer (17). In support of the ability of EGFR
and c-Src to functionally interact, studies overexpressing both
EGFR and c-Src in cell culture models showed synergistic increases
in DNA synthesis, transformation, and tumor growth in nude mice
(19, 20). The mechanism for this synergy is currently unknown.
However, when EGFR and c-Src are co-overexpressed, two
tyrosines in the intracellular domain of EGFR are phosphorylated:
Tyr845 and Y1101 (21). Mutating Tyr845 on the EGFR to an
unphosphorylatable phenylalanine (Y845F), and subsequent expression in fibroblasts and human breast cancer cells, leads to
abrogation of EGF-induced DNA synthesis (21, 22). Tyr845 on the
EGFR is a conserved tyrosine found within the kinase domains in
the majority of tyrosine kinases; however, unlike other tyrosine
kinases, Tyr845 is not required for kinase activity of EGFR (21).
These data suggest phosphorylation of Tyr845 may be important to
EGFR/c-Src biological synergy.
Here, we describe a pathway independent of EGFR kinase
activity where EGFR is tyrosine phosphorylated and growth is
maintained. We previously identified seven EGFR-expressing breast
cancer cell lines that grow in the presence of EGFR TKIs. Of these
seven, five cell lines maintained EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in
the presence of gefitinib. In this report, we describe how
maintenance of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in one such cell
line, SUM229, is mediated by the kinase activity of c-Src. The kinase
activity of c-Src also contributed to DNA synthesis and proliferation in the presence of EGFR TKI. In addition, we identified Met as
a highly phosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinase regulating c-Src

activity in the presence of gefitinib. Interestingly, treatment with a
Met TKI in the presence of gefitinib also decreased EGFR EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation and growth. Taken together, these data
suggest proliferation of EGFR-expressing breast cancer cells in the
presence of gefitinib was mediated, at least in part, by a Met/c-Src
signaling pathway via phosphorylation of EGFR.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Gefitinib was provided by AstraZeneca and PP2 and SU11274
were purchased from EMD Biosciences. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)
was purchased from Sigma. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma
or VWR unless indicated.
Cell lines and growth conditions. SUM149 and SUM229 cell lines were
a gift from Dr. Stephen Ethier (Wayne State University, Detroit, MI). The
cells were cultured in 5% IH medium (Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented
with 5% fetal bovine serum, 1 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 5 Ag/mL insulin,
2.5 Ag/mL amphotericin B, and 25 Ag/mL gentamicin) in 10% CO2.
Transfections. SUM 149 and SUM 229 cells were transfected using a 3:1
ratio of FuGENE6 (Roche) to DNA (pcDNA3-wt-c-Src or pcDNA3-K-c-Src;
gift from S. Parsons, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). For growth
assays, 6 AL FuGENE6 and 2 Ag DNA were added to the cells, and for
immunoblotting, 18 AL Fugene6 and 6 Ag DNA were added. The transfection
mixture was added to cells growing in normal growth medium. The cells
were then incubated with the mixture for 48 h.
Immunoblotting. Cells were plated at one million cells per 100-mm dish
and grown for 48 h. Cells were then lysed in CHAPs lysis buffer [10 mmol/L
CHAPs, 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mmol/L NaCl, and 2 mmol/L EDTA
with 10 Amol/L sodium orthovanadate and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail
(EMD Biosciences)]. For immunoblotting, 10 to 50 Ag of protein lysate were
separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon P (Millipore).
Membranes were blocked in either 5% nonfat dry milk or 5% bovine serum
albumin for 1 h at 25jC. The following primary antibodies were used in
the experiments: anti-EGFR, anti–pY845-EGFR, anti–pY992-EGFR, anti–
pY1045-EGFR, anti–pY1068-EGFR, anti–pY1148-EGFR, anti–pY1173-EGFR,
anti-Met, and anti–pY1234/1235-Met (Cell Signaling), anti-phosphotyrosine,
anti–pY1086-EGFR, and anti–pY416-Src [Py-Plus-horseradish peroxidase
(HRP); Invitrogen], and anti-Src (2–17; gift from S. Parsons). All antibodies
were incubated overnight at 4jC, except for the HRP-linked phosphotyrosine antibody (1 h at 25jC). Membranes were washed with TBS + 0.1%
Tween 20 thrice for 10 min, followed by incubation with corresponding
secondary antibody and another series of three washes. Incubation with
enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare) was followed by exposure to
film. Experiments were repeated at least thrice and quantitated using
densitometry (AlphaEaseFC; AlphaInnotech).
Immunoprecipitations. Cells were lysed as described above, and 500 Ag
of cell lysate was incubated with 5 AL of EGFR antibody (mab108; gift from
M. Weber, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA) and rocked for 1 h at
4jC. Forty microliters of protein A beads (Millipore) were added for 30 min
at 4jC rocking. The beads were washed thrice with CHAPs lysis buffer,
resuspended in 2 sample buffer, boiled, and loaded onto a 7.5% SDS-PAGE.
Proteins were transferred to Immobolin-P and immunoblotted using the
indicated antibodies described above.
In vitro kinase assays. For EGFR kinase assays, cells were washed in
PBS and lysed in solubilization buffer [50 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.5), 10%
glycerol, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 Ag/mL aprotinin, and 400 nmol/L sodium
orthovanadate]. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, quantitated, and
0.5 mg of protein was immunoprecipitated using EGFR antibodies (mab108;
gift from M. Weber). Antibody-bound proteins were collected using protein
A beads (Millipore) and washed thrice in HTG buffer [20 mmol/L HEPES
(pH 7.5), 0.1% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol]. For the kinase reaction,
40 AL HTG buffer, 4 AL MnCl2 (of 100-mmol/L stock), and 10 ACi 32P-gATP
(GE Healthcare) were incubated for 10 min at 30jC. The beads were
pelleted and the supernatant removed and discarded. Sample buffer was
added to the pellets; the samples were boiled, and proteins were separated

using 7.5% SDS-PAGE. The gels were dried and exposed to film. Experiments
were repeated at least thrice with densitometry used for quantitation.
Cell growth assays. The indicated breast cancer cells were plated in
triplicate in 6-well plates at 35,000 cells per well (day 0). The next day, the
cells were treated with indicated inhibitors every day for 7 d at the indicated
dosage. The number of cells was determined using a Beckman Coulter
Counter on days 1, 4, and 8. Experiments were repeated at least twice, and
the average and SE was graphed using a log10 scale for cell numbers.
BrdUrd incorporation assays. After transfection with the c-Src
constructs for 24 h, 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib was added for 20 h. One hundred
micromoles per liter of BrdUrd was added for 4 h before fixation of the cells
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 25jC. Cells were permeabilized
using 0.01% Triton X-100 for 3 min at 4jC and washed with PBS thrice. DNA
was then exposed by incubation of the cells with 2 mol/L HCl for 1 h at
37jC and neutralized with two borate buffer washes. Cells were then
blocked in 20% goat serum for 1 h at 25jC and incubated with alexa-fluor
594 anti-BrdUrd–conjugated antibody (Invitrogen; 1:50) for 1 h at 37jC.
Excess antibody was washed away, coverslips were mounted, and BrdUrdincorporated nuclei were counted as a ratio of the total number of cells.
One hundred cells per coverslip were counted with experiments performed
in duplicate.
Phospho-proteomic array. The Human Phospho-RTK Array kit was
purchased from R&D Systems. The membranes contain spotted antibodies
corresponding to 42 distinct receptor tyrosine kinases with nine species and
antibody controls. SUM149 and SUM229 cells were seeded at one million
cells on 100-mm plates and allowed to proliferate for 48 h. Cells were then
treated with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib for 30 min and lysed in the recommended
NP40 lysis buffer [1% NP40, 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 137 mmol/L
NaCl, 10% glycerol, 2 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
and 1 protease inhibitor cocktail]. The arrays were blocked in the
provided blocking buffer and incubated with 500 Ag of lysate overnight
at 4jC. The arrays were washed and incubated with a phosphotyrosine
detection antibody, treated with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham), and exposed to film.
Statistical analysis. To perform the statistical analyses in this report, the
Student’s t test was used using the statistical software in GraphPad Prism.
P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results
Growth and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence
of EGFR TKIs. Clinical studies have not shown an improvement
in survival of breast cancers treated with the EGFR TKI, gefitinib.
To determine a mechanism for EGFR TKI intrinsic resistance, we
identified seven breast cancer cell lines to be intrinsically resistant
to EGFR TKIs. In analyzing the responsiveness of the seven cell
lines to EGFR TKIs, we measured phosphorylation of EGFR as a
surrogate marker for EGFR kinase activity. Interestingly, five of
the seven EGFR TKI–resistant cell lines showed EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 1A). In addition,
four EGFR TKI–sensitive cell lines showed complete inhibition
of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib
(Fig. 1A). To ensure gefitinib was inhibiting EGFR kinase activity,
SUM149 and SUM229 cells were treated with increasing concentrations of gefitinib for 30 min, and in vitro kinase activity of the
EGFR was measured (Fig. 1B). We found that 0.1 Amol/L gefitinib
for 30 min was sufficient to inhibit the EGFR kinase activity in both
SUM149 and SUM229 cells (Fig. 1B). These results show a lack of
correlation between EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and the kinase
activity of EGFR in breast cancer cells.
To determine the specific sites of phosphorylation maintained in
the presence of gefitinib, SUM149 and SUM229 cells were treated
with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib for 30 min. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibodies and immunoblotted using the
indicated phospho-specific antibodies for tyrosines on EGFR.

Figure 1. EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
in the presence of EGFR TKIs. A, a panel
of breast cancer cell lines was plated at
1 million cells per 100-mm plate for 48 h.
Increasing doses of gefitinib were added
for 30 min before lysing of the cells.
Lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP )
with EGFR antibodies and immunoblotted
(IB ) with phosphotyrosine antibodies.
B, SUM149 and SUM229 cells were
cultured and treated as in A ; however,
the immunoprecipitates were subjected to
an in vitro kinase activity assay. EGFR
autophosphorylation was measured
by autoradiography after SDS-PAGE
separation. C, EGFR immunoprecipitates
from SUM149 and SUM229 cells were
immunoblotted with antibodies to the
specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites on
EGFR (Y845, Y992, Y1045, Y1068, Y1086,
Y1148, and Y1173) and EGFR itself.

Except for Tyr1148, all sites of tyrosine phosphorylation were still
detectable after gefitinib treatment in SUM229 cells, whereas only
Tyr992, Tyr1086, and Tyr1173 were detectable in SUM149 cells
(Fig. 1C). These data show that in SUM229 cells, multiple sites of
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation are maintained in the presence of
gefitinib.
C-Src kinase activity mediates EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of EGFR TKIs. One site of phosphorylation
maintained in SUM229 cells, but not in SUM149 cells treated with
gefitinib, was the c-Src phosphorylation site, Tyr845. To determine
the influence of c-Src kinase activity on EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation after gefitinib treatment, we transfected SUM149 cells with
wt-c-Src and SUM229 cells with a dominant-negative kinase-dead
c-Src (K-c-Src). The K-c-Src construct contains mutations in the
kinase domain that prevent ATP binding. After 48 h of incubation
with the constructs, the cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib
for 30 min and EGFR phosphorylation was measured using
immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. In SUM149 cells,
transfection with wt-c-Src increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 2A). Conversely, transfection
of K-c-Src into SUM229 cells decreased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 2A). To determine the sites
of phosphorylation modified with wt-c-Src or K-c-Src expression,
whole cell lysates were immunoblotted with phosphospecific
antibodies corresponding to EGFR tyrosines and with antibodies
against EGFR and c-Src (Fig. 2B). EGFR phosphorylation of Tyr845
and Tyr1086 were increased in SUM149 cells with expression of
wt-c-Src in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 2B). In SUM229 cells,
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation on Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1086 was
decreased with the expression of K-c-Src and treatment with
gefitinib (Fig. 2B). The phosphorylation of Tyr1045, Tyr1068, Tyr1148,
and Tyr1173 on EGFR was unaffected by transfection with either
wt-c-Src or K-c-Src (Fig. 2B). Taken together, these data implicate
c-Src in the phosphorylation of EGFR in the presence of gefitinib.

C-Src kinase activity mediates growth in the presence of
EGFR TKIs. Breast cancer cells that maintain EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in the presence of EGFR TKIs also continue to
proliferate in the presence of EGFR TKIs. Therefore, to determine if
c-Src kinase activity regulates proliferation in the presence of EGFR
TKIs, we examined BrdUrd incorporation after transfection of
c-Src constructs and cell counting with EGFR and c-Src small
molecule inhibitors. In SUM149 breast cancer cells, treatment with
0.5 Amol/L gefitinib decreased BrdUrd incorporation from 44% to
8% (Fig. 3A, open bars). SUM149 cell transfected with wt-c-Src
showed no increase in BrdUrd incorporation under normal growth
conditions (Fig. 3A, filled bars). However, in the gefitinib-treated
cells, the percent cells incorporating BrdUrd increased from 8%
to 19%, which was a statistical increase in BrdUrd incorporation
(P = 0.009; Fig. 3A). In SUM229 breast cancer cells, treatment with
0.5 Amol/L gefitinib did not significantly change the BrdUrd
incorporation compared with untreated cells (44% versus 38%;
Fig. 3A, open bars). However, transfection with K-c-Src decreased
BrdUrd incorporation in untreated SUM229 cells, from 44% to 34%,
with a P value approaching significance at 0.05 (Fig. 3A).
Importantly, in gefitinib-treated cells, BrdUrd incorporation
significantly decreased from 38% to 18% with transfection of
K-c-Src (P = 0.011; Fig. 3A). Taken together, these data suggest the
kinase activity of c-Src modulates the response of breast cancer
cells to gefitinib.
To determine if the reduction in DNA synthesis observed in the
BrdUrd experiments reflected a decrease in proliferation, SUM149
and SUM229 cells were treated with the combination of gefitinib
and the c-Src inhibitor PP2. Inhibiting EGFR kinase activity with
0.1 Amol/L gefitinib in SUM149 cells completely inhibited
proliferation, whereas in SUM229 cells, proliferation continued to
occur with gefitinib treatment (Fig. 3B, circles). Treatment of
SUM149 and SUM229 cells with 1 Amol/L PP2 decreased c-Src
activity as measured by the phosphorylation of Src substrates (data

not shown) and slightly decreased proliferation (Fig. 3B, triangles).
The combination of 0.1 Amol/L gefitinib and 1 Amol/L PP2 further
decreased proliferation in SUM149 and inhibited proliferation in
SUM229 cells (Fig. 3B, diamonds). These data are consistent with a
role for the kinase activity of c-Src in the proliferation of SUM229
cells in the presence of EGFR TKIs.
Met is highly phosphorylated in the presence of EGFR TKIs.
The regulation of c-Src activity occurs through multiple mechanisms, including the phosphorylation of Tyr527 (inactivating) and
Tyr416 (activating; ref. 23). Receptor tyrosine kinases, including
EGFR family members, activate c-Src. In our model, we inhibited
EGFR kinase activity; therefore, in SUM229 cells, activation of c-Src
may require another kinase. To identify additional receptor tyrosine
kinases activated in SUM229 cells, we used a phospho-proteomic
array spotted with antibodies for 42 receptor tyrosine kinases.
SUM149 or SUM229 cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib for
30 minutes and lysates were collected and incubated with arrays.
We found the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated receptors in
SUM149 cells compared with SUM229 to be distinct (Fig. 4A).
SUM229 cells had high levels of Met phosphorylation both in the
untreated and the gefitinib-treated conditions, whereas SUM149
cells had undetectable levels of Met tyrosine phosphorylation
(Fig. 4A). Increased Met tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed
using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting, where the phosphorylation of Met was 5-fold higher in SUM229 cells compared
with the Met phosphorylation levels in SUM149 cells (Fig. 4B).
These data show that Met was highly tyrosine phosphorylated in
the presence of EGFR TKIs in SUM229 cells.
Met kinase activity stimulates c-Src phosphorylation and
activation. To determine if Met is the kinase that phosphorylates
and activates c-Src in the presence of EGFR TKIs in SUM229 cells,

we treated cells with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib, 1.0 Amol/L SU11274
(a Met inhibitor), or the combination of gefitinib and SU11274 for
30 minutes. Lysates were isolated, separated by SDS-PAGE, and
immunoblotted using pY845-EGFR or pY416-Src antibodies. As
mentioned above, Tyr845 on EGFR is a substrate for c-Src kinase
activity. SUM229 cells treated with gefitinib (E) showed a decrease
but not a complete inhibition of Tyr845 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C).
The Met inhibitor (M) also showed a decrease in EGFR Tyr845
phosphorylation, and the combination of EGFR and Met inhibitors
(E+M) completely abrogated Tyr845 phosphorylation (Fig. 4C, top).
The inhibition of Met decreased the phosphorylation of Tyr416, an
autophosphorylation site often used to represent kinase activity of
c-Src (ref. 23; Fig. 4C, M). Taken together, these data suggest that
Met kinase activity mediated c-Src phosphorylation and activation
in SUM229 cells.
Met kinase activity mediates EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
in the presence of EGFR TKIs. We then tested whether inhibiting
Met activation would result in a similar decrease in EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in the presence of EGFR TKIs. SUM149 and
SUM229 cells were treated with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib (E), 1.0 Amol/L
SU11274 (M), or the combination (E+M) for 30 minutes. In SUM149
cells, as previously shown, gefitinib completely inhibited EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation. Conversely, in SUM229 cells, EGFR
remained phosphorylated in the presence of gefitinib (pEGFR;
Fig. 5A). The Met inhibitor alone had no effect on EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in SUM149 or SUM229 cells. However, the
combination of gefitinib and SU11274 (E+M) reduced EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation in SUM229 cells (pEGFR; Fig. 5A). Therefore,
similar to our observation with inhibition of c-Src kinase activity,
abrogating Met kinase activity in the presence of EGFR TKIs
decreased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in SUM229 cells.

Figure 2. c-Src kinase activity mediating EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation. A, SUM149 breast cancer
cells were transiently transfected with pcDNA-c-Src,
and SUM229 breast cancer cells were transiently

were treated with 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib for 30 min,
lysed and immunoprecipitated with EGFR antibodies,
and immunoblotted with phosphotyrosine antibodies
(top ). In addition, whole cell lysates were analyzed
for c-Src expression as a determination of
transfection of the c-Src constructs (bottom ).
B, SUM149 and SUM229 were transfected with
either c-Src or K-c-Src and treated with gefitinib
as described above. Whole cell lysates were
collected and immunoblotted using site-specific
phosphorylation antibodies on EGFR as well
as EGFR and c-Src.

We used phospho-specific antibodies to determine the specific

site–specific phosphorylation (Fig. 5B). These data suggest that

also signals to regulate cell growth, 8-day growth assays were
performed as described above. SUM229 cells were treated with 0.5
Amol/L gefitinib every day for 8 days, and we observed a decrease
in cell growth but not complete inhibition (Fig. 5C, circles).
Treatment with 1 Amol/L SU11274 (triangles) had no effect on the
growth of SUM229 cells; however, cotreatment with gefitinib and
SU11274 inhibited proliferation (Fig. 5C, diamonds). These data
imply, similar to c-Src, that inhibiting Met synergistically decreased
proliferation in the presence of EGFR TKIs.
Stimulating Met activation with HGF increases EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of EGFR TKIs. We
have shown that inhibiting Met decreased EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation and growth in SUM229 cells in the presence of
EGFR TKIs. To determine if the high level of Met tyrosine
phosphorylation observed in SUM229 cells was sufficient to induce
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and growth in the presence of
EGFR TKIs, SUM149 cells were stimulated with the Met growth
factor HGF. Increasing concentrations of HGF enhanced the
phosphorylation of Met in SUM149 cell line (Fig. 6A). These data
show that Met was capable of being tyrosine phosphorylated in
SUM149 cell line. Next, to determine if HGF treatment stimulated
EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of EGFR TKIs,
SUM149 cells were treated with 50 ng/mL HGF, 0.5 Amol/L
gefitinib, or the combination for 30 minutes. Treatment with HGF
did not alter EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in SUM149 cells, yet in
the presence of gefitinib, HGF stimulated a small amount of EGFR
phosphorylation (pEGFR; Fig. 6B).
Stimulating Met activation with HGF mediates proliferation
in the presence of EGFR TKIs. To determine if the stimulation
of Met phosphorylation was capable of inducing proliferation
in the presence of EGFR TKIs, SUM149 cells were cultured with
10 ng/mL HGF in the presence or absence of 0.5 Amol/L gefitinib.

Culturing SUM149 cells with 10 ng/mL HGF (diamonds) maintained proliferation at similar levels as normal growth medium
(Fig. 6C, diamonds). As previously described, treating cells with
0.5 Amol/L gefitinib completely inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 6C,
triangles). SUM149 cells cultured in HGF increased cell proliferation in the presence of gefitinib (Fig. 6C, circles). These
data suggest that the stimulation of Met tyrosine phosphorylation
via HGF treatment induced proliferation in the presence of EGFR
TKIs.

Discussion
In this report, we have shown that in SUM229 breast cancer
cells, EGFR was tyrosine phosphorylated and cells proliferated in
the presence of gefitinib via a Met/c-Src–mediated signaling
pathway. Specifically, we have shown preservation of EGFR
phosphorylation to be mediated by the kinase activity of c-Src,
on EGFR Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1086. Inhibiting c-Src kinase activity
reduced proliferation in the presence of gefitinib. Interestingly,
proliferation and EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence
of gefitinib occurred when c-Src was overexpressed SUM149 cells.
We found the kinase activity of c-Src was in part regulated by
constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of Met in SUM229 cells.
Abrogating Met and EGFR kinase activity inhibited phosphorylation on EGFR Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1173. We also found Met
kinase activity to be important for proliferation in the presence of
gefitinib. Stimulating SUM149 cells with HGF to induce Met
tyrosine phosphorylation increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and growth in the presence of EGFR TKIs. Taken together,
these data suggest that EGFR signaling and growth in the
presence of gefitinib is at least, in part, mediated by a Met/c-Src
pathway.

Our observation that EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation can occur
in the absence of intrinsic EGFR tyrosine kinase activity has been
made by others using different model systems. Specifically, mass
spectrometry analysis of EGFR after treatment with the small
molecule inhibitor AG1478 shows that Tyr992 and Tyr1068 remain
phosphorylated even in the presence of inhibitor (24). Others
confirmed these observations using immunoblotting techniques
with additional EGFR inhibitors (25, 26). Our data suggest that
EGFR may still be able to stimulate growth and survival in the
presence of EGFR TKIs. In addition, these data suggest measuring
tyrosine phosphorylation, particularly phosphorylation at specific
tyrosine sites, is not a good predictor of EGFR kinase activity.
Specifically, we found that EGFR remains tyrosine phosphorylated
when kinase activity was abrogated with a small molecule
inhibitor. In addition, we showed the phosphorylation level of
EGFR at specific tyrosines varies not only between cell lines but
also in responsiveness to EGFR TKIs. Therefore, these data suggest

phosphorylation and cell growth in the presence of EGFR TKIs. A, SUM149
cells were stimulated with increasing concentrations of HGF for 10 min. Lysates

careful selection of tyrosine sites analyzed for phosphorylation and
in vitro kinase assays to be used measure kinase activity of EGFR in
breast cancer cells.
Receptor tyrosine kinases have the ability to directly phosphorylate and/or associate with EGFR. Specifically, Tyr845, Tyr992,
Tyr1068, and Tyr1101 on EGFR are phosphorylated by c-Src and
HER2 (27–29). Phospho-proteomic technology and phosphosite–specific antibodies have improved the ability to detect small
changes in specific sites of tyrosine phosphorylation (26, 30, 31).
The data presented here confirm the kinase activity of c-Src is at
least partly responsible for EGFR phosphorylation on Tyr845, Tyr992,
and Tyr1086 in the presence of EGFR TKIs. In addition, in the
SUM229 cells, both K-c-Src and a c-Src small molecule inhibitor
reduced DNA synthesis and proliferation in the presence of EGFR
TKIs. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylation at
Tyr845, Tyr992, and Tyr1086 on the EGFR transduce signals to cell
proliferation in the presence of EGFR TKIs. Therefore, treating
EGFR-expressing breast cancers with a c-Src inhibitor in combination with EGFR inhibitor may decrease EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent signaling pathways and inhibit cell
growth.
Multiple lines of evidence support a physical and functional
interaction between Met and c-Src. A member of the Src kinase
family, Fyn, was first shown to associate with Met 15 years ago (32).
Because then, other c-Src family members, including c-Src, have
been found to associate with Met (33). The association between
Met and c-Src has functional significance, as c-Src kinase activity
is required for HGF-mediated motility and transformation in
mammary carcinoma cells and papillary renal carcinoma cells
(34, 35). In this report, we show Met kinase activity regulated c-Src
phosphorylation and activation. However, c-Src kinase activity was
not completely abrogated by Met inhibition in SUM229 cells,
suggesting an alternate mechanism for c-Src activation and/or
modification of dephosphorylation and turnover mechanisms of
c-Src. In that regard, others showed an incomplete inhibition of
c-Src phosphorylation of Tyr416 with c-Src inhibitor treatment and
implicated the inactivation of a tyrosine phosphatase (36). This
phenomenon will need to be further evaluated in SUM229 cells.
Transphosphorylation of EGFR by other receptor tyrosine
kinases has been well-documented (37). Examples of receptor
tyrosine kinases transphosphorylating the EGFR include HER2,
HER4, Met, and insulin-like growth factor I–IR (38–40). It has been
hypothesized that transphosphorylation occurs from direct interaction of the other receptor tyrosine kinases with EGFR. Recently,
Met tyrosine phosphorylation has been associated with acquired
EGFR TKI resistance in lung cancer cell lines containing EGFR
tyrosine kinase domain mutations (38). In the lung cancer model,
Met amplification is responsible for the high levels of Met tyrosine
phosphorylation (38). Met has also been shown to be physically
associated with EGFR, and this association mediates transphosphorylation of EGFR (41). In addition, Met is a tyrosine kinase
implicated in breast cancer progression (42–46). Specifically,
HGF/Met signaling pathways have been shown to increase tumor
vasculature volume, promote local and distant invasion of tumor
cells, and increase tumor growth and survival in mouse models
(42, 47, 48). In human breast tumor samples, an average of 30% of
samples express high levels of Met and 66% of samples express high
levels of HGF in the primary tumor and/or the associated lymph
node metastasis (44). Here, our data show that high levels of Met
tyrosine phosphorylation mediated c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation
and activation, resulting in the regulation of EGFR tyrosine

phosphorylation and growth in the presence of EGFR TKIs. In
combination with the c-Src data, these results suggest that the
mediation of EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation by Met may occur
through c-Src and not via a direct interaction with EGFR. However,
inhibiting Met kinase activity decreased phosphorylation on Tyr1068
and Tyr1173, whereas inhibiting c-Src kinase activity did not. These
data imply that Met is either directly phosphorylating Tyr1068 and
Tyr1173 on EGFR or is activating yet another tyrosine kinase.
Interestingly, although there are differences in the sites of tyrosine
phosphorylation regulated by Met and c-Src, the inhibition of
either kinase had similar effects on cell growth, suggesting a lack
of redundancy in the pathways activated through specific sites of
phosphorylation on EGFR.
Stimulation of Met with HGF in SUM149 cells increased EGFR
tyrosine phosphorylation and proliferation in the presence of
EGFR TKIs. However, the phospho-specific sites of EGFR tyrosine
phosphorylation were not altered in the presence of HGF (data not
shown). Therefore, complimentary to the wt-c-Src overexpression
in SUM149 cells, HGF increased EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation
and growth in the presence of EGFR TKIs, but neither c-Src

overexpression nor HGF stimulation seem to be sufficient to
replicate EGFR kinase independence of SUM229 cells. These data
suggest the requirement of other genetic and signaling alterations
in SUM229 cells to mediate EGFR tyrosine phosphorylation and
proliferation in the presence of EGFR TKIs.
In this study, we have implicated a Met/c-Src signaling pathway
to mediate proliferation in the presence of EGFR TKIs in breast
cancer cells. These data suggest inhibiting multiple tyrosine
kinases, including Met and c-Src in breast cancer cells, may be
an effective mechanism of inhibiting cell growth.
