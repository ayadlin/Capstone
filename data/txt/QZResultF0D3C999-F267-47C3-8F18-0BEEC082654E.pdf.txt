Non-canonical NFκB mutations reinforce pro-survival TNF
response in multiple myeloma through an autoregulatory
RelB:p50 NFκB pathway
P Roy, T Mukherjee, B Chatterjee1, B Vijayaragavan2, B Banoth and S Basak
Environmental drug resistance constitutes a serious impediment for therapeutic intervention in multiple myeloma. Tumorpromoting cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), induce nuclear factor-κB (NFκB)- driven expression of pro-survival factors,
which confer resistance in myeloma cells to apoptotic insults from TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and other
chemotherapeutic drugs. It is thought that RelA:p50 dimer, activated from IκBα-inhibited complex in response to TNF-induced
canonical NFκB signal, mediates the pro-survival NFκB function in cancerous cells. Myeloma cells additionally acquire gain-offunction mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module, which induces partial proteolysis of p100 into p52 to promote RelB:p52/
NFκB activation from p100-inhibited complex during immune cell differentiation. However, role of non-canonical NFκB signaling in
the drug resistance in multiple myeloma remains unclear. Here we report that myeloma-associated non-canonical aberrations
reinforce pro-survival TNF signaling in producing a protracted TRAIL-refractory state. These mutations did not act through a typical
p52 NFκB complex, but completely degraded p100 to reposition RelB under IκBα control, whose degradation during TNF signaling
induced an early RelB:p50 containing NFκB activity. More so, autoregulatory RelB synthesis prolonged this TNF-induced RelB:p50
activity in myeloma cells harboring non-canonical mutations. Intriguingly, TNF-activated RelB:p50 dimer was both necessary and
sufﬁcient, and RelA was not required, for NFκB-dependent pro-survival gene expressions and suppression of apoptosis. Indeed,
high RelB mRNA expressions in myeloma patients correlated with the augmented level of pro-survival factors and resistance to
therapeutic intervention. In sum, we provide evidence that cancer-associated mutations perpetuate TNF-induced pro-survival NFκB
activity through autoregulatory RelB control and thereby exacerbate environmental drug resistance in multiple myeloma.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma, an incurable plasma cell malignancy, accounts
for ~ 13% of all hematological cancers.1 Disease progression
involves clonal expansion of transformed plasma cells into tumors
in the bone marrow. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) and other chemotherapeutic drugs induce Caspase-8
dependent apoptosis in various cancerous cells with negligible
toxicity for healthy cells.2 Preclinical studies accordingly advocated
for TRAIL-based interventions in multiple myeloma.3–5 However,
subsequent clinical trials revealed a rather moderate beneﬁt with
only a small subset of patients responding satisfactorily to
TRAIL.2,6 Indeed, certain patient-derived myeloma cells were
found to be resistant to drug-induced apoptosis owing to
increased level of cFLIP and other pro-survival factors, which
counteract caspase activation.4 As drug resistance constitutes a
serious impediment for myeloma therapy, it is important to
understand fully the underlying molecular mechanisms.
In myeloma cells, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) induces expression of the pro-survival factors, which are known to confer
resistance to apoptotic insults, including TRAIL.7–9 Bone marrow
stromal cells provide paracrine TNF signals in myeloma.10 Serum
level of TNF was correlated with disease severity in multiple

myeloma,11,12 and provided for a predictive indicator of high
symptom burden for patients undergoing maintenance therapy.13
Clinical trials also demonstrated that thalidomide analogs, which
inhibit TNF production in the tumor microenvironment, enhance
overall response in TRAIL-based therapy.14,15 These studies
implicated TNF in environmental-mediated drug resistance in
multiple myeloma.
At the molecular level, TNF engages NEMO (nuclear factor-κB
(NFκB_ essential modulator)-IKK2 (IκB kinase subunit 2, also
known as IKKβ) kinase complex, which promotes phosphorylation
and degradation of inhibitory IκBα (inhibitor of NF-κBα), thereby,
liberating RelA:p50 dimer into the nucleus via the canonical NFκB
pathway.16 In a negative feedback loop, RelA:p50 transcriptionally
induces synthesis of IκBα, which ensures post-induction attenuation of RelA:p50/NFκB activity. TNF stimulates transcription of prosurvival factors from their cognate κB-driven promoters. It is
commonly believed that RelA:p50 mediates this pro-survival NFκB
function in myeloma cells.7 Importantly, IKK inhibitors were shown
to sensitize myeloma cells to apoptotic death.17,18
In addition, a distinct non-canonical NFκB pathway is activated
by cell-differentiating cues in physiological settings.19 In resting
cells, cIAP1/cIAP2 and TRAF3-dependent ubiquitination promotes
degradation of NIK (NFκB inducing kinase). Induction of the non-

canonical pathway rescues NIK from constitutive degradation
resulting in activation of IKK1 (IκB kinase subunit 1, also known as
IKKα). IKK1 phosphorylates Nfkb2-encoded precursor p100, which
retains RelB in the cytoplasmic complex in unstimulated cells.
Subsequent partial proteolysis or processing of p100 removes the
C-terminal inhibitory domain to generate mature p52 subunit,
thereby liberating RelB:p52/NFκB activity into the nucleus.
Myeloma cells acquire gain-of-function mutations in this
non-canonical NFκB pathway with separate studies reporting
~ 10–15% multiple myeloma patients harbor such genetic
aberrations.18,20,21 Myeloma-associated mutations either inactivate
negative regulators of NIK, such as cIAP1/cIAP2 and TRAF3, or
augment expression of upstream inducers of the pathway,
including CD40, LTβR as well as NIK itself.18,22,23 Moreover,
mutations in Nfkb2 that produce dysfunctional p100 lacking the
NFκB inhibitory domain has been reported.24 It was proposed that
NIK activates the canonical IKK2-RelA pathway in a subset of
human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs) to promote cell survival.18,22,25
However, a role of NIK-induced non-canonical RelB/NFκB activity
in imparting drug resistance in multiple myeloma has not been
explored.
The RelB/NFκB-mediated gene expressions is thought to have
limited physiological functions in immune cell differentiation.19
Interestingly, a low level of NIK-independent, constitutive RelB:
p52/NFκB activity has been identiﬁed in myeloma cells.26
Surprisingly, constitutive RelB:p52 activity was shown both to
promote and suppress NFκB-dependent gene expressions in
HMCLs and patient-derived myeloma cells.26,27 As NFκB target
genes encode important pro-survival factors, we asked if
mutational activation of the non-canonical RelB/NFκB pathway
modulates TNF response, and thereby modiﬁes resistance of
myeloma cells to apoptotic insults.
Here, we demonstrate that non-canonical NFκB mutations
collaborate with TNF signaling in producing a protracted TRAILrefractory state in myeloma cells. In an interdisciplinary approach,
we identify that depletion of p100, owing aberrations in the noncanonical module, triggers an autoregulatory RelB pathway, which
perpetuates an alternate RelB:p50 NF-κB activity in response to
TNF. Intriguingly, pro-survival TNF response is attributed to RelB:
p50, and not RelA:p50, NFκB activity in myeloma cells harboring
non-canonical mutations. Finally, our database analyses indicate a
possible role of autoregulatory RelB/NFκB pathway in resistance of
myeloma patients from therapeutic intervention. In sum, we
provide evidence that cancer-associated mutations perpetuate
TNF-induced pro-survival NFκB response through autoregulatory
RelB control and thereby exacerbate environmental drug resistance in multiple myeloma.
RESULTS
Non-canonical NFκB mutations collaborate with TNF in
exacerbating resistance of myeloma cells to apoptotic insults
Given prevalence of mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module
in multiple myeloma, we examined if these mutations alter
resistance of cancerous cells to apoptotic TRAIL. We analyzed
HMCLs with mutations in the non-canonical pathway; KMS28PE as
well as KMS20 harbor genetic aberration in locus encoding cIAPs,
OciMy1 bears homozygous deletion of Traf3, and JK6L contains an
inactivating mutation in Nfkb2/p100.18,22,28 As a control, we used
OciMy5 cells that lack non-canonical mutations but bear an
ampliﬁcation of Nfkb1. However, cell treatment using 100 ng/ml of
TRAIL led to similar ~ 45-55% cell death at 12 h post-treatment in
these HMCLs irrespective of mutations in non-canonical module
(Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S1a). TNF treatment alone
had no discernible effect on cell viability (Figure 1a). It has been
suggested that TNF instill a refractory state in myeloma cells
present in the bone marrow that then become resistant to TRAIL
Oncogene (2017) 1417 – 1429

and other chemotherapeutic agents.8,9 To capture this pathological role of TNF, we primed myeloma cells with TNF and
subsequently exposed them to TRAIL at 8 h post-TNF treatment.
Interestingly, TNF priming resulted in ~ 50% protection from
TRAIL-mediated cell death speciﬁcally in HMCLs harboring noncanonical mutations, such as KMS28PE, JK6L, KMS20 and OciMy1,
with only marginal effect in control OciMy5 cells (Figure 1b). Our
ﬂuorescence-activated cell sorting analyses revealed early apoptotic death in 32% KMS28PE and 33.3% JK6L cells within 4 h of
TRAIL treatment (Figure 1c and Supplementary Figure S1b) and
also consistently demonstrated that TNF priming led to more than
40% reduction in TRAIL-induced apoptotic cell death in KMS28PE
as well as JK6L cells (Figure 1c). These results indicated that
activating mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module might not
act independently, but collaborate with TNF in exacerbating
resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs in multiple myeloma.
Perpetuating RelB:p50/NFκB activity confers TRAIL resistance in
TNF-primed HMCLs harboring non-canonical mutations
Because TNF-induced pro-survival mechanisms are thought to
involve the canonical NFκB pathway, we tested whether these
non-canonical mutations strengthen TNF-activated RelA/NFκB
response. Our electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and
supershift analyses revealed that TNF induced comparable nuclear
RelA NFκB DNA-binding activity, which was similarly attenuated
by 8 h in OciMy5, KMS28PE, JK6L and OciMy1 cell lines regardless
of non-canonical mutations (Figures 2a and b). TNF signal led to
very weak, if any, RelA NFκB activation in KMS20 cells. Curiously,
TNF activated an additional RelB:p50 containing NFκB dimer in
HMCLs with non-canonical mutations, but not in control OciMy5
cell line. Unlike diminishing RelA:p50 activity, RelB:p50 dimer
progressively accumulated in the nucleus of these cells producing
robust κB DNA-binding activity at 8 h post-stimulation (Figures 2a
and b). Induction of canonical NFκB signaling using PMA/
Ionomycin also induced prolonged RelB:p50 response in JK6L
cells (Supplementary Figure S2a). Prior studies have suggested
that p100, instead of being partially proteolysed into p52,
undergoes complete degradation in myeloma-derived cells in
the presence of chronic non-canonical signal.29,30 As RelB:p52
constituted only a minor NFκB DNA-binding activity in KMS28PE
and JK6L cells (Figure 2b), we examined whether activating
mutations in the non-canonical module led to degradation of
p100. Our immunoblot analyses revealed a severe reduction
in p100 levels in KMS28PE, KMS20 and OciMy1 cells, as opposed
to control OciMy5 cell line (Figure 2c). Consistent to earlier
observation on p100 degradation,29 we were unable to detect p52
accumulation concomitant to p100 depletion in HMCLs possessing non-canonical mutations. Likewise, JK6L expressed an
unstable form of truncated p100 only at a reduced level without
p52 accumulation. However, NFκB2 mRNA levels were comparable
in these HMCLs (Supplementary Figure S2b). We also observed
signiﬁcantly a reduced level of RelA protein in KMS20 cells
(Figure 2c), which likely have contributed to the diminished
RelA/NFκB activity in these cells.
Next, we investigated role of individual NFκB dimers in HMCLs
bearing distorted non-canonical module. We found that shRNAmediated knockdown of RelA expression does not impact TRAIL
resistance of TNF-primed KMS28PE cells in our cell-death assay
(Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure S2c). Intact TRAIL resistance
of KMS28PE cells subjected to knockdown of NFκB2 mRNA
suggested that p52 is dispensable for the protective effect of TNF
(Figure 2d and Supplementary Figure S2d). Remarkably, shRNA
depletion identiﬁed that RelB is critical for the resilience of TNFprimed KMS28PE cells to subsequent TRAIL treatment (Figure 2d
and Supplementary Figure S2e). Our data indicated that
prolonged RelB/NFκB activity induced by TNF is responsible for
the protracted drug-refractory state of HMCLs harboring non-

canonical aberrations, and that this resistance is independent of
RelA. These studies also raised a mechanistic conundrum as
activating mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module do not
appear to act through RelB:p52; rather they promote perpetuating
RelB:p50/NFκB response to canonical TNF signal.
A lack of p100 promotes RelB:p50/NFκB activation upon TNF
stimulation
How do aberrations in the non-canonical module instruct altered
NFκB dimer usage during canonical signaling? In resting cells, RelB
is thought to be sequestered in RelB:p100 complex, which is

insensitive to canonical signals. In specialized cell types, however,
RelB:p50 dimer was shown to bind to IκBα and translocate into
the nucleus upon IκBα degradation.31 To further understand
RelB/NFκB control in inﬂammatory settings, we rewired p100- and
IκBα-mediated regulations in a mathematical model, termed the
NFκB Systems Model v2.0 (see Supplementary Appendix for a
detailed description). Our computational simulations suggested
that a small fraction of RelB is sequestered by IκBα in unstimulated WT cells, and that abundance of RelB–IκBα complex is
increased by threefold in the p100-deﬁcient system (Figure 3a).
We tested these predictions using genetically deﬁned mouse

complexes using speciﬁc antibodies indicated that the slower migrating complex on EMSA gel is composed of RelA and the faster migrating
complex is composed of RelB. Combining αp50 or αp52 antibody with αRelA antibody, composition of the residual RelB NFκB DNA-binding
activity was determined. (c) Immunoblot charting cellular levels of p52/p100, RelB and RelA in a panel of HMCLs. * indicates a truncated p100

embryonic ﬁbroblasts (MEFs). Our immunoprecipitation analyses
demonstrated that RelB associates with p100 as well as p50, and
also binds to IκBα in WT cells. Moreover, abundance of RelB–IκBα
complex was augmented in Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 3b). RelB also
bound to IκBɛ in the absence of p100 (Supplementary Figure S3a).
We concluded that the absence of p100 facilitates complex
formation between RelB and classical IκBs, which respond to
canonical NF-κB signal.
Consistently, elevated level of latent RelB–IκB complex promoted induction of nuclear RelB:p50/NFκB activity within 30 min
of TNF stimulation in Nfkb2−/− MEFs with only minor RelB:p50
induction in WT cells (Figures 3c and d and Supplementary
Figure S3b). Although this early RelB:p50 activity was attenuated
by 1 h, TNF additionally stimulated a late RelB:p50 NFκB DNAbinding activity, which gradually accumulated in the nucleus
between 2 and 8 h in Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 3c). Defective
attenuation of early RelB:p50 activity at 1 h in IκBα-deﬁcient MEFs
(Figure 3e) suggested that IκBα negative feedback regulates the
duration of early RelB:p50 response, analogous to RelA:p50
control. Absence of IκBα feedback, however, did not promote
RelB:p50 activity at 8 h in IκBα-deﬁcient MEFs (Figure 3e)
indicating that additional mechanisms potentiate this late activity.
Although our computational simulation faithfully reproduced
early RelB:p50 induction, it failed to capture progressive nuclear
Oncogene (2017) 1417 – 1429

accumulation of late-acting RelB:p50 dimer observed in TNFstimulated Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 3f). It was shown that RelA:p50
induces the expression of RelB mRNA from the κB-driven
promoter (Supplementary Figures S3c and S4a).32 We hypothesized that RelA-driven RelB synthesis promotes this late RelB:p50
activity. TNF stimulation of Relb−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs expressing
RelB from either a constitutive or a κB-driven retroviral promoter
(Supplementary Figure S3d) conﬁrmed that κB-dependent
expression of RelB is necessary for late, but not early, RelB:p50
induction in the absence of p100 (Figure 3g). Our immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that p100 sequesters RelB to curtail
this late-acting RelB:p50 response in WT cells (Supplementary
Figure S3e).33 Even so, implementation of RelA-driven RelB
synthesis in our mathematical model was insufﬁcient for
recapitulating late RelB:p50 activity in Nfkb2−/− cells (Figure 3f).
Our analyses revealed that a lack of p100 not only provokes
early RelB:p50 activity, but also unleashed a robust late-acting
RelB:p50 response to TNF. This persistent RelB:p50 response in
Nfkb2−/− cells mirrored the prolonged RelB:p50 activity observed
in HMCLs devoid of p100. However, our biochemical and
computational studies suggested that well-documented mechanisms, those include IκBα mediated regulations and RelA-induced
synthesis control, are inadequate to account for the prolonged
RelB:p50/NFκB response during canonical TNF signaling.

An autoregulatory circuit prolongs RelB:p50/NFκB activity upon

Although κB sites in the Relb promoter were necessary, RelAdriven synthesis of RelB was not sufﬁcient for prolonged
RelB:p50/NFκB response to TNF in p100-depleted cell systems

(Figures 3f and g). We examined if the RelB:p50 dimer per se
mediates RelB synthesis in perpetuating RelB:p50/NFκB activity.
Our in vitro DNA-binding analyses revealed that RelA:p50 and RelB:
p50 both bind to the conserved κB sites present in Relb promoter
with comparable efﬁciencies (Supplementary Figures S4b and c).

three independent biological replicates, revealing recruitment of RelA (left) and RelB (right) NFκB dimers to Relb promoter in a TNF time course
in Nfkb2−/− MEFs. Fold enrichment of Relb promoter DNA in RelA or RelB immunopellet relative to control IgG was determined using
quantitative PCR. Binding to Gapdh promoter served as a negative control. (b) Computational simulation recapitulating progressive nuclear

was quantiﬁed and expressed as a mean of four biological replicates ± s.e.m. (d) ChIP analyses demonstrating TNF-induced recruitment of RelB

transcriptase–PCR revealing the relative level of RelB mRNA in a TNF time course in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs. The data represent three biological
replicates. (f) A graphical depiction of the proposed signaling circuitry underlying inﬂammatory RelB control. RelB either assembles into
IκBsome with preferred binding partner p100 or binds to IκBα as the RelB:p50 dimer. TNF signal targets IκB-inhibited complex to transiently
activate RelB:p50. In addition to RelA-induced synthesis, a dominant autoregulatory loop, denoted with green line, prolongs RelB:p50
response to TNF in the absence of p100. Magenta and green block arrows signify targeting of IκBα and p100 by canonical and non-canonical
signals, respectively.

Using ChIP assay, we could demonstrate that RelA is recruited to
Relb promoter within 30 min of TNF stimulation and then
gradually removed (Figure 4a and Supplementary Figure S4d).
While early chromatin recruitment was subtle, RelB robustly
occupied the Relb promoter in Nfkb2−/− MEFs at 8 h post-TNF
stimulation, corroborating the heightened late RelB DNA-binding
activity observed in these cells.
Rewiring this autoregulatory control in our mathematical model,
we could efﬁciently recapitulate progressive nuclear accumulation
of the RelB:p50 dimer in Nfkb2−/− MEFs in response to TNF
(Figure 4b). Computational simulations further predicted intact
late RelB:p50 response in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs owing to autoregulatory control. Our EMSA conﬁrmed gradual nuclear

accumulation with strong RelB:p50 activity at 8 h post-TNF
stimulation in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 4c) and ChIP analyses
revealed recruitment of RelB to Relb promoter at this time point
(Figure 4d and Supplementary Figure S4e). Finally, despite the
absence of RelA, TNF-stimulated RelB mRNA synthesis in
Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 4e) that temporally coincided with
TNF-induced RelB:p50 DNA-binding activity. Collectively, our study
identiﬁed a novel positive autoregulatory loop, which perpetuates
RelB:p50/NFκB activity during canonical TNF signaling (Figure 4f).
Such autoregulatory RelB control generated NFκB DNA-binding
activity despite inactivation of RelA. Our MEF-based analyses
suggested that this autoregulatory loop is hardwired within the
NFκB circuit and is triggered upon p100 depletion. We postulated

that prolonged RelB:p50 containing NFκB response to TNF in p100depleted HMCLs could be a consequence of autoregulatory control.

To this end, we compared global gene expressions (see Materials
and methods) in TNF-treated MEFs of the following genotypes,
namely WT ﬁbroblasts, which primarily elicits RelA:p50 activity,
Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− cells, which exclusively activate RelB:p50, and
control NFκB-deﬁcient Rela−/−Relb−/−Rel−/− cells, which lack the
expression of all three transcription-activating NFκB subunits RelA,
RelB and cRel. Applying the k-median algorithm to our genome-scale
data, we clustered genes induced in WT MEFs at 6 h post-TNF

1.3-fold at 6 h post-TNF treatment in replicate WT samples with a detection P-value o0.05 and signal-to-noise ratio, measured as a ratio of

stimulation into seven subgroups (Figure 5a and Supplementary
Table S1). Abrogated expression of ~ 65% of genes belonging to
four clusters (cluster A–D) in Rela−/−Relb−/−Rel−/− cells reiterated a
dominant role of NFκB in TNF-induced gene expression.
Remarkably, TNF-stimulated gene expression was qualitatively
intact in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs in three out of four NFκBdependent clusters. Our quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR
analyses revealed that TNF induces expression of mRNAs
Oncogene (2017) 1417 – 1429

encoding pro-inﬂammatory mediators, such as IP-10, MCP-1
and RANTES (Figure 5b), as well as pro-survival factors, including TRAF1, cIAP2 and cFLIP (Figure 5c), in WT MEFs, but not in
Rela−/−Relb−/−Rel−/− MEFs. Inducible expression of these NFκB
target genes was mostly preserved, and if anything was subtly
enhanced, in Nfkb2−/− cells, which stimulates both RelA:p50 and
RelB:p50 activity (Figures 5b and c). Intriguingly, TNF stimulation
led to equivalent synthesis of these mRNAs, except for RANTES, in
Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figures 5b and c). shRNA-mediated
depletion of RelB abrogated TNF-induced expressions of these
genes in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 5d and Supplementary
Figure S5a). However, TNF-induced expression of cFOS, whose
transcription is regulated in an NFκB independent manner,
remained unaltered upon RelB knockdown in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/−
MEFs (Figure 5d and Supplementary Figure S5b). Finally, our ChIP
analyses revealed that TNF stimulation indeed promotes recruitment of RelB, in addition to RelA, to promoters of genes encoding
cFLIP and cIAP2 in Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 5e). Therefore, our gene
expression study conﬁrmed that RelB:p50 dimer activated by TNF
in p100-deﬁcient cells is capable of inducing expression of a wide
spectrum of NFκB target genes, thereby largely circumventing the
requirement of RelA. Furthermore, these results extended
the possibility that TNF-induced RelB:p50 activity provides for the
pro-survival NFκB transcription function in p100-depleted
myeloma cells.
TNF induced RelB:p50/NFκB dimer suppresses apoptosis
independent of RelA
TNF-induced pro-survival factors, such as TRAF1 and cFLIP,
counteracts caspase activation in preventing apoptotic cell
death.34 Sensitivity of Rela−/− MEFs to TNF-induced apoptosis
underscored the importance of RelA/NFκB-driven pro-survival
gene expressions in the cell-death pathway.35 Given capacity
of the RelB:p50 dimer in stimulating expression of these
pro-survival factors, we asked if alternate RelB/NFκB activity
suppresses apoptosis in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs. As a control, we
utilized Rela−/−Nfkb1−/− cells, which lack RelA as well as p50,
thus resulting in the deﬁciency of both RelA:p50 and RelB:p50
dimers (Supplementary Figure S6a). Our immunoblot analyses
revealed augmented processing of pro-Caspase-8 and proCaspase-3 as well as cleavage of PARP1 upon TNF treatment of
Rela−/−Nfkb1−/− MEFs, but not in WT cells (Figure 6a). TNF
stimulation of Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs led to minor change in
abundance of pro-Caspases accompanied by only a subtle
increase in cleaved Caspase-3 and PARP1. In cell-death assay, we
could demonstrate that Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs are indeed resistant
to TNF-induced death, while Rela−/− Nfkb1−/− cells are extremely
susceptible (Figure 6b). Importantly, Nfkb2−/− MEFs were impervious to TNF-induced cell death. Our ﬂuorescence-activated
cell sorting analyses validated that early apoptosis detected in
Rela−/−Nfkb1−/− MEFs within 4 h of TNF treatment is essentially
absent in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs as in WT cells (Figure 6c and
Supplementary Figure S6b). Ablating RelB expression using shRNA,
we conﬁrmed that the RelB:p50 dimer is critical for preventing
TNF activation of caspases in Rela−/−Nfkb2−/− MEFs (Figure 6d)
and protecting these RelA-null cells from apoptosis (Figure 6e).
Thus our investigation offered direct genetic evidence that RelB:
p50/NFκB activation by TNF in p100-deﬁcient cells is sufﬁcient,
and RelA is not required, to suppress the apoptotic cell death.
Autoregulatory RelB/NFκB pathway promotes pro-survival gene
expressions in multiple myeloma
Our mechanistic studies involving various knockout cells illuminated
that p100 deﬁciency provokes autoregulatory RelB:p50/NFκB
activity, which can mediate pro-survival TNF functions. We
argued that this mechanism accentuates drug resistance in
myeloma. To examine this hypothesis, we ﬁrst compared

IκBα-immunoprecipitates derived from HMCLs for the presence of
RelB. Corroborating ﬁbroblast studies, our analyses revealed
dominant RelB–IκBα interaction in unstimulated KMS28PE and
JK6L cells those lack p100, but not in OciMy5 cells (Figure 7a).
Furthermore, perpetuating RelB:p50 response to TNF in KMS28PE
and JK6L cells (Figure 2a) temporally coincided with gradual
accumulation of RelB mRNA (Figure 7b). TNF stimulated RelB
mRNA synthesis (Figure 7c) as well as RelB:p50 DNA-binding
activity (Figure 7d) independent of RelA in KMS28PE cells
suggesting that autoregulatory RelB control prolongs NFκB
response in p100-depleted HMCLs. Conversely, overexpression of
a mutant version of p100 (p100S866A,S870A), which was resistant to
NIK-mediated degradation,19 in KMS28PE cells led to a drastic
reduction in TNF-induced RelB:p50 NFκB activity (Figure 7e and
Supplementary Figure S7). Corroborating our observation that
RelB:p50 may provide for pro-survival NFκB function, solitary RelB:
p50 activation in the absence of RelA was sufﬁcient for TNFinduced expression of NFκB target genes encoding TRAF1, cFLIP
and Bcl2 in KMS28PE cells (Figure 7f). Consistently, shRNAmediated depletion of RelB, which primarily constitutes the NFκB
activity in KMS28PE cells at 8 h post-TNF stimulation, entirely
abrogated late induction of these pro-survival factors (Figure 7f).
Taken together, p100 depletion reinforced pro-survival TNF
response in multiple myeloma by prolonging classical NFκB
function via the autoregulatory RelB pathway. Functional redundancy with RelA:p50 dimer coupled to distinct dynamic control
allowed RelB:p50 to instill a protracted drug-resistant state
in HMCLs.
To further validate our mechanistic hypothesis, we examined
gene-expression proﬁle and clinical data of myeloma patients
available on the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation database
(themmrf.org). Our analyses revealed that Bcl2 and cFLIP mRNA
levels were augmented in the patient group with high RelB mRNA
expression as compared with those expressing RelB at a low level
(Figure 7g). Moreover, RelB mRNA level was signiﬁcantly elevated
in the group of patients exhibiting progressive or stable disease or
only partial response upon ﬁrst-line therapy as compared with the
group showing complete or stringent complete responses
(Figure 7h). Given persistently elevated RelB mRNA expression
was dependent on autoregulatory synthesis, we argue that the
direct correlation of RelB level with pro-survival gene expressions
and resistance to therapeutic intervention is consistent to a

DISCUSSION
Activation of canonical NFκB signaling in myeloma cells by
tumor microenvironment derived TNF has been implicated in
environmental drug resistance. Recurrent gain-of-function mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module indicated its possible
involvement in the resilience of myeloma cells to chemotherapeutic agents. We found that while TNF induces an early NFκB
activity, mutational activation of the non-canonical module
prolongs TNF-induced pro-survival NFκB response, albeit
composed of the RelB:p50 dimer, in exacerbating TRAIL resistance
(Figure 8).
Our quantitative analyses indicated that IκBα is a less-preferred
interaction partner of RelB, which favors p100 binding
(Supplementary Appendix Figures 2b and c). However, depletion
of p100, owing to non-canonical mutations, altered the cellular
homeostasis with RelB:p50 being sequestered by IκBα and
consequently, induced upon TNF stimulation as an early NFκB
activity (Figures 2, 3 and 7). Absence of p100 in mutant cells
additionally triggered a late-acting RelB:p50/NFκB response, which
was contingent upon autoregulatory Relb synthesis (Figures 2–4
and 8). IKK2 was shown to phosphorylate RelB at 6 h post-TNF
stimulation that further weakened RelB–IκBα interaction.36 It has
been suggested that ERK1, which is activated by TNF, also
phosphorylates RelB in promoting its nuclear translocation.26
Implementing the delayed phosphorylation mechanism in our
computational model explained that late-acting RelB:p50 dimer
escaped this debilitated IκBα feedback to uninterruptedly
synthesize RelB mRNA in cancerous cells.
In a pioneering study, Karin’s group earlier demonstrated that
expression of cJun proto-oncogene is subjected to positive
autoregulation.37 An autoregulatory loop connecting IRF4 and
MYC was shown to perpetuate oncogenic gene expressions in
multiple myeloma.38 Epigenetic changes associated with colon
cancer were shown to trigger hypoxia-inducible factor-1α
autoregulation.39 An autoregulatory circuit propagated T-cell
acute lymphocytic leukemia protein 1 (TAL1) activity in T-cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia.40 Except for Rela, genes encoding
the NFκB subunits per se also bear κB sites at their promoters.
In this study, we extended evidence for the involvement of
autoregulatory NFκB control in neoplastic diseases. Genetic
analyses and mathematical modeling studies substantiated that
depletion of p100 in myeloma cells triggers this autoregulatory
loop to promote perpetuating RelB:p50/NFκB response to TNF.
Strikingly, this TNF-induced, persistent RelB:p50 activity was
impervious to RelA inhibitions (Figures 4 and 7d). Our mechanistic
investigation indicated that early RelB:p50 activation from IκBαbound complex is critical for triggering this late-acting RelB:p50
response, particularly when RelA is inactivated.
It was shown that malignant plasma cells possess a low level
of NIK-independent, constitutive RelB/NFκB activity. While this
activity was initially implicated in expression of NFκB target
genes,27 a recent investigation suggested that RelB:p52
suppresses expression of NFκB target pro-apoptotic gene
Bim.26 Indeed, RelB was shown both to activate and inhibit
physiological

expressions

promoters,31,41–44 and RelA, cRel or RelB containing NFκB
heterodimers were shown to overlap in their DNA-binding
speciﬁcity.45,46 However, the perceived notion that RelA is
obligatorily required for expression of Relb47 restricted genetic
studies directly evaluating RelB mediated regulations of NFκB
target genes in the absence of RelA. Our analyses provided
unequivocal evidence that RelB:p50 dimer not only cooperates
with RelA:p50 but transcription-activating function of RelB:p50
circumvents the requirement of RelA in mediating pro-survival

An autoregulatory NF-κB pathway in myeloma

TNF response in p100-depleted cells, including myeloma cells
harboring non-canonical mutations (Figures 5–7). Although,
we do not rule out that RelB, particularly in association with p52,
functions as a transcriptional repressor in the basal state in
HMCLs, our investigation indicated that TNF-induced RelB:p50
acts as a potent activator of pro-survival gene expressions.
Mutational activation of the non-canonical NFκB pathway
modiﬁed TNF signaling to impart drug resistance in myeloma
cells independent of the principal NFκB subunit RelA. Interestingly,
these mutations did not act through typical p52 NFκB complexes,
but depleted p100 to reposition RelB under IκBα control.
Of note, myeloma-derived cells with enhanced NIK activity were
shown to be sensitive to IKK2 inhibitors.22 Our study clariﬁed that
NIK depletes p100, while IKK2 induces pro-survival RelB:p50/NFκB
response from IκBα-inhibited complex. Moreover, autoregulatory
RelB:p50 activation by TNF assisted these cells develop autonomy
from RelA/NFκB in producing a protracted drug-refractory state.
It is thought that the non-canonical RelB/NFκB pathway transduces signal selectively from cell-differentiating cues, and
TNF utilizes the canonical RelA/NFκB pathway. We noted that
TNF-induced RelA is insufﬁcient for imparting TRAIL resistance
(Figures 1 and 2). Rather autoregulatory RelB control mediated
precarious collaboration between widespread cell-intrinsic mutations in the non-canonical NFκB module and dynamical signaling
induced by TNF in multiple myeloma. The proposed autoregulatory control is consistent to the previous ﬁnding demonstrating
heightened RelB mRNA levels in myeloma patients harboring
mutations in non-canonical NFκB module.22 Our observation
that high RelB level is correlated with augmented expression of
pro-survival factors and resistance of patients to therapy also
indicated possible involvement of autoregulatory RelB control in
multiple myeloma (Figure 7). In addition to genetic mutations,
BAFF and APRIL also activate the non-canonical NFκB pathway in
mature B-cells and myeloma cells.48 In this context, future studies
ought to investigate the possible role of autoregulatory RelB
control in transducing BAFF signal in processes requiring
prolonged NFκB activity, such as B-cell differentiation and
myeloma cell survival.
Our identiﬁcation that the non-canonical pathway reinforces
canonical TNF response through RelB:p50/NFκB dimer reiterates
the importance of system-level understanding of pathway
integration for designing therapeutic interventions. In sum,
highly networked systems controlling functionally redundant
transcription factors are also vulnerable to cancerous mutations,
which may reverse the feedback control hardwired in the
inﬂammatory circuit. Our results also indicate that acquisition
of mutations those provoke autoregulatory activation of
pro-survival transcription factors constitutes an important
mechanism in environmental drug resistance.

accordance with the IAEC guidelines. MEFs, immortalized using 3T3 protocol,
were generated from E13.5 embryos, as described.32 HMCLs were a kind gift
from Dr Michael Kuehl, NCI. Indicated transgenes were either constitutively
expressed from MoMLV LTR promoter from pBabe.puro or inducibly expressed
from an engineered promoter containing ﬁve tandem kappaB sites from HRS.
puro retroviral construct. Retrovirus particle were generated from 293 T cells cotransfected with pCL-Eco.32 For gene transduction into human-derived
myeloma cells, pseudotyped retrovirus particles were produced using Retro-X
Universal Packaging System (Clonetech, Mountain View, CA, USA) from GP2-293
cells co-transfected with pBabe.puro construct and Ampho envelope vector
(Clonetech). Following shRNA-expressing lentiviral particles (Sigma Aldrich,
St Louis, MO, USA) were used for knockdown in HMCLs: Rela#1TRCN0000353629, Rela#2-TRCN000029875, Relb#1-TRCN0000280360, Relb#2TRCN0000280361, Nfkb2#1-TRCN0000356047 and Nfkb2#2-TRCN0000356005,
and control-SHC202V. For knockdown studies in ﬁbroblasts, lentiviral

constructs expressing control shRNA (#RHS4346) or RelB-shRNAs (RMM#4431101264262 and RMM#4431-200408572) purchased from GE-Dharmacon
(Lafayette, CO, USA) were used for generating lentiviral particles.49

Biochemical analyses
MEFs and HMCLs stimulated using 1 and 10 ng/ml of TNF (Roche, Basel,
Switzerland), respectively, were harvested, nuclear, cytoplasmic or wholecell extracts were analyzed by EMSA, supershift analysis, immunoblotting
or subjected to immunoprecipitation.50 Antibody against p50 (BB-AB0080)
was from BioBharati Life Sciences (Kolkata, India). Antibodies against
Caspase-8 (#4790), Caspase-3 (#9665) and PARP1 (#9542) were from
CST (Danvers, MA, USA).

Gene-expression analyses
Total RNA was isolated from cells stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TNF and
quantitative reverse transcriptase–PCR was conducted, as described,50
using cDNA synthesis kit from BioBharati. For microarray analysis,
labeling, hybridization to Illumina MouseRef-8 v2.0 Expression BeadChip,
data processing and quantile normalization were performed by Sandor
Pvt Ltd (Hyderabad, India). Differential expression of genes between
different genotypes were analyzed by k-median clustering implemented
in the MEV program.51 The MIAME version of the microarray data is
available on NCBI-GEO (accession GSE68615). For ChIP, 3 × 106 MEFs
stimulated with 10 ng/ml of TNF were ﬁxed with 2% formaldehyde,
nuclei were isolated, sonicated and lysates were subjected to
immunoprecipitation using indicated antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA). Subsequent to reverse cross-linking, genomic DNA
fragments were extracted from immunopellet and analyzed by qPCR
using speciﬁc primers.

Cell-death studies
TNF-induced (1 ng/ml) cell death in MEFs was quantiﬁed at 18 h
post-stimulation using crystal violet staining, as described.52 TRAILinduced (100 ng/ml; Adipogen, San Diego, CA, USA) cell death in HMCLs
was assessed in trypan blue dye exclusion assay. HMCLs were primed
with 10 ng/ml of TNF. Apoptosis was scored at 4 h post-stimulation using
annexin-V/FITC and propidium iodide (BD Biosciences) staining. Flow
cytometry was performed using VERSE (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes,
NJ, USA) at NII Central facility with the help from A Das, NII, and data
were analyzed using FlowJo.

Computational modeling and code availability
The NF-κB Systems Model v2.0 was developed based on previously
published models,31,50 reﬁned using our experimental data and was
simulated in Matlab. A detailed description including parameter values has
been provided in Supplementary Appendix. Matlab codes are available
upon request.

Statistical analysis
Error bars are shown as s.e.m. of 3–5 biological replicates, which was
determined according to the standard practices for cell-culture-based
analyses. Exact numbers of replicates for each experiment have been
indicated in the legends of the corresponding ﬁgures. Statistical
signiﬁcance between groups was calculated using two-tailed Student’s
t-test and the P-values have been mentioned in the respective ﬁgures. For
analyses of patients data obtained from Multiple Myeloma Research
Foundation, Welch’s t-test was used.
