It has been estimated that genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US. Nononcogenic types, such as HPV
type 6 (HPV-6) and HPV-11, can cause benign or low-grade cervical cell changes,
genital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Oncogenic types can

cause cervical and other anogenital cancers; oncogenic HPV types are detected
in 99% of cervical cancers worldwide. A quadrivalent HPV vaccine to prevent
HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18 was licensed for use in the US in June 2006
and an application for Food and Drug Administration licensure was submitted
for a bivalent HPV vaccine to prevent HPV-16 and HPV-18 in March 2007. Currently in the US, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is recommended for routine
immunization of girls aged 11 and 12 years, and catch-up immunization is
recommended through age 26 years. Monitoring the impact of prophylactic HPV
vaccines will be useful for understanding the population level impact of vaccination. In this report, the authors provide a brief review of the epidemiology of
HPV infection and an overview of prophylactic HPV vaccines and postvaccine
licensure monitoring. Cancer 2008;113(10 suppl):2995–3003. Published 2008 by

t has been estimated that genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is
the most common sexually transmitted infection in the US.1
Papillomaviruses are a family of DNA viruses that have a doublestranded, closed, circular genome of 8 kilobases (kb) and a nonenveloped, icosahedral capsid. HPVs have a human species-specific
tropism and infect only mucosal or cutaneous epithelium. There are
more than 100 HPV types, which are characterized further as mucosal or cutaneous: The cutaneous types can cause common skin
warts; whereas the mucosal types have primary affinity for the genital and oral mucosa and can cause genital warts, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis, and certain anogenital and oropharyngeal
cancers. Most infections are asymptomatic, cause no disease, and
become undetectable within 2 years of acquisition.2,3 Persistent HPV
infection is the most important risk factor for the development of
outcomes of HPV infection such as cervical cancer precursor lesions
and cervical cancer.

Genital (or mucosal) HPV types are categorized
further according to their epidemiologic association
with cervical cancer. HPV types 16 (HPV-16), HPV-18,
HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51,
HPV-52, HPV-56, HPV-58, HPV-59, HPV-68, HPV-73,
and HPV-82 are considered oncogenic HPV types,
and another 3 types are considered most likely oncogenic.4 Nononcogenic types, such as HPV-6 and
HPV-11, can cause benign or low-grade cervical cell
changes, genital warts, and recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Oncogenic types can cause cervical cancers and other anogenital cancers. Assessments of
cervical cancers worldwide have demonstrated that
99% of cervical cancers are associated with high-risk
HPV.5 Most cervical cancers (70%) are caused by 2
high-risk HPV types, HPV-16 and HPV-18.4
A quadrivalent (HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and
HPV-18) HPV vaccine (Merck & Company, Inc.) was
licensed for use in the US in June 2006.6 An application for US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
licensure was submitted for a bivalent (HPV-16 and
HPV-18) HPV vaccine (GlaxoSmithKline) in March
2007. Both vaccines have been found to be highly
effective in preventing infection and disease associated with the types included in the vaccine.7-11 The
Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices
(ACIP) recommended the quadrivalent HPV vaccine
for routine immunization of girls aged 11 and 12
years and for catch-up immunization of young
women ages 13 through 26 years.12 Recommendations will be developed for the bivalent HPV vaccine
when this vaccine is licensed by the FDA.
This report provides a review of published information on the epidemiology of HPV infection, on
prophylactic HPV vaccines, and on recommendations
for use of HPV vaccine in the US. In addition, we
discuss vaccine implementation, including evaluation
of safety and vaccine uptake and monitoring the
impact of prophylactic HPV vaccines.

Epidemiology: Burden, Acquisition, Prevalence, and
Natural History of Infection
Burden of cancers and precancers because of HPV
The attributable fraction of cancers and other conditions caused by HPV is based on a variety of information, including epidemiological data and studies
evaluating biopsy specimens for HPV. HPV, specifically HPV-16 and HPV-18, are responsible for a considerable burden of cervical and other anogenital
cancers, oropharyngeal cancers, and cervical, vaginal,
and vulvar intraepithelial neoplasias (CIN, VaIN, and
VIN, respectively).13 The available data for the contri-

bution of HPV, and HPV-16, and HPV-18 to cervical
cancers and precancers are substantial.5,14,15 Greater
than 70% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV-16
and/or HPV-18 worldwide,5 and other HPV types,
including HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-52,
and HPV-58, contribute to the majority of the
remaining cervical cancers. The contribution of HPV
types other than HPV-16/HPV-18 to cervical cancers
varies geographically. HPV infection is the necessary
but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer, because
not all individuals with infection develop cancer.
Approximately 50% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL), which are considered a precursors to cervical cancer, are caused by HPV-16
and/or HPV-18 worldwide.15 The most common type
of cervical cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. The
next most common type is adenocarcinoma, primarily caused by HPV-18.16 Recent data suggest an important role for HPV, and HPV-16 in particular, as a
cause of vaginal and vulvar precancers; in 1 study,
91% of VIN-3 and 50% of VaIN-3 were associated
with HPV-16.17 High proportions of oropharyngeal
cancers, specifically oral and tonsillar cancers, are
associated with HPV detection, primarily HPV-16.18
Substantial proportions of anal and penile cancers
also are caused by HPV-16.19

Acquisition of HPV infection
Genital HPV is acquired most commonly through
sexual contact.20 Studies evaluating young women
after sexual debut have demonstrated that infection
is acquired rapidly soon after the initiation of sexual
intercourse. In 1 study, by 4 years after first intercourse, >50% of young women had acquired at least
1 HPV type; and, by 2 years, more than 10% had
acquired HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, or HPV-18.20
Although there are limited epidemiologic studies on
HPV transmission, models evaluating the sexual
transmissibility of genital HPV demonstrate that the
per-act transmission probability is high (62.5% assuming that the man-to-woman prevalence rate ratio is
equal).21
Prevalence of HPV infection
The prevalence of genital HPV differs by population,
sampling, and laboratory methods. The prevalence of
infection has been found to be high, although this
does not indicate persistent infection: Infection that
does not clear is a more relevant risk factor for developing cervical precancers or cancers than prevalent
infection.
There are 2 studies that have used a representative sample of girls and women in the US: the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey

Overview of Prophylactic HPV Vaccines/Dunne et al

(NHANES) and the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Wave III) Study. In NHANES,
26.8% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 23.3%30.9%) of women ages 14 to 59 years from 2003
through 2004 had HPV infection detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis on vaginal
swabs, corresponding to 24.9 million women with
prevalent infection.22 In the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health, 26.9% of women ages 18
to 26 years had HPV infection detected by PCR on
urine specimens.23 To our knowledge, there are no
representative studies of the prevalence of HPV
infection among men.
Studies in various clinic populations have
demonstrated that HPV prevalence ranges from 14%
to 90% among women24 and the prevalence varies by
venue and collection methods. In a Baltimore sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic, a venue that
serves high-risk, sexually active adolescents, 90% of
the women who were evaluated had HPV detected.25
In studies of college health clinics, the prevalence of
HPV infection generally was lower.26,27 In a large,
multisite study that sampled women from 26 primary care, family planning, and STD clinics throughout the US, oncogenic HPV prevalence ranged from
35% among young women ages 14 to 19 years and
decreased with increasing age to 6% among women
ages 50 to 65 years.28 HPV infection also is common
among men: Most studies in men have demonstrated
that >20% of men have HPV infection, depending on
the site or specimen sampled and the methods used
to assess infection.29,30
In clinic-based studies, the prevalence of HPV
infection usually is highest among women aged <20
years, and prevalence decreases with age. In some
studies (mostly conducted outside the US), there is a
second peak in older women (aged >45 years).31 In
the US NHANES study, which was population based,
HPV infection was most common in the group ages
20 to 24 years and decreased in the older age
groups.22
The cumulative incidence of HPV infection is
higher when repeat measures at short intervals are
used to assess cumulative infection.20,32 On the basis
of cumulative incidence data and available models,
most sexually active men and women will have
acquired at least 1 type of HPV infection in their
lifetime.33

Natural history of infection
Although most sexually active women acquire HPV
infection, and many have prevalent infection detected, available studies demonstrate that, by 2 years,

2997

>90% of women do not have detectable virus.2,3
Some women develop persistent infection with highrisk HPV types, and these women are at greatest risk
for developing precancer lesions, such as HSIL of the
cervix. HPV persistence is often defined as >1 visit at
least 4 months apart with the same oncogenic HPV
type detected; however, the definition varies in different studies. Factors such as smoking, older age, HPV
type, duration of infection, and suppressed immunity
have been identified as predictors of persistent infections.3,34-36 A recent study of persistent infection in a
cohort in Costa Rica produced no evidence of interactions between detection of multiple HPV types and
the incidence of new infection or persistent infection, implying that HPV types act independently.36
Despite the extensive studies evaluating the natural
history of HPV infection, the dynamics of acquisition, clearance and immune response to infection,
and transmission are incompletely understood. For
example, little is known regarding the long-term protective effect of immune response to infection or
how long antibody responses persist.

Prophylactic HPV Vaccines
Two prophylactic HPV vaccines have been developed: One is a quadrivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-6,
HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18), and the other is a
bivalent HPV vaccine (HPV-16 and HPV-18). Both
vaccines use the L1 protein of the outer surface of
the virus as the immunogen. These proteins selfassemble into conformational antigens called viruslike particles (VLPs). The quadrivalent HPV vaccine
was licensed for use in the US in June 2006. An
application for FDA licensure was submitted for the
bivalent HPV vaccine in March 2007. Both vaccines
are licensed in multiple countries worldwide and are
being used or considered for use.
Although both vaccines are L1 VLP vaccines,
they differ in the HPV type VLPs and adjuvants (Table 1). Both vaccines are given intramuscularly as a
3-dose schedule, but the timing of the second dose
differs slightly. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine contains an aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate adjuvant that also is used in other licensed vaccines in
the US. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine consists of
HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18 VLPs produced
in yeast. The adjuvant in the bivalent HPV vaccine is
aluminum hydroxide and monophosphorolipid A
(ASO4), a novel adjuvant that also is used in a hepatitis B vaccine licensed for use in dialysis patients in
Europe. The bivalent HPV vaccine has HPV-16 and
HPV-18 VLPs produced in a baculovirus expression
system.

Both vaccines have been identified as highly
effective in preventing infection and disease associated with types included in the vaccine among
young women ages 15 to 26 years. For the quadrivalent vaccine, efficacy was reported for the outcomes
of VIN, VaIN, CIN, adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS), and
external genital lesions, including condyloma. For
the bivalent vaccine, efficacy was reported for the
outcomes of CIN and AIS. For the quadrivalent HPV
vaccine, 2 phase 3 efficacy studies included women
from over 30 countries in North America, South
America, Europe, Australia, and Asia who had a
mean follow-up of 3 years.37,38 For the bivalent HPV
vaccine, to date, published analysis of the phase 3
efficacy study has included >18,000 women enrolled
from 14 different countries with a mean follow-up of
14.8 months.11 All studies were randomized, doubleblind clinical trials.
A variety of different clinical outcomes were evaluated in HPV vaccine phase 3 trials including HPV16– and HPV-18–related CIN-2/CIN-3, HPV vaccine
type-related CIN. For the quadrivalent HPV vaccine,
data also have been presented on HPV-6–, HPV-11–,
HPV-16–, and HPV-18–related VIN-2/VIN-3 or VaIN2/VaIN-3 and on HPV-6–, HPV-11–, HPV-16–, and
HPV-18–related condyloma (Table 2).
Published analyses have included several different study populations from the trials. The per-protocol population included participants with no
evidence of the relevant HPV type infection based on
DNA or serologic assessments (naive women) at
baseline and through 1 month after the third dose,
and cases were counted after the third vaccine dose,
at Month 7. The unrestricted susceptible or total vaccinated cohort population was naive to the relevant
HPV types at baseline, and cases were counted after
the first dose; this population was the only population that was reported for both vaccines in phase 3
trials. The efficacy for prevention of HPV-16/HPV-18–

related CIN-2/CIN-3 ranged from 90.4% to 98% for
the vaccines.11,38 The overall HPV vaccine typerelated CIN efficacy ranged from 89.2% to 100%.11,37
The quadrivalent vaccine also demonstrated 91% to
100% efficacy against HPV-6–, HPV-11–, HPV-16–,
HPV-18–related VIN-2/VIN-3 or VaIN-2/VaIN-3 and
96% to 100% efficacy against HPV-6–, HPV-11–, HPV16–, HPV-18–related condyloma.37
Current data do not indicate that the vaccines
have any therapeutic effect among women who are
infected at the time of vaccination: The quadrivalent
vaccine did not prevent progression to disease or the
regression of existing lesions.38 In the bivalent vaccine trial, women with existing HPV infection who
were enrolled into the vaccine group did not have
any improved clearance of HPV infection.39 Thus, the
vaccine would have maximum benefit when given
before sexual debut.
Intent-to-treat analyses or analyses that included
all study participants in the vaccine and placebo
groups, regardless of HPV status at baseline, demonstrated that the efficacy of the HPV vaccine was less
than among naive women. This was expected,
because the vaccines do not have any therapeutic
effect, and some women were infected at the time of
study enrollment and were included in these analyses. The efficacy for prevention of HPV-16/HPV-18–
related CIN-2/CIN-3 or AIS in the intent-to-treat
population was 44% (95% CI, 31%-55%).38 When the
women who were included in this analysis were followed to 36 months, all but 3 cases of HPV-16/HPV18–related CIN-2/CIN-3 or AIS occurred in participants who were infected with HPV-16/HPV-18 at
baseline.38 The efficacy for prevention of any HPVrelated CIN-2/CIN-3 or AIS in the intent-to-treat
population for the quadrivalent HPV vaccine was
18% (95% CI, 7%-29%). The difference in efficacy
among the intent-to-treat population and the perprotocol population most likely was caused by exist-

ing vaccine type infection at the beginning of the
study.
Both vaccines produce a vigorous immune
response, with essentially all vaccinees developing an
antibody response after vaccination.40,41 Antibody
titers were measured by different methods for the 2
vaccines: For the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, a multiplexed luminex assay was used.42 For the bivalent
HPV vaccine, a VLP enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay was used.43 Results from immunogenicity
studies reported geometric mean titers (GMTs) and
seroconversion. By Month 7 in trials of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine, seroconversion rates were 99%
for all 4 HPV types.44 On completion of a 3-dose regimen, anti-HPV–6, anti-HPV–11, anti-HPV–16, and
anti-HPV–18 antibody levels were 10- to 104-fold
higher than those observed in these placebo recipients who were vaccine-type HPV seropositive and
PCR negative at enrollment (assumed to represent
antibody titers after natural infection).45 Through 5
years, vaccine-induced anti-HPV GMTs remained at
or above those observed after natural infection.10 In
phase 3 studies of the bivalent HPV vaccine, >99.5%
of women had detectable HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody after the second and third doses.11 In the bivalent vaccine trials, vaccinees had detectable antibody
at the end of a 4.5-year follow-up, and the GMTs at
51 to 53 months were 17-fold and 14-fold higher
than the HPV-16 and HPV-18 GMTs after natural
infections.43 The longevity of immune response and

the minimum protective antibody response both
remain unknown. It is unclear whether differing
antibody titers indicate better disease protection or
longer duration of immune protection.
Bridging immunogenicity studies have been
conducted in women who were younger than the
women who were included in the efficacy studies.
For the quadrivalent vaccine, the antibody responses
among girls ages 10 to 15 years were not inferior and
were 1.7- to 2.7-fold higher than the antibody
responses observed in young women ages 16 to 23
years.44 Data from the bivalent vaccine demonstrated
that 100% of women in both age groups (10-14 years
and 15-25 years) who received the vaccine developed
antibodies after vaccination. GMTs in the group ages
10 to 14 years were not inferior to those in the group
ages 15 to 25 years and were 2 times higher.41
Studies have also been conducted in women
older than the women who were included in the
phase 3 efficacy studies. In a study of 3800 women
ages 24 to 45 years, the quadrivalent HPV vaccine
prevented 91% of cases of persistent infection, lowgrade cervical abnormalities, precancers, and genital
warts caused by HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, or HPV18.46 In studies of the immune response to bivalent
vaccine in women ages >25 years to 55 years, the
immune response was not inferior to that demonstrated for the women ages 15 to 25 years.47
Both vaccines have demonstrated cross-protection to types other than those in the vaccine. HPV

types are organized by phylogenetic relatedness, and
certain types have a close relation to types in the
vaccines, HPV-16 and HPV-18. Types related to HPV16 include HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-52, and
HPV-58. Types related to HPV-18 include HPV-39,
HPV-45, HPV-59, and HPV-68. Evaluations of the
quadrivalent HPV vaccine found cross-protection
against CIN-2/3 and AIS due to HPV 31/33/45/52
and 58 (efficacy, 45%; 95% CI, 10, 68).48 Studies of
the bivalent HPV vaccine found statistically significant reductions in 6-month persistent infections due
to types 45, 31, and 52 and an efficacy of 27% (97.9%
CI, 0.5-46.8) for prevention of 12-month persistent
infection due to 12 oncogenic types (not including
16 or 18).11 There is limited understanding of what
cross-protection will mean in the population. Reductions in persistent infections do not necessarily imply
reductions in disease; also, reductions in CIN-2/CIN3 and AIS were unclear, because many individuals
had multiple infections, and it was unclear which
HPV type contributed to disease.
Vaccine safety evaluations during the clinical
trials of the quadrivalent vaccine demonstrated that
the most commonly reported systemic, adverse
events were headaches (23.2%) and fever (13.1%).44
The majority of infection-site adverse events were
mild to moderate in intensity (79.4% of girls ages 1015 years reported pain/tenderness or soreness at the
site of injection).44
Injection site symptoms (pain, redness, and
swelling) also were more frequently reported in the
vaccine group than in the control group in trials of
the bivalent vaccine.11 Most local symptoms lasted
from 2.2 days to 3.4 days.11 Neither the bivalent or
quadrivalent clinical trial protocols included pregnant women; however, some women became pregnant during the trial and were evaluated for
outcomes of the pregnancy. There was no overall dif-

ference in pregnancy outcomes between the HPV
vaccine and control groups for either vaccine.9,11

Recommendations for Quadrivalent HPV Vaccine Use
The quadrivalent HPV vaccine has been recommended for routine immunization of girls aged 11
and 12 years and for catch-up immunization of
young women ages 13 through 26 years in the US by
the ACIP and other organizations12 (Table 3). Recommendations will be developed for the bivalent HPV
vaccine when this vaccine is licensed by the FDA.
The rationale for recommending the routine immunization of girls aged 11 and 12 years is that they are
less likely to have had a sexual debut and would be
naive to vaccine type infections. In addition, immune
responses were vigorous in this age group. Several
professional groups recommend a routine adolescent
healthcare visit at ages 11 and 12 years, and the routine immunization of girls at this age with the HPV
vaccine would fit into this platform.
Recommendations for vaccine use have been
published by a variety of professional and academic
organizations, including the American College of
Obstetrics and Gynecology, the American Academy
of Pediatrics, and the American Cancer Society
(ACS).49-52 Many of these recommendations do not
differ from those published by the ACIP. The ACSpublished recommendations differ, in that they recommend basing the decision to vaccinate women
ages 19 to 26 years on an informed discussion between
the woman and her healthcare provider.50,51
Vaccination is not a substitute for routine cervical cancer screening, and vaccinated individuals
should have cervical cancer screening as currently
recommended. HPV vaccination may result in
changes in cervical cancer screening in the future.52
Because the quadrivalent HPV vaccine is not a live
vaccine, it can be administered to immunocompro-

Overview of Prophylactic HPV Vaccines/Dunne et al

mised individuals; however, vaccine efficacy may be
less than that in individuals who are immunocompetent. The quadrivalent vaccine is not recommended
for use in pregnancy. If it is determined that a
woman is pregnant after initiating the vaccination
series, then the remainder of the 3-dose regimen
should be delayed until after completion of the pregnancy. The precautions for administration include
minor acute illnesses, and the vaccine should be
deferred until after the illness improves. Quadrivalent
HPV vaccine is contraindicated for individuals who
have a history of immediate hypersensitivity to yeast
or any vaccine component. Although it is possible
that vaccination of men with the quadrivalent vaccine may offer direct health benefits to men and
indirect health benefits to women, there are currently
no efficacy data available to support the use of HPV
vaccine in men. Efficacy studies in men are ongoing.

Postlicensure Monitoring
Postlicensure monitoring includes evaluation of vaccine coverage, vaccine safety, and impact on disease
outcomes.
Vaccine coverage
Evaluation of vaccine uptake in the community is important for understanding implementation challenges
and to measure the impact of vaccination on disease
and infection endpoints. Vaccine coverage traditionally has been measured in the US through national surveys, such as the National Immunization Survey, the
National Survey of Children’s Health, and the National
Health Interview Survey. Some surveys have been
expanded to collect additional data on adolescent
immunizations, including HPV vaccine.54 Vaccine
registries and local studies will provide additional
detailed and local information on vaccine uptake.
Safety
Ongoing monitoring of vaccine safety occurs through
2 main mechanisms at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): passive reporting through
the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System
(VAERS) and special studies and evaluations through
the Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD) Project.55 Both of
these systems are a collaboration between the CDC
and the FDA. VAERS reports are useful to document
associated serious or moderate adverse events after
vaccination; however, as a passive reporting system,
it is insufficient to provide detailed information on
the association with vaccination. The VSD Project is a
collaboration between the CDC and a group of managed care organizations (MCOs) that investigate possible vaccine-related events through systematic studies

3001

and evaluations of data collected in the MCOs.56
Both of these systems provide periodic updated information on safety to the general public, the FDA,
and advisory committees. In special cases, studies
evaluating specific hypotheses can be conducted in
the VSD Project.

Disease impact
Monitoring the impact of the HPV vaccine will be
important to describe the population level impact of
vaccination, and duration of protection after vaccination. In addition, ongoing systems to monitor impact
of the vaccine may answer questions concerning the
effect of this vaccine on other HPV types (type replacement). A potentially important limitation to the
collection of surveillance data on many outcomes of
interest is the lack of a system that routinely collects
these data (either as a nationally notifiable condition
or as a routine surveillance activity).
Proximal measures of vaccine impact include
outcomes such as HPV infection, cervical cancer precursors, vaginal and vulvar cancer precursors, and
anogenital warts. Proximal measures are optimal for
monitoring because they will detect an impact
(either disease reduction or vaccine type infection
reduction) earlier than cancer outcomes. Planned
CDC evaluations for cervical cancer precursors such
as CIN-2/CIN-3, carcinoma in situ, or AIS include
population-based assessments of CIN-2/CIN-3 and
evaluation of administrative databases, cancer registries, and sentinel sites with specific populations.
An advantage to monitoring anogenital warts as
an early marker of vaccine impact is that most genital warts are caused by HPV-6 or HPV-11, and widespread use of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in
appropriate age groups could have a dramatic effect
on the incidence of genital warts. The CDC plans to
monitor genital warts through sentinel surveillance
in STD clinics and administrative databases.
A distal measure of vaccine impact includes
cervical cancer cases that are reported routinely
through a system of state-based cancer registries
(the National Program of Cancer Registries and the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program), covering up to 100% of the US population.
However, it may take as long as 20 or 30 years before
an impact on this outcome is detected. Vaginal, vulvar, other anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers are
also reported routinely as a part of these cancer
registries; however, the impact of the prophylactic
HPV vaccine on these outcomes may be difficult to
monitor because these cancers are relatively rare.
Planned evaluations of HPV types in cervical
specimens may be useful to measure the expected

reduction in HPV-16 and HPV-18 as well as the theoretical concern of type replacement. Evaluations of
HPV types are occurring in several ongoing or completed projects including the NHANES, a sentinel
network of cervical cancer screening clinics, 2 managed care organizations, demonstration projects in
areas with high cervical cancer morbidity, and population-based studies of CIN 2/3. In addition, projects
evaluating HPV types in anogenital cancers are
planned. Finally, studies on the duration of immune
response and special studies to evaluate long-term
efficacy are planned to address questions about
booster immunizations.

Conclusions
Genital HPV infection is a common infection that
can lead to a variety of HPV-associated diseases and
cancers in men and women. Two prophylactic HPV
vaccines have demonstrated high efficacy against
disease caused by the vaccine types in women who
were naive to infection. Widespread use of a prophylactic HPV vaccine could reduce cancer precursor
lesions and cancers associated with HPV types in the
vaccine. The quadrivalent HPV vaccine is licensed in
the US and is recommended for routine use among
females aged 11 and 12 years, and the bivalent HPV
vaccine may be licensed soon. New policy issues and
recommendations will need to be addressed as additional data become available from clinical trials and
epidemiologic studies.
