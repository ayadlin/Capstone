ABSTRACT
Dysregulation of cell metabolism is critical for the growth properties of cancer
cells. The purpose of this study was to understand the role of substrate transport
across the mitochondrial membrane to sustain the metabolic shift and redox defense
in cancer cells. Mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10 is up-regulated in a variety of tumors
and is involved in regulating intracellular levels of reactive oxygen species. We show
that knockdown of SLC25A10 in A549 cells changed the growth properties to a less
malignant phenotype and casued increased glutamine dependency and sensitivity
to oxidative stress. The metabolic alteration was linked to an energy metabolic
shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation illustrated by
increased expression of glutamate dehydrogenase, decreased expression of lactate
dehydrogenase due to down-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α. We identified
effects on NADPH production linked to the growth changes observed in SLC25A10
knockdown cells, demonstrated by decreased NADPH production in cells deprived
of glutamine. The contribution of SLC25A10 to reprogram cell metabolism and to
regulate cell growth suggests SLC25A10 as a novel target for anti-cancer strategies.

hyperpolarization of mitochondria and increased ROS
levels when SLC25A10 was over expressed in cultured
cells [7]. Altogether, the evidence suggests that SLC25A10
participates in both energy metabolism and redox
homeostasis. Interestingly, increased SLC25A10 expression
has been demonstrated in a variety of tumors although the
exact role of SLC25A10 in tumor cells is not known [8,
9]. In addition to SLC25A10, other mitochondrial carriers
of the SLC25 family are also involved in cancer [10–12].
Altered energy metabolism and redox homeostasis is
frequently identified in tumor cells [13, 14]. A result of
these metabolic changes is that the production of NADPH
and glutathione (GSH), both important anti-oxidants, is
modulated in cancer cells [15]. NADPH is crucial for the
biosynthesis of macromolecules as well as to defend cells
from oxidative stress and GSH is the major antioxidant
produced by cells. The production of NADPH has been
suggested to be of special importance for cancer cell
metabolism [15]. In proliferating cells NADPH is mainly
produced through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP),
but important contributions to NADPH production is also
through the reaction converting malate to pyruvate [16].

INTRODUCTION
The solute carrier 25 (SLC25) family of nuclearencoded transporters in the mitochondrial inner membrane
are involved in numerous metabolic pathways. Based
on substrate specificity these carriers are divided into
subfamilies with different functional characteristics [1].
The major role of SLC25 family member 10 (SLC25A10),
also known as dicarboxylate carrier, is to transport
the dicarboxylate substrates malate and succinate,
out of the mitochondria in exchange for phosphate,
sulfate, and thiosulfate, thus supplying substrates for
gluconeogenesis, urea synthesis, and sulfur metabolism
[2]. By doing that, it maintains the balance of the TCA
cycle intermediates between the mitochondria and the
cytosol [3, 4]. Suppression of SLC25A10 has been shown
to reduce the citrate transport from mitochondria to the
cytosol and inhibit the de novo fatty acid synthesis in
hepatocytes [5]. This carrier was also shown to participate
in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion through pyruvatecycling [6]. Furthermore, the SLC25A10 carrier has been
linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production with

Based on the evidence of altered expression of
SLC25A10 in tumor cells we were interested in the role of
SLC25A10 to maintain the growth properties of tumor cells
in culture. Here, we investigated the effects of decreased
expression of SLC25A10 on cell growth, NADPH
production and redox homeostasis in the non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549. Overall our study
proposes the importance of a functional SLC25A10 carrier
to maintain properties of cancer cells, such as NADPH
production independent of the PPP pathway. Gene
expression analysis of key regulatory enzymes involved
in cell metabolism and cell redox homeostasis provide
evidence for a metabolic shift from aerobic glycolysis
to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in confluent
SLC25A10 knockdown cells.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the
SLC25A10 carrier plays an important role in regulating
redox homeostasis to protect confluent cells against
oxidative stress. We propose SLC25A10 as a novel target
for anti-tumor compound development with the aim to
reprogram cell metabolism, compromise cell growth
and increase sensitivity to the important anticancer drug
cisplatin.

at a single side of the cell nucleus, and not surrounding
the nucleus, as compared to siRNA-CON (Figure 1D)
especially in confluent cells with 89% and 12% positive
cells in siRNA-SLC and siRNA-CON cells respectively
(p < 0, 001). Meanwhile, the gene expression of two genes
important for mitochondrial morphology, dynamin-related
protein 1 (DRP1) and mitofusin 1 (MFN1), which control
mitochondrial fusion and fission respectively, were not
significantly changed as determined by real-time PCR
(Figure 1G).

Increased dependency on glutamine in confluent
siRNA-SLC cells
SLC25A10 transports malate and succinate from the
mitochondria across the mitochondrial inner membrane.
In the mitochondria malate and succinate are converted to
oxaloacetate, which is further transformed into aspartate
by an addition of an amino radical supplied by glutamate.
To investigate the glutamine dependency of the cells
glutamine deprivation experiments were performed at two
cell densities since cells have different growth properties
at different growth stages: active proliferating cells and
confluent cells. In proliferating cells, both siRNA-SLC
and untransfected or siRNA-CON cells were sensitive
to glutamine deprivation (Figure 2A). There was no
significant difference between these cell lines cultured
in medium without glutamine and pyruvate. For the
confluent cells, reducing the expression of the carrier
led to increased sensitivity to glutamine deprivation
(Figure 2B). While confluent untransfected and siRNACON cells were resistant to glutamine withdrawal,
confluent siRNA-SLC cells were sensitive to glutamine
deprivation. Pyruvate could partially rescue both the
actively proliferating and the confluent cells. These
results were also confirmed with other A549 SLC25A10
knockdown cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1) and
Hela SLC25A10 knockdown cell lines (Supplementary
Figure S2 A and S2 B).

RESULTS
Establishment and characterization of a stable
SLC25A10 knockdown cell line
Stable knockdown A549 NSCLC cell lines (siRNASLC −2, −4 and −5) with more than 75% reduction of
SLC25A10 mRNA were established (Figure 1A). The
SLC25A10 protein levels decreased by 73%, 80% and
37% in siRNA-SLC −2, −4 and −5 compared to the
siRNA-CON and untransfected cells (Figure 1B). The
down-regulation of SLC25A10 did not affect the doubling
time of both cell types, however, after reaching confluency
the siRNA-CON cells had a higher proliferation rate than
the siRNA-SLC cells (Figure 1C). The siRNA-SLC cells
grew in a monolayer manner and displayed decreased
ability to form cell islands compared to untransfected
A549 or siRNA-CON cells (Figure 1D). Moreover, the
size of the siRNA-SLC cells was smaller than the size
of the siRNA-CON cells (Figure 1D). Since siRNA-SLC
cells grew in an even monolayer, soft agar experiments
were performed to compare the ability of anchorageindependent growth of SLC25A10 knockdown cells
with untransfected and mock control cells. The sizes of
colonies from siRNA-SLC were small compared to the
colonies formed by untransfected or siRNA-CON cells
(Figure 1E) and in addition the number of colonies formed
by the siRNA-SLC cells were significantly lower than in
untransfected or siRNA-CON cells (Figure 1F).
The role of SLC25A10 for maintaining
mitochondrial morphology was investigated. MitoTracker

NADPH levels and ROS production in
siRNA-SLC cells
To understand the mechanisms underlying the
phenotype of siRNA-SLC cells, the NADPH levels were
determined in dividing and confluent cells grown in
complete media and in confluent cells also after 4 days
of glutamine starvation. Interestingly, the total NADP
increased by 20% in siRNA-SLC cells compared to
siRNA-CON cells in both dividing and resting cells (Figure
3A). A slight decrease of NADPH in dividing siRNA-SLC
cells and a slight increase of NADPH in resting siRNASLC cells (Figure 3B) resulted in a significant difference
of the ratio of NADPH/total NADP in dividing cells
although in resting cells the ratio between NADPH and

total NADP was not altered between siRNA-SLC and
siRNA-CON cells (Figure 3C). In cells grown without
glutamine the difference between siRNA-SLC cells and
siRNA-CON cells was pronounced. Both the amount
of total NADP (Figure 3A) and NADPH (Figure 3B)
were significantly decreased in the siRNA-SLC cells.
Next, we measured the ROS levels in dividing and
confluent cells. There was no difference in the level of
ROS in untreated proliferating siRNA-SLC and siRNACON cells (Figure 4A). Confluent siRNA-SLC cells had
significantly lower basal ROS level compared to siRNACON cells (Figure 4B). However, the proliferating and
confluent siRNA-SLC cells responded differently to
H2O2 challenges. The proliferating siRNA-SLC cells
produced lower amounts of ROS than the siRNA-CON

cells (Figure 4A), while the confluent siRNA-SLC cells
produced significantly higher amounts of ROS (p < 0.01)
than the confluent siRNA-CON cells (Figure 4B).
The thioredoxin system and the glutathione
system are two of the major antioxidant systems in the
mitochondrial matrix. To study if these systems were
involved in regulation of the redox homeostasis linked to
down-regulation of SLC25A10, the mRNA expression of
glutathione synthase (GSS), glutathione reductase (GSR),
thioredoxin 1 (TXN), thioredoxin 2 (TXN2) and the
corresponding thioredoxin reductases 1 and 2 (TXNRD1
and TXNRD2) were analyzed with real-time PCR. The
results showed that the gene expression of TXN2 and
TXNRD2 were significantly decreased in proliferating
siRNA-SLC cells compared to siRNA-CON cells

(p < 0.01) (Figure 4C). In confluent siRNA-SLC cells the
gene expression of TXN2 was also significantly downregulated (p < 0.01), but the gene expression of TXNRD2
was unaltered (Figure 4D). While TXN and TXNRD1 were
not changed in proliferating siRNA-SLC cells, the genes
were significantly up-regulated in confluent siRNA-SLC
cells (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01 respectively) (Figure 4D).
No statistically significant difference was detected in the
GSS and GSR gene expression between siRNA-SLC and
siRNA-CON cells in neither proliferating nor confluent
phases (Figure 4C and 4D).

gene expression of lactate dehydrogenase A and B (LDHA
and LDHB) were decreased (p < 0.01) (Figure 5C and 5D).
The transcript levels of pyruvate dehydrogenase A
(PDHA1) were increased in proliferating siRNA-SLC
cells (p < 0.01) (Figure 5E) but were similar in confluent
siRNA-CON and siRNA-SLC cells (Figure 5F). However,
the levels of the phosphorylated form of the pyruvate
dehydrogenase protein was found to be decreased by
30–60% in confluent siRNA-SLC cells, when analyzed
using a specific antibody against the phosphorylated site
(ser 293) (Figure 5G).
To further explore signaling pathways that could be
affected by down-regulation of SLC25A10 the p53 protein
expression was analyzed. Western blot showed that the p53
protein level was not significantly changed in siRNA-SLC
cells compared to siRNA-CON cells, whereas the level
of the p53 downstream target protein p21 was decreased
in the siRNA-SLC cells (Figure 6A). To investigate if
the down-regulation of p21 was linked to mitochondrial
TCA intermediate disturbances caused by the SLC25A10
knockdown, untransfected A549 cells were treated with
media with or without glutamine or pyruvate. The p53
levels did not change in samples from cultures with
glutamine, but decreased slightly in samples from cultures

Changes in expression levels of metabolic
regulatory enzymes
Since SLC25A10 mainly transports dicarboxylates,
genes involved in energy metabolism were also
investigated. In dividing cells, the gene expression
of glutamate dehydrogenase 2 (GLUD2) and lactate
dehydrogenase A (LDHA) were significantly increased
in siRNA-SLC cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 5A and 5B). In
confluent cells, the gene expression of both glutamate
dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (GLUD1 and GLUD2) were also
increased in siRNA-SLC cells (p < 0.01), whereas the

without glutamine and pyruvate (Figure 6B). Interestingly,
the gene expression levels of p21 also slightly decreased
in samples cultured without both glutamine and pyruvate
(40–50%) (Figure 6B). The down-regulation of the p21
protein level occurred post-translationally, since the
mRNA level was not changed (Figure 6C). Protein levels
of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α), a key regulator of
glycolysis in tumor cells, were also measured and showed
to be decreased by 40% in siRNA-SLC cells (Figure 6D).
In addition, the effect of the anticancer drug cisplatin on
p21 expression was investigated. Both p53 and p21 were
up-regulated upon cisplatin treatment (Figure 6E).

DISCUSSION
Metabolic modulation of cancer cells, as a way
of therapeutically eliminate them, is of great interest in
the field of cancer research. This work suggests that the
mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10 is of importance for the
properties that characterize cancer cells and hypothetically
could be used as a target for that kind of regulation. In
particular, our data show that confluent A549 cells
with down-regulated SLC25A10 have altered growth
behavior and decreased ability to respond to oxidative
stress, especially in resting cells. This change of redox
homeostasis was linked to an energy metabolic shift from
glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
In line with our findings is a recent study in which the
SLC25A10 carrier was shown to be linked to ROS

Increased sensitivity to the anti-cancer drug
cisplatin
Finally, to investigate the significance of SLC25A10
for the activity of anti-cancer compounds, the sensitivity
of cisplatin and 2’, 2-difluoro-deoxycytidine (dFdC) were
determined (Table 1). The siRNA-SLC cells had lower

production in that SLC25A10 was one of the target genes
of the BACH1 transcription factor [17]. BACH1 is a
heme-binding transcription factor and its target genes are
involved in oxidative stress response and in control of
the cell cycle. The substrates of the SLC25A10 carrier,
malate and succinate, are linked to NADPH synthesis
and regulation of cell metabolism, respectively. Malate is
the substrate for the cytosolic malic enzyme to produce
NADPH [16, 18], and succinate can directly activate prolyl
hydroxylases causing subsequent specific degradation
of HIF-1α [19]. In addition, SLA25A10 as well as the
oxoglutarate carrier (SLC25A11) are responsible for the
import of GSH into the mitochondrial matrix [20]. Since
NADPH/NADP+ is the principal redox couple involved
in intracellular ROS balance and GSH is one of the main
antioxidants in the cell, it is expected that the SLC25A10
carrier is important to maintain the redox status, especially
in resting cells.
Our data indicate that disturbance of SLC25A10
expression gives rise to vulnerability to glutamine
deprivation in confluent cells and impairs the anchorage
independent cell growth. We speculate that confluent
SLC25A10 knockdown cells need glutamine to substitute
for the lack of malate from the TCA cycle to produce
α-ketoglutarate to be exported to the cytoplasm and
there converted to oxaloacetate catalyzed by aspartate
aminotransferase and further to malate by malate
dehydrogenase (NADP+) for sufficient NADPH
production. The increased dependency of glutamine was
illustrated by an increased level of glutamate dehydrogenase
in SLC25A10 knockdown cells. The SLC25A10 knockdown
cells were also more sensitive to the anti-cancer drug
cisplatin, but not to the nucleoside analog dFdC. Although
the mechanism of cisplatin cytotoxicity is complex,
cisplatin has been demonstrated to be able to redirect
cancer cells from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation
[21]. The anti-cancer effect of cisplatin was shown to be
linked to oxidative stress of tumor cells and an increased
level of HIF-1α has been shown to contribute to cisplatin
resistance in tumor cells [22, 23]. The nucleoside analogue
dFdC is active through incorporation into genomic DNA
and thereby the anti-cancer effect is correlated to the rate
of DNA replication. Since the knockdown cells had similar
growth pattern as mock control cells, the sensitivity to
dFdC was not expected to be altered, as was also shown by
the results obtained.
The observed cell growth changes can be explained
by the altered NADPH production identified in our study.
As referred before, NADPH is one of the most important
reducing equivalents for both macromolecule synthesis
and for scavenging ROS. Cancer cells usually have
higher levels of intracellular ROS than normal cells and
the relatively high level of ROS in cancer cells may have
several effects [24]. To maintain the redox homeostasis
and be adjustable to combat oxidative stress are features
of special importance for the survival of cancer cells.

Metabolism studies with labeled glucose and glutamine
have shown that the majority of glucose molecules in
proliferating cells were directed into the PPP pathway
to produce NADPH and that glutamine was used to
replenish mitochondrial TCA intermediates [16]. Other
pathways that also can provide NADPH include the
methylene tetrahydrofolate dehydrogenases and the malic
enzyme pathways. The cytosolic malic enzyme has been
predicted to account for nearly 30% of cytosolic NADPH
production in dividing cells. Therefore, blocking malate
transport might have a more profound effect on NADPH
production in resting cells than in dividing cells, especially
under stress when the demand of NADPH increase and
PPP pathway is down-regulated. Interestingly, our study
showed that inhibition of SLC25A10 led to increased
total intracellular NADP levels but with minor effects on
NADPH levels. That the SLC25A10 knockdown cells were
deficient in NADPH production was clearly demonstrated
by growing the cells in medium without glutamine. We
speculate that, although the malate pathway was blocked,
the SLC25A10 knockdown cells grown in normal medium
sustained their NADPH levels through a metabolic shift,
with increased conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. This
was supported by the increased gene expression level of
pyruvate dehydrogenase and decreased inactive form of
phosphorylated pyruvate dehydrogenase in the SLC25A10
knockdown cells. In further support of our hypothesis we
showed that supplement of pyruvate could partially rescue
cells in medium without glutamine. Consistent with our
hypotheisis, we found that HIF-1α was down-regulated
and the ROS levels were decreased both in dividing
and resting siRNA-SLC cells grown without nutrient
limitation. However, upon oxidative stress induced by
H2O2, dividing siRNA-SLC cells produced less ROS than
control cells, while the confluent cells had considerably
higher ROS levels in comparison to the control cells.
We observed interesting differences in the need for
fully active SLC25A10 between proliferating cells and
confluent cells. The confluent siRNA-SLC cells were
more vulnerable to oxidative stress induced by H2O2 and
to glutamine deprivation than the control cells. Our data
showed that the thioredoxin redox system was involved
in the process to maintain the redox balance in SLC25A10
knockdown cells. Although TXN2 expression decreased in
both dividing and confluent cells, the TXN and TXNRD1
genes were up-regulated only in resting cells. Thioredoxin
2 is a small redox protein localized in the mitochondria
and plays an important role in the regulation of the
mitochondrial membrane potential and protection against
oxidant-induced apoptosis. Consistent down-regulation of
the TXN2 gene expression indicated that SLC25A10 was
involved in regulating the mitochondrial redox homeostasis.
The increased gene expression levels of TXN (the cytosolic
form of thioredoxin) and the TXNRD1 only in resting cells
further confirmed the important role of SLC25A10 for
maintaining redox homeostasis in confluent cells.

vector and transfected into A549 cells with Fugene 6
HD kit (Promega) (Madison, WI). Stable expression
cells were selected with puromycin at 1000 μg/ml,
and maintained at 200 μg/ml. The SLC25A10 knockdown clones were screened with real-time PCR (Kapa
Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) and the protein expression
levels were determine with specific antibody. The clones
used for different experiments are indicated in the figures.
The growth curves of mock control (siRNA-CON)
and SLC25A10 knockdown (siRNA-SLC) cells were
performed by seeding 1.5 × 105 cells in 6-well plates, and
cell numbers were counted in triplicate every 3 days for
18 days.

The gene expression profile of key metabolic
enzymes and the decrease of the HIF-1α protein level
in siRNA-SLC cells suggested a metabolic shift from
glycolysis to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.
Although the tumor suppressor p53 expression did not
change, the gene expression of its down-stream target p21
decreased. To confirm the involvement of p21 in energy
metabolism, we grew untransfected A549 cells in different
media conditions with or without pyruvate and glutamine;
p21 was only down-regulated in cells growing without both
glutamine and pyruvate. Although glutamine deprivation
and cisplatin can lead to cell grow arrest, cisplatin is able to
induce both, p53 and p21 expression. These results indicate
that tumor cells repond to different stress in different
ways and also reveal the importance of further studies to
investigate the role of p21 in energy metabolism.
In conclusion, our study demonstrates that
SLC25A10 is an important carrier in regulating redox
homeostasis, especially in resting cells. Inhibition of
SLC25A10 expression can be a strategy to reprogram cell
metabolism, compromise cell growth and increase the
sensitivity to traditional anticancer drugs such as cisplatin.
We suggest SLC25A10 as a novel target to be exploited in
the ongoing challenge to combat cancer.

cells, 3 × 105 cells were placed in 3.5 mm dishes, collected
cells 4 days after they reached confluency. For glutamine
deprivated cells, 3 × 105 cells were placed in 3.5 mm
dishes, when cell reached confluency, the complete medium
was replaced with glutamine free medium and continue
culture for 4 days. Total NADPt and NADPH levels
were analyzed with NADP/NADPH assay kit according

SLC25A10 specific siRNA (siRNA-SLC) and mock
control siRNA (siRNA-CON) expression plasmids were
prepared as described by the manufacturer. Briefly, two
specific oligonucleotides were designed using online
tools BLOCK-iTTM RNAi designer (http://rnaidesigner.
lifetechnologies.com/rnaiexpress/). The siRNA target
sequence is 5’-GGATGCAGAACGACGTGAA-3’. The
two complimentary oligonucleotides were annealed and

to the manufacturer’s instruction (Abcam, Cambridge,
UK). Total intracellular ROS level was measured as
described using 2, 7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate
(CM-H2DCFDA) (Molecular Probes, Carlsbad, CA)
as a probe. Briefly 1 × 104 cells were seeded in 96-well
plate in DMEM medium. 24 h after plating, the cells were
washed twice with HBSS (PBS supplemented with 1.2
mM CaCl2 and 10 mM glucose) and incubated with CMH2DCFDA at final concentration at 10 μM. After 30 min
at 37°C, the cells were washed again with HBSS twice and
incubated with H2O2 at 100 μM and HBSS as control for
15 min respectively. The fluorescence was measured by
using micro plate fluorimeter with excitation at 495 nm
and emission at 530 nm (Varioskan Flash, Thermo Electron
Corporation, Waltham, MA).

2 × 104 cells per ml were seeded in 200 μl per
well in 96-well micro titer plates in the presence
of serial dilutions of the test compounds, 2’, 2’,
-difluorodeoxycytidine (dFdC) (Eli Lilly, Indianapolis,
IN), and cisplatin (Accord Healthcare, Middlesex, UK).
The cells were allowed to proliferate for 48 h before fresh
drugs were added. Cell survival was assayed by XTT
method after 96 h of drug exposure. The data is presented
as the inhibitory concentration (IC50), which is defined
as the concentration of a drug that is required to inhibit
cell proliferation by 50% in vitro. Each experiment was
performed 3 times.

Protein levels of SLC25A10, PDH, p53, p21 and
HIF-1α in siRNA-SLC cells analyzed by
western blot

Sensitivity to glutamine deprivation
experiments

To measure the SLC25A10, PDH, p53, p21 and
HIF-1α protein levels in siRNA-SLC cells, the confluent
siRNA-SLC and siRNA-CON cells were harvested and
washed with PBS and lyzed in radioimmune precipitation
assay buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mM
NaCl, 1% Nonidet P40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate,
0.1% SDS, and protease inhibitors). Western blot was
performed using 4–12% precast Bis-Tris gel (NuPAGE)
and Amersham Biosciences Hybond-P membrane (GE
Healthcare, Pittsburgh). Phosphorylated form of pyruvate
dehydrogenase, p53, p21, HIF-1α protein levels were
measured with specific primary antibodies, and voltagedependent anion channel (VDAC) or β-actin was used
as loading controls. To determine p53 and p21 protein
level changes in different conditioned media, 1.5 × 106
untransfected A549 cells were seeded in 10 mm dishes,
after 24 h the medium were replaced with different media
as indicated in the legend. The cells were collected after
24 h for Western blot analysis. For cisplatin treatments,
1.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 10 mm dishes in complete
DMEM medium, cisplatin was added to the cells at
concentration of 10 μM. The cells were cultured for 24 h,
and then collected for Western blot as above. The protein
expression levels were quantified with Image Studio Lite
software (LI-COR Biosciences).

Untransfected, siRNA-CON and siRNA-SLC-2
cells were seeded in 96-well plates at two densities (5 ×
103 and 1.5 × 104 cells per well respectively) in 100 μl of
complete DMEM medium. After 24 h, the medium from
5 × 103-cell wells was replaced with 100 μl of different
conditioned media: complete DMEM, complete DMEM
without glutamine, complete DMEM without pyruvate,
complete DMEM without pyruvate and glutamine. For the
5 × 104-cell wells, the medium was replaced with different
conditioned media as above after 48 h when the cells
reached confluency. All media were supplemented with
10% dialyzed FBS and 1% penicillin and streptomycin.
The media were replaced every 3 days. Cell viability was
determined with Cell Proliferation Kit II (Roche Life
Science, Mannhein, Germany). Briefly, 50 μl of XTT
labeling reagent and 1 μl of electron coupling reagent was
mixed and 50 μl of mixture was added into each well and
the plate was incubated in a humidified atmosphere for
3 h, the absorbance was then measured using an ELISA
reader (Infinite® M200, Tecan trading AG, Männedorf,
Switzerland) at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at
650 nm. The experiments were repeated 3 times. The
experiment was also performed with SLC25A10 knockdown Hela cells.

Soft agar colony assay

Statistics

Untransfected, siRNA-CON and siRNA-SLC-2
cells were suspended in 0.35% agarose and DMEM
supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin and
streptomycin, and seeded over a basal layer of 0.5%
agarose. The experiments were set up in 6-well plates at
cell density at 5 × 103 cells per well in triplicate. After 4
weeks of culture at 37°C, 5% CO2, plates were stained
with 0.01% crystal violet for 1 h, and colonies were scored
manually from 3 wells for each cell type.

Two-tailed, unpaired Student’s t-test was used to test
for statistical significance of difference in mean values.
Significance was set at p < 0.05.
