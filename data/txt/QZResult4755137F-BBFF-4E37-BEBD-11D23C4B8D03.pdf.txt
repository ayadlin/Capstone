BACKGROUND: The objective of the current prospective, multicenter, international study was to trace the incidence and severity of
acute oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy (OXLIPN) and to determine its clinical pattern. The authors also specifically tested
whether patients who had more symptoms of acute OXLIPN eventually would develop a more severe chronic, cumulative form of
OXLIPN. METHODS: One hundred seventy patients (mean  standard deviation age, 63.7  8.7 years) who were scheduled to receive
either combined leucovorin, 5-fluoruracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or combined capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) for metastatic
colorectal cancer were monitored prospectively at baseline and were followed in 4 European sites. The incidence of hyperexcitability
symptoms secondary to acute OXLIPN was assessed by using a descriptive questionnaire (yes/no question) at each clinical evaluation. Motor and neurosensory criteria according to version 3 of the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria were applied
to clinically grade the severity of OXLIPN. RESULTS: Acute OXLIPN was present in 146 of 170 patients (85.9%). The vast majority of
these patients manifested cold-induced perioral (95.2%) or pharyngolaryngeal (91.8%) dysesthesias. Severe acute OXLIPN that
required prolongation of oxaliplatin infusion from 2 hours to 4 to 6 hours occurred in 32 of 146 patients (21.9%). The increased number of acute OXLIPN symptoms was correlated significantly (Spearman rho correlation coefficient [r]) with both the development
(r ¼ 0.602; P < .001) and the degree of the chronic, cumulative form (r ¼ 0.702; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that the vast majority of patients with colorectal cancer who receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy will manifest symptoms of a
transient acute syndrome soon after oxaliplatin administration. Patients who have a more complex combination of acute phenomena
related to axonal hyperexcitability are those who eventually develop more severe OXLIPN. Therefore, it may be advisable to test agents

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents the third most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related
deaths in the Western world.1 Therapeutic management of CRC is challenging and depends on the disease stage at diagnosis. Current knowledge indicates that oxaliplatin (OXL)-based combination regimens, in the form of either combined
leucovorin, 5-fluoruracil, and OXL (FOLFOX) or combined capecitabine and OXL (XELOX), have demonstrated substantial cytotoxic synergy in the adjuvant setting and in the advanced or metastatic setting and, thus, are associated with
prolonged disease progression-free and overall survival.2
However, peripheral neuropathy is currently recognized as 1 of the major nonhematologic toxicities of OXL with a
possible negative impact on therapeutic outcomes, thus compromising survival and also negatively influencing patients’
quality of life.3 OXL induces 2 clinically distinct forms of peripheral neuropathy; the neuromyotonia-like, acute, transient
syndrome characterized by cold-induced distal or perioral paresthesias and pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesias and the chronic
form that, in most cases, is a pure sensory, axonal neuropathy with a stocking-and-glove distribution.4
In clinical practice, to date, less attention is usually drawn to the acute form of OXL-induced peripheral neuropathy
(OXLIPN) than to the chronic form. This is because the acute hyperexcitability syndrome is transient: It usually is reversible within hours or days and, in the vast majority of patients, does not require discontinuation of treatment or dose

persist for a long time, even after patients discontinue
OXL.6
In light of recent evidence suggesting that the degree
of acute nerve dysfunction may relate to the development
of chronic neurotoxicity,7 the objective of our current
study was to prospectively trace the incidence and severity
of acute OXLIPN and to analyze its clinical pattern.
Moreover, we specifically aimed at testing whether the
degree of acute OXLIPN is related in some way to the development and severity of cumulative OXLIPN at the end
of chemotherapy. The detailed monitoring of chronic
OXLIPN was not included among the objectives of the
current study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

This was a prospective, multicenter, international, collaborative study among experienced neurologists and oncologists at 4 sites in 3 European countries. The study
protocol was approved by the corresponding institutional
review boards of each site, and written informed consent
was obtained from all patients before study entry.
Patient Selection

The study sample was recruited during an 18-month period. Patients who were included had a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic CRC and were scheduled
to receive OXL-based chemotherapy with either FOLFOX or XELOX. To be eligible for enrollment, patients
had to be aged >18 years and had to have satisfactory liver
and renal function, to have a life expectancy 9 months,
to have a Karnofsky performance score 70, and to be
able to fully understand the study information provided
by the investigators. Patients also were required to be neurotoxic chemotherapy-naive and to be scheduled to
receive adjuvant or first-line treatment. Patients with history of peripheral neuropathy and those with concomitant
diseases (eg, diabetes, renal insufficiency, alcohol abuse
[>5 IU daily]) that would interfere or complicate the clinical assessments were excluded.
Two hundred twenty-four patients initially were
screened, and 170 eventually were included in the study.
During screening, 54 patients were excluded for various
reasons, including evidence of pre-existing neuropathy
(n ¼ 23), a change in treatment plan requiring the receipt
of a chemotherapy regimen other than FOLFOX or
XELOX (n ¼ 12), the presence of conditions that would
have complicated accurate assessment (n ¼ 11), refusal

(n ¼ 6), and other reasons (n ¼ 2). All included patients
were evaluated clinically at baseline (Visit 1), which
occurred at the time of the screening visit or up to 2 days
after administration of the first chemotherapy course.
Outcome Measures

The incidence and severity of cumulative OXLIPN was
graded by using version 3 of the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria (NCI-CTC v3) for sensory and motor neuropathy. In fact, this scale is
considered the standard method for assessing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), and it grades
the severity of CIPN from 0 (no toxicity) to 4 (most severe
grade of CIPN).8
The frequency of the 11 most common hyperexcitability symptoms associated with acute OXLIPN,3
including cold-induced perioral paresthesias, coldinduced pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesia, shortness of
breath, difficulty swallowing, laryngospasm, muscle
cramps, jaw stiffness, fasciculations, voice changes, ptosis,
and ocular changes, were assessed by a descriptive questionnaire (yes/no response format). The severity of acute
OXLIPN was scored based on the number of symptoms
reported by patients at each clinical assessment. An
increase in the number of acute symptoms was considered
suggestive of an increase in the severity of acute OXLIPN.
In addition, severe acute neurotoxicity that required dose
reduction and potentially subsequent treatment discontinuation was considered only in patients who had acute
neurotoxicity lasting >2 weeks, even without motor
symptoms or neurologic signs.5 Patients were asked about
acute and chronic symptoms in the same encounter and
by the same researcher.
Finally, conventional motor and sensory nerve-conduction studies at the ulnar, radial, peroneal, and sural
nerves were carried out unilaterally on the nondominant
side using widely accepted criteria for the identification of
abnormalities.9 All of the aforementioned clinical and
neurophysiologic evaluations were performed at baseline
and were repeated after 6 courses (OXL planned dose,
510 mg/m2) and 12 courses (OXL planned dose, 1020
mg/m2) of the FOLFOX regimens and after 4 courses
(OXL dose, 520 mg/m2) and 8 courses (OXL dose, 1040
mg/m2) of the XELOX regimen.
Chemotherapy Regimen and Dose Modification

The formal FOLFOX-4 regimen10 was administered to
the majority of our patients (n ¼ 88; 51.8%), consisting
of leucovorin (LV) 200 mg/m2 as a 2-hour infusion on
days 1 and 2 followed by 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m2 on
days 1 and 2 as an intravenously bolus. Then, 5439

fluorouracil 600 mg/m2 was administered as a 22-hour
infusion on days 1 and 2. OXL 85 mg/m2 was given as a
2-hour intravenously infusion concurrent with leucovorin
on day 1. Therapy was repeated every 2 weeks. Routine
antiemetic prophylaxis also was prescribed. Nine patients
(5.3%) received FOLFOX-6, and 73 patients (42.9%)
received XELOX, consisting of intravenous OXL 130
mg/m2 on day 1 followed by oral capecitabine 1000 mg/
m2 twice daily (from the evening of day 1 to the morning
of day 15) every 3 weeks.11
Dose adjustments of the study drugs or treatment
delays were calculated according to toxicity grade. Dose
modifications were determined according to the greatest
degree of toxicity. Toxicities were graded using NCICTC v3. The OXL dose was reduced by 30% for persistent or temporary (at least 14 days) painful paresthesia,
dysesthesia, or functional impairment. If, despite the 30%
dose reduction of OXL, the grade 3 neurotoxicity persisted, then chemotherapy was omitted in subsequent
cycles. No prophylactic or symptomatic treatment was
given for neurotoxicity during the administration of
chemotherapy. Patients with any grade 4 toxicity, except
gastrointestinal or hematologic toxicity, had to be withdrawn from the study.

the incidence and degree of chronic OXLIPN was examined with the Spearman rho correlation coefficient (r). All
tests were 2-sided, and significance was set at P < .05.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS for

RESULTS
The demographics and clinical characteristics of the
patients are presented in Table 1.
Acute Oxaliplatin-Induced Peripheral
Neuropathy Incidence

Acute OXLIPN was present in 146 of 170 patients
(85.9%). The vast majority of patients manifested coldinduced perioral (95.2%) or pharyngolaryngeal (91.8%)
dysesthesias. Table 2 summarizes the incidence of acute
neurotoxic effects secondary to the receipt of OXL.
Acute Oxaliplatin-Induced Peripheral
Neuropathy Severity

The median number of symptoms that patients with acute
neurotoxicity reported was 4 symptoms (range, 1-7 symptoms). According to the total number of OXLIPN symptoms, the severity of OXLIPN at the final follow-up was
grade 1 in 49 of 146 patients (33.6%), grade 2 in 41 of
146 patients (28.1%), and grade 3 in 56 of 146 patients
(38.4%). The majority of patients (90 of 146; 61.7%)
started developing acute OXLIPN between Courses 0 and
6 of FOLFOX (median cumulative OXL dose at Course
6, 888 mg) and between Courses 0 and 4 of XELOX (median cumulative dose at Course 4, 880 mg), whereas fewer
patients (n ¼ 56; 38.4%) developed acute neurotoxic
effects between Courses 6 and 12 of FOLFOX (median
cumulative final OXL dose at Course 12, 1653 mg) and
between Courses 4 and 8 of XELOX (median cumulative
final OXL dose at Course 8, 1634 mg).

and the box plot in b indicates that the increased number of acute OXLIPN symptoms also is correlated significantly with the severity of the chronic form. Nbacute indicates the number of acute symptoms reported by patients; Overchrtox, the overall incidence of chronic OXLIPN; Oversevncictc, the severity of OXLIPN graded according to NCI-CTC v3 criteria.

In total, 146 of 170 patients (85.9%) developed
acute OXLIPN, and 123 of 170 patients (72.4%) also
eventually manifested various degrees of chronic, cumulative OXLIPN, as measured according to NCI-CTC v3
neurosensory criteria. Twenty-three patients with acute
OXLIPN did not developed cumulative neurotoxicity as
assessed at the end of treatment. The clinical and demographic data in these patients did not differ from those in
the patients who developed both acute and chronic
OXLIPN. This subgroup of patients included 11 men
and 12 women with mean age (standard deviation) of
64.8  7.1 years (range, 51-76 years). Ten of these
patients received FOLFOX, and 13 received XELOX.
OXL was given as a 2-hours infusion at a median
(standard deviation) dose per single course of 171  41
mg (range, 80-250 mg) and at a median cumulative dose
of 1491  330 mg (range, 940-2000 mg). The only characteristic of this subgroup was that 20 of 23 of patients
(87%) developed mild, transient, grade 1 acute neuropathy, whereas the other 3 patients manifested grade 2 acute
neuropathy. The median number of acute symptoms they
reported was 2 (range, 1-3 symptoms) compared with a
median of 4 symptoms (range, 1-7 symptoms) reported
for all patients who manifested any grade of acute and
chronic neurotoxicity. Twenty-four patients did not develop either acute or chronic OXLIPN. The characteristics of this subgroup were similar compared with those of
Cancer

the patients who manifested either the acute form alone or
both acute and chronic OXLIPN.
Severe acute OXLIPN that required prolongation of
OXL infusion from 2 hours to 4 to 6 hours was evident in
32 of 146 patients (21.9%). Prolongation of OXL infusion occurred after 2 courses in 7 of 32 patients (4.8%),
after 3 courses in 2 of 32 patients (1.4%), after 4 courses
in 8 of 32 patients (5.5%), after 5 courses in 6 of 32
patients (4.8%), and after 8 courses in 1 of 32 patient
(0.7%); whereas another patient who received FOLFOX
required prolongation of the OXL infusion after 8 courses
of chemotherapy. However, none of the enrolled patients
required dose reductions or discontinued treatment
because of persistent grade 3 acute neurotoxicity.

Associations

On the basis of data at last follow-up, the worst severity of
acute neurotoxicity was related to the cumulative OXL
dose (Spearman rho [r] ¼ 0.171; P ¼ .026). Associations
between the severity of acute OXLIPN and demographic
data, such as age and sex, failed to reach significance. The
increased number of acute OXLIPN symptoms, suggesting an increased severity of acute OXLIPN, was correlated
significantly with both the development (r ¼ 0.602; P <
.001) and degree (r ¼ 0.702; P < .001) of the chronic
form (Fig. 1a,b).

Original Article

However, based on data from the intermediate follow-up, the cumulative OXL dose was associated only
with the development of chronic, cumulative neurotoxicity (r ¼ 0.216; P ¼ .005), but not with the acute syndrome (r ¼ 0.097; P ¼ .210). At the same time point,
significant correlations emerged between the overall severity of acute OXLIPN with both the development (r ¼
0.513; P < .001) and the degree (r ¼ 0.482; P < .001) of
chronic, cumulative neurotoxicity at the end of
chemotherapy.
Neurophysiologic monitoring revealed a significant
longitudinal deterioration (from baseline to subsequent
scores; ie, intermediate and final follow-up) in the amplitude of sensory action potentials of all 3 sensory nerves
tested. The same comparison between motor-conduction
variables failed to reach significance in both treatment
groups. These abnormalities were in keeping with an axonal, sensory polyneuropathy and were linked to the
chronic OXLIPN, because they were considered unrelated
to the hyperexcitability acute syndrome secondary to
OXL administration.
DISCUSSION
OXL, a third-generation organoplatinum compound, is
capable of inducing 2 clinically distinct forms of peripheral neuropathy—acute and chronic—through mechanisms that have yet to be clearly defined.3 It is believed
that the acute form is caused by a dysfunction of nodal
axonal voltage-gated sodium channels, probably the calcium-dependent channels. In particular, the rapid chelation of calcium by OXL-induced oxalate and the
subsequent alteration in voltage-gated sodium channel
kinetics (reduction of the overall sodium current)
may be the main response that generates the acute
syndrome.12,13
Conversely, the accumulation of OXL in dorsal root
ganglia (DRG) cells may induce chronic neurotoxicity by
damaging the DRG sensory neurons with axoplasmatic
transport changes secondary to cell body damage.14 Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress also may contribute significantly to OXL-induced neuronal
apoptosis.13
To date, research has been focused mainly on
chronic OXLIPN, because it is often dose-limiting and
long lasting.15 Therefore, the chronic form is considered
to have more clinical relevance than the acute syndrome,
which usually is reversible and, in most cases, apart from
prolonging OXL infusion, does not require dose modification or treatment discontinuation.16 However, because
it has been suggested that acute neurotoxicity is related to
442

the onset and severity of chronic OXLPN,7 our objective
was to analyze its frequency and features in a large, homogeneous cohort of patients.
In the current setting, the reported rate of patients
who manifested acute (85.9%) and chronic (72.4%)
OXLIPN after either FOLFOX or XELOX was quite similar to that previously reported.17,18 The symptoms of
acute toxicity are different from those of chronic toxicity.
In addition, neurophysiology can distinguish the nature
of symptoms (acute or chronic syndrome); thus, based on
clinical examinations and neurophysiology, we were able
to clearly differentiate symptoms of persistent acute neuropathy and symptoms that suggested the onset of chronic
neuropathy.
In line with previous publications,17,19 the majority of
our patients experienced acute hyperexcitability symptoms
that resembled disorders of voltage-gated ion channels.20
Most of our patients manifested cold-induced perioral
(95.2%) or pharyngolaryngeal dysesthesias (91.8%), as outlined in Table 2. Results from an experimental study have
suggested that cooling in the presence of OXL strongly
mediates bursts of action potentials in myelinated A fibers of
human and mouse peripheral axons and large-diameter
DRG neurons, thus resulting in cold-induced hyperexcitability phenomena.21 In addition, there is evidence that cold
exposure is able to further affect sodium channel kinetics,
thus predisposing to ectopic activity.20
Fewer patients presented with other uncommon
symptoms,7,10 such as jaw spasm, difficulty swallowing,
slurred speech, ocular changes, and calf cramps with walking that tended to persist for days. The occurrence of such
symptoms may result from an acute, abnormal, OXLinduced hyperexcitability state of peripheral sensory and
motor nerves fibers, including those of the cranial
nerves.13,22
Neurophysiologic monitoring revealed progressive
deterioration in the amplitude of sensory action potentials, and this finding was linked to chronic neuropathy.
Generally, it is believed that sensory nerve amplitude
reduction is unlikely to be observed in acute OXL neuropathy. In support of this view are results from a previous
neurophysiologic study assessing nerve-conduction studies and findings on needle electromyography in patients
with metastatic CRC before and during treatment with
OXL. That study revealed that repetitive compound muscle action potentials and neuromyotonic discharges were
observed in the first 24 to 48 hours after OXL infusion
but resolved by 3 weeks; whereas a decline in the amplitude of sensory action potentials was observed only after 8
to 9 treatment cycles.19

Acute Oxaliplatin Neurotoxicity/Argyriou et al

Most patients manifested acute neurotoxic effects
without requiring prolongation of OXL infusion, whereas
dose reduction or treatment discontinuation was not
recorded. However, in the current study, a significant proportion of our patients (22%) required the infusion of
OXL over a period >2 hours because of the severity of
their acute OXLIPN. This rate is similar to the rate
observed in some previous studies,17 although it is lower
than that observed in other studies.23
The main finding of our study is that patients who
had more severe acute OXLIPN, as determined by the
number of symptoms reported by the patients, eventually
also develop a more severe, chronic OXLIPN, suggesting
that acute OXLIPN may predispose patients to the
chronic, cumulative form. This result also is supported by
the finding that 20 of 23 patients with acute OXLIPN
who did not eventually developed chronic neurotoxicity
experienced mild, transient, grade 1 hyperexcitability phenomena. These findings seem to be at odds with the different pathogenic mechanism of acute and chronic OXL
neurotoxicity, but they may simply express a different
individual, possibly genetic susceptibility to both acute
and/or chronic OXL neurotoxicity. In addition, it has
been demonstrated that patients who had alterations of
axonal excitability in early OXL treatment were more
prone to developing dose-limiting neurotoxicity, thus
demonstrating that the degree of acute nerve dysfunction
may relate to the development of chronic neurotoxicity.7
In support of our data, we have demonstrated that
the cumulative dose of OXL also was related to the severity of acute hyperexcitability syndrome. A possible pathogenic hypothesis is that, in addition to the decreased
cellular metabolism and axoplasmatic transport in DRG
cells, the prolonged activation of voltage-gated sodium
channels may induce cellular stress, further affecting the
sensory nerve cells and contributing to the development
of chronic OXLIPN.3
However, although this association may reflect the
pathogenic relevance of acute OXLIPN, it may simply
reflect the expression of a generic susceptibility to peripheral
nervous system disturbance in a given patient. Therefore,
further studies are needed to test whether neurophysiologic
axonal changes (signs of chronic peripheral nerve damage)
occur earlier in patients with acute OXLIPN versus those
without, thus supporting the possibility that acute OXLIPN
may be a predictor of chronic OXLIPN.
On clinical grounds, our results suggest that oncologists mostly should be alert and aware and should use prevention against the acute form of OXLIPN, because the
acute hyperexcitability syndrome may be a strong mediator

or predictor of OXL-induced chronic peripheral nerve damage. In the current setting, we did not adhere to NCI-CTC
v3 criteria for adverse events to grade the severity of acute
OXLIPN, because the severity of acute hyperexcitability
symptoms is difficult to measure, and cold-related symptoms are not addressed in common neurotoxicity scales.
Moreover, there is a lack of validated, specifically focused
scales on this issue. Therefore, we applied scores from the
scale, based on the sum of symptoms, reported by patients
at each clinical assessment. We do acknowledge that the use
of a nonvalidated measure to grade the severity of acute
OXLIPN represents a limitation of our study design. Nevertheless, we still believe it was the most appropriate approach
to assessing acute OXLIPN, because, to our knowledge,
there is no validated instrument that could be substituted.
This limitation aside, our study was a multicenter,
international study that reflected everyday clinical practice, and the results easily may be generalized and
extended to daily clinical practice. Also in support of this
view is our large sample size, probably the largest in the literature to be exclusively focused on acute OXLIPN in
patients with CRC, which was prospectively studied at 4
European sites by experienced neurologists and oncologists on the topic of chemotherapy-induced neuropathies
and supportive care in cancer.
To date, the ideal neuroprotective agent against
OXLIPN is lacking. Oxalate chelators, such as calciummagnesium infusion, may be effective in reducing the
incidence of acute OXLIPN, but it is still not clearly proven that they do not interfere with OXL antitumor efficacy. Alternatively, drugs capable of blocking the voltagegated ion channels deserve to be tested for their ability to
significantly reduce the occurrence of acute and (eventually) chronic OXLIPN. In particular, certain anticonvulsants, such as oxcarbazepine and carbamazepine, because
of their mode of action, may be able to target the central
and peripheral sensitization mechanisms involved in neuropathic pain syndromes, thereby reducing the hyperexcitability of damaged peripheral nerves and, as such,
interfering with the underlying mechanism involved in
the genesis of OXLIPN.24-26
To summarize, the current study demonstrates that
the vast majority of patients with CRC who receive OXLbased chemotherapy will manifest a transient, acute
hyperexcitability syndrome that may contribute to the development of chronic peripheral neuropathy. Appropriate
pharmacologic approaches to prevent the OXL-induced
acute hyperexcitability syndrome, thus, also may have a
positive effect on the chronic form of OXL-induced peripheral nerve damage.
