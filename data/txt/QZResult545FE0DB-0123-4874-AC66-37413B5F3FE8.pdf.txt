ABSTRACT
Proteins that promote epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) are associated
with cancer metastasis. Inhibition of EMT regulators may be a promising approach in
cancer therapy. In this study, Thymoquinone (TQ) was used to treat cancer cell lines
to investigate its effects on EMT-regulatory proteins and cancer metastasis. We show
that TQ inhibited cancer cell growth, migration and invasion in a dose-dependent
manner. At the molecular level, TQ treatment decreased the transcriptional activity
of the TWIST1 promoter and the mRNA expression of TWIST1, an EMT-promoting
transcription factor. Accordingly, TQ treatment also decreased the expression of
TWIST1-upregulated genes such as N-Cadherin and increased the expression of
TWIST1-repressed genes such as E-Cadherin, resulting in a reduction of cell migration
and invasion. TQ treatment also inhibited the growth and metastasis of cancer cellderived xenograft tumors in mice but partially attenuated the migration and invasion
in TWIST1-overexpressed cell lines. Furthermore, we found that TQ treatment
enhanced the promoter DNA methylation of the TWIST1 gene in BT 549 cells. Together,
these results demonstrate that TQ treatment inhibits TWIST1 promoter activity and
decreases its expression, leading to the inhibition of cancer cell migration, invasion
and metastasis. These findings suggest TQ as a potential small molecular inhibitor of
cancer growth and metastasis.

from clear understanding. Epithelial to mesenchymal
transitions (EMT) is a biological process, by which polarized
epithelial cells lose their adherence and tight cell–cell
junction, enhance migratory capacity, elevate resistance to
apoptosis, increase the production of extracellular matrix
(ECM) components and gain invasive properties to become
mesenchymal cells [1, 3]. Although EMT is a developmental
process, it has been utilized in the early stages of cancer to
promote invasive metastasis [3]. EMT allows the cancer cells
to acquire invasive properties and to develop migratory and
invasive characteristics. These events are facilitated by the
down-regulation of cell-cell adhesion molecule E-Cadherin,
up-regulation of more plastic mesenchymal proteins such as

INTRODUCTION
Cancer metastasis is the major characteristic of
malignant carcinomas and is common in late stage of cancer.
Cancer is one of the major threats of human health in modern
age, and metastasis is thought to be the principal cause of
death in cancer patients [1, 2]. Despite the great advances
of modern medical science in the last century, metastatic
tumors are not yet curable. This is partly because of the
complex mechanism of metastasis, and the difficulties in
developing efficient treatments. A number of physiological
and biochemical pathways is involved in the process of
metastasis, detailed mechanisms of which is still far away

N-Cadherin, Vimentin and smooth muscle actin, deregulation
of the Wnt pathway and break through the basement
membrane. The transcription factor TWIST1, along with
SNAIL1, SLUG and ZEB1, plays the major role in EMTassociated metastasis in cancer cells [3–6]. In addition to
the overexpression, epigenetic changes, especially promoter
methylation of TWIST1 gene, are also involved in cancer
metastasis [5, 7]. Controlling the expression of TWIST1 and
other EMT mediator proteins might be an interesting and
potential target in cancer therapeutics.
In traditional or alternative medicinal practices, drugs
from natural sources have been used for thousands of years,
such as Traditional Chinese Medicine. These natural products
are increasingly integrated into modern medical science. The
seeds of Nigella sativa (black cumin) have a notable place in
traditional medicines mainly in Arabian, South Asian, SouthEast Asian, Mediterranean and some African countries.
Ancient Egypt, Turkey, and Greece often used N. sativa seeds
to treat a myriad of diseases and ailments. N. sativa seeds are
often named ‘Prophetic medicine’, indicated by the Muslim
prophet as a highly potential medicine. Different extracts of
N. sativa or oils of its seeds possess medicinal properties,
and are well known for their anticancer, antihypertensive,
antidiabetic, immunomodulatory, analgesic, antimicrobial,
anti-inflammatory, spasmolytic, bronchodilative, hepatoprotective, renal-protective, gastro-protective and antioxidant
activities [8–10]. Biochemical studies have revealed that the
major active ingredient behind the medicinal properties of
N. sativa is Thymoquinone (TQ) [9].

The anticancer activity of TQ is documented,
and potential of TQ in controlling cancer metastasis is
reported by a few studies [9, 11–13], but the mechanisms
behind the antimetastatic role of TQ is still obscure or
unknown. This study investigated the role of TQ on the
expression of EMT mediator proteins like Cadherins
and Vimentin, and their regulatory transcription factors
TWIST1, SNAIL1, SLUG and ZEB1 in metastatic cancer
cell lines, as well as tumor model of mice. The major
objective of our study was to clarify the anticancer and
antimetastatic mechanism of TQ in the axis of EMTcancer cross-linking.

RESULTS
Thymoquinone inhibits cancer cell growth,
migration, and invasion
To investigate the TQ effects on cancer cell
growth, migration and invasion, the cell index results
were evaluated by real time cell analyzer, which showed
that TQ inhibited the growth, migration and invasive
characteristics in all of the three tested cancer cell lines
MDA-MB-435, BT549 and HeLa. TQ was found effective
even at a low concentration (1 μM), and the inhibition
was found highly significant at a concentration of 5 μM
(Figure 1). MTT analysis confirmed the dose dependent
cytotoxic activity of TQ against these cancer cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S1).

associated proteins

Regulation of migration and invasion by
Thymoquinone in TWIST1-knockdown and
TWIST1-overexpressed inducible cells

In order to investigate the TQ effect on the expression
of EMT associated proteins, cancer cells were treated with
5 μM of TQ for 6 hours, and then total RNA was extracted
from cells for quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). The
qPCR analysis showed that TQ significantly inhibited the
mRNA level expression of TWIST1 and N-Cadherin in
all of the MDA-MB-435, BT549 and HeLa cell lines (P <
0.05) (Figure 2). Some extents of reduction in SNAIL1 and
Vimentin were also observed, especially in MDA-MB-435
cells by TQ treatment; however, no significant change in
SLUG or ZEB1 expression was observed (Figure 2). To
determine protein expression, cancer cells were treated
with 5 μM of TQ for 48 hours, and proteins were extracted
for Western blot analysis. Like mRNA level expression,
TWIST1 and N-Cadherin expressions at protein level were
inhibited by TQ treatment in MDA-MB-435, BT549 and
HeLa cell lines; however, no significant change in SNAIL1
was observed (P > 0.05) (Figure 2). Both of the mRNA and
protein levels of E-Cadherin were expressed minimally or
completely unexpressed in these three cancer cell lines. We
speculated that TQ treatment decreases the expression of
TWIST1 and its downstream protein N-Cadherin in cancer
cells, while SNAIL1 and Vimentin were partially affected
in cell specific manner.

TWIST1 has been regarded as an oncogene [14],
and knockdown of TWIST1 is expected to be beneficial
against cancer. In this study, TWIST1 gene was knocked
down in 4T1 mouse breast cancer cells by shRNA
technology. Then, TWIST1-knockdown cells (4T1ShT) and control (4T1-ShC) cells were treated with TQ
(5 μM) for the investigation of cell growth, migration, and
invasion index by real time cell analyzer. Results showed
that the cellular growth, migration, and invasion rates were
reduced in knockdown (4T1-ShT) cells than in control
(4T1-ShC) cells (Figure 3). TQ treatment also reduced
and even potentiated TWIST1 knockdown leading to an
inhibition of 4T1 cell growth, migration and invasion (these
characteristics were found lower in 4T1-ShC-TQ and 4T1ShT-TQ cells) (Figure 3). For the investigation of the
expression of TWIST1 and its downstream proteins, after
6 h of TQ treatment (5 μM), the mRNAs and after 48 h
of TQ treatment, the proteins were extracted from cancer
cell lines. The qPCR and Western blot analysis showed that
TWIST1 expression was reduced more significantly in both
of the control and knockdown cells (4T1-ShC-TQ and 4T1ShT-TQ) than in 4T1-ShC and 4T1-ShT cells respectively
(P < 0.05). Interestingly, E-Cadherin expression was

(B. upper panel) and HeLa (C. upper panel) cells. Some extents of inhibition were also observed in SNAIL1 and Vimentin expression,
especially in MDA-MB-435 cells (A: upper panel). But, TQ showed no significant change in ZEB1 and SLUG expression. Again, TQ
treatment (5 μM) for 48 h inhibited the protein level expression of TWIST1 and N-Cadherin MDA-MB-435 (A: middle and lower panel),
BT549 (B: middle and lower panel) and HeLa (C: middle and lower panel) cells. However, SNAIL1 expression was found changed nonsignificantly. Results are expressed as mean ±SD (N = 3); *P < 0.05.

Figure 3: Effects of Thymoquinone (TQ) on the TWIST1-knockdown 4T1 cancer cells. The cellular growth rate, migration
and invasion were reduced in knockdown (4T1-ShT) cells than control (4T1-ShC) cells A. TQ treatment also reduced the 4T1 cell growth,
migration, and invasion (A). After 6 h of TQ treatment (5 μM), the mRNA level, and after 48 h of treatment, the protein level expressions of
TWIST1 were reduced significantly in both of the control and knockdown cells B, C. With the decrease of TWIST1, E-cadherin expression
was increased by TQ treatment (B, C). Results are expressed as mean ±SD (N = 3); *P < 0.05.

increased in TQ-treated cells (in an opposite manner to
TWIST1 expression). However, TWIST1 knockdown
showed an increase of the E-Cadherin expression less than
the TQ-treated cells (Figure 3). Both of the mRNA and
protein levels of N-Cadherin were expressed minimally
or completely unexpressed in 4T1 cell lines (data not
shown). Thus, we report that TQ consistently reduced the
expression of TWIST1, which is associated with cancer cell
migration and invasion.
Endogenous TWIST1 expression in HEK293 cells
is very low or undetectable. TWIST1 was experimentally
overexpressed in inducible HEK293 cell lines, which have
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

been reported in our previous study [15]. This increased
TWIST1 level showed some extent of migratory and
invasive characteristics, although normal HEK293 had
very little migratory and invasive properties (also indicated
in a previous study [16]). There was no significant change
observed in cell growth pattern when TWIST1 was
overexpressed (Figure 4A). Interestingly, TQ treatment at
the first ~10 hours (from the time ~6 to ~16 h) did not block
cellular migration and invasion in HEK293-TWIST1 cells
(Figure 4A, yellow lines), but TQ treatment reduced the
abilities of cellular migration and invasion later (Figure 4A).
Meanwhile, TQ had little or no effect on ectopic TWIST1

TWIST1-overexpressed inducible HEK293 (293-TWIST1)
cells attenuated the cell migration and invasion partially,
without inhibition of TWIST1 expression.

studies indicated that the LD50 of TQ was 105 mg/kg and
870.9 mg/kg after intraperitoneal injection and oral gavages
respectively and TQ was effective as anticancer molecule
at even 4 mg/kg body weight/day [17]. Tumor growth
pattern in mice showed that TQ treatment for 3 weeks
efficiently inhibited the tumor growth in female BALB/c
mice (4T1-ShC-TQ and 4T1-ShT-TQ groups), but TWIST1
knockdown inhibited tumor growth by only some extents
(Figure 5). Tumor weight was also found significantly lower
in 4T1-ShC-TQ and 4T1-ShT-TQ groups (P < 0.05). Cancer
was metastasized into lung in 4T1-ShC group, which was
reduced in 4T1-ShT group. This indicates that TWIST1
knockdown reduced metastasis in breast cancer model of
mouse. Interestingly, TQ treatment also inhibited cancer
metastasis to the lungs (in 4T1-ShC-TQ and 4T1-ShT-TQ
groups) (Figure 5). Thus, our findings report the anticancer
and antimetastatic activity of TQ both in vitro and in vivo.
The mRNAs were extracted from mouse cancer tissues for
the analysis of the expression level by qPCR. TWIST1 and
N-Cadherin were found down-regulated and E-Cadherin
was found up-regulated by TQ treatment; however, the data
was found statistically insignificant (P > 0.05) (Figure 5).
This might be due to the highly variable physiological
systems in individual mice.

Thymoquinone directly targets TWIST1 gene
To investigate whether TQ directly targets TWIST1
gene, luciferase reporter assay was performed. The
TWIST1 reporter gene was transfected with or without TQ
treatment into HeLa cells, and after 48 h of transfection,
luciferase activity was measured and the results showed
that TQ dose dependently decreases the luciferase activity
(Relative Light Units, RLU) of TWIST1 promoter reporter
gene (Figure 4C). This indicates that TWIST1 might be a
direct target of TQ.

Effects of Thymoquinone on cancer cell-derived
xenograft tumors in mice
Four groups of mice were injected with 4T1 cells
(two with 4T1-ShC and two with 4T1-ShT) and fed (with
or without TQ) for 4 weeks, and then sacrificed. 10 mg/kg
body weight/day was used as TQ dosage, because previous

metastasis, as tumors metastasized to lung in 4T1-ShC group of mouse, but not in 4T1-ShT cells D. TQ treatment also inhibited cancer
metastasis to lung (D). The mRNA level expression of TWIST1 and N-Cadherin were found to be decreased and E-Cadherin was found to
be increased by TQ treatment in mouse breast cancer tissue E. Results are expressed as mean ±SD (N = 5); *P < 0.05.

dangerous and potentially lethal. Although the number of
cancer survivors continues to increase due to the longevity
and growth of the population and improvements in early
detection and early treatment [18], metastatic cancers are
among the major health burdens, and one of the main
causes of death currently. Controlling metastasis is a
major issue in cancer therapeutics now-a-days. Cancer cell
migration and invasion are the two major characteristics in
the process of metastasis. In this study, we have found that
TQ dose dependently inhibited the cancer cell migration
and invasion as well as cellular growth. Moreover, in
breast tumor model of mouse, TQ inhibited cancer growth
and lung metastasis. The anticancer and antimetastatic
activities of TQ have been previously reported by some
studies [11–13, 19–24], however, the mechanisms of
antimetastatic role of TQ is extremely complex and still
obscure.
We investigated the role of TQ on EMT mediators
in cancer cells, as several studies indicated that aberrant
expression of EMT mediators are associated with cancer
metastasis. Our study revealed that TQ down-regulates
TWIST1 and its target protein N-Cadherin (the cell
adhesion molecule) in MDA-MB-435, BT549 and HeLa
cell lines. Interestingly, both of TWIST1 and N-Cadherin
are usually high expressed in metastatic cancer cells [5,
25–27]. TWIST1 has been indicated as oncoprotein [14],

By the pyro-sequencing, the proximal promoter
methylation of TWIST1 gene on the CpG islands was found
increased by TQ treatment (5 μM for 24 h) in BT549 cells
(Figure 6), however, little or no change in HeLa and MDAMB-435 cells was observed (Supplementary Figure S2).
Thus, promoter methylation of TWIST1 gene might be
one of the mechanisms of TWIST1 down-regulation
by TQ, which might be a cancer-cell-specific mechanism.
To further investigate the change of the expressions of
DNA methylating enzymes-DNA methyl transferases
(DNMT1, DNMT3a), qPCRs were performed, but the
results showed that the expressions of DNMT1, DNMT3a
were not significantly changed (P > 0.05) (Supplementary
Figure S3). Western blot analysis was also performed for
the determination of DNMT1 protein in BT549 cells treated
with 5 μM of TQ or without TQ, which further confirmed
the qPCR results (Supplementary Figure S3).

Metastasis is a process through which cancer
cells spread from the place where it originates to other
places in the body. By this process, cancer becomes more

which, with the support of other transcription factors, like
SNAIL1, SLUG and ZEB1, regulates the expression of
Cadherins and some other proteins involved in both of
EMT and metastasis process, as well as cancer initiation
and progression [5, 6, 15, 16, 28–32]. Another protein,
E-Cadherin is usually suppressed in cancer cells [3, 5, 6,
26, 27, 33] but has been up-regulated in 4T1 mouse breast
cancer cell line by TQ treatment. The results of this study
thus showed that TQ down-regulates TWIST1 in cancer
cells, and also regulates the Cadherins (up-regulation
of E-Cadherin and down-regulation of N-Cadherin),
concomitantly with its antimetastatic activity. Generally,
over-expression of N-Cadherin and low-expression of
E-Cadherin are the hallmarks of EMT and metastasis, and
TWIST1 plays a key role behind this. Our study revealed
that TQ can reverse this Cadherin balance by downregulating TWIST1 in cancer cells. In vivo study also
indicated the tumor growth and metastasis inhibition by
TQ treatment in cancer cell-derived xenograft tumors in
mice. These findings clearly indicate that TQ is a potential
anticancer and antimetastatic compound, which might act
via targeting the EMT proteins, especially TWIST1.
Some studies have indicated that knockdown of
TWIST1 in cancer cell lines inhibits cancer initiation
progression and metastasis [4, 15, 34]. We have used
the TWIST1-knockdown 4T1 cell line for TQ treatment.
Both in vitro and in vivo studies of our investigation
revealed that knockdown of TWIST1 are associated with
the inhibition of migration and invasion of cancer cells.
Treatment of TQ in TWIST1 knockdown cancer cells
induced inhibition activity of migration and invasion.
TWIST1 knockdown also made little changes in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

E-Cadherin expression, but TQ up-regulated E-Cadherin
significantly. This indicates that TQ may up-regulate
E-Cadherin by some other mechanisms, in addition to
modifying TWIST1.
A previous study reported that TQ targets Akt
pathway, while promoting antimetastatic activity [11].
Another study indicated Wnt pathway as the target of
TQ [35]. Interestingly, Akt pathway or Wnt pathway are
directly related to the TWIST1 pathway in the progression
of cancer metastasis [36–38]. In our study, we also
have checked the Akt and Wnt expression, and found
that these are modified by TQ treatment in cancer cells
(Supplementary Figure S4).
TWIST1 was overexpressed in inducible HEK293
cell lines due to very low or undetectable endogenous
TWIST1 expression in HEK293 cells [15]. The increased
TWIST1 level showed some extent of migratory and
invasive characteristics, although normal HEK293 had
very little migratory and invasive properties [15, 16].
Interestingly, TQ treatment did not block cellular migration
and invasion in HEK293-TWIST1 cells at the first ~10 h
(from the time ~6 to ~16 h) (Figure 4A, yellow lines); later,
TQ treatment blocked cellular migration completely and
invasion partially or some extents (Figure 4). However, TQ
showed no significant inhibition on the ectopic TWIST1
expression (Figure 4B). This indicates that TQ treatment
in 293-TWIST1 cells attenuated the cell migration and
invasion partially, which supports the connection: TQTWIST1 in the axis of EMT-cancer cross-linking. However,
after 10 h TQ treatment, the abilities of cellular migration
and invasion in HEK293-TWIST1 cells were reduced.
This indicates that TQ effects on cellular migration and

invasion are dependent on TWIST expression, but later
does the same to other pathways too, such as Akt pathway
or Wnt pathway, which we also found was modified by
TQ treatment in cancer cells (Supplementary Figure S4).
Meanwhile, the lucifease assay confirmed that TQ can
directly interfered with TWIST1 promoter reporter gene
activity. Therefore, our study indicates that TWIST1
might be a direct target of TQ; however, other molecules/
pathways might also be involved later. As metastasis is
a complex biochemical and physiological process with
several molecular pathways involved in this process, we
speculate that TQ targets one or more signaling molecules
in these pathways, and TWIST1 might be an important
target by TQ for its role of anticancer and antimetastasis.
Promoter methylation of TWIST1 gene has been
reported in several cancers, especially in distant metastasis
[39–41]. Interestingly, methylation of TWIST1 promoter
is associated with protein expression in tumor stroma to
influence the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-like tumor
budding phenotype in colorectal cancer [40]. However, no
clear association was found between TWIST1 promoter
methylation and TWIST1 expression in breast cancer
[39]. In our study, we have found the promoter region
of TWIST1 gene in MDA-MB-435 and HeLa cancer cell
lines are highly hypermethylated, and TQ treatment did not
make any change in methylation level of TWIST1 promoter
in these two cell lines. However, TQ treatment increased
the methylation level at all of the CpG islands of TWIST1
promoter in BT549 cells, which we speculate that TQ
treatment might be associated with TWIST1 expression.
This promoter methylation of TWIST1 by TQ is most likely
cancer cell-specific, and might be associated with TWIST1
down-regulation. DNA methylating enzyme DNA methyl
transferases 1 (DNMT1) is necessary in maintaining
global methylation and aberrant CpG island methylation
in human cancer cells [42], whereas the de novo DNA
methyltransferase 3a (DNMT3a) is responsible for the
establishment of de novo genomic DNA methylation
patterns, involving in normal development and in many
diseases including cancer [43]. So the qPCR and Western
blot analysis were performed to examine the mRNA and
protein expression of DNMT1. However, results showed
that both of DNMT1 and DNMT3a were not significantly
changed by TQ treatment in the tested cancer cell lines.
We speculate that DNA methylation status is somehow
modified by TQ and TQ might play a role in TWIST1
promoter methylation in cell specific manner or through
unknown pathways. Thus, the epigenetic role of TQ
on TWIST1 and other EMT-associated proteins is also
interesting for our future research.
In conclusion, we suggest TQ, a potential anticancer
and antimetastatic natural compound, might be used
for further clinical studies and applications in cancer
therapeutics. Our study indicates that TWIST1 along with
its down-stream proteins, especially Cadherins are the
novel targets of TQ treatment in cancer cells. This study

Ethics statement
Investigation for animal model has been conducted
in accordance with the ethical standards and according to
the Declaration of Helsinki and according to national and
international guidelines. The protocol has been approved
by the Sichuan Medical University review board.

Cell culture and Thymoquinone treatment
The inducible HEK293 cell line with over-expressed
TWIST1 (293-TWIST1) was described previously [15].
Human cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435, HeLa and BT549,
and mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 were cultured in
DMEM or RPMI1640 media (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hangzhou
Sijiqing Biological Engineering Materials Co., Ltd.,
China). TQ was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA) and suspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Different concentrations of TQ were used to treat cancer
cell lines, while DMSO was used as control.

Cell growth, migration and invasion assay
A real time cell analyzer (xCELLigence RTCA DP,
Roche, Germany) was used for the real time analysis of
cell migration, invasion and growth index [15]. 100 μl of
cell suspensions (5 × 104 cells/ml) were seeded on each of
the 16 well E-plate for cell growth index. CMI plates were
used for cell migration and invasion index analysis, where
the lower chamber wells were filled with chemotaxis
inducer (10% serum supplemented media), and 100 μl of
cell suspensions (5 × 104 cells/ml) in serum free medium
were added into the wells of upper chamber. For cell
invasion assay, the membrane of the CMI plate was precoated with Matrigel (354277, BD Biosciences) with 1:40
diluted in 1 × PBS before cells were seeded. After a certain
period of cell growth (4–12 h, indicated in the figures),
TQ of different concentrations (1–10 μM) were added into
the wells. The process of cell migration and invasion was
monitored every 30 min till the experimental endpoint. Cell
viability was examined by MTT [3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, a tetrazole]
assay. Briefly, in a 96-well cell culture plate, 1 × 105 cells
(in 100 μl media) were plated per well with different
concentrations of TQ (1–50 μM), and incubated for 24 h.
Then 10 μl of MTT reagent was added and incubated for
3 h until purple precipitate was visible. The upper solution
(media + MTT) was then removed carefully, and 100 μl
of detergent (DMSO) was added into each well. The plate
was kept in the dark at room temperature for 2 h, and then

RNA extraction, RT-PCR and qPCR analysis
After TQ treatment for 6 h, cellular total-RNA was
extracted by using RNeasy® mini kit (Cat No: 74104,
Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA
concentration was measured by using ND-1000 UV/
Vis spectrophotometer (NanoDrop, USA) and final
concentration was set as 150 ng/μl for cDNA synthesis
(reverse transcriptase/RT-PCR). In a 10 μl of RT reaction
system, 2 μl of 5 × RT buffer, 1 μl of dNTPs, 0.5 μl of
random primer, 0.5 μl of Rev. Ace (enzyme, purchased from
TOYOBO and BIOBRK companies of China), 0.25 μl of
super RI, 0.25 μl of RT-enhancer, 2.25 μl of RNase free
water and 3.25 μl of RNA (150 ng/μl) were taken. The
reaction was completed in a thermocyler (Mastercycler
gradient, Eppendorf, Germany) with the following steps:
10 min at 30°C, 30 min at 42°C, 5 min at 99°C, 5 min at
4°C, followed by final holding at 16°C. The synthesized
cDNAs were then diluted by adding 40 μl ddH2O, and
used as templates for quantitative PCR (qPCR). The
sequence-specific fluorescence-labeled probes and primers
for Taqman qPCR were matched by the Universal Probe
Library Center (Roche, Germany) [15, 32, 44, 45]. The
primer sequences for the investigated RNA of precursor
genes are presented in Supplementary (Table 1 & 2). 18S
RNA was used as internal control. In a 10 μl of the reaction
system, 5 μl of 2 × PCR-probe mix, 0.02 μl of probe, 1 μl
of primers, 2 μl of H2O and 2 μl of cDNA were mixed,
and reaction was completed in StepOne plus Thermocycler
(Applied Biosystem) with a 40 cycle of amplification
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Relative contents
of mRNA were obtained by normalization to 18 S RNA,
and were calculated and expressed as 2-ΔΔCT.

Generation of TWIST1-knockdown and
TWIST1-overexpressed cell lines
TWIST1 gene was knocked down in 4T1 cells
by using shRNA technology [47]. The lentiviral vector
construct pLKO-Tet-On that contains all the necessary
cis-elements for packaging, reverse transcription, and
integration, were used for the inducible expression of
shRNA in target cells. In the absence of doxycycline
(DOX), shRNA expression was repressed by constitutivelyexpressed TetR protein. Upon the addition of DOX to the
culture media, shRNA expression was triggered resulting in
TWIST1 gene knock-down [15, 47]. TWIST1 Knockdown
cells (4T1-ShT) and control (4T1-ShC) cells were treated
with TQ for the investigation of cell growth, migration and
invasion index, as well as mRNA and protein expression
of TWIST1, N-Cadherin and E-Cadherin. Also, we have
constructed an inducible HEK293 cell line with overexpressed TWIST1 (293-TWIST1) [15], and treated with
TQ for the investigation of cell growth, migration and
invasion index, as well as protein expression of TWIST1.
In this case, flag-tagged TWIST1 gene was transfected into
HEK293 cells and inducible expressed by treating with
DOX. During Western blot analysis for protein expression
determination, flag antibody was used for the measurement
of ectopic TWIST1 expression.

Luciferase reporter assay
Luciferase reporter assay was performed by using
TWIST1 promoter reporter gene which has been reported
previously [31, 48]. 40%-confluent HeLa cells in 12well plates were transfected with 100 ng of the pGL3hTWIST1-Luc promoter/reporter plasmid in each well
without or with indicated different concentration of TQ
(0.25–4 μM), and the activity was measured by using
Luciferase Assay System (Promega, USA). The relative
luciferase activity, expressed as ‘Relative Light Units’
(RLU) was determined by using 3010Luminometer (BD
Monolight™, USA) after two days of transfection. All
experiments were performed in triplicates.

Protein extraction and western blot analysis
After TQ treatment for 48 h, cellular proteins were
extracted by using EBC lysis buffer [46]. Proteins were then
separated on vertical polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE), and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The
membrane was kept in 5% milk (in 1 × TBST) at 4°C for
2 h, and then incubated with primary antibody solution at
4°C for 12 h with gentle shaking. The membrane was then
washed thrice with TBST, and incubated with secondary
antibody tagged with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) for
4~8  h at room temperature with gentle shaking. The
membrane was again washed thrice with TBST, and protein
bands were visualized after the chemiluminiscence reaction
by using a digital imaging system (Universal Hood II, BioRad Lab, Italy) [45, 46]. The primary antibodies used in
this study were anti-TWIST1 (Abcam), anti-SNAIL1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, Inc), anti-N-Cadherin (Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-E-Cadherin (Cell Signaling Technology),

Generation of breast tumor model of mouse and
in vivo study of TQ effects
Twenty female BALB/c mice (5 weeks of old) [15]
were divided into 4 groups. Group 1 and group 2 were
injected with 4T1-ShC cells (2 × 105 cells in 1 × PBS with
19588

Oncotarget

a total volume of 100 μl), and group 3 and group 4 were
injected with 4T1-ShT cells (2 × 105 cells in 1 × PBS with
a total volume of 100 μl). 1% Phenobarbital sodium (in 1 ×
PBS) was used as anesthetic. Cancer cells were injected into
the both sides of the mouse mammary fat pad [15]. Mice
were fed with normal diet and drinking water regularly.
From the next week, when tumors appeared, group 2 mice
were being fed with TQ (10 mg/kg body weight/day),
and group 3 mice were being fed with 0.5 mg/mouse/day
of DOX with drinking water, while group 4 mice were
being fed with both of the DOX and TQ. Mice were fed
for another three weeks, and tumor volume was measured
by using slide calipers on each week. For measuring tumor
volume, the following formula was applied:
Volume (A) = 1/2 [Length × Width2]
After four weeks of cancer cell injection, mice
were sacrificed, and tumor tissues were collected. Lungs
of the mice were also collected to observe the metastasis
of cancer into lungs. Total RNA materials were extracted
from tumor tissues for the analysis of mRNA level
expression by qPCR.

displayed in a small colored box just above each CpG site,
where a 100% denotes a fully methylated C, a 0% denotes
an unmethylated C, and intermediate C/T percentages
denote partial methylation in the genomic DNA.

Statistical analysis
Data was analyzed by one-way ANOVA and then
posthoc comparisons by using SPSS16 software, and
graphs were constructed by using MS-Excel 2010.
Results are usually presented as mean ± SD. P < 0.05 was
considered as significant difference.

Gene methylation assay
MDA-MB-435, HeLa and BT549 cells were treated
with TQ (5 μM) for 24 h, and DNA was extracted by
using TIANamp genomic DNA kit (TianGen, China).
The PCR products from bisulfite-treated genomic DNA
samples were analyzed with Pyrosequencing technology,
in order to quantify the site-specific methylation. The
Qiagen bisulfite kit was used for the treatment of
genomic DNA and the primers used for the amplification
of TWIST1 gene promoter by PCR were as follows:
F: GGGAGAGATGAGATATTATTTATTGTGT; R:
CTCCTCCCAAACCATTCAA. The sequencing samples
were prepared with the Vacuum Prep workstation (Biotage
AB, Uppsala, Sweden) according to the following
protocol: 40 μl of the amplicons, 3 μl streptavidin
Sepharose HP beads (GE Healthcare), 37 μl binding
buffer (10 mmol/l Tris-HCl, 2 M NaCl, 1 mmol/l
EDTA, 0.1% Tween-20, and 15 μl Milli-Q (18.2 MΩ ×
cm) water, pH 7.6) were mixed and kept for 5–10 min.
The biotinylated amplicons were immobilized onto the
streptavidin sepharose beads and then passed through
one denaturation step and two washing steps using the
Vacuum Prep workstation. The amplicons were transferred
to a plate containing 0.4 μmol/l sequencing primer
(AGGAGGGGAAGGAAA) in 40 μl annealing buffer
(20 mmol/l Tris-acetate, 2 mmol/l magnesium acetate,
pH 7.6). Then the plate was heated with the samples at
80°C for 2 min. Pyrosequencing was performed using the
PyroMark Gold Q96 Reagent and the PyroMark ID system
(QIAGEN). Pyro Q-CpG™ software v. 1.0.9 was used to
measure the optimal order of nucleotide addition, when
designing the assays. The software also automatically
analyzed the methylation results. Each site is analyzed as
