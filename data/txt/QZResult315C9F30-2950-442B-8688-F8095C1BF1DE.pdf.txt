ABSTRACT
Sufficient knowledge regarding cellular and molecular basis of lung cancer
progression and metastasis would help in the development of novel and effective
strategies for the treatment of lung cancer. 4HPR is a synthetic retinoid with potential
anti-tumor activity but is still limited because of its poor bioavailability. The use of
albumin as a complexing agent for a hydrophobic drug is expected to improve the
water solubility and consequently their bioavailability.This study investigated the
antitumor activity of a novel complex between albumin and 4-HPR in a mouse model
of human lung cancer and focuses on role and mechanism of Cav-1 mainly involved
in regulating cancer and Acsvl3 mainly connected with tumor growth.
Their expressions were assayed by immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR, to
demonstrate the reduction of the tumor growth following the drug treatment. Our
results showed a high antitumor activity of 4HPR-HSA by reduction of the volume of
tumor mass and the presence of a high level of apoptotic cell by TUNEL assay. The
downregulation of Cav-1 and Acsvl3 suggested a reduction of tumor growth.
In conclusion, we demonstrated the great potential of 4HPR-HSA in the treatment
of lung cancer. More data about the mechanism of drug delivery the 4HPR-HSA are
necessary.

INTRODUCTION

proteins, are the principal structural proteins in caveolae.
Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) binds to signaling molecules such as
G-proteins, Src family tyrosine kinases, receptor tyrosine
kinases (epidermal growth factor receptor), protein kinase
C and eNOS and can functionally inactivate the enzymatic
activity of these molecules [4]. The gene encoding
human caveolin-1 is located in on chromosome 7q31.1,
downstream of the D7S522 locus, in the fragile site
FRA7G [5, 6]. Deletions of this region are frequently noted
in human cancers including squamous cell carcinoma [7],
sarcoma [8], prostate carcinoma [9], renal cell carcinoma
[10] and ovarian carcinoma [11]. Furthermore lower
caveolin-1 expressions were reported in some human
malignant tumors [12-14]. These results suggested that

Lung cancer has become the most common
malignant tumor and the major cause of cancer deaths
worldwide. The overall 5-years survival rate for lung
cancer is only 15% [1-2]. Although combination
chemotherapy has improved the prognosis of patients
with non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), there are still
many patients who have initial resistance to chemotherapy
or develop drug resistance after several courses of
chemotherapy [3]. The development of new therapeutic
drugs for the treatment of NSCLC has become an
important area for research in cancer therapy.

caveolin-1 might be involved in oncogenesis as a tumor
suppressor [6]. In contrast caveolin-1 overexpression was
also reported in some human carcinomas [15]. In addition
it was reported that caveolin-1 expression in tumor cells
affects the clinical outcome and prognosis of patients with
squamous cell carcinoma of the lung [16]. That suggests
caveolin-1expression is significantly correlated with an
advanced pathological stage and a poor prognosis in nonsmall cell carcinomas of the lung (NSCLC) [16]. Recent
studies have demonstrated that Cav-1 can directly confer
the anoikis resistance in NSCLC by the interaction with its
antiapoptotic partner Mcl-1 protein and prevent the latter
protein from the degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasomal
system [17]. These results suggest that caveolin-1 plays a
biological role in the regulation of tumor invasiveness, and
that it should be regarded as a prognostic marker for these
tumors and as a possible target for new drugs [8].
At a physiologic level caveolin functions as a
scaffolding protein to organize and concentrate specific
lipids and lipid-modified signaling molecules in particular
cell membrane microdomains inducing caveolae formation
[18]. The main role of caveolae is the uptake and transport
of macromolecules from the extracellular space to the
intracellular environment.
Albumin is one of the caveolar ligands. Indeed, it
undergoes continuous receptor-mediated transcytosis
across endothelia via caveolae [19,20]. Being albumin
one of the most abundant serum proteins that functions
as a carrier for fatty acids, steroids and thyroid hormones,
the caveolae-mediated transcytosis of albumin represents
the mechanism by which these important molecules
are distributed from the vascular space to surrounding
tissues [21,22]. Very Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Synthetase 3
(Acsvl3) catalyzes the ATP-dependent thioesterification of
fatty acids (FA) to coenzyme A (CoA). This ‘‘activation
step’’ is necessary for FA to participate in nearly all
subsequent metabolic reactions. In addition to their
metabolic functions, these enzymes were also proven to be
FA transport proteins (FATP). Recent studies showed that
upregulation of Acsvl3 is correlated with poor prognosis
in lung cancer because it supports malignancy by altering
tumor cell metabolism [23].
Fenretinide or N-4-hydroxyphenyl-retinamide (4HPR) is a synthetic retinoid which emerged as a promising
anticancer agent based on numerous in vitro and animal
studies as well as chemoprevention clinical trials [2437]. Despite its excellent tolerability the therapeutic
efficacy of fenretinide is still limited because of its poor
bioavailability. The strong hydrophobic character of
fenretinide limits its solubility in blood and biological
body fluids thus limiting its bioavailability towards tumor
cells and consequently its therapeutic activity.
Fenretinide encapsulation in amphiphilic micelles
[38-41] or PLA microspheres [39] has proven increased
bioavailability and antitumor activity.
In this study we complexed fenretinide with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Human Serum Albumin [HSA] with the aim to enhance
its bioavailability through an improvement of its aqueous
solubility and to exploit the Albumin affinity to cav-1
to favour the uptake of the complex in the tumor cells
expressing high levels of cav-1.
We evaluated the antitumor activity of the
complex in a mouse xenograft model of human lung
adenocarcinoma. Apoptotic cell death was detected by
ematossilin and eosin staining and TUNEL assay. Cav
– 1 and ACSVL3 expressions were chosen as tumor
biomarkers to demonstrate the reduction of the tumor
growth following the drug treatment.

RESULTS

Figure 1 shows the xenograft tumors of A549 in the
right flank of nude mice not treated (Figure 1A) and after
treatment with 4HPR-HSA (Figure 1B) at the end of the
experiment .Tumor proliferation curve showed that in the
treated mice the tumors grew significantly slower than

untreated ones (Figure 1C). HPLC analysis indicated that
fenretinide was absorbed in the tumors after administration
of the complex indeed a mean drug concentration of 5.7 ±
1.34 uM was obtained at the end of the experiment

To investigate the effect of 4HPR-HSA in the
tumor tissue we performed Tunnel assay to demonstrate
the presence of apoptotic cells after the drug treatment.
We found the drug signiﬁcantly increases the number
of Tunnel-positive cells in the treated group (Fig. 3)
compared to the non treated group (Fig. 4) with about 86%
apoptotic area when compared with the untreated group
(Fig. 5). These results suggest that 4HPR-HSA induces
cell death by apoptosis.

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
To evaluate the anti-tumor efficacy after treatment
with albumin-fenretinide complex, tumors were dissected
from mice for histopathalogical analysis. H&E results
show that tumor cells with large nuclei of spherical or
spindle shape were observed in the tumor tissue treated
with PBS (untreated samples) (Figure 2 A-B) while
various degrees of dead cells were observed in the group
treated with the drug (Figure 2 C-D). Quantitative analysis
shows that the necrotic area corresponding to the eosin
stained area, is almost three fold larger compared to
untreated tumors (Figure 2E).

Immunohistochemistry for caveolin – 1 protein

immunohistochemical analysis was performed in tumor
tissue of treated and untreated mice. Figure 6A shows
a wide expression of caveolin – 1 protein in untreated
samples almost 6 fold higher compared to treated ones
(Figure 6E). The staining of the protein is distributed
throughout the tumor area in all the analyzed untreated
sections. At higher magnification it is possible to observe
a high signal of caveolin-1 protein in the cytoplasm of
the cells (Figure 6B) in agreement with a poor prognosis
of lung tumor. Treated tumor shows a low signal of
caveolin-1 protein due to 4HPR-HSA (Figure 6C-D).
At higher magnification it is possible to detect several
damage of nuclei due to the treatment (Figure 6D).

changes conferring growth advantage but also factors
which disrupt regulation of growth and differentiation.
Although combination chemotherapy has improved the
prognosis of lung cancer, there are still many patients who
have initial resistance to chemotherapy or develop it after
several cycles of therapy. Therefore the identification of
new therapeutic approaches is extremely important to
improve the prognosis of cancer lung patients. To this
end the caveolae-dependent transcytosis of albumin in the
pulmonary endothelium, triggered by the interaction of
albumin with caveolin-1, is emerging as an important tool
in the design of novel therapeutic systems based on the use
of albumin as a carrier for antitumor drugs [42].
Cav-1 plays an important role in regulating the
behaviour of cancer cells including anoikis resistance in
NSCLC by the interaction with its antiapoptotic partner
[17]. Although combination chemotherapy has improved
the prognosis of lung cancer, still many patients have
initial resistance to chemotherapy or develop it after
several cycles of therapy. The identification of new
therapeutic drugs for lung cancer is extremely important
to improve the prognosis of lung cancer patients.
Albumin is already used as a drug carrier in
several anticancer drug formulations evaluated clinically,
including the methotrexate-albumin conjugate (MTXHSA) [43,44], albumin –binding prodrug of doxorubicin
(DOXO-EMCH) [45,46] and albumin paclitaxel
nanoparticle (Abraxane). The latter also approved by FDA
for treating metastatic breast cancer [47-49].
Fenretinide or N-4-hydroxyphenyl-retinamide
(4HPR) is a synthetic retinoid which emerged as a
promising anticancer agent based on numerous in vitro
and animal studies as well as chemoprevention clinical
trials [24-37]. The interest in the clinical use of fenretinide
arises from its strong antitumor activity combined with a
low toxicity profile. The anticancer activity of fenretinide
results from its ability to induce apoptosis in tumor cells
by improving diverse signaling molecules including
reactive oxygen species, ceramide and ganglioside GD3.
In particular fenretinide has been shown to possess
cytotoxic activity on a wide variety of experimental
models belonging to different types of cancer, including
lung cancer [50-53].
Despite its excellent tolerability the therapeutic
efficacy of fenretinide is still limited because of its poor
bioavailability. Indeed, the strong hydrophobic character
of fenretinide limits its solubility in blood and biological
body fluids thus limiting its bioavailability towards the
tumor cells and consequently its therapeutic activity.
Among the different approaches carried out to raise
the bioavailability of fenretinide [38-41] complexation
with amphiphilic macromolecules provided the best
results. In this study we chose Human Serum Albumin
as a macromolar complexing agent for fenretinide with
the aim to exploit the concomitant ability of albumin to
complex fenretinide increasing its bioavailability and to

Quantitative Real Time Polymerase Chain
Reaction (qRT-PCR)
The mRNA expression of caveolin-1 and acsvl3
is evaluated by qRT-PCR in untreated tumor tissue and
the results are compared to treated samples (Figure 8AB). Results show a 9 fold up regulation of caveolin-1 in
untreated tumor samples compared to samples treated
with 4HPR-HSA (Figure 8A) while the mRNA expression
of acsvl3 is 20 fold upregulated in untreated samples
compared to treated tumor tissues (Figure 8B). These
results are in agreement with immunohystochemistry data
and demonstrate that the treatment with 4HPR-HSA due to
a downregulation of caveolin-1 and acsvl3 mRNA reduces
tumor cell proliferation.

DISCUSSION
Lung cancer has long been recognized as a
multi‑step process which involves not only genetic

link caveolin-1 providing a targeted drug release towards
the populations of cancer cells.
The use of albumin as a complexing agent for
fenretinide is believed to improve its water solubility
and consequently its bioavailability. Moreover the
affinity of albumin for caveolin-1 is believed to target the
drug specifically to cancer cell populations expressing
high levels of this surface protein. The concomitant
improvement in bioavailability and drug targeting should
provide a significant increase in the antitumor activity. As
reported in the scientific literature lung tumor cells express
high levels of caveoli-1 [16].
To evaluate the antitumor activity of 4HPRHSA A549 human cells of lung adenocaricinoma were
implanted subcutaneously on nude mice . All experimental
procedures involving animals were performed in
compliance with the European Council Directive
86/609/EEC on the care and use of laboratory animals
and approved by ethical committed of the University of
Bologna (Prot.n. 43-IX/9 of 11/20/2012).
The measurements of the subcutaneous tumor mass
reveals a significant reduction of the volume in treated
mice compared to control mice suggesting a strong
antitumor activity of 4HPR-HSA.
To evaluate the presence of cell death in tumor mass
exposed to albumin-fenretinide complex tumors were
dissected from mice and processed for histopathalogical
analysis. H&E staining showed necrotic areas in the
treated tumors three fold larger compared to untreated
tumor mass suggesting a high level of cell death induced
by the drug.
To better evaluate the presence of apoptosis in the
dead areas TUNEL assay was carried out in sections of
tumor mass obtained from treated and control samples.
Results showed the presence of several apoptotic cells
in the treated sample compared to the untreated sample
suggesting that 4HPR-HSA induced cell death mainly by
apoptosis in agreement with previous data demonstrating
the apoptotic effect of 4-HPR [50-53].
Thus based on these previous results an
immunohistochemistry analysis was performed on
sections of the tumor to evaluate the expression of cav-1
and Acsvl3, NSCLC biomarkers whom overexpression is
correlated with tumor growth, invasiveness and metastatic
potential [54]. Immunohistochemistry results showed a
strong downregulation of caveolin-1 and Acsvl3 proteins
in treated mice compared to untreated ones. These data
are confimed by qRT-PCR in which a 9 fold upregulation
of caveolin-1 in untreated tumor samples and a 20 fold
upregulation of acsvl3 in untreated samples were shown.
The Acsvl3 protein is strictly connected with the
lipid metabolism and in lung tumor cells its overexpression
is responsible for tumor growth [23]. We suppose that
the downregulation observed in tumor mass after 4HPRHSA treatment is responsible of a deregulation of lipid
metabolism which reduces tumor growth.
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

In conclusion our results show a high antitumor
activity of 4HPR-HSA demonstrated by the reduction of
the volume of tumor mass and the presence of a high level
of apoptotic cell death. The downregulation of the tumor
biomarkers caveolin-1 and Acsvl3 suggests a reduction
of tumor growth. 4HPR-HSA has a great potential in the
treatment of lung cancer. More data about the mechanism
of interaction between 4HPR-HSA and caveolin-1 protein
are necessary. Experiments regarding this interaction and
the delivery mechanism of the drug due as a complex with
albumin proteins are in progress in our laboratory.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell line
The lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 was
purchased by the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Cell lines cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle
Medium / F12 (DMEM/F12) (Gibco, Life Technologies,
Monza, Italy) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine
Serum (FBS, Gibco, Life Technologies, Monza, Italy)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin and were then incubated
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. The cells
were subcultured once a week using 1% trypsin (Gibco),
expanded in new T75 flasks and maintained at 37°C in a
humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Cells from passages 2
to 5 were utilized for the experiments described.

Preparation of albumin-fenretinide complex
The albumin-fenretinide complex was prepared
by mixing a fenretinide solution in ethanol with an HSA
solution in water. The fenretinide solution obtained by
dissolving 200 mg of the drug in 1 ml ethanol, was added
to an HSA solution prepared by 1g of HSA in 10 ml
water. After stirring 10 min at RT in the dark the mixture
was sonicated in a Vibra-Cell VCX 400 Sonicator at 40
kHz for 2 h. The temperature was maintained constant
at 40° C by a thermostated circulating water bath. After
sonication the mixture was diluted with 40 ml phosphate
buffer pH 7.4 and filtered through a 0.22 um filter to
obtain an homogeneous suspension of the albuminfenretinide complex with a mean diameter below 0.22
µm. The fenretinide concentration was determined by
a spectrophotometric analysis of the filtrate at 360 nm
against a blank consisting of a dispersion of void albumin
prepared by the same method.

access to sterile food and water. All experimental
procedures involving animals were performed in
compliance with the European Council Directive
86/609/EEC on the care and use of laboratory animals
and approved by ethical committed of the University of
Bologna (Prot.n. 43-IX/9 of 11/20/2012). Each experiment
employed the minimum number of mice needed to obtain
statistically meaningful results. To evaluate the activity
of 4HPR-HSA in a mice model A459 cells (5 × 106 cells/
mouse in a 200 ul volume of serum-free medium) were
implanted subcutaneously in the right flank. Animals were
routinely monitored and at the appearance of a visible
subcutaneous tumor mass and tumor dimensions were
measured every 2 days in two perpendicular directions
using calipers. The mice were then randomized into 2
groups of 10 animals.
The animals were routinely monitored and upon
the appearance of a visible subcutaneous tumour mass,
the dimensions were measured every 2 days in two
perpendicular directions using calipers. Tumour volume
(mm3) was defined as follows: (W12 x W2) x (π/6), where
W1 and W2 are the largest and smallest tumour diameters
(mm), respectively.
When the tumors reached a mean volume of 150
mm3, 10 animals were treated with 4HPR-HSA and 10
were the untreated control group (PBS), given slowly
through the tail vein in a volume of 200 μl. The drug was
administered at the dose of 1 mg/Kg every 3 days for
a total of 12 administrations by tail vein injection. The
experiment was terminated 48 days after the start of the
treatment. At day 48, 24 h after the last administration,
the mice were sacrificed and the tumors collected to
determine their fenretinide content by HPLC. Immediately
after removal, the tumors were homogenized by a tissue
homogenizer with a 1:3 w:v ratio of physiologic saline
(0.9% NaCl, w/v). They were subsequently extracted with
ice-cold acetonitrile (1:1 v:v), mixed by vortex and placed
in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. The mixture obtained
was then centrifuged at 10,000 × g at 4°C for 5 min and
the supernatant injected directly into the HPLC system.
The HPLC analysis was carried out by a Waters 2690
Separation Module equipped with a C18 (5-µm) reversephase column (150 × 4.6 mm) and a C18 precolumn
(Perkin-Elmer, Milan, Italy). The mobile phase consisted
of CH3CN : H2O : CH3COOH (75 : 23 : 2, vol/vol/vol)
delivered at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Detection was carried
out with a Waters 2487 UV absorbance detector set at 340
nm [55] .
We did not treat the animals with pure 4-HPR as its
water insolubility would require a previous dissolution in
ethanol or other water-mixable organic solvents followed
by dilution with an aqueous phase before injection. As
it is well known the dilution triggers drug precipitation
due to the mixing of the organic solvent with water. Even
if this procedure is widely used for the in vitro studies
of poorly soluble drugs it is not a suitable experimental

Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining
Tumor samples were subjected for routine
histopathological examination by standard H&E staining.
Small pieces were collected in 4% paraformaldehyde for
proper fixation and then were processed and embedded
in paraffin wax. Sections were cut and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin. Samples were observed under light
microscope using an Eclipse E800 Nikon (Nikon, Tokyo,
Japan). Representative images were shown. Quantitative

as relative amount compared to eosin necrotic area of
untreated tumors (± SD), were assessed by area counting
of three fields for each of five slides per each sample at

Tunel Assay
The apoptotic cell death was assayed by in situ
detection of DNA fragmentation using the terminal
deoxynucleotidyl-transferase (TUNEL) assay. Paraffin
lung cancer tissue sections (5 μm) were warmed 30
min. (64°C), deparaffinized and rehydrated. Terminal
transferase mediated dUTP nick end-labeling of nuclei
was performed by using APO-BrdU TUNEL Assay kit
(A-23210; Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. Samples were observed under
fluorescence microscopy using an Eclipse E800 Nikon
(Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Representative images were
shown. Quantitative analysis of TUNEL positive areas
expressed as relative amount of treated area compared
to untreated ones, were assessed by area counting of

Immunohistochemistry
The sections were deparaffinised and rehydrated
using 3 sequential changes of 100% xylene, 100%, 95%,
80% and 50% ethanol respectively. Briefly following
removal of the paraffin samples were boiled in citric
acid for 20 min. for antigen unmasking. In all cases
slides were cooled with running tap water and after
draining the array sections were equilibrated for 20 min.

Total RNA was extracted by RecoverAll Total
Nucleid Acid Isolation Kit (Ambion Life Technologies,
Monza, Italy) quantified using a NanoDrop® ND1000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific,
Wilmington, DE, USA) and cDNA was transcribed
with reverse transcriptase SUPIII (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA). The expression of mRNA was analyzed
by quantitative Real Time PCR using 7500 Real Time
PCR (Applied Biosystem, Life Technologies, Monza,
Italy). For the analysis the following TaqMan assays
(Applied Biosystems, Life Technologies, Monza, Italy)
were used: Caveolin-1 (Hs00971716_m1) and ACSVL3
(HS00950760_g1). The relative gene expressions were
normalized to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH Hs99999905_m1) and the data were
presented as the fold change using the formula 2-ΔΔCT as
recommended by the manufacturer (User Bulletin No.2
P/N 4303859, Applied Biosystems). Data showed the
average of triplicates ± SD and were representative from
three independent experiments.
