ABSTRACT
Purpose: Overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)
family and their ligands plays an important role in many cancers. Targeting multiple
members of the HER family simultaneously may increase the therapeutic efficacy.
Here, we report the ability to image the therapeutic response obtained by targeting
HER family members individually or simultaneously using the novel monoclonal
antibody (mAb) mixture Pan-HER.
Experimental design and results: Mice with subcutaneous BxPC-3 pancreatic
adenocarcinomas were divided into five groups receiving vehicle or mAb mixtures
directed against either EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3 or all three receptors combined by
Pan-HER. Small animal positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/
CT) with 2’-deoxy-2’-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) and 3’-deoxy-3’-[18F]fluorothymidine
(FLT) was performed at baseline and at day 1 or 2 after initiation of therapy. Changes
in tumor uptake of tracers were quantified and compared to reduction in tumor size.
Imaging results were further validated by immunohistochemistry and qPCR. Mean FDG
and FLT uptake in the Pan-HER treated group decreased by 19±4.3% and 24±3.1%,
respectively. The early change in FDG and FLT uptake correlated with tumor growth
at day 23 relative to day 0. Ex vivo molecular analyses of markers associated with the
mechanisms of FDG and FLT uptake confirmed the in vivo imaging results.
Conclusions: Taken together, the study supports the use of FDG and FLT as
imaging biomarkers of early response to Pan-HER therapy. FDG and FLT PET/CT
imaging should be considered as imaging biomarkers in clinical evaluation of the
Pan-HER mAb mixture.

target receptors individually. However, it has recently
been shown that simultaneously targeting EGFR, HER2,
and HER3 with a Pan-HER (mAb) mixture consisting
of two EGFR-, two HER2- and two HER3-targeting
mAbs with non-overlapping epitopes in a single drug
compound increases the therapeutic efficacy compared
with targeting the receptors individually [1]. Previous
studies have additionally shown that the human pancreatic

Dysregulation and overexpression of the human
epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) family and their
ligands play an important role in many cancers. The HER
family consists of four members: EGFR/HER1, ErbB2/HER2, ErbB-3/HER3, and ErbB-4/HER4. Approved

cancer cell line BxPC-3 is dependent on more than one
of the HER family members [2, 3]. Pan-HER is highly
efficacious against this cancer cell line, and all three target
specificities have been shown to contribute to the antiproliferative activity in vivo [1].
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) is frequently used for evaluation of therapeutic
response [4]. In the RECIST guidelines, evaluation of
treatment response is based on anatomical imaging with
computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), which does not give information on the
biological processes induced by the therapy. Moreover,
morphological response is a late-occurring event.
Development of predictive biomarkers of early response
to therapy has gained much interest due to both their
potential to accelerate the drug development process
and their potential to differentiate responding from nonresponding patients early after initiation of therapy.
Positron emission tomography (PET) is an imaging
technique that allows for non-invasive and longitudinal
studies of biological function in intact living organisms.
The PET tracers 2’-deoxy-2’-[18F]fluoro-D-glucose
(FDG) and 3’-deoxy-3’-[18F]fluorothymidine (FLT) are
used to measure tumor glucose uptake and tumor cell
proliferation, respectively. The glucose analogue FDG
is a widely used PET tracer for diagnosis and staging of
cancer [5]. FDG enters the cell via the same mechanism
as glucose, but once phosphorylated FDG accumulates
due to no further metabolism. The thymidine analogue
FLT enters the cells by the pyrimidine salvage pathway
and phosphorylation of FLT by thymidine kinase 1 (TK1)
results in intracellular trapping of FLT [6, 7]. Several
studies have shown a positive correlation between FLT
uptake and tumor cell proliferation [8-11]. PET imaging
with FDG and FLT has previously shown promise in
preclinical studies to monitor treatment response to
therapies targeting different members of the HER family.
Treatment of mouse models of human cancer with the
EGFR targeting mAb cetuximab induced decreases in FLT
uptake [12, 13]. Likewise, inhibition of EGFR with the
small molecule inhibitor erlotinib reduced uptake of FLT
[12, 14, 15]. Results from preclinical studies analyzing
FDG uptake after EGFR inhibition are more variable.
Following treatment initiation with erlotinib one study
observed decreases in FDG uptake [16], whereas another
study observed unchanged FDG uptake [14]. Inhibition
of several members of the HER family simultaneously
with the small molecules CI-1033 and PKI-166 induced
decreases in FDG and FLT uptake [17, 18]. In contrast,
treatment with afatinib, an inhibitor of HER1, HER2
and HER4, did not change FDG uptake [19]. In clinical
studies, early FDG and FLT PET scans have been shown
to predict progression-free survival after treatment with
erlotinib [20, 21]. Taken together, preclinical and clinical
findings provide a rationale for using FDG and FLT PET
imaging for early prediction of response to therapeutics

targeting the HER family.
Here, we investigated the ability of small animal
FDG and FLT PET/CT imaging to predict the therapeutic
response of a novel mAb mixture, Pan-HER, which
comprises two EGFR-, two HER2- and two HER3targeting mAbs. The effect of targeting all three receptors
simultaneously by Pan-HER was compared with that of
targeting each receptor individually.

RESULTS
Pan-HER inhibits tumor growth in vivo
Treatment with the different antibody mixtures was
initiated when the average tumor volume reached 200
mm3. The mean tumor volume for all groups was equal at
initiation of therapy (Figure 1B). In line with previously
reported results, the Pan-HER antibody mixture effectively
inhibited tumor growth in the BxPC-3 subcutaneous
xenograft mouse model (Figure 1C) [1]. From day 14 and
onwards, the tumor volume in the Pan-HER group was
significantly smaller (p < 0.05) than that of the control
group or any of the groups receiving antibody mixtures
targeting EGFR, HER2 or HER3 individually.

Tumor metabolism measured by FDG PET is
reduced shortly after Pan-HER therapy
Small animal PET/CT imaging with FDG was
performed on the day of initiation of therapy (day 0) and
was repeated after one treatment dose (day 1). Tumors
were FDG-positive at baseline with good tumor to normal
tissue contrast. A visual reduction in FDG uptake was
evident at day 1 compared with baseline for Pan-HER
treated animals (Figure 2A & 2B). FDGmax within the
tumor region of interests (ROIs) was 7.5 ± 0.3 percentageinjected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g) (range 4.6-12.6
%ID/g) and FDGmean uptake within the ROIs was 3.8 ± 0.1
(range 2.85-5.2 %ID/g) at baseline.
A significant (p ≤ 0.001) increase in tumor
metabolism, as measured by FDG PET, was observed for
the mice treated with vehicle (Table 1) (Figure 2C & 2D).
In contrast, a single therapeutic dose effectively reduced
tumor metabolism of the mice treated with anti-HER3 (p
≤ 0.001) and Pan-HER (p ≤ 0.01) (Table 1). No difference
in tumor metabolism was seen for the mice treated with
EGFR and HER2 antibody mixtures (Figure 2C & 2D).
Inter-group analysis of the FDGmax uptake at day
1 relative to baseline showed that one dose of Pan-HER
therapy caused a significantly greater reduction in tumor
metabolism than treatment with the vehicle (p ≤ 0.001),
EGFR (p ≤ 0.01) or HER2 (p ≤ 0.01) antibody mixtures
alone. No statistically significant difference was seen
for the mice treated with the HER3 antibody mixture vs.

the tumor ROIs. Visual comparison of the tumors at day
2 compared with baseline showed reduced FLT uptake in
mice treated with the Pan-HER antibody mixture.
One dose of therapy was able to reduce tumor
proliferation measured in vivo by FLT PET on day 2 in
the mice treated with the Pan-HER antibody mixture
compared with the baseline scan (Figure 3C & 3D). Tumor
FLT uptake was significantly reduced in the Pan-HER
group (p ≤ 0.01) while it was significantly increased in the
groups treated with vehicle (p ≤ 0.01) and anti-HER2 (p
≤ 0.01) (Table 2). No differences in FLT uptake on day 2
compared with baseline were seen in the groups receiving
the EGFR and HER3 antibody mixtures.
Non-invasive assessment of tumor proliferation
by FLT PET imaging showed that one dose of Pan-HER
reduced FLTmax uptake to 80.7% (Figure 3E & 3F) and
compared with all other groups, the relative FLTmax and
FLTmean ratios were significantly reduced (p ≤ 0.05 and p ≤
0.001, respectively).

(Figure 4G). The performance of FLT and FDG was
comparable (p ≤ 0.3). For a cut-off ratio of 0.9 we obtained
a sensitivity of 85.7% and 57.1% with a specificity of
76.9% and 96.2% for FDG and FLT, respectively.

HER family receptors are down-regulated after a
single dose of Pan-HER
In a separate experiment, vehicle and Pan-HER
treated animals (N = 5 mice/group) were euthanized
after one (day 2) and three doses (day 7) of Pan-HER
therapy to investigate the early effects of therapy on target
modulation (Figure 5) and biomarkers associated with
proliferation and glucose metabolism (Figure 6).
Tumor growth was reduced after a single dose
of Pan-HER compared to the vehicle treated group
(Supplementary Figure 2). Tumor sections stained for
EGFR, HER2 and HER3 showed markedly reduced
receptor expression after only one dose of Pan-HER
treatment compared with vehicle treated tumor sections.
No further receptor down-regulation was observed in
tumors obtained after three doses of Pan-HER treatment
(Figure 5A & 5B). In addition, Pan-HER treatment
had a profound effect on tumor histology (Figure 5C).
Compared with vehicle treated tumors, one dose of PanHER effectively reduced the area containing tumor cells,
with a resulting increase of the stromal component of the
tumor sections (Figure 5C). Similar effects were observed
for tumor sections obtained after three doses of Pan-HER
therapy.

Change in FDG and FLT uptake shortly after
therapy initiation predicts tumor growth
The change in tumor FLT and FDG uptake early
after initiation of therapy compared with baseline carries
information on future tumor growth (Figure 4). Positive
correlations were seen between the change in tumor
volume (day 23/day 0) and FDGmax (day 1/baseline), as
well as FLTmax uptake (day 2/baseline) (Figure 4A & 4B).
The correlation was slightly higher for the FDGmax ratio
(r = 0.63, p ≤ 0.001) compared with the FLTmax ratio (r =
0.53, p ≤ 0.01). Correlations between tumor volume and
FDGmean and FLTmean uptake are shown in Supplementary
Figure 1.
The change in FDGmax uptake (day 1/baseline) can
be effectively applied to stratify the tumors into subgroups
that respond to the given therapy. Tumor growth in mice
that had a tumor FDGmax ratio < 0.9 was significantly
inhibited compared with that in mice with a tumor FDGmax
ratio >0.9 (Figure 4C). Stratification on the change in FDG
uptake also resulted in improved survival (p ≤ 0.01, Logrank test), with a median survival of 39 days compared
to 26 days after initiation of therapy for the two groups
(Figure 4D).
In line with the FDG data, stratification based on
the change in FLTmax uptake (day 2/baseline) also showed
reduced tumor growth for the group of mice with FLTmax
ratio < 0.9 compared with those with a FLTmax ratio >0.9
(Figure 4E). Overall survival was also improved for the
mice with tumor FLTmax ratio < 0.9 (p ≤ 0.001, Log-rank
test), with more than 50% of the mice with a FLTmax ratio
< 0.9 being alive 50 days post therapy at the time of
censoring (Figure 4F). Receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curves were generated to investigate the accuracy
of FDG and FLT to monitor the therapeutic response
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Changes in FDG and FLT uptake are supported
by decreased expression of underlying biomarkers
after Pan-HER treatment
Protein expression of markers associated with FDG
and FLT uptake are shown in Figure 6A & 6B. For the
FDG markers, hexokinase 2 (HK2) was significantly
reduced in the Pan-HER group after both 1 (p ≤ 0.01)
and 3 doses (p ≤ 0.05) whereas glucose transporter 1
(GLUT1) was significantly reduced after 3 doses (p ≤
0.05). No difference in protein expression was observed
for hexokinase 1 (HK1). Significant down-regulation of
the proliferation markers Ki67 and thymidine kinase 1
(TK1) was observed after 1 dosage in the Pan-HER group
(p ≤ 0.05). Three doses of Pan-HER did not further downregulate the proliferation markers when analyzed by IHC.
Gene expression of GLUT1, HK2, HK2, Ki67 and
TK1 was measured on tumor samples on day 2 after one
dose of Pan-HER and compared with gene expression
in the vehicle control group. There was a clear tendency
towards down-regulation of GLUT1, Ki67 and TK1
expression in the Pan-HER group as compared to the
vehicle treated control group (Figure 6C & Table 3). In
the case of HK1 and HK2 there was a tendency towards

treatment and post-treatment FLT uptake that is predictive
of further tumor growth (Figure 4).
Only minor differences in terms of level of
significance were seen between measuring tracer uptake as
either mean or maximum tumor uptake. This underlines the
robustness of our imaging response to therapy. However,
in a clinical context maximum values are preferred and
has become the de facto standard [22]. Additionally, they
generally relate more strongly to prognosis as they reflect
the most aggressive phenotype of the tumor [23].
Decreased uptake of FDG and FLT has previously
been reported following targeting of several members of
the HER family with the small molecule inhibitors CI1033 and PKI-166 [9-11]. Those findings are in line with
the results from this study, where the Pan-HER antibody
mixture targeting EGFR, HER2 and HER3 simultaneously
decreased FDG and FLT uptake already at day 1 and 2
after treatment initiation. However, the changes in tracer
uptake following inhibition with the two small molecule
inhibitors were not observed as early as we found in the
present study. FDG uptake has furthermore been used to
evaluate patients with HER2 positive breast cancer, which
were treated with lapatinib, a clinically approved inhibitor
of EGFR as well as HER2. Pathological complete
responders had a significant larger decrease in the FDG
maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) two and
six weeks post treatment initiation compared with nonresponders [24].
The tumors in which FDG and FLT uptake
decreased the most after the first treatment dose were the
same tumors in which treatment was found to be the most
effective at the end of the study. This was demonstrated
by a relatively strong positive correlation between FDG
and FLT uptake measured after the first therapeutic dose
(day 1 and 2) and tumor volume at day 23 (Figure 4).
Accordingly, FDG and FLT uptake on day 1 and 2 was
able to predict future tumor growth. If this scenario
translates to the clinic, it implies that patients who have
the greatest decrease in FDG or FLT uptake are those in
which the treatment will be most effective. We took this
concept one step further and stratified all tumors on the
parameter FDG or FLT ratio above or below 0.9 (Figure
4E&F). It was clearly demonstrated that when individual
tumors were divided based on this parameter, both
FDG and FLT effectively stratified the population into a
group with continued tumor growth and one with tumor
regression. Survival analysis showed prolonged survival of
mice with FDG and FLT ratios < 0.9. This could translate
into stratification of responders from non-responders in the
clinical setting using a certain FDG or FLT cut-off ratio,
e.g. 0.9. Especially in the case of non-responders, this
would allow for a very early change from non-effective to
alternative therapies. It should be noted however, that the
cut-off ratio of 0.9 cannot be applied directly in a clinical
setting, but has to be established clinically for the specific
therapy and type of cancer.

DISCUSSION
Pan-HER, a mixture of three synergistic pairs
of antibodies against EGFR, HER2 and HER3, was
recently developed and demonstrated to be superior to
single receptor targeting in preclinical cancer models
[1]. However, along with the development of such new
targeting anti-cancer therapies, it is important to develop
procedures that can differentiate responders from nonresponders shortly after treatment initiation. To facilitate
translation into human use, such companion diagnostics
should preferably be non-invasive and highly sensitive.
Therefore, we have used FDG and FLT PET/CT imaging
to study the early therapeutic response to both Pan-HER
and antibody mixtures that target each of the receptors
individually.
To investigate the use of PET for assessment
of treatment effects, mice with BxPC-3 tumors were
subjected to FDG and FLT PET imaging at baseline
before Pan-HER treatment was initiated and again on
day 1 and 2, respectively, after initiation of treatment. As
shown in Figure 1C, and confirming previous findings [1],
Pan-HER was more effective for treatment of BxPC-3
xenografts than targeting either of the three HER receptors
individually. The superiority of simultaneous inhibition of
EGFR, HER2 and HER3 compared with single targeting
of these receptors was also reflected in the FDG and FLT
uptake. FDG and FLT uptake were significantly decreased
already at day 1 and 2, respectively, after a single dose in
the Pan-HER group and changes in glucose metabolism
and cell proliferation were observed before changes in
tumor volume. For comparison, the tumor volume in the
Pan-HER group was not significantly different from the
other treatment groups until day 14.
We observed that FLT uptake was further decreased
in mice receiving a single dose of Pan-HER than in
mice receiving an antibody mixture targeting any of
the individual receptors (Figure 3D & 3F). Similar
observations were made for FDG uptake, although the
differences between the Pan-HER and HER3 groups were
not significant (Figure 2D & 2F). Although the differences
in baseline FLT uptake between the groups were not
statistically significant, the baseline FLT uptake in the PanHER group was higher when compared to all the other
groups. The differences in baseline uptake were a result of
coincidence as the mice were randomized before the PET
scanning was initialized. The post-treatment (day 2) FLT
uptake in the Pan-HER group was on the same level as in
the EGFR and HER3 groups day 2 and, accordingly, no
differences in FLT uptake between the EGFR, HER3 and
Pan-HER group were observed at the post-treatment scan.
This underlines the necessity for a baseline scan of each
mouse as it is the intra-animal difference between prewww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Uptake of FDG and FLT was compared with protein
and gene expression of biomarkers related to underlying
mechanisms of FDG and FLT uptake (Figure 6).
Expression of GLUT1 has in several studies showed to be
positively correlated with FDG uptake in tumor samples
and hexokinases are responsible for the phosphorylation
and thereby intracellular trapping of FDG [25]. The FDG
uptake in tumors was decreased after treatment with one
dose of Pan-HER and we wanted to investigate if the
decrease in FDG uptake was accompanied by significant
decrease in GLUT1 and the hexokinases 1 and 2 measured
by IHC. Two days after one single dose of Pan-HER, there
was a clear tendency towards decrease in gene expression
of GLUT1 in the treatment group compared to control.
However, this change in expression of GLUT1 was not
statistically significant. Gene expression of HK1 and HK2
did not differ significantly between the Pan-HER and
control group. However, there was a trend for the gene
expression to increase in the Pan-HER treatment group
compared with the control. It should be kept in mind that
the level of mRNA does not necessarily reflect protein
expression and function [26,27] and the differences in
gene expression, protein expression, and FDG uptake
could be due to post-transcriptional and translational
modifications. Hence, the non-significant increase in
gene expression of HK1 and HK2 could be due to such
modifications or a feedback mechanism related to the PanHER treatment.
In order to evaluate the decrease in cell proliferation
measured in vivo with FLT PET, expression of the
proliferation marker Ki67 and TK1 was analyzed. Ki67
is a widely applied marker of cell proliferation and TK1
is the protein responsible for phosphorylation and thereby
intracellular trapping of FLT [25]. Protein expression of
Ki67 and TK1 were significantly decreased in the PanHER compared with the control group after one dose of
Pan-HER. Interestingly, there was no further decrease
in Ki67 and TK1 staining between tumors receiving
three doses compared with tumors receiving one dose
of Pan-HER. There was a clear trend for decreased
gene expression of both Ki67 and TK1 in the Pan-HER
compared with the control group, although this difference
was not statistically significant. The non-invasive
measurement of changes in cell proliferation by FLT PET
was thus supported by ex vivo assessment of biomarkers
related to cell proliferation, confirming that change in FLT
uptake is a measure of change in tumor cell proliferation
following Pan-HER targeting.
Expression of target receptors EGFR, HER2 and
HER3 was analyzed on day 2, after one treatment dose,
and on day 7, after three treatment doses of Pan-HER.
The expression of all three receptors EGFR, HER2 and
HER3 was significantly decreased after one dose of PanHER mixture. It has previously been shown that the PanHER mixture effectively suppresses the expression of
EGFR, HER2, and HER3 after 10 doses [1]. However,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

it is interesting that expression of target receptors was
decreased as early as two days after treatment initiation.
This confirms that a therapeutic response is measurable
at the molecular level after one dosage, and supports the
use of PET imaging with FDG and FLT for early therapy
response monitoring.
In this study of a novel Pan-HER anti-cancer
therapy, we demonstrated that early imaging with both
FDG and FLT PET could effectively predict long-term
treatment outcome. This holds great promise for clinical
translation, where FDG or FLT PET could be used as noninvasive companion diagnostics for early stratification of
patients into responders or non-responders. Especially in
case of non-response, early change of therapeutic strategy
is possible. When performing controlled randomized
clinical studies, response of FDG or FLT PET can be
used as an inclusion criterion, increasing the likelihood of
successful clinical outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and human pancreatic cancer
xenograft model
BxPC-3 cells (ATCC CRL-1687, LGC Standards)
were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin
(Invitrogen) at 37 ̊C and 5% CO2. Cells were tested
negative for mycoplasma and a panel of murine pathogens.
Cells in their exponential growth phase were harvested
by trypsinization at 80-90% confluence and resuspended
in complete medium. Tumors were generated in female
NMRI nude mice (Taconic) on the flank above the hind
limb by subcutaneous injection of 5 x 106 cells in 100 µL.
Tumor growth was monitored twice a week by caliper
measurements and tumor volume was calculated using the
formula: 0.52 x length x (width)2. All animal experiments
were performed under a protocol approved by the Danish
National Animal Experiments Inspectorate.

Pan-HER and antibodies against EGFR, HER2
and HER3
Pan-HER and the antibody pairs that comprise
the mixture were described previously [1]. All antibody
mixtures were prepared by mixing equal amounts of the
constituent antibodies.

Pan-HER therapy and small animal PET/CT
imaging
Mice were randomized into five groups (N = 8
mice/group) when the average tumor volume was 200

mm3 and therapy was initiated two days later. Antibodies
were administered intraperitoneally at 50 mg/kg total
antibody three times weekly for a total of 10 doses. The
final endpoint was survival defined by humane endpoints:
tumor mass ≥ 1g, ulceration of tumor, weight loss of more
than 10% or signs of distress.
Small animal PET/CT imaging was performed with
FLT and FDG at day -1/0 (baseline) and repeated on day
1 and 2 after initiation of therapy (Figure 1A). FDG and
FLT were acquired from daily productions for clinical use
(Rigshospitalet, Denmark).
Small animal PET imaging was performed on
a microPET Focus 120 scanner. Static images were
acquired for 480 s, 60 min after intravenous injection
of ~9.3 MBq (8.45-10.0 MBq) FDG or FLT. Animals
were anaesthetized by sevoflurane during injections and
imaging sessions. Data was acquired in list-mode and
the images were reconstructed using the 3D maximum a
posteriori algorithm with a voxel size of 0.3 x 0.3 x 0.8
mm and a spatial resolution at the center of the field of
view of 1.2 mm. No attenuation correction was applied.
CT images were acquired on a MicroCAT II
tomograph (Siemens Medical Systems) after PET imaging.
Images were acquired at 360 views with 370 ms exposure
at 500 µA and 70 kVp and reconstructed with an isotropic
voxel size of 90 µm.
All images were analyzed offline using Inveon
software (Siemens Medical Solution). PET and CT
images were co-registered and ROIs drawn over the
tumors to quantify the uptake of FDG or FLT expressed
as percentage-injected dose per gram tissue (%ID/g).
For each tumor ROI two measures were calculated:
mean uptake (FDGmean/FLTmean) and maximum uptake
(FDGmax/FLTmax) within the tumor ROIs. Survival data
was stratified on the FDGmax ratio at day 1/baseline or the
FLTmax ratio at day 2/baseline. A cut-off value of 0.9 was
chosen as a robust measure of reduced FDG or FLT uptake
at day 1 or day 2 compared to baseline. Tumor growth data
was classified as stable disease or regression if the ratio
of tumor volume at day 21/tumor volume at day 0 was
below 1.1. ROC curves were generated for the FDGmax and
FLTmax ratios.

detection of HER3. The ability of the primary antibodies
used for EGFR, HER2 and HER3 detection to stain tissue
in the presence of excess Pan-HER was verified in preblocking experiments (data not shown). GLUT1, HK1,
HK2 and TK1 were detected with primary antibodies
rabbit anti-GLUT1 (ab15309, Abcam), rabbit anti-HK1
(HPA007043, Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-HK2 (C64G5,
CST) and rabbit anti-TK1 (ab57757, Abcam) in paraffin
embedded sections. Briefly, paraffin embedded tumors
were sectioned, deparaffinized and after heat-induced
epitope retrieval all slides were blocked with Peroxidase
Blocker for 10 minutes and 2% BSA for 20 minutes before
incubation for 1 hour with primary antibody at room
temperature. All slides were incubated in EnVisionTM
System (K4003/K4001, DAKO) before DAB and
hematoxylin stainings were performed.
Assessment of general histology (judged from
hematoxylin/eosin stained slides) and IHC staining
intensity was performed in a blinded fashion. IHC staining
was analyzed in viable tumor area and scored as negative
(0), weak (1), moderate (2), or strong (3).

Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated with TRI reagent®
following the manufacturer’s instruction (Molecular
Research Center Inc.) followed by DNase treatment with
TURBO DNA-freeTM Kit (Life technologiesTM). RNA
was reversed transcribed using the Affinityscript QPCR
cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies). Primers were
designed in Beacon Designer (PREMIER Biosoft). Primer
sequences were
GLUT1-FP: 5’-catcatcttcatcccggc-3’,
GLUT1-RF: 5’-ctcctcgttgcggttgat-3’,
HK1-FP: 5’-cggggaggaaagcaaaat c-3’,

5’-ccaggctttaggtatcac-3’ and RPLP-RP:
5’ggttgtagatgctgcc-3’.
Gene expression was quantified on an Mx3005P
real-time PCR system (Stratagene) using Brilliant III
Ultra-Fast SYBR® Green QPCR Master Mix (Agilent
Technologies). The thermal profile was 3 minutes of
denaturation at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 20 seconds
denaturation at 95°C and 20 seconds of annealing/
extension at 60°C. A dissociation curve was thereafter
obtained by denaturation of the products for 1 minute

Immunohistochemistry
In a separate experiment, tumors were harvested
after one (day 2) or three (day 7) doses of Pan-HER
and immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Protein
expression was assessed in five tumors per treatment
group. The immunostaining protocol for detection of
EGFR, HER2, HER3 and Ki67 was previously described
in detail [1]. The following primary antibodies were used:
rat anti-EGFR (Abcam, clone: ICR10), rabbit anti-CErb-2 (DAKO), rabbit anti-Ki67 (Abcam). An in-house
produced antibody (mAb5259), labeled with NHSfluorescein (FITC) (Thermo scientific), was used for

at 95°C followed by data collection while temperature
increases from 55°C to 95°C. QPCR data were analyzed
in qbase+ (Biogazelle). The relative quantification of the
gene of interests was presented as fold changes in the
treatment group compared to the control group on day 2
normalized to the geometric mean of two reference genes.
The two most stable reference genes were found from a
panel of 12 candidate genes in the human reference gene
panel (TATAA Biocenter AB) using the geNorm algorithm.
