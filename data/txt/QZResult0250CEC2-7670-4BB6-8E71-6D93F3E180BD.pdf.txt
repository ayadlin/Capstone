ABSTRACT
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, and it is imperative
to develop new treatments to ameliorate patient survival. Using an anti-cancer drug
library containing 180 small molecule inhibitors, we performed a high-content imagebased screen and found that BET and MEK inhibitors are among the candidates which
were able to effectively inhibit ovarian cancer cell growth. However, BET inhibition
alone was largely cytostatic, possibly due to feedback activation of the MAPK pathway.
Consequently, the combination of MEK and BET inhibitors suppressed both cell
proliferation and survival, and was more efficacious than single agent. Mechanistically,
BET and MEK inhibitors exerted synergistic effects on apoptosis regulators including
BIM and BAD. Our findings support concomitant BET and MAPK blockade as an
effective therapeutic strategy in ovarian cancer.

INTRODUCTION

of transcriptional regulator complexes governing the
expression of key oncogenes and anti-apoptotic genes
[12, 13]. Suppression of BRD4 using specific BET
bromodomain inhibitors JQ1 or I-BET151 led to robust
and broad antitumor effects across various subtypes
of ovarian cancer. However, we discovered that BET
inhibitors mainly induce cell-cycle arrest in ovarian
cancer instead of cell apoptosis, which may limit their
clinical usage in patients with advanced ovarian cancer.
In this study, we sought to identify better drug regimens
or combinations as more effective therapeutic approaches
in ovarian cancer.
We synthesized an anti-cancer drug library
composed of both experimental compounds and early or
advanced stage clinical candidates, and performed a highcontent image-based screen in multiple ovarian cancer cell
lines. In addition to JQ1, several compounds, including

Ovarian cancer contributes to the highest mortality
among gynecological cancers [1-3]. Current standard
treatment is debulking surgery followed by taxaneplatinum chemotherapy [4]. Despite good initial
responses, almost all patients have disease recurrence
or progression [5]. As a result, the slope of survival
improvement achieved with conventional treatment has
reached a plateau, and novel targeted therapeutics are
urgently needed to improve patient outcome [6, 7].
Recently, bromodomain and extraterminal (BET)
domain protein BRD4 has been identified as a potential
therapeutic target in ovarian cancer [8]. The BET family
proteins function as epigenetic “readers” that bind the
acetylated lysine residues on histone tails [9-11], and
play a critical role in the acetylation-dependent assembly

two independent MEK inhibitors, elicited greater than
50% reduction in tumor cell growth with half maximal
inhibitory concentration (IC50) of less than 500 nM.
Interestingly, we found that BET bromodomain inhibitors
relieved feedback inhibition of the MAPK pathway
and thus caused hyperactivation of MAPK and a robust
upregulation in downstream signaling. This feedback
activation was suppressed and tumor cell inhibition was
enhanced with combined administration of BET and
MEK inhibitors, which may represent a novel therapeutic
strategy in ovarian cancer.

BET bromodomain inhibition resulted in cell
growth arrest in ovarian cancer
BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1 exhibited broad
anti-proliferative effects in a large panel of ovarian cancer
cell lines (Supplementary Table 1 and unpublished data),
without noticeable discrepancy between histological or
molecular subtypes (Supplementary Figure 1). We found
that JQ1 profoundly arrested cell-cycle without inducing
apparent apoptosis in the majority of ovarian cancer cell
lines (Figure 1A). To elaborate on this point, we grew three
ovarian cancer cell lines (ES2, OVTOKO and OVCA420)
at low or high density and treated them with JQ1. At

low cell density, JQ1 exhibited a dramatic inhibition on
tumor cell growth, while the effect was relatively modest
at high cell density (Figure 1B). We further quantified
cell growth in the presence of JQ1 at different time
points and found that JQ1 was largely a cytostatic drug
displaying anti-proliferative but not pro-apoptotic effects
on ovarian cancer cells. Indeed, although cell viability
was significantly inhibited by JQ1 treatment compared
to negative control, there was still a gradual increase of
total cell numbers across three ovarian cancer cell lines,
indicating that JQ1 did not lead to massive cell death and
cancer regression (Figure 1C). Interestingly, microarray
analysis showed that gene expression of EGR1 and FOS,
two putative targets downstream of the MAPK pathway
[14], were elevated in JQ1 treated OVTOKO cells (Figure
1D), suggesting that MAPK might be activated and played
a role in JQ1 therapy.

were effective in eliminating ovarian cancer cells in
combination with JQ1 (Figure 2D), consistent with our
observation that JQ1 treatment activated MAPK targets
EGR1 and FOS. Furthermore, we assayed a large panel
of serous and non-serous ovarian cancer cell lines and
found phospho-ERK strongly expressed in most cell
lines, indicating that the MAPK pathway was broadly
active in ovarian cancer (Figure 2E). Finally, we tested
both JQ1 and I-BET151 in combination with Trametinib in
the colony formation assay and confirmed the synergism
between BET and MEK inhibitors (Figure 2F). Thus, the
unbiased pharmacologic interrogation of ovarian cancer
cells unequivocally identified BET and MEK inhibitors as
effective drug combinations for ovarian cancer.

BET bromodomain inhibitors activated the
MAPK pathway in ovarian cancer

High-throughput drug screen identified BET and
MEK inhibitors as effective drug combination for
ovarian cancer

The synergistic effect of BET and MEK inhibitors
prompted us to further decipher the crosstalk between BET
proteins and the MAPK pathway in ovarian cancer. As
illustrated above, microarray analysis in OVTOKO cells
revealed that gene expression of EGR1 and FOS were
increased upon JQ1 treatment. Induction of these MAPK
targets correlated with decreasing levels of Sprouty1,
Spred2 and the ERK phosphatase DUSP proteins, all
of which were negative regulators of MAPK signaling
cascade [15-17] (Figure 3A). Similar results were achieved
in OVCAR3 and OVCA420 cells (Figure 3A), implying
that JQ1 activated the MAPK pathway perhaps by release
of a negative regulatory signal normally coordinating
BET and MAPK activities. Indeed, in ovarian cancer cells
treated with JQ1 or I-BET151 inhibitors, we observed a
pronounced upregulation in pERK (Figure 3B). These
data suggested a model in which BET proteins suppressed
MAPK activity. Consistently with this model, analysis
of reverse phase protein arrays (RPPA) in the cancer
genome atlas (TCGA) database revealed that ovarian
carcinomas with BRD4 amplification showed significantly
downregulated pMEK and pERK compared with those
without BRD4 amplification (Figure 3C; Supplementary
Table 3). Importantly, JQ1-induced feedback activation
of MAPK signaling as measured by EGR1 expression
was completely abrogated by the co-treatment with MEK
inhibitor Trametinib (Figure 3D).

To discover effective therapeutic strategies for
ovarian cancer, we performed an unbiased imagebased high-throughput screen in ovarian cancer cell
lines against a library of 180 anti-tumor therapeutics
spanning multiple stages of clinical development
(Supplementary Table 2). This drug panel is composed
of both chemotherapeutic medications and targeted
agents directed against a range of key regulators of cell
proliferation and survival, including oncogenic kinases,
hormone receptors, apoptosis regulators, transcription
machinery and DNA damage sensors. More than 30% of
these drugs are FDA-approved compounds and 25% have
already been in clinical trials (Figure 2A). Considering
ovarian cancer heterogeneity, four cell lines derived from
serous or non-serous ovarian carcinoma were included
in the screen. Using an image-based cell viability assay,
small-molecule drugs were initially screened at the
same concentration (500 nM) on the ovarian cancer
cells. Forty-one compounds induced more than 50%
reduction of cell density in all four cell lines and were
triaged for further inspection. To specifically identify
effective drug combinations with BET bromodomain
inhibitors, we further screened each drug in the presence
or absence of a fixed dosage of JQ1 in OVCA420 cells.
Twenty compounds resulted in a synergistic inhibition
on cell growth with JQ1 (Figure 2B). The targets of
top-ranked inhibitors spanned multiple crucial cellular
processes, such as cell proliferation (Torin 2, Abitrexate,
Pemetrexed, PD0325901, Trametinib and Neratinib), cell
cycle (Flavopiridol, LY2835219, AZD7762, LY2603618,
VE-822 and Tipifarnib), and gene transcription (AT13387,
Ganetespib, JQ1 and Trichostatin A) (Figure 2C). Notably,

The molecular mechanisms underlying the
synergistic effects of BET and MAPK inhibitors were
investigated in ovarian cancer. We reasoned that besides
the cytostatic effects of BET inhibitors as single agent,
the combination therapy might additionally promote cell
apoptosis. Exposure to JQ1 and Trametinib dramatically

inhibitors suppressed ovarian tumor growth in

accelerated apoptosisas indicated by cleaved PARP [18]
and cleaved Caspase 3 [19], compared to individual
treatment (Figure 4A). Substantial induction of apoptosis
was observed in all four cell lines treated with JQ1 and
Trametinib, as assessed by both caspase 3/7 activity
(Figure 4B) and Annexin V cytometry (Figure 4C;
Supplementary Figure 2). Mechanistically, concurrent
JQ1 and Trametinib treatment induced upregulation of
pro-apoptotic BIM [20] and reduction of anti-apoptotic
phospho-BAD [21] (Figure 4D). Taken together, we
concluded that BET and MEK inhibitors synergistically
elicited tumor cell apoptosis by coordinately regulating
apoptosis molecules including BIM and BAD.

To explore the in vivo anti-tumor effect of BET and
MEK inhibitors in ovarian cancer, we subcutaneously
transplanted ES2 cells into nude mice. We started to treat
nude mice with indicated drugs when the tumor volume
reached about 200 mm3. After eight days of treatment, we
observed significant decrease of tumor volume and tumor
weight in xenografts treated with JQ1 and Trametinib
polytherapy, compared with vehicle or either drug alone
(Figure 5A-5C). Mice weights were monitored to evaluate
the possible overt systemic toxicity of combination

therapy. Notably, a moderate but significant weight loss
was observed upon multiple doses of dual treatment
(Figure 5D), suggesting that toxicity might be a doselimiting factor and needs to be thoroughly investigated
before testing the regimens in patients. Nevertheless,
concomitant BET and MAPK blockade was generally

tolerable and highly effective as a potential therapeutic
strategy of ovarian cancer.

We and others have discovered BET bromodomain

inhibition as a new treatment approach against ovarian
cancer. However, BET bromodomain inhibitors mainly
induce cell-cycle arrest, but not apoptosis in ovarian
cancer cells, which is likely a potential obstacle of their
application in treating ovarian cancer patients. In this
study, we identified previously undescribed BET and
MEK inhibitor combination as an effective therapeutic
strategy in ovarian cancer using an unbiased smallmolecule screen platform. BET and MEK inhibitors
not only arrested cell growth but also synergistically
elicited tumor cell apoptosis, presumably by coordinately
regulating apoptosis proteins such as BIM and BAD.
Hence, we addressed a high unmet therapeutic need for
the treatment of ovarian cancer. It is noteworthy that
our chemical screen also uncovered other inhibitors as
promising drug candidates to be combined with BET
bromodomain inhibitors. These included multiple CHK

inhibitors and Aurora Kinase inhibitors, and warrant
further investigations.
A novel finding of our study is the coupling of
BET inhibition and MAPK activation and the intimate
interaction between the two pathways. It is a common
theme that complex networks of negative-feedback
interactions exist in tumor cells and result in adaptive
resistance upon targeted drug treatment [22]. For example,
activated MAPK signaling induces the expression of
many genes that paradoxically inhibit activation of the
pathway. Of these, dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs)
proteins dephosphorylate ERK [23], and Sprouty/Spred
proteins act through suppressing the upstream activation
of RAS by various receptor tyrosine kinases [15, 24, 25].
Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of MAPK signaling
relieves MAPK-dependent feedback inhibition of DUSP
and Sprouty/Spred proteins, followed by induction of

RAS activation and rebound of MAPK pathway [26, 27].
Interestingly, we found that negative-feedback regulators
of MAPK signaling including DUSP and Sprouty/
Spred proteins were also transcriptionally controlled by
BET bromodomain proteins, such that BET inhibition
relieved this feedback, resulting in the hyperactivation
of MAPK and an attenuation of the antitumor effects of
BET bromodomain inhibitors. Therefore, the adaptive
resistance to BET inhibitors can be, at least partially,
overcome by co-administration of MEK inhibitors.
In summary, we revealed MAPK pathway activation
as a cell-protective feedback mechanism that is triggered
by BET bromodomain inhibition in ovarian cancer cells.
Disruption of this feedback loop rendered cells susceptible
to apoptosis and sensitized tumors to BET inhibitors. We
envision that these discoveries will be generalizable to
other solid and liquid tumor malignancies. Considering
that both BET and MEK inhibitors are currently being
actively evaluated for the treatment of various cancers as
single agents in different stages of clinical trials (www.
clinicaltrials.gov), our findings advocate a therapeutic
strategy to potentially improve the efficacy by combining
both agents that can disrupt the anticipated feedback
activation in these tumors.

to polyvinylidenediﬂuoride membranes. The membranes
were blocked with 5% non-fat milk in TBST and
incubated with speciﬁc primary antibodies. Detection was
performed using SuperSignal WestPico chemiluminescent
substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc) followed by exposure to

RNA was prepared with RNeasy plus mini kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
Total RNA was subjected to microarray analysis using
Affymetrix human genome U133 Plus 2.0. Three
biological replicates per treatment group were included
for statistical analyses. Affymetrix microarray probe-level
data were normalized by Robust Multi-array Average
(RMA) procedure. Differential gene expression was
analyzed with linear models for microarray data (Limma).
TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems)
were performed to verify the microarray results. Relative
expression levels of each gene were normalized to human
beta-actin. At least three biological replicates were
included for each condition.
