Abstract
Immunotherapy with rituximab alone or in conjunction with
chemotherapy has significantly improved the treatment
outcome of B-cell lymphoma patients. Nevertheless, a subpopulation of patients does not respond to rituximab. The
reason for treatment failure as well as the exact mechanism of
action is still uncertain. The function of rituximab has long
been associated with the partitioning of CD20 molecules to
lipid microdomains. We now show that the extent of CD20
recruitment to lipid rafts correlates with response to
rituximab. In addition, expression of the raft-associated
sphingolipid GM1 on lymphoma cells is associated with the
susceptibility of lymphoma cells to rituximab. Furthermore,
we show substantially different GM1 expression in various
primary non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Whereas chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells have a low GM1 expression,
marginal zone lymphoma cells exhibit much higher levels.
Differences were not only detected among various lymphoma
subgroups but also within one lymphoma subtype. Interestingly, whereas CLL cells from patients with high GM1
expression responded to rituximab, patients with low GM1
expressing CLL cells did not. These data show the importance
of membrane microdomains in the effect of rituximab and
may offer a predictive factor for the responsiveness of
lymphoma cells to rituximab. [Cancer Res 2008;68(13):5414–22]

Introduction
The monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab directed against the
cell-surface molecule CD20 of mature B cells has been proven to
be successful in the treatment of a variety of B-cell malignancies
(1–4). However, resistance against rituximab occurs and there is
no prognostic marker to predict individual response (5).
Rituximab has been shown to induce cell killing via antibodydependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC; ref. 6), complementdependent cytotoxicity (CDC; refs. 7, 8), and the induction of
apoptosis (9, 10). However, the mechanism that renders rituximab
very effective in vivo remains elusive. Some reports suggest CDC
to be the major pathway that is used by rituximab to deplete
human lymphoma cells in vitro and in vivo (11). On the other
hand, expression of the complement inhibitors CD46, CD55, and
CD59 did not predict treatment outcome (12). Other reports have
proposed that the activity of rituximab in vivo depends on its
interaction with immune cells, in particular through ADCC and

phagocytosis (6, 13, 14). The fact that FcgRIIIa polymorphisms
have been shown to be predictive for tumor clearance in follicular
lymphomas supports the importance of ADCC in the action of
rituximab (15).
Several studies have addressed the question whether CD20
expression level may be used to predict progression of disease and
response to treatment with rituximab. This would be very
suggestive especially for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),
characterized by a low CD20 expression level and a general weak
response to rituximab (8). However, in vivo studies with anti-CD20
antibodies showed no correlation between the density of CD20
molecules on the cell surface and response to rituximab (16). Thus,
no reliable prognostic factor for the susceptibility of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphoma to rituximab exists thus far.
On the molecular level, membrane microdomains have been
shown to be associated with the function of rituximab. Binding of
rituximab causes a rapid redistribution of CD20 molecules to
detergent-resistant membranes termed lipid rafts (7). These
specialized microdomains of the plasma membrane are highly
enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol (17). Membraneassociated events are involved in several biological cell functions
such as cell signaling, cell adhesion, and protein sorting. Gangliosides are sialic acid–containing glycosphingolipids that are
constituents of mammalian cell membranes. Increasing evidence
suggests that gangliosides are not passive structural components of
cell membranes but rather act as modulators for important
biological processes such as proliferation, adhesion, differentiation,
and inflammation (18–22). Furthermore, it has been shown that
gangliosides play an important role in the formation and
stabilization of lipid rafts (23, 24).
The ganglioside GM1 is widely used as a marker for lipid rafts
(25, 26). In the present study, we analyzed the expression of GM1 in
various non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Moreover, we asked whether
differences in the GM1 expression of lymphoma cells influence
CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts and, thus, the susceptibility of nonHodgkin’s lymphomas to rituximab. Analyzing the GM1 expression
level of more than 200 patient samples revealed a significant
difference in the expression between various lymphoma subtypes.
The different GM1 expression directly correlated with the
responsiveness of lymphoma cells to rituximab. Whereas CLL
and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cells with high GM1 expression
responded to rituximab ex vivo, low GM1 expressing lymphoma
cells did not.

GM1 Determines Response to Rituximab
Cell lines were obtained from American Type Culture Collection or
Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen and were
maintained in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL
penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L -glutamine, and 0.05 mmol/L
2-mercaptoethanol (Invitrogen).
Human mAbs anti-CD10-PECy5, anti-CD20-PECy7, anti-CD20-PE, antiCD23-PE, anti-FMC-7-FITC, anti-CD5-FITC, anti-CD38-PECy5, anti-n-FITC,
anti-E-PE, anti-CD19-ECD, and appropriate isotype controls were purchased from Beckmann-Coulter. Cholera toxin subunit B-FITC was
purchased from Molecular Probes.
Flow cytometric analysis. Peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirates
were anticoagulated with sodium heparin. Further processing was done
within 24 h. For lysis, 300 AL of bone marrow or 300 AL of peripheral blood
were lysed with 2 mL of Versa-Lysis (Coulter) in rotating tubes for 10 min.
After washing, cells were stained for CD19, CD20, CD5, CD23, CD38, FMC7,
CD10, n, E, and GM1 with three 5-color combinations and analyzed by flow
cytometry with the use of a Coulter Cytomic FC 500. The GM1 expression
level in granulocytes was used as a staining control because GM1 was
comparably expressed in granulocytes from different patients (data not
shown). To determine the GM1 expression level of lymphoma cells in the
same tube, separate gates were set on CD19-positive lymphoma cells and
CD45int granulocytes. Depicted is the ratio of GM1 expression in lymphoma
cells relative to granulocytes.
Cells from cell culture were washed in PBS containing 2% FCS and
incubated with saturating amounts of fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies.
After 30 min at 4jC, cells were washed with PBS/2% FCS and analyzed by
flow cytometry with the use of a Coulter Cytomic FC 500 cytofluorometer.
Culture conditions of cell lines. Lymphoma cells were cultured in RPMI
1640, supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin,
2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 0.05 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (all from Life
Technologies, Inc./Invitrogen). All tissue culture experiments were done in
a fully humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37jC. Cells were plated
at 100,000 in a total volume of 200 AL in 96-well dishes and were grown for
1 to 3 d.
Isolation of B-cell CLL and MCL samples by immunomagnetic
separation. After informed consent was obtained, peripheral blood was
collected from patients with confirmed B-cell CLL (B-CLL) and MCL
according to morphologic and immunophenotypic criteria. Patients were
either untreated or had not received cytoreductive chemotherapy for at
least 3 mo before blood collection. At the time of analysis, all patients were
free of infectious complications.
Enrichment of B-CLL and MCL cells by immunomagnetic sorting has
been described (27). In brief, mononuclear cells were first enriched by
density gradient centrifugation over a Ficoll-Hypaque layer, and then
T lymphocytes and monocytes were depleted with immunomagnetic
microbeads. As assessed by flow cytometry, the content of monoclonal
CD19+ B cells was >95% in all immunoseparated samples. Cells were used
immediately for further experiments.
Culture conditions for primary lymphoma cells. B-CLL or MCL
cells were cultured in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 30% autologous
serum, 50 IU/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and
0.05 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies/Invitrogen). All tissue
culture experiments were done in a fully humidified atmosphere with 5%
CO2 at 37jC. Cells were plated at 500,000 in a total volume of 200 AL in
96-well dishes and were grown for 48 h. It should be noted that, in
addition to rituximab-mediated cell death, spontaneous cell death was
observed in all cultured CLL samples. Especially in CLL cells cultured
with medium and serum alone, the spontaneous cell death was high. To
rescue CLL cells from spontaneous cell death, cells were stimulated with
the CpG oligonucleotide DSP30 (2 Amol/L) and IL-2 (100 units/mL;
ref. 27).
Inhibition of functional rafts using methyl-B-cyclodextrin. Cells were
incubated for 30 min with 10 mmol/L methyl-h-cyclodextrin (MhCD;
Sigma). After addition of rituximab in the concentration indicated, cells
were incubated for 30 min at 37jC. After three washing steps, cells were
incubated for 1 to 3 d and analyzed for the number of viable cells by 3-(4,5dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTS) assay.

Inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis. To inhibit GlcCer synthesis, the
lymphoma cell line Nceb was cultured in the presence of 30 Amol/L D-threo1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (PDMP; Calbiochem)
for 5 d (28).
Rituximab-mediated cytotoxicity assays. For rituximab-mediated cell
death (apoptosis and CDC), 1  106 cells were resuspended in 300 AL of
human serum (non–heat inactivated) and 700 AL of culture medium with or
without 100 Ag/mL rituximab at 37jC for 24 h. Dead and viable cells were
discriminated by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining.
Annexin V/PI staining. Cells (1  105) were washed and resuspended in
binding buffer [10 mmol/L HEPES (pH 7.4), 140 mmol/L NaCl, and
2.5 mmol/L CaCl2] containing 1 Ag/mL FITC-Annexin V. PI (1.25 Ag/mL)
was also added to the samples to distinguish between early apoptosis and
secondary necrosis. Subsequently, cells were assessed by flow cytometry.
MTS assay. B cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies/
Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (PAA) or 30% autologous serum,
50 IU/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine, and 0.05 mmol/L
2-mercaptoethanol (Life Technologies/Invitrogen). All tissue culture experiments were done at 37jC and 5% CO2 in a fully humidified atmosphere in
96-well plates at 1  105 cells (cell lines) or 5  105 primary lymphoma cells
in a total volume of 200 AL for 1 to 3 d. At the end of the culture period, a
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay was done: 40 AL of a combined
MTS/phenazine methosulfate solution (Promega) were added, and the
absorbance at 490 nm (A 490) was determined using an ELISA reader. Mean
values were calculated from triplicate cultures. Data from individual
experiments are presented as mean F SD. We confirmed our results with
the trypan blue exclusion method in two independent samples.
Purification of raft fractions. Purification of raft fractions has been
described (29). Cells (3  107) were lysed on ice in 1 mL of 1% Triton in
MNE buffer [25 mmol/L MES (pH 6.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L EDTA,
50 mmol/L NaF, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mg/mL each
of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin and the protease inhibitor mix
Complete Mini (Roche)], dounced 10 times, and mixed with 1 mL of 85%
sucrose made with MNE buffer. After transfer of the lysate to the centrifuge
tube, 2 mL of 35% sucrose in MNE buffer were overlaid, then 1 mL of 5%
sucrose in MNE was overlaid. After centrifugation for 3.30 h at 200,000  g
in a Beckman SW50.1 rotor, 400-AL fractions were collected from the top of
the gradient. Protein concentration of each fraction was determined with
the Bio-Rad protein assay kit, which is based on the Bradford dye binding
procedure. Fractions were pooled or analyzed individually by SDS-PAGE
and Western blotting.
Western blotting. Western blot analysis was done with the indicated
antibodies following SDS-PAGE and transfer onto nitrocellulose paper
(Schleicher and Schuell). They were hybridized with antibodies to CD20
(Novocastra), lyn (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), cholera toxin subunit B-HRP
(Calbiochem), caspase-3 (Cell Signaling), and caspase-8 (R&D). All
immunoblots were developed with the ECL system (Pierce).

Results
Rituximab mediates cell death in Nceb cells but not in DB
cells. Rituximab has been shown to induce cell death in lymphoma
cells via CDC, ADCC, and induction of apoptosis. However,
resistance to rituximab occurs in vitro and in vivo. We investigated
four different mantle cell, three diffuse large cell, two CLL, and two
Burkitt lymphoma cell lines for their response to rituximab
(Table 1). Rituximab-mediated cell death (apoptosis and CDC)
was determined in the presence of non–heat-inactivated serum
from a healthy donor. Lymphoma cells were incubated in the
absence or presence of rituximab for 24 hours. Cell death was
assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis
using Annexin V/PI staining. The results of two exemplary cell
lines, the MCL cell line Nceb and the diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
cell line DB, are depicted in Fig. 1. Nceb cells, but not DB cells, died
after rituximab treatment. The antilymphoma effect of rituximab in

NOTE: Surface expression of CD20 and GM1 of various cell lines was measured by FACS as described in Fig. 3. Susceptibility to rituximab of each cell
line was determined. Cells were treated with 100 Ag/mL rituximab for 24 h. Cells (105) in triplicates were used in a standard MTS assay. The number
of +’s signifies CD20 and GM1 surface expression. Cells were judged to be insensitive ( ; induction of apoptosis <5%), weakly sensitive (+; induction of
apoptosis <10%), moderately sensitive (++; induction of apoptosis <20%), or very sensitive (+++; induction of apoptosis >20%) based on the results of
FACS analysis.

Nceb cells was dose dependent. Incubating Nceb cells with
increasing concentrations of rituximab led to an increase in
rituximab-mediated cell death (Fig. 1B). In contrast, no cytotoxic
effect, even at 100 Ag/mL rituximab, was observed in the DB
cell line.
Lipid rafts are crucial for rituximab-mediated cell death.
Rituximab has been shown to recruit CD20 molecules into lipid
rafts (7). Moreover, it has been discussed whether CD20
recruitment to lipid rafts is essential for rituximab-mediated cell
death. Because the two cell lines, DB and Nceb, responded
differently to rituximab treatment, we asked whether the difference
in response could be due to differences in CD20 raft recruitment.
We isolated lipid rafts from Nceb and DB cells by sucrose gradient
centrifugation. The raft fractions ( fractions 1–4) and nonraft
fractions ( fractions 8–11) were pooled and subjected to Western
blot analysis. The tyrosine kinase Lyn, known to be constitutively
expressed in lipid rafts, served as a control (30). Both unstimulated
DB and unstimulated Nceb cells did not exhibit any raft-associated
CD20. Interestingly, within 5 minutes of rituximab treatment, Nceb
cells showed a robust recruitment of CD20 molecules to lipid rafts.
In contrast, little CD20 recruitment was observed in the rituximabresistant DB cell line (Fig. 2A). We next asked if the recruitment of
CD20 in Nceb cells to lipid rafts would be necessary for cell killing.
For this purpose, we investigated the effect of MhCD on the
survival of Nceb cells after rituximab treatment. MhCD inhibits the
function of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion (17). Nceb cells were
incubated with 10 mmol/L MhCD for 30 minutes. Cells were then
treated with rituximab or untreated. After 24 hours, the percentage
of viable cells was determined by MTS assay (Fig. 2B). On rituximab
treatment, a decrease in viable cells of >50% was observed. This
apoptotic effect was completely abolished by preincubation with
MhCD. Therefore, the recruitment of CD20 to lipid microdomains
on rituximab treatment is an initial event that is crucial for
rituximab-mediated cell death.
To confirm the effect of MhCD on the molecular level, we
analyzed the rituximab-mediated CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts in

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (13). July 1, 2008

the presence of MhCD. As expected, MhCD treatment inhibited the
rituximab-mediated raft recruitment of CD20 (Fig. 2C).
Rituximab has been shown to induce cell killing by the
induction of apoptosis (10, 11). Because CD20 was recruited to
membrane microdomains after rituximab treatment in the
susceptible Nceb cells, we next asked whether caspases, mediators
of the apoptosis pathway, are also recruited to this membrane
compartment. Rituximab-susceptible Nceb and rituximab-resistant
DB cells were treated with rituximab and raft fractions were
isolated. Interestingly, procaspase-8 and procaspase-3 recruitment
to lipid rafts was only observed in the susceptible Nceb cell line
but not in the rituximab-resistant DB cells (Fig. 2D), indicating
the importance of this molecular event in rituximab-mediated
cell death.
GM1 expression correlates with susceptibility of lymphoma
cells to rituximab in vitro. The expression of CD20 molecules on
lymphoma cells is still discussed as being involved in the
responsiveness to rituximab. To test the hypothesis that CD20
expression levels are responsible for differences in CD20 recruitment and, subsequently, altered responsiveness to rituximab, we
measured the CD20 expression levels by FACS analysis. Compared
with Nceb cells, DB cells showed a significantly higher CD20
expression (Fig. 3A), although they did not respond to rituximab
treatment. Because differences in CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts
correlated with response to rituximab, we next asked whether
differences in the expression of the raft-associated ganglioside GM1
could be observed between the two cell lines. Nceb cells exhibited
a substantially higher GM1 expression compared with DB cells
(Fig. 3A). To confirm the hypothesis that GM1 expression correlates
with sensitivity to rituximab, we investigated GM1 and CD20
expression in those cell lines, in which the response to rituximab
was initially investigated (Table 1). No correlation between CD20
expression and sensitivity to rituximab was observed. In contrast,
GM1 expression and response to rituximab correlated in all the
B-cell lymphoma cell lines investigated. To further show the
importance of GM1 expression in rituximab-mediated cell death,

GM1 Determines Response to Rituximab

Nceb cells were treated with the glycosphingolipid synthesis
inhibitor PDMP. It has been shown that PDMP down-regulates
sphingolipid expression (31). Treatment of Nceb cells with the
sphingolipid inhibitor PDMP resulted in a marked reduction in
GM1 expression as compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3B).
Analyzing the effect of rituximab-mediated cell death in PDMPtreated Nceb cells, a significant decrease in susceptibility to
rituximab-mediated cell death was observed (Fig. 3C). After
rituximab treatment of non–PDMP-treated Nceb cells, <30% of
the cells were viable. In contrast, PDMP treatment antagonized the
function of rituximab-mediated cell death. Almost 50% of the cells
were alive after rituximab treatment. Thus, alterations in GM1
expression directly influence the susceptibility of lymphoma cells
to rituximab-mediated cell death.
GM1 expression varies in primary lymphoma cells. It is well
known that the effect of rituximab differs in various nonHodgkin’s lymphoma subtypes. For example, CLL cells exhibit a
lower sensitivity to rituximab than marginal zone lymphomas.

Figure 1. Rituximab-mediated apoptosis and CDC in the Nceb cell line but not
in the DB cell line. A, the MCL cell line Nceb and the diffuse large B-cell
lymphoma cell line DB were treated with 100 Ag/mL rituximab for 24 h or left
untreated in the presence of 30% non–heat-inactivated human serum from a
healthy donor. Cells were analyzed by FACS analysis with a standard Annexin V/
PI staining. B, DB and Nceb cells were incubated with various concentrations
of rituximab (0, 0.01, 1, and 100 Ag/mL) in the presence of 30% non–heatinactivated serum from a healthy donor. Cells (105) in triplicates were used in a
standard MTS assay. Points, mean; bars, SD.

Because we observed a correlation between susceptibility to
rituximab and GM1 expression in various lymphoma cell lines, we
asked whether this could also be observed in primary lymphoma
cells. To this end, we analyzed the GM1 expression of lymphoma
cells from a total of 217 patients with indolent lymphomas. FACS
analysis of GM1 in CD19+ lymphoma cells was done from blood
and bone marrow. Figure 4A indicates the number of patients
with different lymphomas analyzed. CLL samples accounted for
>50% of all patient samples. GM1 levels of B-cell lymphomas from
34 marginal zone lymphomas, 20 follicular lymphomas, 11
immunocytomas, and 22 MCLs were analyzed by FACS staining.
Figure 4B shows the GM1 expression of a typical patient with CLL,
MCL, and marginal zone lymphoma in a histogram. The patient
with CLL exhibited a much lower GM1 level than did the patient
with MCL or marginal zone lymphoma. The average GM1
expression levels of all 217 patients analyzed are shown in
Fig. 4A. Interestingly, there was a significant difference in GM1
expression between most non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subgroups as
determined by Student’s t test (GM1 expression CLL/follicular
lymphoma, P = 0.014). Of note, differences were also observed
within the subgroup of patients with CLL, with some patients
exhibiting high levels and some with low GM1 expression levels
(data not shown; Fig. 5A). The analysis of polyclonal B cells
revealed a GM1 expression that was distinct from the expression
of monoclonal B cells in most of the samples analyzed. The
average GM1 expression of polyclonal B cells from 15 healthy
donors indicated expression levels that were higher than those of
CLL, follicular lymphoma, and immunocytoma, but lower than
those of MCL and marginal zone lymphoma (Fig. 4A).
GM1 expression in CLL and MCL cells correlates with
susceptibility to rituximab. Because different GM1 expression
levels were detected in the 122 CLL patients tested, we asked
whether differences in response to rituximab could be observed in
dependence on the GM1 status. Samples from 14 CLL patients
were analyzed by flow cytometry for the expression of the CD20
antigen and the sphingolipid GM1. In Fig. 5A, the CD20 and GM1
expression levels of the 14 patients analyzed are documented.
The induction of apoptosis by rituximab was investigated after
48 hours by Annexin V/PI staining and MTS assay (Fig. 5B; data not
shown). The antileukemic effect of rituximab strongly correlated
with GM1 expression because only those CLL cells with a high GM1
expression level responded to rituximab. In contrast, CLL cells with
low GM1 expression showed only little, if any, susceptibility to
rituximab (Fig. 5B). No correlation between response to rituximab
and CD20 expression was observed (Fig. 5A and B).
Due to limited case numbers of leukemic MCL, we had access
to samples from two patients. Blood samples from these two
patients were immunoseparated to >95% purity based on the
content of monoclonal CD19+ B cells. Again, cells were analyzed by
flow cytometry for the expression of the CD20 antigen and the
sphingolipid GM1. Both samples exhibited a comparable CD20
expression, whereas patient 2 displayed a much higher expression
level for GM1 (Fig. 5C). MCL cells were cultured in the absence or
presence of rituximab. After 48 hours, apoptotic cells were
determined by FACS using Annexin V/PI staining and MTS assay.
Although CD20 was expressed comparably, MCL cells derived from
patient one did not respond to rituximab treatment, whereas
f50% of the cells from patient 2 died (Fig. 5D). These results
suggest that GM1 expression, rather than CD20 expression,
correlates with responsiveness to rituximab in further types of
non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.

Discussion
In the present study, we show that expression of the
sphingolipid GM1 correlates with response to rituximab in
various non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas. Furthermore, not only
in vitro expression but also ex vivo GM1 expression differs
between various lymphoma subtypes and, more importantly, even
within one lymphoma subgroup. Analysis of apoptosis induction
in CLL and MCL cells revealed that only lymphoma cells with
high GM1 expression, but not low expressing lymphoma cells,
responded to rituximab (Fig. 5B and D). On the molecular level,
susceptibility of lymphoma cells to rituximab correlated with the
recruitment of CD20 and procaspase-8 and procaspase-3
molecules to lipid rafts. Together, these data may offer a predictive factor for the treatment response of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphomas to rituximab.

Although antibody-induced CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts is
documented, the importance of this molecular event is still
uncertain. Whereas complement-mediated lysis by anti-CD20
mAbs was shown to correlate with the segregation into lipid rafts,
the same group reported that CD20-induced lymphoma cell death
was independent of raft redistribution (7, 32). However, these
observations were made using different CD20 antibodies. In
contrast to the anti-CD20 mAb B1, rituximab treatment resulted
in CD20 raft recruitment. The rituximab-induced raft recruitment
of CD20 was accompanied by CDC-mediated eradication of
lymphomas. In contrast, no CDC-mediated cell death was observed
on treatment with the anti-CD20 mAb B1 (7). Thus, different CD20
antibodies have different effects on the molecular level in vitro and
in vivo (33, 34). Therefore, studies using rituximab are necessary to
explain the mechanism of lymphoma eradication in patients.

Figure 2. Lipid rafts are crucial for rituximabmediated cell death. A, DB and Nceb cells
(3  107) were incubated with 100 Ag/mL rituximab
for 5 and 20 min or left untreated. Cells were lysed
and sucrose gradient fractions were prepared as
described (31). Raft fractions 1 to 4 and nonraft
fractions 8 to 11 were pooled and separated
by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was done with
anti-CD20 and anti-Lyn specific mAbs. B, Nceb cells
were incubated for 30 min with 10 mmol/L MhCD.
After addition of 100 Ag/mL rituximab, cells were
incubated for 30 min at 37jC. After washing thrice
with medium, cells were incubated for 24 h. Cells
(105) in triplicates were used in a standard MTS

GM1 Determines Response to Rituximab

recruitment to lipid rafts was also observed only in rituximabsusceptible Nceb cells but not in the resistant DB cell line. The fact
that molecules of the apoptosis pathway are selectively recruited to
membrane microdomains following rituximab treatment offers
new insights into the mechanism of rituximab-mediated cell death
and highlights the importance of the induction of apoptosis.
Recently, it has been shown that rituximab results in a rapid and
transient increase in acid sphingomyelinase activity and concomitant cellular ceramide generation induced in rituximab-sensitive
cell lines (35). The fact that most acid sphingomyelinase activity
was contained in lipid rafts supports the importance of membrane
microdomains in rituximab-mediated cell death. Furthermore,
inhibition of caspase-8 using carbobenzoxy-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone inhibits ceramide formation and subsequent apoptosis
(36). This underlines the necessity of CD20 and procaspase8 recruitment to lipid rafts for rituximab-mediated cell death.
Together, these data suggest that the recruitment of the deathinducing signaling complex as indicated by caspase-8 recruitment
to lipid rafts is an early event that mediates rituximab-induced cell
death. In case of raft recruitment of the death-inducing signaling
complex (rituximab-susceptible cells), downstream signaling events
such as caspase-3 activation, acid sphingomyelinase activity, and
ceramide release are initiated.
The importance of CD20 raft recruitment was further documented by the use of the raft-inhibiting detergent MhCD. When
Nceb cells were treated with rituximab in the presence of MhCD,

Figure 3. GM1 expression, but not CD20 expression, correlates with
susceptibility of lymphoma cell lines to rituximab. A, surface expression of
CD20 and GM1 on DB and Nceb cells was determined by FACS. Cells
(1  106) were stained with 1 Ag of anti-CD20 mAb-PE (IgG1 subtype; solid black
lines), isotype control (pure IgG1; gray lines ), or 1 Ag of cholera toxin subunit
B-FITC, and then analyzed by FACS. B, Nceb cells were treated with PDMP
(30 Amol/L) or left untreated. GM1 expression was measured by FACS as
described in A. C, PDMP-treated and untreated Nceb cells were incubated with
100 Ag/mL rituximab for 24 h or left untreated, as indicated, in the presence
of 30% non–heat-inactivated human serum. Cells were analyzed by FACS
analysis with a standard Annexin V/PI staining.

As shown by previous studies, rituximab treatment results in
CD20 recruitment to lipid microdomains. With the two exemplary
two cell lines, which respond differently to rituximab, we show that
the amount of CD20 recruitment to lipid rafts is crucial for the
effect of rituximab. In the rituximab-resistant cell line DB, only a
small amount of CD20 was recruited to lipid rafts, whereas in the
rituximab-sensitive cell line Nceb, CD20 was recruited substantially
to lipid rafts (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, procaspase-8 and procaspase-3

no raft recruitment was observed and neither CDC nor apoptosis
was induced (Fig. 2B and C). This documents the necessity of CD20
raft recruitment for the function of rituximab, at least for CDC and
induction of apoptosis. Monovalent Fab fragments of rituximab
have also been shown to be sufficient to recruit CD20 molecules to
lipid rafts (37). This emphasizes that cross-linking of two adjacent
epitopes by rituximab is not necessary for CD20 raft recruitment.
Moreover, these data suggest that Fab fragments stabilize a
conformation of CD20 that exhibits a higher affinity for rafts.
The higher-affinity association of CD20 to rafts might create a
suitable environment for CD20 activation, providing close proximity to raft-localized kinases (38).
Using non–heat-inactivated serum from a healthy donor, we are
able to detect CDC and apoptosis, but not ADCC. The major effect
of CDC and apoptosis compared with ADCC for rituximabmediated cell death has been shown by Di Gaetano and colleagues.
In their study, rituximab prevented death in all mice treated with
rituximab after i.v. inoculation of the murine T lymphoma cell line
EL4 retrovirally transfected with the human CD20 cDNA. The
depletion of natural killer cells, mononuclear cells, and T cells did
not affect the therapeutic effect of rituximab (11). Therefore, at
least in this system, ADCC was dispensable for the function of
rituximab. In contrast, Clynes and colleagues suggest that ADCC is
the central effector mechanism of rituximab. In a s.c. xenograft
model of lymphoma, the FcRg chain necessary for signaling from
the activating FcgRI and FcgRIII receptors, present on the surface
of macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells, has been
shown to be required for the full therapeutic activity of rituximab
(6). One explanation for the differences observed in the two models
could be the use of different lymphoma cells. It is also possible that
the site of the tumor determines the mechanism by which
rituximab can kill tumor cells. It might be possible that effector
cells invade solid lymphoid tumors and kill lymphoma cells.
Leukemic or hypervasculated tumors might be more susceptible to
CDC. Both mechanisms, the intrinsic properties of different B cells
and their localization within a protective microenvironment, have
been shown to play a role in the susceptibility of non-Hodgkin’s
lymphomas in vivo (39).
Our data provide evidence for a predictive factor for the
response of lymphoma cells to rituximab. Starting with the
observation that CD20 raft recruitment is a key event following
rituximab treatment, we correlated the amount of raft-translocated
CD20 with response. Whereas recruitment of CD20 to lipid rafts
was in line with treatment response, cell-surface expression levels
of CD20 showed no correlation. Interestingly, the expression levels
of the ganglioside GM1, widely used as a marker for lipid rafts,
correlated with response to rituximab (Table 1). The importance of
GM1 expression was further underlined by inhibiting the
sphingolipid synthesis in Nceb cells. This resulted in a reduced
GM1 expression and, subsequently, in a marked reduction of
rituximab-mediated cell death (Fig. 3B and C). Therefore, the
observed decrease in rituximab susceptibility is due to a direct
reduction in GM1 expression. Gangliosides are not passive
structural components of cell membranes. It has been shown that
they modulate important biological processes such as proliferation,
adhesion, differentiation, and inflammation (18–22). Furthermore,
gangliosides play an important role in the formation and
stabilization of lipid membrane microdomains. The reduced
rituximab-induced CD20 recruitment in the low-expressing DB
cell line suggests a role for the ganglioside GM1 in raft formation
(Fig. 2A).

rituximab. B cells from 14 patients with CLL and 2 patients with leukemic
MCL were isolated as described. CD20 and GM1 surface expression of CLL and
MCL cells was determined by FACS. Mean intensity fluorescence of CD20
and GM1 expression level of CLL patients (A ) and MCL patients (C ) are shown.
Susceptibility of CLL cells to rituximab was determined. CLL cells were purified
as described. CLL cells (5  105) were incubated in the presence or absence
of 100 Ag/mL rituximab in autologous serum with DSP30 (2 Amol/L) and IL-2
(100 units/mL). After 48 h, viable cells were determined by MTS assay. Numbers
shown (apoptotic cells) are the difference between viable cells in the presence
and absence of rituximab (B ). MCL cells (5  105) were incubated in the
presence or absence of 100 Ag/mL rituximab in autologous serum. After 48 h, cell
death was determined by FACS with Annexin V/PI staining (D ).

GM1 Determines Response to Rituximab

The GM1 expression patterns we observed in the lymphoma
cells of our patients correspond with the known response to
rituximab for most entities. Especially for marginal zone
lymphomas, we observed a high GM1 expression (Fig. 4A
and B), which correlates with a good response of these
lymphomas even to monotherapy with rituximab (40). The low
GM1 expression of most CLL cells is also in agreement with the
limited success of rituximab in this entity. Previous studies with
rituximab showed limited activity in previously treated patients
with CLL, with only 10% to 15% of the patients achieving a partial
response (41, 42). Therefore, rituximab was thought to be inactive
in this lymphoma when used as monotherapy. Recently, Keating
and colleagues published early results of the combination of
rituximab with the chemotherapy fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (R-FC). This regimen resulted in high complete response
rates, indicating a role for rituximab in CLL, at least in combination with chemotherapy (43).
In contrast, our measured GM1 expression in follicular
lymphomas does not correlate with the known in vivo activity of
rituximab in this entity. However, it has been shown that follicular
lymphomas are killed mainly through ADCC. Therefore, it might
be possible that for ADCC, lipid rafts and GM1 expression do not
play a major role. In agreement with this speculation, FcgRIIIa
polymorphisms have been shown to be predictive for tumor
clearance for follicular lymphomas. The fact that FcgRIIIa and
FcgRIIa polymorhisms do not predict response to rituximab in
B-CLL (44) and MCL (45) suggests that different effector

mechanisms of rituximab are involved in tumor eradication in
different non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.
Especially for CLL and MCL, our data provide new aspects that
might be useful for future therapeutic strategies. Our data support
the monotherapeutic use of rituximab at least in a subgroup of CLL
patients with high GM1 expression. A different treatment option
that has not been investigated in CLL yet, but has been shown to be
very effective in other indolent lymphomas, is maintenance therapy
with rituximab (46–50). In a study by Ghielmini and colleagues in
follicular lymphoma, the event-free survival increased from 12 to
23 months under maintenance therapy with rituximab. Because
our data provide evidence that rituximab has an effect in CLL
patients with high GM1 expression cells, these patients might
benefit from rituximab maintenance therapy. Together, these data
encourage further investigation of the role of rituximab on the basis
of GM1 expression in prospective studies in patients with CLL.
