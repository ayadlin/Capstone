ABSTRACT
The FLT3-ITD mutation is one of the most prevalent oncogenic mutations in AML.
Several FLT3 kinase inhibitors have shown impressive activity in clinical evaluation,
however clinical responses are usually transient and clinical effects are rapidly lost
due to drug resistance. One of the resistance mechanisms in the AML refractory
patients involves FLT3-ligand induced reactivation of AKT and/or ERK signaling via
FLT3 wt kinase. Via a screen of numerous AKT kinase inhibitors, we identified the
well-established orally available AKT inhibitor, A674563, as a dual suppressor of AKT
and FLT3-ITD. A674563 suppressed FLT3-ITD positive AML both in vitro and in vivo.
More importantly, compared to other FLT3 inhibitors, A674563 is able to overcome
FLT3 ligand-induced drug resistance through simultaneous inhibition of FLT3-ITDand AKT-mediated signaling. Our findings suggest that A674563 might be a potential
drug candidate for overcoming FLT3 ligand-mediated drug resistance in FLT3-ITD
positive AML.

INTRODUCTION

more selective second generation kinase inhibitors, such as
quizartinib (AC220), crenolanib and PLX3397, have been
tested in the clinic and have led to initial transient responses
but followed by development of resistance [4]. One of the
resistance mechanisms in the AML refractory patients is
drug treatment-induced elevation of FLT3 ligand levels
that can lead to the persistent activation of downstream
mediators, such as AKT [5, 6]. We were interested in finding
a single agent capable of dually inhibiting AKT and FLT3ITD kinases; this dual activity characteristic of one small
molecule inhibitor would be expected to reduce off-target
effects as well as associated potential drug-drug interactions
through the standard drug combination approach. Here, we

Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is the most
common acute leukemia in adults and usually leads to death
within months if untreated [1]. The type III receptor tyrosine
kinase, FLT3, has been found to play an important role in the
differentiation and survival of hematopoietic stem cells in
bone marrow [2]. The FLT3-ITD mutation, which is found
in approximately 30% of AML patients, has been validated
as one of the most important driver oncogenes for AML
[3]. A variety of small molecule inhibitors, including the
first generation multi-targeted kinase inhibitors, sunitinib,
midostaurin (PKC-412), and lestaurtinib (CEP-701), and

A674563 selectively inhibits FLT3-ITD mutant
kinase biochemically

identified the previously reported AKT inhibitor, A674563,
as a selective FLT3-ITD inhibitor [7]. A674563 exhibits
potent activity against FLT3-ITD positive AML cancer
cells in vitro and in vivo through selective, dual inhibition of
AKT and FLT3 kinases, and is also capable of overcoming
FLT3 ligand-induced drug resistance in FLT3 wt/ITD
co-expressing cells.

In the purified enzymatic ADP-Glo assays, A674563
exhibits greater selectivity for the FLT3-ITD mutant (IC50:
134 nM) versus FLT3 wt (IC50: 2171 nM). (Figure1C)
Kinetics analysis demonstrates that A674563 is an ATP
competitive inhibitor. (Figure 1D) A molecular modeling
study of A674563 in FLT3 kinase (PDB ID: 1RJB,
homology building) suggests that the NH of indazole
moiety forms a hydrogen bond with Cys694 in the hinge
binding area, and a nitrogen atom of pyridine moiety in
the middle part of the inhibitor forms a hydrogen bond
with Lys644. The phenyl ring of the tail part directs into
the solvent area and forms a partial π- π interaction with
Tyr842. (Figure 1E) For AKT kinase (PDB ID: 3CQU),
A674563 forms a similar hydrogen bond in the hinge area
with Ala 230 and with Lys179, however the amine group
in the tail part forms a third hydrogen bond with Asn
279 and forces the phenyl ring to rotate back to the more
hydrophobic ATP binding pocket (Figure 1F).

RESULTS
A674563 exhibits relatively selective antiproliferative potency against FLT3-ITD-positive
AML cancer cells
We screened a panel of AKT inhibitors using FLT3
inhibitors AC220 [8] and TCS359 [9] as positive controls
against FLT3-ITD-positive (MOLM13, MOLM14 and
MV4-11) and FLT3 wt (U937, HL-60, PF382, SKM-1, NB4
and OCI-AML3) AML cell lines. (Figure 1A and Table 1)
A previously reported AKT inhibitor, A674563, exhibited
relatively selective potency against FLT3-ITD-positive
cell lines, MOLM13 (GI50: 0.06 μM), MOLM14 (GI50:
0.18 μM) and MV4-11 (GI50: 0.075 μM), versus the FLT3
wt-expressing cell lines (about 5-20 fold less potent). The
well-characterized FLT3 kinase inhibitors, AC220 and
TCS359, exhibited a similar trend. The clonogenic assay also
confirmed the selective efficacy of A674563 against FLT3ITD positive AML cell lines (MV4-11, EC50: 0.092 μM;
MOLM13, EC50: 0.17 μM; MOLM14, EC50: 0.061 μM)
compared to FLT3-wt expressing cell lines (PF382,
EC50: 0.861 μM; U937, EC50: 0.505 μM; HL-60, EC50:
0.387 μM) (Supplementary Figure 1).

A674563 simultaneously inhibits FLT3-ITD- and
AKT-mediated signaling
We then investigated the effect of A674563 on
FLT3- and AKT-mediated signaling pathways in FLT3ITD-positive cell lines (Figure 2A). A674563 significantly
affected the auto-phosphorylation of FLT3-ITD at the
Y589/591 site in these intact cancer cell lines starting from
5 μM but potently inhibited the phosphorylation of STAT5,
a downstream mediator of FLT3 signaling, as well as the
expression of c-MYC starting from 0.5 μM concentration.
In contrast, the AKT inhibitor, MK2206, did not affect
this signaling pathway [10]. A674563 treatment led to an
increase in AKT phosphorylation at both S473 and T308
but displayed inhibitory activity against phosphorylation of
signaling molecules downstream of AKT, including GSK3β,
FOXO1, PRAS40, and further downstream targets P70S6K
and 4EBP1via mTOR kinase, which is consistent with the
previous report [11] This suggests that dual FLT3 and AKT
inhibition contribute to the growth inhibition of these cells.
However, in the FLT3 wild-type (wt) expressing cell lines,
OCI-AML-3 and U937, phosphorylation of FLT3 Y589/591
were not detected and phosphorylation of STAT5 as well as
cMyc expression were unaffected, except the AKT kinase
mediated signaling pathway (Supplementary Figure 4).

A674563 displays anti-proliferative activity against
FLT3-mutant engineered isogenic BaF3 cells
In a panel of FLT3 kinase wt/mutant–expressing
BaF3 isogenic cell lines, A674563 showed potent antiproliferative activity against the FLT3-ITD mutant (GI50:
0.088 μM) compared to parental BaF3 cells (GI50: 1.6 μM).
(Table 2) Interestingly, it also potently inhibited FLT3D835Y mutant-expressing cells (GI50: 0.045 μM). It was
less potent against drug-acquired secondary mutants such
as FLT3-ITD-D835Y (GI50: 0.42 μM) and FLT3-ITD-F691L
(GI50: 0.43 μM). In addition, all of the inhibitory activities
could be substantially rescued after addition of IL-3, which
suggests that inhibitory effects are on-target. (Supplementary
Figure 2) However, for the TEL-fused wt FLT3-BaF3
cell line, A674563 exhibited much less potent inhibitory
activity (GI50: 1.0 μM). We also found that A674563 was
most potent against auto-phosphorylation of FLT3-ITD
(EC50: 0.085 μM) and FLT3-D835Y (EC50: 0.045 μM),
but was least potent against auto-phosphorylation of FLT3ITD-D835Y (EC50: 1.26 μM), FLT3-ITD-F691L (EC50:
0.4 μM) and FLT3 wt (EC50: 0.87 μM); this is consistent
with the demonstrated anti-proliferative activity of A674563
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 3).

0.3 μM and more significantly at 1 μM (Figure 2B). In

Combination of selective AKT and FLT3 kinase
inhibitors can mimic the dual inhibitory effect of
A674563

inhibitor, TCS359, and AKT inhibitors MK2206 did not
induce apoptosis. In addition, in FLT3 wt-expressing AML
cell lines, OCI-AML3 and U937, none of the inhibitors
demonstrated a strong apoptotic effect at concentrations up
to 1 μM (Supplementary Figure 5). A674563 arrested cell
cycle in G0/G1 phase in the FLT3-ITD positive cells, and
surprisingly blocked FLT3 wt-expressing cells (OCI-AML-3
and U937) in S phase which suggests a distinct inhibition
mechanism (Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 6).

We then looked at the combination of AKT and
FLT3 inhibitors to see if they were able to recapitulate
the effect of dual inhibition by A674563. Due to the high
potency of AC220 (single digit nM range) against these
FLT3-ITD cells, which would leave little margin to observe

synergy with an AKT inhibitor, we chose the less potent
FLT3 inhibitor, TCS359, to observe the combination
effect more clearly [3]. In the MV4-11 cell line, 1/5 of
the GI50 concentration (0.12 μM/0.68 μM) of TCS359
combined with 1/50 of the GI50 concentration of MK2206
(0.12 μM/5.2 μM) was able to potently and synergistically
inhibit the cell proliferation (55% combination inhibition
versus 98.96% and 88.64% individual inhibition
respectively, CI index: 0.29) (Figure 3A right lane and
Supplementary Table 1). Similar synergistic effects were
observed with MOLM13 (CI index: 0.41 with 0.12 μM
TCS359 and 0.36 μM MK2206) and MOLM14 cells (CI
index: 0.49 with 3.3 μM TCS359 and 0.12 μM MK2206)
(Figure 3A and Supplementary Figure 7).

only FLT3-wt kinase is amenable for the FLT3 ligand
stimulation [13]. We then looked at signaling in MOLM14
cells with/without FLT3 ligand. (Figure 3C) As reported
previously, phosphorylation of STAT5 was not affected
by the presence of FLT3 ligand. However, the inhibitory
effects of MLN518 on FLT3 phosphorylation and/or
c-MYC expression were decreased upon FLT3 ligand
stimulation. Interestingly, there was no significant effect
of A674563 treatment in the presence of FLT3 ligand
stimulation on the expression of cMYC. (Figure 3C and
Supplementary Figure 8) For Akt-mediated signaling,
there was an apparent increase of pS6K phosphorylation
upon MLN518 treatment in the presence of FLT3 ligand.
However, A674563 led to a more potent inhibition
of pFOXO1, pS6K and p4EBP1 upon FLT3 ligand
stimulation (Figure 3D and Supplementary Figure 9).

AML cancer cell lines

A674563 inhibits FLT3-ITD-positive primary

We next investigated the ability of A674563 to
override drug resistance when FLT3-ITD cells were
cultured in the presence of FLT3 ligand. With 10 ng/mL
FLT3 ligand stimulation, FLT3-ITD-positive cells
were not resistant to A674563. (Figure 3B and Table 3)
However, the FLT3 inhibitors TCS359 and MLN518 lost
significant activity against FLT3-ITD/FLT3 wt-expressing
MOLM13 and MOLM14 cells (6-15 fold), but not
against FLT3-ITD homozygous MV4-11 cells (Figure 3B
and Table 3) [12]. This is consistent with the report that

In FLT3-ITD-positive AML patient primary cells,
A674563 exhibited potent anti-proliferation activity at

DISCUSSION

gain of function of mutation of FLT3 in the kinase domain,
implying another potential application of A674563.

Drug resistance is a serious limiting factor for targeted
therapy approaches in the clinic [14]. Combination therapy
is one of the most effective approaches to overriding this
resistance [15]. However, drug-drug interactions and
IP issues limit the clinical effectiveness of inclusion of
additional drugs in the treatment regimen Rationally
controlled multiple-target-single-agent therapy theoretically
has advantages to minimize these problems [16].
A674563 has been validated as a selective AKT kinase
inhibitor that suppresses tumor growth in the prostate cancer
animal models [7]. Previously comprehensive kinome wide
selectivity profiling also demonstrates that A674563 has
strong binding affinity to FLT3-ITD kinase (Kd: 83 nM
compared to 540 nM against FLT3 wt) [17]. It also displays
strong binding Kd to other kinases such as AAK1, CIT,
CLKs, DYRK1, and PRKs kinases, however currently there
is no evidence to support that those kinases are involved
in AML. In addition, A674563 exhibited strong binding to
ROCK1 kinase as well, which has been implicated to play
roles in the c-KIT, FLT3 and BCR-ABL oncogenes mediated
myeloproliferative diseases [18]. Whether or not these
targets contribute directly or indirectly to the observed antiFLT3-ITD AML growth activity and FLT3 ligand induced
drug resistance would require further mechanistic study.
That said, we could not definitely exclude the possibility
that target(s) other than AKT/FLT3 contribute to the potent
activity of A674563 against FLT3-ITD AML. In addition,
although A674563 potently inhibits FLT3-ITD activity in the
biochemical assays, FLT3-ITD auto-phosphorylation in the
isogenic BaF3 cells as well the downstream target Stat5’s
phosphorylation in the established AML cell lines MV4-11,
it does not potently inhibit FLT3-ITD’s auto-phosphorylation
in the MV4-11 cells until 5 μM, which indicates that there
might be some hidden mechanisms regarding to the FLT3ITD’s auto-phosphorylation and requires further detailed
elucidation.
In summary, we have discovered that A674563,
a previously reported AKT kinase inhibitor, also
demonstrates selective FLT3-ITD kinase activity over
FLT3 wt in the biochemical assays, which makes it
selectively potent toward FLT3-ITD positive AML cancer
cell lines. This dual inhibition efficacy can be recapitulated
by the combination of the AKT and FLT3 kinase inhibitors.
In addition, A674563 can overcome FLT3 ligand-induced
drug resistance. In FLT3-ITD positive AML patient primary
cells and a FLT3-ITD-positive xenograft model, A674563
displayed great anti-tumor activity. As clinical resistance
can arise in AML patients coharboring FLT3-ITD and
FLT3 wt due to the stimulation effects of FLT3 ligand and
subsequent hyper-activation of AKT signaling, A674563 as
a dual AKT and FLT3-ITD inhibitor could potentially serve
as a novel approach to effectively treat FLT3-ITD-positive
AML. In addition, A674563 was highly sensitive against
FLT3-D835Y mutant, which is another common critical

Rabbit mAb (#2708), Phospho-p70 S6 Kinase (Thr389)
(108D2) Rabbit mAb (#9234). Antibodies were used at
1:1000. Protein lysate preparation and immunoblotting
were carried out as previously described.

in the presence of 10 ng/mL FLT3 ligand. Cell viability
was measured with the CellTiter–Glo assay (Promega,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
and luminescence was measured in a multi-label reader
(Envision, PerkinElmer, USA). Data were normalized
to control groups (DMSO) and represented by the mean
of three independent measurements with standard error
< 20%. GI50 values were calculated using Prism 5.0
(GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).

FLT3, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-D835Y protein
purification
FLT3 wt/FLT3-ITD/FLT3-D835Y cytoplasmic
fragment with his tag was cloned into baculovirus
expression vector pFASTHT-A. The recombinant bacmid
was transfected into SF9 by Cellfectin (Invitrogen).
High titer viral stocks were obtained by two rounds of
amplification of the virus. The protein was expressed by
infecting SF9 cells with high titer viral stocks for 48 h. Cells
were harvested and re-suspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF). The cells were
lysed by ultra sonication and the cell debris was removed
by ultracentrifugation. The supernatant was incubated with
Ni-affinity beads (GE). The beads were then washed by
lysis buffer containing 50–250 mM imidazole. The elute
was loaded to superdex 75. The protein was concentrated to
1 mg/ml and aliquots were frozen and stored at −80°C. The
protein was used for ADP-Glo™ kinase assay.

Kinase kinetic assay
Kinetic analyses of FLT3-ITD were performed using
a luminometric kinase assay varying the concentration of
ATP using the ADP-Glo reagents (Promega). The serially
diluted A674563 and FLT3-ITD (40 ng/μL) were assayed
in a reaction (10 μL) containing 40 mM Tris (pH 7.6),
20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 50 μM DTT. After 60 min
incubation at RT, various concentrations of ATP, 0.2 μg/μL
FLT3 substrate Poly (4:1 Glu, Tyr) peptide added and
incubated for 60 min at 37°C. The overall rate of reaction
is determined as the slope of the decreasing phase of the
reaction. Each data point was collected in duplicate and
kinetic parameters were obtained using Prism 5.0 (GraphPad
Software, San Diego, CA).

ADP-Glo biochemical assay

IP kinase assay

The ADP-Glo™ kinase assay (Promega, Madison,
WI) was used to screen A674563 for its FLT3 inhibition
effects. The kinase reaction system contains 4.95 μL FLT3WT (40 ng/μL) or FLT3-ITD (40 ng/μL), 0.55 μL of serially
diluted A674563, and 5.5 μL FLT3 substrate Poly (4:1 Glu,
Tyr) peptide (0.2 μg/μL) (Promega, Madison, WI) with
100 μM ATP (final concentration: 50 μM) (Promega,
Madison, WI). The reaction in each tube was started
immediately by adding ATP and kept going for an hour
under 37°C. After the tube cooled for 5 minutes at room
temperature, 5 μL solvent reactions were carried out in a
384-well plate. Then 5 μL of ADP-Glo™ reagent was
added into each well to stop the reaction and consume
the remaining ADP within 40 minutes. At the end, 10 μL
of kinase detection reagent was added into the well and
incubated for 30 minutes to produce a luminescence signal.
Luminescence signal was measured with an automated plate
reader (Perkin-Elmer Envision) and each measurement was
performed in triplicate.

The reaction system contains 200 ng FLT3 proteins.
The serially diluted A674563 was added to the proteins.
After 30 min incubation at RT, ATP (final concentration:
10 μM) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37°C. The
reactions were stopped by add 5× sample buffer. Then the
Phosphorylation of FLT3 was detected by western-blot
using pFLT3 Tyr 589/591 and phosphotyrosine antibody.

BaF3 isogenic cell line generation
Retroviral constructs for BaF3-FLT3 mutants were
made based on the pMSCVpuro (Clontech) backbone. For
TEL-FLT3 vector, the first 1 kb of human TEL gene with
an artificial myristoylation sequence (MGCGCSSHPEDD)
was cloned into pMSCVpuro retroviral vector, followed by
a 3xFLAG tag sequence and a stop codon. Then the kinase
domain coding sequence of FLT3 was inserted in-frame
between TEL and 3× FLAG sequences. For full-length
expression vectors, the coding sequences of FLT3 variants
were directly cloned in pMSCVpuro vector with a 3X FLAG
tag at the C-terminal end. All mutagenesis studies were
performed using the QuikChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Kit (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Retrovirus was packaged in HEK293T cells by transfecting
FLT3-containing MSCV vectors together with two helper
plasmids, virus supernatants were harvested 48 hours after
transfection and filtered before infection. Then BaF3 cells
were infected with harvested virus supernatants using

Cell proliferation assay
Cells were grown in 96-well culture plates (3000/
well). Various concentrations of drugs were added into
plates, DMSO concentrations were kept constant and did
not exceed 0.1% of the total volume. Cell proliferation
was determined after 72 hours drug treatment. For FLT3
ligand induced drug resistance assay, A674563 and FLT3
inhibitor TCS359, MLN518 were added into the cell culture

puromycin selection for 48 hours. The IL-3 concentrations
in the culture medium were gradually withdrawn until cells
were able to grow in the absence of IL-3.

MOLM14, MV4-11 cells were treated with serially
diluted A674563, TCS359 (1 μM), MK2206 (1 μM) for
24 hours. Cells were then washed in PBS and lysed in cell
lysis buffer. PARP, Caspase-3, GAPDH antibodies (Cell
signaling Technology) were used for immunoblotting.

Combination study
The FLT3-ITD-expressing lines MOLM-13,
MOLM14 and MV4-11 were grown in 96-well culture
plates (3000/well), respectively. Combination treatment
with the FLT3 kinase inhibitor, TCS359, and with the Akt
inhibitor, MK2206, was performed. Cell proliferation was
determined after treatment with compounds for 72 hours.
Cell viability was measured using the CellTiter–Glo assay
(Promega, USA), data were normalized to control groups
(DMSO) and represented by the mean of three independent
measurements with standard error < 20%. CI index was
calculated by Calcusyn software (Biosoft, version 2.1), using
the Chou-Talalay method [19].

Molecular modeling
Based on FLT3 PDB structure (PDB id: 1RJB),
which has the DFG-out motif conformation, the DFGin motif conformation was built by an optimization with
DFG-in motif restraining and a short MD released process
using Tinker software. Then the released DFG-in motif
conformation used as the molecular modeling of FLT3 to
dock A674563 compound.

Colony formation assay
In brief, 1 mL of 3 % agarose combined with 1 mL
MOLM-13, MOLM-14, MV4-11, PF-382, U937, HL-60
growth media was used as the bottom agar in a 6-well plate.
1000 cells in 1.8 mL growth media was combined with
0.2 μL of 3% agarose solution and 2 μL serially diluted
A674563, then plated on top of the bottom layer. Cells were
maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37°C for
15 days. On the 15th day, the numbers of colonies in each
well were counted and each measurement was performed
in triplicate.

Cell cycle analysis
MOLM14, MV4-11 cells were treated with serially
diluted A674563, TCS359 (1 μM), MK2206 (1 μM) for
24 hours. The cells were fixed in 70% cold ethanol and
incubated at −20°C overnight, then stained with PI/RNase
staining buffer (BD Pharmingen). Flow cytometry was
performed using a FACS Calibur (BD), and results were
analyzed by ModFit software.

Balb/c-nu mice. Daily oral administration was initiated when
MOLM-14 tumors had reached a size of 200 to 400 mm3.
Animals were then randomized into treatment groups of 10
mice each for efficacy studies. A674563 was delivered daily
in a HKI solution (0.5% Methocellulose/0.4% Tween80
in ddH2O) by orally gavage. A range of doses of A674563
or their vehicles were administered, as indicated in figure
legends. Tumor growth was measured daily after A674563
treatment. Tumor volumes were calculated as follows: tumor
volume (mm3) = [(W2 × L)/2] in which width (W) is defined
as the smaller of the two measurements and length (L) is
defined as the larger of the two measurements.
