BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a highly prevalent and clinically significant symptom of advanced prostate cancer. To date,
however, there are no published controlled trials of interventions for fatigue in men with prostate cancer. METHODS:
This 6-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design evaluated the efficacy of methylphenidate to treat
fatigue in prostate cancer patients. Inclusion criteria included men with advanced prostate cancer and the presence
of moderate to severe fatigue. Patients with major depression, hypothyroidism, uncontrolled hypertension, arrhythmia, or anemia were excluded. Fatigue levels, blood pressure, pulse, and other safety concerns were monitored regularly. RESULTS: Thirty-two subjects were randomized to methylphenidate (n ¼ 16) or placebo (n ¼ 16). Brief Fatigue
Inventory total scores significantly decreased for both groups; however, the methylphenidate group, as compared
with placebo, reported greater decrease on Brief Fatigue Inventory severity scores (P ¼ .03) and a trend toward
greater decrease on Brief Fatigue Inventory total scores (P ¼ .07). A significantly greater number of subjects in the
methylphenidate group versus the placebo group demonstrated clinically significant improvement in fatigue on total
Brief Fatigue Inventory scores (7 of 10 vs 3 of 13) and Brief Fatigue Inventory severity scores (8 of 10 vs 3 of 13).
Importantly, 6 subjects in the methylphenidate group discontinued because of increased blood pressure or tachycardia. There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Methylphenidate is effective in treating fatigue in men
with prostate cancer; however, oncologists need to monitor for possible pulse and blood pressure elevations. Cancer

Fatigue is a common and distressing symptom of cancer and cancer treatments.1-5 The impact of fatigue has been
associated with considerable negative effects on mood, leading to or exacerbating anxiety or depressive symptoms, functional morbidity, and poor quality of life, and has a significant negative impact on caregivers.6-10
Prostate cancer is the most common site of cancer in men in the United States.11 Patients with advanced prostate
cancer are among those most at risk for developing fatigue, because they are likely to have widespread bony metastases
and/or anemia and are likely to receive androgen deprivation agents or antiandrogens,8,12-14 radiation therapy,15-21 or
chemotherapy. Reports estimate that fatigue is a distressing symptom in up to 67% of prostate cancer patients.22,23
Psychostimulants have been used with some success in treating fatigue of various etiologies,18-21,24-33 and are widely
regarded to be safe.34 Although controlled studies examining nonpharmacological interventions35 as well as pharmacological interventions for fatigue related to cancer have being conducted,8,18,28,29,33,36-38 pharmacological interventions for fatigue in prostate cancer patients have not been extensively studied.39-42
Bruera et al recently published 2 double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCT), where palliative cancer patients
were prescribed either methylphenidate29 or donepezil28 against placebo for 7 days. The authors found that fatigue intensity improved in each of the 3 groups, yet there were no between group differences between the active medication groups
and placebo groups, suggesting that these medications were not significantly superior to placebo. In an RCT of methylphenidate versus pemoline versus placebo in HIV patients, Breitbart et al6 also found a placebo effect; however, there was
a significant but delayed improvement in fatigue in the 2 psychostimulant groups, with significant differences noted from
the placebo group emerging at Week 3 of the trial. Lower et al recently reported on the impact of dexmethylphenidate in a

randomized controlled trial (RCT) for fatigue after chemotherapy in cancer patients. In this heterogeneous population, the placebo effect was also strong; however, the
medication group reported lower levels of fatigue for all 8
weeks of the study.43 Given the high levels of fatigue in
prostate cancer, the lack of RCT studies testing pharmacological treatments for fatigue in prostate cancer, and the
contradictory results of current RCTs in cancer patients,
it is important to test the potential benefit of psychostimulants with an appropriate time period in the management of fatigue in cancer patients in general and in
prostate cancer patients in particular.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dosetitrated, 6-week intervention trial comparing the efficacy
and monitoring safety of the psychostimulant methylphenidate against placebo in the treatment of fatigue in ambulatory men with advanced prostate cancer. This study
received institutional review board approval at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Men with prostate cancer were identified and
screened for fatigue in the outpatient waiting areas. To
pass this initial 1-question screen, men had to rate their
average level of fatigue over the previous 2 weeks as 4 on
a 0 to 10 numeric rating scale (ie, moderate to severe fatigue). Patients who qualified for the study under this initial screen were then asked secondary screening questions
to rule out cognitive impairment (Mini Mental Status
Exam), major depression (Structural Clinical Interview of
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition), and medical conditions and medications that would contraindicate the use of a
psychostimulant. Patients with anemia (ie, severe anemia
where hemoglobin is <11.0) who had received 6 weeks of
epoetin alfa therapy and still had significant fatigue were
eligible for this stimulant trial. Patients with hypothyroidism who had received 6 weeks of thyroid supplementation
therapy and still had significant fatigue were also eligible
for this stimulant trial. Patients had to be able to give
informed consent.
The patients were randomly assigned by the hospital
pharmacy to receive either methylphenidate or placebo
for a period of 6 weeks. The research staff remained
blinded to this assignment. Methylphenidate was administered in capsules containing 5 mg each, with a starting
dose of 1 capsule in the morning. Patients in the placebo
group received identically appearing capsules. All other
Cancer

medications were held at their usual doses during the
study period unless a change was mandated by the clinical
situation. All medications taken during the study period
were recorded by the patient on the medication diary.
The research nurse or physician was in contact with
patients at least twice a week, and more often if necessary,
to assess the need for titration of dosage and to ensure
patients’ safety. The nurse monitored blood pressure,
pulse, and other vital signs weekly. The dose was increased
by 1 capsule (5 mg) on Day 3, added as a mid-day dose, if
fatigue was not substantially reduced, there was no toxicity from the study treatment, and the patient was willing
to increase the dose. Dosage was titrated upward (or
downward) every 2 to 3 days to a maximum of 6 capsules
daily, divided into morning and mid-day doses (equivalent to a total maximum daily dose of 30 mg of
methylphenidate).
One week’s supply of the study drug was dispensed
at each weekly evaluation point. Baseline information
related to fatigue etiology, severity, and treatment responsiveness of fatigue was collected at study entry and at the
end of the study (6 weeks). Primary outcome measurements of fatigue were the Brief Fatigue Inventory44 and
the Fatigue Severity Scale.45 The Brief Fatigue Inventory
has 2 subscales: a 4-question fatigue severity subscale, and
a 5-question fatigue interference subscale. The Brief Fatigue Inventory was chosen as the primary outcome
because it has demonstrated good psychometrics, and it
assesses both severity and interference related to fatigue.44
The Fatigue Severity Scale questions focus primarily on
interference questions about physical functioning, work,
family, and social life. Secondary outcome measurements
included depression and psychological distress (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale46 and the Beck
Depression Inventory47), quality of life (the Functional
Assessment of Cancer Therapy Scale-Prostate Cancer48),
and cognitive and neuropsychological test performance.
Patients also completed a demographic questionnaire, the
Systematic Assessment for Treatment of Emergent Events
(SAFTEE) questionnaire,49 and the Extrapyramidal
Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS).50 The ESRS was chosen
to closely monitor potential development of tics or involuntary movements that may accompany psychostimulant
medication that were not assessed by SAFTEE. The
patients completed the entire battery of questionnaires at
baseline (before randomization) and then at the end of the
study (the sixth week). Patients completed the Brief Fatigue Inventory, SAFTEE, and ESRS on a weekly basis
when their vital signs were monitored. Patients were asked

to complete a Medication Diary on a daily basis throughout the study.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to report demographic
and baseline data. Repeated measures t tests were used to
assess changes in study variables within each group to
determine whether there was a within-group medication
or placebo effect. Change scores between baseline and the
6-week follow-up were calculated, and between-subjects t
tests was used to determine whether there were significant
differences in these change scores for the medication
group versus the placebo group. In addition, chi-square
analysis was used to determine whether a greater percentage of subjects in the medication group reported clinically
significant change as compared with the placebo group.

RESULTS
Screening and Dropout
Our initial recruitment goal was to accrue 120 men to the
study, with 60 subjects randomized to each treatment
arm. A total of 1054 patients were screened for the study.
Of those screened, 804 (77%) did not meet the fatigue eligibility criteria. Of the 247 (23%) subjects who met the
initial fatigue eligibility criteria, only 39 (16%) agreed to
participate in the study; 75 (30%) were ineligible because
of a severe medical or psychiatric condition (ie, uncontrolled hypertension, history of arrhythmia or other severe
cardiac disease, severe renal or hepatic disease, severe anemia, major depressive disorder). Seventy-five (30%)
declined to participate in a research study, and 58 (24%)
showed an interest in the study but eventually declined.
Of the 39 subjects who registered for the study and completed baseline data, 7 subjects withdrew before being
randomized to a treatment. Of the 32 remaining subjects,
16 were randomized to the methylphenidate group, and
16 were randomized to the placebo group. The study was
closed before our target enrollment goal was reached
because of funding restrictions.
Of the 16 subjects assigned to the methylphenidate
group, 4 (31%) men who started receiving methylphenidate had to be discontinued from the study because of
increased blood pressure according to preset guidelines
(170/100 mm Hg), and 2 (6%) men had to be discontinued from the study because of tachycardia. Of the 16
men in the placebo group, 3 (19%) dropped out of the
study, citing personal reasons preventing continued study
participation. There were no withdrawals from the pla-

cebo group because of reported adverse side effects. There
were no abnormal movements or tics noted, and no serious adverse events related to study participation.
An intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis was considered
when analyzing the decrease in fatigue and other study
measures that used continuous variables. However, once a
subject dropped out of the study, these assessments were
not collected and, as a result, there are missing data for these
subjects who dropped out of the study. The last observation
carried forward method would have to be used to conduct
an ITT analysis in this situation; however, the last observation carried forward method assumes the dropout in the
study is completely at random.51,52 As stated above, the
dropout in the medication group was in fact not random,
but because of specific side effects of the medication. As a
result, we will not use ITT analysis when assessing continuous variables. The final analysis of the continuous data will

Change in Fatigue Scores
When analyzing the within-group results, the methylphenidate group showed a significant reduction in scores on
the Brief Fatigue Inventory. The mean of the Brief Fatigue
Inventory total scores in the methylphenidate group
decreased from 5.13 at baseline to 2.19 at end of study.
This reduction was statistically significant (t(9) ¼ 3.63, P
¼ .01). The results for the methylphenidate group for the
severity and interference subscales of the Brief Fatigue Inventory were similar in magnitude and significance (Table
2). There was also a placebo effect seen in this study. The

(2.84), t (12) ¼ 2.58, P ¼ .02. The placebo group also
reported a significant reduction in the interference subscale of the Brief Fatigue Inventory, but not in the severity
subscale. In terms of the second primary outcome, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the methylphenidate group showed a
trend toward significant reduction (t(9) ¼ 1.99, P ¼ .08).
There was not a significant reduction in Fatigue Severity

in the methylphenidate group was greater than the

the subscales of the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the methylphenidate group showed a significantly greater reduction
in Brief Fatigue Inventory severity scores (t(21) ¼ 2.28, P
¼ .03, d ¼ 0.93) as compared with the placebo group.
There was no significant difference in the change scores in
the interference subscale of the Brief Fatigue Inventory.
All differences were associated with large effects sizes, indicating that if the sample size was larger, the differences
between groups in change scores of the Brief Fatigue Inventory total score and interference subscale would have
been statistically significant (Table 3). Figures 2 and 3
present the weekly Brief Fatigue Inventory data for the
total Brief Fatigue Inventory scores and the fatigue severity scores, respectively. It appears the difference for the
total Brief Fatigue Inventory scores is not seen until Week
6, whereas the separation for severity scores is seen at
Week 3. In addition, there was no significant difference in
change scores when analyzing the Fatigue Severity Scale
scores (Table 3).

by 1 standard deviation of the baseline scores.56 There are
no formal methods for the Brief Fatigue Inventory or the
Fatigue Severity Scale to determine clinically meaningful
changes in fatigue scores. The distribution method used
here (ie, 1 standard deviation) is consistent with the literature determining clinically meaningful differences.56 One
standard deviation of the baseline measures for the total
Brief Fatigue Inventory scores, the Brief Fatigue Inventory
severity subscale, and the Brief Fatigue Inventory interference subscale were as follows: 2.1, 2.1, and 2.4, respectively. When using an ITT analysis (ie, retaining all those
subjects who were randomized), those subjects who
dropped out of the study were considered not to have
reached a clinically significant decline in fatigue scores.
When examining clinically meaningful change of total
Brief Fatigue Inventory scores, there was no difference
between the number of subjects in the methylphenidate
group (7 of 16) who reported a clinically significant
reduction in Brief Fatigue Inventory total scores as compared with the placebo group (3 of 16; chi-square ¼ 2.33,
P ¼ .13). However, there was a trend toward significant
results on the Brief Fatigue Inventory severity scale (8 of
16 in the methylphenidate group vs 3 of 16 in the placebo
group, P ¼ .06). There were no differences seen in the
Brief Fatigue Inventory interference scale or the Fatigue
Severity Scale scores (1 standard deviation ¼ 1.3).
Because the reasons for dropout in the methylphenidate group are detailed, and ITT analysis has been
criticized because it may miss potentially important findings57 when including dropouts washes out significant
results, this analysis was also run using only those subjects
who completed the study. When examining clinically
meaningful change of total Brief Fatigue Inventory scores,
significantly more subjects in the methylphenidate group
(7 of 10) reported a clinically significant reduction in
Brief Fatigue Inventory total scores as compared with the
placebo group (3 of 13; chi-square ¼ 5.06, P ¼ .02;

also reported for the Brief Fatigue Inventory severity subscale; and similar results in magnitude were reported for
the interference subscale, although these were not statistically significant (P ¼ .07) (Table 4). There was no difference in clinically significant change in Fatigue Severity
Scale scores (1 standard deviation) between groups.
When assessing the impact of the interventions on
depression, anxiety, quality of life, and measures of cognitive
functioning, there were no significant differences seen
between the 2 groups. However, the differences in the
change in depression scores did produce potentially important effects sizes. The Cohen’s d effect size for the Hospital
Anxiety and Depression Scale Depression subscale and the
Beck Depression inventory were 0.54 and 0.38, respectively.

DISCUSSION
Our results suggest there is a decline in fatigue levels with
the use of methylphenidate in men with advanced prostate
cancer. Not unlike other psychostimulant trials for fatigue,6,29 there was a large placebo effect in our study; a
separation of placebo and study drug effects was seen at
Week 3 (severity scores) and Week 6 (total scores). It is
important to consider this placebo effect and time to
detect difference between groups when comparing these
results to previous studies designed to test the efficacy of
stimulants in cancer patients. Bruera et al reported negative results in palliative cancer patients; however, the study
period was only 7 days,28,29 and may not have been long
enough to see separation from the methylphenidate arm.
The negative results may also have been related to the severity of disease in the palliative population. To contrast
the Bruera et al results, 2 recent reports show efficacy of
stimulants for fatigue in cancer patients. Blackhall et al
reported a decline in fatigue in 19 cancer patients using
modafinil, and significant results were seen at Week 4 of
the study.58 These results should be considered preliminary, as there was no control group in this study. In a
Cancer

November 1, 2010

well-designed and powered RCT testing dexmethylphenidate for chemotherapy-related fatigue, Lower et al
reported a significant reduction in fatigue in the study
group compared with placebo.43 This study also showed a
large placebo effect; however, the separation between
groups occurred the first week after initiation of treatment
and continued for the remaining 7 weeks of the study.
The patients in the Lower et al study were physically
healthier (none were palliative) than the patients studied
by Bruera et al. When compared with the study group in
this current study, the Lower et al subjects were considerably younger (mean age, 53 vs 70 years), and the study
medication used was D-isomer of methylphenidate,
whose clinical efficacy is found at half the dose. Lastly, the
placebo effect in all these studies is rather remarkable. For
example, in both the data reported here and also in the
Lower et al study, the placebo group demonstrated a 30%
to 50% decrease in fatigue scores, and in both studies it
appears the placebo remained effective through the entire
study period. This underscores the importance of future
studies that focus on fatigue having a placebo control.
There was noteworthy difficulty accruing patients to
the study, which highlights some interesting issues. With >
1000 men screened for fatigue from the medical genitourinary oncology clinic at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center, only 23% met criteria for moderate to severe fatigue.
This is a much lower level of fatigue than noted in the literature. Of those men who were eligible for the study, 84%
declined entry into the study, often stating that they did not
want to be on yet another medication, or they did not want
to participate in a research study. Older cancer patients are
not easily recruited to clinical trials.59 Many who would
consider participation in a clinical trial are hesitant to accept
taking a medication that does not specifically target treatment of the cancer. Older patients are also fearful about
potential side effects and drug interactions that may hamper
an already compromised quality of life.
Many physicians display some hesitancy in prescribing controlled substances to older cancer patients because

5107

Original Article

of concerns about their ability to tolerate these medications. Although our study did have some men reporting
side effects from the medication, with careful observation,
there were no severe adverse reactions. There are now
additional studies that use stimulants to safely treat cancer-related fatigue. Of the men who tolerated methylphenidate, many showed significant improvement in their
fatigue, and most wanted to continue the medicine at the
end of the trial. Many called it a ‘‘wonder drug.’’ Despite
this, we did have 6 men who had to come off of the study
because of medication side effects; 4 subjects experienced
a rise in blood pressure beyond study parameters, and 2
patients had tachycardia. This is a high rate compared
with other studies testing methylphenidate. We have
reviewed the study charts of these men and have
attempted to find some predictors of these cardiovascular
side effects; however, no consistent predictors emerged.
One reason for this may be that the study was designed to
test efficacy and maintain safety, as opposed to explicitly
examining the etiology of those men who experience cardiovascular side effects from the medication. As a result,
the approved institutional review board protocol was not
designed to keep a detailed medical history for each subject once the extensive eligibility requirements were satisfied. We can report that all men were either on hormone
ablation therapy and/or chemotherapy; however, to the
best of our knowledge methylphenidate does not interact
with these medications in a way that would raise blood
pressure. The range of medication dose for men who
experienced cardiovascular side effects was 10 to 30 mg,
and the rise in blood pressure or pulse rate was experienced between Week 2 and Week 5. The medication escalation in this study was similar to that of other studies that
investigated methylphenidate.6 The Breitbart study
started subjects at a higher dose (7.5 mg/d) and titrated
the study drug to higher end dosages (60 mg/d). In terms
of medication escalation, it is difficult to compare this
current study with the Lower et al study, because the
Lower et al study used a different isomer of methylphenidate and therefore had a different dosing regimen. All of
the men who experienced these side effects were on multiple medications, but all medications with known interactions with methylphenidate were exclusionary criteria.
Despite the finding that the average age of the study population was high (mean age, 70 years), this also does not
appear to be a predictor, because the average age of those
men who experienced these side effects was 64 years. Considering these results, it is important to conduct good clinical practice with all men who are prescribed these

5108

stimulants and appropriately monitor blood pressure and
heart rate.
The limitations of the study have been alluded to
previously. First, the total number of patients accrued to
the trial and the numbers in each study group were
extremely small, especially compared with our original
target numbers. As such, these results should be considered preliminary, and suggest that continued effort should
be extended to conducting a larger trial. It is possible that
the population of older prostate cancer patients at our tertiary care cancer center has different fatigue levels than at
other treatment locations. It is also possible that our 1question screening measure of ‘‘fatigue in the last 2 weeks’’
was not sensitive enough to identify the actual prevalence
of fatigue in our clinic patients.
Our study points to future research that will help
improve the quality of life of men with prostate cancer.
Consideration of a psychostimulant that might have fewer
cardiovascular side effects than methylphenidate, such as
modafinil, which is a wakefulness-promoting agent that is
less potently sympathomimetic than conventional stimulants such as methylphenidate and dextroamphetamine,
may lead to better tolerance of the study medication and
therefore fewer dropouts. A feasibility trial of longer-acting psychostimulants that have become available in the
last few years may decrease the burden on patients who
have to take multiple dosings of medications, often leading to decreased compliance.
In conclusion, fatigue is an important quality of life
parameter in cancer patients, although it was not as prevalent in our population of men with prostate cancer as the
literature suggests. This is the first randomized placebocontrolled trial of a psychostimulant for fatigue in a prostate cancer population. Data from this study suggest that
methylphenidate is effective in treating fatigue in men
with prostate cancer; however, oncologists need to monitor these men regularly for possible pulse and blood pressure elevations.
