Abstract
The mitotic spindle checkpoint represents a signal transduction pathway that prevents the onset of anaphase until all
chromosomes are properly aligned on a metaphase plate.
Partial inactivation of this checkpoint allows premature
separation of sister chromatids and results in aneuploidy,
which might contribute to tumorigenesis. Unlike other cell
cycle checkpoints, the spindle checkpoint is essential for cell
viability, giving rise to the idea that the spindle checkpoint
itself might represent a valuable target for anticancer therapy.
We used a cell-based screen and identified the indolocarbazole
compound Gö6976 as a pharmacologic inhibitor of the spindle
checkpoint. Gö6976 potently overrides a spindle checkpoint–
mediated mitotic arrest by abrogating the phosphorylation
and kinetochore localization of several spindle checkpoint
proteins. We identified the Aurora-A and Aurora-B kinases,
which have been previously implicated in proper mitotic
progression and spindle checkpoint function, as targets for
Gö6976. Accordingly, Gö6976 treatment causes severe mitotic
abnormalities and chromosome alignment defects, which are
not properly detected by the drug-inactivated spindle checkpoint. This results in an aberrant progression of mitosis,
leading to apoptosis in various human cancer cell lines,
including spindle checkpoint–compromised cancer cells.
Thus, our work describes a novel and promising strategy for
anticancer treatment that targets the mitotic spindle checkpoint. [Cancer Res 2009;69(9):3874–83]

Introduction
Antimitotic drugs, including various taxanes and Vinca alkaloids,
are frequently used for anticancer treatment (1). It is well
established that these drugs activate the spindle assembly
checkpoint, a signal transduction pathway that monitors the
proper alignment of chromosomes during mitosis (2, 3). The druginduced and spindle checkpoint–mediated mitotic arrest is
followed by the induction of apoptosis, which occurs either in
mitosis or in the postmitotic G1 phase on escape from a prolonged
mitotic arrest (4). The latter decision might depend on two

separate pathways, which control the activation of caspases and
a slow but continuous degradation of cyclin B during mitosis,
respectively (5, 6). The drug-induced activation of caspases during
mitosis might be a key event required for efficient tumor cell killing
(6, 7), but the mechanisms leading to caspase activation remain
elusive. Interestingly, the mitotic spindle checkpoint is required for
the efficient induction of apoptosis on antimitotic drug treatment,
regardless of whether a cell dies in mitosis or in the subsequent G1
phase. Thus, compromising the mitotic spindle checkpoint results
in a significant decrease in sensitivity of tumor cells toward
antimitotic drugs (8–12). These findings were recently supported
by an unbiased small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen that identified
spindle checkpoint proteins as major determinants for the
sensitivity to paclitaxel (13). The molecular basis for a requirement
of the spindle checkpoint in the activation of the apoptotic
machinery is unclear, but it might be related to inhibition of Akt
during a mitotic arrest (13) or to a dephosphorylation and
activation of caspase-9 that requires a prolonged duration of
mitosis (14).
The spindle checkpoint pathway requires the function of various
proteins, including the kinases Bub1, BubR1, Mps1, Mad1, Mad2,
Bub3, and several others, which are recruited to kinetochores on
activation of the checkpoint (2, 3). Furthermore, inhibition of the
centromeric Aurora-B kinase or overexpression of the centrosomal
Aurora-A kinase led to spindle checkpoint malfunction (15–17).
Activation of the spindle checkpoint in response to misaligned
chromosomes either in the early phases of a regular mitosis or
chronically on antimitotic drug treatment causes the inhibition
of the ubiquitin ligase activity within the anaphase-promoting
complex/cyclosome (APC/C), which is required for the degradation
of various mitotic substrates, including securin and cyclin B.
Accordingly, failure of the spindle checkpoint results in a
premature separation of sister chromatids and an unscheduled
exit from mitosis, which leads to the generation of aneuploid
progenitors (2, 3).
In human cancer, a partial dysfunction of the spindle checkpoint (15, 18–22) is a frequent event and might contribute to
tumorigenesis (18, 23–28). In fact, mice heterozygous and
hypomorphic for spindle checkpoint genes show gross aneuploidy
and carcinogen-induced or spontaneous tumorigenesis (20, 29).
Importantly, the analyses of homozygous knockout mice as well as
siRNA studies in human cells revealed that the spindle checkpoint
is essential for cell viability (30–33). The essential nature of the
spindle checkpoint raises the interesting idea to use the spindle
checkpoint as a novel target for anticancer therapy.
To test this concept, we performed a cell-based screen and
identified the indolocarbazole Gö6976 that inhibits the mitotic
spindle checkpoint by restraining the phosphorylation and

Interestingly, we identified the mitotic Aurora-A and Aurora-B
kinases as targets for Gö6976 in vitro and in vivo and show that the
pharmacologic inactivation of the spindle checkpoint efficiently
kills human cancer cells.

Flow cytometry and determination of the mitotic index. The DNA
content and the mitotic index were determined as described (11).
Western blotting. Cell lysates were prepared, and SDS-PAGE, semidry
Western blotting, and detection were performed as described (11) using
the following antibodies: Bub1 (Bethyl; Stephen Taylor, University of
Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom), BubR1 (Chemicon; Stephen
Taylor), Bub3 (BD Biosciences), Mps1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Plk1
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Aurora-A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology; pT288:
Cell Signaling), Aurora-B (BD Biosciences; pT232: Cell Signaling), cyclin B
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), tubulin (Sigma), actin (Sigma), securin
(NeoMarkers), histone H3 (pS-10; Cell Signaling), and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase (PARP; Pharmingen). Signals were quantitated using the
ImageJ software (NIH).
Chromosome spread analysis. Premature sister chromatid separation
and karyotype analysis were performed as described (11).

Microscopy. Cells were fixed/permeabilized in 2% paraformaldehyde/
methanol and incubation with antibodies was carried out for 2 h. Images were
taken with a Leica DM6000B microscope and a charge-coupled device
camera (Orca-ER, Hamamatsu) with a Z-optical spacing of 0.2 Am. Images
were deconvolved using the Leica LAS-AF software and maximum projection
images are shown. Pixel quantitations of CREST and Bub1/BubR1 signals
on kinetochores were performed using the Leica LAS-AF software.
Kinase assays. In vitro kinase assays using recombinant Aurora kinases
(34) were performed for 30 min at 30jC in kinase buffer [50 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 7.7), 100 mmol/L KCl, 5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT] in the
presence of 50 to 2,000 Amol/L of ATP (Sigma), 1 ACi [32P]ATP (6,000 Ci/
mmol; Amersham), and 7 Ag MBP (Sigma). Substrate phosphorylation was
visualized by autoradiography and quantitated using a phosphoimager
(Fuji). For immunoprecipitation kinase assays, Aurora-A or Aurora-B was
immunoprecipitated from lysates and subjected to in vitro kinase assays.

HCT116 cells were treated with nocodazole (N ) or Taxol (T ) and incubated with DMSO (D ) or 2 Amol/L Gö6976 (G) in the presence or absence of 200 Amol/L ALLN (A ).
The mitotic index was determined (left ) and the protein levels of cyclin B and securin were determined on Western blot (right ). B, Gö6976 induces premature
sister chromatid separation. Nocodazole-arrested HCT116 cells were treated with DMSO or Gö6976 for 10 and 15 min and metaphase spreads were prepared.
Examples of typical metaphase spreads and the quantitation of cells showing premature sister chromatid separations (n = 400) are shown. C, Gö6976

with Hoechst dye. Pixel intensities for Bub1 and BubR1 at kinetochores were quantified relative to the CREST signals. The graphs represent quantitations from
80 kinetochores from six cells. D, Gö6976 inhibits phosphorylation of Bub1, Mps1, Aurora-A, and Aurora-B. Cells were treated as in C in the presence or absence of
ALLN and the indicated mitotic proteins were detected on Western blots. For each cell population, the mitotic index was determined.

Figure 3. Gö6976 causes chromosome alignment defects and premature and accelerated exit from mitosis. A, asynchronously growing HCT116 cells were treated
with 2 Amol/L Gö6976 for the indicated times and the DNA content and the mitotic index were determined. B, cells were treated with 2 Amol/L Gö6976 for 6 h and
fixed cells were stained for a-tubulin, CREST, and DNA. Typical examples of maximal projections of deconvolved Z-stacks are shown. C, HCT116 cells were
synchronized in mitosis by a nocodazole block and released into medium with or without 2 Amol/L Gö6976. At the indicated time points, cells were fixed and
stained for a-tubulin and DNA. D, cells were treated as in C and the DNA content and the mitotic index were determined. Representative FACS profiles are shown.
Points, mean of at least three independent experiments; bars, SD.

Apoptosis assays. Caspase activity assays, detection of PARP cleavage,
and chromosomal DNA fragmentation assays as well as determination of
the sub-G1 DNA content were performed as described previously (11). For
caspase inhibition, the pan-caspase inhibitor Boc-D-FMK (100 Amol/L;
Calbiochem) was used.

Results
Identification of the indolocarbazole compound Gö6976
as a potent abrogator of a spindle damage–induced mitotic
arrest. We performed a cell-based screen, in which HCT116 cells
were first treated with nocodazole to arrest cells in mitosis in a
spindle checkpoint–dependent manner. Subsequently, cells were
treated with small-molecule inhibitors followed by determination
of the mitotic index to monitor the mitotic arrest (Fig. 1A).
Because several kinases are involved in spindle checkpoint
signaling, we screened commercially available protein kinase
1inhibitors, including established inhibitors for PKA, protein
kinase C (PKC), cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK), Chk1, mitogen-

activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase,
p38, Raf, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Fig. 1B). Among
the small-molecule inhibitors tested, we identified the indolocarbazole Gö6976 (Supplementary Fig. S1A) as a compound that
potently abrogated the induced mitotic arrest and forced cells to
exit mitosis with a 4N DNA content (Fig. 1B and C). In HCT116
and HeLa cells, Gö6976 showed a half-maximal effect at 0.8 to
1.2 Amol/L in the presence of nocodazole and Taxol, which is
f25 times more potent than the CDK1 inhibitor roscovitine in
abrogating the mitotic arrest (Fig. 1D). Very similar results were
obtained after treatment with the KSP/Eg5 inhibitor monastrol
and in various human cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1B and C).
We also tested established structurally related and similarly
potent PKC inhibitors (Ro31-8220 and Ro32-0432) as well as the
structurally unrelated PKC inhibitor rottlerin and found no effect
on the spindle damage–induced mitotic arrest, suggesting that
Gö6976 acts independently of PKC inhibition. In addition, other
indolocarbazole compounds, including UCN-01 or staurosporine,

had no or little effects on the spindle damage–induced mitotic
arrest (Fig. 1B). No significant inhibition of CDK1 by Gö6976 was
observed (Supplementary Fig. S1D).
Gö6976 inhibits the mitotic spindle checkpoint. In the
presence of nocodazole or Taxol, treatment with 2 Amol/L
Gö6976 induced a rapid exit from mitosis, which was associated
with the rapid degradation of cyclin B and securin that could be
blocked by the proteasome inhibitor ALLN, indicating that Gö6976
relieves the inhibition of the APC/C (Fig. 2A). Gö6976 allowed the
entry into mitosis but suppressed the accumulation of mitotic
cells in the presence of nocodazole, whereas roscovitine treatment
prevented the entry into mitosis (Supplementary Fig. S2A).
Furthermore, premature exit from mitosis led to endoreduplication
(Supplementary Fig. S2B), which is associated with spindle
checkpoint impairment as shown previously (35). Gö6976 treatment forced cells out of mitosis and a single nucleus with a 4N

DNA content was reformed, whereas CDK inhibitors caused a high
rate of multinucleation (Supplementary Fig. S2C), supporting the
notion that Gö6976 acts independently from CDK1.
Consistent with a spindle checkpoint inhibition by Gö6976, we
found a high rate of premature chromatid separation on Gö6976
treatment (Fig. 2B). Prolonged treatment led to a significant increase
in aneuploid cells, whereas the overall cell cycle progression was not
significantly disturbed (Supplementary Fig. S2D and E), although
dead cells became increasingly apparent.
Gö6976 inhibits the proper phosphorylation and localization of spindle checkpoint proteins. We investigated whether
Gö6976 interferes with the localization or amount and
phosphorylation of spindle checkpoint proteins. Significantly,
Gö6976 treatment reduced the kinetochore localization of Bub1
and BubR1 by f80% (Fig. 2C). Aurora-B was also found to be
mislocalized from the centromere region to chromosome arms

cells treated with nocodazole, ALLN, and 1 or 2 Amol/L of Gö6976 and their kinase activities were determined. Columns, mean of at least three independent

Spindle Checkpoint Inhibition Induces Apoptosis

Figure 5. The aberrant progression through mitosis
induced by Gö6976 causes apoptosis in human cancer
cells. A, Gö6976-induced apoptosis requires progression
through mitosis. HCT116 cells were synchronized at the
G1-S transition by a double-thymidine block and released
into fresh medium. Seven hours after release, cells were
treated with various concentrations of Gö6976, roscovitine,
or roscovitine plus Gö6976, and another 7 h later,
caspase-3 activity was determined. B, Gö6976-induced
apoptosis is dependent on caspase activity. HCT116 cells
were treated with 20 Amol/L Gö6976 in the presence or
absence of 100 Amol/L Boc-D-FMK for 24 and 48 h and the
DNA content and proportion of apoptotic cells were
determined. Representative FACS profiles are shown. C,
Gö6976 induces caspase activity in various human cancer
cell lines. The indicated human cancer cell lines and two
nontransformed cell lines were treated with 15 Amol/L
Gö6976 for 24 h and caspase-3 activity was measured in
intact cells. D, synergistic effect of Taxol and Gö6976.
HCT116 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L Taxol for
14 h followed by the addition of DMSO or 2 Amol/L Gö6976
for additional 2 h. The DNA content was determined by
FACS analyses and representative DNA profiles and
quantitation of apoptotic cells are shown. E, quantitative

on Gö6976 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3), whereas Aurora-A
retained its centrosomal localization (data not shown). Furthermore, on Western blots, we found that the hyperphosphorylation
of Bub1, Mps1, Aurora-A, and Aurora-B, which is closely
associated with spindle checkpoint activation, was abolished
on Gö6976 treatment both on forced exit from mitosis and in
mitotic cells (Fig. 2D).
Gö6976 causes aberrant spindle morphology and chromosome alignment defects. Next, we investigated the mitotic
progression in the presence of Gö6976. Treatment of asynchronously growing HCT116 cells with 2 Amol/L Gö6976 resulted in
a transient accumulation of mitotic cells (Fig. 3A) and this was
associated with profound alterations in the spindle structure and
severely misaligned chromosomes (Fig. 3B). The spindles often
seemed cylindrical and flattened and groups of chromosomes

www.aacrjournals.org

were frequently found near the spindle poles, suggesting that
those chromosomes are not properly attached to microtubules.
Similar chromosome alignment defects were observed when cells
were released from a monastrol block into Gö6976 (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
Remarkably, the severe alignment defects induced by Gö6976 did
not cause a robust mitotic arrest as would be expected in the
presence of a functional spindle checkpoint. Instead, the accumulation of mitotic cells was only weak and transient (Fig. 3A) but
dependent on the spindle checkpoint (Supplementary Fig. S4B),
suggesting that the mitotic arrest cannot be maintained, possibly
mediated by Gö6976-induced spindle checkpoint inhibition.
Gö6976 accelerates exit from an aberrant mitosis. To test
whether Gö6976 treatment indeed allows an exit from mitosis in
the presence of unaligned chromosomes, we released cells from a

nocodazole block in the presence or absence of Gö6976 and
followed the progression through mitosis qualitatively by immunofluorescence (Fig. 3C) and quantitatively by monitoring the
mitotic index (Fig. 3D). Whereas control cells progressed normally
through mitosis and exited mitosis properly, Gö6976-treated cells
exhibited a significant acceleration of mitotic progression and
exited from mitosis in the presence of misaligned chromosomes.
Most Gö6976-treated cells underwent cytokinesis despite the
presence of unaligned and missegregated chromosomes, producing
daughter cells with highly unequal DNA content (Fig. 3D, top). By
the end of mitosis, apoptotic cells became readily apparent,
suggesting that the severe missegregation observed causes cell
death (Fig. 3C).
The mitotic Aurora-A and Aurora-B kinases are inhibited by
Gö6976 in vitro and in vivo. To gain insights into the mitotic
target kinase of Gö6976, we evaluated candidate mitotic kinases
known to be involved in spindle checkpoint function. Because we
observed a lack of phosphorylation of Bub1, Mps1, Aurora-A,
and Aurora-B (Fig. 2D), which might relate to their functional
inactivation, we evaluated these kinases in particular. In vitro, no

inhibition of Bub1, Mps1, Plk1, and p38 by Gö6976 was found.
However, Aurora-B kinase activity was significantly inhibited by
Gö6976 in these assays (Fig. 4A). We determined the IC50 values for
Gö6976 and ZM447439, which is a potent and well-characterized
inhibitor for Aurora-A and Aurora-B kinases in vitro (36), and
found that Gö6976 inhibited Aurora-B with similar potency as
ZM447439 (100 versus 80 nmol/L at 50 Amol/L ATP; Fig. 4B).
However, our analyses revealed that Gö6976 was nearly five times
more potent than ZM447439 in inhibiting the Aurora-A kinase (120
versus 580 nmol/L at 50 Amol/L ATP; Fig. 4B). As expected for
an ATP-competitive inhibitor, the inhibitory activity of
Gö6976 decreased with higher ATP concentrations (Supplementary
Fig. S5A; Supplementary Text). To test whether Gö6976 also inhibits
the Aurora kinases in vivo, we evaluated the activation loop–
specific phosphorylation of Aurora-A and Aurora-B kinases (pT288
for Aurora-A and pT232 for Aurora-B), which is indicative of their
activation. In agreement with previous data (36), treatment of
mitotic cells with ZM447439 abolished selectively the activation of
cellular Aurora-B (75% inhibition) but left the activity of Aurora-A
unchanged. However, in agreement with our in vitro data, Gö6976

HCT116 and HT29 cells were arrested in
mitosis by treatment with 150 nmol/L
nocodazole for 16 h followed by the
addition of different concentrations of
Gö6976. After 2 h of incubation, the mitotic
index was determined. B, reduced caspase
activation in HT29 cells on Gö6976
treatment. HCT116 and HT29 cells were
synchronized at G1-S and released into the
cell cycle. Seven hours after release, cells
were treated with various concentrations of
Gö6976 and the activity of caspase-3
was determined after 7 h of treatment.
C, spindle checkpoint–compromised
cancer cells show reduced caspase
activation on spindle damage. HCT116 and
isogenic derivatives expressing
lower levels of Mad2 (HCT116-MAD2 +/ )
or Mad1 (HCT-MAD1-kd) were treated
with 150 nmol/L nocodazole for 38 h and
caspase-3 activity was determined in
intact cells. D, Gö6976 reduces the
already lowered mitotic arrest in spindle
checkpoint–compromised cancer
cells on spindle damage. Spindle
checkpoint–compromised and parental
HCT116 cells were treated with
150 nmol/L nocodazole in the presence or
absence of 2 Amol/L Gö6976 and the
mitotic index was determined at various
time points. E, activation of caspase-3 in
spindle checkpoint–compromised cancer
cells in response to Gö6976 treatment. The
indicated HCT116 cell lines were treated
with different Gö6976 concentrations and
the induction of caspase-3 activity was
determined. Columns, mean of at least
three independent experiments; bars, SD.

treatment inhibited the activity of both Aurora-A and Aurora-B,
with similar potency in vivo (60% and 58% inhibition, respectively;
Fig. 4C; Supplementary Fig. S5B).
We also determined the activity of Aurora-A and Aurora-B
immunoprecipitated from drug-treated cells. Again, Gö6976
treatment caused significant inhibition of Aurora-A and Aurora-B
(Fig. 4D), whereas immunoprecipitated CDK1-cyclin B complexes
were not inhibited by Gö6976 (Supplementary Fig. S5C). These
results provide strong evidence that Gö6976 is a potent inhibitor of
Aurora-A and Aurora-B in vitro and in vivo, although we cannot
exclude the possibility that Gö6976 targets additional kinases
during mitosis.
In addition to its crucial function in chromosome alignment
and spindle checkpoint function, Aurora-B is also required for
cytokinesis (16). Indeed, treatment of asynchronously growing cells
with ZM447439 prevents cytokinesis and results in profound
polyploidization. Surprisingly, although Gö6976 inhibits Aurora-B
in vivo, neither profound defects in cytokinesis nor polyploidization
was detected (Supplementary Fig. S6).
The aberrant progression through mitosis induced by
Gö6976 causes apoptosis in tumor cells. To test whether the
Gö6976-induced aberrant progression of mitosis causes apoptosis,
we synchronized HCT116 cells at G1-S, treated the cells with
Gö6976 before entry into mitosis, and evaluated the activation
of caspase-3 in intact cells. Indeed, Gö6976 treatment induced
caspase-3 activity, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation after
progression through a single mitosis and this was significantly
suppressed when entry into mitosis was prevented by inhibiting
CDK1 (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S7A). Further, Gö6976-induced
apoptosis was caspase dependent (Fig. 5B).
We treated 15 human cell lines with Gö6976 and found a
significant but varying induction of caspase activity in most cancer
cell lines (Fig. 5C), whereas nontransformed human cells (human
BJ-hTert fibroblasts and primary human umbilical vein endothelial
cells) exhibited low caspase-3 activity. The reason for the different
sensitivities observed is not known at present but could be
recapitulated in colony formation assays comparing the sensitivity
of HeLa and BJ-hTert fibroblasts toward Gö6976 (Supplementary
Fig. S7B; Supplementary Text). Accordingly, we found that HeLa
and HCT116 cancer cells showed a higher rate of cell killing than
BJ-hTert fibroblasts after treatment with Gö6976 (Supplementary
Fig. S7C and D). We also compared the efficacy of Gö6976 with
ZM447439 and Taxol and found a higher efficacy of Taxol but a
lower efficacy of ZM447439 toward HeLa and HCT116 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S7D and E).
Gö6976 acts synergistically with Taxol. Recent data showed
that the efficacy of antimitotic drugs could be greatly enhanced
by subsequent inactivation of the spindle checkpoint (7, 37). To
investigate whether Taxol and a Gö6976-mediated inactivation of
the spindle checkpoint act synergistically, cells were treated for
14 hours with Taxol to arrest cells in mitosis followed by treatment
with Gö6976 to induce exit from mitosis. In fact, a synergistic effect
of Gö6976 and Taxol was clearly observed (Fig. 5D and E). It is
important to note that a reversed order of drug treatment caused
an inhibition of the spindle checkpoint before Taxol treatment and
reduced sensitivity toward Taxol (data not shown; Supplementary
Fig. S2B; refs. 11, 35, 38).
A spindle checkpoint override is required for efficacy of
Gö6976. To investigate if the efficacy of Gö6976 requires the
override of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, we took advantage of a
human colon carcinoma cell line, HT29, which exhibits a very

www.aacrjournals.org

strong and prolonged mitotic arrest in response to spindle damage
compared with most cancer cell lines, including HCT116 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Accordingly, Gö6976 could only weakly
override the spindle checkpoint in HT29 cells (Fig. 6A), which was
directly associated with resistance toward Gö6976 (Fig. 6B),
suggesting that the spindle checkpoint override is directly
associated with the sensitivity toward Gö6976. It is important to
note that HT29 cells are not resistant per se because they are
capable of inducing apoptosis on chemotherapeutic treatment
(data not shown).
Targeting of spindle checkpoint–compromised cancer cells
by Gö6976. Several reports have indicated that the spindle
checkpoint is required for the efficient induction of cell death after
treatment with antimitotic drugs (8, 9, 11, 12, 39). Accordingly, spindle
checkpoint–compromised HCT116 cells with lowered expression of
MAD1 or MAD2 showed a lowered mitotic arrest and reduced
caspase-3 activity in response to nocodazole treatment (Fig. 6C;
ref. 11). In both spindle checkpoint–impaired cell lines, Gö6976
treatment further lowered the mitotic arrest in response to spindle
damage (Fig. 6D) and induced caspase-3 activity similar to parental
cells (Fig. 6E), suggesting that spindle checkpoint–compromised
cancer cells are sensitive toward Gö6976 treatment.

Discussion
Due to its essential nature, the spindle checkpoint has been
suggested as a potential novel anticancer drug target (32, 33). We
wished to prove this conceptual idea and have identified the
indolocarbazole Gö6976 as an inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint.
Importantly, we show that this inhibitor induces a highly aberrant
and accelerated mitosis that results in efficient killing of human
cancer cells. Thus, we propose to add the spindle checkpoint to the
growing list of attractive mitotic drug targets.
The ‘‘classic’’ mitotic drug target is the mitotic spindle, whose
function is inhibited by microtubule-targeting drugs including
various taxanes or Vinca alkaloids (40). However, due to the
ability to inhibit microtubule function in interphase or even in
differentiated cells, a plethora of unwanted side effects, including
neutropenia and neuropathy, is observed after treatment with
these drugs. Therefore, novel mitotic drug targets that function
exclusively in mitosis, including the Plk1 and the Aurora kinases,
but also mitotic Eg5/KSP or Cenp-E kinesins, have gained
considerable interest (1, 41). Similarly, no function for the mitotic
spindle checkpoint pathway outside of mitosis has been described
thus far. Thus, inhibition of the spindle checkpoint is expected to
have no effect on interphase or differentiated cells. However, it is
important to note that targeting mitosis per se might harbor the
risk of chromosome missegregation in surviving cells that could
contribute to de novo tumorigenesis.
At present, is not clear how antimitotic drugs induce tumor
cell death. Most recent results have indicated that cells activate
caspase-dependent pathways during mitosis and die either in
mitosis or on an unscheduled exit from mitosis (5–7). However,
it is unknown how caspases are activated on drug treatment,
but the activation of the spindle checkpoint associated with a
transient mitotic delay seems to be necessary for the efficient
induction of cell death (8–13). Interestingly, during mitosis,
caspase-9 is inhibited by CDK1/cyclin B–mediated phosphorylation. Prolonged mitotic arrest, which requires the spindle
checkpoint, may lead to a progressive dephosphorylation,
activation of caspase-9, and the induction of apoptosis, thereby

providing a timer mechanism monitoring the length of mitosis
(14). In contrast to this mechanism, we show here when
targeting the spindle checkpoint pathway that the induction of
apoptosis is not dependent on a functional spindle checkpoint.
Similarly, because Aurora-B is required for the spindle checkpoint, ZM447439 also induces spindle checkpoint–independent
apoptosis.3 Thus, the therapeutic concept of spindle checkpoint
inhibition is expected to be efficient in tumor cells harboring a
compromised spindle checkpoint.
We show that Gö6976 targets the mitotic Aurora kinases, which
might explain the phenotypes observed after treatment with
Gö6976. Gö6976 treatment causes spindle formation defects and
severe chromosome misalignment, phenotypes attributable to
Aurora-A inhibition (42). In addition, inhibition of Aurora-B might
explain the checkpoint override in the presence of misaligned
chromosomes because Aurora-B has been implicated in spindle
checkpoint function (36, 43). Thus, the efficacy of Gö6976 might
depend on a two-step mechanism: first, the induction of mitotic
damage associated with a transient mitotic delay, and second, the
override of the spindle checkpoint allowing exit from an aberrant
mitosis. The latter might be particularly supportive for the
induction of apoptosis. In fact, when tumor cells are first treated
with Taxol followed by the inactivation of the spindle checkpoint,
the induction of cell death is greatly enhanced (Fig. 5; refs. 7, 37).
Interestingly, the reverse order of events, Taxol treatment of cells
in which the spindle checkpoint is already inhibited, led to
endoreduplication and a reduced sensitivity toward Taxol3 (13, 35,
38), suggesting that a therapeutic combination of Taxol and spindle
checkpoint inhibitors strictly depends on the order of drug
treatment.
Although we show that Gö6976 inhibits Aurora-B in vitro and
in vivo, we found some remarkable differences to the inhibition by

selective Aurora-B inhibitors, including ZM447439 or hesperadin
(36, 43). Whereas ZM447439 and hesperadin inhibit selectively a
Taxol-induced spindle checkpoint, Gö6976 overrides the spindle
checkpoint on Taxol or nocodazole treatment. Moreover, in
contrast to ZM447439 or hesperadin, Gö6976 did not cause defects
in cytokinesis or induce polyploidization. At present, we cannot
explain these interesting differences, but they might be related to
the concomitant inhibition of Aurora-A by Gö6976 or due to
different inhibitor selectivity for distinct Aurora-B–containing
protein complexes.
Previous work has identified the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase
inhibitor SP600125 as an inhibitor of the spindle checkpoint kinase
Mps1 (44). Remarkably, SP600125-mediated inhibition of Mps1 led
to an inactivation of the spindle checkpoint in cancer cells but not
in nontransformed fibroblasts. Although we have not investigated
the spindle checkpoint activity in nontransformed cells, we found
that Gö6976 killed many cancer cells more efficiently than
nontransformed human cells. The molecular basis for this
selectivity is not clear at present but deserves further detailed
investigation in future studies.
