ABSTRACT
PTEN loss is prognostic for patient relapse post-radiotherapy in prostate cancer
(CaP). Infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) is associated with reduced
disease-free survival following radical prostatectomy. However, the association
between PTEN loss, TAM infiltration and radiotherapy response of CaP cells remains
to be evaluated. Immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of surgically-resected
Gleason 7 tumors confirmed that PTEN loss correlated with increased CXCL8 expression
and macrophage infiltration. However PTEN status had no discernable correlation
with expression of other inflammatory markers by CaP cells, including TNF-α. In vitro,
exposure to conditioned media harvested from irradiated PTEN null CaP cells induced
chemotaxis of macrophage-like THP-1 cells, a response partially attenuated by
CXCL8 inhibition. Co-culture with THP-1 cells resulted in a modest reduction in the
radio-sensitivity of DU145 cells. Cytokine profiling revealed constitutive secretion of
TNF-α from CaP cells irrespective of PTEN status and IR-induced TNF-α secretion from
THP-1 cells. THP-1-derived TNF-α increased NFκB pro-survival activity and elevated
expression of anti-apoptotic proteins including cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1
(cIAP-1) in CaP cells, which could be attenuated by pre-treatment with a TNF-α
neutralizing antibody. Treatment with a novel IAP antagonist, AT-IAP, decreased basal
and TNF-α-induced cIAP-1 expression in CaP cells, switched TNF-α signaling from prosurvival to pro-apoptotic and increased radiation sensitivity of CaP cells in co-culture
with THP-1 cells. We conclude that targeting cIAP-1 can overcome apoptosis resistance
of CaP cells and is an ideal approach to exploit high TNF-α signals within the TAM-rich
microenvironment of PTEN-deficient CaP cells to enhance response to radiotherapy.

INTRODUCTION

following RT [4]. Furthermore, we have previously
identified the chemokine CXCL8 as a mediator of
PTEN-deficient tumorigenesis [5].
The revised “Hallmarks of Cancer” emphasizes
the importance of the tumor microenvironment in
tumorigenesis [6]. An increasing number of reports
also highlight the impact of microenvironment-derived
inflammatory cytokine signaling or stromal-derived
pro-angiogenic signals in driving radioresistance
[7, 8]. Surprisingly, knowledge of microenvironmentmediated radioresistance in CaP is poorly characterized

Radiotherapy (RT) constitutes a major treatment
modality used in patients presenting with localized
prostate cancer (CaP) [1]. Despite RT and surgery
being curative in up to 50% of patients, approximately
one third of men will exhibit biochemical recurrence
and disease progression towards fatal castrate-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC) [2, 3]. Loss of the
haplo-insufficient tumor suppressor PTEN has recently
been identified as a prognostic factor for patient relapse

but given the strong association of inflammation with the
disease, there is a high potential that the immune cell
infiltrate may modulate the overall tumor response to RT
in early-stage disease. Tumor-associated macrophages
(TAM) have been identified as a significant component of
the inflammatory cell infiltrate in CaP and may influence
disease progression through their ability to release soluble
signaling factors within the tumor boundaries [9, 10]. TAM
infiltration has previously been correlated with disease
free survival (DFS) following radical prostatectomy (RP)
(11–13). However, no such studies have been reported
regarding RT response.
TNF-α is a cytokine primarily produced by
macrophages and activates the extrinsic apoptosis pathway
following its binding to cell surface death receptors on
tumor cells [11, 12]. CaP cells are notoriously resistant to
the action of TNF-α, and rather than promoting apoptosis,
TNF-α instead preferentially promotes the activation
of NFκB-dependent pro-survival signaling [13, 14].
This switch from death-promoting to survival signaling
is regulated by the expression and function of the cellular
inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 and -2 (cIAP-1 and cIAP-2)
(18). Overexpression of cIAP-1 may therefore underpin
resistance of CaP cells to TNF-α. In addition, therapeutic
targeting of cIAP-1 may serve as a potent strategy to
sensitize CaP cells to TNF-α mediated cell death.
Under normal conditions, cIAP-1 expression is
tightly regulated by the action of mitochondrial protein
Smac. Loss of mitochondrial membrane permeability
results in release of Smac into the cytosol where it can
induce proteosomal degradation of cIAP-1 and cIAP-2,
whilst directly inhibiting XIAP [15, 16]. Dysfunctional
Smac-mediated regulation of apoptosis is a common feature
in malignant disease and has resulted in the development
of a novel class of drugs known as Smac-mimetics
[17, 18]. AT-IAP is a dual cIAP-1 and XIAP antagonist
which has demonstrated pre-clinical efficacy, in
combination with the histone deacetylase inhibitor
vorinostat, in models of mesothelioma [19].
This study aimed to determine the impact of TAM
infiltration, and specifically the effects of treatment-induced
TNFα signaling in modulating RT response of CaP
cells. We show that administration of the c-IAP/x-IAP
antagonist, AT-IAP, directs a pro-apoptotic response to
TNF-α signaling, increasing the sensitivity of prostate
cancer cells to RT. Furthermore, this raises the potential to
utilize radiotherapy beyond the localized stage of disease.

cell-line-derived data, we conducted a molecular analysis
on 28 surgically-resected Gleason 7 tumors to establish
the correlation of PTEN status against CXCL8 gene
expression. Molecular profiling by high throughput
gene expression discriminated these samples into two
cohorts, stratified on either high or low PTEN expression.
Validation experiments confirmed separation of these
distinct PTEN populations using RT-PCR analysis of
mRNA expression (p < 0.001; Figure 1A). Cytokine
profiling of these samples confirmed that low PTEN
mRNA expression was correlative with increased CXCL8
mRNA (Spearman correlation: −0.5088; p = 0.0261)
(Figure 1B). Conversely, subsequent profiling of these
macro-dissected tumor samples confirmed that PTEN
status did not correlate with significant changes in intrinsic
expression of other cytokines including IL-6 (Spearman
correlation: −0.1091; p = 0.6378) (Figure 1C). Other
cytokines analyzed included CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5
(data not shown).

CXCL8 induces chemotaxis of radioresistancepromoting THP1’s in a PTEN-deficient setting
CXCL8 was initially characterized as a potent
chemoattractant for leukocyte-derived immune cells [22].
Given the up-regulation of CXCL8 expression detected
in PTEN-deficient tumors, further IHC analysis was
performed to characterize the levels of CD68-positive
macrophages detected within prostate patient samples
(Figure 2A). Moderate to dense infiltration of
CD68-positive macrophages was correlated with loss
of PTEN protein expression across 70 analyzable cases
(p < 0.05). Lower levels of macrophage infiltration were
detected within PTEN-positive tumors (Figure 2B).
In vitro assays confirmed the function of CXCL8 in
potentiating chemotactic migration of THP-1 cells, used
in this context as a representative macrophage-like cell
[243 ± 66% above baseline migration towards
serum-free medium; (Figure 2C)]. Furthermore, our assays
demonstrated that the conditioned media (CM) harvested
from irradiated PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells was capable
of inducing THP-1 chemotaxis, and that this response
could be partially inhibited following pre-treatment with
a CXCL8 neutralizing antibody; however, this effect was
not observed in PTEN-expressing NT01 cells (Figure 2D).
Irradiating CaP cells can induce release of a multitude of
cytokines (data not shown) and therefore total inhibition
of cell migration may not be possible without considering
this extensive signaling network.
To establish how macrophage infiltration may affect
therapeutic response, colony formation assays were used
to characterize radiation sensitivity of PTEN-modulated
DU145 cells, cultured in the presence or absence of THP-1
cells. Co-culture with THP-1 cells increased the resistance
of both PTEN-positive NT01 and PTEN-deficient Sh11.02
cells to ionizing radiation (IR), with calculated dose

IR induces secretion of TNF-α from THP-1 cells
but not from CaP cells

enhancement factors (DEF) of 0.89 and 0.87, respectively.
The equivalent degree of sensitization observed suggests
that the mechanism of macrophage-afforded resistance
was independent of the intrinsic PTEN status of the
CaP cells (Figure 2E and 2F). These experiments were
repeated in the PTEN-null PC3 cell line and although
showing a trend towards monocyte-driven radioresistance
at the higher dose points, no significant difference in
radiosensitivity was observed (Supplementary Figure 1A).
This was also the case when PTEN expression was
reconstituted under the control of a tetracycline-inducible
promoter (Supplementary Figure 1B).

Alongside CXCL8, the cytokine TNF-α has recently
been implicated with reduced overall survival and time to
castration resistance in CaP patients [23]. Therefore the
linkage of PTEN status to TNF-α expression in malignant
prostate cells was also determined. Analysis of DU145
NT01 and Sh11.02 cells indicated that loss of PTEN
had no effect on TNF-α secretion or mRNA levels in
these isogenic lines (Supplementary Figure 2A and 2B).
Furthermore, analysis of patient samples confirmed no

correlation between PTEN mRNA levels and TNF-α gene
expression (Spearman correlation: −0.1175; p = 0.6318)
(Figure 3A). Since we observed no intrinsic correlation
of PTEN with TNF-α expression, experimental results
shown are derived from analysis of the PTEN-deficient
Sh11.02 cell line while corresponding results derived from
PTEN-positive NT01 cells presented in Supplementary
Figures 2, 3 and 4.
The effect of radiation exposure upon TNF-α
secretion in CaP cells was also determined. Treatment
of PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells with 3 Gy IR did not
augment TNF-α secretion levels compared to time-matched
control samples, ranging from between 20–80 pg/ml/106
cells across a 24 h time course (Figure 3B). Ionizing
radiation also had no effect on TNF-α mRNA or protein
expression (Supplementary Figure 2) or on expression
of tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR-1) in these
cells (Figure 3C). Consistent with the secretion of
TNF-α and capacity of DU145 Sh11.02 cells and DU145
NT01 cells to respond in an autocrine manner, addition
of 10 ng/ml recombinant-human TNF-α (rh-TNF-α)
had a minimal impact on radiation sensitivity as determined
in clonogenic assays (Supplementary Figure 5).
Macrophages are a rich source of pro-inflammatory
TNF-α. Justified by the enrichment of CD68-positive
macrophages detected by IHC in PTEN-deficient prostate
tumors, we assessed how exposure to IR modulated
TNF-α secretion from THP-1 cells. Treatment with 3
Gy IR promoted a rapid increase in the level of TNF-α
secretion observed, with a 21.09 ± 5.5 fold increase
evident within 30 min of exposure (Figure 3D).
In addition, we also characterized whether the secretion of
CXCL8 from PTEN-deficient tumor cells may affect the
level of macrophage-derived TNF-α secretion. Treatment
with recombinant human-CXCL8 (rh-CXCL8; 3 nM)
was shown to induce the secretion of TNF-α from
THP-1’s, though secretion levels were shown to peak as a
consequence of prolonged stimulation (Figure 3E). Thus
the release of CXCL8 from the PTEN-deficient tumor cells
may also potentiate the IR-induced, macrophage-derived
elevation of TNF-α signaling within the microenvironment
of PTEN-deficient tumors.

but not abrogated in the presence of a TNF-α neutralizing
antibody (p < 0.05; Figure 4A). Similar results were
observed in the PTEN-expressing DU145 NT01 cell line
(Supplementary Figure 3B).
The effect of NFκB activation on the expression
of downstream pro-survival effectors was evaluated by
immunoblotting. Of the proteins analyzed, only basal
expression of Bcl-2 was different between unstimulated
PTEN-expressing NT01 and PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells
(Figure 4B). To model the effects of radiation-induced
TNF-α secretion from THP-1 cells, we stimulated
Sh11.02 cells with a 10 ng/ml bolus of rhTNF-α over
a 24 h time course. Analysis of Sh11.02 protein lysates
identified that rhTNF-α increased the expression of several
anti-apoptotic proteins including c-FLIP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2
and Bcl-2, whilst having no effect on levels of caspase 8
(Figure 4C). Furthermore, exposure of our Sh11.02/THP-1
co-culture system to 3 Gy IR further elevated the
expression of c-FLIP (L) and noticeably increased cIAP-1
levels after 4 h (Figure 4D). Interestingly, this increase in
cIAP-1 expression could be prevented by pre-treating with
a TNF-α neutralizing antibody.
Given the coupling of TNF-α signaling to
pro-survival protein expression, we conducted colony
count assays to determine whether repression of
IR-induced, macrophage-derived TNF-α signaling
could influence cell survival. Administration of a
neutralizing antibody to TNF-α failed to decrease cell
survival at clinically-relevant doses of IR in either
the DU145 NT01 or Sh11.02 cells (Supplementary
Figure 5B and 5D respectively). However, a
degree of enhancement was seen to high dose IR
at levels which are currently under investigation in
hypo-fractionation protocols.

AT-IAP induces CaP cell apoptosis through
inhibition of cIAP-1
Determining that TNF-α signaling preferentially
induced a NFκB pro-survival phenotype raised the
potential of targeting upregulated transcriptional targets
of this pathway. One of these anti-apoptotic regulators
was cIAP1; a protein which is normally under tight
regulation via the ability of mitochondrial Smac to
induce proteosomal degradation. AT-IAP is a novel dual
antagonist of cIAP and XIAP and leads to degradation
of cIAP-1. Treatment of DU145 Sh11.02 cells with 0.1,
1 or 10 µM AT-IAP for 4 h significantly reduced cIAP-1
protein expression (Figure 5A). Addition of TNF-α
or monotherapy with AT-IAP had no effect on the
cell viability of PTEN-deficient DU145 Sh11.02 cells
as determined by MTT assay. However, concurrent
administration of TNF-α and AT-IAP reduced cell
viability by 44.2 ± 6.5% (p < 0.05; Figure 5B). Annexin
V-detection by flow cytometry (72 h) and quantitative
caspase 3/7 assays (24 h) confirmed that the combination

Experiments were conducted to evaluate how
addition of THP-1 cells affected the degree of NFκB
activation observed in DU145 Sh11.02 cells, in the
absence and presence of radiation. Co-culture with
THP-1 cells alone increased the level of NFκB activity
within Sh11.02 cells by 60.1 ± 7.8% (p < 0.01). However,
irradiation of the DU145 Sh11.02/THP-1 co-culture model
promoted a 233.6 ± 44.3% increase in NFκB activity, as
detected by luciferase reporter assays (p < 0.01). The

promotion of apoptosis relative to control. Combination
therapy with rhTNF-α and AT-IAP increased the AnnexinV-positive cell population by 17.8 ± 4.02% over controls,
and induced a 4.7 ± 0.26 fold increase in caspase 3/7
activity (p < 0.01; Figure 5C and 5D). Consistent with
their inability to significantly impact cell viability in MTT
assays, administration of rhTNF-α or AT-IAP alone did
not significantly increase apoptosis induction. Similar
results were obtained for all these experiments in PTENexpressing DU145 NT01 cells (Supplementary Figure 4).

presence of macrophages and exposed to IR, was
assessed by immunoblotting assays. Treatment with 1 µM
AT-IAP for 4 h was sufficient to reverse 3 Gy IR and
microenvironment-driven, THP-1 mediated increases in
cIAP-1 expression (Figure 6A). The addition of AT-IAP
and the potent down-regulation of cIAP-1 was sufficient
in elevating caspase 3/7 activity, in the presence of the
radiation-induced TNF-α release within the co-culture
system (Figure 6B). Furthermore, addition of AT-IAP
increased the radiation sensitivity of DU145 Sh11.02 cells
in the presence of THP-1 cells, resulting in a calculated
DEF of 1.53 (p < 0.001; Figure 6C). Interestingly,
this effect was only partially knocked back following
addition of a TNF-α neutralizing antibody (p < 0.001),
suggesting that other monocyte-derived secreted factors
may by influencing CaP cell radiosensitivity. AT-IAP also
enhanced the radiation sensitivity of PTEN-expressing
DU145 NT01 cells (Supplementary Figure 4E).

DISCUSSION

macrophage infiltration may also be inhibited by blockade
of CXCL8 signaling. Through immunohistochemical
analysis of human prostate cancer tissue, we have
demonstrated that loss of PTEN-expression correlates
with a greater incidence of macrophage infiltration.
Previous studies have discussed the potential relevance of
TAMs in patients treated by RP [25, 26]. Using optimized
in vitro systems, we have shown that co-culture with
macrophage representative THP-1 cells increased the
radio-resistance of CaP cells, suggesting that the higher
level of macrophage infiltration in PTEN-deficient tumors
may underpin their adverse prognosis with respect to
radiotherapy (4).
Founded on the detection of macrophage enrichment
in PTEN-deficient prostate tumors, we evaluated how
the cellular compartments, studied in isolation and in
co-culture responded to clinically-relevant doses of IR.
Cytokine arrays were conducted to determine how

Loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN is prevalent
in men presenting with organ-confined prostate cancer
and has prognostic value towards predicting poor
response to radiotherapy [4]. We have previously shown
that impairment of PTEN function correlates with an
elevated expression of the CXC-chemokine CXCL8 in
in vitro models and its orthologous chemokine KC in
the prostate epithelium of PTEN+/− mice [5]. In addition
to the definition of several autocrine functions, CXCL8
has the potential to register profound effects on the tumor
microenvironment, predominantly through angiogenesis
or driving chemotactic migration of immune cells [24].
In this study, in vitro assays reaffirm that one impact of
tumor-derived CXCL8 from PTEN-deficient tumor cells
is to enhance chemotactic migration of macrophages.
Furthermore, we have shown that radiation-induced

exposure to radiation may affect the secretion of these
factors. Our data confirms that prostate epithelial cells and
macrophages are both a rich source of constitutive TNF-α
secretion in vitro. Profiling of micro-dissected tumor
epithelial tissue also confirms equivalent expression of
this inflammatory marker in both PTEN-expressing and
PTEN-deficient contexts. Experimental data indicated
that exposure to IR further induced TNF-α secretion from
THP-1 cells but had no effect on further potentiating
the endogenous levels of secreted TNF-α from
PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells. Extrapolating to the
treatment of patients, this would suggest that the altered
constitution of the microenvironment and especially, the
density of TAM infiltration in PTEN-deficient tumors
would be an important determinant in dictating the impact
of radiation in increasing the local concentration of
bioactive TNF-α present within tumor foci.
TNF-α is known to be an activator of either
apoptotic or pro-survival signaling [12]. Switching
between survival- and death-promoting signaling is
principally dependent on its ability to activate NFκB

transcription [27, 28]. Consistent with the resistance
of CaP cells to clinically relevant doses of TNF-α, this
cytokine was shown to increase NFκB signaling and
increase expression of c-FLIP, cIAP-1 and Bcl-2, three
known NFκB-regulated anti-apoptotic targets in prostate
cancer cells (30, 31). The activation of NFκB was
further increased following radiation and constitution of
macrophage-enriched tumor microenvironment, but was
inhibited by blockade of TNF-α signaling. Expression
of c-FLIP and cIAP-1 was further increased in irradiated
CaP cells in the presence of THP-1 cells, suggesting that
the inhibition of caspase-dependent apoptosis may be one
principal underlying mechanism of resistance afforded by
this cytokine.
The mode-of-action of cIAP-1 is well understood.
This protein is recruited to death receptors following
ligand binding and is responsible for resultant NFκB
activation by promoting the polyubiquitination of RIP-1
kinase (RIP1) [29]. Inhibition of cIAP-1 is therefore
viewed as an attractive and potential amenable target
to direct the downstream fate stemming from cytokine

signaling, switching from primarily a cell survival
response to a pro-apoptotic cell death phenotype. Several
Smac-mimetics, have demonstrated efficacy in a range
of cancer types [30, 31], including prior demonstration
that they can enhance radiotherapy sensitivity in CaP
xenograft models [32]. In our hands, treatment with a
novel IAP antagonist, AT-IAP, ablated the expression
of cIAP-1 in DU145 Sh11.02 cells, consistent with a
proteasome-dependent degradation of the protein. When
combined with exogenous TNF-α, AT-IAP reversed the
resistance of CaP cells to this cytokine, and significantly
reduced cell viability by promoting apoptosis in vitro.
Moreover, AT-IAP retained the capacity to augment
apoptosis levels in irradiated CaP cells in the coculture model, consistent with this agent working in
synergy with radiation-induced macrophage-derived
TNF-α. Moreover, in clonogenic survival assays, the
administration of AT-IAP reversed the resistance afforded
by macrophages, instead increasing the sensitivity of
PTEN-deficient Sh11.02 cells to clinically-relevant
doses of external-beam radiotherapy.
Macrophage-derived TNF-α signaling has
previously been implicated in promoting radio-resistance
in in vivo models of melanoma [7]. We have detected the
enrichment of macrophages in PTEN-deficient prostate
tumors, and extrapolating to use of co-culture models,
we have demonstrated the relevance of macrophages and
TNF-α signaling in contributing to the radio-resistance of
CaP cells. Moreover, our experimental data reveals that use
of an IAP antagonist confers increased radio-sensitivity of
PTEN-deficient cancer cells, exploiting the inflammatory
potential of the macrophage-enriched microenvironment.

unless otherwise stated.

Cell line and cell culture
Authenticated DU145 prostate cancer cells were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC);
PTEN expression was depleted and cells cultured as
previously described [5]. Human macrophage-like THP-1
cells were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented
with 10% FCS and 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol. In all
co-culture experiments, THP-1 cells were seeded at a
density which represented 20% of the prostate cancer cell
population. Cells were regularly tested to ensure they were
free of mycoplasma contamination.

DNA and RNA extraction from FFPE clinical
samples
Twenty-eight Gleason 7 grade prostate tumour FFPE
blocks were obtained from the Northern Ireland Biobank
(NIB13–0074). Sequential 4 μm sections of each case were
cut and placed on glass slides (a total of 20 μm). The tumour
regions were then macro-dissected into sterile 1.5 ml
Eppendorf tubes. The RNA was extracted using the Qiagen
RNAeasy kit according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Genomic DNA was extracted using the Promega Genomic
DNA extraction kit. All standard procedures were taken
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Extracted DNA
and RNA was quantified and assessed for their quality using
the Agilent Bioanalyser chips.

CONCLUSION
PTEN-deficient tumors exhibit an elevated
macrophage infiltration underpinning increased
macrophage-promoted TNF-α signaling that promotes
survival of CaP cells through up-regulation of
anti-apoptotic proteins including cIAP-1. Treatment
with a novel cIAP-1 antagonist, AT-IAP, sensitizes
malignant prostate cells to radiotherapy, suggesting that
Smac mimetics may be a relevant therapeutic strategy
for enhancing the effect of ionizing radiation in patients
presenting with PTEN-deficient CaP.

Whole genome gene expression (WG-DASL)
Whole genome gene expression analysis was
performed using the Illumina (San Diego, CA, USA)
WG-DASL assay according to manufacturer’s protocol.
Briefly, 100 ng of FFPE RNA was converted to cDNA by
the WG-DASL assay using biotinylated-tagged random
nonamer and oligo (dT) primers. The biontinylated
cDNA was then mounted onto a streptavidin-coated
support and further extended and ligated by gene-specific
oligonucleotides (DAP). Subsequently, PCR amplification
was performed. The resulting PCR products were eluted
and hybridized to the Illumina Human-Ref v3.0 Beadchip
and scanned with the Illumina iScan Reader. The image
intensity values from the microarray images generated
were then analysed by the GenomeStudio Gene Expression
Module (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) software. The
processed methylation values were subsequently used for
further analysis in this study.

Whole genome methylation

Western blotting analysis

Whole genome methylation analysis was performed
using the Illumina Infinium HD (San Diego, CA, USA)
assay according to manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly,
1000 ng of genomic DNA extracted from the FFPE
samples was firstly treated with sodium bisuphite to
convert unmethylated cytosine to uracil. The bisulphite
treated DNA was denatured isothermally and amplified
overnight. After amplification, the post-amplified DNA
was fragmented using a proprietary enzymatic process
and precipitated using isopropanol. The precipitated DNA
was then collected by centrifugation and re-suspended
in a hybridization buffer. The hybridized product was
then hybridized onto the Infinium 450K Beadchip. The
loaded chip underwent further extension and staining
steps. Subsequently, the Illumina iScan reader was used to
derive image intensity values off the stained chip from the
high-resolution scans of the chip. The image
intensity values was processed and normalized by the
GenomeStudio Gene Expression Module (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA). The processed methylation values were
subsequently used for further analysis in this study.

Whole cell lysates were prepared, resolved and
blotted as previously described [5]. Membranes were
probed with the following primary antibodies: anti-PTEN
(Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA); anti-c-FLIP (Enzo Life
Sciences, Exeter, UK); anti-cIAP-1 (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg,
Germany); anti-Bcl-2 (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA);
anti-TNFR-1 (Santa Cruz, Heidelberg, Germany); and
anti-Caspase-8 (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) at 4°C
overnight. Membranes were washed three times with 1X
PBS + 0.05% Tween-20 before being incubated with the
appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-tagged secondary
antibody (GE Healthcare, UK). Immunolabelled proteins
were detected using the Luminata Crescendo substrate
(Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Membranes were reprobed
with GAPDH primary antibody (ABD Serotec, UK) to
ensure equal loading.

Radiation treatments
Cells were exposed to 225 kVp x-rays using the
self-contained X-RAD 225 irradiation system (Precision
X-Ray Inc., Connecticut, USA). All experiments were
performed at a dose rate of 0.52 Gy min−1.

Immunohistochemistry

Chemotaxis assay

Tissue microarrays consisting of Gleason 6 (N =
15) and Gleason 7 (N = 55) prostate tumors were obtained
from the Northern Ireland Biobank. Consecutive TMA
paraffin sections of 4 μm thickness were cut and placed
onto silanated slides for immunohistochemical detection
of PTEN and CD68 using a Bond-Max autostainer
(Leica Biosystems, Newcastle, UK). Standard processing
steps were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, heat-induced antigen retrieval with
epitope retrieval ER1 solution (Leica Biosystems) was
performed for 20 min prior to incubation with primary
antibody. Slides were incubated with PTEN (Cascade
Bioscience, clone 6H2.1, dilution 1:400) or CD68
(BD Pharmingen, clone KP1, dilution 1:250). After
incubation, slides were washed with Bond washing
buffer (Leica Biosystems) and incubated with secondary
antibody (Bond Polymer Refine kit, Leica Biosystems).
Subsequently chromogenic detection was achieved
by incubation with 3, 30-diaminobenzidine (DAB)
followed by Bond DAB enhancer (Leica Biosystems).
All slides were counterstained with haematoxylin and
dehydrated through ascending ethanol to xylene before
mounting. Expression of PTEN was scored either as
positive (retention of cytoplasmic staining) or negative
(lack of staining). Expression of CD68 was scored based
on their staining pattern (either dense or sparse) of the
macrophages.

Analysis of THP-1 chemotaxis was performed using
the 5 µm pore size CytoSelect™ 96-Well Cell Migration
Assay kit (Cell Biolabs) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. For conditioned media experiments, prostate
cancer cells were treated with a 3 Gy dose of IR and
incubated at 37oC for 6 h prior to collecting media.

Clonogenic assays
Prostate cancer cells were plated into 6-well plates at
a final density determined by the dose of IR to be received.
At the same time, THP-1 cells were added directly to each
well intended for co-culture at a density that was 20%
of the total CaP cell number. Cells were left to incubate
at 37°C overnight before being treated accordingly the
following morning. For AT-IAP treatments, cells were
allowed to incubate for 1 h prior to being irradiated.
Following IR, plates were returned to the incubator for
10–14 days until colonies in the control plate had reached
a size of 50 cells or more. THP-1 cells were removed
by rinsing the wells with 1X PBS prior to fixation and
staining by 0.4% crystal violet. Surviving fractions (SF)
were calculated relative to non-irradiated cells and fitted
using a linear quadratic function (S = exp(-αD -βD2))
using least-squares regression (Prism 5.0; GraphPad
Software, CA). Area under-the-curve (AUC) representing

Detection of apoptosis
Cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105 into 6-well
plates and left to adhere overnight. Cells were then treated
with either rhTNF-α, AT-IAP or both and returned to the
incubator for 72 h. Whole culture medium was collected
and pooled with the corresponding trypsinized cells before
being pelleted via centrifugation at 1000 rpm. Cell pellets
were resuspended in 100 µl of binding buffer and 5 µl of
Annexin V antibody (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) was
added to each sample alongside 5 µl of propidium iodide
(PI) stain (50 µg/ml). Samples were incubated in darkness
for 15 min before adding 320 µl of binding buffer and
analyzing on the EPICS XL flow cytometer (Beckman
Coulter, Buckinghamshire, UK). Caspase 3/7 activity
assays were performed according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Promega, UK).
