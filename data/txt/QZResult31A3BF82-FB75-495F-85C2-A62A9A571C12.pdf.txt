Abstract
A splice isoform of the HER2 receptor that lacks exon 16 (d16HER2) is expressed in many HER2-positive breast
tumors, where it has been linked with resistance to the HER2-targeting antibody trastuzumab, but the impact of
d16HER2 on tumor pathobiology and therapeutic response remains uncertain. Here, we provide genetic evidence
in transgenic mice that expression of d16HER2 is sufﬁcient to accelerate mammary tumorigenesis and improve
the response to trastuzumab. A comparative analysis of effector signaling pathways activated by d16HER2 and
wild-type HER2 revealed that d16HER2 was optimally functional through a link to SRC activation (pSRC).
Clinically, HER2-positive breast cancers from patients who received trastuzumab exhibited a positive correlation
in d16HER2 and pSRC abundance, consistent with the mouse genetic results. Moreover, patients expressing high
pSRC or an activated "d16HER2 metagene" were found to derive the greatest beneﬁt from trastuzumab treatment.
Overall, our results establish the d16HER2 signaling axis as a signature for decreased risk of relapse after
trastuzumab treatment. Cancer Res; 74(21); 6248–59. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
HER2 is a 185-kDa transmembrane receptor that belongs to
the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including
HER1 (EGFR), HER3, and HER4. Binding of speciﬁc ligands to
the extracellular domain (ECD) of HER1, HER3, and HER4
induces the formation of homo- and heterodimers, with activated HER2 as a preferred partner (1). Overexpression or
ampliﬁcation of ERBB2 (HER2) occurs in 15% to 20% of invasive
breast cancers and is associated with more aggressive disease

and, until the advent of HER2-targeted agents, a worse outcome
(2). In the metastatic setting, the addition of HER2-targeted
agents to chemotherapy improved disease-free survival (37%),
overall survival (22%), and overall response rate (67%; ref. 3).
Trastuzumab, a recombinant humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody, combined with chemotherapy is a foundation of
care for patients with HER2-positive breast cancers (2, 3).
However, most HER2-positive breast cancer patients who initially respond to trastuzumab subsequently become refractory
and disease progresses. Several intrinsic mechanisms whereby
tumors escape HER2 inhibition by trastuzumab have been
suggested (4), including altered forms of HER2 itself (5, 6) and
activating HER2 mutations identiﬁed in HER2 gene ampliﬁcation–negative breast cancer (7). We and others (8, 9) reported
that the splice variant of human HER2 lacking exon 16, here
named d16HER2, and characterized by an imbalance in the
number of cysteines in the ECD portion and by the constitutive
generation of stable HER2 homodimers, is a highly penetrant
HER2 oncogenic alteration. d16HER2, identiﬁed in most human
HER2-positive primary breast cancers, effects a decrease in
trastuzumab binding in vitro (9) and promotes resistance to
trastuzumab in multiple cell lines (10).
Although transgenic (tg) mouse models of the rodent form of
HER2 (Neu) have been instrumental in the study of basic
oncogene activity (11–14), the inherent limitations of the rodent
Neu tg models have led to the development of tg mouse models
for the human wild-type, full-length HER2 (WTHER2; refs. 15–17)
to study the mechanisms regulating HER2-driven cancer recurrence, trastuzumab sensitivity, and resistance. However, both
rodent and human HER2 transgenes require activating mutations to become oncogenic, implying that genetic changes in

addition to HER2 overexpression are required for mammary
tumorigenesis (17, 18). In that context, we generated a FVB
mouse line that transgenically expresses the human d16HER2
isoform and stochastically develops metastatic multifocal mammary tumors expressing heterogeneous levels of constitutively
activated stable HER2 homodimers (pd16HER2D); these homodimers couple to multiple oncogenic downstream signal transduction pathways, including SRC kinase (19).
The oncogenic activity and trastuzumab susceptibility of
d16HER2-positive mammary tumors (9, 10, 20), as well as the
relationship of d16HER2 with WTHER2-driven pathobiologic
and clinical features in human HER2-overexpressing breast
cancers, await clariﬁcation.
Here, we provide evidence in both mice and humans that
d16HER2-positive tumors respond signiﬁcantly to trastuzumab and that this response depends on the functional relationship and coexpression of activated d16HER2 stable homodimers and SRC kinase.

Materials and Methods
Tumor cell lines
The d16HER2- and WTHER2-positive mammary tumor cell
lines MI6 and WTHER2 were established from spontaneous
primary mammary carcinomas of an 18-week-old virgin FVBd16HER2 and a 34-week-old virgin FVB-huHER2 tg female
mouse, respectively. Brieﬂy, primary mammary tumors excised
from sacriﬁced mice were ﬁnely minced, incubated in erythrocyte lysis buffer, enzymatically digested (Collagenase/Hyaluronidase; STEMCELL Technologies) and extensively washed
before examination in four high-power ﬁelds based on trypan
blue staining (see Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B for cell
membrane expression of d16HER2 and WTHER2, respectively).
In the case of d16HER2-positive tumors, whole mammary
tumor cell suspensions were selectively separated under sterile
conditions by AutoMACS separator (Miltenyi Biotec) to obtain
homogenous EPCAM- and d16HER2-positive neoplastic cell
cultures (manuscript in preparation). The MI6 and WTHER2
cell lines were maintained in complete culture medium (MammoCult; STEMCELL Technologies) supplemented with 1%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Sigma) and penicillin–streptomycin
(Sigma-Aldrich) and cultured at 37 C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere.
MI6 and WTHER2 tumor cell lines were routinely tested by
ﬂow cytometry and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR).
Tg mice and in vivo therapy
A breeding colony of FVB d16HER2 tg mice (FVB/NHsdTg(D16HER2-LUC)6157Acam) was generated as described
(19) and bred in the Animal Facility of Fondazione IRCCS
Istituto Nazionale dei Tumori. Animal care and experimental
procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee for Animal
Experimentation of the Institute according to the Italian law.
DNA extracted from tail biopsies was used for routine genotyping by PCR analysis (primers: F, 50 -GGCTCAGTGACCTGTTTTGG-30 and R, 50 -TGATGAGGATCCCAAAGACC-30 ),
with an expected amplicon length of 231 bp. Mice were inspected twice weekly by palpation.

huHER2 gene under the control of the MMTV promoter on
an FVB background (17) and was obtained from Genentech,
Inc. FVB-huHER2 mice were bred in animal facilities of the
DIMES Department of the University of Bologna and genetically screened by PCR using a primer set speciﬁc to human
growth hormone exons 4 and 5 included in the transgene
backbone (17). Mice were inspected weekly by palpation. In
vivo experiments were performed in compliance with the
Italian and European guidelines and were approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the University of Bologna. Progressively growing masses 50 mm3 were scored as tumors in
both tg models. Susceptibility of d16HER2 to trastuzumab
treatments was assessed in d16HER2-positive tg spontaneous
and in orthotopic d16HER2 and WTHER2-positive models. In
the ﬁrst set of in vivo experiments, d16HER2 tg mice were
injected i.p. with trastuzumab (Roche) or diluent NaCl solution
(0.9%) in a short (n ¼ 8/group) and prolonged (n ¼ 7–8/group)
administration protocol. In the short treatment, tg mice were
treated with trastuzumab (8 mg/kg) once per week for 5 weeks
starting from 8 weeks, when only microscopic tumor lesions
were present (19), until 12 weeks of age. The study was
terminated at 29 weeks of age, when all d16HER2 mice developed the ﬁrst spontaneous tumor. In the prolonged protocol,
d16HER2 tg mice received trastuzumab (4 mg/kg) twice weekly
from 8 until 42 weeks of age. In each experiment, tumors were
calibrated twice weekly and tumor volume was calculated as
0.5  d12  d2, where d1 and d2 are the smaller and larger
diameters, respectively. FVB female mice (6–8-weeks old; body
weight, 20–25 g) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice (n ¼ 10/group) were injected into the mammary
fat pad (m.f.p.) with 1  106 MI6 or WTHER2 tumor cells. When
tumors reached 50 mm3, mice were randomized into two
groups to receive biweekly i.p. injections of 4 mg/kg trastuzumab or diluent NaCl solution (0.9%). The use of the two
different dosing schedules of trastuzumab administration is
based on the reliable results we previously obtained (21, 22).
Tumors were calibrated twice weekly and tumor volume was
calculated as above. Mice were sacriﬁced when tumor volumes
reached 2,000 mm3. Each tumor specimen was placed into
liquid nitrogen for biochemical analyses. For histopathologic
analyses, tumors and lungs were ﬁxed overnight in 10% neutral-buffered formalin and transferred into 70% ethanol before
processing and parafﬁn embedding. Parafﬁn sections (5-mm
thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Lung
metastases were induced with 105 and 106 viable MI6 and
WTHER2 tumor cells, respectively, injected i.v. in 0.4 mL of PBS
in FVB female mice. Mice were randomized into two groups (n
¼ 8/group) to receive biweekly i.p. injections of 4 mg/kg
trastuzumab or diluent NaCl solution 0.9%, respectively. Treatment started 7 days after cell injection. Mice were sacriﬁced
and necropsied 11 weeks after d16HER2 and WTHER2 cell
injection. Lungs were perfused with black India ink to outline
metastases and ﬁxed in Fekete's solution. Lung metastases
were counted using a dissection microscope.

qRT-PCR to determine the amount of d16HER2 transcript, as
normalized to the amount of WTHER2 mRNA. Total RNA
from human primary breast cancer frozen specimens was
extracted with TRIzol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNAs were reverse-transcribed
from 1 mg of total RNA in a 20-mL volume with SuperScript
III (Invitrogen) using random-hexamer primers and examined by qRT-PCR using Applied Biosystems SYBR Green
dye–based PCR assay on the ABI Prism 7900HT sequence
detection system (Applied Biosystems). d16HER2 and
WTHER2 isoforms were ampliﬁed using 200 nmol/L primers
(10). Data were normalized to GAPDH (23). Relative abundance
of d16HER2 mRNA compared with that of WTHER2 was
calculated by the comparative Ct method (24), with d16HER2
transcript levels indicated as the ratio 2(DCt)d16HER2/
2(DCt)WTHER2. To correlate d16HER2 transcript and pSRC
expression levels in human breast cancers, gene expression
data were split in two groups according to tertiles: low, containing values under the ﬁrst tertile, and high, containing values
greater than the ﬁrst tertile.
Statistical analyses
Differences in tumor multiplicity curves in both d16HER2
and WTHER2 tg models and differences in trastuzumab antitumor activity in orthotopic MI6 and WTHER2 models were
calculated, by the two-tailed unpaired t test. Differences were
considered signiﬁcant at P < 0.05.
Linear regression and Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r were
calculated to estimate the correlation of (i) pd16HER2M and
pd16HER2D with pSRC and of pWTHER2 with pSRC levels
both under nonreducing and reducing conditions in protein
extracts from both d16HER2 and WTHER2 tg models; (ii)
d16HER2 with WTHER2 gene expression levels; and (iii) pSRC
(%) with d16HER2 transcript levels in human primary breast
cancers.
Survival was assessed using the Kaplan–Meier estimator,
whereas log-rank test was used to compare survival distributions. Survival analysis was carried out using Cox proportional
hazards regression models, and the effects of explanatory
variables on event hazard were quantiﬁed by hazard ratios
(HR; ref. 25).
Data for the "activated-d16HER2 metagene," constructed
based on the Illumina Whole-Genome DASL gene expression
proﬁling of 21 HER2-positive breast cancers characterized
for pSRC and d16HER2 expression (GSE55348, see Supplementary Table S4), were quantile-normalized using BeadStudio software and ﬁltered with a data matrix containing
22,121 probes, corresponding to 15,715 Entrez Ids. Pathways
differentially enriched in activated d16HER2 tumors were
evaluated by Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using GSEA
v2.0.13 (26) on a 193-cancer-related gene set (24). Permutation type was applied 1,000 times. Core members of each
signiﬁcantly (P < 0.05) enriched gene set were extracted and
their mean expression levels were considered as the "activated-d16HER2 metagene" value. The metagene was calculated in HER2-positive breast cancer biopsies of two publicly
available datasets, GSE22358 (27) and GSE41656 (28), for
which pathologic complete response information was avail-

able. Differences in "activated-d16HER2 metagene" values
between responders and nonresponders were evaluated by
the unpaired t test. Area under the ROC curve was calculated
by nonparametric ROC analysis (29).

Results
Pathobiologic characteristics of mouse lines
transgenically expressing human d16HER2 and WTHER2
We ﬁrst investigated the oncogenicity driven by d16HER2
and WTHER2 in tg models. Kaplan–Meier disease-free survival analysis (Fig. 1A) clearly revealed the signiﬁcant survival advantage (P < 0.001) of WTHER2 compared with the
d16HER2 variant. Indeed, mammary tumors in tg WTHER2
virgin females (n ¼ 40) arose after 8 months of age and
progressively thereafter only in 85% of mice, whereas all
d16HER2 tg virgin females (n ¼ 87) developed multiple
asynchronous mammary tumors between 8 and 32 weeks
of age. Tumor multiplicity (Fig. 1B) was also signiﬁcantly
higher in d16HER2 tg mice (P < 0.001), with a mean number
of ﬁve lesions at 30 weeks of age (n ¼ 45) versus a mean of
two in WTHER2 females at 60 weeks (n ¼ 39).
FISH analysis to evaluate the genetic status of HER2 in ex
vivo d16HER2 and WTHER2-positive tumor cells derived from
the spontaneous tg corresponding lesions (Fig. 1C) revealed a
single FISH signal on two chromosomes, both in metaphase
spreads and in interphase nuclei (arrows) from d16HER2positive tumor cells (left), whereas in WTHER2-positive cells
(right), ampliﬁed signals were identiﬁed within 2–3 chromosomes (arrows). Cytogenetic analysis revealed a near-tetraploid karyotype (76–88 chromosomes) of WTHER2-overexpressing cells compared with a diploid karyotype observed in
d16HER2-positive cells. Because our tg models are heterozygous for d16HER2 and WTHER2, these results suggest selective
duplication of the chromosome carrying the human transgene
in mammary tumor cells derived from tg mice.
Histopathologic analysis of tumors showed that both strains
develop mammary ductal adenocarcinomas; however, whereas all d16HER2 tumors (Fig. 1D) and the vast majority of
WTHER2 tumors (Fig. 1E) grew with a solid pattern, some
WTHER2 tumors showed papillary differentiation (data not
shown). Moreover, whereas WTHER2 tumors were composed
of uniform cells growing with a homogeneous solid appearance
(Fig. 1E), different zones were detected in d16HER2 tumors: an
outer zone composed of cells with an epithelial appearance and
pale cytoplasm ( ); an intermediate zone formed of fusiform
cells with darker nuclei ( ); and an inner zone of cells with an
epithelial appearance and pinkish cytoplasm ( ; Fig. 1D).
Immunohistochemical analysis classiﬁed both tumors in the
same intrinsic subtype, i.e., ERBB2-overexpressing (30), as they
are E-CADHERIN positive, conﬁrming their ductal type, and
express only low levels of estrogen receptor (ER), undetectable
levels of progesterone receptor (PR), high levels of the proliferation marker PCNA (>14%), and a positivity for HER2 on most
tumor cells (Fig. 1D and E). Interestingly, the intensity and
distribution of HER2 expression differed considerably in the two
strains. WTHER2 tumors showed strong and uniform membrane staining for HER2-tg protein on most tumor cells, with

Trastuzumab-mediated antitumor activity in d16HER2
and WTHER2 preclinical models
To address the critical controversy about trastuzumab
susceptibility, we performed a series of in vivo therapeutic
bioassays using trastuzumab in d16HER2 tg mice and in FVB
mice orthotopically transplanted with MI6 d16HER2-positive and WTHER2-positive tumor cell lines (Fig. 2). Trastuzumab treatment of tg mice for either a short (Fig. 2A and B)
or prolonged (Fig. 2C and D) time starting at 8 weeks of age,
when only microscopic tumor lesions are present (19), led in
both cases to a signiﬁcant reduction in mammary tumor
incidence (P ¼ 0.0038, short; P ¼ 0.0065, prolonged) and
tumor multiplicity ( , P ¼ 0.0004, short;  , P ¼ 0.0002,
prolonged) as compared with the control groups, suggesting

www.aacrjournals.org

a clear survival advantage upon trastuzumab treatment. In
the prolonged trastuzumab treatment, 1 out of 7 treated tg
mice was completely protected until the 42nd week of
observation (Fig. 2C). The validity of d16HER2- (MI6) and
WTHER2-positive cancer cells grown in the m.f.p. of parental
FVB females as appropriate therapeutic models, especially
useful for WTHER2-positive tumors that typically have a
long latency, was conﬁrmed by histologic examination and
HER2 staining of MI6 and WTHER2 orthotopic transplants
and their spontaneous tg primary tumor of origin; both the
d16HER2 and WTHER2 m.f.p. models (Fig. 2E, left) strictly
recapitulated histologic and immunohistochemical features
of spontaneous primary mammary tumors (Fig. 2E, right),
reproducing both the morphologic differentiation and differences in HER2 expression. Moreover, ﬂow cytometry to
assess expression levels of d16HER2 and WTHER2 forms in
the corresponding tumor cell lines showed a lower MFI of
d16HER2-positive cells than that of WTHER2-positive cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1), consistent with the HER2 staining
pattern (Fig. 1E).

We then tested the therapeutic activity of trastuzumab
in parental FVB females (n ¼ 10/group) orthotopically
implanted with MI6 (Fig. 2F) and WTHER2 (Fig. 2G) cells.
Trastuzumab treatment was started when mammary tumors
became palpable (50 mm3) and continued until tumor volume reached 2,000 mm3. As compared with controls (n ¼ 10/
group), trastuzumab effectively suppressed d16HER2-driven
tumor growth (P < 0.001; Fig. 2F), whereas the beneﬁts of
trastuzumab in mice with WTHER2 tumors were evident but
not statistically signiﬁcant (Fig. 2G). Assessment of the effect
of trastuzumab treatment on metastases apart from that on
the primary tumors using mice injected i.v. with 105 d16HER2
or 106 WTHER2 tumor cells showed that trastuzumab signiﬁcantly reduced the metastatic ability of MI6 (89% inhibition)
and, to a lesser extent, that of WTHER2 tumor cells

(75% inhibition; Table 1). Together, these results indicate that
trastuzumab can inhibit the oncogenic properties of d16HER2expressing mammary tumor cells.
Signal transduction axes downstream of d16HER2 and

Activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity of
d16HER2 was analyzed by Western blotting both under nonreducing and reducing conditions in eight primary tumor
protein extracts (Fig. 3A and B). The signaling activity downstream of WTHER2 was analyzed only under reducing conditions (n ¼ 9; Fig. 3E), as HER2 stable homodimers were never
detected in the WTHER2 model. Analysis consistently revealed

lanes 3, 6, 7, and 8). This scenario conﬁrms our previous
ﬁndings (19) and demonstrates that stable d16HER2D is
constitutively and heterogeneously activated in d16HER2-positive lesions. Analysis of cell signaling downstream of d16HER2
and WTHER2 receptors, evaluated under reducing conditions
(Fig. 3B and E), revealed that phosphotyrosines of pd16HER2M
and activated WTHER2 (pWTHER2) act as docking sites for
proteins, initiating signals that are transduced to the nucleus
through different circuitries, including the mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPK), AKT, SRC, and STAT3. However, the
activation levels of d16HER2 and WTHER2 signal transduction
pathways differed, with higher levels of pd16HER2D and
pd16HER2M always signiﬁcantly coupled to elevated pSRC
levels (Fig. 3A–D). This ﬁnding strongly suggests the existence
of a pd16HER2D–pSRC signaling axis that ampliﬁes d16HER2driven oncogenic signals, consistent with a signiﬁcant direct
correlation between pd16HER2D and pSRC (r ¼ 0.8787; P ¼
0.0041; Fig. 3C) and between pd16HER2M and pSRC (r ¼
0.8199; P ¼ 0.0127; Fig. 3D). Note that despite very high-level
expression of native SRC kinase only in WTHER2-positive
tumors in all samples, SRC was activated in only 6 out of 9
cases independent of pWTHER2 status (Fig. 3E), such that no
direct signiﬁcant correlation between pWTHER2 and pSRC
was apparent in the WT model (Fig. 3F).
To test whether the signal in the d16HER2 model is orchestrated mainly by downstream pSRC, we examined MI6 cells
treated or not at different times with anti-HER2 ECD MAbs
MGR2 and 4D5 and solubilized under nonreducing and reducing conditions; Western blotting showed that activation levels
of d16HER2D, d16HER2M, and SRC in treated cells decreased
in parallel in the same time frame compared with untreated
cells, whereas the phosphorylation status of MAPK and AKT
was kinetically less dependent on the downmodulation of
pd16HER2D, pd16HER2M, and pSRC levels (Fig. 3G and H).
Consistent with our biochemical analyses indicating a significant functional direct interaction only between d16HER2 and
pSRC (Fig. 3) and with in vitro data demonstrating a physical

www.aacrjournals.org

interaction between d16HER2 and pSRC (10), the tumor cell
membrane in both d16HER2-positive primary lesions and lung
metastases coexpressed d16HER2 and pSRC, as indicated by
IHC, immunoﬂuorescence, and confocal microscopy analyses
(Fig. 4).
Correlation of d16HER2 and SRC activity with
trastuzumab-mediated clinical efﬁcacy
To evaluate the potential association of d16HER2 and pSRC
in the human setting and to test whether patient outcome after
trastuzumab treatment might be inﬂuenced by d16HER2
signaling through pSRC activity, we examined a retrospective
series of 84 primary human HER2-positive cases treated adjuvantly with trastuzumab (see Supplementary Table S1 for
breast cancer patient pathobiologic and clinical characteristics). Evaluation of pSRC expression in formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded breast cancer sections by confocal microscopy (Fig.
5A and B) revealed high pSRC positivity (>20%) in 34 of 84
tumors (Fig. 5B), whereas the remaining 50 breast cancers
expressed pSRC levels ranging from 0% to <20% (Fig. 5A, left
and right, respectively). qRT-PCR analysis of 43 of the 84
available frozen breast cancer samples for d16HER2 transcript
levels, scored as low or high, revealed a signiﬁcant association
between pSRC (%) and d16HER2 (P ¼ 0.0482) expression (Fig.
5C). Moreover, tumors with pSRC (%) >0 showed a signiﬁcant
direct correlation between d16HER2 transcript and pSRC
expression (r ¼ 0.6880; P ¼ 0.0016; Fig. 5D), strongly suggesting
that the presence of active d16HER2D in primary HER2positive breast cancers is reﬂected by high SRC activation.
Finally, breast cancer patients with tumors expressing high
d16HER2 and pSRC levels exhibited a lower relapse rate after
trastuzumab treatment than did d16HER2-high/pSRC-low or
d16HER2-/pSRC-low patient subgroups (1/12 vs. 9/31). In light
of these results, we revisited the entire 84 case series, in which
34 showed high pSRC positivity (>20%); whereas no differences
in clinical-pathobiologic parameters were found between highand low-pSRC–expressing tumors (Supplementary Table S2),
the relapse-free survival of patients with a high pSRC score in
their primary tumors showed a signiﬁcantly lower progressive
disease rate after trastuzumab treatment than those with a
low pSRC score [HR, 0.28; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.09–
0.83; P ¼ 0.022; Fig. 5E), suggesting that high pSRC levels in
early tumors predicts beneﬁt from trastuzumab-containing
treatment.

Activated d16HER2/SRC Axis Predicts Trastuzumab Beneﬁt

To further investigate whether patients with high d16HER2
transcript/signaling are those more sensitive to trastuzumabmediated HER2 blocking, we generated an "activated-d16HER2
signature" by comparing the gene expression proﬁles of 21 of
the 43 qRT-PCR–tested breast cancer cases according to
d16HER2 and pSRC expression. Tumors expressing d16HER2
and pSRC-high were signiﬁcantly enriched in hypoxia, tumor
metastasis, and cell motility pathways in the GSEA analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, a metagene consisting of 73
leading genes (Supplementary Table S3) in the enrichment of
these pathways discriminated, with good performance, cases
with active d16HER2 ("activated-d16HER2 metagene"; AUC ¼
0.94; 95% CI, 0.83–1.04; P ¼ 0.0039; Fig. 6A). In silico analysis of
"activated-d16HER2 metagene" expression in two datasets,
GSE22358 (27) and GSE41656 (28), of HER2-positive breast
cancer patients treated or not with trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant therapy showed signiﬁcantly higher expression of this
metagene (P ¼ 0.0305) in patients who achieved a complete or
near-complete response to trastuzumab than in partial responders (Fig. 6B), with a good performance prediction (Fig. 6C). In
contrast, responders and nonresponders to neoadjuvant therapy consisting of chemotherapy alone revealed no difference in
the "activated-d16HER2 metagene" expression level (Fig. 6D),
strongly suggesting that human breast cancers with high

www.aacrjournals.org

d16HER2 signaling beneﬁt signiﬁcantly from the addition of
trastuzumab to chemotherapy treatment.

Discussion
In this study, we provide evidence that d16HER2 variant
constitutes a more aggressive HER2 isoform susceptible to
trastuzumab treatment. The signiﬁcantly shorter latency and
the consistently higher tumor multiplicity in the d16HER2 tg
line as compared with the WTHER2 tg line imply that genetic
changes in addition to WT gene ampliﬁcation are required for
mammary tumorigenesis. Moreover, cytogenetic and FISH
analyses of ex vivo d16HER2 tg tumor cells revealed a diploid
karyotype and a single signal in two chromosomes, whereas ex
vivo WTHER2 tg cancer cells showed a marked aneuploidy and
ampliﬁed signals on 2–3 chromosomes, supporting the notion
of a "ﬁrestorm" genomic pattern (31) needed to drive WTHER2associated mammary tumorigenesis.
About 90% of women with HER2-positive breast cancer and
locally disseminated disease have been reported to coexpress
the oncogenic d16HER2 isoform (9, 10). The coexistence of
d16HER2 with the other two naturally occurring HER2 splice
variants, herstatin and p100, with contrasting roles in tumor
cell biology (32), with truncated HER2 isoforms (33) and with

HER2 somatic mutations (7) greatly contributes in complicating the HER2-derived proteome and increasing the heterogeneity of HER2-positive disease. In this context, it is important
to note that if all the described HER2 forms are driver events,
then HER2-positive breast cancer patients might beneﬁt clinically from existing HER2-targeted drugs, although this seems
unlikely (34).
It has remained unclear whether d16HER2 is sensitive to
trastuzumab treatment (9, 10, 20, 35) and whether d16HER2
represents a mechanism of resistance to trastuzumab in
patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer (36, 37). In
keeping with a pilot study of immunodeﬁcient mice injected in
the mammary gland with a d16HER2-positive transfectant (20),
we found that spontaneous tumor development in d16HER2 tg
mice was signiﬁcantly impaired by trastuzumab administered
as monotherapy and that prolonged treatment was even
curative in one d16HER2-positive female observed until 42
weeks of age. Moreover, tumors formed after m.f.p. injections
of MI6 and WTHER2 cells showed marked beneﬁt of trastuzumab treatment only in d16HER2-positive tumors, whereas
WT tumors beneﬁted only moderately. Also, the antimetastatic
effects of trastuzumab on experimental lung metastases

6256

Cancer Res; 74(21) November 1, 2014

induced by MI6 and WTHER2-positive cells were more consistent in the d16HER2 model, indicating that only d16HER2driven tumor growth and aggressiveness remain highly dependent on oncogenic signaling pathways directed by and downstream of pd16HER2D. These in vivo data are consistent with
implications of an in vitro study reporting that trastuzumab is
preferentially active against tumors driven predominantly by
HER2 homodimer-induced signaling (38).
The d16HER2 variant, which seems to stabilize HER2 homodimer expression and activation, activates multisignaling cascades (10, 19, 20), including consistent phosphorylation of SRC
kinase (10, 19). SRC is the prototypic member of a non-RTK
family with broadly pleiotropic effects on mammalian cells,
including effects on cell morphology, adhesion, angiogenesis,
migration, invasiveness, proliferation, differentiation, and survival (39). Aberrant expression and activation of SRC occurs in
several tumor types and has been correlated with poor outcome; SRC is also a potent mediator of many downstream
effects of both HER1 and HER2 (39). In addition, SRC is a
reportedly common node downstream of multiple resistance
pathways and a driver of trastuzumab resistance, as it is
hyperactivated in various trastuzumab-resistance cell models

(40). While Mitra and colleagues (10) speculated that in
d16HER2-positive transfectants, SRC kinase might act as a
"master regulator" of the spliced isoform, stabilizing its expression and coupling to mitogenic and cell motility pathways and
contributing to trastuzumab resistance, we found that high
levels of pd16HER2D and M, and not pWTHER2, were directly
linked to marked SRC activity and that in vivo d16HER2-driven
tumorigenicity was signiﬁcantly halted by trastuzumab treatment. We also found a consistent decrease in SRC activity upon
knockdown of activated d16HER2D and M with the anti-HER2
MAb MGR2 and with MAb 4D5, the murine precursor of
trastuzumab, strongly suggesting that the pd16HER2D–pSRC
signaling axis is particularly sensitive to trastuzumab administration. Additional evidence for a functional cross-talk
between pd16HER2D and pSRC came from both IHC and
confocal microscopy analyses, indicating that such molecules
are coexpressed at high levels at the cell surface by the same
tumor cells in either primary mammary lesions or lung metastases of the d16HER2 tg line. Overall, our preclinical ﬁndings
suggest that intense coexpression of the d16HER2 variant and
pSRC at the tumor cell membrane reﬂects pd16HER2D-driven
signaling.
In light of our previous speculation that the proportion and
relevance of d16HER2 in HER2-positive breast cancers might
redeﬁne its role in sensitivity/resistance to trastuzumab and
can have an impact on current therapeutic strategies (32), we
sought clinical veriﬁcation of our preclinical data by examining
tissue from 84 HER2-positive breast cancers treated with
adjuvant trastuzumab (41). In 43 out of 84 breast cancer
specimens for which frozen samples were available for
d16HER2 qRT-PCR analysis, 12 out of 13 high-pSRC–expressing

www.aacrjournals.org

primary tumors expressed elevated levels of d16HER2 transcript, strongly suggesting that pSRC reﬂects activated
d16HER2 homodimers in human HER2-positive breast cancers. Indeed, such tumors are enriched in "tumor metastasis,"
"hypoxia," and "cell motility" pathways, all features of aggressiveness revealed in the d16HER2 tg model. Thus, the better
prognosis observed in the trastuzumab-treated HER2-positive
breast cancer patients with elevated pSRC could be a direct
consequence of the expression on their tumors of an activated
d16HER2–SRC signaling axis, as observed in the trastuzumabsensitive d16HER2-driven mouse model. Indeed, in silico analyses to better deﬁne the high-pd16HER2/pSRC tumor proﬁle
indicated an "activated-d16HER2 metagene" that was
expressed at signiﬁcantly higher levels in tumors completely
responsive to neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy as compared with those only partially responsive, whereas "activatedd16HER2 metagene" expression levels did not differ between
complete and partial responders to neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone.
Our ﬁndings seem to contrast directly with those of Zhang
and colleagues (40), who reported a lower clinical response rate
and a higher progressive disease rate after trastuzumab treatment in HER2-positive breast cancer patients with high pSRC
expression; however, it should be noted that their series
consisted of 57 breast cancer patients who received ﬁrst-line
trastuzumab-based therapy in a metastatic setting, whereas
our series includes breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab-based regimens in an adjuvant setting (41). We
speculate that although HER2-positive primary breast cancers
expressing high levels of pSRC are initially dependent on HER2
and all its potential driver isoforms and are, thus, responsive to

trastuzumab, the progression of such breast cancers due to a
high HER2-dependent growth rate might lead to accumulation
of genetic alterations that result in less HER2 dependency and,
in turn, signiﬁcantly less or even no responsiveness to
trastuzumab.
Such a hypothesis would reconcile the contrasting ﬁndings
of Zhang and colleagues (40) with our own, as HER2 signaling–
dependent tumors beneﬁtting from trastuzumab at an early
stage may just be those that, if not treated early, gain additional
dependencies in a metastatic setting to allow escape from
trastuzumab therapeutic effects. Together, our ﬁndings indicate the need for further evaluation of the role of pSRC in
primary and advanced HER2-positive disease before clinical
decision making. While the relatively small size of our HER2
patient samples precluded analysis of whether breast cancer
patients with high d16HER2/low pSRC levels might express
inactive d16HER2 homodimers due to a failure to couple with
pSRC, and despite a lack of a speciﬁc anti-pd16HER2D reagent,
our present preclinical, clinical, and in silico data support the
notion that activated HER2 signaling is indicative of beneﬁts
from the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy and that
d16HER2 expression is not a reliable indicator of trastuzumab
resistance but instead a mirror of pSRC activity, reﬂecting
d16HER2 homodimer-mediated driver activity leading to high
responsiveness to trastuzumab. These data might shed light on
the very complex "HER2 world" and help clinicians identifying
the "real" HER2 drivers for targeting by appropriate pharmacologic strategies.
