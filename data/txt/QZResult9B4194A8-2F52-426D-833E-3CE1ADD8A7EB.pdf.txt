ABSTRACT:
Personalized therapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has
been improved by the introduction of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs),
gefitinib and erlotinib. EGFR TKIs induce dramatic objective responses and increase
survival in patients bearing sensitizing mutations in the EGFR intracytoplasmic
tyrosine kinase domain. However, virtually all patients develop resistance, and this
is responsible for disease relapse. Hence several efforts are being undertaken to
understand the mechanisms of resistance in order to develop combination treatments
capable to sensitize resistant cells to EGFR TKIs. Recent studies have suggested
that upregulation of another member of the EGFR receptor family, namely ErbB3 is
involved in drug resistance, through increased phosphorylation of its intracytoplasmic
domain and activation of PI3K/AKT signaling. In this paper we first show, by using
a set of malignant pleural effusion derived cell cultures (MPEDCC) from patients
with lung adenocarcinoma, that surface ErbB3 expression correlates with increased
AKT phosphorylation. Antibodies against ErbB3, namely A3, which we previously
demonstrated to induce receptor internalization and degradation, inhibit growth and
induce apoptosis only in cells overexpressing surface ErbB3. Furthermore, combination
of anti-ErbB3 antibodies with EGFR TKIs synergistically affect cell proliferation in
vitro, cause cell cycle arrest, up-regulate p21 expression and inhibit tumor growth
in mouse xenografts. Importantly, potentiation of gefitinib by anti-ErbB3 antibodies
occurs both in de novo and in ab initio resistant cells. Anti-ErbB3 mAbs strongly
synergize also with the dual EGFR and HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. Our results suggest
that combination treatment with EGFR TKI and antibodies against ErbB3 should be a
promising approach to pursue in the clinic.

for a long period of time [3]; a significant proportion of
patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage when surgery
is no longer an option and often when metastases have
already diffused to other organs. The most common type
of lung cancer is non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
which accounts for approximately 80-85% of all cases [4].
In the last ten years the introduction of targeted therapies
has positively impacted upon the prognosis of a subsets
of NSCLC patients carrying either mutations in EGFR,
EML-ALK translocations or KRAS mutations, for which
specific inhibitors of the relevant kinases have been
developed [5,6].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is
a transmembrane protein with an extracellular ligand
binding domain and an intracellular domain possessing
intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. EGFR belongs to a
family of four transmembrane receptors (ErbB2/HER2,
ErbB3/HER3 and ErbB4), commonly called also ErbBs
which, upon ligand-driven homo or heterodimerization
and subsequent activation of their receptor-associated
tyrosine kinase domains, stimulate downstream signaling
cascades leading to cell proliferation, motility and survival
[7,8]. ErbBs have been linked for the past twenty years
to the process of tumorigenesis and therefore the object
of intense studies directed to the development of their
inhibitors as cancer therapeutics. Indeed EGFR was found
to be overexpressed in several types of tumors including
lung carcinomas [9]. In particular in different series of
NSCLCs overexpression of EGFR ranging from 45 to
90% was reported [10,11]. Since inhibition of EGFR by
specific blocking agents causes growth inhibition in in
vitro and in vivo tumor models, this justified the initial
development of TKI inhibitors gefitinib and eroltinib
[5,12]. However it was soon discovered that neither the
expression level nor constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR
predict clinical responses to TKI inhibitors [13]. Instead
compelling evidence was provided showing that only
the presence of mutations within EGFR can distinguish
responders from non-responders. It is now well established

that specific genetic alterations in exons 18, 19 and 21 of
the EGFR gene, which are found in approximately 1015% of patients diagnosed with NSCLC, are predictive
of response to TKIs. This implies the necessity to use
these compounds in strictly personalized approaches to
the therapy of lung cancer. Several Phase III clinical trials
have shown statistically significant superiority to standard
chemotherapy in terms of response rate, progressionfree survival and quality of life in patients with NSCLC
across all therapy lines. In light of these studies TKIs like
gefitinib can now be considered as the standard first-line
treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC harboring
activating EGFR mutations [5,14-19].
In spite of these positive aspects, the impact
of EGFR TKIs on overall survival remains marginal
in patients with advanced disease. This is generally
believed to be due to the rapid development of drug
resistance. Several are the mechanisms identified to be
responsible of resistance [20], the most frequent being
the occurrence of a secondary so called “gatekeeper”
mutation T790M in EGFR which accounts for about
50% of cases [21-23]. Likewise, amplification of cMet
was described to occur in cells resistant to TKI treatment
and cMet transphosphorylation of ErbB3 was shown to
be a mechanism whereby resistant cells can circumvent
blockade of EGFR activity [24-25]. Moreover, suboptimal
pathway inhibition by tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
was shown to result in a compensatory shift in ErbB3
activation [26]. In all these cases the central involvement
of ErbB3 in the development of resistance has been
suggested.
ErbB3 has been disregarded for several years as
a cancer target, although the elevated expression of this
receptor in several human cancers led in early times to
postulate its involvement in tumor progression [27-29].
This low interest in ErbB3 was also due to the lack of
detectable mutations in cancer samples and the absence of
a strongly active tyrosine kinase in its intracellular domain
[30]. However, during the past 5 years a mounting number
1254

of evidences have been accumulated pointing to a key role
of this receptor in tumorigenesis and cancer progression
and, above all in the establishment of resistance to
therapies [26, 30]. These evidences have triggered major
efforts towards the development of anti-ErbB3 therapies.
Because this receptor is devoid of strong intrinsic kinase
activity, the major strategy in this case is the generation of
monoclonal antibodies directed against the receptor. Some
of these have already entered clinical development [31].
Our group has recently generated a set of anti-ErbB3
monoclonal antibodies. We have previously shown that
two antibodies, named A3 and A4, displaying low nM
affinity for the receptor, are able to block ligand induced
receptor phosphorylation and downstream AKT signaling
in a variety of cancer cells and to efficiently inhibit tumor
growth in xenograft models [32].
In this paper we demonstrate the ability of antiErbB3 antibodies to sensitize cells resistant to EGFR

TKIs to these drugs both in an established lung cancer
cell line and in primary cultures from malignant pleural
effusions of lung adenocarcinoma patients, and that this
effect correlates with the expression levels of ErbB3.
Furthermore we started to address the mechanism
responsible for synergism.

surface ErbB3 expression. We have previously described
an efficient procedure to establish in vitro primary cell
cultures from Malignant Pleural Effusions of patients
affected by adenocarcinoma of the lung [33]. Using this
protocol a collection of MPEDCC (Malignant Pleural
Effusion Derived Cell Cultures) suitable to investigate
lung cancer heterogeneity and response to therapies was
obtained. We decided to analyze the expression of ErbB3
in a representative set of samples. We first measured
surface expression of ErbB3 by cytofluorimetry (Figure
1a, Table 1). To this purpose we utilized 7 MPEDCC and
as control a stable lung Adeno Ca cell lines, PC9 which
is highly sensitive to gefitinib (IC50 0,015 µM) for the
presence of exon 19 deletion, and its gefitinib resistance
subclone PC9ZD, which harbors the gatekeeper T790M
(Table 1, Supplementary 1) [34,35]. Results showed
great heterogeneity in the expression level of ErbB3 on
cell surface, which allowed us to assign samples to three
groups having high (>50%), intermediate (>10 <50%) and
low (<10% ) ErbB3 levels respectively.
WB analysis (Figure 1b) confirmed high variability

in the expression of total ErbB3, which however was not
always corresponding to the surface expression of the
receptor, thus suggesting that not in all cases the receptor
is efficiently exposed to the cell surface and therefore
likely functional. Interestingly however, we found that
high surface expression of ErbB3 correlated both in
primary cells and in the PC9/PC9ZD cell lines to elevated
pAKT levels (Spearman’s correlation coefficient=0.88,
p=0.003), suggesting that activation of the PI3K/AKT
survival pathway is strictly associated to surface ErbB3
expression and activation by its ligand (Figure 1c). In
addition, the heterogeneity of the primary tumor cell lines
was also reflected in the variability of activated MAPK
pathway.

Anti-ErbB3 monoclonal antibodies affect HRG
signaling and induce apoptosis in MPEDCC lung
adenocarcinoma cultures
The high expression of ErbB3 on the surface of
a subset of lung adenocarcinoma cell cultures led us to
explore the effect of anti-ErbB3 monoclonals directed
against the extracellular domain of the receptor. We
previously reported the generation of two anti-human
ErbB3 monoclonals, A3 and A4, which bind the receptor
with nM affinity and are able to efficiently compete for
ligand binding and to inhibit AKT signaling [32]. These
two monoclonals recognize different epitopes, both
of them strongly inducing receptor internalization and
degradation [36].
In order to verify whether one of these monoclonals,
named A3, was able to inhibit ErbB3 signaling in
MPEDCCs, we evaluated both ErbB3 downmodulation
and signaling inhibition by WB analysis in PC9, PC9ZD
and Pe e/10 as a representative MPEDCC with high ErbB3
surface expression. To confirm an active ErbB3 signaling
and if this was due to an autocrine ligand-receptor loop,
we also analyzed heregulin (HRG) expression by western
blotting (Figure 2a). A3 was able induce downmodulation
of the receptor in a time dependent manner (Figure
2b), with a noticeable effect in the Pe e/10 cell culture.
Moreover, we observed that treatment for 24 hr with A3
inhibited HRG-induced phosphorylation of both ErbB3,
AKT and, to a minor extent also of pERK 1/2 (Figure 3).

thus indicating that the effect was specific only for cells
expressing high surface levels of the receptor and with
concomitant high basal level pAKT as previously shown
(Figure 4a, Supplementary 2, and Figure 1). In order to
provide further insights into the biological effect of A3
we evaluated apoptosis induction by flow cytometry
in the cell cultures in which A3 inhibited the signaling.
Consistently, in the cell cultures analyzed we observed
an increased percentage of cells that underwent apoptosis
after 72 hours of treatment, while the cell line with low
ErbB3 expression did not, as confirmed by Annexin V
staining (Figure 4b and Supplementary 3).

mutations, we determined that exon 19 deletion was
present in a significant proportion of the cell lines.
Interestingly, when our collection of MPEDCC was tested
for sensitivity to gefitinib, we observed that the majority of
them were resistant (Table 1). Plasma trough concentration
of the drug achieved during therapy is approximately 1
mM, therefore this is generally considered the resistance
threshold [36]. However, we found that only two out of
six cell lines contained the T790M mutations. We thus
wondered whether A3 could potentiate the effect of
gefitinib in lung cancer cells with spontaneous or acquired
resistance to this TKI.
To assess the effect of anti-ErbB3 monoclonals as
sensitizers to gefitinib, we focused on MPEDCC Pe e/10,
which has high expression of ErbB3/ high resistance to the
drug (IC50=9,3 µM) and PC9ZD resistant cell line which
contains the Del exon and harbors the T790M mutation
(IC50 = 14,4 µM Supplementary Figure 2). In clonogenic
assays we observed an increased growth inhibition in cell

cultures treated for 10 days with A3 in combination with
gefitinib, as compared to treatment with gefitinib alone,
both in PC9ZD line and in e/10 (Figure 5a, Supplementary
Figure 4, Table 2). Similar results were obtained upon cotreatment of cells with the other approved EGFR TKI
erlotinib (Supplementary Figure 5) and with the dual
EGFR/Her2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib (Figure 5b).
This potentiating effect was confirmed by the
assessment of apoptosis in resistant PC9ZD and Pe e/10
cell cultures. Apoptosis induction was higher in cells
treated with the combination of A3 and Gefitinib, with
respect to single treatments (Figure 5c).
Moreover, in resistant PC9ZD we observed that
HRG-induced proliferation as measured by Ki67 staining
was dramatically impaired by the combination A3 plus
gefitinib (Figure 6a).
When we investigated the expression of the
principal cell cycle regulators, we saw an increased
upregulation at the protein level of p21 in A3 treated cells,
while the only gefitinib was not able to elicit this effect
both in PC9ZD and Pe e/10. This result was more evident
in cells treated with the combination, indicating a possible
role of A3 monoclonals to induce p21 and consequently
determine an arrest in the cell proliferation (Figure 6b and

Supplementary Figure 6a). The p21 induction, moreover,
was independent of p53 upregulation as observed by
western blot and was regulated in a post-transcriptional
manner (Supplementary Figure 6b). Moreover, cell cycle
analysis showed an arrest of cells in G2/M checkpoint
when cells were treated with both gefitinib and A3 (Figure
6b).
Interestingly, analyzing the signaling pathways, the
combination resulted in a greater inhibition of ERK HRGinduced phosphorylation, thus confirming that A3 together
with gefitinib are able to cooperate in repressing the AKT
and ERK pathway (Figure 6c).

Anti-ErbB3 antibodies potentiate the effect of
gefitinib in vivo
To determine if A3 antibody, blocking ErbB3
receptor activity, is able to potentiate in vivo the effect
of Gefitinib on resistant tumor, xenograft tumors from Pe
e/10 primary culture were established in immunodeficient
mice. Pe e/10 primary culture carries wild type EGFR
receptor and is highly resistant to Gefitinib treatment
(Table 2). Moreover Pe e/10 cells express high levels
of ErbB3 receptor which is also exposed on the cell
membrane of most of the cells (Figure 1, Table 1).
Secondary xenografts were established by serially
passaging xenograft obtained by s.c. injections in NOD/
SCID mice. Once tumor reached 100 mm3, mice were
randomized and allocated in the following experimental
groups: vehicle treated, gefitinib treated (100 mg/10ml/
kg, p.o., daily, 5 days/week), A3 treated (20 mg/10 ml/
Kg, i.p., once per week), and combination of gefitinib
and A3. Tumor growth was initially followed by caliper,
but we found some inconsistent values during the course
of the experiment due to the preference of this tumor
to grow toward the peritoneum instead of expanding
subcutaneously. Treatments were continued for four
weeks and mice were then sacrificed to determine if an
effect was appreciable on tumor masses. After harvesting,
tumor weight was determined and we found that cotreatment had a greater impact on tumor growth. Gefitinib
or A3 monotherapy treatment, reduced tumor masses of
about 60%. However, these results were not statistically
significant in comparison with vehicle treatment alone.
The combination of A3 and Gefitinib was more efficacious
in reducing tumor mass (70% inhibition vs vehicle treated
group, p< 0.05) as compared to monotherapies (Figure
7a). To determine the consequence of treatments on
ErbB3 pathway, total cell extracts from tumor samples
were analyzed by western blot. The results are shown in
Figure 7b and indicate a strong impairment of pAKT and
pERK signaling when A3 and gefitinib were administered
in combination. These data therefore suggest that in
vivo double inhibition of ErbB3 and EGFR can achieve
stronger antitumoral effects.

In this context it is important to identify factors that
contribute to EGFR-induced tumor cell growth because
their targeting may help sensitizing cells to the activity
of TKIs.
De novo resistance to TKIs has been the subject
of intense studies over the past years. These have led to
the identification of multiple mechanisms, among them
the most frequent ones are either the occurrence of the
secondary gatekeeper mutation T790M mutation in the
EGFR intracytoplasmic domain or cMET amplification.
These findings have fostered new approaches directed
to the development of second generation irreversible
EGFR inhibitors [19,39], or also to the clinical
development of cMET inhibitors [40]. In virtually all
de novo resistant NSCLC tumors the ErbB3 receptor is
strongly phosphorylated [23,25,41]. ErbB3 does not have
an intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity; however it can be
very efficiently phosphorylated in trans by cMET or by
other RTKs such as for example ErbB2 or ErbB4 [42].
ErbB3 strongly cooperates with the other members of
the ErbB family in the activation of intracellular pro-

DISCUSSION
Therapy of NSCLC with first generation small
molecule EGFR kinase inhibitors, gefitinib and erlotinib,
is severely limited by two main factors: first, the poor
sensitivity to TKIs of tumor cells expressing wild type
forms of the receptor [14-19]; second the emergence of
drug resistance in virtually all tumors bearing EGFR
mutations initially sensitive for the presence of either

survival signaling due to the presence of several tyrosine
residues in its intracytoplasmic domain which, upon
phosphorylation, become high affinity docking sites for
the catalytic subunit of PI3K. Based on these evidences
ErbB3 may represent a key node to co-target in order to
potentiate the activity of EGFR TKIs. The cooperation
between EGFR and ErbB3 may be playing an important
role not only in cells which acquire de novo resistance to
gefitinib and erlotinib but also in primary resistant cells
bearing only wild-type EGFR. In this paper we have
investigated this aspect with the use of two distinct tools,
namely MPE-derived primary cultures of NSCLC and

anti-ErbB3 antibodies recently generated in our laboratory.
MPE-derived tumor cells propagate in culture at
high efficiency and represent cells with high propensity
to metastasize. Using seven independent cultures it was
possible to group them in high ErbB3 surface expressors
(>70%), intermediate ErbB3 surface expressors (>20%
< 70%) and low ErbB3 surface expressors (<20%).
Interestingly, both high and intermediate surface ErbB3
expression corresponded to elevated levels of pAKT,
which suggests that surface expression of ErbB3 above
a certain threshold may help promoting NSCLC survival
independently of the presence of a wild-type or of a

mutated form of EGFR (see Table 1). Our collection
of primary MPE-derived cultures present an elevated
frequency of mutations in EGFR (3 out of 7) which
is much higher than the reported frequency of EGFR
mutation in NSCLC. In two out of four cases (g/11 and
s/11) histological sections of the primary tumors were
available, which allowed to carry out EGFR sequencing.
Surprisingly, in these two cases no Exon 19 deletion was
detected in contrast with the cell cultures data (data not
shown). At the moment we are unable to explain this
discrepancy. One possibility is that a small proportion
of EGFR mutated cells is already present in the primary
tumor, below the detection limit of the sequencing analysis
and these cells are selected in vivo because of their
increased fitness to metastasize in the pleura, and/or also
in vitro by the cell culture conditions used.
ErbB3-driven phosphorylation of AKT may
contribute to low sensitivity to TKIs. In order to address
this aspect we focused our attention on one of the high
surface expressing cells, Pe e/10 and as controls on two
stable NSCLC cell lines, the gefitinib sensitive PC9 and its
resistant counterpart PC9ZD bearing the T790M mutation
[34,35]. Interestingly, both PC9ZD and Pe e/10 which are
resistant to gefitinib express higher levels of the ligand
heregulin than PC9. We first observed in these cells that
the anti-ErbB3 antibody A3 was able to induce strong
ErbB3 downregulation as previously shown in melanoma

cells and that the antibody was able to decrease, albeit
to a variable extent, heregulin-induced pErbB3, pAKT
and pERK signaling [36]. The same antibody was able
to affect cell proliferation and to induce apoptosis, when
used at doses above 10 µg/ml. Importantly antibody
efficacy correlated with surface ErbB3 expression because
the same antibody was unable to affect cell growth and
apoptosis of one of the low surface ErBB3 expressing cell
lines Pe o/11.
When we went to analyze the potential synergy of
the anti-ErbB3 antibody A3 with gefitinib both in acquired
(PC9ZD) and EGFR wild-type (Pe e/10) resistant cells,
we observed an approximate 20-10 fold sensitization of
cells to the TKI and a significant shift to the left of the
dose-response curve. The ability of A3 to potentiate the
effect of gefitinib in EGFR mutated cells (PC9ZD) was
confirmed in a variety of assays including short term cell
proliferation (Ki67), apoptosis and cell cycle. This latter
analysis showed that combinatorial treatment of PC9ZD
cells with A3 and gefitinib resulted mainly in G2/M arrest,
in line with the strong induction of p21. Interestingly,
A3 treatment caused a pronounced induction of p21
in the absence of increased p53 levels, which was even
further potentiated by co-treatment with gefitinib. It will
be interesting to further analyze the mechanism of p21
induction by anti-ErbB3 antibodies in NSCLC and if this
is due to activation of an intracellular pathway leading to

Figure 7: A3 increases the efficacy of gefitinib in vivo. NOD/SCID mice xenografted with Pe e/10 primary cultures were treated

with either gefitinib (100 mg/Kg) or A3 (20 mg/Kg) alone or with the combination of both. After 4 weeks mice were sacrificed and tumors
weight were determined. *p<0.05 versus vehicle.

increased p21 stabilization. It is also important to point
out that potentiation of TKI activity was not only observed
with gefitinib but also with the other first generation
EGFR TKI erlotinib and, more intriguingly with lapatinib.
This last observation suggests that also in the presence of
simultaneous inhibition of both EGFR and HER2 kinases,
ErbB3 is still able to signal and to promote cell growth
and survival, probably via trans-phosphorylation by
other kinases and that the only approach to fully abolish
its activity is through the use of monoclonal antibodies
capable to induce its internalization and degradation.
Hence this finding further underscores the necessity to cotarget this receptor in order to obtain maximal therapeutic
efficacy of TKI inhibitors in lung cancer.
Finally, potentiation of gefitinib by the anti-ErbB3
antibody A3 was confirmed in an in vivo xenograft model
with Pe e/10. These cells, when implanted subcutaneously,
show a high propensity to invasive growth in the
underlying tissues. Necropsy analysis of mice implanted
with Pe e/10 showed significant tumor growth inhibition
only upon co-treatment, which also resulted in increased
inhibition both in AKT and ERK phosphorylation.
In conclusion, antibodies against ErbB3 may
become new tools in our repertoire of anticancer agents for
the therapy of NSCLC because of their ability to potentiate
the effect of EGFR inhibitors. It is important to underline
that use of these agents requires a rational approach
based on the evidences presented in this paper. First,
anti-ErbB3 antibodies will be effective only in the subset
of NSCLC which express surface levels of the receptor
above a certain threshold which we have also shown to
correspond to increased AKT pathway activation levels.
Hence surface ErbB3 may be considered a predictive
marker of efficacy if appropriately validated in a higher
number of cases. Furthermore, also in these cases ErbB3
should not be considered the main driver of tumor growth
but rather a co-promoting factor. For this reason, antiErbB3 antibodies may not result to be highly efficacious
by themselves as single agents, but rather to act as
potentiators of small inhibitors of EGFR or of other RTKs.
In light of these considerations, extreme care should be
played in the clinical development of anti-ErbB3 agents
in order to fully exploit their potential.

anti-ErbB3, anti-p21, anti-p27 and anti-p53 were obtained
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti GAPDH and Actin
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Anti HRG was

Cell lines and primary cell cultures
PC9 and PC9ZD lung cancer cell lines were a kind
gift of Dr Nishio Kazuto. PC9 and PC9ZD were cultured
in RPMI-1640 (Gibco) supplemented with 10% Fetal
Bovine Serum (Gibco), penicillin and streptomycin 100 U/
ml and 100 µg/ml respectively (Biowest), in a humidified
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C. Primary cell cultures
were obtained from malignant pleural effusions of patients
affected by NSCLC. Protocol of MPE-derived cell cultures
isolation was described by Mancini et al, 2011. All cell
cultures experiments were approved by the Sant’Andrea
Hospital Ethics Committee 2010 (504/10). All samples
were obtained upon informed consent of patients.

Cell proliferation and clonogenic assays
Cell proliferation were quantified using MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide). Depending on the cell cultures, a variable
number of 1000-5000 cells/well were plated in 96 well
plates in RPMI 10% FBS with various concentrations of
gefitinib. After 96 hrs MTT was added for 4 hrs at 37°C at
each well. Formazan crystals formed were dissolved with
DMSO. Optical density was measured at 570 and 690 nm
with ELISA reader (Thermo Scientific). Experiments were
performed in triplicates, the IC50 values were obtained
using Kaleidagraph software.
For clonogenic assays single cell suspensions were
plated at 2000-5000 cells/well in 24 well/plates, in the
presence or absence of various concentration of gefitinib,
erlotinib or lapatinib and/or A3 at 25 µg/ml. After 10-15
days colonies were visualized with crystal violet in 20%
methanol. Colonies were counted manually, dissolved in
methanol and read at the OD595 nm.

DNA extraction and mutational analysis

with 5 µl of Annexin V-FITC (Invitrogen) and PI at 5 µg/
ml (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes at room temperature in
the dark. Apoptosis were determined using MACSquant
cytofluorometer. Both early (Annexin V-positive, PI
negative) and late (Annexin V-positive, PI positive)
apoptotic cells were included in cell death determination.

Genomic DNA from cancer cell lines was isolated
using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen) and
analysed by 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis to evaluate
the DNA quality. The DNA quantity was assessed by using
the Nanovue (GE Healthcare) and the purity was evaluated
by calculating the 260/280 ratio. Mutations in exon 19,
20 and 21 were assessed by direct sequencing of the PCR
product. Methods and primers are available on request.

Cell cycle Analysis
Cell cycle analysis was performed in cells treated
or not with A3 at 50 µg/ml and or gefitinib at 1 µM for
using Cell cycle kit from Millipore, according to the
manufactures’ instructions.

Real time RT-PCR Analysis
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol® reagent
(Invitrogen). 200 µg of RNA was treated with DNAse I
(Invitrogen) and reverse-transcribed with SuperscriptTM
first strand synthesis system (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR was carried
out with SYBR green (Applied Biosystem). Relative
expression levels for p21 were determined by real-time
RT-PCR from a standard curve of serial dilutions of cDNA
samples and were normalized to 18S expression.
The primers used were:
p21 Forward: 5’-GCAGACCAGCTGACAGATTT
p21 Reverse: 5’-GGATTAGGGCTTCCTCTTGGA
18S Forward: 5’-AACCCGTTGAACCCCATT
18S Reverse: 5’-CCATCCAATCGGTAGTAGCG

Immunofluorescence analysis
To evaluate cell proliferation, cells were grown
on coverslips and treated with A3 and/or gefitinib and
stimulated or not with HRG. After 24 hrs of incubation
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS
followed by treatment with 0.1 M glycine 0.1% Triton
X-100 for permeabilization. Incubation with anti-Ki67
antibody and secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG-Texas Red.
Nuclei were visualized with DAPI Percentage of Ki67positive cells was obtained counting for each treatment a
total of 500 cells, randomly observed in 10 microscopic
fields from three different experiments. Results have been
expressed as mean values ± standard errors (SE). p values
were calculated using Student’s t test and significance
level has been defined as p<0.05. Fluorescence was
visualized with ApoTome System (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) connected with an Axiovert 200 inverted
microscope (Zeiss); image analysis was then performed
by the Axiovision software and 3D reconstruction. The
mean ± standard error (SE) percent of colocalization
was calculated analyzing a minimum of 50 cells for
each treatment randomly taken from three independent
experiments.

In vivo efficacy studies
All studies have been performed in accordance
with “Directive 86/609/EEC on the protection of Animals
used for Experimental and other scientific purposes”
and made effective in Italy by the Legislative Decree
DL 116/92. 6-weeks old NOD/SCID mice (Charles
River Laboratories, Inc.) were utilized. After 1 week of
acclimatation they were housed five to a plastic cage and
fed on basal diet (4RF24, Mucedola S.r.l.) with water ad
libitum, in an animal facility controlled at a temperature
of 23 ± 2°C, 60 ± 5% humidity, and with a 12 h light
and dark cycle. All animal protocols used for this study
were reviewed and approved by BIOGEM Comitato Etico
per la Sperimentazione Animale (CESA) on 26 February
2010. Pe e/10 tumor xenograft have been obtained by
serially passaging tumors from previously subcutaneously
injected immunodeficient mice. Secondary xenograft have
been generated by injecting 1x106 cells/mouse obtained
by enzymatic dissociation of previously implanted
xenograft. Cell were resuspended in a 50% RGF matrigel
(BD Biosciences) solution in PBS and injected in the right
flank of the mice in 100 µl volume. Treatment started
when tumors reached a 100 mm3 volume and mice were
allocated five per group. Mice were treated with vehicle
(1%Tween80/1%beta-HPCD) or Gefitinib at 100 mg/kg,

Western blot analysis
Western was performed using NuPage Bis-Tris
electrophoresis system (Invitrogen). The total cellular
sample were washed twice in cold PBS and lysed in
RIPA buffer (Sigma). The protein concentration was
determined using BCA (Pierce). The total cellular protein
extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to
nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked with
5% milk or 5% BSA in 1X TBS containing 0,05% Tween
20 for 1 hr and incubated with horseradish peroxidaseconjucated antibodies (Sigma Aldrich). Signals were
visualized with enhanced chemiluminescent reagent
(Amersham).
