ABSTRACT
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway targeting agents have been
combined with other anticancer drugs, leading to improved efficacy in carcinoma of
the cervix, stomach, lung, colon and rectum, ovary, and breast. Vessel normalization
induced by VEGF pathway targeting agents influences tumor drug uptake. Following
bevacizumab treatment, preclinical and clinical studies have shown a decrease in
tumor delivery of radiolabeled antibodies and two chemotherapeutic drugs. The
decrease in vessel pore size during vessel normalization might explain the decrease
in tumor drug uptake. Moreover, the addition of bevacizumab to cetuximab, or
panitumumab in colorectal cancer patients or to trastuzumab in breast cancer patients,
did not improve efficacy. However, combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy did
increase efficacy in some cancer types. Novel biomarkers to select patients who may
benefit from combination therapies, such as the effect of an angiogenesis inhibitor
on tumor perfusion, requires innovative trial designs and large clinical trials. Small
imaging studies with radiolabeled drugs could be used in the interphase to gain
further insight into the interplay between VEGF targeted therapy, vessel normalization
and tumor drug delivery.

INTRODUCTION

and in colorectal cancer. VEGF pathway targeting drugs
have been added to other anticancer drugs to improve
their efficacy. This approach has only been successful in
carcinoma of the cervix, stomach, lung, colon, rectum,
ovary, and breast [5-7]. Improved understanding of the
underlying mechanisms could support rational drug
combinations.
Preclinical and clinical studies have indicated
that anti-VEGF therapy induces changes in function
and architecture of existing blood vessels, described as
vessel normalization [8]. Major characteristics of vessel
normalization are reduced number and size of immature
vessels, increased vessel pericyte coverage and reduced
interstitial fluid pressure (IFP) [8, 9].
Another consideration is that changes in tumor
vasculature caused by anti-VEGF therapy could also affect
tumor uptake of other drugs. If preclinical data could be

Angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer that enables
tumor growth [1]. Vascular endothelial growth factor
A (VEGF-A) is a key player in the process of tumor
angiogenesis, and the VEGF pathway has therefore been
an important focus for anti-cancer drug development [2,
3]. Although angiogenesis is recognized to enable tumor
growth, some tumors are capable of growing independent
of angiogenesis by vessel co-option [4].
Antiangiogenic treatment blocks the formation
of new blood vessels. The initially high hopes of VEGF
pathway targeting agents as panacea for treatment of
solid tumors have been replaced by a more realistic
definition of their role. Single agent activity has been
shown in renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma,
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, soft tissue sarcomas

used to predict the behavior of combination therapy, this
would be of great benefit in the clinic. At present, however,
translation of preclinical antiangiogenesis data to the clinic
remains challenging. We reviewed the literature on the
interplay between VEGF pathway targeting agents, vessel
normalization and tumor drug delivery in the preclinical
and clinical setting.

A recent meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and
safety of combining VEGFR TKIs with chemotherapy in
patients with solid tumors [22]. Data from 24 randomized
controlled trials with a total of 8,961 patients was
analyzed, with 879 patients participating in axitinib
trials, 3,761 in sorafenib trials, 1,970 in sunitinib trials
and 2,351 in vandetanib trials. The addition of VEGFR
TKIs to chemotherapy increased side effects. There was
an increase in any adverse events (relative risk 1.34, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 1.20 - 1.50, P < .001) and fatal
adverse events (relative risk 1.49, 95% Cl 1.16 - 1.90, P
= .002) [22].
Results from numerous phase 3 trials combining
VEGFR TKIs with chemotherapy showed only marginal
to no increased antitumor efficacy (Table 1). When
combined with chemotherapy in metastatic colorectal
cancer (mCRC), neither vatalanib (first- and second-line
treatment) nor sunitinib (first-line treatment ) increased
progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS)
[23-25]. In the randomized phase 3 HORIZON II trial,
combination of cediranib with chemotherapy led to a
clinically irrelevant increase of 0.3 months in PFS (HR
0.84, P = .012), and had no effect on OS as first-line
therapy in mCRC patients [26]. In addition, in metastatic
breast cancer sunitinib had no effect on PFS or OS when
combined with chemotherapy as first- and second-line
therapy [27, 28]. In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
addition of sorafenib to chemotherapy in the first-line
had no effect on OS [29, 30]. Combining vandetanib
with chemotherapy as second line NSCLC therapy in
the randomized phase 3 ZODIAC trial led to an increase
in PFS of 0.8 months (HR 0.79, P < .0001) [31]. The
randomized phase 3 ZEAL trial trial showed a positive
trend in PFS, but no significant increase, when vandetanib
was combined with chemotherapy in second-line treatment
[32]. In the LUME-Lung 1 randomized phase 3 trial, the
addition of nintedanib to chemotherapy in the second line
increased PFS with 0.7 months (HR 0.79, P = .002), but
did not increase OS. A beneficial effect of 2.3 months (HR
0.83, P = .036)on OS was only seen in the subgroup of
patients with a histological defined adenocarcinoma [33].
Recently, the randomized phase 2 CIRCCa trial in
metastatic and recurrent cervical cancer patients showed
that the addition of cediranib to chemotherapy improved
PFS with 1.4 months (HR 0.58, P = .032) compared to
placebo. However, the addition of cediranib did not
increase OS in these patients [34].
In recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM)
patients, combining cediranib with chemotherapy in the
randomized phase 3 REGAL trial did not increase PFS
and had no effect on OS [35]. A small prospective study
measured tumor blood perfusion changes with magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) during cediranib treatment
in 30 recurrent GBM patients to evaluate the vascular

Vessel normalization and VEGF-targeted agents
The vascular organization and structure of tumors
differs from normal tissue [10]. Tumor vasculature is more
tortuous and chaotic, with inadequate pericyte coverage,
increased breaches between endothelial cells and
alternating thick and thin basement membranes. This leads
to increased vessel permeability and high IFP causing
hypoxia [8, 9] Preclinical studies have shown that antiVEGF therapy can initiate vessel normalization. Vessel
normalization is measured in the preclinical and clinical
setting by decreased vessel diameter, blood volume, mean
vessel density (MVD), macromolecular permeability, IFP
and edema. Vessel normalization leads to an increase in
partial oxygen pressure and perivascular cell coverage in
the tumor [8, 9, 11-15]. In this review, we defined vessel
normalization as pruning and remodeling of abnormal
tumor vessels, leading to vessels resembling normal tissue
vasculature in terms of structure and function [8, 9].
Translating preclinical insights about vessel
normalization to the clinic has been challenging. This is
due in part to the differences between tumor-bearing mice
and human patients. Murine models with subcutaneous,
fast-growing human tumors are generally used [16, 17]. In
patients, primary tumor lesions can be located anywhere
in the body and usually are slow-growing, with doubling
times of months to years compared to weeks in murine
models. Even with metastatic disease, clinical progression
is generally much slower than in murine models. In
addition, preclinical models often comprise a single,
subcutaneous human tumor with murine vasculature.
These tumors are often treated for weeks, at most. In
patients, tumor and vasculature are of human origin, and
long-term treatment is required for optimal antitumor
effect. Furthermore, normal vasculature in patients will be
aged, as for most cancers incidence rates increase with
age [18]. To improve translation to the clinic, preclinical
studies should ideally be representative for the stage of
disease treated in the clinic, consist of tumor cells with
a compatible immunocompetent microenvironment and
examine combination therapies at appropriate dosages
analogous to the clinic [19-21].
At the moment several VEGF pathway targeting
agents are available. Registered drugs include small
molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) targeting the
VEGF receptors (VEGFR), and antibodies targeting
VEGF and VEGFR2.

normalizing effects of cediranib [36]. Tumor perfusion

(n = 14) [37]. Cediranib increased perfusion in 20 (50%)
patients, decreased perfusion in 10 (25%) patients, and
in 10 (25%) patients perfusion remained stable. These
changes occurred at day 1 and became stable around day

8. However, in one out of the 14 (7%) control patients,
perfusion increased with chemoradiation alone. In the
combination group, increased perfusion was associated
with a median OS of 26.3 months compared to 17.0 months
for patients without increased perfusion (P = .028). Based
on MRI analyses, these two studies show that cediranib
increased perfusion in a subgroup of GBM patients,
which correlated with increased survival. These results
suggested that increased tumor perfusion by cediranib
induced vessel normalization might lead to increased
tumor drug uptake and improved outcome in these patients
[36, 37]. In addition to these studies, preclinical studies
have shown that antiangiogenic therapy could potentiate
radiotherapy by improving tumor oxygenation [38]. In
randomized studies this did not translate to OS benefit.
In newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients 2 randomized
phase 3 trials, AVAglio and RTOG0825, studied the
effect of the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy
and radiotherapy. Both trials showed that the addition of
bevacizumab did improve PFS (4.2 months in AVAglio
(HR 0.64, P < .001) and 3.4 months in RTOG0825 (HR
0.79, P =.007), but had no effect on OS compared to
placebo [39, 40].
Blood flow and perfusion are closely related terms.
Strictly speaking blood flow is defined as blood volume

per time, whereas perfusion stands for blood volume per
time per amount of tissue. This means that blood flow can
be high, while perfusion e.g. as expressed per 100 g of
tissue is low. Accurate measurement of tumor perfusion is
of interest in determining effects of antiangiogenic therapy
or evaluating drug delivery. Interesting imaging modalities
to measure tumor perfusion in a noninvasive matter are
PET and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) CT or MRI. In
DCE imaging a contrast agent is given and images made
before, during and after injection are necessary to calculate
contrast concentrations in the area of interest. In case of
PET imaging, the tracer is injected and scans are made to
directly measure tracer uptake. During DCE-MRI or CT
imaging, contrast agents are used to measure perfusion.
These contrast agents are not freely diffusible, thus uptake
does not solely represent tumor perfusion. However
they also provide insight in vasculature permeability.
H215O-PET is a freely diffusible tracer, thereby directly
illustrating tumor perfusion. Furthermore, there is a linear
relation between H215O or contrast agent concentration
and signal intensity as measured by PET or DCE-CT,
which enables direct quantification. There is no linear
relationship between contrast agent concentration and
signal intensity as measured by DCE-MRI, complicating
quantification of tumor perfusion [41 - 43].

Figure 1: Hypothetical trial to evaluate tumor perfusion as a predictive biomarker for survival in GBM patients. To

identify the biomarker-positive cohort, initially all patients are randomized to chemoradiotherapy with or without cediranib. In a second
phase, only patients with increased perfusion after 8 days on treatment are randomized to continue chemoradiotherapy either with or
without cediranib.

To provide insight into the implications of
patient selection based on perfusion, we designed a
hypothetical trial using an enrichment design for primary
GBM patients treated with cediranib and/or standard
chemoradiotherapy (Figure 1) [44, 45]. In such a design,
the biomarker is evaluated in all randomized patients,
but only patients who are defined as biomarker-positive,
i.e. patients with increased tumor perfusion after 8
days on initial randomized treatment, are eligible for a
second randomization [45]. To identify the biomarkerpositive cohort, initially all patients are randomized
to chemoradiotherapy with or without cediranib. In a
second phase, only patients with increased perfusion
after 8 days on treatment are randomized to continue
chemoradiotherapy either with or without cediranib. The
OS would be compared between randomized arms, to
evaluate whether addition of cediranib provides benefit in
patients who achieved increased perfusion, irrespective of
the initial treatment that led to this increase. Patients with
decreased or stable perfusion would be taken off study and
complete standard chemoradiotherapy. The second study
phase requires 310 patients, to achieve 80% power at a
two-sided α of 5%, assuming an OS improvement of 35%
(HR = 0.65). This implies that 1,602 patients should have
been enrolled upfront in the first randomization, with 460
and 1142 patients initially randomized to treatment with or
without cediranib (respectively corresponding to 230 and
80 patients with increased perfusion at 8 days under initial
treatment). This is a very large number of GBM patients;
the landmark paper demonstrating the additive effect of
chemotherapy to first line radiotherapy in GBM required
573 patients, accrued during 20 months in 85 centers in 20
countries [44].

Addition of bevacizumab marginally affected PFS (13.7
months without versus 16.5 months with bevacizumab;
HR 0.82, P = .07). Another randomized phase 3 trial in
metastatic HER2 positive breast cancer patients also
showed that addition of bevacizumab to trastuzumab and
chemotherapy did not increase PFS (11.1 months without
versus 12.2 months with bevacizumab; HR 0.65, P = .10)
[49]. Furthermore, in the randomized phase 3 BETH trial
in early HER2 positive breast cancer patients the addition
of bevacizumab to trastuzumab and chemotherapy had no
effect on invasive disease free survival and OS at a median
follow up of 38 months [50].
It has been suggested that vessel normalization
could improve tumor drug uptake. In three small rectal
cancer studies, comprising 5, 6 and 32 patients, vessel
normalization induced by 5-10 mg/kg bevacizumab
was investigated with biopsies, IFP measurements and
functional computed tomography (CT) scans. At 12 days
after bevacizumab administration, IFP decreased and the
fraction of vessels covered with pericytes increased, while
the permeability-surface area product remained stable.
These findings indicate that bevacizumab induced vessel
normalization in these patients [51-53]. However, this
does not demonstrate a direct relationship between vessel
normalization and improved tumor drug uptake. Imaging
with radiolabeled drugs potentially provides a tool to
quantify tumor drug uptake. Both preclinical and clinical
studies have evaluated the effects of antiangiogenic
therapy on tumor drug uptake. At the University Medical
Center Groningen, we have developed 89Zr-labeled
bevacizumab and 89Zr-trastuzumab as tracers for positron
emission tomographic (PET) scanning to visualize and
quantify bevacizumab and trastuzumab biodistribution
for preclinical and clinical purposes [54-59]. These tracers
can provide insight into how bevacizumab affects uptake
of other antibodies. Despite limitations of animal models,
these human grade tracers allow translation of preclinical
findings to the clinic. In two xenograft models of human
HER2-positive ovarian cancer (SKOV-3) and esophageal
cancer (OE19) we used PET imaging to evaluate tumor
uptake of radiolabeled trastuzumab (SKOV-3 and OE19),
IgG (in SKOV-3) and bevacizumab (SKOV-3), before and
after bevacizumab treatment [60]. On day 6, after three
doses of 5 mg/kg bevacizumab, tumor uptake decreased
by 41% and 39% for trastuzumab in SKOV-3 and OE19,
respectively. For radiolabeled IgG and bevacizumab,
tumor uptake decreased by 28% and 44% respectively
after bevacizumab treatment. These results indicate that
bevacizumab treatment affected antibody tumor uptake
negatively. Bevacizumab therapy reduced microvessel
density (MVD) in tumors and increased vessel pericyte
coverage, indicating both anti-vascular and vessel
normalizing effects of bevacizumab.
Two other preclinical studies reported similar
results [61,62]. One 10 mg/kg dose of cross-reactive antiVEGF antibody B20-4.1 decreased tumor trastuzumab

Bevacizumab
So far, combining another antibody with
bevacizumab plus chemotherapy have shown detrimental
to modestly beneficial effects (Table 1). For mCRC,
combining bevacizumab, the anti-EGFR antibody
cetuximab and chemotherapy in the phase 3 CAIRO2
trial did not improve OS compared to bevacizumab with
chemotherapy alone. In fact, the addition of cetuximab
decreased PFS by 1.2 months (HR 1.22, P = .01) [46].
Furthermore, patients receiving cetuximab, bevacizumab
and chemotherapy experienced more cetuximab-related
side effects. Similar results were obtained in the phase 3
PACCE trial in mCRC patients receiving bevacizumab
with chemotherapy or bevacizumab, chemotherapy and the
anti-EGFR antibody panitumumab. In the panitumumab
group, PFS decreased by 1.4 months (HR 1.27) and no
effect was observed on OS [47].
In the phase 3 AVEREL trial in metastatic HER2
positive breast cancer patients, chemotherapy with
anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab or chemotherapy,
trastuzumab and bevacizumab was administered [48].

uptake by 50% after 2 days in a xenograft HER2-positive
breast cancer model (KPL-4) [61]. Moreover, 10 mg/kg
bevacizumab decreased tumor cetuximab uptake by 40%
after 4 days in EGFR-positive breast cancer xenograft
models (SUM149 and SKBR3) [62].
Importantly, these findings are supported in
the clinical setting. A study in patients with renal cell
carcinoma (n = 11) showed a 47% decrease of 89Zrbevacizumab tumor uptake 2 weeks after one therapeutic
infusion of 10 mg/kg bevacizumab [63]. Thus, vessel
normalization induced by bevacizumab seems to impair
tumor delivery of antibodies.
In addition, two clinical imaging studies suggest
bevacizumab also affects tumor drug delivery of
chemotherapeutic drugs. In NSCLC patients (n = 10), a
single dose of 15 mg/kg bevacizumab reduced 11C labeleddocetaxel tumor delivery by 22% after 5 hours and by
34% after 4 days [64]. Moreover, tumor drug delivery
of 18F-5-fluorouracil decreased by 20% at 24 hours after
a single administration of 7.5 mg/kg bevacizumab in
mCRC patients (n = 5) [65]. Phase 3 trials combining
bevacizumab with chemotherapy show varying results.
Bevacizumab combined with chemotherapy in colorectal,
ovarian, cervical and HER2-negative breast cancer has
shown an increase in PFS [66 - 70].
A small imaging study evaluated the effect of
bevacizumab on tumor perfusion and survival in 36
NSCLC patients [71]. Patients received a dose of 15mg/
kg bevacizumab as induction therapy, which after 14 days
was followed by the combination of carboplatin, nabpaclitaxel and bevacizumab for a maximum of 6 cycles
of 21 days. Blood flow, blood volume and permeability
surface, measured by CT, all decreased after induction
and during combination therapy. In addition, mean transit
time (MTT), a measurement for perfusion, showed a
slight increase during combination therapy. This reflects a
decrease in perfusion and was suggested to be associated
with shorter survival in these patients (P = .05). Together
with the cediranib imaging studies in GBM patients, these
results suggest that perfusion could be a potential readout for vessel normalization and a possible predictive
biomarker for survival [36, 37. 71].

decrease in pore size of tumor vasculature, resulting in
an increase of the penetration rate of small nanoparticles
(12 nm) but no difference in penetration rate for 60 and
120 nm size nanoparticles. This means that the effect of
DC101 on pore size was mainly based on the difference
in the transvascular flux of 12 nm particles in tumors with
and without DC101 treatment. Moreover, in the E0771
xenograft model treated with DC101, for example, a large
spread in transvascular flux of 12 nm nanoparticles was
already present in this group (from 0.05 - 0.3 µm s-1).
Such a substantial variation leads to a large uncertainty in
model outcomes on pore size, which was not discussed by
the authors. Since antibodies are approximately 12 nm in
size, similar to the small nanoparticles, it was suggested
that DC101-induced vessel normalization may also
improve tumor drug delivery of antibodies [74]. However,
although their size is similar, there are substantial
chemical differences between nanoparticles used in this
study and antibodies, which may affect penetration rate
[72, 73]. Firstly, nanoparticles are spherically shaped,
whereas antibodies are Y-shaped [75, 76]. Secondly, the
mass (density) of the nanoparticles and antibodies may
be different. Thirdly, the chemistry of the outer shell of
the nanoparticles used in this study is different than the
chemistry of antibodies [72]. The PIL-coated 12 nm size
nanoparticles have mainly methoxy (R-O-CH3) functional
end groups in the outer shell, and the PEG-coated 60 and
125 nm particles have hydroxyl (R-OH) functional end
groups. On the other hand, antibodies, which can be seen
as a combination of four biopolymers, mainly have R-NH2
and R-COOH end groups [75, 76]. These differences can
make it difficult to translate results from these specific
nanoparticles to “nanomedicines” such as antibodies.
This important study also investigated whether
DC101-induced vessel normalization could improve
efficacy of small chemotherapeutics [72]. Mice were
treated with DC101, placebo, DC101 or placebo plus
abraxane (albumin-bound paclitaxel, ø = 10 nm) and
DC101 or placebo plus doxil (liposome-encapsulated
doxorubicin, ø = 100 nm). Tumor doubling times were
used as read-out for efficacy. Both DC101 alone and
DC101 plus doxil had no effect on tumor doubling times
compared to placebo or doxil plus placebo. However,
DC101 plus abraxane did increase tumor doubling times
compared to placebo plus abraxane. From these data it was
concluded that the vessel-normalizing effects of DC101
increased tumor penetration of abraxane. The results of
control experiments in this article showed a large range
in tumor doubling times in the placebo plus doxil group,
which might have influenced the results for this group.
In the clinic, VEGFR2 antibody ramucirumab, which
is administered at much lower doses than in the mouse
model, has shown very modest or no effect in 5 phase 3
clinical trials (Table 1). Ramucirumab monotherapy (8
mg/kg every 2 weeks) increased PFS by 0.8 months (HR:
0.48, P < .0001) and prolonged OS by 1.4 months (HR:

VEGFR2 antibodies
Intravital imaging showed that DC101, an antibody
against mouse VEGFR2, induced vessel normalization in
an orthotopic mammary tumor model [72]. This particular
study is a key paper as it provided insight into the effect
of vessel normalization on pore size of tumor vasculature.
The nanoparticles used were quantum dots coated
with polymeric imidazole ligand (PIL) (ø = 12 nm) or
polyethylene glycol (PEG) (ø = 60 and 120 nm) [73]. Pore
size was determined by modeling nanoparticle penetration
rate, given as transvascular flux per unit vascular surface
area. Vessel normalization by DC101 coincided with a

0.77, P = .047) in gastric cancer and esophageal junction
adenocarcinoma patients in the second line [77]. Adding
ramucirumab (8 mg/kg every 2 weeks) to paclitaxel
increased PFS from 2.9 months to 4.4 months (HR 0.63,
P < .0001) and prolonged OS by 2.3 months from 7.4
to 9.6 months (HR 0.80, P = .017) in advanced gastric
and esophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients [78].
In addition, in NSCLC patients, 10 mg/kg ramucirumab
every 3 weeks combined with docetaxel increased PFS by
1.5 months (HR 0.76, P < .0001) and prolonged OS by 1.4
months (HR 0.86, P = .023) as second-line therapy [79].
In mCRC, FOLFIRI combined with 8 mg/kg ramucirumab
prolonged OS compared to FOLFIRI with placebo with
1.6 months from 11.7 to 13.3 months (HR 0.85, P =
.02) in the second line [80]. However, in breast cancer
patients, 10 mg/kg ramucirumab every 3 weeks combined
with docetaxel did not affect PFS or OS [81]. The FDA
recently approved ramucirumab for advanced gastric and
esophageal junction adenocarcinoma, metastatic NSCLC
and mCRC patients.

reduced antibody uptake after antiangiogenic therapy. A
possible explanation for decreased uptake could be the
change in vessel pore size during vessel normalization.
This might influence tumor drug uptake, depending on the
size, shape and chemical structure of the drug. New data
from a different angle are in line with this interpretation.
Wong et al. performed a study in NSCLC and pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma tumor models with low-dose
cilengitide, an antiangiogenic agent selectively inhibiting
αν integrins, and verapamil [87]. The combination therapy
led to an increase in blood flow and perfusion, MVD and
vascular permeability in these tumors.
Moreover, addition of gemcitabine (75 mg/
kg) or cisplatin (6 mg/kg) to the combination therapy
reduced tumor growth and progression compared to
placebo, gemcitabine or cisplatin treatment alone. Highperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry
showed that cilengitide combined with verapamil
increased intratumoral drug delivery of gemcitabine.
Overall these findings indicate that tumor angiogenesis
or even vascular promotion therapy could improve drug
delivery.
Most research concerning vessel normalization
has been performed on primary tumors. Preclinical and
clinical studies have shown that vessel normalization is
a delicate process, occurring during a certain timeframe
and dependent on the dose of the antiangiogenic drug [9].
However, it remains unclear how vessel normalization
will occur in the metastasized setting. In normal healthy
tissue, tissue-specific vessel functions illustrate vessel
heterogeneity for different organs [88]. This also applies to
the tumor vasculature, and indeed, different types of tumor
blood vessels have been identified [89, 90]. In NSCLC
patients, for instance, the primary tumor and matched
brain metastases differed in MVD, vessel maturity and
VEGF expression [91].
Finally, regarding vessel normalization there is a
need for a biomarker to evaluate this process in different
tumor types and stages. Tumor perfusion is a potential
biomarker to select patients who may benefit from
combinations of antiangiogenic and other drugs. However,
assessing the role of tumor perfusion requires innovative
study designs and extensive clinical trials. A possible
tool to eventually improve drug delivery to individual
tumors, and thereby optimize outcomes of combination
therapies, could be in vivo imaging of labeled drugs. This
might clarify the interplay between vessel normalization
and tumor drug delivery. Small clinical trials could be
performed to visualize the effects of antiangiogenic drugs
on the distribution of other labeled drugs, to provide serial
information on whole body drug distribution, and to guide
rational trial design for large combinatorial studies.

DISCUSSION
To date, preclinical studies have shown that
antiangiogenic therapy can induce vessel normalization.
Clinical studies have illustrated that this is not just
a preclinical phenomenon; it also occurs in patients.
Although some studies have suggested that vessel
normalization can improve drug delivery of chemotherapy
and enhance efficacy of combination therapies, there
is no direct evidence for better tumor drug uptake. On
the contrary, both preclinical and clinical studies with
radioactive labeled drugs have shown decreased tumor
delivery of antibodies as well as chemotherapeutic agents.
In the case of chemotherapy, this did not inevitably result
in the absence of an additional effect of combination
therapy, although it may explain the disappointing
results and lack of synergism. In addition to vessel
normalization, other mechanisms have been proposed to
explain how antiangiogenic agents can improve efficacy
of chemotherapy. Certain chemotherapeutic agents can
have a local antiangiogenic effect by affecting endothelial
cells. This can result in an increased mobilization of
circulating endothelial progenitor cells, again promoting
tumor angiogenesis. The addition of an antiangiogenic
agent can thus counteract this response, thereby improving
efficacy of chemotherapy. Furthermore, in response to
chemotherapy VEGF and VEGF-receptor expression by
tumor cells can increase. The addition of an antiangiogenic
agent can subsequently enhance the anti-proliferative
action of chemotherapy. Another mechanism proposed
is that antiangiogenic agents can inhibit tumor cell
repopulation in between chemotherapy cycles, thereby
