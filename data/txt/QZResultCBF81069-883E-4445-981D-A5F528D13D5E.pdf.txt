BACKGROUD: The 17p13.1 deletion that causes loss of the p53-encoding TP53 gene is the most powerful
predictor of a poor response to conventional therapy and shortened survival in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The results of this study have demonstrated that the cladribine and cyclophosphamide regimen may improve treatment results in this poor-risk patient population. METHODS: In this
study, the authors retrospectively analyzed the efficacy and toxicity of 2-CdA with cyclophosphamide combination (the CC regimen) in 20 patients with previously untreated B-cell CLL who had 17p13.1 deletion
reported to the Polish Adult Leukemia Group (PALG) registry. The CC regimen consisted of 2-CdA at a
dose of 0.12 mg/kg and cyclophosphamide at a dose of 250 mg/m2 given intravenously for 3 consecutive
days. The CC cycles were repeated at 28-day intervals for up to 6 cycles. RESULTS: Overall, 16 of 20
patients (80%) responded to CC therapy, including 10 patients (50%) who obtained a complete response
and 6 patients (30%) who obtained a partial response. The median progression-free survival reached 23
months (95% confidence interval, 5-41 months). The overall survival probability at 2 years was 52.5% (95%
confidence interval, 26%-79%). Treatment toxicity generally was acceptable. Infections were the most common grade 3/4 complications and occurred in 6 patients (30%). CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective analysis, the results demonstrated that the CC regimen produced a relatively high response rate in patients with
previously untreated CLL who had 17p13.1/TP53 deletion, although the response duration and survival were

KEY WORDS: chronic lymphocytic leukemia, cladribine, 17p13 deletion, TP53, p53.

Despite the generally long-lasting course of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in a proportion of patients,
the disease progresses rapidly with drug resistance and a
poor outcome. In recent years, novel molecular prognostic
factors in CLL were identified, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IgVH) mutational status,
CD38 and ZAP-70 expression, and cytogenetic abnormalities.1 It is noteworthy that the 17p13.1 deletion is the
most powerful predictor of a poor prognosis in patients
with CLL of all biologic factors that have been identified
to date.2 The negative impact of 17p13.1 deletion is
attributed to the loss of the TP53 gene encoding for the
p53 protein.2,3 The deletion of 1 TP53 allele frequently is
accompanied by TP53 mutations in the other allele,
resulting in the total disruption of the p53 pathway.4 The
17p13.1 deletion is detected by interphase fluorescence in
situ hybridization (FISH) in approximately 5% of
patients with B-cell CLL (B-CLL) on frontline therapy
and in much a higher proportion of patients with refractory/relapsing disease.2,4
The purine nucleoside analogues (PNA) fludarabine
(FA) and cladribine (2-chlorodeoxyadenosine [2-CdA])
induce more durable responses than alkylator-based therapies and play a central role in the current management of
CLL.5,6 Moreover, PNA combinations with cyclophosphamide are more active compared with PNA monotherapy, as revealed in recent phase 3 prospective trials.7-10
However, numerous reports have indicated that patients
with 17p13.1 deletions/TP53 abnormalities respond
poorly to PNA, and most of those reports referred to FA
monotherapy and FA combinations.7,9-11 Those findings
have translated into current opinion that patients with
p53 dysfunction should be treated with novel p53-independent agents rather than PNAs.12
Little data are available on the clinical efficacy of 2CdA or 2-CdA-based combinations in patients with
17p13.1/TP53 abnormalities; however, some differences
in cytotoxicity mechanisms between 2-CdA and FA have
been postulated.13 Unlike many other countries, in
Cancer

January 1, 2009

Poland, 2-CdA is more frequently used than FA in CLL,
and the combination of 2-CdA with cyclophosphamide
(the CC regimen) has become a widely used frontline
treatment for younger patients.8 Taking this into consideration, we evaluated the outcome of first-line therapy
with the CC regimen in patients with CLL who had the
17p13.1 deletion reported to Polish Adult Leukemia
Group (PALG) registry.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
This study was a retrospective analysis that included all
patients with CLL who were reported to the PALG registry between January 2004 and December 2007 and fulfilled 2 inclusion criteria: 1) they carried a 17p13.1
deletion, as determined by pretreatment FISH interphase
cytogenetics; and 2) they were treated according to the
CC protocol as upfront therapy. The diagnosis of CLL
was based on the criteria established by the National Cancer Institute-Sponsored Working Group (NCI-WG).14
Pretreatment clinical staging was performed according to
the Rai classification.15 Indications to start treatment for
CLL were based on evidence of disease progression using
previously reported criteria.8

Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization Analysis
FISH was performed on interphase nuclei of lymphocytes
on blood smears before the start of the study treatment.
Four commercial probes were used (Vysis, Bergish-Gladbach, Germany), including the microsatellite chromosome 12 probe D12Z3 and the unique sequence- or
region-specific DNA probes p53 (17p13.1.1 locus), ATM
(11q22.3 locus), and D13S319 (13q14.3 locus). Signals
were counted in at least 200 interphase nuclei for each
sample. To define the cutoff level for the deletions and
trisomy 12, experiments were performed on peripheral
95

Original Article

blood smears from 10 healthy controls. A true deletion
was considered to occur if the specimen under study
exhibited greater than a mean  standard deviation of 3
nuclei with only 1 signal (referring to deletions) or with 3
signals (referring to trisomy 12). On this basis, the cutoff
level was set at 8.4% for 13q14 deletion, 8.8% for 11q22
deletion, 9.6% for 17p13.1 deletion, and 5% for trisomy
12.

Treatment Modality
The CC regimen consisted of 2-CdA 0.12 mg/kg over 30
minutes as an intravenous infusion and cyclophosphamide 250 mg/m2 intravenously, and both drugs were
administered concurrently for 3 consecutive days. 2-CdA
was available commercially from the Institute of Biotechnology and Antibiotics-Bioton (Warsaw, Poland). The
CC cycles were repeated every 28 days up to maximum of
6 cycles. In patients who had severe, therapy-related infections or hematologic complications, the consecutive cycle
was delayed until hematologic parameters improved or
the patient recovered from infection. To prevent hyperuricemia, allopurinol was administered at dose of 300 mg
daily. No routine prophylactic antibiotics, antiviral
agents, or growth factors were administered. Patients who
developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA),
immune thrombocytopenia (IT), or nonhematologic
grade 3 or 4 toxicity during chemotherapy were excluded
from further treatment with CC.

Response Criteria and Toxicity Monitoring
Treatment efficacy was assessed according to NCI-WG
guidelines.14 A complete response (CR) required the absence of symptoms and organomegaly, a normal blood
cell count (absolute lymphocyte count, <4  109/L; absolute neutrophil count, >1.5  109/L; hemoglobin concentration, >110 g/L; and platelet count, >100  109/
L), bone marrow that contained <30% lymphocytes for
at least 2 months, and no lymphoid infiltrate in bone marrow biopsy performed 2 months after clinical evidence of
CR. Partial response (PR) criteria were a decrease 50%
in the size of enlarged lymph nodes, spleen, and liver on
physical examination and peripheral blood counts either
identical to those for a CR or improved over pretreatment
values by 50%. Patients with a nodular PR were ana96

lyzed as PRs. Hematologic toxicity was evaluated according to the criteria of the NCI-WG.14 Other side effects
were assessed and monitored according to World Health
Organization criteria. Infections were classified as treatment-related if they developed on treatment or within 4
months after the completion of chemotherapy.

Statistical Analysis
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as time from
the start of the treatment to the time of disease progression, death, or last observation in remission. Overall survival (OS) was recorded as the time from treatment
initiation to the time of either death from any cause or last
contact. Probabilities of PFS and OS were estimated
according to the Kaplan-Meier method and are given with
95% confidence intervals (95% CI).16 Statistical analyses
were performed using the SPSS statistical software package for Windows (release 11.01; SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill).

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics
In total, 20 patients with B-CLL who had 17p13.1 deletion and were treated upfront with CC were included in
this study. Nine patients (45%) received therapy within
an ongoing phase 3 PALG trial that compared the CC
regimen to with FA plus cyclophosphamide (FC) in
patients with previously untreated, progressive CLL (the
PALG-CLL3 trial).17 The remaining 11 patients (55%)
were treated outside clinical trials with an identical CC
protocol. The analyzed group consisted of 13 men (65%)
and 7 women (35%), and their median age at diagnosis
was 59.4 years (range, 32.9-74.3 years). Patients’ hematologic parameters at the start if therapy were as follows: median white cell blood count, 49.3  109/L (range, 15.7358  109/L); median hemoglobin concentration, 14.1
g/dL (range, 10.4-15 g/dL); and median platelet count,
155  109/L (range, 12-264  109/L). On the basis of
clinical and laboratory findings, 16 patients (80%) were
classified with a low clinical stage (Rai 0-II), and the
remaining 4 patients (20%) were classified with an
advanced stage (Rai III or IV). The median disease duration from diagnosis to treatment initiation was 0.8 years
(range, 0-1.7 years).

FISH analysis revealed 17p13.1 deletion as the sole
aberration in malignant cells from 11 patients (55%). In
blood samples from 9 patients (45%), additional aberrations were detected, including 13q14 deletion in 7
patients, 11q22 deletion in 1 patient, and trisomy 12 in
1 patient. Data on CD38 and ZAP-70 pretreatment
expression levels were available in 3 patients, and IgVH
mutational status was not evaluated in this patient group.
The detailed baseline patient characteristics are shown in
Table 1.
Treatment Efficacy and Toxicity
The total number of administered CC cycles was 78 (median, 4 CC cycles per patient; range, 1-6 CC cycles per
patient). Overall, 16 of 20 included patients responded to
the CC regimen, yielding a significant overall response
rate (ORR) of 80% (Table 2). A CR was confirmed in 10
patients (50%), and 6 patients (30%) achieved a PR.
Responses to treatment in individual patients are listed in

toxicities, the most frequent were infections, which were
diagnosed in 6 patients (30%) patients. Autoimmune
complications were identified in 4 treated patients (20%)
and included 2 episodes of AIHA and 2 episodes of IT. In
1 patient, Richter transformation was observed. The most
common treatment side effects are listed in Table 2.

DISCUSSION
In this study, we observed that a relatively high proportion
of patients with previously untreated CLL who had
98

17p13.1/TP53 deletion responded to the CC regimen. A
response was observed in 80% of patients, and there was a
significant CR rate of 50%. Our findings are of interest
in the context of previous reports on the poor efficacy
of PNAs and PNA combinations in p53-defective
patients.7,10,11,18,19 In contrast to our results, in a United
Kingdom CLL trial, no patients with TP53 deletion in
>20% of CLL cells obtained a CR or a nodular PR with
the FC regimen, and the predicted PFS in this group was
0% at 3 years.10 Similarly, a poor response to FA with cyclophosphamide and mitoxantrone was reported with no
CRs in a Spanish single-arm study.20 Despite the relatively high ORR observed in our study, the remission
durations were short, with a median PFS of 23 months
and a median OS rate of 52.5% at 2 years (Fig. 1). This
seems comparable to the response durations achieved with
FC therapy. In the United States Intergroup trial E2997,
the presence of 17p13.1 deletion was associated with a
median PFS of 12 months in the FC arm.18 Furthermore,
a German CLL trial comparing FC with FA revealed that,
in patients who had the deletion, the median survival was
only 15.9 months.19
It is noteworthy that a recent phase 3 trial produced
longer responses with 2-CdA than with FA in patients
with previously untreated CLL.21 In the last interim analysis of our ongoing PALG-CLL3 study, the global
response rates were comparable in the CC and FC arms,
but significantly more patients with 17p13.1 deletion
responded to CC than to FC.22 However, it should be
noted that the final results of this trial are not yet available, and the current numbers of patients with 17p13.1
deletion are relatively small. FA and 2-CdA are able to
kill proliferating cells as well as quiescent cells, and they
share similar complex and not fully understood mechanisms of cytotoxicity.23-25 The main mechanism is
related to DNA damage leading to the induction of p53
and the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis activation.24
However, at least in resting cells, the cytotoxicity exerted
by FA and 2-CdA also involves p53-independent pathways.25 In agreement with this finding, p53 abnormalities (including 17p13.1 deletion, TP53 mutations, and
TP53þ promoter methylation) correlate with a poor
response to FA but do not predict response in individual
patients with CLL.26 More noteworthy are laboratory
studies suggesting that 2-CdA and 2-chloro-2’-arafluoroadenine (clofarabine), but not FA, can induce cell death

by direct mitochondrial injury, which may explain in
part the potential differences in toxicity of 2-CdA and
FA against p53-defective cells.13 Moreover, incomplete
cross resistance between 2-CdA and FA in vitro and in
vivo has been reported.27,28
It is believed generally that p53-defective patients
are unlikely to respond to conventional chemotherapy,
including PNAs; thus, alternative non-p53-dependent
agents are recommended.12 A humanized, anti-CD52
antibody, alemtuzumab, was able to induce a CR in some
refractory patients with 17p13.1 deletion.29,30 Other
treatment options include high-dose corticosteroids, flavopiridol, and allogeneic stem cell transplantation with
reduced-intensity conditioning regimens.31-34 Recently,
Byrd and colleagues reported that combination of FA
with an anti-CD20 antibody rituximab induced a PR in
all 3 treated patients who had a 17p13.1 deletion, but the
responses were of short duration.35 In our recent study,
34 of 46 patients (74%) who had heavily pretreated CLL
responded to rituximab combined with 2-CdA (RC) or
rituximab combined with CC and had a median PFS of
12 months, but FISH analysis was beyond the scope of
that study.36 Whether such immunochemotherapy is
more active against CLL with 17p13.1 deletion than classic PNA combinations needs to be verified in controlled
randomized trials. Furthermore, the p53 dysfunction
probably is not the only cause of drug resistance in CLL
with 17p13.1 deletion, because it correlates with negative prognostic factors like as IgVH unmutated status,
high ZAP-70 expression level, and chromosomal
translocations.37,38
In conclusion, this retrospective analysis demonstrated that the CC regimen induced a relatively high
response rate in patients with previously untreated CLL
patients who had 17p13.1/TP53 deletion, although the
duration of the achieved responses and survival were not
satisfactory. It is possible that a combination of the CC
regimen with p53-independent agents may improve treatment results in this poor-risk patient population
