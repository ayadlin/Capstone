Abstract
Herein, we evaluated for the first time silibinin efficacy on
prostate cancer (PCa) metabolism in transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model using quantitative
high-resolution proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy metabolomics. Prostate tissues were from mice fed
control or silibinin diet for 20 weeks. Comparative metabolic
profiling indicated that antitumor effect of silibinin is
accompanied by alteration in metabolic profile of TRAMP
prostatic tumors as indicated by 6-fold (P = 0.016) increase in
glucose content and 48% (P = 0.015) reduction in lactate levels.
Increase in citrate use by prostate tissue also reversed with
silibinin, as indicated by 3-fold (P = 0.01) increase in citrate
levels in silibinin-fed group. Also, 61% and 50% (P < 0.01)
decrease in cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine levels, respectively, was observed with silibinin. These results corroborate
our earlier findings regarding PCa chemopreventive potential
of silibinin in TRAMP model and warrant additional metabolic
profiling in other silibinin-fed PCa tumor model tissues. This
will help identify specific metabolic biomarkers altered during
silibinin treatment, which when detected in clinical biopsies
or noninvasive magnetic resonance spectroscopic studies could
help monitor silibinin effectiveness against PCa malignancy.

Introduction
Recent studies have shown that metabolic profile of various
cancerous/noncancerous tissues can be correlated with cell
growth/death, specific tumor type, and pathologic stage of tumor
(1–4). In this regard, metabolomics of prostatic tissues using
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (in both in vivo and in vitro
conditions) has helped to identify and establish the metabolic
profiles specific to prostate cancer (PCa) malignancy (1, 5). Specific
metabolic alterations, due to progression of tumor lesions in PCa
patients, include a significant decrease of citrate (zinc metabolism),
increased phosphocholine and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho;
phospholipid turnover), and increased glucose uptake in cancerous
lesions (3, 5).
We recently reported PCa inhibitory effects of silibinin in various
studies (6) and on PCa progression in transgenic adenocarcinoma
of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mice (7). The chemopreventive
efficacy of silibinin on TRAMP prostate tumor growth, progression,
invasion, migration, and metastasis was subsequently evaluated

and established, together with analyses of the protein molecules
possibly involved with silibinin efficacy (8). From a broader
viewpoint, the limitation of this study was that silibinin efficacy
was not discussed in terms of metabolic stabilization in prostate
tumors. With the rationale that evaluation of anticancer efficacy of
a drug is incomplete without determining its effect on metabolic
profile of the tumor tissue, we carried out a metabolomics study on
prostate tissues. We used quantitative high-resolution proton
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMRS) to assess
the metabolic profile of silibinin-treated TRAMP prostatic tissue to
complement histopathologic and molecular data generated earlier
(6–8). The working hypothesis was that, upon silibinin treatment,
specific metabolic biomarkers will sensitively detect changes in
prostate tissue. Such a study would, inarguably, not only provide us
with a complete scenario of silibinin chemopreventive efficacy
against PCa progression in TRAMP mice, but in terms of practical
and translational aspects, further validate the clinical usefulness of
this drug.

Materials and Methods
Prostate tissue. Archival (7) dorsolateral prostate tissue (n = 4) samples,
stored at 80jC, of TRAMP/C57BL/6 mice fed control (n = 17) or 1%
silibinin-supplemented diet starting age 4 wk for 20 wk (n = 16), were used
to assess metabolic profile of tissues. All retrospective studies have been
previously approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Sample preparation. Prostate tissues were extracted using 8%
perchloric acid as previously described (4, 9). Briefly, f0.1 grams of frozen
tissues were processed, and extracted hydrophilic metabolites were dissolved in 0.45 mL of deuterium oxide while lipids were dissolved in 0.6 mL
of deuterated chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, v/v) before 1H-NMRS. All
deuterated compounds were from Cambridge Isotope, Inc.
Quantitative 1H-NMR analysis. 1H-NMRS analyses were performed by
NJS (blinded to the group assignment of samples) using a 500 MHz Bruker
DRX system equipped with Bruker TopSpin software (Bruker Biospin, Inc.;
ref. 9). An inverse TXI 5-mm probe was used for all experiments. To
suppress water residue in extracts, a standard Bruker water presaturation
sequence was used (‘‘zgpr’’). An external reference, trimethylsilyl propionic2,2,3,3,-d4 acid (0.5 mmol/L for hydrophilic and 1.2 mmol/L for lipid
extracts), was used for metabolite quantification of fully relaxed 1H-NMR
spectra and as a 1H chemical shift reference (0 ppm). For metabolite
identification, a two-dimensional -1H, 13C-HSQC (heteronuclear single
quantum correlation) NMR sequence was used. The 1H-NMR peaks
for single metabolites were identified and referred to a metabolite
chemical shift library. The absolute concentrations of single metabolites
were then referred to the trimethylsilyl propionic-2,2,3,3,-d4 acid integral
and calculated using one-dimensional WINNMR (Bruker Biospin, Inc.;
ref. 9).

Results
From each prostate tissue, 38 individual water-soluble and lipid
metabolites were quantified (Table 1). We also included 4 significant metabolite ratios into the Principle component analysis

and the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids contributed to the group
clustering.
One of the most important findings in this study is the preserved
citrate concentration in prostate upon silibinin treatment, as
indicated by f3-fold (P < 0.01) increase in citrate levels in silibinin
group (Fig. 2A). That the citrate generated for normal secretion
functions of the prostate and zinc metabolism was not further used
for cholesterol synthesis was indicated by 61% decrease (P < 0.04)
in cholesterol levels in silibinin-fed group, indicating decreased
cholesterogenesis (Fig. 2C).
Furthermore, a significant decrease in glucose use was seen in
silibinin-fed animals. Increased glucose uptake, due to high energy
requirement and high aerobic glycolytic activity—one of the major
hallmarks of tumor metabolism—usually results in decreased
intracellular glucose concentrations and high levels of lactate
(10, 11). In our study, a significant increase in intracellular glucose
(P < 0.01) with simultaneous decrease in lactate (P < 0.01) and

alanine (P < 0.03; end-products of glycolysis) were seen after
silibinin-feeding (Fig. 2A). Thus, the glycolytic coefficient (ratio of
intracellular lactate to intracellular glucose) was decreased from
26.68 in controls to 2.66 in silibinin-fed animals (P < 0.05; Table 1;
Fig. 2A).
Another significant metabolic pathway for tumor development is
increased phospholipid turnover in cancer cells, due to their high
proliferation rates (12). In a variety of tumors, PtdCho, the major
phospholipid in cell membrane, is increased (13, 14). Silibinin not
only decreased PtdCho values in prostate (P < 0.03; Fig. 2B), but
also significantly altered PtdCho synthesis and catabolism, thus
providing an evidence for targeted cell growth inhibition. The ratio
of phosphocholine (phosphocholine-PtdCho precursor) to GPC
(GPC-PtdCho catabolism) was significantly decreased after silibinin treatment (P < 0.04), mostly due to an increase in GPC
concentrations (P < 0.01). Moreover, a significant inhibition of
PtdCho synthesis can be seen in accumulation of cytosolic

Discussion

choline to cytosolic choline decreased from 67.6 to 4.1 in silibinin-fed
animals (P < 0.0001; Table 1; Fig. 2B).
Increased concentrations of osmolyte myo-inositol (P < 0.0001)
and other polyols (P < 0.03) were also observed in silibinin-fed
group (Fig. 2C). Normal prostate glands express relatively high
concentrations of polyols compared with PCa lesions. Higher levels
of glutathione (P < 0.04) and decreased (poly-unsaturated fatty
acids/monounsaturated fatty acids) ratios (P < 0.05) indicated

PCa progression in TRAMP mice mimics human PCa, developing
spontaneous progressive stages of the prostatic disease with time
(15–17). Earlier studies in TRAMP model indicate that silibinin
reduces prostate adenocarcinoma incidence by slowing down
tumor progression from prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia (premalignant) to adenocarcinoma (malignant) stages (7).
In the present study, metabolic profiling of TRAMP prostate
tissues seemed to be highly sensitive to oral silibinin supplementation. Silibinin-related metabolic changes include the following:
(a) normalization of citrate concentrations ( for normal secretary
functions of prostate), (b) decrease of glucose use and glycolytic
activity, (c) decrease in membrane phospholipid synthesis, and (d)
increase in polyols and antioxidants in prostate.
The results indicate that there is decreased glucose use by the
prostatic tissue upon silibinin-feeding, which suggests decreased
bioenergy requirements via fast glycolysis compared with untreated tumors that are highly proliferative and consume more glucose
to meet their increased energy requirements. Thus, due to high
activity of aerobic glycolysis in the untreated tumors, an increase in
the end products of glycolysis (lactate and alanine) can be seen.
There was also a significant reduction in lactate and alanine levels
in silibinin-treated prostatic tissue, which resulted in decreased
glycolytic coefficient.
Alteration in citrate levels upon PCa progression in TRAMP mice
was found to mimic human PCa scenario, where a decrease in
citrate levels is observed due to its increased use in Krebs cycle as
well as to abnormal secretion functions and zinc metabolism. In
normal human prostate, the glandular epithelial cells follow a
metabolic pathway unlike other normal tissues (11, 18). In normal
prostate epithelial cells (PEC), citrate is not a utilizable intermediate in Krebs cycle but an end product. This is likely due to
accumulation of high levels of zinc in PEC of peripheral zone (the
zone involved in PCa malignancy) than in other normal tissues
(19). Zinc is involved in inhibition of m-aconitase (which converts
citrate into iso-citrate in Krebs cycle), which results in an increase
in net citrate production; the high amount of citrate is then
secreted in the prostatic fluid. Thus, normal PEC unlike other
normal mammalian cells are citrate-producing cells (18). Unlike
other tumor types that end up being citrate producing, the
malignant PEC have decreased levels of citrate as a consequence of
decreased amounts of zinc (18). As a result, m-aconitase activity is
not inhibited and citrate is used by the Krebs cycle. Although in
normal PEC, 60% of energy derived from glucose is wasted due to
citrate secretion, in malignant PEC, use of citrate in the Krebs cycle
causes increased energy production and fatty acid synthesis to
fulfill energy requirement of the fast proliferating PEC (18). These
altered metabolic phenotype explains morphologic transformation
from normal secretion cells to the fast proliferative tumor cells and
is an essential metabolic adaptation to meet the increased
bioenergetic demands of the neoplastic cells (11, 20). In the
present study, one of the most significant observations was that
silibinin was able to cause a reversal of citrate use in tumor cells
and helped preserve the citrate concentration in prostatic tissue as
it occurs in normal prostatic tissue, i.e., silibinin was able to restore
the citrate producing characteristic and secretion functions of the

prostatic tissue. Furthermore, decrease in cholesterogenesis
indicated that increased citrate was not being used for this process.
A variety of cancerous tissues including that of prostate exhibit
altered metabolic profile of choline pathway intermediates (12, 13),
specifically, the malignant tissues are characterized by elevated
levels of PtdCho, the major membrane phospholipid, along with high
levels of its precursor, phosphocholine (13, 14). Silibinin significantly
decreased PtdCho levels and altered the PtdCho turnover in
prostatic tissue as evidenced by increased GPC levels (PtdCho
catabolic product) and a decrease in the content of lipid derived
choline. The decreased ratio of phosphocholine/GPC by silibinin was
also an interesting observation, as in some cancer cells, a switch
from high GPC levels and low phosphocholine levels to low GPC and
high levels of phosphocholine has been observed with increased
malignancy (13). Whether this decrease in ratio by silibinin in
TRAMP prostate can be interpreted as a positive inhibitory effect
specific to TRAMP or is a general interference in choline phospholipid metabolism by silibinin, needs to be further investigated.
Silibinin feeding also significantly increased polyol levels that are
significantly decreased during prostate tumor progression. There
was also a significant increase in total glutathione levels in
prostatic tissue by silibinin feeding compared with untreated
controls, indicating that silibinin plays an inhibitory role in the
progression of PCa by increasing the levels of the antioxidant
glutathione, which serves as a free radical scavenger.
Whether the inhibitory effects of silibinin on PCa progression in
TRAMP mice are via a direct interference in the metabolic pathway

has on the malignant tissue via a genomic/proteomic response

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of its kind,
where the chemopreventive efficacy of an agent has also been
evaluated in terms of the metabolomics of the tumors. The results
corroborate our earlier findings and indicate the essential need to
carry out such metabolic profiling in various other PCa tumor
model tissues after treatment with a chemopreventive agent,
including silibinin, so as to help identify the specific metabolites
altered during the course of treatment, which when detected in
clinical biopsies or noninvasive MRS studies can confirm the
effectiveness of the agent against PCa malignancy.
