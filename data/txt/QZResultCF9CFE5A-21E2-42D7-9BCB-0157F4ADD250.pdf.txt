ABSTRACT
Background: Tumor deposits (TDs) were reported to be poor prognoses in
colorectal carcinoma, but the significance in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC)
(T3-4/N+) following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neo-CRT) and surgery is
unclear. Since adjuvant chemotherapy showed no benefit for LARC following neo-CRT,
it is of great value to investigate whether TDs can identify the subgroup of patients
who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: Between 2004 and 2012, 310 LARC patients following neo-CRT and
surgery were retrospectively reviewed. Overall survival (OS), disease-free survival
(DFS), distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) and local recurrence free survival
(LRFS) were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test and Cox models.
Results: TDs-positive patients showed adverse OS, DFS and DMFS (all P≤0.001),
but not LRFS (P = 0.273). In multivariate analysis, TDs continued to be associated
with poor OS (HR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.32-4.4, P = 0.004) and DFS (HR = 1.99, 95%
CI 1.21-3.27, P = 0.007), but not DMFS (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 0.97-3.20, P = 0.061)
or LRFS (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 0.58-5.85, P = 0.298). Among TDs-positive patients,
adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improved OS (P = 0.045) and DMFS (P = 0.026),
but not DFS (P = 0.127) or LRFS (P = 0.862).
Conclusions: TDs are predictive of poor survival in LARC after neo-CRT.
Fortunately, TDs-positive patients appear to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.

[2, 4, 5]. Adjuvant chemotherapy was assumed to prevent
distant metastases. Unfortunately, the most recent metaanalysis demonstrated that adjuvant fluorouracil-based
chemotherapy does not improve overall survival (OS),
disease free survival (DFS) or distant metastasis free
survival (DMFS) of LARC following neo-CRT and TME
[6]. Certain subgroups of patients are likely to benefit
from adjuvant chemotherapy considering the tumor
heterogeneity and divergent response to neo-CRT. Thus
it is important to identify groups of patients who would
benefit from adjuvant treatment after neo-CRT from those
who would not.
Tumor deposits are found in the perirectal and
mesenteric adipose tissue around rectal adenocarcinomas.
Several editions of American Joint Committee on Cancer
(AJCC) staging manual have defined tumor deposits.
The current seventh edition classifies tumor deposits as
follows: the deposit should be in the pericolorectal fat or
adjacent mesocolic fat, it should be away from the leading
edge of the tumor, there should be no evidence of residual
lymph node tissue, and finally the tumor deposit should be
within the lymph drainage area of the primary carcinoma.
Previously, several studies [7-10] had reported that
tumor deposits were associated with decreased DFS and
may identify patients with more aggressive tumors who
need aggressive treatment. However, patients recruited in
these studies [7-10] did not receive neo-CRT, and tumor
deposits were defined and evaluated according to the
old criteria which were quite different from the updated
standard. The study by Goldstein et al. [9] restricted to
patients with T3N+M0 colon adenocarcinomas, which
might limit the extensive application of its findings.
Moreover, the study by Belt et al. [11] found that tumor
deposits defined by the sixth edition criteria increased
the risk of developing recurrence in node-negative
colorectal cancer patients. Similarly, a recent study [12]
also found tumor deposits to be poor prognostic markers
among rectal adenocarcinoma patients using the seventh
edition criteria. Contradictorily, Song et al. [13] reported
that tumor deposits were not prognostic in rectal cancer,
and the category N1c in the seventh edition of the AJCC
staging system defined by tumor deposits may not be
appropriate for patients receiving preoperative neo-CRT.
Thus the role of tumor deposits remained controversial
in the current treatment mode of neo-CRT followed by
TME. More importantly, none of these studies [7-13]
investigated the association between tumor deposits and
adjuvant chemotherapy.
Therefore, we included 310 LARC patients treated
with neo-CRT and TME, to investigate the prognostic
effect of tumor deposits and the association with
postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy.

Patients
This retrospective study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Sun Yat-sen University
Cancer Center, and individual informed consent was
waived given the anonymous analysis of routine data. A
total of 376 patients undergoing neo-CRT followed by
radical surgery at our center between Oct. 2004 and Dec.
2012 were identified. Rectal carcinoma was clinically
diagnosed based on abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
and endorectal ultrasound (ERUS). Other examinations
such as complete blood cell count, liver function tests and
serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and carbohydrate
antigen 19-9 [CA19-9] levels were also conducted. All
patients had biopsy-proven rectal carcinoma.

Pathological review
After excluding 21 patients with synchronous distant
metastases, another primary malignancy or a prior history
of radiotherapy to the pelvis, only 355 patients were
eligible. Of these, another 15 resection specimens were
missed. In the remaining 340 specimens, 30 specimens
were excluded because of the bad stain and quality.
Finally, a total of 310 specimens stained with hematoxylin and eosin could be used to determine the tumor
deposits for the first round by an experienced pathologist
(SYX) and the second round by another pathologist
(HZZ). They were blinded to the patients’ clinical data
and existing pathological outcomes. Tumor deposits were
defined and evaluated based on the seventh edition of the
AJCC staging manual (Figure 1). Furthermore, tumor
regression grading (TRG) classification was evaluated by
both pathologists together according to the current AJCC
criteria (TRG 0, no residual tumor cells; TRG 1, single
cells or small groups of cells; TRG 2, residual cancer with
desmoplastic response; and TRG 3, minimal evidence of
tumor response).

Treatment
Radiotherapy was delivered to the whole pelvis
at a dose of 46 Gy in 23 fractions, followed by a 4-Gy
boost delivered to the primary tumor in 2 fractions for 5
weeks. The radiotherapy technique was based on a threedimensional conformal radiotherapy treatment planning
system (PINNACLE 8) using a 3-field irradiation plan (an
8-MV photon posterior-anterior field and 15-MV photonopposed lateral beams). The clinical target volume (CTV)
included the primary rectal tumor, perirectal tissues,
6336

Oncotarget

presacral lymph nodes, internal iliac lymph nodes and
obturator lymph nodes. For patients with stage T4 cancer
or tumors invading the bladder, CTV also included the
external iliac lymph drainage area. The superior border
of CTV was the bottom of L5, and the inferior border
was 2.5-3 cm distal to the tumor. The anterior border
was the posterior margin of the bladder or uterus and the
posterior border was the anterior margin of the sacrum.
The planning target volume (PTV) is defined as the CTV+
8~10 mm.
The main preoperative concurrent chemotherapeutic
regimens were capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX) or
5-FU, folinic acid and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX6). A total of
259 patients received XELOX (oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2,
d1+ capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 bid, po, d1-14); 42 patients
were administered FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2,
d1+ leucovorin 400 mg/m2, d1+ 5-FU 400 mg/m2 iv, d1
followed by 2400 mg/m2 civ 46-48 h); the remaining nine
patients received only Xeloda (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2
bid, po, d1-14) due to poor liver or kidney function.
Surgery was performed 6-8 weeks after the
completion of preoperative CRT. All patients underwent
radical proctectomy, including low anterior resection
(LAR), abdominoperineal resection (APR) and
Hartmann’s procedure.
Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was
recommended for all patients, irrespective of the surgical
pathological results, in accordance with National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines.
However, only 223 patients actually received adjuvant
chemotherapy, either XELOX or FOLFOX6, 4 weeks
after surgery. The other 87 patients received no adjuvant
chemotherapy owing to postoperative complications, poor
overall performance status or economical problem.

secondary endpoints were DMFS and local recurrence free
survival (LRFS). Distant metastasis was identified as any
recurrence outside of the pelvic cavity. Local recurrence
was defined as any recurrence within the pelvic cavity or
perineum.
The balance of covariates among the tumor deposits
groups was examined using t tests (continuous variables),
χ2 tests or Fisher’s exact tests (categorical variables),
as appropriate. OS, DFS, DMFS and LRFS rates were
estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and the logrank test. Multivariate analysis was performed using the
Cox proportional hazards regression. Two-sided P < 0.05
was considered statistically significant. All statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS software, version 20

RESULTS
Patients
The baseline characteristics of the 310 patients were
listed in Table 1. Based on ERUS and/or MRI, 27% of
patients were diagnosed with clinical stage II disease,
and 73% were diagnosed with clinical stage III disease.
A total of 75 patients (24%) had a pathological complete
response (pCR, ypT0N0M0). The median time interval
between CRT completion and surgery was 48 days (range;
20 to 84 days). A total of 186 patients (60%) underwent
LAR, 110 (35%) underwent APR, and 14 (5%) underwent
Hartmann’s procedure. The median follow up was 42
months (range, 5 to 126 months). There were 14 cases
(4.5%) of locoregional relapse, 66 cases (21%) of distant
metastasis and 62 cases (20%) of death, respectively. Six
patients (2%) had both locoregional relapse and distant
metastasis. The 3- and 5-year OS rates were 86.7% and
77.2%, and the 3- and 5-year DFS rates were 73.3% and
65.9%, respectively (Table 1).

Follow up
Follow up was performed every 3 months for the
first 2 years after whole treatment and every 6 months
thereafter. Evaluations included complete blood cell count,
liver function tests, serum CEA and CA19-9 level tests,
physical examination and digital rectal examination at
each visit. Chest radiography, abdominal and pelvic CT
scanning and colonoscopy were conducted every 6 months
after surgery. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT
is not regularly recommended. The last follow up was
completed in May 2015.

Association
between
tumor
deposits
and
pretreatment
and
postoperative
clinicopathological factors
Overall, elevated pretreatment CEA levels was
strongly associated with positive tumor deposits (P =
.022). Furthermore, postoperative factors, including
ypT (P < .001) and AJCC-TRG (P < .001), were also
significantly correlated with tumor deposits. (Table 2).

Statistical analysis

Prognostic effect of tumor deposits in OS and DFS

The primary endpoints were OS and DFS, which
were defined as the time from completion of the whole
treatment to death from any cause and to the first
occurrence of either local or distant progression or of
death in the absence of such an event, respectively. The

Perirectal tumor deposits were detected in 54 of 310
patients (17.4%). In univariate analysis, tumor deposits
positive was significantly associated with poor OS (3-year

2A-2C, Table 1).
In addition, we examined the prognostic significance
of various clinical and pathological factors. Age (P =
0.028), CA19-9 levels (P = 0.003), T staging after CRT
(ypT) (P = 0.004), positive lymph nodes after CRT (ypN)
(P < 0.001), TRG (P = 0.036) and postoperative adjuvant
chemotherapy (P = 0.026) were all significantly associated
with OS. DFS was significantly associated with CA19-9
levels (P = .001), ypT (P < .001), ypN (P < .001) and
pCR (P = .040). CA-199 levels (P = .039), cN (P = .026),
clinical stage (P = .019), ypT (P < .001), ypN (P < .001),
pCR (P = .005) and TRG (P = .020) were all significantly
associated with DMFS. LRFS was marginally correlated
with ypN (P = .063) (Table 1).
Adjusting for the above significant covariants in
the multivariate analysis, tumor deposits continued to be
significantly associated with poor OS (HR = 2.44, 95%
CI 1.32-4.48; P = 0.004) and DFS (HR = 1.99, 95% CI
1.21-3.27; P = 0.007). However, tumor deposits did not
correlate with DMFS (HR = 1.77, 95% CI 0.97-3.20; P =
0.061) or LRFS (HR = 1.85, 95% CI 0.58-5.85; P = 0.298)
(Table 3).

In tumor deposits-positive group, adjuvant
chemotherapy improved OS (3-year rates 72.6% vs
52.9%, P = 0.045) and DMFS (72.9% vs 38.8%, P =
0.026) (Figure 3), but not DFS (P = 0.127) or LRFS (P =
0.862). In tumor deposits-negative group, there were no
significant differences between with and without adjuvant
chemotherapy in OS (91.4% vs 90.5%, P = 0.213), DFS
(77.5% vs 82.7%, P = 0.847), DMFS (81.6% vs 90.4%, P
= 0.065) or LRFS (97% vs 94.4%, P = 0.073).

DISCUSSION
In our study, elevated CEA level, advanced ypT
and higher AJCC-TRG were associated with tumor
deposits in LARC following neo-CRT and TME. Tumor
deposits positive patients had poorer OS, DFS and
DMFS. Fortunately, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy
appeared to improve the survival of this subgroup of
patients.
It is known that elevated CEA level [14], advanced
ypT [15] and higher TRG [16] correlate with large tumor

neo-CRT had a TRG of 2 or 3 (minimal or no response)
but no TRG of 0 (no viable cancer cells) [12], thus it was
not unusual that tumor deposits positive patients in our
study had significantly higher pretreatment CEA level,
more advanced ypT and higher TRG than those negative
ones.
Consistent with prior studies [7-12], we also found
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that patients with tumor deposits had poorer OS, DFS and
DMFS. Importantly, our study had the largest cohort of
310 patients with neo-CRT, using the latest evaluation and
definition criteria of tumor deposits. Inversely, Song et al.
[13] reviewed 136 ypT3N0M0 rectal cancer, and indicated
that tumor deposits showed no prognostic significance.
Obviously, the small sample size of this study may lower
the confidence of the findings. Given the poor prognostic

the role of adjuvant chemotherapy in the according strata.
Interestingly, subgroup analysis showed that in tumor
deposits-positive group, adjuvant chemotherapy improved
OS and DMFS.
The pathogenesis and mechanism of the role of
tumor deposits in rectal cancer is unclear at present.
Firstly, one pattern of tumor deposits was characterized by
microscopic clusters of undifferentiated cancer cells in the
fatty tissues, which were morphologically similar to the
tumor budding at the invasive front of the main tumor (the
socalled peri-tumoral budding) [7]. Researches indicated
that peri-tumoral budding was strongly associated with
lymphatic invasion and lymph nodes metastasis [17, 18].
And numerious studies [19-24] had confirmed the poor
prognostic effect of peri-tumoral budding in colorectal
cancer. As tumor budding indicates the early phase of
invasion, tumor deposits may represent more vigorous
tumor progression. Thus it is reasonable to observe a
similar poor prognostic of tumor deposits in our study.
Secondly, tumor deposits may acted as satellites of the
main tumor to increase the field of invasion, as tumor
deposits may be lymph nodes completely replaced by
tumor according to AJCC Manual for staging of cancer.
In addition, Prabhudesai et al. [10] found a significant
association between tumor deposits and vascular invasion,
which suggested that a proportion of tumor deposits may
represent blood-borne spread and that tumor deposits
were early form of metastatic disease in patients with
rectal cancer. These highly supported tumor deposits
to be a poor prognostic factor as we found. Especially,
tumor deposits positive patients were mostly found to be
those with advanced ypT stage in the current study. Thus
the subgroup of tumor deposits positive patients were
very likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, since
adjuvant chemotherapy could not improve the survival
of ypT0-2N0 patients but significantly decreased the
risk of distant metastasis in ypT3-4N0 patients [25]. And
due to the strong association of positive tumor deposits
with elevated CEA level and higher AJCC-TRG, besides
advanced ypT stage, tumor deposits positive patients
after neo-CRT may be a subgroup with poorer prognosis

than ypT3-4N0 alone, and consequently obtained more
benefit in DMFS and OS from the additional adjuvant
chemotherapy.
Of note, Rogers et al. [26] indicated that
pretreatment intra-tumoral budding in the rectal biopsies
predicted a poor pathological response to neo-CRT. But
importantly, tumor budding within the entire tumor is
termed intra-tumoral budding [27], which was not the
same as the peri-tumoral budding after neo-CRT in our
study. The finding in that study by Rogers et al. [26]
cannot indicate a similarly poor response to adjuvant
chemotherapy after surgery for patients with tumor
deposits or peri-tumoral budding in resected specimens.
Similarly, in the study by Kim et al. [28], tumor buddingpositivity was found to be a significant predictor of poor
survival in patients receiving non-oxaliplatin-based
adjuvant chemotherapy. But the prognostic impact did
not remain in multivariate analysis on one hand; on the
other hand, this cannot suggest the absence of benefit
from adjuvant chemotherapy in tumor budding (deposits)
positive patients.
The main limitation of this study is that the two
pathologists did not evaluate the resection specimens
independently, which may increase the error of evaluating
tumor deposits. And the possibility of confounders and
issues with missing data are unavoidable due to the
retrospective design. But clinicopathologic and survival
data were veriﬁed by review of individual patient record.
All included patients received standard management of
neoadjuvant chemotherapy and TME as recommended.
Overall, this study indicated tumor deposits
following neo-CRT to be poor prognostic factors, and
found survival benefit from postoperative adjuvant
chemotherapy in LARC patients with tumor deposits.
