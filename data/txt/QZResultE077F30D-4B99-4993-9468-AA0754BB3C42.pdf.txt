ABSTRACT
Maternal embryonic leucine-zipper kinase (MELK), which was reported to
be frequently up-regulated in various types of solid cancer, plays critical roles in
formation and maintenance of cancer stem cells. However, little is known about the
relevance of this kinase in hematologic malignancies. Here we report characterization
of possible roles of MELK in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). MELK is expressed in
AML cell lines and AML blasts with higher levels in less differentiated cells. MELK is
frequently upregulated in AML with complex karyotypes and is associated with worse
clinical outcome. MELK knockdown resulted in growth inhibition and apoptosis of
leukemic cells. Hence, we investigated the potent anti-leukemia activity of OTS167, a
small molecule MELK kinase inhibitor, in AML, and found that the compound induced
cell differentiation and apoptosis as well as decreased migration of AML cells. MELK
expression was positively correlated with the expression of FOXM1 as well as its
downstream target genes. Furthermore, MELK inhibition resulted in downregulation
of FOXM1 activity and the expression of its downstream targets. Taken together,
and given that OTS167 is undergoing a phase I clinical trial in solid cancer, our study
warrants clinical evaluation of this compound as a novel targeted therapy for AML
patients.

INTRODUCTION

7]. Moreover, high levels of MELK expression correlated
with poorly differentiated histological types of brain
tumor and prostate cancer [8-10], and is associated with
poor prognosis of patients with breast cancer [11]. Several
studies have shown that down-regulation of MELK by
treatment with siRNA significantly induced apoptosis in
breast cancer cells and various types of brain tumor [3,
6]. Additionally, MELK was identified as one of the genes
commonly expressed in undifferentiated cancer cells
which may suggest a possible role for MELK in cancer
stem cell maintenance and survival [12].
MELK also contributes to cell cycle progression

MELK (maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase)
also known as MPK38 is a cell-cycle dependent protein
kinase that belongs to the AMP-activated Ser/Thr protein
kinase family [1, 2]. In normal adult tissues, MELK
mRNA expression was hardly detectable except in testis
and at very low levels in the thymus and small intestine
[3, 4]. In addition, MELK was reported to be expressed in
neural progenitors and hematopoietic stem cells [5].
MELK was found to be up-regulated in various types
of cancer including breast cancer [3] and glioblastoma [6,

and proliferation, likely through phosphorylation of
CDC25b [7, 13]. MELK was found to be activated
by autophosphorylation [14], however, it is not clear
what triggers this self-activation and whether a specific
substrate binding is required for autophosphorylation.
Several substrates for MELK have been reported; for
example, in glioblastoma stem cells, MELK was found
to phosphorylate FOXM1, a crucial transcription factor
and a master regulator of mitosis in cancer stem cells
[15]. FOXM1 and its targets such as Cyclin B1 have been
implicated in promoting proliferation through modulating
cell cycle progression in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
[16]. Therefore, it is plausible that targeting MELK in AML
may affect cell proliferation and cell cycle progression,
and thus may provide a therapeutic advantage. MELK was
reported to be expressed in hematopoietic cells [4], and
likely to be involved in hematopoiesis as demonstrated
in a zebra fish model [17]. However, the expression and
the function of MELK in hematological malignancies
have not yet been characterized. AML is a clonal disease
derived from the hematopoietic stem cells; therefore
similar to glioblastoma stem cells, we speculated that
MELK-dependent mechanisms might play an important
role in leukemia stem-cell survival and proliferation. Here
we aimed to characterize the expression of MELK in AML
and examine possible biological roles of this gene in the
pathogenesis of this disease. We demonstrate that MELK
is expressed in AML cell lines and in AML primary blasts
and that the expression of this gene is significantly higher
in the stem cell-enriched population of blast cells obtained
from AML patients than that in the more differentiated cell
population. Targeting MELK expression with siRNA or
MELK kinase activity with a small molecule inhibitor
(OTS167) [18, 19] resulted in significant growth inhibition
of AML cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate the effect of
MELK inhibition on FOXM1 and its downstream targets.
Importantly, OTS167 induced myeloid differentiation and
apoptosis and also decreased cell migration. Our study
suggests that MELK is potentially an important novel
therapeutic target in AML and clinical development of
OTS167 in AML warrants consideration.

(Wilcoxon’s P <0.0001), t(6,9) and del(5q)/-5 (Wilcoxon’s
P < 0.05), were found to have relatively higher levels of
MELK expression than other subsets (Figure 1A). Survival
analyses were performed in a cohort (n=519 patients)
restricted to patients with available data on survival and
cytogenetics, and patients with t(15;17) (i.e. APL patients)
were excluded due to different biology and treatment.
Considering MELK expression as a continuous variable,
patients expressing higher levels of MELK transcript
revealed significantly shorter event-free survival (EFS;
3.8 vs 6.5 months; P = 0.02) and shorter overall survival
(OS; 11.2 vs 12.9; P = 0.04). When patients were classified
according to quartiles of MELK expression, those in the
highest quartile had shorter OS and EFS (Log-rank test,
P=0.005, both; for the comparison across all 4 groups)
(Figure 1B and C) and lower complete remission rate
(Fisher exact test, P = 0.03).

MELK expression in AML cell lines and primary
blast cells
We assessed MELK mRNA expression by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in 11 AML cell
lines representative of the different cytogenetic and
molecular subsets of the disease. MELK transcript was
expressed at variable levels in all AML cell lines (Figure
2A). MELK protein was also detected in all AML cell
lines but was not well correlated with its transcript
level, suggesting the presence of some mechanisms that
may regulate its translation and the protein stability.
Importantly, we observed several isoforms of MELK
protein expressed at different levels among the different
AML cell lines (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we examined
MELK expression in primary blasts obtained from eight
patients with AML by qRT-PCR, and compared it with
that in monocytes obtained from three healthy donors;
we found MELK expression to be significantly higher
in AML blasts compared to that in monocytes (P = 0.01;
Figure 2C). Additionally, we measured MELK protein
level in nine AML patients by western blot analysis, and
found MELK to be expressed in all the samples examined.
MELK protein was also detected in normal mobilized
CD34+ cells obtained from a healthy donor (Figure 2D,
shows five representative patient samples).
Interestingly, MELK transcript and protein were
observed at higher levels in CD34+ cells than CD34- cells
isolated from AML blasts, measured by qRT-PCR and
western blot analyses, respectively (Figure 2E,F).

three cell lines transfected with MELK-siRNA showed
significant decrease in cell viability compared with those
transfected with control-siRNA (P < 0.05 for all of the
three cell lines) (Figure 3C). These results were also

validated in MV4-11 cells using two other siRNAs against
MELK (Figure S1). Furthermore, cells transfected with
MELK-siRNA exhibited significant increase in apoptosis
(~35%, P = 0.03) when compared with cells transfected
with control-siRNA by the measurement of Annexin and
PI staining (Figure 3D).

of OTS167 revealed 30-40% increase in the apoptotic
population at 48 hours and 70-80% (P ≤ 0.001) at 72

48 hours and 20-75% (P ≤ 0.01) at 72 hours post treatment

We utilized a recently developed and very potent
MELK inhibitor OTS167 (IC50 = 0.41 nM) [18] and

the apoptosis-inducible activity of this compound (Figure
4C). Importantly, increase in myeloid differentiation was
observed in U937 cells treated with 50nM of OTS167
compared with untreated cells when assessed by CD11b
staining (P = 0.04; Figure 4D). In addition, pretreatment
with 100nM of OTS167 for 6 hours inhibited the migration
of THP-1 cells towards the chemoattractant agent SDF-1,
as evident by the decrease in the number of migrated cells
(Figure 4E and S2). No significant increase in apoptosis
was observed in these cells at 12 hours following
treatment, suggesting that the effect on migration is not
due to the increase in cell death (Figure S3).
Additionally, cell cycle analysis performed in MV411 and THP-1 cells showed that treatment with 50nM of
OTS167 resulted in significant decrease in the percentage
of cells in G0-G1 phase (OTS167 vs untreated; 47% vs
55%; P = 0.02, and 28% vs 43% P = 0.006 in MV4-11 and
THP-1 cells, respectively). We also observed an increase
in the percentage of cells in the S phase (OTS167 vs
untreated; 38% vs 31%; P = 0.05, and 42% vs 28% P =

0.002 in MV4-11 and THP-1 cells, respectively; Figure 4F
shows a representative experiment out of three performed)
suggesting possible inhibition in the process of the S to
G2-M transition; under these conditions, apoptosis was
assessed to confirm that this effect was not due to increase
in apoptosis (Figure S4).

Growth suppressive effect of MELK inhibitor
OTS167 on MLL-AF9 mouse cells and AML
primary blasts
To confirm the growth-inhibitory activity of OTS167
in AML, we used a cell line in which the human MLLAF9 oncogene was introduced into mouse hematopoietic
cells. The viability of MLL-AF9 cells was dramatically
affected by OTS167 in a time- and dose-dependent manner
as shown in Figure 5A. In addition, the exposure of this
cell line to 25 and 50nM of OTS167 resulted in a 57%
and 74% increase in apoptotic cell death, respectively,
assessed by Annexin and PI staining (P = 0.001 for each;

To further validate our findings, we treated blasts
obtained from four different patients with AML with
various doses of OTS167 (Figure 6A) and found the IC50
values for these cells were 18.5, 37.7, 8.9, and 31.8nM.
In addition, we assessed apoptosis by flow cytometry of
blasts obtained from four patients with AML and observed
~20% increase in apoptosis when cells were treated with

50nM of OTS167 (P = 0.04; Figure 6B). Furthermore,
we observed potential differentiation of primary AML
blasts following the treatment with OTS167 as assessed
by CD11b staining (P = <0.001; Figure 6C). As shown
in Figure 6D, cell pellet color changed from white to red
following the treatment with OTS167. Moreover, 25nM of
OTS167 resulted in a significant decrease in the number
of colonies grown from blasts of a patient with AML as

have been implicated in promoting cell proliferation
through activating cell cycle progression in AML [16]. In
order to establish the rationale for a possible involvement
of MELK in the activity of FOXM1 in AML, we examined
whether a correlation between MELK expression and the
expression of FOXM1 or its downstream target genes
in AML patients exist. In the analyzed data set of adult
AML patients, we found that MELK expression was
strongly correlated with that of FOXM1 (Spearman’s rank
correlation is 0.75), CCNB1 (Spearman’s rank correlation
is 0.79), and BIRC5 (Spearman’s rank correlation is 0.70);
weaker correlation was found with CDC25B (Spearman’s

targeting MELK expression with siRNA and the other
targeting the MELK kinase activity with a small molecule
inhibitor, and examined the role of MELK in preclinical
AML models. Both approaches demonstrated a significant
anti-growth activity in AML cells including a dose- and
time- dependent increase in cell death as well as an
enhancement of myeloid differentiation in AML cell lines
and primary AML blasts.
The correlation between MELK expression and
FOXM1 expression in AML patients is consistent with the
previously reported association between the two proteins
in glioma cells [15] [22]. Although the role of MELK has
not been examined in AML, its substrate FOXM1 has been
shown to be upregulated in AML and possibly associated
with worse clinical outcome [23, 24]. Furthermore,
FOXM1 and its downstream target genes have been shown
to be involved in growth and proliferation of leukemic
cells [16].
In conclusion, given the high expression of MELK
and the pro-apoptotic effect of its inhibition, targeting
MELK may provide a new therapeutic approach. These
results suggest that further clinical evaluation of the small
molecule MELK inhibitor OTS167, which is currently
undergoing a phase I clinical trial in solid cancer, as a
novel targeted therapy for AML patients is warranted.

rank correlation is 0.46) (Figure 7A, B, C and D).
Therefore, we hypothesized that targeting MELK
in AML may result in inhibition of FOXM1 activity and
subsequent downregulation of FOXM1 target genes.
Indeed, MV4-11, THP-1, U937 and KG1 cells treated
with 100 nM of OTS167 for 12 hours showed a decrease
in phospho-FOXM1 (active form) and/or total FOXM1
(Figure 7E). Furthermore, the mRNA expression level of
CCNB1 and CDC25B levels were also decreased in MV411 and KG1 cells following 18 and 6 hours treatment with
100 nM of OTS167 (P <0.001) (Figure 7F). Cyclin B1
protein level was also decreased in AML cells transfected
with MELK-siRNA (Figure S5).

DISCUSSION
Elevated MELK expression has been reported in
a variety of solid tumors and has been associated with
a poor prognosis for cancer patients. To our knowledge,
MELK expression and activity have never previously
been examined in hematologic malignancies. According
to the TCGA database, MELK alteration (mutation,
deletion or amplification) was observed in the range of
1-8% of cases in various types of cancer. In AML, no
MELK mutation has been reported in the TCGA database,
but MELK transcription was up-regulated in 4% of the
cases. In this study we examined MELK expression in
AML cells from 559 patients with different molecular and
cytogenetic abnormalities. Though variable expression
levels were observed in the different subsets of AML,
MELK expression level was relatively higher in AML
with a complex karyotypes, t(6,9) and del(5q)/-5, all
of which are associated with chemotherapy-resistant
disease and inferior clinical outcome. This observation
was consistent with our finding that AML patients with
higher MELK expression revealed shorter EFS and OS
than those with lower MELK expression. This finding
is also consistent with the negative prognostic value of
elevated MELK expression in breast and prostate cancers,
and glioblastoma [3, 8, 10, 21].
In this study, we also analyzed MELK expression
at the RNA and protein levels in several AML cell lines
and in primary blasts from patients with AML. Consistent
with previous studies showing MELK to be expressed
in the stem-cell enriched glioblastoma cells (CD133
positive cancer cells) [9], we found significantly higher
MELK expression in the less differentiated leukemic cell
population (enriched for CD34+ cells) than in the more
differentiated cell population (CD34- cells), implying a
possible role of the MELK gene in stem cell maintenance.
Indeed, targeting MELK with a small molecule inhibitor,
OTS167, resulted in a significant decrease in colony
formation and migration of AML cells. Thus, we suggest
that MELK could be a potential target for the treatment of
AML.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Analysis of publically available gene expression
data sets
To analyze the differential expression of MELK in
AML subgroups, we used the publically available gene
expression data set GSE37642. All patients of this cohort
were treated on AMLCG protocols. The clinical and
molecular characteristics of these patients were previously
reported (GSE37642) [20].

Cell Lines and Primary Blasts for in vitro
experiments
AML cell lines (ATCC, Manassas, VA), ATCC
performs cell line characterizations using short tandem
repeat (STR). Cells were passaged in our laboratory for
fewer than 6 months after receipt. Cells were cultured in
RPMI medium supplemented with 10-20% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY).
Blast cells from AML patients were maintained in RPMI
medium supplemented with 20% FBS, and 1x StemSpan
CC100 (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada).
AML blast cells used in the experiments were obtained
by apheresis of blood or bone marrow samples collected
from patients treated at the University of Chicago (U
of C) and stored in the U of C Leukemia Tissue Bank.

all colonies per well. For viability analysis, MTT assay
was performed in a 96-well plate and 5x104 cells were
plated per well. Cell counting kit-8 (Dojindo Molecular
Technologies, Inc., Kumamoto, Japan) was used for MTT
reaction.
For viability and apoptosis analyses, cells were
collected, spun down then washed with PBS and
resuspended in 50 μl binding buffer containing 2 μL
of Annexin V (eBioscience, San Diego, CA), and 5
μL propidium iodide (PI) (eBioscience). After 20 min
incubation, fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry
on a FACSCalibur instrument [26].

Reagents
siRNA sequence targeting MELK was as follows:
MELK siRNA#1 (UGCAGCUAGAUAGGAUGUC),
siRNA#2 (CCAUGUGCUAGAGACAGCCAACAAA)
[25] and siRNA#3 (CUGGAUCAUGCAAGAUUACAA)
[25] that were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO). OTS167 was provided by Oncotherapy Science
(Kawasaki, Japan).

Migration assay

Transient Transfection, RNA Interference

Migration assays were performed in transwell plates
(Costar, Cambridge, MA) of 6.5-mm diameter with 5-μm
pore filters as previously described [28]. Approximately
100,000 AML cells in 0.1 mL RPMI with 10% FBS were
added to the upper compartment, and 0.6 mL of the same
medium including SDF-1a (400nM final concentration)
was added to the lower compartment. SDF-1α was
purchased from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ). Transwell
plates were incubated at 37°C in the condition of 5% CO2
for 4 hours. Cells in the bottom well (migrated cells) were
then imaged under the microscope.

Transient transfection of cells was performed
utilizing 1 nmol of siRNA and 100 ul Gene Pulser buffer
per reaction, and the cells were electroporated using
the Bio-Rad Gene Pulse Xcell (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA) or Amaxa Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, Basel
Switzerland ) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

RNA Extraction, RNA Expression Quantification
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent
(Life Technologies). MELK mRNA expression in AML
cells was measured by ViiA 7 system according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Each cDNA was synthesized
using SuperScript III reagents (Life Technologies)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Quantitative
Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was performed using
commercially available TaqMan Gene Expression
Assay primers and probes with the ViiA 7 system (Life
Technologies). The expression levels were normalized to
18S rRNA, ABL gene or B2M gene.

Immunofluorescent Staining, Flow Cytometry
Cells were washed with PBS, spun down and stained
with CD11b antibodies (eBioscience, San Diego, CA) with
20-min incubation at room temperature; cells were then
washed with PBS and resuspended in PBS. Fluorescence
was quantified by flow cytometry on a FACSCalibur
instrument [29].

Cell Cycle Analysis

Western Blot Analysis and Antibodies

Cells were treated with 50nM of OTS167, 24 hours
later cells were incubated with Brdu for 45 minutes, then
collected, washed with PBS, fixed and stained according
to BD Pharmingen FITC Brdu Flow kit instruction (BD,
San Jose, CA). Samples were then analyzed by flow
cytometry on a FACSCalibur instrument

Western-blot analyses were performed as previously
described [26]. The following antibodies were used: mouse
monoclonal MELK antibody (Oncotherapy Science), and
rabbit polyclonal FOXM1 antibody (Santa Cruz, Dallas,
TX), mouse Cyclin B1 antibody (Santa Cruz), Caspase-3
and cleaved Caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA)
mouse monoclonal β-Actin (AC-15) (Sigma-Aldrich).

Statistical Analysis

Clonogenic and Viability Analyses

Definitions of clinical end points (event free survival
(EFS) and overall survival (OS)) are as previously reported
[30]. Wilcoxon test was used to compare MELK expression
of each cytogenetically abnormal subgroup to patients
with cytogenetically normal (CN-) AML (reference).The
differences in baseline clinical and molecular features
between the MELK higher and lower groups were tested

Methylcellulose clonogenic assays were carried
out by plating 2×104 primary blasts in 0.9% MethoCult
(StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) [27].
Colony numbers were scored 10 days later, by counting

using the Fisher’s exact and Wilcoxon rank sum tests
for categorical and continuous variables, respectively.
Estimated probabilities of EFS and OS were calculated
using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the log-rank test
was used for evaluation of differences between survival
distributions. Mechanistic and biological experiments
were analyzed with paired and unpaired two-sided t-tests.
P values < .05 were considered statistically significant.
Experiments were performed in triplicate (except for when
patient blasts were used, these experiment were done in
duplicate when possible), results were presented by Mean
± SE.
