BACKGROUND: Pralatrexate (PDX) is an inhibitor of dihydrofolate reductase that was rationally designed to improve cellular uptake
and retention of the drug. Preclinical data have shown synergy with the sequential administration of a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor followed 24 hours later by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). METHODS: Twenty-seven patients were enrolled at 1 of 5 PDX dose levels from 75
to 185 mg/m2 on day 1 followed 24 hours later by 5-FU at a dose of 3000 mg/m2/48 hours every 2 weeks with folic acid and vitamin
B12 supplementation. Baseline blood was collected for pharmacogenetic analysis of polymorphisms of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase. RESULTS: Mucositis was the most common dose-limiting toxicity. When the worst toxicities across
all cycles were considered, grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia were found to have occurred in 14.8%, 14.8%,
and 0% of patients, respectively. Grade 2 to 3 toxicities included mucositis (66.6%), dehydration (33.3%), fatigue (25.9%), and diarrhea (22.2%). Version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria was used to grade toxicities The median
progression-free survival (PFS) was 112 days (range, 28-588 days). Seven patients (26%) had a PFS of >180 days (5 patients with
colorectal cancer, 1 patient with pancreatic cancer, and 1 patient with non-small cell lung cancer). Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and thymidylate synthase did not correlate with toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The recommended dose of PDX was
148 mg/m2. A subset of heavily pretreated patients had PFS durations of 6 months with this regimen. Cancer 2015;121:3862-8.

INTRODUCTION
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and folate inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), including methotrexate (MTX), are
active in a variety of malignancies. There is strong preclinical evidence that the optimal sequence for combining DHFR
inhibitors with 5-FU involves pretreatment with the DHFR inhibitor followed by 5-FU.1-4 Administration of 5-FU followed by MTX is antagonistic in both in vitro and in vivo studies. The antipurine action of MTX is believed to result
from 2 factors: 1) partial depletion of 10-formyl-tetrahydrofolate, which is required for purine synthesis; and 2) buildup
of dihydrofolate, which is an inhibitor of de novo purine synthesis. Ongoing thymidylate synthesis is required to deplete
the cellular reduced-folate pool. Pretreatment with 5-FU inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS) thereby blocking the conversion of reduced folates to dihydrofolate. The reduced-folate pool is thus spared for purine synthesis, and the dihydrofolate pool does not expand. When MTX precedes 5-FU, ongoing thymidylate synthesis depletes reduced folates and
dihydrofolate pools accumulate, thus allowing blockade of purine biosynthesis. Inhibition of de novo purine synthesis
expands the intracellular pool of phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate, which is then available for the anabolism of 5-FU to
fluorouridine monophosphate by orotate phosphoribosyl transferase. Enhancement of 5-FU toxicity in some human
cancer cells is greatest when exposure to an antifolate DHFR inhibitor is maintained for 24 hours before the administration of 5-FU. One randomized trial performed among patients with colorectal cancer demonstrated that a 24-hour interval between MTX and 5-FU was superior to a 1-hour interval.5 A meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials comparing MTX
modulation of 5-FU with bolus 5-FU alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer documented a doubling of the
response rate with MTX modulation.6

Trial of Pralatrexate and 5-Fluorouracil/Grem et al

Pralatrexate (PDX) is a 10-deaza-aminopterin antifolate that was rationally designed to improve cellular
uptake and intracellular retention compared with MTX.713
It enters cancer cells via the reduced folate carrier
(RFC-1), which is overexpressed in cancer cells compared
with normal cells. PDX is a high-affinity substrate for
RFC-1, and it is more efficiently taken into cells at a rate
14 times greater than MTX. It is then polyglutamylated
by folylpolyglutamate synthetase. PDX has a much higher
affinity (10-fold) for folylpolyglutamate synthetase than
MTX. The addition of glutamate residues to PDX leads
to increased intracellular half-life and prolonged drug
action in malignant cells. In vitro studies have shown that
pretreatment with PDX for 24 hours before antimetabolites including gemcitabine, 5-FU, and 50 -deoxy-5fluorouridine is syngergistic.14,15
PDX (Fotolyn; Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, Irvine,
Calif) has been approved for the treatment of recurrent or
refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma on a schedule of
each week for 6 of 7 weeks at a dose of 30 mg/m2 with
vitamin B12 and folic acid supplementation.16,17 A much
higher dose intensity has been observed with an everyother-week schedule of PDX. The recommended phase 2
doses of single-agent PDX given every other week in trials
of patients with nonhematologic malignancies have
ranged from 150 mg/m2 to 190 mg/m2 with vitamin supplementation.13,18-20
The initial generation of trials evaluating either
MTX or trimetrexate with 5-FU used bolus 5-FU, which
is less effective compared with infusional schedules. An
every-other-week schedule of leucovorin-modulated
5-FU has been widely tested, and is reported to be well
tolerated.21-23 FOLFOX-6 involves oxaliplatin given with
leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg/m2 and bolus 5-FU at a
dose of 400 mg/m2, followed by a 46-hour infusion of 5FU at a dose of 2600 mg/m2.21 Modified FOLFOX-7
uses oxaliplatin with leucovorin at a dose of 400 mg/m2
followed by a 46-hour infusion of 5-FU at a dose of
3000 mg/m2.22 The results of a phase 1 trial of sequential
irinotecan given with leucovorin at a dose of 500 mg/m2
and 5-FU given as a 48-hour infusion recommended a 5FU dose of 3125 mg/m2.23 The current trial was designed
to determine the recommended dose of PDX given in
combination with infusional 5-FU. The starting dose of
PDX was 75 mg/m2 (one-half that of the most conservative recommended dose for patients with nonhematologic
malignancies given as a single agent with vitamin supplementation) given 24 hours before a fixed dose of 5-FU
given at a dose of 3000 mg/m2 intravenously over 48
hours every other week.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
This clinical trial was approved by the local Institutional
Review Board and in accordance with an assurance filed
with and approved by the US Department of Health and
Human Services. Informed consent was obtained from
each patient. Patients received oral folic acid at a dose of
1 mg daily starting 1 week before the initial dose of PDX
and vitamin B12 at a dose of 1 mg intramuscularly before
PDX and every 8 weeks thereafter to mitigate PDXassociated toxicities. Each cycle consisted of 4 weeks of
therapy with PDX given on days 1 and 15 and 5-FU infusion given over 48 hours starting on days 2 and 16
(24 hours after PDX). Dose escalation proceeded in 25%
increments of PDX until dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
during the initial cycle were noted in 2 of 3 to 6 patients at
a given level. Toxicity was assessed on days 1 and 15 of
each cycle. Version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute
Common Toxicity Criteria was used. A DLT occurring
during the initial 4-week cycle was defined as either an
absolute granulocyte nadir <500/mL, a platelet nadir
<25,000/mL, nonhematologic toxicities of grade 3, or
the need for a treatment delay of 2 weeks to permit resolution of treatment-related toxicity. Three patients were
enrolled at the initial dose level. The next group was enrolled after the first group had been observed for at least
4 weeks. If none of the 3 patients developed a DLT,
3 patients were enrolled at the next dose level. If 1 of the
3 patients had a DLT, up to 3 additional patients were enrolled at the same dose level. If none of these 3 patients
experienced a DLT, then escalation would proceed to the
next dose level. If 2 patients experienced a DLT, 3 patients
would be enrolled at 1 dose level below. The recommended phase 2 dose was that level at which no more
than 1 of 6 patients experienced a DLT. Filgrastim was
not used.
The dose of PDX was reduced first in the event of
mucositis and myelosuppression. If toxicities recurred despite a prior dose reduction in PDX, then the subsequent
dose of 5-FU was decreased by 20%. The dose of 5-FU
was reduced first for diarrhea. If diarrhea recurred despite
a prior 5-FU dose reduction, then the subsequent dose of
PDX was also decreased.
For the first 15 patients, the day 15 dose of PDX was
held for grade 2 mucositis but 5-FU was given at a 75%
dose. The protocol was then amended to hold both PDX
and 5-FU for grade 2 mucositis on day 15.
Eligibility criteria included patients with cancer who
had experienced disease progression while receiving standard therapy and who provided informed consent, and
who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group

performance status of 0 to 2, an absolute neutrophil count
of 1500/mL, a platelet count of 100,000/mL, a total
bilirubin of 1.5 mg/dL, and a serum creatinine less than
the upper limits of normal. To avoid potential delayed
clearance of PDX, the concomitant administration of
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and trimethoprim/
sulfamethoxazole were not allowed. The subsequent cycle
was initiated 28 days after the initiation of the prior cycle
provided that mucositis and diarrhea were grade 1, the
platelet count was 75,000/mL, and the absolute neutrophil count was 1500/mL. Treatment was delayed for up
to 2 weeks to allow resolution of treatment-related toxicities to the above parameters. If treatment could not
resume after a 2-week delay due to persistent treatmentrelated toxicities, protocol therapy was discontinued. If
both PDX and 5-FU were held mid-cycle (day 15), therapy resumed no sooner than 7 days later provided that the
criteria for the reinitiation of therapy were met as outlined
above. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the
interval from day 1 of therapy until the first notation of
clinical disease progression. Restaging scans were obtained
every 2 cycles or sooner if clinically indicated.
Blood samples were obtained before the first dose of
protocol therapy to analyze for common polymorphisms
in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and
TS. Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy coat samples
using the protocol from the FlexiGene DNA Kit Handbook (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif). Analysis of the number of
28-base pair (bp) tandem repeats in the TS promoter
region was performed as follows23: forward primer: 50 ACA-CCC-gTg-gCT-CCT-gCg-TTT-CC-30 ;
reverse
0
primer: 5 -CAg-CTC-CgA-gCC-ggC-CAC-Agg-CAT-g30 . Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using
the Advantage GC Genomic DNA Kit (Clontech Laboratories Inc, Mountain View, Calif). The PCR products
were separated on a 3% Tris-borate-ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (TBE)-low melting point agarose mini-gel
and electrophoresed at 60 V for 3 hours at 48C. After ethidium bromide staining of the gel, the number of tandem
repeats was determined by visualization of the size of the
amplified DNA fragments. DNA homozygous for 2R/2R
appears as a single band of approximately 220 bp in size,
DNA homozygous for 3R/3R appears as a single band of
approximately 250 bp in size, and DNA heterozygous for
2R/3R appears as 2 bands.
MTHFR genotypes at C677T and A1298C sites
were analyzed by PCR-based restriction fragment length
polymorphism methods as described previously.24,25
Briefly, the PCR primers for the C677T site were 677F
(50 -TgA-Agg-AgA-Agg-TgT-CTg-Cgg-gA-30 ) and 677R
3864

(50 -Agg-ACg-gTg-Cgg-TgA-gAg-Tg-30 ), which produce
a 198-bp fragment. The primers for the A1298C site were
1298F (50 -CTT-Tgg-ggA-gCT-gAg-gAC-TAC-TAC-30 )
and 1298R (50 -CAC-TTT-gTg-ACC-ATT-CCg-gTTTg-30 ), which generate a 163-bp fragment. These fragments were amplified separately but under the same conditions, as follows: a 25-mL reaction mixture consisted of
approximately 100 ng of template DNA, 0.5 uM of each
primer, 0.2 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate,
1.5 mM of MgCl2, and 1.2 units of Taq DNA polymerase
with 1X Reaction Buffer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh,
Pa). The PCR profile consisted of an initial melting step
of 2 minutes at 948C followed by 35 cycles of 30 seconds
at 948C, 30 seconds at 618C, and 30 seconds at 728C; and
a final elongation step of 7 minutes at 728C. The restriction enzymes HinfI and MboII (New England Biolabs
Inc, Beverly, Mass) were used to distinguish the C677T
and A1298C polymorphisms, respectively. Restriction
digestion was performed for 6 hours at 378C. The PCR
products were separated on a 3% TBE-agarose mini-gel
and electrophoresed at 60 V for 3 hr. The 677CC wildtype homozygotes were identified by the presence of only
a 198-bp fragment; 677CT heterozygotes were identified
by the presence of 198-bp, 175-bp, and 23-bp fragments;
and 677TT homozygotes were identified by the presence
of 175-bp and 23-bp fragments. The 1298AA wild-type
homozygotes produce 5 fragments of 56 bp, 31 bp, 30 bp,
28 bp, and 18 bp; 1298AC heterozygotes produce 6 fragments of 84 bp, 56 bp, 31 bp, 30 bp, 28 bp, and 18 bp;
and 1298CC homozygous variants produce 4 fragments
of 84 bp, 31 bp, 30 bp, and 18 bp.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Twenty-nine patients provided written informed consent.
One patient became ineligible due to an elevated bilirubin
level 1 week after the initiation of folic acid and did not
receive the study drug. Another patient changed her mind
before initiating folic acid. Twenty-seven patients received at
least 1 cycle of therapy and were evaluable for toxicity. The
demographics and baseline laboratory studies are presented
in Table 1. The majority of patients had adenocarcinomas
arising in the gastrointestinal tract and had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. The
median number of prior chemotherapy regimens was 3
(range, 2-8 regimens). Four patients were current smokers.
Clinical Toxicity

None of 3 patients entered at a PDX dose of 75 mg/m2
experienced a DLT during the first cycle (Table 2). One

of 3 patients entered at the dose of 94 mg/m2 experienced
grade 3 mucositis after the day 15 dose of PDX; 3 additional patients were entered at this dose level, but none
developed a DLT. One of 3 patients enrolled at the dose
of 118 mg/m2 did not receive the day 15 dose of PDX for
grade 2 mucositis but did receive 5-FU. She then developed pulmonary embolus and anemia (each grade 4).
Therefore, 3 additional patients were enrolled, but none
experienced a DLT. One of 3 patients enrolled at the dose
of 148 mg/m2 had grade 3 mucositis after the day 15 dose
of PDX, but 3 more patients did not develop a DLT. One
of 3 patients receiving the dose of 185 mg/m2 had grade
3 mucositis when evaluated before the day 15 dose of
PDX, and a second patient also required dose delay due to

the presence of grade 2 mucositis on day 15. One of
3 additional patients entered at this dose also developed
grade 3 mucositis before the day 15 dose of PDX. Therefore, the recommended phase 2 dose of PDX was 148 mg/
m2 given on day 1 with 5-FU at a dose of 3000 mg/m2
given as a 48-hour infusion starting on day 2.
When the worst toxicities across all cycles was considered, grade 3 to 4 neutropenia and anemia occurred in
14.8% and 14.8%, respectively, while no patient had
grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia (Table 3). Mucositis was
the most common toxicity reported. Grade 2 to 3 mucositis and diarrhea occurred in 66.6% and 22.2% of patients,
respectively, whereas grade 2 to 3 dehydration and fatigue
occurred in 33.3% and 25.9% of patients, respectively.

The median number of cycles administered was 4 (range,
1-15 cycles). Eighteen patients had stable disease (67%),
whereas 9 patients were found to have disease progression
at the time of initial restaging at 8 weeks. The median PFS
was 112 days (range, 28-588 days). Seven patients (26%)
had a PFS of >180 days (5 with colorectal cancer, 1 with
pancreatic cancer, and 1 with non-small cell lung cancer).
Among this subset of patients, the median number of
cycles was 8 and the median duration of PFS was 224 days
(range, 182-588 days). Of particular interest, one of the
patients with metastatic colon cancer who had stable disease for 1 year on the current trial had experienced rapid
disease progression after 2 months of prior therapy with
FOLFOX6; this individual then received FOLFIRI (leucovorin, 5-FU, and irinotecan) and bevacizumab for
nearly 2 years with a partial response achieved, followed
by FOLFIRI plus panitumumab for 7 months with stable
disease achieved.

DISCUSSION
The objectives of the current study were to determine the
recommended dose of PDX followed 24 hours later by a
fixed dose of infusional 5-FU given over 48 hours, and to
test the hypothesis that TS and MTFR genotyping would
correlate with toxicity. The human TS promoter has 3
tandem repeats of a 28-nucleotide G/C-rich sequence in
the first 100 nucleotides upstream of the AUG codon (the
translation start site), as well as 1 inverted copy of the
repeat starting at 2139.1,26-28 At least 1 tandem repeat is
needed for efficient translation of TS messenger RNA
(mRNA); the number of repeats influences the efficiency
of translation, and is polymorphic. Patients may be homozygous for a double or triple tandem repeat (2/2 or 3/3),
or be heterozygous (2/3). An association between the
3866

genotype of the TS enhancer region and response and toxicity with 5-FU-based therapy in patients with colorectal
cancer has been reported previously.29-39: patients who
are homozygous for the double-tandem repeat have a
lower TS protein content and a higher likelihood of
response, but a greater risk of toxicity.
MTHFR is involved in the regeneration of 5 methyltetrahydrofolate from 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate.
The methyl group from 5 methyltetrahydrofolate is
donated to homocysteine using vitamin B12 as a necessary
cofactor to form methionine. Methionine is important in
a variety of 1-carbon transfer reactions. MTHFR deficiency is the most common inherited folate metabolism
disorder.24,25,29,30 The wild-type CC at codon 667 is
associated with normal activity of MTHFR. The C667T
polymorphism is observed in approximately 40% of subjects, and results in an approximately 40% decrease in the
activity of MTHFR. The T667T polymorphism is noted
Cancer

in approximately 10% of subjects, and results in an
approximately 70% decrease in the activity of MTHFR.
Subjects who are homozygous for the T667T polymorphism or heterozygous for the C667T polymorphism are
at an increased risk of toxicity associated with MTX.
There was pronounced variability in clinical toxicity among subjects in the current study with regard to
mucositis. Some patients treated with multiple cycles at
the highest dose level experienced no mucositis, whereas
others treated at lower doses did. Polymorphisms in TS
and MTHFR were not found to be predictive of an
increased risk of mucositis or diarrhea with this regimen. This may perhaps be due to the small number of
patients who were treated on 5 different dose levels of
PDX, or other factors that contribute to clinical toxicity. Determinants of sensitivity to PDX include drug
movement across the cell membrane, intracellular metabolism to polyglutamate forms, inhibition of DHFR
and other folate-dependent enzymes, effects on intracellular folate pools, and interference with DNA synthesis.40 There are 3 different transport systems that
mediate folate influx: the RFC system, the folate receptor system, and a pH-sensitive transporter. Comprehensive analysis of polymorphisms that might influence
these determinants of sensitivity performed within a
trial that uses a uniform dose of PDX may be
informative.
The recommended Phase 2 dose for an every other
week schedule is PDX 148 mg/m2 given on day 1 with 5FU 3000 mg/m2 given over 48 hr every 2 weeks. The
DLT was mucositis. Diarrhea, nausea/vomiting and hematologic toxicities were minimal with this regimen. A
subset of heavily pre-treated patients had progression- free
survivals of 6 months or longer with this regimen. This
included subjects with considerable toxicity on prior regimens, who experienced negligible toxicity with the current regimen of sequential PDX and 48-hour infusion of
5-FU at 2-week intervals.
It has been reported that pre-emptive administration
of delayed leucovorin 50 mg IV 24 hours after weekly
PDX dosing minimizes PDX-associated mucositis while
maintaining antitumor activity.41 In vitro studies suggested that a 24-hr delay between PDX exposure and subsequent exposure to leucovorin did not interfere with
PDX cytotoxicity.42 However, a 72-hr interval was
required between a single exposure to leucovorin and subsequent exposure to PDX to sustain activity without
requiring an increase in PDX concentration. Future studies that incorporate delayed administration of leucovorin
may improve the side effect profile of this regimen. A clinCancer
