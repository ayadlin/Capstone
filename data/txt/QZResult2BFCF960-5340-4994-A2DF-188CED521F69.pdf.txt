Abstract
Effects of concomitant inhibition of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (BCL2L1) were
examined in human myeloid leukemia cells. Tetracycline-inducible Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL dual knockdown
sharply increased PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitor lethality. Conversely, inducible knockdown or dominantnegative AKT increased, whereas constitutively active AKT reduced lethality of the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitor
ABT-737. Furthermore, PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (e.g., BEZ235 and PI-103) synergistically increased ABT-737–
mediated cell death in multiple leukemia cell lines and reduced colony formation in leukemic, but not
normal, CD34þ cells. Notably, increased lethality was observed in four of six primary acute myelogenous
leukemia (AML) specimens. Responding, but not nonresponding, samples exhibited basal AKT phosphorylation. PI3K/mTOR inhibitors markedly downregulated Mcl-1 but increased Bim binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL;
the latter effect was abrogated by ABT-737. Combined treatment also markedly diminished Bax/Bak binding
to Mcl-1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL. Bax, Bak, or Bim (BCL2L11) knockdown or Mcl-1 overexpression signiﬁcantly
diminished regimen-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, pharmacologic inhibition or short hairpin RNA
knockdown of GSK3a/b signiﬁcantly attenuated Mcl-1 downregulation and decreased apoptosis. In a
systemic AML xenograft model, dual tetracycline-inducible knockdown of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL sharply increased
BEZ235 antileukemic effects. In a subcutaneous xenograft model, BEZ235 and ABT-737 coadministration
signiﬁcantly diminished tumor growth, downregulated Mcl-1, activated caspases, and prolonged survival.
Together, these ﬁndings suggest that antileukemic synergism between PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors and BH3
mimetics involves multiple mechanisms, including Mcl-1 downregulation, release of Bim from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
as well as Bak and Bax from Mcl-1/Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, and GSK3a/b, culminating in Bax/Bak activation and
apoptosis. They also argue that combining PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors with BH3 mimetics warrants
attention in AML, particularly in the setting of basal AKT activation and/or addiction. Cancer Res; 73(4);

Introduction
PI3K/AKT/mTOR is one of the most frequently dysregulated
survival signaling pathways in cancer due to multiple genetic
aberrations (1). In acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), this

pathway is activated in 50% to 80% of patients (2) and is
frequently associated with FLT3, Ras, and c-KIT mutations (2),
PI3K-d isoform ampliﬁcation (3), or autocrine IGF-1/IGF-1R
signaling induction (4). Activation of phosphoinositide-3kinase (PI3K) leads to AKT activation, which signals to various
downstream substrates including GSK-3, FOXO, mTOR, Bad,
MDM2, and NF-kB, and modulates diverse cell processes
including survival, proliferation, apoptosis, and autophagy,
among others (5). Recently, multiple inhibitors of this pathway
have been developed, several of which (e.g., BEZ235, GDC0981)
are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in various tumor
types including AML (6).
Overexpression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members such as Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, occurs frequently in cancers, particularly
hematologic malignancies such as AML, resulting in defective
apoptosis leading to enhanced cell survival and drug resistance
(7). Several agents have been developed to target these proteins
directly, for example, ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic that binds
with high afﬁnity to, and antagonizes the functions of, Bcl-2

PI3K/mTOR and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Inhibition in Leukemia

and Bcl-xL but not Mcl-1 (8). Preclinical studies have shown
that ABT-737 induces apoptosis and potentiates the antitumor
activity of multiple agents in various cancers, including leukemia (8). ABT-263, a clinical derivative of ABT-737, is currently undergoing phase I and II clinical evaluation in various
tumor types including leukemia (9).
Recent studies indicate that PI3K inhibitors efﬁciently
downregulate Mcl-1; an event that plays an important role in
transformed cell lethality (10–12). Furthermore, data from
several laboratories, including our own, indicate that Mcl-1,
as well as Bim, which is also tightly regulated by the PI3K
pathway (13, 14), play important roles in determining ABT-737
sensitivity (15–18). These considerations, together with the
evidence of a contribution of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL dysregulation in
leukemogenesis (7), raise the possibility that interference with
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL function might potentiate PI3K inhibitor
activity in this disease. The purpose of the present studies
was to determine whether, and by what mechanisms, dual
inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL might cooperate with PI3K/mTOR
inhibition to induce cell death in AML cells.

Materials and Methods
Cells
Human leukemia U937, KG1, and MV4-11 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and
cultured as described earlier (11). These cells were authenticated by ATCC (basic short tandem repeat proﬁling) at the end
of the studies. Various stable or inducible cell lines used in
these studies are described in Supplementary Methods.
Isolation of patient-derived leukemic blasts and normal
CD34þ cells
Bone marrow or peripheral blood were collected from
patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML), FAB subtype
M2, with a preponderance of blasts, and further enrichment of
mononuclear cell populations achieved by Ficoll–Hypaque
gradient separation as previously described (19). Normal bone
marrow CD34þ cells were obtained with informed consent
from patients undergoing routine diagnostic procedures for
nonmyeloid hematopoietic disorders as before (20). These
studies have been sanctioned by Virginia Commonwealth
University Investigational Review Board.
Mutation analysis
Mutation analysis was conducted on genomic DNA
extracted from primary blasts as previously described (11).
Reagents
ABT-737 was provided by Abbott laboratories (Abbott Park).
BEZ235 was purchased from Chemie Tek. PI-103, LY294002,
GSK3 inhibitor IX (20 Z,30 E)-6-bromoindirubin-30 -oxime (BIO),
and its inactive analogue MeBIO were purchased from Calbiochem. CHIR-98014 was purchased from Sellek chemicals.
MK-2206 was provided by Merck.
Assessment of apoptosis
Apoptosis was routinely assessed by Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) analysis as previously described (21). Ter-

minal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick
end labeling (TUNEL) analysis was also used in some experiments as described earlier (22), and visualized by confocal
microscopy.
Cell growth and viability
Cell growth and viability were assessed by CellTiter-Glo
Luminescent Assay (Promega).
Clonogenicity
Colony-formation assays were conducted in methylcellulose
as previously described (11).
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting
Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were conducted
as previously described (19, 21). Antibodies are listed in Supplementary Materials.
Bax and Bak conformational change
Bax and Bak conformational change was assessed as previously described (11).
Subcellular fractionation
Cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated as previously described (19).
In vivo studies
Animal studies were conducted under an approved protocol
by the Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Two murine models were used:
1) Systemic xenograft model: female NOD/SCID-g
(Jackson laboratories) were injected intravenously via
tail vein with 5  106 luciferase-expressing U937 cells
in which double knockdown of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL is
achieved by doxycycline. Mice were monitored for
tumor growth using the IVIS 200 imaging system
(Xenogen Corporation), separated into 2 groups, one of
which was fed with doxycycline-supplemented pellet
(200 mg/kg, Bio-Serv). Both groups were treated every
24-hour 6 days a week with BEZ235 administered by
gavage.
2) Subcutaneous model: female athymic nude mice
(Charles River laboratories) were inoculated
subcutaneously in the ﬂank with 2.5  106 U937 cells.
Once tumors became apparent, mice were treated
twice daily 5 days per week with BEZ235  ABT-737
administered intraperitoneally. Tumor volumes were
calculated using the formula (length  width2)/2, and
when tumor length reached 2 cm, mice were
euthanized.
Statistical analysis
The signiﬁcance of differences between experimental conditions was determined using the Students t test for unpaired
observations. Survival rates were analyzed by Kaplan–Meier
and comparisons of survival curves and median survival were
analyzed by log-rank test.

Results

striking (e.g., 3 hours) apoptosis was observed in cells in
which both Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were knocked down (Fig. 1A;
bottom). Similar results were obtained with LY294002 (data
not shown) and when cell growth and viability were monitored (Supplementary Fig. S1B). These events were associated with pronounced Bax and Bak conformational changes
(e.g., by PI-103; Fig. 1B, top), reﬂecting activation, rapid, and
profound cytosolic release of cytochrome c and AIF (Fig. 1B,
bottom), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (by PI103 and BEZ235; Fig. 1C), and apoptosis, reﬂected by caspase-3, -9, and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1D). In contrast, agents
exhibited minimal effects in the absence of doxycycline (Fig.
1A–D). Notably, AKT was rapidly dephosphorylated/inactivated by PI3K/mTOR inhibitors (e.g., BEZ235 or PI-103) with
or without doxycycline (Fig. 1D). Conversely, inducible
expression of DN-AKT or shAKT knockdown signiﬁcantly
increased, whereas constitutively active AKT-DD signiﬁcantly decreased ABT-737 lethality, reﬂected by caspase-3/PARP
cleavage and Annexin V/PI positivity (Supplementary Fig.
S2A–C). Collectively, these ﬁndings indicate that the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL interact coordinately
to promote cell survival, suggesting that simultaneous targeting of these pathways may represent an effective antileukemic strategy.

Ectopic expression of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL increases leukemia
cell resistance to apoptosis induced by inhibitors of the
PI3K/AKT pathway
To test the hypothesis that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL confer resistance to PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition in leukemia cells, U937
cells ectopically overexpressing Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL were used.
These cells displayed signiﬁcant resistance to the dual
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors BEZ235 and PI-103, and the AKT
inhibitor perifosine (Supplementary Fig. S1A), as well as the
PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (data not shown), raising the possibility that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL inhibition may potentiate leukemia
cell apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
inhibitors.
Dual knockdown of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL strikingly
potentiates PI3K inhibitor-mediated apoptosis in U937
cells
To determine whether Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL disruption in U937
cells enhances PI3K-mediated apoptosis, inducible knockdown of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or both was carried out using a tetracycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (shRNA) lentiviral system.
Time course analysis (Fig. 1A, top) revealed that doxycycline
induced a sharp decline in levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or both in the
corresponding cells, which was observed after 48-hour exposure and persisted during the ensuing 48 hours. Interestingly,
while individual knockdown of Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL modestly but
signiﬁcantly increased BEZ235, PI-103, or MK-2206 lethality
following 6- to 24-hour exposure (Fig. 1A; bottom), rapid and

Cotreatment with BEZ235 and ABT-737 sharply
increases lethality and reduces colony formation of
primary AML blasts while largely sparing normal CD34þ
cells
TUNEL assays of primary AML blasts revealed that simultaneous, but not individual, administration of BEZ235 and
ABT-737 markedly increased apoptosis (Fig. 3A), associated
with marked AKT dephosphorylation and pronounced
caspase-3 and PARP cleavage (Fig. 3B), similar to results
obtained in U937 cells. Moreover, BEZ235/ABT-737 coexposure enhanced cell death in 4 of 6 AML specimens assayed (Fig.
3C). In contrast, comparable BEZ235 and ABT-737 exposures,
alone or in combination, exerted only minimal toxicity toward
normal CD34þ cells (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, all responding AML
samples exhibited discernible basal AKT phosphorylation/
activation (Fig. 3E). In contrast, nonresponding specimens
(#1 and #6), like normal CD34þ cells, displayed no detectable
phospho-AKT (Fig. 3E). Protein levels of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1,

substantially increased cell death induced by BEZ235 (e.g., 50–
1,000 nmol/L; Fig. 2A) or PI-103 (e.g., 1–4 mmol/L, Fig. 2B).
Conversely, marginally toxic concentrations of BEZ235 (0.5
mmol/L) or PI-103 (3 mmol/L) sharply increased ABT-737
lethality (e.g., 0.25–2 mmol/L; Fig. 2C). Time course analysis
of cells exposed simultaneously to BEZ235 (0.5 mmol/L) and
ABT-737 (0.5 mmol/L) revealed approximately 20% cell death at
8 hours, and substantially more pronounced lethality after 18
hours (70%, Supplementary Fig. S3). Similar results were
obtained in multiple other leukemia cell lines, including
FLT3-ITD-dependent MV4-11 and KG1 cells (Fig. 2D). Treatment of U937 cells with BEZ235 and ABT-737 induced pronounced cytosolic release of cytochrome c and AIF, membrane
translocation of Bax (Fig. 2E), and cleavage/activation of
caspases-3, and -9, and PARP (Fig. 2F). In contrast, BEZ235
or ABT-737 alone had only minimal effects (Fig. 2E and F).

and Bim exhibited considerable variability among the samples
analyzed. Importantly, 2 responding samples exhibited high
Mcl-1 protein levels. Mutation analysis revealed that 2 of the
responding specimens harbored FLT3 mutations, including a
point mutation (FLT3/D835) in patient #2 and internal tandem
duplication (FLT3/ITD) in patient #3. However, no mutations
in PI3Ka, AKT1, Kras, Nras, or MEK1 were detected (Supplementary Table S1).
Parallel colony-forming assays revealed that combined, but
not individual, treatment with BEZ235 or LY294002 and ABT737 strikingly reduced leukemic cell colony formation (Fig. 3F).
In contrast, the colony-forming capacity of normal CD34þ cells
was not signiﬁcantly reduced by agents alone or in combination (Fig. 3G).
Mcl-1 downregulation contributes to BEZ235/ABT-737
lethality
BEZ235 signiﬁcantly reduced Mcl-1 protein levels in U937
cells (Fig. 4A) as well as primary AML blasts (Fig. 4B, top)
and KG1 cells (data not shown). Moreover, Mcl-1 downregulation by BEZ235 persisted in cells cotreated with ABT737, which by itself increased Mcl-1 protein levels (Fig. 4A),
consistent with reports involving other cells (23). Notably,
ABT-737 signiﬁcantly increased Noxa protein levels, but,
expression was sharply diminished by treatment with
BEZ235 administered alone or in combination with ABT737 (Fig. 4A). A modest increase in Bax expression was
observed following exposure to agents alone or in combination (Fig. 4A). In contrast, no major changes occurred in
the expression of other antiapoptotic family members, that
is, Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL or proapoptotic members Bim, Bad, Bak,
or NBK (Fig. 4A). Notably, increased Mcl-1 protein levels
induced by the Bcl-2/Bcl-xL antagonist ABT-737 were recapitulated genetically by dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL knockdown (Fig.
4B, bottom).

Furthermore, the amount of Bak or Bax bound to Mcl-1 sharply
declined following 4- to 8-hour treatment with BEZ235 (Fig. 4E
and F, respectively). Decreased Bak/Bcl-xL or Bax/Bcl-2 binding was also observed at 8-hour of treatment. In addition, ABT737 markedly diminished binding of Bak to Bcl-xL and of Bax to
both Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, but not to Mcl-1. However, combined
treatment with BEZ235/ABT-737 sharply reduced Bak and

Finally, Bax or Bak knockdown signiﬁcantly protected cells
from BEZ235/ABT-737 lethality, reﬂected by diminished caspase-3 and PARP cleavage (Supplementary Fig. S4A) and
Annexin V/PI positivity (Fig. 4G). Together, these ﬁndings
have shown that BEZ235 and ABT-737 exposure releases Bak
and Bax from the major neutralizing molecules Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and Mcl-1, and that Bax and Bak play signiﬁcant functional
roles in regimen antileukemic activity.
BEZ235/ABT-737–mediated apoptosis involves Bim but
not Bad
Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that while BEZ235
reduced the amount of Mcl-1 bound to Bim presumably
reﬂecting Mcl-1 downregulation, it markedly increased Bim
binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL (Fig. 5A). Signiﬁcantly, these
effects were essentially abrogated by ABT-737 cotreatment.

PI3K pathway and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition, multiple
approaches were used. Exposure to BEZ235 alone or with
ABT-737 sharply decreased b-catenin and c-Myc, 2 well-established GSK3a/b substrates, indicating GSK3a/b activation
(refs. 26, 27; Fig. 6A). A modest decrease in GSK3 phosphorylation also occurred after BEZ235/ABT-737 treatment. Notably, the GSK3 inhibitors CHIR-98014 or BIO, but not the
inactive analogue MeBIO, signiﬁcantly attenuated BEZ235
antileukemic activity in Bcl-2/Bcl-xL doxycycline knockdown
cells (Fig. 6B). Furthermore, BEZ235/ABT-737 lethality was
also signiﬁcantly reduced by CHIR-98014 or BIO, but not
MeBIO (Fig. 6C). Of note, these GSK3 inhibitors alone exhibited
no lethal effects (Supplemental Fig. 6A). Similar results were
obtained when cell growth and viability were assessed (Supplemental Fig. S6B). Interestingly, effects of GSK3 inhibitors on
BEZ235/ABT-737 lethality correlated with signiﬁcant attenuation of Mcl-1 downregulation, complete reversal of b-catenin
and c-Myc downregulation, and substantially decreased caspase-3 activation by CHIR-98014 or BIO, but not by MeBIO (Fig.
6D).
Parallel studies revealed that GSK3a or GSK3b shRNA
knockdown also signiﬁcantly reduced BEZ235/ABT-737–
mediated caspase-3 and PARP cleavage (Fig. 6E), and cell death
(Fig. 6F). Notably, these effects were associated with attenuation of Mcl-1 downregulation (Fig. 6E). Together, these ﬁnd-

1346

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

ings argue for a functional role for GSK3a/b activation in
lethality induced by concurrent Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and PI3K pathway inhibition, and implicate Mcl-1 downregulation/degradation in this phenomenon.
Concomitant PI3K and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibition increases
apoptosis, inhibits tumor growth, and enhances survival
in in vivo leukemia xenograft models
To determine whether antagonizing Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL functions enhances PI3K inhibition lethality in vivo, a systemic
xenograft mouse model using luciferase-labeled U937 cells
expressing doxycycline-inducible shRNAs against both Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL was used. Interestingly, BEZ235 signiﬁcantly
reduced in vivo tumor growth following dual Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
knockdown compared with control tumors with intact Bcl2/Bcl-xL (Fig. 7A), associated with prolonged median survival,
from 13 to 23 days (Supplementary Fig. S7A). Survival curves
also differed signiﬁcantly; P < 0.03 by log-rank test. No effects of
doxycycline alone on tumor growth or survival were observed
(not shown).
Parallel studies using a subcutaneous U937 xenograft
mouse model revealed that ABT-737/BEZ235 cotreatment
signiﬁcantly reduced tumor growth (Fig. 7B and C and
Supplementary Fig. S7B), In contrast, effects were less
pronounced with BEZ235 and no effect was observed with

either BEZ235 or ABT-737 alone; P < 0.01; log-rank test.

ABT-737. Western blot analysis conducted on excised tumor
tissue from treated animals revealed that BEZ235 alone or
with ABT-737 markedly decreased Mcl-1 protein levels and
AKT phosphorylation, analogous to in vitro observations
(Fig. 7D). Interestingly, combined, but not individual, treatment sharply potentiated apoptosis manifested by a pronounced increase in caspase-3 processing and PARP cleavage (Fig. 7D). Finally, Kaplan–Meier analysis (Fig. 7E)
revealed that combined treatment signiﬁcantly prolonged
survival (P < 0.01 vs. single-agent treatment; log-rank test),
whereas no effect was observed with ABT-737, and only a
modest prolongation with BEZ235. Notably, mouse weights
did not exhibit major changes (e.g. > 10%) in mice treated
with agents alone or in combination (Supplementary Fig.
S7C). Together, these ﬁndings indicate that combined treatment with BEZ235 and ABT-737 signiﬁcantly inhibits tumor
growth in vivo in association with diminished AKT phosphorylation, Mcl-1 downregulation, apoptosis induction,
and prolonged survival in leukemia-bearing mice.

Discussion
Preclinical studies have shown that AML cells are susceptible to PI3K inhibitors (28, 29). However, as in the case of
other targeted agents, interruption of a single signaling
pathway may be insufﬁcient to induce cell death (30).
Strategies to enhance the antitumor activity of PI3K inhibitors include simultaneously interrupting the MEK/ERK
pathway (11), inhibiting histone deacetylases (31, 32), or
cyclin-dependant kinases (33) among others. Here, dual
inhibition of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL by the BH3-mimetic ABT737 was used to potentiate PI3K inhibitor antileukemic
activity based on several considerations. First, Bcl-2 family
members are frequently dysregulated in transformed cells,
for example, overexpression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or Mcl-1 (7),
and/or diminished expression/loss of Bim, Bax, Noxa, and
Bik (34–36). Second, PI3K inhibitors disrupt the balance
between the pro- and antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members via
downregulation of Mcl-1 and upregulation/activation of
Bak, Bax, Bim, and Bad (10). Third, these events, particularly

Rahmani et al.

Mcl-1 downregulation, play important roles in determining sensitivity to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL inhibitors (e.g. ABT-737;
refs. 15–17).
The observation that tetracycline-inducible dual knockdown of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL sharply increases, whereas ectopic
expression signiﬁcantly diminishes PI3K inhibitor lethality
indicate that these antiapoptotic proteins play critical functional roles in protecting leukemic cells from lethality triggered
by PI3K pathway interruption. Conversely, evidence that
expression of tetracycline-responsive dominant-negative or
shRNA constructs against AKT substantially increase, whereas
constitutively active AKT decrease ABT-737 lethality argues
that the PI3K/AKT pathway plays an important functional role
in protecting leukemia cells from BH3 mimetic-induced cell
death. Notably, individual Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL knockdown also
potentiated PI3K/AKT inhibitor lethality, but enhancement
was signiﬁcantly less than for dual Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL knockdown. Such ﬁndings suggest that Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL cooperate to
prevent apoptosis induced by PI3K/AKT pathway interruption.
Consistent with this notion, simultaneous pharmacologic
inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway (e.g., by BEZ235) and
Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (e.g., by ABT-737) recapitulated the lethality of
genetic interventions, and markedly reduced colony formation
of multiple AML cell lines and primary blast specimens.
Importantly, this regimen exerted only modest toxicity toward
normal hematopoietic progenitors (CD34þ). This may reﬂect
the preferential toxicity of BH3 mimetics such as ABT-737
toward transformed cells (8, 15), as well as the dependence of
leukemic cells on PI3K/AKT activation for survival (2).
Between 50% and 80% of patient-derived AML cells display
phosphorylation of AKT (2). Analysis of AKT phosphorylation
patterns in primary blasts raises the possibility of a correlation
between AKT activation and responses to combined treatment
with PI3K inhibitors and ABT-737. Speciﬁcally, 4 of 6 specimens analyzed responded to the treatment and all exhibited
basal AKT phosphorylation. In contrast, basal AKT phosphorylation was not detected in nonresponding specimens or in
normal CD34þ cells. While leukemic cell AKT activation may
be multifactorial, for example, secondary to c-Kit or FLT3
mutations, IGF-R activation etc., or infrequently, mutations
in PI3K or AKT (2), in many instances, mechanisms of AKT
activation are unknown. Of note, only 2 of 4 specimens displaying AKT activation had identiﬁable mutations (i.e., FLT3).
Regardless of the cause, a subset of leukemia cells may be
addicted to this pathway, manifested by basal AKT activation,
and thus particularly sensitive to PI3K/AKT inhibitor/BH3
mimetic regimens. However, analysis of a substantially larger
number of specimens, taking into account expression of other
relevant proteins (e.g., Mcl-1 and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL), and the possible confounding effects of cell sample heterogeneity, will be
required to assess potential correlations between basal AKT
status and responses more deﬁnitely. Similar considerations
apply to comparisons between the relative abilities of AKTassociated mutations versus basal activation status in predicting sensitivity. Such studies are currently in progress. Of note,
some of the responding specimen (e.g., #2 and #4) exhibited
high basal levels of Mcl-1, an antiapoptotic protein implicated
in leukemogenesis (37, 38), raising the possibility that this

1348

Cancer Res; 73(4) February 15, 2013

strategy may be effective in AML characterized by high Mcl-1
expression.
The ability of dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitors such as BEZ235 or
PI-103 to downregulate Mcl-1 in leukemia cells is consistent
with results involving other cell types (39). Classically, this
effect has been attributed to multiple mechanisms: (i) transcriptional, via inhibition of the CREB transcription factor (40),
(ii) translational, via inhibition of the mTOR/p70S6K/4EBP
axis (41), and (iii) posttranslational, through enhanced Mcl-1
proteasomal degradation (42, 43). The ﬁnding that ectopic Mcl1 expression signiﬁcantly attenuated PI3K/mTOR inhibitor/
ABT-737 lethality argues that Mcl-1 downregulation contributes functionally to cell death. This is supported by the
observation that ABT-737 administration or Bcl-2/Bcl-xL
knockdown, increased Mcl-1 protein levels, a phenomenon
shown to confer a survival advantage to leukemia cells (17, 23).
Interestingly, while BEZ235 alone downregulated Mcl-1, it did
not signiﬁcantly increase lethality. It is likely that Mcl-1 downregulation cooperates with disruption of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL
function, and potentially Mcl-1-independent effects of BEZ235,
to trigger an increase in apoptosis (15–17).
PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition leads to GSK3 activation,
which may exert antitumor effects through multiple downstream targets, including Mcl-1, Bim, FOXO-3, b-catenin, and cMyc, among others (44, 45). The ﬁnding that direct inhibition of
GSK3 by BIO or CHIR-98014 signiﬁcantly diminished BEZ235
lethality in cells in which Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were knocked down,
along with diminished BEZ235/ABT-737 lethality in cells in
which GSK3 was disabled (e.g., by BIO or CHIR-98014 or by
shRNA-knockdown) argue that GSK3a/b plays a signiﬁcant
functional role in lethality. Because GSK3 promotes Mcl-1
proteasomal degradation (42, 43), GSK3 knockdown or inhibition may protect cells from BEZ235/ABT-737 lethality by
preventing this process. In support of this concept, Mcl-1
downregulation in BEZ235/ABT-737-treated cells was attenuated when GSK3 was inhibited pharmacologically or by shRNA.
However, Mcl-1 downregulation was not completely prevented, suggesting alternative mechanism(s) of Mcl-1 regulation. It is recognized that Mcl-1 downregulation may not be the
sole mechanism by which GSK3 promotes BEZ235/ABT737
lethality, and that alternative or additional GSK3 downstream
events may contribute to this process. Nevertheless, these data
are compatible with the notion that GSK3 contributes functionally to BEZ235/ABT737 lethality through a mechanism
involving Mcl-1 downregulation.
PI3K/mTOR inhibitors and ABT-737 coadministration
induced multiple perturbations in the expression of and interactions between Bcl-2 family members, which collectively may
have contributed to cell death. Recent studies have highlighted
the importance of interactions involving proteins such as Bim,
rather than simply expression patterns (e.g., of Mcl-1) in
determining cell fate (46). In the present study, PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors profoundly modulated Bim distribution manifested
by a marked increase of Bim binding to Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. This
phenomenon, which to the best of our knowledge, has not
previously been described, could have contributed to cell death
attenuation. Signiﬁcantly, ABT-737 completely abrogated Bim
binding to Bcl-2/Bcl-xL, which may have allowed Bim to

PI3K/mTOR and Bcl-2/Bcl-xL Inhibition in Leukemia

activate Bax and Bak, thereby exerting proapoptotic actions.
This notion is supported by the observed release of Bak and Bax
from all major antiapoptotic Bcl-2 members. Speciﬁcally, ABT737 exposure abrogated binding of Bak to Bcl-xL, and Bax to
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. Moreover, binding of both Bak and Bax to
Mcl-1 was also markedly reduced by PI3K inhibitors, presumably a consequence of Mcl-1 downregulation. In this context,
Bak and Bax are normally maintained in an inactive state in
part by tethering to Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, and simultaneous
inhibition of these processes dramatically increases cell death
(47). It should be noted that while many studies have described
a physical binding between Mcl-1 and Bax in diverse cell types
(46, 48), other studies reported weak or no binding between
these proteins (47, 49). A possible explanation for these discrepancies may reﬂect the stoichiometric abundance of other
Mcl-1 partners (e.g., Noxa, Bak) as well as Bax partners (e.g.,
Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) in various cells. Collectively, these ﬁndings
support a model wherein combined PI3K inhibitor and ABT737 exposure leads to multiple events promoting cell death
including (i) Bim release from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL (by ABT-737) or
from Mcl-1 (by PI3K/mTOR inhibitor); (ii) Bak and Bax release
from Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1; and (iii) Bak/Bax activation and
apoptosis. This interpretation is supported by evidence that
Bim, Bax, or Bak shRNA knockdown, or ectopic expression of
Mcl-1, Bcl-2, or Bcl-xL signiﬁcantly diminished PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor/ABT-737-mediated lethality. Finally, previous studies
have implicated BAD in PI3K inhibitor lethality (50). However,
Bad shRNA knockdown, in sharp contrast to Bim, failed to
protect leukemia cells from BEZ235/ABT-737 lethality, suggesting that Bad does not play a major role in this setting.
Finally, in vivo studies have shown that simultaneous inhibition of Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and the PI3K/AKT pathway markedly
inhibited leukemia growth and increased survival in an AML
xenograft model in association with several events observed in
vitro, that is, AKT dephosphorylation/inactivation, Mcl-1
downregulation, and caspase activation, suggesting that suf-

ﬁciently high BEZ235 and ABT-737 concentrations can be
achieved in vivo to recapitulate in vitro actions. Of note, little
toxicity was observed in animals with the doses and schedules
used in these studies. The present ﬁndings also suggest that
multiple factors contribute to these interactions, including
Mcl-1 downregulation, perturbations in associations between
pro- (e.g., Bim, Bak, and Bax) and anti-(e.g. Bcl-2/Bcl-xL/Mcl-1)
proteins, and raise the possibility that basal AKT activation
status may predict susceptibility to this approach. Collectively,
these studies argue that strategies using PI3K/mTOR inhibitors to enhance the antileukemic activity of BH3-mimetics
such as ABT-737 warrants attention in AML, particularly in the
setting of disease in which cells may be addicted to AKT.
Accordingly, further efforts to test this concept are currently
underway.
