Abstract
Changes to androgen signaling during prostate carcinogenesis are associated with both inhibition of cellular
differentiation and promotion of malignant phenotypes. The androgen receptor (AR)–binding transcription
factor RUNX2 has been linked to prostate cancer progression but the underlying mechanisms have not been fully
deﬁned. In this study, we investigated the genome-wide inﬂuence of RUNX2 on androgen-induced gene
expression and AR DNA binding in prostate cancer cells. RUNX2 inhibited the androgen response partly by
promoting the dissociation of AR from its target genes such as the tumor suppressor NKX3-1. However, AR activity
persists in the presence of RUNX2 at other AR target genes, some of which are cooperatively stimulated by
androgen and RUNX2 signaling. These genes are associated with putative enhancers co-occupied by AR and
RUNX2. One such gene, the invasion-promoting Snail family transcription factor SNAI2, was co-activated by AR
and RUNX2. Indeed, these two transcription factors together, but neither alone stimulated prostate cancer cell
invasiveness, which could be abolished by SNAI2 silencing. Furthermore, an immunohistochemical analysis of
SNAI2 in archived primary prostate cancer specimens revealed a correlation with the RUNX2 histoscore, and
simultaneous strong staining for SNAI2, RUNX2, and AR (but not any pair alone) was associated with disease
recurrence. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest cooperation between AR and RUNX in the stimulation of oncogenes such
as SNAI2, which might be targeted for individualized prostate cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 74(10); 2857–68. 2014

Introduction
Contrasting their role in prostate epithelial cell differentiation and physiological functions, androgens acquire oncologic roles during prostate carcinogenesis, including promotion of
cellular proliferation, survival, and aerobic glycolysis (1–4).
These changes are associated with redistribution of the androgen receptor (AR) across the prostate cancer cell genome and
alterations to its transcriptional regulatory properties (5, 6).
Contributing to changes in its genomic locations and activities
are AR coactivators and collaborating DNA-binding proteins

such as FOXA1, NKX3-1, GATA2, RUNX2, and members of the
ETS family of transcription factors (6–9).
The mammalian RUNX family consists of 3 transcription
factors with well-established roles in both development and
cancer (10–12). RUNX2, best known for its roles in skeletal
development (13, 14), has also been implicated in carcinogenesis, including the promotion of breast and prostate
cancer metastasis (8, 15–20). RUNX2 activity in prostate
cancer is negatively regulated by PTEN through a FOXO1dependent mechanism (21), RUNX2 expression progressively
increases during prostate cancer development in the PTEN
conditional knockout mouse model (22) and its immunoreactivity is higher in human prostate cancer than in prostatic
intraepithelial neoplasia (PIN) and normal prostate epithelium (16, 23, 24). Furthermore, manipulation of RUNX2 in
tissue culture and xenograft mouse models of prostate
cancer metastasis alters invasiveness and tissue destruction
(16, 17).
RUNX2 directly interacts with and inﬂuences the activity of
other transcription factors, including members of the nuclear
hormone receptor family. In both breast cancer cells and
osteoblasts, RUNX2 and estrogen signaling modulate each
other's activity in a locus-speciﬁc manner, with implications
for the regulation of both breast cancer progression and bone
mass control (12, 20, 25–27). In osteoblasts, RUNX2 interacts

with and augments the transcriptional activity of the vitamin D receptor at the osteocalcin gene (28). Finally, RUNX2
directly binds the AR, and this interaction is potentially
important for both modulating and interpreting androgen
signaling in various physiologic and pathologic contexts
including bone metabolism and prostate cancer progression
(8, 27, 29).
In prostate cancer and other cell types, physical interaction between AR and RUNX2's DNA-binding domain inhibits
RUNX2's recruitment to and activation of target genes
(8, 27, 29, 30). Limited investigations of the reciprocal effects,
those of RUNX2 on AR, led to apparently conﬂicting results
indicating either inhibition (29, 31) or stimulation (30, 32) of
AR activity. To address the hypothesis that RUNX2 inﬂuences AR activity in a locus-dependent manner, we set out to
characterize genome-wide the inﬂuence of RUNX2 on AR–
regulated gene expression by comprehensive mRNA proﬁling
of C4-2B/Rx2dox prostate cancer cells after activation of the
AR with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and/or induction of
RUNX2 by doxycycline (dox). As previously described, dox
increases RUNX2 expression in these cells from hardly
detectable to levels normally seen in other cell lines (17).
The gene expression proﬁles, in combination with chromatin
immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses of
RUNX2 and AR, demonstrate complex remodeling of the
AR–regulated gene network. Whereas RUNX2 generally
attenuated recruitment of AR and stimulation of target
genes, AR remained bound and active upon a speciﬁc subset
of genes and even synergized with RUNX2 in some cases.
Here we pursued the mechanistic basis of these diverse
interactions and then investigated the signiﬁcance of the
synergistic activation of SNAI2 by RUNX2 and AR.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Dox and DHT, both from Sigma-Aldrich, were used at ﬁnal
concentrations of 10 nmol/L and 0.25 mg/mL, respectively. AR
(N-20), RUNX2 (M70), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (V-18) antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology; Flag (M2) and SNAI2 (C19G7) antibodies were from SigmaAldrich and Cell Signaling Technology, respectively. RUNX2
(ab76956) and AR (F.39.4.1) antibodies for immunohistochemistry were from Abcam and Biogenex Laboratories, respectively.
Protein-A dynabeads were from Invitrogen. Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle Medium (DMEM) and RPMI-1640 media were from
Mediatech, Inc. FBS was from Omega Scientiﬁc. Charcoal
dextran stripped serum (CSS) was from Gemini Bio Products.
Cell culture and immunoﬂuorescence
COS7 cells and the human prostate cancer cell lines C4-2B/
Rx2dox, 22Rv1/Rx2dox, and LNCaP/Rx2dox were previously
described (8, 17) and have been passaged for less than 6
months. Prostate cancer cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS and COS7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 5% FBS. Hygromycin (50 mg/mL) and
puromycin (1 mg/mL) were used to select cells that had
incorporated the Rx2dox and the shSNAI2 lentiviral vectors,

respectively. Two days before initiation of hormone treatment,
10% FBS was replaced with 5% CSS, and all experiments were
performed in the absence of any selection marker. AR and
RUNX2 immunoﬂuorescence studies were performed using
the N20 and M70 primary antibodies and ﬂuorescein- and
rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies, respectively.
Cells were mounted using Vectashield mounting medium with
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories
Inc.) and viewed using an LSM 510 Zeiss confocal microscope
(Carl Zeiss). Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching
(FRAP) was carried out as previously described (8).
ChIP, mRNA, DNA, and protein assays
AR ChIP and Flag-RUNX2 ChIP were performed essentially as
described previously (9, 33). Processing and quantiﬁcation of
mRNA and ChIP by quantitative PCR (qPCR) was as described
(33) using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Western blot analyses were carried out essentially as described (33).
Invasion assay
C4-2B/Rx2dox/Luc cells, expressing RUNX2 conditionally
and ﬁreﬂy luciferase constitutively (17) were suspended in
serum-free medium and seeded in 24-well plates for morphology assessment, or in Matrigel-coated inserts (BD Biosciences)
for evaluating invasiveness. The inserts were placed for 24
hours in wells containing 5% CSS, and nonmigrating cells were
removed. Results are presented as invasion indices, deﬁned as
the ratio between the luciferase activity in cells that invaded
through Matrigel-coated membranes and the respective values
obtained from cells plated in control inserts with uncoated
membranes. Treatment with DHT and/or dox commenced
48 hours before seeding in the inserts and lasted throughout
the experiment. Silencing of SNAI2 was performed as described
(20).
Bioinformatics
Gene expression proﬁling was performed as described previously (17, 33) and in the Supplementary Methods. Brieﬂy,
total RNA from C4-2B/Rx2dox cells was extracted in biological
triplicates and hybridized to BeadChip HumanHT-12 v4 (Illumina Inc.).
For RUNX2 and AR genomic occupancy, read coordinates
(aligned to hg18) for RUNX2 and AR ChIP-seq experiments
were obtained from our recent paper (33) and from Massie
and colleagues (3), respectively. A total of 36,698 RUNX2
peaks and 10,949 AR peaks were detected using MACS (34)
with a P-value threshold of P  1E10. Scoring proﬁles were
constructed as described previously (35). Detailed methodologies and the combinatorial effects of AR and RUNX2 were
described in the Supplementary Methods. Microarray gene
expression data have been uploaded to GEO, accession no.

Immunohistochemistry
A series of 95 prostate cancer patients with lymph node
involvement who had undergone radical prostatectomy for
locally advanced disease were selected from the institutional
database at the University of Southern California. Clinical

characteristics are described in Supplementary Table S2.
Detailed methodologies are described in Supplementary Methods. Scoring of the SNAI2 (0,1,2,3), AR (high/low), and RUNX2
(high/low) immunoreactivity was performed under the
supervision of a certiﬁed prostate cancer pathologist, and
only regions of invasive carcinoma were considered. The
Institutional Review Board of USC approved the tissue
procurement protocol for this study (IRB approval HS-0800590). Appropriate written informed consent was obtained
from all patients.

Results
RUNX2 antagonizes AR recruitment to and stimulation of
the majority (type I) of DHT-stimulated genes
Three cell lines were used in this study to investigate the
inﬂuence of RUNX2 on AR-driven gene expression in prostate
cancer cells. All 3 lines are essentially RUNX2 negative and each
was engineered with the Rx2dox lentiviral system, which facilitates RUNX2 induction upon dox treatment (8). The LNCaP
and the C4-2B cell lines require presence of androgens for
AR activation, whereas the 22Rv1 cell line also expresses AR
variants that are active independent of ligand (36). We ﬁrst
analyzed global mRNA proﬁles of C4-2B/Rx2dox cells treated
with DHT to activate the AR and/or with dox to induce RUNX2
expression (Fig. 1A). DHT signiﬁcantly upregulated 2002 genes
(false discovery rate–adjusted P < 0.01). To illustrate the global
inﬂuence of RUNX2 on the DHT response, we plotted the
normalized gene expression values from cells cotreated with
DHT plus dox against the respective values from cells treated
with DHT alone (Fig. 1B). Approximately half (1,148) of the

genes responded in a similar manner to DHT alone and to DHT
plus dox (Fig. 1B and C, gray). The remaining 854 genes
responded differently to DHT plus dox compared with DHT
alone, and of these, 751 (88%, henceforth type I) were less
strongly stimulated in the presence of RUNX2 (Fig. 1B and C,
open circles). Similarly, in the reciprocal orientation, the
predominant inﬂuence of DHT was attenuation of RUNX2mediated stimulation of gene expression (Supplementary Fig.
S1). Thus, in prostate cancer cells, AR and RUNX2 are generally
antagonistic, consistent with the expression patterns of handpicked genes previously investigated in this and other cell types
(29, 30). Interestingly, however, 12% of the DHT-stimulated
genes whose expression was modiﬁed by RUNX2 were further
stimulated, rather than inhibited when RUNX2 was induced.
These 103 genes were designated type II (Fig. 1B and C,
triangles). Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 list the DHTstimulated genes, whereby the response to DHT is attenuated
(type I) or augmented (type II) in the presence versus
absence of RUNX2. Reverse transcription (RT)-qPCR analysis
essentially conﬁrmed the expression pattern of several type I
and type II genes (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Tables S3 and
S4). RT-qPCR analysis of these genes in another prostate
cancer cell line, LNCaP/Rx2dox, demonstrated similar locusdependent effects of RUNX2 on DHT-stimulated genes (Fig.
2A, bottom panels and Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). We
also investigated the effects of RUNX2 on DHT-stimulated
genes by RT-qPCR in the 22Rv1/Rx2dox cell line, a model of
castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interestingly,
the results from 22Rv1 cells were unlike those in LNCaP and
C4-2B cells, with type II behavior representing the most
common mode of interaction in this CRPC model (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that the interaction
between RUNX2 and AR signaling is not only locus dependent, but may also be modiﬁed during the transition from
androgen dependent prostate cancer to CRPC. This speculation is the focus of an ongoing investigation, which is
outside the scope of the present study.
The functional interrelationships between AR and RUNX2
could be related to the physical interaction between these
two transcription factors. Indeed, similar to PC3-AR, COS7,
SaOS-2, and MC3T3E-1 cells (8, 29), the two transcription
factors seem to physically interact in the C4-2B/Rx2dox
culture model as well. This is suggested by coimmunoﬂuorescence imaging of dox-treated C4-2B/Rx2dox cells, which
demonstrated colocalization of AR and RUNX2 within distinct nuclear domains (Fig. 3A) as well as alteration to AR
cellular distribution, from a relatively uniform nuclear
staining in the absence of RUNX2 to textural staining that
includes nuclear speckles co-occupied by the two proteins
once RUNX2 is expressed (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, RUNX2
modiﬁed the FRAP of GFP-AR (Fig. 3B), indicating that
RUNX2 inﬂuenced AR intranuclear mobility, consistent
with physical interaction between the two proteins in living
cells. As control, mobility of the AR-A573D mutant, which
binds neither DNA nor RUNX2 (8), was not inﬂuenced by
RUNX2 (Fig. 3B). Although binding of RUNX2 to AR within
distinct subnuclear domains may underlie the modiﬁcation
of the androgen response by RUNX2, it cannot explain the

locus-dependent interaction observed in type I versus type
II genes (Figs. 1 and 2A).
Because recruitment of AR is central to androgen-mediated stimulation of target genes, we measured AR occupancy by ChIP-qPCR at known androgen response elements
(ARE) associated with the type I genes NKX3-1 and TMPRSS2
and the type II genes PIP and PGC (6, 30, 37, 38). As
expected, treatment of either C4-2B/Rx2dox or LNCaP/
Rx2dox cells with DHT alone resulted in AR recruitment to
AREs of both type I and type II genes (Fig. 2B). When RUNX2
was induced along with DHT treatment, we observed
differing behaviors of the AR in both these cell lines.
Although RUNX2 attenuated AR recruitment to the type I
genes (Fig. 2B, black), likely contributing to their blunted
DHT response, RUNX2 did not attenuate (PGC) and even

enhanced (PIP) the recruitment of AR to AREs near type II
genes (Fig. 2B, gray). Thus, RUNX2 inﬂuences DHT-mediated AR recruitment to and activation of target genes in a
locus-dependent manner.
Regions doubly occupied by AR and RUNX2 are found
near type II genes
Although RUNX2-mediated attenuation of DHT responsiveness in type I genes was attributable in part to lesser AR
recruitment, the uninhibited DHT response of type II genes,
and in particular the enhanced response of PGC, could not be
explained simply based on AR recruitment (Fig. 2). We tested,
initially by RUNX2 ChIP-qPCR, the alternative and nonmutually exclusive hypothesis that RUNX2 itself is recruited
along with AR to type II genes. Indeed, RUNX2 was readily

dox as compared with DHT alone is attributable to regulation
by enhancers capable of recruiting both AR and RUNX2, and
that the binding of RUNX2 to these enhancers allows them
to escape RUNX2-mediated attenuation of the androgen
response. Seeking further support for this view, we mapped
the doubly-occupied presumptive enhancers with respect to
the TSSs of type II versus type I genes. Enumeration of the
doubly-occupied enhancers as a function of distance from
their respective nearest TSSs revealed many more doublyoccupied enhancers near type II as compared with type I
TSSs (Fig. 4D). Remarkably, 27 (27%) of the 100 type II genes
with mapped Refseq coordinates had doubly occupied
enhancers between positions 30 and þ30 kb, compared
with only 7.6% (60/792) of type I genes having corresponding
doubly occupied enhancers (Fig. 4D). Although the enrichment for doubly occupied enhancers near type II compared
with type I genes dramatically dropped as a function of
distance from the respective TSSs, it remained signiﬁcantly
higher at distances exceeding 200-kb (Fig. 4D), likely reﬂecting looping of doubly-occupied enhancers onto type II target
genes located many kilobases away.

detectable at the AREs of the type II genes PIP and PGC, but
not at the AREs of the type I genes NKX3-1 and TMPRSS2 (Fig.
4A). We further tested this hypothesis at the whole genome
level by reanalyzing our RUNX2 ChIP-seq dataset (33) along
with an AR ChIP-seq dataset obtained in LNCaP cells (3). We
initially determined the frequency of ARORs that also
recruited RUNX2. As shown in Fig. 4B, 1,794 (16%) of the
10,949 AR ChIP-seq peaks overlapped with RUNX2 peaks.
Using the same two datasets, we then plotted the average
RUNX2 ChIP-seq signal and the average AR signal across AR
peaks adjacent to (within 10 kb of) the TSS of type I and type II
genes (Fig. 4C). These genome-wide aggregate proﬁles clearly
demonstrated the presence of a strong RUNX2 signal at AR
peaks associated with type II (Fig. 4C, right) but not type I (Fig.
4C, left) genes. These results suggest that the increased
expression of type II genes in cells treated with DHT plus

RUNX2 and AR synergistically stimulate a subset of type II
genes that includes SNAI2
We had initially deﬁned type II genes based on stronger
stimulation by DHT plus dox as compared with DHT alone
(Fig. 1). Because we observed more RUNX2 occupancy near
type II as compared with type I genes (Fig. 4), the high
expression of type II genes in cells treated with DHT plus dox
compared with DHT alone could simply reﬂect the summed
stimulatory effects of AR and RUNX2. Close examination of
the expression proﬁles of type II genes, however, revealed
cases of synergistic, rather than additive stimulation by DHT
and RUNX2. Indeed, a scatter plot of the RUNX2 response of
type II genes in the presence versus absence of DHT (Fig. 5A)
demonstrates that many (61%) of the type II genes, hereafter
type IIA, were synergistically stimulated by DHT and dox.
One of the clearest examples of synergism was SNAI2
(see Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S5). Consistent with
previous investigations (17, 39), RT-qPCR analysis shows
that each of DHT and RUNX2 increases SNAI2 mRNA levels
in prostate cancer cells (Fig. 5B). More importantly, and
consistent with the microarray analysis, the simultaneous
induction of RUNX2 (by dox) and activation of AR (by DHT)
results in cooperative stimulation of SNAI2 transcription in
three different prostate cancer cell lines, with particularly
strong synergism in C4-2B cells (Fig. 5B). Western blot
analysis conﬁrmed the synergism between AR and RUNX2
in stimulating SNAI2 expression at the protein level (Fig. 5C
and Supplementary Fig. S3).
The landscape of AR and RUNX2 occupancy at the SNAI2
locus, derived from the aforementioned ChIP-seq datasets
(3, 33) suggested recruitment of both RUNX2 and AR to a
putative composite enhancer approximately 4-kb upstream of
the SNAI2 TSS (Fig. 5D). ChIP-qPCR analysis of C4-2B/Rx2dox
cells treated with DHT and/or dox conﬁrmed occupancy
as well as mutual enhancement of the RUNX2 and AR recruitment (Fig. 5E and F).

Figure 4. Type II genes are characterized by regions co-occupied by AR and RUNX2. A, C4-2B/Rx2 cells were treated with dox and/or DHT, and RUNX2
occupancy at known AREs of the indicated type I and II genes was measured by ChIP-qPCR (mean  SEM; n ¼ 3). B, Venn diagram showing the overlap
between AR and RUNX2 occupancy based on ChIP-seq datasets publicly available for these two transcription factors (3, 33). These datasets were also
used in C and D. C, AR ChIP-seq peaks adjacent to type I (left) or type II genes (right) were centered and the average local AR (gray) and RUNX2 (black) ChIP-seq
signals were normalized by the total number of AR peaks in each class and the total number of reads in each library. D, AR/RUNX2-doubly occupied ChIP-seq
peaks within 500-kb of the TSSs of type I (open dots) and type II (ﬁlled dots) genes were enumerated in 10 kb windows and expressed as a fraction of
the total number of type I or type II genes. Randomly selected genes were used to compute the background (gray ribbon) TSS-to-peak distances as described
in Supplementary Materials and Methods.

RUNX2 and AR signaling cooperatively induce
invasiveness in a SNAI2-dependent manner
SNAI2 promotes invasiveness and other metastatic properties in various cancers (40). We therefore asked whether
the synergistic stimulation of SNAI2 by AR and RUNX2 in C42B/Rx2dox cells might inﬂuence invasiveness. Coactivation of
RUNX2 and AR induced an elongated cell morphology and
dendrite-like processes (Fig. 6A) often associated with invasiveness and metastasis (41). Matrigel invasion assays
showed that combined AR activation and RUNX2 induction,
but neither alone, led to a remarkable increase in cell
invasiveness (Fig. 6B), and Western blot analysis conﬁrmed
the synergistic stimulation of SNAI2 by AR and RUNX2 under
the conditions employed during the invasion assay (Supplementary Fig. S4). Finally, to test the role of SNAI2 in this
increased invasiveness, we knocked down its expression
using each of two shRNAs (Fig. 6C). Both the morphologic
changes (Fig. 6D) and the synergistic stimulation of cellular
invasiveness (Fig. 6E) in response to DHT and dox were

2862

diminished with shRNA#1, which robustly knocked down
SNAI2 expression. Somewhat weaker diminution of the
invasiveness was observed with shRNA#2, which decreased
SNAI2 expression to a lesser extent. These results indicate
that synergistic stimulation of SNAI2 expression by RUNX2
and androgen signaling is required for the increased invasiveness observed when the two pathways are simultaneously activated.
Strong SNAI2 expression in prostate cancer biopsies with
high nuclear levels of both AR and RUNX2 predicts
disease recurrence
In pursuit of evidence for potential costimulation of
SNAI2 by AR and RUNX2 in a clinical setting, we assessed
immunohistochemical staining expression of the respective
proteins in 95 primary prostate cancer tumors using a tissue
microarray (TMA) representing tumors from 73 patients
who remained free from clinical recurrence and 22 who
relapsed. Consistent with published data (39), most of the

tissue samples were stained for SNAI2 only weakly, but four
sections were assigned the highest SNAI2 histoscore of 3
(Supplementary Table S6). Each of these four sections, for
example, case 1 in Fig. 7A, was also assigned high histoscores
for both RUNX2 and AR (Supplementary Table S6). Reciprocally, absence or low expression of either nuclear RUNX2
or nuclear AR was most commonly associated with low or
lack of detectable SNAI2 (e.g., Fig. 7A, cases 2 and 3,
respectively). Overall, there was a strong correlation
between the SNAI2 histoscore and the sum histoscores for
AR and RUNX2 (r ¼ 0.26, P ¼ 0.003, based on Kendall's t
measure of correlation), with RUNX2 making the major
contribution to the correlation (Supplementary Table S7).
However, a minor yet sizable proportion of the SNAI2negative tumors stained strongly for both nuclear RUNX2
and nuclear AR (Supplementary Table S6), possibly reﬂecting conditions in these cases that limit the transcriptional
activity of RUNX2, AR, or the cooperation between them.
Taken together, the TMA data suggest that, similar to our
in vitro results, cooperation between AR and RUNX2 in
stimulating SNAI2 expression exists in the majority of
human prostate cancer tumors in vivo. In our cohort, how-

www.aacrjournals.org

ever, none of the AR, RUNX2, or SNAI2 histoscores in
isolation signiﬁcantly correlated with disease recurrence
(Fig. 7B).
Because a minority of the tumors did not exhibit evidence for cooperation between AR and RUNX2 in stimulating SNAI2, we asked whether they differed from the
majority of tumors (with evidence of cooperation) in
terms of disease recurrence. Indeed, tumors with evidence
of cooperation (RUNX2high/ARhigh/SNAI2high) recurred
more frequently than those expressing high SNAI2, but
low AR or RUNX2. Association between SNAI2 and recurrence risk was signiﬁcant when RUNX2 and AR were
both high (P ¼ 0.011) but not when either was low
(Fig. 7C and Supplementary Table S8). These results suggest that tumors in which AR and RUNX2 can interact to
stimulate SNAI2 expression are more likely to recur after
resection.

prostate cancer cells was originally investigated in the context

of the osteomimetic properties displayed by these boneseeking tumors (42). More recent studies demonstrate that
RUNX2 stimulates various prometastatic genes and phenotypes that include, but are not limited to such related to the
high predilection of prostate cancer for bone (16, 17). Here
we further demonstrate that RUNX2 modulates activity of
the AR. This modulation primarily entails inhibition of
androgen-stimulated expression of genes, including such
that mediate cellular differentiation and tumor suppression. Examples include inhibition of the NKX3-1 and SPDEF
tumor suppressor genes (43, 44) and the epithelial marker
KRT19 (Supplementary Table S3). However, a small subset
of the AR transcriptome was resistant to attenuation by
RUNX2, and in some cases RUNX2 even augmented the
expression of androgen-stimulated genes. Examples for
these so-called type II genes include the antiapoptotic genes
EGFR, ITSN1, and CRYAB, the pro-proliferative gene PRKCD,
the prometastatic gene SNAI2 and additional genes impli-

cated in various aspects of prostate cancer progression such
as HIPK2, SOX9, and RAB3B (Supplementary Table S4).
Thus, the ectopic expression of RUNX2 during prostate
cancer progression may reshape the androgen response by
attenuating expression of AR-regulated tumor suppressor
genes while sparing and even augmenting expression of
AR–regulated oncogenes.
Attenuation of the androgen response by RUNX2 at most
androgen-stimulated (type I) genes, as well as the reciprocal
attenuation of the RUNX2 response by androgens (Supplementary Fig. S1), are attributable to the direct interaction
between the two transcription factors, demonstrated previously by coimmunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays
(8, 29) and reiterated herein based on colocalization in C42B/Rx2dox cells and alteration to AR intranuclear mobility in
response to RUNX2. Consistent with the involvement of the
respective DNA-binding domains in their physical interaction (8, 29), attenuation of the androgen response after

Diverse AR/RUNX2 Interactions in Prostate Cancer

AR cooperate to induce SNAI2 in
prostate cancer tumors and the

ns, not signiﬁcant.

RUNX2 induction was associated with decreased recruitment of AR to type I genes (this study); and, attenuation of
the RUNX2 response by androgens was associated with
compromised recruitment to its targets (8). In breast cancer
cells, a similar relationship of reciprocal attenuation has
been documented for most RUNX2- and most estrogenresponsive genes (25, 26). Interestingly, however, RUNX2stimulated SNAI2 expression in breast cancer cells followed
the global trend and was attenuated by estradiol, potentially
contributing to the anti-RUNX2 and protective effects
that estradiol had with regard to breast cancer cell invasiveness (20). Unlike in breast cancer cells, the present work
with prostate cancer cells demonstrates that SNAI2 in this
cancer type is subject to an unusual mechanism whereby

www.aacrjournals.org

androgens and RUNX2 signaling cooperate to stimulate gene
expression.
How a minority of AR–stimulated genes, for example, PIP,
PGC (Fig. 2), and SNAI2 (Fig. 5) escape RUNX2-mediated
attenuation remains to be fully elucidated. We observed retention of AR and recruitment of RUNX2 itself to AR–occupied
regions (AROR) near these so-called type II genes (Fig. 4). At
ﬁrst glance, the recruitment of RUNX2 could be interpreted as
tethering to these ARORs via contacting DNA-bound AR.
Arguing against such a tethering mechanism, RUNX2 was
recruited to the doubly occupied regions even in cells not
stimulated by DHT (Figs. 4A and 5E). Furthermore, the doubly
occupied regions near type II genes are enriched for sequence
elements resembling the RUNX consensus motif TGTGGT

(91% contain such a motif, compared with 43% of AR-only
peaks). Our working model therefore suggests that AR and
RUNX2 bind individual elements at composite enhancers of
type II genes, and that proximity between these elements
permits each transcription factors to remain bound in the
presence of the other. We do not know, however, why some
type II genes merely escape attenuation of the androgen
response by RUNX2 (e.g., SGK1; see Supplementary Fig. S5),
whereas others are further stimulated by AR and RUNX2 in
a synergistic manner (e.g., SNAI2). We speculate that certain
spatial conﬁgurations of AR- and RUNX2-binding elements
render composite enhancers of the so-called type IIA genes
exceptionally attractive to coactivators, which promote the
observed transcriptional synergism.
SNAI2 is a major player in cancer metastasis (20, 40).
Knockdown of endogenous SNAI2 in prostate cancer cells
results in reduced expression of mesenchymal markers,
corresponding morphologic changes, and decreased cell
invasiveness (45, 46). In frozen sections of prostate cancer
biopsies, SNAI2 mRNA was higher in microdissected metastatic lesions compared with primary prostate cancer
(39, 47). Recent studies also demonstrated positive correlation between SNAI2 immunohistochemical staining in primary tumors and disease progression (16, 39, 48). The
regulation of SNAI2 by each of AR and RUNX2 has been
independently reported (17, 20, 39), and here we show that
the two regulatory pathways intersect to cooperatively promote SNAI2 expression and prostate cancer cell invasiveness
in vitro. Clinically, we observe that the minority of primary
prostate cancer tumor sections that are strongly immunostained for SNAI2 are typically highly positive for both AR and
RUNX2 nuclear immunostaining; low or no nuclear staining
of either AR or RUNX2 is usually associated with lack of
SNAI2 staining. Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, high SNAI2
expression in our series of primary tumor biopsies correlated
with disease recurrence, but only when it was associated with
strong AR and strong RUNX2 immunohistochemical staining.
These ARhigh/RUNX2high/SNAI2high tumors may represent
an aggressive prostate cancer subtype with a high recurrence rate. In contrast, many tumors where high SNAI2
expression was associated with low AR or low RUNX2 had
low recurrence rates. If ARhigh/RUNX2high/SNAI2high primary tumors were reproducibly found aggressive in additional
patient cohorts, efforts would be warranted to screen for such
patients and develop drugs, for example, AR/RUNX2 disruptors, which may spare them the dire consequences of disease
recurrence.
In conclusion, RUNX2 remodels androgen signaling in
prostate cancer cells in a locus-dependent manner. It usu-

ally attenuates AR–driven transcription, but a minority of
genes remain androgen responsive in the presence of
RUNX2. Some of them, for example, SNAI2, exhibit synergistic stimulation and recruitment of both AR and RUNX2
to composite enhancers. Targeting the AR–RUNX2 interaction presents an opportunity for the development of novel
therapeutic approaches that would retain expression of
androgen-stimulated tumor suppressors while preventing
synergistic interaction between AR and RUNX2 at prostate
cancer–driving genes. Such novel therapeutic approaches
would be particularly suited to prevent disease recurrence
in patients whose primary tumor biopsies exhibit high
expression of AR, RUNX2, and SNAI2.
