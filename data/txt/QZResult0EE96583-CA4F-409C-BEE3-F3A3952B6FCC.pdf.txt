Abstract
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors suppress tumor cell
growth via a broad spectrum of mechanisms, which should
prove advantageous in the context of cancer prevention. Here,
we examined the effect of dietary administration of OSUHDAC42, a novel HDAC inhibitor, on prostate tumor progression in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate
(TRAMP) model. Based on a series of pilot studies, an AIN-76A
diet was formulated containing 208 ppm OSU-HDAC42, which
was estimated to deliver f25 mg/kg of drug per day to each
mouse and found to cause a suppression of PC-3 xenograft
tumor growth equivalent to that achieved by gavage administration of a similar dose. At 6 weeks of age, TRAMP mice
received this drug-containing or control diet for 4 or 18 weeks
and were evaluated for prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN) and carcinoma development, respectively. OSU-HDAC42
not only decreased the severity of PIN and completely
prevented its progression to poorly differentiated carcinoma
(74% incidence in controls versus none in drug-treated mice),
but also shifted tumorigenesis to a more differentiated
phenotype, suppressing absolute and relative urogenital tract
weights by 86% and 85%, respectively, at 24 weeks of age. This
tumor suppression was associated with the modulation
of intraprostatic biomarkers, including those indicative of
HDAC inhibition, increased apoptosis and differentiation,
and decreased proliferation. With the exception of completely
reversible hematologic alterations and testicular degeneration, no significant changes in body weight or other indicators
of general health were observed in drug-treated mice. These
results suggest that OSU-HDAC42 has value in prostate cancer
prevention. [Cancer Res 2008;68(10):3999–4009]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous
cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in men (1).
Prostatic tumors often have a long initial latency period before
becoming pathologically advanced, at which point they are invariably fatal (2, 3). Unfortunately, a consistently deregulated group of

genes critical for malignant progression has not been identified for
this disease (4). These attributes suggest a need to prevent prostate
cancer, such as by chemopreventive agents capable of simultaneously modulating multiple cellular processes involved in prostate
carcinogenesis.
Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are appropriate candidates in this regard because of their ability to selectively induce
apoptosis (5, 6), cell cycle arrest (7–9), and differentiation (10, 11) in
cancer cells. These compounds have shown pleiotropic anticancer
activities in many recent preclinical and clinical investigations of
human cancers, including prostate cancer, through both histone
acetylation–dependent and histone acetylation–independent
mechanisms (10, 12–14). First, and representing the conventional
rationale for their development, HDAC inhibitors induce the
reexpression of growth arrest genes silenced in cancer through
chromatin remodeling (15). Second, HDAC inhibitors modulate a
growing list of nonhistone HDAC substrates including transcription
factors and mediators of cell signaling in cancer cells, the immune
system, and tumor vasculature (12, 16, 17). The paucity of knowledge of HDAC biology, however, has precluded a complete understanding of the anticancer mechanisms of these agents, and the
toxicologic sequelae of chronic therapy are largely unknown (18).
We recently reported our development of a novel phenylbutyrate-based HDAC inhibitor, OSU-HDAC42, and showed its
potent and pleiotropic anticancer activities in models of human
prostate and hepatic cancer in vitro and in vivo (19–24).
Specifically, OSU-HDAC42 induces hallmark indicators of HDAC
inhibition, including histone H3 acetylation, a-tubulin acetylation,
and p21 up-regulation, and modulates regulators of cell survival,
such as Akt, Bcl-xL, Bax, Ku70, survivin, and members of the
inhibitor of apoptosis protein family (19–21, 24). In the present
study, to evaluate these tumor suppressive effects in a chemopreventive context, we extended the use of OSU-HDAC42 to the
transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) model,
which mimics spontaneous tumor progression in man (25). Prostate
lesion development in TRAMP mice is driven by the SV40 large T
antigen (TAg) in the prostate epithelium (26). TAg disrupts cellular
p53 and retinoblastoma functions and is expressed upon activation
of an androgen-response element in the probasin promoter (26).
The ensuing tumorigenesis occurs in an age-dependent, multistage
process, including hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia
(PIN), and adenocarcinoma with distant metastasis (27).
Here, we use an interdisciplinary approach entailing medicinal
chemistry, molecular pharmacology, and veterinary pathology to
assess the chemopreventive potential of OSU-HDAC42 concurrent
with an investigation of whole-body ramifications of chronic
therapy by using TRAMP mice as a model. Based on pilot studies

demonstrating that dietary administration of OSU-HDAC42 suppressed PC-3 xenograft tumor growth, the drug was given via diet
to TRAMP mice to evaluate its inhibitory effects on PIN and prostate carcinoma. Collectively, our results show that OSU-HDAC42
achieves a remarkable suppression of prostate tumorigenesis in the
absence of limiting toxicity.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. The HDAC inhibitors vorinostat (also known as suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid, Zolinza, Merck & Co., Inc.) and OSU-HDAC42 [also
known as (S )-(+)-N -hydroxy-4-(3-methyl-2-phenylbutyrylamino)-benzamide] were synthesized in our laboratory with purities exceeding 99% as
shown by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (300 MHz). OSUHDAC42 (NSC D736012) is a novel hydroxamate-tethered phenylbutyrate
derivative that had been evaluated preclinically by the Rapid Access to
Intervention Development program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI).
Vorinostat is the first HDAC inhibitor to earn U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approval and is marketed for the treatment of
cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (10). AIN-76A rodent diet with and without
208 ppm OSU-HDAC42 was obtained from Research Diets, Inc. Mouse
monoclonal antibodies against various target proteins were obtained from
the following sources: p21 and TAg (Pab 101; Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Inc.), a-tubulin and acetylated (Ac) a-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich), synaptophysin (Dako North America, Inc.), and h-actin (ICN Biomedicals). Rabbit
polyclonal antibodies against various target proteins were obtained from
the following sources: acetylated histone H3 (Ac-H3; Upstate Biotechnology,
Inc.) and Bax, Ki67, cleaved caspase-3, and E-cadherin (Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc.).
Animals. Male NCr athymic nude mice (5–7 wk of age) were obtained
from the NCI and injected s.c. with PC-3 cells, as described (21). Treatment
was initiated 7 d after injection, with the gavage dose of drug adjusted twice
weekly to mirror the dose of drug consumed in the diet. TRAMP mice
(C57BL/6TRAMPxFVB) were generated and housed as previously reported
(28). The reversibility of observed OSU-HDAC42–associated toxicity was
determined in age-matched nontransgenic (wild-type) littermates of
TRAMP mice, which included comparison of weights of the adrenal glands,
brain, epididymides, epididymal fat pads, heart, kidneys, liver, pituitary
gland, spleen, testes, and thymus. The procedures performed were in
accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee of The Ohio State University.
Histopathology. The entire carcass of each animal in all studies was
evaluated for gross lesions and preserved in 10% formalin at necropsy. An
extended set of tissues from representative animals (n = 3, 5, and 10 for the
pharmacodynamic, xenograft, and TRAMP studies, respectively) was
evaluated microscopically in accordance with Society of Toxicologic
Pathology–proposed guidelines for repeat-dosing toxicity studies (29), with
the exception of spinal cord and female reproductive organs. Dorsal (DP),
lateral (LP), ventral (VP), and anterior (AP) prostate lobes, iliac lymph
nodes, liver (left lobe), and lungs from each TRAMP mouse were collected,
fixed, processed, and evaluated as described (28). Testes were fixed for
24 h in Bouin’s fixative and then transferred to 70% ethanol. The observer
scoring the prostate slides (A.S.), via a TRAMP-specific grading scheme (30),
was blinded to the treatment status.
Immunodetection of biomarkers. TRAMP prostate tissue homogenates were prepared and immunoblotted against Ac-H3, p21, Ac-a-tubulin,
a-tubulin, E-cadherin, synaptophysin, Bax, TAg, and h-actin as described
(28). Immunohistochemical detection of Ac-H3, Ki67, cleaved caspase-3,
E-cadherin, and synaptophysin was performed on 4-AM-thick, paraffinembedded PC-3 xenograft tumor, TRAMP prostate, testis, spleen, and/or
bone marrow tissue sections in accordance with the manufacturers’
recommendations.
Statistical analysis. Satisfying the requisites of independence and
normal distribution, a Student’s t test was used to determine if certain
responses (immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry results, xenograft
tumor volumes, body and tissue weights, and microscopic lesion scores and

distributions) were influenced by drug treatment. The incidences of
prostate lesions and metastasis were compared with a m2 contingency
analysis. Differences between groups were considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results
Oral administration of OSU-HDAC42 modulates targets in
TRAMP prostate with higher potency relative to vorinostat. A
series of pilot studies was carried out to identify an optimal dose
and administration route of OSU-HDAC42 in preparation for a
long-term prevention study in TRAMP mice. Considering the effect
of dietary restriction on suppressed tumorigenesis in TRAMP
mice (30, 31), a dose-ranging study was performed to identify a
dosing schedule of OSU-HDAC42 that would not compromise body
weight. Our data indicate that the doses of 25 mg/kg everyday or
50 mg/kg every other day by gavage had no significant effect on
body weight and exhibited no limiting toxicity in TRAMP mice.
However, progressive weight losses were observed at higher doses,
including 40 mg/kg everyday and 65 mg/kg every other day (data
not shown).
To assess the HDAC inhibitory potency of these tolerated doses
of OSU-HDAC42 in vivo, their pharmacodynamic effects vis-à-vis
those of vorinostat on intraprostatic levels of histone H3 acetylation and p21 expression in the DPs of TRAMP mice were
evaluated by Western blotting. Treatment with OSU-HDAC42 at
both doses for 14 days caused greater increases in histone H3
acetylation than vorinostat at 50 mg/kg everyday (P < 0.05). A
similar, but not statistically significant, trend occurred in p21
expression levels between OSU-HDAC42 and vorinostat (Fig. 1A).
Together, these data indicate a higher HDAC inhibitory potency for
OSU-HDAC42 than for vorinostat at these dosing schedules.
Dietary and gavage administrations of OSU-HDAC42 achieve
equivalent suppression of PC-3 xenograft tumor growth. To
avoid repeated gavage-associated stressing of mice, feeding of drug
in the diet represented a preferred route for long-term drug
administration. To examine the feasibility of dietary delivery, the
effect of OSU-HDAC42 given via gavage versus diet on PC-3 tumor
growth in nude mice was assessed. Accordingly, a diet was formulated to contain 208 ppm OSU-HDAC42, a concentration estimated by food consumption measurements to achieve an average
dose of 25 mg/kg/d, which was previously reported to suppress
PC-3 tumor growth when given by gavage (21). PC-3 subcutaneous
xenograft-bearing nude mice were treated with this diet or by daily
gavage (with the gavage dose of OSU-HDAC42 adjusted twice
weekly to mirror that consumed in the diet) for 6 weeks and
analyzed with respect to tumor volume and intratumoral target
modulation.
The tumor growth curves for animals treated with drug in the
diet and by gavage were nearly overlapping (Fig. 1B). Dietadministered and gavage-administered drug equivalently suppressed tumor volumes by 65.6% and 65.3%, respectively, compared
with control animals (respective final volumes of 190 F 17 mm3
and 183 F 29 mm3 versus 424 F 51 mm3 in controls, mean F SE,
P < 0.002). The combined weights of the testes/epididymides were
also comparably decreased by 64.5% and 61.8% in gavage-treated
and diet-treated mice, respectively (101 F 8.4 mg and 108 F 13 mg
versus 284 F 26 mg in controls, mean F SD, P < 0.0001). Equivalent
effects on blood cell counts and serum chemistry were also
observed (data not shown; effects discussed in results of TRAMP
studies below). Dietary drug treatment did not significantly
affect terminal body weight (30.3 F 3.8 g in control mice versus

Cybernetics, Inc.) from 10 randomly chosen 400 fields. The percentages of Ki67-positive and cleaved caspase-3–positive cells were manually counted from

study, mice consumed 3.9 F 0.2 g of diet per day, representing a
28 F 3.3 mg/kg/d dose of OSU-HDAC42 (means F SD).
Suppression of PC-3 xenograft tumor growth is associated
with target modulation by diet-administered OSU-HDAC42.
We previously reported that OSU-HDAC42 modulated a series of
targets governing multiple aspects of prostate cancer cell survival
in vitro and in vivo (21). To link the tumor suppressive activity
of diet-administered OSU-HDAC42 with its effects on relevant
biomarkers, immunohistochemical analyses were performed and
indicate that the drug treatment significantly decreased the proliferation marker Ki67 concurrent with increased staining for Ac-H3
and the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (Fig. 1C and D).
TRAMP mice develop prostatic hyperplasia and PIN at
6 weeks of age. Having confirmed that the dietary administration
of OSU-HDAC42 at 208 ppm was effective and safe in PC-3 tumor–
bearing mice, we assessed its chemopreventive activity in the
TRAMP model. Because TRAMP mice display an early stage of
androgen-driven tumorigenesis by 6 weeks of age (26, 32), treatment was started at this age in our prevention study. The extent of
lesions in prostate tissues of 6-week-old TRAMP mice was
compared with that of age-matched wild-type mice with respect
to urogenital tract (UGT) and prostate lobe weights, and micro-

www.aacrjournals.org

scopic lesion score and intralobe distribution. The weights of
TRAMP UGT and prostate tissue were higher than that of wild-type
mice, and this increase was attributable to epithelial hyperplasia
and PIN, most notably in the DPs and LPs (Fig. 2A; Supplementary
Fig. S1).
OSU-HDAC42 decreases the severity of PIN in TRAMP mice
at 10 weeks of age. PIN represents an opportune intervention
point in man at which an effective therapeutic strategy could
theoretically prevent or slow the progression to carcinoma (33–35).
To assess the ability of OSU-HDAC42 to delay PIN development,
6-week-old TRAMP mice were treated with either control AIN-76A
rodent diet or the diet containing 208 ppm OSU-HDAC42 through
10 weeks of age when control animals are expected to have
developed advanced PIN and a low incidence of carcinoma (25). An
approximate delivery of 19 mg OSU-HDAC42/kg/d to TRAMP mice
over the course of the study was estimated by food consumption
measurements.
PIN remained the most severe lesion in TRAMP mice after
4 weeks of treatment in both groups, with the exception of one
poorly differentiated tumor in a control diet–fed mouse (Table 1).
To ascertain subtle differences in lesion development between
treatment groups, the weights of UGTs and prostate lobes,
and microscopic lesion scores and intralobe distributions were

compared. Figure 2B and C show that OSU-HDAC42 suppressed
the overall severity of PIN lesions as manifested in significant
reductions in the weights of the UGTs and DPs and significant
decreases in the microscopic lesion scores in the LPs and VPs.
The distribution of lesions within each prostate lobe was also
affected, with a trend, as evident in the LPs and VPs and
correlating with the decreased lesion score in these lobes, toward
more normal epithelium and hyperplasia, and less PIN in drugtreated TRAMP mice (Fig. 2D). Seminal vesicle weights were also
decreased by drug treatment [169 F 32 mg in treated mice
(n = 15) versus 193 F 31 mg in control mice (n = 15), mean F
SD, P < 0.05].
OSU-HDAC42 prevents the progression of PIN to poorly
differentiated carcinoma and shifts tumorigenesis to a more
differentiated phenotype in TRAMP mice at 24 weeks of age.
We hypothesized that the suppressive effect of OSU-HDAC42 on
the development of early proliferative lesions in TRAMP mice, as
described above, would retard or prevent progression to long-term
carcinoma. Accordingly, a larger numbers of animals (n = 23, to
account for the expected increase in overall variation in lesion
development in controls with age) were treated from 6 to 24 weeks

of age when the majority of TRAMP mice will have developed
advanced, metastatic tumors (25).
As summarized in Table 1, OSU-HDAC42 completely prevented
the occurrence of macroscopic prostate tumors (78% of controls
versus none in the drug-treated group) and of poorly differentiated
carcinoma (74% of controls versus none in the drug-treated group)
after 18 weeks of treatment. Only 1 of 23 drug-treated TRAMP
mice had evidence of carcinoma microscopically (moderate differentiation). This profound inhibitory effect was reflected in the
86% and 85% reductions in absolute and relative UGT weights,
respectively, in OSU-HDAC42 diet–fed mice relative to the controls.
Specifically, the mean absolute and relative values of control versus
drug-treated UGT weights were 3.1 g versus 0.4 g and 10% versus
1.5%, respectively (Fig. 3A and B; Table 1). The similarity in the
reductions in absolute and relative UGT weights shows that the
antitumor effects occurred independent of an effect on body
weight. Interestingly, the relative UGT weight of drug-treated
TRAMP mice at 24 weeks of age was the same as that of control
TRAMP mice at 10 weeks of age (1.5% of body weight).
Analysis of individual prostate lobes indicates that OSU-HDAC42
caused significant reductions in the weights of the DPs and

microscopic lesion scores of the DPs, LPs, and VPs (Fig. 3B and C).
As manifested in the lesion scores, the breakdown of lesion
distribution by lobe shows that PIN remained the predominant
lesion in the majority of OSU-HDAC42–treated mice at 24 weeks
(Fig. 3D). In addition to the absence of poorly differentiated
tumors, drug-treated mice had significant increases in normal,
hyperplastic, and/or PIN in all prostate lobes compared with
control diet–fed mice. Seminal vesicle weights were also decreased
by drug treatment [274 F 62 mg in treated mice (n = 23) versus
377 F 147 mg in control mice (n = 22); mean F SD, P = 0.01].
Control TRAMP mice developed palpable prostate tumors at
19 F 2.7 weeks of age; the tumors, including urinary bladder,
weighed 3.4 F 2.1 g at the time of sacrifice.
Interestingly, the incidence of adenomas at 24 weeks of age was
greater in drug-treated TRAMP mice (43.5% versus 4.3% of controls;
Table 1), and all adenomas occurred in the DPs (Fig. 3D). These
tumors displayed characteristics consistent with adenoma according
to terminology proposed by the Mouse Models of Human Cancer
Consortium Prostate Pathology Committee (36). They consisted of
focally distinct, intraluminal projections of well-differentiated
epithelium arranged in papillary projections on hypocellular and
nonedematous connective tissue scaffolds (Fig. 4C, bottom left). A
supportive fibrovascular stalk and compression atrophy of adjacent
epithelium were present in some sections. Nuclear and cellular
atypia, mitotic figures, and destructive invasion were lacking. Arising
within a background of PIN, the adenomas generally occupied a
small percentage of total lobe area (8.3 F 2.5%, mean F SE).
To shed light onto the latency of the adenomas after agent
withdrawal, two TRAMP mice were returned to control diet at
24 weeks of age. These mice were sacrificed at 42 weeks of age
with palpable tumors arising in the seminal vesicles that were
determined microscopically to be epithelial-stromal tumors (37).
The prostate lobes were variably expanded by phyllodes-like
tumors (APs, DPs), PIN (VPs), and well-differentiated carcinoma
(LPs) with no evidence of metastasis (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Tumor suppression in TRAMP mice by OSU-HDAC42 is
associated with target modulation and biomarkers of differentiation. Relevant HDAC inhibition-associated and cell survival
biomarkers were assessed in the PIN lesions of TRAMP mice after
treatment from 6 to 10 weeks of age. Drug treatment significantly
altered the proliferation and apoptotic indices in PIN, as shown

www.aacrjournals.org

by immunohistochemical staining of Ki67 and cleaved caspase-3
(Fig. 4A). OSU-HDAC42 induced 2.6-fold and 2-fold increases
(P < 0.01) in the acetylation of a-tubulin and the expression of Bax
compared with controls, respectively (Fig. 4B). An increase in
histone H3 acetylation was also noted, but was not statistically
significant due to greater variation in this biomarker.
The marked disparity in prostate morphology at 24 weeks of age
between the two treatment groups, i.e., poorly differentiated
tumors in controls versus PIN and adenomas in drug-treated mice,
suggested a shift to a more differentiated phenotype in response to
OSU-HDAC42. Whereas this disparity precluded a morphologymatched comparison of biomarkers between treatment groups, an
effort was made to evaluate the expression of biomarkers of
differentiation in representative tissue samples by using immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting analyses. Distinct differences
in the expression levels of E-cadherin and synaptophysin were
noted between the treatment groups, both of which were reported
to be dysregulated with lesion progression in TRAMP mice (25, 38).
In 24-week-old TRAMP mice, OSU-HDAC42 maintained E-cadherin
expression, which was lost in controls, and prevented the
expression of synaptophysin (an indicator of the neuroendocrine
phenotype), which was increased in controls (Fig. 4C and D). The
increased Ac-H3 levels in adenomas confirmed the HDAC
inhibitory effect of OSU-HDAC42 in the prostate (Fig. 4C).
OSU-HDAC42 causes reversible hematologic alterations and
testicular degeneration. Toxicologic effects of OSU-HDAC42 in
TRAMP mice were assessed by hematologic, histopathologic,
and body and organ weight evaluations. There was no significant
difference in the body weight after 18 weeks of treatment [31 F
3.6 g for treated mice (n = 23) versus 29 F 2.7 g for control mice
(n = 23), mean F SD, P = 0.6]. The weights of epididymal fat pads,
measured as an assessment of body fat and additional indicator of
general health, were also not significantly altered [549 F 349 mg in

(i.e., 10 weeks of age), a significant leukopenia, characterized by a
mature neutropenia and lymphopenia, was present, and red cell
numbers were decreased (Supplementary Table S1). All blood cell
counts returned to control levels upon withdrawal of drug in wildtype littermates of TRAMP mice. Femoral and sternebral bone

and proliferative status to controls with all cell types and stages of
maturation present (Supplementary Fig. S3). None of the
hematologic abnormalities observed after 4 weeks of treatment
was noted after 18 weeks of treatment, i.e., 24 weeks of age
(Supplementary Table S1). Extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH)
was increased in the spleens of mice treated for both 4 and 18
weeks, and reversible thymic atrophy, shown by histology and
organ weight data, occurred in association with OSU-HDAC42
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2).
Significant effects on serum chemistry after 4 weeks of treatment
included increased aspartate aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and
albumin and decreased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and cholesterol, all of which, like the blood cell count alterations, returned to
control levels upon discontinuation of the drug. At 18 weeks of
treatment, significant decreases remained in ALP and cholesterol,
as well as decreased potassium and increased protein that seemed
to be due to elevated albumin (Supplementary Table S1).
Other than effects on the prostate, spleen (EMH), and thymus
(atrophy), the only lesion detected by gross or histopathologic
examination was severe testicular degeneration in drug-treated
mice. A marked bilateral reduction in the size of the testes was
noted after 2 weeks of repeated dosing of OSU-HDAC42, but not
with vorinostat (Fig. 5A). Weights of the testes and epididymides

decreased progressively in TRAMP mice after 4 and 18 weeks of
treatment and eventually returned to control levels upon
withdrawal of the drug after each treatment period (Fig. 5C). Mice
were able to achieve litters within 6 to 8 weeks of drug withdrawal
after both 4 and 18 weeks of treatment, and the sizes of these litters
(9 and 11 pups for the first litters of two recovered mice after 4
weeks of treatment and 8 and 13 pups for the first litters of two
recovered mice after 18 weeks of treatment) were estimated to be
normal for their strain background.
Histologically, the seminiferous tubules of drug-treated mice
were devoid of spermatozoa and lined predominantly by Sertoli
cells, spermatogonia, and variable numbers of primary spermatocytes up to the leptotene-zygotene stage. Immunostaining of Ki67
shows that actively dividing spermatogonia remained even after
18 weeks of drug treatment (Fig. 5B). No morphologic abnormalities of the Sertoli or Leydig cells were noted.
Tumor suppression by OSU-HDAC42 in TRAMP mice is not
associated with disruption of large TAg expression. Given the
consistent and marked drug effect on the testes, an effort was
made to determine whether the dramatic suppression of tumorigenesis in TRAMP mice was associated with disruption of TAg
expression or androgen production. Immunoblotting of prostate
tissue homogenates shows that TAg was expressed at similar levels

in OSU-HDAC42 diet–fed and control diet–fed mice both at 10 and
24 weeks of age. Moreover, serum testosterone levels in drugtreated mice were not significantly different from those in controls,
refuting the involvement of altered TAg expression or androgen
production in the suppressive effects of OSU-HDAC42 on tumorigenesis (Fig. 5D).

Discussion
The intensity of efforts to develop HDAC inhibitors for cancer
therapy is reflected by the recent FDA approval of vorinostat (10)
and the current use of at least 10 different HDAC inhibitors in >80
clinical cancer trials.5 Far fewer studies, however, address the
chemopreventive activities of these agents (12). The features of
HDAC inhibitors that underlie their preclinical and clinical
successes to date as cancer therapeutic agents, such as their broad
spectrum of activities against regulators of cellular differentiation,
cell cycle, and apoptosis, as well as their differential toxicity (8, 39)
for transformed cells, also predict favorably for their chemopreventive activity and are especially fitting for the molecularly
heterogeneous and initially latent disease of prostate cancer.
However, lack of full understanding of HDAC biology precludes
the complete mechanistic characterization of HDAC inhibitors
and hinders the prediction of drug-associated toxicity (18). Consequently, this study is aimed at providing insight into both the
chemopreventive efficacy and toxicity of chronic therapy of
OSU-HDAC42 by examining its in vivo effect on tumorigenic and
phenotypic end points in TRAMP mice.
To establish the antitumor efficacy of the dietary administration
of OSU-HDAC42, the in vivo effects of dietary delivery were compared with that of gavage administration in PC-3 tumor-bearing
mice. Despite the presumed differences in the pharmacokinetic
behaviors of OSU-HDAC42 given by these two methods of drug
delivery, the effect on end points of efficacy (PC-3 tumor volume)
and toxicity (testis/epididymis weight, hematologic variables) were,
nevertheless, equivalent. This finding established the feasibility of
dietary administration of OSU-HDAC42 and suggests a desirable
pharmacokinetic feature of the drug, which provides flexibility in
its delivery method in cancer treatment.
Targeting PIN as a method to control prostate cancer was
recently validated by the association of the cancer preventive
activity of finasteride with reduced risk of PIN in the Prostate
Cancer Prevention Trial (35). Similarly, in our study, the suppression of PIN in TRAMP mice by OSU-HDAC42 correlated with a
marked retardation of prostate tumorigenesis. It is noteworthy that
in 24-week-old TRAMP mice OSU-HDAC42 completely inhibited
the occurrence of poorly differentiated carcinoma and suppressed
the relative UGT weight to that of 10-week-old control TRAMP
mice. To our knowledge, this is the most potent chemopreventive
effect achieved by a small molecule agent in TRAMP mice with
documentation of the effects on body weight. The class I HDAC
inhibitor MS-275 induced much smaller reductions in macroscopic
tumor incidence (7 of 10 controls versus 5 of 11 drug-treated
animals) and UGT weights of TRAMP mice treated over an age
interval and with a drug dose similar to those in our study ( from
5–7 to 27 weeks of age and 20 mg/kg/d; ref. 40). Considering
that OSU-HDAC42 affects both classes I and II HDAC substrates

5

http://www.clinicaltrials.gov

www.aacrjournals.org

(20) and that the clinical significance of improving HDAC isoform
selectivity is undetermined (41), these findings support a role
for broad spectrum HDAC inhibitors in prostate cancer chemoprevention.
The high incidence of adenomas in OSU-HDAC42–treated
TRAMP mice is noteworthy. The adenoma phenotype is not
included in the spectrum of lesions described by the founders of
the model (25) and is rarely reported in TRAMP mice by other
investigators. Whereas the mechanistic basis for adenoma
formation in response to drug treatment is uncertain, the
prodifferentiation effects attributed to HDAC inhibitors are
potentially involved. Consistent with this notion are the changes
in E-cadherin and synaptophysin expression observed in representative prostate tissue from control and OSU-HDAC42–treated
TRAMP mice at 24 weeks. Although these adenomas were limited
to the DPs, the reported location of phyllodes-like tumors in
TRAMP mice (25), their morphology was distinctly different from
phyllodes-like lesions in that they contained a scant stromal
compartment. The single phyllodes-like tumor detected in this
study occurred concomitantly with an adenoma in the same DP of
a drug-treated mouse. Whereas these adenomas could be
interpreted to represent a drug-induced alteration of phyllodeslike tumor growth, the coexistence of these lesions suggests they
were unrelated.
The exact cause of OSU-HDAC42–induced testicular degeneration
remains undetermined; however, based on unchanged serum levels
of testosterone and TAg expression in treated TRAMP mice, this
toxicity does not seem to involve disrupted androgen production.
This is an important point because carcinogenesis in the TRAMP
model is initially dependent on androgen to induce TAg expression
through the probasin promoter. Thus, unlike flutamide, which
decreased prostate lesion development in TRAMP mice in association with its antiandrogen activity and suppression of TAg (42),
the potent chemopreventive effects observed in our study are
attributed to the direct effects of OSU-HDAC42 on the prostate. The
sparing of spermatogonia in the degenerative testes of treated mice
correlates well with the reversible nature of the lesion. Because the
leptotene-zygotene spermatocytes are the most progressed cell
types of the spermatogenic cycle remaining in drug-treated testis,
OSU-HDAC42 likely disrupts the successional stage of meiotic
prophase, the pachytene-diplotene primary spermatocytes.
The lack of testicular degeneration in vorinostat-treated mice in
our pilot study shows that this toxicity is not common to all agents
in this class. To our knowledge, the only other report of HDAC
inhibitor–associated testicular degeneration involved trichostatinA (TSA), which was also concluded to target spermatocytes (43).
Although a direct link to testicular HDAC inhibition has not been
shown with TSA or OSU-HDAC42, this association is plausible
given the critical role of HDACs in the control of chromatin
condensation during spermatogenesis (44). Differences in HDAC
isoform selectivity could play a role in this toxicity given the high
expression of HDAC6, against which OSU-HDAC42 and TSA have
potent inhibitory activity (20, 45), in normal testis compared
with other tissues (46). In any event, it should be noted that
OSU-HDAC42 has not been evaluated clinically yet, thus its effect
on human testis is unknown and a conclusion regarding the riskefficacy ratio for this toxicity in man would be speculative at this
time. In fact, the consistent, potent, and reversible effect of OSUHDAC42 on the testes, with sparing of major organ histology and
weight, may warrant its evaluation for the treatment of testicular
cancer.

The transient decrease in circulating blood cells that occurred in
OSU-HDAC42–treated mice without effects on bone marrow
cellularity is different from the myelosuppression observed with
cytotoxic agents currently in clinical use and, as is suspected with
other HDAC inhibitors, suggests a mechanism other than toxicity
to early hematopoietic precursors (47). Compensatory EMH in the
spleens of OSU-HDAC42–treated mice may explain the absence of
leukopenia after 18 weeks of treatment. The significance of these
hematologic alterations, which must be interpreted in light of their
magnitude and in conjunction with all pathology variables and
in-life observations (48), requires further preclinical evaluation and
dose titration to assess potential implications for human patients.
Importantly, no lesions were detected in major organs, either by
histologic assessment or by organ weight evaluation (Supplementary Table S2), including heart, liver, kidney, lung, adrenal gland,
pituitary gland, and brain, that correlated with the hematologic
abnormalities.
In summary, OSU-HDAC42 suppressed the severity of PIN and
completely blocked the progression of PIN to poorly differentiated carcinoma in the TRAMP model. The tumor suppressive
effects were associated with intraprostatic modulation of HDAC
and targets regulating cancer cell survival and differentiation.
These results suggest clinical value in incorporating OSUHDAC42 into the management regimen of patients with PIN.
