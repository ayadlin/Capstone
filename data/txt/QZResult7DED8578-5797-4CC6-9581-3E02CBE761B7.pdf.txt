BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to compare outcomes in patients with anal canal squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) who were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy by either intensity-modulated radiation therapy
(IMRT) or conventional radiotherapy (CRT). METHODS: Forty-six patients who received definitive chemoradiotherapy
from January 1993 to August 2009 were included. Forty-five patients received 5-fluorouracil with mitomycin C (n ¼
39) or cisplatin (n ¼ 6). Seventeen (37%) were treated with CRT and 29 (63%) with IMRT. The median dose was 54
Gy in both groups. Median follow-up was 26 months (CRT) and 32 months (IMRT). T3-T4 stage (P ¼ .18) and
lymph node-positive disease (P ¼ .6) were similar between groups. RESULTS: The CRT group required longer treatment duration (57 days vs 40 days, P < .0001), more treatment breaks (88% vs 34.5%, P ¼ .001), and longer breaks
(12 days vs 1.5 days, P < .0001) than patients treated with IMRT. Eleven (65%) patients in the CRT group experienced
grade >2 nonhematologic toxicity compared with 6 (21%) patients in the IMRT group (P ¼ .003). The 3-year overall
survival (OS), locoregional control (LRC), and progression-free survival were 87.8%, 91.9%, and 84.2%, respectively,
for the IMRT groups and 51.8%, 56.7%, and 56.7%, respectively, for the CRT group (all P < .01). On multivariate analysis, T stage, use of IMRT, and treatment duration were associated with OS, and T stage and use of IMRT were
associated with LRC. CONCLUSIONS: The use of IMRT was associated with less toxicity, reduced need for treatment
breaks, and excellent LRC and OS compared with CRT in patients with SCCA of the anal canal. Cancer

KEYWORDS: anal canal, IMRT, conventional radiation, squamous cell carcinoma, outcomes, toxicity.

Although rare, squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the anal canal provides a paradigm for organ preservation in the management of cancer. The treatment has evolved from the abdominoperineal resection (APR) to sphincter-preserving nonsurgical
therapy with concurrent radiation therapy and chemotherapy.1,2 In addition to the primary tumor, the pelvic and perirectal lymph
nodes also require treatment, leading to irradiation of bowel, bladder, and bone marrow, as well as the external skin and genitalia.
As a result, the risk of acute toxicity is high, often leading to interruptions in radiation and extending the overall treatment time.3
Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), using inverse-planning that varies beam intensities, allows radiation-dose delivery while sparing adjacent normal tissues. IMRT has been extensively studied in other cancers. However, to
date, there are only a few reports on IMRT in the treatment of anal cancer.4-7 Here, we compare the toxicity and clinical
outcome of patients with SCCA of the anal canal treated with IMRT versus conventional radiotherapy (CRT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
We conducted a retrospective review of patients with SCCA of the anal canal who were treated with primary chemoradiotherapy at Stanford Hospital and Clinics between January 1993 and August 2009. The study was approved by the

Stanford Institutional Review Board. Of 72 patients identified, 26 were excluded for having treatment outside
Stanford (n ¼ 14), having metastatic disease (n ¼ 10), or
presenting with recurrent disease (n ¼ 2). Of the remaining 46 patients who formed the cohort of this study, 17
(37%) received CRT (May 1993-April 2002), whereas 29
(63%) received IMRT (June 2003-August 2009). In
2002, there was an institutional shift in treatment paradigm, and IMRT became the standard treatment
technique.
Baseline characteristics of the 46 patients are shown
in Table 1. Overall, the patients in the CRT group tended
to have more advanced local disease (American Joint
Commission on Cancer [AJCC] staging system stage
T3 or T4) compared with patients in the IMRT group,
although this was not statistically significant (47% vs
28%, P ¼ .18). The incidence of lymph node-positive disease and the overall AJCC stage did not differ significantly
between the 2 groups (Table 1). Five patients were human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive (1 in the CRT
group and 4 in the IMRT group).

Conventional Radiotherapy
The median dose to the primary tumor and involved
nodes was 54 Gy (range, 45-62.4 Gy). Two of 17 patients
were treated in the prone position. Most commonly, anterior-posterior/posterior-anterior (AP/PA) ports were used
for the pelvis and inguinal nodes using photons (6 MV to
15 MV). The pelvic nodal volumes included the internal
and external iliac lymph nodes up to lumbar sacral vertebrae L5/S1. A total dose of 30.6 Gy was delivered to the
whole pelvis, followed by a field reduction to the bottom
of the sacroiliac (SI) joint to 45 Gy. In 10 patients, the
dose to the inguinal nodes (range, 36-59.5 Gy) was supplemented by using electrons with energies determined by
the depth of the nodes on the treatment planning computed tomography (CT) scan. One elderly patient had
only the primary tumor irradiated to avoid bowel toxicity.
Six patients were treated with a wide AP field, covering the pelvis and bilateral inguinal nodes, and a narrower
PA field. The divergence was matched to the medial edge
of the inguinal nodal field. The dose to the inguinal nodes
was delivered entirely by the anterior field, and a partial
transmission block was used over the pelvic portion such
that 50% of the pelvic dose at midline was delivered by
the anterior field. Additional boosts to the primary site
were given via AP/PA fields, bilateral arc, 3-field, 4-field,
or 3-dimensional conformal techniques.

Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy
In the IMRT group, patients were simulated in the supine
position, and a treatment planning18fluorodeoxyglucose
positron emission tomography (FDG PET)/CT scan was
performed on a GE Discovery LS PET/CT scanner (GE
Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wisconsin). A high-risk
planning target volume (PTV) was defined as the primary

tumor and gross nodal disease. An intermediate-risk PTV
was defined as the internal iliac inferior to the SI joint, the
perirectal nodes, as well as the high-risk PTV. A low-risk
PTV included the inguinal nodes, the external iliac nodes,
and the internal iliac nodes superior to the inferior edge of
the SI joint. The superior border was L5-S1. The PTV
included a 0.5 cm to 0.7 cm expansion for setup uncertainty. The guidelines for dose prescription evolved over
the study period. Thus, the doses were heterogeneous and
are shown in Table 1. The median dose delivered was
54 Gy (range, 45-59.4 Gy). All treatment planning was
performed on the Eclipse Treatment Planning System
(Varian Medical Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, California).
The current practice is to treat the low-risk PTV to
40 Gy at 1.6 Gy per fraction and the intermediate-risk
PTV to 45 Gy at 1.8 Gy per fraction. The high-risk PTV
is boosted sequentially to an additional 5.4 Gy for T1-2
category tumors or to 9-14.4 Gy for T3-4 stage tumors
or lymph node-positive patients.
Chemotherapy
Forty-five of the 46 study patients received fluoropyrimidine-based concurrent chemotherapy. One patient in the
CRT group did not receive chemotherapy. 5-FU was
given as a continuous infusion in 32 patients (either 1000
mg/m2 on days 1-4 and days 29-32 or 200-225 mg/m2
intravenously daily during radiation therapy) or as oral
capecitabine 825 mg/m2 by mouth over 2 daily doses on
days of radiation in 13 patients. In the CRT group,
14 (82%) patients received concurrent mitomycin C
(10 mg/m2) on day 1 and day 29 and a fluoropyrimidine,
and 2 patients received a fluoropyrimidine alone. In the
IMRT group, 25 (86%) patients received concurrent mitomycin C/fluoropyrimidine, and 4 patients received
induction chemotherapy with cisplatin/fluoropyrimidine.

basis of descriptions from the clinical records, these toxicities were then retrospectively reviewed and graded
according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse events, v.3.0,8 for this
study. After the completion of therapy, patients were followed clinically every 2 months to 3 months for 1 year
and every 3 months to 4 months during years 2 and 3. After year 3, patients were assessed every 6 months. Routine
biopsies were not performed in the absence of persistent
or progressive disease.
Statistics
Baseline characteristics were compared by using the Student t test or chi-square test, as appropriate, with P < .05
as the level of statistical significance. Median treatment
duration and median duration of treatment breaks were
compared by using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test
with P < .05 as the level of significance. The KaplanMeier method was used to determine overall survival
(OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and locoregional
control (LRC). Log-rank analysis determined differences
in proportions. Locoregional failure (LRF) was defined as
clinical sign of progression at the primary site, inguinal
lymph node, pelvic lymph node, or a positive biopsy at
the primary site. Persistent but stable disease at the primary site was not defined as LRF on the basis of clinical
examination alone in the absence of a positive biopsy.
Multivariate analyses were performed by using Cox proportional hazards regression for predictors of survival outcomes, and logistic regression analysis was performed to
identify predictors of acute toxicity. Statistical analysis
was performed with SAS v.9.2 software (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina).

RESULTS
Dosimetric Comparison
CT-based treatment planning became the standard at our
institution in December 1999. After that date, 7 of the 17
patients in the CRT group underwent CT simulation and
treatment planning. Five of the 7 patients’ treatment planning CT scans were available for dosimetric analysis. Five
patients from the IMRT group with identical stage and
similar radiation dose were chosen for dosimetric
comparison.
Follow-up
Patients were monitored at least once a week during radiation, and symptoms and toxicities were recorded. On the

Toxicity
Severe acute toxicities are listed in Table 2. Three patients
in the CRT group and 2 patients in the IMRT group were
unable to complete the prescribed course of treatment. In
the CRT group, 1 patient stopped at 48 Gy of a planned
59.4 Gy because of severe colitis; 1 patient stopped at 50
Gy of a planned 56 Gy because of desquamation but then
suffered a stroke resulting in hemiplegia; and 1 patient
stopped at 45 Gy of a planned 50.4 Gy because of moist
desquamation. In the IMRT group, 1 patient died of septic shock; another patient stopped at 54 Gy of 59.4 Gy
because of complications from coronary symptoms presumed related to 5-FU.

Overall, 17 patients experienced grade >2 acute
nonhematologic toxicity with a significantly higher proportion in the CRT group versus IMRT group (65% vs
21%, P ¼ .003, Table 2). In the CRT group, 5 (29%)
patients experienced grade 3 or 4 gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity including 1 of whom required a 1-month treatment
break. In the IMRT group, 2 (7%) patients experienced
grade 3 GI toxicity. Seven (41%) patients in the CRT
group experienced grade 3 dermatologic toxicity compared with 6 (21%) patients in the IMRT group. One
patient in the CRT group and 2 patients in the IMRT
group had grade 3 GI and dermatologic toxicity. The
proportion of grade >2 hematologic toxicities was similar
in both groups (29% CRT vs 21% IMRT).
On univariate analysis, use of IMRT compared with
CRT significantly decreased the odds of developing a
grade >2 nonhematologic toxicity by 86%. When
controlling for age and tumor size, use of IMRT retained
significance (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 0.04 to 0.644; P ¼ .0099)
Treatment Time and Breaks
The median total treatment duration was significantly
higher in the CRT group versus the IMRT group (57 vs
40 days, P < .0001). Fifteen (88%) patients in the CRT
group required treatment breaks compared with 10
(34.5%) patients in the IMRT group (P ¼ .001). The median treatment break duration was significantly longer in
patients treated with CRT compared with IMRT (12 days
vs 1.5 days, P < .0001). All 15 patients in the CRT group

required treatment breaks secondary to radiation toxicities. In the IMRT group, 3 of the 10 patients had treatment breaks unrelated to side effects from the radiation
therapy: 1 patient underwent a 3-day break secondary to
noncompliance, 1 patient had a 1-day break because of
angina felt to be secondary to capecitabine, and 1 patient
had a 3-day break for a pneumonia.
Clinical Response
Of the 46 patients, 43 had adequate follow-up including
physical examination data to assess clinical response to
treatment. Five (11.6%) patients had a clinically complete
response (CR) by the completion of chemoradiotherapy,
and 19 (44.2%) patients had a CR by the time of first follow-up at 4-6 weeks. In 16 patients, an abnormality on examination persisted for 8 weeks or longer. The median
time to CR was 6 weeks (range, 0-56 weeks). Persistent
abnormalities on physical examination resulted in posttherapy biopsies in 12 (28%) patients: 4 patients had positive biopsies, whereas the remaining 8 patients were negative, 2 in the CRT group and 2 in the IMRT group. The
physical examination never normalized in 3 of the 8
patients with biopsies negative for recurrent disease.
Clinical Outcome
The median follow-up time for the entire cohort was 28
months (range, 3-117 months) and for the CRT and
IMRT groups, it was 26 months (range, 3-117 months)
and 32 months (range, 1-77 months), respectively. At the

time of this analysis, 34 (74%) patients were alive at last
follow-up.
Seven (41%) CRT patients developed a LRF, 5
local and 2 nodal. Of the 2 nodal failures, 1 occurred in
the inguinal region, and 1 was in the pelvis with simultaneous distant metastasis in the para-aortic region.
Two were treated with an abdominoperineal resection,
2 received salvage chemoradiotherapy, and 3 died
shortly after local recurrence. Those patients who were
not salvaged included 1 with advanced HIV with poor
performance status, 1 who suffered a cerebrovascular
accident (CVA) with hemiplegia, and 1 who was placed
on comfort care because of chronic abscess and osteomyelitis at the recurrence site. One patient who had
only the primary tumor treated remained locally controlled at 3 years post-treatment. Two patients in the
IMRT group developed local-only recurrences: 1 treated
with APR and 1 that refused further intervention and
subsequently died.
The 3-year OS in this study was 72% (Fig. 1A).
Median time from completion of chemoradiotherapy to
APR was 9 months (range, 4-26 months). The crude
colostomy rate was 11%, and the overall colostomy-free
survival rate at 3 years was 86% (Fig. 1B). OS (88% vs
52%, P < .01), LRC (92% vs 57%, P < .01), and PFS
(84% vs 57%, P < .01) at 3 years were significantly
higher for patients undergoing IMRT compared with
CRT (Fig. 2A-C). Patients who did not have a treat-

3346

ment break had superior 3-year OS, LRC, and PFS
regardless of which type of radiotherapy was used (90%
versus 45%, P ¼ .03; 95% versus 67%, P ¼ .02; 89%
versus 63%, P ¼ .04, respectively).
Table 3 summarizes the Cox-proportional hazards
analyses for OS, LRC, and PFS. Multivariate
analysis identified T stage, use of IMRT, and treatment
duration as independent predictors of OS. T stage and use
of IMRT were independent predictors of LRC. T stage
and treatment duration were independent predictors of
PFS.
Dosimetric Comparison of 3D Versus IMRT
Normal tissue sparing was improved with IMRT (Fig. 3),
with mean bowel volume above 35 Gy reduced by 27%
(228 mL vs 311 mL, P ¼ .02) and mean bowel volume
above 45 Gy reduced by 80% (10 mL vs 52.8 mL, P ¼
.13). IMRT reduced dose to the perineum with mean proportions of perineal volume above 30 Gy and 40 Gy of
40.8% and 23.6%, respectively, compared with 66.8%
and 60.1% in the CRT group (P ¼ .17 and .10,
respectively).

anal canal,9-11 the acute and late toxicities of treatment
with standard pelvic radiotherapy can be significant.12 In
the RTOG 98-11 randomized trial, a 74% rate of grade
3-4 nonhematologic toxicity was reported for the overall
cohort.13 In addition, patients in the mitomycin C arm
had a 61% rate of grade 3-4 hematologic toxicity. The
current study aimed to determine whether IMRT could
reduce treatment toxicity and improve outcome for anal
cancer patients by comparing IMRT patients to a group
treated with CRT from a single institution. To our knowledge, this is the first article to directly compare nonIMRT with IMRT in this disease site from a single
institution.
Salama et al have previously reported on IMRT in a
pooled experience from the University of Chicago and
Mayo Clinic on 53 patients. In that study, with a median
follow-up of 14.5 months, the investigators found that
37% of patients experienced grade 3 dermatologic toxicity
and 15% experienced grade 3 GI toxicity.7 In a study by
Pepek et al from Duke University, 47 patients were
treated with IMRT with a median follow-up of 14
months. Their study reported that no patients with SCCA
of the anal canal experienced grade 3 dermatologic toxicity. However, 16% did experience grade 3 GI toxicity
(Table 2).6 Although significant, both of these studies

3348

have toxicity rates that compare favorably with those from
RTOG 98-11. Ultimately, the results of the RTOG 0529
phase 2 trial will provide prospective data on rates of acute
toxicity in patients treated with IMRT and concurrent 5FU/mitomycin C.
Our study had a median follow-up that was twice as
long as previously reported studies (32 months for IMRT
patients). Our results confirmed reduced toxicity rates
compared with those reported in RTOG 98-11. When
compared with a cohort of patients treated with CRT
from the same institution, we found significantly reduced
rates of grade 3-4 acute nonhematologic toxicity. Table 3
shows how the current series compares to prior studies.
Also noteworthy is the finding that, in the current study,
even when higher doses were delivered in the IMRT
group to the regional nodes (Table 1), treatment toxicity
was still reduced. This finding further highlights the
advantage of IMRT for dose escalation to improve outcome without increasing treatment toxicity.
An important limitation within this study is that
fact that, despite the use of a standardized toxicity grading
scale, significant subjectivity existed in retrospectively
grading toxicity during treatments. As a result, the objective measurement of treatment breaks, duration of treatment breaks, and overall treatment time were also

examined. The results showed that the reduction in toxicity was associated with a decrease in treatment breaks
(34.5% vs 88%, P ¼ .001), reduced treatment break duration (12 days vs 1.5 days, P < .0001), and an overall
reduction in treatment time (57 vs 40 days, P < .0001).
Salama et al reported that 41% of patients treated with
IMRT required treatment breaks,7 whereas Pepek et al
reported treatment breaks in 18%,6 both of which are
consistent with the current study. As a caveat, it must be
noted that although these numbers are objective, the decision to give a treatment break is far from objective, and
different physicians will invariably have different thresholds at which to offer a break. It is likely that given the
awareness of the detrimental effects of interrupting radiation, especially in disease sites such as the head and neck,
and cervix,14-18 physicians are less willing to offer breaks
due to toxicity.
Dosimetrically, we found that IMRT enhanced
normal tissue sparing. Our dosimetric results coincide
with the findings of other investigators.5,19,20 This
improvement in normal tissue sparing appears to have
lead to reduced grade 3 or 4 nonhematologic toxicities in
the IMRT group compared with the CRT group.
Outcome
The median time to complete clinical response was 6
weeks, and only 12% of patients had complete response at
the end of therapy. The length of time before complete
regression was a maximum of 56 weeks. Findings from
other series have demonstrated similarly long regression
times. Cummings et al reported a range of 2-36 weeks for
complete clinical tumor response.21 Similarly, Schlienger
et al found a mean time to complete regression of 3
months, with the longest extending to 1 year.22
These results support continued observation of persistent
abnormalities at the completion of chemoradiation,
because regression will continue. It is our policy to observe
patients with frequent clinical examinations unless signs
of progression are noted, at which point biopsy and additional workup are pursued. It is less clear how to manage
patients with persistent abnormalities that neither
improve or worsen. In this study, 4 of 12 patients with
persistent abnormal clinical examination findings had
positive biopsies. Imaging studies such as FDG PET
could be helpful in assessing residual active disease.
We found improved 3-year OS (88% vs 52%, P <
.01), LRC (92% vs 57%, P < .01), and PFS (84% vs
57%, P < .01) in the IMRT group compared with the
CRT group. These excellent outcomes are similar to those

reported by the other IMRT studies. Indeed, the outcomes in the CRT groups are worse than historical
results.10,11,13 Although there was no significant difference in TNM stage between the 2 groups, the CRT group
had a trend toward more T3-4 disease (47% vs 28%, P ¼
.18), which could have impacted local control. However,
the percentages of N+ patients (29% CRT vs 24%
IMRT) and overall stage I-II patients (53% CRT vs 66%
IMRT) were similar. The chemotherapy regimen was
similar as well.
Whereas IMRT should not be dosimetrically superior to CRT in terms of target coverage, the advantage
with IMRT is likely that it can reduce overall treatment
time by decreasing normal tissue doses resulting in significantly reduced toxicity and treatment duration, thereby
possibly improving outcome. In this study, we found that
prolonged treatment times and interruptions in treatment
were associated with poorer outcomes, similar to previous
reports.11,23-26 However, other studies have shown that
treatment breaks have not been associated with worse disease control or survival.27,28 A recent pooled data analysis
of 937 patients treated on RTOG 87-04 and RTOG 9811 provides more insight on the role of treatment time.29
This analysis found no correlation between duration of
radiation therapy and local control. Conversely, total
treatment time (stratified as 53 days vs >53 days),
which was prolonged particularly in the subset of patients
from RTOG 98-11 that received neoadjuvant chemotherapy, was associated with higher local failure and colostomy rates. Although this study strongly suggests that
neoadjuvant chemotherapy can have a detrimental effect
on disease control, presumably by delaying chemoradiation and allowing accelerated repopulation and chemotherapy resistance, delays during chemoradiation may be
of less importance. This study offers some reassurance
that treatment breaks during radiotherapy may be given
without a significant impact on treatment outcome. However, it should be noted that in our patient population,
none of whom received induction chemotherapy, the median treatment duration for patients in the CRT group
was 57 days compared with 40 days for the IMRT group,
while the median RT time in the RTOG pooled analysis
was 45 days. Given the finding of worse local control with
total treatment duration of >53 days in the latter study,
the large disparity in treatment time between the IMRT
and CRT groups in the current study could still have
partly contributed to the differences in outcome. Therefore, we believe that caution should still be applied when
allowing prolonged breaks.

Certainly technical factors could have contributed
to the differences in outcome. First of all, we observed
that relatively few patients were treated during the CRT
time period (17 patients over the course of 10 years). Perhaps the experience of the treating physician could have
impacted the quality of the treatment delivered.
Second, the CRT patients were treated during an
earlier time period before the widespread use of PET or
image-guided radiotherapy to account for setup uncertainty. It is possible that PET-based treatment planning in
IMRT patients could have identified previously undetected regions of disease involvement, allowing proper
dose delivery.
Finally, in addition, the dose delivery to the pelvic
nodes differed. In the CRT group, the upper pelvic nodes
received <40 Gy in 76% of patients compared with 38%
in the IMRT group. Also all IMRT patients, with 1
exception, received 45 Gy to the lower pelvic nodes versus
only 59% of CRT patients. These dose differences might
have led to better disease control in the IMRT group.
Indeed, 2 nodal failures were observed in the CRT group
compared with none seen in the IMRT group. However,
one was an inguinal nodal failure, and the other had simultaneous pelvic and para-aortic failures. Currently,
there is no evidence that doses higher than 36 Gy are
needed for these elective nodal regions. We, therefore, do
not believe differences in dose or using PET-based planning had a significant impact in the locoregional outcomes difference. However, we believe further studies on
the optimal dosing for anal canal cancer and the use of
PET for treatment planning are necessary.
Even though this study has the inherent limitations
of being retrospective with small patient numbers and
potential imbalances in prognostic factors, our results
support further investigation of IMRT for this disease
site. The results of RTOG 0529 are awaited to provide
survival data in a group of patients treated prospectively
with IMRT. Although outcomes are generally excellent,
locoregional failure remains a problem, particularly for
larger tumors, and dose escalation could be used selectively in those at higher risk. In addition, given the
potential morbidity of treatment IMRT could significantly diminish toxicity and improve the therapeutic ratio. Longer follow-up is needed to accurately determine
late effects with this relatively new technique.

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, our study shows that the use of IMRT is
associated with less nonhematologic toxicity and reduced

3350

need for treatment breaks compared with CRT in patients
with SCCA of the anal canal. Locoregional control and
survival for patients treated with IMRT compare favorably with historical data.
