Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) activity is critical for prostate cancer
progression. Overexpression of several AR-associated coactivators has been shown to be essential for AR activation during
disease progression. The stimuli and signaling pathways
leading to overexpression of these coregulators, however,
remain largely elusive. Here, we investigated whether androgen signaling, which demarcates critical transitions during
prostate cancer disease progression, can affect coregulator
expression. We found that expression of four and a half LIM
domain protein-2 (FHL2), a key AR coactivator that is
overexpressed in prostate cancer and associates with a poor
prognosis, is induced strongly by androgens. Androgen
induction of this coactivator established a feed-forward
mechanism that robustly activated the AR. Stimulation of
FHL2 after androgen exposure was time- and dose-dependent
and relied on the presence of a functional AR. Androgen
induction of FHL2 depended on active transcription of the
FHL2 gene, mediated by action of serum response factor (SRF)
on its proximal promoter. Loss of SRF, a transcription factor
that preferentially regulates the expression of genes involved
in mitogenic response and cytoskeletal organization, hampered prostate cancer cell proliferation. These results suggest
a novel indirect mechanism of androgen action on FHL2
expression and provide evidence that SRF is an important
determinant of AR action in prostate cancer cells. [Cancer Res

Introduction
Androgen receptor (AR) activity is critical for prostate cancer
cell proliferation throughout disease progression. In the androgenstimulated locally advanced or metastatic stages of the disease, AR
action is targeted by antiandrogen therapy (1). Moreover, despite
their resistance to androgen ablation therapy, the AR is emerging
as an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of androgen
depletion independent (ADI) prostate cancers (2–4). Aberrant
activity of the AR in prostate cancer has, at least in part, been
attributed to overexpression of several AR-associated coactivator
proteins. Expression and activity of AR coregulators, as well as the
AR itself, are currently under investigation as potential targets for
therapeutic intervention (5, 6). The factors and signaling pathways
responsible for overexpression of AR transcriptional regulators in

prostate cancer cells, however, remain largely elusive. Resolving the
cues that drive expression of these coregulators will be essential to
fully understand the mechanism of AR activity in prostate cancer
and to generate insights needed for novel therapeutic approaches.
As androgen signaling demarcates critical transitions in prostate
cancer progression (7), we investigated whether the androgenic
milieu of prostate cancer cells could exert an effect on coactivator
expression, using the key AR coactivator four and a half LIM (FHL)
domain protein-2 (FHL2) as a candidate coactivator model (8).
FHL2 is a member of a subclass of LIM domain–only proteins
that consist of FHLs. LIM domain–containing proteins typically
fulfill roles in cytoskeleton organization and transcriptional control
(9). FHL2 has been shown to bind to integrins and is found in focal
adhesions (10). FHL2 also possesses an intrinsic transactivation
domain, but displays no DNA-binding activity, and functions as a
coregulator for several transcription factors, including the AR (8).
Moreover, FHL2 interacts with several AR-associated coactivators
(10–12). Expression of FHL2 is enriched in prostate epithelial cells,
where FHL2 colocalizes with the AR. FHL2 expression is increased
in prostate adenocarcinoma cells when compared with benign
epithelial cells. Moreover, the nuclear content of FHL2 increases
with prostate tumor dedifferentiation where it is predictive of
prostate cancer recurrences (13, 14).
Here, we show that androgens substantially induce the
expression of FHL2 in prostate cancer cells, establishing a feedforward mechanism that results in robust AR activation. Investigation into the molecular machinery underlying androgen
regulation of FHL2 led to the identification of a novel indirect
mechanism of androgen action in which the effects of androgens
on FHL2 are mediated by serum response factor (SRF). Our data
are the first to indicate that SRF, a ubiquitously expressed
transcription factor that regulates transcription of genes involved
in cellular proliferation as well as cytoskeletal organization (15),
plays an important role in prostate cancer cell survival.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. LNCaP and C4-2 cells were purchased from the American
Type Culture Collection and UroCor, respectively. LNCaP and C4-2 cells
were cultured in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 9%
fetal bovine serum (FBS; Biosource), 100 units/mL streptomycin, and
0.25 Ag/mL amphotericin B ( fungizone; Invitrogen). The LNCaP subline
LNCaP-Rf was generated and maintained as described (16). Cells were
maintained at 37jC in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. LNCaP
cells between passages 29 and 40 were used. In experiments assessing the
effects of androgen treatment, cells were seeded in medium containing 9%
charcoal-stripped serum (CSS), 100 units/mL streptomycin, and 0.25 Ag/mL
amphotericin B. For small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection studies,
antibiotics were left out of the culture medium.

Androgen Induction of FHL2 by Serum Response Factor

Figure 1. Androgens stimulate the expression of FHL2,
resulting in a feed-forward mechanism that ensures robust
AR activation. A, LNCaP cells were treated with 5 nmol/L
of the synthetic androgen R1881 (black columns ) or
ethanol vehicle (gray columns ) for 48 h. RNA was isolated
and converted into cDNA. Real-time PCR was done
using FHL2-specific primers. FHL2 mRNA levels were
normalized with the values obtained from GAPDH
expression. FHL2 mRNA levels are expressed as relative
expression values, taking the value obtained from cells
treated with vehicle as 1. Columns, mean values obtained
from three independent experiments; bars, SE (top ).
Total protein extracts were prepared and Western blotting
was done using an antibody directed against FHL2.
To assess loading differences, the blot was stripped
and reprobed with an antibody directed against h-actin
(b-act; bottom ). B, model for the proposed feed-forward
mechanism: Androgen induction of FHL2 ensures
robust AR transcriptional activity. C, LNCaP cells
were transfected with siRNAs targeting FHL2 or
nonspecific control siRNAs (Control ). Forty-two hours
after transfection, cells were treated with 5 nmol/L R1881
or ethanol vehicle. Forty-eight hours later, FHL2, PSA,
TMPRSS2, and KLK2 expression was evaluated by
real-time RT-PCR as described. Values represent
relative fold induction of mRNA expression after R1881
treatment and correspond to the means and SE of
triplicate samples of a representative experiment (first
and second column ). LNCaP cells were transfected with
an expression construct encoding FLAG-tagged FHL2 or a
control vector. Forty-two hours after transfection, cells
were treated with R1881 (5 nmol/L) or vehicle. After 48 h,
cells were harvested and FHL2, PSA, TMPRSS2, and
KLK2 expression was evaluated as described. Relative
fold induction of mRNA expression was calculated and the
values obtained from one representative experiment were
used to adjust the values of control conditions shown in
column 1 (column 3 ). Values represent relative fold

Tris-HCl (pH 6.9), 10% glycerol] was pipetted onto the culture dish. Cell
lysates were boiled for 5 min and stored at 20jC until analysis.
Western blotting. Equal amounts of protein were loaded onto 10% BisTris NuPAGE gels (Invitrogen) and electrophoresis was done according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose
membranes (Bio-Rad). Blots were reprobed with antibodies against h-actin
to evaluate potential differences in protein loading.
siRNA transfection. LNCaP cells were seeded at a density of 1.6  106 in
100-mm culture dishes in phenol red–free RPMI 1640 supplemented with
9% FBS. The next day, cells were transfected with 500 pmol siGenome
SMART pool directed against FHL2, AR, or SRF (Dharmacon); 500 pmol of a
non-targeting control SMART pool; or mock transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
In experiments assessing the effects of androgens, 36 to 48 h after
transfection, medium was removed and cells were washed once with
medium containing 9% CSS. Fresh medium supplemented with 9% CSS was
added to the cells and cells were treated with R1881 or ethanol vehicle for
the indicated periods of time.
Transient transfections. For experiments using promoter-reporter
constructs, LNCaP cells were seeded in 60-mm culture dishes at a density
of 5  105 per dish in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 9% CSS. The next day,
transfection mixtures were prepared. For each dish, 3 Ag of promoter
reporter construct and 100 ng of TK-Renilla were added to 2 mL serum-free
medium. After addition of 9 AL TransFast transfection reagent (Promega),
the transfection mixture was incubated for 15 min at room temperature.
Cells were washed with serum-free medium, the transfection mixture was
added, and cells were incubated for 30 min at 37jC. Four-milliliter CSS-

supplemented RPMI medium were added. The next day, medium was
replaced and cells were treated with R1881 or vehicle for 2 days. Cells were
washed with PBS and lysed in 500 AL passive lysis buffer (Promega).
Aliquots (10 AL) of cleared lysate were analyzed for luciferase activity using
a Dual Luciferase Assay (Promega).
For experiments using siRNA and siRNA-resistant expression constructs,
LNCaP cells were transfected by means of electroporation. Cells (3  106)
were suspended in 350 AL of medium containing 9% FBS and mixed with
50 AL of a DNA mixture consisting of 10 Ag of expression construct and
80 pmol of siRNA. The cell/DNA mixture was subjected to a 310 V electrical
pulse for 10 ms in 4-mm gap cuvettes using a BXT ElectroSquare
electroporator. Cells were plated in medium supplemented with 9% FBS.
The next day, the medium was replaced. For experiments assessing the
effect of androgens, 24 h later, cells were washed once with medium
containing 9% CSS, fresh CSS medium was added, and cells were treated
with R1881 or vehicle. Two days later, cells were harvested and processed
for RNA and protein isolation as described. Parallel experiments in which a
green fluorescent protein expression construct was transfected showed
transfection efficiency of 70% or more. A detailed description of all
constructs used can be found in Supplementary Data.
RNA isolation. At the time of cell harvest, cells were washed with PBS
and harvested in TRIzol solution (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Real-time reverse transcription-PCR. cDNA was prepared from 2 or
3 Ag total RNA using a SuperScriptIII first-strand synthesis system
(Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was done using SYBR Green PCR mastermix

The primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Glyceraldehyde-3phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) control primers were purchased from
Applied Biosystems.
Cell proliferation assay and bromodeoxyuridine incorporation
assay. LNCaP cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at a density
of 4.5  104 per well in their regular medium without added antibiotics. The
next day, cells were transfected with siGenomeSMART pools directed
against SRF or a control SMART pool as described. Twelve to 16 h later, the
medium was changed. At the indicated time points, cell proliferation was
assessed by means of a CellTiter 96 Aqueous One solution cell proliferation
assay (Promega) or a Cell Proliferation ELISA (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Values from five wells were measured per
treatment group for each time point.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Cells were seeded at a density
of 3  106 in 150-mm dishes in medium supplemented with CSS. Two
days later, cells were treated for 16 h with R1881 or ethanol vehicle. One
percent formaldehyde was added and cells were incubated at 37jC for
10 min. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped on ice in PBS
with Complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics), and pelleted
for 4 min at 2,000 rpm at 4jC. The cell pellet was used in chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. A detailed description of the procedure
used can be found in Supplementary Data. The primers used for PCR
amplification of PSA gene fragments were described before (18). For FHL2
gene amplification, the primers used were 5¶-GAAAGGAGCCCTGGCAAACAAAGG-3¶ ( forward primer, FHL2 promoter), 5¶-CTCGAGAAACCCCGCCGTGTCATT-3¶ (reverse primer, FHL2 promoter); FHL2 5¶-GGTACCCGCAAGATGGAGTA-3¶ ( forward primer, non-specific FHL2 gene fragment),
5¶-CTCATAGCAGGGCACACAGA-3¶(reverse primer, non-specific FHL2 gene
fragment).

Results
Androgen treatment induces FHL2 expression, ensuring
proper AR transcription. To explore whether changes in
androgen concentrations affect FHL2 expression, androgenresponsive LNCaP prostate adenocarcinoma cells were seeded in
androgen-depleted medium and cultured in the presence or
absence of the synthetic androgen R1881 (methyltrienolone) for
2 days. Whole-cell lysates were prepared, and FHL2 protein and
mRNA expression levels were evaluated by immunoblotting and
real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, androgen exposure led to a
marked increase in FHL2 expression, both at the mRNA and
protein levels. Because FHL2 functions as a coactivator for the AR,
these results suggest the existence of a feed-forward mechanism in
which androgens, through up-regulation of a positive regulator of
their cognate receptor, ensure strong activation of androgenresponsive genes (Fig. 1B). To test this hypothesis, the effect of
changes in FHL2 expression on full androgen induction of a set of
endogenously expressed target genes containing well-characterized
androgen response elements (ARE) in their promoter regions
(Fig. 1C) was examined. To this end, LNCaP cells were transfected
with siRNAs targeting FHL2 expression or non-targeting control
siRNAs. Forty-two hours after transfection, when FHL2 levels had
declined substantially in cells exposed to FHL2-specific siRNA
(data not shown), cells were treated with R1881 or vehicle. Fortyeight hours later, a 40% to 50% decline in androgen responsiveness
of the genes encoding PSA, TMPRSS2, and KLK2 was noted in cells
where FHL2 expression was targeted (Fig. 1C). In keeping with

Androgen Induction of FHL2 by Serum Response Factor

Figure 3. Androgen induction of FHL2 depends on active transcription from
a 145-bp proximal promoter fragment. A, LNCaP cells were treated for 30 min
with actinomycin D (ActD ; 5 Ag/mL) or vehicle. R1881 (1 nmol/L; black columns )
or ethanol vehicle (gray columns ) was added. At the indicated time points, FHL2
expression was assessed by real-time RT-PCR as described. Columns, mean
values from samples in triplicate; bars, SE. B, LNCaP cells were transiently
transfected with reporter constructs driven by a 1,570- or 145-bp FHL2 promoter
fragment (FHL2-1570 and FHL2-145). The next day, cells were treated with
5 nmol/L R1881 (black columns ) or ethanol (gray columns ). Forty-eight hours
later, reporter gene activity was determined. Columns, mean values from
samples in triplicate; bars, SE.

these data, forced overexpression of FHL2 further increased the
level of androgen induction of this set of androgen-regulated genes
above that observed for control cells (Fig. 1C). The magnitude of
this effect, however, was not as pronounced as the extent of the
decrease observed after FHL2 knockdown. These data suggest that
the increase in FHL2 expression induced by androgen stimulation
is already sufficient to achieve full AR activity. The effect of the
transfections on FHL2 expression levels is shown in Fig. 1D.
Androgen induction of FHL2 is mediated by an indirect
mechanism that is dependent on SRF. To gain further insight
into this phenomenon, the androgen-mediated induction of FHL2
expression was characterized in more detail. A time course was
done in which LNCaP cells were treated with R1881 for up to 72 h.
Androgen stimulation of FHL2 expression was first seen 16 h after
treatment, became more pronounced after longer periods of
treatment, and reached a maximum at 48 h (Fig. 2A). In untreated
cells, basal FHL2 levels steadily declined over this time course.
These observations were consistent at both the mRNA and the
protein levels. It is noteworthy that PSA mRNA levels increased
after 4 h of androgen exposure (data not shown). These data
suggest that FHL2 induction proceeds through an ARE-independent, and therefore indirect, mechanism of androgen action. Dose
response studies with R1881 concentrations ranging from 1 pmol/L
to 1 Amol/L showed a slight induction of FHL2 levels at 0.1 nmol/L
R1881 with a maximum response at 10 nmol/L R1881 (Fig. 2B). To
assess the involvement of the AR in the observed effects, LNCaP
cells were treated with R1881 in the absence or presence of an
excess of the antiandrogen Casodex (bicalutamide). Addition of
Casodex alone exhibited no effect on FHL2 expression in LNCaP
cells. In combination with R1881 (1 nmol/L) however, Casodex
(10 Amol/L) counteracted the up-regulation of FHL2 (Fig. 2C).
Similar effects were observed when AR expression was targeted.
For example, siRNA-mediated loss of AR expression slightly

www.aacrjournals.org

lowered basal expression levels of FHL2 and prevented androgen
stimulation of FHL2 (Fig. 2D). Consistent with these findings,
androgen treatment of the AR-negative prostate cancer cell lines
PC-3 or DU-145 had no effect on FHL2 expression (data not
shown). Because the subcellular localization of FHL2 has been
shown to be regulated by several stimuli (10), the effect of
androgen exposure on the cellular distribution of FHL2 was
examined. Cells were transfected with an expression construct
encoding FLAG-tagged FHL2 or a control vector. The next day, cells
were treated with R1881 or vehicle control. After 2 days,
immunocytochemistry was done using an antibody directed
against the FLAG tag. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, FHL2
staining was observed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus.
Consistent with a role for FHL2 in cytoskeletal organization (10),
immunoreactivity was enriched in cellular extrusions and cell-cell
contacts. The presence of androgens did not induce notable
changes in this expression pattern. Similar results were obtained in
experiments assessing the cellular distribution of endogenously
expressed FHL2 (data not shown). Control experiments in which a
non-specific antibody was used or the primary antibody was
omitted failed to produce a signal (data not shown). These data
suggested that androgens do not alter the subcellular localization
of FHL2.
To further resolve the molecular mechanism(s) underlying
androgen induction of FHL2 expression, the possibility that
androgens affect transcription of the FHL2 gene was explored. To
this end, LNCaP cells were pretreated for 30 min with the
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. Subsequently, R1881 or
ethanol vehicle was added. Sixteen and 24 h later, cells were
harvested, and FHL2 mRNA expression levels were evaluated.
Treatment with actinomycin D decreased basal levels of FHL2 and
completely prevented androgen induction of FHL2 expression at
both time points (Fig. 3A), suggesting that active transcription
might be involved. To further explore this hypothesis, an f1.6-kb
FHL2 promoter fragment flanking exon 1 (19) was cloned into the
pGL3 basic vector. LNCaP cells transiently transfected with this
promoter-reporter construct (FHL2-1570) were treated with R1881
or control vehicle for 48 h. Androgen treatment induced reporter
gene activity f12-fold (Fig. 3B), a magnitude of response similar to
the fold induction of FHL2 mRNA levels after androgen stimulation
(Figs. 1 and 2). To further delineate the androgen-responsive
domain(s) within this DNA region, progressive 5¶ deletions of
f200 bp were introduced in this fragment. Transient transfection
studies with these deletion constructs revealed that full androgen
responsiveness was maintained in a 145-bp proximal promoter
fragment (Fig. 3B). Promoter-reporter constructs containing
genomic fragments of intermediate size were equally androgen
responsive, with basal reporter gene activity fluctuating moderately
(data not shown). The use of transcription factor search algorithms
(MatInspector and WebSignal Scan Program) and visual inspection
failed to detect the presence of AREs within this 145-bp FHL2
promoter fragment. Thus, our cumulative data suggest that
androgens regulate FHL2 expression through a mechanism that
is different from that of an AR-ARE interaction on the FHL2 gene
promoter.
A search for other candidate genomic regions that could
potentially mediate the effects of androgens on FHL2 expression
revealed the presence of a [CC(A/T)6GG] (CArG) box within the
145-bp sequence (Fig. 4A). CArG boxes are consensus binding sites
for SRF, a widely expressed transcription factor with functions in
cell proliferation and cytoarchitecture (15). Because FHL2 has been

identified as a SRF target gene (20), and reports from other
laboratories suggest that some CArG-box–containing genes could
be androgen responsive (21–23), the possibility that this CArG box
could be involved in mediating the androgen induction of FHL2
was explored. To this end, a site-directed mutagenesis approach
was used to introduce mutations in the CArG box sequence that
would prevent binding of SRF (Fig. 4A). These mutations led to a
decrease in basal levels of reporter gene activity and completely
abolished androgen responsiveness of the 145-bp FHL2 promoter
fragment. Similar results were obtained after mutation of the CArG
box in the 1,570-bp FHL2 promoter reporter construct, and after
cotransfection of wild-type and CArG box mutant FHL2 promoterreporter constructs with an AR expression construct in ARnegative PC-3 prostate cancer cells (data not shown). To verify
binding of SRF to this FHL2 proximal promoter region, ChIP
experiments were done. LNCaP cells were seeded in androgendepleted medium. After 2 days, the medium was replaced and cells
were grown in the presence or absence of R1881. Sixteen hours
later, cells were harvested and ChIP analysis was done using
antibodies directed against SRF and AR or non-targeting antibodies. These experiments confirmed binding of SRF to the
endogenous 145-bp FHL2 promoter fragment, both in the presence
and absence of androgens (Fig. 4B). Consistent with our previous
results, AR recruitment to this genomic region was not observed,
whereas binding of AR to ARE III (18) of the PSA gene was readily
apparent. Control experiments done with non-specific antibodies
or primer pairs amplifying non-relevant genomic sequences

produced no signals (Fig. 4B). To corroborate the involvement of
SRF in the androgen regulation of FHL2, the effect of loss of SRF
expression on androgen induction of endogenous FHL2 expression
was investigated. LNCaP cells were transfected with siRNAs
targeting SRF expression or non-specific control siRNA. Forty-two
hours later, cells were exposed to androgens or vehicle. Two days
later, whole-cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western
blotting. As shown in Fig. 4C, SRF-targeting siRNAs inhibited SRF
expression. Suppression of SRF expression reduced the stimulatory
effects of androgens on FHL2 expression, confirming its involvement in androgen regulation of the FHL2 gene. Moreover, rescue of
SRF expression by a siRNA-resistant SRF expression construct
(SRFsr#1; Supplementary Fig. S2) restored androgen induction of
FHL2 expression. These effects were not due to changes in basal
FHL2 levels upon loss of SRF expression, because knockdown of
SRF did not affect mRNA levels of FHL2 under androgen-deprived
conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3). Likewise, changes in SRF
expression levels did not affect AR expression levels (data not
shown). The androgen induction of the SRFsr#1 construct can be
attributed to its transcription from the pSG5 vector. Importantly,
loss of SRF expression also prevented full androgen induction of AR
target genes. Whereas its effect on the androgen regulation of the
TMPRSS2 gene was rather modest, decreased SRF expression
severely compromised the androgen induction of the genes
encoding PSA and KLK2 (Fig. 4D). Taken together, these data
support the existence of a novel indirect mechanism of androgen
action wherein the regulation of FHL2 is mediated by SRF.

C4-2 cells were comparable with those observed in the LNCaP line.
In androgen-deprived LNCaP-Rf cells, FHL2 expression was f30%
lower than in the parental cells. To determine the involvement of
SRF in FHL2 expression in these cell lines, cells were transfected
with siRNAs targeting SRF or control siRNAs. Four days later, RNA
was isolated from the cells and real-time RT-PCR was done. In line
with the findings described above (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S3),
loss of SRF led to a decrease in FHL2 expression in androgensupplemented LNCaP and C4-2 cells, but did not affect FHL2
expression in LNCaP-Rf cells (Fig. 6B). To evaluate the requirement
of FHL2 and SRF for LNCaP-Rf cell proliferation, LNCaP-Rf cells were
transfected with siRNAs targeting these genes or non-targeting
control siRNAs. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTS assays. As
shown in Fig. 6C, loss of FHL2 expression led to modest decreases
in cell growth. This effect was first seen 48 h post-transfection.
Importantly, targeting the expression of SRF severely hampered
LNCaP-Rf cell proliferation (Fig. 6C). Taken together, these data
indicate that FHL2 and SRF are critical for prostate cancer cell proliferation throughout disease progression and suggest the involvement of additional mechanisms that may be independent of the
presence of androgens in the regulation of FHL2 expression.

Discussion
SRF activity is critical for prostate cancer proliferation. To
our knowledge, these data are the first to identify a role for SRF as a
determinant of androgen action in prostate cancer. To further
investigate the importance of SRF function in prostate cancer, the
requirement of SRF for prostate cancer cell proliferation was
examined. LNCaP cells seeded in serum-containing culture
medium, which contains physiologic levels of androgens, were
transfected with siRNAs targeting SRF or non-targeting control
siRNAs (Fig. 5A). This approach led to a successful knockdown of
SRF and a concomitant decrease in FHL2 expression (Figs. 5A
and 6B; data not shown). At the indicated time points after
transfection, cell proliferation was evaluated by measuring
metabolic activity with a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium (MTS) assay.
Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cell proliferation had already
decreased in cells transfected with SRF-targeting siRNA. MTS
measurements 72 and 96 h after transfection showed a progressive
impairment of cell growth (Fig. 5B). This decrease was not due to
increased apoptosis because the cleavage pattern of the apoptotic
marker poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase was not altered (data not
shown). Instead, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporation studies confirmed a decrease in cell proliferation upon loss of SRF
expression. In line with the MTS data, this effect was observed
48 h post-transfection and increased with prolonged exposure
of the cells to SRF-specific siRNA (Fig. 5C). Interestingly, similar
effects on cell proliferation were observed when expression of
FHL2 was targeted (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To explore the importance of FHL2 expression and its regulation
by SRF in the progression of prostate cancer, experiments were
done using the ADI LNCaP sublines C4-2 and LNCaP-Rf. The C4-2
cell line was derived from a second-generation LNCaP xenograft
from castrated mice (24) and is grown in medium supplemented
with FBS. LNCaP-Rf cells were generated in our laboratory by
culturing LNCaP cells under androgen-deprived conditions (16).
The LNCaP-Rf line is maintained in medium supplemented with
CSS. First, FHL2 expression levels in these cell lines were assessed

Tight regulation of transcription is critical for normal development, and deregulation of transcription by aberrant expression or
activation of components of the transcriptional machinery
contribute to pathologies (25–31). In the case of prostate cancer,
overactivation of the AR results in disease progression and has
been attributed at least in part to overexpression of several of its
coactivators (5, 6). Both the AR and AR coregulators have been
intensely studied as promising therapeutic targets for the
treatment of this disease. Unraveling the signaling events
responsible for overexpression of these cofactors as well as the
cues triggering such signaling may suggest novel therapeutic
avenues. Here, we investigated the regulation of FHL2, an AR
coactivator that is overexpressed in prostate cancer and correlated
with poor prognosis (8, 13, 14). We show that androgens induce
FHL2 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Because
changes in FHL2 expression have a marked effect on the extent of
androgen stimulation of several ARE-driven target genes, these
observations enhance our understanding of the means by which
androgen stimulation elicits robust activity of the AR in prostate
cancer cells. It is tempting to speculate that such a feed-forward
mechanism plays an important role in normal androgen-regulated
physiology as well. For example, FHL2-deficient mice have been
shown to suffer from osteopenia. Similarly, increased bone mass is
seen in a transgenic mouse model where FHL2 is overexpressed in
mature osteoblasts (32). Given that AR function is necessary to
maintain bone mass and protect against osteoporosis (33), these
observations suggest a similar FHL2-dependent regulation of AR
activity in bone. Preliminary findings suggest that, although FHL2
might play a role in the regulation of its own basal gene expression,
its presence is not required for androgen induction of FHL2 gene
expression (Supplementary Fig. S5).
Mechanistic studies showed that androgens exert their effect on
the FHL2 gene through a novel indirect mechanism of action
mediated by SRF. By means of indirect mechanisms of action,
androgens affect the expression of genes that do not contain AREs.

factor is a prime example of an indirect mechanism of androgen
action as this conveys androgen regulation to the expression of
target genes of the affected transcription factor that lack AREs
(34, 35). In the setting of prostate cancer, an overwhelming amount
of data support a central role for the AR in the progression of the
disease (5). However, target genes that are directly affected by AR
signaling via AREs that mediate the effects of AR activity on cell
proliferation and metastasis are only starting to emerge (36). Thus,
identification of SRF, a transcription factor that preferentially
controls the expression of genes involved in mitogenic responses
and cytoskeletal organization (15, 37), as a determinant of
androgen action is particularly interesting because this can have
major implications for our understanding of prostate cancer cell
proliferation and invasive potential. Supporting this possibility, our
data show that loss of SRF hampers prostate cancer cell
proliferation. Flow cytometry data assessing the effect of SRF
silencing on cell cycle progression corroborated these findings.1
Thus far, the mechanism of SRF-dependent FHL2 expression has
been observed in androgen-supplemented LNCaP cells, their ADI
derivative C4-2 cell line, and following transfection of an expression
construct encoding the AR into AR-negative ADI PC-3 cells (data
not shown). In androgen-deprived ADI LNCaP-Rf and LNCaP cells,
loss of SRF expression does not lead to a decrease in FHL2
expression. Nonetheless, both FHL2 and SRF remain important for
LNCaP-Rf cell proliferation, suggesting that other means of action
and of regulation of these proteins contribute to prostate cancer
proliferation.
It will be important to ascertain if androgen regulation can be
generalized to CArG-box–containing genes other than FHL2.
Reports from other laboratories suggest that this is the case for

1

the muscle lineage genes a-actin and c-actin (21–23). Studies
investigating the full extent of the overlap between genes making
up the SRF target genes, the so-called CArGome (15), and genes
subject to androgen regulation are ongoing in our laboratory.
Another question that will be important to answer relates to the
exact mechanism by which androgen and SRF signaling pathways
intersect to regulate transcription of CArG box–containing genes.
SRF constitutively binds as a dimer to CArG boxes in target genes.
The activity of SRF and transcription of its target genes is
controlled either by signaling pathways that converge on SRF and
modulate its activity or by alterations in the composition of the
cofactor complex it engages (15, 37, 38). Consistent with this
method of action, our findings show that SRF is recruited to the
FHL2 promoter even in the absence of androgens. Moreover, our
data suggest that androgens do not affect SRF expression levels.
A recent report using an in vitro assay system suggested that the
AR could be recruited by SRF to a 20-bp DNA fragment harboring
a CArG box and that, through this recruitment, SRF imparts
androgen regulation to the skeletal a-actin gene in C2C12 myoblasts (23). As shown in Fig. 4B, the results of our ChIP
experiments argue against recruitment of the AR as a cofactor
for SRF at the FHL2 CArG box. These observations are consistent
with ongoing ChIP-on-chip studies mapping genome-wide recruitment of the AR.2 In keeping with these findings, coimmunoprecipitation experiments in our laboratory have failed to detect
interactions between endogenously expressed SRF and AR in
LNCaP cells.1 The possibility that androgen-regulated cofactors
that functionally and structurally interact with SRF (21, 39), or
androgen-induced changes in signaling pathways that affect SRFmediated transcription, could be responsible for androgen

Androgen Induction of FHL2 by Serum Response Factor

regulation of SRF signaling is currently under investigation in our
laboratory.
In summary, we show that the expression of the AR coactivator
FHL2 is stimulated in an AR- and androgen-dependent manner
in prostate cancer cells. This finding provides insights into the
regulation of FHL2 overexpression in prostate cancer and identifies a
mechanism by which the AR is able to assure its aberrant activity
in the progression of this disease. The identification of SRF as a
mediator of androgen action on the FHL2 gene establishes the
existence of a novel indirect mechanism of androgen action and
provides the first indication that SRF action is important for prostate
cancer survival.
