Abstract
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women
worldwide, yet successful treatment remains a clinical challenge.
Ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, has recently been
characterized as a potential anticancer agent due to observed
antitumor effects. However, the molecular mechanisms involved
remain poorly understood. Here, we report a role for ivermectin in
breast cancer suppression by activating cytostatic autophagy both
in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, ivermectin-induced autophagy in breast cancer cells is associated with decreased P21-

activated kinase 1 (PAK1) expression via the ubiquitinationmediated degradation pathway. The inhibition of PAK1 decreases
the phosphorylation level of Akt, resulting in the blockade of the
Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. In breast cancer xenografts, the
ivermectin-induced cytostatic autophagy leads to suppression of
tumor growth. Together, our results provide a molecular basis for
the use of ivermectin to inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer
cells and indicate that ivermectin is a potential option for the
treatment of breast cancer. Cancer Res; 76(15); 4457–69. 2016 AACR.

Introduction

poor (3), highlighting the need for the development of potential therapeutic agents.
Autophagy is a self-degrading process characterized by formation of double-membrane autophagosomes, which sequester
excess or defective organelles and fuse with lysosomes for degradation of enclosed materials (4). Although constitutively active
in cells, autophagy can be stimulated in response to multiple
cellular stresses, such as nutrient shortage, hypoxia, and oxidative
stress. In the scenario of tumor development, autophagy eliminates the source of cellular damage and protects the cells from
stress induced by chemotherapy or radiation, which represents a
ﬁne mechanism of negative feedback regulation. However, in the
recent decade, it has become apparent that the consequence of
autophagy varies signiﬁcantly under different circumstances
(5, 6). To date, cytoprotective, cytostatic, cytotoxic, and nonprotective autophagy have been proposed as the four main functional
forms of autophagy in the context of anticancer therapy (7).
Cytoprotective autophagy serves as a survival mechanism to
promote the nutrient cycle (8), which theoretically can be inhibited to achieve therapeutic advantage by sensitizing cells to
anticancer agents (9). Subsequent studies on autophagy in cancer
cells revealed the anticancer properties of autophagy, leading to
the discovery of cytotoxic autophagy, cytostatic autophagy, and
nonprotective autophagy (6, 7, 10). In view of current clinical
efforts to exploit autophagy as a therapeutic target for cancer
treatment, the multiple roles of autophagy underscore the necessity to understand the mechanism of autophagy and the regulatory signaling pathways involved in cancer cells (11).

Avermectin was initially puriﬁed by Drs. Campbell and Omura
(12), and implicated as an efﬁcient agent against parasites, which
earned a Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine in 2015. Subsequently, ivermectin, an avermectin derivative, was chemically
modiﬁed and found to be a more effective compound against a
variety of parasites (13). Recently, ivermectin has been identiﬁed
as a promising anticancer agent for colon cancer, ovarian cancer,

Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer among women and
ranks as the ﬁfth leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide with more than 1.67 million people diagnosed annually,
with over 522,000 deaths per year (1). Although surgical
resection, in combination with radiotherapy when necessary,
affords curative treatment for early or local disease, approximately 70% patients with advanced breast cancer require cytotoxic chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, biologic therapy, or
combinations of these (2). Despite the diverse strategies that
have been proposed to improve the current situation, the
prognosis for patients with advanced breast cancer still remains

tumor growth remain to be further elucidated.
In this study, we show that ivermectin inhibits the growth of
breast cancer by stimulating autophagy. Ivermectin promotes
ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PAK1, which results in
the blockade of the Akt/mTOR signaling, and thereby activates
autophagy in breast cancer cells. These ﬁndings demonstrate a
novel link between ivermectin and the autophagy machinery,
indicating that the use of ivermectin as an autophagy inducer may
constitute a new therapeutic approach for breast cancer.

immunobloting with the indicated antibodies. The identity and
the suppliers of the antibodies are provided in Supplementary
Methods.
Measurement of cell viability
The short-term effects of ivermectin on tumor cell growth were
assessed using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma) assay, as described previously
(6). The long-term effects of ivermectin on tumor cell proliferation were analyzed with a colony formation assay as described in
Supplementary Methods.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture
Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435, HS578T, 4T1,
and HEK 293T cell lines were purchased from the ATCC. MCF-7,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, and MDA-MB-361 cell lines were
kindly provided by Prof. Qiang Yu (Genome Institute of Singapore, Singapore). All cell lines were cultured according to the
ATCC guidelines and used within 6 months. The last time of
authentication was between December 2015 and February 2016
using the short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. Cells were maintained in DMEM or RPMI1640 supplemented with 100 U/mL
penicillin (Sigma), 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Sigma), and 10%
serum (Biowest) in a humidiﬁed incubator at 37 C under 5% CO2
atmosphere.
Animal models
Female NOD/SCID and Balb/c mice at 8 weeks of age were
purchased from HFK Bioscience Co., Ltd (Beijing). All studies
were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Treatment
Committee of Sichuan University. For the orthotopic breast
cancer model, 1  106 MDA-MB-231-GFP cells were suspended
in PBS and engrafted in the mammary fat pad of NOD/SCID mice.
For the syngeneic model, 1  106 4T1 cells were suspended in PBS
and injected subcutaneously into Balb/c mice. When the tumor
volumes reached 100 mm3, mice were randomized into two
groups receiving 0.1 mL of vehicle (10% ricinus oil) or 0.12 mg
ivermectin/mouse/day, respectively. Vehicle or ivermectin was
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) on the ﬁrst 10 days. Mice were
euthanized for analysis after three weeks. Tumor tissues were
isolated and frozen in liquid nitrogen or ﬁxed in 10% formalin
immediately.
Breast cancer patients
All clinical breast cancer tissues were obtained from West China
Hospital (Chengdu, P.R. China) with the approval of the Biomedical Ethics Committee. A total of 20 patients with breast
cancer who underwent radical mastectomy were involved in this
study. Tumor samples from these patients were collected for
immunohistochemical analysis. Detailed clinicopathologic features including age, gender, and clinical stage were listed in
Supplementary Table S1.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Cells were lysed with RIPA buffer supplemented with protease
and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma, p8340). For immunoprecipitations, whole cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 C with 1 mg of the indicated antibodies, followed by addition of protein A-Sepharose beads (40 mL,

BrdUrd labeling assay
The bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) labeling assay was performed in 96-well plate using the BrdU Cell Proliferation Assay
Kit (Roche). After ivermectin treatment, 10 mmol/L BrdUrd was
added to each well, and the cells were incubated for 12 hours at
37 C. The BrdUrd signaling was determined using a Multiscan
MK3 ELISA reader (Thermo Scientiﬁc) at 450 nm.
TUNEL assays
Cells were plated on glass coverslips in 24-well plates, ﬁxed in
4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma), following incubation with ivermectin for 24 hours. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining was performed using the
DeadEnd Fluorometric TUNEL system (Promega). Two 40 ﬁelds
of cells were imaged to evaluate the TUNEL-positive cells per
coverslip in every independent experiment.
Flow cytometry
Cells were harvested and washed once with PBS, and then
resuspended in PI/Annexin-V solution (KeyGEN Biotech) for
apoptosis analysis. At least 10,000 live cells were analyzed on a
FACSCalibur ﬂow cytometer (Becton Dickinson). Data were
analyzed by using FlowJo software.
Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy was performed as described
previously (6). Brieﬂy, MCF-7 cells were ﬁxed in 4% glutaraldehyde (Sigma). A sorvall MT5000 microtome (DuPont Instruments, MT5000) was used to prepare ultrathin sections after
dehydration. Lead citrate and /or 1% uranyl acetate were used
to stain the sections, and the autophagic vacuoles in the cytoplasmic area were calculated using Image Pro Plus version 3
software.
RT-PCR analysis
RNA was prepared using TRIzol (Invitrogen). cDNA was prepared from 1 mg of total RNA, using reverse transcriptase and
random hexamers from RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit
(Fermentas). The PAK1 primers are available in Supplementary
Methods.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical analysis was performed as described
previously (18). The immunostaining intensity (A) was indicated
by four grades (0, negative; 1, weakly positive; 2, positive; 3,
strongly positive) and the proportion of staining-positive cells (B)
was divided into ﬁve grades (0, < 5%; 1, 6%–25%; 2, 26%–50%; 3,
51%–75%; 4, > 75%). The ﬁnal score was calculated as A  B.

Ivermectin Induces Cytostatic Autophagy

Images were captured using a DM2500 ﬂuorescence microscope
(Leica).
Immunoﬂuorescence
Cells were ﬁxed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30
minutes, washed three times with PBS and exposed to PBS
containing 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5% BSA for 30 minutes. The
slides were then stained with antibody against LC3 at 4 C overnight, and subsequently incubated with Alexa Fluor 488–conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Molecular Probes) at 37 C for 1 hour.
Nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342 (Cell Signaling Technology). Images were captured using a confocal laser scanning
microscopy (Zeiss).
Acridine orange staining
Evaluation of autophagy by acridine orange staining was performed as described previously (5). Brieﬂy, cells were treated with
or without ivermectin at indicated concentrations for 24 hours,
and then stained with 1 mmol/L acridine orange (Sigma-Aldrich)
in PBS containing 5% FBS at 37 C for 15 minutes. Cells were
washed and then observed under ﬂuorescence microscopy.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 6. Statistical
differences were determined using a two-sample equal variance
Student t test. Data were deemed to be statistically signiﬁcant if P <
0.05. Error bars indicate SEM unless otherwise indicated.

Results
Ivermectin inhibits breast cancer growth both in vitro and in vivo
To ascertain the anticancer effect of ivermectin in breast cancer
cells, the MTT assay was conducted to assess the growth of six
breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468,
MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435, and HS578T) and a nontumorigenic human breast cell line (MCF-10A) following ivermectin
treatment. As shown in Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S1A,
ivermectin treatment for 24 hours markedly decreased the cell
viability of breast cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner,
while the IC50 value in MCF-10A cells was much higher than those
in breast cancer cells. Consistently, ivermectin signiﬁcantly suppressed cell proliferation in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, as
evidenced by reduced clonogenic survival (Fig. 1B). In addition, a
signiﬁcantly lower percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells was
observed in ivermectin-treated cells compared with controls (Fig.
1C). Collectively, these results demonstrate that ivermectin inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells in vitro. Apoptosis is a
major form of cell death induced by chemotherapeutic agents
(19). To determine whether ivermectin induces apoptosis in
breast cancer cells, we evaluated the apoptotic rate using both
TUNEL and ﬂow cytometry assays (doxorubicin or cisplatin was
used as positive control; refs. 20, 21). Ivermectin treatment for 24
hours showed no obvious effect on apoptosis in either breast
cancer cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, MDA-MB361, MDA-MB-435, and HS578T) or breast epithelial cells
(MCF-10A; Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1B–S1D). This was
further supported by equivalent levels of cleaved caspase-3 in
ivermectin-treated cells and control cells (Supplementary Fig. S1E
and S1F). Of note, apoptotic induction, albeit at a relatively low
level, could be observed with the prolonged treatment of ivermectin till 48 hours, in all the breast cancer cells examined

(Supplementary Fig. S1G). Taken together, our data indicate that
short-term treatment (i.e., 24 hours) of ivermectin displays a
profound antiproliferative effect on breast cancer cells, while such
a growth inhibition is independent of apoptosis.
To evaluate the effect of ivermectin on breast cancer cell growth
in vivo, we employed an orthotopic breast cancer model by injecting
human MDA-MB-231-GFP cells subcutaneously into the mammary fat pad of NOD-SCID mice. As shown in Fig. 1E, xenografts
treated with ivermectin grew at a slower rate than those treated with
placebo. Macroscopically, the size of control tumors was much
larger than that of ivermectin-treated tumors (Fig. 1F). Consistently, tumor weight was reduced in ivermectin-treated mice compared
with that of the control group (Fig. 1G). To conﬁrm the change in
proliferation status of tumors, xenografts were stained for Ki67,
which is used clinically to assess the proliferative fraction in breast
cancer (22). All control xenografts displayed stronger Ki67 staining
than that of ivermectin-treated mice (Fig. 1H). Futhermore, we
observed similar results in a syngeneic model using subcutaneous
injection of 4T1 cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A–S2D). Taken
together, these data suggest that ivermectin inhibits the growth of
breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo.
Ivermectin stimulates autophagy in breast cancer cells
As increasing evidence has highlighted the important roles of
drug-induced autophagy in anticancer therapies (6, 23), we investigated whether ivermectin regulated autophagy in breast cancer
cells. We ﬁrst evaluated the effect of ivermectin on the formation of
the autophagosome membrane by detecting the conversion of
LC3-I to lipidated LC3-II, and the distribution of endogenous LC3
puncta, two classical markers of autophagy (24). Ivermectin treatment resulted in marked autophagy induction as evidenced by
increased LC3-II conversion (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A)
and LC3 puncta (Fig. 2B). However, no apparent difference in LC3II conversion was detected between ivermectin-treated cells and
controls in MCF-10A cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Cells were
also stained with acridine orange to detect the formation of acidic
vesicular organelles (AVO), a characteristic of autophagy (24). As
shown in Fig. 2C, abundant cytoplasmic AVO formation was
readily observed in ivermectin-treated cells. To further corroborate
ivermectin-induced autophagy, the appearance of double-membraned autophagosomes was investigated by transmission electronic microscopy. As shown in Fig. 2D, there was a signiﬁcant
accumulation of autophagosomes/autolysosomes in ivermectintreated cells but not in control cells. In addition, mouse xenografts
were stained with LC3 to clarify whether ivermectin could induce
autophagy in vivo. As shown in Fig. 2E and Supplementary Fig. S4A,
ivermectin-treated xenografts displayed stronger LC3 staining compared with the control group. Consistently, a similar tendency was
observed in LC3-II conversion in ivermectin-treated tumors (Fig. 2F
and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Taken together, these data indicate
that ivermectin stimulates autophagy in breast cancer cells both in
vitro and in vivo.
The expression levels of Beclin 1 and Atg5, two autophagyrelated proteins (24), were then examined to clarify whether
ivermectin promoted autophagosome formation. As shown
in Fig. 2A, ivermectin promoted the expression of both Beclin
1 and Atg5 in a dose-dependent manner. To explore the mechanism by which ivermectin induces autophagy, we next investigated whether ivermectin could induce the formation of autophagosome by enhancing the interaction of Beclin 1 with positive
regulators such as Atg14L and Vps34, and diminishing the

As shown in Fig. 3A, ivermectin treatment increased coimmunoprecipitation of Beclin 1 with Vps34 or Atg14L, respectively.
Conversely, cells treated with ivermectin showed decreased coimmunoprecipitation of Beclin 1 with Bcl-2 (Fig. 3B). Silencing the

Autophagy is involved in ivermectin-inhibited cell proliferation

To determine whether autophagy was involved in the anticancer effect of ivermectin, cells were transfected with Beclin 1
siRNA or Atg5 siRNA followed by treatment with ivermectin.
Cell growth was assessed by MTT assay, BrdUrd labeling, and

of either Beclin 1 or Atg5 signiﬁcantly restored cell growth in
ivermectin-treated cells. Consistently, similar results were
obtained by inhibition of autophagy using wortmannin or
chloroquine (Fig. 4D), indicating that ivermectin-inhibited
breast cancer cell growth was autophagy dependent. In addition, combinatorial treatment of wortmannin or chloroquine
with ivermectin showed no obvious effect on apoptosis induction in breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus, these
ﬁndings suggest that ivermectin-induced autophagy is cytostatic in breast cancer cells, and suppression of autophagy may
attenuate the anticancer effect of ivermectin.

resulted in inhibition of the Akt/mTOR pathway, as evidenced by
decreased phosphorylation levels of Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, and 4EBP1. To determine whether the Akt/mTOR pathway is involved in
ivermectin-induced autophagy, we transfected a constitutively
active form of Akt (CA-Akt) to restore ivermectin-induced Akt/
mTOR inhibition (27). Akt activation signiﬁcantly reduced LC3-II
conversion and LC3 puncta accumulation in ivermectin-treated
cells (Fig. 5B–D), suggesting that the Akt/mTOR pathway is an
important mediator in ivermectin-induced autophagy in breast
cancer cells.
Ivermectin induces autophagy through the blocking
PAK1/Akt/mTOR axis
To further investigate the mechanism underlying ivermectininduced autophagy, we identiﬁed the Akt-interacting proteins
using a previously constructed global protein–protein interaction
network (Supplementary Fig. S8A; ref. 28). Intriguingly, among

these proteins, PAK1 has been reported to be a potential target of
ivermectin (15). In addition, PAK1 is associated with phosphorylation of Akt (29). These observations suggest that PAK1 might
be involved in ivermectin-induced autophagy through regulation
of Akt/mTOR pathway. It has been reported that PAK1 is abnormally expressed in a variety of tumor cells and accociated with
tumor cell proliferation and invasiveness (30, 31). Our data
showed that the basal levels of PAK1 in breast epithelial cells
(MCF-10A) were signiﬁcantly lower than that in breast cancer
cells (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435,
HS578T, and MDA-MB-468; Supplementary Fig. S7B). In addition, ivermectin treatment showed no notable effect on the
expression of both PAK1 and p-Akt in MCF-10A cells (Supplementary Fig. S7C), while in breast cancer cells, ivermectin
treatment decreased PAK1 expression in a dose-dependent
manner (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7A). Following on
from this, we examined the phosphorylation levels of Akt in

K11R; K29R; K39R; K148R; K162R; K256R). E, HEK 293T cells were cotransfected with Flag-tagged ubiquitin and PAK1-HA (WT; KO; Lys11, Lys29, Lys39, Lys148, Lys162,
or Lys256 only) as indicated.

PAK1 knockdown or PAK1-overexpressing cells, respectively, to
validate whether PAK1 regulates the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S8B and S8C, knockdown of
PAK1 decreased Akt phosphorylation, while enforced expression
of PAK1 promoted Akt phosphorylation. To explore the mechanism by which PAK1 promotes Akt phosphorylation, we performed a molecular docking calculation of Akt binding conformation (Supplementary Fig. S8D). The results indicated that
PAK1 could interact with Akt directly, which was further corroborated by coimmunoprecipitation analysis (Supplementary Fig.
S8E). Moreover, we found that this interaction was reduced in
ivermectin-treated cells (Supplementary Fig. S8E), suggesting that
ivermectin regulates Akt/mTOR signaling by interfering with the
interaction between PAK1 and Akt in breast cancer cells.
To further evaluate the role of PAK1 in ivermectin-induced
autophagy, LC3 lipidation and LC3 puncta were assessed in PAK1
siRNA–transfected breast cancer cells followed by treatment with
or without ivermectin. PAK1 knockdown resulted in LC3 lipidation (Supplementary Fig. S9A) and LC3 puncta accumulation
(Fig. 6B), while ivermectin treatment failed to induce further
lipidation of LC3 in PAK1 siRNA–treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S9A). In contrast, PAK1 overexpression suppressed ivermectin-induced LC3 lipidation and accumulation of endogenous LC3

and GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig. 6C and D and Supplementary Fig. S9B).
Consistently, control xenografts showed stronger phosphorylated
Akt and PAK1 staining compared to that in ivermectin-treated
xenografts (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S4C and S4D).
Accordingly, immunoblot analysis displayed an apparent attenuation of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated mTOR, and PAK1
in tumors from ivermectin-treated mice compared with controls
(Fig. 6F). Furthermore, we assessed the clinical relevance of the
PAK1/Akt axis and LC3 in breast cancer patient tissues (n ¼ 20). As
expected, PAK1 expression was positively correlated with p-Akt
and negatively correlated with LC3, respectively (Fig. 6G and H).
Together, our results indicate the PAK1/Akt/mTOR axis as a crucial
pathway of ivermectin-induced autophagy in breast cancer.
Ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PAK1 results in
autophagy activation in breast cancer cells
To gain insights into the mechanism underlying the regulation
of PAK1 by ivermectin, we used reverse transcription PCR (RTPCR) analysis to quantify the mRNA level of PAK1. As shown
in Fig. 7A, ivermectin treatment showed no obvious effect on
PAK1 mRNA level, suggesting that transcription regulation might
not account for the decreased PAK1 expression observed following ivermectin treatment. We next examined whether PAK1 was

degraded through the proteasome/ubiquitination pathway. We
showed that treatment of MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, could
stabilize the protein levels of PAK1 in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231
cells (Fig. 7B), suggesting that PAK1 may be degraded by the
proteasome/ubiquitination pathway.
To further determine whether ivermectin-induced PAK1 reduction is due to proteasome-mediated degradation, we measured
the effect of ivermectin on PAK1 ubiquitination by cotransfecting
PAK1-HA and Flag-ubiquitin expression vectors in human
HEK293T cells with or without MG132 treatment. As shown
in Fig. 7C, ivermectin markedly induced PAK1–Ub conjugation
and this was further enhanced by MG132 treatment. Bioinformatics analysis was then used to identify the potential ubiquitination site(s) of PAK1. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, 47
lysine residues in PAK1 were identiﬁed using the UbPred program
(www.ubpred.org), and six candidates (Lys11, Lys29, Lys39,
Lys148, Lys162, Lys256) were predicted with high conﬁdence to
be the ubiquitination sites (32). To test the contribution of these
lysine residues to PAK1 ubiquitination, we constructed six singlesite mutants with each of the six lysine residues mutated to
arginine (K11R, K29R, K39R, K148R, K162R, and K256R). However, the ubiquitination of these mutants was almost the same as
the wild type (Fig. 7D). We further constructed another six
mutants (K11, K29, K39, K148, K162, and K256) that each
contained a single candidate lysine (e.g., K11 contained one lysine
at position 11 with other ﬁve lysines mutated to arginine). As
shown in Fig. 7E, ubiquitin was conjugated efﬁciently with PAK1
mutants containing K11, K29, K39, or K148, indicating that these
four lysines might be potential ubiquitination sites. These results
show that ivermectin downregulates the expression of PAK1 by
targeting the lysine residues at K11, K29, K39, or K148 and
promoting the ubiquitin/proteasome–mediated degradation in
breast cancer cells.

Discussion
The use of ivermectin, a broad-spectrum antiparasitic drug, has
now been extended to multiple disease models (14, 33). Recently,
this antiparasitic drug has been proposed as a promising anticancer agent in several types of cancer due to its remarkable
ability to inhibit tumor growth (16, 17). However, the mechanisms underlying the growth-inhibitory effects of ivermectin are
still elusive. In this study, our data revealed that ivermectin
suppressed Akt/mTOR signaling by promoting ubiquitination
degradation of PAK1, and thereby activated cytostatic autophagy,
leading to inhibition of tumor growth in breast cancer cells.
Studies on cancer treatment have identiﬁed autophagy activation as a consequence of chemotherapy or radiotherapy; however,
the role that autophagy plays in cancer progression is varied (34).
Generally, autophagy is considered as a prosurvival mechanism in
cancer cells by removing damaged organelles and recycling nutrients upon anticancer treatment (10). However, a recent remarkable ﬁnding is that autophagy induced by certain chemotherapeutic agents may have a suppressive role in cancer cells, revealing
two additional functional forms of autophagy, of which one is the
cytotoxic function that results in autophagic cell death or promotes apoptosis, the other is the cytostatic function that may
inhibit cell proliferation in an apoptosis-independent way (6, 7).
In this study, we demonstrated that ivermectin-induced autophagy inhibited the growth of breast cancer cells while no significant apoptosis was observed till 48 hours after ivermectin treat-

ment, suggesting that short-term treatment of ivermectin induces
cytostatic autophagy in breast cancer cells. Similar reports have
been documented that drug-induced autophagy may precede
apoptosis in certain cancer cells (35, 36), it would be of particular
interest for us to consider optimal manipulation of autophagy for
cancer treatment in combination with conventional apoptosisinducing agents. Because of the complex nature of apoptosis and
autophagy in cell fate determination (36), further studies are
needed to investigate the crosstalk between these tightly regulated
biological processes.
Conventional anticancer therapies primarily trigger apoptosis
to promote cancer cell death. However, accumulating evidence
suggests that cancer cells may deregulate apoptosis, leading to
drug resistance and tumor recurrence (37, 38). Thus, with current
chemotherapy regimens, apoptosis resistance has become a tremendous challenge in the development of novel anticancer
therapies. As a backup strategy to inhibit tumor growth, cytostatic
autophagy may overcome these barriers by inhibiting the growth
of cancer cells regardless of their sensitivity to apoptosis (39, 40).
In support of this, very recently, it has been reported that the
combination of radiotherapy with vitamin D inhibits cell proliferation through inducing cytostatic autophagy in non-small cell
lung cancer cells (41). Our results revealed that autophagy
induced by ivermectin has the capacity to inhibit breast cancer
cell growth in a cytostatic way, suggesting that the use of ivermectin as an anticancer agent may reduce the self-renewal capacity
and proliferation recovery in breast cancer cells.
The Akt/mTOR signaling pathway is a major pathway accounting for autophagy activation and is also involved in regulating the
proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells (42). In this study, we
found that the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway was signiﬁcantly
inhibited by ivermectin. The inhibited Akt/mTOR signaling in
ivermectin-treated cells was attributed to down regulated PAK1
(15), whose expression correlates with the phosphorylation of Akt
(29). Our data showed that ivermectin could markedly decrease
the expression of PAK1 and inhibit the Akt/mTOR signaling
pathway, implicating the PAK1/Akt/mTOR axis as a novel pathway in ivermectin-induced autophagy. Although previous studies
have mentioned that ivermectin could decrease the expression of
PAK1, the detailed mechanism underlying ivermectin-regulated
PAK1 still remains unclear. We showed that ivermectin downregulated PAK1 protein levels by targeting the lysine residues at
K11, K29, K39, or K148 and promoting ubiquitination-mediated
degradation. These results support ivermectin as a potent agent in
the induction of ubiquitination-mediated degradation of PAK1,
suggesting that ivermectin-mediated inhibition of the PAK1/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway may merit exploration as a therapeutic
strategy for breast cancer treatment.
Notably, PAK1 has been demonstrated to be increased in breast
cancer and plays a key role in promoting tumor growth and drug
resistance (30, 43–45). The oncogenic function of PAK1 is also
observed in other cancers, such as colon cancer, neuroﬁbromatosis, and ovarian cancer (31, 46, 47). Thus, further study targeting
PAK1 may provide an optional therapeutic strategy for tumors
with PAK1 overexpression. On the basis of our ﬁndings, the
combination of traditional anticancer treatment with ivermectin
seems to be a rational way to treat cancer cells with PAK1-involved
drug resistance (48, 49). In line with our hypothesis, a recent study
showed that ivermectin could alleviate multidrug resistance in
breast cancer and enhance the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and
paclitaxel (50). Further studies may focus on validating the effect

of ivermectin in conjunction with conventional anticancer therapies in drug-resistant tumors.
In summary, our study revealed that ivermectin inhibited the
tumor growth of breast cancer by inducing PAK1/Akt/mTOR axismediated cytostatic autophagy. These ﬁndings provide insights
into the anticancer efﬁcacy of ivermectin, which support a preclinical rational to explore broadening the clinical evaluation of
ivermectin for the treatment of breast tumor.
