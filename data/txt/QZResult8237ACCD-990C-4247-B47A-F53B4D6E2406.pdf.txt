BACKGROUND. The authors compared the relative efficacy and safety of lowmolecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the
initial treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) between patients with and
without cancer.

METHODS. By using Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews, separate
meta-analyses were conducted for subgroups of patients with and without cancer, and relative risks (RRs) were compared for statistical significance. The methMD, PhD

RESULTS. LMWH reduced mortality significantly compared with UFH in patients
with cancer (RR of 0.71; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.52-0.98 [moderatequality evidence]) but not in patients without cancer (RR of 0.97; 95% CI, 0.651.46 [low-quality evidence]). However, the difference in the RR for the 2 subgroups did not reach statistical significance (P 5 .113). The difference between

thromboembolism (VTE) are more likely to develop
recurrent VTE with an annual risk from 21% to 27%,
which represents a 2- to 3-fold risk increase.1,2 These
patients also are more likely to develop major bleeding with an annual risk from 12% to 13%, which
represents a 2- to 6-fold risk increase.1,2
In the initial treatment of VTE, low-molecular
weight heparins (LMWH) and unfractionated heparin
(UFH) may have a different comparative efficacy in
patients with cancer than in patients without cancer.
To our knowledge, no systematic review has focused
on the initial treatment of VTE in patients with cancer or compared the results patient subgroups with
and without cancer. An analysis that includes an evaluation of direct comparative trials and subgroup
analysis could prevent the potential pitfalls of such
investigations.3
Thus, the objective of this systematic review was
to evaluate the relative efficacy and safety of LMWH
and UFH for the initial treatment of VTE in patients
with cancer. A secondary objective was to compare
the relative efficacy and safety between patients with
and without cancer.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data Sources and Searches
In January 2007, we conducted an electronic search
of the following databases: MEDLINE (1966 onward;
accessed through OVID), EMBASE (1980 onward;
accessed through OVID), ISI the Web of Science, and
the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL) (the first quarter of 2007). The search
strategies combined the terms for anticoagulants of
interest and the terms for cancer with search filters
for randomized controlled trials (RCTs)4 and are
available from the authors on request. We also hand
searched the conference proceedings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) (starting
with its first volume in 1982) and of the American
Society of Hematology (ASH) (starting with its 2003
issue). We reviewed the reference lists of included
articles, relevant articles, and related systematic
reviews5-10 and used the related article feature in
PubMed to identify additional articles.
Study Selection
Two reviewers independently screened the titles and
abstracts for eligibility and then screened the full text
of articles using a standardized form and resolved
their disagreements by discussion or by consulting a
third reviewer. We included studies that were RCTs
and that enrolled patients who had cancer and a
confirmed diagnosis of VTE that was determined

using an objective diagnostic test. The RCTs should
have compared LMWH with UFH for the initial treatment phase (typically the first 5-10 days). The outcomes of interest included death from any cause,
symptomatic VTE (diagnosed using an objective
diagnostic test), major bleeding, minor bleeding,
thrombocytopenia, and postphlebitic syndrome.

Data Extraction and Quality Assessment
Two reviewers used a standardized form to independently extract data relating to participants’ characteristics, the interventions, outcomes assessment,
and methodologic quality. They resolved their disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third
reviewer. We wrote to authors of included trials for
incompletely reported data. We included abstracts
only if investigators supplied necessary data on
methods and results.
Participants’ characteristics included demographic characteristics (age and sex); cancer characteristics (type, location, stage, time since diagnosis,
estimated life expectancy, current cancer treatments,
and performance status); and whether participants
had deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism,
either, or both. We extracted the following information relating to the intervention: type and dosage
schedule of LMWH, dosage schedule of UFH, duration
of the initial therapy, and type (oral anticoagulant vs
LMWH) and duration of long-term anticoagulation. We
extracted the outcome data necessary to conduct
intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses.
Methodologic criteria included allocation concealment, patient blinding, clinician blinding, outcome assessor blinding, analyst blinding, percentage
of follow-up, adherence to the ITT principle, and
avoidance of early stoppage of the trial. We graded
the quality of underlying evidence for each outcome
using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.
Data Synthesis and Analysis
We calculated the agreement between the 2 reviewers
for the assessment of eligibility using the kappa statistic. We checked for possible publication bias using
inverted funnel plots of individual trial results plotted
against the inverse of the variance.
For a specific outcome and for each trial, we
extracted the number of participants and the number
of events by treatment arm and calculated a pooled
relative risk (RR). We pooled the results by using a
random-effects model. For studies that reported
separate data for patients with cancer and patients
without cancer, we conducted separate meta-analyses

for these 2 subgroups and compared their RRs for
statistical significance using the Z test.11
We measured homogeneity across trial results by
using the I2 statistic, which measures variability
between studies that cannot be explained by chance,
and considered the following classification of heterogeneity based on the value of I2: 0 to 30, low; 30 to
60, moderate and worthy of investigation; 60 to 90,
severe and worthy of understanding; and 90 to 100,
allowing aggregation only with major caution
(unpublished data). To explain heterogeneity, we
planned subgroup analyses based on the characteristics of the participants, the interventions, and the
outcomes. However, we could not conduct a subgroup analysis based on characteristics of participants, because these were not available for patients
with cancer. We conducted sensitivity analysis by
excluding studies with small and unbalanced arms.

screening identified 57 citations as potentially eligible. The full text screening excluded 33 citations. The
remaining 24 citations were reports of studies in
which patients with cancer represented study subgroups. Two articles did report the cancer subgroups
data.12,13 Three other articles14-16 had follow-up publications reporting the cancer subgroup data.17-20 We
contacted the authors of the remaining 19 articles to
request cancer subgroup data: One author provided
us with the data21; another author indicated that the
data were not available anymore22; we used the cancer subgroup data for 7 articles,23-29 because they
were reported in 2 published systematic reviews5,8;
and we were not able to obtain any outcome data for
the remaining studies.30-39 Thus, of 24 studies with
cancer patients’ subgroups, we were able to obtain
data for 13 studies. Agreement between authors for
study eligibility was excellent (kappa of 0.94).

of 1016 patients with cancer and 4797 patients without cancer. None of the studies specified the type(s)
of cancer of participants. In 12 of the 13 studies, the
initial parenteral anticoagulation was followed by
oral anticoagulation for at least 3 months. In collaborative European multicenter study, the long-term
anticoagulation was either subcutaneous UFH or oral
anticoagulation, depending on the participating center’s usual regimen.23

Methodologic Quality of Included Studies
Allocation was concealed adequately in 11 studies,
and it was unclear whether allocation was concealed
adequately in 2 studies.14,23 All but 1 study16 blinded
outcome assessors. Only 2 studies blinded data analysts,16,21 and only 2 studies blinded patients and
caregivers.15,23 Eight studies clearly used ITT analysis.12,15,16,21,23,24,26,28 Although follow-up was 89% for
1 study14 and 92% for another,23 it was 100% for the
remaining studies. None of the studies had to be
stopped early for benefit. In 3 studies, the subgroups
of patients with cancer had small and imbalanced
arms with respect to the number of patient randomized to each treatment (ie, the number of patients
in the LMWH and UFH arms for the 3 studies were
6 and 12, 7 and 2, 7 and 2, respectively).13,23,27 The
methodologic quality for death and recurrent VTE
outcomes, respectively, was moderate and low for
patients with cancer and low for both outcomes
among patients without cancer (summary of findings
tables are available from the authors on request).
Quantitative Data Synthesis
Mortality
The number of fatal events was available for 11 studies (801 patients with cancer, 3364 patients without
cancer) at 3 months of follow-up.12,13,15,21,23-29 In

patients with cancer, LMWH significantly reduced
mortality compared with UFH (RR of 0.71; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.52-0.98) (Fig. 2). No heterogeneity was detected (I2 5 0%), and the quality of
evidence was moderate. After excluding the 3 studies
with small and imbalanced arms,13,23,27 the benefit
maintained borderline statistical significance (RR of
0.72; 95% CI, 0.52-1.00). The inverted funnel plot for
the outcome of death did not suggest a publication
bias (Fig. 3).
For patients without cancer, the difference in
mortality between LMWH and UFH was not statistically significant (RR of 0.97; 95% CI, 0.65-1.46)
(Fig. 4). No heterogeneity was detected (I2 5 0%),
and the quality of evidence was low. None of these
studies had small or imbalanced arms. The inverted
funnel plot for the outcome of death suggested that
small studies favoring UFH over LMWH may be
missing (Fig. 5). However, the difference between the

RRs of the subgroups of patients with cancer and of
patients without cancer was not statistically significant (P 5 .113).

Recurrent VTE
No data were available for deep venous thrombosis
or pulmonary embolism events separately. Data for
recurrent VTE events were available for 3 studies
(371 patients with cancer, 1997 patients without cancer).14,16,21 For patients with cancer, the pooled analysis showed no statistically significant difference
between LMWH and UFH (RR of 0.78; 95% CI, 0.292.08). Heterogeneity was moderate (I2 5 32.4%),
whereas the quality of evidence was low. For patients
without cancer, the pooled analysis demonstrated no
statistically significant difference between LMWH
and UFH (RR of 0.94; 95% CI, 0.60-1.46). No heterogeneity was detected (I2 5 0%), and the quality of
evidence was low. The difference between the RR for
patients with and without cancer was not statistically
significant (P 5 .367). No data were available for
bleeding outcomes, thrombocytopenia, or postphlebitic syndrome.

DISCUSSION
This systematic review revealed a clinically and statistically significant mortality reduction with LMWH
compared with UFH as initial treatment for VTE in
the subgroup of patients with cancer (moderatequality evidence) but not in the subgroup of patients
without cancer (low-quality evidence). However, the
difference in mortality reduction between the 2 subgroups was not statistically significant. The difference
between LMWH and UFH in the effect on recurrent
VTE was not statistically significant either in or
between the 2 subgroups.

FIGURE 5. Funnel plot for death in patients without cancer. SE indicates
standard error; RR, relative risk.

The superiority of LMWH over UFH in the initial
treatment of VTE in the subgroup of patients with
cancer is supported by a clinically and statistically
significant effect estimate of mortality reduction.
However, such a conclusion is weakened by 2 findings: 1) the moderate-quality evidence supporting
the statistically significant effect estimate and 2) the
absence of a statistically significant difference with
the effect estimate in the subgroup of patients without cancer, which indicates no difference between
LWMH and UFH. The absence of a difference
between the effect estimates of the 2 subgroups
obviously can be because of the lack of statistical
power. Thus, it can be concluded that LMWH most
likely is superior to UFH in reducing mortality.
Our systematic approach to searching, study selection, and data extraction should have minimized the
likelihood of missing relevant studies. Another strength
of this review is the systematic and transparent grading

1692

CANCER

of the quality of underlying evidence by outcome
using the GRADE methodology. A major limitation of
this review, similar to related reviews,40,41 is the
underreporting of the cancer subgroup data. For the
death outcome, we were not able to obtain data for
10 studies, which would have contributed 340 additional patients with cancer to the meta-analysis (801
patients currently are included). If the treatment
effect from those studies was different from the true
effect, then not including them in the meta-analysis
would have biased our results. Cancer subgroup data
for VTE recurrence outcomes were available from
only 3 trials. No cancer subgroup data were available
for bleeding outcomes. Another potential limitation
of our review is the limitation of the electronic search
strategy to patients with cancer, whereas the data
needed for this review came from studies that were
not restricted to this subgroup. However, we believe
that the supplemental search strategies we used (in
addition to the electronic search) were effective.
In fact, our search strategy did not miss any of the
studies reported in earlier systematic reviews on the
topic.5,7,8
The systematic review found that LMWH is most
likely superior to UFH in reducing mortality but not
recurrent VTE. A potential explanation of this finding
is the lack of power to demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the effects of these therapies on recurrent VTE. In fact, fewer studies and
fewer patients were included in the meta-analysis of
VTE compared with the meta-analysis of death.
Another potential explanation is that the antitumoral
effect of anticoagulation, for which the evidence is
accumulating,42,43 might vary by the type of anticoagulant.
Three previous systematic reviews compared the
effects of LMWH and UFH on mortality in patients
with cancer and VTE. A 1999 review by Hettiarachchi
et al included 9 studies and 629 patients and resulted
in an odds ratio (OR) of 0.61 (95%CI, 0.40-0.93).8 A
review by Gould et al included 279 patients and
resulted in an OR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.31-1.03).7 van
Dongen et al, in a Cochrane review, conducted a
subgroup analysis of patients with cancer and that 6
studies and 446 patients and resulted in an OR of
0.53 (95% CI, 0.33-0.85).5 Although the current review
included more studies and patients (11 studies and
801 cancer patients) than the 3 previous reviews, our
results are consistent with theirs.
The current review also indicated that there is a
differential relative efficacy of LMWH and UFH on
mortality, depending on the cancer status. The 2
reviews by Hettiarachchi et al and van Dongen et al
compared the relative efficacy of LMWH and UFH

separately in patients with and without cancer.5,8
Although LMWH was superior to UFH in patients
with cancer, as noted above, the 2 therapies were statistically equivalent in patients without cancer with
respective ORs of 0.94 (95% CI, 0.60-1.47)8 and 0.97
(95% CI, 0.61-1.56).5 However, those authors did not
test the statistical significance of the difference
between the ORs of the 2 subgroups. A systematic
review of the long-term anticoagulation for VTE
treatment in patients with cancer demonstrated that
LMWH significantly reduced recurrent venous
thromboembolism in patients with cancer40; previous
reviews that were not restricted to patients with cancer demonstrated no such difference.44,45 The reason
for this differential effect in patients with cancer is
not clear.
Our analysis fulfills 6 of the 7 criteria for a credible subgroup analysis.3 First, we conducted withinstudy comparisons (ie, direct comparisons) rather
than between studies (indirect comparisons). Second,
testing of the differences between the 2 subgroups
was based on a priori hypothesis and was not a post
hoc analysis. Third, this hypothesis was the only one
tested and, thus, is unlikely to have occurred simply
by chance. Fourth, the magnitude of difference
between the RRs of the 2 subgroups (0.71 for
patients with cancer and 0.97 for patients without
cancer) was relatively large and clinically significant.
Fifth, the effects were consistent across studies,
because no heterogeneity was detected in either subgroup. Sixth, the difference was compelling biologically and was consistent the accumulating evidence
of an antitumor effect of anticoagulation that could
vary in magnitude by type of anticoagulant.40,42,43
The analysis did not fulfill the seventh criterion, ie,
the difference between the RRs of the 2 subgroups
did not reach statistical significance.
In summary, LMWH most likely is superior to
UFH in reducing mortality as the initial treatment of
VTE for patients with cancer. However, there are
additional advantages of LMWH related to outpatient
treatment and subcutaneous administration. At the
same time, both therapies come with the risk of
major bleeding events. The decision for a patient
with cancer to start one or the other option should
balance the benefits and downsides and should integrate the patient’s values and preferences. There is a
need to conduct better designed trials that are restricted to patients with cancer. Also, addressing all
important outcomes, including harm, is of great importance in making evidence-based healthcare decisions. Finally, researchers should consider making
the raw data from RCTs available for individual
patient data meta-analysis.
