ABSTRACT
The anti-leukemic activity of the mitochondria-targeting small molecule sodium
dichloroacetate (DCA), used alone and in association with the small molecule inhibitor
of the p53/MDM2 interaction Nutlin-3, was analyzed in primary B-chronic lymphocytic
leukemia (B-CLL) samples (n=22), normal peripheral blood cells (n=10) and in p53wildtype
EHEB, JVM-2, JVM-3 B lymphoblastoid cell lines. DCA exhibited a dose-dependent
anti-leukemic activity in both primary B-CLL and B leukemic cell lines with a functional
p53 status and showed a synergistic cytotoxic activity when used in combination with
Nutlin-3. At the molecular level, DCA positively regulated p53 activity, as documented
by post-transcriptional modifications of p53 protein, and synergized with Nutlin-3
in increasing the expression of the p53-target genes MDM2, PUMA, TIGAR and in
particular p21. The potential role of p21 in mediating the DCA+Nutlin-3 anti-leukemic
activity was underscored in knocking-down experiments. Indeed, transfection of
leukemic cells with p21 siRNAs significantly decreased the DCA+Nutlin-3-induced
cytotoxicity. Taken together, our data emphasize that DCA is a molecule that merits
to be further evaluated as a chemotherapeutic agent for B-CLL, likely in combination
with other therapeutic compounds.

INTRODUCTION

most tissues after oral administration [4]. DCA shows
several interesting characteristics, such as effectiveness
in a variety of solid tumor cell lines and relatively low
toxicity on normal cells. Moreover, DCA is a generic drug
with low price, which has been in use in humans for more
than 30 years. Most of the current studies on DCA have
been performed on solid tumors, such as non-small cell
lung cancer, breast cancer and most glioblastoma cell
lines [4,5]. Additional studies have been performed on
endometrial, prostate, breast and colorectal [6-14] cancer
cells and more recently on multiple myeloma cells [15].
On the other hand, since leukemic cell lines use glycolysis
but also non-glucose bioenergetic pathways such as fatty

Most cancers possess a near-universal metabolic
phenotype known as the ‘Warburg effect’, which is
characterized by enhanced glycolytic flux for ATP
production, glucose to lactate conversion and reduced
mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, even under
aerobic conditions [1-3]. There is now growing evidence
that the mitochondria might be primary targets in cancer
therapeutics instead of simple bystanders during cancer
development. Interestingly, this cancer-specific metabolic
remodeling can be reversed by dichloroacetate (DCA), a
mitochondria-targeting small molecule able to penetrate

RESULTS

acid oxidation and/or amino-acid metabolism [16], the
potential efficacy of DCA on leukemic cells should be
investigated, also considering that no data are currently
available on this issue.
On these bases, the aim of the present study was to
evaluate the potential therapeutic perspectives of DCA as
anti-leukemic drug. For this purpose, DCA was added to
primary B chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cells
and to primary normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMC), either alone or in association with Nutlin-3, a
small molecule inhibitor of the MDM2/p53 interaction.
In addition, the molecular mechanisms of action of
DCA+Nutlin-3 were evaluated in a panel of p53wild-type B
leukemic cell lines (EHEB, JVM-2, JVM-3).

DCA promotes cytotoxicity in primary B-CLL
patient derived cells, but not in normal peripheral
blood cells
In the first group of experiments, the effect of DCA
was comparatively analyzed on primary PBMC derived
from B-CLL patients (n=22; Table 1) and from healthy
blood donors (n=10). Treatment with DCA, used in the
range of 1-30 mM for up to 48 hours, exhibited a doseand time-dependent cytotoxicity, resulting in significant
reduction of leukemic cell viability with respect to the
untreated cultures, at concentrations ≥3 mM in B-CLL
patient cell samples (Figure 1A). The IC50 mean values
(±SD) of cytotoxicity of DCA in B-CLL patient samples

were 24±15 mM and 12±12 mM at 24 and 48 hours of
treatment, respectively (Figure 1B). On the other hand,
PBMC obtained from healthy donors were significantly
less susceptible to DCA cytotoxicity as compared to
primary B-CLL cells, with IC50 mean values (±SD) of
cytotoxicity of 198±106 mM and 93±52 mM at 24 and
48 hours of treatment (Figure 1A-B), clearly showing that
normal PBMC were completely resistant to DCA effects at
concentrations ≤10 mM. Thus, in line with previous data
obtained in solid tumor cell models [4-14] and multiple
myeloma [15], we have demonstrated for the first time that
DCA promoted a significant cytotoxicity also in primary
B-CLL samples but not in normal PBMC.

reduction of cell viability in all the p53wild-type B leukemic
cell lines tested, with IC50 values ranging from 25 to 30.4
mM at 24 hours of treatment and from 15.2 to 18.6 mM
at 48 hours of treatment, comparable to those of primary
B-CLL cells (Figure 1B). Flow cytometric analysis of
these leukemic cell cultures demonstrated that treatment
with DCA induced early accumulation in G1 phase of
the cell cycle (Figure 2B) and promoted apoptosis in all
leukemic cell lines (Figure 2C). The cytotoxic effects of
DCA on the B cell lines were coupled to the ability of
DCA to reduce the glucose consumption (data not shown)
and the mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 2D).
Based on these evidences, documenting the antiproliferative/pro-apoptotic activity of DCA in B leukemic
cells, we next assessed the effect of DCA treatment on the
expression of p53 in the EHEB, JVM-2, JVM-3 cell lines
by two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting,
which allows separation of proteins based on their
molecular weight (MW) and isoelectric point (pI). As
shown in Figure 3A, two-dimensional electrophoresis
revealed the presence of the full-length p53 (~53 kDa, pI
6-7.3) beside a group of spots below the 53 kDa (~40 kDa,
pI 5.5-6.5) in the untreated cultures. Upon DCA treatment
for 24 hours, it was possible to observe a slight increase
in the full-length p53 protein in the EHEB cell line and,
of note, the appearance of a series of isoforms above
the 53 kDa in all the cell lines, suggestive of p53 posttranslational modifications. In this respect, in Western blot
assay we have documented that DCA dose-dependently

DCA activates the p53 pathway in p53wild-type B
leukemic cell lines
Since most B-CLL at diagnosis are p53wild-type
[17,18], a condition also characterizing the primary B-CLL
samples analyzed in this study, it is noteworthy that
previous studies on solid tumors have implicated the p53
pathway in mediating the anti-tumoral activity of DCA
[5,6,19]. Therefore, in order to investigate the potential
involvement of p53 in mediating the anti-leukemic activity
of DCA, we next performed a series of experiments on
three p53wild-type B leukemic cell lines (EHEB, JVM-2
and JVM-3), used as model systems. As shown in Figure
2A, treatment with DCA resulted in a dose-dependent

DCA plus Nutlin-3 combination exhibits a potent
synergistic anti-leukemic activity

induced p53 phosphorylation in Ser15 and Ser392 (data not
shown). To test the hypothesis of functional activation of
p53 upon exposure to DCA, in parallel experiments we
have analyzed the levels of a subset of p53 transcriptional
targets involved in promoting cell cycle arrest (p21),
modulation of apoptosis (MDM2, Bax, PUMA) or
metabolism (TIGAR) by RT-PCR. As shown in Figure
3B, DCA variably but significantly (>2 fold) increased
the mRNA levels of MDM2, p21, PUMA and TIGAR in
all leukemic cell lines investigated, while no significant
modulation of BAX mRNA was observed.

In the next group of experiments, we have examined
the potential interaction of DCA with Nutlin-3, a small
molecule which transcriptionally activates p53 by
abolishing its interaction with its principal inhibitor
MDM2 [20]. For this purpose, leukemic cells were treated
with DCA (3-30 mM) and Nutlin-3 (1-10 μM), used as
single agents and in combination. In particular, B-CLL
leukemic cells were treated with serial concentrations of
DCA and Nutlin-3 at a constant DCA:Nutlin-3 ratio for
data analysis by the method of Chou and Talalay [21].

Combined treatment with DCA+Nutlin-3 resulted in
significantly (p<0.01) greater cytotoxicity with respect to
the single agents, with a synergistic effect both in primary
B-CLL patient samples as well as in B leukemic cell lines
(Figure 4A-B), as documented by an average Combination
Index (CI) <1 (Table 2). The cytotoxicity induced by the
combined treatment with DCA+Nutlin-3 was mainly due
to the increase of the degree of apoptosis with respect to
the treatment with DCA or Nutlin-3 used alone (Figure
4C).

both in promoting leukemic cytotoxicity as well as in
inducing p53 transcriptional activity, it was particularly
noteworthy that one of the genes up-regulated in response
to DCA±Nutlin-3 was p21. In this respect, a recent
study has demonstrated that a strong induction of p21
by genotoxic agents was predictive of better prognosis
in B-CLL [22]. Conversely, a lack of induction of p21
was observed in B-CLL patient samples showing a worse
prognosis even in the presence of an integral activation
of p53 [22]. Therefore, in order to functionally elucidate
the role of p21 in mediating the anti-leukemic activity
of DCA+Nutlin-3, we utilized siRNAs to attenuate p21
expression. The knock-down of p21 expression was
demonstrated by quantitative RT-PCR, documenting
a significant reduction of p21 mRNA in EHEB cells,
transfected with a cocktail of p21 specific siRNAs, both
at baseline as well as after DCA+Nutlin-3 treatment
(Figure 6A). Of note, in EHEB samples in which p21
expression was knocked-down by transfection with p21
specific siRNAs, the DCA+Nutlin-3-mediated cytotoxicity
was significantly (p<0.05) reduced with respect to either
cells transfected with a scrambled control siRNA or cells
not transfected (Figure 6B). Overall, these experiments
support a potential role of p21 in modulating the antileukemic activity of DCA+Nutlin-3.

Role of p21 induction in DCA and DCA+Nutlin-3
induced cytotoxicity in leukemic cells
With respect to DCA treatment, Nutlin-3 induced
a much more potent accumulation of both p53 and its
molecular targets MDM2 and p21 in p53wild-type leukemic
cells, as documented by Western blot analysis performed
on total cell lysates (Figure 5A). The combination of
DCA+Nutlin-3 did not result in a further accumulation
of p53 protein with respect to Nutlin-3 alone while it
promoted a greater induction of MDM2 and p21 proteins
with respect to Nutlin-3 alone (Figure 5A). Interestingly,
the combination of Nutlin-3+DCA significantly (p<0.05)
enhanced the induction of MDM2 and p21 at the mRNA
level, in both B leukemic cell lines and primary B-CLL
patient samples, but not in normal PBMC (Figure 5B).
Of note, the synergistic transcriptional induction of p53target genes by DCA+Nutlin-3, documented in leukemic
cells but not in normal PBMC, correlated with the lower
cytotoxicity of DCA+Nutlin-3 in these cells (Figure 5C).

demonstrate that DCA+Nutlin-3 strongly synergized

time that DCA exerts cytotoxic activity in primary B-CLL
patient samples, but not in normal PBMC obtained from
healthy individuals, in the same range of concentrations

on multiple myeloma [4-15] and that are therapeutically
achievable in vivo. Although the cytotoxic activity of DCA
has been attributed to PDK inhibition in solid tumor cell
models [1], the concentrations of DCA required to induce
apoptosis and/or to inhibit cell proliferation in vitro in B
leukemic cells are several log greater than the inhibition
constant (Ki) of PDK. Similar data were previously
obtained in studies performed in solid tumors [4-15]. In
considering the importance of our current demonstration
that DCA shows an anti-leukemic activity, it should be
noticed that there are 40 years of human experience with
mechanistic studies of DCA in human tissues after oral
use, pharmacokinetic and toxicity data from randomized
studies [23]. This supports an easy translation to early
phase clinical trials. In fact, DCA is an orally bioavailable,
low-cost small molecule and currently being evaluated in
phase I/II clinical trials for glioblastoma, gliomas and other
solid tumors [24]. DCA has interesting characteristics
as anticancer drug since it is easily administered and
affordable.
By using as a model system a panel of p53wildtype
B leukemic cell lines, we demonstrated that DCA
induces both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Thus,
although it has been previously hypothesized that the
lack of mitochondrial hyperpolarization in certain types
of cancers, including hematological malignancies [25],
might render DCA ineffective in such cases, and although
the relation between mitochondrial depolarization and
cytotoxicity varies in different tumor cell models [26],
we found that DCA induced mitochondrial depolarization
in B leukemic cell lines. In any case, it should be
taken into account that a metabolic heterogeneity has
been documented in another model of hematological
malignancy, such as multiple myeloma [15] as well as in
leukemic cell lines [16].
At the molecular level, DCA induced posttranscriptional modifications of p53 with activation
of the p53 transcriptional activity, as documented by

the induction of canonical p53 target genes, such as
MDM2, p21 and PUMA but not of BAX. Another major
finding of our study was the ability of DCA to potently
synergize with Nutlin-3, a non-genotoxic activator of the
p53 pathway, in promoting cytotoxicity in B leukemic
cell lines as well as in primary B-CLL patient cells,
with significantly less toxicity on normal PBMC. The
contribution of the transcriptional activity of p53 in
promoting leukemic cytotoxicity is still under debate,
as transcriptional independent activities have also been
demonstrated in previous studies performed with Nutlin-3
[17,18]. However, our current data demonstrate the
existence of a correlation between the ability to promote
the transcription of p53 transcriptional targets, and in
particular p21, and the synergistic cytotoxic activity in
response to the DCA+Nutlin-3 treatment. Indeed, while
the DCA+Nutlin-3 combination was extremely efficient
in inducing the transcription of p21 in both primary
B-CLL patient samples and B leukemic cell lines, it
was significantly less efficient when added to primary
normal PBMC. Interestingly, our current demonstration
that DCA+Nutlin-3 potently synergized in inducing the
transcriptional activation of p21 is noteworthy since the
transcriptional induction of p21 has been involved in
mediating the therapeutic effect of chemotherapeutic
drugs in B-CLL [22]. In this respect, the key role of p21
in mediating the anti-leukemic activity of DCA+Nutlin-3
was confirmed in p21 knock-down experiments. In
considering the cytotoxic activity of DCA+Nutlin-3 in
p53wild-type B-CLL cells, it is noteworthy that rapamycin,
like DCA, decreases the Warburg effect by inhibiting the
mTOR pathway [27] and that also Nutlin-3 via p53 can
inhibit the mTOR pathway [28,29]. Thus, besides inducing
p21, it is possible that inhibition of the mTOR pathway
also contributes to the cytotoxicity of the DCA+Nutlin-3
combination.
Since p53 defects are detected in less than 10% of
B-CLL patients at diagnosis [17,18], our study suggests

Figure 6: Role of p21 pathway in mediating the anti-leukemic activity of DCA+Nutlin-3. EHEB cells were transfected
with either control scrambled (scr) siRNA or p21 siRNA before treatment. In A, after transfection, efficiency of p21 knock-down was
documented by analyzing levels of p21 mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR, in untreated cells and upon treatment with DCA+Nutlin-3. Results
are expressed as folds of modulation with respect to the control cultures. In B, cultures transfected with either control scrambled (scr)
siRNA or p21 siRNA were analyzed for cell viability upon exposure to DCA+Nutlin-3. Results are expressed as percentage with respect to
the control vehicle cultures (set to 100%). Data are reported as means±SD.

that the anti-leukemic therapeutic potential of DCA, either
used alone or in combination with Nutlin-3, is promising
and should be further investigated since the majority
of B-CLL are suitable to respond to the DCA+Nutlin-3
combination. With respect to the subset of p53mutated B-CLL
cells, which significantly increases in B-CLL refractory
to fludarabine treatment [17,18], it should be explored
the possibility that the DCA+Nutlin-3 combination might
benefit from the addition of a microtubule active drug, like
vinblastine or nocodazole [30-34]. This hypothesis will
require further investigations in future studies.

under normoxic conditions. At different time points
after treatment, cell viability was examined by Trypan
blue dye exclusion and MTT (3-(4,5-dimethilthiazol2yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) colorimetric
assay (Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis,
IN) for data confirmation, as previously described [37].
Levels of apoptosis were quantified by Annexin V-FITC/
propidium iodide (PI) staining (Immunotech, Marseille,
France) followed by analysis using a FACSCalibur flow
cytometer (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA). To avoid
non-specific fluorescence from dead cells, live cells
were gated tightly using forward and side scatter, as
described [38, 39]. The cell cycle profile was analyzed
by flow cytometry after 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)
incorporation. Briefly, leukemic cells were incubated
with 50 μM BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37°C for 1 hour.
The antibody anti-BrdU (BD Biosciences Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA) was bound to BrdU incorporated into
neosynthesized DNA and the complex was detected by
FITC conjugated secondary antibody (Immunotech). Cells
were then stained with PI (50 μg/mL) and analyzed by
flow cytometry as previously described [40]. In parallel,
glucose consumption was measured as the conversion
of glucose to 6-phosphogluconate and NADH with the
Glucose (HK) Assay Kit (Sigma-Aldrich), as indicated by
the manufacturer and previously described [41].

METHODS
Primary B-CLL patient samples and B leukemic
cell lines
For experiments with primary cells, peripheral blood
samples were collected in heparin-coated tubes from 22
B-CLL patients and 10 healthy blood donors following
informed consent, in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki and in agreement with institutional guidelines
(University-Hospital of Ferrara). The main clinical
parameters of the B-CLL patients were abstracted from
clinical records (Table 1). All patients had been without
prior therapy at least for three weeks before blood
collection.
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
isolated by gradient centrifugation with lymphocyte cell
separation medium (Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby,
ON). T lymphocytes, NK lymphocytes, granulocytes
and monocytes were negatively depleted from peripheral
blood B-CLL with immunomagnetic microbeads (MACS
microbeads, Miltenyi Biotech, Auburn, CA), with a purity
>95% of resulting CD19+ population, as assessed by flow
cytometry analysis and previously described [35]. Primary
cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium containing
10% FBS, L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (all
from Gibco, Grand Island, NY).
The p53wild-type B leukemic cell lines EHEB, JVM2, JVM-3 [36] were purchased from DSMZ (Deutsche
Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen
GmbH, Braunschweig, Germany) and were routinely
cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% FBS,
L-glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (all from Gibco).

Flow cytometric assessment of mitochondrial
activity
Mitochondrial activity was evaluated staining
cells with MitoTracker® GreenFM (Molecular Probes,
Inc., Eugene, Oregon), which passively diffuses across
the plasma membrane and accumulates in active
mitochondria. Briefly, at different time points, cells were
incubated with pre-warmed MitoTracker staining solution
(obtained diluting MitoTracker® GreenFM in serum-free
medium to a final concentration of 25 nM) for 30 minutes
at 37°C. Cells were then washed with PBS (Gibco) and
analyzed by flow cytometry as previously described [42].

Western blot analyses
For Western blot analysis, cells were lysed as
previously described [43-44]. Protein determination was
performed by using the BCA Protein Assay (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL). Samples were supplemented
with loading buffer (250 mM Tris pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10%
glycerin, 4% beta-mercaptoethanol, 1% bromophenol
blue) and boiled for 2 minutes. Equal amounts of protein
for each sample were migrated in SDS-polyacrylamide
gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose filters, as previously
described [43,44]. The following Abs were used: anti-p53
(DO-1), anti-MDM2 (SMP14), anti-p21 (C-19), antiPUMAα/β (H-136), anti-PARP-1 (H-250) and anti-

For in vitro treatments with DCA (Sigma-Aldrich,
St Louis, MO), used either alone or in combination with
Nutlin-3 (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI), cells

Bax (2D2) purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
(Santa Cruz, CA); anti-Phospho-p53 (Ser15) and antiPhospho-p53 (Ser392) from Cell Signaling Technology
(Danvers, MA); anti-tubulin from Sigma-Aldrich. After
incubation with anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG horseradish
peroxidase-conjugated secondary Abs (Sigma-Aldrich),
specific reactions were revealed with the ECL Lightning
detection kit (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA). Densitometry
values for Western blot were estimated by the ImageQuant
TL software (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) and
were expressed as arbitrary units (a.u.). Multiple film
exposures were used to verify the linearity of the samples
analyzed and to avoid saturation of the film.

Western blotting detection reagents (GE Healtcare).

RNA analyses
Total RNA was extracted from cells using the
QIAGEN RNeasy Plus mini kit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) according to the supplier’s instructions. Once
verified the quality of RNA preparation by agarose
gel, total RNA was transcribed into cDNA, using the
QuantiTect® Reverse Transcription kit (QIAGEN).
p21, MDM2, BAX, PUMA, TIGAR gene expression
was analyzed using the SYBR Green-based real-time
quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT qPCR)
detection method with SABiosciences RT2 Real- TimeTM
Gene expression assays, which include specific validated
primer sets and PCR master mix (SABiosciences,
QIAGEN). All samples were run in triplicate using the
real time thermal analyzer Rotor-GeneTM 6000 (Corbett,
Cambridge, UK), as previously described [45,46].
Expression values were normalized to the housekeeping
gene POLR2A amplified in the same sample.

Bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and
immunoblotting
For bi-dimensional gel electrophoresis, protein
extraction was performed by adding 150 μl of lysis buffer
(5M urea, 2M tiourea, 2% CHAPS, 2% Zwittergent
detergent; all from Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) with
protease inhibitors (Complete, mini EDTA-free mixture,
Roche Applied Science, Milan, Italy) to the cell pellets.
Lysates were sonicated for 3 min, and 250 units of
benzonase endonuclease (Novagen, San Diego, CA) were
added to each sample and incubated for 40 minutes at room
temperature on rotary shaker. Cell debris were removed
by centrifugation at 13000 x g for 10 minutes, 15°C. The
supernatants were aliquoted and stored at −80°C. Protein
concentration was measured with a modified Bradford
method (BioRad, Milan, Italy). Protein extracts (30 μg)
from each sample were diluted to a final volume of 125
μl in the rehydration solution (5M urea, 2M thiourea, 2%
CHAPS, 2% Zwittergent, 100 mM DeStreak, 0.5% IPG
buffer pH 3–10 linear; all from GE Healthcare) and then
applied on immobilized pH 3–10 linear gradient strips, 7
cm (IPG strips, GE Healthcare). Briefly, IPG strips were
hydrated on an IPGphor apparatus (GE Healthcare) for 16
h at 30 V/h and then focused for 26 h until 50,000 V-h.
After the first-dimension run, proteins were reduced by
LDS Sample Buffer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA)
containing 60 mM DTT (GE Healthcare). Proteins were
alkylated by 100 mM iodoacetamide (Sigma-Aldrich).
The strips were then embedded in 0.7% (w/v) agarose
on the top of 1-mm-thick acrylamide precast gels at 10%
(Life Technologies). After electrophoresis the proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane by standard
electroblotting and stained with MemCode™ Reversible
protein stain kit (Fisher Scientific, Illkirch Cedex, France).
After blocking with 5% dry milk in TBS-Tween20 for 1 h
at room temperature, the membranes were probed with an
anti-p53 (DO-1) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and
then exposed to the peroxidase-linked specie specific antimouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). The p53 positive proteins
were visualized using chemiluminescence plus (ECL plus)
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Transfection experiments
Leukemic cells (2x106 cells/0.1 ml) were mixed with
either 1 µg of control enhanced green fluorescence protein
(EGFP) plasmid or 2 µg of small interfering RNA (siRNA)
cocktails, transferred to a 2.0-mm electroporation cuvette
and nucleofected with the nucleofector kit V (Lonza
Cologne AG, Cologne, Germany) using the nucleofector
device (Amaxa Nucleofector II apparatus, Lonza). After
electroporation, cells were immediately transferred to
a complete medium and cultured at 37°C until analysis.
Transfection efficiency was monitored in each experiment
by scoring the percentage of EGFP-positive cells by flow
cytometry analysis. For specific p21 gene knock-down,
siRNAs were designed and manufactured by Ambion®
(Life Technologies) according to the current guidelines
for effective gene knock-down by this method. Negative
control siRNA consisted of a 19 bp-scrambled sequence
with 3’ dT overhangs (Ambion’s Silencer negative control
siRNA). The Ambion’s Silencer negative control siRNA
sequence has no significant homology to any known gene
sequences from human and it has been previously tested
for the lack of non-specific effects on gene expression.

Statistical analysis and assessment of the effect of
combination treatment
The results were evaluated by using analysis of
variance with subsequent comparisons by Student’s t-test
and with the Mann-Whitney rank-sum test. Statistical
significance was defined as p<0.05. In order to investigate
the effect of DCA+Nutlin-3 combination, leukemic cells

were then treated with serial doses of DCA (range 3-30
mM) or Nutlin-3 (range 1-10 microM), individually or
in combination using a constant ratio (DCA:Nutlin-3).
Results were analyzed with the method of Chou and
Talalay to determine whether combined treatment yields
greater effects than expected from summation alone: a
combination index (CI) of 1 indicates an additive effect,
while a CI below 1 indicates synergism. For this purpose
cell viability data were analyzed with the CalcuSyn
software (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK) and reported either as
CI values or as dose-effect curves directly drawn by the
CalcuSyn software.
