ABSTRACT
A new generation of anticancer therapeutics called target drugs has quickly
developed in the 21st century. These drugs are tailored to inhibit cancer cell growth,
proliferation, and viability by specific interactions with one or a few target proteins.
However, despite formally known molecular targets for every “target” drug, patient
response to treatment remains largely individual and unpredictable. Choosing the
most effective personalized treatment remains a major challenge in oncology and is
still largely trial and error. Here we present a novel approach for predicting target drug
efficacy based on the gene expression signature of the individual tumor sample(s).
The enclosed bioinformatic algorithm detects activation of intracellular regulatory
pathways in the tumor in comparison to the corresponding normal tissues. According
to the nature of the molecular targets of a drug, it predicts whether the drug can
prevent cancer growth and survival in each individual case by blocking the abnormally
activated tumor-promoting pathways or by reinforcing internal tumor suppressor
cascades. To validate the method, we compared the distribution of predicted drug
efficacy scores for five drugs (Sorafenib, Bevacizumab, Cetuximab, Sorafenib,
Imatinib, Sunitinib) and seven cancer types (Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Colon
cancer, Lung adenocarcinoma, non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Thyroid cancer and Sarcoma)
with the available clinical trials data for the respective cancer types and drugs.
The percent of responders to a drug treatment correlated significantly (Pearson’s
correlation 0.77 p = 0.023) with the percent of tumors showing high drug scores
calculated with the current algorithm.

~100% mortality to ~90-95% disease-specific survival
observed nowadays [1, 2]. However, many individual
cases and types of cancer remain incurable or even
unresponsive using standard chemotherapy approaches.
Moreover, chemotherapy generally causes severe side
effects, which significantly decrease the quality of life
of a patient [3, 4]. The chemical compounds included
in standard chemotherapy cocktails have numerous
molecular targets in cancerous and normal cells, which
makes it difficult to simulate and predict the activity of
drug to an individual patient based on the molecular data,
and in standard practice clinicians routinely use clinical
or morphological predictive factors like stage, grade,
proliferative activity, etc [5, 6]. These predictive factors
are typically very inaccurate and not applicable for tracing
the individual patient response to chemotherapy drugs and
regimens.
To address specific activities of certain functionally
relevant proteins and their aggregates frequently observed
in cancer, a new generation of anticancer drugs was
generated that target one or a few specific molecules in
a cell [7]. This class of drugs consists mostly of specific
monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) and low molecular weight
kinase-inhibitor molecules (Nibs; [8]). At least fifty
different anticancer target drugs have been approved by
national food and drug administration (FDA) systems and
present on the global pharmacological market today (e.g.,
accessible through Metadrug database, www.drugbank.
ca).
The emergence of target drugs was beneficial
for the treatment of several cancer types. For example,
trastuzumab (anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody) and several
other new anti-HER2 medications at least doubled median
survival time in patients with metastatic HER2-positive
breast cancer and improved 5-year survival in early stage
disease to ~90-95% [9, 10]. Interestingly, before the
introduction of trastuzumab, HER2-positive cancers had
the worst prognoses across all breast cancer subtypes,
whereas now the situation is reverted [11]. Patients with
melanoma (deadly skin cancer type) for decades had no
treatment opportunities except dacarbazine chemotherapy,
which resulted in <10% chance of very short-lasting
(~5-6 month) response and median survival less than a
year. Now, in the case of BRAF-mutated tumor, they can
receive vemurafenib (anti-BRAF target drug) and have
~50% chance of response [12], or, irrespectively of BRAF
mutation, ipilimumab (immune checkpoint inhibitor) with
~20% chance of long-term (>5 years) disease control [13].
Importantly, the results of clinical trials clearly
suggest that for many drugs considered inefficient
for treatment of a given cancer type, a tiny fraction
of the patients exists to whom these drugs can be of a
significant benefit. For example, no benefit was seen in
large randomized studies in cohort of unselected patients
with non-small cell lung cancer after introduction of antiEGFR drugs (gefitinib and erlotinib). But it was observed
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

that ~10-15% of the patients who participated in these
studies survived unpredictably long. Further investigation
revealed that all these patients had activating mutation
of EGFR and that this mutation may predict response to
the EGFR-targeting drugs. Indeed, contemporary studies
showed tha t patients with EGFR-mutated tumors have
the strongest advantage with these types of target therapy
[14]. In the case of colorectal cancer, discovery of the
role of KRAS mutation in the resistance to the EGFRtargeting antibody (cetuximab or panitumumab) helped to
identify a group of patients that can benefit from this kind
of treatment (patients with wild-type KRAS). Moreover,
further studies demonstrated that for KRAS-mutated
tumors (~40% of colorectal cancer), anti-EGFR antibodies
cause harm and decrease survival [15].
It is of great importance, therefore, to identify
accurate predictive markers of target drug efficacy.
Several clinical tests have been used to identify optimal
personalized cancer treatments [16, 17]. These tests
mostly utilize data on the expression of certain individual
genes and on somatic mutations within these genes, as
mentioned above. Alternatively, drugs can target abnormal
fusion proteins frequently formed in cancer cells, such as
chimeric fusion BCR-ABL and the respective drug imatinib
[18, 19]. However, most of these predictor features profile
only several biomarkers, cover only a minor fraction of
target drugs, and are limited to a particular type of cancer.
Somewhat more universal methods are required to rank
the maximum number of existing drugs.
We propose that a shift in focus to the activation of
intracellular signaling pathways in cancer may advance
the development of such approach. We report here a
method for predicting target drug efficacy based on a
patient’s cancer-specific patterns of signaling pathway
activation (SPA), particularly for pathways including
molecular targets of respective drugs. The enclosed
algorithm operates with the so-called Pathway Activation
Strength (PAS) value, which is a qualitative characteristic
of pathway activity in a cancer sample. Several approaches
were published previously by us and others to measure
PAS based on large scale gene expression data; these
may be used with either transcriptomes or proteomes.
Khatri et al [20] classified those methods into three major
groups: Over-Representation Analysis (ORA), Functional
Class Scoring (FCS) and Pathway Topology (PT)-based
approaches. ORA-based methods calculate if the pathway
is significantly enriched with differentially expressed
genes [21-23]. These methods have many limitations, as
they ignore all non-differentially expressed genes and do
not take into account many gene-specific characteristics.
FCS-based approaches partially tackle aforementioned
limitations by calculating fold change-based scores for
each gene and then combining them into a single pathway
enrichment score [24-26]. PT-based analysis also takes
into account topological characteristics of each given
pathway, assigning additional weights to the genes (for a

review, see [27]). Recently, to account for gene expression
variability within a pathway, another set of differential
variability methods has been developed [28]. Differential
variability analysis determines a group of genes with a
significant change in variance of gene expression between
case and control groups [29]. This approach was further
extended and applied on the pathway level [28, 30, 31].
Recently, we developed OncoFinder, a new
biomathematical method for pathway analysis [32]
[33]. This method performs quantitative and qualitative
analysis of signaling pathway activation. For each
investigated sample, it performs a case-control pairwise
comparison and calculates PAS, a value which serves
as a qualitative measure of pathway activation. Unlike
most other methods, this approach takes into account
functional roles of all molecular participants of a
pathway, and determines if the signaling pathway is
significantly up- or down-regulated compared to the
reference. Negative and positive overall PAS values
correspond, respectively, to the inhibited or activated state
of a pathway. OncoFinder is also, to our knowledge, a
unique PAS calculating method, which provides output
data with significantly reduced noise introduced by the
experimental transcriptome profiling systems [33]. This
feature enables characterization of the functional states
of the transcriptomes and interactomes more accurately
than prior methods. It was also shown to be efficient in
finding new cancer biomarkers more stable than individual
gene expression patterns [34]. To date, OncoFinder has
demonstrated usefulness in several applications including
leukemia and solid cancers [34-37], Hutchinson Gilford
Disease [38] and Age-Related Macular Degeneration
Disease [39].
Here, we present a novel approach for choosing an
optimal personalized treatment for cancer patients based
on high-throughput gene expression profiling of tumor
samples. We introduce a Drug Score (DS) as a measure of
effectiveness of a drug in a patient based on the rationale
that a drug needs to compensate the changes in pathway
activation/deactivation associated with cancer progression.
We use clinical trials data to validate this scoring system.
We compared the distribution of the predicted drug
efficacy scores for five drugs (Sorafenib, Bevacizumab,
Cetuximab, Sorafenib, Imatinib, Sunitinib) and seven
cancer types (Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Colon
cancer, Lung adenocarcinoma, non-Hodgkin Lymphoma,
Lung Adenocarcinoma, Thyroid cancer and Sarcoma) with
the available clinical trials data for the respective drugs
and cancer types. The proportion of tumors for which high
drug scores were calculated with the proposed algorithm
correlated significantly with the percent of responders to
a drug treatment (Pearson’s correlation 0.77, p = 0.023).

Drug scoring algorithm
OncoFinder algorithm is based on the processing
of Pathway Activation Strength (PAS) signatures of
the cancer tissues under investigation. According to
OncoFinder method, PAS is calculated using expression
values of individual genes to investigate activation/
deactivation of intracellular signaling pathways [33].
PAS is defined as a weighted sum of logarithmic caseto-normal ratios (CNR), i.e. fold-change of expression
values of a gene in a biosample under study compared to
average expression value in control samples. Two types of
weighting coefficients are defined as indicators showing
(i) if a protein CNR value exceeds the confidence interval
(BTIFn, beyond tolerance interval flag); (ii) if a protein n
represses (-1 value) or promotes (+1 value) signaling in
the pathway p (ARRnp, activator/repressor role); (iii) if a
protein n is involved in pathway p (NIInp, node involvement
index).
Overall, PAS, or Pathway Activation Strength is
calculated according to the following formula [33], where
p represents the index of a pathway and n stays for the
index of a protein:

To construct a scoring function for a drug in a
patient, or DS, we define the following indicators:
AMCF flag (activation-to-mitosis conversion factor)
shows if the pathway activation promotes or inhibits
mitosis and cell survival:

DTI (drug-target index):
NII (node involvement index):
DS, which estimates the ability of a drug d to turn
cancer-related pathological changes in the transcriptome
of a tumor back to normal state is defined as follows:

In other words,
Briefly, DS can be understood as a sum of Pathway
Activation Scores (PAS) for the pathways in which
the targets of a drug are involved. The same PAS can
be summed up several times if a drug targets multiple
proteins involved in the pathway.
The given formula for DS is in principle applicable

for all target drugs, including small molecule inhibitors
(Nibs) and monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). With a
little modification, it might be also applied for scoring
monoclonal antibodies attached to cytotoxic agents, socalled Killer Mabs. In that case, a different definition of
Pathway Activation Strength can be used:

of corresponding normal tissues for 7 cancer types:
Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma, Colon cancer, Lung
adenocarcinoma, non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Thyroid
cancer and Sarcoma (Table 1). Table S1 summarizes the
best scoring targeted drugs for every cancer type under
study. Distributions of the DS are shown in Supplementary
Figure 1. In general, we observed that cancer types for
which target drug therapy is known to be efficient show
significantly higher drug scores: Clear Cell Renal Cell
Carcinomas and Thyroid tumors demonstrated high
scores for top-scoring drugs, whereas non-Hodgkin
lymphomas and lung adenocarcinomas showed lower
scores (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 1).
To investigate whether the DS successfully
predicts treatment efficacy, we analyzed publically
available clinical trials data from the ClinicalTrials
database (clinicaltrials.gov) and different human cancer
transcriptomes extracted from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/
geo/). We checked if the number of patients responding
and not responding to a treatment with a particular drug
in a particular cancer type (Table 2) could be explained
by the distribution of DS for that drug in patients with the
particular cancer type. We assumed that the higher number

PAS for killer Mabs is a reduced case of PAS where
AMCF and ARR indicators are set to 1. This reflects the
fact that despite the real biological role of a protein n in
signaling, its overexpression will attract cytotoxic agents
to tumor cells.

Validation of the Drug Scoring algorithm based
on tumor expression profiling and clinical trials
data
We calculated DS for 113 anticancer target drugs
extracted from the DrugBank database (http://www.
drugbank.ca/) for different cohorts of patients with
different cancer types. We investigated gene expression
in a total of 371 samples of tumors and control sets

of drug responders among the clinically investigated
group of particular cancer patients should correspond
to higher Drug Scores for the patients with same cancer
type. Moreover, we assumed that a cut-off value could be
chosen to distinguish the patients as responders or nonresponders to a particular treatment according to their gene
expression profile. We chose four cut-off values for DS
between 100 and 500 to assess the correlation between

the number of responders in a clinical trial and a predicted
number of responders in a GEO dataset. To avoid multiple
testing, only four cut-off values were tested (200, 250,
300, 350) and 250 was chosen as an optimal DS cut-off
value providing the best correlation between fraction of
responders in a clinical trial and fraction of patients with

41]. MS is considered a systemic autoimmune disease,
in which lymphocytes are immunoreactive against the
patient’s normal tissues [42]. We took the data on gene
expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS
patients and control patients (Table 1 section B). We
hypothesized that the drugs which could compensate
MS-specific changes in gene expression in peripheral
blood mononuclear cells could be beneficial for patients
suffering from MS. We prioritized the anticancer target
drugs according to the mean DS they had in MS patients.
The top five drugs identified in this assay are shown on
Table 3. Even though the database contained only anticancer drugs, the three of five top drugs identified were
previously studied as potential treatments of Multiple
Sclerosis and showed considerable beneficial effects
(Table 3).

several molecular pathways correlated strongly with the
mutation carrier status for the patients under investigation
(Supplementary Table 2)

DISCUSSION
Here we present a novel biomathematical
method, which has a potential to be universal tool for
predicting drug efficacy in the treatment of cancer via
characterization of tumor-related patterns in intracellular
signaling. It may have wide applicability, not only across
the range of cancer types, but also to individual samples
toward the goal of personalized cancer treatment. Unlike
most part of other approaches to drug scoring in cancer,
the current method does not require data on somatic
mutations in tumors, thus substantially reducing the costs
of an assay. Rather, it relies on advanced gene expression
analysis. Although the presence of mutations causing
loss and gain of function of certain regulator proteins is
an important factor in the prediction of clinical outcome
and treatment efficacy, a transcriptome-only approach
will still potentially detect these changes as expression
changes in downstream targets of the mutated regulator.
Moreover, because reliable methods for predicting the
effects of many specific somatic mutations (e.g. gain of
function) do not yet exist, results based on expression
data may be more biologically meaningful. As a proof
of concept, we have demonstrated that our approach
predicts the efficacy of Vemurafenib in melanoma samples
without knowing the mutation status of BRAF; indeed,
the prediction corresponded to presence of V600E gainof-function mutation. For several other cancer types,
we demonstrated the statistically significant advantage
of this approach in identification of the top target drugs
efficient for the respective cancer patients. On the model
of multiple sclerosis, we showed that the current method
of drug scoring is applicable also to non-tumor diseases.
The approach we report here is platform-independent, i.e.
any kind of high-throughput proteomic and transcriptomic
data may be used to estimate gene expression.

Drug score approach distinguishes between BRAF
wild type and V600E mutants in melanomas
Unlike other approaches to ranking drugs for
personalized cancer treatment, the algorithm suggested
here does not require preliminary data on somatic
mutations in tumors, thus substantially reduces the costs
of analysis. While identifying the presence of mutations
causing loss and gain of function of regulatory proteins is
frequently an important step in predicting clinical outcome
and treatment efficiency (e.g. BRAF V600E mutation)
[12], we show here that a transcriptome-only approach
also has the power to detect these changes at the gene
expression level for downstream targets of the mutated
regulator. Theoretically, the expression data may provide
even more biologically meaningful results, as reliable
methods for prediction of particular somatic mutations
(e.g., gain-of-function) do not exist to date, and many
mutations have limited or no phenotypic manifestations,
depending heavily on the enclosing genomic context [48].
To investigate the ability of our transcriptomebased drug scoring approach to distinguish between
tumors harboring different driver mutations, we explored
gene expression in melanoma patients. Vemurafenib is a
target drug that is effective for melanoma tumors with
V600E gain-of-function mutation in BRAF gene [12].
We compared DS for patients with wild type and V600E
BRAF melanomas (Table 1 section C). We demonstrated
that the percent of patients for whom Vemurafenib was
expected to be beneficial (those having a positive DS for
this drug) was significantly higher for the cohort of BRAF
V600E-mutated tumors (p(Fisher) = 0.042, Figure 2).
The reason why an expression-based approach
works well in this case is likely due to the ability to
detect expression changes introduced by transcriptional
reprogramming driven by the molecular consequences
of V600E BRAF mutation. Of note, activation profiles of
