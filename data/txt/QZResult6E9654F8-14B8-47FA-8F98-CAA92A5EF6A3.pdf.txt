ABSTRACT
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) represents the most common form
of pancreatic cancer with rising incidence in developing countries. Unfortunately,
the overall 5-year survival rate is still less than 5%. The most frequent oncogenic
mutations in PDAC are loss-of function mutations in p53 and gain-of-function
mutations in KRAS. Here we show that clofazimine (Lamprene), a drug already used
in the clinic for autoimmune diseases and leprosy, is able to efficiently kill in vitro
five different PDAC cell lines harboring p53 mutations. We provide evidence that
clofazimine induces apoptosis in PDAC cells with an EC50 in the µM range via its
specific inhibitory action on the potassium channel Kv1.3. Intraperitoneal injection
of clofazimine resulted in its accumulation in the pancreas of mice 8 hours after
administration. Using an orthotopic PDAC xenotransplantation model in SCID beige
mouse, we show that clofazimine significantly and strongly reduced the primary tumor
weight. Thus, our work identifies clofazimine as a promising therapeutic agent against
PDAC and further highlights ion channels as possible oncological targets.

diagnosis, six months is the expected survival period (for a
detailed review see e.g. [2]).
For about 20 years, the only therapeutic option
considered valid for the treatment of PDAC has been
5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Although the most widely used
chemotherapy drug is gemcitabine, administered alone
or in combination with other chemotherapeutics such
as 5-FU, capecitabine, platinum analogues and taxane
[3], currently FOLFIRINOX (mix of 5-fluorouracil,
leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin) has become a
promising first line therapy in patients [4]. The mechanism
of action by which the cytotoxic effect is exerted by
these molecules is the block of DNA synthesis; therefore
considerable side effects occur in the healthy tissues.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of
the most aggressive types of tumors, being the fourth leading
cause of cancer mortality. In general, patients are diagnosed
at a rather late stage of disease and their life expectancy is
at most five years after diagnosis. In most cases, the only
valid therapeutic approach is the radical surgical resection
of the tumor, which however is feasible only in 20% of the
cases, and recurrence of cancer lesions often occurs. Some
other patients (30-40%) show unresectable locally advanced
pancreatic cancer (LAPC) with a median survival of one year
[1]. For the rest of the patients, who manifest metastasis at

We have previously shown that in vitro inhibition of
mtKv1.3 using membrane-permeant Kv1.3 inhibitors such
as Psora-4, PAP-1 and clofazimine results in apoptosis of
various Kv1.3-expressing tumor cells [20, 28, 33]. These
drugs were efficient even in the case of poor-prognosis
tumor cells lacking Bax/Bak and bearing p53 mutations.
Importantly, this effect was observed exclusively with the
membrane-permeant inhibitors, indicating the importance
of the mtKv1.3 versus PM Kv1.3. Genetic deficiency or
siRNA-mediated downregulation of Kv1.3 abrogated the
effects of these substances. One of these specific drugs,
by targeting mtKv1.3, was able to reduce tumor volume
in vivo by 90% in a preclinical model of melanoma,
without side effects [28]. The drugs also killed primary
pathological B cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia
patients, without affecting survival of healthy T cells of
the same individuals [20]. The proposed mechanism of
action points to a synergistic effect between the altered
redox state, characteristic of tumor cells and the ability of
the above drugs to induce significant oxidative stress by
inhibiting mtKv1.3, leading finally to ROS-induced cell
death in the cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells alive.
Clofazimine blocks Kv1.3 channel activity with
an EC50 of 300 nM, while it is much less effective on
other potassium channels of the same Kv family [34].
However, for its apoptosis-inducing action a higher,
µM concentration is required, presumably due to the
accumulation of the drug in membranes other than the
IMM. Clofazimine is a lipophilic riminophenazine
antibiotic approved by the FDA and already in clinical
use to treat pathologies like leprosy and psoriasis; its
antibiotic, immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory
properties make it a versatile drug [35]. In light of the
results obtained with clofazimine on B-CLL cells and
in the orthotopic melanoma model, and of indications
of expression of Kv1.3 in pancreatic cancer tissues, we
investigated whether this drug can be used against PDAC
in an orthotopic xenograft model.

New molecules with aberrant expression in PDAC
tissues have recently emerged as possible alternative
targets in pancreatic tumor treatment. Among these are
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [5], human
epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) [6] and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [7]. For all of
them a phase II or III clinical trial has been conducted
but the improvement of outcome for PDAC patients is not
satisfactory. Therefore, new therapeutic approaches are
necessary.
During the last decade, ion channels emerged
as possible prognostic markers and therapeutic targets
against various types of cancer as indicated also by in
vivo studies in preclinical models [8, 9]. In particular,
potassium (K+) channels have been shown to be crucially
involved in many important physiological processes such
as proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, cell volume
regulation and apoptosis [10, 11] and to promote cancer
progression [12]. The voltage-gated potassium channel
Kv1.3 belongs to the Shaker family (Kv) and is expressed
in different tissues, such as brain, kidney, olfactory bulb,
lymphocytes, skeletal muscle, adipose tissue [13]. In
healthy individuals Kv1.3 is prevalently expressed mainly
in the CNS and in immune cells [14]. Aberrant (mostly
high) expression of Kv1.3 has instead been observed in
different types of tumors [13, 15], such as melanoma
[16], prostate [17], breast [18], B-cell lymphoma [19],
chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) [20, 21] gastric
[22], pancreatic tumor [23] and in lung cancer [24].
Overexpression of Kv1.3, like that of other Kv channels,
in cancer cells could give an advantage to cancer cells
enhancing tumorigenic processes such as proliferation,
cell migration and metastasis [10].
Kv1.3 is expressed and active both in the plasma
membrane (PM) and in the inner mitochondrial membrane
(IMM) of lymphocytes (mtKv1.3) [25], hippocampal
neurons [26] and in various tumor cells [27, 28]. Kv1.3
was located to the cis-Golgi membranes as well [29] and,
recently, to the nuclear membrane [30] where it seems to
be involved in regulation of transcription. Expression of
the channel in the IMM seems to correlate with that in the
PM (e.g. [27]), but while the plasma membrane Kv1.3 is
required for cell proliferation, the mitochondrial channel
regulates apoptosis. At the molecular level, mtKv1.3 is a
target of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, which inhibits the
channel via a conserved positive amino acid residue, lysine
128, with a Kv1.3-inhibiting toxin-like mechanism [31,
32]. Bax, or membrane permeant Kv1.3 inhibitors which
can reach the mitochondrial channel, block the positive
inward (toward the mitochondrial matrix) potassium
current, thereby determining a transient hyperpolarization
followed by the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS),
the opening of the permeability transition pore with
consequent loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and
release of cytochrome c, finally leading to the activation
of apoptotic cascade.

RESULTS
Kv1.3 is expressed in different human PDAC cell
lines
Since our purpose was to understand whether
clofazimine might be useful to induce apoptosis in
PDAC cell lines via inhibition of the mitochondrial
Kv1.3 channel, first we checked whether some of the
widely used human PDAC lines of various origin
express Kv1.3. To this end, we extracted information
available in a previously reported Affymetrix U133
GeneChip set [36, 37]. Analysis of the microarray data
shows that in 5 out of 8 lines expression of the Kcna3
gene encoding for Kv1.3 channel was relatively high
(Figure 1A). To confirm these data in the cell lines used
in our laboratories and to compare Kv1.3 expression

with that of a non-tumoral pancreatic ductal epithelial
line, we performed quantitative real time PCR using
multiple reference genes of the non-tumoral HPDE line
for normalization (Figure 1B). HPDE6-E6E7 (H6C7) is
a non-tumoral, immortalized human pancreatic ductal
epithelial cell line, generated by transformation with
human papilloma virus 16 (HPV-16). HPDE does not
have the typical characteristics of pathological cells
except a very fast growth kinetic. Cultured HPDE cells
express low levels of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR), erbB2, transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha,
Met/hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR), vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and keratinocyte
growth factor (KGF). HPDE was shown to be nontumorigenic when transplanted into SCID mice [38].

The human tumor lines that were used have
different origin and characteristics. All these lines have
been characterized in detail in several previous works
[39-41] and were found to be mutated in p53. Most of
them, with the exception of Bx PC-3, are mutated also in
K-RAS [41]. It is of note, that these cell lines, harboring
mutation in p53, have been found previously to be largely
resistant to standard chemotherapeutics. Mutations in the
p53 gene have been described in more than 50% of the
patient samples and there is evidence that the p53 network
is genetically altered in an even much higher proportion.
As PC-1 is a human pancreatic tumor cell line that was
derived from the metastatic site, an ascites, of a patient
with adenocarcinoma in the head of the pancreas. The

relative level of gene expression as determined by quantitative RT-PCR was calculated using qBase_Biogazelle software, which allows
a multiple reference genes-normalization and performs inter-run calibration. Actb and Ywhaz of non-tumoral HPDE cells were set as
reference genes (value 1) to normalize the gene expression. C. Whole cell extracts (50 µg/lane) from different PDAC cell lines were loaded
on SDS-PAGE. Western blot revealed Kv1.3 bands (multiple bands are presumably due to glycosylation according to manufacturer or to
degradation products) at around 65 kDa. These bands correlated with Kv1.3 expression since none of the bands were present in a cell line
silenced for Kv1.3 (not shown). The same blot was developed with the antibody against GAPDH (45 kDa) as loading control. D. Whole
cell extract (Tot ext), enriched membranous fraction (Memb) and Percoll-purified mitochondria (mitos) fractions obtained from Colo357
were loaded at equal protein concentration (40 µg/lane). Enrichment in the mitochondrial marker Bak and decrease of the intensity of
SERCA (ER marker) and PMCA (PM marker) indicates a higher purity of the mitochondrial preparation. Results in C-D are representative
of Western blots from three independent experiments.

similar to those of human PDAC, with abundant mucin
production and granular differentiation. Bx PC-3 is a
primary human pancreatic tumor cell line from the body
of the pancreas of a patient with adenocarcinoma. These
cells are not prone to give metastasis and they are poorly
differentiated. The Bx PC-3 nude mice tumor model also
shows characteristics close to those of human PDAC with
mucin production and displays moderately differentiated
adenocarcinomas with occasional lymphocytic infiltrations
at the tumor peripheries. Colo357 cells originate from a
lymph node metastasis from a PDAC patient and display
p53 mutation (Trauzold et al, unpublished result). They
express low levels of Bcl-xL, are highly metastatic and are
moderately differentiated. Capan-1 PDAC line, originally
obtained from liver metastasis, is highly resistant to
different chemotherapeutic drugs, in particular to 5-FU.
Tumor models using Capan-1 show a well-differentiated
adenocarcinoma with abundant mucin production. The
poorly differentiated Mia PaCa 2 cell line was initially
obtained from the body and tail of the pancreas of a PDAC
patient, while the metastatic Panc-1 line was isolated from
the head of the pancreas. This tumor had invaded the
duodenal wall of the patient and expresses a high level of
the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL [42]. To confirm that Kv1.3 was
expressed also at protein level, we performed Western blot
analysis on whole-cell extracts (Figure 1C), revealing the
presence of the channel protein in all cell lines. Finally,
in one of these lines, namely in Colo357 which was
used for the in vivo studies in this paper (see below), we
assessed mitochondrial expression of Kv1.3. Purity of the
mitochondrial fraction is indicated by the low intensity
of PM (PMCA) and ER (SERCA) markers. In contrast,
the band intensity of the mitochondrial marker Bak
(Figure 1D) is high in the mitochondrial fraction which
also contains Kv1.3. Altogether, these results indicate the
presence of Kv1.3 in different PDAC cell lines.

substantially decreased the cell-survival reducing effect
of clofazimine (Figure 2C). This decrease took place
to different extents in the two lines, suggesting that Bx
PC-3 lines display a higher basal ROS level. These results
suggest that apoptosis induced by clofazimine does not
depend exclusively on the level of Kv1.3 expression
but also on the basal redox state which might slightly
differ between the different cell lines used in this study.
For wt Colo357 cells, the EC50 for clofazimine-induced
cell survival decrease was 1.5 µM. Although this value
increased to 6 µM in Bcl-xL-overexpressing cells [43],
there was still a significant impairment of cell survival at
the highest concentration of clofazimine (Figure 2D). This
result is in agreement with the action of clofazimine on
the IMM-located mtKv1.3, i.e. downstream and largely
independent of the OMM-located Bcl-2 family members.
In addition, we tested whether hypoxic conditions,
typically found in solid tumors and also in PDAC [44],
affect the apoptosis-inducing ability of the drug, which
was not the case. Metabolic reprogramming from
mitochondrial aerobic respiration to aerobic glycolysis is
a hallmark of many types of cancer. Galactose is not used
efficiently as glycolytic substrate, therefore the cells need
to switch their metabolism to produce all of their energy
from oxidative phosphorylation for survival. The switch
of the medium did not impact on the in vitro effect of
clofazimine (Figure 2E).
In order to prove that reduction of cell survival
correlated with increased apoptosis and that clofazimine
induced cell death via its action on Kv1.3, we analysed
Annexin binding in Bx PC-3 and As PC-1 cells
transiently transfected either with scrambled RNA or
with siRNA against Kv1.3 (Figure 3A and 3B). In both
cell lines clofazimine-induced apoptosis and Annexin
binding was evident after treatment with 10 µM
clofazimine, even without addition of MDR inhibitors (in
agreement with Figure 2A) when Kv1.3 is expressed, but
upon silencing of the channel expression the drug was not
effective anymore. Staurosporine was used as positive
control, and in agreement with data of Figure 2A, this
assay confirmed the resistance of As PC-1 cells to this
classical apoptosis-inducer, as well as the sensitivity of
Bx PC-3 cells. Similar results were obtained also with
Colo357 cells (Figure 3C).

Clofazimine decreases cell survival in PDAC
lines harbouring p53 mutations but spares nontumoral lines
Next, we studied the effect of clofazimine in the
above PDAC lines in a previously used setting to induce
apoptosis. Figure 2A shows that while HPDE and the
human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVEC were
resistant to 10 µM clofazimine, basically all PDAC
lines, even those that are resistant to 4 µM Staurosporine
(PANC-1, AsPC-1, Capan-1 and Mia PaCa 2), responded
to this concentration of clofazimine with a significant
reduction of cell survival. Membrane impermeant toxins
(Mgtx and Shk) act prevalently on the PM-Kv1.3 and, as
expected, were unable to reduce cell survival in different
PDAC lines (Figure 2B). In accordance with the proposed
mechanism of action, pre-treatment of Colo357 and Bx
PC-3 cells with membrane-permeant catalase and/or a
mitochondrially targeted ROS scavenger (MitoTEMPO)

To further prove the relevance of our findings in
vivo, we treated severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)

human Colo357 cells with intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected
clofazimine ten times, starting 10 days after tumor cell
inoculation and continued every second day (Figure 4A).

established inoculation protocol for Colo357 [45] and

significant reduction by more than 50% of tumor weight
occurred in the clofazimine-treated mice compared to
the control mice treated with the solvent (Figure 4B).
Instead, no difference in the number of liver metastasis
occurred in the clofazimine-treated animals with respect
to controls (Figure 4C). In order to prove that clofazimine
reaches the pancreatic tissue, we determined the
clofazimine concentration in various tissues. Following
i.p. administration of a single dose of clofazimine, it was
found to be readily absorbed. Low concentrations of the
drug were detected in blood. HPLC−UV−ESI/MS analysis
of whole tissues showed that clofazimine was basically
absent in the brain indicating that it does not readily cross
the blood brain barrier and was accumulated only to a

low extent in the heart. In the pancreas, kidney, liver and
spleen, relatively high concentrations of clofazimine were
found (Figure 4D).
Next, we performed an immunohistochemical
staining in order to characterize the orthotopic tumor
tissues. The morphology of the tissues was examined
via hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Figure 5).
We further analysed the tumor area, proliferation and
angiogenesis via staining of the tissue with antibodies
against KL1, CD31 (Figure 5) and Ki67 (Figure 6),
respectively. The anti-human KL1 antibody recognizes
many-cytokeratins and binds to cells of epithelial
origin. Therefore, it stains neoplastic cells of human
and epithelial origin (i.e. of Colo357) and permits the

PDAC-derived tissue from the murine pancreas. AntiCD31 recognizes the platelet endothelial cell adhesion
molecule (CD31), a protein which is constitutively
expressed on the surface of embryonic and endothelial
cells (also monocytes and neutrophils) and represents
a marker of angiogenesis. These markers highlighted
the presence of larger mucinous lobules in the
clofazimine-treated pancreas tissues, but only minor

differences regarding tumor structure and angiogenesis
were observed between the control and drug-treated
groups. Anti-Ki67 recognizes a nuclear protein which
is highly expressed in proliferating cells, in particular
during late G1-S-M and G2 phases of the cell cycle.
Quiescent cells (G0 phase) are negative for this protein.

that clofazimine, a drug already used in the clinic is
able to substantially reduce pancreatic tumor growth in

Clofazimine is an FDA-approved anti-mycobacterial
agent recommended by the World Health Organization
as part of the standard treatment of leprosy [35]. The
use of drugs that have been developed for one disorder
and ‘repositioning’ them to tackle another pathology
is an increasingly important strategy for researchers in
industry and academia [46]. Clofazimine has been in

clinical use since the 1960s and is well-tolerated, although
bioaccumulation of the drug can lead to visible (but
reversible) changes in skin pigmentation. It possesses antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, therefore
it is used in various cutaneous, non-microbial, and chronic
inflammatory disorders. In addition, clofazimine has
recently been reported to exert potent antifungal activity by

inducing a PKC1-dependent stress [47]. More recent studies
suggested an expansion of the clinical use of clofazimine
to non-cutaneous inflammatory disorders such as multiple
sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and type I diabetes mellitus
[35]. Despite its known anti-inflammatory activity, the
molecular and cellular mechanisms that underlie this
property of clofazimine have not been fully elucidated.
We have previously shown that clofazimine is able
to induce apoptosis both in primary human tumor cells
and in vivo, in an orthotopic melanoma model. Inhibition
of mtKv1.3 increases mitochondrial ROS production.
When pathological B lymphocytes [20] and PDAC cells
(Figure 2C) were pre-treated with membrane-permeant
ROS scavengers, mtKv1.3 inhibitors failed to induce
apoptosis. These experiments suggest that mtKv1.3
inhibition-induced ROS release is necessary for triggering
programmed cell death. Since an elevated basal ROS level
is known to occur in cancer cells [48, 49], we propose
that the clofazimine-induced ROS release drives PDACs
over a critical threshold of oxidative stress, causing cell
death [50, 51]. In contrast, oxidative stress in healthy cells
would not reach the critical threshold, accounting for the
cancer-selective action of clofazimine. Beside its action
on mtKv1.3, clofazimine inhibits the PM Kv1.3, known
to be required for cell proliferation at least in some cell
types [14, 24]. Thus, a priori, clofazimine might reduce
tumor progression by decreasing proliferation. However
the slight reduction of the Ki67 index in the examined
tumor tissues suggests that tumor reduction was due to the
apoptosis-inducing effect of the applied drug.
In our studies we obtained evidence that clofazimine
induced PDAC apoptosis prevalently due to its action on
the mitochondrial channel, since membrane-impermeant
drugs inhibiting only the PM Kv1.3 did not trigger cell
death. Mitochondrial potassium channels are known
to importantly impact respiration and bioenergetic
efficiency of these organelles and as a consequence,
ATP production and cell fate [52]. Two observations
indicate that mitochondrial function is required for PDAC
tumors to develop and grow. First, metformin, an antidiabetic drug with multiple effects inhibits oxidative
phosphorylation (by inhibiting mitochondrial complex
I). Metformin exposure has been shown to significantly
decrease mitochondrial transmembrane potential, to
increase mitochondrial ROS production [53] and to impair
PDAC proliferation. Second, a recent study identified a
subpopulation of PDACs which was able to survive
oncogene ablation and was responsible for tumor relapse.
This subpopulation relies on oxidative phosphorylation
rather than on glycolysis for cellular energetics and
survival. Accordingly, these cells showed high sensitivity
to oligomycin, an inhibitor of oxidative phosphorylation.
Oligomycin was shown to inhibit tumor recurrence and to
increase overall survival rate in vivo [54]. Thus, alteration
of mitochondrial function, e.g. via modulation of ion
fluxes indeed can represent a valid strategy against PDAC.

It must be however mentioned that clofazimine,
similarly to metformin is a drug with multiple targets
and additional mechanisms accounting for its antitumoral effect must be taken into account. For
example, clofazimine has recently been identified in a
large-scale screening as an inhibitor of Wnt signaling
[55], the pathway playing an important role in PDAC
tumor initiation and progression [56, 57]. Clofazimine
was shown to decrease proliferation of HTB19 triplenegative breast cancer cells whose growth is Wnt
pathway-dependent. The authors also reported that
clofazimine exerted a significantly smaller effect on
non-cancerous mammary epithelial cells (HMEC)
than on HTB19 cells, providing thus a further case of
selective action on tumoral versus non-tumoral cells
[55]. In addition, clofazimine has been shown to exert
an inhibitory action on ABCB1/MDR1/P-glycoproteins
(Pgp) [58], although this aspect is particularly relevant
when applied together with chemotherapeutics to
chemo-resistant cells (e.g. [59]). Finally, clofazimine
has been shown via bioinformatic screening to have
the potential to inhibit p53–MDM2 interaction leading
in turn to stabilization and activation of the tumor
suppressor p53 [60, 61]. However, in our experimental
setting clofazimine induced cell death independently
of the p53 status in several cell lines. This finding is
particularly relevant given that most PDACs display
p53 mutation.
Independently of the exact mechanism of action,
in our experiments clofazimine substantially reduced
PDAC tumor weight. This ability of clofazimine is in
agreement with previous in vivo studies obtained in other
types of cancer such as hepatocellular carcinoma [62] and
melanoma [28]. In those studies the effect of the drug on
metastasis was not assessed. The present report suggests
that clofazimine might be taken into consideration for
reduction of the primary tumor site only, since it did
not reduce liver metastasis. The question arises why
clofazimine was less effective in the PDAC model with
respect to e.g. the melanoma model. We hypothesize
that this result may reflect the well-known difficulty of
drugs in general to reach PDAC tissues due to the stromal
barrier, i.e. a dense extracellular matrix composed of
hyaluronic acid, smooth muscle actin and collagen fibers
[63, 64]. At the dosages used for the leprosy treatment,
with oral administration, the plasma concentrations of
the drug reaches 0.5–1 µM [65]. However, a study on
tissue concentrations found clofazimine ranging from 0.2
mg/g to 1.5 mg/g (approximately up to 500 µM) in the
different organs of a human patient (a value of 0.4 mg/g
was obtained for pancreas) [66], which is in agreement
with the finding that the drug is generally harmless for
normal tissues of the organism. While in the present
study a relatively high concentration of clofazimine was
found in the pancreas of control animals, it is plausible
to suppose that an analogous level could not be reached

in PDAC pancreas because of the stromal barrier.
Indeed, in a representative experiment with PDAC tumor
tissue, we found 3-fold less clofazimine than in the
pancreas of healthy mouse (not shown). Furthermore,
clofazimine is a rather insoluble molecule: indeed it has
been shown to form crystals in the kidney and, during
long-term oral administration, to massively accumulate
in macrophages, where it forms insoluble, intracellular
crystal-like drug inclusions (CLDIs). Recently, it has
been reported that in vitro, the dissolved fraction of
clofazimine was cytotoxic because it depolarized
mitochondria and induced apoptosis in macrophages
[67] while in vivo, CLDIs did not induce macrophage
apoptosis. Instead, CLDIs altered immune signaling
response pathways downstream of Toll-like receptor
(TLR) ligation, leading to decreased NF-κB activation
and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) production and
to enhanced interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA)
production. Thus, the authors concluded that in vivo,
macrophages detoxify soluble clofazimine by sequestering
it in a biocompatible, insoluble form and this may
contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of the drug.
Interestingly, we have recently demonstrated the crucial
role of TNFα in the malignancy of PDAC. We found that
TNFα strongly increased invasiveness of Colo357 cells
in vitro and dramatically enhanced tumor growth and
metastasis in vivo [68]. Furthermore, in severe combined
immunodeficient mice with orthotopically growing PDAC
tumors, the human-specific anti-TNF antibody infliximab
reduced tumor growth and metastasis by about 30% and
50%, respectively. Thus, it is possible that the observed
tumor-reducing effect of clofazimine is due to multiple
factors, including apoptosis induction of PDAC cells but
also to an indirect effect via modulation of macrophage
function even in SCID mice. While clofazamine affects
tumor growth in the SCID mice, in animals with
functional immunity, a priori, Kv1.3 inhibition might
adversely alter the function of the immune system [14],
leading to a diminished anti-cancer immunity. In our
previous study, clofazimine treatment in vivo did not cause
alteration of blood parameters, but anti-cancer immunity
was not investigated [20]. Therefore, this issue needs to be
addressed in future work.
In conclusion, our work provides evidence
that clofazimine might be a useful agent against
PDAC, possibly in combination with currently used
chemotherapeutics or newly identified PDAC growth
inhibitors such as infliximab. This possibility will
have to be addressed in future studies. In addition,
combination with other drugs targeting ion channels
and/or ion transporters might be a strategy worth
pursuing. In fact, thanks to excellent recent works,
several proteins mediating transmembrane flux of ions
have been identified as possible therapeutic targets in
PDAC. For example, hERG1 potassium channels have
been shown to drive PDAC tumor malignancy [69], the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

neurotransmitter GABA was identified as a promising
agent for the prevention of PDAC in individuals at risk
due to chronic alcohol consumption [70], the transient
receptor potential melastatin-related 7 channel was found
to regulate tumor migration [71], the store-operated
calcium channels (SOCs) were shown to contribute to
PDAC apoptosis resistance [72] while the P2X7 receptor
regulates cell survival, migration and invasion [73].
Ion transporters which regulate pH are also relevant in
this context [74, 75] - e.g. we have recently shown that
the specific sodium-proton exchanger NHE1 inhibitor
cariporide reduced both three-dimensional growth and
invasion and synergistically sensitized these behaviours
to low doses of erlotinib [76]. Thus, in an ideal situation,
a combined therapy bypassing basic mechanisms
responsible for cancer progression and chemoresistance
e.g. [77] might be particularly useful.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines and cell culture
A panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines representing
different phases of tumor progression were used. As
PC-1, Bx PC-3, Capan-1, Mia PaCa-2 and Panc-1 were
provided by ATCC. As PC-1 and Bx PC-3 were cultured
in RPMI-1640 (Gibco/Life Technologies, Darmstadt,
Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum “GOLD” (FBS “GOLD”, PAA Laboratories/
GE Healthcare Life Sciences), 1mM GlutaMAX and 1
mM sodium pyruvate (LifeTechnologies, Darmstadt,
Germany). Mia PaCa-2 and Panc-1 were cultured in
DMEM (4.5 g/l D-glucose) supplemented with 10% FBS
“GOLD”, 1mM GlutaMAX and 1 mM sodium pyruvate.
Capan-1 cells were grown in IMEM supplemented
with 20% FBS “GOLD”, 1mM GlutaMAX and 1 mM
sodium pyruvate. Human cell line of metastatic pancreas
adenocarcinoma, Colo357, was obtained from Dr. R.
Morgan (Denver, CO) [78]. The cells were cultured in
a complete growth medium composed of RPMI-1640,
10% FCS (PAN-Biotech, Aidenbach, Germany), 1 mM
GlutaMAX and 1 mM sodium pyruvate. The HPV16E6E7 - immortalized human pancreatic duct epithelial
cells (HPDE), kindly provided by Dr. Ming-Sound Tsao
(Ontario Cancer Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada)
[79] were used as a model for benign pancreatic ductal
epithelium. The complete growth HPDE-medium
was mixed with 50% RPMI 1640, supplemented with
10% FCS and 1mM GlutaMAX and 50% keratinocyte
medium SFM (Gibco) supplemented with 0.025% bovine
pituitary extract, 2.5 µg l-1 epidermal growth factor
(Gibco). All cells were cultivated and maintained at 37°C
in a humid water-saturated atmosphere with 5% CO2. All
cell lines were genetically monitored by finger printing.
Colo357, As PC-1, Bx PC-3, Capan-1, Mia PaCa-2 and
Panc-1 were approved by IonTrac consortium.

PC-3) were seeded in 96 well plates in 200 µL of medium.
After 24 h the cells were pre-incubated for 1 h with ROS
scavengers, e.g. MitoTEMPO and PEG-Catalase either
alone or in combination, using different concentrations as
indicated in the figure. Afterwards, cells were treated with
5 or 10 µM clofazimine for further 24 hs. After incubation,
20 µL of MTT solution (Cell titer Aqueous solution,
Promega) was added in each well and formazan formation
was determined by measuring absorbance at 490 nm with
an Infinite 200 Pro NanoQuant plate reader (Tecan).

Membrane enriched fraction proteins from
different Pancreatic cell lines were obtained as previously
reported [80]. Briefly, cells were washed in PBS and then
resuspended in 300 μL of TES buffer (100 mM TES + 1 M
sucrose + 100 mM EGTA + 1X cocktail protease inhibitors)
and lysed by an electric pestle (Kontes, Sigma Aldrich) for 2
min on ice. Unbroken cells were separated by centrifugation
at 500 g for 10 min at 4°C. The soluble cytosolic fraction
was separated from the membrane-enriched fraction by
centrifugation at 19,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The pelleted
membranes were suspended in TES buffer and separated
by SDS-PAGE in a 10% polyacrylamide gel containing
6 M Urea. To enhance protein separation, samples were
solubilized for 1 h at RT in Sample Buffer (30% Glycerol
+ 125 mM Tris/HCl pH 6.8 + 9% SDS + 0.1 M DTT +
Bromophenol blue). Protein concentration was determined
using the BCA method in a 96 well plate (200 μL total
volume for each well) incubating at 37°C in the dark for
30 min. Absorbance at 540 nm was measured by a Packard
Spectra Count 96 well plate reader. After separation by
electrophoresis, gels were blotted overnight at 4°C onto
Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. After blocking
with a 10% solution of defatted milk, the membranes were
incubated overnight at 4°C with the following primary
antibodies : anti-Kv1.3 (1:200, rabbit polyclonal, Alamone
Labs APC-101); anti-GAPDH (1:1000, mouse monoclonal,
Millipore MAB374). After washing, the membranes were
developed using corresponding anti-mouse or anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (Calbiochem). Antibody signal was
detected with enhanced chemiluminescence substrate
(SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate,
Thermo Scientific).

siRNA
The sequences for the siRNA targeting human
Kv1.3 were coupled to Alexa Fluo 555 (Qiagen). 80,000
cells/well (Colo357, Bx PC-3, As PC-1) were seeded into
a 12 well plate in 1 mL of the growth medium. After 24
h cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg siRNA/well
using Lipofectamine 2000 as suggested by the supplier.
After 48 h from transfection, cells were treated for 24 h
more with the drugs, as indicated. Cell death, evaluated by
the binding of FITC-labelled Annexin V, as well as siRNA
transfection were determined using a DMI4000 Leica
fluorescence microscope.

Purification of mitochondria
Mitochondria from Colo357 cells were purified
by differential centrifugation as in [28]. Briefly,
approximately 80% confluent cells from eight 150-cm2
flasks were washed once with PBS, detached by gentle
scraping and spun down in a table centrifuge at room
temperature. The pellet was resuspended in sucrose/N[81]-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (TES) buffer (300 mM
sucrose, 10 mM TES, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH 7.4). After
standing for 30 min on ice, cells were lysed in a Dounce
homogenizer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 600
x g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was again processed
in the same way to maximize recovery. The combined
supernatants were centrifuged once at 600 x g, and
the pellet was discarded. The mitochondria-containing
supernatant from the last step was centrifuged at 8,000 x
g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was gently homogenized
and suspended in a small volume of TES buffer. A further
purification was obtained by centrifugation (8,500 x g,
10min, 4°C) on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (60, 30
and 18% Percoll in TES buffer). The floating material
was discarded, and the fraction at the lower interface
was collected and washed three times by centrifugation
at 19,000 x g for 5 min. The final pellet was resuspended
in TES buffer.

MTT assay
To determine cell growth/viability in PDAC cells,
we employed the tetrazolium reduction (MTT) assay. To
this end, 10,000/well PDAC cells were seeded in standard
96-well plates and allowed to grow in the medium
normally used for each line (200 µl) for 24 h. The growth
medium was then replaced with fresh phenol red-free
medium. Four wells were used for each condition. After
24 h incubation with the indicated drugs 10% CellTiter
96 AQUEOUS One solution (Promega) was added to
each well. After 1-3 h of colour development at 37°C,
absorbance at 490 nm was measured using a Packard
Spectra Count 96-well plate reader as in [78]. Anaerobiosis
was obtained by reducing oxygen percentage to less than
1% by inflating nitrogen in a modular incubator chamber
(Billups-Rothemberg, USA). Metabolism was altered
growing the cells (seeded 3,000/well) for three days in a
DMEM lacking glucose but supplemented with galactose,
before treatment with the indicated drugs. For experiments
with ROS scavangers, 7,500 cells (both Colo357 and Bx

data set [37]. It consisted of more than 44,000 probes
sets detecting 33,000 genes and ESTs. The samples
comprised microdissected freshly frozen tissue from
PDAC and normal pancreatic tissue. Additionally, a panel
of malignant pancreatic cell lines (Capan-2, Bx PC-3,
Capan-1, As pc-1, COLO-357, Mia PaCa 2, Panc-1, Panc89, PT-45, Panc-TUI) and benign stromal cell lines (Kif5,
F13 and immortalized primary stellate cells) were also
included. The microarray data processing was performed
as previously reported [37]. We extracted the expression
value of the Kv1.3 in the different pancreatic malignant
cell lines with a special emphasis on the lines that were
used in the current study.

care were carried out in accordance with the guidelines of
institutional authorities and approved by local authorities
(number V312-7224.121-7(123-10/11)).

Orthotopic xenograft of human adenocarcinoma
cells and treatment
The orthotopic injection was performed as
previously described [82]. Human metastatic pancreas
adenocarcinoma cells Colo357 were detached with
Accutase solution (PAA Laboratories GmbH),
resuspended at the concentration of 106 cells ml-1 in 25
µl of Matrigel (BD-Biosciences) and stored on ice. After
median laparotomy, 25 µl of cell suspension were injected
in the tail of the pancreas. For the therapy, the animals
were randomly designated to the treatment procedure: (1)
no treatment, (2) clofazimine treatment. The therapy was
initiated ten days after tumor inoculation and spanned 20
days. Clofazimine was freshly dissolved at [2.5 mM] in
DMSO and sterile water for injection (Ampuwa, FreseniusKabi, Germany). For the therapy, it was administered in a
dose of 5µg/g (10 nmol/g) intraperitoneally. The control
group was treated with a solution containing DMSO and
physiological saline buffer. All animals were examined
daily for general signs of distress and complications.
Thirty days after cell inoculation, the animals were
sacrificed and tumor weight was determined after blood
removal. Thereafter, the tumors were cut into two equal
parts, which were directly either frozen in liquid nitrogen
or formalin-fixed and later paraffin-embedded (FFPE).
The mice were carefully inspected for any macroscopic
metastases in liver, spleen, and mesenterium. Furthermore,
several organs were embedded in paraffin for histological
staining and analysis.

Quantitative real time PCR
Total RNA was isolated from culture cells 24
hours after seeding. The total RNA was purified using
peqGOLD Total RNA kit and treated with DNase I
(PEQLAB Biotechnology GmbH) for removing residual
DNA. RNA concentration was measured using a
Nanodrop spectrophotometer (PEQLAB Biotechnology
GmbH) and the quality of the extracted RNA was
checked on 1% agarose gel. 1 µg of RNA was reverse
transcribed into cDNA with Maxima First Strand
cDNA Synthesis kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Realtime PCR was performed in a total volume of 20 µl
using 50 ng of the first-strand cDNA synthesis mixture
as template. The assay was done with Double-dye
(Taqman technology) probes; the exon-exon spanning
primers sequence for Kcna3 (Kv1.3) was supplied by
Primerdesign Ltd (Southampton, United Kingdom).
The amplification reaction was run in a StepOnePlus
Real-time machine according to the follow conditions:
Taqman enzyme activation at 95°C, 10 min; denaturation
at 95°C, 15 sec, annealing at 50°C, 30 sec; extension at
72°C, 15 sec (fifty cycles). The relative quantification
of gene expression was calculated with the help of
qBase Browser (Biogazelle NV, Zwijnaarde, Belgium)
by applying the comparative CT method with a multiple
reference gene normalization. Actb and Ywhaz were
set as reference genes to normalize gene expression;
HPDE cells were used as reference sample to determine
Kcna3 relative expression (fold change) in the panel of
pancreatic cancer cell lines.

Immunohistochemistry
Primary tumor samples from paraffin-embedded
tissue were cut into 3µm sections and mounted onto
slides. The specimen were tested for pan-cytokeratin
(KL1, Beckman Coulter, mouse monoclonal 1:1500),
Ki-67 (SP6, ThermoScientific, rabbit monoclonal 1:300)
and CD31 (SZ31, Dianova, anti-mousemonoclonal
1:30). The immunohistochemistry (IHC) was carried out
according the following procedure: de-paraffinization
with xylene, rehydration in descending concentrations
of ethanol, followed by heat-induced epitope retrieval
with sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0). Washing steps were
performed at room temperature with tris-buffered saline
(TBS); to avoid non-specific binding of the antibody
to the tissues, all specimen were incubated with POD
(Peroxidase-blocking solution, Dako) for fifteen minutes.
The primary diluted antibodies (antibody diluent, DCS
LabLine, Hamburg, Germany) were applied and the
samples were kept in a humidified chamber for one hour.

Laboratory animals
Four weeks old females SCID beige (C.B.-17.
Cg-Prkdcscid Lystbb/Crl) mice weighting 14-19 g were
obtained from Charles River (Sulzfeld, Germany). They
were housed in a sterile environment and allowed to
acclimatize for one week. The animal experiments and

For detection, the tissues were incubated with HPRconjugate anti-rabbit/mouse (Dako) and Mouse-PO
anti-rat for thirty minutes; subsequently, the substrate
chromogen-DAB (Dako) was added and the staining
developed for five minutes. Finally, the samples were
counterstained with Hematoxylin (Dako) and dehydrated
with ascending concentrations of ethanol and rinsed in
xylene. To test the proliferation activity of the tumors
in both control and clofazimine-treated samples, the Ki67 nuclear staining was evaluated by an experienced
pathologist who performed the Ki-67 % scoring. Briefly,
for each tumor sample the areas with a positive staining
(hot spot) were selected. In the selected field, the cells
showing nuclei with weak intensity of the staining
were regarded as Ki-67 positive cells and counted at
40X magnification. Finally, the Ki-67 % scoring was
determined as number of positive cells compared to the
total number of nuclei in the corresponding area. Slides
were scanned with Scn400 Image Viewer software
(Leica, Solms, Germany). Tumors samples were screened
at 10X magnification. The areas with a higher positive
staining for CD31- as vascular hot spots- were further
examined at 20X magnification to observe the vascular
structures.

(190-500 nm). Solvents A and B were water containing
0.1% TFA (trifluoroacetic acid) and acetonitrile,
respectively. The gradient for B was as follow: 10% for
0.5 min, then from 10 to 100% in 4.5 min, 100% for 1
min; the flow rate was 0.6 mL/min.

Determination of clofazimine concentration in
tissues

GRANT SUPPORT

Clofazimine (10 nmol/g) was injected i.p. into
control mice. 24 hours after last injection the animals
were sacrificed and blood and various tissues were
collected. Up to 100 mg of each tissue were weighted
precisely, PBS (1 vol) was added, and the tissue sample
was cut into small pieces and homogenized with an
electric pestle. 100 µM 5-methoxypsoralen (5-MOP) in
acetone (0.1 vol) was added as internal reference and
clofazimine was then extracted adding 4.35 M acetic acid
(0.1 vol) and acetone (10 vol). Each sample was vortexed
(2 min), sonicated (2 min), and centrifuged (12,000 g,
7 min, 4°C); the supernatant was collected, concentrated
using a Univapo 150H (Uniequip) vacuum concentrator,
and finally analyzed via HPLC-UV according to
established protocols previously used for other drugs
[83]. Blood samples (80-100 μL) were obtained from the
sacrificed animals and collected in heparinized tubes,
kept in ice, and treated within 10 min. Blood treatment is
was slightly different to from that applied to the organs:
100 µM 5-MOP (0.1 vol) was added as internal reference
and clofazimine extracted adding 0.6 M acetic acid (0.1
vol) and acetone (4 vol). The samples were sonicated
(2 min), and centrifuged (12,000 g, 7 min, 4°C) and
then processed as just described. Recovery yields of
clofazimine were determined as described in [83, 84].
HPLC analysis was performed with a 1290 Infinity LC
system (Agilent Technologies) using a reverse phase
column (Zorbax Extend-C18), 3.0 x 50mm, 1.8 micron,
