BACKGROUND. Tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) is a putative mediator of the
cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome. The current study was designed to determine whether etanercept (a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular
ligand-binding portion of the human 75-kilodalton TNF receptor linked to the Fc
portion of human immunoglobulin [Ig] G1) could palliate this syndrome.

etanercept had higher rates of neurotoxicity (29% vs 0%) but lower rates of anemia (0% vs 19%) and thrombocytopenia (0% vs 14%). Infection rates were negligible in both groups. Genotyping for TNF-a-238 and TNF-a-308 polymorphisms
revealed no clinical significance for these genotypes, except for a preliminary
association between presence of the 2238 G/A genotype and relatively less favorable survival.

result of such efforts, the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)

Etanercept for Cancer-Related Anorexia/Jatoi et al.

Several lines of investigation point to the pivotal
role of TNF-a in this syndrome and to the potential
for gleaning therapeutic and palliative value as a
result of its inhibition. First, Llovera et al. found that
when Lewis lung cancer was implanted into TNF-a
knockout mice deficient in this cytokine, the rates of
protein degradation were lower compared with those
observed in wild-type mice with implanted tumors.3
Similarly, the ubiquitin-proteasome system was activated to a lesser degree, an observation that is of significance when one considers that this system
appears to be responsible for approximately 80% of
muscle wasting in cancer patients.4 These findings,
coupled with evidence that links TNF, NF-j-B, and
the essential muscle transcription factor MyoD, provide a clear mechanistic pathway with which to
explain how this inflammatory cytokine might give
rise to muscle wasting and weight loss.2,5 Second,
Torelli et al. tested a dimeric, pegylated 55-kilodalton
(kD) TNF-a receptor construct that acted as a TNF-a
inhibitor.6 Tumor-bearing mice that received the receptor construct ate better and gained more weight
compared with those that received only vehicle.
These compelling preclinical data raise the possibility
that these same favorable effects might be observed
among anorexic cancer patients who continue to
lose weight. Third, TNF-a inhibitors are now clinically available. For example, etanercept, a dimeric
fusion protein, binds to TNF-a in vivo and thereby
blocks its interaction with cell surface receptors. This
agent has been extensively studied in the clinical setting and represents a standard therapy for patients
with rheumatoid arthritis.7 Thus, preclinical data and
the timely availability of TNF-a inhibitors provided
the rationale for and the feasibility of testing TNF-a
inhibition in a clinical setting for the treatment of
the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome.
Therefore, the North Central Cancer Treatment
Group (NCCTG) conducted a placebo-controlled
study with etanercept in patients with the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome. The purpose of the current study was to explore proof-of-concept that TNFa inhibition provides a means to palliate the cancer
anorexia/weight loss syndrome.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Overview
All sites within the North Central Cancer Treatment
Group were provided the opportunity to enroll
patients on this trial. The Institutional Review Boards
at each site approved the study protocol. All patients
provided informed, written consent prior to enrollment.

1397

Eligibility Criteria
The following patient eligibility criteria were to be
met at the time of study enrollment: 1) age 18
years; 2) histologic or cytologic proof of cancer other
than brain cancer; 3) life expectancy of >3 months
based on the judgment of the enrolling physician; 4)
an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance
score of 2 or better; 5) ability to administer subcutaneous medication twice weekly; 6) alert and mentally competent; 7) history of weight loss of 2.27 kg
over the preceding 2 months (documentation in the
medical record was not necessary) and/or an estimated caloric intake of <20 calories per kilogram of
body weight per day; 8) treating oncologist believed
that weight gain would be beneficial to the patient;
9) patient perceived weight loss as a problem; and
10) incurable malignancy. Patients were allowed to
begin or continue with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
In addition, a patient was considered ineligible
in the event of any 1 of the following: 1) currently
receiving enteral tube feedings or parenteral nutrition; 2) clinical evidence of ascites; 3) current (within
the past month) or planned treatment with adrenal
corticosteroids (inhaled or optical steroids were acceptable; the short-term use of dexamethasone
around the time of chemotherapy also was acceptable); 4) mechanical obstruction of the alimentary
canal, malabsorption, or intractable vomiting; 5)
pregnant, nursing, or of childbearing potential and
unwilling to employ contraception; 6) poorly controlled congestive heart failure or hypertension; 7)
use of etanercept or infliximab within the preceding
month; and 8) pacemaker, implantable defibrillator,
or internalized metal stent.
Stratification and Randomization
Patients were stratified based on the following parameters: 1) primary malignancy (lung vs gastrointestinal vs other); 2) severity of weight loss within the
preceding 2 months (<10 pounds vs 10 pounds); 3)
planned chemotherapy (yes vs no); 4) patient age
(<50 years vs 50 years); 5) male versus female; 6)
treating oncologist plans to use megestrol acetate or
other progestational agent (yes vs no); and 7) prognostic index (good vs bad vs unsure).8 Stratification
utilized a minimization algorithm that balanced the
marginal distributions.
Subsequently, in a double blind manner, patients
were randomly assigned to 1 of the following treatment arms: 1) etanercept at a dose of 25 mg subcutaneously twice weekly for a possible a total of 24
weeks or 2) identical placebo administered subcutaneously twice weekly for a possible total of 24 weeks.

This dose of etanercept was chosen because of its
proven efficacy in other disease settings such as
rheumatoid arthritis.7 All patients were instructed on
the administration of a subcutaneous therapy and
were evaluated by nursing staff at each site before
being allowed to self-administer subcutaneous injections. Patients were encouraged to begin treatment/
placebo as soon as possible but were required to
start within 2 weeks of registration.
It was strongly suggested that megestrol acetate
or other progestational agents not be prescribed during the first month of study enrollment unless this
intention had been declared at the time of study
enrollment. In the event that they had been prescribed during the first month, this information was
to be included in the study record. Other interventions, such as nutritional counseling, were to be
recommended as per the discretion of the treating
oncologist.

weeks. These stopping points were implemented in
part because of the lack of drug availability beyond
24 weeks and in part because of prior studies from
our group that demonstrated very high patient dropout rates early during the treatment period.12,13

Blood Draw for Genotyping
Prior to receiving any study agent, patients were to
have a baseline blood draw for the genotyping of
selected functional TNF-a polymorphisms. Buffy
coats were prepared and sent on ice directly to the
Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. Once received,
they were directly frozen in 2708C until the time of
DNA isolation and genotyping. Concomitant assessment of serum concentrations of TNF-a was not performed because previous studies from our group and
others showed this cytokine to be undetectable in
serum.9

Laboratory Methods
Genomic DNA was extracted from buffy coat preparations using the EASY DNA Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
Calif.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
TNF-a-238 A/G and TNF-a-308 G/A alleles were
detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
restriction fragment length polymorphism assays.
The primers were as follows: F238 (50 -AAACAGACCACAGACCTGGTC-30 ) and R238 (50 CTCACACTCCCCATCCTCCCGGATC-30 ); F308 (50 AGGCAATAGGTTTTGAGGGCCAT3 0 ) and R308 (50 -TCCTCCCTGCTCCGATTCCG30 ).
One hundred nanograms of genomic DNA were
amplified in a total volume of 50 lL containing
0.2 lM of each primer, 0.5 units of platinum Taq
DNA polymerase (Invitrogen), 200 lM of each dNTP,
and PCR reaction buffer (Invitrogen) for 1 cycle at
948C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 948C for
1 minute, 608C for 1 minute, and 728C for 1 minute
plus 728C for 5 minutes and then 48C. The PCR products were digested at 378C with BamH1 and with
NcoI (all from New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Mass.),
followed by 4% agarose gel electrophoresis to detect
TNF-a-238 A/G and TNF-a-308 G/A alleles, respectively. Each PCR run included a ‘‘blank’’ to which no
DNA had been added to ensure that there had been
no sample contamination.

Follow-up
A history and physical examination that included
weighing the patient in the oncologist’s office was
performed at baseline and then on a monthly basis.
Assessment of adverse events occurred during these
visits as well. The National Cancer Institute Common
Toxicity Criteria (CTC; version 2) were used for this
purpose, and patient-reported adverse events were
assessed using a patient-completed questionnaire.
Patients were to complete the NCCTG Anorexia/
Weight Loss questionnaire at baseline, weekly for 4
weeks, and then monthly for as long as they were
receiving the agent/placebo. Other questionnaires
were completed at the same frequency, and these
consisted of the Uniscale global quality of life scale
and the Functional Assessment Anorexia/Cachexia
(FAACT) questionnaire (version 4).10,11
Patients were to continue to administer injections twice weekly as long as the treatment was well
tolerated and both the patient and treating oncologist thought it beneficial for up to a total of 24

Statistical Analyses
The primary objective of the current study was to
compare nonfluid weight gain between the 2 study
arms. Patients who gained 10% of their baseline
weight at any point in the study were deemed a success, and a Fisher exact test was used to compare
the percentage of successful patients between
groups. This 10% increase in weight from baseline
was chosen because other successful agents, such as
megestrol acetate, have been proven to achieve this
degree of weight gain.12,13 The sample size reported
herein provided 81% power to detect a 24% difference in the percentage of patients who gained 10%
of their baseline weight at any point while on the
study with a 2-tailed alternative and a 5% Type I
error rate. Similar analyses were also undertaken for
lesser degrees of weight gain in an exploratory manner. Patients who manifested edema at any time
point after study entry were censored for weight
assessment from that point onward. Changes in
appetite were assessed in the same manner based on

Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for
each patient group, and comparisons were made
with the log-rank test. Correlations between changes
in weight and genotype were explored. A Cox proportional hazards model was constructed to explore the
prognostic effect of variables, including genotype.

RESULTS
Baseline and Descriptive Data
A total of 66 patients were recruited between 2003
and 2005. The study was terminated early because of
poor accrual, and less than half the intended accrual
goal was reached. Three patients withdrew from the
study before receiving any study drug, and thus a
total of 63 evaluable patients are the focus of this
report.
The patients treated with etanercept (33 patients)
and the placebo-exposed patients (30 patients) were
comparable at baseline (Table 1). The median age in
the former group was 64 years (range, 42–84 years)
and was 68 years (range, 29–89 years) in the latter
group. Men comprised 52% of the etanercept group
and 47% of the placebo group. Otherwise, the groups
were similar based on anticipated use of appetite stimulants, anticipated use of chemotherapy, site of primary cancer, and degree of weight loss at baseline.

ter than the other in terms of weight gain.

Follow-up
Reasons for withdrawing from therapy in the etanercept and placebo arms were as follows: patient
declined further therapy and/or developed adverse
events in 32% and 40%, respectively; patient developed disease progression or developed other medical
problems in 12% and 17%, respectively; and patient
died on study in 13% and 23%, respectively. The
remaining patients in the cohorts withdrew from
treatment for a variety of other reasons that are less
easily categorized.
Of note, the initiation of other potential appetite
stimulants was well balanced between the study
arms. Four of the etanercept-treated patients and 3
patients who were given placebo were prescribed a
progestational agent during the first month of therapy. In addition, 7 patients treated with etanercept
and 11 placebo-exposed patients were prescribed
corticosteroids.
Weight
No patient in either treatment arm achieved the primary endpoint of gaining 10% of their baseline
weight. If weight gain was categorized by increments
of a smaller percentage, 27% of the etanercept-treated patients and 3% of the placebo-exposed patients
gained 0–4% of their baseline weight, and 17% and
9%, respectively, gained 5% to 9% of their baseline
weight. Nonetheless, there was no statistically significant difference in weight gain noted in 1 group compared with the other (Fig. 1).
In an exploratory manner, we also reported
weight analyses at Weeks 4 and 8. At 4 weeks, the
median change in weight from baseline in the
patients treated with etanercept (26 patients) was
0.3 kg (range, 26.3–6.4 kg), and in the patients who

received placebo (25 patients), this figure was
21.4 kg (range, 213.1–6.4 kg) (P 5 .13). At 8 weeks,
the median change in weight from baseline in the
etanercept-treated group (17 patients) was 0.4 kg
(range, 28.0–4.3 kg), and was 20.4 kg in the placeboexposed group (15 patients) (range, 28.0–6.1 kg)
(P 5 .35). Although dropout rates were high for the
reasons discussed earlier, such rates appear roughly
equivalent at the 4-week and 8-week timepoints.
Again, these exploratory analyses suggest no statistically significant improvement in weight with the
administration of etanercept.

Anorexia and Quality of Life
The NCCTG Anorexia/Weight Loss Questionnaire and
the FAACT questionnaire found no significant differences in appetite over time in the 2 treatment groups
(Table 2). For example, evaluating baseline and 1month responses to the question ‘‘What effect, if any,
do you feel the study medications have had on your
food intake?’’ demonstrated that 6 patients treated
with etanercept described their appetite as ‘‘the
same,’’ and 10 placebo-exposed patients provided a
similar response. Four etanercept-treated patients
described their appetite as ‘‘reduced’’ at 1 month in
contrast to none of the placebo-exposed patients. The

only item found to demonstrate a slight trend in
improvement centered around nausea and vomiting,
and this questionnaire response ironically favored placebo as the palliative agent; 68% of the patients treated with etanercept described no vomiting at 1 month,
in contrast to 94% of patients given a placebo
(P 5 .052). Of parenthetical note, the global quality of
life scale demonstrated no clinically or statistically significant differences between groups over time except
for a suggestion that the etanercept-treated patients
reported a stronger sense of mental well-being at 1
month. However, in the context of the other negative
observations, this finding was viewed as spurious.

Survival
Overall survival was not found to be statistically significantly different between the 2 groups. The median survival among etanercept-treated patients was
175 days and was 148 days in patients who were
given a placebo (P 5 .82) (Fig. 2).
TNF Polymorphisms
Genetic polymorphisms of the TNF-a gene at positions 2238 and 2308 were assessed in 54 patients.
The lack of feasibility in shipping a blood sample
accounted for the absence of a sample in the other

[P 5 .01]) (Fig. 3). However, the small number of
patients in this analysis invites caution when interpreting this observation.

FIGURE 2. The median survivals of those patients treated with etanercept
(solid line) and placebo-exposed patients (dotted line) were 175 days and
148 days, respectively (P 5 .82).

Adverse Events
Maximum adverse events were for the most part not
significantly different between the 2 groups with the
exception of anemia, which was milder among patients
treated with etanercept, and thrombocytopenia, which
was also found to be milder among etanercept-treated
patients (Table 3). Another notable finding is that neuromotor adverse events appeared to be slightly more
pronounced among patients who received etanercept.
Etanercept was not associated with higher infection
rates. Patient-reported adverse events, as ascertained
by questionnaire completion, did not contribute other
information beyond that reported in Table 3 and
demonstrated no statistically significant differences
between the study arms (data not shown.)

DISCUSSION

FIGURE 3. The tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a)-238 G/A genotype
appeared to be predictive of a shorter survival (solid line) compared with
patients with the TNF-a – G/G genotype (dotted line): 85 days versus 203
days, respectively (P 5 .01). However, the small number of patients in this
analysis invites caution when interpreting this observation.

patients. The TNF-a-238 G/A and G/G genotypes
were observed in 4 patients and 50 patients, respectively. The TNF-a-308 G/G, A/A, and G/A genotypes
were observed in 35 patients, 2 patients, and 17
patients, respectively.
Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was tested for the
observed frequencies of the TNF genotypes described
earlier, and none of the marker frequencies achieved
a statistically significant difference from what would
be expected based on the allelic frequencies
observed in our sample.
Clinical correlative studies demonstrated no
association between any of these genotypes and
patient-reported weight loss at baseline. Moreover,
over time, none of these genotypes was found to be
predictive of weight loss or weight gain. It is interesting to note that the TNF-a-238 G/A genotype
appeared to predict a shorter survival compared with
the G/G genotype (85 days vs 203 days, respectively

To our knowledge, the current study represents 1 of
the first clinical trials to test an inhibitor of TNF to
treat the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome in
patients with solid tumor malignancies. This study
found that the endpoints of weight, appetite, and
survival were not improved with the administration
of etanercept, a TNF-a inhibitor. Although the current study was relatively limited in its sample size, it
nonetheless suggests that further study of this syndrome with this agent administered at this dose is
unlikely to yield positive findings.
Do the results of this study indicate that TNF-a
is not a mediator of the cancer anorexia/weight loss
syndrome? Despite the negative clinical findings
reported herein, it is still plausible that this cytokine
is a mediator of this syndrome. First, an extensive literature, as reviewed earlier, points to the role of
TNF-a in mediating weight loss and appetite in the
setting of cancer. It would be unwise to invoke the
results of only 1 clinical trial to negate the compelling findings from a large body of preclinical literature. One possible explanation for the negative
findings of the current trial may hinge on the fact
that multiple other cytokines work in concert to
mediate this syndrome.14 Disruption of 1 component
of this interplay may not be sufficient for a net positive clinical effect. Second, along these same lines,
the dose of etanercept tested in the current trial
deserves some comment. In the setting of the cancer
anorexia/weight loss syndrome, it is plausible that a
much higher degree of TNF-a inhibition must be
instituted to lead to clinical manifestations of efficacy. The fact that we observed that 27% of etaner-

Some patients dropped out prior to an assessment of adverse events, thus explaining the diminishing sample size.

cept-treated and 3% of placebo-exposed patients
gained 0% to 4% of their baseline weight might suggest that with a much larger dose and sample size,
this study might have detected a statistically significant improvement in weight with this agent. For
now, our only conclusion is that the dose of etanercept prescribed in this trial does not appear to yield
a clinically notable palliative effect in patients with
the cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome.
Third, it is important to point out that this study
closed early because of poor accrual. Perhaps the use
of a subcutaneous injection that required self-administration or the inclusion of a placebo arm contributed to this poor accrual. Despite the speculation
regarding the reasons for poor accrual, we must
acknowledge that a larger sample size might have
allowed for the detection of more subtle differences
between the study arms to demonstrate some preliminary benefits of TNF blockade in palliating the
cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome. Overall,
although this study did not demonstrate major differences in outcomes between the study arms, one
could make an argument in favor of better characterizing the role of TNF blockade in patients with the
cancer anorexia/weight loss syndrome.
It is interesting to note that the current study
provided 2 other observations that are worthy of further investigation. First, etanercept appeared to result
in lower rates of anemia and thrombocytopenia. Several other investigators have described the role of
this cytokine in bone marrow disorders and, recently,
Boula et al. observed that TNF inhibition with a
monoclonal antibody improved the hematopoietic
supporting capacity of bone marrow stromal cells.15
The effects of etanercept on anemia and thrombocytopenia are plausible in the context of similar
reports. Secondly, and along these same lines, this
study observed that the TNF-a-238 G/A genotype is
associated with a relatively poorer outcome. The less
favorable effects of this genotype have been observed
in other clinical settings. Pastor et al. reported that
this genotype is associated with a higher risk of alcoholic cirrhosis,16 and Achrol et al. observed that this
genotype appears to increase the risk of hemorrhage
in patients with arteriovenous malformations of the
brain.17 Thus, although the TNF-a-238 G/A genotype
occurred in only a small number of patients and
although its prognostic effect requires confirmation,
this preliminary observation appears plausible in the
context of earlier studies.
