Cancer cell molecular mimicry of stem cells (SC) imbues neoplastic cells with enhanced
proliferative and renewal capacities. In support, numerous mediators of SC self-renewal have been
evinced to exhibit oncogenic potential. We have recently reported that shRNA-mediated
knockdown of the embryonic stem cell (ESC) self-renewal gene NANOG significantly reduced
the clonogenic and tumorigenic capabilities of various cancer cells. In this study, we sought to test
the potential pro-tumorigenic functions of NANOG, particularly, in prostate cancer (PCa). Using
quantitative RT-PCR, we first confirmed that PCa cells expressed NANOG mRNA primarily from
the NANOGP8 locus on chromosome 15q14. We then constructed a lentiviral promoter reporter in
which the -3.8 kb NANOGP8 genomic fragment was used to drive the expression of green
fluorescence protein (GFP). We observed that NANOGP8-GFP+ PCa cells exhibited cancer stem
cell (CSC) characteristics such as enhanced clonal growth and tumor regenerative capacity. To
further investigate the functions and mechanisms of NANOG in tumorigenesis, we established
tetracycline-inducible NANOG overexpressing cancer cell lines, including both prostate (Du145
and LNCaP) and breast (MCF-7) cancer cells. NANOG induction promoted drug-resistance in
MCF-7 cells, tumor regeneration in Du145 cells, and, most importantly, castration-resistant tumor
development in LNCaP cells. These pro-tumorigenic effects of NANOG were associated with key
molecular changes, including an upregulation of molecules such as CXCR4, IGFBP5, CD133 and
ALDH1. The present gain-of-function studies, coupled with our recent loss-of-function work,

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Immortality is among the fundamental biological properties of malignant cells attributable to
the presence of a distinct subset of stem-like cells within tumors. Self-renewing neoplastic
cells have been hypothesized to underlie the long-term proliferative potential of cancer cells,
often sharing gene expression profiles with embryonic stem cells (ESCs) or primitive
somatic SCs (Ben-Porath et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009; Pece et al., 2010; Wong et al., 2008).
Numerous studies over the past several years have provided solid evidence for the existence
of such cancer sustaining stem-like cells, generally termed ‘cancer stem cells’ (CSCs) or
‘tumor-initiating cells’(Al-Hajj et al., 2003; Boiko et al., 2010; O'Brien et al., 2007;
Patrawala et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2003). However, the molecular framework within which
cancer cells fit into the SC paradigm and how this relates to the development of clinical
manifestations of late stage disease, including resistance to conventional therapeutics, tumor
relapse and metastasis, remains obscure.

Infinitely self-renewing cells (i.e., CSCs) could conceivably account for the immortal nature
of tumor cells at the population level, and accumulating evidence supports the notion that
ESC self-renewal and pluripotency genes, including the transcription factor triad OCT-3/4
(i.e., OCT-4), SOX-2, and, of particular interest, NANOG, serve as neoplastic engines
driving oncogenesis (Gangemi et al., 2009; Hochedlinger et al., 2005; Jeter et al., 2009; Liu
et al., 2009; Piestun et al., 2006; Po et al., 2010; Zbinden et al., 2010). Previously, we
evaluated the causal relationship between the expression of NANOG in human epithelial
cancer cells and tumor development (Jeter et al., 2009). We found that NANOG mRNA in
somatic cancer cells appeared to originate predominantly from NANOGP8, a retrogene
derivative distinct from the NANOG1 locus expressed in ESCs and that NANOGP8 mRNA
was enriched in CD44+ prostate cancer (PCa) stem/progenitor cells and in MCF7 side
population (SP) cells. Further, we showed that NANOG protein was heterogeneously
expressed as a ‘gradient’ in xenograft as well as primary prostate tumor cells. Of particular
importance, we observed that NANOG knockdown decreased the clonogenic growth and
tumorigenicity of breast (MCF-7), colon (Colo320) and several prostate (PC3, Du145 and
LAPC-9) cancer cell lines and xenografts (Jeter et al., 2009). These results raise an
important question of whether NANOG expression actively promotes neoplasia and/or
tumor progression. Here, we address this question by further investigating the origins of
NANOG in cancer cells, particularly, in PCa, and exploring its oncogenic potential and
associated mechanisms.

Results
NANOGP8 mRNA expression in PCa, including primary patient tumors (HPCa)

Author Manuscript

Our first aim in the present study was to determine whether cancer cells expressing
endogenous NANOG are intrinsically unique compared to their non-expressing (or lowexpressing) counterparts. To this end, we conceived a promoter reporter strategy to track and
isolate cells differentially expressing NANOG. However, one complication is that at least
two highly similar NANOG mRNA species have been reported originating from two distinct
loci (Figure 1a), including the NANOG1, located on chromosome 12p13, in ESCs, and its
retrogene NANOGP8, located on chromosome 15q14 (Booth and Holland, 2004). Given
their remarkable similarity (highly conserved over the entire length of the processed
transcripts with only 6 nucleotide substitutions in the coding regions and 99% identical at
the amino acid level) (Jeter et al., 2009), theoretically, NANOG1 and/or NANOGP8 could
account for the presence of NANOG mRNA in cancer cells. We previously provided
preliminary evidence that NANOGP8 was the predominant source of NANOG mRNA in
epithelial cancer cells, including PCa (Jeter et al., 2009); however, due to methodological
limitations we could not eliminate NANOG1 as an important contributor. Thus, we set out to
further investigate the origin of NANOG mRNA using quantitative reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis.

We designed NANOG1 and NANOGP8 specific qRT-PCR primers and probes
(Supplemental Table S1) by targeting a unique 22-base pair (bp) region in the NANOG1 3′untranslated region (3′-UTR; Figure 1a). NANOGP8 mRNA was readily detectable in a
range of cancer cell lines including those derived from breast (MCF7), colon (Colo320) and
prostate (LNCaP, Du145 and PC3) cancers, as well as in LAPC4 and LAPC9 PCa
xenografts (Figure 1b). As might be expected, LNCaP, the most benign PCa line, expressed
the least NANOGP8 mRNA (Figure 1b). In contrast, NANOG1 qRT-PCR in the same panel
of cancer cells (using identical template used in NANOGP8 amplifications) was generally
below the detection limit (i.e., cycle-threshold >38) although these same primers robustly
amplified product from N-TERA teratocarcinoma cells (cycle-threshold of 21) (data not
shown). Importantly, a cohort of 7 primary PCa patient samples (HPCa) and two early
xenografts (i.e., HPCa58P1 and HPCa101P0) also expressed readily detectable NANOGP8
mRNA (Figure 1c) whereas NANOG1 was undetectable (i.e., cycle threshold >38) in all
samples (not shown). Consistent with earlier findings (Jeter et al., 2009), primary PCa
specimens expressed higher relative levels of NANOGP8 mRNA than cultured PCa cells
(compare Figure 1c and Figure 1b). Interestingly, the two HPCa samples (i.e., HPCa58 and
HPCa101) that successfully gave rise to xenografts upon transplantation in NOD/SCID mice
expressed higher levels of NANOGP8 mRNA than the other five HPCa samples (Figure 1c).
Upon in vivo passaging, the HPCa58P1 showed reduced whereas the HPCa101P0 showed
increased NANOGP8 mRNA levels (Figure 1c), suggesting that passaging of HPCa tumors
in mice may alter the expression levels of NANOGP8 mRNA.

The above qRT-PCR analyses are consistent with our previous semi-quantitative RT-PCR
data (Jeter et al., 2009) and confirm that NANOGP8 mRNA is the predominant NANOG
mRNA species in PCa (and some other cancer) cells. Consequently, we replaced the
constitutive and ubiquitous phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) promoter in the RRL-PGK-GFP
lentiviral vector (Zufferey et al., 1998) with the ∼3.8 kb region (nucleotides – 3 764 to + 58)
upstream of the NANOGP8 Transcription Start Site (TSS) to construct the RRL-NP8-GFP
vector (Figure 2a). FACS analysis of PGK-GFP transduced PCa cells revealed that in
LNCaP and Du145 cells, 80-90% cells were GFP+ at 2-μl virus and only slightly more cells
became GFP+ at 20-μl virus (Figure 2b; Supplemental Figure S1a). PC3 cells infected with
the PGK-GFP vector, on the other hand, showed a viral titer-dependent increase in GFP+
cells (Figure 2b). In comparison, only a very small percentage of PCa cells were GFP+ upon
transduction with 2-μl of NP8-GFP lentivirus, prepared in parallel (Figure 2b; Supplemental
Figure S1a). Even at 20-μl virus, only ∼19% LNCaP cells and ∼34% Du145 cells were
NP8-GFP+ (Figure 2b). For PC3 cells, even at 100-μl virus, <10% cells infected with the
NP8-GFP were GFP+ (Figure 2b). These results suggest that as we previously reported
(Jeter et al., 2009), NANOG-expressing PCa cells are generally rare and NANOGP8 mRNA
levels in cultured PCa cells are low, consistent with the preceding qRT-PCR analysis
(Figure 1b). Of note, Du145 cells expressed NP8-GFP as a clear gradient with increasing
volumes of virus, reaching ∼80% GFP+ cells at 100-μl virus (Figure 2b). These observations
parallel our previous reports of NANOG protein expression as a gradient and NANOG
protein being more readily detectable in Du145 cells relative to PC3 or LNCaP cells (Jeter et
al., 2009). Immunofluorescence (IF) staining of LNCaP cells transduced with NP8-GFP
revealed concordant expression of NANOG and GFP in these cells (Figure 2c). Using the
denaturation immunostaining protocol (Jeter et al., 2009), we observed ∼10-fold enrichment
of NANOG-positive cells in purified NP8-GFP+ LNCaP cells compared to bulk LNCaP
cells (not shown). Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed NANOG mRNA levels in NP8GFP+ versus NP8-GFP- PC3 cells to be 2.02% versus 0.11% relative to the levels in NTERA human embryonal carcinoma cells, indicating a 18-fold enrichment of NANOG
mRNA in NP8-GFP+ PC3 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that PCa cells
expressing the promoter constructs are enriched in NANOG mRNA and protein expression.

Next, we set out to test the biological characteristics of RRL transduced and sorted Du145,
PC3 and LNCaP cells. Du145 NP8-GFP+ cells, compared to NP8-GFP− cells, generated
more holoclones, meroclones and paraclones (Figure 2d), morphologically distinct classes
generally thought to reflect the differentiation state of the originating cell with the
holoclones containing the long-term self-renewing CSCs (Li et al., 2008). In contrast,
purified PGK-GFP+ and PGK-GFP- Du145 cells exhibited similar cloning efficiency (C.E)
(Supplemental Figure S1b). PC3 NP8-GFP+ cells also exhibited enhanced C.E. (Figure 2e)
and further, gave rise to larger clones compared to NP8-GFP− PC3 cells (3 949 ± 1 462
versus 2 278 ± 912, respectively; P = 0.04). Interestingly, NP8-GFP+ and NP8-GFP−
LNCaP cells exhibited similar C.E. in standard serum-containing media. However, in
androgen-deprived conditions, i.e., in media containing charcoal dextran-stripped serum
(CDSS) and/or antiandrogen bicalutamide, purified NP8-GFP+ LNCaP cells exhibited

significantly higher C.E. than the NP8-GFP− cells (Figure 2f; Supplemental Figure S2a).
These latter observations in LNCaP cells provided the first evidence that NANOG might be
associated with resistance to androgen deprivation.

Author Manuscript

Finally, we assayed the quintessential biological property of tumor cells, i.e., tumor
development. NP8-GFP transduced Du145 cells, initially 30% GFP+, were sorted into 7aminoactinomycin D (7AAD) negative (i.e., viable) NP8-GFP− and NP8-GFP+ subsets and
injected subcutaneously (s.c) into NOD/SCID mice. The primary (1°) Du145-NP8-GFP+
tumors were not only larger than those derived from Du145-NP8-GFP− cells (Figure 2g) but
also comprised a mixture of GFP+ (41%) and GFP− cells (not shown), thus recapitulating
the heterogeneity of the starting population and suggesting that the NP8-GFP+ cells could
divide asymmetrically to give rise to NP8-GFP− cells. NP8-GFP+ Du145 cells purified from
the 1° tumors also regenerated tumors ∼60% larger than NP8-GFP− cell derived tumors (not
shown). Histological analysis revealed more readily detectable NANOG-expressing and
Ki-67+ cells in tumors derived from NP8-GFP+ Du145 cells (Supplemental Figure S2b).
Similar to NP8-GFP+ Du145 cells, the NP8-GFP+ PC3 cells also generated larger tumors
than their NP8-GFP− counterparts in both 1° and 2° tumor assays (Figure 2h). Collectively,
the promoter-tracking studies demonstrate that the NANOGP8-expressing PCa cells possess
higher clonal and tumor-regenerating capacities, characteristics associated with and
expected of CSCs.
Establishing an inducible NANOG-overexpressing lentiviral system

The second principal aim of this study was to determine the cellular and molecular
mechanisms underpinning the biological functions of NANOG in cancer cells. Since
NANOG is normally expressed at low levels in cultured epithelial cancer cells relative to
ESCs (Jeter et al., 2009), we engineered a tetracycline (doxycycline, dox) inducible
lentiviral system to overexpress NANOG (Figure 3a). Cancer cells (MCF7, Du145 and
LNCaP) initially infected with the pLVX-TetON lentivirus (Figure 3a) and expressing high
levels of the dox-inducible transactivator (TetR/VP16) were clonally derived via analysis of
expression of a Tetracycline Responsive Element (TRE) luciferase reporter (data not
shown). Stable clones were then subjected to 2° transductions with either pLVX empty
vector or the pLVX-TRE-Nanog1/NanogP8 lentiviral vectors in which the NANOG1 or
NANOGP8 cDNA was cloned downstream of the TRE (Figure 3a). Western blot analysis
revealed dox-induced upregulation of NANOG protein in a dose-dependent fashion (Figure
3b-c; note that most commercial anti-NANOG Abs were generated against NANOG1 and
recognize both NANOG1 and NANOGP8 on Western and IF; Jeter et al., 2009). The
induced NANOG protein (for the sake of simplicity, both NANOG1 and NANOGP8
proteins will frequently be termed NANOG henceforward due to nearly identical amino acid
sequences) was mostly detected in the nucleus (Figure 3d-e, Supplemental Figure S3), a
subcellular localization expected for a transcription factor. In the absence of dox, NANOGexpressing Du145 (Figure 3d) and MCF7 (Supplemental Figure S3) cells were rare and
NANOG-expressing LNCaP cells were even more rare (Figure 3e), consistent with our
earlier results (Figure 1b; Figure 2b; Jeter et al., 2009) and our observations that the
endogenous NANOG protein was only detectable by Western upon longer exposure (Figure
3b-c and data not shown).

To evaluate whether the overexpressed NANOG protein is functional, we performed
NANOG chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays followed by PCR using primers
against several reported gene targets of NANOG1 in hESCs including c-Myc, Oct-4, Ecadherin (E-cad), FGF4, Gli1, and HoxC13 (Medeiros et al., 2009; Supplemental Figure
S4). We first performed ChIP assays in N-TERA cells and the results revealed differential
NANOG protein binding to the individual gene promoters (Figure 4a). ChIP assays in
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 overexpressing (i.e., pLVX-Nanog1/NanogP8) LNCaP cells
revealed that dox-induced NANOG also bound to the promoter regions of these genes
(Figure 4b) although the levels of binding, after normalizing to RbIgG ChIP, was expectedly
lower than in N-TERA cells (compare Figure 4b-c vs. Figure 4a). Similar ChIP assays did
not reveal significant binding of either NANOG1 or NANOGP8 at the GAPDH promoter
(Figure 4c). Altogether, he IF and ChIP assays indicate that the overexpressed NANOG1/
NANOGP8 proteins in our inducible systems localize to the nucleus and are functional in
binding the expected targets.
Short-term NANOG induction does not promote cancer cell proliferation

Having successfully established an inducible system to overexpress functional NANOG, we
next sought to determine the biological responses to elevated NANOG protein in cancer
cells. As NANOG overexpression had been previously reported to enhance proliferation in
several cell types, including NIH3T3 cells (Zhang et al., 2005), ESCs (Ma et al., 2009) and
colorectal cancer cells (Meng et al., 2010), we first performed short-term assays in which
our inducible-NANOG cell lines were stimulated with doxycycline for 3-4 d prior to
counting the total cell number. To our surprise, under standard culture conditions, no
significant difference was apparent in pLVX-control versus pLVX-Nanog1/P8 LNCaP,
Du145 or MCF-7 cells (Supplemental Figure S5a; data not shown). BrdU
(bromodeoxyuridine) incorporation assays also did not reveal any differences (Supplemental
Figure S5b), suggesting that increased NANOG expression short-term did not promote cell
proliferation in these cancer cells. Consistent with this observed lack of phenotype, Western
blot analysis of short-term (∼3-4 d) doxycycline-treated Du145, LNCaP and MCF-7 cells
revealed that despite a clear induction of NANOG protein, there was no detectable change in
the levels of several positive regulators of the cell cycle, including CDC25A and CDK6,
previously reportedly to be transcriptionally upregulated in response to NANOG
overexpression in human ESCs cells (Zhang et al., 2009), as well as cyclin D1 and the cMyc oncogene (Supplemental Figure S5c-d). Similar to these cell-cycle regulators, several
SC molecules including Sox2, Oct4, Gli1, Nkx3.1, and CD44, as well as two molecules
associated with EMT (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), i.e., Snail and E-cad, also did not
show significant changes upon short-term NANOG1/NANOGP8 induction (Supplemental
Figure S5c-d).
NANOG overexpression promotes castration-resistant (androgen-independent)
phenotypes and tumor regeneration in LNCaP cells
Although short-term induction of NANOG did not promote cancer cell proliferation, it
promoted anchorage-independent survival and sphere formation in LNCaP cells in
androgen-deficient conditions, generally assayed longer term (2-4 weeks). Two independent
experiments revealed that pLVX-NanogP8 but not pLVX-Nanog1 LNCaP cells generated

∼2× more spheres in methylcellulose than pLVX-control cells (Figure 5a). On the other
hand, both pLVX-Nanog1 and pLVX-NanogP8 LNCaP cells cultured in CDSS, compared to
pLVX control cells, formed more androgen-independent (AI) foci and floating spheroids
(Figure 5b-c), and resulted in higher cell numbers (Figure 5d).

Author Manuscript

Next, we determined the impact of NANOG overexpression on LNCaP tumor development
in either intact (i.e., androgen-proficient) or castrated (i.e., surgical castration plus
bicalutamide treatment; see Methods) NOD/SCID-γ mice. We observed that NANOG
overexpression promoted LNCaP tumor regeneration in intact hosts, but in a somewhat
inconsistent manner. For example, pLVX-Nanog1 cells developed larger tumors than pLVX
cells in one (Figure 5e) but not the other (Figure 5f) experiment. pLVX-NanogP8 cells, on
the other hand, regenerated larger tumors than pLVX cells but in both experiments the
difference were just below statistical significance (Figure 5e-f). In contrast, both pLVXNanogP8 and pLVX-Nanog1 cells developed significantly larger tumors than the control
cells in castrated NOD/SCID-γ mice (Figure 5f-g). Of note, qRT-PCR and IHC analysis
revealed overall similar levels of NANOG mRNA and protein expression in the pLVXNANOG1 and pLVX-NANOGP8 LNCaP tumors developed in intact (Supplemental Figure
S6a, left; Supplemental Figure S6b) or castrated (not shown) hosts. Interestingly, when we
derived tumor cells from the LNCaP AI tumors and analyzed their migratory capacities by
time-lapse video microscopy, we observed that NANOGP8 expressing AI cells possessed a
higher migration rate such that they closed the induced ‘wounds’ faster than the pLVX
control or pLVX-Nanog1 cells (Figure 5h).
Molecular changes that accompany NANOG overexpression in LNCaP cells

Given that NANOG-overexpressing LNCaP cells both in vitro and in vivo exhibited
enhanced hormone refractory growth, we wondered what molecular mechanisms could
account for this resistance to androgen-deprivation? IHC analysis of AI tumors developed in
castrated hosts (Figure 5g) revealed significantly more Ki-67+ cells in both pLVX-Nanog8
and pLVX-Nanog1 tumors (Figure 6a), suggesting that NANOG overexpression promotes
cell proliferation in vivo. Consistent with this conclusion, the pLVX-Nanog1 AI tumors,
and, in particular, the pLVX-NanogP8 AI tumors, showed higher levels of c-Myc compared
to the control tumors (Figure 6b). In contrast, we did not observe obvious differences in
Ki-67+ cells in the LNCaP tumors developed in intact male mice (Supplemental Figure S6c).
Previously, we provided preliminary evidence that NANOG and androgen receptor (AR)
seemed to be reciprocally expressed in HPCa cells in patient tumors (Jeter et al., 2009). IHC
(Figure 6a) and Western blotting analysis (Figure 6c) detected reduced AR levels in pLVXNanog1/NanogP8 LNCaP AI tumors. In fact, even in short-term in vitro assays, both clone
B2 (Figure 6d) and clone D2 (Supplemental Figure S5c) LNCaP cells, upon NANOG1/
NANOGP8 induction, demonstrated subtle but reproducible decreases in AR. Consistent
with reduced AR levels, the pLVX-Nanog1/NanogP8 LNCaP AI tumors also showed
reduced levels of PSA (Figure 6a). Pilot experiments with a PSA promoter-driven GFP
reporter also revealed that the pLVX-Nanog1/NanogP8 LNCaP cell cultures had ∼20% and
18%, respectively, less GFP+ cells than pLVX control LNCaP cells (data not shown). In
principle, increased cell proliferation (i.e., increased Ki-67+ cells associated with c-Myc

upregulation) and inhibition of differentiation (i.e., reduced AR and PSA) could help explain
NANOG1/NANOGP8-promoted LNCaP AI tumor regeneration.

Author Manuscript

To further explore the potential molecular mechanisms of NANOG-promoted castrationresistant properties in LNCaP cells, we analyzed, by qRT-PCR, the mRNA levels of a panel
of molecules (Supplemental Table S1 and S3), which encompasses reported NANOG targets
in ESCs (OCT-4 and SOX-2), CSC markers (CD133, CD44, c-KIT/CD117, ALDH1 and
ABCG-2/BCRP), and molecules previously implicated in PCa castration resistance
(IGFBP5, CXCR4 and Bcl-2). As shown in Figure 6e, insulin growth factor binding-protein
5 (IGFBP-5) and chemokine receptor CXCR4 mRNAs were significantly upregulated in
response to NANOG overexpression in androgen-deprived conditions. The relative CXCR4
mRNA levels were elevated ∼12× and ∼10× and IGFBP5 was elevated ∼5× and ∼7×,
respectively, in bicalutamide-treated pLVX-Nanog1 and pLVX-NanogP8 LNCaP cells
relative to pLVX control cells (Figure 6e; Supplemental Table S3). Three CSC surface
markers, i.e., CD133, ABCG2, and c-KIT, generally increased in response to NANOG
overexpression, particularly, in spheres (Figure 6e). Several other molecules examined also
showed some alterations in androgen-deficient conditions (Figure 6e), although these
differences were generally less than two-fold.

Author Manuscript

Somewhat surprisingly, when we examined the same panel of genes in LNCaP cells cultured
in regular serum-containing media and treated with doxycycline for 3-14 days, many of the
same genes were also dynamically upregulated in response to NANOG1/NANOGP8
induction, which included both IGFBP5 and CXCR4 as well as CD133, ABCG2, and c-KIT
(Figure 6f). These results suggest that the alterations of these genes are also likely involved
in mediating the general pro-tumorigenic effects in addition to the AI-specific effects of
NANOG.
Further evidence that Nanog overexpression promotes CSC phenotypes and CSC
properties

Author Manuscript

To further evaluate the cellular and molecular consequences of NANOG overexpression in
other contexts, we continued the in vitro and in vivo studies using our inducible Du145 and
MCF7 cells. NANOGP8 induction in Du145 cells, which are AI PCa cells and lack AR
expression, promoted tumor regeneration in both ectopic (i.e., s.c; Figure 7a) or orthotopic
(i.e., dorsal prostate or DP; Figure 7b) sites. Curiously, pLVX-Nanog1 Du145 cells did not
regenerate significantly larger tumors than pLVX control cells (Figure 7a-b) despite overall
similar expression levels of NANOG mRNA (Supplemental Figure S6a, right) and protein
(not shown) in pLVX-Nanog1 and pLVX-NanogP8 Du145 tumors. pLVX-NanogP8 Du145
cell-derived orthotopic tumors had higher levels of c-Myc protein in comparison to either
pLVX-Nanog1 or pLVX-control cells (Figure 7c), perhaps partially accounting for the
protumorigenic activity of NANOGP8.
MCF-7 cells overexpressing NANOG, particularly NANOGP8, exhibited increased
resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs doxorubicine and paclitaxel, consistent with
previous findings by others (Bourguignon et al., 2008). To explore the potential mechanisms
underlying the NANOG-conferred drug tolerance in MCF7 cells, we also employed qRTPCR quantification of more than a dozen genes (Figure 7e). The results revealed dynamic

upregulation by NANOG1/NANOGP8 of several prosurvival/detoxification genes including
Bcl-2, ABCG2, CD133, and ALDH1A1 (Figure 7e; Supplemental Table S3). IF staining
confirmed increased CD133 protein in NANOG-overexpressing MCF7 cells (Figure 7f).
ALDH1A1 (aldehyde dehydrogenase 1, isoform A1) is the primary ALDH isoform
mediating the ALDEFLUOR phenotype (Ginestier et al., 2007). Consistent with the
upregulation of the ALDH1A1 mRNA, NANOG1/NANOGP8 overexpression greatly
increased the percentage of ALDEFLUOR-positive MCF7 cells (Figure 7g). Significantly,
both NANOG1 and NANOGP8 also increased the abundance of ALDEFLUOR+ Du145
cells (Supplemental Figure S6d).
In addition to the above 4 molecules, NANOG1/NANOGP8 overexpression in MCF7 cells
also upregulated, to lower levels, many of the other molecules examined including c-Myc,
OCT-4, SOX2, CD44, c-KIT, MMP9, TWIST, and SNAIL (Figure 7e).

Discussion
NANOGP8-expressing PCa cells possess CSC properties

Author Manuscript

In the present study, we first utilize differential qRT-PCR analysis to show that cultured PCa
(and some other cancer) cells, and xenograft as well as patient tumors all predominantly
express NANOGP8 mRNA with NANOG1 mRNA generally below the detection threshold.
These results corroborate our earlier preliminary report (Jeter et al., 2009) and are consistent
with NANOG1 being restricted to pluripotent cells and downregulated during differentiation
(Chambers et al., 2003; Chambers and Tomlinson, 2009). NANOG1 gene in PCa cells such
as PC3 seems to be epigenetically silenced as treatment with TSA, a histone deacetylase
inhibitor, but not 5′-aza-deoxycytidine, a DNA methytransferase inhibitor, partially
‘restores’ NANOG1 expression (Jeter et al, 2009). It is intriguing that somatic cancer cells,
rather than reactivating the endogenous NANOG1 locus, express NANOG from the
NANOGP8 locus. We are currently investigating how the NANOGP8 retrogene is
transcriptionally activated in cancer cells.

Knocking down endogenous NANOG in cancer cells significantly diminishes their
tumorigenic capacity (Jeter et al., 2009). Since tumor initiation is one of the defining
characteristics of CSCs, our loss-of-function results (Jeter et al., 2009) suggest that
NANOGP8-expressing cancer cells might possess CSC properties, This premise is born out
in the present promoter-tracking studies: NANOGP8-expressing PCa cells are intrinsically
unique in comparison to isogenic non-expressing cells, exhibiting enhanced clonogenicity in
vitro and tumorigenicity in vivo. Notably, NANOGP8-GFP PCa cells can regenerate tumors
that contain GFP- cells as the majority, suggesting that NANOGP8+ PCa cells can selfrenew in vivo.
NANOG overexpression promotes CSC phenotypes and properties in vitro and in vivo
Our current NANOG gain-of-function studies further complement the earlier knockdown
findings (Jeter et al., 2009) and indicate that NANOG overexpression is sufficient to confer
cancer cells certain CSC properties and phenotypes. Thus, NANOG induction promotes
clonogenic survival in LNCaP cells, drug resistance in MCF7 cells, and, most importantly,

tumor development in LNCaP and Du145 cells. Accompanying the manifestation of such
biological properties of CSCs, NANOG overexpression enhances the expression of many
CSC–associated molecules, including, among others, CD133, ABCG2, ALDH1A1, and
CD44.

Author Manuscript

NANOG overexpression increases CD133 expression in both LNCaP and MCF7 cells.
NANOG expression has been reported to be enriched in CD133+ cells in a variety of tumors,
including those in the brain (Heddleston et al., 2009; Po et al., 2010; Zbinden et al., 2010),
oral mucosa (Chiou et al., 2008) and liver (Machida et al., 2009). Of particular relevancy,
CD133 has been proposed to enrich for human prostatic CSCs (Collins et al., 2005) and we
have detected elevated levels of NANOG mRNA in CD133+ human PCa cells (Jeter et al.,
2009). We have also observed that CD133+ LAPC4 PCa cells possess higher sphere-forming
and tumor-initiating capacities than CD133- LAPC4 cells (Patrawala and Tang, unpublished
observations). Curiously, CD133 also appears to be preferentially expressed in transient,
reversible drug tolerant subsets of PC9 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells that represent
only ∼2% of the parental population (Sharma et al., 2010).

Author Manuscript

NANOG induction also increases ABCG2 mRNA expression in both LNCaP and MCF7
cells. ABCG2 is a membrane transporter that effluxes toxicants and mediates the sidepopulation (SP) phenotype. Both MCF7 (Engelmann et al., 2008) and LAPC9 PCa
(Patrawala et al., 2005) SP cells are enriched in tumor-initiating cells and NANOG mRNA is
enriched in the MCF7 SP (Jeter et al., 2009). Reciprocally, ABCG2 has been proposed to
mark normal prostate SCs and prostate CSCs (Huss et al., 2005) and prospectively purified
ABCG2+ PCa cells consistently demonstrate ∼10× higher tumorigenic potential than the
corresponding ABCG2- cells (Patrawala et al., 2005). NANOG overexpression further
induces the expression of ALDH1A1, another detoxification protein, in MCF7 cells.
ALDH1A1 is the primary ALDH isoform mediating the ALDEFLUOR phenotype, which
has been shown to enrich for normal SCs as well as CSCs (Ginestier et al., 2007) including
prostate CSCs (Li et al., 2010; van den Hoogen et al., 2010). Accompanying the increase in
ALDH1A1 mRNA levels, NANOG dramatically increases the abundance of ALDEFLUORhi MCF7 and Du145 cells. Prospectively purified ALDEFLUOR-hi Du145, PC3, and
LAPC9 cells all possess much higher tumor-initiating capacities in limiting dilution tumor
assays than the corresponding ALDEFLUOR-lo cells (Liu et al., unpublished observations).

Author Manuscript

Finally, NANOG induces CD44 mRNA in some cancer cells. CD44, individually or in
combination with other molecules, is one of the most widely used CSC markers. For
example, the first report on solid tumor CSCs in human breast cancer used the
CD44+CD24-/lo profile (Al-Hajj et al., 2005). We have shown that the CD44+ PCa cell
population is highly enriched in tumor-initiating and metastatic cells (Patrawala et al., 2006,
2007). Knocking down of CD44 significantly inhibits tumor regeneration and/or metastasis
in multiple PCa models (Liu et al., 2011). Notably, NANOG seems to be enriched in CD44+
breast (Bourguignon et al., 2008), ovarian (Zhang et al., 2008), and prostate (Jeter et al.,
2009; Klarmann et al., 2009) cancer cells.

Simultaneous induction by NANOG of such CSC markers/molecules as CD133, CD44,
ABCG2, and ALDH1A1 has likely contributed to the NANOG-conferred CSC phenotypes/
properties and further supports NANOG as an important regulator of CSCs.
NANOG overexpression promotes AI phenotypes and castration-resistant PCa
regeneration

Author Manuscript

One of the most significant findings from our study is that NANOG expression is associated
with AI and castration resistance in PCa cells. The first hint for such an association comes
from the promoter-tracking studies, in which we find that NANOGP8-expressing LNCaP
cells possess extended and much enhanced survivability in androgen-deprived conditions.
Subsequent gain-of-function studies provide convincing evidence that NANOG
overexpression promotes clonogenicity and tumor regeneration of LNCaP cells in androgendeprived conditions/hosts. These results suggest that NANOG might contribute to PCa
progression to a hormone-refractory state. In support, whole-genome cDNA microarray
analysis shows that NANOG is preferentially expressed in PCa cells that express low levels
of PSA, the population naturally resistant to androgen blockade (Qin et al., unpublished
observations). In further support, NANOG overexpression also enhances tumor regeneration
in AR- and AI Du145 cells.

Author Manuscript

What mechanisms might be responsible for NANOG-conferred AI phenotypes and
castration resistance? One mechanism is likely related to NANOG-promoted CSC
phenotypes and properties discussed above. Prostate CSCs seem to express low levels of AR
and thus are intrinsically less dependent on AR signaling (Collins et al., 2005; Li et al.,
2009; Patrawala et al., 2006). In support of this connection, we have previously reported
reciprocal nuclear expression between AR and NANOG (Jeter et al., 2009) and we have
shown here that NANOG-overexpressing LNCaP cells express lower levels of AR,
especially in tumors developed in castrated hosts.

Author Manuscript

NANOG promotes the expression of other molecules such as Bcl-2, IGFBP-5 and CXCR4,
which might also be involved in NANOG-mediated castration resistance in LNCaP cells.
Bcl-2 is an anti-apoptotic protein and its overexpression has been strongly implicated in the
development of castration-resistant PCa (McDonell et al., 1992). IGFBP-5 mRNA and
protein are upregulated in response to castration and exogenous IGFBP-5 stimulates the
proliferation of immortalized prostate epithelial cells (Xu et al., 2007). Also, overexpression
of IGFBP-5 accelerates the proliferation of LNCaP cells in androgen-deprived conditions in
a PI3K-dependent manner (Miyake et al., 2000). IGFBP-5 is known to regulate IGF-1
receptor signaling, which has been implicated in LNCaP (and LAPC-9) PCa progression to
androgen independence (Nickerson et al., 2001) and is required for the emergence of the
CD133+ drug-resistant PC9 cells (Sharma et al., 2010). Finally, CXCR4 and its cognate
chemokine CXCL12 have been implicated in PCa cell migration and invasion (Frigo et al.,
2009; Singh et al., 2004). A functional consequence of NANOG-promoted CXCR4
expression may be the enhanced migratory capacity of NANOGP8-expressing LNCaP AI
tumor cells.
The mechanisms underlying the NANOG-mediated castration resistance are likely
multifaceted and our ongoing research seeks to further address whether some of these CSC

and AI-associated molecules represent direct NANOG targets and exactly how NANOG
promotes PCa AI progression.
NANOGP8 vs. NANOG1: Similarities and distinctions

Author Manuscript

Throughout the preceding discussions, we mostly used the term NANOG to ‘generically’
refer to the proteins encoded by both NANOG1 and NANOGP8, mainly because the
predicted NANOG1 and NANOGP8 proteins are ∼99% identical (Jeter et al., 2009).
Multiple lines of evidence support the overt similarities between NANOG1 and NANOGP8
proteins. FIRST, most currently used commercial anti-NANOG Abs are raised against
NANOG1 but generally recognize the recombinant NANOGP8 proteins equally well (Jeter
et al., 2009). SECOND, both NANOG1 and NANOGP8 are induced, remarkably, to very
similar levels in cancer cells (Figure 3b-c). It is worth mentioning that the induced
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 are both at much lower levels than endogenous NANOG1 levels
in N-TERA cells (Figure 7b-c), suggesting that somatic cancer cells might not be able to
tolerate very high levels of NANOG as a result of unique biochemical mechanisms
regulating NANOG turnover. THIRD, importantly, NANOG1 and NANOGP8 demonstrate
similar biological effects in many experimental settings. For example, both NANOG1 and
NANOGP8 promote castration-resistant LNCaP tumor development (Figure 5f-g), increase
c-Myc and decrease AR in AI tumors (Figure 6a-c), and enhance the expression of many
same genes such as CD133, IGFBP-5, and ABCG2 (Figure 6e-f; Figure 7e).

Author Manuscript

On the other hand, NANOGP8 is the predominant ‘isoform’ expressed in cancer cells and
may, therefore, have evolved new functions distinct from those of NANOG1 in ESCs. In
support, we have observed, in most assays, much more consistent biological effects with
NANOGP8 overexpression compared to NANOG1 overexpression. For example, only
NANOGP8 promotes, in LNCaP cells, AI sphere and AI foci formation, castration-resistant
tumor development, and cell migration (Figure 5). Likewise, NANOGP8, but not NANOG1,
promotes Du145 tumor development and c-Myc upregulation. At the molecular levels,
NANOGP8 and NANOG1 seem to bind to chromatin-associated targets with different
affinities (Figure 4). Moreover, NANOGP8 and NANOG1 frequently induce different gene
alterations even in the same cell types maintained under the identical conditions (Figure 6ef; Figure 7e). Finally, whole-genome ChIP-Seq analysis has revealed that, although
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 share ∼75% genomic binding sites, the two proteins demonstrate
∼25% distinct binding sites in the genome (Jeter et al., unpublished observations). Further
analysis of the ChIP-Seq data, together with our efforts to elucidate the unique biochemical
properties and signaling partners of NANOG in cancer cells and the interrelationship
between AR/androgen signaling and NANOG, should greatly advance our understanding of
the molecular mechanisms underlying the immortality of cancer cells and development of
castration-resistant PCa.

pieces were implanted subcutaneously into NOD-SCID-γ mice. Early passage HPCa tumor
tissues were subject to enzymatic digestion (type I collagenase, 50 U/ml DNase, 12 h),
followed by trypsin digestion and discontinuous Percoll gradient purification. Lineage
positive cells including hematopoietic, endothelial, and stromal cells were removed using an
antibody cocktail and MACS (Miltenyi Biotec, Auburn, CA, USA) as previously described
(Jeter et al., 2009).
Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)

Total RNA was extracted from cultured cancer cells or tumor pieces (frozen in liquid
nitrogen) using an RNeasy RNA-purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). The ABI
High-Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and random
hexamers were used for cDNA synthesis. Quantitative PCR was performed by the M.D.
Anderson Science-Park Molecular Biology Core Facility using an ABI Prism 7900HT
(Applied Biosystems). File Builder 3.1 software (Applied Biosystems) was used to design
NANOG1 and NANOGP8 specific primers and probes (Supplemental Table S1) required to
discriminate between RNA species arising from either locus. A panel of gene-specific
primer pairs was also used for further expression profiling by the SYBR® Green method
(Supplemental Table S1). The experimental Ct (cycle threshold) was calibrated against that
of GAPDH control product. All amplifications were performed in duplicate. The ΔΔCt
method was used to determine the amount of NANOG product relative to that expressed by
the most benign PCa line, LNCaP (1-fold, 100%). For comparative gene expression
profiling of pLVX cell lines, the RNA levels of a particular gene in the pLVX-NANOG1/P8
cells were presented relative to the pLVX control cells (1-fold, 100%).

inserted into RRL-PGK-GFP1 (Zufferey et al., 1998) as a XhoI – BamH1 fragment before
the GFP transgene to generate RRL-NANOGP8-GFP. The RRL-based lentivirus was
prepared as previously described (Jeter et al., 2009). In brief, G418 selected 293FT cells
(12×106/15 cm dish) were transfected with the RRE (6 μg), REV (4 μg) and VSVg (4 μg)
packaging plasmids, along with a lentiviral vector (6 μg) using Fugene 6 at a 1:2.7 ratio of
DNA (μg) to transfection reagent (μl). Viral supernatants were ultracentrifuged to produce
concentrated viral stocks. Cells were plated 24 h earlier and infected with the indicated
volumes of virus, prepared in parallel, at approximately 50% cell density.
To create the pLVX-TetON-NANOG constructs, the NANOG1 cDNA from N-TERA cells
or NANOGP8 coding region derived from HPCa5 (Jeter et al., 2009) in pCR2.1 (Invitrogen)

Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—ChIP assay was performed by following the
manufacturer's instructions (Upstate, Charlottesville, VA, USA). Cultured pLVX LNCaP
cells (i.e., cells expressing pLVX, pLVX-Nanog1, or pLVX-NanogP8) were treated with
doxycycline (500 ng/ml) for 3-4 d prior to harvest. After cells were fixed, washed, and
collected, their DNA was sheared by sonication in 200 μl of lysis buffer. Then, 20 μl of
sonicated DNA from each sample was purified and used as an input DNA control and the
remainder of the DNA was pre-cleared. The chromatin-bound DNA was
immunoprecipitated with an anti-NANOG antibody (Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA, USA;
H-155) and protein-A beads, and the DNA was eluted from the beads. The precipitated
DNA was analyzed by PCR for 1 cycle at 95°C for 2 min; 35 cycles at 95°C for 20 s, 55°C
for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s; and 1 cycle at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR primers (see
Supplemental Figure S4) included distal E-cadherin promoter (-2273 to -1889 bp, 5′atcagagaggttggttccagtcc-3′ and 5′-gcaatggtgtgttcttggctcac-3′), FGF4 promoter (-1567 to

percentage of GFP+ cells following transduction with the promoter reporter lentiviruses.
50K cells/well in 12-well dishes plated 1-day earlier were transduced with the indicated
volumes of lentivirus. Cultured cells were maintained in fresh media and passaged until
FACS analysis ∼ 5 d post-transduction. c) Immunostaining of NP8-GFP transduced LNCaP
cells for NANOG (red) demonstrates co-localization of GFP and NANOG expression.
Original magnifications, x200. (d-f) FACS purified viable (7AAD-) NP8-GFP+ PCa cells
transduced (7-10 d prior) with the NP8-GFP lentivirus exhibit enhanced cloning efficiency
(C.E.). d) NP8-Du145 cells (200 cells/well in 6-well culture plate) scored 14 d post-plating:
holo, holoclones; mero, meroclones; para, paraclones. *P <0.001. e) NP8-PC3 cells (200
cells/well in 6-well culture plate) scored 14 d post-plating. f) LNCaP cells assayed in
parallel at clonal density in androgen-deprived conditions (CDSS + 20 μM bicalutamide)

a) Schematic of pLVX-TetON (Clontech) binary system to express inducible NANOG1 or
NANOGP8: CMV, cytomegalovirus promoter; Dox, doxycycline; TRE, tetracycline
responsive element. b-c) Western blot analysis of protein extracts (80 μg whole cell lysate)
demonstrates dox-inducible NANOG overexpression. N.S, non-specific band. b) Western
analysis of NANOG in extracts derived from control pLVX MCF-7, Du145 and LNCaP
cells or respective pLVX-NANOG1/P8 clones, either untreated or induced with doxycycline
(500 ng/ml; 48 h). c) Doxycycline titration in MCF-7 pLVX cells as indicated. Note that in
both Western analyses, the endogenous NANOG protein was barely detectable due to
NANOG-expressing cells being very rare (see below). d-e) NANOG IF staining using a Rb
polyclonal anti-NANOG antibody (H-155; Santa Cruz) revealed nuclear NANOG
expression in the majority of clonally-derived cells following dox induction in pLVXNANOG1/P8 Du145 (d) or LNCaP (e) cells.

a-d) Enhanced androgen-independent (AI) growth of NANOG-overexpressing LNCaP cells
relative to the empty vector (pLVX) control. a) pLVX- NANOGP8 expression promotes
LNCaP sphere formation. 2.5K cells (Expt. #1) or 1K (Expt. #2) cells were plated in a 24well dish in Methocult supplemented with B27 and N2 and 500 ng/ml doxycycline. Spheres
(> 100 μM) were scored ∼2 weeks later. Shown below are two representative
microphotographs of spheres formed in methycellulose. b-d) NANOG1 and NANOGP8
overexpression promotes the outgrowth of AI LNCaP cells. The three types of LNCaP cells
(2K cells/well, plated in a 6-well TC dish) were cultured in CDSS-containing media for up
to 30 d, feeding (+ 500 ng/ml doxycycline) every 3-5 d. Bright-field microscopy was used to
capture AI foci and floating spheres (b). Shown in c) is quantification of AI-foci at two
different time points and in d) is the total number of live cells/well at d30. e) NANOGoverexpressing LNCaP cells (1 × 106/injection) implanted s.c in NOD/SCID-γ males
generated larger tumors than the pLVX-control cells (all harvested at d35). f-g)
NANOG1/P8 overexpression promotes castration-resistant LNCaP tumor regeneration. The
three types of pLVX LNCaP cells were implanted (10K/injection) s.c in either intact or fully
castrated (i.e., surgical castration plus bicalutamide treatment) NOD/SCID-γ mice and
tumors were harvested 41 (intact) and 61 (castrated) days after implantation. Shown are
