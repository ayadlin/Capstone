ABSTRACT
Podoplanin (PDPN) enhances tumor metastases by eliciting tumor cell-induced
platelet aggregation (TCIPA) through activation of platelet C-type lectin-like receptor 2
(CLEC-2). A novel and non-cytotoxic 5-nitrobenzoate compound 2CP was synthesized that
specifically inhibited the PDPN/CLEC-2 interaction and TCIPA with no effect on platelet
aggregation stimulated by other platelet agonists. 2CP possessed anti-cancer metastatic
activity in vivo and augmented the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in the experimental
animal model without causing a bleeding risk. Analysis of the molecular action of 2CP
further revealed that Akt1/PDK1 and PKCμ were two alternative CLEC-2 signaling
pathways mediating PDPN-induced platelet activation. 2CP directly bound to CLEC-2
and, by competing with the same binding pocket of PDPN in CLEC-2, inhibited PDPNmediated platelet activation. This study provides evidence that 2CP is the first defined
platelet antagonist with CLEC-2 binding activity. The augmentation in the therapeutic
efficacy of cisplatin by 2CP suggests that a combination of a chemotherapeutic agent
and a drug with anti-TCIPA activity such as 2CP may prove clinically effective.

from the primary tumor site survives in the blood stream
and causes metastasis [1]. The interaction between
circulating tumor cells and platelets often results in tumor
cell-induced platelet aggregation (TCIPA) that facilitates
hematogenous tumor metastasis [1, 2]. A number of antiTCIPA agents for blocking cancer metastases have been
developed [3–6]. Aspirin, apyrase, tissue inhibitor of

metalloproteinase-4, BM-567, XV454 and Abciximab
are among the agents that inhibit tumor cell-platelet
interactions and cancer metastases [7–11]. Treatment
of cancer patients with these agents usually causes an
increase in bleeding risk because most of the anti-TCIPA
agents act on the platelet haemostatic proteins [4, 5,
12, 13]. Development of anti-TCIPA agents that do not
interfere with physiological haemostasis is crucial for their
utility as part of an anti-cancer therapeutic regimen.
Podoplanin (PDPN) is among the most frequently
upregulated genes in squamous cell carcinoma,
central nervous system tumors and germinal neoplasia
[14, 15]. PDPN induces platelet aggregation by binding and
activation of the C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2)
[16, 17] leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of Src family
kinases, Syk, and phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2) [18–
22]. PDPN enhances metastatic foci formation and tumor
progression without affecting tumor growth in animal
studies [16]. The metastatic potency of cancer and the
frequency of tumor cells embolized in the microvasculature
of the lung are correlated with the platelet aggregation
activity of PDPN [16, 23–25]. Specific inhibition of CLEC2 signaling should not affect physiological haemostasis
because CLEC-2-deficient platelets respond normally to the
platelet agonists of collagen, ADP, U46619 and proteaseactivated receptor 4 peptide [26]. This indicates that PDPNinduced platelet-tumor cell interaction is a potential target
for the development of an anti-metastases regimen.
This study involves an investigation of a novel small
synthesized compound 2CP, a derivative of 4-O-benzoyl3-methoxy-beta-nitrostyrene (BMNS), which specifically
binds to CLEC-2 and inhibits PDPN-induced TCIPA. 2CP
elicits and augments the therapeutic efficacy of anti-cancer
drugs without affecting normal haemostasis in the mouse
xenograft model. Novel signaling proteins transmitting
PDPN-activated CLEC-2 signaling are also defined. The
significance of these findings in the development of an
anti-cancer regimen is discussed.

PDPN or collagen, and strong inhibition on thrombin-,
ADP- or U46619-stimulated platelet aggregation. 2CP
inhibited PDPN-induced platelet aggregation with the
IC50 equivalent of 12.1 ± 4.8 μM (Figure 1B and Table 1),
but had little effect on platelet aggregation induced by
the CLEC-2 agonist rhodocytin or either by thrombin,
collagen, ADP or U46619 (Figure 1B and 1C). The IC50s
of 2CP for these agonists were all >100 μM (Table 1).
These results indicate that 2CP selectively inhibits PDPNinduced platelet aggregation.

2CP inhibits PDPN-induced TCIPA
C6/Lung cells were used as the cancer cell model
to address whether 2CP is able to inhibit PDPN-induced
TCIPA. This was based on the findings that C6/Lung
cells expressed high levels of PDPN and induced platelet
aggregation (Figure 2A) and the formation of tumor cellplatelet aggregates (Figure 2B). In contrast, the parental
C6/LG cells did not express PDPN and were not able to
induce platelet aggregation and form tumor cell-platelet
aggregates (Figure 2A and 2B). Expression of PDPN short
hairpin RNA in C6/Lung cells abrogated C6/Lung cellsinduced platelet aggregation (Figure 2C), implying that
PDPN is the key molecule mediating TCIPA.
TCIPA assays were performed by incubation of
C6/Lung cells with human platelets in the presence or
absence of 2CP. 2CP inhibited C6/Lung cells-induced
platelet aggregation (Figure 2D, left panel) and caused
the turbidity of the reaction mixture (Figure 2D, center
panel). The time to reach 50% aggregation for the control
and 2CP-treated group was 496.5 ± 65.4 sec (n = 41)
and 910.6 ± 123.1 sec (n = 39), respectively (Figure 2D,
right panel, p < 0.01). The lactose dehydrogenase (LDH)
release and caspase 3/7 activity assays revealed that 2CP
did not cause cytotoxic or apoptotic effects in platelets and
tumor cells. This implies that cell stress or cell death does
not account for the inhibitory activity of 2CP on TCIPA
induced by C6/Lung cells (Figure 2E and Figure 2F). 2CP
also inhibited TCIPA induced by the human osteosarcoma
cell lines HOS and MG63, which express high levels of
PDPN (Figure 3). These results indicate that 2CP inhibits
PDPN-mediated TCIPA.

Effects of 2CP on mouse tail bleeding time and
pulmonary metastases in the mouse xenograft
model

BMNS, the non-selective inhibitor of agonistinduced platelet aggregation [27–31] was used as
the lead compound to chemically synthesize BMNSrelated derivatives RX1, RX41 and 2CP (Figure 1A,
Supplementary method and Supplementary Figure S1).
The effects of these compounds on agonist-induced
platelet aggregation were analyzed. BMNS and RX41 nonselectively inhibited platelet aggregation induced by all
agonists examined in this study including PDPN, thrombin,
collagen, ADP and U46619 (Figure 1B). RX1 possessed

The effects of 2CP on in vivo platelet function were
evaluated by intravenous delivery of 2CP into the B6 mice
followed by the tail bleeding time assay (Figure 4A). The
dosage of 3.5 mg/kg that is equivalent to 5 times the Kd (24.5
± 3.7 μM) for the binding of PDPN and CLEC-2 [18] was
used in this assay. There was no difference in the bleeding
time between the control (87.4 ± 8.1 sec, n = 23) and 2CPtreated (85.6 ± 7.1 sec, n = 21) mice (p = 0.87). The bleeding

the dosage of 2 mg/kg (300 IU/kg for heparin and 200 IU/kg
for LMWH), which was commonly used in the inhibition of
cancer metastases in the mouse xenograft model [32–35], the
tail bleeding time was 333.5 ± 11.7 sec (n = 11) and 169.9
± 30.8 sec (n = 11) for heparin and LMWH, respectively.

The bleeding time of the animals was significantly prolonged
by heparin and LMWH when compared to the control and
2CP (p < 0.01). 2CP thereby elicits no deleterious effects on
normal haemostasis.
The mouse xenograft model was then used to
investigate whether 2CP has any effect on pulmonary
metastases of C6/Lung cells. 2CP was injected into nude

Tumor formation was monitored by bioluminescence
imaging analysis and histopathological examination of
the lung tissue at day 15 after intravenous delivery of C6/
Lung cells into the mice. Both 2CP (p < 0.05) and CDDP
(p < 0.01) decreased the bioluminescence signal and the
number of metastatic foci (Figure 4C and 4D). Combined
treatment of the mice with 2CP and CDDP further
decreased the bioluminescence signal and the number
of tumor metastatic foci when compared with the mice
treated with CDDP alone (p < 0.01). The metastatic area
for the control, 2CP, CDDP, and the combined treatment of
2CP and CDDP was 54.4% ± 1.8% (n = 17), 46.7% ± 2.1%
(n = 17), 35.6% ± 3.3% (n = 16), and 19.1% ± 1.8%
(n = 15) of the surface area examined, respectively
(Figure 4D).
The body weight loss for each treatment group
as recorded at day 21 after inoculation of cancer cells
revealed that 2CP alone had no effect on the animals
(Figure 4E). When combined with CDDP, 2CP reduced
the degree of body weight loss concomitantly with
the decrease in tumor burden (Figure 4E, p < 0.01).
Consistent with these findings, 2CP alone did not extend
the lifespan of the mice, while CDDP increased the
survival of the animals (p = 0.015) when compared with
the control group (Figure 5). Combined treatment of 2CP
and CDDP caused a further increase in the lifespan of
the mice when compared with the control (p < 0.001)
or CDDP treatment alone (p = 0.008). In contrast to the
in vivo effects of 2CP on the metastases of C6/Lung
cells and animal survival, in C6/LG cells that did not
express PDPN, 2CP did not prolong animal survival
and did not decrease the lung metastatic foci formation
(Supplementary Figure S2). These data imply that 2CP
specifically inhibits the growth and metastases of cancer
cells expressing PDPN.
We further address whether 2CP suppresses lung
metastasis and increases animal survival when tumor

injection preceded the delivery of 2CP into the mice
(Supplementary Figure S3A). Our data revealed that
combined treatment of mice with 2CP and CDDP slightly
decreased the tumor burden (p = 0.07) but did not affect
the percentage of body weight loss when compared to
CDDP alone (Supplementary Figure S3B and S3C). 2CP
was effective in prolonging animal survival. The survival
fraction of the mice was 0%, 14.2%, 28.4% and 56.8%
for the treatment with vehicle control, 2CP, CDDP, and
the combined treatment of 2CP and CDDP, respectively
(Supplementary Figure S3D). These data reinforce the
notion that 2CP is effective in prolonging the survival of
animals bearing PDPN-expressing tumors.

2CP reveals novel platelet CLEC-2 signaling
The effect of 2CP on PDPN- and rhodocytin-induced
platelet protein tyrosine phosphorylation was analyzed and
compared to determine the molecular basis of 2CP on the
inhibition of PDPN-induced platelet aggregation and TCIPA
(Figure 6A). Both PDPN and rhodocytin induced tyrosine
phosphorylation of platelet proteins. Consistent with the
differential effects of 2CP on PDPN- and rhodocytin-induced
platelet aggregation (Figure 1C), only the phosphorylation
induced by PDPN was suppressed by 2CP (Figure 6A).
When the individual signaling proteins downstream
of CLEC-2 were analyzed (Figure 6B), both PDPN
and rhodocytin induced the phosphorylation of PLCγ2
(Y1217), SLP76 (Y145) and Syk (Y525/526). Other Sykactivated signaling proteins including Akt1 (S473), PKCμ
(S748), p38 (Y180/Y182) and cytosolic phospholipase A2
(cPLA2-S505) were also phosphorylated after stimulation
of platelets with PDPN and rhodocytin. 2CP inhibited
PDPN- but not rhodocytin-induced phosphorylation of these
proteins. On the other hand, pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase
1 (PDK1-S241) phosphorylation was decreased by PDPN
and rhodocytin with 2CP reversing the effects of PDPN but
not rhodocytin. These findings indicate that 2CP selectively
suppresses PDPN-induced CLEC-2 signaling despite the

PDPN [16, 24, 41]. Clinical studies of human cancer
tissues indicate that PDPN expression is associated with
aggressive phenotypes of human cancer and is a poor
prognostic marker in esophageal, oral, lung and cervical
cancers [15, 39, 42–46]. PDPN is therefore a notable
candidate for development of cancer-targeted therapy.
Various approaches for preventing PDPN/CLEC-2
interactions have been developed for anti-cancer therapy.
Promising results using anti-PDPN antibody were
demonstrated in several preclinical studies. The anti-PDPN
antibodies NZ-1 and NZ-8 induced antibody-dependent
cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent
cytotoxicity in eliminating cancer cells and suppressing
TCIPA, tumor growth and tumor metastases [47–49].
The chimeric anti-PDPN antibodies ChMS-1 and hP2–0
were developed to prevent cancer growth and metastases
[25, 50]. The anti-PDPN antibodies NZ-1 that are either
radiolabeled with N-succinimidyl 4-guanidinomethyl
3-[131I]iodobenzoate or fused to Pseudomonas exotoxin A
carrying a C-terminal KDEL peptide exhibited significant
suppression in the tumor growth of malignant glioma
[51, 52]. The cost of antibody production and the potential
immune response associated with antibody delivery limit
the progress for clinical usage of these agents. 2CP has
the potential for overcoming the costs associated with
the usage of anti-PDPN antibodies because its simple
chemical synthesis and its low molecular weight allows
for its mass production. Based on the current study and the
concept of rational drug design, a series of derivatives of
2CP can be synthesized to further improve the inhibitory
efficacy of 2CP on PDPN-induced platelet aggregation
associated with cancer growth and metastases.
2CP alone is not as effective as co-treatment of
2CP with CDDP in the experimental metastases model.
This is explainable by the fact that host immunity or
cytotoxic agents are required to eliminate cancer cells
from the bloodstream to effectively inhibit metastases
[5, 25, 52, 53]. 2CP is not cytotoxic and does not kill
cancer cells. Instead, 2CP suppresses TCIPA and reduces
the rate and the ratio of tumor embolization to the distant
organs. Interfering with TCIPA is not sufficient to inhibit
the growth of tumor cells and prevent the formation
of metastatic foci. This notion is consistent with the
observation that most anti-TCIPA agents are cytostatic,
but not cytotoxic [4]. 2CP can therefore be considered as
an adjuvant agent for cancer treatment in the presence of
anti-cancer cytotoxic regimens.
The molecular basis of 2CP on the inhibition
of PDPN-induced platelet aggregation and TCIPA is
also addressed in this study. The parental compound of
2CP is a protein kinase inhibitor [30, 31]. Although the
phosphorylation/activation of CLEC-2 signaling proteins
such as Syk, PLCγ, and SLP76 are all suppressed in 2CPtreated platelets, 2CP does not appear to play a direct
role as a protein kinase inhibitor. This is supported by the
finding that 2CP has no effect on the in vitro activity of the
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

protein kinases that are downstream of CLEC-2 signaling
or are related to platelet activation. The differential effects
of 2CP on platelet aggregation and protein phosphorylaton/
activation induced by PDPN and rhodocytin, which share
most of the CLEC-2 signaling pathways, further argue
against the action of 2CP as a protein kinase or signaling
protein inhibitor in platelets. An emerging question is: how
does 2CP specifically inhibits PDPN- but not rhodocytininduced platelet aggregation? Distinct binding properties
of CLEC-2 with PDPN and rhodocytin were proposed
despite the fact that the same amino acid residues Arg107,
Arg118, Arg152, and Arg157 of CLEC-2 contribute to
the interaction with both PDPN and rhodocytin [54].
Different sites of Arg118 in CLEC-2 are involved in the
binding of the O-glycan of PDPN and the C-terminal
Tyr136 of rhodocytin. 2CP interacts with the amino acid
residues Asn105, Arg107, Phe116, Arg118 and Arg157
of CLEC-2. These results imply that 2CP interacts with
the key amino acid residues (Arg 107, Arg 118 and Arg
157) involved in PDPN/CLEC-2 binding [54]. Hence,
2CP is likely to integrate into the same binding pocket or
spatial location of PDPN and interfere with the binding
of PDPN, but not rhodocytin, to CLEC-2. This binding
model may explain the reason for the specific inhibition
of PDPN-induced platelet aggregation and TCIPA by 2CP.
Alternatively, the differential effect of 2CP on PDPN- and
rhodocytin-induced CLEC-2 activation can be explained
by the distinct binding affinity of CLEC-2 to PDPN and
CLEC-2 to rhodocytin, which is equivalent to 24.5 μM
and 1 μM, respectively [18, 55]. 2CP is likely to compete
more efficiently in the interaction of CLEC-2 with PDPN
than in the interaction with rhodocytin. Both models
explain the specific inhibition of PDPN-induced platelet
aggregation and TCIPA by 2CP.
In addition to the activation of the known
signaling proteins Syk, SLP76 and PLCγ2, PDPN and
rhodocytin induce the phosphorylation of Akt1 (S473),
PKCμ (S748), p38 (Y180/Y182), and cPLA2 (S505)
but suppress the phosphorylation of PDK1 (S241).
2CP selectively reverses the phosphorylation status of
these protein kinases induced by PDPN in association
with the selective inhibition of PDPN-induced platelet
aggregation. These findings are consistent with previous
studies of various signaling pathways suggesting that
Akt, PKCμ, p38, and cPLA2 are the Syk downstream
effectors [56–59]. p38 phosphorylation was observed in
rhodocytin-triggered CLEC-2 activation of monocytes/
macrophages [60]. BCR-mediated p38 activation is Lynand Syk-dependent [57]. Syk also regulates FcγRIIAinduced LAT phosphorylation and activation of PI3K/
Akt and p38 [61]. PKCμ coprecipitates with both Syk
and PLC-γ1/2 [59], and is activated in the DT40 B cell
line in a Syk-dependent manner [57]. cPLA2 activation
by β-glucan is dependent on the activation of Syk in
macrophages [62]. PDK1 (S241) phosphorylation is
suppressed during PDPN-induced platelet aggregation

which can be reversed by 2CP. Autophosphorylation
at Ser241 is important for PDK1 kinase activity, which
is negatively regulated by binding to 14–3-3 through
the PDK1 autophosphorylation site Ser241 [63]. While
PI3K/PDK1/Akt signaling is the downstream effectors
of Syk [58, 61, 64] and is related to platelet activation
and aggregation [65, 66], the phosphorylation at Ser241
and the binding to 14–3-3 are most likely involved in the
control of PDPN-induced PDK1 activity. These findings
lay the foundation for uncovering novel signaling proteins
upon CLEC-2 activation.
In conclusion, a new and non-cytotoxic small
molecule compound 2CP was synthesized that binds to
CLEC-2 and inhibits PDPN-induced CLEC-2 activation,
platelet aggregation and TCIPA. Novel therapeutic
usage of 2CP and the identification of notable CLEC-2
signaling molecules were found by analyzing the effect
of 2CP on metastases in experimental animals and on
PDPN-induced platelet activation. 2CP has potential
as an anti-metastatic agent in cancer and as a tool for
elucidating the molecular mechanism of PDPN-induced
CLEC-2 activation.

Preparation of washed human platelets
Fresh blood was drawn from informed healthy
volunteers without taking any drugs at least two weeks
prior to this study. For preparation of washed human
platelets [67], platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained
from whole blood mixed with 3.2% trisodium citrate (9:1)
by centrifugation at 200 g for 20 min. The platelets were
then prepared from PRP by centrifugation (900 g, 10 min)
and washed twice with Tyrode’s buffer (137 mM NaCl,
2.65 mM KCl, 12 mM NaHCO3, 0.43 mM NaH2PO4,
2 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 5 mM glucose, 5 mM HEPES,
pH 7.35) containing 0.5 μM PGI2 and 0.2 unit/ml apyrase.
Finally, washed platelets were re-suspended in Tyrode’s
buffer and adjusted to 3 × 108/ml for platelet aggregation
or 1 × 109/ml for PDPN- or tumor cells-induced platelet
aggregation assays.

Platelet aggregation and TCIPA

or tumor cells (4 × 103) were placed in a 96-well white
microplate in the absence or presence of 2CP (20 or
100 μM) for various time points (0, 0.25, 4 and 24 h)
at 37°C. Then an equal volume of Caspase-Glo assay
reagent was added to the cells. The reaction mixtures were
incubated for 1 h at 37°C. The luminescence signal was
measured by using a SpectraMax luminometer (Molecular
Devices). Cells treated with staurosporine (2 μM) were
used as a positive control for caspase activity.

Washed platelet suspension was pre-incubated with
the solvent vehicle or test compounds for 3 min at 37°C
with stirring at 900 rpm [67]. Then, platelet aggregation
was triggered by the addition of PDPN (4 μg), thrombin
(0.1 U/ml), collagen (2 μg/ml), U46619 (2 μM), ADP
(20 μM) or tumor cells (1.5 × 106 cells). The platelet
aggregations and TCIPA were monitored and recorded
for 15–20 min by using an aggregometer with Aggro/Link
processing software (Chrono-Log Corp., Havertown, PA).
The time to reach 50% maximal aggregation was recorded
and defined as the aggregation time.
For observation of tumor cell-platelet aggregation
by fluorescent microscopy, platelets or tumor cells were
pre-loaded with 2 μM fluorescence cell trace dyes (green
calcein-AM for platelets and red/orange calcein-AM
for tumor cells) at 37°C for 30 min, then washed, resuspended, and adjusted the cell number for use. Briefly,
calcein-AM green-labeled platelets (1 × 109/ml, green)
were incubated with the calcein-AM orange/red-labeled
cells (1.5 × 106, red) in a reaction tube to trigger TCIPA in
an aggregometer. The reaction was terminated when the
degree of aggregation for C6/Lung cells reached 30% of
the light transmission. All reaction mixtures were removed
from the tube and placed on a glass slide for fluorescence
analysis. The fluorescence hetero-aggregates of platelets
and tumor cells were examined by using a Zeiss Axiovert
200M microscope (Carl Zeiss, Germany).

Experimental pulmonary metastases, body
weight loss and animal survival analyses
Cancer cells (1.75 × 105/100 μl) were intravenously
injected into 7–8 week old BALB/c-nu/nu mice. The test
compounds were intravenously injected into the mice
(2CP, 3.5 mg/kg; and CDDP, 2.5 mg/kg). At day 15 postinjection of tumor cells, in vivo bioluminescence imaging
analysis of lung metastatic foci were measured using a
Xenogen IVIS-100 fluorescence image system (Xenogen,
Alameda, CA). The relative region of intensity (R.O.I) was
analyzed for tumor growth. Lung tissue was extirpated
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for histologic
examination by a Zeiss PrimoStar microscope (Carl
Zeiss, Gottingen, Germany). The metastatic areas of the
lung were analyzed and quantified using Zeiss AxioVision
software (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The corresponding
metastatic area was expressed as a percentage of the whole
lung. The body weight loss was recorded at day 21 after
tumor inoculation. The percentage of the weight difference
was calculated using the equation of [(Day 0 - Day 21)/
Day 0] x 100%. The survival of the animals was recorded
and the data were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier
survival curve and log rank test.

Cytotoxicity assays with lactose dehydrogenase
release and caspase activity measurement
The LDH activity assay kit was used to evaluate the
cytotoxic effects of 2CP on platelets and culture cells. The
assay was performed as described by the manufacturer.
Briefly, platelets (1 × 109/ml) were incubated with 2CP
(10–100 μM) and stirred at 900 rpm for 15 min. The
supernatants for LDH measurement were collected by first
centrifugation at 3000 g for 5 min followed by another
centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min. For tumor cells
(1 × 106), monolayer confluent cells were treated with 2CP
(20 μM) for 0–12 h and the supernatants were collected by
centrifugation as described above. Supernatants (100 μl)
were mixed in an optical 96-well flat microplate with
45 μl of the assay reaction mixture containing diaphorase,
NAD+, tetrazolium INT and lactate. After incubation at
room temperature for 30 min, the reaction was stopped
by adding 50 μl of stop solution. The LDH activity of the
sample was determined by measuring the absorbance at the
wavelength of 490 nm. As a control, the supernatant from
the platelets/cells that were lysed by 1% triton X-100 was
used as a control for measuring the total amount of LDH.
The measurement of caspase activity was performed
using a Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, platelets (1 × 108)

Tail bleeding time assay
The tail bleeding time assay was performed as
described previously [67–68]. Briefly, mice (7–8 weeks
old) were intravenously injected with 2CP (3.5 mg/kg),
heparin (2 mg/kg, equivalent to 300 IU/kg), LMWH
(2 mg/kg, equivalent to 200 IU/kg) or vehicle control. Ten
min after injection, mice were anesthetized and 0.5 cm of
the distal tail was cut with a scalpel. The amputated tail
was immediately immersed and placed in physiological
saline pre-warmed to 37°C. The bleeding time was
recorded from the moment of transection until blood flow
ceased. Observations were stopped at 360 sec even if
bleeding did not cease. A bleeding time longer than 360
sec was set as 360 sec.

Western blot analysis
For isolation of platelet lysates, the platelets were
mixed with 5X ice-cold lysis buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl,
pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 5% Triton X-100, 5 mM EGTA,
42744

Oncotarget

5 mM EDTA, 5 mM PMSF, 5 mM Na3VO4, 20 μg/ml
leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin) and kept on ice for 4 h
[67]. Proteins were solubilized by adding sample buffer
to the final concentration of 60 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 2%
SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.1% bromophenol blue, and 50 mM
DTT. The lysates were then boiled at 95°C for 10 min
followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). For isolation of cell lysates,
cultured cells (2 × 106/ml) were harvested and washed
twice with ice-cold 1X PBS. Then, cells were solubilized
in 1X ice-cold lysis buffer [69] and kept on ice for 4 h.
After first centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min to remove
cell debris, the supernatants were collected for second
centrifugation (10,000 g, 5 min) followed by protein
quantification.
The extracted proteins were fractionated by SDSPAGE and transferred to PVDF membrane (Pall Corp., Ann
Arbor, MI) using the Bio-Rad electrotransfer system. The
membranes were blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk at 4°C
overnight and incubated with the indicated primary antibody
that recognizes the desired targets. After washing with
Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T)
four times, the membranes were incubated with the HRPconjugated secondary antibody (1:20000) for 45 min at room
temperature. After washing twice with TBS-T, the proteins
were detected by using an enhanced chemiluminescence
detection kit (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA).

binding was eliminated and controlled by subtraction of
the reference flow cell signal and running buffer wash.
KD values and sensorgrams were analyzed with Biacore
Evaluation software 1.0 (GE Healthcare). For kinetic
binding experiments, recombinant CLEC-2 (20 μg/ml)
was immobilized on a CM5 biosensor chip surface by
amine-coupling (10 mM acetate, pH 5.0) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. Then, various concentrations
(2.5 to 60 μM) of 2CP were injected for 2 min at 30 μl/
ml flow rate onto the pre-immobilized CLEC-2 chip
surface to record the 2CP-CLEC-2 interaction followed
by calculating the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD).

Statistical analysis
All experiments were repeated at least three times
and results were expressed as means ± S.E. Differences
between the sample-treated group and control group were
analyzed by unpaired Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney
U-test, and one-way ANOVA using the Prism statistical
software version 4.0 (San Diego, CA, USA), where
appropriate. The survival rate of the animals was examined
by the Kaplan-Meier curve and log rank test. Results were
considered statistically significant at a value of P < 0.05.

Candidate compound molecular docking
modeling
For docking studies, the three-dimensional structure
of 2CP was constructed using a Chem 3D ultra 9.0 software
Chemical Structure Drawing Standard (CambridgeSoft
Corporation, Waltham, MA). The crystal structure of
CLEC-2 (PDB ID 3WSR) was retrieved from the RCSB
Protein Data Bank. The water molecules were discarded,
and the hydrogen atoms were added to the protein with
Discovery Studio 4.0 (Accelrys, San Diego, CA). The
forcefield CHARMm function was used to roughly search
the conformations when compounds docked on to CLEC-2,
and then the modified active site of CLEC-2 was selected
as the binding site for the study. The conformations of
2CP were optimized using the same force field function,
and then flexibly docked in a stepwise manner with the
protocol of Dock ligands (Libdock) in Discovery Studio
4.0 and LibDock scores as scoring functions.
