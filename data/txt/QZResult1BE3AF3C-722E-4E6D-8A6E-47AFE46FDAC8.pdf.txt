ABSTRACT
One mechanism of resistance of prostate cancer (PCa) to enzalutamide
(MDV3100) treatment is the increased expression of AR variants lacking the ligand
binding-domain, the best characterized of which is AR-V7. We have previously
reported that Phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase alpha (PIP5Kα), is a lipid
kinase that links to CDK1 and AR pathways. The discovery of PIP5Kα inhibitor
highlight the potential of PIP5K1α as a drug target in PCa. In this study, we show
that AR-V7 expression positively correlates with PIP5K1α in tumor specimens from
PCa patients. Overexpression of AR-V7 increases PIP5K1α, promotes rapid growth
of PCa in xenograft mice, whereas inhibition of PIP5K1α by its inhibitor ISA-2011B
suppresses the growth and invasiveness of xenograft tumors overexpressing AR-V7.
PIP5K1α is a key co-factor for both AR-V7 and AR, which are present as protein-protein
complexes predominantly in the nucleus of PCa cells. In addition, PIP5K1α and CDK1
influence AR-V7 expression also through AKT-associated mechanism dependent on
PTEN-status. ISA-2011B disrupts protein stabilization of AR-V7 which is dependent on
PIP5K1α, leading to suppression of invasive growth of AR-V7-high tumors in xenograft
mice. Our study suggests that combination of enzalutamide and PIP5K1α may have
a significant impact on refining therapeutic strategies to circumvent resistance to
antiandrogen therapies.

longer responsive to anti-androgen therapies [1-4]. One
mechanism of resistance to antiandrogen treatment is the
increased expression of AR variants lacking the ligand
binding-domain, the best characterized of which is ARV7 [5-7]. AR-V7 is a constitutive active variant lacking
the LBD encoded by exon 4-8, owing to utilization of a
cryptic exon [7]. AR-V7 expression is significantly higher
in CRPC specimens than in specimens from hormonenaïve PCa and is associated with worse clinical outcome,
suggesting an important role of AR-V7 in development of
CRPC [8, 9].
Enzalutamide inhibits recruitment of AR
coactivators and prevents AR nuclear localization [10].
Although enzalutamide is beneficial for patients with
metastatic CRPC, giving an increasing in survival [11,
12], a rapid development of resistance in PCa patients
to enzalutamide treatment remain to be a major clinical
challenge [11]. The increased level of AR-V7 transcript
was detected in circulating tumor cells from PCa patients
who developed enzalutamide resistance [13]. It is believed
that AR-V7 lacking the LBD evades enzalutamide, which
acts via the LBD [11, 14]. However, the AR-V7-mediated
cellular mechanisms in resistance to enzalutamide remain
poorly understood.
Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase alpha
(PIP5K1α) and its phospholipid product PIP2 have
emerged as a new class of predictive biomarkers and drug
targets in prostate cancer [15]. PIP5K1α is a lipid kinase
similar to PI3K and acts on PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathways,
and thereby regulates cell survival and migration [16].
PIP5K1α produces PIP2, a major substrate for triggering
PI3K/AKT activity which is also regulated by PTEN
to turn off the over-activated AKT [17]. Related to
this, alterations in AR and PI3K/AKT/PTEN signaling
complexes cooperatively contribute to PCa progression
[18, 19]. We recently described a selective PIP5K1α
inhibitor, ISA-2011B, which blocks the PI3K/AKT
pathway by decreasing AKT phosphorylation at Serine
473 (pAKT S473), and suppresses growth of aggressive
tumors in xenograft mice [15, 20, 21]. Further, we have
shown that PIP5K1α cross-interacts with AR, and ISA2011B significantly inhibits AR and PSA expression and
induced apoptotic cell death in LNCaP cells[15].
CDK1 is the most essential kinase in CDK family,
and is sufficient to drive cell division cycle in mammalian
cells [22]. CDK1 is in complex with cyclin B1 and
cyclin A, and is a component of the PI3K/AKT kinase
network. This network is upregulated by extracellular
chemokines in PCa cells during invasion [23]. Indeed,
CDK1 phosphorylates AR and thereby enhances AR
activity during progression of castration resistant PCa
[24] . However, the precise role of CDK1 in driving PCa
progression is unclear.
In the present study, we have studied the role of ARV7 and its functional association with PIP5K1α and CDK1
in PCa progression using PCa cell lines and xenograft
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

mouse models. We have further investigated whether the
PIP5K1α inhibitor, ISA-2011B might suppress the growth
of AR-V7-overexpressing tumors and selectively block the
deregulated AR-V7 pathways in xenograft mouse models.
Our study identifies novel cooperative mechanisms
involving PIP5K1α, AR-V7, CDK1 and AR, which
drive tumor progression and contribute to enzalutamide
resistance. Our findings provide new information to guide
the development of targeted therapeutic combinations for
treatment of invasive castration-resistant PCa.

RESULTS
Expression of AR-V7 and PIP5K1α in primary
PCa and in PCa metastatic specimens
To evaluate clinical importance of AR-V7 and its
correlation with PIP5K1α expression in PCa patients,
the first sets of tissue microarrays (TMAs) consisting of
begin prostate hyperplasia (BPH) (n=48), primary PCa
(n=65), and PCa metastatic tissues (n=43) were immunostained with antibodies against AR-V7 and PIP5K1α. A
second TMA that contained biopsies of BPH and cancer
tissues from 48 PCa patients was also examined for ARV7 and PIP5K1α expression. AR-V7 expression was
predominantly nuclear, whereas PIP5K1α expression was
present in both cytoplasm and nucleus of cancer cells
(Figure 1a and b). PIP5K1α expression was increased in
tumors with high level of AR-V7 compared with that of
tumors with lower AR-V7 expression (p=0.045, Figure
1c). Metastatic lesions in lymph nodes, lungs and bones
displayed increased PIP5K1α compared with that of
primary PCa (p=0.014; Figure 1d and e). Similarly, ARV7 expression was also significantly higher in metastasis
tissues compared with that in primary PCa (p<0.001,
Figure 1f and g). Thus, elevated level of AR-V7 positively
correlates with the increased PIP5K1α expression in
primary PCa tissues. A trend of the correlation between
AR-V7 and PIP5K1α was also observed in metastatic
tissues (p=0.056, Figure 1h). We next examined PIP5K1A
expression in AR-V7 positive or negative primary PCa
tissues (n=333) using the National Cancer Institute
database [25]. Although there was no statistically
significant correlation between AR-V7 and PIP5K1A
mRNA expression in primary PCa of this patient cohort,
we observed that PTEN expression was decreased in
tumors with higher PIP5K1A as compared to those with
lower PIP5K1A (p=0.011, Figure 1i). Similarly, PTEN
expression was significantly decreased in AR-V7-positive
tumors as compared to that in AR-V7-negative tumors (p=
0.023, Figure 1j). These data suggest that expression of
AR-V7 and PIP5K1A correlates with PTEN-status in PCa
patients.

Elevated expression of AR-V7 contributes to
increased PIP5K1α and tumor progression

growth of PCa and induces expression of PIP5K1α in the
nucleus. This suggests a mechanistic link between AR-V7,
PIP5K1α and PCa progression.

We further characterized the biological
consequences of AR-V7 overexpression in PCa cells and
the underlying molecular mechanisms. We introduced
overexpression of AR-V7 by transfecting non-malignant
PNT1A cells, which do not express endogenous AR-V7,
with pEGFP-AR-V7 or pEGFP control vectors. Expression
of AR-V7 led to an increase in PIP5K1α expression in
PNT1A cells, as measured by densitometric quantification
of the blots from three independent experiments using
Image J (for AR-V7 overexpression, p<0.001; for
PIP5K1α, p=0.006, Figure 2a and b). This coincided with
the increased proliferative activity of PNT1A cells that
expressed AR-V7 vector as compared to the cells that
expressed control vector (p=0.002, Figure 2c).
Since 22Rv1 cells represent a cellular model of
AR-V7 expressing CRPC[14], we therefore examined the
effect of elevated expression of AR-V7 on PIP5K1α in
malignant 22Rv1 cells, which harbor AR-V7 and display
robust growth under castration condition. Consistent with
the results observed in PNT1A cells, overexpression of
AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells significantly increased PIP5K1α
expression (For AR-V7 overexpression, p<0.001; for
PIP5K1α, p=0.041, Figure 2d), also led to a significant
increase in the levels of cyclin E (p<0.001) and cyclin
A2 (p<0.002), both key determinants of cell proliferation
(Figure 2e).
We further assessed whether 22Rv1 cells
overexpressing AR-V7 may have gained invasive feature
by using in vivo xenograft mouse model. To this end,
22Rv1 cells expressing AR-V7 or control vector were
implanted subcutaneously into the nude mice. Multiple
tumors were observed in all xenograft mice received
22Rv1 cells overexpressing AR-V7. The mean tumor
volume overexpressing AR-V7 was significantly increase
by 78% as compared with the controls (mean volume for
pEGFP-control tumors =76.15 mm3, mean volume for
pEGFP-AR-V7 tumors, the largest one among multiple
tumors=136.02 mm3, difference=59.87 mm3; 95%
CI=96.32-175.73; n=6 mice per group, p=0.02, Figure
2f). Thus, 22Rv1 cells overexpressing AR-V7 gained
increased ability to grow into multiple tumors as compared
with the controls. Immuno-histochemical analysis of
the xenograft tumors revealed a remarkable increase in
nuclear AR-V7 expression in tumors derived from 22Rv1
cells expressing AR-V7 (Figure 2g). Tumors derived from
AR-V7-expressing cells also displayed higher proliferative
activity, as measured by Ki67-staining (p < 0.001), and
showed enhanced nuclear PIP5K1α expression (Figure
2h and 2i). The matrix metalloproteinase (MMP9), a key
factor that promotes tumor metastasis, was significantly
higher in tumors derived from AR-V7-expressing cells
than in the controls as determined by immunoblot analysis
(p=0.012, Figure 2j). Taken together, AR-V7 promotes

Tumor Growth in Xenograft Mouse Models

Given the mechanistic link we have established
between AR-V7 and PIP5K1α, we therefore hypothesized
that AR-V7 cooperates with PIP5K1α to contribute to
tumor growth, thus treatment of tumors overexpressing
AR-V7 with ISA-2011B, a selective PIP5K1α inhibitor
may suppress the tumor growth through blocking the
deregulated AR-V7 pathways. To investigate this, we
established 22Rv1 tumors overexpressing AR-V7 in
mice, and then treated these mice bearing AR-V7overexpressing tumors (100-150 mm3 in mean volumes)
with ISA-2011B or vehicle control. After two weeks of
treatment, the mean tumor volumes in mice treated with
ISA-2011B was 3.5-fold smaller compared with those
treated with vehicle control (mean volume of tumors
for vehicle-treated controls = 844.12 mm3, and for ISA2011B-treated = 243.77 mm3, difference = 600.35 mm3;
95% CI=96.09-391.44; p=0.014, Figure 3a). We next
examined the effect of ISA-2011B-treatment on AR-V7
and the key factors that promote tumor invasiveness in
the xenograft tumors. Remarkably, AR-V7 expression in
tumors from the ISA-2011B-treated group was decreased
by 93% compared to the vehicle-treated controls (p=0.002,
Figure 3b), and a significant decrease in MMP9 expression
was also observed as determined by immunoblot analysis
(p=0.018, Figure 3c). Immunohistochemical analysis
further revealed a reduction in AR-V7 expression in both
nucleus and cytoplasm of the tumor cells (Figure 3d).
Similarly, both nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of
CDK1 was also decreased in ISA-2011B-treted tumors
as compared with the controls (Figure 3e). ISA-2011Btreatment also led to an inhibition in the expression of
vimentin, a bio-marker for metastatic tumors, in the
infiltrating tumor cells at the invasive front (Figure 3f).
Thus, inhibition of PIP5K1α suppresses the growth and
invasiveness of AR-V7-overexpressing tumors.

Association of AR-V7, PIP5K1α and CDK1 in
subcellular compartments
The above results suggest that AR-V7, PIP5K1α
and CDK1 may cooperatively promote tumor progression.
Immunoprecipitation assays of the nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions of 22Rv1 cells further revealed that
AR-V7 formed complexes with PIP5K1α in the nucleus
and cytoplasmic compartments (Figure 4a). PIP5K1α in
turn also formed complexes with CDK1 and AR in both
nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of 22Rv1 cells
(Figure 4a). Thus, AR-V7 may physically interact with

PIP5K1α, and CDK1 through formation of protein-protein
complexes. Since AR-V7 forms proteins complexes with
PIP5K1α, we next investigated whether a decrease in ARV7 expression induced by ISA-2011B might be a result
of disruption of AR-V7/PIP5K1α complexes. To this
end, we treated 22Rv1 cells with ISA-2011B, MG132,
a proteasome inhibitor alone or a combination of ISA2011B and MG132 together. Expression of PIP5K1α
was remarkably increased in 22Rv1 cells treated with
MG132 (Figure 4b), suggesting that MG132 prevented
proteasome-dependent degradation of PIP5K1α. ISA2011B was unable to inhibit PIP5K1α expression in the
presence MG132 (Figure 4b). This suggests that ISA2011B inhibits PIP5K1α expression by disrupting its
protein stabilization. Interestingly, MG132 treatment
had no effect on AR-V7 protein stability, however, in the
presence of MG132, ISA-2011B was unable to supress
AR-V7 expression (Figure 4b). MG132 did not appear
to have pronounced effect on protein stabilization of fulllength AR or CDK1 expression (Figure 4b). Thus, ISA2011B disrupts stabilization of PIP5K1α and AR-V7/
PIP5K1α complexes, leading to a decrease in AR-V7
protein expression. This data suggests that ISA-2011Binduced effect on AR-V7 is specifically dependent on
PIP5K1α-associated pathways. Next, we examined the
effect of ISA-2011B on the expression and subcellular
distribution of AR-V7, PIP5K1α, CDK1 and AR in
22Rv1 cells. Inhibition of PIP5K1α by ISA-2011B led
to a remarkable reduction in AR-V7 and CDK1 in both
nucleus and cytoplasm of 22Rv1 cells (Figure 4c, d and
e). ISA-2011B treatment also abolished AR expression
in the nucleus, without depleting the cytoplasmic AR
(Figure 4c). It has been shown that CDK1 is able to
phosphorylate AR and is believed to activate AR activity
during progression of castration resistant PCa[24]. To
define the functional link between CDK1 and AR-V7,
we examined effect of inhibition of CDK1 on AR-V7.
Inhibition of CDK1 via siRNA-mediated knockdown
led to a remarkable reduction in AR-V7 expression and
a concomitant decrease in PIP5K1α expression in 22Rv1
cells (Figure 4f). Similarly, inhibition of PIP5K1α by
ISA-2011B significantly decreased CDK1 (p<0.001,
Figure 4g) and AR-V7 in 22Rv1 cells (p<0.001, Figure
4h), while blocking AR signaling using enzalutamide had
no inhibitory effect on CDK1 and AR-V7 (Figure 4g and
h). Taken together, the above findings suggest that AR-V7
interacts with PIP5K1α and CDK1. Further, abnormal ARV7 expression may be effectively inhibited by selectively
blocking PIP5K1α using its inhibitor ISA-2011B.

PIP5K1α and AR-V7 were highly expressed in metastatic
tissues from PCa patients. We therefore examined
whether ISA-2011B might effectively induce apoptosis
by specifically blocking PIP5K1α/AR-V7/CDK1 in
PIP5K1α-overexpressing PCa cells. We introduced
overexpression of PIP5K1α by transfecting of 22Rv1 cells
with pLPS-EGFP-PIP5K1α or pLPS-EGFP control vector,
followed by the treatment of the transfected cells with ISA2011B or vehicle control. As expected, ISA-2011B was
effective on both 22Rv1 cells overexpressing PIP5K1α
(p<0.001) and control cells (p=0.001), and showed more
pronounced inhibitory effect on cells overexpressing
PIP5K1α (Figure 5a). ISA-2011B treatment led to a
significant decrease in AR-V7 expression in both 22Rv1
cells overexpressing PIP5K1α (p<0.001) and control cells
(p=0.001, Figure 5b). Overexpression of PIP5K1α greatly
increased expression of CDK1 and PSA, while ISA2011B treatment diminished CDK1 and PSA expression in
PIP5K1α-overexpressing and control cells (Figure 5c and
d). The inhibitory effect of ISA-2011B on AR-V7, CDK1
and PSA was co-incident with a significant induction in

cells overexpressing PIP5K1α (p=0.0085) and in controls
(p=0.0043, Figure 5e).

The additive effect of combined treatment of
22Rv1 cells with ISA-2011B and enzalutamide
Enzalutamide targets ligand-binding domain of AR,
therefore inhibits AR activity. However, enzalutamide
has no inhibitory effect on AR-V7 in castration-resistant
22Rv1 cells [14]. In contrast to enzalutamide, ISA-2011B
treatment significantly reduces AR-V7 expression in in
vitro and in vivo PCa models as mentioned above. To
test the therapeutic potentials of combination therapies
of ISA-2011B and enzalutamide, we treated 22Rv1
cells overexpressing PIP5K1α or control vector with
enzalutmide, ISA-2011B, or combination of enzalutamide
and ISA-2011B. As expected, ISA-2011B treatment alone
readily reduced expression of PIP5K1α, AR-V7, CDK1
and PSA (Figure 6a, b c and d). However, the inhibitory
effect of a combination of ISA-2011B and enzalutamide on
PIP5K1α and AR-V7 expression was significantly greater
than that for ISA-2011B alone (for PIP5K1α, p=0.007; for
AR-V7, p=0.07, Figure 6b and c). Immunofluorescence
analysis was performed to visualize the treatment effect
on AR expression. Enzalutamide greatly reduced the
cytoplasmic AR, whereas ISA-2011B decreased the
nuclear AR in 22Rv1 cells. As expected, a combination
of enzalutamide and ISA-2011B abolished both nuclear
and cytoplasmic AR expression in 22Rv1 cells, showing a
greater effect than the single agent (Figure 6e). These data
suggest that combination treatment using enzalutamide
and ISA-2011B has an additive effect and completely
inhibits deregulated AR and AR-V7 mediated pathways.

Treatment of 22Rv1cells with ISA-2011B reduces

in AR-V7-expressing PC3 cells. ISA-2011B and the
combination of ISA-2011B and enzalutamide greatly
inhibited PIP5K1α, pAKTS473 and CDK1 in AR-V7expressing PC3 cells (Figure 7a and b). As expected,
enzalutamide had no inhibitory effect on these proteins
(Figure 7a and b). Immunofluorescence analysis indicated
that ISA-2011B alone effectively reduced pAKTS473
levels in AR-V7-expressing PC3 cells (Figure 7c). ISA2011B treatment effectively diminished the expression
of AR-V7 in both nucleus and cytoplasm of PC3 cells
(Figure 7c and d). We did not observe a statistically
significant difference in pAKTS473 or AR-V7 inhibitions
between the combination of ISA-2011B and enzalutamide
as compared to ISA-2011B alone in AR-V7-expressing
PC3 cells (Figure 7a and b). Thus, ISA-2011B alone is
sufficient to inhibit AR-V7 and pAKT in PTEN- and
AR-negative PCa cells expressing elevated AR-V7 and
pAKTS473.

PIP5K1α acts upstream of PI3K/AKT pathways, and
PTEN status is essential for controlling the proper activity
of AKT[17]. We therefore next examined the functional
relationship between ARV-7 and PIP5K1α in PCa cells
lacking functional PTEN. To this end, PC-3 cells that
do not express PTEN or AR, but express elevated level
of pAKTS473, were transfected with pEGFP-AR-V7
or control vector. Aberrant AR-V7 expression led to
an increase in PIP5K1α and a concomitant increase in
pAKTS473 expression, as well as CDK1 on immunoblot
analysis (Figure 7a and b). Immunoblot analysis was
performed to assess the effect of enzalutamide, ISA2011B, or a combination of ISA-2011B and enzalutamide
on the expression of PIP5K1α, pAKTS473 and CDK1

We next wanted to further study the relationship
between AR and PIP5K1α/CDK1, and thereby gain
a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms
underlying the action of ISA-2011B on AR and ARV7. We introduced AR expression by transfecting PC3
cells with pCMV-AR or pCMV control vectors, and
subsequently treated AR-expressing PC3 cells with ISA2011B, enzalutamide, or combination of ISA-2011B and
enzalutamide. ISA-2011B and a combination of ISA2011B and enzalutamide had pronounced inhibitory effect

on PIP5K1α-associated PI3K/AKT and AR signaling
complexes by using PTEN-negative PCa cells expressing
functional AR. We compared the effect of ISA-2011B with
LY294002, an inhibitor of PI3K/AKT in PTEN-negative
LNCaP cells containing functional AR, but expressing
elevated pAKTS473. We treated LNCaP cells with ISA2011B, LY294002 or a combination of ISA-2011B and
LY294002. ISA-2011B or LY294002 treatment led greatly
inhibited pAKTS473 and cyclin D1 expression (Figure
7h, i and j). A combination of ISA-2011B and LY294002
showed a greater effect, as compared to the single agent,
to inhibit pAKTS473 and cyclin D1 expression in LNCaP
cells (Figure 7h and i). This suggests that the action of
ISA-2011B on PI3K/AKT pathways is similar to that of

LY294002. However, in striking contrast to LY294002,
ISA-2011B was able to inhibit AR and PSA expression,
while LY294002 did not show any effect on AR or PSA
expression (Figure 7j). A combination of ISA-2011B
and LY294002 showed similar inhibitory effects as ISA2011B alone on AR and PSA (Figure 7j), suggesting that
LY294002 did not interfere with or augment ISA-2011B.
In addition, LY294002 treatment reduced p27 expression,
whereas ISA-2011B showed the opposite effect and
increased expression of p27, a key cell cycle inhibitor to
inhibit abnormal proliferation (Figure 7h). The effect of
ISA-2011B on PIP5K1α-associated PI3K/AKT and AR
signaling complexes was co-incident its action to induce
apoptosis as measured by the induction of caspase-3

Figure 8: A schematic model shows that PIP5K1α acts on two parallel signaling pathways. The model depicts PIP5K1α

acts on two parallel pathways. PIP5K1α is the key kinase responsible for generation of PIP2. In turns, PIP2 serves as a precursor molecule
required for PI3K activity and generation of PIP3, thus PIP5K1α acts upstream of PI3K/AKT as illustrated in our previous reported studies
(Semenas et al., 2014) and the data presented in this study. Here we revealed a new mechanism by which AR-V7 cooperates with PIP5K1α
and CDK1 to promote growth and invasion of PCa cells. AR-V7 physically interacts with PIP5K1α and CDK1 predominantly in the nucleus
through formation of protein complexes. In PCa cells with PTEN mutations, AR-V7 is able to increase activity of pAKT. ISA-2011B blocks
deregulated PIP5K1α/AKT activity and disrupt AR-V7/CDK1/PIP5K1α complexes in the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartment of PTENnegative cells. The effect of ISA-2011B on AR may be mediated through CDK1, which is an upstream regulator and co-factor of both AR
and AR-V7. The combination of ISA-2011B and enzalutamide synergistically inhibits deregulated AR and AR-V7 pathways in PCa cells.

acts as PI3K/AKT inhibitor similar to LY294002, but
also has distinct role act as inhibitor of AR signaling
complexes.

shown in our previous reported study, PIP5K1α promotes
invasiveness of PCa cells that lacks functional PTEN and
AR-V715. In the absence of functional PTEN, PIP5K1α
induces elevated activation of AKT and promotes PC3
tumor growth in xenograft mice [15]. In the present study,
we further show that the effect of ISA-2011B on PI3K/
AKT cascades is comparable to that of LY294002, an
inhibitor of PI3K/AKT in PTEN-negative LNCaP cells.
In contrast to LY294002 that is un-related to AR signaling,
ISA-2011B has a strong inhibitory effect on AR-V7 and
AR. We further show that the inhibitory effect of ISA2011B on AR-V7 or AR is also in part dependent on
CDK1, and this finding is in agreement with the previous
reported study [15]. Thus, ISA-2011B has a potential
therapeutic value for treatment of PCa harboring AR-V7related resistance to anti-androgen therapy.
In the present study, we demonstrate that
combination of ISA-2011B and enzalutmide have additive
inhibitory effects on AR signalling in PCa. The secondgeneration anti-androgen enzalutamide represents an
improvement in therapy options for late stage metastatic
CRPC, however enzalutamide-treated PCa cells rapidly
develops treatment resistance, most likely attributed
to the constitutively active AR-V7 [11, 25]. Here, we
show that treatment of PCa cells with enzalutamide
diminishes cytoplasmic AR in 22Rv1 cells, suggesting that
enzalutamide impairs agonist binding whereas ISA-2011B
eliminates the nuclear AR expression, through PIP5K1α
and CDK1. As AR interacts with PIP5K1α and CDK1,
its activity in the nucleus is likely dependent in part on
PIP5K1α and CDK1 [15]. The combination of ISA-2011B
and enzalutamide synergistically inhibits deregulated
AR and AR-V7 pathways in PCa cells. Our data suggest
a compelling mechanism to circumvent enzalutamide
treatment.
Taken together, our study identifies novel
cooperative mechanisms involving PIP5K1α, AR-V7,
CDK1 and AR, which drive tumor progression and
contribute to enzalutamide resistance. Our study suggests
that ISA-2011B and enzalutamide together can suppress
tumor progression and metastasis through specifically
blocking multiple pathways including deregulated
AR pathways and elevated level of AR-V7 signaling
complexes. Our findings provide new insights into the
targeted therapeutic approaches to overcome resistance of
PCa to enzalutamide treatment.

DISCUSSION
Increasing evidence suggests that AR-V7 is
involved in development of CRPC, bone metastasis
and resistance to enzalutamide[5, 7, 8]. However, the
precise mechanisms and co-factors of AR-V7 that act
cooperatively to promote progression of CRPC are
largely unknown. Further, no therapeutic compounds are
currently available for treatment of patients with PCa
resistance to enzalutamide. In the present study, we show
that AR-V7 is highly expressed in metastatic tissues from
PCa patients and its expression correlates with elevated
level of PIP5K1α expression in tumor tissues from PCa
patients. We further demonstrate that overexpression of
AR-V7 promotes growth and invasiveness of castrationresistant 22Rv1 tumors in xenograft mice. Overexpression
of AR-V7 significantly induces cyclin A2, cyclin E and
MMP9 expression, suggesting that PIP5K1α/AR-V7 may
act on these target genes, which are in accordance with
their action on promoting growth and invasiveness of
PCa in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide evidence
suggesting that AR-V7 is functionally associated with
PIP5K1α.
In the present study, we show that AR-V7
physically interacts with PIP5K1α through formation
of protein-protein complexes. We treated 22Rv1 cells
with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 to prevent proteins
from degradation by proteasome-mediated pathways.
PIP5K1α protein, but not AR-V7 is no longer degraded
in the presence of MG132, suggesting that PIP5K1α
protein stabilization is regulated by proteasome-dependent
pathways. In the presence of MG132, ISA-2011B was
unable to inhibit either PIP5K1α or AR-V7. Our finding
suggests that the stability of AR-V7 protein is dependent
on its complex-formation with PIP5K1α. Thus, the
decrease in AR-V7 expression observed in ISA-2011Btreated cells is a result of disruption of stabilization of
PIP5K1α/AR-V7 complexes (Figure 8). The precise
molecular and cellular mechanisms involving the interplay
among AR-V7, PIP5K1α and their functional targets will
require further investigation.
In the present study, we show that ISA-2011B
significantly suppresses growth of castration-resistant
22Rv1 tumors overexpressing AR-V7 in xenograft mice.
Our data provide evidence suggesting that the effect of
ISA-2011B on growth of 22Rv1 tumors is specific,
and ISA-2011B acts on disruption of PIP5K1α/AR-V7
complexes, leading to degradation of AR-V7. In addition
to its role as a potential co-factor to AR-V7 through
complex-formation, PIP5K1α has a major role as a lipid
kinase, and acts on PI3K/AKT/PTEN pathways [16]. As

Knockdowns
pLPS3-EGFP vector containing full-length human
PIP5K1α cDNA or control empty vector were used as
previously described [15]. pEGFP vector containing fulllength AR-V7 and pEGFP vector were used as previously
described [7]. pCMV-AR containing full-length AR
and pCMV control vectors were kindly provided by
Dr. Yvonne Giwercman at Department of Translational
Medicine, Lund University, Sweden. Transient transfection
was performed using Lipofectamine® 2000 transfection
reagent (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. SiRNAs against CDK1
or siRNA negative control duplex were purchased (VWR
International Inc. Stockholm). SiRNAs (50nM) were
transfected into 1 x 105 PCa cells using Transfection
Reagent TransIT-TKO® according to manufacturers’
protocol (Mirus Bio LCC). After introduction of respective
siRNA complexes into PCa cells, cells were then collected
after 24, 48 and 72 hours post-transfection.

Immunohistochemical Analysis
Immunohistochemistry on tumor tissue microarrays
was performed as previously described [27]. The staining
procedure was performed using a semiautomatic staining
machine (Ventana ES, Ventana Inc., Tucson, AZ). The
sections were viewed under an Olympus BX51 microscope
at magnification of 20X or 40X. Microphotographs were
taken by using a high resolution scanner (ScanscopeCS,
Aperio, Vista, CA). The specimens were evaluated and
scored by four different scientists, including a pathologist.
The staining intensity was scored as 0 (negative), 1
(weakly positive), 2 (moderate positive), 3 (strongly or
very strongly positive) using an arbitrary semi-quantitative
scale. The Gleason score 6 was used as cut off to define
low vs. high grade.

Mouse Models of Human Xenograft Tumors and

All animal studies were approved by the Swedish
Regional Ethical Animal Welfare Committee. Athymic
NMRI nude male mice (n=6 per experiment group) aged
8–12 weeks and weighing 25-27 grams each (Taconic
Europe, Lille Skensved, Denmark) were used in each
experimental setting. 2x106 cells/mouse in 100 µl sterile
vehicle solution were implanted subcutaneously into the
flank. Tumor diameters were measured using calipers, and
volumes were calculated using the equation (a x b2/2),
where a and b represent the larger and smaller diameters,
respectively. Tumors were grown to mean volume of 100150 mm3. Xenograft mice with tumors were randomized
(n=6 mice per group) and treatment of xenograft mice
with vehicle control, ISA-2011B (40 mg/Kg) was initiated,
and treatment for every second day was lasted for 15 days.
The weights of mice were measured regularly and survival
followed. Tumor samples were collected post-mortem
and used for immunoblotting and immuno-histochemical
analyses.

Cell Culturing and Treatments
