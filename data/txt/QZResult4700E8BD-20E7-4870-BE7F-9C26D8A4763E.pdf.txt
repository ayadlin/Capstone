ABSTRACT
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients show high relapse rates and some develop
conventional chemotherapy resistance. Leukemia Stem Cells (LSCs) are the main
player for AML relapses and drug resistance. LSCs might rely on the B-cell-specific
Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site-1 (BMI-1) in promoting cellular
proliferation and survival. Growth of LSCs in microenvironments that are deprived of
nutrients leads to up-regulation of the signaling pathways during the progression of
the disease, which may illustrate the sensitivity of LSCs to inhibitors of those signaling
pathways as compared to normal cells. We analyzed the expression of LSC markers
(CD34, CLL-1, TIM-3 and BMI-1) using quantitative RT-PCR in bone marrow samples of
40 AML patients of different FAB types (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, and M7). We also studied
the expression of these markers in 2 AML cell lines (Kasumi-1 and KG-1a) using flow
cytometry and quantitative RT-PCR. The overexpression of TIM-3, CLL-1, and BMI-1
was markedly correlated with poor prognosis in these patients. Our in vitro findings
demonstrate that targeting BMI-1, which markedly increased in the leukemic cells,
was associated with marked decrease in leukemic burden. This study also presents
results for blocking LSCs’ surface markers CD44, CLL-1, and TIM-3. These markers
may play an important role in elimination of AML. Our study indicates a correlation
between the expression of markers TIM-3, CLL-1, and especially of BMI-1 and the
aggressiveness of AML and thus the potential impact of prognosis and therapies that
target LSCs on improving the cure rates.

INTRODUCTION

without any damage to the normal hematopoietic stem
cells (HSCs) [3].
It was reported that LSCs were present within the
CD34+/CD38- clone because of the ability to establish
human AML in a xenograft model [4]. Several surface
markers reported to be expressed on the LSCs’ surface
are antigens such as CD33 [5], CD123 [6], CLL-1 [7],
CD44 [8], CD47 [9], and recently TIM-3 [10]. On the
other hand, the B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia
virus integration site-1 (BMI-1 gene) is a member of the
polycomb group genes family [11]. The polycomb group
gene BMI-1 participates in the growth and regulation of
cell proliferation of both normal and LSCs [12].
In 2010, there were more than 12,000 new cases of
AML in the United States (0.8% of all new cancer cases
and 29% of all leukemia cases) [13], and early death

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a hematological
disease characterized by specific clinical and molecular
heterogeneous disorders. AML is associated with poor
long-term survival, even with newer chemotherapeutic
agents. Various studies reported that AML relapse and
resistance to chemotherapies may originate from a small
clone, known as Leukemic Stem Cells (LSCs) [1]. LSCs
are identified as a chemo-resistant clone that has the ability
for limitless self-renewal and also production of a large
number of blast cells [2]. The identification and targeting
of LSCs is the hope for improvement of long-term survival
for AML patients [3]. Therefore, it is necessary to identify
signaling pathways and surface and molecular markers
that are specific to the LSCs in order to eliminate them

(within two months after diagnosis) was observed in
52.7% of older AML patients [14]. There is no recent data
about the incidence of all leukemia in Egypt, but the U.S.
National Cancer Institute (NCI) has reported that between
1999 and 2001 the incidence of all leukemia in Egypt was
6.0 per 100,000, while the incidence of AML was 1.1 per
100,000 [15]. Although over the last few decades there
has been some improvement in survival for AML patients,
mainly in younger age groups, AML long-term survival is
still a big challenge [13].
This study was designed to investigate markers such
as CD34, CD44, CLL-1, TIM-3 and BMI-1 expression
in samples from myeloid leukemia patients and whether
they might serve as biomarkers to predict disease
aggressiveness. We also studied the effect of targeting
these markers on the leukemic clone proliferation and
survival.

AML FAB M4 and M2 were associated with mild increase
(2.7 and 3.5 fold, respectively), which was associated with
better prognosis.

In vitro study
The flow cytometry stem cell marker assay for the
Kasumi-1 and KG-1a cell lines was performed to study
the expression of CD34, CD38, CD44, TIM-3, CLL-1
and BMI-1 (Supplementary Data, Table S1). Kasumi-1
cell line showed a positive shift for CD34 (63%) and
CD38 (4.1%), with a double expression (1.6%). TIM-3
expression was 16% and had double expression with
CD34 (9.3%). CLL-1 expression was 8.4% and had
double expression with CD34 (4.2 %) (Supplementary
Data, Figure S1). For the KG-1a cell line, almost all cells
expressed CD34 (98%) and CD38 (26%), with a double
expression (25%). TIM-3 expression was (1.3%), with
double expression with CD34 (1.2 %). CLL-1 expression
was 4%, and double expression with CD34 was about 3.7 %
(Supplementary Data, Figure  S2). Expression of CD44
and BMI-1 in both cell lines was more than 90%. About
61% of Kasumi-1 cells had double expression of CD34
and CD44, while almost all CD44 positive KG-1a cells
also expressed CD34.

RESULTS
Patients’ assessment for LSCs markers
Gene expression analysis was done with qRT-PCR
technique. We found expression of CD34, CLL-1, BMI-1
and TIM-3 was increased in all AML groups except
M3. CD34 expression increased in comparison to the
control group (3.4–4.3 fold), with no specific correlation
to any French-American-British (FAB) classification
(Figure 1A). CLL-1 showed high expression in M1, M4,
M5, and M7 groups (3.5–6 fold), while the expression
in M2 group was less (2.5 fold) compared to the control
group (Figure 1B).
BMI-1 was found to be highly expressed compared
to control in M1 (13.2 fold), M5 (17.5 fold), and to a lesser
extent in M7 (4.3 fold), and only 2.3–3.5 fold increase in
M2, M3, and M4 groups (Figure 1C). The high expression
of BMI-1 in M1, M5, and M7 groups was confirmed by
Western blot technique (data not shown).
The expression of TIM-3 showed marked statistical
significance in M1 and M4 groups (12.7 and 4.6 fold,
respectively), and less in M2, M5 and M7 groups (2.2–2.9
fold) (Figure 1D).
For patient outcomes, the LSCs markers, especially
BMI-1, were significantly high in 12 patients (M1, M5,
and M7); 8 died, 2 relapsed, 1 did not come back to
follow up, and only 1 patient showed complete remission.
Twenty-eight patients (M2, M3, and M4) associated with
mild to moderate increase in expression of LSC markers;
6 died, 4 relapsed, 8 did not come back to follow up, 1
showed resistance to chemotherapy, and 9 had complete
remission. The overall survival for our AML patients
indicates that patients with low gene expression had longer
survival time than those with high expression (Figure 2).
BMI-1 and CLL-1 expressions were significantly
increased in patients with AML FAB M5 (17 fold), which
was associated with the worst prognosis. Patients with

Cell vitality assay
We used the same AML cell lines to assay the
effect of targeting of certain surface molecules (with
monoclonal antibodies) and intracellular molecules (with
small molecule inhibitors) on the cell proliferation and
also to find the optimal concentration. Assessment for cell
proliferation before running MTT assay was important to
determine the appropriate cell count and duplication time
for each cell line. The appropriate cell count for both cell
lines was 50–100 × 106/ well. Kasumi-1 cells’ duplication
time was about 72 hours while KG-1a was 48 hours. We
used different concentrations to determine the appropriate
concentration that would interfere with cell proliferation.
For Kasumi-1 cells the 72 hour assay showed that
the lowest concentration of anti-CD44 (1 µg/100  µl)
was associated with a 50% decrease in proliferation
(p  <  0.001), anti-CD34 (1 µg/100 µl) with a decrease
of about 40% (p < 0.001), and anti-CLL-1 (1, 0.5,
0.05 µg/100 µl) with about 24% decrease, all compared
to control. The best result was obtained with anti-TIM-3
(0.5 µg/100 µl), which decreased proliferation by about
49% (p < 0.001) compared to control (Figure 3A). BMI-1
small molecule inhibitor PTC-209 at 2 µM was found to
be the best concentration; it decreased proliferation by
about 70% (p < 0.001) compared to control (Figure 3B).
For the KG-1a cell line, the 48 hour assay showed
that the lowest concentration of anti-CD44 and anti-CD34
(1 µg/100 µl) decreased cell proliferation by about 55%
and 39%, respectively, compared to control (p < 0.001).

Known LSCs markers

Anti-CLL-1 (0.5 µg/100 µl) was associated with a
smaller decrease in proliferation (30%). The best result
was obtained with anti-TIM-3 (0.5 µg/100 µl), which
decreased proliferation by about 35% compared to control
(p < 0.001) (Figure 4A). The BMI-1 small molecule
inhibitor PTC-209 at 4 µM decreased cell proliferation
by 41% compared to control (p < 0.001), and at 2 µM
it decreased the cell proliferation by 28% (p < 0.001)
(Figure 4B).
Association of anti-CLL-1 and anti-TIM-3 didn’t
show any synergism effect in either Kasumi-1 (Figure 5A)
or KG-1a cell lines (Figure 5B).

CD34
CD34, a stem cell marker, is expressed by blast
cells only for some AML patients. It is controversial
as to whether CD34 expression (defined as at least
10–20% positive cells) has any prognostic value in AML
patients who receive intensive chemotherapy [16]. Some
previous studies suggested that CD34 expression is always
associated with multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein
overexpression, which may explain the poor response
to treatment. However, the relation between the
overexpression of multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein
and CD34, as well as the relation between the expression
of multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein and the poor
prognosis, needs further assessment [17].
Our present results evaluating the expression and
prognostic effect of CD34 were conflicting because there
was heterogeneity in gene expression profiles among
AML patients. CD34 increased in almost all patients with
no specific correlation to a certain FAB group. The most
commonly used systems to classify AML into subtypes is
the French-American-British (FAB) classification and the
newer World Health Organization (WHO) classification.

DISCUSSION
For this study of the gene expression of both wellknown and lesser known LSC molecules, we preferred
to use bone marrow samples because they are more
representative and richer in stem cells in comparison to
peripheral blood. We chose to use Kasumi-1 and KG-1a cell
lines because these cells do not spontaneously differentiate
to granulocyte and eosinophilic-like cells and do not
respond to colony stimulating factor (Supplementary Data,
Figure S3).

CD44

The FAB system is useful and still widely used in the
clinical field, especially in our country (Egypt) [18].
Only the M3 group showed CD34 expression close to the
control group. Oyan et al. reported the same results when
they tried to find the relation between CD34 expression
and prognosis in AML patients [16]. We suggest that
CD34 may play an important role in cell survival and
maturation because CD34 expressed mainly on progenitors
cells and disappeared with cell maturation. Our data
showed a marked decrease in Kasumi-1 and KG-1a
cell proliferations even at the lowest concentrations of
anti-CD34, which is consistent with the role of CD34 in
cell survival and the differentiation process.

CD44 is known to play an important role in
hematopoiesis including cell migration, proliferation,
differentiation, and survival of hematopoietic stem/
progenitor cells. LSCs were known to be associated with
CD44 overexpression in comparison to normal HSCs
[19]. Our work shows the high expression of CD44 on
both cell lines with the dramatic effect of blocking mAbs,
suggesting the multi-functionality of CD44  not only
on homing and engraftment but also in cell proliferation
and signaling for  cell survival. Consistent with our
findings, Hertweck et al. reported that CD44, through

survival time than those with high expression. For Kaplan-Meier plots, the log-rank test was applied. The log-rank test p value indicates
the significance of the correlation.

complex intracellular signaling cascades including the
PI3K/Akt and the Ras/ERK pathway, mediates CD44regulated adhesion, migration, proliferation, survival, and
apoptosis [20]. Jin et al. reported the important role of
CD44 in homing and engraftment of LSCs in the bone
marrow niche [8]. They used H90 mAbs to demonstrate
the effect of targeting of CD44 on homing and engraftment
of leukemic cells in bone marrow. Lapidot and colleagues
showed that crosstalk exists between the CXCR4–SDF-1
axis and CD44 in normal hematopoietic cells and also that
the use of specific antibodies disrupting those interactions
blocked AML cell homing [21].

for LSCs, expressed in more than 87% of AML patients,
with weak expression in normal hematopoietic cells
[23]. For AML, both blast cells and LSCs express CLL-1
(86.5% vs. 54.5%, respectively) [22]. CLL-1 intracellular
domain consists of an immunotyrosine-based inhibition
motif and an YXXM motif, suggesting a role for CLL-1
as a signaling receptor. The immunotyrosine-based
inhibition motif containing receptors works as an inhibitor
for the active pathways via recruitment of the protein
tyrosine phosphatases SHIP, SHP-1, and SHP-2 [24].
On the other hand, the YXXM motif carries a
potential p85 subunit binding site (SH2 domain) of the
phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase, which has an important role
in cellular activation pathways [25]. The signal function of
CLL-1 depends on whether its ligand leads to activation of
YXXM motif or immunotyrosine-based inhibition motif,
which may depend on the level of phosphorylation of
both motifs as well as on the efficiency of recruitment of

CLL-1
CLL-1 is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and
member of the large family of C-type lectin-like receptors
involved in immune regulation [22]. It is a unique markers

SHP-1/2 and p85. Besides its role as a cellular activation
motif, the YXXM motif has been demonstrated to act as
an internalization motif [26, 27]. It might be responsible
for the demonstrated internalization of the CLL-1 receptor
upon antibody-mediated cross-linking. Furthermore, the
CLL-1 internalization upon ligand encounter may instead
act as a switch to terminate receptor-mediated signaling.
Bakker et al. described the pattern of expression
of CLL-1 in hematopoietic cells and found that the
expression of CLL-1 was in myeloid cells, as well as in
the majority of AML blasts [28]. A recent study indicated
that CLL-1 is also present on the majority of the CD34+/
CD38− compartment in AML but absent from CD34+/
CD38− cells in normal and in regenerating bone marrow
controls, which has an important role in discrimination
between leukemic and normal stem cells [7]. On the other
hand, anti-CLL-1 antibody was unlikely to have an antileukemic effect unlike the other mAbs because it had only
a very mild effect on cell proliferation in both cell lines as
found with our data. Consistent with our findings, work
by van Rhenen and colleagues showed that anti-CLL-1
mAbs did not influence engraftment of AML CD34+ cells
in NOD/SCID mice [7].

(N-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain, mucin
domain, transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tail).
The tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic tail are found
in a cluster, suggesting the function of TIM-3 as a signal
transduction in AML LSCs. TIM-3 is expressed in the
CD34+/CD38− AML LSC fraction and in the majority
of their downstream CD38+ leukemic progenitors in
most AML types except for M3 [29]. Thus, TIM-3 is
suggested to be one of the promising AML LSC surface
target molecules [10]. Recent studies demonstrated the
strong correlation between TIM-3 and galectin-9, which
is increased in AML patients in comparison to the normal
individual. Kikushige et al. reported that galectin-9 is
mainly released by the CD34+ fraction of AML cells
that contain LSCs. Binding of galectin-9 and TIM-3
will induce simultaneous activation of the NF-κB and
β-catenin signaling in leukemic cells, which in turn will
induce marked gene expression changes including upregulation of MCL-1, the important survival factor for
LSCs, enhancing the pro-survival axis (Figure 6). TIM3/galectin-9 signaling may also be critical for survival
of LSCs because it has been found that deprivation of
galectin-9 accelerates apoptosis of leukemic cells in
AML cell lines [30]. The increased concentration of
galectin-9 induced marked gene expression changes
including up-regulation of MCL-1. Galectin-9 produced
by the LSCs will bind and stimulate TIM-3-expressing
AML cells including LSCs (autocrine effect), supporting
their survival or leukemia progression [10]. TIM-3 also
is originally expressed on the CD4+ Th1 lymphocytes

of galectin-9 and TIM-3 will induce simultaneous activation of the NF-κB and β-catenin signaling in leukemic cells, which in turn will
induce marked gene expression changes including up-regulation of MCL-1, the important survival factor for LSCs, enhancing the prosurvival axis. Green arrows = activation. Abbreviations: β-cat, β-catenin; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; IκBα, inhibitor of κB; NF-κB,

Our data showed that BMI-1 was markedly
increased in M1, M5, and M7 groups, while the expression
was moderately increased in M2 and M4. The M3 group
showed mild increase in BMI-1 in comparison to the
control group and this may be related to the function of
BMI-1 as a transcription factor, so that it may be related
to increasing the cell division of the bone marrow cells.
Iwama et al. demonstrated that forced expression of
BMI-1 led to a marked expansion of both multi-potential
progenitors and HSCs in vivo [38]. They also showed that
the absence of BMI-1 is related to a profound defect in
HSCs' self-renewal [38].
The mechanism of action of small molecule
inhibitor PTC-209 is not clear yet, but it may interfere
with post-transcriptional regulation of BMI-1 [39].
The higher expression of BMI-1 in the Kasumi cell
line compared to KG-1a confirms the role of BMI-1 in
cell proliferation in leukemia and the possibility to use
BMI-1 as target for new strategies against AML. Kreso
and colleagues demonstrated that PTC-209 successfully
inhibited the endogenous BMI-1 expression in human
colorectal HCT116 and human fibrosarcoma HT1080
tumor cells [39]. The main problem is that BMI-1 is also
known to be essential for normal cell survival. So BMI-1
might need to be selectively targeted to the LSCs in order
to spare normal cells.

surface and also plays an important role in Th1 cell
immunity regulation and tolerance [31].
Kikushige and Miyamoto reported that TIM-3
expression increased in CD34+/CD38- LSCs and blast
cells in most AML patients, except for acute promyelocytic
leukemia (M3), normal HSCs, and normal progenitors
[10]. In testing the inhibitory effect of anti-TIM-3 mAbs
on proliferation of human AML in an in vitro system, we
found that anti-TIM-3 mAbs (0.5 µg/100 µl) was sufficient
to interfere with the leukemic cells’ proliferation, while
the other concentrations didn’t show a marked effect on
cell survival. These findings also suggest the function
of TIM-3 as a signal transduction in AML LSCs. On the
other hand, Kikushige and Miyamoto tested the effect
of anti-TIM-3 mAb (ATIK2a) in vivo. They used NOD/
SCID mice for this experiment to test the blocking effect
and to potentiate antibody-dependent-cell-cytotoxicity
of the mAbs. Inconsistent with our results, injection of
anti-TIM-3 mAbs did not affect reconstitution of normal
hematopoiesis, but it successfully interfered with the
proliferation of the human leukemic cells [10].

BMI-1
The epigenetic mechanisms are the main player for
self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. One of these
mechanisms is under the control of Polycomb-group
(PcG) proteins, which are involved in this process by
repressing the genes involved in cell proliferation and
differentiation [32]. Many previous studies confirmed
the strong relation between BMI-1 overexpression
and different types of human tumors—breast cancer
is one the most powerful examples of this relationship
[33, 34]. BMI-1 interacts with several signaling pathways
containing Akt, Notch, Wnt, Hedgehog, and receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK). In mammary stem cells, BMI-1
was shown to enhance cell proliferation via its effect of
Hedgehog signaling pathway [35].
Many reports discuss the relation between induction
of BMI-1 and its effect on the composition of the PcG
complex to favor proliferation over cell-cycle arrest,
which appeared to be dependent on the relative amounts
of BMI-1 in the complex and its biochemical and biologic
functions [36]. Besides the important role of BMI-1 in
bypassing apoptosis and the controlling of hematopoietic
stem cell division, it has recently become clear that BMI-1
also functions in the protection against oxidative stress. In
the absence of BMI-1, reactive oxygen species accumulate,
activating DNA damage response pathways and enhancing
cell apoptosis. The overexpression of BMI-1 will protect
both LSCs and blast cells against apoptosis, which may
explain the correlation between BMI-1 overexpression and
poor prognosis in our patients [37]. Down-modulation of
BMI-1 impairs self-renewal and long-term expansion of
LSCs and that by turn will be an important strategy in the
treatment of AML patients.

Limitations
All AML patients were newly diagnosed with
no history of myelodysplasia or any therapies (chemo
or radiotherapy). Cytogenetic and molecular profiles
were not complete for all patients. The number of bone
marrow samples from the AML patients was 40, but each
group (6 groups) had 3 to 16 patients. We are working
on further, larger-scale studies. Another limitation is that
TIM-3 is also expressed on T cells, and T cells represent
less than 5% of the cells in the normal bone marrow. Blast
cells in AML bone marrow samples were more than 90%
normalized with healthy bone marrow.
Further studies are required to confirm the
expression of these markers in a larger number of patients
in correlation to the full chromosomal and molecular
studies. We are working towards a target strategy that will
attack both extracellular markers (TIM-3 and / or CLL-1)
and intracellular molecule (BMI-1) at the same time. Such
a strategy might improve the selective targeting of AML
blast cells and result in reduced bone marrow cytotoxicity.

40 Egyptian patients presenting with CD34+ and CD34AML were obtained from newly diagnosed AML patients
after informed consent in accordance with the Declaration
of Helsinki.
Patients had not received any prior treatment for
any malignancy and also didn’t show any myelodysplasia
changes. Diagnosis of patients was based on morphology,
cyto-chemistry, immune-phenotyping, and cytogenetics. Our
AML groups consisted of M1 (acute myeloblastic leukemia
with minimal maturation), M2 (acute myeloblastic leukemia
with maturation), M3 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), M4
(acute myelomonocytic leukemia), M5 (acute monocytic
leukemia), and M7 (acute megakaryoblastic leukemia).

cDNA. The relative gene expressions in controls and
patients were determined by using the comparative CT
(2-ΔΔCt) method.

Cell lines and reagents
The Kasumi-1 and KG-1a cell lines were from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA,
USA) and are commonly used as AML cell lines [40, 41].

Cell death assay (MTT assay)
Cells were seeded in 96-well plates (50 × 103–
100  ×  103 per well) and were treated with purified
monoclonal Ab CD44, CD34 (BD Bioscience), TIM-3,
CLL-1 (BioLegend), and BMI-1 small molecule inhibitor
(PTC-209) (Xcess Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA)
using 3 different concentrations for each: (4, 2, 1 µg/100 µl)
for CD34 and CD44, (1, 0.5, 0.05 µg/100 µl) for TIM-3
and CLL-1, and 4 different concentrations for PTC-209
(0.2, 1. 2, 4 µM). Forty-eight and 72 hour assays were done
as described in the Figure legends. The cellular viability
of suspended cells was determined with the help of the
MTT assay. All the reactions were performed in triplicate.
Measured data of cellular viability were normalized using
viability values of untreated control cells (100%).

RNA isolation and qRT-PCR for normal bone
marrow and AML patients’ bone marrow
For PCR analysis of human bone marrow
mononuclear cells (MNCs), the total RNA was extracted
using a TRI kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Complementary DNA (cDNA) was
synthesized with the same concentration of RNA in all
samples and subjected to qPCR using Realplex Sequence
Detection System (Eppendorf, Hauppauge, NY, USA)
StepPlusOne thermal cycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Waltham, MA) with settings: 95°C for 10 min, followed by
40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s, and 60°C for 1 min. The primers
for CD34, TIM-3, CLL-1, BMI-1, and HTRP primer, housekeeping gene (used as internal control) (Table 1) were
obtained from Invitrogen (Grand Island, NY, USA).
All the reactions were performed in triplicate
with 20  µl Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (KAPA
Biosystem, Wilmington, MA, USA) containing 1.0 µl

Statistical analysis
Results are presented as means ± S.E.M. or ±
S.D. as indicated in Figure legends. Statistical analysis
was performed using  one-way ANOVA  followed by
Newman-Keuls post-test  when more than two groups
were being compared. Differences between groups
were considered  statistically significant for p ≤ 0.05.
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad
InStat 3 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA, USA). For KaplanMeier plot analysis we used GraphPad Prism software and
the log-rank test was applied. The log-rank test p value
indicates the significance of the correlation.

CONCLUSIONS
In summary, our data provides indicators about
the relationships between the expression level of several
LSC-related molecules investigated in this study and
the prognosis in our patients. Thus, those known and
potentially new markers might be used not only as
prognostic markers but also as promising markers for
selective targeting of LSCs and for eventually improving
the cure rate of AML.
