BACKGROUND: The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) recently released a “Top Five” list of opportunities to improve the
quality of cancer care. Item 4 on the list advises against using advanced imaging and biomarkers for surveillance in patients with
breast cancer who are treated with curative intent. This study examined concordance with ASCO follow-up care guidelines for breast
cancer survivors treated at an academic medical center. METHODS: Claims data and medical records were reviewed and abstracted
for early stage breast cancer survivors starting 1 year post diagnosis. A trained abstractor classified imaging tests as diagnostic or
surveillance. Proportions and frequencies were generated for receipt of services. Multilevel logistic regression was used to estimate
factors associated with receiving recommended and nonrecommended services and biomarker tests. RESULTS: Records were available for 258 patients. Mean age at diagnosis was 58 years (standard deviation of 13 years), mean time since diagnosis was 6 years
(standard deviation of 2 years), and 71% were stage 0/1. Only 47% of the sample received a mammogram within 1 year of diagnosis,
and 55% of the sample received at least 1 nonrecommended imaging service for surveillance purposes. Seventy-seven percent of the
sample received at least 1 nonrecommended biomarker test. Regression results indicate that main treating physician, advanced disease stage, younger age at diagnosis, and greater number of years since diagnosis were associated with receiving nonrecommended
services for surveillance. CONCLUSIONS: Use of nonrecommended services for surveillance occurs frequently among early-stage
breast cancer survivors. There are opportunities to increase use of guideline concordant posttreatment care for breast cancer surviC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
There are approximately 3 million breast cancer survivors in the United States.1 Mortality from breast cancer continues to
decline due to improvements in screening and treatment, and the majority of patients with breast cancer are diagnosed
with early-stage disease and can expect to have extended disease-free survival.2 Having survived their disease, most patients
enter into a prolonged posttreatment phase of care, where the value of active surveillance testing for cancer recurrence has
a limited evidence base. Specifically, 2 large Italian randomized trials of breast cancer posttreatment surveillance strategies
were conducted during the 1990s, and their results concluded that there was no significant difference in overall survival,
time to detection of recurrence, and quality of life perception between the high-intensity and control group monitoring.3-5
These studies were followed by 2 Cochrane systematic reviews that confirmed a lack of evidence for intensive surveillance for
recurrence in this setting.6,7 These findings prompted the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) to issue serial
guidelines and updates on this topic, with the first in 1996 with the most recent update in 2012.8-11
Current evidence-based guidelines for posttreatment surveillance care of patients with breast cancer, from ASCO11
and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN),12 include explicit recommendations for posttreatment care
as well as nonrecommended surveillance services, such as use of advanced imaging services and biomarker tests. Both
ASCO and NCCN guidelines recommend annual mammography and a recommended schedule of physician visits that
include medical history and physical examination: ASCO recommends a visit every 3 to 6 months for the first 3 years,
then every 6 to 12 months for years 4 and 5, and NCCN recommends a visit every 4 to 6 months for 5 years and then

annually thereafter. Importantly, both guidelines specify
that routine surveillance testing with imaging and/or
blood tests are not indicated and should only be considered if symptoms arise. Despite these guidelines, the literature reflects a reliance on biomarker tests and advanced
imaging for surveillance of breast cancer survivors, with
increasing use of imaging services over time.13-17 To
emphasize the importance of its breast cancer surveillance
guideline, ASCO included the guideline recommendations in the recently released “Top Five” list as part of the
American Board of Internal Medicine’s Choosing Wisely
campaign.18 The latter aims to promote evidence-based
clinical care that has beneficial effects on patient health by
improving treatment and/or reducing risks, and, where
possible, reduces costs of care.19 The ASCO Top Five list
advises against routine recurrence surveillance testing in
early-stage breast cancer survivors who have completed
curative treatment, and discourages use of advanced imaging tests, such as positron emission tomography (PET),
computed tomography (CT), and radionuclide bone
scans, and biomarker tests, such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, CA27.29, and
CA125).18 These are low value tests, given the lack of evidence available for benefit. In addition, it is important not
to expose breast cancer survivors to unnecessary services
that can cause significant harms: exposure to radiation
from imaging services, such as CT tests,20 false positive
results that can lead to further, more invasive testing,21
and increased patient anxiety.21
The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion of posttreatment breast cancer survivors receiving
ASCO-recommended and nonrecommended surveillance
procedures in a sample of patients treated and followed at
an academic medical center. We sought to determine how
frequently posttreatment breast cancer patients received
biomarker tests and imaging studies, and whether the latter were ordered for diagnostic or surveillance purposes.
We also identified whether patients received mammographic surveillance as recommended by ASCO guidelines, because other studies have indicated poor adherence
to this recommendation.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Identification of Sample

Breast cancer survivors were identified within an academic
medical center using an administrative data algorithm
based on Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) and
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes. The
algorithm was applied to administrative claims data for
Cancer

the interval between 2001 and 2009. This time interval
was chosen to allow for sufficient follow-up time after diagnosis and treatment for examination of posttreatment
surveillance care. This study received institutional review
board approval for all activities (UCLA Institutional
Review Board #10-000279).
Eligibility

All patients met the following eligibility criteria: female
nonmetastatic (stage 0-IIIA) breast cancer diagnosed
between January 1, 2001, and June 30, 2009; 21 years of
age and older at the time of diagnosis; no evidence of cancer recurrence or new primary cancer (any type) within
the surveillance time frame, and no evidence of previous
cancers; and at least 2 years of administrative and medical
records in order to assess use of posttreatment services.
Data Sources

We obtained data from administrative claims and medical
record abstraction. Variables obtained from administrative data included insurance type, date of birth, breast cancer diagnosis date, and imaging service and biomarker test
occurrences by date of test. Variables obtained from medical record data included stage of disease, treatments
received, and main treating physician, either a medical
oncologist or breast surgeon. A research assistant was
trained to perform the medical record abstractions. The
training and abstractions were overseen by the study principal investigator and a research nurse practitioner. We
captured imaging service and biomarker test data for this
protocol starting 1 year after the date of diagnosis to avoid
capturing services performed as part of the diagnostic
workup or possibly related to treatment complications
during active treatment. There was an average of 5 years
of surveillance data available per patient (range, 2-10
years).
Variables

The dependent variables were receipt of services: mammograms, imaging (chest and abdominal CT, chest and
abdominal magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], abdominal ultrasound, chest x-ray, radionuclide bone scan, PET
scan), and biomarker tests (CEA, CA27.29, CA125,
CA15-3). Independent variables were age at diagnosis,
time since diagnosis (years from date of diagnosis to November 1, 2011), cancer stage (stage 0/1 or stage 2/3A),
treatment type (mastectomy/lumpectomy, chemotherapy,
radiation), insurance type (health maintenance organization [HMO], preferred provider organization [PPO],
Medicare fee-for-service), and main treating physician

(assigned a unique identification number). Twenty-two
main treating physicians were identified. For patients
treated with surgery only, the breast surgeon was considered the main treating physician. For all other patients,
the medical oncologist with the majority of patient visits
was considered the main treating physician. The medical
oncologist was classified as the main treating physician for
90% of the sample. Insurance type was assigned based on
the insurer covering the majority of services and visits during the surveillance timeframe, based on the charges billed
to the patient’s insurance company. Patients enrolled in
Medicare Advantage plans were categorized with the
HMO group.
Diagnostic Versus Surveillance Status
Determination for Imaging Tests

We coded diagnostic versus surveillance use of posttreatment imaging services by medical record abstraction and
review. We reviewed the entire medical record available
from the academic medical center. Based on the strategy
developed by Cooper et al,22 the abstractor categorized
imaging services into 3 categories: 1) surveillance in the
absence of signs or symptoms suggestive of recurrence; 2)
diagnostic with signs or symptoms suggestive of recurrence, metastatic disease, or other disease or problem; or
3) indeterminate with no associated physician note. Categorization was based on the physician note associated with
the service and the associated ICD codes used for health
insurance billing. Physician notes that contained an active
statement describing routine follow-up care with an imaging service were categorized as surveillance. The lack of a
definitive statement of a new symptom or problem was
also considered reason to categorize an imaging service as
surveillance. However, it is possible that some of the
imaging services classified as surveillance were, in fact, ordered for a diagnostic reason that was not recorded in the
medical record or reflected in the associated ICD code.
This categorization strategy may have resulted in overestimation of surveillance imaging services. Services with
associated notes describing a new symptom or problem
were categorized as diagnostic. The 4% of services initially
categorized as indeterminate due to missing physician
notes were reviewed during group meetings that included
the research assistant, research nurse practitioner, and the
principal investigator. After discussion and review, consensus was reached on categorization of diagnostic or surveillance for the services initially categorized as
indeterminate. The majority of indeterminate services
were categorized as surveillance based on an associated
ICD code indicating breast cancer (eg, 174.xx). Our
4318

categorization approach was conservative: imaging services initially classified as diagnostic remained so throughout the surveillance time frame, even though the
subsequent follow-up could have been surveillance. A random sample of 15% of the records was also abstracted by
the research nurse practitioner as a second coder comparison. A kappa statistic comparing the classification of surveillance versus diagnostic was calculated to measure
agreement between the 2 sets of abstractions, yielding a
k 5 0.72 (“substantial” agreement).23
Data Analysis

All analyses were performed using Stata software, version
12.0. Means, ranges, and percentages were generated to
summarize patient demographics and cancer disease and
treatment characteristics. Proportions and frequencies
were generated for receipt of ASCO guideline recommended and nonrecommended services. Time to receipt
of first mammogram for eligible patients was estimated
using Kaplan-Meier estimates. Use of surveillance versus
diagnostic imaging services was examined with proportions. Multilevel logistic regression with a random effect
for main treating physician was used to estimate the
unique association of independent variables with receiving
recommended and nonrecommended imaging services
and biomarker tests. A multilevel model was used in order
to account for the clustering of patients within the main
treating physician variable.
RESULTS
Study Sample

The study sample included 258 survivors after excluding
126. The most common reason for exclusion was less than
2 years of surveillance time at the academic medical center. Many patients were initially treated at the center, but
then switched their care to a provider outside the academic health system. The mean age of the sample was 58
years (standard deviation [SD] 5 13) and the mean time
since diagnosis was 6 years (SD 5 2) (Table 1). The majority of patients had stage 0/1 disease and were treated
with lumpectomy and radiation, and 59% were enrolled
in an HMO insurance plan. Three physicians were
identified as the main treating physician for more than
half of the sample.
Use of Imaging and Biomarker Tests

Overall, 83% of the sample received at least 1 mammogram during the posttreatment period of observation. The

patients after cessation of active treatment (assumed to be

1. Those with bilateral mastectomy were excluded
(n 5 19). Forty-seven percent of the sample received the
first mammogram within a year of cessation of active
treatment, and 67% of the sample received the first mammogram within 2 years. Of the 120 patients who had a
first mammogram within 1 year of cessation of active
treatment, 56 (47%) had a second mammogram within
the next year (Table 2). We explored whether insurance
status influenced the percentage receiving a follow-up

HMO-insured patients received a mammogram within
the first year versus 40% of those with PPO or Medicare
insurance (P 5 .05, data not shown).

nonrecommended imaging service was chest x-ray, with
45% of the sample receiving at least 1 (Table 3); 30% of
the sample received at least 1 breast MRI, and 20%
received at least 1 chest CT. Eighty percent of the sample
received at least 1 nonrecommended biomarker test.
Seventy-seven percent of the sample received at least 1
CEA test, and 77% of the sample received at least 1
CA27.29. The majority of CEA and CA27.29 tests were
performed within the first 2 years after cessation of active

CA27.29 tests were performed 5 or more years after active
treatment ended. CA125 and CA15-3 tests were used less
commonly, with 18% and 5% receiving at least 1 of each
test, respectively.

breast MRIs (82%), 79 chest CTs (57%), and 72 PET
scans (93%) (Table 3). Only 28% of chest x-rays, the
most commonly used imaging service, were classified as
surveillance. The majority of abdominal MRI, abdominal
ultrasound, and bone scans were classified as diagnostic.
Out of all nonrecommended imaging services captured,
48% (514 of 1082) were classified as surveillance.
Variables Associated With Receiving Imaging
Services and Biomarker Tests

Stage of disease, age at diagnosis, and years since diagnosis
were significantly associated with receiving a nonrecommended imaging service that was classified as surveillance
(Table 4). The odds of receiving a nonrecommended
imaging service classified as surveillance were 2.70 times

higher for those who had stage 2 or stage 3A disease than
for those who had stage 0 or stage 1 disease (P 5 .01).
Younger age at diagnosis was associated with higher odds
of receiving a nonrecommended imaging service classified
as surveillance, with a 1-year increase in age at diagnosis
associated with a 3% decrease in the odds of receiving a
nonrecommended imaging service classified as surveillance (OR 5 0.97, P 5 .05). A 1-year increase in years
since diagnosis was associated with a 23% increase in
the odds of receiving a nonrecommended imaging
service classified as surveillance (odds ratio [OR] 5 1.23,
P 5 .02). Main treating physician was also important in
explaining variation in receipt of nonrecommended imaging services. The intraclass correlation (rho) for main
treating physician was 0.19 and significantly different
than zero, meaning that 19% of the variance in receiving a
nonrecommended imaging service classified as surveillance was accounted for by the main treating physician.
Radiation, age at diagnosis, and insurance type were
all significantly associated with receiving a mammogram.
The odds of receiving a mammogram were 1.98 times
higher for those who received radiation than for those
who did not (P 5 .08), and the odds of receiving a mammogram for those with Medicare fee-for-service insurance
were 8.99 times higher than those with HMO insurance
(P < .001). A 1-year increase in age at diagnosis resulted
in a 6% decrease in the odds of receiving a mammogram
(OR 5 0.94, P 5 .001). Main treating physician was also
important in explaining variation in receipt of mammograms. The intraclass correlation was 0.22 and significantly different than zero, meaning that 22% of the
variance in receiving a mammogram was accounted for by
the main treating physician.

of nonrecommended biomarker tests. The intraclass correlation for main treating physician was 0.56 and significantly different than zero, meaning that 56% of the

was accounted for by the main treating physician.
DISCUSSION
We examined use of ASCO-recommended and nonrecommended posttreatment services in a group of breast
cancer survivors treated and followed at an academic medical center. Only 47% of the sample received a recommended mammogram in the first year after cessation of
active treatment, which falls well short of the ASCO recommendation of 1 mammogram at 1 year after the initial
diagnostic mammogram. However, some patients may
have received mammograms outside of the academic
medical center, leading to an overestimation of the length
of time to the first mammogram. HMO-insured patients
in the sample had a slightly higher percentage of mammograms by the end of the first year than did patients insured
by PPO or Medicare (data not shown), although both
groups are well below the ASCO recommendation. However, our overall mammogram findings are similar to
other studies. A study using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry linked to Medicare claims
(SEER-Medicare) to examine use of annual mammograms in a cohort of breast cancer survivors found that
only 62% received annual mammograms.24 Other studies
have reported rates of annual mammograms for breast
cancer survivors from 50% to 80%.16,25-27 We also found
that nonrecommended imaging services were used frequently, particularly chest x-ray, with almost half of the
sample receiving at least 1 procedure. Nonrecommended
biomarker tests were also commonly used, particularly
CEA and CA27.29.
Importantly, we were able to categorize the nonrecommended imaging services as surveillance or diagnostic using medical record abstraction. The majority of
published studies examining adherence to breast cancer
surveillance guidelines used administrative data
only.14,16,28 A 2006 study characterized posttreatment
care in cancer survivors as surveillance or diagnostic
using medical record abstraction.22 The results showed
that 49% of imaging services for breast cancer survivors
were used for surveillance only. In our study, 48% of all
imaging services were classified as surveillance. PET
scans were almost uniformly classified as surveillance
(93%), and breast MRIs (82%) and abdominal CTs
(61%) were classified as surveillance the majority of the
time. These services were routinely ordered with 55% of
4322

the sample receiving at least 1 nonrecommended imaging test classified as surveillance, despite the evidence
showing little to no benefit of aggressive posttreatment
surveillance programs.6,10,29 However, this may be an
overestimation of services ordered for surveillance. Our
classification scheme assigned imaging services that
lacked a definitive statement of a new symptom or problem as surveillance, potentially misclassifying services
that were in fact diagnostic. Most imaging services did
have an associated note that contained an active statement of surveillance or diagnosis of a new symptom or
problem, but some associated notes were vague, leading
to uncertainty regarding classification.
The variables associated with receipt of a nonrecommended imaging service for surveillance purposes
show that ordering these services is influenced by a
diverse set of factors (Table 4). For patients with higher
stage disease and younger age at diagnosis, physicians
and patients may elect a more aggressive surveillance
approach with the hope of identifying recurrent or new
disease early, although available evidence does not support this approach. The main treating physician was significant in each of the three models, accounting for 19%,
22%, and 56% of the variance in receiving a nonrecommended imaging service for surveillance, receiving a
mammogram, and receiving a nonrecommended biomarker test, respectively. This finding suggests that
appropriate feedback to individual physicians about their
usage patterns could influence subsequent adherence to
guidelines. Patient demand for services may also play a
role in these findings.
This study has several limitations. First, this is a relatively small sample of patients treated and followed at a
single academic center. This allowed us to do detailed
medical record abstractions, providing important data on
use of posttreatment services. However, this limits the
generalizability of our findings. Other types of institutions
may have very different practices and customs for posttreatment follow-up care, although several larger studies
have found poor adherence to posttreatment guidelines
for cancer patients generally.13,16,22,30 Second, imaging
services initially classified as diagnostic remained so
throughout the surveillance timeframe, a conservative
approach that potentially underestimates the number of
surveillance services. Even using this conservative
approach we found a high percentage of imaging services
were used for surveillance purposes. Third, we used data
solely from one academic medical center and did not seek
outside records. Patients may have received care elsewhere, which could have led to underestimation of

appropriate and inappropriate services. Our examination
of the sample by insurance group shows that even HMOinsured patients who can be expected to receive all of their
care within the academic medical center did not all receive
mammograms within the first year after diagnosis, suggesting that underuse of recommended services is a systematic problem. Finally, we had limited patient-level
variables. Potentially important demographic variables
and patient awareness/desire for posttreatment care were
not available from our data sources.
In conclusion, our findings show a high rate of nonrecommended testing and underuse of mammographic
screening in early-stage breast cancer survivors treated and
followed at an academic medical center. These patterns
were observed in a setting where individual physicians do
not have a financial incentive for ordering tests and services, and should have access to evidence-based guidelines
to direct follow-up care. This suggests that the ordering of
nonrecommended services is a complex process driven by
multiple factors, only some of which were captured in this
study. Overuse of posttreatment services is a persistent
problem with potentially serious impacts: false positive
results that may lead to use of unnecessary invasive procedures, financial costs, and heightened patient anxiety. As
the population of breast cancer survivors continues to
grow, it will be of even greater importance to base
posttreatment care decisions on available evidence and
guidelines.
