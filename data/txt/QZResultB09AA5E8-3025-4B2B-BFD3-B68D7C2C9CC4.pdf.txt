Abstract
Resistance to chemotherapy remains a major obstacle for the
treatment of breast cancer. Understanding the molecular
mechanism(s) of resistance is crucial for the development
of new effective therapies to treat this disease. This study
examines the putative role of p130Cas (Cas) in resistance to the
cytotoxic agent Adriamycin. High expression of Cas in primary
breast tumors is associated with the failure to respond to the
antiestrogen tamoxifen and poor prognosis, highlighting the
potential clinical importance of this molecule. Here, we show a
novel association between Cas and resistance to Adriamycin. We
show that Cas overexpression renders MCF-7 breast cancer cells
less sensitive to the growth inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of
Adriamycin. The catalytic activity of the nonreceptor tyrosine
kinase c-Src, but not the epidermal growth factor receptor, is
critical for Cas-mediated protection from Adriamycin-induced
death. The phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) is elevated in Cas-overexpressing
cells treated with Adriamycin, whereas expression of the
proapoptotic protein Bak is decreased. Conversely, Cas depletion in the more resistant T47D and MDA-MB-231 cell lines
increases sensitivity to Adriamycin. Based on these data, we
propose that Cas activates growth and survival pathways
regulated by c-Src, Akt, and ERK1/2 that lead to the inhibition
of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in the presence of Adriamycin. Because Cas is frequently expressed at high levels in
breast cancers, these findings raise the possibility of resensitizing Cas-overexpressing tumors to chemotherapy through perturbation of Cas signaling pathways. [Cancer Res 2008;68(21):8796–804]

Introduction
Breast cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death in women,
second only to lung cancer.1 Chemotherapy has been shown to
benefit most women with breast cancer, especially those patients
whose tumors are estrogen receptor (ER)–negative or who have
become refractory to hormone therapy (1). In the United States, one
of the most frequently used agents for treating breast cancer is the
chemotherapeutic drug Adriamycin (doxorubicin). When Adriamycin is given as a single-agent treatment, response rates are typically
40% to 60% and can be as high as 80% (2). Yet, despite its efficacy
against breast cancer, resistance to Adriamycin is a major clinical
problem and an important cause for treatment failure. Several

mechanisms have been suggested to cause resistance to Adriamycin
in breast tumor cells. They include the overexpression of
P-glycoprotein and other plasma membrane multidrug transporters
(2, 3); failure to undergo apoptosis caused by alterations in Bcl-2,
Bcl-XL, or Bax expression (4–6); and alterations in drug targets, such
as topoisomerase II (7). However, because treatments targeting these
pathways have been met with little success, additional factors must
also play a role in promoting resistance to Adriamycin. Identification
of these mechanisms will facilitate the development of more effective
strategies to overcome Adriamycin resistance in breast cancer.
A number of cytoplasmic signaling molecules have been
implicated in resistance of breast tumor cells to Adriamycin,
including focal adhesion kinase, Akt, and extracellular signalregulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2; refs. 8, 9). Expression of the
scaffolding molecule p130Cas [Cas; also known as breast cancer
antiestrogen resistance 1 (BCAR1)] was found to be up-regulated in
MCF-7 and ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells treated with Adriamycin
(10). Interestingly, high expression of Cas in primary breast tumors
correlates with the failure to respond to the antiestrogen tamoxifen
and poor prognosis (11). Cas overexpression in estrogen-dependent
ZR-75-1, T47D, and MCF-7 breast cancer cells is sufficient to drive
proliferation in the presence of the antiestrogens tamoxifen and ICI
182,780 (12, 13). Despite the fact that these cells proliferate in the
presence of tamoxifen under conditions of high Cas expression,
gene expression driven from estrogen-regulated promoters is
generally inhibited (12, 13). This suggests that Cas overexpression
activates cell proliferation pathways that are independent of ERdependent gene regulation. Work from our group has shown that
these pathways include the protein tyrosine kinase c-Src, signaling
from the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and signal
transducer and activator of transcription 5b (STAT5b; ref. 13).
In this study, we show that, in addition to tamoxifen resistance,
Cas mediates resistance to the apoptotic and antiproliferative effects
of Adriamycin in human breast cancer cells. Cas-mediated
protection from Adriamycin requires the kinase activity of c-Src,
but not that of the EGFR. Cas overexpression promotes activation of
Akt and ERK1/2 in the presence of Adriamycin and alters the balance
of Bcl-2 family members in favor of the antiapoptotic proteins.
Conversely, Cas depletion increases sensitivity to the death-inducing
effects of Adriamycin. Based on these findings, we suggest that
Adriamycin resistance, mediated by Cas, results from the sum of
signals arising from activation of survival and proliferative pathways
and inhibition of the mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway.

bovine serum (FBS), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 4 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 Ag/mL G418, and 0.75 Ag/mL puromycin. T47D cells were cultured in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
1 glucose, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, and
7 Ag/mL insulin. MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 mmol/L sodium pyruvate.

described previously (14, 15). Antibodies obtained were as follows:
phosphorylated Akt (S473), total Akt, Bcl-2, Cas, Crk, and poly(ADP-ribose)
polymerase 1 (PARP1; BD Biosciences); phosphorylated ERK1/2, actin, and
h-tubulin (Sigma); ERK (Cell Signaling Technology); Bak (Upstate); Bax,
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH; Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and Bcl-XL (Millipore). Doxycycline, Adriamycin, and RNase
(Sigma); PP2 and AG1478 (Calbiochem); rhodamine 123 (R123) and
propidium iodide (PI; Molecular Probes); and DNase I (Invitrogen) were
purchased from the indicated sources.
R123 incorporation. Cells (2.5  105) were plated in 60-mm dishes and
cultured in the presence or absence of 1 Ag/mL doxycycline for 48 h. Cells
were washed and placed in medium supplemented with vehicle or the
indicated concentration of Adriamycin in the presence or absence of
1 Ag/mL doxycycline. The cells were collected 48 h later, incubated with the
membrane-permeable lipophilic cationic fluorochrome R123 (200 nmol/L),
and analyzed by flow cytometry.
RNA interference and transfections. BCAR1 stealth select RNA
interference (siCas) and nontargeting control small interfering RNA (siRNA;
siControl) were purchased from Invitrogen and Dharmacon Research,
respectively. A second oligonucleotide (GUCUACGACGUUCCUCCAU) was
synthesized directed against the YXXP substrate-binding domain of Cas
(siYXXP). Transfections were conducted in six-well plates using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, RNA duplexes (600 pmol) were
complexed with Lipofectamine RNAiMax in six-well plates for 10 min at
room temperature, and 8  105 cells were subsequently added. At 24 h later,
cells were collected, counted, and replated at a concentration of 2.5  105

supplemented with vehicle or 3 Amol/L Adriamycin in the presence or
absence of 1 Ag/mL doxycycline. Cells were processed 48 h later for terminal
deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
staining using an in situ cell death detection kit (Roche Applied Science)
and analyzed by flow cytometry, or for cell cycle analysis by staining with
40 Ag/mL PI solution in the presence of 100 Ag/mL RNase followed by flow
cytometry. Cell cycle was quantified using the Denn-Jett-Fox modeling
algorithm.
Flow cytometry. Adherent cells were trypsinized, collected, combined
with floating cells, and fixed using the BD Cytofix/Cytoperm solution (BD
Bioscience) for 20 min at 4jC (cells for the R123 studies were not fixed).

(Becton Dickinson). Analysis of data was performed using the Flowjo flow
cytometry software (Tree Star, Inc.).
Densitometry. Densitometry was performed by the Molecular Dynamics
densitometer (Molecular Dynamics) and quantified with ImageQuant 5.0
software (GE).
Statistical analyses. Two-tailed Student’s t tests were used for the pairwise comparison of experimental groups.

Results
Differential sensitivity of human breast cancer cell lines to
Adriamycin. One mechanism by which Adriamycin exerts its
cytotoxic activity is through induction of apoptosis via the
mitochondrial intrinsic pathway (16). To begin to investigate the

www.aacrjournals.org

role of Cas in Adriamycin resistance, we determined the sensitivity
of several human breast cancer cell lines to Adriamycin using R123
incorporation, a measure of mitochondrial transmembrane potential. MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 (231) cells were treated with
increasing concentrations of Adriamycin for 48 hours, and R123
incorporation was analyzed by flow cytometry. T47D cells (ER+,
model of early-stage breast cancer) were completely insensitive to
the death-inducing effects of Adriamycin (Fig. 1A, squares),
whereas MDA-MB-231 cells (ER , model of more advanced stage
breast cancer) showed a 30% decrease in R123 incorporation at the
maximum drug concentration (diamonds). MCF-7 cells (ER+,
model of early-stage breast cancer) were the most sensitive cell
line, displaying an initial 50% reduction in R123 incorporation at
1 Amol/L Adriamycin and an additional 10% decline at 3 to
20 Amol/L (triangles). These results show that sensitivity to
Adriamycin differs among human breast cancer cell lines and
neither ER status nor tumor cell ‘‘aggressiveness’’ seems to be
reliable predictors of sensitivity to this drug.
In a previous study, we noted that Cas expression was variable in
human breast cancer cell lines (17). To test whether the differing
sensitivity to Adriamycin could be due to Cas levels in the cell, Cas
expression was measured in the three cell lines. Cas was expressed
in the resistant T47D cell line at levels that were 2.1-fold above
those seen in the sensitive MCF-7 cell line (Fig. 1B). MDA-MB-231
cells, which exhibited intermediate sensitivity to Adriamycin,
contained 1.7-fold greater amounts of Cas relative to MCF-7 cells.
Interestingly, the Cas that was present in T47D and MDA-MB-231

cells displayed retarded electrophoretic mobility compared with
Cas in MCF-7 cells; this slower migrating species represents the
hyperphosphorylated form of Cas (18). Phosphorylation of Cas,
which is predominately mediated by c-Src (19), plays a critical
role in its function as a regulator of survival and proliferation

(14, 20, 21). Thus, the elevated expression of highly phosphorylated
Cas in resistant cells suggests that Cas may play a role in the
cellular response to Adriamycin through its ability to modulate
growth and survival pathways.
Cas promotes resistance to Adriamycin. To address whether
Cas expression has an effect on Adriamycin-induced cell death,
MCF-7 breast cancer cells that stably express tetracycline-regulated
(Tet-off) constructs encoding vector sequences or Myc-Cas were
grown in the presence or absence of 1 Ag/mL doxycycline for
48 hours to modulate Cas levels. Cas was expressed f6-fold over
endogenous levels in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 2A, inset).
These cells were then cultured for an additional 48 hours in 0 to
20 Amol/L Adriamycin in the presence or absence of doxycycline,
and R123 incorporation was assessed by flow cytometry. In the
presence of increasing concentrations of Adriamycin, the percentage of cells incorporating R123 was consistently reduced by f40%
in cells expressing endogenous (1) Cas compared with cells with
6-fold above endogenous levels of Cas (Fig. 2A). These differences
in mitochondrial transmembrane potential suggest that Cas may
promote resistance to Adriamycin through up-regulation of
survival signals emanating from the mitochondria.
To further evaluate the effect of Cas overexpression on
Adriamycin-induced apoptosis, TUNEL staining was performed on
Cas-inducible or vector-controlled MCF-7 cells cultured, as described above. Adriamycin treatment induced apoptosis, as
measured by TUNEL positivity, in vector-control cells and in the
Cas-inducible cell line when Cas was expressed at endogenous levels
(Fig. 2B, gray and black columns). Cas overexpression significantly
inhibited Adriamycin-induced apoptosis (checkered-black column).
In parallel, the effect of Adriamycin on the cell cycle was assessed
as a function of Cas expression by determining the percentage of
cells in G0-G1, S, and G2-M. Cells were cultured as described above,
stained with PI, and analyzed by flow cytometry to determine the
percentage of cells in each phase (Supplementary Fig. S1). Cas
overexpression induced a significant increase in the percentage of
cells in the S phase regardless of treatment (Fig. 2C). Adriamycin
caused a significant increase in G0-G1 and a concomitant decrease

Cas-Mediated Adriamycin Resistance

in the percentage of cells in the S phase when Cas was expressed at
endogenous levels, indicative of a G0-G1 arrest. In contrast, cells
overexpressing Cas exhibited no G0-G1 block, and as stated above,
the percentage of cells in S phase increased.
We hypothesized that, if Cas overexpression could render
sensitive cells resistant to Adriamycin, then depletion of Cas in
resistant cells might have the opposite effect. T47D cells, which
exhibited the greatest level of resistance to Adriamycin, were
depleted for Cas with the use of targeted siRNAs (Fig. 2D, top left)
and cultured in the presence of 0 to 2 Amol/L Adriamycin for
48 hours. As expected, treatment of these cells with Adriamycin
alone had no significant effect on R123 incorporation (Fig. 2D, left
graph, black columns). However, cells treated with Cas-targeted
siRNAs showed a significant reduction in R123 incorporation after
Adriamycin treatment (siCas, gray columns) compared with mocktransfected and siControl-treated cells (black and white collumns,
respectively). Thus, upon Cas depletion, T47D cells become
sensitized to Adriamycin-induced apoptosis.
To examine whether this was unique to the T47D cell line, we
also investigated the effect of Cas depletion in MDA-MB-231 cells,
which showed an intermediate sensitivity to Adriamycin. Again,
Adriamycin had no significant effect on mock-transfected or
siControl-treated MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2D, right graph, black and
white columns). However, Cas depletion by siCas resulted in a
significant decrease in R123 incorporation in the presence of
2 Amol/L Adriamycin (gray column). To exclude nonspecific effects,
similar Cas depletion experiments were performed in MDA-MB-231
cells using a second independent siRNA oligonucleotide targeting
Cas (siYXXP). As was the case for siCas, MDA-MB-231 cells treated
with siYXXP exhibited greater sensitivity to Adriamycin than did
control cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Taken together, these results
indicate that Cas depletion reverses chemoresistance and sensitizes these cells to the cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin.
Cas-dependent Adriamycin resistance requires the kinase
activity of c-Src. We and others have previously shown that Cas is a
potent activator of c-Src kinase activity through its ability to bind to
the Src homology 2 (SH2) and SH3 domains, thus relieving its
autoinhibitory conformation (14, 20, 22). To test the requirement for
c-Src kinase activity in Cas-mediated resistance to Adriamycin, Casinducible MCF-7 cells were treated with the Src-family kinase
inhibitor PP2 in the presence or absence of 3 Amol/L Adriamycin
and then analyzed for R123 incorporation. Consistent with the data
in Fig. 2A, Adriamycin treatment resulted in a marked decrease in
R123 incorporation in cells expressing endogenous Cas, whereas
cells overexpressing Cas showed significantly greater R123 incorporation (Fig. 3A; medium, Adriamycin-treated cells). However, in the
presence of PP2, Cas overexpression was no longer seen to protect
the cells from the toxic effects of Adriamycin (compare white
columns in Adriamycin-treated medium versus PP2 groupings).
TUNEL assays were performed to confirm these results. As was
the case in Fig. 2B, the extent of apoptosis induced by Adriamycin
was significantly reduced in cells overexpressing Cas (Fig. 3B;
medium, Adriamycin-treated cells). PP2 treatment resulted in a
significant increase in apoptosis under both control and Casoverexpressing conditions when cells were cultured in Adriamycin
(PP2, Adriamycin-treated cells). In addition, the protective effect of
Cas overexpression on Adriamycin-induced cell death was
significantly less in the presence of PP2. Whereas Cas overexpression resulted in f70% decrease in the number of TUNELpositive cells when cultured in the presence of Adriamycin (Fig. 3C;
medium, Adriamycin-treated cells), only f32% decrease was

observed in the presence of both Adriamycin and PP2 (PP2,

had a protective effect on the low level of TUNEL positivity
observed in the absence of Adriamycin, resulting in f80% decrease
in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (medium, vehicle-treated
cells). This effect was similar in PP2-treated cells in the absence of

Adriamycin (PP2, vehicle-treated cells). These data indicate that
c-Src kinase activity contributes specifically to Cas-dependent
protection from Adriamycin-induced apoptosis.
Because EGFR signaling contributes to Cas-mediated antiestrogen
resistance (13), we next investigated whether EGFR catalytic activity
was required for Cas-dependent resistance to Adriamycin. Casoverexpressing cells grown in the presence or absence of 1 Ag/mL
doxycycline were treated with 3 Amol/L Adriamycin and the EGFR
kinase inhibitor AG1478. Cas overexpression continued to provide
protection from the toxic actions of Adriamycin in the presence of
AG1478, as seen by R123 incorporation (Fig. 3A) and TUNEL
positivity (Fig. 3B). Cas overexpression resulted in f72% decrease in
the number of TUNEL-positive cells cultured in the presence of both
Adriamycin and AG1478 (Fig. 3C; AG1478, Adriamycin-treated cells),
similar to the f70% reduction in the presence of either agent
alone. Thus, in contrast to c-Src activity, EGFR kinase activity did not
seem to contribute to the protective effect of Cas overexpression
against the cytotoxic activity of Adriamycin.
Cas overexpression is associated with the activation of Akt
and ERK1/2. Because Cas expression seemed to play a role in the
cellular response to Adriamycin, we next investigated whether drug
treatment affected the level of Cas in the cell. Interestingly,
endogenous Cas was markedly reduced after Adriamycin treatment
(Fig. 4A, top, compare lanes 1 and 3 and B, left), but the level of Cas
remained high in cells overexpressing Cas (Fig. 4A, lane 4 and B). The
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway, which can be
activated in response to both c-Src activation and Cas overexpression
(23), contributes to chemoresistance and radioresistance (24). To
assess whether Cas overexpression affects Akt activity, phosphorylation of S473 on Akt was evaluated. Akt phosphorylation was not
altered by Cas expression in the absence of drug (Fig. 4A, second panel
and B, middle). However, pAktS473 became significantly elevated in
Cas-overexpressing cells after 48 hours of Adriamycin treatment.
ERK1/2 has also been reported to be activated in response to Cas
overexpression and c-Src activation (22, 23). Phosphorylated ERK1/
2 levels were measured to determine whether ERK1/2 is
differentially activated during Adriamycin treatment in the

presence of high levels of Cas. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was
elevated in Cas-overexpressing cells compared with cells expressing
endogenous levels of Cas, irrespective of whether the cells were
treated with Adriamycin or not (Fig. 4A, fourth panel, lanes 2 and 4
and B, right, white columns). Whereas total ERK1/2 levels decreased
in the presence of Adriamycin, phosphorylated ERK1/2 was
selectively enhanced in cells expressing either endogenous or
overexpressed levels of Cas. However, phosphorylated ERK1/2 was
elevated to a greater extent in Cas-overexpressing cells compared
with cells expressing endogenous Cas.
Cas regulates the expression of Bcl-2 family members. The
changes in R123 incorporation reported above suggest that Cas
protects against mitochondrial membrane damage after Adriamycin treatment. We hypothesized that Cas expression might affect
the expression of one or more of the Bcl-2 family members that
control the intrinsic death pathway. To test this hypothesis, the
expression of Bcl-2 family members was measured in MCF-7 cells
induced to overexpress Cas. Expression of the proapoptotic protein
Bak was decreased by f40% as a function of Cas overexpression
(Fig. 5A, second panel, compare lanes 1 and 2, and densitometry).
Adriamycin treatment had little effect on Bak expression in cells
expressing endogenous Cas (lane 3). However, Bak expression was
significantly reduced when cells overexpressing Cas were treated
with Adriamycin (lane 4). This result was consistently observed in
four independent experiments. In contrast to Bak, expression of the
proapoptotic protein Bax and the antiapoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and
Bcl-XL did not change in response to Adriamycin treatment or Cas
expression levels (third to fifth panels).
The corresponding loss-of-function approach was taken in MDAMB-231 cells to assess whether depletion of Cas in Adriamycinresistant cell lines would also affect the expression of Bcl-2 family
members. Cas depletion resulted in increased levels of Bak
(2.6-fold) relative to control cells in the absence of Adriamycin
(Fig. 5B, second panel and densitometry), demonstrating that Bak
expression can be regulated by Cas in these cells under normal
growth conditions. However, when the cells were treated with
Adriamycin, siControl-treated and siCas-treated cells contained

proapoptotic members. Interestingly, Adriamycin did not completely abrogate endogenous Cas expression in siControl-treated
MDA-MB-231 cells as it did in MCF-7 cells (top, lane 3). Moreover,
only the slower migrating, hyperphosphorylated form of Cas
remained. We suggest that the prosurvival signals resulting from
the continued presence of phosphorylated Cas may outweigh
proapoptotic signals generated by this shift in the balance of Bcl-2
proteins when control cells are treated with Adriamycin.

Adriamycin-induced cell death also depends on activation of
caspases, which play crucial roles in the proteolysis of a number of
key targets (25). Thus, we hypothesized that Cas overexpression
might result in the inhibition of caspase activation. One target of
caspase activity is Cas, which has been reported to be cleaved
during etoposide-induced apoptosis (26). As discussed above,
endogenous Cas was significantly diminished in response to
Adriamycin treatment in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. This
coincided with the appearance of a 31-kDa cleavage product after
Adriamycin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). Both the decrease
in full-length Cas and the accumulation of the 31-kDa fragment
were less pronounced in the presence of the caspase inhibitor
z-VAD-fmk (data not shown), implicating caspases in the
Adriamycin-induced proteolysis of endogenous Cas. Interestingly,
the 31-kDa fragment was also present in Adriamycin-treated Casoverexpressing cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, full-length
Cas is still expressed at high levels under these conditions (Figs. 4A
and 5A). To examine caspase activity at the molecular level, the
extent of cleavage of the caspase substrate PARP1 was measured in
the Cas-inducible MCF-7 cells. In the absence of Adriamycin,
PARP1 was present as a full-length, 118-kDa species in both control
and Cas-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5C, lanes 1 and 2). After
Adriamycin treatment, PARP1 was cleaved in control cells,
resulting in a reduction in the 118-kDa species and the appearance
of an 85-kDa fragment (lane 3). Cleavage of PARP1 was significantly
reduced in Cas-overexpressing cells after Adriamycin treatment
(lane 4), suggesting that overexpression of Cas blocked the
activation of the caspases responsible for PARP1 cleavage.

The growth and survival pathways that promote resistance to
Adriamycin in the presence of high Cas expression share many
features with those pathways that regulate Cas-dependent estrogen
signaling and antiestrogen resistance. Cabodi and colleagues

Discussion
Cas is overexpressed in a large number of breast cancers,
coincident with increased resistance to tamoxifen and poor
relapse-free and overall survival rates (11). Here, we have examined
the putative role of Cas in resistance to the cytotoxic agent
Adriamycin. We show for the first time that MCF-7 cells
overexpressing Cas are less sensitive to the growth inhibitory and
proapoptotic effects of Adriamycin. The kinase activity of c-Src, but
not that of the EGFR, is required for Cas-mediated enhancement of
cell proliferation and survival in the presence of Adriamycin. Akt
and ERK1/2 activation are up-regulated when cells overexpressing
Cas are treated with Adriamycin, coincident with a downregulation in Bak expression. This results in a shift toward
prosurvival/proliferation signals stemming from Akt and ERK1/2
and away from proapoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Based on these
findings, we propose that Cas overexpression in sensitive cells
activates growth and survival pathways that are regulated by c-Src,
Akt, and ERK1/2 and leads to the inhibition of mitochondrialmediated cell death and promotion of continued proliferation in
the presence of Adriamycin (Fig. 6A). Conversely, Cas depletion in
more resistant cell lines results in a shift toward proapoptotic Bcl-2
proteins, coincident with decreased R123 incorporation in the
presence of Adriamycin (Fig. 6B). However, residual expression of
hyperphosphorylated Cas, which is seen when siControl-treated
cells are treated with Adriamycin, may protect cells from the
cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin in the presence of a similar shift
toward proapoptotic Bcl-2 signals (Fig. 6C). These results bring to
light a novel association between Cas overexpression and
Adriamycin resistance, a finding that is relevant to human breast
cancer because Cas is often found to be expressed at high levels in
breast tumors (11).

Cas-Mediated Adriamycin Resistance

showed that Cas overexpression in T47D cells caused increased
c-Src and ERK1/2 activities in response to estrogen (22). More
recently, our group showed that Cas-dependent resistance to
tamoxifen involved a signaling axis that included c-Src, EGFR, and
STAT5b (13). Interestingly, whereas the data presented above
indicate that c-Src kinase activity is important for Cas-dependent
Adriamycin resistance, the catalytic activity of the EGFR seems to
be less important. These data are not necessarily inconsistent with
our previous data on tamoxifen resistance, because the earlier
study implicated EGFR functions that could have been independent of its catalytic activity. It would seem, from the sum of the
data, that high Cas expression in breast cancer cells activates
potent proliferation/survival programs that override a variety of
inputs that would otherwise induce cell cycle arrest and/or death.
One component of the Cas signaling axis that seems to control
resistance to Adriamycin is Akt. Others have found a correlation
between transient Akt activation and chemoresistance of human
breast tumors (8, 27). Cas binds to the p85 subunit of PI3K under a
number of conditions, providing a potential link between Cas
overexpression and Akt activation (21, 28, 29). In addition to Akt,
ERK1/2 activity was found to be up-regulated in Cas-overexpressing cells. Evidence for an association between ERK1/2 activation
and chemotherapeutic resistance is somewhat conflicting. Two
groups have shown that ERK1/2 activation correlates with
protection from cytotoxic drugs (30, 31). However, others report
that ERK activation facilitates DNA damage–induced apoptosis
(32–34). It would seem from these conflicting data that the role
played by ERK1/2 in therapeutic resistance can vary, depending on
both the nature of the cellular insult and the cell type.
The data presented above are the first to show a link between
Cas overexpression and protection from mitochondrial-mediated
cell death. Results from the R123 incorporation studies suggest that
Cas overexpression contributes to the maintenance of mitochondrial membrane integrity in the presence of Adriamycin. The
proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members, Bak and Bax, are considered to
be the gatekeepers of this cell death pathway. In cells expressing
endogenous Cas levels, Bak expression remained unchanged
48 hours post–Adriamycin treatment (Fig. 5A). In contrast, Bak
expression was reduced when Cas was overexpressed and
significantly more decreased when the cells were treated with
Adriamycin. Because other Bcl-2 members were unaffected by Cas
levels in the MCF-7 model, this reduction in Bak expression would
result in a decrease in the ratio of proapoptotic to antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 family members, ultimately leading to reduced activation of
the mitochondrial death pathway after Adriamycin treatment.
Because Akt and/or ERK1/2 activity have been shown to influence
the intrinsic cell death pathway through the regulation of Bcl-2
family proteins (35–38), we propose that Cas overexpression may
inhibit mitochondrial-mediated cell death by maintaining a low
level of the proapoptotic protein Bak through the combined
activation of Akt and ERK1/2. Results from the MDA-MB-231 and
T47D models suggest that additional factors may also play a role.
Specifically, it seems that expression of hyperphosphorylated Cas,

which has been shown to regulate cell growth and survival
pathways (14, 20, 21), may override proapoptotic signals stemming
from Bcl-2 family members.
Overexpression of human enhancer of filamentation 1 (HEF1),
which belongs to the Cas family of adaptor proteins, results in the
activation of caspases, cleavage of HEF1, and apoptosis of MCF-7
cells in the absence of any exogenous stress (39). It is noteworthy to
mention that the caspase activity in this instance is likely due to
caspase-7 or one of the other redundant caspases active in MCF-7
cells, as these cells have been reported to be deficient of caspase-3
(40). Based on the data reported herein, it would seem that Cas and
HEF1 function quite differently in controlling cell survival. Rather
than inducing cell death, Cas overexpression had positive effects on
cell proliferation and survival, both in the presence and absence of
Adriamycin (Fig. 2B and C). Coincidentally, Cas overexpression did
not result in PARP cleavage, suggesting that caspase activity was
not induced under these conditions (Fig. 5C). Nonetheless, Cas has
been previously identified as a substrate for caspases during
treatment with etoposide, staurosporine, and cisplatin (26, 41).
Indeed, we have observed a decrease in full-length Cas after
treatment of cells with Adriamycin, and this coincided with the
appearance of a 31-kDa carboxyterminal fragment that has been
reported to accumulate in response to caspase cleavage of Cas and
induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (26, 39). Interestingly, the 31-kDa
species was detected in Cas-overexpressing cells and may
contribute to the low level of apoptosis exhibited by these cells
in the presence of Adriamycin (see Fig. 2B). However, full-length
Cas remains high under these conditions, coincident with the cells
exhibiting greater resistance to the cytotoxic effects of Adriamycin.
This suggests that the progrowth and survival activities of fulllength Cas may play a dominant role over the apoptotic activities
of the 31-kDa fragment in the presence of Adriamycin.
Together, these data support a model whereby the cellular
response to cytotoxic therapies, such as Adriamycin, is governed by
the balance and integration of proliferation, survival, and death
pathways. Because Cas overexpression in human breast tumors is
associated with poor prognosis, this study identifies the Cas
signaling axis as a potential target that can be exploited to enhance
the efficacy of Adriamycin treatment and/or prevent resistance.
