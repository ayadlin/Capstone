ABSTRACT
There is an urgent clinical need for targeted therapy approaches for triplenegative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. Increasing evidences suggested that the
expression of estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα) was correlate with unfavorable
clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients. We here show that inhibition of ERRα by
its inverse agonist XCT-790 can suppress the proliferation, decrease G2/M phases, and
induce mitochondrial-related apoptosis of TNBC cells. XCT-790 elevates the proteins
related to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress such as ATF4/6, XBT-1 and CHOP. It also
increases the expression of growth inhibition related proteins such as p53 and p21.
Further, XCT-790 can increase the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in
TNBC cells mainly through inhibition of SOD1/2. While ROS scavenger NAC abolishes
XCT-790 induced ER-stress and growth arrest. XCT-790 treatment can rapidly activate
the signal molecules including ERK1/2, p38-MAPK, JNK, Akt, p65, and IκBα, while NAC
attenuates effects of XCT-790 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38-MAPK and Akt.
Further, the inhibitors of ERK1/2, JNK, Akt, and NF-κB attenuate XCT-790 induced
ROS generation. These data suggest that AKT/ROS and ERK/ROS positive feedback
loops, NF-κB/ROS, and ROS/p38-MAPK, are activated in XCT-790 treated TNBC cells.
In vivo experiments show that XCT-790 significantly suppresses the growth of MDAMB-231 xenograft tumors, which is associated with up regulation of p53, p21, ERstress related proteins while down regulation of bcl-2. The present discovery makes
XCT-790 a promising candidate drug and lays the foundation for future development
of ERRα-based therapies for TNBC patients.

INTRODUCTION

ligand has yet to be defined, ERRα can modulate the
expression of transcriptomes of estrogen receptor (ER)
due to the high degree of structural similarity in the DNA
binding domain [2]. Given the established role of estrogen
in breast cancer, the roles of ERRα in ER signaling and
pathogenesis of breast cancer have been continuously

The estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), a

ERRα was correlate with increased risk of recurrence and
adverse clinical outcomes of breast cancer patients via a ER
status independent manner [3, 4]. The ChIP-chip analyses
of breast cancer cells revealed that majority of the genes
regulated by ERRα are distinct from those controlled by
ER [5, 6]. Further, high ERRα expression has been reported
in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, which is correlated
with poor prognosis [3, 7]. ERRα is also involved in
angiogenesis and response to hypoxia of solid tumors [8, 9].
These rapidly accumulating evidences suggest that ERRα
emerges as a transcriptional metabolic regulator that also
promotes cancer development [10, 11].
Triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which
is clinically defined by the absence of ER, ​progesterone
receptor (PR), or human ​epidermal growth factor receptor 2
(​HER2), accounts for about 15~20% of all newly diagnosed
breast cancer cases [12]. TNBC is generally associated with
high risk of disease recurrence and increased risk of visceral
and cerebral metastases compared with other subtypes of
breast cancer [13–15]. Further, patients are not eligible
for endocrine or HER2 targeted therapies, thus rendering
chemotherapy the only therapeutic option [16, 17].
The rate of death in patients with TNBC at 5 years is twice
that of ERα positive tumors [18]. Considering there is no
FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved targeted
therapy for TNBC patients, the investigation of underlying
molecular mechanisms and exploitation of new targeted
approaches are desperately needed.
ERRα is required for the growth and migration of
breast cancer cells when assayed in vitro or propagated
as xenografts [3, 7, 8, 19]. Our recent study revealed
inhibition of ERRα can suppress the metastasis of TNBC
cells via directly targeting fibronectin [20]. Further, ERRα
expression indicates worse prognosis and correlated with
poor outcome predictors in TNBC patients [21]. While
the roles and mechanisms of ERRα in the progression and
growth of TNBC remain unclear. XCT 790, which binds to
the inferred ligand-binding domain of ERRα, is the selective
inhibitor of ERRα. It has been widely used to investigate
the biological effects of ERRα [20, 22, 23]. The primary
objective of the present study is to illustrate the effects and
related mechanisms of ERRα on the in vitro and in vivo
growth of TNBC.

dependent manner. The IC50 values of XCT-790 (48 h) to
MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were 13.7 and 13.3 μM,
respectively. Therefore 5 μM XCT-790 was chose for
further studies on the basis of cytotoxicity test and other
previous studies [5, 7]. To validate the essential roles
of ERRα for XCT-790 induced suppression of TNBC
cell proliferation, MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells were
transfected with non-targeting control si-RNA or si-ERRα
for 24 h. Western blot analysis revealed that the expression
of ERRα was significantly silenced by si-ERRα while
not XCT-790 (Figure 1B). The silencing of ERRα also
suppressed the growth of both MDA-MB-231 and BT-549
cells (Figure 1C).
Whether XCT-790 blocked cells in a specific phase
of cell cycle was further determined. We synchronized
cells using double TdR-blocking method. Flow cytometry
(FCM) analysis showed an obvious decrease in the
percentage of cells in G2/M phase of XCT-790 treated
MDA-MB-231 cells, as compared with that in DMSO
(0.5%, v/v) treated control cells. The decrease of G2/M
phases by XCT-790 lasted throughout 48 h treatment
period (Figure 1D). Similar XCT-790 induced G2/M
phase decrease was also observed in BT-549 cells
(Data not shown). Collectively, these data revealed that
inhibition of XCT-790 by XCT-790 can significantly
inhibit the in vitro growth of TNBC cells by decreasing
G2/M phases.

XCT-790 induces mitochondrial-related
apoptosis
Next, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with
10 μM XCT-790 for increased time periods, and then
apoptotic cells were detected by FCM. As shown
in Figure 2A, XCT-790 treatment resulted in a
marked time dependent increase in apoptosis of
MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, the mitochondrial
membrane potential (ΔΨm) was measured using
fluorochrome dye JC-1. Our results showed that
XCT-790 treatment also resulted in a time dependent
increase in the ratio of the green fluorescence to red
fluorescence (Figure 2B), suggesting that inhibition
of ERRα can decrease the ΔΨm and thus promote cell
apoptosis. The expression levels of apoptotic related
proteins in TNBC cells were further measured. As
shown in Figure 2C, inhibition of ERRα significantly
(p < 0.05) up regulated the expression of Bax, Bim
and cleaved caspase-3 while down regulated the
expression of Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 in both MDAMB-231 and BT-549 cells, which led to an decrease
of antiapoptotic/proapoptotic Bcl-2/Bax ratios
(Figure S1). Collectively, these data suggested that
the mitochondrial-related apoptosis is involved in
XCT-790 induced TNBC cell growth arrest.

RESULTS
XCT-790 inhibits the proliferation and induces
cell cycle arrest of TNBC cells
Our recent study revealed that ERRα was highly
detected in TNBC MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 cells [20].
Then roles of ERRα inverse agonist XCT-790 on cell
viability were further investigated. As shown in Figure 1A,
XCT-790 treatment inhibited the proliferation of both

in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 3A). We analyzed the
expression of relevant antioxidant enzymes such as SOD,
GXP1 or catalase and ROS generation enzymes including
NOX1 and NOX4 [26]. As shown in Figure 3B, XCT-790
obviously decreased the mRNA expression of SOD1 and
SOD2 while not GXP1, catalase, NOX1, or NOX4. This
was confirmed by the results that catalase (H2O2 scavenger)

ROS generation is involved in XCT-790-induced apoptosis,
we measured the levels of ROS in XCT-790 treated cells

increase the ROS generation via a does dependent manner

Therefore, our results revealed that XCT-790 increases
ROS generation mainly by suppressing SOD1/2 expression.

ER stress-related proteins such as activating transcription
factor 4 (ATF4), activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6),
X-box binding proteins 1 (XBP-1), and C/EBP-homologous
protein (CHOP) in XCT-790-treated TNBC cells. The
results indicated that the protein levels of ATF4, ATF6,
XBP-1, and CHOP were obviously increased after treatment
for 12 h. The up regulation of these proteins can last more
than 48 h in both MDA-MB-231 (Figure 4A) and BT-549
(Figure 4B) cells. Furthermore, si-ERRα also obviously
increased the expression of ATF4, ATF6, XBP-1, and CHOP

In addition to mitochondrial pathway, ER stress
also plays an important role in cancer cell growth arrest
and apoptosis [27, 28]. We examined the expressions of

in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 4C). These data suggested
that ER stress is involved in XCT-790 induced growth arrest
of TNBC cells.

XCT-790 induced ROS generation in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 6A). NAC also alleviated the inhibition effects of
XCT-790 on the proliferation effects of MDA-MB-231 and
BT-549 cells (Figure 6B). We also examined the effects
of NAC on XCT-790 induced variation of growth arrest,
apoptosis, and ER stress related proteins. Our results
revealed that NAC obviously attenuated XCT-790 induced
down regulation of Bcl-2 and up regulation of Bax, Bims,
ATF-4, XBP-1, CHOP, p21 and p27 (Figure 6C and 6D).
The results suggested that ROS is involved in XCT-790
induced ER stress and growth arrest.

XCT-790 increases the expression of growth
inhibition related proteins
Proteins such as p53, p21 and c-Myc have been
implicated in apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction. We
thus examined the effects of XCT-790 on the expression
of these proteins. We found that XCT-790 can increase the
protein levels of p53 and p21 via both time (Figure 5A)
and concentration (Figure 5B) dependent manners. Further,
XCT-790 treatment also significantly (p < 0.05) increased
the levels of p-Ser15-p53 via a concentration dependent
manner (Figure 5C), which is essential for translocation of
p53 to the nucleus [29]. These results clearly demonstrated
that XCT-790 can impair growth and induce apoptosis via
up-regulation of apoptotic proteins in TNBC cells.

XCT-790 activates MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-κB
signals via ROS dependent or independent
manner
We next sought to identify the signal transduction
pathways involved in proliferation inhibition in response to
XCT-790 treatment. We monitored the expression levels and
activation statuses of MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB, which
have been implicated in cell proliferation and apoptosis
[30, 31]. As shown in Figure 7A–7C, XCT-790 treatment
rapidly activated (1 min) JNK and lasted for 60 min. For
IκBα, XCT-790 activated it since 1 min and lasted for 4 h.
As to p38-MAPK, XCT-790 activated it at 2 min and lasted
for more than 24 h. As to ERK1/2, Akt, and p65, XCT-790

ROS is involved in XCT-790 induced ER stress

We then assessed the roles of ROS generation in
XCT-790 induced ER stress and growth arrest. Our results
revealed that ROS scavenger NAC markedly attenuated

activated them since 5 min and also lasted for more than
24 h. While XCT-790 treatment had no obvious effect on the
total levels of ERK1/2, p38-MAPK, JNK, Akt, p65 or IκBα
for 0 to 24 h (Figure S2). In addition, our results confirmed
that XCT-790 treatment increased the transcription activities
of NF-κB in MDA-MB-231 cells by use of dual luciferase
reporter assay (Figure S3). Furthermore, the ROS scavenger
NAC significantly attenuated XCT-790 induced activation
of ERK1/2, p-38 MAPK, and Akt, while not JNK, p65, or
IκBα. It suggested that XCT-790 can activate the ERK1/2,
p-38 MAPK and Akt via ROS dependently and JNK, NFκB via ROS independently.

showed that the inhibitor of JNK and NF-κB, while not
others, significantly alleviated the inhibition effects of XCT790 on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8B),
while the inhibitor alone had no significant effect on cell
proliferation (Figure S4). This was further confirmed by
the results that SP and BAY attenuated the suppression
effects of si-ERRα on the proliferation of MDA-MB-231
cells (Figure 8C). Further, the inhibitor of JNK and NFκB also attenuated the down regulation of Bcl-2 and up
regulation of p53 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure 8D). The
results of cell viability revealed that p38-MAPK and NFκB are involved in XCT-790 induced ROS generation and
cell growth arrest, furthermore, ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt also
participate in XCT-790 induced ROS generation.

DISCUSSION

began to form measurable tumors after 14 days. After 35
days, all mice were sacrificed due to the large volume
of tumor in the control group. During all the processes
of experiments, the average size of tumor in XCT-790
groups was significantly (p < 0.05) less than that of control
ones (Figure 9A). At the end of the experiment, the volume
of control group (941 ± 154 mm3) was significantly
greater than that in XCT-790 group (292 ± 87.1 mm3).
This indicated that XCT-790 is able to inhibit the in vivo
growth of TNBC cells. Western blot analysis showed that
XCT-790 treatment significantly enhanced the expression
of apoptosis related proteins p-p53, p53, p27, p21, ER stress
related proteins XBP, ATF-4/6, XBP, CHOP, and activated
the signal molecules IκBα, p38-MAPK, Akt, and ERK, while
decreased the expression of ERRα and Bcl-2 (Figure 9C).
These data suggested that XCT-790 can inhibit the growth
of TNBC in nude mice bearing MDA-MB-231 xenografts
via proliferation suppression and apoptosis induction.

ERRα has been suggested to be a key factor for energy
metabolism and progression of various cancers [3, 7].
Herein, we provide new insights into the protumorigenic
action of ERRα on the progression of TNBC, an aggressive
and deadly type of cancer threatening patients all over the
world. Using the specific inverse agonist of ERRα, we
demonstrate that XCT-790 suppresses the proliferation,
decreases G2/M phases, and induces mitochondrial-related
apoptosis of TNBC cells. Further, XCT-790 also increases
the expression of ER-stress and growth inhibition related
proteins and induces the ROS generation mainly through
suppression of SOD1/2. Our data also show that the ROS
generation mediates XCT-790 induced ER-stress and
growth arrest. Multiple signal pathways, such as AKT/ROS
and ERK/ROS positive feedback loops, NF-κB/ROS, and
ROS/p38-MAPK, participate XCT-790 induced growth

arrest. In MDA-MB-231 tumor xenografts in nude mice,
XCT-790 treatment can significantly delay the in vivo
growth of TNBC cells.
ERRα has been suggested to be correlated with
unfavorable outcome in various cancer types such as
prostate, colorectal, cervical and ovarian carcinomas
[10, 11]. As to the breast cancer, high ERRα expression has
been found to correlate with poor clinical outcome and/
or unfavorable biomarkers such as ErbB2 [4, 5]. While
ERRα deficiency significantly delays tumor formation in a
mouse model of ErbB2-induced mammary tumorigenesis
[32]. Our study reveals that inhibition of ERRα by its
specific inverse agonist XCT-790 significantly inhibits the
in vitro and in vivo growth of TNBC cells. It is consistent
with previous study that inhibition of ERRα by its specific
siRNA or XCT-790 can suppress the growth of colon [33],
prostate [7], and estrogen receptor positive or negative
breast [19, 34] cancer cells. Furthermore, our previous
and others’ studies indicated the inhibition of ERRα can
also suppress the migration and invasion of cancer cells
via suppression the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
[20, 35], down regulation the stability of RHOA [36] or
induction the expression of WNT11 [37]. Collectively,
these data suggested that ERRα plays a positive role in
the progression of TNBC, while its inhibition might be a
potential valuable approach for TNBC treatment.
Our study suggests that ROS serves as a critical role
in XCT-790 induced growth arrest and ER stress of TNBC
cells. First, XCT-790 induces ROS production in TNBC
cells via a concentration dependent manner. Second, ROS
scavenger is able to suppress ROS production. Third, ROS
scavenger can attenuate XCT-790 induced down regulation
of Bcl-2 and up regulation of ER stress and apoptotic
related proteins. Fourth, ROS scavenger abolishes XCT790 induced growth arrest in vitro. The elevation of ROS
can be utilized to suppress cancer cell population growth
and even induce apoptosis [24, 25]. Previous studies
revealed that ERRα is essential for mitochondrial function
and the expression of antioxidant protection genes [38].

XCT-790 can arrest A549 lung cancer cell population
growth by inducing mitochondrial ROS production [39].
Considering that cancer cells are more sensitive to rapid
increases of ROS levels than normal cells [40], our study
provides a plausible mechanistic explanation for that
targeted inhibition of ERRα to suppress the progression
of TNBC via a ROS-dependent manner, which will
selectively kill cancer cells without causing significant
toxicity to normal cells [41]. Further, our results, together
with other previous studies, suggested that ERRα inverse
agonist would potentially have therapeutic value as novel
chemotherapeutics for treating TNBC [19, 20, 39].
The role of ER stress in ROS-induced apoptosis
has been demonstrated in a variety of cell types [27, 28].
As the results of oxidative stress mediated by ROS,
accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins triggers
a cellular adaptive procedure known as ER stress. Among
the ER-stress related proteins, ATF4, ATF6, XBP-1, and
CHOP are typical ER stress-regulated proteins involved
in ER stress-induced apoptosis [42, 43]. Our result reveal
that XCT-790 can up regulate the expression of ATF4,
ATF6, XBP-1, and CHOP for more than 48 h in TNBC
cells. The persistent or excessive ER stress inducing
irreversible damages to cells is favorable to the activation
of apoptosis [44]. Further, the ROS scavenger significantly
attenuates XCT-790 induced ER-stress of TNBC cells,
suggesting that ROS acts as upstream signals to initiate
XCT-790-induced ER stress [45]. Collectively, our data
reveal that XCT-790 induced ER stress is another pathway
responsible for its inhibition effects on TNBC progression.
We then try to probe the mechanism for ROS
generation and ant-cancer effects of XCT-790. We find that
XCT-790 can significantly suppress the mRNA expression
of SOD1/2, while not GXP1, Catalase, or NOX1/4. In the
present study, neither DPI (NOX inhibitor) nor Catalase
treatment can suppress XCT-790 induced ROS production,
suggesting that NOX or Catalase might not be involved
in XCT-790 induced ROS generation. As an important
antioxidant enzyme, SOD1/2 plays a critical role in the

reduction of intracellular oxidative stress [46]. Therefore,
our study suggests that XCT-790 induced ROS generation
mainly through suppression of SOD1/2.
Multiple signaling molecules, such as MAPKs,
PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB, have been shown to regulate the
generation of ROS [47]. Further, ROS functions as second
messengers in diverse signaling pathways [48]. The
MAPKs, including ERK1/2, JNK and p38 MAPK, are a
family of serine/threonine kinases that regulate a variety
of cellular events such as proliferation and apoptosis
[30, 31]. It is well known that activation of JNK contributes
to stress-induced apoptosis [49]. Here we find that XCT-790
can activate ERK1/2, p38α, and JNK1/2, but activation
of p38α was not responsible for XCT-790 induced ROS
generation. This is strongly supported by the findings that
inhibition of JNK with SP600125 or ERK1/2 with PD98059
abolished XCT-790 induced ROS generation. Further, our
study shows that pre-treatment with NAC prevented XCT790 induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38-MAPK,
while not JNK, indicating that ROS/ERK1/2 positive
feedback, JNK/ROS, and ROS/p38-MAPK are involved
in XCT-790 induced growth arrest of TNBC cells. Our
previous study also revealed that sustained activation of
ERK1/2 can suppress the proliferation and in vivo growth
of breast cancer cells [50]. Further research is needed to
address whether ERK and JNK induces ROS generation is
responsible for the activation of p38-MAPK.

Our study reveals that ROS/Akt feedback loop and
NF-κB/ROS pathway are also involved in XCT-790 induced
ROS generation. Mounting evidences suggest that PI3K/
Akt mediates the increase of ROS [51]. ROS scavenger
NAC is able to suppress XCT-790 induced activation of Akt
in MDA-MB-231 cells. Further, results show that XCT-790
rapidly (less than 1 min) induced IκBα phosphorylation,
which is concomitant with IκB degradation, p65
phosphorylation and p65 nuclear translocation. Inhibition
the activities of NF-κB and Akt significantly abolish
XCT-790 induced ROS generation. Previous findings
suggested dual roles for NF-κB signal transduction pathway
in the regulation of cell growth. Paradoxically NF-κB has
been known to be activated by various chemotherapeutic
agents that induce growth arrest [52, 53], which is consistent
with our present study. The activation of ROS/Akt signaling
cascade is also required for chemotherapeutic agents
induced growth and apoptosis [54]. Activated AKT serves
as an upstream signaling molecule for NF-κB through IκBα
kinase (IKK) and IκBα [55]. The relationship and cross
talks between NF-κB and PI3K/Akt in XCT-790 induced
ROS generation need further study.
In summary, the ensemble of evidence presented
in the current study demonstrates that the inverse agonist
of ERRα can suppress the in vitro and in vivo growth
of TNBC cells via elevation of ROS generation as
summarized in Figure 10. Further, XCT-790 can induce

mitochondrial-related apoptosis, increase the expression
of various proteins involved in growth inhibition, and
cause ER-stress of TNBC cells. Multiple signal pathways
including AKT/ROS and ERK/ROS positive feedback
loops, NF-κB/ROS, and ROS/p38-MAPK, participate
the inhibition effects of XCT-790 on TNBC progression.
However, the relationship and cross talks between these
signal pathways warrant further study. Considering that
there is no efficiency therapy target for TNBC until now,
the present study not only strongly suggests that ERRα
can be considered as a potential important target but also
provides XCT-790 as a drug candidate for TNBC therapy.

50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated using
GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA).

Analysis of cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial
membrane potential (∆Ψm), and reactive oxygen
species (ROS)
The assays of cell cycle, apoptosis, ∆Ψm, and ROS
were conducted as our previous methods [50]. Briefly, for
cell cycle analysis, cells were synchronized at the G1/S
transition by a double TdR block, as follows: 16 h block
with 2.5 μM TdR (Sigma), 10 h release followed by the
second block for 16 h. Then cells were treated with or
without XCT-790, washed with PBS, fixed with 70%
ethanol overnight at 4°C, incubated with propidium iodide
(50 μg/mL), and analyzed by a Coulter Epics XL Flow
Cytometry System (Beckman-Coulter, Miami, USA). For
cell apoptosis analysis, both the suspension and the adherent
cells were collected after XCT-790 treatment, stained with
Annexin V-FITC for 15 min and propidium iodide (PI)
for 5 min, and analyzed immediately by flow cytometry
using FL1 (Em: 525 nm) and FL3 (Em: 670 nm). For ∆Ψm
measurement, JC-1 staining solution (5 μg/ml) was added
to XCT-790 treated cells at 37°C for 20 min. After washed
with PBS twice, mitochondrial membrane potentials were
monitored by determining the relative amounts of dual
emission from a multiple fluorescence reader. Reactive
oxygen species (ROS) were monitored with the oxidation
sensitive fluorescent probe 2′,7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein
diacetate (DCF-DA).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents
PD 98059 (PD, ERK1/2 inhibitor), SP600125 (SP,
JNK inhibitor), SB203580 (SB, p38-MAPK inhibitor),
LY294002 (LY, PI3K/Akt inhibitor), BAY11-7082 (BAY,
NF-κB inhibitor) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St
Louis, Mo., USA). XCT-790 (specific inverse agonist of
ERRα) and other chemicals were of reagent grade or better
and purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO,
USA) unless otherwise noted. Monoclonal antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology Inc. (Beverly,
MA, USA) except the p-Akt and Akt, which were purchased
from Bioworld Technology Inc (Minneapolis, MN, USA).
Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody
was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz,
CA, USA). All compounds were solubilized in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO). Steroid-free medium containing DMSO
(0.5% v/v) was used as the control.

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)

Cell lines and culture

Total mRNA of cells were extracted with TRIZOL
reagent. First strand of cDNA was generated from 2  μg
total RNA using oligo-dT primer and Superscript II
Reverse Transcriptase (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, NY,
USA). qRT-PCR was run on an iCycler (Bio-rad, Hercules,
USA) using validated primers and SYBR Premix Ex Taq II
(Takara, Japan) for detection. The cycle number when the
fluorescence first reached a preset threshold (Ct) was used
to quantify the initial concentration of individual templates
for expression of mRNA of genes of interest. Transcripts
of the housekeeping gene GAPDH in the same incubations
were used for internal normalization. Primer pairs were as
follows: SOD1, forward 5′- GCA ATG TGA CTG CTG
ACA AAG AT-3′ and reverse 5′-ATT ACA CCA CAA GCC
AAA CGA CT-3′; SOD2, forward 5′- TGG ACA AAC CTC

TNBC cell MDA-MB-231 and BT-549 were
purchased from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA, USA) and cultured in RPMI medium
1640 (Invitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal Bovin serum,
100 U/ml penicillin, and 10 μg/ml streptomycin at 37°C
in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. An ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer
(Applied Biosystems) was used for the profiling. The DNA
profile data were cross-checked with the ATCC data bank.
Medium was replaced with phenol red-free medium 24 h
before experiments to remove the estrogen-like activity of
phenol red.

Cell viability assay
Proliferation and viability of cells were detected by
use of previously described procedures [56, 57]. Briefly,
cell viability was evaluated by use of the CCK-8 kit
(Dojindo Molecular Technologies, Gaithers burg, MD,
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The

Nude mice were purchased from the Sun Yat-sen
University (Guangzhou, China) Animal Center and raised
under pathogen-free conditions. All animal studies were
conducted in accordance with institutional guidelines for
the care and use of experimental animals. MDA-MB-231
cells (2 × 106 per mouse) were injected subcutaneously into
the fourth right mammary fat pad at the base of the nipple
of nude mice with 50% Matrigel (BD bioscience, Bedford,
MA). When the tumor was visible (14 days post injection of
tumor cells), all mice were randomly divided into XCT-790
and control group (n = 8 for each group). Mice of XCT-790
group were treated with XCT-790 (2 mg per kg, body
weight) by tail vein injection for every three days (Six times
together). Control group was treated with an equal volume
of vehicle. Tumor growth and body weight were monitored
every three days. The tumor volume was calculated using
the formula V = 1/2 × larger diameter × (smaller diameter)2.
When tumor volume at the control group reached
approximate 1000 mm3 (35 days post injection of tumor
cells), the animals were sacrificed, and the tumors were
removed and weighed for Western blot analysis.
