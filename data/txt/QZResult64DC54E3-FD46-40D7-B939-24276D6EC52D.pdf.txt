ABSTRACT
Mice with heterozygous loss of the tumor suppressor Patched1 (Ptch) develop
rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)-like tumors. However, Ptch transcripts are consistently
overexpressed in these tumors. We have recently shown that the upregulated
transcripts are derived from the mutated Ptch allele thus leading to the hypothesis
that the wild-type allele is repressed during RMS development. Here we describe
epigenetic changes taking place at the Ptch locus during RMS development. We showed
a lower degree of DNA-methylation in methylation-sensitive CpG regions of the Ptch
promoter in RMS compared to normal muscle from heterozygous Ptch animals. In
agreement with these results, treatment of heterozygous Ptch mice with the DNA
demethylating agent 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC) between embryonic days
E9.5–E11.5 significantly accelerated RMS formation. Since Ptch promoter methylation
occurs after/around E13.5, the window for RMS initiation during embryogenesis,
these results provide additional evidence that Ptch promoter hypomethylation may
contribute to RMS formation. We have also demonstrated increased trimethylation
of histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and preferential binding of Gli1, a known Ptch
activator, to the mutant locus in RMS. Together, these findings support an alternative
model for RMS formation in heterozygous Ptch mice including loss of methylation and
concomitant occupancy by activating histone marks of mutant Ptch.

This is characterized by increased levels of Gli1 mRNA
(reviewed in Hooper et al. [1]). Since the Ptch promoter
contains Gli-binding sites, activation of the Hh pathway is
also followed by Ptch transcription [2, 3].
Inactivating Ptch mutations have been identified
in various tumors including basal cell carcinoma,
medulloblastoma and RMS [4–6] thus supporting a
role for Ptch as a tumor suppressor gene. However,
one normal allele is frequently retained in the tumors
[7–9]. Using heterozygous Ptch knockout mice we
demonstrated that the wildtype (wt) and mutated Ptch
alleles are differentially expressed in RMS. Interestingly,
the Ptch transcripts consistently overexpressed in RMS are

INTRODUCTION
Hedgehog (Hh) proteins signal via two
multitransmembrane proteins, Ptch and Smoothened
(Smo). In this receptor complex, Ptch is the ligandbinding subunit and Smo is the signaling component.
Upon binding of Hh to its receptor Ptch, an inhibitory
effect of Ptch on Smo is released, allowing Smo to trigger
a signaling cascade activating the Gli transcription factors
(Gli1, 2 and 3), essential effectors for Hh-mediated cellular
effects. Due to its repressive function in the Hh pathway,
inactivation of Ptch results in pathological activation of
Hh signaling that in turn promotes tumor development.

derived predominantly from the mutated allele, whereas
transcript levels of the wt allele appear to be unchanged
or even downregulated [10–12]. These observations led to
the hypothesis that RMS formation in heterozygous Ptch
knockout mice is associated with epigenetic mechanisms
differentially repressing mutant and wt Ptch alleles.
Since DNA methylation is one of the best
characterized epigenetic modifications contributing to
the repression of genes with tumor suppressor activity
in tumors, we initially examined the levels of DNA
methylation at the Ptch promoter in RMS to compare the
DNA methylation status. We identified specific changes in
DNA methylation that are associated with transcriptional
activation of mutant Ptch in tumors. In addition, we
show an increased occupancy of activating histone marks
between normal and tumorigenic tissue of heterozygous
Ptch knockout mice as well as Gli1 binding to the mutant
Ptch allele. Finally, we monitored RMS formation in
heterozygous Ptch knockout mice that have been treated
with 5-aza-dC at the RMS-susceptible stage E9.5–E11.5
during embryogenesis. Moreover we analyzed the
methylation status of the Ptch promoter in mouse embryos
at E9.5 and E13.5 (i.e. the RMS-susceptible and RMSnon-susceptible stages, respectively [12]). Altogether, our
findings define a pattern of epigenetic changes associated
with differential expression of the mutant and wt allele and

provide foundation for future studies aimed at defining the
mechanism underlying the interplay between these marks
and Gli1 in RMS pathogenesis.

RESULTS
The mutant Ptch promotor is hypomethylated in
RMS from Ptch heterozygous mice
We recently showed that RMS of Ptch heterozygous
mice consistently overexpress the mutant Ptch allele
whereas the expression of the remaining wt Ptch allele is
unchanged or even repressed [11, 12 and Supplementary
Fig. S1]. Further in silico analysis identified a
methylation-sensitive region within the murine Ptch
promoter in RMS [11, Fig. 1] that suggests DNA
methylation as potential mediator of this phenomenon. We
next analyzed methylation of the Ptch promotor by MeDIP
using RMS and SM samples from 16 Ptchdel/+(Ptch+/–) [13]
and Ptchneo67/+ [14] mice. The total methylation content
was calculated as % input. As shown in Fig. 2A, 3 of
the 7 amplicons analyzed showed methylation, whereas
the remaining amplicons were unmethylated (data not
shown). Surprisingly, and in contrast to our previous
hypothesis, the methylation content in these fragments (i.e.
amplicon 3, 4 and 7 of the Ptch promoter) was reduced in

RMS compared to SM (Fig. 2A). Thus, the percentage of
methylation in SM in the amplicons 3, 4 and 7 decreased
from 32% to 20% (P = 0.0053), from 45% to 22%
(P = 0.0112) and from 1.1% to 0.5% (P = 0.0054) in RMS,
respectively. Although the decrease was small, especially
in fragment 7, the difference between SM and RMS was
statistically significant. For positive and negative controls
for the MeDIP see supplemental Fig. S2. Next, we used
bisulfite next generation sequencing (NGS) to validate
the above results. Due to the special requirements of
bisulfite specific primers, the amplicons differed slightly
from the MeDIP (as indicated in Figs. 2A and 2B). In
agreement with the MeDIP results, methylation was only
detected in the fragments 3, 4 and 7. Moreover we found a
highly significant decrease of methylation at several CpG
positions in RMS compared to SM (9/13 CpG positions
in fragment 3, 4/4 in fragment 4 and 2/17 in fragment 7).
As a control we analyzed two amplicons within the CpG
island A (see Fig. 1, Supplemental Table 1) close to the
Gli-binding site 1 and we were able to confirm the lack of
methylation in this region ([11] and data not shown).
We next sought to determine whether the methylated
or unmethylated amplicons in RMS were derived from the
transcriptionally repressed wt Ptch or the transcriptionally
active Ptch mutant allele, respectively (see also
supplemental Fig. S1). Allele-specific methylation
is a widespread phenomenon that also occurs tissuespecifically and can be identified by the presence of
specific Single Nucleotid Polymorphisms (SNPs) [15].
We therefore searched for SNPs in the amplicons 3, 4 and
7 (see Fig. 1) that would have allowed for discrimination
between the mutant and the wt Ptch alleles when breeding
Ptch+/– mice to another mouse strain. Unfortunately, no
informative SNPs within these amplicons were present
according to the Mouse Phenome Database and to our
bisulfite NGS analyses. We were therefore unable to
investigate allele specific methylation.

These data are consistent with ChIP-sequencing data for
H3K4me3 in C2C12 mouse myoblast cells and murine
ESC and together demonstrate an increased occupancy of
H3K4me3 on the Ptch promoter in RMS (Fig. 1). Next,
we determined what were the candidate mediators of these
changes in RMS and normal SM. Interestingly, there was
no significant changes between tumor and normal tissue
in enzymes writing or erasing H3K4 marks including
Kmt2a [17], Ash1l [18], Cxxc1 [19], Kdm1a [20] and
Ezh2 [21] (supplemental Fig. S4). However, the histone
deacetylases (Hdac) 1, 5–7 and 9–11 [22] as well as DNA
methyltransferases Dnmt1 and 3b [23] were significantly
increased in RMS compared to SM (Figs. 3A, 3B). The
high levels of Hdac1 and Dnmt1 in RMS were previously
reported to be induced by active Hh signaling [24, 25].
In contrast, the de novo DNA methyltransferase Dnmt3a
did not show aberrant expression in RMS although it was
reported to be regulated by Gli1 as well [25]. Together,
these data show increased levels of the active histone
modification H3K4me3 in the Ptch promotor in RMS
and increased expression of enzymes involved in DNA
methylation and histone deacetylation in the tumors.

RMS show higher binding of Gli1 at the mutant
Ptch promoter
To determine how the methylation differences
contributed to the differential transcriptional activity of the
Ptch alleles in RMS, we initially examined the binding
of Gli1, a known activator of Ptch in cancer, in SM and
RMS from 5 Ptch+/- mice and consecutively amplified
the fragments 1–4 and a 197 bp fragment covering the
polymorphism by qPCR (Supplemental Fig. S5 and data
not shown). For fragment 4 covering a Gli-binding site
(Gli-BS 2, Fig. 1) increased Gli1 binding was found in
RMS. A slight increase in RMS was also detected in
the neighboring fragment 3, whereas no difference was
detected for the other amplicons (Supplemental Fig. S5).
To determine if there were differences in the binding of
Gli1 between alleles we made use of the SNP rs29624336,
a genetic variant allowing to differentiate between the
genetic backgrounds 129Sv and Balb/c (C) and C57BL/6
(T) (supplemental Fig. S6). When crossing Ptch+/− mice
(on a Balb/c background) in which the vector used for the
propagation and original targeting was 129Sv [26] to wt
C57BL/6 mice, the mutant locus in the resulting Balb x
B6 Ptch+/– mice carries the C allele and the wt Ptch locus
the T allele. Due to the location of the SNP rs29624336
in vicinity to the Gli-binding sites indicated in Fig. 1
(~1.6 kb to Gli-BS 2 and ~2.6 kb to Gli-BS-3) this SNP
serves as excellent reference to determine if the level
binding of Gli1 was enhanced at the mutant locus. To this
end, we used 3 RMS from Balb x B6 Ptch+/− mice. DNA
was precipitated with the Gli1 antibody and after qPCR
was subcloned and sequenced. Indeed, although the results

Enhanced occupancy of the Ptch promoter by
activating H3K4me3 marks in RMS
We extended the promoter analysis and investigated
if changes in histone marks were accompanying the DNA
methylation patterns of the wt and mutant Ptch alleles.
Specifically, we examined the levels the trimethylation
of H3K4, a hallmark of unmethylated CpG islands
[16]. We immunoprecipitated H3K4me3-modified
chromatin and performed qPCR (supplemental Table 1,
for controls see supplemental Fig. S3). We found that the
Ptch promoter contained 4 regions that were occupied
by H3K4me3 in RMS, but not in SM derived from 4
Ptch heterozygous mice (Fig. 2C). Increased H3K4me3
enrichment was observed for amplicons 1, 2, 3 and 5.
The difference between RMS and SM was statistically
significant for amplicons 2 and 5 (both P = 0.0286).

allele and thus the mutant Ptch locus was more frequently
amplified than the T allele (together 83 C and 59 T). These
data show that Gli1 binding is higher at the mutant Ptch
allele. This together with hypomethylation of the mutant
Ptch alleles in RMS may explain the higher transcriptional
activity of the mutant Ptch allele.

palpable and histologically confirmed RMS (Fig. 4 and
Table 1). There were no differences in morphology or
differentiation between tumors. However, the 5-aza-dC
treatment significantly shortened RMS latency time. Thus,
the median RMS latency time of 5-aza-dC treated animals
was 50 days and that of untreated animals was 98 days
(P = 0.0012 for palpable RMS by Gehan-BreslowWilcoxon test). Together, these data suggest that
changes in DNA methylation controls RMS initiation
and progression. Furthermore, the 5-aza-dC treatment
resulted in an average number of tumors of 3.5 ± 0.49
(Table 1), while the average tumor number of untreated
mice was 2.6 ± 0.29 per animal (P = 0.217). Despite a
lack of significance these data show that 5-aza-dC, in
addition to shortening the latency time, may also increase
the multiplicity of RMS.
Since Ptch+/– mice are highly susceptible to RMS
formation at E9.5, whereas the susceptibility progressively
declines at later stages, we next hypothesized that the
Ptch promoter may show a different methylation pattern
at different developmental stages during embryogenesis.
To test this hypothesis we compared the methylation
status of the Ptch locus at the RMS-susceptible stage E9.5
with the RMS-non-susceptible stage E13.5. To this end
we analyzed the methylation-sensitive regions 3, 4 and 7
(see Fig. 1) in DNA from 30 E9.5 and 4 E13.5
wt embryos. As shown in Supplemental Fig. S7
almost no DNA methylation of the Ptch promoter was
detectable in E9.5 embryos. At E13.5 the methylation
increased and was significantly higher compared to E9.5
(P = 0.0238, P = 0.0159, P = 0.0333 for amplicons
3, 4 and 7, respectively; for control experiments see

5-aza-dC treatment during embryogenesis
accelerates RMS development in heterozygous
Ptch mice
Using a conditional knock-out strategy in Ptchflox/+
mice, we recently demonstrated that disruption of one
Ptch allele at embryonic day E9.5 in the mouse results
in RMS initiation in approximately 90% of mice. The
RMS susceptibility declines to 44% when Ptch is
disrupted at E11.5 and the window for RMS initiation
is closed at E13.5 during embryogenesis [12]. These
data suggest that epigenetic modifications at the Ptch
promoter repressing the wt allele while concomitantly
activating the mutant Ptch allele occur before day E13.5.
If hypomethylation of the Ptch promoter indeed plays a
role in RMS formation, global DNA demethylation by
5-aza-dC at the RMS-susceptible stage should either
influence onset, incidence or latency time of RMS in
Ptch+/– mice. To test this hypothesis, we mated female wt
mice to Ptch+/– males and treated the pregnant animals
with 5-aza-dC at 9.5, 10.5, and at 11.5 days post coitum
(dpc) (i.e. at the RMS-susceptible stages). At the end
of the study 92% and 95% of 5-aza-dC and untreated
animals, respectively, developed at least one visible or

supplemental Fig. S8). Together, these data show that the
Ptch promoter at the RMS-susceptible stage (i.e. at E9.5)
is marginally methylated and methylation increases at the
RMS-non-susceptible (i.e. at E13.5) stage. Along with
the observations that the 5-aza-dC-treatment at the RMSsusceptible stage accelerates RMS growth (i.e. 5-aza-dC
accelerated occurrence of palpable RMS) these data support
our notion that Ptch promoter hypomethylation is involved
in RMS formation.

hypermethylated regions frequently include promoter
regions of tumor suppressor genes [27].
In our study the promoter of the putative tumor
suppressor gene Ptch is hypomethylated in RMS
compared to SM in regions with only a moderate CpG
content. This fits to findings that DNA methylation is
usually associated with CpG-poor DNA, whereas CpG
islands remain mostly unmethylated [16]. In addition,
the Ptch promoter in RMS is furthermore occupied by
the activation-associated histone mark H3K4me3. Indeed
H3K4me3 is a hallmark of unmethlyated CpG islands
[28]. Accordingly, fragment 3 (see Figs. 1, 2) showed
both DNA methylation and H3K4me3 occupancy, and
the level of H3K4me3 signal correlated inversely with
the degree of DNA methylation. These data strongly
suggest that the Ptch promoter in RMS is activated
due to hypomethylation and increased occupancy of
activating histone marks. Interestingly accumulation of
H3K4me3 has been shown to be associated with strong
gene activation in tumor tissues even without changes
in DNA methylation levels [29]. This sheds light on the
promoter regions without methylation changes in RMS
and SM (fragments 1, 2 and 5) with increased H3K4me3

DISCUSSION
In this study we analyzed epigenetic modifications
at the Ptch promoter in RMS of heterozygous Ptch mice.
Since only the mutant Ptch transcript is overexpressed
in RMS we previously assumed that the tumor-initiating
event is active repression of the wt Ptch allele [11]. Indeed,
our previous data showed that 5-aza-dC-treatment of RMS
modulated methylation of Ptch upstream sequences. In
general, changes in the methylation pattern are a hallmark
of cancer cells. Whereas hypomethylated regions in
tumor cells usually comprise genes or structures that are
normally silent or interfere with chromosomal stability,

occupancy in RMS and supports our assumption that the
mutant Ptch promoter is activated in RMS by diverse
epigenetic mechanisms. Furthermore H3K4me3 protects
DNA from methylation [30]. Thus increased H3K4me3
occupancy of the mutant Ptch allele might contribute to
the pathological Ptch expression in RMS.
Hypomethylation of the Ptch promoter in RMS
is most likely established independently of the tumorspecific expression profile of epigenetic modifier enzymes,
because RMS i) generally express elevated levels of genes
involved in the establishment and maintenance of genomic
hypermethylation (i.e. HDACs and Dnmts; see Fig. 3) and
ii) do not exceedingly express genes associated with the
regulation of H3K4 methylation.
So far only a few studies analyzed Ptch promoter
methylation in cancer. Apparently the methylation
status varies significantly at different regions of the
Ptch promoter. As shown in Fig. 1 the Ptch promoter
contains  several alternative first exons. Lack of
methylation at the alternative exon 1B was reported for
human medulloblastoma [31, 32] whereas others showed
methylation in exon 1A [33]. Methylation of exon 1A was
also found in gastric cancer samples [34] and exon 1B was
methylated in fibroma and dermoids [35], in basal cell
carcinoma [36] but not in squamous cell cervical cancer or
ovarian cancer [37]. Moreover it was reported that the Ptch
promoter in medulloblastoma from Ptch heterozygous
mice is not methylated [38]. Since our previous studies
did not reveal methylation near the Gli-binding site 1 in
the murine Ptch promoter [11], we focused on the CpG
islands B-D (Fig. 1) and neighboring CpG rich regions.
Strikingly, the hypomethylated Ptch promoter regions in
RMS cover one of the three Gli-binding sites. Since loss
of Ptch function results in aberrant Hh signaling activity
that culminates in activation of Gli transcription factors,
hypomethylation of the Gli-binding site could explain the
very high Ptch transcripts levels in tumors of Ptch+/– mice.
These data support a new model of RMS formation
in Ptch+/– mice (Fig. 5). According to this model the Ptch

promoter becomes methylated and inactivated after E9.5
in the course of muscle development. This assumption is
supported by i) a lack of methylation of the methylationsensitive sites within the Ptch promoter at E9.5,
ii) an increase in methylation at E13.5 and iii) distinct
methylation of the methylation-sensitive sites in adult
SM. It is also fostered by the very low Ptch expression
in SM [11, 14, 39]. According to our new model a RMS
develops when methylation of the mutant Ptch locus
in a specific RMS precursor cell does not occur during
the RMS-susceptible state of embryogenesis (i.e. before
E13.5) which then results in increased Gli1 binding and
permanent Hh pathway activity.
The finding that 5-aza-dC treatment of E9.5 old
Ptch+/– embryos accelerates RMS growth also favors
this model of RMS formation. 5-aza-dC irreversibly
inhibits Dnmts. Whereas Dnmt1 is the primary enzyme
responsible for copying methylation patterns after DNA
replication, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are responsible for
de novo methylation of genes, also during mammalian
development [40, 41]. Indeed, de novo DNA methylation
in the embryo occurs between E4.5 and E13.5 [16]
and Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b are expressed ubiquitously
in the E9.5 old embryo [40]. Since the Ptch promoter
is unmethylated at the RMS-susceptible stage E9.5
(Supplemental Fig. S7) and since 5-aza-dC blocks both the
de novo and maintenance Dnmts [42], blockage of de novo
methylation of the Ptch promoter at E9.5 (by 5-aza-dC
treatment) appears to be responsible for maintaining the
mutant Ptch locus in an unmethylated state. If this occurs
in a RMS precursor cell, the pathological activation of Hh
signaling provides a proliferative advantage. In addition
to this mechanism, 5-aza-dC likely also affects other
DNA regions which may contribute to accelerated RMS
formation in Ptch+/– mice.
At first glance, our new model appears to conflict
with our recent observation that heterozygosity for
Dnmt1 delayed (instead of accelerated) the growth
of medulloblastoma in heterozygous Ptch mice.

Figure 5: Mechanism of RMS formation in heterozygous Ptch mice. Initially the Ptch promoter is not methylated during early

embryonic development allowing abundant expression (thick arrows) of wildtype (wt) and mutant (mut) Ptch transcripts in heterozygous
Ptch knockout mice. Subsequently methylation (resembled by lollipops) of the Ptch promoter starts at E13.5 or later during embryogenesis
leading to decreased Ptch expression of the methylated alleles (as indicated by thin arrows). If both Ptch alleles are methylated myogenesis
proceeds unperturbed and wt as well as mut Ptch are expressed at low levels during and after myogenesis (indicated by grey color). If the
mut allele remains accidentally unmethylated and Gli1 binding is increased, the cell of origin for RMS (single black cell) expresses high
levels of mut Ptch (indicated by black color) and finally gives rise to RMS (cluster of black cells) during adulthood.

Medulloblastoma formation in Ptch mutant mice follows
a similar molecular mechanism as RMS formation with
the mutant Ptch transcripts being highly overexpressed
and the wt transcripts underrepresented [11]. However,
since the reduction of Dnmt1 activity in heterozygous
Ptch mice did not affect initiation of medulloblastoma
[11] and since reduced levels of Dnmt1 activity can
inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis [43], it is
possible that the already initiated medulloblastoma simply
underwent pronounced apoptosis and thus stagnated in
their growth.
Furthermore, we showed that treatment with 5-aza-dC
of adult mice did not influence RMS growth [11]. This
indicates that 5-aza-dC-induced demethylation of the wt
Ptch locus in already established RMS precursor lesions in
the adult does not compensate for the overexpression of the
demethylated and thus overexpressed mutant Ptch allele.
The efficient prevention of RMS growth by 5-aza-dC
along with valproic acid in the adult animal [11] can be
explained either by a more efficient reactivation of wt
Ptch expression after combination therapy or by additional
Ptch-independent mechanisms.
In conclusion, our data suggest an alternative model
of tumor formation caused by the tumor suppressor
gene Ptch. This model includes loss of methylation and
occupancy by activating histone marks and probably
Gli1 binding of the mutant Ptch locus. In this model,
overexpression of the mutant, non-functional Ptch protein
results in aberrant Hh signaling activity and tumor
formation. Whether this model can also be applied to
human Ptch-associated tumors remains to be analyzed in
the future.

Balb x B6 Ptch+/– mice used for SNP analyses were
on a mixed Balb/cJ x C57BL/6 background. In these mice
the wt Ptch locus is derived from a C57BL/6 wt female
whereas the mutated Ptch locus is derived from a Ptch+/–
male on a Balb/cJ background.

females were mated to Ptch+/– males. The pregnant females
were injected intraperitoneally with 100 μg/kg of 5-aza-dC
(maximal tolerable dose; see Ecke et al. [11]) in PBS at
9.5, 10.5, and 11.5 dpc. For determination of embryonic
ages, noon on the day of the postcoital plug was taken
as E0.5.

Tumor monitoring and histological examination
RMS development in Ptch+/– mice was monitored
by weekly manual palpations of animals as most
RMS develop in the muscles of the hip/thigh or
intraabdominally. Tail deformation in some mice treated
with 5-aza-dC during embryogenesis indicated that
they were efficiently exposed to the substance during
embryogenesis [45, 46]. If possible, the observation period
encompassed 250 days. After death the animals were
examined for additional, non-visible and non-palpable
tumors. The identity of the tumors as RMS was confirmed
using paraffin sections stained with hematoxylin and
eosin.

DNA and RNA-isolation and qPCR
DNA was extracted according to standard
procedures. Total RNA was isolated using PeqGOLD
TriFast™ reagent (PeqLab, Erlangen, Germany). Reverse
transcription of total RNA was performed using random
hexamers and SuperScriptII reverse transcriptase
(Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany). qPCR was performed
on an ABI PRISM 7900HT Sequence Detection System
(Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, USA).
Amplification of 18s rRNA as an endogenous control was
performed to standardize the amount of sample RNA. All
primers and probes used in qPCR assays for analyses of
transcript expression were intron-flanking (supplemental
Table 1).
In order to distinguish between the wt Ptch and
mutant Ptch transcripts derived from Ptch+/- mice we
established a TaqMan assay using fluorogenic probes
that span exons 8 and 9 or exons 7 and 10, respectively
(supplemental Table 1).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Compounds
5-aza-dC (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany)
was diluted in PBS. Stocks of 120 μg/ml 5-aza-dC were
stored at −80°C and the required amount was diluted from
a new aliquot directly prior use.

Animals
Experiments using animals were performed with
consideration of all necessary legal requirements. Ptch+/–
mice, which served for treatment studies and tumor
monitoring, were on a Balb/cJ background that confers
RMS susceptibility [44]. In Ptch+/– mice exons 8 and 9
of the murine Ptch gene are replaced by a neo cassette.
Genotyping of the wt and the targeted Ptch alleles were
performed as described [13]. Some of the results were
confirmed in Ptchneo67/+ mice that lack Ptch exons 6 and 7
(for description of the mice and genotyping see Hahn
et al. [14]).

MeDIP
MeDIP was performed with phenol chloroform
extracted DNA from RMS and the corresponding SM from

9120

Oncotarget

Ptch+/- mice and from E9.5 and E13.5 mouse embryos. The
MagMeDIP kit (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) was used
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Efficiency of
DNA shearing (Bioruptor® NGS, Diagenode, high power,
5 cycles: 30 sec on/off) was analyzed by agarose gel
electrophoresis. MeDIP and input samples were analyzed
by qPCR and MeDIP samples were normalized to the
respective input. The results are shown as % input (ratio
signals in immunoprecipitated DNA versus input DNA).

high power, 30 cycles: 30 sec on/off) and insoluble
remains removed by centrifugation. Fifteen μl were
used for DNA isolation and quantification (NanoDrop
8000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts,
USA). DNA fragmentation was confirmed by agarose
gel electrophoresis. The chromatin was pre-cleared
(1 h, 4°C). One μg chromatin was mixed with 1 ml IP
buffer/ 1 μg anti-H3K4me3 or IgG control antibody (see
supplemental Table 3) and incubated at 4°C overnight. To
bind immunoprecipitated complexes protein A Sepharose
was used (2 h, 4°C). Thereafter samples were washed with
IP buffer/0.1% SDS, wash buffer, IP buffer/0.1% SDS and
TE. Then the immunoprecipitated complexes and input
samples (0.1 μg) were incubated with 10% chelex 100
(10 min, 95°C). Two μg proteinase K were added and
samples were heated to 55°C (30 min) and 95°C (10 min).
Samples were centrifuged and supernatants were used for
qPCR. Therefore all input samples were diluted 1:10 with
water. ChIP samples were normalized to their respective
input sample. The results are shown as % input.
The Gli1 ChIP was conducted using a modification
of the Magna ChIP kit protocol (EMD Millipore, Bedford,
MA). Defrosted SM and RMS tissue samples were sliced
with a scalpel blade, resuspended in PBS and fixed at
room temperature with 1% formaldehyde for 15 min. After
that, 10x glycine solution was added to quench unreacted
formaldehyde, samples were spinned down and washed
twice with PBS/proteases inhibitor cocktail (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). Samples were minced for 2 min
using the homogenizer, resuspended in cell lysis buffer,
kept on ice for 40–45 min and vortexed for 5 min. After
spinning down samples were resuspended in nuclear lysis
buffer, sonicated for 40–45 cycles and insoluble remains
were removed by centrifugation. The following steps were
the same as the ones from H3K4me3 ChIP.

Bisulfite next generation sequencing
Sodium bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA from
RMS and SM from 9 Ptch+/- mice was carried out using
the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Bisulfitetreated DNA was amplified with primers located in the
CpG island A (Fig. 1) and in fragments 3–7 specific
for bisulfite-treated DNA (see supplemental Table 1).
For primer design Methyl Primer Express Software
v1.0 (Applied Biosystems) was used. All gel extracted
amplicons (QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit, Qiagen) derived
from one RMS or SM tissue sample were pooled and
quantified using Quanti Flour (Promega, Fitchburg, WI,
USA). For each sample 1.2 μg DNA were diluted in 100 μl
tris/EDTA buffer and sonicated to 200 bp using the Nano
NGS-Bioruptor® (Diagenode). Library preparation was
performed using the TruSeq custom Amplicon Library
Preparation (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Library
sizes were evaluated using the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) and the quantity was
estimated using Quanti Flour. Libraries were diluted to
8 pM and sequenced with the MiSeq System (MS-102–3001,
Illumina) using the 300 cycle kit and v3 Reagents.
Bisulfite NGS data were analyzed with the
software Sequence Pilot Version 4.1.2 (JSI medical
systems, Ettenheim, Germany). Briefly, the sequences
(FASTQ files) were aligned to the bisulfite modified
reference sequence for each amplicon assuming all C in
a CpG position as methylated. The percentage of C to T
nucleotide changes compared to the reference sequence
was used to calculate the ratio of DNA methylation. The
percentage and coverage of C to T nucleotide changes for
all CpG in fragments 3, 4 and 7 are shown in supplemental
Table 4. The efficiency of bisulfite conversion was
estimated by the proportion of non-CpG cytosines
converted to uracil and was > 98% in all samples.

SNP analysis
After Gli1 ChIP and qPCR using primers
encompassing the SNP rs29624336 (Supplemental Table 1)
the amplicons were purified with the QIAquick Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy
(Promega). For each amplicon at least 40 clones were
sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. The sequences were
analyzed on the ABI 3500xL Genetic Analyzer (Applied
Biosystems) and the chromatograms were evaluated using
the software BioEdit version 7.1.3.0 [48].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
The H3K4me3 ChIP was essentially carried out
as described [47]. See supplemental Table 2 for buffers
and solutions. Briefly, RMS and SM were minced
and crosslinked. After washing (PBS) samples were
homogenized, dounced, sonicated (Bioruptor® Plus,

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Western blot
RMS and SM from 4 heterozygous Ptch mice
were homogenized in 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM Hepes,
1 mM EDTA at pH 7, supplemented with protease and
