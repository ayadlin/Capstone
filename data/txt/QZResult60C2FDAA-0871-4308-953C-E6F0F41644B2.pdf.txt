Abstract
P2 purinergic receptors are overexpressed in certain cancer tissues, but the
pathophysiologic relevance of purinergic signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
remains unknown. To examine the role of P2 purinergic signaling in the pathogenesis
of HCC and characterize extracellular nucleotide effects on HCC cell proliferation, two
independent HCC patient cohorts were analyzed for P2 purinergic receptor expression,
and nucleotide treated HCC cell lines were evaluated for effects on proliferation and
cell cycle progression. Our studies suggest that multiple P2 purinergic receptor
isoforms are overexpressed in liver tumors, as compared to uninvolved liver, and
dysregulation of P2 purinergic receptor expression is apparent in HCC cell lines, as
compared to human primary hepatocytes. High P2X3 purinergic receptor expression
is associated with poor recurrence-free survival (RFS), while high P2Y13 expression
is associated with improved RFS. Extracellular nucleotide treatment alone is sufficient
to induce cell cycle progression, via activation of JNK signaling, and extracellular ATPmediated activation of P2X3 receptors promotes proliferation in HCC cells. Conclusion:
Our analysis of HCC patient livers and HCC cells in vitro identifies a novel role for
dysregulation of P2 purinergic signaling in the induction of hyper-proliferative HCC
phenotype and identifies P2X3 purinergic receptors as potential new targets for
therapy.

rate of up to 70% at 5 years. OLT has a better prognosis,
however most patients are not suitable candidates and a
scarcity of organs contribute to longer wait times; more
than 16, 000 patients were on the wait list for livers in
2012 [5, 6]. Over 75% of HCC are caused by viral
infections such as Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and 70-90%
of all tumor development is associated with chronic liver
injury, inflammation and cirrhosis [3].
It is well established that liver injury with cellular
stress and inflammation is a potent trigger for ATP
release from hepatocytes and other liver cells [7-9].

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the second
leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide [1]. The
incidence and deaths resulting from HCC have steadily
increased in the US over the past three decades, and it is
predicted that they will continue to rise [2]. Currently, the
prognosis for HCC is dismal with overall survival rates of
3-7% [3, 4]. Treatment options for HCC are limited, with
liver resection or orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) as
the best approaches. Resection has a very high recurrence

Extracellular ATP via the activation of cell surface
P2 purinergic receptors influences cell proliferation,
differentiation and apoptosis [10]. We have previously
shown that extracellular ATP-mediated P2 purinergic
receptor activation promotes cell-cycle progression
and proliferation in rat primary hepatocytes via c-Jun
N-terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway in vitro and hepatocyte
proliferation in response to 70% partial hepatectomy in
vivo [11, 12]. Extracellular ATP-mediated activation of
P2X (ligand gated ion channels) and P2Y (G proteincoupled) receptors have been reported to influence cell
proliferation, migration or apoptosis of various cancer
cell types [10, 13-16]. Studies suggest that extracellular
ATP-mediated activation of P2Y2 receptor promotes
proliferation and migration in HCC cells[17]; however
the role of the remaining 14 P2 receptor isoforms in HCC
is currently unknown. ATP levels in the tumor interstitium
of mice was measured in the hundreds micro molar range
compared to near undetectable levels in healthy tissues
[18].
Ectonucleotidases such as CD39 decrease
extracellular nucleotide concentrations by hydrolyzing
nucleotides to nucleosides and ultimately adenosine
[19, 20]. Deletion of Cd39 in mice is shown to increase
hepatocyte proliferation and promote hepatocarcinogenesis
[20]. Furthermore, P2Y2 mRNA and protein expression
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

are increased in human HCC cells compared to normal
hepatocytes and others have shown that there is increased
P2Y2 and P2Y4 receptor expression in other cancers [17,
21, 22]. Recently, peritumoral P2X7 purinergic receptor
expression has been associated with poor survival in
HCC patients after surgical resection[23]. However, P2
purinergic receptor expression and its role in hepatocyte
cell cycle progression in human HCC remain unexplored.
The purpose of this study was to examine the role
of P2 purinergic signaling in the pathogenesis of HCC
in patients and characterize the influence of extracellular
nucleotides on HCC cell proliferation. Our analysis
reveals dysregulation of P2 purinergic receptor expression
in HCC tumors, as compared to the uninvolved area of the
same patient, and compared to normal livers. Increased
frequency of P2 purinergic receptor upregulation in
patients with HCV versus those with non-viral etiologies
identifies a unique subset of viral-induced HCC
overexpressing P2 purinergic receptors. We show that
P2X3 purinergic receptor overexpression is associated
with poor recurrence-free survival in patients with HCC.
Our in vitro findings suggest that nucleotide treatment
alone was sufficient to induce HCC cell proliferation,
and provide mechanistic insights into the potential role
of dysregulation of purinergic signaling in the induction
of hepatocyte cell-cycle control associated with HCC

than those patients with ‘low’ P2X3 receptor expression
(p = 0.0001). On the other hand, patients with high P2Y13
expression had significantly improved recurrence free
survival (p = 0.007) (Figure 1D). Recall that in the TMC
cohort P2X3 was observed as the receptor with the greatest
frequency of ‘high’ expression in HCC tumor samples
(60%) and P2Y13 was identified as the receptor with the
lowest frequency of ‘high’ expression (31%) (Figure 1D).
Corroborating our findings, Oncomine analysis
revealed that P2X3 mRNA is significantly overexpressed
in the Mas_Liver dataset (p = 9.23E-7), while P2Y13
mRNA is underexpressed in the Chen Liver dataset (p =
1.03E-14) (Suppl. Figure 1) [25, 26]. It is noteworthy that
P2X3 was ranked among the top 7% overexpressed genes
in the Mas_Liver dataset, which included exclusively
HCV-positive HCC samples and HCV-negative normal
livers. In the TMC cohort 43% of patients exhibited ‘low’
P2Y13 mRNA expression, which was ranked among the
top 4% underexpressed genes in Chen_Liver dataset,
and included HCC samples of viral and non-viral origin.
Dysregulation of P2X3 and P2Y13 mRNA expression
was evident in HCC livers, despite comparable DNA
copy numbers of these genes between HCC and normal in
the TCGA, Guichard_Liver and Guichard_Liver 2 DNA
datasets [24, 29].

Increased P2 purinergic receptor
expression in Human HCC livers

mRNA

To determine if P2 purinergic receptor expression is
dysregulated in HCC livers, we analyzed 42 pairs of HCC
livers (uninvolved vs. tumor) and 6 normal donor liver
samples from the TMC cohort. Twenty-one patients were
infected with Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), 5 patients with
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) and 10 patients with non-viral
etiologies. Information on the etiology was unavailable for
6 patients (Suppl. Table 1). Relative expression of all 15 P2
purinergic receptor isoforms was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
Multiple P2 purinergic receptor isoforms were elevated ≥
2-fold in liver tumors (‘high’ expression) as compared to
uninvolved areas of the liver (Table 1). Our results reveal
that 31% of patients in the TMC cohort exhibited ‘high’
expression of at least one P2 purinergic receptor isoform,
while 60% of patients exhibited ‘high’ P2X3 mRNA
expression in liver tumors, compared to their uninvolved
areas (Figure 1A). P2X3 protein overexpression was
observed in HCC tumors compared to uninvolved livers
by Western blotting of total homogenates (Fig 1B).
HepG2 cell total protein was used as a positive control.
Further validation was done by immunohistochemical
analysis of tumors, uninvolved areas of HCC patient
livers, and normal liver which revealed that P2X3 protein
overexpression was predominant in hepatocytes (Figure
1C). P2 purinergic receptor mRNA expression was
significantly elevated in HCC tumors, as compared to
uninvolved areas; despite apparent dysregulation of P2
purinergic receptor expression in the uninvolved areas of
most of the patient livers, as compared to normal livers
(Table 1). These findings suggest that dysregulation of P2
purinergic receptor expression in chronic liver injury may
precede HCC development.

P2 purinergic receptor upregulation is more
frequent in HCV patients
In order to gain insight into the etiology of HCC
and its influence on P2 purinergic receptor overexpression
in HCC livers, we stratified our TMC patients based
on their history of viral infection and found that P2
purinergic receptor upregulation, as assessed by qRTPCR was more prevalent among those patients infected
with HCV, as compared to non-viral groups (Figure
1E). P2X3 overexpression is evident in 75% of HCV
patients as compared to only 30% of non-viral patients.
Immunohistochemical analysis of patient livers with
HBV (patient # 30), HCV (patient # 29, 32, 36) and non
viral patients (patient # 16, 28, 50) indicates that P2X3
overexpression in HCC tumors as compared to uninvolved
livers can be detected in HCC livers, irrespective of
etiology (Figure 1C & Suppl. Figure 2).
To determine whether viral infection influences
recurrence free survival, Kaplan-Maier analysis was
done on the Korean cohort. Patients were stratified as
HBV positive or negative AND P2X3 ‘high’ or ‘low’ as
previously defined. Regardless of HBV status, patients
with ‘high’ P2X3 expression had lower RFS than patients
with ‘low’ P2X3 expression (Figure 1F). Among HBV
positive patients, those with high P2X3 expression had
significantly lower RFS compared to those with low
P2X3 expression (Suppl. Figure 3A). While there was a
considerable difference in median survival between P2X3

P2 purinergic receptor expression correlates with
HCC patient survival
The upregulation of multiple P2 purinergic receptor
isoforms observed in HCC prompted us to question the
significance of dysregulation of P2 purinergic receptor
expression on HCC survival in a larger Korean cohort (188
patients). Demographic and pathologic features of this
Korean cohort are presented in Suppl. Table 2. Patients
were stratified according to ‘high’ (above median) and
‘low’ (below median) P2 purinergic receptor expression
based on microarray gene expression analysis of resected
livers. Patients with ‘high’ P2X3 expression had a
significantly lower recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate

high (33 months) and P2X3 low (67 months) among
HBV viral patients, there was no statistically significant
difference in RFS between the two, likely due to small
sample size (25 patients) (Suppl. Figure 3B). To determine
whether the impact of P2X3 overexpression on risk of
recurrence was dependent of HBV status Cox proportional
hazard model analysis was performed. Our data reveals
that there was no significant interaction between P2X3
expression and HBV status (p = 0.90), confirming that the
effect of P2X3 high expression on the risk of recurrence
does not significantly differ across HBV groups.

(Figure 3B). In human hepatocytes, ATP treatment (18h)
led to a modest increase in cell proliferation and viability
(27%) while ATPγS treatment (18h) was more potent
(64%) (Figure 3C).
Nucleotide treatment resulted in increased cyclin
D3, cyclin E, cyclin A and cyclin B mRNA expression,
correlating with increased proliferation (Figure 3D).
Cyclin D3 mRNA expression was observed after 6h
(ATPγS - 2.1 fold), 12h (ATPγS - 1.8 fold; ADP - 2.7
fold), 24h (ATPγS - 3.4 fold; ADP - 4.5 fold), 36h
(ATPγS - 3.5 fold; ADP - 2.8 fold) and 48h (ADP - 2.4
fold) treatment, as compared to untreated cells (Figure
3E). Cyclin E expression exhibited a similar profile while
cyclin B expression was induced later at 36h and 48h after
treatment (Figure 3E). Western blotting of Huh7 cell total
lysates revealed that ATPγS treatment (18h, 24h, 30h)
alone was sufficient to induce cyclin D3 (2.7, 2.8, 2.1
fold), cyclin E (1.7, 1.3, 2.2 fold) and cyclin A (1.7, 1.2,
1.2 fold) protein expression (Figure 3F). ATPγS treatment
(30h) induced CDK2 (1.6 fold) and CDK4 (1.4 fold)
protein expression. Additionally, ATP treatment alone
was sufficient to induce cyclin D3 protein expression in
three of the four HCC cell lines tested; Huh7 (3.2 fold),
SNU-387 (1.6 fold) and PLC/PRF/5 (1.4 fold)) (Suppl.
Figure 5). ATPγS treatment (24h) of human hepatocytes
induced cyclin D3 (2.0 fold) and cyclin E (2.0 fold)
protein expression (Figure 3G). These data suggest that
nucleotide treatment alone was sufficient to promote cell
cycle progression and proliferation in human hepatocytes
as well as liver cancer cells.
To confirm that nucleotide effects on dysregulation
of cyclin expression is mediated via the activation of
P2 purinergic receptors, cells were treated with a broad
spectrum P2 purinergic receptor antagonist - suramin,
prior to nucleotide treatment. Suramin pre-treatment
resulted in a dose dependent attenuation of cyclin
D3 mRNA induction (Figure 3H). Suramin treatment
alone reduced baseline cyclin D3 expression (Figure
3H), suggesting a role for endogenous ATP release and
extracellular nucleotide signaling in basal Huh7 cell cycle
progression.

receptor

To determine if dysregulation of P2 purinergic
receptor expression is associated with hepatocyte
transformation to HCC phenotype and to identify a
suitable in vitro model system for mechanistic studies,
we analyzed P2 purinergic receptor mRNA expression
by qRT-PCR in four human hepatocellular carcinoma cell
lines - Huh7, Hep3B, SNU-387, PLC/PRF/5, and normal
human primary hepatocytes. Suggesting a role for P2
purinergic receptors in hepatocyte transformation, all four
HCC cell lines had upregulation of multiple P2 purinergic
receptor isoforms and lower expression of P2Y13. Huh7,
Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 had lower expression of P2X7 and
upregulation of P2X2 (Figure 2A-2D). Relative mRNA
expression of all 15 purinergic receptor isoforms was
comparable in normal human primary hepatocytes (Figure
2E).

Extracellular nucleotides induce proliferation and
cell-cycle progression in HCC cells
To determine whether P2 purinergic receptor
activation influences HCC cell proliferation, BrdU
incorporation was assessed in HCC cells maintained in
SFM for 24h and treated with ATP for 24h. ATP treatment
alone was sufficient to induce proliferation in each of these
cell lines (Huh7, 34%; Hep3B, 46%; SNU-387, 47% and
PLC/PRF/5, 24%), identifying nucleotides as liver cancer
cell mitogens (Figure 3A). Extracellular ATP can be
hydrolyzed to ADP and adenosine by ectonucleotidases
at the plasma membrane. Therefore, we tested the
effects of ATPγS (non-hydrolyzable analog of ATP) or
ADP (break down product of ATP) (100 µM) on Huh7
cell proliferation. ATPγS treatment alone was sufficient
to induce BrdU incorporation as early as 12h (42%);
maintained at 18h (30%) and 24h (29%) in Huh7 cells
(Suppl. Figure 4). ADP was also able to independently
increase the number of BrdU positive nuclei (12h, 30%;
18h, 35%; 24h, 37%) (Suppl. Figure 4). Furthermore, ATP
treatment (18 h) increased cell proliferation and viability
in all four cell lines as determined by MTT assay (Huh7,

We have previously shown that extracellular

rat primary hepatocytes in vitro [11]. To determine
whether extracellular nucleotides induce JNK signaling
in transformed hepatocytes, Huh7 cells were treated
with nucleotides for 5, 15 and 30 min and total protein
extracts were analyzed by Western blotting for JNK
phosphorylation (Ser Thr/Tyr). ATPγS treatment alone was

P2X3 overexpression increases basal and ATP
mediated cell proliferation

sufficient to induce JNK phosphorylation as early as 15
min (1.7 fold) (Figure 4A). ADP treatment resulted in
similar induction (15 min - 2 fold).
To determine if extracellular nucleotide-mediated
activation of JNK signaling influences cell-cycle
progression in transformed hepatocytes, Huh7 cells were
treated with SP600125 (JNK inhibitor) prior to ATPγS
treatment. Efficiency of JNK inhibition in Huh7 cells was
confirmed by Western blotting for p-c-Jun. JNK inhibition
completely attenuated ATPγS-mediated induction of cyclin
D3, E and A proteins (Figure 4B) identifying a role for
the activation of JNK signaling pathway in P2 purinergic
receptor-mediated induced cell-cycle progression in Huh7
cells.

To confirm P2X3 receptor involvement in HCC cell
proliferation, P2X3 was overexpressed in Huh7 cells then
these cells were treated with ATP +/- P2X3 antagonist,
AF-353. BrdU analysis revealed that P2X3 overexpression
(72h post-transfection) alone was sufficient to significantly
increase proliferation (51%) compared the vector control
pCMV6 (38%). AF-353 treatment (24h) completely
attenuated the P2X3 mediated increase in proliferation
(Figure 6A). ATP Treatment (24h) further increased BrdU
incorporation when compared to the pCMV6 control. ATP
mediated proliferation was significantly higher in cells
overexpressed with P2X3 compared to those transfected
with only pCMV6. Again, pre-treatment with AF-353
significantly attenuated the ATP mediated increase in BrdU
incorporation. Furthermore, P2X3 overexpression alone
was sufficient to improve cell proliferation and viability of
Huh7, Hep3B and PLC/PRF/5 cells as assessed by MTT
assay (Figure 6B)
Collectively, these findings suggest that P2X3
purinergic receptor expression and function is critical
for HCC cell survival and basal proliferation as well
as proliferation in response to changes in nucleotide
concentrations in the extracellular milieu.

P2X3 antagonism attenuates nucleotide-induced
proliferation and cell cycle progression
Prompted by our identification of P2X3 as the most
frequently overexpressed purinergic receptor isoform in
human HCC tumors in our TMC cohort and that P2X3
overexpression is associated with poor recurrencefree survival in our Korean cohort, we performed a
series of mechanistic studies in Huh7 cells in vitro, to
determine the functional significance of P2X3 and its
role in nucleotide-induced proliferation. Huh7 cells were
treated with a highly selective P2X3 antagonist AF-353
prior to ATP treatment. Implicating P2X3 receptors in
nucleotide-mediated proliferation, AF-353 pre-treatment
completely abolished ATP-mediated increase in BrdU
incorporation in Huh7 cells (Figure 5A). Similarly, ATPmediated induction of BrdU incorporation in Hep3B cells
was completely attenuated by pre-treatment with P2X3
antagonist (Suppl. Figure 6). ATP-mediated induction
of cyclin D3 and cyclin E expression were completely
attenuated in Huh7 cells and human hepatocytes pretreated with AF-353 (Figure 5B). Our observations that
P2X3 agonist 2-MeSATP treatment alone was sufficient to
induce cyclin D3 expression (1.9 fold) and pre-treatment
with an alternative P2X3 antagonist, A317491 attenuated
ATP induced cyclin D3 expression in Huh7 cells further
validates the role of P2X3 purinergic receptor activation
in the induction of cell-cycle progression in HCC cells
(Figure 5C & 5D) [32-34].
Interestingly, P2X3 antagonist treatment alone
was sufficient to reduce the baseline BrdU-positive cells
and cyclin protein expression in serum-free conditions,
implicating P2X3 activation as a necessary facilitator of
Huh7 cell cycle progression (Figure 5A-5B). Additionally,
P2X3 antagonist treatment alone resulted in increased
cleaved PARP protein expression, an established marker
of cells undergoing apoptosis (Figure 5E).

Discussion
In this study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis
of all 15 P2 purinergic receptor isoforms in HCC tumors,
as compared to the adjacent uninvolved areas of HCC
livers as well as normal livers. Our studies have identified a
distinct dysregulation of P2 purinergic receptor expression
in HCC livers. The upregulation of P2 purinergic receptor
expression observed among the tumor samples when
compared to their adjacent uninvolved areas highlights
its significance in the pathogenesis of HCC. Altered P2
purinergic receptor expression in the uninvolved areas
of HCC livers (as compared to normal healthy livers)
suggests that purinergic signaling may be dysregulated
prior to HCC development. Therefore, as potential
biomarkers, P2 purinergic receptor upregulation has the
advantage of being detected prior to tumor development
when effective interventions may be undertaken. Another
significant finding of this study is that there is a higher
frequency of P2 purinergic receptor upregulation in HCC
tumors of HCV patients, as compared to those tumors
with non-viral etiologies, identifying a specific subgroup
of HCC with higher prevalence of P2 purinergic receptor
overexpression. However, immunohistochemical analysis
suggests that P2X3 overexpression is evident in HCC
tumors, irrespective of viral status. Further studies in
larger patient cohorts are required to determine the impact
of viral infection on the dysregulation of P2 purinergic

receptor expression and its role in HCC pathogenesis.
Dysregulation of purinergic receptor expression
may influence initiation and temporal progression of
HCC via its influence on dysregulation of cell-cycle
control, a hallmark of HCC cells. In this study, we have
identified that P2X3 purinergic receptor expression and
function is critical for HCC cell survival and proliferation.
Interestingly, P2X3 was the most frequently upregulated
purinergic receptor isoform in our local TMC patient
cohort. It was ranked in the top 7% of overexpressed
genes in the Mas_Liver dataset (Oncomine) and its ‘high’
expression had the strongest correlation with decreased
recurrence free survival in our Korean patient cohort

[26, 30]. Therefore, P2 purinergic receptors can serve
as potential new targets for the development of HCC
therapeutics.
While purinergic signaling has been implicated
in cancer, its influence on proliferation varies by cancer
cell type and cell-type specific P2 purinergic receptor
expression profile [10, 13, 14, 17-22]. We observed
differential P2 purinergic receptor expression profiles
among the four HCC cell lines tested (Figure 2). This

responses, such that a cancer cell may benefit from
increased expression of some isoforms and decreased
expression of others. Confirming previous findings, P2X7,
and P2Y13 expression were reduced, as compared to the
other receptor isoforms, in three of the four HCC cell
lines tested [35, 36]. P2X7 purinergic receptor activation
induces apoptosis by increasing intracellular levels of
Ca2+ in multiple cell types [10]. It is no surprise then
that this receptor is down regulated in cancer cells as a
means of avoiding cell death. In our TMC patient cohort,
P2X7 had a lower frequency of upregulation (33%),
as did P2Y13 (31%), as compared to other receptors
such as P2X3 (60%) (Table 1). Our data show a strong
positive correlation between ‘low’ P2Y13 expression and
increased recurrence free survival in our Korean cohort
(Figure 1D). P2Y13 purinergic receptor, preferentially
activated by ADP, has been shown to play a role in the
activation of anti-oxidant Nrf2/HO-1 axis to protect
against oxidative stress-induced neuronal death [37].
It is well established that oxidative stress contributes to
the development of HCC and it is reported that patients
with HCC that exhibit increased oxidative stress levels
are prone to recurrence after ‘curative’ treatment [38,
39]. P2X2 expression was elevated in three HCC cell
lines tested. Compared to the normal livers, P2X2 had the
highest frequency of upregulation in HCC tumor tissues
(83%) (Table1). It is noteworthy that P2X2 often forms
heteromultimeric complexes with P2X3, the other highly
overexpressed receptor in our TMC patient cohort [40].
Overall, P2 purinergic receptor expression is dysregulated
in HCC cells commensurate with its hyper-proliferative
transformed phenotype, as compared to quiescent
hepatocytes isolated from normal healthy adult livers.
Our finding that extracellular nucleotides induce
cyclin D3, cyclin E and cyclin A protein expression via
activation of JNK signaling is of significant interest to
our understanding of pathogenesis of HCC, as it has been
previously reported that JNK1 expression is increased
in primary hepatocellular carcinomas [41, 42]. Cyclin
D3 was reported to be upregulated in 51-72% of HCC
tissues and was overexpressed in the Mas_liver dataset
(Supp. Figure 7) [26, 43, 44]. Our in vitro studies suggest
nucleotide induced cyclin D3 expression is mediated via
activation of P2X3 purinergic receptors in Huh7 cells.
We show that nucleotide treatment induces CDK4 protein
expression. Studies suggest that the function of CDK4 is
most critical for G1/S HCC cell cycle progression and that
CDK4 is activated by cyclins D and E [45, 46].
P2X3 overexpression increases cell proliferation
and viability, indicating for the first time the critical role
of P2X3 receptors in HCC cell growth. These findings
highlight the functional significance of increased P2X3
receptor expression in the tumors. Furthermore, the
attenuation of P2X3 mediated proliferation by P2X3
antagonist, AF-353, clearly highlights the potential
therapeutic application by pharmaceutical control of P2X3

receptor activation against HCC propagation.
P2X3 receptor expression in afferent neurons and its
role in pain sensation is well characterized [33]. Although
P2X3 expression has been reported in hepatocytes,
cholangiocytes, and portal vein myocyctes in the liver and
liver derived cell lines, P2X3 receptor function in hepatic
cells has not been well characterized [36, 47-49]. Recently,
P2X3 has been reported to be involved in the complex
regulation of liver regeneration through its expression
on Natural Killer (NK) cells [50, 51]. It is reported that
NK cells are reduced in the intratumoral tissue of HCC
patients, particularly those with advanced stage HCC
[52, 53]. In the present study, we provide evidence for
P2X3 overexpression in hepatocytes, as assessed by
immunohistochemical analysis of HCC patient livers
and its role in hepatocyte proliferation, as assessed by
in vitro studies in human primary hepatocytes and four
independent HCC-derived cell lines. Further studies
are required to determine if P2X3 purinergic receptor
expression in immune cells infiltrating HCC tumors plays
a role in HCC pathogenesis.
Considering previous findings of increased ATP
concentrations in the extracellular milieu in injured and
inflamed livers [8] and in the tumor interstitium [18], as
well as our findings of increased P2 purinergic receptor
expression in HCC liver tumors, our observations of
nucleotide-mediated increased proliferation in HCC cells
is particularly meaningful.
In conclusion, extracellular nucleotides via the
activation of P2 purinergic receptors induce proliferation
and cell cycle progression in HCC cells. P2 purinergic
receptor expression is significantly dysregulated in
HCC tumor tissues and exhibits strong correlation with
recurrence-free survival in HCC patients. These studies
underscore the potential role of purinergic signaling in
the pathogenesis of HCC, and highlight the utility of P2
purinergic receptors as a potential new class of biomarkers
and therapeutic targets.

Materials and Methods
HCC patients
Liver tumors and adjacent, uninvolved areas (42
pairs) were obtained from HCC patients undergoing
resection or liver transplantation at St. Luke’s Episcopal
Hospital and Ben Taub Hospital in the Texas Medical
Center, Houston TX (TMC cohort). Normal livers
(6 samples) were obtained from donor livers prior to
transplantation at the St. Luke’s Episcopal Hospital.
Tumor specimens were obtained from an additional
188 HCC patients undergoing hepatectomy at Seoul
National University, Guro Hospital of Korea University,
Seoul, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, and Dong41175

Real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase
polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)

San Medical Center of Keimyung University, Daegu,
Korea (Korean cohort). Gene expression data from
the Korean cohort were generated using the Illumina
microarray platform human-6 versions 2 and 4 (Illumina,
San Diego, CA). These patients were followed up
prospectively at least once every 3 months after surgery.
Primary microarray data from the Korean cohort are
available in NCBI’s GEO public database (accession
numbers GSE16757 and GSE43619). The study protocols
were approved by the Institutional Review Boards of
institutions, and all participants had provided written,
informed consent.

Total RNA was isolated from human livers or
cells using Trizol Reagent according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Invitrogen, NY). Complementary DNA
(cDNA) synthesis and qRT-PCR were performed, as
described in Supplementary Methods.

Statistical analysis
Data was analyzed by one way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) or unpaired Student’s t test. Values
of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
TMC cohort patients were stratified by P2 purinergic
receptor expression (‘high’ - ≥ 2-fold vs ‘low’ - ≤ 0. 5
fold as compared to uninvolved areas). Korean cohort
patients were stratified according to ‘high’ (above
median) and ‘low’ (below median) expression for P2
Receptor gene expression and prognostic difference was
assessed by Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test [31].
Cox proportional hazard model analysis was done on the
Korean patient cohort to test the interaction between HBV
status and P2 purinergic receptor expression on the risk of
recurrence.

Oncomine database
The Oncomine 4.5 (www.oncomine.org), a publicly
available database of published cancer gene expression
profiles, was queried for alterations in P2 purinergic
receptor (P2X3, P2Y13) and cyclin D3 genes with
additional filters defined for the analysis type (cancer
vs normal) and cancer type: liver cancer. Five gene
expression and three DNA copy number datasets were
retrieved for further analysis, comparing HCC vs normal
[24-29]. All gene expression data were log-transformed
and median-centered and all statistical analyses were
performed using functions implemented in Oncomine. P
value of less than 0.05 (p < 0.05) is considered significant
[30].

Financial support
This study was supported by NIH RO1 DK069558
(ST), CPRIT Pre-Doctoral Training Grant RP101499 (JM),
and DK56338, which funds the Texas Medical Center
