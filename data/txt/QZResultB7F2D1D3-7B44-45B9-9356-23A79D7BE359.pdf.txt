Abstract
CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), initially linked with
leukocyte trafficking, is now known to be expressed in
various tumors including breast, ovary, prostate, gastrointestinal, head and neck, bladder, brain, and melanoma. This
receptor mediates homing of tumor cells to specific organs
that express the ligand CXCL12 for this receptor. Thus,
agents that can down-regulate CXCR4 expression have
potential against cancer metastasis. In this study, we report
the identification of zerumbone, a component of subtropical
ginger (Zingiber zerumbet), as a regulator of CXCR4
expression. This sesquiterpene down-regulated the expression of CXCR4 on HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The decrease in
CXCR4 by zerumbone was found to be not cell type specific
as its expression was abrogated in leukemic, skin, kidney,
lung, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The down-regulation
of CXCR4 was not due to proteolytic degradation but rather
to transcriptional regulation, as indicated by down-regulation of mRNA expression, inhibition of nuclear factor-KB
activity, and suppression of chromatin immunoprecipitation
activity. Suppression of CXCR4 expression by zerumbone
correlated with the inhibition of CXCL12-induced invasion
of both breast and pancreatic cancer cells. An analogue of
zerumbone, A-humulene, which lacks the carbonyl group,
was found to be inactive in inducing CXCR4 downregulation. Overall, our results show that zerumbone is a
novel inhibitor of CXCR4 expression and thus has a
potential in the suppression of cancer metastasis. [Cancer

Introduction
Metastasis, which occurs in as many as 90% of cancer-associated
deaths, is a highly complex process that is organ selective and
involves interactions between the cancer cells and the host (1).
Numerous molecules have been linked with cancer metastasis
including matrix metalloproteases, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), platelet-derived
growth factor, transforming growth factor h, and TWIST (2–6).
The mechanism of organ-specific tumor metastasis, however, is still

not completely understood. Evidence that chemokines can mediate
tumor metastasis, first identified in breast cancer (7), is becoming
increasingly evident for other cancers as well (8, 9). Chemokines
constitute a superfamily of cytokine-like small chemoattractant
proteins that orchestrate immunologic and inflammatory processes such as leukocyte trafficking, adhesion, hematopoiesis, and
angiogenesis.
One of the most extensively studied chemokines in tumor cell
migration and metastasis is stromal cell–derived factor 1a [SDF1a; also known as CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)] and its
receptor, CXCR4 (10). CXCR4 is expressed on a diverse array of
cancer cell types, including those of lung, prostate, breast, kidney,
and ovary (7, 11). The ligand of CXCR4, CXCL12 (SDF-1), is
expressed at the site of tumor metastasis involved in homing of the
tumors to different organs (12).
CXCR4 has been linked with leukocyte trafficking (13), B-cell
lymphopoiesis and myelopoiesis (14), neuronal cell migration (15),
and HIV invasion of host cells (16). In addition, CXCR4/SDF-1 plays
an important role in the targeted metastasis of breast cancer (7).
The SDF-1/CXCR4 attraction leads breast cancer cells to leave the
circulation and migrate into organs that express large amounts of
chemokines, where the cancer cells proliferate, induce angiogenesis, and form metastatic tumors.
The HER2 receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to induce the
up-regulation of CXCR4 that leads to breast cancer invasion (17).
CXCR4 is also involved in the metastasis of prostate cancer to the
bone marrow (18) and of colon cancer to the liver (19). CXCR4
expression has been correlated with poor overall survival rate in
patients with breast cancer (20) and colon cancer (21). Thus,
CXCR4 is viewed as a probable therapeutic target for preventing
cancer metastasis.
Natural products, generally regarded as safe, have been shown to
mediate anticancer activities against variety of cell types. In most
cases, however, neither their active component nor their mechanism of action is well understood. Zerumbone, a sesquiterpene
derived from the rhizome of Zingiber zerumbet (also called
shampoo ginger or Narkachur), has been shown to exhibit
antitumor activities as indicated by inhibition of skin tumor
initiation and promotion in ICR mice (22), suppression of
azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt formation in rat (23),
inhibition of dextran sodium sulfate–induced colitis (24), suppression of cholecystokinin octapeptide–induced acute pancreatitis in
rats (25), and increase in survival of p388-bearing CDF-1 mice (26).
Because CXCR4 is known to mediate growth and metastasis of
tumor, we hypothesized that zerumbone may modulate the
expression of CXCR4 and inhibit tumor cell invasion. Our results
show that this sesquiterpene can down-regulate both the

atmosphere of 5% CO2-95% air.
Western blotting. For detection of CXCR4, zerumbone-treated wholecell extracts were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mmol/L
NaCl, 2 mmol/L EDTA (pH 8.0), 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.01 mg/mL aprotinin,
0.005 mg/mL leupeptin, 0.4 mmol/L phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and
4 mmol/L NaVO4). Lysates were then spun at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to
remove insoluble material and resolved on a 10% SDS gel. After
electrophoresis, the proteins were electrotransferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane, blocked with 5% nonfat milk, and probed with anti-CXCR4
antibodies (1:3,000) overnight at 4jC. The blot was washed, exposed to
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h, and finally
examined by chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).
Electrophoretic mobility shift assay. To evaluate the activation of
nuclear factor nB (NF-nB) following radiation therapy, electrophoretic
mobility shift assay was done as described previously (28).

the proteins were cross-linked with DNA with
formaldehyde and then subjected to chromatin
immunoprecipitation assay with an anti-p65
antibody with the CXCR4 primer. Reaction
products were resolved by electrophoresis.

RNA analysis and reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNA was extracted
using Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen,
Life Technologies). One microgram of total RNA was converted to cDNA by
Superscript reverse transcriptase and then amplified by Platinum Taq
polymerase using Superscript One-Step reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)
kit (Invitrogen). The relative expression of CXCR4 and CXCR7 was analyzed
by quantitative RT-PCR with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GAPDH) as an internal control. The following pairs of forward and reverse
primer sets were used: CXCR4, 5¶-GAAGCTGTTGGCTGAAAAGG-3¶ and 5¶GAGTCGATGCTGATCCCAAT-3¶ (PCR product size, 345 bp; GenBank
accession no. NM_003467); and CXCR7, 5¶-CTCACGTGCAAAGTCACACA-3¶
and 5¶-CGATAATGGAGAAGGGAACG-3¶ (PCR product size, 343 bp; GenBank
accession no. NM_001047841). The RT-PCR reaction mixture contained
12.5 AL of 2 reaction buffer, 10 AL each of cDNA, 0.5 AL each of forward and
reverse primers, and 1 AL of RT-Platinum Taq in a final volume of 50 AL. The
reaction was done at 50jC for 30 min, 94jC for 2 min, 94jC for 30 cycles of
15 s each, 54jC for 30 s, and 72jC for 1 min with extension at 72jC for 10 min.
PCR products were run on 2% agarose gel and then stained with ethidium
bromide. Stained bands were visualized under UV light and photographed.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was done as previously described with some modifications (29).
MCF7/HER2 cells (2  107) were incubated with or without 25 Amol//L
zerumbone for the indicated times. PCR analyses were carried out for 39
cycles with primers 5¶-CTTAGGAAATGCCTCTGGGAGGTCC-3¶ ( forward)

DNA fragment ( 187 to 50) contains the NF-nB binding site of
109GGGCTCCC 101; ref. 30].
Invasion assay. In vitro invasion assay was done using BD Bio-Coat
Matrigel invasion assay system (BD Biosciences) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cancer cells (2  105) were suspended in

medium (2% FBS-RPMI 1640 for AsPC-1 and 10% FBS-DMEM/F12 for
MCF7/HER2) and seeded into the Matrigel-precoated transwell chambers
with polycarbonate membranes of 8-Am pore size. After preincubation with
or without zerumbone (25 Amol/L) for 6 h, transwell chambers were then
placed into 24-well plates, in which was added the basal medium only or
basal medium containing 100 ng/mL CXCL12. After incubation (24 h for
AsPC-1 and 60 h for MCF7/HER2), the upper surface of transwell chambers
was wiped off with a cotton swab and invading cells were fixed and stained
with a Diff-Quick stain. The invading cell numbers were counted in five
randomly selected microscope fields (200).
Statistical analysis. The experiments have been done in triplicate and
repeated twice. The P value was obtained after ANOVA and StudentNewman-Keul tests.

Results
The present study was designed to investigate the effect in tumor
cells of zerumbone on both the constitutive and inducible
expression CXCR4, the chemokine receptor that plays a critical
role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. We also investigated the
effect of zerumbone on CXCR4 in various tumor cell types and
invasive activity.
Zerumbone suppresses the expression of CXCR4 protein in
HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. HER2 overexpression
has been linked with metastasis of breast cancer. Furthermore,
HER2 has been shown to induce the expression of CXCR4 on breast
cancer cells (17). As shown in Fig. 1A, expression of HER2 in MCF7
cells indeed induced the expression of CXCR4. Whether zerumbone
can modulate the expression of CXCR4 in MCF7/HER2 cells was

investigated. When MCF7/HER2 cells were incubated either with
different concentrations of zerumbone for 24 hours or with
25 Amol/L zerumbone for different times, zerumbone suppressed
the expression of CXCR4 in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Fig. 1B and C). Zerumbone-induced suppression could be
observed as early as 3 hours and with a concentration as low as
20 Amol/L. The exposure of cells to 25 Amol/L zerumbone for
24 hours significantly inhibited CXCR4 expression. This downregulation was not due to decrease in cell viability because >90%
cells were viable under these conditions (data not shown).
Down-regulation of CXCR4 by zerumbone accompanies
down-regulation of HER2 in breast cancer cells. Because HER2
enhances the expression of CXCR4 by stimulating CXCR4 translation and attenuating CXCR4 degradation (31), whether zerumbone
down-regulates CXCR4 expression through regulation of HER2
expression was examined. For this, HER2-overexpressing MCF7 cells
were incubated with 10 and 25 Amol/L zerumbone for 24 hours and
then examined for both CXCR4 and HER2 expression by Western
blot analysis with specific antibodies. We found that zerumbone
completely suppressed CXCR4 expression at 25 Amol/L, but HER2
expression was only partially affected (Fig. 2A), thus suggesting that

down-regulation of CXCR4 expression by zerumbone is not entirely
due to modulation of HER2 expression.
Zerumbone down-modulates CXCR4 in different cell types.
Up to this point, our all studies were carried out with HER2overexpressing breast cancer cells. CXCR4, however, is overexpressed on wide variety of tumor cells. Thus, we investigated
whether zerumbone down-regulates expression of CXCR4 in
leukemia (KBM-5), myeloma (U266), head and neck squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC4), kidney (A293), lung adenocarcinoma (H1299),
and pancreatic (PANC-1, PANC-28, and MIA PaCa-2) cancer cell
lines. Cells were treated with 25 Amol/L zerumbone for 24 hours
and then examined CXCR4 expression. Figure 2B shows that
zerumbone down-regulated CXCR4 on all these cell lines but most
dramatically in head and neck (SCC4) and pancreatic cancer cells
(MIA PaCa-2; Fig. 2B, bottom). Thus, CXCR4 down-regulation by
zerumbone is not cell type specific.
Down-regulation of CXCR4 by zerumbone is not mediated
through its degradation. Because zerumbone could downregulate CXCR4 expression by enhancing its degradation, and
CXCR4 has been shown to undergo ubiquitination at its lysine
residue followed by degradation (32, 33), we first explored the
possibility that zerumbone enhances the rate of degradation
through the activation of proteasomes. To determine this, we
examined the ability of lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, to block
zerumbone-induced degradation of CXCR4 in MCF7/HER2 cells.
Cells were pretreated with lactacystin for 1 hour before being
exposed to zerumbone. As shown in Fig. 3A, lactacystin had no
effect on zerumbone-induced degradation of CXCR4, suggesting
that this is an unlikely mechanism for zerumbone effects on CXCR4
regulation.
Because CXCR4 can undergo ligand-dependent lysosomal
degradation (33), we examined the ability of chloroquine, a
lysosomal inhibitor, to block zerumbone-induced degradation of
CXCR4. To examine this, cells were pretreated with chloroquine for
1 hour before exposure to zerumbone. Chloroquine at 200 Amol/L
only slightly prevented the degradation of CXCR4 (Fig. 3A, bottom),
indicating that this was not the primary pathway for suppression of
expression of CXCR4.
Down-regulation of CXCR4 by zerumbone occurs at the
transcriptional level. Because zerumbone did not down-regulate
CXCR4 expression by enhancing its degradation, we investigated
whether suppression occurs at the transcriptional level using
RT-PCR. Cells were treated with zerumbone for different times
and then examined for mRNA. As shown in Fig. 3B, zerumbone
induced the down-regulation of CXCR4 mRNA. Interestingly,
zerumbone had no effect on the mRNA of another chemokine
receptor, CXCR7, thus indicating that the effects are specific for
CXCR4.
Zerumbone suppresses constitutive activation of NF-KB in
MCF7/HER2 cells. Previously, Biswas and Iglehart (34) reported
that HER2 expression and NF-nB activation were related in breast
cancer. We used a DNA-binding assay to explore whether
overexpression of HER2 affects NF-nB activation in MCF7 breast
cancer cells. HER2-overexpressing MCF7 cells showed constitutive
NF-nB activation, although nontransfected and vector-transfected
(neo) cells did not show any NF-nB activation (Fig. 3C, left).
Treatment of HER2-overexpressing cells with zerumbone downregulated NF-nB activation in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 3C,
right). Thus, these results suggest that zerumbone may downregulate CXCR4 expression through down-regulation of NF-nB
activation.

Zerumbone inhibits binding of NF-KB to the CXCR4
promoter. Whether the down-regulation of CXCR4 by zerumbone
in MCF7/HER2 cells was due to suppression of NF-nB activation
in vivo was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay
targeting NF-nB binding in the CXCR4 promoter. We found that
zerumbone suppressed the NF-nB binding to CXCR4 promoter
(Fig. 3D). Overall, these results suggest that zerumbone inhibits
CXCR4 expression by suppressing NF-nB binding to the CXCR4
promoter.
Zerumbone suppresses CXCL12-induced breast cancer cell
invasion. Several lines of evidence implicate the role of CXCR4 in
breast cancer metastasis (7, 35). Müller and colleagues (7) found
that the motility and migration of breast cancer cells can be
induced when they are exposed to their ligand, CXCL12. In
addition, breast cancer metastasis can be inhibited by silencing
CXCR4 (35). Whether down-regulation of CXCR4 by zerumbone
correlates with breast cancer cell migration was examined using an
in vitro invasion assay. We found that CXCL12 induced the invasion
of breast cancer cells and that zerumbone effectively abrogated the
invasion (Fig. 4A and B). Because MCF7 cells are not as invasive as
AsPC-1, only a small number of MCF7 cells invade through the
Matrigel. This may explain why the SE is high for MCF7 cells.
Zerumbone inhibits CXCL12-induced pancreatic cancer cell
invasion. Whether suppression of invasion by zerumbone is tumor
cell specific was also investigated. CXCL12/CXCR4 signaling has
been shown to play a critical role in pancreatic cancer metastasis
(36). To elucidate whether zerumbone had an effect on pancreatic
cancer cell metastasis, we examined the effect of zerumbone on
CXCL12-induced cell invasion. As shown in Fig. 5A and B,
treatment of zerumbone suppressed CXCL12-induced invasion of
pancreatic cancer AsPC-1 cells.

Whether zerumbone suppressed invasion through the downregulation of CXCR4 in AsPC-1 cells was also examined. We found
that zerumbone down-regulated the expression of both mRNA
(Fig. 5C) and protein (Fig. 5D) for CXCR4.
A-Humulene, a zerumbone analogue, does not suppress
CXCR4. Furthermore, the zerumbone analogue, a-humulene, which
lacks a carbonyl group at the 8-position in zerumbone (Fig. 6A), has
been shown to be inactive in suppressing free radical generation, cell
proliferation, and apoptosis induction (37). Whether a-humulene
affects CXCR4 expression was examined. As shown in Fig. 6B,
a-humulene had no effect on CXCR4 expression, whereas zerumbone
down-modulated CXCR4 expression at the same concentration.

Discussion
The goal of the present study was to determine whether
zerumbone, a component of shampoo ginger that has been linked
with anticancer activities, can suppress the expression of CXCR4, a
chemokine receptor that has been closely linked with cancer cell
growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Our results showed
for the first time that zerumbone abolished the expression of
CXCR4. A wide variety of tumor cells expressed CXCR4, and
zerumbone down-regulated expression irrespective of the cell type.
Besides constitutive CXCR4 expression, zerumbone also suppressed
HER2-induced CXCR4 expression in breast cancer cells. Our results
showed that down-regulation of CXCR4 did not occur through
proteolytic degradation of the receptor but rather through downregulation of the transcript. Furthermore, suppression of receptor
expression led to down-regulation of invasion whether induced by
tumor cells or the ligand CXCL12.
The CXCR4 chemokine receptor till now has been reported to be
overexpressed in more than 20 different tumors, including breast

melanoma, cervical cancer, colon carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma,
astrocytoma, small-cell lung carcinoma, chronic lymphocytic
leukemia, renal cancer, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (31, 38–40).
What leads to overexpression of this receptor in tumor cells is not
fully understood, but the role of genetic alterations in protein
degradation pathways (32, 33) and of tumor hypoxia (41) has been
reported. Inflammatory cytokines such as TNF (42) and VEGF (43)
can induce the expression of CXCR4. More recently, the growth
factor receptor HER2 has also been linked with overexpression of
the chemokine receptor (44).
The ligand-dependent down-regulation of the CXCR4 receptor
by lysosomal degradation is well documented (32). Recent evidence
suggests that degradation involves atrophin-interacting protein-4–
mediated ubiquitination and degradation (33). Our results,
however, suggest that zerumbone does not down-regulate CXCR4
through this mechanism. We found that down-regulation occurs at
the transcription level. The transcription factors HIF-1a (41, 45),
PPARg (46), and NF-nB (47) have been implicated in the regulation
of CXCR4. von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor pVHL was found to
down-regulate CXCR4 expression under hypoxic conditions (45).
Zerumbone has been shown to down-regulate NF-nB activation.
Therefore, it is possible that down-regulation of CXCR4 occurs
through down-regulation of NF-nB activation. We found that,
indeed, down-regulation of NF-nB by zerumbone mediates downregulation of CXCR4. Our results are in agreement with those of Li

and colleagues (17) who showed that HER2-induced CXCR4
expression requires NF-nB activation. Other mechanisms than
suppression of NF-nB activation that are involved in downregulation of CXCR4 by zerumbone cannot be ruled out.
Besides CXCR4, the activation of NF-nB induces expression of
various adhesion molecules including intracellular adhesion
molecule 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and endothelialleukocyte adhesion molecule 1, which are also linked with cancer
cell metastasis to other organs. Because zerumbone can inhibit
both inducible and constitutively activated NF-nB activation (28), it
is possible that zerumbone can suppress the expression of these
adhesion molecules as well. Our data showed that zerumbone
suppressed both constitutive and inducible CXCR4 expression on
various types of cancer cells. Thus, the effect of zerumbone on
CXCR4 is not limited to a single cell type.
We also found that zerumbone suppressed the ligand-induced
invasion of both breast and pancreatic cancers. This shows
the critical role of the CXCR4 receptor in invasion of the tumor
and the potential of zerumbone to down-regulate the expression or
the activity of CXCR4. Elevated levels of CXCR4 have been reported
with nodal metastasis of human breast cancer (48).
We found that the carbonyl group of zerumbone is critical for its
activity, whereas a-humulene, which lacks this group, had no
activity. How the a-carbonyl of zerumbone mediates this role is
unclear. It is possible that Michael acceptor in zerumbone is
needed for its activity. This is in agreement with 15-deoxy-D12,14prostaglandin J2, which has a Michael acceptor and down-regulates
CXCR4 through down-regulation of NF-nB (49). Rationally designed
CXCR4 antagonists such as AMD3100 and AMD3465 have Michael
acceptor in their structures (50).
Zerumbone has been shown to inhibit tumor initiation and
promotion (22), azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt formation
(23), dextran sodium sulfate–induced colitis (24), cholecystokinin
octapeptide–induced pancreatitis (25), and antitumor effects
against p388 (26). It is possible that some of these antitumor effects
of zerumbone are also mediated through CXCR4 regulation. Taken
together, our data suggest that zerumbone can down-regulate the
expression of CXCR4, a key receptor involved in the cross talk
between tumor cells and its microenvironment, which contributes to
its anti-invasive activity. Further in vivo studies are needed to show
the relevance of these observations to cancer treatment.
