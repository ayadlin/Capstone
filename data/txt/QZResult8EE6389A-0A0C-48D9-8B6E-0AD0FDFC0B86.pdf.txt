regulating a variety of cellular processes, including adhesion,
migration, proliferation, differentiation, and death (3–5). The
expression of avh6 is restricted primarily to epithelial cells where
it is expressed at relatively low levels in healthy tissue and
significantly up-regulated during development, injury, wound
healing, and in epithelial tumors (6–11). The avh6 integrin may
have multiple regulatory functions in tumor cell biology. The
extracellular and transmembrane domains have been shown to
mediate transforming growth factor-h (TGF-h) activation and
adhesion (12, 13). The cytoplasmic domain of the h6 subunit
contains a unique 11-amino-acid sequence that has been implicated
in mediating cell proliferation, matrix metalloproteinase production,
invasion, and survival (14–18).
avh6 can bind to several ligands, including fibronectin, tenascin, and the latency-associated peptide-1 and latency-associated
peptide-3 (LAP1 and LAP3), the NH2-terminal region of the latent
precursor form of TGF-h1 and TGF-h3, through a direct interaction with an RGD motif (2, 13, 19). avh6 binding to LAP1 or LAP3
leads to activation of the latent precursor form of TGF-h1 and
TGF-h3 (13). Thus, up-regulated expression of avh6 can lead to
local activation of TGF-h, which then has the potential to affect
neighboring cells in a paracrine fashion. Up-regulated avh6 expression has been shown to be associated with increased epithelial
to mesenchymal transition, increased tumor cell invasion, and
increased metastatic potential in vivo (9, 16, 20, 21). The overexpression of avh6 on tumors, particularly at the tumor-stromal
interface, may reflect a unique mechanism for local activation of
TGF-h1 and the ability to promote tumor progression, invasion, and
metastasis.
The TGF-h1 cytokine is a pleiotropic growth factor that can
regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, and immune responses
(22, 23). Although TGF-h is recognized as an inhibitor of normal
epithelial cell proliferation and an early-stage tumor suppressor,
tumor cells often acquire a resistance to the growth-suppressive
activities of TGF-h1 during tumor progression (24–26). In some
tumors, TGF-h1 expression and activity has been implicated in
promoting survival, progression, and metastases (25, 27, 28). This is
postulated to be mediated by both paracrine effects in the local
tumor-stromal environment, including the effects of TGF-h1 on
immune surveillance, angiogenesis, and increased tumor interstitial pressure, as well as autocrine effects inducing survival signals
directly in tumor cells (29, 30). Several studies have now shown
the antitumor effects of inhibiting the TGF-h1 pathway (24, 27, 28,
31, 32).
We have previously described the generation of potent and selective function blocking avh6 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; ref. 33).

Abstract
The AvB6 integrin is up-regulated on epithelial malignancies
and has been implicated in various aspects of cancer progression. Immunohistochemical analysis of AvB6 expression in
10 human tumor types showed increased expression relative
to normal tissues. Squamous carcinomas of the cervix, skin,
esophagus, and head and neck exhibited the highest frequency
of expression, with positive immunostaining in 92% (n = 46),
84% (n = 49), 68% (n = 56), and 64% (n = 100) of cases,
respectively. We studied the role of AvB6 in Detroit 562 human
pharyngeal carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Prominent
AvB6 expression was detected on tumor xenografts at the
tumor-stroma interface resembling the expression on human
head and neck carcinomas. Nonetheless, coculturing cells
in vitro with matrix proteins did not up-regulate AvB6 expression. Detroit 562 cells showed AvB6-dependent adhesion
and activation of transforming growth factor-B (TGF-B) that
was inhibited >90% with an AvB6 blocking antibody, 6.3G9.
Although both recombinant soluble TGF-B receptor type-II
(rsTGF-BRII-Fc) and 6.3G9 inhibited TGF-B–mediated Smad2/
3 phosphorylation in vitro, there was no effect on proliferation. Conversely, in vivo, 6.3G9 and rsTGF-BRII-Fc inhibited
xenograft tumor growth by 50% (n = 10, P < 0.05) and >90%
(n = 10, P < 0.001), respectively, suggesting a role for the
microenvironment in this response. However, stromal collagen and smooth muscle actin content in xenograft sections
were unchanged with treatments. Although further studies are
required to consolidate in vitro and in vivo results and define
the mechanisms of tumor inhibition by AvB6 antibodies, our
findings support a role for AvB6 in human cancer and underscore the therapeutic potential of function blocking AvB6
antibodies. [Cancer Res 2008;68(2):561–70]

Introduction
The avh6 receptor is one member of the large family of
integrin proteins that are expressed in heterodimeric form on
the surface of essentially all cells (1, 2). Integrins are involved in

POROS R2/H reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) column (Perseptive Biosystems), using a gradient from 35% to
50% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peak fractions containing h6
were pooled, lyophilized, and reconstituted in PBS. Proteins were analyzed
using electrophoresis on a 4% to 20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Invitrogen)
under nonreducing conditions and visualized using Coomassie blue protein
stain.
Generation of human/mouse chimeric, IgG2a, and aglycosylated
IgG2a mAbs. ch6.2A1 cDNA was generated from parent hybridoma RNA
using a First Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham/Pharmacia). Heavy and
light chain variable regions were amplified by PCR using 3¶ primers used for
cDNA synthesis and pools of degenerate primers and Pfu DNA polymerase
(Stratagene). Variable regions were ligated into expression vectors with
human IgG1 constant regions.
To generate the IgG2a and aglycosylated IgG2a forms of 6.3G9, DNA
encoding the signal sequence and variable region of 6.3G9 was amplified by
PCR with oligonucleotide primers containing a 5¶ NotI and 3¶ BstE2 site.
Constant regions of wild-type and N300Q (aglycosylated) variant forms of
murine IgG2a were PCR amplified from murine IgG2a cDNA with primers
containing a 5¶ BstE2 and 3¶ NotI site. Variable and constant regions were
cloned into the NotI site of the pKJS157 plasmid (Invitrogen). Murine n
chain was generated by PCR amplification of 6.3G9 cDNA with primers
containing a 5¶ XbaI and 3¶ HindIII site. The murine n constant region was
PCR amplified from murine n cDNA with primers containing a 5¶ HindIII
and 3¶ XbaI site. Light chain variable and constant regions were cloned into
the XbaI site of the pKJS157 plasmid.
Flow cytometry analysis. Cells were resuspended in fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) buffer (1 PBS, 2% FBS, 0.1% NaN3, 1 mmol/L
CaCl2, and 1 mmol/L MgCl2) containing 6.3G9 or anti–TGF-hRII antibodies,
at 10 Ag/mL. Where indicated, rshuTGF-hRII was added in 10-fold excess of
the TGF-hRII antibody. After incubation for 30 min on ice, cells were
washed and resuspended in FACS buffer containing 5 Ag/mL phycoerythrinconjugated secondary antibodies and incubated on ice for 30 min. After
washing, binding of secondary antibody was monitored by flow cytometry.
Protein binding assays and cell-based adhesion assays. These assays
were carried out as previously described (33).
Proliferation assays. Detroit 562 cells were seeded at 2.5  105 per well
in 96-well plates in culture medium containing 2% charcoal-stripped serum
and allowed to adhere overnight. Active or latent TGF-h1 was added to
quadruplicate wells and cells were incubated at 37jC for 24 h for TGF-h1
titration experiments and for 48 h for blocking studies. Latent TGF-h1 was
added at 10 ng/mL, and 6.3G9 was added at 10 Ag/mL. Methyl[3H]thymidine (1 ACi; Amersham/GE Healthcare Biosciences) was added
per well for the last 4 h of the incubation period. After trypsinization, cells
were harvested using a Brandel MXR96TI Harvester (Brandel) on Wallac
1450 filtermats for subsequent measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation using a Wallac 1450 Microbeta scintillation counter (Wallac/PerkinElmer).
TGF-B1 ELISA. Detroit 562 cells were plated at 5  106 per well in sixwell plates and incubated overnight. Cells were washed with PBS, and
culture medium containing 1% FBS medium was added and incubated at
37jC for 24 h. Culture supernatants were collected and analyzed for both
active and total TGF-h1 levels using a Quantikine human TGF-h1 immunoassay kit following the protocol provided (R&D Systems).
TGF-B1 bioassay (TMLC coculture assay). This assay was carried out
as previously described (33) using Detroit 562 cells and TMLC, mink lung
epithelial cells transfected with a PAI-1-luciferase reporter gene construct.
mAbs and rsTGF-hRII were assayed at a final concentration of 10 Ag/mL.
Immunohistochemistry. Sections were deparaffinized in xylene and
ethanol, rehydrated in water, and immersed in methanol containing 0.45%
H2O. Tissues were then incubated with pepsin (Zymed) and blocked with
avidin and biotin (Vector Laboratories). For immunostaining h6 on tumor
xenograft tissues, sections were incubated with ch6.2A1 and an antihuman
biotinylated secondary antibody. For immunostaining h6 on human tissue,
sections were incubated with 6.2A1 and an antimurine biotinylated secondary antibody. For immunostaining TGF-hRII, sections were incubated with
primary antibody, with or without a 10-fold molar excess of rshuTGF-hRII.

In this article, we further describe the identification of mAbs that
specifically bind to denatured h6, allowing for the analysis of avh6
expression on paraffin-embedded tissues. Previously generated
avh6 antibodies used for immunohistochemistry have not clearly
shown selective binding to the avh6 integrin. A murine mAb described here, 6.2A1, represents the first avh6 antibody to be fully
characterized, and that shows specific binding to both intact and
denatured forms of both human and mouse avh6 integrin. This
is a major advantage in that most human tissues that are available
for immunohistochemical analysis are only accessible as paraffinembedded tissue. The 6.2A1 mAb was used to analyze the expression of avh6 in a variety of human primary and metastatic cancers,
and to compare this expression with that in normal tissue. Further, we generated a human/mouse chimeric version of this mAb
(ch6.2A1) to allow immunohistochemical detection of avh6 on tissue isolated from mouse models. The human/mouse chimeric form
of the mAb contains a human IgG1 Fc region, allowing the use of
an antihuman secondary antibody. In our studies, squamous carcinomas showed a particularly high frequency of intense avh6
expression, consistent with a potentially important role for this
integrin in both the progression and invasion of oral cancers (34).
A function blocking avh6 mAb, 6.3G9, and rsTGF-hRII-Fc were
used to further define the role of avh6 in squamous cell carcinomas. Both methods of inhibiting TGF-h led to inhibition of
Detroit 562 human pharyngeal carcinoma xenograft growth in vivo,
without a direct inhibitory effect on in vitro cell growth. The results
described suggest that the in vivo growth inhibitory effects may be
mediated through both direct autocrine effects on the tumor cells
as well as indirect paracrine interactions with the tumor stromal
environment.

Materials and Methods
Antibodies and proteins. Murine avh6 mAbs, 6.3G9 and 6.4B4, used for
cell-based assays and in vivo efficacy studies, and 6.2A1, used for immunohistochemistry studies, were generated as previously described (33).
A human/mouse chimeric form of 6.2A1 (ch6.2A1), used for immunostaining tumor xenograft sections, was generated as described below. Murine
rsTGF-hRII-Fc and human soluble avh6 (hsavh6) were generated as previously described (33, 35). Human recombinant soluble TGF-h receptor
type II (rshuTGF-hRII), LAP1, TGF-h1, and latent TGF-h1 were purchased
from R&D Systems. Human plasma fibronectin was purchased from
Chemicon. Antibodies were purchased from the following vendors:
phycoerythrin-conjugated anti-av (Chemicon); goat anti-mouse IgG phycoerythrin- and horse radish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated anti-rabbit
antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch); donkey anti-goat IgG Alexa 488 and
goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes); goat anti-human TGFhRII (R&D Systems); biotinylated anti-mouse, anti-goat, and anti-human
IgG (Vector Laboratories); rabbit anti-phosphorylated Smad2/3 (p-Smad2/3;
Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.); and rabbit anti–TGF-h (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology).
Tissue collections. Paraffin-embedded human tissues were obtained
from Phenopath, Inc. Tissue arrays were purchased from Imgenex Histoarrays and from Petagen.
Cell lines and cell culture. Detroit 562 human pharyngeal cancer cells
were purchased from American Type Tissue Collection Repository and
cultured in MEM (Eagle) with Earle’s (Invitrogen), 0.1 mmol/L nonessential
amino acids (Biowhittaker), 1.0 mmol/L sodium pyruvate (Sigma), 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS; JRH Biosciences), and 2 mmol/L L-glutamine
(Mediatech). SW480h6 cells and mink lung epithelial cells transfected with
a PAI-1-luciferase reporter gene construct (TMLC) were generated and
cultured as previously described (12, 36).

avb6 Antibody Inhibits Tumor Progression In vivo
Washed sections were incubated with ABC reagent (Vector Laboratories),
for 30 min at room temperature, and 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine substrate
(Vector Laboratories). Frozen tissue sections embedded in OCT compound
(Sakura Tokyo) were fixed in acetone and blocked with 0.5% casein/0.05%
thimerosal in PBS. For immunostaining, TGF-h sections were incubated
with primary antibody and an anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 secondary
antibody. Analysis of avh6 expression used an H-score, which represents a
composite score reflecting both the intensity of staining and the percentage
of positively stained cells. The H-score represents the sum of the products of
the percentage of positive cells (0–100) and the intensity of staining scored
on a four-point scale, where 0 represents no staining above background,
1+ represents weak staining, 2+ represents moderate staining, and 3+
represents strong staining. A maximum H-score of 300 represents 100% of
cells exhibiting 3+ staining.
Analysis of integrin B6 and p-Smad2/3 protein expression. For
detecting p-Smad2/3, cells were lysed in 150 mmol/L NaCl, 20 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH 8.0), 2 mmol/L EGTA, 2% Triton X-100, and for detecting h6, cells
were lysed in 10 mmol/L HEPES, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl2 (pH 7.5), 1% Triton
X-100 each containing Complete Mini protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics). After electrophoresis and transfer, membranes were blocked and
incubated with 1:10,000 anti-pSmad2/3 or 1 Ag/mL 6.2A1, washed, and then
incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. Bands were detected
using SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce Biotechnology, Inc.).
Tumor xenograft studies. Female athymic nude mice, 6 to 8 weeks old
(Harlan Sprague-Dawley, Inc.) were used for all studies. Mice were maintained
in accordance with the Biogen Idec Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee, and city, state, and federal guidelines for the humane treatment
and care of laboratory animals. Animals were s.c. implanted (day 0)
on the right flank with 5  106 Detroit 562 cells, suspended in medium
without serum. Tumors were measured with calipers and tumor size
(mm) was converted to mg using the formula mg = (length  width 2) / 2.
Body weights were monitored throughout the course of each study.
Treatments were initiated when the tumor size reached a minimum
weight of 80 mg. Studies were run as randomized, double-blinded trials
with a vehicle control (n = 30) and treatment groups (n = 10). Antibodies
and rsTGF-hRII-Fc were administered i.p. thrice weekly (dosing every other
day). No significant effect on body weight was measured for any of the
treatment groups. Statistical comparisons were made comparing control
groups and test article using the Student’s t test.

able in carcinomas predominantly of squamous cell origin of the
cervix, skin, esophagus, and head and neck, which were positive in
92% (n = 46), 84% (n = 49), 68% (n = 56), and 64% (n = 100) of cases,
respectively (Table 1). Strong expression of avh6, defined as an
H-score >150, was observed in 63% of cervical, 50% of esophageal,
41% of skin, and 35% of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.
A statistically significant correlation between the level of avh6
expression and tumor grade and stage was not observed in our
studies. An analysis of a larger number of cases, for each tumor
type, would be required to determine if a statistically significance
relationship exists. In our studies, the n value for most of the
individual tumor types was f50 cases.
The strong expression of avh6 in malignant tissues, particularly
squamous cell carcinoma, sharply contrasts with the absent or
minimal expression observed in nonmalignant tissues (Fig. 1C, and
data not shown). In normal tissue, avh6 expression was limited to
the basal cells of occasional samples of squamous epithelium, in
some cases with associated reactive epidermal changes. There was
variable but limited expression along the colonic columnar
epithelium, by the syncytiotrophoblast cells of placental villi, and
in placental membranes (data not shown). avh6 was not detected
on any connective or neural tissue examined (data not shown).
Consistent with its restricted expression in epithelium and absence
in normal connective tissue, avh6 was not detected on any sarcomas examined (data not shown).
avh6 exhibited a unique pattern of expression in a significant
percentage of squamous cell carcinomas that was characterized by
strong staining of malignant cells located along the periphery of
nests of infiltrating tumor tissue (e.g., see Fig. 1C). These cells form
the interface with the adjacent tumor stroma. Malignant cells
located within the tumor focus exhibited reduced, and occasionally
absent, staining. This pattern was particularly prominent among
squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, where f50% of
tumors that were positive for avh6 expression exhibited this tumorstroma interface pattern of expression.
Analysis of tumor metastases derived from a wide spectrum of
primary epithelial malignancies revealed avh6 expression in 77% of
cases (n = 52; Fig. 1D). Among nine cases of primary carcinoma
( five cervical, two ovarian, one endometrial, and one thyroid) for
which a matched metastasis was available for analysis, all cases
exhibited an equivalent or higher level of expression (H-score) in
the metastatic lesion. Moreover, the metastatic tumor lesions often
exhibited the tumor-stroma interface pattern of avh6 expression
that was commonly observed in primary tumor sections. Together,
these results indicate that avh6 expression persists through a metastatic transition.
In vitro characterization of avh6 function in Detroit 562
cells. We evaluated the functional properties of avh6 on the Detroit
562 cell line, derived from a human pharyngeal squamous
carcinoma. As determined by flow cytometry, Detroit 562 cells
show significant surface expression of avh6 (Fig. 2A). Cell adhesion
assays were carried out to determine if these cells adhere to the
avh6 ligands, LAP and fibronectin, and would be inhibited by the
function blocking avh6 mAb, 6.3G9. This mAb has been previously
shown to bind selectively to avh6 with an ED50 equal to 14.5 ng/mL
(33). Cells bound to both ligands (Fig. 2B) and 10 Ag/mL of 6.3G9
inhibited adhesion to LAP by >90% and completely inhibited
adhesion to fibronectin. Because the expression of avh6 is not
always sufficient to confer the ability to activate TGF-h (13), we
tested Detroit 562 cells in a coculture system previously described
as a method to monitor avh6-mediated activation of TGF-h (13).

Results
Expression of AvB6 in squamous cell carcinomas. To characterize the expression of avh6 across a wide spectrum of human
malignant and nonmalignant tissue types, a panel of hybridoma
clones was screened for mAbs capable of recognizing the h6
subunit in immunohistochemical staining of paraffin-embedded
tissue sections. To this end, the h6 subunit was separated chromatographically from hsavh6 (12) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and
Coomassie blue staining (Fig. 1A, left). The resultant isolated and
denatured h6 was used for screening hybridoma supernatants
for antibody binding using a solid-phase ELISA (data not shown).
Murine mAb, 6.2A1, was identified and chosen for further
characterization. 6.2A1 specifically recognized h6 in immunoblots,
comparing h6-transfected SW40 cells with untransfected SW480
cells (Fig. 1A, right), and also immunostained sections of paraffinembedded h6-transfected SW40 cells but not untransfected SW480
cells (Fig. 1B). 6.2A1 bound to human avh6 with a ED50 equal to
62.9 ng/mL, and in contrast to our previously described mAbs,
6.2A1 did not inhibit ligand binding to avh6 (33).
Generation of 6.2A1 allowed for analysis of avh6 expression
across several tumor types by paraffin immunohistochemistry.
Although avh6 was clearly expressed (H-score >50) in a wide spectrum of epithelial malignancies, expression was particularly not-

Figure 1. Specificity of 6.2A1 binding to integrin h6 and immunohistochemical analysis of avh6 expression in human cancers, metastases, and normal tissue. A, the
h6 subunit was purified from hsavh6 using preparative reverse-phase HPLC, and proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue staining (left ). Lysates
from SW480h6 and SW480h6+ cells were analyzed by immunoblotting using 6.2A1 (right ). Lanes 1 to 3, SW480h6 lysate; lanes 5 to 6, SW480h6+ lysate;
and lane 7, purified hsavh6. The band at f80 kDa represents the h6 subunit. In lane 7, the higher molecular weight band (f180 kDa) represents a trace amount
of SDS-stable avh6 heterodimer, which was detected using the more sensitive immunoblotting method but was not observed using Coomassie blue staining. B, sections
of paraffin-embedded SW480h6 and SW480h6+ cell pellets immunostained with 6.2A1. SW480h6+ cells represent a nonclonal cell line and thus expression of
avh6 is variable within the cell pellet. Magnification, 400. C, immunohistochemical analysis of avh6 expression in human cancers and normal tissue. Representative
examples of strong avh6 expression in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC ) and low-level expression in normal (NL ) tissue from the indicated anatomic sites. Section
of normal tissue from larynx represents nonmalignant tissue adjacent to a site of primary squamous cell carcinoma and exhibits mild inflammation with reactive
changes. Sections of normal and malignant tissues from each site were present on the same tissue microarray (with the exception of esophagus), thus providing
identical assay conditions for comparison of expression in normal versus malignant tissue. All images were obtained at 200 magnification using identical digital image
capture variables. D, avh6 expression in metastatic tumor lesions. Metastases to lymph node (a–d ) and lung (e and f ) are shown from primary squamous cell
carcinomas of the cervix (a ), esophagus (b ), skin (c ), and head and neck (d–f ). The specific sites of the primary head and neck malignancies include tongue (d ), larynx
(e), and neck (not otherwise specified; f ). All images at 200 magnification.

forms of TGF-h1. TGF-hRI and Smad4 were expressed by Detroit
562 cells as determined by Western blot analysis (data not shown).
TGF-hRII was also expressed as determined by flow cytometry
and immunohistochemical analysis of xenograft sections (Fig. 3A
and B). The binding of anti–TGF-hRII antibody was completely
inhibited by the coincubation of rshuTGF-hRII (Fig. 3A and B).
TGF-hRI and TGF-hRII contain no mutations in Detroit 562
cells (data not shown and ref. 37). To confirm that the TGF-h1
receptors are capable of mediating intracellular signaling, we
analyzed p-Smad2/3 in the cells in response to the addition of
TGF-h1 (Fig. 3C). Addition of either the active or latent forms of
TGF-h1 induced p-Smad2/3. In keeping with the ability of avh6
to activate TGF-h, we analyzed the effect of 6.3G9 on the phosphorylation of Smad2/3 in Detroit 562 cells alone or in combination with latent or active TGF-h1. The addition of 6.3G9
significantly reduced both the basal level of p-Smad2/3 and the
phosphorylation induced by the addition of 100 ng/mL latent
TGF-h1 (Fig. 3C). As expected, 6.3G9 had no effect on p-Smad2/3

Coculture of Detroit 562 cells with TMLC led to a significant
increase in luciferase activity relative to coculture with negative
control SW480 cells (Fig. 2C). 6.3G9 and rsTGF-hRII-Fc were tested
at 10 Ag/mL for their ability to block Detroit 562–mediated TGF-h
activation. 6.3G9 reduced activation to background level, whereas
rsTGF-hRII-Fc inhibited activation by 44% (Fig. 2C). The cells
were assayed for their ability to secrete TGF-h1. Active TGF-h1
was barely detectable whereas f300 pg/mL of acid activated
latent TGF-h1 were produced in culture after 24 h as measured by
ELISA (Fig. 2D). These findings suggest that Detroit 562 cells
produce latent TGF-h1 that can be activated in an avh6–dependent
manner.
Effects of TGF-B, AvB6 mAbs, and rsTGF-BRII-Fc on Detroit
562 cellular proliferation and Smad phosphorylation in vitro.
To determine whether the TGF-h signaling pathway is intact in
Detroit 562 cells, we confirmed the expression of TGF-hRI, TGFhRII, and Smad4 protein, and evaluated the phosphorylation
status of Smad2/3 before and after treatment with latent and active

avb6 Antibody Inhibits Tumor Progression In vivo

We also tested the effects of TGF-h1 (38) on the proliferation of
Detroit 562 cells in vitro. The addition of either the active (Fig. 4A)
or latent form of TGF-h1 (Fig. 4B) led to a modest inhibition of growth. A maximum inhibition of 20% was achieved by
active TGF-h1 that was statistically significant at concentrations
z74 pg/mL (P < 0.05). A maximum inhibition of 25% was achieved
with latent TGF-h1 that was statistically significant at concentrations z195 pg/mL (P < 0.05). The addition of 6.3G9 or rsTGFhRII-Fc had no direct effects on the proliferation of Detroit 562
cells (Fig. 4C) nor did 6.3G9 block the inhibition of growth induced
by the addition of latent TGF-h1 (Fig. 4D). In similar studies,
Detroit 562 cells were cultured in collagen or Matrigel and no
significant effects of 6.3G9 on cell proliferation were observed (data
not shown). Collectively, these findings suggest that whereas avh6
can mediate TGF-h–induced intracellular signaling, it does not
seem to regulate Detroit 562 proliferation in an autocrine manner

Effect of anti-AvB6 mAbs and rsTGF-BRII-Fc on growth of
Detroit 562 cells in vivo. Detroit 562 cells grown as xenograft
tumors were evaluated for the expression of avh6 and TGF-h using
immunohistochemistry. Although the majority of cells express avh6
by flow cytometry, the xenograft tumors were found to express
avh6 predominantly at the tumor-stroma interface (Fig. 5A). This
suggests that there is further regulation of avh6 expression in vivo

inhibited both the basal level of p-Smad2/3 and that induced by the

concentrations: 2 ng/mL active TGF-h1, 100 ng/mL latent TGF-h1, 10 Ag/mL 6.3G9, and 10 Ag/mL rsTGF-hRII-Fc.

IgG2a version of 6.3G9 was generated to provide optimal effector
function in mice. In addition, an IgG2a construct with an N300Q
mutation in the CH2 domain of the mAb was generated to eliminate glycosylation of the mAb and to inhibit Fcg receptor binding as previously reported (39, 40). Similar approaches have been
taken with other mAbs to evaluate the role of effector function
in vivo (41). Wild-type and mutant aglycosylated IgG2a versions of
6.3G9 showed similar binding affinities for avh6 and blocked ligand
binding with similar potencies (data not shown). All forms of the
mAb had a similar serum half-life in vivo (data not shown). Wildtype and aglycosylated IgG2a forms of 6.3G9 produced similar
inhibitory effects, which was comparable with the inhibition of
growth detected with the parent IgG1 version of 6.3G9 (Fig. 5D).
These findings indicate that the in vivo efficacy detected with 6.3G9
is not mediated by effector function.

leading to increased expression at the tumor-stromal interface.
Immunohistochemical analysis of TGF-h in the xenograft sections
showed significant TGF-h in the surrounding stroma (Fig. 5A). We
investigated whether treatment with avh6 mAbs would inhibit
tumor growth and also tested the effect of rsTGF-hRII-Fc as an
inhibitor of the TGF-h pathway. Treatments included function
blocking avh6 mAb, 6.3G9; non–function blocking avh6 mAb, 6.4B4;
rsTGF-hRII-Fc; or vehicle control (Fig. 5B–D). In a dose ranging
study, 6.3G9 inhibited tumor growth in a dose-dependent manner
resulting in 50% inhibition at 10 mg/kg compared with vehicle
control–treated mice (n = 10, P < 0.05; Fig. 5B). Equivalent doses of
6.4B4, an antibody that binds with high affinity to avh6 but shows
minimal ligand blocking activity (33), had no effect on tumor
growth (Fig. 5C). rsTGF-hRII-Fc, at 2 mg/kg, resulted in a nearly
complete inhibition of tumor growth (n = 10, P < 0.001; Fig. 5B
and C). In four separate experiments, 6.3G9 produced a statistically
significant inhibition of tumor growth with activity ranging from
40% to 70% compared with vehicle control. Inhibition in vivo by a
function blocking avh6 mAb and rsTGF-hRII-Fc, and not by the
nonblocking avh6 mAb, suggests that blocking TGF-h activity is the
relevant mechanism of action of these molecules.
Additional xenograft studies were conducted to evaluate the
importance of antibody-mediated effector function for 6.3G9. An

Discussion
The expression of avh6 in a variety of epithelial malignancies was
analyzed using the 6.2A1 antibody. These studies showed that avh6
was most highly up-regulated in squamous cell carcinomas, where
it was found to be expressed in more than 60% of cases evaluated
of the head and neck, esophagus, cervix, and skin, thus further

blocking avh6 in vivo. In vitro, the function blocking avh6 mAb,
6.3G9, inhibited latent TGF-h–induced Smad2/3 phosphorylation
in Detroit 562 cells, but had no direct effect on proliferation.
However, in vivo, both 6.3G9 and rsTGF-hRII-Fc significantly inhibited Detroit 562 tumor growth. Because the inhibitory effects of
mAbs on tumor growth in vivo can be mediated at least in part by
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (41, 46), we generated an
IgG2a version of 6.3G9 with an N300Q mutation in the CH2 domain
of the mAb. Glycosylation of this domain mediates Fcg receptor
binding and is inhibited by this mutation, subsequently attenuating antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (39, 40). These studies
revealed that the ability of 6.3G9 to inhibit tumor growth in vivo
was not related to effector function as the wild-type and mutant
forms of the antibody had equivalent effects on tumor growth. The
difference in the degree of tumor growth inhibition observed
comparing 6.3G9 and rsTGF-hRII-Fc may reflect the extent of
TGF-h inhibition by the different therapeutics. rsTGF-hRII has the
potential to inhibit all active TGF-h present in the stromal compartment, whereas 6.3G9 is limited to inhibition of TGF-h activation at the epithelial tumor-stromal interface.

validating and extending previous reports of avh6 in human
carcinomas (6, 9–11, 42). In addition, 77% of metastatic lesions,
representing a range of tumor types that had metastasized to
different tissues, were found to overexpress avh6. An association of
avh6 expression with clinical variables such as disease progression,
metastases, and survival has been described (9, 11, 42, 43). However, although a correlation between avh6 expression and tumor
grade and stage has been reported in cervical squamous cell
carcinomas (11), no correlation was found to exist in other studies
analyzing different tumor types (42, 44, 45). These differences may
relate in part to the sample size evaluated or reflect real differences
among the various tumor types. Collectively, these findings support
the hypothesis that avh6 may facilitate tumor progression, invasion, and metastasis, and may represent a prognostic marker in
certain tumor types.
We observed increased expression of avh6 on head and neck
carcinomas particularly at the invasive edge where tumor cells are
in direct contact with the tumor-associated stroma. Similar leading
edge expression was found in the Detroit 562 xenograft tumors,
thus offering an attractive model to study functional effects of

in no difference in avh6 expression as determined by flow cytometry (data not shown). However, immunostaining of Detroit 562
xenograft tissue for smooth muscle actin and collagen (Sirius red
stain) consistently exhibited a more reticular pattern of expression
along the periphery of the xenograft tumor (data not shown),
similar to the localized expression of avh6 on the leading edges of
the same tumors. These observations are consistent with a correlation between avh6 expression and spatial characteristics of the
associated matrix. Similarly, staining of human oral carcinoma
revealed smooth muscle actin staining on the invasive front of the
tumors at the same locations where avh6 expression was detected.
Although we observed this pattern of expression in both xenografts
and human primary tumors, no clear differences in collagen and
smooth muscle actin staining was observed in the xenograft studies
comparing the different treatment groups. Additionally, no difference in angiogenesis, as determined by CD31 immunostaining,
was detected (data not shown). It is possible that avh6 plays a role

The avh6 integrin not only mediates TGF-h activation, but has
also been reported to regulate intracellular signaling upon binding
to extracellular matrix ligands. In vitro and in vivo studies have
suggested that avh6 binding to fibronectin can promote migration,
invasion, matrix metalloproteinase production, and metastases
through fyn and extracellular signal-regulated kinase/mitogenactivated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways (16, 34, 47).
Our studies evaluating the role of avh6 mediating intracellular
signaling through MAPK and AKT did not reveal direct effects of
blocking avh6 with mAbs on these downstream events in Detroit
562 cells in vitro (data not shown). Our findings suggest that the
in vivo tumor inhibitory effects of blocking avh6 or TGF-h may be
mediated in part through paracrine effects involving the tumor
microenvironment. The predominant expression of avh6 on the
leading edge of tumors suggests that expression may be mediated
by matrix interactions. In vitro culture of Detroit 562 cells in the
presence of collagen I, collagen IV, laminin, or fibronectin resulted

this is underscored by the known homeostatic roles of the TGF-h
pathway in regulating inflammation, immune tolerance, and tumor
suppression (22, 23, 48, 49). A comparison of the genetic null
phenotypes for avh6 and TGF-h, and conditional TGF-h pathway null mice, further supports the hypothesis that blocking
avh6-mediated TGF-h activation may be preferable to global
targeting of the TGF-h pathway in disease. Mice completely
deficient for avh6 function develop normally and have a typical
lifespan, with mild inflammation that is limited to the lung and
skin, and with late-onset emphysema (50). In contrast, TGF-h–
deficient mice that do not die in utero show severe inflammation in
multiple organ systems, resulting in death at 3 to 4 weeks of age,
and conditional TGF-h pathway null mice have been associated
with significantly increased tumorigenesis (23, 48, 49, 51, 52).
Thus, avh6 blocking mAbs provide an opportunity to inhibit
tumor growth and minimize the potential for tumor promoting
and pro-inflammatory activity that could be associated with
systemic blockade of TGF-h.

in tumor progression in vivo through its proinvasion properties
(17, 20, 21). The ability of avh6 to promote tumor cell invasion into
the surrounding stroma may induce a growth-permissive environment. We found that Detroit 562 cells invade in vitro and this
activity is blocked by the addition of avh6 mAbs (data not shown).
It is possible that in vivo, the avh6 blocking mAb is affecting tumor
progression through direct effects on the invasive properties of the
tumor cells. This would be consistent with the predominant
expression of avh6 on the leading invasive edge of the Detroit 562
tumor xenografts. It has been shown that TGF-h can promote
increased expression of avh6 (7). Consequently, avh6 expressed on
tumors provides a mechanism for local activation of TGF-h, which
can, in turn, further drive increased avh6 expression in vivo. This
could create a self-sustaining positive-feedback loop leading to
maintenance of TGF-h activation in a localized manner. In support of this concept, we found that expression of avh6 on Detroit
562 xenograft tumors was nearly completely down-modulated by
in vivo treatment with rsTGF-hRII-Fc (data not shown). In the
xenograft model, it is possible that 6.3G9 disrupts a feedback loop
by inhibiting TGF-h activation, and rsTGF-hRII-Fc could do so by
blocking TGF-h directly.
avh6 expression is minimal to negligible in most normal tissues
but highly up-regulated on epithelial tumors and metastases. Thus,
avh6 mAbs provide an approach for localized suppression of
TGF-h, which could otherwise be a major limitation to the use
of systemic inhibitors of the TGF-h pathway. The importance of
