ABSTRACT
A single nucleotide polymorphism (T to G) in the mdm2 P2 promoter, mdm2
SNP309, leads to MDM2 overexpression promoting chemotherapy resistant cancers.
Two mdm2 G/G SNP309 cancer cell lines, MANCA and A875, have compromised wildtype p53 that co-localizes with MDM2 on chromatin. We hypothesized that MDM2 in
these cells inhibited transcription initiation at the p53 target genes p21 and puma.
Surprisingly, following etoposide treatment transcription initiation occurred at the
compromised target genes in MANCA and A875 cells similar to the T/T ML-1 cell line.
In all cell lines tested there was equally robust recruitment of total and initiated RNA
polymerase II (Pol II). We found that knockdown of MDM2 in G/G cells moderately
increased expression of subsets of p53 target genes without increasing p53 stability.
Importantly, etoposide and actinomycin D treatments increased histone H3K36
trimethylation in T/T, but not G/G cells, suggesting a G/G correlated inhibition of
transcription elongation. We therefore tested a chemotherapeutic agent (8-aminoadenosine) that induces p53-independent cell death for higher clinically relevant
cytotoxicity. We demonstrated that T/T and G/G mdm2 SNP309 cells were equally
sensitive to 8-amino-adenosine induced cell death. In conclusion for cancer cells
overexpressing MDM2, targeting MDM2 may be less effective than inducing p53independent cell death.

of p53 is the protein MDM2. The overexpression of
MDM2 is found in multiple tumor types (see reviews
[8, 9]). Therapies targeting the MDM2-p53 interaction
are in development and considered to be promising (see
reviews [10, 11]). However, it remains unclear if such
therapies will be the most clinically relevant in all settings
in which MDM2 is overexpressed.
MDM2 inhibits p53 activity by multiple
mechanisms. MDM2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets
p53 for proteasomal degradation [12] and can also inhibit
p53 transactivation function on chromatin [13–16].
Increasing evidence demonstrates that MDM2 E3 ligase
activity is controled by post-translational modifications
on multiple domains of the polypeptide indicating that
alterative MDM2 functions can coexist based on the
kinase profile and splicing dynamics of the cell [17–20].

INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapeutic agents that damage DNA activate
the p53 pathway and can initiate cancer cell death [1, 2].
However, chemoresistant cancers often have sustained
changes that block activation of the p53 pathway either
by missense mutations in p53 or by overexpression
of MDM2 [3]. The wild-type p53 protein is a tumor
suppressor referred to as the “guardian of the genome” [4].
Under cellular stress conditions, such as DNA damage,
wild-type p53 becomes activated and stabilized [5, 6].
The p53 protein functions as a transcription factor to
induce transcriptional targets involved in activating cell
cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair and senescence (see
reviews [6, 7]). Multiple proteins are involved in p53
regulation but one of the most critical negative regulators

The mdm2 gene itself is a transcriptional target of p53 and
therefore p53 and MDM2 form a negative feedback loop
[21–23]. The importance of the MDM2-p53 interaction is
highlighted by the fact that the knockout of the mdm2 gene
in mice is embryonic lethal and is rescued by additonal
knockout of p53 [24]. MDM2 overexpression in cancers
is associated with mdm2 genomic amplification, increased
transcription and enhanced translation [25–28]. One
mechanism for increased transcription of mdm2 is through
a single nucleotide polymorphism at position 309 (mdm2
SNP309) in which a thymine to guanine change increases
recruitment of the transcription factor Sp1 to the genes P2
promoter [29]. Patients characterized as homozygous G/G
mdm2 SNP309 often have accelerated tumor formation,
earlier age of cancer onset and increased incidence of
multiple types of cancers [29, 30].
Human cancer cell lines that are G/G mdm2 SNP309
are resistant to standard chemotherapeutic DNA damaging
agents and have compromised p53 transcriptional activity
after DNA damage treatment [14, 31]. Two human G/G
SNP309 cancer cell lines, MANCA and A875, have
stable wild-type p53 that is compromised for activation
of multiple p53 target genes and forms MDM2-p53
chromatin complexes at p53 response elements [14].
MDM2 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity through
dual mechanisms by binding to the p53 transactivation
domain and TFIIE to inhibit the pre-initiation complex
[13, 32]. However, recent evidence indicates that
across the human genome silenced genes contain RNA
polymerase II in functional pre-initiation complexes
poised to begin transcription [33]. One p53 target gene,
p21, can have blocked transcriptional elongation during
an S-phase checkpoint [34–36], which may allow for
rapid re-activation of the p53 pathway. In addition, the
expression of MDM2 in SNP309 cancer cells also has
p53-independent oncogenic activities [37, 38]. The list of
p53-independent functions for MDM2 is increasing, with
recent reports indicating that MDM2 has p53-independent
transcription regulatory functions in Akt signaling [39].
This growing list suggests that overexpressed MDM2
might function to block activation of p53-mediated
transcription in ways yet to be determined that do not
require inhibition of transcription initiation. Alternatively,
the overexpression of MDM2 from G/G SNP309 may be
linked to other genetic or epigenetic changes that have not
yet been identified.
In this study we explored the role of G/G SNP309
MDM2 overexpression on wild-type p53 transcriptional
activity at p21 and puma target genes. We tested if stable
knockdown of MDM2 in G/G SNP309 cancer cells
could reactivate wild-type p53. We found that MDM2
knockdown had a moderate activation effect on specific
p53 target genes, including puma, in the absence of DNA
damage treatment but did not induce p21. Importantly, in
the presence of DNA damage, MANCA and A875 cells

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

had functional transcription initiation at the p53 target
genes p21 and puma but had compromised transcriptional
elongation. We found it difficult to reactivate the initiated
wild-type p53 causing us to ask the clinically relevant
question of what is the best way to reduce the viability of
G/G SNP309 cancer cells?
Inducers of p53-independent cell death can work
on multiple cancer types with or without p53 mutations,
therefore activating p53-independent cell death is
potentially more clinically relevant than inhibiting the
MDM2 pathway [40–42]. Many cancers overexpress
MDM2, but also express mutant p53 that is unable to
activate the transcription of death inducing target genes
[38, 43, 44]. For example, many triple negative breast
cancers express high MDM2 as well as mutant p53
[45]. We have recently found that triple negative breast
cancers with mutant p53 are killed effectively by the
p53-independent death inducer called 8-amino-adenosine
(8AA) [41]. The cytotoxic effects of 8AA occur by
inhibiting RNA metabolism, reducing the pools of ATP,
and blocking Akt/mTOR signaling [46]. Actinomycin D
which represses RNA Pol1 activity and reduces rRNA
transcription, at extremely low doses can directly inhibit
MDM2 by releasing ribosomal proteins that inhibit
MDM2 thereby activating the p53 pathway [47]. To date
no study has been undertaken to compare how cells with
overexpressed MDM2 through mdm2 SNP309 are killed
by activation of p53-dependent versus p53-independent
pathways. In theory, G/G mdm2 SNP309 cells that express
wild-type p53 should be killed by blocking MDM2.
However, in practice cancers are polymorphic and G/G
mdm2 SNP309 cancers may select for additional pathways
to inactive wild-type p53. Recent evidence implicates
the activation of MDMX as an alternative mechanism
for cancers to inactive the wild-type p53 pathway
[48, 49]. In MDM2 overexpressing cancers, it may be
more clinically relevant to initiate p53-independent cell
death pathways because it is unclear how high-level wildtype p53 mediated transcriptional activation is blocked.
When cancers are resistant to standard chemotherapy
it is important to consider alternative targeting options.
Cancers with high MDM2 are sometimes, but not always,
sensitive to small molecule chemotherapeutics disrupting
the p53-MDM2 interaction (see reviews [11, 40]).
Non-genotoxic small molecule inhibitors targeting this
interaction such as Nutlin-3 are reported to have some
efficacy in cancers with MDM2 overexpression [40, 50].
Interestingly, herein we found that knockdown of MDM2
was not able to induce death in G/G SNP309 cancer cells,
suggesting the need to determine other targeted treatments
for such MDM2 overexpressing cancers. Specific
activation of wild-type p53 by low dose actinomycin D
treament has been suggested as a clinically relevant
treatment option for cancers with high MDM2 [51].
However, we found that while actinomycin D treatment

increased p53 levels in G/G SNP309 cancer cells, this
treatment did not substantially decrease cell viability.
Interestingly, we observed that the nucleoside analogue
8AA, which activates p53–independent cell death
pathways [41], was more cytotoxic to G/G SNP309
cancer cells than etoposide or actinomycin D suggesting
it is a viable option for cancers with dysfunctional
p53. Cancers with wild-type p53 and high MDM2 are
potentially well suited as candidates for treatments
targeted at p53-independent death pathways. Synthetic
lethal p53-independent cell death pathways are emerging
as important targets for multiple cancer types [52]. In the
clinical setting, activation of p53-independent cell death
pathways may be the best target for mdm2 G/G SNP309
cancers.

genes. We observed some MDM2 recruitment in ML-1
cells at p21 and puma genes that associated with the large
increase in p53 recruitment (Figure 1C). Importantly, at
the p21 gene there was a significant increase in MDM2
recruitment in MANCA cells after DNA damage
corresponding to the increased p53 (Figure 1C). This trend
was also seen at the puma gene (Figure 1C). A875 cells
also displayed a trend of increased MDM2 recruitment
that corresponded to the p53 recruitment for both genes
(Figure 1C). To compare overall levels of p53 and MDM2
on chromatin, we performed a chromatin fractionation and
western blot analysis. We observed that in ML-1, MANCA
and A875 cells etoposide treatment caused increased p53
protein levels on the chromatin (Figure 1D). Interestingly,
MANCA cells had the highest basal levels of p53 on the
chromatin. Additionally, MANCA and A875 cells had
higher basal levels of MDM2 protein on the chromatin
compared to ML-1 cells (Figure 1D). These data were in
keeping with our previous findings [14] and suggested that
stable knockdown of MDM2 in G/G SNP309 cells would
result in activation of p53 target genes.

RESULTS
Cancer cell lines with the G/G SNP309 genotype
have compromised transcription of p53 target
genes

MDM2 knockdown in G/G SNP309 cancer cells
moderately increases p53 transcriptional activity
without affecting p53 degradation

We compared p53 signaling in MDM2 SNP309 T/T
and G/G genotype cells by using the previously documented
model of comparison of ML-1, MANCA and A875 human
cancer cell lines [14, 29]. ML-1 cells, a myeloid leukemia,
have functional wild-type p53 and basal MDM2 protein
expression with a T/T mdm2 SNP309 genotype [29].
MANCA and A875 cell lines, a Burkitt’s lymphoma
and melanoma (respectively), have compromised wildtype p53 and overexpression of MDM2 due to the G/G
mdm2 SNP309 genotype [29]. MANCA and A875
cancer cells, compared to ML-1 cells, have compromised
p53 transcriptional activity [14]. Using the established
DNA damage conditions, we compared MANCA and
A875 cells to ML-1 cells for activation of the previously
investigated p21 gene and for the first time the apoptotic
target puma. As expected, DNA damage induced by 8 μM
etoposide treatment in ML-1 cells stimulated robust p21
and puma transcription. However, activation of p21 was
significantly less abundant in MANCA (p = 0.00015) and
A875 (p = 0.00015) cells than observed in ML-1 cells.
This was also observed for activation of puma in MANCA
(p = 0.00018) and A875 (p = 0.002) cells (Figure 1A).
These data supported our previous findings that cells with
mdm2 G/G SNP309 have compromised wild-type p53
activity.
DNA damage induced recruitment of p53 and MDM2
to the promoter regions of the two target genes in the three
cell lines (Figure 1). The highest level of p53 recruitment
was found in ML-1 cells at the p21 promoter region
(Figure 1B). Etoposide treatment increased p53 recruitment
in MANCA and A875 cells at the p21 and puma genes p53
responsive elements (p53REs) (Figure 1B). MANCA cells
displayed significant increases in p53 recruitment after
DNA damage for p21 (p = 0.005) and puma (p = 0.023)

In order to directly test the influence of MDM2 on
p53 protein levels and activity in G/G SNP309 cancer
cells we constructed MANCA and A875 stable mir30based mdm2 shRNA knockdown cell lines (Figure 2A).
We observed a significant knockdown of 80 to 90% of
MDM2 protein (Figures 2A and 2B). In MANCA cells,
this resulted in a moderate and significant increase in p53
protein levels (Figures 2A and 2B). In A875 cells, there
was a trend of increased p53 protein levels (Figures 2A
and 2B). Surprisingly, the reduction of MDM2 did not
translate into a global increase in transcription of p53
target genes as indicated by quantitative RT-PCR analysis
of transcripts of five common p53 targets (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, there was a cell type specific increase in
subsets of transcripts. Stable MDM2 knockdown in
MANCA cells increased puma by 4.5 fold and pig 3
by 1.7 fold (Figure 2C). In A875 cells, the knockdown
of MDM2 increased fas by 2.6 fold, pig 3 by 2.9 fold
and puma by 1.4 fold (Figure 2C). When MANCA and
A875 cells with MDM2 knockdown were treated with
etoposide for six hours, there was no additive effect
on activation of the p53 target genes (data not shown).
These data indicate that subsets of p53 target genes are
sensitive to MDM2 knockdown in a cell-type specific
manner and that inhibition of the p21 target gene’s
transcription is strongly programmed.
MDM2 is known to be involved in mediating p53
degradation through the ubiquitin proteasome pathway
[12]. However, in G/G SNP309 cancer cells degradation of
p53 is not robust. We reasoned that if MDM2 knockdown

were blocking ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation
then addition of the proteasome inhibitor MG132 would
increase p53 levels. In order to directly test this, we
used MANCA cells because with MDM2 knockdown
they had a significant increase in p53 protein levels. We
treated MANCA cells with and without MDM2 shRNA
knockdown with 10 μM MG132. The addition of MG132
increased the overall pool of ubiquitinated protein (Figures
2D and 2E) and increased MDM2 protein levels confirming
that MDM2 is a target of the ubiquitin-proteosome
pathway [53] (Figure 2D compare lanes 1 and 2 to lanes
3 and 4). MDM2 can function as an E3-ubiquitin ligase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

for itself [54] and our data suggest this may be the case
in MANCA cells. Interestingly, MG132 treatment did
not significantly increase p53 protein levels (Figure  2D
compare lanes 1 and 3 and see Figure 2E). Moreover the
combined MDM2 knockdown and MG132 treatment did
not result in increased p53 protein levels compared to
MDM2 knockdown alone (Figure 2D, compare lanes 2 and
4 and see Figure 2E). This demonstrated that in MANCA
cells MDM2 is not targeting p53 for ubiquitin- mediated
degradation. The increased p53 that occurred following
MDM2 knockdown must result from an alternative
mechanism.

G/G SNP309 cancer cells have functional
transcription initiation of p53 target genes after
DNA damage

elongation factor P-TEFb, CDK9, was recruited to p21
and puma genes. CDK9 phosphorylates the CTD of
RNA Pol II primarily at serine on position two (serine 2)
of its heptapeptide sequence, thereby transitioning the
transcription machinery into productive transcriptional
elongation [55]. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation
analysis, we observed that ML-1, MANCA and A875
cell lines had comparable CDK9 recruitment at p21 and
puma transcription start sites (TSS) after DNA damage
(Figure 4A). This indicated that CDK9 was available to
promote transcription elongation. We also examined the
recruitment of the elongating phospho-serine 2 CTD RNA
Pol II. Since phosphorylation of serine 2 on RNA Pol II
CTD increases toward the 3’ end of genes [57], we looked
at regions of p21 (+7011) and puma (+6014) genes located
near exon 3. In ML-1 cells, etoposide treatment caused
a significant increase in phospho-serine 2 RNA Pol II
recruitment (Figure 4B). In etoposide treated MANCA
and A875 cells, downstream of p21 and puma TSS, we
also detected an increased recruitment of phospho-serine
2 RNA Pol II (Figure 4B). These cell lines displayed
trends of increased elongating Pol II recruitment after
DNA damage and a significant increase on the p21 gene
in MANCA cells (Figure 4B). However, the level of full
length transcript from both the p21 and puma genes was
compromised (Figure 1A).
To further analyze the elongation signature at the
chromatin level, we compared histone H3 Lysine 36
trimethylation (H3K36me3), a histone post-translational
modification mark associated with active transcriptional
elongation [58]. H3K36me3 has also been linked to
communication between chromatin and pre-mRNA
processing which can influence the rate of transcription
[59–61]. We expected that following DNA damage in
ML-1 cells we would detect an increase in H3K36me3
that would correlate with the activated transcription of
p53 target genes. We observed that at the TSS for p21
and puma genes there was an increase in H3K36me3 in
ML-1 cells after DNA damage treatment (Figure 4C).
In comparison to ML-1 cells after etoposide treatment,
MANCA and A875 cells showed a strong trend of less
H3K36me3 at p21 and puma genes (Figure 4C). A large
difference in the means was observed when comparing
H3K36me3 between ML-1 and MANCA and between
ML-1 and A875 after DNA damage. Together the data
show that MANCA and A875 produce less full-length
p21 and puma mRNA and this correlates with a decrease
in H3K36me3. This indicated that although transcription
initiation was intact and some elongation marks were
maintained the rate of elongation was slower and might
have been influenced by an H3K36me3 signature.
To further explore the nature of the H3K36me3
signature we addressed the influence of stable MDM2
knockdown on the chromatin recruitment of p53 and
H3K36me3 on the p21 and puma genes. In MANCA cells,

In G/G SNP309 cancer cells, chemoresistance to
DNA damage and attenuated p53 function are linked [29].
This attenuated wild-type p53 function is likely due to
compromised p53 transcriptional activity [14]. Therefore,
we asked if in G/G SNP309 cells after DNA damage there
was compromised transcription initiation. In order to
test this we compared the recruitment of RNA Pol II in
ML-1 cells to the recruitment of Pol II seen in MANCA
and A875 cells before and after etoposide treatment. In
ML-1 cells, at the transcription start sites of both the
p21 and puma genes there was an increase in total RNA
Pol II recruitment (Figure 3A). Importantly, etoposide
treatment also increased RNA Pol II recruitment in
MANCA cells (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the basal RNA
Pol II recruitment in A875 cells was high before DNA
damage treatment and etoposide treatment did not cause
a substantial increase (Figure 3A). We determined with
statistical analysis that after etoposide treatment all cell
lines tested had comparable RNA Pol II recruitment at
p21 and puma transcription start sites (Figure 3A). These
data indicated that MANCA and A875 cells had functional
transcription initiation for p21 and puma target genes.
To further confirm that etoposide treatment in
SNP309 G/G cells resulted in transcription initiation we
analyzed the recruitment of an initiated form of RNA
Pol II. The C-terminal (CTD) tail of RNA Pol II consists
of 52 heptapeptide (YSPTSPS) repeats, which when
phosphorylated at position 5 (serine 5) represent an
initiated form of Pol II (see reviews [55, 56]). We observed
that following etoposide treatment there was a comparable
recruitment of phosphorylated serine 5 RNA Pol II in ML-1
and MANCA cells at both p21 and puma genes (Figure
3B). As seen with total RNA Pol II recruitment, there was
high basal recruitment of the phosphorylated serine 5 RNA
Pol II in A875 cells for p21 and puma genes (Figure 3B).
Additionally, there was a significant increase in the
initiated form of RNA Pol II after DNA damage in A875
cells at the puma gene (Figure 3B). These data provided
evidence that despite compromised transactivation of
p21 and puma in G/G mdm2 SNP309 cells, both genes
demonstrated functional transcription initiation.

recruitment at the puma (p = 0.085) gene (Figure 5A). The
correlation between G/G SNP309 and reduced H3K36me3
led us to ask if MDM2 knockdown could reverse the
epigenetic phenotype. Upon depletion of MDM2, we did

This indicated that while high MDM2 levels were directly
related to reduced p53 recruitment it might not be directly
involved in the inhibition of H3K36me3 recruitment. Our

via MDM2 binding to ribosomal proteins released from
the nucleolus and preventing p53 degradation [51, 64].
We compared MANCA and A875 cells treated with 5nM
actinomycin D for 24 hours to MANCA and A875 cells
with MDM2 knockdown (Figure 6). Actinomycin D
treated MANCA and A875 cells had a robust increase in
p53 protein levels as compared to cells with no treatment
(Figure 6A lanes 1 and 2, 7 and 8). Interestingly, MANCA
cells with MDM2 knockdown had p53 protein at lower
levels as compared to actinomycin D treatment alone
(Figure 6A, compare lanes 2 and 5). In A875 cells treated
with actinomycin D, the levels of p53 remained about the
same with or without MDM2 knockdown (Figure 6A,
compare lanes 8 and 11). Actinomycin D treatment failed
to reduce the viability of A875 cells as assessed by the

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

MTT assay; and the same assay showed a 50% decrease
in MANCA cell mitochondrial activity (Figure 6B). In
keeping with the MTT assay, microscopic examination
demonstrated that while actinomycin D treated MANCA
cells were unhealthy and stopped aggregating, the A875
cells remained healthy (Figure 6C). This provides further
evidence that simply increasing the level of p53 is not
sufficient to kill chemoresistant MDM2 overexpressing
cancer cells.
The nucleoside analog 8-amino-adenosine (8AA),
interferes with general transcription and RNA metabolism
in a p53-independent manner [41, 65]. We asked if treating

reduce cell viability better than traditional p53 reactivation
mechanisms. MANCA and A875 cells were treated with

support our the data in Figure 4 showing that MANCA
and A875 cells had compromised elongation associated
with lower H3K36me3 at p53 target genes transcription
start sites. However there were large variables in the
increase of H3K36me3 in ML-1 cells after treatment,
with results from two independent experiments indicating
that H3K36me3 increased from approximately 3 to 300
fold for the p21 gene (Figure 7C represented by error
bars). This also occurred for the puma gene displaying
an approximate 1.5 to 100 fold increase over the control
(Figure 7C represented by error bars).
When we compared the outcomes of cells treated
with actinomycin D to 8AA, we again documented that
the 8AA-induced p53-independent cell death pathway
was the most cytotoxic in both T/T and G/G cells. Using
an MTT assay, we saw that 8AA caused major significant
reductions in mitochondrial activity in ML-1, MANCA
and A875 cells (Figure 7D). While actinomycin D
treatment was not as effective at reducing mitochondrial
activity (Figure 7D). These results clearly indicated that
for G/G or T/T cells 8AA was the more effective death
activator. In order to observe if 8AA was killing cells
through an apoptotic pathway, we performed an Annexin
V apoptotic assay followed by flow cytometry. Annexin
V is an early marker for apoptosis [66]. Therefore, we
compared an early time point of 16 hours of treatment
of ML-1, MANCA and A875 cells with 8AA compared
to actinomycin D. In ML-1 cells, we observed that this
time point for 8AA was even too late to catch early
apoptotic markers and that all cells were completely
dead (Figure 7E). This corresponded to the observation
that there was no actin staining observed for these very
dead cells. Overall, we can conclude that 8AA is the most
effective at killing T/T and G/G SNP309 cancer cells.
These data indicate we should consider p53-independent
cell death pathways as primary treatment options.

a concentration of 8AA previously reported to activate
cell death in several metastatic breast cancer cells [41].
The p53 protein levels in the treated cells did not increase
with 8AA treatment (Figure 6A lanes 1 and 3; 7 and 9).
We observed that 8AA treated MANCA and A875 cell
lines had a significant reduction in mitochondrial activity
and looked sick when examined by light microscopy
(Figures 6B and 6C). The knockdown of MDM2 protein,
in addition to 8AA treatment, did not significantly alter
cell viability. This finding suggested that inducing p53independent cell death in MDM2 overexpressing cells
might be the best strategy for G/G SNP309 cancers with
compromised wild-type p53 function.

Comparison of 8AA and low dose actinomycin
D for activation of death in T/T and G/G mdm2
SNP309 cancer cells
We compared T/T and G/G mdm2 SNP309 cancer
cells for their outcomes after treatment with low dose
actinomycin D or 8AA in order to compare p53dependent versus p53-independent cell death (Figure 7).
We observed that low dose actinomycin D treatment
activated transcription of the p53 target genes p21 and
puma in T/T ML-1 cells, but not in the G/G MANCA or
A875 cells (Figure 7A). Furthermore, 8AA did not activate
p53 target gene transcription and in some cases caused
a decrease (Figure 7A). To determine if the increase in
p53 transcriptional activity correlated with stabilized p53
protein, we performed western blot analysis on whole cell
extracts for control and actinomycin D treated cells (Figure
7B). For actinomycin D treatment, no direct correlation
was observed between p53 levels and activation of
transcription, which recapitulated the data shown in
Figure 1. Actinomycin D increased p53 protein levels in
ML-1, MANCA, and A875 cells (Figure 7B, compare
lane 1 to 2, lane 4 to 5, and lane 7 to 8 respectively).
However transcription was only activated in ML-1 cells
(Figure 7A). Therefore, compared to T/T ML-1 cells, G/G
SNP309 MANCA and A875 cells displayed compromised
transcription of p53 target genes. The molecular weight
of the p53 bands in ML-1 extract were reproducibly
lower than expected, while the p53 in MANCA and A875
cells was the predicted size (Figure 7B, lanes 2, 5 and 8).
Importantly, 8AA treated cells lacked activation of p53
again indicating that the drug worked p53-independently
(Figure 7B, lanes 3, 6, and 9).
Our observation of compromised transcription in
MANCA and A875 cells after actinomycin D treatment
led us to ask if this was due to compromised elongation
associated with lower levels of H3K36 trimethylation at
transcription start sites (as seen with etoposide treatment in
Figure 4). As expected, after actinomycin D treatment we
only observed increases in H3K36me3 in ML-1 cells and
not in MANCA and A875 cells (Figure 7C). These data

DISCUSSION
In cancers with the G/G SNP309 genotype the
overexpression of MDM2 causes MDM2-p53 chromatin
complexes that we hypothesized would inhibit wildtype p53 mediated transcription initiation [14]. Herein
we explored how MDM2 (in G/G SNP309 MANCA
and A875 cells) contributed to the compromised
transcriptional regulation at p53 target genes. Using
chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments we found
that the recruitment of p53 to the chromatin caused a
recruitment of total and initiated RNA Pol II (Figures 1
and 3). This indicated that the overexpression of
MDM2 from the G/G SNP309 genotype did not inhibit
transcription initiation. Increased p53 associated with
chromatin is able to activate transcription initiation but
not transcription elongation at the p21 gene during the
activation of an S phase checkpoint [34–36]. Interestingly,

chromatin remodeling enzymes, histone modifying
enzymes and RNA Pol II involved in transcription
elongation checkpoint control are linked to multiple
diseases including cancer [72]. We asked if increases
in H3K36me3 correlated to moderate increases in
transcription of p53 target genes in MANCA cells with
MDM2 knockdown, which would suggest more active
transcriptional elongation. We observed that MDM2
knockdown did not significantly change H3K36me3
at p21 and puma transcription start sites (Figure 5B).
Therefore, our data showed that in G/G SNP309 cancer
cells MDM2 knockdown was not sufficient to reactivate
p53-dependent transcriptional elongation associated with
increased H3K36me3.
Although MDM2 is mainly known as an
E3-ubiquitin ligase for p53 degradation [12], we observed
in the G/G SNP309 cancer cell lines that the excess MDM2
did not lead to decreased p53 protein levels by degradation
(Figure 2 and [14]). Interestingly, only MANCA cells had
a small significant increase in p53 protein levels with
MDM2 knockdown (Figure 2B). We addressed if this was
through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by treating
MANCA cells with MG132 and showed that MDM2
did not increase p53 proteasome-dependent degradation
(Figure 2D and E). This demonstrated that MDM2 was
not functioning as an E3-ubiquitin ligase for p53 in G/G
SNP309 cancer cells. Therefore, MDM2 might regulate
p53 translation by indirect mechanisms. For example,
MDM2 functions as an E3-ligase for RPL26 promoting
its rapid degradation and thereby causes attenuation of
p53 mRNA translation [73]. The RING finger domain of
MDM2 also directly binds p53 mRNA and enhances p53
translation [74] and the phosphorylation of serine 395 on
MDM2 by ATM is necessary for this p53 mRNA-MDM2
interaction [75]. The data presented herein suggests that
MDM2 overexpression in G/G SNP309 cancer cells
influences the p53 protein level through one of these
alternative regulation paradigms.
MDM2 may influence alternative splicing and
is itself alternatively spliced [38, 76]. An increase in
mdm2 splice variants and protein isoforms are a common
occurrence in cancer cells with MDM2 overexpression
(see reviews [38, 77]). Multiple mdm2 splice variants are
found in G/G SNP309 cancer cell lines [78]. The common
mdm2 splice variants found in MDM2 overexpressing
cancers express mRNAs that encode polypeptides
missing portions of the p53 binding domain, but retain the
RING finger domain [77]. Importantly, the G/G SNP309
MANCA cells express high levels of the mdm2-C splice
transcript as well as high levels of MDM2-C protein [79].
MDM2-C does not increase wild-type p53 degradation
or decrease p53 transcriptional activity but rather has
p53-independent transforming ability [79]. Therefore,
it is possible that knockdown of MDM2 protein in the
G/G SNP309 cells did not significantly increase the p53

MDM2 induces replication stress eliciting an early
intra-S-phase checkpoint response [67]. In p53-null
H1299 lung carcinoma cells with inducible wild-type p53
the expression of excess full-length MDM2 selectively
inhibits p53 target genes pig-3 and 14–3-3σ [68]. We
found that stable knockdown of MDM2 moderately
increased select p53 target genes in a cell-type specific
manner and no additive activation was observed after
DNA damage treatment (Figure 2C and data not shown).
Our data combined with the published reports on blocks to
transcription elongation of p53 target genes after initiation
indicate that a complex relationship occurs between p53
protein levels, transcription initiation, and p53-dependent
transcriptional regulation. It also suggests that MDM2
may influence transcriptional elongation.
MDM2 inhibits p53-mediated transcription via
dual mechanisms by binding to the p53 transactivation
domain and also binding to the basal transcription factor
TFIIE thereby inhibiting the pre-initiation complex
[13, 32]. Our data conflicts with this understanding
which was established using an in vitro system devoid
of chromatin [32]. We observed that G/G SNP309
MDM2 overexpressing cells had functional transcription
initiation when treated with the DNA damaging agent
etoposide (Figure 3). Therefore, we evaluated markers of
transcription elongation in the G/G SNP309 cancer cells
to determine if transcription elongation was inhibited
(Figure 4). Decreased H3K36me3 associates with
decreased transcription elongation [58]. Interestingly, G/G
SNP309 A875 and MANCA etoposide and actinomycin D
treated cells (when compared to ML-1 T/T treated cells)
displayed dramatically lower H3K36me3 for both the p21
and puma genes near transcription start sites (Figures 4C
and 7C). Interestingly, two other markers of transcription
elongation (RNA Pol II serine-2 and CDK9 recruitment)
were not inhibited (Figure 4). While H3K36 reduction
associates with decreased transcription elongation it
also associates with altered alternative splicing that can
associate with a reduced rate of transcription elongation
[59, 60]. Our results suggest that chromatin configuration
and chromatin modifications impact p53-dependent gene
expression but the mechanisms of this inhibition and the
association with MDM2 overexpression requires further
study.
Regulation of promoter pausing and elongation
are key regulatory events during transcription in
developmental biology [69]. Human embryonic stem
cells have approximately 75% of all genes poised for
transcription initiation with regulation at post-initiation
steps and only a fraction of the genes able to efficiently
elongate [69]. Evidence from Drosophila and some
mammalian cell lines show environmental responsive
genes are poised for transcriptional activation with
paused RNA Pol II near transcription start sites [70,
71]. Deregulation of any number of elongation factors,

treatment with 8AA decreased the cell viability of all
cell lines tested (Figures 6 and 7). Therefore, inhibiting
RNA metabolism using 8AA may be an excellent
treatment option for G/G SNP309 MDM2 overexpressing
cancers. Clinical trials are already being carried out for
8-chloro-adenosine [62, 87] which works via a similar
mechanism. Our study suggests that 8AA should be added
to the arsenal of drugs for cancers with high expression of
MDM2 and compromised p53 pathways.

levels (Figure 2) because some of the MDM2 influenced
was MDM2-C. The fact that MDM2 isoforms display
both p53-dependent and p53-independent transforming
activities further suggests that therapies for cancers with
overexpressed MDM2 should be targeted towards p53independent cell death pathways.
Chemotherapeutic drugs commonly function
through DNA damage pathways which signal to p53 [80,
81], but therapeutics that do not damage the DNA can
be useful in cases where p53 activity is blocked. DNA
damage signals a p53-dependent cascade to induce cell
cycle arrest or cell death [6, 7]. Cancer cells with G/G
SNP309 MDM2 overexpression are resistant to DNA
damaging drugs through an attenuated p53 stress response
and therefore require alternative targeted treatments [29,
40]. Small molecule inhibitors have been developed
targeting the MDM2-p53 binding pocket as a way to
release and activate p53 (see reviews [11, 40, 82]).
Nutlin -3 is one such drug that is reported to have efficacy
at activating the p53 pathway in MDM2 overexpressing
cells with mdm2 genomic amplification [40, 50].
Activation of the p53 pathway via nucleolar stress as
well as DNA damage-independent cancer therapeutics
that do not require a p53 activation paradigm can work
by inhibiting levels of transcription [62, 83]. Actinomycin
D inhibits both Pol I and Pol II transcription [83]. Low
dose actinomycin D causes specific activation of the
p53 pathway via nucleolar stress [51]. The nucleolus is
considered a bull’s-eye for cancer therapy because when
rRNA synthesis slows drastically p53 levels rise [84].
We used ML-1, MANCA and A875 cells to compare
two different modes of interfering with RNA metabolism
through treatment with actinomycin D or 8AA. Our results
with actinomycin D were in keeping with the published
reports that actinomycin D, at low doses, stabilizes p53
in response to ribosomal stress by releasing ribosomal
proteins that bind MDM2 [51, 64], but our data indicated
that this method was not the most effective in eradicating
cancer cells that express wild-type p53. Treatment with
5 nM actinomycin D increased p53 protein levels but
had a varied influence on cell viability (Figures 6 and 7).
Actinomycin D treatment of ML-1, A875 and MANCA
cells increased p53 protein levels but did not robustly
inhibit cell viability. Discovering therapeutics that function
p53-independently is important because such agents
will be useful for cancers regardless of the mechanism
by which the p53-pathway is inhibited. The nucleoside
analogue 8AA has the promise to be a therapeutic that is
excellent for multiple dysfunctional-p53 cancer types [41,
65, 85, 86]. 8AA is able to induce p53-independent cell
death in metastatic breast cancers [41]. Importantly, when
we treated ML-1, MANCA and A875 cells with 8AA, we
observed no changes in p53 protein levels. This indicated
that the DNA damage and stress pathways needed to
activate p53 were not turned on. More significantly the

Cells were cross-linked for 10 min at 37°C with 1%
formaldehyde followed by addition of 0.125 M Glycine
to quench the reaction with 5 min of shaking at room
temperature. Cells were washed four times with cold
1X PBS and centrifuged at 1100 rpm for 7 min at 4°C
for suspension cells and 2000 rpm for 15 min at 4°C for
adherent cells. The cell pellets were resuspended in 1X
RIPA Buffer (with 1/100 dilution phosphatase inhibitor
cocktail 3 (Sigma-Aldrich)) and incubated for 30 minutes
on ice. The samples were sonicated (1min/1min rest at
98% amplitude) on ice to shear DNA into approximately
3500–150 bp fragments followed by centrifugation at
13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C. Immunoprecipitations were
carried out overnight using 400 μg of protein. Protein A/G
Plus Agarose beads (Santa Cruz) (washed in PBS and
blocked with 0.3 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Invitrogen)
for 30 min at 4°C) were added for 2 hrs with rocking at
4°C. Anti-mouse IgM Agarose beads (Sigma) used for
IgM based antibodies (phospho-Serine 5 CTD RNA pol II
(Covance) and mouse IgM Isotype control(SIGMA))
and diluted to 25% bead slurry and blocked with 1mg/ml
BSA and 0.3mg/ml herring sperm DNA. The samples were
centrifuged for 2 min at 3,000 rpm at 4°C and washed
with (1) 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton-X, 20 mM Tris pH 8.1,
150 mM NaCl, (2) same as Wash 1 but NaCl is 500 mM,
(3) 0.25 M LiCl, 1%IGEPAL, 1% Na Deoxycholate, 1 mM
EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH 8, (4) TE pH 8, (5) same as Wash 4;
spinning the beads down between each wash. Elution
buffer (0.1M NaHCO3 in 1% SDS) and 1mg/ml Proteinase
K (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to beads and incubated
overnight at 65°C. 40 μg of cell lysate was used as total
DNA input. The DNA fragments were purified using the
PCR Purification kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s
protocol and amplified by quantitative PCR.

on ice was done. Samples centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for
20 min at 4°C. The supernatants were stored at −80°C.

Chromatin fractionation
Cells were pelleted at 1100 rpm for 7 min at 4°C
and washed three times with 1X ice-cold PBS. Cells were
suspended in Buffer A (10 mM HEPES pH 7.9, 10 mM
KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.34M Sucrose, 10% glycerol,
1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 μg/ml Leupeptin, 8.5 μg/ml
Aprotinin) + 0.1% Triton X-100. Incubated on ice 5 min.
Spun down cells 3600 rpm for 5 min at 4°C.Spun down
supernatant for an additional 5min at 13,000 rpm at
4°C to clarify (S1 Fraction). Washed pellet 2 times with
Buffer A spinning down at 3600 rpm for 5min at 4°C.
Resuspended nuclei pellet in Buffer B (3 mM EDTA,
0.2  mM EGTA, 0.5 mM PMSF, 2 μg/ml Leupeptin,
8.5  μg/ml Aprotinin). Samples were incubated on ice
30 minutes with vigorous vortexing every 5 minutes
and then spun down 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The
supernatant is nuclear soluble proteins (S2 Fraction) and
the pellet is enriched in chromatin. Washed pellet 2 times
with Buffer B. Resuspended pellet (P3 Fraction) in RIPA
buffer and sonicated 3 times 30 sec/30 sec rest on ice.
