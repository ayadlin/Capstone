ABSTRACT:
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults
in the western world. Although promising new therapies for this incurable disease
are being tested in clinical trials, the therapeutic relevance of metabolic rewiring
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is poorly understood. The aim of this study
was to identify targetable metabolic differences in primary CLL lymphocytes by the
use of Dasatinib. Dasatinib is a multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat chronic
myelogenous leukemia (CML) and is being tested in clinical trials for several cancers
including CLL. This drug has been shown to be beneficial to CML patients suffering
from diabetes by reducing their glucose plasma levels. In keeping with this previous
observation, we report that Dasatinib induced glucose use while reducing lactate
production, suggesting that this tyrosine kinase inhibitor decreases aerobic glycolysis
and shifts glucose use in primary CLL lymphocytes. Our results suggest that primary
CLL lymphocytes (independently of traditional prognostic factors) can be stratified in
two subsets by their sensitivity to Dasatinib in vitro. Increased glucose use induced
by Dasatinib or by inhibition of mitochondrial respiration was not sufficient to sustain
survival and ATP levels in CLL samples sensitive to Dasatinib. The two subsets of
primary CLL lymphocytes are characterized as well by a differential dependency on
mitochondrial respiration and the use of anabolic or catabolic processes to cope
with induced metabolic/energetic stress. Differential metabolic reprogramming
between subsets is supported by the contrasting effect on the survival of Dasatinib
treated CLL lymphocytes with pharmacological inhibition of two master metabolic
regulators (mTorc1 and AMPK) as well as induced autophagy. Alternative metabolic
organization between subsets is further supported by the differential basal expression
(freshly purified lymphocytes) of active AMPK, regulators of glucose metabolism and
modulators of AKT signaling. The contrasting metabolic features revealed by our
strategy could be used to metabolically target CLL lymphocyte subsets creating new
therapeutic windows for this disease for mTORC1 or AMPK inhibitors. Indeed, we
report that Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes was selectively cytotoxic to
Dasatinib sensitive samples. Ultimately, we suggest that a similar strategy could
be applied to other cancer types by using Dasatinib and/or relevant tyrosine kinase
inhibitors.

INTRODUCTION

hypothesize that resistance to Dasatinib is associated with
a differential metabolic adaptation to metabolic stress in
primary CLL lymphocytes. We report that the differences
in the resistance to this TKI are associated with a lower
sensitivity to mitochondrial complex I inhibition and
the phosphorylation steady state of a master regulator of
metabolism, the 5’ AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).
Our results demonstrate that Dasatinib-induces energetic
stress in primary CLL lymphocytes in vitro and that
AMPK activation contributes to Dasatinib-drug resistance
in a subset of primary CLL samples independently of
traditional prognostic factors.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most
common adult B cell malignancy in the western world,
is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal
peripheral (mature) CD5+ B cells in the blood and in
primary and secondary lymphoid tissues of affected
patients. A characteristic trait of these malignant
lymphocytes is their low rate of proliferation, estimated to
be a half of the proliferation rate of normal B-lymphocytes
[1]. Prolonged survival of CLL lymphocytes has been
associated with increased ligand-independent signaling
activation downstream of the B-cell receptor. This
has led to the clinical testing of non-receptor tyrosine
kinase inhibitors that target key Src family kinases (i.e.
Dasatinib), BTK family kinase inhibitors (i.e. Ibrutinib)
and PI3K inhibitors (i.e. CAL-101) [2-4]. The activity
of these tyrosine kinase inhibitors has been shown to
be relatively independent of negative prognostic factors
associated with the clinical response to the traditional
therapeutic agents used to treat the disease such as a
nucleoside analogue, fludarabine [5]. Poor outcome or
prognostic factors in CLL are associated to the mutational
status of the IgVH locus, the expression of CD38 and
deletions at the ATM or p53 locus (del11q and del17p
respectively) [6, 7].
It has been suggested that cancer cell metabolism
is adapted to support high rates of proliferation and
growth. These metabolic changes include higher rates of
aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect) and lipid metabolisms
[8-10]. This knowledge has led to the evaluation of the
effect of drugs used to treat metabolic disorders such as
diabetes and obesity in the proliferation and survival of
cancer cells [9, 11]. Preclinical studies in CLL suggest that
interference with lipid metabolism is cytotoxic to these
primary malignant cells in vitro [12-14]. However, the
contribution of glucose metabolisms and, in particular,
of aerobic glycolysis to primary CLL lymphocytes
homeostasis is not known. In contrast to quiescent normal
B lymphocytes [1, 15, 16], a recent metabolomic study
suggests that CLL lymphocytes produce high levels of
glycolytic intermediates and lactate, observations that are
consistent with the Warburg effect [15].
In the past few years, various reports have shown
that tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) including Dasatinib
affect glucose metabolism ameliorating the fasting
glucose level in diabetic and non diabetic individuals
resulting in some cases in a successful treatment of cancer
and diabetes simultaneously [17-20]. We have recently
shown that Dasatinib can induce endoplasmic reticulum
stress (ER stress) in primary CLL lymphocytes in vitro
[21], a process known to induce glucose uptake and
promote mitochondrial respiration [22, 23]. Furthermore,
as shown by others in CML, we reported that inhibition
of Dasatinib-induced autophagy in CLL results in
sensitization to Dasatinib [21, 24]. For all the above, we

RESULTS
We used primary CLL lymphocytes from 30
CLL cases followed at the Jewish General Hospital
Hematology Clinic upon informed consent. Samples
positive for Del17p and Del11q (deficient for p53 and
ATM respectively) were excluded from this study. By their
sensitivity to Dasatinib obtained by MTT essay, 17 of the
samples fall in the sensitive range IC50s (1nM-1000nM)
and 13 of the samples fall in the resistant range (6-52μM)
(Table 1 and FIGURE 1A left panel). We confirmed
Dasatinib IC50’s cytotoxicity by AnnexinV/PI staining and
FSC/SSC analysis. There were no significant associations
between the IgVH mutational status or CD38 expression
and Dasatinib resistance (p>0.05).

Differential
dependency
on
OXPHOS
metabolisms in primary CLL lymphocytes in vitro
We first characterize the bioenergetics’ profile of
the samples and found no differences in basal (vehicletreated) glucose consumption, lactate production or
ATP levels between Dasatinib sensitive and Dasatinib
resistant samples (data not shown). We next assessed
the contribution of OXPHOS and glycolysis to the
bioenergetics’ of the samples as described before by the
use of a non-toxic concentration of Oligomycin (2μM) an
inhibitor of the mitochondrial complex V (ATP synthetase)
[25]. We utilized the increase on lactate production
(i.e. glycolytic capacity) induced by 2µM Oligomycin
with respect to vehicle treated samples to estimate the
contributions of OXPHOS to the bioenergetics of the
samples tested. The results indicate that OXPHOS
contributes to 70% on average to the bioenergetic needs
of the samples tested (Figure 1A right panel, p<0.001)
without differences between Dasatinib sensitive and
resistant samples. We next tested the effect of a non toxic
concentration of another inhibitor of OXPHOS, 200nM
Rotenone which is a specific inhibitor of mitochondrial
complex I [26] and resulted in a significant and similar
increase in lactate production and glucose use as the one
obtained by Oligomycin confirming the bioenergetic

organization of CLL lymphocytes without differences
between subsets. Nevertheless, Rotenone (200nM)
showed a differential effect on ATP levels decreasing
ATP levels by 2.1 fold in Dasatinib sensitive samples
vs. 1.2 fold in Dasatinib resistant samples (p<0.008)
(FIGURE 1B, left panel) [26]. Suggesting that in this
subset of CLL lymphocytes, glycolysis might not be

sufficient to compensate ATP production upon inhibition
of mitochondrial respiration.
We confirm the higher dependency on OXPHOS of
Dasatinib sensitive CLL samples by the use of a higher
concentration of Rotenone. Rotenone, when used at
500nM induced cell death in all samples tested however,
the effect was significant in sensitive samples (p<0.001)

Figure 1: Analyzed samples and their bioenergetics’ organization. A.Left panel: Dasatinib IC50 distribution of 30 CLL patient’s

primary B-cell lymphocytes samples. We distinguished a set of Dasatinib sensitive (<0.1nM-1000nM) and a set of Dasatinib resistant
samples (6-52μM). Right panel: The bioenergetics’ profile of 22 samples of CLL primary lymphocytes cells. To calculate the Glycolysis
(black boxes) and OXPHOS (grey boxes) level in the response to OXPHOS inhibitor, Oligomycin (2uM), we used lactate concentration
ratios in the non treated/treated samples after 24h incubation. In high glucose media, Oligomycin increased significantly lactate production,
2.9 ± 0.5 folds (p=0.011) and OXPHOS contributes to the 70% in average to the bioenergetics need of the samples tested (t-Test p<0.001).
The plotted differences in bioenergetics organization are not ordered following the samples’ Dasatinib sensitivity. B.Left panel: Effect on

(FIGURE 1B right panel). There was however no
significant differences in the fold changes of glucose use or
lactate production between subsets induced by Rotenone
when used either at 200nM or 500nM concentration (data
not shown).
Our results indicate that in spite of comparable
glycolytic capacity (i.e. increased rate of lactate production
after OXPHOS inhibition), induction of glucose use and/
or aerobic glycolysis was not sufficient to maintain ATP
levels and viability in Dasatinib sensitive primary CLL
lymphocytes.

We next assessed the effect of 2-Deoxy-D-glucose
(2-DG), an inhibitor of glucose uptake, on the survival
of primary CLL lymphocytes and found that 30µM1mM range of 2-DG was not toxic to primary CLL
lymphocytes in vitro. In addition, 2-DG induced AMPK
phosphorylation (Thr172) (data not shown) as well as
lactate production in both sensitive and resistant samples,
although with a trend towards a higher increase in resistant
samples suggesting that in primary CLL lymphocytes, as
2553

previously shown in other cell types, decreased glucose
metabolisms can be compensated by glutaminolysis [27]
(FIGURE 1C). Since glutaminolysis unlike glycolysis
requires partial mitochondrial oxidation of glutamine
derived glutamate, we anticipate that limiting glucose
availability will increase the dependency of primary CLL
lymphocytes to OXPHOS metabolism [28]. To test this,
we cultured primary CLL samples in glucose limiting
conditions (2mM). Although glucose consumption was not
different than in regular media (p=0.26), the samples tested
produced lower basal levels of lactate suggesting reduced
glycolytic activity (FIGURE 2A). In this condition,
200nM Rotenone, in contrast to our observations in

regular culture media, induced a comparable decrease in
ATP in all samples tested regardless of their sensitivity to
Dasatinib (FIGURE 2B). These results suggest that under
limiting glucose availability, Dasatinib resistant primary
CLL lymphocytes underwent a metabolic shift towards
OXPHOS.

Dasatinib induces glucose use and decreased
lactate production in primary CLL lymphocytes

(Thr172) and ULK1/2 (Ser317) phosphorylation were significantly higher in resistant samples by 2 and 6.3 fold respectively (t-Test p=0.03
and p<0.001). Western blots analysis revealed similar expression of GLUT-4 in all samples tested and a significant lower expression of
GLUT-1 in sensitive samples (Mann-Whitney U Statistic p=0.005). Resistant samples showed increased basal expression of TIGAR and
was positively associated with Dasatinib resistance (Pearson Corr. r=0.75, p=0.02). PKM2, UCP2, PPARa, mTOR (Ser2448) and Hif-1a

of samples (p<0.001). In contrast, Dasatinib decreased
ATP levels by 4 fold selectively in Dasatinib sensitive
samples (p=0.008) (FIGURE 2C). However, Dasatinib
treatment under limiting glucose availability (2mM)
resulted in a comparable decrease in ATP levels in both
Dasatinib sensitive and resistant samples by more than 2
fold (p<0.008) (FIGURE 2D). Dasatinib-induced glucose
use seemed independent of glucose availability in the
media. In contrast, the reduction on lactate production in
2mM glucose containing media was more irregular than
in complete media (FIGURE 2CD). These results suggests
that 1) Dasatinib in primary CLL lymphocytes induces
energetic stress shifting glucose metabolisms from aerobic
glycolysis and 2) decreased glucose availability and/or
increased OXPHOS metabolisms sensitize primary CLL
lymphocytes to Dasatinib in vitro.

CLL samples suggested that primary CLL lymphocytes
upon ROS induction may have the capacity to increase
proton conductance of mitochondrial inner membrane
[35, 36] while the expression of CPT-1 and PPARa could
indicate a high lipid metabolism capacity in primary CLL
lymphocytes [14].

The LKB/AMPK/ULK axis is constitutively active
in Dasatinib resistant primary CLL lymphocytes:
We found that the expression of LKB1, an activator
of AMPK, was significantly decreased in sensitive
samples (p=0.03) and correlated with Dasatinib in vitro
resistance (IC50 values) (r=0.7, p= 0.03). Statistical
analysis revealed that in basal conditions, defined as
freshly whole blood purified lymphocytes, AMPK
(Thr172) and ULK1/2 (Ser317) phosphorylation (an
AMPK downstream target required for the induction of
autophagy) [30] were significantly higher in resistant
samples when compared to sensitive samples by 2 and
6.3 fold respectively (p=0.03 and p<0.001, respectively).
In addition AMPK (Thr172) and ULK1/2 (Ser317)
basal phosphorylation were significantly correlated to
the response to Dasatinib (r=0.64 p=0.02 and r=0.83
p<0.0001, respectively) (FIGURE 3A). Furthermore, our
results suggests that the differences in basal AMPK and
ULK phosphorylation between subsets are intrinsic to the
samples since there was no change on their expression by
co-culturing primary CLL lymphocytes with stromal cells
(BMS2 cells) previously reported to increase primary CLL
lymphocyte survival by up-regulating survival pathways
and affecting the metabolisms of these leukemic cells [37]
(Supplementary FIGURE 1CD).

Differential expression of metabolic sensors and
transducers in primary CLL lymphocytes
The distinctive responses in both sample sets to
Dasatinib or Rotenone treatments encouraged us to assess
for intrinsic differences in the expression/phosphorylation
status of significant metabolic regulators. In freshly
isolated CLL lymphocytes, we assess the expression of
metabolic sensors such as LKB-1, AMPK, PPARa and
PKM2 [14, 29, 30]; and metabolic transducers for instance
ULK, mTor and Hif-1a [31]. In addition, we examined the
expression levels of glucose transporters (GLUT-1 and
GLUT-4), the mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2)
as well as TIGAR fructose-2-6-bisphosphatase, a promoter
of the pentose phosphate pathway, and CPT-1 (carnitine
palmitoyltransferase-1), a transporter of fatty acid to the
mitochondria.
PKM2, the isoenzyme responsible to catalyze
the generation of pyruvate and ATP through glycolysis
was expressed with no differences between subsets,
suggesting a similar capacity to generate ATP through
glycolysis [32-34]. The hypoxia inducible factor 1a
(Hif-1a) was highly expressed in the samples. Of note,
Hif-1a expression was significantly increased by 2 fold
(range 1.2 to 7 fold, p=0.031) in primary cells cultivated
in conventional culture media (10-12 mM glucose
concentration RPMI1641 media), than the expression
shown by freshly purified lymphocytes from whole
blood samples suggesting higher stabilization if Hif-1a in
conventional culture conditions (Supplementary Figure
1A). Stabilization of Hif-1a in normoxia conditions
(21% oxygen) can be mediated by accumulation of TCA
intermediates such as isocytrate, succinate and fumarate,
three metabolites recently reported to be highly increased
in primary CLL lymphocytes [15, 32-34].
In addition, we found no significant differences in
the expression of UCP2, PPARa and CPT-1 (FIGURE 3A
and Supplementary FIGURE 1B). UCP2 expression in all
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1) and TIGAR
are over-expressed in Dasatinib resistant samples:
Western blot analysis revealed similar expression of
GLUT-4 in all samples tested but with a significant lower
expression of GLUT-1 in sensitive samples (FIGURE
3A). This suggests that there is a differential regulation
of glucose uptake between sensitive and resistant samples
since GLUT-4 and GLUT-1 are distinctively regulated by
PKC and PI3K respectively [38]. Differential capability
for glucose use between subsets is also suggested by
higher TIGAR expression in resistant samples (FIGURE
3A) which was positively associated with Dasatinib
resistance (r=0.75, p=0.02). TIGAR has a fructose-2,6bisphosphate activity and has been shown to decrease
glycolysis by shifting the use of glucose to the pentose
phosphate pathway for NADPH generation and reduction
of ROS [39].

Differential contribution of the mTORC1 and
AMPK checkpoints to the metabolic homeostasis
in primary CLL lymphocytes in vitro under
metabolic stress

In contrast to the differences in AMPK and ULK1/2
phosphorylation, mTor (Ser2448) basal phosphorylation
was detected in all samples tested (FIGURE 3A).
Consistently with constitutive mTORC1 activation,
phosphorylation of P70S6K (Thr389) and 4E-BP1
(Thr37/46) were detectable in almost all of the samples
tested (Supplementary Figure 1E). However, a differential
regulation of the PI3K-AKT axis between sets is suggested
by the down-regulation of the basal expression of a
negative regulator of AKT (PTEN) (three-fold, P<0.001),
and the up-regulation of the positive regulator of AKT
(TCL-1) (three-fold p=0.04) in sensitive samples while
a divergent upstream regulation of the PI3K pathway
between subsets was suggested by the significantly higher
phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1)

We next assessed the effect of Dasatinib on
significant targets twelve hours after Dasatinib treatment
with equally cytotoxic concentrations meaning that each
sample was treated with its own IC50. In this condition, in
vitro treatment with the drug resulted in decreased mTor
phosphorylation (Ser2448) and UCP2 protein levels by 5
fold (p=0.004) and 2 fold (p=0.008), respectively in all
samples tested (FIGURE 3B, left panel). The decreased
levels of UCP2 suggest a drug-induced increase in
mitochondrial membrane potential. This was supported by

(Paired t-Test p=0.029) and more than 3 folds in the case of 4EBP-1 (Paired t-Test p=0.011).

autophagy in the resistance to Dasatinib in both subsets.
In light of our results showing a differential dependency
on OXPHOS between subsets, we also assess the effect of
Metformin. Metformin is a partial mitochondrial complex
I inhibitor used to treat diabetes [11, 40]. Co-treatment of
Dasatinib with specific inhibitors of AMPK, mTORC1
signaling or late autophagy resulted in clearly differential
response between subsets. We found that the combinations
of Dasatinib with 5µM compound C (an AMPK inhibitor)
or Chloroquine (1µM) (an inhibitor of late autophagy)
selectively sensitized resistant samples to Dasatinib by 7
and 2 fold respectively (mean value) (p<0.05) (FIGURE
3C, left panel). In contrast, sensitive samples were
sensitized to Dasatinib by Metformin (1mM) in 5.3 fold
(median value) (p=0.004) (FIGURE 3C, right panel) or
by other inhibitors of mTORC1 signaling pathway. We
used Rapamycin as well as two downstream mTORC1
pathway inhibitors: CGP-57380 a MAP-kinase interacting
kinase-1 (Mnk1, MNK1) inhibitor and a hinder of eIF4E
phosphorylation [41] and the 4EGI-1, a polypeptide that
inhibits cap-dependent protein translation by disruption
of the eIF4E/eIF4G association [42]. The median
sensitization values we obtained for Dasatinib sensitive
samples were of 3.7 for Rapamycin, 4.4 for CGP-57380
and 4.1 fold for 4EGI-1 (p<0.05) (FIGURE 3C, right
panel). Interestingly, the concentrations of CGP-57380
(1µM), 4EGI-1 (10µM) or Metformin (1mM) although not
toxic induced AMPK (Thr172) phosphorylation selectively
in sensitive samples (FIGURE 4A), supporting a higher
dependency of sensitive samples on eIF4E mediated
functions to maintain bioenergetics’ homeostasis. Of note
CGP-57380, 4EGI-1 or Metformin when used alone did
not affect 4EBP-1 phosphorylation, suggesting that the
sensitization effect of the drugs is not mediated by direct
inhibition of mTorc1 (FIGURE 4A).

indirectly through activation of AMPK [11, 43-45]. Indeed,
we found that 5mM Metformin treatment decreased cell
size and induced variable apoptosis selectively in sensitive
samples (FIGURE 4B). Western blot analysis 12 hours
after 5mM Metformin treatment resulted in increased
phosphorylation AMPK (Thr172) while decreasing
phosphorylation mTor (Ser2448) in all samples tested
(Figure 4C). However, inhibition of mTor (Ser2448)
phosphorylation as well as 4EBP-1 was significantly
higher in sensitive samples (two-fold, p=0.029) (FIGURE
4C). Together, Metformin and Rotenone effects on
sensitive samples supported a dependency of sensitive
samples not only on mTor pathway but also on complex I
for their survival.

DISCUSSION
Cancer cells, unlike their normal counterparts,
exhibit significantly different and higher metabolic
requirements; cancer cells consume additional nutrients
due to their high rate proliferation profile thus it is thought
that cancer cells may have to rearrange their metabolic
pathways to compensate their higher need for ATP and
synthesis intermediates. Principally, the Warburg effect
reinstates how cancer cells would supplement their
metabolic requirements [46, 47]. It has been shown
that cancer cells exhibit heterogeneous metabolic
rewiring beyond the Warburg effect suggesting that this
heterogeneity is a manifestation of different metabolic
adaptations by cancer cells. However, in agreement with
Warburg’s initial hypothesis evidence exists that addiction
to glycolysis can be driven by OXPHOS dysfunction.
For examples, in lung and melanoma cells inhibition of
glucose uptake resulted in forced OXPHOS as in this
condition mitochondria were unable to maintain ATP
production [48]. In these tumor cells glycolysis was
shown to be driven by mutated BRAF activity, resulting
to addiction to this oncogene. In addition, the metabolisms
of cancer cells can be driven by tumor associated cells. In
breast cancer for example, glycolysis carried by tumour
associated cells results in the release into the tumor
microenvironment of metabolite that induce OXPHOS
and mitochondrial biogenesis in the adjacent cancer cells
[49, 50].
Regarding CLL primary cells, attempts have
been made to characterize their metabolic organization.
The seminal studies regarding CLL metabolism
suggested that compared to normal lymphocytes, CLL
lymphocytes consumed less glucose in a similar manner
than lymphocytes from patients with diabetes mellitus
[46, 47, 51, 52]. In contrast to these early studies, a
recent metabolomic study using freshly isolated CLL
lymphocytes revealed that these malignant lymphocytes
display high levels of aerobic glycolysis and produce
lactate which are consistent with the use of glucose and
the Warburg effect [53]. In addition we found evidence

that micro-environmental modifications affected the
metabolism of primary CLL lymphocytes by the changes
in Hif-1a expression between freshly purified lymphocytes
and the ones grown in culture media. Hif-1a expression
in primary CLL lymphocytes in normoxia conditions
have been previously reported and was associated with
decreased degradation [32], however stabilization of Hif1a expression has also been shown to be mediated as well
by increased ROS and accumulation of mitochondrial
metabolites [34]. Among Hif-1a functions of promoting
glycolysis, it restricts the mitochondria oxidation of
glucose derived pyruvate [34]. Nevertheless, more studies
should be conducted on CLL metabolic changes between
cultured and freshly isolated lymphocytes to understand
through which mechanism Hif-1a is stabilized since
hydroxylase activity could be inhibited not only by low
concentrations of O2 but as well by high concentrations
of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates (isocitrate,
oxaloacetate, succinate, or fumarate), or chelators of Fe(II)
changes [32-34].
Regarding CLL bioenergetics organization, we
found that in vitro, primary CLL lymphocytes use
significant amounts of glucose and produce lactate.
However, in spite of similar glycolytic capacity, Dasatinib
sensitive samples were more dependent on OXPHOS to
maintain ATP levels than Dasatinib resistant samples.
However, a shift towards OXPHOS metabolism mediated
by the use of limited glucose availability abrogated this
difference. In a similar manner, the more pronounced
decrease on ATP levels induced by Dasatinib in sensitive
samples was abrogated by decreasing the concentration of
glucose in the culture media. Since Dasatinib decreased
lactate production, it is possible that this TKI decreases
glycolysis driven by tonic activation of the B cell receptor,
as shown in lymphoma cell lines [54]. Together, our
results suggest that Dasatinib sensitive samples are more
sensitive to both inhibition of OXPHOS and glycolysis
than Dasatinib resistant samples and that this difference
might be associated with a higher capacity in this later
subset of samples to adapt to energetic stress. Together
with decreased lactate production, Dasatinib increased
glucose use, suggesting that the drug induces energetic
stress as well as a shift in glucose use in primary CLL
lymphocytes. Our results suggest that Dasatinib induces
OXPHOS since increased mitochondrial biogenesis was
observed in both sensitive and resistant samples. The
observed effect of the drug on UCP2 expression levels
suggests an adaptation to increased OXPHOS with
elevated mitochondrial membrane potential. In fact, it
has been reported that the genetic loss of UCP2 leads to a
faster proliferative rate associated with increased glucose
metabolism [35, 36, 55]. In addition, it is possible that
Dasatinib-induced stress increases the use of glucose
through the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). This
pathway generates reduced glutathione (GSH) from
NADPH, a major ROS scavenger, reportedly abundantly
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

present in CLL primary samples [53]. In keeping with the
reported induction of ROS by Dasatinib, up-regulation
of GSH production would be an expected homeostatic
adaptation [56]. Furthermore, Dasatinib has been reported
to disrupt the mitochondrial proton transport complex
[57]. Here, in particular, complex I seemed to be involved
directly in sensitive samples metabolic response and
the higher cytotoxic effect of Dasatinib. Higher glucose
metabolism and glucose dependency in Dasatinib resistant
samples is suggested by the observation that they express
higher levels of the glucose transporter GLUT-1 and by
the immediate effect on Dasatinib and Rotenone resistance
in these samples by the reduction of glucose availability.
In agreement with the higher glucose metabolism in
the Dasatinib resistant samples we found higher levels
of phosphorylation of the IGFR1 target, IRS-1 in this
subset. Thus, Dasatinib resistant samples in contrast to
Dasatinib sensitive samples could sustain glucose flux
through the autocrine activation of the IGFR1 and PKCAMPK [58, 59]. The high expression levels of CPT-1
and PPARa we have observed in CLL indicates, as was
suggested by others, that lipid metabolism is important
for these malignant lymphocytes [14]. Inhibition of
fatty acid metabolism has been shown to be cytotoxic
to primary CLL lymphocytes in vitro and sensitize
them to glucocorticoids. As shown for CLL and AcuteLymphoblastic-Leukemia (ALL), glucocorticoids are
being used as therapeutic agents [60] are known to inhibit
glycolysis and have an effect on GLUT-1 emphasizing the
targeting of glycolytic metabolism as therapeutic strategy
and suggesting that Dasatinib resistant samples might be
more sensitive to glucocorticoids than Dasatinib sensitive
samples [14, 61, 62].
As a result of the present work, further studies
are required to assess the role of fatty acid metabolism
in Dasatinib resistance and the relation with differential
re-wiring of metabolic route. However, higher basal rates
of fatty acid oxidation would be expected in Dasatinib
resistant samples driven by AMPK activation and IGFR1
signaling [63, 64]. In these settings, the decreased levels of
UCP2 induced by Dasatinib treatment might as well reflect
a shift from lipid to carbohydrate metabolisms mirroring
the effects reported by abrogation UCP2 expression, which
results in a shift from carbohydrate to lipid metabolism
[35, 36, 55].
A shift or adjustment of the importance of fatty
acid metabolism in CLL seemed to also happen after
Dasatinib treatment and could be supported by the effect
of ABT-737, a BH3 mimetic compound which targets
BCL-XL, BCL-2, and BCL-W [65]. It has been reported
that CLL resistance to drug treatment is associated to high
expression of Bcl2, a protein directly involved in fatty
acid oxidation (FAO) by its interaction with CPT-1 [66,
67]. The sensitization we found to Dasatinib by ABT-737
suggests that Dasatinib as a metabolic stressor not only
affects glycolysis it may also affect FAO metabolism and

open a therapeutic window where a Bcl2 inhibitor could
be efficient to promote apoptosis in CLL (Supplementary
FIGURE 2).
The differential metabolic organization between sets
can be supported by differences in the induction of other
biological processes by Dasatinib treatments. We have
previously reported that Dasatinib induced endoplasmic
reticulum stress as well as autophagy on wild type p53
samples, furthermore we indicated a synergistic effect of
pifithrin-a, 3-MA or Chloroquine on Dasatinib cytotoxicity
in p53 proficient CLL cells [68]. Here the two established
subpopulations are p53 proficient CLL cells and we found
that endoplasmic reticulum stress as well as ROS were
induced by the drug only in Dasatinib resistant cells
(Supplementary FIGURE 3) though neither the use of
Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2a dephosphorylation and
ER stress-mediated apoptosis, nor NAC, a ROS scavenger,
affected Dasatinib sensitivity (data not shown) suggesting
that these metabolic features, although not associated with
Dasatinib resistance might be a distinctive response to
energetic stress among subsets.
In addition, in sensitive samples (as we previously
reported in p53 deficient CLL lymphocytes) Dasatinib
failed to induce AMPK phosphorylation or autophagy at
lower nM concentrations (IC50s) or clinical achievable
concentrations (180nM) (data not shown). These results,
together with the sensitization effect of Chloroquine
or compound C on Dasatinib sensitivity suggests that
unlike induction ER stress or ROS, autophagy and AMPK
activation contribute to the restoration of metabolic
homeostasis after Dasatinib treatment in the resistant set.
In light of our results, we predict that alternative metabolic
rewiring and response to metabolic stress would be
expected in primary CLL lymphocytes with deficient p53
(del17p) or ATM (del11q) signaling. Since both p53 and
ATM are involved in the regulation of glucose use through
glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway as well as
mitochondrial function [69, 70].
As AMPK activation and autophagy can serve as
protective mechanisms conferring resistance to growth
factor deprivation and maintenance of proliferative
quiescence [71]; we speculate that the differential basal
activation of AMPK and ULK among CLL subsets is
associated with differential dependency of anabolic or
catabolic processes to the maintenance of homeostasis and
survival under energetic/metabolic stress. AMPK has been
shown to repress anabolic processes (i.e. lipid and protein
synthesis) while promoting catabolic processes (i.e. fatty
acid oxidation and autophagy) under energetic stress and
for the maintenance of proliferative quiescence [30, 72,
73]. In this scenario, Dasatinib resistant samples would be
more dependent on catabolic processes driven by AMPK
while sensitive samples would rely on anabolic processes
driven by mTorc1 signaling to maintain homeostasis.

Patient samples
Peripheral blood samples from 30 patients with
a diagnosis of B-CLL attending the clinic at the Jewish
General Hospital were obtained with the patients’ informed
consent in accordance with the ethical approval granted by
the Jewish General Hospital Research Ethics Committee.
A total of 40% (12 of 30) of patients had previously
received treatment. Therapies given were Chlorambucil,
Fludarabine, FC (Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide),
FCR (Fludarabine, Cyclophosphamide, Rituximab),
CHOP (Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine,
and Prednisolone), and Alemtuzumab. Clinical stage at
diagnosis was based on the RAI clinical staging system
(Table 1).

Glucose uptake and Lactate production

of
metabolic
organization
The experiments were performed in two different
culture medias, conventional media used to culture CLL
lymphocytes in vitro and media containing physiological
concentrations of glucose hereafter, high glucose -12mM,
and low glucose-2mM, respectively.
The culture medium, where a million cells were
treated with vehicle or as indicated, was collected after
24 hr and analyzed for glucose and lactate concentrations.
For D-lactate production we used D-Lactate Colorimetric
Assay Kit (BioVision or Sciencell) following the
manufacturer instructions. A colorimetric assay, of
coupling glucose oxidase and horseradish peroxidase
was used to measure glucose consumption in accordance
with Blake and Mc Lean’s protocol [78]. All reagents
were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Briefly, 10uL of each
culture media sample was added to a 500uL reaction
mixture containing 4-aminoantipyrine, N-ethyl-Nsulfopropyl-m-toluidine in a sodium phosphate buffer
to which was added horseradish peroxidase and ddH2O.
Glucose oxidase stock was then added to start the reaction
which was measured 1 hour later for absorbance at 562nm.
Resulting glucose levels were compared to values obtained
for complete RPMI 1640 media conditioned without cells
to determine glucose consumption. The results were
normalized to the number of viable cells in each condition.
To calculate the glycolysis and OXPHOS level in the
response to two OXPHOS inhibitors such as Oligomycin
and Rotenone, we used the previously reported formula
[25]: Lac(c), lactate concentration in the control medium/
non treated samples after 24 hr incubation; Lac(o), lactate
concentration in the medium after 24 hr of incubation with
2uM Oligomycin and 200nM Rotenone. The glycolysis

and OXPHOS % were then calculated as Lac(c)/Lac(o)
*100 and 100-Glycolysis %, respectively.

Aliquots of CLL lymphocytes (3 to 10 × 107cells)
were treated with whole-cell lysis buffer (10 mM TrisHCl, 250 mM sodium chloride, 50 mM sodium fluoride,
0.5% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 10%
glycerol, 1 complete pill of protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche), 1 mM phenylmethysulfonyl fluoride, 100μM
sodium orthovandate, 2mM iodoacetic acid, and 5 mM
ZnCl2). Protein concentration was determined by Thermo
Scientific Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit following
supplier stipulations. Each sample (30μg protein) was
separated on a 4% to 12% Bis-Tris precast acrylamide
gel (BioRad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane
(BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). Western
blots were probed with antibodies against the following
antibodies: from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Bcl2, c-ABL,
Mcl-1, UCP2 (C-20), PPARa (H-98), Glut-1, Glut-4 and
Bip/GRP78 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz,
CA, USA); from Cell Signaling we used Raptor, Rictor,
AMPK (Thr172), ULK1/2(Ser317), TCL1, 4EBP-1,
4EBP-1 (Thr37/46), mTOR, mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K
(Thr 389), eIF4E (Ser209), MNK1 (Thr197/202); from
Novus Syk (Tyr348) (Novus, Cedarlane); TIGAR was
from Abcam and LC3 was from Abgen. Hif1a was from
Cayman Chemical and CPT-1C was from ProteintechTM.
The secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated anti-mouse (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp,
Piscataway, NJ, USA), anti-rabbit (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg,
MD, USA) or anti-goat (Santa Cruz) and detection was
performed by an enhanced chemiluminescence method
(Immobilon Western, Millipore). The signals were
analyzed using ImagesJ 1.44p (Wayne Rasband, NIH) and
normalized to Actin (goat mAB SC-1616, Santa Cruz).

ATP levels measurements
Cellular ATP changes were measured by the
bioluminescence ATP determination Kit reagent according
to the instructions (Molecular ProbesTM). After 24 hrs
treatments the 600,000 cells were collected and counted
by hemocytometer.

Cytotoxicity assay-MTT essay
Lymphocytes were isolated from the peripheral
blood using Ficoll-Hypaque purification as described
previously [79-82]. The CLL-lymphocyte population was
composed of 97.7±2.1% (expressed as the mean %±S.D.)
malignant B lymphocytes. The MTT (3-(4,5-dimethyl-2thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide) assay
was performed 72 hrs after treatment as described in
Amrein et al [21]. 20μl MTT solution at 5mg/ml in 1X
dPBS was added into each well and incubated for 3 hours
at 37°C and 5% CO2. Mitochondrial dehydrogenases of
viable cells reduced the water-soluble MTT to waterinsoluble formazan crystals, which were solubilized with
25 µl Sorensen solution and 100 µl of DMSO. The effect
of Dasatinib (Bristol-Myers Squibb, New Brunswick,
NJ, USA) was described as IC50 (concentration resulting
in 50% of control). The cytotoxicity of other drugs on
Dasatinib was evaluated as the ratio between Dasatinib
IC50 when used alone over Dasatinib IC50 in the presence
of different inhibitors used. Table 2 shows median of these
ratios and concentrations of each drug used.

Apoptosis-PI/annexin V staining
Cells were analyzed for Annexin V binding
(APC- BD) and propidium iodide (PI- Sigma-Aldrich)
incorporation to distinguish between apoptotic and
necrotic cells. Apoptosis was analyzed using the following
manufacturer’s instructions. In brief, the cells were
harvested at 24 and 48 hrs, washed with 1X dPBS, and
incubated for 15 min in 1X binding buffer containing
Annexin V and PI. Before analysis by flow cytometry,
the cell suspension was diluted 1:4 of 1X binding buffer.
We used a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences,
San Jose, CA) equipped with CellQuest software (BD
Biosciences).

One million cells were treated per assay; they were
fixed with 1% formaldehyde followed by permeabilization
in methanol. We employed Cell Signaling anti- AMPKa
(Thr172) (rabbit mAB #2535), anti-ULK1 (Ser 317)
(rabbit mAB#6887) and anti-mTOR (Ser 2448) (rabbit
mAB#2971). The phospho-specific antibodies were
labeled with Alexa Fluor488 goat anti-rabbit (InvitrogenMolecular Probe A11034) used as secondary antibody
and positive cells were visualized with a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) equipped
with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). For CD38
characterization we used Human CD38 APC conjudated
(Invitrogen MHCD3805) and as isotype Mouse IgG1 APC
conjugated (BD Biosciences#340442).

Autophagy induction was monitored by the
detection of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs), which
characterized late autophagy, using the FACScan flow

to detect autophagy. The induction of autophagy was also
assessed by detecting a specific marker of autophagy,
the increase of autophagosomal membrane form of
microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3I-II) at
protein level by Western Blot.

Co-Culture of CLL Lymphocytes
Stromal cells co-cultured effect on B-CLL cell was
assessed briefly as follow, CLL lymphocytes were cocultured with BMS2, a murine bone marrow stromal cell
line (BM-derived, support clone 2, [83] in 1:20 ratio and
different drug and combinations were tested.

Statistical analysis

Drug and compounds

Statistical analysis was performed by parametric
and non-parametric analysis (2-tailed t test, , Pearson
and Spearman Rank correlation analysis and pair-t-test).
All tests were performed using Sigma Stat/Plot software
(Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA, USA). Differences
between groups or associations were considered significant
if p<0.05.

Dasatinib was used alone or in combination. We
assay sensitization on Dasatinib IC50s of CGP 57,380 (1 to
10µM), 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) (300uM), Chloroquine
(5µM), Rapamycin (100nM), and 2-DG (60µM to 1mM)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich; 4EGI-1 (10µM)
was purchased from Santa Cruz. Metformin was assayed
in 1mM to 5mM and was obtained from Sigma Aldrich as
well as Oligomycin (2µM) and the complex I inhibitor,
Rotenone. Rotenone was assayed in 200nM and 500nM
a concentration reported as enough to decrease ATP and
block oxygen respiration [26].
To study the effect of ROS production on Dasatinib
response cells were pretreated with 5mM of the antioxidant N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC, Sigma, Taufkirchen,
Germany) and combined with Dasatinib IC50 for 24 hours.
In addition a BH3 mimetic drug, ABT-737 (Selleck
Chemicals), which target BCL-XL, BCL-2, and BCL-W
was used in 1 nM and was purchased from Cedarlane,
Canada.

CONCLUSIONS
It has been proposed that cancer cells can achieve
metabolic homeostasis by either increasing their metabolic
activity and ensuring metabolic fluxes by the maintenance
of anabolic processes or by reducing their metabolic
demands promoting catabolic processes [10, 74, 75]. It is
possible that CLL lymphocytes use distinctively anabolic
or catabolic strategies. The induction of catabolism and the
increased activation of anti-anabolic processes are mainly
supported in resistant samples which showed an increased
autophagy and ER stress [76] two catabolic processes
increased after Dasatinib treatment only in resistant
samples while sensitive samples primarily seemed to rely
on mTORC1 signaling (Supplementary Figure 3). The
differential basal activation of AMPK and ULK indeed
suggest differential setting of the AMPK/mTor metabolic
checkpoint. Of interest, differences in AMPK activation
reported here were observed in freshly isolated samples
and did not change by co-incubation with stromal cells,
suggesting that this feature is intrinsic to the samples.
The use of Dasatinib reveals this intrinsic differential
metabolic rewiring among CLL lymphocytes. This is
further supported by the reliance on the maintenance
of anabolic (i.e. mTor signaling in sensitive samples)
or catabolic processes (i.e. AMPK and autophagy) in
response to Dasatinib-induced metabolic stress. This
feature could be used to target these two subsets of CLL
lymphocytes using other TKIs. Indeed we find in CLL
samples without cytogenetic aberrations such as del11q
and del17p, that Dasatinib resistance correlated with the

2′-7′-Dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFHDA) is one of the most widely used techniques for
directly measuring the redox state of a cell. The cellpermeant H2DCF-DA enters the cell where intracellular
esterases cleave off the diacetate group. The resulting
H2DCF is retained in the cytoplasm and oxidized to the
highly fluorescent 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) DCF
by ROS which can be measured by flow cytometry. One
