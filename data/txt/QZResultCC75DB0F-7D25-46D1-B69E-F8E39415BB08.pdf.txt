Abstract

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy of the skeleton and is prevalent in children
and adolescents. Survival rates are poor and have remained stagnant due to chemoresistance and
the high propensity to form lung metastases. In this study, we used in vivo transgenic models of cfos oncogene-induced osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma in addition to c-Fos-inducible systems in
vitro to investigate downstream signaling pathways that regulate osteosarcoma growth and
metastasis. Fgfr1 was identified as a novel c-Fos/AP-1 regulated gene. Induction of c-Fos in vitro
in osteoblasts and chondroblasts caused an increase in Fgfr1 RNA and FGFR1 protein expression
levels that resulted in increased and sustained activation of MAPKs, morphological transformation
and increased anchorage-independent growth in response to FGF2 ligand treatment. High levels of
FGFR1 protein and activated pFRS2α signalling were observed in murine and human
osteosarcomas. Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 signalling blocked MAPK activation and
colony growth of osteosarcoma cells in vitro. Orthotopic injection in vivo of FGFR1 silenced
osteosarcoma cells caused a marked 2- to 5-fold decrease in spontaneous lung metastases.
Similarly, inhibition of FGFR signalling in vivo with the small molecule inhibitor AZD4547
markedly reduced the number and size of metastatic nodules. Thus, deregulated FGFR signalling
plays an important role in osteoblast transformation and osteosarcoma formation and regulates the

INTRODUCTION
Osteosarcoma is an aggressive mesenchymal tumor and the most common primary
malignancy of the skeleton, occurring primarily in children and young adults. Despite
advances in combined adjuvant chemotherapy and limb-sparing surgery, the 5-year survival
rate has not improved in the past decade and has reached a plateau of 60-70%1,2. Resistance
to chemotherapy and a high propensity to form lung metastases represent the most
significant indicators associated with overall low survival. The causes of osteosarcoma are
not known, although there is clear predisposition to germline mutations in the pRb and p53
tumor suppressor genes, although these account for only a small subset of tumors3.
Correlations also exist with some somatic mutations, including overexpression of oncogenes
such as c-Met and c-Myc4-6, and in particular in c-Fos which is expressed in a significant
number of osteosarcomas7,8. Genes involved in migration and metastasis, such as ezrin,
podoplanin and S100A49-11 have been implicated, however, the mechanisms of metastasis
are not clear. Understanding the molecular mechanisms that trigger both the onset as well as
its metastatic development are required in order to develop suitable targeted molecular
therapies.

Genetically modified mouse models have been informative in understanding the
pathogenesis of osteosarcoma3. We have previously demonstrated that transgenic mice
overexpressing the c-fos proto-oncogene postnatally develop osteosarcomas with 100%
penetrance12. c-Fos is a member of the AP-1 family of transcription factors, containing cFos (FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2), c-Jun (JunB, JunD) and ATF (ATF-2, ATF-3, ATF-4 and ATFa)
family members13. c-Fos targets cells of the osteoblast lineage for transformation and c-Fosdependent tumor formation can be modified by additional genetic modification of the c-Fos
dimerisation partner, c-Jun14 or the upstream regulatory kinase, Rsk-215. Chondrogenic cells
are also targets for c-Fos-induced transformation as transgene overexpression during
embryogenesis in chimaeric mice transforms chondrogenic cells leading to a high frequency
of chondrosarcomas16. In both models of skeletal neoplasia, the transformation of
osteogenic and chondrogenic cells is unique to c-Fos, as gain- or loss-of-function of any
other AP-1 family member fails to induce bone or cartilage tumors, despite high expression
levels17.
The downstream pathways induced by c-Fos activation and their contribution to
tumorigenesis and metastasis are poorly understood. We have previously demonstrated
overexpression of the cell cycle regulators cyclins D1, E and CDKs 2, 4 and 6 in c-Fos
transgenic osteosarcomas, and specific induction of c-Fos in tetracycline-regulatable
osteoblastic and chondroblastic cell lines affected cell cycle progression and

differentiation18,19. Taking advantage of the c-Fos-inducible osteoblast and chondrocyte cell
lines we have previously screened a number of candidate genes and have identified
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) as a potential target. FGFRs (FGFR1-4) are
members of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family that trigger intracellular signalling
cascades that classically involve the MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways, but also include PLCγ,
Cbl and STAT pathways20,21. FGF/FGFR signalling has a well-established role in the
differentiation and growth control of osteoblasts and chondroblasts22,23, and germline
mutations in FGFRs cause many developmental skeletal disorders such as craniosynostoses
and chondrodysplasias24,25. In this study, we have characterised FGFR1 signalling in the
context of c-Fos oncogene induction in osteoblasts and chondrocytes and have identified a
role for FGF/FGFR signalling in osteosarcoma cell metastasis.

RESULTS
Deregulated c-Fos expression increases FGFR1 levels in osteoblasts and chondrocytes

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

We used the osteoblastic AT9.2 and chondroblastic DT12.4 clonal cell lines which harbor a
tetracycline-regulatable c-fos transgene19,26 to investigate potential c-Fos target genes.
Withdrawal of tetracycline in AT9.2 osteoblasts stimulated the induction of Fgfr1 RNA and
FGFR1 protein that corresponded with c-Fos induction (Figures 1a and b). The correlation
with c-Fos expression was verified by incubation of the osteoblastic parental cell line
MC3T3-E1 with the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), which
resulted in the rapid induction of c-Fos protein within 2h of treatment, and a concomitant
increase in FGFR1 protein (Figure 1c). In addition, overexpression of c-Fos by transient
transfection in primary mouse osteoblasts resulted in increased FGFR1 protein expression
(Figure 1c). A similar induction was observed in the c-fos-inducible DT12.4 chondrocyte
cell line, where Fgfr1 RNA (Figure 1d) and FGFR1 protein (Figure 1e) were upregulated
following tetracycline withdrawal and c-Fos induction. FGFR1 expression in an additional
chondrocyte clone, DT8.6, which constitutively overexpresses c-Fos26, was also increased
compared to wild-type parental ATDC5 cells (Figure 1e). Finally, immunofluorescence
analysis confirmed the c-Fos-dependent increase in FGFR1 protein, which interestingly
showed additional prominent nuclear expression in these cells (Figure 1f). These findings
suggest that Fgfr1 is a potential c-Fos/AP-1 target gene in chondroblastic and osteoblastic
cells. To assess c-Fos binding to the Fgfr1 promoter, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)
analysis was performed which showed increased recruitment of c-Fos to the Fgfr1 promoter
which contains AP-1 sites (Supplementary Figure S1), consistent with Fgfr1 being a direct
c-Fos target.
Increased MAPK activation by FGF in c-Fos-overexpressing cells
We next addressed whether the increase in FGFR1 levels resulted in enhanced
responsiveness of the cells to FGF ligand stimulation. Time course experiments in AT9.2
osteoblasts indicated an increase in p38 phosphorylation in response to FGF2 following cFos induction compared to uninduced cells at 5-60 minutes post-incubation (Figure 2a). No
significant effects on pERK and pJNK were observed in this cell line (Supplementary Figure
S2a). Induction of c-Fos in DT12.4 chondrocytes led to an enhanced pERK
phosophorylation compared to control cells and levels were sustained over a 120-minute

period (Figure 2a). Phosphorylation of p38 was only marginally enhanced in this cell line
and no effects on pJNK were notable (Supplementary Figure S2b). Moreover, dose-response
analyses in AT9.2 and DT12.4 cells showed that increasing doses of FGF2 led to a dosedependent upregulation of pp38 and pERK, respectively, and this was markedly enhanced
following c-Fos induction, particularly at very low doses of FGF2 (Figure 2b). Taken
together, these results suggest that FGF stimulation of osteoblastic and chondroblastic cell
lines leads to an enhanced and sustained MAPK activation in the context of c-Fos
overexpression in a time- and dose-dependent manner, an activity associated with cellular
transformation.
FGF2-induced anchorage-independent colony growth is enhanced by c-Fos induction
To study the functional consequences of FGF treatment, we performed anchorageindependent growth assays in soft agar. Incubation of DT12.4 cells with FGF2 led to an
increase in soft agar colony growth and this was significantly enhanced 2-fold following cFos induction (Figures 3a and b). The c-Fos-dependent increase in colony number was
inhibited by pretreatment with the small molecule FGFR inhibitor, SU5402, as well as with
the MEK inhibitor PD98059, whereas no changes were observed in un-induced cells (Figure
3c). Further, treatment of cells with FGF2 caused a morphological change in adherent cells,
which was enhanced by c-Fos induction (Supplementary Figure S3a). These morphological
changes were prevented by pretreatment with the FGFR inhibitor, SU5402 (Supplementary
Figure S3b). Long term cultures continued to show loss of contact inhibition and formation
of transformed foci in the presence of both c-Fos and FGF2 (Supplementary Figure S3c).
These results suggest that the transforming potential c-Fos in vitro is promoted by the FGF
signalling pathway, and this involves FGFR activation and downstream MAPK signalling.

The functional consequences of altered FGFR1 signalling were next analysed in
osteosarcoma cell lines derived from c-Fos transgenic tumours that constitutively express the
c-fos transgene and form osteosarcomas as xenografts in syngeneic mice12. FGF2 treatment
of three independent cell lines led to an increase in anchorage-independent growth compared
to untreated cells, and the P1.15 cell line in particular showed the most robust response to
FGF2 (Figures 3d and e). Interestingly, cell number was not affected by FGF2 treatment in
monolayer adherent cultures (Figure 3f). Treatment with the FGFR inhibitor SU5402 alone
prevented the number of basal soft agar colonies in c-Fos-transformed osteosarcoma cells, as
well as in human osteosarcoma cells (Figures 3g and h). These data support the notion that
FGFR1 signalling is required for osteosarcoma cell growth, specifically in an anchorageindependent context.
High expression of FGFR1 in vivo in c-Fos-induced murine and human osteosarcoma
We next investigated the expression of FGFR1 and the potential role of activated FGFR
signalling in an in vivo context in c-Fos transgenic osteosarcomas. Immunohistochemical
analysis in early neoplastic lesions that formed shortly after c-Fos transgene expression (eg.
Supplementary Figure 4a) showed high FGFR1 expression that was co-expressed with c-Fos
protein (Figures 4a and b). Strong immunoreactivity for FGFR1 protein was maintained up
to late-stage tumours and this high expression was particularly notable in transformed
osteoblasts lining neoplastic bone, with some osteoblasts showing strong nuclear FGFR1

expression, as well as in the less-differentiated fibrous tumour stroma (Figure 4c;
Supplementary Figures 4b and c). Further immunohistochemical analysis of pFRS2α, a
docking protein that is essential for FGFR signalling showed similarly high levels of
pFRS2α protein in transformed osteoblasts lining neoplastic bone, including some with
apparent nuclear localisation (Figures 4d and e). High expression of the FGF ligands, Fgf2
and Fgf18, were also demonstrated in transformed osteoblasts of late-stage tumours (Figures
4f-h), further suggesting activated FGFR signalling. The timing of FGF ligand/receptor
expression was consistent with the increased proliferative index during osteosarcoma
formation as defined by in vivo BrdU labeling of tumour cells (Supplementary Figures 4d
and e). Finally, a correlation between FGFR1 and c-Fos expression was also observed in cFos chimaeric mouse chondrosarcomas16, with high levels of FGFR1 in differentiated
chondrocytes that also expressed the c-Fos transgene (Supplementary Figures 4f and g).

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To establish whether FGFR1 might be involved in human osteosarcomas we next
investigated FGFR1 protein expression in tumour samples using tissue microarrays (TMAs).
Overall, from a total of 86 samples, a high proportion of tumours showed positive
immunoreactivity for FGFR1 protein, and particularly relevant was the high expression in
transformed osteoblasts within the tumour samples (Figures 5a and b). Semi-quantitative
analysis suggested that 64/86 (74%) of samples demonstrated positive immunoreactivity for
FGFR1 expression, and of those, 53/64 (83%) were classified as expressing moderate to
high levels of FGFR1 (Table 1a). Because of the link existing between FGFR1 and c-Fos in
transgenic mice, we also investigated whether a similar association was evident in human
osteosarcomas. Parallel TMAs were also assessed for c-Fos expression, and consistent with
the observations in mouse transgenic tumours, there was a good correlation between c-Fos
and FGFR1 expression. From a total of 86 tumours, 68/86 (79%) expressed high levels of cFos, and of those, 54/68 (79%) also expressed FGFR1 (Table 1a). Of the tumours expressing
low levels of c-Fos (18/86), 9/18 (50%) also expressed FGFR1 (Table 1a; Figure 5c).
Overall, the highest proportion (~52%) of samples expressed high levels of both c-Fos and
FGFR1, whereas only few tumours (~12%) expressed low levels of both c-Fos and FGFR1
(Table 1b, Figure 5d). Expression of c-Fos and FGFR1 was also frequently noted in
osteoblastic cells (Figure 5b). Taken together, high expression of FGFR1 in osteosarcomas is
detected in early stages of osteosarcoma pathogenesis, and this is maintained throughout
tumour growth with high constitutive expression of FGF ligands and active FGFR/pFRS2α
signalling in the tumours.
Genetic silencing of FGFR signalling inhibits osteosarcoma metastasis in vivo
Osteosarcoma cells have a high propensity for forming lung metastases, and c-Fos
transgenic cells spontaneously metastasise to the lungs upon intratibial injection. We
therefore used a well-established in vivo xenograft model to test whether FGFR1 signalling
can regulate metastatic behavior of c-Fos-transformed osteosarcoma cells. To this end, we
generated two independent lentivirally-transduced shRNA pools (sh1, sh2) targeting
different Fgfr1 sequences in P1.15 cells. Both sh1 and sh2 clones showed significant
decreases in Fgfr1 RNA levels and FGFR1 protein compared to mock-infected control cells
(Figures 6a and b). Growth curve analysis of both silenced clones showed that knockdown
of FGFR1 had no effects on cell number compared control-transduced cells (Figure 6c),

which was similar to pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 (Figure 3f). Orthotopic injection
of mock-infected P1.15 cells into immunocompromised mice resulted in marked lung
metastatic activity 14 days after intratibial injection. However, mice injected with both
FGFR1 shRNA cells showed a decrease in tumour burden in the thoracic cavity as assessed
by bioluminescence imaging, although this did not reach statistical significance (Figures 6d
and e). However, post-mortem and histological analyses revealed a marked decrease in both
the number and the area of metastatic nodules in the lung parenchyma in mice injected with
both FGFR1 knockdown clones (Figure 6e and f). No metastases were found in other organs
upon macroscopic necropsy of all animals (data not shown), and no apparent differences
were observed in tumour volume and osteolysis at the primary tibial injection sites over the
2-week experimental period (Figures 6d and e, and data not shown). These results suggest
that silenced FGFR1 signalling in the context of c-Fos overexpression decreases prometastatic activity in an orthotopic model of osteosarcoma.
Pharmacological inhibition of FGFR signalling osteosarcoma metastasis in vivo

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

To demonstrate further the relevance of genetic knockdown of FGFR signalling, we
inhibited this pathway in vivo using the pharmacological FGFR1 inhibitor, AZD4547. Using
the spontaneous lung osteosarcoma metastasis model, we performed orthotopic injection of
wild-type osteosarcoma cells into immunocompromised mice, followed by systemic
treatment with either AZD4547 or vehicle. Fourteen days post-injection, a marked decrease
in tumour burden was observed in the thoracic cavity as assessed by bioluminescence
imaging, whereas no differences were observed in hind limbs (Figures 7a and b).
Histological examination revealed a marked decrease in both the number of metastatic lung
nodules and the area of metastatic lesions in the lung parenchyma in mice treated with
AZD4547 compared to controls (Figures 7c and d). Interestingly, the degree of lung
metastasis inhibition by systemic treatment of the FGFR inhibitor was similar to the genetic
knockdown of FGFR1 (Figures 6e and f). As before, no metastases were found in other
organs upon macroscopic necropsy of all animals (data not shown), and no apparent
differences were observed in tumour volume and osteolysis at the primary tibial injection
sites over the 2-week experimental period (Figures 7a and b). These data indicate that FGFR
signalling is involved in the prometastatic activity of osteosarcoma cells to the lungs.

DISCUSSION
In this report, we have identified FGFR1 as a novel c-Fos/AP-1-regulated gene and have
characterised the function of FGFR1 signalling in driving osteoblast transformation in
human and murine osteosarcomas, and demonstrate a novel role for FGFR1 in pulmonary
metastasis of osteosarcoma cells.
The role of altered signalling by different FGFRs in sarcomas is poorly understood
compared to carcinomas20,27. Our findings of high FGFR1 protein levels in transgenic
osteosarcomas from the earliest stages of tumour formation in vivo support its relevant role
in its pathogenesis. High FGFR1 expression was paralleled by high pFRS2α expression,
which is essential for downstream FGFR1 signalling. The apparent nuclear localisation of
FGFR1 and pFRS2α is interesting in view of the continuously increasing importance of

nuclear RTK signaling, FGFR1 and FGF ligands, in cancer cell proliferation and migration
as well as in osteoblasts20,28-30. The consequences of activated FGFR/FRS2α signalling are
mediated, at least in part, by MAPKs as increased FGFR1 expression both in c-Fosinducible osteoblasts and chondrocytes, as well as in murine and human osteosarcoma cell
lines, led to enhanced and sustained FGF2-stimulated MAPK signalling and anchorageindependent growth that were blocked by RTK and MEK inhibitors. The relevance of
activated FGFR/FRS2α signaling is further supported by the recent analysis of TCGA
datasets where FRS2 was identified as an oncogenic target potentially druggable31.
FGFs are well-known regulators of cell cycle progression and osteoblast proliferation32 and
our results, as well as supporting the notion that enhanced FGF/FGFR signalling is a bona
fide candidate for driving hyperproliferation of osteoblasts in a pathological setting, identify
a specific role for FGFR1 signalling in anchorage-independent growth and metastasis that go
beyond its role merely as a mitogen. The additional high expression of both FGF2 and
FGF18 that we observed in c-Fos-induced osteosarcomas, in both stromal cells and
osteoblasts, is noteworthy since both these ligands are unique in their ability to expand both
osteoblast and chondrocyte precursor populations24,33. The high levels of both FGFR1 and
FGF ligands suggest that osteoblast hyperproliferation, transformation and tumour
progression might be driven in part by an FGF/FGFR autocrine loop20,34-37. Finally, as in
vivo models have demonstrated that dosage levels of FGF ligands or FGFRs can
differentially mediate their biological effects38,39, our suggestion of a positive autocrine
loop, together with other cooperating pathways40, might surpass a threshold required for
transformation and explain the potent tumorigenic and metastatic effects.

Interestingly, perturbation of FGFR signaling by mutations in FGFRs-2-4 have been found
in a variety of human tumours, however, oncogenic mutations in FGFR1 are extremely rare
and it appears that FGFR1-associated malignancies are rather driven through overexpression
and/or gene amplification20,41. Our findings are consistent with this notion and also support
the recent studies describing FGFR1 amplification in <20% of osteosarcoma patients that
correlates with poor response to chemotherapy, as well in a small number of osteosarcoma
cell lines that revealed sensitivity to an FGFR inhibitor42,43.
This relevance of FGFR1 signalling in vivo is further underscored by both genetic and
pharmacological approaches demonstrating a marked decrease in lung metastases. Of note,
the small molecule inhibitor, AZD4547, exhibits inhibitory activity on all FGFRs but has a
10-fold higher affinity to FGFR1. While there is an established role of FGFR signalling in
cancer cell migration, invasion and metastatic progression41,44, the mechanisms underlying
the role of FGFR in lung metastasis of osteosarcoma cells are not entirely clear. As these
cells are derived from c-Fos overexpressing transgenic osteosarcomas, the high metastatic
activity observed in this model may be explained in part by increased c-Fos/AP-1 activity
which is associated with high expression of prometastatic genes45. In this regard, we have
also previously identified potential candidates involved in murine and human osteosarcoma
metastasis such as S100A4, periostin and podoplanin, some of which are also c-Fos/AP-1dependent targets9,11,46,47. Further functional studies would be required to fully elucidate the
mechanisms of FGFR1 signalling in osteosarcoma metastasis, either alone or in the context
of cross-talk with other c-Fos/AP-1 target genes. It remains, nevertheless, that our findings

have potential clinical relevance since lung metastasis represents the most common
complication in osteosarcoma patients.

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Although the c-Fos transgenic osteosarcoma model was instrumental in identifying the
relevance of FGFR1 signalling to osteosarcomas, the analysis of a large number (89) of
human osteosarcomas demonstrated not only a significant proportion of high FGFR1expressing tumours, but also showed a good correlation between high expression of both
FGFR1 and c-Fos. Thus, given the well-established heterogeneity in human osteosarcomas,
our findings will most likely be representative of a substantial fraction of tumours.
Intriguingly, as FGFR1 signalling also appears to be activated by c-Fos in transgenic
chondrosarcomas, it is tempting to speculate that our findings could potentially be
extrapolated to the subset of human high-grade chondrosarcomas that also express c-Fos and
are characterised by their aggressive behavior with similar metastatic lung tropism and poor
clinical outcome48.
In summary, our study sheds light on the FGF/FGFR1 pathway in deregulating osteoblast
growth during transformation, tumour formation and metastasis. In view of the recent rapid
development of FGFR inhibitors as anti-cancer agents, our work supports the expanding
repertoire of tumour types that might be targetable by FGFR inhibitors, including AZD4547,
that are being used in studies for FGFR1-amplified tumours20,35,49. More importantly, our
novel findings of a prometastatic role for FGFR1 have important potential therapeutic
applications for the use of FGFR inhibitors in osteosarcoma metastasis.

Tissue Microarray Analysis

Europe PMC Funders Author Manuscripts

Tissue microarrays containing a total of 86 cases of human conventional osteosarcoma were
constructed as previously described11 following ethical approval of the University of Tokyo
(No.1220) following informed consent, and combined with commercially available samples
(OS801, US Biomax, Inc., Rockville, MD). Immunohistochemical staining was carried out
using anti-FGFR1 and anti-c-Fos polyclonal antibodies as described above. Only
immunoreactive tumour cells were included in the quantification, and grading of the
immunostaining was scored by estimating the intensity of staining: low expression
representing those scored as no or low immunoreactivity, and high expression representing
those scored as moderate or high immunoreactivity.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of proliferation rates, tumour growth, and differences in metastatic area were
analysed either by ANOVA followed by Tukey’s Post hoc test or by Brown-Forsythe and
Tamhane’s T2 test. Data are presented as mean ± SD from a minimum of three independent
experiments. All in vitro studies were assumed a normal distribution. For non-parametric
statistics, data were analysed by Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Mann-Whitney multiple
comparison test with Bonferroni’s adjustment. Tissue Microarray Array data were analysed
using Fisher’s exact test. Student’s t-test was used where indicated.
