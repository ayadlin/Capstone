ABSTRACT
Vav family members function as remarkable scaffold proteins that exhibit both
GDP/GTP exchange activity for Rho/Rac GTPases and numerous protein-protein
interactions via three adaptor Src-homology domains. The exchange activity is
under the unique regulation by phosphorylation of tyrosine residues hidden by
intra-molecular interactions. Deletion of the autoinhibitory N-terminal region results
in an oncogenic protein, onco-Vav, leading to a potent activation of Rac GTPases
whereas the proto-oncogene barely leads to transformation. Substitution of conserved
residues of the SH2-SH3 adaptor region in onco-Vav reverses oncogenicity. While
a unique substitution D797N did not affect transformation induced by onco-Vav,
we demonstrate that this single substitution leads to transformation in the Vav1
proto-oncogene highlighting the pivotal role of the adaptor region. Moreover, we
identified the cell junction protein β-catenin as a new Vav1 interacting partner. We
show that the oncogenicity of activated Vav1 proto-oncogene is associated with a
non-degradative phosphorylation of β-catenin at residues important for its functions
and its redistribution along the cell membrane in fibroblasts. In addition, a similar
interaction is evidenced in epithelial lung cancer cells expressing ectopically Vav1.
In these cells, Vav1 is also involved in the modulation of β-catenin phosphorylation.
Altogether, our data highlight that only a single mutation in the proto-oncogene Vav1
enhances tumorigenicity.

INTRODUCTION

signalling effectors and share high structural similarities
and properties with Vav1. Unlike Vav1, Vav2 and Vav3
have an ubiquitous expression [3, 4]. Vav proteins display
a number of characteristic structural domains with
homology for: Calponin (CH), Dbl (DH), Pleckstrin (PH)
and Src (SH2 and SH3) altogether with acidic residuesrich (AcR) and cysteine-rich (CR) motives. These
domains mediate interactions with membrane receptors,

The Vav1 proto-oncogene has a restricted
hematopoietic expression and exhibits both GTP/GDP
exchange activities (GEF) for Rho family GTPases and
adaptor functions within signalling complexes [1, 2]. Two
other genes, Vav2 and Vav3 belong to the same family of

signalling intermediates, cytoskeleton related proteins
and nuclear factors [5]. Vav proteins also exhibit a unique
regulation of the GEF activity through receptor-mediated
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues (pY) present in the
AcR domain [6].
The initial characterization of Vav1 consisted in a
truncated version of the proto-oncogene (wt-Vav1) with
deletion of the first 66 residues within the CH domain
that resulted in a transforming protein (onco-Vav) when
expressed in fibroblasts [7]. Further deletion including
the AcR motive (1-186 amino acids) or substitution of
phenylalanine for the regulatory tyrosines abrogated the
phosphorylation dependency of the transforming activity
[8, 9]. To date, these oncogenic forms of Vav1 have never
been found in neoplasms. Nevertheless, ectopic expression
of Vav1 is detected and involved in the pathophysiology
of neuroblastoma, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, melanoma,
lung and breast cancer [10-14]. In pancreatic tumours,
Vav1 regulates cell-cycle progression, proliferation,
transformation and invasive migration through its
interaction with dynamin 2 [10, 15]. Vav1 is also
expressed in a majority of breast carcinoma where its
activity is dependent on the p53 status of the cells since
it induces apoptosis in wild-type p53 cells but contributes
to proliferation in p53-/- cells [14]. Moreover, mutation
within the N-terminal regulatory region correlates with
central nervous system immune-mediated disease [16].
Critical roles have also been attributed to Vav2 and Vav3
in breast or skin cancers and in metastatic dissemination
[17-19]. Altogether, these data indicate that Vav proteins
display a pivotal role in tumorigenesis although not fully
characterized.
The structural complexity and high similarities of
Vav proteins have indicated both GTPase-dependent and
GTPase-independent roles. Truncations of the inhibitory
CH or AcR domains resulted in deregulated GEF activity,
constitutive activation of Rho proteins and transformation
[8, 20]. However, protein-protein interactions mediated by
specific structural domains of Vav might also contribute
to cellular transformation. In particular, the CR motif
contributes to the stabilization of the DH domain and
to an efficient GEF activity [21]. Intact SH2 and SH3
domains are also critical for the transforming potential
of onco-Vav; mutations of conserved residues within the
SH2 domain of onco-Vav affect or abrogate oncogenicity
due to the loss of association with tyrosine-phosphorylated
proteins [22]. Similarly, mutations of conserved residues
of the C-terminal SH3 domain reversed the transforming
potential of onco-Vav; while mutation of a Vav-family
specific residue in the carboxyl-terminal SH3 domain
(D797) was unsignificant to onco-Vav oncogenicity and
maintained the binding capacity to several interacting
partners [23]. This region also contributes strongly to
the intramolecular inhibition of Vav family proteins
[24]. Moreover, not only Vav2 and 3 but also Vav1
phosphorylation can promote Rho family activation
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in non-hematopoietic tissues following stimulation of
several growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases [25-27].
These Vav-mediated mechanisms lead to reorganization
of actin cytoskeleton and cell-cell contacts and increased
motility [12, 28]. Notably, Vav2-mediated modulation of
p120 catenin - E-cadherin clustering has been implicated
in fibroblasts motility and in Rac-dependent activation of
β catenin [29-31]. Therefore, ectopic expression of Vav1
and its capacity to interact with specific proteins in nonhematopoietic cells contribute likely to its transforming
potential and to tumorigenesis.
In this study, we investigated whether alterations
within the protein-protein interaction CSH3 domain might
activate the transforming properties of the Vav1 protooncogene. We identified D797 as one novel key residue
controlling Vav1 oncogenicity, since its unique mutation
confers transforming properties to Vav1 proto-oncogene.
We also identified β-catenin as a new Vav1 interacting
partner in fibroblasts and epithelial lung cancer cells. The
transformation, which is dependent on Rac activation, is
associated with the phosphorylation and the stabilization
of β-catenin altogether with its relocation from junctional
complexes to random membrane localization in fibroblasts.
Our data provide novel insights on the mechanism of
Vav1-regulated oncogenesis that involves cell-cell contact
dysregulation.

RESULTS
Mutation of the specific aspartic acid 797 residue
in Vav1 C-SH3 domain activates its transforming
and tumorigenic potential
The C-terminal SH3 adaptor region of Vav1 contains
several conserved residues present in Src, Grb2 or Abl
SH3 domains but also unique residues specific for Vav
family members (Figure 1a). We analysed a selection of
Vav1 proto-oncogene CSH3 mutants: D797N, A789N and
G830V, for their capacity to induce foci of transformed
cells when expressed in NIH3T3 cells and compared them
to onco-Vav (∆1-66). Interestingly, mutation of D797
residue activates significant transformation potential,
inducing foci similar albeit to a lesser extent than ∆1-66
onco-Vav. Despite equivalent transfection efficiencies,
as verified by the comparable amounts of G418-resistant
clones obtained with the various constructs, none of the
other mutants as well as wt-Vav1 induced transformed foci
(Figure 1b, c and d). Immunoblot analysis confirmed that
the transforming potential of the D797N mutant could not
be ascribed to higher levels of protein expression. Two
days after transfection or in established stable cell lines,
D797N mutant and wt-Vav1 showed similar levels of
expression and higher levels than onco-Vav that displayed
the greatest transforming capacity (Figure 1e and f).

Kinetic analysis of the mutated proteins in the presence of
cycloheximide validated the steady state levels observed
in stable cell lines showing a weaker stability for A789N
or G830V when compared to D797N, onco-Vav or wtVav1 (Figure 1f and supplemental Figure S1). Moreover,
we noticed higher levels of phosphorylated D797N and
onco-Vav1 proteins compared to wt-Vav1 reflecting an
increased activation of both mutants in these cell lines
(Figure 1g).
Next, we compared the proliferative properties of
stable cell lines expressing wt-Vav1, onco-Vav or D797N
mutant. Higher proliferation rates and saturating densities

were observed for transforming proteins-expressing cells
while wt-Vav1-expressing cells exhibited an intermediate
growth rate as compared to control with empty vector
(Figure S2a). Unlike control or wt-Vav1, cells expressing
onco-Vav and D797N overgrew the monolayer and
proliferated beyond confluence (Figure S2a). Moreover,
in reduced serum conditions, although wt-Vav1 or control
cells showed poor proliferation rates, cells expressing
onco-Vav and D797N lost high serum dependence
(Figure S2b). Finally, loss of anchorage requirement was
observed for onco-Vav or D797N expressing cells that
displayed clonal expansion developed in semi-solid agar

cultures (Figure 2a). In contrast, wt-Vav1 expressing cells
engendered very few clones of reduced size. D797Ntransformed fibroblasts also acquired the capacity to
generate tumours in Nu/Nu mice after subcutaneous
injection as did onco-Vav and all animals injected with
these cells developed tumours. The overall weight of the
tumours generated by onco-Vav and D797N-expressing
cells was highly above those generated by wt-Vav1
or empty vector when present (Figure 2b). However,
D797N-derived tumours showed a more heterogeneous

size than did onco-Vav while wt-Vav1 expressing cells
only generated small nodes (Figure 2c). Interestingly,
Vav1 proteins extracted from the tumour cells exhibited
activated pY174 at levels comparable to those observed
in injected cells reflecting Vav1 activation (Figure 2c and
1g).
Altogether these data demonstrate that one unique
CSH3 specific substitution into Vav1 proto-oncogene
confers activation to the protein leading to transformation
and tumorigenesis.

Rac1 and RhoA GTPases-dependent pathways
are required for D797N-induced transformation

the dominant-negative form of Rac1, RacN17, strongly
repressed foci formation for both constructs. Comparable
repression was obtained using the dominant-negative form
of RhoA, RhoN19, albeit to a lesser extent that might be
attributed to a weaker expression of the GTPase (Figure
3c).
To explore downstream events mediating the
transforming activity, we investigated the activation of
c-jun NH2-terminal (JNK) and of stress-activated protein
p38 (SAPK) kinases, two direct effectors of Vav and Rac/
Rho GTPases [32]. Immunoblot assay, using a specific
antibody for phosphorylated Thr183/ Tyr 185 JNK1/2,
demonstrated an enhanced activation upon expression
of onco-Vav or D797N as compared to wt-Vav1 or
control vector (Figure 4a). A weaker activation of p38
SAPK was also detected in the transformed fibroblasts
(Figure S3a). Activation of JNK kinases yielded to the
phosphorylation of c-Jun, an important target involved in
cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [34]. As demonstrated
by immunoblotting with anti-phospho-Ser63 c-Jun,
after incubation or not with the SP600125 specific JNK
inhibitor, a strong JNK-dependent activation of c-Jun was
found in onco-Vav- and D797N-expressing cells, while a
weaker activation was noticed for wt-Vav1 (Figure 4b).
Implication of JNK kinases in onco-Vav- and

The transforming activity of all N-terminal deleted
Vav oncoproteins has been ascribed to uncontrolled
GEF activity on GTPases of the Rho family [6, 9,
20, 32]. Therefore, we investigated whether D797Ninduced transformation might similarly depend on Rho
GTPases activation. Cell morphology and cytoskeleton
organization of onco-Vav- or D797N-transformed
cells suggested activation of the GTPases with typical
formation of ruffles (lamellipodia and filipodia) (Figure
3a; [33]). These cells also exhibited a large reduction of
stress fibers that were abundantly present in control or
wt-Vav1-expressing fibroblasts (Figure 3a, Pseudocolor
and quantification of stress fibers and/or ruffles). Using
pull-down experiments with a glutathione S-transferase
(GST) fusion protein containing the Rac1 binding domain
of p21protein-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK), we
observed a significant activation of Rac1 GTPase in oncoVav and D797N-expressing cells and a faint activation in
wt-Vav1-expressing cells. These results also confirmed
the differential transforming potential of onco-Vav and
D797N (Figure 3b). Additionally, overexpression of

β-catenin is a molecular target of Vav1/JNK
activation and a new Vav1 interacting partner

D797N-mediated transformation was further confirmed
using the SP600125 specific inhibitor. As shown in Figure
4c, addition of 10µM SP600125 completely prevented foci
formation by both onco-Vav- and D797N-expressing cells.
In contrast, addition of 15µM SB203580, a p38 SAPK
inhibitor, only reduced by two fold the number of foci
(Figure S3b).
Altogether these results indicate that, similarly to
onco-Vav-, D797N-mediated transformation involves the
GEF activity toward Rac/Rho GTPases leading to typical
cell morphology changes and to the subsequent activation,
albeit to a lesser extent, of JNK-dependent pathways.

Next, we analysed downstream targets of the Rac/
JNK-mediated pathway that has proven relevant for
cell-cell contacts and adherens junctions. Both Rac1 and
JNK2 are involved in the dynamic regulation between
the signalling activity and the structural function of
the stable pools of β-catenin [31, 35-37]. Immunoblot
analysis with antibodies recognizing either β-catenin or
its triple phosphorylated form (Ser33/37/Thr41) showed

higher phosphorylation in cells expressing tranformants
or wt-Vav1 as compared to empty vector (Figure 5a).
Phosphorylation was not associated with an overall
reduction of β-catenin levels as reported for GSK3mediated phosphorylation [38, 39]. In the presence
of the JNK inhibitor, β-catenin phosphorylation was
largely inhibited indicating the involvement of this
kinase in a post-translational modification that does not
trigger β-catenin for degradation (Figure 5a, 40). Thus,
we explored a possible interaction between Vav1 and
β-catenin. As shown in Figure 5b, β-catenin specifically
co-precipitated with all Vav1 proteins. Using GST-fusion
proteins containing either all three (GST-SH) or individual
(NSH3, SH2 and CSH3) Src homology domains, we
further restricted the interaction with β-catenin to the SH2
domain of Vav1. No interaction was observed with the
two GST-SH3 fusion proteins. Interestingly, the D797N
mutation introduced into the GST-SH fusion protein
(GST-SH*) did not affect Vav1 interaction with β-catenin
(Figure 5c). Therefore, these results indicate that Vav1
associates with β-catenin in a complex through its SH2
domain.

cell membrane. As expected, endogenous β-catenin was
abundantly localized at the cell membrane in control cells
with a clustered accumulation at the sites of adhesion
and cell-cell contacts. Importantly, expression of Vav1
proteins resulted in a redistribution of β-catenin all along
the membrane with a decreased clustering. This peculiar
reduction of the clustering of β-catenin was even more
pronounced with the two oncogenic Vav1 proteins. Also,
we noticed in several cells a significant cytoplasmic
accumulation in association with perinuclear labelling
(Figure 6c). These results were confirmed by cellular
fractionation followed by western blot analysis. The
accumulation of pS33/37/T41-β-catenin was detected in
the cytoplasmic fraction with few nuclear translocation
in onco-Vav-expressing cells only; while the non-

Vav1 influences β-catenin phosphorylation and
subcellular localization
Since subcellular localization and phosphorylation
on particular residues of β-catenin are crucial events that
modulate its different functions, we further investigated
whether Vav1 proteins could have an impact on these
modifications. Western blot analysis with anti pS675
β-catenin, a residue phosphorylated by the JNK kinase
[29, 40] confirmed increased phosphorylation in Vav1
expressing cells, and more significantly with the two
oncogenic forms. Similar increases of pY654- and non
phosphorylated- β-catenin were also observed for all
Vav1 expressing cells (Figure 6a). A non specific increase
of all phosphorylated forms in these cells was ruled out
by using anti pY142-, pS552 and pY489- β-catenin that
remained with constant levels in all the transfectants (data
not shown).
Since phosphorylation of S675 and the nonphosphorylated β-catenin have been implicated in
the balance between membrane function and nuclear
translocation of β-catenin, we sought to verify whether
expression of Vav1 mutants could impact β-catenin
transcriptional activity. Upon transient transfection of a
luciferase reporter construct based on β-catenin-TCF/LEF
transcriptional function we did not observe significant
differences between the various Vav1 constructs in 293T
cells. On the other hand, treatment with LiCl, a potent
inhibitor of GSK3β−dependent degradation of β-catenin
resulted in a substantial and comparable induction of the
transcriptional response in all cases (Figure 6b).
Next, we evaluated β-catenin distribution at the

phosphorylated counterpart was consistently distributed
between membrane and nucleus for all the cells (Figure
6d). Furthermore, accumulations of pY654-β-catenin at the
membrane and of pS675-β-catenin both at the membrane
and in the nucleus confirmed the difference seen between
the different cell lines in whole cell extract. Conversely,
random localization of β-catenin at the membrane in
onco-Vav and D797N-expressing cells (Figure 6c) was
not associated with changes in the overall amounts of

β-catenin in these fractions compared to control cells.
Finally, substantial amounts of Vav1 proteins were also
observed in the nuclear fraction (Figure 6d).
Thus, these results support an impact of Vav1
expression on certain phosphorylations and on structural
function of β-catenin at the cell-cell contacts and adhesive
complexes. Notably, a differential phosphorylation by
wt-Vav1, and more importantly by the two oncogenic
proteins, was observed on residues that are targets of

lines (Figure 8d).
These results demonstrate that the expression of
Vav1 contributes in cancer cells to the phosphorylation at
specific residues of β-catenin with an advantage for the
D797N mutant that demonstrated in fibroblasts higher
GEF activity. These modifications of β-catenin participate
to the modulation of its function at cell-cell junctions and
to the subsequent alteration of cell shape and growth.
Moreover, Vav1 interacts also with β-catenin partners in
adherens junctions strongly suggesting a key role in cellcell adhesion.

Ectopic expression of Vav1 allows the modulation
of β-catenin in lung cancer cells
The ectopic expression of Vav1 is observed in
numerous non-hematopoietic cancer cells [10, 12, 13,
41]. As shown in Figure 7a, H358 and H441, two human
lung carcinoma epithelial cell lines exhibit substantial
amounts of Vav1 proteins compared to a lymphoid cell
line (Raji). Our results obtained in fibroblasts prompted us
to figure out whether Vav1 interacts with β-catenin in these
cells. We confirmed the interaction between endogenous
Vav1 and β-catenin in both cell lines. Analyses of Vav1
immunoprecipitates allowed also the specific detection
of α-catenin and E-cadherin, two β-catenin well known
partners at the cadherin-based adherens junctions (Figure
7b, [40]. Remarkably, the two epithelial cell lines
displayed pS33/37/T41β-catenin (Figure 7c). In order to
confirm the impact of Vav1 expression on the stability
and phosphorylation of β-catenin in these cells, we used
RNA interference to reduce endogenous Vav1 expression
or alternatively overexpression of wt-Vav1 or D797N.
Transfection of Vav1 siRNA into H358 and H441 cells
resulted in decreased levels of pS33/37/T41β-catenin
as compared to control siRNA while no reduction of
the overall β-catenin levels was observed (Figure 7c).
This effect of Vav1 was further confirmed with stable
overexpression of wt-Vav1 or D797N in H358 cells
where higher levels of phosphorylation were detected in
such conditions (Figure 8a). Moreover, we confirmed a
differential impact of D797N compared to wt-Vav1 on
pS33/37/T41-, pS675- and pY654-β-catenin intensities
yet the mutant form was expressed at lower levels than
wt-Vav1.
Next, the impact of these overexpressions on the
proliferation rate and the cell morphology were evaluated.
As shown in Figure 8b (left panel) H358 cells expressing
D797N mutant exhibited a rapid overgrowth as compared
to wt-Vav1 or control vector. Similarly, when transiently
transfected with D797N mutant, A549 cells that do not
express endogenous Vav1 (Figure 7a), showed as early
as 72 hrs post transfection a proliferative advantage
as compared to control cells (Figure 8b right panel).
Morphological changes were also observed. While H358
cells expressing wt-Vav1 presented with an intermediate
shape, showing less protrusions and stretched morphology
than vector-transfected cells, D797N appeared with round
shaped cells forming multi-layers groups of cells. Finally,
immunofluorescence analysis of H358 with anti-pS675
β-catenin Ab indicated a more random localization at
the membrane of the phosphorylated protein in wt-Vav1
or D797N cells compared to control cells that kept a
punctuated labeling at sites of cell-cell contact, whereas
total β-catenin remained unchanged between the three cell

DISCUSSION
This study highlights the essential role of
the adaptor region of Vav1 not only as a scaffold
domain for immune receptors signalosomes but also
as a tranformation potentiator. Using, in Vav1 protooncogene, the unique mutation of an aspartic acid
residue, specific for the Vav family of proteins, we show
that alteration of the C-terminal SH3 domain activates
the transforming capacity of the proto-oncogene. A
previous study, addressing the role of the CSH3 domain
in the transforming capacity of onco-Vav, showed that the
D797N substitution did not abrogate the oncogenicity and
was considered as unsignificant compared to mutations on
conserved residues among SH3 domains [23]. Importantly,
our results show that this single mutation, in the fulllength Vav1 proto-oncogene, is able to induce activation
and consequently oncogenesis.
This gain of function mutation occurs on a charged
residue that does not belong to the consensus residues
required for the structural integrity of the SH3 domains
[23, 42]. It is rather placed in a hinge section available
for interaction with negatively charged residues of other
domains or proteins. A previous study already showed
that the mutation on this residue is not likely to affect
the interaction with other partners [23]. We show here
that the novel interaction with β-catenin is conserved
with the mutant protein. Crystallographic resolution of
the full-length molecule has not been reported so far;
however, several mutational or biochemical approaches
have given insights to the regulation of Vav functions
through conformational changes occurring notably upon
a stimulation process [9, 21, 24]. Alterations activating
the transforming activity have been described for other
SH-containing proteins and have been reported in human
cancers. For example, mutations of the kinases Src and
Abl or of the exchange factor Dbl in domains adjacent
to their catalytic site greatly activate their oncogenic
potential [43-45]. So far, oncogenicity of Vav1 has been
ascribed to an activation of its GEF activity following
the deletion of the autoinhibitory loop present at the
N-terminus of the protein [6, 21, 46, 47]. This deletion
allows further regulation of the GEF activity by
phosphorylation of tyrosine residues present within the
2533

Oncotarget

acidic region [48]. These tyrosine residues are hidden
by intra-molecular interactions that prevent the GEF
activity [47-49]. Additional intramolecular folding was
shown to be important for Vav functions [50]. Recently,
an elegant mutational study demonstrated that the
C-SH3 domain highly contributes to the formation of the
autoinhibited state of the full length Vav1 proto-oncogene
[24]. Among others, the D797 residue is mediating such
regulatory intramolecular interactions and consequently,
the D/N mutation should disrupt such a contact leading to
potentiation of the GEF activity as seen in the Rac GTPase
assay. This increased GEF activity is also evidenced by
enhanced phosphorylated state of the D797N mutant
compared to the wt-Vav1.
One key finding of this work is the identification
of a new partner for Vav1, β-catenin. The SH2-domain
of Vav1 mediates this interaction likely by recognition of
phosphorylated tyrosine residues of β-catenin. Multiple
phosphorylated Ser/Thr or Tyr residues of β-catenin are
involved in the regulation of the protein. In particular,
several sequence motives contribute to conformational
changes that lead to signalling functions or recognition
by the proteasomal machinery for its degradation [40].
Our results show that Vav1 expression activates the Rac/
JNK pathway in fibroblasts and, its oncogenic mutations
potentiate this activity. Activation of JNK induces
phosphorylation and stabilization of β-catenin at sites
also targeted by GSK-3β, an important component of the
degradation complex together with Axin and APC [29,
40, 51]. In this work we show that Vav1/JNK-dependent
phosphorylation on both S675 and S33/37/T41 rather
stabilizes β-catenin and its phosphorylated forms in
different cellular compartments. Similar effects of JNK
have been described in keratinocytes and in colon cancer
cells together with an inhibitory role on the formation
of clustered adhesive complexes with α-catenin and
E-cadherin [29, 36, 37]. Expression of the oncogenic
mutants in fibroblasts leads to redistribution of β-catenin
along the membrane with a reduction of adhesion clusters
and some translocation to the cytosol. These results
suggest that Vav1 and its oncogenic forms can serve
as adaptors and potentiators bridging JNK kinase with
effector β-catenin that will modify cohesion at the cell-cell
adhesion sites. We showed an association of Vav1 within
the adherens junction complexes involving α-catenin and
E-cadherin in epithelial cancer cell lines. In these cells we
also evidence a potentiator role for Vav1, and moreover
for the activated D797N mutant, in the phosphorylation of
β-catenin at specific residues and some redistribution of
β-catenin at the membrane along with modification of the
cell shape. Interestingly, a recent work highlighted a role
for Vav1 in Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT)
in ovarian cancer [52] and it has been demonstrated that
β-catenin might participate in this process [53]. Further
work will figure out how Vav1 might contribute to the
modulation of the assembly of adherens junctions. Besides
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Vav1, Vav2, a more ubiquitously expressed member of
the family of adaptors, also interacts with components of
the adhesion complex, e.g. through p120-catenin in SW480 colon cancer cells [54]. Particularly, Vav2 interacts
with Ser-phosphorylated, Tyr-dephosphorylated cytosolic
p120-catenin that has been released from the E-cadherinWnt receptor complex at the cell membrane upon Wnt
stimulation [30].
In
other
cellular
processes,
such
as
osteoblastogenesis, or in colon cancer cells, a Rac1/JNK2dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin was described at
sites that regulate its nuclear accumulation and signalling
function [31]. The transport of β-catenin to the nucleus
represents an important regulation node for the balance
between its adhesive and signalling properties [55]. Our
biochemical fractionation and immunofluorescence
analysis in fibroblasts showed an increased perinuclear
β-catenin labelling in the presence of the transforming
forms of Vav1 but a rather weak translocation to the
nucleus for the pS33/37/T41 stabilized form and a more
evident nuclear accumulation for pS675 β-catenin. In our
experimental settings, in the presence of Vav1 oncogenic
forms, we observed a Vav1-JNK dependent activation of
c-Jun but we did not observe the transcriptional activation
of β-catenin associated with its stabilization. However,
we observed that the D797N mutant confers a growth
advantage when overexpressed in lung cancer cells. We
cannot rule out a putative Vav1-dependent cooperation
between AP1 and β-catenin to regulate tumour progression
and further work is needed to address this point [56, 57].
In light with the recent findings on Vav1 as a
central regulator of invadopodia [15], our study reveals
a new aspect of Vav1 functions when its deregulated
expression favors the interaction with additional partners
that leads to the alteration of signalling pathways involved
in developmental processes or cell contact inhibition
and that can ultimately result in growth advantage or
tumorigenesis. Additionally, our results strengthen
the importance of activating single point mutations in
the C-SH3 domain that abrogate Vav1 autoinhibition,
potentiate the GEF activity and consequently facilitate
tumour progression. Since mutation on the adaptor protein
can affect cell-contact inhibition, Vav seems an interesting
target to modulate signalling during tumorigenesis.
