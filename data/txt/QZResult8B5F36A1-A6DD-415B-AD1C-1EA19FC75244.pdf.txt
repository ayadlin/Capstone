ABSTRACT
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) have shown remarkable benefits in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients with drug-sensitive mutations in the EGFR gene. Responsive patients are
usually continuously prescribed with TKIs until disease progression. Glucocorticoids
(GCs) are potent homeostasis maintaining drugs and are frequently used in cancer
patients to alleviate discomforts caused by anti-cancer therapies. Several previous
studies reported that concomitant use of GCs may compromise the efficacy of
chemo-therapeutics in patients with solid tumors. Little is known in the concomitant
use of target therapy with GCs in treating NSCLC. In this study, we hypothesized that
concomitant use of GCs in EGFR-TKI therapy may be detrimental and addressed this
issue using cell cultures and xenograft studies followed by a retrospective population
study based on data from the Taiwan national health insurance system. In cell cultures
and xenograft studies, GCs were shown to unequally compromise the anti-cancer
efficacy of TKIs in both PC9 and NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells models. In the retrospective
population study, patients with similar disease status that were co-medicated with
GCs had a significantly higher risk of disease progression.

INTRODUCTION

reviews have revealed that concomitant use of GCs and
chemotherapeutics would reduce the efficacy of the latter
in patients with solid tumors [17–21]. However, the
potential effects of GCs in lung cancer patients treated
with gefitinib remain unclear. Therefore, the goal of this
study was to examine whether concomitant use of GCs
might compromise the anti-cancer efficacy of target
therapy through cell cultures, xenografts, and a population
study. Since long-term randomised trials involving the
concomitant use of GCs and gefitinib are not feasible due
to potential hazards that may be imposed to patients, we
employed a retrospective population study based on data
from the Taiwan national health insurance system to assess
the effects of GCs in gefitinib treated NSCLC patients.
The National Health Insurance Research Database
(NHIRD) in Taiwan encompasses the entire 23 million
residents; being one of the largest nationwide population
database in the world. Since 1995, the NHI program has
provided universal coverage of more than 99% of the
population in Taiwan. Owing to its enormous sample size,
the NHIRD permits a wide range of study design, such
as drug adverse effects and risks of disease, drug safety
and efficacy, drug prescription and utilization patterns,
prognosis and health outcome researches [22].
In this study, the potential hazards of concomitant
administration of GCs with gefitinib for NSCLC
treatments were assessed in cell culture, xenograft models,
and patients with drug-sensitive EGFR mutations that
were covered by NHIRD to receive gefitinib as the firstline therapy.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in
the world [1]. Approximately 85% of lung cancer cases are
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including squamous
cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma,
with the rest being small cell lung cancer [2]. Treatment
modalities of NSCLC include surgery, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy and target therapy. In the past decade,
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeting
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and
erlotinib have shown remarkable benefits in all stages
of NSCLC patients with drug-sensitive mutations in the
EGFR gene [3, 4]. Different from chemotherapeutics, the
EGFR-targeting drugs showed much lower side effects
with significant anti-cancer efficacy in patients harboring
drug-sensitive EGFR mutations.
In Taiwan, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients have a more than 50% response rate to
treatment involving epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) because of
a high incidence of somatic activating mutations [3–6].
Consequently, since June 2011, the Taiwan National
Health Insurance (NHI) policy has included gefitinib as
first-line therapy for NSCLC patients with diagnoses of
drug-sensitive mutations in EGFRs. In previous clinical
study, combination of gefitinib with chemotherapeutics
in advanced NSCLC showed no improved efficacy [7].
When patients are confirmed with drug-sensitive EGFR
mutations, gefitinib alone was recommended as the firstline therapy.
However, almost all patients with drug-sensitive
EGFR mutations who initially responded to gefitinib
or erlotinib eventually developed resistance to these
target therapeutics and switched to chemotherapy.
Thus, researchers have been striving to understand and
overcome such a problem [8, 9]. Comparing to new drug
development, it is equally important to maximize the
efficacy of the existing target drugs.
GCs are useful in management of clinical
oncology. They not only benefit to treatment of
hematologic malignancy, but also help to reduce the
pain and the suffering during cancer therapy [10].
Comedication with GCs as prophylaxes have been
highly recommended for alleviation of severe side effects
caused by chemotherapeutic drugs [11, 12]. In contrast to
chemotherapy, systemic administration of GCs is not a
standard practice for managing adverse reactions caused
by gefitinib treatment in NSCLCs, with the exception of
critical conditions such as interstitial lung disease [13–16].
However, we observed from the NHI claims database
that more than a quarter of patients (26.5%) were comedicated with oral form GCs, including dexamethasone,
methylprednisolone and prednisolone, during the course
of gefitinib treatment.
The use of GCs as co-medication in NSCLC
has long been under debate. Some comprehensive

RESULTS
Effectiveness of EGFR-TKIs was reduced by
treatment with GCs in drug sensitive NSCLC
cells
To determine whether GCs reduced the sensitivity
of NSCLC cells to EGFR-TKIs, we treated PC9 cells
(EGFRexon19del E746-A750) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFRL858R/
T790M
) with gefitinib and afatinib, respectively, either
alone or in combination with a GC. PC9 cells are very
sensitive to gefitinib (IC50 = 60 nM, IC80 = 200 nM),
whereas NCI-H1975 cells are sensitive to afatinib but
not gefitinib, owing to a second mutation on EGFR i.e.,
a substitution of methionine for threonine at position
790 (T790M) (IC50 = 300 nM, IC80 = 500 nM) [23]. The
cells were treated with the respective EGFR-TKIs at their
IC80 values: 200 nM for gefitinib treatment of PC9 cells
and 500 nM for afatinib treatment of NCI-H1975 cells.
Cells were treated with TKIs alone or in combinations
with either, dexamethasone (Dex), prednisolone or
mometasone. An Annexin V-propidium iodide staining
followed by flow cytometry analysis was employed to
assay apoptosis of the cells (Figure 1). As can be seen
in Figure 1A and 1B, approximate 35% of the PC9 cells
were in the apoptotic state after treatment with gefitinib

alone, whereas only 8.5% of the cells were apoptotic after
treatment with vehicle control. Strikingly, the percentage
of apoptotic PC9 cells dropped substantially when any of
the GCs was combined with gefitinib, and the otherwise
sensitive NCI-H1975 cells became insensitive to afatinib
when it was combined with a GC. Another cell line
that is sensitive to gefitinib, NCI-H3255 (EGFRL858R),
was also used to determine the anti-apoptotic effects of
Dex. In NCI-H3255 cells, the percentage of apoptotic
cells upon gefitinib treatment was reduced by Dex
(Supplementary Figure S1).
To further investigate the dose effects of GC,
the very commonly used Dex was serially diluted and
combined with TKIs in cell treatment. Figure 1C and 1D
showed that a very low amounts of Dex (0.02 μM) was
sufficient to dramatically inhibit TKIs induced apoptosis in
cell culture test. The anti-apoptotic effect of Dex remained
the same even when Dex was added to cells 24 hours after
the addition of TKI, indicating that a brief exposure to
Dex may still reduce the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs in the
treatment of NSCLC cells (Figure 1E, 1F).

Figure 3A, administration of gefitinib alone could effectively
shrink the tumor size; all tumors disappeared after 10 days
of gefitinib treatment. In contrast, the anti-tumor effects of
gefitinib were reduced when co-administered with Dex in
a dose-dependent manner. In the 0.07 mg/kg arm, the sizes
of tumors decreased in a much slower rate than those in
mice receiving gefitinib alone. In the 0.35 mg/kg arm, the
anti-cancer efficacy of gefitinib was further reduced. Since
early apoptotic response is an important indicator for the
anti-cancer efficacy, tumors were taken out of the animals
for analysis after 3 days of daily drug treatment. In Figure
3B, it is clear that the gefitinib-triggered caspase 3 mediated
apoptosis could be dramatically inhibited by Dex.
The anti-apoptotic effects of Dex were also observed
in gefitinib-resistant NCI-H1975 cells (EGFRL858R/T790M)
grown in nude mice. In Supplementary Figure S2, the
growth of NCI-H1975 xenograft tumors (300 mm3) could
be inhibited with afatinib (20 mg/kg). When Dex were
co-administered with afatinib (p < 0.05), the efficacy of
afatinib was significantly compromised without difference
in body weight changes (Supplementary Figure S2A, S2B).
It is evident that the afatinib-induced apoptosis in tumors
was also inhibited as characterized by less cytoplasmic
shrinkage and nuclear chromatin in H&E staining and less
cleaved caspase 3 positive cells in mice receiving afatinib
and Dex concomitantly (Supplementary Figure S2C).
Interestingly, in either PC9 or NCI-H1975 xenograft
model, the Dex only treatment groups showed mild tumor
inhibition results. This was compatible with previous
studies, GC monotherapy limited tumor growth in some
lung cancer cells [21].

The anti-apoptosis effectiveness of GCs were
blocked by glucocorticoid receptor inhibitor,
RU486, in EGFR-TKIs treated NSCLC cells
In a previous study, glucocorticoid receptor (GR)
was suggested as an important mediator for disruption of
death signaling pathways by cisplatin [24]. To explore the
underlying mechanism, a potency GR inhibitor, RU486
(mifepristone), was employed to examine whether Dex
exerted its anti-apoptotic effects in gefitinib-treated PC9
cells through the action of GR. When RU486 combined
into the groups of Dex and TKIs, the Dex induced antiapoptosis effect was compromised in both NSCLC celllines (Figure 2A, 2B). The antagonistic effect of Dex was
likely to be exerted through the action of GR.
Since the loss of mitochondria membrane potential
(MMP) is a hallmark of intrinsic apoptosis, we examined
whether the anti-apoptotic effects of Dex were mediated
through the regulation of MMP (Δψm). PC9 and
NCI-H1975 cells were treated with each drugs and their
combinations in a manner similar to that as in Figure 2A
and 2B. Evidently, the MMP was severely compromised in
PC9 cells treated with gefitinib and in H1975 cells treated
with afatinib, as compared to cells treated with vehicle
control (Figure 2C, 2D). The addition of Dex could fully
antagonize the effect of the TKIs on MMP depolarization.

Population data
In the retrospective study, information from the
NHI claims database was employed. Among the NSCLC
patients from June 2011 to December 2012, we found that
2,231 patients with drug-sensitive EGFR mutations have
been treated with gefitinib as first-line therapy, without any
chemotherapeutics before. According to the latest Taiwan
Cancer Registry report, these study cases were thus largely
composed of stage IV NSCLC patients [25]. We excluded
all the patients with brain metastasis which usually received
GCs to relieve pain or edema. The injection form of GCs
was also excluded due to its possibility of emergency
use. Only the patients prescribed with oral forms of GCs
were isolated for the following analysis. To further wash
out the potential bias caused by the emergency use in the
gefitinib treated patients, we extracted the study objects
who received accumulated GCs prescription for more than
3 months. To further reduce possible confounding effects
caused by covariates such as metastasis, endotracheal
intubation, respiratory diseases (including chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchitis) and
diabetes, propensity score matching was applied. Of note,
the flow scheme related to the selection of study subjects
for this study is shown in Figure 4A.

Dex compromised the anti-cancer efficacy of
gefitinib in NSCLC xenografted animal model
To determine whether Dex interfered the anti-tumor
effects of gefitinib in mice xenograft, Dex (0.07 or 0.35 mg/
kg) was orally co-administered with gefitinib (20 mg/kg)
into tumor-bearing mice every day when PC9-xenographed
tumor size reached 800 mm3 in mice. As shown in

After matching, no significant difference
was found in disease conditions between cohorts
with or without comedication with GCs (Table 1).
Although it is not possible to control un-observed
confounding factors, that no difference between the
cohorts in initial stage (1–4 months) in the KaplanMaier analyses indicates similar disease conditions
between the two cohorts on the index date (Figure 4B).

After the initial stage, the probability of progression-free
(PF) became significantly higher in the gefitinib-only
group than those in the gefitinib+GC groups. Cox
proportional hazard model was employed to assess
excess risk of the subjects using GC comedications. The
hazard ratio (HR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
of the GCs comedication group was 1.96 (1.51–2.54)
(Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION

e.g., CDK2, CDK4, and cyclin D1 etc., as suggested by
Greenberg and colleagues [26].
Results from previous clinical studies indicated
that EGFR TKIs such as gefitinib and afatinib should
be considered as first-line treatment options for patients
with mutation-positive EGFR [27, 28]. In 2013, afatinib
was approved as a first-line treatment for patients with
metastatic lung adenocarcinoma because of the finding
that afatinib led to greater PFS when compared to the
standard chemotherapy, cisplatin and pemetrexed [29].
Most patients who initially respond to the TKI therapy
inevitably relapse with the median PFS ranging from 8.4
months (WJTOG3405, randomized phase III trial) to 13.7
months (LUX-Lung 6, randomized phase III trial). It has
been intensively investigated whether novel agents or
treatment modalities can prolong the PFS for this subset of
NSCLC patients receiving EGFR TKIs. Results from this
study strongly suggest a new direction; that is, cautious
uses of GCs may avoid undesirable shortening of PFS in
NSCLC patients receiving TKI treatments.
The population data in this study was derived
from the NHIRD encompassing the entire 23 million

It has been known that concomitant use of
glucocorticoids (GCs) and chemotherapeutics may reduce
the efficacy of the latter in patients with solid tumors.
Keith et al. reviewed 54 randomized controlled trials in
which GCs were used in cancer patients and found that
lung cancer patients receiving both chemotherapeutics
and GCs had worse outcomes than those who received
chemotherapeutics alone [17]. This current translational
study integrated in vitro cell culture, xenograft animal
models, and a population study to assess the harmful
effects of concomitant use of GCs and gefitinib on
NSCLC treatments. All results pointed to the same
direction. That is, efficacy of gefitinib could be greatly
compromised by the often co-administered GCs, and
this GCs induced anti-apoptosis of EGFR-TKI-treated
NSCLC cells possibly mediated by GR. It is interesting
to note that Dex alone had slight inhibition of tumor
growth in tumor xenografts (Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure S2). It is likely that such minor effects is due to
inhibition of cell growth through cell cycle regulators,

national population [22]. Retrospective studies employing
information from NHIRD might be the best way to reveal
potential detrimental effects of this kind since it is unlikely
to justify prospective clinical trials for assessing potential
hazardous effects of GCs. By realizing the possible
confounding factors, in this study, we focused on oral form
GCs which were administrated for more than 3 months and

eliminated the brain-metastasis patients that recommended
GCs as therapeutics. Furthermore, we strived to minimize
possible confounders by propensity score matching
between patients. After the differences between the
groups were minimized, the risk of progression remained
significantly higher in the gefitinib+GC groups than the
gefitinib only group. The most common side effects of

EGFR TKIs such as gefitinib include epidermal reactions,
diarrhea, nausea and vomiting [30]. Personalized
medications may be needed for alleviation of the adverse
reactions in different patients. For the common skin
rashes, topical GCs were recommended for mild (NCICTC grade-1) and moderate (NCI-CTC grade-2) reactions.
Systematic administration of GCs would be only needed
for severe reactions (NCI-CTC grade-3) [31].
The current retrospective study using the NHIRD
did suffer from several limitations. First, the potency
of GCs used was not available in the NHIRD. On the
NHIRD drug list, there are more than 400 kinds of GCs
drugs, with varied potency and dosage, and therefore
converting the dosages and duration into the same units
would be difficult. Second, cancer staging information,
prognostic variables such as disease stage, performance
status, weight loss and histology were not available in
the NHIRD. However, the latest Taiwan Cancer Registry
report showed that there were 1,409 cases of lung cancer
applied for target therapy in 2012, and 1,287 (91.5%) were
in stage IV [25]. As such, our study subjects would very
likely compose of cases of mostly stage IV NSCLC. Third,
the relevant data for NSCLC patients receiving erlotinib or
afatinib in the NHIRD have not been released for research
purpose at the time of this study although prescription
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of erlotinib or afatinib was also approved by NHI for
qualified NSCLC patients. Despite these limitations,
the population data provides added value to support the
conclusion of cell-base and xenograft model results.
Newer generation of EGFR TKIs such as afatinib,
rociletinib (CO-1686), and AZD9291 have shown great
promises [32, 33]. For AZD9291 and CO1686, the
induction of apoptosis in NCI-H1975 cells upon treatment
with each different TKI was also greatly suppressed
by Dex (Supplementary Table S1). Taken together,
concomitant use of a GC in alleviating side effects in
NSCLC patients treated by TKIs should be greatly
cautioned and future investigations on signal transduction
studies will certainly be needed for better understanding
the impact of GCs on inhibition of EGFR TKIs.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement
All the works performed in animals were approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC) respectively, and were carried out in accordance
with the approved guidelines. For PC9 xenograft mice
model, the protocol was approved by the IACUC at the

Determination of mitochondrial membrane
potential

National Health Research Institutes (approval no. NHRIIACUC-103020A), and the protocol of the NCI-H1975
xenograft mice model was approved by the IACUC at the
Taipei Medical University (approval no. LAC-2013-0139).
For population data study, the protocol design of the
data from National Health Insurance Research Database
(NHIRD) was approved by the ethical committee of
the National Health Research Institutes (approval code
is EC 1020904-E). This is an insurance claim data and
all the identifiers were scrambled. No individual can be
identified. Both cell lines used in the current study can
be obtained commercially and they were classified as the
lowest risk by the institutional review board of National
Health Research Institute. The ethics approval was not
required for the use of these cell lines.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆ψm) was
determined by BDTM MitoScreen Flow Cytometry
Mitochondrial Membrane Potential Detection Kit
(BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA). Briefly,
cells were seeded and treated by the indicated drug
combination as described above. All the cells were
harvested and then followed by centrifugation and stained
by JC-1 (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenz
imidazolcarbocyanine iodide) as per manufacturer’s
recommendations. The residual JC-1 was removed by
centrifugation and the pellet was mixed with 1x assay
buffer. The changes of mitochondrial ∆ψm was analyzed
by FACS Calibur flow cytometer according to the dual
fluorescence characteristic of the JC-1. When cells are
healthy, the mitochondria membrane is polarized, and
JC-1 is rapidly taken up by such mitochondria leading to
rapidly increased concentration and results in aggregates
which show red spectral shift in FL-2 channel. When
mitochondria membrane is depolarized, JC-1 leaks out
of the mitochondria into the cytoplasm as monomers
resulting in a decrease of red fluorescence. The quantified
data were expressed as the percent of ∆ψm depolarization.

Cell culture and reagents
We used two types of NSCLC cells with respective
EGFR mutations for this study: PC9 cells (EGFRexon19del
E746-A750
) and NCI-H1975 cells (EGFRL858R/T790M). The
PC9 cells were kindly provided by Dr. Pan-Chyr Yang
at National Taiwan University, and the NCI-H1975 cells
were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(Manassas, VA). PC9 cells are very sensitive to gefitinib
(PC9: IC50 = 60 nM, IC80 = 200 nM), whereas NCI-H1975
cells are sensitive to afatinib (IC50 = 300 nM, IC80 = 500
nM) but not gefitinib, owing to a second mutation on
EGFR, i.e., a substitution of methionine for threonine
at position 790 (T790M) [23]. Cells were maintained as
previously described [34]. All cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 growth medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gibco, Invitrogen),
penicillin, and streptomycin (Invitrogen) in humidified
5% CO2 at 37 °C. The treatment drugs gefitinib (Ryss
Lab, Inc., Union City, CA), afatinib (LC Laboratories,
Woburn, MA), dexamethasone, prednisolone, mometasone
and mifepristone (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) were
commercially obtained. Stock solutions (10 mM) of all
chemicals were prepared in DMSO.

Xenograft murine models
For PC9-xenografted model, 20 female SCID mice
(BioLASCO, Taiwan) 6–8 weeks of age were used in
this study. Human lung cancer PC9 cells (5 × 106/mouse)
were injected into the abdominal region of the SCID mice
subcutaneously. Mice were randomly divided into five
groups (n = 4) when tumor size reach 800 mm3, and were
administered with gefitinib (20 mg/kg) alone or gefitinib
plus dexamethasone (0.07 or 0.35 mg/kg) orally every
day for a total of 8 treatments. One animal in each group
was sacrificed and tumor was removed for the following
analysis. Tumor size was measured by using the formula:
tumor size = length × width × width / 2. For NCI-H1975
model, male nude mice (BioLASCO, Taiwan) were 5
week-old and had a body weight ranged from 20 to 24 g at
day one of the study. Mice were injected subcutaneously
with the same volume of BD Matrigel Matrix HC (BD
bioscience, catalog 354248) and NCI-H1975 cells (1 × 107
cell/mouse) into the flank of each animal. When the tumors
had grown to the size around 300 mm3, mice were divided
into four groups (n = 10) and received the following
treatment daily by oral gavage for 14 days during the
study, including vehicle (DMSO), afatinib (20 mg/kg),
dexamethasone (0.30 mg/kg) and afatinib (20 mg/kg)
co-administered with dexamethasone (0.30 mg/kg)
respectively. Tumor size was measured twice weekly and
calculated from tumor size = length × width × width / 2.
At the end of study, tumors were carefully removed for
subsequent analysis.

Apoptosis assay
PC9 or NCI-H1975 cells (2 × 105 cells/per well) were
seeded in 6-well plates and cultured overnight. Drugs were
diluted in culture medium at the desired concentrations and
were applied to cells. After drug treatment for 48 hours, all
cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and resuspended
in binding buffer (0.01 M HEPES, pH 7.4; 0.14 M NaCl;
2.5 mM CaCl2) on ice. Annexin V-FITC (BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA) and propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO) were then used to stain the apoptotic cells.
Cell samples were analyzed by flow cytometry with a
FACS Calibur machine (BD Bioscience, Franklin Lakes,
NJ), and apoptosis percentages were analyzed by means of
CellQuest Pro software (BD Bioscience).

Immunohistochemistry in the tumor tissue

Definition of progression

Tumors isolated from xenograft mice were embedded
in paraffin blocks. Immunostaining was performed on 5-μm
thick sections of tumor tissue. Tissue slides were performed
microwave antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for
10 min prior to peroxidase quenching with 3% H2O2 in PBS
for 10 min. Tissue sections were incubated with anti-cleaved
caspase-3 (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA) at 4°C overnight
and then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibodies
for 1 h following a washing step with PBS, streptavidinHRP was applied. Finally, the sections were developed with
diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) substrate for
10 min, and counterstained with hematoxylin.

Patients with progression were defined as: (1)
switched to prescription of a new chemotherapeutic
drug, or (2) death. In practice, if first-line EGFR-TKItreated NSCLC patients clinically progressed to a worse
condition, chemotherapy would be subsequently applied.
The following chemotherapeutics (ATC code: L01XA01,
L01XA02, L01BC05, L01CD02, L01CB01, L01BA04,
L01CD01, L01CA04 and L01BC53) were defined
according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC)
classification system [35], and extracted from NHIRD.

Statistical analysis in cell culture and animal
studies

We computed and compared the distributions of
demographic and clinical characteristics of the study subjects
between GC-used and non-GC used groups using the chisquare test for categorical variables and F-test for continuous
variables, separately. To control for potential confounding
effects associated with GCs uses, we had excluded all the
patients with brain metastasis (ICD9-CM 198.3), and that
the matching for propensity score was applied to minimize
the characteristic differences between patients who received
or did not receive GCs. A propensity score is the predicted
probability of an exposure, say using GCs. When propensity
scores are similar, the distribution of observed baseline
covariates would be similar between the two groups [36]. A
SAS-macro is available for the computation and matching
cases and controls [37]. In detail, the propensity score in
this study was calculated using gender and age, as well as
disease status including metastasis (ICD-9- CM 196-198),
endotracheal intubation (NHI operation code 47031C),
diabetes (ICD-9-CM 250), hypertensive heart disease
(ICD-9-CM 402-404), kidney disease (ICD9-CM 580588), respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, asthma, and bronchitis (ICD-9-CM
490-519) which recorded before first dose of gefitinib
administration. The patients in the gefitinib+GC groups were
matched with those in the gefitinib-only group at a ratio
of 1:4. After matched by propensity score, there were no
significant difference in these disease conditions (Table 1).
The Cox proportional hazards model with adjustment
of age and sex was used to compare the probability of
progression-free in the gefitinib+GC to gefitinib-only
groups. The gefitinib-only group served as the reference
group. Additionally, we plotted Kaplan-Meier curves for
probability of progression-free between the gefitinib-alone
group and the concomitant use of studied GCs group over
the observation period. P-values less than 0.05 were declared
to be statistically significant. All analyses were performed
using SAS version 8.2 (SAS institute, Cary, NC).

Statistical methods

Statistical analysis was performed by means of
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results are
showed as means ± SEM. A p-value less than 0.05 was
considered as statistically significant.

Population data
Data source and study cohort
The population data for this study came from the
reimbursement medical claims data collected in the
NHIRD, derived from the National Health Insurance
(NHI) program in Taiwan. Briefly, the NHI program was
implemented in 1995, and 98.4% of Taiwan’s population
of 23 million was enrolled in the program by 2007. The
ICD-9-CM (International Classification of Diseases,
9th revision, clinical modification) was used to identify
NSCLC patients. Patients who had at least two clinical
visits or one hospitalization for lung cancer (ICD-9-CM
162) were considered as confirmed cases.

Exposure to gefitinib and/or glucocorticoids
treatment
Patients who were on first-line gefitinib treatment
from June 2011 to December 2012 were selected since the
Taiwan NHI policy started to cover the use of gefitinib as
first-line therapy for NSCLC in June of 2011. Data after
December 2012 has not yet been released by the Ministry
of Health and Welfare. According to Taiwan’s NHI policy,
only patients with drug-sensitive EGFR mutations can be
reimbursed for prescription with gefitinib as the first-line
therapy. Patients co-medicated with gefitinib with either
of the three kinds of GCs, including dexamethasone,
methylprednisolone, and prednisolone prescribed in oral
form, were extracted from the prescription record. The
GCs drug-day was also calculated. Only the patients
prescribed with GCs for an accumulation of more than 3
months (84 days) were considered as GCs user.
