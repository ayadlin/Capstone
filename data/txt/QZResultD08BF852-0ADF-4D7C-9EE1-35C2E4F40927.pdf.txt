Abstract
Of the anticipated 50,000 individuals expected to be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2016, the
majority will have metastatic disease. Given the noncurative nature of advanced pancreatic
adenocarcinoma, treatment is aimed at inducing disease regression, controlling symptom, and
extending life. The last 5 years have been marked by advances in the treatment of metastatic
pancreatic cancer, specifically the approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of 2
combination chemotherapy regimens and the widespread use of a third, which have reproducibly
been shown to improve survival. Ongoing studies are building on these regimens along with
targeted and immunotherapeutic agents. This article will review the current treatment standards
and emerging targets for metastatic pancreatic cancer.

INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAC) is expected to be diagnosed in approximately 53,070
individuals in 2016 and is the 11th most common cause of cancer. However, this disease
represents the third highest cause of cancer-related deaths, with 41,780 deaths estimated to
occur in 2016.1 This review will focus on standard therapy for patients with metastatic PAC
and emerging directions.

Chemotherapy in the Treatment of Metastatic Disease

Author Manuscript

Cytotoxic chemotherapy—In 1997, gemcitabine was determined to be the standard
treatment for patients with metastatic PAC when it was identified as being superior to 5fluorouracil (5-FU) in a randomized study of 125 patients. Patients receiving gemcitabine
were found to have improved overall survival (OS) compared with those receiving 5-FU
(median OS of 5.7 months for gemcitabine and 4.4 months for 5-FU [P=.0025]).2 Many
gemcitabine-based combinations have been evaluated to date, and the majority of trials have
found no meaningful improvements when combining gemcitabine with cytotoxic agents
(Table 1).3–20 Two meta-analyses of these trials did note improvements in OS and the
response rate (RR) with gemcitabine-based combinations for those patients with an Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 1.21,22

In 2011, the PRODIGE 4/ACCORD 11 study (Partenariat de Recherche en Oncologie
Digestive/Actions Concertees dans les Cancers Colo-Rectaux et Digestifs) was reported and
evaluated a combination of 5-FU, leucovorin (LV), irinotecan, and oxaliplatin
(FOLFIRINOX) compared with gemcitabine for patients with newly diagnosed metastatic
PAC with a good PS (ECOG PS of 0–1).13 Patients receiving FOLFIRINOX experienced a
median OS of 11.1 months with a 31.6% objective RR, compared with a median OS of 6.8
months (hazard ratio [HR], 0.57; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.45–0.73) and an
objective RR of 9.4% among patients receiving gemcitabine (P<.001).13 Significant
increases in toxicity with FOLFIRINOX compared with gemcitabine were observed with
regard to neutropenia (45.7% vs 21%; P<.001), diarrhea (12.7% vs 1.8%; P<.001), and
neuropathy (9% vs 0%; P<.001). Although side effects were increased with this
combination, fewer patients receiving FOLFIRINOX noted a degradation to their quality of
life compared with patients receiving gemcitabine (31% vs 66%; HR, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.3–
0.7]).23 Those patients receiving FOLFIRINOX noted that time until deterioration was
prolonged compared with that of patients receiving gemcitabine (HR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.3–
9.5).13,23 These findings suggest that improvement in symptoms outweighed the increased
toxicities observed with FOLFIRINOX in patients with good PS.

Author Manuscript

Also in 2011, a phase 1/2 study of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in 67 patients with an
excellent PS demonstrated an RR of 48% with a median OS of 12.2 months.14 Due to these
promising findings, the phase 3 Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma Clinical Trial
(MPACT) ensued, in which 861 patients (with an ECOG PS of 0–2 or a Karnofsky PS of
70%–100%) were randomized to receive gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine
alone.15 This study reported an OS of 8.5 months and an RR of 23% for patients receiving
gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel compared with an OS of 6.7 months (HR, 0.72; 95% CI,
0.62–0.83) and an RR of 7% for patients receiving gemcitabine (P<.0001).15 It is interesting
to note that the MPACT study included patients with an ECOG PS of 0 to 2, whereas the
PRODIGE/ACCORD 11 study included only those patients with an ECOG PS of 0 to 1.
Based on these data, the combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is recommended as
a first-line treatment of patients with metastatic PAC and either FOLFIRINOX or the
combination of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel is an appropriate choice for the treatment of
patients with untreated metastatic PAC.

Nanoliposomal irinotecan—Irinotecan has known activity in PAC as evidenced by its
role in FOLFIRINOX and in multiple single-agent and combination studies.7,13,24–29
Nanoliposomal irinotecan includes the free base of irinotecan within a liposome barrier,
which impairs irinotecan metabolism and allows for increased plasma and, potentially,
intratumoral exposure of irinotecan and its active metabolite SN-38. In a single-arm phase 2
study in which patients previously treated with gemcitabine received nanoliposomal
irinotecan, OS was measured at 5.2 months.30 The phase 3 NAnoliPOsomal Irinotecan-1
(NAPOLI-1) study compared nanoliposomal irinotecan and 5-FU/LV among patients
previously treated with gemcitabine.31 A total of 417 patients were randomized to treatment
with nanoliposomal irinotecan plus 5-FU/LV, nanoliposomal irinotecan alone, or 5-FU/LV
alone, with a median OS of 6.1 months, 4.9 months, and 4.2 months, respectively, reported.
The combination of nanoliposomal irinotecan and 5-FU/LV compared with 5-FU/LV alone
resulted in improvements in the median OS (6.1 months vs 4.2 months; HR, 0.67 [95% CI,
0.49–0.92]). The OS for patients receiving single-agent nanoliposomal irinotecan compared
with 5-FU/LV alone was found to be similar (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.77–1.28).31 As a result of
these findings, the combination of 5-FU/LV and nanoliposomal irinotecan was approved by
the US Food and Drug Administration for patients previously treated with gemcitabinebased therapy.

Targeted therapies in patients with metastatic PAC—Although targeted therapies
have altered outcomes in several malignancies, their use has met with limited success in
patients with PAC. One example is targeting epidermal growth factor receptor despite
compelling preclinical rationale.16,17,32,33 In a randomized phase 3 study of gemcitabine
compared with gemcitabine and erlotinib, the median OS was found to be significantly
improved from 5.9 months to 6.2 months (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.99).16 Although the
combination of gemcitabine and erlotinib was approved as a treatment option in patients
with metastatic PAC, the modest signal, toxicity, and more recent cytotoxic developments
have resulted in low uptake of this regimen. Other studies evaluating gemcitabine in
combination with targeted therapies such as the epidermal growth factor receptor-directed
antibody cetuximab and antivascular agents have demonstrated no significant improvements
(Table 1).1–20

Author Manuscript

Treatment decision making in patients with metastatic PAC—In practice, the
choice of which chemotherapeutic agents to use is determined by a patient’s PS along with
potential toxicities and patient preference. For fit patients, FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine and
nab-paclitaxel, or consideration of a clinical trial is recommended. For those patients with a
lower PS (ECOG PS≥2), single-agent gemcitabine, gemcitabine-based combinations along
with supportive care, or supportive care alone is recommended.
To improve the tolerability of FOLFIRINOX, modifications to the regimen have been
undertaken. Several single-institution, retrospective studies have reported elimination of the
5-FU bolus, using dose-reduced irinotecan, or using routine growth factor support.34,35
Similar OS and improved toxicity profiles have been reported in studies of full-dose and
dose-adjusted FOLFIRINOX, suggesting that dose-adjusted FOLFIRINOX appears to be
more tolerable than full-dose FOLFIRINOX with limited detrimental effects on efficacy.

Many questions remain regarding the use of these combinations for patients with untreated
metastatic PAC. First, which regimen is superior: FOLFIRINOX or gemcitabine and nabpaclitaxel? Although these regimens have not been compared in the metastatic setting,
insights into their comparative efficacy may come from the ongoing S1505 trial, a Southwest
Oncology Cooperative Group study evaluating induction chemotherapy with FOLFIRINOX
versus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with resectable PAC (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier NCT02562716).

Author Manuscript

Second, what is the optimal sequencing of these regimens? In a retrospective study
evaluating 57 patients receiving gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel after experiencing disease
progression while receiving FOLFIRINOX, patients received a median of 4 cycles of
gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel with a disease control rate of 58%, thereby suggesting that
this combination can add significantly after first-line FOLFIRINOX. Notably, the median
OS was 18 months from the time of first treatment with FOLFIRINOX.36
Third, can we identify which patients are more likely to respond to gemcitabine-based or 5FU-based regimens? Currently, there are no biomarkers with which to determine the
likelihood of response. Yu et al have developed pharmacogenomic RNA-based expression
arrays associated with sensitivity to cytotoxic treatments, including gemcitabine, nabpaclitaxel, FOLFIRINOX, and others.37 These pharmacogenomic models were tested with
circulating tumor cells from patients receiving treatment for metastatic PAC and were found
to predict which patients were likely to respond to 5-FU-based therapies compared with
gemcitabine-based therapies, thereby holding promise for a noninvasive, prospective method
with which to match patients to a particular therapy.37

Fourth, how does the combination of 5-FU/LV and nanoliposomal irinotecan fit into these
regimens, and what is the optimal treatment after gemcitabine-based therapy? Data from the
NAPOLI-1 trial add to several studies designed to answer this question. In Charite
Okologie-003 (CONKO-003), a total of 160 patients previously treated with gemcitabine
were randomized to treatment with either 5-FU/LV or 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin.38 The
median OS in the 5-FU/LV and oxaliplatin arm was found to be significantly improved
compared with that of patients treated with 5-FU/LV alone, at 5.9 months versus 3.3 months,
respectively (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.91).38 However, conflicting findings were
preliminarily reported in the PANCREOX study, in which 108 patients previously treated
with gemcitabine were randomized to treatment with infusional and bolus 5-FU, LV, and
oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) or 5-FU/LV, and the median OS was found to be inferior in patients
receiving FOLFOX (6.1 months vs 9.9 months; P=.02).39 Within the context of these
differing results, the combination of 5-FU/LV and nanoliposomal irinotecan is an emerging
standard after gemcitabine-based therapy.
Although many questions remain regarding the optimal sequencing of therapies in patients
with advanced PAC, the advances in the last 5 years have unequivocally improved outcomes.
Although the OS in patients with this disease is typically measured as <1 year, several
retrospective and limited prospective studies cited above have noted an OS of ≤18 months in
patients with good PS in this era of modern cytotoxic combination therapy.36,40–42

Promising New Targets and Treatment Strategies in Patients With Metastatic PAC

Author Manuscript

Beyond cytotoxics, a major unmet need exists for new therapies. Historically, PAC has been
characterized as a poorly immunogenic tumor harboring no clear actionable molecular
alterations and hallmarked by a dense and inert stroma. Each of these features of PAC is
being explored and, in some instances, debunked entirely. Preclinical work has demonstrated
that there is a dynamic and inhibitory role of PACs and their associated stroma that may
allow for evasion of the immune system. Exploiting this complex interplay among the tumor,
immune system, and stroma is a focus of ongoing trials (Table 2) (Fig. 1).

Author Manuscript

Stromal targeting agents—The dense stroma associated with PAC provides a physical
barrier to chemotherapy.43,44 Preclinical work from Hingorani et al have confirmed a
changing interplay between the tumor and its stroma such that disease progression is
associated with a robust desmoplastic reaction, thereby limiting delivery of therapeutic
agents.45–47 The in vivo administration of PEGPH20, a pegylated recombinant
hyaluronidase, alone and in combination with gemcitabine to mice models with PAC
demonstrated degradation and depletion of hyaluronic acid, a component of the tumor
stroma, with an improvement in RR and prolonged responses.47 Ongoing trials are
evaluating the combination of PEGPH20 with cytotoxic chemotherapy in patients with
newly diagnosed PAC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01839487, NCT01959139, and
NCT02715804) (Table 2).

Author Manuscript

Another dynamic component of the tumor stroma is mast cells, which are required for tumor
progression and angiogenesis.49 Preclinical models have suggested that ibrutinib, an
inhibitor of mast cells, results in antitumor effect, and a trial currently is underway to
evaluate its safety and efficacy in combination with chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifiers NCT02436668 and NCT02562898) (Table 2).50

Author Manuscript

Heparin sulfate proteoglycans within the tumor stroma stimulate tumor growth, and
necuparanib (M402) is a heparin sulfate mimetic that blocks these stimulatory activities.
O’Reilly et al presented a phase 1 trial evaluating the combination of necuparanib,
gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel, and a disease control rate of 88% was noted among the 16
patients who completed the first cycle of treatment.48 This phase 2 study is currently
ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01621243) (Table 2).

Application and investigation of immunotherapy treatments and strategies in
PAC—Some have argued that PAC is a poorly immunogenic tumor given that it lacks
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and high numbers of somatic mutations, features that have
been linked to diseases with responses to immune checkpoint inhibition with anti-cytotoxic
T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or anti-programmed cell death protein 1
(PD-1) antibodies.43,51–58 In a trial of 27 unselected patients with PAC, single-agent
checkpoint inhibitors demonstrated a modest signal of activity.59 No patients experienced an
objective initial response, although one patient did experience a delayed response.59 These
findings are consistent with molecular analysis of PACs, which has found that a subset of
PACs may be more immunogenic than others, suggesting that immunotherapy may be
helpful in a selected patient population.60 In addition, preliminary reports of single-agent

check-point inhibition in patients with mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient pancreatic cancer
are promising, with stable disease noted among 3 of 4 patients with MMR-deficient
pancreatic cancer and 1 of 4 patients experiencing a partial response, thereby expanding on
responses observed with checkpoint inhibition for patients with MMR-deficient colorectal
cancers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01876511).51,61 Given the synergistic effect of
multiple agents targeting checkpoint blockade with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies
in melanoma, combination strategies are ongoing in PAC (Clinical-Trials.gov identifier
NCT02558894) (Table 2).54

Author Manuscript

The tumor stroma also contributes to immune system evasion. Fibroblasts within the stroma
produce chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 1/2 (CXCL1/2), a cytokine that inhibits T-cell
recruitment. CXCL1/2 inhibition was reported to work synergistically with checkpoint
blockade to cause tumor regression in preclinical models.62 This combination strategy
currently is being evaluated in a trial of ulocuplumab (antibody to C-X-C motif chemokine
receptor 4 [CXCR4], a receptor for CXCL1/2) with nivolumab (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02472977) (Table 2).
The chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2)/C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) axis
likely plays an important role in disease progression as well. CCL2 and its receptor CCR2
mobilize inflammatory monocytes to the tumor-stroma microenvironment to promote
metastatic disease. Using in vivo PAC models, CCR2 inhibition was found to result in
decreased tumor growth.63 A phase 1 study found that the CCR2 inhibitor CCX872-B was
tolerable as a single agent, and a phase 1B study currently is ongoing with CCX872-B
combined with FOLFIRINOX (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02345408) (Table 2).64

Author Manuscript

Immunotherapy using the GVAX and CRS-207 vaccines also has been studied in patients
with PAC. GVAX induces T-cell response against PAC-associated antigens, including
mesothelin. CRS-207 secretes mesothelin into antigen-presenting cells. The combination of
CRS-207 and GVAX is believed to stimulate an autoimmune response to mesothelinexpressing PAC cells. Although preliminary reports evaluating the combination of these
agents suggested a tolerable side effect profile and promising efficacy, an interim analysis
from the phase 2b ECLIPSE (Safety and Efficacy of Combination Listeria/GVAX Pancreas
Vaccine in the Pancreatic Cancer Setting) trial demonstrated no significant difference in OS
for patients receiving CRS-207 with and without GVAX (3.8 months vs 5.4 months).65,66
However, treatment with CRS-207 alone did demonstrate outcomes similar to those of
patients receiving chemotherapy (4.6 months), thereby suggesting some benefit to
CRS-207.66

Author Manuscript

The combination of checkpoint inhibitors and vaccines provides another therapeutic avenue.
The STELLAR trial (Safety and Therapeutic Efficacy of Live-attenuated Listeria/GVAX
with Anti-PDl Regimen) currently is evaluating the activity of this regimen (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02243371) (Table 2). In this randomized phase 2 trial, patients
receive CRS-207/GVAX with and without nivolumab with OS as the primary endpoint.
Another recently completed but not yet reported randomized phase 2 trial study evaluated
the role of ipilimumab with and without the PAC vaccine GVAX in the second-line setting

(Table 2). Further trials investigating novel combinations of immunotherapy, chemotherapy,
and vaccines currently are ongoing, a selection of which are described in Table 2.
Deficiencies in homologous recombination and DNA repair as a biomarker for novel
treatments in patients with PAC

Author Manuscript

Up to 10% to 15% of patients with PAC harbor an increased susceptibility to cancer due to
an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome. The most common germline alterations are
observed in the genes BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 (Partner And Localizer of BRCA2). As
described by Salo-Mullen et al, approximately 15.1% (95% CI, 9.5%–20.7%) of patients
who underwent genetic testing in a clinical genetics service at a tertiary care cancer hospital
were found to have germline pathogenic mutations. Alterations were observed most often in
the genes listed above and genes in the MMR pathway suggestive of Lynch syndrome.
BRCA1/2 and PALB2 play critical roles in the homologous recombination and repair of
DNA double-stranded breaks, and these impaired DNA repair pathways represent another
therapeutic target with platinum agents and inhibitors of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP).

Author Manuscript

Platinum agents cause interstrand crosslinks that ultimately lead to DNA double-strand
breaks. In the setting of deficient homologous repair such as in BRCA-deficient tumors,
platinum agents can exploit this weakness and have been shown to be effective.68,69 Lowery
et al reported that 5 of 6 patients with PAC and germline BRCA1/2 alterations achieved a
partial response to platinum-containing regimens, and another retrospective review of 71
patients with BRCA-associated PAC noted an improvement in OS with platinum-containing
regimens compared with those who did not receive platinum therapies (22 months vs 9
months; P=.039).68,69 Likewise, single-strand DNA breaks require repair and modification
by PARP. PARP inhibition can further limit the ability to repair these single-strand DNA
breaks, resulting in DNA double-strand breaks and cell death within the setting of impaired
homologous recombination. In a phase 2 trial of 23 patients with a germline BRCA1/2
alteration and PAC who received the PARP inhibitor olaparib, 22% achieved a complete or
partial response and 35% achieved stable disease, a finding that is consistent with those
reported in other BRCA-related tumors.70 Given that PARP activity is increased within the
setting of DNA damage, PARP inhibitors administered with platinum agents may have a
synergistic effect that can be used to therapeutic benefit in patients with PACs with deficient
homologous repair mechanisms.

Author Manuscript

Studies currently are ongoing to evaluate the role of platinum and PARP inhibitors in
patients with BRCA-related PAC. Preliminary results from a phase 1B study in which
patients with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 germline alterations received cisplatin, gemcitabine, and
veliparib noted that 9 of 9 patients achieved disease control, with 5 of 9 patients achieving a
partial response and 4 of 9 having stable disease.71 These findings suggest that deficient
homologous recombination as identified by germline BRCA1/2 or PALB2 alterations is a
biomarker for treatment with PARP inhibitors and platinum therapy. Several phase 2 studies
evaluating platinum-based chemotherapy with and without PARP inhibitors currently are
ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers NCT01585805 and NCT01489865) (Table 2). A
phase 3 study is ongoing among patients with metastatic PAC and germline BRCA

alterations in which they receive maintenance therapy with a PARP inhibitor after disease
stability is achieved on first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov
identifierNCT02184l95) (Table 2).
Several phase 3 trials also recently have been reported that have demonstrated no significant
benefits after promising phase 1 and 2 studies, thereby highlighting the need for the proper
selection of patients in phase 1 and 2 studies as well as the more efficient use of patient time
and resources with randomized phase 2 studies (Table 3).72–75

Author Manuscript

With respect to molecular understanding of PAC, the vast majority of cases harbor molecular
alterations in ≥1 of the genes KRAS, TP53, CDKN2, and SMAD4, genes that have been
challenging to target successfully using precision medicine approaches at this time. Bailey et
al published a genomic analysis of 456 patients with PAC and identified that the most
commonly mutated genes clustered around 10 pathways, including KRAS transforming
growth factor-β, WNT, NOTCH, DNA repair, and others, many of which do provide
promising therapeutic opportunities (a selection of which are described in Table 2).60 In
addition, many clinicians and patients are seeking next-generation sequencing approaches
with which to search for targetable alterations in tumors. Given the growing number of
“basket studies” with targeted therapies in which patients are selected based on a molecular
alteration rather than a cancer’s site of origin, this presents another opportunity for
investigational treatment.

Author Manuscript

Conclusions—The treatment of patients with metastatic PAC has evolved significantly,
with several new active cytotoxic regimens (FOLFIRINOX, gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel, and
nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU), all of which currently are in common use and have
collectively improved survival. The interplay of the immune system and stromal targeting as
well as enhanced understanding of molecular genomics, the identification of biomarkers and
selected treatments for certain patient subgroups (homologous repair deficiency), and the
emerging ability to classify subsets of patients with this disease collectively contribute to the
optimism that meaningful improvements in patient outcomes for this cancer are on the
horizon.
