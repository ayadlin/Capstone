BACKGROUND: Rates of screening mammography have plateaued, and the number of mammography facilities has declined in the
past decade. The objective of this study was to assess changes over time and geographic disparities in the availability of mammography services. METHODS: Using information from the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Census, county-level mammography capacity was defined as the number of mammography machines per 10,000 women aged  40 years. Cross-sectional variation
and longitudinal changes in capacity were examined in relation to county characteristics. RESULTS: Between 2000 and 2010, the
number of mammography facilities declined 10% from 9434 to 8469, the number of mammography machines declined 10% from
13,100 to 11,762, and the median county mammography capacity decreased nearly 20% from 1.77 to 1.42 machines per 10,000 women
aged  40 years. In cross-sectional analysis, counties with greater percentages of uninsured residents, less educated residents,
greater population density, and higher managed care penetration had lower mammography capacity. Conversely, counties with more
hospital beds per 100,000 population had higher capacity. High initial mammography capacity, growth in both the percentage of the
population aged  65 years and the percentage living in poverty, and increased managed care penetration were all associated with a
decrease in mammography capacity between 2000 and 2010. Only the percentage of rural residents was associated with an increase
in capacity. CONCLUSIONS: Geographic variation in mammography capacity and declines in capacity over time are associated with
demographic, socioeconomic, and health care market characteristics. Maldistribution of mammography resources may explain geoC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Screening mammography reduces breast cancer mortality by approximately 15% in women aged  40 years.1-3 Although
rates of screening mammography have increased substantially in the past 3 decades, approximately 25% of US women
aged  40 years report having no recent screening mammogram, and this percentage varies widely from state to state.4,5 In
addition to its use as a screening and diagnostic tool, mammography is also a fundamental part of posttreatment surveillance among survivors of breast cancer. Approximately 20% of women with a history of breast cancer do not adhere to
guidelines for follow-up mammography.6-10
The availability and accessibility of mammography depend on several factors, including the supply and location of
mammography equipment and personnel. Although prior reports suggested that overall mammography capacity in the
United States was large enough to meet existing needs,11,12 it is not clear whether resources are currently distributed proportionally to the population across local areas or are sufficient to meet national targets for breast cancer screening.13
In light of reported declines in the rates of screening mammography and financial pressures facing many mammography facilities,14-16 it is especially critical to understand how the availability and accessibility of mammography resources
affect mammography use and outcomes. The goals of the current study were to evaluate trends in the number and distribution of mammography resources in the United States and to assess the impact of socioeconomic and health care market
characteristics on changes in the availability of mammography services.
MATERIALS AND METHODS

has maintained administrative records on all certified
mammography facilities in the United States since
1994.17 Facilities are inspected annually, and data
obtained from inspection reports include the number of
mammography machines at each facility. County-level
demographic, economic, and health care market characteristics were obtained from the US Census Bureau, the
Area Resource File, and the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services.
Mammography Capacity

For every county in the United States (n 5 3141), we estimated mammography capacity as the number of mammography machines per 10,000 women aged  40 years.
Women in this age group constitute the population eligible for annual screening mammography.18 Annual mammography capacity was estimated from 2000 through
2010, and each year’s estimate included only machines at
facilities for which the FDA certification was effective for
the entire calendar year. Age-specific estimates of the
female population in each county in each year were
obtained from the 2000 and 2010 Census surveys and
from intercensal population estimates produced by the
US Census Bureau.
County Characteristics

Mammography capacity was assessed in relation to
county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and health
care resource characteristics (Table 1). Information
obtained from the 2000 and 2010 US Census surveys
included the percentage of the population that identified
their race as black, the percentage of the population
aged  65 years, the percentage living below the federal
poverty level, the percentage who did not graduate high
school, the percentage living in rural areas, and population

density (total population per square mile of land area).
From the Area Resource File, we identified the numbers of
primary care physicians and radiologists per 100,000 population in 2002 and 2010, and the number of short-term
hospital beds per 100,000 population in 2000 and 2008,
based on information from the American Medical Association and the American Hospital Association. The percentage of residents lacking health insurance was based on
Small Area Health Insurance Estimates produced by the
US Census Bureau. Medicare managed care penetration in
2000 and 2009, reported by the Centers for Medicare and
Medicaid Services, was used as a proxy for managed care
penetration by all insurers in each county.
Statistical Analysis

We evaluated the impact of demographic, socioeconomic,
and health care resource characteristics on mammography
capacity using multivariable linear regression. In separate
cross-sectional analyses, we assessed the impact of these
characteristics on capacity in 2000 and in 2010. In each
model, the dependent variable was the natural log of
county mammography capacity, and therefore estimated
coefficients can be interpreted as the percentage difference
in capacity associated with each predictor. Predictors in
each model corresponded with the year in which capacity
was defined. We used natural log transformations for population density and the numbers of primary care physicians, radiologists, and hospital beds per population;
other independent variables were already described as percentages and therefore were not log-transformed to facilitate the interpretation of results.
For each county, we estimated the net change in
mammography capacity as the difference between capacity
in 2010 and capacity in 2000. We also estimated the slope

of a regression line fit through the estimates of capacity in
each year for each county, and used Student t tests to assess
whether the estimated slope was statistically significantly
different from zero at an a < .05. Based on these estimates,
we classified each county as having had an increase,
decrease, or no change in mammography capacity during
the study period.
We evaluated the impact of county characteristics
on change in capacity using the natural log of change in
county mammography capacity between 2000 and 2010
as the dependent variable. By using the natural log of
capacity change, the estimated coefficients for each predictor in this regression model can be interpreted as
impacts on the rate of change in county mammography
capacity. Predictors included county demographic characteristics defined in 2000 and the change from 2000 to
2010 in the percentage of the county population who
were aged  65 years, black, lived below the poverty level,
did not graduate high school, lived in rural areas, and
lacked health insurance. We included log-transformed
values of population density and the number of hospital
beds in 2000, the number of primary care physicians and
radiologists in 2002, and the changes in these 4 characteristics. Mammography capacity in 2000 was also included
as a predictor.
RESULTS
Correlates of Capacity

In both 2000 and 2010, counties with greater percentages
of uninsured residents and higher managed care penetration had fewer mammography machines per 10,000 adult
women. Population density and the percentage of residents

without a high school diploma were also negatively
associated with mammography capacity, whereas the number of hospital beds per 100,000 population was associated
with greater capacity (Table 2). In 2000, counties with
more residents living in rural areas had lower mammography capacity, while counties with a greater percentage of
the population at or below the poverty level had higher
capacity. In 2010, counties with more primary care physicians per population had lower mammography capacity,
whereas counties with a greater percentage of residents
aged  65 years had higher capacity.
Changes in Mammography Capacity

In 2000, there were 13,100 mammography machines in
9434 FDA-certified facilities, and the median countylevel mammography capacity was 1.77 machines per
10,000 women aged  40 years. By 2010, there were
11,762 mammography machines in 8469 FDA-certified
facilities, and the median county-level mammography
capacity was 1.42 machines per 10,000 women aged  40
years. These changes represent a 10% decrease in the total
number of machines, a 10% decrease in the number of
facilities, and a nearly 20% decrease in median capacity
(Fig. 1).
Of the 3141 counties, 789 (25%) never had a mammography machine in any year between 2000 and 2010
(Fig. 2). In an additional 686 counties that had at least 1
machine (22% of all counties), the regression slope for
capacity over the study period was not statistically different from zero, suggesting no change in capacity during
this time. In 283 counties (9%), the slope was positive
and was significantly different from zero, reflecting an

through 2010, suggesting a greater rate of decrease in
capacity among counties with higher initial capacity
(Table 3). The percentage of residents without a high
school diploma and the change between 2000 and 2010
in the percentage aged  65 years and the percentage at or
below the poverty level were also negatively associated
with change in mammography capacity over that time period. The percentage living in rural areas in 2000 was
positively associated with change in capacity. Both Medicare managed care penetration in 2000 and the change in
penetration over the study period were found to be negatively associated with change in capacity. Similar relationships were observed for population density and the
change in population density and the number of hospital
beds and change in the number of hospital beds.
DISCUSSION
Mammography remains the only recommended modality
of population-based screening for breast cancer.19-21 In
this analysis, we observed declines in the availability of
mammography facilities and machines between 2000 and
2010, as well as a decrease in county-level mammography
capacity. The counties affected by significant declines in
mammography capacity represented almost three-quarters of the female population aged  40 years.
Several population characteristics were associated
with cross-sectional variation in mammography capacity

as well as changes in capacity over time. Although the percentage of rural residents in 2000 was positively associated
with an increase in capacity between 2000 and 2010,
counties with more rural residents had lower capacity
compared with other counties in each year. The results of
the current study suggest that counties whose populations
had lower educational attainment, increasing poverty
rates, and a growing percentage of elderly residents were
particularly vulnerable to declines in mammography
capacity.
Approximately one-quarter of all US counties had
no mammography facilities in any year. This percentage
was stable over time and similar to prior estimates.22
However, when weighted for the population distribution,
these areas represented only 3% of US women aged  40
years. Lack of resource capacity is likely a barrier to breast
cancer screening in these areas, and initiatives that establish or expand mobile mammography programs in neighboring counties may improve access for women who
reside in zero-capacity counties.
Several health care market factors were found to be
correlated with mammography capacity. Counties with
more uninsured residents or higher managed care penetration had lower capacity and were more likely to experience
a decline in capacity. Both low health insurance coverage
rates and high managed care penetration could potentially
limit the profitability of health care services, especially

preventive services, which may not be generously reimbursed by insurers and may be viewed as unnecessary by
uninsured women who would have to pay for them out of
pocket. Although some studies have found better adherence with breast cancer screening recommendations
among managed care enrollees compared with their peers
who are covered by traditional fee-for-service insurance
policies,23-25 lower mammography capacity may be a barrier to breast cancer screening for women living in areas
with high managed care penetration.
Mammography capacity was not significantly influenced by the number of radiologists per population. This
is not surprising given the relatively low reimbursement of
mammography and other real or perceived negative
attributes of mammography, such as job stress and fear of
malpractice, compared with other types of imaging services.26 Although the mean number of radiologists per
100,000 county residents increased between 2000 and
2010, this change did not improve the availability of
screening mammography for women in most counties,
perhaps because new radiologists chose more lucrative
and technologically interesting practice areas. Thus, policies aimed at the radiology workforce may not be the most
effective levers for improving access to screening
mammography.
Access to mammography has been a particular concern in the United States since the passage of the MQSA,
enacted in 1992, which established national uniform
quality standards for mammography.17,27,28 The MQSA
has been credited with substantial improvements in mammography quality, and in earlier reports federal analysts
concluded that the law has not impaired access to mammography services.29-31 From 1994 to 1997, facility closures were nearly offset by new facility openings or
reopenings, and nearly all facilities that closed were
located within 25 miles of another certified mammography facility.30,31 Between 1998 and 2001, the number
of certified facilities declined by approximately 5%, but
the total number of mammography machines increased
by 11%.12 The declines we observed in mammography
facilities, machines, and capacity per population between
2000 and 2010 were not likely related to federal legislation, but they renew earlier concerns about access to breast
cancer screening services.
The results of the current study also reinforce earlier
anecdotal and empirical evidence that some areas may be
disproportionately impacted by mammography facility
closures. A prior survey of selected counties found that in
some metropolitan areas, demand for mammography has
grown while capacity has declined, leading to long waiting
3852

times and temporary interruptions in mammography
availability.12 Our surveys of mammography facilities in 6
states in 2008 and 2011 suggested that wait times for the
next available screening mammogram appointment are
longer at facilities in counties with lower mammography
capacity.32,33
In the current study, we assumed that the imaging
capacity of every machine is identical, while in fact, newer
mammography machines may be more efficient than
older machines, producing more scans per unit over the
unit’s lifetime. Our study period coincided with the widespread dissemination of digital mammography, which
was approved for clinical use in January 2000. In 2008,
54% of mammography facilities in 6 states reported that
they offered digital mammography or were in the process
of acquiring digital mammography equipment.33 By
2011, 78% of facilities in the same 6 states reported that
they offered digital mammography.32 Compared with
screen-film mammography, digital mammography is
associated with a significantly shorter image acquisition
time.34 In the current study we were not able to account
for variability across facilities with regard to their average
throughput or hours of operation.
Similarly, we addressed neither the availability of
radiologic technologists nor the quality of services provided. The credentials and minimum number of personnel at each facility are regulated by the MQSA to some
extent, and machine condition and image quality are
monitored in mandatory annual facility inspections.
However, some facilities may exceed the minimum standards, contributing to heterogeneity in service quality and
capacity between facilities.
Ultimately, we are concerned with the impact of
mammography capacity on the likelihood of screening.
National surveys have routinely documented geographic
variation in rates of screening mammography use, and
our prior research suggests that women in counties with
inadequate mammography capacity are less likely to
have screening mammograms.35 It is not clear whether
interventions for improving geographic access to screening should involve direct operation or relocation of
resources by public health authorities, incentives for
radiologists to offer screening mammography in lowcapacity areas, or other strategies. However, by identifying county-level demographic and health care market
characteristics associated with lower mammography
capacity and declines in capacity, interventions can target those areas in greatest need of enhanced resource
availability and those at greatest risk of further declines
in mammography capacity.
