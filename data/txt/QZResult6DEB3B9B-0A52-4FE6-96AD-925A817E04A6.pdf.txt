ABSTRACT
A deeper understanding of the complex pathogenesis of multiple myeloma
(MM) continues to lead to novel therapeutic approaches. Prior studies suggest that
3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) is expressed and active, acting as a
crucial regulator of molecules that are essential for myelomagenesis. In the present
study, we show that GSK2334470 (GSK-470), a novel and highly specific inhibitor
of PDK1, induces potent cytotoxicity in MM cell lines including Dexamethasoneresistant cell line, but not in human normal cells. Insulin-like growth factor-1
could not rescue GSK-470-induced cell death. Moreover, GSK-470 down-modulates
phosphor-PDK1, thereby inhibiting downstream phosphor-AKT at Thr308 and mTOR
complex 1 (mTORC1) activity. However, GSK-470 could not affect mTORC2 activity
and phosphor-AKT at Ser473. RPMI 8226 and OPM-2 cells with low expression of
PTEN show relative resistant to GSK-470. Knockout of PTEN by shRNA resulted in a
partial reversion of GSK-470-mediated growth inhibition, whereas overexpression of
PTEN enhanced myeloma cell sensitivity to GSK-470, suggesting that the sensitivity
to GSK-470 is correlated with PTEN expression statue in MM cells. Combining PP242,
a dual mTORC1/C2 inhibitor, with GSK-470, had greater antimyeloma activity than
either one alone in vitro and in MM xenograft model established in immunodeficient
mice. In particular, this combination was able to result in a complete inhibition of
mTORC1/C2 and full activity of AKT. Together, these findings raise the possibility
that combining PDK1 antagonist GSK-470 with mTORC1/C2 inhibitors may represent
a novel strategy against MM including drug-resistant myeloma, regardless of PTEN
expression status.

pomalidomide), proteasome inhibitors (bortezomib,
carfilzomib, and ixazomib), and the histone deacetylase
(HDAC) blocker panobinostat [1-3]. Supplementation of
MM therapy with autologous stem cell transplantation has
further improved median overall survival of the patients,
especially in the patients with standard risk [4]. More
recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved for use in MM two monoclonal antibodies,
daratumumab and elotuzumab, both directed against
glycoproteins expressed on the surface of MM cells [5, 6].

INTRODUCTION
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a molecularly/
symptomatically heterogeneous B-cell malignancy
characterized by the accumulation of clonal malignant
plasma in bone marrow [1]. Over the past decade,
patients with MM are living longer and better due to
the introduction of several classes of drugs recently
approved in the treatment of MM, which include the
immunomodulators (thalidomide, lenalidomide, and

RESULTS

Despite these significant improvements, the cure of
patients with MM remains challenging and difficult.
In MM, aberrant activation of several signal
transduction pathways results in cellular proliferation
and drug-resistance of tumor cells [1]. Therefore, these
signaling cascades may be attractive targets for the
development of innovative therapeutic strategies for
MM patients. The PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway
is frequently activated in myeloma. Loss of the tumor
suppressor PTEN, mutations in receptor tyrosine kinases,
as well as activating PI3K mutations all result in elevated
levels of phosphatidylinositol phosphates, including
PIP3 that activates the AKT pathway [7-10]. PIP3
recruits phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1
(PDK1) and AKT to the plasma membrane wherein
PDK1 directly phosphorylates Thr308 residues of
AKT [11], but requires mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2)induced AKT phosphorylation on Ser473 to confer its
full activation [12]. Currently, AKT is considered to be
the main effector of PDK1 in cancer, thereby targeting
PDK1 may provide an opportunity for developing novel
therapeutics for cancer. Indeed, it has been recently
shown that GSK2334470 (GSK-470), a novel and highly
specific inhibitor of PDK1 [13], inhibits growth, induces
cell cycle arrest and overcomes drug resistance in
human cancer cells [14-16]. In MM, it was demonstrated
that PDK1 is expressed and active in all eleven MMderived cell lines, regardless of the type of cytogenetic
abnormality or the status of upstream signaling
molecules, and that genetic or pharmacological (BX912) inhibition of PDK1 caused the growth inhibition
and the induction of apoptosis, and augmented the in
vitro cytotoxic effects of antimyeloma agents such as
melphalan, etoposide, or bortezomib [17].
Recently, a number of small molecular inhibitors of
PDK1, such as UCN-01, dibenzo [c,f]- [2, 7] naphthyridine
derivatives, celecoxib derivatives, BX-795 and BX912, have been described that are poorly specific and/or
ineffective at suppressing PDK1-dependent pathway in vivo
[18, 19]. Whereas, GSK-470 has been shown to effectively
inhibit PDK1 at very low concentrations, but do not
suppress the activity of 93 other protein kinases including
13 AGC family of protein kinases [13], suggesting it is a
highly specific and potent inhibitor of PDK1. Nevertheless,
its effect and the mechanism of action in the MM context
need to be studied. In the present study, we addressed the
molecular mechanisms of the anti-MM action of GSK-470
and showed that GSK-470 inhibits cellular proliferation
and induces apoptosis. However, myeloma cell lines with
absence or dysfunction of PTEN are relatively resistant to
the drug-induced cell death. Therefore, we next evaluated
to which extent dual targeting of the PDK1 and mTORC1/
C2 pathways can enhance the antimyeloma efficacy.
The findings of the present study provide a rationale
for combination therapy using GSK-470 and PP242, a
mTORC1/C2 inhibitor, for the treatment of MM.

GSK-470 inhibits cellular proliferation and
induces apoptosis possibly related to the function
of PTEN in MM cell lines
The effect of GSK-470 on growth of MM cell lines
was determined by an MTT assay. A dose-dependent
growth inhibition was observed in all tested MM cell
lines following the treatment of GSK-470. The results
showed that ARP-1 and MM.1R cells were sensitive to
GSK-470 with IC50 values of 3.98 µM and 4.89 µM,
respectively. Whereas, RPMI 8226 and OPM-2 cells were
relatively resistant to GSK-470 with IC50 values of 8.4
µM and 10.56 µM, respectively (Figure 1A). To assess
the mechanism of toxicity, the cell lines treated with GSK470 at the indicated concentrations were analyzed for
expression of Annexin V by FACS analysis concomitantly
with PI staining. In accordance with the data on MTT
assay, ARP-1 and MM.1R cells showed higher rates of
apoptosis than RPMI 8226 and OPM-2 cells (Figure 1B).
We next assessed mRNA and protein expression of PTEN
and PDK1, respectively, in MM cell lines because PDK1
inhibition had been shown to be fail to prevent tumor
growth in PTEN-deficient animal models [20]. As shown
in Figure 1C and 1D, there is no significant difference in
the level of PDK1 and phospho-PDK1; however mRNA
and protein expressions of PTEN in ARP-1 and MM.1R
cells were higher than that in RPMI 8226 and OPM-2 cells
that had been demonstrated to be loss of PTEN due to the
deletion spacing from exon 3 to 7 [7, 21]. Correctively,
our data suggested that GSK-470 inhibited proliferation
and induced apoptosis of MM cells, and anti-myeloma
effect of GSK-470 might correlate with the level of PTEN
expression.

GSK-470 induces apoptosis by inhibiting the
phosphorylation of PDK1 and its downstream
AKT/mTOR pathway
To identify the potential cellular target of GSK470 and clarify the underlying molecular mechanism
in GSK-470-induced cell apoptosis, we first examined
the effects of GSK-470 on PDK1 and its downstream
AKT expression by Western blot analysis (Figure 2A),
GSK-470 dose-dependently decreased phosphorylation
of PDK1 at Ser241 and AKT at Thr308 in RPMI 8226
and ARP-1 cells. As expected, GSK-470 also strong
inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR on Ser2448, a
marker for mTORC1 activity, as well as phosphorylation
of 4E-BP1 and p70S6K, the best characterized targets of
mTORC1. However, level of phospho-mTOR at Ser2481
(a marker for the presence of mTORC2 complex) and
its downstream phospho-AKT (Ser473) were not
significantly affected. Consistent with the inhibition of
the PDK1 and AKT/mTOR activity, same doses of the

drug dose-dependently activated caspase pathway, as
evidenced by cleavage and activation of caspase-9, -8,
-3 and downstream PRAP (Figure 2A), which indicates
the activation of apoptosis.
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its
receptor (IGF-1R) play an important role in MM
pathogenesis. IGF-1/IGF-1R triggers a variety
of signaling cascades including AKT, mediating
proliferation, survival, and drug resistance of MM
cells [22, 23]. To investigate whether GSK-470induced inhibition of phospho-AKT can diminish the
stimulatory effect of IGF-1, anti-proliferation effect
of GSK-470 on RPMI 8226 cells in the presence of
exogenous IGF-1 was evaluated. IGF-1 could not
protect against GSK-470-induced growth inhibition
(Figure 2B). Western blotting analysis showed that
IGF-1 treatment resulted in activation of AKT, as
evidenced by increased level of phosphorylated AKT
at Thr308. However, it fail to reverse suppression of
phosphor-AKT at Thr308 and induction of apoptosis
induced by GSK-470 (Figure 2C).

To investigate whether overexpression of PTEN
enhances sensitivity of GSK-470 in MM cells, we infected
RPMI 8226 cells that have low expression of PTEN with a
PTEN adenoviral expression vector, and analyzed cellular
proliferation inhibition and induction of apoptosis by GSK470. As shown in Figure 3A, overexpression of PTEN
resulted in down-regulation of phosphor-AKT (Thr308).
Furthermore, RPMI 8226 cells infected with Ad-PTEN
(RPMI 8226PTEN) are more sensitive to GSK-470-induced
cell death than parent RPMI 8226 cells (Figure 3B, 3C and
3D). To further evaluate if PTEN was related to sensitivity of
MM cells to GSK-470, we examined the effect of knockout
PTEN by shRNA on cell death induced by GSK-470 in
ARP-1 cells. We chosen ARP-1 cells that was infected with
an adenoviral vector expressing PTEN shRNA (Figure 3E),
because high expression of PTEN was observed in ARP-1
cells. As expected, knockout of PTEN resulted in a partial
reversion of cellular growth inhibition (Figure 3F).

Synergistic activity of GSK-470 with mTOR
inhibitor PP242

PTEN is involved in the regulation of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway through its lipid phosphatase
activity [24, 25]. A loss of PTEN functions results in
AKT phosphorylation [26]. We thus examined whether
overexpression of PTEN affects PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway in RPMI 8226 cells and found that PTEN
overexpression led to signiﬁcant decreases in basal
level of phosphor-PDK1 (Ser241), phosphor-AKT
(Ser473 and Thr308) and phosphor-mTOR (Ser2448
and Ser2481). In addition, PTEN overexpression also
inhibited the expression of p110, a class I PI3K isoform.
These effects were enhanced by the treatment of GSK470 (Figure 3D).

Given the facts that GSK-470 failed to inhibit
phospho-mTOR at Ser2448 and its downstream phosphoAKT (Ser473), which was demonstrated in this study, and
that dual mTORC1/C2 inhibitors is much more active
than mTORC1 inhibition alone in myeloma cells [27], we
examined whether PP242, a non-rapalog agent that targets
simultaneously mTORC1 and mTORC2 [28], enhances
GSK-470-mediated cell death. For this, we treated RPMI
8226 and ARP-1 cells with a series of doses of GSK470 or/and PP242. As revealed by MTT assay, GSK-470

with recombinant IGF-1, RPMI 8226 cells were serum starved for 2 h, followed by incubation with or without 100 ng/ml IGF-1 for 2 h.
Then co-cultured with indicated concentrations of GSK-470 for 24 h. Cell growth was assessed by an MTT assay. PARP activation and

RPMI 8226 cells to 82.11% or 65.08%, respectively,
whereas the viability of RPMI 8226 cells treated with the
combination therapy decreased to 45.5% (Figure  4A).
Isobologram analyses confirmed a synergistic anti-myeloma

activity of GSK-470 with PP242 (combination index [CI]
<0.4). Similar result was observed in ARP-1 cells that is
sensitive to GSK-470 (Figure 4B) and in human primary
myeloma cells (Supplementary Figure 2A). PP242 also
potentiated the GSK-470-induced apoptosis as judged by

cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of GSK-470 for 24 h. Cellular proliferation was assessed by an MTT assay. Data are

PRAP (Figure 4D). To analyze the mechanism whereby this
combination treatment mediates synergistic anti-myeloma
toxicity, we next used immunoblotting to examined the
effect of GSK-470, PP242, or combination on AKT/
mTOR pathway. A previous study has shown that PP242
could inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity in MM cells

[29]. Consistent with this report, PP242 inhibited not only
the level of phosphorylated mTOR (Ser2448) as well as
phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrates p70S6kinase
and 4E-BP-1, but also phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2481)
and AKT on Ser473, a mTORC2 substrate (Figure 4E
and Supplementary Figure 2B). Importantly, combining
GSK-470 and PP242 led to complete elimination of
phosphorylated AKT (Ser473/Thr308) and activity of

failed to prevent activation of mTORC2 (Figure 4E).

PP242 proved very efficacious as shown by significant
inhibition of tumor growth compared with GSK-470
(P<0.05) or PP242 alone (P<0.05).
Next, immunohistochemical analyses of the
xenograft tumors that were extracted at 5 days after
treatment were performed to determine if the observed
in vivo effects were mediated by mTORC1/C2 inhibition.
Decreased phosphor-mTOR (Ser2448) expression was
observed in GSK-470 treated tumor sample, whereas
PP242 inhibited phosphorylation of mTOR at both
Ser2448 and Ser2481. This inhibition was enhanced by
GSK-470 and PP242 co-treatment (Figure 5B). Notably,

In vivo activity of GSK-470/PP242 combined

To assess whether the synergistic antimyeloma
effects demonstrated in vitro could be confirmed in vivo,
we used a RPMI 8226 xenograft flank model because
RPMI 8226 is relatively resistant to not only GSK-470
(Figure 1A) but also PP242 (29). As shown in Figure 5A,
tumors in untreated mice grew rapidly and reached the end
point size (an average tumor volume of 2696.02 ± 193.30

regulating RSK2, AKT, c-MYC, IRF4 or cyclin Ds, which
accelerates the drug resistance and the disease progression
[17]. In this study, we first showed that GSK-470, a highly
specific inhibitor of PDK1, directly inhibits growth of MM
cell lines, including Dexamethasone-resistant cell line.
The IC50 values for the 4 myeloma cell lines were 3.9810.56 µM. In contrast, human normal L02 cells and human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were much less
sensitive to GSK-470 (Supplementary Figure 1). This
observation is consistent with a previous study showing
similar effects of PDK1 inhibitors BX-912 and AR-12 in
myeloma cells, with IC50 ranging from 2.5 to 12.8 µM
[17]. Importantly, our analysis also revealed that the level
of sensitivity of MM cell lines to GSK-470 was affected
by PTEN expression, and that PTEN knockdown resulted
in drug resistant while restoration of PTEN expression led

DISCUSSION
PDK1 plays a pivotal role in modulating PI3Kpathway signaling, and is involved in the regulation of
cell metabolism, proliferation, and survival of tumor
cells [30, 31]. Recently, several lines of evidence
indicate that PDK1 can be considered as a promising
target for anticancer drugs and various classes of small
molecular inhibitor targeting PDK1 have been proposed
[32-34]. In MM, PDK1 is generally active and higher
expression than other hematopoietic lineages [17, 35, 36].
Activation of PDK1 is essential for myelomagenesis by

Figure 6: Schematic representation of the signal pathways involved in the combination therapy of GSK-470 and
PP242 in MM. PDK1 inhibitor GSK-470 inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT at Thr308 and mTOR at Ser2448, as well as its direct
targets (4E-BP1 and p70S6K). PTEN affects the antimyeloma effects of GSK-470 by regulating not only PDK1 activity but also mTORC2
formation, thereby inhibiting phosphor- AKT on Ser473. Combined with GSK-470 and mTORC1/C2 inhibitor PP242, can completely
inhibit phosphorylated AKT (Ser473/Thr308) and activity of mTORC1 as well as mTORC2, regardless of the PTEN expression status.

to increased cell death in response to GSK-470 treatment.
The data support the notion that inhibition of PDK1 is
not sufficient to prevent tumor formation and progression
resulting from loss of PTEN [20].
Mechanistically, although GSK-470 significantly
inhibited phosphorylation of PDK1 (Ser241) and mTOR
on Ser2448, a marker for mTORC1 activity, it could
not completely suppress phosphor-AKT (Ser473) in
RPMI 8226 cells with low expression of PTEN, even at
the higher concentration of 4 μM (Figure 2A). This is
also consistent with the finding that in epithelial cells,
combined pharmacological and genetic inactivation of
PDK1 does not suppress AKT activation in a PTENdeficient setting [20]. PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene,
negatively regulates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
through its lipid phosphatase activity [24]. More recent
studies have shown that PTEN also negatively regulates
mTORC2 formation [37, 38]. We show here that PDK1
inhibition by GSK-470 does not lead to a change in the
phosphorylation level of mTOR Ser2481. However, the
overexpression of PTEN in RPMI 8226 cells resulted in
significant decreased level of phosphor-AKT (Ser473
and Thr308) and inhibition of mTORC1/C2 activity as
evidenced by dephosphorylation of mTOR on Ser2448 and
Ser2481. Moreover, this inhibitory effect was enhanced
after treatment with GSK-470. Taken together, our results
provide a novel insight on the molecular mechanism of
PDK1 inhibitor resistance in MM.
Loss or inactivation of PTEN via somatic mutation
or epigenetic silencing is a frequent event in many cancers
[39]. Although PTEN plays a crucial role in regulating
hematopoietic cell proliferation, cell death, and malignant
transformation, its mutations are uncommon in MM
patients [40]. However, it was reported that the level
of PTEN protein expression was significantly lower
in patients with advanced myeloma than in controls,
indicating the relationship between abnormal expression of
PTEN and disease progression [41]. Multiple mechanisms
seem to be implicated in PTEN inactivation in MM
cells including epigenetic silencing by gene promoter
methylation [42] and post-translational modifications
[43-45], thus epigenetic silencing may underlie low
expression of PTEN in RPMI 8226 cells. Increasing lines
of evidence indicate that targeting the mTOR pathway
may represent an efficient strategy against MM [1-3, 29].
In vitro and in vivo studies showed that dual mTORC1/
C2 inhibitor is more active against myeloma cells than
mTORC1 inhibition alone (rapamycin) that could results
in the feedback activation of AKT [27, 46]. But one major
weakness of mTORC1/C2 inhibitor treatment is that it
induces upregulation of IGF-1 receptor phosphorylation
in MM cell lines, which rescues myeloma cells from
apoptosis despite mTOR kinase inhibition and mTORC2/
AKT blockage [47]. Given these observation and the fact
that exogenous IGF-1 did not reverse GSK-470-induce cell
death and GSK-470 could not inhibit mTORC2, there is a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

need to combine dual mTORC1/C2 inhibitor with GSK470 to target and overcome these resistance mechanisms.
In this study, we show that GSK-470 triggers significant
synergistic cytotoxicity by apoptosis of both the GSK470-sensitive and -resistant MM cells in vitro and in vivo
when used in combination with a mTORC1/C2 inhibitor
PP242 [1, 48]. Importantly, this combination treatment
resulted in a complete inhibition of phosphorylation of
AKT on Thr308 and downstream mTORC1 as evidenced
by diminished phosphor-4E-BP1 and phosphor-P70S6K.
Furthermore, cotreatment with low concentration of
GSK-470 (1.25 μM) and PP242 (2 μM) potently inhibited
phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser2481 and its direct target
AKT at Ser473 (Figure 6). Together, our data provide the
rationale for a novel treatment strategy combining selective
PDK1 inhibitor and mTORC1/C2 inhibitor to improve
MM patient outcome, regardless of the PTEN status.
In summary, PDK1 inhibitor GSK-470 in
combination with dual mTORC1/C2 inhibitor PP242
shows significant synergistic antimyeloma effects
regardless of the PTEN status in MM cells, providing
the framework for clinical trials of combined therapy to
improve patient outcome in MM.

cultured in RPMI1640 (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan,
UT, USA), HUVEC and L02 cells were cultured in
DMEM (Hyclone Laboratories) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories) at 37°C in
an incubator with 5% CO2. PDK1 inhibitor GSK-470
and mTORC1/C2 inhibitor PP242 were obtained from
Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX, USA), and dissolved in
dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a stock concentration of 10
mg/ml. IGF-1 was purchased from Peprotech (Rocky Hill,
NJ, USA).

PTEN overexpression by recombinant
adenovirus
The recombinant adenovirus vectors carrying PTEN
gene (Genebank NO: NM_000314) and GFP gene were
purchased from Hanheng Biotech (Shanghai, China).
RPMI 8226 cells (2×105 cells/well) were seeded in a
6-well plate and transfected with recombinant adenovirus

(25 and 50 virus particles/cell). Virus containing solutions
were removed after 2 h and the cells were incubated in
fresh nutrient solution. Protein expression of PTEN was
determined by Western blotting analysis.

were performed as described previously [50]. The
primary antibodies used were as follows: PDK1, p-PDK1
(Ser241), PTEN, mTOR, p-mTOR (Ser2448), p-mTOR
(Ser2481), AKT, p-AKT (Ser473), p-AKT (Thr308),
P70S6K, p-P70S6K (Thr389), 4E-BP1, p-4E-BP1
(Thr37/46), PI3Kp110α, poly(adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase (PARP) and Caspase -8, -9, and -3,
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly,
MA,USA). Monoclonal anti β-actin antibody was purchased
from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).

PTEN knockdown by short hairpin RNA
Three recombinant adenovirus vectors containing
shRNA against PTEN and a negative control scramble
shRNA were purchased from Hanheng Biotech
(Shanghai, China). ARP-1 cells (2×105 cells/well)
were seeded in a 6-well plate and transfected with
adenovirus at a concentration of 100 virus particles/
cell. Virus containing solutions were removed after
2 h, and then the cells were incubated in fresh nutrient
solution. The sequence of shRNA targeting PTEN was 5’CTAGAACTTATCAAACCCTTT-3’.

Animal studies
All animal experiments were reviewed and approved
by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
RPMI8226 cells (5×106 cells/μl per site) in their
logarithmic growth phase were implanted subcutaneously
into the right flank of 3-4 weeks-old female severe
combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice (Shanghai
Experimental Animal Center ofthe Chinese Academy of
Sciences, Shanghai, China). Tumor volume was measured
and calculated as a previous report. When tumors reached
a volume of 80-100 mm3, mice were randomly assigned to
one of the treatment groups: 5 days of GSK-470 (40 mg/
kg/d), 5 days of PP242 (20 mg/kg/d), or 5 days of GSK470 combined with PP242 as an intraperitoneal injection
once every day. The untreated control group received
DMSO. After 5 days of treatment, one mouse of each
groups were sacrificed, and tumors were harvested for
immunohistochemistry.

MTT colorimetric survival assay
Cell
viability
was
determined
by
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) assay as previously
reported [49]. Drug concentrations required to inhibit
50% of cell growth (IC50) was calculated using nonlinear
regression analysis.

RT-PCR assay
Total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy
Plus kit (TaKaRa Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). cDNA
templates were made from total RNA using reverse
transcriptase kit according to manufacturer’s instructions
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The following
specific primer was used to amplify PTEN: Forward,
5’-GACAGCCATCATCAAAGAGATCG-3’; Backward,
5’-CATGGTGTTTTATCCCTCTTG-3’. The PCR reaction
was performed using Taq polymerase (Promega) for 35
cycles. PCR products staining by ethidium bromide were
fractionated on a 1.5% agarose gel.

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde,
embedded in paraffin, and then cut in 4-mm sections.
Detection of p-mTOR (Ser2448) and p-mTOR (Ser2481)
in primary tumor samples was performed using the
corresponding specific antibodies (Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
Apoptotic cells in tumor samples were assessed by TUNEL
staining with an In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche,
Nutley, NJ, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
All tissue sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.

Detection of apoptosis
Cells (2×105) were seeded and incubated overnight
at 37°C, 5% CO2. Cells were centrifuged at 300g for 5 min
upon treatment with each drug. Cell pellets were collected
and fixed with 70% ethanol on ice for 20 min, followed by
centrifugation. Apoptosis were quantified by staining cells
with annexin V-FITC and propidium iodide (PI) using
annexin V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen,
San Diego, CA, USA). The samples were analyzed by
flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD).

The CI analysis was based on the methods of Chou
and colleagues [51]. The synergy of GSK-470 with PP242
was analyzed with the use of CalcuSyn software (Biosoft,
Cambridge, UK). The values of tumor volume were
expressed as mean ± SD. The difference between groups
was analyzed by ANOVA and Student’s t-test. P < 0.05
was considered to be significant.
