ABSTRACT:
As published recently in Cancer Cell, p53 impairs the apoptotic response to
chemotherapy and clinical outcome in breast cancer. I discuss that, while treating
tumors lacking wt p53, this phenomenon can be exploited to protect normal cells
from chemotherapy because all normal cells have wt p53. Also, several therapeutic
paradigms can be reassessed, including the role of cellular senescence in cancer
therapy.

Background information

A). Yet, the selectivity is difficult to achieve by using one
drug. To do so, Doxorubicin should arrest normal cells
without permanently damaging them. Therefore, doses
of Doxorubicin should be low, just sufficient to induce
p53 in normal cells. But at such doses, the damage may
be not sufficient to cause mitotic catastrophe in most (or
any) cancer cells. If the dose is increased, there will be
harm to normal cells. Doxorubicin cannot protect and kill
efficiently at the same dose.
The solution is to use two drugs (Fig. 1B): the first
drug will induce p53 and the second drug will cause
catastrophe during mitosis [2, 3]. Then, as Russian
proverb goes, both “the wolves are sated, and the sheep
are intact.” Low doses of Doxorubicin, which arrest cells
with wt p53, do not arrest cells lacking wt p53. Cells
lacking wt p53 enter mitosis. If such cells are treated with
mitotic inhibitors (MI), then they, for sure, undergo mitotic
catastrophe. In apoptosis-prone cells, this culminates in
apoptosis (see appendix, footnote 2).
As a p53-inducing drug, Doxorubicin can be
substituted with low doses of etoposide, actinomycin D
and leptomycin. In cell culture, these agents protected
normal cells as well as cancer cells with wt p53 from
mitotic inhibitors (MI) such as paclitaxel, docetaxel,
vinblastine and nocodazole as well as inhibitors of mitotic
kinases [2-10]. Especially Actinomycin D could be used
at extremely low concentrations [6, 8].Still, even at low
doses, DNA-damaging p53-inducing drugs may be viewed
as too damaging. Also, they may arrest certain types of
cancer cells by p53-independent mechanism, requiring
the inclusion of Chk1 inhibitors in the combination
[11]. DNA damaging drugs can be substituted by Mdm2

By demonstrating that p53-mediated senescence
impairs the apoptotic response to doxorubicin (Dox), a
DNA damaging and p53-inducing drug, Lozano and coauthors suggest the reassessment of the paradigm for p53
in cancer therapy [1]. Taking up this invitation, I will
discuss how to spare normal cells from chemotherapy,
while eliminating cancer cells lacking wt p53.
In cell culture, any cancer cell can be killed by
chemotherapy. But chemotherapy poorly discriminates
cancer and normal cells. It damages both types of cells.
Side effects limit the therapy, precluding the elimination of
cancer cells(see appendix footnote 1). If we could protect
vital normal tissues from chemotherapy without protecting
cancer cells, then we could cure cancer.
Although this topic is not addressed by Lozano and
co-workers, the paper hints on the solution. As described,
doxorubicin-treated p53 mutant tumors failed to arrest
proliferation, leading to abnormal mitoses and cell death,
whereas p53 wild-type tumors arrested, avoiding mitotic
catastrophe and cell death [1]. In tumors lacking p53, this
can be exploited for selective protection of normal cells
from chemotherapy. Let us see how.

From drug to drug combination
Since all normal cells have wt p53, its induction
by Doxorubicin can in theory protect normal cells from
the cytotoxicity of Doxorubicin itself. In contrast, tumor
cells with mutant p53 will be selectively killed (Fig. 1

inhibitors such as nutlin-3a and MI-219, which induce p53,
without DNA damage [12-15]. Mdm2 inhibitors can be
used for protection of normal cells during chemotherapy
of tumors lacking p53. Nutlin-3a selectively protects cells
with wt p53 [7, 10, 16-18]. In animals, Mdm2 inhibitors
do not have dose-limiting side effects [14, 19, 20]. And
most importantly, nutlin-3a decreases side effects of
chemotherapy in mice [20]. The main disadvantage of
Mdm2-inhibtors is that they are not approved yet for
clinical use. Nutlin-3a analogs are undergoing clinical
trials as anti-cancer drugs not as protective agents. They
may (or may not) fail as anticancer drugs. But their
utility, as protective drugs, is valuable. P53 may cause
senescence and reversible quiescence [21-28]. A brief
treatment with Nutlin-3a induces reversible arrest in most
normal cells [29, 30] (see appendix, footnote 3). Still, to
avoid senescence caused by nutlin-3a in some cell types,
rapamyin can be added to the drug combination (Fig. 1C).
Not only does rapamycin suppress the conversion from
reversible arrest to senescence [22, 31] but it also can
protect normal cells from chemotherapy [17, 32]. When
normal cells are firmly protected, then additional drugs
can be added to the combination to increase apoptosis in
cancer cells (Fig. 1C). For example, cancer cells arrested
in mitosis by MI become extremely sensitive to TNF and
TRAIL. During mitosis, transcription is inhibited and this
sensitizes cells to TNF and TRAIL. When transcription
is inhibited, TNF can induce apoptosis even in the most
apoptosis-reluctant cells [33], a goal of cancer therapy
(see the next section). An example of cyclotherapeutic
combination (footnote 4) containing 4 drugs is: nutlin-3a
+ rapamycin followed by paclitaxel + TRAIL.
Furthermore, the strategy to protect normal cells is
not limited to targeting wt p53 (or loss of p53). It may
involve other targets present or absent in cancer cells
[34, 35]. For example, Rb is often lost in human cancer,
rendering cells resistant to arrest caused by CDK4/6
inhibitors [36]. Yet, CDK4/6 inhibitors arrest normal cells.
Therefore, co-administration of PD0332991 (a CDK4/6
inhibitor) plus carboplatin provided protection of bone
marrow, without protection of Rb-deficient tumors [37].
Similarly, administration of PD0332991 to mice reduced
treatment toxicity of radiation without compromising
the therapeutic tumor response [38, 39]. Loss of Rb
and p53 coincided in the most aggressive cancers [40,
41], rendering them a perfect target for cyclotherapy.
Also, fasting can selectively protect normal cells from
chemotherapy and decrease side effects in patients [4245]. Among other effects, fasting inhibits the nutrientsensing mTOR pathway [46]. Noteworthy, a combination
of rapamycin and metformin protected normal cells from
MI [17]. Furthermore, the combination of a protective
drug (a substrate of Pgp/MRP) plus a cytotoxic drug (not
a substrate) selectively kills multidrug resistant cancer
cells, while sparing non-resistant cells [4, 47-49]. Finally,
there are several other strategies of selective protection of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

normal cells [50-58].

Combining letters in words, words in phrases
It is difficult enough to treat cancer. Why should
this be done in the hardest way: by using a single drug
and scrambled combinations, instead of cyclotherapeutic
and other ordered combinations? In analogy, it is difficult
to write poems like Pushkin, for instance, but absolutely
impossible to write them by using one letter. By using at
least 2 “letters”, we can increase a therapeutic window.
And by using 4 or 5, one can design effective and selective
therapy. Still, p53-dependent cyclotherapy will eliminate
cells with mutant p53 while sparing cancer cells with wt
p53, thus selecting for wt p53 tumors. And such therapy
cannot be used against wt p53 cancers to start with. Of
course ordered combinations are not limited to targeting
p53 [34, 35, 48].
One general solution is alternating supercombinations: ordered (cyclotherapeutic) combinations
can be alternated with other modalities such as
conventional therapy, cancer- and tissue- selective drugs
[59-63]. For example, nutlin-3 is cytotoxic to cancer cells
with wt p53 [19, 64, 65]. While causing response, nutlin3a (as any drug) will select for drug (nutlin) resistance.
In fact, nutlin-3a selects for mutant p53 [66]. Then the
therapy with nutlin-3a can be followed by cyclotherapeutic
combination. This alternating strategy was recently
discussed in detail. Like letters (drugs) can be combined in
words (ordered combinations), the words can be combined
in phrases.

Cell senescence is not first choice
An important point to reassess is whether
senescence is a goal of cancer therapy. Fifteen years
ago, it was accepted that it is apoptosis that is a goal [6770]. In fact, chemotherapy induces apoptosis in curable
malignancies such as leukemia, lymphoma and childhood
cancers. Unfortunately, most common cancers are
apoptosis-reluctant. In most common cancers, apoptosis
is not a predictive marker of the therapeutic response.
However, one may argue that these cancers are poorly
curable exactly because chemotherapy does not induce
apoptosis. So it is not that apoptosis is not a goal, simply
it is not easily achievable in the majority of cancers.
(Note: Still certain drug combinations cause apoptosis in
the most apoptosis-reluctant cells. These combinations
could be used when normal cells are protected as shown
in figure 1C). In apoptosis-reluctant cells, standard
chemotherapy cause either slow cell death or senescence
(at low drug concentrations). Therefore, it was suggested
that senescence is a feasible goal [71, 72], perhaps
because it can by induced in common cancers by almost
any cytostatic drug. Conventional anti-cancer drugs at
603

low concentrations all induce senescence in cell culture
but do not cure cancer patients. Either they do not induce
senescence in the organism or senescence is not sufficient
or both.
The paper by Jackson et al demonstrated that
senescence is not effective, whereas apoptosis is effective
[1]. Furthermore, a senescent phenotype including hypersecretory and pro-inflammatory features seems to be
counter-productive [1], in agreement with an existing
paradigm [71, 73]. Senescence is a form of cell-cycle
arrest, when oncogenic and growth-promoting pathways
are still active [74]. Whereas cell-cycle arrest is a barrier
to cancer growth (by definition), a senescent phenotype
(due to over-activation of growth-promoting pathways in
arrested cells) is not [74]. Two therapeutic approaches can
be suggested. First, senescent cells can be further targeted
[75]. Second, rapamycin can partially suppress the
senescent phenotype without abrogating cell cycle arrest
[31]. If the senescent phenotype is not of any importance
for anti-cancer therapy, co-treatment with rapamycin will
not prevent antitumor effect of doxorubicin. This could be
tested in the Lozano model [1]. Noteworthy, rapamycin
can be employed to prevent senescence of normal cells
(Fig. 1C) and cancer cells. And the same modalities
(rapamycin, metformin, nutlin-3a, fasting) can be used for
protection of normal cells and for cancer prevention [7680]. And calorie restriction and rapamycin extend lifespan
in diverse species [81-83]. This may be not a co-incidence.
But this is a topic for another article.

mTOR, nutlin-3a by itself can suppress senescence, thus causing
reversible arrest instead [21-23].
Footnote 4: Cyclotherapeutic and other ordered combinations are antagonistic in normal cells [97]. So far, cyclotherapeutic combinations were not tested in the clinic, albeit drugs that
could be used in cyclotherapetic combinations are used in conventional (scrambled) combinations. In conventional (scrambled) combinations, each drug is intended to damage cells, not to
selectively protect normal cells. Drugs are combined for synergy
usually at full doses, thus increasing side effects. In contrast
in cyclotherapeutic (ordered) combinations, the choice of drugs,
doses and sequences are the key.

Footnote 1: In cancer patients only a few types of cancer are

curable by chemotherapy alone. Curable cancers arise from tissues prone to apoptosis such as lymphoid, testicular, embryonic
and placental/endometrial. For example, testicular germ cell tumors with wt p53 are very sensitive to p53-inducing chemotherapy [84, 85]. Following therapy, relapsed tumors often lack wt
p53 and are resistant to therapy [86-88]. Most common (agingrelated) cancers such as breast, prostate, colon, gastric, thyroid,
pancreatic, lung are hardly curable by chemotherapy, because
they are not more sensitive to chemotherapy than normal cells
are. In such cases, chemotherapy cannot eliminate cancer cells,
without destroying normal cells of vital tissues.
Footnote 2: Cells can be apoptosis-prone and apoptosis-reluctant [89], which in part determines cell fate following mitotic
arrest [90]. These effects varied dramatically depending on the
drug and cell line [91]. In general, p53 is not a marker of resistance to therapy because apoptosis-prone tumors tend to lose
p53 (to avoid apoptosis), whereas apoptosis-reluctant cancers
may retain wt p53 [92].
Footnote 3: The choice between quiescence and senescence
is determined in part by the activity of the nutrient-sensing,
growth-promoting mTOR pathway [24-28, 93-96]. When the
cell cycle is arrested (by any means) but growth-promoting pathways are not, then cells become senescent. Rapamycin decelerates geroconversion (the conversion from reversible arrest to
senescence) [22, 31]. By inhibiting gerogenic pathways such as
