ABSTRACT
Chemoresistance represents a major challenge for treatment of acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Thus, new drugs to overcome chemoresistance in ALL
are urgently needed. To this end, we established a cytarabine (araC)-resistant ALL cell
line (NALM-6/R), which interestingly displayed cross-resistance towards doxorubicin
(ADM). Here we report that low dose of triptolide (TPL), a natural product used
for treating inflammatory diseases such as arthritis, could reverse araC and ADM
resistance and in NALM-6/R cells as well as primary cells from patients with relapsed
or refractory (R/R) ALL, reflected by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of
apoptosis in vitro, and repression of tumor growth in vivo in a mouse xenograft model.
Mechanistically, these events were associated with impaired mitochondrial membrane
potential and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Co-treatment
with TPL and araC or ADM upregulated pro-apoptotic caspase-9 protein, inhibited
checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) and 2 (Chk2) phosphorylation, and induced fH2A.X (a
DNA damage marker). Notably, the combination regimen of TPL and conventional
chemotherapeutics also rapidly diminished tumor burden in a patient with R/R ALL.
Together, these findings provide preclinical evidence for repurposing use of TPL in
combination with chemotherapeutic agents to treat R/R ALL as an alternative salvage
regimen.

of patients with relapsed or refractory (R/R) adult ALL
remains very poor. Whereas disease-free survival and
complete remission of these patients are rare after salvage
therapy, most of them die from the original disease [4].
Current chemotherapy for treating ALL involves complex
regimens of multiple drugs that are carefully molded in
order to eliminate minimal residual disease while spare
normal hematopoiesis. However, de novo and acquired
multidrug resistance of ALL cells represents the major
barrier to the success of chemotherapy. Therefore,

INTRODUCTION
Although the remission rate has achieved > 80% in
patients with newly-diagnosed adult acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) with standard induction regimens, a
majority of the responding patients eventually become
refractory to initial therapy [1, 2]. 30-60% of these patients
experience a relapse, despite aggressive chemotherapy
regimens for consolidation and maintenance, even after
allogeneic stem cell transplantation [3]. The outcome

Interestingly, NALM-6/R cells displayed marked
cross-resistance towards ADM, with the IC50 of ADM
in NALM-6/R cells (4.82 ± 0.97 μM) about 43 folds
higher than that in parental NALM-6 cells (0.11 ± 0.03
μM; p< 0.01). Of note, there was no cross-resistance to
TPL observed in NALM-6/R cells (IC50 = 0.032 ± 0.04
μM vs. 0.035 ± 0.03 μM for parental NALM-6 cells; p>
0.05). These results demonstrate that NALM-6/R cells,
a chemoresistant human ALL cell line established in
vitro, are highly tolerated to cytotoxicity of conventional
chemotherapeutic agents such as araC and ADM.

discovery and development of new drugs to overcome
multidrug resistance is urgently needed in treatment of
R/R ALL patients.
Natural products, particularly those used for a
long time in traditional Chinese medicine, have recently
attracted a lot of attention in treatment of cancer, especially
in reversing multidrug resistance [6]. Triptolide (TPL) is a
diterpenoid epoxide, originally purified from the medicinal
plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F (commonly known
as lei gong teng) whose extracts have been used to treat
a variety of diseases such as inflammation and arthritis
in traditional Chinese medicine. TPL was structurally
characterized in 1972 [5], and has been shown to have
anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, as well as anticancer activity. Recently, several groups including
ours have demonstrated the potential benefit of TPL to
overcome chemoresistance in different types of cancer
[7-9], such as myeloid leukemia, pancreatic and ovarian
cancer. However, the role and underlying mechanism of
TPL in reversing chemoresistance in ALL have not been
explored yet.
In the present study, we first established an araCresistant ALL cell line (NALM-6/R) by exposure of
parental drug-naïve NALM-6 cells to stepwise increasing
concentrations of cytarabine (araC), which also displayed
cross-resistance towards doxorubicin (ADM). We then
found that low dose TPL was able to re-sensitize NALM6/R cells to araC as well as doxorubicin(ADM) in vitro
and in vivo, in association with production of reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of checkpoint
kinase 1 (Chk1) and 2 (Chk2), resulting in DNA damage,
mitochondrial injury, and apoptosis. The regimens
combining TPL with araC or ADM were highly active
against primary cells obtained from patients with R/R
ALL. Of note, we also observed that treatment with TPL
with conventional chemotherapeutics also rapidly reduced
tumor burden in a patient with R/R ALL, without notable
toxicity.

Low dose TPL enhances cytotoxicity of araC and
ADM in NALM-6/R cells
The inhibitory effect of TPL, araC and ADM as
single agent on growth of NALM-6/R cells was first
examined. Neither araC within a concentration range
of 0-5 μM nor ADM within a concentration range of
0-0.5 μM exhibited significant proliferation inhibition in
NALM-6/R cells after 48h exposure (Figure 1). However,
in the presence of the IC20 concentration (i.e., 10 nM) of
TPL, the IC50 of araC and ADM against NALM-6/R cells
were reduced by 20 and 15 times, respectively (Table 2
and Figure 1). These results suggest that low dose TPL
might be capable to reverse chemoresistance against araC
and ADM in ALL cells.

TPL potentiates araC- or ADM-induced
apoptosis in both NALM-6/R cells and primary
refractory or relapsed ALL cells
We then investigated whether the synergistic antitumor effects between triptolide and araC or ADM stem
from induction of apoptosis in chemoresistant ALL
cells. To this end, NALM-6/R cells were exposed to the
highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of araC (5 μM) or
ADM (0.5 μM) in the presence or absence of low dose
(IC20 concentration, 10 nM) TPL for 48 h. Notably, coadministration of low dose TPL significantly increased
apoptosis induced by araC or ADM from 10.21 ± 0.07%
and 5.56 ± 0.04% to 52.40 ± 4.45% and 24.60 ± 3.23%
(P < 0.01 for each case; Figure 2a and 2b), respectively.
Consistently, combined treatment with 10 nM TPL and
sub-toxic concentrations of araC or ADM significantly
increased apoptosis in primary cells isolated from R/R
ALL patients (n = 12; P < 0.01 for each case, compared
araC or ADM as single agent; Figure 2c and Table 3).
Notably, the regimens combining TPL with araC or ADM
were more effective to induce apoptosis in primary R/R
B-ALL cells from patients with white blood cell counts >
100 x 109/L than those with < 100 x 109/L (P < 0.05; Table
4). These findings suggest that TPL might re-sensitize
chemoresistant ALL cells to araC or ADM.

RESULTS
Establishment of a human ALL cell line acquired
chemoresistance
We first established a drug-resistant cell line
(designated NALM-6/R) by exposure of the human ALL
NALM-6 cells to stepwise increasing concentrations of
araC, after which the established NALM-6/R cell line
was routinely maintained in the medium containing 5
μM araC. The chemoresistant profile was evaluated by
examine cytotoxicity of araC and other conventional
anti-leukemia agents in vitro in parental drug-naïve
NALM-6 and -resistant NALM-6/R cells. As shown
in Table 1, the IC50 of araC against NALM-6/R cells
(115.00 ± 23.12 μM) was 766 folds higher than that

The combination of araC or ADM with
TPL triggers reactive oxygen species (ROS)
production and induces mitochondrial injury in
ALL cells

H2A.X (designated γH2A.X) at the sites of DNA doublestrand break [13]. As γH2A.X is commonly used as a
marker for DNA damage, we next examined expression
of γH2A.X to monitor the effects of TPL on DNA damage
induced by araC or ADM. While TPL did not significantly
affected the levels of γH2A.X, the combination of TPL
with araC or ADM at the indicated doses resulted in a
rightward shift of γH2A.X-FITC fluorescent peak in FACS
histograms, indicating increased γH2A.X expression
(Figure 5).
Further, Western blot was performed to assess
the effects of TPL and araC or ADM alone or in
combination on DNA damage checkpoint by monitoring
phosphorylation of Chk1 (Ser345) and Chk2 (Thr68),
which reflects cytoprotective activation of cell cycle
checkpoints in response to DNA damage (e.g., induced by
DNA-damaging agents, including araC and ADM) [14].
Notably, co-treatment with TPL markedly diminished
phosphorylation of Chk1 and/or Chk2 triggered by araC
and ADM, accompanied by a robust increase in γH2A.X
expression (Figure 6), consistent with the results of flow
cytometric analysis (Figure 5), and cleavage/activation of
caspase 9. These findings suggest that disruption of DNA
damage checkpoint might also contribute to reversal of
chemoresistance by TPL in ALL cells.

Since mitochondria play a crucial role in regulation
of apoptosis, apoptosis is often associated with loss of
mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) [10]. In this
context, we then examine the effects of TPL and araC
or ADM alone or in combination on MMP. As shown in
Figure 3, whereas exposure to araC (5 μM) or ADM (0.5
μM) resulted in a modest decrease in JC-1 aggregates, coadministration of 10 nM TPL with either of these agents
sharply reduced JC-1 aggregates (Figure 3a), reflecting
loss of MMP (or mitochondrial depolarization), in NALM6/R cells (Figure 3b, P < 0.001 compared to each agent
alone).
Moreover, considering the important role of ROS
in depolarizing mitochondria and inducing apoptosis,
we further measured the ROS levels in NALM-6/R cells
after exposed to araC (5 μM) or ADM (0.5 μM) ± 10 nM
TPL for 12h. Compared to treatment with each single
agent, the combination of TPL with either araC or ADM
significantly increased ROS generation by approximately
9 and 5 folds in NALM-6/R cells, respectively. Notably,
2h pre-treatment with the ROS scavenger NAC (30 mM)
dramatically prevented ROS production induced by TPL
plus araC or ADM (Figure 4), resulting in a marked
reduction in apoptosis (from 52.40 ± 4.45% and 24.60 ±
3.23% to 24.56 ± 3.17% and 14.15 ± 2.41%, respectively)
in NALM-6/R cells (Figure 2b, P < 0.001). These findings
indicate that TPL potentiates lethality of araC and ADM
in chemoresistant ALL cells likely by inducing ROS
generation and mitochondrial injury.

The regimen combining TPL and araC is active
in vivo in a xenograft mouse model generated
from chemoresistant ALL cells
To validate the anti-leukemia activity of the
regimen combining TPL and araC in vivo, we established
a xenograft mouse model by intravenous injection with
chemoresistant NALM-6/R cells into NSI (NOD-SCIDIL2Rg-/-) mice. Of note, mice treated with TPL plus
araC showed a substantial reduction of tumor burden,
manifested by a marked decrease inCD45/CD19 doublepositive cells in bone marrow, compared to mice receiving
each single agent (Figure 7a). Consistently, histopathology
revealed a remarkable reduction of leukemia cell
infiltration in bone marrow of mice receiving treatment
with TPL plus araC (Figure 7b). Further, average spleen
weight of mice treated with TPL plus araC (0.17 ± 0.26 g)

were significantly lower than those of mice in the control
group (0.31 ± 0.23 g), as well as each single agent group
(0.28 ± 0.01g for TPL alone and 0.33 ± 0.56 g for araC
alone; P <0.0001 for each case; Figure 7c). Last, KaplanMeier analysis showed that the combination of TPL with
araC significantly prolonged animal survival, compared to
TPL or araC alone (P < 0.01, Figure 7d).

86%, respectively) were detected on the smears of both
peripheral blood (PB) and bone marrow (BM) aspirate;
other laboratory tests included a basic metabolic panel,
liver and coagulopathy panels, and renal function, which
were all unremarkable. Considering the refractory status
of the disease together with the results of the clinical
tests, TPL in combination with the FA (fludarabine and
cytarabine) regimen was then administered as salvage
chemotherapy. The dose level of TPL was 100 μg/m2
administered in 3 divided doses daily for 7 days, which
was routinely used in clinic for treatment of rheumatoid
arthritis [15]. TPL-related hematological or extrahematological toxicities, including the most serious side
effects of TPL such as renal toxicity, were not observed
during the course of treatment. Surprisingly, the patient
experienced marked hematological improvement with
an 80% reduction of peripheral blood blasts two weeks
after treatment, and complete resolution of bone pain
and fatigue. However, the prolonged response to TPLassociated treatment remains to be defined.

The combined therapy with TPL and
chemotherapeutics rapidly reduces tumor
burden in a patient with refractory B-ALL
Finally, we report the first use of TPL in combination
with conventional chemotherapeutic agents to treat one
patient with refractory ALL (patient #2, Table 3), who had
no other treatment available when enrolled into this study.
This pilot study was conducted with an approval from the
Departmental Review Board and the patent’s informed
consent. Data was collected prospectively. The patient
was a 65-year-old female diagnosed with pre B-ALL with
complex chromosome abnormalities. Even though two
courses of induction chemotherapy including VDCLP and
hyper-CVAD/A regimens were administrated, the response
assessments unfortunately indicated a minor remission. At
enrollment, the patient suffered from severe bone pain and
fatigue; the complete blood count (CBC) revealed WBC
count of 145×109/L; a high percentage of blasts (60 and

DISCUSSION
Development of salvage regimens for adult patients
with ALL has focused on the incorporation of alternative
agents with their known roles in this disease. Most of the
recently developed regimens involve the use of high-doses

of araC in combination with various other agents [1619]. However, efficacy of these regimens is significantly
hampered by acquired drug-resistance to araC. Therefore,
reversal of araC resistance might improve the clinical
outcomes of ALL. To this end, we established an araCresistant ALL cell line (NALM-6/R), which unexpectedly
was also cross-resistant to ADM. Of note, low dose TPL
(10 nM) was able to increase the sensitivity of NALM-6/R
cells to araC and ADM by 20 and 15 times, respectively.
Further, low dose TPL also significantly increased
apoptosis induced by araC and ADM in NALM-6/R cells.
We further established a xenograft mouse model using
these araC-resistant NALM-6/R cells, in which low dose
TPL plus araC was also highly active in vivo, reflected by
marked reduction of tumor burden and prolonged animal
survival.
Importantly, low dose TPL also dramatically
enhanced lethality of araC or ADM in primary leukemia
blasts isolated from patients with R/RALL despite the
cytogenetic subtypes. It is well established that disease
burden at time of relapse is one of the most important
prognostic factors of R/R ALL [4]. Interestingly,
combined treatment with TPL and araC or ADM induced
higher percentage of apoptosis in blasts of patients with
WBC count > 100×109/L, than those with < 100×109/L,
suggesting that this combination regimen might overcome
the unfavorable effects of high tumor burden. However,
further studies including more cases are needed to confirm
this finding. Notably, after received the combination
therapy of TPL with conventional chemotherapeutics, a
patient with refractory ALL, who had no other treatment
available, experienced hematological improvement
with 80% reduction of peripheral blood blasts two
weeks later. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo
findings argue strongly that low dose TPL might resensitize chemoresistant ALL cells to conventional
chemotherapeutic agents (e.g., araC and ADM), and
thereby improve the outcome of patients with R/R ALL.
Chemotherapy represents a plethora of challenges
to chromosomal DNA. Whereas DNA damage caused by
various stimuli has been known to increase ROS levels
[20], ROS can in turn induce a wide array of damages to
DNA, therefore forming a positive feedback loop. DNA
damage-induced ROS is important for determination
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

of cell death versus survival [21]. The ability of cancer
cells to distinguish ROS as a pro-survival from a proapoptotic signal is dependent on the amount of ROS.
While modest levels of ROS are required for cancer cells
to survive, excessive ROS production is lethal to them.
It has been reported that drug-resistant cells often have
relatively higher basal levels of intrinsic oxidative stress,
which might thus lower their threshold to lethal actions of
ROS [22]. In the present study, we found that combined
treatment with TPL and araC or ADM not only markedly
increased ROS production, but also induced robust DNA
damage in chemoresistantNALM-6/R cells. Moreover,
pre-treatment with the antioxidant NAC attenuated ROS
generation triggered by TPL plus araC or ADM, resulting
in blockade of apoptosis, suggesting the functional role
of elevated ROS levels in reversal of chemoresistance
by TPL. Triptolide has previously been demonstrated to
induce apoptosis by regulating members of the caspase
family, in association with loss of MMP and activation
of caspases in cancer cells [23, 24]. Notably, combined
treatment with TPL and araC or ADM led to loss of
MMP as well as cleavage/activation of caspase-9. Taken
together, these findings argue that TPL in combination
with araC or ADM triggers ROS production and induces
DNA damage, cooperatively leading to activation of the
mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptosis pathway.
Virtually all DNA-damaging agents currently used
in cancer treatment induce apoptosis of cancer cells by
inducing substantial DNA damage. It is well established
that efficient and continual DNA repair is crucial for
normal cells to survive, while it also represents an
important mechanism for chemoresistance of tumor
cells. Thus, defects or disruption of the DNA damage
response (DDR), including DNA damage checkpoint
and repair pathways, could sensitize cancer cells to
genotoxic agents. For example, the Chk1 inhibitor
7-Hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) has been shown to
potentiate anti-tumor activity of the DNA-damaging
agents such as gemcitabine and cytarabine [25]. DNA
cross-linking agents activate checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1)
and 2 (Chk2), which are essential transducer of the DDR
[14], which protect cells from lethal effects of genotoxic
stress induced by these agents. In the present study, it
was found that co-administration of TPL significantly

inhibited phosphorylation/activation of Chk1 and Chk2
induced by araC or ADM, accompanied by robust DNA
damage and apoptosis. These results are consistent with
a recent finding that TPL potentiates cisplatin-induced
apoptosis by inhibiting DNA repair in lung cancer cells
[26].
In summary, the present study demonstrates that
low dose TPL could reverse chemoresistance of ALL
cells to conventional DNA-damaging agents (e.g., araCand ADM), at least in part through induction of ROS,
disruption of the DDR, and increase of DNA damage. It
also provides the preclinical and pilot clinical evidence
suggesting that the potential clinical benefits of adding
TPL into standard DNA-damaging agents-based
chemotherapy regimens warrant attention in treatment of
relapsed and refractory ALL patients.

cultured in RPMI-1640 supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum. The acquisition of human bone marrow
samples were approved by the local institutes and the
experimental use of human specimens was carried out
in accordance with the institutional guidelines and the
Declaration of Helsinki. Acquisition of bone marrow
samples was performed with the informed consent of
patients.

In vitro cell proliferation assay
NALM-6/R cells were cultured in 96-well culture
plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in a medium
containing different concentrations of araC, ADM, or
combinations of these agents with fixed concentrations
of TPL (IC20: 10 nM for 48 h) at 37°C in a humidified 5%
CO2-95% air incubator. Cell inhibition was determined
by a CCK8 assay, according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (Beyotime Company, China). After 48 h,
the cells were incubated in a 10 μl CCK-8 solution for 2
h at 37°C. The absorbance of each well was quantified
at 450 nm with an automated ELESA reader. IC50
values were obtained using the logit method, and were
determined from the results of at least 3 independent
tests. The inhibition rate was calculated based on the
following formula: Inhibition rate (%) = (1 - absorbance
of experimental group/absorbance of control group) x
100%.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and reagents
Triptolide (TPL, C20H24O6, MW: 360.40),
cytarabine (araC, C9H13N3O5, MW: 243.22), doxorubicin
(ADM, C27H29NO11, MW: 543.52), and N-acetyl-Lcysteine (NAC) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). TPL was dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (Sigma-Aldrich, Dorset, UK) as a 100 μM
stock solution, and was freshly diluted in culture
medium before use. Cytarabine, doxorubicin, were
dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as a 100
mM stock solution at -20°C. Light exposure was kept to
a minimum for all drugs used.

Flow cytometric assays for cell apoptosis,
mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive
oxygen species and γH2A.X detection
After treated for 48 h, 2 x 105 NALM-6/R cells
were subjected to apoptosis assay using an Annexin V
Apoptosis Detection Kit-APC (eBioscience Company,
USA), following the manufacturer’s instructions. For
the mitochondrial membrane potential assessment,
after different treatments for 48 h, 2 x 105 NALM6/R cells were analyzed using a JC-1 fluorescent
probe kit (Beyotime Company, China), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. To measure the intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, about 2 x 105
NALM/R cells subjected to different treatments were
washed in PBS buffer twice, and then incubated in 1 ml
of serum-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 μM of
H2DCFDA for 30 min at 37°C. The cells were harvested,
and then washed in serum-free RPMI 1640 medium buffer
twice to remove the remaining H2DCFDA. The fluorescent
intensity was measured by flow cytometry. For assessing
the degree of DNA damage, 2 x 105 NALM-6/R cells
were incubated for 15 min on ice in hybridization buffer
(PBS containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and
0.25% Triton X-100). After centrifugation, the cells were
incubated with rabbit monoclonal anti-γH2A.X antibody

Cell culture and patient samples
NALM-6 cells were obtained from the Institute
of Hematology and Blood Diseases Hospital, Chinese
Academy of Medical Sciences (Tianjin, China). The
cells were routinely cultured in a RPMI 1640 medium
(Invitrogen, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator under
standard conditions. AraC-resistant cells were established
from the parental NALM-6 cells in our laboratory
by continuous exposure to araC at low but gradually
increasing concentrations, as described previously [27].
Finally, NALM-6/R cells were maintained in complete
medium containing 5 μM of araC.
Relapsed or refractory acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (R/R ALL) cases were defined according to the
classification in the NCCN guidelines. Twelve cases of
R/R ALL bone marrow or peripheral blood samples were
obtained from the Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical
University. Major patient characteristics are summarized
in Table 3. Mononuclear cells were isolated by standard
Ficoll-Hypaque density centrifugation, and then

comparisons were performed using the One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) followed by the Bonferroni posthoc
test. Survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier
analysis and compared using the log-rank test. P values
< 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS 20.0 software (La

(Cell Signaling Technology, USA) for 1 h, then washed
with PBS and incubated with an FITC-conjugated mouse
anti-rabbit IgG antibody (BD Pharmingen) for 30 min in
the dark at room temperature.

Western blot analysis
The cytoplasmic protein (50 μg/lane) from each
sample was loaded onto a 10% SDS-PAGE gel, then
transferred to a PVDF membrane (Millipore, Billerica,
MA, USA) and blotted with the appropriate antibodies.
Non-specific binding was avoided by blocking the
PVDF membrane with 5% skimmed milk in TBS-T for
1 h. The 5% skimmed milk in TBS-T was also used to
dilute primary antibodies (phospho-γ-H2AX, rabbit
mAb,1: 1000, CST; Phospho-Chk1 (Ser345) Rabbit mAb,
detecting Chk1 phosphorylated at serine 345,1: 1000,
CST; Phospho-Chk2 (Thr68) Rabbit mAb, detecting Chk2
phosphorylated at Thr68,1: 1000, CST; caspase-9, mouse
mAb, 1: 1000, CST) and HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (1: 10000; CST). The membranes were incubated
in the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C and in the
secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. The
quantities of protein loaded were verified by staining the
same membranes with anti-β-actin antibody (rabbit mAb
1: 1000, CST). The signals were detected on X-ray films
using an enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting
detection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). β-Actin was
included as a loading control.

All animal experiments were performed in the
Laboratory Animal Center of the Guangzhou Institute
of Biomedicine and Health (GIBH), and the animal
procedures were approved by the Animal Welfare
Committee of GIBH. To generate a mouse model of
araC-resistant ALL, we subcutaneously injected NALM6/R cells (5 × 105) into the angular veins of sublethally
irradiated adult NSI (NOD/SCID IL2rg-/-) mice (20-30 g
body weight; 2-3 months of age). Ten days later, 16 tumorbearing mice were divided into 4 groups and injected
intraperitoneally with 100 μl with ddH2O, araC (10 mg/
kg, half of maximum tolerated dose in SCID mice [28]),
TPL (0.5 mg/kg, 25% of lethal concentration [29]), or
TPL in combination with araC for 5 days, respectively.
We evaluated the responses to this treatment by measuring
the overall survival times, the weights of the spleens and
the percentages of human CD45/CD19 double-positive
cells in the bone marrow, as assessed by flow cytometry.
The tissue samples were fixed in formaldehyde and further
embedded in paraffin.
