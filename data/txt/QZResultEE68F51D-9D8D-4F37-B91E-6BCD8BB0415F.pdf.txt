BACKGROUND. Today, intensive therapy that includes high-dose melphalan with
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is considered standard therapy in
younger patients with newly diagnosed myeloma. When the current trial was
initiated, combined vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) was the
most commonly used induction therapy before ASCT and yielded rapid major
responses without interfering with stem cell harvest. However, the administration
of VAD demands a central venous access, and well-described toxicities are associated with the therapy. This randomized trial, which was initiated in 2001 by the
Nordic Myeloma Study Group, was an attempt to bring a larger portion of
patients to ASCT more quickly.

T

oday, intensive therapy, including high-dose melphalan followed by autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT), is considered standard therapy for
patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
aged <65 years.1 Usually, treatment starts with combined chemotherapy with the objective of reducing
the number of tumor cells before stem cell mobilization. Combined vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD) (ie, vincristine and doxorubicin
given as a continuous infusion for 4 days combined
with pulses of dexamethasone2) has been one of the
most frequently used initial treatments. However, the
contribution of vincristine and doxorubicin in tumor
burden reduction for patients with myeloma is disputed, and both drugs potentially are toxic. In addition, the administration of VAD demands a central
venous access with the accompanying risks of catheter-related complications.
In a previous Nordic Myeloma Study Group
(NMSG) study (NMSG 5/94)3 in which newly diagnosed patients aged <60 years received intensive
therapy, 15% of patients did not undergo ASCT
because of disease progression before they reached
ASCT and/or because of treatment-related mortality
or morbidity during the initial VAD therapy. Therefore, the current study was designed to investigate
whether a simplified initial therapy could be administered to speed up the treatment process and
increase the fraction of patients who underwent
ASCT without loss of efficacy. In a multicenter,
prospective, randomized study setting, conventional initial therapy, which consisted of 3 courses
of VAD, was compared with 2 courses of bolusdose cyclophosphamide and pulse-dose dexamethasone (Cy-Dex). After these courses, all patients
followed the same treatment schedule, including
stem cell mobilization and harvest followed by
ASCT. The primary endpoint was the proportion
of patients receiving ASCT. Secondary endpoints
were response rate, event-free survival, and overall
survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Fourteen centers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden,
covering a total population of approximately 14 million inhabitants, participated in the study. Between
November 2001 and October 2003, 314 patients with
newly diagnosed, treatment-demanding multiple myeloma were entered in the study. These patients represented approximately 65% of the expected number
of newly diagnosed patients age <65 years during

this period in the study area based on an estimated
yearly incidence of 1.8 per 100 000 inhabitants.
All patients signed a written informed consent
before inclusion. The study was approved by ethical
committees in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden and
was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975.

Methods
Diagnostic criteria
The NMSG diagnostic criteria described previously3
were used.
Response criteria
A complete response (CR) was defined by the disappearance of M-protein from serum and urine in agarose gel electrophoresis and <5% plasma cells in a
bone marrow aspirate. A partial response (PR) was
defined by a reduction 50% in the initial serum Mprotein concentration and a reduction of BenceJones proteinuria to <0.2 g/24 hours. A minor
response (MR) was defined by a reduction from 25%
to 50% of the initial serum M-protein concentration
and a reduction in Bence-Jones proteinuria by at
least 50% but not to 0.2 g/24 hours. To fulfill the criteria for a CR, PR, or MR, the patients were not
allowed to have any other signs of myeloma progression. Progressive disease was defined by a confirmed
increase in the serum M-protein concentration by
>25% from the level at the time of best response
(but at least to 10 g/L), an increase of Bence-Jones
proteinuria to >1 g/24 h, or other unequivocal signs
of disease progression, such as hypercalcemia, progressive skeletal disease, or soft tissue plasmacytomas. No response was defined as a reduction <25%
in M-protein from diagnosis. Progression, death
without progression, and occurrence of a secondary
malignancy all were considered events. Event-free
survival and overall survival were calculated from the
start of therapy.
Treatment
Patients were randomized to receive either 3 courses
of VAD (vincristine at a dose of 1.6 mg/m2 and doxorubicin at a dose of 36 mg/m2 given as a continuous infusion on Days 1–4 and dexamethasone at a
dose of 40 mg per day on Days 1–4, 9–12, and 17–20,
repeated every 4 weeks) or 2 courses of Cy-Dex (cyclophosphamide at a dose of 1000 mg/m2 given as
an intravenous infusion for 1 hour on Day 1 and
dexamethasone at a dose of 40 mg per day on Days
1–4 and 9–12, repeated after 3 weeks). The initial
treatment, for logistical reasons, could be prolonged
with 1 course up to a maximum of 4 courses of VAD

Initial Therapy in Myeloma/Mellqvist et al.

or 3 courses of Cy-Dex. Thereafter, stem cell harvest
was performed within 6 weeks (preferably within 4
weeks) after the last induction course. Mobilization
therapy with cyclophosphamide at a dose of 2 g/m2
was given followed by daily subcutaneous injections
of filgrastim (Neupogen) starting 4 days later. The
optimal time for harvest was chosen by CD34 monitoring. The objective was to collect >5 3 106 CD34positive cells/kg. The minimum amount requested
for ASCT was 2 3 106 CD34-positive cells/kg. Highdose treatment with melphalan 200 mg/m2 was performed within 6 weeks (preferably within 4 weeks)
after stem cell harvest. After ASCT, maintenance
treatment with a interferon was optional.

Follow-up Evaluation
Patients were evaluated with serum and urine electrophoresis after each cycle of initial therapy; before
stem cell mobilization; before ASCT; and 1 month, 2
months, 3 months, and 6 months after ASCT. All
patients were followed with respect to event-free survival for 1 year and, for overall survival, for 2 years
after the last patient was included.
Statistical Analysis
The hypothesis of this study was that initial treatment with Cy-Dex would increase the proportion of
patients who underwent ASCT from 85% to 95%. To
prove this with a power of 80% and a significance
level of 5% (2-sided test), 145 patients were required
in each group. The randomization was stratified for
country and age (<60 years vs >60 years).
The proportions of patients with a given characteristic were compared using the Fisher exact test for
variables with frequency scale and the Wilcoxon
rank-sum test for the remaining variables. Event-free
and overall survival rates were calculated according
to the Kaplan-Meier method, and survival comparisons between groups were made by using the logrank test.

Baseline Characteristics
Baseline characteristics for both treatment groups
are shown in Table 1. No significant differences were
observed between the groups with regard to any of
the variables.

VAD indicates vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone; Cy-Dex, cyclophosphamide plus dexamethasone.
* One patient in the VAD group was given high-dose melphalan instead of cyclophosphamide before
stem cell harvest, and 1 patient in the Cy-Dex group died before the initiation of treatment.

Completion of ASCT
ASCT was performed in 134 of 156 patients (86%) in
the VAD group and in 137 of 158 patients (87%) in
the Cy-Dex group (P value, nonsignificant). The reasons for not undergoing ASCT are listed in Table 2.

The mortality rates for the first 4 months after the
start of treatment were 5.8% (9 of 156 patients) in
the VAD group and 1.9% (3 of 158 patients) in the
Cy-Dex group. The difference was not statistically
significant (P 5 .08).

Toxicity
Episodes of toxicity grade 3 (according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria
version 3.0) are reported in Table 3. The difference
between groups was significant (P < .0001).
Stem Cell Mobilization
Successful mobilization was performed in 261 of 269
patients (97%), including 128 of 132 patients in the
VAD group and 133 of 137 patients in the Cy-Dex
group (P value, nonsignificant). The medium number
of collected CD34-positive cells was 6.6 3 106 and
8.4 3 106, respectively. The difference was not statistically significant.

Response Rate
The response rates after completion of induction
therapy and after ASCT, which were calculated on an
intent-to-treat basis, are presented in Figure 1. The
corresponding rates for patients who actually underwent ASCT are presented in Figure 2. On an intentto-treat basis, 80% of patients in the VAD group had
achieved at least a PR compared with 81% of patients
in the Cy-Dex group after ASCT. The proportions of
complete responders were 36% and 32%, respectively.
Because immunofixation was not mandatory in the
study, CR rates according to the European Blood and
Bone Marrow Transplantation criteria cannot be
reported. However, using the International Working
Group criteria, the proportion of patients who had a
very good partial remission or better was 38% for the
VAD group and 40% for the Cy-Dex group. No statistically significant differences were observed between
the groups at any stage of the treatment with regard
to these comparisons.
Event-free and Overall Survival
The median event-free survival was 29 months for
both groups at a median follow-up of 22 months
(Fig. 3). With a median follow-up for overall survival

of 39 months, the survival rate at 3 years was 75% in
both groups, (Fig. 4).

DISCUSSION
The development of the VAD regimen was based on
the findings that frequent prednisone pulses
increased the response rate among patients with refractory myeloma4 and that there was a low growth
fraction of plasma cells.5 It appeared plausible that
high doses of dexamethasone given as pulses and
concomitant administration of vincristine and doxorubicin could enhance the antimyeloma effect, and
the first nonrandomized trials produced major
responses after just a few courses.2,6,7 The high proportion of rapidly achieved major responses and the
mild myelosuppression made VAD a suitable initial
therapy before ASCT, a treatment strategy that was
developed during the same period.8,9
However, VAD is a somewhat complicated therapy that demands central venous access and, often,
hospitalization. In addition, it was obvious that,
although the myelosuppression was mild or just
moderate, there were side effects, such as infections.
Other frequent complications included cardiac toxicity and neurotoxicity,6,7,10 which were attributed to
doxorubicin and vincristine, respectively. When scrutinizing the available scientific data, the antimyeloma
effects of vincristine and anthracyclines such as doxorubicin have been questioned. Only minor effects
have been demonstrated for either vincristine or
anthracyclines as single-drug treatments.11,12 Major
responses have been reported for these drugs when
combined with corticosteroids,2,6 and a similar effect
has been reported with high-dose corticosteroids as

single-drug treatment.13 Large overviews of clinical
studies also have failed to demonstrate any superiority of combination treatments, including vincristine
and/or anthracyclines, compared with traditional
oral MP.14,15 Furthermore, in a recent study, alternating courses of VAD and MP were compared with MP
alone. The clinical outcome did not differ, but more
toxicity and morbidity was noted in the VAD/MP
group.16
The current study was designed to investigate
whether a shorter and simplified induction therapy
could bring a greater proportion of patients through
ASCT. We chose to compare conventional VAD, as it
was used in our previous studies,3,17 with an experimental therapy comprising substances with proven
effect in myeloma treatment: corticosteroids and the
alkylating agent cyclophosphamide.18,19 Although it
has an unambiguous antimyeloma effect, melphalan
is not a suitable drug for treating myeloma before stem
cell mobilization because of its stem cell toxicity.20
Cyclophosphamide, conversely, strongly improves
stem cell mobilization,21 and the current results did not
indicate that Cy-Dex interfered in any way with the
stem cell harvest.
In the current study, the Cy-Dex regimen did not
appear to significantly increase the proportion of
patients undergoing ASCT (87% vs 86%), but it
brought an equal proportion of patients more quickly
and more conveniently to ASCT. The number of
deaths caused by treatment toxicity or disease progression during initial therapy was slightly higher in
the VAD group (Table 2), but the numbers were small
and should be interpreted with care. No differences
in efficacy, measured as response, event-free survival,
and overall survival, were observed between the

134

treatment groups. Moreover, the results for both
groups were similar to those from our previous highdose studies.3,17 The feasibility of the Cy-Dex
regimen, with no need for a central venous catheter
at the initiation of therapy and with a low degree
of toxicity, has made it an attractive alternative
among patients and investigators. It also was considered positive for the patient that the total period on
therapy before remission/plateau phase was shortened.
It may be argued that the main effect of Cy-Dex
is caused by the corticosteroids and that the treatment could be simplified even further by not giving
any cytostatic therapy at all. Retrospective studies
have indicated that initial treatment with dexamethasone as single drug is as effective as VAD when
measured as the effect on progression-free or overall
survival.22,23 Another way to make the treatment
more convenient could be to administer cyclophosphamide orally, which has been done successfully.24
A more drastic strategy, aiming at stem cell harvest
directly after diagnosis followed by high-dose MP
and ASCT, also has been tried but did not appear to
be promising, because sufficient numbers of stem
cells were collected in only a minority of patients.25
Recently, a retrospective study demonstrated a
superior response for thalidomide plus dexamethasone compared with VAD as initial therapy before
ASCT, but no information regarding response after
ASCT or survival was reported.26 This highlights a
very important question in clinical myeloma
research: does response before ASCT matter? A
review article recently addressed this question, and
the authors could not find any data supporting the
idea that response before ASCT had any influence on
the survival outcome.27 Our own data demonstrated
a nonsignificant trend toward more patients in CR
and fewer nonresponders in the VAD group before
ASCT, but there were no trends after ASCT and no
effects on event-free or overall survival. Therefore,
we consider it a good strategy to bring myeloma
patients as quickly as possible and with minimum
toxicity to ASCT and, instead, to focus on consolidation or maintenance therapy after ASCT. Currently,
NMSG is performing a prospective, randomized trial
to study the effect of consolidating therapy with bortezomib after ASCT. Patients initially receive Cy-Dex
before ASCT and, 3 months after ASCT, are randomized to receive either a total of 20 doses of bortezomib during 21 weeks or no further treatment until
they develop recurrent disease.
In conclusion, the current study did not identify
any differences between VAD and Cy-Dex as initial
treatment for patients with newly diagnosed multiple

myeloma in terms of response, survival or the proportion of patients undergoing ASCT. The results
indicated that Cy-Dex is a relatively atoxic treatment.
In the Nordic area, 2 cycles of Cy-Dex currently are
considered standard induction therapy.
