ABSTRACT
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) induces
apoptosis in various types of cancer cells without damaging normal cells. However, in
terms of pancreatic cancer, not all cancer cells are sensitive to TRAIL. In this study,
we examined a panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines for TRAIL sensitivity and
investigated the effects of Bcl-2 family inhibitors on their response to TRAIL. Both
ABT-263 and ABT-737 inhibited the function of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w. Of the nine
pancreatic cancer cell lines tested, six showed no or low sensitivity to TRAIL, which
correlated with protein expression of Bcl-xL. ABT-263 significantly sensitized four cell
lines (AsPC-1, Panc-1, CFPAC-1, and Panc10.05) to TRAIL, with reduced cell viability
and increased apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, by siRNA transfection
increased the sensitivity of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells to TRAIL. ABT-263 treatment had
no effect on protein expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, or c-FLIPs. In Panc-1 cells, ABT-263
increased the surface expression of death receptor (DR) 5; the NF-κB pathway, but
not endoplasmic reticulum stress, participated in the increase. In xenograft mouse
models, the combination of TRAIL and ATB-737 suppressed the in vivo tumor growth
of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells. These results indicate that Bcl-xL is responsible for TRAIL
resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells, and that Bcl-2 family inhibitors could
represent promising reagents to sensitize human pancreatic cancers in DR-targeting
therapy.

evidence, TRAIL and its DRs are expected to be
promising target molecules in anti-cancer therapy [5, 6].
Many molecules are involved in apoptosis [7].
Among them, the Bcl-2 family of molecules is involved
in intrinsic apoptosis via mitochondria [8, 9]. The family
of Bcl-2-related anti-apoptotic proteins includes Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, Bcl-w, and Mcl-1. These proteins inhibit cell
death by sequestering the pro-apoptotic proteins Bax and
Bak and by preventing their oligomerization [10–13]. An
increase in Bcl-2 expression protects cancer cells from
apoptosis [14, 15], and the elevated expression of Bcl-2
and Bcl-xL has been frequently observed in a variety of
cancers [9]. Thus, the inhibition of Bcl-2 and/or Bcl-xL
is hypothesized to potentiate the effect of chemotherapy
and, consequently, several Bcl-2 family inhibitors have
been developed. ABT-737 is a small molecule inhibitor
of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w [16]. ABT-263 (Navitoclax)

INTRODUCTION
Apoptosis is primarily induced in cancer cells
through two major pathways: extrinsic and intrinsic
[1, 2]. Fas ligand (FasL) and tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
can provide a death signal via the extrinsic apoptotic
pathway. It is therapeutically important that only
TRAIL can induce cancer cell death while causing
almost no cytotoxicity to normal cells [3]. TRAIL
receptors consist of positive and negative receptors;
death receptor (DR)4 and DR5 provide pro-apoptotic
signaling, whereas decoy receptor (DcR)1 and DcR2
competitively inhibit apoptotic signaling [3]. Normal
cells show TRAIL resistance with their preferential
expression of DcRs [4]. Based on these lines of

is a clinically approved orally bioavailable inhibitor with
the same specificity as ABT-737 [17, 18]. ABT-199 is
a new, orally bioavailable inhibitor that inhibits Bcl-2
and Bcl-w, but not Bcl-xL [19]. Several reports have
demonstrated the efficacy of these inhibitors against
hematological malignancies as well as solid tumors
[20–26].
In this study, we investigated the effects of the
Bcl-2 family inhibitors on TRAIL sensitivity using a
panel of human pancreatic cancer cell lines. Of nine
pancreatic cancer cell lines, six showed either no or low
sensitivity to TRAIL, and this resistance was positively
correlated with the protein expression of Bcl-xL. ABT263 significantly sensitized four cell lines to TRAIL, with
reduced cell viability and increased apoptosis. Additional
analysis of AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cell lines revealed that the
inhibition of Bcl-xL, but not Bcl-2, increased the TRAIL
sensitivity of these cells. In xenograft mouse models, the
combination of TRAIL and ATB-737 exerted a significant
antitumor effect on AsPC-1 and Panc-1. These results
indicate that Bcl-xL is responsible for TRAIL resistance
in human pancreatic cancer cells, and that the Bcl-2 family
of inhibitors, such as ABT-263 and ABT-737, could be
promising reagents to sensitize human pancreatic cancer
cells to DR-targeting therapy.

(Figure 2A). The expression levels of Bcl-2 and Mcl-1
varied among the nine cancer cell lines, suggesting that
it was not contributing to TRAIL resistance. In contrast,
a higher expression of Bcl-xL was detected in the six
TRAIL-insensitive cell lines compared with the three
TRAIL-sensitive cell lines (BxPC-3, MiaPaca-2, and
SW-1990). We examined the antitumor effect of TRAIL
on the six TRAIL-insensitive pancreatic cancer cell
lines when combined with orally bioavailable Bcl-2
inhibitors, ABT-199 or ABT-263 (Figure 2B). ABT199 is an inhibitor of Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, and ABT-263
is an inhibitor of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w [17–19].
In contrast to the no-combination effect of TRAIL and
ABT-199, ABT-263 significantly augmented the TRAIL
sensitivity of four of the cancer cell lines (AsPC-1, Panc1, CFPAC-1, and Panc10.05). Representative results are
shown in Figure 2C. The two cell lines, CAPAN2 and
HPAF-II, were highly sensitive to ABT-263 alone, and
a dose of 0.5 or 2 μM reduced the cell viability of these
lines by approximately 50%. The relationship between
Bcl-xL expression and TRAIL sensitivity and the
specificity of ABT-263 and ABT-199 suggest that Bcl-xL
is responsible for TRAIL resistance in human pancreatic
cancer cells and that inhibition of Bcl-xL by ABT-263 is
a useful way to sensitize human pancreatic cancer cells
to TRAIL.

RESULTS

Caspase-dependent apoptosis in human
pancreatic cancer cells using a combination of
TRAIL and ABT-263

Varied TRAIL sensitivity of human pancreatic
cancer cell lines
Initially, we examined the sensitivity of nine
human pancreatic cancer cell lines to TRAIL. The
viability of three cell lines (BxPC-3, MiaPaCa-2, and
SW1990) decreased in the presence of TRAIL in a dosedependent manner, whereas the other six lines showed
no or low sensitivity to TRAIL (Figure 1A). We also
examined the expression of the TRAIL receptors on
these cells. Although both SW1990 and Panc10.05 were
slightly positive for DR4, the other seven cell lines were
negative for this receptor. All nine cell lines were positive
for DR5 (Figure 1B). DcR1 and DcR2 were not detected
on all cell lines (Supplementary Figure S1). These results
indicated that DR5 expression does not reflect the TRAIL
sensitivity of the human pancreatic cancer cell lines and
that other regulatory mechanisms determine their TRAIL
sensitivity.

We determined whether the effect seen with a
combination of TRAIL and ABT-263 was the result of
enhanced apoptosis in cancer cells. Compared with either
TRAIL or ABT-263 alone, the combination increased the
percentage of Annexin V+ cells in four of the pancreatic
cancer cell lines (Figure 3A and 3B). Additional analysis
was performed by focusing on two cell lines, AsPC-1
and Panc-1. The combination of TRAIL and ABT263 increased the expression of cleaved caspase-3,
caspase-8, and caspase-9 in AsPC-1 cells (Figure 4A).
In terms of Panc-1 cells, the combination increased the
expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8, but no
clear cleavage of caspase-9 was observed. Bid is the link
between extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis [3]. TRAIL
treatment slightly induced the expression of truncated
Bid in both cell lines, but the addition of ABT-263 failed
to enhance the TRAIL-induced expression of truncated
Bid. Apoptosis by combination treatment of TRAIL and
ABT-263 was inhibited by the addition of caspase-8,
caspase-9, or pan-caspase inhibitors (Figure 4B and
4C). Given that Bax oligomerization and translocation
is essential for intrinsic apoptosis [10, 12] and that
some small molecules sensitize pancreatic cancer cells
to TRAIL via Bax oligomerization and translocation
[27], we examined the expression and localization of

of this anti-apoptotic protein can effectively sensitize

human pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL. However, in
xenograft mouse models, we used ABT-737 in place
of ABT-263 because oral administration of ABT-263
did not work in another xenograft mice model using
human prostate cancer cells and an anti-cancer drug,
docetaxel [35], and because ABT-737 can be administered
systemically [16]. The combination of TRAIL and ABT737 synergistically reduced the viability of AsPC-1 and
Panc-1 cells in vitro, as observed in the case with ABT263 (Figure 7A). We performed experiments in which
tumor-bearing mice were injected intratumorally (i.t.)
with TRAIL (1 μg in 50 μL) and/or intraperitoneally (i.p.)
with ABT-737 (75 mg/kg) on days 0 and 3 after grouping
(Figure 7B and 7C). In both experiments, the combination
of TRAIL and ABT-737 significantly suppressed tumor
growth on day 7 after grouping compared with the groups
treated with either drug separately. Body weight was
measured to evaluate the general condition of these mice,
but no difference was observed among the four groups
(Supplementary Figure S4). These results indicate that
Bcl-2 family inhibitors, such as ABT-737, can sensitize
TRAIL-resistant human pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL
in vivo.

Involvement of the NF-κB pathway, but not ER
stress, in the increased expression of DR5 on
ABT-263-treated Panc-1 cells
The mechanism by which ABT-263 sensitized
pancreatic cancer cells to TRAIL was investigated.
Treatment with ABT-263 showed no effect on the protein
expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL in AsPC-1 and Panc-1
cells (Figure 6A). c-FLIPs are known to be inhibitors of
caspase-8 [28], whereas their expression was not changed
by ABT-263 treatment. We examined the expression of
DRs on these cells and observed that ABT-263 increased
the DR5 expression on Panc-1 cells only (Figure 6B).
The ABT-263 showed no effect on DR5 expression on
CFPAC-1 and Panc10.05 cells, whose sensitivity to
TRAIL was induced by combining TRAIL with ABT263 (Figure 2B and 2C) (Supplementary Figure S3).
Alternatively, ABT-737 has been reported to increase the
DR5 expression on prostate, renal, and lung cancer cell
lines at a transcriptional level as a result of stimulation of
NF-κB activity [29]. Therefore, we examined the effect of
pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), an NF-κB inhibitor
[30], and found that PDTC inhibited an increase in the DR5
expression on ABT-263-treated Panc-1 cells (Figure 6C).
Additionally, because recent reports have revealed that
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress can increase the DR5
expression on/in human cancer cells [31, 32], we examined
the effect of thapsigargin, an ER stress inducer [33], on
the expression of DR5. As shown in Figure 6D, treatment
with thapsigargin increased DR5 expression on Panc-1
cells but not on AsPC-1 cells. Additionally, immunoblot
experiments revealed that thapsigargin increased the
expression of DR5 as well as CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein homologue protein (CHOP), an indicator of ER
stress [34], on AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells (Figure 6E). In
contrast, ABT-263 increased the expression of DR5 only
in Panc-1 cells in the absence of the increased expression
of CHOP. ABT-263 treatment increased the expression of
DR5 in Panc-1 cells, but the combination of ABT-263 and
TRAIL unexpectedly reduced the expression of DR5. We
hypothesized that this result was due to the preferential
apoptosis of TRAIL-treated Panc-1 cells that express DR5
at higher levels. These results indicate that the NF-κB
pathway, but not ER stress, was involved in an increase in
DR5 expression on ABT-263-treated Panc-1 cells.

DISCUSSION
The anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family of proteins,
including Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, protect cancer cells from
apoptosis [10–15]. Several reports have shown that Bcl-2
family proteins contribute to TRAIL resistance [36–39].
Additionally, a report has suggested that knockdown of
Bcl-xL or Mcl-1 can induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer
cells [40]. Furthermore, ABT-263 and ABT-737 induce
apoptosis in prostate cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma,
colon cancer, and glioblastoma when combined with
TRAIL [29, 39, 41, 42]. In terms of human pancreatic
cancer, ABT-737 and obatoclax, which inhibits Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1, were shown to enhance the TRAIL
sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cell lines [43, 44].
However, these studies were performed using only two
pancreatic cancer cell lines, and the in vivo antitumor
effect was not examined.
In this study, TRAIL sensitivity varied among the nine
pancreatic cancer cell lines (Figure 1A). Many mechanisms
are involved in TRAIL sensitivity [45]. We examined the
expression of DRs and DcRs, but TRAIL sensitivity did not
correlate with their expression (Figure 1B). Indeed, DR5,
but not DR4, seems to be important in TRAIL sensitivity.
We also found that the TRAIL sensitivity was inversely
correlated with protein expression of Bcl-xL (Figure 2A).
Additionally, knockdown of Bcl-xL by siRNA significantly
increased the TRAIL sensitivity of AsPC-1 and Panc-1
cell lines (Figure 5), which is consistent with a previous
report that demonstrated that Bcl-xL protects pancreatic
adenocarcinoma cell lines from apoptosis via CD95/DR
signaling [38]. In this study, we utilized three Bcl-2 family

inhibitors: ABT-263 and ABT-737 are inhibitors of Bcl2, Bcl-xL, and Bcl-w [16–18], whereas ABT-199 inhibits
Bcl-2 and Bcl-w, but not Bcl-xL [19]. A comparison of
their effects enabled us to evaluate the role of Bcl-xL in
TRAIL resistance in cancer cells. The results showed the
synergistic or additive antitumor effects of TRAIL and
ABT-263 in four TRAIL-resistant cancer cell lines (Figure
2B and 2C). We previously examined the sensitivity of

normal epithelial prostate cells to ABT-263 and found a
similar sensitivity to ABT-263 in human prostate cancer cell
lines [35], suggesting that its effect is not cancer-specific.
Alternatively, ABT-737 has been reported to potentiate
the TRAIL-induced apoptosis of human pancreatic cancer
cells by conformationally changing Bax and disrupting
the binding of Bak with Bcl-xL [43]. Furthermore, a

50 μL PBS was injected. As a vehicle control for ABT-737, 100 μL DMSO was administered. The tumor size was measured once or twice
weekly. Each group contained six mice. C. BALB nu/nu female mice were inoculated in the right flank with 3 × 106 Panc-1 cells in Matrigel.

agents in the NCI-60 panel identified Bcl-xL as a major
cause of chemoresistance in epithelial cancer cells [46].
This indicates that the protective role of Bcl-xL is not
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

limited to TRAIL-induced apoptosis but also occurs with
chemoresistance. Additionally, we recently found that BclxL is responsible for the docetaxel resistance of human
41911

prostate cancer cells [35]. Alternatively, without TRAIL,
the simultaneous knockdown of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 induced
apoptosis via Bax activation in pancreatic cancer cells [40].
If this were the case, inhibition of both Bcl-xL and Mcl1 could sensitize TRAIL-resistant pancreatic cancer cells
more efficiently than Bcl-xL alone.
In addition to the effect on Bcl-xL, we investigated
other mechanisms by which ABT-263 induced or restored
the TRAIL sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells. Several
possibilities could be proposed as TRAIL-resistant
mechanisms: expression of DcRs, dysfunction of DR4/
DR5, loss or down-regulation of FADD or caspase-8,
overexpression of c-FLIP, overexpression of anti-apoptotic
proteins (e.g., Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL) or mutation of proapoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax and Bak), and overexpression
of inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) [36, 37]. Among these
possibilities, we examined the effects of ABT-263 on the
expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, c-FLIPs, and DR4/DR5 by
focusing on two cell lines, AsPC-1 and Panc-1. We found that
ABT-263 failed to influence the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL,
and c-FLIPs (Figure 6A), but it did reduce the expression of
DR5 on only Panc-1 cells (Figure 6B). In this regard, ABT737 has been reported to increase the expression of DR5 on
prostate, renal, and lung cancer cell lines at a transcriptional
level as a result of stimulation of NF-κB activity [29]. We
tested this possibility and found that PDTC inhibited the
increased expression of DR5 on ABT-263-treated Panc-1
cells (Figure 6C). Alternatively, several chemotherapeutic
drugs and stress inducers have been reported to increase the
expression of DR4 and DR5 on cancer cells [47, 48]. ER
stress is induced when protein-folding stress at the ER is
generated [49]. ER stress increases the protein expression of
DR5 via the unfolded protein response mediator CHOP [31,
32, 34]. Additionally, Bcl-2 inhibitors, such as ABT-737 and
obatoclax, induce ER stress in human melanoma cells [50].
Therefore, we determined whether ER stress was involved
in the increased expression of DR5 on ABT-263-treated
Panc-1 cells, but the result was negative (Figure 6D and 6E).
Totally, our results indicate that the NK-κB pathway, but not
ER stress, may be involved in increased expression of DR5
on ABT-263-treated Panc-1 cells.
In conclusion, we found that Bcl-xL is responsible for
TRAIL resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells and that
the Bcl-2 family inhibitors, including ABT-263 and ABT737, induce/restore the TRAIL sensitivity of pancreatic
cancer cell lines both in vitro and in vivo. The Bcl-2 family

pancreatic cancer cells in DR-targeting therapy.

and HPAF-II) were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). Two other
human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MiaPaCa-2 and Panc1) were kindly provided by Dr. K. Takenaga (Shimane
University Faculty of Medicine) [51]. These cell lines
were maintained in DMEM (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum
(Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) and 20 μg/ml
gentamicin (Sigma-Aldrich).

Cell viability assay
Cell viability was analyzed using the WST-8
assay (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan). At the end of the
incubation period, 10 μl WST-8 solution was added to
each well, and the plates were incubated for an additional
3 h. Absorbance in each well was measured at 560 nm
using a microplate reader (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA,
USA).

Detection of DR and DcR expression on cells
To examine the expression of DR4 (CD261) and
DR5 (CD262), cells were incubated with either antiDR4 (eBioscience, San Diego, CA, USA) or anti-DR5
(eBioscience), followed by staining with FITC-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD,
USA). To examine the expression of DcR1 (CD263)
and DcR2 (CD264), cells were stained with either
FITC-conjugated anti-DcR1 (CD263) (GeneTex, Irvine,
CA, USA), or FITC-conjugated anti-DcR2 (CD264)
(GeneTex). For these incubations, isotype-matched FITCconjugated mouse IgG1 was used as a control. Analysis
was performed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA).

Immunoblotting
Cells were lysed with a mammalian protein
extraction reagent (M-PER; Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL, USA) containing a protease-inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai
Tesque). Equal amounts of protein were resolved on
4–12% gradient or 12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to
polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. The membranes were
blocked and the blots incubated with the following primary
antibodies: anti-Bcl-2 (sc-492; Santa cruz biotechnology
(SCB), Dallas, Texas, USA, anti-Bcl-XS/L (#633901;
BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA), anti-Mcl-1 (sc-819;
SCB), anti-FLIPS/L (sc-5276; SCB), anti-DR5 (#8074; Cell
signaling technology (CST), Danvers, MA, USA), antiCHOP (#2895; CST), anti-caspase-3 (#9668; CST), anticaspase-8 (M032–3; Medical and Biological Laboratories,
Nagoya, Japan), anti-caspase-9 (#9508; CST), anti-Bid
(#2002; CST), anti-β-actin (BioLegend), or anti-α-tubulin
(SCB). After washing, room temperature incubation of
membranes for 30 min with either goat anti-rabbit or goat

anti-mouse alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen) was used to detect the primary
antibodies. Protein bands were visualized using CDP-star
chemiluminescence and imaged using an ImageQuant
LAS-4000 system (FujiFilm, Tokyo, Japan).

Female BALB nu/nu mice, purchased from CLEA
Japan (Tokyo, Japan), were maintained under specific
pathogen-free conditions. The protocol was approved
by the Committee on the Ethics of Animal Experiments
of the Shimane University Faculty of Medicine (Permit
Number: IZ26–103). All efforts were made to minimize
suffering. Mice were inoculated in the right flank with
3 × 106 pancreatic cancer cells and Matrigel (Japan BD
Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan) at a 1:1 volume ratio in a total
volume of 100 μL. When the tumor diameter reached
approximately 5 mm, the mice were pooled and divided
into four groups. On days 0 and 3 after grouping, the
pancreatic cancer-bearing mice were administered an
intratumoral (i.t.) injection of TRAIL (1 μg) and/or an
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of ABT-737 (75 mg/kg).
As a vehicle control for TRAIL, 50 μL PBS was injected.
As a vehicle control for ABT-737, 100 μL DMSO was
administered. The tumor size was measured once or twice
weekly. Each group contained six mice.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was assessed using the Annexin V-FITC
Apoptosis Detection Kit (BioVision, Mountain View,
CA, USA) and PI. Each caspase inhibitor (20 μM), or
the same volume of DMSO as a vehicle control, was
added 1 h before the addition of TRAIL. After staining
with annexin V-FITC/PI, flow cytometric analysis was
performed. Analysis was performed using a FACSCalibur
flow cytometer.

Reagents
For inhibition assays, the following inhibitors were
added 1 h before the addition of TRAIL: pan-caspase
inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale,
NY, USA), caspase-8 inhibitor Z-IETD-FMK (R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), and caspase-9 inhibitor
Z-LEHD-FMK (R&D Systems). Thapsigargin was
purchased from Nacalai Tesque. PDTC was purchased
from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA, USA).

Statistical analysis
Data were evaluated statistically using an unpaired
two-tailed Student’s t-test or an ANOVA together with
Bartlett’s test. A P-value < 0.05 was considered to indicate
significance.

Confocal imaging

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND FUNDING

Cancer cells were seeded onto round microscope
cover glasses in 24-well plates and cultured with TRAIL
(25 ng/mL) and/or ABT-263 (1 μM) for 12 h. After
incubation with Hoechst 33342 (5 μg/ml) and MitoTracker
Red (20 nM) (#9082; CST) for 30 min, cells were fixed
and permeabilized with 3% formalin and 1% Triton X,
respectively, and stained with anti-Bax antibody (D2E11)
(#5023; CST) followed by Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
anti-rabbit IgG F(ab’)2 fragment (CST). The cover glasses
were then placed on slides with 4 μl of mounting medium
for fluorescence (Vectashield; Vector Laboratories, Inc.,
Burlingame, CA, USA). Confocal imaging was performed
using an Olympus FV1000-D laser scanning microscope
(Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
