BACKGROUND. c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are
potential molecular targets in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). Imatinib inhibits
the kinase domain and subsequent downstream signaling of these receptor tyrosine kinases. The objective of this study was to investigate biochemical and biologic effects of imatinib on EOC.

METHODS. Patients with recurrent EOC who had received no more than 4 prior
regimens and who had good end-organ function were eligible. Imatinib was
administered orally at a dose of 400 mg twice daily in continuous, 28-day cycles
with reassessment imaging studies obtained every other cycle. Tumor core biopsies were obtained prior to and at 4 weeks into therapy; microdissected tumor
and stroma were subjected to protein lysate array analysis. Blood samples were
obtained monthly for cytokine measurements.

the molecular signaling that is vital to cancer progression and survival. Protein tyrosine kinases are
initial points for outside-in signaling that drives cellular vitality. They often are dysregulated, mutated,
or overexpressed in human malignancies.3–5 Imatinib
mesylate was the first in this class to demonstrate
clinical benefit6–8. It was designed originally to inhibit the activity of bcr-abl, the fusion gene product
that transforms and drives chronic myelogenous leukemia8. Additional preclinical characterization of this
agent showed that the activity also encompassed
other type III receptor tyrosine kinases, including ckit9–11 and platelet-derived growth factor b (PDGFRb).12
Both c-kit and PDGFR-b have been implicated as
molecular targets for epithelial ovarian cancer.9,13–16
Both markers are expressed in the tumor and also
are found in the supporting stroma.17–20 This led to
our hypothesis that imatinib would alter the growth
of ovarian cancer by targeting its microenvironment
and its growth machinery. We proposed that the
treatment of women who had epithelial ovarian cancer with imatinib would result in perturbation of ckit and PDGFR-b activity and/or quantity with secondary effects of altering the activation of downstream signaling targets. This Phase II trial was
designed to explore the clinical activity and toxicity
of imatinib in patients with ovarian cancer and to
profile changes in biochemical signaling events in tumor and stroma using tissue lysate array proteomics.21

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligibility
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the National Cancer Institute (Bethesda,
Md), and written informed consent was obtained
before enrollment. Eligible patients had recurrent
epithelial ovarian cancer for which they had: received
4 prior regimens; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0, 1, or 2; and
had good end-organ function (leukocyte count
3000/mm3, absolute neutrophil count >1500/mm3,
hemoglobin 9.0 g/dL, platelets 100,000/mm3, serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL, transaminases 2.5
times the upper limit of normal, and bilirubin 1.5
mg/dL). Measurable disease by physical examination,
noninvasive radiographic imaging, or surgical evaluation was required, including 1 lesion that would be
subjected to core-needle biopsy. No chemotherapy or
radiation was allowed within 4 weeks of study entry
(6 weeks for carboplatin) and recovery of pre-existent
clinical toxicity to grade 1. Ineligible patients had

brain metastases, cardiac dysrhythmias that required
treatment, active infection, a prior invasive cancer, or
concomitant use of medication with potential interaction with imatinib. Patients who had rapidly progressive disease with potential for an imminent
medical catastrophe (eg, bowel obstruction or fistula)
were counseled to consider chemotherapy.

On-study and Cycle Evaluations
Patients were assessed before starting and monthly
with a history and physical examination, including
pelvic examination by a gynecologic oncologist, history of prescription and nonprescription drugs, and
assessment of adverse events. Pretreatment studies
included a complete blood count (CBC); platelet
count; electrolytes; renal, mineral, and liver function
panels; urinalysis; prothrombin time; CA-125; electrocardiogram; and chest radiograph within 4 days of
enrollment; laboratory studies were repeated each
cycle with CBC and transaminases checked weekly
during the first cycle. Imaging of measurable disease
was performed within 14 days of initiation and then
at least every other cycle.

Treatment Plan and Dose Modifications
The initial imatinib dose was 400 mg twice daily on
continuous, 28-day cycles starting the day after the
initial research biopsy. Adverse-event diaries were
kept by the patient and were reviewed each cycle;
Adverse events were graded according to Common
Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2.0. Treatment was interrupted for patients who experienced CTC grade
3/4 toxicity with a dose reduction if treatment was
reinitiated. The dose was reduced (200 mg daily) for
resolved grade 3/4 or progressive or recurrent grade
2 toxicity. Patients were not eligible to resume imatinib if the time to resolution to grade 0/1 toxicity was
>4 weeks. Dose reduction to 400 mg daily was
allowed. Patients who could not tolerate 400 mg daily
were removed from study.

Response Assessment and Clinical Endpoints
Tumor status was characterized by using Radiographic Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
criteria.22 CA-125 was measured but was not used to
monitor disease response, because the effects of
imatinib on CA-125 production and secretion are
unknown. Development of a new effusion, pleural or
peritoneal, was not considered progressive disease,
because this is a known complication of imatinib
therapy.11,23

Translational Studies
Analysis of plasma and ascites cytokine concentrations
Blood was sampled in heparinized tubes on-study
and at monthly clinic visits. Plasma was separated,
aliquoted, and stored at 708C within 4 hours. Ascites and pleural fluids that were collected for research
were spun free of cells, aliquoted, and frozen within
2 hours. Concentrations of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor
AB (PDGF-AB), PDGF-BB, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8,
and IL-1b were measured by using commercial
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Quantikine immunoassay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minn).
Tissue lysate array proteomics
Patients underwent percutaneous 16-gauge to 18gauge tumor biopsy under ultrasound or CT guidance prior to treatment and again at 4 weeks. A
single attempt at biopsy was allowed; if it was unsuccessful, then patients proceeded with treatment, but
no further biopsies were attempted. Core-needle
biopsies were frozen immediately in optimum cutting temperature medium and were stored in liquid
nitrogen until use. Frozen sections (6 lm) for lasercapture microdissection on uncharged glass slides
were dehydrated, fixed, and stained using hematoxylin, and from 20,000 to 30,000 cells were captured.24
Protein was extracted using approximately 15 lL
Tissue Protein Extraction Reagent buffer (Pierce
Biochemicals, Rockford, Ill) diluted 1:1 with sample
buffer, as described previously.25 Captured cells or
lysates were stored at 808C until protein extraction
and printing of the tissue lysate array (TLA) onto
glass-backed nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher &
Scheuell Bioscience, Keene, NH) in a triplicate, 5point, serial 1:1 dilution curve using an Affymetrix
417 arrayer (Santa Clara, Calif). Controls included
lysates of epidermal growth factor-stimulated HeLa
cells and Fas-ligand treated Jurkat cells.
Total protein loading was quantified using colloidal gold stain. Signals of interest were detected with
a titer-optimized antibody against total or phospho
(p)-specific protein followed by catalyzed signal
amplification system (DakoCytomation Catalyzed
Signal Amplification System; DAKO Cytomation, Carpinteria, Calif). Stained arrays were digitized and
spot intensities quantified using ImageQuant version
5.2 (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, Calif). Signal
intensities were normalized to total protein signal to
account for variations in protein loading.
Statistical Considerations
The trial was conducted as a single-arm, 2-stage,
Phase II clinical trial using an optimal design that

311

evaluated the primary objective of clinical outcome,
which was defined as objective response or disease
stabilization for 6 months. The trial was designed
to rule out a response/stabilization probability of
20% (P0 5 .20) in favor of activity of 40% (P1 5 .40)
with an a 5 .10 and b 5 .10. In the first stage, if
from 0 to 3 of 17 patients attained the targeted outcome, then accrual would cease, and the conclusion
would be made that imatinib is not sufficiently
active. If 4 of 17 patients attained the targeted outcome, then accrual would continue to a total of 37
patients with 11 patients required to consider imatinib active in epithelial ovarian cancer.
Secondary objectives include an evaluation of
the effects of imatinib on PDGFR and c-kit and their
downstream signal transduction pathways in tumor
tissue of epithelial ovarian cancer patients, to correlate signaling events with outcome and toxicity, and
to evaluate the effect of imatinib on circulating proangiogenic cytokine production. The biologic endpoints were deemed exploratory and there was no
fixed requirement for sample size. The proteomics
data were analyzed as standardized values:
NIV ðNormalized intensity valueÞ:
IntensityBackground value
Total protein
Each tumor lysate assay parameter was tested
for a trend according to grade of toxicity using an
exact Jonchkeere-Terpstra trend test.26 For these evaluations, no formal correction for multiple comparisons was performed because of the exploratory
nature of the study, the large number of parameters
evaluated, and their varying degrees of independence
from one another. However, a P value <.01 may be
considered sufficiently small to interpret the result as
statistically significant, whereas .01 <P< .05 would
suggest a trend. Relative changes from baseline for a
set of 6 cytokine concentrations were compared
between patients with or without effusion by using
an exact Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Two-tailed P values
for these comparisons are presented after an adjustment using the Hochberg procedure.27

RESULTS
Patients and Clinical Course
Twenty-three patients were enrolled (Table 1). Seven
patients started imatinib at 400 mg twice daily but,
because of grade 3 toxicity in 6 of 7 patients, either the
dose was reduced to 600 mg daily, or the drug was discontinued before completion of the first month of ther-

apy. The protocol was amended to reduce the starting
dose to 600 mg daily, and accrual was reinitiated.

Clinical Outcome
Table 2 outlines the clinical effects observed. The targeted outcome was objective response or disease stabilization that lasted 6 months. There were no
objective responses, and 2 patients had disease stabilization that lasted 8 months and 14 months, respectively. A slowing in clinical progression was observed
in patients who were on treatment for at least
4 months compared with their clinical behavior prior
to the initiation of imatinib therapy.
Toxicity
Grade 3 toxicity at an imatinib dose of 400 mg twice
daily included new onset ascites or pleural effusion,
leukopenia, anemia requiring transfusion, and gastrointestinal symptoms (Table 3). Grade 3 events that
were observed at the lower dose included dyspepsia,
peripheral edema, hypoalbuminemia associated with
fluid retention, hypotension, and fatigue. Fluid accumulation, gastrointestinal toxicity, fatigue, and anemia were the most frequently observed events and
resulted in study withdrawal by 7 patients. Five of
those patients received 400 mg twice daily, and
2 patients received 600 mg daily.
Significant fluid retention was observed in 19 of
22 evaluable patients (86%). Six patients had ascites
(2 exacerbation; 4 de novo). Cytology was malignant
in 3 of 4 sampled effusions. Six patients developed

pleural effusions, and others had peripheral or facial
edema. When imatinib therapy was discontinued,
fluid accumulation ceased within days and, if removed therapeutically, did not recur without reinstitution of imatinib. This also occurred with malignant
effusions. Ascites and pleural effusions developed
between 2 months and 6 months into therapy.

Analysis of ascites and plasma cytokine concentrations
Plasma sampling for proangiogenic cytokine measurement was planned prospectively, prior to reports
that circulating VEGF varied in response to smallmolecule kinase inhibitors.28–31 The absolute ranges
of measured cytokine concentrations in plasma and
ascites were variable (Table 4). The relation to drug
exposure was studied by assessing the maximal

change from baseline. After adjustment for multiple
comparisons, the maximal relative change in IL-6
concentration was significant between patients who
developed ascites and/or pleural effusion and those
who did not (Table 5) (P 5 .02). Circulating cytokine
concentration dropped rapidly upon drug cessation,
consistent with the clinical picture of ascites resolution, in 1 patient who was sampled after imatinib
discontinuation.

Proteomic profiling and pharmacoproteomics
TLA was used to assess multiple signaling endpoints
in microdissected tumor and stroma samples. Results were obtained from up to 14 of the tumor
samples and stroma from up to 10 of the samples
(Fig. 1). Reasons for an incomplete translational
cohort included: no matched biopsy (14 samples),
inflammatory infiltration preventing clean microdissection (4 samples), and inadequate amount of
stroma (13 samples). Samples that had negative
results (no measurable signal) were censored from
statistical analysis. The limited clinical outcome
observed precluded analysis of the relation between
biochemical parameters and response. Target inhibition of c-kit was observed in 3 of 6 evaluable
patients using the TLA (from 53% to 259%) (Fig. 1).
Biochemical inhibition in tumor was observed for pextracellular signal-regulated kinase (from 80% to
301%). EGFR phosphorylation, which was included
as a presumptive negative biochemical control, was
inhibited minimally (from 6% to 651%). Table 6
reports the parameters that were associated most
strongly with toxicity, for which the P value for the
association was .01. Recurring patterns were
addressed, because this was a selected subgroup of
the potentially hundreds of comparisons, and the
sample sizes were small. Pretreatment p-c-kit and
EGFR potentially were linked to nausea and vomiting
(P  .01), whereas posttreatment EGFR (P 5 .001)
and PDGFR (P 5 .004) were linked significantly to
fatigue in this study.

We hypothesized that imatinib would alter the local
tumor microenvironment through its inhibition of ckit and PDGFR kinases, resulting in cytostasis of tumor and/or tumor reduction. Kit, abl, and PDGFR kinases have been documented in tumor stroma, and
it has been demonstrated that they are present in
ovarian cancer.9,14,15,32,33 These biochemical targets
were not anticipated as dominant pathways in ovarian cancer. However, their effects on angiogenesis
and stroma are well known, which led to our hypothesis that therapy against the tumor and its microenvironment may be an effective molecular intervention in
ovarian cancer. This Phase II trial included acquisition
of pretreatment and on-treatment tumor biopsies for
measuring drug-mediated target regulation. Twentythree patients with moderately pretreated ovarian
cancer were treated, for whom 15 paired biopsies
were used for biochemical analysis. The 600 mg daily
dose level was reasonably tolerable, and we observed
2 patients who had disease stabilization for 8 months
and 14 months, respectively. No correlation between
changes in biochemical parameters and outcome
were observed for those 2 patients. Target inhibition
of c-kit was observed in 50% of evaluable patients,
whereas 1 of 8 patients had a reduction of p-EGFR
(6%). Pharmacodynamic associations were observed
between the extent of on-study biopsy p-c-kit and
EGFR magnitude with gastrointestinal events and
between on-study biopsy EGFR and PDGFR values
and fatigue.
This trial was developed to examine the ability
of imatinib to remit disease or to stabilize disease
for at least 6 months. The limitation of prior treatment regimens was included because of concern
regarding possible pre-existing bone marrow toxicity.
The 2 patients who had prolonged disease stabilization had received 1 and 2 prior therapies, respectively. A recently reported Phase II imatinib trial (600
mg daily) was limited to patients who had received
4 prior regimens and who were platinum-resistant;
any number of prior platinum/taxane-containing
regimens counted as a single exposure in that trial.
The patients had received a median of 4 prior therapies, and 3 of 12 patients who were evaluable for
response had disease stabilization (from 6.4 months
to 8 months23). Those 3 patients had received from
2 to 4 prior regimens, and 2 patients had experienced no disease-free intervals. Patients in that study
were required to have c-kit- and/or PDGFR/ablexpressing tumors, as evidenced by original tumor
immunohistochemistry. Despite the refinement in
population, the overall outcome differed negligibly
from our larger study group. Current studies suggest

Imatinib Therapeutics in Ovarian Cancer/Posadas et al.

Fluid-accumulation toxicities were problematic,
causing 6 patients to withdraw from our study and
1 patient with stable disease at 5 months but with
persistent and symptomatic, drug-induced ascites
withdrew despite a dose reduction ultimately to 400 mg
daily. Edema and effusions are known adverse events
for patients who receive imatinib.35,36 In addition to
peripheral and facial edema, therapy has been associated with pleural and pericardial effusions.35,37,38
Coleman et al. reported edema in 14% of patients
and ascites in 10% of patients (grade 3 in 2 of 3
patients). New-onset ascites in ovarian cancer generally is interpreted as disease progression.2 The development of ascites was observed in 25% of patients
on this study. At least 1 patient sample was negative
cytologically, and the pace of reversal of ascites upon
drug holiday or discontinuation was rapid. These
observations argue that ascites, even if malignant, is
caused and/or augmented by imatinib therapy. Ovarian cancer reportedly produced and secreted VEGF,
IL-6, and IL-8 into culture medium and ascites in
preclinical models,39–43 and measurable concentrations have been reported in ascites ranging up to 10fold the concentrations observed in serum.43 Our
findings demonstrate secretion of VEGF and IL-6 in
ascites in the lg/mL concentration range, with only
PDGFs observed in greater concentration in serum
than in ascites.
The molecular targets against which imatinib are
focused, abl, PDGFR, and c-kit kinases, are active targets in both stroma and tumor cells. PDGFR and ckit signaling is important in the development and
maintenance of the local vascular milieu.6,44,45 Our
observed induction of VEGF may be a feedback
response to the down-regulation of c-kit and PDGFRmediated signaling events involved in the dynamic
balance of the activated stromal microenvironment.45,46 Recent findings in patients with chronic
myelogenous leukemia have indicated that imatinib
induces a decrease in VEGF levels by inhibiting
VEGF gene transcription through Sp1 and Sp3 transcription factors.30 This finding of decreased VEGF
levels was observed in patients with gastrointestinal
stromal tumors who received imatinib.47 Our observations support those suggested by others that there
is a secondary increase in VEGF and other proangiogenic cytokines with imatinib and other small-molecule signal inhibitors. This may be one explanation
for the lack of activity of single-agent imatinib in
ovarian cancer, a cancer with a known strong angiogenic drive.
These findings of secondary activation of pathways for which inhibition was anticipated may be
some of the reasons for the lack of efficacy of imati-

nib in ovarian cancer and other solid tumors for
which activating target kinase mutations are not
dominant. Other potential arguments for the lack of
single-agent activity include the insufficiency of inhibition of a single receptor tyrosine kinase to impact
downstream signaling cascades,48 the possibility that
there is promiscuity of the agent in vivo in an unrecognized fashion that alters the signaling balance, and
that the target(s) of imatinib are neither necessary
nor sufficient to alter the natural history of ovarian
cancer. The proteomic endpoints tested in this trial
were selected in part to address these possibilities.
The lack of inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation provides some suggestion of biochemical target selectivity. The cytosolic biochemical events studied are
found downstream of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases and may be limited in their imatinib-mediated
down-regulation, because EGFR and possibly other
kinases remain active. A similar finding was observed
in our Phase II study of single-agent gefitinib in ovarian cancer.49 Our findings validate in vitro studies
from Matei et al., who demonstrated that AKT activation typically occurs after therapy with imatinib
mesylate.34 The power of our findings, however, rests
in the ability to demonstrate this impact on molecular signaling in a prospective fashion in patient tumor samples.
These clinical and signaling results support consideration of imatinib use in ovarian cancer in a
combination approach to dysregulate proangiogenic
signaling, although, as a single agent, imatinib
should be considered ineffective for the treatment of
epithelial ovarian cancer. This would test the hypothesis that the effect of imatinib may have been
masked in part by a stimulatory feedback effect on
angiogenesis. Combinatorial therapy with agents
such as bevacizumab to adsorb VEGF ligand or sorafenib or sunitinib, inhibitors of VEGFR kinase, may
block that feedback activation. Successful combination therapy such as this may redefine a role for imatinib in ovarian cancer.
