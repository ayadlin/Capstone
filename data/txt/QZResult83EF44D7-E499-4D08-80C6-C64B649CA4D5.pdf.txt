Abstract
Androgen receptor (AR) transactivation is known to enhance
prostate cancer cell survival. However, the precise effectors
by which the prosurvival effects of androgen and AR drive
prostate cancer progression are poorly defined. Here, we
identify a novel feed-forward loop involving cooperative
interactions between ligand-activated AR and heat-shock
protein 27 (Hsp27) phospho-activation that enhance AR
stability, shuttling, and transcriptional activity, thereby
increasing prostate cancer cell survival. Androgen-bound AR
induces rapid Hsp27 phosphorylation on Ser78 and Ser82
residues in an AR- and p38 kinase–dependent manner. After
this androgen-induced, non-nuclear phospho-activation,
Hsp27 displaces Hsp90 from a complex with AR to chaperone
AR into the nucleus and interact with its response elements to
enhance its genomic activity. Inhibition of Hsp27 phosphorylation, or knockdown using the antisense drug OGX-427,
shifted the association of AR with Hsp90 to MDM2, increased
proteasome-mediated AR degradation, decreased AR transcriptional activity, and increased prostate cancer LNCaP cell
apoptotic rates. OGX-427 treatment of mice bearing LNCaP
xenografts transfected with an androgen-regulated, probasinluciferase reporter construct resulted in decreased bioluminescence and serum PSA levels as pharmacodynamic readouts
of AR activity, as well as AR, Hsp27, and Hsp90 protein levels
in LNCaP tumor tissue. These data identify novel nongenomic
mechanisms involving androgen, AR, and Hsp27 activation
that cooperatively interact to regulate the genomic activity of
AR and justify further investigation of Hsp27 knockdown as an
AR disrupting therapeutic strategy in prostate cancer. [Cancer

Introduction
The androgen receptor (AR), a ligand-dependent transcription
factor and member of the class I subgroup of the nuclear receptor
superfamily, plays a key role in prostate carcinogenesis and
progression. The classic model of androgen-regulated AR transcriptional activity has not fully defined the many diverse effects of
androgens on prostate cancer cell survival and growth. In response
to androgen, cytoplasmic AR rapidly translocates to the nucleus
and interacts with sequence-specific androgen response elements

(ARE) in the transcriptional regulatory regions of target genes
(1, 2). In addition to this transcriptional genomic action, androgens
and other steroid hormones like progesterone and estrogen can
exert rapid nongenomic effects that are not mediated through
nuclear receptors, but rather initiated at the plasma membrane,
presumably through surface receptors (3, 4).
Like progesterone (PR) and estrogen (ER) receptors, AR can
interact with the intracellular tyrosine kinase c-Src to activate
the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway (5, 6). In
androgen-sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells, AR interacts with
the SH3 domain of Src within minutes of androgen treatment to
promote cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation (5, 6).
Androgens also rapidly stimulate Raf-1 and Erk-2, both components of the MAPK signaling cascade (5), suggesting that androgenstimulated MAPK activation occurs via nongenomic mechanisms.
This nongenomic action of androgen can also influence classic
genomic AR activity, including modulation of AR by coactivators
(7). Phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt is another pathway
involved in nongenomic activity of ER and PR (8, 9), as well as
AR (3, 10). In fact, androgen-activated PI3K and Akt enhance cell
growth and survival in AR-positive cells, which can be inhibited by
PI3K inhibitors or dominant-negative Akt. AR is found in a large
protein complex with p85a-PI3K and Src, both required for
androgen-stimulated PI3K/Akt activation (3, 10).
Molecular chaperones are involved in processes of folding,
activation, trafficking, and transcriptional activity of most steroid
receptors, including AR. In the absence of ligand, AR is predominantly cytoplasmic, maintained in an inactive but highly responsive
state by a large dynamic heterocomplex composed of heat-shock
proteins (Hsp), co-chaperones, and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR)–
containing proteins. Ligand binding leads to a conformational
change in the AR and dissociation from the large Hsp complex.
Subsequently, the AR translocates to the nucleus, interacts with
coactivators, dimerizes, and binds to its ARE to transactivate target
gene expression (11). Dissociation of the AR-chaperone complex
after ligand binding is viewed as a general regulatory mechanism of
AR signaling (11). Molecular chaperones remain important players
in the events downstream of receptor activation and throughout the
life cycle of the AR. For example, the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin,
destabilizes AR and increases its proteasomal degradation, thereby
decreasing the expression of AR-regulated genes (12). Recent reports
further highlight the important roles of other co-chaperones on AR
activation. Bag-1L is overexpressed in hormone refractory prostate
cancer (13) and enhances the transactivation of the AR by using its
NH2 and COOH-terminal domains to bind to COOH- and NH2terminal sequences of AR (14). Another co-chaperone, FKBP52, also
increases AR transactivation activity (15, 16), and FKBP52 knock-out
mice exhibit defects in male reproductive tissues, including
ambiguous external genitalia and defects in prostate and seminal
vesicle development.

Another class of Hsps that complex with ER and glucocorticoid
receptors (GR) are ATP independent and include Hsp27 (17). Hsp27
is a cytoprotective chaperone expressed in response to many stress
signals to regulate key effectors of the apoptotic machinery,
including the apoptosome, the caspase activation complex (18, 19),
and proteasome-mediated degradation of apoptosis-regulatory
proteins (20, 21). Antisense knockdown of Hsp27 delays prostate
cancer xenograft growth and androgen-independent progression
(22, 23). Although Hsp27 is induced by estrogens and glucocorticoids (24, 25), its relationship with AR and androgens is undefined.
Here, we identify a feed-forward loop whereby androgen-bound AR
induces rapid Hsp27 phosphorylation that, in turn, cooperatively
facilitates genomic activity of the AR, thereby enhancing prostate
cancer cell survival.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and antisense oligonucleotide transfection. LNCaP cells
are maintained in RPMI with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS; ref. 26) and
treated with Hsp27 antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designated OGX-427
(OncoGenex Technology, Inc.) or mismatch control oligonucleotide (ODN)
with OligofectAMINE in serum-free OPTI-MEM (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Inc.) for 20 min. Four hours later, 5% FBS was added. Cells were
treated once daily for 2 successive days and harvested 48 h after the second
treatment.
Plasmids, reagents, and antibodies. An Hsp27 wild type (wt) was
subcloned into pcDNA3.1-GFP (Invitrogen-Life Technologies). The Hsp27
triple mutant (TM) was generated by introducing direct mutagenesis,
replacing Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82 with alanine using QuikChangeR II XL, sitedirected mutagenesis kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Stratagene). R1881 (Perkin-Elmer) was dissolved in 100% ethanol. Cyclohexamide, MG-132, SB 203580, and LY 294002 were purchased from
Calbiochem; Hsp27, pHsp27, and Hsp90 were from StressGen; MDM2,
AR N-20, and AR-441 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; and
pAkt/Akt, pp38/p38, and poly(ADP ribose)polymerase (PARP) were from
Cell Signaling Technology.
Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays. LNCaP cells were plated in
RPMI with 5% FBS and switched to charcoal-stripped serum (CSS) the next
day with or without 10 nmol/L R1881. After a time course exposure, LNCaP
cell growth was measured using the crystal violet assay as previously
described (23). Detection and quantitation of apoptotic cells were done by
flow-cytometric analysis as previously described (23). Each assay was done
six times.
Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation. Total proteins
(500 Ag) were pre-cleared with protein-G sepharose (Invitrogen Life
Technologies) for 1 h at 4jC and immunoprecipitated with 2 Ag of antiHsp27, anti-AR, or immunoglobulin G (IgG) as a control overnight at 4jC. The
immune complexes were recovered with protein-G sepharose for 2 h and then
washed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) at least thrice,
centrifuged, and submitted to SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blotting.
Immunofluorescence. LNCaP cells were grown on coverslips and
treated FR1881 for 15 min. For Hsp27 knockdown, cells were treated with
50 nmol/L Hsp27 ASO as described above. After treatment, cells were fixed
in ice-cold methanol completed with 3% acetone for 10 min at 20jC. Cells
were then washed thrice with PBS and incubated with 0.2% Triton/PBS for
10 min, followed by washing and 30 min blocking in 3% nonfat milk before
the addition of antibodies overnight to detect Hsp27 (1:500) and AR (1:250).
Antigens were visualized using anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies
coupled to FITC or rhodamine (1:500; 30 min). Photomicrographs were
taken at 20 magnification using Zeiss Axioplan II fluorescence
microscope, followed by analysis with imaging software (Northern Eclipse,
Empix Imaging, Inc.).
Transfection and luciferase assay. LNCaP cells (2.5  105) were plated
on six-well plates and transfected using lipofectin (6 AL per well; Invitrogen
Life Technologies, Inc.). The total amount of plasmid DNA used was
normalized to 2 Ag per well by the addition of a control plasmid. Media

were replaced by CSS F R1881 24 h after transfection for another 24 h.
Luciferase activities measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
System (Promega) with the aid of a microplate luminometer (EG&G
Berthold). All experiments were carried out in triplicate wells and repeated
five times using different preparations of plasmids.
Northern blot analysis. Total RNA was isolated from LNCaP cells treated
with OGX-427 or mismatch control, transfected with empty vector, Hsp27 wt,
or Hsp27 TM, and treated with SB203580 before R1881 (10 nmol/L)
treatment for 24 h using TRIzol/chloroform extraction (Invitrogen Life
Technologies, Inc.). A 10-Ag aliquot from each sample was subjected
to horizontal electrophoresis and followed by hybridization with Hsp27
(700 pb) or prostate-specific antigen (PSA; 2 kb) cDNA probe as described
(23) and human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)
cDNA probe for normalization of loading levels.
Electromobility shift assay. LNCaP cells were treated with indicated
concentrations of OGX-427 or mismatch control. Forty-eight hours after the
second treatment, nucleoplasmic proteins were extracted using CeLytic
NuCLEAR Extraction Kit (Sigma). The nuclear extract (10 Ag) was incubated
in a final volume of 20 AL containing DNA-binding buffer [10 mmol/L TrisHCl (pH, 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L EDTA, 1 mmol/L DTT, 1 mmol/L
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 20% v/v glycerol] and 1.5 Ag of poly(deoxyiosinic-deoxycytidic acid) (Roche) for 10 min at room temperature
and then incubated for 20 min at room temperature with double-stranded
32
P-labeled (with specific activity of about 300,000 cpm) PSA-ARE
oligonucleotide (27).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation. LNCaP cells were treated with
10 nmol/L of R1881 for 4 h and parafolmaldehyde cross-linked and
sonicated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was done using EZ
ChIP kit according to the manufacturer (Upstate) on the PSA gene regions
ARE I and ARE III as described in ref. 28.
Reverse transcription-PCR. About 4 Ag of total RNA were reverse
transcribed in cDNA using 100 pmol of random hexamer primers
(Pharmacia) and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase
(Life Technologies). The cDNA was successively amplified with two pairs
of AR-specific primers. About 5 AL of cDNA were used as the starting
DNA template in the PCR assay. To verify RNA quality, each sample was
amplified with a set of primers specific to h-actin (5¶-TGATCCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGG-3¶ sense and 5¶-GGACCTGACTGACTACCTCATGAA-3¶ antisense). Analysis of PCR products was done by electrophoresis in
2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.
Protein stability. LNCaP cells were plated and treated with OGX-427
or mismatch control or transfected with Hsp27 wt or empty vector as
described above. Media were changed 48 h later to RPMI + 5% serum
containing 10 Amol/L of cyclohexamide incubated at 37jC for 2 to 6 or 16 h.
Western blot was done using AR, Hsp27, and vinculin antibodies.
In vivo imaging of luciferase activity. Bioluminescence imaging was
done with a highly sensitive, cooled CCD camera mounted in a light-tight
specimen box (Xenogen Corporation) using the protocol as previously
described (29). Before imaging, mice were injected i.p. with 100 mg/kg of the
substrate D-luciferin and anesthetized with 1% of isoflurane. At 15 min
postinjection, mice were imaged by IVIS 200, and bioluminescence was
monitored by Living Image software.
Animal treatment. Male athymic nude mice (Harlan Sprague-Dawley,
Inc.) were injected s.c. with 1  106 LNCaP-Probasin–driven luciferase cells.
Once tumors were palpable with serum PSA levels f25 ng/mL and
bioluminescence detectable using the IVIS-Imaging System, mice were
treated with 20 mg/kg of OGX-427 or mismatch control i.p. once daily for
7 days. Tumor volume, serum PSA, and bioluminescence measurements
were done at baseline and on days 4 and 8.
Statistical analysis. All data were analyzed by Student’s t test. Levels of
statistical significance were set at P < 0.05.

Androgen Receptor Interactions with Hsp27

R1881 enhances LNCaP cell survival in the presence of cytotoxic
stress, including etoposide (30), cyclohexamide (10), and PI3K
inhibitors (31). We recently reported that Hsp27 conferred
resistance to androgen ablation in LNCaP (23) and next set out
to explore whether androgen- and Hsp27-induced prosurvival
activities were interrelated. Before beginning to study relationships
between androgen and Hsp27, we first confirmed that R1881 added
to androgen-depleted CSS increased LNCaP cell growth (Fig. 1A,
left) and decreased apoptotic rates (Fig. 1A, right) compared with
CSS alone. R1881 protected LNCaP cells to paclitaxel treatment,
lowering apoptotic rates and increasing cell growth (Supplementary Data S1). R1881 also protected LNCaP cells from apoptosis

induced by OGX-427, a second-generation ASO that potently
decreases Hsp27 levels (23). OGX-427–induced knockdown of
Hsp27 was associated with decreased apoptotic rates in R1881treated cells, as measured by fluorescence-activated cell sorting
(FACS) and PARP cleavage (Fig. 1B and C). Collectively, these
results indicate that androgens suppress apoptosis induced by
Hsp27 knockdown or paclitaxel.
Androgens lead to rapid Hsp27 phosphorylation via p38
MAPK pathway. Androgens stimulate growth and survival via
both genomic and nongenomic pathways. Recently identified
nongenomic effects include activation of Src, PI3K, and Akt
(3, 10). Because Akt has been reported to phosphorylate Hsp27 in

Figure 1. Androgen enhances LNCaP cell survival. A, left, R1881 enhances LNCaP cell growth. Cells were treated with 1 nmol/L R1881 for 2, 4, and 6 d,
and cell growth rates were determined by MTS assay and compared with control (day of treatment defined as 100%). Right, R1881 protects LNCaP cells from
apoptosis. Cells were treated with 1 nmol/L R1881 for 4 d, and proportion of cells in sub-G0, G0-G1, S, G2-M was determined by propidium iodide staining. B and C,
R1881 protects cells from apoptosis induced by OGX-427. B, left, cell growth rates were compared with control (1 d after transfection) using MTS assay 2 and
5 d post-transfection. B, right, apoptotic rates were determined 5 d post-transfection. C, LNCaP cells were pretreated with 10 nmol/L R1881 or CSS for 48 h before
treatment with OGX-427 or mismatch control. PARP cleavage and Hsp27 expression levels were measured by Western blot. All experiments were repeated at least
thrice.

intact neutrophils (32), we tested whether androgen leads to Hsp27
phosphorylation. Interestingly, androgen induced rapid phosphorylation of Hsp27 on both Ser78 and Ser82 residues in a dose- and
time-dependent manner (Fig. 2A). Within 15 min after incubation
with 10 nmol/L R1881, Ser78 and Ser82 phosphorylation levels
increased 3.2- and 5.3-fold, respectively (Fig. 2A, right).
To identify upstream effectors of androgen-induced Hsp27
phosphorylation, we analyzed R1881-induced changes in p38
kinase and Akt phosphorylation levels, both previously associated
with Hsp27 activation (32, 33). R1881 enhances p38 kinase and Akt
phosphorylation in a time-dependent manner, with maximum
stimulation at 15 and 5 min, respectively (Fig. 2B, left and right).
These results suggest that Hsp27 may be phosphorylated via p38
and/or Akt pathways. Preincubation of LNCaP cells with the p38
kinase inhibitor, SB 203580, abolished R1881-induced Hsp27
phosphorylation (Fig. 2C, left), whereas the Akt inhibitor, LY
294002, did not alter androgen-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation
(Fig. 2C, right), indicating that androgen-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation occurs via the p38 kinase pathway.

Androgen-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation is AR dependent.
To determine whether AR is required for androgen-induced
phosphorylation of Hsp27, changes in Ser78 and Ser82 phosphorylation levels were analyzed after treatment with R1881 F the antiandrogen bicalutimide. Bicalutimide inhibited R1881-induced
Hsp27 phosphorylation at both sites (Fig. 3A), suggesting that
ligand binding to AR is required for Hsp27 phosphorylation by
R1881. Next, PC3 cells, which do not express endogenous AR, were
transfected with increasing amounts of AR or empty vector with or
without R1881. As shown in Fig. 3A, Hsp27 phosphorylation levels at
both Ser78 and Ser82 sites increased with increasing AR levels after
R1881 treatment. In AR-negative PC3 cells, Hsp27 phosphorylation
is insensitive to androgens, but is enhanced when AR is transiently
overexpressed in PC3 cells. These results confirm that AR is
required for androgen-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation.
To further define mechanisms of androgen-induced Hsp27
phosphorylation, we determined whether Hsp27 and AR interact
using coimmunoprecipitation for Hsp27 and AR in LNCaP cells.
Hsp27 is detected in AR immunoprecipitated complexes, and

Hsp27 requires p38 MAPK pathway.
A, R1881 leads to rapid phosphorylation
of Hsp27 on both Ser78 and Ser82 residues
in a dose- (left ) and time-dependent
(right ) manner: LNCaP cells were
maintained in CSS for 16 h before R1881
treatment. Total proteins were analyzed by
Western blotting with anti–phospho-Hsp27
Ser78 or Ser82 or anti–total Hsp27 for
control loading. B, R1881 leads to
phosphorylation of p38 kinase (left ) and
Akt (right ) in a time-dependent manner
as shown using anti–phospho-Akt or
anti–phospho-p38 antibodies. Anti–total
Akt or anti–total p38 was used for control
loading. C, the p38 inhibitor SB203580
(10 Amol/L; left ), but not the Akt inhibitor
LY98059 (right ), inhibits R1881-induced
Hsp27 phosphorylation. After 5 or 15 min
R1881 (for AKT or p38, respectively),
total lysates were analyzed by Western
blotting Hsp27 anti–phospho-Hsp27 Ser78
or Ser82 or anti–total Hsp27 for control
loading.

Androgen Receptor Interactions with Hsp27

Figure 3. Androgen-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation requires AR. A, bicalutimide inhibits R1881-induced Hsp27 phosphorylation. LNCaP cells were starved for
16 h before adding 10 nmol/L R1881 for 15 min F 1 Amol/L bicalutamide, and total protein analyzed by Western blotting with anti–phospho-Hsp27 Ser78 or Ser82,
or anti–total Hsp27 for control loading. B, androgen increases phospho-Hsp27 levels in AR-transfected PC-3 cells. PC3 cells were transiently transfected with
100 to 500 ng of pcDNA-hAR, followed by 10 nmol/L R1881 for 15 min, and total protein was then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-AR, anti–phospho-Hsp27 Ser78
or Ser82, or anti–total Hsp27 for control loading. C, AR interacts with Hsp27. 500 Ag of total extract were immunoprecipitated with 2 Ag of anti-Hsp27, anti-AR,
or IgG as a control overnight at 4jC. The immune complexes were recovered with protein-G sepharose for 2 h and submitted to Western blotting with anti-AR or
anti-Hsp27 (left ). AR and Hsp27 colocalize and translocate into the nucleus after R1881: LNCaP cells were treated FR1881 for 15 min and fixed in methanol/acetone for
immunofluorescence staining with anti-Hsp27 and anti-AR antibodies (right). D, androgen increases Hsp27 levels in complex with AR as Hsp90 levels decrease.
LNCaP cells were maintained in CSS for 16 h and treated for indicated times with 10 nmol/L R1881. 500 Ag of total extract were immunoprecipitated using AR, and
Western blot was done using Hsp90, Hsp27, and AR antibodies.

conversely, AR is detected in Hsp27 immunoprecipitated complexes (Fig. 3C, left). The domain of AR required for the interaction
with Hsp27 was next analyzed using glutathione S-transferase
(GST)–pulldown assays. GST pulldown after initial equimolar
normalization of GST-AR domain fusion as previously described
(34) indicates that Hsp27 binds with NH2-terminal and ligand
binding (COOH-terminal) domains, but not the DNA-binding
domain of AR (Supplementary Data S2). Furthermore, immunofluorescence illustrates that Hsp27 and AR colocalize in the cytoplasm
of LNCaP cells cultured in the absence of androgens. Importantly,
and of potential functional relevance, both proteins translocate and
colocalize in the nucleus after R1881 treatment (Fig. 3C, right).
Before ligand binding, AR exists in a complex with Hsp90 and
other co-chaperones. The AR-Hsp90 interaction maintains AR in a
ligand-binding conformation necessary for efficient response to
hormone (35). Upon ligand binding, AR is released from Hsp90 and
is translocated into the nucleus. Interestingly, AR immunoprecipitation blots show that shortly after androgen treatment, Hsp27
levels increase in complex with AR as Hsp90 levels decrease
(Fig. 3D), suggesting that upon ligand binding, phospho-activated
Hsp27 replaces Hsp90 to chaperone AR into the nucleus.
Effect of Hsp27 on genomic activity of AR. Many proteins
participate in the activation of AR, either by direct binding or as
part of a tertiary complex regulating the activity of other
transactivators. Because Hsp27 colocalizes with and shuttles
ligand-activated AR during nuclear translocation, we next investi-

gated the effects of phospho-Hsp27 levels on AR transcriptional
activity. This was done by gain-of-function strategies using overexpressing wt Hsp27, as well as loss-of-function strategies using an
Hsp27 ASO (OGX-427), dominant-negative Hsp27 phosphorylation
TM, or an Hsp27 phosphorylation inhibitor (p38 kinase inhibitor,
SB 203580). PSA transactivation assays were done using LNCaP cells
transiently transfected with the luciferase reporter plasmid
regulated by the PSA enhancer-promoter region (6.1 kb) in the
presence or absence of an increasing amount of exogenous wt
Hsp27 (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 Ag). R1881 treatment increased AR
reporter gene expression 34-fold, whereas wt Hsp27 overexpression
increases androgen-stimulated transcriptional activity of PSA a
further 3-fold (Fig. 4A, left). In contrast, Hsp27 knockdown using
OGX-427 decreased the transactivation of the androgen-regulated
PSA reporter in a dose-dependent manner, further supporting a role
for Hsp27 in AR transactivation (Fig. 4A, right).
To determine whether Hsp27 phosphorylation is required for
R1881-induced AR-mediated gene activation, we overexpressed an
Hsp27 TM (Ser15, Ser78, and Ser82 substituted by alanine) in a dosedependent manner and tested its ability to affect R1881-stimulated
PSA transactivation. As shown in Fig. 4B (left), Hsp27 TM
transfection inhibited luciferase transactivation from the PSA
enhancer in response to R1881. Similarly, inhibition of androgeninduced, p38 kinase–mediated Hsp27 phosphorylation using the
p38 kinase inhibitor, SB 203580, suppressed R1881-mediated transactivation of PSA enhancer–driven luciferase activity (Fig. 4B,

as a loading control. Hsp27 TM decreases PSA mRNA expression (middle ). LNCaP cells were transfected with Hsp27 TM; 24 h after transfection, cells were
treated with R1881 for 16 h, and RNA was extracted for Northern blot analysis. p38 kinase inhibition decreases PSA mRNA expression (right ). LNCaP cells were
treated for 2 h with SB203580 (10 Amol/L) before R1881, and RNA were extracted for Northern blot analysis. D, Hsp27 knockdown decreases AR binding

Androgen Receptor Interactions with Hsp27

right). Collectively, these results indicate that androgen-induced
p38 kinase-mediated phosphorylation of Hsp27 is important for
AR-mediated PSA expression.
The preceding data identified a role for phospho-Hsp27 in the
transactivation of PSA. To provide further evidence to substantiate
this hypothesis, Northern blot analyses were done (Fig. 4C) and
indicated that levels of AR-regulated endogenous PSA mRNA
decreases significantly after Hsp27 knockdown (OGX-427; Fig. 4C,
left), p38 kinase inhibition (SB 203580; Fig. 4C, middle), or Hsp27
phosphorylation inhibition (Hsp27 TM; Fig. 4C, right). These results
confirm that Hsp27 levels and phosphorylation status enhance
AR-mediated PSA mRNA expression.
As a transcription factor, AR translocates to the nucleus after
androgen binding, where it interacts with ARE to transactivate its
target genes. Suppression of Hsp27 levels or phosphorylation
negatively regulates androgen-stimulated transcriptional activity of
PSA. To determine whether AR interaction with its response
elements is affected by Hsp27 levels, we next analyzed the effects of
Hsp27 knockdown on AR binding to PSA-ARE using electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with nuclear lysates of LNCaP
cells treated with OGX-427. As shown in Fig. 4D, 10 nmol/L R1881
increased AR binding to ARE, and this effect was specifically
blocked by excess cold PSA oligonucleotide. Hsp27 knockdown
using OGX-427 decreased AR binding to its ARE, confirming that
Hsp27 knockdown decreases AR binding to its ARE. Collectively,
the preceding data indicate that phospho-activated Hsp27 plays a
critical role in androgen-induced nuclear translocation and
transcriptional activity of the AR.
We next explored whether Hsp27 forms a complex with AR on
the ARE of the PSA promoter using ChIP assay in LNCaP cells
FR1881. h-Actin fragment was amplified as control. As shown in
Fig. 4E, Hsp27 is present, along with AR (which serves as a positive
control) on the AREs. In the presence of R1881, higher levels of AR
and Hsp27 were recruited to the promoter proximal region (ARE I)
and also to the enhancer region (ARE III) of the PSA promoter.
These data indicate that Hsp27 continues to interact with the AR
transcriptional complex at the level of the ARE and seems to be
regulated by androgen.
Hsp27 knockdown induces AR degradation via the proteasome-mediated pathway. Hsp27 knockdown or inhibition of
phosphorylation inhibits androgen-stimulated nuclear translocation of the AR with subsequent suppression of AR-regulated gene
expression. To investigate the fate of AR after Hsp27 knockdown,
changes in AR mRNA and protein levels after treatment with
OGX-427 were evaluated. AR mRNA levels did not change after
Hsp27 knockdown (Fig. 5A, left). In contrast, Hsp27 knockdown
decreased AR (Fig. 5A, middle) and Hsp90 (Fig. 5A, right) protein
levels in a dose-dependent manner. The effect of Hsp27 knockdown
on AR protein stability was next evaluated using cyclohexamide,
which inhibits protein synthesis. As shown in Fig. 5C, AR protein
levels decrease significantly with rapid degradation after OGX-427–
induced knockdown of Hsp27. In contrast, Hsp27 overexpression
prolonged AR half-life compared with empty vector-transfected
controls (Fig. 5C). AR degradation after Hsp27 knockdown occurs
via the proteasome pathway because treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 suppressed Hsp27 knockdown-induced AR
degradation (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these findings indicate that
Hsp27 knockdown induces AR degradation via a proteasomemediated pathway.
Hsp27 knockdown disrupts AR-Hsp90 association and
increases AR-MDM2 association and ubiquitination. AR forms

www.aacrjournals.org

a heterodimer complex with Hsp90 to provide stability for ligandunbound AR. Indeed, without Hsp90 binding, the unfolded protein
will be recognized and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome
system (12, 35). Hsp27 knockdown by OGX-427 significantly
disrupts the association between AR and Hsp90 (Fig. 5D, left).
This indicates that Hsp27 knockdown–induced dissociation
between AR and Hsp90 may render the AR-Hsp90 heterocomplex
vulnerable to degradation by the proteasome-mediated pathway.
Because AR has been reported to be ubiquitinated by the E3 ligase,
MDM2 (36, 37), we next set out to determine whether interaction
between MDM2 and AR increased after OGX-427–induced Hsp27
knockdown. As predicted, Hsp27 knockdown increased the
association between endogenous MDM2 and AR as shown by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in Fig. 5D (middle). Furthermore, Hsp27 knockdown increased levels of ubiquitinated AR (Fig.
5D, right). These results indicate that OGX-427–induced Hsp27
knockdown dissociates the Hsp90-AR heterocomplex and increases
MDM2-mediated AR ubiquitination and degradation.
In vivo Hsp27 knockdown by OGX-427 decreases LNCaP
proliferation rates, serum PSA levels, and AR client protein
expression levels. Our results establish a novel mechanism
whereby ligand-activated AR phospho-activates Hsp27 to cooperatively enhance AR nuclear translocation and transcriptional
activity. Hsp27 knockdown leads to AR degradation and reduced
PSA transcription and LNCaP cell growth in vitro. We sought to
determine whether in vivo Hsp27 knockdown with OGX-427
decreased AR activity in LNCaP xenografts. Male nude mice were
injected s.c. with 1  106 LNCaP-Probasin–driven luciferasetransfected cells (Supplementary Data S3), and once tumors were
palpable with serum PSA levels f25 ng/mL and bioluminescence
was detectable using the IVIS Xenogen monitor, mice were
treated with 20 mg/kg of OGX-427 or mismatch control. A bioluminescent signal first became detectable when serum PSA levels
reached f5 ng/mL and was easily detected at serum PSA levels
above 20 ng/mL. Mice were subjected to three different types of
measurements: bioluminescence of probasin-promoter–driven
luciferase activity (a measure of in vivo AR activity in LNCaP
xenografts), serum PSA levels, and tumor volume. Measurements
were done at baseline before treatment (day 0), during treatment (day 4), and at the end of treatment (day 8). Beginning day 4,
OGX-427 decreased bioluminescence and reduced circulating PSA
levels by 60% (P < 0.01), with a slight 15% decrease in tumor
volume (Fig. 6A and B); individual data are presented in
Supplementary Data S4. In contrast, mice treated with mismatch
control ODN showed an anticipated increasing trend on bioluminescence and PSA levels, coincident with increasing tumor
volume during the 8-day treatment period. Western blot of snapfrozen xenograft samples (Fig. 6C) and immunostaining data
(Supplementary Data S5) indicate that OGX-427 decreased LNCaP
xenograft levels of AR, Hsp27, and Hsp90. In addition, OGX-427
also decreased Ki67 staining (Supplementary Data). Collectively,
these data suggest that the in vivo anticancer activity of OGX-427
results, in part, from AR disruption, and that serum PSA may
prove a useful surrogate of pharmacodynamic activity as OGX-427
moves into human trials.

Discussion

activity/degradation of certain client proteins. The chaperone activity

of Hsp27 is regulated by stress-induced changes in phosphorylation
and oligomerization (38). As a cytoprotective chaperone situated as a
Hub at the center of many pathways regulating cellular response to
therapeutic stress, targeted inhibition of Hsp27 would inhibit many
pathways implicated in cancer progression and resistance. The
cytoprotective effects of Hsp27 result from its ubiquitin binding and
degradation of InB (20), direct interference of caspase activation,
modulation of oxidative stress, and regulation of the cytoskeleton
(19, 39). Higher levels of Hsp27 are commonly detected in many
cancers including prostate (22, 23, 40) and is associated with
metastasis, poor prognosis, and resistance to chemotherapy or

radiation (41, 42). We recently reported that overexpression of
Hsp27 in LNCaP cells suppressed castration-induced apoptosis and
confers androgen resistance (23), whereas Hsp27 knockdown using
ASO potently decreases Hsp27 levels, increases caspase-3 cleavage
and apoptosis, enhances paclitaxel chemosensitivity, and delays
tumor progression in vivo (22, 23).
Human Hsp27 is phosphorylated on three serine residues, Ser15,
Ser78, and Ser82. p38 kinase and Akt were reported to be the Hsp27
kinases (32, 33), although protein kinase C (PKC) a and y and cyclic
AMP–dependent kinase can also phosphorylate Hsp27 (43). Hsp27
becomes phosphorylated when exposed to angiotensin (43),

interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1, heat shock and tumor necrosis factor-a
(44). Using LNCaP cells, which express AR and are sensitive to
androgens, we show that androgens increase phospho-Hsp27 levels
within minutes in a dose-, time-, and p38 kinase pathway–

dependent manner. This rapid androgen/AR-mediated Hsp27
phosphorylation identifies a nongenomic mechanism for AR in
LNCaP cells. These findings are in agreement with previous studies
indicating that steroids can act via classic steroid receptors or

through atypical membrane receptors, and that AR mediates
nongenomic activation in response to androgens (6, 10). Ligand
binding to AR induces its association with Src via Src SH3 domain
and AR proline-rich domain, triggering Src-dependent pathway
activation (6, 10). In AR-negative COS-1 and PC3 cells, transfection
of AR is necessary for R1881 induction of c-Src/Raf/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase and Akt, respectively. In AR-positive LNCaP
cells, the anti-androgen bicalutamide suppresses R1881-stimulated
Hsp27 phosphorylation. In AR-negative PC3 cells, Hsp27 phosphorylation is insensitive to androgens, but is enhanced when AR is
transiently overexpressed in PC3 cells. This nongenomic stimulation is supported further by the interaction and colocalization of
Hsp27 with AR. Hsp27 binds with AR via its NH2-terminal domain
and may directly or indirectly involve other AR coregulators,
including signal transducers and activators of transcription 3
(STAT3) and ARA55, both of which have been reported to associate
with Hsp27 (45, 46).
In the classic model of androgen action, in response to
androgens, AR dissociates from Hsp90 (11). Interestingly, we found
that following androgen treatment, Hsp27 becomes more abundantly associated with AR as AR dissociates from Hsp90, suggesting
a dynamic role for molecular chaperones in AR shuttling. This
nongenomic action of AR ultimately influences its classic genomic
effects. Once in the nucleus, ligand-bound nuclear receptors like
AR are recruited to target gene promoters either through direct
binding to hormone response elements or association with other
promoter-bound transcription factors (11). Many proteins participate in the activation of AR, some directly binding to AR, and
others via a tertiary complex with other transactivators. Hsp27 has
now been identified as a chaperone interacting with the AR
transcriptional complex at the level of its ARE. Recent reports
indicate that the AR coactivators STAT3 and ARA55 also interact
with Hsp27 (23, 45). Hence, Hsp27 and AR may complex with either
ARA55 or STAT3 to cooperatively promote AR translocation and
transactivation. Interestingly, PSA transactivation in LNCaP cells is
enhanced by Hsp27 overexpression and suppressed by Hsp27
knockdown or inhibition of Hsp27 phosphorylation. Similarly, in
ER+ MCF-7 breast cancer cells, inhibition of p38 kinase signaling
also blocks ER-mediated transcription by inhibiting nuclear
translocation of ERa (47). Furthermore, Hsp27 knockdown
decreases AR nuclear translocation and binding to its ARE.

Previous studies emphasize the importance of Hsps in steroid
receptor stability. For example, Hsp90 inhibitors such as geldanamycin induce steroid receptor degradation by directly binding to
the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 and thereby inhibiting its function
(12, 35). Results shown in Figs. 5 and 6 indicate that Hsp27
knockdown destabilizes AR by inducing the dissociation of the AR/
Hsp90 heterocomplex and increasing AR association with the E3
ligase MDM2, with subsequent ubiquitin-proteasome–mediated AR
degradation. Although both OGX-427 and geldanamycin share the
ability to abrogate the interaction between AR and Hsp90, they do
so by different mechanisms. Interestingly, OGX-427 induces the
degradation of Hsp27, AR, and Hsp90, whereas geldanamycin
binding to the ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90 inhibits its chaperone
activity (48), induces degradation of client proteins (49), and is
accompanied by stress-activated increases in Hsp70 and Hsp27 (50).
The effects of OGX-427 on AR expression and activity in vitro
were recapitulated in vivo. OGX-427 induced rapid decreases in
probasin-luciferase reporter–driven bioluminescence that correlated with early decreases in serum PSA and decreased LNCaP
xenograft levels of AR and its chaperones, Hsp90 and Hsp27. In
prostate cancer where the AR is critically important, ligandactivated AR leads to rapid p38 kinase–mediated phosphorylation
of Hsp27, which, in turn, complexes with and chaperones the AR
to enhance its stability, shuttling, and transcriptional activity.
OGX-427–induced knockdown of Hsp27 destabilizes the AR and
enhances its ubiquitination and degradation. Collectively, these
data identify a novel mechanism for Hsp27 as an AR chaperone
(as summarized in model illustrated in Fig. 6D) and justifies further
investigation targeting Hsp27 as therapeutic for prostate cancer.
