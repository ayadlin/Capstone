Abstract
The tumor-suppressor p53 prevents cancer development via
initiating cell-cycle arrest, cell death, repair, or antiangiogenesis
processes. Over 50% of human cancers harbor cancer-causing
mutant p53. p53 mutations not only abrogate its tumor-suppressor function, but also endow mutant p53 with a gain of
function (GOF), creating a proto-oncogene that contributes to
tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and chemo- or radiotherapy
resistance. Thus, targeting mutant p53 to restore a wild-type
p53 signaling pathway provides an attractive strategy for cancer
therapy. We demonstrate that small-molecule NSC59984 not
only restores wild-type p53 signaling, but also depletes mutant
p53 GOF. NSC59984 induces mutant p53 protein degradation
via MDM2 and the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway. NSC59984
restores wild-type p53 signaling via p73 activation, speciﬁcally

in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer cells. At therapeutic
doses, NSC59984 induces p73-dependent cell death in cancer
cells with minimal genotoxicity and without evident toxicity
toward normal cells. NSC59984 synergizes with CPT11 to
induce cell death in mutant p53-expressing colorectal cancer
cells and inhibits mutant p53-associated colon tumor xenograft
growth in a p73-dependent manner in vivo. We hypothesize that
speciﬁc targeting of mutant p53 may be essential for anticancer
strategies that involve the stimulation of p73 in order to
efﬁciently restore tumor suppression. Taken together, our data
identify NSC59984 as a promising lead compound for anticancer therapy that acts by targeting GOF-mutant p53 and
stimulates p73 to restore the p53 pathway signaling. Cancer

Introduction

factors such as SP1, NF-Y, p53, and p63/p73, to perturb their
activities (4). The GOF of mutant p53 contributes to tumorigenesis, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy (3). Therefore,
targeting mutant p53 is an attractive strategy to overcome drug
resistance and to sensitize tumors to cancer therapy. This concept
is particularly further developed and mechanistically explored in
this study with NSC59984.
Some small-molecule compounds targeting mutant p53 have
been selected on the basis of putative conformational changes
within mutant p53 to restore wild-type p53. For example,
CP31398 (5), PRIMA-1 (6), and NSC319726 (7) have been
proposed to cause a conformational shift from mutant to wildtype p53, reactivating p53 function in tumor suppression.
Although several small molecules can restore the p53 pathway,
the GOF of mutant p53 can remain in the tumor cell and can
represent an obstacle to tumor suppression as well as therapeutic
efﬁcacy. Eliminating mutant p53 is an approach that we decided
to pursue in an attempt to abolish the GOF properties of mutant
p53 in tumor cells, and with the idea that mutant p53 may
represent a challenge for the general approach to stimulate
p73, given the ability of mutant p53 to quench the tumorsuppressive activity of p73. Few compounds have been reported
to destabilize mutant p53, including 17AAG, Saha, gambogic
acid, and arsenic (8–11). However, those compounds are incapable of restoring the p53 pathway of mutant p53 in tumor cells,
and they have many other targets and mechanisms, making them
nonspeciﬁc. Thus, small molecules with the dual capability to

Tumor-suppressor p53 protects cells from oncogenesis and
promotes sensitivity to anticancer therapy. Over 50% of human
cancers harbor mutant p53, which inactivates p53 pathway signaling and its tumor-suppressor function (1). p53 DNA mutations not only abrogate the p53 tumor-suppressor function, but
can also endow mutant p53 with a gain of function (GOF),
rendering it a proto-oncogene (2, 3). One property of mutant
p53 GOF is to form aberrant protein complexes with numerous
interacting protein factors, including a subset of transcription

Therapeutic Rescue of p53 Deﬁciency in Human Cancer

restore the p53 pathway and deplete mutant p53 GOF proteins
represent a novel strategy for cancer therapy and appear desirable
to pursue for further therapeutic development.
p73, a member of the p53 family, is a transcription factor with
high structural and sequence homology with p53. p73 has been
found to have similar functions as wild-type p53 (12). p73 can
transactivate the vast majority of p53 transcriptional target genes
by binding to their regulatory regions in the same manner as p53,
thereby affecting cell growth and cell death pathways (13). Unlike
p53, p73 is rarely deleted or mutated in human cancer. p73 is
activated by complex signaling pathways in mammalian cells
under stress (14). Activated p73 induces apoptosis and enhances
chemosensitivity. A large variety of chemotherapeutic agents, such
as camptothecin, etoposide, and cisplatin, can upregulate p73
expression (15). However, mutant p53 inhibits p73 activation by
binding with p73 to form an inhibited complex with respect to the
transactivation of target genes (4). Therefore, p73 provides a
legitimate and bona ﬁde attractive target to restore the p53 pathway
in cancer therapy. A peptide, 37AA, has been found to cause p73dependent cancer cell apoptosis (16). A small-molecule, RETRA,
was shown to release p73 by disturbing interaction of p73 and
mutant p53 (17). These studies support the strategy of bypassing
dysfunctional p53 signaling in cancer therapy through stimulation of p73-dependent signaling, while at the same time attempting to eliminate mutant p53, as is reported here.
In this article, we use a functional cell-based high-throughput
screening strategy to identify small-molecule compounds that
both destabilize mutant p53 and restore wild-type p53 pathway
via the activation of p73 in cancer cells. One such compound,
NSC59984, appears to have a favorable therapeutic index, is
nongenotoxic at effective doses that preferentially kill tumor cells,
stimulates p73 activity, targets mutant p53 for degradation, and
displays antitumor effects in vivo in a p73-dependent manner.

Materials and Methods
High-throughput screening
Functional cell-based screening for small molecules that can
increase p53-transcriptional activity was performed using noninvasive bioluminescence imaging in human colorectal cancer cells
that stably express a p53-regulated reporter (Supplementary
Materials and Methods), as previously described (18).
Cell lines
SW480, DLD-1, HCT116, and p53-null HCT116 cells that
stably express a p53-regulated luciferase reporter were generated
in our laboratory in 2003 (18, 19). MRC5, Wi38, Hop92, and
RXF393 were obtained from the ATCC and cultured as recommended. Cells were regularly authenticated by bioluminescence,
growth, and morphologic observation.
CellTiter-Glo luminescent cell viability assay
Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells per well on 96-well plates. Cells
were mixed with an equal volume of CellTiter-Glo reagents
(Promega), following the manufacturer's protocol, and bioluminescence imaging was measured using the IVIS imager.
Knocking down p73 expression by retroviral shRNA
Cells were infected with retrovirus containing the pSIRENREtrpcQ retroviral vector recombinant with TAp73 RNAi. Cells
were cultured with blasticidin for several weeks, and blasticidin-

www.aacrjournals.org

resistant clones were selected. Knockdown of p73 was detected by
measuring p73 protein levels by Western blot analysis (Supplementary Materials and Methods) with anti-p73 antibody (Bethyl
laboratories Inc.).
Overexpression of p73 by adenovirus infection
Cells were infected with an adenovirus that expresses p73-beta
(Ad-p73) or wild-type p53 (Ad-p53) and cultured for 24 hours, as
previously described (20). Then, the infected cells were cultured in
fresh medium and subjected to different treatments.
RNA isolation and semi-quantitative RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from cells using the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen). Reverse transcription used SuperScript II First-Strand
Synthesis System (Invitrogen) with random primers. qRT-PCR
reactions used SYBR Green Master Mix with the Real-Time
PCR Detection systems (Bio-Rad). Primers for quantitative RTPCR (qRT-PCR) are in Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Colony formation assays
Five hundred cells per well on 6-well plate were treated with
NSC59984 for 3 days, then, cells were cultured with drug-free
complete medium for 2 weeks with fresh medium changed every 3
days. Cells were ﬁxed with 10% formalin and stained with 0.05%
crystal violet at the end of 2 weeks period of cell culture (21).
In vivo antitumor assays
All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at Penn State University. Five
million DLD-1 and p73 knockdown DLD-1 cells were implanted
subcutaneously in the opposite ﬂanks in each CRL nude mouse
(female, 4–6 weeks old). Treatment with NSC59984 (i.p. injection) was initiated when the tumor masses reached a size of 3 to
5 mm. NSC59984 (45 mg/kg) was injected by i.p. route every
5 days. Fifteen days after treatment, the mice were euthanized.
Statistical analysis
All results were obtained from triplicate experiments, unless
other indicated. Statistical analyses were performed using PRISM4
Software (GraphPad Software, Inc.), ANOVA, and the Student
t test. Statistical signiﬁcances were determined by P < 0.05.
Combination indices were calculated using the Chou–Talalay
method with CalcuSyn software (Biosoft).

Results
NSC59984 speciﬁcally restores p53 pathway signaling in
mutant p53-expressing human colorectal cancer cells
To identify small molecules that could restore p53 pathway
signaling, we screened approximately 1990 small molecules from
the National Cancer Institute (NCI; Bethesda, MD) chemical
diversity library II using a functional cell-based assay. A small
molecular weight compound, NSC59984 (IPUA name is (E)-1-(4methylpiperazin-1-yl)-3-(5-nitrofuran-2yl)prop-2-en-1-one; Fig.
1A) was found to increase p53-responsive reporter activity in both
SW480 (mutant p53 R273H, P309S) and DLD-1 (mutant p53
S241F) cells in a dose-dependent manner (1/slope ¼ 31.37 in
SW480, and 29.75 in DLD-1, P < 0.01 compared with cells lacking
mutant p53; Fig. 1B and C). Consistent with p53 activation,
endogenous protein levels of p21, Puma, Noxa, and DR5, target
genes of p53, were signiﬁcantly upregulated in SW480 cells and

signiﬁcantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in SW480
and DLD-1 cells at 3 hours after NSC59984 treatment (Fig. 1D).
These results suggest that NSC59984 restores p53 pathway signaling in mutant p53-expressing SW480 and DLD-1 human
colorectal cancer cells. To test whether the effect of NSC59984
on restoration of the p53 pathway was mutant p53-dependent, we
treated HCT116 cells and p53-null HCT116 cells (Fig. 1) with
NSC59984. Increasing doses of NSC59984 slightly induced
p53-responsive bioluminescence in p53-null HCT116 cells (1/
slope ¼ 102.9), and no signiﬁcant increase of p53-responsive
bioluminescence was observed in wild-type p53-expressing
HCT116 cells (1/slope ¼ 328.4; Fig. 1B and C). Puma and p21
were not upregulated at the mRNA level in these two cell lines,
which lack mutant p53, in response to NSC59984 treatment.
Noxa mRNA was slightly increased in response to 25 mmol/L of
NSC59984 in HCT116 and 12 mmol/L of NSC59984 in p53-null
HCT116 cells. However, Noxa mRNA was increased much less in
these two cells than in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells DLD-1
and SW480 (Fig. 1D). Consistent with results showing lack of
increase in mRNA levels of p53 target genes, protein levels of
Puma, DR5, and Noxa were not upregulated in HCT116 and

p53-null HCT116 cells treated with NSC59984. Although p21
protein was upregulated in HCT116 cells and p53-null HCT116
cells (Fig. 1E), the mRNA level of p21 was not signiﬁcantly
increased in response to NSC59984 treatment (Fig. 1D), suggesting that NSC59984-mediated upregulation of p21 protein occurs
at a posttranslational level in HCT116 and p53-null HCT116 cells.
Taken together, these results indicate that NSC59984 restores p53
pathway signaling speciﬁcally in mutant p53-expressing human
cancer cells.
NSC59984 induces cell death in tumor cells but not normal
cells with little or no genotoxicity
We investigated the effect of NSC59984 on cell death in tumor
cells because NSC59984 restores the p53 pathway in mutant p53expressing cancer cells. We ﬁrst determined EC50 values for
NSC59984 using a panel of cancer cell lines bearing different
p53 mutations. The EC50 of NSC59984 varied among different
cancer cell lines tested, which harbor different p53 mutations. The
EC50 of NSC59984 in most cancer cells was found to be significantly lower than those of normal cells (Fig. 2A). FACS analysis
showed that 25 mmol/L of NSC59984 increased the sub-G1 DNA
content (26%–56%) in cancer cells, but not in normal cells at
72 hours after treatment (Fig. 2B). The high dose of NSC59984

8 hours. G, SW480 cells were treated with NSC59984 and DNA damage agent etoposide (EPT) for 8 hours. Genotoxicity was measured by gH2AX.

(50 mmol/L) led to a 55% to 93% cancer cells to have sub-G1
content but only 12% and 30% of DNA content was found to be in
sub-G1 in Wi38 and MRC5 normal human ﬁbroblast cells (Fig.
2B). Taken together, these data suggest a favorable therapeutic
index between normal and cancer cells. Colony formation assays
further conﬁrmed that NSC59984 was toxic toward cancer cells.
Thus, NSC59984 signiﬁcantly reduced colony numbers in cancer
cells (Fig. 2C). We also examined cleaved PARP as a hallmark of
caspase-3–dependent cell death in cells treated with NSC59984
for 30 hours. As shown in Fig. 2D, NSC59984 increased PARP
cleavage in cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, but PARP
cleavage was not observed in normal cells at the same doses. On
the basis of these ﬁndings, we conclude that NSC59984 induces
cell death in cancer cells but displays little or no cytotoxicity
toward normal cells at the doses tested.
To determine whether NSC59984 has chemical genotoxicity
that may be involved in cell death and p53 pathway restoration,
we examined the level of gH2AX, a marker of genotoxicity due to

www.aacrjournals.org

DNA double-strand breaks (22). No gH2AX was found in SW480
and DLD-1 cancer cells treated with NSC59984 within 16 hours,
even at high concentrations of 50 mmol/L (Fig. 2E–G). These data
suggest that NSC59984 has little or no genotoxicity at the doses
that effectively kill mutant p53-expressing cancer cells. We
observed an increase of gH2AX in HCT116 cells at 8 hours after
12 mmol/L of NSC59984 treatment.
NSC59984 induces mutant p53 protein degradation through
MDM2-mediated ubiquitination in cancer cells
Given that NSC59984 restores p53 pathway signaling specifically in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells, we hypothesized that
mutant p53 was the molecular target in NSC59984-treated cancer
cells. NSC59984 treatment downregulated various mutant p53
proteins in a dose-dependent manner in SW480, DLD-1, Hop92
(mutant p53 R175L), and RXF393 cells (mutant p53 R175H;
Fig. 3A). In contrast, wild-type p53 protein was upregulated
in MRC-5 normal cells treated with 50 mmol/L of NSC59984

(Fig. 3B) as well as in HCT116 cancer cells treated with 25 and
50 mmol/L of NSC59984 (Fig. 3C). The upregulation of wildtype p53 protein was correlated with the increase of gH2AX
(Fig. 2F) in HCT116 cells treated with NSC59984. These results
suggest that NSC59984 speciﬁcally downregulates the mutant
p53 protein. Neither cleaved PARP (Fig. 3), nor sub-G1 DNA
content was increased in Hop92 and SW480 cells treated with 25
and 50 mmol/L of NSC59984 (Supplementary Fig. S1) in the
context of reduced mutant p53 protein expression. Increasing
dose of NSC59984 (50 mmol/L) slightly increased sub-G1 DNA
content to 8.7% and 8.2% from 4.5% and 5.8% of DMSO
treatment in RXF393 and DLD-1 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). At this dose, 25% to 50% of total mutant p53 protein
was degraded in DLD-1 and RXF393 cells treated with NSC59984
(Fig. 3A). Taken together, these results suggest that cell death is
not a signiﬁcant mechanism by which NSC59984 reduces mutant
p53. Thus, these results exclude the possibility of cell death as a
major mechanism for the NSC59984-mediated depletion of
mutant p53 protein.
Ubiquitination is a major mechanism by which p53 protein
stability is regulated (23). We treated mutant p53-expressing
cancer cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. MG132 treatment rescued the NSC59984-mediated downregulation of
mutant p53 (Fig. 4A). Moreover, we detected increased ubiquitination of mutant p53 in cancer cells treated with NSC59984 and
MG132 (Fig. 4C). Taken together, our results suggest that
NSC59984 causes mutant p53 protein ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. To further determine whether p53 transcription contributes to the NSC59984-mediated decrease of
mutant p53, we examined the mRNA level of mutant p53 in
SW480 cancer cells. We found that p53 mRNA was not decreased
in SW480 cells at 3 hours or at 16 hours of continuous NSC59984
treatment as compared with the DMSO control (Fig. 4D). These

3846 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

results taken together suggest that the effect of NSC59984 on
decrease of mutant p53 protein occurs mostly at the posttranslational level.
To investigate the role of MDM2 in NSC59984-mediated
mutant p53 protein degradation, we treated mutant p53-expressing cancer cells with nutlin-3, an MDM2 inhibitor. Nutlin-3
treatment partially rescued the NSC59984-induced decrease in
mutant p53 (Fig. 4B). We further found that mutant p53 was
phosphorylated at Thr55 and MDM2 was phosphorylated at
Ser166 in response to NSC59984 treatment in SW480 cells
(Fig. 4A and B). Both phosphorylation of p53 at Thr55 and
phosphorylation of MDM2 at Ser166 are important protein
modiﬁcations that allow p53 degradation via MDM2 (24, 25).
Taken together, these results suggest that NSC59984 induces
mutant p53 protein degradation, in part, through an MDM2mediated proteasomal mechanism.
To determine whether there is a wild-type conformational shift
in p53 after NSC59984 treatment of mutant p53-expressing
cancer cells, we examined the wild-type p53 protein in RXF393
(p53 R175L) cells using the Pab1620 antibody. p53 R175L is a
mutant that has been previously examined after exposure of p53mutant conformation modifying agents (7). However, immunohistochemistry revealed no staining with Pab1620 in RXF393 cells
before or after NSC59984 treatment. Immunoprecipitation assays
further conﬁrmed that no p53 protein bound with the Pab1620
antibody in RXF393 cell treated with NSC59984 (Supplementary
Fig. S2). These results do not support a conformational shift
toward wild-type of mutant p53 in cells after NSC59984 treatment, and they also exclude the possibility that mutant p53
degradation is due to a wild-type p53 conformational change.
Our results suggest that NSC59984 speciﬁcally induces mutant
p53 protein degradation, at least in part, via the MDM2-mediated
degradation through the ubiquitin–proteasome pathway.

NSC59984 restores p53 pathway signaling through activation
of p73
It is possible that mutant p53 degradation leads to the release of
p73 from their mutual complex. Therefore, we hypothesized that
p73 function may be stimulated in NSC59984-treated cancer cells
as a mechanism to restore p53 pathway signaling. To address this
issue, we examined the effect of NSC59984 on the p53 pathway in
mutant p53-expressing tumor cells in which p73 was either overexpressed by adenovirus infection or constitutively knocked down
by shRNA. NSC59984 treatment signiﬁcantly increased p53responsive bioluminescence interestingly to much higher levels
in the p73-overexpressing SW480 cells than in the wild-type p53overexpressing SW480 cells (Fig. 5A). The NSC59984-induced
p53-responsive bioluminescence was abrogated by knockdown
of p73 (Fig. 5B). We consistently observed that NSC59984-mediated upregulation of endogenous of p21, Puma, DR5, and Noxa
proteins was reduced by p73 knockdown (Fig. 5C). However, a
small amount of p21 protein induction was still observed in p73
knockdown DLD-1 cells treated with 25 mmol/L of NSC59984
(Fig. 5C). NSC59984 was found to upregulate p21 expression at
the protein level in HCT116 cells (Fig. 1). It is possible that p21
expression is regulated at transcriptional and protein levels in DLD1 cells in which mRNA and protein levels of p21 were increased in
response to NSC59984, although we believe only the transcriptional effects are p53-dependent (Fig. 1). Thus, knockdown of p73
only partially inhibited the NSC59984-mediated increase of p21
protein in DLD-1 cells (Fig. 5C). Taken together, these results
indicate that p73 appears to be required for NSC59984 to restore
the p53 pathway in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells.

induced cell death. NSC59984 treatment synergized with exogenous p73 to reduce cell viability in DLD-1 cancer cells (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, cell viability in p73
knockdown DLD-1 cells was found to be higher than those in
DLD-1 cells after NSC59984 treatment (Fig. 6B). FACS assays
revealed that the percentage of cells with sub-G1 content was
increased by NSC59984; however, the effect of NSC59984 was
signiﬁcantly reduced by knockdown of p73 (Fig. 6C), suggesting
that deﬁciency of p73 rescues cells from NSC59984-induced
apoptosis. Consistent with these observations, NSC59984induced PARP cleavage was partially abrogated by knockdown
of p73 in DLD-1 cells at 24 hours of NSC59984 treatment (Fig.
6D). Taken together, these results suggest that NSC59984 induces
p73-dependent cell death in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells.
CPT11 is a DNA-damaging agent used as cancer therapy in the
clinic to treat colorectal cancer. CPT11 treatment has been
reported to increase p73 protein levels in cancer cells (15). To
test whether NSC59984 mediates the cellular sensitivity to conventional chemotherapy, the combination of NSC59984 and
CPT11 was applied to cancer cells and normal human ﬁbroblast
cells. There was synergic activity of combinational treatment with
NSC59984 and CPT11 in SW480 colon cancer cells as well as in
normal ﬁbroblast MRC5 and Wi38 cells (Supplementary Table
S2). Cell viability assay showed that combinational treatment
with NSC59984 and CPT11 signiﬁcantly reduced cell viability in
SW480 cancer cells as compared with those in MRC5 and Wi38
normal cells (Fig. 6E).

tested dose. NSC59984 treatment signiﬁcantly repressed DLD-1
xenograft tumor growth as compared with the DMSO control
(Fig. 7A). We further measured tumor weight at day 15. Tumor
weight was reduced by 34% with NSC59984 treatment in DLD-1
xenograft tumors, suggesting the NSC59984 suppresses tumor
growth (P < 0.05; Fig. 7C). In contrast, we did not observe tumor
growth suppression in p73 knockdown DLD-1 xenograft tumors
in response to NSC59984 at the same dose (Fig. 7B). NSC59984
treatment reduced tumor weight by 18% in p73 knockdown DLD1 xenograft tumors (Fig. 7C). These results further conﬁrm our
observation in vitro that p73 is required for NSC59984 to induce
tumor cell death in DLD-1 cells.

Discussion
Most small molecular weight compounds targeting mutant p53
in cancer therapy do so by either restoring the p53 pathway or by
abolishing mutant p53 to remove GOF. Here, we report a smallmolecule NSC59984 that not only speciﬁcally restores the p53
pathway through p73 but also depletes mutant p53 protein in
mutant p53-expressing cancer cells.
There are several thousand mutations of p53 that have been
reported in human cancer (26). Most small molecules restoring
the p53 pathway have been identiﬁed and tested against a
certain mutation of p53. For example, identiﬁcation of Phikan083 was based on the Y222C mutation (27), SCH529074
was based on N268R mutation (28), PRIMA-1 was based on the

3848 Cancer Res; 75(18) September 15, 2015

mutations at residues 273 and 175 (6), and NSC-319726 was
based on R175H mutation (7). Therefore, it has remained a
challenge to develop universal p53-restoring drugs.
In our study, we demonstrate that NSC59984 causes degradation of multiple mutant p53 proteins in a variety of human
cancer cell lines (Fig. 3A), suggesting the versatility of
NSC59984 to target various mutants. Importantly, NSC59984
speciﬁcally targets mutant p53 and the restoration of the p53
pathway in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells, although it
appears to have p53 pathway-independent effects in other
tumor cell lines, that is, p21 upregulation, which may suppress
their growth. We found that NSC59984 treatment leads to the
degradation of mutant p53, but not wild-type p53 protein.
Wild-type p53 protein was upregulated by NSC59984 at high
doses in normal cells and cancer cells (Fig. 3B and C). We
documented a corresponding effect of NSC59984 to speciﬁcally
restore the p53 pathway in mutant p53-expressing colorectal
cancer cells, but not reactivation of the p53 pathway in tumor
cells with wild-type p53 or restoration of the p53 pathway in
those that are p53-null. This conclusion is based on our ﬁndings that: (i) NSC59984 increased p53-Luc reporter bioluminescence only in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells SW480
and DLD-1; (ii) expression of the p53 target genes p21, Puma,
DR5, and Noxa was signiﬁcantly upregulated at the mRNA and
the protein levels by NSC59984 in mutant p53-expressing
cancer cells SW480 and DLD-1 as compared with those in
wild-type p53-expressing HCT116 and p53-null HCT116

(Fig. 1); (iii) NSC59984 signiﬁcantly increased p53-responsive
bioluminescence to much greater levels in p73-overexpressing
SW480 cells than in p53-overexpressing SW480 cancer cells
(Fig. 5A). These data suggest the speciﬁcity of NSC59984 for
targeting p53 mutant in cancer. The speciﬁcity and versatility of
NSC59984 for targeting mutant p53 indicates that NSC59984
is a promising small-molecule drug candidate for further development through targeting restoration of the p53 pathway, in
part, through degradation of the mutant p53 protein.
The mutant p53 protein level is high in tumor cells due to its
stabilization (4). Stabilization of mutant p53 is mostly due to the
inability of mutant p53 to interact with MDM2, an E3 ubiquitin
ligase (3). Our data demonstrate that NSC59984 induces mutant
p53 protein degradation via MDM2-mediated ubiquitination
and proteasomal degradation (Fig. 4). Another compound,
NSC319726, provided a model for the wild-type conformational
change from mutant p53 to be sequentially degraded through
MDM2-mediated ubiquitination (7). However, we did not ﬁnd a
wild-type p53 conformational change in tumor cells treated with
NSC59984 (Supplementary Fig. S2) or downregulation of wildtype p53 protein by NSC59984 treatment (Fig. 3B and C). These
results suggest that NSC59984 mediates the downregulation of
p53 due to mutant p53 degradation rather than restoration of a
less stable wild-type p53 protein.
Hsp90 and Hsp70 are two molecular chaperones that stabilize
mutant p53 protein by affecting the MDM2-mediated turnover of
mutant p53 (29). Thus, mutant p53 escapes from MDM2-mediated degradation, and there are lower levels of MDM2 in mutant
p53-expressing cells due to reduced transactivation of the MDM2
gene by p53 (3). Inhibition of Hsp90 has been shown to destabilize mutant p53 through MDM2 activity (9, 10). It remained
unclear whether NSC59984 induces mutant p53 protein degradation through disturbing the MDM2–Hsp chaperone axis. A

conformational change of mutant p53 is another possible mechanism of mutant p53 degradation by NSC59984. For example,
CP31398 induces a wild-type conformational change in mutant
p53 by modifying the unfolded mutant p53 (5). PRIMA-1 causes a
conformational change by forming adducts with thiols in the
mutant p53 core domain (30). Although NSC59984 did not
restore a wild-type p53 conformation, it is possible that
NSC59984 converts the mutant p53 structure to one more amenable to the MDM2-mediated ubiquitination to regulate mutant
p53 degradation. We found phosphorylation of mutant p53 at
Thr55 and phosphorylation of MDM2 at Ser166 in SW480 cancer
cells treated with NSC59984 (Fig. 4). Phosphorylation of p53 at
Thr55 and phosphorylation of MDM2 at Ser166 have been
reported to contribute to p53 protein ubiquitination (24, 25).
Our results suggest a possibility that NSC59984 induces mutant
p53 and MDM2 protein modiﬁcations that contribute to mutant
p53 protein degradation. It remains unclear how mutant p53 and
MDM2 are phosphorylated by signaling pathways stimulated by
NSC59984 in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells.
Mutant p53 protein degradation is an effective means to
remove its GOF, resulting in release of p73 and other factors
from inhibitory complexes with mutant p53. However, many
mutant p53 protein targeting small molecules, such as HDACI
and 17AAG, do not restore the p53 pathway (10, 31). Unlike these
mutant p53-targeting agents, NSC59984 not only degrades
mutant p53 protein to release p73, but also induces p73-dependent p53 restoration (Figs. 1 and 5). It is possible that NSC59984
converts the released p73 to an active form or stabilizes p73.
Active p73 functions as a transcription factor to upregulate p53
target genes such as p21, puma, and DR5. We found that
NSC59984 signiﬁcantly induces p73-dependent p53 restoration
only in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells (Figs. 1 and 5), but not
in p53-null or wild-type p53-expressing HCT116 cells that

contain wild-type p73 (Fig. 1). These results suggest that restoration of the p53 pathway occurs, at least in part, through the release
of p73 in mutant p53-expressing tumor cells. The fraction of
released and active p73 could be increased by mutant p53
degradation. We did not ﬁnd increased p73 protein levels in the
mutant p53-expressing tumor cells treated with NSC59984 at 8
hours by Western blot assay using anti-p73 antibody (Bethyl
Laboratories Inc.). It is possible that posttranslational modiﬁcations of p73 protein are induced by NSC59984, and that such
NSC59984-mediated modiﬁcations interrupt the anti-p73 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.) recognizing modiﬁed p73 protein. We found that NSC59984 signiﬁcantly enhanced p73dependent p53-responsive reporter bioluminescence in the
p73-overexpressing cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting that active p73 is
involved in NSC59984-mediated p53 restoration. p73 activity is
regulated by complex posttranslational modiﬁcations and protein–protein interactions (14). The mechanism by which
NSC59984 activates the released p73 remains to be further
elucidated. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that p73 is required
for NSC59984 to induce cell death in addition to restoring p53
pathway. We found that knockdown of p73 not only rescues cells
from apoptosis induced by NSC59984 in vitro (Fig. 6), but also
prevents the NSC59984-mediated suppression of xenograft
tumor growth in vivo (Fig. 7). Although mutant p53 deletion has
been reported to be sufﬁcient to induce cell death (10, 31), our
ﬁndings suggest that NSC59984-induced cell death is p73-dependent in mutant p53-expressing cancer cells. Activation of p73 is an
important step for p73-induced cell death (14). How active p73
regulates cell death in response to NSC59984 treatment will be
further investigated in the future. Because p73 is required for both
NSC59984-mediated p53 restoration and cell death, it is possible
that NSC59984 induces cell death via p73-dependent restoration
of the p53 pathway. Therefore, NSC59984 offers a rational bypass

mechanism of p53 restoration via the activation of p73 to kill
cancer cells. On the basis of our ﬁndings, we provide a model for
NSC59984 working in cancer cells (Fig. 7E). NSC59984 releases
p73 from the inhibitory complex of mutant p53 by degrading
mutant p53. The released p73 may be further converted to the
active form by NSC59984. Active p73 then restores the p53
pathway. NSC59984-mediated p53 restoration and/or active
p73 together with depletion of GOF may result in tumor suppression (Fig. 7E).
NSC59984 induces cell death in mutant p53-expressing cancer
cells with minimal genotoxicity. Importantly, we did not ﬁnd
cytotoxicity of NSC59984 against normal cells at the doses tested
(Fig. 2), suggesting the safety of NSC59984 administration for
cancer therapy. Indeed, in vivo experiments demonstrate that i.p.
injection of NSC59984 suppresses xenograft tumor growth (Fig. 7),
but was not toxic toward animals, suggesting that NSC59984 may
be further evaluated for clinical development. Mutant p53 protein
degradation releases many factors, including p73, from the mutant
p53 protein complex (4), which might result in p73 independent
off-target effects. Because of the speciﬁcity of NSC59984 for mutant
p53, the potential off-target effects may be limited in mutant p53expressing cells and may not affect normal cells containing wildtype p53. However, the antitumor effect of NSC59984 on cancer
cells is not limited in p53-mutant cancer cells (Fig. 2). We noted
that NSC59984 induced cell apoptosis in wild-type p53-expressing
as well as p53-null cancer cells, suggesting that the cell death
induced by NSC59984 in these cell lines is p53-independent. It
is possible there may be tumor-suppressive effects due to
NSC59984-mediated upregulation of p21 protein in these two
cell lines (Fig. 1). Our ﬁndings suggest that NSC59984 regulates
p21 expression at the posttranslational level in HCT116 and p53null HCT116 cancer cells. p21 regulation at the posttranslational
level could be an off-target effect of NSC59984 in cancer cells, and

Therapeutic Rescue of p53 Deﬁciency in Human Cancer

may involve effects of NSC59984 on MDM2 in a p53-independent
manner that remains to be further unraveled.
p73 is an important determinant of chemosensitivity. In
response to cellular stresses and DNA damage, p73 is activated
through different signaling pathways and enhances chemosensitivity (14, 15). However, mutant p53 inhibits p73 activation,
resulting in drug resistance. Our ﬁnding that NSC59984 rescues
p73 activity to restore the p53 pathway provides a potential
application of NSC59984 to reduce chemoresistance. Indeed,
NSC59984 synergizes with CPT11 to suppress colorectal cancer
cell growth (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Table S2). Therefore,
NSC59984 warrants further evaluation in combination therapy to
reduce the dose of CPT11 required for growth suppression in
colorectal cancer. Combinatorial treatment with NSC59984 may
minimize the side effects of CPT11 chemotherapy and increase its
antitumor effects in colorectal cancer patients. Taken together, these
results demonstrate that NSC59984 is a candidate therapeutic as
both a single agent or in combination with conventional chemotherapy. On the basis of the ﬁndings of this study, we conclude that
NSC59984 is a promising drug candidate that speciﬁcally targets
mutant p53 via a mechanism involving both mutant p53 depletion
and p73-dependent p53 pathway restoration.
