Summary

Author Manuscript

Epigenetic silencing including histone modifications and DNA methylation is an important
1
tumorigenic mechanism However, its role in cancer immunopathology and immunotherapy is
poorly understood. Using ovarian cancers as our model, we found that enhancer of zeste homolog
2 (EZH2)-mediated histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) and DNA methyltransferase
(DNMT) 1-mediated DNA methylation repress the tumor production of Th1-type chemokines
CXCL9 and CXCL10, and subsequently determine effector T cell trafficking to the tumor
microenvironment. Treatment with epigenetic modulators removes the repression and increases
effector T cell tumor infiltration, slows down tumor progression, and improves therapeutic efficacy

Moreover, tumor EZH2 and DNMT1 are negatively associated with tumor infiltrating CD8+ T
cells and patient outcome. Thus, epigenetic silencing of Th1-type chemokine is a novel tumor

immune evasion mechanism. Selective epigenetic reprogramming alters T cell landscape in
cancer and may enhance clinical efficacy of cancer therapy.

Cancer immunotherapy has demonstrated therapeutic responses , , , . Yet, the objective
responses have been manifested in a fraction of patients. We hypothesized that immune
protective signature genes might be epigenetically silenced in cancer and in turn affect
cancer progression and clinical responses to immunotherapy. Cancer epigenetic silencing
often includes EZH2-mediated histone modifications and DNMT mediated-DNA
9
methylation. DZNep is an inhibitor of all SAM dependent enzymes including EZH2 and
10
EPZ6438 may specifically inhibit EZH2. 5-aza-2′deoxycytidine (5-AZA dC) is a DNMT
inhibitor. Hence, we used these agents to reprogram epigenetic pathways and to test our
hypothesis.

In the first setting, we established ID8 ovarian cancer in C57/BL6 mice and treated them
with low doses of DZNep and EPZ6438, 5-AZA dC and their combination. Treatment with
single agent had minimal effects on tumor volume, whereas the combinatorial treatment
caused tumor reduction, increased tumor infiltrating T cells and Th1-type chemokine
expression (Extended Data Fig. 1a–e). We observed similar tumor volume (Extended Data
11
Fig. 1f) in ID8 bearing, female NOD-scid IL2Rγnull (NSG) mice , that received identical
treatment. Thus, epigenetic reprograming elicits potent tumor immunity and blocks cancer
progression.
We have demonstrated the relevance of the inhibitory B7-H1 (PD-L1) signaling blockade in
23
human cancer , . In the second setting, we tested the role of DZNep and 5-AZA dC in antitumor immunity elicited by PD-L1 blockade. We observed reduced tumor volume in mice
treated with anti-PD-L1 or DZNep plus 5-AZA dC. The combination reduced tumor volume,
increased tumor infiltrating CD8+ T cells and Th1-type chemokine expression (Extended
Data Fig. 1g–i). Thus, changes in epigenetic program can augment therapeutic efficacy of
PD-L1 blockade therapy.

In the third setting, we examined the effects of these two epigenetic modulators on adoptive
T cell therapy in our NSG model. We established human ovarian cancer in NSG mice and
12 14
generated tumor associated antigen (TAA)-specific CD8+ T cells – . Then, the NSG mice
were treated with DZNep and 5-AZA dC, and/or TAA-specific CD8+ T cells. In the absence
of TAA-specific T cells, treatment with DZNep and 5-AZA dC had minimal effects on
tumor progression. TAA-specific CD8+ T cells reduced tumor volume (Extended Data Fig.
1j). Consequently, treatment with DZNep and 5-AZA dC improved the therapeutic efficacy
of T cell therapy, and elevated Th1-type chemokine expression, and tumor effector T cells

(Extended Data Fig. 1j–l). GSK126 is a selective inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase
15
activity . We use GSK126 in the human T cell therapy setting. Treatment with low doses
of GSK126 and/or 5-AZA dC had no effect on tumor growth in the absence of T cell
transfusion (Extended Data Fig. 1m). Treatment with GSK126 and 5-AZA dC
synergistically improved the therapeutic efficacy of T cell therapy (Fig. 1a, Extended Data
Fig. 1m), increased tumor CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression (Fig. 1b, c), and CD8+ T cell
infiltration (Fig. 1d, e, Extended Data Fig. 1n), and had minimal effects on TNFα and IFNγ
expression (Extended Data Fig. 1o–q). Administration of anti-human CXCR3 abrogated the
role of GSK126 and 5-AZA dC treatment in tumor progression (Fig. 1a), and blocked T cell
tumor trafficking (Fig. 1d, e), and had no effect on T cell apoptosis (Extended Data Fig. 1r,
s). CXCR3+CD8+ T cells were in spleen (Extended Data Fig. 1t) and blood (Fig. 1e) with or
without anti-CXCR3 treatment. To determine the major source of Th-1 type chemokine, we
isolated human tumor and immune cells from tumor tissues in the NSG mice (Fig. 1a–e). We
found that administration of GSK126 and 5-AZA dC increased tumor CXCL10 expression
with or without T cell transfusion (Fig. 1f). Regardless of the treatment, the levels of
CXCL10 expression were higher in tumor than immune cells (Fig. 1f). We extended our
studies to tumor and immune cells from ovarian cancer patients. Although EZH2 may

regulates naïve CD4+ T cell IFNγ expression , GSK126 and 5-AZA dC treatment
increased CXCL10 production by tumor, not by T cells (Fig. 1g), and tumor cells produced
higher levels of CXCL10 than immune cells (Fig. 1g). Thus, epigenetic reprograming may
predominantly target tumor Th1-type chemokine expression.

Next, we investigated how epigenetic modulators regulate tumor Th1-type chemokine
expression. We initially examined the effect of DZNep on Th1-type chemokine expression
in primary human ovarian cancer cells in response to IFNγ treatment. DZNep promoted
CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA and protein expression (Extended Data Fig. 2a–c), and had no
effect on IFNγ receptor (IFNGR2) (Extended Data Fig. 2d). We tested two inhibitors of
histone H3 lysine 9 methyltransferase G9a, BIX01294 and UNC0638. The inhibition of G9a
had no effects on the Th1-type chemokine expressions (Extended Data Fig. 2e). Thus,
methylation of H3K27 may mediate Th1-type chemokine repression in cancer.

EZH2 is the catalytic subunit of the H3K27 methyltransferase complex , . DZNep
treatment caused the reduction of EZH2 protein and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) in
primary ovarian cancer cells (Extended Data Fig. 2f). Similarly, EPZ6438 reduced
H3K27me3 expression and increased CXCL9 expression in mouse ID8 cells (Extended Data
Fig. 2g, h). We genetically knocked down human EZH2 expression with lentivirus-based
short hairpin RNA for EZH2 (shEZH2). shEZH2 reduced the expression of EZH2 and
H3K27me3 (Extended Data Fig. 2i), and resulted in elevated Th1-type chemokine mRNA
and protein expression (Fig. 2a, b), and no change in IFNGR2 and HLA-B (Extended Data
Fig. 2j, k). Thus, EZH2 and its histone methyltransferase activity mediate Th1-type
chemokine repression in primary ovarian cancer cells.
We tested whether EZH2 mediated Th1-type chemokine repression depends on H3K27me3
changes at the promoter level. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay revealed that
IFNγ treatment reduced H3K27me3 levels on the promoters of CXCL9 and CXCL10
(Extended Data Fig. 2l, m). DZNep (Extended Data Fig. 2l, m) and shEZH2 (Fig. 2c) largely

removed H3K27me3 occupancy on the promoters of CXCL9 and CXCL10, and
subsequently increased IFNγ-induced chemokine gene expressions (Fig. 2a, b). As a positive
control, shEZH2 reduced H3K27me3 occupancy on the promoter of HOXB1 gene
18
(Extended Data Fig. 2n) . Thus, H3K27me3 removal results in the abrogation of the Th1type chemokine gene silencing in primary ovarian cancer.

GSK126 is a selective inhibitor of EZH2 methyltransferase activity . GSK126 treatment
abolished the global level of H3K27me3 without inhibiting EZH2 (Extended Data Fig. 3a,
b), IFNGR2 expression and cell survival (Extended Data Fig. 3c, d). GSK126 treatment led
to higher levels of IFNγ-induced Th1-type chemokine expression in two primary and three
established ovarian cancer cell lines (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 3e–h). JmjC-domain18
containing protein, JMJD3 is an H3K27 specific demethylase . Ectopic expression of
JMJD3 reduced H3K27me3 (Extended Data Fig. 3i), and increased Th1-type chemokine
expression (Fig. 2e, Extended Data Fig. 3j), and had no effect on HLA-B and IFNGR
expression (Extended Data Fig. 3k, l). JMJD3 deficiency introduced by a shJMJD3 inhibited
CXCL10 (Fig. 2f), but not IFNGR expression (Extended Data Fig. 3m).
GSK-J4, a catalytic site inhibitor, may target H3K27-specific JmjC demethylase
19
subfamily . GSK-J4 treatment increased H3K27me3 (Extended Data Fig. 3n) and reduced
CXCL9 and CXCL10 expression (Fig. 2g), had no effects on H3K4me1, H3K4me2 and
H3K4me3 and IFNGR expression (Extended Data Fig. 3n, o).

Author Manuscript

To define the gene profile altered by EZH2 and H3K27me3 in response to IFNγ, we
performed several microarrays in primary ovarian cancer cells transfected with shEZH2,
control, or treated with GSK126 and medium. We found that 155 and 124 genes were altered
by shEZH2 and GSK126 treatment, respectively, and 20 genes were increased or decreased
by both shEZH2 and GSK126 treatment. CXCL9 and CXCL10 were at the top 1 and 3
positions among the increased genes in the arrays (Fig. 2h). Altogether, the data indicate that
H3K27me3 specific methyltransferase and demethylase preferentially and predominantly
regulate Th1-type chemokine repression in primary ovarian cancer cells.

DNA methylation regulates gene expression through DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). We
treated two primary and one established ovarian cancer cell line with 5-AZA dC. 5-AZA dC
treatment increased CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 3a–c,
Extended Data Fig. 4a–d). IRF1 and IFNGR were not affected by 5-AZA dC treatment
(Extended Data Fig. 4e, f). Specific knockdown of DNMT1 (Extended Data Fig. 4g)
increased CXCL9 and CXCL10 mRNA and protein (Fig. 3d–f), but had no effects on
IFNGR2 (Extended Data Fig. 4h). To demonstrate DNA methylation status in the CXCL10
locus, we carried out bisulfite genomic sequencing on the CXCL10 gene locus and analyzed
the methylation at the CXCL10 gene loci containing STAT1 binding site (Fig. 3g, Extended
Data 4i). The genomic location of bisulfite sequencing was at 5′ upstream of the CXCL10
gene promoter (−5 kb to −4.7 kb). 5-AZA dC treatment reduced DNA methylation of the
CXCL10 gene locus (Fig. 3g). Thus, DNA methylation regulates Th1-type chemokine
expression.

We examined the relationship between EZH2/H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the
regulation of chemokine expression. We treated primary ovarian cancer cells with 5-AZA
dC or GSK126, and found that 5-AZA dC reduced DNMT1 expression but had no effects on
H3K27me3 and H3K9me2, whereas GSK126 reduced H3K27me3 expression but had no
effects on DNMT1 expression (Fig. 4a). Thus, DNA methylation and EZH2/H3K27me3
histone modification may not reciprocally regulate at the protein levels in primary ovarian
cancer. We explored whether EZH2/H3K27me3 and DNA methylation could independently
mediate the Th1-type chemokine repression. We examined the effects of 5-AZA dC on
shEZH2 cells, and observed that 5-AZA dC enhanced CXCL10 expression (Fig. 4b).
Similarly, GSK126 increased CXCL10 expression in shDNMT1 cells (Fig. 4c). Primary
ovarian cancer cells released higher levels of CXCL10 in the combinatorial treatment of
DZNep and 5-AZA dC compared to either treatment alone (Fig. 4d). The data suggest that
H3K27me3 and DNA methylation can independently repress tumor Th1-type chemokine
expression.

We studied the interaction between EZH2 and DNMT1 in the ovarian cancer
microenvironment and its clinical relevance (Extended Data Table 1). We quantified the
nuclear levels of EZH2 and DNMT1 (Extended Data Fig. 5a, b) via immunohistochemistry
11
in human ovarian cancer tissues by the H-score method and analyzed their impact on
patient survival (Extended Data Table 1). Based on the median values of EZH2 and DNMT1
intensity, we divided patients into “low” and “high” groups. Overall survival (OS) and
disease free-interval (DFI) (Extended Data Table 1) were shorter in patients with high levels
of EZH2 (Fig. 4e, Extended Data Fig. 5c) and DNMT1 (Fig. 4f, Extended Data Fig. 5d)
compared to patients with low levels of these marks. After adjusting for the prognostic
clinical factors, OS and DFI remained shorter in patients with high EZH2 and DNMT1
expression (Extended Data Table 2). Tumor EZH2 and DNMT1 were positive predictors of
death hazard in univariate (Extended Data Table 1) and multivariate analyses (Extended Data
Table 2). The reduced OS and DFI were more pronounced in the combination of high levels
of EZH2 and DNMT1 than EZH2 or DNMT1 alone (Extended Data Table 3).

Author Manuscript

To estimate the performance of EZH2 and DNMT1 on predicting survival, we used the time20
dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis . The area under the
ROC curve (AUC) is calculated to evaluate the predictive accuracy of each marker for
estimating survival. The analysis revealed similar AUCs for EZH2 and DNMT1 in
predicting OS and DFI (Fig. 4g, Extended Data Fig. 5e and Table 4). The expression of
EZH2 and DNMT1 may be equally important in ovarian cancer pathology. Next, we
evaluated significance of the two parameters for ovarian cancer survival. Given the negative
and independent impact of EZH2 and DNMT1, we reasoned that both parameters are more
efficient at predicting survival than individually. Indeed, EZH2highDNMT1high patients
experienced a shorter OS and DFI (Extended Data Table 3) than EZH2lowDNMT1low
patients in univariate and multivariate analysis (Fig. 4h). Patients with mixed patterns had
similar and moderate survival (Fig 4h, Extended Data Fig. 5f). Thus, the combination of
EZH2 and DNMT1 allows for improved prognostic stratification of ovarian cancer survival
as compared to EZH2 or DNMT1 alone. Next, we quantified intratumoral CD8+ T cells by
immunohistochemistry (Extended Data Fig. 5g), and found that there was a correlation
between tumor CD8+ T cell content and survival (Extended Data Table 1, 2). We divided the

patients into two groups based on the median values of CD8+ T cell number. Patients with
the higher CD8+ T cells experienced longer OS and DFI compared to those with fewer
21 22
CD8+ T cell group , (Fig. 4i, Extended Data Fig. 5h). ROC curve analysis revealed
similar power of CD8+ T cells in predicting OS (Fig. 4g) and DFI (Extended Data Fig. 5e).
Finally, we observed that the levels of EZH2 (Fig. 4j) and DNMT1 (Fig. 4k) were inversely
associated with CD8+ T cells, respectively. The accumulating levels of EZH2 and DNMT1
negatively correlated with intratumoral CD8+ T cells (Fig. 4l). Altogether, the results
suggest that tumors co-opt certain epigenetic pathway, silence Th1-type chemokine
expression and repress T cell tumor homing, which functions as a novel immune evasion
mechanism.

Patients diagnosed with high grade serous ovarian carcinomas were recruited for this study.
Human subject use in this study was approved by the local Institutional Review Boards and
the informed consents were obtained from the patients. We collected 186 formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded ovarian tumor tissue blocks (Extended Data Table 1) and 20 fresh
2 12 31
ovarian cancer tissues for this study as described previously , , . After pathological
11,32
review, a tissue microarray (TMA)
was constructed from the most representative area
of paraffin-embedded ovarian tumor tissue. For each tumor, a minimum of two
representative tumor areas were selected from a hematoxylin- and eosin-stained section of a
donor block. Core cylinders (1 mm) were punched from each of these areas and deposited
into a recipient paraffin block. Consecutive 6 μm-thick TMA sections were cut and placed
on charged Poly-L-Lysine-coated slides for immunohistochemistry analyses. Further
information regarding the TMA is described in the supplementary experimental procedures.
Epithelial cell adhesion molecule expressing (EpCAM+) primary tumor cells, CD14+CD45+
macrophages, CD3+CD45+ T cells, and CD45+ immune cells were isolated and sorted from
fresh ovarian cancer tissues for functional studies. Primary human ovarian cancer cell lines
(OC8 and OC17) were generated from fresh ovarian cancer tissues and/or ascites fluid in our
11 13 33
laboratory as previously described , , . Three commercialized ovarian cancer cell lines
A2780, CAOV3 and ES-2 were included in the study. The cell lines were routinely tested for
mycoplasma contamination. All the commercialized cell lines were authenticated by the

(ATCC, #HB-12330) by Hybridoma Core at the University of Michigan.
Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR and Microarray
RNA exacted with Trizol (Invitrogen) was used for cDNA synthesis with high capacity
cDNA reverse transcript kit (Applied Biosystems, 4374966). Real-time RT-PCR was
performed on the Eppendorf Realplex Real-Time PCR system or StepOne Plus Real-Time
PCR system (Life Technologies). The mRNA was quantified and normalized to the amount
of GAPDH. The specific primers used for Real-Time PCR are listed in the Extended Data
Table 5.

Gene expression microarray was carried out at the University of Michigan Microarray Core
Facility using Affymetrix Human Gene ST 2.1 Chip according to the standard protocol. Data
was analyzed by the University of Michigan Bioinformatics Core Facility. Two biological
replicates of each sample were prepared independently from primary human ovarian cancer
cells for gene expression profiling. Genes with >1.5 fold changes were selected for further
analysis.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)

ChIP assay was described previously , . Sonication was performed with the Misonix 4000
water bath sonication unit at 15% amplitude for 10 minutes. ChIP-enriched chromatin was
analyzed by Real-Time PCR with SYBR Green Master Mix, and normalized to the input.
The ChIP primers were listed in the Extended Data Table 5.

frozen ovarian cancer tissue sections was performed on a DAKO Autostainer (DAKO) using
DAKO LSAB+ and diaminobenzadine (DAB) as the chromogen. Serial sections of deparaffinized TMA sections were labeled with rabbit anti-human EZH2 antibody (Clone
ZMD.309, 18-7395, 1:200, Life Technologies), rabbit anti-DNMT1 (Clone H-300,
sc-20701, 1:50, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and mouse anti-human CD8 antibody (DAKO,
M7103). Cores from several normal organ tissues were used as tissue controls on each slide.

Author Manuscript

The cores were quantified and analyzed for the expression of EZH2 and DNMT1 with an
Aperio imaging system (Genetix) and for the numbers of intratumoral CD8+ T cells in 0.1
mm2 tumor. The specimens were digitalized with an automated platform (Aperio
Technologies) and ScanScope XT and Spectrum Plus using TMA software version 9.1
scanning system. Cores were scored in high resolution of 40X. Tissue sections were scored
manually on a computer screen, and a mean score for duplicate cores from each individual
was calculated. Any discrepancies were resolved by subsequent consultation with diagnostic
pathologists. Epigenetic marks, EZH2 and DNMT1 were localized in the nuclei, and were
11 32
scored using the H-score method , . The tissues were divided into high and low
epigenetic mark expression based on the median value of the expression level per core. The
H-score is a method of assessing the extent of nuclear immunoreactivity. The H score takes
into account the percentage of positive cells (0–100%) in each intensity category (0–3+) and
computes a final score, on a continuous scale between 0 and 300. The score is obtained by
the formula: 3 x percentage of strongly staining nuclei + 2 x percentage of moderately
11
staining nuclei + percentage of weakly staining nuclei, giving a range of 0 to 300 .
Staining with isotype antibody was used as negative control.

(Spearman correlation, denoted by r, for ordinal data and Pearson correlation, denoted by r,
for continuous data), together with a P-value (null hypothesis is that r is in fact zero), were
computed to measure the degree of association between biomarkers. Log-rank test was used
to compare time to tumor initiation between two groups. Overall patient survival was
defined as the time from date of diagnosis and to disease related death. Survival functions
were estimated by Kaplan-Meier methods.

Cox’s proportional hazards regression was performed to model survival as a function of
EZH2, DNMT1 and CD8+ T cells. The data were analyzed as continuous or categorized
values and classified as low and high based on the median values, or the combination of
EZH2 and DNMT1 (classified as EZH2highDNMT1high and EZH2lowDNMT1low), after
adjusting for age and stage. We assessed the adequacy of the Cox regression model.

Graphical and numerical methods were described . We used ROC analysis to evaluate
the predictive accuracy of the levels of EZH2 and DNMT1, and CD8+ T cells for 60 month
survivals. All analyses were done using SAS 9.3 software. P < 0.05 considered as
significant. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Sample size was
determined on the basis of animal experimental trials and in consideration of previous
publications on similar experiments to allow for confident statistical analyses. The
experiments were not randomized. The investigators were not blinded to allocation during
experiments and outcome assessment unless state differently.

Effects of GSK126 and 5-AZA dC on T cell immunotherapy. Ovarian cancer-bearing NSG
mice were treated with GSK126, 5-AZA dC and/or anti-CXCR3, and received TAA-specific
CD8+ T cell transfusion. Tumor volume (a), tumor chemokine expression (b, c), tumorinfiltrating T cells and blood T cells (d, e) were shown. CXCL10 transcript was quantified in
tumor and immune cells from tumor tissues in NSG model (f). Tumor and immune cells
(106/ml) were isolated from ovarian cancer from patients, and were treated for 48 hours in
the indicated conditions. CXCL10 protein was measured by ELISA (g) (mean/SD, n = 5, * P
< 0.05, Mann-Whitney Test).
