tive phase 2 study. All patients had received prior surgery, radiotherapy,
patients), and chemotherapy (hydroxyurea in 19 patients and other in 17
a dose of 10 million U/m2 administered subcutaneously every other day) was
initiated. A complete blood count and chemistry panel was obtained before every
cycle, and cranial magnetic resonance images were obtained every 3 months.

RESULTS. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities were fatigue (6 patients;
17%), anemia (3 patients; 8.6%), and leukopenia (3 patients; 8.6%) (toxicities
were graded according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common Toxicity Criteria [version 3.0]). Three patients went off study because of toxicity, and 7 patients
required a dose reduction. There were no treatment-related deaths or delays in
therapy reported. All patients were assessable for response. No patient demonstrated a neuroradiographic complete or partial response. Twenty-six patients
demonstrated stable disease after the first 3 cycles of interferon-a, and 9 patients
had progressive disease. The progression-free survival rate was 54% at 6 months
and 31% at 12 months. The median time to tumor progression was 7 months
(range, 2-24 months). The median survival was 8 months (range, 3-28 months).

CONCLUSIONS. Treatment with interferon-a for recurrent meningiomas was found
to be tolerated moderately well and was modestly effective. Cancer 2008;113:

eningiomas are extra-axial brain and spinal cord tumors that
occur in middle to late adult life and have a strong predominance among women.1-3 Most patients who are diagnosed with
meningioma undergo tumor resection to relieve neurologic symptoms.1,2 For incompletely resected or recurrent tumors that have not
been irradiated previously, radiotherapy is administered.4,5 When
the meningioma is unresectable and additional radiation is not feasible, chemotherapy may be considered.6-28 The current prospective
phase 2 study was undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of interferona (aIFN), an agent with purported antiproliferative, antimenin-

gioma, and antiangiogenic activity, in patients with
recurrent meningiomas who had previously failed
surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was performed at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles; the Moffitt Cancer
Center (Tampa, Fla); and the University of Massachusetts (Worcester, Mass). Approval of the protocol
and informed consent by the university Human
Investigation Committee was obtained. Informed
consent was obtained from each patient. The study
was initiated in January 2000 and was closed to
accrual in June 2007.

Eligibility Criteria
All patients must have had a histologically proven
World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningioma that was recurrent. Patients must have developed disease progression after radiotherapy. At least
6 months must have elapsed after the last radiotherapy. Patients may have received 1 or 2 prior chemotherapy regimens. Confirmation of pathology and
tumor grade was not required at the time of disease
recurrence. A Karnofsky performance status 60; a
life expectancy >3 months; and adequate hematologic, renal, and hepatic functions were required.
Drug Schedule
aIFN (Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals, Kenilworth.
NJ) was administered to all patients at a dose of 10
million U/m2 given subcutaneously every other
day.16-18,28 A cycle of therapy was defined as 4 weeks.
Treatment cycles were repeated every 4 weeks provided that all hematologic toxicity from the previous
cycle had resolved to grade 2 or less and that all
nonhematologic toxicity had resolved to grade 1 or
less. No dose escalations were permitted. Dose
reduction for toxicity was allowed in 25% increments.
All toxicities caused by aIFN therapy were rated
according to the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0).
Concurrent dexamethasone was permitted for
control of neurologic signs and symptoms. Oral
dexamethasone was used in 12 patients. In 7 of those
patients, the dose was increased because of disease
progression, which was demonstrated clinically and
neuroradiographically. In 5 patients, a stable dexamethasone dose was maintained.
Method of Evaluation
A complete blood count, chemistry panel, and neurologic examination were performed every 4 weeks.

2147

Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed every 12 weeks.
Standard neuroradiographic response criteria
were used.29 In patients who had stable disease (SD),
a partial response (PR,) or a complete response (CR),
3 additional cycles of aIFN were administered, and
the patients were reassessed. Patients continued on
aIFN therapy until they had documentation of PD, at
which time patients were removed from study. All
neuroradiology data were reviewed by the authors
and by 2 blinded neuroradiologists at the participating institution. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were defined as the time from
the first day of treatment until disease progression or
death.

Statistical Analysis
This was a prospective phase 2 study, and the primary objective was to estimate 6-month PFS from
the time of study entry. Secondary objectives
included the response rate, median survival, the median time to disease progression, and the frequency
of toxicity. On the basis of a review of the literature,
we determined that no greater than 10% of patients
of the type enrolled in this trial were likely to experience a 6-month PFS in response to any previously
published treatment regimens. Therefore, if the
chance of remaining alive and free of progression at
6 months was 10%, then there would be little interest in further investigation of aIFN at the study dose
and treatment schedule. However, if there was a
chance 40% that a patient would remain alive and
free of progression at 6 months, then there would be
substantial interest in the further study of aIFN. On
the basis of these clinical considerations, and using a
Bayesian single-threshold, 2-stage study design30,31
with a threshold probability at the first stage of 0.6
and a threshold probability at the second stage of
0.7, a maximum of 35 patients would need to be
accrued (14 patients in the first stage of the trial and
21 patients in the second stage of the trial). If 5
responses were observed during the first stage, then
the trial would be stopped. If 6 to 9 responses were
observed during the first stage, then an additional 21
patients would be accrued; and, if >9 responses were
observed during the first stage, then an additional 14
patients would be accrued. If a total of 15 responses
had occurred by the end of the trial, then further
investigation of aIFN would be warranted.

RESULTS
Thirty-five patients (29 women and 6 men) with a
median age of 61 years (age range, 36-88 years) were

enrolled (Table 1). After the initial accrual of 14
patients (6 patients with a PFS >6 months), 21 additional patients were added to the study. The Karnofsky performance status ranged from 60 to 100
(median, 80). All patients had World Health Organization (WHO) grade 1 meningiomas that were confirmed by histopathology and reconfirmed by repeat
craniotomy in 18 patients. All but 1 patient commenced aIFN after failure on previous chemotherapy
(hydroxyurea in 19 patients, other in 15 patients).
The start of aIFN after the last therapy ranged from
1 month to 9 months (median, 1 month). The median time to treatment with aIFN after the time of
the original surgery was 6.75 years (range, 2.75-14
years). Neurologic examination revealed hemispheric
dysfunction in 20 patients (hemiparesis in 14
patients, seizures in 10 patients, and aphasia in 2
patients), cranial neuropathy in 10 patients, and
ataxia in 5 patients. In all patients, cranial MRI
demonstrated disease progression by revealing an
increase >25% in tumor volume before study entry
(comparison MRI studies were obtained 2 months
apart). In the 22 patients who received previous stereotactic radiotherapy, reoperation confirmed recurrent meningioma in 13 patients. In the remaining 9
patients, tumor recurrence was defined by a combination of anatomic MRI, octreotide imaging, and
perfusion MRI studies. Prior treatments are listed in
Table 1.
In a total of 242 cycles of aIFN, there were 51
grade 2 toxicities, 12 grade 3 toxicities, and 2 grade 4
toxicities (Table 2). The most common grade 3 and 4
toxicities were fatigue (6 patients; 17%), anemia (3
patients; 8.6%), and leukopenia (3 patients; 8.6%).
Three patients (8.5%) went off study because of toxicity (fatigue). There were no deaths attributable to
aIFN. No delays in therapy occurred, although a
dose reduction was required as a consequence of
toxicity in 7 patients (20%). Patients received a median of 6 cycles (range, 2-20 cycles). All patients
went off study as a result of either aIFN-related toxicity (3 patients) or radiographically documented disease progression (32 patients).
All patients were evaluable for response (Fig. 1).
There were 26 patients with SD after the first 3
cycles of aIFN and 9 patients with progressive disease. Seven additional patients progressed after 6
months of aIFN, and 19 patients (54%) had SD. After 12 months of therapy, 8 more patients had progressed, and 11 patients (31%) still had SD. Five
patients had symptomatic neurologic improvement
on aIFN, all with a stable MRI pattern. No difference in response was observed when comparing
patients who had surgically reconfirmed grade 1

meningioma with patients who did not undergo
reoperation.
There were 35 patients with recurrent meningioma who were eligible for an intent-to-treat analysis.
All but 3 patients died of disease progression. The
median OS was 8 months (range, 3-28 months; 95%
confidence interval, 5.6-10.4 months). The overall
PFS rate was 54% at 6 months and 31% at 12
months. The median time to tumor progression was
7 months (range, 2-24 months; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-9.1 months).

DISCUSSION
The management of recurrent meningioma traditionally has emphasized reoperation, radiotherapy, or
stereotactic radiosurgery.1-6 However, there is a subset of patients with recurrent meningioma who want
further treatment but for whom both surgical and
radiotherapy options have been exhausted. In these
patients, chemotherapy or hormone therapy may be
considered.6-28 Despite several studies that suggesting that medical therapy may have some efficacy in
patients with recurrent meningiomas, many of those
studies were small, had very diverse eligibility criteria, and included patients who were not treated with
either surgery or radiotherapy, treatment modalities
with established efficacy that frequently produce
durable responses. Consequently, there is a paucity
of information on which to base treatment decisions.
In addition, none of the many cytotoxic, hormone, or
targeted therapies studied has produced consistent
or compelling evidence of efficacy.11-15,21-27
For the current study, we used aIFN in a subcutaneous dose schedule similar to that used to treat
renal cell cancer and melanoma. aIFN is a biologic
agent with modest toxicity and known activity in a
variety of cancers, including meningiomas and gliomas.32-35 It also has been documented that recombinant aIFN inhibits the growth of cultured human
meningioma cell lines.36 Four small reports, including 2 that were published as abstracts, were published previously that used aIFN for recurrent
meningioma.16-18,25 In the largest of those reports, 6
patients with recurrent, unresectable, and previously
irradiated meningiomas were treated.18 One patient
in that study had an objective response, and 4
patients had SD for >6 months.
In contrast to previous trials, the current study
was confined to patients who had histologically
documented WHO grade 1 meningiomas that had
recurred despite undergoing 1 or more prior surgeries (median, 2 prior surgeries). In addition all
patients had failed external beam radiotherapy, half

had received stereotactic radiotherapy, and nearly
all (34 of 35 patients) had progressed despite previous chemotherapy. aIFN was considered a reasonable alternative therapy for these patients with
recurrent, treatment-refractory meningiomas based
on the 4 small clinical studies described above; the
more extensive laboratory evidence suggesting antiproliferative, immunomodulatory, and antiangiogenic properties; and the lack of alternative therapies.16-18,32,33,37
Toxicity was moderate in this trial and consisted
mainly of fatigue, resulting in dose reductions in 7
patients (20%), institution of psychostimulant medication in 10 patients (28.5%), and early discontinuation of therapy in 3 patients (8.5%). On the basis of
the neuroradiographic data from this trial, aIFN
appears to function as a cytostatic antimeningioma
agent. There were no radiographic CRs or PRs. Nonetheless, meaningful palliation was achieved, as
reflected by a 6-month PFS rate of 54%, surpassing
the primary study objective of a 40% PFS rate at 6
months.
A caveat regarding the results of the current
study is recognition that very few immunochemotherapy studies have been conducted on refractory
meningiomas; therefore, there is a limited dataset
with which to compare this trial. In addition, malignant transformation to a higher grade meningioma
may have occurred, and the results may be reflective
of treating mixed grades of meningiomas. This issue
of unconfirmed pathology at the time of recurrence
also is common to all low and intermediate glioma
trials.

On the basis of the results of this study, aIFN
appears to have cytostatic activity against heavily
pretreated, recurrent meningiomas and could be
considered as a palliative therapy for patients who
have failed previous surgery and radiotherapy. Further phase 1/2 chemotherapy trials that include targeted therapies are warranted for this common
primary brain tumor.
