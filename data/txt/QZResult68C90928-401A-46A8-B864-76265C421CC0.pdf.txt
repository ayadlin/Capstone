Abstract
Platelets contribute to homeostasis of the tumor vasculature by helping prevent hemorrhage. Thus, we
hypothesized that inducing thrombocytopenia would increase tumor vascular leakiness and facilitate the effective
delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to tumors. In a mammary carcinoma murine model, platelet depletion
induced bleeding specifically at the tumor site, favoring the accumulation of fluorescently labeled microspheres
only in the tumor. Moreover, induction of thrombocytopenia in tumor-bearing mice before injection of paclitaxel
increased its intratumoral accumulation and reduced growth of both slow- and fast-growing tumors, compared
with mice with normal platelet counts that were treated only with paclitaxel. Histologic analysis confirmed the
expectation of an increase in tumor apoptosis and a reduction in tumor proliferation in thrombocytopenic mice
receiving chemotherapy. No increased toxicity was seen in other organs or blood cells. Taken together, our results
indicate that low platelet count selectively induces leakiness of tumor vessels and favors the delivery of
chemotherapy to tumor sites, enhancing its tumoricidal effects. Cancer Res; 71(5); 1540–9. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Cancer therapy is hampered by dose-limiting side effects
that reduce the efficacy of cancer treatments. Conventional
drugs used for treatment do not selectively accumulate in the
tumor (1). Thus, important research goals include delivering
high doses of drug to tumor sites for maximum treatment
efficacy while minimizing side effects to healthy tissues (2). In
the search for more effective treatments, efforts are made to
develop drugs that selectively target tumor antigens to preferentially deliver the therapeutic agent to the tumor site (1, 3).
Antigen heterogeneity among diverse types of tumors, and
among tumor cells of the same tumor, renders this approach
effective only in specific cases.
Other strategies target tumoral neovasculature. Angiogenesis is a hallmark feature of cancer growth, and tumor vessels
in distinct tumors may also express markers that are different
from normal vasculature (4). The targeting of angiogenesis is
therefore applicable to a wide range of different tumors.

and integrins have been described and used to alter tumor
vessels in animal and clinical studies (5–8). Unfortunately,
antiangiogenic therapies in cancer have until now shown only
limited or transient effects (9–11).
Platelets are a rich source of pro- and antiangiogenic factors
that are released in the circulation upon platelet activation
(12). Platelets also maintain the integrity of angiogenic and
inflamed microvessels (13, 14). Furthermore, we recently
showed that platelets support tumor vascular homeostasis
by preventing intratumoral hemorrhaging (15). The tumor
bleeding induced by thrombocytopenia cannot be prevented
by degranulated platelets, suggesting that the local release of
soluble factors protects the tumor endothelium against injuries produced by tumor-associated inflammatory cells (15, 16).
Because thrombocytopenia renders vessels in the tumor
leaky, we hypothesized that this leakiness would enhance the
access of chemotherapy to the tumor. Paclitaxel is a well-known
therapeutic drug used to treat breast cancer. It acts as a mitotic
inhibitor that stabilizes microtubules, interfering with their
normal breakdown during cell division, inducing apoptosis
(17–19). Here we show that thrombocytopenia promotes the
accumulation of inert particles at the tumor site, reflecting an
increase in porosity of the tumor vessels. Using mammary and
lung carcinoma mouse models, we show that thrombocytopenia
enhances the inhibitory effect of paclitaxel on tumor growth
without increasing its toxicity to other organs.

serum, 10 mmol/L HEPES buffer, 10 mmol/L sodium carbonate
(4T1 cells)]. The 4T1 cell line was originally isolated from a
spontaneously arising mammary tumor in a BALB/c mouse
(20) whereas LLC cells originated from C57BL/6 mice. The 4T1
and LLC cells were injected in syngeneic mice after less than 4
and 10 serial passages in vitro, respectively. For the fast-growing 4T1 model, the cells were cultivated for more than 25
passages. All cell lines were obtained from and characterized by
ATCC according to the cell line authentification testing
(growth curve analysis; mycoplasma, bacteria, and fungi contamination; DNA profiling; and species confirmation) and were
used within 6 months after resuscitation. All cell culture
products were purchased from Life Technologies/Invitrogen.
Animals
All animal procedures described in this study were carried
out using 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c female mice or C57BL/6
male mice (purchased from The Jackson Laboratory), except
in experiments using dorsal skinfold chamber for which 10week-old mice were used. All experimental procedures involving the use of mice were approved by the Animal Care and
Use Committee of the Immune Disease Institute.
Induction of thrombocytopenia
Thrombocytopenia was induced by an intravenous (i.v.)
injection of 2.5 mg/g of a platelet-depleting antibody (polyclonal rat IgG anti-mouse GPIba; emfret Analytics). Control
mice were injected with a nonimmune rat polyclonal IgG
(emfret Analytics). Thrombocytopenia was verified by flow
cytometry and resulted in less than 5% of normal platelet
count.
Determination of hemoglobin content
Organs and tumors of sacrificed animals were excised,
weighed, homogenized in Drabkin's reagent (Sigma), and
centrifuged (2,000  g; 10 minutes). Hemoglobin content of
supernatants was measured by absorbance at 540 nm.
Immunohistology
Tumors and organs were harvested from sacrificed animals
and fixed in zinc fixative (100 mmol/L Tris-HCl containing 37
mmol/L zinc chloride, 23 mmol/L zinc acetate, and 3.2 mmol/
L calcium acetate). Paraffin-embedded sections were deparaffinized in xylenes and rehydrated through a graded alcohol
series. For Perl's Prussian blue staining, the sections were
transferred to a mixture of equal parts of 2% potassium
ferrocyanide and 2% hydrochloric acid. Sections were counterstained with nuclear fast red. Tissues were dehydrated,
mounted in DPX mountant (Fluka BioChemika) and observed
by light microscopy. For quantification of apoptosis, the
sections were permeabilized and stained with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL; Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For quantification of proliferation,
the sections were stained with Ki-67-Alexa 555–conjugated
antibody (BD Biosciences). For quantification of apoptotic
endothelial cells, the sections were stained with TUNEL as
described earlier, incubated with a rat anti-CD31 antibody

www.aacrjournals.org

(eBioscience) and anti-rat Alexa-594 (Invitrogen) as secondary
antibody. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined as
the ratio of TUNEL-positive nuclei of CD31-positive cells to
the total CD31-positive cells. Pericytes were stained using a
rabbit anti-NG2 antibody (Chemicon) followed by incubation
with an anti-rabbit Alexa-488 (Invitrogen). Sections were
counterstained with Hoechst to visualize all nuclei, mounted
with Fluoro-gel (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and observed
under an epifluorescent microscope.
Imaging of fluorescently labeled microspheres
Dorsal skinfold chambers and surgical preparation were
performed as described (21). Two days after recovery, 1  106
4T1 or LLC cells were implanted in the conjunctive tissue
below the striated skin muscle layer and allowed to grow for 5
days. Thrombocytopenia was induced and mice were then
injected i.v. with 100  106 1-mm FluoSpheres, red fluorescent
carboxylate-modified microspheres (Invitrogen) 5 min later.
Tumors were photographed 24 hours after injection of the
platelet-depleting or control antibody. Microscopy imaging
was done using an upright microscope (Axioplan; Zeiss) with
2.5 or 4 magnification objectives and recorded by attached
digital camera (AxioCam HRc).
Induction of tumors and chemotherapeutic treatments
4T1 cells (4  105) were inoculated in the mammary fat-pad
of 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice. For the LLC model, 1.5  106
cells were inoculated subcutaneously in the right flank of 6- to
8-week-old C57BL/6 mice. Animals were monitored twice a
week, carefully measuring the tumors using calipers. The
tumor volume was calculated using the formula: V ¼ lw2 
0.4, where l is the length and w the width (22). For chemotherapeutic treatment, tumor-bearing mice were randomly distributed into 4 groups and injected i.v. with either the plateletdepleting or control antibody. Three hours later, mice were
injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with paclitaxel (30 mg/kg;
Sigma; Cremophor EL/Ethanol, 1:1 diluted in PBS) or vehicle.
For treatment characterization 72 hours posttreatment, blood
was collected and analyzed using the Hemavet blood cell
counter (Drew Scientific, Inc.). Tumor, spleen, liver, and
kidneys were examined and collected at necropsy.
Quantification of radiolabeled paclitaxel in the
mammary tumor
At day 10 after injection of 4T1 cells, the mice were
randomly distributed into 2 groups and injected i.v. with
either the platelet-depleting or control antibody. Three hours
later, mice were injected i.v. with 3H-paclitaxel (5 mCi/20 g
mouse; Moravek Biochemicals Inc.) and sacrificed after 2
hours. The tumors were collected, weighed, and solubilized
in Solvable (Perkin Elmer) overnight at 60 C, treated with
hydroxyperoxide 30% (Sigma), and analyzed for radioactivity
by liquid scintillation counting in a TRI-CARB liquid scintillation analyzer (Perkin Elmer).
LDH activity of tumor homogenate
For quantification of necrosis, the tumors were harvested and assessed for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

Results
Acute thrombocytopenia induces bleeding only at the
tumor site
We previously showed that thrombocytopenia induces
tumor hemorrhage without any macroscopic signs of bleeding in other organs (15). To address this more precisely, we
determined the hemoglobin content, reflecting the level of
red blood cell extravasation, of the major organs in thrombocytopenic versus control tumor-bearing mice. For this
purpose, 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells were implanted
in the mammary fat pad of BALB/c syngeneic mice and
allowed to grow. At day 8, platelet depletion was induced for
24 hours; subsequently, mice were sacrificed and the hemoglobin content of the organs and tumor was quantified. The
hemoglobin content in the tumors of mice with normal
platelet count was similar to that of the skin and less than
that of highly vascularized organs such as lung, liver, and
heart as expected (23). No significant difference in the
hemoglobin content of major organs was found between
thrombocytopenic mice and controls (Fig. 1A). In contrast, a
significant increase in hemoglobin content and the presence
of extravasated red blood cells (Fig. 1B) were observed in
mammary carcinomas of thrombocytopenic mice compared
with mice with normal platelet count. Furthermore, histopathologic analysis of paraffin-embedded tissues revealed
neither extravasated red blood cells (yellow/brown) nor
positive staining for ferric iron/hemosiderin (blue) in the
major organs except in the spleen of both control and
thrombocytopenic mice (Supplementary Fig. S1). These
results show that platelet depletion in tumor-bearing mice
induces red blood cell leakage specifically in the tumoral
vasculature, whereas intact vasculature is maintained in
other organs.
To determine the status of tumor vessels 24 hours after
induction of thrombocytopenia, we evaluated the percentage
of apoptotic endothelial cells in the tumors of thrombocytopenic mice compared with control mice. Immunostaining
analysis revealed a similar frequency of apoptotic endothelial
cells in the tumors (Fig. 1C). No obvious differences in the
mean diameter of the tumor vessels (Control 8.0  1.1 mm
versus Depleted 8.0  0.2 mm; P > 0.05, n ¼ 3) and in the
number of NG2-positive pericytes within the tumor sections
(Control 419.9  30.1 pericytes/mm2 versus Depleted 473.8 
22.4 pericytes/mm2; P > 0.05, n ¼ 4) were observed. These
results indicate that the overall structure of tumor vessels is

Thrombocytopenia induces tumor vascular porosity
that allows accumulation of fluorescently labeled
microspheres
Knowing that the absence of platelets induces tumor
hemorrhage, we hypothesized that thrombocytopenia results
in the formation of breaches in the tumor vasculature through
which circulating particles could pass. To investigate whether
tumor hemorrhage induces accumulation of circulating particles at the tumor site, we implanted 4T1 cells in dorsal
skinfold window chambers placed on the backs of BALB/c
mice. Induction of thrombocytopenia in such mice bearing a
5-day-old tumor in the skinfold results in tumor hemorrhage

(Fig. 2A). Five minutes after platelet depletion we injected
1-mm fluorescently labeled microspheres into the bloodstream. Intravital observation of the tumor through the dorsal
skinfold chamber revealed a massive deposition of fluorescent
microbeads at the site of hemorrhage 24 hours after platelet
depletion (Fig. 2 B and C). The microspheres concentrated
particularly in the vicinity of hemorrhaging blood vessels. This
accumulation of microspheres was seen in all 5 tumors of
thrombocytopenic mice whereas no accumulation was
observed in 4 tumors in mice with normal platelet count.
This result indicates that the selective induction of tumor
hemorrhage by platelet depletion facilitates the delivery and

Acute thrombocytopenia increases delivery of
paclitaxel to tumors
To evaluate whether the reduction in tumor growth
observed in combination treatments was the result of an
increase in the delivery of drug to the hemorrhagic tumors,
we quantified the presence of radiolabeled-paclitaxel in mammary tumors of thrombocytopenic mice compared with mice
with normal platelet count. Mice bearing 10-day-old tumors

in mice that received both treatments compared with control
mice. This reduction was significant only in the fast-growing
tumors, in which paclitaxel, affecting dividing cells, may have
had access to more targets. These results suggest that thrombocytopenia enhances the delivery of paclitaxel to the tumor
site and improves its tumoricidal effects.

revealed a significant increase of paclitaxel in the tumors of
thrombocytopenic mice compared with control tumors of
similar size. (Fig. 4A, B). Thrombocytopenia-induced tumor
bleeding results in the accumulation of approximately 40%
more radiolabeled drug in the thrombocytopenic tumors
compared with controls. This result shows that by inducing
tumor-bleeding acute thrombocytopenia allows the accumulation of circulating chemotherapeutic drug in tumors.

Thrombocytopenia does not increase the overall
toxicity of chemotherapeutic treatment
Chemotherapeutic treatments are known to display a wide
range of side effects (24). To determine whether the absence of
platelets also has an impact on the unspecific toxicity of
paclitaxel treatment, we evaluated apoptosis in the liver,
kidneys, and spleen in tumor-bearing mice 3 days after treatment. The results showed that whereas injection of either the
vehicle or paclitaxel increased apoptosis in the liver and
kidney (Fig. 5), no additional significant increase was observed
in mice treated with the platelet-depleting antibody. No signs
of apoptosis were seen in the spleen in any of the groups (not
shown).
Cell counter analysis of blood samples, collected 3 days after
the mice received combined treatments, revealed a persistent
significant reduction in platelet count but no significant
differences in the number of white blood cells and red blood
cells compared with the other groups (Fig. 6). Although not
significant, thrombocytopenic mice showed a tendency
toward reduced number of red blood cells. This reduction
could be explained by the tumor hemorrhage occurring in
these mice. Altogether, our results indicate that by depleting
platelets and rendering leaky only the vessels of the tumor, we
enhanced the access of chemotherapy to the tumor site
specifically and did not increase its general toxicity.
Thrombocytopenia allows accumulation of
microspheres and enhances the effect of paclitaxel on
LLC tumor growth
We previously showed that thrombocytopenia-induced
tumor hemorrhage was independent of the type, age, and
localization of the tumor (15). To examine whether increased
drug delivery to tumors in thrombocytopenic mice could be
generalized to other tumors, we studied LLC inoculated into
the flank of syngeneic mice. First, we evaluated whether
thrombocytopenia-induced tumor hemorrhage in this model
allows the accumulation of circulating particles at the tumor
site. Indeed, fluorescently labeled microspheres accumulated
preferentially in the hemorrhagic tumors compared with the
nonhemorrhagic tumors (Fig. 7A). Moreover, the combined

we compared the effect of the drug on tumor cell apoptosis
and proliferation 72 hours posttreatment. Immunofluorescent
analysis revealed a significant increase in the number of
apoptotic cells (Fig. 4C) and a significant reduction in the
number of proliferative cells (Fig. 4D) in the tumors of mice
that received both treatments. No significant change in
necrosis was seen in the thrombocytopenic tumors as
assessed by LDH activity of the tumor homogenate (vehicle
treated, 4,246  762 IU/L; paclitaxel treated, 3,761  132 IU/L)
compared with their respective normal platelet count controls
(vehicle treated 3,747  772 and paclitaxel treated 4,010  288
IU/L). These results indicate that the observed change in rate
of tumor growth in thrombocytopenic mice reflects the
expected effects of paclitaxel. Taken together, the results
indicate that thrombocytopenia, by increasing the leakiness
of tumor vessels, improves presentation of the drug to the
tumor, allowing it to further affect the tumor.

Figure 5. Thrombocytopenia in combination with paclitaxel does not
increase apoptosis in the liver and kidney. Seventy-two hours
posttreatment (as indicated), tumor-bearing mice were sacrificed and the
liver and kidney were harvested and stained for TUNEL. The apoptotic
index was calculated as the percentage of TUNEL-positive nuclei relative
to Hoechst-stained nuclei. Platelet depletion in combination with paclitaxel
treatment did not significantly affect apoptosis as compared with
paclitaxel treatment alone. Mean of 8 microscopic fields of each organ are
represented (n ¼ 4 mice per group; P > 0.05; NS).

treatment of platelet depletion and paclitaxel injection also
resulted in a significant reduction of LLC tumor growth
compared with treatment with paclitaxel alone. (Fig. 7B).
These results indicate that low platelet counts can be used
to increase the delivery and efficacy of a chemotherapeutic
agent to different types of tumors.

Discussion
Selective induction of tumor hemorrhage by targeting platelet function may facilitate the delivery of chemotherapeutic
agents to tumors. This hypothesis is supported by the following
observations: (a) thrombocytopenia induces tumor bleeding

Figure 7. Thrombocytopenia favors the accumulation of microspheres and
increases the efficacy of paclitaxel on LLC tumor growth. A, dorsal skinfold
chambers were surgically implanted on the backs of C57BL/6 mice. Two
days later, LLC tumor cells were injected within skinfold chamber and
allowed to grow. At day 5, mice were treated with either a control antibody
(Control) or a platelet-depleting antibody (Depleted) and 100106 1-mm
fluorescent microspheres. Photographs of a control and a
thrombocytopenic tumor were taken at 24 hours after platelet depletion.
Original magnification, 40; bar, 200 mm. Results are representative of 3
different hemorrhagic tumors and nonhemorrhagic tumors. B, LLC tumorbearing mice were treated on day 8 (arrow) as indicated and tumor growth
was monitored. Tumor growth is represented as the ratio of the tumor
volume at a specific day (V1) to the tumor volume before treatment (V0). At
day 11 and 14, a significant reduction in tumor growth was observed in
thrombocytopenic tumor-bearing mice receiving chemotherapy
compared with mice with normal platelet count treated with paclitaxel
alone (n ¼ 8–9 mice per group; *, P  0.05).

tumor growth and viability without increasing toxicity to other
organs. This study follows previous publications from our
group showing that platelets prevent bleeding of angiogenic
vessels (13) and continuously prevent intratumoral hemorrhage induced by tumor-infiltrating inflammatory cells by the
secretion of their granule contents (15, 16). Given that most
tumors are both angiogenic and proinflammatory (25, 26), we
now show that the thrombocytopenia-induced leakiness of
tumor vessels allows better access of a chemotherapeutic agent
to the tumor, thus increasing its efficacy.
An important goal in cancer therapy is to deliver high doses
of drug to tumor sites while minimizing side effects to healthy

organs. Conventional drugs used for cancer treatment are
administered systemically and distribute within the different
organs and tissues of the body. The dose that reaches the
tumor mass may be as little as 5% to 10% of that which
accumulates elsewhere (27). Therapies that target specific
tumor antigens are limited by their specificity and may not
be possible to develop for cancers that are not well defined.
Our model of thrombocytopenia induction favors the accumulation of particles and drug in bleeding tumors without
targeting a particular antigen. We also show that thrombocytopenia in combination with the chemotherapeutic treatment significantly reduced growth of 2 different tumor types.
The vascular damage caused by thrombocytopenia is because
of the tumor's inflammatory cells: neutrophils and monocytes
(16). Because inflammatory cells are present in most tumors
(28), inhibition of platelet function to improve drug delivery
should be widely applicable.
Mouse models of disease treatment are not always directly
applicable to human patients. In fact, the use of thrombocytopenia to improve chemotherapeutic treatment could raise
concerns for the well-being of patients. However, we showed
here that no signs of systemic hemorrhage were associated with
thrombocytopenia. Moreover, low platelet counts needed to be
achieved only transiently to be effective in our model. We
previously showed that commencement of tumor hemorrhage
can be seen as early as 30 minutes after the induction of
thrombocytopenia (15). Perhaps thrombocytopenia would only
need to occur long enough to induce tumor hemorrhage and
allow drug accumulation. It must also be noted that chemotherapeutic agents are characterized by a short half-life. Maintaining thrombocytopenia in patients for more than a few hours
would therefore not increase the effect of the drug. Once the
drug is no longer in circulation, normal platelet counts should
be restored. In addition, chemotherapies are themselves known
to induce thrombocytopenia in patients (29, 30). Treatment
schedules could be adjusted to take advantage of the already
occurring thrombocytopenia-induced injuries of tumor vessels
to enhance drug delivery by delaying platelet transfusion.
Platelets are key players in tumor vascular homeostasis.
More than 300 proteins and small molecules have been shown
to be secreted from activated platelets (31). It is known that

bleeding cannot be prevented by degranulated platelets, suggesting that platelet granule contents are important to arrest
bleeding in the tumor by the local release of soluble factors
that heal or prevent inflammatory injuries (15, 16). Platelet
granules are known to contain both pro- and antiangiogenic
factors, cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and many
other molecules that could potentially influence vessel injuries. Since the 1990s, platelet releasate has been used to heal
wounds, and autologous platelet-rich plasma has been shown
to protect against capillary bleeding (32). To our knowledge,
the factor(s) responsible for this particular function of platelets are still unknown and are currently under investigation in
our laboratory. Identification of these factor(s) responsible for
the prevention of bleeding would open a new area of drug
development. Potentially, physicians may target platelets’
ability to prevent tumoral hemorrhage specifically without
inducing thrombocytopenia. Such antiplatelet treatment combined with chemotherapy to enhance drug delivery to the
tumor would represent a significant improvement in our
ability to fight cancer with minimal side effects.
