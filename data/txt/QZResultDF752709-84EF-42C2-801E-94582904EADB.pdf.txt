Abstract
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) often develops in association with liver cirrhosis, and its high recurrence rate
leads to poor patient prognosis. Although recent evidence suggests that peretinoin, a member of the acyclic
retinoid family, may be an effective chemopreventive drug for HCC, published data about its effects on hepatic
mesenchymal cells, such as stellate cells and endothelial cells, remain limited. Using a mouse model in which
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-C is overexpressed (Pdgf-c Tg), resulting in hepatic ﬁbrosis, steatosis, and
eventually, HCC development, we show that peretinoin signiﬁcantly represses the development of hepatic ﬁbrosis
and tumors. Peretinoin inhibited the signaling pathways of ﬁbrogenesis, angiogenesis, and Wnt/b-catenin in Pdgfc transgenic mice. In vitro, peretinoin repressed the expression of PDGF receptors a/b in primary mouse hepatic
stellate cells (HSC), hepatoma cells, ﬁbroblasts, and endothelial cells. Peretinoin also inhibited PDGF-C–activated
transformation of HSCs into myoﬁbroblasts. Together, our ﬁndings show that PDGF signaling is a target of
peretinoin in preventing the development of hepatic ﬁbrosis and HCC. Cancer Res; 72(17); 4459–71. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common
malignancies worldwide with a particularly poor patient outcome (1). It often develops as a result of chronic liver disease
associated with hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection or
with other etiologies such as long-term alcohol abuse, autoimmunity, and hemochromatosis (2–5). Despite the recent
advances in antiviral therapy for hepatitis B or hepatitis C
virus, these are insufﬁcient to completely prevent the occurrence of HCC. Moreover, the recent increase in nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with metabolic syndrome is a potential high-risk factor for the development of
HCC (6).
HCC often develops during the advanced stages of liver
ﬁbrosis and is associated with deposits of extracellular

matrix synthesized by activated stellate cells. During the
course of chronic hepatitis, nonparenchymal cells, including
Kupffer, endothelial, and activated stellate cells, release a
variety of cytokines and growth factors. One of these growth
factors is platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which is
involved in ﬁbrogenesis, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis
(7, 8). PDGF expression has been shown to be upregulated
from the early stages of chronic hepatitis, suggesting its
association with the development of ﬁbrosis in chronic
hepatitis C (CH-C; refs. 9 and 10). Overexpression of
PDGF-C in mouse liver resulted in the progression of
hepatic ﬁbrosis, steatosis, and the development of HCC;
this mouse model closely resembles the human HCC, which
is frequently associated with hepatic ﬁbrosis (7).
Peretinoin (generic name; code, NIK-333), developed by the
Kowa Company, is an oral acyclic retinoid with a vitamin A–
like structure, which targets the retinoid nuclear receptor. Oral
administration of peretinoin was shown to signiﬁcantly reduce
the incidence of posttherapeutic HCC recurrence and improve
the survival rates of patients in a clinical trial (11, 12). A largescale clinical study including various countries is now planned
to conﬁrm its clinical efﬁcacy.
Although peretinoin treatment can suppress HCC-derived
cell line growth and inhibit experimental mouse or rat liver
carcinogenesis (13, 14), the detailed mechanism of its effect has
not been fully elucidated. Peretinoin has a high binding afﬁnity
to cellular retinoic acid-binding protein (15) and may interact
with retinoic acid receptor-b and retinoid X receptor-a (16);
however, the precise molecular targets for preventing HCC
recurrence have not yet been elucidated.

In this study, we used PDGF-C transgenic (Pdgf-c Tg) mice to
show that PDGF-C signaling is a possible target of peretinoin in
the prevention of hepatic ﬁbrosis, angiogenesis, and the development of HCC.

Materials and Methods
Chemicals
The acyclic retinoid peretinoin (generic name; code, NIK333) [(2E,4E,6E,10E)-3,7,11,15-tetramethyl-2,4,6,10,14-hexadecapentaenoic acid, C20H30O2, molecular weight 302.46 g/mol]
was supplied by Kowa Company.
Animal studies
The generation and characterization of Pdgf-c Tg have been
described previously (7). Wild-type and Pdgf-c Tg mice on a
C57BL/6J background were maintained in a pathogen-free
animal facility under a standard 12-hour/12-hour light/dark
cycle. After weaning at week 4, male mice were randomly
divided into the following 3 groups: (1) Pdgf-c Tg or wild-type
(WT) mice given a basal diet (CRF-1, Charles River Laboratories Japan), (2) Pdgf-c Tg or WT mice given a 0.03% peretinoincontaining diet, (3) Pdgf-c Tg or WT mice given a 0.06%
peretinoin-containing diet. Control mice were normal male
homozygotes. At week 20, mice were sacriﬁced to analyze the
progression of hepatic ﬁbrosis (n ¼ 15 for each of the 3 groups).
At week 48, mice were sacriﬁced to analyze the development of
hepatic tumors (n ¼ 31 for the basal diet group, n ¼ 37 for the
0.03% peretinoin group, and n ¼ 17 for the 0.06% peretinoin
group). The incidence of hepatic tumors, maximum tumor size,
and liver weight were evaluated. None of the treated WT mice
given a diet of 0.03% peretinoin died, but death occurred in 5%
of WT mice around after 36 weeks of age receiving a 0.06%
peretinoin diet, probably because of its toxicity. In Pdgf-c Tg
mice, death was observed at similar frequency as WT mice that
received 0.06% peretinoin diet.
All animal experiments were carried out in accordance with
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals at the
Takara-Machi Campus of Kanazawa University, Japan.
Cell culture
Human HCC cell lines Huh-7, HepG2, and HLE, the mouse
ﬁbroblast cell line NIH3T3, human umbilical vein endothelial
cells (HUVEC), and human stellate cells Lx-2 (kindly provided
by Dr. Scott Friedman, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New
York, NY) were maintained in Dulbecco's Modiﬁed Eagle
Medium (DMEM; Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco),
1% L-glutamine (Gibco), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Gibco) in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 C. 1 to
5  104 cells were seeded in each well of a 12-well plate the day
before serum starvation in serum-free DMEM for 8 hours. The
culture medium was then replaced with serum-free medium
containing peretinoin. After 24-hour incubation, cells were
harvested for analysis.
Isolation and culture of mouse hepatic stellate cells
Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were isolated from C57BL/6J
mice and the effect of recombinant human PDGF-C and

4460

peretinoin on HSCs was evaluated in vitro. Pronase-collagenase
liver digestion was used to isolate HSC from wild-type mice. All
experiments were replicated at least twice. Freshly isolated
HSCs suspended in culture medium were seeded in uncoated
24-well plates and incubated at 37 C in a humidiﬁed atmosphere of 5% CO2 for 72 hours. Nonadherent cells were
removed with a pipette and the culture medium was replaced
with medium containing 80 ng/mL recombinant human
PDGF-C (Abnova) with or without peretinoin or 9-cis-retinoic
acid (9cRA; 5 or 10 mmol/L). Cells were harvested for analysis
after 24-hour incubation.
Isolation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were harvested and
labeled with FITC-conjugate CD34 (Cell Lab) and R-Phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated CD31 antibodies (Cell Lab) for 30
minutes at 4 C. After washing with 1 mL PBS, CD31 and CD34
surface expression was measured with a FACSCalibur ﬂow
cytometer (BD Biosciences). All ﬂow cytometric data were
analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star).
Gene expression proﬁling
Gene expression proﬁling in mouse liver was evaluated
using the GeneChip Mouse Genome 430 2.0 Array (Affymetrix). Liver tissue from WT, Pdgf-c Tg, and Pdgf-c Tg with
0.06% peretinoin mice all at weeks 20 and 48 was obtained
and a total of 34 chip assays were conducted as described
previously (17). Expression data have been deposited in
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; NCBI Accession;
GSE31431).
Pathway analysis was conducted using MetaCore (GeneGo).
Functional ontology enrichment analysis was conducted to
compare the Gene Ontology (GO) process distribution of
differentially expressed genes (P < 0.01; refs. 10 and 17). Direct
interactions among differentially expressed genes between
Pdgf-c Tg mice with or without peretinoin administration were
examined as reported previously (10). Each connection represents a direct, experimentally conﬁrmed, physical interaction
(MetaCore).
Histopathology and immunohistochemical staining
Mouse liver tissues were ﬁxed in 10% formalin and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin. The liver neoplasms (HCC and
liver cell adenoma) were diagnosed according to previously
described criteria (18, 19). Hepatic ﬁbrosis was evaluated by
Azan staining. Percentages of ﬁbrous areas were calculated
microscopically using an image analysis system (BIOREVO BZ9000: KEYENCE Japan). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining
was conducted by an immunoperoxidase technique with an
Envision kit (DAKO). Primary antibodies used were: rabbit
polyclonal PDGFR-a (1:100 dilution), PDGFR-b (1:100 dilution), VEGFR1 (1:100 dilution), desmin (1:100 dilution), b-catenin (1:200 dilution), and mouse monoclonal cyclin D1 (1:400

CD34 (1:100 dilution; all from Abcam, Cambridge, MA); and
Tie-2 (1:80 dilution) and Myc (1:100 dilution; both from Santa
Cruz Biotechnology).

Quantitative real-time detection PCR
Total RNA was isolated from frozen liver tissue samples
using a GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
cDNA was synthesized from 100 ng total RNA using a highcapacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) then mixed with the TaqMan Universal Master
Mix (Applied Biosystems) and each TaqMan probe. TaqMan probes used were PDGFR-a/b, VEGFR1/2, a-SMA,

and lysed by CelLytic MT cell lysis reagent (Sigma-Aldrich)
containing Complete Mini EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Cytoplasmic and nuclear protein extracts
were prepared using the NE-PER nuclear extraction reagent kit
(Pierce Biotechnology). Primary antibodies used were PDGFRa (1:1,000 dilution), PDGFR-b (1:1,000 dilution), VEGFR2

Results
Peretinoin prevented the development of hepatic
ﬁbrosis in Pdgf-c Tg
To evaluate the HCC chemopreventive effects of peretinoin, we used a mouse model of Pdgf-c Tg in which PDGF-C
is expressed under the control of the albumin promoter (7).
Experimental mice were male mice expressing the PDGF-C
transgene (Pdgf-c Tg); whereas male mice not expressing
the transgene were considered WT. After weaning at week 4,
Pdgf-c Tg or nontransgenic WT mice were fed a basal diet
or a diet containing 0.03% or 0.06% peretinoin. At week 20,
mice were sacriﬁced to analyze the progression of hepatic
ﬁbrosis. At week 48, mice were sacriﬁced to analyze the
development of hepatic tumors (Fig. 1A). At week 20, Azan
staining showed that predominant pericellular ﬁbrosis had
developed in Pdgf-c Tg mice (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis
showed a signiﬁcant dose-dependent reduction in the size
of the ﬁbrotic area in mice that received a diet containing
peretinoin at both weeks 20 and 48 (Fig. 1C). Peretinoin

therefore efﬁciently repressed the development of hepatic
ﬁbrosis in Pdgf-c Tg mice.
The expression of ﬁbrosis-related genes in Pdgf-c Tg
mice was evaluated by IHC staining, quantitative real-time
detection PCR (RTD-PCR), and Western blotting. The expression of PDGFR-a and PDGFR-b, essential receptors for
intracellular PDGF-C signaling, was upregulated mainly in
the intracellular or portal area in Pdgf-c Tg mice livers
(Fig. 2), but was signiﬁcantly repressed by peretinoin after
weaning at week 4. Similarly, the expression of collagen 1,
collagen 4, and desmin was signiﬁcantly upregulated in Pdgfc Tg mice, but repressed by peretinoin (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1A).
RTD-PCR results conﬁrmed that these genes were substantially upregulated in Pdgf-c Tg mice and signiﬁcantly
repressed by both 0.03% and 0.06% peretinoin (Fig. 3A).
Western blotting showed that the expression of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) 1/2 and
cyclin D1, representative markers of the cell proliferation
signaling pathway, was upregulated in Pdgf-c Tg mice, and
repressed by peretinoin (Fig. 3B). Thus, peretinoin could
partially but signiﬁcantly prevent the development of hepatic ﬁbrosis in Pdgf-c Tg mice during the study observation
period of 48 weeks.
Peretinoin prevented the development of HCC
in Pdgf-c Tg mice
At week 48, Pdgf-c Tg mice developed hepatic tumors with an
incidence of 90% (Fig. 4A). Histologic assessment of these
tumors veriﬁed that 54% (15/28) were adenomas and 46%
(13/28) were HCC (Fig. 4A and C and Supplementary Fig. S2;
ref. 21). Peretinoin (0.03%) dose-dependently repressed the
incidence of hepatic tumors to 53% (19/36) and to 29% (5/17) at
0.06%. Correlating with tumor incidence, maximum tumor size
and liver weight were also signiﬁcantly repressed by peretinoin
(Fig. 4B). Thus, peretinoin repressed the development of
hepatic tumors in Pdgf-c Tg mice.
Serial gene expression proﬁling in the liver of Pdgf-c Tg
mice that developed hepatic ﬁbrosis and tumors
To examine which signaling pathways were altered during
the progression of hepatic ﬁbrosis and tumor development, we
analyzed gene expression proﬁling in the liver of Pdgf-c Tg mice
using Affymetrix gene chips. By ﬁltering criteria for P < 0.001
and more than 2-fold differences, 538 genes were selected as
differentially expressed. One-way hierarchical clustering analysis of differentially expressed genes is shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.
Of the 3 main clusters, 2 were upregulated (clusters A and B)
and 1 was downregulated (cluster C). Cluster A consisted of
immune-related [chemokine (C-C motif) receptor (CCR)4,
CCR2, toll-like receptor (TLR)3 and TLR4], apoptosis-related
[caspase (CASP)1 and CASP9], angiogenesis- and/or growth
factor–related (PDGF-C, VEGF-C, osteopontin, HGF), oncogene-related [v-ets erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (Ets)1, Ets2, CD44, N-myc downstream-regulated
(NDRG)1], and ﬁbrosis-related (tubulin) genes. The expression
of cluster A genes was further upregulated in tumors at week

48. Cluster B consisted mainly of connective tissue- and/or
ﬁbrosis-related [vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)1,
collagen I, III, IV, V, VI, integrin, decorin, TGF-bRII, PDGFRa, and PDGFR-b] genes, the expression of which declined
slightly at week 48. In contrast, cluster C, containing differentiation and liver function related genes [cytochrome P450,
family 2, subfamily c (CYP2C)], were downregulated during
the course of hepatic ﬁbrosis and tumor development (Sup-

plementary Fig. S4). Cluster C included xenobiotic- and metabolic process–related genes, which are potential targets of
peretinoin. Peretinoin treatment prevented hepatic ﬁbrosis
and it preserved liver function. In addition, peretinoin might
induce its target genes. Thus, peretinoin reduced the expression of upregulated genes (clusters A and B) and restored the
expression of downregulated genes (cluster C) at both weeks 20
and 48 (Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4).

To examine the molecular network consisting of differentially expressed genes in Pdgf-c Tg mice with or without
peretinoin administration, the direct interactions of 513 genes
were analyzed by MetaCore (i.e., 413 genes were downregulated and 100 genes were upregulated in Pdgf-c Tg mice treated
with peretinoin compared with untreated mice; P < 0.002). A
core gene network consisting of 41 genes was obtained (Supplementary Fig. S5) including interactions between representative growth factors, receptors (PDGFR and TGFbR), and
transcriptional factors. Of these genes, the transcriptional
factors Sp1 and Ap1 seem to be key regulators in the network
(Supplementary Fig. S5).
Peretinoin inhibits PDGFR in vitro
Gene expression proﬁling landscaped the dynamic changes
of signaling pathways in Pdgf-c Tg mice. To determine the
effects of peretinoin in vitro, primary HSCs from normal
C57BL/6J mice were stimulated by PDGF-C (Fig. 5) to induce
the expression of PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, alpha smooth muscle
actin (a-SMA), and collagen 1a2; activated HSCs thus transformed into myoﬁbroblasts (Fig. 5A and B). Peretinoin significantly reduced the expression of these genes and inhibited
HSC activation.
We next evaluated the effects of peretinoin on human
hepatoma cell lines (Huh-7, HepG2, and HLE), mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast cells (NIH3T3), HUVECs, and Lx-2 (ref. 22;
Supplementary Fig. S6A). Experimental conditions were
optimized so that more than 90% of cells were variable at
20 mmol/L peretinoin, as determined by an MTS cell prolifer-

ation assay (data not shown). Peretinoin dose-dependently
inhibited the expression of PDGFR-a and PDGFR-b in Huh-7,
HepG2, HLE, NIH3T3, HUVEC, and Lx-2 cells, whereas no
obvious expression of PDGFR-a was observed in HepG2 cells
and HUVECs (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Peretinoin also inhibited VEGFR2 expression in HUVEC. These results were conﬁrmed by RTD-PCR (data not shown). Correlating with these
results, the expression of phosphorylated serine/threonine
kinase AKT (p-AKT) and p-ERK1/2, downstream signaling
molecules of PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, and VEGFR2, was also
dose-dependently repressed. The expression of collagen 1a2
was signiﬁcantly repressed by peretinoin in Lx-2, HLE, and
Huh-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B). These results suggest
that peretinoin may inhibit hepatic ﬁbrosis, angiogenesis, and
tumor growth through reduction of the PDGF and VEGF
signaling pathway.
We examined the expression of 2 key regulators in
peretinoin signaling, Sp1 and Ap1, in Huh-7 cells. Interestingly, the expression of Sp1 was decreased, which
correlates with that of PDGFR-a, whereas expression of
phosphorylated c-Jun (p-c-Jun) was increased in Huh-7
cells (Supplementary Fig. S6C). Therefore, peretinoin seems
to repress the expression of PDGFR, partially through the
inhibition of Sp1.

endothelial markers CD31 and CD34 and the endothelial

and Supplementary Fig. S1A). This expression was signiﬁcantly
repressed by peretinoin as determined by the densitometric
area (Supplemental Fig. S1B). RTD-PCR results revealed signiﬁcant upregulation of VEGFR1 (Flt-1) in Pdgf-c Tg mice
compared with WT mice at both weeks 20 and 48, whereas
the expression of VEGFR2 (Flk-1) and Tie2 was only upregulated at week 48. The expression of these genes was signiﬁ-

conﬁrmed the upregulation of CD31 and VEGFR1 (Flk-1) at
week 48 (Fig. 6B). In addition, p-AKT (Thr 308 and Ser 473) and
4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), an oxidative stress marker,
were upregulated in Pdgf-c Tg mice and repressed by peretinoin
(Fig. 6B).
We also assessed circulating endothelial cells (CEC), a
useful biomarker for angiogenesis in the blood, and found
that the CD31þ/CD34þ CEC population was signiﬁcantly
upregulated in Pdgf-c Tg mice at week 48 but signiﬁcantly
repressed by peretinoin (Fig. 6C and D). Thus, peretinoin

seems to inhibit angiogenesis in the liver of Pdgf-c Tg
mice, which might prevent the development of hepatic
tumors.
Peretinoin inhibits canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling
in Pdgf-c Tg mice
The activation of the Wnt/b-catenin signaling pathway is
seen in 17% to 40% of patients with primary HCC (23, 24).
Moreover, recent reports suggested an interaction between
PDGF signaling and Wnt/b-catenin signaling (25–27).
We evaluated Wnt/b-catenin signaling in Pdgf-c Tg mice

and showed by IHC staining that b-catenin was overexpressed in the submembrane at week 48 (Fig. 7A). Peretinoin
signiﬁcantly reduced this expression (Fig. 7A and B), and
Western blotting revealed that accumulation of b-catenin
in the nuclear fraction of liver tumor tissues was more
preferentially repressed by peretinoin than in the cytoplasmic fraction, although expression was repressed in both
fractions (Fig. 7C). Wnt ligand (Wnt5a) and frizzled receptor
(Fzd1) expression was signiﬁcantly upregulated in hepatic
tumors compared with normal liver (Fig. 7D). These
results together suggest that canonical Wnt/b-catenin

Growth factors such as PDGF or HGF potentially activate

Fit-1, and Flk-1 were signiﬁcantly upregulated from 1.5- to
4-fold in hepatic tumors compared with normal liver, and
this expression was signiﬁcantly repressed by peretinoin.
Similarly, the expression of PDGFR-a, PDGFR-b, collagen
1a2, collagen 4a2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2
(TIMP2), and cyclin D1 was substantially upregulated from
5- to 15-fold in hepatic tumors, and signiﬁcantly repressed
by peretinoin (Fig. 7D). Thus, growth factor signaling as well
as canonical Wnt/b-catenin signaling in hepatic tumors
seems to be repressed by peretinoin. These results explain

the inhibitory effect of peretinoin in the development of HCC
in Pdgf-c Tg mice.

Discussion
HCC often develops in association with liver cirrhosis and its
high recurrence rate leads to poor patient prognosis. Indeed,
the 10-year recurrence-free survival rate after liver resection for
HCC with curative intent was shown to be only 20% (29).
Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop effective preventive therapy for HCC recurrence to improve its prognosis.
Peretinoin, a member of the acyclic retinoid family, is
expected to be an effective chemopreventive drug for HCC
(11, 12, 30) as shown by a previous phase II/III trial in which
600 mg peretinoin per day in the Child-Pugh A subgroup
reduced the risk of HCC recurrence or death by 40% [HR ¼
0.60 (95% CI, 0.40–0.89); ref. 31]. However, further clinical

studies are needed to conﬁrm the clinical efﬁcacy of peretinoin, and a large scale study involving several countries is
currently being planned.
During the course of chronic hepatitis, nonparenchymal
cells including Kupffer, endothelial and activated stellate cells
release a variety of cytokines and growth factors that might
accelerate hepatocarcinogenesis. Although peretinoin has

been shown to suppress the growth of HCC-derived cells by
inducing apoptosis and differentiation (32–35), increasing p21
and reducing cyclin D1 (13), limited data have been published
about its effects on hepatic mesenchymal cells such as stellate
cells and endothelial cells (14).
In parallel with a phase II/III trial, we conducted a
pharmacokinetics study of peretinoin focusing on 12

patients with CH-C and HCC to monitor the biological
behavior of peretinoin in the liver. Gene expression proﬁling
during peretinoin administration revealed that HCC recurrence within 2 years could be predicted and that PDGF-C
expression was one of the strongest predictors. In addition,
other genes related to angiogenesis, cancer stem cell and
tumor progression were downregulated, whereas expression
of genes related to hepatocyte differentiation and tumor
suppression was upregulated by peretinoin (data not
shown). Moreover, a recent report revealed the emerging
signiﬁcance of PDGF-C–mediated angiogenic and tumorigenic properties (7, 8, 36). In this study, we therefore used
the mouse model of Pdgf-c Tg, which displays the phenotypes of hepatic ﬁbrosis, steatosis, and HCC development

4468

that resemble human HCC arising from chronic hepatitis
usually associated with advanced hepatic ﬁbrosis.
We showed that peretinoin effectively inhibits the progression of hepatic ﬁbrosis and tumors in Pdgf-c Tg mice (Figs. 1
and 4). Affymetrix gene chips analysis revealed dynamic
changes in hepatic gene expression (Supplementary Fig. S3),
which were conﬁrmed by IHC staining, RTD-PCR and Western
blotting. Pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes
suggested that the transcriptional regulators Sp1 and Ap1 are
key regulators in the peretinoin inhibition of hepatic ﬁbrosis
and tumor development in Pdgf-c Tg mice (Supplementary
Fig. S5).
We clearly showed that peretinoin inhibited PDGF signaling through the inhibition of PDGFRs (Figs. 2 and 3). In

addition, we showed that PDGFR repression by peretinoin
inhibited primary stellate cell activation (Fig. 5). Interestingly,
this inhibitory effect was more pronounced than the effects
of 9cRA (Fig. 5B). Normal mouse and human hepatocytes
neither express PDGF receptors (J.S. Campbell and N. Fausto,
unpublished data), nor proliferate in response to treatment
with PDGF ligands (7). However, peretinoin inhibited the
expression of PDGFRs, collagens, and their downstream
signaling molecules in cell lines of hepatoma (Huh-7, HepG2,
and HLE), ﬁbroblast (NIH3T3), endothelial cells (HUVEC),
and stellate cells (Lx-2; Supplementary Fig. S6). Furthermore,
Sp1 but not Ap1, might be involved in the repression of
PDGFR-a in Huh-7 cells (Supplementary Fig. 6C). The overexpression of Sp1-activated PDGFR-a promoter activity,
whereas siRNA knockdown of Sp1 repressed PDGFR-a promoter activity in Huh-7 cells (data not shown). Therefore,
this seems to conﬁrm that Sp1 is involved in the regulation of
PDGFR, as reported previously (37, 38), although these ﬁndings should be further investigated in different cell lines. A
recent report showed the involvement of transglutaminase
2, caspase3, and Sp1 in peretinoin signaling (35).
Peretinoin was shown to inhibit angiogenesis in the liver of
Pdgf-c Tg mice in this study, as shown by the decreased
expression of VEGFR1/2 and Tie 2 (Figs. 2 and 6 and Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, peretinoin inhibited the number of
CD31þ and CD34þ endothelial cells (CEC) in the blood and
liver (Fig. 6C and D), while also inhibiting the expression of
EGFR, c-kit, PDGFRs, and VEGFR1/2 in Pdgf-c Tg mice (data
not shown). We also showed that peretinoin inhibited the
expression of multiple growth factors such as HGF, IGF,
VEGF, PDGF, and HDGF, which were upregulated from 3- to
10-fold in Pdgf-c Tg mice (Supplementary Fig. S3). These
activities collectively might contribute to the antitumor
effect of peretinoin in Pdgf-c Tg mice. The inhibition of both
PDGFRs and VEGFR signaling by peretinoin was previously
shown to have a signiﬁcant effect on tumor growth (36), and
we conﬁrmed herein that peretinoin inhibited the expression of VEGFR2 in HUVECs (Supplementary Fig. S6; ref. 39).
Finally, we showed that peretinoin inhibited canonical Wnt/
b-catenin signaling by showing the decreased nuclear accumulation of b-catenin (Fig. 7). These data conﬁrm the
previous hypothesis of transrepression of the b-catenin
promoter by 9cRA in vitro (40).
Although we showed that the PDGF signaling pathway is a
target of peretinoin for preventing the development of hepatic
ﬁbrosis and tumors in mice, retinoid-inducing genes such as
G0S2 (41), TGM2 (35), CEBPA (42), ATF, TP53BP, metallothionein 1H (MT1H), MT2A, and hemopexin (HPX) were upregulated in peretinoin-treated mice (data not shown). These
canonical retinoid pathways are likely to participate in preventing disease progression in conjunction with anti-PDGF
effects.

The precise mechanism of peretinoin toxicity, in which 5% of
mice treated with 0.06% peretinoin died after 24 weeks of
treatment, is currently under investigation. These mice showed
severe osteopenia and we speculate that the toxicity might be
caused by retinoid-induced osteopenia, as observed in a
hypervitaminosis A rat model (43). However, the toxicity of
prolonged treatment with oral retinoids in humans remains
controversial (44) and severe osteopenia has so far only been
seen in a rodent model.
In summary, we show that peretinoin effectively inhibits
hepatic ﬁbrosis and HCC development in Pdgf-c Tg mice.
Further studies are needed to elucidate the detailed molecular
mechanisms of peretinoin action and the effect of peretinoin
on PDGF-C in human HCC. The recently developed multikinase inhibitor Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006, Nexavar) was shown
to improve the prognosis of patients with advanced HCC (45).
Promisingly, a phase II/III trial of peretinoin showed it to be
safe and well tolerated (46). Therefore, combinatorial therapy
that incorporates the use of small molecule inhibitors with
peretinoin may be beneﬁcial to some patients. The application
of peretinoin during pre- or early-ﬁbrosis stage could be
beneﬁcial in preventing the progression of ﬁbrosis and subsequent development of HCC in patients with chronic liver
disease.
