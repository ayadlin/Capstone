BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to evaluate whether baseline acute and chronic prostate inflammation among men
with an initial negative biopsy for prostate cancer (PCa) increased the risk of subsequent PCa detection in a clinical trial with systematic biopsies. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed of 6238 men aged 50 years to 75 years with prostate-specific antigen levels between 2.5 ng=mL and 10 ng=mL and a prior negative biopsy in the REduction by DUtasteride of PCa Events study who
completed a 2-year biopsy. PCa, acute prostate inflammation, and chronic prostate inflammation were assessed by central review.
The association between inflammation in baseline prostate biopsies and positive 2-year and 4-year repeat biopsies was evaluated
with the chi-square test and logistic regression analysis adjusting for baseline covariates. RESULTS: Acute and chronic inflammation
and both were detected in 46 baseline biopsies (1%), 3931 baseline biopsies (63%), and 892 baseline biopsies (14%), respectively.
Acute and chronic inflammation were found to be significantly associated with each other (P <.001). Acute inflammation at baseline
biopsy was associated with younger age, lower prostate-specific antigen levels, and a smaller prostate (all P <.01), whereas chronic
inflammation was associated with older age and larger prostate glands (all P < 0.01). At the 2-year biopsy, the prevalence of PCa was
14% (N 5 900 patients). On univariable and multivariable analysis, both acute and chronic inflammation were found to be significantly
associated with a lower PCa risk (acute univariable: odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [P <.001] and multivariable: OR, 0.75 [P 5.012] and chronic
univariable: OR, 0.61 [P <.001] and multivariable: OR, 0.65 [P <.001]). At the time of 4-year biopsy, only acute inflammation was found
to be associated with a lower PCa risk. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline acute and chronic inflammation were both found to be independently associated with a lower PCa risk. From a clinical standpoint, inflammation in negative biopsies for PCa may lower the risk of

INTRODUCTION
Inflammation is known to be associated with several cancers and in some cases it is directly linked to carcinogenesis. Since
1863, when Rudolf Virchow noted leukocytes in neoplastic tissues and made a connection between inflammation and
cancer, several inflammation-related tumors have been described.1 For example, inflammatory bowel disease has been correlated with colorectal carcinogenesis. In addition, certain infections accompanied by a chronic inflammatory reaction
such as viral hepatitis and schistosomiasis are associated with an increased risk of liver and bladder cancers, respectively.1
However, the association between inflammation and prostate cancer (PCa) is controversial. There is evidence suggesting
that antiinflammatory agents such as aspirin may reduce the incidence of PCa.2,3 In addition, multiple studies have shown
an association between clinical prostatitis and risk of PCa.4-7 For example, a meta-analysis of 11 studies published through
2000 revealed a 60% increased risk of PCa in men with a history of prostatitis.6 Furthermore, a questionnaire-based study
of 68,675 men demonstrated an increased incidence of PCa in subjects with a self-reported history of prostatitis and=or

sexually transmitted diseases.7 However, other studies
failed to demonstrate such an association, which suggests
the possibility of recall and=or detection bias given that
men with urinary symptoms are more likely to be screened
for PCa.8,9
Notably, histological inflammation is frequently
present in prostate biopsies, radical prostatectomy specimens, and tissue resected for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.10 However, to the best of our
knowledge, the clinical significance of asymptomatic
prostatic inflammation in negative biopsies for PCa is not
completely known. Some small studies have suggested
that histological prostate inflammation is associated with
a lower risk of cancer after repeat prostate biopsies.11,12
However, because prostate inflammation can elevate
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels13 and men are typically selected for repeat prostate biopsy based on their
PSA level, it is possible that men with inflammation are
selected for repeat biopsy more often than those without
it, thus having more opportunities for cancer detection.
Alternatively, these men with prostate inflammation and
an elevated PSA level are likely to have a lower risk of cancer when compared with men with similar PSA levels and
no inflammation given that the reason for the elevated
PSA is inflammation as opposed to cancer. Consequently,
the ideal design with which to evaluate the association
between prostate inflammation and cancer involves an
approach in which men are selected for rebiopsy regardless
of their PSA levels. The REduction by DUtasteride of
PCa Events (REDUCE) trial is a 4-year, placebo-controlled study evaluating the use of daily dutasteride to
reduce the risk of biopsy-detectable PCa among men with
a negative baseline prostate biopsy.14 Repeat prostate
biopsies were performed at 2 years and 4 years regardless
of PSA values. Thus, REDUCE uniquely allows for the
examination of the relation between inflammatory
changes on baseline-negative biopsies and the subsequent
risk of PCa detection independent of the influence of
changes in PSA levels. Therefore, we evaluated whether
baseline acute and chronic prostate inflammation as well
as inflammation severity among men with an initial negative biopsy for PCa were associated with the risk of subsequent PCa detection among men in the REDUCE trial.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The design of the REDUCE study was published previously.14 In brief, eligible men were those aged 50 years to
75 years who had a serum PSA level  2.5 ng=mL or 3.0
ng=mL according to age (50 years-60 years and 60 years75 years, respectively) but 10 ng=mL, and a single negaCancer

tive prostate biopsy (6 to 12 core needle biopsy specimens) within 6 months of enrollment. Men were
excluded if they had history of PCa, high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical small acinar proliferation, a
prostate volume (PV) > 80 mL, had undergone previous
prostate surgery, or had an International Prostate Symptom Score  25 or  20 while receiving a-blockers. Medical history was collected at baseline. All men were
randomized in a double-blind fashion to receive either
dutasteride at a dose of 0.5 mg or placebo orally daily and
be followed every 6 months for 4 years. To maintain the
blinded nature of the study, PSA levels in the men treated
with dutasteride were doubled (given that dutasteride
reduces PSA levels by approximately 50%15) and randomly adjusted by 0.1 ng=mL so that the final reported
values were equally even and odd. PV was measured by
ultrasonography at the time of randomization and 2 years
and 4 years later. Ten-core, transrectal, ultrasound-guided
biopsies were performed as part of the protocol at 2 years
and 4 years regardless of changes in PSA. Baseline biopsies
had been performed before the start of the study (and independently of the study) and were reread centrally. Biopsies that were performed as part of the study were also read
centrally. The central pathology laboratory had no access
to the randomization codes. PCa and acute and chronic
prostate inflammation were coded as present or absent.
Inflammation was also coded based on severity as mild,
moderate, and marked based on the average cell density
and the extent of tissue involvement in each biopsy core
specimen. Chronic inflammation consisted mainly of
lymphocytes and a variable number of plasma cells and
macrophages. Acute inflammation consisted of a neutrophilic infiltrate. Mild inflammation was defined as small
scattered or patchy aggregates and the presence of nests of
inflammatory cells, usually no more than 10 to 15 cells
per nest. Moderate inflammation was characterized by
larger aggregates and nests, usually > 15 cells, and was
invariably multifocal. Moderate inflammation was noticeable at low magnification. Sheets of inflammatory cells or
extensive multifocal confluent masses of cells were noted
in severe inflammation, which was obvious and noticeable
at any magnification. Additional criterion for severe acute
inflammation was tissue destruction of any size.16 The
protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board
at each research site, and all participants provided written
informed consent. Of the 8231 men enrolled in the study,
6316 had a per-protocol 2-year prostate biopsy. The
details of the men who underwent at least 1 on-study biopsy have been published previously.17 Of these men, 78
(1%) were excluded because of missing data regarding 1

Statistical Analysis

log of the dependent variable and covariates, independence of the errors, homoscedasticity of the errors, and normality of the error distribution were verified for all
models. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata
10.1 statistical software (StataCorp, College Station,
Tex). A P value < .05 was considered to indicate statistical
significance.

Univariable comparisons of baseline characteristics
between men with baseline prostate inflammation were
performed using the chi-square test for categorical data
and the Student t test for continuous variables. The association between acute and chronic inflammation in baseline
prostate biopsies with positive 2-year and 4-year repeat biopsy was evaluated using the chi-square test in univariable
analysis. To test the multivariable association between
baseline inflammation and positive 2-year and 4-year
repeat biopsy results, we used logistic regression controlling for pre-repeat biopsy data including age (continuous,
in years), race (white, black, Asian, American Hispanic, or
other), body mass index (BMI; continuous and logtransformed, in kg=m2), digital rectal examination (DRE;
coded as normal or abnormal), PV (continuous and logtransformed, in cm3), PSA (continuous, in ng/mL), and
treatment arm (dutasteride or placebo). All covariates
were determined before the repeat biopsy was performed.
We also performed 2 sensitivity analyses: the first stratified our sample according to baseline PSA (2.5-4.0
ng=mL, 4.1-7.0 ng=mL, and 7.0-10.0 ng=mL) and the
second was restricted to the placebo arm only. The
assumptions of linearity of the relationship between the

cm,3 respectively. A total of 5721 men (91.7%) were
white. An abnormal DRE was identified in 236 men
(3.8%). At baseline biopsy, acute and chronic inflammation were detected in 938 cases (15%) and 4823 cases
(77%), respectively. A total of 892 baseline biopsies
(14%) showed both acute and chronic inflammation. The
presence of baseline acute and chronic inflammation was
found to be significantly associated with each other
(P < .001). Men with acute inflammation at the time of
baseline biopsy were significantly younger, had lower PSA
levels, and had smaller prostates (all P < .01), whereas
men with chronic inflammation were significantly older
and had larger prostate glands (all P < .01). Both types of
inflammation were found to be unrelated to race, BMI,
DRE, and treatment arm (Table 1).
The number of positive-per-protocol, 2-year repeat
prostate biopsies was 900 (14%). Of the 4574 men
(73.3%) who underwent a per-protocol 4-year repeat
prostate biopsy, 440 (10%) of these biopsies were positive

of the covariates analyzed. This resulted in a final study
sample of 6238 men. Of these men, a total of 4574
(73.3%) also had undergone a per-protocol 4-year prostate biopsy and were included in the 4-year biopsy
analysis.

for PCa. At the 2-year biopsy, both acute and chronic
inflammation were found to be significantly associated
with a lower risk of PCa on univariable analysis (odds ratio [OR], 0.65 [P < .001] and OR, 0.61 [P < .001],
respectively). Baseline acute prostate inflammation was
associated with an absolute decrease in the risk of cancer
detection at the 2-year repeat biopsy of nearly 5% (from
15.3% for those without acute inflammation to 10.4%
for those with acute inflammation). Similarly, baseline
chronic inflammation was associated with an absolute
decrease in the risk of cancer detection at the 2-year repeat
biopsy of 6.7% (from 19.7% for those without chronic
inflammation to 13.0% for those with acute inflammation). On multivariable analysis, both acute (OR, 0.75;
P 5 .012) and chronic (OR, 0.65; P < .001) inflammation were found to be independently associated with a
lower risk of PCa (Table 2). However, at the 4-year biopsy, only acute inflammation was found to be significantly associated with a lower risk of PCa on both
univariable (OR, 0.69; P 5 .017) and multivariable (OR,
0.71; P 5 .031) analyses. Chronic inflammation was not
found to be associated with positive biopsy on either univariable (OR, 0.90; P 5 .392) or multivariable (OR, 0.98;
P 5 .870) analysis at the 4-year repeat biopsy.
The analysis of inflammation severity was not possible for moderate acute inflammation or marked acute and
chronic inflammation due to low numbers. Nevertheless,
mild baseline acute inflammation was associated with a
lower risk of positive 2-year and 4-year repeat prostate biopsy (all P < .05 except for multivariable analysis at the 4year biopsy, at which P 5 .055). Mild and moderate baseline chronic inflammation were associated with a lower

risk of a positive 2-year repeat biopsy (all P < .05) and
were found to be unrelated to the risk of cancer detection
in the 4-year prostate biopsy (Table 3).
Because some studies have suggested that histological prostate inflammation is associated with elevated PSA
levels13 and men are selected for prostate biopsy based on
elevated PSA levels, it is conceivable that these men with
inflammation potentially had a lower risk of PCa because
the elevation of their baseline PSA was due to inflammation rather than cancer. Therefore, we performed a sensitivity analysis stratifying our sample according to baseline
PSA (2.5-4.0 ng=mL, 4.1-7.0 ng=mL, and 7.0-10.0
ng=mL). In this analysis, both acute and chronic inflammation were found to be significantly associated with a
lower risk of PCa on univariable analysis (data not shown)
at 2-year biopsy. Similarly, when only patients randomized to the placebo arm (N 5 3148) were included in univariable analysis, chronic inflammation was found to be
significantly associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer
at the 2-year biopsy (OR, 0.61; P < .001) and there was a
trend toward a lower risk of cancer detection among those
with acute inflammation (OR, 0.77; P 5 .067).
DISCUSSION
Although the causes of prostate inflammation are to the
best of our knowledge poorly understood, acute and
chronic inflammatory infiltrates are frequently observed
in prostate biopsies. Previous studies have indicated that
between 35% to 100% of prostate biopsies performed for
concern about PCa had some histological evidence of
inflammation.18-21 The variability in prevalence is likely
due to the fact that inflammation is not routinely

evaluated or reported by pathologists. In the current
study, in which inflammation was systematically evaluated, approximately 15% of baseline negative biopsies
for PCa demonstrated evidence of acute inflammation,
whereas 77% had histological findings compatible with
chronic inflammation. These results are in agreement
with studies indicating that inflammation is an extremely
common histological finding in prostate biopsies, even
when there are no clinical signs of prostatitis. Moreover,
the results of the current study suggest that inflammation
should be routinely evaluated and reported in prostate
biopsies.
The clinical significance of histological prostate
inflammation is controversial. There is some evidence
suggesting a relationship between prostate inflammation
and the degree of lower urinary tract symptoms.22 However, the association between prostate inflammation with
the development, diagnosis, and even management of
PCa remains the subject of much debate. For example,
several authors have demonstrated a positive correlation
between urogenital infection, prostatitis, and sexually
transmitted disease with PCa.7,8,23 Conversely, more
recent data have suggested that histological inflammation
in the biopsy specimen may actually be associated with a
decreased risk of PCa detection in subsequent biopsies.12,24,25 In our cohort of 6238 men undergoing repeat
prostate biopsy after negative baseline biopsy, baseline
acute and chronic inflammation were both found to be independently associated with a lower risk of PCa. At the 2year repeat biopsy, both baseline acute and chronic
inflammation were significantly associated with a nearly
35% to 40% reduction in the diagnosis of PCa. At the
194

4-year repeat biopsy, acute baseline inflammation was
associated with a significant reduction in the risk of PCa
by approximately 30%. Thus, if these findings are confirmed in future studies, a more selective rebiopsy strategy
would be reasonable in men who had histological inflammation in a prostate biopsy that was negative for cancer.
Despite the evidence linking inflammation to specific types of cancer, the traditional teaching indicates that
the inflammatory and immune systems can inhibit carcinogenesis by reacting against tumor-specific and tumorassociated antigens.26 This process is called immunosurveillance, in which the hostâ€™s immune system recognizes
the transformed malignant cells as foreign agents and
eliminates them before they can become an established tumor. Thus, it is conceivable that inflammation may correlate with immunosurveillance, leading to a favorable
immunomodulation that could potentially explain why
inflammation was associated with a lower risk of PCa in
repeat prostate biopsies in the current study. If this hypothesis is true, our results support inflammation, immunosurveillance, and immunomodulation as potential areas
in which therapies for preventing and treating PCa could
be developed.
The presence of confounding factors could possibly
be the reason why inflammation and lower PCa risk are
related. For example, PSA selection for prostate biopsy
may pose a potential bias. Given that some studies have
suggested histological prostate inflammation to be associated with elevated PSA19,27 and that men are traditionally
selected for prostate biopsy based on their PSA levels, men
with inflammation would therefore appear to have a lower
risk of PCa (ie, their elevated PSA was due to
Cancer

inflammation rather than cancer). To minimize this
potential bias, we adjusted our analysis to PSA values.
Moreover, men with inflammation had a lower PSA than
those without it and men were rebiopsied regardless of PSA
values. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis stratifying patients based on baseline PSA values and the results
were virtually unchanged. Thus, although the biological
link between inflammation and reduced PCa risk is not elucidated by the present study, from a clinical standpoint,
inflammation in a negative biopsy for PCa may lower the
risk of subsequent PCa detection on repeat biopsies. Furthermore, the association between inflammation and lower
risk of PCa appears to be independent of PSA levels.
The REDUCE study has many strengths, including
its large international and multicentric population, perprotocol biopsies regardless of PSA levels, prospective
data acquisition, and central pathology review. The main
limitation of the current study is that only men with PSA
values between 2.5 ng=mL and 10 ng=mL were selected.
In addition, men with high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia, atypical small acinar proliferation, or a PV > 80 mL
or those who had undergone previous prostate surgery or
had an International Prostate Symptom Score  25 or
 20 while receiving a-blockers were excluded. Although
these exclusions increase the homogeneity of the sample,
they limit the generalizability of our results. We did not
consider off-protocol biopsies, including transrectal=transperineal needle biopsies, transurethral resections, and
prostatectomies of any kind. In addition, men were followed for 4 years and therefore we were unable to study
the long-term consequences of prostate inflammation on
PCa risk. In addition, we were unable to determine why
chronic inflammation did not remain significantly inversely associated with cancer at the time of 4-year biopsy.
We did not evaluate tumor grade in the current study.
Lastly, the limited number of nonwhite men prevented us
from exploring whether race influenced the association
between inflammation and PCa risk.
Among men undergoing repeat prostate biopsy after
an initial negative baseline biopsy, baseline acute and
chronic inflammation were both found to be independently associated with a lower risk of PCa at the 2-year biopsy. At the 4-year biopsy, acute baseline inflammation
was associated with a lower PCa risk. Whether these associations are driven by a false PSA increase suggesting a
higher PCa risk than actually exists or a direct biological
link between inflammation and reduced PCa carcinogenesis is unclear. From a clinical standpoint, inflammation
in a negative biopsy for PCa may lower the risk of subsequent PCa detection on repeat biopsy.
