BACKGROUND. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rapidly progressive lethal tumor. Treatment options remain limited and the outcome in recurrent disease is poor.

METHODS. A Phase II open-label noncomparative study was conducted to assess
the safety and efficacy of the triplet combination irinotecan, cisplatin, and mitomycin-C (IPM) chemotherapy in untreated patients and in those with previous
exposure to chemotherapy.

RESULTS. In 62 patients an objective response rate of 25% was observed. In the
first-line setting progression-free survival measured 6.4 months (95% confidence

interval [CI]: 4.5–7.3) and overall survival was 10.8 months (95% CI: 7.9–13.7). In
the second-line setting progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI: 3.4–
11.2) and overall survival was also 7.3 months (95% CI: 4.8–9.8). Psychosocial
well-being improved during chemotherapy and the main toxicity observed was
neutropenia (40%).

alignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rapidly lethal malignancy causally associated with exposure to asbestos with a
prevalence that is set to increase significantly in the US and Europe
over the next 20 years.1–3 MPM is often refractory to cytotoxic treatment, which may be due to intrinsic apoptosis resistance; a variety
of single agents achieve low response rates of around 20%.4–7
No reported randomized trial has yet confirmed a benefit of
chemotherapy over best supportive care, although 1 trial, MSO-1
(active symptom control vs vinorelbine vs mitomycin/cisplatin/vinblastine), is currently enrolling patients.8 Two Phase III randomized
trials comparing either the ‘gold standard’ doublet pemetrexed (Alimta)
and cisplatin,6,9,10 or raltitrexed (Tomudex) and cisplatin11,12 versus
cisplatin alone confirmed a survival advantage for both doublets.13
The efficacy of radical surgery is not yet proven due to a lack of randomized evidence,14 and radical radiotherapy, although providing
palliative benefit, does not improve overall survival.15 There exists
only a paucity of reports of second-line therapy of MPM, thus warranting further investigation.
First-line chemotherapy with irinotecan (Campto) and cisplatin
produces limited objective tumor responses in MPM.16 Several
groups have reported the use of irinotecan in combination with cisplatin in nonsmall cell lung cancer17–20 and it has also been used in

several other tumor types including gastric,21 neuroendocrine,22 and renal cancers.23 As mitomycin exhibits single-agent objective response in MPM,24 we
explored the clinical activity of the triplet combination irinotecan, cisplatin, and mitomycin in MPM in
the first-line setting. As second-line chemotherapy in
individuals with MPM is underinvestigated, we also
evaluated the efficacy of IPM in previously treated
patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Methods
Between September 2000 and March 2003, patients
with MPM were enrolled into a single-center trial of
combined irinotecan, cisplatin, and mitomycin C
(IPM). The study had appropriate institutional ethical
review board approval and all patients provided written, informed consent. All recruited individuals were
required to have measurable, histologically confirmed,
inoperable, MPM and to be >18 years old, with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance
statuses (PS) of 0 to 2 and no uncontrolled cardiac or
hepatic disease. Individuals with concurrent malignancies of another type (other than nonmelanoma skin
cancer) were excluded. Hematologic and biochemical
criteria included adequate bone marrow function (total
leukocyte count >4  109 cell/L, platelet count >100 
109 cells/L, and hemoglobin >10 g/dL) and hepatic
function (alkaline phosphatase <1.5 times the upper
limit of normal). Prophylactic superficial irradiation of
chest drain or biopsy scars was allowed before commencement of chemotherapy, provided the patient had
measurable disease outside the irradiated site. All
patients had computed tomography (CT) chest scans
performed at the time of enrolment and, where possible, pleural effusions were drained before beginning
therapy. The International Mesothelioma Interest Group
(IMIG) staging system was used25 and all patients in the
second-line cohort had documented disease progression, having previously received chemotherapy with a
different regimen.
Treatment was administered on an outpatient
basis as follows: intravenous (i.v.) irinotecan 100 mg/
m2, cisplatin 40 mg/m2, mitomycin-C 6 mg/m2
administered on Day 1, with irinotecan 100 mg/m2,
cisplatin 40 mg/m2 administered on Day 15 of a 28day cycle. Patients in the second-line setting or those
with a PS of 2 were treated with irinotecan 70 mg/
m2. Antiemetic granisetron 1 mg i.v. and dexamethasone 8 mg i.v. were coadministered routinely with
each cycle. Blood cell counts and chemistry panels
were repeated with every treatment. Treatment was
delayed by 1 week in the event of bone marrow

suppression (total leukocyte count <3  109 cells/L,
neutrophil count <1.5  109 cells/L, or platelet count
<100  109 cells/L).

Assessment of Response
Patients were assessed for response by thoracic CT
scans after each cycle of chemotherapy. Although there
is debate regarding the best assessment of response in
MPM,5 we used the newer guidelines to evaluate the
response to treatment in solid tumors (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, RECIST26). If there
were no separately identifiable mass lesions then the
thickness of the circumferential pleural tumor was
measured at 3 separate levels on transverse sections, as
previously described for the assessment of response to
treatment in mesothelioma. The sum of the measurements was taken as the baseline sum longest diameter
and repeat measurements were made at the same
levels on subsequent scans.
Duration of response was defined as the interval
from the time that the criteria for partial response
(PR) were first met to the time that criteria for progressive disease were first met, taking as reference
the smallest sum longest diameter recorded since
treatment started. Duration of stable disease (SD)
was defined as the interval from the start of treatment to the time that criteria for progressive disease
were first met, taking as reference the smallest sum
longest diameter recorded since treatment started.
Quality of Life
Quality of life was assessed in all patients at baseline
(before chemotherapy) and subsequently at 8 and 12
weeks. The Rotterdam Symptom Check-List (RSCL)
was used,27 as it has been found to be useful previously in individuals with MPM.28–30 A single questionnaire covered general and respiratory symptoms,
psychologic well-being, and physical activity. Patient
scores of improvement, deterioration, or no change
in quality-of-life indices were collated individually
and recorded.
Statistical Considerations
An objective response of at least 20% was considered
sufficient to encourage further investigation of IPM,
and conventional statistical considerations indicate
that an open study of 14 patients would have a 95%
chance or greater of detecting at least 1 response if
the true response were 20% or greater. If at least 1
response occurred in the first 14 patients, it was
planned to increase the number of patients to assess
the response rate with more precision up to a total
of 62 individuals. The Kaplan-Meier method was
used to calculate progression-free survival (PFS) and

overall survival (OS) using the product limit estimator.31 For survival distributions stratified according to
objective tumor response, comparison employed the
log-rank statistical test. For quality of life analysis,
the changes between RSCL scores (within patient) at
the different time points were compared using the
Wilcoxon signed ranks test.

RESULTS
Patient Characteristics: First- and Second-line IPM
Forty-nine patients were enrolled for treatment with
IPM as first-line chemotherapy and 13 were enrolled
for treatment with IPM in the second-line setting. Of
these 13 patients, previous regimens received were
vinorelbine (9 patients), vinorelbine/oxaliplatin (3 patients), and cisplatin/pemetrexed (1 patient). The median interval between the end of the first course and
the start of the second was 6 months. Responses to
non-IPM first-line therapy included 2 patients who
had PRs (15%), 6 with SD (46%), and 5 patients with
progressive disease (PD; 39%). A summary of patient
characteristics for the first- and second-line studies is
provided in Table 1.
Objective Responses: First-line IPM
In patients treated first-line with IPM, objective
responses were measurable in 43 patients (6 were
unevaluable), as summarized in Table 1A. No complete remissions were observed. PRs were observed
in 16 (37%) patients, with SD in 23 (54%) patients,
and PD seen in 4 (9%) patients. A typical response to
PR is shown in Figure 2A,B.
Progression-Free and Overall Survival: First-line IPM
Of the patients receiving first-line IPM, 44 were evaluable for PFS (5 patients were censored). Median
PFS from first treatment was 6.4 months (95% CI:
4.5–7.3), as shown in Figure 1A. In all, 59 patients
were evaluable for survival, of which 17 were censored. The median OS from first treatment was 10.8
months (95% confidence limits were 7.9–13.7 months),
as shown in Figure 1B.
Objective Responses: Second-line IPM
In patients receiving second-line IPM, there were no
complete responses. PRs were seen in 2 of 10 evaluable patients (20%), of whom 1 patient originally had
stable disease after 12 cycles of vinorelbine. Two
patients had previously progressed after 4 and 12
cycles of vinorelbine, respectively. SD was observed in
5 patients (50%) and progressive disease in 2 patients

IPM stratified according to histologic subtype.

Progression-Free and Overall Survival: Second-line IPM
In patients receiving second-line IPM, the median
PFS was 7.3 months (95% CI: 3.4–11.2) as shown in
Figure 1C. OS from the first cycle of IPM was 7.3
months (95% CI: 4.8–9.8) as shown in Figure 1D. Median OS from commencement of first-line chemotherapy to death after second-line IPM was 15.1
months (n ¼ 13, 95% confidence limits were 2.5–27.7
months), as shown in Figure 2B.
Dose Intensity and Toxicity
There were no treatment-related deaths. In the firstline setting, observed grade 1/2 toxicities were: malaise in 10 patients, neutropenia in 10 patients, anemia in 5 patients, thrombocytopenia in 3 patients,
nausea and vomiting in 3 patients, neuropathy in 2
patients, and mucositis in 2 patients. Grade 3/4 toxicities were: neutropenia in 25 patients, leucopenia in
4 patients, thrombocytopenia in 3 patients, diarrhea
in 2 patients, and malaise in 1 patient. In the secondline setting, grade 1/2 toxicities were: malaise in 10
patients and neutropenia in 3 patients. Grade 3/4
toxicities were: neutropenia in 4 patients, anemia in

There were no significant differences in toxicity profiles between the first- and second-line administration of IPM. In the first-line setting, 3 or more cycles
of chemotherapy were received by 32 (65%) patients

Quality of Life
All patients were asked to complete the RSCL questionnaire immediately before treatment (baseline)
and at 8 and 12 weeks after treatment began on the
day that chemotherapy was administered. No information was available on change over time in RSCL
for 25% of the patients (21% baseline only, 5% did
not provide RSCL scores at any time). Among the
remaining 74% of patients, 49% had RSCL measured
at both 8 and 12 weeks. Psychological well-being had
improved between baseline and Week 8 (P ¼ .02),
although the subsequent changes between Week 8
and Week 12 were not statistically significant. Physical symptoms showed little difference between baseline and Week 8, with approximately equal numbers
of patients improving or deteriorating. However,
between Weeks 8 and 12, two-thirds of patients found
their physical symptoms worsened (P ¼ .005). Activity
scores showed no statistically significant pattern of
improvement or deterioration over time. Despite worsening of physical symptoms, when patients were
asked to give an overall evaluation of their quality of
life at baseline, 8 weeks and 12 weeks, the majority

found it excellent, with only 3 or 4 patients describing
it as poor (Fig. 3).

DISCUSSION
IPM demonstrates useful clinical activity in MPM, is
well tolerated in the first- and second-line settings,
and is associated with evidence of symptomatic benefit. Although it is difficult to compare between this
study and the previous Phase II and III trials, there is
now extensive previous experience in MPM with
doublets giving a wide range of outcomes, and these
triplet data are at the top of this range. We suggest
that a randomized study comparing the triplet and
doublet approaches is warranted and, in addition, as
the responses and survival outcomes in the small
second-line cohort here were notable and the toxicities were reasonable, IPM is worthy of study in a larger
Phase II study in this group experiencing recurrence.
There are few published clinical trials examining
the efficacy of chemotherapy in the second-line setting in MPM32,33 and we found that IPM exhibits

moderate activity in previously treated patients,
with an objective response rate of 20%, tumor stabilization of 50%, and an OS of 7.3 months; patients
survived on average for 15.1 months from first treatment. It appears that IPM may be extending survival; however, patient selection could account for
this apparently longer survival time. All of the patients
receiving IPM in the second-line setting were classified as low-risk according to the EORTC prognostic
score5 and the median survival of this low-risk group
is higher than for high-risk, and therefore suggests
some degree of selection bias. It is not known what
survival of low-risk patients might be in the absence
of chemotherapy, an important question that may
be answered by the MSO-1 Phase III clinical trial.
Such bias may underlie the perceived effectiveness
of all therapies, including extrapleural pneumonectomy,
that have yet to be validated by randomized trials.
The use of IPM, which is now routine in patients
with MPM at our institution, derives from a number
of previous studies. The highest response rates have
generally been observed with cisplatin-containing

liative setting, only limited evidence exists on which
to base recommendations.6,7 In summary, IPM is a
well-tolerated regimen with measurable activity both
in the first- and second-line settings and warrants
further investigation.

(60 mg/m2 on Day 1), in a 28-day schedule to 15
patients leading to a partial response rate of 26.7%
with a PFS of 5.3 months and OS of 7 months. Mitomycin-C, bioreduced under hypoxic conditions, has
been explored in combination with cisplatin in a
nude mouse xenograft model.35 A randomized Phase
II conducted by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B
treated 35 patients with cisplatin and mitomycin or
doxorubicin.36 Cisplatin and mitomycin was associated with a response rate of 26%, compared with
14% for the cisplatin and doxorubicin doublet; the
PFS was 3.6 months and OS 7.7 months, respectively,
with no differences between arms.
As the incidence of MPM is increasing, we are
faced with the challenge of treating more patients,
including those with recurrence. Agents that are
active in the first-line setting are not necessarily
active later,37 and the diffuse nature of the disease
implies a limited role for both surgical and radiotherapeutic techniques, and thus further impact will be
made using combination cytotoxic regimens. Despite
many efforts on the use of chemotherapy in the pal-
