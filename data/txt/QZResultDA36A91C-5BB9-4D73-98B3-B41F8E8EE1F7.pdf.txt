ABSTRACT
The blossom of immunotherapy in melanoma highlights the need to delineate
mechanisms of immune resistance. Recently, we have demonstrated that the RNA editing
protein, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA-1 (ADAR1) is down-regulated during
metastatic transition of melanoma, which enhances melanoma cell proliferation and
tumorigenicity. Here we investigate the role of ADAR1 in melanoma immune resistance.
Importantly, knockdown of ADAR1 in human melanoma cells induces resistance
to tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in a cell contact-dependent mechanism. We show
that ADAR1, in an editing-independent manner, regulates the biogenesis of miR-222
at the transcription level and thereby Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1)
expression, which consequently affects melanoma immune resistance. ADAR1 thus
has a novel, pivotal, role in cancer immune resistance. Corroborating with these
results, the expression of miR-222 in melanoma tissue specimens was significantly
higher in patients who had no clinical benefit from treatment with ipilimumab as
compared to patients that responded clinically, suggesting that miR-222 could
function as a biomarker for the prediction of response to ipilimumab.
These results provide not only novel insights on melanoma immune resistance,
but also pave the way to the development of innovative personalized tools to enable
optimal drug selection and treatment.

(CTLA4) mAb (ipilimumab) for the indication of metastatic
melanoma, based on significant improved overall survival in
Phase III trials [4, 5]. Recent clinical trials with PD1 [6–8] or
PD-L1 blocking antibodies [9] showed impressive effects,
leading to FDA approval of anti-PD1 drugs pembrolizumab
and nivolumab in 2014. Combination of ipilimumab and
PD1 blockade yield dramatic effects with ~80% 2-year
survival, but with very high toxicity [10]. In addition,
adoptive cell transfer using autologous tumor infiltrating
lymphocytes (TILs) has shown impressive results in about
40% of the patients [11–13]. Since metastatic melanoma
uses many mechanisms to escape the immune system [2],

INTRODUCTION
Malignant melanoma, arising from pigment pro­
ducing melanocytes, is among the most aggressive and
treatment-resistant human cancers. The incidence of
melanoma in Caucasian populations has been increasing
at a higher rate than any other malignancy [1].
Metastatic melanoma responds poorly to conven­tional
chemotherapies and predicts poor survival rates. Melanoma
is considered as an immunogenic tumor, expressing a
variety of tumor associated antigens [2, 3]. In 2011 the FDA
approved anti- cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4

delineation of mechanisms involved in melanoma immuneresistance is of cardinal importance.
RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism
through which RNA sequences are directly altered.
Specific adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) editing is catalyzed
by members of the family of adenosine deaminases that
act on RNA (ADARs). ADARs convert adenosines to
inosines in double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) substrates by
hydrolytic deamination of the adenine base. In mammals,
three ADAR proteins have been identified: ADAR1 and
ADAR2 are detected in many tissues, whereas ADAR3
is brain-specific. ADAR1 has two isoforms as a result of
alternative splicing: the longer form (p150) is modulated
mostly by interferon-alpha (IFNα) and found both in
nucleus and cytoplasm, while the shorter form (p110) is
constitutively expressed, but only present in the nucleus
[14]. The splicing and translational machineries recognize
inosine (I) as guanosine (G), resulting in significant
biological effects. Rare events of editing in coding
regions may result in amino acid substitutions [15], while
editing in non-coding regions might affect splicing, RNA
stabilization and nuclear retention [16, 17]. Furthermore,
editing of non-coding RNAs affects their biogenesis or
alters their target gene specificity [18–20].
We have recently reported on a significant decrease
in ADAR1 expression in ~65% of metastatic melanoma
specimens compared to melanocytes [21]. This down
regulation enhances the proliferation of melanoma
cells, probably by controlling the biogenesis pathway
of miRNAs, and thereby their entire expression profile
[21]. Little is known about the role of RNA editing
and ADARs in immune function. Recent studies
have identified ADAR1 as an essential regulator of
hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and suppressor of
interferon signaling [22] and as a dominant player in the
regulation of primary T lymphocytes function during
acute transplant rejection [23].
In the present study we investigate the role of
ADAR1 in the regulation of melanoma immune resistance.
We show that ADAR1, in an editing-independent manner,
transcriptionally regulates the biogenesis of miR-222
and thereby Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (ICAM1)
expression, which consequently affects melanoma immune
resistance. Moreover, we show that miR-222 expression
in melanoma may serve as a biomarker for prediction to
response to immunotherapy, such as ipilimumab.

ADAR1-p110 or empty vector as control (Mock)
(Figure 1C). ADAR1-manipulated cells were used as target
cells for primary TIL cultures (TIL14, TIL51 and TIL52)
and clones (JKF6). ADAR1-KD cells were significantly
more resistant to killing by all TIL cells, in all E:T ratios
tested, as compared to the control (Figure 1B). Importantly,
over-expression of ADAR1 rendered the melanoma cells
more sensitive to all TIL cells tested in different E:T ratios
(Figure 1D). Similar results were obtained with additional
melanoma and TIL cells (Supplementary Figure S1A–S1D).
Previous studies showed that TIL anti-melanoma
activity is HLA-A2 restricted [24]. Melanoma cells, TIL
clone and polyclonal populations used in this study share
the HLA-A2 allele, as described in Materials and Methods
section. Blocking of HLA-A2 with blocking mAb
abrogated completely the killing of HLA-A2(positive)
526mel and 624mel cells by JKF6, TIL14 and TIL52, but
not of HLA-A2(negative) 938mel cells (Supplementary
Figure S2A), attesting that the activity of TILs used in this
study is HLA-A2 specific.
To rule out the possibility that ADAR1 enhances
endogenous melanoma cell resistance to cytotoxicity, its
effect on spontaneous apoptosis was tested by staining
ADAR1-p110 and control cells with AnnexinV and PI.
No effect of ADAR1 on spontaneous apoptosis could be
observed (Supplementary Figure S3A). Further, we have
previously demonstrated that knockdown of ADAR1 has
no effect on induced apoptosis [21]. In addition, IFN-γ
release was measured concomitantly to cytotoxicity.
A substantially reduced secretion of IFN-γ by at least
some of the TILs was demonstrated when co-incubated
with ADAR1-KD cells as compared to control (Figure
1E). Finally, we tested the phosphorylation of ZAP70 (ζ-associated protein of 70 kDa) within TIL cells as
a direct measurement for T cell activation [25]. Indeed,
enhanced phosphorylation of ZAP-70 was observed when
TIL14 cells were incubated with control melanoma cells,
as compared to basal levels (Figure 1F). Remarkably,
phosphorylated ZAP-70 level was significantly lower
when TIL14 cells were incubated with ADAR1-KD cells
as compared to control cells (Figure 1F).
Altogether, these combined observations strongly
suggest that ADAR1 in the melanoma cells protects
melanoma cells by affecting T-cell activation, and not by
altering inherent cell resistance.

and following 5 h incubation (Supplementary Figure S3B,
S3C). To overcome concerns regarding stability and decay
of soluble factors, we performed a cytotoxicity assay using a
two chamber transwell system, allowing passage of solutes,
but not cell migration. ADAR1-KD or Scramble cells were
seeded in the upper well, while TILs and non-manipulated
CFSE-labeled melanoma cells were co-incubated in the
lower well. There were no significant differences in the
killing activity of TIL14 among all tested setups (Figure 2B).
Similar results were obtained with other cells and following
5 h incubation (data not shown). FACS analysis confirmed
that the melanoma cells seeded in the upper well did not
migrate into the lower well (data not shown). These results
point on cell-contact dependent mechanism.
MHC class I expression among ADAR1-KD and
Scramble cells was similar (Figure 2C). The expression of
melanosomal proteins (gp100/MART1) was actually higher

in ADAR1-KD cells as compared to Scramble cells in the
624mel cell system (Figure 2D), but in other melanoma
cell systems there were no significant differences in the
expression of these proteins (Supplementary Figure S1E,
S1F). These observations suggest that altered antigenic
recognition is a less probable explanation.

ADAR1 regulates ICAM1 protein expression
The effect of ADAR1 on immune resistance was
evident in several T cell cultures with different antigenic
specificities (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1).
This, combined with the evidence pointing to cell-contact
dependent mechanism, implies on an adhesive element,
such as ICAM1. Binding of ICAM1 to the CTL integrin

essential step in the formation of the immune synapse

[26] and facilitates T cell activation [27]. Indeed, overexpression of ADAR1 increased ICAM1 expression as
compared to Mock-transfected cells (2.2-fold increase)
(Figure 3A). Expression of LFA-1 on TIL52 and TIL14
bulk cultures and JKF6 clone was confirmed (Figure 3B).
Remarkably, the enhanced killing of ADAR1-transfected
melanoma cells was significantly reduced by a blocking
anti-ICAM1 mAb, in a dose dependent manner
(Figure 3C), while only mild reduction in killing of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

control cells was observed following ICAM1 blocking.
This indicates on a major role of ICAM1 as an effector
molecule of ADAR1 in mediating this phenomenon.

by miR-222 and miR-339 in colorectal cancer cells and

[29]. Remarkably, knockdown of ADAR1 resulted in
a 4-fold up-regulation of hsa-miR-222 (Figure 4A),
while over-expression of ADAR1 reduced hsa-miR-222
expression by more than 2-fold (Figure 4B). Similar
results were obtained for hsa-miR-221 (Figures 4C, 4D)
while the expression level of hsa-miR-339 did not change
(Figures 4E, 4F). 624mel cells were stably transfected
with miR-222 precursor (miR-222 OX; Figure 5A),
miR-221 precursor (miR-221 OX; Figure 5B) or empty
vector (pQCXIP). All cells similarly expressed ICAM1
mRNA (Figures 5C, 5D). At the protein level, overexpression of miR-222 led to the down-regulation of
ICAM1 (Figure 5E), but not of another adhesion molecule,
CEACAM1 (Supplementary Figure S2B). Surprisingly,
over-expression of miR-221 had no effect on ICAM1
(Figure 5F). Functionally, over-expression of miR-222,
but not miR-221, rendered the melanoma cells more
resistant to TIL mediated killing, as compared to control
(Figures 5G, 5H). To confirm direct regulation of ICAM1
by miR-222 but not miR-221, we performed a set of dual
luciferase assays. 293T cells were co-transfected with
miR-222, miR-221 or pQCXIP empty vector as control
and with ICAM1 UTR, ICAM1 UTR MUT or psiCheck2
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

empty vector. Forced expression of miR-222 with ICAM1
UTR construct significantly inhibited the luciferase
activity, while the inhibitory effect was abolished when
the ICAM1 UTR MUT construct was tested (Figure 5I).
miR-221 did not affect the luciferase activity and was
similar to that observed with the control pQCXIP empty
vector (Figure 5I). These results reinforce our previous
results (Figure 5E, 5F), suggesting that ICAM1 is a direct
target of miR-222 but not of miR-221.
To further test the role of ICAM1 in the immune
resistance conferred by miR-222, we performed
cytotoxicity assays using blocking α-ICAM1 mAb. While
5 μg/ml of α-ICAM1 significantly reduced the killing of
control cells as compared to isotype control, the antibody
had no significant effect on the killing rate of miR-222OX cells. Interestingly, at this antibody concentration,
blocking of ICAM1 yielded a similar inhibitory effect
as miR-222 over-expression (Figure 5J). Only when we
used an even higher concentration of 10 μg/ml α-ICAM1,
a reduction in killing rates was observed also in miR-222OX cells (Figure 5J).
These results suggest that ADAR1 controls ICAM1
expression at the translation level via miR-222, and

were similar to those observed with the full ADAR1-p110
protein, suggesting that ADAR1 regulates immune
resistance independently of RNA editing.

ADAR1 transcriptionally regulates miR-222

ADAR1 regulates immune resistance
independently of RNA-editing

The biogenesis of miRNAs is a multistep process
tightly controlled by several enzymes and complexes
[33]. We have recently shown that ADAR1 regulates the
miRNA biogenesis pathway [21]. Expression levels of
pri-miR-222 were significantly higher in ADAR1-KD
cells (Figure 7A) and lower in ADAR1-p110 (Figure 7B),
as compared to controls. These observations were similar
to the results of the mature miR-222 expression (Figures
4A, 4B). Moreover, the expression of pri-miR-222 was
lower in ΔCAT-S cells as compared to control (Figure 7C),
suggesting an RNA-editing independent regulation.
Luciferase assays demonstrated reduced activity
of miR-222 putative promoter when co-transfected
with ADAR1 as compared to Mock construct (Figure
7D), suggesting that ADAR1 affects the transcription of
miR-222 precursors. Direct binding of ADAR1 to primiR-222 could not be demonstrated over wide range
of experimental parameters of PCR amplification after
immunoprecipitation of ADAR1 (data not shown).

The role of ADAR1 as an RNA editing enzyme is
well documented [14, 30], however there is very little
evidence on its functions independently of its enzymatic
activity [21, 31, 32]. Sequencing of PCR-amplified primiR-222, from which the mature miR-222 is derived, did
not reveal any A-to-I RNA editing sites or any sequence
differences among the various ADAR1-manipulated cells.
To test the involvement of A-to-I RNA editing in this
phenomenon, a His-tagged ADAR1 construct of ~64 kDa
lacking the deaminase domain (ΔCAT-S) was generated and
stably transfected into 624mel cells (Figure 6A). Expression
levels of hsa-miR-222 were significantly lower (Figure 6B)
and ICAM1 protein expression was higher (Figure 6C),
as compared to control. Moreover, cytotoxicity assays
confirmed that transfection with ΔCAT-S, rendered the
cells significantly more sensitive to TIL-mediated killing
(Figure 6D). Importantly, the effects exerted by ΔCAT-S

of hsa-miR-222 in melanoma tissues of NB patients was

the expression of miR-222 by qRT-PCR in 22 melanoma

response to ipilimumab.

that the immune response plays an important role in the
natural history of the disease, as evidenced by infiltration
of lymphocytes into the tumor and spontaneous regression
of primary melanomas [2, 35]. Yet, metastatic melanoma
employs several, not fully understood, mechanisms to
escape immune surveillance.
We have recently shown that ADAR1 is commonly
down-regulated in metastatic melanoma [21]. Here we
show that down-regulation of ADAR1 renders melanoma
cells more resistant to TIL-mediated killing, in all E:T
ratios tested, which may partially explain why metastatic
melanoma tends to evade the immune system. Tumor cells
can escape immune surveillance by various mechanisms: 1)
tumor-secreted soluble factors; 2) impaired expression of
MHC-I or melanoma antigens; 3) deregulation of adhesion
and co-stimulating molecules; 4) resistance to apoptosis;
and 5) recruitment of immune suppressive cells to the
tumor microenvironment [36–38]. We exclude soluble
factors and altered expression of MHC-I molecules or

as mechanisms for immune resistance following ADAR1
down-regulation. It should be noted that in the 624mel cell
system only, ADAR1-KD enhanced the expression levels
of gp100/MART1, but still these cells were more resistant
to TIL-mediated killing (Figure 2). ADAR1 has no effect
on spontaneous or induced apoptosis (Supplementary
Figure S3A, [21]). The results hint that resistance depends
on cell-cell interaction, pointing to the down-regulation
of co-stimulatory or adhesion molecules. Indeed,
ICAM1 expression, an adhesion molecule, is controlled
by ADAR1. ICAM1-LFA1 interactions are essential
for formation of tumor-T-cell immunological synapse
[26]. Blocking of ICAM1 in ADAR1-overexpressing
cells diminished the enhanced sensitivity to killing, in a
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

dose-dependent manner, supporting the idea that ADAR1mediated immune resistance is attributed to loss or
down-regulation of adhesion molecules, such as ICAM1.
Hamai et al further emphasized the role of ICAM1 in
immune resistance by showing that reduced expression of
ICAM1 in metastatic melanoma, as compared to primary
melanoma, was associated with decreased PTEN activity
and activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, leading to reduced
apoptosis [39]. The reduced IFN-γ release by TIL and
reduced phosphorylation of ZAP-70 following incubation
with ADAR1-KD confirm that knockdown of ADAR1
in target cells protects them from T cells by reducing
T cell activation and not due to altered inherent target cell
resistance. The effect of ADAR1-downregulation on tumor
microenvironment should be investigated in future studies.

ADARs convert adenosines to inosines in dsRNA
substrates [14], including double-stranded miRNAs
precursors [18, 40, 41]. In light of the large number of
proteins targeted by miRNAs, including cell adhesion
molecules [42], we focused on miRNAs that potentially
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

target ICAM1. Recent reports indicate that miR-221,
miR-222 and miR-339 directly target ICAM1 [28, 29,
43]. We show that ADAR1 affects miR-221 and miR-222
expression but not miR-339 expression. The miR-221/222
cluster is over-expressed in many types of cancer including
29008

Oncotarget

pancreatic cancer [44], papillary thyroid carcinoma [45],
prostate carcinoma [46] and metastatic melanoma [47]. In
line with previous reports [28, 43], transfection of miR222 precursor into melanoma cells reduced ICAM1 at the
post-transcriptional level (Figure 5E) and enhanced the
resistance to TIL-mediated killing (Figure 5G), similar
to the effect of ADAR1 knockdown. These findings
concur with a previous work showing that inhibition of
miR-222 in glioma cells leads to recovery of ICAM1
expression and promotes their susceptibility to cytotoxic
T-cells [28]. Interestingly, miR-221 didn’t affect ICAM1
expression (Figure 5F), suggesting that ICAM1 is not a
target for miR-221. Accordingly, miR-221 had no effect on
melanoma cell resistance to T cells (Figure 5H). ICAM1
as a target for miR-221 is a subject of discrepancy; while
some have shown that miR-221 targets ICAM1 3′UTR
[29, 43], others have failed to do so [48] or didn’t find
any prediction for miR-221 binding to ICAM1 [28]. In the
current work, dual luciferase assays showed that ICAM1 is
indeed a target of miR-222 but not of miR-221 (Figure 5I),
despite their shared seed region. The differences may
stem from the diverse cloning methodology of the 3′UTR
(i.e., full or part of the 3′UTR) and of the miR (i.e.,
mature or precursor) and the different cells used in these
experiments. Blocking of ICAM1 in miR-222-OX cell
system suggests that at least part of the inhibitory effect
conferred by miR-222 is mediated by ICAM1. Since high
concentrations of α-ICAM1 Ab led to reduced killing also
in miR-222 OX cells, and as microRNAs can modulate
the expression of hundreds of different mRNAs [49], it
is reasonable to assume that miR-222 targets additional
proteins that can potentially affect immune resistance,
together with ICAM1. Taken together, these results
support an important role for ICAM1 in the immune
resistance conferred by ADAR1-regulated miR-222, but
not by miR-221.
It has been suggested that at least 6% of all human
miRNAs may be subjected to RNA editing [18]. However,
we couldn’t find any editing events in the pri-miR-222
sequence. Experiments conducted with ADAR1 construct
lacking the catalytic domain (ΔCAT-S) show that ADAR1
affects pri-miR-222 and subsequently miR-222 expression
independently of its editing properties. Furthermore, the
effects of ΔCAT-S on ICAM1 expression and on TILmediated killing were similar to the effects exerted by
the full ADAR1 protein. These novel findings suggest
that ADAR1 regulates melanoma immune resistance
independently of RNA-editing, corresponding with very
few reports about ADARs editing-independent activities
[21, 31, 32, 50]. Nonetheless, we cannot exclude the
involvement of RNA editing in immune-tumor interactions,
for example by altering the cell’s proteome profile, which
could directly affect antigenicity, in a similar way somatic
mutations affect formation of neoepitopes [51, 52].
Previous studies showed that ADARs can affect
miRNAs function at different stages of biogenesis leading
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

to their altered processing and thereby modulate their
expression levels in the cell [40, 41, 50] or change the set
of miR targets [19]. Our results show that ADAR1 affects
miR-222 expression at the pri-miR stage (Figures 7A, 7B).
Over-expression of ADAR1 reduced the activity of the
miR-222 promoter (Figure 7D), suggesting transcriptional
regulation of miR-222 expression. Previous reports have
shown that PLZF [47] and proto-oncogene ETS-1 [53]
are transcriptional regulators of miR-222 in melanoma by
direct binding to its putative regulatory region. Our system
failed to show direct binding of ADAR1 to pri-miR-222
suggesting that ADAR1 affects the transcription of miR222 indirectly. Nonetheless, our negative results could be
a result of technical obstacles and thus direct binding of
ADAR1 to pri-miR-222 cannot be completely excluded.
The anti-CTLA-4 mAb ipilimumab is an approved
treatment for metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab facilitates
an improved generation of effector T cells against the
tumor cells [34]. Due to this mechanism of action, it is
impossible to predict who will benefit from this treatment.
We show that miR-222 retrospectively differentiates
between patients that benefited from treatment with
ipilimumab from patients that did not. Indeed, miR-222
was expressed at significantly higher levels (2.3 folds) in
tumors from patients who did not benefit from ipilimumab.
Staining of ICAM1 in tumors from these patients showed
a trend towards higher expression of ICAM1 in patients
who did benefit from ipilimumab, however these results
were not statistically significant, probably due to the small
sample size. To confirm these results, prospective studies
with larger sample size are warranted. Biomarker analyses
were previously reported, indicating on various in-situ
“inflammatory” parameters that differentiate between
patients benefit or not from ipilimumab [54]. Discerning
between two possible mechanisms may not be simplistic:
a) lower miR-222 in patients benefiting from ipilimumab
is secondary to primary tumor immunogenicity leading
to a more inflammatory environment (e.g. IFN) that
upregulates ADAR1, causing the reduction observed in
miR-222. This could probably further enhance ICAM1
and facilitate the inflammatory environment; b) primary
lower miR-222 levels lead to better recognition of
melanoma cells by infiltrating lymphocytes due to higher
ICAM1 expression, leading to secondary enhanced
inflammatory signature. In the current work, we could not
find any differences in infiltration and spatial scattering of
lymphocytes pre-treatment between patients with clinical
benefit from ipilimumab and those without. Similar
results were previously reported by Hamid et al. [55].
The recent publication of Snyder et al. [51] indicating
in a retrospective analysis that benefit from ipilimumab
treatment is linked with higher burden of somatic tumor
mutations causing potentially neoepitopes supports the
first hypothesis. Notably, in the supplementary data of the
comprehensive publication by Ji et al [54], high ICAM1
is reported among the inflammatory signature. Therefore
29009

Oncotarget

our finding that low miR-222 expression pre-treatment is
associated with benefit from ipilimumab fits the currently
available data and provides a mechanistic insight with
clinical relevance.
These results suggest that miR-222 may serve as
a reliable biomarker for the prediction of response to
ipilimumab. Given its role in ICAM1 regulation, it might
also predict response to other immunotherapies currently
investigated such as anti-PD1.
Several cell systems (e.g., ADAR1-KD, ADAR1­
-p110, miR-222 OX etc.) were used in this study. The
differences observed in absolute cytotoxicity between
these cell systems may stem from the different vectors. In
addition, there is known inter-experimental variability in the
absolute TIL cytotoxicity activity due to the nature of these
primary cells. It is therefore very hard to provide quantitative
extrapolations based on these different experiments of
different cell systems. Thus, our conclusions and proposed
mechanistic link between ADAR1-miR-222-ICAM1
and immune resistance are based on comparison to the
appropriate controls using the same cells and vectors, dosedependent antibody blocking and effector-to-target ratios.
In conclusion, our group has recently shown
that ADAR1 has a fundamental role in regulating the
aggressiveness of melanoma, and it is downregulated
along melanoma progression [21]. Others have shown
that miR-222 expression increases along with melanoma
progression, to induce a more tumorigenic phenotype
[47]. Induction of ICAM1 in resistant melanoma cells
is sufficient to restore the susceptibility of tumor cells
to the CTL-mediated death [39]. Together with the new
mechanistic findings presented in this report, ADAR1 and
miR-222 may serve as good targets for the treatment of
melanoma.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Generation of stable expression cell systems
The ADAR1 knockdown system is based on shRNA
oligonucleotides subcloned into pSuper.puro vector. The
ADAR1 over-expression and His-tagged constructs were
subcloned into pCDNA3.1.neo vector. The miR-222
and miR-221 precursors constructs were subcloned into
pQCXIP.puro vector. The detailed list of primers used for
the generation of all constructs appears in Supplementary
Table S1. Transfections were performed using Turbofect
(Fermentas, cat#R0531) according to manufacturer’s
instructions. Retroviral transductions were performed as
previously described [56, 57]. All transfectants were tested
routinely for expression.

RNA isolation and reverse transcription
Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (SigmaAldrich, cat#T9424), and cDNA was generated by Highcapacity reverse transcriptase kit (Applied Biosystems,
cat#4374966) using random hexamer primers or Univer­
sal Transcriptor cDNA master (Roche Diagnostics,
cat#05893151001), according to manufacturer’s instruc­
tions. cDNA for miRNAs was generated using TaqMan
microRNA custom primers (Applied Biosystems) or
Universal cDNA synthesis kit (Exiqon, cat#203301).

Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)

Cells and media

Primers (Sigma-Aldrich) for different genes
were designed according to Primer-Express software
guidelines (Applied Biosystems). miRNAs expression
was tested using custom TaqMan primers (Applied
Biosystems) or MicroRNA LNA™ PCR primers
(Exiqon). The qRT-PCR reactions were run in triplicates
on ABI7500 system utilizing SDS 1.2.3 Software (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) or LightCycler480 system
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Gene transcripts were
detected using 2X SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems, cat#4309155) or LightCycler480 SYBR
Green I Master (Roche, cat#04-887-352). miRNAs
transcripts were detected using TaqMan Universal PCR
Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, cat#4304437) or SYBR
Green master mix (Exiqon, cat#203400, according to
manufacturer’s instructions. Reactions were normalized
to GAPDH, HPRT or U6 endogenous control. Relative
expression was calculated using 2^(-ΔΔCt) equation, as

(National Cancer Institute), were cultured as previously
described [11]. 293T cells (ATCC) were maintained
in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM)
(Biological Industries, cat#01-055-1A) with 10% FBS.
The generated stable cell lines were cultured similarly
with addition of 1 μg/ml of puromycine (Merck Millipore,
cat#540411) or 2mg/ml G418 (Alexis Biochemicals,

(Costar, cat#3421). 50K CFSE-labeled melanoma cells
and given amounts of effector cells were placed in the
lower wells below the permeable membrane. After 5 h or
overnight incubation, killing rate in the lower well was
assessed as described above.

LDH cytotoxicity assays
Cytotoxicity assays were performed by measuring
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, according to
manufacturer’s instructions (CytoTox 96, Promega,
cat#G1780). Briefly, target cells were co-incubated
overnight with effector cells at different E:T ratios in a 96well plate. 45 min prior to harvesting supernatants, 10 μl
of lysis solution was added to a group of wells to obtain
maximum LDH release. Plates were centrifuged and 50 μl
of supernatants were transferred to a fresh 96-well plate.
50 μl of LDH substrate mix were added to each well and
plates were incubated covered at room temperature. After
30 min, 50 μl of stop buffer were added to each well. The
LDH release was estimated by using a microplate reader
(GloMax, Promega, Madison, WI) at 490 nm. For blocking
assays, target cells were pre-incubated for 1 h on ice with
different concentrations of anti-Human ICAM1 monoclonal
mouse IgG1 antibody (R&D Systems, cat#BBA3) or mouse
IgG1 isotype control (BioXCell, cat#BE0083), followed by
9 h cytotoxicity assays. All experiments were performed in
triplicate wells. (E:T) represents the ratio between effector
(TILs) and target (melanoma cells). Percent of specific lysis
of target cells was calculated using the equation:

Quantification of IFN-γ secretion
624mel ADAR1-KD or Scramble cells were
co-incubated with TILs for 5 h. Following incubation,
the amount of IFN-γ in supernatants was evaluated
by standardized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) (R&D Systems, cat#DY285).

Evaluation of ZAP70 phosphorylation
TIL14 were mixed at a 5:1 cell ratio with ice cold
624mel ADAR1-KD or Scramble cells. Following gentle
vortex stimulations were carried for 10 min using a water-bath
at 37°C and terminated with the addition of cold PBS. Cells
were immediately pelleted and lysed by triton based lysis
buffer supplemented with phosphatase and protease inhibitor
cocktails for 30 min on ice. 20 μg of protein from the lysates
were used for subsequent Western Blot (WB), as previously
described [21]. Membranes were exposed to p-ZAP70Y319
primary antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, cat#C-2701S)
overnight at 4°C. For total ZAP70 and load control analysis,
membranes were striped by low pH buffer, blocked and
exposed to ZAP70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat#sc-574)
and actin antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, cat#sc-1616)
for 60 min at room temperature. Exposure was done by a
secondary peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit Ab (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, cat#SC-1616R) and standard ECL reagent
(Pierce, cat#PIR-34077). Revelation and quantification of
WB data was performed using an ImageQuant LAS 500
imager (GE Healthcare) and the image analysis program
Image Studio Digits (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE).

CFSE cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity assays based on CFSE pre-labeling of
target cells and PI co-staining after co-incubation with
the effector cells were performed using flow cytometry,
as previously described [59]. For blocking assays, target
cells were pre-incubated for 1 h on ice with mouse antihuman HLA-A2 antibody (Serotec, Oxford, UK) or
mouse IgG2b isotype control (Serotec), followed by 5 h
cytotoxicity assays. Percent of specific lysis of target
cells was determined after subtraction of background.
Background signal never exceeded 20%. E:T represents the
ratio between effector (TILs) and target (melanoma cells).

Flow cytometry
Staining for extracellular and intracellular proteins
was performed according to standard protocols, as
previously described [58, 59]. Gating of cells was
performed using FSC vs. SSC. Background fluorescence
intensity was set by isotype control or secondary antibody
only stained samples. Staining was determined by
FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA),
and data analysis was performed using FlowJo software
(Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR). The following antibodies
were used: anti human HLA-ABC Antigen-RPE (W6/32)
(DAKO, cat#R7000), Human ICAM1 monoclonal mouse
IgG1 antibody (R&D Systems, cat#BBA3), FITC-Kat4C
(DAKO, cat#F7112), anti-melanoma (gp100, MART1;
Abcam, cat#AB-ab732), Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse
IgG (Life Technologies, cat#A11001), Human CD11aPE (Beckman Coulter, cat#IM1433U), Mouse IgG1/RPE
(DAKO, cat#X0928).

Condition medium and transwell experiments
Conditioned medium (CM) assays were performed
by seeding 300K/well ADAR1-KD or Scramble cells in a
6 well plate. After 24 h, CM was collected. TILs were preincubated for 1 h with ADAR1-KD or Scramble CM. After
1 h, CFSE-labeled melanoma cells were added to the TILs
and co-incubated for 5 h or overnight. Cytotoxicity assay
was performed as described above.
Transwell experiments were performed by seeding
50K/well ADAR1-KD or Scramble cells into the upper
wells of a modified Boyden chamber (pore size 5 μm)

Western blotting

Promoter luciferase assay

WB using ADAR1 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat#H­
PA003890), polyHistidine (R&D Systems, cat#MAB050),
and β-actin (MP Biomedicals, cat#0869100) antibodies was
performed according to manufacturer’s recommendations
and as previously described [21].

A DNA fragment containing the putative promoter
of miR-222 (~2000bp upstream of pre-miR-222) was
amplified and cloned into pGL4.14 vector (Promega).
Primers used for cloning appear in Table SI. 293T cells
were transfected with Turbofect (Fermentas) according to
manufacturer’s instructions and (a) 180ng ADAR1-p110
or Mock construct; (b) 18ng of pGL4.14 empty or
pGL4.14 containing miR-222 putative promoter and; (c)
4ng Renilla. After 48 h, cells were lysed and luciferase
activity was measured with Dual Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) and normalized to Renilla. The
Mock plasmid co-transfected with pGL4.14 empty was
considered as control.

Determination of apoptosis
624mel ADAR1-p110 and Mock cells were stained
with both annexin V–FITC and PI according to the
manufacturer’s instructions (eBioscience, cat#BMS500FI).
Apoptosis rates and data analysis were determined by flow
cytometry as described above.

Immunoprecipitation-PCR

Microarray expression analysis

Procedure was performed as previously described
[21]. Briefly, 293T cells were seeded in five 10cm culture
dishes and transfected with ADAR1 or Carcinoembryonic
antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1)
constructs together with miR-222 precursor construct.
After 48 h, RNA was extracted from one culture dish
using Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) in order to assess
ADAR1, CEACAM1 and pri-miR-222 expression
by qRT-PCR as described above. The remaining cells
were immunoprecipitated using Dynabeads Protein G
(Invitrogen, cat#Dy_10003D) and anti-ADAR (SigmaAldrich) or anti-CEACAM1 (MRG1 [57]) antibodies. At
the end of the precipitation procedure, RNA was extracted
using miRNeasy Kit (Qiagen, cat#217004). Reverse
transcription was obtained using Universal Transcriptor
cDNA master (Roche). Successful transfection and
immunoprecipitation were confirmed by WB. Pri-miR-222
expression following immunoprecipitation was assessed
by qRT-PCR.

Melanoma samples were derived from metastatic
melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab at Sheba
Medical Center (IRB approval in Sheba: 8946-11-smc).
Formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) melanoma
tissues were stained with hematoxilin and eosin (H&E)
for examination by an expert pathologist. Non-tumor
tissue was removed. Total RNA was isolated using
miRNeasy FFPE kit (Qiagen, cat# 217504) according
to the manufacture guidelines. RNA was used as
template to generate a biotin-labeled target that was
processed by an Affymetrix GeneChip Instrument
System (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) according to
manufacturer’s recommendations, as previously described
[21]. Microarray data are accessible through GEO Series
accession number GSE67496 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE674960).

Determination of lymphocytes infiltration and
ICAM1 staining in melanoma specimens

Luciferase reporter assay

H&E-stained slides of melanoma sections described
above, were evaluated by an expert pathologist, blinded to
the experimental groups, and categorized for the presence/
absence of lymphocytes infiltration and spatial scattering
(non-brisk/brisk). Immunohistochemical staining of
ICAM1 (Sigma-Aldrich, cat# HPA002126) was performed
on 4 μm sections of paraffin-embedded tissues according
to standard procedures, as previously described [2121].
Intensity of ICAM1 membrane expression was scored
from 0 (negative) to 3 and percentages of expression were
defined.

The 3′UTR of ICAM1 (ICAM1 UTR; ~1300
bp) was amplified and cloned into psiCheck2 vector
(Promega), downstream of the Renilla luciferase gene.
The firefly luciferase allowed normalization of Renilla
luciferase expression. Three point mutations were inserted
into the predicted binding site of miR-221 and miR-222
(ICAM1 UTR MUT) using QuikChange Site-Directed
Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, cat#200518), according to
manufacturer’s protocol. Primers used for cloning appear
in Table SI. 293T cells were co-transfected with Turbofect
(Fermentas) and with (a) 200 ng of miR-221, miR-222,
or pQCXIP empty vector (as control); and (b) 20 ng of
ICAM1 UTR, ICAM1 UTR MUT or psiCheck2-empty
vector. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and
assayed with Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System
(Promega, cat#1960) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.
