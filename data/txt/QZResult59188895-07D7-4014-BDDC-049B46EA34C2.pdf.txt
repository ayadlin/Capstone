ABSTRACT
ATR and ATM are DNA damage signaling kinases that phosphorylate several
thousand substrates. ATR kinase activity is increased at damaged replication forks
and resected DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). ATM kinase activity is increased
at DSBs. ATM has been widely studied since ataxia telangiectasia individuals who
express no ATM protein are the most radiosensitive patients identified. Since ATM
is not an essential protein, it is widely believed that ATM kinase inhibitors will be
well-tolerated in the clinic. ATR has been widely studied, but advances have been
complicated by the finding that ATR is an essential protein and it is widely believed
that ATR kinase inhibitors will be toxic in the clinic. We describe AZD6738, an
orally active and bioavailable ATR kinase inhibitor. AZD6738 induces cell death and
senescence in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. AZD6738 potentiates the
cytotoxicity of cisplatin and gemcitabine in NSCLC cell lines with intact ATM kinase
signaling, and potently synergizes with cisplatin in ATM-deficient NSCLC cells. In
contrast to expectations, daily administration of AZD6738 and ATR kinase inhibition
for 14 consecutive days is tolerated in mice and enhances the therapeutic efficacy of
cisplatin in xenograft models. Remarkably, the combination of cisplatin and AZD6738
resolves ATM-deficient lung cancer xenografts.

INTRODUCTION

inhibitors in tissue culture [8–10], and it is widely believed
that ATM kinase inhibitors will be well-tolerated in the
clinic as ATM is not an essential protein [7, 11]. However,
ATM kinase inhibition does not phenocopy ATM protein
disruption, and while atm–/– mice that express no ATM
protein are viable, mouse embryos expressing kinaseinactive ATM protein die before embryonic day 9.5–10.5
[12–14]. It is therefore important to investigate the impact
of ATM and ATR kinase inhibitors in preclinical models.
ATR has also been widely studied, but advances
have been complicated by the finding that ATR is an
essential protein in mice and mammalian cells [15–18].

ATR and ATM are apical DNA damage signaling
kinases that phosphorylate a broad and overlapping
catalogue of several thousand substrates [1–3]. ATR
kinase activity is increased at damaged replication forks
and resected DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) [4]. ATM
kinase activity is increased at DSBs [5]. ATM has been
widely studied since individuals with the disease ataxia
telangiectasia, who express no ATM protein, are the most
radiosensitive patients identified [6, 7]. Lung cancer
cells are radiosensitized by pharmacologic ATM kinase

Overexpression of kinase-inactive ATR increases sensitivity
to cisplatin and ionizing radiation (IR) in tissue culture
[19, 20] and, consistent with these data, lung cancer cells are
sensitized to cisplatin and IR by ATR kinase inhibitors in vitro
[21–26]. ATR kinase activity is increased after hypoxia
and ATRi’s sensitize radiation-resistant hypoxic cells to IR
[25, 27–29]. Furthermore, ATR kinase inhibitors synergize
with loss of ERCC1, ATM, XRCC1, and DNA damaging
chemotherapy agents in tissue culture [26, 30, 31]. While
these in vitro data advance ATR kinase inhibitors for the
treatment of lung cancer, there is a pervasive view that ATR
kinase inhibitors will be toxic in the clinic.
VX-970 (also referred to as VE-822), the first
bioavailable ATR kinase inhibitor described, was shown
to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of IR and gemcitabine
in xenograft models of pancreatic cancer [32]. In these
experiments, VX-970 was administered orally daily for
6 consecutive days. VX-970 was also shown to enhance
the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in patient-derived
lung tumor xenografts [33]. In these experiments, VX-970
was administered orally for 4 consecutive days per week.
VX-970 is in clinical trials, but is not orally administered
to human subjects.
Here we describe AZD6738, an orally active and
bioavailable ATR kinase inhibitor that is also in clinical
trials and is orally administered. These trials will assess
safety of AZD6738 alone and in combination with
radiotherapy as well as chemotherapy. We show here
that AZD6738 induces cell death and senescence in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Furthermore,
AZD6378 potentiates the cytotoxicity of cisplatin and
gemcitabine in NSCLC cell lines in which ATM kinase
signaling is intact, and potently synergizes with cisplatin
to kill ATM-deficient NSCLC cells in vitro. We show
that daily administration of AZD6738 for 14 consecutive
days is tolerated in mice and that AZD6738 enhances
the therapeutic efficacy of cisplatin in xenograft models.
Remarkably the combination of cisplatin and AZD6738
resolves ATM-deficient lung cancer xenografts.

and selectivity. A large margin of activity was observed
relative to ATR enzyme isolated activity (0.001 µM)
for most targets tested with the closest targets being
PI3Kδ at 6.8  µM (6800-fold above ATR IC50) and
DYRK at 10.8 µM (10800-fold) (AstraZeneca, personal
communication). Kinase selectivity was also determined
using active-site dependent competition binding assays
against 442 targets at 1 µM AZD6738 with only PI3KC2G
showing any significant inhibition (20%) (Astra Zeneca,
personal communication).
AZD6738 was screened for inhibition of
closely related PI3K target pathway signaling in cell
assays to determine potency and selectivity. A large
margin of activity was observed for all targets tested
relative to inhibition of ATR kinase-dependent kinase
signaling (0.074 µM), with ATM, DNA-PK, and PI3Kα
kinase inhibition all > 30 µM, and mTOR kinase
inhibition > 23 µM (Supplementary Table S1).

AZD6738 inhibits ATR kinase activity and
impairs viability of NSCLC in vitro
We first examined whether AZD6738  has single
agent activity against NSCLC cell lines in vitro. We
assessed ATP levels (using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay) as a surrogate for cell viability
following 48 hour treatment with 0 µM–30 µM AZD6738
in four Kras mutant cell lines: H23, H460, A549, and
H358. AZD6738 impaired viability of these cells lines,
with the lowest GI50 and greatest maximal inhibition in
H460 and H23 cells (1.05 µM, 88.0% and 2.38 µM, 86.2%,
respectively) (Figure 1A, Supplementary Table S2).
We next examined the effects of AZD6738 on DNA
damage response signaling in H23, H460, and A549 cells
(Figure 1B). Following treatment for 24 hours with 0.3
or 1.0 µM AZD6738, ATR kinase activity was inhibited
in all three cell lines, as evident by a decrease in Chk1
phosphorylation (S345) without change in total ATR or
Chk1 protein levels. In p53-wildtype H460 and A549
cells, AZD6738 induced activation of ATM (S1981
phosphorylation), stabilization of p53, and expression of
p21 and p27, in a dose dependent manner. Increased ATM
kinase activity in cells treated with ATR kinase inhibitors
has been reported previously [23, 26]. Importantly,
H23 cells, which possess a missense mutation in ATM
(Q1919P) [34], exhibited minimal total ATM protein and
no phospho-ATM (S1981). Expectedly, AZD6738 did not
induce p21 expression in H23 cells which also harbor a
p53 mutation (M246I) [34]. Similarly, p27 levels remained
largely unchanged in response to treatment. However, H23
and H460, but not A549, exhibited a marked increase in
phospho-H2A.X (S139) and cleaved PARP, indicative of
accumulation of DNA damage and induction of apoptosis,
respectively. This coincides with the observed greater
sensitivity of H23 and H460 in viability assays.

RESULTS
AZD6738 is a highly selective and potent
inhibitor of ATR kinase activity
AZD6738 is a potent inhibitor of ATR kinase
activity with an IC50 of 0.001 µM against the isolated
enzyme and 0.074  µM against ATR kinase-dependent
CHK1 phosphorylation in cells (structure shown in
Figure  1). The identification and characterization of
AZD6738 will be described in detail elsewhere. Briefly,
AZD6738 was screened against a 71 kinase panel
including related PI3K and protein PI3K-like kinases
(ATM, DNA-PK and mTOR) in in vitro isolated enzyme
assays using 32P radioactive assays to determine potency

AZD6738 strongly synergizes with cisplatin in an
ATM-deficient NSCLC cell line in vitro

To better understand whether the effects of
AZD6738 treatment on cell viability persist after relief of
ATR inhibition, we first treated cells with 0.3 or 1.0 µM
AZD6738 for 48 hours. Following treatment, cells were
either grown in drug-free media for an additional 3–4 days
to form colonies or re-seeded in 96-well plates at equal
density for each treatment condition and grown in drug
free media for six days prior to assessment of viability on
day 8. Colony formation was markedly reduced in all cell
lines treated with 1.0 µM AZD6738, particularly H23 and
H460, and in H23 treated with the 0.3 µM (Figure 1C).
Similarly, despite re-seeding, 0.3 and 1.0 µM AZD6738
treatment resulted in a dramatic decrease in viable
cell yield at day 8 in H23 (19.5% and 4.1% of control,
respectively, P ≤ 0.0001), while 1.0 µM AZD6738 reduced
yield of H460 and A549 cells to 24.0% and 65.9% of
control, respectively (P ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 1D). Treatment
with 0.3 µM AZD6738 resulted in a modest reduction in
viable cell yield in A549 (88.0% of control, P ≤ 0.0001),
but not H460.
Recent work has shown that inhibition of ATR
kinase, caused by an inactivating mutation in the ATR
activation domain (AAD) of TOPBP1, an allosteric
activator of ATR kinase activity, caused cellular
senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts [35]. Several
CDK inhibitors are key mediators of cellular senescence,
including p16, p21, and p27 [36–38]. In A549 and H460
cells, neither of which express p16 due to homozygous
deletion of CDKN2A [39, 40], we noted induction of p21
and p27 in response to AZD6738 treatment. In addition,
A549 cells did not exhibit increased PARP cleavage,
suggesting an alternative mechanism to apoptosis may
be responsible for phenotype observed in our long term
assays. We assessed senescence associated β-galactosidase
(SA-β-gal) activity 2–3 days after treatment with
AZD6738 (Figure 1E–1F and Supplementary Figure S1).
Consistent with a lack a p21 and p27 induction in H23
cells, we saw no evidence of increased senescence at
day 5 with AZD6738 treatment. Conversely, we noted
an approximately 19.7-fold increase in SA-β-gal positive
A549 cells (day 5) following treatment with 1.0 µM
AZD6738. While 0.3 µM AZD6738 increased SA-β-gal
activity by approximately 3.7-fold, the difference was
not statistically significant. We also observed an increase
in SA-β-gal activity in H460 cells (day 4). However,
similar to the colony formation experiments, there was a
dramatic decrease of overall cell number after treatment
with 1.0 µM AZD6738 (compared to control). This
dose resulted in ~50% inhibition in our 48  hour doseresponse studies, as well as PARP cleavage by 24 hours.
Taken together, these data suggest that senescence is
a contributing mechanism, but not the predominant
mechanism, responsible the impairment of H460 growth
and viability.

Recent studies have demonstrated combinatorial
activity of ATR kinase inhibitors with DNA damaging
agents in both in vitro and in vivo solid tumor models,
including NSCLC [33, 41]. To screen for potential
synergistic dose combinations of AZD6738 with the
standard-of-care chemotherapeutic agents cisplatin,
gemcitabine, and docetaxel, we treated H23, H460, A549,
and H358 cell lines in a 2-dimensional dosing matrix and
determined the excess inhibition over Loewe additivity for
each dose combination in the matrix [42]. Loewe excess
matrices indicated combinatorial activity of AZD6738
with cisplatin and gemcitabine, but not docetaxel, in all
cell lines (Supplementary Figure S2).
To validate combinatorial activity of AZD6738
with cisplatin and gemcitabine, we selected dose
combinations concentrated in areas of excess inhibition
in the Loewe excess matrices. We assessed ATP levels as
a surrogate for cell viability by CellTiter-Glo following
48 hour treatment with the selected doses. The selected
combinations of AZD6738 and cisplatin resulted in
additive to synergistic inhibition of viability in all cell
lines (Figure 2A–2B). Striking synergy was observed in
the ATM-deficient H23 cells, with doses of 0.19, 0.56,
and 1.67 µM AZD6738 and 1.67 and 5.0 µM cisplatin.
Synergy was also observed in H358, and to a lesser
degree, A549 cells, but at higher doses of both AZD6738
(0.56, 1.67 and 5.0 µM) and cisplatin (5.0 and 15.0 µM).
In addition, the overall effects on cell viability were much
less than observed in H23 cells (Figure  2B). As H460
cells exhibited higher sensitivity to both agents alone,
lower dose ranges for each agent (0.19–1.67 µM) were
employed. The selected combinations yielded additivity
to moderate synergy. We also observed synergy with
select dose combinations of AZD6738 and gemcitabine
in all four cell lines (Supplementary Figure S3). However,
the degree of synergy and effect on cell viability was less
pronounced in H23 compared to the synergy observed
with cisplatin.
Next we sought to determine to what degree
AZD6738 shifts sensitivity to cisplatin in H23, H460,
and A549 cells. We treated cells for 48  hours with a
fixed 0.3 or 1.0 µM dose of AZD6738 and a dose range
of cisplatin (0.19–15.0 µM) and assessed viability by
CellTiter-Glo. We observed dramatic shifts in cisplatin
sensitivity in H23 cells compared to H460 and A549 cells
(Figure 2C). Treatment with 1.0 µM AZD6738 resulted in
a 19.41-fold decrease in cisplatin IC50 in H23 cells versus
5.44- and 2.99-fold in H460 and A549 cells, respectively
(Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, 0.3 µM AZD6738
caused a 7.00-fold shift in H23, compared to 3.29- and
1.66-fold in H460 and A549, respectively.

The combination of AZD6738 and cisplatin
promotes accumulation of cells at the G1/S
border and in early S-phase

19.3% (P ≤ 0.01), respectively, in H460 cells by 4 hours
(Supplementary Figure  S4A). The trend persisted in
H460 cells at 8  hours, however the difference between
mock control and combination treatment was no longer
significant. We also observed no significant differences
in the overall percentage of cells that incorporated EdU
at either time point in either cell line (Supplementary
Figure S4B).

To determine whether the combination of AZD6738
and cisplatin resulted in cell cycle perturbations in H23
and H460 cells, we assessed cell cycle profiles at 8, 16, and
24 hours after treatment with 1.0 µM AZD6738, 5.0 µM
(H23) or 1.67  µM (H460) cisplatin, combination, or
mock (Figure 3A). In H23 cells, by 16 hours combination
treatment resulted in accumulation of cells at the G1/S
border (32.9% vs. 18.8% cells in S-phase, P ≤  0.01,
compared to mock), and loss of cells in G2/M (18.2%
vs. 36.8%, P ≤ 0.05, compared to mock) (Figure 3B). By
24 hours, cells treated with the combination exhibited
further reduction in the G2/M population (12.1% vs.
31.1%, P ≤ 0.001, compared to mock), persistence at the
G1/S border (35.2% vs. 25.7% cells in S-phase, P ≤ 0.001,
compared to mock), and an increase in the sub-G1
population. H23 cells treated with cisplatin alone now
also exhibited accumulation in early S-phase (39.1% vs.
25.7%, P ≤ 0.0001, compared to mock).
Conversely, H460 cells treated with the combination
of AZD6738 and cisplatin exhibited early S-phase
accumulation (37.3% vs. 27.5%, P ≤  0.01) and loss of
cells in G2/M (9.8% vs. 18.7%, P ≤ 0.0001) by 8 hours,
compared to mock control (Figure  3B). Combination
treatment resulted in loss of cells in G1 (28.9% vs. 44.3%,
P ≤ 0.01, compared to mock) and accumulation in S-phase
(41.5% vs. 28.8%, P ≤  0.01, compared to mock), in
conjunction with the emergence of a sub-G1 population
by 16  hours. AZD6738 treatment alone triggered G1
accumulation (62.3% vs. 44.3%, P ≤  0.001, compared
to mock), loss of cells from S-phase (17.7% vs. 28.8%,
P ≤ 0.01, compared to mock), and emergence of a sub-G1
population by 16  hours. Conversely, cells treated with
cisplatin alone began accumulating in late S-phase (43.7%
vs. 28.8%, P ≤ 0.001, compared to mock). While cisplatin
treatment resulted in clear G2/M arrest by 24  hours,
combining AZD6738 with cisplatin abrogated this G2/M
arrest (P  ≤  0.0001, compared to cisplatin alone), and
resulted in an overall loss of cycling cells and persistence
of a sub-G1 population.
To better determine the effects of AZD6738, with
and without cisplatin, on S-phase progression, we pulsed
H23 and H460 cells with 10 µM EdU prior to treatment as
described above for 4 or 8 hours. Compared to mock and
cisplatin treatment, AZD6738 and combination treatment
caused accumulation of cells at the entry into S-phase
in both cells lines, as evident by the population of cells
that have incorporated EdU but have not increased DNA
content beyond that of G1 cells (Figure 3C). Treatment
with AZD6738 and combination resulted in an increase
from 3.7% (mock control) to 12.3% (P  ≤  0.001) and
9.8% (P ≤ 0.01), respectively, in H23 cells by 8 hours,
and from 8.5% (mock control) to 19.8% (P ≤ 0.01) and

The combination of AZD6738 and cisplatin
induces rapid cell death in ATM-deficient
NSCLC cells
The presence of a sub-G1 population is indicative
of DNA degradation during cell death via apoptosis [43].
We quantified the percentage of cells in sub-G1 from our
16 and 24 hour cell cycle experiments, as well as assessed
sub-G1 content after 48 hour treatment (Figure 4A). The
combination of AZD6738 and cisplatin caused a significant
increase in cell death by 24 hours in both H23 (14.8% vs.
4.3% for mock, P ≤ 0.01) and H460 (19.1% vs. 3.8% for
mock, P ≤ 0.05, compared to mock) cells. By 48 hours,
the percentage of cells in sub-G1 further increased in both
H23 (24.8% vs. 4.8% for mock, P ≤ 0.0001) and H460
(39.1% vs. 3.7% for mock, P ≤ 0.01). Cisplatin alone also
induced significant cell death by this time point (17.5%,
P ≤ 0.0001 for H23; 26.8%, P ≤ 0.001 for H460).
Our sub-G1 data indicated greater cell death in
H460 cells. To better understand if this was driven by a
DNA damage response induced apoptosis, we examined
signaling through the ATM-p53 pathway, as well as
examined caspase-3 and PARP cleavage, in both cell lines
(Figure  4B-C). In both H23 and H460 cells, AZD6738
abrogated cisplatin-induced Chk1 phosphorylation. In
H460 cells, treatment with AZD6738, cisplatin, and
combination all resulted in activation of ATM (S1981),
stabilization of p53, and induction of p21 (Figure  4B).
Combination treatment caused the greatest effects on
this pathway, as well as a marked increase in H2A.X
phosphorylation (S139) not observed with AZD6738 or
cisplatin alone. ATM-deficient H23 cells also exhibited
a similar increase in phospho-H2A.X independent of the
ATM-p53 pathway. To further validate ATM deficiency
in H23 cells, we examined Chk2 phosphorylation (T68).
While cisplatin treatment induced Chk2 phosphorylation,
this was abrogated by AZD6738 in H23 cells but not H460
cells, indicating ATR dependent activation of Chk2 in the
absence of active ATM (Supplementary Figure  S5A).
Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage increased dramatically in
both cell lines following treatment with the combination
of AZD6738 and cisplatin (Figure 4C). In agreement with
the sub-G1 data, this suggested induction of apoptosis
following treatment with the combination.
In contrast to the sub-G1 data, our cell viability
studies indicated a more dramatic decrease in viability
following treatment with AZD6738 and cisplatin in

The combination of AZD6738 and cisplatin has
efficacy in NSCLC xenograft models and causes
rapid regression of ATM-deficient NSCLC
tumors

ATM-deficient H23 cells compared to H460 cells. We
hypothesized that in addition to apoptosis, H23 cells
may undergo non-apoptotic cell death. To determine
overall cell death following treatment of these cell
lines with AZD6738, cisplatin, or combination, we
performed DNA dye (SYTOX AADvanced) exclusion
assays at 4, 8, 16, 24, and 48  hours. We observed no
significant increases in cell death in either cell line at 4
or 8  hours (Supplementary Figure  S5B). In H23 cells
treated with the combination, we noted a dramatic
increase in cell death at 24  hours (30.2% vs. 9.2%,
P ≤ 0.0001) and 48 hours (70.4% vs. 11.0%, P ≤ 0.0001)
compared to mock control cells (Figure  4D–4E).
This extent of cell death was substantially greater than
observed in our sub-G1 analyses. Conversely, increases in
cell death in H460 cells treated with the combination were
similar to those observed in our sub-G1 analyses, with
21.9% death (vs. 7.2% in mock, P ≤ 0.0001) at 24 hours
and 43.0% (vs. 7.0% in mock, P ≤ 0.0001) at 48 hours
(Figure 4D–4E).

Next we assessed the efficacy of AZD6738 alone
and in combination with cisplatin in vivo. Effects on
food consumption and body weight are dose limiting
for AZD6738 in mice, rats and dogs, and are typically
accompanied by atrophic/degenerative histopathology
in the gastrointestinal tract after repeated dosing
(AstraZeneca, personal communication). AZD6738
caused hypocellularity in multiple lymphoid tissues and
bone marrow toxicity correlated with a decrease in all
cell lineages in the peripheral blood. There was a minimal
increase in alveolar macrophages. Recovery of these
effects was seen after cessation of dosing.
We treated nude mice bearing H460 tumors with
50 mg/kg AZD6738 (PO) and mice bearing ATM- deficient
H23 tumors with 25  mg/kg AZD6738 (PO) and for
14 consecutive days. Mice received 3 mg/kg cisplatin
(IP) on days 1 and 8 of the two week treatment cycle.
Body weight loss was the dose limiting toxicity with
daily administration of 50  mg/kg AZD6738, alone and
in combination with cisplatin. However, body weights
remained within protocol guidelines for the duration
of treatment, and no animal on study lost greater than
14.3% BW at any point during treatment (Figure  6A).
Conversely, 25 mg/kg AZD6738 was well tolerated, with
mean body weight (BW) losses of less than 2.7% and 4.8%
in the single agent and combination arms, respectively
(Figure 6B). Mice treated with the combination exhibited
BW loss similar to those that received cisplatin alone.
The combination of 50  mg/kg AZD6738 and
cisplatin resulted in a 75.5% mean tumor growth inhibition
(TGI) of H460 xenografts at day 14 (P ≤ 0.0001 compared
to vehicle) (Figure 6C). Growth of tumors treated with
the combination was also significantly different from
that of tumors treated with cisplatin or AZD6738 alone
(P  ≤  0.01 or P ≤  0.05, respectively). Growth delay for
the combination treatment was 12 days (day 26 vs. day
14), although only one of seven tumors had reached the
2000 mm3 endpoint on day 26. While modest growth
inhibition was observed in the single agent AZD6738 and
cisplatin treatment arms, the differences in growth were
not statistically significant (P ≥ 0.05).
Strikingly, the combination of 25 mg/kg AZD6738
and cisplatin resulted in rapid and near complete tumor
regression (84.8%) of ATM-deficient H23 tumors by day
29 (Figure 6D). The mean change in tumor growth was
significantly different than that of the mock, cisplatin,
and AZD6738 treatment arms (P  ≤  0.001, P ≤  0.01,

Knockdown of ATM sensitizes NSCLC cells to
the combination of AZD6738 and cisplatin
in vitro
To determine the role for ATM deficiency in
sensitivity of NSCLC cells to the combination of AZD6738
and cisplatin, we knocked down ATM protein in H460 and
A549 cells using a short hairpin RNA construct (shATM)
(Figure 5A). We then performed curve shift analysis by
treating shATM and scrambled control cell lines with a
fixed 0.3 or 1.0 µM dose of AZD6738 in combination with
cisplatin (0.19–15.0 µM) and assessing cell viability after
48 hour treatment. Intriguingly, we noted that the shATM
cell lines exhibited decreased sensitivity to AZD6738
alone (Figure 5B) as well as cisplatin alone in this assay
(Figure 5C and Table 1). Despite this, knockdown of ATM
sensitized both H460 and A549 cells to the combination of
AZD6738 and cisplatin (Figure 5C and Table 1). In H460
shATM cells, 1.0 µM AZD6738 shifted cisplatin IC50 from
2.77 µM to 0.22 µM (12.59-fold), compared to 2.36 µM
to 0.43 µM (5.44-fold) and 1.83 uM to 0.84 (2.18-fold) in
wildtype and scrambled control cells, respectively. Similar
results were seen in A549 shATM cells. Treatment with
1.0 µM AZD6738 reduced cisplatin IC50 from 19.84 µM to
1.02 µM (19.45-fold) versus reductions from 7.79 µM to
2.61 µM (2.98-fold) and 9.68 µM to 3.48 µM (2.78- fold)
in wildtype and scrambled control cells, respectively.
Treatment with 0.3 µM AZD6738 also resulted in greater
shifts in cisplatin IC50 and lower net IC50 values in shATM
cell lines compared to wildtype and scrambled control
lines (Table 1).

DISCUSSION

and P ≤ 0.05, respectively). Treatment with cisplatin or
AZD6738 alone did not result in significant inhibition
of tumor growth (P > 0.05). After day 29, mice in the
combination treatment arm were observed weekly for
tumor regrowth. Of the six mice that received combination
treatment, three exhibited complete tumor resolution by
days 43, 64, and 92, respectively. There was no visual or
palpable evidence of tumor out to a final observation on
day 113. In the remaining three mice, tumors began to
slowly regrow within 3–5 weeks of the end of treatment.
We confirmed by immunohistochemistry that
25  mg/kg AZD6738 inhibits ATR activity in H23
xenografts. Mice were treated with 25 mg/kg AZD6738
daily for 8 consecutive days, 3 mg/kg cisplatin on days
1 and 8, combination, or vehicle, and tumors were
harvested six hours following the final dose on day 8.
Tumors from mice treated with AZD6738 exhibited
reduced phosphorylation of T1989 (Supplementary
Figure S6), a marker of active ATR [44, 45].

AZD6738 is a highly selective and potent inhibitor
of ATR kinase activity that is both orally active and
bioavailable. As previously described for ETP-46464,
and the selective ATR kinase inhibitors VE-821 and VX970 (VE-822) [21–26, 32, 33], AZD6738 induces ATM
kinase-dependent DNA damage signaling and potentiates
cell killing by cisplatin.
To our knowledge, this is the first documentation
that ATR kinase inhibition can induce senescence in cancer
cells. This was anticipated from the finding that inhibition
of ATR kinase induced by an inactivating mutation
in the ATR activation domain (AAD) of TOPBP1, an
allosteric activator of ATR kinase activity, caused cellular
senescence in mouse embryonic fibroblasts [35]. Since
ATR signaling can also drive cells into senescence in
the absence of DNA breaks [46], ATR kinase signaling
appears to be a key mediator of senescence. AZD6738

induced senescence in Kras mutant, p53-wildtype
A549 and H460 cells, consistent with activation of the
ATM-p53-p21 signaling pathway as well as induction of
p27. However, AZD6738 did not induce senescence in
Kras mutant H23 cells which lack a functional ATM-p53
axis. The senescence rather than apoptosis of A549 cells
observed following AZD6738 treatment is consistent with a
prior report that A549 cells possess an “apoptosis-reluctant”
phenotype [47]. Conversely, AZD6738 treatment elicited an
apoptotic response H460 cells, in addition to senescence,
and our data suggests that cell death predominates
over senescence in this cell line. Given that H460 cells
overexpress c-myc, our observations are consistent with the
finding that ATR is required to limit apoptosis associated
with Myc-induced replication stress [48].
AZD6738 potentiates the cytotoxicity of cisplatin
and gemcitabine in the four NSCLC cell lines we tested.
Notably, AZD6738 strongly synergizes with cisplatin in
an ATM-deficient NSCLC cell line, as has been reported
with other ATR kinase inhibitors and other cancer cells
previously [23].  In both ATM-deficient H23 cells and
ATM-wildtype H460 cells, AZD6738 causes cell cycle
aberrations, with cells accumulating at the G1/S border
and in early S-phase. Both cell lines exhibit an apoptotic
response following treatment with the combination of
AZD6738 and cisplatin, evident by caspase-3 and PARP
cleavage. However, while H460 cells with activated ATM
signaling appear to undergo apoptosis, ATM- deficient
H23 cells exhibit considerably greater cell death in dye
exclusion studies than observed in sub-G1 analyses,
suggesting that an alternative mode of cell death
predominates in this context.
In addition to the synergy of AZD6738 with cisplatin
observed in ATM-deficient H23 cells, shRNA knockdown
of ATM resulted in similar synergy with cisplatin in vitro
in two p53-wildtype NSCLC cell lines. ATM mutations
are found in lymphoid tumors [49–51], pancreatic cancers
[52], as well as 7% of lung adenocarcinomas [53]. These
data have important clinical implications as they suggest
that AZD6738 has the potential to enhance the efficacyof-standard of care treatments in >  150,000 NSCLC
patients in the USA each year, particularly those harboring
ATM-deficient tumors.
ATR is an essential protein in mice and mammalian
cells [15–18], and there is a pervasive view that ATR
kinase inhibitors will not be tolerated in the clinic. Here,
while body weight loss was dose limiting with daily
administration of 50  mg/kg AZD6738 by oral gavage
for 14 consecutive days, treatment with 25 mg/kg
AZD6738 daily for 14 consecutive days was tolerated
in mice, as food consumption and body weight were
relatively unchanged. This dose of AZD6738 was
shown to inhibit ATR in mice and the expected plasma
half-life of AZD6738 in mice is approximately 6 hours
(Astra Zeneca, personal communication). We show that
treatment with 25  mg/kg AZD6738 daily for 8 days,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

inhibits ATR activity in H23 xenografts, evident by
reduced immunohistochemical staining for phosphoATR T1989. Furthermore, AZD6738 clearly has activity
at this dose as the H23 xenografts strongly responded
to the combination of AZD6738 and cisplatin, but
showed no response to cisplatin alone. In other studies,
AZD6738  has been successfully administered to mice
at 25  mg/kg PO twice daily (13 days) and at 75  mg/
kg PO once daily for 21 days (AstraZeneca, personal
communication).
ATR kinase signaling is frequently high in cancer
cells and this is thought to be associated with replication
stress, making ATR an intriguing target [54–56]. Inhibition
of ATR with AZD6738 enhances the efficacy of the
first-line therapeutic agent cisplatin both in vitro and
in vivo, and the standard-of-care agent gemcitabine in
vitro. AZD6738 is orally active and bioavailable and is
well tolerated in mice. Importantly, AZD6738 strongly
synergizes with cisplatin in ATM-deficient models of
NSCLC, and causes near complete tumor regression in an
ATM-deficient xenograft model. Taken together, these data
support the potential clinical utility of AZD6738 for the
treatment of NSCLC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell lines
NCI-H23, NCI-H460, A549, NCI-H358, and
IMR-90 were purchased from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC) in November, 2013. Cells
were periodically tested for mycoplasma (Lonza
MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit). Experiments
were conducted on cells with fewer than 20 passages
after initial resuscitation. Cells were cultured in
RPMI-1640 (containing 2 mM l-glutamine) supplemented
with 10% FBS, penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified
incubator at 37ºC with 5% CO2. Cells were seeded
approximately 20–22 h prior to treatment with AZD6738
or chemotherapeutics.

Drugs and reagents
AZD6738 was provided by AstraZeneca. For
in vitro use, AZD6738 was dissolved in DMSO at 30 mM
and diluted in DMSO to desired working concentrations.
The final DMSO concentration in media for all conditions
and controls was 0.1% for AZD6738 dose response
experiments, 0.05% for AZD6738 +  chemotherapy
viability experiments, and 0.025% for all experiments
involving 0.3 µM and 1.0 µM doses of AZD6738. For
in vivo use, AZD6738 was dissolved in DMSO at a
concentration of 25 mg/mL or 50 mg/mL and diluted 1:5
in propylene glycol. An equal volume of H2O was added
to yield 2.5 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL AZD6738 in 10% DMSO,
40% propylene glycol, and 50% sterile dH2O. Cisplatin

for corresponding total protein. Images of blots were
acquired at 24-bit depth using a Canon LiDE110 scanner
and were processed (converted to 8-bit, cropped) using
ImageJ.

Crystal violet colony formation and senescence
assays
Cells were treated (in triplicate) in 12-well plates
with 0.3 µM, 1 µM AZD6738, or mock for 48  h.
Following treatment, AZD6738 was removed, and cells
were cultured an additional 2–4 days in fresh media.
Colony formation was visualized by staining with 0.5%
crystal violet in 95% EtOH. Images were captured with
an Olympus SZX10 stereo microscope and DP26 camera.
Unprocessed images were resized for inclusion in figures.
Experiments were repeated at least three times to ensure
consistent results. Senescence-associated β-galactosidase
activity was assessed using the Biovision Senescence
Detection Kit. Images were acquired using a Leica
DMI3000B inverted microscope (20X objective) and
DFC420C camera. Unprocessed images were resized for
inclusion in figures.

Cell viability assays
Cells were treated in white walled, clear bottom
96-well plates with the indicated doses of AZD6738,
cisplatin, gemcitabine, or combination for 48 h. ATP
levels were assessed as surrogate measure of viability
was assessed using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell
Viability Assay (Promega) and Safire2 plate reader (Tecan).
Raw data were corrected for background luminescence
prior to further analysis. For AZD6738 treatment, log
dose response curves were generated in GraphPad Prism
6 by nonlinear regression (log(inhibitor) vs. response
with variable slope) of log-transformed (x = log(x)) data
normalized to the mean of untreated controls. GI50 values,
defined as the dose X at which Y = 50%, were extrapolated
from dose response curves. For combination treatments,
data were normalized to the mean of untreated controls.
Loewe excess matrices were generated using Chalice
Analyzer Online (Horizon CombinatoRx) and mean
normalized inhibition values. For AZD6738 + cisplatin
curve shift experiments, data were normalized to the mean
of 0 µM cisplatin controls within each AZD6738 treatment
condition. Log dose response curves were generated in
GraphPad Prism 6 by nonlinear regression (log(inhibitor)
vs. normalized response with variable slope) of logtransformed (x = log(x)), normalized data. IC50 values
were calculated by Prism 6.

Replating assays for long term cell viability
Cells were treated with 0.3 µM, 1 µM AZD6738, or
mock for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were seeded in
96 well plates (4 replicates) at equal density per condition
and grown for an additional 6 days. Viability was
assessed on day 8 using the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent
Cell Viability Assay (Promega) and Safire2 plate reader
(Tecan). Background corrected data were normalized to
the mean of untreated controls.

Flow cytometry
Cells were treated with AZD6738, cisplatin,
combination, or mock for the indicated times and collected
following trypsinization. For cell cycle and cell death
(DNA dye exclusion) experiments, the existing media
and 1x PBS wash were retained and added to collected
cells. Data collection and analyses were performed using
an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Samples
were gated on SSC-A vs. FSC-A followed by SSC-H vs.
SSC-A for removal of doublets. Approximately 10,000
gated events were collected. For cell cycle analysis,
collected samples were washed with 1% FBS/1x PBS
and fixed in 70% EtOH at 4°C for at least 24  h. Cells
were then washed with 1% FBS/1x PBS, incubated for
5 min at room temperature in phospho-citrate buffer
(0.064 M sodium phosphate, 0.001 M citric acid, in 1%
FBS/1x PBS), and stained with propidium iodide solution
(0.05 mg/mL propidium iodide, 0.1 mg/mL RNase A, in
1% FBS/1x PBS) for 15 min at 37°C. Additional gating
on FL2-H vs. FL2-A was used to ensure removal of

Immunoblotting
Cells were treated with the indicated doses of
AZD6738, cisplatin, combination, or mock for 24  h.
Protein lysates were generated by scraping adherent cells
in lysis buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCL, 5 mM
NaF, 1% Tween 20, 0.5% IGEPAL CA-630, protease
inhibitor cocktail, pH 7.5) and incubating on ice for 30
min. For AZD6738  +  cisplatin experiments, detached
cells were pelleted from the media and combined with
the adherent cell lysate. SDS-PAGE using 4–12%
Bis-Tris gels (NuPAGE Novex) and Western blotting
were performed using standard techniques. Antibody
details are provided in the supplementary methods.

Mouse xenograft experiments
Protocols for animal experiments were approved
by the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care and Use
Committee and were strictly followed. Female athymic
nude (Foxn1nu) mice, 6–7 weeks old, were purchased
from Harlan Laboratories. H23 (3 × 106 cells) or H460
(7 × 105 cells) were injected subcutaneously into the
right hind flank in a volume of 100 µL (equal parts 1x
PBS and Matrigel). Cells were tested for mycoplasma
(Lonza MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection Kit) prior
to inoculation in mice. Mice began receiving treatment
once tumors reached approximately 220 mm3 (± 15%) for
H23 or 180 mm3 (± 15%) for H460. Tumor volume was
calculated as (L × W2)/2. AZD6738 was administered by
oral gavage (qd × 14) at 25  mg/kg (H23) or 50  mg/kg
(H460). Cisplatin was administered intraperitoneally
(q7d × 2) at 3 mg/kg. The dosing volume was 10 mL/kg.
Growth curves depict mean (± SEM) tumor volume over
time. Mean tumor growth inhibition was calculated as
