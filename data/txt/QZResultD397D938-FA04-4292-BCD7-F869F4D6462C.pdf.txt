ABSTRACT
Despite the advent of several new treatment options over the past years,
advanced/metastatic prostate carcinoma (PCa) still remains incurable, which justifies
the search for novel targets and therapeutic molecules. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is a
shuttling nucleoprotein involved in tumor growth and its targeting could be a potential
approach for cancer therapy. We previously demonstrated that the multivalent
pseudopeptide N6L binds to NPM1 potently affecting in vitro and in vivo tumor cell
growth of various tumor types as well as angiogenesis. Furthermore, NPM1 binds to
androgen receptor (AR) and modulate its activity. In this study, we first investigated
the implication of the NPM1 and its Thr199 and Thr234/237 phosphorylated forms in
PCa. We showed that phosphorylated forms of NPM1 interact with androgen receptor
(AR) in nucleoplasm. N6L treatment of prostate tumor cells led to inhibition of NPM1
phosphorylation in conjunction with inhibition of AR activity. We also found that
total and phosphorylated NPM1 were overexpressed in castration-resistant PCa.
Assessment of the potential therapeutic role of N6L in PCa indicated that N6L inhibited
tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo when used either alone or in combination
with the standard-of-care first- (hormonotherapy) and second-line (docetaxel)
treatments for advanced PCa. Our findings reveal the role of Thr199 and Thr234/237
phosphorylated NPM1 in PCa progression and define N6L as a new drug candidate
for PCa therapy.

as the source of PCa growth, the main treatment for
metastatic PCa patients remains androgen withdrawal.
Unfortunately, after an initial high clinical rate, tumors
recur leading to a castration-resistant prostate cancer
(CRPC) state. First line treatment is either a docetaxelbased chemotherapy that confers a modest survival

improvement with less than six months’ duration [2–4] or
second line hormonal therapy with abiraterone acetate or
enzalutamide due to persistent tissue levels of androgens
and recurrent activity of androgen receptor (AR) [5–9].
Over the past years, several other new therapeutic agents
including cabazitaxel, Sipuleucel-T and radium-223 have
been also shown to confer a survival benefit to CRPC and
chemoresistant patients [10] [11] [12]. Nevertheless, all
these treatments remain palliative and research efforts are
still needed to provide new therapeutic solutions.
Nucleophosmin (NPM1/B23/NO38/numatrin) is
a multifunctional protein involved in several cellular
processes including ribosome biogenesis [13], centrosome
duplication [14], molecular chaperone activities [15] and
nucleocytoplasmic protein trafficking [16]. NPM1 also
plays important roles in cancer since it is over-expressed
in proliferating cells compared to normal cells [17, 18] and
has been proposed to be a marker of different solid tumors
such as prostate [19], colon [20], ovarian [21], gastric [22],
bladder [23], hepatomic [24], oral [25] and thyroid [26,
27] carcinomas. NPM1 can be phosphorylated by different
kinases modifying its localization and functions (reviewed
in [28]). Indeed, phosphorylation by CDK2/cyclin E on
Thr199 residue during G1 phase is critical for the NPM1
dissociation from the centrosome to initiate its duplication
and the pre-mRNA processing [29]. NPM1 is also
phosphorylated on threonine residues (Thr199, Thr219
and Thr234/237) during mitosis allowing its dissociation
from the nucleolus [30].
We previously demonstrated that the multivalent
pseudopeptide N6L binds to two major nucleoproteins,
nucleolin and NPM1, and inhibited tumor growth and
associated angiogenesis [31]. Recently, it has been
demonstrated that NPM1 could bind to AR thereby
modulating its activity [32]. In the present study, we
explored in which cell compartment the AR/NPM1
interaction could occur and we evaluated the effect of
N6L on NPM1 phosphorylation and AR activity. We then
studied the expression levels of total NPM1 and two of
its phosphorylated forms, Thr199 and Thr234/237, in
different stages of human PCa. Finally, we evaluated
the effect of N6L on prostate tumor growth, in vitro and
in vivo, alone or in combination with either hormonal
therapies or docetaxel treatments.

examined the localization of these two proteins in two
dihydrotestosterone (DHT) responsive cell lines, LNCaP
and VCaP. NPM1 was mainly localized in nucleolus and
AR was mainly localized in nucleoplasm of both cell lines
showing no colocalization (Figure 1A). Nevertheless,
some spots of coincidental staining were observed in
the nucleoplasm of LNCaP cells, while expectedly, such
spots were absent in VCaP cells as NPM1 is expressed at
marginal level in the nucleoplasm. Nucleoplasmic NPM1
displays the particularity to be phosphorylated [33], we
next asked if the two phosphorylated forms of NPM1,
Thr199 and Thr234/237, could colocalize with AR. In
interphasic LNCaP and VCaP, the two phosphorylated
forms were absent of the nucleoli and localized in subnuclear structures, named nuclear speckles, that appeared
dense in bright field pictures and were stained with the antisc-35 antibody (Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure 1C).
Furthermore, as already described [34], high expression of
Thr199 and Thr234/237 NPM1 was noted during mitosis
in LNCaP and VCaP cells with an increase in expression
until metaphase followed by a decrease from anaphase
to interphase (Supplementary Figure 2). Interestingly,
AR was also observed in these sub-nuclear structures
in LNCaP and VCaP cells. The two-labeled spots from
AR and phosphorylated NPM1 appeared juxtaposed and
partially fused suggesting a probable contact between
the two proteins in these nucleoplasm structures (Figure
1B). In addition, NPM1 and its two phosphorylated forms
co-immunoprecipitate with AR arguing for the idea of
an interaction between these two proteins (Figure 1C).
These results suggest a role for the phosphorylated status
of NPM1 in AR signaling and a potential role in PCa
development.

N6L treatment interferes with NPM1
phosphorylation and AR activity
N6L is an inhibitor of tumor growth and
angiogenesis and one of its molecular targets is NPM1
[31]. As NPM1 phosphorylation seems to be involved in
PCa development, we set out to investigate N6L effect
on the expression of total and phosphorylated NPM1
using Western blotting experiments on LNCaP cells.
Total NPM1 expression did not appear to change upon
N6L treatment neither with time of treatment nor with
the concentration used whereas a substantial decrease in
NPM1 phosphorylation was observed with 20 μmol/L N6L
(63% for Thr199 and 86% for Thr234/237 of reduction at
48 hours) (Figure 2A and 2B). Comparable results were
observed in VCaP cells (Figure 2A). Immunofluorescent
analysis showed that the reduction of NPM1
phosphorylation by N6L was due to a global decrease
in phosphorylated NPM1 in interphasic cells associated
with a decrease in the number of strongly stained mitotic
cells as observed at a lower magnification (Figure 2C–2E).
These results suggest that N6L effectively impedes NPM1
phosphorylation.

RESULTS
Phosphorylated Thr199 and Thr234/237 forms
of NPM1 and AR were both localized in subnuclear structures
It has been demonstrated that NPM1 interacts
with AR and modulates its activity [32] but in which
cellular compartment the AR/NPM1 interaction may
occur has yet to be determined. To answer this question,
we performed immunofluorescence analyses and

analysis of Western blots (Figure 3A and 3B). By contrast,
after 48 hours of treatment, N6L induced a significant
decrease in PSA expression in a dose- and time-dependent
manner with reduction about 38% at 5 μmol/L and 48%
at 20 μmol/L (Figure 3A and 3B). This downregulation
of PSA was confirmed at the RNA level by qRT-PCR in
LNCaP cells (Figure 3C). Altogether, these results suggest
that N6L inhibits NPM1 phosphorylations on Thr 199 and
Thr 234/237 and AR activity.

independent, DU145, 22RV1 and PC3. All cell lines were
found to be sensitive to N6L after 72 hours of treatment
as assessed using MTT assays (Figure 4A and 4B). The
calculated GI50 were LNCaP: 5.1 ± 1 μmol/L, VCaP: 22.3
± 6 μmol/L, DU145: 6.1 ± 1.9 μmol/L, 22RV1: 11.1 ± 4.4
μmol/L and PC3: 10.2 ± 2.9 μmol/L. Since three of the
cell lines are androgen-independent, these results suggest
that impairment of NPM1 phosphorylation by N6L do
not interfere only with AR signaling and demonstrate
that N6L use for advanced PCa treatment merits to be
considered.
In clinical practice, advanced PCa are treated with
hormonotherapy. In an attempt to mimic and evaluate
hormonotherapy in combination with N6L, LNCaP and
VCaP cells were first treated for 24 hours with N6L
and then cultured in complete medium or in androgendeprived medium (cs-FBS). As previously described,
when LNCaP cells were switched to culture media
containing cs-FBS, cell growth was reduced [35], herein
about 43% after 48 hours of androgen deprivation (AD).

N6L inhibited prostate tumor growth in vitro
and in vivo and displayed additive effect with
castration
The inhibition of NPM1 phosphorylation by N6L
leading to a decrease in AR activity highlights its potential
for clinical use in PCa. In this context, we evaluated the
in vitro inhibitory activity of N6L on prostate tumor cell
growth using two cell lines considered as androgendependent, LNCaP and VCaP, and three as androgen-

Simultaneous exposure of cells to N6L and AD showed
additive effect (Figure 4C). This was highlighted by
the “N6L + AD normalized” curve in which the 100%
of cell viability corresponds to cells only treated with
AD and where the decrease in cell growth was similar
to the one without AD. These results were confirmed
using the VCaP cell line (Supplementary Figure 3).
According to these in vitro results, we next analyzed the
combinatory effect on tumor growth in vivo using VCaP
ectopic xenograft model which mimics clinical response
to castration [36]. Once the mean tumor volume
reached approximately 600 mm3, mice were castrated
by surgery in order to block androgen synthesis. As
already described [36], in response to castration, tumor
volume of control mice decreased for 2 weeks after
which tumor became castration-resistant and progressed

again independently of androgens as observed in the
clinical setting (Figure 4D). N6L treatment resulted
in a significant stabilization of tumor growth and an
additive effect with castration when this molecule was
administrated 1 week before or 1 day after castration.
In addition, our results also showed the ability of N6L
to block over a 28 days period the growth of castration
resistant tumor cells during the regrowth phase.
Immunohistological analyses of tumor demonstrated a
reduction in tumor angiogenesis (CD34), in proliferative
activity (KI-67) and an increase in apoptosis (tunnel) in
tumors treated with N6L compared with control tumors
(Figure 5). Taken together, these results indicate that
N6L inhibits the growth of several PCa cell lines, and
displays an additive effect with androgen deprivation in
vitro and in vivo.

NPM1 Thr234/237 where the expression was especially
high in the nucleus of basal cells. The three forms were

forms in all cellular compartments that may correspond to
mitotic cells (Figure 6A). These data suggest that NPM1
and its two phosphorylated forms could be important in
the progression to CRPC state and represent promising
targets for advanced PCa treatment.

NPM1 is a multifunctional protein overexpressed
in proliferating cells such as tumor cells and has been
proposed as a marker of different solid tumors [20–27]. In
this study, we found NPM1 to be overexpressed in tumor
cells compared to adjacent normal tissue. In addition, we
have shown for the first time that two of its phosphorylated
forms, Thr199 and Thr234/237, were also overexpressed
in tumor cells compared to adjacent normal cells. Previous
studies reporting on NPM1 expression in hormone naïve
PCa have found either no significant differences [37]
or overexpression in tumor cells compared to adjacent
normal tissue [19, 32].
Markedly, in this survey, NPM1 and its two
phosphorylated forms were found to be significantly
upregulated in CRPC compared to ADPC. With regards
to prognostic issues, NPM1 has been associated with
tumor grading in hepatocellular and endometrial
carcinomas but not in oral squamous carcinoma [21,
22, 38]. In this survey, we did not see any association
of NPM1 forms with standard clinico-pathological
parameters including the pathological grade (as
assessed by Gleason score defining prognosis from
histopathological values) supporting the idea that NPM1
phosphorylation and overexpression may play a role
in castration-resistant phenotype of PCa but not in the
progression from low to high grades.
The link between AR signaling and NPM1 in
prostate was first demonstrated by an increase in NPM1
expression after androgen stimulation in rat ventral
prostatic nuclei [39]. Moreover, a decrease in NPM1
expression and in its phosphorylation was earlier described
during apoptosis of epithelial prostate cells in rat after
castration [40]. Recent studies have demonstrated that
NPM1 could bind to AR and enhanced its transcriptional
activity [32]. Since AR is expressed in nucleoplasm and
not in nucleolus, which is preferential localization of
NPM1, we examined if this interaction could occur in the
nucleoplasm where NPM1 is phosphorylated especially
at the Thr199 and 234/237 sites. This hypothesis was
supported by the fact that the domains involved in the AR/
NPM1 interaction are the binding DBD/Hinge of AR with
the Hetero D/NBD of NPM1 spanning the amino acids 190
to 292 including the two phosphorylating sites Thr199 and
Thr234/237 [32]. We found that phosphorylated NPM1
colocalized with AR in some spots in the nucleoplasm of
LNCaP and VCaP cells. Previous studies have reported
the localization of similar spots observed for the Thr199
phosphorylated form of NPM1 in mouse skin fibroblast
to be nuclear speckles, suggesting pre-mRNA processing
activity of NPM1 [33]. These data were confirmed by the
colocalization of the two phosphorylated form of NPM1
with the nuclear speckles marker SC35 (Supplementary
Figure 1). The role of AR in the nuclear speckles remains
unclear but it has previously been shown that AR activity
could be modulated in the nuclear speckles after binding
with the Ski-interacting protein [41]. The colocalization

N6L displayed an additive effect with docetaxel
chemotherapy in vitro and in vivo
Castrate resistant PCa patients are currently treated
by taxane based chemotherapy (docetaxel). We thus
investigated the combined effects of N6L and docetaxel on
tumor growth. For this purpose, we evaluated cell viability
evaluating by MTT assays (Figure 7A), using the LNCaP
cells which are sensitive to docetaxel and LNCaP-NE,
which are chemoresistant cells [35]. In accordance with
this previous study, LNCaP were sensitive to docetaxel
with a GI50 of 5 nmol/L whereas LNCaP-NE displayed a
resistance to docetaxel with a growth inhibition of 30%
at high concentration (100 nmol/L). In LNCaP cultures,
the N6L/docetaxel combination resulted in an additive
growth-inhibiting effect (Figure 7B). The combination
index (CI), obtained using the Chou-Talalay method,
was 1.08 ± 0.05 confirming the additive effect. These
results were also confirmed on two docetaxel sensitive
but androgen-independent cell lines, 22RV1 and DU145
(Supplementary Figure 4) with CI of 0.97 ± 0.28 and
0.92 ± 0.12 respectively. As expected, only the effect
of N6L was noted in LNCaP-NE cells (Figure 7C). To
confirm these results, the combination was then tested
in anchorage-independent conditions. Docetaxel (100
nmol/L) induced death of about 65% in LNCaP derived
colonies and 50 μmol/L N6L had only minor effects with
20% dead colonies (Figure 7D). The N6L/docetaxel
combination induced 95% of dead colonies, again showing
an additive effect of both treatments. With regards to
LNCaP-NE, cells were resistant to docetaxel. N6L
induced 57 % of colony death and comparable results were
obtained for the combination further indicating that only
N6L is potent against these cells (Figure 7E). Finally, the
combination was tested in vivo using the model of DU145
ectopic xenografts in nude mice. Since DU145 cells are
androgen–independent and sensitive to docetaxel and
N6L, we thought to use this model to evaluate the efficacy
of drugs that could be employed to treat patients in the
CRPC context. A superior effect was observed when using
the combination compared with either drug alone (Figure
7F). All together, these results strongly suggest that a
treatment of CRPC with N6L may potentially enhance
responses observed with docetaxel chemotherapy alone.

DISCUSSION
Since current therapies to treat CRPC patients
remain insufficient, further research is needed to find new
molecular targets and to develop new therapeutic agents.

of two phosphorylated forms of NPM1 with AR suggests
their potential role in the regulation of AR activity.
Treatment of LNCaP or VCaP cells with N6L
inhibited NPM1 phosphorylation without noticeable
change in total NPM1 expression. This inhibition was
due to a general decrease in expression as well as a
reduced number of strongly positive cells during mitosis.
Additional analysis of the LNCaP cell cycle by FACS
after BrdU and PI staining showed that N6L blocked
LNCaP cells in G2/M phase with a strong decrease in
the S phase (Supplementary Figure 5). These two results
suggest a blocking of the LNCaP cell cycle in the G2
phase which is in agreement with the role of Thr199
phosphorylated NPM1 for centrosome dissociation
during the initiation of cell duplication [14]. Decrease in
NPM1 phosphorylation was associated with an inhibition
of PSA expression reinforcing the hypothesis that the
Thr199 and Thr234/237 phosphorylated form of NPM1
could participate to AR activity. Our results highlight that
NPM1 and its phosphorylated forms were overexpressed
in CRPC and could participate to AR signaling, supporting
the hypothesis that NPM1 may play important roles
in resistance to castration and pinpoint the NPM1 as a
promising target for CRPC therapy.
Our in vitro and in vivo experimental studies
revealed N6L anti-tumoral activity in numerous androgendependent or -independent human PCa cell lines. All these
cell lines were sensitive to N6L with no correlation with
the androgen-dependent or -independent state of the cells
implying that the effect of N6L on human prostatic tumor
cells is not solely due to the inhibition of AR activity.
NPM1 is a protein involved in many cellular processes
including chaperon activity and ribosome biogenesis,
but also in apoptosis and cell cycle. It could block the
degradation of P53 and ARF acting as an anti-apoptotic
molecule [42] [43] or cell cycle where the inhibition of
its expression lead to cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase
[44]. Recently, it has been shown that NPM1 could
favor migration, invasion and colony forming of prostate
tumor cells [45]. NPM1 blockade and inhibition of
its phosphorylation could disrupt all these processes
independently of AR activity. Furthermore, N6L could
act through several mechanisms involving nucleolin and
sulfated glycosaminoglycans [46].
One notable aspect of our observations is the
potential of N6L in improving the therapeutic efficacy of
androgen deprivation and docetaxel in vitro and in vivo
showing in both cases additive effects. It is noteworthy
to mention that certain PCa cells have the capacity to
transdifferentiate to acquire a neuroendocrine (NE) like
phenotype which has been proposed as a mechanism for
chemo and castration resistances [35] Moreover, there
has been increasing concerns that with the introduction
of novel potent AR-targeted drugs into the clinic for
CRPC, the incidence of Neuroendocrine PC (NEPC) may
increase [47]. Here, we tested in vitro the efficiency of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

N6L on neuroendocrine-like tumor cells (LNCaP-NE) and
found that LNCaP-NE are remarkably sensitive to N6L.
This highlights potential effects and novel therapeutic
opportunities to prevent and treat NEPC development in
combination with anti-AR approaches. Moreover, it has
been shown that NE markers such as β-tubulin III and
epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition could be responsible
for docetaxel resistance [35] [48]. The effect of 48 hours
N6L treatment on LNCaP-NE cells on neuroendocrine
β-tubulin III and mesenchymal vimentin markers was
evaluated by Western blot. No effects were observed
which is consistent with an additive and not synergistic
effect of the N6L/docetaxel combination treatment (data
not shown).
In summary, the data presented herein bring to light
the potential implication of the phosphorylated forms of
NPM1 in AR signaling and progression towards CRPC
state, although its full biological functions independent of
AR remain to be elucidated. Using the NPM1 targeting
multivalent pseudopeptide N6L we demonstrated that
inhibition of NPM1 phosphorylation led to inhibition of
AR activity, although the exact mechanism by which N6L
inhibits NPM1 phosphorylation remains to be elucidated.
These results also highlight N6L as a promising
therapeutic for advanced PCa.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Human prostate tissue samples and
immunohistochemical analysis
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) prostate
tissues have been collected as part of an Institutional
Review Board-approved protocol at the Department of
Pathology at the Henri Mondor Hospital, Créteil, France.
Pathological specimens of hormone-naive PCa (n=48)
used in this study were obtained from patients treated
for localized disease by radical prostatectomy. Primary
CRPC specimens (n=20) were collected at the time of the
trans-urethral resection of the prostate in patients who
experienced disease recurrence after an initial response
to hormone therapy. Recurrence was defined as patients
having PSA progression despite a complete androgen
blockade therapy and a castrated level of testosterone.
FFPE tissues were sectioned at 5 μm thickness and
deparaffinized. Antigen were unmasked by heat retrieval
with pH 6 citrate buffer for 15 min and endogenous
peroxidase activity was inactivated with a 3% hydrogen
peroxide solution for 10 minutes. Unspecific stainings
were blocked using Superblock solution (TermoFisher
Scientific, Illkirch, France) for 1 hour at 37°C. Tissues
were then immuno-stained overnight at 4°C with one of
the following antibodies: anti-nucleophosmin (ab10530,
Abcam, Mulhouse, France, 1:5 000), anti-phosphoNPM1 Thr199 and Thr234/237 (respectively 619201
and 619101, Biolegend/Cliniscience, Nanterre, France,
69407

Oncotarget

1:150). Immuno-complexes were revealed using the antimouse and anti-rabbit ImPRESS reagent peroxidase kits
and the DAB substrate (Vector/Clinisciences). Tissues
were then stained with hematoxylin and dehydrated.
Slides were mounted using Eukitt medium. Protein
expression was scored as null (0), weak (1), moderate
(2) and strong (3) and the percentage of tumor cells
stained was noted. The multiplication of the score and
the percentage of stained tumor cells gave the quick
score (between 0 and 300). Evaluation was performed
separately by one genitourinary pathologist (YA) and by
two non-pathologists (DD and FV).

Immuno-precipitation

Cell culture

Cells (5x105) were seeded in 6-well plates, incubated
24 hours for adhesion and then treated or not with N6L as
indicated. For Western blotting, cells were lysed in RIPA
buffer and proteins were processed as previously described
[31]. Primary antibodies used were: anti-nucleophosmin
(1:1 000), anti-NPM1 Thr199 and Thr234/237 (1: 500)
and anti-AR (1:2 000) antibodies were the same as for
immunofluorescence experiments, anti-PSA (A0562,
Dako, Courtaboeuf, France 1:20 000) and anti-β-tubulin
(ab6046, Abcam, 1:1 000).
RT-PCR experiments were performed as previously
described [35].

Nuclear proteins were extracted using the NEPER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagent
(ThermoFischer Scientific). AR was immuno-precipitated
using 200 μg of nuclear proteins and 2 μg of AR antibody
(sc-7305, Santa-Cruz) at 4°C overnight. Immuno
complexes were recovered using magnetic beads (BioADEMTECH, PESSAC, France).

Sample preparation, western blot and RT-PCR
analyses

All cell lines were purchased from ATCC (American
Type Culture Collection/LGC Promochem, Molsheim,
France). 22RV1, DU145 and PC3 cells were cultured
in RPMI supplemented with 10% of fetal bovine serum
(FBS). LNCaP were cultivated in RPMI, 10% FBS, 2
nmol/L dihydrotestosteron (DHT) and VCaP in DMEM,
20% FBS, 2 nmol/L DHT. LNCaP-NE cells were obtained
from LNCaP cells cultivated in red phenol free RPMI,
10% cs-FBS (charcoal/dextran-treated serum) for 2 weeks
to 1 month. All culture reagents were purchased from Life
Technologies (Saint Aubin, France).

Cell viability assays

Immunofluorescence

Cells (1x104) were seeded in 96-multiwell plates,
incubated 24 hours for adhesion and treated as indicated
in 5% FBS medium. Cell viability was measured after
72 hours of treatment using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-diphenyltetrazolium bromide dye (MTT) method
(Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France). GI50 values were
calculated using the standard curve method. Combination
index (CI) were calculated with the Chou-Talalay
method using the calcusyn software (Cambridge, United
Kingdom). The CI value between 0.95 and 1.05 was
interpreted as suggestive of additivism, and >1.05 or <0.95
was suggestive of antagonism or synergism, respectively.

Cells (1.5x10 ) seeded on cover glass in 24-wells
plates were starved for 24 hours, stimulated with 10
nmol/L DHT for 1 hour and treated or not with N6L as
mentioned. Cells were fixed with cold methanol for 10
minutes and saturated (3% goat serum) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Primary antibodies were incubated
overnight at 4°C: anti-AR, sc-7305 and sc-816, SantaCruz (Heidelberg, Germany, 1:400) anti-NPM1, ab10530,
Abcam (1:500), anti-NPM1 Thr199 and Thr234/237,
respectively 619201 and 619101, Biolegend (1:200) and
secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa-Fluor 488/555,
A11029, A11034, A21424, A21429, Molecular Probes/
Clinisciences (1:1000) for 1 hour at room temperature.
Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/mL DAPI. Cover slips
were mounted with Mowiol mounting solution. Confocal
fluorescence images were acquired using an IX81 inverted
Olympus microscope equipped with a DSU spinning disk
confocal system (Olympus, Rungis, France), coupled to
an OrcaR2 CCD camera (Hamamatsu Corporation, Massy,
France) and were processed as previously described [49].
Briefly, cells were analyzed by acquiring axial z stacks
of confocal images (8 μm from the base to the top, with
steps of 0.5 μm). Residual blurring was removed by spatial
deconvolution. The two antibodies anti-phosphorylated
NPM1 from Biolegend were characterized for their
specificity to target phosphorylated NPM1 (Supplementary
Figure 1A and 1B).

Colony formation in soft agar
Colony formation was assessed as previously described
[50]. For LNCaP-NE colonies, when LNCaP colonies
reached 100 μm of diameter, media were changed by cs-FBS
media for 10 days and then the colonies were treated.

Subcutaneous tumor cell xenografts in nude mice
In the N6L/castration combination experiment,
VCaP cells (2x106 in PBS, 50 % Matrigel) were injected
subcutaneously in the right flank of four-week old male
NMRI nude mice. When the tumor reached about 400
mm3, mice were separated randomly in several groups.
Mice bearing tumors of about 600 mm3 were then

castrated by surgical testicular removal. Treatments
were performed as indicated. In the N6L/docetaxel
combination experiment, DU145 cells (5x106) were
injected subcutaneously in the right flank of four-week
old female NMRI nude mice. When the tumor reached
about 100 mm3, mice were separated randomly in several
groups. Treatments were assessed as indicated. Tumor
volume was measured as previously described [31]. All
in vivo experiments were carried out under the conditions
established by the European Community. Tumor analyzes
are described in the Supplementary Methods.

were then segmented by thresholding using the so called
« Triangle » method [51]. Grouped objects were then
sub-segmented using the watershed method. To finish,
individual objects were submitted to a sorting based on
their Signal/Noise ratio. This ratio was calculated for
each object as follows: the « Signal » value corresponds
to the maximum grey level encountered in the object
area projected onto the denoised initial image. « Noise »
corresponds to the minimal grey level encountered in
the outline of the same projection, added to a correction
value equal to 0.5 x SD. Objects were then considered
as significantly stained when their Signal/Noise ratio
was greater than 1.8. An example of the quantification is
shown on the Supplementary figure 6.

Immunohistochemical analysis on VCaP tumors
Immediately after surgical resection, VCaP tumors
were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C or were
fixed in formalin, included in paraffin and store at 4°C.
For apoptosis analysis, fragmented DNA on frozen slides
was stained using the ApopTag Isol Dual Fluorescent
kit (Millipore, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) as
previously described [31]. For angiogenesis, proliferation
and PSA expression analyses, tumors were sectioned at
5 μm thickness and deparaffinized. Antigen unmasking
was performed by heat retrieval with 10 mmol/L EDTA
pH 8 buffer for 20 minutes and endogenous peroxidase
activity was inactivated with a 3% hydrogen peroxide
solution for 10 minutes. Unspecific stainings were
blocked using Power Block Universal reagent (Biogenex
Laboratories/Microm Microtech, Francheville, France)
for 10 min at 37°C. Tissues were then incubated 2
hours at room temperature with anti-CD34 antibody (rat
monoclonal, HM1015, Clinisciences, 1:20), or anti-KI67
antibody (Mouse monoclonal, M7240, Dako, 1:50) or
PSA antibody (rabbit polyclonal, A0562, Dako, 1:1,000).
Immuno-complexes were revealed using HRP conjugated
secondary antibodies and the DAB substrate. Tissues were
then stained with hematoxylin and slides were mounted
using Mowiol medium. Quantification of peroxidase
positive objects (KI67 and CD34) was performed as
previously described [49]. PSA images were analyzed as
follows: labeling intensity corresponding to cells visually
considered as weakly stained was used as threshold level.
Objects which staining was higher than this value were
then detected and measured.
Numeration of positive apoptotic cells was
performed on fluorescent composite images with
an original plugin running on ImageJ [50]. Channel
corresponding to fragmented DNA labeling was first
normalized, and then submitted to a series of filters in
order to reduce noise, and to highlight only objects whose
size corresponds to cells. This filtering was achieved by
a gamma function (1.5) allowing to increase the intensity
range of objects which can be detected followed by an
unsharp filter (radius 40, weight 0.8) and a fast Fourier
transform band pass filter (10-100 pixels). At this step,
the transformed image consisting in smoothed objects

Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA
unpaired t test using the GraphPad Prism 4.0 software
(San Diego, CA). Values of p < 0.05 were considered
significant. Results were expressed as mean ± SD of
at least three determinations for each test from three
independent experiments.
