Tubulin-Targeting Chemotherapy Impairs Androgen
Receptor Activity in Prostate Cancer

Abstract
Recent insights into the regulation of the androgen receptor (AR) activity led to novel therapeutic targeting
of AR function in prostate cancer patients. Docetaxel is an approved chemotherapy for treatment of castrationresistant prostate cancer; however, the mechanism underlying the action of this tubulin-targeting drug is not
fully understood. This study investigates the contribution of microtubules and the cytoskeleton to androgenmediated signaling and the consequences of their inhibition on AR activity in human prostate cancer. Tissue
microarrays from docetaxel-treated and untreated prostate cancer patients were comparatively analyzed for
prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and AR immunoreactivity. The AR transcriptional activity was determined in
prostate cancer cells in vitro, based on PSA mRNA expression and the androgen response element reporter
activity. The interaction of AR with tubulin was examined by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence.
Treatment of prostate cancer patients with docetaxel led to a significant translocation of AR. In untreated specimens, 50% prostate tumor cells exhibited nuclear accumulation of AR, compared with docetaxel-treated tumors
that had significantly depleted nuclear AR (38%), paralleled by an increase in cytosolic AR. AR nuclear localization correlated with PSA expression. In vitro, exposure of prostate cancer cells to paclitaxel (1 μmol/L) or
nocodazole (5 μg/mL) inhibited androgen-dependent AR nuclear translocation by targeting AR association with
tubulin. Introduction of a truncated AR indicated the requirement of the NH2-terminal domain for AR-tubulin
interaction. Our findings show that in addition to blocking cell division, docetaxel impairs AR signaling, evidence that enables new insights into the therapeutic efficacy of microtubule-targeting drugs in prostate cancer.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most frequently diagnosed noncutaneous cancer and the third leading cause of cancer mortality
in men. Prostate cancer growth is dependent on androgens
and can be suppressed by androgen ablation (1). Nearly 90%
of all patients with metastatic prostate cancer initially respond to castration-induced androgen withdrawal (2). Unfortunately, the therapeutic response is limited to a median
duration of 18 to 24 months, with ultimate tumor recurrence
to a castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and progression to advanced disease. Considerable efforts have been devoted toward understanding the mechanisms contributing to
tumor therapeutic resistance and progression to metastasis.

This can be monitored indirectly through serum prostatespecific antigen (PSA), insofar as increasing PSA levels indicate that androgen receptor (AR) activity is functional
in CRPC.
Prior work has shown that the tubulin/microtubule system, which is an integral component of the cytoskeleton, is
a therapeutic target for prostate cancer treatment (3). Microtubules are highly dynamic structures that play a critical role
in orchestrating the separation and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis (4). Once the motor protein kinesin-1
is recruited to the microtubules, it preferentially moves various cargoes, including vimentin filaments and transferin,
along detyrosinated microtubules (5, 6). Tubulin-binding
agents are derived from natural sources and include a large
number of compounds with diverse chemical structures, all
sharing an ability to disrupt microtubule dynamics, induce
mitotic arrest, and promote apoptosis. The best characterized of these agents are the Vinca alkaloids and taxanes,
which at high doses cause microtubule destabilization and
microtubule stabilization, respectively. Two independent
multicenter phase III studies (Southwest Oncology Group
99-16 and TAX 327) compared taxane-based regimens
with mitoxantrone/prednisone and showed a significant
survival benefit in patients (7, 8). Docetaxel, a semisynthetic
taxane, stabilizes the microtubule by promoting binding to
β-actin. Once bound, microtubules cannot be disassembled,
thereby disrupting mitosis, causing G2M cell cycle arrest, and

Impact of Taxol Chemotherapy on Androgen Signaling

triggering apoptosis (9). Although docetaxel and prednisone
chemotherapy has become a first-line standard treatment
for metastatic CRPC, the efficacy of this therapy in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents is still under
investigation (3).
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the first-line treatment for advanced metastatic prostate cancer. After the
initial response, however, tumor relapse occurs in the majority
of patients due to the emergence of an androgen-independent
CRPC state (10). The dynamic relationship between prostate
cancer growth and the androgen signaling axis features a
unique complexity in its ability to drive tumor progression
and simultaneously dictate therapeutic potential. Androgeninduced prostate epithelial cell proliferation engages indirect
pathways involving paracrine mediators produced by stromal
cells (11, 12). The long-term benefit of androgen deprivation in
patients with metastatic disease has been the subject of debate (10, 13, 14). Recent breakthroughs in the development
of novel AR antagonist strategies led to phase I clinical trials
with the potential to improve the efficacy of AR targeting and
consequently the therapeutic outcome in patients with CRPC
(15). Paralleling these studies is the discovery that taxanes can
target prostate tumors through alternative routes besides mitosis disruption. Docetaxel counteracts the prosurvival effects
of Bcl-2 gene expression (16, 17). Bcl-2 is part of class of oncogenes that contributes to neoplastic progression by inhibition
of apoptotic cell death. Phosphorylation of Bcl-2 inhibits its
activity (9).
The clinical knowledge of paclitaxel as the only effective
treatment for CRPC calls for the need to understand the
mechanisms of action of this drug to augment its therapeutic efficacy. Considering the requirement of AR signaling to drive prostate growth and survival, and because
CRPC still retains AR activity, in this study we explored
the impact of tubulin and microtubule-targeting drugs on
AR signaling in prostate cancer. Our results show that
microtubule-targeting agents play a prominent role in impairing AR nuclear transport and activity, thus promoting
prostate tumor suppression. This evidence suggests a potential new mechanism underlying treatment failure (to
paclitaxel) of prostate cancer patients within the microtubule repertoire in CRPC.

Tissue microarray construction
A tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed from formalin-fixed representative tissues collected at prostatectomy
from the first 50 patients enrolled on the neoadjuvant chemotherapy study. Tissue cores (0.6-mm diameter placed
0.2 mm apart) were removed from the paraffin-embedded
prostate tissue blocks (donor blocks) and placed in a recipient paraffin block (30 × 25 mm) by using a precision Tissue
Arrayer (Beecher Instruments). Hematoxylin and eosin
(H&E) slides of each donor block were examined microscopically and reviewed by a pathologist to determine the appropriate location to sample. From every study patient, three
cores each of prostate cancer, normal prostate, and, where
applicable, lymph nodes with metastatic cancer were placed
in each block in a pseudorandomized fashion. Dispersed
among the study cores were control tissues from non–study
patients (liver, prostate, lymph node, salivary gland, kidney,
testis), untreated cell lines (DU-145, PC-3, LNCaP), and the
same cell lines treated with mitoxantrone and docetaxel
(alone or in combination). After completion, the block was
heated at 37°C for 30 minutes to ensure incorporation of
the cores into the block. The block was then cut into
5-μm-thick sections, and unstained slides were stored at
4°C until needed.
Microscopic evaluation of frozen sections of tissue samples identified the presence of adequate number of cancer
cells in both pretreatment and posttreatment samples for
31 subjects. Frozen sections (7 μmol/L) were cut from tissue
frozen in ornithine carbamyl transferase blocks, stained with
Mayer's hematoxylin (Sigma), dehydrated in 100% (v/v) ethanol and xylene, and used for laser capture microdissection
using an Arcturus PixCell IIe microscope (Arcturus, Inc.). To
evaluate gene expression alterations after chemotherapy, malignant epithelium from pretreated biopsy and posttreated
prostatectomy specimens were captured separately (3,000
cells per sample). The histology of captured cells was verified
both by review of an H&E-stained frozen section from each
sample and by review of the pre/post–laser capture microdissection images.

Cell lines. The LNCaP, CWR22, and PC-3 cell lines were
obtained from American Type Culture Collection and used
within 6 to 12 months. The androgen-sensitive and TGFβ–responsive human prostate cancer LNCaP TRII cells were
generated and characterized in our laboratory (19, 20).
Western blot analysis
Total cellular protein was extracted from the cell pellets by
homogenization in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer
[50 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 2 mmol/L
EDTA, 1% NP40, 0.1% SDS]. Protein samples (20–60 μg) were
loaded on 4% to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and
subjected to electrophoretic analysis and subsequent blotting. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody,
overnight at 4°C, and the relevant secondary antibodies
(1 hour at room temperature). Membranes were subsequently incubated with the enhanced chemiluminescence
system (Amersham BioSciences) and autoradiographed
using X-ray film (Amersham BioSciences). Densitometric
analysis was performed using the Scion Image program.
All bands were normalized to actin and shown as fold
change compared with controls.
Immunofluorescence analysis
Cells were plated (1 × 105 per well) in chamber slides. After
24 hours, cells were exposed to RPMI 1640 supplemented
with 10% charcoal-stripped serum in the presence of DHT
(1 nmol/L), TGF-β (5 ng/mL), or a combination of DHT
and TGF-β as indicated. Following treatment, cells were
fixed in 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized
in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were incubated with the
primary antibody overnight at 4°C and secondary antibody
for 1 hour at room temperature. Slides were mounted by
Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Inc.)
and were visualized and counted under a fluorescence
microscope (Olympus IX70 Inverted Microscope, Olympus
America, Inc.).

Prostate TMAs were subjected to immunohistochemical
analysis by using the following antibodies: the mouse monoclonal antibody against PSA and the rabbit polyclonal antibody against E-cadherin from Cell Signaling Technology,
Inc., and N-cadherin and AR (sc-7939 and sc815, respectively;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After blocking nonspecific binding with goat serum (1.5% in TBS-T) for 30 minutes at room
temperature, serial sections were exposed to the specific
antibodies overnight at 4°C (negative controls were incubated with IgG). Sections were subsequently exposed to biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1 hour, room temperature) and
horseradish peroxidase–streptavidin conjugate (Chemicon).
Color development was accomplished using a standard immunoperoxidase method (DakoCytomation LSAB2 systemHPR) and counterstaining with hematoxylin. Images were

pus America). Protein expression pattern, intensity, and
localization were assessed in formalin-fixed, paraffinembedded prostate cancer TMAs through light microscopy,
performed by two independent observers (NK and CB)
blinded to treatment modality. Three different cores were
measured for each patient. The overall pattern of staining
in human prostate tumor cells in the TMAs was determined
as the average number of positive epithelial cells in three
different fields for each tissue core.
Immunoprecipitation analysis
Cells were harvested in lysis buffer [10 mmol/L Tris
(pH 7.5), 1 mmol/L EDTA, 400 mmol/L NaCl, 10% (v/v)
glycerol, 5 mmol/L NaF, 0.5 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate,
1 mmol/L dithiothreitol] and Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Roche Biochemicals). Cell extracts were
homogenized, and protein content was quantitated using
the Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). Cell lysates (400 μg)
were precleared with protein A/G beads (Oncogene Research
Products) and were subsequently incubated with the AR or
the α-tubulin antibody (overnight at 4°C). Protein A/G beads
were then added to the cell lysate/antibody mixture. Following incubation (1 hour at 4°C), the lysate/antibody/bead
mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g (30 seconds). Beads
were subjected to elution with 100 mmol/L glycine (pH 3.0),
and eluate fractions were centrifuged at 14,000 × g in
1 mol/L phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). Samples were lysed
in SDS-PAGE buffer and analyzed by Western blotting as
described above.
RNA extraction and real-time reverse

RNA samples extracted with Trizol reagent were treated
with RNase-free DNase I and reverse transcript to cDNA
(Bio-Rad) Taqman real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis of the cDNA samples was conducted in an ABI 7700
Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Inc.) using
specific primers for PSA (Applied Biosystems).
Transient transfections and luciferase activity assays
Cells were plated (105 per well) in six-well plates and
treated as described above. After 48 hours, cells were transfected with the androgen response element (ARE) luciferase
construct (1 mg/well; from Dr. Zoran Culig, Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria) in the presence of the
control Renilla luciferase construct (Promega) using Tfx-50
transfection reagent (Promega). Following a 2-hour incubation with the DNA/Tfx50 mixture, serum-containing
medium was added to the cells and incubation was continued for 22 hours. After treatment, cells were harvested
and luciferase activity was determined according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Promega, Dual Luciferase Assay).

Results
Taxol chemotherapy inhibits PSA expression in
prostate cancer
Taxol chemotherapy reduces the serum PSA levels in
prostate cancer patients (21, 22). To investigate whether

the reduction in PSA is due to either tumor shrinkage or
signaling axis impairment, PSA expression was profiled in
prostate cancer epithelial cells by performing immunocytochemical analysis using the TMAs of human prostate specimens from docetaxel-treated prostate cancer patients. The
results shown on Fig. 1A reveal the effect of docetaxel
on tissue PSA expression in individual prostate tumor cells.
There was a marked decrease in PSA immunoreactivity
in the individual tissue arrays in response to microtubuletargeting drug treatment (Fig. 1B). Quantitative analysis of
the data revealed a significant reduction (19%) in the
intensity of PSA in prostate tumors from patients receiving
docetaxel, compared with specimens from untreated
patients (Fig. 1C).

Taxol inhibits AR transcriptional activity
Paclitaxel and nocodazole were used to disrupt normal cellular function of the microtubule system. Similar to docetaxel,
paclitaxel is a chemotherapy drug classified with the taxane
group and used in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer
(3). Nocodazole exerts its antitumor effect by interfering with
the polymerization of microtubules. Subsequent experiments
focused on determining the effect of microtubule-targeting
drugs on AR activation in vitro. The mRNA levels of PSA
were evaluated by quantitative PCR in response to DHT/
microtubule-targeting drugs. Treatment of human prostate
cancer LNCaP cells with DHT (1 nmol/L) for 24 hours led
to a significant increase in the expression of PSA mRNA.
Nocodazole completely abolished and paclitaxel partially inhibited this PSA induction (Fig. 2A). The changes in PSA protein levels were consistent with the mRNA changes in
response to treatment (Fig. 2B). To further investigate the
consequences of microtubule targeting on AR transcriptional
activity, the ARE-luciferase vector was introduced to LNCaP
cells in response to DHT in the presence of nocodazole or
paclitaxel. Activation of ARE was detected within 24 hours
of DHT treatment and was significantly inhibited by both
nocodazole and paclitaxel (Fig. 2C).
Taxol inhibits ligand-independent AR
transcriptional activity
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces ligand-independent
AR activation in prostate cancer cells with hypophysical
androgen level (23). To determine the effect of microtubuletargeting drugs on ligand-independent transcriptional activation of AR, EGF was used to induce the androgen-independent
activation of AR. A significant increase in PSA mRNA expression was detected in response to EGF in combination with
DHT, whereas nocodazole or paclitaxel ablated this PSA
mRNA induction within 24 hours (Fig. 3A). To investigate
whether the impaired AR transcriptional activity is specific
to microtubule-targeting drugs, two different drugs, Velcade
and Doxazosin, were examined (Fig. 3B). Exposure to either
one of these agents did not affect the androgen-mediated
PSA mRNA expression (Fig. 3C).
Microtubule-targeting chemotherapy inhibits AR
nuclear translocation
To further investigate the effect of Taxol drugs on AR function in prostate cancer cells, AR expression was evaluated in
docetaxel-treated prostate cancer patients. There was no
significant change in AR levels in prostate epithelial cells
between the two groups (Fig. 4A). However, marked changes
in the cellular localization of AR were observed in response
to docetaxel treatment. For the prostate specimens derived
from patients not receiving chemotherapy, 50% prostate cancer epithelial cells exhibited nuclear accumulation of AR,
whereas only 10% of the cell population had cytoplasmic localization of AR (Fig. 4B and C). For docetaxel-treated
patients, there was a marked reduction in nuclear translocation of AR (to 38%), with a parallel increase (to 29%) predominantly in the cytoplasm (Fig. 4B and C). The AR localization
also correlated with PSA expression level in prostate epithe-

cytoskeleton organization involved in the invasive behavior
of prostate tumor epithelial cells (24), we subsequently examined the consequences of Taxol chemotherapy on EMT.
Expression of E-cadherin, β-catenin (epithelial cell markers),
and N-cadherin (mesenchymal cell marker) was immunohistochemically profiled in the prostate TMAs from treated and
untreated patients. We found that docetaxel treatment had
no significant impact on EMT (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Tubulin interacts with the AR
Microtubule is the main cytoskeleton protein component
responsible for intracellular protein transportation and facilitates many cellular events. The potential interaction between AR and microtubules was subsequently investigated.
The interaction of endogenous AR and α-tubulin was detected in both LNCaP and CWR22 cells (Fig. 5D and E).

The colocalization of AR and tubulin was detected by yellow
immunofluorescence staining (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This
colocalization was reduced by DHT treatment (Fig. 5D and E;
Supplementary Fig. S1A). To further determine the interaction site of AR with tubulin, PC-3 prostate cancer cells were
transfected with different truncated forms of AR (Fig. 5F).
Loss of either the ligand-binding domain-hinge domain or
the DNA-binding domain cannot inhibit the interaction of
AR and tubulin, implicating the NH2-terminal domain as being responsible for the AR and tubulin association and potential interaction (Fig. 5G).

levels, an effect that was enhanced by TGF-β (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that the microtubule spindles were undetectable after androgen treatment (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
The present study documents that microtubule-stabilizing
chemotherapeutic agents interfere with AR nuclear localization and activity in human prostate tumors. The microtubule
network has been implicated in facilitating the nuclear import of cancer regulator proteins, including pTHrP, P53,
and Rb (25–27). There is a solid body of evidence supporting
the requirement for androgen-dependent and androgenindependent activation of AR and its nuclear translocation
toward downstream androgen signaling (28). In conjunction
with the shown association and potential interaction of AR
and tubulin, our findings raise the possibility that preferen-

tial binding of microtubules to AR may recruit AR to determine its transcriptional activity. Significantly enough,
microtubule-targeting chemotherapy was found to suppress
both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent AR signaling
in prostate cancer cells. Considering that nuclear protein importation is not directly dependent on microtubules (27), and
because AR function was not impaired by chemotherapeutic
agents nontargeting microtubules, such an effect seems to be
specific and indeed may represent a new mode of action for
microtubule-targeting drugs to regulate AR intracellular distribution in prostate tumors. Thus, the AR cytoplasmic “zip
code” determined by its localization becomes critical in targeting CRPC. In accordance with our findings, it was recently
reported that paclitaxel treatment increases the association
of FOXO1 (an AR-suppressive nuclear transcription factor)
with nuclear AR in prostate cancer cells (29).
These findings are important in enhancing the clinical
benefit generated by taxane-based regimens in prostate cancer patients with advanced disease. Clinical data reported by
two independent teams established that docetaxel-based
chemotherapy regimens lead to a significant survival benefit

A, prostate cancer cells LNCaP,
LNCaP TβRII, and CWR22 were
treated with DHT (1 nmol/L, 72 h),
and tubulin expression was
evaluated by Western blotting
using GAPDH as an internal
normalizing control. B, LNCaP
TβRII and CWR22 cells were
treated with DHT (1 nmol/L) with or
without TGF-β (5 ng/mL) for 72 h.
Tubulin expression was detected
by immunofluorescence (red);
nuclei were stained by 4′,6diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue).
C, emerging mechanistic scenario:
microtubules facilitate AR nuclear
translocation and enhance
downstream AR transcriptional
activity in prostate cancer
cells. Microtubule-targeting
chemotherapy blocks this pathway
and suppresses AR signaling
through a negative feedback
mechanism. AR signaling inhibits
tubulin expression, thus impairing
the cytoskeleton structure and
organization.

Impact of Taxol Chemotherapy on Androgen Signaling

in men with CRPC (7, 8). Microtubule stabilization through
binding of docetaxel to β-tubulin is the most widely accepted
mechanism of action. Once bound with taxanes, microtubules cannot disassemble; thus, the static polymerization disrupts the normal mitotic process and arrests cells in the G2M
phase, ultimately inducing apoptotic cell death. Another action of docetaxel is its antagonistic activity against the prosurvival effects of bcl-2. Treatment of prostate cancer cells
overexpressing bcl-2 with Taxol induces bcl-2 phosphorylation. Bcl-2 phosphorylation inhibits its binding to bax and
consequently apoptosis of prostate cancer cells in response
to Taxol (30). The present findings suggest another mechanism for taxane-based regimens toward impairing nuclear localization and activity of AR.
A popularized underlying mechanistic basis for the therapeutic failure to ADT is the emergence of androgen-independent
activation of AR responsible for driving and maintaining uncontrolled prostate tumor growth because ADT cannot impair the
ligand-independent pathway (31). In our study, microtubuletargeting chemotherapy drugs could inhibit both the androgendependent and androgen-independent activation of AR by
blocking AR nuclear translocation. Thus, it is tempting to
speculate on an additional level of tumor suppression action
by ADT. Addition of an AR-binding moiety to a therapeutic
agent such as Taxol could selectively target AR-expressing
prostate cancer cells. A potential combination of ADT and
taxanes may augment efficacy by targeting both androgendependent and androgen-independent prostate tumor growth.
Modification of tubulin (detyrosination/tyrosination) can
affect the microtubule stability (32). The present data indicate that binding of α-tubulin to AR engages the NH2-teminal
domain of AR as the required anchoring site. One could
argue that the evidence suggesting that androgens suppress
α-tubulin and impair the microtubules in prostate cancer
implicates a potential negative feedback regulation in microtubule AR (Fig. 6C). This feedback loop may explain the
reduced association and colocalization between AR and tubulin due to tubulin downregulation. Androgen signaling is
important in cell differentiation and regulates the cell cycle,
including G2M arrest (33, 34), consistent with its function in
inhibiting microtubule structures (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Our findings are in accordance with recent elegant molecular
dynamics–based studies indicating that a conjugate of
colchicine and an AR antagonist (cyanonilutamide) with
tubulin-inhibiting activity increases cytoplasmic AR levels
and anatagonizes AR activity in prostate cancer cells (35).
Moreover, indirect support for a microtubulin-targeting action influencing steroid receptor activity is gained from evidence on the ability of estrogens to regulate β-tubulin
synthesis and decrease microtubule density, ultimately
blocking prostate cancer cells at the G2M phase (36, 37).
In summary, our study documents the contribution of the
tubulin/microtubule repertoire to AR signaling in human
prostate cancer by sequestering AR in the cytoplasm toward
apoptotic signaling promotion and tumor growth inhibition.
Impairing this AR activity enables a previously unrecognized,
targeting forum for Taxol-based chemotherapy during prostate cancer progression (Supplementary Fig. S4) and supports a combination strategy of ADT with tubulin-targeting
chemotherapy toward an improved therapeutic response in
CRPC. The mechanisms through which this multifunctional
tubulin-targeting compound hinders the AR ligand-binding
pocket is currently being investigated.
