BACKGROUND. Ductal carcinoma of the prostate is a rare variant of prostate cancer
that presents most commonly with obstructive urinary symptoms or hematuria. This
case series of 6 patients is the first to report the outcome of ductal carcinoma treated
with external beam radiotherapy.

METHODS. A retrospective review was performed of patients treated between 1980
and 2006 at Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, Penn. Six patients were identified
with ductal carcinoma.

treated at recurrence 3 years after a radical prostatectomy. Patient ages ranged from
ng/mL. Three patients had a mixed acinar and ductal carcinoma, 2 with a Gleason
score (GS) of 8 and 1 with a GS of 7. Of the patients treated definitively, 4 had clinical
stage T2A-T2C and 1 had clinical stage T1B. Definitive radiotherapy was delivered to
the prostate with doses between 72 Gy and 78 Gy. Pelvic lymph nodes were treated in
all patients. One patient was treated postradical prostatectomy to the prostate bed to
a dose of 60 Gy. Adjuvant androgen deprivation was given in 5 of the patients. Two of
the patients died from metastatic disease at 1.4 and 7.1 years after treatment. The
remaining 4 patients remain alive between 3.2 and 4.8 years from treatment, with 3
patients biochemically without evidence of disease. No patients have developed a
local recurrence.

CONCLUSIONS. Ductal carcinoma of the prostate may be treated effectively with
external beam radiotherapy. Aggressive management is indicated, even with low-volume metastatic disease. Cancer 2007;109:2011–5.  2007 American Cancer Society.

uctal carcinoma of the prostate was originally identified by Melicow and Pachter in 1967.1 Thought initially to be a neoplastic proliferation of remnant paramesonephric tissue, it was given the name
‘Endometrioid’ carcinoma. More extensive pathologic analysis including ultrastructural studies have determined that these tumors, however, originate from the prostate and are now more correctly termed
ductal carcinoma, as a variant of the common acinar adenocarcinoma. Although these tumors are well recognized in the pathologic
literature and are generally thought to behave in an aggressive course,
there are no reports on outcome after radiotherapy or treatment
recommendations. We report on 6 patients who were treated at our
institution with a diagnosis of ductal carcinoma of the prostate.

searched to identify all patients who were seen and
treated for prostate cancer between 1980 and 2006.
Included patients were required to have evidence of either pure or mixed ductal carcinoma on biopsy of the
prostate or prostatic urethra. Six patients were identified from a total of 4521 (0.13%) patients. The pathologic material was reviewed at our institution
confirming the diagnosis. Clinical information regarding the presenting symptoms, investigations, and treatments were recorded from the patient charts, including
correspondence from treating physicians. Clinical staging was reported as per the AJCC 2002 recommendations.2 Time to biochemical failure, metastatic disease,
and death were recorded from the date of the completion of radiation therapy. Prostate-specific antigen
(PSA) doubling times were calculated pre- and postradiotherapy where data were available. Target volumes,
radiotherapy dose, and the timing and duration of
androgen deprivation were also recorded.

RESULTS
The details of each of the 6 cases are provided below.
Patient characteristics and treatment details are sum-

marized in Table 1. Patient outcomes are summarized
in Table 2.

Patient 1
A 66-year-old Caucasian man presented with obstructive urinary symptoms of increased urgency and nocturia. Digital rectal examination (DRE) revealed a hard
nodular prostate bilaterally without extracapsular
extension (T2C). His initial PSA (iPSA) was 100.3 ng/
mL. A transrectal ultrasound-guided (TRUS) biopsy
revealed a Gleason Score 3 1 4 acinar carcinoma in 3
of 6 cores with an associated ductal carcinoma involving 2 of the same cores. No cystoscopy was performed.
Initial bone scan and computed tomography (CT) were
negative for metastatic disease. The patient was treated
with external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to a dose of
72 Gy in 40 fractions to the prostate and 45 Gy in
25 fractions to the pelvic lymph nodes. No hormonal
therapy was instigated. After radiotherapy the PSA
reached a nadir of 3.2 ng/mL at 6 months. The PSA
then started to rise and by 2 years after the completion
of RT had reached 18.3 ng/mL, with a doubling time of
5.7 months. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone

RT in Ductal Carcinoma of the Prostate/Eade et al.

(LHRH) therapy was started. The PSA fell to 3.8 ng/mL.
The patient became hormone refractory 2 years after
commencing the LHRH therapy. The addition of maximum androgen blockade stabilized the PSA for a short
period; however, symptomatic bone metastases were
diagnosed 12 months after the addition of Casodex and
62 months after completing RT. Palliative RT between
20 Gy and 30 Gy was delivered on 3 occasions to different painful sites, with a good response. The patient died
2 years after his diagnosis of metastatic disease. He was
not known to have developed visceral metastases or
local recurrence at the time of death.

Patient 2
A 76-year-old Caucasian man presented with nocturia
and dysuria. His iPSA was 4.2. A transurethral resection
of the prostate (TURP) was performed and the pathology revealed a ductal carcinoma with comedo architecture. Subsequent clinical examination revealed a bulky,
hard prostate bilaterally without extracapsular extension (T2C) and TRUS biopsy of the prostate showed a
Gleason 4 1 4 acinar prostate cancer in 1 core. Bone
scan and CT scans were negative for metastases. The
patient was treated with EBRT to a dose of 72 Gy in 36
fractions to the prostate and 46 Gy in 23 fractions to the
pelvic lymph nodes. Concurrent and adjuvant hormonal deprivation was administered with an LHRH agonist. While still receiving LHRH therapy, and with a PSA
<0.1 ng/mL, the patient developed bone and liver metastases 1.2 years after completing RT. Biopsy of both
the liver and the bony lesions revealed malignant cells
similar to the initial TURP specimen and consistent
with metastatic ductal carcinoma. The patient died 2
months after his diagnosis of metastatic disease. His
PSA remained undetectable and there was no evidence
of local disease.
Patient 3
An 80-year-old Caucasian man presented with gross hematuria and was found to have a frond-like white
growth in the prostatic urethra on cystoscopy. Subsequent TURP diagnosed a ductal carcinoma. His PSA
had risen from 3.3 to 4.2 in the previous 30 months. No
biopsy of the prostate was performed. Before commencing RT, DRE revealed a diffusely hard prostate without
extracapsular extension consistent with T2C disease.
Staging with a whole-body bone scan and a CT scan of
the abdomen and pelvis showed no evidence of metastatic disease. The patient was treated with EBRT to a
dose of 78 Gy in 39 fractions to the prostate and 46 Gy
in 23 fractions to the pelvic lymph nodes. Hormonal
therapy with an LHRH agonist was administered concurrently with the RT and recommended for a further 2
years adjuvantly. The patient continued hormonal

2013

treatment for 4.5 years after RT at his own request. At
last follow-up, 3 months after completing androgen deprivation, testosterone remained suppressed (32 ng/
mL) and PSA remained undetectable. The patient
remains without clinical evidence of progression at 4.8
years from RT.

Patient 4
A 73-year-old Caucasian man was found to have a nodule on routine DRE at the left base of the prostate
(T2A). His iPSA was 1.69. Biopsy guided by TRUS
revealed 1 core positive with a mixed ductal and acinar
carcinoma (GS 4 1 4) in the left base. The remaining 5
cores were negative for malignancy. No cystoscopy was
performed. There was no history of urinary symptoms
and his American Urological Association (AUA) symptom score was 2. RT was delivered to the prostate and
pelvic lymph nodes to a dose of 78 Gy and 56 Gy,
respectively, in 39 fractions with intensity-modulated
RT. Hormonal therapy with an LHRH agonist was administered concurrently with RT and for 2 years adjuvantly. His PSA was undetectable while receiving
hormonal deprivation. At the last follow-up, 3.7 years
after completing RT, testosterone had returned to
within normal limits (533 ng/mL) and he was diseasefree, with a PSA of 0.5 ng/mL.
Patient 5
A 70-year-old Caucasian man presented with gross hematuria and cystoscopy revealed a papillary lesion on
the floor of the prostatic urethra. Pathology from a
transurethral resection was initially diagnosed as a
high-grade transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. A
repeat transurethral resection was performed and was
reported as ductal carcinoma of the prostate. On review
of the initial specimen, the initial diagnosis of transitional cell carcinoma was revised. The patient’s iPSA
was 6.6 ng/mL. A whole-body bone scan showed no
evidence of metastatic disease; however, a CT scan
showed 3 lesions within the right middle lobe of the
lung and a 4-cm lesion in the upper pole of the left kidney. The patient was started on LHRH agonist therapy
with a presumed diagnosis of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. His PSA decreased to 0.2 ng/mL on androgen
deprivation therapy. Nephrectomy confirmed a renal
cell carcinoma, which did not extend beyond the kidney. Wedge resection of the middle lobe lesions found
1 lesion to be a hamartoma; however, the 2 remaining
lesions were metastatic ductal carcinoma. Both of
these lesions were positive for CK20, CK7, and PSA, and
were morphologically similar to the prostatic lesion.
RT was subsequently delivered to the prostate and pelvic lymph nodes to a dose of 78 Gy and 56 Gy, respectively, in 39 fractions with intensity-modulated RT.

Androgen deprivation was continued for 2 years adjuvantly. At last follow-up, 3.6 years after completing RT
and 4.2 years after resection of his lung metastases, testosterone had returned to normal (631 ng/mL) and he
was disease-free, with a PSA of 0.2 ng/mL.

Patient 6
A 66-year-old Caucasian man presented initially with
dysuria. His PSA was 2.8 ng/mL. Cystoscopy showed a
mass in the prostatic urethra and after TURP a ductal
carcinoma was diagnosed. Biopsy of the prostate did
not reveal any definitive carcinoma cells, only cells suspicious for malignancy. The patient proceeded to a radical prostatectomy. The final pathology showed a mixed
papillary and cribriform ductal carcinoma involving the
left side of the prostate with extracapsular extension
and perineural invasion. The seminal vesicles were negative (pT3A), the margins were negative, and 0 of 11
lymph nodes were involved. After surgery the PSA was
undetectable. After 10 months the PSA increased to
0.12 ng/mL and by 35 months was 5.1 ng/mL, with a
doubling time of 3.4 months. The patient developed hematuria and cystoscopy revealed a recurrence at the
bladder neck, which was resected. Pathology confirmed
ductal carcinoma. After gross resection the PSA
remained elevated at 2.6 ng/mL. RT to the prostate bed
and bladder neck was delivered to 60 Gy in 30 fractions,
and an LHRH agonist was administered for 16 months.
The PSA remained undetectable during hormonal treatment. One year after ceasing hormonal therapy the PSA
increased to 0.12 ng/mL and 10 months after this the
PSA rose to 11.9 ng/mL (at last follow-up). Androgen
deprivation was reinitiated. There was no evidence of
local recurrence clinically 3.2 years after RT and 6.2
years after his radical prostatectomy.

DISCUSSION
Ductal carcinoma has been reported in approximately
0.2% of all prostate cancers. The common classic presentation is obstructive urinary symptoms or hematuria
due to a prostatic urethral mass; however, ductal carcinoma may also arise in the peripheral or secondary
periurethral ducts, either alone or in conjunction with
acinar adenocarcinoma. This histological type was initially described as arising from the verumontanum.
Architecturally, the cells are similar to endometrioid
cancer, which gave rise to the hypothesis that the cells
of origin were of remnant embryological origin. The
term ‘Endometrioid’ carcinoma was used until ultrastructure studies revealed both light nonciliated cells
and dark ciliated cells within 1 acinus.3 These same
investigators also found strong staining for acid phos-

phatase. The cell of origin is now thought to be prostatic.3
Primary and metastatic ductal carcinoma stains for
PSA and/or prostatic acid phosphatase in almost 100%
of cases.4–8 Mixed acinar and ductal carcinomas occur
in 48% to 87% of cases4,7,9,10 and may be in distinct
components or merged. When diagnosed by needle biopsy, over 50% of the patients will have high-volume
disease.9 PSA is expressed by ductal carcinoma cells,
but is not elevated in all patients. The possibility of PSA
production in an associated acinar component also
makes interpretation of the PSA difficult and, as such, a
normal serum PSA before surgery does not allow prediction of the final pathological stage.9 PSA cannot be
reliably used to risk-stratify patients.
Christensen et al.10 reported a detailed account of
15 patients treated initially by radical prostatectomy.
The mean age was 63 years and 9 of the 15 patients presented with obstructive urinary symptoms. Although
before surgery all of the patients appeared to have resectable disease, the final pathology revealed extracapsular extension in 93% and positive margins in 47%.
Pelvic lymph nodes were pathologically positive in 27%
and seminal vesicle invasion was found in 40% of the
patients. The resected tumors were large, with a mean
volume of 8.4 cc and involved a mean of 23% of the
prostate. Another series from Johns Hopkins reported
outcomes of 58 patients diagnosed by needle biopsy, of
which 20 were treated by radical prostatectomy.9 Similar to the previous experience, the extent of the tumors
was clinically underappreciated and pathologically 65%
had T3 disease, including 2 patients with seminal vesicle involvement. In this series >3 positive cores preoperatively were predictive of positive margins.
Although a number of patients with ductal carcinoma have been treated with RT, there have been no
previous reports on doses or response rates. The important observation from our series was the long-term disease control achieved in 5 of the 6 patients, with 4
patients still alive and 3 patients disease-free between
3.6 and 4.8 years. Patient 2 was an outlier, who rapidly
developed bony and visceral metastases and died 1.4
years from diagnosis with an undetectable PSA. In all of
the patients treated with definitive RT pelvic lymph
nodes were included in the initial treatment volume. In
no patient was a local recurrence detected. The benefit
of hormonal deprivation cannot be gauged from our series, but the addition of androgen deprivation was
recommended for all the patients after 1992 (Patient 1).
Patient 6 was treated 3 years after radical prostatectomy. On review of this case it is likely that metastatic
disease was present before salvage therapy, as the PSA
remained elevated despite removal of the recurrent urethral mass. Although not a curative treatment, RT in the

RT in Ductal Carcinoma of the Prostate/Eade et al.

setting of gross local recurrence appears to be of benefit
for local control.
The natural history of ductal carcinoma is conflicting. Initial reports were of an indolent tumor that in
some instances was observed for many years without
reported clinical progression.1,11 More recent series
have questioned this, reporting ductal carcinoma to
commonly behave in an aggressive fashion, with a poor
outcome.4,5,9,10 The exact role of hormonal deprivation
is unknown. Initially the hypothesis of endometrial origin led clinicians to not utilize androgen deprivation in
fear of stimulating the tumor growth.12 Case reports of
patients responding to antiandrogen therapy were subsequently described.5,7 These findings combined with
evidence that the ductal carcinoma cells are of prostatic
origin has given rise to the routine use of androgen deprivation. An analysis of the hormonal expression of
ductal carcinomas from 12 patients showed estrogen
receptor reactivity in none of the 12, with positive staining for androgen receptors in 10 of the patients.8 The
overall response to androgen deprivation is not as predictable as acinar carcinoma and some tumors will
show no response.
Ductal carcinoma of the prostate has been reported
to metastasize to lymph nodes and bone, similar to acinar carcinoma,4,5 although 2 series have highlighted a
more unusual pattern of spread including 8 patients
with liver metastases6 and 7 patients with metastases to
the testicle or penis.13 Patient 5 in our series displayed a
remarkable history, presenting with synchronous renal
cell cancer and metastatic ductal carcinoma to the lung.
After resection of the 2 lung metastases, RT to the prostate, and hormonal deprivation the patient is currently
disease-free 4.2 years after the resection of his lung metastases. Patients with pulmonary metastases from ductal carcinoma have been reported previously. Millar
et al.7 described a 74-year-old man who developed pulmonary metastases 2 years after a diagnosis of a papillary ductal carcinoma of the verumontanum. There was
a response to androgen deprivation and the patient was
alive at 11 years from diagnosis. Gong et al.6 reported on
23 patients with metastatic ductal carcinoma, which
included 3 patients with pulmonary metastases. Two of
these patients remained alive 21 months and 3 months
after diagnosis, whereas the third patient died 46 months
after diagnosis of his metastatic disease.

Recommendations
Ductal carcinoma of the prostate may be present as a
urethral mass or within the prostate and at diagnosis
both a cystoscopy and a TRUS prostate biopsy should be
obtained if possible. If a urethral mass is present, maximum transurethral resection is indicated before RT. Staging with whole-body bone scan and CT of the chest,

2015

abdomen, and pelvis should be performed in all patients.
On biopsy, if >3 cores are positive there is a high likelihood of extracapsular extension and positive margins.
Due to the possible extensive nature of the local disease,
postoperative RT may be required after radical prostatectomy. Because the extent of disease is often underappreciated and PSA levels may not be representative, caution
should be used in extrapolating risk models used in acinar carcinoma to make recommendations regarding surgery or definitive RT. As ductal carcinomas are often
mixed with an acinar component, are usually bulky, histologically are considered high grade, and may respond
to androgen deprivation, we recommend aggressive
treatment. Our approach is to administer definitive prostate doses in the 80 Gy range, treatment of the pelvic
lymph nodes, and 2–3 years of androgen deprivation in
all patients irrespective of iPSA or clinical T-stage. Despite the presence of visceral metastatic disease, longterm disease-free intervals are possible and aggressive
local treatment should be considered.
