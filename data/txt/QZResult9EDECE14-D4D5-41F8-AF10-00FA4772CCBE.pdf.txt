ABSTRACT
The clinical significance of Cluster of Differentiation 44 (CD44) remains
controversial in human ovarian cancer. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
clinical significance of CD44 expression by using a unique tissue microarray, and
then to determine the biological functions of CD44 in ovarian cancer. In this study, a
unique ovarian cancer tissue microarray (TMA) was constructed with paired primary,
metastatic, and recurrent tumor tissues from 26 individual patients. CD44 expression
in TMA was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Both the metastatic and recurrent
ovarian cancer tissues expressed higher level of CD44 than the patient-matched
primary tumor. A significant association has been shown between CD44 expression
and both the disease free survival and overall survival. A strong increase of CD44 was
found in the tumor recurrence of mouse model. Finally, when CD44 was knocked down,
proliferation, migration/invasion activity, and spheroid formation were significantly
suppressed, while drug sensitivity was enhanced. Thus, up-regulation of CD44
represents a crucial event in the development of metastasis, recurrence, and drug
resistance to current treatments in ovarian cancer. Developing strategies to target
CD44 may prevent metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance in ovarian cancer.

to standard chemotherapeutic regimens will inevitably
relapse with metastasis, recurrence, and drug resistance.
However, the mechanisms of development of relapsed
ovarian cancer are still largely unknown.
Cluster of Differentiation 44 (CD44) is a polymorphic
group of proteins, mainly owing to alternatively spliced
exon transcripts in the extracellular domains [5]. The
heterogeneity of the protein products vary on different cell
types and growth conditions (all termed as CD44 in this
study). The smallest CD44 isoform, which is also known
as standard or haematopoietic isoform, is ubiquitously
expressed on the membrane of most vertebrate cells
[6], while other larger CD44 splice variants are merely
present on limited types of epithelial tissue [7]. The CD44
transmembrane glycoprotein family mediates diverse
cellular processes, which involve the regulation of growth,

INTRODUCTION
Epithelium ovarian carcinoma ranks fifth in lethal
tumors among women, accounting for more deaths than
any other cancer of the female genital tract. Based on the
estimation of ovarian cancer for 2014 by the American
Cancer Society, approximately 21,980 women will receive
a new diagnosis of ovarian cancer, and near 14,270
women will succumb to this disease in the United States
[1]. Conventional combinations of primary cytoreductive
surgery and paclitaxel-platinum chemotherapy have not
had a significant impact on overall survival of ovarian
cancer in last several decades [2, 3]. The overall five-year
survival rates of patients diagnosed at stage III and IV
of this disease is 32% and 18%, respectively [4]. Most

survival, differentiation, and motility. Despite CD44
is frequently expressed in a wide variety of epithelial
malignancies, including ovarian cancer. However, the
clinical significance of CD44 remains controversial. Some
studies have concluded that an association between CD44
expression and poor prognosis or survival outcome [8, 9],
whereas other studies did not demonstrate any correlations
of these two factors [10, 11]. Few studies have investigated
CD44 expression in ovarian cancer patients with long-term
follow up. No previous CD44 studies have been carried
out with paired primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumor
tissues from each individual ovarian cancer patient. Most
importantly, the effect of chemotherapy treatment on CD44
expression in ovarian cancer is also unknown. The aim of
this study is to further investigate and clarify expression and
function of CD44 in ovarian cancer.

initial immunohistochemistry results, follow-up analysis
were performed to analyze the association of CD44
expression and ovarian cancer progression and prognosis.
Patients were sorted according to CD44 expression
score (weak CD44 staining score ranging from 0 to 1+,
and strong CD44 staining score ranging from 2+ to 3+).
A significant tendency of CD44 overexpression towards
unfavorable prognosis was displayed in analysis of both
overall survival and disease free survival, with P values
at 0.010 and 0.036, respectively (Figure 1 Panel C and D).

CD44 is overexpressed in drug resistant ovarian
cancer cell lines
Late-stage ovarian cancer exhibits more aggressive
tumor progression, especially resistant to conventional
chemotherapeutic drugs. Based on the results of CD44
immunostaining in our TMA, we further examined
the relative expression levels of CD44 in two pairs of
well-characterized drug sensitive and resistant ovarian
cancer cell lines-SKOV-3/SKOV-3TR and OVCAR8/
OVCAR8TR. The western blot results demonstrated
that only SKOV-3TR and OVCAR8TR exhibited strong
expression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp), however both the
drug sensitive and drug resistant cell lines presented a
ubiquitous level of CD44 expression. Moreover, SKOV3TR and OVCAR8TR expressed significantly higher
levels of CD44 than parental sensitive cell lines (Figure 2
Panel A and B).

RESULTS
Unique features of the constructed human
ovarian cancer TMA
In previous studies, most reports used a TMA
either from different disease stages or from various
histopathological types in large patient cohort [12–15].
The TMA utilized in our current study was generated from
26 well-characterized late-stage ovarian cancer patients
with long-term follow-up (Supplementary Table S1). The
unique features of our TMA are that tissues are collected
from paired primary, metastatic, and recurrent tumor tissues
each from 26 individual patients. To our knowledge, no such
human ovarian cancer tumor TMA has been constructed
in former reports. Most patients were grade 3 at time of
diagnosis, while there were four grade 2 patients and one
grade 1 patient. All the patients were disease stage III
to IV with various pathological types, including serous,
transitional cell, endometroid, clear cell, undifferentiated
cell, etc. The time range of DFS was between 5.3 months
and 53.3 months; the shortest OS of a patient was 12 months,
and the longest follow-up of a living patient is 162.3 months.

Overexpression of CD44 in the tumor recurrence
of human ovarian cancer xenograft model
during paclitaxel treatment
Paclitaxel is the first-line chemotherapy drug in the
treatment of ovarian cancer. However, little is known about
the alteration of CD44 expression in recurrent ovarian
cancer during chemotherapy. After an ovarian cancer
xenograft model was established, the mice were treated
with different regimes of paclitaxel and tumor tissues
were harvested at different stages (Figure 2 Panel C).
The ovarian-tumor-bearing nude mice dosed with 25 mg/
kg paclitaxel were euthanized after two months, while
tumor tissues from mice treated with saline, paclitaxel
(10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg) were collected after one month
due to large tumor volume (exceeding 1000 mm3). To
investigate the dynamic variations of CD44 in vivo, the
relative protein level of CD44 was detected and analyzed
by western blot and densitometry. No significant difference
was observed between low-dosage (10 mg/kg) paclitaxel
treated nude mice and saline treated ones; however, there
is a slight increase of CD44 in 20 mg/kg paclitaxel treated
mice, and dramatic overexpression of CD44 in mice dosed
with 25 mg/kg paclitaxel. These results indicated that the
expression of CD44 will increase in the tumor recurrence
of ovarian cancer (Figure 2 Panel D and E).

Increased expression of CD44 in metastatic and
recurrent ovarian cancer tissues, and correlated
with poor clinical outcome
Almost all of the tumor specimens presented various
degrees of CD44 expression on the cell membrane (Figure 1
Panel B). Although no remarkable differences of the
overall mean CD44 immunostaining scores were observed
between patient-matched metastasis and recurrent ovarian
cancer tumors, the expression level of CD44 was lower
in primary ovarian cancer tissue than in synchronous
metastasis and recurrence, with a significant difference
of approximately 0.6 in staining intensity (P value of
metastatic vs. primary = 0.034; P value of recurrent vs.
primary = 0.037; Figure 1 Panel A). In order to clarify the

efficiency; protein of OVCAR8 cells cultured in regular
medium without any treatment was used as the control.
As expected, no any alterations of CD44 were presented
in OVCAR8Lentivirus only and OVCAR8Non-specific shRNA cells in
comparison with the control, whereas the protein level
of CD44 was remarkably suppressed in OVCAR8CD44
shRNA
cells. Moreover, none of the cell lines presented
the expression of Pgp (Figure 3 Panel C). Hence, all
the three cell lines (OVCAR8Lentivirus only, OVCAR8Nonspecific shRNA
, and OVCAR8CD44 shRNA) were successfully
established and well characterized. Next, proliferation
of the aforementioned four cell lines was assessed
by MTT assay. There was obvious growth inhibition
in OVCAR8CD44 shRNA and no significant difference in
cell growth among other control cell lines (OVCAR8,
OVCAR8Lentivirus only, and OVCAR8Non-specific shRNA) (Figure
3 Panel D). Furthermore, after 7-day culture in 3-D
environment, which mimics in vivo settings, the diameter
of spheroids formed by OVCAR8CD44 shRNA was relatively
smaller than other cell spheroids (Figure 3 Panel E and F).
These results suggested that CD44 enhances the
development and progression of ovarian cancer cells.

As indicated in the western blot results, OVCAR8
expresses CD44. In order to investigate the biology of
CD44 in ovarian cancer, we stably transduced ovarian
cancer OVCAR8 cells by a lentivirus-mediated gene
transfer system expressing CD44 shRNA. The controls
were the cells without any treatments and the cells
transfected with an empty vector or lentivirus-based
non-specific shRNA. During the treatment period, it was
observed that nearly all the untreated OVCAR8 cells
were killed by 2 μg/ml puromycin on Day 5, whereas
there was prominent cell survival in empty vector and
lentivirus-based non-specific shRNA treated wells, and
half the cells transduced with lentivirus-based CD44
shRNA were still alive (Figure 3 Panel B). We then
selected and sub-cultured the remaining viable cells in
all the microplate wells, except for the blank control
wells. Total protein was extracted to verify transduction

Knockdown of CD44 by esiRNA in ovarian

To examine whether repression of CD44 levels
would increase the drug sensitivity of ovarian cancer
cells, the MTT assay was performed on the established
cell lines OVCAR8Lentivirus only, OVCAR8Non-specific shRNA,
and OVCAR8CD44 shRNA after incubating with paclitaxel.
OVCAR8 cells without any treatment were used as the
control. The representative pictures of different cells dosed
with 0 μM paclitaxel and 0.006 μM paclitaxel were shown
in Figure 4 Panel A. The results showed minimal survival
of OVCAR8CD44 shRNA in medium containing 0.006 μM
paclitaxel, while a substantial number of OVCAR8,
OVCAR8Lentivirus only, and OVCAR8Non-specific shRNA cells were
still able to tolerate this level of paclitaxel exposure. Further
analysis of the MTT data indicated that knockdown of CD44
significantly restored the sensitivity to chemotherapeutic
drug paclitaxel in OVCAR8 (Figure 4 Panel B).

Drug resistant ovarian cancer is more intractable
in the clinical environment. CD44 is overexpressed in
drug resistant ovarian cancer cell lines (Figure 2 Panel
A and B); therefore, we examined whether disruption of
CD44 expression would influence the function of SKOV3TR and OVCAR8TR. Western blot was conducted to
detect the efficacy of CD44 esiRNA transfection in vitro.
It was found that CD44 esiRNA transfected cells showed
significantly reduced protein levels of CD44, compared
with untreated cells and cells dosed with non-specific
siRNA (Figure 5 Panel A). Moreover, the level of CD44
expression was suppressed by CD44 targeted esiRNA in
a dose dependent manner, as determined by densitometry
quantification. Specifically, when normalized to untreated
cells, the expression levels of CD44 in cells transfected
with 18 nM, 36 nM and 54 nM CD44 esiRNA were

and 48.7%, 29.2%, and 13.1% for OVCA8TR. However,
knocking down of CD44 has no significant influence on
Pgp expression (Figure 5 Panel B). In addition, results
from the immunofluorescence study further showed that

wounds were almost recovered after 24-hour migration
in blank control and non-specific siRNA treated cells.
However, the wound healing showed a substantial
inhibition when the cells were subjected to CD44
esiRNA, especially at higher concentrations. During
the 24-hour incubation, the relative migratory distances
of SKOV-3TR cells transfected with 36 nM and 54
nM CD44 esiRNA were 32.67 mm and 22.15 mm,
respectively; the OVCAR8TR cells dosed with 36
nM and 54 nM CD44 esiRNA migrated merely 61.54
mm and 45.19 mm (Figure 6 Panel A and B). To
assess whether the invasive potential of drug resistant
ovarian cancer cells changed in vitro when lacking
CD44, transwell invasion assays were carried out after
transfection using different concentrations of CD44
esiRNA. The average numbers of CD44 esiRNA (36 nM
and 54 nM) treated OVCAR8TR cells invading through
the matrigel were significantly lower in contrast
with the blank control and the non-specific siRNA
groups (Figure 6 Panel C and D). Taken together,

cells increased sensitivity to the anticancer drug paclitaxel.
Results from drug sensitive and resistant cell lines and
from xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer indicated
that up-regulation of CD44 is a critical event during the
progression of ovarian cancer.
The development of TMA technology introduces
a cost-effective and efficient technique in conducting
research. A large number of tumor samples can be processed
simultaneously under uniform immunohistochemical
experimental conditions [16]. This platform has facilitated
evaluating the correlations between molecular variations
and clinicopathological characteristics of tumors in a vast
number of publications so far, including ovarian cancer.
Various human ovarian cancer TMAs have been constructed
in previous investigations. For instance, TMAs containing:
136 cases of epithelial ovarian carcinoma (108 high-grade
serous carcinoma and 28 clear cell carcinoma) [12]; a larger
patient cohort (serous 357, endometrioid 37, mucinous 88,
clear cell 14, etc.) [13]; 144 formaldehyde fixed-paraffin
embedded primary ovarian tumors (grade 1 to 3, FIGO
stage I to IV) [14]; and 99 primary epithelial ovarian

DISCUSSION
In the current study, we provided a comprehensive
overall expression profile of CD44 in ovarian cancer,
from individual patients’ clinical primary tumor tissue
to metastasis and recurrence, and from tumor cell lines
to xenograft mouse model. Our study demonstrated that
both the metastatic and recurrent ovarian cancer tissues
expressed higher levels of CD44 than patient-matched
primary tumor samples. A pronounced association
between the expression of CD44 and disease-specific
survival and overall survival was observed through TMA
immunohistochemistry analysis. When CD44 was stably
inhibited by its specific shRNA, the proliferation speed
and spheroids formation of ovarian cancer cells was
inhibited under 3-D culture conditions. We also found that
knocking down CD44 impaired the migratory and invasive

cancers, 22 peritoneal metastasis, and 13 normal ovarian
samples [15]. To the best of our knowledge, no former
studies have utilized the tumor TMA as what we used in
this study, which was generated by 26 well characterized
late-stage ovarian cancer patients with long-term followup. The particularly remarkable feature of this TMA is that
each patient possessed a primary tumor, a synchronous
metastasis, and a metachronous recurrence obtained at
the time of tumor progression after initial surgery and
specific platinum- and/or paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.
The metastatic and recurrent tumor sites disseminated a
wide spectrum of organs, such as ovary, sigmoid, liver,
brain, omentum, etc. Epithelial ovarian cancers are a
particularly heterogeneous type of tumor, in part due to
their large size and different histological subtypes [17, 18].
In this regard, three core biopsies from morphologically
representative areas of each paraffin-embedded tumor
tissue block were identified and collected to minimize the
variability. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that we have
previously applied this TMA to prove the hypothesis that
expression of pStat3 and inflammatory infiltration increased
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in recurrent and metastatic ovarian cancer tissues [19].
Despite the limited numbers of cases, the results deriving
from this unique human TMA will provide more valuable
information.
As a multifaceted and multifunctional molecule,
CD44 has attracted substantial interest since its first
description [20]. CD44 is known to regulate several
essential cellular and molecular events, including
organ development, neuronal axon guidance, numerous
immune functions, haematopoiesis, and pathological
processes [21–23]. Induction of CD44 expression has
been addressed during the progression of ovarian cancer.
However, the role of CD44 expression in epithelial ovarian
cancer has not been clarified and the clinical significance
of CD44 in ovarian cancer remains controversial [8–11].
On the basis of immunohistochemistry staining of our
unique TMA, we found that the expression of CD44
was more pronounced in the recurrent and metastatic
ovarian cancer tissues, when compared with its primary
counterparts. There was a significant correlation between
CD44 expression and disease free survival and overall

survival. Consequently, our investigations demonstrated
that high expression of CD44 predicts an unfavorable
prognosis in ovarian carcinoma.
Among the critical characteristics of an aggressive
malignant ovarian cancer phenotype are rapid cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion. CD44 plays an
important role in communication of cell-matrix interactions,
cell motility, matrix degradation, proliferation, and survival.
Previous reports have found that suppressing CD44 by
its specific siRNA dramatically decreases the migratory
potentials and invasiveness of ovarian cancer cells [24–26].
We have similar findings when knocking down CD44 by
efficient and specific esiRNA in malignant drug resistant
ovarian cancer cell lines. More importantly, stable CD44
knockdown ovarian cancer cell lines and their negative
controls have been well established, characterized, and
intensively studied in the current work. Those cell lines
were cultured in 3-D environment, which can mimic in vivo
growth conditions. When CD44 was stably knocked down
by targeted shRNA, the formation of spheroids under 3-D
culture and the growth speed were significantly suppressed.
In recent in vivo reports, there was effective tumor shrinkage
in xenograft models by suppressing CD44 mRNA and
protein [24, 27]. It has been demonstrated that peritoneal
cells produce several extracellular matrix molecules that
interact with CD44 receptor, such as hyaluronic acid (HA,
hyaluronan, a linear polymer of repeating disaccharide
units [D-glucuronic acid (1-β-3) N-acetyl-D-glucosamine
(1-β-4)]n), collagen, osteopontin (OPN), and L-selectin and
E-selectin, etc [28–31]. The principal molecule among these
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

is HA; when CD44 on the surface of ovarian cancer cells
binds to HA on mesothelial cells, this combination may
trigger peritoneal metastasis [32, 33]. A study focused on
colon cancer has also demonstrated that CD44 expressed
on the cell surface can facilitate binding endothelial P- or
L-selectin and increase haematogenous spread of tumor
[34]. Although the role CD44 expression plays in ovarian
cancer recurrence, metastasis, and drug resistance is
unknown, the results showing that knockdown of CD44
inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration/invasion
provides evidence that CD44 may directly participate in
ovarian cancer progression.
Tumor recurrence under common cytotoxic
chemotherapy is one of the most challenging problems
in cancer treatment, not limited to ovarian cancer.
Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms elucidating tumor
recurrence and chemoresistance are widely investigated
but still poorly understood. In this study, overexpression
of CD44 was found in the tumor recurrence of xenograft
mouse model undergoing paclitaxel treatment. The present
work, to our knowledge, is the first evaluation of CD44
expression during paclitaxel treatment in vivo. Moreover,
the expression level of CD44 was also examined in
paclitaxel-resistant cell lines. The expression of CD44
was significantly higher in the paclitaxel-resistant cells
lines than in the drug sensitive parental cell lines. Previous
studies have shown that reducing the expression level of
CD44 by siRNA increased sensitivity to doxorubicin in
breast cancer [35]. Downregulation of CD44 by miR199a-3p significantly increased the chemosensitivity

to obtain representative triplicate 0.5-mm-diameter core
biopsies of primary, metastasis, and recurrent ovarian
cancer tumors (absence of necrosis, poorly differentiated
tumor areas). Pathological identification of diagnosis
and staging of all the patients was in accordance with
World Health Organization criteria and the Federation
International of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO)
guidelines on the management of ovarian cancer [42–44].
Other relevant clinical information was also collected,
including ascites present at surgery, disease free survival
(DFS) as the interval between date of diagnosis and date
of recurrence, overall survival (OS) as the interval from
date of surgery to death or to last follow-up (for censored
events), as well as current patient status. The process of
case collection was approved by the Institutional Review
Board at Massachusetts General Hospital.

of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin, pacitaxel, and
adriamycin [27]. In accordance with the previous studies,
we demonstrated that stable suppression of CD44 by
lentivirus-based CD44 shRNA increased sensitivity to
paclitaxel. Overexpression of MDR1 protein Pgp acts
as an energy-dependent drug efflux pump to pump out
many structurally unrelated chemotherapeutic drugs.
It has been recognized as one of the well characterized
mechanism for resistant to drug, including paclitaxel
[36, 37]. Importantly, either transient or stable knockdown
of CD44 cannot induce the alteration of Pgp in drug resistant
or sensitive phenotypes. Although the mechanism by which
CD44 induces drug resistance and tumor recurrence is
unknown, our findings indicate that this does not appear
to be via MDR1-dependent mechanism. Hedgehog
signaling pathway has been shown to be important in the
maintenance of chemotherapy resistance in a subgroup of
CD44+ gastric cancer cells [38]. Overexpression of CD44
has also been shown to promote resistance to etoposideinduced apoptosis by alteration of levels of caspase 9,
caspase 3, Bcl-xl, and Bak, down-regulation of pRB, and
phosphorylation of AKT in colon cancer [39]. Genetic loss
of CD44 in murine chronic lymphocytic leukemia had a
negative impact on the phosphoactivation of important
antiapoptotic regulators, ERK1/2 and AKT kinases [40].
Another potential mechanism is that CD44 functions
in drug resistance as an antiapoptotic factor through upregulation of Bcl-xL in breast cancer [41].
In conclusion, we demonstrate CD44 is significantly
up-regulated during the progression of human ovarian
cancer, including recurrence, metastasis, and acquisition of
drug resistance. CD44 plays crucial roles in ovarian cancer
cell growth, migration, and invasion. These results suggest
that developing new strategies to target CD44 in ovarian
cancer may prevent recurrence, metastasis, and drug
resistance, and improve the clinical outcome of ovarian
cancer patients.

Immunohistochemistry
The expression level of CD44 was determined
based on the Immunohistochemistry Protocol (Paraffin)
from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Briefly,
5-μm paraffin tissue section slides were baked at 60°C
for 1 hour, deparaffinized in xylene for 10 minutes, and
then transferred through graded ethanol for rehydration.
Following the process of antigen retrieval, endogenous
peroxidase activity was quenched by incubation in 3%
hydrogen peroxide. After protein blocking with blocking
solution (Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 hour at
room temperature, primary antibody was applied at 4°C
overnight in a humidified chamber. Each step preceded
three Tris-buffered saline (TBS) rinses, and the bounded
antibody on the array was detected by using SignalStain®
Boost Detection Reagent (Cell Signaling Technology) and
SignalStain® DAB (Cell Signaling Technology). Prior to
imaging, the section was counterstained with hematoxylin
QS (Vector Laboratories) and mounted with VectaMount
AQ (Vector Laboratories) for long-term preservation. The
expression of CD44 was evaluated by two scientists who
had no knowledge of the clinical data and the other viewer’s
score. The immunostaining intensity pattern of CD44 was
assessed on a scale semiquantitatively as follows: 0, no
staining; 1+, weak staining; 2+, moderate staining; and 3+,
intense staining. Scoring was calculated from the mean of
the two independently conducted assessments.

were recruited in this study. The archived, formalin-fixed,

TMA, which was generated by the Tissue Microarray Core
at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center. Each of these
26 patients’ tumor tissue blocks were composed of: 1) a
primary tumor, 2) a synchronous metastasis obtained at
the time of the primary surgery, and 3) a metachronous
recurrence from the same patient collected at the time
of tumor recurrence after platinum- and taxane-based
chemotherapy treatment. Haematoxylin and eosin-stained
slides from each tissue block were read by a senior

Tumor xenograft model and treatment
In order to determine the effect of chemotherapy
treatment on CD44 expression in ovarian cancer in vivo,
an ovarian cancer xenograft mouse model was established
and paclitaxel treatment was subsequently carried out.
Specifically, SKOV-3 cell suspension (2 × 106) was
mixed with matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) in
volume ratio 1: 1, and the mixture was injected into the
9321

Oncotarget

flanks of 4–6-week-old Crl:SHO-PrkdcSCIDHrhr nude
female mice (Charles River Laboratories, Ann Arbor,
MI) subcutaneously. Approval of the study protocol
was obtained and supervised by Massachusetts General
Hospital Subcommittee on Research Animal Care (SRAC).
When the tumor volume of mice reached approximately
150 mm3, the mice (six per group) were randomly assigned
to control or treatment groups, and dosed with saline or
different dosages of paclitaxel (10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg,
25 mg/kg, respectively) by tail vein injection. The treatment
schedule was conducted twice a week until the tumor grew
larger than 15 mm in diameter or exceeded 1000 mm3.
The health of the mice was monitored daily during the
treatment period. The animals were weighed and tumor
size was measured by a caliper twice a week. At the end
of the experiments, the animals were euthanized; tumors
were harvested and stored at –80°C for protein extraction.

sequence targeting CD44 corresponded to coding regions
(5′-CCGGATGGACTCCAGTCATAGTATACTCGAGTA
TACTATGACTGGAGTCCATTTTTTG-3′) of the CD44
gene. As compared with siRNA or esiRNA, which can
transiently (usually between 24 to 96 hours) knockdown
gene expression as described above, the advantage of
using lentiviral shRNA is the ability to create a stable
CD44 knockdown cell line. OVCAR8 expresses CD44 to
some extent and is susceptible to the lentivirus-screening
antibiotic puromycin. Hence, OVCAR8 was used to
establish the stable CD44 knockdown ovarian cancer cell
line in this study. Briefly, OVCAR8 cells were seeded
(2 × 103 per well) in a 96-well microplate and incubated
with CD44 shRNA lentivirus for 24 hours at 37°C in
a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2.
Untreated cells were used as blank control; a lentiviral
empty vector and lentivirus-based non-specific shRNA
were used as negative controls. Each lentiviral construct
and control was plated in duplicate wells. Hexadimethrine
bromide was added to enhance transduction efficacy. Fresh
medium containing 2 μg/ml puromycin, which is lethal to
most lentivirus-untransduced cells, was exchanged every
3–4 days until resistant colonies were identified (Figure 3
Panel A). The knockdown efficiency of CD44 shRNA was
then confirmed by western blot when all cell lines grew
vigorously. These cells lines were coined as OVCAR8CD44
shRNA
, OVCAR8Lentivirus only, and OVCAR8Non-specific shRNA
according to the above-mentioned different treatments.

Cell lines and reagents
Ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV-3, OVCAR8,
and multidrug resistance (MDR) ovarian cancer cell
lines SKOV-3TR and OVCAR8TR used in this study
were characterized previously [45–48]. All cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Grand Island,
NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) at 37°C in atmosphere composed of
5% CO2 and 95% air. Human non-specific siRNA and
CD44 targeted endoribonuclease-prepared siRNA
(esiRNA, Genebank Accession Number NM_001001391,
5′-TTAAAGGGATTCCCATCATTGGAATCTTAT-3′)
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
esiRNAs are synthesized by in vitro transcription of a
300–600 bp gene specific dsRNA, followed by enzymatic
digestion using RNAses (i.e., RNase III). esiRNAs are
pools of siRNAs that all target the same mRNA sequence
with high specificity. This strategy eliminates the trial and
error approach of identifying a useful synthetic siRNA and
ensures minimal risk of off-target effects [49]. Therefore,
we selected CD44 targeted esiRNA as transient transfection
tool in this study. Lipofectamine® RNAiMAX was
purchased from Life Technologies Corp. The monoclonal
mouse anti-human CD44 antibody was obtained from Cell
Signaling Technology, which was produced by immunizing
BALB/c mice with stimulated human leukocytes and
recognizes residues surrounding Ser210 of human CD44.
The monoclonal rabbit anti-human Pgp antibody, which
recognizes endogenous levels of total MDR1/ABCB1
protein, was also obtained from Cell Signaling Technology.

Determination of the CD44 knockdown effect
on spheroid formation in 3-Dimensional (3-D)
culture of ovarian cancer cells
Cell spheroid formation was performed following
HDP1096 Perfecta3D® 96-Well Hanging Drop Plates
Protocol (3D Biomatrix). Initially, due to the small
volume of hanging drops, which makes them susceptible
to evaporation and the variability in incubator conditions,
pre-heated agarose solution was filled into the reservoirs
of plate to better maintain the humidity condition
of spheroid culture. Hanging drops were formed by
pipetting 40 μL of cell suspension (2.5 × 105/ml) into
each well, OVCAR8, OVCAR8Lentivirus only, OVCAR8Nonspecific shRNA
, and OVCAR8CD44 shRNA, respectively. 10 μL of
fresh medium was added back into the hanging drops
slowly every other day to provide enough nutrients for
cells and to prevent osmolality shift of the medium.
The spheroids were harvested for further study from the
bottom side of the plate by pipetting 100 μL Phosphate
Buffer Solution (PBS) into each well gently without
any destruction of the morphology of the spheroids.
Finally, the spheroids were photographed on a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-U inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon
Instruments, Inc NY, CA) after incubating with 1 μM
Calcein AM (Life Technologies) for 15 min. The size of
tumor spheroids was computed based on image analysis
(by the software ImageJ).

Proliferation ability and cytotoxicity of anticancer
drug paclitaxel in ovarian cancer cells were assessed by
MTT (3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium
bromide) assay after CD44 was knocked down by CD44
shRNA. Well-established cells (OVCAR8Lentivirus only,
OVCAR8Non-specific shRNA, as well as OVCAR8CD44 shRNA) were
seeded into 96-well microplate at the density of 1 × 103
cells per well and exposed to different concentrations of
paclitaxel which were obtained from the pharmacy at the
Massachusetts General Hospital. After 7-day incubation
with a series concentrations of paclitaxel, 20 μL MTT
(Sigma-Aldrich) was added and then incubated for another
4 hours at 37°C and 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere.
Subsequently, the resulting intracellular formazan crystals
was solubilized in acid-isopropanol. The absorbances were
assessed on a SpectraMax Microplate® Spectrophotometer
(Molecular Devices LLC, Sunnyvale, CA) at 490 nm, and
normalized to the value of untreated cells.

Wound healing assay
The effect of CD44 knockdown in ovarian cancer
cells on migration was evaluated by wound healing
assay. In brief, 2 × 105 cells were seeded onto a 12-well
plate, and transfected with CD44 esiRNA or non-specific
siRNA. When the cells reached 80–100% confluence,
three parallel lines with similar width were then created
in each well using sterile 200 μL pipette tips and rinsed to
clear cell debris and suspension cells. Fresh regular RPMI
1640 medium was added and the cells were allowed to
close the wound for 24 hours. Three images were captured
per well at different time points after wounding (0, 8 and
24 hours) to monitor the repair process by a microscope
(Nikon) at 100× magnification. The width of the wound
was measured at 10 sites in each image. The cell migration
distance was calculated by subtracting the wound width at
each time point from the wound width at the 0 hour.

Western blot

Matrigel invasion assay

Protein lysates of the cells and tissues were
extracted with 1 × RIPA lysis buffer (Upstate
Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) plus complete
protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche Applied
Science, IN, USA). The protein concentrations were
evaluated using Protein Assay Reagents (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, USA) and a SPECTRAmax Microplate
Spectrophotometer from Molecular Devices (Sunnyvale).
Equal amounts of proteins were separated by NuPAGE®
4–12% Bis-Tris Gel (Life Technologies), transferred onto
nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad), and incubated with
specific primary antibodies (CD44 at 1 : 1000 dilutions;
Pgp at 1 : 1000 dilutions; β-Actin at 1 : 2000 dilutions) at
4°C overnight. The membranes were further probed with
respective secondary antibodies (LI-COR Bioscences,
Lincoln, NE), and scanned by Odyssey® CLx equipment
(LI-COR Bioscences) to detect the bands. Furthermore,
the density of the bands was quantified by Odyssey
software 3.0 (LI-COR Bioscences).

Matrigel invasion assay examined the alteration of
cell invasion activity using a BD BioCoatTM MatrigelTM
Invasion Chamber (Becton-Dickinson, MA) following the
manufacturer’s recommendations. Specifically, 5 × 104
cells were added into the upper chamber of each well in
FBS-free and antibiotics-free medium, and transfected
with CD44 esiRNA or non-specific siRNA in the same
transfection protocol as mentioned above, while the
bottom chambers were filled with 500 μL medium with
10% FBS without antibiotics. After a 48-hour incubation
period, the non-invading cells were carefully scrubbed
from the upper surface of the membrane with a cotton
swab. Following the processes of fixation in 100%
methanol and staining in hematoxylin, the invading cells
were counted in three images of each membrane under a
microscope using a 200× objective.

Statistic analysis
The data were analyzed using Prism 5.0 software
(Graph Pad Software Inc., San Diego, CA), and expressed
as mean ± SEM. Statistical significance was assessed using
independent two-tailed Student t-tests for independent
data. Disease free survival and overall survival were
analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves with GehanBreslow-Wilcoxon test for significance. Differences of
P < 0.05 were considered significant for all statistical tests.

Immunofluorescence
Immunofluorescence assay was utilized for
visualizing the post transfection expression levels of CD44
in ovarian cancer cells. Firstly, the 48-hour post transfection
cells were incubated in 4% paraformaldehyde, fixed in icecold methanol, and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin
(BSA). Then, immunostaining was performed using the
CD44 antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 (Red) conjugated goat
anti-mouse antibody (Life Technologies), and 1 μg/ml
Hoechst 33342 (Life Technologies) for counterstaining of
nuclei. Finally, the cells were photographed on a Nikon
Eclipse Ti-U fluorescence microscope (Nikon Instruments,
Inc NY, CA) equipped with a SPOT RTTM digital camera.
