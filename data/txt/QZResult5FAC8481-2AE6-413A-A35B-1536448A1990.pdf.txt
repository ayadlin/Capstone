Inhibition of the chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) induces apoptosis, and it is a promising anti-cancer strategy. The
mechanisms underpinning apoptosis activation following HSP90 inhibition and how they are modiﬁed during acquired drug
resistance are unknown. We show for the ﬁrst time that, to induce apoptosis, HSP90 inhibition requires the cooperation of multi
BH3-only proteins (BID, BIK, PUMA) and the reciprocal suppression of the pro-survival BCL-2 family member MCL1, which occurs via
inhibition of STAT5A. A subset of tumour cell lines exhibit dependence on MCL1 expression for survival and this dependence is also
associated with tumour response to HSP90 inhibition. In the acquired resistance setting, MCL1 suppression in response to HSP90
inhibitors is maintained; however, a switch in MCL1 dependence occurs. This can be exploited by the BH3 peptidomimetic ABT737,
through non-BCL-2-dependent synthetic lethality.

INTRODUCTION
Targeting the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90)
is an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating cancer. HSP90 is
essential for the maturation of client proteins, and its inhibition
leads to client misfolding, ubiquitination and proteasomal
degradation.1 Consequently, HSP90 inhibition is pleiotropic in its
targeting, effectively inhibiting cancer networks.2–5 The mechanisms underpinning resistance are poorly understood. HSP90
inhibition efﬁciently induces cancer cell apoptosis and may be
selective to chaperone-dependent oncogenic drivers such as
EML4-ALK.6 Different variants of the EML4-ALK fusion protein
exhibit different stability and sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition7 and
our recent data suggest that speciﬁc EML4-ALK variants exhibit
differential sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition-mediated ubiquitination
and degradation, owing to their TAPE domain structure.8
Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligase Cullin-5 has an important role in
mediating the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG-induced degradation of
driver oncogenes that are HSP90 clients. Suppression of Cullin-5
has been proposed as a mechanism of acquired resistance in
epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant tumours.9 The alteration
of the expression of other heat-shock proteins, such as HSP70 and
HSP27, is an intrinsic mechanism of resistance that can occur as a
result of a compensatory response to protect cancer cells from
stress insults.10,11 Rapid drug metabolism has also been correlated
to a reduction of the response to HSP90 inhibitors. UGT1A (UDP
glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A complex locus)
levels have been proposed as a predictive biomarker for response
to resorcinolic HSP90 inhibitors,12,13 whereas a reduced expression
of NQO1 (NAD(P)H dehydrogenase quinone 1) has been shown
to mediate resistance to 17-AAG and other geldanamycin
analogues.14 Resistance to HSP90 inhibition has been associated
with point mutations in the N-domain of Humicola fuscoatra and

S. hygroscopicus. However, in eukaryotic cells a mutation in the
ATP-binding site of HSP90 would be incompatible with the
survival of the cell.15 The hyper activation of survival pathways
and alteration of the apoptotic response16 have been shown to
have an important role in drug resistance.
The mode of activation of apoptosis following HSP90 inhibition
is poorly deﬁned. The canonical mitochondrial apoptosis pathway
is induced by the multidomain proapoptotic BCL-2 family
members BAX and BAK,17 which control mitochondrial outer
membrane permeabilization (MOMP).18,19 MOMP is governed by
the interplay of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, which
interact with BAX and BAK to prevent oligomerization and MOMP,
and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins, which can trigger
apoptosis by direct or indirect interaction with BAX and
BAK.20,21 These sentinels also couple the mitochondrial apoptosis
pathway to damage in distinct cellular compartments.22,23
BAX has been shown to be required for induction of cell death by
17-AAG in human colon carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo;24 however,
the complement of essential BH3-only proteins is poorly characterized.
Using functional genetics, we have dissected the BCL-2 family
members required for activation of mitochondrial apoptosis. MCL1
downregulation persists in the acquired resistance setting, albeit
in the context of a switch in MCL1 dependence. This allows
pharmacological exploitation to revert the HSP90 inhibitorresistant phenotype via combination with a BH3-peptidomimetic.

RESULTS
Apoptosis induced by inhibition of HSP90 requires the
mitochondrial pathway
Resistance to HSP90 inhibition was observed in mouse embryonic
ﬁbroblasts harbouring homozygous deletion of BAX and BAK

(DKOBAX/BAK), compared with wild-type (WT) cells (Figures 1a and b,
Supplementary Figure S1A and B). Re-expression of exogenous
BAX in DKOBAX/BAK cells restored sensitivity (Figure 1c). Both
stable25 and transient silencing of BAX and/or BAK rescued cells
from HSP90 inhibition-induced apoptosis (Figures 1d and e,
Supplementary Figure S1C and D), providing evidence for
apoptosis induction via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway.
Caspase 8 activation occurred in a BAX/BAK-dependent manner,
further implicating an ampliﬁcation loop via the mitochondria
(Supplementary Figure S1E).
We utilized a focused siRNA panel to identify the complement
of critical proapoptotic BH3-only proteins required for HSP90
inhibitor-induced apoptosis. Silencing of the activating BH3-only
protein BID26 and pro-survival BCL-2 family inhibitor BIK21
signiﬁcantly inhibited caspase 3 activation in all the cell lines
analysed. PUMA induction was required for apoptosis in
MSTO-211H and H23 cells only (Figure 1f, Supplementary
Figure S2A–C). The activating BH3-only protein BIM,21 previously
reported to be a critical mediator of HSP90 inhibitioninduced apoptosis,27 was not found to be required (Supplementary
Figure S2D).
The effect of silencing BID, BIK and PUMA on the response to
ganetespib was conﬁrmed with additional siRNA sequences
(Supplementary Figure S2E).

HSP90 inhibition transcriptionally suppresses MCL1 via STAT5A
inhibition
To determine whether HSP90 inhibition modiﬁes the expression of
pro-survival BCL-2 family proteins to promote apoptosis, we
examined the expression of BCL-2, BCL-xL, BCL-w, MCL1 and
BCL2A1 pre- and post-HSP90 inhibition, and identiﬁed MCL1
downregulation as the sole modiﬁcation across this pro-survival
protein repertoire (Figure 2a, Supplementary Figure S3A).
Caspase-dependent cleavage of MCL1 did not account for its
downregulation (Supplementary Figure S3B), and MCL1 mRNA
levels were reduced following HSP90 inhibition as evidenced by
qPCR and MCL1 promoter activity (Figures 2b and c). To identify
possible MCL1-associated transcription factors, we generated
three truncation mutants of the promoter region in the MCL1
luciferase reporter, called A, B and C (Supplementary Figure S3C).
The shorter truncation mutants (A and B) were responsible for
lower luciferase reporter activity, with the smallest fragment C
having an activity similar to the empty vector (Figure 2d).
Using PROMO prediction software to identify putative transcription factor binding sites, a binding site for the HSP90 client STAT5A
was predicted in a region present in fragments A and B but not C.
A binding site for the HSP90 client p53 was also predicted but in
multiple regions across the full-length promoter sequence.
We studied the effect of the silencing of both STAT5A
(Supplementary Figure S3D) and p53 (Supplementary Figure S3E)

in MSTO-211H and NCI-H28. RNAi silencing of STAT5A resulted in a
signiﬁcant reduction of MCL1 mRNA levels and MCL1 promoter
activity in MSTO-211H cells as well as NCI-H28 cells, whereas p53
RNAi had no effect. (Figure 2e, Supplementary Figure S4A). The
extent of the effect obtained with silencing of STAT5A was
comparable to that achieved with ganetespib in MSTO-211H. In
contrast, no effect on MCL1 expression or promoter activity was
observed in NCI-H28 cells following treatment with ganetespib.
We therefore hypothesized a lack of activity of the drug in
inhibiting the interaction between HSP90 and STAT5, in NCI-H28

cells. Indeed, the treatment inhibited STAT5 in MSTO-211H, but
not in NCI-H28 cells (Figure 2f).
Sensitivity to HSP90 inhibition correlates with MCL1 dependence
HSP90 inhibitor-induced MCL1 downregulation correlated with
sensitivity in a panel of nine mesothelioma and seven lung
adenocarcinoma cell lines (Figure 3a, Supplementary Figure S4A).
This association was also observed in live primary mesothelioma
explants obtained at radical surgery (Figure 3b).

MCL1 silencing by RNA interference was sufﬁcient to induce
apoptosis (Figure 3c, Supplementary Figure S4B), implicating
dependence to this pro-survival BCL-2 family protein. MCL1
silencing was conducted in thirteen additional cell lines
(Supplementary Figure S4C) and two groups have been generated
according to MCL1 addiction. MCL1-dependent cell lines were
more sensitive to HSP90 inhibition (Figure 3d). To demonstrate
that MCL1 downregulation following HSP90 inhibition correlates
with MCL1 addiction, we used contingency analysis (P = 0.0256)
(Table 1). To establish whether MCL1 silencing induced cell death
via the same repertoire of BH3-only proteins as HSP90 inhibition,
we conducted a BH3-only protein focused RNAi screening and
identiﬁed BIK and PUMA as essential. Apoptosis occurred in a
caspase 8-independent manner (Supplementary Figure S5A–C).
Ganetespib-resistant cells lose MCL1 dependence
We then hypothesized that MCL1 suppression would itself be a
selection pressure for acquired resistance leading to loss of either
MCL1 downregulation or MCL1 dependence. We therefore
generated MSTO-211H cells with greater than 1-logfold IC50
associated resistance to ganetespib (STAR) compared with

isogenic parental cells, as evidenced by loss of viability and
clonogenic assay (Figure 4a, Supplementary Figure S6A). Resistance was generalized to multiple HSP90 inhibitors, and these cells
exhibited cross resistance to the endoplasmic reticulum stress
inducer tunicamycin (Supplementary Figure S6B and C).
HSP90 inhibition still induced downregulation of MCL1 to the
same extent in resistant compared with parental cells, as well as
dephosphorylation of AKT and ERK (Figure 4b). Resistance was
associated with a block in MOMP evidenced by a lack of
cytochrome-c release (Figure 4c), and a lack of BAX/BAKdependent caspase 8 activation (Supplementary Figure S6D).
Although MCL1 downregulation occurred following HSP90 inhibition, the dependence of parental cells on this pro-survival protein
changed such that MCL1 RNAi was no longer able to induce
apoptosis alone (Figure 4d).
Genome-wide screen for copy number alterations revealed
large structural variations throughout the genome; however, no
speciﬁc selection for alterations in the loci encoding BCL-2 prosurvival genes was observed (Supplementary Figure S6E).
Reversal of ganetespib resistance via concurrent pro-survival
BCL-2 family inhibition
MCL1 has been reported to mediate resistance to the BCL-2, BCLxL, BCL-w inhibitor, ABT737 and this resistance can be reversed by
suppression of MCL1.28 We therefore hypothesized that in the
acquired resistance setting, conserved transcriptional suppression
of MCL1 might be exploited to sensitize to ABT737. Accordingly, a
combination of ABT737 and ganetespib led to induction of cell
death as shown by PARP cleavage, and signiﬁcant reduction in
colony formation (Figure 5a). This effect was also observed in vivo
(Figure 5b). BCL-2 inhibition alone was insufﬁcient to mediate this
effect as evidenced by resistance to the combination of
ganetespib with the BCL-2-speciﬁc inhibitor ABT199 (Figure 5c).
Using BH3-only protein focused RNAi, we observed that
apoptosis induced by ABT737 and ganetespib in resistant cells

of the study. The combination of ABT263 with ganetespib resulted in a statistically signiﬁcant decrease in tumour volume compared with
vehicle control (error bars ± s.e.m.). (2-way Anova repeated measurements results: 19 days, ABT 263 + Ganetespib vs Vehicle, **P=0.0095;

required BAX/BAK and BID/PUMA (Figure 5d). MCL1 RNAi
phenocopied ganetespib by inducing apoptosis when combined
with ABT737 (Figure 5e). To corroborate these data, we performed
a rescue experiment transfecting MCL1. The overexpression of
MCL1 partially reduced the effect of the combination of
ganetespib and ABT737 (Supplementary Figure S7A), with greater
impact when RNAi targeting the 3’ untranslated region of
endogenous MCL1 was combined with ABT737 (Supplementary
Figure S7B).
We then studied the effect of the combination treatment in the
context of intrinsic resistance to examine whether ABT737 might
also potentiate HSP90 inhibition induced apoptosis. MCL1 was not
downregulated in NCI-H28 cells after treatment (Supplementary
Figure S4A) and these cells were not addicted to MCL1
(Supplementary Figure S4B). Accordingly, combination with
ABT737 did not reverse HSP90 inhibitor resistance (Figure 5f);
however, treatment with ABT737 or ganetespib following MCL1
silencing did induce cell death (Figure 5g), conﬁrming that MCL1
downregulation is necessary to activate apoptosis in this HSP90
inhibitor resistant setting.
DISCUSSION
Apoptosis block is a hallmark of cancer and may contribute to the
onset of drug resistance.29 We have shown that apoptosis induced
by inhibition of HSP90 involves the mitochondrial pathway and is
activated by the reciprocal regulation of speciﬁc pro-apoptotic
and anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. We have found that up
to three BH3-only proteins (BID, BIK and PUMA) act in a
coordinated manner, to trigger BAX/BAK-dependent cell death
(Figure 6). This contrasts with single BH3-only protein dependence
in the targeting of epidermal growth factor receptor, where BIM
alone is required to induce cell death.30–32 This implies that the
HSP90 inhibitor simultaneously damages multiple cell compartments leading to activation of p53-dependent PUMA

Figure 6. Schematic representation of the HSP90 inhibition-induced
apoptosis in sensitive cells and in the context of acquired resistance.
In sensitive cells, HSP90 inhibition targets the BH3-only proteins BID,
BIK and PUMA and the pro-survival BCL-2 family protein MCL1
(white boxes). HSP90 inhibition requires complex interplay of these
proteins to mediate BAX/BAK-dependent apoptosis. In resistant
cells, MCL1 repression is conserved, however, BIK is not essential. To
achieve apoptosis both the activation of BID and PUMA by HSP90
inhibition, and the targeting of the pro-survival proteins BCL-xL and
BCL-w by ABT737, are needed.

transcription,33 BIK that signals to the endoplasmic reticulum23
and BID, which is activated by caspase 8 cleavage.34
We observed a requirement of BAX and BAK to mediate cell
death in response to HSP90 inhibition, with a signiﬁcantly reduced
response in BAX- or BAK-negative models. This is in accordance
with recent data showing that BAX is required for the induction of
cell death after treatment with the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG.24 In
the absence of BAX and BAK, caspase 8 cleavage was not
observed in response to HSP90 inhibition, suggesting that cell
death is mediated via the intrinsic pathway and caspase 8 is
activated only as the result of a mitochondrial ampliﬁcation loop.
A signiﬁcant decrease in MCL1 expression was observed after
treatment with HSP90 inhibitors in vitro and in explants from
mesothelioma and this correlated with sensitivity to ganetespib.
Focal ampliﬁcation of MCL1 (1q21.2) has been reported as one of
the most frequent copy number variation across human cancers
and this correlates with addiction to MCL1 in vitro.35 We found
that MCL1 dependence is associated with higher sensitivity to
HSP90 inhibition, suggesting that a possible correlation with 1q21
ampliﬁcation could be predictive for HSP90 inhibitors.
MCL1 has a short half-life of 30 min36 and can be rapidly
regulated at transcriptional,37 post-transcriptional38 and posttranslational levels.39 A conserved STAT5A binding site has been
identiﬁed in both the promoter region and the 3’ untranslated
region of Mcl1 in mice natural killer cells.40 We have shown for the
ﬁrst time that HSP90 inhibition reduces MCL1 luciferase reporter
activity and mRNA expression, through interference with STAT5Adependent activity. These ﬁndings are consistent with the
previous reports in which inhibition of STAT3/5 can downregulate
MCL1 and can induce apoptosis in response to tyrosine kinase
inhibition.41,42 We observed a failure to downregulate MCL1 in
HSP90 inhibitor-resistant NCI-H28 cells and this was associated
with failure to target STAT5 by an unknown mechanism.
In the acquired resistant context, MCL1 downregulation
persisted alongside other markers of HSP90 inhibition, including
inhibition of AKT and MAPK signaling. This suggested that
selection did not involve loss of on-target activity, but rather,
resistance occurred downstream of the HSP90-client interaction at
the level of the cell death machinery. ABT-737 inhibits BCL-xL,
BCL-w and BCL-2 and its apoptosis inducing efﬁcacy is prevented
by MCL1.43 As HSP90 inhibitor-resistant cells conserved MCL1
downregulation, we found that apoptosis could be re-activated by
combining the HSP90 inhibitor with sub-lethal concentrations of
ABT737. The apoptotic mechanism for this synergistic interaction
utilized the same BH3-only proteins (BIK and PUMA) as for the
HSP90 inhibitor alone in the parental cells; however in this
context, the BH3-only protein BIK became redundant (Figure 6).
Although a combination of MCL1 RNAi and ABT737 or ganetespib
could induce apoptosis in intrinsically resistant NCI-H28 cells, this
was not observed following HSP90 inhibitor plus ABT737, implying
an MCL1-dependent mechanism. NCI-H28 cells had a block of
MCL1 downregulation secondary to the lack of effect of HSP90
inhibition on STAT5A.
We have chosen to focus on thoracic cancer models as these
are presently the focus of our ongoing trials. It is possible that the
link shown between MCL1 and HSP90 inhibition can be more
widely generalized, but this will require future studies to conﬁrm.
Results from the Phase IIB Galaxy1 trial in patients with metastatic
lung adenocarcinoma, comparing the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib
and docetaxel with docetaxel alone, has shown that patients
refractory to standard chemotherapy ( o6 months) do not beneﬁt
from the combination treatment with ganetespib plus docetaxel
(NCT01348126).44 Consistent with this, we observed that
chemotherapy-resistant cell lines selected in vitro for cisplatin45
and vinorelbine46 exhibited cross resistance to HSP90 inhibition
with loss of MCL1 dependence (Supplementary Figure S8).
In summary, even in the acquired resistance context, HSP90
inhibitors persist in downregulating MCL1 and can switch MCL1

with 1 μg of a GFP-tagged BAX construct or GFP empty vector, using
Xtreme gene transfection reagent (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR
Cell lines
Mesothelioma cell lines: ONE58, JU77, H2591 and H2461 were kindly
provided by Dr PW Szlosarek, Institute of Cancer at Barts, London, UK);
MM98 was kindly provided by Dr S Biffo, San Raffaele Scientiﬁc Institute,
Milan, Italy). NCI-2452, NCI-2052, NCI-H28 and MSTO-211H were purchased
from ATCC (Middlesex, UK). NSCLC cell lines: H460, H23, H1299, H1975 and
NCI-H727 were purchased from ATCC; NCI-3122 was obtained from the NCI
Tumour Repository. WT and BAX/BAK double knockout (DKOBAX/BAK)
mouse embryonic ﬁbroblasts were a kind gift from Dr Scott Oakes,
University of California, San Francisco, USA). All cells lines were grown in
RPMI Medium 1640, L-Glutamine and 10% FBS. Ganetespib-resistant
MSTO-211H was generated by increasing exposure to ganetespib in a
stepwise manner over duration of 8 months. Cells were incubated with
200 nM ganetespib for 72 h and then washed. Surviving cells were allowed
to grow to conﬂuence and then treated with increasing concentrations of
ganetespib up to 2 μM.

Measurement of cell viability and apoptosis
In all, 5000 cells per well were seeded in 96-well plate and incubated for
72 h in the presence or absence of HSP90i at concentrations ranging from
20 nM to 2 μM. Cell viability was assessed by MTT (Sigma) assay. For the
Caspase 3 luminescence assay, cells were left untreated or incubated with
200 nM ganetespib. Forty-eight hours following treatment, cells were
analysed using the Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay protocol (Promega,
Southampton, UK).

Protein extraction and immunoblotting
Forty-eight hours after treatment cells were lysed in RIPA buffer containing
protease inhibitors (Roche, Burgess Hill UK) and whole-cell lysates were
clariﬁed by centrifugation. In all, 40 μg of total cell lysates was loaded and
separated on SDS-PAGE denaturing gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes, and blocked in 5% milk-PBS-0.1% Tween. Membranes were
probed with primary antibodies diluted in 5% milk-PBS-0.1% Tween-20 at
4 °C overnight. Signal detection was performed with ECL-plus chemiluminescent system (GE Healthcare).

Flow cytometry
Samples were analysed on a BD FACS Calibur ﬂow cytometer machine,
using Cell Quest Pro software (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, UK). Cell death
was determined after 48 h of treatment with ganetespib 200 nM by using
propidium iodide (Sigma) staining to evaluate the percentage of cells with
sub-diploidal DNA content.

Total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed with
High Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA).
Real-time PCR was carried out using Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix
(Applied Biosystem) after 24 h of silencing or 48 h of treatment. QuantiTect
primer assays (Qiagen) were used for MCL1 and Actin.

MCL1 promoter sub-cloning
The full-length MCL1 promoter (352 bp)47 and the pGL2 basic empty
vector were kindly donated by Prof. El-Tanani (Centre for Cancer Research
and Cell Biology, Queens University Belfast, Belfast, UK). Three fragments of
277 bp, 193 bp and 115 bp have been generated by PCR and directional
cloning with XhoI and HindIII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA)
restriction sites. PROMO analysis48 was carried out on the three fragments
to identify putative transcription factors binding sites.

Reporter assay
Cells were transfected with pGL2 basic or pGL2-MCL1 and Renilla by using
the Xtreme gene transfection reagent (Roche) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. At time of transfections, cells had also been
treated with HSP90i. Twenty-four hours after transfection cells were lysed
and stored at − 80 °C for at least 24 h. The luciferase activity was then
measured by a Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase
activity was normalized to Renilla activity.

Explants
Primary pleural tissue was sectioned into small fragments (~64 mm3).
Tissue explants were cultured in DMEM, 2% fetal calf serum, Penicillin
Streptomycin, 2 mM Glutamax, allowed to recover overnight and then
treated for 24 h with ganetespib 2 μM. In all, 5-μm sections were used for
immunohistochemistry, as previously described.49 Primary antibodies were
diluted in 1% goat serum/0.1% BSA/PBS (Cleaved Caspase 3, Cell Signaling,
1:200; MCL1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 1:150). The Rabbit-speciﬁc HRP/
DAB (ABC) Detection IHC Kit (Abcam) has been used for the immunohistochemistry, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sections were
counterstained with haematoxylin and mounted using Vectamount
permanent mounting media (Vector Labs, Peterborough, UK). Images
were taken at × 40 magniﬁcation on a Hamamatsu Nanozoomer Digital
slide scanner (Hamamatsu, Welwyn Garder City, UK). Appropriate ethical
approval was obtained from the local research ethics committee to carry
out this work.

Scoring
For MCL1 as all cells stained evenly, only the intensity of the staining was
measured on a scale 1–4. Cleaved Caspase 3 reﬂecting cell death events
was scored as percentage of cells with cytoplasmic staining.

Xenografts
Female CB.17 (SCID) mice (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA,
USA) at 7–12 weeks of age were maintained in a pathogen-free
environment and all in vivo procedures were performed in strict

accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals
and approved by the Synta Pharmaceuticals Corp. Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee. STAR cells were cultured as described and
subcutaneously implanted into SCID mice at 5 × 106 cells per animal
following suspension in 50% matrigel (BD Biosciences, Oxford, UK). Mice
bearing established tumours were allocated into treatment groups of
seven exhibiting similar average tumour volumes (150 mm3) and dosed
intravenously with vehicle (DRD; 10% dimethyl sulphoxide, 18% Cremophor RH 40, 3.6% dextrose) or ganetespib, or orally with ABT263, using the
doses and schedules indicated. Ganetespib was formulated in DRD;
ABT263 in PEG400/Ethanol/Phenthol as previously described.50 Tumour
volumes (V) were calculated by caliper measurements of the width (W),
length (L) and thickness (T) of each tumour using the formula: V = 0.5236
(LWT). Statistical analyses between the groups at end point were
conducted using two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements (GraphPad Prism).

Cytochrome-c release
Cells were treated with ganetespib 200 nM for 48 h and incubated in lysis
buffer containing digitonin (Sigma) 0.0125% for 10 min, as previously
described.51

Oncoscan analysis
DNA was extracted with the QIAmp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). In all, 80 ng of
gDNA was analysed using the OncoScan FFPE Assay Kit (Affymetrix,
Wooburn Green High Wycombe, UK). Nexus Express Software for
OncoScan 3.0.1 (Biodiscovery, Hawthorne, CA, UK) was used to carry out
the analysis. Sample 1 was re-centred using the following region:
chr1:64884261–113254220, chr6:99510013–147879973, chr7:65852764–
159138663, chr12:75057068–123427028, chr14:37220996–85590956,
chr17:662565–6708810 and chr19:51831082–57877327. Sample 2 was
re-centred using the following regions: chr1:56680628–105050588,
chr3:102941721–108987966, chr7:70656908–82749398, chr14:63600510–
87785490, chr18:37427358–61612338

Statistical analysis
Dose–response curves were ﬁtted using non-linear regression (GraphPad
Prism version 6.0, GraphPad Software, LaJolla, CA, USA). All data are
representative of the median of three independent experiments. To
determine correlation between sensitivity and MCL1 downregulation,
MCL1 addiction we used the Mann–Wittney test. The Wilcoxon test was
performed on all immunohistochemistry data. The Fisher’s exact test has
been used to analyse the contingency table data. The signiﬁcance of the
other data has been assessed with t-test or one-way ANOVA. All P-values
less than 0.05 were considered as signiﬁcant.
