Abstract
Transcription factors play a central role in malignant
transformation by activating or repressing waves of downstream target genes. Therapeutic targeting of transcription
factors can reprogram cancer cells to lose their advantages in
growth and survival. The BCL6 transcriptional repressor plays
a central role in the pathogenesis of diffuse large B-cell
lymphomas (DLBCL) and controls downstream checkpoints,
including the p53 tumor suppressor gene. We report that a
specific inhibitor of BCL6 called BPI can trigger a p53
response in DLBCL cells. This was partially due to induction
of p53 activity and partially due to relief of direct repression
by BCL6 of p53 target genes. BPI could thus induce a p53-like
response even in the presence of mutant p53. Moreover,
sequential BCL6 peptide inhibitors followed by p53 peptide
or small-molecule activators provided a more powerful
antilymphoma effect than either treatment alone by maximally restoring p53 target gene expression. Therefore, tandem
targeting of the overlapping BCL6 and p53 transcriptional
programs can correct aberrant survival pathways in DLBCL
and might provide an effective therapeutic approach to
lymphoma therapy. [Cancer Res 2008;68(9):3361–9]

Introduction
Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) are the most common
type of B-cell lymphomas. The BCL6 (B-cell lymphoma 6) protooncogene is frequently constitutively expressed in DLBCL due to
translocation of heterologous promoters to the BCL6 coding
region, or point mutations of negative regulatory elements due to
misdirected somatic hypermutation (1). Constitutive expression of
BCL6 in mouse models that mimic human BCL6 translocations can
induce formation of DLBCL (2, 3). Many DLBCLs express BCL6
even in the absence of genetic lesions, suggesting that other factors
that drive BCL6 expression could also be oncogenic hits. The
lymphomagenic effects of BCL6 may be related to its ability to
directly repress critical cell cycle checkpoint genes, including TP53
(tumor protein p53), ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related),
CHEK1 (CHK1 checkpoint homologue), and p21CDKN1A [cyclindependent kinase inhibitor 1A (p21, Cip1); refs. 4–7]. DLBCL cells
become dependent on BCL6 because its continued presence is

required to maintain proliferation and survival of DLBCL cells
(6, 8).
BCL6 is a transcriptional repressor and member of the BTB/POZ
(bric à brac-tramtrack-broad complex/pox virus zinc finger) family
of proteins. The BCL6 BTB domain plays a key role in repression by
recruiting the SMRT (silencing mediator of retinoid and thyroid
receptors), N-CoR (nuclear receptor corepressor), and BCoR
(BCL6 corepressor) corepressors (9, 10). These three corepressors
can bind to a groove located on the surface of BCL6 BTB
homodimers (11). We designed a BCL6 peptide inhibitor (BPI),
which mimics the 18-amino-acid region of SMRT that binds to
BCL6. BPI readily penetrates DLBCL cells and blocks BCL6 from
recruiting N-CoR, SMRT, and BCoR, resulting in chromatin
remodeling and reactivation of BCL6 target genes (8). BPI
specifically inhibited BCL6 and not other transcriptional repressor
proteins (8). BPI specifically killed DLBCL cells that express BCL6
but had no effect on BCL6-negative DLBCL cells (6–8, 12). Finally,
BPI abrogated the biological activity of BCL6 on B-cells in vivo,
demonstrating that effective levels of this inhibitor can be readily
achieved in an animal model (8).
Targeting of oncogenic transcription factors like BCL6 is a
feasible strategy for cancer therapy (13, 14). However, a single
targeted agent is unlikely to be curative because tumors typically
contain multiple oncogenic ‘‘hits.’’ One way to overcome this
obstacle is to combine a transcription therapy agent with
chemotherapy drugs, as routinely used in the treatment of acute
promyelocytic leukemia (15). We propose another more specific
route toward enhancing the activity of specific transcription
therapy agents. In particular, we hypothesized that it is possible
to enhance antitumor effects by combining agents that target
successive waves of transcriptional programming. In the case of
BCL6, an attractive downstream network for therapeutic targeting
is that of the p53 tumor suppressor, which regulates genes involved
in cell death and proliferation (16). Restoration of defective p53
function could potentially facilitate induction of cell death and
growth arrest in tumor cells. Recent studies carried out in
lymphoma and other tumor cells showed that p53 function could
be enhanced or restored by specific peptides or small molecules,
which rescue certain types of mutant as well as wild-type (WT) p53
proteins (reviewed in ref. 17). Herein, we show that BPI can induce
p53 expression and biological functions in DLBCL cells, including
those with certain p53 mutations. These effects were due both to
induction of TP53 and to loss of BCL6 repression on p53 target
genes. Sequential administration of BPI followed by a p53activating peptide or a small molecule cooperatively enhanced
p53 activity and killed DLBCL cells. p53 and BCL6 are thus
intricately functionally linked in DLBCL and can be therapeutically
harnessed as a form of tandem transcription therapy with potent
antilymphoma activity.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines, peptides, and drugs. The DLBCL cell lines Ly1, Ly4, and
Ly10 were grown in Iscove’s medium with 10% FCS and penicillin G/
streptomycin. The Farage, Ly3, SU-DHL6, and SU-DHL4 cell lines were
grown in RPMI with 10% FCS, penicillin G/streptomycin, glutamine, and
HEPES. p53C¶-TAT (GSRAHSSHLKSKKGQSTSRHKKGYGRKKRRQRRR),
p53-control peptide (CP2; GSRAHSSHLESAEGQSTSRHKKGYGRKKRRQRRR; ref. 18), BPI (YGRKKRRQRRRGGRSIHEIPR), and control peptide
(CP; YGRKKRRQRRRG) were obtained from Biosynthesis, Inc. The purity
determined by high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry was 98% or higher for each peptide. Unless noted, peptides were used
at the following concentrations: BPI and CP 5 Amol/L five times per day,
and p53C¶-TAT and CP2 10 Amol/L once per day. The P53-DN-(His)6-pTATHA (18) was expressed in Escherichia coli cells BL21 (D3; EMD Biosciences,
Inc.) and affinity purified by Ni-NTA Hi-Trap column (APBiotech) using
an AKTA Purifier 10 (APBiotech). Cyclic-pifithrin-a [2-(4-methylphenyl)imidazo[2,1-b ]-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrobenzothiazole; EMD Biosciences, Inc.]
was resuspended in DMSO immediately before use. For combination
experiments, pifithrin-a 20 Amol/L (or DMSO) was added 12 h before
the BPI or CP and every 12 h thereafter until analysis. PRIMA-1 [2,2bis(hydroxymethyl)-1-azabicyclo(2,2,2)octan-3-one] was obtained from
Tocris Cookson, Inc.
Growth inhibition determination. Ly1, Ly3, Ly4, Ly10, SU-DHL4,
SU-DHL6, and Farage cells were grown at concentrations to maintain
exponential growth over the 48 h drug/peptide exposure time. We
determined cell viability using a MTS tetrazolium-based method (Cell Titer
96 Aqueous One, Promega Corp.) and a Polarstar Optima microplate reader
(BMG Labtechnologies). We performed six-point standard curves for each
cell line (correlating the number of viable cells by trypan blue with
absorbance). For combination studies, viability was determined using a
fluorometric resazurin reduction method (CellTiter-Blue, Promega Corp.)
and the Polarstar Optima microplate reader. The number of viable cells in
each treated well was calculated by using the linear least-squares regression
of the standard curve. Absorbance or fluorescence was determined for four
replicates per treatment condition or standard. We verified cell viability by
the sulforhodamine B assay (Sigma) with minor modifications for suspended
cells. Experiments were carried out in triplicates and data are represented as
percentage of growth inhibition to respective control. We used the Calcusyn
software (Biosoft) to determine the concentration of peptides and PRIMA-1
that inhibits 50% the growth of cell lines compared with control treated cells
(GI50) and to determine the combination index (CI). For the CI experiments,
cells were treated with BPI at 5, 15, and 25 Amol/L and/or PRIMA-1 at 25, 75,
and 100 Amol/L (1:5 constant ratio). We assume a mutually exclusive effect
for the combination of BPI and PRIMA-1.
Cell cycle analysis. Cells were fixed with a formaldehyde-based fixation
buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), resuspended in permeabilization buffer
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and stained with anti–Ki-67 antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) and 50 AL propidium iodide 1 mg/mL (Sigma) or
7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences) with 20 AL RNase A 10 Ag/mL
(Sigma). Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry in a FACSCalibur
(BD Bioscience) using CellQuest software (BD Bioscience). Detection of
Ki-67–positive cells, combined with simultaneous measurement of DNA
content followed by bivariate analysis, allowed identification of cells in
G0-G1 (low DNA content values, Ki-67 negative), G2-M (DNA twice that of
G0-G1, Ki-67 negative), and S (intermediate DNA content, Ki-67 positive).
ATP determination. ATP levels were determined using the ApoSENSOR
ADP/ATP assay kit (BioVision). Briefly, cells were lysed to free ATP into
medium containing luciferase and luciferin, which produces light in the
presence of ATP. The light emission is proportional to the amount of ATP
present and was measured using the Polarstar Optima microplate reader.
Apoptosis/necrosis determination. To determine the morphologic
features of cell death, we use the differential uptake of acridine orange
(Sigma) and the DNA binding dye ethidium bromide (Sigma; ethidium
bromide/acridine orange; refs. 19, 20). After 24-h incubation with the
respective active and control peptides, cells were gently centrifuged at 4jC
and resuspended in 20 AL of PBS plus 2 AL of a 1:1 mix of 100 Ag/mL of

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

ethidium bromide/acridine orange. Stained cell suspensions (10 AL) were
transferred to a microscope slide and viewed under a fluorescent light
microscope (Axioskop 2, Carl Zeiss AG) with 100, 200, and 400
magnifications. A total of 100 cells were counted in triplicates per treatment
condition.
Caspase-7/3 activity. The activity of caspase-7 and caspase-3 was
determined using the Apo-ONE caspase-3/7 assay (Promega). DLBCL cell
lines were treated for 6 and 18 h with drug/peptides followed by
1-h exposure to the pro-fluorescent Z-DEVD-R110 substrate. Activation of
Z-DEVD-R110 by the activity of caspase-3/7 allows the R110 group to
become intensely fluorescent (Ex499nm/Em521nm), which was measured
using the Polarstar Optima microplate reader in four replicates. Caspase-7/
3 activity was related to the cell number determined by CellTiter-Blue
(Promega) in a multiplex assay.
DNA fragmentation. An ELISA kit (Cell death detection ELISA, Roche
Diagnostics) was used to determine the presence of mononucleosomes and
oligonucleosomes in the cytoplasmic fraction of cell lysates. DLBCL cells
were exposed to BPI and/or p53C¶-TAT and/or control peptides for 24 h.
Following the manufacturer’s instructions, the cell lysates were applied in
triplicates onto an antihistone-coated plate. After saturation of nonspecific
binding with a blocking solution, the remaining immobilized complexes
were incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated anti-DNA antibody. The
amount of peroxidase retained was colorimetrically determined by using
ABTS as substrate (absorbance A 405nm  A 490nm, Polarstar Optima
microplate reader). The enrichment of nucleosomes in the cytoplasm of
treated cells was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the treated
cells with the corresponding control.
Tissue microarrays, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, Annexin
V/propidium iodide staining, Western blotting, quantitative real-time PCR
(qRT-PRC), and TP53 sequencing are provided as Supplementary Data.

Results
BPI induces p53 expression in DLBCL cells. Because BPI can
reactivate BCL6 target genes and kill DLBCL cells (6–8), and p53 is
a BCL6 target gene (4), we wondered whether BPI could induce p53
expression in DLBCL cells. For this analysis, we selected three
representative DLBCL cell lines: Ly1, which expresses BCL6 and has
biallelic point mutations in the p53 DNA-binding region (21–23);
Ly10, which expresses BCL6 and has WT p53 (23); and Ly4, which
expresses little BCL6, is BCL6 independent and has only one allele
of p53 which is inactivated by two mutations (refs. 22, 23; see also
Supplementary Table S1). We examined the kinetics of BPI effects
on p53 mRNA abundance by qRT-PCR over a time course of
48 hours. BPI caused rapid 3.5-fold induction of p53 transcription
in Ly10 (p53 WT) cells, peaking at 6 hours, but had different
kinetics in Ly1 cells, reaching a maximum of 2-fold increase at
24 hours (Fig. 1A). There was no induction of p53 in the BCL6independent Ly4 cell line. p53 mRNA was baseline expressed at
similar levels (ratio to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase,
Ly4: 0.63, Ly1: 0.74, and Ly10: 0.68) in the three cell lines regardless
of mutational status or BCL6 expression. BPI also induced p53
protein levels (Fig. 1B) with a 1.7 peak fold increase in Ly10 cells at
12 hours followed by a decline in protein abundance at 48 hours,
whereas in Ly1 cells the protein steadily accumulated during the
observation time, peaking at 24 hours, possibly because the
mutated protein may not as efficiently induce its own degradation.
In contrast, p53 protein was not increased in Ly4 cells.
BPI induces a p53 response in DLBCL cells. To determine the
functional effect of BPI-mediated induction of p53, we examined
the kinetics of p53 target gene expression in DLBCL cells exposed
to BPI versus control peptide by qRT-PCR. In Ly10 cells, BPI
induced the p53 target genes p21, NOXA, PUMA (p53-up-regulated
modulator of apoptosis), and GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA

damage–inducible 45 a) within 6 to 12 hours and PIG3 (p53
induced gene 3) within 24 hours (Fig. 2A). p21 induction was
slightly biphasic, peaking first at 6 hours and increasing again at
24 hours. Because p21 is also a direct target of BCL6 (5), it is
possible that its induction by BPI was partially independent of
p53. Accordingly, BPI induced p21 in Ly1 (p53 mutant) cells with
a similar biphasic pattern and level of expression (Fig. 2A). In
contrast, PUMA, NOXA, and PIG3 were unaffected by BPI in Ly1
cells. Like p21, GADD45A was also induced in Ly1 cells to a 2-fold
maximum at 24 hours. We wondered whether GADD45A is also a
BCL6 target gene. The GADD45A promoter contains a BCL6
consensus sequence located within a highly conserved region at
500. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays confirmed strong
enrichment of BCL6 to this site (Supplementary Fig. S1). None of
these genes were induced by BPI in Ly4 cells. These results indicate
that BPI can increase p53 transcriptional function in DLBCL cells
and show that the BCL6 and p53 transcriptional programs are at
least partially overlapping.
We next examined DLBCL cells for cell cycle progression
24 hours after BPI exposure (at which point many BPI-treated
cells are still viable). The Ly10 cell line displayed a reproducible
doubling in G2-M phase cells from 8% to 15%, with a corresponding
reduction in S-phase (consistent with biological effects of p53;
ref. 24; Fig. 2B). In contrast, Ly1 cells showed a small but
reproducible increase in the S-phase fraction of cells from 50% to
60% with a corresponding reduction in G2-M (consistent with our
work showing that BCL6 suppresses an ATR-dependent S-phase
checkpoint; ref. 7). Ly4 cells were not affected by BPI. BPI impaired
viability of both the Ly10 and Ly1 DLBCL cells within 48 hours, as
shown in metabolic assays (Fig. 2C). In contrast, Ly4 cell viability
and survival were unaffected. The cellular effects of BPI in DLBCL
cells thus vary with the mutational status of p53.
p53 induction contributes to BPI-mediated cell death. To
determine the contribution of p53 to effects of BPI, we used
pifithrin-a, an inhibitor of p53 (25). We first examined the effect of
pifithrin-a on expression of p21, GADD45A, and PIG3. BPI induced
p21 and GADD45A in a pifithrin-a–independent manner in (p53
mutant) Ly1 cells, consistent with their direct regulation by BCL6,
but not PIG3 (Fig. 3A). In contrast, pifithrin-a markedly impaired

the induction of all three of these genes in p53 WT Ly10 cells,
suggesting that the mechanism controlling expression of these
genes is dependent on whether p53 was WT or mutated (Fig. 3A).
As expected, BPI and pifithrin-a had no effect in Ly4 cells. Pifithrina rescued Ly10 cells from BPI-mediated loss of viability, but had no
such effect on Ly1 cells (Fig. 3B). To confirm the specificity of these
results, we repeated these experiments using a dominant negative
form of p53 delivered by TAT protein transduction, or a mutant
inactive form of p53 as a control (18). Like pifithrin-a, dominant
negative p53 could at least partially overcome the effects of BPI in
Ly10 but had no effect on Ly1 cells (Fig. 3C). Dominant negative
p53 had a mild viability effect in Ly4 cells, the reason for which is
unknown but could be related to interference with gain of function
effects of the mutant p53 variants expressed in these cells. Taken
together, these data suggest that BPI-mediated release of the p53
pathway from BCL6 repression plays an important role in its ability
to kill DLBCL cells with WT p53. Release of p53 targets also
regulated by BCL6 may contribute in part to BPI effects on DLBCL
cells with mutant p53.
BCL6 inhibition plus p53 activation cooperate to kill DLBCL
cells. A TAT-p53 COOH-terminal peptide (p53C¶-TAT) was shown
to enhance the transcriptional activity of WT p53 (18) and to
rescue the activity of certain p53 DNA contact mutants (26),
without significantly increasing the p53 protein levels. We tested
the effect of p53C¶-TAT on p53 target gene expression in DLBCL
cells. In Ly10 cells, p53C¶-TAT induced p21, GADD45A, and PIG3 by
2.5-fold within 6 hours, and PUMA and NOXA at later time points
(Fig. 4A). p53C¶-TAT also induced these target genes in Ly1 cells,
although with generally delayed kinetics (Fig. 4A) but had
negligible activity in Ly4 cells. Consequently, p53C¶-TAT modestly
reduced the number of viable cells in Ly1 (by 16%), Ly10 (by 22%),
and Ly4 cells (by 4%) after 48 hours of exposure compared with
control (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because BPI can induce p53
expression, and considering that the downstream genes induced by
BPI and p53 partially overlap, we asked whether BPI and p53C¶TAT might cooperate in a transcriptional response that could lead
to enhance antilymphoma effects. DLBCL cells were exposed to BPI
to release p53 from BCL6-mediated suppression, followed 24 hours
later by p53C¶-TAT to further induce the transcriptional activity of

p53. We first measured the fold induction of p53 target gene mRNA
transcripts relative to their respective controls. Remarkably, BPI
and p53C¶-TAT mediated supra-additive induction of p21, PUMA,
and NOXA in both Ly10 and Ly1 cells and of PIG3 in Ly1 cells
(Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S3). Induction of GADD45A was
additive in both cell lines. None of the p53 target genes were
additively activated in Ly4 cells. Based on these results, we
wondered whether the combination of BPI and p53C¶-TAT might
also cooperate in killing lymphoma cells. DLBCL cells were exposed
to BPI or control peptide followed 24 hours later by p53C¶-TAT or
its control peptide for another 24 hours. BPI alone mediated 40%
loss of viability in Ly1 cells and 50% loss of viability in Ly10 cells
whereas it had no effect in Ly4 cells. The sequential administration
of p53C¶-TAT after BPI resulted in markedly enhanced antilymphoma activity to a roughly 80% and 70% loss of viability in Ly1 and
Ly10 cells, respectively (Fig. 4C).
BPI and p53 activation can induce different types of cell
death. To better understand BPI and p53 antilymphoma effects, we

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

explored death mechanisms triggered by these agents alone or in
combination. For example, in addition to apoptosis, p53 can also
activate a necrosis-like cell death program in distinct tumor cell
types (27). In the search for more effective therapies, the induction
of alternative death pathways may be important to bypass
resistance mechanisms associated with a particular type of cell
death (27, 28). To determine whether 24-hour exposure to BPI and
p53C¶-TAT induce the same or alternative p53-dependent cell death
pathways, Ly4, Ly1, and Ly10 were examined microscopically by
ethidium bromide/acridine orange staining, and by flow cytometry
using Annexin V and propidium iodide (Fig. 5; Supplementary
Fig. S4). Cells undergoing necrosis can be distinguished from
apoptotic cells based on morphologic criteria, including cellular
shape, cellular volume, chromatin condensation, nuclear fragmentation, and status of the plasma membrane (29).
In accordance with a recent report on p53 COOH-terminal
peptide effects in prostate cancer cells (27), we found that p53C¶TAT induced mostly a necrotic-type cell death in DLBCL cells

regardless of the mutation status of p53 (Fig. 5A first and second
row; Supplementary Fig. S4). Ly1 cells exposed to BPI for
24 hours showed a morphologically apoptotic type of death,
whereas Ly10 cells exhibit a necrotic type cell of death similar to
that induced by p53C¶-TAT (Fig. 5A third row; Supplementary
Fig. S4). The concurrent administration of BPI and p53C¶-TAT
increased both types of death, with a higher proportion of necrosis
in Ly10 cells than in Ly1 cells (Fig. 5A fourth row; Supplementary
Fig. S4). Moreover, BPI alone or in combination with p53C¶-TAT
strongly induced DNA fragmentation and caspase-7 and caspase-3
activity in Ly1 cells, consistent with death by apoptosis (Fig. 5B

and C). In contrast, Ly10 and Ly4 cells displayed minimal changes in
DNA fragmentation or caspase activation (Fig. 5B and C). Apoptosis
is an energy/ATP–dependent process, whereas, in contrast, ATP
levels dissipate rapidly in cells undergoing necrosis (30), perhaps
due to cellular depletion of NAD+ by poly(ADP)ribose polymerase
(PARP; refs. 31, 32), with consequent depletion of ATP. On the
contrary, in most apoptotic cells, PARP is inactivated by caspasedependent cleavage (33) and the cellular ATP pool is not depleted.
We found that after 18 hours of exposure of Ly4, Ly1, and Ly10 cells
to p53C¶-TAT, there is a sharp decline in the cellular levels of ATP
whereas the PARP protein remains intact (Fig. 5D). A similar effect
was observed after BPI exposure in Ly10 cells. However, Ly1 cells
treated with BPI maintained levels of ATP similar to control-treated
cells whereas the PARP protein was cleaved in this cell line (Fig. 5D).
Concomitant administration of BPI and p53C¶-TAT yielded a mixed
result with partial ATP depletion and a lesser extent of PARP
cleavage. Taken together, these results indicate that the type of cell
death induced depends on the mechanism of action of the
therapeutic agent (p53C¶-TAT induces mostly necrosis) and on the
genetic background of the tumor cell.
Cotargeting of BCL6 and p53 enhances antilymphoma
activity. Recent screening efforts identified small molecules that
reactivate a greater spectrum of p53 mutants and with higher
efficiency than p53-derived COOH-terminal peptides. One such
molecule is called PRIMA-1 (34). The mechanism of action of
PRIMA-1 is not yet fully understood, but may involve the
promotion of refolding of mutant forms of p53 into active
conformations (35). Our data suggest that combinatorial targeting
of BCL6 and p53 could provide enhanced antilymphoma activity by
inducing either apoptosis or necrosis in DLBCL cell lines. To
confirm and expand these results, we examined BPI and PRIMA-1
effects in a larger panel of DLBCL cell lines, including one BCL6independent (Ly4) and six BCL6-dependent cell lines. We analyzed,
by direct sequencing, the TP53 mutational status in this panel of
cells and found that on top of the reported mutations, Ly4 and Ly1
have additional mutations affecting the DNA binding region of p53
(G245D and R249K, respectively; Supplementary Table S1). The SUDHL4 and Farage cell lines contained R273C and E285Q mutations,
respectively, affecting the DNA binding region of p53. Ly10, Ly3, and
SU-DHL6 had WT p53 (Supplementary Table S1). PRIMA-1 has
been reported to preferentially reactivate and induce cell death in
tumor cells with mutant p53 proteins (34). We determined the
GI50 for PRIMA-1 in our panel of DLBCL cell lines (Fig. 6A) and
found that in fact the GI50 for cell lines with mutated p53 were
significantly lower than for those cell lines with WT p53 (P =
0.0004, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test; Fig. 6A; Supplementary Table S2).
To determine whether PRIMA-1 cooperates with BPI in killing
lymphoma cells, we exposed BPI-responsive DLBCL cells to each
drug alone or in combination. The dose of BPI used was the median
of the GI25 values of the cell lines ( for a single dose exposure) and
the dose of PRIMA-1 was the median of the GI50 of the most
responsive cell lines. We found that the concurrent administration
of BPI and PRIMA-1 decreased the viability for all the cell lines to a
higher degree than either compound alone (Fig. 6B). With the
exception of Ly10, this effect was preceded by an increase in the
activity of the executioner caspases, caspase-7 and caspase-3,
suggesting that apoptosis contributes to the antilymphoma effect of
combined therapy in most cell lines (Fig. 6C). Because BPI can
induce p53 expression in DLBCL cells, which is the therapeutic
target of PRIMA-1, we predicted that the most effective sequencing
strategy would consist of first treating with BPI followed by

Figure 4. BCL6 inhibition plus p53 activation cooperates to kill DLBCL cells. A, Ly4, Ly1, and Ly10 DLBCL cells were exposed to 10 Amol/L p53C¶-TAT peptide
or p53 control peptide for 48 h and mRNA was collected at the indicated time points for RT-PCR determination of p53 transcript abundance of GADD45A (green line ),
PUMA (red line ), NOXA (blue line ), PIG3 (yellow line ), and p21 (gray line ). Results are expressed as fold of induction related to control peptide and normalized
by GADPH. Results represent the mean of biological triplicates, each of which was performed in experimental triplicates. B, Ly4, Ly1, and Ly10 DLBCL cells were
exposed to 5 Amol/L BPI + 10 Amol/L p53C¶-TAT versus the respective control combinations for 12 h. mRNA was collected and transcript abundance of GADD45A
(green line ), PUMA (red line ), NOXA (blue line ), PIG3 (yellow line ), and p21 (gray line ) detected by qPCR. The results were normalized by GADPH and expressed
as a combination index [CI = (fold increase of mRNA by BPI + fold increase of mRNA by p53C¶-TAT) / fold mRNA increase BPI + p53C¶-TAT], calculated with
respect to control peptides (CP and P53-CP for BPI and P53-AP, respectively). Results represent the mean of biological triplicates, each of which was performed
in experimental triplicates. C, the indicated DLBCL cells were exposed sequentially to the following combination of peptides: 5 Amol/L BPI control peptide followed
24 h later by 10 Amol/L p53 control peptide (white columns ); 5 Amol/L BPI control peptide followed 24 h later by 10 Amol/L p53C¶-TAT (light gray columns ); 5 Amol/L

administration of PRIMA-1 to maximally up-regulate p53 activity.
This might be particularly critical in the case of mutant p53, which
is more functionally enhanced by PRIMA-1 than WT. To determine
whether there is a schedule-dependent activity for the combination
of BPI and PRIMA-1, cells were exposed for 48 hours to the
sequences of BPI at 0 hours followed by PRIMA-1 at 24 hours and
PRIMA-1 at 0 hours followed by BPI at 24 hours. We found that
the sequence of administration did not greatly affect the
combination index values for cells with WT p53, whereas cells with
mutant p53 tend to respond better to the sequence BPI ! PRIMA-1
(Fig. 6D; Supplementary Table S3).

Discussion
Our study addresses the therapeutic targeting and functional
interaction between BCL6 and p53 in the setting of DLBCL. Previous
reports have shown that p53 expression is relatively common in
DLBCL and that its presence is not necessarily correlated with
mutations of its coding sequence (reviewed in ref. 36). Although
p53 is a BCL6 target gene, a recent report showed that p53 was
expressed in BCL6 positive germinal center B-cell type DLBCLs (37).
Similarly, we found that median p53 transcript abundance was
greater in the BCL6-positive B-cell receptor–type DLBCL and that
BCL6 and p53 proteins can be coexpressed in DLBCL (Supplemen-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (9). May 1, 2008

tary Fig. S5). p53 was also expressed in all DLBCL cell lines
examined, whether it was mutated or not. However, inhibition of
BCL6 in DLBCL cells induced a higher expression of p53. These
results suggest that p53 expression is maintained below a critical
threshold by BCL6 and/or that p53 is functionally impaired in the
presence of BCL6, as otherwise p53 would be expected to
counteract BCL6-mediated survival and proliferation. Our data
support this scenario because BPI induced the amount and activity
of p53 as judged by transcriptional activation of target genes and
biological effects. Many mechanisms could account for the
functional impairment of p53 in the presence of BCL6 in DLBCLs.
One of them could be a BCL6-dependent repression of genes
upstream of p53 that control its activity through posttranslational
modifications. We have recently shown that BCL6 directly represses
ATR, a protein kinase and master regulator of DNA damage sensing
and genomic integrity (7). Accordingly, BPI could induce ATR
expression and activity, resulting in phosphorylation and activation
of p53 (7). Our most recent preliminary data suggest that BCL6 may
also impair p53 acetylation (38).
Another mechanism through which BCL6 might attenuate the
activity of p53 is by downstream interference with the p53 transcriptional program. It was reported that BCL6 can directly repress
p21 (5) and we find that BPI can induce p21 in a p53-independent
manner. BCL6 disruption of the p53 program is even more extensive,

Figure 5. BPI and p53 restoration can induce different types of cell death. A, Ly4, Ly1, and Ly10 cells treated for 24 h with control peptides (first row ), 10 Amol/L
p53C¶-TAT (second row ), 5 Amol/L BPI (third row ), or the combination of BPI and p53C¶-TAT (fourth row) were examined (400 is shown) by ethidium bromide/acridine
orange staining to categorize the morphologic aspect of dead cells. In the ethidium bromide/acridine orange method, live cells exhibit a morphologically normal
green nucleus; early apoptotic cells are smaller and have a bright green nucleus (indicating condensed or fragmented chromatin with intact plasma membrane);
late apoptotic cells are smaller and display bright orange fragmented nucleus (indicating condensed chromatin and affected plasma membrane); whereas necrotic cells
are larger and have a structurally normal orange nucleus (indicating cytoplasm swelling, noncondensed chromatin, and rupture of the plasma membrane that can
be lost in the late necrosis). EA, early apoptosis; LA, late apoptosis; N, necrosis; LN, late necrosis; V, viable; BN, binucleated cell; D, cell debris. Percentages for
each type of dead (necrotic or apoptotic-like in red and yellow , respectively) and viable cells (green ) from triplicate experiments are shown in the bars. For each
triplicate, we categorized at least 300 cells per experimental condition. B, DNA fragmentation was measured by mononucleosome and oligonucleosome enrichment

Targeting the BCL6 Network

because we find that BCL6 can directly repress GADD45A and
reported previously that BCL6 directly regulates additional DNA
damage checkpoint genes, including GADD45B and CHEK1 (6). BCL6
can thus suppress genomic integrity checkpoints at multiple levels,
an effect that is presumably necessary for survival of GC B-cells but
that also contributes to lymphomagenesis.
Our current data help to link the biochemical mechanism of
action of BCL6 with its biological effects in lymphoma cell survival.
DLBCL survival requires binding of the SMRT and N-CoR corepressors to the BCL6 BTB domain, which is the target of BPI (6, 8).
The fact that BPI up-regulates p53 indicates that repression of p53
is dependent on SMRT and N-CoR and explains in part how blockade of the BCL6 BTB domain can kill lymphoma cells. In contrast,
BPI has no effect on BCL6 target genes involved in differentiation
such as PRDM1 (8). Instead, BCL6 represses PRDM1 through the
MTA3/NuRD corepressor complex (12, 39). Opposite to BPI, MTA3
depletion induced differentiation but not cell death (12). Therefore,
these results show the functional separation of BCL6-controlled
pathways due to differential corepressor requirements.
Taken together, our data reveal a complex functional relationship
between p53 and BCL6 in DLBCL and show that although p53 is often
expressed in association with BCL6, it is in a relatively inactive state
that can be switched on by therapeutically targeting BCL6.

Restoration of p53 function in tumor cells has been the focus of
intense research, either through gene therapy approaches or through
small-molecule or peptide therapies aiming to stabilize p53 protein or
enhance its transcriptional activity (40). The fact that p53 is usually
WT in BCL6-positive DLBCL and can be switched on by blocking
BCL6 presents an excellent opportunity for harnessing the therapeutic potential of p53. The ability to sequentially target successive
waves of transcription factors introduces the concept of tandem
transcription therapy. In this case, inhibiting BCL6 makes available a
second transcription factor (p53), which can also be therapeutically
targeted by enhancing its activity. Because blocking BCL6 and
enhancing p53 is harmless to normal tissues (8, 18), it may be possible
to extensively reprogram death pathways in lymphoma cells with
minimal effects on the host. Thus, given sufficient information on the
transcriptional networks that sustain specific tumor types, it could be
possible in the future to deliver combinatorial therapy that would
eliminate or reduce the need for chemotherapy drugs.
