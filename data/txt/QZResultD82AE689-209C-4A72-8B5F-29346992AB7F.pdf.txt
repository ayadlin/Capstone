Abstract
The drug efﬂux transporter ABCB5 identiﬁes cancer stem–like cells (CSC) in diverse human malignancies,
where its expression is associated with clinical disease progression and tumor recurrence. ABCB5 confers
therapeutic resistance, but other functions in tumorigenesis independent of drug efﬂux have not been
described that might help explain why it is so broadly overexpressed in human cancer. Here we show that in
melanoma-initiating cells, ABCB5 controls IL1b secretion, which serves to maintain slow cycling, chemoresistant cells through an IL1b/IL8/CXCR1 cytokine signaling circuit. This CSC maintenance circuit involved
reciprocal paracrine interactions with ABCB5-negative cancer cell populations. ABCB5 blockade induced
cellular differentiation, reversed resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents, and impaired tumor growth
in vivo. Together, our results deﬁned a novel function for ABCB5 in CSC maintenance and tumor growth.

Introduction
ABCB5 [ATP-binding cassette, subfamily B (MDR/TAP),
member 5] is a plasma membrane protein and human Pglycoprotein family member, shown to be highly overexpressed
by cancer stem cells (CSC) in diverse human malignancies (1–
7). ABCB5 is associated with clinical tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and recurrence in patients with cancer
(1, 4, 6–12), including in malignant melanoma (1, 4, 8–12).
Melanoma stem cells, also known as malignant melanomainitiating cells (MMIC; ref. 1), are malignant subpopulations in
which clinical virulence resides as a consequence of unlimited
self-renewal capacity, resulting in inexorable tumor progression and metastasis (1, 2, 4, 5, 9, 13–18). Our laboratory and
others recently identiﬁed MMIC (1, 2, 4, 5, 13, 14, 18) and
showed them to express the targetable biomarker (1, 4, 6, 7, 9–
12, 16) and drug-resistance mediator (6, 7, 19), ABCB5.
Although successful MMIC isolation techniques have been
shown to require trypsin-free tumor dissociation protocols

(reviewed in refs. 20 and 21) that have as of yet not been
adopted by all investigators in the ﬁeld (22, 23), the existence of
clinically relevant MMIC that express ABCB5 (1, 15, 17, 19) has
been broadly conﬁrmed in diverse experimental model systems (2–5, 16) and across multiple patient cohorts (1, 4, 9–
12, 24). Moreover, consistent with a potential functional role in
MMIC, ABCB5 genetic variation is associated with melanoma
risk (25). Nevertheless, despite the established relationship
between ABCB5 expression and MMIC (1–5, 15–17, 19) or CSC
in other cancers (6, 7), the intrinsic molecular function of
ABCB5 in tumorigenic and therapy-refractory cancer subpopulations is currently unknown (26).
Here, we hypothesized that ABCB5 might provide a novel
functional link between MMIC maintenance, multidrug-resistance, and tumor growth in human malignant melanoma. Our
data reveal that ABCB5 drives secretion of IL1b to maintain an
IL1b/IL8/CXCR1 cytokine signaling circuit controlling these
properties of aggressive melanomas.

Melanoma cell lines and clinical specimens
Authenticated human melanoma cell lines were obtained
from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). MUM-2B and
MUM-2C were a gift of Dr. M. Hendrix (Northwestern University, Evanston, IL) and are identical with cutaneous C8161
melanoma cells and OCM-1 uveal melanoma cells, respectively,
based on short tandem repeat analysis (E. Seftor/M. Hendrix,
personal communication). RNA from 8 additional melanoma
cell lines of the NCI-60 panel (Fig. 2; ref. 19) was obtained from
the NCI/NIH. Stable shRNA pSUPER-retro-puro-ABCB5-KD
cell populations and the respective vector- or shRNA-control
cell populations used the previously validated ABCB5 shRNA

myc, or vector, populations used a pCMV6 plasmid (Origene).
A375/dacarbazine (DTIC) cells were generated by incubation
of wild-type A375 cells with increasing concentrations of DTIC
(Sigma; up to 900 mmol/L) over a period of 4 weeks. Clinical
cutaneous melanoma cells and melanoma tissue sections were
derived from surgical specimen according to Institutional
Review Board–approved human subjects research protocols
as described previously (1, 15).
Xenotransplantation
NOD/SCID IL2rg / (NSG) mice were purchased from
The Jackson Laboratory. Mice were maintained in accordance with the institutional guidelines of Children's Hospital
Boston and Harvard Medical School and experiments were
carried out according to approved experimental protocols.
Human xenografts were established by subcutaneous injection (106 cells per recipient) as described (1, 15, 17). Differences in tumor volume (TV), determined as described (1),
were statistically compared by the nonparametric Mann–
Whitney test, with a 2-sided value of P < 0.05 considered
signiﬁcant. G3361 tumor xenografts were harvested for
pigmentation measurements after collagenase treatment,
as described (25). In additional experiments aimed at the
assessment of in vivo tumor cell proliferation, ﬂuorescent
membrane dye DiO-labeled (27) G3361 melanoma cells were
xenografted at 5  106 cells/recipient, and established
tumors harvested at 3 weeks after xenotransplantation for
ﬂow cytometric assessment of label retention.
Drugs and cell viability assays
For ABCB5-KD and control melanoma cells, 2.5  102
cells/well were seeded into 96-well plates with drug or
vehicle, for up to 7 days. For antibody-mediated ABCB5
inhibition, 1  104 cells/well were seeded for up to 3 days
drug exposure in the presence of 50 mg/mL anti-ABCB5
monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3C2-1D12 or MOPC31C isotype
control mAb (Sigma). Treated cultures were subjected to the
MTT assay as described (19). For examination of the effects
of ABCB5 blockade on IL8 and WFDC1 gene expression in
A375 and G3361 cells and clinical melanoma specimens,
statistical differences in mRNA expression (n ¼ 5/group)
were determined using the Student t test.
Flow cytometry
ABCB5/CXCR1 or ABCB5/CXCR2 stains used APC-conjugated anti-ABCB5 mAb (clone 3C2–1D12) or isotype control
mAb and FITC-conjugated anti-CXCR1 or anti-CXCR2 mAbs
(R&D Systems) or FITC-conjugated isotype controls (BD PharMingen). Analysis of ABCB5 expression by A375/DTIC cells and
A375/WT controls was performed following ﬁxation and permeabilization of cells to detect total ABCB5 protein. BrdUrd
incorporation: 2  105 puriﬁed ABCB5(þ) G3361 cells were
cultured for 72 hours in the presence of 10 mmol/L BrdUrd and
5 mg/mL inhibitory CXCR1 antibody or isotype control antibody (R&D Systems). Subsequently, cells were ﬁrst surface
stained for ABCB5, then permeabilized and subjected to DNase
digestion, followed by counterstaining with FITC-conjugated
anti-BrdUrd antibody and 7-AAD using a BrdUrd/7-AAD Flow

www.aacrjournals.org

Cytometry Kit (BD Pharmingen). 7-AAD–gated ABCB5(þ) cells
and derived ABCB5() cells were then analyzed for BrdUrd
incorporation. DiO (Invitrogen Molecular Probes) in vivo label
retention: G3361 cells were labeled in vitro as described (27),
xenografted as described above, followed by preparation of
single tumor cell suspensions (1), and DiO label-retention by
ABCB5(þ) versus ABCB5() cells in each tumor was then
measured by ﬂow cytometry (n ¼ 4). Statistical differences
between marker expression levels were determined by the
Mann–Whitney test.
Cell isolation
ABCB5(þ) or CXCR1(þ) cells were isolated by magnetic
bead sorting as described (1).
Correlation of ABCB5 mRNA expression and cell
doubling times
Melanoma cell cDNA was prepared from RNA extracts using
SuperScript First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen). ABCB5
qPCR was performed as described (19). ABCB5 expression was
assessed by the ratio of the expression level in the sample
against mean expression in all samples, in n ¼ 3 independent
experiments. Culture doubling times for the 8 NCI-60 cell lines
were obtained from the National Cancer Institute. Growth
kinetics for the remaining cell lines were established according
to the formula: doubling time (h) ¼ T2  T1/[log2 (cell countT2
/cell countT1)], where T2 and T1 represent 2 distinct time
points (h) in the logarithmic culture growth phase. Upon
correlation of ABCB5 mRNA expression with culture doubling
times, a Pearson coefﬁcient was calculated and the criteria of
P < 0.05 and r > 0.3 or r < 0.3 were used to identify signiﬁcance
(19).
Gene expression microarray analyses
Microarray analyses were carried out on ABCB5-KD or
control shRNA G3361 or A375 RNA (n ¼ 3 replicates per
group). Microarrays (HG-U133A 2.0; Affymetrix) were performed by the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Boston, MA)
core facility. CEL ﬁles were normalized using Robust Multichip Averaging (RMA) available at http://www.babelomics.org.
Probe-sets detected on fewer than 4 of the 6 chips for each cellline (P as determined by MAS5) were discarded. Differentially
expressed probe-sets were identiﬁed using one-way ANOVA.
Probesets with P < 0.05 (estimated false discovery rate of 6.1%)
were subjected to Tukey post hoc test and those with signiﬁcant
differences in ABCB5-KD cells versus controls were ranked by
fold change. The expression dataset in its entirety is available
through Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (accession
number GSE38290).
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis
qPCR (SYBR green) used 18s as a normalizing control. IL8
and WFDC1 primers were from Origene. Primers for 18s and
ABCB5 were as described (7), and for CXCR1, F: 50 -TATTCATCAAGTGCCCTCTAGCTGT-30 and R: 50 -TTAGATCATCAAAATCCCACATCTG-30 . Quantitative WNT expression analysis
utilized WNT real-time qPCR arrays (PAHS-043) from SA
Biosciences (Qiagen).

Western blots and ELISA
RIPA cell lysates were incubated with IL8 antibody (Abcam
clone 6217), WFDC1 antibody (Sigma Prestige rabbit polyclonal,
HPA031411), or a-tubulin antibody (Abcam rabbit polyclonal
ab24246). IL8 ELISA used 50 mL of debris-cleared supernatants of
ABCB5(þ) or ABCB5() G3361 cultures (72-hour cultures of 105
cells/well in 24-well plates containing 0.5 mL/well of serum-free
media) compared with medium-only negative controls and
rhIL8 standard curves (Quantikine ELISA; R&D Systems). For
in vivo ELISA analysis of hIL8 production from human G3361
xenografts, mice were sacriﬁced 3 weeks after xenotransplantation. Subsequently, 50 mL of cell-cleared serum (cardiac puncture then spun 5 min/5,000 rpm) was assayed in triplicate wells
for duplicate mice/xenograft cell type, using internal negative
serum controls. For ABCB5 blockade, puriﬁed CXCR1(þ) or
CXCR1() cells were seeded in 96-well plates with addition of
100 mg/mL ABCB5 mAb or MOPC31C isotype mAb on ice for 30
minutes. After 30 minutes, cells were placed at 37 C with 5% CO2
and stimulated with 5 mg/mL LPS for 1 hour, then 5 mmol/L ATP
þ 1 mmol/L nigericin for 3 hours. Media was extracted from all
samples, spun to remove cells, and hIL1b ELISAs were then
performed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Quantikine-HS; R&D Systems).
Immunohistochemistry and immunoﬂuorescence
staining
Cryostat sections (5 mm) from snap-frozen specimens
obtained from metastatic melanoma tumors were ﬁxed in
acetone for 10 minutes and then dried and blocked with
0.3% peroxidase for 5 minutes. mAbs to CXCR1 (clone LSA806), CXCR2 (clone LS-C90306), and IL8 (clone LS-C8034)
were purchased from LS Biosciences. mAbs to TLR4 (clone
ab13556) and IL1b (clone ab2105) were purchased from
Abcam. The ABCB5 antibody (clone 3C2–1D12) was used as
described (15).
Immunohistochemistry. After primary antibody incubation samples were treated with secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)–conjugated antibody or secondary AP-conjugated
antibody (Dako) followed by 3,3 diaminobenzidin-tetrahydrochlorid (DAB; Bio Genex) or Fast Red (5361; Dako) and nuclear
staining (Mayer's hemalaun; Merck). Immunoﬂuorescence
staining of parafﬁn-embedded clinical melanoma involved
TLR4 antibody (Novus Biologicals) followed by Alexa Fluor594 secondary antibody, and ABCB5 primary antibody (clone
3C2–1D12) followed by addition of biotinylated horse antimouse IgG and Alexa Fluor-488–labeled streptavidin.

Results
ABCB5 regulates melanoma growth and multidrug
resistance
To initially address the functional role of ABCB5 in melanoma growth, we generated ABCB5 shRNA stably transfected
knockdown (KD) melanoma cell populations (termed ABCB5KD herein, KD efﬁciency >80% at mRNA level and validated by
IP Western blotting), using the well-studied nonpigmented
melanoma cell-line model A375 and the pigmented melanoma
cell-line G3361, which had previously been utilized in MMIC
characterization studies and conﬁrmed to express represen-

tative levels of ABCB5 (1, 15, 17, 27). G3361 or A375 ABCB5-KD
cells or respective control populations were subcutaneously
injected (1  106 cells/mouse) into highly immunocompromised NSG mice (G3361, n ¼ 5 and A375, n ¼ 12 animals/
group) and tumor progression was followed for up to 9 weeks
(G3361) or until experimental protocol stipulations necessitated animal sacriﬁce because of excessive tumor burden
(A375: 5 weeks), by serial determination of tumor volumes
(TV). We observed signiﬁcant impairment of in vivo tumor
growth upon ABCB5 inhibition at serial time points throughout the course of the experiment (Fig. 1A), with ﬁnal TV
measurements showing 2.9-fold inhibition for G3361 [TV week
9 ABCB5-KD: 126  43 mm3 (mean  SEM) vs. TV week 9
control: 364  37 mm3, P ¼ 0.0030) and 3.1-fold inhibition for
A375 (TV week 5 ABCB5-KD: 638.5  78 mm3 vs. TV week 5
control: 1,801  168 mm3, P ¼ 2.32  105; Fig. 1A], demonstrating a novel intrinsic functional role of ABCB5 in melanoma
growth. Furthermore, for G3361 (a pigmented melanoma line
as opposed to nonpigmented A375 cells), we also noted signiﬁcantly enhanced pigmentation of ABCB5-KD tumors versus
controls (2.7-fold enhancement detected spectrophotometrically; OD490nm ABCB5-KD: 0.0626  0.0136 (mean  SEM) vs.
OD490nm control: 0.0234  0.0095, n ¼ 5 respectively, P ¼
0.044; Fig. 1B), demonstrating ABCB5 inhibition-mediated in
vivo differentiation of at baseline lesser-differentiated and
lower-pigmented (1) ABCB5(þ) MMIC.
We next performed an in-depth analysis to assess the
functional role of ABCB5 as a multidrug-resistance mediator
in melanoma with respect to chemotherapeutic agents either
approved for clinical use in melanoma (DTIC), or previously
shown to exhibit signiﬁcant strong positive correlations
between drug resistance and ABCB5 expression (paclitaxel,
teniposide, docetaxel, etoposide, doxorubicin, and vincristine)
in melanoma and other malignancies (19, 20), using both
shRNA-mediated or mAb-mediated ABCB5 inhibition strategies. Targeted shRNA-mediated ABCB5 inhibition resulted in
signiﬁcant reversal of chemoresistance to all agents (IC90, n ¼ 6
each: DTIC: 15-fold, P ¼ 3  107; paclitaxel: 9.4-fold, P ¼ 8.7 
104; teniposide: 7.3-fold, P ¼ 3.4  104; docetaxel: 6-fold, P ¼
2  105; etoposide: 3.9-fold, P ¼ 2  107; doxorubicin: 3-fold,
P ¼ 2  106; vincristine: 2.6-fold, P ¼ 2  105; Fig. 1C),
demonstrating for the ﬁrst time that ABCB5 serves as a bona
ﬁde multidrug-resistance mediator in human melanoma. mAbmediated ABCB5 inhibition, using the extracellular loop-speciﬁc antibody clone 3C2–1D12 (1, 2, 8), also signiﬁcantly
sensitized melanoma cells to killing by this set of agents, thus
conﬁrming the results obtained with shRNA-mediated ABCB5
inhibition (IC50, n ¼ 6 each: vincristine: 8.4-fold, P ¼ 0.038;
doxorubicin: 4.9-fold, P ¼ 8.2  103; teniposide: 2.9-fold, P ¼ 2
 105; paclitaxel: 1.9-fold, P ¼ 0.012; etoposide: 1.9-fold, P ¼ 3
 105; DTIC: 1.5-fold, P ¼ 9  105; docetaxel: 1.5-fold, P ¼
0.011; Fig. 1C). Results of mAb-mediated ABCB5 inhibition with
respect to chemosensitization to the agent approved for
clinical use in melanoma (DTIC) also revealed signiﬁcant
sensitization in A375 melanoma cells (IC50: 1.6-fold, P <
0.001), similar to the effect observed in G3361 cells. These
results demonstrated two novel important functional roles of
ABCB5 in melanoma: ﬁrst, that ABCB5 is required for more

efﬁcient melanoma growth, with inhibition resulting in smaller, more differentiated tumors; and second, that ABCB5
functions as a melanoma multidrug-resistance mechanism
for diverse chemotherapeutic compounds, including the mainstay clinical melanoma chemotherapeutic DTIC, to which
ABCB5(þ) melanoma subpopulations have been reported to
be therapy-refractory in patients (8).
ABCB5 identiﬁes and regulates slow-cycling melanoma
cells
Recent studies suggested that CSC can be slow cycling,
potentially causing resistance to cancer treatments that target
more rapidly dividing cells (16, 28). Based on the known role of
ABCB5 as a marker of MMIC and its herein-deﬁned functions
in DTIC and multidrug resistance, we hypothesized that
ABCB5(þ) MMIC are slow cycling and that ABCB5 might
functionally regulate cellular quiescence, a potential mechanism of multidrug-resistance independent of drug transport
function. Using an experimental model system whereby established G3361 melanoma cells were labeled with the ﬂuorescent
cell-membrane dye DiO (27) and subsequently xenografted
subcutaneously to immunodeﬁcient mice in order to assess
cellular dye retention as a measure of cellular quiescence in
growing tumors, we found that ABCB5(þ) MMIC retained
signiﬁcantly higher amounts of DiO compared with ABCB5
() melanoma bulk populations (5-fold, P < 0.05, n ¼ 4),
providing initial in vivo evidence that ABCB5(þ) MMIC represent a slow-cycling tumor cell subpopulation (Fig. 2A).
Furthermore, separation of unlabeled ABCB5(þ) and ABCB5
() G3361 melanoma cells by magnetic cell sorting and

4200

Cancer Res; 74(15) August 1, 2014

subsequent comparison of their relative growth rates by serial
daily MTT assays for 1 week conﬁrmed in vitro that ABCB5(þ)
cells grow more slowly than ABCB5() melanoma bulk populations [log OD/h, n ¼ 5: ABCB5(þ) cells: 11.5  0.4  103
(mean  SD) vs. ABCB5() cells: 9.4  0.6  103, P ¼
0.0158; Fig. 2B], consistent with a previously demonstrated
cell-cycle proﬁle of ABCB5(þ) cells with enhanced G2 arrest
compared with ABCB5() cells (19). To assess a possible
functional role of ABCB5 in this slow-cycling phenotype, we
compared the growth rates of ABCB5-KD G3361 cells to control
G3361 cells, demonstrating a signiﬁcantly increased growth
rate upon ABCB5 inhibition [day 5 MTT OD595: ABCB5-KD cells
¼ 1.317  0.025 (mean  SEM) vs. control cells ¼ 0.931  0.024,
P < 0.01; Fig. 2C] and hence a functional role of ABCB5 in
regulating melanoma cell quiescence. Moreover, analysis of a
panel of 12 melanoma cell lines demonstrated a signiﬁcant
correlation of relative ABCB5 expression with culture doubling
times (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r ¼ 0.655, P < 0.0001; Fig.
2C), consistent with the newly discovered role of ABCB5 in
melanoma cellular quiescence. These results showed that
ABCB5 identiﬁes a slow-cycling melanoma cell subpopulation
and indicated a functional role of ABCB5 in the maintenance of
this slow-cycling MMIC subset.
ABCB5 represses the tumor suppressor WFDC1 and
induces the melanoma tumor promoter IL8 through the
WNT pathway
To obtain mechanistic insight to explain why ABCB5 ablation led to impaired tumorigenesis, chemosensitization, and
reversal of melanoma quiescence, we ﬁrst compared triplicate

suppressor protein expressed in differentiated epidermal melanocytes and downregulated by gene methylation in melanoma cells (29), and because overexpression of WFDC1 in A375
melanoma cells has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor
growth in vivo (30), induction of WFDC1 following ABCB5
inhibition provided one explanation for ABCB5-KD–induced
tumor inhibition. Moreover, because IL8 is a known mediator
of clinical melanoma aggressiveness acting to functionally
promote carcinogenesis (31, 32) and DTIC resistance (33,
34), reduced IL8 production following ABCB5 inhibition provided an additional explanation for ABCB5 inhibition–induced
impairment of melanoma growth and sensitization to DTICinduced cell killing. Importantly, mAb-mediated ABCB5 inhibition at the protein level in G3361 and A375 cells, as well as in a
panel of 3 patient-derived melanoma specimens, conﬁrmed
the speciﬁcity of shRNA-mediated ABCB5-KD on WFDC1 and
IL8 expression (WFDC1: 2.54-fold increased expression in
ABCB5 mAb-treated vs. isotype control mAb-treated samples,
n ¼ 5, P ¼ 0.0079; IL8: 0.57-fold expression in ABCB5 mAbtreated vs. isotype control mAb-treated samples, n ¼ 5, P ¼
0.0019), and demonstrated that these results can be extrapolated to clinical melanoma specimens (Fig. 3D).
WFDC1 has recently been hypothesized to act as a repressor
of WNT signaling in melanoma, whereas IL8 has been demonstrated to be a downstream WNT target gene (30, 35, 36). In
light of the ﬁndings of this study, this suggested a potential
functional link between WFDC1 and IL8 via WNT signaling in
an ABCB5-regulated pathway. In support of this hypothesis,
qPCR-based WNT pathway array analysis demonstrated downregulated expression levels of several WNT members, that is
WNT1, WNT5A, WNT6, WNT7B, WNT9A, WNT10A, and
WNT11 in ABCB5-KD G3361 and A375 cells compared with
controls (Fig. 3E). To establish if relative WFDC1 overexpression in ABCB5-KD cells might be partly responsible for WNT
downregulation, we next overexpressed WFDC1-myc in G3361
or A375 cells and remeasured expression of WNT pathway
members by qPCR array (Fig. 3F). Similar to ABCB5 inhibition,
WFDC1-myc overexpression resulted in signiﬁcant inhibition
of WNT1, WNT7B, WNT9A, WNT10A, and WNT11 in WFDC1myc cells compared with vector controls (Fig. 3F), indicating
that ABCB5 regulates WNT signaling at least in part through
inhibition of the WNT repressor WFDC1. Moreover, like
ABCB5 inhibition, WFDC1-myc overexpression also signiﬁcantly inhibited IL8 production compared with vector controls
(Fig. 3F), identifying IL8 as a downstream target of inhibitory
WFDC1 signaling. The role of intermediate WNT signaling in
ABCB5() and WFDC1-regulated IL8 production in human
melanoma was further conﬁrmed utilizing drugs mimicking
either canonical or noncanonical (calcium) WNT signaling (i.e.,
lithium chloride or ionomycin/thapsigargin, respectively),
which resulted in signiﬁcant enhancement of IL8 expression
through either activation of the canonical signaling pathway
(1.75- and 2.32-fold in treated G3361 and A375 melanoma cells
vs. controls, respectively) or the noncanonical pathway (6.6and 13.7-fold in treated A375 and G3361 cells, respectively; Fig.
3G). Together, these data revealed a signaling pathway whereby ABCB5 leads to melanoma expression of IL8 through WNT
signaling, in part through repression of WFDC1 (Fig. 3H).

We tested applicability of this novel signaling pathway
further in a clinically relevant experimental model system of
ABCB5 overexpression in DTIC-resistant melanoma cells,
based on recent demonstrations that DTIC treatment induces
ABCB5 in vitro and in vivo in tumor xenotransplantation
models and human patients (8, 28). Following culture of human
A375 melanoma cells in gradually increasing doses of DTIC
over the course of several weeks, A375/DTIC cells were resistant to 900 mmol/L DTIC (a concentration capable of killing
A375/WT cells) and signiﬁcantly overexpressed ABCB5 at both
the mRNA level (18-fold) and the protein level (19.8-fold; Fig.
3I). Moreover, ABCB5-overexpressing A375/DTIC cells displayed a signiﬁcantly slower rate of growth compared with
A375/WT cells (Fig. 3J), in line with the newly demonstrated
role for ABCB5 in cellular quiescence (Fig. 2C). Consistent with
the newly identiﬁed ABCB5-regulated signaling axis (Fig. 3H),
WFDC1 levels were inhibited in ABCB5-overexpressing A375/
DTIC melanoma cells compared with controls (Fig. 3K), IL8
levels were signiﬁcantly enhanced (2.5-fold at the mRNA level,
2.6-fold at the level of secreted protein; Fig. 3K), consistent with
their reciprocal downregulation in WFDC1-myc–overexpressing cells (Fig. 3F) and their known association with melanoma
DTIC resistance (33, 34), and several WNT members, including
WNT1, WNT7B, WNT9A, WNT10A, and WNT11, were significantly induced (Fig. 3L). In aggregate, these results delineated
a novel ABCB5-regulated signaling axis culminating in expression of the oncogenic mediator and DTIC resistance–conferring cytokine IL8, which provided mechanistic insight into the
newly discovered functional role of ABCB5 in regulating melanoma growth and DTIC resistance.
ABCB5(þ) MMIC express the IL8 receptor CXCR1, and
IL8/CXCR1 signaling is required to maintain MMIC
quiescence
Both receptors for the IL8 cytokine, that is the IL8-speciﬁc
CXCR1 (IL8RA) and the more promiscuous CXCR2 (IL8RB),
have been shown to be important to melanoma progression
(37, 38). In breast cancer CXCR1 is also considered important
for maintenance of the CSC (39). Because ABCB5 marks the
MMIC subpopulation in melanoma and, as shown herein,
regulates the CXCR1/2 ligand IL8, we examined expression of
CXCR1/2 on MMIC. Costaining and FACS analysis of G3361
melanoma cells for ABCB5 and CXCR1 or CXCR2 coexpression
revealed that ABCB5(þ) cells (7% of all analyzed cells) specifically coexpressed CXCR1 but not CXCR2, which was overall
less abundantly expressed (Fig. 4A). Moreover, live sorting of
melanoma cells into ABCB5(þ) and ABCB5() or CXCR1(þ)
and CXCR1() populations followed by CXCR1 mRNA determination by qPCR showed relative overexpression of CXCR1 in
either ABCB5(þ) cells (3.7-fold enhanced) or CXCR1(þ) cells
(4.3-fold enhanced) compared with their respective markernegative controls, consistent with the ﬁndings at the protein
level that ABCB5 and CXCR1 are preferentially coexpressed on
the MMIC subpopulation (Fig. 4B). IL8 determinations performed by ELISA in supernatants of sorted ABCB5(þ) and
ABCB5() or CXCR1(þ) and CXCR1() cells conﬁrmed that
IL8 was secreted by ABCB5(þ) or CXCR1(þ) melanoma subpopulations, and furthermore showed that ABCB5() or

CXCR1(þ) cells: 399 ng/mL vs. CXCR1() cells: 2,143 ng/mL],
indicating the potential for either autocrine IL8 signaling by
ABCB5(þ)/CXCR1(þ) MMIC, or paracrine IL8 signaling from
melanoma bulk populations to the ABCB5(þ) MMIC, to stimulate the CXCR1 receptor (Fig. 4C). Consistent with these
results obtained in established G3361 melanoma cells, in situ
analysis of clinical melanoma specimens also demonstrated
exclusive coexpression of ABCB5 with CXCR1 (Fig. 4D, left),
whereas IL8 expression was associated with either ABCB5(þ)
MMIC (Fig. 4D, right, black arrows) or, more often, ABCB5()
melanoma cells in spatial proximity to ABCB5(þ) MMIC (Fig.
4D, right, red arrows).
Based on our demonstration that ABCB5(þ) MMIC represent a slow-cycling melanoma subpopulation and the ﬁnding
that shRNA-mediated ABCB5 inhibition inhibited IL8 levels and
reduced in vitro melanoma cell doubling time, we hypothesized
that the IL8 receptor CXCR1 expressed on MMIC functions to
maintain the cellular quiescence of MMIC. Consistent with this
hypothesis, speciﬁc mAb-mediated inhibition of CXCR1 on

puriﬁed ABCB5(þ) MMIC, cultured in the presence of BrdUrd

BrdUrdhigh cells (CXCR1 mAb treatment: 21.43% vs. isotype
control mAb treatment: 4.17%), demonstrating that CXCR1
signaling in ABCB5(þ) MMIC is required to maintain MMIC
quiescence (Fig. 4E, left). We did not observe enhanced BrdUrd
incorporation by ABCB5() cells derived from puriﬁed ABCB5
(þ) MMIC, in the same cultures, which were discernible by
absence of costaining for ABCB5 [we have previously demonstrated that ABCB5(þ) melanoma cells have differentiation
capacity and generate ABCB5() cells (1); Fig. 4E, right], a
ﬁnding consistent with negativity of ABCB5() melanoma cells
for CXCR1 (Fig. 4A and D). These results showed that ABCB5(þ)
MMIC selectively express the IL8 receptor CXCR1 and that
ABCB5-regulated IL8 signaling through CXCR1 is functionally
required to maintain MMIC quiescence.

ABCB5 Maintains Melanoma–Initiating Cells

populations, we hypothesized that ABCB5 controls secretion of
an extracellular signaling molecule that activates IL8. Based on
the considerations that IL1b is a known secreted mediator of IL8
activation (40) and that IL1b might represent a substrate for
ABC transporter-mediated cellular efﬂux (41), we investigated
whether ABCB5 controls melanoma IL1b secretion. First, consistent with ABCB5 and IL8 overexpression in DTIC-resistant
versus wild-type melanoma cells, DTIC-resistant tumor cells
exhibited higher (3.2-fold) levels of IL1b secretion compared
with their wild-type counterparts (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, exogenous rIL1b treatment signiﬁcantly induced IL8 and downregulated WFDC1 expression (P < 0.001, respectively; Fig. 5B),
consistent with the demonstrated effects of ABCB5 modulation.
Moreover, we found toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a principal
regulator of IL1b expression, to be selectively expressed by
ABCB5(þ) MMIC (Fig. 5C–E) and that ABCB5(þ) MMIC preferentially express and secrete IL1b (Fig. 5E and F). To directly
demonstrate a role of ABCB5 in IL1b secretion, we subjected
puriﬁed ABCB5(þ) MMIC (isolated using coexpressed CXCR1 as
a surrogate selection marker) to mAb-mediated ABCB5 blockade or isotype control mAb treatment and assessed IL1b secretion (Fig. 5F). ABCB5 blockade abrogated IL1b release into
culture supernatants by ABCB5(þ) MMIC, demonstrating that
ABCB5 controls IL1b secretion (Fig. 5F). Thus, our results reveal
that ABCB5 controls MMIC maintenance and tumor growth
through a cytokine-dependent signaling circuit. Speciﬁcally, our
ﬁndings support a model in which ABCB5(þ) MMIC-produced
IL1b activates bulk tumor cell populations to produce protumorigenic IL8, which, in a rheostat mechanism, subsequently
induces MMIC maintenance via CXCR1 signaling (Fig. 5G).

Discussion
Our results provide initial evidence that ABCB5 represents
not only a marker for MMIC in human melanomas as demonstrated previously (1, 2, 4, 16), but that it also serves as a
functional driver of melanoma aggressiveness features through
a common molecular role in MMIC maintenance, tumor
growth, and drug resistance. Mechanistically, our study reveals
a novel ABCB5-regulated signaling pathway in human melanoma, whereby ABCB5 controls MMIC IL1b secretion, a function that serves to maintain this slow-cycling, chemoresistant
melanoma subpopulation through an IL1b/IL8/CXCR1 cytokine signaling circuit involving reciprocal paracrine interactions with ABCB5-negative cancer bulk populations (Fig. 5G).
Our results hereby show that ABCB5, through its role in IL1b
secretion, functionally links 3 distinct features of human
melanoma through this newly identiﬁed signaling pathway,
that is (i) maintenance of the slow-cycling MMIC subpopulation via IL8 signaling through MMIC-expressed CXCR1; (ii)
MMIC-driven tumorigenic growth and maintenance of undifferentiated tumor phenotype associated with IL8 production;

and (iii) IL8-driven melanoma resistance to the clinical antimelanoma agent DTIC.
Previously, we demonstrated the existence of a tumor
hierarchy in human melanoma, in which ABCB5(þ) cells,
enriched for MMIC, self-renew and give rise to more-differentiated ABCB5() tumor progeny (1). Moreover, we showed that
highly tumorigenic ABCB5(þ) MMIC can drive more differentiated and otherwise nontumorigenic ABCB5() melanoma
bulk populations to contribute, albeit less efﬁciently, to a
growing tumor mass (1). Our current study now reveals that
ABCB5 represents a key molecular mechanism governing such
CSC/tumor bulk interactions through an IL1b-dependent signaling circuit and that this mechanism also controls MMIC
rheostasis under chemotherapeutic selection pressure. Our
results hereby indicate that IL1b stimulates IL8 production
predominantly by ABCB5() melanoma bulk populations,
facilitating paracrine IL8-mediated activation of MMICexpressed CXCR1 (Fig. 5G). However, IL1b also signiﬁcantly
induced IL8 production by puriﬁed MMIC, suggesting
additional relevance of the identiﬁed ABCB5-driven cytokine
circuit to autocrine IL8-mediated CXCR1 activation. Such
autocrine signaling might be particularly relevant under conditions of relatively low frequencies or absence of ABCB5()
tumor cells within a cancer, for example in early phases of
metastasis formation by disseminated circulating ABCB5(þ)
tumor cells (9, 24), or following chemotherapeutic depletion of
more proliferative, chemosensitive ABCB5() cancer cells with
persistence of relatively quiescent, chemoresistant ABCB5(þ)
subpopulations (8).
Slow-cycling cancer cells have previously been associated
with more aggressive tumorigenic phenotypes, and have been
proposed to coincide with CSC in melanoma and other cancers.
Our results provide evidence for this hypothesis, because
ABCB5 has previously been shown to mark the MMIC (1,
2, 4, 5, 9, 15, 17). Furthermore, because both direct ABCB5
blockade or CXCR1-targeted inhibition of ABCB5-regulated IL8
signaling abrogated cellular quiescence, and because direct
ABCB5 blockade induced melanoma differentiation and inhibited tumor growth in vivo, our results provide initial evidence
that ABCB5 functionally controls slow-cycling MMIC maintenance and MMIC-driven tumor growth. These results are
consistent with recent demonstrations that slow-cycling melanoma cells are required for melanoma maintenance and
progression (16, 42). In addition, the newly identiﬁed role of
ABCB5 as a functional negative regulator of melanoma differentiation is also in line with previous studies demonstrating
that terminal melanoma differentiation is associated with
ABCB5 downregulation (43), and conversely, that Oct4-induced
melanoma dedifferentiation associated with enhanced tumorigenicity and chemoresistance is associated with ABCB5 upregulation (3).

Our ﬁnding that ABCB5 functionally regulates IL8/CXCR1
signaling in human melanoma might be relevant to additional
human malignancies in which ABCB5 is expressed and in
which critical functions of IL8/CXCR1 signaling have been
identiﬁed. For example, ABCB5 is expressed by doxorubicinresistant human breast cancer cells and has been shown to be
downregulated following differentiation therapy in patients
afﬂicted by breast cancer (44), a malignancy where IL8/CXCR1
signaling was originally shown to critically regulate CSC maintenance (39, 45). Similarly, ABCB5 is known to maintain
CD133þ CSC phenotype and to mediate doxorubicin resistance
in hepatocellular carcinoma (6), a further malignancy in which
IL8/CXCR1 signaling has been implicated in CSC function (46).
In addition, ABCB5 is overexpressed and mediates 5-FU resistance in CD133þ CSC in human colorectal cancer (7), where
IL8/CXCR1 signaling also regulates drug resistance and tumor
aggressiveness features (47). Thus, our study raises the possibility that ABCB5 represents a broadly relevant mechanism of
IL8/CXCR1 regulation in diverse human cancers, in addition to
its role in human melanoma.
Our results place ABCB5 and ABCB5-dependent IL1b signaling downstream of MMIC-expressed TLR4, a receptor for
members of the S100 protein family of endogenous inﬂammatory damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) mediators with key roles in the initiation and ampliﬁcation of cancer
development and tumor spread (48). This ﬁnding, in light of the
observation that ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced melanoma
carcinogenesis is associated with increased S100 expression
(49), is consistent with the herein newly identiﬁed role of
ABCB5 in melanomagenesis and raises, furthermore, the possibility that ABCB5 might also be functionally involved in
additional instances of inﬂammation-driven carcinogenesis
and TLR4-dependent immunoevasion (50).
In aggregate, the herein identiﬁed novel functional role of
ABCB5 in controlling MMIC quiescence and maintenance,

tumor growth, and multidrug-resistance in human melanoma
implicates ABCB5 for the ﬁrst time as a key driver of several
features of cancer aggressiveness. Moreover, this role provides
a potential explanation for its broadly observed preferential
expression by tumor-initiating and therapy-refractory cancer
subpopulations in many human malignancies.
