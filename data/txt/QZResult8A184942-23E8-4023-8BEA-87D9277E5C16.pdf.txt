Abstract
The etiology and development of human cancers that remain little understood might be enlightened by defining
tumor suppressor microRNAs (TS-miRNA). In this study, we identified TS-miRNAs silenced by aberrant DNA
hypermethylation in endometrial cancer. Functional screening of 327 synthetic miRNAs in an endometrial cancer
cell proliferation assay identified 103 miRNAs that inhibited cell growth. We then determined the sequence, DNA
methylation status, and expression levels of these miRNAs in endometrial cancer cell lines and primary tumors.
These determinations led to the identification of miR-152 as a candidate TS-miRNA gene in endometrial cancer.
Epigenetic silencing documented in miR-152 was consistent with its location at 17q21.32 in intron 1 of the COPZ2
gene, which is also silenced often in endometrial cancer by DNA hypermethylation, and also with evidence that
miR-152 targets the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1. Notably, restoration of miR-152 expression in endometrial
cancer cell lines was sufficient to inhibit tumor cell growth in vitro and in vivo. We identified E2F3, MET, and Rictor
as novel candidate targets of miR-152, suggesting how its epigenetic silencing can drive endometrial carcinogenesis. Our findings define a central role for miR-152 in endometrial cancer, and they also suggest its use in new
therapeutic strategies to treat this cancer. Cancer Res; 71(20); 6450–62. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous small nonproteincoding RNAs of 19–22 nucleotides. These single-stranded
RNAs are considered to play crucial roles in many normal
cellular processes (1–4) and the multistep processes of carcinogenesis (5, 6). Among various mechanisms of cancerrelated gene silencing in an epigenetic manner, DNA hypermethylation of CpG sites within CpG islands is known to lead
to the inactivation of many tumor suppressor genes (TSG; ref.
7) and several tumor-suppressive miRNAs (TS-miRNA; ref. 8).
Recently, in fact, DNA methylation–mediated downregulation
of miRNAs by proximal CpG islands has been described by a
number of groups, including ours (9–11), and further identification of remaining targets for methylation may clarify the
specific molecular events involved in endometrial cancer

progression, enabling the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of endometrial cancer to be approached at a molecular
level.
Endometrial cancer is the most common malignancy of the
female genital tract, and is the fourth most common malignancy in women in the United States after breast, lung, and
colon cancers. In 2009, it is estimated that 42,160 American
women were diagnosed with endometrial cancer (6% of new
cancer cases), and 7,780 women died of the disease (3% of all
cancer deaths). Worldwide, endometrial cancer is the seventh
most common cancer in women, being newly diagnosed in an
estimated 226,000 women in 2007 (12). Endometrial cancer is
generally considered to arise through the progressive accumulation of multiple genetic abnormalities, which may activate
oncogenes and inactivate TSGs. Recently, genome-wide
screenings of altered DNA methylation for exploring endometrial cancer–associated TSGs have been reported (13), though
there are few reports about epigenetic alterations of miRNA
genes in endometrial cancer.
Here, we identified a novel TS-miRNA frequently silenced
through tumor-specific DNA methylation in endometrial cancer and its multiple targets by function-based screening with a
cell proliferation assay for 327 synthetic miRNAs in HEC-1A
cell line and an approach with a series of sequential analyses of
DNA methylation and expression analysis in endometrial
cancer cell lines and primary cases. The function-based
screening makes it possible to analyze the biological effects
of a large number of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) on cancer
cells directly. In addition, this approach has already proved
successful in the exploration of dsRNAs having oncogenic
or tumor-suppressive effects on cancer cells (14, 15).

Tumor-Suppressive miRNAs in Endometrial Cancer

Consequently, a possible endometrial cancer–associated
TS-miRNA, miR-152, and novel candidates for its putative
targets were identified in our study. This study is the first
to show clearly that the tumor-suppressive activity of miR-152
is epigenetically silenced in endometrial cancer and that its
multiple targets are E2F3, MET, and Rictor.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and primary tumor samples
A total of 13 human endometrial cancer cell lines—HEC-1,
HEC-1A, HEC-1B, HEC-50B, HEC-59, HEC-108, HEC-151,
HEC-251, HEC-265, HHUA, HOOUA, Ishikawa, and SNGM—were obtained from RIKEN BioResource Center, and
authenticated at our laboratory by in-house BAC/PAC-based
arrays for array-CGH analyses (unpublished data) in December 2009. All cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, supplemented with streptomycin (100
mg/mL), penicillin (100 units/mL), 2 mmol/L glutamine, and
10% FBS. To analyze the restored expression of genes of
interest, cells were cultured with or without 10 mmol/L of 5aza 20 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-dCyd) for 5 days. A total of 70
frozen primary samples were obtained from endometrial
cancer patients (stage I, 38 cases; stage II, 8 cases; stage III,
21 cases; and stage IV, 3 cases; Supplementary Table S1) and
6 normal endometria from patients with endometriosis or
leiomyoma treated at KEIO University with written consent
from each patient and after approval by the local ethics
committee. The International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics (FIGO) classification was used.
Transfection with synthetic miRNAs and siRNAs
Endometrial cancer cells were seeded at 10,000 cells per well
in 24-well plates the day before transfection. dsRNA (10 nmol/
L) mimicking human mature miRNAs or control nonspecific
miRNA (Ambion; Thermo Scientific Dharmacon) and 20
nmol/L of Stealth RNAi siRNA for Rictor or control nonspecific
siRNA (Invitrogen) were transfected individually into endometrial cancer cells, using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The
suitable concentration of dsRNAs was decided on the basis
of the result of in vitro cell proliferation assay beforehand.
Representative results of those were shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1A and B. The function-based screening was done by PremiR miRNA Precursor Library-Human V2 (Ambion) in duplicate. The numbers of viable cells were assessed by the
colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay (Cell
counting kit-8; Dojindo Laboratories). Results were normalized to the cell numbers among control cells transfected with
nonspecific miRNA. The cell cycle was evaluated by a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis as described
elsewhere (16).
Methylation analysis
Each gene and CpG island was searched in miRBase database (release April 17, 2011; ref. 17), UCSC Genome Browser on
Human February 2009 Assembly (hg19; ref. 18), and PubMed
(19). Genomic DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and

www.aacrjournals.org

subjected to PCR, using primer sets designed to amplify
regions of interest (Supplementary Table S2). The combined
bisulfite restriction analysis (COBRA) and the bisulfite-sequencing analysis were carried out as described elsewhere (9).
Real-time reverse transcription PCR
Real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was carried
out as described elsewhere (9). Relative expression levels of
miRNAs and a host gene were quantified in comparison with
RNU6B and GAPDH mRNA, respectively.
In vivo analysis of effects of synthetic miRNAs on tumor
growth in SCID mice
Four-week-old female SCID mice were purchased from the
Oriental Yeast Co. Ltd and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. A total of 1.0  107 cells in 100 mL of
Matrigel (BD Biosciences) were injected in the subcutaneous
(s.c.) tissue of the left abdominal wall of 7-week-old SCID mice.
Tumor-bearing SCID mice treated with 1 nmol of dsRNAs
(Ambion) in 100 mL of AteroGene (KOKEN) were administrated into the s.c. spaces around the tumors 3 times every
week from day 14. At the end of the experiment, mice were
sacrificed by cervical dislocation under deep anesthesia, and
the resected s.c. tumors were weighed.
miRNA target predictions, Western blotting, and
luciferase activity assay
Predicted targets for candidate miRNAs and their target
sites were analyzed by using miRanda (20), TargetScan (21),
and PicTar (22).
The protein levels of predicted targets in transfectants were
analyzed by Western blotting, using anti-Akt, anti-phosphoAkt (Ser-473), anti-MET, anti-PCNA, anti-Rictor (Cell Signaling
Technology), anti-E2F3 (Abcam), anti-DNMT1 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) rabbit polyclonal antibodies, and anti-b-actin
monoclonal antibodies (Sigma).
Luciferase constructs were made by ligating oligonucleotides containing the 30 -UTR target sites downstream of
luciferase gene in pMIR-REPORT luciferase vector (Ambion).
Luciferase activities were measured as described elsewhere
(9).
Statistical analysis
Differences between subgroups were tested with the
Mann–Whitney U test.

Results
Function-based screening of TS-miRNAs in endometrial
cancer cell lines
To identify TS-miRNAs silenced by DNA hypermethylation
in endometrial cancer, we first conducted function-based
screening, in which the proliferation-inhibitory effect was
made an index, using HEC-1A cell line and 327 synthetic
miRNAs at 10 nmol/L. The strategy and partial results of this
study are shown in Figure 1A. Relative cell growth ratios in
Figure 1B and Supplementary Table S3 indicate effects of
each miRNA 5 days after transfection. In this first screening,

Methylation and expression analyses of candidates in
endometrial cancer cell lines and primary cases
Next, we explored DNA methylation status of CpG islands
around 32 mature sequences of miRNAs located at 37 loci in a
panel of 13 endometrial cancer cell lines and 6 normal
endometria determined by COBRA (Fig. 1C). As multiple
copies of some mature miRNAs, as listed in Table 1, are
transcribed from different loci, the number of mature forms
of miRNAs is smaller than the number of genomic loci. On the
basis of a comparison of mean methylation frequencies in
each region examined, frequent DNA hypermethylation (>60%
of endometrial cancer lines) was found in only 3 of 32 miRNAs,
that is, miR-9 (96.9%), miR-152 (87.2%), and miR-149 (61.5%),
although a few normal endometria were found to have hypermethylated CpG islands on/around these miRNAs (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Notably, DNA hypermethylation within region 1 in miR-9-1 (1q22), region 1 and 3
in/around miR-9-3 (15q26.1), and region 3 in miR-152
(17q21.32) was observed in all endometrial cancer cell lines.
Therefore, we focused on these 3 miRNAs. We next determined the correlation between the DNA methylation status of
these miRNAs and their expression patterns in 13 endometrial
cancer cell lines and 6 normal endometria. Frequencies of
translational downregulation of miR-9, miR-152, and miR-149
in endometrial cancer cell lines (<0.5-fold expression) were
61.5% (8 of 13), 100% (13 of 13), and 15.4% (2 of 13), respectively
(Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S2C and D), whereas 3 miRNAs
were detected in all normal endometria. Furthermore, the
expressions of miR-9 and miR-152 were also restored by
demethylation with 10 mmol/L 5-aza-dCyd at a high frequency
in endometrial cancer cells lacking their expressions (Fig. 2A;
Supplementary Fig. S2C), strongly suggesting that DNA methylation around CpG islands on miR-9 and miR-152 suppressed
their expressions in endometrial cancer cell lines. Additionally, as shown in Table 2, the downregulation of miR-9,
miR-152, and miR-149 expression correlated with DNA hypermethylation in 61.5% (8 of 13), 100% (13 of 13), and 0% (0 of 9)
of endometrial cancer cell lines, respectively. These findings
indicate that miR-152 is the only miRNA showing a complete
consistency in the correlation between DNA methylation
status and expression pattern in a panel of endometrial
cancer cell lines.
To determine the correlation between DNA methylation
status and expression patterns of miR-152 in 70 primary
endometrial cancer tumors, we carried out COBRA and real-time RT-PCR analysis, respectively. In these analyses, aberrant DNA methylation in region 3 containing pre-miR-152

103 miRNAs, including known TS-miRNAs such as miR-124
(23), miR-126 (24), miR-137 (9), and miR-491 (14), showed
remarkable inhibitory effects on cell growth (relative growth
ratio < 0.5). Then we enrolled miRNAs with CpG islands in
the 50 upstream region and excluded miRNAs previously
reported to show a correlation between DNA hypermethylation and tumor-suppressive activity. Consequently, 32
miRNAs emerged as candidates for new TS-miRNAs silenced
by DNA hypermethylation in endometrial cancer cell lines
(Table 1).

Figure 2. Correlation between methylation and expression status of
miR-152 and its host gene, COPZ2, in endometrial cancer cell lines and
primary cases. A, analysis for miR-152 and COPZ2 in 13 endometrial
cancer cell lines and 6 normal endometria. A map (top) shows miR-152,
COPZ2, CpG island, CpG sites, and PCR products used for COBRA and
bisulfite sequencing. White boxes, exons of COPZ2; black box, pre-miR152; gray box, CpG island; closed arrows, PCR products (primers,
Supplementary Table S2); vertical tick marks, CpG sites; vertical arrows,
restriction enzyme sites. In results of COBRA (middle), arrows,
arrowheads, and black stars indicate unmethylated alleles, methylated
alleles, and samples in which the aberrant hypermethylation of CpG
islands was detected, respectively. In the results of quantitative real-time
RT-PCR (bottom), expression levels of miR-152 and COPZ2 were based
on the amount of target message relative to RNU6B and GAPDH,
respectively, to normalize the initial input of total RNA. Bar graphs show
the ratio of the expression level in each cell line and primary case to the
mean value in 6 normal endometria. Bar graphs for restoration of
expression levels after treatment with 10 mmol/L 5-aza-dCyd for 5 days in
13 endometrial cancer cell lines show the ratio of the expression level in
treated cells to that in untreated cells. White stars indicate endometrial
cancer cell lines in which a remarkable restoration of expression (>2-fold
expression) was observed after treatment with 5-aza-dCyd.

respectively, and consistency in DNA hypermethylation of
region 3 and silencing of miR-152 expression was found in
100.0% (65 of 65) of endometrial cancer cases (Fig. 2B),
whereas such consistencies found in miR-152 were not observed in miR-9 (Table 2; Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).
Moreover, both tumor-specific DNA hypermethylation and
downregulated expression of miR-152 were observed in 66.7%
(2 of 3) of paired samples from primary endometrial cancer
tumors and their corresponding normal endometria (Fig. 2C).

The DNA hypermethylation of this CpG island was also
confirmed by bisulfite sequencing of selected positive cell
lines and cases (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that miR152 is the most likely TS-miRNA frequently silenced through
tumor-specific hypermethylation in endometrial cancer.
Thus, hereafter we focused on miR-152 as a prime candidate.

endometrial cancer cell lines, HEC-1 and HEC-1A, lacking its
expression, in vitro and in vivo. Although miR-152 overexpression significantly inhibited cell growth in vitro, potential dosedependent effects of this dsRNA on cell proliferation in vitro
were not observed in these cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
On the contrary, expression levels of miR-152 were remarkably
increased in endometrial cancer cells transfected with this
dsRNA (<0.005 nmol/L) as compared with untreated endometrial cancer cells and normal endometria (Supplementary
Fig. S1B). Then 2 synthetic miRNAs purchased from Ambion
and Thermo Scientific Dharmacon were used in consideration
of off-target effects of dsRNAs. Consistent with the results of
function-based screening, restoring miR-152 expression significantly reduced cell proliferation in all endometrial cancer
cell lines tested (Fig. 3A), confirming the tumor-suppressive
function of miR-152; note that a large number of miR-152
transfectants were rounded and floating compared with their
control counterparts (Fig. 3A). Because such apoptotic
changes were more remarkable in HEC-1 than HEC-1A under
the phase-contrast microscope at 5 days after transfection, we
carried out FACS analysis and Western blot analysis for
caspase-mediated apoptosis, using endometrial cancer cell
lines 72 hours after the transfection. In FACS analysis, overexpression of miR-152 induced the accumulation of cells in
sub-G1 phase or G2–M phase to HEC-1 or HEC-1A cell lines,
respectively (Fig. 3A). The results of Western blotting, moreover, showed that the ectopic expression of miR-152 remarkably increased levels of caspase-3, cleaved caspase-3, and
cleaved PARP in HEC-1 cells, whereas only caspase-3 was
increased in HEC-1A (Fig. 3B). These findings suggest miR-152
to be associated with cell cycle arrest at both the G1–S and
G2–M checkpoints in endometrial cancer cells, leading us to
further investigate the potential of dsRNA mimicking miR-152
as a therapeutic agent. Therefore, we examined whether
miR-152 could suppress tumor growth in vivo, and consequently significant reduction of s.c. tumors of HEC-1 cells
could be observed by treatment with miR-152 (Fig. 3C).

Coexpression of intronic miRNA, miR-152, and its host
gene, COPZ2
Interestingly, the miR-152 gene is located at 17q21.32 and
within intron 1 of the coatomer protein complex, subunit zeta 2
(COPZ2) gene (Fig. 2A). In real-time PCR analysis using endometrial cancer cell lines and primary cases, the expression
pattern of these 2 transcripts seemed to be similar (Fig. 2A and
B); note that the frequencies of downregulation of COPZ2
in endometrial cancer cell lines and primary cases (<0.5-fold
expression) were 100% (13 of 13) and 75.7% (53 of 70), respectively. The correlation between the DNA methylation status
of COPZ2 in region 3 in COBRA and its expression patterns
was 100% (13 of 13) in endometrial cancer cell lines and 75.4%
(49 of 65) in endometrial cancer cases. To investigate the
relationship between DNA hypermethylation in this CpG island
and the downregulation of miR-152 and COPZ2 expression,
we treated endometrial cancer cell lines with 5-aza-dCyd.
The expression of intronic miR-152 gene and the host gene,
COPZ2, was restored to a similar pattern in endometrial cancer
cell lines 5 days after treatment with 5-aza-dCyd (concordance
rate at 2-fold increased restoration between downregulation
and restoration of COPZ2 expression ¼ 69.2%, 9 of 13; Fig. 2A),
strongly suggesting that DNA methylation around CpG
islands on miR-152 also suppressed the expression of COPZ2
in cell lines. To determine whether COPZ2, as well as miR-152,
had a potent tumor-suppressive function, we also carried out
colony-formation assays using the full coding sequence of
COPZ2 with Myc-tags cloned into a mammalian expression
vector (pCMV-3Tag4A-COPZ2) and 2 endometrial cancer cell
lines lacking the expression of COPZ2 (Supplementary Fig. S4A).
However, the number of large colonies produced by COPZ2transfected HEC-1 cells significantly decreased compared
with those produced by empty vector-transfected counterparts
2 weeks after the transfection and subsequent selection of drugresistant colonies, such findings were not observed in COPZ2transfected HEC-1A cells (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Further
detailed analyses will be necessary to prove that COPZ2 is a TSG.

containing these 30 -UTR target sites downstream of the
luciferase reporter gene. The reporter construct containing
the miR-152 binding site within the 30 -UTR of DNMT1 was
used as a positive control. In endometrial cancer cells
transfected with dsRNAs mimicking miR-152 purchased
from Ambion, a statistically significant reduction in luciferase activity was observed in DNMT1, MET, and Rictor, but

carried out Western blot analysis of these predicted targets
in HEC-1 and HEC-1A cells 48 hours after the transfection of
2 kinds of dsRNAs mimicking miR-152 (Fig. 4A), and observed that protein levels were reduced in the transfectants
compared with their control counterparts, although the
reductions were not remarkable. To further determine
whether the predicted target sites for miR-152 in the 30 UTR of the mRNAs of DNMT1, E2F3, MET, and Rictor

not in their mutant constructs (Fig. 4B), although synthetic
miR-152 purchased from Thermo Scientific Dharmacon
markedly decreased the luciferase activities in all of 4
targets, including E2F3 (Supplementary Fig. S5). On the
contrary, expressions of DNMT1, E2F3, MET, and Rictor were
upregulated in 47.1% (33 of 70), 28.6% (20 of 70), 1.5% (1 of
70), and 20% (14 of 70) of endometrial cancer cases, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). Taken together, these findings suggested that DNMT1 and Rictor might be the most
likely targets for miR-152 in endometrial cancer.
Rictor, together with the mTOR kinase, forms mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), and the Rictor–mTOR complex directly
regulates the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473, resulting in
cell growth (26). To investigate whether Rictor participates in
the growth inhibitory effects of miR-152 in endometrial cancer
cells, we analyzed the phosphorylation of Akt and proliferation
in HEC-1 and HEC-1A cells transfected with or without 2
dsRNAs mimicking miR-152 or 2 specific siRNAs for Rictor.
Levels of Rictor protein and phosphorylation of Akt at Ser-473
were weakly decreased in HEC-1A cells 48 hours after the
transfection of miR-152 compared with those in the control
transfectants, whereas levels of phosphorylated Akt showed
no reduction in HEC-1 cells (Fig. 4C). The transient transfection of specific siRNA for Rictor clearly decreased levels of the
transcripts (data not shown) and protein of Rictor (Fig. 4C)
and inhibited cell growth (Fig. 4D) in both cell lines. Fortyeight hours after the knockdown of Rictor, similar to the
results for miR-152, a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt was detected in HEC-1A cells, but not in HEC-1
cells (Fig. 4C), suggesting Akt to be significantly activated and
phosphorylated by another pathway, for example, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling, different from TORAkt signaling for the silencing of miR-152 through DNA
hypermethylation in HEC-1A cells.

Discussion
In this study, we carried out function-based screening
by using 327 dsRNA mimicking mature human miRNAs as
the first screening of TS-miRNAs having remarkable inhibitory effects on the growth of endometrial cancer cell lines
although expression-based or DNA methylation–based
screening had been successfully performed in our previous
studies in oral squamous cell carcinoma (9) and hepatocellular carcinoma (10). Actually, several known TS-miRNAs,
such as miR-124 (10, 23), miR-126 (27), miR-137 (9), and miR491 (14), were identified through similar screening processes, strongly suggesting the function-based approach presented here to be a powerful tool for exploring dsRNAs
having tumor-suppressive effects, including TS-miRNAs and
siRNAs, as therapeutic agents for several types of cancer
cells. The tumor-suppressive function of a candidate miRNA
eventually identified in our study was reexamined by using
2 kinds of dsRNA purchased from independent companies
to take account of off-target effects by dsRNA. Although such
effects have been known to complicate the interpretation of
phenotypic effects in gene-silencing experiments using
siRNAs (28), dsRNAs mimicking miRNAs can potentially

6460

cause these unwanted actions. These unpredictable target-independent effects should be addressed during data
interpretation in all dsRNA-based studies related with functional genomics, drug target discovery and validation, and
dsRNA therapeutics. However, dsRNAs including miRNAs
and siRNAs have commonly been used so far at 1.0 to
50.0 nmol/L in dsRNA-based studies, remaining the possibility that overexpressions above their physiologic conditions may lead to biologically toxic effects.
We have considered that the hypermethylation of CpG
islands on/around miRNA genes is a good marker to explore
novel epigenetically silenced TS-miRNAs, similar to classic
TSGs in several types of human cancers, and have already
reported miR-137, miR-193a, miR-124, and miR-203 as TSmiRNAs (9, 10). This study showed that the second screening,
combining DNA methylation and expression analyses in endometrial cancer cell lines and primary cases, resulted in the
identification of miR-152 as a prime candidate for a TS-miRNA
silenced by DNA hypermethylation in endometrial cancer.
Because tumor-suppressive effects of miR-152 have not been
described to date, we carried out detailed analyses of miR-152.
Recently, in MLL-rearranged acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
aberrant DNA methylation of miR-152 CpG islands was
reported to correlate with a poor clinical outcome (29).
Altered expression of miR-152 was shown in gastrointestinal
cancer (30) and cholangiocarcinoma (25). Our data showed
that DNA hypermethylation and downregulation of miR-152
were frequently observed in endometrial cancer cell lines and
primary tumors, and that treatment with 5-aza-dCyd restored
the expression of miR-152 in endometrial cancer cell lines
lacking it. In addition, the correlation between DNA methylation status around miR-152 and expression pattern was 100%
(13 of 13) in a panel of 13 endometrial cancer cell lines and
100% (65 of 65) in endometrial cancer cases, suggesting that
DNA hypermethylation around the CpG island of miR-152
seemed to deregulate its expression in endometrial cancer.
Moreover, we successfully showed for the first time that
dsRNA mimicking miR-152, in its administration with atelocollagen for the drug delivery in mice, suppressed in vivo
growth of an endometrial cancer cell line. The finding led us to
consider the possibility that miR-152 might have some benefit
as therapeutic agents. This miRNA is located at 17q21.32 in
intron 1 of the host gene COPZ2. COPZ2 was described as a
coat protein (COP) and to form part of a COPI complex which
transports vesicles from the Golgi apparatus to endoplasmic
reticulum (31). In addition, a recent study showed that COPI
was required for early endosomal maturation in autophagy,
whereas the biological function of COPZ2 remains uncharacterized (32). Our data showed that DNA hypermethylation–
mediated silencing of miR-152 and COPZ2 was a relatively
frequent molecular event in endometrial cancer and inhibited
cell growth in endometrial cancer cell lines, suggesting the
epigenetic silencing of these genes to contribute to endometrial carcinogenesis, although further experiments will be
needed to confirm that the coexpression has tumor suppressor effects in this disease.
In this study, we successfully identified possible direct
targets of miR-152 other than DNMT1 (25), such as E2F3,

Tumor-Suppressive miRNAs in Endometrial Cancer

MET, and Rictor (Supplementary Fig. S7). E2F3 is a transcriptional repressor of the E2F family, and its potential
oncogenic capacity was also shown recently (33). MET is
already well known as an oncogene and the cell-surface
receptor for hepatocyte growth factor (34). These previous
studies as well as our own results suggest that the altered
expression of these targets caused by the downregulation of
miR-152 expression through CpG island hypermethylation
may contribute to the tumorigenesis through the activation
of target oncogenic pathways in endometrial cancer. Rictor
is a component of the mTOR-containing complex, mTORC2,
which directly regulates the phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 (26), and has already been reported the correlation with
the molecular mechanisms in cancer cells (35, 36). These
results including our findings support the hypothesis that
the silencing of miR-152 through CpG methylation may
contribute to carcinogenesis and cancer progression at least
partly through the activation of mTORC2-Akt signaling
in endometrial cancer. However, knockdown of Rictor was
reported to induce G1 arrest in the breast cancer cell line
MCF7 and prostate cancer cell line PC3 (37), and inhibition
of the Akt-mTOR pathway was shown to induce G2–M arrest
and autophagy in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231
(38). On the contrary, we showed here that ectopic miR-152
expression reduced cell proliferation and induced the
accumulation of cells into sub-G1 phase or G2–M phase in
HEC-1 or HEC-1A cell lines, respectively. Cell cycle progression of miR-152 transfectants may be affected by its targets
other than Rictor, considering that miRNAs regulate target
gene expression through imperfect pairing with target messenger RNAs. Although Akt signaling pathways were also
described to play a key role in both G1–S and G2–M transitions (39), these differences in effects on cell cycle progression remain largely unknown.

In conclusion, we describe here the identification of a TSmiRNA, miR-152, frequently silenced by DNA hypermethylation in endometrial cancer, using function-based screening
and a series of sequential analyses. Moreover, we identified
E2F3, MET, and Rictor as potential targets of miR-152, suggesting that the epigenetic silencing of miR-152 and consequent
activation of its multiple targets may contribute to endometrial carcinogenesis, and that miR-152 and targeting E2F3,
MET, and Rictor may provide a novel treatment strategy for
endometrial cancer, although further studies in vivo will be
needed to confirm that dsRNA mimicking miR-152 can work
as a TS-miRNA in this disease.
