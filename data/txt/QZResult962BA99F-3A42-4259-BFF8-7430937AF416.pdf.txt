have been proposed. Since chemotherapeutic drugs target
DNA replication (DNA damaging agents) or mitosis
(mitotic blockers), strategies were aimed to combine
chemotherapy with inhibitors that would halt progression
of normal cells through the cell cycle, making them
drug-resistant during the duration of their arrest [3-6].
In most cancers the regulation of cell cycle progression
is impaired, especially as a result of dysfunctional p53
or retinoblastoma pathway. Therefore, the inhibitors
targeting these pathways cannot effectively stop the
cell cycle of cancer cells and therefore cannot offer
protection to cancer cells. While such strategies, defined
as cyclotherapy [5,6]. have obvious rationale, their
implementation in the clinic was difficult, being delayed
by the need for extensive clinical trials of the cell cycle
inhibitors (e.g. inhibitors of Cdks) as some of them may
show toxicity. Furthermore, a highly balanced equilibrium
between the protective- versus chemotherapeutic- agents,
both in terms of their respective concentrations as well
as the sequence of and length of administration, must be
tested to achieve successful clinical application.
In the current article in Oncotarget, Apontes et al
[7] describe advances that move forward the potential
clinical applications of cyclotherapy. The authors used
mitotic inhibitors, paclitaxel and nocodazole as the
chemotherapeutic agents designed to kill cancer cells.
The strategy of normal cells protection relied on the use of
either non-genotoxic inducer of p53, nutlin-3a (N-3a), the
inhibitor of mTOR pathway rapamycin (RAPA), or the
widely prescribed anti-diabetic drug, possibly affecting
IGF-1 signaling, metformin (MF), each tested alone
and in combination. Their data are very encouraging.
Specifically, the authors have seen that N-3a, RAPA or
MF, particularly when applied in combinations, halted
cell cycle progression of the three normal human cell
lines cells, arresting them reversibly in G1 and/or G2 and
thereby protecting from the toxicity of mitotic inhibitors.
No such arrest was observed in the case of breast cancer
MDA-MB-231 cells having mutant p53. Of importance
was the observation that the arrest of normal cells was
achieved: (i) for the duration equivalent of the time

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the most
effective anticancer modalities. However the effectiveness
of chemotherapy, which targets DNA replication and
mitosis, is limited by the side effects resulting from
killing normal cells that proliferate. The discovery of
molecular abnormities associated with neoplastic growth
stimulated attempts to develop targeted therapies aimed
at selectively inhibiting growth of cancer by interfering
with specific molecules or signal transduction pathways
that are over-expressed (overactive) in cancer cells. It
was anticipated that targeted cancer therapies would be
more effective than current treatments and less harmful to
normal cells [1]. Imatinib mesylate (Gleevec, STI–571),
the drug developed to treat Philadelphia chromosome
positive CML, exemplifies the first successful application
of targeted therapy [2].The success, however, is due
to the fact that the target (Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase)
fulfils two criteria: (i) is unique to this leukemia and
not present in normal cells, and (ii) is essential for cell
growth. Most other tumors do not express such unique
features and therefore targeted treatments, especially of
patients with most common solid tumors, has been less
successful and is frequently disappointing [3]. This is not
surprising because the target is usually the component
of a cell signaling pathway that, while over-expressed in
cancer, is essential for the survival of cancer as well as
normal cells. For example, if a cancer cell has e.g. 107
- and normal cell 103 – such cell signaling molecules,
the treatment with the targeting inhibitor that inactivates
99.99% of these molecules will completely deplete the
normal cells but leave the cancer cells still with 103
molecules. Thus, although the initial cancer response to
the inhibitor may be quite dramatic, the escalation of dose
and treatment duration is expected to lead to preferential
killing of normal rather than cancer cells. Given the
above, chemo- and radiotherapy are likely to remain the
major therapeutic approaches in the armamentarium of
oncologist for the near future.
As mentioned, the side effects of chemotherapy limit
its effectiveness. To overcome this limitation strategies

interval during which the treatment of cancer cells with
mitotic inhibitors (3 days) eliminated their capability
to proliferate (assessed 6 days later); and (ii) the arrest
was to a large degree reversible and showed no evident
toxicity. The maximal protective effects were seen in drug
combinations such as N-3a+RAPA, N-3a+RAPA+MF, or
RAPA+MF. Of further interest was the observation that
while the protective effect of RAPA+MF for normal cells
was seen at the reduced concentration of glucose such
conditions were actually cytotoxic for cancer cells. The
authors offer specific recommendations on timing and
sequence of administration of protective agents versus
mitotic inhibitors in treatment of cancer.
Several implications advancing clinical use of
cyclotherapy stem from the findings of Apontes et al.7
One is that the protective agents MF and RAPA, albeit
for different applications, are already widely used in the
clinic. Therefore their toxicity and pharmacokinetics are
well characterized. N-3a, while not advanced in clinical
trials, appears to be mimicked in terms of its ability to
activate p53, by low concentrations of actinomycin
D [6,8], the drug whose clinical application is also
recognized. The agents that can be used to protect normal
cells thus have been already clinically tested. Another
observation of clinical importance stems from the use
of metformin. While metformin was shown to have the
property to protect normal cells it also has antineoplastic
activity against prostate,[9] breast [10] and other cancers
[11]. Application of MF+RAPA, perhaps combined with
fasting [12] or with 2-deoxyglucose [12] (2-DG) to reduce
glucose utilization (2-DG is also well characterized for
clinical use) may provide concurrently the protection of
normal cells and the antineoplastic activity.
The advantage of cyclotherapy stems from the fact that
response of normal cells to the protective agents targeting
their signaling and metabolic pathways, which are well
characterized, is predictable. In contrast, targeting cancer
is uncertain since many of the pathways, often different
in various cancers, are dysfunctional. Furthermore, even
personalized targeting, after identification of the defective
pathways of a given cancer, may be inadequate because
of changes that may occur due to tumor progression, in
the time interval between tumor sampling and its full
characterization.
