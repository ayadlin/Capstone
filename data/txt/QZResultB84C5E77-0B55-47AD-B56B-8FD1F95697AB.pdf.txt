Abstract
Epidemiologic studies show that patients chronically consuming nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) for arthritis exhibit a reduced incidence of prostate cancer. In addition,
some NSAIDs show anticancer activity in vitro. NSAIDs
exert their anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity; however, evidence suggests that
COX-independent mechanisms mediate decreased prostate
cancer cell survival. Hence, we examined the effect of selected
aryl propionic acid NSAIDs and structurally related compounds on the decreased survival of prostate cancer cell lines
PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP by induction of the p75NTR protein.
p75NTR has been shown to function as a tumor suppressor in
the prostate by virtue of its intracellular death domain that
can initiate apoptosis and inhibit growth. The most efficacious
compounds for induction of p75NTR and decreased survival, in
rank-order, were R-flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, oxaprozin, fenoprofen, naproxen, and ketoprofen. Because R-flurbiprofen and
ibuprofen exhibited the greatest efficacy, we examined their
dose-dependent specificity of induction for p75NTR relative to
other members of the death receptor family. Whereas
treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen resulted in a
massive induction of p75NTR protein levels, the expression of
Fas, p55TNFR , DR3, DR4, DR5, and DR6 remained largely
unchanged. Moreover, transfection of either cell line before Rflurbiprofen or ibuprofen treatment with a dominant negative
form of p75NTR to antagonize p75NTR activity or p75NTR small
interfering RNA to prevent p75NTR protein expression rescued
both cell lines from decreased survival. Hence, R-flurbiprofen
and ibuprofen selectively induce p75NTR-dependent decreased
survival of prostate cancer cells independently of COX
inhibition. [Cancer Res 2007;67(7):3254–62]

Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and
ranks as the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among
men in the United States (1, 2). Recent epidemiologic studies found
a correlation between long-term nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) use and decreased prostate cancer risk (3–6). In
addition, many in vitro studies involving various human prostate
cancer cell lines consistently show decreased proliferation and
increased apoptosis in response to select NSAID treatment (7, 8).
NSAIDs exert their anti-inflammatory activity by inhibiting cyclo-

oxygenase (COX), the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of
arachidonic acid to prostaglandins. Two isoforms of COX exist;
COX-1 is a housekeeping gene that is constitutively expressed at
low levels in most cells types, whereas COX-2 is highly inducible in
response to cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. COX-2 seems
to play a significant role in the promotion of colon cancer with 50%
of precancerous adenomatous polyps and 85% of colon carcinomas
exhibiting COX-2 overexpression (9). However, the data pertaining
to the role of COX-2 in prostate cancer are less conclusive.
Although some studies show overexpression, others show expression is low or absent relative to normal tissue (10–14). In addition,
there is not a consensus regarding the status of COX-2 expression
in established prostate cancer cell lines, including LNCaP, DU-145,
and PC-3 (13, 15–17). However, regardless of COX-2 expression,
these cell lines all show susceptibility to select NSAID treatment
(17–19). Furthermore, the anticancer activity of NSAIDs occurs at
concentrations several orders of magnitude higher than those
required to inhibit COX-2, and different NSAIDs show varying levels
of anticancer activity (20–22). These results suggest the existence of
a COX-independent mechanism by which some NSAIDs initiate
apoptosis and inhibit proliferation.
The p75NTR (neurotrophin receptor) is a member of the tumor
necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily capable of inducing
apoptosis through a conserved intracellular death domain (23, 24).
It binds neurotrophin ligands with similar affinity; however, unlike
other members of the TNFR superfamily, p75NTR induces cell death
and suppresses growth in the unbound state (25–29). Recently,
p75NTR was identified as a tumor and metastasis suppressor in the
prostate and bladder (27, 28). Although normal prostate epithelial
cells express high levels of p75NTR , this expression becomes
suppressed as prostate cancer progresses (30). In addition, the
human prostate cancer cell lines PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP, all
derived from metastases, show little to no p75NTR expression (31).
However, the p75NTR gene in these cells has remained intact,
indicating that the potential for up-regulation may exist (31).
Furthermore, exogenous reexpression of p75NTR in PC-3 cells
suppressed growth and increased apoptosis (28, 32). This suggests
potential for treatments that result in the up-regulation and reexpression of p75NTR in prostate cancer cells.
Ibuprofen and flurbiprofen belong to the aryl propionic acid
class of NSAIDs. Treatment of T24 bladder cancer cells and
HCT-116 colon cancer cells with ibuprofen or the enantiomer
R-flurbiprofen, which lacks COX inhibitory activity, induced a dosedependent up-regulation of p75NTR and a corresponding decrease
in survival (33). Rescue experiments involving transfection of
dominant negative forms of p75NTR before ibuprofen treatment of
T24 cells showed that the observed induction of p75NTR was causal
of the decreased survival (33). Significantly, R-flurbiprofen treatment of TRAMP mice has been shown to lower the incidence of
primary tumors and metastases of prostate cancer (34). In this
context, we show that R -flurbiprofen and ibuprofen most

effectively up-regulate p75NTR expression in both PC-3 and DU-145
cell lines relative to other aryl propionic acids. This up-regulation
occurs in a dose-dependent manner and corresponds to a decrease
in cell survival. The use of p75NTR dominant negatives and p75NTRtargeting small interfering RNA (siRNA) shows that the observed
decreased survival is directly mediated through p75NTR , a COXindependent mechanism.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and culture conditions. PC-3 and DU-145 cell lines were
obtained from the tissue culture core facility of the Georgetown University
Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center. LNCaP cells were obtained from
the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were

(Sigma). The supernatant was retained, and protein concentration was
determined according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). For long-term treatment of cells, f1000 cells were
seeded overnight and treated the next day with 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and
0.5 mmol/L ibuprofen or R-flurbiprofen twice per week for 2 weeks. After
2 weeks, lysates were prepared as described above, or cells were trypsinized,
resuspended, and counted using a hemocytometer.
Immunoblot analysis. Immunoblot analysis was done by loading 50 Ag
of protein onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels for electrophoresis, followed
by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech,
Piscataway, NJ). Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk (Bio-Rad
Laboratories) and then incubated in the primary antibody: murine
monoclonal anti-p75NTR (1:2,000, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Lake
Placid, NY), murine monoclonal anti-Fas (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies,
Santa Cruz, CA), murine monoclonal anti-p55TNFR (1:100, Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies), rat polyclonal anti-DR3 (1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), murine monoclonal anti-DR4 (1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), rat
polyclonal anti-DR5 (1:500, ProSci Inc., Poway, CA), rat polyclonal anti-DR6
(2 Ag/mL; Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions), mouse monoclonal anti–COX-1
(1:200, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), goat polyclonal anti–COX-2 (1:200,
Santa Cruz Biotechnologies), or murine monoclonal anti–h-actin (1:5000,
Sigma). Following incubation in the primary antibody, membranes were
incubated in the appropriate horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary
antibody (1:3,000, Bio-Rad Laboratories). Immunoreactivity was detected
using the chemiluminescence detection reagent (Amersham Pharmacia
Biotech). Several positive controls were used: A875 whole cell lysate (WCL;
Tissue Culture Core Facility, Georgetown University) for p75NTR, A431 WCL
(Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for Fas, MCF-7 WCL (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for p55TNFR , Jurkat WCL (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) for DR3

and DR6, HeLa WCL (ProSci Inc.) for DR4 and DR5, U-937 WCL (Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies) for COX-1, and RAW 264.7 WCL (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) for COX-2.
Reverse transcription-PCR. PC-3 and DU145 cells were treated with 2.0
mmol/L R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen. RNA was isolated following 0, 2, 4, 8,
12, 18, and 24 h of treatment using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Reverse transcription-PCR
(RT-PCR) was done using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with
Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) using 250 ng RNA for p75NTR
and 125 ng RNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH).
Primers were designed using Primer Quest, and their sequences are as
follows: p75NTR forward 5¶-AGG TGA CCT TCT GGG AAA TGG CTT-3¶,
p75NTR reverse 5¶-ATT TCC TCC GAT GCT TCT CTG GCA-3¶, GAPDH
forward 5¶-CCA CCC ATG GCA AAT TCC ATG GCA-3¶, and GAPDH reverse
5¶-TCT AGA CGG CAG GTC AGG TCC ACC-3¶ (Integrated DNA
Technologies, Coralville, IA). cDNA synthesis was done at 47jC for 30 min
followed by denaturation at 94jC for 2 min and then 30 cycles of PCR at
94jC for 1 min, 60jC for 1 min, and 72jC for 1 min, with final extension at
72jC for 5 min. PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gels.
Hoechst dye nuclear (DNA) staining. Hoechst staining to identify
apoptotic nuclei was conducted as described previously (33). PC-3, DU-145,
and LNCaP cells were treated for 48 h with aryl propionic acids and then
fixed in 10% formalin (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Cells
were collected, washed in PBS, centrifuged, resuspended in PBS, and dried
on slides. Slides were rehydrated with PBS, washed with distilled water, and
covered with a 1:1,000 aqueous dilution of Hoechst 33258 stain (Molecular
Probes, Eugene, OR) for a final concentration of 10 Ag/mL. After 10 min,
slides were washed with distilled water, mounted, and viewed using a
fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axioplan 2 Imaging, Jena, Germany).

R-Flurbiprofen–Induced p75NTR-Dependent Decreased Survival
p75NTR dominant negative transfection. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were
transiently transfected with one of two p75NTR dominant negative vectors
described previously (35). The DDD vector expresses p75NTR with the death
domain deleted, and the DICD vector expresses p75NTR with the slightly
larger intracellular domain deleted. Both are ecdysone-inducible p75NTR
vectors and, therefore, were each cotransfected with the ecdysone receptor
plasmid pVgRxR. The transfection was done with LipofectAMINE reagent
(Invitrogen) in serum-free medium for 6 h, after which serum-containing
medium was added. After 18 subsequent hours, cells were incubated in 1
Amol/L ponasterone A (Invitrogen) for 24 h to drive the expression of the
dominant negative gene products. Following incubation with ponasterone
A, cells were treated with aryl propionic acids for 48 h, and relative cell
survival was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN).
siRNA transfection. PC-3 and DU-145 cells were transfected for 24 h with
nontargeting or p75NTR-specific siRNA [Dharmacon RNA Technologies
(Duplex D-009340-03), Lafayette, CO] at a final concentration of 100 nmol/L
according to the manufacturer’s protocol using transfection reagents
DharmaFECT 1 for DU-145 cells and DharmaFECT 2 (Dharmacon RNA
Technologies) for PC-3 cells. After transfection, the cells were treated with
aryl propionic acids for 48 h, followed by determination of p75NTR protein
expression or relative cell survival by MTT assay (Roche Applied Science).

Results
Aryl propionic acids selectively induce p75NTR expression
and decrease cell survival. We examined the ability of Rflurbiprofen and ibuprofen, as well as four other members of the
aryl propionic acid family, including oxaprozin, fenoprofen,
naproxen, and ketoprofen to induce the expression of p75NTR
protein in PC-3 and DU-145 human prostate cancer cells. In both
cell lines, R-flurbiprofen was the most efficacious for the induction
of p75NTR expression followed by ibuprofen, oxaprozin, fenoprofen,
naproxen, and finally, ketoprofen, which was the least effective
compound (Fig. 1A). For subsequent experiments, only R flurbiprofen and ibuprofen were used because they were the most
effective of the six aryl propionic acids tested. Treatment with Rflurbiprofen or ibuprofen also resulted in an induction of p75NTR in
LNCaP cells, which are androgen responsive (Fig. 1B). To elucidate
the mechanism by which these aryl propionic acids may be
inducing p75NTR protein expression, we determined relative p75NTR
mRNA levels at various time points following 2.0 mmol/L Rflurbiprofen or ibuprofen treatment (Fig. 1C). In both cell lines, Rflurbiprofen and ibuprofen significantly induced p75NTR message
level. This induction is first noticeable within 4 h of treatment in
both cell lines with both drugs.
The aryl propionic acids are commonly used as NSAIDs that act
through COX inhibition. Therefore, we examined the status of COX
expression in both cell lines and determined whether the
expression level of either isoform changed in response to treatment
with R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen (Fig. 1D). Both PC-3 and DU-145
cells expressed COX-1 at low levels, and expression remained
unchanged following R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen treatment. PC-3
cells lacked COX-2 expression; however, expression was induced
upon treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen. DU-145 cells also
lacked COX-2 expression, and no induction was observed following
treatment with either compound.
Examination of the effect of R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen on
survival of PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP cells after 48-h treatment
resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in survival that corresponded with the observed induction of p75NTR (Fig. 2A and B).
Again, R -flurbiprofen was more efficacious than ibuprofen,
resulting in a greater dose-dependent decrease in survival. Because

immunoblot analysis using monoclonal antibodies to human Fas, p55TNFR, and
DR4, or rat polyclonal antibodies to human DR3, DR5, and DR6, and h-actin
as the loading control. A431, MCF-7, Jurkat, and HeLa cell lysates were used
as positive controls for Fas, p55TNFR, DR3 and DR6, and DR4 and DR5,
respectively.

p75NTR contains an intracellular death domain capable of initiating
apoptosis, we used Hoechst staining to identify fragmented nuclei
typical of apoptotic cells. Treatment with 2.0 mmol/L R flurbiprofen or ibuprofen resulted in an induction of apoptotic
cells, indicating that apoptosis was at least partially responsible for
the observed decrease in survival (Fig. 2C and D).
p75NTR is a member of the TNFR superfamily whose members
contain an intracellular death domain capable of inducing
apoptosis (23, 24). Although 48-h treatment with R-flurbiprofen
resulted in a substantial dose-dependent induction of p75NTR , the
other death receptors, including Fas, p55TNFR , DR3, DR4, DR5, and
DR6, showed little, if any, induction in PC-3 cells (Fig. 3A). Similar
results were observed following treatment with ibuprofen (Fig. 3B).
There seemed to be a slight induction of DR4 with ibuprofen;
however, the magnitude of the response was small relative to the
induction observed for p75NTR expression (Fig. 3B). The addition of
the ligand corresponding to each death receptor had no effect on
the induction of death receptors by R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen
(data not shown). Therefore, R -flurbiprofen and ibuprofen
selectively induced p75NTR , whereas protein expression of the
other TNFR family members remained largely unchanged.

Long-term R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen treatment results
in p75NTR induction and decreased survival at lower drug
concentrations. Epidemiologic studies have shown a correlation
between long-term continuous NSAID use and a decreased risk of
prostate cancer (3, 4). Therefore, we examined whether chronic
treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen for 2 weeks at lower
concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 mmol/L may be equally
effective or more effective than the 48-h acute treatment at higher
concentrations in PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Long-term treatment
with R-flurbiprofen resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in cell
growth with severe growth arrest even at 0.1 mmol/L and almost
a complete loss of growth at 0.3 mmol/L for PC-3 cells and
0.5 mmol/L for DU-145 cells (Fig. 4A). In addition, there was a
dose-dependent increase in p75NTR levels beginning at 0.1 mmol/L,
which corresponds to the concentration at which decreased growth
first occurred (Fig. 4B). Similarly, long-term treatment with
ibuprofen resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in survival and
induction of p75NTR at lower concentrations than observed with
48-h ibuprofen treatment, but was not as efficacious as long-term
treatment with R-flurbiprofen (Fig. 4C and D).
Decreased survival caused by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen is
mediated through p75NTR. The results presented thus far show
that the induction of p75NTR is associated with decreased survival of
PC-3 and DU-145 cells in response to R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen
treatment. To determine if the observed decreased survival is
causally mediated through R-flurbiprofen– and ibuprofen-dependent induction of p75NTR , ponasterone A–inducible expression
vectors for one of two different dominant negative forms of p75NTR
were transfected into PC-3 and DU-145 cells before R-flurbiprofen
or ibuprofen treatment. The dominant negative vectors both express
truncated forms of p75NTR. DDDp75NTR has a deletion of the death

domain, and DICDp75NTR has a deletion of the larger intracellular
domain that includes the death domain. PC-3 and DU-145 cells
treated with 0, 0.5, or 1.0 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen alone or with
ponasterone A resulted in a similar dose-dependent decrease in
survival (Fig. 5A and B). R-flurbiprofen treatment of cells transfected
with either DDDp75NTR or DICDp75NTR but not treated with
ponasterone A yielded the same result (Fig. 5A and B). However,
cells transfected with either of the two dominant negative expression
vectors followed by ponasterone A treatment to induce expression of
the gene product exhibited increased survival following R-flurbiprofen treatment compared with cells not expressing dominant
negative p75NTR (Fig. 5A and B). Similar results were observed with
ibuprofen in PC-3 and DU-145 cells, where expression of the
dominant negative forms of p75NTR partially prevented decreased
survival due to ibuprofen (Fig. 5C and D).
We did similar rescue experiments using siRNA targeted against
p75NTR. Transfection of PC-3 cells with p75NTR siRNA before
R-flurbiprofen treatment almost completely prevented the induction of p75NTR protein, whereas transfection with nontargeting
siRNA did not prevent the induction of p75NTR protein (Fig. 6A).
Treatment with R-flurbiprofen at 0, 0.5, and 1.0 mmol/L in
untransfected PC-3 cells or in PC-3 cells transfected with
nontargeting siRNA resulted in a similar dose-dependent decrease
in cell viability (Fig. 6A). However, treatment of PC-3 cells transfected with p75NTR siRNA partially prevented R-flurbiprofen–
dependent decreased survival at 0.5 and 1.0 mmol/L concentrations (Fig. 6A). Similarly, transfection of PC-3 or DU-145 cells
with p75NTR-targeting siRNA before ibuprofen treatment also
almost completely blocked the induction of p75NTR, whereas
transfection with nontargeting siRNA did not block induction
(Fig. 6C and D). Treatment with 0, 0.5, and 1.0 mmol/L ibuprofen

R-Flurbiprofen–Induced p75NTR-Dependent Decreased Survival

Figure 5. A to D, PC-3 and DU-145 cell survival analysis by MTT assay following 48-h treatment with 0, 0.5, or 1.0 mmol/L R -flurbiprofen or ibuprofen. Before
treatment, cells were cotransfected for 6 h in serum-free medium with ponasterone A–inducible ecdysone receptor plasmid pVgRxR and either DDDp75NTR or
DICDp75NTR, which express a truncated dominant negative p75NTR protein that lacks either the death domain or the entire intracellular domain, respectively. Following
transfection, cells were incubated in serum-containing medium for 18 h and then incubated in 1 Amol/L ponasterone A (P) for 24 h to drive expression of the dominant
negative gene products. Columns, mean relative to the control (0 mM); bars, SE. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001.

led to a dose-dependent decrease of cell survival in untransfected
cells and in cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA, whereas
transfection with p75NTR siRNA before ibuprofen treatment
prevented a decrease in survival at the 1.0 mmol/L concentration
(Fig. 6C and D). Transfection of DU-145 cells with p75NTR-targeting
siRNA only partially prevented p75NTR induction upon R-flurbiprofen treatment (Fig. 6B). Consistently, only a partial rescue from
R-flurbiprofen–dependent decreased survival was observed in
these cells.

Discussion
The profens, also referred to as 2-aryl propionic acid derivatives,
are a class of NSAIDs that share several characteristics. They can be
reversible inhibitors of COX, are highly bound to plasma albumin,
and are weak acids (36). They exist as enantiomer pairs, and it is
generally the S-enantiomer, but not the R -enantiomer, that
possesses potent COX inhibitory activity (37). Some profens have
been in use for roughly 30 years, most commonly as treatment for
inflammation due to rheumatoid arthritis (38–43). However, based
on emerging studies associating NSAIDs with anticancer activity,
various profens have been examined for their efficacy as chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents in a variety of cancer types
(44–46). In this study, we examined the ability of six profens,

roxen, and ketoprofen, to induce the expression of the p75NTR tumor
suppressor in prostate cancer cells. We observed a dose-dependent
induction of p75NTR by these drugs; however, the level of efficacy
varied with R-flurbiprofen followed by ibuprofen as the most
effective. Consistently, previous reports identify these two drugs as
promising agents in prostate cancer treatment. R-flurbiprofen was
shown to inhibit the progression of prostate cancer in the TRAMP
mouse, whereas ibuprofen was shown to reduce survival of LNCaP
and DU-145 human prostate cancer cells (8, 21, 34). In addition,
treatment of the human colon cancer COX-null cell line HCT-116
with either of these drugs resulted in reduced cell survival,
indicating that these drugs possess the ability to inhibit growth
through a COX-independent mechanism (33). The remaining four
profens induced p75NTR to a lesser degree with oxaprozin as the
next most effective followed by fenoprofen, naproxen, and
ketoprofen as the least effective. Of these four drugs, naproxen
has also been shown to suppress growth of prostate cancer cells;
however, it was less effective when compared with ibuprofen (21).
The results showed that an induction of p75NTR was associated
with significantly decreased survival of PC-3, DU-145, and LNCaP
cells. Although these cell lines exhibited low levels of p75NTR
expression at lower concentrations of R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen, the levels of p75NTR were below the threshold for decreased
survival. As the concentration of R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen
increased, some variability between levels of p75NTR and decreased

survival may have resulted from discordance around inflection
points. At higher concentrations of R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen,
levels of p75NTR were concordant with decreased survival. This
cause and effect relationship between higher levels of p75NTR and
decreased survival was subsequently shown in the rescue experiments with dominant negatives and siRNA to p75NTR.
The exact mechanism by which R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen
induce p75NTR protein expression remains under investigation.
However, an examination of p75NTR mRNA levels by RT-PCR at
various time points showed that treatment of PC-3 and DU-145
cells with 2.0 mmol/L R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen resulted in a
relatively strong induction of p75NTR mRNA in all cases within
4 h and continuing until between 8 and 12 h, after which p75NTR
mRNA remained constant. These results suggest that the observed
induction of p75NTR protein expression is a result of an increase in
p75NTR mRNA. This may occur by an increase in mRNA stability
because previous work showed that p75NTR protein expression is
lost in prostate cancer cell lines due to increased mRNA instability

that is mediated through the 3¶ untranslated region (31). Therefore,
it is possible that treatment with R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen
alleviates this instability.
COX-2 catalyzes the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, which are associated with increased survival, decreased
apoptosis, and promotion of angiogenesis (13). Hence, inhibition of
COX-2 has been suggested as a mechanism by which NSAIDs
decrease cancer cell survival. However, an increasing body of
literature suggests that many NSAIDs act through a COXindependent mechanism to achieve anticancer activity in the
prostate (13). To elucidate whether COX plays a role in aryl
propionic acid–dependent decreased prostate cancer cell survival,
we examined the status of COX-1 and COX-2 expression. As
expected, the housekeeping isoform COX-1 was expressed at low
levels in PC-3 and DU-145 cells, and neither R-flurbiprofen nor
ibuprofen induced its expression. Because COX-1 is not overexpressed in prostate cancer, is not generally associated with tumor
development, and was minimally expressed in both cell lines at a

R-Flurbiprofen–Induced p75NTR-Dependent Decreased Survival

constant level, it seems that R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen inhibited
survival through a mechanism other than COX-1 inhibition. DU-145
cells lacked any COX-2 expression, whereas PC-3 cells only
exhibited expression upon R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen treatment.
An induction of COX-2 following NSAID treatment has been
observed previously in PC-3 cells, as well as several other cell types
(47–49). Although ibuprofen treatment led to an up-regulation of
COX-2, the effect would be negated because ibuprofen would
inhibit COX-2 activity. Because R-flurbiprofen lacks COX inhibitory
activity, COX-2 could potentially remain active upon induction by
R-flurbiprofen. However, 48-h R-flurbiprofen treatment of PC-3
cells was more potent for decreased survival than R-flurbiprofen in
DU-145 cells, as well as more potent than ibuprofen treatment in
both PC-3 and DU-145 cells. Therefore, there is no evidence that an
induction of COX-2 in PC-3 cells promotes survival or reduces the
effect of R-flurbiprofen treatment. Indeed, induction of COX-2 in
PC-3 cells was associated with the greatest decrease in cell survival.
This further supports the hypothesis that these drugs act as
anticancer agents independently of COX-2.
p75NTR belongs to the TNFR superfamily, which includes Fas,
p55TNFR, DR3, DR4, DR5, and DR6 (35). These receptors initiate
instructive apoptosis through a homologous intracellular death
domain (50). With the exception of p75NTR, they induce apoptosis
upon ligand binding (51). In contrast, p75NTR initiates apoptosis and
suppresses growth in a ligand-independent manner in prostate and
bladder cancer cells (26–29). Previous studies show that some NSAIDs
up-regulate expression of various death receptors (52, 53). To
eliminate the possibility that the observed decrease in survival was
due to apoptosis initiated by another member of the TNFR family, we
examined expression of the remaining six family members in PC-3
cells following R-flurbiprofen or ibuprofen treatment. Neither p55TNFR
nor DR6 were detected with or without treatment. Fas and DR5 were
weakly expressed and remained constant upon treatment. DR3
expression was stronger than the other family members, but weak
relative to p75NTR, and remained constant following treatment. DR4
seems slightly up-regulated by ibuprofen; however, its expression
levels were minimal relative to the robust induction of p75NTR. Similar
results were observed in the presence of the appropriate ligand for
each receptor. Therefore, other than p75NTR, the death receptors
capable of initiating apoptosis do not seem to play a significant role in
the decreased survival caused by R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen
treatment of PC-3 and DU-145 prostate cancer cells.
It seems that R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen decrease survival of
PC-3 and DU-145 cells by a COX-independent mechanism. p75NTR is
the only TNFR superfamily member significantly up-regulated by
treatment with aryl propionic acids, and its up-regulation is
associated with decreased survival in both cell lines. This suggests

p75NTR induction as a COX-independent mechanism initiating the
observed decrease in survival. Hence, three different approaches
including p75NTR -targeting siRNA and two different p75NTR
dominant negatives were used to examine a causal relationship
between p75NTR levels and decreased cell survival. Each method
increased survival of PC-3 and DU-145 cells treated with Rflurbiprofen or ibuprofen relative to untransfected cells. Collectively,
these results provide strong evidence that p75NTR is at least partially
causal of the decreased survival due to treatment with R flurbiprofen or ibuprofen.
Because chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic drugs are often
administered chronically, we examined whether long-term treatment enabled R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen to maintain their
anticancer activity at lower concentrations than observed with
acute treatments (48 h). Both R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen were
highly effective in inducing p75NTR and reducing growth at lower
concentrations after chronic treatment. In particular, long-term Rflurbiprofen treatment at the lowest concentration of 0.1 mmol/L
exhibited an 85% reduction of growth relative to the control and
essentially total loss of growth at concentrations of 0.3 mmol/L or
greater in PC-3 cells. Likewise, in DU-145 cells, 0.1 mmol/L longterm R-flurbiprofen treatment resulted in 66% reduction of growth
and almost a total loss of growth at 0.5 mmol/L treatment. This
dramatic loss of growth also correlates with the induction of
p75NTR , which occurred in a dose-dependent manner starting at
0.1 mmol/L. Similarly, ibuprofen exhibited a substantial loss of
growth due to chronic treatment at lower concentrations relative
to acute 48-h treatment at higher concentrations in both PC-3 and
DU-145 cells. The results of the chronic treatment experiments
are especially significant because they indicate that these drugs,
especially R-flurbiprofen, could be highly effective in inhibiting
prostate cancer growth at clinically achievable concentrations with
long-term use. In clinical trials, R-flurbiprofen and ibuprofen have
been given at doses that result in plasma concentrations of 0.14
and 0.48 mmol/L, respectively (54). These concentrations are within
the range of concentrations used in our chronic study. Hence, the
data collectively demonstrate the activity of R-flurbiprofen and
ibuprofen as anticancer agents in the prostate and convincingly
implicate p75NTR induction as a COX-independent mechanism by
which this anticancer activity is achieved.
