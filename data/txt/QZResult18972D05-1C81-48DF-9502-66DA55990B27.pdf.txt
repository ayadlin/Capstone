ABSTRACT
Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathways are frequently activated in
cancer cells due to mutations of RTKs and/or their downstream signaling proteins
such as KRAS and BRAF. About 40% colorectal cancers (CRCs) contain KRAS or BRAF
mutant genes and are resistant to treatments with individual inhibitors of RTKs,
AKT, MEK, or BRAF. Therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms of
the drug resistance is necessary for developing effective strategies to treat the
diseases. Here we report the discovery of an AKT/ERK reactivation mechanism that
account for the cancer cell resistance to the AKT and MEK inhibitors treatments. The
reactivations of AKT and ERK after the AKT or MEK inhibitor treatment were caused
by a relief of an AKT or ERK-mediated feedback inhibition of the RTKs and/or their
downstream pathways. A combination of RTK inhibitors, based on the RTK activation/
phosphorylation profile, synergized with the AKT inhibitor, but not the MEK inhibitor,
to completely inhibit the AKT phosphorylation and to block the growth of KRAS/BRAF
mutant CRC cells. These results underscored the importance of AKT and the AKT
feedback signaling to cancer cell growth and offered a novel therapeutic approach
for the treatment of KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells.

INTRODUCTION

[9, 15], most cancer cells are resistant to the single
inhibitor treatments [16–20].
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common
cancer and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths
worldwide [21–23]. So far, there have been only two
types of targeted therapies approved for CRC treatments,
an anti-angiogenesis therapy and an anti-EGFR therapy.
Cetuximab and panitumumab, two antibodies against
EGFR, can only prolong survival of colorectal cancer
patients with normal KRAS [24]. However, the data in
the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC)
indicate that 41.6% (2463 of 5926) of the CRC patients
contain KRAS or BRAF mutant genes [25, 26], suggesting
that a large population of CRC patients can not profit from
the anti-EGFR treatment and new therapeutic strategies
are urgently needed.
In this study, we investigated the drug resistance
mechanisms of the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cells
and explored new strategies to target the RTK signaling
pathways for the treatment of the CRC cells. We found

Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) signaling
pathways are the major pathways in regulating cell
proliferation, differentiation, and survival [1, 2]. The RTKs
are activated by growth factors and transduce signals
through two distinct downstream pathways: the mitogenactivated protein kinase kinase (MEK)/extracellular
signaling-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway and the
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B
(AKT) pathway [3–5]. These two pathways are frequently
activated in cancer cells due to aberrant activation of RTKs
and/or activating mutations in their downstream signaling
molecules such as KRAS and BRAF [6–9]. Specific RTK
inhibitors (RTKis) have been used for the treatment of
certain cancers with RTK activations [10–12]. However,
therapeutic efficacies are low in most cancers with KRAS
or BRAF mutations [13, 14]. Although inhibitors of the
downstream effectors such as RAF and MEK exhibit good
therapeutic efficacies in BRAF mutant melanoma cells

that AKT inhibitors (AKTi) and MEK inhibitors (MEKi)
individually or in combination were not sufficient to
inhibit the growth of the KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC
cells. A reactivation of AKT or ERK, which was caused
by a relief of a feedback inhibition of the RTKs and/or
their downstream signaling pathways, occurred after
the inhibitors treatments. An RTKi combination, based
on the RTK phosphorylation profile in the cancer cells,
synergized with AKTi, but not MEKi, to inhibit the
reactivation of AKT and the growth of the CRC cells.
Our findings underscored the key role of the RTK-PI3KAKT pathway in the KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells, and
provided a novel strategy for CRC treatment.

suggested that the reactivation of AKT and ERK might be
the reason for the resistance of the KRAS or BRAF mutant
CRC cells to the AKTi and MEKi treatments.

The increased activation of RTKs were
responsible for the reactivation of AKT, but not
ERK
We next analyzed the phosphorylation of upstream
RTKs in order to understand the mechanisms of the
reactivation of AKT and ERK after the AKTi and/or
MEKi treatments by using the phospho-RTK arrays
[4, 5, 29]. More than one RTK was activated in eight of the
nine cell lines (Figure 3A). The frequently activated RTKs
were EGFR family members (EGFR, HER2 and HER3),
insulin receptor family members (InsR and IGF1R), and
HGFR (hepatocyte growth factor receptor, also known as
MET). However, the RTK phosphorylation patterns were
heterogeneous among the KRAS or BRAF mutant cells
(Figure 3A).
We then analyzed the RTK phosphorylation changes
after the AKTi and MEKi treatments. The phosphorylation
of the activated RTKs was increased in all tested cell lines
after 24 hours AKTi treatment (Figure 3B). In contrast,
the phosphorylation of RTKs was only induced in two
cell lines (LOVO and LS174T) after 24 hours MEKi
treatment and was not correlated with the reactivation of
ERK (Figure 3C).
To understand the function of the activated
RTKs, we treated the cells with a combination of the
corresponding RTK inhibitors (RTKis) (Supplementary
Figure S1) or together with the AKTi or MEKi (Figure
3B–3E). Lapatinib (LAP) was used for inhibiting EGFR
family [30], OSI-906 (OSI) for Insulin Receptor family
[31], and jnj38877605 (JNJ) for HGFR family [32].
The combination of RTKis and AKTi abolished the
reactivation of AKT, but the combination of RTKis and
MEKi did not abolish the reactivation of ERK (Figure
3B–3E). Meanwhile, the combination of MEKi and RTKis
could not abolish the up-regulation of p-CRAF, which
was reported to reactivate the ERK after MEKi treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2) [17, 18, 33]. These data
suggested that the increased phosphorylation of the RTKs
by the AKTi treatment was responsible for the reactivation
of AKT.

RESULTS
AKTi and MEKi were insufficient to inhibit
growth of most of the KRAS or BRAF mutant
CRC cells
We collected nine KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC
cell lines and inhibited the MEK/ERK pathway and/or
the PI3K/AKT pathway downstream of RAS-RAF with
a MEK inhibitor (MEKi) U0126 and/or an AKT inhibitor
(AKTi) MK2206 [27, 28]. The concentrations of the two
inhibitors we used were sufficient to completely inhibit
the phosphorylation of MEK and AKT in vitro. The foci
formation experiments demonstrated that for most cells,
inhibition of both MEK and AKT led to less than 70%
cell growth inhibition (13% for SW480, 36% for SW1116,
61% for HCT-15, 51% for LS174T, 27% for HCT-116,
31% for HT-29, 63% for WIDR and 56% for COLO205)
(Figure 1A and 1B). LOVO cell line was the only cell line
that was dramatically inhibited by the AKTi (93% growth
inhibition) and by the combination of the AKTi and the
MEKi (97% growth inhibition). These data indicated that
the AKTi and MEKi were insufficient to inhibit the growth
of most of the KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells.

AKT and ERK were reactivated after the AKTi
and/or MEKi treatments
To understand the mechanisms underlying the
resistance of the KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells to
the AKTi and/or the MEKi treatments, we investigated
whether AKT and ERK signaling were inhibited
effectively. The AKT phosphorylation was inhibited after
1 hour AKTi treatment, but was restored within 24 hours
in the five AKTi-resistant cell lines (Figure 2A). The
AKT phosphorylation was restored to a less extend in
the AKTi-sensitive cell line LOVO. Similarly, the ERK
phosphorylation was also inhibited after 1 hour MEKi
treatment, but was reactivated within 24 hours in all the
six MEKi-resistant cell lines (Figure 2B). Furthermore,
the combination of AKTi and MEKi could not prevent the
reactivations of AKT and ERK (Figure 2C). These results

treatments inhibited the growth of CRC cells by

To understand the functions of the activated RTKs
for the growth of the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cells,
the cells were treated with LAP, OSI, or JNJ individually
or in combination based on the phospho-RTK patterns
(Figure 4A and 4B). The concentrations we used were
sufficient to completely inhibit the phosphorylation

of targeted RTKs. The RTKi combinations potently
inhibited the growth of the three BRAF mutant cell lines
(COLO205, HT-29, and WIDR), and two of the KRAS
mutant cell lines (LOVO and LS174T, more than 70%
inhibition). However, four other KRAS mutant cell
lines (SW480, SW1116, HCT-116, and HCT-15) were
resistant to the RTKi combination treatments (less than
60% inhibition). The RTKi combinations synergistically
inhibited the growth of the sensitive cells, because the
IC50s in the combinations decreased more than 10-fold
than that in the single drug treatments (Figure 4C).
We then selected three cell lines with different
growth inhibition rates (HT-29, LS174T, and HCT116), and measured the phosphorylation of RTKs and
downstream effectors after drug treatments. Inhibition
of a single RTK increased the phosphorylation of the
remaining non-targeted RTKs. However, the RTKi
combinations inhibited the phosphorylation of all
targeted RTKs as well as the phosphorylation of AKT in
all three cell lines (Figure 4D). We also observed strong
inhibitions of AKT phosphorylation, but not that of ERK,

by the RTKis treatments in six of the seven KRAS or
BRAF mutant CRC cells (Figure 4E and Supplementary
Figure S3). These data demonstrated that the activated
RTKs supported the growth of the KRAS or BRAF mutant
CRC cells through the PI3K-AKT pathway. Phospho-RTK
profile-based RTKi combination treatments inhibited the
AKT signaling and the growth of BRAF or KRAS mutant
CRC cells.

RTKi combinations synergized with AKTi but
not MEKi to inhibit the growth of CRC cells
Because the AKTi treatment increased the
phosphorylation of RTKs in the KRAS or BRAF mutant
CRC cells, we hypothesized that the combination of RTKis
and AKTi might inhibit the cell growth more efficiently.
Indeed, the growth inhibition with the combination
treatments were above 70% in all cell lines except SW480
(Figure 5A and 5B). The combination of AKTi and RTKis
exhibited synergistic effects in six of the nine cell lines,
as indicated by the coefficient of drug interaction (CDI)

(Figure 5C). Moreover, the combination of RTKis plus
AKTi inhibited cell growth more potently than the single
RTKi plus AKTi (Figure 5D). The combination of RTKis
plus MEKi also inhibited cell growth more efficiently
than the individual RTKis or MEKi (Figure 5A and 5E).
However, the CDIs of the MEKi combinations were all
around 1, indicating additive effects rather than synergistic
effects (Figure 5C). These data demonstrated that the
RTKi combinations synergized with AKTi but not MEKi
to inhibit the growth of the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC
cells.

for 2 hours. Additional AKTi did not inhibit the AKT
reactivation but addition of low doses RTKis inhibited the
reactivation of AKT (Figure 6A). Similarly, in SW1116
cells, AKT was reactivated even at the AKTi concentration
of 2.5 µM, which was 10-fold of the concentration we
used for a complete AKT inhibition at 1 hour (Figure 6B).
Moreover, the IC50 of AKTi in the combination of AKTi
and RTKis was nearly 100-fold lower than that of the
single AKTi treatment in LS174T cells (Supplementary
Table S1). The combination of AKTi and RTKis was
also more cell-selective than the single AKTi treatment
(Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, the combination of
RTKis and AKTi was more efficient than high doses of
AKTi to completely inhibit the AKT phosphorylation and
the growth of the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cells.
In contrast, the combination of RTKis with the MEKi
did not inhibit the reactivation of ERK (Figure 3C and 3E).
The phosphorylation of CRAF was increased by the MEKi
treatment but could not be reduced by RTKis treatment
(Supplementary Figure S2). There were also no new RTKs
activated concomitantly with the increased phosphorylation
of CRAF after the MEKi treatment (Figure 6C), suggesting

The RTK/IRS1-mediated reactivation of AKT
was responsible for the insufficient inhibition of
cell growth by AKTi
The above data indicated a good correlation between
the efficient inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and the
inhibition of cancer cell growth. We then asked whether
increasing the dose of AKTi could inhibit the AKT
reactivation. The HCT-116 cells were pretreated with
AKTi for 46 hours, and then treated with AKTi or RTKis

that the reactivation mechanism of ERK was different from
that of AKT and the RTKs were not involved.
Because RTKs activate AKT through the PI3K-3phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1)
pathway, we asked whether the AKT reactivation

depended on PI3K and PDK1. The reactivation of AKT
by AKTi treatment was inhibited by the PI3K inhibitor,
the PDK1 inhibitor, or the PIP3-AKT binding inhibitor in
Figure 6D, confirming that AKT was reactivated through
the RTK-PI3K-AKT pathway [34–36].

Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) was reported
to mediate the feedback inhibition of the RTK-PI3KAKT pathway [37–39]. We therefore analyzed the
phosphorylation of IRS1 after AKTi treatment. The
Y895-phosphorylated IRS1 was increased in all of the
four cell lines analyzed (Figure 6E). Further analysis
demonstrated that AKTi also increased the expression
of IRS1 (Figure 6B). The combinations of RTKis and
AKTi blocked the induction of IRS1 phosphorylation
in all the four cell lines analyzed (Figure 6E). These
results suggested that a relief of a feedback inhibition of
the RTK-IRS1-PI3K-AKT pathway was responsible for
the reactivation of AKT after AKTi or AKTi plus MEKi
treatment in the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cells, and
the combination of RTKis and AKTi efficiently inhibited
the reactivation of AKT and the cancer cell growth.

The AKT kinase is an attractive drug target due to
its pro-survival and pro-growth role in cancer cells [42].
However, the AKTi anti-cancer drug MK2206, when
used at the dose to effectively inhibit cancer cell growth,
causes several adverse effects such as rash, gastrointestinal
symptoms, fatigue, and hyperglycemia, which hinder its
clinical applications [43]. The combination of AKTi and
RTKis may reduce the AKTi-caused toxicity by using
the AKTi at a lower dose (Supplementary Table S1).
Moreover, the combination of AKTi and RTKis was more
selective than the single AKTi treatment among different
cells.
Based on these results, we propose a model to
explain the functions and regulations of AKT and ERK
in the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cells (Figure 7). In
the KRAS mutant cells, AKT is activated by both the
mutant RAS and normal RTKs, but inhibited by a negative
feedback mechanism through the RTK-IRS1-PI3K
pathway. ATKi inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT, but
also relieves the feedback inhibition of RTK and/or IRS1,
leading to reactivation of AKT. ERK on the other hand
is activated mainly by the mutant RAS, while inhibited
by another feedback mechanism through CRAF. MEKi
inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK, but relieves the
feedback inhibition of CRAF, leading to the reactivation
of ERK. In the BRAF mutant cells, AKT and ERK are
regulated by similar positive and negative pathways as that
in the KRAS mutant cells, except that ERK is activated
by the mutant BRAF instead of KRAS. The combination
of RTKis synergized with AKTi, but not with MEKi, to
completely inhibit the activation of AKT, but not that of
ERK, to block the cancer cell growth.
Taken together, our data suggest a complete
inhibition of AKT by a combination of RTKis, based on
the RTK activation profile, and AKTi as an effective way
to inhibit the growth of the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC
cells.

DISCUSSION
Receptor tyrosine kinases and their downstream
signaling molecules are major anti-cancer drug targets
and the drugs targeting these molecules have been
successful in treating certain cancers whose growth rely
on the targeted molecules [10]. However, many cancers,
such as colorectal cancers, contain KRAS/BRAF mutant
genes and are resistant to MEKi, BRAFi, or RTKis
treatments [24, 40, 41]. Therefore, we explored strategies
to treat the KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells with various
inhibitors against the key signaling molecules along the
RTK signaling pathway individually or in combination.
We found a reactivation of AKT and ERK after the AKTi
and/or MEKi treatments as the mechanism for the cancer
cell resistance to AKTi and MEKi. A relief of a feedback
inhibition of the RTK-IRS1-PDK1-AKT signaling
was responsible for the reactivation of AKT. The RTKi
combinations synergized with AKTi to inhibit the growth
of KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells, along with a complete
inhibition of AKT phosphorylation. These data suggest a
major role of the PI3K-AKT pathway in supporting the
growth of the KRAS or BRAF mutant CRC cells and an
effective way to inhibit the pathway.
On the contrary, the RTKs did not seem to be
responsible for the reactivation of ERK after the MEKi
treatment, because we did not observe increased activation
of the RTKs after the treatment in most of the cell lines
analyzed and the combinations of RTKis and MEKi did not
block the ERK reactivation. It has been reported that CRAF
was involved in the MEKi resistance in KRAS mutant
cancer cells [18]. We also observed an activation of CRAF
after the MEKi treatment in the CRC cells, suggesting
that CRAF may be the key molecule that mediates the
feedback inhibition of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK signaling
pathway. Thus, the reactivations of AKT and ERK after
the AKTi and/or MEKi treatment are mediated by distinct
mechanisms, and different strategies are needed to block
the reactivations and to inhibit the cancer cell growth.

Figure 7: Schematic diagram of the RTK signaling pathways in the KRAS/BRAF mutant CRC cells. (A) Regulation of

AKT and ERK in KRAS mutant cancer cells. Left: Untreated cells. Middle: AKTi-treated cells. Right: MEKi-treated cells. (B). Regulation
of AKT and ERK in BRAF mutant cancer cells. Left: Untreated cells. Middle: AKTi-treated cells. Right: MEKi-treated cells. In the KRAS
mutant cells, AKT is activated by both the mutant RAS and normal RTKs, but inhibited by a negative feedback mechanism through the
RTK-IRS1-PI3K pathway. ATKi inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT, but also relieves the feedback inhibition of RTK and/or IRS1, leading
to reactivation of AKT. ERK on the other hand is activated mainly by the mutant RAS, while inhibited by another feedback mechanism
through CRAF. MEKi inhibits the phosphorylation of ERK, but relieves the feedback inhibition of CRAF, leading to the reactivation of
ERK. In the BRAF mutant cells, AKT and ERK are regulated by similar positive and negative pathways as that in the KRAS mutant cells,
except that ERK is activated by the mutant BRAF instead of KRAS.

5 mg protein lysates of the cultured cells were
analyzed using phospho-RTK arrays (R&D Systems).
The arrays were photographed and the phospho-RTK
index was calculated according to the following formula:
phospho-RTKx index = (INTx-INTnc)/ (INTref-INTnc). INTx
is the pixel density of RTKx, INTnc is the pixel density of
background, and INTref is the density of reference spots.
Receptors were considered to be phosphorylated/activated
when index values were greater than 0.1.

Western blotting
Cells were harvested in RIPA buffer. Protein lysates
were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (GE Healthcare), probed with first antibodies,
and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
secondary antibodies. Immune complexes were detected by
ImmobilonTM western chemiluminescence HRP substrate
(Millipore) and photographed using Image Station
4000 MM PRO system (Carestream).
