Abstract
The geldanamycin derivatives 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and 17-dimethylaminoethylamino17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) are promising
chemotherapeutic drugs that inhibit heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) function. Previous studies have shown that 17-AAG/
DMAG treatment induces the degradation of mutant BRAF
(V600E) and inhibits the activation of mitogen-activated
protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2).
We have found, however, that HSP90 inhibition alone is not
sufficient for efficient BRAF(V600E) degradation in some cells.
HSP90 inhibitors structurally unrelated to geldanamycin,
radicicol and novobiocin, while inducing the degradation of
the HSP90 client protein RAF-1 fail to induce BRAF(V600E)
degradation or inhibit MEK1/2 activation in HT29 human
colon cancer cells. Moreover, after treatment with 17-DMAG,
the kinase activity of residual, undegraded BRAF(V600E) was
also lost. Incubation of cells with a reactive oxygen species
(ROS) scavenger, N-acetyl cysteine, partially restored kinase
activity and also partially prevented BRAF(V600E) degradation due to 17-DMAG treatment. Conversely, treatment with
the ROS producing drug menadione clearly inhibited MEK1/2
and reduced BRAF(V600E). These results suggest that in
addition to direct inhibition of HSP90, the antitumor effect of
geldanamycin and its derivatives is also mediated though the
production of ROS, which may directly inactivate tumorigenic
mutant BRAF(V600E). [Cancer Res 2008;68(15):6324–30]

Introduction
BRAF, the major extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2
(ERK1/2) activator in vertebrates, is required for the maintenance
of basal ERK1/2 activity and displays potent transforming activity
(1–3). Mutations in BRAF have been identified in 70% of malignant
melanomas, 30% of papillary thyroid and serous ovarian carcinomas, 15% of colorectal cancers, and at lower frequencies in a wide
range of additional human cancers (4, 5). Examination of 126
patients with papillary thyroid cancer indicated that the BRAF
mutation correlated significantly with distant metastasis and
clinical stage (6). In a systematic evaluation of BRAF and KRAS

mutations in 330 colorectal tumors, Rajagopalan and colleagues (7)
identified 32 mutations (10%) in BRAF, 28 with a V600E mutation,
and 1 each with the R461I, I462S, G463E, or K601E mutations. All
but 2 mutations seemed to be heterozygous and, in all 20 cases for
which normal tissue was available, the mutations were shown to be
somatic. In the same set of tumors, there were 169 mutations (51%)
in KRAS. Because no tumor was detected with mutations in both
BRAF and KRAS, this suggests that BRAF and KRAS mutations are
nearly equivalent in their tumorigenic effects and possibly arise at
similar phases of tumorigenesis.
The majority of identified BRAF mutations (f90%) lead to
substitution of valine 600 by glutamic acid [BRAF(V600E)], which
mimics the conformational change induced in the activation
segment by T599 and S602 phosphorylation (5, 8). Mutations in
KRAS or BRAF can cause constitutive activation of mitogenactivated protein (MAP)/ERK1/2 kinase (MEK1/2) and ERK1/2
in cancer cells that account for their malignancy. In vitro
expression of BRAF(V600E) has been shown to transform
fibroblasts and melanocytes as well as to induce hematopoietic
dysplasia in transgenic mice and invasive melanomas in p53 /
zebrafish (4, 9–12). Likewise, the growth of BRAF(V600E)transformed fibroblasts in xenografts is highly dependent on
BRAF(V600E) expression (13), and the suppression of BRAF(V600E)
expression in melanoma lines abrogates their transformed
phenotype (14, 15). High basal level ERK1/2 activity is observed
in >60% (combined KRAS and BRAF gene mutation frequency) of
colon cancers, thus targeting the BRAF signaling pathway may be
an effective approach to control these highly malignant cancers.
Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is a key molecular chaperone that
mediates the cellular stress response by regulating the conformation, stability, and function of critical client proteins functioning in
the signal transduction, cell cycle, growth control, and apoptosis
pathways (16–20). Among such HSP90 client proteins are key
oncogenic/growth-stimulating client proteins such as RAF-1, AKT
(protein kinase Ba), ERBB2 (Her2), PLK1 (Polo-like kinase 1), MET
(hepatocyte growth factor receptor), Aurora B (AIM1), PIM-1,
survivin (API4), hTERT, CDK4, and cyclin D1. The benzoquinone
ansamycin antibiotic geldanamycin, along with its clinically used
analogue 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) and
the water-soluble analogue 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), binds to HSP90 and inhibits
its function by masking the ATP binding site (21, 22). Drug binding
to HSP90 by geldanamycin or 17-AAG/DMAG inhibits maturation
and increases degradation of several cellular survival factors, which
contributes to these drugs’ significant anticancer properties (22).
Treatment with 17-AAG also sensitizes tumor cells to IR exposure
(23–27). In phase I clinical trials, 17-AAG was well-tolerated in

patients, with only minor cardiac and lung toxicity, although the
drug is also taken up by normal cells. One advantage of using
17-AAG/DMAG as a radiosensitizing agent is the differential effect
in normal and tumor cells. In tumor cells, as opposed to normal
cells, HSP90 is mainly present in an activated state as part of a
multichaperone complex that has a 100-fold higher affinity for
17-AAG (28). Additionally, Eustace and colleagues (28) found that
HSP90a can be secreted extracellularly where it binds to and
activates matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), thereby facilitating
the tumor cell invasiveness. Inhibition of extracellular HSP90a by
17-AAG/DMAG would decrease both MMP2 activity and tumor
invasiveness in addition to radiosensitizing tumor cells, further
increasing the potential value of this drug class as chemotherapeutic agents.
Previously, we found that indomethacin inhibits ERK1/2 activity
in HT29 human colon carcinoma cells, which have high
constitutive ERK1/2 activity due to the BRAF(V600E) mutation,
and that indomethacin also sensitized cells to radiation (26).
Because treatment with 17-AAG further radiosensitized indomethacin-treated HT29 cells (26), we asked whether 17-AAG/DMAG
might affect MAP kinase activity. Although 17-AAG/DMAG
strongly inhibited cellular ERK1/2 activity by destabilizing
BRAF(V600E) as reported previously (29, 30), we also found that
inhibition of HSP90 alone is not sufficient to induce these two
events. This report describes a novel mechanism of BRAF(V600E)
kinase inhibition by 17-AAG/DMAG involving reactive oxygen
species (ROS) production and proposes that in addition to HSP90
inhibition, the direct inactivation of tumorigenic mutant
BRAF(V600E) by drug-induced ROS may contribute to the
antitumor activity of geldanamycin-related drugs as well.

Results

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, chemicals, antibodies. HT29, MCF7, SK-MEL-2, SK-MEL28, and A2058 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection
and maintained in McCoy’s 5A and DMEM (Life Technologies), respectively,
supplemented with 10% FCS in a humidified incubator atmosphere of
5% CO2-95% air. Cyclohexamide was obtained from Sigma Co. Radicicol,
and novobiocin were obtained from Calbiochem. The drugs 17-AAG and
17-DMAG were a gift from the Developmental Therapeutics Program,
National Cancer Institute, NIH. Primary antibodies against phosphorylated
ERK1/2, phosphorylated MEK (p-MEK), and total MEK1/2 (pan-MEK) were
from Cell Signaling Technology; BRAF, RAF-1, h-actin, and CDC37 were
from Santa Cruz; HSP90 was from Assay Design; and p53 was from EMD
Chemicals.
Western blotting. Cells were directly lysed in tissue culture wells with
NP40 lysis buffer [20 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mmol/L NaCl, 1 mmol/L
EDTA, and 1% NP40] supplemented with proteinase inhibitors (0.5 Ag/mL
aprotinin, 0.5 Ag/mL leupeptin, and 0.7 Ag/mL pepstatin A) and with
phosphatase inhibitors (2 mmol/L sodium PPi, 50 mmol/L NaF, 5 mmol/L
h-glycerophosphate, and 1 mmol/L sodium orthovanadate). Lysates were
subjected to a brief sonication then clarified by centrifugation (14,000  g )
for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected. Protein concentrations
were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Total cell lysates were
separated by SDS-PAGE, and the proteins were transferred onto ImmobilonP membranes (Millipore). Membranes were incubated with primary
antibodies followed by secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase. Signals were detected using SuperSignal West Femto system
(Pierce).
Coimmunoprecipitation. MCF7 cells were transfected with BRAF(V600E)expressing plasmid by electroporation and 48 h later treated with 17-DMAG
(1 Amol/L) or radicicol (3 Amol/L) for 4 h then lysed in NP40 lysis buffer
supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as
described. BRAF(V600E) was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates with

www.aacrjournals.org

anti-BRAF antibody or normal IgG as a control. Coprecipitated HSP90 and
CDC37 were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HSP90 antibody and antiCDC37 antibody, respectively.
Intracellular pro-oxidant production. Cellular pro-oxidant production
was determined using the oxidation-sensitive 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2’, 7¶dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (C-400, 10 Ag/mL) fluorescent probes
as described previously (31). Oxidation-insensitive 5-(and-6)-carboxy-2¶,
7¶-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (C-368, 10 Ag/mL) fluorescent dyes were
used as controls for changes in uptake, ester cleavage, and efflux, so that
any changes in fluorescence seen between groups with the oxidationsensitive dye could be directly attributed to changes in dye oxidation. Both
probes were obtained from Invitrogen and dissolved in DMSO. After drug
treatment, cells were harvested at 37jC using trypsin/EDTA, resuspended in
37jC medium with or without drugs, labeled with the fluorescent dyes for
15 min at 37jC, placed on ice, and analyzed using a FACS440 flow
cytometer (BD Biosciences; excitation, 488 nm; emission, 535 nm). The
mean fluorescence intensity of 20,000 cells was analyzed in each sample and
corrected for autofluorescence from unlabeled cells.
Immunoprecipitation-kinase assay. Human HT29 cells were treated
with 17-DMAG (1 Amol/L) for 16 h then lysed in NP40 lysis buffer
supplemented with proteinase inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors as
described. BRAF(V600E) was immunoprecipitated from cleared lysates with
anti-BRAF antibody and used for the in vitro kinase assay. Precipitated
beads were resuspended in kinase buffer [20 mmol/L MOPS (pH 7.2),
25 mmol/L h-glycerophosphate, 5 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L sodium
orthovanadate, 15 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L DTT, 10 ACi of g-32P ATP, and
50 Amol/L ATP] along with bacterially produced recombinant human
MEK1 as a substrate and incubated at 30jC for 30 min. The reactions were
terminated by addition of 10 AL of 4  SDS sample buffer, heated at 95jC
for 3 min, then analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The p-MEK levels were measured by
PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) after resolution by SDS-PAGE. The
immunoprecipitated BRAF(V600E) was visualized by Western blotting.

Geldanamycin and its derivatives, 17-AAG and 17-DMAG, are
HSP90-specific inhibitors under clinical evaluation currently as
chemotherapy drugs. Recently, we found that 17-AAG enhances
indomethacin-induced radiosensitization of HT29 cells (26). In
HT29 cells, an oncogenic mutation in the BRAF gene (V600E; ref. 4)
leads to constitutive activation of ERK1/2. Preliminary studies
from our laboratory (Supplementary Fig. S1), as well as published
results (29, 30), indicate that 17-AAG/DMAG treatment decreases
cellular BRAF(V600E) levels, without altering BRAF mRNA levels
(Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting loss of HSP90 function
increased BRAF degradation. Loss of BRAF(V600E) in 17-AAG/
DMAG–treated cells also corresponded with decreased MAP
activation as determined by measurements of cellular p-MEK
and p-ERK levels (Supplementary Fig. S1).
The depletion of cellular BRAF(V600E) and inhibition of
MEK1/2 activity by geldanamycin-related drugs are not
characteristic of all HSP90 inhibitors. The HSP90 chaperone
plays a key role in regulating the cellular stability and activity of its
client proteins; therefore, we tested whether inhibition of HSP90
function was the sole mechanism responsible for BRAF(V600E)
degradation. Radicicol is a potent inhibitor that, such as
geldanamycin-related drugs, interacts with the HSP90 NH2terminal ATPase domain but which has a different chemical
structure. HT29 cells were treated with 17-AAG, 17-DMAG, or
radicicol for 16 h, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot
analysis of cellular BRAF(V600E), p-MEK, pan-MEK, HSP70,
and mutant p53 (R273H) levels (Fig. 1A). Treatment with 17-AAG
or 17-DMAG reduced the amount of BRAF(V600E) (lanes 2 and 3,
respectively) as previously described (Supplementary Fig. S1). The

Figure 1. Inhibition of HSP90 alone is not sufficient for MEK1/2 inhibition and reduced BRAF(V600E) levels. A, treatment of HT29 cells with the HSP90 inhibitor
radicicol does not reduce cellular BRAF(V600E) levels nor inhibit MEK1/2. HT29 cells were treated with 17-DMAG (1 Amol/L) or radicicol (1 or 3 Amol/L) for 16 h.
Lane 4, HT29 cells were treated with 17-DMAG (1 Amol/L) together with proteasome inhibitors (PrI ; MG132, PSI, ALLN, lactacystin, 10 Amol/L each) for 16 h.
Cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of BRAF, p-MEK, pan-MEK, HSP70, and p53. Note that radicicol effectively inhibited
HSP90 function, as indicated by HSP70 induction, but failed to reduce BRAF(V600E) levels or inhibit MEK1/2 activation. B, the effect of HSP90 inhibitors on
HSP90 client protein levels. HT29 cells were treated with 17-DMAG (1 Amol/L), radicicol (3 Amol/L), or novobiocin (0.8 mmol/L) for 16 h (44, 45). Cell lysates were
analyzed by Western blotting for the expression of BRAF(V600E), RAF-1, and h-actin. C, both 17-DMAG and radicicol dissociate BRAF(V600E)-containing complexes.
MCF7 cells were transfected with BRAF(V600E) expression plasmid, and 48 h later, transfected cells were treated with 17-DMAG (1 Amol/L) or radicicol (3 Amol/L)
for 4 h. Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP ) with anti-BRAF antibody or normal IgG. Precipitated proteins were separated by
SDS-PAGE and HSP90, and CDC37 in the complexes were determined by Western blotting. D, expression of BRAF(V600E), HSP90, and CDC37 in transfected
MCF7 cells. The cellular expression levels of BRAF(V600E), HSP90, and CDC37 in transfected MCF7 cells used in C were analyzed by Western blotting.

reduction in p-MEK was due to the inhibition of MEK1/2 activation
because the total amount of MEK1/2 protein was not changed.
Radicicol treatment, in contrast, did not cause any reduction in
BRAF(V600E) levels or inhibition of MEK1/2 activation (lanes 5
and 6). Accumulation of HSP70 was evident in cells treated with
17-AAG, 17-DMAG, or radicicol (lanes 2, 3, 5, and 6), suggesting
that all these compounds inhibited HSP90, resulting in activated
heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) and HSP70 expression. Addition of
proteasome inhibitors (MG132, ALLN, PSI, and lactacystin) to
17-DMAG–treated cells partially inhibited the BRAF(V600E)
reduction (lane 4), suggesting that loss of cellular BRAF(V600E)
was due, at least in part, to proteosome-mediated degradation.
There was no degradation of mutant p53 (R273H), in cells treated
with either 17-AAG/DMAG or radicicol.
The RAF-1 protein is another established HSP90 client protein
and, when HT29 cells were treated with HSP90 inhibitors (17-DMAG,
radicicol, and novobiocin), the cellular levels of RAF-1 were depleted
(Fig. 1B); however, only 17-DMAG treatment caused BRAF(V600E)
loss. Thus, both radicicol and novobiocin can inhibit HSP90 function
in HT29 cells. Heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF-1) is a client
protein activated by inhibition of HSP90 function, and 17-DMAG–
treated cells, as well as novobiocin-treated cells, contained activated
HSF-1 as determined by acquisition of promoter DNA–binding
capability in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Only weak activation of HSF-1 by radicicol was observed,
and this is consistent with weak HSP70 induction (Fig. 1A).
Radicicol seemed to only partially inhibit HSP90 function with
respect to HSF1 activation, we therefore directly tested whether the

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (15). August 1, 2008

BRAF(V600E)-HSP90 complex was dissociated by radicicol or
17-DMAG because inhibition of HSP90 function is associated with
rapid dissociation of bound client proteins (32). Thus, HT29 cells
were cultured for 4 h with or without the HSP90 inhibitors then
harvested and the cell lysates subjected to immunoprecipitation
with BRAF-specific antibody. After only 4 h of drug treatment, with

Western blotting for the expression of BRAF [BRAF(V600E) for SK-MEL-28
and A2058, wild-type (wt) for SK-MEL-2, active MEK1/2 (p-MEK), pan-MEK],

ROS Inactivate Tumorigenic BRAF Mutant Kinase

Figure 3. The 17-DMAG–induced reduction in BRAF(V600E) levels and
inhibition of MEK1/2 activation are ROS dependent but not caspase dependent.
HT29 cells were incubated with the indicated drugs for 16 h, and cell lysates
were prepared. The expression of BRAF(V600E), p-MEK, and pan-MEK were
determined by Western blotting. Note that zVAD-fmk treatment did not preserve
BRAF(V600E) expression levels or MEK1/2 activation (lane 4), whereas
NAC treatment provided significant protection (lane 7).

either 17-DMAG or radicicol, there was no change in total
BRAF(V600E) levels (Fig. 1C). The immunoprecipitated BRAF(V600E)
was analyzed for the presence of HSP90 and CDC37, a cochaperone
of HSP90, by Western blotting. In control cells, BRAF(V600E) was
recovered complexed with HSP90 and CDC37. Treatment of cells
with either 17-DMAG or radicicol significantly decreased the amount
of HSP90/CDC37 complex recovered with immunoprecipitated
BRAF, indicating that the complexes were equally dissociated by
17-DMAG and radicicol (Fig. 1C), although the latter drug was
apparently less effective in disrupting HSP90-HSF1 complexes.
More importantly, these results indicate that although each HSP90
inhibitor dissociated BRAF(V600E)-HSP90 complexes, only 17-DMAG
also induced degradation.
To determine whether the observed effects of HSP90 inhibitors (17DMAG, radicicol, and novobiocin) on BRAF(V600E) and MEK1/2
activation were specific to HT29 cells, melanoma cell lines
expressing either mutant BRAF(V600E; SK-MEL-28 and A2058) or
wild-type BRAF (SK-MEL-2; ref. 4) were also examined (Fig. 2).
Although less effective than in HT29 cells, 17-DMAG treatment
reduced BRAF(V600E) levels in both SK-MEL-28 and A2058 but
only slightly reduced wild-type BRAF levels in SK-MEL-2 cells, as
reported previously (29, 30). Interestingly, radicicol was as effective
as 17-DMAG in reducing melanoma BRAF(V600E) or wild-type

BRAF levels and inhibiting MEK1/2 activation. The response to
novobiocin treatment, however, was highly variable in melanoma
cells. In SK-MEL-28 cells, novobiocin inhibited MEK1/2 effectively
while only partially reducing BRAF(V600E). In A2058 and SK-MEL-2
cell lines, novobiocin partially reduced BRAF(V600E) or wild-type
BRAF levels, as did 17-DMAG treatment, but without inhibiting
MEK1/2 activities. Inhibition of MEK1/2 activity in melanoma cells
by novobiocin, therefore, is not the direct result of reduced
BRAF(V600E) or wild-type BRAF levels but seems to be dependent
on an unknown, variable cellular factor(s).
The antioxidant drug N-acetyl-L-cysteine partially protects
cellular BRAF(V600E) levels and MEK1/2 activation. We next
investigated whether caspase activation, due to 17-AAG/DMAG–
induced cell death, could inhibit MEK phosphorylation by degrading
BRAF(V600E). Cells (HT29) were incubated with a broad-spectrum
caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk together with 17-DMAG for 16 h and
cell lysates prepared for Western blot analysis (Fig. 3). As before
(Fig. 1A), 17-DMAG treatment strongly inhibited MEK1/2 activation
and reduced the amount of BRAF(V600E; lane 2). Inclusion of
zVAD-fmk failed to rescue MEK1/2 activation nor protect
BRAF(V600E) levels (lane 4). These results clearly show that both
MEK1/2 inhibition and BRAF(V600E) degradation by 17-DMAG
treatment are not caspase dependent.
Geldanamycin and its derivatives, 17-AAG and 17-DMAG, are
capable of inducing oxidative stress in cells due to the common
benzoquinone structural element (see next section; Fig. 4). However, the HSP90 inhibitors radicicol and novobiocin used in the
previous experiments, and which lack the benzoquinone moiety,
do not induce oxidative stress in cells and fail to inhibit MEK1/2
and to reduce BRAF(V600E) in HT29 cells. Therefore, we also
determined the potential role of 17-DMAG–induced oxidative stress
in MEK1/2 inhibition and BRAF(V600E) reduction. HT29 cells were
treated with 17-DMAG with or without added N-acetyl-L-cysteine
(NAC), a potent oxidative radical scavenger. In contrast to the
lack of any effect observed with caspase inhibition, NAC partially
protected MEK1/2 activity and fully protected BRAF(V600E)
levels (Fig. 3, lane 7). Neither NAC treatment alone nor NaClinduced osmotic stress had any effect on BRAF(V600E) levels or
MEK1/2 activity or cellular MEK levels (lanes 5 and 6). We next
determined the relative degree of cellular ROS produced by 17DMAG treatment.
To measure the relative level of ROS in cells, we used carboxyH2DCFDA (C400; Invitrogen) as a cell-permeant fluorescent
indicator for ROS and the ROS-insensitive carboxy-H2DCF (C368;

Figure 4. Increased production of ROS in 17-DMAG–
treated cells. A, HT29 cells were treated with 17-DMAG
(1 Amol/L) and/or NAC (20 mmol/L) for 16 h. Cells were
trypsinized and labeled with C-400 or C-368 (10 Ag/mL)
for 15 min at 37jC. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting
analysis was performed to measure intracellular ROS
production as indicated by C-400 dye fluorescence
using the C-368 signal as a reference measurement for
drug uptake. Relative ROS production is normalized to
nontreated cells. B, HT29 cells were treated with 17-DMAG
(1 Amol/L), radicicol (3 Amol/L), and menadione (50 Amol/L)
for 16 h as indicated. Cell lysates were subjected to
Western blotting analysis for the expression of
BRAF(V600E), p-MEK, and pan-MEK.

Invitrogen) as a cellular dye-uptake reference. As shown in Fig. 4A,
17-DMAG treatment increased ROS levels f2.5-fold over levels in
nontreated cells. Treatment with NAC nearly completely eliminated basal level ROS as well as the 17-DMAG–induced increase in
production. Because the uptake of C368 dye did not change
significantly during treatment, these results indicated that
17-DMAG indeed increased cellular ROS production as predicted
from the molecular structure, and NAC was able to remove it. The
results from these experiments suggest that 17-AAG/DMAG
treatment induces a significant rise in intracellular ROS levels that
could partially account for both the decrease in BRAF(V600E) and
the inhibition of MEK1/2 activation. This hypothesis was further
tested by asking whether forced ROS production in cells also leads
to reduced BRAF(V600E) levels and MEK1/2 inhibition. In cells
treated with menadione, a drug widely used to induce intracellular
ROS production and which also contains a benzoquinone structure
(33), drug treatment alone partially reduced cellular BRAF(V600E)
levels and significantly inhibited MEK1/2 (Fig. 4B). These effects
were enhanced when combined with radicicol treatment, whereas
radicicol treatment alone failed to show a clear reduction of
BRAF(V600E) or inhibition of MEK1/2 in HT29 cells, strongly
supporting the notion that inhibition of HSP90 alone is not
sufficient to deplete BRAF(V600E) and inhibit MEK1/2 without
concurrent ROS production.
17-DMAG inactivates BRAF(V600E) kinase activity. The
previous experiments strongly suggest that ROS induced by
17-DMAG contributes to the degradation of BRAF(V600E). We
next asked whether 17-DMAG treatment inactivates BRAF(V600E)
kinase activity independently of BRAF(V600E) degradation. Cell
lysates were prepared from control and 17-DMAG–treated
(16 hours) HT29 cells, and the endogenous BRAF(V600E) protein
was recovered by immunoprecipitation with anti-BRAF antibody.
Equivalent amounts of BRAF(V600E) were then subjected to an
in vitro kinase assay with bacterially produced human MEK1 as
substrate. Immunoprecipitated BRAF(V600E) phosphorylated MEK
protein in vitro (Fig. 5A, lane 5), however, treatment with 17-DMAG
clearly inactivated the kinase activity of BRAF(V600E) (Fig. 5A,
lane 6), although equivalent levels of BRAF(V600E) protein were
used from treated and nontreated cell lysates (Fig. 5B, lanes 3
and 4). Therefore, we conclude that 17-DMAG treatment not only
induces BRAF(V600E) degradation but also directly inactivates
BRAF(V600E) kinase activity.

Discussion
Somatic missense mutations in BRAF, such as V600E, have been
identified in a wide range of human cancers including malignant
melanoma, thyroid cancer, and colon cancer (4). Mutations in
BRAF or KRAS cause constitutive activation of MAP kinase
pathways in cancer cells, which account for their high malignancy.
Indeed, elevated basal ERK1/2 activity is observed in >60% of colon
cancers (combined mutation frequency in KRAS and BRAF genes),
indicating inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway may be a
promising means of treating these highly malignant cancers.
We have found that, in addition to indomethacin, the
geldanamycin derivatives 17-AAG and 17-DMAG also inhibit the
MAP kinase pathway in HT29 human colon carcinoma cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Mutant BRAF(V600E), unlike the wild-type
protein, functions independent of its ability to bind Ras-GTP and is
therefore constitutively active (34), as is the MAP kinase pathway in
HT29 cells. Analysis of HT29 cells revealed that 17-AAG/DMAG

Figure 5. 17-DMAG inactivates BRAF(V600E) kinase activity. A, HT29 cells
were treated with 17-DMAG (1 Amol/L) for 16 h, and cell lysates were prepared.
Cell lysates (control, 250 Ag; drug treated, 500 Ag) were immunoprecipitated
with anti-BRAF antibody or normal IgG. After extensive washing, an in vitro
kinase assay was performed using bacterially produced human MEK1 protein
as a substrate, except for lanes 3 and 4 where substrate was omitted in the
kinase reaction. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS-sample buffer, and
the products were separated by SDS-PAGE. Incorporated 32P in MEK1 was
visualized by PhosphorImager. B, input immunoprecipitated BRAF(V600E)
used in the kinase assay in A was visualized by Western blotting. Note that
equivalent amounts of immunoprecipitated BRAF(V600E) from control and
17-DMAG–treated cells were used for the in vitro kinase assay.

treatment reduced cellular BRAF(V600E) levels and inhibited
MEK1/2, in good agreement with recent reports describing
BRAF(V600E) as a notable client protein of HSP90 (29, 30). Our
results, however, also clearly indicate that inhibition of HSP90
function alone is not sufficient to reduce cellular BRAF(V600E)
levels or inhibit MEK1/2, as HSP90 inhibitors structurally unrelated
to 17-AAG/DMAG, radicicol and novobiocin, fail to show similar
effects (Fig. 1).
Because HSP90 binding regulates client protein activity and/or
stability, we compared the effect of HSP90 inhibitors on two
additional client proteins: HSF1 and RAF-1. Both 17-DMAG and
novobiocin strongly activated HSF1 DNA binding capability, a
measure of HSP90-HSF1 complex dissociation, whereas radicicol
displayed minimal activation (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, we
also found that both 17-DMAG and radicicol equally dissociated
BRAF(V600E) complexes containing HSP90 and CDC37 (Fig. 1C).
All HSP90 inhibitors tested reduced cellular RAF-1 levels with
17-DMAG again the most effective. In fact, 17-DMAG was, in all
comparisons made, always the most effective drug and the least
dependent on cell line examined, whereas both radicicol and
novobiocin displayed a greater degree of substrate and cell line
variation. Because novobiocin binds to the COOH-terminal domain
of HSP90 (35), it will potentially interact with a different set of
substrates than 17-DMAG and radicicol, which bind to the NH2terminal ATPase domain. Novobiocin, for example, was recently
shown to block the HSP90 carboxy-terminal binding site for PI6K2,
leading to constitutive activation, whereas 17-AAG had no effect
(36). Despite the fact that 17-DMAG and radicicol share a common
binding domain in HSP90 and the structural and biochemical
alterations of HSP90 by these inhibitors are similar (35, 37), they
show different biological properties. Both dissociate BRAF-HSP90/
CDC37 complexes in HT29 cells, but radicicol is less effective in
disrupting HSP90-HSF complexes as well as inhibiting BRAF
activity. At least part of this difference in biological effect seems

to be due to intracellular ROS species generated by the geldanamycin-related drugs.
The effect of HSP90 inhibitors on reducing BRAF(V600E) levels
and inhibiting MEK1/2 activities was also determined in human
melanoma cell lines. As shown in Fig. 2, wild-type BRAF expressed
in SK-MEL-2 cells was relatively less sensitive to HSP90 inhibitors,
which is a good agreement with the previous reports (29, 30).
Novobiocin failed to inhibit MEK in this cell line or in A2058 cells,
which contain the mutant BRAF(V600E), indicating that BRAF
status does not affect novobiocin-dependent MEK inhibition. These
results also suggest that, although mutant N-Ras can generate
ROS (38) in SK-MEL-2 cells, wild-type BRAF is less sensitive to the
17-DMAG–mediated BRAF reduction.
Both 17-AAG and 17-DMAG contain a benzoquinone structure
potentially capable of producing ROS species. Cells treated with
17-AAG have previously been observed to produce ROS (39), and
we have shown here similar production in cells that are treated
with 17-DMAG (Fig. 4A). Inhibition of 17-DMAG–dependent ROS
production by NAC treatment prevented the reduction of
BRAF(V600E) levels and partially prevented MEK1/2 inhibition
(Fig. 3).
The benzoquinone moiety in 17-AAG/DMAG is not necessary for
inhibition of HSP90 chaperone function and can be reduced to
hydroquinone intracellularly by NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase I
(NQO1; ref. 40). The level of ROS production in cells by 17-AAG/
DMAG, therefore, could be determined by NQO1 expression levels:
If so, the activity of NQO1 may determine the effectiveness of
17-AAG/DMAG in cancer cells carrying BRAF(V600E) and possibly
other mutations.
We further found that 17-DMAG treatment inactivated the
kinase activity of nondegraded BRAF(V600E; Fig. 5). Because
BRAF(V600E) is a constitutively active mutant kinase independent
of any posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation,
these results indicate that 17-DMAG specifically inactivates
BRAF(V600E) through a mechanism(s) at least partially dependent
on ROS production. Redox-dependent alterations in activity have
been reported for many proteins including the c-fos/jun and HSF-1
transcription factors (41, 42). In the former case, REF1 catalyzed
reduction of c-fos leads to enhanced DNA binding and transcrip-

tional activity. More interestingly, the redox status of key cysteines
in HSF-1, an HSP90 client protein, is reported to regulate
transcriptional activity (41). The close proximity of both the ROS
generating geldanamycin drug and BRAF while simultaneously
bound to HSP90 would facilitate ROS-induced damage to the client
protein. Such damage could enhance both substrate degradation
and loss of enzymatic activity. The specific sensitivity of any
particular HSP90 substrate under this mechanism could be
sequence and structure dependent. In HT29 cells treated with
the menadione, BRAF (V600E) levels were only partially reduced,
whereas MEK level decreased dramatically (Fig. 4B). What is
interesting is that addition of the radicicol HSP90 inhibitor did not
further enhance the loss of either protein but did produce a
significant additional decline in BRAF activity as reflected in pMEK
levels. Thus, inhibition of HSP90 in the presence of ROS production
enhanced inhibition of BRAF kinase activity.
Our current understanding of the mechanism(s) by which 17AAG/DMAG alter the MAP kinase pathways is incomplete,
although these drugs have rapidly moved into clinical studies.
The antitumor effect of 17-AAG/DMAG is certainly mediated by
the inhibition of HSP90, which leads to the degradation of critical
oncogenic client proteins. However, geldanamycin and its derivatives, 17-AAG/DMAG, also produce ROS. ROS has been shown to
induce p38 stress kinase activation (39, 43). In addition, as we
showed in this report, ROS produced by 17-AAG/DMAG could also
contribute the antitumorigenic effect of 17-AAG/DMAG through
both the destabilization and the inactivation of BRAF(V600E).
