ABSTRACT
Caloric restriction (CR) was recently demonstrated by us to restrict ovarian cancer
growth in vivo. CR resulted in activation of energy regulating enzymes adenosine
monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) followed by downstream
inhibition of Akt-mTOR. In the present study, we investigated the effects of metformin
on ovarian cancer growth in mice fed a high energy diet (HED) and regular diet (RD)
and compared them to those seen with CR in an immunocompetent isogeneic mouse
model of ovarian cancer. Mice either on RD or HED diet bearing ovarian tumors were
treated with 200 mg/kg metformin in drinking water. Metformin treatment in RD and
HED mice resulted in a significant reduction in tumor burden in the peritoneum, liver,
kidney, spleen and bowel accompanied by decreased levels of growth factors (IGF-1,
insulin and leptin), inflammatory cytokines (MCP-1, IL-6) and VEGF in plasma and ascitic
fluid, akin to the CR diet mice. Metformin resulted in activation of AMPK and SIRT1 and
inhibition of pAkt and pmTOR, similar to CR. Thus metformin can closely mimic CR’s
tumor suppressing effects by inducing similar metabolic changes, providing further
evidence of its potential not only as a therapeutic drug but also as a preventive agent.

(CR) has been demonstrated to attenuate tumorogenesis
in various animal models [6]; on the other hand, a
positive energy state and obesity has been demonstrated
to be a contributing factor for multiple cancers including
gynecological cancers, such as endometrium [7], ovary
[8] and breast [9], as well as non-gynecological cancers,
including pancreas [10], liver [11] and colon cancer [12]. In
a previous study, we showed that a high energy diet (HED)
was associated with extensive ovarian tumor formation,
elevation of insulin, insulin growth factor (IGF-1) and higher
levels of inflammation markers in an isogeneic mouse model
of ovarian cancer. Conversely, CR diet exhibited less tumor
burden with a significant reduction in levels of insulin,
IGF-1 and inflammation markers [13]. The underlying
biologic mechanisms of calorie intake and tumorogenic/
anti-tumorogenic effects are not fully understood, but

INTRODUCTION
Epithelial ovarian cancer affects more than 239 000
women, with 152 000 deaths annually worldwide [1]. In
2014, 21 980 women were estimated to be diagnosed with
ovarian cancer and 14 270 died from this disease, making
ovarian cancer the fifth leading cause of cancer death in
women in the United States [2]. This high mortality rate is
due to diagnosis at an advanced stage signifying widespread
metastasis within the abdomen [3]. Cytoreductive
surgery and chemotherapy with platinum and taxanes
have increased the disease-free and overall survival, but
recurrence of the disease is common in these patients [4].
Energy balance is defined as the balance between
caloric intake and expenditure [5] and has been associated
with the pathogenesis of various cancers. Caloric restriction

it has been shown to be associated with modulation of
metabolic enzymes like adenosine monophosphate activated
kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) [14, 15]. AMPK is
a heterotrimeric serine/threonine protein kinase that acts
as an ultrasensitive cellular energy sensor maintaining the
energy balance within the cell [16] and has been shown to
have a role in inhibiting the proliferation of tumor cells [17].
AMPK performs its anti-tumorogenic activity in multiple
ways including cell cycle arrest associated with stabilization
of p53 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors [18–20] and
inhibition of cell growth by suppressing the synthesis of
cellular macromolecules, including fatty acids, triglycerides,
cholesterol, glycogen, ribosomal RNA and proteins [21,
22]. Mechanistically, AMPK inhibits the pro-oncogenic
mammalian target of rapamycin complex (mTOR) [16, 23]
and thus hampers the translation of many proteins essential
for rapid cell growth. Indirect effects of AMPK results in
attenuation of the insulin/IGF-1 pathways, which are known
to be upregulated in many cancers including ovarian cancer
[17]. SIRT1 is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)dependent histone deacetylase involved in the cell’s stress
adaption systems, DNA damage repair, cell metabolism and
survival [24, 25]. In mammals, SIRT1 expression, has been
shown to be induced by CR [15] and delay age and associated
diseases, such as cancer, atherosclerosis and diabetes [26–29].
Metformin is a member of the biguanide class of
antihyperglycemic agents and has been recently revealed
to have anti-tumorogenic effects [30, 31]. Metformin
decreases hepatic glucogenesis, increases insulin sensitivity,
enhances peripheral glucose uptake, and decreases glucose
absorption from the gastrointestinal tract [32]. On the
cellular level, metformin inhibits mitochondrial complex 1,
which interferes with oxidative phosphorylation, resulting
in decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production
and energetic stress [33]. Epidemiologic studies have
shown that metformin lowers cancer risk and improves
cancer outcomes in diabetic patients when compared with
patients treated with other types of antihyperglycemic
agents [34, 35]. Therefore, metformin has been repurposed

as therapy in gynecologic and non-gynecologic cancers
[36] and is currently being evaluated in various clinical
trials [36]. The most evaluated mechanism of metformin’s
antihyperglycemia and anti-tumor activity is the activation
of AMPK [36]. Metformin has also been demonstrated to
induce SIRT1 levels in hepatic cancer lines [24].
In this study, we investigated the downstream
effects of metformin on ovarian cancer growth using
immunocompetent mouse model under nutritional excess as
well as regular balanced dietary conditions and its similarity
with tumor inhibitory effects of CR to observe if metformin
can be utilized in lieu of CR to limit ovarian cancer growth.

RESULTS
Metformin decreases the tumor burden and
ascites volume
To investigate if metformin can reduce tumor
progression similar to CR, a set of HED and regular diet
(RD) fed mice were given metformin daily in drinking water
7 days after tumor implantation. As previously reported
[13], mice on HED had highest weight gain while the CR
diet (CRD) mice maintained their weight (Figure 1A).
Metformin intake did not significantly affect the weight gain
of HED or RD mice (Figure 1A), which was also reflected
in the end weights at the time of the sacrifice (Figure 1B).
Metformin treatment significantly reduced the ascites
accumulation in both RD and HED groups, but the highest
reduction was observed in the CRD group (Figure 1C).
Metformin treatment of the HED group was most effective
in reducing the tumor progression with significant reduction
of tumor burden in the peritoneum, diaphragm, bowel,
liver, kidney and spleen (Figure 2A–2F). In the RD group,
metformin reduced the tumor burden at the bowel, liver,
kidney and spleen. CRD group had the lowest tumor burden
at all organ sites (Figure 2A–2F). The hemotoxylin and
eosin evaluation of the tumor sections also showed reduced
tumor nodules at the diaphragm, peritoneum and adipose

ascites fluid of the mice. Metformin was most efficient
in reducing the levels of insulin, IGF-1 and leptin in both
the plasma and ascites of the HED group (Figure 4A–4C).
Adiponectin was significantly increased in the plasma
but not in the ascites by metformin in the HED mice
(Figure 4D). Metformin decreased IGF-1 and leptin
levels significantly in both the plasma and ascites of the
RD group, while insulin was reduced only in the ascites
(Figure 4A–4C). Adiponectin was significantly increased
in the plasma but not in the ascites by metformin in the RD
mice (Figure 4D). CRD mice still had the lowest levels
of IGF-1, insulin and leptin and increased adiponectin
as observed previously [13]. In general, HED fed mice
showed a tumor promoting environment while mice on
CRD showed the inverse profile. Metformin reversed most
of these tumor promoting effects of diet in HED and RD,
similar to the CRD group; however, CRD was the most

tissue (Figure 3A–3C) with metformin treatment in both
HED and RD groups, akin to CRD group. This was also
reflected in the decreased number of positive Ki-67 stained
cells observed in tumors from CRD and metformin treated
groups, quantified as Ki-67 index (Figure 3D). Overall, our
data showed that metformin decreased the ascites and tumor
burden in both the RD and HED groups significantly, similar
to CRD. However, the tumor reduction by metformin in
HED group was more pronounced than the tumor reduction
observed in the RD treatment group.

factors and hormones.

5Aii, 5Cii). Based on these results, it can be suggested
that metformin significantly alters the inflammatory and
angiogenic armamentarium of ovarian cancer cells, even
under the conditions of rich nutrition.

Metformin decreased the inflammatory
markers and angiogenic factors

Metformin induced AMPK and SIRT1

The role of inflammatory molecules (monocyte
chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1] and interleukin 6
[IL-6]) and angiogenic factors (vascular endothelial
growth factor [VEGF]) in ovarian tumorogenesis is
well established [37, 38], and the inhibition of these
markers by CRD has been recently demonstrated [13]. As
observed with growth factor levels, metformin had more
pronounced inhibition of these factors in HED group
compared to the RD group. Excluding plasma VEGF
(Figure 5Ci), the levels of MCP-1, IL-6 and VEGF were
significantly reduced by metformin (Figure 5A, 5B, 5Cii).
Metformin did not reduce IL-6 and VEGF in the plasma
of RD mice but significantly reduced MCP-1 (Figure
5Ai, Bi, 5Ci), while all 3 were significantly inhibited in
the ascitic fluid (Figure 5Aii, 5Bii, 5Cii). The CRD group
had lower levels of MCP-1, IL-6 and VEGF compared
to the HED and RD groups. Interestingly, metformin
decreased MCP-1 and VEGF levels in the ascites of the
RD and HED groups more significantly than CR (Figure
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

AMPK and SIRT are 2 enzymes involved in
regulation of energy metabolism and reported to mediate
the positive effects of CR [16, 25]. The CRD group
showed the strongest activation of phosphorylated acetylCoA carboxylase (pACC), a surrogate marker for AMPK
activation, while HED groups demonstrated almost no
phosphorylation of ACC as reported before [13] (Figure
6A, 6B). Metformin increased the pACC expression
significantly in RD and HED groups in both peritoneal and
adipose tumor tissue. A similar pattern was also observed
for SIRT1 expression in the tumor tissues (Figure 6D,
6E). Metformin treatment also activated AMPK and
SIRT1 in the liver, which was also associated with the
amelioration of the hepatic steatosis observed in the HED
group (Figure 6C, 6F). The quantification of the staining
intensity is represented as bar graphs (0–1: no or weak stain;
2: moderate stain and 3: strong stain), respective of each
panel. Taken together, these results suggest that metformin

AMPK and SIRT1 [21, 36, 39–41]. CRD mice had the
lowest and HED and RD mice had the highest expression
of pAkt (Figure 7A, 7B) and p-mTOR (Figure 7C, 7D)
as reported previously [13]. Metformin treatment reduced
both pAkt and p-mTOR expression in HED and RD
groups in the peritoneal and adipose tissue, similar to
CRD (Figure 7A–7D). The quantification of the staining
intensity is represented as bar graphs. This demonstrates
that metformin modulated common oncogenic factors with
CR, even under HED conditions.

DISCUSSION

promoting parameters under a high energy state in a
similar manner as that achieved by a CRD.
Obesity has been suggested to be a prognostic
factor for ovarian cancer. Having a body mass index
of more than 35 is associated with an increased risk of
mortality in ovarian cancer patients with a relative risk
of 1.5 [8]. In another study, being overweight or obese
in early adulthood is associated with a higher mortality
among patients with ovarian cancer [42]. Metformin
intake has been shown to decrease ovarian cancer risk in
diabetic patients [43], increase progression free survival

Our study shows that the levels of caloric intake
have significant effects on ovarian cancer growth and these
effects can be modulated by metformin. We revalidate that
the positive energy balance provided by HED aggravates
ovarian cancer by creating an environment that encourages
cancer growth, while a negative energy balance achieved
by 30% CR modulated the progression of ovarian tumors
in mice. Here, we have demonstrated that metformin
inhibits ovarian cancer growth by reorganizing the tumor

51, 52]. On the other hand, decreased adiponectin level
has been associated with the development of colorectal
[53], endometrium [54] and breast cancer [55]. Metformin
modifies these hormones and growth factor levels in
ovarian cancer-bearing mice fed HED or RD, which could
ultimately decrease the tumor burden. An interesting
observation is that metformin was the most efficient in
reducing insulin and IGF-1 levels in the HED group,
consistent with the highest tumor reduction by metformin
observed in the HED group. This might be secondary to
the fact that HED caused the most significant metabolic
and hormonal derangements, and metformin might be
more effective in a milieu where these derangements are
more profound, as opposed to RD. Similarly, metformin
also showed reduction in IL-6, MCP-1 and VEGF
levels, important factors shown to promote ovarian
tumor progression [56–60]. MCP-1 was reduced most

[44] and overall survival in women with ovarian cancer
[45]. While there are likely more than one mechanism for
these improved outcomes and inhibition of ovarian cancer
tumorogenesis, one of the mechanisms might be the
regulation of deranged host energy balance by metformin
related to adiposity, deregulated insulin-IGF-1 pathway or
chronic inflammation, which is often observed in diabetic
and cancer patients [46]. Increased energy balance, which
culminates in increased adiposity, changes the levels of
hormones such as insulin, adiponectin, leptin and IGF1 [47], which is also associated with cancer including
ovarian [48, 49]. Insulin has tumor-enhancing effects and
exerts these effects directly via insulin or indirectly via
IGF-1 receptors on preneoplastic and neoplastic cells or
other growth receptors [50], most frequently resulting
in activation of the P13K/Akt-mTOR pathway, a central
regulator of cell growth, proliferation and survival [6,

significantly by metformin, which was also observed in
our previous study, where metformin negated the effect of
adipocyte mediated MCP-1 production [61].
PI3K/Akt-mTOR pathway, one of the most
upregulated pathway observed in ovarian and other
cancers, is also the common downstream pathway
implicated in growth factor signaling and CR [62–64].
Akt stimulates the cell cycle progression, cell survival and
inhibits apoptosis [63, 65]. mTOR is a nutrition regulated
serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by the Akt
pathway but is inhibited by AMPK [66–68]. AMPK is
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

a serine/threonine protein kinase that acts as a sensor of
cellular energy status and is regulated by the AMP:ATP
levels [69]. Recent evidence suggests that AMPK also
regulates cell proliferation, cell growth, and autophagy
[70]. Our current and previous data showed that CR diet
increases AMPK activation along with decreased Akt
and mTOR activation. The same was achieved in the
HED and RD groups with metformin treatment. This is
consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated
that under nutrient-deprived conditions, which result
in energy depletion, AMPK is activated and transmits

both cancer and aging in various models [23, 86, 87].
This mTOR driven senescence can result in a selective
survival advantage to cancer cells [83]. We examined
mTOR mediated senescence in our model system by
staining for ɣH2A.X, a known senescence biomarker
[88, 89]. Nuclear expression of ɣH2A.X represents DNA
damage associated with aging [88]. We could only detect
its limited expression in HED tumors, while hardly any
expression was seen in tumor tissue of RD and none
was detected in CRD tumor tissue (Supplementary
Figure S1). This indicates that HED, which resulted in
hyperinsulinemia and increased activation of p-mTOR,
could also trigger senescence in cancer cells harbored by
the host. Further studies are required to delineate the exact
role of mTOR driven senescence under high energy or CR
environments in the tumor cells. Presently, the relationship
between senescence and cancer is very complex as cellular
senescence also serves to block tumorigenesis [90].
In summary, there are multiple pathways involved
in ovarian cancer pathogenesis which metformin
successfully modifies, resulting in decreased tumor
formation and spread in a manner very similar to CR
(Figure 8). Interestingly, metformin had a more significant
effect in the high energy background suggesting an
ability of metformin to be more effective in an increased
metabolically deranged tumor environment. Our study also
suggests that metformin has an effect not only on the tumor
environment but also on modulating the host environment
by making it less conducive for tumor growth, quite similar
to CR. Metformin may have utilization as a CR mimetic
to ameliorate aggressive tumor growth, as implementation
of CR in already debilitated cancer patients may not be
feasible. Our results strongly support future clinical
utilization of metformin as both a repurposing drug for
the treatment of ovarian cancer and also as a potential
preventative agent for select populations.

energetic stress signals to mTOR via tuberous sclerosis 2
and raptor, which ultimately inhibit mTOR activity [71].
SIRT1, another energy regulating enzyme, mediates the
longevity conferred by CR [15, 72]. SIRT1 also regulates
IGF-1, adiponectin and insulin levels in various tissues
[73]. In cancer pathogenesis; SIRT1 plays a bivalent role;
functional loss of SIRT1 promotes tumorogenesis because
of genomic instability [25]. However, SIRT1 has also
been associated with survival and proliferation of tumors
such as breast [74], gastric [75] and prostate cancer [76].
Metformin treatment increased SIRT1 expression in RD
and HED groups similar to the expression increased by
CRD. Molecular mechanism of regulation and interaction
of both these energy sensors has yet to be elucidated, but
recent data have shed a light on the interaction between the
AMPK and SIRT pathway [77, 78]. NAD+ synthesis has
been claimed to be a cellular mechanism to increase sirtuin
activity [77]. For instance, activation of hepatic AMPK by
metformin induces increased expression of nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase, which increases intracellular
NAD+/NADH ratio and ultimately activates SIRT1 [78].
On the other hand, AMPK does not affect the nicotinamide
phosphoribosyltransferase enzyme in endothelial cells
[79], which suggests that AMPK and SIRT1 use different
interaction pathways in various tissues. To better
understand the communication mechanisms between these
2 energy sensors in different types of tissues and different
types of malignancies, more research is required.
By modulating the dietary intake, we modulated the
host metabolism and consequently the host environment,
which had a significant effect on ovarian cancer
progression. This was demonstrated by the presence of
hepatic steatosis or deposition of fat within hepatocytes,
which is mostly prevalent in obese populations [80].
Hyperinsulinemia also contributes to hepatic steatosis
by increasing the expression of lipogenic enzymes and
diminishing fatty-acid oxidation [81]. We observed that
metformin ameliorates hepatic steatosis in the HED
liver, along with an increased expression of pACC and
SIRT1 (Figure 6C), a finding which is consistent with
previous studies [78–80]. AMPK also shows antilipogenic activity by suppressing lipogenic enzymes
(acetyl-CoA carboxylase, HMGCoA reductase, etc.) [82]
and lipogenesis transcription factors (sterol regulatory
element-binding proteins and carbohydrate response
element binding protein), which subsequently decreases
lipid accumulation [81].
CR is strongly linked to retarding both cancer and
aging, which share many common cellular and molecular
mechanisms [83]. The insulin-IGF-1 growth factor nexus
and inflammatory cytokines involved in both pathologies
converge down to activate mTOR, which is inhibited
both by CRD and metformin [83, 84]. mTOR is known
to orchestrate the process of ‘geroconversion’, whereby
it places a cell into senescence [85]. Inhibition of mTOR
by rapamycin or its analogs has been shown to prevent

Figure 8: Proposed mechanism of metformin effect on ovarian cancer. Metformin and CR act in a similar manner to curtail
ovarian cancer growth, while HED aggravates ovarian cancer. Both metformin and CR result in activation of AMPK and SIRT1. SIRT1
activation could occur independently or as a consequence of AMPK activation. Activation of these metabolic enzymes is linked to reduction
in growth factors and hormones like insulin, IGF-1 and leptin, which leads to inhibition in the protein kinase B-mammalian target of
rapamycin (Akt-mTOR) pathway activation resulting in decreased ovarian tumor growth. Inhibition of cytokines like MCP-1 and IL-6 and
the angiogenic factor VEGF reduces inflammation and angiogenesis, which also leads to limited ovarian tumor growth. Overall, metformin
and CR have very similar effects in modulating the deranged tumor environment milieu and in effect restricts ovarian cancer progression.

observed; 1: 1 nodule observed; 2: 2 to 5 nodules and 3:
more than 5 nodules observed per organ [13]. Scoring was
performed in a blinded manner by 2 individuals including
a gynecology oncology fellow (ZW).

Tumor generation
Six-week-old female C57B6 mice were weighed
and randomized into the 3 dietary treatment groups as
described above: (1) RD (n = 20), (2) HED (n = 20) and
(3) CRD (n = 10). Mice were weighed twice a week. After
30 days of respective diet, 5 x 106 ID-8 mouse ovarian
cancer cells in 200 μl phosphate-buffered saline were
injected into the peritoneal cavity of the mice [13]. Post-7
days of tumor implantation, 1 set of mice from the RD
and HED groups (n = 10) was given 200 mg/body weight

Immunohistochemistry
After excising the tumor tissues and other
organ tissue from mice, specimens were fixed in 10%
formaldehyde for 48 hours and paraffin-embedded.
Consecutive sections of 4 micron thick were cut
and processed for hematoxylin and eosin staining;
immunohistochemistry for pACC (cat. no. 3661, used
at 1:100), p-mTOR (cat. No: 2976, used at 1:50), pAkt
(Ser473, cat. No: 4060 used at 1:50), SIRT1 (cat no:
15404, used at 1:100) and Ki-67 (cat. No: ab15580,
used at 1:100), ɣH2A.X (cat no:9718, used at 1:100).
Antibodies to pACC, p-mTOR, pAkt, and ɣH2A.X
were from Cell Signaling Technology (Denver, MA).
Ki-67 was from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). p16 was
from Proteintech (cat. No: 10883–1-AP, used at 1:200;
Proteintech Group, Chicago, IL). SIRT1 was from Santa
Cruz Biotech (Santa Cruz, CA). Solutions obtained
from Dako Cytomation (Carpinteria, CA) were used for
performing immunostaining as described before [13, 93].
The slides were examined under a light microscope, and
representative pictures were taken from a minimum of 3
slides of each group [93]. The quantification of the stain
intensity was performed by assigning a score of 0–1 for
no or weak stain; 2 for moderate stain and 3 for strong
stain. All slides were examined in a blinded manner by 2
individuals, including a pathologist (RA).
