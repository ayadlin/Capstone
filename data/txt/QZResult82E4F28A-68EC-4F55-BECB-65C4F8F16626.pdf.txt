Abstract
Crizotinib is the standard of care for advanced non–small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring the anaplastic
lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion gene, but resistance invariably
develops. Unlike crizotinib, alectinib is a selective ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with more potent antitumor effects
and a favorable toxicity proﬁle, even in crizotinib-resistant
cases. However, acquired resistance to alectinib, as for other
TKIs, remains a limitation of its efﬁcacy. Therefore, we investigated the mechanisms by which human NSCLC cells acquire
resistance to alectinib. We established two alectinib-resistant
cell lines that did not harbor the secondary ALK mutations
frequently occurring in crizotinib-resistant cells. One cell line
lost the EML4-ALK fusion gene, but exhibited increased activation of insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and

human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3), and overexpressed the HER3 ligand neuregulin 1. Accordingly, pharmacologic inhibition of IGF1R and HER3 signaling overcame
resistance to alectinib in this cell line. The second alectinibresistant cell line displayed stimulated HGF autocrine signaling that promoted MET activation and remained sensitive to
crizotinib treatment. Taken together, our ﬁndings reveal two
novel mechanisms underlying alectinib resistance that are
caused by the activation of alternative tyrosine kinase receptors rather than by secondary ALK mutations. These studies
may guide the development of comprehensive treatment
strategies that take into consideration the various approaches
ALK-positive lung tumors use to withstand therapeutic insult.

Introduction

on treatment outcomes. The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium
in the United States reported a median survival from the time of
diagnosis of metastatic disease of 4.2 years in patients with lung
adenocarcinomas harboring the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)
fusion gene when appropriate chemotherapies with molecular
targeted agents were used (1). Soon after the discovery of EML4ALK (2), Sakamoto and colleagues developed a selective tyrosine
kinase inhibitor (TKI) for ALK called alectinib (3). The high
selectivity of alectinib for ALK in preclinical data from Japanese
phase-II trials indicated its high objective response rate (93.5%),
long median progression-free survival (27.7 months), and favorable toxicity proﬁle (4, 5). Based on these data, Japan was the ﬁrst
country to approve the use of alectinib. This agent is also effective
in cases resistant to crizotinib, which is a ﬁrst-generation ALK-TKI,
including cases with metastasis to the central nervous system (6–
9). Based on these positive results, alectinib received breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA. Two randomized clinical trials comparing alectinib with crizotinib in ﬁrst- and secondline settings are currently underway.
Alectinib is expected to be a mainstay treatment for ALKpositive lung cancer in the future, but almost all patients
eventually acquire resistance to alectinib as they would to
crizotinib. The mechanisms of acquired resistance to crizotinib
have been explored extensively and include secondary ALK
mutations (10–15), ALK ampliﬁcation (11), and bypass track
activation via proteins, such as the human epidermal growth

Targeted therapies for lung cancers harboring driver oncogenes
are generally recognized because of the large inﬂuence they have

Resistance Mechanisms to Selective ALK-TKI Alectinib

factor receptor (HER) family (13–15), v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman
4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (14), Kirsten rat
sarcoma 2 viral oncogene homolog (15), and insulin-like
growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R; ref. 16). Crizotinib inhibits
MET more strongly than ALK, so cells acquire resistance to the
MET inhibitor as well as the ALK inhibitor presumably. Because
alectinib is a selective TKI for ALK, unlike crizotinib, the
mechanisms of resistance to the two drugs presumably differ.
Therefore, we elucidated the mechanisms of alectinib resistance
to discover strategies to overcome such resistance.
In this study, we used the H2228 and ABC-11 cell lines, which
harbor EML4-ALK, to comprehensively investigate the mechanisms of acquired resistance to alectinib. Different from previously
reported alectinib-resistant cell lines, neither of these resistant cell
lines possess secondary ALK mutations (17). Discovering the
mechanisms of resistance to alectinib with the goal of overcoming
alectinib resistance will provide new insight into resistance to
ALK-TKIs.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines and reagents
The PC-9 cells (epidermal growth factor receptor: EGFR Ex19 del
E746_A750) were purchased from the European Collection of Cell
Cultures in 2014. The H2228 (EML4-ALK variant 3a/b E6; A20) cell
line was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection in
2008. They were authenticated using short tandem repeat analysis
at each cell bank and resuscitated at least every 6 months from
frozen master stocks. The ABC-11 (EML4-ALK variant 3b E6; A20)
cell line was established at Okayama University from the pleural
effusion of a patient with ALK inhibitor–na€ve non–small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) harboring EML4-ALK (18) in 2011. Cells were
cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10%
heat-inactivated FBS at 37.0 C in 5% CO2.
Alectinib was kindly provided by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.,
Ltd. OSI-906 was kindly donated by Dr. Ebi (Kanazawa University, Ishikawa, Japan). Anti-human HGF-neutralizing antibody
and human recombinant HGF were prepared as described previously (19). Human neuregulin 1 (NRG1) was purchased from
Cell Signaling Technology, erlotinib from ChemieTek, and
SGX325 and crizotinib from Selleck Chemicals.
Detection of EML4-ALK
IHC and FISH were performed on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁnembedded samples using an ALK antibody (5A4; Abcam) and
a break-apart probe for the ALK gene (Vysis LSI ALK Break Apart
Rearrangement Probe; Abbott Laboratories)at Hachioji Laboratories, SRL Inc, Tokyo, Japan. FISH-positive cases were deﬁned as
>15% split signals in cells. EML4-ALK mRNA expression was
examined by RT-PCR. The primer sequences used have been
described previously (20).
Drug sensitivity assays
Cells (2,000–3,000/well) were seeded in 96-well plates and
cultured for 96 hours. Viable cells were measured using the
modiﬁed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetra-zolium
bromide (MTT) assay (21, 22).
Western blotting and receptor tyrosine kinase array
Western blotting was conducted as described previously (23).

ABCG2), and HGF mRNA expression were analyzed by qRT-PCR
of cDNA using primer and probe sets and the TaqMan Universal
PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The primer and probe set information is
provided in Supplementary Table S2B.
PCR ampliﬁcation was performed using the StepOne Plus RealTime PCR instrument (Applied Biosystems), and gene dosage was
calculated using a standard curve. The copy-number ratio of the
target gene to GAPDH and their gene expression were calculated.
Values for the resistant clones are expressed relative to the corresponding values for parental cells.
mRNA expression proﬁle analysis
mRNA was proﬁled using Custom Microarray 4  44 K arrays
(Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol.
The original expression data have been submitted to Gene Expression Omnibus. The accession number is GSE73167.
Quantiﬁcation of HGF by ELISA
Human HGF levels were determined using a Human Total HGF
Assay kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co.). Resistant clone
data are expressed relative to the corresponding values for parental
cells.
Conditioned medium
ABC-11/CHR3 cells (2  106/10 mL) were seeded and cultured
in a ﬂask in the absence of alectinib. The supernatant was
harvested after 48 hours and centrifuged. Conditioned medium
was prepared by mixing equal parts of the supernatant and fresh
medium.
Xenograft models
Female BALB/c nu/nu mice were purchased at 7 weeks of age
from Charles River Laboratories, Japan. Cells (2  106) were
injected subcutaneously into the backs of the mice. Treatment was
started when the tumor reached a certain volume (day 0). Mice
were randomized to receive vehicle, alectinib (10 mg/kg/day), or
crizotinib (50 mg/kg/day; refs. 3, 24, 25) for the same duration.
Vehicle and drugs were administered orally once a day every third
day by gavage. The tumor volume (width2  length/2) was
determined periodically. Statistical data were analyzed on day 19.

Statistical analysis
All data were expressed as the mean  SE. All experiments
were performed three times, and statistical analysis was determined by the two-tailed paired Student t test. P value of
<0.05 was considered signiﬁcant ( , P < 0.05;  , P < 0.01;
and  , P < 0.001, respectively).

We cultured H2228/CHR clones in the absence of alectinib for
1 year (designated H2228/CHR-r1–r3). The EML4-ALK fusion
gene status was determined by multiplex RT-PCR and exon array
analyses in the H2228/CHR-r cell lines (Mitsubishi Chemical
Medience), and its loss was persistent (data not shown).

Results
Establishing two alectinib-resistant cell lines using the doseescalation method
We established the H2228/CHR and ABC-11/CHR alectinibresistant cell lines from H2228 and ABC-11 cells, respectively,
using a well-established dose-escalation method to explore the
mechanisms underlying acquired resistance to alectinib comprehensively (Supplementary Fig. S1A; refs. 26, 27). Both cell lines
became resistant within 5 months and then grew in the presence
of 1 mmol/L alectinib.
As shown in Table 1, the H2228/CHR and ABC-11/CHR cells
were 117- and 40-fold more resistant than was each parental cell
line, respectively, in terms of relative resistance determined by the
IC50 values. H2228/CHR cells also exhibited resistance to crizotinib, whereas ABC-11/CHR cells exhibited collateral sensitivity to
crizotinib, which inhibited both ALK and MET.
No morphologic changes were detected compared with the
parental cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C). Both resistant
cell lines maintained downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation
even in the presence of 10 mmol/L alectinib. Surprisingly, the ALK
protein was lost in H2228/CHR cells, but not in ABC-11/CHR
cells (Fig. 1A). We conﬁrmed that the resistant and parental cells
had the same origin using PCR analysis of short tandem repeats
(Supplementary Fig. S2A and S2B).

Survival of alectinib-resistant cells was maintained by activated
IGF1R and HER3 signaling instead of EML4-ALK
As the EML4-ALK driver oncogene was lost in the H2228/CHR
clones, we used a phospho-RTK array to identify tyrosine kinase
receptors that contribute to survival. The results showed increased
IGF1R and HER3 phosphorylation levels in H2228/CHR clones
compared with parental H2228 cells (Fig. 2A). IGF1R upregulation
was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting in H2228/CHR
clones (Fig. 2B and C), but no changes in HER3 expression were
observed (data not shown). Subsequently, we conducted mRNA
array analysis to reveal high expression of several genes, which were
more than 2-fold higher in H2228/CHR1 cells than parental
H2228 cells. Remarkably, the NRG1, ligand of HER3 (28), was
highly expressed in all resistant clones (Fig. 2D). We conﬁrmed that
external NRG1 enhanced HER3 phosphorylation and that downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation were maintained regardless
of treating parental cells with alectinib (Fig. 2E). In addition, both
EGFR and HER3 phosphorylation were inhibited by the selective
EGFR inhibitor erlotinib in H2228/CHR cells (Fig. 3A). These
results suggest that HER3 may be activated through NRG1 and
EGFR, leading to resistance to alectinib in H2228/CHR cells.
Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that alectinib-resistant
cells maintain survival by activating the IGF1R and NRG1/HER3
pathways rather than via EML4-ALK driver oncogene signaling.

Loss of the EML4-ALK protein in H2228 cells following
exposure to alectinib
As we were interested in H2228/CHR cells, which lack the ALK
protein, weexamined cellsthat were serially treatedwith 150nmol/L
or 600 nmol/L alectinib (designated H2228/150 nmol/L and
H2228/600 nmol/L, respectively). ALK expression gradually
decreased in H2228/150 nmol/L cells and was lost eventually (Fig.
1B). IHC revealed that pre-existing ALK-negative cells became dominant during chronic exposure to alectinib (Fig. 1C). In parallel with
loss of the ALK protein, sensitivity to alectinib decreased (Fig. 1D).
To elucidate the resistance mechanism more precisely, we
cloned three H2228/CHR sublines (designated H2228/CHR-1–
3) from H2228/CHR cells by single-cell cloning. All clones
exhibited the same characteristics as those of H2228/CHR,
including resistance to alectinib and crizotinib and loss of ALK
protein expression (Supplementary Fig. S3A and S3B). The
statuses of the ALK protein and the EML4-ALK fusion gene in
the H2228/CHR clones were conﬁrmed by IHC, RT-PCR, and
FISH (Fig. 1E–G).

Inhibition of IGF1R and HER3 overcomes alectinib resistance
As the survival of H2228/CHR clones that have lost EML4-ALK
could depend on IGF1R and HER3 signaling, we examined
whether inhibiting IGF1R or HER3 was effective for the
H2228/CHR1-resistant clone. Although OSI-906 monotherapy
(IGF1R inhibitor) or erlotinib (EGFR inhibitor) weakly suppressed survival signaling (AKT and ERK phosphorylation), the
combination of OSI-906 and erlotinib clearly downregulated AKT
survival signaling more remarkably than that of ERK1/2 (Fig. 3A).
The combined therapy was signiﬁcantly more effective for inhibiting growth of H2228/CHR1 cells than was either of the single
treatments (Fig. 3B). We conclude that H2228/CHR cells became
resistant to alectinib due to loss of the EML4-ALK driver oncogene
and activation of alternative pathways, including IGF1R and
NRG1/HER3 signaling.
The mRNA array results showed that several lung cancer stem
cell–related markers (29) were highly expressed in the H2228/
CHR clones. We conﬁrmed upregulation of ALDH1A1, SMO, and
ABCG2 in the H2228/CHR clones compared with that in parental

Activated MET caused by HGF autocrine stimulation leads to
alectinib resistance
To identify the main cause of MET activation, we focused on
expression of HGF, which is a MET ligand. The HGF gene was
signiﬁcantly ampliﬁed in each of the ABC-11/CHR clones (Fig.
4D). mRNA expression increased markedly in the ABC-11/CHR
clones (Fig. 4E). Consistent with this, HGF protein expression also
increased in both cancer cell lines (Fig. 4F) and in the culture

supernatants of ABC-11/CHR cells (Fig. 4G). Extrinsic HGF or
conditioned medium led to resistance to alectinib in parental
ABC-11 and H2228 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B). In
addition, extrinsic HGF or conditioned medium activated MET in
ABC-11 cells, which was suppressed by the anti-HGF antibody
(Fig. 4H and I). Combined alectinib and anti-HGF antibody
treatment decreased the levels of phosphorylated MET and downstream signaling in ABC-11/CHR3 cells (Fig. 4J). The anti-HGF
antibody inhibited growth dose-dependently, and combined
therapy with alectinib was effective in ABC-11/CHR3 cells (Fig.
4K). Taken together, these results indicate that the cells acquired
resistance to alectinib by activating MET resulting from HGF

We continued culturing the ABC-11/CHR clones without alectinib for 3 months (designated ABC-11/CHR-r1–r3) to evaluate
the reversibility of autocrine HGF secretion. All of the ABC-11/
CHR-r clones continued to secrete HGF (Supplementary Fig. S7A)
and remained resistant to alectinib but sensitive to crizotinib
(Supplementary Fig. S7B).
Crizotinib overcomes resistance to alectinib
We examined whether inhibiting MET signaling was effective
for overcoming alectinib resistance. The selective MET inhibitor
SGX523 signiﬁcantly inhibited growth of ABC-11/CHR3 cells
(Fig. 5A). In addition, SGX523 combined with alectinib was more
sensitive than SGX523 monotherapy (SGX523 vs. SGX523 þ
alectinib; P ¼ 0.01). ABC-11/CHR3 cells exhibited high sensitivity
to crizotinib, which inhibits both MET and ALK. MET and ALK
phosphorylation and downstream AKT and ERK phosphorylation
were suppressed markedly in the presence of 0.1 mmol/L crizotinib (Fig. 5B).
We also examined the effect of crizotinib in xenograft models.
ABC-11 and ABC-11/CHR xenografts were treated with vehicle,
alectinib, or crizotinib. ABC-11 and ABC-11/CHR xenograft
tumors in vehicle-treated mice grew at the same rate. Alectinib
led to almost complete inhibition of ABC-11 tumors and had a
stronger effect than that of crizotinib (Fig. 5C, left top). In contrast,
alectinib had little effect on ABC-11/CHR tumors (Fig. 5C, right
top), which were extremely sensitive to crizotinib. No differences
in body weight were observed among the vehicle-, alectinib-, and
crizotinib-treated mice (Fig. 5C, bottom). Crizotinib almost
completely blocked growth of ABC-11/CHR xenograft tumors

for >30 days (Supplementary Fig. S8). These results suggest that
ﬁrst-generation crizotinib can overcome resistance to alectinib.
HGF was overexpressed in an alectinib-refractory patient
We obtained clinical samples from a 33-year-old female
never-smoker with advanced NSCLC harboring the ALK fusion
gene to determine if our ﬁndings are clinically relevant. Her
tumor responded well to alectinib and subsequently acquired
resistance. We performed IHC to detect HGF expression using
the pre- and postalectinib biopsied samples. Consistent with
our preclinical data, HGF was overexpressed in the postalectinib specimen but not in the prealectinib specimen (Fig. 5D).
These results suggest that our ﬁndings are not limited to a
preclinical setting.

Discussion
We established two alectinib-resistant cell lines to investigate
the acquired resistance phenomenon in NSCLC harboring EML4ALK. In contrast with previous studies, neither of the resistant cell
lines had a secondary ALK mutation. "Mechanism 1" involves loss
of EML4-ALK and activation of IGF1R and NRG1/HER3. "Mechanism 2" contains activation of MET as a result of autocrine
stimulation by HGF (Fig. 6).
Alectinib-resistant H2228/CHR cells lost the EML4-ALK driver
oncogene, and survival was completely independent of ALK
signaling. Alternatively, IGF1R and NRG1/HER3 pathway were
activated. Given that activated HER3 and overexpression of NRG1
have been described previously in the setting of crizotinib

alectinib, and sensitivity to alectinib declined in parallel with loss
of the ALK protein, suggesting that the IHC ALK-positive ratio
might reﬂect efﬁcacy to alectinib. More research using clinical
samples is needed to conﬁrm this hypothesis. Loss of the EML4ALK fusion gene has also been reported in crizotinib-refractory
patients (15, 30), so future research should not be limited to in
vitro experiments. Geﬁtinib-resistant cells also showed loss of the
EGFR driver oncogene and acquired stem cell–like properties
(31). Consistent with this ﬁnding, H2228/CHR cells with loss
of EML4-ALK demonstrated stem cell–like characteristics with
high ALDH1A1, SMO, and ABCG2 expression. Alectinib-resistant
cells might acquire a stem cell–like phenotype through loss of the
driver oncogene.
The other resistant cell line, ABC-11/CHR, exhibited activated MET as a result of autocrine stimulation by HGF and
sensitivity to the MET inhibitor. HGF causes acquired resistance
to anticancer kinase inhibitors in oncogene-addicted cancer
cells and has been presumed to be secreted into the tumor
microenvironment by stromal cells, such as ﬁbroblasts (19, 32–
35). In contrast, we demonstrated that ABC-11 cells acquired
the ability to secrete HGF from cancer cells themselves in an
autocrine manner, but not stromal cells, resulting in resistance
to alectinib. In addition, ABC-11/CHR cells exhibited signiﬁcant collateral sensitivity to crizotinib. Based on these data, a
phase II trial of crizotinib for alectinib-refractory patients
according to HGF and MET status is ongoing (UMIN registration number 000015984). A recent case report described a
patient who acquired resistance to alectinib thorough MET
ampliﬁcation and exhibited a dramatic response to crizotinib
(36). Both this case and our model are similar, as acquired
resistance is caused by activation of the MET pathway and
sensitivity to crizotinib. Our model presumes that the MET
pathway is activated by HGF autocrine without ampliﬁcation of

1514 Cancer Res; 76(6) March 15, 2016

MET. We could not ﬁnd such a case resistant to alectinib by
checking MET ampliﬁcation alone. Therefore, we should prepare to detect two different resistance mechanisms via the MET
pathway.
Notably, H2228/CHR cells were not dependent on ALK signaling; thus, ALK-TKI was not effective at all. On the other hand,
ABC-11/CHR cells were dependent on ALK signaling; thus, a dual
MET and ALK inhibitor was more effective than was a MET
inhibitor alone. Therefore, we need to assess the necessity of
blocking ALK signaling in tumor specimens obtained by re-biopsy
in patients refractory to alectinib.
Although an ALK secondary mutation is a common mechanism in patients with acquired resistance to crizotinib and
accounts for approximately 30% of cases (37), such a mutation
did not appear in our alectinib-resistant cell lines. Alectinib
demonstrates selective and strong binding afﬁnity [dissociation
constant (Kd), 2.4 nmol/L; ref. 3] compared with that of the
multitarget TKI crizotinib (Kd, 3.3 nmol/L; ref. 38). Nilotinib is
a more potent and selective TKI for BCR-ABL than is imatinib in
patients with chronic myeloid leukemia. A randomized clinical
trial revealed that the incidence of secondary mutations caused
by nilotinib treatment was approximately half than that by
imatinib treatment (39). Therefore, we presume that bypass
track activation occurs more frequently than do secondary
mutations when a selective and strong TKI is used. Katayama
and colleagues reported ALK secondary mutations as part of an
alectinib-resistance mechanism: a V1180L ALK gatekeeper
mutation in an in vitro experiment and an I1171T ALK mutation
in a tumor from a patient who was treated with crizotinib
followed by alectinib (17). More comprehensive research using
clinical samples derived from alectinib-refractory patients is
needed to conﬁrm our speculation.
In summary, we elucidated novel mechanisms of resistance to
alectinib using two types of ALK-positive cell lines. One cell line
showed loss of EML4-ALK, and both cell lines showed activated
alternative tyrosine kinase receptors that led to alectinib resistance. An IGF1R inhibitor combined with an EGFR inhibitor or
crizotinib alone overcame the resistance. Our ﬁndings provide
insight into next-generation therapeutic strategies for patients
with ALK-positive lung cancer.
