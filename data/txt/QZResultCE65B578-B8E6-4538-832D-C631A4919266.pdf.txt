Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma*

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is a highly vascularized cancer resistant to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Antiangiogenic therapy has achieved some effectiveness against this unique malignancy. The complexity of the tumor vasculature in CCRCC has led to differences in correlating tumor
microvessel density with patient prognosis. The authors’ recent findings demonstrated that there were at
least 2 major categories of tumor vessels in CCRCC—namely, undifferentiated and differentiated—correlating with patient prognosis in contrasting ways, with higher undifferentiated vessel density indicating poorer
prognosis, and higher differentiated vessel density correlating with better prognosis. Furthermore, the
presence of pericytes supporting the differentiated vessels varied in CCRCC. The distributions of pericyte
coverage and differentiated vessels in CCRCC were uneven. The tumor margin had a higher pericyte coverage rate for differentiated vessels than did the inner tumor area. The uneven distributions of pericyte coverage and differentiated vessels in CCRCC prompted the authors to revisit the mechanism of tumor central
necrosis, which was also known to be a prognostic indicator for CCRCC. The discrepancy of prognostic correlation between protein and messenger RNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in CCRCC was
discussed. The complexity of the tumor vasculature in CCRCC also led the authors to begin to re-evaluate
the therapeutic effects of antiangiogenic agents for each type of tumor vessel, which will in turn significantly broaden understanding of tumor angiogenesis and improve therapeutic effect. Cancer 2009;115(10

Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) is a highly vascularized malignancy. As evaluated by 2-phase
multidetector computed tomography angiography, CCRCC is found to be able to develop an aberrant
capsular vascular supply with outflow through an ovarian vein or testicular vein,1 although positron emission tomography shows that blood perfusion of the tumor is reduced compared with normal kidney tissues.2 Our expression profiling study also indicated that the expression level of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF; a potent proangiogenesis factor) in CCRCC is 5-fold higher than in other types of kidney

neoplasm.3 To our knowledge, the complexity of the
tumor vasculature in CCRCC has been noted previously,4
but its underlying biological mechanism remains
unknown. The resistance of CCRCC cells to most of the
existing cytotoxic drugs has prompted the use of novel
agents targeting angiogenesis, several of which are either
recently approved for therapeutic use or undergoing
preclinical or clinical evaluations.5-7 The promising yet
limited efficacy of the current antiangiogenic strategy
points to the need to further elucidate the complexity of
CCRCC vasculature. Herein, we discuss several important issues regarding the vasculature of, and angiogenesis
in, CCRCC.

Differential Analysis of Tumor Vasculature
Microvessel density (MVD) is usually used as an indicator
of tumor angiogenesis. In the majority of solid tumors,
higher MDC is correlated with poorer prognosis.8 In the
patients with hematologic malignancies, increased bone
marrow MVD has been found.9-11 Higher bone marrow
MVD is reported to correlate with more advanced hematologic malignancies12 and shorter progression-free
survival in patients with multiple myeloma.13 However,
intratumoral MVD has been a controversial prognostic
predictor for CCRCC. As summarized in Table 1, higher
MVD has been reported in many studies to be a favorable
Cancer

prognostic factor (eg, a higher blood vessel density in
CCRCC is correlated with a better prognosis or longer
patient survival).4,14-22 However, other studies have
reported opposite results correlating higher MVD with
poorer prognosis,23-28 whereas others have been unable to
find a significant prognostic role for MVD.29-33 The controversy could result from many nonmechanistic factors,
including sample size, sampling bias, the different blood
vessel markers chosen for immunohistochemical (IHC)
characterization, the quality of IHC staining, the methods
of vasculature quantification, and the methods of interpretation. However, one other important cause may be
that, without differential analysis, blood vessels in
CCRCC may be regarded as a single type of vessel having
presumably similar functions throughout, which might
not accurately reflect the functional diversity of different
types of microvessels.
Our recent study demonstrated that within CCRCC
there are at least 2 major categories of blood vessels having
contrasting prognostic implications: the undifferentiated
vessels (expressing CD31 but not CD34) and the differentiated vessels (expressing both CD31 and CD34).34 The
morphologic characteristics of undifferentiated vessels
include no (or a small) lumen, a thicker vessel wall, and
smaller size when compared with differentiated vessels. A
higher density of undifferentiated vessels is correlated
with shorter patient survival, higher grade tumors, and a
2283

Original Article

more advanced primary tumor. Conversely, a higher density of differentiated vessels in CCRCC is correlated with
longer patient survival, low tumor grade, and earlier
T classification. These findings suggest that 1) the vasculature in CCRCC should not be regarded as 1 single type of
vessel with presumably similar biologic roles in tumor
progression; and 2) by differential analysis of the vasculature, we might be able to identify the key types of tumor
vessels corresponding to the aggressiveness of tumor
behaviors and perhaps response or resistance to antiangiogenic agents.
Tumor blood volume can be measured using
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).35
Using gadopentetate dimeglumine, which can provide
contrast enhancement in tumors with functioning abnormal vasculature, Yabuki et al reported a significant tendency for higher grade CCRCCs to present with less
enhancement and lower grade tumors to present with better enhancement.36 In this study, 43 of 54 patients had
CCRCCs. Bolus injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine
was performed for MRI. The enhancement of the solid
part of the tumor was compared with the renal cortex of
the same kidney. The nuclear grading system was used
with grade 1 indicating a tumor with a nucleus smaller
than that of a normal tubular cell nucleus, grade 2 indicating a tumor with a nucleus of similar size, and grade 3
indicating a tumor with a larger nucleus. The authors
found a significant correlation between grade 3 tumors
and ‘‘no or very little enhancement’’ in both dynamic
early-phase and late-phase images, suggesting less blood
volume in high-grade tumors. This finding supports the
notion that the differentiated vessels, which are less common in high-grade tumors and more frequent in lowgrade tumors, are the primary blood supplier to CCRCC.

Impact of Pericytes on Prognosis
Mature blood vessels are usually covered/bounded by
pericytes. The recruitment of pericytes is essential for the
formation and stabilization of mature blood vessels.37-39
Therefore, pericyte coverage is regarded as an indicator of
vascular maturation. The absence of pericyte coverage in
tumor vasculature has been found to be associated with
metastasis and poorer prognosis in patients with colorectal
cancer.40 Our study of CCRCC revealed that the undifferentiated microvessels, which are correlated with poor
2284

prognosis, are not covered by pericytes.34 Irregular pericyte coverage is found in a portion of the differentiated
vessels. These findings indicate that, in terms of vascular
maturation in CCRCC, undifferentiated vessels are completely immature, whereas differentiated vessels could be
further divided into differentiated mature vessels and differentiated immature vessels, depending on the presence
of pericyte coverage.
In our most recent study using quantitative analyses
of double IHC-stained images, the presence of pericytes
supporting the differentiated vessels in CCRCC has been
further analyzed. The distribution of pericytes is uneven
in the tumor mass, with abundant pericytes noted in the
peripheral tumor area and fewer pericytes in the inner
tumor area, resulting in a higher pericyte coverage rate
on the differentiated vessels in the tumor rim. Consistent
with the supporting role of pericytes to mature blood
vessels, a higher density of differentiated vessels is found
in the peripheral tumor area in contrast to the inner tumor area. These results suggest that pericyte coverage
might play an important role in tumor progression, and
refined differential analysis of CCRCC vasculature
might disclose more useful targets for therapeutic
intervention.

Revisiting the Concept of Central
Necrosis in CCRCC
Tumor necrosis is present in approximately 50% of all
CCRCCs, with a prevalence in high-grade tumors,41 and
is recognized as an important prognostic indicator.4,41-43
Recently, a scoring system including the stage, size, grade,
and necrosis of the tumor (SSIGN model) has been
reported to better predict the outcome of patients with
CCRCC.44 Although the association between an
increased number of infiltrating lymphocytes and larger
necrotic areas suggests a possible role of the host immune
response in CCRCC necrosis, its precise mechanism
remains unclear.45
Traditionally, tumor necrosis is believed to be present when tumors outgrow their blood supply. However,
the study by Hemmerlein et al revealed that highly proliferative renal cell carcinomas outgrow their vascular supply, resulting in chronic hypoxia, which in turn induces a
decrease in proliferation and an increase in VEGF expression without significant necrosis or apoptosis.46
Cancer

Complexity of Tumor Vasculature in CCRCC/Qian et al

Therefore, it is suggested that tumor necrosis in CCRCC
is more likely induced by acute hypoxia due to immature
microvessels. In addition, challenging the conventional
concept, Holash et al demonstrated in their animal model
that glioma cells can co-opt normal host vessels for initial
tumor growth.47 The co-opted vessels will regress along
with the out-growth of the tumor, resulting in central
necrosis of the expanding tumor. They even suggest that
angiopoietin-2 and VEGF cooperate in the regression of
the co-opted vessels. The integration of normal high
endothelial venules into the tumor vasculature in breast
cancer metastatic to the axillary lymph nodes has also
been demonstrated in our study.48 It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the outgrowth of CCRCC, which
is initiated in blood vessel-rich kidney tissue, may also be
involved in integrating the pre-existing normal vessels
into its tumor vasculature. If this hypothesis is true, then
the fate of the integrated pre-existing vessels in the tumor
vasculature could be the key factor for the presence of
necrosis in CCRCC.
From our observation, between the tumor rim with
a high density of differentiated vessels and the area of central necrosis, there usually is a transitional area with fewer
or no pericytes. As the necrotic area expands outward, the
pericyte-free zone will eventually be overtaken by the
necrotic area. In animal models, pericytes migrate away
from brain microvessels in response to hypoxia or brain
trauma.49,50 It has been found that loss of pericytes precedes damage to endothelial cells,51 and microvascular
injury precedes tumor necrosis.52 Therefore, we hypothesized that loss of pericyte coverage of differentiated vessels
causes dysfunction of the differentiated vessels, which in
turn precedes necrosis in CCRCC. Obviously, further
studies are needed to prove these hypotheses and fully
elaborate the mechanisms of tumor necrosis in CCRCC.

VEGF-A and Other Proangiogenic
Factors in CCRCC
Recently, angiogenic factors have gained increasing prognostic interests in a variety of solid tumors. The most
important of these factors is VEGF-A. The correlation
between the VEGF-A protein level and prognostic parameters in CCRCC patients has been confirmed in several
studies.15,46,53 Higher levels of VEGF-A protein in both
the tumor tissue and patient plasma have been shown to
Cancer

May 15, 2009

be correlated with the presence of tumor necrosis, higher
tumor grades, higher tumor cell proliferation rates, and
higher metastatic rates. However, VEGF-A mRNA levels
in CCRCC indicate a different correlation with tumor
aggressiveness and patient prognosis. In 1 study, a significantly higher VEGF-A mRNA level was found in a tumor
having a lower proliferation rate.46 In another study, a
higher VEGF-A mRNA level was found to be significantly
correlated with longer patient survival.54 Moreover, the
mRNA levels of some other proangiogenic genes are
also up-regulated in tumors with less aggressiveness and
are correlated with a better patient prognosis; these
include the genes for angiopoietin-2, VEGF receptor
(VEGFR)-1, and VEGFR-2.15,54
The striking discrepancy in the correlation to patient
prognosis between the VEGF-A protein level and VEGFA mRNA level could result from the tumor sample collection procedure, meaning that an artificially greater upregulation of the mRNA levels of proangiogenic factors
could take place in the lower grade tumor with better
prognosis. The explanatory assumption is as follows. We
have reported that low-grade CCRCCs have a higher density of differentiated vessels.34 Consistent with our finding, Yabuki et al reported that low-grade CCRCC tumors
demonstrate more enhancement on MRI, indicating
larger blood volume in the tumor.36 During nephrectomy
or other related surgeries, clamping and ligations of the
renal artery, renal vein, and some other draining vessels
always precede the isolation of the kidney and/or the
resection of the tumor. From the clamping of the blood
vessels to the removal of the kidney/tumor, which is
usually at least 20 minutes, a low-grade tumor will
undergo a reduction of blood supply greater than that of a
high-grade tumor. This sudden deprivation of blood supply could induce a more dramatic reduction in the oxygen
level inside the low-grade tumor, and consequently trigger
more transcription activity from proangiogenic genes
before the tumor samples were frozen and the proteins
were expressed. To test this idea, we mimicked surgical
conditions of human kidney tumor removal using an
orthotopic human CCRCC xenograft model. In preliminary experiments, we found that the duration between
blood supply depletion and freezing of the tumor tissue in
liquid nitrogen is critical to tumor VEGF mRNA levels.
As shown in Figure 1, prolongation of this time artificially
up-regulates VEGF mRNA levels, but VEGF protein
2285

Somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene inactivation has been shown in up to 70% of CCRCC cases.55
The VHL gene product (pVHL), together with other
component proteins, forms a complex that causes destruction of hypoxia-inducible factor-1a (HIF-1a) under normoxic conditions. Lack of VHL protein leads to
stabilization of HIF-1a, which activates a cascade of pathways, including the VEGF-A pathway. Theoretically, tumor cells with aberrant VHL genes might not produce
more VEGF in response to the sudden blood deprivation
during surgery. However, VEGF-A can also be produced
by macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and other
cell types,56-58 which are normally able to respond to
hypoxic conditions.

Future Targets for Antiangiogenic Therapy

FIGURE 1. Artificial up-regulation of vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF) mRNA in orthotopic xenograft clear
cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC). Orthotopic inoculation of
5  105 human CCRCC cells of the Caki-2 line into the subrenal capsule area of the left kidney was performed in 4 BALB/
c nude mice. On Day 110 after tumor cell inoculation, the mice
were anesthetized with continuous inhalation of isofluorane.
The left kidney was exposed through a midline abdominal
incision without bleeding. The calculation of the duration of
blood supply depletion was initiated at the moment of
removal of the kidney together with the xenograft tumor
from the animal. Each of the 4 xenograft tumors was randomly divided into 2 parts and frozen in liquid nitrogen at
4 different time points after blood supply depletion (at 1 minute, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, and 30 minutes, respectively).
The 2 parts of each tumor were then assayed for real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blot analysis
to evaluate the VEGF-A mRNA and protein levels. (A) The
VEGF-A mRNA level detected by real-time PCR increased
along with the prolongation of the duration between blood
depletion and freezing of the tissue. (B) The VEGF-A protein
level detected by Western blot analysis was not found to be
altered as the frozen time was prolonged.

levels remain the same. Although our results are highly
preliminary, they are illustrative of our model that prolonged depletion of blood supply resulting from the tumor sample collection procedure may artificially alter
VEGF mRNA levels.

The complexity of the tumor vasculature in CCRCC,
especially the characterization of the differentiated versus
undifferentiated microvessels, raises concerns about the
variation of therapeutic effects on tumor endothelial cells
compared with those in normal endothelial cells. Moreover, endothelial cells with pericyte coverage are usually
resistant to antiangiogenic drugs because of the presence
of the survival factors secreted by the pericytes.59,60 The
limitation of the therapeutic effects from current antiangiogenic drugs in CCRCC clinical trials further strengthens the notion that more realistic screening assays using
tumor-derived endothelial cells and even pericytes should
be developed and applied toward the identification of
more effective antiangiogenic agents. Recently, Maciag
et al reported that targeting the pericytes in tumor vasculature can inhibit the growth of tumors (including renal
carcinoma) in animal models.61 In fact, combined therapy
targeting both endothelial cells and pericytes has been
proposed for clinical trials.62
In conclusion, CCRCC is an important malignancy,
not only because of its frequently fatal progression, but
also due to its unique pathologic and biologic characteristics, from which we might be able to discern some critical
steps of tumor angiogenesis and metastasis. Differential
analysis of the CCRCC vasculature is necessary for drawing prognostic implications and for re-evaluating the therapeutic effects of antiangiogenic agents on each type of
tumor vessel. Many unanswered questions remain regarding the establishment and transformation of different

types of tumor vessels and the underlying molecular
mechanisms. A high VEGF protein level is reportedly correlated with tumor necrosis in CCRCC and poorer
patient survival; however, prudent interpretation of the
mRNA levels of VEGF and other proangiogenic factors is
needed. Novel screening methods for antiangiogenic
drugs involving tumor-derived endothelial cells should be
developed.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral
presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on
Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not correspond directly to the written article, which is a more general
review.
Dr. Michael Atkins: Thinking about this therapeutically, I would hypothesize that less organized blood vessels with less pericyte coverage might be more sensitive to
antiangiogenic therapies. Do you have any sense of how
this differs between patients with just primary tumors and
those who develop metastases?
Dr. Bin Tean Teh: There is a difference between
the lower grade and the metastatic group, but not much
difference between the higher grade and the metastatic
group.
Dr. Atkins: So, the metastatic group appears to
behave like the high-grade tumors.
Dr. Teh: Yes. Also, if you look at expression of
c-Met, it is definitely higher in the papillary type 1 than
the type 2.
Dr. William Kaelin: It would be interesting to
know whether VHL mutations are more prevalent in the
approximately 50% that you are calling good risk that
have up-regulated VEGF.
Dr. Teh: It appears that there are more mutations in
this group.
Dr. Kaelin: Treating endothelial cells in culture
with VEGF or blocked VEGF signaling would be a nice
place to use your gene expression profiling to try to get a
robust signature or find some biomarkers.
Dr. Teh: We are doing that.
Dr. Atkins: I have seen some data presented about
expression profiling where the biggest difference between
the sample sets is the institution that does the expression
profile rather than the actual changes within the tumor.
Cancer

May 15, 2009

To what extent are we now at a place where this expression
profiling is standard enough that the impact of institutional variation is minimized enabling this work to be
both reproducible and decentralized?
Dr. Teh: It depends on the purpose. For a diagnostic purpose, to distinguish between cell types, some of this
study may be too subtle within the same type, so we probably need better control. Among those 200 genes for
which we have prognostic value, we do not understand
the roles of a lot of them in RCC.
