Abstract
Salmonella typhimurium A1-R is auxotrophic for arg and leu, which attenuates
growth in normal tissue but allows high tumor targeting and virulence. A1-R is
effective against metastatic human prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer as well
as osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and glioma in clinically-relevant mouse models.
VNP20009 is also a genetically-modified strain of Salmonella typhimurium that has
been tested in Phase I clinical trials, but is more attenuated than S. typhimurium
A1-R and in addition of multiple amino-acid auxotrophs, is purine auxotropic with
the purI mutation. In the present study, mouse Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing nude
mouse models were treated with S. typhimurium A1-R or VNP20009. S. typhimurium
A1-R and VNP20009 were both eliminated from the liver and spleen approximately
3-5 days after administration via the tail vein. However, A1-R showed higher tumor
targeting and inhibited the Lewis lung carcinoma to a greater extent than VNP20009,
with less body weight loss. The mice tolerated S. typhimurium A1-R to at a least 2-fold
higher dose than VNP20009 when the bacteria were administered iv. The results of
the present study suggest that S. typhimurium A1-R has greater clinical potential
than VNP20009.

Introduction

tumors. These anaerobic bacteria cannot grow in viable
tumor tissue, which restricts their efficacy. In addition,
obligate anaerobic bacteria may be limited to intratumor
injection which would preclude their use for metastatic
cancer.
Recently a human patient with metastatic
leiomyosarcoma was treated by intratumoral injection of
Clostridium novyi (C. novyi)-NT spores which reduced the
tumor within and surrounding the bone [7]. However other
tumor deposits in the patient were not affected.
S. typhimurium is a facultative anaerobe and
therefore unlike anaerobe bacteria can infect viable
portions of tumors as well as necrotic areas. The
VNP20009 strain of S. typhimurium, attenuated with
purine and other auxotrophic mutations, has been
previously used for cancer therapy [8]. When NP20009
were inoculated i.p. into C57B6 mice bearing the B16F10
melanoma, it suppressed tumor growth and prolonged
average survival to as much as twice that of untreated

For more than 200 years, cancers have been
observed to regress following acute infections, mostly
streptococcal [1]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Coley infected cancer patients with Streptococcus
pyrogenes and later treated the patients with extracts of the
bacteria, which became known as Coley’s toxins. Coley
had remarkable results with both the bacteria and the
toxins [2]. However bacterial therapy of cancer stopped
after Coley’s death in 1936 [2].
Recently, there has been intense renewed interest
to develop bacterial therapy of cancer [2-4]. The barriers
in tumors for standard therapy such as hypoxia, acidic
pH, disorganized vascular architecture, are beneficial for
bacteria to target cancer [3].
One approach to bacterial therapy of cancer is
to use anaerobic bacteria such as Bifidobacterium [5]
and Clostridium [6] which replicate in necrotic areas of

Results and Discussion

mice [9].
VNP20009 is attenuated with a lipid A–mutation
(msbB), purine auxotrophy (purI) and amino acid
auxotrophs [8]. In a Phase I clinical trial on patients with
metastatic melanoma and renal-cell carcinoma, VNP20009
was safely administered, but poorly colonized the patients’
tumors, perhaps because it was overattenuated [10]. At
the highest tolerated dose, some tumor colonization was
observed [10].
Another strain of S. typhimurium, A1-R, has
been developed by our laboratory, which has greatly
increased antitumor efficacy. S. typhimurium A1-R is
auxotrophic only for leu-arg which prevents it from
mounting a continuous infection in normal tissues. S.
typhimurium A1-R has no other attenuating mutations
as does VNP20009. A1-R was able to eradicate primary
and metastatic tumors in monotherapy in nude mouse
models of prostate, breast, ovarian and pancreatic cancer,
as well as sarcoma and glioma [11-19]. S. typhimurium
A1-R also greatly inhibited bone and brain metastasis of
breast cancer in orthotopic mouse models [20, 21]. Tumors
with a high degree of vascularity were more sensitive to
S. typhimurium A1-R, and vascular destruction appears
to play a role in S. typhimurium A1-R antitumor efficacy
[22].
The present study compares S. typhimurium A1-R
and VNP20009 for anti-tumor efficacy in a nude mouse
model of highly aggressive lung cancer.

Comparison of toxicity of S. typhimurium A1-R
and VNP20009
There was lower toxicity of S. typhimurium A-1R
in nude mice compared to S. typhimurium VNP20009.
Treatment with S. typhimurium A1-R resulted in less
body weight loss than with VNP20009 (p = <0.05) (Fig.
1A). There was prolonged survival in mice treated with S.
typhimurium A1-R as compared to the non-tumor-bearing
mice treated with S. typhimurium VNP20009 (p = 0.005)
(Fig. 1B).
There were less hemorrhagic spots on the skin
and liver in mice treated with S. typhimurium A1-R
than VNP20009 (Figure 2). Bleeding foci were found
in the liver on day 3 after bacteria injection. However,
VNP20009 has more bleeding foci on the liver than in S.
typhimurium A1-R-treated mice (p <0.05).

Comparison of distribution of S. typhimurium
A1-R and VNP20009 in tumor, liver, spleen, and
blood
When the average tumor volume reached
approximately 70 mm3, S. typhimurium A1-R (1x107
CFU) or VNP-20009 (1x107 CFU) were injected into the

tail vein one time. Tissues were removed 6 days after
bacteria administration. Bacteria were isolated from the
tumor and organs and cultured in LB agar. Both strains
selectively targeted the tumor with greater targeting by S.
typhimurium A1-R than VNP20009. VNP20009 had more
bacteria in the liver and spleen and blood (p <0.05) (Figure
3).

(p<0.05). Control mice had a tumor weight of (2.53 g ±
0.42) which was greater compared to VNP20009-treated
mice (p <0.05) or S. typhimurium A1-R-treated mice
(p<0.01) (Figure 4B).

Conclusions
S. typhimurium A1-R had lower toxicity in
nude mice compared to S. typhimurium VNP20009. S.
typhimurium A1-R and S. typhimurium VNP20009 both
inhibited growth of the Lewis lung cancer in nude mouse
subcutaneous models. However, S. typhimurium A1-R was
more efficacious than S. typhimurium VNP20009 on tumor
growth inhibition.
The results of the present study indicate S.
typhimurium A1-R should enter clinical trials as soon as
possible. Better results with S. typhimurium A1-R than
VNP20009 should be expected since S. typhimurium A1-R
is more virulent against the tumor and less toxic against
the host. Better results with S. typhimurium A1-R than
C. novyi-NT should be expected since S. typhimurium
A1-R can be effectively administered systemically and
C. novyi-NT seems limited to intratumor administration,
possibly precluding it from targeting metastatic disease. A
promising application of S. typhimurium A1-R is to decoy
cancer cells within tumor to divide and thereby become
sensitive to chemotherapy [23].
The bacterial tumor targeting described in the
present report can take advantage of previously developed
tumor targeting strategies [24-31].

Comparison of efficacy of S. typhimurium A1-R
and VNP20009
S. typhimurium A1-R reduced tumor growth to a
greater extent than VNP20009 (p < 0.05) (Figure 4A).
On day 10, a significantly lower tumor burden in mice
treated with S. typhimurium A1-R than mice treated with
VNP20009 was observed. S. typhimurium A1-R-treated
mice had a tumor weight (0.594 g ± 0.23) which was
lower than with VNP20009-treated mice (1.378 g ± 0.51)

Materials and Methods
Cells
Lewis lung carcinoma cells were maintained in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,
2 mM glutamine (Gibco-BRL, Life Technologies, Inc.,
Carlsbad, CA). The cell line was cultured at 37°C in a 5%
incubator. RFP vector production and transduction of the
Lewis lung cancer cell line were performed as previously
published [32-34]. The RFP (DsRed-2) gene (Clontech
Laboratories, Palo Alto, CA) was inserted in the retroviralbased mammalian expression vector pLNCX (Clontech)
to form the pLNCX-DsRed-2 vector as previously
described [32-34]. For RFP gene transduction, 70%
confluent Lewis lung carcinoma cells were incubated with
a 1:1 precipitated mixture of pLNCX DsRed-2-retroviralcontaining supernatants of PT67 packaging cells and
RPMI 1640 or other culture medium (Life Technologies)
containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals,
Norcross, GA) for 72 h and selected using G418 [35].

Mice

Efficacy experiments

Nude mice were from AntiCancer Inc. (San
Diego, CA). All mouse studies were conducted with an
AntiCancer Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
(IACUC)-protocol specifically approved for this study
and in accordance with the principals and procedures
outlined in the National Institute of Health Guide for
the Care and Use of Animals under Assurance Number
A3873-1. The animals were observed on a daily basis and
humanely sacrificed by CO2 inhalation when they met
the following humane endpoint criteria: prostration, skin
lesions, significant body weight loss, difficulty breathing,
epistaxis, rotational motion and body temperature drop.
Animals were housed in a barrier facility on a high
efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered rack under
standard conditions of 12-hour light/ dark cycles. Animals
were housed with no more than 5 per cage. The animals
were fed an autoclaved laboratory rodent diet.

Group 1 mice served as untreated controls. Ten mice
in group 2 were treated with S. typhimurium A1-R (1 ×
107cfu/100 µl i.v.), once a week for 2 weeks. Ten mice in
group 3 were treated iv with VNP20009 (1 × 107cfu/100
µl i.v.), once a week for 2 weeks. On the 3rd day after
treatment, five mice in each group were sacrificed.
Bacteria were isolated from tumors, the liver, spleen and
blood and cultured in LB agar. For the remaining five mice
in each group, the tumors were removed by surgery to
compare with the control group on day 10 after treatment.
Tumor weight was determined on day 10.

Imaging
Bacteria from the organs were imaged with the
Maestro fluorescence imaging system (Perkin-Elmer Inc.).
The Maestro multispectral imaging systems contains a
liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) optically coupled to
a CCD camera. Multispectral images are acquired with
images typically spaced every 10 nm throughout the
desired spectral rang [36-38].

Mouse model of aggressive lung cancer
Mouse tumor models were made by subcutaneously
injecting Lewis lung carcinoma cells expressing RFP
(LLC-RFP) cells (3 × 106 cells/100 µl PBS) in the flank of
nude mice [32].

Twenty nude mice, 6 weeks old, were used to
compare toxicity of S. typhimurium A1-R and VNP20009.
The nude mice were randomized into 4 groups of 5 mice.
Group 1 mice were treated with S. typhimurium A1-R
(2.5 × 107cfu/100 µl i.v.), once a week for 5 weeks.
Group 2 mice were treated with S. typhimurium A1-R (5
× 107cfu/100 µl i.v.), once a week for 5 weeks. Group 3
mice were treated with S. typhimurium VNP20009 (2.5
× 107cfu/100 µL i.v.), once a week for 5 weeks. Group
4 mice were treated VNP20009 (5 × 107cfu/100 µL i.v.),
once a week for 5 weeks. All mice were used for survival
determination for 35 days post initial treatment.
