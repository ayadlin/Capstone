Malignancy in Children and
Adolescents

Secondary acute leukemia is a devastating complication in children and adolescents who have been treated
for cancer. Secondary acute lymphoblastic leukemia (s-ALL) was rarely reported previously but can be distinguished today from recurrent primary ALL by comparison of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangement. Secondary acute myeloid leukemia (s-AML) is much more common, and some cases actually
may be second primary cancers. Treatment-related and host-related characteristics and their interactions
have been identified as risk factors for s-AML. The most widely recognized treatment-related risk factors
are alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors (epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines). The magnitude of the risk associated with these factors depends on several variables, including the administration
schedule, concomitant medications, and host factors. A high cumulative dose of alkylating agents is well
known to predispose to s-AML. The prevalence of alkylator-associated s-AML has diminished among pediatric oncology patients with the reduction of cumulative alkylator dose and limited use of the more leukemogenic alkylators. The best-documented topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated s-AML is s-AML associated
with epipodophyllotoxins. The risk of s-AML in these cases is influenced by the schedule of drug administration and by interaction with other antineoplastic agents but is not consistently found to be related to cumulative dose. The unpredictable risk of s-AML after epipodophyllotoxin therapy may discourage the use of
these agents, even in patients at a high risk of disease recurrence, although the benefit of recurrence prevention may outweigh the risk of s-AML. Studies in survivors of adult cancers suggest that, contrary to previous beliefs, the outcome of s-AML is not necessarily worse than that of de novo AML when adjusted for
cytogenetic features. More studies are needed to confirm this finding in the pediatric patient population.

Review Article

The sequelae of cancer treatment are of increasing concern as contemporary therapy increases the survival of
patients with pediatric malignancies. The development of
a second cancer is among the most devastating and potentially life-threatening sequelae of childhood cancer. A second cancer may be of any histologic subtype, from
benign, low-grade tumors to high-grade malignancies,
such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML)/myelodysplastic
syndrome (MDS) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(ALL). There is compelling evidence that specific therapies are etiologic agents of secondary leukemogenesis.1-4
In some cases, host factors also may contribute.5,6 Here,
we review current knowledge regarding the incidence of
second hematologic malignancies and risk factors for their
development in children and adolescents who were treated
previously for cancer. When information was not available from pediatric studies, we included data derived from
adult cancer patients. In addition, we provide a novel
mortality-based analysis of the risk-benefit ratio of epipodophyllotoxin administration in patients with ALL by
comparing the risk of death from ALL recurrence to the
risk of death from secondary AML (s-AML).

AML AS A SECONDARY
MALIGNANCY
‘Secondary’ AML or ‘second de novo’ AML?
The terms ‘secondary AML’ and ‘treatment-related AML’
often are used interchangeably to describe AML for which
previous cytotoxic therapy is considered to have contributed to its etiology. This designation includes cases of
MDS and chronic myeloproliferative disorder.7 However,
some investigators have reported cases of AML occurring
as a second cancer that cannot be attributed to previous
cancer chemotherapy or radiation. Examples include
AML as a second cancer in patients whose sole therapy
was surgical resection of the primary cancer.8,9 It is now
hypothesized that these cases are ‘second de novo’ cancers,
because leukemogenesis is likely to reflect a genetic predisposition to multiple primary cancers, as opposed to genotoxicity caused by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. This
hypothesis is supported by the high incidence of AML
and other cancers in patients with specific genetic disorders such as Down syndrome10 and Fanconi anemia.11
The incidence of cancer also is significantly higher in first24

degree relatives of patients with s-AML than in those of
patients with de novo AML.8
Although the prognosis of s-AML often is considered to be less favorable than that of de novo AML, a similarly favorable prognosis is reported for de novo and
secondary acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).9,12 However, because a significant proportion of ‘secondary’ APL
seems to be unrelated to prior therapies8,9 and because of
the clinical similarity of de novo APL and APL that develop after other tumors, some cases of ‘secondary’ APL
are considered second primary malignancies.12

Risk Factors
Chemotherapeutic Agents

The combinations of cytotoxic and biologic agents
and modalities used to treat pediatric cancer hinder elucidation of the factors that contribute to s-AML (Table 1).
Moreover, unknown host factors may confound the calculated risk estimates and compromise their predictive accuracy. Nevertheless, compelling data indicate that
treatment with alkylating agents and topoisomerase II
inhibitors (epipodophyllotoxins and anthracyclines)
increases the probability of s-AML.

(Table 2). This type of s-AML tends to occur late (typically 5-7 years after therapy); the timing between the onset
of MDS and s-AML varies and may be explained by the
requirement for subsequent genetic events after the loss of
material from chromosome 5 or 7.4 The French-American-British (FAB) type is most commonly M1 or M2, in
contrast to the myelomonocytic subtypes of epipodophyllotoxin-induced s-AML (Table 2).
During the early 1970s, several groups reported an
excess risk of s-AML in adults and children with Hodgkin
lymphoma who received combined mechlorethamine,
vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone (MOPP) chemotherapy or similar alkylating agent regimens.13-15 The
Late Effects Study Group observed that survivors of
Hodgkin lymphoma who had been treated with alkylating
agents at age 16 years had a relative risk of leukemia that
was nearly 80 times that of population controls (standardized incidence ratio [SIR] of 78.8; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 56.6-123.2). The relative risk of s-AML in
this group was 321.3 (95% CI, 207.5-467.1).16 German
and Austrian investigators subsequently observed a
decline in the SIR to 122 (95% CI, 36-254) after the
introduction of protocols with lower cumulative doses of
alkylating agents that substituted cyclophosphamide for
the more leukemogenic mechlorethamine.17 The use of
combined doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and
dacarbazine instead of MOPP also significantly reduced
the risk of s-AML.18
Unlike s-AML associated with topoisomerase II
inhibitors, alkylating agent-related s-AML4,19 appears to
Cancer

be dependent on the dose, but not the schedule, of administration.4 Moreover, some alkylating agents are more leukemogenic than others.17 For example, mechlorethamine
is more leukemogenic than cyclophosphamide.17 Host
factors also appear to play a crucial role in the development of alkylating agent-induced s-AML.4 For example, a
high incidence of second malignancies, including s-AML,
has been reported in individuals with neurofibromatosis 1
who develop a first cancer. The increased susceptibility to
s-AML in patients with neurofibromatosis 1 who were
treated previously with alkylating agents was verified in
Nf1 knockout mice.20 Patients with other genetic syndromes, such as Fanconi anemia, also exhibit susceptibility to alkylating agent-induced s-AML and MDS,4 as do
individuals with genetic polymorphisms that affect glutathione transferase theta 1 activity.21
Epipodophyllotoxins

Epipodophyllotoxin-induced s-AML was described
first in the late 1980s22-24 and, since then, has been the
characteristic model of s-AML. This type of s-AML is usually of the FAB M4 or M5 subtype, although other subtypes have been reported (Table 2).23 Unlike alkylating
agent-related s-AML, which occurs relatively late and often has a preleukemic phase, epipodophyllotoxin-related
s-AML commonly presents as overt AML after a brief
(usually 2-3 year) latency period (Table 2). The risk varies
as a function of the schedule, the cumulative total dose,
concomitant administration of other chemotherapeutic or
supportive drug regimens, and the genetic makeup of the

documented.

Cumulative dose and schedule of epipodophyllotoxins. Data concerning the impact of cumulative epipodophyllotoxin dose on the risk of s-AML are
contradictory. Some groups24,25 have observed a significant excess risk of s-AML in patients who were treated
with higher cumulative etoposide doses, although no specific threshold has been shown to be necessary for induction of leukemogenesis. Ratain et al25 observed that a
median cumulative etoposide dose of 6795 mg/m2 was
more leukemogenic than a 3025 mg/m2 dose in adults
with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer. Le Deley et al24
reported a 7-fold (95% CI, 2.6-19-fold) greater risk of sAML in children who were treated for solid tumors who
received between 1200 and 6000 mg/m2 of epipodophyllotoxins or >170 mg/m2 of anthracyclines than in those
who received lower doses or none of these drugs. However, these dose relations have not been confirmed by
other investigators.2,26
The findings of several studies suggest that the
schedule of administration of epipodophyllotoxins is
more important than the cumulative dose.1,2 St. Jude
investigators compared frequent, intermittent (once or
twice weekly) administration of etoposide with other
schedules (during induction therapy only or every other
week) in children with ALL. The frequent, intermittent
26

schedule was associated with a greater risk of s-AML (6year cumulative incidence [standard error], 8.3% [3%]
for the weekly schedule and 7.1% [2.8%] for the twiceweekly schedule) than the other schedules (0%-2%
[1.2%] for induction only or every other week; P ¼
.02).1,2 A review by Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program
investigators also determined that the likelihood of sAML after treatment with epipodophyllotoxins is not
dose-dependent. The 6-year cumulative incidence of sAML in groups that received low (<1.5 g/m2), moderate
(1.5-2.99 g/m2), and higher (3 g/m2) cumulative doses
of etoposide was 3.3%, (95% upper confidence limit,
5.9%), 0.7% (1.6%), and 2.2% (4.6%), respectively. The
authors also noted that patients with solid tumors had a
lower frequency of s-AML than those with leukemia,
which they attributed to the different dosing schedules of
epipodophyllotoxins.26 In regimens for solid tumors, etoposide commonly is administered for 5 consecutive days,
whereas intermittent dosing schedules are used in treating
leukemia. These investigators speculated that mutant cells
that had undergone leukemogenic recombination did not
survive the more protracted schedule.26 It is also plausible
that the hematopoietic cells of patients with leukemia are
more vulnerable to genotoxic events that predispose to sAML. Indeed, patients who are treated for certain solid
tumors (eg, retinoblastoma) appear to be less susceptible
to s-AML than patients with other tumors despite the

use of epipodophyllotoxins.24,27 Regimens for recurrent
tumors and for palliative care often call for continuous
administration of low-dose etoposide.28,29 Although the
limited survival of this patient population obscures the
true incidence of s-AML, this approach appears to confer a low risk of s-AML.29 Consistent with this observation are the results of in vitro studies demonstrating a
greater ratio of cytotoxicity to genetic recombination after prolonged exposure to etoposide than after brief
exposure.30
Concomitant chemotherapy agents. The results of
a few studies published to date suggest that asparaginase
administration enhances the risk of epipodophyllotoxininduced s-AML.31,32 The precise mechanism is not
known, but Relling speculated that the lower protein levels generated by asparaginase decrease the synthesis of
some proteins involved in protection from etoposideinduced recombinogenesis.33 If this premise is correct,
then the high incidence of s-AML in the Pediatric Oncology Group (POG) 8704 study may be explained by
chronic exposure to high-dose asparaginase (25,000 IU/
m2) administered weekly for 20 weeks.32 Likewise, St.
Jude investigators postulated that asparaginase exposure
immediately before epipodophyllotoxin administration
accounted for the increased incidence of s-AML.31 In that
study, asparaginase was given every 4 weeks, which probably resulted in consistent suppression of the plasma protein level. The combination of epipodophyllotoxins and
alkylating agents (eg, cisplatin)25,34-36 or antimetabolites
(eg, mercaptopurine or methotrexate)2,22 also has been
associated with an increased incidence of s-AML.
Anthracyclines and Mitoxantrone

The administration of topoisomerase II inhibitors
other than epipodophyllotoxins also is associated with an
increased risk of s-AML; these agents include anthracyclines and anthracenediones (mitoxantrone). Their impact tends to be underrated because of the substantial risk
associated with epipodophyllotoxins, but their potential
leukemogenic activity should be considered. In fact, it
appears that only 5 of the 24 patients who were treated on
the Children’s Cancer Group (CCG) 2891 study who
later had s-AML37 received epipodophyllotoxins. Most of
those patients had received anthracyclines and/or cyclophosphamide. A St. Jude series identified 4 patients with
s-AML that involving 11q23 and 21q23 abnormalities34
Cancer

among those whose prior therapy included doxorubicin,
cyclophosphamide, and radiation therapy but not
epipodophyllotoxins.
The clinical and cytogenetic features of anthracycline-related s-AML resemble those of epipodophyllotoxin-related s-AML (Table 2), but other chromosomal
abnormalities have been reported. A large study of adults
with APL treated with all-trans retinoic acid and anthracycline monochemotherapy identified cytogenetic abnormalities involving chromosomes 5 and 7 that are
characteristic of alkylating agent-associated s-AML.38 The
role of the dosing schedule or cumulative dose of anthracyclines in the development of s-AML has not been
established.19,34
Several studies of adults with cancer have demonstrated an excess risk of s-AML related to anthracenedione
therapy. In a large case-control study of patients with
breast cancer, those who received an anthracenedionebased regimen that featured mitoxantrone had a much
higher risk of s-AML than those who received an anthracycline-based regimen.39 This finding has been confirmed
by other groups.40-42 Adults who developed s-AML after
receiving mitoxantrone-based chemotherapy for acute
leukemia had cytogenetic abnormalities most frequently
involving chromosomes 7q, 20q, 1q, and 13q, but not the
11q23 abnormalities typically associated with topoisomerase-II inhibitors.43
Nonchemotherapeutic Agents

Several nonchemotherapeutic agents also may contribute to the development of s-AML, either independently or through interaction with cytotoxic antineoplastic
agents. POG studies 9426 and 9425 evaluated the impact
of the cardioprotectant dexrazoxane on the outcomes of
children with Hodgkin lymphoma who received standard
chemotherapy (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and
etoposide with or without prednisone and cyclophosphamide) and low-dose radiation. Participants were assigned
randomly to receive either dexrazoxane or no cardioprotectant before anthracycline.44 Six of 8 patients who
developed s-AML and 2 patients who developed secondary solid tumors were in the dexrazoxane arm. The 4-year
cumulative incidence of s-AML was 2.55%  1% with
dexrazoxane and 0.85%  0.6% in the nondexrazoxane
group (P ¼ .160). The SIR for s-AML was 613.6 (95%
CI, 225.2-1335.6) among patients who received
27

Review Article

dexrazoxane (n ¼ 239) and 202.4 (95% CI, 24.5-731.0)
among those who did not receive dexrazoxane (n ¼ 239;
P ¼ .099). The investigators speculated that dexrazoxane,
which is a topoisomerase II inhibitor with a mechanism
distinct from that of either epipodophyllotoxins or
anthracyclines, may have had a synergistic adverse effect
on DNA repair when combined with etoposide. It is noteworthy that most patients with s-AML in that study did
not exhibit the typical 11q23 translocation but had other
cytogenetic abnormalities (including monosomy 7 and
trisomy 8) usually associated with alkylating agentinduced s-AML. Similar results were not reported in a
study of high-risk ALL in children at Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute. With a median follow-up of 6.2 years, only
1 patient developed a second cancer (melanoma), and that
patient did not receive dexrazoxane; the incidence of second malignancy did not differ statistically between the
groups that did (n ¼ 105) and did not (n ¼ 100) receive
dexrazoxane (P ¼ .66).45
Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)
also may increase the incidence of s-AML, although
reports have not been consistent. Relling et al observed an
increased risk of s-AML in pediatric patients with ALL
who received G-CSF plus a regimen that included alkylating agents, anthracyclines, and epipodophyllotoxins.46
Conversely, Bhatia et al reported no association between
G-CSF administration and s-AML in a group of children
with Ewing sarcoma who received doxorubicin, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and dactinomycin (Regimen A)
or those 4 drugs alternating with etoposide and ifosfamide
(Regimen B).19 In adults, a few studies associated G-CSF
with an increased risk of s-AML in patients who had
breast cancer,39,47 but that finding was not replicated in a
study of patients who were older (median age, 75.6 years;
range, 66-104 years) at the time of breast cancer diagnosis.48 Therefore, it is not clear whether G-CSF treatment
induces s-AML, and it is not clear whether G-CSF enhances leukemogenesis associated with alkylating agents or topoisomerase II inhibitors.49
Immunosuppression associated with solid organ
transplantation is a well known risk factor for lymphoma,
but myeloid leukemia has been reported only rarely in
transplantation recipients. Offman et al examined data
from 170,000 recipients of solid organ transplantation at
>300 centers participating in the Collaborative Transplant Study.50 The relative risk of s-AML in transplanta28

tion recipients versus age-matched, sex-matched, and
geographically matched controls was 5.5 (95% CI, 4.07.7; P < .0001) for heart/lung recipients and 2.1 (95%
CI, 1.6-2.7; P < .0001) for kidney recipients. In that
study, the incidence of s-AML was significantly higher in
patients who received 2 to 3 mg/kg per day of azathioprine than in patients who received <1 mg/kg per day (P
¼ .031).
Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation

Various second malignancies have been reported in
recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
Oncogenesis in these patients probably is multifactorial.51,52 Several studies have observed a higher incidence
of s-AML in patients with lymphoma who underwent autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation than in those
who received conventional chemotherapy.53-55 Pretransplantation therapy is likely an important contributor to
leukemogenesis; preparative conditioning chemotherapy
and total body irradiation for autologous transplantation
also are contributors along with polymorphisms that govern drug metabolism and DNA repair during the extensive cellular proliferation associated with engraftment.52
S-AML in transplantation survivors usually exhibits features of alkylating agent-associated disease,55 although it
is not clear whether alkylating agents or other factors play
a causative role.54
Host Factors

Certain host factors contribute to susceptibility to sAML. Several studies have demonstrated that specific
polymorphisms of detoxification enzymes play an important role in secondary oncogenesis. Polymorphisms that
reduce the enzymatic activity of thiopurine methyltransferase,56 a variant of CYP3A that affects production of a
DNA-damaging metabolite of epipodophyllotoxin,57 and
polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase P158 and
NAD(P)H:quinine oxireductase (NQO1)59 also are associated with increased risk of s-AML after chemotherapy.
Increased susceptibility to s-AML also has been linked to
polymorphisms of DNA repair genes.60,61 Emerging genome-wide approaches, such as gene expression profiling62 and single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays,63 are
being used to understand the pathogenesis of s-AML and
identify patients at risk. Further studies are needed to confirm the predictive value of these methods.

Acute Leukemia After Childhood Cancer / Hijiya et al

A higher incidence of s-AML has been observed in
association with certain primary malignancies. For example, breast cancer often precedes acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL).64 Le Deley et al also reported a high
incidence of s-AML after pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma
or osteosarcoma.24 However, various confounding factors
may affect the interpretation of those findings. For
instance, Smith et al hypothesized that the incidence of sAML was lower in pediatric patients with solid tumors
than in those with ALL because of the different dosing
schedule of epipodophyllotoxins.26 Nonocular secondary
solid tumors are common in patients with retinoblastoma,
but s-AML is rare in this population despite the common
use of alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors.27
This may be because the genotype that results in the retinoblastoma phenotype does not include hematopoietic
stem cell abnormalities.65

Treatment and Outcome of Secondary AML
The prognosis of s-AML is generally considered to be
poorer than that of de novo AML.66 The disease tends to
be refractory to chemotherapy, and patients’ tolerance of
treatment generally is reduced because of prior therapies.
For these reasons, clinicians have been reluctant to use curative (ie, highly intensive) therapies. Furthermore, the
survival rates of patients with s-AML are difficult to predict, because they often are affected by recurrence of the
primary cancer. The outcome of treatment has been
reported only for small series of pediatric patients with sAML.67-69 Twenty-four patients with s-AML who were
treated on the CCG 2891 study had lower rates of remission induction, survival, and event-free survival than
patients with de novo AML.37 In that study, outcomes
were better among patients (including patients with sAML) who were assigned randomly to receive intensively
timed induction therapy than among those who received
standard-timed induction.
For a part of the current review, we used data from
the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)
cancer registry to compare the outcomes of children with
newly diagnosed ALL, AML, and s-AML.70,71 Figure 1
shows the 2003 period estimate of 5-year survival by diagnostic category among children aged <20 years at diagnosis. Children with s-AML had a 5-year survival rate
(23.7%) that was significantly lower than the rate among

only the most recent interval survival estimate of cases diagnosed in different calendar years (cross-sectional estimate of
survival). Five years of data from the SEER17 registries71 were
used per survival cohort. SEER*Stat allows the calculation of
period survival for only the latest possible year in the database. We calculated 5-year period survival by using 5-year
cohorts for 2003. The first interval (1 year) used cases diagnosed during 1999 thorough 2003, the second interval
(2 years) used cases diagnosed during 1998 through 2002,
and so forth, until there were 5 years of survival. Therefore,
this analysis included cases diagnosed between 1995 and
2003. ALL indicates acute lymphoblastic leukemia; AML,

children with AML as a first primary cancer (53.2%; 2sample z-test comparing proportions ¼ 4.34; P < .001;
Stata version 10.1).
Investigators in the German Cooperative Groups
trials speculated that the comparatively low survival rate
of s-AML patients (median age, 57 years; range, 1682 years) resulted from the predominance of s-AML
with unfavorable karyotypes. The presence of s-AML
did not result in poor survival with standard intensive
chemotherapy.66,72 This finding also was supported by
the Italian Group for Adult Hematologic Diseases
(GIMEMA), in which poor survival was correlated with
older age, lower performance status, and high comorbidity after onset of s-AML during adulthood.73 More
recently, investigators at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer
Research Center reported that, after hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation, the outcome of pediatric and adult
patients with s-AML was comparable to the outcome of
patients with de novo AML after adjustment for risk factors.74 However, that study included patients with nonneoplastic primary diseases.74
29

Review Article

Larson proposed a management algorithm for adult
s-AML that uses performance status (age, comorbidities,
primary disease status, and complications of primary therapy) and karyotype.75 According to the algorithm,
patients with s-AML who have a good performance status
should be treated in a manner similar to the treatment for
patients with de novo AML who have the same cytogenetic abnormalities (ie, chemotherapy alone for favorable
cytogenetic features), such as t(15;17), inv(16), and
t(8;21); intensive chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem
cell transplantation for other karyotypes; and more investigational therapy for unfavorable karyotypes. Supportive
care alone may be warranted for those with poor performance status. Further studies are needed to determine
whether this approach is applicable to pediatric patients.

When Is the Use of Epipodophyllotoxins
Justified?
Epipodophyllotoxins still are used commonly to treat various solid tumors, Hodgkin lymphoma, and de novo
AML in children. However, they have been eliminated
from most frontline therapies for ALL.76 Although clinicians are reluctant to use epipodophyllotoxins, nearly all
standard ALL regimens include anthracyclines and cyclophosphamide, which also are common causes of s-AML.
Moreover, the contribution of epipodophyllotoxins to the
overall success of frontline ALL therapies has not been
established. Large clinical trials77,78 have demonstrated
that the majority of cases of pediatric ALL can be cured
with regimens that do not include epipodophyllotoxins. A
few frontline regimens for very high-risk ALL78 have
included epipodophyllotoxins but did not establish their
efficacy. It is possible that specific groups of patients with
high-risk disease features could benefit from these agents.
In a preliminary exploration of this possibility, we used
existing data to compare the relative risk of recurrence of
ALL with that of s-AML in children with ALL.
Figure 2 summarizes and estimates the proportions
of potential outcomes of children within 5 years after diagnosis of ALL. Estimated proportions are either means
calculated from reports of contemporary trials79-89 or
were derived from SEER data (survival after secondary
AML).90 These estimates indicate that the proportion of
children who had a first remission but died because of disease recurrence was approximately 0.13 (0.24*0.54). The
30

proportion of children who had a first remission but died
because of s-AML was estimated at 0.01 (0.016*0.763).
The 12% (95% CI, 5.1%-18.9%) difference between
these 2 proportions is substantial and significant (P ¼
.001).
Because many other host-related and treatmentrelated factors may influence survival, we cannot identify
the specific contributions of epipodophyllotoxins to the
total risk of death from s-AML. However, although we
acknowledge the confounding survival factors and differences between risk groups in published trials, we can use
recurrence-related and s-AML-related death rates to estimate the minimum event-free survival rate at which the
risk of death from s-AML is less than the risk of death
from recurrence. At this point, clinicians considering the
risks and benefits of treatment for an individual patient
may wish to explore the role of epipodophyllotoxins
administered on an appropriate dose schedule to reduce
the risk of recurrence. By using the highest reported incidence of epipodophyllotoxin-related s-AML (0.083)1 and
the survival estimates from Figure 2, we estimate that the
risk of death from s-AML exceeds the risk of death from
recurrence in a child with newly diagnosed ALL when the
probability of recurrence is 0.117.
This result indicates, in theory, that the risk of death
from recurrence of ALL exceeds the risk of death from sAML when the survival rate of ALL is <88.3%. In reality,
any pediatric oncologist would hesitate to use epipodophyllotoxins in a patient with an excellent (>80%) chance

of survival. Moreover, most clinicians view s-AML as a
treatment complication that should be avoided at all costs.
Nonetheless, it appears that there is a subset of patients for
whom treatment with epipodophyllotoxins may provide a
benefit in optimizing disease control. Moreover, factors
such as the administration schedule, combination with
other agents, and host characteristics can modify the risk
of s-AML.

ALL AS A SECONDARY
MALIGNANCY
Although clinicians are well aware of s-AML, ALL after
primary cancer is considered very rare and usually receives
little attention.91-93 It is not known whether those cases
are secondary to the primary cancer or represent a second
primary cancer. Herein, we have termed cases of ALL after
cancer ‘secondary ALL’ (s-ALL). Only 5% to 10% of all
secondary acute leukemias are ALL.93 S-ALL has been
reported after primary ALL1,91 as well as after various
other cancers.92,93
Because cases of s-ALL after primary ALL are rare,
the majority of cases have most likely been misdiagnosed
as recurrent ALL. In 14 consecutive ALL studies at St.
Jude over a 30-year period, only 2 of 2304 patients with
primary ALL had a diagnosis of s-ALL.1 In recent years,
molecular detection of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor rearrangements has facilitated the identification of sALL. By using these methods, Zuna et al91 estimated that
between 0.5% to 1.5% of 366 cases of ‘recurrent’ ALL
actually were s-ALL. The malignant clones in all of those
cases differed from those that were present at the time of
diagnosis. The duration of first complete remission
ranged from 1.7 years to 6.5 years. The authors proposed
diagnostic criteria for s-ALL while acknowledging the
obstacles to its definitive diagnosis (Table 4). Another
recent study94 identified a completely different T-cell receptor gene rearrangement at diagnosis and late ‘recurrence’ of T-ALL in 5 of 16 patients, suggesting the
diagnosis of secondary T-cell ALL rather than recurrence.
Furthermore, all patients remained in complete remission
after retrieval therapy, which is an unusually good outcome for patients with recurrent T-ALL. Our knowledge
will increase as more cases of s-ALL are identified using
modern technologies.

Conclusions
Numerous studies have confirmed that treatment with
topoisomerase II inhibitors (epipodophyllotoxins and
anthracyclines) and alkylating agents increases the probability of s-AML. The risk of s-AML is influenced by treatment factors, including the schedule of administration
and concomitant medications. The role of host factors,
such as polymorphisms of detoxification enzymes and primary tumors, also should be considered. The risks and
benefits of using epipodophyllotoxins in frontline pediatric cancer treatment regimens often are unclear. The benefit of epipodophyllotoxins may outweigh the risk of sAML in some cases of high-risk childhood ALL, although
more studies are needed to confirm this possibility. In
addition, the probability of s-AML may be reduced by
controlling or considering other risk factors, such as concomitantly administered drugs, administration schedule,
and host characteristics. Recent studies have demonstrated
that the outcome of adults with s-AML does not differ
from that of those with de novo AML when data are
adjusted for unfavorable cytogenetic findings; therefore,
the recommended treatment for adult patients with sAML is the same as that used for de novo AML in the
same cytogenetic risk group. More studies are needed to
determine whether the same approach can be applied to
pediatric patients. S-ALL has been reported very rarely,
but more cases may be identified through modern
technologies.
