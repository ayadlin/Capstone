Role of the Human High-Afﬁnity Copper Transporter in
Copper Homeostasis Regulation and Cisplatin Sensitivity in
Cancer Chemotherapy
Macus Tien Kuo1, Siqing Fu2, Niramol Savaraj3, and Helen H.W. Chen4,5

Abstract
The high-afﬁnity copper transporter (Ctr1; SCLC31A1) plays an important role in regulating copper homeostasis because copper is an essential micronutrient and copper deﬁciency is detrimental to many important
cellular functions, but excess copper is toxic. Recent research has revealed that human copper homeostasis is
tightly controlled by interregulatory circuitry involving copper, Sp1, and human (hCtr1). This circuitry uses Sp1
transcription factor as a copper sensor in modulating hCtr1 expression, which in turn controls cellular copper and
Sp1 levels in a 3-way mutual regulatory loop. Posttranslational regulation of hCtr1 expression by copper stresses
has also been described in the literature. Because hCtr1 can also transport platinum drugs, this ﬁnding
underscores the important role of hCtr1 in platinum-drug sensitivity in cancer chemotherapy. Consistent with
this notion is the ﬁnding that elevated hCtr1 expression was associated with favorable treatment outcomes in
cisplatin-based cancer chemotherapy. Moreover, cultured cell studies showed that elevated hCtr1 expression can
be induced by depleting cellular copper levels, resulting in enhanced cisplatin uptake and its cell-killing activity. A
phase I clinical trial using a combination of trientine (a copper chelator) and carboplatin has been carried out with
encouraging results. This review discusses new insights into the role of hCtr1 in regulating copper homeostasis
and explains how modulating cellular copper availability could inﬂuence treatment efﬁcacy in platinum-based
cancer chemotherapy through hCtr1 regulation. Cancer Res; 72(18); 4616–21. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
Platinum–based antitumor agents, including cisplatin
(cDDP), carboplatin (CBDCA), and oxaliplatin (L-OHP), have
been used for treating human solid tumors for more than 3
decades, especially testicular and ovarian cancers, for which
high response rates are attainable. Drug resistance is an
important obstacle to achieving maximal therapeutic efﬁcacy
of these drugs. Overcoming drug resistance is very important
for improving treatment outcomes, because once drug resistance has developed, other effective treatment options are
limited. No effective strategy for combating cDDP resistance
in cancer chemotherapy is currently available.
Mechanisms of cDDP resistance are complex. Here, we
focus on a drug transport–associated resistance. This resistance mechanism has gained substantial attention after the
discovery that high-afﬁnity copper transporter (Ctr1; hCtr1

for humans) is the major transporter for cDDP (1). In this
review, we discuss some inconsistencies published in the
literature about mechanisms of hCtr1 regulation in copper
homeostasis maintenance that are relevant to platinumdrug sensitivity.
It has been well established that the primary target of
antitumor platinum drugs is DNA, by the formation of intraand interstranded DNA-drug adducts. Many previous reports
have shown that cDDP cytotoxicity is correlated with the
amount of DNA adducts, which is proportional to the total
platinum content inside the cells. These ﬁndings underscore
the importance of the transport system in platinum-drug
cancer chemotherapy. These studies indicated that cDDP
enters cells by means of passive diffusion, driven by concentration gradients or by the endocytotic pathway (see reviews in
refs. 2, 3). The discovery of hCtr1 as a platinum-drug transporter is intriguing because the physiologic and chemical
properties in copper and cDDP are different (controversy
number 1). However, a recent study using the site-speciﬁc
mutagenization approach showed that amino acid residues
involved in hCtr1-mediated cDDP transport are generally also
required for copper transport, although differences in transport kinetics (Km and Vmax values) exist (4). There are also
reports that hCtr1 copy numbers in genetically engineered cell
lines were not proportionally correlated with rates of copper
and cDDP uptake (5, 6), despite many studies showing that
elevated expression of hCtr1 confers cDDP sensitivity (7, 8).
However, these genetically engineered cell lines were generated by transfection with recombinant hCtr1 cDNA. Whether

hCtr1 in Copper Homeostasis Regulation and Platinum-Drug Chemotherapy

all of the transfected hCtr1 is functional is not known, in light
of our new understanding of the hCtr1 regulation mechanism,
which is constrained within the context of overall copper
homeostasis regulation (see below).
The importance of Ctr1 in cDDP transport overall can be
found in Ctr1-knockout mouse embryonic ﬁbroblast Ctr1/
cells. These Ctr1-null cells display only 30% to 35% of residual
cDDP transport activity in reference to the Ctr1þ/þ counterpart (9). This study showed that hCtr1 can also transport
CBDCA with reduced efﬁciency and that L-OHP is a poor
substrate for hCtr1 (9).
The clinical relevance of hCtr1 expression and platinumdrug cancer chemotherapy was reported by Ishida and colleagues (10). These investigators analyzed an array-based hCtr1
expression data set consisting of 91 patients with ovarian
cancer who had been treated with a platinum drug and a
taxane and found a correlation between high hCtr1 expression
levels and longer disease-free survival times. We analyzed an
independent gene expression database published by Tothill
and colleagues (11), derived from 285 serous and endometrioid
tumors of the ovary, peritoneum, and fallopian tube, and found
that patients with elevated hCtr1 expression in their tumors
had more favorable outcomes after platinum-drug treatment
than did those expressing low hCtr1 levels (12). It is important
to emphasize that this correlation was at the hCtr1 mRNA
expression level. A similar correlation was found in platinumbased therapy for lung cancer (13).
Importantly, recent studies have shown that levels of hCtr1
expression can be modulated by manipulating the cellular
bioavailable copper pool (14–16). These ﬁndings have resulted
in a phase I clinical trial in advanced ovarian cancer chemotherapy at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer
Center that uses a copper chelator (trientine) as an enhancer
for CBDCA treatment (17).

Key Finding: Copper Chelation Induces hCtr1
Expression and Chemosensitization to cDDP
Treatment
The conceptual development of using copper chelators
as chemosensitizers for platinum-drug treatment evolved
from our previous study using cell lines overproducing
glutathione (GSH), by transfection with recombinant DNA
encoding the heavy subunit of g-glutamylcysteine synthetase
(g-GCSh), a rate-limiting enzyme for de novo biosynthesis of
GSH. These g-GCSh/GSH–overproducing cells exhibited elevated hCtr1 expression and increased sensitivity to cDDP
treatment. These transfected cell lines exhibited reduced
cellular bioavailable copper content, as evidenced by the
reduced activities of several copper-containing enzymes,
because GSH is an abundant physiologic copper chelator
(14). These phenotypes were reversed when the elevated
GSH levels were reduced. This ﬁnding was contradictory to
the vast amount of previously published results showing that
induction of g-GCSh/GSH expression was responsible for
cDDP resistance, because GSH is an important cytoprotector
(inconsistency number 2). However, it is important to note
that all these reports of cDDP-resistant cells were published

www.aacrjournals.org

before the discovery that hCtr1 is a cDDP transporter and
that recent results have shown that most, if not all, cDDPresistant variants contain various degrees of reduced hCtr1
levels (7). Elevated expression of g-GCSh/GSH levels in these
cDDP-resistant cells could be explained as being due to the
oxidative stress-induced mechanism during drug treatment,
because GSH is an important ROS sensor and/or regulator.
Consistent with this notion are the observations that elevated g-GCSh/GSH expression can be found in cells treated
with other prooxidants, including cytokines, antitumor
agents, and carcinogens; but no enhanced cDDP resistance
was associated with these treatments (see review in ref. 18
and references therein). Induction of hCtr1 expression by
copper-lowering agents was further conﬁrmed with the use
of additional copper-lowering agents (15, 16).

The Role of hCtr1 in the Regulation of Copper
Homeostasis in Cultured Cells
To understand how copper chelation induces hCtr1 expression, it is important to elucidate how mammalian copper
homeostasis is regulated. Mechanisms of copper homeostasis
maintenance are evolutionarily conserved from yeasts, fruit
ﬂies, and plants, to humans. Steady-state cellular copper levels
are maintained by a balance among copper transporters (Ctr1),
copper chaperones (Atox1 for intracellular distribution), copper storage (Ctr2), and copper exporters (ATP7A and ATP7B).
All of these transporters can also transport cDDP (7). However,
Ctr1 is an important regulator in response to environmental
copper stresses.
We recently showed that copper deﬁciency induced by
treating human cancer cells with copper chelators, or by
expressing a dominant-negative hCtr1 recombinant, upregulates hCtr1 expression, whereas copper sufﬁciency achieved by
treating cells with CuSO4, or by overexpressing the wild-type
hCtr1 recombinant, downregulates endogenous hCtr1 expression (4, 15, 16). The upregulation or downregulation of hCtr1
under these 2 different copper-stressed conditions is respectively, controlled by Sp1 binding to or dissociating from the GC
boxes located at the hCtr1 promoter. Not only hCtr1, but also
Sp1 itself, is regulated by copper bioavailability (Fig. 1A). Thus,
human copper homeostasis is regulated by the Cu-Sp1-hCtr1
interregulatory loop (Fig. 1B). This regulatory loop uses Sp1
oscillation in regulating hCtr1 expression to rebalance the
cellular copper budget (15). The sensing mechanism of copper
bioavailability by Sp1 lies on the zinc ﬁnger (ZF) domains
located at the C terminus of Sp1. Copper stress–induced
transcription regulation of Ctr1 in other organisms also uses
ZF motifs in the transcription regulators as sensors in response
to copper inadequacies (19).
Posttranslational regulation mechanisms have also been
reported for regulating hCtr1 by copper stresses. High copper
levels induce trafﬁcking of hCtr1 from the plasma membrane
to the endosomal and/or lysosomal compartments, in which
hCtr1 may (20) or may not (21) be degraded. cDDP-induced
internalization of hCtr1 was also reported (22), but in another
report, cDDP treatment did not internalize hCtr1, but rather
induced hCtr1 stabilization through protein cross-linking (23).

enhanced promoter binding of Sp1 to these genes (a); copper sufﬁciency prevents Sp1 binding to these promoters (b). B, the Cu-Sp1-hCtr1 interregulatory
loop for copper homeostasis regulation. Reducing the copper levels (downward arrow), either by treating cells with copper chelators or by expressing the
hCtr1 dominant-negative recombinant, upregulates Sp1 and hCtr1 expression (upward arrows); likewise, increasing the copper levels, either by treating cells
with CuSO4 or by transfection with wild-type hCtr1 cDNA, downregulates Sp1 and hCtr1 expression. C, magnitudes of hCtr1 regulation by copper
bioavailabilities depend upon the intrinsic hCtr1 levels. Low hCtr1-expressing cells exhibit greater magnitudes of hCtr1 induction than do high hCtr1expressing cells by copper chelator (red lines); likewise, greater reduction in hCtr1 induction was observed in high hCtr1-expressing cells by copper treatment
than in low hCtr1-expressing cells (purple lines).

Although the source for this inconsistency (number 3) is not
certain, it is most likely due to different anti-hCtr1 antibodies
used in these studies, because Ctr1 is an evolutionarily conserved protein and a good anti-hCtr1 antibody has been
difﬁcult to obtain. Anti-hCtr1 antibodies prepared from different laboratories often showed different antigen recognition
patterns by Western blotting. Even the "monomeric hCtr1"
detected by these antibodies often showed different molecular
masses. In addition, there is a report that copper bioavailability
also regulates hCtr1 protein stability (24). Regardless, the
mechanistic insight into these posttranslational regulation
mechanisms requires further elucidation, particularly from
the copper homeostasis point of view.
This Cu-Sp1-hCtr1 interregulatory mechanism suggests the
following scenarios in copper homeostasis control: This regulatory mechanism is dynamic: changes in 1 component would
feed forward to affect levels of the other 2, resulting in a new
equilibrium. This dynamic regulation mechanism may explain
why the magnitudes of hCtr1 and Sp1 regulated by copper
stresses are small (most often within 2-fold) in most cell
settings and may often be disregarded as being within normal
experimental variations. This scenario underscores the importance of using qualitatively and quantitatively reliable measurement methods, such as isoform-speciﬁc hCtr probes in the

4618

Cancer Res; 72(18) September 15, 2012

RNase protection assay (15, 16). This regulation loop is tightly
controlled, indicating that there are maximal and minimal
ranges in which each of these components can swing. This
scenario suggests that the magnitudes of hCtr1 regulation
depend on the intrinsic (basal) hCtr1 levels and that cells with
high levels of hCtr1 expression would have greater magnitudes
of hCtr1 downregulation than would those expressing reduced
levels of hCtr1 when exposed to copper. Likewise, cells expressing reduced levels of hCtr1 would have a greater amplitude of
hCtr1 upregulation by copper chelators than would those expressing higher levels (Fig. 1C). This second scenario is particularly relevant to platinum-based chemotherapy, given
the observations that tumor cells expressing reduced levels
of hCtr1 are often associated with cDDP resistance because of
reduced cDDP transport capacity (7, 8). Greater induction of
hCtr1 expression by copper chelators would have greater
platinum transport for cell killing; this has been shown in
3 pairs of cDDP-resistant cell lines (12). In cancer chemotherapy, initial treatment using platinum drugs would eradicate
the high hCtr1-expressing population and spare cells intrinsically resistant to cDDP. The ability to resensitize these
intrinsic platinum-resistant cells by copper chelators would
improve the treatment efﬁcacy of platinum drugs in cancer
chemotherapy.

hCtr1 in Copper Homeostasis Regulation and Platinum-Drug Chemotherapy

Issues Relevant to the Clinical Use of
Copper-Lowering Agents as cDDP Enhancers
The phase I pilot study done at MD Anderson Cancer Center
to evaluate the concept of using copper chelators for improving
the effectiveness of platinum drugs involved 5 patients with
platinum-resistant high-grade epithelial ovarian cancers.
These patients were treated with trientiene and CBDCA. Two
patients experienced severe adverse events that included
myelosuppression, especially anemia requiring transfusion.
Dose-limiting toxicity was not observed within the ﬁrst 28
days. After 2 cycles of therapy, partial remission was achieved
in 1 patient (10þ months), stable disease in 3 patients (2, 3.5þ,
and 5 months, respectively), and progressive disease in 1
patient. Better tumor responses were associated with greater
decreases in copper levels using the surrogate biomarker
serum ceruloplasmin (17). This study provides the ﬁrst-inhuman preliminary data showing that platinum resistance in
tumors could be, at least partially, overcome in some patients
through the use of a copper-lowering agent. Further study
using a larger patient population with improved strategies (see
below) is warranted. In the meantime, several relevant issues
are discussed below.
First, copper-lowering agents such as trientine and D-penicillamine have been used for more than 4 decades for treating
copper toxicosis in Wilson disease, a genetic disorder caused
by defects in ATP7B. Another copper-lowering agent, tetrathiomolybdate (TM), has been in clinical trials as an antitumor
agent. Copper is a cofactor required for several angiogenic
mediators, including VEGF, basic ﬁbroblast growth factor,
interleukin-1 (IL-1), and IL-8 (25). It has been shown that many
patients with malignancies of the breast, colon, lung, prostate,
and brain display elevated copper contents in their serum and
tumors (25). Copper-lowering agents have been used in monotherapy by targeting the angiogenic growth mechanisms of the
tumors (26). Combining copper-lowering agents and platinum
drugs in cancer chemotherapy may have additive antitumor
effects (and may also have additive cytotoxicities; see below).
This strategy is essentially a new use of old drugs and, therefore
if proven, would be a low-cost treatment option for patients
with cancer.
Second, although the trientine/CBDCA protocol is targeting
platinum-resistant tumors with reduced hCtr1 expression,
mechanisms of cDDP resistance are multifactorial, and
reduced hCtr1 alone is not the only reason for drug resistance.
Other factors, including elevated ATP7A/ATP7B transporters
(27) and hCtr2 (28), may also affect the treatment efﬁcacy. To
maximize the effect of copper chelators, determination of
biomarkers associated with various cDDP resistance mechanisms should be very helpful to stratify patients who may beneﬁt
most from the treatment.
Third, the effectiveness of copper-lowering agents in
enhancing hCtr1 expression in vivo is a critical issue. A previous
study of rats fed a copper-deﬁcient diet failed to show
increased Ctr1 mRNA levels in livers and small intestines,
despite a substantial loss in copper levels in these organs
(69% to 89% reduction), as correspondingly compared with
those in animals fed a copper-adequate diet (29). A cervical

www.aacrjournals.org

tumor model developed in transgenic HPV16/E2 mice showed
elevated mCtr1 protein levels as compared with those in the
normal cervix. TM treatments did not show further induction
of mCtr1 expression in the tumor lesions of transgenic mice,
nor was it seen in the cervix of the wild-type animals (10). In
contrast, increased mCtr1 expression was found in several
organs (kidney, duodenum, and brain) in copper-deﬁcient,
postnatal day-16 mice fed copper-deﬁcient diets (30). Aside
from the technical issues related to Ctr1 measurement as
mentioned and because different tissue sources were used in
these studies, this inconsistency (number 4) may reﬂect the
complexity of in vivo Ctr1 regulation mechanisms. Further
investigations are needed to address the following important
issues: (i) The in vivo Ctr1-regulation mechanism by copper
deprivation may be more stringent than the in vitro system
using cultured cells; (ii) Elevated Ctr1 expression may be an
intrinsic mechanism associated with tumor development; this
may explain why elevated copper levels were observed in many
human malignancies (25) and in the HPV16/E2 cervical tumors
(10). Moreover, failure to further induce tumoric mCtr1 expression in the HPV16/E2 tumors by TM may be explained by the
fact that these tumors already express elevated levels of mCtr1
(Fig. 1C); and (iii) the effectiveness of copper-lowering agents in
enhancing cDDP sensitivity may be tissue speciﬁc: tissues
expressing high levels of hCtr1 may be less sensitive to copper
chelation-induced Ctr1 expression than those expressing
reduced hCtr1 levels. A better understanding of hCtr1 expression in response to copper-chelation treatment in different
settings may eventually lead to the use of hCtr1 inducibility as a
predictor for the treatment outcome of platinum-drug therapy.
Fourth, drug-induced toxicity is also an important issue.
Both copper chelators and cDDP are redox-active compounds
and cause oxidative damage to cells. Combination therapy may
exacerbate toxicity, resulting in a myriad of pathophysiologic
consequences. In cancer chemotherapy, although cDDP is
known to cause toxicities in many organs, including the kidney,
nerve, ear, and bone marrow, CBDCA, which is known as the
second-generation antitumor platinum drug, displays a great
deal fewer toxicities in these organs, except bone marrow.
Copper chelators are also known to cause bone marrow
damage associated with anemia and/or leukopenia and worsen neurologic symptoms in Wilson disease (26). Accordingly,
bone morrow seems to be the most likely target for the adverse
events associated with copper chelator/CBDCA combination
therapy. This event, indeed, occurred in our preliminary trientine/CBDCA trial, which involved only 5 patients with
advanced ovarian cancer (17).
Clinical experience shows that the adverse effects inﬂicted
by CBDCA and by copper-chelator therapy could be overcome
when treatments were discontinued, indicating that the treatment-induced adverse events may be manageable. Consequently, we offer some suggestions: (i) modify the treatment
schedule to sequential administration of a copper chelator ﬁrst
to induce hCtr1 expression, followed by CBDCA treatment to
optimize the antitumor efﬁcacy; (ii) carefully design a treatment holiday to minimize the cytotoxicities; and (iii) critically
evaluate the combinations between CBDCA and various
copper-lowering agents. These strategies may eventually

improve the overall therapeutic index for the use of copperchelator and CBDCA combinations.
And ﬁfth, recent studies have shown that cancer-initiating
cells in human malignancies are resistant to cDDP (31).
Although these cDDP-resistant cells may be in small populations and present in special niches, they are highly tumorigenic
in the immunocompromised mice. Currently, we know very
little about cDDP-resistance mechanisms associated with this
tumor population. This drug-resistant population may be the
most difﬁcult target for complete elimination by chemotherapy. The role of hCtr1 in cDDP resistance in these cancerinitiating cells remains to be investigated.

Concluding Remarks and Perspectives
The discovery that Ctr1 can also transport platinum drugs
has bridged the gap between 2 seemingly unrelated research
ﬁelds: copper physiology and platinum-based cancer chemotherapy. Studies of the molecular basis of copper homeostasis
regulated by copper-stressed conditions have resulted in
ongoing clinical studies that use copper-lowering agents to
enhance platinum-treatment efﬁcacy for cancer chemotherapy. Although results await future large randomized studies, this
treatment strategy is particularly attractive because it targets
cDDP-resistant tumors, which are known to be difﬁcult.
Although both copper-lowering agents and platinum drugs
have been extensively studied for a long time, much remains to
be learned. Importantly, more investigations are needed to
critically address many relevant issues mentioned in this

article. Research aimed at a better understanding of how
the platinum-drug transport capacity can be enhanced
through hCtr1 upregulation and how the unwanted cytotoxicity can be simultaneously minimized may eventually facilitate the development of an effective copper-chelation strategy
to combat the drug-resistance problem in platinum-based
cancer chemotherapy.
