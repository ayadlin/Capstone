ABSTRACT
We investigated the microtubule-destabilizing, vascular-targeting, anti-tumor
and anti-metastatic activities of a new series of chalcones, whose prototype compound
is (E)-3-(3’’-amino-4’’-methoxyphenyl)-1-(5’-methoxy-3’,4’-methylendioxyphenyl)2-methylprop-2-en-1-one (TUB091). X-ray crystallography showed that these
chalcones bind to the colchicine site of tubulin and therefore prevent the curved-tostraight structural transition of tubulin, which is required for microtubule formation.
Accordingly, TUB091 inhibited cancer and endothelial cell growth, induced G2/M
phase arrest and apoptosis at 1-10 nM. In addition, TUB091 displayed vascular
disrupting effects in vitro and in the chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay
at low nanomolar concentrations. A water-soluble L-Lys-L-Pro derivative of TUB091
(i.e. TUB099) showed potent antitumor activity in melanoma and breast cancer
xenograft models by causing rapid intratumoral vascular shutdown and massive
tumor necrosis. TUB099 also displayed anti-metastatic activity similar to that of
combretastatin A4-phosphate. Our data indicate that this novel class of chalcones
represents interesting lead molecules for the design of vascular disrupting agents
(VDAs). Moreover, we provide evidence that our prodrug approach may be valuable
for the development of anti-cancer drugs.

INTRODUCTION

is complementary to other existing therapies [3–5]. VDAs
act directly and selectively at the tumor endothelium
inducing detrimental morphological and functional
changes. Consequently, blood flow inside the tumor is
quickly and dramatically decreased resulting in massive
necrosis due to the hypoxic conditions [6]. The selectivity
of VDAs for tumor endothelium versus physiological
vessels lies in the crucial differences between these
vessels [4, 6]. Tumor vessels are characterized by a higher

Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide and
its occurrence is expected to double in the following
decades [1]. Resistance and lack of efficacy associated
with current antineoplastic treatments demand the design
of novel anticancer drugs [2]. Vascular Disrupting Agents
(VDAs) constitute an innovative approach in anticancer
therapy due to their specific mechanism of action, which

a synthetic chalcone with significant antitumor effects in
vitro and in vivo [18]. Other chalcones have been designed
and synthesized with the purpose to enhance the chemical
stability of CA-4 [11, 19].
Here, we synthesized new colchicine-site binders
with a chalcone scaffold, along with a dioxolane motif
at ring A, according to its abundant presence in natural
colchicine-site ligands. X-ray crystallography was
performed to gain detailed insight into the binding mode
of this family of chalcones. The anti-proliferative and antivascular properties of the compounds were determined
and a prodrug strategy was applied in order to improve the
water solubility of the most active compound (TUB091).
This prodrug (TUB099) was shown to possess potent antitumor and vascular-disrupting activities in primary tumor
models and proved as potent as the reference compound
CA-4P in inhibiting spontaneous metastasis induced by
human breast cancer MDA-MB-231 cells.

proliferation rate and the lack of pericytes and a proper
basement membrane, which makes them more fragile and
tortuous than physiological vessels [6, 7]. Overall, this
results in increased vascular permeability and a higher
resistance to blood flow, making the tumor vasculature
more sensitive to any variation in perfusion pressure [8, 9].
The best studied VDAs are microtubule-destabilizing
agents that bind the αβ-tubulin dimer at the colchicinebinding site. The most representative compounds are
combretastatin A4 (CA-4, 1, Figure  1) and its prodrugs
(CA-4 phosphate (2) or the serine derivative AVE-8062
(3)) [10, 11]. In general, colchicine-site binders, when
affecting tumor endothelial cells, block tubulin assembly
into microtubules, which in turn induces a large cascade
of events, such as actin stress fiber contraction and the
subsequent activation of Rho kinases. Consequently,
endothelial cells round up and lose their connectivity,
leading to vascular collapse, tumor hypoxia and finally
hemorrhagic tumor necrosis [12]. In addition, colchicinesite binders are also able to behave as antimitotic agents
[13]. This antimitotic effect is closely related to the
importance of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the
formation of the mitotic spindle during cell division [14].
As a consequence, several colchicine-site binders are
currently being evaluated clinically in different combination
regimens for the treatment of a variety of solid tumors [15].
Besides colchicine (4, Figure 1) and CA-4,
natural products continue to be a source of microtubuledestabilizing agents binding at the colchicine-site. We have
centered our attention at those compounds that include a
dioxolane group at ring A, such as combretastatin A2 [16],
polygamain [17] or cornigerin [13]. Another interesting
group of natural product-inspired compounds binding at
the colchicine-site are chalcones, such as MDL-27048,

RESULTS
Synthesis of the chalcones
The synthesis of the chalcones involved an aldol
condensation between a phenone fused to a dioxolane
ring (A ring) and the corresponding benzaldehyde (ring
B). First, we envisioned the synthesis of the unsubstituted
chalcones at the α position of the α,β-unsaturated ketone
(Supplementary Scheme 1). This resulted in chalcones 5–9
(Figure 1) of which 5 and 9 with a hydroxyl or an amine
group at position 3 of ring B, respectively, showed the best
growth-inhibitory activity (Table 1, see further). Based on
these data the second series of chalcones (Supplementary
Scheme 1), incorporating a methyl group at the α position

Chalcones bind to the colchicine-site of tubulin

of the α,β-unsaturated ketone, contained only those
compounds whose B-ring had the same substitution as
5 and 9, thus providing compounds 10 (TUB092) and
11 (TUB091) (Figure 1).

Using impedance-based monitoring of cell growth,
we found a time- and dose-dependent anti-mitotic
signature in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with
TUB091. At concentrations higher than 5 nM, TUB091
caused a rapid and continuous decrease in cell index,
indicative of reduced cell adhesion and/or toxicity. Using
lower concentrations of TUB091, a decrease in cell index
during the first 14 h and subsequent recovery during the
next 24–48 h was observed, typical for tubulin-targeting
agents [20] (Figure 2A). Accordingly, staining of the
microtubules in MDA-MB-231 cells after 15 h treatment
with TUB091 resulted in the appearance of aberrant
spindles. At 10 and 5 nM of TUB091, highly irregular
and multipolar spindles were noticed, leading to a high
number of cells in (pro)metaphase incapable of proceeding
to telophase (Figure 2B), while at 2.5 nM the majority of
cells underwent proper cell division.
The affinity of the compounds for bovine αβ-tubulin
was studied by competition experiments with R-PT,
whose binding to tubulin is characterized by fluorescence
emission (Ka of 3.2 × 106 M−1) [21, 22]. The binding
constant obtained for compound 10 by R-PT displacement
was (1.3 ± 0.2) × 107 M−1, similar to the reported value for
colchicine (1.2 × 107 M−1 at 37°C). Since the binding of
TUB091 to tubulin resulted in a change of the fluorescence
emission with the same excitation wavelength of R-PT, the
binding constant of TUB091 to tubulin was determined by

Growth-inhibitory activity of the chalcones
The synthesized compounds were first evaluated for
their growth-inhibitory activity in cancer and endothelial
cell lines (Table 1). As reference compounds CA-4P (2)
and colchicine (4) were included. Among unsubstituted
chalcones at the α-position (5–9), compounds 5 and
9, with a 3-hydroxy or 3-amine group at ring B,
respectively, showed 50% inhibitory values (IC50) in
the sub-micromolar range. The introduction of a methyl
group at the α-position of the double bond (compounds
10 and 11) significantly improved the growth-inhibitory
activity. Importantly, the aminochalcone 11 (TUB091),
with IC50 values between 1 and 4 nM, proved to be even
more active than the reference compounds in all cell
lines tested (Table  1). CA-4P as well as TUB091 also
inhibited the growth of normal fibroblasts and peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in the nanomolar range
(Supplementary Table 1). However, it should be noted
that, whereas the compounds were toxic at micromolar
concentrations in tumor and endothelial cells (see further),
they were not toxic up to 100 µM in PBMCs as evidenced
by the fact that a slight growth of these cells was still
observed at 100 µM of compound.

displacement of the fluorescence of this compound by 10.
TUB091 showed a Ka of (1.1 ± 0.1) × 107 M–1 similar to
that of 10 and colchicine.
To gain detailed insights into the binding of
these chalcones to tubulin [23], we soaked compound
10 (TUB092, Figure 3A) into crystals of a protein complex
composed of two αβ-tubulin (T2), the stathmin-like protein
RB3 (R) and tubulin tyrosine ligase (TTL) [24, 25], and
determined the crystal structure of the liganded TUB092
(T2R-TTL-TUB092) at 2.4 Å resolution (Supplementary
Table 2). The overall structure of tubulin in the T2R-TTLTUB092 complex superimposes with low rmsd of 0.236
Å (776 Cα atoms) onto the one obtained in the absence
of the ligand (PDB-ID 4I55) [24, 25]. The binding site
is formed by residues of strands S8 and S9, loop T7 and
helices H7 and H8 of β-tubulin and of loop T5 of α-tubulin
(Figure 3B).
The 1,3-benzodioxole ring (ring A) of TUB092
points into the hydrophobic pocket formed by the side
chains of β-tubulin residues Cys241, Leu242, Leu248,
Ala250, Leu255, Met259, Ala316, Ile318 Lys352, Ala354
and Ile378 and forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond to
the backbone carbonyl and amide of Gly237 and Cys241,
respectively (Figure 3C, 3D). The linker carbonyl of
TUB092 is in hydrogen-bond distance to the backbone
amide of Asp251. The hydroxyl and methoxy-groups at
ring B form one direct and two water-mediated hydrogen
bonds to the backbone carbonyls of Thr179 and Asn349,
respectively. Moreover, both the 1,3-benzodioxole and the
2-methoxyphenol moieties are stacked between the side
chains of Cys241 and Leu255, and between Asn258 and
Lys352, respectively.
When the beta chains of the tubulin-colchicine
and the tubulin-TUB092 structures were superimposed
(Figure  3E), both the 2-methoxyphenol and the linker
moieties of TUB092 overlay well with the C-ring and
parts of the B and A rings of colchicine. Moreover, two
methoxy- and the hydroxyl-groups of TUB092 occupy the
same positions as the corresponding groups in colchicine.
The simpler scaffold of TUB092 allows the T5-loop
residue Thr179 of α-tubulin to flip in and occupy a space
that is occupied by two water molecules in the tubulincolchicine complex structure (Figure 3F).

Induction of apoptosis was confirmed by measuring (i) the
translocation of phosphatidylserine from the cytoplasmic
to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane
(Supplementary Figure 1) and (ii) the activation of
caspase-3 by TUB091 (Figure 4B).

TUB091 displays anti-vascular effects in vitro
and in the CAM assay
Vascular-disrupting agents not only affect tumor
but also endothelial cells. Indeed TUB091, colchicine
and CA-4P dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation
of macrovascular HUVEC and microvascular HMEC1 cells. Whereas the compounds showed a comparable
inhibitory activity in HMEC-1 cells, TUB091 proved
about 10-fold more cytostatic than CA-4P and 100-fold
more active than colchicine in HUVEC cells (Figure 5A).
TUB091 (≥ 10 nM) also induced the accumulation of
HMEC-1 cells in G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Figure 5B)
and induced apoptosis, even at 1 nM (Figure 5B, 5C). In
addition, TUB091 and CA-4P prevented the closure of a
wound created in a confluent monolayer of HMEC-1 cells
(Figure 5D).
As shown in Figure 6A, both CA-4P and TUB091
dose-dependently abrogated the integrity of a preformed vascular network of endothelial cells. TUB091
also elicited anti-angiogenic and vascular-disrupting
effects in vivo. Using the CAM gelatin sponge assay, the
number of newly formed microvessels directed towards
the sponge containing 3 nmol of TUB091 or CA-4P
was reduced by more than 50% compared with DMSOcontaining sponges (Figure 6B). Histological examination
of the CAMs showed a complete disappearance of the
intermediate mesenchyme without any cellular and
vascular components in the TUB091-treated CAMs, as
compared to control (Figure 6C). Using larger plastic
discs that contain the dried compound, both neovessel
formation (angiogenesis) as well as vascular-disrupting
activity can be investigated at the CAM area under the
disc. A dose-dependent effect on both processes could be
observed. Indeed, at 3 nmol, TUB091 completely blocked
the formation of new blood vessels in nearly all CAMs
tested and also caused damage and bleeding to immature,
already existing vessels (Figure 6D). At 1 nmol/ disc,
angiogenesis was inhibited, but larger vessels were not
affected (Figure 6D).

TUB091 induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231
human breast cancer cells
Tubulin staining of TUB091-treated MDAMB-231 cell cultures (Figure 2B) suggested that the
compound causes mitotic arrest. Using flow cytometry,
an accumulation of cells in G2/M phase was observed
after 24 h treatment with 10 nM TUB091 (Figure 4A).
More strikingly, the compound caused a dose-dependent
increase in sub G1 cells, exhibiting a sub-diploid DNA
content characteristic of apoptotic cells (45% ± 9 and
19%  ± 8 at 10 and 1 nM of TUB091, respectively).

Prodrug synthesis
All these data point to a vascular-disrupting and antiangiogenic effect of TUB091 accompanied by induction of
tumor cell apoptosis. However, its low aqueous solubility
precluded in vivo evaluation. Therefore, we synthesized
prodrugs of TUB091 by conjugation with L-Ser as in
AVE-8062 (3) or with an L-Lys-L-Pro dipeptide (12 and
13, Supplementary Methods). The latter was based on our

drugs by coupling to di- or oligopeptides and subsequent
release by the endogenous enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase
IV (DPP-IV/CD26) [26].
The L-Lys-L-Pro derivative 13 (TUB099, Figure
7A) was ~2000-fold more soluble than the parent
drug (Figure 7B) and nearly as effective as TUB091 in

inhibiting tumor and endothelial cell proliferation (Figure
7C). Incubation of TUB099 in human serum or murine
liver extract showed an efficient release of TUB091
(Figure 7D). Biological assays further demonstrated that
TUB099 possesses vascular-disrupting activity in vitro
(Figure 7E) and induces G2/M phase arrest and apoptosis
in endothelial and tumor cells (not shown).

TUB099 inhibits primary tumor growth and
spontaneous metastasis in mice

12, or for 4 consecutive days (day 12 till 15). Whereas
control tumors continued to grow, a dramatic decrease in
luminescent signal was noted in the TUB099 group within
2 days after start of treatment (Figure 8C). TUB099
proved also significantly more active than the reference
compound CA-4P. However, caliper measurement of
tumor size did not reveal a difference between control
and treated groups (not shown). Since light emission by
firefly luciferase requires oxygen and ATP, which are
only present in living cells, our data indicate that, already
within 48 h after start of treatment, TUB099-treated tumor
cells were dead and/or lacked oxygen, effects that are
typically seen with VDAs.
At day 16 after cell inoculation, primary tumors were
removed and all mice were left untreated. Three weeks
later, lung and/or lymph node metastases were present
in 90% of control mice of the 4-day treatment group. In
contrast, only 40% of CA-4P-treated mice developed
metastases, and metastases were completely undetectable
(based on luminescence measurement) in TUB099-treated
mice (Figure 8D). Interestingly, among the 1-day treatment
groups, metastases development was less evident.

To determine the in vivo antitumor activity of
TUB099, melanoma and breast cancer models were
used  [27]. First, B16-F10.luc2 melanoma cells were
injected subcutaneously (s.c.) in SCID mice. TUB099
was injected intratumorally (i.t.) at 10 mg/kg for
5 consecutive days starting at day 3, when small tumors
were macroscopically visible. Tumor growth was
measured by in vivo imaging until day 10, when TUB099treated tumors were no longer visible (Figure 8A). By
day 17, TUB099 tumors had slightly regrown but were
significantly smaller than control tumors (p < 0.001,
Figure 8B). Only a slight, non-significant, decrease in
body weight was noted (Supplementary Figure 2). Thus,
in an early stage of tumor development, TUB099 exerts a
potent anti-tumor effect when administered i.t.
Next, MDA-MB-231/4mRL.luc2 human breast
cancer cells were injected into the mammary fad pad
of SCID mice and the compounds (TUB099 or CA-4P)
were administered i.t. at 15 mg/kg either once at day

removed and processed for histology, no difference was
observed in tumor size at day 16 (Figure 9B).

and showed massive staining of the proliferation
marker Ki67 (Figure 9C), tumors obtained from CA-4P
and TUB099-treated mice showed very little staining
for  Ki67, and no blood vessels in the tumor center
(Figure 9C).
Again primary tumors were removed at day 16. By
day 21 after tumor resection, 45% of the control mice were
metastasized. CA-4P showed an anti-metastatic activity
at 30 mg/kg (13% of mice with metastasis), whereas
TUB099 proved equally effective in inhibiting metastasis
at 15 and  30 mg/kg (20% of mice with metastasis)
(not shown).
Together, our data indicate that TUB099 induces
rapid intratumoral vascular collapse, leading to massive
tumor necrosis, with a potency similar to that of the
reference compound CA-4P. Moreover, TUB099
effectively reduced spontaneous metastasis, occurring
after resection of the primary tumors.

from the helices H8 and H7, the beta strand S9 and the
T7 loop of β-tubulin and from the T5 loop of α-tubulin.
This observation suggests that TUB092 cannot bind to
the colchicine-site in preformed microtubules. Thus,
the microtubule-destabilizing activity of TUB092 likely
consists in preventing the curved to-straight structural
transition in tubulin by the bound ligand, as previously
reported for other colchicine-site ligands [23, 36].
Together, our data demonstrate that the newly
synthesized chalcones destabilize microtubules by binding
to the colchicine-site of tubulin. This destabilization
causes depolymerization of the mitotic spindles leading
to the lack of DNA organization into a metaphase plate.
Immunocytochemistry showed a dose-dependent increase
in (pro)metaphase cells containing abnormal mitotic
spindles, in the presence of TUB091. Accordingly,
TUB091 caused an arrest of tumor and endothelial cells
in G2/M phase and induced apoptosis in these cells at
nanomolar concentrations.
Furthermore, we found a potent and dose-dependent
inhibition of other endothelial cell-specific responses.
Indeed, TUB091 inhibited endothelial cell migration
and angiogenesis in the CAM assay. The compound also
caused the disruption of an existing network of endothelial
tubes in vitro and the degradation of newly formed,
immature vessels in the CAM assay. In contrast, the
larger, mature vasculature was not affected by TUB091.
Indeed, significant structural differences exist between
immature and mature vasculature. While immature
vessels rely on microtubules for structural support and
are particularly sensitive to VDAs, mature vessels are
supported by pericytes and a solid basement membrane
and are therefore protected from disruption by VDAs [37].
Previously, prodrugs of combretastatins were
developed to overcome solubility limitations that
precluded clinical testing. Sodium phosphate salt
derivatives of CA-4 (CA-4P) and CA-1 (CA-1P) and the
L-serine prodrug of an amino derivative of CA-4 (AVE8062, rapidly advanced to clinical trials [reviewed in
[5]). We have extensively investigated the development
of oligopeptide prodrugs that are efficiently release in
the presence of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV/CD26)
[26]. This enzyme, abundantly found in serum, mainly
hydrolyzes peptidic sequences containing an N-terminal
penultimate proline. In particular, drug conjugation with
an L-lysyl-L-prolyl dipeptide may significantly increase
the solubility due to the basicity of the N-terminal lysine,
while recognition by CD26 may enhance the in vivo
release of the parent drug. Indeed, the L-lysyl-L-prolyl
dipeptide prodrug of TUB091 (TUB099) displayed
2000-fold improved solubility compared to TUB091 and
efficiently released the parent drug. This prodrug inhibited
endothelial and tumor cell proliferation, induced apoptosis
and showed vascular-disrupting activity in cell culture.
In addition, when administered either intratumorally
(i.t.) or systemically (i.p.), TUB099 reduced the primary

DISCUSSION
The growth of solid tumors and their metastatic
dissemination are dependent on a functional blood
supply. Therefore, the tumor vasculature is considered
an attractive target for therapy [3, 28]. During the past
decades much effort has been devoted to the development
and clinical evaluation of anti-angiogenic drugs, which
inhibit the formation of new blood vessels [28, 29].
However, these compounds have largely failed in the
clinic because of resistance development, lack of efficacy
and/or toxicity. A complimentary approach also targeting
the tumor vasculature is the use of VDAs. These agents
destroy the existing, abnormal intratumoral vasculature,
leading to rapid vascular shutdown and extensive tumor
necrosis [3, 5]. The largest group of VDAs contains
microtubule-targeting agents, of which CA-4P is currently
under investigation in phase II clinical trials for a variety
of solid tumors [5, 30].
Here, we investigated the tubulin-binding, vasculartargeting, anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities of a new
series of chalcone derivatives. The best compound of this
series, TUB091, inhibited the proliferation of endothelial
and tumor cell lines with 50% inhibitory concentrations
of 1–4 nM, which is slightly better than the reference
compounds colchicine and CA-4P.
Using X-ray crystallography we showed that the
chalcones bind to tubulin at the colchicine-site. While
free tubulin dimers adopt a characteristic “curved”
conformation in solution [31, 32], tubulin dimers that
are incorporated in microtubules undergo a curved-tostraight structural transition [33, 34]. This process is
necessary for microtubule formation and is associated with
a rearrangement of several secondary structural elements
thereby occluding the colchicine-site [23, 35, 36]. The
superposition of the modeled tubulin-TUB092 structure in
the context of the straight conformational state of tubulin
showed several potential clashes of TUB092 with residues

breast cancer MDA-MB-231/4mRL.luc2 cells in mice.
Whereas i.t. treatment of small tumors with TUB099
resulted in complete regression within 4 days, no
immediate macroscopic effect on tumor size was noted
when larger tumors were treated with TUB099 or CA-4P.
Interestingly, already 2 hours after compound injection,
a prominent reduction in luminescence was observed,
indicative of vascular shutdown and consequently reduced
tumor cell perfusion. Accordingly, whereas PBS-treated
tumors were highly proliferative and vascularized, as
demonstrated by extensive Ki67 and CD31 staining,
immunohistochemical analysis of tumors dissected
2 days after treatment with TUB099 and CA-4P showed
massive necrosis in the tumor center, leaving only a small
viable rim. These effects are typically seen with vasculartargeting agents [37]. Since these peripheral tumor cells
are more accessible to conventional chemotherapy,
combretastatins are mainly used to complement traditional
anticancer treatments, including various cytostatic agents
or radiotherapy (reviewed in [5]).
To evaluate the effect of TUB099 on spontaneous
metastasis, primary tumors were removed after treatment.
Whereas some PBS-treated tumors regrew during the next
weeks, the mice that were previously treated with either
TUB099 or CA-4P remained tumor-free. Furthermore,
87% of control mice developed lung and/or lymph node
metastases within 4 weeks after tumor resection, whereas
metastases were only visible in 40% of CA-4P treated
animals and were completely absent in the TUB099
group. Interestingly, much less metastases were observed
in the control mice receiving just one i.t. injection of PBS,
compared to the mice that received PBS for 4 consecutive
days. These data suggest that i.t. injection may damage
tumor architecture and the intratumoral vasculature,
thereby facilitating the escape of tumor cells into the
circulation and their dissemination to distant organs [39].
Taken together, our data indicate that this series of
chalcones open a new horizon for the design of innovative
VDAs, since their interaction with their molecular target
has also been resolved and presented. Interestingly, they
show a superior antitumor activity over the reference VDA
CA-4P. Finally, we provide evidence that our prodrug
approach, that so far has been mainly used to develop more
soluble antivirals, may also be very valuable to improve
bioavailability of highly hydrophobic anti-cancer drugs.

Tubulin polymerization-determination of
binding constants

Fluorescence detection of caspase-3 activity in
live cells

Calf brain tubulin was purified as described
[22, 41]. (R)-(+)-ethyl 5-amino 2-methyl-1, 2-dihydro-3phenylpyrido[3, 4-b]pyrazin-7-yl carbamate (R-PT) was a
kind gift of Prof. Rener, Birmingham, Alabama [42].
The binding constant of TUB092 to tubulin was
determined by competition with R-PT [21, 22]. The
binding constant of TUB091 to tubulin was determined
by competition with TUB092. The fluorescence emission
spectra (excitation at 374 nm) of 0.4 µM Tubulin and
0.4 µM TUB091, 0.1 mM GTP pH 7.0, were measured in
the presence of growing concentrations of TUB092 using
a Jobin-Ybon SPEX Fluoromax-2 (HORIBA, Ltd. Kyoto,
Japan). The decrease of the fluorescence intensity of
TUB091 at the maximum upon incubation with TUB092
was used to determine the binding constant using Equigra
V5.0 as described [43]. 

MDA-MB-231 cells or HUVECs were seeded at
40,000 cells/cm² or 15,000 cells/cm² respectively. After
24 h, cells were incubated in Fluorobrite (Gibco)-containing
growth medium or HUVEC growth medium, with the
compound and 2 µM of the caspase-3 substrate DEVDNucView488 (Biotium, Hayward, CA). At indicated timepoints the DNA was stained with Hoechst33342 and the
cells were imaged by fluorescence microscopy.

Wound healing (scratch assay)
Wounds were created in confluent HMEC-1
monolayers with a 1.0-mm wide micropipette tip. Then,
cells were incubated in fresh medium containing the
compounds and 1 µg/ml of mitomycine C. After 18  h,
wounds were photographed and wound repair was
quantified by computerized analysis.

Crystallization, data collection, and structure
solution
Crystals of T2R-TTL were generated as described
[24, 25, 36]. Suitable T2R-TTL crystals were exchanged
into reservoir solutions containing 2 mM TUB092 and
soaked overnight. Soaked crystals were flash cooled
in liquid nitrogen following a brief transfer into cryo
solution containing 20% glycerol. T2R-TTL TUB-92 data
were collected at beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light
Source (Paul Scherrer Institut, Villigen, Switzerland).
Images were indexed and processed using XDS [44].

Tube destruction
Wells of a 96-well plate were coated with 70  µl
matrigel (10 mg/ml, BD Biosciences, Heidelberg,
Germany) at 4°C. After gelatinization at 37°C during
30 min, HMEC-1 cells were seeded at 60,000 cells/well on
top of the matrigel. After 3 h of incubation at 37°C, when
tube-like structures were detectable, compounds were
added. Ninety minutes later, tube destruction was evaluated
by giving a score from 0 to 3 (3: intact tubular network; 2:
missing connections and/or dead ends; 1: many separate,
small tubes that are not connected; 0: no tubes) [22].

3 days after cell injection and continued for 5 consecutive
days.
MDA.MB.231/4mRL.luc2 cells (106) were
suspended in 50 µL of 50% matrigel/PBS and injected
in the mammary fat pad of SCID mice. The mice were
treated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with vehicle, TUB099 or
CA-4P at day 14 or treated i.t. at day 12 or at day 12 till
day 15. At day 16, primary tumors were removed and
processed for histological examination. The growth of
the luciferase-positive tumor cells and the appearance
of metastases were quantified using the IVIS spectrum
imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences, Hopkinton, MA,
USA) [27, 49]. Before imaging, the mice were injected s.c.
with 200 µl of luciferin (15 mg/ml in PBS).

The in vivo CAM angiogenesis model was
performed as described [47, 48]. At day 9 of fertilization,
sterile plastic discs containing either vehicle or the
compound and cortisone acetate (100 µg/disc, Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) were placed on the CAM. Next, the eggs
were incubated until day 11 when the area around the discs
was cut-off and photographed. Results were analyzed by
two-tailed paired Student’s t-test. In another series of
experiments, gelatin sponges were used as vehicle, and
the number of blood vessels converging towards the
sponge were quantified, as described previously (48). For
histological examination, the CAM was fixed in ovo in
Bouin’s fluid, removed and processed for embedding in
paraffin. Ten-micrometer serial sections were cut parallel
to the surface of the CAM and observed under light
microscope without staining.

Immunohistochemical analysis of the tumors

An excess amount of the tested compound was
added to 400 µL PBS (1% DMSO), shaken at RT for
2 h and centrifuged. An aliquot of each supernatant
was analyzed by UV (Thermo Multiskan Spectrum) by
comparison with a five-point standard calibration curve.

IHC staining of the tumors was performed as
described [27]. Paraffin-embedded sections were stained
ON at 4°C with a rabbit anti-CD31 (4 µg/ml, Abcam) and
a rat anti-Ki67 (1 µg/ml, eBioscience) antibody. After
washing, sections were incubated for 3 h at RT with Alexa
Fluor 568 goat anti-rabbit antibody (4 µg/ml; Molecular
probes) and Dylight 650 conjugated goat anti-rat antibody
(4 µg/ml; Thermofisher) and examined by fluorescence
microscopy.
