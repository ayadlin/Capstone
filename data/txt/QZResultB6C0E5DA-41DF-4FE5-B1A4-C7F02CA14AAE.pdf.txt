Abstract

Author Manuscript

Lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs) are frequently mutated or overexpressed in cancer
and contribute toward malignant behaviors, but the molecular bases of their oncogenic properties
are largely unknown. Because TF activities are difficult to inhibit directly with small molecules,
the genes and pathways they regulate might represent more tractable targets for drug therapy. We
studied GATA6, a TF gene that is frequently amplified or overexpressed in gastric, esophageal,
and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. GATA6-overexpressing gastric cancer cell lines cluster in gene
expression space, separate from non-overexpressing lines. This expression clustering signifies a
shared pathogenic group of genes that GATA6 may regulate through direct cis-element binding.
We used chromatin immunoprecipation and sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify GATA6-bound
genes and considered TF occupancy in relation to genes that respond to GATA6 depletion in cell
lines and track with GATA6 mRNA (synexpression groups) in primary gastric cancers. Among
other cellular functions, GATA6-occupied genes control apoptosis and govern M-phase of the cell
cycle. Depletion of GATA6 reduced levels of the latter transcripts and arrested cells in G2 and M
phases of the cell cycle. Synexpression in human tumor samples identified likely direct
transcriptional targets substantially better than consideration only of transcripts that respond to
GATA6 loss in cultured cells. Candidate target genes responded to loss of GATA6 or its homolog
GATA4 and even more to depletion of both proteins. Many GATA6-dependent genes lacked

nearby binding sites but several strongly dependent, synexpressed, and GATA6-bound genes
encode TFs such as MYC, HES1, RARB, and CDX2. Thus, many downstream effects occur
indirectly through other TFs and GATA6 activity in gastric cancer is partially redundant with
GATA4. This integrative analysis of locus occupancy, gene dependency, and synexpression
provides a functional signature of GATA6-overexpressing gastric cancers, revealing both limits
and new therapeutic directions for a challenging and frequently fatal disease.

INTRODUCTION
Some lineage-restricted transcription factors (TFs) specify developing tissues and regulate
cell-specific genes in adults. Cancers often amplify such TF genes, including MITF in
melanoma (1), NKX2-1 in lung adenocarcinoma (2), SOX2 in squamous esophageal cancer
(3), and AR in prostate cancer (4). As tumors may depend on amplified TF genes (2, 3), they
are potential targets for cancer therapy. However, TFs other than nuclear hormone receptors
are notoriously difficult drug targets (5, 6). Therefore, core downstream genes and pathways
might suggest alternative targets that are more sensitive to small molecules. GATA4 and
GATA6 are amplified in up to 30% of gastric and esophageal adenocarcinomas (7) and
GATA6 depletion in the latter specifically impairs anchorage-independent cell growth (8, 9).
We studied the dependencies and transcriptional functions of this TF.

Worldwide, stomach cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death (10, 11). Somatic
copy number amplifications (SCNAs) or mutations of ERBB2, EGFR, MET, and FGFR2
offer avenues for targeted therapy in few patients (12–14). Esophageal adenocarcinomas,
which are closely related, frequently amplify GATA6 and GATA4 (7), TF gene loci that
show especially high expression in gastric and duodenal epithelia (15, 16). In mouse
intestine, GATA6 levels are highest in the crypts, where cell proliferation is reduced in
conditional Gata6−/− mice (17). TF co-occupancy, determined by chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP), further suggests that GATA6 mediates crypt functions together
with CDX2, a master intestinal regulator (18). Because gastric cancer frequently arises in a
background of intestinal metaplasia (19), this partnership suggests that GATA gene
amplifications may promote proliferative, crypt progenitor-like properties in stomach
epithelial cells.

Author Manuscript

GATA6 is also amplified in pancreas cancer (20, 21), but interference with its functions is
hampered by limited information about the targets of transcriptional control. To delineate
core downstream genes, pathways, and functions in gastric cancer, we examined genomewide GATA6 occupancy in relation to GATA6-dependent gene expression in cell lines and
GATA6-associated gene expression (synexpression) in human tumor samples. This
approach revealed features, consequences and core transcriptional targets of GATA6 in
gastric cancer.

RESULTS
Amplification and expression of GATA genes in upper digestive tract cancers

Author Manuscript

Small regions on chromosomes 8p and 18q are focally amplified in 17% to 22% of stomach
and gastro-esophageal junction (G-EJ) adenocarcinomas (7). GISTIC analysis (22) of these
cases and public SCNA data from 321 additional primary stomach cancers identified GATA6
and GATA4 as the only genes within the minimal common areas of amplification (Fig. 1A).
Among hundreds of diverse cancers, high-level GATA4 amplifications were largely confined
to gastric cancer and GATA6 amplifications to stomach and pancreas adenocarcinomas
(Suppl. Fig. S1A). GATA4 and GATA6 are homologous TFs that recognize the same DNA
sequence and have overlapping functions in some mouse tissues (23, 24), suggesting that
they may serve similar roles in gastric cancer. Because GATA6 amplifications are more
common and GATA6 antibodies (Ab) perform well in tissue and chromatin studies, we
concentrated on this TF.

Author Manuscript

GATA6 is expressed in normal human stomach epithelium, intestinal metaplasia, and
carcinoma (Fig. 1B, Suppl. Fig. S1B). Both GATA6-amplified and unamplified gastric
cancers showed strong immunostaining in most tumor cells (Suppl. Fig. S1C), consistently
stronger than in colorectal cancer (CRC, Fig. 1B, Suppl. Fig. S1B), where GATA6
amplification is uncommon (Suppl. Fig. S1A). Many gastric cancers also express the
intestine-restricted factor CDX2, consistent with their likely origin in areas of intestinal
metaplasia (19), but GATA6 levels showed no association with CDX2 expression or tumor
cell differentiation (Suppl. Fig. S1C). mRNA analysis of 290 gastric cancers in The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/tcga/) showed high GATA6 expression
in a significant fraction of cases and GATA4 overexpression in fewer cases (Fig. 1C).
Tumors with high GATA6 amplification showed significantly higher mRNA levels than
diploid samples and GATA6 mRNA or protein (Suppl. Fig. S1C) were rarely lost. In
summary, GATA6 amplification is common in gastric cancers and elevates expression,
although tumors lacking amplification also may overexpress GATA6.
Expression of GATA6 and possible downstream genes in gastric cancer cell lines

Author Manuscript

Focal GATA gene amplifications were uncommon in gastric cancer cell lines (Suppl. Figs.
S1A, S2A). Only 2 of 26 lines, HUG1N and GC1Y, showed GATA6, and none showed
GATA4, amplification (Suppl. Fig. S2B). Protein expression among 9 gastric cancer lines
was highest in HUG1N, at levels similar to those found in the CRC cell line Caco-2 (Fig.
2A). Immunoblotting detected no GATA6 in GC1Y cells and two lines lacking
amplification, AGS and SNU16, expressed almost the same GATA6 levels as HUG1N.
Thus, gene amplification does not invariably produce excess protein and is only one basis
for overexpression. Indeed, despite the paucity of SCNAs at chromosome 18p, gastric
cancer cell lines commonly express abundant GATA6 mRNA, and hierarchical clustering of
gene expression similarities (Euclidean distance, 1000 most variant probe sets) across 36
lines revealed GATA-overexpressing lines as a distinct sub-class (Fig. 2B). The 15 cell lines
in this group included all GATA6-expressing lines we detected by immunoblotting: AGS,
HUG1N, NCI-N87, and SNU-16. GATA4 mRNA was overexpressed in fewer lines, many of
which showed high GATA6. The presence of a characteristic mRNA profile in GATA6-

overexpressing gastric cancers suggests that some of these genes represent its transcriptional
targets. We chose HUG1N and AGS cells to study GATA6 functions because these lines
express more GATA6 than GATA4 (Fig. 2A) and HUG1N, in particular, carries multiple
gene copies.
Effects of GATA6 depletion on cell replication and gene expression

Author Manuscript

Using lentivirus-delivered shRNAs to deplete GATA6, we confirmed that cells selected for
viral integration were efficiently depleted compared to those receiving a control shRNA
(Fig. 3A). AGS, SNU16, and Caco2 cells all proliferated slower after GATA6 depletion
(Fig. 3A). Proliferation of HUG1N was unaffected by short-term depletion (≤6 cell
doublings), suggesting possible adaptation in culture to escape dependency. By contrast, in a
pooled-shRNA screen of 89 cancer cell lines (25), GATA6 dependency was strongly
correlated with its expression level: over ≥16 cell doublings, HUG1N and other high
GATA6-expressing gastric and CRC cell lines were among the most susceptible to GATA6
depletion (box #3 in Fig. 3B). Moreover, transcripts affected by GATA6 depletion in
HUG1N and Caco2 cells were significantly correlated with GATA6-synexpressed mRNAs in
primary tumors and cell lines (Fig. 3C). Thus, transcripts that respond to GATA6 deficiency
closely match in vivo gene expression and are likely enriched for bona fide target genes.
Transcripts altered in GATA6-deficient HUG1N cells were correlated significantly with
synexpressed genes in CRC and even better with synexpressed genes in gastric cell lines and
tumors (Fig. 3C), suggesting that GATA6 may control some genes specifically in the
stomach or colon and other genes in both organs.

Author Manuscript

Compared to cells treated with a control shRNA, 805 transcripts dropped in levels in
GATA6-deficient HUG1N cells and 595 transcripts were increased. Like its homolog
GATA1 (26, 27), GATA6 may both activate and repress genes directly or one function
could be direct and the other indirect. A non-parametric test of all log2 fold-changes in
transcript levels in GATA6-depleted HUG1N cells revealed that mean changes were
significantly enriched for reduced expression (one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, P=2 ×
10−8), suggesting that in unperturbed cells GATA6 activates many more genes than it might
repress. In line with this idea, no functional Gene Ontology category was enriched among
595 transcripts that increased in HUG1N cells or 144 transcripts that increased in both
Caco2 and HUG1N. In contrast, functional categories were readily apparent among
transcripts that declined upon GATA6 loss (Suppl. Fig. S3A and B), providing clues to its
cellular functions.

Author Manuscript

The 212 transcripts reduced in both Caco2 and HUG1N cells depleted of GATA6 represent
a highly significant, non-random overlap (Fig. 4A; odds ratio 9.0, p<4 × 10−103 by Fisher
exact test) and were enriched for Gene Ontology terms related to the cell cycle, particularly
M-phase (Fig. 4B). GATA6 knockdown in Caco2, AGS and SNU16 cells resulted in smaller
G1- and S-phase fractions and higher G2/M-phase fractions than control shRNA-treated
cells, indicating M-phase dysfunction (Fig. 4C). Phospho-histone H3 immunofluorescence
and immunoblot analyses verified this G2/M-phase arrest (Figs. 4D–E). Although the cell
cycle seemed overtly undisturbed in HUG1N cells, qRT-PCR analysis showed reduced M-

phase related transcripts in GATA6-depleted cell lines, including HUG1N (Fig. 4F). These
data implicate late cell cycle control as a core GATA6 function.
Delineation of GATA6 cistromes

Author Manuscript

To identify primary transcriptional targets, we used ChIP-seq to localize GATA6 binding in
HUG1N cells. After adjusting for results from mock IgG ChIP, we mapped nearly 7,000
high-confidence GATA6 binding sites in HUG1N cells and considered the data together
with occupancy previously mapped in Caco2 cells (18). High sequence conservation within
ChIP fragments and greatest enrichment for the consensus WGATAA motif, present in at
least 70% of bound regions, implied direct occupancy at most sites (Fig. 5A). Although
GATA6 occupied many regions within 3 kb of transcriptional start sites (TSSs), it
predominantly bound DNA far from promoters (Fig. 5A). For example, binding near
FGFR2, which is implicated and occasionally amplified in gastric cancer (28, 29), occurs 8
kb and 13 kb from the promoter (Fig. 5B). Moreover, GATA6 sometimes occupied exactly
the same sites in HUG1N and Caco2 cells (e.g., ANKRD30BL locus, Fig. 5C) or different
sites near the same locus (e.g., FGFR2, Fig. 5B), but often bound sites in only 1 of the 2 cell
lines (Fig. 5D). Binding unique to each line did not trivially reflect deletion of the
corresponding genomic region in the other. To determine if these differences reflect tissuespecific binding in the stomach and colon, we mapped GATA6 occupancy in overexpressing
AGS gastric cancer cells and observed modest overlap among the 3 cell lines (Fig. 5E). Sites
confined to 1 or 2 lines seemed not to reflect technical artifacts in the others but bona fide
absence of GATA6 at those regions (Figs. 5B,D,E). In aggregate, ChIP-seq revealed diverse
GATA6 binding to cellular DNA, with cell line-specific, tissue-specific, and shared binding
sites. We reasoned that common binding sites and transcriptional targets might represent the
most pertinent outcome of frequent gene amplification.

GATA6-dependent genes, synexpression, and DNA occupancy together impute target
genes

To determine roles of GATA6 binding in gene regulation, we measured concordance of
fold-changes in gene expression in GATA6-deficient HUG1N cells with its occupancy near
affected genes. Fig. 6A plots the Pearson correlations between binding sites and genes
affected by GATA6 depletion; negative correlations denote higher concordance. Altered
gene expression in HUG1N cells correlated with GATA6 binding in HUG1N cells better
than binding in Caco2 cells, and ChIP-seq in AGS gastric cancer cells did not improve this
correlation. Fig. 6B shows heat maps of ordered average fold-changes per gene, from most
repressed (left, blue) to most activated (right, red), and the corresponding average GATA6
binding near those genes (<20 kb, brighter yellow denotes higher occupancy). GATA6
binding in HUG1N cells alone (Fig. 6B) or in both HUG1N and AGS cells (data not shown)
correlated with altered gene expression. To identify direct transcriptional targets, we first
considered genes that bind GATA6 within 20 kb of the TSS and also reduce expression in
GATA6-depleted cells. Gene Ontology analysis of such genes in HUG1N (Suppl. Fig. S3C)
suggests that GATA6 directly regulates 75 genes that control cell replication; 41 of these
genes promote cell proliferation, and GATA6 also binds DNA near dependent genes
implicated in cell death. Among genes that bind GATA6 and depend on it in Caco2 cells, 86
genes regulate cell proliferation (Suppl. Fig. S3D). “Digestion” and “Response to hormone

stimulus”, functions strongly linked to gastrointestinal physiology, were also highly
enriched among genes near GATA6-binding sites in HUG1N and Caco2 cells, respectively,
suggesting a breadth of cellular roles.

Author Manuscript

Reasoning that bona fide transcriptional targets might additionally co-express with GATA6
RNA in human cancer tissues, we integrated these cell line data with information on
synexpressed genes, i.e., correlation scores for every gene’s expression with GATA6
expression. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) (30) to determine directions of
maximal variation in the combined space of altered gene expression in GATA6-deficient
HUG1N and Caco2 cells (axes 1 and 2) and GATA6 synexpression across 4 large datasets of
colon and gastric cancer tissues and cell lines (axes 3–6); the first 2 PCA axes accounted for
53% of the variation. A linear combination of normalized PCA scores for each gene,
incorporating cell line and tumor sample data, yielded a ranked list of candidate GATA6
transcriptional targets (Suppl. Table 1). This integrated PCA ranking (Fig. 6C) gave far
stronger concordance with individual binding sites than did GATA6-dependent gene
expression in cell lines (Fig. 6A). HUG1N binding showed the highest concordance, but
GATA6 occupancy in Caco2 and AGS cells also was significantly correlated. PCA ranking
(Fig. 6D) also performed significantly better than GATA6-dependent gene expression (Fig.
6B) at assigning probable regulatory functions to GATA6 binding sites.

Author Manuscript

We compared the genes best correlated in PCA analysis (using z <−4 as a stringent measure;
Fig. 6E shows the 20 highest scoring genes) with the most anti-correlated genes (z >+4,
Suppl. Table 1). Among the 109 genes highly associated with GATA6 in expression space,
11 genes showed GATA6 occupancy within 20 kb of the TSS in all 3 cell lines (shaded
yellow in Suppl. Table 1) and 31 genes bound GATA6 in 2 or more lines (highlighted in
Figs. 6E and 6G, shaded green in Suppl. Table 1). Thus, within a reasonable distance for TF
regulation of nearby genes (31, 32) the data reveal a high likelihood that GATA6 activates
synexpressed genes. If GATA6 also represses transcription, we might expect to detect its
binding near the 97 genes most anti-correlated with GATA6 expression (z>+4). However,
none of these genes showed nearby GATA6 binding in all 3 lines (P=9e−4, Fisher exact test)
and only 1 gene bound GATA6 in 2 cell lines (P=6.5e−9, Fig. 6F). The disparity in GATA6
binding near genes that are synexpressed and those that are anti-correlated in expression
persisted for weaker associations (z <−3 or >+3, Fig. 6F, Suppl. Table 1). Together, these
data argue for a predominantly activating function for GATA6. Moreover, as most GATA6dependent, co-expressed genes do not bind GATA6 within 20 kb of the promoter, they may
represent mainly indirect transcriptional targets.
Integrative analysis of GATA6 occupancy, gene dependencies, and tumor synexpression

Author Manuscript

At least 30% of GATA6-bound regions detected in only 1 cell line lacked canonical GATA
motifs and may therefore represent indirect binding or spurious signals. By contrast, all of
the hundreds of sites common to 2 or 3 cell lines carried a consensus GATA motif. Thus,
shared sites reflect occupancy best, and although HUG1N and Caco2 cells shared only a
fraction of binding sites (Fig. 5E), these might denote authentic, common target genes.
Genes that control hormonal responses, cell proliferation, and lipid metabolism were
significantly enriched near such shared binding sites (Fig. 7A). Indeed, 18 genes associated

with cell proliferation showed similar GATA6 dependency and GATA6 binding in both cell
lines (e.g., HES1 promoter, Fig. 7A). Eight of these likely bona fide GATA6 transcriptional
targets encode TFs.

Author Manuscript

To identify targets most relevant to gastric cancer, we captured genes with high PCA rank
and nearby GATA6 binding in HUG1N and AGS cells, irrespective of occupancy in Caco2
(Fig. 7B). Target genes determined by integrative analysis of expression and GATA6
binding encode diverse transcriptional, secretory, survival, cytoskeletal and metabolic
factors, and as such, fail to deliver a unifying view of GATA6 function. Because binding in
gastric cancer cells generally matched that in CRC cells (yellow shading in Fig. 7B,
illustrated in Fig. 7D; see Venn diagram in Fig. 5E), we considered 733 sites present in all 3
cell lines, noting that 49 of the sites lie within 20 kb of genes that depend on GATA6 in both
Caco2 and HUG1N cells. The Gene Ontology biological process associated with the highest
statistical significance was Regulation of Transcription (Fig. 7C), as represented by TF
genes CDX2, CEBPG, HES1, IRF8, LRRFIP1, MLXIPL, MYC, NR5A2, and RARB. All 9 of
these transcripts were reduced in GATA6-depleted AGS, HUG1N, and Caco2 cells (Fig.
7D) and GATA6 bound the same sites in each cell line (e.g., 8 kb upstream of CEBPG, Fig.
7E). Five of these 9 TF genes showed very little expression in gastric cancer cell lines that
lack both GATA6 and GATA4 (Suppl. Fig. S3E), and 4 of them fell within the highest
percentile of PCA ranks, with z-scores <−3.36 (Fig. 7D). These data reveal a strong
correlation with GATA6 in expression space. Other TFs (NR0B2, MYCN, KLF5) also were
strongly correlated in expression but bound GATA6 in 1 or 2 cell lines, and the gene with
the highest PCA rank, FOXE1 (z=−23), also encodes a TF. Identification of these candidate
target genes might explain indirect GATA6 effects on gene regulation and suggests that it
governs many genes through these TFs.

Author Manuscript

Functional redundancy among GATA factors

Author Manuscript

Because GATA6 and GATA4 recognizes the same DNA sequence, are often co-expressed,
and have overlapping functions in some tissues (23, 24), we asked next if the two
homologous TFs might share transcriptional targets in human gastric cancer. Lentiviral
delivery of specific shRNAs depleted GATA4 efficiently in AGS and HUG1N gastric
cancer cells (Fig. 8A), which we selected because they express both proteins (Fig. 2A). The
same representative cell-cycle and TF genes that respond to GATA6 deficiency and bind
GATA6 showed significantly reduced levels in GATA4-depleted cells (Fig. 8B). To test if
the two factors are truly redundant, we examined expression of the same genes following
shRNA-mediated depletion of GATA4, GATA6, or both in HUG1N cells. Some target
genes showed similar effects upon loss of one or both TFs, but most transcripts showed at
least an additive effect (Fig. 8C). The heightened sensitivity to dual TF depletion indicates
that both GATA4 and GATA6 contribute toward regulation of a wide array of gastric cancer
genes (Fig. 8D).

DISCUSSION
GATA4 and GATA6 regulate diverse digestive epithelia (17, 23, 33, 34). Their genes are
amplified in a high fraction of gastric and G-EJ adenocarcinomas and frequently

overexpressed, even in the absence of gene amplification, and GATA6 is also amplified in
pancreatic cancer, a related neoplasm (20, 21). Cell replication and colony assays suggest
GATA6 dependence in esophageal and pancreas cancers (8, 9, 21) but the transcriptional
basis of this dependence is unknown. Among 39 gastric cancer cell lines, GATA6
overexpression delineates a disease subset that expresses many genes in common, likely
reflecting GATA6 regulatory functions. Genome-wide GATA6 occupancy, considered in
relation to GATA6-dependent gene expression, provided one layer of insight into target
genes. Transcripts that increased in GATA6-depleted cells, possibly owing to relief of
GATA6-mediated repression, rarely showed GATA6 occupancy higher than the genome
background. In contrast, genes with reduced expression in GATA6-deficient cells were
enriched for nearby GATA6 binding and for functions related to cell cycle M-phase control,
digestion, metabolism, and hormonal responses. Thus, in gastrointestinal cells, GATA6
coordinately activates genes of related function, with perhaps little direct transcriptional
repression, distinct from its homolog GATA1, which activates and represses genes in blood
cells (27). There is no obvious mechanism for this apparent difference, other than the
transcriptional contexts in epithelial and blood cells.

Author Manuscript

Our consideration of gene synexpression across primary gastric and colorectal cancers
significantly improved imputation of likely direct targets and functions. Most GATA6dependent, synexpressed genes, however, lack GATA6 occupancy within 20 kb or more,
implying indirect regulation through other TFs. Sequence-specific TFs that may fulfill this
role are readily found among transcriptional targets that bind GATA6 in multiple cell lines
and show extreme associations in expression space: CEBPG, IRF8, HES1, NR5A2 and
CDX2; we propose that these TFs execute many cellular functions downstream of GATA6
(Fig. 8D). As TFs generally make poor drug targets, our observations have implications for
the selective treatment of GATA6-overexpressing gastric cancers. Suitable targets for new
drugs might include enzymes that modify components of this TF network or nuclear
hormone receptors such as NR5A2.

Author Manuscript

GATA6 overexpression begins early in esophageal neoplasia (8) and the spectrum of
transcriptional targets we identify supports early biologic effects. Control of M-phase genes
and arrest of GATA6-depleted cells late in the cell cycle, for example, may explain
accelerated cell replication. Target genes include CDX2, a TF that controls intestinal
differentiation (35, 36) and partners with GATA6 to regulate intestinal cell growth (18).
Presence of both CDX2 and GATA6 in many gastric cancers reflects the prevalence of
intestinal differentiation in this disease (37) and their partnership may promote tissuespecific proliferation. Among other intestinal gene targets (e.g., FABP1, SPINK4, GCNT1,
VILL), LGR5 in particular marks intestinal (38) and some gastric (39) stem cells. At least
two TF target genes, MYC and NR5A2, are components of self-renewal and pluripotency
networks (40) and we implicate GATA6 in regulating HES1, a transcriptional target of
Notch signals (41). GATA6 activity at the HES1 promoter is noteworthy because Notch
signaling plays an important role in mouse stomach epithelial stem and progenitor cell
activity (42) and because HES1 and other GATA factors regulate each other’s expression in
other tissues (43, 44). Thus, GATA6 targets in gastric cancer place its activity within
pathways for cell replication and self-renewal, differentiation, and transcriptional control.

Epigenetic and signaling determinants of the GATA6 cistrome in each tissue and tumor are
likely complex. Although mutations and other features may influence TF binding, we reason
that a shared transcriptional program mediates GATA6-dependent oncogenic functions. We
propose a core set of target genes that GATA6 occupies in multiple cell lines and that
associate tightly with GATA6 expression in primary gastric cancers. The homologous
protein GATA4 seems to regulate the same target genes redundantly with GATA6.

RNA and protein expression

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen), treated with the RNeasy Mini Kit
(Qiagen), and DNA was removed using Turbo DNA Free (Ambion). For qRT-PCR analysis,
2 μg of total RNA was reverse transcribed with Superscript III First Strand Synthesis System
(Invitrogen) and cDNA was amplified using SYBRGreen PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). For transcript profiling, 1 μg of total RNA was processed for hybridization to
U133A 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays for human genes (Affymetrix). To prepare nuclear
lysates, cells were suspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM
KCl), followed by nuclear lysis buffer (20mM Tris pH 7.9, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 0.42M NaCl,
0.2 mM EDTA) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Whole-cell extracts
were prepared in parallel to assess equal inputs for immunoblotting. Proteins resolved by

SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and probed with GATA6 (Cell
Signaling, # 4253), GATA4 (Millipore, # AB4132), and Actin (Santa Cruz, # 47778)
antibodies (Ab). Binding was detected by chemiluminescence after incubation with
horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary Ab (Santa Cruz, # 2048). Immunohistochemistry
was performed as described previously (46) using CDX2 (Biogenex, # 10M MU392A-UC)
and GATA6 Ab.
GATA6 and GATA4 knock-down, proliferation, and cell cycle analyses

Author Manuscript

Cells were infected with lentiviruses in the pLKO.1 vector (Open Biosystems) carrying
GATA6 (5′-AGAACAGCGAGCTCAAGTATT-3′), GATA4 (5′CCAGAGATTCTGCAACACGAA-3′), or a control shRNA not complementary to any
human gene and known to lack cytotoxicity (NS, 5′-CCTAAGGTTAAGTCGCCCTCG-3′).
Stable clones were selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin and GATA6 or GATA4 depletion
assessed 10 days later by immunoblotting. Triplicate samples of 5,000 cells maintained in
puromycin-free medium for 48h were seeded in 96-well plates and proliferation was
assessed using CellTiter 96 (Promega G4000) at 570 nm absorbance using a Synergy-2
multi-detection plate reader (BioTek). For cell cycle analysis, cells were fixed in 70%
ethanol, incubated overnight at −20°C, washed in PBS, stained with 10 μg/ml propidium
iodide for 30 min, and analyzed on a FACScan instrument (Becton-Dickinson) at 488 nm.
Phospho-histone H3 (PH3) analyses

Author Manuscript

Histones were extracted as described (47), with substitution of 0.2 N HCl for 0.4 N H2SO4,
neutralized with 3 volumes of Trizma base (pH 11), resolved by SDS-PAGE, and
immunoblotted as described above with Histone H3 (Cell Signaling, cat. #9715) and PH3
(Cell Signaling, 3377) Ab. shRNA-treated AGS cells were also seeded on glass cover slips,
fixed, incubated sequentially with PH3 Ab and FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG
(Jackson Immunoresearch, 111-096-144), and mounted in medium containing DAPI
(Vectashield, H-1200).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-seq
ChIP and ChIP-seq were performed as described previously (18), using 3 μg GATA6 Ab
(Cell Signaling 4253S). We used Cistrome tools (www.cistrome.org/) to call and annotate
peaks, generate wiggle files and conservation plots, identify enriched sequence motifs and
linked genes, and compare data across ChIP-seq libraries (48). Wiggle traces were generated
using the Integrative Genome Viewer (IGV) (49).
Data analysis

Author Manuscript

Integrative expression analysis was performed in the R statistical computing environment
(http://cran.r-project.org). Hierarchical clustering of the 1,000 most varying probesets in
mRNA expression across gastric cancer cell lines was generated with a Euclidean distance
metric and complete linkage clustering. A distinct cluster containing the HUG1N and AGS
cell lines corresponded to those that express high levels of GATA6 (probeset 210002_at) and
GATA4 (probeset 205517_at) mRNAs, independent of presence of GATA4 or GATA6
probesets in the distance matrix calculation. Functional categories enriched among groups of

genes were determined using DAVID software (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the following 6 dimensions of measurements
across all genes: average fold-changes in gene expression in Caco2 and HUG1N cells
following shRA-mediated GATA6 depletion (measured by dChip, http://
biosun1.harvard.edu/complab/dchip), and Pearson correlations of GATA6 mRNA levels with
all mRNAs in primary stomach and colorectal cancers and cell lines. Fold-changes (FC) in
transcript levels have a positive or negative sign to denote increases or decreases; for PCA
analysis we centered fold-change values at 0 by the transformation FC -> sign(FC) (abs(FC)
- 1.0). PCA axes are ordered by decreasing amount of variance explained in the 6dimensional space (30) and the first 2 principal axes were used to derive scores for each
gene, by projection. PCA scores for each axis were converted into z-scores and added to
yield a single ranking that integrated shRNA and synexpression data.

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

A) Summary of SCNA data from SNP array analysis in studies to date: Dulak et al. (7),
GSE31168 in the Gene Expression Omnibus, and stomach adenocarcinoma STAD in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Results of GISTIC analysis are represented by chromosome
and show that the minimal common regions of amplification on chromosomes 8p and 18q
encompass the single gene loci GATA4 and GATA6, respectively. Also see Suppl. Fig. S1A.
B) Representative immunohistochemical analysis of GATA6 and CDX2 in human tissue,
showing abundance of both proteins in a gastric cancer with GATA6 amplification. GATA6
is expressed in normal stomach epithelium and often increased in cancer, whereas CDX2 is
expressed only in intestinal metaplasia and cancer; additional examples appear in Suppl. Fig.
S1B. The right panels display GATA6 and CDX2 expression in CRC. Original
magnification 10X, inserts show 6X additional digital magnification. C) Collated GATA
gene expression from RNA-seq data in the TCGA_stomach adenocarcinoma database,
showing GATA6 overexpression in a significant fraction of cases and that, although GATA4
mRNA loss is common, primary tumors rarely lose GATA6 expression. Color scales
interpret the degree of GATA factor mRNA overexpression.

Figure 2. GATA factor expression and synexpression in gastric cancer cell lines

Author Manuscript

A) Immunoblot analysis of GATA6 and GATA4 in Caco2 CRC cells and 9 gastric cancer
lines chosen for presence (HUG1N, GC1Y) or absence of GATA6 gene amplification. B)
Hierarchical clustering of mRNA expression in 36 gastric cancer cell lines, based on the
1000 probe sets that vary the most across this cell line collection (variance calculated by
Euclidean distance). Bars with a red-blue scale represent relative expression levels of
GATA6 (vertical bar) and GATA4 (horizontal bar) mRNAs in each cell line. This analysis
revealed 2 distinct tumor classes. One class encompasses GATA6 (and/or GATA4) mRNAoverexpressing cell lines (bottom left), including all GATA6-expressing lines from the
immunoblot analysis (A, which are highlighted by asterisks). Gene expression in these 17
cell lines clusters separately from all others, revealing that GATA factors associate
specifically with a sizable body of genes and putative transcriptional targets in gastric
cancer. The data also indicate that GATA6 is often (but not always) highly expressed, even
without gene amplification.

Figure 3. Loss of GATA6 impairs growth and affects gene expression in gastrointestinal cancer
cells

Author Manuscript

A) GATA6-overexpressing cell lines were infected with lentiviral vectors carrying GATA6specific or a non-specific (NS) 21-bp shRNA, selected in puromycin for viral integration,
and assessed daily in triplicate for cell viability using MTT assays. Immunoblots verified
efficient GATA6 depletion in all cell lines for each replicate, using actin as a loading
control, and each plotted value represents the mean (±SD) optical density. B) Correlation of
GATA6 expression levels with GATA6 dependency in an unbiased, pooled-shRNA screen
of >11,000 genes in human cancer cell lines (Ref. 25). 89 cell lines were grouped into 4 bins
according to the relative level of GATA6 mRNA, 0=absence, 3=high. Relative response in
growth of these lines to GATA6 shRNA is shown in box plots with the centers indicating
median sensitivity, edges at the 25th and 75th percentiles, and whiskers extending to the
extreme non-outlier data points. Red and blue dots represent HUG1N and AGS,
respectively, and many high-expressing, shRNA-sensitive cell lines were from CRCs. C)
Concordance of GATA6 expression correlations in primary tumors and cell lines and
transcripts differentially expressed in GATA6-deficient cells. Pearson correlations with
GATA6 expression were computed from primary tumor (125 stomach, 1,732 CRC) and cell
line (36 gastric, 59 CRC) datasets. Correlation coefficients for every gene were then
correlated with fold-changes (Δ exp) from shRNA experiments in HUG1N and Caco2 cells.
The resulting Pearson correlations are displayed in a heat map, with zeroing of the diagonal.
Asterisks denote significant concordance based on a t-test and P <0.001.

Figure 6. Identification of GATA6 target genes from analysis of DNA binding and effects on gene
expression

Author Manuscript

A) Pearson correlation coefficients of GATA6 binding (ChIP-seq data) and genes affected
by GATA6 depletion (microarray analysis following shRNA treatment). GATA6 binding
was encoded as 0 or 1; negative correlations denote higher concordance. B) Top: heat map
of sorted transcript fold-changes after GATA6 depletion, averaged over bins of 500 genes
and ordered from most reduced (left, blue) to most increased (right, red). Bottom: heat map
of average GATA6 occupancy within 20 kb of the corresponding 500-gene bins. C) Pearson
correlation coefficients of nearby GATA6 binding and the PCA ranks of genes based on
reduced expression in GATA6-deficient cells and synexpression in human cancer specimens
and cell lines; negative correlations denote higher concordance. D) Top: heat map of
combined PCA ranking score, averaged over windows of 500 genes and ordered from best
correlated (left, blue, high negative z-scores) to the least correlated (right, red, high positive
z-scores). Bottom: heat map of GATA6 occupancy within 20 kb of the corresponding bins
of 500 PCA-ranked genes. E) The 20 best-scoring genes by PCA rank, extracted from
Suppl. Table S1; genes showing nearby GATA6 binding in at least 2 cell lines are
highlighted. F) GATA6 occupancy in cell lines within 20 kb of the TSS of PCA-ranked
gene groups. G) Representative wiggle trace showing GATA6 occupancy at the SPINK4
locus, representing a high-ranking gene from panel E.

A) Biological process Gene Ontology (GO) terms enriched among genes that bind GATA6
and require it for expression in both HUG1N and Caco2 cells. A Venn diagram illustrates
the 18-gene overlap between 2 cell lines of GATA6-regulated and GATA6-occupied genes
associated with cell proliferation and a representative data trace shows GATA6 binding at
the HES1 promoter. B) Genes with a significant z-score in Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) and nearby GATA6 occupancy in gastric cell lines. Yellow shading marks genes that
also bind GATA6 in Caco2 CRC cells. C) Transcripts ascribed to the GO term
“Transcriptional regulation” represent the most enriched category of genes with common
GATA6 binding sites and levels that respond to GATA6 depletion in AGS, HUG1N and
Caco2 cells. D) qRT-PCR for these 9 TF genes confirmed reduced expression in HUG1N
and Caco2, and showed similarly reduced levels in GATA6-depleted AGS gastric cancer
cells. Values represent the average fold-change ±SD in 3 independent experiments. PCA
rank and z-score for each gene are listed, and genes showing extreme association with
GATA6 in expression space are marked in bold. E) GATA6 occupancy at one of these 9 TF
loci, CEPBG.

Figure 8. Additive and redundant effects of GATA6 and GATA4

Author Manuscript

A) Immunoblot evidence that GATA4 shRNA depletes GATA4 but not GATA6 protein in
AGS (top) and HUG1N (bottom) gastric cancer cells. The lanes represent triplicate samples
from 1 of 3 experiments. B) qRT-PCR analysis showing GATA4 dependency of most
GATA6 target genes in HUG1N and AGS cells. GATA4 shRNA reduced GATA4 mRNA
levels 17- (AGS) to 19- (HUG1N) fold and relative levels of candidate cell-cycle (green
labels) and TF (brown labels) target transcripts of GATA regulation are shown from 3
independent replicates. C) qRT-PCR in HUG1N cells, showing that most target genes
respond to GATA4 or GATA6 deficiency and more significantly to loss of both, revealing

redundant activities. shRNAs reduced GATA6 and GATA4 mRNA levels about 30-fold and
relative mRNA levels of target genes were measured in 3 replicates. D) Model for GATA
function in gastric cancer. GATA6, in partial redundancy with GATA4, controls diverse
genes, including those involved in cell differentiation and late phases of the cell cycle.
Although some genes are direct transcriptional targets, others are controlled indirectly
through GATA-factor regulation of intermediary TF genes, such as CDX2, HES1, and
NR5A2.
