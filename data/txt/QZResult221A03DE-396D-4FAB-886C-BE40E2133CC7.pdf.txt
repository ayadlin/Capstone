Abstract

Author Manuscript

Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the U.S., while DNA-damaging UVB radiation from
the sun remains the major environmental risk factor. Reducing skin cancer incidence is becoming
an urgent issue. The energy-sensing enzyme 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a
key role in the regulation of cellular lipid and protein metabolism in response to stimuli such as
exercise and changes in fuel availability. However, the role AMPK in the response of skin cells to
UVB damage and in skin cancer prevention remains unknown. Here we show that AMPK
activation is reduced in human and mouse squamous cell carcinoma as compared with normal
skin, and by UVB irradiation, suggesting that AMPK is a tumor suppressor. At the molecular
level, AMPK deletion reduced the expression of the DNA repair protein xeroderma pigmentosum
C (XPC) and UVB-induced DNA repair. AMPK activation by its activators AICAR (5aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside) and metformin (N’,N’-dimethylbiguanide), the
most widely used anti-diabetic drug, increased the expression of XPC expression and UVBinduced DNA repair in mouse skin, normal human epidermal keratinocytes, and AMPK wild-type
cells but not in AMPK deficient cells, indicating an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Topical
treatment with AICAR and metformin not only delayed onset of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis
but also reduced tumor multiplicity. Furthermore, AMPK deletion increased ERK activation and
cell proliferation, while AICAR and metformin inhibited ERK activation and cell proliferation in
keratinocytes, mouse skin, AMPK wild-type and AMPK deficient cells, suggesting an AMPKindependent mechanism. Finally, in UVB-damaged tumor-bearing mice, both topical and systemic
metformin prevented the formation of new tumors and suppressed growth of established tumors.
Our findings not only suggest that AMPK is a tumor suppressor in the skin by promoting DNA

Introduction

Author Manuscript

Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common type of cancer in the US, with
more than one million new cases of skin cancer being diagnosed each year, accounting for
40% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases. The number of NMSC continues to rise each year.
The major risk factor for NMSC is environmental UV radiation, in which UVB in sunlight is
the dominant skin carcinogen (1–3). UVB damages DNA, causes somatic mutations, and
thus disrupts genomic integrity.

Author Manuscript

The predominant DNA photoproducts caused by UVB radiation are
pyrimidine(6-4)pyrimidone dimers (6-4PP) and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) (4,
5). CPD are also a major source of DNA breaks (6) that cause genomic instability (7).
Replication of damaged DNA can cause mutations that may ultimately lead to skin
carcinogenesis (8–14). In response to DNA damage, the cells activate a specific DNA repair
mechanism, global genome nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), which involves wellcoordinated actions of DNA damage-binding proteins 1 and 2 (DDB1 and DDB2) and the
xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) proteins (XPA-G) (11, 12, 15–18). A deficiency in repairing
UV-induced DNA damage substantially accelerates skin cancer development, as seen in
xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients with genetic defects in the repair of UV-induced
DNA damage (11, 12).

Author Manuscript

The energy-sensing enzyme 5’-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in
the regulation of cellular lipid and protein metabolism in response to stimuli such as exercise
and changes in fuel availability, and is conserved among animals, plants, and fungi (19, 20).
AMPK is a heterotrimer that contains α-, β-, and γ-subunits, each of which has at least two
isoforms. Emerging evidence indicates that AMPK is a promising metabolic tumor
suppressor and a target for cancer prevention and therapy (21). The AMPK pathway
intersects with the oncogenic Ras/PI3K/mTOR and ERK pathways at multiple points in
growth control pathways (19). AMPK signaling also interacts with the p53 and ATM
pathways, two essential tumor suppressors and genomic gatekeepers, to coordinate
metabolic checkpoints and DNA damage response (22–24). As more functions and targets of
AMPK are decoded, the challenge will be in determining the role of AMPK activity in
malignancies and the precise interactions of AMPK with a specific organ and its
carcinogenic causes. These future findings will provide a fundamental basis for AMPK
activators as new agents and for strategies to better prevent and treat cancer.
There are two AMPK activators that have been explored for cancer treatment. One of them
is the most widely used anti-diabetic drug, metformin (N’,N’-dimethylbiguanide), which
belongs to the biguanide class of oral hypoglycemic agents. It is now prescribed to almost

120 million people worldwide and has become the first line anti-hyperglycemic agent in the
treatment of type 2 diabetes (25). Metformin works mainly by activating the AMPK
pathway and via an AMPK-independent mechanism (26, 27). Retrospective studies suggest
that diabetics treated with metformin have a substantially reduced cancer burden compared
with other diabetics. It is unclear whether this reflects a chemopreventive effect, and
whether these data have relevance to people without diabetes. Over the past few years,
however, impressive evidence from several studies indicates that metformin exhibits cancer
prevention effects in vitro and in animal models (28, 29). In addition, another AMPK
activator, AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside), has been shown to
suppress glioblastoma growth in vivo (30) and melanoma cell growth in vitro (31). AICAR
also inhibits keratinocyte growth in vitro (32). However, the role AMPK in the response of
skin cells to UVB and in skin cancer prevention remains unknown.

Author Manuscript

Here we have investigated the role of AMPK in UVB-induced DNA damage repair and cell
proliferation, two critical processes determining skin cancer susceptibility, and the impact of
AICAR and metformin on UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis and the role of AMPK
activation. We found that the activation of the energy-sensing enzyme 5’-AMP-activated
protein kinase (AMPK) was reduced in human and mouse squamous cell carcinomas as
compared with normal skin and by UVB damage. AMPK plays important roles in UVBinduced DNA damage repair and cell growth. Both AICAR and metformin reduced UVBinduced skin tumorigenesis. Furthermore, both topical and systemic metformin inhibited
growth of established tumors and prevented new tumor formation in mice with previous
UVB damage. At the molecular level, bothAMPK-dependent- and independent-mechanisms
are involved.

Results
AMPK pathway is inhibited in human and mouse skin tumors and in UVB-irradiated mouse
skin

Author Manuscript

To determine the role of the AMPK pathway in skin tumorigenesis, we analyzed the
activation of AMPK in human and mouse skin tumors and the regulation of AMPK by UVB
irradiation. As compared with normal human skin, human cutaneous squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC) showed reduced AMPK phosphorylation (Fig. 1A), implying that AMPK
is inhibited in human SCC. As compared with sham-irradiated mouse skin, phosphorylation
of ACC, a known AMPK target, was reduced not only in UVB-induced mouse tumors but
also in non-tumor mouse skin chronically irradiated by UVB (Fig. 1B), suggesting that
AMPK inactivation is an early event in UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis. In mouse skin,
UVB increased the phosphorylation of AMPK at 6 h, while it suppressed the
phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC at 24 h post-UVB, suggesting that, although UVB
activates AMPK at an earlier time point, it inhibits AMPK activation at a later time point
(Fig. 1C). ). It is possible that AMPK activation is followed by its down-regulation. These
findings suggest that AMPK acts as a tumor suppressor in UVB-induced skin cancer.

AMPK is required for enhancing UVB-induced DNA damage repair by AICAR and
metformin

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The ability of a keratinocyte to carry out proper DNA repair is vital to its genomic integrity
following UVB damage. Replication of damaged DNA can cause mutations that may
ultimately lead to skin carcinogenesis (8–14). To determine whether UVB-induced DNA
damage repair is affected by AMPK inhibition, AICAR, or metformin, we analyzed the
difference in DNA repair between AMPK wild-type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblast
(MEF) cells and AMPK knockout MEF cells, and between vehicle-treated (Veh) mouse skin
and AICAR- or metformin (Met)-treated skin and normal human epidermal keratinocytes
(NHEK). To determine the specific role of AMPK in UVB-induced DNA damage repair, we
elected to use conditions that neither caused apoptosis, which can remove damaged cells,
nor allowed cell proliferation, which will lead to overestimation of DNA repair due to
dilutions of DNA damage. We elected to use a low dose of UVB at 5 mJ/cm2 for MEF cells,
100 mJ/cm2 for mouse skin, and 20 mJ/cm2 for NHEK cells, which do not cause apoptosis
(data not shown). In addition, we used low serum medium (2%) for MEF cells or reduced
growth factors (20% of normal levels) for NHEK cells, together with functional checkpoint
pathway, to assure growth arrest after UVB radiation within 24 h for NHEK cells and mouse
skin, and 48 h for MEF cells (data not shown). In MEF cells, AMPK deletion significantly
reduced CPD repair (Fig. 2A-B; P < 0.05, Student’s t-test and two-way ANOVA), while it
had no effect on 6-4PP repair (Fig. 2A). These data indicate that AMPK is required for
efficient CPD repair and suggest that AMPK acts as a tumor suppressor, as failure to repair
CPD but not 6-4PP is the principal cause of skin cancer (9). In mouse skin, topical treatment
with AICAR or metformin accelerated CPD repair at 6 h post-UVB (Fig. 2C-D; P < 0.05,
Student’s t-test) significantly, while it did not affect either the repair of CPDs at 24 h or that
of 6-4PPs at 6 or 24 h post-UVB (Fig. 2E-F), indicating that the AMPK activators AICAR
and metformin promote CPD repair.

Author Manuscript

To further determine the role of AMPK activation in the action of AICAR and metformin,
we assessed whether AMPK deletion abolishes the promoting effect of AICAR and
metformin on CPD-repair. In AMPK WT MEF cells, AICAR (AI) and metformin
accelerated CPD repair at 6 h post-UVB, while they had no effect in AMPK KO MEF cells
(Fig. 2G), indicating that AMPK is required for promoting DNA repair by AICAR and
metformin. To determine the molecular mechanism by which AMPK regulates DNA repair,
we analyzed the difference in the protein levels of DDB1, DDB2, and XPC, crucial specific
factors required for repairing the majority of UVB-induced DNA damage (11, 12, 15–18).
AMPK deletion in MEF cells reduced the protein levels of XPC, while it had no effect on
DDB1 and DDB2 levels (Fig. 2H). However, AMPK deletion neither affected XPC
transcription (Fig. s1A) nor increased the nuclear localization of E2F4/p130 (Fig. s1B), the
repressor complex for XPC transcription, suggesting that AMPK regulates XPC expression
through a post-transcriptional mechanism. In normal epidermal human keratinocytes
(NHEK), AICAR and metformin (Met) increased the expression of XPC (Fig. 2I) and CPD
repair (Fig. s1C). Similarly topical AICAR and metformin increased XPC protein levels in
mouse skin (Fig. s1D). Taken together, these data indicate that AICAR and metformin
promote UVB-induced DNA repair in an AMPK-dependent manner.

Activation of the AMPK pathway reduces UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis in mice

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

To determine whether activation of AMPK affects UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis, we
treated SKH-1 hairless mice, which are widely used in photocarcinogenesis as a clinically
relevant animal model, with the AMPK activators AICAR and metformin and then exposed
the mice to UVB radiation three times a week for 23 weeks. Treatment of mice with topical
AICAR or metformin at 24 h after the final treatment increased ACC phosphorylation (Fig.
3A), indicating that both AICAR and metformin activate the AMPK pathway in mouse skin.
Topical treatment with either AICAR or metformin in parallel with UVB treatment not only
significantly delayed the onset of UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis (Fig. 3B; P < 0.05, Logrank test between vehicle and AICAR or metformin groups) but also reduced tumor
multiplicity (Fig. 3C; P < 0.05, Student’s t-test), including both large malignant tumors
(diameter > 1cm, all SCC) and small pre-malignant lesions (diameter < 1cm, all papilloma)
(Fig. 3D). These data indicate that the AMPK activators AICAR and metformin reduce
UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis.
AICAR and metformin reduce cell proliferation through an AMPK-independent mechanism

Author Manuscript

Deregulated cell proliferation is not only critical for tumor growth but also essential for
tumor formation. To determine whether AICAR or metformin plays a role in cell
proliferation in vivo, we assessed the difference in epidermal thickness and the number of
Ki67-positive epidermal cells between vehicle-, AICAR-, or metformin-treated mouse
epidermis. Chronic UVB irradiation increased epidermal thickness about 10-fold, while
AICAR and metformin significantly reduced UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia (Fig. 4AB, P < 0.05, Student’s t-test). In addition, AICAR and metformin reduced the number of
Ki67-positive epidermal cells in sham- or UVB-irradiated mice (Fig. 4C-D; P < 0.05,
Student’s t-test). These data indicate that AICAR and metformin inhibit cell proliferation in
vivo. To determine whether AMPK plays a role in the anti-proliferative action of AICAR
and metformin, we analyzed the effect of AMPK deletion and the effect of AICAR and
metformin on cell proliferation in AMPK WT and KO MEF cells. AMPK deletion increased
cell proliferation significantly at 2 and 3 days in culture (Fig. 4E, P < 0.05 using Student’s ttest and two way ANOVA), indicating that AMPK is critical for controlling cell growth.
AICAR and metformin inhibit cell proliferation in both WT and KO cells at the third day
after plating (Fig. 4F), indicating that AMPK is dispensable for the anti-proliferating effect
of AICAR and metformin.
ERK pathway is inhibited by AICAR and metformin

Author Manuscript

To determine the molecular pathway that mediates the effect of AICAR and metformin on
cell growth, we analyzed the involvement of ERK, a major growth-promoting pathways.
Repeated topical treatment with either AICAR or metformin in mice reduced the
phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 5A). One time treatment also had an inhibitory effect (Fig.
s1D). These data suggest the ERK pathway as a target for AICAR and metformin in the
skin. Similarly, in NHEK cells AICAR and metformin decreased ERK activation (Fig. 5B).
To determine the role of AMPK in ERK activation, we analyzed the difference in ERK
activation in AMPK WT and KO cells. AMPK deletion increased the phosphorylation of
ERK and EGFR (Fig. 5C), an upstream pathway of ERK activation, and the protein levels of

cyclin D1, a downstream target of ERK activation. In AMPK KO cells, inhibiting the EGFR
pathway decreased ERK phosphorylation and cyclin D1 levels, and inhibiting the ERK
pathway reduced cyclin D1 levels (Fig. 5D). These data indicate that AMPK is a suppressor
for the EGFR/ERK/cyclin D1 pathway, a key mitogenic signal in response to growth factor
stimulation. However, AICAR and metformin reduced ERK phosphorylation not only in
AMPK WT cells but also in AMPK KO cells (Fig. 5E), indicating that AICAR and
metformin inhibit ERK through an AMPK-independent pathway. In contrast, neither
AICAR nor metformin affected EGFR phosphorylation, suggesting that AICAR and
metformin target EGFR downstream but ERK upstream pathways. These data suggest that
the anti-proliferative action of AICAR and metformin is mediated through AMPKindependent inhibition of ERK signaling.

Metformin suppresses growth of established tumors and prevents new tumor formation in
UVB-irradiated mice

Author Manuscript

To further advance our findings on the chemopreventive effect of AICAR and metformin
toward potential clinical applications, we analyzed the impact of metformin on tumor
formation and growth in tumor-bearing mice that had been chronically exposed to UVB
radiation. We elected to focus on metformin, as it has been widely used for years for antidiabetic treatment, and thus is more likely to be applied for cancer prevention and
intervention in, for example, non-diabetic high risk individuals who have a history of skin
cancer. To mimic a skin tumorigenesis scenario, we irradiated SKH-1 mice with UVB for 17
weeks until they developed 3–4 tumors on average that were 2–4 mm in diameter. Then
these mice were treated with vehicle, topical metformin (Met-T), or systemic metformin
through oral gavage (Met-G) and continued to be irradiated with UVB (Fig. 6A-B). Both
topical and systemic metformin increased phosphorylation of ACC in non-tumor mouse
skin, indicating AMPK activation (Fig. 6C). Either treatment prevented new tumor
formation (Fig. 6D; P < 0.05, Student’s t-test). In addition, both topical and systemic
metformin treatment significantly inhibited growth of established tumors (Fig. 6E, P < 0.05,
Student’s t-test), while systemic treatment was more effective than topical treatment. This
may be due to the limited penetration of topical treatment for established tumors.

Author Manuscript

To determine the role of cell proliferation, we assessed the effect of topical and systemic
metformin on epidermal hyperplasia and the number of Ki67-positive cells in UVBdamaged non-tumor skin and established tumors. Both topical and systemic metformin
reduced epidermal thickness and the number of Ki67-positive cells in non-tumor skin, while
systemic but not topical metformin reduced the number of Ki67-positive cells in established
tumors (Fig. 6F). Taken together, these data demonstrated that, in tumor-bearing mice, the
most widely used anti-diabetic drug metformin given topically or systemically prevents new
tumor formation and suppresses growth of established tumors in association with inhibiting
cell proliferation, suggesting a potential chemopreventive benefit for individuals with skin
cancer histories and at high risk for skin cancer.

Discussion

Author Manuscript

Recent studies have demonstrated that the energy-sensing enzyme AMPK inhibits growth
and/or survival of cancer cells, and thus AMPK activators including AICAR and the antidiabetic drug metformin might be used to enhance cancer therapy (19, 20). However, the
role AMPK in the response of skin cells to UVB damage and in skin cancer prevention
remains unknown. Here we have shown that the AMPK pathway is down-regulated in
human and mouse skin tumors and in UVB-irradiated mouse skin. The AMPK pathway is
critical for UVB-induced DNA damage repair and growth control. In mice, topical treatment
with the AMPK activators AICAR and metformin prevents UVB-induced skin
tumorigenesis. Topical or systemic metformin prevents new tumor formation and suppresses
growth of established tumors in UVB-irradiated mice with skin tumors. AICAR and
metformin promote UVB-induced DNA damage repair through an AMPK-dependent
mechanism, while they inhibit cell proliferation through an AMPK-dispensable pathway.
Our findings strongly indicate that AICAR and metformin promote the genomic integrity of
normal skin cells following UVB damage and thus reduce skin tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

We demonstrated that AMPK is required for efficient repair of UVB-induced DNA damage,
linking energy metabolism with genomic stability. This was supported by the following
evidence: (1) AICAR and metformin increased UVB-induced DNA damage repair in mouse
skin; (2) deletion of AMPK inhibited DNA repair; and (3) AMPK deletion diminished the
promoting action of AICAR and metformin on DNA repair. At the molecular level, AMPK
inhibition specifically down-regulated XPC, a key protein required for global genome
nucleotide excision repair (GG-NER), while AICAR and metformin increased XPC levels,
suggesting that AMPK positively regulates GG-NER through XPC. Our previous studies
have supported a model in which XPC mediates the function of the deacetylase SIRT1 and
the tumor suppressor PTEN in GG-NER (33, 34). Both SIRT1 and PTEN regulate XPC at
the transcriptional level. However, the regulation of XPC by AMPK seems to be
independent of its transcription or its transcription repressor factors. It is possible that
AMPK regulates the mRNA stability through the RNA binding protein HuR (35). Further
investigation is needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which AMPK regulates
XPC. Nevertheless, our results strongly indicate that AMPK activation is required for fully
operational GG-NER capacity to remove the tumorigenic DNA lesions, i.e., CPD, as failure
to repair CPD is the principle cause of skin cancer (9), and effective GG-NER protects mice
against UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis.

Author Manuscript

In addition, our results indicate that AICAR and metformin inhibit cell proliferation in
mouse skin and reduce UVB-induced epidermal hyperplasia. AMPK suppresses cell
proliferation through inhibiting the mitogenic EGFR/ERK pathway. In contrast, both
AICAR and metformin inhibit the ERK pathway but they had no effect on EGFR activation.
The anti-proliferative action and ERK inhibition of AICAR and metformin are independent
of AMPK action, as AMPK deletion had no effect. Interestingly, previous studies have
identified an opposing effect of AICAR/AMPK on ERK activation. In both NIH-3T3 and
cardiac fibroblasts, AICAR inhibits growth factor-induced ERK activation (36, 37), in an
AMPK-dependent but EGFR-independent manner (36). In contrast, in erythroleukemia
K562 cells, AMPK is required for ERK activation (38). It is possible that the regulation of

ERK activation by AICAR is cell type-specific. In the skin as well as in MEF cells in this
study, AICAR and metformin inhibit the ERK pathway through an AMPK- and EGFRindependent mechanism. Furthermore, although AMPK and meformin have been shown to
suppress the mTOR pathway (19, 20, 39–41), in glioblastomas, AICAR is more effective in
blocking cell proliferation than the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, despite less efficient
inhibition of mTOR signaling (30), thus challenging the dominant role of mTOR inhibition.
We are currently working on identifying the molecular mechanism of AICAR and
metformin for ERK inhibition and proliferation control and elucidating the importance of
mTOR in the chemopreventive action of AICAR and metformin.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we have demonstrated that AMPK may play a critical role in inhibiting skin
carcinogenesis by promoting UVB-induced DNA damage repair and growth control. The
AMPK activators AICAR and metformin reduce UVB-induced skin tumorigenesis. AICAR
and metformin promote UVB-induced DNA damage repair through AMPK activation, while
they decrease cell proliferation through AMPK-independent ERK inhibition. Our findings
suggest that AICAR and the most widely used anti-diabetic drug metformin are potential
chemopreventive agents for skin cancer, especially for individuals with skin cancer history.

All animal procedures have been approved by the University of Chicago Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Hairless SKH-1 mice were obtained from Charles River.
Mice were exposed to UVB (100 mJ/cm2, dose selected to avoid visible sunburn) dorsally or
sham-irradiated, three times a week for up to 25 weeks, to monitor tumor formation and
growth. One hour prior to each UVB irradiation, mice were treated with vehicle (acetone),
AICAR (1 μmol) or metformin (2 μmol). In UVB-irradiated tumor-bearing mice, metformin
was given either topically (2 μmol) or by gavage (300 mg/kg). Mouse skin samples were
fixed in formalin for histological analysis or immunohistochemical analysis for Ki67positive cells (Immunohistochemistry Core facility), or snap-frozen for immunoblotting
analysis. Mice were housed five animals per cage, and there was no evidenceof dorsal
wounds caused by fighting or sunburn.

Western blotting
Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL, USA).
Equal amounts of protein were subjected to electrophoresis. Western blotting was performed
as described previously using film detection (13, 43). Antibodies used included phosphoERK (p-ERK), ERK, phospho-EGFR (p-EGFR), AMPK, ACC, DDB1, DDB2, XPC, E2F4,

In vitro cell proliferation assay, immunohistochemistry, promoter reporter assay and
cytosol-nuclear fractionation

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation of MEF cells were analyzed using the MTS assay (Promega) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions as in our recent studies (44). Immunohistochemical analysis
of Ki67-positive cells in the mouse epidermis was conducted in the Immunohistochemistry
Core facility. The promoter reporter assay and cytosol-nuclear fractionation were performed
as described in our recent studies (33).
Determination of two major forms of UVB-induced DNA damage in genomic DNA by slot
blot assay

Author Manuscript

Slot blot assay of CPD and 6-4PP were performed as described previously (45). Briefly,
mouse skin or cells were collected at different time points post-UVB and DNA was isolated
using a QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The DNA concentration was
calculated from the absorbance at 260 nm using NanoDrop 1000 (NanoDrop products,
Wilmington, DE). The CPD and 6-4PP in DNA were quantified by slot blot (Bio-Rad) with
monoantibodies (TDM-2 for CPD and 64 M-2 for 6-4PP, COSMO BIO Co., Koto-Ku,
Tokyo, Japan) as described previously (45). The chemiluminescence was detected with a
Carestream Imaging Station (Carestream). For examining repair kinetics, the percentage (%)
of repair was calculated by comparing the optical density at the indicated time to that of the
corresponding absorbance at time zero when there was no opportunity for repair and 100%
of CPDs (or 6-4PPs) were present post-UVB.
