ABSTRACT
The paucity of new drugs for the treatment of esophageal squamous cell
carcinoma (ESCC) limits the treatment options. This study characterized the
therapeutic efficacy and action mechanism of a novel natural macrolide compound
F806 in human ESCC xenograft models and cell lines. F806 inhibited growth of ESCC,
most importantly, it displayed fewer undesirable side effects on normal tissues in
two human ESCC xenograft models. F806 inhibited proliferation of six ESCC cells
lines, with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) ranging from 9.31 to
16.43 μM. Furthermore, F806 induced apoptosis of ESCC cells, contributing to its
growth-inhibitory effect. Also, F806 inhibited cell adhesion resulting in anoikis.
Mechanistic studies revealed that F806 inhibited the activation of β1 integrin in part
by binding to a novel site Arg610 of β1 integrin, suppressed focal adhesion formation,
decreased cell adhesion to extracellular matrix and eventually triggered apoptosis.
We concluded that F806 would potentially be a well-tolerated anticancer drug by
targeting β1 integrin, resulting in anoikis in ESCC cells.

Remarkable advances in cancer molecular biology
and pathogenesis have recently led to successful
development of myriad mechanism-based targeted
therapies that substantially improve survival and
quality of life for cancer patients [4]. The vanguard of
novel anticancer drugs often targets cellular signaling
mechanisms, aberrant tumor stroma, and tumor vasculature
and microenvironment [5–7]. Intracellular signaling
network which are propagated from the cell surface to
intracellular processes, comprising extracellular ligands,
transmembrane receptors and cytoplasmic secondary
messengers, often optimizes tumor growth and metastasis
in malignancies, and represents potential selective targets

INTRODUCTION
Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), the
major histologic form of esophageal cancer, is one of the
most frequent fatal malignancies worldwide and the fourth
leading cause of cancer-related death in China [1]. Despite
aggressive treatment modalities such as surgical resection
with extensive lymphadenectomy and surgery combined
with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy, survival of ESCC
patients with recurrence or metastasis remains poor [2, 3].
Therefore, novel safe and effective therapeutic strategies
such as the utilization of targeted therapy drugs are highly
desirable for the patients with ESCC.

for cancer therapy [8]. Integrins are a family of the
heterodimeric cell surface receptors that bind to the cell
extracellular matrix (ECM), promote the transmission of
multiple signaling pathways, and coordinate extensive
broad range of functional activities, such as cell growth,
survival, adhesion, invasion and metastasis [9, 10].
Eighteen α-subunits and eight β-subunits assemble into 24
different integrins [11]. Among these integrins, β1 integrin
has recently been shown to play a key role in regulating
the switch from a dormant state to active proliferation and
metastasis, and confer therapeutic resistance in multiple
solid cancer models [12–16]. Importantly, it has been
reported several possible therapeutic approaches, such as
small molecules or inhibitory antibodies, directing against
β1 integrin signaling to prevent the recurrence of cancer
in experimental models [17–19]. However, β1 integrin as
a strategic molecular target of a novel chemotherapeutic
agent has not been well investigated in ESCC.
The natural compound F806, also named
FW-04-806 is isolated by fermentation of soil
Streptomyces  sp. FIM-04–806, and possesses both
bioxazole and macrodiolide chemical structures
(Supplementary Figure 1) [20, 21]. Our previous study
has been reported that F806 exhibited potent activity
against human cancer cells [22]. In the current study, we
investigated the anti-cancer effect of F806 in ESCC cells
in vivo and in vitro, and the biological activity of F806
against ESCC cells by blocking β1 integrin activation.

lower panel). No significance of biochemical markers for
liver and renal function was found between F806-treated
and control mice (Supplementary Table 3). No effect on
complete blood count including white blood, red blood,
hemoglobin and blood platelet count, was observed
between F806-treated and control mice (Supplementary
Table 4). In addition, no histological abnormality was
shown in lungs, brains, liver, heart and kidneys of mice
between F806-treated and control groups at the end of
drug treatment (Figure 1C). Together, these data suggest
that F806 effectively inhibits tumor growth in the absence
of drug-induced adverse effects.

F806 inhibits cell proliferation in various
ESCC cells
To assess the effects of F806 on cell growth, cell
viability was determined by MTT assay in various
ESCC cell lines, including EC109, KYSE70, KYSE450,
KYSE150, KYSE180, and KYSE510 cells. Meanwhile,
as a positive control, the growth of MTLn3 rat mammary
adenocarcinoma cell was inhibited by F806 with 72 hr
IC50 value of 9.60 μM, which is consistent with a previous
report [22]. Shown in cell viability assays on ESCC cells,
rounding and detachment of cultured cells increased in a
dose- (0–40 μM) and time-dependent (0–72 h) manner
after treatment with F806 (the morphology features of
EC109 cells as shown in Supplementary Figure 2). The
growth-inhibitory effect of F806 was tested in various
ESCC cell lines at 72 hr, with IC50 values of 16.43, 15.89,
10.94, 10.50, 10.28 and 9.31 μM in EC109, KYSE70,
KYSE450, KYSE150, KYSE180, and KYSE510 cells
respectively (Figure 2A). Notably F806 demonstrated
potent growth-inhibitory effects against ESCC cells.

RESULTS
F806 inhibits tumor growth in EC109 and
KYSE510 tumor xenograft models
To assess the antitumor potential of F806 in
xenograft models, EC109 and KYSE510 esophageal
squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells were inoculated
subcutaneously into nude mice. Three groups of xenograft
mice were intraperitoneally administered with vehicle
(control), 4 mg/kg and 8 mg/kg F806 daily for 21 days
respectively and sacrificed at the end. The data showed
that tumors from both of F806-treated groups grew more
slowly than the control group (Figure 1A and 1B). In
detail, no significant difference of the tumor volume in
each group was observed at the beginning of treatment.
However, a significant (P < 0.05) antitumor effect of F806
was displayed in EC109 and KYSE510 xenograft models
beginning at day 8/9 after the start of treatment. At the
end of treatment, 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg F806 reduced tumor
growth by 55.0% (P = 0.015) or 47.2% (P = 0.035) in
EC109 cells, and 62.2% (P = 0.003) or 75.9% (P = 0.000)
in KYSE510 cells, as compared to the control group.
Simultaneously, the safety of F806 was evaluated
in xenograft mice. All mice tolerated this treatment
well without toxic symptoms or signs and had stable
body weights during the treatment (Figure 1A and 1B,

F806 induces cell apoptosis in ESCC cells
We next examined whether the growth-inhibitory
effect of F806 was due to apoptosis. Transmission electron
microscopy revealed condensation and margination of
nuclear chromatin surrounding in the nucleus of EC109
cells treated with F806 for 24 hr, which is strongly
suggestive of apoptotic cell death (Figure 2B). An
apoptotic phenotype was further supported by DNA
laddering, a specific marker for cell apoptosis (Figure 2C)
in F806-treated EC109 cells. On the other hand, cell cycle
analysis presented the presence of a sub-G1 DNA peak in
F806-treated EC109 cells (Figure 2D). Furthermore, the
apoptosis precursor (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) was
cleaved, along with the reduction of PARP and the increase
of cleaved PARP in F806-treated ESCC cells (Figure 2E).
To further confirm the F806-induced apoptosis in ESCC
cells, tumor sections from xenograft models were stained
for nuclear apoptosis using the DeadEnd Fluorometric
TUNEL reagent staining (Figure 2F). In contrast to
control group, tumors from the F806-treated group

to growth inhibition and cell death in ESCC cells.

investigated in different ECM conditions and different
treatments. As shown in Figure  3B, F806 significantly
inhibited cell adhesion, while there was no selectivity
on fibronectin (FN), collagen (COL) or laminin (LAM).
Furthermore, when EC109 and KYSE510 cells were kept
in FN or COL-coated plates for 30 min and treated with
F806 for another 24 h (Figure 3C), or kept for 24 h prior
to 30 min of F806 stimulation (Figure 3D), cell adhesion
was still significantly inhibited. These data indicated that
F806 clearly inhibited cell adhesion, indicating anoikis.

F806 inhibits cell adhesion and sensitizes ESCC
cells to anoikis
ESCC cells, as epithelial cells, require attachment
to an appropriate extracellular matrix (ECM) in order
to survive [23]. Interestingly, we noted that ESCC
cells began to round up and detach after 24 hr of F806treatment, however, visible inhibition of growth was
not observed until 48 hr after treatment. After 48 hr
and 72 hr of treatment, the adherent cells significantly
decreased, while the floating dead cells increased
(Supplementary Figure 2). These results clued that F806
inhibited cell adhesion, resulting in the induction of
apoptosis in a process named ‘anoikis’ [24]. When EC109
and KYSE510 cells were cultured in poly-HEMA plates
in presence of F806, a significant induction of anoikis
in a dose-dependent manner was found (Figure 3A).
Additionally, the effect of F806 on cell adhesion was

F806 inhibits focal adhesion formation in
ESCC cells
The results of anoikis led us to the hypothesis
that adhesion complex formation might be inhibited in
ESCC cells by F806. To investigate the effect of F806
on adhesion complex formation, focal adhesion marker
Paxillin and Kindlin-2 was detected F806-treated cells
by immunofluorescence staining. After cells on FN,
COL or LAM-coated coverslips treated with F806 for
24 hr, focal adhesion were clearly observed in the basal

layer of cells and the cell shapes remained normal in the
control group, however, focal adhesion formation were
obviously inhibited in F806-treated group (Figure 4A
and 4B, left panel). The observations were supported by
experiments on both of focal adhesion marker Paxillin and
Kindlin-2. Additionally, the effect of F806 on expression
of Paxillin and Kindlin-2 were evaluated by Western blot.
As shown in Figure 4A and 4B, right panel, compared to
the control, no difference on expression of Paxillin and
Kindlin-2 were found in F806-treated cells. Therefore,
F806 inhibited focal adhesion formation of ESCC cells
and consequently inhibited cells to attach to ECM.

We next investigated the potential mechanism
of F806 involved in the inhibition of cell adhesion.
Previous studies have shown that integrins mediate
cells to ECM and promote the transmission of multiple
signaling pathways for the initiation of cell proliferation,
including ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT [25, 26]. Western
blot analysis revealed that no apparent effect on the
total protein level of β1 integrin, β4 integrin and α5
integrin was observed; nevertheless, F806 inhibited

β1 integrin activation in KYSE510 and EC109 cells by
immunoprecipitation (Figure 5A). Moreover, tumor
sections from xenograft models were immunochemistry
stained for active β1 integrin. Compared to control group,
tumors from the F806-treated group showed obvious
inhibition of active β1 integrin (Figure 5B). To provide
further evidence, we examined signal molecules known
to be activated in the downstream of integrin signaling.
Decreases in levels of activated FAK (p-FAK), AKT
(p-AKT) and ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2) were observed in F806treated ESCC cells (Figure 5C).
To determine whether F806 inhibited the activation
of β1 integrin, resulting in inhibition of cell adhesion and
inducing anoikis, the blockade of the activation of β1
integrin using specific antibody JB1A and down-regulation
of β1 integrin by siRNA were examined to mimic the
effect of F806. As shown in Figure 5D, the blockade of
the activation of β1 integrin inhibited cell adhesion in
KYSE510 cells; however, F806 was more effective and the
combination of anti-β1 integrin with F806 caused the most
suppression of cell adhesion. Furthermore, knockdown of
β1 integrin by siRNA certainly decreased the number of
cell adhesion; nevertheless, F806 still was more effective.
Importantly, after the knockdown of β1 integrin, mounting
inhibition ratio of cell adhesion was found in F806treated KYSE510 cells (Figure 5E). Collectively, it can
be concluded that F806 would inhibit the activation of β1
integrin, leading to inhibition of focal adhesion formation
and cell adhesion, finally triggering apoptosis.

intraperitoneal administration, which is far below the
reported minimal dose of 50 mg/kg [22]. The lower dose
in the treatment of ESCC models representative of lower
toxicity, is a prerequisite for a successful pharmacological
agent against cancer. Indeed, F806 exhibited good safety
during the treatment in ESCC xenografts: no abnormality
in body weight, daily diet, liver and renal function,
hematological indices, and histological characteristics
in the lungs, brain, heart, kidney and liver tissue, were
observed (Figure 1C, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4).
Considering that the in vivo experiments was performed
only with xenograft models in this study, the efficacy
and safety of F806 should be further investigated in
spontaneous human cancer models.
Our previous study reported that F806, could bind
to the N-terminal of Hsp90 and inhibit Hsp90/Cdc37
interaction, resulting in the disassociation of Hsp90/
Cdc37/client complexes and the degradation of Hsp90
client proteins in breast cancer cells [22]. Here our
observations suggested that another novel anti-cancer
mechanism of F806 would exist in ESCC cells. Firstly,
cell growth of ESCC cells were inhibited owing to the
induction of apoptosis, which was supported by multiple
evidences including the DNA laddering, the condensation
and margination of nuclear chromatin surrounding through
transmission electron microscope. However, cells started
floating after 24 hr of treatment, while the inhibition of
growth was not visibly observed until 48 hr after the
treatment. This phenomenon provided clues for the
hypothesis of detachment as a cause of growth inhibition
and apoptosis in F806-treated ESCC cells. Indeed, anoikis
induction contributed to the potent antitumor effects
of F806, as evidenced by inhibition of cell adhesion to
the ECM components including FN, COL and LAM.
Furthermore, the inhibition of focal adhesion formation
was detected by immunofluorescence, which confirmed
the results. These results strongly supported the notion
that F806 attenuated cell adhesion, contributing to the
inhibition of cell growth, i.e., anoikis.
Upon adhesion to ECMs, integrins as a large family
of heterodimeric cell surface receptors, govern cellECM interactions and mediate cell adhesion and provide
critical signaling that regulates cellular proliferation and
survival [25, 26, 28]. Previous observations proposed
that chemopreventive drugs or small molecules would
induce apoptosis by modulating integrin-mediated
signaling [29, 30]. In our present study, no apparent effect
on the protein level of β1 integrin, β4 integrin and α5
integrin was observed; nevertheless, the activation of β1
integrin was inhibited by F806 both in vitro and in vivo.
Activation of integrins is essential for cell adhesion and
matrix assembly [11]. An increase in the proportion
of heterodimers adopting high-affinity comformation
(the affinity of integrins for their ligands) was termed
integrin activation [31]. It has been widely accepted

DISCUSSION
This study reported on the efficacy and mechanism
of action of a novel macrolide analog F806 in preclinical
models of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).
Anticancer activity of F806 was evaluated in two human
ESCC xenograft models and in six ESCC cell lines. Our
data showed principle mechanisms for how F806 inhibited
the growth in ESCC cells: F806 decreased the activation
of β1 integrin, prevented cancer cells away from the ECM,
and eventually initiated apoptosis (Figure 6).
In 1979, Westley JW et al. reported the isolation
of the novel compound conglobatin from fermentation
cultures of Streptomyces conglobatus ATCC 31005,
which has the same molecular formula as F806;
however, antifungal, antibacterial, antiprotozoal, or
antitumor activity remained unclear [27]. F806, also
named FW-04-806, was extracted from the China-native
Streptomyces FIM-04–806 and demonstrated potent
anticancer activity in K562 human chronic myelocytic
leukemia cells, SKBR3 and MCF-7 human breast cancer
cells [20–22]. In the present study, F806 displays promising
antitumor activity in ESCC cells and showed very low
toxicity to the non-cancerous cells. Notably, F806 reduced
the volume of ESCC xenografts at a 4 mg/kg/d dose by

that the binding of Talins and Kindlins to β1 integrin
is critical for integrin activation [32–33]. Therefore,
the inactivation of β1 integrin would in part inhibit the
affinity of integrins for their ligands, resulting in anoikis.
Classically, β1 integrin acts largely as mechanoreceptors,
not only facilitating growth factor receptor signaling, but
also transmitting biochemical cues that mediate multiple
aspects of malignant cell behavior [34, 35]. These roles
of β1 integrin prompt us to identify it as a potential target
of F806 in ESCC cells. The decrease in the downstream
signal molecules (such as p-FAK, p-AKT and p-ERK1/2)
of integrin signaling confirmed the suppression of β1
integrin activation by F806 in ESCC cells.
The specific blockade of β1 integrin antibody was
performed to determine whether the inhibition of β1
integrin activation by F806 resulted in suppression of
cell adhesion and inducing anoikis. It was showed that
F806 revealed greater inhibitory effect on cell adhesion
in ESCC cells, in contrast to specific anti-β1 integrin
JB1A. Nevertheless, the combination of F806 with
JB1A could cause the most suppression of cell adhesion
in ESCC cells (Figure 5D). The potential synergistic
effect of F806 and JB1A on the inhibition of cell
adhesion hinted different binding site between F806 and
JB1A. Anti-β1 integrin JB1A was recently mapped to

recognize and bind residues 82–87 of β1 integrin chain,
leading to the inhibition of cell adhesion [36]. Based
on these observations, docking computation model was
performed to predict possible F806-binding site of β1
integrin. Indeed, it was presented that F806 would interact
with Arg610 site of β1 integrin by pi bond (π bond)
(Supplementary Figure 3). However, detailed investigation
might be necessary to clarify the mechanism of the
interaction between F806 and Arg610 site of β1 integrin.
Our study also showed that the knockdown of β1
integrin indeed decreased cell adhesion in KYSE510
cells, while F806 still was more effective than si-β1
integrin. Intriguingly, after the remarkable knockdown
of β1 integrin, mounting inhibition ratio of cell adhesion
was found in F806-treated KYSE510 cells (Figure 5E).
Obviously, after the loss of the target molecule β1 integrin
by si-RNA, F806 still could suppress KYSE510 cells
binding to ECM. It hinted that β1 integrin would not be
the only potential target of F806 in ESCC cells. Among
the 24 different integrins, there are eight β-subunits [11].
Furthermore, other integrins has been highly attractive
target in oncology therapy, such as that cilengitide is
an RGD pentapeptide inhibitor of αV integrin against
glioblastoma [37]. Therefore, F806 might also direct
or indirect against other integrin subunit and further

investigations would be warranted to verify the detailed
mechanism.
Mounting experimental evidence supports that drug
resistance of a targeted therapeutic agent can be acquired,
because inhibition of one key pathway in a tumor may
not completely turn off other parallel signaling pathways,
allowing some cancer cells to survive and propagate. On
this basis, Hanahan and Weinberg proposed that it could
be necessary to target as many key pathways as possible,
to prevent the development of adaptive resistance [38].
Potent angiogenesis inhibitors such as bevacizumab,
has succeeded in suppressing tumor growth in clinical
or preclinical models. However, acquired resistance
can develop, resulting in increased invasion and local
metastasis [39–43]. Integrin β1 signaling mediates
therapeutic resistance in multiple solid cancer models
[12–14]. Furthermore, targeting β1 integrin inhibits
tumor growth in bevacizumab-resistant glioblastoma
[13]. In this study, it was clearly demonstrated that
F806 could induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth via
blocking the activation of β1 integrin. It implies that
F806 could overcome resistance to antiangiogenesis
therapy and would be of potential use in combination with
angiogenesis inhibitors.
In summary, our data indicate that the novel drug
F806 revealed promising antitumor activity in ESCC
models and showed very low toxicity to the non-cancerous
cells. In addition, this study highlights the inhibition
of β1 integrin activation as a potential mechanism of
F806, contributing to the suppression of focal adhesion
formation, the prevention of further tumor growth and
survival from the ECM, and the eventual initiation of
apoptosis (i.e., anoikis) in ESCC cells. Therefore, F806
merits further evaluation and precise delineation as a
therapeutic agent against human ESCC.

pathogen-free conditions, with free access to food and
water. All animal studies were conducted in accordance
with protocols approved by the Animal Research
Committee of the Shantou Administration Center. Mice
were inoculated subcutaneously with 1.0 × 106 EC109
or 1.0 × 106 KYSE510 human esophageal squamous
cell carcinoma (ESCC) cells on the right flank. The next
day, mice were randomized to three groups of 10 mice
per group. Tumor growth was monitored daily, and tumor
size was measured at (length × width2) × 0.5 twice per
week. At approximately day 12 post tumor cell injection,
when the tumor volume reached approximately 0.5 mm
in diameter, drug administration was initiated. Mice with
a tumor volume of < 0.1 mm or > 1.0 mm in diameter
were excluded from drug treatment. Briefly, a 100 mg/ml
F806 stock solution was prepared in 100% ethyl alcohol.
On the day of injection, F806 was diluted in 0.9% NaCl
containing 5% Tween-80 and 5% polyethylene glycol-400
(Sigma, St Louis MO, USA) to a final concentration such
that a dose of 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg, in 200 μL solution,
was administered to each mouse. F806 solution was
intraperitoneally administered daily for 21 days. Mice
were euthanized on day 22 and blood was collected for
biochemical analysis or complete blood count (including
differential and platelet counts). Tumors were excised,
weighed, and preserved in formalin for histological
analysis. The lungs, liver, heart, brains and kidneys were
harvested and evaluated histologically.

Cell viability assay
Cells inoculated in 96-well plates were treated
with different concentrations of F806 for 72 hr. Changes
in cell morphology were documented by photography
every 24 hr. Cell viability was measured using a
3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) proliferation kit (Sigma, St. Louis, USA)
at 72 hr, as described by the manufacturer. The formed
crystals were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide and optical
density (OD) in each well was measured at a method of
dual-wavelength of 490 nm using a microplate reader.
Inhibition of growth was expressed as an inhibition ratio
(%) = (1 − OD490Treated/OD490Control) × 100 or a growth
ratio (%) = OD490Treated/OD490Control × 100. The half
maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated
from the inhibition ratio and F806 concentration by SPSS
13.0 software.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and cell lines
The compound F806, also named FW-04-806
(purity ≥ 98.5%), was produced by Fujian Institute of
Microbiology, China (Supplementary Figure 1) [20, 21].
It was dissolved in DMSO at 100 mM as a stock solution
and further diluted in medium before each use. The
characteristics of the seven squamous cell carcinoma cell
lines prepared for this study and general information are
shown in Supplementary Table 1. All cells were incubated
at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.

manufacturer’s protocol. These tissue sections were
subsequently stained for nuclei with 500 ng/mL propidium
iodide (PI). The samples were immediately analyzed under
a fluorescence microscope using a standard fluorescent
filter set to view the green fluorescence at 520 nm and red
fluorescence of PI at > 620 nm. The slides were imaged
using an Openlab controlled microscope.

Dna ladder assay
Cells treated with F806 for 24 hr were harvested and
the DNA was extracted with the Apoptotic DNA Ladder
Kit (Beyotime Institute of Biotechnology, Shanghai,
China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. DNA
was analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and
visualized under UV light.

Anoikis assay
For determination of anoikis, 2 × 105 cells
were cultured on 24-well plates coated with poly
(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (poly-HEMA) (Cell
Biolabs, Inc., CBA-080, San Diego, CA, USA) in
presence of various F806 for 72 hr. Cell viability was
determined by MTT colorimetric detection and presented
as mean percentage of control sample plus or minus
standard deviation (SD). All experiments were performed
in triplicate.

Cell cycle analysis
Cells treated with F806 for 24 hr were harvested
and were fixed with 70% cold ethanol in PBS at 4°C
overnight. Subsequently, the samples were permeabilized
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with 0.1% Triton
X-100 and stained again with a solution containing
5  μg  /mL propidium iodide (PI) and 50 μg/mL RNase,
for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Finally, the
samples were immediately analyzed by flow cytometry
using a Coulter Epics XL flow cytometer (BeckmanCoulter Inc, Brea, CA, USA). Fluorescence emitted from
the PI-DNA complex was determined by FlowJo software
(TreeStar, San Carlos, CA, USA). Cell cycle distribution
was calculated using Multicycle software (Phoenix Flow
Systems, San Diego, CA, USA).

Adhesion assay
Ninety-six well plates were coated with Fibronectin
(10 μg/mL, Sigma, F-2006, St. Louis, MO, USA),
Collagen IV (10 μg/mL, Sigma, C-7521) or Laminin (10
μg/mL, Sigma, L-2020) at 4°C overnight. After removal of
excess coating buffer and one wash with PBS, nonspecific
binding sites were blocked for 1 hr in 0.1% bovine serum
albumin (BSA) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at
room temperature, following with a second wash with
PBS. EC109 and KYSE510 cells (2 × 104) in 100 μL
serum-free medium with or without F806 per well, were
allowed to adhere for 24 hr at 37 C in a humidified 5%
CO2 incubator. In the adhesion inhibition assay, antibody
JB1A against the β1 integrin (1:100, Millipore, MAB1965,
Bedford, MA) blocking cell adhesion to Fibronectin, was
added to KYSE510 cells for 30 min prior to seeding.
Nonspecific adherent cells were removed by washing
with PBS three times. Adherent cells were subsequently
measured by MTT colorimetric detection. Cell adhesion
was presented as mean percentage of control sample plus
or minus standard deviation (SD). All experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Western blot analysis
After cells were treated with F806 for 24 hr, total
cell lysates were prepared in Laemmli sample buffer
(Bio-Rad, 101–0737, Hercules, CA, USA). Western blots
were performed as described previously [44]. Primary
antibodies to ERK1/2, α5 integrin, β4 integrin and β-actin
were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa
Cruz, CA, USA), while antibodies to PARP, phosphoERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2, Tyr204), phospho-AKT (p-AKT,
Ser473) and AKT were purchased from Cell Signaling
Technology (Danvers, MA, USA), along with phosphoFAK (p-FAK, Tyr397) from Invitrogen (Camarillo, CA,
USA), Kindlin-2 from OriGene Technologies ( Rockville,
MD, USA), FAK, paxillin, and β1 integrin from BD
Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, New Jersey,
USA). Appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, Texas,
USA). Detailed information about the antibodies is listed
in Supplementary Table 2.

Immunofluorescence
Cells grown on coverslips coated or uncoated
with 10 μg/mL fibronectin, collagen IV or Laminin at
4°C overnight, were treated with F806 for 24 hr. After
incubation, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After blocking with 5%
donkey serum in PBS for 60 min, cells were stained
with mouse anti-paxillin or mouse anti-kindlin-2 at 4°C
overnight. After washing, samples were incubated with
Alexa Fluor  488-AffiniPure Donkey anti-mouse IgG
(Jackson, 711–545-150, Newmarket, Suffolk, UK, 1:200).

Measurement of β1 integrin activity by
immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously
[45, 46]. Cells were inoculated on fibronectin-coated (10 μg/
mL) cell culture dishes, in the absence or presence of 20 μM
F806 for 24 hr. Cells were lysed in 4°C Triton lysis buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100,
and 5 mM EDTA) with 1X Halt Protease and Phosphatase
Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., 78441,
Rockford, IL, USA). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated
with anti-active β1 integrin (CHEMICON International,
Inc., MAB2079Z, Billerica, MA, USA), rotating overnight
at 4°C. Immune complexes were sedimented (3000 rpm for
3 minute at 4°C) and washed five times with ice-cold lysis
buffer. The pelleted immune complexes were resuspended
in 1× Laemmli sample buffer and boiled before being
resolved by SDS-PAGE.
