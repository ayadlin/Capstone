Abstract
Chromosomal rearrangements account for all erythroblast
transformation–specific (ETS) family member gene fusions
that have been reported in prostate cancer and have clinical,
diagnostic, and prognostic implications. Androgen-regulated
genes account for the majority of the 5¶ genomic regulatory
promoter elements fused with ETS genes. TMPRSS2-ERG,
TMPRSS2-ETV1, and SLC45A3-ERG rearrangements account
for roughly 90% of ETS fusion prostate cancer. ELK4, another
ETS family member, is androgen regulated, involved in
promoting cell growth, and highly expressed in a subset of
prostate cancer, yet the mechanism of ELK4 overexpression is
unknown. In this study, we identified a novel ETS family fusion
transcript, SLC45A3-ELK4, and found it to be expressed in
both benign prostate tissue and prostate cancer. We found
high levels of SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA restricted to a subset of
prostate cancer samples. SLC45A3-ELK4 transcript can be
detected at high levels in urine samples from men at risk
for prostate cancer. Characterization of the fusion mRNA
revealed a major variant in which SLC45A3 exon 1 is fused to
ELK4 exon 2. Based on quantitative PCR analyses of DNA,
unlike other ETS fusions described in prostate cancer, the
expression of SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA is not exclusive to cases
harboring a chromosomal rearrangement. Treatment of
LNCaP cancer cells with a synthetic androgen (R1881)
revealed that SLC45A3-ELK4, and not endogenous ELK4,
mRNA expression is androgen regulated. Altogether, our
findings show that SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA expression is
heterogeneous, highly induced in a subset of prostate cancers,
androgen regulated, and most commonly occurs through
a mechanism other than chromosomal rearrangement
(e.g., trans-splicing). [Cancer Res 2009;69(7):2734–8]

Introduction
Emerging data suggest that erythroblast transformation specific
(ETS)–rearranged prostate cancer, similar to other translocation
tumors, represents a distinct subclass of prostate cancer based on
studies demonstrating varying morphologic features (1), survival

(2, 3), and a specific expression profile (4, 5). Androgen-regulated
genes account for the majority of the 5¶ genomic regulatory
promoters elements fused with ETS genes in prostate cancer (6).
The promoter of the androgen-regulated transmembrane protease,
serine 2 (TMPRSS2) gene is fused to the coding region of members
of the ETS family of transcription factors, most commonly v-ets
erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogene homologue (avian; ERG; ref. 7).
Solute carrier family 45, member 3 (SLC45A3), also referred to as
prostein, is a prostate-specific, androgen-regulated gene that has
been shown to be a 5¶ partner with ETV1 and ETV5 (6, 8) and more
recently with the coding sequence of ERG (9).
Interestingly, ELK4 (ETS-domain protein SRF accessory
protein 1), a member of the ETS family of transcription factors,
has recently been described as a novel androgen receptor target in
LNCaP cells promoting cell growth and is highly expressed in a
subset of prostate cancer samples compared with benign prostate
tissues (10). Herein, we report the expression of novel SLC45A3ELK4 transcripts in prostate cancer. We provide data characterizing
different SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA variants and evidence that this
transcript does not primarily arise from a chromosomal rearrangement as seen for other ETS fusion events in prostate cancer.

Materials and Methods
Sample preparation. Tissue samples were collected as part of
an institutional review board–approved protocol and RNA was extracted
(see Supplementary Methods).
Conventional reverse transcription-PCR sequencing. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using primers to SLC45A3 exon 1
(5-CCGCGGAGTAACCTGGAGATTT-3) and ELK4 exon 2 (5-TGCCCATCATTAGAGGTCCAACAG-3; see Supplementary Methods for details).
Quantitative RT-PCR using Taqman technology. We used TaqMan
Gene Expression Assays (see Supplementary Methods for details).
Chromosome 1q32, SLC45A3 to ELK4 region assessment was performed
using quantitative PCR (qPCR) and primers specific to 13 regions on
chromosome 1 (see Supplementary Methods for details).
Functional studies were performed using R1881 on LNCaP cells
(see Supplementary Methods for details).

Results
SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA is expressed in prostate cancer,
benign prostate tissue, and the LNCaP cancer line. We
developed a Taqman assay targeting SLC45A3 exon 1 and ELK4
exon 2 (Fig. 1). We initially screened RNA from 31 prostate cancer
samples, 6 benign prostate tissue samples, and 11 cell lines
including malignant prostate (LNCaP, PC-3, 22Rv1, VCaP, NCIH660, DU-145), nonprostate (ACHN, Caki-1, A-498, HK-2), and

nonmalignant prostate (RWPE-1) epithelial cell lines. All samples
yielded detectable albeit low SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA transcript
expression levels (Fig. 2A). Three prostate cancer samples showed
high SCL45A3-ELK4 expression with levels >10-fold over the
median level calculated from benign prostate tissue. Levels of
endogenous ELK4 mRNA varied widely in all prostate samples
tested. Although we found a good overall correlation between
endogenous ELK4 mRNA and SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA levels
(r = 0.86), several samples yielded significantly different expression
values between the two transcripts. We also found relative
increased levels of SLC45A3-ELK4 in PC-3 and LNCaP cells and
the human epithelial-like kidney adenocarcinoma cell line ACHN.
SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA variants in prostate cancer. We
performed conventional RT-PCR followed by cDNA sequencing to
characterize the composition of the SLC45A3-ELK4 transcripts of
amplified products obtained from 35 prostate cancer samples,
6 benign samples, 6 prostate cancer cell lines, and 1 benign cell
line (Supplementary Fig. S1). Given the lower sensitivity of this
approach, only the majority of the samples yielded a major product
that consisted of SLC45A3 exon 1 fused to ELK4 exon 2 (Fig. 2B; see
Supplementary Information for junction sequence). Three less
common products were detected consisting of a portion of SLC45A3
exon 2 fused to ELK4 exon 2. Interestingly, we found one amplified
product that consisted of 84 bp of intergenic sequence separating
SLC45A3 exons 1 and 2 to ELK4 exon 2. Using the unbiased
approach, 5¶ RNA ligase–mediated rapid amplification of cDNA
ends (RACE), we confirmed another SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA variant
consisting of SLC45A3 exons 1-3 fused to the same 84-bp sequence
described above followed by ELK4 exon 2 in sample 1701_A.
SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA can be detected using a noninvasive
assay. We screened 14 prebiopsy, postdigital exam urine specimens
from men who were at risk of having prostate cancer using our
SLC45A3-ELK4 Taqman assay. According to pathology reports of

www.aacrjournals.org

the biopsied prostate tissue, 8 of the 14 specimens were diagnosed
with prostate cancer (Fig. 2C). Detectable levels of SLC45A3-ELK4
transcript were measured in six of eight corresponding urine
specimens and two of the six specimens from men whose biopsies
did not reveal prostate cancer (sensitivity of 75% and a specificity
of 67%). Interestingly, as seen in the prostate tissue, high levels
(>10-fold) were detected in only a few of the prostate cancer–
associated samples.
Chromosome rearrangement does not account for SLC45A3ELK4 expression. The development of a standard fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) break-apart assay requires using bacterial
artificial chromosomes that usually span 100 to 150 kb. The distance
from SLC45A3 to ELK4 is 25 kb and thus was not suitable for
detecting a possible deletion between these genes (Supplementary
Fig. S2). To explore for genomic loss within the region separating
SLC45A3 and ELK4, we analyzed 13 loci on chromosome covering
this region (Fig. 3). The resulting amplicon raw data was normalized
to a region on chromosome 1 (within ARHGEF) that is not altered
from HapMap SNP data (11). Deletion or partial deletion of this
region was observed in several samples with both high (420_D and
1024_D) and low (38_T, 436_D and 25_T) SLC45A3-ELK4 transcript
levels. The majority of samples were assessed as copy number neutral
or showed genomic gain in this region. This included one sample
(427_A) with high levels of SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA but copy number
neutral and one sample (1701_A) that had low SLC45A3-ELK4
mRNA and high DNA amplification in this region. Taken together,
we did not observe a consistent loss of genomic DNA in cases with
SLC45A3-ELK expression.
SLC45A3-ELK4 is androgen regulated. To address the
confounding results from Makkonnen and colleagues (10), who
recently reported that ELK4 is a novel androgen receptor target in
LNCaP cells, we repeated their experiment using our assay for the
SLC45A3-ELK4 transcript in addition to an assay for ELK4 that

does not target the fusion transcript. As anticipated, 12 hours
following treatment with a synthetic androgen (R1881, 1 nmol/L),
we observed a 25-fold induction of SLC45A3-ELK4 but no change in
ELK4 (Fig. 4). This induction was abrogated in the presence of the
androgen antagonist Flutamide. As a control, we also measured the
levels of KLK3 (PSA) mRNA and observed a similar profile.

Discussion
This is the first description of novel multiple ETS family fusion
(SLC45A3-ELK4) transcripts, high levels of which are restricted to a
subset of prostate cancer samples. Characterization of the fusion
mRNA revealed a major variant in which SLC45A3 exon 1 is fused
to ELK4 exon 2. Other minor variants include other downstream
exons of both genes and more interestingly, an 84-bp chromosome
sequence separating the two genes. Chromosome 1q32.1 has been

cited as a region that is involved in chromosome loss in prostate
cancer (12). Interestingly, exon 1 of SLC45A3 is located roughly
50 kb telomeric on 1q32.1 from ELK4 exon 2 and is transcribed
in the same direction. We observed a chromosome deletion of
the interstitial region separating TMPRSS2 and ERG in 60%
of TMPRSS2-ERG fusion prostate cancers (13). However, our data
suggest that this is a less common event and that the expression
of SLC45A3-ELK4 fusion transcript may more commonly occur
through another mechanism. This is consistent with a recent
report analyzing ETS genes and known 5¶ fusion partners using
FISH (9).
Chimeric mRNA resulting from trans-splicing has been observed
between pre-mRNAs from the same gene (homotypic transsplicing; ref. 14) and pre-mRNAs from different genes (intergenic
trans-splicing; ref. 15) as well as reported from computational
analyses (16). We have also noted numerous trans-splicing events

Makkonen and colleagues reported an induction of ELK4 mRNA

in metastatic, hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Our current
study confirms that ELK4 is overexpressed in prostate cancer but
only in a subset of tumors and correlated with high SLC45A3-ELK4
mRNA. Only SLC45A3-ELK4 mRNA, and not endogenous ELK4
mRNA, is up-regulated upon treatment of LNCaP cells with R1881.

This finding suggests that Makkonen and colleagues were
measuring SLC45A3-ELK4 expression and not the wild-type ELK4.
This has direct implications to the putative oncogenic properties of
ELK4. Recent work from our group identified an estrogen-mediated
activation of TMPRSS2-ERG transcription (4). Non–androgenregulated mechanisms for SLC45A3 will also need to be explored
in future work. Based on our data, we found increased levels of
SLC45A3-ELK4 in the human epithelial-like kidney adenocarcinoma cell line ACHN. This suggests that this transcript is not prostate
specific. Large-scale screening of multiple cancer and noncancer
tissue types is needed to determine the specificity and the extent
of SLC45A3-ELK4 expression.
Finally, the SLC45A3-ELK4 fusion transcript may also have
potential clinical applications. Similar to TMPRSS2-ERG and PCA3
(17, 18), SLC45A3-ELK4 is detected at higher levels in prostate
cancer than in benign prostate tissue. We showed a proof-ofprinciple that the SLC45A3-ELK4 transcript can be detected at high
levels on urine samples from patients with prostate cancer and
therefore might be a useful biomarker. Clearly, larger cohorts of
urine samples will need to be analyzed to be able to determine if
detection of this transcript will provide added diagnostic utility.
In summary, we describe for the first time novel fusion events
between the androgen-regulated 5¶ prime promoter SLC45A3 and
the ETS gene ELK4. We were unable to confirm if some of these

fusions are due to genomic rearrangement or if trans-splicing
explains this phenomenon. A combination of the two mechanisms
is also possible. The SLC45A3-ELK4 transcripts can be detected in a
range of prostate cancers and benign prostate tissues; however,
due to higher levels in cancer, we also propose SLC45A3-ELK4
transcripts as a putative prostate cancer biomarker. The biological
implications of this fusion transcript are yet to be determined.
