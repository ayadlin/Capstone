ABSTRACT
Aberration in DNA replication is a major cause to genome instability that is
a hallmark of cancer cells. Cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6) and c-Myc have a critical
role in the initiation of DNA replication. However, whether their interaction induces
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and promotes tumorigenesis in in vivo
animal model remains unclear. Since using zebrafish as a cancer model has been
restricted by the late onset of tumorigenesis and extreme difficulty in transformation
on skin, we tried to establish a novel non-melanoma skin model in zebrafish to study
their role in tumorigenesis. A stable transgenic zebrafish was created by using tol2
transposon, in which cdc6 and c-myc were co-overexpressed in epidermis driven by
a skin-specific krt4 promoter. Intriguingly, co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc in
transgenic zebrafish skin triggered tumor-like transformation, apoptosis attenuation,
genomic instability, and EMT, hallmarks of malignant tumorigenesis. Our findings
and other characteristics of zebrafish, including optical clarity and small molecule
treatment, provide the future utility of this model for easy and non-invasive detection
and for identification of new anti-cancer drug.

INTRODUCTION

(MCM) complex on chromatin [1, 2]. Deregulation
of normal replication mechanism can create a cellular
environment, termed replication stress [3], prone to
genomic instability that is a hallmark of cancer [4].
Indeed, high levels of Cdc6 and Cdt1 have been observed
in various types of cancer [5-8]. Cdc6 has been reported to
interact with c-Myc that increases the replication activity
with subsequent DNA damage [9]. However, the ability
of Cdt1 and Cdc6 overexpression leads to rereplication,

DNA replication is initiated by coordinated binding
and highly controlled activation of the prereplicative
complex (pre-RC). The pre-RC is called a replication
licensing machinery including two replication licensing
factors, Cdt1 and Cdc6 that are recruited during G1-S
transition on the origin recognition complexes and
promote the loading of mini-chromosome maintenance

providing seeds for chromosome instability, has been
recently challenged [10]. In addition, overexpression
of Cdc6 induced by Ras or Mos oncogenes causes
replication stress that activates DNA damage response
(DDR)-mediated senescence [11, 12]. In addition to the
licensing factor mechanism, Cdc6 interacts with c-Myc
to repress E-box-dependent transcription by interfering
with the formation of c-Myc/Max complex [13]; it exert
its oncogenic activity by repressing the INK4/ARF [7] and
CDH1 locus [14] that encodes E-cadherin, a marker of
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However,
the issues of whether their interaction induces EMT and
whether the interaction promotes cancer development in
in vivo animal model remain obscure.
The zebrafish has become a good lower vertebrate
model for studying carcinogenesis in recent years.
Compared to other higher vertebrate models, zebrafish
model advantages its rapid development, fecundity,
amenability to both forward and reverse genetic strategies,
body transparency, and suitability to in vivo imaging
and chemical screening. Importantly, tumor in zebrafish
resembles various types of human tumors at either the
histological level [15] or cancer characteristics such as
genomic instability, neoplastic cell transformation, and
oncogene activation [16, 17]. For instance, several lossof-function of tumor suppressors, such as tp53 [18], PTEN
[19] and APC [20], or gain-of-function of oncogenes,
c-myc [21], Akt2 [22], and K-ras [23], have been
established in zebrafish, which showed similar phenotypes
to human cancer.
Although great advances have been achieved in
zebrafish cancer model, several obstacles still need to be
overcome in order to develop zebrafish as a promising
and complementary cancer model. First, the onset of
tumor transformation is quite late and usually occurs
during juvenile to adult stages. For example, the first
appearance of liver cancer in zebrafish is around 3 to 4
weeks post-fertilization after deregulated activation of
oncogenes [24]. Second, some tissues like skin proceed
oncogenic transformation with extreme difficulty. Third,
since the body transparency at adult stage is reduced, it
is hard to detect tumor formation and metastasis at adult
stage by appearance. Therefore, how to induce the early
onset of cancer formation on skin and develop an easy,
non-invasive detection methodology are two key issues to
the establishment of zebrafish cancer model.
In this study, we aimed to create a novel nonmelanoma skin cancer model in zebrafish by cooverexpression of Cdc6 and c-Myc to study their
oncogenic mechanisms through the observation on an
early onset and visible transformation on the outmost skin
layer. To generate the transgenic zebrafish model, we used
tol2 transposon tool to overexpress cdc6 and c-myc in
epidermis driven by a skin-specific krt4 promoter. Here
we successfully created the stable zebrafish transgenics
carrying cdc6 and c-myc. Furthermore, we investigated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the underlying mechanism of cellular transformation
triggered by co-overexpression of Cdc6 and c-Myc using
a transgenic zebrafish skin model, which is involved in
accelerated cell proliferation, apoptosis attenuation,
genomic instability, and EMT.

RESULTS
Single overexpression of cdc6 or c-myc is not
sufficient to oncogenic transformation of zebrafish
skin
To address the role of interaction between Cdc6
and c-Myc in tumorigenesis in vivo, we chose zebrafish
as a model to study multiple-oncogenic transformation
on the zebrafish skin. To determine the gain-of-function
of Cdc6 and/or c-Myc on epidermal transformation
in zebrafish, we constitutively overexpressed human
cdc6 (hcdc6) and mouse c-myc T58A (m.c-myc T58A)
genes in epidermis under the control of keratin4 (krt4)
promoter (Fig. S1A). The cmlc2-EGFP-pA mini-cassette
encodes a cytoplasmic-targeted EGFP, being a reporter
for identification of transgenics. We successfully isolated
four lines carrying cdc6 (germ-line transmission rate
= 7%) and 28 lines carrying c-myc (61%). Among all
lines, Tg(krt4:hcdc6)cy24 and Tg(krt4: m.c-myc T58A)cy21
displayed the most strongest green fluorescence in the
heart and were kept for the following experiments. We
used genotyping to identify stable krt4-cdc6 or c-myc
expression according to positive genomic PCR results in
the F1 transgenic progeny (Fig. S1A).
However, we were unable to observe any
oncogenic transformation on skin when either cdc6
or c-myc transgene was overexpressed. To clarify this
observation, we sought to compare the density of skin
cell between transgenics and WT. To quantitate skin
density, Tg(krt4:hcdc6)cy24 and Tg(krt4: m.c-myc T58A)
cy21
were crossed with Tg(krt4:nlsEGFP)cy34, and the
number of EGFP-positive skin cell nucleus in the trunk
region was counted. The EGFP-positive cells enable us
to calculate the skin cell number and density in a single
cell resolution. We evaluated the skin cell density and
morphology on embryos aged 3 day post-fertilization
(dpf). Results showed that when cdc6 was overexpressed,
there is no significant difference of skin cell density
between WT (1868±154 mm-2) and Tg(krt4: krt4:hcdc6)
cy24
(1850±211 mm-2) (Figs. 1A, B, and D). However,
c-myc overexpression significantly increased the skin
density (3169±312 mm-2) compared with WT (1868±154
mm-2) (Figs. 1A, C, and D). We next observed the skin
morphology at histological level by using plastic section
through the yolk sac region. We found that the skin of
Tg(krt4: m.c-myc T58A)cy21 (7.7±1.2 µm) is significantly
thinner than WT (11.6±1.5 µm) and Tg(krt4: krt4:hcdc6)

results clearly suggested that neither Cdc6 nor c-Myc
overexpression only is sufficient to transform zebrafish
skin although c-Myc induces skin hyperplasia.

with skin tumor phenotype were lethal and not survived
longer than 15 dpf. Why is pectoral fin region so sensitive
to skin tumor-like transformation? We hypothesized that
the cell proliferative kinetics in the pectoral fin is much
faster than the one in other tissue compartments. To prove
this hypothesis, we performed BrdU incorporation (S
phase marker) and pHistone3 staining (M phase marker)
on cdc6/c-myc transgenics aged 8 dpf. Results support
our speculation since the robust BrdU- or pH3-positive
cells were observed in largely the domain of pectoral fin
(Fig. S2A-D). In addition to the pectoral fin, we found
that the anal and tail fins are a hot spot for active skin cell
proliferation (Fig. S2E).

Co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc induces
tumor-like transformation in zebrafish skin
The failure to transform zebrafish skin in
Tg(krt4:hcdc6)cy24 and Tg(krt4: m.c-mycT58A)cy21 leads
us to test whether co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc
transforms zebrafish skin. The skin out-looking of
progenies derived from either single or double transgenic
line with nlsEGFP background was monitored by using
the fish aged from 3 to 12 dpf. After examining skin
morphology and histology, we were unable to detect any
sign of skin oncogenic transformation in WT (Figs. 2A,
E, I), cdc6 (Figs. 2B, F, J), or c-myc single transgenic
lines at 12 dpf (Figs. 2C, G, K). However, about 15%
progenies derived from cdc6 and c-myc double transgenic
lines displayed tumor-like protruding structure on the
skin surface (especially on the pectoral fin) from at only
8 dpf (Figs. 2D, H, L, S1B). In addition, all progenies

Co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc induces skin
hyperplasia by increasing cell proliferation and
attenuating apoptosis
The intriguing oncogenic transformation phenotype
in the skin of cdc6/c-myc double transgenics leads us to
ask whether this is caused by acceleration of cell cycle
and attenuation of cell death. High magnification view of
the anal and tail fins showed that skin cells are aggregated

in the fin fold regions of cdc6/c-myc transgenics (e to
h in Fig. 3A), while those in the WT fish are deposited
in an organized order (a to d in Fig. 3A). By using antiGFP (krt4-positive cells) and anti-CENPF (cell nucleus
labeling) double staining, krt4-positive cells were
observed in the entire region of fin fold in cdc6/c-myc
transgenic embryos (h in Fig. 3A), which might be caused
by the migration of the cells from lateral epidermis to fin
folds. However, in the wild-type embryos, we found that
krt4-positive cells were only partially distributed in the
fin fold region but never observed in the marginal region
of the same area (d in Fig. 3A). To confirm active cell
proliferation in skin cells from cdc6/c-myc transgenics
at molecular level, we examined the gene expression of
cell cycle-related markers. Results showed that cyclin
D (ccnd1), cyclin E (ccne), cyclin G1 (ccng1), cyclindependent kinase 1 (cdk1), and CDK 2 (cdk2) were
upregulated, while CDK inhibitor 1a (cdkn1a, p21/WAF1)
was downregulated in the cdc6/c-myc transgenics (Fig.
3B). In addition, we noticed that the expression level
of p-RPS6, a marker for protein translation, was highly

upregulated in cdc6/c-myc lines, suggesting that protein
synthesis is highly active in cdc6/c-myc transgenic
fish (Fig. 3C). We next further quantitated the skin cell
proliferation in either WT or double transgenics aged 8dpf
by BrdU incorporation using an image-based cytometry.
Results showed that the cell proliferation activity in cdc6/
c-myc transgenics was much higher than the one in WT
(Fig. 4A, B, G and S3). For example, a high magnification
view in the ventral fin region showed that the BrdUpositive cells in cdc6/c-myc double transgenics were
higher as 13 folds than the ones in WT (Fig. 4C and D).
We concluded that co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc
in zebrafish skin greatly accelerates cell proliferation.
To address apoptosis attenuation, we performed a
whole-mount fluorescent TUNEL staining using 8dpf
aged embryos of either WT or double transgenics. Results
showed that physiological amounts of apoptotic cells were
observed in the anal fin margins of WT (Fig. 4E) but not
in cdc6/c-myc transgenics whose apoptotic cells were
significantly abolished (Fig. 4F and H). Taken together,
we concluded that co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc in

incorporation experiment was conducted to compare the cell proliferation index between WT (A and C) and cdc6/c-myc double transgenic

at 8 dpf and proceed for anti-BrdU antibody staining. The images highlighted by dotted lines in the ventral fin (A and B) were magnified
in C and D, which show the cell patterns with positive BrdU-labeling. The area of BrdU + cells was quantified by image J software and
statistically presented in (G) for comparison. Scale bar =20 µm in C and D. The TUNEL assay was conducted to compare the apoptotic
index between WT (E) and cdc6/c-myc double transgenic fish (F).The area of TUNEL+ cells was quantified by image J software and

transgenics. Compared to WT, the nucleus morphology of
cdc6/c-myc fish displays severe abnormality (Fig. 5A and
B). By measuring the nuclear size of the skin cells, nuclear
pleomorphism was detected in cdc6/c-myc transgenics. In
WT, the nuclear size displays normal distribution pattern
with an average nuclear size at 31±3 µm2. However, only
in cdc6/c-myc transgenics, some macronucleoli (nuclear
size larger than 100 µm2) and micronucleus (nuclear size
smaller than 10 µm2) were detected (Fig. 5C and D).
The nuclear atypia phenotype detected in cdc6/
c-myc transgenic embryos strongly suggests it may
accompany with genomic instability problem. To validate
this hypothesis, we performed image-based cytometry and

Detection of nuclear aberration and genomic
instability in cdc6/c-myc double transgenics

[5, 6, 9, 25]. To examine the transformation phenotype in
zebrafish skin, we performed plastic section through the

array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH)
to detect the DNA content and chromosome stability of the
transformed skin, respectively. For DNA content analysis,
cdc6/c-myc transgenic embryo cells with H2AFZmCherry background aged 8dpf were gently dissociated,
stained with Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye, and then
subjected to image-based cytometry. For WT, both the skin
and non-skin cell fractions display normal DNA content
histogram (Fig. 5E and G). However, in cdc6/c-myc
transgenic embryos, skin cells display typical polyploidy
that is characterized with abnormal accumulation of 8N
fractions (Fig. 5F and G). To further confirm genome
instability in the zebrafish skin cells, we isolated genomic
DNA from WT and cdc6/c-myc transgenic embryos
aged 8 dpf, labeling genomic DNA with Cy3 and Cy5
dyes. The genomic DNA then was subjected to perform
aCGH analysis with zebrafish 385K CGH microarray.
Results showed that cdc6/c-myc transgenic embryos have
abnormal subchromosomal amplification in Chromosome
10 and 22 (Fig. 5H).
To confirm the phenomenon of polyploidy observed
in the zebrafish model, we tried to co-overexpress Cdc6
and c-Myc in human cells. After infecting cells with
recombinant adenoviruses (Ad-Cdc6 or Ad-Cdt1),
rereplication was monitored by accumulation of cells

containing more than 4N DNA content as described
[26], which presents a form of replication stress, fuelling
polyploidy and genomic instability. Co-overexpression
of Cdc6 with c-Myc or Cdt1 significantly induced DNA
rereplication (Fig. 5I). These results support the idea that
co-overexpression of cdc6 and c-myc induces polyploidy
and genomic instability, hallmarks of malignant
tumorigenesis.

Detection of ectopic skin cells and EMT in cdc6/cmyc double transgenics
To provide more evidences to support the skin
transformation phenotype, we performed plastic section
through the tumor-like tissue in the pectoral fin of cdc6/cmyc transgenics. In the section crossing pectoral fin of WT
with nlsEGFP-positive background, we found the EGFPpositive skin nucleus is flat and restrictedly located on the
superficial layer (a in Fig. 6A). Intriguingly, some ectopic
EGFP-positive skin cells were detected in the internal
location of the pectoral fin of cdc6/c-myc transgenics (d
in Fig. 6A, highlighted by yellow stars).
In addition, severe disorganization of the muscle
and cartilage layers was also noticed in cdc6/c-myc

zebrafish and in human cancer cells. (A). The skin cells of WT (a-c) and cdc6/c-myc double transgenics (d-f) aged 8 dpf were labeled
by nlsEGFP (green color) and co-staining with Hoechst 33342 nuclear dye in the pectoral fin sections. In normal fish, skin cells were
restrictedly located in the outmost layer (a, c). However, some ectopic nlsEGFP+ cells (indicted by asterisks) were mixed with the inner
cartilage tissues (d, f). (B) Real-time PCR results showed the epidermal markers of keratin gene family were significantly downregulated in

experiments. (E). Summary of the phenotype detected in cdc6/c-myc double transgenic fish. EMT, epithelial to mesenchymal transition.

transgenics (e in Fig. 6A). In many types of cancer, EMT
transformation featured by down-regulation of epithelial
markers and up-regulation of mesenchymal makers
is frequently detectable and strongly associated with
cancer malignancy [27]. The disorganization of skin cell
distribution and the appearance of ectopic skin cells may
suggest that the transformed skin cells are undergoing
EMT. To clarify this speculation, we examined the mRNA
expression profile of key genes related to EMT by realtime RT-PCR on embryos aged 8 dpf. Results showed
that most epithelial markers, E-cadherin (cdh1) and type
I keratin (cki, cyt1, krt17, krt18) and type II keratin (krt5,
krt8, krtt2c6, and krtt2c8), were downregulated in cdc6/
c-myc lines (Fig. 6B). In contrast, mesenchymal gene
transcripts of mmp9, snail1a, snail1b, snail2, twist1a, and
twist1b were significantly upregulated in cdc6/c-myc lines
(Fig. 6C). We further confirmed this EMT phenomenon
by immunofluorescent staining. Agreed with mRNA
expression, the relative expression level of epithelial
markers of cytokeratin 8 (CK8) and cytokeratin 13 (CK13)
was robust expressed in WT while they were barely
detected in cdc6/c-myc lines (a and b in Fig. 6D). Again,
the mesenchymal maker MMP9 was highly expressed in
cdc6/c-myc lines but not in WT (c and f in Fig. 6D). These
results strongly suggest that co-overexpression of cdc6
and c-myc in zebrafish skin induces EMT, a hallmark of
malignant invasion and metastasis in human cancer.

onwards even in the WT fish with a normal p53 expression
background. This cdc6/c-myc transgenic line will be an
excellent experimental animal model and an anti-cancer
drug screening platform for identifying the potent c-Myc
or Cdc6 inhibitor.
Our findings suggested that c-Myc only is able to
induce skin hyperplasia but not sufficient to transform
zebrafish skin. c-Myc is a transcription factor that
directly modulates transcription of a large number of
genes involved in cell cycle regulation, protein synthesis,
metabolism, DDR, and apoptosis [29, 30]. The profound
functions of c-Myc in tumorigenesis have been mainly
attributed to its ability to coordinate transcription. In
addition, deregulated expression of c-Myc leads to the
generation of double strand breaks (DSBs), DDR and thus
promotes genome instability [31]. Therefore, we suggest
the reason of the failure of skin transformation induced by
c-Myc overexpression only may be that cell transformation
induced by oncogenic activation is restrained by cell cycle
arrest, cellular senescence, and apoptosis, just like ras and
mos [11, 12].
Next we found that co-overexpression of cdc6 and
c-myc induces tumor-like transformation in zebrafish skin.
The mechanisms could be increased cell proliferation,
apoptosis attenuation, and the effect of genomic instability.
Several explanations have been proposed to elucidate the
phenomenon of genomic instability triggered by c-Myc
overexpression, including inducing DNA replication stress
[9, 32, 33], inhibiting DNA repair activities [34], and
increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
[25]. In addition, a recent study has identified a different
mechanism for c-Myc in the direct stimulation of DNA
replication, independent of its transcriptional targets.
c-Myc is able to bind to components of the pre-RC,
including Cdc6, and bind to known mammalian replication
origins [9]. The genetic interaction between c-Myc and
Cdc6 observed in the double transgenic zebrafish could
be elucidated as the following. First, c-Myc and Cdc6
overexpression may enhance replication stress through
both transcription-dependent and -independent function
of c-Myc. Our results support the oncogenic potential
of overexpressed c-Myc and Cdc6 from the earliest
stages of skin transformation, which may be achieved
by active replication stress. Initially, the stress activates
the antitumor barriers of senescence or apoptosis (Myc
or Cdc6 overexpression only), but the barriers eventually
are bypassed by the continuous co-overexpression of
c-Myc and Cdc6, which induces genomic instability
favoring clonal expansion of cells with more aggressive
properties. Second, Cdc6 overexpression may regulate
the switch between the transcription-dependent and
-independent function of c-Myc, as a study [13] showed
that Cdc6 overexpression interferes with the interaction
between c-Myc and Max, which inhibits E-boxdependent transcription activity of c-Myc. Third, Cdc6
overexpression may increase replication efficiency and

DISCUSSION
In this work, we established a novel non-melanoma
skin cancer model in zebrafish to study the oncogenic
mechanisms of Cdc6 and c-Myc by co-overexpression of
both in the outmost skin layer, rendering the practicability
in a good cancer model and anti-cancer drug screening.
Our studies suggest that co-overexpression of Cdc6 and
c-Myc in zebrafish skin causes skin transformation through
accelerated cell proliferation, apoptosis attenuation,
genomic instability, and EMT (Fig. 6E).
In this study, we successfully created an early onset
and a non-melanoma skin cancer model by specifically cooverexpressing two oncogenic genes that cause unbalance
of cell cycle progression. Skin is the outmost tissue
and provides a good model to evaluate the oncogenic
transformation in living animal in a non-invasive manner.
In addition, the outmost nature also makes it is easy to
evaluate the biological effect of anti-cancer compound
against cancer. In zebrafish, although many studies were
attempting to induce skin cancer formation, no successful
case was found in any skin cancer models except only in
melanoma model [28]. Since we were failed to transform
zebrafish skin cells by overexpression of single oncogene,
we then tried to co-express two oncogenes to overcome
the refractory threshold in zebrafish skin. Using cooverexpression of cdc6 and c-myc, we can induce
tumor-like formation on the skin as early as from 8 dpf

Genetex). After extensive washing in PBST for 10 min,
embryos were incubated with 1:500 diluted Alexa Fluor
488 or 568-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen)
for fluorescent detection of immunoreactive signals. For
histology, some stained embryos were further infiltrated
and embedded in Technovit 7100 resin (Heraeus Kulzer).
Samples were sectioned at 3 μm intervals and counterstain with either Hoechst 33342 (Invitrogen) or SYTOX

gene expression of c-myc gene because a recent study
showed that Cdc6 is increased its binding to the replication
origins of c-myc, and the binding augments the origin
activity [35].
Intriguingly, we observed that co-overexpression
of cdc6 and c-myc induces EMT in zebrafish skin.
Consistently, in cdc6/c-myc transgenic lines, the gene
expression of epithelial markers, E-cadherin and
cytokeratin, were downregulated; the gene expression
of mesenchymal markers, MMP9, Snail, Twist1 were
significantly upregulated. This result is supported by
the finding that overexpressed Cdc6 binds directly to
the E-boxes of the Cdh1 promoter and represses its
transcription [14].

Real-time quantitative PCR
Ten zebrafish larvae aged at 8 dpf from wild-type or
double transgenic lines were collected and homogenized
in RNAzol RT (RN190, MRC, Inc) with Bullet Blender
(Next Advance, Inc) tissue lyser to isolate total RNA
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total RNA
concentration was determined by spectrophotometry,
and the RNA quality was checked by electrophoresis in
RNA denatured gels. For RT-PCR, 1 μg of total RNA was
reverse-transcribed with RevertAid first cDNA synthesis
kit (K1622, Fermentas) and then PCR was performed
with SYBR green dye according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. The PCR condition: 95°C (15 s), 60°C (1
min), 72°C (1 min) for 40 cycles, and all reactions were
started at 95°C for 5 min and terminated at 72°C for 5 min.
The primer sequences used to perform RT-qPCR and the
PCR amplicon size are listed in Table S1.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fish lines and plasmid construction
The detailed procedure for fish lines and plasmid
construction used in this study have been described in
previous publication [36] and in Supplementary Data.

Image Acquisition, Skin Cell Quantification and
Statistics
Representative fluorescent images were acquired
using an upright microscope (BX51, Olympus) equipped
with a digital camera (DP72, Olympus) or a dissecting
microscope (SMZ1500, Nikon) equipped with a cool CCD
(Evolution VF). For quantifying the relative density of skin
cells, the original images captured at the trunk position
were processed using Photoshop CS3 software to select a
region of interest (ROI) at 150 µm x 450 m dimensions.
The total cell number in this ROI was calculated using
ImageJ software and statistically compared using t-test or
one-way ANOVA.

BrdU Incorporation
Zebrafish embryos aged 7 dpf were systematically
incubated in 10 mM BrdU (B5002, Sigma)/5 % DMSO/
PTU solution for 24 hr. After fixation, embryos aged 8
dpf were depurated with 2 N HCl for 60 min at room
temperature and immersed in 0.1M borate buffer for 10
min to enhance the sensitivity for detection of the BrdUpositive cells in skin. Later, embryos were subjected to
staining with mouse anti-BrdU antibody (1:100, G3G4,
DSHB) and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse
secondary antibody (Invitrogen).

Whole-Mount Immunostaining and Histology
Zebrafish embryos aged specific developmental
stages were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde/PBS for 12
h at 4°C. After extensive washing in PBST, embryos
were transferred to 100 % methanol at -20°C for 2h and
subsequently subjected to rehydration with PBST. After
blocking with 3 % BSA/PBST at room temperature for 60
min, embryos were incubated at 4°C overnight with 1:200
diluted primary antibodies as follows: rabbit anti-pH3 (sc8656-R, Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-human phosphorylated
ribosomal Protein S6 (Ser235/236) (GTX113542,
GeneTex), rabbit anti-human CK8 (GTX110311,
Genetex), rabbit anti-human CK13 (GTX109883,
Genetex), rabbit anti-human MMP9 (GTX100626,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

TUNEL assay
For TUNEL assay, embryos aged 18 hour postfertilization (hpf) were pre-treated with PTU and then
processed to PFA fixation at 48 hpf. Following washing
in PBST for 10 min they were then stored in 100 %
methanol at -20°C for over 2h. Embryos were incubated
with 3 % H2O2/MeOH for 10 min at room temperature.
Subsequently, embryos were rinsed two times with PBS
and incubated with labeling solution, 10μL of enzyme
solution plus 90μL of label solution at 37°C for 2h

following the kit instructions (Roche Applied Sciences).
Embryos were then washed three times in PBS, for
5 min each time, at room temperature. Subsequently,
embryos were incubated with 100μL of converter POD
at 37°C for 30 min. Embryos were rinsed three times in
PBS and incubated with DAB solution (SK-4100, Vector
Laboratories) for 5 min.

Kit and NimbleGen Hybridization system to provide an
active mixing action for 48hrs and constant incubation
temperature at 42°C. The hybridization result was scanned
with NimbleGen MS200 microarray scanner automatically
taking optimized signal in 2µm pixel resolution and the
relative fluorescent intensity was normalized, converted
to log2 scale by NimbleScan software. The segmented
CGH data were generated by CGH-segMNT analysis of
NimbleScan software.

Image-based cytometry

Adenovirus construction and infection

To facilitate skin cell counting, WT or cdc6+c-myc
double transgenics were crossed with Tg(krt4:mCherry)
cy9
. To enhance the detection sensitivity and reduce the
total amount of embryos used to analysis the cell cycle
and DNA content, we adapted an imaged-based cytometry
approach by using NucleoCounter NC-3000 FlexiCyte
machine (Chemometec, Denmark). Initially, ten embryos
aged 8 dpf were slightly fixed in 4%PFA for 20 min at
room temperature and then dissociated with 250 uL
lysis buffer at 37oC for 10 min. The cell lysate was later
incubated with 250 uL stabilization buffer to neutralize the
pH value. After this cell dissociation process, the mCherry
fluorescence is gone and we performed immunofluorescent
staining with rabbit anti-mCherry primary antibody
(1:200, GTX5788, Genetex) and goat anti-rabbit IgGAlexa Flour 568-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500,
Invitrogen) to recover the skin fluorescence. Finally,
all dissociated cells were counter-stained with Hoechst
33342 (H1399, Invitrogen) at 5 ppm concentration at
37C for 1 hr to illuminate cell nucleus and then loaded
onto chamber slide (NC-Slide A2) for taking images. The
DNA content and cell cycle were analyzed Nucleoview
NC-3000 software according to manufactory instruction
(Chemometec, Denmark).

Adenoviruses encoding GFP (Ad-Vec), human
Cdc6 (Ad-Cdc6) and Cdt1 (Ad-Cdt1) were generated and
purified by using the AdEasy system [38] and as described
previously [39]. Large-scale purification of adenovirus
from 293 cells was performed by CsCl density gradient
centrifugation. The concentration of purified virus was
measured OD260 using the equation 1OD260 ≈ 1012 pfu [40].
The detailed procedures for cell culture and
microinjection and identification of transgenic Zebrafish
used in this study are described in Supplementary Data.
