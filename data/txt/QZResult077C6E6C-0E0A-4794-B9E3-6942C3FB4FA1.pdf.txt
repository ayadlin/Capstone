Abstract
The Hsp90 facilitates proper folding of signaling proteins
associated with cancer progression, gaining attention as a target
for therapeutic intervention. The natural rotenoid deguelin was
identiﬁed as an Hsp90 inhibitor, but concerns about neurotoxicity have limited prospects for clinical development. In this
study, we report progress on deguelin analogues that address
this limitation, focusing on the novel analogue SH-1242
as a candidate to broadly target human lung cancer cells,
including those that are chemoresistant or harboring KRAS
mutations. In a KRAS-driven mouse model of lung cancer,
SH-1242 administration reduced tumor multiplicity, volume,
and load. Similarly, in human cell line–based or patientderived tumor xenograft models, SH-1242 induced apoptosis

Introduction
Numerous proteins involved in tumor signaling networks
depend on the 90-kDa Hsp90 to mediate cell proliferation and
survival (1, 2). Thus, Hsp90 inhibition has been proposed to
target client proteins associated with hallmarks of cancer (3) and
to overcome resistance to conventional or targeted anticancer
agents (4–6). Several natural, synthetic, and semisynthetic Hsp90
inhibitors with various structural backbones, such as radicicol (7),

and reduced tumor vasculature in the absence of detectable
toxicity. In contrast to deguelin, SH-1242 toxicity was greatly
reduced in normal cells and when administered to rats did
not produce obvious histopathologic features in the brain.
Mechanistic studies revealed that SH-1242 bound to the Cterminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90, disrupting the ability to
interact with its co-chaperones and clients and triggering
a degradation of client proteins without affecting Hsp70
expression. Taken together, our ﬁndings illustrate the superior properties of SH-1242 as an Hsp90 inhibitor and as
an effective antitumor and minimally toxic agent, providing a
foundation for advancing further preclinical and clinical studies.

retaspimycin (IPI-504), ganetespib (STA-9090), and luminespib
(NVP-AUY922, VER52296), have shown potent antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo (8). Some of these compounds are currently
being evaluated in clinical trials in cancer patients. Most of Hsp90
inhibitors bind to the N-terminal ATP-binding domain (2, 8) and
show a propensity for inducing a heat shock response (HSR) that
ultimately leads to increases in Hsp90 and antiapoptotic proteins,
such as Hsp70 and Hsp27 (9, 10). Therefore, several groups have
attempted to develop speciﬁc C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors as an
alternative strategy for the development of clinically applicable
Hsp90 inhibitors. Several C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors, including
novobiocin (2, 11) and cisplatin (12), have demonstrated an
antiproliferative effect and, in some cases, apoptotic activities
without eliciting a HSR (2, 13). Although relatively low potency of
novobiocin was an obstacle to further clinical usage, several
novobiocin analogues with improved efﬁcacy have been synthesized (14, 15). In addition to these recent development of several
Hsp90 inhibitors with improved efﬁcacy and reduced toxicity
(14, 16), procurement of additional chemical entity of safe and
efﬁcacious Hsp90 inhibitor would be also required considering
the important roles of Hsp90 in cancer biology.
Phytochemical compounds have shown of promise as anticancer drugs against a variety of cancers (17). We and others have
demonstrated that a naturally occurring rotenoid deguelin has
potent anticancer activities by disrupting ATP binding to Hsp90
and thus destabilizing its client proteins, such as Akt and HIF1a
(18–24). However, despite deguelin's potency, its potential

A Novel C-Terminal Hsp90 Inhibitor SH-1242

Parkinsonism-like neurotoxicity may be an obstacle to further
clinical development. Hence, we have synthesized a variety of
deguelin analogues; of these, SH-1242, a B- and C-ring truncated
analogue (25), displayed a potent antiproliferative effect against
human cancer cells (25) and suppressed hypoxia-mediated retinal
neovascularization and vascular leakage in diabetic retinas by
suppressing hypoxia-mediated upregulation of HIF1a and VEGF
expression without any obvious toxicity (26). These promising
effects imply the potential of SH-1242 as a lead candidate for
developing Hsp90 inhibitors.
Here, we demonstrate the preclinical evidence of potent antitumor effects of SH-1242 with signiﬁcantly reduced toxicity.
SH-1242 has broad antitumor and antiangiogenic activities
in various therapy-na€ve and drug-resistant non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and in clinically relevant experimental models, including Kras transgenic mice and patientderived xenograft tumors (PDX). In addition, SH-1242 displayed signiﬁcantly reduced toxic effects on various normal
cells and showed no obvious Parkinsonism-like toxicity in
the rat brain compared with deguelin. Furthermore, SH-1242
effectively disrupted Hsp90 function by interacting with its
C-terminal domain, thereby leading to degradation of its
client proteins without Hsp70 induction. Collectively, these
results suggest that SH-1242 is a novel C-terminal Hsp90
inhibitor and has broad application against various cancers in
the ﬁrst- and second-line treatment.

Materials and Methods
Additional or detailed methods are described in the Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Synthesis of SH-1242
Detailed procedure for synthesis of SH-1242 is described in our
previous report (25).
Cell culture
H1299, H460, H292, and BEAS-2B cells were purchased from
the ATCC. The other NSCLC cells were kindly provided by Dr.
John V. Heymach (MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX).
HUVECs were purchased from Invitrogen. Human bronchial
epithelial (HBE) cells were kindly provided by Dr. John Minna
(The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas,
TX). Human retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells were kindly
provided by Dr. Jeong Hun Kim (College of Medicine, Seoul
National University, Seoul, Republic of Korea). HT-22 cells were
provided by Dr. Dong Gyu Jo (College of Pharmacy, Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, Republic of Korea). Cell lines were
authenticated and validated at the Korean Cell Line Bank using
AmplFLSTR identiﬁer PCR Ampliﬁcation Kit (Applied Biosystems; cat. No. 4322288) in 2013. Cells passed for fewer than 6
months after receipt or resuscitation of validated cells were used in
this study.
Immunoprecipitation and pull-down assay
The following assays were performed following procedures
described in our previous report (24): immunoprecipitation,
puriﬁcation of Hsp90 proteins, and a pull-down assay to identify
the competitive ATP-binding pocket using ATP-agarose (Innova
Biosciences) and the binding of biotinylated SH-1242 to each

www.aacrjournals.org

domain of Hsp90 in the presence or absence of a known Hsp90
inhibitor.
Animal studies
All animal procedures were performed according to a protocol
approved by the Seoul National University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (approval numbers SNU-121207-2 and
SNU-130820-6). For xenograft and PDX experiments, the tumorbearing mice were treated with treated with vehicle (10% DMSO
in corn oil), SH-1242 (4 or 20 mg/kg), deguelin (4 mg/kg),
or geldanamycin (4 mg/kg) by oral gavage (for H292 xenografts)
or intraperitoneal injection (for H1299 xenografts and PDX)
six times per week for 3 weeks. In the experiment using Kras
transgenic mice, vehicle or SH-1242 was administered by intraperitoneal injection (20 mg/kg) once a day for 8 weeks. To
examine the parkinsonism-like neurotoxic effects of SH-1242
and deguelin, 8- to 10-week old Sprague–Dawley rats were treated
with SH-1242 or deguelin (4 mg/kg, dissolved in corn oil) by oral
gavage every day for 20 days.
IHC and immunoﬂuorescence
IHC and immunoﬂuorescence analyses to detect CD31 and
cleaved caspase-3 expression in the tumors and to evaluate
tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the rat brain were
performed as previously described (24).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as the mean  SD. Data were calculated with
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp.) or GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software Inc.). The statistical signiﬁcance of in vitro or in vivo
data was determined using either two-sided Student t test or
ANOVA followed by Dunnett post hoc test. Unless otherwise
indicated, statistical signiﬁcance was determined by comparison
with vehicle-treated control. A P value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically signiﬁcant.

Results
SH-1242 displays potent antiproliferative and antiangiogenic
activities in several types of human cancer cells
On the basis of the established structure–activity relationship
(SAR) of deguelin, we synthesized a series of potent deguelin
analogues to identify a novel anticancer drug targeting Hsp90
(25). Among these compounds, we chose SH-1242, a B- and Cring truncated analogue (Supplementary Fig. S1). SH-1242
displayed potent inhibitory effects on HIF1a expression and
viability of H1299 human NSCLC cells and on hypoxia-mediated retinal neovascularization and vascular leakage in a diabetic retina without developmental defects in zebraﬁsh embryos (25, 26). We ﬁrst assessed the potency of SH-1242 against
various human NSCLC cell lines. Considering the clinical
utility of targeted anticancer drugs as a second-line therapy,
we included several cancer sublines (designated "/R") with
acquired resistance to anticancer therapeutics, including the
chemotherapeutic drug paclitaxel (H226B/R and H460/R), the
EGFR TKI geﬁtinib (PC9/GR), and the IGF1R TKI linsitinib
(H292/R; Supplementary Table S1). SH-1242 signiﬁcantly
inhibited the viability of the drug-na€ve as well as the drugresistant sublines (Supplementary Fig. S2). SH-1242 also
showed signiﬁcant inhibitory effects on anchorage-dependent
(Fig. 1A) and anchorage-independent (Fig. 1B) colony-forming

A Novel C-Terminal Hsp90 Inhibitor SH-1242

abilities of both na€ve and their drug-resistant sublines. These
cell lines underwent apoptosis after the treatment with SH1242, as evidenced by increased cleavage of caspase-3 and its
substrate PARP (Fig. 1C) and by an increased distribution of the
cell population in the sub-G0–G1 phase (Fig. 1D). Because Hsp90
inhibitors that block the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket induce
cytoprotective Hsp70 expression (9, 10), we also examined the
effects of SH-1242 on Hsp70 induction. However, Hsp70 expression remained unchanged or slightly decreased by treatment with
SH-1242 (Fig. 1C).
It is known that alterations in cellular redox status can affect
cell fates, including cell proliferation, growth, and death (27).
Interestingly, a recent study suggested that deguelin induces
apoptosis of lung cancer cells via ROS-induced Akt dephosphorylation (28). To conﬁrm whether this mechanism could be
associated with the proapoptotic effect of SH-1242, NSCLC
cells were treated with SH-1242, alone or in combination, with
an antioxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Consistent with previous ﬁndings, treatment with SH-1242 markedly suppressed
the phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3b and induced PARP
cleavage. However, treatment with NAC in combination only
partially reversed these SH-1242's effects in H1299 cells and
displayed no obvious effects in H226B and H226B/R cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3). These results suggest that the effect
of SH-1242 on the Akt dephosphorylation and apoptosis
induction appears to be unrelated to ROS generation, which
is consistent with our previous ﬁndings on the ROS-independent HIF regulation by deguelin (24).
Because Ras mediates the signal transduction from growth
factor receptors to downstream mediators, many (e.g., Raf and
MEK) of which are clients of Hsp90 (29, 30), and Ras mutations
are involved in resistance to various anticancer drugs (31, 32), we
next tested the effects of SH-1242 on cancer cells harboring
mutant KRAS. As shown in Fig. 1E, SH-1242 exhibited signiﬁcant
and comparable inhibitory effect on the anchorage-independent
colony formation of mutant KRAS–overexpressing H226B
(H226B/KRAS) cells; this inhibitory effect of SH-1242 was comparable with its effect on parental H226B cells carrying wild-type
KRAS.
On the basis of the potent antiangiogenic effects of deguelin
and its derivatives (23, 26), we further assessed the effect of
SH-1242 on angiogenic activities of NSCLC cells. Because
tumor angiogenesis is mediated at least in part by tumorsecreted angiogenic growth factors that interact with their
surface receptors expressed on endothelial cells (33), we analyzed the effects of conditioned medium (CM) derived from
H1299 cells treated with increasing concentrations of SH-1242
on the tube formation of HUVECs. HUVECs incubated with
the conditioned medium (CM) derived from H1299 cells,
which had been treated with SH-1242 under normoxic or
hypoxic conditions, formed signiﬁcantly fewer tubes than did
those treated with CM from untreated H1299 cells (Fig. 1F).
Collectively, these results demonstrate the broad anticancer
activities of SH-1242.
Anticancer effect of SH-1242 on the growth of KRAS–driven
spontaneous lung tumors and NSCLC cell line- and patientderived xenograft tumors
Because conventional cancer cell lines can adapt to artiﬁcial
in vitro culture conditions and the interaction of tumor cells
with stromal components supports cancer cell survival (34),

www.aacrjournals.org

we explored whether SH-1242 suppresses lung tumor growth
in vivo using Kras transgenic mice that develop spontaneous
lung tumors with a 100% incidence (35). We ﬁrst tested
effective doses of SH-1242 by performing dose determining
experiments using a NSCLC xenograft tumor model. We found
that intraperitoneal treatment with SH-1242 at the dose
of 20 mg/kg had signiﬁcant antitumor activities without
detectable toxicities. Hence, we chose this treatment schedule.
Difference in the tumor growth was monitored by microcomputed tomography (Fig. 2A, a) and ﬂuorescence-based
image analyses (Fig. 2A, b; refs. 21, 36). Two representative
mice showed markedly decreased lung tumor growth by SH1242 treatment. Postmortem examination of the mice revealed
that SH-1242–treated mice had fewer lung tumor nodules
than vehicle-treated mice (Fig. 2A, c and B, left). Microscopic
analysis of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained lung tissues
(Fig. 2A, d) showed signiﬁcantly decreased tumor multiplicity
(Fig. 2B, right), especially tumor nodules bigger than 1 mm3
(Fig. 2C) in SH-1242–treated mice compared with the control
mice. Tumor volume (Fig. 2D) and load (Fig. 2E) in SH1242–treated mice were also signiﬁcantly less compared with
those in the control mice. These data indicate the signiﬁcant
inhibitory effect of SH-1242 on mutant KRAS–driven lung
tumor growth.
We next evaluated the effects of SH-1242 on the growth of
human NSCLC cell–derived xenograft tumors. Compared with
vehicle-treated control tumors, SH-1242–treated H1299
(Fig. 3A) xenograft tumors showed signiﬁcantly reduced
growth. We assured the clinical applicability of SH-1242 by
conﬁrming its signiﬁcant inhibitory effects on the growth of
PDX tumors (Fig. 3B). Because 4 mg/kg deguelin via oral
gavage administration was the maximum tolerated dose, we
additionally chose the treatment schedule (4 mg/kg by oral
gavage) and compared the antitumor effects of SH-1242,
geldanamycin, and deguelin. As illustrated in Fig. 3C, we
observed signiﬁcant antitumor effect of SH-1242, which was
comparable with deguelin and geldanamycin. We further conﬁrmed the effects of SH-1242 on apoptosis and angiogenesis in
vivo by measuring the expression of cleaved caspase-3 (a
marker of apoptosis) and CD31 (a marker of microvessel
formation) in xenograft tumors of H1299 cells and patientderived tissues. We observed that SH-1242 signiﬁcantly
increased cleaved caspase-3 and decreased CD31 expression
in the H1299 and PDX tumors (Fig. 3D and E). During the
treatment period for these three animal experiments, body
weight was not signiﬁcantly different between the control and
SH-1242–treated groups. Moreover, tissue samples obtained
from several organs (liver, lung, heart, kidneys, spleen, urinary
bladder, ovary, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum) of the
SH-1242–treated mice revealed no remarkable histopathologic changes, which is consistent with the lack of major toxic
effects observed in A/J mice after 19 weeks of oral deguelin
administration (twice daily) during a previous study (21).
These overall results suggest that SH-1242 has effective and
clinically applicable antitumor activities with minimal toxicities in NSCLC.
Reduced toxicity proﬁle of SH-1242 compared
with deguelin
A concern on the use of deguelin as an anticancer drug is
potential toxicities. In a previous study, deguelin caused

parkinsonism-like syndrome, which was manifested by
decreased tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the rat
brain (37). In addition, it was reported that Hsp90 inhibitors
may induce ocular and liver toxicity (38). Although it is not
clear whether therapeutic doses of deguelin would induce the
side effects and whether the side effects can be relieved after
drug withdrawal, the potential toxicities of deguelin can be a
considerable obstacle to its clinical use. On the basis of this
notion, we evaluated whether SH-1242 harbors less or no
potential toxicity compared with deguelin. We ﬁrst examined
toxicity of SH-1242 at the cellular levels by testing the effects of

(HUVEC; Fig. 4D). Compared with deguelin, SH-1242 showed
signiﬁcantly reduced cytotoxicity in the tested normal cells
(Fig. 4A–D). We next compared the effects of SH-1242 and
deguelin on tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the
substantial nigra in rats. The tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was signiﬁcantly decreased by deguelin treatment
while it was minimally affected by SH-1242 treatment,

to Hsp90 inhibitors (39–41). Consistent with previous ﬁndings (39, 42), the HLH-PAS-ODD domain of HIF1a interacted
strongly with Hsp90, and this interaction was inhibited by
SH-1242 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). Inhibition of
the Hsp90–HIF1a interaction by SH-1242 was more potent

that SH-1242 more potently inhibits Hsp90 function than did

A Novel C-Terminal Hsp90 Inhibitor SH-1242

ﬁndings suggest that SH-1242 has the capacity to disrupt
Hsp90 function and to decrease expression of Hsp90 client
proteins.
Competitive inhibition of ATP binding to the C-terminal
potential nucleotide-binding pocket of Hsp90 by SH-1242
Hsp90 possesses the ATP-binding pockets in the N-terminal
domain (2, 29). The middle domain plays a role in the regulation of Hsp90 function such as client recognition (29) and
interacts with g-phosphate of ATP bound to the N-terminal ATP
pocket (29, 43). The C-terminal domain of Hsp90 is crucial for
dimerization of Hsp90 (2, 29). Previous reports suggest the
interaction between ATP and the Hsp90 C-terminal domain
(43–45). However, the potential ATP-interacting region in the
Hsp90 C-terminal domain could be a hydrophobic pocket, and
it is largely unknown whether Hsp90 possess structurally
deﬁned C-terminal ATP binding sites with a function. Hence,
additional investigation to prove the structural, functional, and
biochemical aspects of the C-terminal ATP-binding sites are
required. To obtain direct evidence for SH-1242 binding to
Hsp90, recombinant Hsp90 proteins containing the full length
(FL), truncated N-terminal (N), middle (M), and C-terminal (C)
domains were prepared (Fig. 6A, top). We ﬁrst conﬁrmed the
capacity of these Hsp90 domains to ATP by using ATP-agarose
and ATPgS as a competitive agent. The FL, N, M, and C domains
of Hsp90 bound to ATP-agarose, and these interactions were
decreased by coincubation with ATPgS (Fig. 6A, down). Subsequent competition analysis demonstrated that the increasing
amount of the N and, to a lesser extent, C domain gradually
decreased ATP binding to the FL domain, but this effect was not
observed for the M domain of Hsp90 (Fig. 6B). ATP binding to
the N domain was unaffected by increasing the molar ratio of
the C domain, whereas ATP binding to the C domain was
markedly decreased by increasing levels of the N domain. These
results were consistent with previous ﬁndings that the ATPbinding region exists in both the N and C domains of Hsp90
and that the afﬁnity of ATP binding is higher to the Hsp90
N-terminal than to the Hsp90 C-terminal (45).
We next performed ﬂuorescence-based equilibrium binding
experiment to assess whether SH-1242–binding sites are localized
within the N and/or C domains of Hsp90. The calculated Kd value
of SH-1242 binding to FL, N, and C domains of Hsp90 was
obtained by exciting the proteins at 285 nm and monitoring the
emission change at 340 nm. The ﬂuorescence emission spectrum
produced by Hsp90 excited at 258 nm is shown in Fig. 6C. When
Hsp90 proteins were titrated with SH-1242, the emission at 340
nm decreased after ligand binding. SH-1242 binding to Hsp90
proteins was analyzed by monitoring the change in ﬂuorescence
intensity. After saturation of the protein with SH-1242, the
protein ﬂuorescence quenching levels observed at 340 nm were
57.5% (full length), 83.4% (N-terminal domain), and 61.9%
(C-terminal domain). The Kd values for the fragmented N and C
domains were 27.3 mmol/L and 16.4 mmol/L, respectively. Titration of FL Hsp90 with SH-1242 displayed a two-phase binding
curve with Kd values of 13.95 mmol/L and 197.1 mmol/L. We then
assessed the Kd values after blockade of the N-terminal ATP
binding domain of Hsp90 by preincubation with geldanamycin
(GAA). We observed one-phase binding curve with Kd values of
15.7 mmol/L. We next assessed the capacity of SH-1242 to binds
the ATP-interacting region in the N and C domains of Hsp90.
The FL, N, M, and C-domains of Hsp90 were preincubated with

www.aacrjournals.org

SH-1242, and then ATP-agarose resin was added. The ATP
binding to the Hsp90 FL domain was clearly diminished by
treatment with SH-1242 (Fig. 6D). SH-1242 disrupted the
interaction of ATP with the C domain, and, to a much lesser
extent, with the N domain of Hsp90. These results suggest that
SH-1242 binds to both the N and C domains, presumably with
a higher afﬁnity to the C-terminal ATP-interacting region than
to the N-terminal ATP-binding pocket of Hsp90. The difference
between the two Kd values obtained from FL and those
obtained from the fragmented N and C domains also suggests
that the second binding site in FL Hsp90 may become accessible when the ﬁrst site is occupied.
To ensure that SH-1242 is binding to the C-terminal ATPbinding region, the FL and C domains were preincubated with
C-terminal (cisplatin) or N-terminal (geldanamycin) Hsp90
inhibitors, then biotinylated SH-1242 was added. We observed
that preincubation with cisplatin effectively blocked the binding
of SH-1242 to the FL and C domains of Hsp90, whereas
SH-1242 binding to the FL and N domains was moderately
suppressed by incubation with relatively higher concentrations
of geldanamycin (Fig. 6E). Coimmunoprecipitation assays
revealed that SH-1242 blocked the interaction between Hsp90
and Hop, a co-chaperone known to bind to the C domain of
Hsp90 (Fig. 6F; ref. 46). We also compared the effects of SH1242, deguelin, and 17-AAG on Hsp70 protein levels in H1299
cells. Hsp70 expression was increased after 17-AAG treatment,
whereas it remained unchanged by treatment with SH-1242 or
deguelin (Fig. 6G). We further ensured the Hsp90-binding
capacity of SH-1242 in vivo. To this end, biotinylated SH1242 was incubated with H1299 cell lysates and immunoblotted with an anti-Hsp90 antibody. H1299 cell lysates
revealed an obvious Hsp90 binding to biotinylated SH-1242
(Fig. 6H, top). The Hsp90 protein as the result of binding to
SH-1242 and the high and low molecular weight of proteins
that have also come down non-speciﬁcally or as the result of
binding to Hsp90 was also detected by a silver stained gel (Fig.
6H, bottom). Collectively, these results indicate that the inhibitory effect of SH-1242 on Hsp90 function is mediated mainly
by its direct association with the ATP-interacting region in the
Hsp90 C-terminal domain.
Docking modeling of SH-1242 bound to human Hsp90
We evaluated the binding capability of SH-1242 for the site
known as Hsp90 C-terminal nucleotide-binding region by
molecular docking analysis using the Surﬂex-Dock program.
To corroborate the reliability of our homology model of
hHsp90, docking study of Hsp90 C- (EGCG, paclitaxel, novobiocin, and KU135) and N-terminal inhibitors (geldanamycin
and 17-AAG; ref. 47) was conducted. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, the ranking of Surﬂex-Dock binding scores of
SH-1242, deguelin, and the well-known Hsp90 inhibitors are
consistent with the g-phosphate–linked ATP-agarose binding
assay results. All the compounds were docked into the active
site of Hsp90 homodimer, which is positioned in close proximity to the dimerization interface. The cavity involving the

for ATP binding in the C-terminal. The oxygen atom of the
methoxy group forms a hydrogen bond with the side chain
hydroxyl group at Ser677 in chain A, and the oxygen in the
benzopyran ring forms an additional hydrogen bond with the
side-chain amine at Lys615, one of key residues of the ATPbinding region in chain B. The binding pose of SH-1242 is quite
similar to that of an analogous C-terminal inhibitor reported
recently (49). Considering the overall shape of the Hsp90:SH1242 complex (Fig. 7C), SH-1242 was likely to bind the central
region of dimerization in the C-terminal and may stabilize an
open conformation of the Hsp90 homodimer, which inhibits
N-terminal dimerization and suppresses ATP binding to the
active site in the N-terminal of Hsp90. To validate whether the
predicted amino acid residues within the C domain of Hsp90
play a role in ATP binding, we assessed the ATP-agarose binding
assay by using the C domain of Hsp90, in which Glu611,
Lys615, and Ser677 were mutated to valine, glutamine, and
alanine, respectively. Mutation at K615 or S677 almost
completely abolished the Hsp90 binding to ATP-agarose (Fig.
7D), indicating the importance of K615 and S677 within the
Hsp90 C-terminal domain to ATP binding.

Discussion
Extensive efforts have been directed to develop potent anticancer therapies, and molecularly targeted therapies blocking Hsp90

696 Cancer Res; 76(3) February 1, 2016

have raised the hope of developing effective therapeutic strategies.
To date, several clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of Hsp90
inhibitors have been performed (16), and development of several
derivatives of known Hsp90 inhibitors to improve efﬁcacy and
safety has been extensively investigated (15, 16). Consistent with
this notion, the studies reported herein demonstrate that SH1242, an analogue of a naturally occurring deguelin, has promising anticancer activities with minimal toxicities at least in part by
blocking Hsp90's C-terminal function. Our results provide preclinical support for the use of Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors in the
treatment of lung cancer.
Hsp90 plays major roles in cancer progression, tumor angiogenesis, and therapy resistance by functioning as a molecular
chaperone whose association is necessitated for the stability
and function of numerous client oncogenic proteins (1, 2).
Several clinical trials are underway to evaluate the effectiveness
of Hsp90 inhibitors, mainly those that block the N-terminal
ATP pocket (16). Previous reports have indicated that: (i)
Hsp90 presumably has a second C-terminal nucleotide-binding
site; (ii) the nucleotide-binding region in the C-terminus mediates Hsp90 dimerization and is necessary for the close association between the two N-terminals in the ATP-bound state
(50); (iii) Hsp90 dimerization is critical for its chaperone
function and interaction with co-chaperones; (iv) the Hsp90
C-terminal inhibitors minimally cause cytoprotective Hsp70
induction (1, 16). Following these ﬁndings, we hypothesized

A Novel C-Terminal Hsp90 Inhibitor SH-1242

that Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors may offer a novel opportunity
for cancer therapy.
We have demonstrated that deguelin, a rotenoid derived from
natural products, has potent antitumor and antiangiogenic effects
mediated through its interruption of Hsp90 function, thereby
affecting the stability of numerous oncogenic cellular client
proteins, including HIF1a (24). Despite the promising anticancer
efﬁcacy of deguelin in various in vitro and in vivo models, its
widespread use could be hindered by concerns regarding its
potential neurotoxicity (37). We have therefore attempted to
develop potent, but safe, deguelin analogues, and SH-1242 was
found to be one such lead candidate.
Our results in the current study demonstrate that a novel
deguelin analogue, designated SH-1242, offers reasonable efﬁcacy and safety proﬁle by showing the following results, including:
(i) SH-1242 inhibits viability, colony forming abilities, and
angiogenic activity of a panel of NSCLC cell lines and their
sublines that had acquired resistance to chemo- or moleculartargeted therapies. SH-1242 effectively induced apoptosis in these
drug-na€ve and drug-resistant sublines; and (ii) SH-1242 effectively suppressed the growth of lung tumors in in three different
experimental models of lung cancer, including of mutant KRAS–
driven lung tumors and human NSCLC cell line- and PDX tumors.
The in vivo antitumor activities of SH-1242 were comparable with
those of 17-AAG and deguelin; (iii) SH-1242 exhibited considerably lower cytotoxicity than deguelin in viability of several
normal cells originated from various organs; (iv) SH-1242 was
well tolerated in mice without any detectable inﬂammation and
injury in major organs, including lung, liver, kidney, spleen,
stomach, and ovary, after several weeks of treatment at therapeutic
doses; and (v) compared with deguelin, SH-1242 exhibited
markedly reduced effects on tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in rat brains. These collective ﬁndings indicated that SH1242 could be an effective cancer therapeutic agent through its
orchestrated inhibitory actions on tumor growth and angiogenesis with minimal histologic toxicities and neuropathologic
disorders.
We investigated the mechanism of SH-1242–mediated antitumor activities. We ﬁrst conﬁrmed decreased interaction
between Hsp90 and its client proteins and reduced expression
of various Hsp90 client proteins in NSCLC cancer cells after
treatment with SH-1242. We then identiﬁed the following
features of SH-1242 as a novel C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitor:
(i) direct binding of SH-1242 to the potential C-terminal
nucleotide-binding region of Hsp90; (ii) the disruption of the
interaction between Hsp90 and a C-terminal speciﬁc co-chaperone Hop by SH-1242 treatment; (iii) lack of the cytoprotective Hsp70 induction by SH-1242, which is the known feature
of C-terminal Hsp90 inhibitors (13); and (iv) lower Kd value
toward Hsp90 C-terminal domain compared with N-terminal
domain. Our computational modeling using structure–function analysis further supports the mechanistic insights. Our
docking model suggests that SH-1242 competes with ATP for a
C-terminal ATP-binding site. In addition, SH-1242 forms
hydrogen bonds with the residues both in chain A and chain
B, which may stabilize the open state of the Hsp90 homodimer.
We also compared the Surﬂex-Dock docking scores of known
Hsp90 C- or N-terminal inhibitors, including SH-1242, after
docking into the C-terminal region. As shown in Supplementary Table S2, most of the known Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors
were high-ranked, except the N-terminal inhibitor ganetespib.

www.aacrjournals.org

SH-1242 also ranked higher than the well-deﬁned C-terminal
inhibitor novobiocin. In addition, the calculated molecular
volume of SH-1242 is approximately 70% of that of cisplatin.
Cisplatin binding to Hsp90 requires a large conformational
change that carries a high entropic penalty. The molecular size
and structural rigidity of SH-1242 could be more entropically
favorable when binding to the Hsp90 C-terminal compared
with those of cisplatin. Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest that
SH-1242 is a potential lead candidate for the development of
Hsp90 C-terminal inhibitors.
Taken together, our ﬁndings provide evidence that SH1242 effectively disrupts Hsp90 function by directly binding
to the C-terminal ATP-binding site of Hsp90 and inhibiting
its chaperone activity. A concomitant degradation of several
Hsp90 client proteins induced by SH-1242 could have
resulted in the potent antitumor activities of the drug against
various NSCLC cell lines in vitro and the growth of KRAS–
driven spontaneous lung tumor and human NSCLC cell lineand PDX tumors in mice. Moreover, when tested in vitro in
various normal cells and in vivo in mice and rats, SH-1242
revealed an excellent toxicity proﬁles. These ﬁndings suggest
the potential of SH-1242 as an effective anticancer agent
targeting the C-terminal domain of Hsp90. The antitumor
activities of SH-1242 in na€ve and drug-resistant NSCLC cells
also suggest a broad application of the drug in the ﬁrst- and
second-line treatment. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the efﬁcacy of SH-1242 in additional preclinical and
clinical settings.
