ABSTRACT
The response of BRAF-mutant melanoma patients to BRAF inhibitors is
dramatically impaired by secondary resistances and rapid relapse. So far, the
molecular mechanisms driving these resistances are not completely understood.
Here, we show that, in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells, inhibition of BRAF or its target
MEK induces RHOB expression by a mechanism that depends on the transcription
factor c-Jun. In those cells, RHOB deficiency causes hypersensitivity to BRAF and MEK
inhibitors-induced apoptosis. Supporting these results, loss of RHOB expression in
metastatic melanoma tissues is associated with an increased progression-free survival
of BRAF-mutant patients treated with vemurafenib. Following BRAF inhibition, RHOB
activates AKT whose inhibition causes hypersensitivity of BRAF-mutant melanoma
cells to BRAF inhibitors. In mice, AKT inhibition synergizes with vemurafenib to block
tumor growth of BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma. Our findings reveal that BRAF
inhibition activates a c-Jun/RHOB/AKT pathway that promotes tumor cell survival and
further support a role of this pathway in the resistance of melanoma to vemurafenib.
Our data also highlight the importance of using RHOB tumor levels as a biomarker to
predict vemurafenib patient’s response and to select those that would benefit of the
combination with AKT inhibitors.

respectively) emerged as a therapeutic strategy [2]. The
first-in-class specific BRAFi, vemurafenib (PLX4032), led
to an unprecedented response for 80% patients in phase III
clinical trials [3, 4]. However, the improvement of diseasefree survival and global survival was disappointingly
weak, due to the rapid acquisition of resistance, opening
the way to the discovery of new classes of MAPK
inhibitors [5] or to BRAFi combinations with cytotoxic
drugs [6].

INTRODUCTION
The hypothesis of melanoma addiction to the RAF/
MEK/ERK pathway, namely the MAPK pathway, emerged
with the discovery of a high frequency of the BRAFV600Eactivating mutation in melanoma cell lines and primary
tumors [1]. Since then, evidence of melanoma dependency
on MAPK pathway accumulated and its inhibition by
either BRAF or MEK inhibitors (BRAFi and MEKi,

than BRAFi alone on BRAF-mutant cells. Finally, we
demonstrate that the expression of RHOB in melanoma
tissues determines a poor clinical response to PLX4032.
Altogether, these findings support a potential role for
RHOB as a predictive biomarker to PLX4032 therapy
and the c-Jun/RHOB/AKT signaling axis as a new
target to prevent resistance to BRAFi of BRAF-mutant
melanoma tumors.

Intensive investigations led to identify several
resistance mechanisms on the basis of in vitro resistant
cell lines and clinical studies. Most of them reactivate
the MAPK and/or PI3K/AKT pathways by acquisition
of RAS and MEK mutations [7, 8], or over-expression of
COT [9], CRAF or growth factor receptor such as FGFR3,
EGFR, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ [7, 10–13]. Moreover, MAPK
inhibition modulates transcription factors expression that
could regulate adaptive responses [14]. Although their
roles are not clearly defined, the genes whose expression
is modulated could impact on the sensitivity of melanoma
cells to BRAFi and therefore could be of clinical
relevance. In line with this hypothesis, the transcription
factor FOXD3 and the pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein
NOXA, are induced and down-regulated, respectively
following PLX4032 treatment thus promoting resistance to
cell death [15, 16]. Hence, MAPK inhibition can regulate
per se the expression of resistance factors.
RHOGTPases are regulated by many signaling
pathways, such as the MAPK pathway, and control
numerous cellular functions including the balance between
survival and apoptosis [17]. In that way, they may impact
on the cellular response to MAPK inhibitors. Crossregulations between RHOGTPases and MAPK pathways
have been reported [18, 19] and several members of the
RHOGTPase family have been involved in apoptosis
inhibition to both chemotherapies and targeted therapies.
For instance, RHOJ mediates melanoma cell resistance
to dacarbazine [20], RAC1 is involved in breast cancer
cell response to trastuzumab [21] and RHOE/RND3
enhances multidrug resistance in gastric cancer cells [22].
In addition, inhibition of MAPK pathway has an impact
on the regulation of the expression of RHOGTPase
genes. This may result in a modulation of the tumor
cell sensitivity to MAPK inhibitors, as demonstrated for
RHOE/RND3, which impedes melanoma cell invasion in
response to PLX4032 [23].
We therefore investigated the role of RHOGTPases
in melanoma cell response to PLX4032 and others
inhibitors of the MAPK pathway. Using RT-qPCR
screening, we detected a significant induction of RHOB
expression upon PLX4032 treatment in BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells. RHOB is well known to be modulated
in response to anticancer therapies and to control tumor
cell response to ionizing radiation and cytotoxic drugs
[24–26]. Moreover, RHOB has also been involved
in the response to targeted therapy as described by
Vishnu and colleagues in ovarian cells [27]. Here, we
show that in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells, PLX4032
induces c-Jun activation resulting in RHOB expression
and subsequent AKT activation. We demonstrate that
pharmacological association of BRAFi with AKT
inhibitors (AKTi) displays a higher antitumor activity

RESULTS
RHOB expression is induced by the BRAFi
PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells
We first analyzed RHOGTPase transcripts in
the metastatic BRAFV600X-mutant melanoma cell lines
WM266-4 and A375 following a 48 h treatment
with PLX4032. In both cell lines, RAC1b mRNA
levels decreased while those of RHOB, RHOJ and
RHOQ increased (Figure 1A and 1B). RHOB was
the most induced gene with a factor of 5.7 ± 1.2 in
WM266-4 cells (Figure 1A) and of 2.0 ± 0.3 in A375
cells (Figure 1B). In those two cell lines, the increase
in the RHOB mRNA level was associated with an
increase in the RHOB protein level (Figure 1C).
PLX4032 treatment also increased RHOB protein level
in six other BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, which are
representative of melanoma progression (RGP-VGP to
metastatic) (Figure 1D).
The increase in RHOB expression in WM266-4
cells treated with PLX4032 for 48 h was dose-dependent,
reaching a maximum at 1 μM, and was coincident with
the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation (Figure 1E
and  1F). At this PLX4032 concentration, RHOB
induction was clearly detected after 24 h and increased
over time (Figures 1F and S1). In contrast, the two
RHOB homologs RHOA and RHOC were not induced
(Figures 1F and S1). To determine whether continuous
exposure to PLX4032 was necessary to maintain the
observed elevated expression of RHOB, we examined
RHOB expression following PLX4032 removal. We
found that RHOB expression was maintained and
did not return to its baseline levels even 96 h after
termination of the PLX4032 treatment (Figure 1G). As a
control, ERK phosphorylation was recovered after 24 h
indicating that BRAF inhibition was indeed obliterated
(Figure 1G). These results suggest that although BRAF
inhibition is required to prime RHOB induction, an
adaptive mechanism of melanoma cells may occur
following PLX4032 treatment to maintain high levels of
RHOB. We conclude that PLX4032 triggers a sustained
induction of RHOB expression in BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells.

MAPK inhibition triggers RHOB induction in
BRAF-mutant melanoma cells

KRAS (WM1791C cells). Consistent with the selectivity of
PLX4032 for BRAF-mutant cells, it failed to inhibit MAPK
signaling in these four cell lines, as shown by the lack of
decrease in ERK phosphorylation, and the lack of RHOB
induction (Figure  2C). In contrast, the MEKi AZD6244
inhibited ERK phosphorylation and induced RHOB
expression (Figure 2C). Taken together, these results indicate
that the BRAF/MEK pathway regulates RHOB expression.
The induction of RHOB after MAPK pathway
inhibition suggests that this phenomenon could be a
common feature for BRAF-mutant tumor cells. We
therefore tested the effect of PLX4032 and AZD6244
treatment on BRAFV600E-mutant colon cancer cells.
As shown in Figure 2D, efficient inhibition of MAPK
signaling with PLX4032 or AZD6244, demonstrated by
inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, did not significantly
affect RHOB expression even with a higher dose (5 μM)
than that used in melanoma cells (1 μM). These results
suggest that RHOB modulation by MAPK signaling is not
a common mechanism in BRAF-mutant cells but a feature
of specific tumors such as melanoma.

Next we addressed whether RHOB induction by
PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells was related
to BRAF inactivation. We found that BRAF inhibition
with siRNA or with the PLX4032-unrelated BRAFV600E
inhibitor SB590885 increased RHOB protein levels in
WM266-4 cells (Figure 2A, 2B). Inhibition of the BRAF
substrate MEK with AZD6244 or AS703026 also resulted
in an increased RHOB expression in those cells (Figure 2B).
These results indicate that BRAF inactivation causes RHOB
overexpression in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells.
In melanomas, the MAPK pathway is frequently
hyperactivated by mutations in the BRAF gene
(approximately 50% of melanomas) but also in NRAS
(18%), KIT (9%), HRAS (2%) or KRAS (2%) genes
(COSMIC database). We therefore examined the impact
of PLX4032 and MEKi on RHOB expression in wild
type BRAF melanoma cells harboring mutations in NRAS
(WM1346 and SK-MEL2 cells), KIT (WM3211 cells) or

c-Jun is involved in PLX4032-induced RHOB
expression

These results indicate that this promoter region is required
for RHOB induction by PLX4032.
The iCCAAT region has been reported to control
RHOB expression in cell stress response in a c-Jundependent manner [31–33]. Hence, we examined c-Jun
activation after PLX4032 treatment by analyzing both total
and phosphorylated (S63) c-Jun. Figure 3E shows that
both c-Jun and p-c-Jun (S63) were induced in response to
PLX4032. As for RHOB, total and phosphorylated c-Jun
were maintained over at least 96 h after PLX4032 removal
(Figure S2A). To assess more directly the role of c-Jun in
RHOB upregulation, we inhibited its expression. We found
that siRNA-mediated depletion of c-Jun prevented the
induction of RHOB in response to PLX4032 (Figure 3F).
Previous work show that JNK and p38 are
implicated in the activation of the c-Jun/RHOB axis in
response to UV and γ-radiation [32, 34]. However, we
found that phosphorylated p38 and JNK rather decreased
following PLX4032 treatment (Figure S2B). In addition,
the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, as well as the p38 inhibitors,
SB203580 and BIRB796, did not prevent PLX4032induced c-Jun and RHOB expression (Figure S2C and
S2D). Together, these data indicate that PLX4032 induces

We next investigated the mechanism underlying
RHOB induction by PLX4032. Increase of RHOB
transcript stability has been reported in response to
UV  [28, 29] and camptothecin [30]. Experiments
performed in the presence of the transcription inhibitor
actinomycin D showed that the half-life of RHOB mRNA
was not significantly prolonged in PLX4032-treated cells
(Figure 3A). We then analyzed RHOB promoter activity
using a luciferase reporter gene assay system. We found
a 2 to 3-fold increase of RHOB promoter activity after a
24 h PLX4032 treatment (Figure 3B).
To identify the promoter region involved in the
transcriptional activation of RHOB in response to
PLX4032, we performed luciferase assays with plasmids
containing different RHOB promoter lengths. We found
that all constructs increased luciferase activity following
PLX4032 treatment, including the -45 shorter one, which
contains only the TATA boxes and an inverted CCAAT box
(iCCAAT) (Figure 3C). Mutations of iCCAAT strongly
reduced promoter response to PLX4032 (Figure  3D).

c-Jun expression and phosphorylation by a JNK- and
p38- independent mechanism.

RHOB expression levels were subsequently
analyzed by immunostaining in a retrospective series
of 32 biopsies from patients with metastatic melanoma
harboring BRAFV600X mutations, receiving PLX4032
as a front-line therapy (Figure 6C). We observed a
significant expression of RHOB in 8 out of the 32 samples
(Table S5). Interestingly, we found that the Progression
Free Survival (PFS) was significantly shorter in patients
whose tumor samples displayed a positive RHOB
staining before treatment compared to those with negative
RHOB staining (median PFS: 135 days [Interquartile
range – IQR: 107; 141] versus 235 days [IQR: 214; 314]
respectively; p < 10-3) (Figure 6D and Table S5), with a
hazard ratio of short-duration therapeutic response of 10−3
(95% confidence interval – 95% CI: 2 × 10−4; 9 × 10−3). We
conclude that the basal expression of RHOB in tumor cells
may represent a predictive value of PLX4032 response to
treatment in BRAFV600X metastatic melanoma.

Inhibition of RHOB sensitizes melanoma cells to
MAPK inhibitors-induced apoptosis
To determine the role of RHOB in the cellular
response to MAPK inhibitors, RHOB expression was
prevented by RNA interference (Figure S3A). Following
RHOB depletion, the IC50 of PLX4032 was significantly
reduced in the BRAF-mutant A375 and WM266-4 cells
but not in the wild-type BRAF SK-MEL2 cells which
are insensitive to PLX4032 (Figure 4A, 4B and 4C and
Table S1). In contrast, RHOB depletion sensitized both
mutant and wild-type BRAF cells to the MEKi AZD6244
(Figure 4D, 4E and 4F and Table S1). Likewise, RHOB
downregulation also sensitized WM266-4 cells to the
combination of BRAFi with MEKi (Figure 4G). Because
we found that c-Jun induces RHOB (Figure 3), we
examined whether c-Jun inhibition would also sensitize
cells to PLX4032. We found that depletion of c-Jun
with siRNA sensitized WM266-4 cells to PLX4032
(Figure 4H and Table S2) and that this effect was in part
reversed by adenovirus-mediated RHOB overexpression
(Figures 4I and S3B and Table S3).
To study the mechanisms underlying RHOBdependent cell sensitivity to PLX4032, we assayed
apoptotic markers after RHOB depletion. We found that
RHOB siRNA increased apoptosis of WM266-4 cells in
response to PLX4032 as demonstrated by an increase in
the number of nuclei with subG1 DNA content, in apoptotic
DNA fragmentation and in PARP and caspase-3 cleavage
(Figure 5A-5C). Similar results were obtained in A375 cells
(Figure S4). In addition, the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VADFMK prevented PLX4032-induced PARP and caspase-3
cleavage (Figure 5D) and the accumulation of subG1 cells
(Figure 5E). Overall these data show that RHOB depletion
triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis of BRAF-mutant
melanoma cells exposed to MAPK inhibitors.

RHOB modulates response to PLX4032 through
AKT pathway
Lastly, we investigated the molecular mechanisms
by which RHOB impairs an efficient response to
PLX4032. It has been previously reported that RHOB
activates the AKT pathway [28, 35–37] and that AKT
is activated following PLX4032 treatment [38]. We
demonstrate that phosphorylated AKT is markedly
reduced in response to simultaneous RHOB depletion
and PLX4032 treatment in BRAF-mutant cells WM266-4
(Figure 7A), Lu1205, WM239A, RPMI-7951 (Figure S5).
Same findings were observed in NRAS-mutant cells
WM1346 treated with the MEKi AZD6244 (Figure S5).
These data suggest that RHOB inhibition impedes AKT
signaling. Therefore the resistance to PLX4032 should
be recovered in RHOB knockdown cells when AKT
phosphorylation is rescued by expressing a constitutively
active AKT-myr protein. Consistent with this hypothesis,
overexpression of AKT-myr in RHOB depleted cells
completely abolished sensitization to PLX4032
(Figures 7B and S6 and Table S4).
These findings highlight that AKT inhibition would
reverse RHOB-mediated PLX4032 resistance. In order
to confirm this assumption, we analyzed the combination
of PLX4032 with AKT inhibitors, either G594 (an ATP
competitive inhibitor of AKT provided by Genentech) or
MK2206. AKT inhibition enhanced PLX4032 cytotoxic
effect as shown by an increased PARP and caspase-3
cleavage (Figures 7C and S7). To determine whether
combination of PI3K/AKTi and BRAFi displays additive
or synergistic effect, co-treatments were performed in vitro
and combination indexes were calculated. All three PI3K/
AKT pathway inhibitors (LY294002, MK2206 and
G594) demonstrated a substantial synergistic effect when
combined with PLX4032 in WM266-4 cells (Figure 7D).
 

High basal RHOB expression in melanoma cell
lines and patients biopsies is associated with a
poor response to PLX4032
Given that RHOB depletion determines the cellular
response to PLX4032 in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells,
we hypothesized that the basal expression of RHOB may
predict the response to BRAFi. Therefore, we compared
RHOB mRNA levels (Figure 6A) with the IC50 of
PLX4032 (Figure 6B) in 8 different cell lines. A strong
correlation was observed between RHOB basal expression
and PLX4032 IC50. Cell lines with low RHOB expression
were more sensitive to PLX4032, suggesting that, in
melanoma cells, high RHOB expression may predict a
poor response of BRAF-mutant patients to PLX4032.

targeting c-Jun (si-c-Jun), then transduced with adenovirus control (Ad-Ctl) or expressing RHOB (Ad-RHOB) and treated for 72 h with
PLX4032. In each condition, cell viability was measured by MTS and the dose-response was analyzed (except in G).

In a same manner, a synergistic effect was found between
the AKTi, G594 and PLX4032 in the 7 other BRAF-mutant
cell lines and between G594 and AZD6244 in 2 NRASmutant cell lines (Table S6).
We next evaluated this combination effect in
the WM266-4 xenografted mouse model. After tumor
appearance, mice were treated with control vehicle, G594
and/or PLX4032 and the tumor growth was monitored.
As shown in Figures 7E and S8, both tumor growth and

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

tumor weight were significantly reduced in mice receiving
BRAFi/AKTi combination compared to the monotherapies
(Figures 7E and S8), confirming that AKT signaling
pathway plays a role in the in vivo responses of BRAFmutant tumors to PLX4032.
We conclude that PLX4032-induced RHOB
expression drives AKT-dependent cell survival and that
BRAFi/AKTi combination should improve therapeutic
response of RHOB positive tumors.

DISCUSSION

Importantly, we found that the expression of 6 members
of the RHOGTPase family was significantly modified
in response to PLX4032 in melanoma cells. RND3 is
downregulated as previously described [23] whereas
RHOB, RHOJ, RHOQ and RHOU are induced. While
nothing is known about the role of RHOQ and RHOU in
melanomagenesis, RHOJ participates to chemoresistance
through DNA repair control [20] and modulates metastasis
potential in melanoma [39]. Of interest is the PLX4032induced RAC1b downregulation, suggesting that RAC1b
and BRAF cooperate in melanomagenesis as previously
described in colorectal cancer [40].

In this study we demonstrate that inhibition of mutant
BRAF in melanoma cells with pharmacological inhibitors
or siRNA knockdown results in the activation of the c-Jun/
RHOB/AKT signaling axis, which leads to cell survival.
Interestingly, a concomitant consequence of c-Jun/RHOB/
AKT activation is a decrease of PLX4032 cellular responses,
entailing acquired resistance.
RHO proteins have been shown to play a role in
modulating cell survival and some of them have been
described to be regulated by the MAPK pathway [17].

We focused our attention on the stress-inducible
RHOB gene [28, 30, 33, 41, 42] that plays a negative
role on tumor progression. Moreover, RHOB functions
are mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors and their
downstream effectors [25, 26, 43]. We have demonstrated
previously that RHOB is downregulated by KRASV12
in lung cancer cell lines increasing invasiveness via
AKT1 [44]. More recently, we have revealed that RHOB
knock-out is critical to determine tumor aggressiveness in
a murine EGFRL858R-induced lung adenocarcinoma [45].
Herein, we show that BRAFV600 mutant causes a MAPKdependent decrease of RHOB expression in melanoma
cell lines. It is likely that the mechanism of RHOB
downregulation is related to cell type and/or cell context.
Indeed, Jiang et al. [46] found that AKT induced RHOB
downregulation in non-melanoma cell lines. According to
our cellular data, the patient’s samples revealed an absence
of RHOB expression in more than 70% of melanoma
tissues bearing BRAFV600E mutants. This suggests that
reduced RHOB levels represent a critical event during
melanomagenesis.
The observation of a persistent RHOB expression
after PLX4032 removal, despite ERK re-phosphorylation
(Figure 1G), suggests that RHOB participates to
an original long lasting adaptive cellular program
in  melanoma cells. We show that RHOB expression
after PLX4032 treatment depends on the transcription
factor c-Jun. It has been demonstrated that iCCAAT is
critical for UVB-induced RHOB expression [32, 47]. In
that model, phosphorylated c-Jun is associated to ATF2
and NF-Y inducing HDAC1 release then allowing p300
binding to iCCAAT triggering RHOB expression. In stress
conditions, c-Jun was described to be phosphorylated
following JNK and p38 activation [32, 34] while in our
model JNK and p38 were not involved in PLX4032induced c-Jun phosphorylation and expression. We
evidence here a key role of c-Jun in the long lasting
regulation of RHOB expression by PLX4032 and the
significance of this pathway in cell survival following
cellular treatment.
RHOB has been demonstrated to control AKT
phosphorylation to exert its cellular functions in many cell
types. Here, we demonstrated that, by contrast to lung [44]
and breast cancer [36] cells, RHOB downregulation
decreases AKT phosphorylation in melanoma, similarly
to endothelial cells [36, 48] (Figures 7A and S5). These
data reinforce the notion that the modulation of AKT
phosphorylation by RHOB depends on the cellular
phenotype. We show here that RHOB/AKT signaling
inhibition is critical for PLX4032-induced caspasedependent apoptosis. In the same way, genotoxic stressinduced RHOB expression favors cell survival through
AKT pathway [28, 30, 35, 41, 49]. We provide new
evidence that the RHOB/AKT axis is a common adaptive
mechanism to cell injury.

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

It has been previously reported that AKT is activated
in PLX4032-treated PTEN negative melanoma and is
involved in melanoma resistance [50]. However, the role
of the c-Jun/RHOB/AKT axis in the cellular sensitivity to
MAPK inhibitors appeared to be independent on PTEN
status. Indeed, whereas WM266-4 cells lack PTEN
expression, A375 cells are wild-type for PTEN and are
also sensitized to MAPK inhibitors by RHOB siRNA
(Figures 4, 5 and S4) or AKTi (Figure 7, Table S6).
The combination of PI3K/AKT inhibitors with
PLX4032 to improve melanoma treatment has been
recently proposed although the mechanism was not
clearly established. We demonstrate that PLX4032
induces a cell adaptive response including a long lasting
expression of c-Jun and RHOB leading to the activation
of AKT signaling axis which may trigger cell resistance
by inhibiting apoptosis. While AKTi are not able to
induce cell death by themselves they lead to a synergistic
synthetic lethal interaction with BRAFi. Our observations
further support the rational to treat patients with a
combination of BRAF and AKT inhibitors.
Finally, our results on metastatic melanoma biopsies
highlight a pivotal role for RHOB in the therapeutic
management of this disease. Interestingly, the analysis of
RHOB expression in these samples revealed that patients
with RHOB positive biopsies displayed a poor response
to PLX4032. We therefore hypothesize that patients
with a high RHOB expression would display a high
AKT pathway activity and benefit from BRAF and AKT
inhibitors combination rather than BRAFi monotherapy.
However, it could not be excluded that RHOB negative
patients’ survival would also be improved by such a
therapeutic combination by preventing potential late
resistance appearance. Analyzing future combinational
clinical trial regarding RHOB status will bring answers to
these remaining questions.
Taken together, our findings tempt us to conclude
that the c-Jun/RHOB/AKT signaling axis is a synthetic
lethal partner of BRAF-mutant, and potentially of NRASmutant, melanomas and to propose RHOB as a critical
biomarker to predict patient’s response to PLX4032 and
to select those that would benefit of the combination with
AKT inhibitors.

Quantitative real-time reverse
transcription–PCR
Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy® kit (Qiagen)
and reverse-transcripted using iScriptTM cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative PCR was performed with a
CFX96TM detection system (Bio-Rad) using iQTM SYBR®
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and normalized to actin or
28S. Primers sequences are detailed in Table S8.

Transfection

Study of RHOB promoter activity

RNA interference was achieved by transfecting
siRNA with OligofectamineTM in OptiMEMTM (Invitrogen)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After
6 h, transfection medium was replaced and inhibitors
were added. siRNA sequences are reported in Table S7.
pCMV6-AKT-myr plasmid, gifted by Pr. Franke
(Columbia University) and pCMV6-CTRL were cotransfected with siRNA using Lipofectamine® 2000 in
OptiMEMTM.

The previously described pGL3-RHOB plasmids
containing different lengths of RHOB promoter sequence
upstream of the firefly luciferase gene into pGL3
luciferase reporter vector [52] were co-transfected with
pRL-CMV vector (Promega) as an internal control with
LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). The iCCAAT of the
shorter construct (-45) was mutated using QuickChange®
Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene). The
obtained constructs were sequenced to ensure successful
mutagenesis. Firefly and renilla luciferase activities
were measured with Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay
(Promega).

 

Adenovirus transduction
Cells were first transfected with siRNA and then
transduced overnight at M.O.I 25 with replicationdefective (∆E1, E3) adenoviral vectors expressing RHOB
(Ad-RHOB) or control under the transcriptional control of
the CMV promoter as previously described [51].

Apoptosis analysis
DNA fragmentation was detected by a modified
TUNEL procedure using the ApopTag® Fluorescein In Situ
Apoptosis Detection Kit (Millipore). Positive cells were
counted by fluorescence microscopy. For subG1 analysis,
DNA content was assessed by staining ethanol-fixed cells
with propidium iodide and monitoring by FACSCaliburTM
(BD Biosciences). The number of cells with subG1 DNA
content was determined with the ModFit software.

Cell proliferation assay
After transfection or transduction, cells were
treated with inhibitors. 72 h later, the relative number
of viable cells was measured by incubating cells with
MTS reagent (CellTiter 96® AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay from Promega) as recommended by
the manufacturer. Relative cell survival in the presence
of inhibitors was normalized to the untreated cells after
background corrections.

Animal studies
1.2 × 106 WM266-4 cells were subcutaneously
injected into the flank of 6 weeks female athymic mice
(NMRI-NU, Janvier) and allowed to grow 10  days.
Subsequently, animals received by oral gavage
50 mg/  kg/  bid of PLX4032 and/or 20 mg/kg/day
G594 or vehicle. PLX4032, formulated as MBP, and G594
were provided by Genentech and prepared according to
their advices. Tumor sizes were evaluated every 3 days
by caliper measurement of two perpendicular diameters
(l < L) and the tumor volumes were calculated with the
following equation tumor volume = l × l × L/2. Animals
were euthanized after 21 days of treatment, tumor were
harvested and weighted. All animal procedures were
performed in accordance with the animal care guidelines
