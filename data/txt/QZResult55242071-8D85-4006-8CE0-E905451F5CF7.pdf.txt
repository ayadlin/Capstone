BACKGROUND: The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is dysregulated in
patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Buparlisib is a pan-PI3K inhibitor with activity in advanced solid tumors. The
primary objective of the current study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose-limiting toxicities of buparlisib
and bevacizumab in patients with mRCC. Secondary objectives included efficacy, biomarker discovery, and additional toxicity. METHODS: This was a standard 3 1 3 dose escalation study of buparlisib (at a dose of 60-100 mg/day) and bevacizumab (at a dose of 10
mg/kg every 2 weeks). After the MTD was defined, 15 patients were accrued to the expansion cohort. RESULTS: Thirty-two patients
were accrued (3 were treated at 60 mg/day, 21 were treated at 80 mg/day, 6 were treated at 100 mg/day, and 2 patients never
received therapy). The majority of patients had clear cell histology (87%) and 50% had received 2 prior lines of therapy. The MTD of
buparlisib was 80 mg/day and that of bevacizumab was 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. A total of 28 patients discontinued therapy: 17
because of disease progression, 7 because of toxicity, and 4 for other reasons. Dose-limiting toxicities included rash/pruritis, elevated
lipase/amylase, anorexia, and psychiatric disorders (suicidal ideation, depression, and cognitive disturbances). Of the 30 patients who
received at least 1 dose, 13% achieved a partial response (95% confidence interval, 4%-31%). Two patients harboring activating PI3KA
mutations achieved 42% and 16% maximal tumor shrinkage, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Buparlisib at a dose of 80 mg/day with
bevacizumab was found to be a tolerable regimen with preliminary activity in vascular endothelial growth factor-refractory mRCC.
The benefit of this combination may be of interest for future mRCC trials, possibly in a selected patient population. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Angiogenesis is an essential driver of tumorigenesis and disease progression in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(mRCC).1 Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors are critical in the process of angiogenesis, and
numerous studies have demonstrated that the VEGF signaling pathway drives RCC pathogenesis.2,3 The importance of
the VEGF signaling pathway in RCC is made evident by the success of VEGF-targeting agents (ie, axitinib, bevacizumab,
pazopanib, sorafeninb, and sunitinib), which have improved the overall survival (OS) of patients with this disease.4-8
However, mRCC remains, for the most part, an incurable disease, and the majority of patients develop resistance to
VEGF-targeted therapy.9
In addition to the commonly altered Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)/hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway, which
activates its downstream target VEGF, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway is recurrently altered in both
clear cell and non-clear cell RCC and is thought to play a central role in cancer progression.10,11 Although to our knowledge the exact mechanism of HIF pathway activation is not well characterized, it is postulated that PI3K activation results
in an increase in HIF-1a gene expression, leading to resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy.12 Thus, the PI3K pathway

represents a potential therapeutic target in patients with
RCC, supporting the rationale for combinatorial PI3K
and VEGF inhibition.10
Buparlisib (BKM-120) is an orally bioavailable paninhibitor of PI3K. Buparlisib specifically inhibits class I
PI3K in an ATP-competitive manner, reducing the production of the secondary messenger phosphatidylinositol3,4,5-trisphosphate. Buparlisib reduces the phosphorylation of direct downstream effector AKT (protein kinase
B).13 In addition to inhibiting all isoforms of wild-type
PI3K, this compound has been demonstrated to inhibit
PI3K-a-harboring somatic mutations. To the best of our
knowledge, few data are available regarding its ability to
inhibit the other mutated isoforms.14 In a first-in-human
phase 1 clinical trial, buparlisib demonstrated a tolerable
safety profile and antitumor activity in several solid
tumors independent of PI3K and phosphatase and tensin
homolog (PTEN) mutational status and demonstrated a
high correlation between buparlisib exposure and inhibition of PI3K signaling.15
Bevacizumab, a monoclonal VEGF-binding antibody, has already been approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration for use in 7 different tumor types,
including RCC.16 Given the potential to overcome intrinsic and acquired resistance to VEGF-targeted therapy,
combination strategies of targeted therapies are being
explored to improve long-term outcomes among patients
with metastatic disease.17 To our knowledge to date, these
combinations have demonstrated modest clinical benefits,
and the majority of studies have shown significant toxicity.18 As a monoclonal antibody, bevacizumab’s side effect
profile differs from that of the kinase inhibitors. Given
fewer expected overlapping toxicities, bevacizumab has
been tested in combination with several compounds such
as temsirolimus or erlortinib with demonstrated feasibility
and tolerability.18-20
Herein, we report the results of an open-label phase
1 clinical study assessing the safety, tolerability, and antitumor activity of buparlisib given concurrently with bevacizumab in a cohort of previously treated patients with
mRCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Population

Patients with mRCC with a clear cell component or papillary or chromophobe histologies were eligible. Participants must have received at least 1 prior anti-VEGF
systemic therapy for mRCC (excluding bevacizumab and
a PI3K inhibitor). Prior treatment with everolimus or
2390

temsirolimus was allowed. Other eligibility criteria
included age 18 years; an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2; absolute neutrophil
count 1.5 3 109/L; platelet count 100 3 109/L;
hemoglobin 9 g/dL; serum creatinine 1.5 the upper
limit of normal (ULN); fasting glucose 120 mg/dL or
hemoglobin A1c 6.7%; a urine protein/creatinine ratio
<1.5 or 11 protein on urinalysis; and amylase, lipase,
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (or 3 times the ULN
if liver metastases were present), alanine aminotransferase
(ALT) (or 3 times the ULN if liver metastases were present), bilirubin (or 1.5 times the ULN if liver metastases
were present), calcium (corrected for serum albumin), potassium, and magnesium within the institutional normal
range. Patients with untreated brain metastases, active
liver disease, active pancreatic disease including poorly
controlled diabetes, cardiac disease, and poorly controlled
hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pressure
>140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90 mmHg)
were excluded. Patients with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0) anxiety or active psychiatric illness were excluded unless disease was stable
without modifications to medical therapy within 6 weeks
of therapy initiation.
Study Design and Treatment

The current study was a multicenter, open-label, investigator-sponsored, single-arm, phase 1 study with a standard 313 dose escalation design followed by dose
expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
buparlisib and bevacizumab (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT01283048) (Fig. 1). The study was conducted at 3
institutions in the United States: Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute (Boston, Mass), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical
Center (Boston, Mass), and Karmanos Cancer Institute
(Detroit, Mich). Patients received oral buparlisib once
daily in a continuous schedule of 28-day cycles. Bevacizumab was administered intravenously every 2 weeks.
Buparlisib was administered at escalating doses (60 mg,
80 mg, and 100 mg once daily). Bevacizumab was administered at a fixed dose of 10 mg/kg. Once the MTD was
achieved, an expansion cohort including 15 patients was
conducted at the MTD for additional safety and efficacy
evaluations.
Routine clinical and laboratory assessments were
conducted at baseline and weekly for the first cycle and
then on days 1 and 15 of each subsequent cycle. Patients
were evaluated for adverse events (AEs) on the basis of
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.0). Radiologic assessments were performed every

8 weeks. Hematologic dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
included persistent grade 3 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia, any febrile neutropenia, and grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Nonhematologic DLTs included grade 1
neurocognitive disorder, persistent grade 2 or any grade
3 mood alteration, persistent grade 2 phototoxicity or
skin toxicity, persistent elevations in creatinine or grade
>3 creatinine elevations, persistent elevations in bilirubin
or any grade >3 bilirubin elevations, persistent grade 3 or
any grade 4 AST or ALT elevations, persistent grade 2 or
any grade 3 hyperglycemia, and grade 2 pancreatitis
or persistent grade 3 or any grade 4 amylase and/or lipase
elevations. Any other grade 3 toxicity also was considered to be a DLT, with the following exceptions: anemia,
lymphopenia, and elevations in alkaline phosphatase.
Patients who experienced grades 3 to 4 AEs had dose
adjustments as specified in the clinical study. Dose reductions for bevacizumab or buparlisib below the starting
dose of 60 mg were not allowed. Patients remained on
study until intolerable toxicity, disease progression, or
withdrawal occurred.
Primary Endpoints

The primary objective of the current study was to determine the MTD and DLTs of the combination of buparlisib and bevacizumab in patients with mRCC. The MTD
was defined as the highest dose at which 1 of 6 new participants in a dosing cohort experienced a DLT possibly
related to the study drug during the first cycle of treatment. Secondary objectives included safety and tolerability, objective response rate (ORR), time to treatment

failure (TTF), and OS. All participants who received at
least 1 dose of the study treatment were evaluable for toxicity. Disease response was defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) (version 1.1).21
TTF was defined as the time from study enrollment to
treatment discontinuation for any reason. OS was defined
as the time from study enrollment to death from any
cause.
Mental Safety Assessment

Due to the central nervous system penetration of the drug
and the incidence of mood disorders, 2 different evaluation tests were performed to analyze the effects of buparlisib on depression and anxiety; the Patient Health
Questionnaire (PHQ-9), a diagnostic tool with which to
assess mental health disorders, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7), a scale for anxiety, were
performed at baseline, cycle 1, and cycle 2 to assess mental
health during the study period. PHQ-9 scores from 0 to
27 and the cutoff values of 5, 10, 15, and 20 represent the
thresholds toward severe depression, with higher scores
representing worse symptoms.22 GAD-7 scores from 0 to
21 and the cutoff values of 5, 10, and 15 represent the
thresholds toward severe anxiety, with higher scores representing worse symptoms.23
Biomarker Assessments

To examine the effects of buparlisib on metabolism, fasting serum lipids and fasting glucose levels were measured
on days 1 and 15 of every cycle until therapy discontinuation. To identify genetic mechanisms of sensitivity to

the buparlisib-based combination, 9 patients treated at
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute underwent genomic profiling of tumor tissue as part of a separate local Institutional
Review Board-approved protocol. Mutation profiling was
performed using massively parallel sequencing technology
(OncoPanel, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA)
as previously described.24,25 The OncoPanel assay surveys
exonic DNA sequences of 275 cancer genes and detects
copy number variations and structural variants in tumor
DNA.
Statistical Analysis

Patient and clinical characteristics at baseline were summarized as numbers and percentages for categorical variables and medians with interquartile ranges for continuous
variables. All reported toxicities by toxicity type and maximum grade were summarized and sorted by the number
of patients experiencing the toxicity. Toxicities were summarized regardless of attributions as well as with regard to
study treatments. The ORR was summarized as the number and percentage with the 95% confidence interval
(95% CI). The 95% CI was calculated using the exact binomial method. The Kaplan-Meier estimate was used to
summarize the median TTF and OS. The association
between glucose and total cholesterol changes from baseline to cycle 1 and response was summarized using the
Wilcoxon rank sum test.
RESULTS
Patient and Disease Characteristics

Between September 2011 and December 2013, the study
enrolled 32 patients. Two patients who consented were
not able to receive treatment. The majority of patients
had clear cell histology (87%) and 15 patients (50%) had
received 2 prior lines of systemic therapy (Table 1).
With regard to International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) risk groups, the
majority of patients had intermediate-risk disease.
DLTs and Determination of the MDT

The first 6 patients treated in cohorts 1 or 2 did not develop DLTs at the buparlisib doses of 60 mg (3 patients)
or 80 mg (3 patients). At a buparlisib dose of 100 mg, 1
patient in cohort 3 and another patient in cohort 4 developed DLTs (Table 2). Subsequently, the dose was deescalated and another 3 patients were enrolled in cohort 5
with buparlisib administered at a dose of 80 mg per day,
which was determined to be the MTD when given in
combination with bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg,
thereby meeting the primary endpoint of the study.

Fifteen additional patients with mRCC were enrolled at
this dose level and among these, 2 patients developed
DLTs (Table 2). In summary, 3 patients were treated at
the initial buparlisib dose level of 60 mg, 21 patients were
treated at 80 mg, and 6 patients were treated at 100 mg.
Safety and Tolerability

Of the 30 patients who received at least 1 dose of treatment, the median number of cycles administered was 4
(range 1-9 cycles). Overall, 28 patients discontinued therapy: 17 because of disease progression, 7 because of toxicity, and 4 because of other reasons. One death occurred
within 30 days of treatment discontinuation, which was
attributed to progression of disease.
The most frequently reported AEs (any grade) for all
patients included AST elevation (16 patients), fatigue (16
patients), ALT elevation (13 patients), hyperglycemia (13
patients), diarrhea (12 patients), and nausea (11 patients)

Of the 30 treated patients, 4 (13%; 95% CI, 4%-31%)
achieved a partial response and 15 (50%; 95% CI, 31%69%) achieved stable disease (Fig. 2). Six patients (20%)
had progressive disease as their best response and 5 patients
were unevaluable for response (17%). Of the 21 patients
treated at the MTD, 2 (10%; 95% CI, 1%-30%) achieved
a partial response and 10 (48%; 95% CI, 26%-70%)
achieved stable disease as their best response, with 14
patients experiencing some degree of tumor shrinkage. For
the overall cohort, the median TTF was 4 months (95%
CI, 2-9 months) and the median OS was not reached. Of
the 21 patients who were treated at the MTD, the median
TTF was 3 months (95% CI, 2-8 months) and the median
OS was 13 months (95% CI, 4 months to not reached).

criteria, and achieved a median duration of response of 9.2
months (range, 5.5-15 months). Ten patients were able to
receive subsequent therapy, 6 of whom received >2 subsequent lines of treatment after discontinuation of buparlisib
and bevacizumab.
Biomarker Assessment

Of the 9 patients evaluated, 2 had activating
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic
subunit alpha (PIK3CA) mutations. Both hotspot mutations were c.3140A>G (H1047R). In term of outcomes,
one patient achieved a partial response with 42% tumor
shrinkage (TTF of 13 months) and the other achieved stable disease with 16% tumor shrinkage (TTF of 9
months). Both patients had clear cell histology and
IMDC poor risk disease.
Biomarker samples were available for metabolic
analysis in 27 of 30 patients. A correlation between the
percentage change in glucose with the ORR was observed.
Patients who developed elevations in fasting glucose levels
from baseline (4 patients; median change of 130% [7%,
48%]) were more likely to have an objective response
compared with patients without an increase from baseline
(23 patients; median change of -4% [9%, -16%])
(P 5 .04). There was no significant correlation noted
between changes in lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides,
or low-density lipoprotein) and tumor response.
DISCUSSION
The results from this phase 1B study provide evidence
that buparlisib at the MTD of 80 mg daily combined
with bevacizumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks
is safe and tolerable in patients with mRCC. We demonstrated that therapy with the combination of buparlisib and bevacizumab was feasible and toxicity was
manageable.
The most common serious AEs were hepatic enzyme
abnormalities, fatigue, and hypertension. Although hepatitis was mainly attributed to buparlisib, it is uncertain to
what degree fatigue and hypertension may be attributed to
buparlisib, bevacizumab, or both. The rates of grade 3 to 4
fatigue and hypertension demonstrated in phase 3 studies
of bevacizumab with interferon were 12% and 3%, respectively, which is similar to the current study findings regarding bevacizumab in combination with buparlisib.4
With regard to all grade toxicities, hyperglycemia
and diarrhea, which were attributed to buparlisib, were
common but well tolerated. Psychiatric adverse
events, which have been reported with PI3K inhibitors in
approximately 30% of patients in early-phase clinical triCancer

als, consisted of anxiety and depression. In the current
study, the rate of psychiatric AEs was 43% (13 patients),
although 11 of 13 patients had grade 1 anxiety or depression. The mood questionnaires did not indicate major
changes with time, although mood disorders produced 2
DLTs in the escalation cohort. Additional DLTs noted in
the current study were anorexia and pruritus, which were
manageable and have been previously described with
PI3K inhibitors.26
To overcome resistance to VEGF-targeted therapies
and improve clinical outcomes, a wide variety of combinatorial treatment strategies have been investigated in
patients with mRCC. Efforts to combine agents including
tyrosine kinase inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors have
been generally limited due to serious and overlapping toxicities. Combinations of sunitinib with temsirolimus and
bevacizumab demonstrated intolerable toxicity: DLTs
were observed at low starting doses of both agents, with all
grade hypertension of approximately 92%.19,27 In the
current study, we demonstrated that the combination of
buparlisip and bevacizumab was safe and tolerable.
Indeed, bevacizumab has been shown to be a feasible compound to use in combination with other agents given that
as a monoclonal antibody it has fewer overlapping toxicities. It has been used safety with high-dose interleukin 2,
mTOR inhibitors, or novel compounds such as TRC105
(antiendoglin immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody).15,28-30 In future combinatorial studies, bevacizumab may be an agent of choice for VEGF inhibition.
Currently, bevacizumab also is being explored in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors in patients
with mRCC; a phase 3 clinical trial of MPDL3280A
(antiprogrammed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] antibody) in
combination with bevacizumab versus sunitinib is already
ongoing in patients with untreated advanced RCC (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02420821).
PI3K inhibitors may be promising drugs with which
to overcome VEGF resistance in patients with mRCC.
The 3 main classes of PI3K inhibitors, according to the
substrate they target, are dual pan-class I PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors, pan-class I PI3K inhibitors lacking significant
mTOR activity, and isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors.31
PI3K inhibitors also currently are being studied with different combinations including chemotherapy (eg, combined with carboplatin-pemetrexed in lung cancer),
hormonal therapy (eg, combined with fulvestrant or letrozol in breast cancer), targeted therapy (eg, combined with
cetuximab in head and neck tumors), or radiotherapy
(eg, thymoma).32 Specifically, buparlisib is being tested
across several tumor types such as breast cancer, lung

cancer, and thymoma.32 In solid tumors including
mRCC, preliminary data have demonstrated that buparlisib combined with the MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib
demonstrated early signs of antitumor activity, but toxicity was significant.33 Although combined PI3K/mTOR
inhibitors have demonstrated a more profound effect on
cellular proliferation in preclinical RCC models, their
clinical progress has been limited by toxicity in earlyphase studies.34,35
In the current study, the combination of buparlisib
and bevacizumab demonstrated antitumor activity in this
cohort of heavily pretreated patients with mRCC.
Although comparisons with other clinical trials can be
flawed, the objective responses were somewhat lower compared with the combination of bevacizumab and mTOR
inhibitors. Both everolimus and temsirolimus with bevacizumab have shown objective responses in approximately
23% of pretreated patients with mRCC compared with
only 13% in the current study,36,37 although the current
study population was more heavily pretreated.
Precision medicine platforms can identify molecular
drivers of disease for the application of personalized
approaches for cancer therapeutics.25 Recent efforts have
been devoted to characterizing the genomic landscape of
mRCC with the goal of discovering potentially clinically
relevant, actionable genes.38 Despite the identification of
recurrent mutations beyond VHL (such as polybromo 1
[PBRM1], SET domain-containing 2 [SETD2], or
BRCA1-associated protein 1 [BAP1]), to our knowledge
there currently is no evidence that clinical practice should
be modified based on the presence of these mutations.
Integrated molecular analysis (eg, performing wholeexome sequencing) may be the required step for appropriate biomarker selection.39 Indeed, Janku et al showed that
heavily pretreated patients with advanced solid tumors
harboring activating PIK3CA mutations may be sensitive
to therapeutic targeting with PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway
inhibitors.40 Overall, based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and other sources, PIK3CA mutations in both
localized and metastatic disease appear to be uncommon
(<5%) in patients with RCC.10,41 In the current study, 2
of 9 patients with genomic data (22%) harbored PIK3CA
mutations and achieved clinical benefit from treatment.
In addition, some patients demonstrated mutations
known to be harbored in RCC, including VHL and
BAP1, but no associations with response were found.
Unfortunately, given the limited number of patients with
genomic data in the current study, no other alterations
were identified that may serve as predictors of response to
therapy. Experimental data have suggested that additional
2396

biomarkers, yet to be defined, are required beyond PI3K
status to predict response to these compounds.42
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical role
in insulin signaling and glucose homeostasis.43 Hyperglycemia is a class effect observed with PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibition. This metabolic alteration is secondary to a
fasting state characterized by reduced use of glucose and
predilection for fatty acid metabolism.44 We measured
metabolic AEs (hyperlipidemia and hyperglycemia) and
correlated levels with response. Glycemic changes
appeared to correlate with response and may be considered a predictive clinical biomarker of response. This observation parallels the association between the early onset
of hyperglycemia and clinical benefit described with
everolimus.45
In recent years, the treatment of RCC has focused
largely on the inhibition of VEGF pathways. The PI3K
pathway, which is recurrently altered in RCC, may be an
escape mechanism for resistance to anti-VEGF therapies.
The safety profile and antitumor activity of this combination leads us to believe that a subset of patients harboring
PI3K mutations may derive benefit from buparlisib and
that increased fasting blood sugars may be an early predictor of activity. The results of the current study provide important pharmacologic and toxicity data with which to
potentially explore this combination further in a preselected patient population.
