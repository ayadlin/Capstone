ABSTRACT
Cetuximab is an approved treatment for metastatic colorectal carcinoma
(mCRC) with codon 12/13-KRAS mutations, recently questioned for its validity, and
alternative mutation-based biomarkers were proposed. We set out to investigate
whether an expression signature can also predict response by utilizing a cetuximab
mouse clinical trial (MCT) dataset on a cohort of 25 randomly selected EGFR+ CRC
patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). While we found that the expression of EGFR
and its ligands are not predictive of the cetuximab response, we tested a published
RAS pathway signature, a 147-gene expression signature proposed to describe RAS
pathway activity, against this MCT dataset. Interestingly, our study showed that the
observed cetuximab activity has a strong correlation with the RAS pathway signature
score, which was also demonstrated to have a certain degree of correlation with a
historic clinical dataset. Altogether, the independent validations in unrelated datasets
from independent cohort of CRCs strongly suggest that RAS pathway signature may
be a relevant expression signature predictive of CRC response to cetuximab. Our
data seem to suggest that an mRNA expressing signature may also be developed as
a predictive biomarker for drug response, similarly to genetic mutations.

clinical trial (MCT) using a cohort of randomly selected
CRC patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) also clearly
supported the same conclusion [7, 8]. Second, a number
of new alternative mutation based signatures have been
proposed to be better predictive of response to cetuximab
[7, 8], including the activating mutations [2] of EGFR and
BRAF (e.g. V600E) [2, 9], activation of ERBB2 signaling
[10], KRAS mutations [2, 4, 11], PDGFRA and MAP2K1
[8], and composite mutation signatures of specific sets of
oncogene mutation alleles. In practice, caution has been
advised on the use of cetuximab in some KRAS-12/13
wild type patients.
There are many genetic and epigenetic properties of
cancers that can be potentially monitored for predicting
drug responses. However, it seems that only genetic
alterations in DNA have some success in general. For
example, EGFR activating mutation for EGFR-TKIs in
lung cancer [12–14], c-met amplification in lung cancer for
MET-TKI [13], ALK fusion for ALK-TKI in lung cancer

INTRODUCTION
EGFR-targeting monoclonal antibodies, such as
cetuximab (Erbitux®) [1, 2], are important standard of
care (SOC) targeted therapies for treating metastatic
colorectal carcinoma (mCRC), excluding those with
KRAS mutations at codons 12 and 13, and offer clinical
benefit for a subset of mCRC patients [3]. However, only
35~50% of wild-type KRAS CRC patients responded
to cetuximab [2, 4] and only ~10% of mCRC patients
respond to cetuximab monotherapy as a second line
treatment [5]. Importantly, several reports have suggested
that the “KRAS 12/13 rule” is not an optimal criterion
for the clinical use of cetuximab for treating CRC [2],
but an alternative gene mutation signature might be more
predictive. First, a recent retrospective analysis of multiple
phase-III trials unexpectedly concluded that patients with
KRAS codon 13 mutation (G13D) seem to benefit from
the treatment [6], and our recent observation on a mouse

[15], HER2 amplification in gastric and breast cancers
for Herceptin®, etc. In contrast, there are few epigenetic
predictive biomarkers, e.g. gene expression in mRNA, that
were validated for reasons to be elucidated. Several reports
have suggested some epigenetic alterations predictive
of cetuximab response, either positively or negatively,
including gene amplification/over-expression of EGFR or
its ligands, epiregulin (EREG) and amphiregulin (AREG)
[3, 16]. With conflicting and inconclusive observations so
far, it remains a challenge to predict the responders using
expression based criteria.
We have explored predictive biomarkers for CRCcetuximab response using MCT datasets, not only those
based on genetic alterations [7], but also those based on
gene expression. The present study tested the Loboda RAS
pathway signature for its correlation with response in our
MCT of a cohort of 25 EGFR-expressing CRC PDXs [7],
and revealed that the RAS pathway signature [17] seems
to predict CRC response to cetuximab, consistent with
recent clinical data [17].

allele is in question with regard to CRC response to
cetuximab [7], the activation status of the RAS signaling
pathway downstream of EGFR could still play a role
in clinical response to anti-EGFR therapies [21]. By
analyzing three previously generated gene lists for scoring
RAS signaling activity per expression profiling, Loboda
and colleagues described an empirically-derived gene
expression signature of RAS pathway activity based on the
relative expression levels of 147 genes [17], so called the
“RAS pathway signature”. These authors showed that their
signature score may be more predictive of RAS pathway
activity than KRAS mutation status, and that seems to
have some correlation with the efficacy of cetuximab in
treated mCRC patients by retrospective analysis using
a published clinical dataset [17, 18] (Supplementary
Figure S1).
We therefore assessed the RAS pathway signature
scores [17] of the 25 CRC-PDXs from the cohort tested
for cetuximab sensitivity in a MCT setting [7] (Table
1). We found that KRAS 12/13 mutants and wild types
have similar pattern of RAS Signature scores, and
there is no statistical difference between their means
(Welch’s two-sided t-test p-value=0.34, Figure 2A),
suggesting that indeed KRAS 12/13 mutation status
has insignificant correlation with RAS signature scores.
When the cetuximab response was measured by ΔT/ΔC, we
observed a tight correlation between ΔT/ΔC and the RAS
pathway signature scores with Pearson’s correlation r =
0.59 and p-value=0.0018 (Figure 2B). Furthermore, we
observed a correlation of r = 0.69 and p-value=0.004 for
KRAS 12/13-wild type (Figure 2C), and r = 0. 62 and
p-value= 0.05 for KRAS 12/13 mutants (Figure  2D).
Such correlations on a completely independent cohort
can hardly be explained by coincidence, and thus
suggesting that the RAS pathway signature score, or
RAS signaling for that matter, predicts the response of
CRC-PDX to cetuximab. It is particularly interesting
to note 6 of 15 KRAS-12/13-wild type PDXs have
positive RAS pathway scores and are also associated
with poor response (Table 1, Figure 2C). This implies
that mechanisms other than KRAS 12/13-activating
mutations can also up-regulate RAS signaling, consistent
with previous report [7]. Similarly, 4 of 10 KRAS 12/13
mutants have negative scores and are associated with a
certain degree of cetuximab sensitiveness.

RESULTS
Expression of EGFR and its ligands seems to
have little influence on cetuximab response in
CRC-PDX
We were first interested in testing certain proposed
expression biomarkers predictive of cetuximab response
in CRC patients, including AREG and EREG expression
[16, 18], using PDX based MCT datasets. We recently
described a MCT using a cohort of 25 CRC-PDXs [7].
We examined the mRNA levels of EGFR/AREG/EREG
genes, determined by transcriptome sequencing (RNAseq) analysis. However, the data did not point to any
apparent correlation with the response to cetuximab as
measured by ∆T/∆C (Figure 1). Copy numbers of EGFR/
AREG/EREG genes, determined by Affymetrix SNP6.0
chip analysis, did not show correlation in the tested
PDXs, either (Figure 1). These results are consistent with
the clinical observations [19, 20].

RAS pathway signature seems to describe
correlation with cetuximab response in this
cohort of CRC-PDXs

DISCUSSION

KRAS mutations are common in CRC, suggesting
the close involvement of KRAS activity in CRC
pathogenesis [7]. RAS gene mutations, e.g. KRAS and
BRAF, have also been associated with resistance to
cetuximab [7]. We therefore reasoned that gene expression
profiles related to RAS pathway activity may have a
certain relationship to cetuximab response. On the other
hand, although the absolute role of each KRAS mutation

While molecular signatures per genetic alterations
at DNA levels have met some success in predicting drug
response, there seem few successes in identifying/validating
signatures per epigenetic alterations, e.g. at mRNA
expression levels. Our present study adds one even closer
correlation of an independently derived RAS pathway

signature [17], an mRNA signature, to the observed response
to cetuximab per our MCT trial dataset [7], in addition to the
previous observation of correlation in a clinical dataset [17].
In fact, our observed correlation in a MCT dataset is even
stronger than that in the clinical dataset. Again, both datasets
were derived from independent CRC cohorts, strongly
suggesting the validity of this signature.
In repeating their calculations [17], we have
confirmed that the correlation extends to the three Asian
patients in the clinical dataset (Supplementary Figure
S1). These observed correlations of the expression
signature of RAS pathway to cetuximab response
show the same assumed mechanism that downstream
oncogenic signaling does not require an upstream signal
via EGFR, thus cannot be suppressed by cetuximab,
hence cetuximab resistant. The signature predicts both

responders and non-responders, meaning it can be
used to both exclude the non-responders (high scorers)
and include responders (low scorers). In practice, it is
possible that the RAS signature can be combined with
oncogene mutation profiling [7] in the clinic for even
better prediction. For example, patients screened with
wild type KRAS gene can be further subjected to an
mRNA expression profiling of these 147 genes in the
RAS signature, and ones with lower RAS signature
score have higher chance to respond to cetuximab
treatment.
The RAS pathway signature scores as biomarkers
can be readily obtained from biopsy samples from patients
and used as exclusion/inclusion criteria for prospective
clinical trials designed to validate it. Several pieces of
evidence favor the potential success of this type of clinical

trial. In particular, next generation sequencing (NGS),
RNA-seq in this case, with its cost dramatically reduced
recently, enables this 147-gene transcription signature
readily practical in the clinic. Furthermore, a simpler
signature and a companion diagnostic kit could also be
developed.
ΔT
/ΔC, or TGI, is commonly used in preclinical
oncology to get pharmacology readouts. With the
introduction of a MCT concept [7, 22–24], it is important

to determine whether such readouts best predict clinical
readouts. Investigations to address this by evaluating
different “clinically relevant” readouts in a variety of
MCT settings have been attempted. We are also actively
exploring this by examining and comparing different
candidate MCT endpoints at present on a number of MCT
datasets, including this one, hoping to identify the pros
and cons of different endpoints and also the best ones for
certain applications.

RAS pathway signature score calculation
The scores were calculated independently in two
gene expression datasets: 25 PDX samples and 68 samples
with Affymetrix U133A 2.0 array data from clinical
dataset GSE5851 (the latter recapitulates a calculation
originally shown by Laboda et al [17]). The signature
described contains 105 genes in the ‘Up’ set and 42 genes
in the ‘Down’ set, for which we could map 97 genes/and
32 genes respectively on RNA-seq data, and 90 genes
and 33 genes respectively on the HG-U133A 2.0 array.
All gene expression was normalized to have zero mean
and unit variance. The RAS scores were calculated by
subtracting the average expression of ‘Down’ genes from
that of the ‘Up’ genes. A higher score indicates stronger
RAS pathway activation.
