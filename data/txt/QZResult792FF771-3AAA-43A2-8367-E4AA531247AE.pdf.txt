Abstract:

The number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood of metastatic
breast cancer patients is now an established prognostic marker. While the central
nervous system (CNS) is a common site of metastasis in breast cancer, the standard
marker for disease progression in this setting is cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.
However, the significance of CSF cytology is unclear, requires large sample size, is
insensitive and subjective, and sometimes yields equivocal results. Here, we report
the detection of breast cancer cells in CSF using molecular markers by adapting
the CellSearch system (Veridex). We used this platform to isolate and enumerate
breast cancer cells in CSF of breast cancer patients with central nervous system
metastases. The number of CSF tumor cells correlated with tumor response to
chemotherapy and were dynamically associated with disease burden. This CSF tumor
cell detection method provides a semi-automated molecular analysis that vastly
improves the sensitivity, reliability, objectivity, and accuracy of detecting CSF tumor
cells compared to CSF cytology. CSF tumor cells may serve as a marker of disease
progression and early-stage brain metastasis in breast cancer and potentiate further
molecular analysis to elucidate the biology and significance of tumor cells in the CSF.

INTRODUCTION

surrogate marker of treatment response [6, 7]. Giving rise
to the “liquid biopsy”, peripheral blood can be analyzed
for the presence of CTCs using a range of techniques that
are in various stages of development [8]. The CellSearch
system is a CTC detection method that utilizes several
molecular parameters to isolate CTCs: immunomagnetic
enrichment for epithelial cell adhesion molecule
(EpCAM), nuclear staining with 4’, 6-diamidino-2phenylindole (DAPI), and immunofluorescence detection
of cytokeratin and CD45 [9]. Due to its demonstrated
reliability and prognostic value, the CellSearch system
is the only CTC detection platform approved by the US

In the modern era of oncology, cancer-related
mortality is associated with metastatic spread rather
than the voraciousness of the primary tumor [4]. Tumor
seeding in secondary tissues therefore presents a major
challenge in cancer treatment [5]. Therapeutic strategies
are often focused on tumor containment in lieu of
concerns for tumor cell dissemination into surrounding
structures. The enumeration of circulating tumor cells
(CTCs) can monitor the metastatic potential of some solid
tumors, relate these cells to patient survival, and provide a

integration of histopathologic data, the appearance and
severity of neurologic symptoms, and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) of the neuroaxis [14]. To overcome
limitations of currently available clinical parameters, we
developed a reliable detection method to enumerate CSF
tumor cells (CSFTCs) using molecular tumor cell markers
by adapting the CellSearch system. This report describes
this detection method and demonstrates the feasibility and
significance of CTC detection in a pilot study of metastatic
breast cancer patients with CNS metastases.

of CTCs in metastatic colorectal, prostate, and breast
cancers.
The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is an important,
unique, and poorly understood compartment of the central
nervous system (CNS). CSF often acts as a biologic sump
for neurons and glia and is continuously produced and
recycled much like blood or lymph, though never filtered.
Cells from solid tumors can infiltrate the CSF by several
mechanisms including blood-brain barrier penetration by
circulating cells, directly through tumor extension along
Vichow-Robin spaces, or through patterned secondary
structures of Scherer [10, 11]. Tumor cells within the CSF
represent a special subpopulation of malignant cells that
have proven their metastatic potential in peripheral blood
and may be a source of a number of devastating neurologic
sequelae. Current methods for examining the CSF involve
pathological identification of abnormal cells by WrightGiemsa stain. With this method there is no quantification
or characterization of these cells and clinicians must make
judgments on the binary presence or absence of malignant
cells as determined by cytology [12]. This is the gold
standard but lacks molecular analysis and sensitivity, often
requiring repeat testing or high volume analysis [13].
The prognosis and therapeutic stratification of
patients with CNS metastases is currently based on the

RESULTS
Selective detection of breast cancer cells
One of the diagnostic criteria for CTCs as defined
by the CellSearch system is to be EpCAM+. We found
that human glioblastoma cells do not express EpCAM
contrary to breast cancer cells as expected (Figure 1A).
Accordingly, spiking these cultured cells into normal
human blood revealed that the CellSearch system detects
breast cancer cells but not glioblastoma cells (Figure 1BC). This suggests that the CellSearch system could be used
to detect cancer cells in the CSF that are not of glial origin

and therefore those with metastatic potential to the CNS.

CellSearch uses 7.5 mL of peripheral blood for its standard
detection method and relies on several checkpoints and
caveats throughout its processing. One such caveat is
that the tumor cells will be in the buffy coat following
centrifugation of the sample. Due to this, CSF cannot
be directly analyzed in the machine in lieu of blood. We

circumvented this by spiking the cellular contents of
the CSF sample into normal human blood for detection.
This was accomplished by centrifugation of the CSF and
resuspension in a small volume of phosphate buffered
saline (Figure 2). We regularly obtained normal blood
for these assays by procuring leukocyte filters from
blood drives and reconstituting normal blood with a
physiological number of leukocytes. The CSF suspension
was then spiked into the reconstituted blood and subjected
to the standard CellSearch protocol. It is noteworthy that
leukocytes are particularly important for this assay as the
CellSearch system relies on CTCs and contaminating
leukocytes when determining the focal plane for
immunofluorescence analysis. Therefore if a sample with
no CTCs is analyzed, the CellSearch system will abort the
analysis if there are no remaining cells present for locating
the focal plane.

cell numbers and determined the recovery rate at these
various cell counts (Figure 3). We found that the recovery
rate was ~38%, which is similar to that found in other
recovery experiments where cultured human tumor cells
are spiked directly into blood (data not shown). We also
found this recovery rate to be reproducible and linear
across the range of cell numbers tested (R2 = .96).

Detection of CSFTCs in breast cancer patients
with CNS metastases and association with disease
burden
Five patients with metastatic breast cancer involving
the CNS were enrolled into a pilot study (Table 1).
Detecting CSFTCs yielded a number of morphologically
diverse species that included leukocytes, tumor cells,
and significant amount of debris (Figure 4A). Note
that debris is easily separable from tumor cells due to
the immunostaining for a tumor cell marker and is an
important advantage because tumor cells may be more
difficult to distinguish by CSF cytology. Analyzing data
at baseline and following treatment, there was a general
inverse correlation between Karnofsky performance

from headaches, though other symptoms resolved. The
clinical outcome of leptomeningeal or parenchymal CNS
metastases varies greatly. Patients with an excess of
10,000 CSFTCs had cranial nerve deficits or mental status
decline. Two patients showed an improvement in KPS
after chemotherapy initiation and a concomitant decline
in CSFTCs. Our findings from this small pilot study
suggest a possible predictive role for CSFTCs and their
quantification to serve as a reliable marker that reflects
disease burden dynamically unlike CSF cytology and
provides information regarding the magnitude of disease
burden.
Gadolinium-enhanced MRI allows for the sensitive
visualization of macroscopic changes with the brain,
spine or leptomeninges. We found an inverse correlation
with CSFTC count and the presence or enhancement
pattern seen on such imaging. It should be noted that
though neuroimaging is an indicator of CNS disease, it
relies on the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier rather
than a direct sign of response. Multi-modality imaging
is an ever-advancing technology but is not sufficient to
make judgments about cranial and spinal metastases.
CSFTCs represent a novel marker of CNS disease that
detects cancer at the single cell level and provides critical
information to clinicians that attempt to combine cytology,
imaging and neurologic examination as part and parcel of
a treatment algorithm. While this study serves as a proofof-principle and shows promising significance, a larger
cohort of patients with follow up studies will be required
to concretely establish the prognostic significance of
CSFTC enumeration and the ability of therapeutic agents
to eliminate these cells.

status (KPS) of and CSFTC number (r = -.66) (Figure 4B).
There was a general trend toward a higher CSFTC count
with positive CSF cytology (r = -.37) (Figure 4B), though
CSF cytology clearly does not reflect disease burden
(Figure 4C). Subject 5 had >12,000 CSFTCs and on the
same day of CSF collection developed status epilepticus
and deceased. Interestingly this patient showed no gross
abnormalities by MRI that suggested tumor burden and
this underscores the importance of CSFTCs as a disease
marker (Figure 4D). While the correlation between CSFTC
number and Karnofsky performance shows significance in
the pilot study, a large cohort of patients will likely reveal
a stronger significance than can be demonstrated with this
pilot study.

Response to chemotherapy was evident in three
patients that were followed over time in this pilot study
(Figure 5). Subjects 1, 2, and 3 exhibited a significant
decline in the number of CSFTCs following initiation
of intrathecal therapy consisting of a combination of
topotecan, liposomal cytarabine, thiotepa, methotrexate
and/or trastuzumab (Table 1). It should be noted that at
several time-points CSF cytology conducted by a blinded
pathologist gave an equivocal result and that improvements
in KPS tended to follow a decline in CSFTCs. This data
clearly highlights the inability of CSF cytology to reflect
dynamic changes in disease burden.
In addition to its general correlation with KPS,
changes in CSFTC number tended to coincide with
clinical deficits. Prior to treatment initiation, subject
2 had >104 CSFTCs and exhibited facial weakness
and vertical diplopia. These symptoms were resolved
approximately two months after treatment and was
accompanied by a near complete disappearance of
CSFTCs. Subject 3 also harbored >104 CSFTCs and
suffered from severe vomiting, lethargy, and headaches.
Following treatment this patient had a CSFTC count that
declined significantly to 267 CSFTCs but still suffered

DISCUSSION
The biology of metastases and their relationship
to the microenvironment of the CNS remains unclear
[15, 16]. The nature and purpose of malignant cells
from extraneural sites within the CSF compartment also
remains unexplored [17]. Our investigation suggests
that the CSF is a viable source for detecting metastatic
tumor cells in cancer patients with CNS involvement.

Micrometastases to the cerebrospinal compartment and
transmigration through the blood-brain barrier are poorly
understood events[17-20]. Current anti-cancer therapies
are relatively successful for local control of breast cancer
at early stages. However, late-stage and recurrent breast
cancer often metastasizes to the brain [21].
Accurate, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment

underscores the importance of accurately monitoring
common secondary sites by a highly sensitive detection
method. The ability to detect single cells at a metastatic site
such as the brain may allow for therapeutic intervention
that could prevent or destroy metastatic disease an early

concentration was determined using the BioRad protein

of disease. As potentiated by the detection of CSFTCs,
the knowledge that viable cancer remains in the CSF of
patients is highly useful in making treatment decisions.
A number of techniques have been developed for
the isolation of CTCs in peripheral blood since the first
attempts in the late 1800s [23]. Investigational labs
now use several different techniques for CTC detection
including reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,
immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, microchips, and
size-based filtration methods [24-26]. The CellSearch
system presents a platform that reliably captures CTCs in
this setting and provides a semi-automated platform for
enumerating CTCs based on multiple markers to yield
high accuracy, recovery, and reproducibility. Several
studies have demonstrated the clinical significance of CTC
number as a prognostic marker when enumerated by the
CellSearch system in metastatic tumors of breast, colon
and prostate [1, 27, 28]. The isolation and enumeration
of CSFTCs may provide valuable information for patients
with CNS metastasis and potentiate studies on the biology
of these cells and how they differ from the primary and
metastatic tumor as well as the CTCs found in peripheral
blood.
The prognostic relevance of CSFTCs is correlated
here with the clinical course of the patient and the CSFTC
count. The biological significance of finding up to several
thousand CSFTCs in a patient sample remains unclear
though it is suggestive of and correlates with high disease
burden. CNS metastases are often strategically located in
close proximity to ventricular surfaces or CSF cisterns.
However, natural circulation of CSF can be impaired,
which may cause “loculations” of malignant CSF, thus
lowering the diagnostic yield of lumbar puncture [29].
Our lab is currently pursuing post-isolation
characterization of tumor cells isolated from peripheral
blood as well as CSF [30]. There is an expanding though
controversial body of evidence that cancer stem cells play
a large role in the propagation of solid tumors, including
critical mechanisms of metastasis [31-33]. The reliable,
sensitive, and accurate isolation of CSFTCs enables such
studies in conjunction with is potential as a novel marker
that has clear advantages over CSF cytology.

Cell spiking experiments
Tumor cells were harvested from log-phase growth
by trypsinization and enumerated using a Cellometer
(Nexcelom Biosciences) in triplicate. The appropriate
volume of cell suspension was then added to a tube of
CSF previously cleared of tumor cell contaminants
by centrifugation. This CSF was then subjected to the
standard CSFTC detection procedure described below.

Patients
The main inclusion criteria were newly discovered
breast cancer with metastatic disease involving the CNS
as confirmed with radiologic or cytologic findings and the
commencement of intrathecal chemotherapy. All subjects
provided informed consent for testing of their CSF as
approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Penn
State Hershey Medical Center. All subjects were diagnosed
with primary breast cancer prior to enrollment into this
study and had undergone neurosurgical intervention in
terms of placement of a ventricular access device. All
patients had involvement of the CNS, with combinations
of parenchymal or leptomeningeal metastases. The
ventricular access device provided a means to obtain
CSF for testing. Prior to the onset of treatment, patients
underwent thorough neurologic examination to identify
any deficits and were stratified based on KPS. CSF was
obtained every 2 to 3 weeks for each patient and often
coincided with intrathecal chemotherapy deposition. The
neuro-oncologist providing treatment and evaluating the
patients was blinded to the CSFTC analysis.

was resuspended in 1mL of PBS. The suspension was
then spiked into 6.5mL of reconstituted normal human
blood. This blood was obtained from leukocyte filters
that were generated from blood drives as approved by
the Institutional Review Board at Penn State Hershey

Medical Center. 6.5mL of filtered blood was removed
from the leukocyte trap, placed into a CellSave (Veridex)
tube, and inverted 8 times. The leukocyte filter was rinsed
with PBS and back-flushed to obtain leukocytes that were
enumerated and spiked at 107 cells per 6.5mL sample of
blood. Samples were analyzed within 3 days using the
standard CellSearch protocol and the CTC Epithelial Cell
Kit (Veridex). In brief, the CellSearch system qualifies a
cell as a CTC if it has an evident nucleus by DAPI staining
and is EpCAM+, cytokeratin+, and CD45-. Analysis and
enumeration of CTCs was conducted by a blinded,
certified assay operator.
