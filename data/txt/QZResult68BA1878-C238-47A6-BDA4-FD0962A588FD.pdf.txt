ABSTRACT
The HSP90 chaperone TRAP1 is translational regulator of BRAF synthesis/
ubiquitination, since BRAF down-regulation, ERK signaling inhibition and delay of cell
cycle progression occur upon TRAP1 silencing/inhibition. Since TRAP1 is upregulated in
human colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) and involved in protection from apoptosis and as
human BRAF-driven CRCs are poorly responsive to anticancer therapies, the relationship
between TRAP1 regulation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and BRAF antiapoptotic
signaling has been further evaluated. This study reports that BRAF cytoprotective
signaling involves TRAP1-dependent inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.
It is worth noting that BRAF and TRAP1 interact and that the activation of BRAF
signaling results in enhanced TRAP1 serine-phosphorylation, a condition associated
with resistance to apoptosis. Consistently, a BRAF dominant-negative mutant prevents
TRAP1 serine phosphorylation and restores drug sensitivity in BRAFV600E CRC drugresistant cells with high TRAP1 levels. In addition, TRAP1 targeting by the mitochondriadirected HSP90 chaperones inhibitor gamitrinib induces apoptosis and inhibits colony
formation in BRAF-driven CRC cells. Thus, TRAP1 is a downstream effector of BRAF
cytoprotective pathway in mitochondria and TRAP1 targeting may represent a novel
strategy to improve the activity of proapoptotic agents in BRAF-driven CRC cells.

the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [6–8], the latter
being consistent with the apoptosis-resistant phenotype
of BRAF-driven cancer cells. In this perspective, BRAF
translocation to mitochondria represents a prerequisite
for enabling resistance to apoptosis and this results in
inhibition of cytochrome c release and inactivation of the
caspase cascade [7], although the molecular mechanisms of
BRAF antiapoptotic responses in mitochondria are not fully
elucidated. From a clinical perspective, BRAF-mutated
colorectal carcinomas (CRCs) are frequently addicted to this
mitochondrial survival pathway, resistant to apoptosis and
poorly responsive to standard chemotherapeutics and EGFR

INTRODUCTION
BRAF is one of the top12 mutant genes in human
malignancies, with the substitution at position 600 from a
valine to a glutamic acid (BRAF-V600E) the most common
[1, 2]. Human BRAF-driven tumors, mostly melanomas,
and thyroid and colorectal carcinomas, are biologically
and clinically aggressive malignancies, frequently resistant
to conventional anticancer therapies [3, 4]. Indeed, the
oncogenic activation of BRAF drives the inappropriate
activation of ERK signaling and the deregulation of cell
proliferation [5], and is responsible for the inhibition of

monoclonals [9–11]. Thus, the molecular characterization
of BRAF-dependent antiapoptotic mechanisms is the
prerequisite for targeting the BRAF survival pathway, thus
representing a major clinical need, based on the lack of
appropriate and effective treatments for these tumors [11].
Recent evidence by our group suggests that TRAP1
is responsible for the translational regulation of BRAF
synthesis/ubiquitination in CRC cells [12]. Indeed,
TRAP1 is a molecular chaperone, a member of the
HSP90 chaperone family, involved in the maintenance of
mitochondrial integrity and regulation of mitochondrial
transition pore (MTP) [13], and upregulated in several
human malignancies including CRCs [13–16]. Several
lines of evidence suggest that TRAP1 is responsible for
dual control on mitochondrial apoptotic pathway: i) folding/
stability regulation on cyclophillin D and, likely, other client
proteins critical for MTP opening within mitochondria
[13, 17, 18], and ii) quality control regulation on specific
client proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), most of
which are extremely important regulators of mitochondrial
apoptosis [15, 18–20]. In this context, our group has
previously demonstrated that TRAP1 i) interacts with the
proteasome regulatory protein particle TBP7 in the ER, ii) is
involved in extra-mitochondrial quality control of nuclearencoded proteins through co-translational regulation of their
ubiquitination/synthesis, and iii) induces parallel activation
of a cytoprotective UPR response and consequent protection
from apoptosis [15, 19]. In this context, BRAF synthesis/
ubiquitination is tightly regulated by ER-associated TRAP1,
as an additional and non redundant mechanism respect to
HSP90 control of BRAF stability [12, 21]. Intriguingly,
while BRAF synthesis is induced in a TRAP1-rich
background, its ubiquitination is enhanced upon disruption
of TRAP1 network, in correlation to decreased protein
levels. It is worth noting that this regulation is conserved in
human malignancies, since the two proteins are significantly
co-expressed in human CRCs, thus representing a potential
therapeutic window for tumor-selective targeting of BRAFdriven colorectal malignancies [12].
Based on this well-characterized TRAP1 cyto­
protective network and the knowledge that the RASRAF-ERK axis drives extracellular survival stimuli to
mitochondria [4], we evaluated the relationship between
TRAP1 regulation of MTP and BRAF signaling in
mitochondria, with this study reporting that TRAP1 is a
downstream effector of the BRAF cytoprotective pathway.

sensitivity of BRAF-mutated compared to BRAF-wild
type (wt) human CRC cell lines. Indeed, BRAF-V600E
HT29 and COLO205 cells showed poor sensitivity
to oxaliplatin (l-OHP) and irinotecan (IRI) compared
to BRAF-wt COLO320 cells (Figure 1A), as well as
transfection of either BRAF-wt or the BRAF-V600E
mutant in COLO320 cells resulted in reduced sensitivity
to l-OHP and IRI (Figure 1B). Consistently, BRAF
silencing increased l-OHP-induced apoptotic cell
death in BRAF-V600E HT29 cells to an extent similar
to TRAP1 silencing (Figure 1C). In order to explore
further whether BRAF antiapoptotic response involves
inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, l-OHPinduced mitochondrial depolarization was evaluated
in BRAF-wt COLO320 in comparison to BRAFV600E HT29 cells (Figure 2A), and in COLO320 cells
transfected with BRAF-wt or BRAF-V600E constructs
(Figure 2B). In actual fact, BRAF-V600E HT29 cells
exhibited higher mitochondrial basal polarization and
reduced depolarization in response to l-OHP compared
to COLO320 cells (Figure 2A), as well as upregulation
of BRAF-wt or the BRAF-V600E constructs protected
from mitochondrial depolarization in COLO320 cells
upon exposure to l-OHP (Figure 2B). These data suggest
that BRAF protects from apoptosis by inhibiting the
mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

The antiapoptotic function of BRAF is TRAP1dependent
BRAF subcellular compartmentalization was
evaluated in TRAP1-silenced COLO320 cells, since it has
been suggested that BRAF signaling alters cell responses
to apoptotic stimuli upon traslocation to mitochondria [7]
and that TRAP1 regulates BRAF expression/ubiquitination
at the translational level [12]. Indeed, TRAP1 silencing
resulted in the downregulation of endogenous BRAF in
both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions (Figure 3A).
In parallel experiments, cDNAs encoding for BRAFwt or its V600E mutant were transfected in scramble and
shTRAP1 CRC HCT116 cells and cell lysates evaluated
for BRAF expression. It is noteworthy that stable TRAP1
interference resulted in lower BRAF mitochondrial basal
levels and reduced BRAF upregulation upon transfection
of both wild type and V600E constructs (Figure 3B). This
evidence is consistent with our previous observation of
lower BRAF levels and ERK activation in TRAP1-silenced
CRC COLO320 cells transfected with BRAF-wt and BRAFV600E constructs [12], suggesting that BRAF mitochondrial
levels are reduced in a TRAP1-low background.
Considering that mitochondrial TRAP1 is
responsible for cytoprotective responses based on its
capacity to protect cells from the opening of the MTP
[13], we subsequently questioned whether the BRAF
antiapoptotic function is TRAP1-dependent. To this aim,
drug-induced apoptosis was evaluated in shTRAP1 CRC
HCT116 (Figure 3C and Supplementary Figure 1A)

Figure 1B–1C) cells upon transfection of either
BRAF-wt or BRAF-V600E constructs. Indeed, the
up-regulation of both BRAF-wt and V600E constructs
failed to protect against l-OHP- or paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis in shTRAP1 HCT116 (Figure 3C and
Supplementary Figure 1A) and MCF7 (Supplementary
Figure 1B–1C) cells. Consistently, the upregulation of
BRAF-V600E mutant failed to protect from l-OHPinduced mitochondrial depolarization (Figure 3D) in
shTRAP1 HCT116 cells. These data suggest that BRAF
cytoprotective function requires TRAP1 antiapoptotic
activity.

Interestingly, the immunoblot analysis showed a band
of 75kDa immunoreactive with TRAP1 antibody upon
immunoprecipitation of both BRAF-wt and BRAF-V600E
(Figure 4A). In reciprocal experiments, TRAP1 and BRAF
co-ip was confirmed in total lysates of BC MCF7 cells
co-transfected with TRAP1 and BRAF upon TRAP1
immunoprecipitation (Figure 4B).
As BRAF is a serine/threonine kinase responsible
for the phosphorylation of several intracellular specific
substrates [2], we further evaluated whether the acti­
vation of BRAF signaling correlates with enhanced
TRAP1 serine-phosphorylation. BRAF-wt CaCo2 cells
were transfected with TRAP1 alone or co-transfected
with TRAP1 and BRAF-wt or the V600E mutant and
immunoprecipitated with TRAP1 antibody. Interestingly,
TRAP1 immunoblot analysis showed a TRAP1-specific
additional band, mostly evident in BRAF and TRAP1
co-transfectants (Figure 5A). It is worth noting that the
upper band of the TRAP1 doublet is enhanced in cells cotransfected with the BRAF-V600E constitutively active
mutant, also detectable in total lysate (Figure 5A, input).

in inducing TRAP1 serine phosphorylation, CaCo2
cells were co-transfected with TRAP1 and a mutant of
BRAF acting as dominant negative (BRAF-dn) [22] or
the BRAF-V600E construct. Interestingly, the BRAFdn mutant downregulated ERK phosphorylation in total
lysates and prevented TRAP1 serine-phosphorylation,
as induced by the BRAF-V600E mutant (Figure 5B). In
order to determine whether this TRAP1 doublet is serine
phosphorylated, TRAP1 and the BRAF-V600E mutant
were co-transfected in HT29 cells (Figure 5C, right panel)
and total lysates were immunoprecipitated with either antiTRAP1 or anti-phosphoserine antibodies and resolved
by SDS-PAGE in the same gel (Figure 5C, left panel).
Interestingly, TRAP1 immunoblot analysis recognized the
75kDa doublet in both immunoprecipitates (Figure 5C, left
panel). Taken as a whole, these data suggest that TRAP1
serine phosphorylation is enhanced in a high BRAF
background.

The relevance of TRAP1 serine phosphorylation
for antiapoptotic activity was further evaluated in
BRAF-V600E IRI-resistant HT29 cells, a tumor cell
line characterized by higher TRAP1 levels compared
to its drug-sensitive counterpart (Figure 6A) [14] and,
thus, suitable for the study of phosphorylation levels of
endogenous TRAP1 and the relevance of TRAP1 serinephosphorylation for antiapoptotic activity. Of note, the
transfection of BRAF-dn mutant resulted in reduced serinephosphorylation of endogenous TRAP1 in IRI-resistant
cells (Figure 6B), and rescued sensitivity of IRI-resistant
HT29 cells to the specific anticancer agent to an extent
similar to BRAF inhibition by vemurafenib (Figure 6C and
Supplementary Figure 2A–2B). In parallel experiments,
BRAF inhibition/silencing resulted in higher apoptotic

(Figure 6D and Supplementary Figure 2C). Finally, the
relevance of BRAF for TRAP1 cytoprotective activity was
explored by re-expressing TRAP1 in shTRAP1 HCT116
cells upon transient BRAF silencing (Supplementary
Figure 2D). It is worth noting here that TRAP1
upregulation protected scramble and shTRAP1 cells from
irinotecan-induced apoptosis, whereas its cytoprotective
activity was lost in tumor cell lines silenced for BRAF
(Figure 6E). These data suggest that TRAP1 antiapoptotic
activity is enhanced in a BRAF-rich background and is
likely connected to its serine phosphorylation.

(Figure 7C). Interestingly, HSP90 chaperone inhibition
significantly reduced viability of BRAF-V600E HT29
cells compared to BRAF-wt COLO320 cells (Figure 7A)
and induced higher levels of apoptosis in BRAF-V600E
drug-sensitive and drug-resistant BRAF-mutated cell
lines (Figure 7B). Colony- and foci-forming ability was
tested in HT29 and HCT116 cells exposed to gamitrinib
for 24 h after seeding. Interestingly, gamitrinib inhibited
foci (Figure 7C) and colony (Figure 7D) formation in both
tumor cell lines, with BRAF-V600E HT29 cells treated
with gamitrinib showing a significantly lower colony/
foci forming ability compared to BRAF-wt HCT116
cells (Figure 7C–7D). These data suggest that HSP90
chaperones targeting may represent a potential therapeutic
strategy in BRAF-addicted CRC cell lines.

BRAF-addicted colorectal carcinoma cells are
highly sensitive to HSP90 chaperones inhibition
Since previous data suggest that BRAF protection
from apoptosis is TRAP1-dependent, we questioned
whether BRAF-mutated CRC cells are more sensitive
to TRAP1 inhibition. To this aim, BRAF-V600E and
BRAF-wt CRC cells were exposed to sub-cytotoxic
concentrations of the HSP90/TRAP1 dual inhibitor
gamitrinib and evaluated for cell viability (Figure 7A),

DISCUSSION
Aberrant activation of the RAS/RAF/ERK axis
is responsible for favoring several features of human
malignancies [2, 3, 5], including uncontrolled cell proli­
feration, cell survival and metastatic behavior [3, 5].

Furthermore, data overwhelmingly suggest that this
pathway is aberrantly activated in human cancer, mostly
by mutations of EGFR or RAS and RAF downstream
components [5]. Intriguingly, both RAF and ERK
translocate to mitochondria where they are involved in
cytoprotective functions. Indeed, mitochondrial ERK
is responsible for MTP desensitization and resistance to
cell death through the modulation of glycogen synthase
kinase-3-dependent phosphorylation of the pore regulator
cyclophilin D [23]. Furthermore, activated BRAF
promotes cell survival by inducing the expression or the
phosphorylation of BCL-2 family members [24, 25] and
suppresses apoptotic responses against staurosporine
and TNFα/cycloheximide in thyroid carcinoma cells
[7]. Interestingly, mitochondrial BRAF-V600E inhibits
cytochrome c release from mitochondria, favoring
resistance to apoptosis. This activity is unaffected by
inhibition of ERK activity [7], thus suggesting that mutant
BRAF might be responsible by itself for altered responses
to apoptotic stimuli within mitochondria. In the clinical
perspective, BRAF oncogenic activation confers a worse
prognosis to human colorectal [26–29] and thyroid [30]
carcinomas and melanomas [31, 32] and is linked to
unresponsiveness to traditional and molecular targeted
anticancer agents [9–11] and radioiodine [33].

Based on our recent observation that BRAF is a client
protein of TRAP1 [12], an HSP90 molecular chaperone
upregulated in several human cancers including CRC [13–
16], we evaluated the molecular mechanisms responsible
for resistance to apoptosis induced by BRAF activation in
human CRCs. Our data suggest that i) BRAF antiapoptotic
activity involves inhibition of the MTP opening and is
TRAP1-dependent, ii) TRAP1 and BRAF interact, with
BRAF signaling activation correlated with TRAP1 serine
phosphorylation, iii) TRAP1 serine phosphorylation likely
favors its antiapoptotic activity and iv) BRAF-addicted CRC
cell lines are highly sensitive to both BRAF and TRAP1
targeting. Accordingly, this study verifies the concept that
inhibition of TRAP1 chaperoning activity represents a
strategy for targeting dependency of BRAF-addicted tumor
cells on TRAP1 quality control and antiapoptotic pathway.
These data provide new evidence regarding the
reciprocal regulation between TRAP1 chaperoning
functions and the BRAF signaling pathway. In previous
studies we demonstrated that BRAF synthesis/ubiquiti­
nation is regulated at the translational level by TRAP1
in ER [12]. Thus, BRAF expression is enhanced in a
high TRAP1 background in vitro and in human CRCs.
Additionally, TRAP1 silencing/inhibition correlates with
lower BRAF synthesis and increase of its ubiquitination,

reduced ERK activation, arrest of cell cycle in G0-G1 and
G2-M transitions along with wide reprogramming of gene
expression with down-regulation of several genes involved
in cell cycle progression [12]. Here, consistent with
previous observations, we report that BRAF mitochondrial
expression and its capacity to inhibit the opening of the
MTP and protect from apoptosis are significantly impaired
in a low TRAP1 background. Thus, our findings suggest
that, in addition to the previously described TRAP1
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

regulation on BRAF synthesis/ubiquitination in the ER [12],
further control exists since TRAP1 represents a downstream
effector of BRAF cytoprotective pathway in mitochondria.
Indeed, BRAF signaling activation results in induction
of TRAP1 serine phosphorylation, which likely enables
TRAP1 antiapoptotic function through inhibition of the
MTP opening. In such a scenario, the regulation of TRAP1
function by BRAF likely contributes to the enhancement
of the apoptotic threshold of cancer cells and induces drug

resistance in human BRAF-driven malignancies with
TRAP1 upregulation, through the downstream inhibition
of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. At the same time,
TRAP1 overexpression likely represents a mechanism to
enhance BRAF synthesis, reduce its ubiquitination and
activate its downstream signaling through the ER quality
control function [12]. Accordingly, our data suggest dual
and reciprocal regulation between the TRAP1 antiapoptotic
network and BRAF signaling, likely to be relevant in
favoring the apoptosis resistant phenotype shown by human
BRAF-mutated malignancies. Still unsolved is the question
as to whether TRAP1 is directly phosphorylated by BRAF
or by other signaling molecules downstream to BRAF and
whether this occurs within or outside mitochondria. The
hypothesis that intermediate signaling molecules might

mediate TRAP1 serine phosphorylation upon activation of
BRAF signaling cannot be ruled out, and represents an issue
that merits further investigation.
It is intriguing that the dependency on TRAP1
quality control and survival pathway may represent a
mechanism of addiction in BRAF-mutated CRC cells.
Consistently with previous data from Altieri’s group
showing that BRAF-mutated melanoma cells exhibit
increased sensitivity to gamitrinib-induced cell death,
compared to wild type BRAF melanoma cells [17], CRC
cell lines and drug-resistant CRC cells showed high
sensitivity to subcytotoxic concentrations of gamitrinib
with higher apoptotic rates and impaired colony and foci
formation. Furthermore, BRAF inhibition enhanced druginduced cell death in BRAF-addicted CRC cell lines and

prevented TRAP1 serine phosphorylation, as well as reestablishing drug sensitivity in irinotecan-resistant CRC
cells, thus reinforcing the concept that the drug-resistant
phenotype of this tumor cell model is addicted to the
TRAP1/BRAF reciprocal regulatory mechanism. Taken as
a whole, these observations support the notion that TRAP1
quality control and antiapoptotic protein network is a
potential molecular target for anticancer therapy and that
BRAF-addicted tumors are a suitable and attractive tumor
cell model to evaluate this novel therapeutic strategy.
These data are extremely relevant in the perspective to
design new therapeutic strategies and novel combination
therapies of different molecular targeted agents in human
BRAF-driven CRCs, a subset of colorectal tumors with
poor prognosis [26–28] and low response to standard
therapies and EGFR monoclonals [9–11]. Indeed, although
recently the combination of standard chemotherapy with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

bevacizumab has been proposed as the best therapeutic
option for BRAF-mutated advanced CRCs [34], the
prognosis of these patients is still dismal compared to
other molecular subtypes of colon cancers [10, 27]. Thus,
the development of novel effective therapies represents
a clinical need in BRAF-mutant CRCs and, seen in this
light, our data provide a strong rationale to design novel
specific TRAP1 inhibitors and evaluate BRAF mutational
status as a potential biomarker in the selection of tumors
suitable for TRAP1 targeting therapy.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell cultures, constructs, siRNAs and chemicals
Human CRC HCT116, HT29, COLO320, COLO205
and CaCo2 and BC MCF7 cells were purchased from
American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Cell lines
22306

Oncotarget

were routinely monitored in our laboratory by microscopic
morphology, while cell line authentication was verified
before starting this study by STR profiling, according
to ATCC product description. MCF7, HCT116, HT29,
and CaCo2 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 1.5 mM glutamine,
and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin, COLO320 and
COLO205 cells in RPMI medium 1640 supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.75 mM glutamine,
and 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin. TRAP1-stable
interfered CRC HCT116 and BC MCF7 cells [19, 35] and
drug-resistant CRC cell lines [14, 36] were cultured as
previously described.
Full-length TRAP1 construct was obtained as
previously described [19, 35], BRAF-wt, BRAF-V600E
and BRAFdn constructs kindly provided by Prof. Massimo
Santoro (University of Naples Federico II, Naples, Italy)
[22]. All constructs were cloned in pcDNA3.1 vector
(Invitrogen). Transient transfection of DNA plasmids was
performed with Polyfect Transfection reagent (Qiagen),
according to manufacturer protocol.
SiRNAs of TRAP1 and BRAF were purchased
from Qiagen (Cat. No. SI00115150 for TRAP1, Cat. No.
SI00299488 for BRAF). For control experiments, cells were
transfected with a similar amount of control siRNA (Qiagen,
Cat. No.SI03650318). For knock-down experiments,
siRNAs were diluted to a final concentration of 40 nM
and transiently transfected by the HiPerFect Transfection
Reagent (Qiagen), according to manufacturer protocol.
Gamitrinib was kindly provided by Dr. Altieri (The
Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA, USA). Unless otherwise
specified, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

with methanol/acetic acid solution (1:7) and colored with
crystal violet. Density of transformation foci/colonies were
compared by cell counts and represented as average ± SD.

Immunoblot analysis
Total cell lysates were obtained by homogenization
of cell pellets in a cold lysis buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5
containing 300 mM sucrose, 60 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl,
5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1
mM PMSF, 2 mg/ml aprotinin, 2 mg/ml leupetin and 0.2%
(w/v) deoxycholate) for 2 min at 4°C and further sonication
for 30 sec on ice. Mitochondria were purified by Qproteome
Mitochondria Isolation kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer
protocol. Immunoblot analysis was performed as previously
reported [38]. Protein immunoprecipitation was carried out
starting from 1 mg of total protein extracts. Lysates were
pre-cleared by incubating with protein A/G-Agarose (Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies) for 1 h at 4°C and then incubated
with gentle shaking for 18 h at 4°C with specific antibodies,
after which samples were further incubated for 1 h at 4°C
with fresh beads. Beads were collected by centrifugation and
washed twice in lysis buffer. The following antibodies from
Santa Cruz Biotechnology were used: mouse monoclonal
anti-HSP75 (sc-73604), mouse monoclonal anti-cMyc
(sc-40), mouse monoclonal anti-BRAF (sc-5284), mouse
monoclonal anti-GAPDH (sc-47724), mouse monoclonal
anti-Tubulin (sc-8035), mouse monoclonal anti-ATP5B (3D5)
(sc-58618). The following antibodies were also used: mouse
monoclonal anti-phospho44/42 MAPK (pErk1/2, #9106) and
rabbit polyclonal anti-phosphoBRAF (Ser445, #2696) from
Cell Signaling Technology, rabbit polyclonal anti-MAPK 1/2
(Erk1/2, #ABS44), rabbit polyclonal anti-VDAC (#AB10527)
from Merk Millipore; mouse monoclonal anti-phosphoSerine
(#37430) from Qiagen.

Apoptosis assay
Apoptosis was evaluated by citofluorimetric analysis
of Annexin-V and 7-amino-actinomycin-D (7-AAD)-positive
cells using the fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-AnnexinV/7-AAD kit (Beckman Coulter, Milan, Italy). Stained cells
were analyzed using the FACSCaliburTM (Becton Dickinson).
Positive staining for Annexin-V as well as double staining for
Annexin-V and 7-AAD were interpreted as signs of early and
late phases of apoptosis respectively [37].

Mitochondrial membrane potential evaluation
Mitochondrial membrane potential was detected
by using JC-10 Mitochondrial Membrane Potential
Assay Kit – Flow Cytometry (Abcam, ab112133). Cells
were seeded into 6-well plates, treated as indicated in the
Results, trypsinized, washed with PBS and incubated with
JC-10 probe at 37°C for 20 min in the dark. As a control,
cells were pre-incubated with 10 μM carbonyl cyanide
m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) at 37°C for 20 min
to obtain complete mitochondrial depolarization. Cell
fluorescence was measured using the FACSCaliburTM
cytometer (Becton Dickinson) and reported as the ratio
between red and green fluorescence.

Focus and colony forming assays
For focus forming assay, cells were seeded at a density
of 200 cells/well in 6-well plates, treated 24 h later with 10
μM gamitrinib for 24 h, and left at confluence for 15 days
with medium changes every 3 days. For colony formation
assay, 1.25 × 104 cells were suspended in pre-warmed
(40°C) 0.7% agarose solution containing 10% (v/v) FBS
DMEM, seeded on the top of a bottom layer of a 0.8%
agar gel containing 10% (v/v) FBS DMEM, treated with
gamitrinib for 24 h and left growing for 15 days as described
above. Fifteen days after treatment, the plates were fixed

Statistical analysis
Two-sided paired T-test was used to establish
statistical differences in apoptosis, ratio of mitochondrial
depolarization, and colony/foci formation between BRAF22307

Oncotarget

mutated and BRAF-wt cells, transfected/silenced and non
transfected/silenced cells or drug- and vehicle-treated
cells. Statistically significant values (p < 0.05) are reported
in Figure Legends. All experiments were independently
performed at least three times.
