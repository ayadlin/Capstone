ABSTRACT
Nerve and blood vessel ingrowth during intervertebral disc degeneration,
is thought to be a major cause of low back pain, however the regulation of this
process is poorly understood. Here, we investigated the expression and regulation
of a subclass of axonal guidance molecules known as the class 3 semaphorins, and
their receptors; plexins and neuropilins within human NP tissue and their regulation
by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Importantly this determined whether semaphorin
expression was associated with the presence of nerves and blood vessels in tissues
from human intervertebral discs. The study demonstrated that semaphorin3A, 3C,
3D, 3E and 3F and their receptors were expressed by native NP cells and further
demonstrated their expression was regulated by IL-1β but to a lesser extent by IL-6
and TNFα. This is the first study to identify sema3C, sema3D and their receptors within
the nucleus pulposus of intervertebral discs. Immunopositivity shows significant
increases in semaphorin3C, 3D and their receptor neuropilin-2 in degenerate samples
which were shown to contain nerves and blood vessels, compared to non-degenerate
samples without nerves and blood vessels. Therefore data presented here suggests
that semaphorin3C may have a role in promoting innervation and vascularisation
during degeneration, which may go on to cause low back pain.

increased production of matrix degrading enzymes such as
matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs); MMP-3 and -13, and
a disintergrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin
motifs (ADAMTS), -1, -4 and -5 [12–18]. The IVD is
known to become increasingly vascularised by small blood
vessels and innervated by peptide containing sensory nerve
fibres, which are thought to elicit pain [19–21]. This being
said, the mechanisms by which these processes occur are
yet to be fully elucidated.
Current literature surrounding the mechanisms of
low back pain (LBP) associated with neural ingrowth
have focussed on neurotrophic factors which are
known to promote the ingrowth and survival of sensory
nerves, including nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain
derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) [19, 22–29]. To
date however, limited studies have investigated the

INTRODUCTION
The intervertebral disc (IVD) is suggested to be the
largest aneural and avascular tissue within the human body
and is composed of three main anatomical regions; the
gelatinous nucleus pulposus (NP) which is contained by the
annulus fibrosus (AF) and the cartilaginous end plate (CEP).
Chronic low back pain (LBP) is known to affect 80% of
the population during their lifetime, and 40% of these cases
are attributed to IVD degeneration [1]. Disc degeneration is
characterised by the early loss of extracellular matrix (ECM)
as well as altered biomechanical properties caused by an
imbalance between anabolic and catabolic factors [2– 4].
Cytokines, in particular, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumour
necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) are well known for their role
within IVD degeneration [5–12], consequently leading to

potential role of axonal guidance molecules known as
the Semaphorins. There are 8 classes of semaphorins,
yet class 3 Semaphorins are the only secreted members
of the semaphorin family found within vertebrates
[30]. Initially semaphorins were thought to function as
repulsive guidance cues, yet Sema3B and Sema3C have
been postulated to have bi-functional properties involved
in promotion and repulsion of axons [31–33]. Class 3
semaphorins signal their response through two prominent
semaphorin receptors; the neuropilins (NRP) and the
plexins [34–38]. Whilst the majority of membrane bound
semaphorins signal via plexins alone, class 3 semaphorins
require the NRP as an obligate co-receptor, generating a
high affinity holoreceptor complex [34, 37, 38].
Sema3A has previously been identified within human
IVD samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC) [39]. Tolofari
et al., (2010) identified immunopositive disc cells at the
periphery of the outer annulus fibrosus (OAF) within nondegenerate discs, however the number of immunopositive
cells decreased in the OAF and increased within NP cells in
degenerate discs [39]. Suggesting that Sema3A is a natural
inhibitor present within the non-degenerate disc, preventing
innervation and vascularisation. Yet during degeneration,
the loss of Sema3A at the periphery could potentially allow
the inappropriate entry of nerves and blood vessels into
the AF [39]. However to date no studies have investigated
expression of the remaining members of the semaphorins
or their receptors and whether this expression is associated
with the presence of nerves and blood vessels. Hence this
study aimed to identify class 3 semaphorins (Sema3A-F)
and their receptors within human NP tissue and identify
whether their expression was regulated by pro-inflammatory
cytokines. Importantly this study aimed to identify whether
their expression was associated with the presence of nerves
and blood vessels.

(P  =  0.0195), severely degenerate (P = 0.0004) and
infiltrated (P = 0.0169) cohorts in comparison to
non-degenerate cohort (Figure 1C). Sema3E was present
in 100% of severely degenerate samples, a significantly
higher proportion compared to expression in the moderately
degenerate cohort (87%) (P = 0.05) (Figure 1D). Sema3F was
expressed at low levels and present in 44% of non- degenerate
samples, falling significantly to only 7% of moderately
degenerate samples expressing sema3F (P  =  0.0252)
(Figure 1E). The proportion of severely degenerate samples
expressing NRP1 was significantly higher than the number
of non-degenerate samples expressing NRP1 (P = 0.0062)
(Figure 1F). NRP2 was constitutively expressed by 100%
of samples investigated, irrespective of disease classification
(Figure 1G). PA1 was expressed by a significantly higher
proportion of samples in the severely degenerate (P =
0.0448) and infiltrated cohorts (P = 0.0407) compared to nondegenerate samples (Figure  1H). PA2 (Figure 1I) and PA4
(Figure 1K) were expressed by a higher proportion of severely
degenerate samples, compared to non-degenerate samples, yet
this failed to reach significance. PA3 (Figure 1J) was expressed
by 96% of severely degenerate samples, significantly higher
than the number of non-degenerate samples expressing PA3
(P = 0.0197) (Figure 1J).

Cytokine regulation of class 3 semaphorins within
human NP cells, HDMEC and SH-SY5Y cells
Following the identification of class 3 semaphorins
and their receptors within native NP tissue, NP cells derived
from degenerate IVDs were cultured in alginate and
stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines, to determine
modulation by inflammatory cytokines. Following IL-1β
treatment for 48 hours, human NP cells significantly up
regulated their expression of Sema3C at concentrations
≥ 1 pg/mL (P ≤ 0.05) (Figure 2A) and Sema3D at
concentrations ≥ 100 pg/mL (P ≤ 0.0001) (Figure 2A). IL-6
and TNFα treatment in human NP cells failed to regulate
semaphorins (P = > 0.05) (Figure 2B & 2C).
HDMEC stimulation with 10 ng/mL IL-1β signifi­
cantly increased Sema3C (P = 0.0007) whilst sema3A was
significantly decreased (P = 0.0071) (Figure  2D). IL-6,
IL-8 and TNFα failed to regulate semaphorin expression
in HDMEC or SHSY5Y cells, IL-1β also had no effect on
SHSY5Y cells (Figure 2D & 2E).

RESULTS
Identification of class 3 semaphorins and their
receptors within native NP tissue
Directly extracted NP cells were investigated by QRTPCR for the native expression of members of the class 3
semaphorins and their receptors, of which Sema3A, 3C, 3D,
3E and 3F along with NRP’s and Plexins were identified
within IVD tissue, irrespective of their classification.
Sema3B was not identified in any sample. Sema3A
was present in 100% of non-degenerate and degenerate
samples, and 95% of infiltrated samples (Figure 1A).
Sema3C and Sema3D were present in a greater number of
degenerate samples compared to non-degenerate samples
(P = < 0.05) (Figure 1B & 1C). Sema3C was present 78%
of non-degenerate samples, rising significantly to 100%
of infiltrated samples expressing sema3C (P =  0.0443)
(Figure 1B). The proportion of samples expressing sema3D
was significantly higher in the moderately degenerate

blood vessels, NRP1 expression levels decreased
to 89% (Figure 7C). Expression levels between
the cohorts did not show significant differences
due to variation between the surgical and PM, as
shown in red, the PM samples showed much lower
levels of expression in each cohort (Figure 7C).
Immunopositivity of NRP1 and grade of degeneration
were significantly correlated in the surgical cohort
(P = 0.039), yet no significance were seen within the PM
cohort or when the samples were combined (Figure 7F).
NRP2 immunopositivity in the surgical cohort
alone, showed significantly higher expression levels
in the D-/- (P = 0.0008), D+/+ (P = 0.0213) and D+/(P = 0.0213) cohorts compared to the ND-/- cohort.
When surgical and PM samples were combined,
expression levels in the D-/- group were significantly
higher than in the ND-/- (P = 0.0069) group.
Immunopositivity in the D-/- group was significantly
lower than in the D+/- group (P = 0.0437) (Figure 7D).
A strong positive correlation was shown between NRP2
immunopositivity and grade of degeneration in the
surgical cohort alone (P = 0.0203), yet when the data
was combined with the PM samples, correlation was
lost (Figure 7F).
PA1 was expressed in 100% of samples in the
ND-/-, D-/- and D+/+ and 95% D+/- samples (Figure 7E).
Immunopositivity levels were significantly higher in
the D+/- group compared to the ND-/- (P = 0.0161).
PM samples demonstrated much lower levels of PA1
expression as opposed to the painful surgical samples
(Figure 7E). PA1 expression levels show a significant
positive correlation between immunopositivity and grade
of degeneration in the surgical cohort (P = 0.0055), yet due
to the lack of correlation in the PM cohort, significance
was lost when the data was combined (Figure 7F).

induced a significant decrease in PA2 following 100 ng/ml
stimulation (P = 0.0065), but failed to regulate other
plexins (Figure 4C). Plexin expression was not regulated
by cytokines within HDMEC cells (Figure 4D) or SHSY5Y cells (Figure 4E).

Immunodetection of semaphorins and their
receptors within human IVD tissue
Immunopositivity was first identified for NF200 and
CD31 to determine patient samples with the presence of
nerves (NF200+) and blood vessels (CD31+) within NP
tissue (Figure 5A–5B). Semaphorin 3C, sema3D and their
receptors NRP1, NRP2 and PA1 were investigated for
their presence in NP tissue and their association with nerve
and blood vessels (Figure 5C–5G). (Four groups were
investigated: ND-/-: non-degenerate NF200-/CD31-. D-/- :
Degenerate NF200-/CD31-. D+/+: Degenerate NF200+/
CD31+. D+/-: Degenerate NF200+/CD31-), note specific
grade of degeneration within each group was not seperated
for investigation as this would have resulted in 7 groups
and reduced the number of samples within each group.
Co-localisation of CD31 and target molecules was
performed on serial sections and demonstrates a strong colocalisation of CD31 and NRP1, NRP2 and PA1 (Figure 6).
Sema3C and sema3D expression is not directly co-localised
with the blood vessels, yet surrounding cells do express
sema3C and sema3D (Figure 6). Nerve identification on
tissues not stained with NF200 was difficult to localise, and
thus co-localisation was not possible.
Expression levels of sema3C were significantly
higher in the D+/+ group compared to the ND-/- group
(P = 0.0118) (Figure 7A). PM samples demonstrate
lower levels of expression of sema3C compared to
surgically painful samples, particularly in the D-/- cohort
(Figure 7A). A significant positive correlation between
immunopositivity and grade of degeneration was seen
in the PM cohort alone (P = 0.0124) (Supplementary
Figure 1), yet when the data is combined with the surgical
cohort, significance was lost due to variation seen in the
surgical cohort (P = 0.2901).
Sema3D was expressed in 100% of ND-/- samples
and D+/+ samples, decreasing to 93% of patients in the
D-/- cohort (Figure 7B). Sema3D expression levels was
significantly higher in the D-/- compared to D+/- group
(P = 0.0147). Again, as with sema3C, sema3D expression
levels in the PM samples in the D-/- and D+/+ were very
low compared to the surgical painful samples, yet no
significance was seen due to patient variation (Figure 7B).
A significant correlation between sema3D expression and
grade of degeneration was seen within the PM cohort
alone (P = 0.0099) (Figure 7F).

DISCUSSION

Tolofari et al., (2010) described increases in PGP9.5 (a nerve
fibre marker) and CD31 mRNA expression which correlated
with low sema3A mRNA expression in degenerate AF tissue,
thus suggesting that sema3A is a natural inhibitor of nerve
and blood vessel ingrowth in healthy AF [39], however
increased expression was seen in the NP. Not only did we
identify the presence of semaphorins at mRNA level, but
furthered this with the native localisation and expression of
sema3C and sema3D in association with nerve and blood
vessels at protein level in the NP.
Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed strong
positive correlations between sema3C and sema3D
expression with grade of degeneration within the nonpainful PM samples alone, interestingly however,
correlation was lost when combined with the painful
surgical samples due to varied expression. On the contrary,
NRP1, NRP2 and PA1 demonstrated strong positive
correlations with grade of degeneration in the surgically
painful IVD’s alone. This data goes against the original
hypothesis that semaphorins would decrease as the
severity of degeneration occurs. However this being said,
highly degenerate IVD’s may not necessarily be painful
and/or contain nerves and blood vessels [4], which we
have shown to be the case; hence here we investigated
the expression in association with grade and the presence/
absence of nerve and blood vessel ingrowth. Although
all surgical samples used in this study were taken from
patients experiencing pain, it proves difficult to determine
the source of pain; it could be postulated that those tissues
that were histologically graded as ND-/- or D-/- may be
experiencing pain solely from compression or irritation
of the nerve root due to herniation of the IVD. Whereas,
samples that do have nerves and/or blood vessels
present, may have a heightened response to pain due to
the presence of nociceptive nerve fibres. Both sema3C
and sema3D were identified in all NP samples in the
ND-/- cohort, however the percentage immunopositivity
for sema3C and sema3D increased in degenerate tissue
samples with evidence of nerve and blood vessels.
Surgically painful degenerate IVD’s demonstrated a
higher expression of both sema3C and sema3D compared
to non-painful PM tissues; suggesting a possible attractive
role rather than repulsion. Similarly, levels of NRP1
and PA1 from surgically painful degenerate IVD’s
were higher than those of non-painful PM tissue. NRP2
immunopositivity levels were more varied between nonpainful PM samples. The higher immunopositivity levels
in painful surgical samples indicate a more prominent
role for semaphorins in painful surgical samples. It must
be taken into account that the preparation of the surgical
and PM samples were different, and the PM samples
processed at Utrecht may have been subject to antigen
destruction during decalcification which could explain
the overall decreased levels of immunopositivity in
these samples. Sema3C and sema3D immunopositivity

It is postulated that the ingrowth of nociceptive
nerves and blood vessels into the degenerate IVD may
be involved in the generation of chronic back pain [19,
28], yet the mechanisms involved in innervation and
vascularisation of the IVD remain largely unknown.
Recent studies have focused heavily on the presence
of neurotrophic and angiogenic factors, in the hope of
identifying a key player involved in the ingrowth into
diseased discs [24, 25, 29, 43–46]. However only one
paper to date has investigated the role of semaphorins
which are thought to be inhibitory by nature to nerve and
blood vessel ingrowth within the degenerate IVD [39].
Here, all class 3 semaphorins and their receptors at mRNA
level were investigated, together with their regulation by
cytokines known to be up regulated within the degenerate
IVD. Further to this, sema3C, sema3D and their receptors
were investigated for their protein expression within IVD
tissues in association with nerve and blood vessels.
Members of the class 3 semaphorins are primarily
known for their role in axonal pathfinding during
development [47, 48], as well as having implications in
angiogenesis and the immune system [49–51] amongst
others [50].
Here, sema3A, sema3C, sema3D, sema3E, sema3F
and their receptors the NRPs and PA1-A4 were identified
at mRNA level in native NP cells. Although no significant
changes in expression levels between the degenerate
cohorts were identified, it is interesting that the majority
of samples, particularly in the diseased state expressed
these molecules. In contrast to the previous study, sema3A
expression was evident in 100% of IVD tissues regardless
of grade of degeneration, whereas Tolofari et al., (2010)
showed sema3A expression in 57% of healthy NP and
33% degenerate NP samples [39]. In addition to this,
NRP1 was expressed by 89% of our severely degenerate
DE NP samples; yet Tolofari et al., (2010) did not see any
expression of NRP1 in the healthy NP cohort but 60%
of degenerate NP samples expressed NRP1. NRP2 was
constitutively expressed by NP cells regardless of disease
state in our study, however low levels were seen in both
healthy and degenerate NP in the previous study. Plexin
expression was evident in all disease states, yet Tolofari et
al., (2010) did not identify PA1 in any sample, and only
found PA2 in degenerate NP samples. The discrepancies
in expression between the two studies could be due to
the sensitivity of quantitative real-time PCR used here
on more patient samples as opposed to standard real time
PCR used in the previous study on 7 NP samples.
As the semaphorins are heavily involved in the
repulsion of nerves and blood vessels in other systems and
particularly during development, it was postulated that the
expression of semaphorins would decrease in degenerate
IVD’s where innervation and angiogenesis is evident.

demonstrated strong correlations with their receptors.
This data indicates that sema3C and sema3D may have an
active role in degeneration as there is a corresponding up
regulation in their receptors. Sema3C has been described
as a bi- functional semaphorin as it can also attract cells
such as mouse glomerular endothelial cells, in a similar
fashion to that seen by VEGF [52]. In this study, all
samples where nerves and blood vessels were absent were
positive for sema3C. Initially, this suggests that sema3C
may have a protective role against nerve and blood vessel
ingrowth. However, in the degenerate cohorts with evident
nerve and blood vessel ingrowth, immunopositivity levels
were significantly higher compared to negative/negative
samples, indicating that sema3C may have a bi-functional
role within the IVD to promote ingrowth of blood vessels
and nerve fibres.
Although sema3D has not been characterised
as well as other members of the class 3 semaphorins,
it too has been shown to possess chemorepellent and
chemoattractant properties towards neurons within the
CNS of zebrafish depending on the composition of the
NRP molecule [53]. Immunopositivity of sema3D was
seen in very high proportions of IVD samples regardless
of whether nerves and blood vessels were present.
However levels of sema3D expression in the degenerate
cohort with nerves but no blood vessels, was lower than
in the degenerate negative/negative cohort indicating that
sema3D may be involved in the chemoattraction of nerves
but not blood vessels.
Sema3C and sema3D both bind to NRP1 and NRP2
with equal affinity, immunopositivity levels of NRP1 and
NRP2 were higher in the degenerate negative/negative
samples compared to the non-degenerate negative/
negative samples suggesting a possible role for the NRPs
in degeneration. NRP’s are a co-receptor for VEGF as well
as semaphorins, and VEGF is known to be up regulated
by cytokines within human NP cells within the degenerate
disc [29]. This study demonstrated a strong co-localisation
with endothelial cells and NRP1, NRP2 and PA1 which
are known co-receptors for VEGFR binding.
Regulatory studies performed here demonstrate for
the first time that class 3 semaphorins and their receptors
are susceptible to regulation by inflammatory cytokines
particularly IL-1β, in human NP cells. Cytokines are
well known for their role in human IVD degeneration,
and they have recently been shown to regulate the
expression of neurotrophic factors, particularly NGF and
BDNF in human NP cells [22, 26, 29]. This suggests
a function for these molecules in the promotion and
survival of nerve and blood vessel ingrowth into the
degenerate IVD. However, as indicated above there may
be a role for the semaphorins in the advocacy of nerve
and blood vessel ingrowth as their expression from
human NP cells in degenerate tissue with/without nerves
and blood vessels differs to non-degenerate negative/
negative samples.

Interestingly, sema3C and sema3D were more
responsive to cytokine stimulation than other more
characterised semaphorins, showing significant up
regulations in response to as little as 10 pg/mL IL-1β
stimulation. Semaphorins were not regulated by IL-6
or TNFα in human NP cells, thus suggesting a key
role for IL-1β in this process. Likewise, regulation of
semaphorin receptors was more prominent in response
to IL-1β stimulation than IL-6 or TNFα. Stimulation
with IL-1β induced NRP2 and plexin expression. A
previous study relating to human proximal tubular cells
demonstrated similar trends after IL-1β stimulation in
that NRP1 decreased, and NRP2 increased [54]. From
the data presented here, it could be hypothesised that
cytokines within the degenerate NP, stimulate the up
regulation of sema3C and sema3D and, as previously
shown NGF and VEGF [29] which are factors known
to promote the survival and proliferation of nerve and
blood vessels. Additionally IL-1β increased sema3C
expression in endothelial cells which could intensify the
chemoattraction of nerves along with the expression of
NGF which we already know endothelial cells present
in the human NP express [19]. We have shown that a
nerve cell line (SHSY5Y) expresses NRP1, NRP2 and
PA1-A4, however; although there is an up regulation of
semaphorins from NP cells upon cytokine stimulation,
the receptors are not regulated by cytokines in a nerve
cell line or endothelial cells suggesting that nerve
and blood vessels within the diseased IVD may not
respond to cytokines from NP cells. The responses of
NP, nerve and blood vessels to semaphorins need to
be further investigated to identify if the receptors are
active and able to exert the effects of semaphorins in the
environment of the disc.
The interplay between biological and mechanical
influences within the degenerative process has recently
become a focus point within research, with many groups
investigating the link between mechanical affects and
biological outcomes. It is widely thought that multiple
factors are involved in the generation of LBP, recent
studies have highlighted a potential relationship between
modic changes [55, 56] and low grade bacterial infection
[57] in the production of pain, as both compromise the
structural integrity of the vertebral body.
A possible initiating factor of IVD degeneration is the
disruption of the vertebral end plate; this is known to result in
increased catabolic enzyme production which degrade matrix
molecules such as aggrecan. The loss of such proteoglycans
is primarily known for its effect on disc hydration, yet the
loss of disc height and pressure alterations within the NP can
lead to extensive fissuring seen in degenerate IVD’s [58].
Stefanakis et al., (2012) reported strong localisation of nerve
and blood vessels to annular fissures due to its conducive
environment to nerves and blood vessels [58]; hence
providing a likely route into the deeper layers of the IVD.
Data presented here show that nerves and blood vessels were

for 30 minutes at 37°C, and washed twice with DMEM.
Following this, NP cells were isolated using 2 mg/mL
collagenase type 1 (Sigma, UK) for 4 hours at 37°C. Cells
were passed through a 40 μM cell strainer (Invitrogen, UK)
as previously published [41]. Following extraction cells
were either used for direct RNA extraction or cell culture.
RNA and cDNA was synthesised as previously published
[42] [42]. Target genes were investigated using QRT-PCR.
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(QRT-PCR) was conducted on 9 non-degenerate samples
(grade < 4) from 9 patients, 15 moderately degenerate
samples (grade grade 4 -7) from 15 patients, and 28
severely degenerate samples (grade > 7) from 28 patients,
and 20 samples with evident infiltration from patients
experiencing pain (Supplementary Table 1).
QRT-PCR was performed on a StepOnePlus™ RealTime PCR System (Applied Biosystems, UK) in order to
investigate gene expression levels of Semaphorin3A-F and
their receptors, NRP1 and NRP2, along with PlexinA1-A4
(PA1-PA4)(Pre-designed primer/probe mixes Applied
Biosystems, UK) within directly extracted samples from
degenerate and non-degenerate samples. Glyceraldehyde3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and 18S (Applied
Biosystems, UK) were used as housekeeping genes to allow
normalisation. Ten microliter reactions were prepared using
TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems,
UK). Results were analysed using the 2−ΔCt method and
presented as relative gene expression normalised to the
average CT for the two housekeeping genes.

present both next to and distant from fissures, yet it has to be
taken into account that this study is based on 10 μm sections
from herniated tissues, and PM samples. Ideally whole
human IVDs would have been serially sectioned and stained
to form a 3D model highlighting the pathway and localisation
of nerve and blood vessels within the IVD. Recent studies by
Gawri et al., (2014) demonstrated an increased production
of inflammatory factors such as NGF, TNFα and IL-6 from
IVD cells under high mechanical strain [43]; thus suggesting
that abnormal strain on the human IVD could potentiate
or drive the inflammatory process that occurs during
degeneration which may advocate the ingrowth of nerves
and blood vessels. Results presented here, demonstrate an
increased production of semaphorins and their receptors (also
known to be involved in angiogenesis) in response to such
inflammatory factors. This taken alongside recent studies
focussing on mechanical cues could implicate a multifactorial
process which ultimately accelerates disc degeneration.

MATERIALS and METHODS
Human tissue
Human IVD tissue was obtained from surgery or
post mortem examination (processed within 72 hours after
death) with informed consent of the patient or relatives.
Ethical approval was obtained from Sheffield Research
Ethics Committee (09/H1308/70) for 89 surgical IVD
samples from 89 individuals, and 4 post mortem (PM)
samples from 2 individuals, and 18 PM samples from the
department of Pathology/UMCU Biobank, UMC Utrecht,
used in line with the code of proper secondary use of
human tissue (Supplementary Table 1).

their receptors in human NP cells, SH-SY5Y cells
and HDMEC cells

Tissue processing

NP cell culture

Tissue processed at Sheffield Hallam University
consisting of AF and NP was fixed in 10% neutral buffered
formalin, and processed to paraffin wax. Tissue processed at
Utrecht was obtained 24 hours after death and IVD slices were
decalcified in Kristensen’s solution (50% formic acid, and
68 g/l sodium formate) in a microwave at 150 W and 50°C for
6 hours as previously published [40]. Sections were dehydrated
and rinsed in xylene before being embedded to paraffin wax.
Following embedding, 4 μm sections cut and histologically
graded using previously published criteria [12, 29].

Following extraction NP cells were cultured for
expansion in monolayer in DMEM supplemented with
10% v/v heat inactivated foetal calf serum (FCS), 100
U/ml Penicillin, 100 μg/ml Streptomycin, 250 ng/ml
amphotericin, 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen, UK) and 50 μg/
ml ascorbic acid (Sigma Aldrich, UK) (Complete cell culture
media) and maintained at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2. Complete culture media was changed
every 3 days. Following expansion in monolayer up to
passage 2, NP cells were resuspended in 1.2% medium
viscosity sodium alginate (Sigma Aldrich, UK) at 4 × 106
cells/ml and alginate beads as previously published [12]. All
NP cells used in this experiment were cultured in alginate
for 2 weeks prior to cytokine treatments to enable cells to
regain native cellular phenotypes [12].

Investigation of class 3 semaphorins and their
receptors within native NP cells
Samples from degenerate IVD tissue were obtained
from 69 patients undergoing microdiscectomy for the
treatment of low back pain which mainly consisted of NP
tissue, and 2 PM samples from 1 patient were used. NP
tissue was separated from contaminating AF and CEP and
digested with 2 U/ml protease (Sigma, UK) in DMEM

cells/well. Human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMECs) were seeded into 6 well plates at a density
of 1 × 106 cells/well in complete HDMEC growth factor
media (PromoCell, UK).

Following 2 weeks culture in alginate beads, NP
cells were treated with pro-inflammatory cytokines: IL1β, IL-6 and TNFα (Peprotech, UK) for 48 hours. NP cells
were treated with IL-6 and TNFα at 0, 1, 10 and100 ng/mL
in serum free media in triplicate on 3 independent patients.
IL-1β treatments were performed on 5 patients in triplicate
(0, 1, 10, 100 ng/mL) and on 3 patients in triplicate at
a wider concentration range (0, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10
and 100 ng/mL) for 48 hours to identify dose responses.
SH-SY5Y and HDMEC cells were allowed to adhere for
24 hours prior to stimulation with 10 ng/mL IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-8 or TNFα for 48 hours.
Following cytokine treatments, alginate beads were
washed in 0.15 M NaCl and dissolved by application
of alginate dissolving buffer (55 mM sodium citrate
(Na3C6H5O7), 30 mM Na EDTA and 0.15 M NaCl at pH6.8)
for 15 minutes at 37°C followed by digestion of extracellular
matrix in 0.06% w/v collagenase type 1 (Sigma, UK) for
30 minutes. RNA was extracted and cDNA synthesised
and QRT-PCR used to investigate expression levels of
semaphorins and their receptors as described above.

Briefly, four micron sections were dewaxed,
rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase blocked. Antigen
retrieval methods were performed (Supplementary Table 2).
Following TBS washes, nonspecific binding sites were
blocked at room temperature for 2 hours with either 25% w/v
goat or rabbit serum (Abcam, UK) in 1% w/v bovine serum
albumin (Sigma, UK) in TBS (Supplementary Table 2).
Sections were incubated overnight at 4°C with either mouse
or rabbit polyclonal antibodies (Supplementary Table 2).
Negative controls in which rabbit and mouse IgGs (Abcam,
UK) replaced the primary antibody at an equal protein
concentration were used. Slides were washed in TBS and a
1:500 dilution of 1% w/v BSA/TBS biotinylated secondary
antibody was applied for 30 minutes at room temperature
(Supplementary Table 2). Binding of the secondary
antibody was disclosed with streptavidin-biotin complex
(Vector Laboratories, UK) technique with 0.08% v/v
hydrogen peroxide in 0.65 mg/mL 3, 3′-diaminobenzidine
tetrahydrochloride (Sigma, UK) in TBS. Sections were
counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin (Leica, UK),
dehydrated, cleared and mounted with Pertex (Leica, UK).
All slides were visualised using an Olympus
BX60 microscope and images captured using a digital
camera and software program QCapture Pro v8.0
(MediaCybernetics, UK). Evaluation of IHC staining
was performed by counting a minimum of 200 NP cells
as immunopositive or immunonegative; immunopositive
cells were expressed as a percentage of total count.

Immunohistochemistry

Statistical analysis

Initial investigations to identify NF200
(neurofilament 200, nerve marker) and CD31 (blood
vessel marker) immunopositivity was performed in order
to further investigate the relationship between the presence
of nerve and blood vessels and the expression of factors
involved in their survival in human NP tissue.
Tissues samples were selected which contained
NP and AF tissue and were grouped into the following
categories based on the identification of nerves (NF200+)
and blood vessels (CD31+) in tissues which had been
histologically graded. Non-degenerate tissues (grade < 4)
NF200-/CD31- (ND-/-)(n = 5), Degenerate tissues
(grade  > 4) NF200-/CD31- (D-/-)(n = 14), Degenerate
(grade > 4) NF200+/CD31+ (D+/+)(n = 14) and
Degenerate (grade > 4) NF200+/CD31- (D+/-) (n = 19).
No disc samples were identified which displayed NF200-/
CD31+ profile and hence this group was not investigated.
Post mortem tissue was utilised to enable localisation of
nerves and blood vessels within the different regions.
Studies were conducted on the above cohorts to
investigate the expression of class 3 semaphorins, Sema3C
and Sema3D and their receptors NRP1, NRP2 and PA1
and their association with tissues with nerves and blood
vessels using immunohistochemistry as per Le Maitre
et al., (2004) [13].

Data was shown to be non-parametric and hence a
Kruskall-Wallis with Conover-Inman post hoc analysis
test was used to identify significant differences between
cytokine treatments on human NP cells as well as differences
between patient cohorts investigated by IHC (P ≤ 0.05). Two
independent proportionality tests were performed to identify
differences between the proportions of samples expressing
the target molecules in the DE sample cohorts (P ≤ 0.05).
Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the
correlation between target molecules used in IHC (P ≤ 0.05).

CONCLUSION
Previous research into painful intervertebral discs
found associations with nerve and blood vessels and
painful discs, with suggestions that blood vessels enter the
IVD first, expressing NGF which promotes the in growth
of nerves [19, 28]. Yet research presented here, suggests
that nerves are able to innervate the NP without endothelial
cell protrusion first; further research on a larger cohort
of samples should be performed to confirm this finding.
The current study suggests that members of the class 3
semaphorins may be implicated in the ingrowth of nerves
and blood vessels in the degenerate NP of surgically painful
18351

IVDs, in particular sema3C and sema3D which according
to previous research in other systems are thought to have
potential chemoattractive functions. Further research is
required to confirm the function of these molecules on
nerves and blood vessels in conjunction with human NP
cells, in a degenerate environment. To conclude, this study
implicates a role for sema3C and sema3D in the innervation
and vascularisation of the human IVD during degeneration,
which is postulated to be a cause of chronic low back pain.
