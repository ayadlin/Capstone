BACKGROUND: It has been demonstrated that NK012, a novel 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38)-incorporating polymeric micelle, exerts significantly more potent antitumor activity against various human tumor xenografts
than irinotecan (CPT-11) (a water-soluble prodrug of SN-38). Combination therapy of anticancer agents with bevacizumab (Bv), an anti-vascualr endothelial growth factor humanized monoclonal antibody, has more potently inhibited
tumor growth than either agent alone. In the current study, the authors examined the antitumor effect of NK012 in
combination with Bv against human lung cancer. METHODS: Nude mice bearing lung adenocarcinoma (PC-14 or
A549 xenografts) were administered NK012 at SN-38-equivalent doses of 5 mg/kg or 30 mg/kg in combination with
or without Bv at 5 mg/kg. CPT-11 at a dose of 66.7 mg/kg was administered with or without Bv at a dose of 5 mg/kg
in the same experimental model. To evaluate interaction with Bv, the pharmacokinetics and microvessel density in
tumors that were treated on each regimen were analyzed. RESULT: In vitro, the growth-inhibitory effect of NK012
was 50-fold more potent than that of CPT-11 and was almost equivalent to that of SN-38. In vivo studies revealed
that the combination of NK012 plus Bv had significantly greater antitumor activity against human lung cancer xenografts compared with NK012 alone (PC-14, P ¼.0261; A549, P < .001). The pharmacokinetic profile of NK012 revealed
that coadministration of Bv did not interfere with the accumulation of NK012. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, significant antitumor activity was noted with NK012 in combination with Bv against lung cancer cells. The current results

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including adenocarcinoma, accounts for 75% to 80% of lung cancer cases.1 Currently, cisplatin (CDDP)-based chemotherapy
is the recommended first-line treatment for patients with advanced NSCLC.2,3 Despite recent advances in the treatment
of lung cancer, the prognosis for patients with NSCLC remains relatively poor, so attention currently is focused on finding
novel agents, including new cytotoxic agents.
Irinotecan (CPT-11), a prodrug of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38) (the active metabolite of irinotecan),
which is a topoisomerase-I inhibitor, appears to be an effective agent against NSCLC when used as monotherapy or in
combination with cisplatin.4,5 Bevacizumab (Bv) is an antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) humanized
monoclonal antibody. Bv reportedly is effective in various cancers, including colorectal cancer,6 renal cell cancer,7 and
breast cancer.8 Sandler et al reported that the addition of Bv to paclitaxel plus carboplatin in the treatment of NSCLC had
a significant survival benefit.9 In addition, Reck et al reported that the addition of Bv to gemcitabine plus cisplatin also
had a significant clinical benefit in NSCLC.10

Original Article

NK012 is an SN-38-incorporating polymeric
micelle and is categorized as a drug-delivery system. We
previously demonstrated that NK012 accumulates more
efficiently in various human tumor xenografts by using
leaky tumor vessels and exerts significantly more potent
antitumor activity against various human tumor xenografts compared with CPT-11.11-17 Since the greater antitumor effect of NK012 may be attributed to its greater
accumulation in the tumor using the leaky tumor vasculature, the addition of Bv to NK012 may hinder the efficient accumulation of NK012 in tumors because the
permeability of tumor vasculature caused by VEGF is
inhibited by Bv. In the current study, we evaluated the
antitumor activity of NK012 administered in combination with Bv in experimental models.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. The absorbance of the
formazan product formed was detected at 450 nm in a 96well spectrophotometric plate reader. Cell viability was
measured and compared with that of the control cells.
Each experiment was carried out in triplicate. Data were
averaged and normalized against the nontreated controls
to generate dose-response curves.
In Vivo Growth-Inhibition Assay
The animal experimental protocols were approved by the
Committee for Ethics of Animal Experimentation, and
the experiments were conducted in accordance with the
Guidelines for Animal Experiments from the National
Cancer Center.
Female BALB/c mice, 6 weeks old, were obtained
from SLC Japan (Shizuoka, Japan). These mice were
maintained in a laminar air-flow cabinet and were inoculated subcutaneously with 5  106 PC-14 cells or with
5  106 A549 cells in the flank region. When tumor volumes (TVs) reached approximately 100 mm3, the mice
were divided randomly into test groups of 5 mice per
group (Day 0). The length (a) and width (b) of the tumor mass were measured twice weekly, and the TV was
calculated as follows: TV ¼ (a  b2)/2. The relative TV
(RTV) at Day n was calculated as follows: RTV ¼ TVn/
TV0, where TVn is the TV at Day n, and TV0 is the TV
at Day 0.

Drugs and Cells
NK012, an SN-38-incorporating polymeric micelle, and
SN-38 were obtained from Nippon Kayaku Company,
Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), CPT-11 was purchased from Yakult
Honsha Company, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan), and Bv was purchased from Chugai Seiyaku Company, Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines PC-14
and PC-9 kindly were provided by Dr. Y. Hayata (Tokyo
Medical University, Tokyo, Japan). Human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines A549, NCI-H23, and NCI-H1975
were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, Va). These cell lines were maintained in
RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Cell Culture Technologies, Gaggenau-Hoerden,
Germany), penicillin (100 U/mL), streptomycin (100 lg/
mL), and amphotericin B (25 lg/mL; all from Sigma, St.
Louis, Mo) in a humidified, 5% CO2 atmosphere at
37 C.

Experiment 1: Evaluation of the Antitumor
Effect of NK012 and CPT-11
By comparing the data between NK012 and CPT-11, we
evaluated their effects as single agents against PC-14 or
A549 xenografts. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
of NK012 (30 mg/kg)11 or the MTD of CPT-11 (66.7
mg/kg)18 was administered by intravenous injection into
the tail vein on Days 0, 4, and 8.

In Vitro Growth-Inhibition Assay
PC-14, A549, NCI-H23, and NCI-H1975 cells were
seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 10,000 cells per
well in a final volume of 100 lL. Twenty-four hours after
seeding, the medium was removed, and a graded concentration of SN38, NK012, and CPT-11 was added to the
wells. Cultures were maintained in a CO2 incubator for
an additional 72 hours. Then, cell growth inhibition was
measured by using a tetrazolium salt-based proliferation
assay (WST assay; Wako Chemicals, Osaka, Japan). After
removal of the medium, WST-8 solution (10 lL) and medium (90 lL) were added to the wells, and the plates were

Experiment 2: Evaluation of the Antitumor
Effect of NK012 Alone and NK012 With Bv
By comparing the data between NK012 alone and
NK012 plus Bv, we evaluated the combined effect of
NK012 plus Bv against PC-14 xenografts. NK012 at a
dose of 5 mg/kg was administered intravenously into the
tail vein on Days 0, 4, and 8 with or without Bv. In addition, we evaluated the combined effects against A549 xenografts (NK012 [30 mg/kg intravenously] with Bv).
When Bv was coadministered with each anticancer agent,
Bv was administered intraperitoneally at a dose of 5 mg/
kg on Days 0, 4, and 8.

Distribution Studies of Free SN-38, CPT-11,
and NK012 in Tumors by High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography
When the PC-14 TV reached approximately 100 mm3,
NK012 (30 mg/kg) or CPT-11 (66.7 mg/kg) was administered intravenously with or without Bv (5 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Twenty-four hours after the injection of
NK012 or CPT-11, each tumor was excised under anesthesia. In other experiments, NK012 (5 mg/kg) was
administered intravenously with or without Bv (5 mg/kg
intraperitoneally), and each tumor was excised under anesthesia at 12 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, 7 days, 10 days, and
14 days after the injection of NK012. The tumor tissues
were rinsed with physiologic saline; mixed with 0.1 M glycine-HCl buffer, pH 3.0, in methanol at 5% (weight/
weight); and homogenized. To detect free SN-38 and
CPT-11, the tumor samples (100 lL) were mixed with
20 lL 1 mM phosphoric acid in methanol (1:1) and
40 lL ultrapure water, and camptothecin was used as the
internal standard (10 ng/mL for free SN-38, 12 ng/mL
for CPT-11). The samples were vortexed vigorously for
10 seconds and filtered through an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter device (Millipore, Bedford, Mass). Reversephase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
was conducted at 35 C on a Mightysil RP-18 GP column
(150  4.6 mm; Kanto Chemical, Tokyo, Japan). Then,
the samples were injected into an Alliance Water 2795
HPLC system (Waters, Milford, Mass) equipped with a
Waters 2475 multi-k fluorescence detector. Fluorescence
originating from SN-38 was detected at 540 nm with an
excitation wavelength of 365 nm.
For the detection of polymer-bound SN-38, SN-38
was released from the polymer as described previously.11
In brief, 100-lL tissue samples were diluted with 20 lL
methanol (50% [weight/weight]) and 20 lL NaOH

(0.7 M). The samples were incubated for 15 minutes at
room temperature. After incubation, 20 lL HCl (0.7 M)
and 60 lL of internal standard solution were added to the
samples and the hydrolysate was filtered. The filtrate was
applied to the HPLC system. Polymer-bound SN-38 was
determined by subtraction of nonpolymer-bound SN-38
from the total SN-38 in the hydrolysate.
Immunofluorescence Study
At Day 14 after the injection of saline, Bv, NK012, or
NK012 plus Bv, the PC-14 tumors were excised under anesthesia. Frozen sections of these tumors (10 lm) were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After blocking with 5% skim
milk (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) in PBS, the slides were
incubated with anti-cluster of differentiation molecule 31
(anti-CD31) monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution; PharMingen, San Diego, Calif) and anti-NG2 monoclonal
antibody (1:1000 dilution; Chemicon, Temecula, Calif)
for 1 hour. After washing with PBS, the slides were stained
with Alexa 555-, Alexa 647-conjugated secondary antibodies, antirat (red) and antirabbit immunoglobulin G
(green; 1:100 dilution; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif), and
40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) for nuclear staining. Five areas were chosen randomly from each mouse
(n ¼ 2), and the fluorescence intensity was measured and
analyzed with BZ-II ANALYZER software (Keyence,
Osaka, Japan) for histologic quantification under fluorescence microscopy at 20-fold magnification.

Histologic Examination of PC-14 and A549
Xenografts
Hematoxylin and eosin staining of the tumors from
PC-14 xenografts revealed that the tumors were poor in
stroma, whereas the tumors from A549 xenografts
appeared to be stroma-rich. Immunostaining of both tumor tissues with CD31 and NG2 indicated that vasculatures covered with pericytes were more abundant in the
A549 xenografts than in the PC-14 xenografts (Fig. 1).
Antitumor Activity of NK012 and CPT-11 on
Subcutaneous PC-14 and A549 Xenografts
Experiment 1: Comparison of the antitumor effect
of NK012 and CPT-11

In PC-14 xenografts that were treated with NK012
at 30 mg/kg, the tumors started to shrink on Day 4, the
tumors disappeared completely by Day 14, and there was
no relapse during observation until 60 days after treatment (Fig. 2A). Comparison of the relative TV revealed
that the antitumor activity of NK012 was significantly
greater than that of CPT-11 (P ¼ .0267). Conversely, the
TV did not shrink in A549 tumor-bearing mice that were
treated with NK012 (Fig. 2B). Although the antitumor
activity of NK012 did not differ significantly from that of
CPT-11 in A549 xenografts (P ¼ .0869), a trend toward a
superior antitumor effect against A549 tumors was
observed in the NK012 treatment group.
Experiment 2: Comparison of the antitumor effect
of NK012 alone and NK012 plus Bv

In PC-14 xenografts, the combination of 5 mg/kg
NK012 with 5 mg/kg Bv resulted in a significantly
greater inhibition of tumor growth compared with
NK012 5 mg/kg alone (P ¼ .0261) (Fig. 3A). Also in
A549 xenografts, the combination of 30 mg/kg NK012
with 5 mg/kg Bv resulted in significant inhibition
of tumor growth compared with NK012 30 mg/kg alone
(P < .0001) (Fig. 3B).
Distribution Studies of Free SN-38, CPT-11,
and NK012 in Tumors Using HPLC
In tumors that were obtained 24 hours after the injection
of CPT-11 or NK012, the level of free SN-38 released
from NK012 was significantly greater than the level of
SN-38 converted from CPT-11 (P ¼ .003) (Fig. 4A).
Conversely, the level of free SN-38 released from treatment with NK012 plus Bv did not differ significantly
from the level released from treatment with NK012 alone.

between treatment with NK012 alone and treatment with
NK012 plus Bv. Thereafter, the intratumor concentrations of both polymer-bound SN-38 and free SN-38 did
not differ between treatment with NK012 alone and treatment with NK012 plus Bv (Fig. 4C,D).
Immunofluorescence Staining to Clarify the
Antivascular Effect of Bv
Treatment with Bv in combination with or without
NK012 significantly reduced the area of CD31-positive
proliferating endothelial cells in the tumors compared
with controls on Day 14 (P < .01) (Fig. 5A,B). Conversely, the area of NG2-positive pericytes was not significantly different between the groups (Fig. 5A,C).

DISCUSSION
The size of NK012 is approximately 20 nm in diameter,
and NK012 is sufficiently large to avoid renal secretion.
NK012 can evade nonspecific capture by the reticuloendothelial system in various organs, because the outer shell
of NK012 is covered with polyethyleneglycol. Therefore,
NK012 is expected to achieve a long plasma half-life,
which permits large amounts of SN-38 to reach the tumor
site through the enhanced permeability and retention
effect.19

4602

To date, we have reported that NK012 has significantly greater antitumor activity against various human
tumor xenografts including, small cell lung cancer,11,17
colorectal cancer,14 renal cancer,13 pancreatic cancer,12
gastric cancer,15 and malignant glioma,16 compared with
CPT-11. In the current study, NK012 also appeared to
eradicate PC-14 xenografts completely, but not A549 xenografts. This difference may be because of differences in
the sensitivity of each cell line to NK012 and in pericyte
coverage on vasculatures. Less pericyte coverage reportedly
to results in more leakiness of plasma substances; therefore, the degree of NK012 accumulation may be associated inversely with the degree of pericyte coverage.20,21
Angiogenesis, which permits tumors to grow and
metastasize, plays a pivotal role in several pathologic disorders.22 VEGF is 1 of the most potent positive regulators of
angiogenesis23 and is recognized as an attractive target in
cancer therapy. Unlike normal vasculature, the microvessels
of tumors are hyperpermeable to several substances, including macromolecules and nanoparticles. The permeability,
interstitial fluid pressure, and numbers of microvessels are
increased by VEGF-induced angiogenesis.24,25 Anti-VEGF
antibody administered in combination with chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin,26 topotecan,27,28
paclitaxel,29 and docetaxel,30 resulted in more potent inhibition of tumor growth than either agent alone. However,
it has not been clarified whether anti-VEGF antibody

Cancer

administered in combination with drug-incorporating
polymeric micelles has an additive effect. In the current
study, we demonstrated that the combination of NK012
plus Bv had significantly greater antitumor activity against
human lung adenocarcinoma cells (PC-14 and A549) compared with NK012 alone. The concentrations of either
polymer-bound SN-38 or free SN-38 after the administration of NK012 plus Bv did not clearly differ from the concentrations after NK012 alone. In addition, after treatment
with Bv, the area of vascular endothelial cells stained with
CD31 was decreased significantly compared with controls.
These results suggest that VEGF inhibition may not disturb NK012 accumulation in the tumors and that the
direct effect of NK012 plus Bv produced an additional
antitumor effect.
In the current study, we demonstrated that NK012
has significantly greater antitumor activity against human
lung adenocarcinoma cells (PC-14 and A549) compared
with CPT-11. Therefore, we believe that NK012 is a
promising oncologic treatment for patients with NSCLC.
In 2 individual phase 1 trials that were conducted in Japan
and the United States, the toxic profile of NK012 was
favorable, and the dose-limiting toxicity was neutropenia.31,32 Diarrhea was mild; that is, even the worst diarrhea was grade 2 in the phase 1 setting.
In conclusion, the current study demonstrated the
superior antitumor activity of NK012 against NSCLC
cells compared with CPT-11. In patients with NSCLC,
clinical trials of the combination of NK012 plus Bv may
be warranted.
