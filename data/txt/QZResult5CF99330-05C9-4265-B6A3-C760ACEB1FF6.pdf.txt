ABSTRACT
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignancy of the antibody-producing plasma cells.
MM is a highly heterogeneous disease, which has hampered the identification of a
common underlying mechanism for disease establishment as well as the development
of targeted therapy. Here we present the first genome-wide profiling of histone H3
lysine 27 and lysine 4 trimethylation in MM patient samples, defining a common set of
active H3K4me3-enriched genes and silent genes marked by H3K27me3 (H3K27me3
alone or bivalent) unique to primary MM cells, when compared to normal bone marrow
plasma cells. Using this epigenome profile, we found increased silencing of H3K27me3
targets in MM patients at advanced stages of the disease, and the expression pattern of
H3K27me3-marked genes correlated with poor patient survival. We also demonstrated
that pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 had anti-myeloma effects in both MM cell
lines and CD138+ MM patient cells. In addition, EZH2 inhibition decreased the global
H3K27 methylation and induced apoptosis. Taken together, these data suggest an
important role for the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) in MM, and highlights
the PRC2 component EZH2 as a potential therapeutic target in MM.

associated with monoclonal protein in the blood and/
or urine [1, 2]. The myeloma cell resembles a postgerminal center, isotype-switched, long-living plasma
cell with retained proliferation potential [3]. According
to the current view, MM is a genetically complex and

heterogeneous disease characterized by the accumulation
of several genetic lesions, such as numeric and structural
chromosomal aberrations, and gene mutations in different
pathways [2]. Recent sequencing projects indicate the
absence of common underlying genetic events as drivers
of MM pathogenesis and underline the large intra- and
interpatient heterogeneity that may limit the clinical
benefits of targeted therapy [4–8].
In addition to genetic abnormalities, recent studies
have shown that deregulation of epigenetic mechanisms
could play an essential role in MM development [9].
The t(4;14) translocation affects 15% of patients and
is considered a marker of poor prognosis in MM [10].
The t(4;14) translocation highlights the importance
of epigenetic modulators in MM, as the multiple
myeloma SET domain (MMSET) is known to establish
dimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me2)
[11]. Recently, the overexpression of MMSET in MM has
been shown to alter the global chromatin landscape i.e.
increased H3K36me2 and redistribution of H3K27me3
[12, 13]. Additionally, in a proportion of primary MM and
MM cell lines lacking t(4;14) a recurrent mutation in the
H3K27 demethylase KDM6A (also known as UTX) has
been reported [14], further highlighting an emerging role
of chromatin modifiers in MM. In these cases, however,
epigenetic deregulation has so far only been observed in a
subpopulation of patients. When focusing on the common
underexpressed genes in MM plasma cells as compared
with the normal counterpart we have previously identified
a set of genes targeted by the Polycomb repressive
complex 2 (PRC2) [15]. PRC2 is a transcriptional
repressor with an important role during development
and differentiation [16]. Its catalytic subunits, enhancer
of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) or the related EZH1,
trimethylate lysine 27 on histone H3 which is associated
with gene silencing and monoubiquitination of histone
H2A [17] and/or DNA-methylation [18, 19]. Pathologic
activation of EZH2 by genetic alterations has been
documented in various cancers, including hematological
tumors, making EZH2 a potential therapeutic target [20,
21]. In MM, EZH2 has previously been suggested to have
oncogenic properties based on its overexpression and
correlation of histone methyltransferase activity to tumor
formation in vivo [22].
In this study, the aim was to investigate the genomewide distribution of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 in MM
and to test whether pharmacological inhibition of the
methyltransferase activity of EZH2 would demonstrate
anti-myeloma potential. Using ChIP-sequencing, we
define MM-unique Polycomb (H3K27me3 alone and
bivalent) target genes when compared with targets of this
complex defined in normal bone marrow plasma cells. We
show that the MM-unique H3K27me3-enriched genes
significantly overlap with underexpressed genes in MM
patients in ISS stage III, as compared with stage I and II,
and in patients with poor survival in independent clinical

MM studies. We further illustrate that two selective small
chemical EZH2 inhibitors, UNC1999 and GSK343,
reduced the survival of MM cell lines and primary cells.
EZH2 inhibition decreased H3K27 methylation marks,
induced apoptosis and inhibited colony formation in MM
cell lines. These data strengthen our previous hypothesis
on Polycomb involvement in MM and highlight EZH2 as
a promising therapeutic target in MM.

RESULTS
Chromatin profiles and transcriptional states in
MM patient samples
Using an integrative genomic approach, we
recently provided proof-of-principle that gene silencing
associated with H3K27me3 was increased in malignant
MM cells compared to their normal counterparts [15].
We therefore hypothesized that Polycomb gene targeting
may contribute to MM tumorigenesis. In this study, we
sought to investigate the genome-wide distribution of
H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 marks in MM by performing
ChIP-sequencing on freshly isolated CD138+-sorted cells
from four newly diagnosed MM patients (Figure S1 and
Table S1). At time of sampling, characterization by FISH
analysis was not part of clinical routine at the sample
collection center, thus MM patient stratification other than
according to the international staging system (ISS) was
not available. Subsequent FISH analysis was performed
on patient whole bone marrow smear samples collected
at diagnosis but did not produce a positive signal for the
most common chromosomal abnormalities observed in
MM including t(4;14), t(11;14), t(14;16), t(8;14) and +8
(data not shown).
We then generated enriched regions with
H3K27me3, H3K4me3, or with both marks present
(bivalent) for the four MM patient samples (Figure 1A1C). Based on the selection criteria of mark enrichment
we compiled lists of 1205 targets of H3K27me3 common
among the four patients, 5269 common genes enriched for
H3K4me3, and 281 common bivalent genes (Table S5).
The corresponding number of peaks assigned for each
chromatin profile in each patient and their contribution to
the common lists are outlined in Table S6.
To correlate the presence of a defined chromatin
mark to transcriptional activity we compared the
enrichment for each chromatin mark among all patients
to data obtained by RNA-sequencing from CD138+
cells derived from patient 3 (Figure 1D). H3K27me3
commonly marks silenced genes [23, 24] while H3K4me3
is a hallmark of actively transcribed genes [25]. We found
both H3K27me3 and bivalent genes to have significantly
lower expression than H3K4me3 targets. Bivalent genes
showed significantly higher expression when compared
with H3K27me3 targets. To gain a deeper knowledge
of the genes defined by each chromatin mark and how

they functionally relate to each other, we performed
hierarchical clustering based on functional annotation of
the genes as defined for each patient (Figure 1E). Notably,
the bivalent genes shared a similar profile with genes
enriched for H3K27me3 alone forming one cluster with
similar functional groups, while the H3K4me3-marked
genes formed a separate cluster.

plasma cells and, by using the generated enrichment as
background to the MM patient samples, we defined
2551 H3K27me3-enriched genes that were common to
all MM patients used in this study and unique to MM
when compared to normal bone marrow plasma cells.
Secondly, we intersected these 2551 genes with the MM
1205 H3K27me3 targets defined in the first results section
when patient data was analyzed alone to obtain a more
stringent list of 1124 H3K27me3-enriched genes common
to all patients and unique to MM when compared with
normal bone marrow plasma cells (Figure 2A). Thirdly,
to exclude the possibility that bivalent genes were present
within the list of 1124 H3K27me3 targets, the bivalent
genes defined for each patient were removed from this list.
This resulted in 374 genes enriched for H3K27me3 only,
which are common and unique to MM patients (Table S7).
Subsequently, we examined the 374 H3K27me3 targets in
MM for overlaps with previously-defined concepts in the

Oncomine database [26], and found significant association
to previously-defined Polycomb targets in human
embryonic fibroblasts [27] and in human embryonic stem
cells [28] (Table 1).
Furthermore, we compared the MM-unique
H3K27me3-enriched genes to expression data from large
and independent MM patient cohorts available through
Oncomine. We found that the H3K27me3-enriched genes
in MM significantly overlapped with underexpressed
genes in ISS stage III as compared with ISS stage I and II
[29] (Figure 2B and Table 2). In addition, the H3K27me3
genes were significantly enriched among underexpressed
genes in plasma cell leukemia (PCL), representative
of disseminated tumor at advanced stages of the MM
disease, when compared to MGUS and MM together [29].
Notably, H3K27me3-enriched genes in MM significantly
overlapped with genes underexpressed in MM patients
with poor survival [30, 31] (Figure 2C and Table 2 ).

Interestingly, the number of bivalent genes increased
in MM when compared with normal plasma cells, with
a very small number of genes overlapping between
these two entities (Figure 2D and Table S7). Similar
to H3K27me3 targets, MM-unique bivalent genes
were significantly enriched among previously-defined
Polycomb targets in human embryonic fibroblasts [27]
and human embryonic stem cells [28] (Table 3). However,
in contrast to H3K27me3-enriched genes, bivalent genes
further overlapped with genes found to be reactivated
upon knockdown of Polycomb proteins [27] (Table 3).
Furthermore, the MM-bivalent genes overlapped with
genes underexpressed in MM cell lines when compared
with other cancer cell lines of both solid and hematopoietic
origin (Table 4, Figure 2E). Also, the MM-bivalent genes
overlapped with the top 10% overexpressed genes in MM
as compared with MGUS and PCL [32].

Bivalent domains increase in MM as compared

Pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 reduces

The MM-common bivalent genes defined in this
study were transcriptionally inactive and functionally
resembled the H3K27me3 targets (Figure 1D and 1E).

Based on the above, we hypothesized that Polycomb
gene targeting may be of clinical relevance in MM. Thus,
we further investigated whether inhibition of the EZH2

methyltransferase activity would demonstrate antimyeloma effects in vitro. To explore this, we assessed the
effect of the newly-developed specific EZH2 inhibitors
UNC1999 [33] and GSK343 [34] on the viability of a
panel of authenticated MM cell lines using the Alamar
Blue assay. The human diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

inhibition [33, 35, 36], was used as a control. Ablation

and Figure S2). The viability of the MM cell line INA6 was strongly suppressed by both inhibitors at a similar
concentration range that has previously been demonstrated
for Karpas-422 (Figure 3A and 3B). However, all MM cell
lines included in this study harbored wild type EZH2 SET
domain as identified by Sanger cDNA sequencing (data
not shown).
Next, we investigated whether EZH2 inhibition
induces apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and reduces colony
formation in MM cells. As a control treatment we

reduced MM cell viability by induction of apoptosis.
Treatment with UNC1999 increased the number of
apoptotic cells from 25% to 50% in the INA-6 cell line,
from 19% to 40% in the RPMI-8226 cell line and from
10% to 18% in the LP-1 cell line (Figure 3C), while cell
cycle arrest was not observed (data not shown). Similar
effects were observed when cells were treated with
GSK343 (Figure 3D). Induction of apoptosis by UNC1999
was further supported by the cleavage of caspase-8, 9 and
3 (Figure S3B). Furthermore, UNC1999 significantly
inhibited colony formation by the MM cell lines INA-6
and RPMI-8226 (Figure 3E). Moreover, we examined

Treatment with UNC1999 did not affect the global levels

both datasets into ten bins based on their expression levels
with the first bin having the least expressed genes and the
tenth bin having the most highly expressed genes. This
showed that while the genes with moderate expression
levels were randomly distributed across middle bins
(fourth to seventh), there was selective enrichment of
common genes in the bin pairs representing lowest (1246
genes in first bin pair) or highest (871 genes in the last bin
pair) expression levels (Figure 4A, black line). We then
analyzed if the H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 marks obtained
from MM patients correlated with the silenced or highlytranscribed genes common to INA-6 and MM datasets.
Overall, we observed significant correlation (p <0.0001)
between the transcriptional activity and the presence of
the chromatin marks. The genes commonly silenced (first
bin pair) and commonly highly-expressed (last bin pair)
associated with H3K27me3 (blue line) and H3K4me3
(red line) marks respectively. The bivalent histone marks
(green line) were enriched in the intermediate bin pairs
with no selective depletion in highly expressed or silenced
genes (Figure 4A).

EZH2 inhibition by UNC1999 induces
pro-apoptotic gene expression and
downregulates oncogenes in MM
To dissect the underlying molecular mechanisms for
the UNC1999 induced anti-myeloma effect, we performed
gene expression microarray analysis on the INA-6 cell line
after treatment with 2 µM UNC1999 or UNC2400 for 72
hours. In order to investigate how well the corresponding
gene expression pattern of INA-6 cells represented that
of the MM patient cells used for the ChIP-seq analysis,
we compared the expression data sets of UNC2400-treated

UNC1999 treatment of INA-6 significantly (p=0.02
and fold change of ≥ and ≤ 1.5) altered the expression
of 114 transcripts when compared with UNC2400,
of which 72 genes were upregulated and 42 genes
were downregulated (Table S8). Pathway analysis of
the upregulated genes revealed that EZH2 inhibition
using UNC1999 significantly upregulated transcripts
related to apoptosis, Wnt, ID, MAPK, insulin signaling
pathways and cellular differentiation (Figure 4B). The
downregulated genes were mainly involved in metabolic
activity. Of particular importance is that the inhibition of
EZH2 downregulated genes, such as JUNB, CD69 and
XBP1, which are known to have oncogenic properties in
MM [37–42] (Table S8). The changes in gene expression
upon UNC1999 treatment were verified for selected genes
by RT-qPCR (Figure 4C and 4D and Figure S6B) and
bioinformatics analysis (Figure S6A).
In addition, the upregulated gene signature upon
UNC1999 treatment was compared to the unique bivalent
and H3K27me3 targets common among the MM patients
included in this study. Notably, overlap was only observed
among the bivalent genes (p <0.001) (Figure S5A). To
examine the chromatin state of the overlapping genes in
the INA-6 cell line, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis.
We found EZH2 recruitment at all loci of interest as
well as comparable enrichment for both H3K27me3 and
H3K4me3 for ID2, FAM65B and SORL1, whereas a
higher enrichment for H3K4me3 than for H3K27me3 was
observed at SOX2 (Figure S5B).

Polycomb targets and their function in development and
differentiation [17].
To distinguish between developmental regulators
targeted by Polycomb during normal plasma cell
differentiation and those aberrantly silenced in MM, we
filtered out H3K27me3-enriched regions in normal bone
marrow plasma cells derived from age-matched healthy
donors. To examine the Polycomb target genes unique
to MM, the gene lists of H3K27me3-only and bivalent
targets were analyzed using Oncomine and found to
significantly overlap with previously-defined Polycomb
targets in human embryonic fibroblasts [27] and in human
embryonic stem cells [28]. Notably, such findings have
previously been used to define a stem cell-like phenotype
in poorly differentiated cancers and have been linked to
tumor aggressiveness [45, 46]. In contrast, the malignant
cell of MM represents a post-germinal center, isotypeswitched, terminally differentiated long-lived plasma cell
[3], which makes this connection to stem cell-like features
intriguing and suggests that gene silencing may be an
important process during tumor development by possibly
preserving proliferation over differentiation. Interestingly,
an aberrant epigenetic program persisting through the
normal cell differentiation process was implicated in
tumor initiation when hematopoietic progenitors were
proposed to be cells of origin in MM [47]. At what stage
during B cell differentiation the MM-associated Polycomb
gene targeting and silencing is established and if this is
required for transformation remains to be elucidated.
Upon further analysis using Oncomine, a significant
correlation with gene expression data from large MM
cohorts was identified. H3K27me3-only targets were
significantly enriched among genes underexpressed in
MM plasma cells when compared to MGUS and normal
bone marrow plasma cells [29, 48, 49]. Notably, the MM
H3K27me3-enriched genes significantly overlapped
with underexpressed genes in the more aggressive MM
ISS stage III [50] as compared with stage I and II [29].
Importantly, we also found that H3K27me3 targets in
MM define a set of genes underexpressed in patients with
a poor survival as defined by two independent studies [30,
31]. This correlation warrants further investigation on how
Polycomb gene targeting associates with the molecular
classification of MM [30] and the possibility that aberrant
Polycomb targeting may be present among several highrisk molecular subgroups.
Interestingly, we found an increased number of
bivalent genes in MM when compared with normal plasma
cells, with a small number of overlapping genes. This is
reminiscent of recent findings in germinal center derived
B-cell lymphoma reporting a disease-specific increase of
bivalent domains [51]. When the common MM-bivalent
genes were analyzed in the Oncomine database we found
that they were enriched among the underexpressed genes
in MM cell lines as compared with other cancer cell
lines. Furthermore, the MM-bivalent genes were enriched

DISCUSSION
Development of targeted therapy for multiple
myeloma (MM) has been hampered by the complex
biology and extensive heterogeneity of the disease [2, 4–7,
43, 44]. Using integrative genomics, we have previously
identified Polycomb gene targeting as a common
denominator of underexpressed genes in the malignant
plasma cell [15]. In the current study, we show for the
first time the genome-wide enrichment of H3K27me3
and H3K4me3 in freshly isolated CD138+ cells from
newly-diagnosed MM patients. We observed a strong
correlation between the H3K27me3 mark and loss of
transcriptional activity, whereas H3K4me3 was associated
with highly transcriptionally active genes. Overall, the
bivalent genes appeared to be transcriptionally silent;
however, some transcriptional activity was evident when
compared to the H3K27me3-enriched genes. Consistent
with this, the bivalent genes clustered together with the
H3K27me3 genes when performing hierarchical clustering
based on gene ontology (GO) analysis of biological
processes. Further supporting this notion, the GO analysis
revealed that the myeloma H3K27me3 and bivalent
genes were enriched within development, differentiation,
morphogenesis and metabolism categories (data not
shown). This classification is in line with the nature of

among genes previously found to be reactivated upon
knockdown of Polycomb proteins. Notably, when we
defined upregulated genes in MM upon pharmacological
inhibition of EZH2 and compared those to the commonamong-patients H3K27me3-only and bivalent genes,
an overlap was only identified between the upregulated
genes and the bivalent genes. Upon closer inspection of
these genes, we found EZH2 recruitment and comparable
levels of H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 at 3/4 genes, which is
indicative of bivalency. Taken together, this suggests that
bivalent domains play an important role in MM, are poised
for expression upon external and internal stimuli and could
be amenable to pharmacological manipulation.
It is well established that the PRC2 methyltransferase
EZH2 functions as an oncogene in several cancers [20,
21]. EZH2 pathologic activation due to gain-of-function
mutations and the associated increase in H3K27me3
at target genes have been clearly demonstrated to be
essential for the development of germinal center derived
B-cell lymphomas [51–54]. EZH2 inhibition using small
molecule inhibitors shows potent anti-tumor effects and
has minimal toxic effects in vivo [33, 35, 51]. In MM,
EZH2 overexpression has previously been reported by
us and others [15, 22, 49], whereas recurrent mutations
have not been reported. In the current study, we explored
whether EZH2 inhibition using the selective inhibitors
UNC1999 [33] and GSK343 [34] had anti-myeloma
effects. Both inhibitors suppressed the growth of a panel
of MM cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner by
induction of apoptosis, but not through cell cycle arrest.
In addition, UNC1999 inhibited colony formation by the
INA-6 and RPMI-8226 cell lines. Interestingly, the MM
cell line INA-6 was sensitive to EZH2 inhibition in a dose
range previously demonstrated for the DLBCL cell line
Karpas-422, which harbors a gain-of-function mutation
in EZH2. However, all MM cell lines in this study had a
wild type EZH2 SET domain. Similarly, Beguelin et al.
found that sensitivity to EZH2 inhibition was determined
by dependence on EZH2 and the germinal center origin
of the tumor rather than EZH2 mutational status [51].
Furthermore, the MM cell lines included in this study were
representative of the major chromosomal translocations
detected in MM patients, and responsiveness to EZH2
inhibition was not found to correlate to any of the genetic
abnormalities present in the cell lines. Most importantly,
the majority (9/12) of CD138+ myeloma cells derived
from MM patients responded to UNC1999 treatment, at a
concentration range similar to that used in MM cell lines.
Considering this, and the fact that UNC1999, as well as
other novel EZH2 inhibitors, are available for use in vivo
[35, 55], it remains to be evaluated if EZH2 will constitute
a novel druggable target with potent anti-myeloma effect
in relevant murine models of MM.
We observed a global decrease in the levels of
H3K27 methylation marks, accompanied by an increase in
H3K27 acetylation as a result of treatment with UNC1999
and GSK343. Other histone marks such as H3K4me3,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

H3K36me2 and H3K9me2 remained unaltered, indicating
the target specificity of both inhibitors in MM. EZH2
inhibition using UNC1999 also reactivated the expression
of genes in pathways relevant to cancer such as apoptosis,
ID signaling and cellular differentiation. Resistance to
apoptosis has been linked to disease pathogenesis and
resistance to treatment in MM [56, 57]. The inhibitor of
DNA binding 2 (ID2) was significantly upregulated in the
INA-6 cell line upon treatment with UNC1999. ID2 is
an important mediator of both plasma cell differentiation
[58] and induction of apoptosis [59] and the ID signaling
pathway has previously been reported to be deregulated
in cancer [60, 61]. Moreover, we found the FcγRIIb
(FCGR2B) transcript among the significantly upregulated
genes. Notably, murine plasma cells that lack FcγRIIb
expression are resistant to apoptosis [62].
EZH2 inhibition by UNC1999 decreased the
expression of several oncogenes, which have been
demonstrated to be involved in MM, most notably JUNB,
CD69 and XBP1. JUNB has been recently shown to promote
MM cell growth, survival and drug resistance [37]. CD69 is
a B cell activation cell surface marker, which is suppressed
by BLIMP-1 during normal plasma cell differentiation [38].
However, CD69 is more expressed in MM and MGUS than
in normal samples [39] and is suggested to be a potential
clinical marker in MM [40]. XBP1 is critical in coordinating
normal plasma cell differentiation and survival by regulating
the unfolded protein response [41] and is reported to drive
MM pathogenesis in mice [42].
In conclusion, we present the first genome-wide
enrichment analysis of the Polycomb chromatin mark
H3K27me3 associated with gene silencing, as opposed
to the activating H3K4me3 mark in MM. We identified
that genes enriched for H3K27me3 in MM significantly
overlap with underexpressed genes in MM ISS stage
III and in MM patients with poor survival. We provide
evidence that EZH2 inhibition suppresses viability and
colony formation in MM cell lines, reduces survival of
primary MM cells and leads to the activation of apoptosis.
Collectively, these data suggest that EZH2, the enzymatic
subunit of PRC2, is a potential therapeutic target in MM.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary cells
Heparinized bone marrow samples were obtained
from newly-diagnosed MM patients in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the local ethics
committees of Uppsala and Stockholm (Dnr 2004:M-332
and 2010/1478-32) (Tables S1 and S2). Healthy bone
marrow samples were obtained from patients undergoing
selective hip replacement surgery at Karolinska University
Hospital. The study was approved by the regional ethical
committee (2012/517-32), and all patients gave informed
consent. Subjects were considered hematologically
healthy if peripheral blood counts were normal, with no

signs of inflammation and no history of use of any drugs
known to affect hematopoiesis. During surgery, 5-15 mL
bone marrow was removed and placed in RPMI media
containing 1% glutamax and 16.7 IU/ mL heparin.
Mononuclear cells were separated by FicollPaque™ PLUS density sedimentation (Amersham
Biosciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and subjected to CD138
immunomagnetic purification by Whole Blood Column
Kit (MACS, Miltenyi Biotec, Paris, France) according
to the manufacturer’s protocols. Subsequently, the purity
of the CD138-enriched fraction was evaluated by MayGrünwald-Giemsa staining and samples with purity above
85% for MM, and above 80% for healthy controls were
included in the study (Tables S1 and S2).

A hematopoietic colony-forming cell assay was
performed using the CytoSelect 96-well Hematopoietic
Colony Forming Cell Assay kit according to the
manufacturer's protocol (Cell Biolabs). Briefly,
100  000 - 500 000 cells/mL were plated in CytoSelect
methylcellulose medium in 96-well culture plates in the
presence of 2 µM UNC1999 or UNC2400. At 7 days,
colonies were quantified using a fluorescence plate reader
(485/520 nm filter set) using Wallac VICTOR Multilabel
Counter (Wallac, Turku, Finland).

Protein extraction and western blot
Cells were seeded, treated with DMSO, UNC2400
or a range of concentrations of UNC1999 and harvested
at the indicated time-points. For global analysis of
chromatin modifications by western blot, histone proteins
were extracted using the Episeeker histone extraction
kit (abcam, Ab113476) following the manufacturer’s
procedure. For caspases activation analysis, cells were
collected by centrifugation at 1500 rpm for 5  minutes,
washed with ice-cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing
1% NP40, 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 5 mM EDTA
and protease inhibitors 1 mM ZnCl2, 50 mM Na2MoO4,
10 mM NaF, 0.1 mM NaVO3, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM DTT,
1× complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche,
Mannheim, Germany). Cell lysates were collected by
centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 10 minutes. Proteins
were fractionated on NuPAGE® Novex® Bis-Tris
gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and transferred onto
a nitrocellulose membrane using the iBlot® system
(Invitrogen). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in TBS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.7, 150 mM
NaCl) with 0.1% Tween 20 (TTBS) at room temperature
for 1 hour, incubated with the indicated primary antibodies
overnight at 4°C, washed in TTBS and incubated for
1 hour at room temperature with the corresponding
secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies (Amersham
Biosciences) in 5% non-fat dry milk in TTBS. Antibodies
used are listed in Table S3.

Cell culture
All MM authenticated cell lines [63] and primary
cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 AQmediaTM
(Sigma) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma), 1%
GlutaMax™-I (Gibco) and antibiotics (penicillin 100 U/
mL and streptomycin 50 mg/mL; Sigma) at 37°C in a
humidified 5% CO2 in-air atmosphere. For experiments,
exponentially growing cells were seeded at 100 000
cells/mL unless otherwise stated. Cells were incubated
overnight before addition of reagents. Medium and
reagents were refreshed at day 3. Primary cells were
maintained at 1 × 106 cells/mL in the presence of IL-6.

Cell viability assay
MM cell lines were treated with a range of
concentrations of UNC1999 (or GSK343) or with DMSO
for 6 days, while primary cells were treated with 4 µM
UNC1999 or UNC2400 for 72h. On the day of analysis,
cells were seeded in triplicate wells in 96-well flat-bottom
plates for cell lines and U-bottom plates for patient
samples. Cell viability was assessed using Resazurin
assay using AlamarBlue (Sigma-Aldrich) as previously
described [15]. Only samples where the control treatment
reached fluorescence levels of at least 5 × the background
for cell lines and at least 2 × the background for patient
samples were included in the analysis.

RNA extraction, RNA array, cDNA synthesis and
quantitative real time qRT-PCR

Apoptosis assay

RNA extraction for RNA-seq was done from
1 × 106 CD138-selected cells from patient number 3
using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Similarly, for the INA-6 cell
line microarray the RNA was extracted from the cells
using RNASpin mini (GE Healthcare) after 72h of
treatment with 2 µM UNC1999. The labeling of the RNA
for microarray and hybridization were done according
the Affymetrix manufacturer’s protocol (Affymetrix).
The data was analyzed using GeneSpring 13 software
using quantile normalization and ExonRMA 16 was

Cells were cultured for 72 hours in the absence
(DMSO control) or presence of EZH2 inhibitor (2 µM
UNC1999 or GSK343). Apoptosis was quantified by
Annexin V (AV)-fluorescein isothocyanate (FITC) and
PI staining using TACS Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Kit
(R&D Systems, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Samples were
treated according to manufacturer’s recommendations
and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACScan), presenting
apoptotic cells as Annexin V-positive/PI-negative cells and
necrotic cells as Annexin V-positive/PI-positive cells.

genes were obtained using moderated t-test with the
p < 0.02 and fold change 1.5. cDNA preparations were
done using Invitrogen kit as per the manufacturer’s
protocol. For qPCR TaqMan® (Invitrogen) and SYBR®
Green (Invitrogen) chemistry was used according the
manufacturers’ protocols (Table S4).

were defined by using normal plasma cell input in the
similar manner described for the patient bivalent. Peaks
were annotated around the transcriptional start site (TSS)
using PeakAnalyzer software [65]. The annotation file
used was Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.58.gtf.gz. Genes were
enriched for H3K27me3 if a peak was detected up to 2.5
kb upstream of the TSS, through the whole gene body
and up to 2.5 kb beyond the 3’ end of the gene; genes
were enriched for H3K4me3 if a peak was up to 2.5 kb up
and downstream of the TSS; and for bivalent peaks 5 kb
up and downstream of the TSS. The bivalent genes were
generated by intersecting the overlapping regions in the
peak bed files, created by the second criteria as mentioned
above, using the BEDTools software [66].

Chromatin immunoprecipitation
ChIP was performed on either freshly isolated
CD138-selected cells or on the exponentially growing
INA-6 cell line by using a modified version of the
OneDay ChIP kit (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) as
previously described [15]. Chromatin was sonicated (30
sec ON/30 sec OFF) at ultrasonic wave output power
320 W in Bioruptor® (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) until
DNA fragments accumulated within 200 to 500 bp size.
The immunoprecipitation was performed using 10 µg of
chromatin per 1 µg antibody. A list of the antibodies used
in this study is found in supplementary data (Table S3).
DNA was purified using phenol/chloroform precipitation
when samples were submitted for ChIP sequencing
and by following the OneDay ChIP kit manufacturer’s
protocol.

Annotations
Functional annotation was performed using GOStats
software (Beissbarth and Speed 2004). For each patient
the genes carrying the unique H3K27me3 or H3K4me3
chromatin mark were selected based on the criteria
described above, then bivalent genes of each patient
were removed and the file was annotated for biological
functions. Hierarchical clustering was done using R on
the P-values obtained by GOStats functional annotation.
Footprints of the histone marks surrounding the peaks
were created using the SICTIN software and custom
R-scripts (Enroth, Andersson et al. 2010).

Sequencing, library preparation and
reads alignment
SOLiD™ (Life Technologies) platform was
used for sequencing, the library preparation was done
according to SOLiD™ protocol for both ChIP-seq and
RNA-seq libraries and raw reads were obtained in color
space. ChIP-seq reads were aligned using BioScope (Life
technologies, CA) while input and RNA-seq reads were
aligned using LifeScope (Life Technologies, CA). The
reads (Table S9) were mapped uniquely to the reference
human genome library hg19. All data have been submitted
to the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository under
the accession GSE53215.

Statistical analysis
Student t-test, Wilcoxon test, chi-square test and
moderated t-test were calculated using R and GraphPad
Prism.

calling. Three criteria were used to call the peaks;
first calling the peaks in the patients the bam file for
H3K27me3 was used as a test and H3K4me3 file of the
same patient as control and vice-versa. Second, an input
bam file from one of the patients was used as a control
for calling patient H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 peaks and
overlapping peaks from these were designated as bivalent.
Third, for calling the patients unique peaks for H3K27me3
and H3K4me3 the patients’ bam files were used as test
and normal plasma cell bam files of H3K27me3 and
H3K4me3 as control. Normal plasma cell bivalent genes
