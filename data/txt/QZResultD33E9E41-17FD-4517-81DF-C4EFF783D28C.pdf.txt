BACKGROUND: For patients with stage III through IVB head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), concurrent high-dose
cisplatin plus radiation therapy is a widely accepted standard of care. HNSCC tumors that express high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor have been associated with a worse prognosis, and bevacizumab may sensitize tumors to cisplatin and radiation.
METHODS: Planned treatment consisted of definitive intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) (total, 70 grays) with concurrent
cisplatin (50 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 22, 23, 43, and 44) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on days 1, 22, and 43). The primary endpoint was 2year progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) was a secondary endpoint. RESULTS: Forty-two previously untreated
patients (34 men and 8 women; median age, 55 years; range, 27-75 years) with stage III through IV HNSCC without distant metastasis
(oropharyngeal carcinoma, 39 patients; laryngeal carcinoma, 3 patients) were treated. Human papillomavirus (HPV) status by was
determined by in situ hybridization (HPV positive, 16 patients; HPV negative, 14 patients, unknown HPV status, 12 patients). The toxicities (determined according to version 3.0 of Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Common) that were experienced by
all patients (any grade) were mucositis, lymphopenia, leukopenia, throat pain, fatigue, and anemia. There were 2 treatment-related
deaths, including 1 sudden death and 1 death from aspiration pneumonia. The median follow-up was approximately 31.8 months
(range, <3 to 51 months). The 2-year PFS rate was 75.9% (95% confidence interval, 63.9%-90.1%), and the 2-year OS rate was 88%
(95% confidence interval, 78.6%-98.4%). Among 32 patients for whom post-treatment Head and Neck Performance Status Scores
were obtained (median, 5.6 months after completing radiation therapy), scores of 100 for eating, speech, and diet, respectively, were
recorded among 75%, 84%, and 50% of patients. BACKGROUND: The addition of bevacizumab to high-dose cisplatin plus IMRT did
not appear to increase toxicity to unacceptable levels among patients with HNSCC, and the efficacy results were encouraging. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
For patients with locally and/or regionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), concurrent highdose cisplatin plus radiation therapy is a widely accepted standard of care.1-5 The acute and chronic treatment-related
toxicities of this regimen limit the addition of another cytotoxic agent, but the addition of targeted (or biologic) agents to
concurrent chemoradiation is a strategy to potentially improve efficacy while maintaining tolerability.
Bevacizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that binds vascular endothelial growth factor A
(VEGF-A), was the first antiangiogenesis agent to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval in oncology.6 At
the time the randomized studies were ongoing that led to the approval of bevacizumab as part of treatment regimens for
certain patients with advanced colon cancer and nonsmall cell lung cancer,6 preclinical and early clinical data accumulated
in support of the study of this agent in patients with HNSCC. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies that evaluated VEGF-A
expression in HNSCC (n ¼ 1002 patients), tumors with positive VEGF status were associated with a 1.88-fold greater
risk of death at 2 years.7 The inhibition of antiangiogenesis achieved radiosensitization in preclinical models of solid
tumors,8-10 suggesting that clinical studies incorporating VEGF inhibition should be developed for cancers that are commonly treated with radiotherapy, such as HNSCC.
A phase 1 trial at the University of Chicago demonstrated that it is feasible to add bevacizumab (10 mg/kg every 2
weeks) to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) plus hydroxyurea (FHX) with radiation therapy for patients with poor prognosis

Phase 2 Bevacizumab, CDDP, and RT/Fury et al

HNSCC.11 Most patients in this study had received previous radiation therapy for head and neck cancer. The recommended chemotherapy doses to be given with
radiotherapy were oral hydroxyurea 500 mg twice daily,
5-FU 600 mg/m2 daily as a continuous infusion on days 1
through 5, and bevacizumab 10 mg/kg on day 1 of a 14day cycle. These reductions in the doses of 5-FU and
hydroxyurea, compared with the standard FHX regimen,
were required because of increased neutropenia associated
with the addition of bevacizumab. There were 2 fatal
hemorrhages among 43 patients, which was similar to the
incidence of hemorrhage described in previous reirradiation HNSCC studies.11 In contrast to an early report in
which bevacizumab was associated with an increased risk
of hemorrhage in squamous cell carcinomas of the lung,12
this phase 1 study provided reassurance that bevacizumab
does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of
hemorrhage in patients with HNSCC.11
Although various chemotherapeutic agents have
been combined with radiation therapy for patients with
newly diagnosed stage III through IVB HNSCC, cisplatin
is the drug with the most data to support its use in this setting.1-4 The addition of bevacizumab to standard cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy in this patient population
was deemed an appropriate topic for clinical study, both
because of the apparent tolerability of VEGF inhibition
among HNSCC patients11,13 and because of the radiosensitizing potential of VEGF inhibition.8-10 We designed
and conducted a single-institution, nonrandomized,
phase 2 study in which bevacizumab (15 mg/kg intravenously every 3 weeks) was added to high-dose cisplatin
and concurrent radiation therapy (intensity-modulated
radiation therapy [IMRT]).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This single-institution, nonrandomized, open-label,
phase 2 study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.
Patient Eligibility and Baseline Assessment

Eligible patients had previously untreated, stage III
through IVB HNSCC without distant metastasis (M0).
Other key inclusion criteria were a Karnofsky performance status 70%, adequate bone marrow function (absolute neutrophil count, 1500/lL; platelets, 100,000/
lL; hemoglobin, 9 g/dL), adequate renal function (serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL and/or calculated creatinine
clearance 55 mL per minute [calculated according to
the Cockcroft and Gault equation]), and adequate hepatic
function (total bilirubin 1.5 times the upper normal

limit [UNL], aspartate aminotransferase 1.5 times the
UNL, alanine aminotransferase 1.5 times the UNL, and
alkaline phosphatase 1.5 times the UNL).
Key exclusion criteria were: hearing loss or multifocal peripheral sensory alterations or paresthesias interfering with activities of daily living; a history of arterial
thromboembolic events within the last 3 years; a urine
protein:creatinine ratio 1.0; current use of warfarin,
heparin, or low-molecular weight heparin; chronic daily
treatment with aspirin (>325 mg daily) or nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory medications known to inhibit platelet
function; gross hemoptysis or hematemesis (defined as
bright red blood 1 teaspoon) within 28 days before day
0 of protocol treatment; an anatomic lesion that increased
the risk of serious hemorrhage, such as encasement or
invasion of major blood vessels by primary tumor and/or
by involved lymph nodes; blood pressure >150/100 mm
Hg; major surgical procedure or significant traumatic
injury within 28 days before treatment with bevacizumab;
or a core biopsy within 15 days before treatment with
bevacizumab.
All patients provided written informed consent
before enrollment in the study. A percutaneous gastrostomy (PEG) tube was placed pretreatment for all patients,
consistent with practice at our institution at the time of
the conduct of this study. For patients who had adequate
tissue available, the presence of high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) strains (including HPV type 16) was
determined by in situ hybridization using the Ventana
HPV Family 16 probe (Ventana Medical Systems, Inc.,
Tucson, Ariz).14
Study Treatment

Chemotherapy treatment consisted of planned cisplatin
(50 mg/m2 on days 1, 2, 22, 23, 43, and 44) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg on days 1, 22, and 43). Each planned 21day chemotherapy treatment period was defined as a
cycle. Cisplatin and/or bevacizumab could be administered up to 3 days before the scheduled date if necessary
for medical or personal reasons. The treatment schema is
illustrated in Figure 1. The initial version of the protocol
called for an additional 6 months of maintenance bevacizumab after chemoradiation, but this was discontinued in
an amendment after a grade 4 pulmonary hemorrhage
event in Patient 1 during maintenance treatment.
Cisplatin dose reduction was allowed for grade 3
adverse events, and specific guidelines were provided for
common cisplatin-related toxicities (hematologic, renal,
auditory, and neurologic toxicities). Cisplatin dose level
1 was 50 mg/m2 only on the first day of the cycle, which

months for 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years,
and annually thereafter.

represented a 50% dose reduction. Bevacizumab would
be discontinued for any grade 2 hemorrhagic event or
any thrombotic event requiring anticoagulation. Bevacizumab dose reductions were not allowed, but bevacizumab would be held for any toxicity grade 3 until
resolution to grade 1. Dose modification in chemotherapy did not mandate any dose interruption or modification in planned radiotherapy.
Concurrent with chemotherapy, IMRT was delivered on a standard schedule of 5 days per week (excluding
weekends and holidays) in 1 fraction daily of 212 centigrays (cGy) up to a total dose of 7000 cGy. Patients with
high-risk subclinical disease received a total of 5940 cGy,
whereas patients with lower risk subclinical disease
received 5400 cGy. All treatments were given over
approximately 33 days using an IMRT dose-painting
technique.
Evaluation During Study and
Response Assessment

Adverse events during treatment were assessed at weekly
clinic visits using version 3.0 of the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
(CTCAE). Between 3 and 4 months after completion of
chemoradiation, radiologic assessment was performed
(whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan plus computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging studies of the
neck). Patients who had evidence of persistent disease in
the head and neck after chemoradiation would have surgery planned for 60 days after the last bevacizumab infusion. For patients who maintained active follow-up after
chemoradiation, clinic visits took place at least every 3
5010

The primary objective of this study was to determine 2year progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with
locally or regionally advanced HNSCC who received concurrent IMRT, cisplatin, and bevacizumab. The secondary objective was to determine the median overall survival
(OS) of these patients. All patients who received any treatment on study were included in the efficacy and safety
analyses.
At the time this study was designed, a review of concurrent chemoradiotherapy supported using a 45% rate as
the baseline estimate for 2-year PFS.1,3,15-17 To detect an
improvement in the 2-year PFS rate from 45% to 65%,
the study required 42 patients (5% type I error; 20% type
II error). Time endpoints were measured from the start of
treatment until the time of first reported distant or local/
regional failure or until death from any cause, consistent
with published HNSCC chemoradiation literature.17
Data were censored at the time of last follow-up for
patients without distant or local/regional failure. PFS and
the median OS were estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier
method.
The safety and tolerability of bevacizumab were central concerns during the design of the protocol. The study
included an early stopping rule for any unanticipated toxicity, and criteria for closure of the study according to the
early stopping rule were not met during the conduct of
this study.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Forty-four patients were enrolled on the study between
November 20, 2006 and October 22, 2008. Two patients
withdrew consent before receiving any treatment on the
study, and the results detailed below pertain to the 42
patients who received any treatment on study.
Most patients were men (81%), the primary tumor
site was oropharynx in 93% of patients, and most patients
had stage IVA disease (76%). HPV DNA was detectable
in the majority of tumors for which adequate material was
available for in situ hybridization analysis. Twenty-nine
patients (69%) had <10 pack-years of tobacco exposure.

cycles of bevacizumab plus cisplatin at the full dose
because of toxicity. However, 37 of 42 patients (88%)
were able to receive at least 2 of the 3 planned cycles of
bevacizumab and cisplatin at the full dose.
Table 2 lists the adverse events that occurred in
30% of treated patients (regardless of grade) or events
that were grade 3 in at least 2 patients and were possibly,
probably, or definitely related to bevacizumab. Adverse
events (any grade) experienced by all patients were mucositis (functional), lymphopenia, leukopenia, throat pain,
fatigue, and low hemoglobin. The most common grade
3 adverse events were lymphopenia (100% of patients),
mucositis (86% of patients), throat pain (74% of
patients), and neutropenia (43% of patients). There were
2 deaths within 90 days of the last treatment, including 1
death from aspiration pneumonia and 1 sudden death of
unclear etiology, although pulmonary embolus was suspected clinically.
Patient 1 experienced a grade 4 pulmonary hemorrhage during maintenance bevacizumab treatment after
the completion of chemoradiation. This patient did not
have lung metastases, and it was believed that the event
was related to pneumonia and bevacizumab. This patient

remained without evidence of cancer at the time of this
writing. After this grade 4 event in Patient 1, the protocol
was amended, and no further patients received maintenance bevacizumab after chemoradiation (see Materials
and Methods, above).
Efficacy

PFS and OS are illustrated in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. The median follow-up was 31.8 months as of April
30, 2011. The 2-year PFS rate was 75.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 63.9%-90.1%), and the 2-year OS
rate was is 88% (95% CI, 78.6%-98.4%).
Seven patients have developed recurrent disease.
The first sites of failure were distant metastases for 5
patients (including lung in 3 patients; bone in 2 patients;
and liver, stomach, peritoneum, and abdominal lymph
node in 1 patient each). For 1 patient, disease recurrence
was discovered concurrently in the regional neck lymph
nodes and the lung. For 1 patient, the initial recurrence
was at the site of the primary oropharyngeal tumor.
Locoregional failure was suspected in 1 other patient but
was not proven histologically. This patient was a man
aged 54 years with a base of tongue squamous cell carcinoma (T4aN2cM0) who presented at an outside hospital

Late Functional Outcomes:

A man aged 68 years who had a base of tongue squamous
cell carcinoma (T3N2cM0) and type 2 diabetes mellitus
had delayed healing of an ulcer at the primary tumor site
that required surgical debridement 7 months after
completion of chemoradiation. Now, >4 years status
postchemoradiation, he remains without evidence of
disease and tolerates a full diet.
Post-treatment speech and swallowing function was
evaluated with the Performance Status Scale for Head and
Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN) among 32 patients.18
The median interval between completion of radiation
therapy and the initial post-treatment HN-PSS assessment for 32 patients was 5.6 months (range, 1.3-26
months). Post-treatment HN-PSS results are provided in
Table 3. Median scores for eating, speech, and diet were
100, 100, and 95, respectively. For 10 patients, HN-PSS
follow-up data were not obtained because of recurrent disease or death (n ¼ 6), lost to follow-up (n ¼ 3), or data
not obtained by investigator (n ¼ 1).
DISCUSSION
This phase 2 study demonstrated the feasibility and
encouraging efficacy of the addition of bevacizumab to
the widely accepted regimen of high-dose cisplatin every 3
weeks given concurrently with IMRT for patients with
locally and/or regionally advanced HNSCC. The 2-year
PFS rate, which was the primary endpoint of the study,
5012

was 75.9%. Adverse events associated with the study
regimen were similar to those described in prior studies of
concurrent radiation and high-dose cisplatin for this
patient population, although myelosuppression appeared
to be increased compared with prior studies of cisplatin
monotherapy.
At the time this study was designed, there were concerns about the possible risk of hemorrhage with bevacizumab among patients with squamous cell carcinomas.12
Our results indicate that the risk of tumor hemorrhage
with bevacizumab-based combined modality therapy for
HNSCC is low in appropriately selected patients. It is important to note the extensive exclusion criteria used in this
study to minimize risk of bleeding complications. For
example, the study excluded patients who had encasement
of the carotid artery and patients on full-dose aspirin or
therapeutic anticoagulation. Further clinical research
would be needed to determine whether bevacizumab may
be administered safely in an HNSCC population not subjected to these extensive exclusion criteria.
There were 2 deaths within 90 days of completing
the study treatment (1 death from aspiration pneumonia
Cancer

and 1 sudden death of unclear etiology). The reported
rates of treatment-related death among patients with
HNSCC who receive cisplatin-based chemoradiation
range from 1% to 5%. The combined results from 4 trials
indicate that the rate of acute treatment-related death
from standard cisplatin-based chemoradiation for locally
advanced HNSCC is approximately 4%.1-3,19 The results
from the current study do not suggest that the addition of
bevacizumab increases the risks of treatment-related death
associated with chemoradiation. The results from Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) trial RTOG
0615, a phase 2 study of the addition of bevacizumab to
standard chemoradiation for locoregionally advanced
nasopharyngeal cancer, are consistent with the safety
experience in this study.20
We did not observe any clear evidence of increased
local toxicity. The high incidence of acute functional
mucositis grade 3 should be viewed in the context of the
protocol requirement that all patients had placement of
PEG tube before treatment. CTCAE version 3.0 defines
grade 3 functional mucositis as the inability to adequately
aliment or hydrate orally, and PEG tube use typically was
scored as grade 3 functional mucositis during the course
of treatment for the patients in this study. The incidence
of grade 3 clinical mucositis was much lower (21%),
indicating that bevacizumab did not appear to increase
the acute local toxicities of chemoradiation. Post-treatment HN-PSS scores indicate that long-term recovery of
speech and swallowing function was experienced by most
patients in this study.
The incidence of grade 3 leukopenia (57%) was
slightly higher than the 40% to 47% rate observed in
randomized phase 3 studies of radiation plus bolus cisplatin in patients with HNSCC.1,2 Although it is not possible to draw definitive conclusions based on comparisons
with phase 3 studies, these results suggest that the addition
of bevacizumab in this study may modestly intensify cisplatin-related leukopenia. This is consistent with a previous report that the myelosuppressive effects of cytotoxic
chemotherapy appeared to have been increased by the
addition of bevacizumab to the FHX regimen for patients
with head and neck cancer.11 To reduce the potential risk
of cumulative myelosuppression with 3 cycles of bolus cisplatin plus bevacizumab given concurrently with radiation
therapy, it may be prudent to limit future studies to 2
cycles of concurrent bolus cisplatin plus bevacizumab in
this patient population. We are conducting a follow-up
combined-modality study for patients with stage III
through IVB HNSCC that features only 2 cycles of cisplatin plus bevacizumab with concurrent radiation therapy.

Patients also receive weekly, concurrent cetuximab in that
follow-up study.21
The current study was designed for patients with
locally or regionally advanced HNSCC of any subsite.
However, in reality, 93% of patients on this study had
oropharyngeal primary tumors. The high incidence of
HPV-positive tumors and the tobacco histories (half of
the patients were never-smokers or light smokers [1
pack-year]) in this study underscore the changing demographics of HNSCC. Recent reports have identified a
gradual shift over 20 to 30 years toward an increasing
prevalence of HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma and a decrease in the incidence of tobaccorelated HNSCC in the United States and Western
Europe.22-24 This change has dramatic implications with
regard to prognosis. Data from RTOG 0129, a phase 3
study in which patients with locally and/or regionally
advanced HNSCC received cisplatin concurrently with
radiation therapy, demonstrated that 3-year OS among
patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell
carcinoma was superior to that of patients with HPV-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma.25 These
associations were not established at the time the current
study was designed and limit any attempt to compare efficacy data from the current study with the results in historical controls.
A randomized phase 2 study of FHX with or without bevacizumab for patients with head and neck cancer
was closed early to because of an increased locoregional
failure rate in the experimental arm.26 The addition of
bevacizumab to FHX required dose reductions on both 5FU and hydroxyurea compared with standard FHX.11,26
The reduced doses of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the FHX
plus bevacizumab regimen could be causal with regard to
the observed increased incidence of locoregional failure,
although the small sample size (26 patients) in the phase 2
study precludes definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of modified FHX plus bevacizumab.26 We did not
observe any evidence of decreased efficacy with the addition of bevacizumab to bolus cisplatin given with daily
IMRT in the current study.
This phase 2 study demonstrates that the addition of
bevacizumab to bolus cisplatin administered concurrently
with IMRT is feasible and yields encouraging efficacy
among patients with stage III/IVB HNSCC. The incidence of grade 3 leukopenia appears to have been modestly higher than that observed in prior studies of cisplatin
plus radiotherapy in this patient population. Although
the study met its predetermined efficacy endpoint for 2year PFS, comparisons with historic controls are difficult,

because earlier studies typically did not contain the abundant representation of favorable-prognosis, HPV-positive
oropharyngeal tumors that occurred in the current study.
In view of the tolerability of this bevacizumab and the
potential for bevacizumab to improve efficacy as a radiosensitizer and chemosensitizer, further prospective studies
with bevacizumab in this patient population are ongoing.
