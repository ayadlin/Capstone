Chemotherapeutic DNA Damage

Abstract
Loss-of-function mutations in the human RecQ helicase genes WRN and BLM respectively cause the genetic
instability/cancer predisposition syndromes Werner syndrome and Bloom syndrome. To identify common
and unique functions of WRN and BLM, we systematically analyzed cell proliferation, cell survival, and
genomic damage in isogenic cell lines depleted of WRN, BLM, or both proteins. Cell proliferation and survival
were assessed before and after treatment with camptothecin, cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II), hydroxyurea,
or 5-fluorouracil. Genomic damage was assessed, before and after replication arrest, by γ-H2AX staining,
which was quantified at the single-cell level by flow cytometry. Cell proliferation was affected strongly by
the extent of WRN and/or BLM depletion, and more strongly by BLM than by WRN depletion (P = 0.005).
The proliferation of WRN/BLM-codepleted cells, in contrast, did not differ from BLM-depleted cells (P = 0.34).
BLM-depleted and WRN/BLM-codepleted cells had comparably impaired survival after DNA damage, whereas
WRN-depleted cells displayed a distinct pattern of sensitivity to DNA damage. BLM-depleted and WRN/BLMcodepleted cells had similar, significantly higher γ-H2AX induction levels than did WRN-depleted cells. Our
results provide new information on the role of WRN and BLM in determining cell proliferation, cell survival,
and genomic damage after chemotherapeutic DNA damage or replication arrest. We also provide new information on functional redundancy between WRN and BLM. These results provide a strong rationale for further
developing WRN and BLM as biomarkers of tumor chemotherapeutic responsiveness. Cancer Res; 70(16); 6548–55.

Introduction
The human RecQ helicases are members of a deeply
conserved protein family that plays important, albeit poorly
understood, roles in DNA metabolism, genetic stability, and
response to DNA damage (1, 2). Germline loss-of-function
mutations in three human RecQ helicase genes, WRN, BLM,
and RECQL4, respectively cause Werner syndrome, Bloom
syndrome, and the subset of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome
associated with a high risk of osteosarcoma. These genetic
instability/cancer predisposition syndromes also have different developmental or acquired features. Werner syndrome patients develop features resembling premature aging beginning
in the second decade of life (3). Bloom syndrome patients, in

contrast, are proportionately small from birth, display sun
sensitivity and hypopigmented and hyperpigmented skin
lesions, are often immunodeficient, and have reduced fertility
(4). Rothmund-Thomson syndrome patients are typically
short with sparse hair and eyebrows; have variable skeletal,
dental, and nail abnormalities; and develop a persistent skin
rash in infancy together with a high risk of juvenile ocular
cataracts (5). Epigenetic loss of expression of RecQ helicases
may also be linked to human disease. For example, epigenetic
silencing of WRN expression has been documented and is
frequent in common adult epithelial malignancies such as
colorectal cancer (6, 7). No human disease has been linked
thus far to mutation or epigenetic inactivation of the two
other human RecQ helicase genes, RECQL or RECQL5 (1, 2).
All five human RecQ proteins share a conserved helicase
domain that encodes DNA-dependent ATPase and 3′-to-5′
helicase activities. WRN also encodes a 3′-to-5′ exonuclease
activity in an NH2-terminal domain. Purified human RecQ
helicases preferentially bind and unwind, and in the case of
WRN also degrade, partially double-stranded DNA molecules
including model replication forks, D- and T-loops or synthetic
Holliday junctions, and highly structured DNAs such a
G-quadruplexes. Several human RecQ helicases also possess
DNA strand annealing activity (1, 2, 8). Functional correlates
of these activities include a requirement for RecQ helicases in
homology-dependent recombination, in replication initiation,

in replication restart or fork elongation, and in DNA repair
(1, 2, 9–11).
To delineate redundant and unique in vivo functions of
WRN and BLM, we systematically analyzed cell proliferation,
genomic damage as assessed by γ-H2AX staining, and cell
survival in isogenic human cell lines depleted of WRN and/or
BLM, before and after treatment with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs. Our results provide new information on the
role of WRN and BLM in determining the response to chemotherapeutic damage and on functional redundancy between
WRN and BLM.

Materials and Methods
Cells and cell culture
The SV40-transformed GM639 human fibroblast cell line
developed from a normal donor was originally obtained from
the Coriell Institute Cell Repositories (Camden, NJ) in 1990.
GM639-cc1 is a clonal derivative of GM639 that carries an
integrated copy of the pNeoA direct repeat homologous
recombination reporter plasmid (12). The human osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS (13) was obtained from the American
Type Culture Collection in 2008. GM639 cells are functionally
TP53(−), whereas U-2 OS cells express TP53 protein and are
functionally TP53(+). Cell lines were initially DNA fingerprinted and screened to verify the absence of Mycoplasma
infection using PCR kits obtained from the Coriell Institute
Cell Repositories. Subsequent fingerprinting and Mycoplasma
screening verifications have been performed by the University
of Missouri Research Animal Diagnostic Laboratory (http://
www.radil.missouri.edu/). Recently thawed aliquots of both
lines were used for all experiments. GM639-cc1 cells were
grown in DMEM and U-2 OS cells in McCoy's 5A medium
(MediaTech CellGro) in a humidified 37°C, 7% incubator. Both
growth media were supplemented with 4,500 mg/L glucose,
10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS; Hyclone), and penicillin
(100 units/mL) and streptomycin sulfate (100 mg/mL; Invitrogen).

per well were plated in six-well plates 24 hours before drug
treatment, then treated for 24 hours, followed by 8 days of
growth in the absence of drug before crystal violet staining
to identify colonies containing ≥6 cells.
shRNA-mediated depletion of WRN and BLM
We screened WRN- and BLM-specific shRNAs designed by
The RNAi Consortium (TRC; http://www.broad.mit.edu/
rnai/trc/lib) or by Rosetta Inpharmatics, Inc., to identify
shRNAs that reproducibly depleted WRN or BLM when expressed from pLKO.1, a lentiviral expression vector containing a human U6 promoter (http://www.broad.mit.edu/
genome_bio/trc/protocols/pLKO1.noStuffer.pdf; ref. 14).
pLKO.1 shRNA vectors (Fig. 1A) were packaged by cotransfecting pLKO.1 DNA with packaging plasmid pCMV-dR8.2
dvpr and envelope plasmid pCMV-VSVG (kindly provided
by Robert Weinberg, Whitehead/MIT, Cambridge, MA) into
human 293T cells as previously described (15). Viral supernatants were filtered through a 45-μm filter and stored at
−80°C until use. shRNA-mediated depletions were performed
by transducing cells with shRNA lentivirus for 48 hours,
followed by an additional 96 hours of puromycin selection
(1.5–2.0 μg/mL). Depletions were quantified by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 1B). Controls included cells transduced with
pLKO.1 vector DNA alone or with pLKO.1 expressing a
scrambled shRNA with no known target sequence in the human genome (plasmid 1864, “scramble shRNA”; Addgene).
Codepletions were achieved by simultaneously transducing
cells with WRN- and BLM-specific shRNA lentiviruses.
Western blot analyses
Solubilized cell pellets (∼1 × 10 6 cells), prepared as
previously described (16, 17), were resolved by SDS-PAGE
(Invitrogen, Nu-PAGE) before transfer onto a polyvinylidene
difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). WRN protein was detected
with mouse monoclonal anti-WRN primary antibody 195C

Drugs and dyes
Stock solutions of cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II)
(CDDP or cis-Pt; 2 mmol/L in 0.9% NaCl), camptothecin
(CPT; 1 mmol/L in DMSO), hydroxyurea (HU; 1 mol/L
in PBS), 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 1 mg/mL in DMSO), and
5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd; 10 mmol/L in sterile water)
were stored at −20°C and diluted just before use. Propidium
iodide (10 mg/mL in PBS) was stored at 4°C in the dark,
and 4,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; 1 mg/mL) at
−20°C. DAPI was obtained from Accurate Chemical and
Scientific Corp. All other chemicals and drugs were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich.
Cell proliferation and survival assays
Population-based cell proliferation assays were performed
by plating 104 cells per well in six-well plates (9.1 cm2/well).
Duplicate wells were trypsinized and counted every 3 days.
Cell survival was quantified by colony-forming efficiency
(CFE), determined as previously described (12). In brief,
100 to 500 control cells or 4,000 to 20,000 RecQ-depleted cells

(kindly provided by Dr. Patricia Opresko, University of
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA; ref. 18). BLM protein was detected using affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal anti-BLM
antisera directed against the BLM COOH-terminal peptide
KPINRPFLKPSYAFS (additional results not shown). Human
CHK1 protein was detected with an anti-Chk1 mouse monoclonal primary antibody (Santa Cruz). Bound antibodies
were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare; Fig. 2A). Blots were scanned and quantified using a
Storm Phosphorimager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics) as previously described (16).
Flow cytometric analysis of γ-H2AX–stained cells
Genomic damage was quantified by flow cytometric
analysis of cellular γ-H2AX staining as previously described
(19). In brief, 1 × 105 to 2 × 105 cells per well were plated in
six-well plates before treatment with HU for 2 to 8 hours.
Cells were scrape-harvested, washed twice in 1× PBS, fixed
with 1-mL cold 66% ethanol/PBS, and stored at 4°C until
analyzed. Fixed cells were resuspended in TBS [25 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 137 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L KCl] supplemented with 4% FBS and 0.1% Triton X-100, incubated on ice
for 10 minutes, and stained for 1 hour with a mouse monoclonal anti–phospho-histone H2AX (Ser139) primary antibody (clone JBW301, Millipore) for 1 hour. Bound antibody
was detected by staining for 1 hour with a goat anti-mouse
Alexa 488–conjugated-secondary antibody (Molecular
Probes, A1100110C). Cells resuspended in TBS were stained
with DAPI (10 μg/mL) before flow cytometric analysis on an
Influx flow cytometer (Cytopeia, Inc.). Control cells (pLKO.1
vector only or pLKO.1 scrambled shRNA) were used to define
baseline staining set to include 1% of the cell population in
the positive cell fraction (gate 1). A second gate included all
cells while excluding cell debris (gate 2). The same gating was

6550

Cancer Res; 70(16) August 15, 2010

used for all samples within an experiment. Gate 1 versus gate
2 ratios defined the “percent γ-H2AX–positive” cells, and
“fold inductions” were calculated by dividing experimental
by control, γ-H2AX–positive cell frequencies.
Cell cycle distribution determined by BrdUrd labeling
and flow cytometry
RecQ-depleted and control cells were labeled with
50 mmol/L BrdUrd for 2 hours, then harvested as previously
described (15). BrdUrd content was determined by fixing cells
in cold 66% ethanol/PBS, denaturing in 2 N HCl/0.5% Triton
X-100 for 30 minutes each, and then neutralizing samples
with 100 mmol/L Na borate (pH 8.5). Immunostaining to
detect incorporated BrdUrd was done for 1 hour each at 4°C
in the dark with mouse anti-BrdUrd primary antibody (347580,
BD Biosciences), followed by Alexa 488–conjugated antimouse
secondary antibody (Molecular Probes A1100110C). Cells were
strained with propidium iodide (10 μg/mL) in PBS containing
100 μg/mL RNase A before analysis on an Influx flow
cytometer. Data analyses were done using Summit software
(Dako). Cell cycle fractions were estimated using FCS Express
(De Novo Software) or M-cycle (Phoenix Flow Systems).
Statistical analysis of cell proliferation, survival,
and γ-H2AX straining
Regression modeling was used as the most rigorous way to
analyze outcomes as a function of RecQ depletion type while
controlling for time, within-experiment correlations, extent
of depletion, drug, and drug dose. This approach allowed
us to analyze primary proliferation, survival, or staining data
to identify significant differences while correcting for interactions between variables and for multiple testing. Differences
were considered significant if they met a P value that was
Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing by experiment type

to preserve a family-wise type I error rate of 0.05. These
corrected P values were as follows: cell proliferation,
P = 0.012; cell survival, P = 0.00096; and γ-H2AX induction,
P = 0.007. Analyses of log cell counts and γ-H2AX straining
were fitted as a linear function of time. Data for survival of
drug-treated U-2 OS cells with fewer than 500 cells plated
were excluded from regression analysis to avoid generating
artificially high colinearity within the treated survival design
matrix. CFE outcomes were normalized to zero-dose CFE by
including the latter in the regression model. This approach
requires fewer modeling assumptions than using a “ratio of
ratios” approach (20) and thus avoids the high variability
generated when dividing by small numbers. Differences between depletion states (control, scrambled shRNA, WRN or
BLM depleted, and WRN/BLM codepleted) were tested after
adjusting for dose and experiment.

Results
Depletion of WRN and BLM from human fibroblasts
We identified two WRN-specific and three BLM-specific
shRNAs that reproducibly depleted their respective target
proteins in different cell types by ≥90%. We also identified
two additional WRN-specific and three additional BLMspecific shRNAs that partially depleted WRN or BLM by
30% to 70% (Figs. 1 and 2; additional results not shown).
Western blot analyses indicated that both WRN and BLM
were maximally depleted by day 6 after transduction and
remained depleted at ≥90% for at least 25 days (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1; refs. 13–15; additional data not shown).
Cotransduction using the same protocol and shRNA lentiviral
stocks led to simultaneous depletion of both WRN and BLM
by ≥90% (Fig. 2A).

Cell proliferation as a function of WRN/BLM
protein content
Depletion of WRN or BLM from GM639 and U-2 OS cells
suppressed cell proliferation in both population-based and
clonal proliferation assays. Higher percent depletions were
associated with stronger suppression for both WRN and
BLM. Cell proliferation was more strongly suppressed by
BLM than by WRN depletion as a function of percent depletion over the observed depletion range, and comparable
slopes were observed for regression lines that related percent
protein depletion to percent proliferative suppression in both
population-based and colony-forming assays (Fig. 3). Of note,
the proliferation of WRN/BLM-codepleted cells did not differ
from that of cells depleted of BLM alone (P = 0.34; Fig. 3;
Supplementary Fig. S2).
Genomic damage after WRN/BLM depletion
As a measure of genomic damage, we quantified both
basal and replication arrest–induced γ-H2AX levels in
WRN- and/or BLM-depleted cells. γ-H2AX is a minor histone
H2 variant that is phosphorylated on Ser139 in response to
replication stress and other types of genomic damage including DNA breakage (21, 22). The primary data presented in
Fig. 4 are means and SDs for fold γ-H2AX induction from five
independent experiments. All of these data and time points
were used to build a regression model to determine the rate
of change and whether there were differences in mean fold
γ-H2AX induction as a function of time and depletion type.
These analyses revealed significantly higher γ-H2AX inductions in all depleted cell types (WRN-depleted, BLM-depleted,
or WRN/BLM-codepleted) as compared with controls and no
significant difference in γ-H2AX induction between cells
depleted of BLM alone and WRN/BLM-codepleted cells

different (P = 0.0002), in contrast to BLM-depleted versus WRN/BLM-codepleted cells (P = 0.34). The slopes of regression lines for proliferative
suppression as a function of percent depletion were −0.20 and −0.061 log10 units of percent of control per 1% protein depleted for WRN and BLM,
respectively. B, colony formation by WRN- or BLM-depleted cells was significantly suppressed as a function of percent depletion (P = 3.9 × 10−7 for WRN
and P = 0.0016 for BLM), with significantly stronger suppression in BLM- versus WRN-depleted cells (P = 1.1 × 10−8). There was no difference
between BLM-depleted and WRN/BLM-codepleted cells in colony-forming ability (P = 0.45). Slopes of the regression lines for suppression of CFE as a
function of WRN or BLM depletion were −0.18 and −0.035 log10 units of percent of control per 1% of protein depleted, respectively.

GM639 fibroblasts and replication arrest with 2 mmol/L HU where
controls were pLKO.1 vector-only (C) or scrambled shRNA–expressing
cells (S). Regression modeling of these data revealed significantly higher
staining in WRN- and/or BLM-depleted cells versus either type of control
(C or S; P < 0.01; Supplementary Table S1) and a linear rate of change
in fold γ-H2AX induction as a function of time. BLM-depleted and
WRN/BLM-codepleted cells had significantly higher fold inductions in
staining than did WRN-depleted cells (P = 0.0016 and P = 2.8 × 10−6,
respectively) but did not differ from one another (P = 0.18; Supplementary
Table S1). There was no difference in slopes/rate of change in the
induction of H2AX staining over time as a function of depletion type
(W, B, or WB). Bars, SD for five independent experiments except for
shScr where duplicate values from a single experiment are shown.

(Supplementary Table S1). The rate of increase in γ-H2AX
staining as a function of time in HU was linear and did not
differ as a function of depleted protein(s). Differences in
γ-H2AX staining among depleted cells were not explained
by differences in cell cycle phase distribution, as assessed
by BrdUrd labeling (ref. 16; additional results not shown).
These results indicate that the depletion of WRN or BLM may
lead to genomic damage that can be detected by higher levels of
γ-H2AX staining. Comparable results were observed in U-2 OS
cells, although these were not formally analyzed as we had
fewer data than for GM639 cells (additional results not shown).
Cell survival after WRN/BLM depletion and
DNA damage
We quantified cell survival of depleted, isogenic cell lines
after treatment with four different cancer chemotherapeutic
agents: the topoisomerase I inhibitor CPT, the DNA crosslinking drug cis-Pt, the ribonucleotide reductase inhibitor
HU, and the antimetabolite and thymidylate synthase inhibitor 5-FU. Primary data from these analyses, performed as CFE
assays using GM639 or U-2 OS cells, are shown in Fig. 5. These
data were again analyzed by regression modeling to use experimental data across different doses and to correct for potential
experimental confounders and for multiple testing.
Depletion of WRN or BLM significantly sensitized GM639
and U-2 OS cells to dose-dependent killing by CPT, cis-Pt,
and 5-FU, and BLM-depleted cells to HU (Fig. 5; P = 0.31;
Table 1; see also ref. 16). Several significant differences in survival were noted between depletion type (WRN or BLM) and
by cell line. BLM-depleted GM639 cells had significantly

(W, B, or WB), agent, dose, and between-experiment variation. WRNor BLM-depleted drug-treated cells had significantly lower survival
than controls after treatment with CPT, cis-Pt, and 5-FU (P < 1 × 10−4 for
all control versus treatment comparisons). WRN-depleted GM639 cells
had significantly higher CFE than did BLM-depleted cells after CPT or
HU treatment. BLM-depleted and WRN/BLM-codepleted cells had
statistically indistinguishable survival with the exception of BLMdepleted U-2 OS versus WB-codepleted cells treated with CPT (Table 1).

WRN and BLM did not additively or synergistically sensitize
depleted cells to killing by any of the four drugs tested (Fig. 5;

Discussion
To determine how WRN and BLM influence the response
to chemotherapeutic drugs, we quantified cell proliferation,
genomic damage as assessed by γ-H2AX induction, and cell
survival after treating WRN- and/or BLM-depleted cells with
four different DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs.
Isogenic, WRN- or BLM-depleted or WRN/BLM-codepleted
TP53(+) and TP53(−) cell lines were used together with regression modeling to control for important variables including cell line, depleted protein and percent depletion, drug,
and drug dose. Codepletion analyses also allowed us to
analyze for the first time the functional redundancy of
WRN and BLM in isogenic human cell line pairs.
WRN or BLM depletion alone suppressed cell proliferation
in both TP53(+) and TP53(−) cell lines (Fig. 3) and increased
genomic damage as assessed by γ-H2AX induction both before and after HU-mediated replication arrest (Fig. 4). WRNor BLM-depleted cells were sensitized to dose-dependent
killing by CPT, cis-PT, and 5-FU (see Fig. 5 data and Table 1
statistical analysis). WRN-depleted GM639 cells had significantly higher survival after CPT or HU treatment than did
isogenic BLM-depleted cells. Of note, depletion of BLM from
WRN-depleted cells sensitized them to HU-mediated cell killing. Conversely, BLM-depleted U-2 OS cells were refractory to
CPT killing, but could be sensitized to CPT-mediated cell killing by the depletion of WRN (Fig. 5 data and Table 1 statistical analysis).
These results substantially extend and clarify our understanding of the proliferation and drug sensitivity phenotypes
of WRN- or BLM-deficient human cells. Previous work by us
and others had documented reduced proliferative potential
and DNA damage sensitivity of WRN-deficient, patientderived fibroblasts, peripheral blood lymphocytes, or
B-lymphoblastoid cell lines to cis-Pt and CPT. Other reports
had documented the selective killing of WRN-deficient cells
by 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO), mitomycin C, and
8-methoxy-psoralen + UV light using chromosomal breakage,
colony formation, or flow cytometric assays (12, 16, 23–30).
There are inconsistent reports on the HU sensitivity of
WRN-deficient cells, together with one or more reports of
no selective sensitivity of WRN-deficient, often patientderived, cells after UV damage or Adriamycin, daunomycin,
etoposide, trans-Pt, beneril, or mitoxantron treatment
(27, 31). Fewer reports have documented the drug sensitivity
of BLM-deficient cells. BLM-deficient human lymphoblast
and fibroblast cell lines were reported to be selectively killed
by UV light or HU (32) and, less consistently, by CPT (25, 33,
34). Blm-mutant mouse ES cells seem to be hypersensitive to
the intercalating agent ICRF-193 but, in contrast to BLMdeficient human cells, are mildly resistant to CPT and strongly
resistant to HU (35).
One unexpected new finding with both mechanistic and
clinical implications in our analyses was the marked 5-FU
sensitivity of both WRN- and BLM-deficient TP53(+) and
TP53(−) cells. There were few prior suggestions that this
widely used chemotherapeutic antimetabolite might selectively
kill RecQ helicase–deficient human cells. Although the mode of

Mao et al.

action of FU is still poorly understood (36, 37), loss of WRN or
BLM could promote 5-FU cell killing by interfering with DNA
replication or by inducing error-prone, homology-dependent
recombination. Both DNA replication and recombination have
different requirements for RecQ helicase function as discussed
above. It should be possible to provide additional mechanistic
insight into the 5-FU–mediated killing of WRN- or BLMdeficient cells. DNA replication could be analyzed at the single
molecule level with the methods we developed and used to
show replication defects in WRN-deficient human cells (15).
Similar approaches have also been used to show replication
defects in BLM-deficient human cells (9, 38). Recombination
defects in 5-FU–treated WRN- or BLM-deficient cells could
be quantified and analyzed at the molecular level using recombination reporter substrates of the type originally used to identify the recombination resolution defect in WRN-deficient cells
(see, e.g., ref. 12).
Our results provide a first analysis of functional redundancy
between WRN and BLM in human cells. Prior analyses of
functional redundancy had used Wrn/Blm double-mutant
mice or avian DT-40 cells. In contrast, no patient has been
identified who lacks more than one of the human RecQ
helicases. Wrn/Blm-mutant mice develop strong cellular
and organismal phenotypes that resemble Werner syndrome,
but only after ≥3 generations in a telomerase-deficient background (39, 40). These experiments thus support the idea
that WRN and BLM may act on short or disrupted telomeres
to suppress DNA damage responses, genetic instability, and
cellular senescence (41, 42). Wrn/Blm-mutant avian DT-40
cells display a proliferation defect and are hypersensitive to
CPT (43). Wrn-deficient DT-40 cells, in contrast, are only
mildly sensitive to CPT, cis-Pt, 4-NQO, and MMS (44, 45),
whereas Blm-deficient DT-40 cells have a proliferative defect
and are selectively sensitive to etoposide, bleomycin, 4-NQO,
UVC irradition, X-irradiation, and HU (46, 47).
We found that codepletion of WRN and BLM in human
cells suppressed cell proliferation, led to higher γ-H2AX
staining both before and after HU arrest (Figs. 3 and 4),
and led to dose-dependent killing of both TP53(+) or TP53
(−) cells by all four chemotherapeutic agents we tested
(Fig. 5). An important new finding in these analyses was
the lack of additive or synergistic defects in WRN/BLMcodepleted cells. This finding indicates that WRN and BLM
may act in a common pathway to suppress genomic damage
and ensure cell survival after chemotherapeutic DNA damage.
The stronger organismal and cellular phenotype observed
after loss of BLM further suggests that BLM may have a
disproportionate role in this common functional pathway
or may have additional functions that were not readily

revealed in our assays (3, 4). One prediction from this model
is that somatic cells, stem cells, and tissues from Bloom
syndrome patients will display higher levels of cell turnover,
mutagenesis, and telomere erosion than comparable cells or
tissues from Werner syndrome patients (48).
Our results provide a strong rationale for developing the
human RecQ helicases as novel cancer therapeutic biomarkers and targets. RecQ helicase mutations are uncommon
in human tumors, but epigenetic loss of expression seems
to be frequent in common adult epithelial malignancies such
as colorectal cancer (6, 7). Thus, RecQ expression profiling
could identify tumors that could be selectively killed by
widely used chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-FU, cis-Pt,
or CPT that selectively kill RecQ-deficient cells. Of note, as
shown above, these drugs selectively kill WRN- and/or
BLM-deficient cells regardless of TP53 status. Targeting
human RecQ helicases may provide a second way to improve
cancer chemotherapy. Direct inhibition of WRN or BLM
should confer a drug sensitivity profile similar to that observed in RecQ-deficient, transformed human cells. However,
this strategy in its simplest form would not confer tumorspecific cell killing in vivo. An alternative approach would
be to identify drugs or small molecules that inhibit survival
pathways required for cell viability in the absence of WRN or
BLM (49, 50). Agents that selectively killed RecQ-deficient
tumor cells might be useful as monotherapies or in conjunction with lower doses of conventional chemotherapy. Our
results and these additional approaches thus might allow
highly effective therapies to be designed for cancer patients
with RecQ helicase–deficient tumors.
