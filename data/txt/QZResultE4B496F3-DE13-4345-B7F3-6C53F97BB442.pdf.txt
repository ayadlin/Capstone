Abstract
For reasons largely unknown, Caucasian women are at a
significantly higher risk of developing breast cancer than
Asian women. Over a decade ago, mutations in BRCA1/2 were
identified as genetic risk factors; however, the discovery of
additional breast cancer genes and genes contributing to
racial disparities are lacking. We report a functional germline
mutation (polymorphism) in the galectin-3 gene at position
191 (rs4644) substituting proline with histidine (P64H), which
results in susceptibility to matrix metalloproteinase cleavage
and acquisition of resistance to drug-induced apoptosis.
This substitution correlates with incidence of breast cancer
and racial disparity. Genotype analysis of 338 Caucasian
(194 disease free and 144 breast cancer patients) and 140
Asian (79 disease free and 61 breast cancer patients) women
showed that the allele homozygous for H64 exists in disease
free Caucasian and Asian women at a frequency of 12% and
5%, respectively, versus 37% and 82% in breast cancer patients.
The data indicate that H/H allele is associated with increased
breast cancer risk in both races. The data implicate galectin-3
H64 in breast cancer and explain, in part, the noted racial
disparity, thus providing a novel target for diagnosis and
treatment. [Cancer Res 2008;68(24):10045–50]

Introduction
Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths
among women. It is estimated that in 2008, f182,460 new cases of
invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed among women in the
United States (1). Although many epidemiologic and etiologic risk
factors have been identified, the cause of any individual breast
cancer is often unknown. Breast cancer incidence and mortality
can vary tremendously with race. Population genetics studies
revealed genetic variation within racial or ethnic subpopulations,
but to what degree such genetic variability accounts for the
differences in disease outcomes is still unknown. Investigation of
the risk factors associated with racial and ethnic populations may

highlight how they might affect prevalence, severity, and responses
to treatment.
To date, numerous attempts have been made at identifying
potential breast cancer risk alleles, genetic signatures, and their
distribution across populations. However, because the identification of the two major breast cancer hereditary susceptibility genes
BRCA1 and BRCA2 that are responsible for f5% of cases, no other
obvious candidate genes contributing to a significant breast cancer
risk have been identified (2). Of note, within BRCA1 and BRCA2
carriers, broad variation in breast cancer risk exists with additional
factors contributing to breast cancer development (3). Mutations
in p53, ATM, CHEK2, PIK3CA, and overexpression of genes such
as HER-2, CCND1, and others by gene amplification have been
identified in subfractions of breast cancer cases (4, 5). A number of
recent reports have focused on single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) with the notion that such a genetic variations can/may
contribute to breast cancer development as well as other cancers
(3, 6). Genomic-wide association studies (GWAS) and intensive
bioinformatic searches of existing databases showed that nonsynonymous (ns) SNPs of a few candidate genes exhibit limited
association with breast cancer (3, 4, 6). Although a powerful
experimental tool, GWAS is not without challenges; critical to
success is the development of robust study designs, sufficient
sample sizes, rigorous phenotypes, and comprehensive maps.
Candidate gene studies conducted to date have focused mainly on
established oncogenes or genes of perceived interest, whereas
many other genes of potential significance have been overlooked.
For example, the commercially available Affymetrix Genome-Wide
Human SNP Array 6.0 features 1.8 million genetic markers, includes
>906,600 SNPs, although still missing numerous others. The Human
Hap550 chip from Illumina suffers from a similar shortcoming. One
such missing nsSNP that has not been evaluated to date is the
rs4644 in the galectin-3 gene. Galectin-3 is a member of the galectin
gene family expressing binding/specificity to h-galactoside residues
through evolutionarily conserved sequence elements of a carbohydrate recognition/binding domain and a collagen-a–like motif
cleavable by matrix metalloproteases (MMP; ref. 7). Clinical
investigations have shown a correlation between expression of
galectin-3 and the malignant properties of several types of cancer
(8); consequently, galectin-3 is thought to be a cancer-associated
protein. An allelic variation (C to A) in the DNA sequence of
galectin-3 at position 191 (rs4644), leading to the expression of
either proline (P) or histidine (H) at position 64, was previously
noted and regarded as a nontumor specific variation (9). Recently,
we have addressed the functional significance of this variation.

Cancer Research

Amino acids Ala62-Tyr63 of galectin-3 harbor the cleavage site for
MMPs (7) and substitution of the subsequent amino acid H64 with
P resulted in resistance to cleavage by MMPs (10). Introducing
galectin-3 H64 into galectin-3 null cells resulted in acquisition of
tumorigenicity and metastatic phenotype in experimental models
(11). In sharp contrast, cells transfected with galectin-3 P64 result in
reduced tumorigenicity associated with abrogated angiogenesis
and increased apoptosis, suggesting that cleavage of galectin-3
H64 by MMPs plays a role during tumor development/progression
(10). In this article, we have performed the genotype analysis of the
nsSNP (rs4644) in cancer-free and breast cancer patients, and
correlated it with the incidence of breast cancer in Caucasian and
Asian populations.

Materials and Methods
Control and patient population. The racial distribution of SNP
rs4644 in the normal population was retrieved from Ensembl release
509 (50 Caucasian and 59 Asians women), blood DNA samples from
randomly selected women from the Southeast Michigan Tri-county area
(139 Caucasian), and an additional 25 disease free volunteers (5 Caucasian
and 20 Asian). DNA samples from the breast cancer patients were
isolated from the frozen tissues of 43 Caucasian and 45 Asian (Asterand)
and 71 Caucasian and 1 Asian women (Southeast Michigan Tri-county
area). Matched DNA ( from blood, frozen normal, and cancer) from
15 Asian breast cancer patients was obtained from the Medical School
of Zhengzhou University, 10 Caucasian matched frozen cancer and
normal breast DNA were obtained from Asterand. Matched DNA from
frozen cancer, normal tissue and blood, and RNA from cancer and normal
tissue from 17 Caucasian patients were obtained from the Biospecimens
Core of the Mayo Breast Cancer Specialized Programs of Research
Excellence (SPORE). The mean age of the combined breast cancer group
was 51.7 y. In all cases, a pathologist independently confirmed the
diagnosis. DNAs were isolated using AccuPrep Genomic DNA extraction
kit (Bioneer).
PCR, sequencing, and RFLP. The following primer pair was designed to
amplify exon 3 of human galectin-3 gene Sense 5¶ CTCCATGATGCGTTATCTGGGTCTGG 3¶ Anti-sense 3¶ CCTATGGCGCCCCTGCTGGGCCACTG 5¶.
The target sequence was amplified using Eppendorf Thermal Cycler by
QIAGEN Fast Cycling PCR. The resulting 324 bp DNA fragment was
purified using QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen), visualized on 1%
agarose gel containing Syto 60 stain, scanned by Odyssey IR imaging
system (LI-COR Biosciences), and sequenced using the sense primer at
Applied Genomics Technology Center, Core facility at Wayne State
University and Karmanos Cancer Institute. PCR-based RFLP was
performed by digestion of the PCR product with NcoI (Invitrogen
Corporation) as an additional method to confirm the genotype. Both
experiments were performed in a blinded manner by two investigators
independently on two different dates. To verify that the DNA samples
were not cross-contaminated, the entire length of each PCR product was
sequenced and distribution of a different nsSNP in exon 3 was observed,
implying no cross-contamination.
Cell lines and antibodies. The human breast cancer cell lines SK-BR-3,
MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, normal fibroblast cells IMR90,
and HS68 were maintained in McCoy medium (Invitrogen Corporation)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Atlanta Biologicals).
Normal breast cell line MCF10A was maintained in DMEM F-12 medium
(Invitrogen Corporation) with 0.1 Ag/mL cholera toxin, 10 Ag/mL insulin,
0.5 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 0.02 Ag/mL epidermal growth factor, and 5%
horse serum (Sigma-Aldrich Inc.). BT-549 and its stably transfected cell
clones, BT-549 Gal-3 H64, BT-549 Gal-3 P64, were maintained in Dulbecco’s
Minimal Essential Medium (Invitrogen Corporation) containing 10% FBS,

essential and nonessential amino acids (Invitrogen), vitamins and antibiotics
(Mediatech Cellgro, Inc.), SUM-102, SUM-149, and SUM 1,315 were
maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 5 Ag/mL
insulin, and 1 Ag/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.). All cell lines were
grown in 5% CO2 incubator at 37jC. Cells were grown to 80% confluence and
genomic DNA was extracted using AccuPrep Genomic DNA extraction kit
(Bioneer). Anti-poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), mouse monoclonal
antibody was purchased from BioMol. Monoclonal anti–h-actin (clone AC15) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Hybridoma expressing galectin-3
monoclonal antibody TIB-166 was purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. The polyclonal antibody against galectin-3 was prepared as
described (11).
Cell viability and apoptosis. BT-549, BT-549 Gal-3 H64, and BT-549
Gal-3 P64 cells were seeded at a density of 2,500 cells per well in
triplicates onto 24-well culture dishes. In one set of wells, 25 Amol/L
cisplatin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc.) was added after 24 h of seeding, the
other nontreated set served as control. Cell viability was determined
after 72 h by the mitochondrial-dependent reduction of 3-(4,
5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT; SigmaAldrich, Inc.) to formazan.
To determine if cell death is due to apoptosis, 1  106 cells were seeded
in 100-mm Petri dishes and treated similarly with cisplatin. After 24, 48,
and 72 h, the cells were trypsinized, lysed, and equivalent number of cells
(1  105) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with a
1:200 dilution of PARP mouse monoclonal antibody (BioMol). Blots were
also immunoreacted with a 1:5,000 dilution of anti–h-actin mouse
monoclonal antibody to normalize for variation in protein loading. After
washes, the blots were reacted with secondary antibody mix containing
1:5,000 dilutions of IR Dye 680 or IR Dye 800 conjugated corresponding
antibody (Molecular Probes) and scanned by Odyssey IR imaging system to
identify the respective proteins.
Immunohistochemical analysis. A breast cancer progression tissue
array (BR480) containing 48 tissue cores of 2-mm size was purchased from
U.S. Biomax. Four-micrometer serial sections were deparafinized, rehydrated, blocked, and incubated with primary antibodies (anti–galectin-3
monoclonal, anti–galectin-3 polyclonal) at 4jC overnight at the suitable
dilution and linked with the appropriate host secondary antibodies
(Vector Laboratories) tagged with Avidin biotinylated horseradish
peroxidase, colorized with 3¶-3¶-diaminobenzidine, and counterstained
with hematoxylin. Visualization and documentation were accomplished
with an OLYMPUS BX40 microscope supporting a Sony DXC-979MD
3CCCD video camera and stored with the M5+ microcomputer imaging
device (Interfocus).
Statistical analysis. The assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in
the control groups was evaluated using Fisher exact tests. Odds ratios (OR)
were used to estimate the magnitude of the association of breast cancer
with the alleles HH and HP. Cornfield’s method was used to estimate 95%
confidence intervals (CI). If there was no evidence of heterogeneity in the
ORs based on Tarone’s test, the Mantel-Haenszel combined OR was
calculated to estimate the overall OR across ethnic groups. Two-sided
P values are reported. Calculations were made with Stata SE 10.2.
The assumption of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was found to be tenable in
both the Asian control group (P = 0.12) and the Caucasian control group
(P = 0.44). The Biostatistics Core of the Karmanos Cancer Institute performed
statistical analysis. Microsoft Excel software was used for calculating
statistical significance of apoptosis assay by two sample t test: using unequal
variance. P values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant.

Results and Discussion
To examine the possibility that the P64H substitution contributes to breast cancer, we initially screened a panel of commonly
used human breast cancer cell lines, analyzed their galectin-3
genomic sequence, and compared it with their reported experimental tumorigenicity in nude mice. The normal human breast
epithelial cell line (MCF10A) was found to be homozygous for the P
allele similar to normal human fibroblast cells (HS68 and IMR90).

Galectin-3 nsSNP and Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer

Two breast carcinoma cell lines BT-549 and SK-BR-3 (11) that are
galectin-3 null and exhibited none to very low tumorigenicity in
experimental models were homozygous for P allele at DNA level,
whereas the tumorigenic human breast carcinoma cell lines,
MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-435, SUM 149, SUM 1315, and SUM 102
were homozygous for the H allele and the MDA-MB-468 (12, 13)
was heterozygous carrying both alleles (Fig. 1A). Thus, we
hypothesized that in these cell lines galectin-3 P64 and galectin-3
H64 could be associated with normal and tumor phenotypes,
respectively. Next, we questioned whether this genotype variation is
human specific or is evolutionarily conserved. Homology search of
galectin-3 from chicken to mammals revealed that appearance of
H64 variant is relatively late occurrence in evolution and found only
in humans (Fig. 1B).
Genomic DNAs from healthy women were isolated from two
control studies: one, random digit dialing, the other, volunteers. The
data independently obtained from sequencing and RFLP analysis
revealed that 64% of the cancer-free Caucasian women were either
homozygous (12%) or heterozygous (52%) for H64 and the remaining
36% were homozygous for P64. In contrast, 70% of the cancer-free
control Asian women were homozygous for P64, the remaining 30%
carried at least one H64 allele, 5% of which were homozygous and
25% were heterozygous (Fig. 2A). This racial difference of genotype
distribution is in accordance with the data retrieved from available
databases (Ensembl release 50; Fig. 2B).
The National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
End Results (SEER) data indicated that Caucasian women have
f1.5 times higher propensity to develop breast cancer compared

with Asian women (Fig. 2B, inset). Genotype distribution of rs4644
in Caucasian and Asian breast cancer patients showed that 70%
and 97% of the tumor samples from Caucasians and Asians,
respectively, harbor the H64 allele, of which 37% of the Caucasians
and 82% of the Asians were homozygous (Supplementary Data
Table S1; Fig. 3A).
Kienan and colleagues (14) have recently reported that Asian and
European ancestors shared the same population bottleneck
expanding out of Africa, but that both also experienced a more
recent genetic drift, which was greater in Asians. We presume that
this genetic drift led in part to an enrichment in the Asian
population of P genotype due to evolutionary selection. Breast
cancer is a complex disease, consisting of diverse structures,
genetic, epigenetic variations, and clinical outcomes. Genetic
linkage studies have not identified a significant number of breast

genotyping was performed in RNA and/or DNA isolated from
cancer tissue, surrounding normal tissue and blood of Caucasian
and Asian breast cancer patients (Supplementary Table S2). The
genotype distribution of rs4644 from these samples was analyzed

gene. 324-bp amplified DNA was digested with NcoI and the resulting fragments

PCR product containing the H allele can be digested by NcoI creating two
fragments of 171 and 153 bp length (lanes H/H and H/P ). Sequencing of
the galectin-3 gene around the C191A site was performed in Applied
Genomics Technology Center using the sense primer (inset, DNA sequence
chromatograms indicating allelic variation). The OR of breast cancer for the
H/H genotype compared with the P/P genotype for Caucasian and Asian patients
were 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–4.9; P = 0.001 and 94.6; 95% CI, 10.0–892.4; P < 0.001,
respectively.

cancer-causing genes other than BRCA1/2 (15). This lack of
identifiable susceptibility genes suggests that breast cancer is most
probably conferred by a large number of loci, each contributing in a
small additive manner to the overall breast cancer risk (4). In
addition, variation in risk for breast cancer has been attributed in
part to diet, local environmental factors, and/or yet to be identified
genetic predisposing factors. Thus, to date, the majority of clinical
cases lack identifiable risk factor(s) other than gender, age, race, and
family history. The differences in the propensity to develop breast
cancer are likely attributable to multiple genes/factors, and the data
presented here suggest that the reported H64 and P64 allelic
variation may contribute, in part, to the racial disparity observed
between Caucasian and Asian women in the incidence of breast
cancer. There are statistically significant differences in the odds of
breast cancer for the H/H genotype compared with the P/P
genotype for Caucasian and Asian patients (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4–4.9;
P = 0.001; and OR, 94.6; 95% CI, 10.0–892.4; P < 0.001, respectively).
To establish whether this tumor-specific genotype reflects a
somatic or germline change and/or loss of heterozygosity,

Galectin-3 nsSNP and Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer

using two independent methods: DNA sequencing and PCR-based
RFLP (Fig. 3B). The data illustrated that the genotype of the normal
DNA as well as RNA when available (both from blood and normal
tissue) matched the genotype in tumor tissue, implying that this
genetic variation was germline.
Galectin-3 has been implicated with the progression and
metastasis of several types of cancers by affecting cell growth,
differentiation, transformation, angiogenesis, immune response,
and apoptosis (16). Although most of these functions are positively
influenced by galectin-3, it may act as a double-edged sword either
protecting against or stimulating cell death. Overexpression of the
galectin-3 H64 variant resulted in resistance to cisplatin-induced
apoptosis in transfected BT-549 breast cancer cells (17). Of note,
the secreted form could lead to apoptosis of tumor infiltrating
T cells leading to the evasion of cancer cells from the host immune
system, which is regulated in part by a functional crosstalk between
intracellular and extracellular galectins (18). To investigate the
possible functional significance of this allelic variation, we used
BT-549, a galectin-3 null cell line, to generate cell clones stably
overexpressing either galectin-3 P64 or H64 variant allele (10).
BT-549 cell clones harboring either H64 or P64 allele were treated
with cisplatin. A dose- and time-dependent decrease in the number
of viable cells was observed. Cells expressing the H64 galectin-3
variant were resistant to apoptosis with only 36.2% F 2.2%
apoptotic cells, whereas the parental and P64 cell clones were highly
susceptible to drug induced apoptosis with 76.5% F 1.34% and
71.5% F 3.02%, respectively (Fig. 4I). That the cell death was due to
apoptosis was confirmed by the cleavage of PARP. Figure 3B
indicates that parental and galectin-3 P64 expressing cells showed
the 85 kDa cleaved polypeptide of PARP, whereas galectin-3 H64
cells were refractive to PARP cleavage.
The biological functions regulated by galectin-3 include mRNA
splicing, cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis resistance, whereas
secreted galectin-3 modulates cellular adhesion and signaling,
immune response, angiogenesis, and tumorigenesis by binding to
cell surface glycoconjugates such as laminin, fibronectin, and
collagen IV (16). The functions regulated by secreted galectin-3
such as angiogenesis and tumor growth were inhibited only in BT549 cell clones harboring the MMP cleavage–resistant galectin-3
P64 variant (10).
An important role for galectin-3 in breast cancer progression has
been suggested because it was found to be significantly elevated in
the sera of breast cancer patients compared with healthy controls
(19). Furthermore, galectin-3 localizes in cells proximal to the
stroma in comedo-ductal carcinoma in situ, which could lead to
increased invasive potential by inducing interactions with the
stromal counterparts (20). Secreted galectin-3 H64 binds to the

endothelial cells of the microvessels and induces migration,
morphogenesis, and angiogenesis (21). The cleaved galectin-3
H64 bound to the endothelial cell surface with higher affinity (f20
times) than the full-length protein in a carbohydrate-dependent
manner, and the MMPs cleavage resistant galectin-3 P64 did not
mimic galectin-3 H64 functions (10). Of note, in vivo cleavage of
galectin-3 was found to be a surrogate marker for the activity of
MMPs in the growing breast cancer (10). Thus, we examined here,
whether and at what progressive stage this cleavage of galectin-3
could be detected in breast cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis
of a breast cancer progression tissue array with specific antibodies
to detect intact (Fig. 4III A–C) and cleaved galectin-3 (Fig. 4III A‘-C’)
revealed that in the normal breast tissue (A–A’), no cleavage of
galectin-3 could be detected. In ductal hyperplasia, the intact
protein could be detected on the tubular side of the ducts, whereas
the cleaved protein could be detected adjacent to the stroma
(B–B’). In the infiltrating lobular carcinoma, most of the invasive
cell clusters were positive for the cleaved product (C–C’). These
results emphasize the significance of P64H mutation in breast
cancer progression and highlight the role of MMPs in this process.
Because galectin-3 is not a classic oncogene but rather a cancer
helper gene product, we suggest that it most probably exerts its
function during the progression stage, i.e., after cancer initiation
and promotion by other genes/factors. Future larger scale studies
will be required to determine which allele is dominant in an H/P
heterozygote and whether this affects breast cancer development.
In conclusion, we provide novel data implicating a galectin-3
germline nonsynonymous polymorphism in breast cancer and note
that variation in allelic frequencies for this nsSNP between
Caucasian and Asian women in the general population may
explain, in part, the evolutionary differential incidence of breast
cancer observed in the two races.
