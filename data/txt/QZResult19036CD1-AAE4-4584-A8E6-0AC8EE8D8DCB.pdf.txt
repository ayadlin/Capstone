BACKGROUND: Current research is inconclusive regarding the relation between alcohol consumption
and prostate cancer risk. In this study, the authors examined the associations of total alcohol, type of alcoholic beverage, and drinking pattern with the risk of total, low-grade, and high-grade prostate cancer.
METHODS: Data for this study came from the 2129 participants in the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial
(PCPT) who had cancer detected during the 7-year trial and 8791 men who were determined by biopsy to
be free of cancer at the trial end. Poisson regression was used to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations of alcohol intake with prostate cancer risk. RESULTS: Associations of drinking with high-grade disease did not differ by treatment arm. In combined arms, heavy alcohol consumption (50 g of alcohol daily) and regular heavy drinking (4 drinks daily on 5 days per
week) were associated with increased risks of high-grade prostate cancer (RR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.33-3.05] and
2.17 [95% CI, 1.42-3.30], respectively); less heavy drinking was not associated with risk. Associations of
drinking with low-grade cancer differed by treatment arm. In the placebo arm, there was no association of
drinking with risk of low-grade cancer. In the finasteride arm, drinking 50 g of alcohol daily was associated with an increased risk of low-grade disease (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.39-2.56); this finding was because of a
43% reduction in the risk of low-grade cancer attributable to finasteride treatment in men who drank <50g
of alcohol daily and the lack of an effect of finasteride in men who drank 50 g of alcohol daily (Pinteraction

Whether alcohol affects prostate cancer risk is uncertain. Most studies have reported no significant
associations,1-7 although 2 meta-analyses reported an approximate 20% increase in risk among heavy
drinkers.2,4 Among the studies that have reported significant associations, there is little consistency in the
effect size or direction, pattern of dose-response, or associations specific to type of alcoholic beverage, clinical stage, or pathologic grade.8-16 Studies that can clarify the association of alcohol consumption with

prostate cancer risk are important, because, beyond
obesity,17 smoking,18-21 and perhaps diet,18,22,23 prostate
cancer has no well established, modifiable risk factors.
In this article, we report results on the association of
alcohol consumption and risk of prostate cancer from the
Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT). We examined
the relations of total alcohol consumption, alcohol from
different types of beverages, and usual drinking pattern
with the risks of total, low-grade, and high-grade prostate
cancer. We also examined whether the effects of finasteride (the PCPT study drug) were modified by alcohol
consumption, because both affect the metabolism of
testosterone.24,25 Results of this study address whether
alcohol consumption is associated with risks of biopsydetected presence or absence of local stage prostate cancer
and whether alcohol consumption should be considered
when making clinical recommendations for the use of
finasteride for prostate cancer prevention.

as low-grade (Gleason sum, 2-6) or high-grade (Gleason
sum, 7-10) prostate cancer.
Of 18,880 participants, we excluded 7539 men
(39.9%) who did not have an end-of-study biopsy, which
included 1393 men who died, 6141 men who were medically unable or refused, and 5 men who underwent prostatectomy for reasons other than cancer, leaving 2400 cases and
8941 noncases. Next, we excluded 173 men who were diagnosed after the trial end date (June 23, 2003), 90 men who
were diagnosed 180 days after their planned end-of-study
visit, and 99 men (noncases) whose end-of-study biopsy was
completed 180 days before their end-of-study visit. From
the 10,979 men remaining for study, we also excluded 59
men who had incomplete or missing questionnaire data on
any of the following factors: alcohol consumption (n ¼ 4),
current smoking status (n ¼ 5), physical activity (n ¼ 48),
education (n ¼ 1), and both education and physical activity
(n ¼ 1), which left 10,920 men for the current analyses.
Data Collection

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Study Population
All data for this study were collected as part of the PCPT,
a randomized, placebo-controlled trial testing whether
finasteride, a 5a-reductase inhibitor, could reduce the 7year period prevalence of prostate cancer. Informed consent was obtained from each participant before the study.
Details of the study design and participant characteristics
have been described previously.26 Briefly, in total, 18,880
men aged 55 years with a normal digital rectal examination (DRE) and a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level
3.0 ng/mL were randomized to receive either finasteride
(5 mg daily) or placebo. During the PCPT, men underwent DRE and PSA determinations annually, and a prostate biopsy was recommended for participants who had an
abnormal DRE or a PSA 4.0 ng/mL. At the final study
visit in Year 7, all men who had not previously been diagnosed with prostate cancer were offered an end-of-study
biopsy. All biopsies were collected under transrectal ultrasonographic guidance and involved a minimum of 6
specimens (cores). All biopsies were reviewed to confirm
the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma both by the pathologist
at the local study site and by a central pathology laboratory. Tumors were graded centrally and were categorized
3662

Details regarding age, race, education, diabetes status, family history of prostate cancer in first-degree relatives, physical
activity, history of smoking, and usual alcohol consumption
were collected at baseline using self-administered questionnaires. Participants reported the frequency of consuming
each type of beverage (beer, wine, and liquor) over the past
year in 7 categories (never, 1 day per month, 2-3 days per
month, 1-2 days per week, 3-4 days per week, 5-6 days per
week, or every day). They reported the usual number of
drinks on each drinking day and the usual size of each drink
(small, medium, or large, treated as 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5, respectively, in our analyses). We calculated the number of standard servings per week for each type of alcoholic beverage by
multiplying the days of drinking per week by number of
drinks per drinking day and serving size. Standard servings
were converted into grams of ethanol (beer, 12.96 g; wine,
12.35 g; and liquor, 13.93 g), and these were summed to
obtain total alcohol intake in grams per week. Daily average
grams of alcohol were categorized as 0 g, 0.1 g to <3 g, 3 g
to <15 g, 15 g to <30 g, 30 g to <50 g, and 50 g.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants.

grade prostate cancer while controlling for covariates. We
used Poisson regression with a robust error variance, a
modified Poisson regression approach proposed by
Zou,27 to calculate relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Regressions were completed
using the SAS GENMOD procedure with the Log-link
function, and the robust error variances were estimated by
using a repeated statement and the subject identifier as the
class variable.27 Results are given adjusted for age (ages
<60 years, 60-69 years, and 70 years), race (white, African American, and other) and body mass index (BMI)
(<25 kg/m2, 25-29.9 kg/m2, and 30 kg/m2). Further
control for education, diabetes, smoking, family history of
prostate cancer, physical activity, and baseline PSA level
(<1 ng/mL, 1-1.9 ng/mL, and 2 ng/mL) did not affect
the results. In the analyses of a specific type of alcoholic beverage, other types of alcoholic beverages were included as
covariates. Tests for linear trend across categories were based
on an ordinal variable corresponding to rank from lowest to
highest category, as described by Breslow and Day.28
Drinking pattern was defined as the number of days
per week on which men drank alcoholic beverages (<1
day, 1-4 days, and 5 days) stratified by the number of
drinks per drinking day (1-3 drinks or 4 drinks). This
distinguished men who drank heavily on a few days from
those who drank modestly on many days.
Primary analyses were completed in each treatment
arm separately. When there were no differences between
arms, post hoc analyses are given for both study arms
combined. We also examined whether the effect of finasteride was modified by level of alcohol consumption. All
statistical tests were 2-sided and were considered statistically significant when P < .05. Statistical analyses were
conducted using SAS software (version 9.1; SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC).

RESULTS
Among the total 10,920 men in this analysis, 2129 men
(19.5%) were diagnosed with prostate cancer, including
1425 men (66.9%) with Gleason scores from 2 to 6, 564
men (26.5%) with Gleason scores 7, and 140 men
(6.5%) with unknown Gleason scores. With regard to tumor classification (T), of 2129 cases, 1515 (71.2%) were
stage T1, 505 (23.7%) were stage T2, 37 (1.7%) were
stage T3, and 72 (3.4%) were of unknown stage. Younger

age, white race, advanced education, no diabetes, a BMI
<30 kg/m2, smoking, and physical inactivity all were
associated with higher alcohol consumption (Table 1).
Other strong predictors of prostate cancer risk in this
cohort, including PSA at baseline, finasteride treatment,
and family history of prostate cancer, were not associated
with alcohol consumption.
Only heavy drinking (50 g of alcohol per day) was
associated with cancer risk, and there was no doseresponse at lower levels of alcohol intake (Table 2). In the
placebo arm, heavy alcohol intake was not associated with
risk of total or low-grade cancer but was associated with a
nonsignificant 67% increase in the risk of high-grade cancer. In the finasteride arm, heavy drinking was associated
with a 89% increased risk of total cancer, a 101%
increased risk for low-grade cancer, and a 115% increased
risk of high-grade cancer (all P < .01). In a post hoc analysis, the RR for high-grade cancer associated with heavy
drinking in the combined study arms was 2.01 (95% CI,
1.33-3.05; P ¼ .009).
Table 3 shows associations of specific types of alcoholic beverages with prostate cancer risk. Heavy beer consumption was associated with a significant and large
increased risk of high-grade cancer in both study arms; the
RR for high-grade cancer contrasting no intake to heavy
beer intake in the combined arms was 2.89 (95% CI,
1.76-4.76; P < .0001). In the placebo arm, heavy wine
consumption was associated with a 79% increased risk of
low-grade cancer (P ¼ .03); whereas, in the finasteride
arm, heavy beer drinking was associated with a 103%
increased risk of low-grade cancer (P < .0001). There
were no significant associations of liquor with cancer risk.
Occasional heavy drinking (4 drinks per day on
<5 days per week) was not associated with cancer risk
(data not shown). Heavy drinking on 5 days per week,
compared with not drinking, was associated with a significantly increased risk of high-grade cancer in both the placebo arm (RR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.04-4.04 [P ¼ .04]) and
the finasteride arm (RR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.31-3.86 [P ¼
.003]). In the combined arms, the RR was 2.17 (95% CI,
1.42-3.30; P ¼ .0003).
Table 4 presents the effects of finasteride treatment
in the risk of prostate cancer by levels of alcohol consumption. We dichotomized alcohol intake into <50 g daily
versus 50 g daily based on results in Table 2 and noted
that the effects of finasteride were similar across all levels

DISCUSSION
In this large cohort of men with biopsy-determined presence or absence of prostate cancer, heavy alcohol consumption (50 g per day) was associated with a 101%
increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer. Heavy beer
drinking was associated independently with a 189%
increased risk of high-grade cancer; because of lower consumption, the independent associations with heavy wine
and liquor consumption could not be evaluated rigorously. The pattern of occasional heavy drinking (4
drinks per day on <5 days per week) was not associated
with the risk of cancer, but heavy drinking on 5 days per
week was associated with a 117% increased risk of highgrade cancer. Finally, there was a significant interaction
between heavy alcohol consumption and finasteride treatment for low-grade cancer. Finasteride reduced the risk of
low-grade cancer by 43% in men who drank <50 g of
alcohol per day, but finasteride had no effect in heavy
drinkers.
Overall, our results are consistent with findings
from 2 meta-analyses and 1 review concluding that lightCancer

to-moderate alcohol consumption is not associated with
the risk of prostate cancer.1,2,4 Our findings on heavy
drinking and, in particular, its association with the risk
only for high-grade cancer are not consistent with relevant
published studies. For comparison, we examined the 6
studies with alcohol intake categories that were at least as
high as our heavy drinking category (4 drinks per
day)3,5,29-32 plus an additional 4 studies in which the
highest alcohol intake category was at least as high as 2
drinks per day.8,14,16,33 Of those 10 studies, 2 reported an
RR <0.80,5,8 and 1 reported an RR >1.2031 associated
with heavy drinking; statistically significant RRs were limited to 0.23 (95% CI, 0.06-0.95) associated with 22
drinks per week (based on 2 cases)8 and 1.4 (95%CI, 1.01.8) and 1.9 (95% CI, 1.3-2.7) associated with 22 to 56
drinks per week and 57 drinks per week (based on 211
cases and 96 cases),31 respectively. Furthermore, there
were no differences in findings by measures of tumor
aggressiveness in studies that conducted stratified analyses.3,14,16,31,32 Several of those studies were small, used
case-control designs, or did not comprehensively assess

usual alcohol intake, but the inconsistency of the current
study with results from other large and well conducted
studies is difficult to explain. It is possible that other studies were affected by a PSA detection bias, which would
mask an association if heavy drinkers were less likely to get
PSA screening.34 It is also possible that the characteristics
of cancer cases in the PCPT, nearly all of which were
3666

screen-detected and local stage, could have affected our
findings, for example, if heavy alcohol consumption
reduced prostate size or modified the appearance of small,
intermediate-grade cancers. The mean prostate volume
was smaller in heavy drinkers compared with others (25.7
mL vs 28.0 mL; P ¼ .04), but this magnitude of difference
is not likely to affect disease detection substantially.

Clearly, the replication of these findings and an investigation into potential biases affecting studies of alcohol and
prostate cancer are needed.
Among the different types of alcoholic beverages,
only heavy beer consumption was associated consistently
with prostate cancer risk. Results of previous studies
examining types of alcoholic beverages and prostate
cancer risk have been inconsistent.3,5-7,9-16,35-37 Most
reported no differences in prostate cancer risk between
different types of alcoholic beverages3,5-7,11-13; some studies reported higher risks associated with beer consumption,9,36 and others reported higher risks associated with
liquor consumption.10,37 Whether beer is uniquely associated with the risk of prostate cancer is uncertain. Few
studies, including ours, had enough heavy liquor or wine
consumers to detect a unique effect, and it is possible that
the unique effects of beer are attributable to its high consumption relative to other alcoholic beverages. The effects
of wine also may be masked because of differences
between red and white wines3,12,35; however, we lacked
data to address this question.
Only 2 studies have examined associations of patterns of heavy drinking with the risk of prostate cancer.
One reported an increased risk (RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.132.38) among men who drank large amounts of alcohol
(105 g per week) on 1 or 2 days per week but no risk
when men drank a similar daily amount on average (50
g daily) every day of the week.13 A second study reported
a nonsignificant trend for increasing risk among men who
drank 140 g per week when spread over a few days of

the week (RR for 7 days, 4-6 days, and 1-3 days: 1.00,
1.20, and 1.56, respectively), but no increased risk was
associated with drinking a similar daily amount on average (60 g daily) every day of the week.3 We observed no
evidence that drinking 4 drinks daily on <5 days per
week was associated with cancer risk. It is difficult to
hypothesize a mechanism whereby occasional drinking,
but not regular heavy drinking, would increase cancer
risk; and findings in previous studies, which were based
on very small numbers, may have been because of chance.
Indeed, binge drinking is rare in middle-aged and older
men38 and is rarer still in the men who participate in most
research studies; much larger studies with detailed alcohol
assessment will be needed to address this association in the
future. On the basis of current evidence, there appears to
be no association between occasional heavy drinking and
the risk of prostate cancer.
There are several mechanisms whereby alcohol consumption may influence prostate carcinogenesis. Alcohol
itself may be carcinogenic.39 It affects the metabolism of
carcinogens and suppresses DNA repair40,41; it may
increase DNA damage because of oxidative stress42,43;
and, at high levels, it impairs immune response and
increases the risk of micronutrient deficiencies.44 Unlike
the digestive tract and liver, which have characteristics
that make them uniquely susceptible to 1 or more of these
effects of alcohol, we know of no such characteristics of
the prostate. Planned future analyses of circulating steroid
hormones, genetic characteristics, markers of oxidative
stress, and prostate tissue pathology in the PCPT may
3667

better elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of
alcohol reported here.
The observation that finasteride did not reduce the
risk of low-grade cancer among heavy drinkers is notable.
In the sample of PCPT participants that we used in these
analyses, finasteride treatment decreased the risk of total
and low-grade prostate cancer by 28% (95% CI, 33%22%) and 42% (95% CI, 47%-36%), respectively, and it
increased the risk of high-grade cancer by 22% (95% CI,
4%-43%). Our results suggest that finasteride will not
lower prostate cancer risk among men who are heavy
drinkers. This finding is not because of poor adherence,
because compliance based on pill counts was 66% in both
heavy drinkers and nonheavy drinkers. Several mechanisms are plausible: Alcohol induces the expression of 5areductase (the action of finasteride is through competitive
inhibition of 5a-reductase),45 and it affects enzyme
expression and oxidative stress in the liver (in which finasteride primarily is metabolized).46 Future studies in the
PCPT will examine whether heavy drinking affects finasteride metabolism or finasteride induces changes in steroid hormone metabolism.
Our study had several strengths. First, all men had
biopsy-proven absence or presence of prostate cancer, and
this minimized the potential misclassification bias. Second, alcohol intake was assessed using a detailed questionnaire and not with a food frequency questionnaire,
allowing us to examine the effects of specific types of alcoholic beverages as well as heavy or binge drinking patterns.
Third, all men were screened for prostate cancer by both
PSA level and DRE during the study period, which eliminated any potential bias from PSA screening. This study
also had several limitations. The number of men who
were heavy drinkers was modest; and, when the results
were stratified by study arm and cancer grade, the statistical power was limited. Data on alcohol consumption were
available only for the year preceding study entry. Finally,
because almost all cases of prostate cancer were screen
detected, we could not examine associations with regional
or distant stage disease.
In summary, we observed that heavy drinking was
associated with an increased risk of high-grade, screendetected prostate cancer. This finding is somewhat unique
in the literature and requires replication; however, physicians may choose to consider this finding when counseling
men on reducing their risk of prostate cancer. We also
3668

observed that heavy drinkers did not benefit from finasteride treatment. It would be prudent for physicians who are
recommending finasteride for prostate cancer prevention
to assess their patients’ alcohol consumption and recommend drinking no more than 2 or 3 drinks per day.
