Abstract
RNA polymerase I (Pol I)-mediated transcription of the ribosomal RNA genes
(rDNA) is confined to the nucleolus and is a rate-limiting step for cell growth and
proliferation. Inhibition of Pol I by CX-5461 can selectively induce p53-mediated
apoptosis of tumour cells in vivo. Currently, CX-5461 is in clinical trial for patients
with advanced haematological malignancies (Peter Mac, Melbourne).
Here we demonstrate that CX-5461 also induces p53-independent cell cycle
checkpoints mediated by ATM/ATR signaling in the absence of DNA damage. Further,
our data demonstrate that the combination of drugs targeting ATM/ATR signaling
and CX-5461 leads to enhanced therapeutic benefit in treating p53-null tumours
in vivo, which are normally refractory to each drug alone. Mechanistically, we show
that CX-5461 induces an unusual chromatin structure in which transcriptionally
competent relaxed rDNA repeats are devoid of transcribing Pol I leading to activation
of ATM signaling within the nucleoli. Thus, we propose that acute inhibition of Pol
transcription initiation by CX-5461 induces a novel nucleolar stress response that can
be targeted to improve therapeutic efficacy.

Introduction

and Ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase
pathway in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [33, 34]. In
this paper, we extend these findings by examining the
mechanisms underlying the p53-independent cellular
response to Pol I transcription inhibition by CX-5461 to
further understand its potential to target solid tumours
and to identify targets for rational combination therapies
to improve the therapeutic efficacy of targeting Pol I
transcription.
We used primary immortalized human fibroblasts
(BJ-T) and BJ-T cells stably expressing a short hairpin RNA
(shRNA) targeting p53 (BJ-T p53sh), to examine in detail,
the biological consequences of inhibiting Pol I transcription
initiation in primary cells lacking functional p53.
Both BJ-T and BJ-T p53sh cell lines undergo a G1
and G2 cell cycle arrest and senescence in response to
CX-5461 treatment. We demonstrate that CX-5461
activates ATM and ATR kinase signaling in the absence of
global DNA damage. We further demonstrate that inhibition
of ATM/ATR-mediated cell cycle arrest leads BJ-T p53sh
and an isogenic RAS and SV40-transformed cell line
(BJ-LSTR) to undergo mitotic catastrophe and subsequent
CX-5461-mediated cell death in vitro and improves the
therapeutic efficacy of CX-5461 in targeting aggressive
Tp53-null (Tp53−/−) MYC-driven lymphomas in vivo.
Active rRNA genes are among the most highly
transcribed genes in the genome and are normally
characterized by high Pol I loading density [35].
Mechanistically, our data demonstrate that CX-5461
prevents Pol I loading on the rDNA leading to abnormal
open and accessible rDNA repeats devoid of Pol I, which
is associated with activation of ATM signaling within the
nucleoli in the absence of DNA damage. We therefore
propose that perturbations of rDNA chromatin trigger
a previously unrecognised nucleolar stress response
that activates a non-canonical DDR. Importantly, the
combination of CX-5461 and inhibition of DDR leads to
enhanced therapeutic efficacy in treating an aggressive
Tp53-null Eµ-Myc lymphoma in vivo.

Transcription of rDNA by RNA polymerase I (Pol I)
underpins the structure of the nucleoli, which form
around active clusters of rDNA termed nucleolar
organizer regions (NORs). The nucleolus coordinates
the monitoring and maintenance of ribosome biogenesis,
which is tightly linked to nucleolar structure and integrity
[1–4]. However, the primary function of the nucleoli
is not limited to the production of ribosomal subunits.
Bioinformatic analysis of the nucleolar proteome revealed
that fewer than half of the 4500 nucleolar proteins are
involved in ribosome biogenesis, while the rest include
factors associated with mRNA metabolism, chromatin
structure, cell cycle control, DNA replication and repair
[5, 6]. The nucleolus indirectly, through sequestration and
release of these proteins, has the potential to modulate a
diverse range of cellular functions including regulation
of tumor suppressor and proto-oncogene activities, cellcycle control and the DNA damage response (DDR).
Furthermore, the nucleolar proteome is dynamically
altered in response to nutrient/growth factor signaling and
stress responses (reviewed in [7–10]).
The nucleolus is the ‘gatekeeper’ of the nucleolar
surveillance pathway, also known as the nucleolar stress
pathway [1, 2, 4, 8, 11–13]. The canonical nucleolar stress
pathway is induced following acute insults that inhibit
ribosome biogenesis and is associated with accumulation
of the tumour suppressor protein p53, which mediates
cell cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis depending on
the cellular context [14–21]. Therapeutic targeting of p53
through perturbation of ribosome biogenesis is thought
to be a mechanism utilized by many cancer therapeutic
drugs [22, 23]. Furthermore, we have shown that selective
inhibition of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene transcription is
a new potential paradigm for cancer therapy and a specific
small molecule inhibitor of Pol I transcription initiation
(CX-5461) has progressed to clinical trial [10, 21, 24–29].
Indeed, we previously demonstrated that CX-5461
selectively induces nucleolar stress resulting in p53mediated apoptosis of MYC-driven B-lymphoma cells
in vivo with minimal effects on wild type cells of the same
lineage [21, 25]. The canonical nucleolar stress pathway,
initiated following disruption of ribosome biogenesis, is
characterized by the release of ribosomal proteins (RPs),
predominantly RPL5 and RPL11, from the nucleolus,
which bind MDM2 and thereby relieves its inhibitory
activity towards p53 [1, 30, 31].
While the therapeutic efficacy of Pol I inhibition
in B-cell lymphomas has been linked to p53 activation
[21, 25], we have demonstrated in earlier studies that the
efficacy of CX-5461 in solid tumours is independent of
p53 and is associated with cell cycle arrest, senescence
and autophagy [32]. Recently, CX-5461 was reported to
induce p53-independent G2 checkpoint and apoptosis
mediated by the Ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)

Inhibition of Pol I transcription by CX-5461
induces p53-independent G1 and G2 checkpoints
To understand the mechanisms underlying the
biological response to inhibition of Pol I transcription
initiation including p53-independent responses, we
examined the cellular effect of CX-5461 on primary
TERT-immortalized human foreskin fibroblasts (BJT) and BJ-T cells stably expressing p53 shRNA (BJ-T
p53sh) (Figure 1A). Treatment of BJ-T and BJ-T p53sh
cells for 1 hour (h) with 1 µM CX-5461 reduced Pol I
transcription initiation rates by approximately 90%
(Inhibitory Concentration 90% (IC90)) (Figure 1B).
Consistent with our previous studies [21, 32], at this

drug concentration we observed no effect on Pol IImediated transcription of MYC, whose mRNA half-life
(~35 minutes) is similar to pre-rRNA (Figure 1B), thus
demonstrating the selectivity of CX-5461 for Pol I- versus
Pol II-mediated transcription. Our previous reports using
lymphoma cells demonstrated that inhibition of Pol I
transcription initiation by CX-5461 led to induction of
p53 protein levels and p53-mediated apoptosis [21, 25].
We therefore examined the effect of CX-5461 on
p53 levels in BJ-T cells as well as the knockdown
levels of p53 in p53sh cells after 24 h of CX-5461
treatment (Figure 1A). CX-5461 led to p53 protein
stabilization and induced expression of its transcriptional
target p21 while no induction in p53 and p21 protein levels
were detected in BJ-T p53sh cells confirming the efficacy
of p53 knockdown (Figure 1A). Treatment of BJ-T cells
with 1 µM CX-5461 did not induce cell death (Figure 1C)
but instead caused a pronounced decrease in cell
proliferation (Figure 1D) consistent with the activation
of p53 and increased p21 expression (Figure 1A). BJ-T
p53sh cells also exhibited a proliferation defect in
response to 1 µM CX-5461, consistent with our observed
p53-independent CX-5461-mediated growth inhibitory
responses in solid tumor cell lines [32]. After chronic
treatment with CX-5461, both BJ-T and BJ-T p53sh cells
displayed markers associated with senescence including
flattened morphology and increased β-galactosidase
staining (Figure S1A and S1B). Thus, inhibition of Pol I
transcription initiation by CX-5461 in primary cells leads
to senescence, which occurs independently of p53 status.
To examine in detail the consequences of inhibiting
Pol I transcription initiation on the cell cycle we examined
cell cycle progression after 6, 24 and 48 and 96 h of
CX-5461 treatment and evaluated cell cycle progression
using BrdU incorporation (Figure 2A). Both vehicle and
CX-5461-treated BJ-T cells exhibited higher proportion
of cells in G1 over time due to confluence induced growth
arrest (Figure 2B). However, CX-5461-treated BJ-T
cells exhibited a delay in S–phase progression within 6 h
of treatment and a halt in BrdU incorporation by 24 h
with cells accumulating in the G1 and G2 phases of the
cell cycle (Figure 2A and 2B). In contrast, BJ-T p53sh
cells continued to incorporate BrdU by 24 h and 48 h
but exhibited a pronounced S-phase delay and a G2 cell
cycle arrest by 96 h (Figure 2A). The increase in G2arrested cells at 24 h of CX-5461 treatment is concomitant
with a significant decrease in the percentage of cells
accumulating in G1 (Figure 2C). Furthermore, both BJ-T
and BJ-T p53sh cells treated with CX-5461 for 24 h did
not show an increase in histone H3 phosphorylation on
serine 10 even when BJ-p53sh were treated with CX-5461
in the presence of nocodazole suggesting that they arrest in
the G2 checkpoint before entry into mitosis (Figure S1C
and S1D). The data suggest that p53 depletion allows
the cells, at least partially, to bypass the G1 checkpoint
before arresting in G2 in a p53-independent manner.
Nevertheless, a distinct pool of BJ-T p53sh cells remained
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

arrested in G1, suggesting additional p53-independent
mechanisms underlying the G1 arrest in response to acute
inhibition of Pol I transcription initiation by CX-5461.
Taken together these data demonstrate that while CX-5461
induces a p53-mediated G1 checkpoint, it also activates
p53-independent G1, S-phase and G2 checkpoints.

CX-5461 activates ATM/ATR signaling pathways
independent of p53
To explore the mechanisms underlying the
CX-5461-mediated G2 cell cycle arrest, we examined
the activity of the G2 checkpoint kinases ATM and ATR.
ATM phosphorylates multiple substrates including the
histone variant H2AX on serine 139 (γH2AX), CHK2
on threonine 68 and p53 on serine 15. Phosphorylation
of H2AX signals that DNA damage has occurred and
is required for the assembly of proteins associated with
DDR (Reviewed in [36, 37]). Once activated, CHK2
phosphorylates many substrates involved in cell cycle
progression including p53 and the CDC25 family of
phosphatases. CHK2 inactivates the CDC25 phosphatases,
leading to the maintenance of inhibitory phosphorylation
(tyrosine 15) of cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) such as
CDK2 and CDK1 and the initiation of S and G2 cell cycle
checkpoints. The major substrate of ATR is CHK1, which
upon activation by phosphorylation at serine residues 317
and 345 also phosphorylates the CDC25 phosphatases
(Reviewed in [37]).
To investigate acute responses to CX-5461, BJ-T
and BJ-T p53sh cells were treated with 1 µM CX-5461 and
activation of ATM/ATR pathway signaling was examined
at 30 minutes (min), 1, 2 and 3 hours (Figure 3A).
Increases in the abundance of phosphorylated CHK1
(S345), ATM (S1981) and CHK2 (T68) and total CHK1
were detected by 30 min, which was associated with an
increase in the inhibitory CDK1 (Y15) phosphorylation
that is known to be involved in initiating the G2
checkpoint (Figure 3A). Intriguingly, total CDK1 levels
were induced in BJ-T p53sh cells compared to BJ-T cells
in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that p53
negatively regulates CDK1 expression [38]. Nevertheless
BJ-T p53sh cells underwent p53-independent G2 cell
cycle arrest (Figure 2A and 2C). CX-5461 also induced
phosphorylation of p53 on serine 15, which is a direct
substrate of ATM and ATR [39–42]. However, CX-5461
mediated activation of ATM and ATR signaling in BJ-T
and BJ-T p53sh cells occurs independently of increases
in γH2AX levels, a marker of DNA double strand breaks.
Although basal H2AX and γH2AX levels are induced
in BJ-T p53sh cells in agreement with p53’s role in
regulating H2AX levels [43], no further induction in
γH2AX levels was detected following acute CX-5461
treatment, indicating that CX-5461 mediated activation of
ATM/ATR signaling occurs in the absence of global DNA
damage and independently of p53.

To determine the contribution of ATM and ATR
signaling to CX-5461-mediated G1, S and G2 checkpoints,
we examined CHK1, CHK2 and p53 phosphorylation in
fluorescence-activated-cell sorted (FACS) sorted G1, S
and G2 populations (Figure 3B). BJ-T and BJ-T p53sh
cells were treated with vehicle or 1 µM CX-5461 for 2h
at which time point optimal p53 phosphorylation at S15
as well as robust levels of CHK1 (S345) and CHK2 (T68)
phosphorylation were observed (Figure 3A). In BJ-T cells,
phosphorylation of the ATR target CHK1 at S345 occurred
predominantly in S phase and to lesser extent in G1 and G2,
while CHK2 (T68) and p53 (S15) phosphorylation were
detected mainly in the S and G2 populations (Figure 3B).
In contrast, p53 protein levels increased at all stages of

the cell cycle following CX-5461 treatment (Figure 3B).
Therefore, the data suggest a role for p53 in mediating the
G1 arrest while ATM and ATR mediate the S-phase delay
and the G2 arrest in BJ-T cells in response to CX-5461.
In BJ-T p53sh cells, CX-5461 induced an increase in
phosphorylated CHK2 (T68) at all stages of the cell cycle
while CHK1 (S345) phosphorylation was predominant in
the S phase population and to a lesser extent in the G1
and G2 pools. Thus, in BJ-T p53sh cells, ATM and ATR
activity is associated with CX-5461-mediated S-phase
delay while ATM activity correlated with CX-5461induced p53-independent G1 and G2 arrest (Figure 2B).
To further define the relative roles of ATM and ATR
in CX-5461-mediated cell cycle defects, we pre-treated

BJ-T (Figure 3C) and BJ-T p53sh cells (Figure 3D)
with ATM (KU-55933, ATMi) and ATR (VE-821, ATRi)
inhibitors alone or in combination for 30 min
followed by 2h of CX-5461. Pre-treatment with ATMi
completely abolished CX-5461-mediated CHK2 (T68)
phosphorylation but not CHK1 (S345) phosphorylation in
both cell types (Figure 3C, lane 2 versus 4; Figure 3D,
lane 4 versus 6). Conversely, pre-treatment with the
ATRi prevented CX-5461-mediated CHK1 (S345)
phosphorylation but did not affect the abundance of

phosphorylated CHK2 (T68) (Figure 3C, lane 2 versus 6;
Figure 3D, lane 4 versus 8). In BJ-T cells, p53 (S15)
phosphorylation was attenuated after combined inhibition
of ATM and ATR (Figure 3C, lane 2 versus 8). Thus, in
response to inhibition of Pol I transcription initiation
by CX-5461 ATM and ATR are independently activated
upstream of p53 (Figure 3C).
We then investigated whether ATMi, ATRi or the
combination of ATMi/ATRi could abrogate CX-5461induced cell cycle checkpoints. Co-treatment of CX-5461

with ATMi or ATRi alone had no effect on the CX-5461mediated G1 or the G2 arrest but partially relieved the
S-phase delay of BJ-T and BJ-T p53sh cells (Figure 4A).
However, dual ATM and ATR inhibition led BJ-T p53sh
cells to bypass the G1 arrest and resulted in cell death, as
demonstrated by the increase in the Sub-G1 DNA content
fraction (Figure 4B) and the decrease in cell confluence in
proliferation assays (Figure 4C). CX-5461-mediated cell
death was associated with an increase in the proportion of
cells displaying abnormal nuclei and genomic instability
(Figure S2A, S2B, S2D and S2E). Thus, dual ATM and
ATR inhibition in combination with CX-5461 in BJ-T
p53sh cells promoted mitotic catastrophe (Figure S2A,
S2B, S2D and S2E). While, BJ-T cells remained

arrested following combined CX-5461 and ATM/ATR
inhibition most likely due to activation of p53 through
the canonical nucleolar stress pathway, BJ-T p53sh cells
underwent abnormal mitosis and cell death in response
to the abrogation of the ATM/ATR-mediated cell cycle
checkpoints (Figure 4B and 4C; Figure S2).

Inhibition of ATM/ATR signaling sensitizes
cancer cells to CX-5461 mediated cell death
To compare the biological response to inhibition
of Pol I transcription initiation of cancer cells to those of
primary cell, we utilized the tumorigenic LSTR cell line,
an isogenic BJ-derived cell line expressing SV40 early

CHK1, CHK2, CDK1 and H2AX proteins and antibodies that detect actin and Tubulin protein levels. (B) BJ-T and BJ-p53sh cells were

Cells were sorted using BD FACS Aria, into G1 and S phase and G2/M populations based on DNA content and total protein lysates were
extracted. Western blot analysis was performed to examine phosphorylation levels of p53, CHK1 and CHK2 proteins as well as total p53
and Tubulin. Active RB and Cyclin B levels were used as quality control markers for G1 and G2 populations. The reduction in active RB
levels in BJ-T p53shRNA cells is likely due to the fact that RB is a transcriptional target of p53 [83]. (C) BJ-T and (D) BJ-T p53sh cells
were pretreated for 30 min with either DMSO, 5 µM KU-5593 (ATMi), 5 µM VE-821 (ATRi) or 5 µM ATMi/ 5 µM ATRi before vehicle
or 1 µM CX-5461 were added to the cultures for further 2 h. Western blot analysis for phosphorylated and total CHK1, CHK2 and p53 were
performed. All experiments in A-D are representatives of n = 3.

region (large-T and small-t), TERT, and an oncogenic
allele of the HRAS gene (HRASG12V), which can grow
tumours in nude mice [44]. Intriguingly, similar to BJ-T
and BJ-T p53sh cells, CX-5461 treatment induced a
proliferation defect in the BJ-LSTR cells despite SV40mediated inactivation of the p53 and retinoblastoma
protein (RB) families of tumour suppressors (Figure S3A).
Although BJ-LSTR cells exhibited increased G2
population following CX-5461 treatment, they also
showed increased ploidy with accumulating N4 and N8
DNA content (Figure S3B and S3C). However, these cells

did not proliferate following treatment with CX-5461
(Figure S3A) possibly due to failed cytokinesis, which
is consistent with the increase in DNA content per cell
(Figure S3B and S3C). Thus in the absence of ongoing
rRNA transcription both immortalized and transformed
fibroblast are unable to execute normal cell proliferation,
suggesting that in the absence of intact G1 and G2
checkpoints inhibition of Pol I transcription initiation
induces additional p53 and RB independent checkpoint(s)
preventing cell division. Importantly, similar to BJ-T
p53sh cells, the BJ-LSTR cells underwent mitotic

catastrophe (Figure S2C and S2F) and cell death following
combined inhibition of Pol I transcription initiation and
ATM/ATR as indicated by the decrease in cell confluency
in proliferation assays (Figure S3D). Taken together, the
data strongly suggest the inhibition of ATM/ATR pathways
sensitizes p53-null cells to CX-5461 induced cell death via
mitotic catastrophe following the failure of G1, S and G2
checkpoints.
We therefore examined the therapeutic efficacy
of combining inhibition of ATM/ATR signaling with
CX-5461 in MYC driven B-cell lymphomas (Eµ-Myc).
Our previous work showed that the therapeutic efficacy of
CX-5461 in the Eµ-Myc lymphoma model was associated
with the presence of a functional p53 pathway [21, 25]
(Figure 5A). CX-5461 induced p53 protein levels [21]
as well as phosphorylation of p53 (S15) (Figure 5B) in
a dose-dependent manner and increased apoptosis of p53
wild-type (Tp53 Wt) Eµ-Myc lymphoma cells (Figure 5A).
However, in addition to promoting cell death, as
indicated by an elevated proportion of sub-G1 cells, CX5461 induced G2-arrest in Tp53-null (Tp53−/−) Eµ-Myc
lymphoma cells (Figure 5A). CX-5461 induced CHK1
(S345) phosphorylation in Tp53 Wt as well as Tp53−/−
EµMyc cells (Figure 5B), suggesting CX-5461 activates
ATR signaling in a p53 independent manner as observed in
the BJ-T p53sh cells (Figure 3). We could not examine the
status of pCHK2 (T68) due to the lack of mouse specific
anti-CHK2 antibodies.
In order to examine the contribution of ATM/ATR
activation to CX-5461-mediated G2 arrest in Eµ-Myc
lymphoma cells, we combined CX-5461 with a dual
CHK1/CHK2 inhibitor (CHK1/2i; AZD7762) and found
that CX-5461/CHK1/2i combination abrogates the G2
arrest and renders Tp53−/− Eµ-Myc cell lines sensitive to
cell death (Figure 5A and 5C). We therefore investigated
whether this combination could be effective in treating
MYC-driven p53 wild type and null lymphoma in vivo. In
mice transplanted with Tp53−/− Eμ-Myc B-lymphoma cells,
CX-5461 and CHK1/2i as single agents provided a modest
survival benefit (median 3.5 days) and no survival benefit,
respectively (Figure 5D). However against this aggressive
Eµ−Myc B-cell lymphoma, the CX-5461/CHK1/2i
combination had a significantly improved therapeutic
benefit compared to single agent treatment. Thus, G2
checkpoint inactivation, which leads to cell death due to
mitotic catastrophe in p53-null cells in vitro (Figure S2),
can expand the therapeutic efficacy of CX-5461
in targeting cancers lacking functional p53.

phosphorylation of H2AX (S139) was only detected after
exposure to ionizing radiation (IR) and UV (Figure 6B).
Further, there was no increase in γH2AX foci formation
following 30 min of CX-5461 treatment of BJ-T cells
(Figure S4A), at which time point robust activation of
CHK1 and CHK2 was detected (Figure 3A). To further
examine whether CX-5461 might be associated with DNA
damage, we used the alkaline comet assay, a sensitive
method to detect SSBs, DSBs or base modifications at
the single cell level [45]. We found no evidence for DNA
damage after 30 min of CX-5461 of BJ-T cells (Figure 6C).
In contrast, long comet tails were detected following
exposure to UV irradiation. Together, our data suggest that
the acute activation of ATM/ATR signaling by CX-5461
occurs in the absence of detectable global DNA damage.
To discount the possibility that our γH2AX IF
technique was not sensitive enough to detect DNA
damage at the rDNA repeats, we used the doxycyclineinducible U2TR IPpoI-dd U2OS cell line in which DNA
damage can be induced at a defined site at the rDNA.
IPpoI is an intron-encoded homing endonuclease from the
myxomycete Physarum polycephalum that cuts with high
specificity at an endogenous 15 base-pairs (bp) recognition
sequence within the 28S transcribed region of the 300
copies of rDNA and up to 13 other sites in the human
genome [46, 47]. Induction of IPpoI induced-DSBs at the
rDNA (Figure S4B) resulted in nucleolar segregation and
enrichment in γH2AX at the nucleolar caps (Figure S4C
and S4D), which are characterized by the condensation
and separation of the nucleolar compartments and
constitute nucleolar proteins such as the upstream binding
transcription factor UBF [47, 48]. However, we did
not detect γH2AX at the nucleoli following CX-5461
treatment further suggesting that CX-5461 does not induce
DSBs at the rDNA (Figure S4C and S4D).
To further investigate the possibility of CX-5461
inducing DNA damage at the rDNA loci in cells at specific
stages of the cell cycle, we performed IF analysis of
γH2AX combined with nucleophosmin (NPM1) staining,
as a marker for the nucleoli, in FUCCI (fluorescent
ubiquitinylation cell cycle indicator) [49] labeled BJ-T
p53sh cells. We used BJ-T p53sh cells to enrich for the
S-phase and G2 populations to examine the presence of
γH2AX foci within the nucleoli in late G1-S transition
(yellow) or late S-G2/M (green) cell populations following
1h of treatment with CX-5461 (Figure 6D). We found no
evidence for global nor nucleoli associated γH2AX foci
formation in response to CX-5461 treatment of S and G2
cells as compared to IR-induced γH2AX foci (Figure 6D,
Figure S5A). Therefore, our data suggest that acute
ATM/ATR activation in response to CX-5461 occurs
independently of DNA breaks. Differential activation of
ATM substrates has been reported under conditions of
non-canonical activation of ATM such as oxidative stress
[50, 51]. Further, ATM’s recruitment to chromatin, which
is mediated by the MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 complex, has

strand DNA breaks, DSBs and SSBs respectively. While

Inhibition of rRNA synthesis per se does not

been reported to initiate DNA damage signaling without
actual DNA damage [52]. We therefore performed IF
analysis of phosphorylated Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome
1 (NBS1) at (S343), a component of the MRE complex
and a substrate for ATM kinase activity [53]. Unlike
γH2AX, pNBS1 (S343) was detected within the nucleoli
following 1h of CX-5461 treatment in S-phase cells
(Figure 6E, Figure S5B). Thus, the data strongly suggest
that inhibition of Pol I transcription initiation by CX-5461
leads to DNA damage-independent activation of ATM
signaling in the nucleoli.

In order to further understand the p53-independent
global biological response to CX-5461-mediated
nucleolar stress at the transcriptional level, we performed
high throughput RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis
following a time course (30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h)
of 1 µM CX-5461 in BJ-T p53sh cells. We compared
this response to another inhibitor of Pol I transcription,

treatment only 4 Pol II transcribed genes (HES1, DUSP1,

in antiproliferative AP-1 and TGFβ-transcriptional
programs as well as immune response pathways including
those associated with NF-κB and JAK/STAT signaling
pathways (Figure S6C–S6E). These expression signatures
including the immune response reflect the senescence
phenotype observed following chronic treatment with
CX-5461 (Figure S1A) [54]. Gene expression signatures
of immune response pathways were also observed after
3 h of Act D treatment (Table 2). Interestingly, the gene
expression signature of the DNA damage-ATM/ATR
mediated G2 checkpoint was unique to the early treatment
time points of CX-5461 (1, 3 and 6 h), consistent with
CX-5461-mediated activation of ATM/ATR signaling
(Figure 3). Consistent with this Act D treatment
(5 nM and 10 nM), which at 3h achieved similar levels of
Pol I transcription inhibition compared to CX-5461 did
not activate ATM/ATR signaling (Figure 7B), although it
induced stabilization of p53 possibly through the canonical
ribosomal protein-MDM2 nucleolar stress pathway [28].
At low concentrations, Act D (5 nM) preferentially
intercalates into GC-rich regions of rDNA and inhibits
Pol I transcription at the level of elongation in contrast to
CX-5461, which blocks recruitment of Pol I and preinitiation complex formation [32, 55, 56]. In agreement
with these differential mechanisms of Pol I transcription
inhibition, Act D did not affect Pol I recruitment to
the rDNA promoter although Pol I binding across the
transcribed region was reduced in BJ-T p53sh cells
(Figure 7C). In marked contrast, CX-5461 induced
a significant reduction in Pol I binding at the rDNA
promoter and across the transcribed region (Figure 7C).
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

These observations together with the lack of ATM/ATR
activation by Act D are consistent with a model whereby
CX-5461-induced defects in Pol I complex assembly at the
rDNA promoter rather than rRNA synthesis rates per se
are responsible for ATM/ATR checkpoint activation.
In human cells, only a subset of the 300 rDNA
repeats is transcribed at any given time. Active rDNA
chromatin is open/accessible and bound by UBF, which is
essential in determining and maintaining the active rDNA
state [9, 57–59]. While, silenced rDNA is devoid of UBF
and Pol I and can be distinguished from the active rDNA
pool by differential accessibility to psoralen followed by
Southern blotting [58]. UBF binding to rDNA was not
altered in response to CX-5461 or Act D (Figure 7D),
nor was the ratio of active to silent rDNA pool affected
after 3 h of CX-5461 treatment (Figure S7A). Therefore,
upon CX-5461 treatment Pol I is depleted from the rDNA
however the rDNA remains stably bound by UBF and
in an open configuration structure. Consistent with this,
nucleosome positioning by micrcoccal nuclease (MNase)
accessibility assay revealed that CX-5461, but not Act D,
led to a significant decrease in protection against MNase
digestion at the rDNA promoter (Figure 7E), presumably
due, at least in part, to loss of Pol I. This suggests that
CX-5461-mediated reductions in Pol I recruitment
leads to ‘exposed’ rDNA repeats, a configuration that is
presumably not encountered during normal physiology.
Our data suggest that this abnormal rDNA chromatin leads
to activation of the ATM/ATR pathway.
Further, consistent with our previous results [21],
CX-5461 treatment is associated with nucleolar disruption

as demonstrated by the delocalization of a proportion
of NPM1 and Fibrillarin (FBL) into the nucleoplasm
(Figure 6D and 6E, Figure S7B) [21]. This correlated with
the collapse of the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs)
within the nucleoli. CX-5461-mediated condensation of
the rDNA loci within the nucleoli is distinct to the reported
delocalization of rDNA into the nucleolar periphery
following IPpoI-induced rDNA DSBs [47]. This finding
further reinforces the notion that the biological response
to acute Pol I inhibition by CX-5461 is distinct and
independent of DNA damage and that defects in rDNA
chromatin or changes in rDNA topology can directly
activate ATM/ATR leading to S and G2 checkpoint
activation.

In this paper, we extend these findings by examining the
mechanisms underlying the p53-independent cellular
response to Pol I transcription inhibition by CX-5461 in
order to further improve its application in the clinic. Our
studies reveal a p53-independent immediate response to
CX-5461 involving rapid activation of G1, S-phase and
G2 checkpoints leading to cell cycle arrest, senescence
or cell death depending on the cell’s genotype. Our data
suggest that in the absence of p53, CX-5461-induces a
G1 checkpoint that is associated with ATM activation.
In addition, CX-5461 induces ATM and ATR-mediated
S-phase delay and G2 arrest. Further, we demonstrate that
the combination of CX-5461 and inhibition of ATM/ATR
signaling in p53-null cells induces mitotic catastrophe
and subsequent cell death. Importantly, the combination
of CX-5461 and inhibition of ATM/ATR signaling leads
to enhanced therapeutic efficacy in treating an aggressive
Tp53−/− Eµ-Myc lymphoma in vivo. Inactivation of cell
cycle checkpoints leading to mitotic catastrophe is likely
to be key to the improved capacity of CX-5461 in killing
Tp53−/− MYC-driven cancer cells.
CX-5461 was developed as a highly specific
inhibitor of Pol I transcription initiation (with ~200-fold
higher selectivity for Pol I over Pol II transcription due to
its ability to disrupt the recruitment of the selectivity factor
1 (SL-1) to the rDNA promoter [32]. Unlike quarfloxin
(CX-3543), which is a G-quadruplex (G4) interactive
agent that inhibits Pol I by disrupting nucleolin/rDNA G4
complexes [60], CX-5461 was not developed to target G4
DNA. Consistent with this, we do not detect G-quadruplex
stabilization with CX-5461 at 1 µM for 1 h in BJ-T cells
using the 1H6 antibody [61], which is specific to different
G4 DNA structures (results not shown). This suggests that

Discussion
We developed a new class of cancer therapeutics
that selectively inhibit Pol I transcription [26, 27, 32, 60].
Further, we demonstrated that one of these inhibitors,
CX-5461, which is currently undergoing phase 1 clinical
trials for haematological cancers, treats lymphomas
by activating a nucleolar stress pathway that induces
p53-mediated apoptosis [21, 25]. Activation of p53 via
ribosomal protein-mediated inactivation of MDM2 is
a major mechanism through which cell cycle arrest or
apoptosis is induced in response to altered ribosome
biogenesis. Importantly however, we also showed
that the therapeutic efficacy of CX-5461 to treat solid
tumours does not correlate with p53 status [32]. More
recently, CX-5461 has been reported to induce a p53independent G2 arrest and apoptosis dependent upon
ATM/ATR activity in lymphoblastic leukaemia [33, 34].

of G-quadruplex stabilization, which had been associated
with replication defects and subsequent activation of ATR
mediated-ATM signaling [62], is unlikely to account
for the induction of ATM and ATR signaling by CX5461. On the other hand, Ellipticines interact with DNA
and specifically inhibits Pol I transcription by affecting
the three-dimensional rDNA structure and preventing
SL-1 from binding to the rRNA promoter. However,

Ellipticines induced ATM/ATR-independent cell cycle
defects [63]. To further test the specificity of CX-5461
in activating ATM/ATR pathway signaling, we utilized
CX-5447, a closely related structural analogue of CX5461 that is inactive against Pol I transcription [32], does
not induce CHK2 (T68) phosphorylation (Figure S8A
and S8B) and has no effect on cell cycle progression
(Figure S8C). Therefore, our data strongly suggest that

CX-5461’s ability to rapidly block Pol I recruitment and
binding to the rDNA leading to exposed rDNA structures,
triggers ATM/ATR pathway activation as opposed to offtarget effects of the drug unrelated to Pol I inhibition.
In an attempt to further demonstrate the specificity of
inhibiting Pol I transcription initiation in activating ATM/
ATR pathway signaling, we performed RNA interference
(RNAi)-mediated knockdown of POLR1A, the largest
subunit of the Pol I complex and the Pol I specific
transcription initiation factor RRN3 in order to inhibit Pol
I transcription initiation by means other than CX-5461
(Figure S8D). However, knocking down POLR1A and
RRN3 protein levels by greater than 90% after 48 hours
of siRNA transfection only reduced 47S rRNA precursor
levels by 25% and 50% compared to control after 12 hours
and 48 hours of transfection, respectively (Figure S8D and
S8E). siRNA knock down of POLR1A and RRN3 was
associated with the induction of p53 protein levels and G2
cell cycle arrest but it did not lead to activation of ATM/
ATR signaling (Figure S8B and S8C). By comparison,
CX-5461 caused acute reduction in 47S rRNA levels by
70% within 30 min that was maintained at this level or
greater over 48 hours (Figure S8F and Figure7A). The
temporal and quantitative differences in cellular responses
to these two approaches of inhibiting Pol I transcription
initiation is consistent with previous studies demonstrating
that RNAi phenotypes do not always correlate with small
molecule inhibition profiles for a number of biological
reasons [64]. In particular, the inability of RNAi targeting
Pol I to robustly inhibit Pol I activity may be due to the
fact that less than 10% of the total Pol I enzyme complex
is transcriptionally active at any one time [65]. Thus, even
removing 90% of the available Pol I enzyme may have
little effect on the pool of active polymerase. Moreover,
effective silencing of gene expression using RNAi is in
part dependent on the half-life of the targeted protein and
occurs on the timescale of hours to days after transfection
providing ample time for cellular compensatory responses
to be activated. In contrast, chemical approaches
immediately inhibit their target leaving little opportunity
for activation of compensatory mechanisms. Taken
together, our data support a model by which CX-5461
rapidly inhibits Pol I loading on the rDNA repeat leading
to exposed rDNA chromatin that activates ATM signaling
within the nucleoli. Such rapid effects on rDNA topology
cannot be temporally replicated through RNAi to Pol I
components.
The rapid (within 30 min) activation of ATM/ATR
signaling by CX-5461 occurs in the absence of global
DNA damage (Figure 3 and Figure 6). This is consistent
with reports suggesting that DDR may differ considerably
depending on alternative triggers, sensing mechanisms
and cellular context [51]. For instance, oxidative stressmediated non-canonical activation of ATM occurs in
the absence of DSBs and does not lead to formation of
γH2AX domains. Yet, CHK2 and p53 are phosphorylated
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

by oxidation-activated ATM [50]. We did not observe
γH2AX foci formation nor induction in γH2AX protein
levels following treatment with CX-5461 over short
time points (up to 6 h) (Figure 6B). However, we have
observed γH2AX foci formation following long-term
treatment with CX-5461 of BJ-T cells (greater than 48 h)
(Figure S9A), which did not coincide with either the CX5461-mediated rapid reduction in rDNA transcription or
alterations in nucleolar structure. Instead, it coincided
with increased β-galactosidase staining (Figure S1A)
suggesting that the formation γH2AX foci is a delayed and
indirect response to treatment with CX-5461. Importantly,
the γH2AX signal did not overlap with rDNA implying
that DSBs did not arise at the rDNA (Figure S9A). Thus,
this is consistent with CX-5461’s acute activation of
ATM/ATR without DNA damage. Interestingly, pretreatment of BJ-T cells with CX-5461 prior to exposure
to UV radiation led to an increase in UV-induced DNA
damage as determined by increased length of comet
tails (Figure S9B), suggesting that CX-5461 treatment
increases cells sensitivity to DNA damaging agents. This
could be due to attenuated DNA repair as a consequence
of CX-5461-mediated deregulation of nucleolar structure
and function [66]. Importantly, this raises the possibility
of enhanced efficacy for CX-5461 in treating cancer
cells with compromised DNA repair pathways as well
as the potential of combining CX-5461 with standard
chemotherapy to improve therapeutic efficacy.
Furthermore, tumours bearing high levels of
oncogene-induced DNA damage response (DDR), such
as MYC driven murine lymphoma (Eµ-Myc) and human
B-cell lymphomas, are sensitive to therapeutic targeting
of DNA-dependent Protein Kinase (DNA-PK) and
ATM/ ATR [67–69]. Inhibition of aberrantly active DDR
signaling pathway has become an attractive therapeutic
strategy in cancer therapy with highly selective small
molecule inhibitors of ATM and ATR signaling in
preclinical and clinical development, respectively [70].
Thus, the potential efficacy of combining DDR pathway
inhibitors with CX-5461 provides a rationale for further
clinical evaluation of this therapeutic strategy particularly
in p53-null cancers.
Mechanistically, our study strongly suggests
that CX-5461 induces chromatin changes at the rDNA
repeats leading to activation of ATM signaling within
the nucleoli. Indeed, a role for chromatin structure and
dynamics as triggers for ATM/ATR activation in the
absence of DNA breaks is consistent with several other
reports [71–74]. Treatments that perturb chromatin
structure without apparently inducing DNA damage,
such as hypotonic conditions, chloroquine, trichostatin A,
chromatin factor depletion and spliceosome displacement
have been reported to induce ATM kinase activity
[51, 52, 73, 75–77]. Therefore, our study suggests that
CX-5461-mediated perturbations in rDNA chromatin such
as, “exposed” structures devoid of Pol I and alterations

Triton X-100 for 30 min then pelleted and washed in 1
mL of 0.1M Na2B4O7.10H2O (pH 8.5). Cell pellets were
sequentially incubated for 30 min with anti-BrdU and
Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Supplemental
methods, Table 2) in PBS containing 2% FBS and 0.5%
Tween-20. Cells were washed with PBS- 2% FBS then
incubated in RNaseA containing 10 mg/mL PI solution at
37°C for 15 min. Cells were analyzed on the FACSCanto
II and cell-cycle analysis was performed using FCS
Express software (De Novo, Los Angeles, CA, USA).
For Annexin-V analysis cells were stained with
Annexin-V-APC (BD Pharmigen 550474) and 10 μg/
mL PI and analyzed with the BD FACSCanto II. Flow
cytometry data was analysed with FCSExpress software.

in rDNA topology can directly activate ATM/ATR. Taken
together, our data demonstrate that the integrity of rDNA
chromatin is directly coupled to ATM/ATR signaling.
In summary, our data identify a novel p53independent nucleolar stress pathway that senses
perturbations in rDNA chromatin structure and dynamics
leading to activation of ATM/ATR signaling and a prompt
halt in cell cycle progression and provide a rationale for
clinical evaluation of combining DDR pathway inhibitors
with CX-5461 to treat in p53-null cancers.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, retroviral infection and treatment
with pharmacological inhibitors

Animal experiments

BJ cell lines were cultured in DMEM with 10%
FBS (fetal bovine serum) at 37°C in 5% CO2 atmosphere.
BJ-T shRNA stable cell lines were generated using
retroviral transduction with pRetroSuper (pRS) vectors,
which confers puromycin resistance, kindly provided
by R. Agami and R. Bernards (The Netherlands
Cancer Institute) [78]. The shRNA targeting p53 was
generated using the following 19-nucleotide sequences
(5′-GACTCCAGTGGTAATCTAC-3′) that act as short
interfering RNA (siRNA)-like molecules to stably
suppress gene expression [78]. The FUCCI-labeled BJ-T
p53sh cell line was produced by lentiviral transduction
of pCSII-EF-mCherry-hCdt1(30/120) and pCSII-EFmVenus-hGeminin(1/110) (kindly provided by Dr.
Atsushi Miyawaki, RIKEN, Japan) [49]. Eμ-Myc clonal
B-lymphoma cell lines were generated and cultured as
described previously [21, 69].
CX-5461 and CX-5447 were provided by Cylene
Pharmaceuticals and Senhwa Biosciences (San Diego,
CA, USA). For use in vitro 10mM stocks of CX-5461
and CX-5447 in 50 mM NaH2PO4 (Vehicle), 10 mM
stocks of KU-55933, VE-821 and AZD7762 (obtained
from Selleckchem) were prepared in DMSO and 1 mM
stocks of Acintomycin D (Act D) (Sigma) were prepared
in ethanol.

All animal experiments were performed with
approval from the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Animal
Experimentation Ethics Committee. C57Bl/6 mice (Walter
and Eliza Hall Institute, Parkville, VIC, Australia) were
intravenously injected with 2 × 105 Eμ-Myc B-lymphoma
cells in PBS and treated with pharmacological inhibitors
from 8 days post-injection. Treatment of mice was
continued until an ethical end-point was reached; hunched
posture, ruffled fur, enlarged lymph nodes, laboured
breathing, weight loss greater than 20% of start body
weight and limited mobility or paralysis.
For use in vivo CX-5461 was prepared in 25 mM
NaH2PO4 (pH4.5) and given by oral gavage at 30 mg/
kg every three days. AZD7762 (Medchem Express) was
delivered intraperitoneally in 10.3% -hydroxypropylβ-cyclodextrin in 0.9% saline at 20 mg/kg daily on
weekdays.
Reverse transcription qPCR, Western blot
analysis, ChIP, Immunofluorescence-fluorescent in situ
hybridisation (IF-FISH), psoralen crosslinking and
chromatin accessibility by real time-PCR (CHART-PCR)
assays were carried out as described previously [58, 59]. A
brief summary of these assays and lists of antibodies and
primer sequences are provided in the Supplementary Data.

Cell cycle analysis

Comet assay

For cell cycle analysis experiments using propidium
iodide (PI), cells were pelleted and fixed in 80% ice-cold
ethanol and stored at 4°C until further processing. Cells
were stained with PI at 50 μg/ml in PBS containing RNase
A and analyzed by flow cytometry on the BD FACSCanto
II analyzer (BD Biosciences). The percentage of cells in
G0/G1, S and G2/M phases were determined using Modfit
3.0 software.
For cell cycle analysis using 5-bromo-2′deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation, cells were labeled
with 10 µM BrdU for 30 min, washed twice with PBS,
collected and harvested as above. Cells were pelleted

Comet Assays were performed under alkaline
conditions using Trevigen CometAssay Reagent Kit (Cat.
# 4250-050-K).

RNA-seq
Sequencing libraries were prepared using the TruSeq
RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) and sequenced
on a Illumina HiSeq2500 platform at Peter MacCallum
Cancer Centre (50 bp, PE). The generated 50 bp pairedend reads were aligned to the genome using Bowtie2 [79]

with default parameters and the reads counted using HTSeq
[80]. The differential expression was then calculated
utilizing the DEseq package [81] in R (version 3.0.2) [82].
Only differentially expressed genes with FDR ≤ 0.1 and
logFC ≤ −0.5 or logFC ≥ 0.5 were considered for further
analysis.
