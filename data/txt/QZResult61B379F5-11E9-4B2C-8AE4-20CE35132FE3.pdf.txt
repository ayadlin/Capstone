Abstract
Her2 is overexpressed in 20% to 30% of breast tumors and
correlates with reduced disease-free and overall patient
survival. Trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody
directed against Her2, represents the first Her2-targeted
therapy, which decreases the risk of relapse and prolongs
patient survival. Resistance to trastuzumab, both inherent
and treatment-acquired, represents a significant barrier to the
effective treatment of Her2 (+) breast cancer. The Met receptor
tyrosine kinase is aberrantly expressed in breast cancer and
predicts poor patient prognosis. In this study, we find that
Met is frequently expressed in Her2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells, as well as Her2 (+) breast cancer. Importantly,
Met contributes to trastuzumab resistance, as inhibition
of Met sensitizes cells to trastuzumab-mediated growth
inhibition, whereas Met activation protects cells against
trastuzumab by abrogating p27 induction. Remarkably,
Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells rapidly up-regulate
Met expression after trastuzumab treatment, promoting their
own resistance. Our study suggests that a subset of Her2 (+)
patients may benefit from combined inhibition of Her2 and
Met. [Cancer Res 2008;68(5):1471–7]

Introduction
Overexpression and aberrant activation of members of the ErbB
family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK), including epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ErbB1, Her2/Neu/ErbB2, ErbB3/
Her3, and ErbB4, are frequently observed in human cancer and
contribute to aggressive tumor behavior and poor patient
prognosis. Members of this receptor family both homodimerize
and heterodimerize in response to ligand binding, generating an
elaborate signaling network that drives key cellular events,
including proliferation, motility, and survival. Her2 enjoys a unique
position in this hierarchy as the preferred dimerization partner.
Notably, Her2 intensifies and prolongs the signaling of heterodimers into which it is incorporated through augmented ligand
affinity and enhanced receptor recycling (1).
Her2 is amplified and/or overexpressed in 20% to 30% of invasive
human breast cancers and is associated with reduced disease-free
and overall survival. The development of trastuzumab (Herceptin),
a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular juxtamembrane domain of Her2, has transformed the
management of breast cancer. It represents the first Her2-targeted
therapy and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in
1996 for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer (2). Subsequent

studies combining trastuzumab with taxanes showed a survival
benefit compared with antibody monotherapy for patients with
metastatic disease (2, 3). Trastuzumab has recently been evaluated
in patients with Her2 (+) early breast cancer and has been found
to decrease the risk of relapse by 50% and prolong survival when
added to chemotherapy (4). Despite these successes, resistance
to trastuzumab therapy, both primary and acquired, remains a
significant clinical problem. Primary resistance to single-agent
trastuzumab ranges from 66% to 88% and from 20% to 50% for
combination therapy. Moreover, most patients that experience a
response will show evidence of disease progression within 1 year
(2–4).
Several mechanisms of action have been put forth for
trastuzumab and, while no one mechanism is universally accepted,
several consistent observations have been made. Initial studies
pointed toward an antibody-induced down-regulation of Her2;
subsequent studies have confirmed that trastuzumab impairs
downstream signaling but the effect on Her2 stability is unclear (2).
In any event, diminished downstream signaling through Her2
leads to the stabilization of p27kip1, a Cdk2 inhibitor, leading to an
antibody-induced G1 cell cycle arrest. Trastuzumab has also been
reported to block shedding of the Her2 extracellular domain, which
leaves behind a constitutively active membrane fragment termed
p95, as well as inhibit tumor angiogenesis through the suppression
of angiogenic factor expression (2, 4). Antibody-dependent cellular
cytotoxicity seems to play a significant role in the efficacy of
trastuzumab in preclinical models but its role in immune
compromised patients is unclear (2).
A number of studies have led to the identification of factors
associated with inherent or treatment-acquired trastuzumab
resistance. PTEN depletion in vitro and in vivo leads to
trastuzumab resistance, and patients whose tumors display
activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway have
a lower response rate and an increased risk of progression while
on trastuzumab-containing combination therapy (5, 6). Importantly, the addition of PI3K inhibitors restores trastuzumab
sensitivity to PTEN-depleted breast cancer cells (7). Activation of
other ErbB family members, such as EGFR, through receptor or
ligand overexpression counteracts the growth inhibitory properties
of trastuzumab, and inclusion of an EGFR inhibitor restores growth
suppression (8–10). Cross-talk between Her2 and the unrelated
RTK, the insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) receptor, rescues cells
from trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition. Inhibition of
IGF-I receptor with an antireceptor antibody or an IGF-IR–specific
tyrosine kinase inhibitor sensitizes resistant cells to trastuzumab
(11–14). The common theme that emerges from these studies is the
reversal of resistance by a multitargeting approach, suggesting that
patients could benefit if such a strategy were used. These studies
also suggest that it will be important to categorize tumors based
not only on Her2 status but also on the status of ‘‘resistance
factors.’’ This will require a highly individualized analysis but
should ultimately improve patient response.

Cancer Research

The Met RTK and its ligand, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
are frequently overexpressed in breast cancer and correlate with
decreased relapse-free and overall survival (15–20). Indeed, Met
receptor overexpression is an independent predictor of poor
prognosis in breast cancer (21–23). A recent immunohistochemical
study of Her2 (+) breast tumors found that a subset (5 of 20) were
strongly positive for Met receptor expression (24). This is of
particular importance as Met and Her2 have been shown to
synergize in promoting cellular invasion, suggesting that tumors
that express both receptors may be more aggressive (25). From a
therapeutic standpoint, the expression of other tyrosine kinases in
Her2 (+) tumors may provide tumor cells with an ‘‘escape hatch.’’
In the face of Her2 inhibition, such tumors may shift their growth
dependence from Her2 to other available tyrosine kinases or may
be less dependent on Her2 to begin with, vastly influencing the
response to Her2-targeted therapy. For example, colorectal cancer
cells develop resistance to the anti-EGFR therapeutic antibody
Cetuximab by using Src-mediated signaling to bypass their
dependency on EGFR for growth (26).
In this study, we consider whether the Met receptor contributes
to trastuzumab resistance of Her2 (+) breast tumor cells. We show
that attenuation of Met activity leads to sensitization to trastuzumab treatment, whereas Met activation protects cells from
the growth inhibitory effects of trastuzumab by preventing
trastuzumab-induced p27 induction. In addition, we show that
Met is coexpressed along with Her2 in Her2-overexpressing breast
cancer cells, as well as Her2 (+) clinical breast cancer samples,
emphasizing the potential translational relevance of our findings.

Materials and Methods
Reagents and cell culture. Human cell lines MDA-MB-361, BT474,
and SKBR3 were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and
cultured in recommended media in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS; Invitrogen) and penicillin-streptomycin antibiotics (Mediatech).
Serum-starved media contained just 0.1% FBS. HGF was purchased from
RDI/Fitzgerald, and neuregulin-1h was produced as described (27).
Antibodies used here include anti-Met C12 and anti-p27 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology); anti–phosphorylated p44/42 MapK [phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)], anti–phosphorylated AKT S473, and
anti–phosphorylated Met Y1349 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA);
anti-actin AC15 (Sigma); and anti-Her2 Ab3 (EMD Biosciences). Trastuzumab was purchased from Genentech.
Human breast tissue analysis and Western blot. Frozen human breast
tissues with pathology reports were obtained from the National Cancer
Institute Cooperative Human Tissue Network.1 All samples were deidentified, and the study was approved by the institutional review board of the
School of Medicine, University of California at Davis. Her2, ER, and PR
status was obtained from the accompanying pathology reports. Samples
were homogenized on ice in 10 AL of T-PER (Pierce)/mg of tissue in the
presence of 4 Ag/mL leupeptin, 4 Ag/mL pepstatin, 4 Ag/mL aprotinin, and
100 nmol/L ABESF and then centrifuged to remove insoluble products.
Protein expression was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.
Blots were incubated first with primary antibodies and next with
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Zymed Laboratories), followed by developing with SuperSignal West chemicals (Pierce).
An Alpha Innotech imaging station with FluorChem software was used to
capture images.
Analysis of combined Her2 and Met activation. SKBR3 cells were
plated at 2.5  104 cells into 24-well plates and allowed to settle overnight

and then serum-starved for 24 h. They were then treated with 1.5 nmol/L
HGF, 5 nmol/L neuregulin or 1.5 nmol/L HGF, and 5 nmol/L neuregulin
for 48 h. An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay was conducted as described (28) to measure cellular
proliferation. Additionally, cells were plated at 2.5  105 cells per well in
12-well plates to measure downstream signaling. After settling, cells were
treated with serum-starved media overnight. Wells were then treated in the
presence or absence of 5 nmol/L neuregulin or 1.5 nmol/L HGF in serumstarved media for the indicated times. Whole-cell lysates were collected and
analyzed via Western blot.
Data analysis for microarray expression. Publicly available microarray
data2 from U133 Plus 2.0 Affymetrix Gene Array analysis of Her2 (+) tumors
was queried, and normalization of data was conducted using dCHIP
software (29, 30). Within this data set, 3 of 22 tumors were identified as
nonresponsive (lack of response or relapse within 6 months).
Growth inhibition analysis. SKBR3 and BT474 cells were plated at
2.5  104 cells per well in 24-well plates and allowed to settle for 24 h. For
Met knockdown experiments, cells were then treated with 100 nmol/L of
On-Target Plus siControl nontargeting pool small interfering RNA (siRNA)
or On-Target Plus Met targeting pool siRNA per manufacturer’s directions
(Dharmacon). After 48 h, cells were serum-starved in the presence and
absence of 21 Ag/mL trastuzumab and allowed to incubate with the drug
for 24 h. An MTT assay was then conducted to measure cell proliferation.
For Met inhibition experiments, 24 h after plating, cells were treated with
1 Amol/L (3Z)-N-(3-chlorophenyl)-3-({3,5-dimethyl-4-[(4-methylpiperazin-1yl)carbonyl]-1H-pyrrol-2-yl}methylene)-N -methyl-2-oxo-2,3-dihydro-1Hindole-5-sulfonamide (SU11274; EMD Biosciences) in the presence or
absence of 21 Ag/mL trastuzumab for 48 h before cell proliferation was
measured via MTT. Results are the average of four replicates performed in
three independent experiments with representative experiments shown.
Met knockdown and inhibition was confirmed by Western blot analysis of
whole-cell lysates.
Isobologram analysis. Isobologram analysis was conducted as described by Menendez et al. (31). To examine the interaction between

of SU11274 and a range of trastuzumab concentrations to empirically
determine the complimentary concentration of trastuzumab necessary to
achieve 20% inhibition. Each point on the graph represents the average of
duplicates. Percentage inhibition was determined using the MTT analysis
48 h after treatment with drugs.
Real-time PCR. Total RNA was harvested from SKBR3 cells using Trizol
followed by the Micro-to-Midi Total RNA Purification System (Invitrogen).
High-capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems) was
used to convert 5 Ag RNA into cDNA. Real-time analysis was conducted
using Applied Biosystems TaqMan Gene expression primers and probes
which were labeled with FAM and EuroGentec Two-Step qRT-PCR Master
Mix on a Bio-Rad iCycler iQ Real-Time PCR instrument.

Results
Met and Her2 are coexpressed in Her2 (+) cell lines and
tumors. A recent immunohistochemical study reported the robust
coexpression of Met in a subset of Her2 (+) breast tumors [5 of 20
Her2 (+) tumors; ref. 24]. To investigate this further, we examined
the expression of Met in a panel of Her2 (+) breast cancer cell lines
and primary breast tumors by Western blot analysis. As shown in
Fig. 1A, analysis of three Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cell
lines (SKBR3, BT474, and MDA-MB-361) shows that Met is
expressed to varying degrees in all three lines. We next examined
the expression of Met in Her2 (+) primary breast tumors. As shown
in Fig. 1B, Met is expressed to varying degrees in the majority of
this collection of Her2 (+) breast tumors. Three tumors showed low
to moderate Met expression, and four tumors showed high to very
high levels of expression. These results are in agreement with the
immunohistochemical study and indicate that Met and Her2 are
frequently coexpressed in breast cancer, providing an opportunity
for cross-talk between the two receptors.
Combined activation of Her2 and Met provides breast
cancer cells with a growth advantage. Her2-overexpressing
breast cancer cells generally display constitutive Her2 tyrosine
phosphorylation, signaling pathway activation, and a high rate of
basal cellular growth. Despite this, growth factor stimulation can
further promote tumor cell proliferation (9) and RTKs are
frequently found overexpressed along with their cognate ligands.
Indeed, growth factor availability regulates several key aspects of
tumor cell behavior, including therapeutic response (8). To
determine whether the activation of Met enhances the growth of
Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells, SKBR3 cells were treated
with HGF, a ligand for the Met receptor, or neuregulin-1h, a ligand
for Her3, the dimeric partner of Her2. As shown in Fig. 2A,
treatment of SKBR3 cells with either HGF or neuregulin-1h resulted
in a modest but reproducible growth response, whereas treatment
with both growth factors led to an additive increase in cellular
proliferation. This was paralleled in the activation of downstream
signaling pathways as shown in Fig. 2B. HGF stimulation led to
a rapid but transient phosphorylation of AKT and p42 ERK,
whereas neuregulin-1h resulted in a delayed but sustained
phosphorylation of these signaling molecules. The combination
of the two growth factors yielded the most robust phosphorylation,
which was both rapid and sustained. These results indicate that
Met activation enhances the growth of Her2-overexpressing cells
and that the combined stimulation of Her2 and Met further
promotes growth.

sion analysis of resistant tumors, defined as those that did not
respond or relapsed within 6 months of therapy, identified several
genes that differed in expression from the remaining tumors. Of
22 Her2 (+) tumors, three were found to be resistant. Analysis of
the publicly available dataset2 shows that HGF and Met expression
is significantly increased in the resistant tumors. The average
increase in expression in the resistant tumors compared with
responsive tumors is f1.5-fold for HGF and 2.0 fold for Met
receptor (Fig. 2C). These data suggest that Met receptor signaling
may play a role in Trastuzumab resistance. However, because these
patients were treated with combination therapy, more defined
experiments are necessary to implicate Met in trastuzumab
resistance specifically, as described below.

treatment; however, the extent of inhibition is modest and typically
ranges from 20% to 40% (33). This suggests that these cells are
either not completely dependent on Her2 for their growth or that
they are capable of rapid adaptation, allowing them to bypass some
of the effects of trastuzumab treatment. Met and Her2 activate
many of the same downstream signaling pathways that may allow
for growth and survival signaling to persist in the face of Her2
inhibition, decreasing the efficacy of targeted agents, such as
trastuzumab.
To determine whether the expression of Met might lessen the
response of Her2 (+) breast cancer cells to trastuzumab, Met was
depleted by siRNA, and the proliferative response of BT474 (top)
and SKBR3 (bottom) cells to trastuzumab was examined. As shown
in Fig. 3A, treatment of cells with trastuzumab and control RNA
interference led to 25% to 30% inhibition of growth, in agreement
with previous reports. Treatment of cells with trastuzumab and
Met-specific RNA interference significantly increased the response
of both cell lines, leading to 40% to 45% inhibition of growth.
To further implicate Met in trastuzumab resistance, cells were
treated with a small molecule inhibitor of Met, SU11274 (Fig. 3B).
SU11274 is an ATP-competitive inhibitor with f10-fold selectivity
for Met compared with other tyrosine kinases; however, it should
be noted that only a subset of tyrosine kinases have been tested
(34, 35). Met was constitutively phosphorylated in both SKBR3 and
BT474 cells, and treatment with SU11274 significantly decreased

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (5). March 1, 2008

this phosphorylation (Fig. 3B, right). The combination of trastuzumab and SU11274 was more efficient at inhibiting the growth of
BT474 and SKBR3 cells than trastuzumab alone (Fig. 3B), and
isobologram analysis showed a synergistic interaction between
the two agents (Fig. 3C). Collectively, these data show that Met
expression and activity can modulate the response of Her2 (+)
breast cancer cells to trastuzumab and that inhibition of Met
sensitizes cells to trastuzumab therapy.
To examine the mechanism by which Met contributes to
trastuzumab resistance, the activation status of downstream
signaling pathways was evaluated. BT474 (Fig. 4A) and SKBR3
(Fig. 4B) cells were treated with trastuzumab alone or a
combination of trastuzumab and SU11274 and the activation of
the PI3K/AKT and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways
were examined by Western blotting with phosphorylated specific
antibodies. As shown in Fig. 4, treatment of cells with trastuzumab
diminished downstream signaling, as expected; however, residual
phosphorylation of AKT and ERK was readily detected. By
comparison, treatment of cells with trastuzumab and SU11274
significantly improved the impairment of downstream signaling.
These results indicate that growth and survival signaling persist
in the presence of trastuzumab in large part due to Met activity.
Indeed, Met inhibition alone significantly inhibited AKT and ERK
phosphorylation, demonstrating that Met contributes to constitutive activation of signaling pathways in Her2-overexpressing breast

Trastuzumab Resistance

cancer cells. However, it should be noted that the activity of
SU11274 toward other kinases may contribute to the decline in
AKT and ERK phosphorylation. A significant decrease in phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated Erk was also observed with
Met knockdown (data not shown), supporting the interpretation
that Met plays an important role in AKT and ERK phosphorylation
in these cells. Met inhibition may improve trastuzumab efficacy
in Her2 (+) breast tumors through enhanced inhibition of key
downstream signaling pathways. This finding has important
clinical implications, as a significant percentage of Her2 (+) breast
cancers express Met (Fig. 1B).
Ligand-mediated activation of Met protects cells from
trastuzumab. Because Met depletion or inhibition improves the
response to trastuzumab, we next examined whether Met activation
by HGF protects cells from trastuzumab. HGF is normally expressed
in the mesenchyme and acts in a paracrine manner to stimulate
epithelial cells expressing Met. In breast cancer, HGF is frequently
overexpressed and is an independent predictor of recurrence and
poor survival (19). To examine the effect of HGF on the response to
trastuzumab, SKBR3 cells were treated with trastuzumab without
and with HGF. Growth inhibition relative to untreated cells was
quantified as shown in Fig. 5A. HGF abrogated the growth
inhibitory response to trastuzumab. To examine the mechanism
by which HGF protects cells from trastuzumab, expression of the
cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27 was examined by Western
blotting. Trastuzumab-mediated inhibition of AKT signaling leads
to p27 stabilization, and this accumulation is crucial for antibodyinduced G1 arrest and growth inhibition (36). As shown in Fig. 5B,
treatment of BT474 cells with trastuzumab increased p27 expression, as expected. Treatment with trastuzumab in the presence of

treatment and analyzed for phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated Erk, and actin
content by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot.

HGF abrogated p27 induction. Similar results were observed in
SKBR3 cells (data not shown). These results indicate that ligandmediated activation of Met receptor protects cells from trastuzumab-mediated growth inhibition by preventing the induction of the
key cell cycle inhibitor p27.
Her2 (+) breast cancer cells up-regulate Met receptor during
trastuzumab treatment. Analysis of publicly available microarray
data (Fig. 2C) indicates that Met receptor transcript is elevated in
tumors resistant to trastuzumab and vinorelbine therapy. A
separate study examining mechanisms of acquired resistance to
trastuzumab found that resistant cells express elevated levels of
EGFR message (10), suggesting that tumor cells recognize their
‘‘plight’’ during trastuzumab therapy and may respond by upregulating growth and survival pathways. In vitro models of
acquired resistance are treated continually with trastuzumab for
weeks to months at which time resistant clones are isolated and
analyzed for changes that contribute to resistance. We reasoned
that Her2 (+) breast cancer cells may have inherent protective
mechanisms that are deployed rapidly (hours to days) upon
initiation of trastuzumab therapy. We therefore examined Met
expression in BT474 (Fig. 6A) and SKBR3 (Fig. 6B) cells after
treatment with trastuzumab. SKBR3 cells were isolated in 1970
from a pleural effusion,3 whereas BT474 cells were isolated in 1978
from an invasive ductal carcinoma (37). Both cell lines predate the
development of trastuzumab and are naive to trastuzumab

treatment. Remarkably, within 48 h of trastuzumab treatment,
there was a significant increase in Met protein expression in both
cell lines. This increase in protein expression was accompanied by
a 1.5-fold increase in Met transcript levels as revealed by real-time
PCR analysis of SKBR3 cells (Fig. 6C). These results indicate that
Her2 (+) breast cancer cells respond to trastuzumab treatment with
a rapid up-regulation of Met receptor expression, which in turn
promotes trastuzumab resistance through the sustained activation
of downstream signaling pathways.

Discussion
The development of targeted therapies, such as tamoxifen and
trastuzumab, has had a major effect on the clinical management of
breast cancer, improving disease-free and overall patient survival,
whereas lessening deleterious side effects. The premise of targeted
therapy, the absolute dependence of a tumor on a single oncogene
or ‘‘oncogene addiction’’ is supported by both preclinical and
clinical evidence (38). The best example of this is given by the
success of Gleevec, which targets the Bcr-Abl oncogene in chronic
myelogenous leukemia (39). However, the vulnerability of targeted
therapy lies in its very basis: the exquisite specificity of targeted
agents leaves open multiple avenues by which tumors may evade
therapy enabling therapeutic resistance. Indeed, tumors clearly
escape oncogene addiction as the success with Gleevec is the
exception rather than the rule.
Resistance to trastuzumab, both inherent and acquired, presents
a significant barrier to the effective treatment of Her2 (+) breast
cancer and has been the focus of numerous studies (3–14). The
theme that has emerged underscores the importance of key
downstream signaling pathways, particularly the PI3K/AKT
pathway, in promoting resistance (6, 7). Coexpression of RTKs,
such as EGFR (8–10) or IGF-IR (11–14), or loss of the negative
regulator PTEN (5–7) allows PI3K/AKT signaling to be sustained
despite Her2 inhibition. In other words, redundancy in mechanisms of AKT activation is one way by which trastuzumab
resistance may be achieved. Presumably, coexpression of any
number of RTKs could support this resistance; however, such
studies must be grounded in the analysis of clinical samples to
determine which kinases are coexpressed with Her2 in vivo.
Interestingly, Met may also be a player in IGF-IR–mediated
trastuzumab resistance, as Met is required for some IGF-IR–driven
cellular responses (40, 41).
In this manuscript, we identify Met as an RTK that is frequently
coexpressed with Her2 in Her2 (+) breast cancer and contributes to

through sustained AKT activation. Loss of Met function, either
through RNA interference–mediated depletion or small molecule–
mediated inhibition, significantly improves the response to
trastuzumab; conversely, Met activation protects cells against
trastuzumab. Significantly, Her2-overexpressing breast cancer cells
respond to trastuzumab treatment with a rapid up-regulation of
Met receptor expression, in essence promoting their own
resistance. Met has also been found to be involved in acquired
resistance to the EGFR-targeted agent gefitinib and is amplified in
gefitinib-resistant lung cancer cell lines and tumors (42). The
mechanism of resistance lies in the ability of Met to drive EGFRindependent/ErbB3-dependent PI3K/AKT activation. Met amplification does not seem to be necessary for its role in trastuzumab
resistance, however, as Met is not amplified in any of the cell
models used in this paper.
A hallmark of the evolving nature of targeted therapy lies in the
number of agents that are in phase I or phase II clinical trials,
which inhibit multiple tyrosine kinases.4 With respect to the Met
receptor, there are a number of therapeutics in clinical
development, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, monoclonal
antibodies, and molecular decoys. For example, XL880 (Exelixis),
an orally available small molecule compound currently in phase II
development, targets Met along with the vascular endothelial
growth factor receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor,
c-Kit, Flt3, and Tie2 RTKs. Our studies suggest that some Her2 (+)
patients may benefit from the addition of a Met inhibitor to
trastuzumab therapy. However, this must be approached with
caution, as the combination of the EGFR-targeted agent gefitinib
with trastuzumab was found to be unexpectedly antagonistic
in the clinic (43). Future studies will seek to evaluate whether
Met receptor coexpression predicts a worsened response to
trastuzumab.
