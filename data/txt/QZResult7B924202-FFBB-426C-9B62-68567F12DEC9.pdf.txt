Abstract
Sunitinib is a broad-spectrum small-molecule inhibitor of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) that serves as the
present standard of care for first-line therapy of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). A full understanding of the targets and mechanism of action of sunitinib in ccRCC treatment remains incomplete. In this
study, we evaluated several tumor cell and endothelial targets of sunitinib and investigated which RTK(s) may
specifically contribute to its therapeutic effects. Microarray expression profiling and Western blot analysis revealed that among known sunitinib targets, only platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2) were overexpressed in ccRCCs relative to normal tissues. Sunitinib
was unable to inhibit survival or proliferation of ccRCC cells at pharmacologically relevant concentrations
(∼0.1 μmol/L) that inhibit RTK targets. In contrast, sunitinib inhibited endothelial cell proliferation and motility
at the same concentrations by suppressing VEGFR-2 signaling. Moreover, whereas sunitinib inhibited the growth
of ccRCC xenograft tumors and decreased tumor microvessel density as soon as 12 hours after treatment,
sunitinib showed no significant effects on tumor cell proliferation or apoptosis up to 72 hours after treatment.
Our findings indicate that sunitinib inhibits ccRCC growth primarily through an antiangiogenic mechanism
and not through direct targeting of ccRCC tumor cells. Cancer Res; 70(3); 1053–62. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Sunitinib is a multitargeted inhibitor of receptor tyrosine
kinases (RTK) and has shown clinical efficacy in the treatment of human cancers. It is currently Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of advanced clear cell
renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumors. It is also under intense investigation as a treatment for
several other cancers, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and non–small cell lung cancer (1–4). Sunitinib has been
shown to inhibit the tyrosine kinase activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and
VEGFR-3), platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRα and PDGFR-β), fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), stem
cell growth factor receptor KIT, and RET (5).
The ability of sunitinib to suppress tumor angiogenesis has
been well established. Two of the major targets of sunitinib,
VEGFR and PDGFR, are expressed on endothelial cells and

perivascular cells (pericytes) and play critical roles in angiogenesis. Sunitinib may also have direct antiproliferative and/
or apoptotic effects on tumor cells, which express target kinases. Sunitinib has been shown to directly inhibit the survival and proliferation of a variety of cancer cells, including
small cell lung carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumors,
acute myelogenous leukemia, and chronic myelogenous
monocytic leukemia, which harbored either activating mutations or translocations of the target RTKs or their ligands (1,
3, 4, 6–8). However, direct antitumor effects of sunitinib in
the treatment of ccRCC have not been clearly established.
To date, no somatic mutations in target RTK genes have
been found in human ccRCC (9). Although one recent study
reported apoptotic effects of sunitinib on ccRCC cells in vitro,
the doses observed to inhibit cell survival were far higher
than pharmacologically relevant doses (10). Thus, despite
the efficacy of sunitinib in the treatment of ccRCC, its targets
and complete mechanism of action against ccRCC remain
unclear. In particular, it is unclear whether sunitinib acts primarily through an antiangiogenic mechanism or whether it
may also act to directly target ccRCC tumor cells.
Sunitinib is currently considered the standard of care for
first-line therapy of metastatic ccRCC, a disease that is resistant to traditional chemotherapy and radiotherapy and that
has long had a very poor patient survival rate. Compared
with traditional IFN treatment, sunitinib more than doubles
progression-free survival of metastatic ccRCC (11, 12). However, not all patients respond to sunitinib, and the vast majority eventually develop resistance to sunitinib therapy. A
complete understanding of the mechanisms of sunitinib action
against ccRCC is thus critical in understanding and improving

treatment of this disease. In this study, we evaluated the primary targets of sunitinib in both ccRCC tumor cells and endothelial cells. We determined that, at pharmacologically
relevant concentrations, the primary action of sunitinib in
ccRCC is through an antiangiogenic mechanism and not
through direct targeting of ccRCC cells.

Materials and Methods
Reagents
Sunitinib was provided by Pfizer Global Pharmaceuticals
and was prepared as a 20 mmol/L stock solution in DMSO
(Sigma) for in vitro studies.
Expression of RTKs in Clear Cell RCC
The mRNA expression of RTK-related genes was measured
in 174 clear cell renal tumors and 15 normal kidney samples
using Affymetrix HGU133 Plus 2.0 microarrays, as described
elsewhere (13).
Cells and Cell Culture
ACHN, A-498, and 786-O ccRCC cell lines were obtained
from the American Type Culture Collection. SN12C cells were
kindly provided by Dr. George Vande Woude (Van Andel Research Institute, originally from National Cancer Institute).
The cells were maintained in DMEM or RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen), 100 IU/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin
(Invitrogen) in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2
at 37°C. Human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC)
and human lymphatic microvascular endothelial cells
(HLMVEC) were obtained from Clonetics and maintained
in Clonetics EBM-2 medium supplemented with EGM-2 SingleQuots or EGM-MV SingleQuots (Lonza). All the cell lines
were used within 20 passages.
Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting
Cells were starved in low serum (0.1% FBS) overnight before treatment with sunitinib for 2 h. After treatment, cells
were stimulated with 50 ng/mL recombinant human
PDGF-BB or VEGF165 (R&D Systems) for 10 min. Cells were
then lysed with cold HNTG lysis buffer (50 mmol/L HEPES,
150 mmol/L NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mmol/L
MgCl2, and 1 mmol/L EGTA) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors [10 mmol/L sodium fluoride, 1 mmol/L
sodium orthovanadate, and protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche Diagnostics)], and protein concentration was determined using the detergent-compatible protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). Protein
(1 mg) from each sample was immunoprecipitated overnight
at 4°C with an anti–PDGFR-β (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or
anti–VEGFR-2 (Cell Signaling) antibody and protein G/A agarose beads (Pierce). Immune complexes were washed with
cold HNTG lysis buffer containing inhibitors. Proteins were
eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer, separated by SDSPAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody
(Upstate) and then stripped with stripping buffer. To detect

total PDGFR-β and VEGFR-2 levels, membranes were reprobed with the same anti–PDGFR-β and anti–VEGFR-2 antibody that was used for the immunoprecipitation. Western
blot analysis of phospho–extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 (Cell Signaling), ERK1/2 (Cell Signaling),
phospho-AKT (Cell Signaling), and AKT (Cell Signaling)
was performed on whole-cell lysates (30 μg). β-Actin (Abcam) was used as a loading control.
Ligand-Dependent Cell Proliferation Assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at a density of 3,000 per
well and starved in low serum overnight in a medium containing 0.1% FBS. Cells were treated with sunitinib and stimulated with 50 ng/mL recombinant human PDGF-BB or
PDGF-AA or VEGF165 (R&D Systems) and cultured continuously in the presence of sunitinib for 72 h. Cell viability was
assessed using the MTS assay (Promega). MTS assays were
also performed on RCC cells growing in complete medium
(10% FBS) treated with sunitinib. Results were expressed as
a percentage of viable cells relative to cells treated with
DMSO. Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated at least three times.
Small Interfering RNA Transfection
RCC cells were seeded in 96-well or 6-well plates and,
24 h later, transfected with individual small interfering
RNA (siRNA; Invitrogen) targeting PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, and
VEGFR-1, respectively, using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. At the same time,
nontargeting siRNA (Invitrogen) was transfected as a negative control (Neg-L or Neg-H means with low or high GC content). Twenty-four, 48, and 72 h after transfection, cell
viability was determined using MTS assay, and the knockdown of individual gene was confirmed by Western blotting
72 h after transfection.
Soft Agar Colony Formation Assay
Soft agar colony formation assay was performed as described elsewhere (14). Cells were treated with either sunitinib (0.1, 1, and 5 μmol/L) or 0.1% DMSO (control).
Experiments were performed in triplicate and repeated three
times.
Cell Cycle Analysis
Cells were incubated with either 0.1 μmol/L sunitinib or
DMSO (control) for 72 h. Cells were collected and analyzed
using a cellular DNA flow cytometric analysis kit (Roche Diagnostics). Cell cycle profiles were determined by flow cytometric analysis. Daunorubicin (0.1 μmol/L) was used as a
positive control for cell cycle arrest at G2-M phase.
Endothelial Cell Invasion Assay
Endothelial cell invasion was analyzed using the BD BioCoat endothelial cell invasion system according to the instructions of the manufacturer (BD Biosciences). Briefly,
HUVEC cells (2 × 104) were plated onto the upper well of
the chamber with medium (serum-free) alone with or without sunitinib; the lower chamber contained 50 ng/mL VEGF

(R&D Systems) as a chemoattractant. All experimental samples were set up in duplicate. Cells were incubated at 37°C in
CO2 for 16 to 24 h, and then residual cells on the upper surface of the chamber membranes were removed using a cotton swab. Invaded cells on the lower membrane surface were
visualized by Diff-Quik staining kit (Allegiance) according to
the manufacturer's protocol and examined under the microscope. Pictures of invaded cells were taken for three fields per
well under ×100 magnification, and the number of invaded
cells was counted by ImageJ v1.37v software.
Xenograft Models
Tumor implantation and growth. All animal studies were
in compliance with Van Andel Research Institute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee policies. Six-week-old female BALB/c nu/nu nude mice (Charles River) were given s.c.
injections of 3 × 106 A-498, ACHN, SN12C, or 786-O cells in
the right flank. Tumor size was measured twice per week using digital calipers (Mitutoyo), and tumor volume was calculated as length × width × height × 0.5. Tumor growth ratio is
presented as mean + SD and normalized to the initial volume
when sunitinib treatment began. When tumors had grown to
an average volume of 200 to 300 mm3, tumor-bearing mice
were separated into four groups of 10 animals (two groups
for A-498 and 786-O xenografts). Three treatment groups received an oral gavage of sunitinib as a citrate-buffered (pH
3.5) solution once daily at the dosages of 20, 40, and 80
mg/kg (40 mg/kg for A-498 and 786-O xenografts), respectively. At the same time, one vehicle control group received
citrate buffer (pH 3.5) only. Mice were euthanized at the end
of the treatment period. Tumors were removed and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded, and then 4μm-thick sections were prepared. Some sections were
stained with H&E and the others were used for subsequent
immunohistochemical analysis.
Target modulation study. To determine the mechanism
of action of sunitinib in these ccRCC xenograft models, a
separate study was designed in which sunitinib treatment
was initiated when tumors grew untreated to a size of 400
to 500 mm3. Mice were then administered sunitinib or vehicle control at the indicated concentration once daily for
1 to 4 d. At the indicated time after dosing, individual
mice were sacrificed and tumors were resected and fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde. Microvessel density (MVD) was
determined by CD34 staining in the control- or sunitinibtreated tumor sections. Tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis were also determined by proliferating cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining as
described below.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining for PCNA, TUNEL, and
CD34 was performed as described elsewhere (14). PCNA antibody (Abcam) was used at a dilution of 1:500. TUNEL staining was performed according to the protocol of the
manufacturer (Promega). CD34 (MEC 14.7, Abcam) antibody
was used at a dilution of 1:50. The quantification of MVD,

proliferation index, and apoptosis index was also performed
as described elsewhere (14).
Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as mean ± SD. Values were compared
using Student's t test. P < 0.05 was considered significant.

Results
PDGFR-β and VEGFR-2 are highly expressed in human
ccRCC. To identify potential RTK(s) that would likely be the
targets of sunitinib in ccRCC, we examined the expression
levels of several RTKs, including VEGFR, PDGFR, FLT3, cKIT, and RET, in 174 human ccRCC samples as determined
by gene expression profiling. We found that PDGFR-β and
VEGFR-2, but not others, were highly expressed in human
ccRCC when compared with normal controls (P < 0.001;
Fig. 1A). We also examined the expression and activation
of these RTKs in ccRCC cell lines and endothelial cell lines
by Western blotting. PDGFR-β was expressed by 4 of 12
RCC cell lines, PDGFR-α was expressed by most RCC cell
lines, VEGFR-1 was expressed in almost all RCC and endothelial cell lines, whereas VEGFR-2 was expressed only in
the endothelial cell lines. However, no significant basal activation of these RTKs was detected either in the ccRCC cells
or in the endothelial cells (Fig. 1B; data not shown). FLT3, cKIT, and RET expression were undetectable in all cell lines.
Based on the combination of these data, we focused our
study on PDGFR and VEGFR signaling in these respective
cells.
Sunitinib inhibits RTK signaling pathways in ccRCC
cells in vitro. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
studies have revealed that the pharmacologically relevant
concentration for sunitinib is 50 to 100 ng/mL (0.125–
0.25 μmol/L; refs. 4, 15). To examine the effect of sunitinib
at these concentrations on the activation of PDGFR-β in
ccRCC cells, two PDGFR-β–expressing cell lines, SN12C
and ACHN, were chosen for evaluation in vitro. Sunitinib
decreased PDGF-BB–stimulated phosphorylation of
PDGFR-β at 0.01 μmol/L in both cell lines and completely
inhibited the phosphorylation of PDGFR-β at concentrations ≥0.1 μmol/L (Fig. 1C).
RTKs transduce signals of proliferation, migration, and
survival from the extracellular environment through a series
of downstream signal transduction pathways. The ERK and
AKT kinases are two major downstream effectors of PDGFR
signaling (16, 17). Western blot analysis showed that, in
comparison with DMSO controls, sunitinib inhibited PDGFBB–stimulated activation of ERK and AKT at ∼0.1 μmol/L
(Fig. 1D), the same concentration shown to completely
inhibit activation of PDGFR-β. Because sunitinib shows
similar inhibitory potency (Ki value) on both PDGFR and
VEGFR in biochemical assays (5), we speculate that sunitinib
could inhibit the activation of these RTKs simultaneously at
the above concentrations.
Proliferation of ccRCC cells is not affected by sunitinib
at concentrations that inhibit RTK signaling. To further explore the role of PDGFR and VEGFR signaling pathways in

ccRCC cells in vitro, cancer cells were serum starved and then
PDGFR and VEGFR signaling pathways were activated with
PDGF and VEGF. The IC50 for sunitinib to inhibit PDGF- or
VEGF-dependent proliferation of ccRCC cells was 4 to 10
μmol/L, which is much higher than the concentration of sunitinib sufficient to inhibit RTK phosphorylation (0.01–0.1
μmol/L). Sunitinib showed similar effects on proliferation
of ccRCC cells in PDGF- or VEGF-only medium and in complete medium (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). This indicates that inhibition of the PDGFR and VEGFR signaling
pathways is not sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of
ccRCC cells in vitro. To our surprise, PDGF or VEGF alone
did not induce the proliferation of ccRCC cells after serum
starvation (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1B), although PDGF
has been reported to stimulate the proliferation of PDGFRtransfected NIH-3T3 cells (4). Cell cycle analysis also showed
no change in cell cycle progression after sunitinib treatment
compared with DMSO controls (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Knockdown of PDGFR and VEGFR does not affect proliferation of ccRCC cells. Based on the above findings, we hypothesized that the effect of sunitinib on ccRCC is not

attributable to the direct targeting of ccRCC cells. To test this
hypothesis, we further examined the effect of knockdown of
PDGFR and VEGFR on the proliferation of ccRCC cells using
siRNA in vitro. Knockdown of individual PDGFR or VEGFR
isoforms did not affect the proliferation of ccRCC cells compared with the nontargeting siRNA controls (negative; Fig.
2C; Supplementary Fig. S3).
Sunitinib inhibits anchorage-independent growth of
ccRCC cells at higher concentrations. Because anchorageindependent growth is a characteristic of transformed cells,
we next used a soft agar colony formation assay to evaluate
whether sunitinib could reverse malignant properties of
ccRCC cells at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Although sunitinib significantly inhibited the anchorage-independent colony formation of ACHN and A-498 cells at 5
μmol/L (P < 0.01), it showed weak effects at 1 μmol/L and
no effect at 0.1 μmol/L (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S4).
Sunitinib inhibits VEGFR-2–mediated endothelial cell
growth and invasion in vitro. Because VEGFR has been
found important for tumor angiogenesis and is expressed
in tumor-associated endothelial cells, we next investigated

the effect of sunitinib on endothelial cell lines in vitro.
First, we examined the expression of the RTKs in five human endothelial cell lines. VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were
highly expressed in those cell lines; in contrast, PDGFR expression was weak or undetectable (Fig. 1B). Analogous to
its effect on PDGFR activation in ccRCC cell lines, sunitinib could inhibit the phosphorylation of VEGFR in
HLMVEC cells at concentrations between 0.01 and 0.1
μmol/L (Fig. 4A). In addition, ERK signaling downstream
of VEGFR was also inhibited by sunitinib at this concentration [VEGFR-mediated activation of AKT (Ser473) was
undetectable in our system]. Compared with ccRCC tumor
cells, sunitinib showed more robust inhibitory effect on the
proliferation of HUVEC and HLMVEC endothelial cells.
IC50 values on endothelial cell lines under VEGF-dependent
conditions were ∼0.01 μmol/L, which was similar to the
concentrations required to inhibit activation of VEGFR-2
(Fig. 4B). We further found that after serum starvation,
VEGF alone could induce the proliferation of endothelial
cells (Fig. 4C). At pharmacologically relevant concentration,
sunitinib also inhibited VEGF-induced endothelial cell invasion (Fig. 4D). These results show that VEGFR signaling is
required for proliferation and invasion of endothelial cells
and that inhibition of VEGFR signaling with sunitinib suppresses the function of endothelial cells. Thus, all the
above results indicate that at pharmacologically relevant
concentrations, sunitinib may primarily target tumor endothelium rather than ccRCC cells in vivo.
Sunitinib inhibits RCC xenograft tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. To investigate the effect of sunitinib in vivo and the effect of VHL status on response to
sunitinib, mice bearing tumor xenografts of ccRCC cell

lines were treated with sunitinib. Four ccRCC cell lines
were chosen for xenograft study: A-498 and 786-O cells
contain loss of heterozygosity VHL, whereas ACHN and
SN12C cells harbor wild-type VHL. Sunitinib treatment
showed either growth inhibition (40 mg/kg) or stasis (80
mg/kg) effects on SN12C xenografts (data not shown),
whereas sunitinib treatment caused stasis effects at 40
mg/kg on A-498 and 786-O xenografts and induced growth
inhibition at 20 mg/kg and regression at 40 and 80 mg/kg
for ACHN xenografts (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Fig. S5A).
Quantification of tumor MVD at the end of sunitinib treatment showed that MVD was significantly decreased in
sunitinib-treated tumors compared with vehicle controls
(Fig. 5B; Supplementary Fig. S5B).
Sunitinib primarily inhibits ccRCC tumor angiogenesis
but not ccRCC cells in vivo. To further elucidate the mechanism of sunitinib-mediated growth inhibition or stasis effect
in vivo, we collected tumor samples treated with sunitinib for
24 to 96 hours and examined the effect of sunitinib on tumor
vasculature as well as ccRCC cell proliferation and apoptosis.
In A-498 xenografts, tumor MVD was significantly inhibited
by sunitinib as soon as 12 hours after treatment compared
with vehicle-treated controls (Fig. 6A; also see results for
SN12C xenografts in Supplementary Fig. S6A). The percentage of PCNA-positive cells (shown as proliferation index) and
the percentage of TUNEL-positive cells (shown as apoptosis
index) in the viable tumor section did not significantly alter
up to 72 hours after sunitinib treatment when compared
with vehicle controls (Fig. 6B; also see results for SN12C xenografts in Supplementary Fig. S6B). This result suggests that
the inhibitory effect of sunitinib on xenograft tumor growth
in vivo was not caused by direct targeting of ccRCC cells. The

inhibition of endothelial cell function by sunitinib in vitro
and the reduction of MVD in the sunitinib-treated tumors
in vivo indicate that the antitumor effect of sunitinib is mainly mediated by inhibition of tumor angiogenesis.

Discussion
Sunitinib is currently considered first-line therapy for the
treatment of advanced ccRCC. However, the relationship between clinical efficacy of sunitinib on ccRCC and its mechanism of action has not been established. To study this
problem, we directly examined the effect and action of sunitinib on ccRCC cells and endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo
at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. Our studies indicate that sunitinib inhibits ccRCC growth primarily
through an antiangiogenic mechanism and not through direct targeting of ccRCC tumor cells.
A recent study by Xin and colleagues (10) reported that
sunitinib induces apoptosis in ccRCC cells through inhibition
of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3. However, Xin and colleagues found that the IC50 values required to
inhibit ccRCC cell viability and proliferation in vitro were in
the range of 5 μmol/L and above, >50 times the concentra-

tion of sunitinib required to inhibit RTK signaling in our cell
lines (0.01–0.1 μmol/L; see Fig. 1). Other groups have also reported that sunitinib concentrations much lower than 5
μmol/L are sufficient to inhibit RTK signaling. In cellular assays, Mendel and colleagues (4) found that sunitinib inhibited ligand-dependent phosphorylation of VEGFR-2 and
PDGFR-β with IC50 values of ∼0.01 μmol/L, consistent with
our own findings. Finally, both clinical and preclinical pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic studies indicate that
pharmacologically and clinically relevant plasma concentrations of sunitinib are in the range of 50 to 100 ng/mL or 0.1 to
0.2 μmol/L (4, 15). Thus, we believe that the high concentrations of sunitinib (∼5 μmol/L), which Xin and colleagues
observed to inhibit proliferation and viability of ccRCC cells,
are likely not pharmacologically or clinically relevant.
In our study, we observed that pharmacologically relevant
concentrations of sunitinib (∼0.1 μmol/L) did not affect the
viability or proliferation of ccRCC cell lines in vitro. In contrast, sunitinib did inhibit endothelial cell proliferation and
invasion and did so at concentrations that also inhibited

tumor angiogenesis in vivo but did not affect the proliferation
or apoptosis of ccRCC tumor cells. Together, these data indicate that sunitinib acts primarily to target tumor vasculature
rather than tumor cells in the treatment of ccRCC.
Our analysis of RTK expression in ccRCC suggested that
PDGFR and VEGFR were likely relevant targets of sunitinib
in the treatment of ccRCC. PDGFR-β and VEGFR-2 were
both overexpressed in human ccRCC tumor samples compared with normal tissue. Analysis of ccRCC and endothelial
cell lines found that, of the known sunitinib-sensitive RTKs,
only PDGFR-α, PDGFR-β, and VEGFR-1 were expressed by
ccRCC cells, whereas VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were highly expressed by endothelial cells. Overexpression of c-KIT has
been shown in chromophobe RCC and renal oncocytoma
but not ccRCC (18, 19). Although higher PDGFR-α expression
has been correlated with RCC progression (20, 21), our in vitro
studies showed that inhibition of PDGFR signaling (by either
sunitinib treatment or siRNA knockdown of PDGFR expres-

sion) was not sufficient to inhibit the proliferation of ccRCC
cells. Knockdown of VEGFR-1 expression in ccRCC cells also
failed to inhibit proliferation. Thus, PDGFR and VEGFR-1 signaling in ccRCC cells are likely redundant growth signaling
pathways. In contrast, we found that VEGFR signaling is required for the proliferation of endothelial cells. Sunitinib inhibited phosphorylation of VEGFR- and VEGF-dependent
proliferation of endothelial cells at similar concentrations
(0.01 μmol/L), indicating the important role of VEGFR signaling for proliferation of endothelial cells.
Although PDGFR signaling may not be required for growth
of ccRCC cells, it has been shown as a requirement for the survival of pericytes, perivascular cells surrounding newly formed
blood vessels, in several cancer types (22–24). In the neovascularization process, endothelial cells secrete growth factors that
recruit pericytes to the newly formed blood vessel to stabilize
and mature the vascular network. PDGF-B is expressed by
sprouting capillary endothelial cells, whereas its receptor

Mechanism of Action for Sunitinib in ccRCC

Figure 6. Target modulation study shows that sunitinib primarily acts on tumor endothelium rather than via direct targeting of ccRCC cells in vivo.
A, sunitinib inhibited A-498 xenograft tumor angiogenesis as soon as 12 h after treatment. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01. B, sunitinib showed minimal effect on
A-498 tumor cell proliferation and did not induce apoptosis of A-498 cells up to 72 h after treatment in vivo.

PDGFR-β is localized on pericytes, suggesting a paracrine signaling circuit between the two cell types (25–27). Although sunitinib does not affect the proliferation of ccRCC cells, our
preliminary results indicate that it might inhibit pericytes survival through PDGFR suppression (Supplementary Fig. S7) and
contribute to the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Further
studies are needed to validate this hypothesis.
Mutations in the VHL gene are associated with the majority of ccRCC tumors (28). We did not see a correlation between VHL mutational status and response to sunitinib.
We assessed the effect of sunitinib on four ccRCC xenografts
(two with VHL−/− and two with VHL+/+). The most sensitive
xenograft was the VHL+/+ ACHN (40 mg/kg sunitinib causes
regression). The mid-sensitive xenografts were A-498 and
786-O (VHL−/−; 40 mg/kg sunitinib causes stasis effect). The
least sensitive xenograft was SN12C (VHL+/+; 40 mg/kg sunitinib causes growth inhibition). The lack of correlation between VHL mutational status and response to sunitinib
therapy is consistent with clinical observations. In a retrospective analysis of ccRCC patients, Choueiri and colleagues
(29) found that VHL mutation status had little effect on
patient response to sunitinib therapy; response rates of
VHL-mutated and VHL wild-type ccRCC patients to sunitinib
therapy were 56% and 52%, respectively.
In summary, we found that, under pharmacologically relevant concentrations, sunitinib targets the ccRCC tumor endothelium and not ccRCC cells directly. To our knowledge, this
is the first study to clearly show that the clinical efficacy of
sunitinib on ccRCC is mediated primarily through an antian-

giogenic effect and also not through direct targeting of ccRCC
cells. This understanding of sunitinib action should have important implications for the improved treatment of ccRCC.
