ABSTRACT
We recently reported that Fhit is in a molecular complex with annexin A4
(ANXA4); following to their binding, Fhit delocalizes ANXA4 from plasma membrane to
cytosol in paclitaxel-resistant lung cancer cells, thus restoring their chemosensitivity
to the drug. Here, we demonstrate that Fhit physically interacts with A4 through its
N-terminus; molecular dynamics simulations were performed on a 3D Fhit model
to rationalize its mechanism of action. This approach allowed for the identification
of the QHLIKPS heptapeptide (position 7 to 13 of the wild-type Fhit protein) as the
smallest Fhit sequence still able to preserve its ability to bind ANXA4. Interestingly,
Fhit peptide also recapitulates the property of the native protein in inhibiting Annexin
A4 translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane in A549 and Calu-2 lung cancer
cells treated with paclitaxel. Finally, the combination of Tat-Fhit peptide and paclitaxel
synergistically increases the apoptotic rate of cultured lung cancer cells and blocks
in vivo tumor formation.
Our findings address to the identification of chemically simplified Fhit derivatives
that mimic Fhit tumor suppressor functions; intriguingly, this approach might lead to
the generation of novel anticancer drugs to be used in combination with conventional
therapies in Fhit-negative tumors to prevent or delay chemoresistance.

INTRODUCTION

the most fragile locus in epithelial cells [3], FHIT loss is
commonly reported in human tumors of this derivation as
an early event [4], not only through genetic inactivation
(i.e., deletions and translocations) [5] but also through the
silencing of its promoter due to hypermethylation [6].

The FHIT gene encompasses the most common
fragile site, FRA3B at 3p14.2 [1, 2] in human
lymphoblasts; interestingly, although this region is not

RESULTS

Several evidences pointed at FHIT as a tumor
suppressor gene; in fact, its genetic ablation in mice
results both in an increase of spontaneous tumors and
in a much higher susceptibility to develop carcinogeninduced tumors than wild-type counterparts [7]. Moreover,
FHIT overexpression driven in vivo through recombinant
viral vectors, prevented tumor development in Fhit
knock-out mice [8, 9]. Furthermore, FHIT restoration in
FHIT-negative cancer cells of both epithelial origin and
leukemias blocks in vivo tumor formation and triggers
caspase-mediated apoptosis [10-12].
FHIT is one of the genes mostly involved in human
tumorigenesis; however, regardless of the efforts, Fhit
function still remains largely obscure. FHIT encodes for
an enzyme whose in vivo substrate has not been identified
yet; however, in cell free assays its product hydrolizes
diadenosine polyphosphate substrates, preferentially
diadenosine triphosphate (Ap3A) but also diadenosine
tetraphosphate (Ap4A) [13, 14]. The design of mutant
alleles of FHIT proved that only mutants still binding
the substrate could, at least partially, retain the ability to
trigger apoptosis of Fhit-negative cancer cells [15, 16].
Only recently, we begun to shed lights about the molecular
pathways involving Fhit protein activity. In fact, Hsp60
and Hsp10 take Fhit protein into the mitochondrion where
it binds some mitochondrial proteins, including Fdxr; this
protein complex induces the generation of reactive oxygen
species (ROS) which, in turn, triggers apoptosis of Fhitnegative cancer cells [17]. As Fhit protein is virtually
ubiquitously distributed into the cell [17, 18], later on
we tried to isolate novel Fhit partners with oncogenic
activity starting from cell membranes; we successfully
identified annexin A4 (ANXA4) [19], a protein
belonging to a superfamily of calcium-regulated and
phospholipid membrane-binding proteins [20]. ANXA4 is
overexpressed in various tumors [21-23] and it is involved
in chemoresistance [21, 22, 24-27] other than invasion
and metastasis [28]. Intriguingly, Fhit restoration in Fhitnegative lung cancer cells blocks ANXA4 translocation
from cytosol to the inner side of plasma membrane during
paclitaxel administration, an effect that contribute to
chemoresistance, thus sensitizing again cancer cells to the
drug [19].
In this study, we report that a short Fhit-derived
peptide still able to physically bind ANXA4, recapitulates
the Fhit wild-type activity with regard to ANXA4, as this
Fhit sequence can prevent ANXA4 translocation to plasma
membrane in paclitaxel-treated lung cancer cells, thus
resulting in the restoration of chemosensibility to the drug
both in vitro and in vivo experiments.

Annexin 4 binds the N-terminus of Fhit protein
In order to map the region of Fhit protein binding
Annexin A4, we cloned downstream GST three truncated
FHIT cDNAs, namely TR1 (332 bp), TR2 (212 bp) and
TR3 (113 bp), all containing the N-terminus common to the
wild-type Fhit protein. TR1, TR2, and TR3 correspond to
the 111, 71, and 38 N-terminal aminoacids of Fhit protein,
respectively (Figure 1A). Annexin A4 binds wild-type
Fhit/GST fusion protein as well as all shorter forms of Fhit
fusion proteins, indicating its binding to the N-terminus of
Fhit (Figure 1B). In our previous paper, we reported that
Fhit/Annexin A4 interaction was only detectable in the
presence of DSP [19]. DSP is a cross-linker containing an
amine-reactive N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS); NHS esters
react with primary amine group located at lysine (Lys,
K) residue sidechain. Since Lys residues are abundant
and easily accessible on the hydrophilic surface of most
proteins they usually crosslink with high efficiency.
We assumed that the Lys interacting to DSP must
be positioned on a Fhit surface region binding Annexin
A4. Due to the unavailability of experimental structures
reporting such a complex, molecular modeling studies
were performed to highlight the most favored Lys
residues for interacting with DSP (Supplementary
Figure S1). Taking into account the reaction between
the Lys and the cross-linker, we have considered two
different molecular descriptors in order to predict the
most favored adduct formation: a) the exposition of the
nucleophilic residue, and b) the electron availability
on the primary amine located at the Lys sidechain. The
first descriptor was computed as the average solvent
surface area (ASASA) related to the Lys sidechain and
the second was derived from the residue partial charge
distribution. Both parameters required to take into account
the Fhit conformation flexibility; consequently extensive
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on
our Fhit 3D model sampling, at regular time intervals, 150
structures. These conformers were used for the ASASA
calculation and, after clusterisation, for the quantum
mechanics computing of the Mulliken charge distribution
(Supplementary Figures S2-S3). Moreover, with the
aim to deep evaluate Fhit conformational properties, in
particular highlighting the most flexible protein areas,
MD trajectory was submitted to residue fluctuation
analysis (RFA) (Supplementary Figure S4). The results
marked the Fhit 108-127 loop as having greater flexibility
than the remainder of the protein. Taking into account
its experimental activity, we focused our attention on
structural similarities between the Fhit peptide segment
1-38 and the full length protein, by submitting the short
peptide to the same MD protocol adopted for Fhit. The MD
29928

trajectories of 1-38 and Fhit were compared by computing,
frame by frame, the root mean square deviation (RMSd),
generating a squared matrix containing 22500 RMSd
values (corresponding to all possible combination among
the 1-38 and Fhit MD structures). Such an analysis
revealed remarkable similarities, with ~81% of the
structures reporting an all atoms RMSd value ranging
from 2 to 4 Å (Supplementary Figure S5). To identify the
region of 1-38, containing Lys residues (11, 18 and 29),
structurally closest to Fhit, the short peptide MD trajectory
was submitted to the same RFA previously described for
the full length protein. The comparison between 1-38 and
Fhit RFA revealed the stronger analogies for the region
containing Lys11 (Supplementary Figure S6). In particular
His8, Leu9, Ile10, Lys11 and Pro12 of 1-38 peptide
reported an average difference in terms of RMSd of about
0.02 Å with respect to the full-length Fhit.
On the basis of the above reported information, we
addressed to the Fhit 8-12 residue sequence a key role
in the Annexin 4 recognition. With the aim to improve

water solubility of the new shorter peptide, we included
hydrophilic residues at Fhit position 7 (Gln) and 13 (Ser).
To validate this hypothesis, we tested a synthetic
Fhit 7-13 peptide on A549 and Calu-2 cultured lung cancer
cells. To assure the cell permeation of Fhit 7-13 peptide,
the sequence was fused downstream to a Tat peptide (an
epitope mapping at position 47-58 of the HIV Tat protein);
24 h after Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide administration, cell lysates
were co-immunoprecipitated with a Tat monoclonal
antibody. As demonstrated in Figure 1C, Annexin 4 was
detectable only in the presence of Fhit 7-13 peptide, but
not in cells treated with a Tat-Fhit 7-13 scrambled peptide.

Fhit peptide blocks annexin 4 translocation from
cytosol to plasma membrane
As previously reported [19], treatment of A549
and Calu-2 cancer cells with paclitaxel induced cytosolic

Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide triggers apoptosis of lung
cancer cells and sensitizes them to paclitxel

translocation to the inner side of plasma membrane. Fhit
overexpression blocked Annexin A4 translocation from
cytosol to the plasma membrane, observed after paclitaxel
administration. Here, we tested the ability of the Tat-Fhit
7-13 peptide to block Annexin 4 in the cytosol. Figure
2A shows that the simultaneous treatment with paclitaxel
and Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide, was able to block Annexin A4
translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane compared
to the scrambled Tat-Fhit 7-13 used as a control in
both A549 and Calu-2 cells. In addition, other peptides
designed from both N- and C-termini of the Fhit protein,
failed either to bind or sequester Annexin 4 in the cytosol
(data not shown). These data indicated that the N-terminus
of Fhit is responsible for the binding with Annexin 4 and,
more specifically, that the peptide sequence ranging from
position 7 to 13 of Fhit is crucial for the binding.

To determine if Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide could mimic
the effects of the wild-type Fhit protein on A549 and Calu2 lung cancer cell lines, cells were treated with a single
administration of 50, 100 or 150 µM Fhit Tat-7-13 peptide
and 24 h later cell death was assessed by flow cytometry.
Interestingly, we observed dose-dependent sub-G1 peaks
accounting for 16%, 22%, and 32% of cell population,
for the growing doses of peptide administered to A549
cells. The Tat-Fhit 7-13 scrambled peptide had no effect
in triggering cell death (Figure 2B). Furthermore, Tat-Fhit
7-13 peptide sensitizes A549 cells to paclitaxel, as shown
by TUNEL assay; in fact, the percentage of apoptotic cells
increased three-fold compared to controls (60% versus
20%) (Figure 2C). Comparable results were obtained after

reported. C. A549 and Calu-2 cells treated with Tat-scrambled peptide and Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide for 24 h, as described in B, were analyzed

Taken together, these data indicate that the Fhit 7-13

resulted still stable and undegraded (see Supplementary
Figure S7A-S7C).
We further investigated the in vivo effects of TatFhit 7-13 peptide with or without paclitaxel treatment in a
preclinical model of lung cancer, using six groups of mice
(n = 5 mice per group). Each group was subcutaneously
injected with 1x107 A549 cells. When tumors reached the
diameter of 15 mm, three groups were treated either with
a single administration of 40 mg/kg paclitaxel, or 50 mg/
kg Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide, or both; mice were monitored
on a regular basis. The remaining three groups, used as
controls, were either left untreated or treated with Tat-Fhit
7-13 scrambled or treated with Tat-Fhit 7-13 scrambled

plus paclitaxel; 48 h after treatments, mice were sacrificed
and tumors were evaluated by weight. A dramatic effect
on tumor growth inhibition was observed in the group of
mice treated with both paclitaxel and Tat-Fhit 7-13 peptide
compared to Tat-Fhit 7-13 or paclitaxel alone or controls.
Tumors treated with Tat-Fhit 7-13 or paclitaxel showed
a reduction in tumor wt to 82% or 60% of controls,
respectively, while their simultaneous administration
resulted in tumor reduction to 33% of controls (Figure
3A, 3C, and Supplementary Figure S8). After tumor
protein lysate fractionation into cytosolic and plasma
membrane fractions, we observed that Tat-Fhit 7-13
treatment reduced the extent of Annexin A4 translocation
to the plasma membrane after in vivo administration of
paclitaxel (Figure 3B), thus indicating that the reported
effect on tumor shrinkage in mice treated with the Tat-Fhit
7-13 plus paclitaxel was mainly due to the ability of the
peptide to trap Annexin A4 in the cytosol.

for further studies because of its oncogenic role in the
pathogenesis of cancer [19, 28] and chemoresistance,
assessed for the first time in renal cancer cells resistant
to paclitaxel and then also highlighted with cisplatin in
cancer cell lines of different types [35, 36]. Intriguingly,
as Fhit loss is also involved in cancer cells refractory
to paclitaxel and cisplatin [17, 30], the discovery of
the Fhit-ANXA4 complex offers opportunities of
investigation to search for novel mechanisms responsible
for chemoresistance, an event connected to the failure of
pharmacological treatment of cancer patients that accounts
for their dismal prognosis.
We recently studied the possible role of Fhit
in paclitaxel resistance with regard to ANXA4
overexpression; we demonstrated that, while ANXA4
is overexpressed and located to the inner side of plasma
membrane in Fhit-negative lung cancer cells treated with
paclitaxel, virally-mediated Fhit overexpression restores
sensitivity to paclitaxel both in vitro and in vivo by
delocalizing ANXA4 to cytosol [19]. In the present study,
as apparently the interference with ANXA4 could possibly
not require a full length Fhit protein, we explored the
opportunity to identify the shortest Fhit protein sequence
still able to recognize the oncogenic ANXA4 thus exerting
the biological effects of the Fhit wild-type protein.
The molecular mapping of the Fhit protein domain
interacting with Annexin A4 led to narrow the interaction
domain to aminoacids 7 to 13 of the Fhit protein.
Interestingly, the introduction of this peptide into cells
did mimic the behavior of wild-type Fhit protein toward
Annexin A4; in fact, the administration of a synthetic TatFhit 7-13 peptide to lung cancer cells: a) blocked Annexin
A4 translocation from cytosol to plasma membrane; b)
acted synergistically with paclitaxel in triggering apoptosis
of lung cancer cells; c) induced dramatic regression of
A549 tumor xenografts in combination with paclitaxel.
Our model suggests that both Fhit protein and Fhitmimetic peptide could interfere with a protein complex
recruited by ANXA4 at the plasma membrane level thus
determining its relocalization to cytosol. The clarification
of the fine-tuning mechanisms governing the Fhit-ANXA4
binding will be a quite interesting field of investigation for
better understanding the role of both Fhit and ANXA4 in
chemoresistance.
In conclusion, these findings open the interesting
perspective of the generation of an innovative drug to be
translated in cancer therapy, as the pursue of a possible
approach able to overcome chemoresistance would be
desirable to fight otherwise incurable cancers. The Fhit
7-13 peptide might serve as a lead compound for the
development of synthetic Fhit-mimetic small molecules
with the fascinating perspective of their combination
with already commercially available drugs; this approach
would apparently be helpful for patient refractory to
conventional therapies alone, thus making anticancer
therapies less toxic and more effective.

DISCUSSION
Fhit loss has been extensively linked to many
processes involved in human and experimental
tumorigenesis, including reduced apoptosis, genomic
instability, chemoresistance, and, more recently, invasion
[29-31], even though the mechanisms governing its
activity are still largely obscure. The contribution of Fhit
loss to these hallmarks of cancer [19] makes this small
protein a very interesting candidate for the development
of novel anticancer therapies. However, as no pathway
for Fhit function has been discovered for long time after
FHIT gene cloning, the only therapeutic approach used
to restore Fhit function in cancer cells has been limited
to virus-mediated gene therapy of preclinical models of
cancer [32].
We recently begun to shed lights about Fhit protein
partners unveiling novel pathways depending upon it; in
fact, by using a proteomic approach we reported for the
first time a Fhit complex including Hsp10, Hsp60, and
ferredoxin reductase which underlies and supports the
role of Fhit in apoptosis through the generation of free
radicals in mitochondria [17]. However, even though
there are growing evidences of mitochondria as druggable
organelles for cancer therapy [33], Fhit is not suitable
to this matter, as it is evident the need of the wild-type
protein to restore susceptibility to apoptosis triggered by
reactive species of oxygen in Fhit-negative cancer cells
[15, 16, 34]. Thus, although encouraging as a proof of
principle, the possibility of overexpressing the native Fhit
protein through viral vectors is very far from large-scale
clinical applications for cancer treatment.
These findings prompted us to search for novel
Fhit partners with the purpose to identify proteins with
oncogenic activity in order to interfere with their function
in cancer cells. The isolation of Annexin A4 as a novel
Fhit-interacting protein was a very interesting finding

Tat peptide (from the amino acids 47-58 HIV-1 Tat
protein -YGRKKRRQRRR) was synthesized upstream to
Fhit peptides in order to drive them into the cell. Both
Fhit and scrambled peptides were from Invitrogen. A549
cells were treated with the following peptides: Tat-Fhit
7-13 (Tat-G-QHLIKPS); Tat-Scrambled 7-13 (Tat-GLSKQPHI). Peptides were administered to cell cultures at
the concentrations of 50, 100, and 150 microM; 24 h after
treatment, cell cycle perturbations were assessed by flow
cytometric analysis [37, 38].

Animal studies
Mice were maintained and animal experiments
conducted under institutional guidelines established for
the Animal Facility at The Ohio State University; nu/
nu mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.
Tumors were established by injecting 1 x 107 A549
cells subcutaneously into the right flanks of 6 wk-old
female nude (nu/nu) mice. Paclitaxel was administrated
intravenously as a single treatment at the concentration
of 40 mg/kg. Synthetic peptides were used in vivo at
the concentration of 50 mg/kg; mice were injected
intravenously with a single dose of peptides and sacrificed
48 h later to evaluate tumor weight.
Tumor size was measured on regular basis by using
a digital caliper and the equation V (in mm3) = (A x B2)/2,
where A is the largest diameter and B is the perpendicular
diameter.

Molecular modeling
With the aim to identify a target model for our
theoretical studies, the 3D crystallographic structures,
available into the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with codes
1EMS, 1-2FHI, 1-6FIT [39-43], reporting Fhit, alone or
interacting with ligands or proteins, were selected and
graphically inspected (Supplementary Figure S1). The
model 4FIT, reporting the lowest number of missing
residues and a X-ray resolution equal to 2.5 Å, was
selected and considered in our simulation. The original

CONFLICTS OF INTERESTS

PDB structure required a preliminary treatment consisting
in the addition of the missing amminoacid at position
1 and of the highly flexible loop corresponding to the
sequence 108-127. Co-crystallized water molecules were
removed and hydrogen atoms were added. All preliminary
procedures were carried out using the Prime module and
the Maestro GUI, as implemented in the Schrodinger
software suite 2011 [44]. Shortened Fhit derivatives,
sequences 1-38 and 7-13, were obtained from the 4FIT
model. All molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were
performed using the force field OPLSA-2005, up to 15 ns
at 300° K using the version 3.0 of the Desmond program
[45] sampling 150 structures at regular time intervals.
Water solvent effects were taken into account by means
of the explicit solvation model TIP3. Lys sidechains
solvent accessible surface areas were computed onto the
MD sampled structures considering a water mimicking
probe with a radius equal to 1.4 Å. MD trajectories were
clustered using the average hierarchical linkage method
considering a backbone related root mean square deviation
(RMSd) cutoff equal to 2.0 Å among the members of the
same cluster. The most representative structure, of each
cluster, was submitted to quantum mechanics/molecular
mechanics (QM/MM) approach for computing the
Mulliken charge distribution related to the Lys sidechains.
These residues were treated using the density functional
theory (DFT) and the LACVP* basis set, the rest of the
target was optimized using the OPLS-2005 force field.
QM/MM calculations were performed by means of the
version 5.7 of the QSite software [46, 47].
