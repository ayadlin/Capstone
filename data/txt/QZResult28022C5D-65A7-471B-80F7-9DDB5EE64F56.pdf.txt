Immunotherapy of Metastatic Renal
Cell Carcinoma*
David F. McDermott, MD1,2,3

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) evokes an immune response, which occasionally has resulted in spontaneous
and dramatic remissions. In an attempt to reproduce or accentuate this response, various immunotherapeutic strategies have been studied. The most consistent antitumor activity has been reported with interferona (IFN-a) and interleukin-2 (IL-2). In recent years, randomized trials have suggested that high-dose, intravenous bolus IL-2 is superior in terms of response rate and possibly in terms of response quality to regimens
that involve either low-dose IL-2 and IFN-a, intermediate- or low-dose IL-2 alone, or low-dose IFN-a alone.
More significantly, investigations associated with those trials suggested that the potential exists for identifying predictors of response (or resistance) and limiting IL-2 therapy to those patients who hare most likely
to benefit. Although the role of low-dose, single-agent cytokines is limited, combinations of cytokines with
targeted therapy may have merit. Several studies, including 2 completed, large, phase 3 trials of interferon
plus bevacizumab versus interferon alone, have demonstrated superior efficacy with the combination regimen compared with cytokine monotherapy and suggested the potential of an additive effect that requires
further exploration. For patients who are unlikely to benefit from IL-2 or who are unable to receive it, the
emergence ‘‘targeted immunotherapy’’ offers hope for improved clinical outcome. Improvements in patient
selection, novel agents, and combination therapy will be required to optimize the benefits of immunotherC 2009

The ability of some renal tumors to evoke an immune response and the lack of benefit observed with
standard chemotherapy and radiation led to the application of immunotherapy for patients with metastatic
renal cell carcinoma (RCC).1-3 In an attempt to reproduce or accentuate this response, various immunotherapeutic strategies have been used, including nonspecific stimulators of the immune system, specific
antitumor immunotherapy, adoptive immunotherapy, the induction of a graft-versus-tumor response
through allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and the administration of partially purified or
recombinant cytokines.4-14 Although immunotherapy was once the standard of care, the advent of novel
therapies that target angiogenesis and signal transduction pathways has produced significant clinical benefits and has prompted a reassessment of the role of immunotherapy.15-18 Recent insights into how the

immune response to a tumor is regulated may allow
patients to obtain a durable response to immunotherapy
without the significant toxicity associated with conventional approaches. This review describes how improvements in patient selection, combination therapy, and
investigational agents might expand and better define the
role of immunotherapy in metastatic RCC.

Cytokine Therapy
Although several cytokines have demonstrated antitumor
activity in RCC, the most consistent results have been
reported with interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-a (IFNa). In contrast to the results achieved with molecularly targeted therapies (eg, sorafenib, sunitinib), which lead to tumor shrinkage in most treated patients but do not
produce remissions of cancer when therapy is discontinued, the administration of high-dose, bolus IL-2 consistently has produced durable responses in a small
percentage of patients with advanced RCC.19-21 However, the substantial toxicity and limited efficacy that are
associated with IL-2 have narrowed its application to
highly selected patients treated at specialized centers.22,23
Although IFN-a has produced modest benefits in unselected patients, randomized clinical trials have revealed a
small survival benefit with manageable toxic effects compared with non–IFN-a control arms.24-31 Because it
became the de facto standard of care worldwide, regulatory agencies have supported the use of IFN-a as the conCancer

May 15, 2009

trol arm for randomized trials with targeted therapies that
are described elsewhere.15-18 The results of these investigations, in general, have established the superiority of targeted agents in previously untreated patients, thereby
narrowing the future use of IFN-a as a single agent in this
setting.
In recent years, the relative merits of these low-dose
and high-dose cytokine regimens have been clarified by
the results of 4 randomized trials (Table 1).32-35 In the
most consequential trial, the French Immunotherapy
Group randomized patients who had an intermediate
likelihood of responding to IL-2 and IFN-a to receive either medroxyprogesterone (control group), or subcutaneous IFN-a, or subcutaneous IL-2, or the combination of
IFN-a and IL-2.35 Although significant toxicity was more
common in the IL-2 and IFN-a arm, the median overall
survival did not differ between the arms. The investigators
concluded that subcutaneous IFN-a and IL-2 no longer
should be recommended for patients with metastatic
RCC who have an intermediate prognosis.
Taken together, these studies suggest that high-dose,
intravenous bolus IL-2 is superior in terms of response
rate and possibly in terms of response quality to regimens
that involve low-dose IL-2 and IFN-a, intermediate- or
low-dose IL-2 alone, or low-dose IFN-a alone. Consequently, although low-dose, single-agent cytokine therapy
has a limited role in patients with metastatic RCC, highdose, intravenous IL-2 remains a reasonable option for
appropriately selected patients who have access to such
2299

therapy. More significantly, correlative biomarker investigations associated with these trials suggest that the potential exists for identifying predictors of response (or
resistance) and limiting IL-2 therapy to those patients
who are most likely to benefit.

Pathologic and Molecular Predictors of
Response to Interleukin-2
Influence of Histologic Subtype

Responses to immunotherapy are observed most frequently in patients with clear cell RCC.36-38 This observation was detailed in a retrospective analysis of pathology
specimens obtained from 231 patients (163 primary tumor specimens and 68 metastatic tumor specimens) who
had received IL-2 therapy in Cytokine Working Group
(CWG) clinical trials.39,40 For patients who had primary
tumor specimens available for review, the response rate to
IL-2 was 21% (30 of 146 patients) for patients with clear
cell histologic primary tumors compared with 6% for
patients with non-clear cell histologic tumors (1 responder in 17 patients). Among the patients with clear
cell carcinoma, response to IL-2 also was associated with
the presence of good predictive features (eg, >50% alveolar and no granular or papillary features) and the absence
of poor predictive features (eg, >50% granular or any
papillary features). Because of these findings, it may be
appropriate for patients who have primary tumor of a
non-clear cell histologic type or of a clear cell histologic
type but with poor predictive features to forgo IL-2–based
treatment altogether.
Immunohistochemical Markers

Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) has been identified
as an immunohistochemical marker that may predict the
outcomes of patients with RCC. In an analysis by Bui
et al, CAIX expression in 85% of tumor cells (high
CAIX expression) has been associated with improved survival and a higher objective response rate in IL-2–treated
patients. Building on this work, Atkins et al41 developed a
2-component model that combined pathology analysis
and immunohistochemical staining for CAIX. In a retrospective analysis, this model was able to identify a goodrisk group that contained 26 of 27 responders (96%) to
IL-2 compared with only 18 of 39 nonresponders (46%;
2300

odds ratio, 30; P < .01). A significant survival benefit also
was observed for this group (P < .01).
Molecular Markers

Through gene expression profiling of tumor specimens, Pantuck et al42 were able to identify a set of 73
genes whose expression distinguished complete responders from nonresponders after IL-2 therapy. In their hands,
complete responders to IL-2 have a signature gene and
protein expression pattern that includes CAIX, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and chemokine C-X-C
receptor 4 (CXCR4). A similar analysis identified losses of
chromosomes 4, 9, and 17p as possible predictors of IL-2
nonresponse.43 Further investigation into these regions
may improve our understanding of the molecular basis of
an effective immune response in RCC. Although this
approach requires prospective validation, it may become a
powerful aid for clinicians in selecting appropriate treatment options.
Current Investigation in Patient Selection
The CWG has launched the high-dose IL-2 ‘‘Select’’ Trial
to determine, in a prospective fashion, whether the predictive model proposed by Atkins et al41 can identify a group
of patients with advanced RCC who are significantly
more likely to respond to high-dose IL-2–based therapy
(good risk) than a historic, unselected patient population.
New factors (including baseline immune function [eg, Tcell zeta-chain expression, serum arginine, and CAIX levels], immunohistochemical markers, and gene expression
patterns) that may be associated with response to highdose IL-2 therapy also will be explored in an attempt to
limit more narrowly the application of IL-2 to those
patients who are most likely to benefit. Improvements in
patient selection will be necessary as the list of effective
therapies for metastatic RCC grows to ensure that patients
who may attain a durable remission with IL-2 will not
miss this opportunity.
Interleukin-2 Therapy After Vascular
Endothelial Growth Factor Pathwaydirected Therapy
The emergence of molecularly targeted therapies has
offered hope for improved clinical outcome for patients
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Metastatic RCC Immunotherapy/McDermott

with RCC. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
pathway-directed therapy has been recommended for
frontline use with other treatments that are reserved for
the time of disease progression. However, a retrospective
analysis suggests that the toxicity of IL-2 therapy may be
higher in patients who have received prior VEGF-targeted
therapy, particularly sunitinib, and that antitumor activity
may be diminished.44 Although the mechanism for the
observed increased incidence of cardiovascular complications remains speculative, the assumption that IL-2 can be
given safely after VEGF pathway-targeted therapy may
not be valid.

Combination of Immunotherapy and
Targeted/Antiangiogenic Therapy
Although the role of low-dose, single-agent cytokines is
limited, combinations of cytokines with targeted therapy
may have merit. Bevacizumab and IL-2 have been combined in a CWG trial. The preliminary results suggest
that these 2 agents can be given safely in combination, but
efficacy data are pending.45 Sorafenib and interferon have
been combined in 2 separate single-arm, phase 2 trials.46,47 Those trials demonstrated objective response rates
of 18% and 35%. Toxic effects observed were typical of
those observed with each single agent, with a notable
reduction in hand-foot syndrome compared with sorafenib monotherapy data. A full exploration of this combination regimen awaits further investigation in randomized
trials. Two recently completed, large phase 3 trials of
interferon plus bevacizumab versus interferon alone have
demonstrated superior efficacy with the combination regimen compared with cytokine monotherapy and suggest
the potential of an additive effect.18,48 Confirmation of
the benefit of combination therapy will require a randomized trial comparing the combination versus bevacizumab
alone.

Investigational Immunotherapy
Metastatic RCC has long been a testing ground for novel
immunotherapies. Several such approaches, including
vaccination and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation,
have been tested during the past 2 decades. The initial
reports of applying allogeneic bone marrow transplantation were encouraging, but further clinical trials have
Cancer

May 15, 2009

highlighted the potential toxicity and limited applicability
of this approach.10-12 Vaccination therapy has demonstrated the generation of potentially relevant immune
responses, although clinical benefit and objective
responses have not been consistently observed.49-51 Avigan et al49 have conducted a series of clinical trials with a
dendritic cell/tumor fusion vaccine approach that have
produced encouraging clinical responses in patients with a
variety of malignancies, including RCC. To realize the
full potential of a vaccine approach in RCC, combinations with immune stimulants (eg, granulocyte-macrophage–colony-stimulating factor) and inhibitors of
natural T-cell regulation pathways (eg, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 [CTLA-4] blockade, T-regulatory cell
depletion) may be necessary.
An improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern the interaction between a tumor and
host immune response have led to the development of several novel immunotherapies that recently have entered the
clinic (Table 2). Obstacles to effective immunotherapy for
RCC likely include the physiologic down-modulation of
the immune response through the increased expression
of molecules like CTLA-4 on the surface of activated T
cells. Mechanisms that have been identified as leading to
tumor-induced immune suppression have included
RCC expression of B7H1 (PDL1), which serves to
restrict the cytolytic function of tumor-infiltrating T
lymphocytes and stimulation of T-regulatory cell
(CD4þ/CD25þ) production, which limits T-cell receptor signaling.
The list of novel agents currently being pursued
includes agents that block T-cell regulation (eg, CTLA-4
and PD1 [programmed death 1] antibodies),52,53 inhibit
tumor-induced immunosuppression (eg, transforming
growth factor b antibody, PDL1 antibody),54 and activate
T cells (eg, CD-137 antibody, IL-21)55,56 and dendritic
cells (eg, toll-like receptor agonists).57 Several of these
agents have demonstrated encouraging efficacy signals in
early trials. Toxicities associated with CTLA-4 antibodies,
including enteritis, skin rash, and hypophysitis, occasionally have been life threatening and also have been associated with tumor response.52 Combination of agents that
block immune down-regulation and inhibit tumorinduced immune suppression may prove particularly
effective in select patients. However, the development of
targeted immunotherapy for RCC is complicated by the

Conclusions
RCC long has been considered an immunologically influenced malignancy and, thus, served as a platform for the
clinical testing of anticancer immunotherapy. The nonspecific cytokines IL-2 and IFN-a have undergone the
most testing and have produced only modest benefits for
unselected patients. High-dose IL-2 remains the only
approach to produce durable responses in patients with
metastatic RCC and, thus, can be considered in appropriately selected patients. Additional molecular and pathologic selection opportunities exist for cytokines, but
considerable validation work is needed before these selection features can be used clinically. Cytokine therapy optimally should be given in the context of a clinical trial
investigating combination therapy and/or patient selection to maximize the benefit of this approach. Targeted
immunotherapeutic strategies have been tested in metastatic RCC, but definitive evidence of clinical benefit is
lacking.
When attempting to determine initial therapy for a
patient with metastatic RCC, the currently available data
suggest that patients with good or intermediate clinical
prognostic features, clear cell histology, and high CAIX
expression in their tumors are more likely to benefit from
high-dose IL-2 therapy and should be presented with this
treatment option. Those patients who have poor clinical
2302

prognostic features and tumors with nonclear cell histology and low CAIX expression do not benefit from IL-2
and should not be receive it.38,40,41 For patients who are
unlikely to benefit from, who are unable to receive, or
who progress after IL-2, the emergence of molecularly targeted therapies offers hope for improved clinical
outcome.15,16,58
In recent years, the list of effective therapies (eg,
angiogenesis inhibition; signal transduction inhibition,
and immunotherapy) for metastatic RCC has increased
substantially. The advent of targeted therapy in RCC does
not eliminate the potential utility of immunotherapy in
RCC but, rather, requires a rational refinement of this
therapy through patient selection, combination regimens,
and novel agents that together may extend overall survival
and increase the cure rate for patients with this disease.

OPEN DISCUSSION
The questions and discussion below follow from the oral presentation given at the Third Cambridge Conference on Innovations and Challenges in Renal Cancer and do not
correspond directly to the written article, which is a more general review.
Dr. Bernard Escudier: Immunologists say there is
no rationale in terms of immunology to use high-dose IL2 because we still do not know how it works on the tumor.
Is it really immunotherapy, or is it a cytotoxic effect?
Dr. David F. McDermott: IL-2 is immunotherapy,
but the evidence is indirect. For example, if you give a
Cancer

May 15, 2009

Metastatic RCC Immunotherapy/McDermott

patient IL-2 and then dexamethasone, you do not get any
responses. The patients who respond, particularly those
who get durable complete remissions, are often more
likely to get a variety of autoimmune phenomena, which
we think are T-cell driven. You could argue that certain
immunotherapies are also antiangiogenic, but I do not
know why that would lead to a response that lasted years
later. They can’t be that effectively cytotoxic.
Dr. Escudier: No one has been able to show any
correlation between 1 immunological parameter and the
response to high-dose IL-2.
Dr. Michael Atkins: A lot of work is now being
done in melanoma, looking at the host and predicting
who responds to immunotherapy. We are further along in
renal cancer than we are in any other cancers in sorting
out what particular component of the tumor might make
it more sensitive to immunotherapy.
Dr. Robert Figlin: We may have been too focused
on the VEGF effects of some of these agents and have not
looked carefully enough at other pathways. These are multitargeted drugs, so we need to think about them in a different way than just the inhibition of VEGF receptor 2. In
addition, when you give these drugs in certain ways you
reverse the immunosuppression associated with the tumor
in some patients. I am not sure that we should be searching for immune-based therapy in window of opportunity
trials when it may be that the targeted therapy is offering
us an opportunity for immune-based responses that we
did not have until the last 3 or 4 years.
Dr. Brian Rini: We are looking mechanistically at
VEGF-targeted therapy and effects on circulating
immune parameters. Such studies may give us a platform
to build not only on immunotherapy but also on VEGFtargeted therapy.
Dr. Ronald M. Bukowski: The exciting observation in the preclinical models with these drugs, not necessarily in renal cancers but in other models where you see
almost total depletion of the cell populations, is the myeloid-derived suppression in the spleens of animals that
have tumors when you give sunitinib.
Dr. Atkins: The paradigm of giving immunotherapy after sunitinib probably does not make sense, but giving it with sunitinib is something that we could explore
further.
Dr. Figlin: Or giving it after you maximize a
response to sunitinib, trying to produce something differCancer

May 15, 2009

ent from what continuing with sunitinib would do if it
maintained remission.
