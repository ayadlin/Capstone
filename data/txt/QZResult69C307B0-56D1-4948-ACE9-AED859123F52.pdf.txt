Abstract
The identification of somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase
domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in
patients with non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the
association of such mutations with the clinical response to
EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), such as gefitinib and
erlotinib, have had a substantial effect on the treatment of this
disease. EGFR gene amplification has also been associated
with an increased therapeutic response to EGFR-TKIs. The
effects of these two types of EGFR alteration on EGFR function
have remained unclear, however. We have now examined 16
NSCLC cell lines, including eight newly established lines from
Japanese NSCLC patients, for the presence of EGFR mutations
and amplification. Four of the six cell lines that harbor EGFR
mutations were found to be positive for EGFR amplification,
whereas none of the 10 cell lines negative for EGFR mutation
manifested EGFR amplification, suggesting that these two
types of EGFR alteration are closely associated. Endogenous
EGFRs expressed in NSCLC cell lines positive for both EGFR
mutation and amplification were found to be constitutively
activated as a result of ligand-independent dimerization.
Furthermore, the patterns of both EGFR amplification and
EGFR autophosphorylation were shown to differ between cell
lines harboring the two most common types of EGFR mutation
(exon 19 deletion and L858R point mutation in exon 21). These
results reveal distinct biochemical properties of endogenous
mutant forms of EGFR expressed in NSCLC cell lines and may
have implications for treatment of this condition. [Cancer Res

Introduction
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a 170-kDa
transmembrane glycoprotein with an extracellular ligand binding
domain, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine
kinase domain and is encoded by a gene (EGFR) located at human
chromosomal region 7p12 (1–3). The binding of ligand to EGFR
induces receptor dimerization and consequent conformational
changes that result in activation of the intrinsic tyrosine kinase,
receptor autophosphorylation, and activation of a signaling
cascade (4, 5). Aberrant signaling by EGFR plays an important
role in cancer development and progression (3).

EGFR is frequently overexpressed in non–small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of this
disease (6, 7). Given the biological importance of EGFR signaling
in cancer, several agents have been synthesized that inhibit the
receptor tyrosine kinase activity. Two such inhibitors of the
tyrosine kinase activity of EGFR (EGFR-TKI), gefitinib and
erlotinib, both of which compete with ATP for binding to the
tyrosine kinase pocket of the receptor, have been extensively
studied in patients with NSCLC (8, 9). We and others have shown
that a clinical response to these agents is more common in
women than in men, in Japanese than in individuals from Europe
or the United States, in patients with adenocarcinoma than in
those with other histologic subtypes of cancer, and in patients
who have never smoked than in those with a history of smoking
(10–14). Mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have
also been detected in a subset of lung cancer patients and shown
to predict sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs (15–17). Indeed, the clinical
characteristics of patients with known EGFR mutations are
similar to those of other individuals most likely to respond to
treatment with EGFR-TKIs (18–22). These mutations arise in the
first four exons (exons 18–21) corresponding to the tyrosine kinase
domain of EGFR, and they affect key amino acids surrounding
the ATP-binding cleft (23, 24). In-frame deletions that eliminate
four highly conserved amino acids (LREA) encoded by exon 19 are
the most common type of EGFR mutation, with missense point
mutations in exon 21 that result in a specific amino acid
substitution at position 858 (L858R) being the second most
common. In addition to EGFR mutations, other molecular
changes may play a role in determining sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs
(22, 25–28). NSCLC patients with an increased EGFR copy number,
as revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have
thus been found to show an increased response rate to and
prolonged survival after gefitinib therapy (22, 25–27).
Given that EGFR is mutated or amplified (or both) in NSCLC,
it is important to determine the biological effects of such EGFR
alterations on EGFR function (15, 29–32). Transient transfection
of various cell types with vectors encoding wild-type or mutant
versions of EGFR showed that the activation of mutant receptors
by EGF is more pronounced and sustained than is that of the wildtype receptor (15, 30). However, detailed biochemical analysis of
NSCLC cell lines with endogenous EGFR mutations has been
limited. We have now identified EGFR mutations in three NSCLC
cell lines newly established from Japanese patients. Furthermore,
we have characterized a panel of 16 NSCLC cell lines for EGFR
mutations and amplification and evaluated the relation between
the presence of these two types of EGFR alteration and sensitivity
to gefitinib. The effects of EGFR alterations on activation status
of EGFR and on downstream signaling were also evaluated.

Differential Properties of Mutant EGFRs in NSCLC

Finally, in EGFR mutant cell lines showing constitutive EGFR
activation, we assessed how the mutations activate the tyrosine
kinase domain of the receptor.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines. The human NSCLC cell lines NCI-H226 (H226), NCI-H292
(H292), NCI-H460 (H460), NCI-H1299 (H1299), NCI-H1650 (H1650), and
NCI-H1975 (H1975) were obtained from the American Type Culture
Collection (Manassas, VA). PC-9 and A549 cells were obtained as described
previously (33). Ma-1 cells were kindly provided by E. Shimizu (Tottori
University, Yonago, Japan). We established seven cell lines (KT-2, KT-4,
Ma-25, Ma-31, Ma-34, Ma-45, and Ma-53) from tissue or pleural effusion of
Japanese patients with advanced NSCLC. These cell lines were cultured
under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37jC in RPMI 1640 (Sigma,
St. Louis, MO) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Informed
consent for establishment of cell lines and tumor DNA sequencing was
obtained in accordance with the ethical guidelines for human genome/
genetic analysis in Japan.
Growth inhibition assay. Gefitinib was kindly provided by AstraZeneca
(Macclesfield, United Kingdom) as a pure substance and was diluted in
DMSO to obtain a stock solution of 20 mmol/L. For growth inhibition
assays, cells (0.5  104 to 4.5  104) were plated in 96-well flat-bottomed
plates and cultured for 24 h before the addition of various concentrations of
gefitinib and incubation for an additional 72 h. TetraColor One (5 mmol/L
tetrazolium monosodium salt and 0.2 mmol/L 1-methoxy-5-methyl
phenazinium methylsulfate; Seikagaku, Tokyo, Japan) was then added to
each well, and the cells were incubated for 3 h at 37jC before measurement
of absorbance at 490 nm with a Multiskan Spectrum instrument (Thermo
Labsystems, Boston, MA). Absorbance values were expressed as a
percentage of that for untreated cells, and the concentration of gefitinib
resulting in 50% growth inhibition (IC50) was calculated.
Genetic analysis of EGFR. Genomic DNA was extracted from cell lines
with the use of a QIAamp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Tokyo, Japan), and exons
18 to 21 of EGFR were amplified by the PCR and sequenced directly. PCR
was done in a reaction mixture (25 AL) containing 50 ng of genomic DNA
and TaKaRa Taq polymerase (TaKaRa BIO, Tokyo, Japan) and with an initial
incubation for 3 min at 94jC followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 94jC, 30 s
at 58jC, and 20 s at 72jC and by a final incubation for 7 min at 72jC. The
PCR products were purified with a Microcon YM-100 filtration device
(Millipore, Billerica, MA) before sequencing with the use of an ABI BigDye
Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City,
CA). Sequencing reaction mixtures were subjected to electrophoresis with

an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems). Primers for
mutation analysis (sense and antisense, respectively) were as follows:
exon 18, 5¶-CAAATGAGCTGGCAAGTGCCGTGTC-3¶ and 5¶-GAGTTTCCCAAACACTCAGTGAAA-C-3¶; exon 19, 5¶-GCAATATCAGCCTTAGGTGCGGCTC-3¶and 5¶-CATAGAAAGTGAACATTTAGGATGTG-3¶; exon 20,
5¶-CCATGAGTACGTATTTTGAAACTC-3¶ and 5¶-CATATCCCCATGGCAAACTCTTGC-3¶; and exon 21, 5¶-CTAACGTTCGCCAGCCATAAGTCC-3¶
and 5¶-GCTGCGAGCTCACCCAGAATGTCTGG-3¶.
FISH. EGFR copy number per cell was determined by FISH with the use
of the LSI EGFR Spectrum Orange and CEP7 Spectrum Green probes (Vysis;
Abbott, Des Plaines, IL). Cells were centrifuged onto glass slides with a
Shandon cytocentrifuge (Thermo Electron, Pittsburgh, PA) and fixed by
consecutive incubations with ice-cold 70% ethanol for 10 min, 85% ethanol for
5 min, and 100% ethanol for 5 min. Slides were stored at 20jC until analysis.
Cells were subsequently subjected to digestion with pepsin for 10 min at
37jC, washed with water, dehydrated with a graded series of ethanol
solutions, denatured with 70% formamide in 2 SSC for 5 min at 72jC, and
dehydrated again with a graded series of ethanol solutions before incubation with a hybridization mixture consisting of 50% formamide, 2 SSC, Cot-1
DNA, and labeled DNA. The slides were washed for 5 min at 73jC with
3 SSC, for 5 min at 37jC with 4 SSC containing 0.1% Triton X-100, and
for 5 min at room temperature with 2 SSC before counterstaining with
antifade solution containing 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Hybridization
signals were scored in 40 nuclei with the use of a 100 immersion objective.
Nuclei with a disrupted boundary were excluded from the analysis. Gene
amplification was defined by an EGFR/chromosome 7 copy number ratio
of z2 or by the presence of clusters of z15 copies of EGFR per cell in z10%
of cells, as described previously (25, 27).
Immunoblot analysis. Cell lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a
7.5% gel, and the separated proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking of nonspecific sites with 5% skim milk, the membrane
was incubated overnight at room temperature with primary antibodies.
Antibodies to phosphorylated EGFR (pY845, pY1068, or pY1173), extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated AKT, AKT, Src homology
and collagen (Shc), and phosphorylated Shc were obtained from Cell Signaling
Technology (Beverly, MA); antibodies to EGFR were from Zymed (South San
Francisco, CA); antibodies to phosphorylated ERK were from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA); and antibodies to h-actin (loading control)
were from Sigma. Immune complexes were detected by incubation of the
membrane for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase–
conjugated goat antibodies to mouse or rabbit immunoglobulin (Amersham
Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) and by subsequent exposure
to enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, MA).

Treatment of cells with neutralizing antibodies. Cells were exposed
to neutralizing antibodies (each at 12 Ag/mL) for 3 h before EGF
stimulation. The antibodies included those to EGF and to transforming
growth factor-a (TGF-a), both from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) as
well as antibodies to EGFR (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). Cell
lysates were then prepared and subjected to immunoblot analysis with
antibodies to phosphorylated EGFR (pY1068) and to EGFR as described
above.

Chemical cross-linking assay. Chemical cross-linking was done as
described previously (34, 35). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and
then incubated for 20 min at 4jC with 1 mmol/L bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBS. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by the addition of glycine to a final concentration of 250 mmol/L
and incubation for an additional 5 min at 4jC. The cells were washed with
PBS, and cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 4% gel and subjected
to immunoblot analysis with anti-EGFR (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

Differential Properties of Mutant EGFRs in NSCLC

Results
Effect of gefitinib on the growth of NSCLC cell lines. We first
examined the effect of the EGFR-TKI gefitinib on the growth of 16
NSCLC cell lines, eight of which (KT-2, KT-4, Ma-1, Ma-25, Ma-31,
Ma-34, Ma-45, and Ma-53) were established from Japanese NSCLC
patients for the present study. The IC50 values for gefitinib
chemosensitivity ranged from 0.07 to 12.46 Amol/L (a 178-fold
difference; Table 1).
Four cell lines (PC-9, KT-2, KT-4, and Ma-1) were relatively
sensitive to gefitinib with IC50 values between 0.07 and 2.34 Amol/L,
whereas the remaining 12 lines were considered resistant to
gefitinib (IC50 > 6 Amol/L). No relation was apparent between
sensitivity to gefitinib and histologic subtype of NSCLC for this
panel of cell lines (Table 1).
EGFR mutation and amplification in NSCLC cell lines. We
screened the 16 NSCLC cell lines for the presence of EGFR
mutations in exons 18 to 21, which encode the catalytic domain of
the receptor. As previously described (36–39), PC-9, H1650, and
H1975 cell lines were found to harbor EGFR mutations [del(E746A750) in PC-9 and H1650 and both L858R and T790M in H1975].
Furthermore, we detected EGFR mutations in three of the newly
established cell lines (Ma-1, KT-2, and KT-4). Ma-1 cells, which were
isolated from a female ex smoker with adenocarcinoma (>30 years
of age), were found to harbor a small deletion within exon 19
[del(E746-A750); Fig. 1A; Table 1]. Both KT-2 cells [derived from a
male ex smoker with adenocarcinoma (>30 years of age)] and KT-4
cells (derived from a male nonsmoker with large cell carcinoma)
harbor a point mutation (L858R) in exon 21 (Fig. 1B; Table 1). Four
of these six NSCLC cell lines with EGFR mutations (PC-9, Ma-1,
KT-2, and KT-4) are sensitive to gefitinib (Table 1), consistent with
clinical observations (15–17, 20, 22).
We next examined the 16 NSCLC cell lines for the presence of
EGFR amplification by FISH analysis with a probe specific for

EGFR and a control probe for the centromere of chromosome 7.
Four (PC-9, Ma-1, KT-2, and KT-4) of the 16 cell lines, all of which
harbor EGFR mutations, were found to be positive for EGFR
amplification (Fig. 2; Table 1). PC-9 and Ma-1 cell lines, both of
which harbor the same exon 19 deletion, showed an EGFR/
chromosome copy number ratio of z2, whereas KT-2 and KT-4,
both of which harbor the L858R mutation in exon 21, showed a
clustered unbalanced gain of EGFR copy number (Fig. 2). The four
cell lines that manifested both EGFR mutation and amplification
were sensitive to gefitinib (Table 1). The EGFR mutant cell lines
H1650 and H1975 showed no evidence of EGFR amplification
(Fig. 2), and both of these lines were relatively resistant to gefitinib
(Table 1). None of the cell lines negative for EGFR mutations
manifested EGFR amplification (Table 1), suggesting that EGFR
mutation is closely associated with EGFR amplification (P < 0.05,
m2 test).
EGFR expression in NSCLC cell lines. We examined the basal
abundance of EGFR in EGFR wild-type and mutant NSCLC cell
lines by immunoblot analysis. The amount of EGFR in the cell
lines PC-9, Ma-1, KT-2, and KT-4, all of which manifest EGFR
amplification and EGFR mutation, was increased compared with
that in EGFR wild-type cell lines (A549 and H1299) or EGFR mutant
cell lines negative for EGFR amplification (H1975 and H1650;
Fig. 3). These results, thus, reveal a close relation between increased
EGFR expression and EGFR amplification in this panel of NSCLC
cell lines, consistent with the results of previous analyses of NSCLC
tissue specimens (6, 7).
EGFR phosphorylation in NSCLC cell lines. We examined
tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous EGFRs in NSCLC cell lines
by immunoblot analysis with phosphorylation site–specific antibodies. In cells (A549) that express only wild-type EGFR,
phosphorylation of the receptor at Y845, Y1068, or Y1173 was
undetectable in the absence of EGF but was markedly induced on

lines. Lysates (40 Ag of protein) of NSCLC
cell lines positive or negative for EGFR
mutation or amplification, as indicated,
were subjected to immunoblot analysis with
antibodies to EGFR and to h-actin (top ).
The abundance of EGFR relative to that of
h-actin was determined by densitometry
(bottom ). Representative of three
independent experiments.

Figure 4. Phosphorylation of EGFR and

cell lines. Serum-deprived cells were

cell lysates (40 Ag of protein) were
subjected to immunoblot analysis with
antibodies to phosphorylated forms of

(pAKT ) as well as antibodies to all forms of

exposure of the cells to this growth factor (Fig. 4). Similar results
were obtained with H1650 cells, which are positive for the deletion
in exon 19 of EGFR but negative for EGFR amplification. In
contrast, PC-9 and Ma-1 cells, which are positive for both the exon
19 deletion and EGFR amplification, manifested an increased
basal level of EGFR phosphorylation at Y1068, indicative of
constitutive activation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. Exposure of
PC-9 or Ma-1 cells to EGF induced EGFR phosphorylation at Y845
and Y1173, showing that the mutant receptors remain sensitive
to ligand stimulation. Furthermore, the cell lines (H1975, KT-2,
and KT-4) with the L858R point mutation manifested an increased
basal level of EGFR phosphorylation at Y845, Y1068, and Y1173,
and the extent of phosphorylation at these residues was increased
only slightly by treatment of the cells with EGF, indicative of
constitutive activation of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. These results
thus showed that endogenous EGFR mutations result in
constitutive receptor activation, and that the patterns of tyrosine
phosphorylation of EGFR differ between the two most common
types of EGFR mutant.
Phosphorylation of signaling molecules downstream of
EGFR in NSCLC cell lines. Given that constitutive activation of
EGFR was detected in NSCLC cell lines with endogenous EGFR
mutations, we examined whether signaling molecules that act
downstream of the receptor are also constitutively activated in
these cell lines. We first examined the basal levels of phosphorylation of AKT and ERK, both of which mediate the oncogenic
effects of EGFR. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to phosphorylated forms of AKT or ERK revealed that these molecules are

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (5). March 1, 2007

indeed constitutively activated in the EGFR mutant lines (PC-9,
Ma-1, H1975, KT-2, and KT-4) that manifest constitutive activation
of EGFR, although the extent of phosphorylation varied (Fig. 4).
The increased levels of AKT and ERK phosphorylation in these
mutant cell lines are consistent with the increased level of EGFR
phosphorylation on Y1068, which serves as the docking site for
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and growth factor receptor binding
protein 2, molecules that mediate the activation of AKT and the
Ras-ERK pathway, respectively (2, 40). We next examined whether
the differences in the pattern of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR apparent between NSCLC cell lines harboring
the exon 19 deletion and those with the L858R mutation in exon 21
are associated with distinct alterations in downstream signaling
pathways. Given that Y1173, a major docking site of EGFR for the
adapter protein Shc (2, 40, 41), is constitutively phosphorylated
in cells with the L858R mutation but not in those with the exon 19
deletion, we compared Shc phosphorylation between cell lines
with these two types of EGFR mutation. Ligand-independent
tyrosine phosphorylation of the 52- and 46-kDa isoforms of Shc was
apparent in cell lines with either type of EGFR mutation (Fig. 5).
However, cell lines (KT-2 and KT-4) that harbor the L858R
mutation exhibited a markedly greater basal level of phosphorylation of the 66-kDa isoform of Shc than did those (PC-9 and Ma-1)
that harbor the exon 19 deletion or those (A549) that harbor only
wild-type EGFR. These data suggest that the constitutively active
mutant forms of EGFR induce selective activation of downstream
effectors as a result of differential patterns of receptor autophosphorylation.

Differential Properties of Mutant EGFRs in NSCLC

Ligand-independent dimerization and activation of EGFR
mutants. Evidence suggests that EGFR ligands, including EGF and
TGF-a, secreted by tumor cells themselves might be responsible
for activation of mutant receptors in an autocrine loop (29, 42).
To investigate whether EGFR is constitutively activated as a result
of such an autocrine mechanism in EGFR mutant NSCLC cell lines,
we treated the cells with a combination of three neutralizing
antibodies (anti-EGF, anti–TGF-a, and anti-EGFR) for 3 h and then
examined the effect of EGF on EGFR phosphorylation. The liganddependent activation of EGFR in A549 cells (which express only
wild-type EGFR) was blocked by such antibody treatment (Fig. 6A).
In contrast, treatment of the EGFR mutant cell lines PC-9 or KT-4
with the neutralizing antibodies failed to inhibit the constitutive
phosphorylation of EGFR on Y1068. These observations suggest
that the constitutive phosphorylation of the mutant receptors is
not attributable to autocrine stimulation, although we are not able
to exclude a possible role for other EGFR ligands.
Ligand-induced EGFR dimerization is responsible for activation
of the receptor tyrosine kinase (4, 5). To determine whether mutant
receptors are constitutively dimerized, we treated EGFR wild-type
or mutant cell lines with a cross-linking agent before immunoblot
analysis with antibodies to EGFR. Whereas ligand-induced dimerization of wild-type EGFR was observed in A549 cells, receptor
dimerization in PC-9 and KT-4 cells, which express mutant
receptors, was apparent in the absence of ligand and was not
increased substantially by exposure of the cells to EGF
(Fig. 6B). These data indicate that ligand-independent receptor
dimerization is responsible for the constitutive activation of the
mutant forms of EGFR.

Discussion
The discovery of somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase
domain of EGFR and of their association with a high response rate
to EGFR-TKIs has had a substantial effect on the treatment of
advanced NSCLC (15–17, 20, 22). Asian patients with NSCLC seem
to have a higher prevalence of these mutations, ranging from 20%
to 40% (18, 20, 21, 43–45). We have now identified EGFR mutations

in three of eight newly established cell lines from Japanese patients
with advanced NSCLC. Characterization of these eight new cell
lines and eight previously established NSCLC lines revealed that,
consistent with previous observations (29, 31, 36), those cell lines
that harbor EGFR mutations are more likely to be sensitive to
gefitinib than are those without such mutations. Not all EGFR
mutant cell lines (e.g., H1650 and H1975) are sensitive to this
EGFR-TKI, however, suggesting the existence of additional determinants of gefitinib sensitivity. In addition to the L858R mutation
in exon 21 of EGFR , H1975 cells contain the T790M mutation in
exon 20, which has been shown to confer resistance to EGFR-TKIs
(38, 39). H1650 cells, which do not harbor mutations in EGFR other
than the exon 19 deletion, manifest loss of the tumor suppressor
phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10
(37), which may result in resistance to EGFR-TKIs. EGFR amplification in NSCLC cells has also been shown to correlate with a
better response to gefitinib (22, 25–27). Given that little is known
of the relation between EGFR mutation and amplification in
NSCLC, we examined the 16 NSCLC cell lines used in this study for
EGFR amplification by FISH. Four of the six cell lines with EGFR
mutations were found to be positive for gene amplification,
whereas none of the 10 mutation-negative cell lines manifested
EGFR amplification. This finding thus suggests that EGFR mutation
and amplification are linked. Cappuzzo et al. showed that 6 of 9
(67%) NSCLC patients with EGFR amplification also had EGFR
mutations (25). Furthermore, Takano et al. sequenced EGFR and
determined the EGFR copy number by real-time PCR analysis for
the tumors of 66 NSCLC patients (22); all of the patients with a high
EGFR copy number (z6.0 per cell) also had EGFR mutations.
Moreover, PCR analysis revealed selective amplification of the
mutant EGFR alleles in the patients with a high EGFR copy
number. Our sequencing electrophoretograms for the EGFR
mutant cell lines positive for EGFR amplification also revealed
that the mutant signals were dominant, and the wild-type sequence
was barely detectable (Fig. 1), indicative of selective amplification
of the mutant alleles. We used the recently proposed definition of
EGFR amplification as determined by FISH (25, 27) and found that
the pattern of gene amplification seemed to be dependent on the

Figure 6. Mechanism of constitutive
activation of EGFR in NSCLC cell lines.
A, effect of neutralizing antibodies
(Neut Ab ) on EGFR phosphorylation.
Serum-deprived NSCLC cells (A549, PC-9,
or KT-4) were incubated for 3 h with a
combination of neutralizing antibodies to
EGF, TGF-a, and EGFR and then for
15 min in the additional absence or
presence of EGF (100 ng/mL). Cell lysates
were then prepared and subjected to
immunoblot analysis with antibodies to the
Y1068-phosphorylated form of EGFR or
to total EGFR. B, EGFR dimerization.
Serum-deprived cells were incubated for
15 min in the absence or presence of
EGF (100 ng/mL), exposed to a chemical
cross-linker, lysed, and subjected to
immunoblot analysis with antibodies to

type of EGFR mutation; gene clusters were observed in cells with
the L858R mutation in exon 21, whereas an EGFR/chromosome
copy number ratio of z2 was detected in those with the small
deletion [del(E746-A750)] in exon 19. Together, these data support
the notion that EGFR mutation and amplification may be coselected for during the growth of NSCLC cells. The four cell
lines (PC-9, Ma-1, KT-2, and KT-4) positive for both EGFR
mutation and amplification were sensitive to gefitinib, suggesting
that EGFR amplification may increase sensitivity to gefitinib in
EGFR mutant cells.
Previous biochemical studies of cells transiently transfected with
vectors for wild-type or mutant forms of EGFR suggested that
EGFR mutations increase EGF-dependent receptor activation
(15, 30). Infection of NIH 3T3 cells with a retrovirus encoding
EGFR mutants showed that the mutant receptors are constitutively
activated and able to induce cell transformation in the absence
of exogenous EGF (32). We examined the activation status of
endogenous EGFRs in the six NSCLC cell lines that harbor EGFR
mutations. The H1650, PC-9, and Ma-1 cell lines, all of which
harbor the same exon 19 deletion, showed different patterns of
EGFR autophosphorylation in the COOH-terminal region of the
protein. EGFR autophosphorylation was ligand dependent in
H1650 cells, which are negative for EGFR amplification, whereas
Y1068 (but not Y845 and Y1173) was constitutively phosphorylated
in PC-9 and Ma-1 cells, both of which manifest EGFR amplification.
These results suggest that both EGFR mutation and amplification
may be required for constitutive activation of EGFR in NSCLC cells
that harbor the exon 19 deletion. In contrast, NSCLC cell lines
(H1975, KT-2, and KT-4) that harbor the L858R mutation exhibited
constitutive phosphorylation of EGFR at Y845, Y1068, and Y1173,
regardless of the absence or presence of EGFR amplification. It is
thought that EGFR mutations result in repositioning of critical

residues surrounding the ATP-binding cleft of the tyrosine kinase
domain of the receptor and thereby stabilize the interactions with
ATP and EGF-TKIs, leading to increased tyrosine kinase activity
and EGFR-TKI sensitivity (15, 23, 24). The differential activation
of EGFR mutants observed in the present study may result from
distinct conformational changes within the catalytic pocket caused
by the different types of EGFR mutation. NSCLC patients with
exon 19 deletions were recently shown to manifest longer overall
survival than did those with the exon 21 point mutation after
treatment with EGFR-TKIs, supporting the notion that the two
major types of mutant receptors have different biological
properties (46, 47).
Ligand-induced receptor dimerization underlies the activation
of receptor tyrosine kinases (4, 5). Chemical cross-linking revealed
that EGF binding to EGFR induced receptor dimerization in
A549 cells, which express only the wild-type form of the receptor.
In contrast, endogenous EGFRs in NSCLC cells harboring either
the exon 19 deletion or the point mutation in exon 21 of
EGFR were found to dimerize in the absence of ligand, suggesting
that the constitutive activation of the mutant receptors is attributable to ligand-independent dimerization. EGFR dimerization
was shown to be induced by interaction of quinazolines with
the ATP-binding site of the receptor in the absence of ligand
binding, suggesting that a change in conformation around the
ATP-binding pocket of EGFR is sufficient for receptor dimerization (35). Conformational changes induced by EGFR mutations
may therefore also trigger EGFR dimerization in EGFR mutant
cells.
In conclusion, we have found that EGFR mutation is closely
associated with EGFR amplification in NSCLC cell lines. Endogenous EGFRs expressed in NSCLC cells positive for both EGFR
mutation and amplification are constitutively activated as a result

of ligand-independent dimerization. Cells with the two most
common types of EGFR mutation also manifest different patterns
of EGFR autophosphorylation. Prospective studies are required to
determine the potential for exploitation of these EGFR alterations
in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.
