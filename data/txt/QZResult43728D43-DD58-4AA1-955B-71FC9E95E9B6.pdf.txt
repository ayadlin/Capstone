BACKGROUND. Although many patients take antioxidant dietary supplements during breast cancer treatment, the benefits of such supplementation are unproven. The authors of this report analyzed the prevalence of and factors associated with antioxidant supplement use during breast cancer (BC) treatment
among women who participated in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. METHODS. From 2002
through 2004, women with BC who had participated a case-control study from 1996 to 1997 were invited
to participate in a follow-up interview. Antioxidant supplement use was defined as any self-reported intake
of supplemental vitamin C, vitamin E, b-carotene, or selenium in individual supplements or multivitamins.
RESULTS. Follow-up interview participants were younger, more predominantly white, and of higher socioeconomic status than women who did not respond. Among 764 participants who completed the follow-up
interview, 663 (86.8%) reported receiving adjuvant treatment for their BC. Of those 663 women, 401
(60.5%) reported using antioxidants during adjuvant treatment: One hundred twenty of 310 women
(38.7%) used antioxidants during chemotherapy, 196 of 464 women (42.2%) used them during radiation,
and 286 of 462 women (61.9%) used them during tamoxifen therapy. Of 401 antioxidant users, 278 women
(69.3%) used high doses (doses higher than those contained in a Centrum multivitamin). The factors that
were associated with high antioxidant supplement use during treatment were higher fruit and vegetable
intake at diagnosis (relative risk [RR], 1.71; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.13-2.59), tamoxifen use (RR, 3.66;
95% CI, 2.32-5.78), ever using herbal products (RR, 3.49; 95% CI, 2.26-5.38), and ever engaging in mindbody practices (RR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.13-2.64). CONCLUSIONS. Given the common use of antioxidant supplements during BC treatment, often at high doses and in conjunction with other complementary therapies,
future research should address the effects of antioxidant supplementation on BC outcomes. Cancer

KEY WORDS: antioxidants, dietary supplements, breast cancer, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, hormonal
therapy.

An estimated 45% to 87% of patients with breast cancer

use antioxidant supplements after diagnosis.1-9 However,
to our knowledge, the characteristics of women who use
antioxidants specifically during treatment for breast cancer have not been described previously.
Many patients with breast cancer take antioxidant
supplements, because they believe antioxidants will protect them from the side effects of breast cancer treatment,
help prevent breast cancer recurrence, and improve their
overall health.7 However, the actual consequences of
using antioxidant supplements during cancer treatment
are poorly understood and controversial.10-18 In the past
few decades, the idea that antioxidant supplementation
could protect normal tissue from the adverse effects of
cancer treatments has become widespread.19
Radiation therapy and some chemotherapeutic
agents induce apoptosis by generating reactive oxygen species, which damage tumor cell DNA and disrupt mitochondrial membranes.20-22 Many medical and radiation
oncologists believe that antioxidant supplements interfere
with this process and that antioxidant use during treatment
may reduce therapeutic efficacy.14 However, the effects of
taking antioxidant supplements during cancer therapy on
cancer recurrence or mortality and the characteristics of
antioxidant users have not been well studied.18,23
We determined the prevalence and predictors of
antioxidant supplement use, taken as multivitamins and
as single vitamin supplements, during breast cancer treatment among women with breast cancer who participated
in the population-based Long Island Breast Cancer Study
Project (LIBCSP). To our knowledge, ours is the first
detailed study of antioxidant use during treatment in a
cohort study setting.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
The LIBCSP began as a federally mandated, populationbased, case-control study to investigate whether breast
cancer risk was associated with environmental exposures
3272

among women in Nassau and Suffolk counties in New
York State.24 A subsequent follow-up study was conducted among cases to determine whether environmental
exposures were associated with mortality. The LIBCSP
case-control study cases (n ¼ 1508) were women who
were diagnosed with a first primary in situ or invasive
breast cancer between August 1, 1996 and July 31, 1997.
Cases were identified by rapid ascertainment methods
through daily or weekly contact with local pathology
departments of hospitals known to diagnose and treat residents of Nassau and Suffolk counties with newly diagnosed breast cancer, including some hospitals in New
York City. Once a case was identified, her physician was
contacted to verify the diagnosis and to obtain permission
to contact the patient. Among eligible cases, the response
rate for the parent case-control study was 82.1%.
For the LIBCSP follow-up, which was conducted
between 2002 and 2004, interviewers attempted to conduct telephone interviews with all cases who previously
agreed to be contacted again (n ¼ 1414; 93.8%),24 and
1098 cases (77.7%) completed a full or short-form interview in person or by proxy. The study reported here is
based on the 784 cases (55.4%) who personally completed
the full follow-up interview.
Written, signed informed consent was obtained
from all participants before the beginning of the in-person
baseline interview. The study protocol was approved by
all institutional review boards of the collaborating
institutions.
Data Collection
Baseline case-control questionnaire

The baseline questionnaire was administered to
participants in their homes shortly after they were diagnosed (mean, 96 days) with a first primary breast cancer.
The questionnaire asked about known and suspected
risk factors for breast cancer (available at: http://epi.
grants.cancer.gov/LIBCSP/projects/Questionnaire.html;
accessed on October 10, 2008). A 101-item, modified
Block food frequency questionnaire was selfCancer

administered. Baseline questionnaire variables that were
used in the analyses presented here included age at diagnosis, race/ethnicity, education, annual household income,
marital status, body mass index, family history of breast
cancer, menopausal status at diagnosis, mammogram history, oral contraceptive use, hormone-replacement therapy
use, lifetime physical activity, smoking history, previous
alcohol use, and fruit and vegetable intake.
Follow-up questionnaire among cases

The follow-up questionnaire asked about breast cancer recurrence risk factors, including demographics,
health behaviors, medical history, first course of treatment
received, and other clinical variables. The questionnaire
included detailed questions about complementary and
alternative medicine (CAM) therapy use during 3 separate
periods: before, during, and after breast cancer diagnosis
and treatment. The CAM modalities that were assessed
included multivitamins, single vitamins, minerals, herbal
products, other over-the-counter health products, mindbody activities (eg, spirituality, support groups, meditation), special treatments (eg, biofeedback, colon cleansing,
hydrotherapy), alternative cancer clinics, special diets (eg,
vegan, macrobiotic, low-fat diets), and visits with CAM
practitioners. The analyses presented here focus on antioxidant supplement use during treatment. Analyses of other
CAM use will be presented in a separate article.
Study participants who reported ever using multivitamins were asked whether they used them during specific
phases of their treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and tamoxifen therapy. In addition, participants were asked how many tablets were
consumed per week since diagnosis. The questionnaire
asked about specific types of multivitamins: multivitamins
with minerals, multivitamins without minerals, antioxidant combination types with vitamins A, C, and E; stresstab types, women’s formula types; multivitamins with
herbs; and other multivitamins. For the current analysis,
we assumed that each multivitamin pill contained the
doses of specific micronutrients present in the commonly
used Centrum multivitamin circa 2002 (60 mg vitamin
C, 30 IU vitamin E, 20 lg selenium, 5000 IU b-carotene).25 To estimate the daily doses consumed during
treatment of vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and b-carotene from multivitamins, we multiplied the Centrum
dose of each individual micronutrient by the number of
Cancer

July 15, 2009

multivitamin tablets a participant reported taking per
week and dividing by 7.
Data were collected in a similar fashion on the use of
individual antioxidant supplements during breast cancer
treatment, including vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and
b-carotene. For each individual supplement, data were
collected on dose per tablet and number of tablets taken
per week since diagnosis and were used to estimate daily
doses consumed during treatment.
Less than 4% of participants were missing data on
individual antioxidant supplement use (b-carotene, 1.3%;
vitamin C, 2.5%; vitamin E; 3.5%, selenium, 2.4%). We
assumed that participants who reported taking 1 of these
supplements but who provided no information on dose
had taken the lowest dose. We conducted sensitivity analyses to determine whether assuming the median dose or
the highest dose would make any appreciable differences
in our results, and it did not.
To estimate individual intake of each antioxidant
during treatment (vitamin C, vitamin E, selenium, and
b-carotene), we added the daily dose values for the multivitamins and the individual supplements. Then, intake of
each supplement was categorized as none, low, or high.
High doses were defined as >60 mg vitamin C, >30 IU
vitamin E, >20 lg selenium, and >5000 IU b-carotene;
these cutoff points were based on the doses in a typical
Centrum multivitamin circa 2002. Between 1997 and
2004, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of
Medicine revised its nutrient intake recommendations,
now termed Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs).26,27 The
current DRIs are 90 mg vitamin C, 22 IU natural vitamin
E (33 IU synthetic vitamin E), and 55 lg selenium.28
There is no DRI for b-carotene.
We created a composite antioxidant index to summarize total intake of supplemental b-carotene, vitamin
C, vitamin E, and selenium during treatment. We computed a categorical variable with a range from 0 points
to 8 points based on scoring the intake of each antioxidant
as never (0), low (1), or high (2). The antioxidant index
itself was divided into 3 categories: none (score, 0), low
(score,1-4), and high (score, 5-8).
Medical records

Signed medical records release forms were obtained
from case women at the baseline and follow-up interviews.
Medical records were obtained from inpatient and
3273

Original Article

outpatient facilities involved in the diagnosis, treatment,
and follow-up of breast cancer cases. Medical records were
abstracted at baseline and at follow-up to ascertain tumor
characteristics and first course of treatment for the primary breast cancer diagnosis. For the 598 women who
had complete medical records data available on the first
course of treatment, the agreement between self-reported
breast cancer treatment and treatment recorded on the
medical record was high for chemotherapy (j ¼ 0.96),
radiation therapy (j ¼ 0.97), and hormone therapy (j ¼
0.92).29 Thus, for the current analyses, we used treatment
information collected through self-report during the
follow-up interview.

Statistical Analyses
Chi-square tests and Student t tests were used to evaluate
the statistical significance of the associations of the demographic, health behavior, clinical, and CAM use variables
with antioxidant supplement use during treatment. Multivariate logistic and polytomous regression analyses were
performed to identify independent predictors of antioxidant use, which were categorized as either none/any or
none/low dose/high dose. Model-building procedures
were performed in the following 3 basic steps. In Step 1,
candidate predictors were identified as the predictors that
were statistically significant (P < .10) in unadjusted analyses30 as well as any a priori confounders. Step 2 involved
fitting a full model that included all variables identified in
Step 1, in which variables were retained in the model if
the corresponding P value was <.05. Finally, in Step 3,
variables that were rejected in the first step were added
back to the model, 1 at a time, for reassessment and were
kept in the final model if the corresponding P value was
<.05. Tests of significance were based on the likelihood
ratio test statistic. Analyses were performed using Stata
software (version 9.2; StataCorp., College Station, Tex).

RESULTS
Respondents
In total, 784 individuals personally completed the full telephone interview. They were younger, more educated, more
likely to be white, and had higher household income than
women who did not respond to the follow-up question3274

naire (Table 1). Of 784 women, 764 provided data on antioxidant supplement use (Table 2). Their mean age at the
time of diagnosis with a first primary breast cancer was 56.3
years (11.4 years), and 94% were non-Hispanic whites.
Greater than 60% of the women had at least some college
education. In total, 555 of 764 respondents (72.6%) used
multivitamin or single antioxidant supplements before diagnosis, and the number of users increased to 650 of 764
(85.1%) after diagnosis. All 764 women underwent surgical treatment for their breast cancer, and 663 (86.8%) also
received adjuvant treatment: 310 (40.6%) received chemotherapy, 464 (60.7%) received radiation therapy, and 462
(60.5%) received tamoxifen. Of 663 women who received
adjuvant treatment, 560 (84.5%) reported using antioxidants after their breast cancer diagnosis, and 401 (60.5%)
specifically reported using antioxidants during their treatment. Women who received adjuvant treatment did not
differ from those who did not receive such treatment with
respect to antioxidant use after diagnosis (data not shown).

Factors Associated With Antioxidant Use
During Specific Treatments
Of 310 women who received chemotherapy, 120 women
(38.7%) used antioxidants during chemotherapy. Antioxidant use during chemotherapy was positively associated
with ever having used herbal products and high fruit and
vegetable intake before diagnosis (Table 3). Of 464
women who received radiation therapy, 196 (42.2%)
used antioxidants during radiation therapy. Antioxidant
use during radiation therapy was positively associated
with ever having used herbal products and having in situ
(as opposed to invasive) disease (Table 3). Of 462 women
who received tamoxifen treatment for their breast cancer,
286 (61.9%) used antioxidants during that treatment.
Antioxidant use during tamoxifen therapy was positively
associated with ever having used herbal products, lower
body mass index (<25 kg/m2), moderate lifetime alcohol
intake, and family history of breast cancer.

Antioxidant Supplement Dose Used
During Treatment
Of 401 women who used antioxidants during therapy,
342 (51.6%) used multivitamins, 199 (30%) used individual vitamin C, 215 (32.4%) used individual vitamin E,

which is a proxy for simultaneous high-dose use of multiple antioxidant supplements. In the polytomous model
for predicting levels of antioxidant use during treatment,
the strongest predictor low-dose antioxidant use during
treatment was tamoxifen use (Table 5). The strongest predictors of high-dose antioxidant use during treatment
were high fruit and vegetable intake before diagnosis,
tamoxifen use, ever using herbal products, and ever using
mind-body activities.

The majority of participants in our study were well
educated, non-Hispanic white, postmenopausal women
with high household incomes who engaged in other
health-oriented behaviors before diagnosis (eg, regular
physical activity, high fruit and vegetable intake, not
smoking), and we believe our results are generalizable to
similar populations. Almost all participants reported previous use of 1 or more forms of CAM. Most women who

reported antioxidant supplement use during treatment,
especially those who used high doses, also engaged in

much more likely ever to have used herbal products and
ever to have received tamoxifen therapy than women who
did not use antioxidant supplements.
Antioxidant supplement use appears to have been
more prevalent among the Long Island breast cancer
patients in our sample than among respondents to the

51% of women, including 62% of non-Hispanic white
women, reported using vitamins or minerals anytime in
the past year.31 However, in a literature review of women
who had a history of breast cancer, from 67% to 87%
reported using vitamins and minerals9; those rates are similar to our observations.
We observed a strong association between antioxidant supplement use and tamoxifen use. This association
may reflect tamoxifen users’ strategies to manage vasomotor symptoms associated with this therapy (eg, taking vitamin E supplements to help with hot flashes32). We did
not ask women about their motives for dietary supplement use during treatment; however, previous studies
have demonstrated that women may take supplements to
counteract toxicities due to breast cancer treatment.7
To our knowledge, this study is the first to report on
antioxidant use during specific phases of breast cancer treatment. A recent review identified 8 articles that reported on

Study indicated that 20% of breast cancer survivors used
high-dose vitamins during the 2 years before the assessment
(mean, 3.2 years postdiagnosis).6 Among Canadian breast
cancer patients (mean, 2.4 years postdiagnosis), 51%
reported ever using vitamins and minerals other than those
in a multivitamin; to treat symptoms associated with breast
cancer, 13.2% used vitamin E, 12.3% used vitamin C, and
Cancer

6% used b-carotene.8 Neither study reported on use during
specific breast cancer treatments.
Another strength of the current study is our cumulative antioxidant index and categorization of study participants as high-dose, low-dose, or nonusers of multiple
forms of antioxidants. We developed this approach to exposure measurement because antioxidants rarely are taken

alone and may have cumulative physiologic effects.
Although our categorization of antioxidant use as lowdose or high-dose was based on detailed questionnaire
data, at best, it is an approximation of actual intake. We
were conservative in calculating the specific doses of antioxidants consumed in multivitamins; therefore, we may
have underestimated some actual doses.
The main limitation of our study is its relatively low
response rate, especially compared with the high response
rate of the original LIBCSP case-control study. However,
we have complete first-hand follow-up questionnaire data
on 764 of 1414 women (55.4%) who agreed to be contacted again for the follow-up study, including the CAM
questionnaire. Our response bias analyses (data not
shown) revealed that women who completed the full questionnaire were of higher socioeconomic status than those
who did not. Because such women also are more likely
than others to use CAM,34 our study participants may
have been heavier users of antioxidants than breast cancer
patients in the general population.
The follow-up survey was conducted at least 5 years
after participants were diagnosed with a first primary
breast cancer. The passage of time may have led to poor
recall of supplement use before diagnosis and during treatment. Despite possible misclassification, our analyses
identified strong predictors of supplement use that are
consistent with those reported by other investigators.3,35,36
Data on the actual effects of antioxidant supplements during breast cancer treatment are limited.37 Some
studies of antioxidant supplement use during treatment of
other cancer sites have suggested harm.18 In a randomized
clinical trial of patients who were undergoing radiation
therapy for head and neck cancers, a-tocopherol supplementation (400 IU/day for 3 years beginning at the initiation of radiation therapy) was associated with a decrease
in both adverse side effects during treatment38 and overall
survival at 8 years.39 However, patients with head and
neck cancer may differ from breast cancer patients in
behaviors, such as tobacco use, that may be relevant to the
effects of antioxidants. The effects of antioxidant supplementation during treatment also may depend on the doses
and types of supplements, intake of fruits and vegetables,
tumor site and stage, type of treatment, and genetic polymorphisms in endogenous antioxidant enzymes.
Areas in which further research is needed include the
physiologic interactions between antioxidants and radia3280

tion therapy, chemotherapy, and hormone therapy;
whether there is a dose threshold above which an antioxidant exerts benefit or harm; and the long-term effect of
antioxidants on breast cancer recurrence and survival. Prospective observational studies and clinical trials need to
elucidate whether antioxidants affect treatment toxicities,
treatment efficacy, and recurrence and survival. Our data
suggest that many women diagnosed with breast cancer
who use antioxidant supplements also are engaging in
other behaviors that may affect their risk of recurrence,
and these behaviors should be accounted for in studies of
antioxidant supplements during treatment. The results of
these studies will shed light on whether or not patients can
use antioxidant supplements to enhance the effects of conventional treatment or alleviate its side effects without
adversely affecting their prospects for survival.
In summary, we observed that the majority of breast
cancer patients in Long Island, many of whom were of
high socioeconomic status, used antioxidants during treatment. We believe that oncologists should discuss supplement use and dosing with their patients. More
specifically, oncologists can inform patients that antioxidant supplements may dampen the effects of chemotherapy and radiation therapy but that clear evidence of
benefit or harm is not yet available.9,18,37
