Abstract

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cancer cell resistance to paclitaxel continues to be a major clinical problem. In this study, we
utilized miRNA arrays to screen for differentially expressed miRNAs in paclitaxel-resistant cell
lines established in vitro. We observed concordant upregulation of miR-135a in paclitaxelresistant cell lines representing three human malignancies. Subsequently, the role of miRNA-135a
was evaluated in an in vivo model of paclitaxel resistance. In this model, mice were inoculated
subcutaneously with a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line and treated with paclitaxel for a
prolonged period. In paclitaxel-resistant cell lines, established either in vitro or in vivo, blockage
of miR-135a sensitized resistant cell lines to paclitaxel-induced cell death. We further
demonstrated a correlation between paclitaxel response and miR-135a expression in paclitaxelresistant subclones that were established in vivo. The paclitaxel-resistant phenotype of these
subclones was maintained upon retransplantation in new mice as shown by decreased tumor
response upon paclitaxel treatment compared to controls. Upregulation of miR-135a was
associated with reduced expression of the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC). APC
knockdown increased paclitaxel resistance in parental cell lines. Our results indicate that paclitaxel
resistance is associated with upregulation of miR-135a both in vitro and in vivo, and is in part
mediated by miR-135a-mediated downregulation of APC.

Introduction
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taxanes, such as paclitaxel and docetaxel, exert their cytotoxic effect via interaction with
tubulin subunits, the building blocks of microtubules. Microtubules, formed by
polymerization of heterodimeric α- and β-tubulin subunits, play fundamental roles in a wide
range of cellular processes, such as maintenance of cell shape, cell signaling and cell
division (Gelfand and Bershadsky, 1991). By stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting their
disassembly to tubulin, taxanes interfere with proper formation of the mitotic spindle, which
leads to activation of the mitotic spindle check point and mitotic arrest (Schiff et al., 1979).
Drug-treated cells eventually escape mitotic arrest without assembling a normal mitotic
spindle. Depending on the cell type and concentration of taxanes used, these cells will
undergo apoptosis during mitotic arrest or as a result of the abnormal mitosis (Shi et al.,
2008). The mechanisms of taxane-induced apoptosis are poorly understood, but involve both
phosphorylation of Bcl-2 and activation of caspases-3 and -9 (Haldar et al., 1996; Perkins et
al., 1998).

Since the original US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of paclitaxel for
clinical use in advanced ovarian cancer in 1992, significant activity has been demonstrated
against a broad spectrum of solid malignancies. At present, taxanes, used either as singleagent or in combination with multiple other anti-cancer agents, are routinely used in the
adjuvant, neoadjuvant and metastatic setting for a wide range of solid malignancies,
including those of the breast, prostate, ovary, lung, and head and neck (Chu et al., 2005;
Dombernowsky et al., 1996; Mackler and Pienta, 2005; Wakelee et al., 2005). Despite their
widespread use, the clinical effectiveness of taxanes is limited by the emergence of taxaneresistant cancer cells, which ultimately leads to relapse and poor prognosis. Various
mechanisms have been implicated in acquired or secondary taxane resistance. The beststudied mechanism is the upregulation of P-glycoprotein and related drug efflux pumps
(Greenberger et al., 1988; Oguri et al., 2008). Other mechanisms may involve inadequate
interaction with spindle microtubules due to post-translational modification or altered
expression of tubulin and microtubule-associated proteins (McGrogan et al., 2008; Mozzetti
et al., 2005; Villeneuve et al., 2006) or functional aberrations in molecular pathways, such as
cell cycle control, the spindle assembly checkpoint and apoptosis (Anand et al., 2003;
McGrogan et al., 2008; Sudo et al., 2004, Patel et al., 2010). The contribution of each of
these mechanisms to clinical resistance remains uncertain (Patel et al., 2010).

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-protein coding RNAs that negatively
modulate expression of cognate mRNAs (He and Hannon, 2004). They act by targeting the
RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) to complementary sites within the 3′ untranslated
region (UTR) of their target mRNAs. Depending on the degree of base pairing between the
miRNA and the 3′ UTR, either degradation or translational repression of the targeted
mRNA will occur. Although they account for less than 1% of all human genes, miRNAs
have been estimated to regulate up to 30% of all protein-encoding genes (Xie et al., 2005).
Altered miRNA expression has been observed in various human malignancies (EsquelaKerscher and Slack, 2006; Iorio et al., 2005). Surprisingly, miRNA expression profiles can
predict tumor type and stage in human cancers with a better accuracy than the classical
mRNA expression profiles (Lu et al., 2005). The significant correlation between microRNA
expression patterns and compound potency in the NCI-60 panel of cell lines suggested that
microRNAs have a role in chemoresistance (Blower et al., 2007). Indeed, particular
miRNAs have been shown to be involved in tumor responsiveness to chemotherapies,
including paclitaxel (Cochrane et al., 2009; Fujita et al., 2010; Kovalchuk et al., 2008;
Sorrentino et al., 2008; Xia et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2010). All studies to date have been
performed in in vitro established paclitaxel-resistant cell lines. Although these studies have

provided valuable insight into the mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance, the clinical
implication is uncertain.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In the present study, we have utilized miRNA arrays to identify microRNAs associated with
the development of paclitaxel resistance in a panel of cell lines representing various human
solid malignancies, which were made paclitaxel-resistant in vitro. Subsequently, the in vivo
significance of the most discriminating miRNA was evaluated in a mouse model of
paclitaxel resistance.

Results
miRNA-135a is upregulated in various paclitaxel-resistant cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A screen to identify miRNAs involved in paclitaxel resistance was performed in four cell
lines that were made paclitaxel-resistant by continuous exposure to paclitaxel in vitro. We
identified 18 miRNAs to be dysregulated at least 2-fold in resistant compared to paclitaxelsensitive parental cells (Supplementary Figure S1). Supervised hierarchical clustering using
the 18 differentially expressed miRNAs clustered cell lines according to cancer type rather
than paclitaxel response (Figure 1). Since miR-135a was most highly and concordantly
upregulated in more than one paclitaxel-resistant cell line, i.e. 6.4-fold in PC-14TXT cells
and 9.1-fold in MES-SADX5 cells, we further investigated the role of miR-135a in paclitaxel
resistance. Quantitative real-time-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) examination of
miR-135a levels revealed a 1.5-fold upregulation in PC-14TXT cells (P=0.029) and a 28-fold
upregulation in MES-SADX5 cells (P<0.001), confirming our miRNA array results (Figure
2). In addition, we observed upregulation of miR-135a in two other paclitaxel-resistant cell
lines, i.e. 2-fold in A549TR (P=0.016) cells and 9.2-fold in SKOVTR cells (P=0.029),
indicating that the association between miR-135a and paclitaxel resistance is not cell linespecific (Figure 2).
Sensitivity to paclitaxel is modulated by changes in miR-135a expression in vitro

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

If paclitaxel resistance is causally related to miR-135a upregulation, then altering miR-135a
expression levels should modulate paclitaxel sensitivity. We found this to be true when
paclitaxel-resistant MES-SADX5 cells were transfected with a miR-135a inhibitor
(antagomir). In this experiment, cell survival was 102.2% in cells transfected with a
scrambled, non-targeting miRNA. In contrast, cell survival was reduced to 62.7% when the
same cells were transfected with a miR-135a inhibitor and then treated with paclitaxel
(Figure 3A, P=0.003). A similar result was found with A549TR cells (Figure 3A) where
transfection with miR-135 inhibitor resulted in a trend toward increased cell sensitivity
(P=0.054). To complement these studies, we elevated miR-135a levels in parental,
paclitaxel-sensitive cells with the expectation that this treatment would result in acquisition
of the resistant phenotype. In this experiment (Figure 3B), only 21.8% cell survival was
observed in the MES-SA cells after treatment with 100 nM paclitaxel for 72 hours. In
contrast, 43.6% of the cells survived paclitaxel treatment after transfection with a miR-135a
mimic. Again, as shown in Figure 3B, a similar trend was observed using the A549 parental
cells (p=0.051) in the presence and absence of the miR-135a mimic. Complete dose
response curves are provided in Supplementary Figure S2. Consistent with the above results,
when paclitaxel-induced apoptosis was determined by measurement of Annexin-positive
cells, miR-135a inhibition increased apoptosis in the paclitaxel resistant A549TR cells
(Figure 3C, P<0.001) and transfection with the miR-135a mimic decreased paclitaxelinduced apoptosis in the parental A549 cells (Figure 3D, P<0.001).

Overexpression of miR-135a leads to APC downregulation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It has been demonstrated that the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC)
is regulated by miR-135a (Nagel et al., 2008). We confirmed that miR-135a targeted the 3′
untranslated region of APC in both A549 (Figure 4A) and MES-SA cells (Figure 4B,
P=0.029). To further explore the role of miR-135a upregulation in paclitaxel resistance, we
examined APC expression in paclitaxel-sensitive and -resistant cell lines. Analysis of APC
mRNA expression levels revealed a 2.6-fold downregulation in A549TR cells (P<0.001) and
a 7-fold downregulation in MES-SADX5 cells (Figure 4C, P<0.001). A concordant
downregulation of APC was also observed at the protein level (Figure 4C). Transfection
with the anti-miR-135a inhibitor restored APC expression both at the mRNA (Figure 4D)
and protein level (Figure 4E).
miR-135a-induced paclitaxel resistance is partly mediated by APC downregulation

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To test the role of APC in the cellular response to paclitaxel, APC expression was
suppressed in parental A549 and MES-SA cells. Transfection with siRNA against APC
completely suppressed APC expression in both cell lines (Figure 5A) and led to a decrease
in paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines (Figures 5B and 5C). Similar results
were obtained in A549 cells stably expressing shRNA against APC (Figures 5D and 5E).
These results suggest that downregulation of APC may be partly responsible for the effects
of miR-135a on paclitaxel sensitivity in these cell lines.
The generation of paclitaxel-resistant cell lines in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To further establish the role of miR-135a in paclitaxel resistance, we adapted the A549
xenograft mouse model previously utilized in our laboratory (Patel et al., 2010). Briefly,
nude mice bearing subcutaneous A549 xenografts were injected intraperitoneally with either
vehicle or 15 mg/kg paclitaxel until tumors that responded initially started to regrow (Figure
6A). Representative tumor growth curves are shown in Figure 6B. Vehicle-treated tumors
show rapid progressive growth (green lines). Paclitaxel-treated tumors show two general
types of response: 7 out of 10 mice showed prolonged response (blue lines) and 3 out of 10
mice became paclitaxel-refractory, as demonstrated by an increase in tumor volume after
initial volume reduction during continued treatment (red lines). After 120 days of paclitaxel
treatment, control and paclitaxel-refractory tumors were harvested. Within two passages in
vitro, RNA was harvested for miRNA evaluation and determination of paclitaxel response.
Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the harvested cells were composed solely of
human A549 cells with no contaminating mouse cells (Supplementary Figure S3). Cell lines
established from paclitaxel-refractory tumors (black bars) were more resistant to paclitaxel
in vitro than either parental A549 cells (white bars) or vehicle-treated tumors (striped bars,
Figure 6C). Treatment of xenotransplanted mice with 10 and 12.5 mg/kg paclitaxel did not
generate any paclitaxel-refractory tumors (Supplementary Figure S4).
Cells selected for paclitaxel resistance remain resistant upon retransplantation
Tumor clone 20.2 (T20.2), the most paclitaxel-resistant tumor in the series, was transplanted
into 20 syngeneic mice. Half of these animals were treated with vehicle and half were
subjected to another round of i.p. treatment with 15 mg/kg paclitaxel. Tumor clone 28.2
served as a sensitive control in this experiment because: (1) it has an LC50 value for
paclitaxel that is similar to the parental A549 cells; (2) it is paclitaxel-naïve; and (3) it is
similar to T20.2, as both were previously grown in mice. As shown in Figure 7A, xenografts
established from T20.2 showed only a slight delay in tumor growth when tested with
paclitaxel, whereas xenografts established from the paclitaxel-sensitive control T28.2 shrank
substantially upon paclitaxel treatment. At the end of the experiment, the relative tumor
burden was reduced 4.5-fold in paclitaxel-sensitive control cells (P=0.003), but only 1.4-fold

in mice bearing T20.2 xenografts (Figure 7B). The decreased paclitaxel response of T20.2
compared to T28.2 in mice was associated with a decreased paclitaxel response in vitro
(Figure 7C, P=0.01). The maintenance of paclitaxel resistance upon retransplantation
suggests that paclitaxel resistance is associated with stable changes in the tumor rather than
in transient changes induced by exposure to the host environment.
miR-135a is upregulated in in vivo paclitaxel resistance

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In our in vitro experiments we established a role for miR-135a in the cellular response to
paclitaxel. To explore the role of miR-135a expression in vivo, we examined miR-135a
expression in three cell lines representing various degrees of paclitaxel resistance. Paclitaxel
resistance increased gradually from a median LC50 value of 1.14 nM in the parental A549
cells to 13.27 nM after one in vivo passage (P=0.030) and to 126.6 nM after re-injection
(P=0.008, Figure 8A). As shown in Figure 8B, decreased paclitaxel response is significantly
associated with increased miR-135a expression in tumors selected for paclitaxel resistance
in vivo. Cells have a median 1.9-fold higher expression after the initial in vivo passage
(round 1) and a 4.1-fold higher expression of miR-135a compared to the parental A549 cells
(P=0.004). The correlation between miR-135a expression and paclitaxel response was
observed in all cell lines derived from these tumors (Figure 8C, P<0.001). Transfection with
a miR-135a inhibitor modestly increased paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in paclitaxelresistant cells (Figure 8D). Furthermore, transfection of a miR-135a mimic suppressed
paclitaxel-induced cytotoxicity in paclitaxel-sensitive cells (Figure 8E). Together, these
results show that miR-135a is involved in the paclitaxel sensitivity of the cell lines
established after long-term exposure to paclitaxel in vivo.
miR-135a modulates tumor response to paclitaxel in vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We subsequently investigated the role of miR-135a in paclitaxel sensitivity in vivo. To this
aim, A549 cells stably expressing miR-135a were generated, which showed expression of
miR-135a approximating that of A549TR cells (P<0.01) (Figure 9A). As expected, miR-135a
knockdown attenuated paclitaxel-induced cell death (Figure 9B) and APC protein
expression (Figure 9C) relative to control transfected A549 cells in vitro. If overexpression
of miR-135a is causally involved in paclitaxel-resistance in vivo, tumors artificially
overexpressing miR-135a should show decreased paclitaxel sensitivity. To investigate this
hypothesis, A549 control cells and A549 cells stably overexpressing a miR-135a mimic
were inoculated subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. Paclitaxel treatment was given
three times a week for three weeks and tumor size in each group was monitored during the
course of treatment. At the end of the experiment, the relative tumor burden was reduced 5fold in A549 control cells (P<0.001). A549 cells overexpressing miR-135a showed
increased cell growth in vivo relative to control untreated cells. In vivo growth of miR-135a
overexpression was not reduced by paclitaxel exposure (Figure 9D). This result
demonstrates that miR-135a overexpression alone induces taxane resistance that is
maintained during tumor growth in vivo.

Discussion
Despite their widespread use, the clinical effectiveness of taxanes is limited by the
emergence of taxane-resistant cancer cells. Our current knowledge of the mechanisms
underlying paclitaxel resistance is largely derived from in vitro models where resistance is
induced by repeated or prolonged exposure of cultured cells to gradually increasing drug
concentrations. Although this methodology has imparted important knowledge, it has
potential disadvantages. First, cells in solid tumors in vivo tend to be more drug-resistant
than the same cells grown in a monolayer in vitro (Hoffman, 1991; Kobayashi et al., 1993).
This can be explained by various factors including decreased drug penetration, quiescence of

cells in deeper layers due to cell contact inhibition and hypoxia, or resistance arising from an
adaptive, reciprocal signaling between tumor cells and the surrounding microenvironment
(Meads et al., 2009; Pollard, 2004). Second, treatment in culture bears little resemblance to
in vivo pharmacokinetics, and does not allow the formation of active metabolites that may
be produced by metabolic activity. Third, the in vitro situation does not address the role of
the tumor microenvironment in the generation of drug resistance. To confirm the role of
miRNA-135a in paclitaxel resistance, we established a new in vivo mouse model of
paclitaxel resistance.
One way to circumvent this problem is to use mice that develop spontaneous tumors as a
consequence of conditional tissue-specific mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor
suppressor genes. Using this approach, Rottenberg et al. generated docetaxel-resistant
Brca1−/−;p53−/− mammary tumors (Rottenberg et al., 2007). In that study, tumors that
responded to paclitaxel were allowed to grow back to their original size before treatment
was resumed. We employed a different approach to the in vivo selection of paclitaxelresistant tumors. In our model, mice were inoculated with paclitaxel-sensitive tumor cells
and then treated with paclitaxel 3x weekly, consistent with current clinical practice.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Similar approaches have been employed by others to establish drug-resistant cell lines
(Okugawa et al., 2004; Starling et al., 1990; Teicher et al., 1990). Interestingly, contrary to
our model, resistance was not maintained when the established cell lines were exposed to
paclitaxel in vitro in these models. The authors suggested that drug resistance in in vivo
established cell lines may be dependent on an interaction between the tumor and the host
stromal tissues rather than changes at the cellular level. The maintenance of drug resistance
in vitro in our model could be explained by our selection method. Both Okugawa and
Teicher et al retransplanted cells in a new recipient mouse after a single drug dose. This
procedure was repeated six and ten times in a 6-month period, respectively. Starling’s mice
were treated 7 times in 8 weeks with a treatment-free interval of 3 weeks between the first
and second rounds of treatment. In contrast, our 3x weekly schedule for 42 weeks is
associated with a prolonged and continuous selective pressure. It has been proposed that
acquired drug resistance arises in a step-wise fashion as a consequence of random mutations
in tumor subclones (Goldie and Coldman, 1979). Some of these mutations will, by chance,
result in an increased survival in the presence of the drug being used, causing this subclone
to be selected during therapy. Resistance at the cellular level, without the necessity of
signals from the microenvironment, may occur at a later stage in the development of
resistance, explaining the maintenance of paclitaxel resistance ex vivo in our model. Since
clinical paclitaxel resistance usually takes several months to develop, our model may
represent a promising new paradigm elucidate mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

miR-135a is a member of the miR-135 subfamily, which is comprised of miR-135a and
miR-135b. Our current work demonstrates that upregulation of miR-135a correlates with the
acquisition of taxane resistance in cells selected for resistance either in vitro or in vivo.
Manipulation of miR-135a levels has a functional effect on taxane sensitivity in these lines.
Our results suggest that suppression of miR-135a may be a reasonable approach to
improving or prolonging drug sensitivity.
A recent report showed that the tumor suppressor gene APC is targeted by the miR-135a
family (Nagel et al., 2008). In the present paper we confirm that APC is a miR-135a target
and suggest miR-135a-mediated APC-downregulation as one possible mechanism for
miR-135a-induced taxane resistance. The best-known function of the APC protein is the
regulation of the Wnt signaling cascade through down-regulation of β-catenin (Giles et al.,
2003). Loss of APC expression leads to nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and inappropriate
activation of its target genes (Giles et al., 2003), including the growth-promoting genes c-

myc and cyclin-D1 and the anti-apoptotic gene survivin (Zhang et al., 2001). Collectively,
these changes can lead to reduced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Dikovskaya et al., 2007). In
addition, defects in the mitotic check point function have been associated with reduced
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (Anand et al., 2003; Sudo et al., 2004). APC regulates the
mitotic checkpoint by binding to microtubules during mitosis (Fodde et al., 2001) and
interacting with kinetochore-associated proteins (Aoki and Taketo, 2007; Kaplan et al.,
2001). Consequently, knockdown of APC by miR-135a may contribute to paclitaxel
resistance by decreasing apoptosis directly or indirectly by interference with the mitotic
spindle checkpoint.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Additional mechanisms for miR-135a induction of paclitaxel resistance are possible and
merit future testing. A recent report showed that treatment with the angiogenesis inhibitor
endostatin significantly improved the anti-tumor efficacy of paclitaxel in Lewis lung cell
carcinoma (Huang and Chen, 2010). This implicates increased angiogenesis in paclitaxel
resistance. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) is the key regulator of oxygen homeostasis
that controls angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glycolysis via transcriptional activation of
target genes under hypoxic conditions (Fong, 2008). Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha
inhibitor (HIF1AN) is a protein that binds to HIF-1α and inhibits its transcriptional activity
(Mahon et al., 2001). HIF1AN is a potential miR-135a target listed in both the TargetScan
and PicTar databases. Efforts to identify deregulation of other miR-135 targets in our model
are currently being pursued in our laboratory using a combination of genomic approaches
and in silico analysis of previously published datasets.
The role in paclitaxel resistance that we propose here for miR-135a offers the intriguing
possibility that clinical taxane resistance could be reversed by inhibiting miR-135a and/or its
deregulated downstream pathways. The use of anti-miRs as a therapeutic tool was
demonstrated in a recent study where intratumoral injection of anti-miR-221/222 led to a
reduction in tumor growth in a subcutaneous prostate cancer xenograft tumor model
(Mercatelli et al., 2008). Unfortunately, intratumoral injection is not feasible for the majority
of cancers and the success of systemic gene-based therapy has been limited to date by
fundamental barriers to RNA delivery. While new approaches to direct miRNA delivery are
being widely investigated, non-gene-based approaches may be feasible as well. For
example, several small-molecule antagonists capable of disrupting APC have been identified
(Lepourcelet et al., 2004) and represent potential alternatives to genetic manipulation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In conclusion, we demonstrate that miR-135a is involved in paclitaxel resistance both in
vitro and in vivo. In addition, we show that miR-135a-mediated paclitaxel resistance is in
part mediated by downregulation of APC. Although the present paper solely focused on
miR-135a, this miRNA represents only one of the many possible miRNAs that are likely to
be involved in paclitaxel resistance, as we found additional miRNAs to be upregulated in the
initial screening of our cell lines. Our in vivo model represents a promising new paradigm to
elucidate mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance. Future genomic or proteomic profiling of the
paclitaxel-resistant cell clones generated in this model is likely to generate important new
insights into the mechanisms of paclitaxel resistance.

RNA purification, labeling and hybridization

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Cells were harvested in log-phase growth and total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol with an additional
extraction with phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol 25:24:1. RNA integrity was assessed
with an Agilent Bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA). Two μg of total RNA was
labeled using the miRCURY™ Hy3™/Hy5™ labeling kit and hybridized on the miRCURY™
LNA Array v.11.0 (Exiqon, Vedbaek, Denmark) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
A common reference pool was constructed using RNA from all samples. Hybridization of
the Hy5-labeled pool to each array facilitates comparison of ratios across datasets (Yang and
Speed, 2002).
Processing of microarray data
Arrays were scanned using a laser confocal scanner (Agilent) and Hy3 (cell line) and Hy5
(common reference pool) signal intensities were calculated. Arrays were repeated if control
oligonucleotides did not produce signals within the expected range. In successful arrays,
signal intensities were background corrected using the normexp method (Ritchie et al.,
2007) with offset value k=10 and normalized using the global Lowess (locally weighted
scatterplot smoothing) regression algorithm (Cleveland, 1979). The LMR value was
calculated per miRNA probe set by log2-transformation of the mean Hy3/Hy5 ratio (MR).
The ΔLMR value, i.e. the difference between the LMR values in the parental cells and their
paclitaxel-resistant subclone, was subsequently used to calculate the fold change per miRNA
using the following formula: 2ΔLMR. For subsequent analysis, we used miRNAs which
passed the filtering criteria on variation across samples, i.e. LMR ≥ 2.0.
Establishment of in vivo paclitaxel-resistant cell lines

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Approximately 4×106 human A549 NSCLC cells were resuspended in 50% Matrigel (BD
Biosciences, Bedford, MA) and injected subcutaneously into the hind flanks of 8-wk old
male athymic (nu/nu) nude mice (Taconic Farms, Inc., Hudson, NY). When the average
tumor volume reached ~150 mm3, mice (N=10 per group) were randomly assigned to the
treatment or control group (Day 0). Mice were treated with vehicle (control) or 15 mg/kg
paclitaxel (Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Princeton, NJ) intraperitoneally 3 times per week (on
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays). This concentration of paclitaxel had minimal effects
on mouse morbidity as measured by mouse weight (Supplementary Figure S6). Tumor size
was determined by digital caliper measurements (length and width in mm), and tumor
volume (mm3) was estimated using the formula (length x width2)/2. Effects on tumor
growth rate were assessed per mouse by determining the tumor volume on the day of
treatment relative to the tumor volume on Day 0. Animals were sacrificed once morbidity
became evident or their tumor size exceeded 1000 mm3. Following the indicated treatments,
A549 tumors were removed, minced, and expanded in vitro without further exposure to
paclitaxel and stored in liquid nitrogen. All animal studies were conducted in accordance

Cytotoxicity assays
Cell growth inhibition was determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) bromide assay. Briefly, ~2.5×104 cells were plated in a 96-well
plate and paclitaxel was added in appropriate concentrations 24 hours later. An equivalent
amount of diluent (DMSO) was added to culture medium as a negative control. After 72
hours of drug incubation, 20 μl of MTT (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO; 20 mg/ml) was
added to each well. After incubation for an additional 4 hours, 200 μl of isopropanol-HCl
solution was added to each well to dissolve the cell pellets. Absorbance was determined
using a 96-well SpectraMax plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) at 560 nm
and 650 nm (background).
Quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR)

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Total cellular RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). In order to quantify
APC mRNA expression levels, cDNA was synthesized using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, VA, USA) and qRT-PCR were carried out using iQ
SYBR Green master mix (Bio-Rad). Primer sequences used are: APC, 5′GGAAGCAGAGAGAAAGTACTGGA-3′ (sense) and 5′-CTGAAGTTGAGCGT
AATACCAG-3′ (antisense), GAPDH, 5′-GTATTGGGCGCCTGGTCACC-3′ (sense) and
5′-CGGGAAGATG GTGATGG-3′ (antisense). Expression of miR-135a and 5S sRNA as a
reference was analyzed by the mirVana™ qRT-PCR miRNA Detection Kit (Ambion/
Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX) in conjunction with real-time PCR with SYBR Green I
(Bio-Rad). All reactions were conducted in triplicate in a LightCycler® 480 Real-Time PCR
System (Roche, Indianapolis, IN). Gene expression was calculated relative to GAPDH (for
APC) or 5S rRNA (for miR-135a) using the comparative cycle time (Ct) method.
Transfections and luciferase assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Double-stranded RNA oligos representing a mature sequence that mimics endogenous
miR-135a, anti-miR-135a designed to inhibit endogenous miR-135a, and anti-miR negative
control were all obtained from Ambion and were transfected into cell lines at ~50%
confluence at 30 nM concentration with siLentFect (Bio-Rad). For luciferase activity
analysis, cells were seeded in 96-well plates and 100 ng Luc-APC-3′UTR reporter vector
(SwitchGear Genomics, Menlo Park, CA) and 30 nM miR-135a mimic or 30 nM nontargeting control were cotransfected with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). An empty
vector, containing random genomic fragments served as a negative control. The next day,
luciferase activity was measured using the Dual-Glo® Luciferase assay system (Promega,
Madison, WI). For siRNA-mediated APC knockdown, a siRNA against human APC and a
scrambled non-targeting siRNA (ON-Target PLUS Smartpool, Dharmacon) were transfected
with Dharmacon Transfection reagent I into A549 cells before analyzing for protein
expression at 48 hr post-transfection. For the paclitaxel dose response, cells were re-seeded
24h after transfection and treated with paclitaxel the next day and harvested 48 hr posttreatment using MTT assay. In generating A549 cells stably expressing miR-135a,
expression plasmids for human miRNA-135a and its non-targeting control (Origene,
Rockville, MD) were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000, before selection with 750 μg/
ml Neomycin.
Annexin V assay
Annexin V/7-amino-actinomycin D labeling was performed according to the manufacturer’s
instructions (BD Pharmingen, 559763) and samples were analyzed by flow cytometry.

Briefly, cells were treated for 48–72 hours with either vehicle or 100 nM paclitaxel. Cells
were trypsinized and washed with PBS before resuspending in assay binding buffer.
Annexin V and 7-amino-actinomycin labeling was performed at room temperature for 15
minutes before analysis by flow cytometry (BD FACScan).
Western blot and immunocytochemical studies
Protein was extracted and the protein content was determined using the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay Kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Protein samples (50 μg)
were fractionated by SDS–PAGE (7% polyacrylamide gels) and transferred to PVDF
membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The samples were incubated overnight at 4°C with a
primary antibody directed against the C-terminus of APC (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa
Cruz, CA). Bound secondary HRP-conjugated antibodies were detected using the ECL
detection system (Amersham/GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA). Immunofluorescence for APC
was carried out on cells seeded on round glass coverslips coated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin
(BD Biosciences) in 24-well plates. Prior to staining, cells were treated with 30 nM of
miRNA inhibitor. At the end of treatment, cells were washed with ice-cold PBS containing 1
mM MgCl2 and 1 mM CaCl2. Cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde (Sigma) for 15
minutes at room temperature and stained for APC (1:50) with the primary antibody for 1 hr
followed by extensive washing and incubation with secondary antibody (Alexa 488conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG, 1:1000) in the dark for 30 minutes.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

(A) A suspension of A549 cells was injected subcutaneously into the flank of a nude mouse.
When the average tumor volume was at least 120 mm3, vehicle or paclitaxel (15 mg/kg) was
administered i.p. every other day. Treatment was continued until tumors reached
approximately four times their initial volume. Paclitaxel-refractory as well as vehicle-treated
tumors were digested with collagenase and cultured in vitro. (B) Tumor growth was
determined as the tumor volume on the day of treatment relative to the tumor volume at the
start of treatment and presented as a ratio. Tumors treated with vehicle are shown in green,
tumors responsive to paclitaxel in blue and tumors with continuous growth in the presence
of paclitaxel in red. Each line represents the growth of an individual tumor (T) in an
individual mouse (indicated by a number). Curves for representative tumors per group are
shown. (C) Vehicle-treated tumors (hatched bars) or paclitaxel-refractory tumors (black
bars) were harvested from mice and used to generate two cell lines per tumor. The indicated
cell lines were cultured in vitro and cell viability was assessed 72 h after paclitaxel addition
using the MTT assay. Bars represent average LC50 ± s.e.m. from triplicate experiments. The
most resistant and sensitive cell lines in vitro, indicated with a red checkmark, were selected
for reinjection.

(A) Tumor cell lines established after an initial round of inoculation and treatment with
either vehicle (blue lines, T28.2) or 15 mg/kg paclitaxel (red lines, T20.2) were harvested
during log-phase growth and reinjected subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice. When
the average tumor volume was ~120 mm3, vehicle (open circles or squares) or 15 mg/kg
paclitaxel (closed circles or squares) was administered i.p. every other day. Treatment was
continued until tumors reached approximately four times their initial volume. Each curve
represents the average tumor growth ± s.e.m. for 10 mice per group. (B) Relative tumor
burden at the end of the experiment. Each bar represents the average tumor growth ± s.e.m.
for 10 mice per group. NS: not significant, *: P<0.05 as determined by Wilcoxon’s rank sum
test. (C) Tumors were harvested, cultured in vitro and cell viability was assessed using the
MTT assay. Values are presented as percentage of cell survival in paclitaxel-treated cells
relative to untreated cells. White bars represent LC50s from tumor cell lines established from
T28.2 tumors treated with vehicle. Black bars represent LC50s from cell lines established
from T20.2 tumors treated with paclitaxel. Shown are the mean ± s.e.m. of two independent
experiments, each performed in triplicate. *:P<0.05 as determined by Wilcoxon’s rank sum
test.

(A). The parental A549 cells, a cell line that became refractory during in vivo treatment with
paclitaxel (T20.2 round 1) and the same cell line established after yet another round of in
vivo paclitaxel treatment (T20.2 reinjection) were treated with paclitaxel and cell viability
was assessed using the MTT assay. Represented are average LC50 ± s.e.m. determined by
MTT assay for parental A549 cells (white boxes), **:P<0.001, *: P<0.05 as determined by
Wilcoxon’s rank sum test for T20.2 round 1 cells (hatched boxes) and for T20.2 re-injection
cells (filled boxes). (B) The expression of miR-135a was examined in these cells by realtime quantitative PCR. *: P<0.05 as determined by Wilcoxon’s rank sum test. (C) The
expression of miR-135a was examined in the cell lines established in vivo. The correlation
between paclitaxel response and miR-135a expression was calculated using the Spearman’s
rank test. (D–E) The paclitaxel-resistant cell line T800.1 (D) or the paclitaxel-sensitive
T824.1 cell line (E) established after two rounds of treatment with vehicle were transfected
with a scrambled non-targeting miRNA (control), a miR-135a inhibitor (inhibitor) in the
resistant cells or a miR-135a mimic (mimic) in the sensitive cells. Subsequently, cells were
treated with the indicated concentrations of paclitaxel and cell viability was assessed using
the MTT assay. Values are presented as percentage of cell survival in paclitaxel-treated cells
relative to untreated cells. Shown are the mean and s.e.m. of two independent experiments,
each performed in triplicate.

Figure 9. Overexpression of miR-135a confers paclitaxel resistance in A549 cells in vivo

A549 cells stably expressing either non-targeting premiR (A549-control) or premiR-135a
(A549-miR-135a) were generated. (A) miR-135a expression level in A549-control and miR-135a was determined and compared with A549 and A549TR cells using quantitative
real time PCR analysis. *: P<0.01. (B) Paclitaxel response of A549-control and A549premiR-135a cells was determined using the MTT assay. (C) APC protein expression was
examined using Western blot analysis in A549-control and -premiR-135a cells. (D) A549control and -premiR-135a cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the flanks of nude mice.
Paclitaxel treatment was given three times a week for three weeks. The tumor size in each
group was measured during the course of treatment and was calculated relative to the size
prior to treatment initiation. Each curve represents the average tumor growth ± s.e.m. for 10
mice per group. *: P<0.05, **: P<0.001 as determined by Wilcoxon’s rank sum test.
