Data demonstrating the superiority of nilotinib over imatinib in the frontline treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) and ongoing studies with dasatinib and bosutinib are rapidly changing the treatment landscape for CML. In
this review, the authors discuss currently available therapies for CML, focusing on mechanisms of resistance to imatinib and treatment strategies to overcome resistance. Relevant articles were identified through searches of PubMed
and abstracts from international hematology/oncology congresses. Additional information sources were identified
from the bibliographies of these references and from the authors’ own libraries and expertise. In vitro 50% inhibitory
concentration (IC50) data alone are not sufficient to guide the choice of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) in the presence of a mutant breakpoint cluster region-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL) clone,
because there is a lack of data regarding how well such IC50 values correlate with clinical response. A small subset of
BCR-ABL mutant clones have been associated with impaired responses to second-generation TKIs (tyrosine to histidine mutation at codon 253 [Y253H], glutamic acid to lysine or valine mutation at codon 255 [E255K/V], and phenylalanine to cysteine or valine mutation at codon 359 [F359C/V] for nilotinib; valine to leucine mutation at codon 299
[V299L] and F317L for dasatinib); neither nilotinib nor dasatinib is active against the threonine to isoleucine mutation
at codon 315 (T315I). For each second-generation TKI, the detection of 1 of a small subset of mutations at the time of
resistance may be helpful in the selection of second-line therapy. For the majority of patients, comorbidities and drug
safety profiles should be the basis for choosing a second-line agent. Clinical trial data from an evaluation of the
response of specific mutant BCR-ABL clones to TKIs is needed to establish the role of mutation testing in the manC 2010 American Cancer Society.

The 2001 approval in the United States of imatinib (Glivec/Gleevec; formerly STI571; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East
Hanover, NJ), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) that targets the breakpoint cluster region-v-abl Abelson murine leukemia
viral oncogene homolog (BCR-ABL), started a new paradigm for the treatment of newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive, chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). In the International Randomized Study of
Interferon and STI571 (IRIS) trial, imatinib demonstrated superiority to combined interferon-a plus cytarabine and produced significantly higher rates of hematologic response and cytogenetic response (CyR), better tolerability, and a lower
likelihood of progression to accelerated phase (AP) or blast crisis (BC).1 Long-term follow-up of the IRIS trial has demonstrated durable responses, prolonged survival, and a low risk of progression among imatinib-treated patients.2
Strategies for Overcoming Resistance/Intolerance to Imatinib
Although high response rates are observed in patients who receive imatinib treatment, some patients (approximately
33%)2 are refractory to therapy. Patients are classified with 2 types of resistance: primary and secondary. Primary

resistance is defined as a lack of response and is subdivided
further into primary hematologic resistance and primary
cytogenetic resistance.3,4 Hematologic resistance occurs in
2% to 4% of patients,5 whereas cytogenetic resistance is
more common and occurs in 15% to 25% of patients.5
Mutations in BCR-ABL rarely are responsible for primary
resistance.6 Elevated transcript levels of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 1/cyclooxgenase 1 (PTGS1/COX1),
which encodes an enzyme that metabolizes imatinib, may
be associated with primary resistance. Thus, PTGS1/
COX1 may serve as a biomarker to identify patients with
primary resistance to imatinib.7 Secondary resistance is
defined by the achievement and then subsequent loss of a
hematologic response or CyR.
Multiple factors may contribute to imatinib resistance, including altered intracellular drug availability
caused by drug influx and efflux transporters. Overexpression of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette
(ABC), subfamily B, member 1 (ABCB1) gene, which encodes the P-glycoprotein drug efflux pump, has been
observed in imatinib-resistant cell lines,8,9 and the addition of PSC833 (valspodar), a P-glycoprotein inhibitor,
can increase the sensitivity of resistant patient-derived
CML cells to imatinib.8 In addition, a study of 33 patients
who were receiving imatinib demonstrated that those who
did not achieve at least major cytogenetic remission and
those who experienced disease progression had P-glycoprotein overexpression.10 Imatinib also is a substrate for
the drug-efflux transporter ABC subfamily G, member 2
(ABCG2),11,12 but it is not a substrate for the multidrugresistance protein 1 (MRP-1).9 Low activity of the drugintake protein human organic cation transporter 1
(hOCT-1) has been associated with suboptimal cytogenetic and molecular responses to imatinib.13-15 Unlike
imatinib, the efficacy of nilotinib is not affected by P-glycoprotein or hOCT-1 expression,16,17 although nilotinib
is a high-affinity substrate for ABCG2.11,17 Overexpression of P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 can confer resistance
to dasatinib,17 but dasatinib is not a substrate for hOCT1.18 Bosutinib is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein or
ABCG2.17 At higher concentrations, imatinib, nilotinib,
dasatinib, and bosutinib all can inhibit both P-glycoprotein and ABCG2 in vitro.11,17
Multiple strategies to overcome failure on standarddose (400 mg daily) imatinib are under investigation.
These strategies include the dose escalation of imatinib,
the switch to a second-generation TKI, or, for patients
with secondary resistance because of the threonine to isoleucine mutation at codon 315 (T315I), allogeneic stem

cell transplantation in eligible patients or a clinical trial.
It has been demonstrated that imatinib dose escalation
to 600 mg or 800 mg daily is effective and safe in
patients who have mutations with high sensitivity to imatinib.19-22 Dasatinib and nilotinib currently are approved
for the treatment of patients with CML who have developed resistance or intolerance to imatinib and other previous therapies.23,24
Dasatinib (Sprycel; Bristol-Myers Squibb, Princeton, NJ) is an orally bioavailable, multikinase inhibitor25
that currently is approved for the treatment of imatinibresistant or imatinib-intolerant CML in all phases and for
the treatment of Ph-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).24 The efficacy of dasatinib in imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant disease has been evaluated in
several trials. In the SRC/ABL Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition
Activity Research Trials of Dasatinib in Chronic Phase
Patients (START-C), dasatinib induced responses in
most patients (N ¼ 387) and had acceptable tolerability,
although grade 3/4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia
were experienced in 49% and 48% of patients, respectively.26 The most common (>20% patients) nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) were diarrhea, headache,
fatigue, dyspnea, pleural effusion, rash, and nausea.
In a subsequent phase 3 dasatinib dose-optimization
study, efficacy was similar between patients who received
100 mg once daily and those who received 70 mg twice
daily, and lower AE rates were observed in the patients
who received 100 mg dasatinib once daily.27 After a minimum follow-up of 2 years, the progression-free survival
(PFS) rate was 81%, and the overall survival (OS) rate was
90% for patients who received 100 mg dasatinib once
daily.27 This dose is now approved for patients with
CML-CP.24 In patients with CML in AP or BC, comparable efficacy and better tolerability were observed with
dasatinib doses of 140 mg once daily compared with
70 mg twice daily.28 Consequently, 140 mg once daily is
now the approved dose of dasatinib for patients with
advanced phase disease.24
Preliminary results recently have become available
from the phase 3 randomized Dasatinib Versus Imatinib
Study in Treatment-Naive CML Patients (the DASISION trial), which is comparing 100 mg once daily dasatinib with 400 mg once daily imatinib.29 In that trial,
dasatinib had superior complete CyR (CCyR) rates and
major molecular response (MMR) rates compared with
imatinib. The rate of confirmed CCyR by 12 months,
which was the primary endpoint of the trial, was 77%
in the dasatinib arm versus 66% in the imatinib arm

1801

Review Article

(P ¼ .007). Progression rates were similar between the 2
arms. More deaths occurred on the dasatinib arm (10
deaths vs 6 deaths, respectively), and the estimated OS
rate at 12 months was 97% for dasatinib-treated patients
and 99% and imatinib-treated patients. Rates of discontinuation were similar for the dasatinib and imatinib
arms, and dasatinib generally was well tolerated. These
results are supported by an independent phase 2 trial with
dasatinib in newly diagnosed patients that currently is
ongoing at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).30
Nilotinib (Tasigna; Novartis Pharmaceuticals) is a
rationally designed BCR-ABL inhibitor that currently is
approved for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients who have CML-CP and CML-AP at a dose of
400 mg twice daily.23 In clinical trials with up to 24
months of follow-up, nilotinib has demonstrated efficacy
and safety in patients with CML-CP and CML-AP.31-33
At 24 months of follow-up, nilotinib induced responses
in most of the CML-CP patients, including a major CyR
(MCyR) in 59% of patients, a CCyR in 44% of patients,
and an MMR in 28% of patients.31 The median PFS has
not been reached. The estimated OS rate at 24 months
was 87%.31 In general, nilotinib was well tolerated in the
phase 2 registration study and in the expanded access
study (Expanding Nilotinib Access in Clinical Trials
[ENACT]); the most common grade 3/4 AEs associated
with therapy were thrombocytopenia (20%-33% of
patients), neutropenia (13%-31% of patients), elevated
bilirubin (7% of patients), and elevated serum lipase (5%15% of patients).31,34 Nilotinib has minimal cross-intolerance with imatinib.35
Nilotinib also has demonstrated promise as frontline
therapy in patients with CML-CP.36-39 In the Evaluating
Nilotinib Efficacy and Safety in Clinical Trials of Newly
Diagnosed Philadelphia Chromosome-Positive CML
Patients (the ENESTnd study) study, nilotinib (300 mg
or 400 mg twice daily) was compared with imatinib (400
mg daily) in 846 patients with newly diagnosed CMLCP. At 12 months of follow-up, the patients who received
nilotinib had superior rates of MMR, CCyR, and undetectable BCR-ABL transcript levels (0.0032% International Scale [IS]; 4.5-log reduction).36 The MMR rate at
12 months, which was the primary endpoint of the study,
was 44% for nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 43% for nilotinib 400 mg twice daily, and 22% for imatinib (P < .0001
for imatinib vs both nilotinib doses).36
It is noteworthy that patients who received nilotinib
had a significant improvement in the time to progression

1802

to AP/BC (P ¼ .01 and P ¼ .004 for nilotinib 300 mg
twice daily and 400 mg twice daily vs imatinib, respectively) at a time early in therapy when the risk of progression on imatinib is greatest.36 These superior response
rates and progression advantage were maintained at a median follow-up >18 months, with progression to AP/BC
observed in 0.7%, 0.4%, and 4.2% of patients on nilotinib 300 mg twice daily, 400 mg twice daily, and imatinib,
respectively, and with OS rates of 98.5%, 99.3%, and
96.9%, respectively.40,41
Low rates of grade 3/4 AEs were observed during the
trial. The most common AEs were neutropenia (12% of
patients who were receiving 300 mg nilotinib twice daily,
10% of patients who were receiving 400 mg nilotinib
twice daily, and 20% of patients who were receiving imatinib) and thrombocytopenia (10% of patients who were
receiving 300 mg nilotinib twice daily, 12% of patients
who were receiving 400 mg nilotinib twice daily, and 9%
of patients who were receiving imatinib).36,40,41 The
results from the ENESTnd trial confirm the findings of
independent phase 2 studies of frontline nilotinib treatment in patients with newly diagnosed CML that was
conducted by the All-Ireland Cooperative Oncology
Research Group,39 MDACC,38 and the Italian Group for
Adult Hematologic Diseases.37 Nilotinib is now approved
by the US Food and Drug Administration for the frontline treatment of CML.
Mutations in BCR-ABL
Mutations in the BCR-ABL kinase domain account for
50% to 90% of the imatinib resistance observed in
patients.19,42,43 Structurally, the ABL kinase domain is
made up of a highly conserved P-loop, catalytic domain,
and activation loop. A mutation can affect imatinib binding in 2 ways: direct inhibition by altering an amino acid
involved in binding the drug to the kinase (eg, the T315I
mutation, the phenylalanine to leucine mutation at codon
317 [F317L], and the phenylalanine to cysteine or valine
mutation at codon 359 [F359C/V])42,44 or indirect inhibition by altering BCR-ABL protein conformation (eg,
the glycine to glutamic acid mutation at codon 250
[G250E], the glutamine to histidine mutation at codon
252 [Q252H], the tyrosine to histidine mutation at codon
253 [Y253H], and the glutamic acid to lysine or valine
mutation at codon 255 [E255K/V]).42 The T315I mutation is identified in 4% to 15% of imatinib-resistant
patients45 and commonly is called the gatekeeper mutation, because its structural effect confers resistance to imatinib and to the second-generation TKIs nilotinib and

dasatinib.46 The T315I mutation forms a hydrogen bond
with imatinib through the insertion of a bulky isoleucine,
which is thought to disrupt hydrogen bonding and, thus,
sterically hinder imatinib binding to BCR-ABL.47,48 In
addition, the T315I mutation is associated with an
increased affinity for ATP that may contribute to
resistance.49,50
Mutational Status and Response to Therapy
In vitro mutation data: imatinib

The presence of a BCR-ABL mutation does not necessarily lead to clinical resistance; in fact, the extent of resistance depends on the sensitivity of the specific
mutation to imatinib.51 In addition, potency observed in
vitro does not necessarily translate to an in vivo response,
in part because in vitro assays do not directly predict in
vivo plasma or target cell concentrations of compounds.52
In vivo mutation data: imatinib

Data are conflicting about the prognostic significance of BCR-ABL mutations in patients. In several retrospective analyses of patients with CML-CP who
developed resistance, mutations in the P-loop (excluding
residue 244) and in T315I were associated with worse
PFS and OS.20,53-55 In contrast, a study by Jabbour et al56
at MDACC indicated that P-loop mutations had no effect
on OS. The treatment that those patients received after
imatinib failure may explain the conflicting findings. For
example, the study by Branford et al53 was conducted
before the approval of dasatinib and nilotinib, whereas
patients in the MDACC study56 received a second-generation TKI after imatinib failure.
Baseline mutation screening for patients with newly
diagnosed CML has demonstrated no benefit for predicting response57 and should not be used routinely. In a
study that used highly sensitive DNA sequencing techniques, among patients who received imatinib, no correlation was observed between baseline mutation status and
response (PFS or OS).57 Additional work has confirmed
that the identification of mutations before therapy does
not predict insensitivity to imatinib.58
In vitro mutation data: Second-generation and
third-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors

In the case of imatinib resistance, the utility of using
in vitro mutation data to select a second-generation TKI
is a topic of much debate. Recently, the activities of imatinib, bosutinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib against 18 BCRABL mutations spanning the protein were assessed in vitro

by Redaelli et al.59 The 8 most commonly mutated amino
acids (T315I; Y253F/H; the glutamic acid to aspartic
acid, lysine, arginine, or valine mutation at codon 255
[E255D/K/R/V]; the methionine to threonine mutation
at codon 351 [M351T]; the glycine to alanine or glutamic
acid mutation at codon 250 [G250A/E]; F359C/L/V; the
histidine to proline or arginine mutation at codon 296
[H396P/R]; and M244V), which are identified in 85% of
patients with mutations, were included in the analysis.60
The mutations were stratified according to IC50 values as
sensitive, moderately resistant, resistant, or highly resistant.59 The authors of that report concluded that the data
offered physicians a tool for selecting a patient-tailored
TKI therapy.59 Laneuville et al42 offered a contrasting
view of the use of in vitro data to predict in vivo response,
arguing that the in vitro potency data do not take into
account other relevant factors, such as whether drug exposure is adequate to block BCR-ABL in vivo. They also
noted that the IC50 table published by Redaelli et al49 did
not allow a side-by-side comparison of data, because the
columns for each inhibitor were normalized to the data
within that column. Furthermore, when the ratio of the in
vivo maximum drug concentration to 50% growth inhibition (Cmax/GI50) of in vitro CML cell colonies values
were plotted for each mutation and compared with published CyR rates for patients who had these mutations, a
poor correlation was observed between in vitro predictions of TKI efficacy toward particular BCR-ABL mutant
clones and clinical data (Fig. 1). However, clinical data
regarding the efficacy of TKIs against most BCR-ABL
mutant clones are limited. In addition, proposals to use
these IC50 values for the selection of second-generation
therapy have not been prospectively evaluated. Furthermore, IC50 values differ among publications. Caution
should be applied when making clinical decisions based
on the detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with
CML.
Mutation Status and Response to Therapy: In
Vivo Mutation Data With Second-Generation
Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors
In-depth analyses of the effect of mutations on responses
to both dasatinib and nilotinib have been performed using
data from the clinical trials of these drugs. Of 1043
patients who received treatment with second-line dasatinib in phase 2/3 trials, 39% had a pre-existing BCR-ABL
mutation, including 48% of 805 patients who had either
imatinib resistance or a suboptimal response.61 Despite
this high prevalence of mutations at baseline, patients

despite similar Cmax/GI50 values, clinical responses differed

with imatinib resistance and patients who had a suboptimal response exhibited similar responses to dasatinib
regardless of the presence or absence of baseline mutations
(MCyR rate: 55% vs 58%, respectively; CCyR rate: 40%
vs 41%, respectively). Rates of PFS and OS also were
comparable between patients with and without baseline
mutations. To further analyze responses according to
mutation status, patients were stratified according to the
in vitro IC50 value of their mutation(s). Patients who had
the T315I mutation were excluded from the analyses.
Specific mutations with an IC50 >3 nm were associated
with lower rates of CCyR, including F317L (1 of 14
patients; 7%), Q252H (1 of 6 patients; 17%), V299L
(0 of 1 patient; 0%), and L384M (0 of 2 patients; 0%).
However, several patients (n ¼ 75) who had a variety of
mutations with IC50 values >3 nM had favorable

1804

responses to dasatinib.61 In a separate study, F317L mutations were detected in 12 of 99 patients who had mutations after imatinib failure.62 Three of those 12 patients
were treated with dasatinib, and none achieved a CCyR.
Indeed, the best response was a partial hematologic
response in 1 patient and a complete hematologic
response in 2 patients (who were lost to follow-up after 10
months and 12 months). Furthermore, F317L was
detected in 8 of 16 patients who had new mutations after
dasatinib failure.62 Two patients were rescued with a
higher dose of imatinib, and the remaining 6 patients
responded to nilotinib.
To examine the impact of mutations on responses to
nilotinib at 400 mg twice daily, patients with available
mutation data who had received second-line nilotinib in
the phase 2 registration study (n ¼ 281) were stratified
into the following 3 groups: patients with no mutations,
patients with sensitive mutations, and patients with less
sensitive mutations (ie, with IC50 values >150 nM;
Y253H, E255V/K, and F359V/C). Patients with T315I
mutations were excluded. Like rates of response to dasatinib treatment, the response rates with nilotinib did not
differ significantly between patients with or without
mutations at baseline.63,64 In patients with CML-CP, an
MCyR, a CCyR, and an MMR were achieved by 52 of 87
patients (60%), 35 of 87 patients (40%), and 22 of 76
patients (29%), respectively, who did not have baseline
mutations compared with 49 of 100 patients (49%), 32 of
100 patients (32%), and 19 of 87 patients (22%), respectively, who had baseline mutations (P>.05 for all comparisons) and evaluable samples. However, patients who had
low-sensitivity mutations achieved lower CyR rates (1 of 8
patients [13%], 3 of 7 patients [43%], and 1 of 11
patients [9%] with Y253H, E255V/K, and F359V/C
mutations, respectively, achieved an MCyR; none
achieved a CCyR) and lower molecular response rates
(0 of 7 patients [0%], 1 of 7 patients [14%], and 0 of
10 patients [0%], respectively).
In a study of imatinib-resistant and imatinib-intolerant patients who received either nilotinib or dasatinib as
second-line or third-line therapy, relapse after an initial
response with a new mutation was more common in
patients who had mutations at baseline (23 of 51 patients;
45%) than in patients who had wild-type BCR-ABL at
baseline (8 of 44 patients; 18%).65 Forty-three patients
did not respond or relapsed when they received treatment
with a second-line TKI, including 26 patients who
received third-line therapy. After a median of 4 months of
treatment with third-line therapy, 13 of 20 patients who

BCR-ABL Mutations and TKI Therapy/Jabbour et al

had mutations at baseline relapsed with a newly acquired
mutation after an initial response, whereas 1 of 6 patients
without mutations at baseline relapsed with a newly
acquired mutation. All patients who had baseline mutations and lost responses to second-line or third-line treatments (36 of 36 patients) had newly acquired mutations.
A relapse after an initial response was associated with new
mutations in 45 of 54 patients (83%). With the exception
of T315I, the mutations that conferred resistance to nilotinib or dasatinib were nonoverlapping. The mutations
that conferred resistance specifically to dasatinib were
T315A, V299L, and F317L/I/C/V and those that conferred resistance specifically to nilotinib were Y253H,
E255K/V, L273M, and F359V. In a separate study of
imatinib-intolerant or imatinib-resistant patients who
received dasatinib and nilotinib as second-line and thirdline therapies, 29 of 112 patients (26%) acquired new
mutations, including 24 patients who had evidence of
drug resistance.66 Soverini et al65 observed that the mutations that conferred resistance to nilotinib and dasatinib
did not overlap with the exception of T315I.66 Mutations
at residues 299 and 317 conferred resistance to dasatinib,
whereas mutations at residues 253, 255, 311, and 359
conferred resistance to nilotinib.66
It is important to note that factors other than mutations affect the response to TKI therapy. Studies have
indicated that a proportion of patients who progress do
not have mutations.19,58 In addition, other studies have
demonstrated that patients who have a CCyR can develop
BCR-ABL mutations and maintain their CCyR.67,68
Future Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Therapies
Although the T315I mutation is identified in only a small
proportion of patients with CML-CP, it confers resistance
to all 3 currently approved TKIs and is associated with a
poor prognosis.19,69 However, prognosis is associated
with disease stage at the time of detection, and patients
with this mutation who have an indolent disease course
have been reported.45 New therapies are in development
for patients with the T315I mutation and for other
patients who fail second-line therapies. Therapies currently in development target not only the BCR-ABL pathway but also other kinases and the modulation of cellular
processes, such as apoptosis.
The most clinically mature of these new agents is
bosutinib (SKI606)—an SRC/ABL inhibitor that currently is in clinical trials and has demonstrated efficacy in
patients with CML-CP who failed imatinib and were not
treated with second-generation TKIs (Table 1).70 How-

ever, bosutinib is not active clinically against T315I mutations. A head-to-head, phase 3, randomized trial of
bosutinib versus imatinib in patients with newly diagnosed CML-CP is ongoing. Preliminary results are
expected in late 2010. Another promising third-line agent
is omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OMAPRO; ChemGenex
Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Menlo Park, Calif), a subcutaneously bioavailable form of homoharringtonine. Omacetaxine works independently of BCR-ABL, and it blocks
protein synthesis and induces apoptosis. On the basis of
encouraging efficacy and safety results from a phase 2 trial
of omacetaxine in imatinib-resistant patients in all phases
of CML with the T315I mutation,71 omacetaxine currently is under review by the US Food and Drug Administration for patients with T315 mutations (Table 1).
Other new kinase therapies include AP24534, a
multikinase inhibitor with in vitro and in vivo activity
against wild-type BCR-ABL, and the T315I clone.72
Once-daily oral dosing has proven to be effective in mouse
models,72 and a phase 1 trial in patients with Ph-positive
leukemia is ongoing (Table 1).73,74 Another new class of
agents being tested for the treatment of CML is aurora kinase inhibitors (eg, XL-22875). Aurora kinases regulate
cell division and are overexpressed in leukemic cells.76 Aurora kinase inhibitors also inhibit BCR-ABL, but they
remain active against the T315I mutation, because binding with these agents does not occur as deeply in the
hydrophobic pocket as it does with other TKIs. Thus,
they are not subject to steric hindrance by isoleucine.76
DCC-2036 belongs to a novel class of agents known
as switch pocket inhibitors, which bind to kinases in the
regions that regulate the switch between active and inactive conformation. Therefore, DCC-2036 binding is not
affected by the T315I mutation. The switch pocket structure varies between kinases; thus, inhibitors are kinase specific. In vitro, DCC-2036 inhibited T3151, Y253F, and
M351T with an IC50 <25 nM. Levels of phosphorylated
ABL decreased in mice who were treated with 100 mg/kg
DCC-2036, and daily dosing improved OS.77 DCC2036 currently is in phase 1 clinical trials for patients with
resistant or intolerant CML or ALL.
The Role of Monitoring and Mutation

ELN.3 Both the NCCN and ELN recommend mutation
analysis in instances of inadequate response and suggest
that mutation screening may assist the in choice of a second-generation TKI.3,4 However, neither the NCCN nor
ELN provides clear guidance on altering or selecting therapy based on mutational analysis, and neither discusses
the significance of particular mutations (with the exception of T315I).
A recent report from the Agency for Healthcare
Research and Quality (AHRQ) on the assessment of
BCR-ABL mutations and their utility in predicting
response also should be considered. Thirty-one publications involving BCR-ABL testing (20 with dasatinib, 7
with imatinib, 3 with nilotinib, and 1 with various TKIs)
were reviewed.78 The report concluded that, with the
exception of T315I, the presence of mutations did not
predict clinical outcomes with TKI therapy. Thus, the
value of mutation testing in patient management remains
uncertain, and prospective data from international registries are needed.

Current Treatment Algorithm for Patients
With Newly Diagnosed Chronic Myeloid
Leukemia in Chronic Phase
Imatinib 400 mg daily is the recommended frontline
treatment for patients with CML (Fig. 2). The efficacy of
nilotinib and dasatinib was superior to that of imatinib in
2 independent phase 3 randomized trials.29,36 These
drugs currently are under review by health authorities for
the frontline indication. Bosutinib is also being evaluated
in randomized trials for patients with newly diagnosed
CML, and the results are expected in 2010. The results
from these studies may affect the current treatment paradigm for patients with newly diagnosed CML. Nilotinib,
dasatinib, or bosutinib may become frontline treatments
of choice, and patients may continue indefinitely if they
achieve an optimal response, may switch to an alternative
TKI if they are intolerant or resistant (except for those
with the T315I mutation), or may consider hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or clinical trials if it is
determined that they have the T315I mutation.

BCR-ABL Mutations and TKI Therapy/Jabbour et al

Figure 2. This chart illustrates the suggested treatment algorithm for patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia
(CML) in chronic phase. An asterisk indicates that imatinib and nilotinib are the only approved tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs)
for the frontline treatment of CML. Nilotinib recently was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration after it demonstrated superior response rates and a significant improvement in the time to progression compared with imatinib36; those
improvements persisted at a median follow-up >18 months in an international, phase 3, randomized trial.40,41 Dasatinib also demonstrated superior response rates compared with imatinib in a phase 3 randomized trial and is under review for regulatory approval in several countries.29 Bosutinib is being evaluated in a randomized trial of patients with newly diagnosed CML, and those
results are expected in 2010. The dagger indicates that randomized clinical trials currently are underway to examine the value of
an early switch to second-generation TKIs in patients who have a suboptimal response to imatinib. CyR indicates cytogenetic
response; PCyR, partial cytogenetic response; MMR, major molecular response; F317L, phenylalanine to leucine mutation at codon
317; V299L, valine to leucine mutation at codon 299; E255K/V, glutamic acid to lysine or valine mutation at codon 255; Y253H, tyrosine to histidine mutation at codon 253; F359C/V, phenylalanine to cysteine or valine mutation at codon 359; HSCT, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

It has not been demonstrated that the presence of
baseline mutations can predict the outcome of treatment
with imatinib; thus, baseline mutation testing is not necessary. In the event of treatment failure on imatinib, an
alternative approach is required. Dose escalation of
imatinib can be considered, but it is not likely to be effective in patients who never achieved a hematologic or cytogenetic response with imatinib or in those with known
imatinib-resistant mutations. A change to a second-generation therapy may be a better option for most patients. In
vitro and in vivo data have demonstrated that both dasatinib and nilotinib have a small and distinct set of mutants
that confer decreased sensitivity: Y253H, E255K/V, and
F359C/V for nilotinib63 and V299L and F317L for dasa-

tinib.61 If it is known that patients have 1 of these mutations, then they should be considered for treatment with
the agent that retains activity against their particular
mutation.
Most patients, however, do not have these mutations.79 For this reason, the AHRQ concluded that the
presence of BCR-ABL mutations does not predict the
response to TKI therapy.78 Although it is clear that a few
mutations, in fact, are associated with inferior responses
to TKIs, treatment for most patients should be guided by
previous medical history and by the safety profiles of the
drugs. Severe, uncontrolled diabetes and past pancreatitis
are considered risk factors for nilotinib use because of the
occurrence of grade 3/4 elevated lipase levels (18%),

1807

Review Article

elevated bilirubin levels (7%), and hyperglycemia (12%)
in some patients who receive second-line nilotinib,31
although most biochemical laboratory abnormalities associated with nilotinib were transient, asymptomatic, and
not clinically relevant. Caution should be exercised before
prescribing dasatinib for patients with hypertension,
asthma, pneumonia, gastrointestinal bleeding, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, chest wall injury, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disorders, and concomitant aspirin use because of the risk of pleural and
pericardial effusion,80,81 bleeding,81-83 and infection84
associated with this TKI. Patients with the T315I mutation are insensitive to both nilotinib and dasatinib in
vitro,85 and a clinical trial or HSCT can be considered for
such patients.3,4,86
The impact of mutations on clinical response is
under investigation. The treatment algorithm should be
modified accordingly as new data become available.
Recent reports indicate that baseline characteristics at the
time second-generation therapy is initiated may predict
response. The ultimate goal is the development of a scoring system to predict patient prognosis based on multiple
factors, which will allow a more accurate prediction of the
response to therapy. These scoring systems include 1 or
more of the following: Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance score, previous cytogenetic response
to imatinib, baseline mutations with low sensitivity to a
particular TKI, hemoglobin concentration, basophilia,
Sokal score, and recurrent neutropenia.87-89 Such scoring
systems may guide future treatment algorithms by predicting the response to particular TKIs.
In conclusion, given the incomplete data and the
presence of other mechanisms of TKI resistance, in vitro
IC50 data alone are not sufficient to guide the choice of
TKI in the presence of a mutant BCR-ABL clone. For
example, whereas in vitro data indicate that dasatinib is
more potent that nilotinib,90 it has been demonstrated in
vivo that nilotinib delivers higher concentrations to CML
cells.52 Clinically, both second-line therapies are effective
against most mutations that cause resistance to imatinib,
but each remains relatively ineffective against certain
mutations. In vivo data indicate that, for each second-generation TKI, the presence of a subset of mutations at the
time resistance is detected may be helpful in the selection
of the appropriate second-line therapy. Fewer BCR-ABL
mutations are associated with decreased sensitivity to nilotinib and dasatinib than to imatinib, possibly because of
the improved binding properties of these drugs to the
BCR-ABL target. In patients who have the T315I muta-

1808

tion, HSCT or participation in a clinical trial with 1 of
the newer agents that have demonstrated activity against
this mutant can be considered. We are only beginning to
understand the utility of mutation testing in monitoring
the response to TKIs or in guiding treatment choices.
Clinical trial data from an evaluation of the response of
specific clones to TKIs will be essential to further refine
the role of mutation testing in patient therapy. Thus, as
our understanding of predictors of response to imatinib
and second-generation TKIs increases, the development
of a scoring system to predict patient response may be possible. Patient comorbidities and TKI safety profiles always
must be considered when choosing a TKI therapy. Furthermore, the current treatment algorithm for CML is
likely to be revised as more data become available about
second-generation TKIs in the frontline setting.
