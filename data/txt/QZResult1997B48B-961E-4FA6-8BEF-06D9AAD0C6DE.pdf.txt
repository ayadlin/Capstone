ABSTRACT
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC) is the most frequent malignant salivary
gland cancer. Response to chemoradiotherapy is modest, and therefore radical
surgery remains the standard-of-care. Emerging evidence suggests that Interleukin
(IL)-6 signaling correlates with the survival of cancer stem cells and resistance
to therapy. Here, we investigated whether inhibition of IL-6 receptor (IL-6R)
signaling with tocilizumab (humanized anti-human IL-6R antibody) sensitizes MEC
to chemotherapy using human mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines (UM-HMC) and
correspondent xenograft models. In vitro, we observed that tocilizumab inhibited
STAT3 phosphorylation but had no measurable effect in MEC cell viability (UM-HMC1,-3A,-3B). In contrast, the anti-tumor effect of single agent tocilizumab on MEC
xenografts was comparable to paclitaxel or cisplatin. Combination of tocilizumab with
cisplatin or paclitaxel enhanced the inhibitory effect of chemotherapy on xenograft
growth (P < 0.05), time to failure (P < 0.01), decreased vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) expression and tumor microvessel density (P < 0.05) without added
systemic toxicities. Notably, tocilizumab decreased the fraction of MEC cancer
stem cells (ALDHhighCD44high) in vitro, and prevented paclitaxel-induced increase
in the fraction of cancer stem cells in vivo (P < 0.05). Collectively, these findings
demonstrate that tocilizumab enhances the anti-tumor effect of conventional
chemotherapy in preclinical models of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and suggest that
patients might benefit from combination therapy with an inhibitor of IL-6R signaling
and chemotherapeutic agent such as paclitaxel.

INTRODUCTION

cancer, histologically characterized as a glandular
epithelial neoplasm containing mucous, intermediate,
and epidermoid cells [4-6]. Histological grading
correlates well with clinical behavior. As such, the
5-year survival for low or intermediate grade tumors is
85-98%, while for high grade tumors is only 22-55%

Salivary gland cancers are complex and diverse
malignancies comprised of 24 morphologically
different neoplasms [1-4]. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma

[6-11]. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are characterized
by relentless growth and resistance to systemic therapy
and radiotherapy. Therefore, the most effective therapy
remains radical surgery, which is typically accompanied
by severe facial disfigurement, loss of function, and major
consequences to the quality of life of patients [5, 1216]. The development of a mechanism-based therapeutic
strategy that sensitizes these tumors to chemotherapy can
potentially enhance the survival and quality of life of
patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
Interleukin-6 (IL-6) enhances the survival of cancer
stem cells (CSC) in several tumors including glioma
and breast cancer [17, 18], and increases the conversion
of non-cancer stem cells into cancer stem cells in breast
cancer models [19]. Downstream mediators of IL-6
signaling (e.g. JAK/STAT3, PI3K, NF-κB) strongly
correlate with the pathobiology of several malignancies
[20-25]. In head and neck cancer, serum IL-6 levels
correlate with poor prognosis [26, 27]. We have recently
showed that cancer stem cells reside in the perivascular
niche of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [28],
and that endothelial cell-secreted IL-6 enhances the
survival, self-renewal, and tumorigenic potential of cancer
stem cells [29]. We also observed that cisplatin treatment
enhances the fraction of cancer stem cells in head and
neck tumors [30]. We have recently observed that salivary
mucoepidermoid carcinomas contain a sub-population
of uniquely tumorigenic cancer stem cells, defined as
ALDHhighCD44high cells. It is believed that cancer stem
cells play a critical role in resistance to therapy in many
glandular malignancies. However, it is unclear if IL-6
signaling is involved in the survival of cancer stem cells
and the resistance to chemotherapy observed in patients
with mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
Progress in the development of effective therapies
for mucoepidermoid carcinoma has been hindered by
the lack of experimental models. However, the recent
characterization of mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines
and accompanying xenograft models generated from
patients with resistant disease [28] has finally enabled
mechanistic studies and the testing of new therapies.
Here, we evaluated the anti-tumor effect of tocilizumab,
a humanized anti-human IL-6R antibody, in combination
with conventional chemotherapy (cisplatin or paclitaxel)
in preclinical models of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
We observed that therapeutic inhibition of IL-6R with
tocilizumab enhanced the in vivo anti-tumor effect
of both conventional chemotherapeutic agents tested
here, despite having no direct effect on the survival
of unsorted mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells in vitro.
Notably, tocilizumab treatment caused a decrease in the
microvessel density of xenograft tumors, and prevented
paclitaxel-induced increase in the fraction of cancer stem
cells. Collectively, these data demonstrate that therapeutic
inhibition of IL-6R signaling with tocilizumab potentiates
the anti-tumor effect of conventional chemotherapeutic

drugs in preclinical models of mucoepidermoid carcinoma,
and suggests that patients might benefit from the combined
administration of tocilizumab and paclitaxel.

RESULTS
Expression of key mediators of IL-6 signaling in
mucoepidermoid carcinoma
To begin to understand the therapeutic potential of
targeting IL-6 signaling in mucoepidermoid carcinomas,
we evaluated the expression of key components of the IL-6
pathway in primary human tumors and in our xenograft
models (Supplementary Figure S1). We observed that
the xenograft tumors generated with UM-HMC cell lines
reproduced the typical morphology of primary human
tumors, with areas of predominantly cystic, while other
areas with more of a solid appearance (Supplementary
Figure S1A). Immunofluorescence staining revealed that
the IL-6 ligand, both receptors (i.e. IL-6R, gp130) and the
key downstream effector pSTAT3 are highly expressed
in these tumors (Supplementary Figure S1B and S1C).
Notably, both human and xenograft tumors showed
largely similar patterns of expression of these molecules
(Supplementary Figure S1C). These descriptive results
suggested that IL-6 could potentially play a significant
role in the pathobiology of mucoepidermoid carcinoma,
and encouraged us to perform developmental therapeutic
studies with tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6R
antibody that has been approved by the FDA for treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis since 2010.

In pilot experiments, we observed that single agent
tocilizumab inhibited tumor growth to the same extent
as single agent paclitaxel or cisplatin (Supplementary
Figure S2A and S2C). While tocilizumab was well
tolerated without causing a noticeable decrease in mouse
weight, we observed a 10% weight loss in mice that
received 20 mg/kg paclitaxel (Supplementary Figure
S2A). Notably, the combination of tocilizumab with
paclitaxel or cisplatin potentiated the overall effect of
therapy leading to a tumoristatic effect without added
toxicities (Supplementary Figure S2). The results of this
pilot experiment suggested that IL-6R inhibition with
tocilizumab have a therapeutic effect in preclinical models
of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and informed our decision
to decrease the dose of paclitaxel to 15 mg/kg for the
remaining studies.
When we repeated these experiments using a larger
sample size (n = 8-10), the overall trends were similar
to those observed in the pilot experiment (Figure 1). We

observed that tocilizumab with paclitaxel or cisplatin
group had a significant effect on tumor volume compared
with control group (Figure 1A and 2A, P < 0.05), and
single agent tocilizumab showed significant tumor growth
inhibition, similar to single agent paclitaxel (Figure 1A
and 1C-1E) or cisplatin (Figure 2A, 2C and 2D), without
noticeable systemic toxicities (Figure 1B and 2B). Western
blots of the tumor tissues retrieved from the mice at the
end of the experiments revealed that tocilizumab, but
not paclitaxel, inhibited the main downstream effector of
IL-6 signaling, i.e. phosphorylated STAT3 (Figure 1F).
Interestingly, tocilizumab and/or paclitaxel inhibited the
AKT signaling pathway, a key regulator of tumor cell
survival (Figure 1F). Kaplan-Meier analyses using as
criterion for “event” a 2-fold increase in tumor volume
as compared to pre-treatment size, showed significant
tumor inhibition for single agent Tocilizumab (P < 0.01),
when compared to vehicle control (Figure 1C). Notably,
we observed even more marked tumor inhibition when
tocilizumab was used in combination with paclitaxel

(Figure 1C) or cisplatin (Figure 2C), when compared
to controls (P < 0.01). Calculation of tumor growth
inhibition (TGI) index confirmed previous results,
demonstrating an overall anti-tumor effect for Tocilizumab
that was comparable with single agent conventional
chemotherapy, and a significant potentiation of this effect
when the targeted drug was combined with Paclitaxel
(Supplementary Figure S3).

Tocilizumab is not cytotoxic to mucoepidermoid
carcinoma cells in vitro
To understand potential mechanisms underlying the
in vivo anti-tumor effect of tocilizumab, we performed a
series of in vitro experiments. Cell viability assays using
a panel of mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell lines (UMHMC-1,-3A,-3B) and primary human endothelial cells
(HDMEC) revealed that the overall IC50 for cisplatin
ranged between 0.99-1.75 μmol/L, while the IC50 for

of tocilizumab with paclitaxel group was used in vivo
(Figure 4C), providing a putative mechanism for the antiangiogenic effect of tocilizumab described above. We
have shown that endothelial cells secrete IL-6, CXCL8,
and EGF that induce phosphorylation of STAT3, AKT,
and ERK in tumor cells, and that these phosphorylation
events enhance tumor cell survival and migration [3133]. We have recently demonstrated that endothelial
cell-secreted IL-6 regulates the rate of tumor growth via
STAT3 signaling [34]. Considering the inhibitory effect
of tocilizumab on constitutively active STAT3 in UMHMC-1 cells (Figure 4D) and on IL-6-induced pSTAT3
in UM-HMC-3B (Figure 4E), we performed a series of
experiments using endothelial cell conditioned medium
as a source of IL-6 in an attempt to mimic endothelial
cell-cancer cell interactions observed in the perivascular
area [31-34]. We observed a potent induction of STAT3
phosphorylation upon exposure of mucoepidermoid
carcinoma cells (UM-HMC-3A,-3B) to endothelialconditioned medium, which was partially blocked in a
dose-dependent manner with increasing concentrations of
tocilizumab (Figure 4F and 4G). We concluded from these
experiments that tocilizumab interferes with the crosstalk
between endothelial cells and mucoepidermoid carcinoma
cells, with a net anti-angiogenic effect that can explain,
at least in part, the overall anti-tumor effect of this drug.

paclitaxel was 24 nmol/L in endothelial cells and 0.75 to
2.89 nmol/L in UM-HMC cell lines (Figure 3A-3D). In
contrast, Tocilizumab had no measurable cytotoxic effect
in the panel of cells evaluated here (Figure 3A-3D). We
also investigated the effect of combination therapy with
cisplatin or paclitaxel and observed that tocilizumab does
not have a significant impact in cell density (Figure 3E)
or cell cycle (Figure 3F). We repeated these experiments
with the other 2 UM-HMC cell lines and with endothelial
cells, and observed similar results (data not shown).
Collectively, these experiments indicated that tocilizumab
does not have a direct effect on the survival of human
mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells.

Tocilizumab decreases tumor microvessel density
As we were analyzing histologically the xenograft
tumors, we observed that perhaps therapeutic inhibition of
IL-6R signaling with tocilizumab had an anti-angiogenic
effect in vivo despite the lack of a direct cytotoxic effect to
endothelial cells in vitro. Indeed, we observed a decrease
(P < 0.01) in tumor microvessel density when tocilizumab
was used alone or in combination with paclitaxel
(Figure 4A and 4B). Furthermore, VEGF expression was
decreased when single agent tocilizumab or combination

expression (ALDHhighCD44high). To understand the effect
of tocilizumab in mucoepidermoid carcinoma stem cells
in vitro, we performed sphere assays as we described [35].
While paclitaxel and cisplatin mediated dose-dependent
decreases in the number of salispheres generated with
unsorted UM-HMC-3B cells (Figure 5A), tocilizumab
did not show a measurable effect (Figure 5B). Drug
combinations with tocilizumab and paclitaxel or cisplatin
followed similar trends of single drug experiments without
any noticeable effect for tocilizumab in both, unsorted
cells (Figure 5C) or UM-HMC-3B cells FACS-sorted for
ALDH and CD44 (Figure 5D). As expected, the number
of spheres formed by untreated ALDHhighCD44high cells
was higher than by ALDHlowCD44low cells (Figure 5D).
Collectively, these studies revealed an inhibitory effect for

paclitaxel and for cisplatin, and lack of measurable effect
for tocilizumab, in cancer stem cells using the in vitro
sphere assay in ultra-low attachment plates (Figure 5E).
To investigate the effect of tocilizumab on
putative cancer stem cells in vivo, we performed
immunofluorescence staining for ALDH1 and CD44 in
mucoepidermoid carcinoma xenografts (Figure 6A). As
expected, ALDH1 staining was localized in the cytoplasm
and was limited to a small sub-set of cells, while CD44
was localized in the cell membrane and presented a more
generalized staining pattern (Figure 6A). Interestingly, the
fraction of ALDH-positive cells was significantly higher
(P < 0.05) in the tumor invasive fronts, as compared to
the central areas (Figure 6A and 6B). To quantify the
effect of therapy on the fraction of cancer stem cells in

vivo, we digested the xenograft tumors, generated singlecell suspensions, stained them for ALDH activity and
CD44 expression, and sorted ALDHhighCD44high cells
by flow cytometry. Therapy with tocilizumab by itself
showed mixed results. In one experiment it did not have a
significant effect on the fraction of ALDHhighCD44high cells
(Figure 6C), while in the other experiment it decreased
the fraction of cancer stem cells (Figure 6D). Paclitaxel
treatment mediated a significant increase (P < 0.01) in the
fraction of ALDHhighCD44high cells (Figure 6C). However,
adding tocilizumab to the treatment with paclitaxel
mediated a return of the fraction of ALDHhighCD44high
cells to baseline levels (Figure 6C). Cisplatin treatment
did not cause a significant increase in the fraction of
ALDHhighCD44high cells, and its combination with
tocilizumab had no measurable consequences (Figure 6D).
We conclude from this set of experiments that the majority
of the tumorigenic cancer stem cells are in the invasive
fronts of xenograft mucoepidermoid carcinomas, and that
tocilizumab inhibits paclitaxel-induced enrichment of the
fraction of these cancer stem cells.
To further understand the effect of tocilizumab
in the cancer stem cell fraction, we performed in vitro
experiments with UM-HMC-3B cells treated with
tocilizumab or with Stattic, a small molecule inhibitor
of STAT3. Tocilizumab treatment resulted in a dosedependent reduction in the fraction of cancer stem cells
(Figure 6E). Interestingly, direct inhibition of STAT3
with Stattic also decreased the fraction of cancer stem
cells (Figure 6E). These effects were not simply due to
differential expression of pro-survival proteins of the Bcl2 family in cancer stem cells, as compared to control cells
(Figure 6F). Rather, the tocilizumab-mediated decrease
in the fraction of cancer stem cells might be attributable
to the differential expression of the receptor IL-6R,
which is strongly expressed in ALDHhighCD44high cells
when compared to ALDHlowCD44low cells (Figure 6G).
Interestingly, the expression of gp130, total and phosphoSTAT3 was similar in both cancer stem cells and non-stem
cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the effect
of tocilizumab in the cancer stem cell fraction correlates
with the increased expression of its target receptor (IL-6R)
in mucoepidermoid carcinoma stem cells.

endothelial cell-secreted IL-6 regulates tumor growth
[34] and the tumorigenic potential of cancer stem cells
in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas [29]. We
have also observed that mucoepidermoid carcinomas
contain a population of uniquely tumorigenic cancer stem
cells. However, we do not know the effect of inhibition
of IL-6 signaling in mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Here,
we showed that therapeutic inhibition of IL-6R with
tocilizumab has no measurable effect on mucoepidermoid
carcinoma cell viability, cell cycle, or sphere formation
in vitro. Surprisingly, the in vivo studies showed very
different results. Tocilizumab has a significant anti-tumor
effect in xenograft mucoepidermoid carcinomas that
correlated with potent inhibition of STAT3 signaling and
inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Single agent tocilizumab
effect was similar to single agent paclitaxel or cisplatin,
but tocilizumab was very much better tolerated by the
mice. Tocilizumab further potentiated the anti-tumor
effect of paclitaxel, and prevented paclitaxel-induced
enrichment of cancer stem cells, without added toxicities.
These results were correlated with a decrease in the
cancer stem cell (ALDHhighCD44high) fraction mediated by
Tocilizumab in vitro, and with the observation the cancer
stem cells express higher levels of IL-6R when compared
to control cells. Collectively, these data unveiled IL-6 as
a therapeutic target for salivary gland mucoepidermoid
carcinomas.
Patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma are treated
with surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy with taxanes
or platinum-based drugs [5, 12-14, 41]. Treatment with
these drugs is typically accompanied by severe systemic
toxicities. Here, we observed that tocilizumab alone had
similar anti-tumor effects when compared with paclitaxel
or cisplatin. Notably, tocilizumab has been FDA-approved
since 2010 for rheumatoid arthritis with an excellent
record of safety for patients. The results of this preclinical
study support the concept that tocilizumab could serve as
a low-toxicity alternative to conventional chemotherapy
in selected patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma. We
went a step forward, and performed drug combination
studies that revealed that tocilizumab enhanced the antitumor effect of conventional chemotherapy, particularly
paclitaxel. Indeed, we observed a significant improvement
in time to failure when tocilizumab was used together
with paclitaxel, when compared to monotherapy or
vehicle controls. Notably, paclitaxel by itself enriched the
fraction of the highly tumorigenic cancer stem cells, as
it has been also demonstrated for other chemotherapeutic
agents in head and neck cancer [30]. In contrast, addition
of tocilizumab to the treatment with paclitaxel brought
the fraction of cancer stem cells down to baseline levels.
These results further suggest that the proposed combined
therapy might be beneficial to patients. Nevertheless,
additional studies are necessary to understand the longterm benefits of cancer stem cell ablation in preclinical
models of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

DISCUSSION
IL-6 plays a major role in the pathobiology of cancer.
It is a key regulator of tumor cell proliferation, invasion
and survival; it regulates the crosstalk between tumor cells
and inflammatory cells, as well as vascular endothelial
cells; and it enhances the survival and plasticity of cancer
stem cells [17-25]. Such findings provided the rationale for
clinical trials using targeted inhibitors of IL-6 in patients
with cancer (e.g. ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, renal
cell carcinoma, prostate cancer) that showed promising
results [24, 36-40]. We have recently demonstrated that

We observed in several studies that tocilizumab is
effective in vivo while has essentially no effect whatsoever
in vitro. We speculate that this is due to its effect on
angiogenesis and inflammation [42, 43], as well as its
putative effect disrupting interactions between endothelial
cells and cancer stem cells within the perivascular
niches. There are several possible explanations for these
intriguing results: A) We showed that endothelial cellderived IL-6 is critical for tumor growth [30]. Considering
the well-known anti-angiogenic effect of IL-6 inhibition
[20], and our own results demonstrating that tocilizumab
inhibited tumor angiogenesis, it is possible that the antitumor effect of tocilizumab is mediated, at least in part,
by decreased supply of oxygen and nutrients to tumor
cells. B) By disrupting perivascular niches, i.e. the site
where cancer stem cells typically reside in carcinomas
[28], tocilizumab may disrupt this crosstalk between
endothelial cells and cancer stem cells. We have recently
showed that endothelial cell-secreted IL-6 enhances the
tumorigenic potential of cancer stem cells [29]. Therefore,
part of the effect observed here with tocilizumab might be
mediated by interfering in this important crosstalk within
the perivascular niche in vivo. And C) Tocilizumab is a
potent inhibitor of STAT3 phosphorylation in vivo (Figure
1F). Considering the critical role of STAT3 signaling in
cancer (e.g. regulation of VEGF expression and tumor
angiogenesis, regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines),
it is possible that the effect of tocilizumab in vivo is
mediated indirectly via blockade of downstream events
induced by STAT3 signaling [44-47]. Such processes are
not observable in vitro, and suggest that a true appreciation
of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic potential of
tocilizumab require in vivo studies, at least in models of
mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
IL-6 is clearly not the only endothelial cellderived factor that could potentially affect the behavior
of mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells. Indeed, we have
shown that endothelial cell-derived CXCL8 and EGF
have significant effects on the survival and motility of
head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells [32, 33].
Here, we used endothelial cell conditioned medium
as a physiological strategy to induce activation of
major signaling pathways (i.e. STAT3, Akt, ERK) in
mucoepidermoid carcinoma cells, to enable the study
of potential effects of tocilizumab in these pathways.
Surprisingly, despite the numerous cytokines/chemokines
present in the endothelial cell conditioned medium,
blockade of IL-6R signalling with Tocilizumab was
sufficient to inhibit STAT3 phosphorylation below baseline
levels (Figure 4F and 4G). Considering the prominent role
of STAT3 signalling in the biology of cancer cells, these
results provide further support to the therapeutic potential
of IL-6R inhibition with tocilizumab in mucoepidermoid
carcinoma.
In summary, patients with mucoepidermoid
carcinoma have very few therapeutic options today, and
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

most of them include radical surgical resection because
these tumors simply do not respond to conventional
chemotherapy [5, 12-16]. Here, we used recently
characterized models of mucoepidermoid carcinoma and
observed that single agent tocilizumab has similar antitumor effects as conventional chemotherapy, without
significant systemic toxicities. Further, we observed that
combination of tocilizumab with paclitaxel enhanced
the anti-tumor effect without added toxicities, and
prevented paclitaxel-induced accumulation of cancer
stem cells. These results demonstrate the anti-tumor
effect of tocilizumab, and suggest that patients with
mucoepidermoid carcinoma might benefit from the
targeted inhibition of IL-6R signaling.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cells and reagents
We used the University of Michigan-Human
Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma cells (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B),
a panel of cell lines recently generated and characterized
by our laboratory [48]. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM; Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum
(FBS; Invitrogen), 1% 200 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen),
20 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF; Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO, USA), 400 ng/mL hydrocortisone (SigmaAldrich), 5 μg/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1%
penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37°C with 5% CO2.
Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells
(HDMEC; Lonza, Walkersville, MD, USA) were cultured
in endothelial cell growth medium-2 for microvascular
cells (EGM2-MV; Lonza). The experimental drugs used
here were a humanized anti-IL-6R antibody (Tocilizumab;
Genentech, San Francisco, CA, USA), control IgG
(Jackson Laboratories, West Grove, PA, USA), cisplatin
(Acros organics, Fairlawn, NJ, USA), and paclitaxel
(Sagent pharmaceuticals, Schaumburg, IL, USA).

Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay
SRB assays were performed to evaluate the effect of
compounds on mucoepidermoid carcinoma cell viability,
as described [49]. MEC cells (UM-HMC-1,-3A,-3B)
were seeded at a density of 2×103 cells per well in 96-well
plates, allowed to adhere overnight, and treated with drugs
(or controls) for 72 hours. Plates were read in a microplate
reader at 560 nm (GENios; Tecan, Granz, Austria). Data
were obtained from triplicate wells per condition and are
representative of at least 3 independent experiments.

Aldrich), 20 ng/ml EGF (Sigma-Aldrich), 20 ng/mL basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Sigma-Aldrich), 10 μg/ml
insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% penicillin/streptomycin
(Invitrogen).

UM-HMC cell lines were plated, serum starved
overnight, treated with tocilizumab or Stattic (STAT3
inhibitor V, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA, USA) at the
indicated concentrations, and exposed to 20 ng/ml rhIL6 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). NP-40 lysis
buffer was used to prepare whole cell lysates that were
resolved using PAGE. Membranes were incubated with
the following primary antibodies for 1 hour at room
temperature or overnight at 4°C: mouse anti-human
phospho-STAT3, rabbit anti-human STAT3, rabbit antihuman phospho-ERK1/2, rabbit anti-human ERK1/2,
rabbit anti-human phospho-AKT, rabbit anti-human AKT,
rabbit anti-human Bcl-xL, rabbit anti-human gp130 (Cell
Signaling, Beverly, MA, USA), rabbit anti-human IL6Rα, rabbit anti-human VEGF (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Santa Cruz, CA, USA), hamster anti-human Bcl-2 (BD
Pharmingen, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA); or mouse antiGAPDH (Chemicon, Billerica, MA, USA).

SCID mouse model of human tumor angiogenesis
Porous poly-L-lactic acid scaffolds (6×6×1 mm)
with an average pore diameter of 180 μm were fabricated,
as we described [51]. Just before transplantation, scaffolds
were seeded with 7×105 HDMEC and 3×105 UM-HMC3B cells in a 1:1 Matrigel/EGM2-MV mix. Female
severe combined immunodeficient mice (CB.17.SCID;
Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington, MA, USA) were
anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine, and two bilateral
scaffolds were transplanted in the subcutaneous space
of the dorsal region of each mouse. When the average
tumor volume reached 200 mm3, mice were randomized
into the following treatment conditions: 5 mg/kg IgG
control, 5 mg/kg tocilizumab, 5 mg/kg cisplatin and/or 15
mg/kg paclitaxel administered weekly via intraperitoneal
injection. When 2 drugs were combined (e.g. tocilizumab
+ paclitaxel), they were administered with a 12-hour
interval between them. Tumors were surgically retrieved
when they reached 1,000 mm3, fixed overnight in 10%
buffered formalin (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA, USA)
at 4°C, and processed for immunohistochemistry. Tumor
size was calculated using the formula: volume (mm3) = L
× W2/2 (L, length; W, width). The care and treatment of
experimental animals was in accordance with University
of Michigan institutional guidelines.

Flow cytometry
Cancer stem cells were identified as
ALDHhighCD44high cells, as we described [28-30]. Singlecell suspensions were obtained from the digestion of
xenograft tumors or from the UM-HMC-3B cell line.
Cells were counted, resuspended at 2×106 cells/ml PBS,
and incubated with activated Aldefluor® substrate (BAA)
or the ALDH inhibitor (DEAB) for 45 minutes at 37°C,
using the Aldefluor® kit (StemCell; Vancouver, BC,
Canada). Cells were exposed to anti-CD44 antibody
(APC-Cat #559942, PE-Cat #550989) for 30 minutes at
40C. Anti-HLA-ABC (PE-Cat #560168; BD Pharmingen)
was used to separate human cells from mouse cells, and
7-AAD (Cat #00-6993-50; eBiosciences, San Diego,
CA, USA) staining was used to exclude dying cells. To
measure the effect of drugs on cell cycle, UM-HMC-3B
cells were treated with tocilizumab, cisplatin, paclitaxel,
or controls diluted in cultured medium. After 24 hours,
cells were retrieved, exposed to a hypotonic solution of
propidium iodide containing 0.1% sodium citrate, 25
μg/ml propidium iodide, 100 μg/ml RNase A, and 0.1%
Triton X-100. Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow
cytometry, as described [50].

Immunofluorescence and Immunohistochemistry
Tissue sections were incubated at 60°C for 20
minutes, deparafinized in xylene twice for 10 minutes,
washed with 100% ethanol twice for 5 minutes, and
then rehydrated with graded ethanol. Antigen retrieval
was performed with Target Retrieval Solution (Dako,
Carpinteria, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s
instructions, and the slides were washed with PBS
thrice at room temperature. Endogenous peroxidase
activity was quenched by 10-minute incubation in 3%
hydrogen peroxide in PBS. Primary antibodies against
ALDH1 (Abcam, Cambridge, England), IL-6 (Abcam),
IL-6R (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), gp130 (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), CD44 (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL,
USA), and pSTAT3 (Cell Signaling) were prelabeled with
Alexafluor 488 or 594 using a Zenon labeling kit, and
Prolong Gold Anti-fade Reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen)
was used to mount the slides. Immunofluorescence
images were taken with a Nikon Eclipse 80i fluorescence
microscope, and image processing was done with
Q-Capture Pro 7 (Q-imaging) and NIH ImageJ.
Alternatively, tissue sections were incubated in Target

Salisphere assay
Non-adherent spheroids of mucoepidermoid
carcinoma cells (named salispheres) were generated in
ultra-low attachment 96-well plates (Corning; Corning,
NY, USA) for 5 days with DMEM-F12 (Invitrogen)
supplemented with 1% N2 supplement (Invitrogen), 1%
GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), 1 μM dexamethasone (Sigmawww.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Statistical analysis was performed using Welch’s
t-test, Kruskal-Wallis tests, or one-way ANOVA followed
by appropriate post-hoc tests. Kaplan-Meier curves were
analyzed with the Gehan’s generalized Wilcoxon tests.
Tumor regression was analyzed using a linear mixed
model regression to analyze the repeated measurements
on each tumor. Model fixed effects included time,
tocilizumab, chemotherapy, and the interaction of
treatments and time. Model random effects included both
mouse and tumor position. For all models a continuous
autoregressive correlation structure was used, which
assumes more correlated variances among temporally
proximate observations. A log-transformation of the
outcome variable (tumor volume) was used because the
tumor volumes follow an exponential increase. Size at
study initiation was also controlled for. Analysis was
performed using the “nlme” package in the statistical
