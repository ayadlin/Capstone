BACKGROUND: The AKT inhibitor MK-2206 at a dose of 60 mg every other day was evaluated in gastric/gastroesophageal junction
cancers. METHODS: Patients who had progressed after first-line treatment were eligible. Pertinent eligibility criteria included
adequate organ function, a fasting serum glucose level  150 mg/dL, and less than grade 2 malabsorption or chronic diarrhea. MK2206 was given orally (60 evaluable patients required). The primary endpoint was overall survival, and a median survival of 6.5
months (power, 89%; significance level, 0.07) was considered encouraging for further investigation. RESULTS: Seventy patients were
included in the final analyses. The median age was 59.8 years (range, 30.4-86.7 years); 70% were male, 89% were white, and 7% were
Asian. There were 2 deaths possibly related to the study drug (cardiac arrest and respiratory failure). Grade 4 adverse events included
hyperglycemia, anemia, and lung infection (1 each). Grade 3 adverse events occurred in < 5% of patients except for fatigue (6%).
Other adverse events (all grades) included anemia (17%), anorexia (30%), diarrhea (26%), fatigue (50%), hyperglycemia (30%), nausea (40%), vomiting (22%), dry skin (19%), maculopapular rash (30%), and acneiform rash (13%). The response rate was 1%, the median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95% confidence interval, 1.7-1.8 months), and the median overall survival was 5.1
months (95% confidence interval, 3.7-9.4 months) CONCLUSIONS: MK-2206 as second-line therapy was well tolerated by an unselected group of patients with gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancers, but it did not have sufficient activity (response rate, 1%;

INTRODUCTION
Gastric cancer is a common cause of cancer deaths worldwide and results in approximately 800,000 deaths per year.1 Early
diagnosis is uncommon, and many patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. The median survival of
patients with advanced unresectable gastric cancer is in the range of 7 to 9 months.2 A number of combination chemotherapy regimens are used with wide regional and country-specific variations, and there is no general consensus regarding the
optimal first-line chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ)
adenocarcinomas. Docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (DCF) constitute a Food and Drug Administration–approved
regimen in the United States because of the improved clinical benefit in comparison with cisplatin and fluorouracil. However, DCF is associated with significant toxicity, with grade 3/4 neutropenia seen in 82% of patients and febrile neutropenia seen in 29%.3 Combination chemotherapy regimens such as DCF and epirubicin, cisplatin, and infusional 5fluorouracil require central venous access and an ambulatory infusion pump; this adds to the complexity of care and
potentially increases the risk of infection and thrombosis.3 Despite the development of new regimens substituting

capecitabine for 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin for cisplatin (ie, epirubicin, cisplatin, and capecitabine; epirubicin,
oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil; and epirubicin, oxaliplatin,
and capecitabine), the outcomes of patients with advanced
gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas have shown only modest improvement in the last decade, and median survival is
still less than 12 months.3,4 Recent targeting of Her2/neu,
which is overexpressed in 10% to 25% of cases, was shown
to be effective in gastric cancer. The addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy (cisplatin plus 5-fluorouracil) was
explored in a phase 3 randomized trial of Her2/neu-positive gastric cancer patients (n 5 594), and it significantly
improved overall survival (OS) in comparison with chemotherapy alone (13.8 vs 11.1 months, P 5 .0046); it is a
standard-of-care regimen for these patients.5 However,
other targeted agents, such as epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors (cetuximab and panitumumab) and
antiangiogenic inhibitors (bevacizumab), have failed to
improve survival when they have been combined with
chemotherapy.6-8
A number of other biomarkers are being evaluated
for targeted therapy in gastric and GEJ cancers. The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) pathway appears important, and evidence of AKT activation is seen in approximately 30% of
tumor biopsies.9 Phosphatase and tensin homolog
(PTEN) overexpression, seen in approximately 10% of
patients, appears to be a poor prognostic marker and is
associated with invasion and chemoresistance.9,10 The
mTOR inhibitor everolimus (RAD001) was first evaluated in a phase 2 trial of previously treated gastric and
GEJ tumors (n 5 53), with an encouraging median survival of 10.1 months.11 However, a phase 3 trial randomized 653 patients to best supportive care or everolimus
therapy and failed to show a benefit from everolimus12;
this indicates that other methods of inhibiting the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathways are necessary.
MK-2206 is the first allosteric inhibitor of AKT to
enter clinical development.13,14 MK-2206 has demonstrated AKT inhibition and antiproliferative activity as a
single agent and in combination with other agents in multiple human cancer cell lines.13,14 Phase 1 studies established 2 dosing regimens for further evaluation: 60 mg
every other day and 150 mg weekly.15 Chronic dosing was
well tolerated in early studies, with common side effects
(mostly grade 1/2) being skin rash, nausea, pruritus,
hyperglycemia, and diarrhea.15
At the time of the study initiation and during the
accrual period, there was no standard therapy available for
advanced gastric/GEJ cancer patients who had progressed
2194

on a first-line regimen. A significant number of patients
have an adequate performance status after first-line therapy, and the development of a well-tolerated and effective
regimen was the objective of this phase 2 trial with the targeted agent MK-2206.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Eligibility

The protocol was approved by the institutional review
board at each participating site, and written consent was
obtained from all patients before enrollment. The study
was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov before patients were
enrolled (NCT01260701). Eligible patients (Zubrod performance status of 0-1) had histologically or cytologically
proven gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma. Patients had
advanced, surgically inoperable, measurable disease
(according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors 1.1). Evidence of disease progression after firstline treatment or recurrence within 6 months after adjuvant therapy was required. Previous adjuvant radiotherapy
was permitted, with or without concurrent chemotherapy.
Patients had evidence of adequate hematologic, renal, hepatic, and coagulation function. Acceptable cardiac function required a QTcF (by Fridericia’s calculation) < 450
milliseconds (for males) or < 470 milliseconds (for
females) and an absence of a history of congenital long
QT syndrome, the use of concomitant medications that
could prolong the QTc interval, New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure, a history of myocardial infarction within 6 months before registration, and
uncontrolled dysrhythmias and poorly controlled angina.
A fasting blood sugar level  150 mg/dL and a hemoglobin A1c level < 7% were also required. Pertinent
exclusion criteria were the use of warfarin, brain metastasis, grade 2 or higher malabsorption or chronic diarrhea,
chemotherapy or radiotherapy within the 3 weeks (6
weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) before registration, and prior treatment with a PI3K, AKT, or mTOR
inhibitor.
Drug Administration

MK-2206 at the dose of 60 mg every other day was
administered 2 hours before or 2 hours after a meal.
Treatment was continued until the progression of disease
or unacceptable toxicity. One cycle of therapy was 28
days. A treatment delay for >3 weeks for any reason also
resulted in study discontinuation. Therapy was held for
grade 3 or higher drug-related adverse events until recovery to grade 1 or lower, and therapy was resumed with a
dose reduction. Two dose reductions to 45 and 30 mg

were permitted. In the case of prolonged or medically concerning grade 2 toxicity (ie, diarrhea and rash), therapy
was interrupted until recovery to grade 1 or lower, and it
was resumed at the same dose.
Study Evaluations

The patient history was taken, and a physical examination, an electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests (including
fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c) were performed
before study entry and then every 2 weeks during the
study. A radiological evaluation of disease was performed
every 8 weeks. The Common Terminology Criteria for
Adverse Events (version 4.0) were used for toxicity and serious adverse event reporting.
Study Statistics

The primary objective of this study was to estimate the
OS for patients with advanced gastric/GEJ adenocarcinomas treated with MK-2206. In comparison with a historical control OS of 5 months, a median OS of 6.5 months
was considered promising for MK-2206 (the study had a
power of 89% and a significance level of 0.07). The secondary objectives were to estimate the progression-free
survival, to estimate the response rate (according to
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1), and
to assess the frequency and severity of toxicities associated
with this regimen. The study required 60 evaluable
patients. An interim analysis was performed for the first
24 eligible patients. A 4-month OS  50% was required
in this group to proceed to the next stage.
RESULTS
The study accrued 75 patients; 70 were evaluable for the
study, and 5 were not evaluable because of ineligibility at
the baseline (n 5 4) or patient withdrawal after registration (n 5 1). The accrual period was 28 months (January
2011 to May 2013) at 22 Southwest Oncology Group
sites. The interim analysis for the first 24 eligible patients
met the criteria of 4-month OS  50%, and the study
proceeded to complete accrual. The median age was 59.8
years (range, 30.4-86.7 years). The study population consisted of males (70%), females (30%), whites (89%), and
Asians (7%; Table 1). Postprotocol therapy was administered to 30 patients (43%).
Safety and Toxicity

There were 2 deaths during the study possibly related to
the study drug (cardiac arrest and respiratory failure).
Grade 4 adverse events were hyperglycemia, anemia, and
lung infection (1 patient each). Grade 3 adverse events
were infrequent and occurred < 5% of patients except for

skin (19%), maculopapular rash (30%), and acneiform
rash (13%; Table 2).
Efficacy

As of August 19, 2014 (the data analysis date), 6 patients
were alive. The radiological partial response rate was 1%
(n 5 1), and stable disease was seen in 20% (n 5 14). The
median progression-free survival was 1.8 months (95%
confidence interval, 1.7-1.8 months), and the median OS
was 5.1 months (95% confidence interval, 3.7-9.4
months; Figs. 1 and 2).
DISCUSSION
MK-2206 as second-line therapy was well tolerated
with mostly grade 1/2 side effects. There was some
indication of modest activity with a radiological partial response in 1 patient and stable disease seen in
20%. The median OS was 5.1 months and did not
meet the study efficacy endpoint of 6.5 months. A limitation of our study was that therapy was performed
in unselected patients, and tumor samples were not
collected. In addition, pharmacokinetic sampling was
2196

not performed to determine whether MK-2206
absorption in the gastrointestinal tract was affected by
factors such as prior gastrectomy and abdominal radiation. Until recently, there were no standard options
for gastric/GEJ patients who had progression on firstline therapy. Recently, randomized phase 3 trials with
previously treated patients have shown irinotecan,
docetaxel, and ramucirumab to improve survival over
best supportive care, and they are now standard
options. In these studies, patients randomized to best
supportive care alone had a median OS of 3.8
months, patients treated with ramucirumab had an
OS of 5.2 months,16 and irinotecan or docetaxel
resulted in an OS of 5.3 months.17 In addition, combination therapy can also be considered with ramucirumab and paclitaxel in the second-line setting18
because a recently published randomized study
(n 5 665) showed a survival advantage for a group
assigned to treatment with ramucirumab and paclitaxel
versus a placebo plus paclitaxel (median, 9.6 vs 7.4
months; P 5 .017).
Optimal biomarkers that can be used to select
patients for therapy with PI3K/AKT/mTOR inhibitors
are still in development. Recent work suggests that
the activity of these agents may be greater in tumors
with PTEN loss or PIK3CA mutations.19 Though not
common (<5%), AKT1 and AKT2 mutations have
also been described in gastric cancer.20 Trastuzumab is
an important agent for Her2/neu-overexpressing gastric cancer. However, resistance eventually develops
with therapy, and recent preclinical studies have
shown a strong association between PI3K/PTEN activation and resistance to trastuzumab.21 Thus, future
studies with MK-2206 and other related agents in
gastric cancer should consider patient stratification by
the PI3K/PTEN/AKT status and/or demonstrate progression on trastuzumab. Combination therapy should
be evaluated because MK-2206 in preclinical studies
has shown an additive or synergistic effect with a
number of commonly used chemotherapeutic agents
such as erlotinib, lapatinib, doxorubicin, gemcitabine,
5-fluorouracil, docetaxel, and carboplatin in lung
NCI-H460 cells and ovarian A2780 tumor cells.14
MK-2206 continues to be actively investigated;
there are a wide variety of ongoing or completed phase 2
trials (approximately 40) in multiple tumor types with
MK-2206 used as a single agent or in combination with
trastuzumab, taxanes, and platinum.22 Results of these
studies as well as inhibitors targeting other AKT isoforms13 with correlative biomarkers and patient selection
