Abstract
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of blindness worldwide, is as prevalent
as cancer in industrialized nations. Most blindness in AMD results from invasion of the retina by
choroidal neovascularization (CNV). We report that the eosinophil/mast cell chemokine receptor
CCR3 is specifically expressed in CNV endothelial cells in humans with AMD, and that, despite
the expression of its ligands eotaxin-1, -2, and -3, neither eosinophils nor mast cells are present in
human CNV. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of CCR3 or eotaxins inhibited injury-induced
CNV in mice. CNV suppression by CCR3 blockade was due to direct inhibition of endothelial cell
proliferation, and was uncoupled from inflammation as it occurred in mice lacking eosinophils or
mast cells and was independent of macrophage and neutrophil recruitment. CCR3 blockade was
more effective at reducing CNV than vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)
neutralization, which is currently in clinical use, and, unlike VEGF-A blockade, not toxic to the
mouse retina. In vivo imaging with CCR3-targeting quantum dots located spontaneous CNV
invisible to standard fluorescein angiography in mice before retinal invasion. CCR3 targeting
might reduce vision loss due to AMD through early detection and therapeutic angioinhibition.

Author Manuscript

AMD affects 30-50 million people globally, with approximately 90% of severe vision loss
attributed to CNV1. The worldwide prevalence of CNV is expected to double in the next
decade due to population aging. Targeting the pro-angiogenic cytokine vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF)-A has been validated in patients with CNV2-4. However, substantial
improvement of vision occurs only in one-third of patients treated with VEGF-A
antagonists, and one-sixth of treated patients still progress to legal blindness. Moreover,
safety concerns with continual blockade of VEGF-A, which is constitutively expressed in
the normal adult human retina5, are emerging6,7. Thus, treatment strategies based on more
specific targeting of CNV are desirable. However, no molecular marker specific for human
CNV has yet been reported.

CCR3 expression restricted to CNV in human eyes

Author Manuscript

In our studies examining the role of chemokines in angiogenesis, we discovered that CCR3
(also known as CD193), a chemokine receptor best known for its role in promoting
eosinophil and mast cell trafficking8, was expressed in human choroidal endothelial cells
(CECs) only in the context of CNV due to AMD and not in other non-proliferating or
proliferating choroidal vasculature (Fig. 1). Immunolocalization studies showed that CCR3
was expressed in CECs of all examined specimens of surgically excised CNV tissue from
patients with AMD (18/18) who had received no prior treatment for AMD (Fig. 1a, b;
Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, CCR3 was not expressed in CECs in the choroid of any
patients with early (atrophic) AMD (0/10) or in age-matched patients without AMD (0/10)
(Fig. 1c, d). CCR3 also was not immunolocalized in surgically excised tissue from patients
with epiretinal fibrotic membranes (0/6) or in CECs in patients with choroidal melanoma
(0/8) (Fig. 1e, f). Collectively these data point to a highly specific pattern of expression of
CCR3 (P = 7×10−14, exact contingency table test) in CECs in neovascular AMD. In
addition, we identified the expression of the CCR3 ligands eotaxin-1 (CCL11), -2 (CCL24),
and -3 (CCL26) in all examined specimens of surgically excised CNV tissue from patients
with AMD who had received no prior treatment for AMD (Fig. 1g-j), suggesting that the

eotaxin-CCR3 axis could play a role in this disease state. Interestingly, despite the
abundance of eotaxins, eosinophils and mast cells were not identified in human CNV
(Supplementary Fig. S2), consistent with earlier findings9.

CCR3 stimulation promotes CEC migration and proliferation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

The best elucidated pathological functions of CCR3 to date have been its role in allergic
diseases such as asthma10-14 and eosinophilic esophagitis15. There is a single report of its
direct role in angiogenesis16. Although eosinophils and mast cells have been reported to be
involved in angiogenesis17,18, such actions are considered minor or isolated. Therefore, we
studied the effects of CCR3 modulation on angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. Neutralizing
anti-CCR3 antibodies inhibited the tube formation of primary human CECs cultured in
Matrigel in vitro (Fig. 2a). In an experimental model of CNV induced by laser injury in
wild-type mice19-24, neutralizing anti-CCR3 antibodies reduced the fraction of CECs in
vivo that was in the proliferative state of the cell cycle (Fig. 2b). Consistent with this finding,
each of the three eotaxins stimulated human CEC proliferation (Fig. 2c). Cytoskeletal
rearrangement through polymerization of monomeric actin to microfilamentous F-actin,
which is essential for eosinophil chemotaxis induced by the eotaxins, is also critical in
angiogenic migration of endothelial cells. Stimulation of human CECs with any of the three
eotaxins induced a rapid polymerization of actin molecules (Fig. 2d, e). All three eotaxins
also activated Rac-1 (Supplementary Fig. S3), a small GTPase that is critical in regulating
endothelial cell spreading and migration, and promoted human CEC migration in a dosedependent fashion (Fig. 2f). Collectively these data demonstrate that CCR3 activation can
promote multiple steps of angiogenesis. The expression of CCR3 on CECs in vivo is
confined to CNV tissues; however, in vitro, human CECs responded to CCR3 ligands. This
might be due to the presence of several CNV-promoting growth factors in the culture
medium.

CCR3 receptor or ligand antagonism inhibits CNV

Author Manuscript

We studied the in vivo effects of CCR3 targeting in a mouse model of CNV induced by laser
injury22 that is the most widely utilized animal model of this disease. A single intraocular
administration of either CCR3 neutralizing antibodies or a small molecule CCR3 receptor
antagonist ((S)-Methyl-2-naphthoylamino-3-(4-nitrophenyl)propionate) both suppressed
laser injury-induced CNV in wild-type mice in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 3a-c). CNV
was also diminished in Ccr3−/− mice25 compared to wild-type mice (Fig. 3d). The
specificity of pharmacological CCR3 blockade was confirmed by demonstrating that CNV
was not reduced in Ccr3−/− mice by CCR3 neutralizing antibodies or CCR3 receptor
antagonist (116±7% and 109±16% of control, respectively; n = 5; P > 0.1). CCL-11 and
CCL-24, the principal mouse ligands for CCR3, were markedly increased soon after laser
injury and immunolocalized to the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), which is adjacent to
CECs (Fig. 3e, f). Also, human RPE cells synthesized all three eotaxins (Supplementary Fig.
S4), implicating these cells, which are abundantly interspersed in CNV9, as a source of
CCR3 ligands in CNV. Genetic ablation of either Ccl11 (ref. 26) or Ccl24 (ref. 12) reduced
CNV, while the neovascular response in Ccl11−/− × Ccl24−/− mice12 was suppressed to a
greater extent than in either of the “single knockout” mice, suggesting cooperation between

these two ligands in this system (Fig. 3g). A single intraocular administration of neutralizing
antibodies against CCL-11 or CCL-24 also suppressed CNV in wild-type mice (Fig. 3h, i),
validating these CCR3 ligands as anti-angiogenic targets. Together, these data demonstrate
that CCR3 activation is essential for in vivo angiogenesis in the most widely used preclinical
model of neovascular AMD.

CCR3-driven angiogenesis uncoupled from inflammation

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

We sought to determine whether CCR3 targeting reduced CNV solely via anti-angiogenic
mechanisms or whether anti-inflammatory mechanisms also were involved. Neither
eosinophils nor mast cells (defined as CCR3hiCD3−CD117intCD49d+ and
CCR3intCD3−CD117hiCD49d+ cells, respectively) were recruited to the choroid following
laser injury, as monitored by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. S5). Furthermore, the
CNV response in eosinophil-deficient Δdbl GATA mice11 and mast cell-deficient KitW-v/
KitW-v mice27 was not different from that in wild-type mice (Fig. 3j). In addition,
intraocular administration of neutralizing anti-CCR3 antibodies reduced CNV in Δdbl
GATA or KitW-v/KitW-v mice to the same extent as in wild-type mice. Thus, although
eosinophils and mast cells have been reported to be capable of driving angiogenesis in other
systems17,18, both cell types are dispensable in the development of experimental CNV.
Although neutrophil and macrophage infiltration are crucial for the development of
experimental CNV23,28, CCR3 receptor targeting did not affect recruitment of either
inflammatory cell type (defined as Gr-1+F4/80− and F4/80+CD11c− cells, respectively)
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, the angioinhibitory effect of CCR3 blockade in this
model is a direct anti-vascular effect and does not appear to involve modulation of cellular
inflammation. The mechanisms underlying the paucity of eosinophils and mast cells in CNV
remain to be defined. One potential explanation could be the expression of CXCL9, which
blocks eotaxin-induced CCR3-mediated eosinophil recruitment29,30, in CNV
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Other mechanisms influencing adhesion or mobilization of these
leukocytes also might be operative.

CNV bioimaging by CCR3 targeting

Author Manuscript

Because invasion of the retina by CNV results in morphological and functional disruption of
the retina, early detection of CNV is desirable; indeed, detection of CNV before retinal
invasion would be ideal. CNV that has breached the retina can be detected by fluorescein
angiography. However, this diagnostic modality cannot detect CNV before it has invaded
the retina, i.e., when it is still limited to the choroid. Yet postmortem histopathological
studies have shown that substantial numbers of patients in whom fluorescein angiography
does not reveal the presence of CNV nevertheless have CNV that has not yet invaded the
retina31. Therefore, we explored whether CCR3-targeted bioimaging using anti-CCR3 Fab
antibody fragments (Supplementary Fig. S7) conjugated to quantum dots (QDot-CCR3 Fab)
could detect CNV before it became clinically evident.
We previously described the spontaneous development of CNV in senescent mice deficient
in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL-2) or its CCR2 receptor32. Similar
pathology occurs at a younger age in Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice (unpublished data). These mice

also undergo outer retinal degeneration rapidly (Supplementary Fig. S8). We tested whether
fundus angiography following intravenous injection of QDot-CCR3 Fab could detect
subretinal CNV in these mice. QDot-CCR3 Fab angiography demonstrated hyperfluorescent
signals in regions of the fundus of these mice that were silent on fluorescein angiography
(Fig. 4a,b). The specificity of CCR3 targeting was confirmed by the absence of
hyperfluorescent signals in Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice injected with QDot-isotype Fab and in
wild-type mice injected with QDot-CCR3 Fab (Fig. 4b; Supplementary Fig. S9).
Histological examination of these areas revealed proliferating (Ki67+) CCR3+ blood vessels
in the choroid that had not yet invaded the retina, along with accumulation of QDot-CCR3
Fab in these vessels (Fig. 4c-e). These data provide proof of principle that CCR3-targeted
bioimaging can detect subclinical CNV before it disrupts the retina and causes vision loss.

CCR3 targeting superior to VEGF-A targeting
Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

In comparing CCR3 targeting to VEGF-A targeting, the most effective approved treatment
for human CNV, we found that CCR3 neutralizing antibodies were more effective than
VEGF-A neutralizing antibodies (68±3% vs. 57±4%) at inhibiting laser-induced CNV in
mice (Supplementary Fig. S10). In the laser injury model, CCR3 neutralization did not
change VEGF-A levels in the RPE/choroid and VEGF-A blockade did not change CCR3
expression on CECs (Supplementary Fig. S11): these two pathways appear to be not directly
coupled. Repeated intravitreous administration of anti-VEGF-A antibodies resulted in
anatomic and functional damage to the retina in wild-type mice (Supplementary Fig. S12),
consistent with earlier reports that anti-VEGF-A therapy induces dysfunction in and damage
to the inner and outer murine retina6,7. These effects were modest at a dose of anti-VEGF-A
antibodies that suppressed mouse CNV but more pronounced at a higher dose that is
comparable to the dose used in humans. It should be noted that anti-VEGF-A
pharmacotherapy has not been associated with an increased risk of profound retinal damage
in humans33, but subtle abnormalities have been observed34,35 and some adverse effects
might be misattributed to disease progression. In contrast to VEGF-A blockade, neither
CCR3 Ab nor CCR3 receptor antagonist induced retinal toxicity in wild-type mice as
confirmed by fundus imaging and electrophysiological function (Supplementary Fig. S12).
Vegfa deletion is embryonically lethal36,37 and conditional ablation of Vegfa in the RPE
induces profound retinal degeneration and visual dysfunction38. In contrast, the Ccr3−/−
mouse retina was normal in appearance and electrophysiological function (Supplementary
Fig. S13).

Discussion
Author Manuscript

Our findings suggest that CCR3 targeting may be a safe and viable strategy for early
detection (using biocompatible quantum dots or other bioimaging fluorochromes such as
near infrared dyes) and treatment of CNV (by receptor or ligand targeting) that might be
superior to current standard of care. CCR3 bioimaging is likely to be most useful in
individuals with RPE pigmentary disturbances and multiple subretinal lipoproteinaceous
deposits known as drusen or fellow eye involvement with clinically evident CNV, as they
are known to be at high risk for developing CNV39,40. Similar techniques might be useful

in non-invasively bioimaging other metabolic or molecular markers to provide information
about disease pathogenesis or activity.
Several strategies have yielded molecular markers that are preferentially expressed on
proliferating endothelial cells such as those in tumour vasculature41,42; however, CCR3 has
not been identified in any of these reports. Therefore, our studies identify CCR3 as a novel
marker of pathological angiogenesis and as a functional target in neovascular AMD. These
findings also should prompt a search for genetic polymorphisms in the eotaxin-CCR3 axis in
patients with AMD, and investigations of CCR3 function in other models of angiogenesis.
Also, it is tempting to speculate that targeting CCR3 might provide dual benefits in asthma,
which involves varying degrees of eosinophilic inflammation as well as angiogenic airway
remodelling43.

CCR3 bioimaging

Author Manuscript

F(ab) fragments were created from monoclonal IgG2a antibody raised against the
extracellular domain of murine CCR3 (R&D Systems) and an isotype rat IgG2a (R&D
Systems) using a commercially available papain-based kit (Pierce). Recovered fragments
were conjugated with quantum dots (Invitrogen, QDot-800) and resuspended in sterile PBS.
Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice were administered 100 μg of tagged CCR3 F(ab) or isotype F(ab)
via tail vein injection after acquiring baseline fluorescent imaging using a Topcon retinal
camera (TRC-50IX). Serial images were then acquired at 1, 4, and 12 h after which eyes
were harvested and frozen in OCT for immunofluorescent analyses. Retinal images were
analyzed (ImageNet, Topcon) by comparison to baseline and fluorescein angiographic data.
Hyperfluorescent areas were then cropped, equally thresholded, and pseudocoloured
(Photoshop CS3, Adobe). Sections from QDot-conjugated CCR3 or rat IgG2a isotype F(ab)
injected animals were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 5% normal donkey
serum/5% goat serum in PBS, stained with rat anti-mouse CD31 (BD Biosciences) and

Tube formation assay

Author Manuscript

96-well plates were coated with Growth Factor Reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences) mixed
with rat neutralizing antibody against human CCR3 (20 μg/ml, R&D Systems) or control rat
IgG2a (Invitrogen) and allowed to solidify in the incubator at 37 °C for 45 min. Human
choroidal endothelial cells (CECs)44-47 were plated on top of the Matrigel at 2.25 ×
104/cm2 in EBM-2 basal media (Cambrex) containing 1% FBS with CCR3 antibody or rat
IgG2a at the above concentrations and allowed to grow overnight. Tube formation was
analyzed by counting the number of cell junctions per mm2.
Proliferation assay

Author Manuscript

Human CECs were synchronized for cell cycle state by first cultivating them in EGM2-MV
media (Lonza) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco) to achieve complete confluence and
then by overnight serum starvation in MCDB131 media (Gibco) with 0.1% FBS. They were
passaged to 96-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well, followed by stimulation for
24 h with eotaxin-1, 2 or 3 (10 ng, 100 ng and 2 μg per ml, respectively; Peprotech) in
MCDB131 media with 0.1% FBS. After 24 h, cell viability was measured with BrdU ELISA
(Chemicon) according to manufacturer's instructions.
F-actin Polymerization Assay

Author Manuscript

Human CECs were seeded in black-walled 96-well plates and grown to 70-80% confluence
in fully supplemented EGM-2MV. Cultures were serum starved overnight in basal media
and then stimulated with recombinant human eotaxin-1 (10 ng/ml), eotaxin-2 (100 ng/ml),
eotaxin-3 (2 μg/ml) (Peprotech), or vehicle control (PBS). At 0, 10, 30, 60, or 120 sec timepoints, cells were fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed, permeabilized in
PBS with 0.1% Triton-X, and then stained with rhodamine labelled Phalloidin (1:200,
Invitrogen) per manufacturer's recommendations. Plates were analyzed on a fluorescent
plate reader (Synergy 4, Biotek) followed by fluorescent microscopy (Nikon E800).
Migration Assay
Eotaxins-1, -2, -3 were reconstituted in 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and then mixed
with Matrigel diluted 1:1 with serum free endothelial basal media (EBM-2; Lanza). 500 μl
of EBM-2 was added to each well of a 24-well plate followed by a 6.5 mm diameter
Transwell insert (8 μm pores; Corning). Human CECs in EBM-2 were prestained with

Vybrant DiO (Invitrogen) for 30 min at 37 °C and seeded into the inserts at 50,000 cells per
200 μl of serum free EBM-2 media. The plates were allowed to incubate for 16 h at 37 °C,
5% CO2. The migrated cells were imaged with an Olympus CK40 microscope and Olympus
DP71 camera.
Rac-1 activation
Human CECs were cultured in EGM-2 MV containing 5% FBS. Prior to starting the assay,
cells were serum starved with basal medium (MCDB131) supplemented with 1% FBS
overnight. Cells were stimulated for designated times with Eotaxin-1, 2 and 3 (10 ng/ml, 100
ng/ml and 2 μg/ml respectively). Equal amounts of lysates (500 μg) were incubated with
GST-Pak1-PBD agarose beads (Upstate) to pull-down active GTP-bound Rac-1 at 4 °C for 1
h with rotation. The samples were subsequently analyzed for bound Rac-1 by western blot
analysis using an anti-Rac-1 antibody (Upstate).

CCR3-targeting quantum dots detect subretinal choroidal neovascularization (CNV). a,
Images of the fundus taken after intravenous injection of sodium fluorescein in wild-type
and Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mice showed normal retinal vascular filling but no areas of
hyperfluorescence indicative of CNV. b, After intravenous injection of QDot-CCR3 Fab in
the same Ccl2−/− × Ccr2−/− mouse shown in (a), focal branching choroidal
hyperfluorescence was visualized (arrow) at 1 h in the same area that was not
hyperfluorescent during fluorescein angiography (arrowhead in a). The intensity of this
hyperfluorescence (shown in red pseudocolour in the inset) increased, attaining a peak at 4
h, and then declined in intensity but still persisted at 12 h. Corresponding images of QDotIsotype Fab angiography showed no hyperfluorescence. c–e, The region corresponding to
the area of hyperfluorescence seen on QDot-CCR3 Fab angiography in (b) contained
multiple CD31+ blood vessels in the choroid (Ch) that were proliferating (Ki67+; arrows)
