SUMMARY
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The breast cancer susceptibility protein, BRCA2, is essential for recombinational DNA repair.
BRCA2 delivers RAD51 to double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) breaks through interaction with eight
conserved, ~35 amino acid motifs, the BRC repeats. Here we show that the solitary BRC4 promotes
assembly of RAD51 onto single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), but not dsDNA, to stimulate DNA strand
exchange. BRC4 acts by blocking ATP hydrolysis and thereby maintaining the active ATP-bound
form of the RAD51-ssDNA filament. Single-molecule visualization shows that BRC4 does not
disassemble RAD51-dsDNA filaments, but rather blocks nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA.
Furthermore, this behavior is manifest by a domain of BRCA2 comprising all eight BRC repeats.
These results establish that the BRC repeats modulate RAD51-DNA interaction in two opposing,
but functionally reinforcing ways: targeting active RAD51 to ssDNA and prohibiting RAD51
nucleation onto dsDNA. Thus, BRCA2 recruits RAD51 to DNA breaks and, we propose, the BRC
repeats regulate DNA binding selectivity.

INTRODUCTION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The breast cancer susceptibility gene, BRCA2, encodes a protein of 3,418 amino acids (Wooster
et al., 1995). BRCA2 is needed for DNA repair by homologous recombination (Moynahan et
al., 2001; Tutt et al., 2001), the predominant mechanism employed by cells to accurately repair
double-strand breaks (DBSs). The inability to purify full-length BRCA2 protein has hampered
analysis of its role in this essential biological process. However, crystallographic studies
revealed that BRCA2 possesses both a DNA Binding Domain (DBD), with unique structural
features for binding ssDNA and dsDNA (Yang et al., 2002), and BRC repeats, which bind to
the core of RAD51 by mimicking the structure of an adjacent RAD51 monomer (Pellegrini et
al., 2002). Electron microscopy uncovered two different loci for binding to RAD51, the Nterminal domain and the nucleotide binding core (Galkin et al., 2005). In addition, another
RAD51 binding site was mapped to the C-terminus of BRCA2 (Esashi et al., 2007). Together,

these results suggest that the intact BRCA2 protein might bind both DNA and RAD51, and
deliver RAD51 to the sites of DNA breaks (Kowalczykowski, 2005; Pellegrini et al., 2002;
Shin et al., 2003; Yang et al., 2002).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The importance of the BRC motifs to BRCA2 function in the maintenance of genome integrity
is supported by observations showing that point mutations within BRC which compromise
interactions with RAD51 are found in individuals predisposed to breast cancer (Breast Cancer
Information Core, http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/bic/). At least one BRC repeat, in concert with
the DBD of BRCA2, is required for targeting RAD51 to ssDNA (San Filippo et al., 2006).
Moreover, a fusion of a BRC repeat with the large subunit of the human ssDNA-binding
protein, Replication protein-A (RPA), is sufficient to suppress cellular defects found in
brca2 mutant mammalian cells (Saeki et al., 2006). In fact, exogenous expression of mutants
deleted for the BRC repeats or with missense mutations that give rise to familial cancers
eliminate the ability of BRCA2 to restore resistance to methyl methanesulphonate (MMS)
(Chen et al., 1998). However, apparently contradictory effects reported for the BRC repeats
on RAD51 behavior have confounded molecular understanding of their function. For instance,
BRC repeats are reported to both block assembly of the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament on
dsDNA and to paradoxically stabilize the same nucleoprotein filament (Chen et al., 1999;
Davies et al., 2001; Galkin et al., 2005; Shivji et al., 2006). These seemingly disparate
observations may simply reflect experimental differences amongst the various studies or,
instead, they may suggest an unappreciated complexity in the mechanism by which the BRC
repeats regulate RAD51 function. Here we use ensemble and single-molecule methods to
examine the effects of the BRC4 repeat on RAD51 nucleoprotein filament assembly on both
ssDNA and dsDNA. We uncover a dichotomy with regard to the effect of BRC4 and a BRCA2
domain including the eight repeats, BRCA2BRC1-8, on these two types of DNA: BRC4 and
BRCA2BRC1-8 stabilize filament formation on ssDNA, but prevent filament formation on
dsDNA. The consequence of this control over DNA selection results in an enhancement of the
DNA strand exchange activity of RAD51 protein by the BRC repeats that we propose is a
function within the intact BRCA2 protein.

RESULTS
BRC4 and BRCA2BRC1-8 stimulate the formation of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on ssDNA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Because prior studies had not specifically focused on the role of BRC repeats in RAD51
nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA, we decided to first examine the effect of the well
characterized BRC4 repeat (Pellegrini et al., 2002) on the assembly of RAD51 onto ssDNA.
BRC4 was purified as a fusion with glutathione-S-transferase (GST); as controls, a GST-fused
repeat with a deletion, Δ1524-30, and a GST-fused repeat with a point mutation, T1526A,
(Figure S1) each of which fails to bind RAD51 (Chen et al., 1999; Davies et al., 2001)
(confirmed using a GST-pull down assays; data not shown) were also purified. For the ssDNA,
to avoid the ambiguity introduced by dsDNA that results from secondary structure forming
within native ssDNA, the homopolymer, dT40, was initially used. BRC4 was incubated with
RAD51, ssDNA added, and then the complexes were analyzed using electrophoretic mobility
shift assays (EMSA). As expected, BRC4 alone does not bind the ssDNA (Figure 1A, lane 1).
In the presence of ATP, the RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments are partially stable and only ~30%
of the DNA is shifted (Figure 1A, lane 2). The addition of BRC4 unexpectedly produced a
BRC4 concentration-dependent increase in RAD51-ssDNA complexes from 30% to almost
100% (lanes 3-8), whereas the control peptides, Δ1524-30 (lanes 9 and 10, and Figure 1B) or
T1526A (Figure 1B), had no effect. Maximum stimulation occurred at about 12 μM of peptide,
and then declined at higher concentrations of BRC4 (Figure 1A, B, C).
The EMSA in Figure 1A was obtained using a mixture of Ca2+ and Mg2+, which resulted in
better defined RAD51-ssDNA complexes due to their greater kinetic stability imparted by the

Ca2+ (Bugreev and Mazin, 2004). However, even when Ca2+ was omitted, BRC4 stabilized
the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament (Figure 1B, “ATP (Mg2+)”). BRC4 also increased RAD51ssDNA complex formation when either dT60 or dT70 were used (data not shown). When an
oligonucleotide with a random 26 nucleotide sequence was used, nucleoprotein complex
formation was stimulated by BRC4 from 3% to 15%; the use of longer mixed sequence DNA
resulted in complex formation with RAD51 that involved more than 75% of the DNA,
precluding detection of stimulation by BRC4 (data not shown). The presence of the GST tag
did not affect the results, as an untagged BRC4 peptide also stimulated binding (Figure S2).
When the concentrations of RAD51 were reduced (10- and 20-fold), both the profile and
optimum for stimulation by BRC4 were proportionally shifted (Figure 1C), indicating that the
stimulatory effect of BRC4 is the consequence of forming a defined complex with RAD51 and
not a non-specific effect (Davies et al., 2001; Galkin et al., 2005); at these lower concentrations,
the binding of BRC4 to RAD51 is not stoichiometric, requiring excess amounts of BRC4 to
drive binding to RAD51. To confirm that these effects were not unique to the BRC4 repeat, a
domain corresponding to all eight of the BRC repeats, BRCA2BRC1-8, was examined (Shivji
et al., 2006). A similar profile of stimulation was observed with BRCA2BRC1-8; due to
limitations of the protein stock, higher BRCA2BRC1-8 concentrations could not be examined
(Figure 1C). This finding shows that the BRC4 repeat and BRCA2BRC1-8 behave similarly.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Interestingly, either when Ca2+ replaced the Mg2+ to prevent the hydrolysis of ATP (Bugreev
and Mazin, 2004), or when the non-hydrolysable analogue, AMP-PNP, was used, BRC4 did
not stimulate the binding of RAD51 to ssDNA but rather inhibited filament formation (Figure
1B). These results suggest that the stabilization of nucleoprotein filaments by BRC4 requires
ATP hydrolysis by the nucleoprotein filament. Finally, BRC4 appeared to have little or no
effect when ATP was replaced by ADP (Figure 1B) but, because the ADP-complex is more
stable than the ATP-bound form (Kim et al., 2002) (and unpublished observations), this
increased stability precluded detection of a stabilizing effect. Therefore, to measure the effect
of BRC4 on ADP-RAD51-ssDNA complexes, we examined the dissociation of these
complexes due to elevated salt concentrations. Figure 1D shows that BRC4 increased the
stability of the ADP-RAD51-ssDNA complexes against dissociation at high NaCl
concentrations. Thus, BRC4 stabilizes RAD51-ssDNA filaments only when hydrolysis of ATP
to ADP is permitted, or when ADP is present initially.
BRC4 prevents ssDNA dependent ATP hydrolysis by RAD51, thereby maintaining the active
ATP-bound form of the filament

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

To understand the mechanism by which BRC4 stabilizes RAD51-ssDNA complexes, we
explored the effect of BRC4 on the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of RAD51. BRC4
reduced ATP hydrolysis by RAD51 for all the ssDNA examined, both homopolymers and
natural DNA (Figure 2A). In the absence of BRC4, the rate of ATP hydrolysis was fastest for
the shorter ssDNA due, likely, to the more dynamic nature of the filaments on shorter DNA.
In all cases, BRC4 reduced the hydrolysis rate to the DNA-independent rate, while the control
peptide had no effect (Figure 2A). This inhibition of ATP hydrolysis was not due to dissociation
of the nucleoprotein filaments, since BRC4 stabilized the complexes under these conditions
(Figure 1). Finally, BRC4 also inhibited similarly the ATPase activity of RAD51 when RPA
was present (Figure S3), showing that the effects of BRC4 are not altered by RPA.
Because BRC4 could prevent ATP hydrolysis at a number of different steps in the ATP
hydrolysis cycle (e.g., by blocking ATP binding, ADP dissociation, or the catalytic step), we
sought to determine which nucleotide was bound to the BRC4-inhibited filament. To determine
whether BRC4 affected the proportion of ATP and ADP bound to the RAD51 nucleoprotein,
we used a modified version of an assay described previously (Bugreev and Mazin, 2004).
Nucleoprotein filaments were formed in the presence of [α-32P] ATP, isolated from free

nucleotides, and then the nucleotide (ATP/ADP) composition of the filament was measured
(Figure 2B, C and D). BRC4 reduced the fraction of ADP bound, and concomitantly increased
the amount of ATP bound to nucleoprotein filaments formed on either dT40 (Figure 2B, upper
panel) or ϕX174 ssDNA (Figure 2B, lower panel). The relative increase in amount of
nucleotide-bound (for both ATP and ADP) complexes (4-fold for dT40 and more than 10-fold
for ϕX174 ssDNA) correlates with the stabilization of the ssDNA complexes shown in Figure
1. More significantly, in the presence of BRC4, the resulting filaments contain nearly 100%
ATP (Figure 2D). These results provide direct evidence that BRC4 permits accumulation of
the active, ATP-bound form of RAD51-ssDNA filament. Moreover, since BRC4 both
stimulates the assembly of RAD51 onto ssDNA only when ATP hydrolysis is occurring (Figure
1B) and stabilizes the ADP-RAD51-ssDNA complex, these findings strongly suggest that
BRC4 acts by preventing dissociation of ADP-RAD51 from ssDNA, permitting exchange of
ATP for ADP within the filament, and finally blocking ATP hydrolysis. The consequence of
these events is formation and preservation of the active ATP-RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein
filament.
BRC4 and BRCA2BRC1-8 prevent the formation of RAD51 nucleoprotein filaments on dsDNA

NIH-PA Author Manuscript
NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Given that RAD51 can bind both ssDNA and dsDNA (Baumann et al., 1996; Mazin et al.,
2000), but only the ssDNA nucleoprotein filament is functional (Sung and Robberson, 1995),
we next investigated the effect of BRC4 on the binding of RAD51 to dsDNA. RAD51 was
incubated with increasing concentrations of BRC4 prior to addition of 32P-labeled ϕX174 linear
dsDNA (Figure 3). As expected, BRC4 alone did not bind dsDNA (Figure 3A, lane 1).
However, in the presence of ATP, increasing concentrations of BRC4 inhibited binding of
RAD51 to dsDNA, which is opposite to the behavior seen with ssDNA. The control peptides,
Δ1524-30 and T1526A, did not prevent RAD51-dsDNA filament formation (Figure 3A, lanes
9 and 10, and Figure 3B). As with ssDNA binding, the GST tag did not affect the results, since
an untagged BRC4 peptide had the same effect (Figure S4A). The same outcome was obtained
when ϕX174 dsDNA was substituted with a shorter duplex DNA, dT40·dA40 (Figure 3C), and
when BRCA2BRC1-8 was employed instead of BRC4 (Figure 3D). When Ca2+ was substituted
for Mg2+, BRC4 still inhibited binding of RAD51 to dsDNA (Figure S4B). But when AMPPNP was used instead of ATP, BRC4 did not inhibit RAD51 nucleoprotein filament formation
(Figure 3B). The observation that BRC4 does not block RAD51-dsDNA binding in the
presence of AMP-PNP but does so in the presence of ATP and Ca2+ suggests that there is a
difference in the structural conformation adopted by the BRC4-RAD51 filament that is
dependent on the type of nucleotide cofactor and DNA. Previously, the amino-terminal domain
of RAD51 in dsDNA filaments was found to become dynamic when ATP was used instead of
AMP-PNP (Galkin et al., 2005), and this structural flexibility suggests that BRC4 acts to
destabilize the RAD51-dsDNA filament through a conformation state that is accessible only
when the physiological cofactor ATP is present.
The BRC repeats prevent nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA but do not disrupt a RAD51dsDNA filament
To understand the basis for the inhibition of RAD51-dsDNA complex formation by BRC4, we
examined RAD51-dsDNA nucleoprotein filaments at the single-molecule level. A
fluorescently labeled RAD51 protein (Hilario et al., in press) was used to visualize RAD51
filament formation on dsDNA following a strategy reported previously for RecA protein
(Galletto et al., 2006). Briefly, a flow cell was used to generate three separate laminar flow
channels (Figure 4A). In the capture channel (Step 1), a biotinylated bacteriophage λ DNA
molecule, stained with the fluorescent intercalating dye, YOYO-1, and attached to a
streptavidin-coated bead, was optically trapped. The bead-YOYO-1-DNA complex was then
moved into the observation channel under conditions that dissociate the dye from DNA (Step
2). This dye-free DNA was subsequently moved to the protein channel containing the

fluorescently modified RAD51, alone, with BRC4, or with Δ1524-30 (Step 3). After incubation
for the specified times in the presence of ATP and Ca2+, the trapped DNA was moved into the
observation channel (Step 4) where the bound fluorescent-RAD51 was visualized.
An example of a RAD51 filament formed by successively “dipping” a single dsDNA molecule
in the protein channel for 20 or 30 seconds each is shown in Figure 4B, left panel: within 20
sec, RAD51 was seen along much of the dsDNA, and nucleoprotein filament formation was
nearly complete in 60 sec. In marked contrast, a 4:1 molar ratio of BRC4 nearly eliminated
nucleoprotein filament nucleation (Figure 4B, middle panel): a mean of 1.5 ±1.4 nucleation
events were visible after 180 seconds (nucleation rate = 0.50 ± 0.46 min-1) (Figure 4D). At the
same concentration, the control Δ1524-30 peptide had no effect (Figure 4B; right panel). These
single-molecule results agree fully with our ensemble experiments (Figure S4B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The RAD51 nucleation frequency was seen to depend on BRC4 concentration (Figure 4D):
when reduced to 1:1 (BRC4:RAD51), nucleation was still low (1.7 ± 0.3 min-1), but upon
further reduction to 0.5:1, the rate increased to 22 ± 3.8 min-1 (Figure 4C and D). At the two
concentrations tested, 0.5:1 and 2:1 (BRCA2BRC1-8:RAD51), BRCA2BRC1-8 was found to
affect the RAD51 nucleation rate comparably to BRC4 (Figure 4C and D), substantiating the
results obtained with a single BRC repeat. In the absence of BRC4 or BRCA2BRC1-8, nucleation
was too rapid to measure reliably. The effect of increasing peptide concentration on nucleus
formation is summarized in Figure 4E; maximal inhibition of nucleation occurred at an
approximately equimolar ratio of BRC4 or BRCA2BRC1-8 to RAD51.
We next examined whether BRC4 can disrupt preformed RAD51-dsDNA filaments. RAD51
nucleoprotein filaments were formed in the protein channel as was done for the assembly
experiments, except Mg2+ was used instead of Ca2+ to permit ATP hydrolysis and subsequent
dissociation. Once the filament was fully extended (~4 min in these conditions), the DNA was
moved to the second channel containing both Mg2+ and ATP to commence disassembly. Within
experimental error, when BRC4 was present in the second channel, the rate of disassembly of
the pre-formed fluorescent RAD51-dsDNA filaments was unchanged (Figure 5A). The DNA
length is proportional to the amount of RAD51 bound (Hilario et al., 2008); hence,
measurement of the DNA length as a function of time permits quantification of the first order
rate constant for dissociation. In the presence of BRC4, RAD51 disassembles at a rate of 0.14
(± 0.05) μm min-1; in its absence, the rate is 0.17 (± 0.09) μm min-1 (Figure 5B). These data,
both the visual presence of fluorescent RAD51 and the nucleoprotein length, demonstrate that
BRC4 does not accelerate disassembly of the RAD51-dsDNA filament.
BRC4 can stimulate RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Together, the ensemble- and single-molecule experiments indicate that BRC4 stabilizes the
ATP-RAD51-ssDNA filament, but blocks filament formation on dsDNA at the nucleation
level. Therefore, we reasoned that BRC4 should also stimulate RAD51-mediated DNA strand
exchange by both promoting filament assembly on ssDNA, and preventing inhibitory filament
formation on the target dsDNA. To test this prediction, we examined DNA strand exchange
activity in the presence of RPA (Figure 6A). Initially, optimal conditions employing a
stoichiometric amount of RAD51 relative to ssDNA were used (Benson et al., 1994; Bugreev
and Mazin, 2004; Sung and Robberson, 1995). As expected, at these conditions (Figure 6B
left panel, and 6C), RAD51 promoted the formation of DNA strand exchange products, joint
molecules and nicked circular dsDNA. At these conditions, BRC4 showed a negligible
stimulation of product formation compared to the control Δ1524-30 peptide, although BRC4
did inhibit product formation at high concentrations (Figure S5A and B) due to inhibition of
RAD51 binding to the ϕX174 ssDNA at these higher BRC4 concentrations (data not shown;
see Figure 1C). However, it is well known that when the RAD51 concentration exceeds the
stoichiometric optimum with regard to ssDNA, RAD51 self-inhibits DNA strand exchange in

vitro by binding to the dsDNA target (Benson et al., 1994; Sung and Robberson, 1995). Indeed,
increasing the RAD51 concentration to 6 μM reduced product formation (Figure S5C, first
lane), and nearly completely blocked all product formation when increased further to 7.5 μM
(Figure 6B, right panel, lanes labeled “0” peptide). As predicted from our binding studies,
however, BRC4 restored product formation in a concentration-dependent manner (Figures 6B
and C, and S5C and D). The effect was most dramatic at the highest RAD51 protein
concentrations (Figure 6B and C) and, in fact, BRC4 increased the yield of the fully strandedexchanged DNA product (the nicked circular dsDNA) to levels that were higher than even the
optimal reaction (at 3.75 μM RAD51 (Figure 6 B and C); the control peptides, T1526A and
Δ1524-30, had no effect in any reaction. Thus, these results reveal a previously unrecognized
ability of BRC4 to stimulate RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Taken together, our results show that both BRC4 alone and BRCA2BRC1-8 can modulate
RAD51 filament formation in two mutually reinforcing ways: stimulating the assembly on
ssDNA and preventing nucleation onto dsDNA. This duality with regard to control of RAD51
nucleoprotein filament formation is, in turn, responsible for the regulation of RAD51-promoted
DNA strand exchange. Our results demonstrate that the interaction of BRC4 with RAD51 is
sufficient to enhance RAD51 filament assembly on ssDNA (Figure 7A, step 1). This
enhancement results from both an inhibition of ATP hydrolysis (Figure 7A, step 2) and a
stabilization of the ADP-bound form of the nucleoprotein filament (Figure 7A, step 3). The
combined consequence is to allow exchange for ATP within the filament rather than the
dissociation of ADP-RAD51 from the ssDNA. The net effect is maintenance of a protein
filament assembled on ssDNA in its ATP-bound form, which is the form that is required for
DNA pairing function. In addition, BRC4 prevents a competing inhibitory reaction: namely,
the nonfunctional assembly of RAD51 on dsDNA (Figure 7B, step 4). BRC4 achieves this
function by blocking the rate-limiting nucleation of filaments on dsDNA. The similar results
obtained with a domain comprising the eight BRC repeats, BRCA2BRC1-8, previously shown
to stimulate RAD51-mediated DNA strand exchange (Shivji et al., 2006), support the
conclusions obtained with the single BRC4 repeat, and they further suggest that the entire
BRCA2BRC1-8 domain behaves as a regulator of DNA binding much as BRC4.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Crystallographic analysis defined an interaction interface between BRC4 and RAD51 that
involves the ATPase core of RAD51 and that mimics the intermonomer interactions within the
filament (Pellegrini et al., 2002). It was found that the nucleotide-binding site of RAD51adopts
a more closed conformation when bound to BRC4, and the authors suggested that this
conformation might, in turn, alter ATP occupancy. This interpretation could provide a
structural explanation for the inhibition of the ATPase activity of RAD51 by BRC4 and the
resultant stabilization of RAD51- ssDNA filaments if the ATP binding pocket closed with ATP
bound and BRC4 prevented the conformational changes needed for ATP hydrolysis.
Paradoxically, BRC repeats were also shown both to disrupt RAD51 nucleoprotein filament
formation on dsDNA and to bind to these nucleoprotein filaments. This seemingly
contradictory outcome is likely a consequence of the two different binding modes reported for
the BRC repeats: a mode that binds RAD51 in a monomeric state and another that binds the
nucleoprotein filament, respectively (Davies et al., 2001; Galkin et al., 2005; Pellegrini et al.,
2002); a third interaction mode, described for the C-terminal region of BRCA2, reportedly
involves oligomeric RAD51 binding (Davies and Pellegrini, 2007; Esashi et al., 2007). Some
prior studies are seemingly contradictory to some of the observations reported here, but our
studies readily rationalize those findings. We showed that BRC4 will not inhibit RAD51
filament formation on dsDNA, unless the RAD51 is allowed to dissociate via ATP hydrolysis;
once dissociated, however, our studies also show that reassembly of the dissociated RAD51

protein will be blocked by BRC4, leading to an apparent disruption of the ATP-nucleoprotein
filaments. For this reason, nucleoprotein filaments formed on dsDNA in the presence of the
non-hydrolysable analog, AMP-PNP, are much less affected by BRC repeats, whereas those
assembled in the presence of ATP are apparently disrupted; however, these latter complexes
are not, in fact, disrupted by the BRC repeat but, instead, they dissociate normally and their
reassembly is blocked on a steady-state kinetic basis. In addition, BRC4 was found to inhibit
the binding of RAD51 to longer ssDNA (e.g., poly(dT)) (Davies and Pellegrini, 2007).
However, here we discovered that there are two distinct regimes of BRC4 behavior with regard
to RAD51 binding to ssDNA: stimulation at low concentrations of BRC4, and inhibition at
high concentrations. Because RAD51 forms unstable complexes with short oligonucleotides,
such as dT40 or dT60, we can detect both the stimulatory regime and the inhibitory regime
(Figure 1). However, for longer ssDNA, the binding of RAD51 is stable (close to 100%
binding); thus, the stimulatory behavior cannot be detected, and only the inhibitory behavior
is seen. This dichotomous behavior resolves the apparent discrepancy with studies using
ssDNA that forms stable complexes with RAD51.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

It was recently reported that a peptide derived from the BRC repeat of BRCA2 can inhibit the
binding of RAD51 to the fluorescently-modified ssDNA, poly(etheno-dA) (Nomme et al.,
2008); in agreement, we observed a similar behavior with M13 etheno-ssDNA (unpublished
observations). We conclude that the fluorescent modification of these ssDNA substrates
precludes the stimulation of binding seen for BRC4 with the unmodified ssDNA. Our results
show that these distinct modes of action may have disparate consequences which depend on
the type of DNA, single- or double-stranded, involved.
When considered in conjunction with previous work which showed that BRC repeats are
necessary to target RAD51 to ssDNA (San Filippo et al., 2006), our findings suggest that the
dominant negative phenotype resulting from expression of the single BRC4 in vivo (Chen et
al., 1999) arises either from the inability of an isolated repeat, without the DNA binding
domains of BRCA2, to efficiently deliver RAD51 to the site of a processed dsDNA break or
from an inhibitory effect of excessive BRC4 expression. Consistent with the former
interpretation, expression of a fusion of BRC4 and the ssDNA binding domain of a
heterologous protein, RPA, restores recombinational DNA repair in mammalian cells to nearly
wild-type levels (Saeki et al., 2006). In agreement with the latter possibility, high
concentrations of BRC4 block DNA strand exchange in vitro (Figure S5A and B).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The BRCA2-homologue from C. elegans, CeBRC2, which possesses a single BRC repeat, was
reported to reduce the rate of ATP hydrolysis by CeRAD51 in vitro and to promote persistent
CeRAD51 nucleoprotein focus formation in vivo (Petalcorin et al., 2007). In agreement, here
we showed that a single BRC repeat from the human BRCA2 is sufficient to stabilize the human
RAD51-ssDNA nucleoprotein complex by decreasing ATP hydrolysis and by both stabilizing
and increasing the fraction of active ATP-bound nucleoprotein filaments on ssDNA (Figure
2B and C). Collectively, the published reports and our results support the conclusion that BRC
repeats enhance the DNA pairing activity of RAD51 by slowing ATP hydrolysis. Interestingly,
a similar mechanism was invoked to explain the Ca2+-dependent stabilization of the RAD51ssDNA filament and the consequent stimulation of DNA strand exchange (Bugreev and Mazin,
2004). The accumulation of ATP-bound form of the filament by either Ca2+ or BRC4 promotes
formation of an active nucleoprotein filament on ssDNA that is necessary for DNA strand
exchange. The interaction with BRC4 goes one step further: it limits the non-productive
formation of filaments on dsDNA. Thus, BRC4 shows two different modes of interaction: one

Further research will be required to understand how the BRC repeats and the C-terminal region
orchestrate RAD51 nucleoprotein formation in the context of entire BRCA2 protein and
throughout the cell cycle. However, our observations have revealed an unexpected dichotomy
of the seemingly simple BRC repeats in controlling RAD51 nucleoprotein filament assembly
that might be crucial for understanding the role of BRCA2 in the DNA damage response and
repair. In Figure 7C, we illustrate the likely function of the intact BRCA2 protein. Duplex DNA
that suffers a DSB is resected to produce ssDNA. The ssDNA is initially bound by RPA,
precluding the binding of RAD51 and necessitating a catalyst to facilitate assembly of RAD51
on the ssDNA (Sugiyama and Kowalczykowski, 2002). BRCA2 is proposed to bind to the
ssDNA-dsDNA junction by virtue of its DNA binding domain, which comprises both ssDNA
and dsDNA binding domains (Yang et al., 2002; Yang et al., 2005). The BRC repeats recruit
RAD51 to this junction, and load RAD51 onto the ssDNA, but they block its non-productive
assembly onto dsDNA. The major role of BRCA2 is seen as nucleating the nucleoprotein
filament near the junction by preventing turnover of the nascent nucleus of the ATP-bound
RAD51 filament. Once a nascent filament forms, growth and RPA-displacement ensues, likely
aided by other mediators such as RAD52 (Benson et al., 1998; New et al., 1998; Shinohara
and Ogawa, 1998; Sung, 1997; Sung et al., 2003).

Electrophoretic mobility shift assay

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The procedure was essentially as described (Galkin et al., 2005). RAD51 was pre-incubated
with GST-tagged BRC4, BRCA2BRC1-8, Δ1524-30, or T1526A at the indicated concentrations
for 15 min, followed by addition of ssDNA (dT40, labeled with 32P at the 5’-end) or dsDNA
(XhoI-linearized ϕX174 dsDNA, 32P-labelled at the 5’ end or 32P-5’end labelled duplex
dT40·dA40 prepared by annealing), at the concentrations indicated, in buffer containing 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, 2 mM CaCl2, 2 mM ATP, 100 μg/ ml BSA. The mixture
was incubated for 15 min or 60 min at 37 °C, as indicated. The reaction products were resolved
by 6% PAGE at 4°C in 1 × TAE, (40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA) or using 0.5
% agarose gels at 40 V o/n (in the case of ϕX174 dsDNA) in 1 × TAE. Where indicated, ATP
was replaced with ADP or AMP-PNP (2 mM), and Mg2+ and Ca2+ were replaced by either
Mg2+ (10 mM) or Ca2+ (2 mM). The agarose gels were dried and analyzed on a Molecular
Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software. The percentage of proteinDNA complexes was quantified as the free radiolabeled DNA remaining in a given lane relative
to the protein-free lane, which defined the value of 0% complex (100% free DNA).
ATP hydrolysis assay
RAD51 (3 μM) was pre-incubated with the GST-tagged BRC4, or Δ1524-30 at 37°C for 15
min, followed by addition of ssDNA (9 μM nucleotides, nt) in 10 μl of buffer containing 20
mM TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP, and 20 μCi/ml [γ32P]ATP,
and further incubated at 37 °C for 1h. In figure S3, RPA (1 μM) or RPA storage buffer was
pre-incubated with dT40 (9 μM nt) for 5 min at 37 °C, followed by the addition of RAD51 (3
μM) and the concentrations specified of GST-tagged BRC4 in the same buffer as above, and
incubated at 37 °C for 1h. Aliquots (1 μl) were spotted onto a polyethyleneimine (PEI) thin
layer chromatography (TLC) plate (EMD Chemicals). The spots were air dried and the plates
were developed in 1 M formic acid and 0.5 M LiCl. The amount of ATP hydrolyzed was
determined from dried plates using a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager. The
amount of 32Pi and [γ32P] ATP was quantified using ImageQuant software.

Isolation and analysis of the nucleotide composition of RAD51 nucleoprotein complexes

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

RAD51 (3 μM) was pre-incubated with the GST-tagged BRC4, or Δ1524-30, at 37°C for 15
min, followed by addition of ssDNA (9 μM nt), dT40 or linear ϕX174 ssDNA. (The linear
ϕX174 ssDNA was prepared by annealing an oligonucleotide (80-mer) complementary to the
AluI restriction site contained within the sequence (5207-5286) of ϕX174 ssDNA, subsequently
cutting with AluI, and then purified using a MicroSpin S-400 HR column, (Amersham)). The
protein-DNA mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C in 20 μl of buffer containing 20 mM
TrisHCl (pH 7.5), 4 mM MgCl2, 1mM DTT, 0.5 mM ATP, and 6 μCi [α32P] ATP. Aliquots
of 1 μl were spotted on PEI plates as described above. Aliquots (19 μl) were loaded onto Micro
Bio-Spin P30 columns (Bio-Rad) pre-equilibrated in Tris-EDTA (TE (10 mM TrisHCl (pH
7.5), 1 mM EDTA), and 10 μl of the eluate was spotted on PEI plates, air dried, and analyzed
as described above. The amount of nucleotide bound to the isolated protein-DNA complexes
was calculated from the [α32P] ATP + [α32P] ADP content of each lane and expressed relative
to the amount of [α32P] ATP + [α32P] ADP bound when BRC4 was absent. The ATP and ADP
bound to free RAD51 was determined in parallel by doing the same experiment in the absence
of DNA and was subtracted from each lane of the experiment done in the presence of DNA.

The experimental protocol was similar to that reported previously (Bianco et al., 2001; Galletto
et al., 2006). A three-channel flow cell (4.5 mm wide and 70 μm deep) generated three 1.5 mm
laminar flow paths. Bacteriophage λ DNA, biotinylated at one end, was attached to a 1 μM
streptavidin-coated polystyrene bead (Bangs Laboratories). The bead-DNA complex in buffer
T (50 mM TrisOAc, pH 8.3, 15% sucrose, and 30 mM DTT), containing 10-20 nM YOYO-1,
was trapped at a linear flow rate of 180 μm s -1 at 25°C. The trapped bead-λ DNA complex
was then moved to the observation channel which contained buffer T and 5 mM Ca(OAc)2,
where the YOYO-1 dissociated from the DNA in less than one min. The YOYO-1 allowed
measurement of DNA length and verification that a single DNA molecule was captured. The
bead-λ DNA complex was then moved to the protein channel containing the fluorescent
RAD51 (using carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester coupling to the N-terminal amino group
at pH 7.0 (Galletto et al., 2006)) in buffer T containing 2 mM Ca(OAc)2 with 1 mM ATP and
GST-tagged BRC4, Δ1524-30, or BRCA2BRC1-8, at the concentrations specified. After each
incubation time, the protein-DNA-bead complex was moved back to the second channel for
direct observation.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The dissociation experiment was conducted by forming the RAD51 nucleoprotein filament in
the protein channel in buffer T containing 1 mM ATP, 2 mM Mg(OAc)2, and 250 nM RAD51.
After 4 min of incubation, the filament was moved to the observation channel in buffer T
containing 2 mM ATP and 10 mM Mg(OAc)2, with or without 1 μM GST-BRC4. The length
of the λ DNA was calculated from 11 molecules, corrected for the radius of the bead and for
extension due to the YOYO-1 dye. All the experiments were conducted using illumination
from a mercury lamp, and fluorescence was observed using a FITC filter (Chroma Technology
Corp., number 41001). Data were collected on S-VHS tapes, digitized, and analyzed with
Image J software and associated plug-ins.
DNA strand exchange assay
Reactions (20 μl) were as described (Bugreev and Mazin, 2004). RAD51 and GST-tagged
BRC4 or the control peptides Δ1524-30 and T1526A, at the concentrations indicated, were
incubated with ϕX174 ssDNA (15 μM, nt) for 5 min at 37 °C in buffer containing: 25 mM
TrisOAc, pH 7.5; 250 mM NaCl, 2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2. RPA
(1 μM) was then added, and incubation continued for 5 min at 37 °C. The reaction was started
by the addition of XhoI- linearized 32P-labelled ϕX174 duplex DNA (15 μM, nt). After 2 h at
37 °C, the samples were treated with Proteinase K (Roche) for 15 min at 37 °C. Products were

resolved by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel (1 × TAE) at 40 V over night. The gels were
dried and analyzed on a Molecular Dynamics Storm 840 PhosphorImager using ImageQuant
software. The amount of DNA strand exchange product at each BRC4 concentration was
calculated as a percentage of the joint molecules (JM) or nicked circular DNA (NC) products
relative to the total amount of DNA in the same lane.

and GST-T1526A on DNA strand exchange between ϕX174 circular ssDNA and linear dsDNA
promoted by RAD51 protein at 7.5 μM RAD51 (right panel); the uneven substrate bands
resulted from a drying artifact. The left panel shows DNA strand exchange products at the
optimal RAD51 concentration (3.75 μM). Size markers (kb) are shown in the left lane. (C)
Quantification of the joint molecules (red) and nicked circular dsDNA (black) products using
3.75 μM RAD51 (inverted triangles); 7.5 μM RAD51 and GST-BRC4 (filled circles); 7.5 μM
RAD51 and GST-Δ1524-30 (open circles); or 7.5 μM RAD51 and GST-T1526A (squares).

(A) The BRC repeats promote formation of the active ATP-RAD51-ssDNA filament at several
steps: (1) In the presence of Mg2+-ATP, the BRC repeats promote binding of RAD51 to ssDNA.
(2) By decreasing the rate of ATP hydrolysis, they permit accumulation of the active ATPbound form of the filament. (3) The BRC repeats also stabilize the ADP-RAD51-ssDNA
complex, permitting exchange of ADP for ATP and further increasing accumulation of an ATPbound nucleoprotein filament. This filament is the active species in DNA strand exchange.
(B) The BRC repeats prevent assembly of the non-productive ATP-RAD51-dsDNA filament:
(4) The BRC repeats block nucleation of RAD51 onto dsDNA. (C) Proposed function of the
intact BRCA2 protein in DSB repair (see text for details). A break in dsDNA is resected to
produce ssDNA. RPA binds to the ssDNA, hindering RAD51 filament assembly. BRCA2 binds
to the dsDNA-ssDNA junction, and loads RAD51 onto the ssDNA but blocks assembly onto
the dsDNA. RAD51 filament growth extends the BRCA2-stablized nucleus, to form an ATPbound nucleoprotein filament capable of homologous DNA pairing. Blue spheres represent a
RAD51 monomer, T represents ATP, and D represents ADP; RPA is in orange, BRCA2 is
brown, and the BRC repeats are represented in purple.
