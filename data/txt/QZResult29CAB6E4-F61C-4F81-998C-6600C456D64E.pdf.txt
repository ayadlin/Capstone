BACKGROUND. The prevalence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) increases
with age. Although chemoimmunotherapy (CIT) has dramatically improved
response rates in patients with CLL, some CIT regimens are not well tolerated by
many patients 70 years of age.
METHODS. Sixty-four previously untreated patients with CLL and serum creatinine <1.5 times the upper limit of normal who met National Cancer Institute
(NCI) 96-WG criteria for treatment received pentostatin (2 mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2), and rituximab (375 mg/m2). The authors measured performance status at study entry and used age, weight, and baseline creatinine to
calculate creatinine clearance (CrCl).

RESULTS. Eighteen of 64 (28%) patients were ages 70 years. Although individuals

no significant differences in the number of cycles administered or grade 3–4 hematologic, infectious, or other toxicities. No significant difference in overall
response rate, complete response rate, or progression-free survival were observed
between patients with CrCl  70 mL/min and those with CrCl < 70 mL/min.

CONCLUSIONS. In this clinical trial, the PCR regimen was well tolerated by older
patients and individuals with CrCl  70. The efficacy of PCR was not significantly
affected by age or renal function. These findings suggest PCR may be a good therapeutic option for older patients and those with modestly decreased renal function. Cancer 2007;109:2291–8.  2007 American Cancer Society.

he prevalence of chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases with
age.1–4 The median age at the time of diagnosis is 65 years to 70
years, and because most patients are observed for several years
before treatment, more than half of patients who require therapy
are older than 70 years of age.1–5 Accordingly, identification of effective treatment regimens that can be safely administered to older
patients is a critical need in chronic lymphocytic leukemia therapy.
Despite these facts, older patients are typically under-represented in
most clinical trials. The median age of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia accrued to first-line therapy trials is often 60

years of age,6–9 and many trials exclude patients
aged >65 years10,11 or 70 years9 because therapies
under development are thought to be too toxic for
older patients. Clinical trials also typically have strict
eligibility criteria, which mandate that only patients
with well preserved organ function can be enrolled,
further limiting application of these therapies to
older individuals. Because of these limitations, it is
often unclear whether treatment regimens shown to
be highly efficacious in phase 2 clinical trials can be
effectively and safely administered to unselected
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who are
often older and/or infirm.
The major advance in the treatment of chronic
lymphocytic leukemia over the last decade has been
the development of chemoimmunotherapy regimens
that combine purine nucleoside analogs and monoclonal antibodies. The fludarabine and rituximab
combination (FR)7,12 and the fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab combination (FCR)6 have been
the most widely tested and used chemoimmunotherapy regimens. In phase 2 trials, these approaches
achieved a response in >90% of patients.6,12 Notably,
the FCR regimen induced a complete response in
70% of patients and led to molecular complete
responses in some individuals.6 Perhaps most importantly, it appears these chemoimmunotherapy
approaches may prolong survival.13
Unfortunately, the toxicity of some chemoimmunotherapy regimens precludes their administration to
many older patients. The M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center (Houston, Tex) group has reported that the
FCR regimen is not well tolerated in individuals
70 years of age14 or those with b-2-microglobulin
(B2M) >4.0 mg/dL.6 Specifically, when administered
as a first-line therapy to patients 70 years of age,
75% of patients experienced grade 3–4 myelosuppression, 11% experienced grade 3–4 infection, and
fewer than half were able to complete the intended
6 cycles of induction.14 The investigators conclude
that, although efficacious, a high incidence of early
discontinuations of treatment due to hematological
and nonhematological toxicity limited clinical benefits of FCR for patients ages 70 years.14
Along with fludarabine, 2 other purine nucleoside analogs are widely used to treat lymphoid malignancies: 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2-CDA) and
pentostatin. Whereas all 3 purine nucleoside analogs
have demonstrated single-agent efficacy in chronic
lymphocytic leukemia,15–22 and both fludarabine and
2-CDA have demonstrated higher response rates
than alkylating agents in randomized trials,23–26 no
randomized controlled trials comparing these agents
have been reported to date. Based on indirect evi-

dence, some have suggested that pentostatin is better
tolerated and less myelosuppressive than fludarabine
when used in combination with cyclophosphamide
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients.27,28
We recently reported the results of a phase 2,
multicenter study of pentostatin, cyclophosphamide,
and rituximab (PCR) as first-line treatment for
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, which
demonstrated PCR is an efficacious therapy in this
disease.29 Because of the important issues detailed
above concerning whether chemoimmunotherapy
can be safely administered to older chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we examined how age, creatinine clearance (CrCl), b-2 microglobulin (B2M), and
performance status (PS) relate to the efficacy and tolerability of this pentostatin-based chemoimmunotherapy regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Characteristics
As recently reported, we treated 64 previously
untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients
meeting NCI 96 chronic lymphocytic leukemia Working Group criteria29 for treatment with pentostatin (2
mg/m2), cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2) and rituximab (375 mg/m2) for a planned duration of 6
cycles.30 All patients received hydration during and
after treatment with each dose of pentostatin. In
accord with NCI working group recommendations,
eligibility required an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0–3 and serum creatinine of 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (1.8 mg/dL for women and 2.1 mg/dL for
men).29 Patients were also required to have a total
bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 3
times the upper limit of normal at the treating institution. There was no age restriction on eligibility. We
measured ECOG PS at study entry and used age,
weight, and baseline creatinine to calculate the CrCl
of all patients at the time of study enrollment by
using the Cockroft-Gault equation.31 Toxicity was
graded by using the NCI Common Toxicity Criteria
(v.2)32 supplemented by the NCI chronic lymphocytic
leukemia Working Group guidelines for hematologic
toxicity.29 Response to treatment was classified
according to NCI Criteria.29 The 3 patients who had
no evidence of disease at completion of therapy but
who had residual cytopenia were considered ‘‘CR
with residual cytopenia’’ and were grouped with
complete response (CR) patients for this analysis.

formance status in this cohort as well as differences
in the various endpoints of interest between dichotomized groups. On the basis of cutpoints used in previous studies,14,33 patients who were aged 70 years or
older were classified as ‘‘older’’ chronic lymphocytic
leukemia patients. In addition, a cutpoint of 70 mL/min
was used for CrCl based on the use of this threshold
as an eligibility criterion for treatment in some
chronic lymphocytic leukemia chemoimmunotherapy trials.14 Patients were also dichotomized on the
basis of having a B2M level 4.0 mg/dL or >4.0
mg/dL based on previous reports that this cutpoint
predicts early discontinuation of FCR therapy.6 Quantitative comparisons in the various endpoints of interest were evaluated by using Fisher exact test for
categorical endpoints and Wilcoxon rank sum tests
for continuous endpoints. Because of the small number of patients in the performance status 2 or 3
groups, these patients were combined with the performance status 1 patients for analysis. Overall, comparisons were limited by the available sample sizes,
and sufficient power was available for detecting only
relatively large differences between groups. For
example, at least 80% power was available to detect
a 30% to 40% or greater difference (eg, 30% vs 70%;
10% vs. 40%) in response or toxicity incidence rates
between patients ages <70 (n ¼ 46) vs 70 years
(n ¼ 18). To detect a 20% difference in rates (eg, 5%
vs 25% or 75% vs 95%), we would have only 58%
power. Similarly, at least 80% power was available to
detect a >25% to 35% difference (eg, 30% vs 65%; 5%
vs 30%) in response or toxicity between patients with
CrCl  70 (n ¼ 38) vs CrCl <70 (n ¼ 24) as well as

we explored differences in progression-free survival
(PFS) between groups. Based on the sample size, we
had at least 80% to detect a hazard ratio of 3.

RESULTS
The cumulative patient characteristics, overall
response rate (ORR), and response according to
prognostic parameters (IgVH gene mutation status,
CD38, ZAP-70, cytogenetic abnormalities by fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH]) for the 64 patients
treated with PCR in this trial have been previously
reported.30 In the current evaluation, we first
assessed how age influenced the efficacy and tolerability of PCR therapy. Eighteen of 64 (28%) treated
patients were ages 70 years (range, 70–80 years).
Fourteen (78%) of the patients ages 70 completed
the intended 6 cycles of induction. Although individuals ages 70 years were more likely to have a dose
delay of >1 week at some point during the trial (28%
vs 7%; P ¼ .03), there was no difference in the median number of cycles administered, patients requiring dose reductions, or patients with grade 3–4
hematologic toxicity, infectious complications, or
other nonhematologic toxicity (Table 1). The rates of
any grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity was similar
among individuals ages 70 years and those aged
<70 years (61% vs 48%; P ¼ .41). Although grade 3–4
neutropenia was more common among individuals
ages 70 years (56% vs 35%; P ¼ .16), this difference
was not statistically significant, and no increase in

grade 3–4 infectious complications was observed (6%
vs 11%; P ¼ .67). No significant differences in overall
response (OR) (83% vs 93%; P ¼ .34) or complete
response rate (39% vs 41%; P ¼ .86) was observed
between patients ages 70 years compared with
those aged <70 years.
We next evaluated whether CrCl related to efficacy and tolerability of PCR. Twenty-five (39%)
patients had a CrCl < 70 mL/min (range, 34–67),
including 14 (22%) with a CrCl  60 mL/min and 4
(6%) with CrCl  50 mL/min. Although individuals
with CrCl < 70 mL/min were more likely to require a
dose reduction (24% vs 5%; P ¼ .05) at some point
during treatment, there was no difference in the median number of cycles administered, patients who
required a dose delay, or patients with nonhematologic toxicity based on renal function (Table 2). There
was more grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity in individuals with CrCl < 70 mL/min, although this difference was not statistically significant (64% vs 42%;
P ¼ .12). Additionally, a trend toward increased grade
3–4 neutropenia among patients with CrCl < 70
(56% vs 32%; P ¼ .07) was observed, although no
increase in grade 3–4 infectious complications was
apparent (8% vs 11%; P ¼ 1.0). Decreased renal function had no effect on OR (92% vs 89%; P ¼ 1.0) or
complete response rates (36% vs 45%; P ¼ .60).
We next evaluated the effect of performance status (PS) on efficacy and tolerability of PCR. Thirtyfour (53%) patients were PS ¼ 0, 24 (38%) were
PS ¼ 1, and 6 (9%) were PS ¼ 2 or 3. Because of the

low number of patients with PS ¼ 2–3 (n ¼ 6), we
compared the tolerability of PCR between those with
PS ¼ 0 and those with PS  1 (Table 3). Individuals
with PS  1 were more likely to require a dose reduction
(23% vs 3%; P ¼ .02) at some point during treatment.
Although more patients with PS  1 required a dose
delay of > 1 week at some point during treatment
(20% vs 6%; P ¼ .13), this difference was not statistically significant. Patients with PS  1 also experienced more grade 3–4 nonhematologic toxicity other
than infection (40% vs 15%; P ¼ .03) and had more
grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity (67% vs 38%; P ¼ .03)
because of a significantly greater incidence of grade
3–4 neutropenia (60% vs 24%; P ¼ .005). Despite
these trends, no significant differences in the median
number of cycles administered or the number of
patients with infectious complications were observed
among those with PS ¼ 0 compared with those with
PS  1. Performance status did not effect the OR
(94% vs 87%; P ¼ .41) or complete response rates
(47% vs 33%; P ¼ .31).
On the basis of reports that B2M influences the
tolerability of FCR,6 we next assessed how B2M influenced the efficacy and tolerability of PCR therapy.
B2M at the time of study entry was available for 61
of 64 (95%) patients. Thirty-one of these 61 (51%)
patients had a B2M  4.0 mg/dL and 30 (49%) had a
B2M > 4.0 mg/dL. Although individuals with a
B2M > 4.0 mg/dL were more likely to have a dose
delay of >1 week at some point during the trial (28%
vs 7%; P ¼ .03), there was no difference in the

required dose reductions or dose delays, or patients
with grade 3–4 nonhematologic toxicity (Table 4).
The rates of any grade 3–4 hematologic toxicity
appeared to be higher among patients with B2M
> 4.0 (63% vs 39%; P ¼ .07) primarily because of an
increased frequency of grade 3–4 neutropenia (53%
vs 26%; P ¼ .04). Despite this difference in grade 3–4
neutropenia, no increase in grade 3–4 infectious
complications was observed among patients with
B2M  4.0 (10% vs 6%; P ¼ .67). No significant differences in overall response (83% vs 97%; P ¼ 0.1) or
CR rate (37% vs 45%; P ¼ .61) were observed between
patients B2M > 4.0 compared with those B2M  4.0.

Finally, we evaluated how age, CrCl, performance
status, and B2M related to PFS after treatment with
PCR (median follow-up for living patients ¼ 33
months). No differences in PFS were noted for any of
these analyses (Figure 1A–D).

DISCUSSION
We have examined efficacy and tolerability of the
PCR regimen among patients ages 70 years and
those with modestly decreased CrCl. We found that
older patients tolerated PCR as well as younger
patients. Older patients were as likely as younger
patients to complete the intended 6 cycles of therapy

and to achieve complete or partial remission without
excess grade 3–4 toxicity. This appears to contrast
with the tolerability of the FCR regimen in older
patients.6,14 Additionally, within the restrictions of
the eligibility criterion (serum creatinine 1.5 times
the upper limit of normal range), CrCl did not dramatically influence the efficacy or tolerability of
the PCR regimen. This is notable given that nearly
40% of patients enrolled on this study had a CrCl <
70 mL/min, a characteristic that would exclude them
from participation in some ongoing phase 3 chemoimmunotherapy trials.33 Consistent with the concept that physiologic age is more important than
chronologic age, poorer performance status at the
time of enrollment did decrease tolerability; however,
it did not significantly affect the number of treatment cycles given or treatment efficacy.
Previously performed phase 2 studies suggest that
chemoimmunotherapy may improve both response
rates and survival for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia13 and phase 3 trials to validate this
approach are ongoing.33 Unfortunately, many patients
with chronic lymphocytic leukemia who require therapy are ages 70 years1–4 and appear to tolerate some
chemoimmunotherapy regimens less well than
younger patients.6,14 Older patients are also more
likely to have decreased renal function and other
comorbidities that can influence the ease of administration, tolerability, toxicity, and efficacy of therapy.
Additional barriers, such as more limited mobility
and/or dependence on others for transportation, also
make compliance with regimens that require frequent
office visits more difficult for such patients. Despite
these characteristics, many such patients will have a
prolonged life expectancy if successfully treated for
their chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
After the observation that patients ages 70
years tolerate some chemoimmunotherapy regimens
poorly, some clinicians have limited the use of chemoimmunotherapy to younger patients and have
employed ‘‘less-toxic therapies’’ such as chlorambucil, rituximab monotherapy, steroid-based treatments, or single-agent purine nucleoside analogs for
older patients.34–37 This approach sacrifices efficacy
for tolerability. Importantly, a lack of durable control
of the leukemia has potential to result in both diminished quality of life and length of life for many older
patients. A second approach is to allow older patients
to receive aggressive chemoimmunotherapy with
regimens such as FCR, provided they have well preserved renal function and good performance status.33
Although this strategy expands the number of
patients who can receive chemoimmunotherapy, it
still precludes treatment of many older individuals. A

third approach is to attempt to identify chemoimmunotherapy regimens that achieve both a high degree
of efficacy and that can be well tolerated by older
patients. The ideal treatment regimen for older
chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients would be one
that is highly efficacious, easy to administer, requires
few office visits, and has modest toxicity.
Our analysis suggests that the PCR regimen may
fulfill many of these criteria. The regimen appears to
be both quite effective and well tolerated by chronic
lymphocytic leukemia patients older than the age of
70 years as well as those with modestly reduced CrCl
or elevated B2M. Importantly, patients aged 70
years, as well as those with modestly reduced renal
function, increased B2M, or PS  1 were as likely to
complete the intended 6 cycles of induction and
achieve a response as those without these characteristics. Furthermore, no differences in progressionfree survival were observed based on any of these
characteristics, suggesting that clinical benefit of
PCR for these patients was also independent of these
features. Because the PCR regimen is administered
on Day 1 of every 3-week cycle, this regimen also
requires fewer office visits than other chemoimmunotherapy regimens (8 visits over 6-cycle period for
PCR compared with 19 visits for FCR6 and 30–34 visits for FR6,12), which may improve the ease of administration to older patients.
There are several reasons why older individuals
may tolerate the PCR regimen better than the FCR
regimen. First, pentostatin may be less myelosuppressive than fludarabine, resulting in a lower frequency of grade 3–4 neutropenia and better
tolerability.27,28 Second, we used a 2 mg/m2 dose of
pentostatin rather than the 4 mg/m2 dose used in
some other studies.27 The optimal dose of pentostatin for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia is
unknown, and it is uncertain whether increasing the
dose from 2 mg/m2 to 4 mg/m2 enhances efficacy
or simply increases toxicity. Third, the dose of pentostatin needed to achieve an equivalent effect to the
fludarabine dose in FCR is unknown. It is possible 1
dose of pentostatin at 2 mg/m2 every 3 weeks is not
equivalent to 3 doses of 25 mg/m2 of fludarabine every 4 weeks and that the enhanced tolerability is due
to a lower total purine nucleoside analog dose.
Finally, growth factor support was used routinely for
all patients treated in our trial of PCR,30 whereas it
was used at the treating physician’s discretion in the
published trial of FCR.6
Whereas the PCR regimen appears to be a significant step forward for older patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, there are some limitations to our
analyses. First, this was a phase 2 study with a rela-

2297

tively small number of patients. The study was not
statistically powered to detect small differences in efficacy and toxicity between the subgroups studied,
and these could be more apparent in future, larger
studies. Second, we used the calculated CrCl to estimate renal function. Although this is a standardized,
widely used approach and is the approach being used
to determine eligibility in ongoing phase 3 trials of
chemoimmunotherapy for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, it is not as accurate as the measured glomerular filtration rate as assessed by inulin or iothalamate
clearance.31 Third, our study does not provide data
on the use of PCR in patients with more severe renal
failure (creatinine > 1.5 3 upper limit normal) in
whom dose reductions for purine nucleoside analogs
are required for safe treatment. Fourth, although trial
eligibility criteria permitted enrollment of patients
with an ECOG PS 0–3, few study participants had a
PS  2, which limits our ability to analyze the tolerability of PCR in that patient subgroup. Finally,
although this trial was conducted at 2 medical centers that serve large local and regional patient populations, they are also tertiary referral centers which
could influence the applicability of these results to
community practice.
Nevertheless, the PCR regimen seems to be very
well tolerated among patients ages 70 years and
those with decreased renal function. There remains a
significant need for development of efficacious treatment regimens that can be tolerated by older
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Clinical
trials evaluating tolerability and the optimal duration
of therapy in addition to efficacy are needed for
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and
such trials should actively seek to enroll older
patients so that their results are applicable to the
majority of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients in
need of therapy worldwide.
