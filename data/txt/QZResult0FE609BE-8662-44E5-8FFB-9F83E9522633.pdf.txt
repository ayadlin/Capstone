BACKGROUND: This study sought to determine the feasibility and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the combination of cetuximab with chemoradiotherapy based on 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin (CP) in locally advanced anal canal carcinoma. METHODS:
Cetuximab was administered on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, 43, and 50 (400 mg/m2 initial dose, then 250 mg/m2/week) concurrent with
total dose radiation of 55 to 59 Gy, both starting on day 1. Escalating doses of 5-FU (96-hour infusion) and CP (2-hour infusion), both
on days 1 and 29, were administered according to the following design: starting dose level (0) 5-FU/CP 5 800/60 mg/m2/day and up
to dose level (12) 5-FU/CP 5 1000/80 mg/m2/day. RESULTS: Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) events (uncontrolled diarrhea or febrile
neutropenia) occurred in 3 of 14 assessable patients receiving escalated dose of 5-FU/CP, with 1 in dose level (0) and 2 in dose level
(12). The RP2D was 5-FU/CP 5 800/80 mg/m2/day. Because of unexpected non-DLT treatment-related grade 3 (G3) adverse events
(AEs) such as thrombosis/embolism, syncope, and infection occurring in  20% of patients, a safety expansion cohort with an additional 9 patients was investigated with the RP2D. The most frequent G3/G4 AEs evaluated in 23 patients were radiation dermatitis (12
patients), diarrhea (10 patients), thrombosis/embolism (6 patients), and infection (5 patients). The study was closed due to these
severe AEs, although no G5 AEs occurred. Twenty of 21 patients (95%) achieved pathological complete response at primary tumor.
With a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 3-year locoregional control rate was 64.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Cetuximab could not be
integrated with chemoradiotherapy-cisplatin-based therapy due to the high toxicity rate. However, efficacy is encouraging and further
investigation of an epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted agent (other than cetuximab) concurrent with chemoradiation should

INTRODUCTION
Over the last decade, several strategies to improve chemoradiotherapy (CRT) outcomes in anal carcinoma have included
the addition of induction or consolidation chemotherapy to the CRT backbone, radiotherapy (RT) dose escalation, and
the integration of different chemotherapy agents into the CRT backbone. Yet, data from randomized phase 3 trials have
demonstrated that none of those efforts have improved overall survival (OS) or disease-free survival (DFS) rates in this
population.1-3 Moreover, preliminary results of the Cancer Research United Kingdom Anal Cancer Trial (ACT II)
showed equivalency for chemoradiation cisplatin (CP)-based therapy compared with chemoradiation mitomycin-C-based
therapy in terms of DFS, with significantly less acute grade 3/grade 4 (G3/G4) hematological toxicity in favor of the CP
group.3
An emerging strategy in oncology is to incorporate newer, biologically active, targeted therapies into established
CRT schedules. One attractive target is the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a type I tyrosine kinase membrane
receptor that regulates key functions in epithelial malignancies.4 EGFR is often overexpressed and/or abnormally activated
in almost all squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), including anal carcinomas (in up to 90%).5
Cetuximab (Erbitux; Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany) is an immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody that specifically targets EGFR, competitively inhibiting ligand binding and ligand-dependent downstream signaling.6 Phase 1

clinical trials demonstrated the safety of cetuximab combined with CP7 and cetuximab combined with radiation
therapy8 in SCCs other than anal carcinoma. Also, in
phase 3 clinical trials, adding cetuximab to first-line
chemotherapy or RT improves outcomes in various types
of cancers.9-11
Because of encouraging results of clinical trials with
cetuximab in different tumors, the need for more effective
therapies, particularly in locally advanced anal canal carcinoma (LAACC),12 and the high expression of EGFR in
anal carcinoma, we set out to develop a regimen to evaluate the safety and activity of cetuximab combined with 5fluorouracil (5-FU)/CP concurrent with radiation for
LAACC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design and Statistics

This was an open-label, dose escalation, and single-center
phase 1 study. The primary objectives were to determine
the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) and safety of 5FU and CP in combination with cetuximab and concurrent RT in LAACC. Clinical activity was also assessed.
The study and its subsequent amendments were approved
by institutional review boards (IRBs) and National Ethics
Review Boards. Informed consent was obtained from all
patients. Descriptive statistics on patient characteristics,
analysis of toxicities, and outcomes were performed for all
patients.
Eligibility Criteria

Patients with pathologically confirmed SCC of the anal
canal were eligible if they were 18 to 70 years old, had a
Karnofsky performance score of at least 70%, had category T3 to T4 tumors or were node-positive (defined by
the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual13) and adequate renal,
hepatic, and bone marrow function. For patients presenting with palpable inguinal nodes felt to be clinically positive and/or with inguinal nodes on imagery, inguinal
node status was assessed by needle aspiration cytology or
biopsy confirmation. Enlarged inguinal, perirectal, or pelvic nodes on computed tomography (CT) scan,  1.0 cm
were considered to be clinically positive. Exclusion criteria
included T1 or M1 tumor, severe comorbidities (uncontrolled infection, psychiatric disorders, cardiovascular disease, collagenosis, and known human immunodeficiency
virus infection), or major malignancy (unless successfully
treated and disease-free for at least 5 years). Pregnancy or
women with childbearing potential who lacked effective
contraception were also excluded.
2974

Study Assessment and Follow-Up

Patient demographics and medical history were evaluated
before treatment. Adverse events (AEs), physical examination, digital rectal examination, vital signs, performance
status, hematology, clinical chemistry, and creatinine
clearance were measured before treatment and weekly during treatment. Toxicities were assessed using Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 3.0.
Imaging staging studies (chest, abdominal, and pelvic CT and pelvic magnetic resonance), rectosigmoidoscopy, electrocardiography, and echocardiography were
performed before treatment and 8 weeks after treatment.
Tumor specimens from pre- and posttreatment biopsies
were collected for molecular analysis according to the Brazilian National Tumor Bank guidelines. Assessment of
complete pathological response (pCR; defined asabsence
of carcinomatosus cells in the specimens analyzed) on primary tumor (pT0), and clinical response (CR) according
to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST), took place at the eighth week after treatment.
Afterward, follow-up visits were performed every 3
months for 2 years, and annually thereafter. Locoregional
control (LRC) was defined as the time from day 1 of treatment to either disease recurrence in the anus and/or inguinal or pelvic lymph node, or death from any cause other
than distant metastasis.
Study Treatment

Standard cetuximab dose combined with escalated doses
of 5-FU/CP concurrent with moderate dose of RT were
investigated (Fig. 1).
Chemotherapy

Intravenous administration of 5-FU (96-hour infusion)
and CP (2-hour infusion) were administered intravenously on days 1 and 29 preceding cetuximab infusion.
Four dose-level escalations were planned (Table 1) in consecutive cohorts of 3 patients, with expansion to 6 patients
if 1 of the 3 initial patients experienced a dose-limiting
toxicity (DLT). If 2 or more of 6 patients exhibited DLT
at the “starting dose” level (0), then dose level (21) would
be the recommended dose to be tested. Up to 6 patients
would be treated at this dose level to ensure information
on the safety profile at that dose is complete. If 2 patients
presented DLT at dose level (21), the study should be
stopped. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was
defined at the dose level (11) or dose level (12), if 2 of 3
or 2 of 6 patients developed DLT. The immediate dose
level below the MTD was considered the RP2D. Doses
were escalated to the next cohort after 12 weeks (8 weeks

and 2 opposite fields. Fourteen patients were positioned
in dorsal decubit, and the posterior field was smaller to
protect femoral heads in cases in which it was possible, after a planning CT scan proved that an anterior field was
able to cover all inguinal nodes. Three-dimensional conformal RT was used in 9 patients, with delineation of target and organs at risk, based on the Radiation Therapy
Oncology Group atlas. Delineation of lymph nodes
included common iliac, internal and external iliac, and inguinal chair, and margin around the tumor also received
RT. These patients received field-in-field treatment.

of 10 to 14 Gy in 2-Gy fractions (total dose of 55-59 Gy

patients at the same decubit of the first phase or a direct
photon or electron perineal field, with patient in lithotomy position, in cases that tumor was preferentially of
margin. For node-positive patients, an anterior electron
beam was performed to the inguinal affected region, using
the most appropriate energy. In patients who received
conformal treatment, 3 fields were used. There were no
planned modifications of RT dose for toxicity, but treatment breaks were permitted.

Cetuximab

Starting on day 1 of RT, patients received weekly intravenous cetuximab (400 mg/m2 during 120-minute infusion
on day 1 and 250 mg/m2 during 60-minute infusion on
days 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 42, and 50) at least 2 hours before
radiation.
For dose modifications, if neutrophil counts were< 1000/mm3 and/or platelets were < 50,000/mm3, 5FU/CP dose was reduced by 50%. If serum creatinine
value was between 1.5 and 2.0 mg/mL, with G2 peripheral neuropathy and G2 ototoxicity, CP dose was
decreased by 50%. The next course of CP was not administered if these toxicities reached G3.
The dose of 5-FU was decreased by 50% if G3 diarrhea or stomatitis occurred. Options for cetuximab G3
skin toxicity included a 1-week delay, with dose reductions in increments of 50 mg/m2 (minimum cetuximab
dose of 150 mg/m2), or a 2-week delay without a dose
reduction. A patient was excluded from the study in case
of cetuximab G4 skin toxicity.

ological evaluation, and another patient was considered
stage IV after comparative analysis of CT scans before and
after treatment
Dose Escalation and DLTs

Seven patients were treated at the dose level 0 (5-FU/
CP 5 800/60 mg/m2). One of the initial 3 patients in this
first cohort experienced a DLT (G4 diarrhea and febrile
neutropenia). Four additional patients were included in
this cohort, and none among them experienced DLT.
The addition of 1 extra patient was necessary due to consent withdrawn from 1 patient for cetuximab administration during boost radiation. In addition to DLT, this dose
was associated with G3 diarrhea in another 3 patients and
mandatory use of loperamide, ciprofloxacin therapy, and
outpatient hydration, to minimize the severity of the diarrhea, was established through a protocol amendment. In
the next dose level (11), no additional DLTs occurred. At
level (12), 2 of the 4 patients developed DLTs (uncontrolled diarrhea and febrile neutropenia). Therefore, the
dose of level (11) was selected as the RP2D.

Patient Characteristics

The study reached its MTD and RP2D goals after the
accrual of 14 patients between August 2006 and November 2008. However, exacerbation of non-DLT G3 events
such as diarrhea and infections and occurrence of G3
unexpected deep venous thrombosis and G3syncope AEs
in  20% of patients led the investigators and IRB to recommend the use of RP2D in a safety expansion cohort of
an additional 9 patients before proceeding to the phase 2
trial. The accrual was restarted on November 2009 until
November 2011.
Patient characteristics are summarized in Table 2.
All patients (n 5 23) were included for toxicity analyses,
and 21 were evaluated for clinical and pathological
responses. One patient was found to have an ineligible histologic analysis (adenocarcinoma) on posttreatment path2976

Toxicities and Treatment Delivered

Toxicities of G3 or G4 for all 23 patients (14 initial
patients plus 9 patients from the expansion cohort) enrolled in this phase 1 study are listed in Table 3. Common
G3/G4 toxicities occurring in  2 patients at least once
were: in-field radiation dermatitis (52%), diarrhea
(43.5%), thrombosis/embolism (26%), infection
(21.4%), neutropenia (17.4%), dehydration and metabolic abnormalities (17.4%), and decreased performance
status (17.4%). The thrombosis/embolism AEs were the
only G4 toxicities reported by more than 2 patients
(13%). No treatment-related deaths occurred.
In-field radiation dermatitis is a typical skin toxicity
within the radiation portal with concurrent chemoradiation. Only one G4 (4.3%) in-field radiation dermatitis

was reported, and 11 patients (47.8%) developed G3 toxicity. However, some acute G3/G4 AEs were exacerbated
beyond those expected with definitive concurrent chemoradiation such as diarrhea in 10 patients (43%), thrombosis/embolism in 6 patients (26%), and infection 5 patients
(21%). Hospitalization was necessary for recovery of these
G3/G4 AEs in all patients with infection and half of
patients with diarrhea and thrombosis/embolism. Three
additional patients required hospitalization, including 1
with pancreatitis related to cetuximab, 1 to perform colostomy due to vaginal fistulae, and another to improve performance status and analgesia. The last dose of 5-FU was
suspended in 1 patient (due to G4 radiodermatitis) and
was decreased by 50% in 2 patients (due to G3 diarrhea);
all 3 of these patients were treated with the RP2D.
All patients started weekly cetuximab concurrent
with CRT. The median number of cetuximab doses
administered was 7 (range, 2-8 doses). Five patients
received fewer than 6 doses of cetuximab. In 2 patients,
cetuximab was discontinued due to DLTs (G4 diarrhea
and G3 diarrhea plus G3 infection) after the fifth dose of
treatment. In 2 patients, cetuximab was discontinued after
the third dose due to G3 hypersensibility reaction and G3
pancreatitis. In another patient, 4 doses of cetuximab
were omitted due to G4 thrombosis/embolism. The average dose intensity for cetuximab, 5-FU, and CP were
85%, 95%, and 99%, respectively.
Twenty-two patients completed the full preplanned
55- to 59-Gy course of RT (one patient received 45 Gy
due to G3/G4 neutropenia toxicity). The median
Cancer

duration of total RT was 64 days. Only 2 patients finished
RT at prescribed protocol dose in the preplanned time,
and RT interruptions were often necessary due to treatment-related toxicities, and occurred in approximately
65% of the patients. RT interruptions took place after the
second cycle of chemotherapy and the majority of patients
(73%) had received at least 34 Gy of pelvic irradiation.
Events Leading to Early Study Closure

This study was closed before moving to phase 2 due to
toxicity concerns, in particular, 6 thrombosis/embolism
events attributed to treatment. Early in the study, 3
patients developed jugular and subclavian G3 venous
thrombosis, where peripheral inserted central catheters
(PICCs) were placed. Although none of them suffered
embolic events, they had their catheter removed because
of subsequent G3 infection or febrile neutropenia.
The investigators, sponsor, and the IRB carefully
reviewed these 3 G3 AEs and considered their potential
relationship to the investigational drug and the possible
toxicity as a result of contribution of other events (diarrhea, infection, hospitalization, and PICCs). The decision
was to continue study accrual with replacement of the
PICC for totally implanted central venous access device
and particular vigilance for further significant toxicity.
Ultimately, during the expansion cohort, a series of
3 nonfatal but significant G4 thrombosis/embolism AEs
occurred in short succession, prompting study closure as a
result of patient safety concerns. Patients 24 and 26 developed left cervical and superior and left limb edema

followed by pulmonary embolism after receiving the second and sixth dose of cetuximab, respectively. Hospitalization was necessary for anticoagulation and line removal,
and both patients had recovered uneventfully. Finally,
patient 29, a 56-year-old woman, developed thoracic pain
and dyspnea 12 days after hospital discharge for treatment
of G4 febrile neutropenia and G4 diarrhea. Imaging angiography/CT scan revealed thrombosis sequelae due to significant luminal reduction of superior vena cava.
Efficacy Assessment

Of the 21 patients assessable for clinical response, 20 had
major responses (9 complete responses [CRs] and 11 partial responses [PRs]), yielding a response rate of 95%
(95% confidence interval [CI] 5 78%-99%).
Twenty of 21 patients (95%) achieved pCR at primary tumor (pT0). Tumor was not locally controlled in 6
cases (2 CRs, 3 PRs, and 1 stable disease). Among these 6
patients, 4 have been continuously disease-free from their
anal cancer after undergoing abdominal perineal resection, with follow-up times ranging from 13.8 to 41.3
months; 2 patients died, both with locoregional disease
and distant metastasis at 18 months and 42 months. With
a median follow-up of 43.4 months, the 3-year LRC was
64.2%; 95% CI 5 57.15%-70.40%.
DISCUSSION
Here, we report that the integration of cetuximab to
CRT-cisplatin-based treatment in LAACC was not feasible in our study due to the high rate of toxicity. Analysis
of toxicity profile of all 23 patients accrued in this study
demonstrated that G3/G4 rates of diarrhea and infection
seem to be twice as frequent than those rates experienced
in other anal cancer trials (21%-31%).1,14 In general,
treatment-related toxicities in this trial were associated
with interruption of RT in 15 patients (65%), hospitalization in 12 (52%), and omission of more than 2 cetuximab
doses in 5 individuals (17.4%). The contribution of a synergistic effect of cetuximab on these toxicities is possible.
In line with that, a meta-analysis of randomized trials
comparing cetuximab-based therapy versus non-cetuximab-based therapy demonstrated an increase of G3/G4
infection and diarrhea rates upon use of cetuximab.15
More recently, the French multicenter phase 2
ACCORD16 trial that explored CP-based CRT combined with cetuximab was stopped after accruing 16
patients with LAACC due to a high rate of toxicity and an
insufficient efficacy.16 Severe toxicity rates such as diarrhea (6 patients), fatigue (6 patients), neutropenia (5
patients), hyponatremia or hypokalemia (4 patients) were
2978

very similar to our findings, except for a high rate of lymphopenia (8 patients) found in the ACCORD16 trial.
Conversely, a phase 2 study—the Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) E3205—had recruited 28
patients to receive 2 cycles of neoadjuvant CP/5-FU alone
prior to cetuximab/CP/5-FU/RT. Expedited reporting
was required for type I (any G5, or G4 cardiac) or type II
(G4 RT skin, diarrhea) adverse events, with prespecified
rates of > 5% or > 20%, respectively, defined as unacceptable. Preliminary safety and efficacy data appear
encouraging with adverse type I 5 4% and type II 5 4%,
and a locoregional failure rate at 2 years of 13%.17
In addition, a phase 1 study of cetuximab with pelvic
CRT in cervical cancer also found excessive toxicities.18
Taken together with the anal carcinoma data, there are
now up to 2 clinical trials for which preliminary results
show that cetuximab combined with pelvic CRT in SCC
generates limiting toxicity.
In our study, an unexpected occurrence of 6 significant G3/G4 thrombosis/embolism events led to early
study closure. The possible mechanism that links cetuximab and venous thromboembolism (VTE) events may be
related to its antiangiogenic effect.19,20 Recently, a metaanalysis of 11 randomized clinical trials (7611 patients)
was conducted to better evaluate the potential risk for
VTE associated with anti-EGFR agents. The incidence of
VTE for the cetuximab arm was 5.7% compared with
3.9% for the control arm, a difference that was statistically
significant (P 5 .010).21 Although, cetuximab ultimately
retains antiangiogenic properties, inhibition of angiogenesis is probably not the only mechanism at work; even
regarding a specific vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor such as bevacizumab, there is uncertainty of its
role in VTE development.22
Cisplatin is an endothelium-damaging agent and its
direct role in thromboembolic toxicity has been suggested
by a large retrospective analysis of 932 patients treated
with CP-based chemotherapy for any type of malignancy;
169 patients (18%) developed thromboembolic events
with this type of chemotherapy.23
It is remarkable that all patients (n 5 6) in our phase
1 trial developed symptomatic deep venous thromboses in
the upper extremities where a central venous catheter was
placed, which in 3 cases was complicated by pulmonary
embolism. In addition, hospitalizations were necessary in
half of patients for treatment of other severe toxicities previous to thrombosis events, and 2 of them were due to febrile neutropenia, which is known factor that increased
VTE incidence even in the low-risk subgroup.24 We had a
constellation of risk factor for VTE involved in these

patients that could explain the high incidence. However,
no clear conclusion may be drawn on possible additive or
synergistic effects between cetuximab and CRT on the
high incidence of thrombosis/embolism. It should be
highlighted, though, that no thrombosis/embolism was
seen in the ACCORD16 trial, which is at odds with our
observations.
Despite the DLT observed in this study, the preliminary LRC rates are encouraging in LAACC. With a median follow-up time of 43.8 months, the 3-year LRC rate
was 64.2%, which is superior to the historical experience
at our institution for a predominantly LAACC population receiving CRT-CP-based treatment.14 LRC rates
also compare favorably with data reported in the major
randomized trial supporting concurrent CRT.3
Some may argue that our median duration of radiation treatment of 64 days was too long, and it would be
expected to show a reduction in the local control rate,
which contradicts the results. One possible explanation
might arise from additive effects of the weekly intravenous
schedule of cetuximab in combination with daily RT,
which may mean an enhanced cell destruction over all 30
to 35 fractions due to cetuximab clearance. These effects
may explain the pCR rate of 95% on primary tumor
(pT0) and predict for locoregional outcome.
To pursue further development of phase 1 and 2
clinical trials with addition of anti-EGFR agents to CRT
in LAACC, is advisable to categorize the patients according to VTE risk models and well-defined early stopping
rules.25 Also, cetuximab’s synergistic effect on diarrhea
and infection/febrile neutropenia proves to be a problem
of overlapping toxicity with pelvic chemoradiation.16,18
These acute toxicities may be reduced by the use of other
EGFR-targeted agents26 and mainly with the utilization
of intensity-modulated RT.27
At present, cetuximab should not be integrated with
5-FU/CP concurrent with RT in cases of LAACC due to
the high rate of toxicity, particularly an unacceptable VTE
incidence rate of 26%. However, efficacy is encouraging,
and further investigation of an EGFR-targeted agent
(other than cetuximab) concurrent with chemoradiation
should be pursued.
