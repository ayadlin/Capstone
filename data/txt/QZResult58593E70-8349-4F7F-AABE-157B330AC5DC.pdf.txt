BACKGROUND: The use of docetaxel prolongs survival for patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).
Inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with bevacizumab may further enhance the antitumor effect
of docetaxel and estramustine in patients with CRPC. METHODS: This cooperative group trial enrolled men with
CRPC. Patients received oral estramustine 280 mg 3 times daily on Days 1 through 5 of every cycle plus 70 mg/m2
docetaxel and 15 mg/kg bevacizumab on Day 2 every 3 weeks. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) values were monitored every cycle, and imaging studies were obtained every 3 cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary objectives were safety, PSA decline, measurable disease response, and overall
survival. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were enrolled; and 77 patients received a median of 8 cycles and were
evaluable. A 50% PSA decline was observed in 58 patients (75%). Twenty-three of 39 patients with measurable disease had a partial response (59%). The median PFS was 8 months, and the overall median survival was 24 months.
Neutropenia without fever (69%), fatigue (25%), and thrombosis/emboli (9%) were the most common severe toxicities. Twenty-four of 77 patients were removed from protocol treatment because of disease progression, 35 of 77
patients were removed because of a physician or patient decision, and 15 patients were removed secondary to toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of docetaxel, estramustine, and bevacizumab was tolerable but complicated by
toxicity. Although the endpoint of PFS did not meet the desired level, encouraging antitumor activity and overall
survival were observed. Further phase 3 evaluation of the role of bevacizumab in CRPC is ongoing. Cancer

palliative therapy; however, the introduction of docetaxelbased therapies has led to improved survival. The use of
docetaxel has exhibited a survival advantage over mitoxantrone and has become standard treatment for patients
with CRPC.2,3 However, the overall survival advantage of
2.9 months is modest, and further therapies that improve
the survival of patients who receive docetaxel-based therapies are needed.4
Before the completion of the phase 3 trials of docetaxel versus mitoxantrone, the Cancer and Leukemia
Group B (CALGB) developed a series of sequential studies to evaluate the addition of novel agents to the docetaxel
backbone. The addition of carboplatin was tolerated but
increased the myelosuppression of the regimen without
any clear signal of increased activity.5 Exisulind, which
investigators believed would induce apoptosis in malignant cells, also was combined with docetaxel and estramustine,6 but significant morbidity was associated with
that combination without a substantial improvement in
efficacy.
Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a glycoprotein that is important in promoting tumor angiogenesis7,8 and plays a critical role in the progression of
human prostate cancer. The fms-like tyrosine kinase/kinase insert domain receptor (Flk-1/KDR) receptors are
expressed in human prostate cancers and are correlated
with higher grade lesions and outcome.9 Expression of
VEGF is observed in prostate tumors and in plasma and
urine from patients with metastatic disease, and increasing VEGF expression is correlated with disease progression.10,11 Studies have demonstrated that plasma and
urine VEGF levels in patients with CRPC are independent predictors of survival.12,13 Therefore, we believed
that bevacizumab, a humanized murine monoclonal
antibody that neutralizes VEGF activity, would be a reasonable therapeutic approach for the treatment of
advanced prostate cancer. In a single-center study with
bevacizumab administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2
weeks to 15 patients with CRPC, bevacizumab was well
tolerated. However, as expected with this class of agents,
minimal evidence of activity was observed with monotherapy.14 Evolving data in other cancers suggested that
the overall benefit of VEGF blockade is more apparent
when bevacizumab is combined with a cytotoxic agent.
On the basis of the compelling in vivo data, the established importance of circulating VEGF levels in CRPC,
and the safety of bevacizumab, we conducted a multiinstitutional trial of combined docetaxel, estramustine,
and bevacizumab.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
This study was approved by the Executive Committee of
the CALGB and by the institutional review board at each
participating site. All patients provided written, informed
consent. All patients were required to have evidence of metastatic prostate cancer despite castrate levels of testosterone
(50 ng/mL). Patients also were required to have evidence
of progressive metastatic disease with documented, measurable disease progression on cross-sectional imaging, new
lesions on a bone scan, or 2 sequential rises in PSA with a
baseline PSA >5 ng/mL. Antiandrogens and megestrol acetate had to be discontinued for at least 4 weeks before registration, and patients were required to have evidence of
progression noted after those agents were discontinued. All
patients were required to continue receiving a luteinizing
hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist if they had
not undergone orchiectomy. Patients were not allowed to
have received prior cytotoxic therapy or other antiangiogenesis agents, including thalidomide. Patients may have
undergone major surgery or received radiation therapy only
if it was at least 4 weeks before study entry and may have
received radionuclide therapy only if it was at least 8 weeks
before study entry. All patients had to have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status
2; no significant peripheral neuropathy; and no prior
myocardial infarction, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary
embolus, or other major thromboembolic event within 1
year of entry. Patients who required full-dose anticoagulation also were excluded. Patients were required to have a
granulocyte count >1500/lL, a platelet count >100,000/
lL, a creatinine level <1.5 times the upper limit of normal
(ULN), a bilirubin level less than the ULN, an aspartate
aminotransferase level <1.5 times the ULN, and a dipstick
urinalysis 1þ protein. Patients who had received stable
bisphosphonate therapy for at least 4 weeks before entry
were allowed to continue, but initiation of bisphosphonate
therapy was not allowed.

Treatment and Evaluation
Therapy was based on 21-day cycles. Patients received
estramustine phosphate (Emcyt; Pharmacia Oncology,
Peapack, NJ) 280 mg 3 times daily on Days 1 through 5,
decadron 8 mg twice daily on Days 1 through 3, docetaxel
(Taxotere; Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) 70 mg/m2
on Day 2 intravenously over 1 hour, and bevacizumab
(supplied by Genentech Inc., South San Francisco, Calif;
distributed by the National Cancer Institute, Bethesda,

Md) 15 mg/kg administered intravenously after docetaxel
on Day 2. The first infusion of bevacizumab was administered over 90 minutes, the second infusion was administered over 60 minutes, and the third and subsequent doses
were administered over 30 minutes if the drug was well
tolerated. The bevacizumab dose was 5 mg/kg weekly,
consistent with most other malignancies, and it was given
every 3 weeks in coordination with chemotherapy administration. Warfarin 2 mg daily was encouraged but not
mandated as prophylaxis for thrombosis from estramustine unless a contraindication existed. Hematologic
growth factors were allowed according to American Society of Clinical guidelines, but prophylactic use was not
allowed.
Patients were evaluated every cycle for PSA levels and
every third cycle with bone scans and computed tomography scans of the abdomen and pelvis. Patients were encouraged to have their blood pressure monitored weekly, and
weekly blood counts were required. Liver function tests,
including bilirubin, transaminase levels, and alkaline phosphatase levels, along with urinalyses were required before
the administration of chemotherapy at each cycle.
The therapy was withheld for an absolute neutrophil
count <1500/lL, for a platelet count <100,000/lL (with
a dose reduction to 75% of the starting docetaxel dose upon
recovery), or for any episode of febrile neutropenia. For
aspartate aminotransferase elevations >1.5 times the ULN,
the dose of docetaxel was reduced to 60 mg/m2; and, for
bilirubin levels >1.5 times the ULN or aspartate aminotransferase levels >5 times the ULN, the docetaxel dose was
withheld. When the docetaxel dose was withheld, the estramustine and bevacizumab doses also were withheld. For
grade 2 neurotoxicity, the estramustine was reduced by
50%, and it was withheld for grade 3 toxicity. For grade 3
neurotoxicity, the docetaxel dose was reduced to 75%. For
persistent grade 3 neurotoxicity, the docetaxel was withheld. If chemotherapy was withheld for >3 weeks, then
the patient was removed from protocol treatment. For
thromboembolic events, once anticoagulated, patients were
allowed to continue on protocol with discontinuation of
bevacizumab and estramustine. For proteinuria >2þ on a
dipstick urinalysis, a 24-hour urine protein measurement
was required; and, if the protein level was >2000 mg daily,
then bevacizumab was withheld.
Disease progression and response were based on PSA
Working Group Consensus Criteria,15 and the Response
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) were used
to evaluate patients who had measurable disease. Bone scan
progression was defined as any new lesions.

Statistical Design and Data Analysis
The primary endpoint of this study was time to progression. PFS was defined as the interval between treatment
initiation and the date of progression or death, whichever
occurred first. Sample size computation was based on the
primary endpoint. The null hypothesis was that the
median time to progression would 11 months, and the
alternative hypothesis was that the median time to progression would be 16 months (a 45% increase). The target sample size was 79 patients assuming an ineligibility
rate of 10%. The normal approximation to the exact exponential test was used for sample size computation, and
the following assumptions were made: 1) a type I error
rate of .05, 2) power ¼ 89% (type II error rate ¼ 11%), 3)
an accrual rate of 4 patients per month over a 18-month
accrual period, 4) a 24-month follow-up period, and 5)
the time to progression would follow an exponential distribution. Under the alternative hypothesis, 55 progression events were expected at the end of the trial.
Toxicity was an important secondary endpoint, with
a hypothesized null hypothesis that the acceptable toxicity
probability was .80 versus the alternative hypothesis
that the acceptable toxicity probability was .90. Unacceptable toxicity was defined as death, grade 4 febrile
neutropenia, or any serious grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity,
excluding nausea, vomiting, alopecia, or hypersensitivity.
For the purpose of this study, ‘‘serious’’ toxicity was
defined as cardiac toxicity, thrombosis/embolism, or central nervous system hemorrhage/bleeding. Toxicity was
monitored using a 3-stage design after 15 patients, 35
patients, and 72 patients were enrolled and received 1 full
cycle of therapy. This design had a type I error rate of .10
and a power of 89% based on binomial simulations. The
decision rules for the continuation of accrual required that
at least 11 of 15 patients, at least 27 of 35 patients, and at
least 62 of 72 did not experience unacceptable toxicity.
Other endpoints that we considered were PSA PFS,
overall survival, the duration of objective response, and
the duration of PSA decline. PFS was defined as the interval between treatment initiation and the date of any disease progression (bone, PSA PFS, soft tissue), or clinical
deterioration, or death, whichever occurred first. PSA PFS
was defined as the time to first biochemical progression
using the PSA consensus criteria or death, whichever
occurred first. Overall survival was defined as the interval
between treatment initiation and the date of death. The
duration of response was calculated from the date of the
first complete or partial response to the date that the
patient had disease progression. The duration of PSA

response was defined as the interval between the date of
the first 50% PSA decline to the date when the patient
met the criteria for disease progression. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the objective response rate was
computed based on the binomial distribution. Overall
survival, objective PFS, PSA PFS, and PFS distributions
were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit
method.16
Members of the Audit Committee visit all participating institutions at least once every 3 years to review
source documents as part of the quality-assurance program of the CALGB. The auditors verify compliance with
federal regulations and protocol requirements in a sample
of protocols at each institution. On-site review of medical
records was done on a subgroup of 39 patients of the 79
patients (49%) in the current study. Patient registration
and data collection were managed by the CALGB Statistical Center. Data quality assurance included a careful
review of data by CALGB Statistical Center staff and by
the study chairperson. CALGB statisticians performed all
statistical analyses.

Patient Characteristics
Seventy-nine patients were enrolled between October
2001 and November 2002, and 77 of those patients were
eligible and assessable for treatment outcome (1 patient
did not meet eligibility criteria, and 1 patient was registered but never received therapy). The median patient age
was 69, and the median PSA level at enrollment was 123
ng/mL (range, 0.1-2231 ng/mL) (Table 1). The median
time since diagnosis was 4 years (overall range, of 0-17
years). Eighty-six percent of the patients had bone disease,
and 19% had visceral involvement. Overall, 51% of
patients had measurable disease according to RECIST.

sume protocol therapy but could restart docetaxel-based
therapies with the agreement of their physicians. Data
detailing subsequent treatments were not collected
prospectively.
Dose reductions in 1 or more of the 3 drugs in 1 or
more cycles occurred in 37 of 77 patients (48%). The
common reasons for dose reductions included hematologic toxicity (12%), gastrointestinal toxicity (6%), central nervous system toxicity (5%), and other (27%), such
as fatigue and depression. Some patients had more than 1
simultaneous requirement for dose reduction.

Study Treatment
The median number of cycles of therapy administered
was 8 (range, 1-30 cycles of therapy). Of 77 evaluable
patients, 24 patients (31%) came off therapy because of
disease progression, 15 patients (19%) stopped because of
protocol-defined toxicity, and 35 patients (45%) because
of a physician or patient decision but were not required by
the protocol to stop. Three patients (4%) died during
therapy. Patients who stopped therapy based on a physician or patient decision (n ¼ 35) did not have protocoldefined disease progression but opted for a ‘‘treatment
break.’’ After such a break, patients were not allowed to re-

Clinical Outcomes
Fifty-eight of 77 patients (75%; 95%CI, 64%-84%)
had a >50% post-therapy decline in PSA that was confirmed at least 1 month later. A waterfall plot of the PSA
decline at 12 weeks after the start of therapy is provided in
Figure 1.
The median time to PSA response was 1.4 months,
the median time to PSA progression was 9.2 months
(95%CI, 7.5-10.9 months), and the median duration of
PSA decline was 8.5 months (95%CI, 6.1-9.8 months).
Twenty-three of 39 men with measurable disease (59%;

RECIST criteria, and the median response duration in
measurable disease was 21.5 months (95%CI, 14.6-26.7
months).
The median time to any progression for patients was
8 months (95%CI, 5.9-9.5 months). Patients with measurable disease had a median time to measurable disease
progression of 16.5 months (95%CI, 10.9-23.2 months).
Seventy-five patients died. Sixty-eight of those patients
(90.7%) died of prostate cancer, and the median followup for surviving patients at the time of the current report
was 69 months. The median overall survival was 24
months (95%CI, 20.3-26.5 months) (Fig. 2).
Adverse Events
Table 2 presents the adverse events that probably, possibly, and definitely were related to treatment. Three
patients died on study. One patient died of an infection
without neutropenia, 1 patient who died had a mesenteric
vein thrombosis, and the other patient who died had a
bowel perforation that was complicated by severe metabolic acidosis. Grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and neutropenia
occurred in 53% and 62% of patients, respectively; however, febrile neutropenia occurred in only 3 patients (4%).
Overall, severe (grade 3-5) febrile neutropenia and infections with and without neutropenia were observed in 17
patients (22%).
Fatigue was common, and 25% of patients had
severe grade 3 or 4 fatigue, which required a dose reduction in 4 patients, delayed therapy in 2 patients, and
resulted in discontinuing therapy in at least 6 patients.
The median onset of the severe fatigue occurred at 7
cycles. Seven patients (9%) had thromboembolic complications, 4 patients (5%) developed deep venous thrombo-

sis, and 3 patients (4%) had pulmonary emboli, which
resulted in the death of 1 patient. One patient had a grade
4 cerebral hemorrhage in the left parietal lobe associated
with mild aphasia and partially recovered. Two patients
had grade 3 or 4 cerebral vascular accidents, and 1 was
associated with grade 3 hyponatremia with resolution of
mental status changes after treatment.
Low-grade epistaxis occurred in 42% of patients, 1
patient had grade 3 epistaxis, and 2 patients had self-limited grade 3 gastrointestinal bleeds. Mild hypertension
(grade 1 and 2) was observed in 11% of patients, and
more severe (grade 3 or 4) hypertension was observed in
5% of patients without serious complications. Low-grade
proteinuria was observed in 20% of patients, but grade 3
or 4 proteinuria was observed in only 1 patient after 22
cycles of therapy and improved after that patient discontinued bevacizumab.

DISCUSSION
The addition of bevacizumab to standard chemotherapy
has significantly improved the survival of patients with colon cancer, and data suggests that bevacizumab may play a
similar role in patients with CRPC. To further extend the
regimen of docetaxel and estramustine that was tested by
the CALGB,17 bevacizumab was added to evaluate the
safety and clinical activity of this combination. Although
studies now suggest that the addition of estramustine may
add little clinical benefit to docetaxel, the current study

was designed and implemented before the release of those
data.2,3
The combination of estramustine, docetaxel, and
bevacizumab had encouraging antitumor activity: Seventy-five percent of patients in the current study had
PSA declines 50% after therapy, and 59% of patients
with measurable disease achieved a complete or partial
response. These are very favorable results compared
with the results observed in many docetaxel-based trials
(Table 3). Nevertheless, PFS, which was our primary
endpoint, was 8.1 months and did not meet the specified study endpoint of 11 months. However, the 11-

month PFS was an ambitious goal, and evolving information now calls into question whether PFS is an
adequate endpoint in a nonrandomized study.18 In
addition, it should be noted that most of our patients
who came off therapy stopped not for progression but
because of the need for a break from treatment, which
would shorten an endpoint like PFS. Similarly, overall
survival in a nonrandomized study is difficult to interpret. However, the median survival of 24 months
(95%CI, 20.3-26.5 months) that was observed in our
patients surpassed the survival that was observed from
sequential clinical trials in a similar population by the

CALGB in which carboplatin or exisulind was added to
the docetaxel and estramustine backbone.5,6
Bevacizumab can be added to the docetaxel and
estramustine backbone safely but is associated with some
increase in toxicity. Neutropenia was observed in 69% of
our patients, which was 2 to 3 times greater than what was
reported from the pivotal phase 3 studies with docetaxel
in patients CRPC.2,3 Some of this frequency was because
we obtained blood counts on a weekly basis, which was
not done on the other docetaxel trials. However, this high
level of neutropenia did not translate into an increased
incidence of febrile neutropenia.
Bevacizumab-induced grade 3 or 4 hypertension
was observed in 5% of patients but was controlled. There
were 3 treatment-related deaths among patients who
received the bevacizumab combination. Those deaths
were attributed to an infection without neutropenia, a
mesenteric vein thrombosis, and a bowel perforation.
Although the addition of bevacizumab appears to have
contributed to the deaths of these patients, the mortality
from arterial thromboembolic events or other causes in
the current study does not appear to be higher than that
reported in other studies of other tumors in elderly populations that received bevacizumab combinations.19 In
addition, it is clear that the use of estramustine may have
contributed to some of these vascular-related events. The
incidence of thrombosis in the current trial was not differ-

532

ent from that in other trials that used estramustine.20
Overall, the safety data from our study indicate that the
addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel may modestly
increase the morbidity of the therapy in this elderly population, and appropriate patient selection is required to
maintain safety when using bevacizumab.
In summary, the current phase 2 trial has demonstrated that the addition of VEGF blockade with bevacizumab to a docetaxel-based regimen for the treatment of
patients with metastatic CRPC is feasible, well tolerated,
and may provide clinical benefit. The encouraging results
observed with this regimen have formed the basis for an
intergroup, phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled
trial in CRPC that is comparing docetaxel and prednisone
with or without bevacizumab with a primary endpoint of
overall survival. That study is fully accrued, and the data
are maturing.
