Abstract
BRD4 is implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of different cancers. It is also the target of
translocation t(15;19) that accounts for the highly aggressive NUT midline carcinoma (NMC). We discovered
that t(15;19) NMC cells display the ability to grow into stem cell–like spheres and express an exceptionally
high level of the stem cell marker, SOX2. The BRD4-NUT fusion oncogene resulting from t(15;19) translocation
is required for the abnormal activation of SOX2, which drives the stem cell–like proliferation and cellular
transformation in NMC cells. SOX2 knockdown phenocopies the effects of BRD4-NUT inhibition, whereas
ectopic SOX2 expression rescues the phenotype. The BRD4-NUT–induced abnormal SOX2 activation was
observed in multiple NMC cell lines as well as in NMC primary tumors. We further demonstrate that BRD4NUT oncoprotein recruits p300 to stimulate transcription activation and that inhibition of p300 represses
SOX2 transcription in NMC cells. These studies identify this stem cell marker as a novel BRD4-NUT target that
supports the highly aggressive transforming activity of t(15;19) carcinomas. Our study provides new
mechanistic insights for understanding how alteration of BRD4 function by BRD4-NUT oncogene leads to
the highly malignant NMC carcinoma. Because abnormal stem cell self-renewal is frequently observed during
tumor formation and metastasis, the aberrant stem cell–like proliferation associated with BRD4 dysregulation observed in NMC carcinoma may have implications for studying the oncogenic mechanism of other
BRD4-associated tumors. Cancer Res; 74(12); 3332–43. 2014 AACR.

Introduction
The t(15;19) translocation is one of the ﬁrst few somatically
acquired recurrent chromosome translocations identiﬁed in
squamous cell carcinomas (1). These translocation-induced
tumors, termed NUT midline carcinoma (NMC), represent the
most lethal subset of squamous cell carcinomas (2). All of the
known t(15;19)-positive carcinomas metastasize rapidly and
are extremely aggressive with a median survival of <7 months
(2). NMC tumors typically display remarkably simple karyotypes, suggesting that this translocation may represent a shortcut to bypass the complex process of accumulating genetic
mutations that are typically required for developing invasive

squamous cell carcinomas (2). The simple genetic alteration in
NMCs also suggests that this translocation may induce a
potent transforming activity in the affected chromosome
regions (2, 3). These carcinomas respond poorly to standard
chemotherapeutic strategies (2). Therefore, it is important to
determine the oncogenic mechanisms of these carcinomas for
developing novel therapeutic approaches.
The BRD4 gene on chromosome 19 and NUT gene (Nuclear
protein in testis, aka NUTM1) on chromosome 15 are targets of
translocation t(15;19) (1). BRD4 belongs to the bromodomain
and extraterminal (BET) protein family. It is normally
expressed as naturally occurring long and short isoforms. The
t(15;19) translocation breakpoint splits the coding sequence of
the long BRD4 transcript approximately in half, resulting in the
in-frame fusion of the BRD4 N-terminal double bromodomains
and extraterminal domain with nearly the entire sequence of
NUT (1). Interestingly, some chromosomal translocations also
lead to the fusion of NUT to BRD3 encoding another BET
protein (4). These observations suggest that fusion of NUT with
a BET protein may drive the oncogenic activity of these highly
aggressive NMCs.
BRD4 binds to acetylated chromatin through its double
bromodomains. It facilitates transcriptional regulation by
recruiting P-TEFb, mediators, and other transcriptional activators (5–7). BRD4 has been identiﬁed as a critical therapeutic
target in a number of different cancers (8–11), in which BRD4

BRD4-NUT Activates SOX2 to Support Cellular Transformation in NMC

has been shown to regulate c-MYC (7, 8, 10, 11). Dissociation of
BRD4 from chromatin also leads to selective inhibition of other
key oncogenes in tumor cells (7).
Given the established connection of BRD4 to cancer
development, the simple BRD4-NUT genetic alteration in t
(15;19) carcinomas provides an important tool to determine
how dysregulation of this gene leads to cancer. The dual
bromodomains tether the BRD4-NUT fusion oncoprotein to
chromatin (4, 12, 13). BRD4-NUT causes malignancy by
blocking NMC differentiation and driving tumor growth
(2, 4, 14). The NUT moiety of the fusion protein also sequesters histone acetyl-transferases to regional chromatin, leading to global transcriptional repression and inhibition of
cellular differentiation (12, 13). c-MYC has been shown to
be a downstream target of BRD4-NUT that blocks NMC
cellular differentiation (15).
Despite these current developments, it is still unclear how
the BRD4-NUT oncogene drives such highly aggressive carcinomas and why these tumors are unequivocally resistant to
conventional chemotherapy. In this study, we discover that
NMC cells have the potential to grow into stem cell–like
spheres. This stem cell–like feature was attributed to an
exceptionally high-level expression of sex-determining region
Y-box protein 2 (SOX2). SOX2 is a transcription factor essential
for stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency (16). Although SOX2
expression is normally restricted to stem cells, aberrant overexpression and ampliﬁcation of SOX2 has been reported in
many different types of solid tumors (17–31). SOX2-induced
aberrant stem cell self-renewal has been linked to its ability to
promote tumorigenicity and poorly differentiated morphology
(17, 25, 32, 33). However, the mechanism that regulates SOX2
expression in these cancers is not clearly understood. We
demonstrate that BRD4-NUT drives the abnormally high SOX2
expression in NMCs to promote the aberrant stem cell–like
growth feature, which underlies the highly aggressive transforming activity of the t(15;19) translocation. Our study identiﬁes SOX2 as a novel target for BRD4-NUT as well as a key
oncogenic driver of NMC tumor growth.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture, gene knockdown, and stable cells
HCC2429 (Dr. T.P. Dang, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA), Ty-82 (JCRB Cell Bank), 10-15 (15), and 14169 cells
were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal
bovine serum (Hyclone) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). The 10-15 and 14169 cells were provided by Christopher French, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA. All four cell
lines have been authenticated using BRD4-NUT Western blotting, Immunoﬂuorescent staining, and DNA sequencing as
described in the manuscript.
The nontarget control, BRD4, NUT, and SOX2 siRNAs were
purchased from Dharmacon. For siRNA knockdown, cells were
transfected using DharmaFECT reagents (Thermo Scientiﬁc).
For SOX2 double knockdown, cells were reseeded at 24 hours
after the ﬁrst siRNA transfection and retransfected with the
same siRNA 12 hours later. HCC2429 SOX2 stable cells were
generated as described in the Supplementary Methods.

Western blot analysis
These analyses were performed using standard protocols.
Additional experimental details are provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Immunoﬂuorescent staining
Immunoﬂuorescent staining was performed as previously
described (13). Speciﬁc antibodies and imaging methods are
described in the Supplementary Methods.
Sphere formation assay
Basic embryonic stem cells (ESC) medium was prepared by
supplementing knockout DMEM/F12 (Invitrogen) with 0.5%
N-2 (Invitrogen), 1% B27 (Invitrogen), 0.05% BSA (Invitrogen),
1% GlutaMAX (Invitrogen), and 1% Pen-strep. To prepare full
ESC medium, basic embryonic stem medium was supplemented with 10 ng/mL human BMP-4 (R&D), 1,000 U/mL LIF
(Millipore), and 1.5  104 mol/L 1-thioglycerol (Sigma). For
sphere formation assay, HCC2429 or Ty-82 were resuspended
as single cells in basic ESC medium, and seeded at 10 cells/well
in 96-well plates. For 10-15, cells were seeded at 20 cells/well in
96-well plates. After 6 to 7 days for HCC2429 and 10-15, or 9 to
10 days for Ty-82, spheres were counted from at least 24 wells
for each sample. The percentage of cells forming spheres was
calculated after counting the number of spheres formed from
240 to 480 seeded cells.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed
using a published method (34) with some modiﬁcations.
Formaldehyde was added directly to cell culture media at a
ﬁnal concentration of 1%. After incubation for 10 minutes at
room temperature, ﬁxation was stopped by adding glycine to a
ﬁnal concentration of 0.125 mol/L. Cells were scraped, collected, centrifuged, and swelled in cell lysis buffer (5 mmol/L
PIPES, pH 8.0, 85 mmol/L KCl, 1% NP-40, 0.1 mmol/L PMSF,
and 1 mg/mL leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A). After 1hour incubation on ice, nuclei were collected by centrifugation
at 4,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 C, resuspended in nuclei lysis
buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1% SDS, 10 mmol/L EDTA,
0.1 mmol/L PMSF, and 1 mg/mL leupeptin, aprotinin, and
pepstatin A) and incubated on ice for 10 minutes. Samples
were sonicated on ice to an average of 500 bp DNA length and
centrifuged at 14,000 rpm. The chromatin solution was precleared with Staph A cells (preblocked with 1 mg/mL sheared
herring sperm DNA and 1 mg/mL BSA for at least 4 hours at
4 C) for 15 minutes at 4 C. Chromatin from about 107 cells was
incubated with 3 mg of normal rabbit IgG (NR, Upstate), or
afﬁnity-puriﬁed rabbit polyclonal antibodies generated in our
lab for BRD4 C (recognizes BRD4 aa 1313–1362) or NUT. After
rotating at 4 C overnight, chromatin and antibody complexes
were immunoprecipitated by mixing with preblocked Staph A
cells at room temperature for 15 minutes. Immunoprecipitates
were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 3 minutes. The supernatant
from the NR antibody sample was saved as total chromatin
input. Staph A immuno-complexes were washed twice with
dialysis buffer (50 mmol/L Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mmol/L EDTA,
0.2% Sarkosyl, 0.1 mmol/L PMSF) and 4 times with ChIP wash

buffer (100 mmol/L Tris, pH 9.0, 500 mmol/L LiCl, 1% NP-40,
1% deoxycholic acid, 0.1 mmol/L PMSF). Immuno-complexes
were eluted from the Staph A cells using elution buffer (50
mmol/L NaHCO3, 1% SDS). Crosslinks were reversed by adding
NaCl to a ﬁnal concentration of 300 mmol/L and incubating at
67 C overnight. RNA was removed by incubation with RNase A
at 37 C for 30 to 60 minutes. DNA samples were puriﬁed using
PCR Puriﬁcation Kit (Qiagen) and eluted in 80 mL EB buffer.
Five microliters immunoprecipitated DNA or 1/50 of total
input chromatin was used in real-time PCR reaction with
primers listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analysis was performed using unpaired t test of
GraphPad Prism software (Version 5.0) to compare the data
from the control and experimental groups. A 2-tailed P value of
<0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.
Visualization of in situ activation of the LacO transgene
array
The LacI-CHERRY constructs were generated as described in
Supplementary Methods. U2OS 2-6-3 YFP-MS2 stable cell line
was from Dr. S.M. Janicki (35) and has been tested in the in situ
transcription assay as described in the Results. The cells were
transfected using Fugene HD reagent (Roche) and ﬁxed at 24hour posttransfection. Immunoﬂuorescent staining, imaging,
quantitative single-cell image analysis were performed as
described in the Supplementary Methods.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemistry on formalin-ﬁxed, parafﬁn-embedded archival sections of primary human NMC was performed
using a rabbit anti-SOX2 monoclonal antibody (1:100 dilution,
clone D6D9; Cell Signaling) following pressure cooker antigen
retrieval (citrate buffer; pH 6). Photographs were taken under
400 magniﬁcation.
Soft agar assay
The soft agar assay was performed as described previously
(36). Additional agar preparation and experimental details are
provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Reverse transcription-qPCR
Total RNA was isolated using NucleoSpin RNA II Kit
(Macherey-Nagel). Reverse transcription (RT) was performed
using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative
real-time PCR was performed using a CFX96 Real-Time PCR
Detection System (Bio-Rad) with IQ SYBR Green Supermix
(Bio-Rad). Primer sequences are shown in Supplementary
Table S1. Additional experimental details are fully described
in the Supplementary Methods.

Results
SOX2 gene is expressed at an exceptionally high level in
NMC cells
HCC2429 is a rapidly growing cell line established from a
t(15;19) translocation NMC (3). It carries 1 intact BRD4 locus

and expresses normal BRD4 as well as BRD4-NUT (13). In
normal medium, most HCC2429 cells grow in a monolayer and
display an epithelial morphology (Supplementary Fig. S1A).
However, a small population of the cells appeared round and
refractile, displaying some morphologic features of ESC. We
therefore tested HCC2429 in ESC medium. Interestingly, when
the cells attached to the plates were switched to ESC medium,
they gradually became nonadherent and grew into stem cell
sphere-like, refractile colonies (Supplementary Fig. S1B and
S1C). After seeding HCC2429 directly in basic ESC medium for
5 days, single cells could grow into condensed stem cell–like
spheres with a translucent, light-refractive appearance (Supplementary Fig. S1D–S1F). In addition, the sphere-forming
ability was maintained in these cells after continued passages.
Because this anchorage-independent growth represents one
of the important characteristics of cancer stem cells and the
sphere-forming ability was used to measure self-renewal
potential for these cells (37–40), we further examined other
stem cell features in HCC2429. Patches of HCC2429 cells were
found to express alkaline phosphatase, a stem cell membrane
marker (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that HCC2429 has
gained some stem cell–like growth properties.
To understand the stem cell-like feature of HCC2429, we
examined the major stem cell pluripotency markers in these
cells (Fig. 1A). A markedly higher level of SOX2 protein was
observed in HCC2429 compared with mouse embryonic stem
(mES) cells (Fig. 1A). However, OCT4 or NANOG was not
detected (Fig. 1A). High level of SOX2 was also detected in
C33A but was absent in all other cancer cell lines tested (Fig.
1A). In contrast, low level of c-MYC, an established target of
BRD4-NUT (15), was detected in HCC2429 and nearly all of the
other non-NMC cancer cell lines tested (Fig. 1A). We therefore
focused on the novel and unique induction of SOX2 in
HCC2429.
Abundant SOX2 transcripts were detected in HCC2429 (Fig.
1B). SOX2 protein was also clearly detected in HCC2429, in
which BRD4-NUT characteristically displayed punctate nuclear dots (Fig. 1C and ref. 13).
To ensure that SOX2 overstimulation is not an NMC cell
culture phenomenon, we also performed SOX2 immunohistochemical staining on ﬁve different cases of primary NMC
tumors. Four of these NMCs are BRD4-NUT positive and one
is BRD3-NUT positive. Interestingly, SOX2 was highly expressed
in four of the ﬁve primary tumors (Fig. 2A–D), including the
BRD3-NUT–positive case (Fig. 2D). This study provided in vivo
evidence for the SOX2 overstimulation in NMC tumors.
Preferential SOX2 overexpression has been tied to stem cell–
like phenotypes displayed by high-grade tumors (41). Our
results therefore led us to hypothesize that highly expressed
SOX2 may contribute to the stem cell–like growth features and
the highly aggressive oncogenic potential of HCC2429.
JQ1þ suppresses SOX2 expression, induces
differentiation, and abrogates sphere formation
The bromodomain inhibitor, JQ1þ, dissociates BRD4 and
BRD4-NUT from acetylated chromatin (14), and represses their
downstream target genes (8, 10, 11). We therefore tested the
JQ1þ effect on SOX2 expression (Fig. 3). HCC2429 treated with

100 nmol/L JQ1þ showed signiﬁcantly diminished SOX2 protein compared with the cells treated with the inactive stereoisomer JQ1 (Fig. 3A). JQ1þ also displayed a dose-dependent
inhibition on SOX2 expression (Supplementary Fig. S3). In
addition, JQ1þ-treated cells showed a decreased SOX2 mRNA
level compared with JQ1-treated cells (Fig. 3B). This inhibition was observed in HCC2429 treated with 500 nmol/L of JQ1þ
for 6 hours to avoid indirect effect on cell proliferation and
other gene expression, demonstrating a direct inhibition of
SOX2 expression by JQ1þ.
HCC2429 shows poorly differentiated cellular features
(13). Interestingly, as SOX2 was reduced in JQ1þ cells, there
was an increase in cellular differentiation, as indicated by
the induction of the terminal squamous differentiation
marker, involucrin (Fig. 3A). Involucrin gradually appeared
after day 3 in JQ1þ, and reached a much higher level on day 5,
whereas no involucrin was detected in JQ1 cells (Fig. 3A).
These results demonstrated an inverse correlation between
the SOX2 level and cellular differentiation. Moreover, JQ1þ
treatment dramatically inhibited sphere formation (Fig. 3C).

These data suggest that the acetyl-histone binding ability of
BRD4, BRD4-NUT, or both is required to support SOX2
upregulation and the undifferentiated stem cell–like growth
of HCC2429.
JQ1þ dissociates BRD4 and BRD4-NUT from the SOX2
regulatory regions
We tested how JQ1þ affects the occupancy of BRD4 and
BRD4-NUT at the SOX2 gene. BRD4 ChIP was performed using
an antibody that speciﬁcally recognizes the C-terminus of
native BRD4, but not BRD4-NUT, whereas BRD4-NUT ChIP
used a NUT-speciﬁc antibody. Primers spanning the SOX2 gene
Enhancer I (SRRI), promoter, and Enhancer II (SRRII) were
used in ChIP q-PCR to detect the binding of BRD4 and BRD4NUT to these regions (Fig. 3D). In addition, primers targeting
two nonspeciﬁc control regions (NC1 and NC2) outside of the
SOX2 gene were used as negative controls (Fig. 3E and F). BRD4
and BRD4-NUT ChIPs were performed using HCC2429 treated
with 500 nmol/L of either JQ1þ or JQ1 for 6 hours, as in the RTqPCR analysis (Fig. 3B). In JQ1 cells, BRD4 and BRD4-NUT

were found to be speciﬁcally recruited to the SOX2 gene
compared with the negative control regions (Fig. 3E and F).
BRD4 and BRD4-NUT occupy the SOX2 core proximal promoter, enhancers, and super-enhancer regions (17, 42–44),
with the binding peaks at the 1.5k and 900 regions surrounding the SOX2 core promoter (44). JQ1þ signiﬁcantly
inhibited the binding of both BRD4 and BRD4-NUT to the
SOX2 core promoter and enhancers (Fig. 3E and F).
BRD4-NUT knockdown inhibits SOX2 expression and
sphere formation while inducing differentiation
To speciﬁcally determine the role of BRD4 or BRD4-NUT
on SOX2 gene regulation, we tested how knockdown of BRD4
or BRD4-NUT affects SOX2 expression (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4). As shown in Fig. 4A and Supplementary
S4A, SOX2 protein was speciﬁcally reduced in BRD4-NUT
knockdown cells. Compared with control siRNA treatment,
BRD4-NUT knockdown also reduced the SOX2 mRNA levels
(Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B). Surprisingly, the SOX2
mRNA level was not affected by knockdown of the long
isoform of BRD4 (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that BRD4NUT plays a more important role than BRD4 in driving SOX2
upregulation.
Similar to JQ1þ treatment, involucrin was also signiﬁcantly
induced in NUT siRNA-treated cells at 48 hours posttransfection (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Cells treated with
NUT siRNA also showed markedly impaired sphere formation
(Fig. 4D). Because BRD4-NUT knockdown downregulates
SOX2 expression and inhibits stem cell–like sphere formation,
BRD4-NUT is likely playing an important role in supporting
SOX2 expression and the stem cell–like proliferation in
HCC2429.

SOX2 knockdown induces differentiation while
inhibiting sphere formation and transformation
SOX2 enforces self-renewal in ESCs by promoting pluripotency-related genes and suppressing differentiation-related
genes (16). SOX2 overexpression correlates with advanced
malignancy grade and poor prognosis in a number of solid
tumors (18, 19, 21). Both JQ1þ and NUT siRNA-induced inhibition of SOX2 expression correlates with a decrease in sphere
formation and an increase in differentiation (Figs. 3, 4, and
Supplementary Fig. S4), raising the possibility that high SOX2
expression in HCC2429 may support proliferation in the stem
cell–like manner while inhibiting differentiation. To directly
test this, we performed siRNA-mediated SOX2 knockdown in
HCC2429. Single transfection of SOX2 siRNA resulted in moderate SOX2 knockdown, likely because SOX2 is robustly
expressed in HCC2429 (Fig. 1). SOX2 siRNAs were therefore
transfected twice sequentially into the cells to achieve a more
efﬁcient knockdown (Fig. 5A). Similar to JQ1þ and NUT siRNA
treatments (Figs. 3, 4 and Supplementary Fig. S4), an induction
of involucrin was observed speciﬁcally in SOX2 knockdown
cells (Fig. 5A), providing direct evidence that SOX2 functions as
a key BRD4-NUT downstream target to block cellular
differentiation.
Because SOX2 is essential for stem cell self-renewal, we
speculated that SOX2 expressed in HCC2429 might be the
major driving force for the cells to grow into stem cell–like
spheres. Indeed, the percentage of cells forming spheres was
signiﬁcantly reduced in cells treated with SOX2 siRNA (Fig. 5B),
conﬁrming that high level of SOX2 is needed to support sphere
growth. SOX2 knockdown also moderately inhibited HCC2429
proliferation under normal culture conditions (Supplementary
Fig. S5).

Because SOX2 expression enhances colony formation in
soft agar (28), we tested how SOX2 knockdown affects the
growth of HCC2429 in a soft agar assay. Compared with
control cells, SOX2 knockdown caused a nearly 50% reduction in the number of colonies grown in soft agar (Fig. 5C
and D), indicating a reduced transformation potential in
SOX2 knockdown cells. These results suggest that SOX2
functions as one of the target genes regulated by BRD4-NUT
to drive the aberrant stem cell–like property and cellular
transformation in HCC2429.
Ectopically expressed SOX2 rescues the cellular
differentiation induced by JQ1þ and NUT siRNA
The data so far suggest that BRD4-NUT drives SOX2 overexpression to support the highly transformed and poorly
differentiated phenotype of HCC2429. To directly test the
functional link between BRD4-NUT and SOX2, we generated
an HCC2429 cell line stably expressing an Xpress-tagged SOX2
from an inducible promoter. Robust Xpress-SOX2 expression
could be detected when the cells were treated with 0.1 mg/mL
doxycycline (Dox; Fig. 5E and Supplementary Fig. S6A). JQ1þ

knockdown, these results rule out off-target effects and support that SOX2 is an important target gene of BRD4-NUT that
blocks cellular differentiation.
Ectopic SOX2 expression rescues the growth inhibition
caused by JQ1þ and NUT siRNA
We next tested whether exogenous SOX2 could rescue the
growth inhibition caused by JQ1þ and NUT siRNA. In the
absence of Dox, JQ1þ leads to inhibition of cellular proliferation as indicated by the reduction of cells expressing the
proliferation marker, Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. S6C and
S6D). In cells treated with both JQ1þ and Dox, proliferation
was partially rescued (Supplementary Fig. S6C and S6D). BRD4NUT knockdown also inhibited cellular proliferation, reducing
the Ki67 staining in SOX2 stable cells without Dox induction
(Fig. 5F and G). This inhibition was also rescued by Doxinduced SOX2 expression (Fig. 5F and G). Together, these
results suggest that SOX2 plays an important role not only in
the BRD4-NUT-mediated blockade of differentiation but also
in the maintenance of NMC proliferation.

BRD4-NUT stimulated SOX2 overexpression also inhibits
differentiation and drives sphere formation in other
NMCs
This study established that BRD4-NUT stimulates SOX2
expression to support proliferation and to inhibit differentiation. To ensure that this is not an isolated phenomenon
restricted to HCC2429, we examined other NMC cell lines,
including 10-15 (15), 14169 (unpublished), and Ty-82 (45).
BRD4 was detected in these NMCs, conﬁrming the presence
of a wild-type BRD4 locus (Fig. 6A). Western blots also detected
BRD4-NUT in 10-15, 14169, and Ty-82 (Fig. 6A). Sequencing
analysis showed that t(15:19) translocation breaks BRD4 gene
at different sites in these tumors (Supplementary Fig. S7;
ref. 46), resulting in the fusion oncogene isoforms that encode
BRD4-NUT proteins with different sizes (Fig. 6A). Furthermore,
immunoﬂuorescent staining detected the characteristic punctate nuclear pattern of BRD4-NUT in all 3 cell lines (Fig. 6B).
Abundant SOX2 expression was also observed in these cells
(Fig. 6A and B), which was dramatically reduced upon BRD4NUT knockdown (Fig. 6C and D), suggesting that BRD4-NUT

also regulates SOX2 in these cells. Furthermore, knocking down
SOX2 in these NMCs also signiﬁcantly induced differentiation
and inhibited sphere formation (Supplementary Fig. S8). In
conclusion, SOX2 overexpression and the ability to form
spheres are common phenomena observed in all BRD4NUT–expressing NMCs tested, further supporting that SOX2
functions as an important target of BRD4-NUT to stimulate the
stem cell–like growth property.

controlled transactivator and Dox, whereas BRD4 long and
short isoforms tethered to the transgene array did not have
the same effect (Fig. 7A and B). These results are in line with
the data in Fig. 4 showing that BRD4-NUT knockdown
caused efﬁcient inhibition of SOX2 expression but BRD4
knockdown did not have the same effect.
The NUT moiety of the BRD4-NUT fusion protein has been
shown to interact with p300 and to stimulate its catalytic
activity (12). Immunoﬂuorescent staining showed that p300
was sequestered to the LacO locus by LacI-CHERRY–tagged
NUT or BRD4-NUT in all of the cells expressing these proteins
(Fig. 7A). In contrast, p300 was not recruited to the LacO
transgene array in cells expressing either LacI-CHERRY or the
BRD4 fusion proteins. Enrichment of p300 at the LacI-CHERRY-NUT-associated LacO locus was even signiﬁcantly higher
than those observed with VP16-activation domain (Fig. 7A),
which is a strong transcription activator that binds p300. These
results suggest that p300 may be recruited by BRD4-NUT to
support SOX2 transcription activation in NMC. Indeed, p300
colocalizes with BRD4-NUT in punctate chromatin foci and
also associates with the SOX2 gene in HCC2429 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Treatment of HCC2429 with p300 inhibitor, C646,
led to a complete dispersion of the BRD4-NUT and p300 foci
(Supplementary Fig. S9A; ref. 12). More importantly, C646
treatment also caused up to 65% reduction of SOX2 expression
within 4 hours, whereas expression of a known BRD4 target,
cyclin D1 (CCND1), was not affected (Fig. 7C and D). Together,
these studies provide mechanistic evidences to support that
BRD4-NUT is playing a dominating role in stimulating SOX2
expression through gain of function recruitment of p300.

Discussion
BRD4 has been identiﬁed as a critical therapeutic target in a
variety of human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms by which BRD4 contributes to cancer development are
not clearly understood. In this study, we discovered stem cell–
like sphere growth properties in NMC cancer cells. We found
that the stem cell marker SOX2 was expressed at a much higher
level in NMCs than in ESCs. BRD4-NUT is recruited to the SOX2
promoter and is required for the abnormal induction of SOX2,
which in turn drives the stem cell-like sphere growth and
transformation in NMC. SOX2 knockdown phenocopied the
effects of BRD4-NUT inhibition introduced by either JQ1þ or
siRNA, including the stimulation of cellular differentiation and
abrogation of stem cell–like sphere formation, whereas SOX2
expression from an exogenous promoter resistant to BET
regulation rescued the differentiation and growth suppression
phenotype. We also detected overexpression of SOX2 in primary NMC tumors, providing evidence for the in vivo role of
SOX2 overexpression in NMC. We therefore discovered SOX2 as
a previously unknown downstream target of BRD4-NUT in
NMC.
Recent studies revealed that the stem cell self-renewal
feature is shared with tumor cells and that the stem cell
regulatory networks contribute to the ESC-like phenotype
displayed by many aggressive tumors (28, 41). In line with our
ﬁndings, high SOX2 expression and oncogenic SOX2 ampliﬁcation have been frequently detected during the formation of
other squamous carcinomas (17–32). SOX2 self-renewal capacity has been linked to its ability to drive tumorigenic initiation
and progression (17, 25, 27, 32, 33). These studies support our

ﬁnding that SOX2 functions as a key oncogenic driver of the
highly aggressive NMC squamous cell carcinomas. In addition,
SOX20 s ability to suppress differentiation-associated genes, as
reported previously (16), may contribute to the poorly differentiated NMC morphology.
The molecular mechanisms that regulate SOX2 expression
during oncogenesis remain unclear. In this study, we show that
both BRD4-NUT and BRD4 are recruited to the SOX2 gene. This
is consistent with recent studies demonstrating that BRD4 is
selectively enriched at super-enhancers of key oncogenic
genes, and that super-enhancers are present at the master
ESC regulator genes, such as SOX2 (7, 43). Surprisingly,
although BRD4 is clearly recruited to the SOX2 promoter,
knockdown of BRD4 does not have the same inhibition effect
on SOX2 expression as observed with BRD4-NUT knockdown

(Figs. 3 and 4), suggesting that stimulation of SOX2 superactivation in NMC is a gain of function for BRD4-NUT. This
conclusion is further supported by our mechanistic studies
using the LacO transgene array. We showed that BRD4-NUT,
and even NUT alone, tethered to the LacO array is able to
recruit p300 and to strongly stimulate the transgene activation,
whereas BRD4 tethered to the same array does not have this
activity. Recruitment and activation of p300 by BRD4-NUT
could result in histone hyperacetylation and enrichment of
additional BRD4-NUT/BRD4, as well as other transcriptional
factors, to stimulate SOX2 overexpression. In line with this
notion, inhibition of p300 represses SOX2 transcription in NMC
(Fig. 7C and D). Together, our mechanistic studies provide
novel insights for understanding how BRD4-NUT oncogene
alters BRD4 function to contribute to oncogenic progression.

Similar to the inhibition of BRD4-NUT using JQ1þ or siRNAs,
SOX2 knockdown induces differentiation and inhibits sphere
formation. Exogenous SOX2 efﬁciently rescues the differentiation and proliferation suppression in JQ1þ or NUT siRNAtreated cells. These results suggest that SOX2 is involved in the
BRD4-NUT pathways to maintain the undifferentiated cellular
proliferation in NMC. However, it is possible that the cumulative action of many growth-promoting genes, including cMYC (7, 15), constitutes the BRD4-NUT downstream functional
networks to support NMC transformation. Nonetheless, our
collective results provide evidence that SOX2 is at least partly
responsible for maintaining the NMC cells in the undifferentiated and highly proliferative state.
It has been well established that cancer stem cells are more
resistant to conventional cancer therapies (47). Elimination
of cancer stem cells has therefore become an important
approach for preventing tumor progression, recurrence, and
metastasis. Nearly all of NMCs are refractory to conventional
chemotherapeutic regimens (2). Because SOX2 has been
shown to confer chemotherapy resistance to cancer stem
cells (19, 48–50), it is possible that the SOX2-associated sphere
growth features contribute to the chemoresistant nature of
NMCs. It will be promising to further investigate this potential
SOX2 function in NMC tumorigenesis and to determine if this
could be an efﬁcient therapeutic target for overcoming the
NMC chemoresistance.
BRD4 has become an important target for cancer therapy. In
this study, we present the ﬁrst line of evidence to show that
alteration of BRD4 function by BRD4-NUT oncogenic mutation
causes abnormal SOX2 overexpression, which contributes to
the oncogenic mechanism of the aggressive t(15;19) cancers.
Because abnormal stem cell self-renewal is frequently observed
during tumor formation and metastasis, the aberrant stem
cell–like proliferation associated with BRD4 dysregulation
observed in the highly malignant NMCs may have implications

for studying other BRD4-associated tumors. It will be interesting to test if BRD4 function is also altered in other BRD4associated cancers through different mechanism(s) to cause
stimulation of SOX2 expression and/or cancer stem cell–like
features. These studies may reveal the mechanisms underlying
the oncogenic activity of BRD4 in these tumors and promote
more effective anticancer strategies to overcome cancer stem
cell resistance to chemotherapy.
