BACKGROUND: Second-line treatment options in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited. Axitinib, a selective potent
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) of vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF) receptors 1, 2, and 3, merits exploration in HCC. METHODS:
This was a single-arm phase II trial of axitinib in advanced HCC. Eligible patients were Child-Pugh A/B7, with measurable progressive
disease after TKIs/antiangiogenic drugs. Axitinib was started at 5 mg twice daily orally, titrated from 2 to 10 mg twice daily as tolerated. The primary end point was tumor control at 16 weeks by RECIST1.1; secondary end points were response rate, comparing
response by RECIST1.1 to Choi and modified RECIST, exploring dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging models, safety, progression-free
(PFS), and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Thirty patients were treated. Of 26 patients evaluable for response, there were 3 partial
responses (PR) per RECIST1.1; 13 PR by Choi, 6 PR and 1 complete response by modified RECIST. Tumor control rate at 16 weeks was
42.3%. Two-week perfusion changes were noted on functional imaging. Of 21 patients with evaluable a-fetoprotein response, 43% had
>50% decrease from baseline. Most common axitinib-related grade 3/4 adverse events (AEs) were hypertension, thrombocytopenia
and diarrhea. Of 11 patients with any grade hypertension, 7 had disease control >36wks. Four patients discontinued treatment due to
AEs. Median PFS was 3.6months. Median OS was 7.1months. CONCLUSIONS: With 42.3% tumor control at 16weeks, primary endpoint
was met. Axitinib has shown encouraging tolerable clinical activity in VEGF-pretreated HCC patients but further study should be in a

INTRODUCTION
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide.1 Angiogenesis plays a
key role in growth and metastasis of many tumors, including HCC.2 Sorafenib (oral multikinase inhibitor), has been
established as standard first-line therapy for advanced HCC.3,4
There is no standard systemic therapy for patients who progress on prior antiangiogenics in advanced HCC. In
recent phase III studies in patients with advanced HCC that progressed on sorafenib, reported median time to progression
(TTP) for the placebo arms were 2.7 months5 and 2.6 months,6 whereas median overall survival (OS) for the placebo
groups was 8.2 months5 and 7.33 months.6 Axitinib, an oral, potent selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2, and 3 may have activity in HCC refractory to first-line therapy with multikinase inhibitors and
is a treatment option for second-line therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma progressing on first-line VEGF therapy,7
allaying concerns that prior exposure (any length) to antiangiogenics may alter the efficacy of axitinib.
Standard assessment of treatment efficacy in patients receiving antiangiogenics is particularly challenging in the
HCC population. Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) assesses response in patients with
HCC based on measurement of presumed viable tumor with arterial enhancement on a computerized tomography (CT)
scan. Modified RECIST assessment of response to sorafenib in 1 study8 identified a population of patients who included
22.6% responders, possibly more in line with treatment efficacy in terms of OS than the 2%-3% response rate (RR) as
assessed by RECIST reported in the SHARP study.3

Axitinib as Second-Line Treatment in HCC/McNamara et al

The Choi criteria, incorporating tumor density and
tumor size, were developed to evaluate tumor response in
patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumors
undergoing treatment with imatinib mesylate.9 It has been
suggested that Choi criteria and mRECIST are more
appropriate than RECIST1.110 for identifying responders
with long survival among advanced HCC patients benefiting from sorafenib.11 Prospective validation is lacking.
Finally, dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (DCE-US)
may provide an early measure of efficacy for antiangiogenics such as sorafenib in patients with advanced HCC.12
In this study we aimed to evaluate axitinib as
second-line treatment in advanced HCC to compare
response by RECIST1.1 with Choi and mRECIST criteria and to explore early tumor vasculature changes on
DCE-US.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design

Study End Points

This was a single-arm, open-label phase II study employing
Simon’s optimum 2-stage design13 in which axitinib was
administered in the second-line setting in patients with unresectable and/or metastatic HCC. The trial (NCT01334112)
was run in 2 institutions (Princess Margaret Cancer Centre,
Toronto, Ontario, and Tom Baker Cancer Centre, Calgary,
Alberta, Canada) and carried out in accordance with the
ethics committees of the participating institutions. Informed
consent was obtained from each patient.
Using axitinib as second-line treatment, it was desirable that tumor control such as response (RECIST1.1) or
stable disease (SD) be seen in >20% of patients at 16
weeks versus a 5% tumor control rate as the null hypothesis, considered a clinically meaningful radiological end
point in this population14,15 at the time of protocol development, based on median time to symptom progression
with first-line sorafenib,3 TTP, and median progressionfree survival (PFS)/PFS rate in second-line studies.16,17
The power was set at 80% and type I error at .05.
Ten patients were to be accrued in stage 1, an additional
20 patients in stage 2, for a total of 30. If no responses by
RECIST1.1 or excessive toxicity were seen at the end of
stage 1, the plan was to terminate the study.13

The primary end point was tumor control rate including
response rate as assessed by CT scan at 16 weeks using
RECIST1.1 criteria.14,15 Secondary end points were safety
(including adverse events profile and rate of grade 3/4 toxicity, graded according to NCI CTCv4.03),20 OS, and PFS.
In addition, response was estimated using Choi and mRECIST criteria; changes in tumor vascular perfusion were
evaluated by DCE-US. An exploratory analysis of axitinibinduced hypertension to explore the association between
hypertension and survival outcomes was conducted.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Inclusion criteria included unresectable and/or metastatic
HCC, either biopsy proven or with clinical evidence of
HCC (fulfilling standard imaging criteria for HCC and
having an a-fetoprotein [AFP] level >200 ng/mL),18,19
with recorded disease progression following treatment
with antiangiogenics; measurable tumor lesions not

Treatment

Starting dose of axitinib was 5 mg twice daily orally with
food on a continuous 28-day cycle until progressive disease (PD)/intolerable toxicity. Dose was reduced according to protocol-specified criteria or for lower grade
toxicities, if investigator deemed dose reduction/delay was
required in the interest of patient safety. Two dose reduction levels were permitted — initially 3 mg twice daily
and then 2 mg twice daily.
Patients who tolerated axitinib with no AEs related
to the study drug above NCI CTC AE grade 2 for a consecutive 4-week period had their dose increased to 7 mg
twice daily and to a maximum of 10 mg twice daily
(unless the patient’s blood pressure was >150/90 mm
Hg; an amendment allowed escalation if hypertension was
controlled medically).21
Efficacy Assessment

Tumor response was assessed every 8 weeks via CT using
RECIST1.1,10 Choi criteria,9 and mRECIST.8 All 3

assessment methods were completed by a radiologist
blinded to clinical outcome. There was adherence to
standard definitions for response.8-10 As per protocol, all
patients who had received at least 2 cycles of therapy and
had their disease reevaluated were considered evaluable
for response (exceptions were those who exhibited objective PD prior to end of cycle 1, also considered evaluable).
Individual patient numbers were assigned to patients
evaluable for response by RECIST1.1 for use in figures/
tables to enable ease of reader comparison with other
imaging/biomarker modalities.
Biomarker Assessments

Tumor blood volume was measured using DCE-US22 at
baseline and 2 weeks after starting axitinib (correlated
with PFS and OS). DCE-US was only available in the
Princess Margaret Cancer Centre. Serum AFP levels were
collected every 4 weeks. Patients who had baseline AFP
>ULN and at least 1 on-study AFP measurement were
analyzed. An AFP response was defined as >50% decrease
in AFP level.
1622

Statistical Methods

Baseline demographics and clinical characteristics of
patients treated/AEs are summarized. Response rate (RR)
was defined as the percentage of patients with a confirmed
CR/PR on treatment. Tumor control was defined as the
percentage of patients with a CR/PR/SD at the 16-week
CT scan. Kaplan-Meier estimates of OS were calculated
from date of first dose until death or censored on date of
last follow-up, and PFS was calculated to date of progression or death. The score test was performed to test the
associations between survival outcomes and percentage
change in sum of diameters of tumor lesions from baseline
using RECIST1.1, Choi criteria, mRECIST, and percentage change from baseline in DCE-US. Survival differences
between groups with and without hypertension or with
and without AFP reduction while on axitinib were examined using the log-rank test. All analyses were performed
using SAS v9.3 (Cary, NC). Apart from the primary end
point, there was no adjustment for multiple testing, as all
secondary end points were exploratory. Multivariable
analysis was not performed because of insufficient events.
RESULTS
Patient Characteristics

Thirty patients were enrolled in this trial (January 2011October 2013). Baseline characteristics are summarized in
Table 1. Median duration on prior systemic treatment
was 4 months. Median duration of axitinib treatment was
4 cycles (range, 1-23 cycles). Twenty-six patients were
evaluable for tumor control. Thirty patients were evaluable for toxicity.
Toxicity

Treatment-related AEs are summarized in Table 2. The
most frequently reported grade 3/4 AEs were hypertension (16.7%), thrombocytopenia (13.3%), and diarrhea
(10.0%). No bleeding events and no grade 4 hypertension/diarrhea were recorded. There were 2 patients with
grade 4 thrombocytopenia; neither had portal vein thrombosis. One of these patients had a dose delay of 1 week,
and axitinib was restarted at dose minus 1 on platelet recovery, which was tolerated. The other patient had treatment discontinued and was treated with intravenous
immunoglobulin and then with prednisone for idiopathic
thrombocytopenic purpura, with some recovery of platelets prior to eventual death secondary to PD. Eleven
patients (36.7%) experienced palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia syndrome, with 9 patients (30%) experiencing
only grade 1/2 events. Dose escalation >5 mg twice daily
was achieved in 6 patients (20%). No patient had dose

escalation >7 mg twice daily because of patient intolerance of grade 1/2 events. Dose interruptions or reductions
were common: 40% and 43%, respectively, with no difference in dose density between Child-Pugh A/B7
patients. Eight patients (26.7%) discontinued treatment
because of AEs, 4 (13.3%) considered related to axitinib
(diarrhea, 2; thrombocytopenia, 1; fatigue, 1; progression,
4). Nineteen patients (63.3%) discontinued treatment
secondary to PD.

Clinical Efficacy: Response

Twenty-six patients were evaluable for the primary end
point, tumor control rate using RECIST1.1 at 16 weeks.
Four patients were not evaluable. Axitinib induced a PR
in 1 patient and SD in 10 patients. The tumor control
rate was 42.3% (95% CI, 22.3%-63.1%). Two more
patients developed a PR by RECIST1.1 >32 weeks and
>93 weeks post commencement of axitinib, for an overall
RR of 11.5%.
Median duration of tumor control on treatment was
3.6 months (range, 1.1-23.4 months; Fig. 1). As of the
time of writing, 2 patients remain on axitinib treatment
without progression for 16.8 and 23.4 months (both progressed on sorafenib in <4 months).
Of 26 patients evaluable for response, best responses
to treatment with axitinib using RECIST1.1 were: PR, 3
patients (11.5%); SD, 16 weeks; 20 patients (77%); and
PD, 3 patients (11.5%). Best responses to treatment with
axitinib using Choi criteria were: PR, 13 patients
(50.0%); SD, 10 patients (38.5%); unable to determine
in 3. Best responses to treatment with axitinib using mRECIST were: CR, 1 patient (3.8%); PR, 6 patients
(23.1%); SD, 14 patients (53.8%); and nonavailability of

Clinical Efficacy: PFS and OS

With a median follow-up time of 7.0 months (range, 1.827.3 months) for all patients, median PFS for all patients
was 3.6 months (95% CI, 2.8-9.2 months; Fig. 3a);

as measured using DCE-US 2 weeks post commencement
of axitinib (8 of 12 patients), predicted better OS
(P 5 .05) but not PFS (P 5 .06).
Twenty-one patients had a baseline AFP >ULN.
Nine patients (43%) had an AFP response. The median
PFS for those patients who had <50% decline in AFP
levels was 3.5 months (95% CI, 2.3 months to not
reached), and 2.7 months (95% CI, 2.3 months to not

at baseline versus 6.7 months (95% CI, 3.6 months to

Results of Exploratory Analysis: Hypertension

Median time to hypertension on study was 2 weeks. Median PFS in 11 patients who developed CTCAEv4.03
grades 1-3 hypertension was 10.7 months (95% CI, 5.5
months to not reached) versus 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.34.6 months) in those who did not (P 5 .0004).
Median OS in those 11 patients who developed
hypertension was 17.2 months (95% CI, 13.5 months
to not reached) versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 3.1-9.0
months) in those who did not (P < .0001). Five patients
had preexisting hypertension, which was controlled on
antihypertensives prior to entering the trial. It is also
interesting that 7 of these hypertensive patients
remained on axitinib for >36 weeks, and this was where
we saw most of the PRs by RECIST and the other
modalities.

DISCUSSION
Typical RR to first-line sorafenib for treatment of
advanced HCC was 2-8%, with SD as the best response:
33%-71%,3,23 (no cutoff for tumor control highlighted).
Second-line therapy would be expected to have a lower
RR and incidence of SD.
With a 16-week cutoff, axitinib induced a PR in 1
patient and SD in 10 patients, equivalent to a RR of 3.8%
and tumor control of 42.3%, thus meeting the primary
end point of this study. Overall RR was 11.5%.
The median PFS and OS assessed by RECIST 1.1
for all patients enrolled were disappointing, 3.6 and 7.1
months, respectively. Another agent previously studied in
the second-line setting was brivanib. The median TTP
and OS in that phase II study (modified WHO tumor
response criteria) were 2.7 and 9.8 months, respectively,16

and 8.4 months, respectively,17 in the phase II setting,
with a negative phase III trial versus placebo reported.6
Therefore, despite variation in imaging assessments
between these studies, based on the failure of brivanib and
everolimus to demonstrate positive results in the phase III
second-line setting after sorafenib progression, it is
unlikely that axitinib, which yielded PFS and OS results
similar to these agents, would produce favorable results in
an unselected population of patients in a phase III clinical
trial.
However, clinical activity was observed in some
patients on this drug. Median PFS and OS in 11 patients
who developed hypertension while on axitinib treatment
were 10.7 and 17.2 months, respectively, which is intriguing. Median time to onset of hypertension in this
study was 2 weeks, negating lead-time bias. Hypertension is primarily a VEGF-mediated process,24 and these
results are comparable to findings in a phase III randomized study of axitinib in patients with metastatic renal
cell carcinoma.25 This phenomenon raises the query of
whether dose-escalating axitinib in an endeavor to
achieve hypertension, better antitumor activity and
hence better survival may improve patient benefit and
requires further study. In the present study, dose escalation of axitinib above 5 mg twice daily was only achieved
in 20%; therefore, dose dependence could not be definitively assessed, but we may have been too cautious with
escalation. It does introduce the possibility of a trial
design that selects patients to continue axitinib following
early observation of hypertension as a potential biomarker response of clinically relevant benefit.

In this study of axitinib as second-line treatment for
HCC, we report prospective, comparative changes in tumor measurements using different radiological response
criteria. Changes in tumor density from baseline using
RECIST1.1 and Choi criteria9 were prognostic for both
PFS and OS. Modified RECIST (may be subjective when
no central review) was not prognostic for OS. Therefore,
Choi criteria, in addition to RECIST1.1, may be more
helpful as a standard treatment efficacy assessment, particularly in patients who are receiving antiangiogenics.
Contrast-enhanced US may warrant further study in
larger trials, as it may provide an early measure of efficacy
for antiangiogenics.12 In this preliminary study with a
small number of patients, a decrease in tumor blood volume, as measured using DCE-US, 2 weeks after starting
axitinib, predicted better OS.
Limitations of this study include that it was a singlearm phase II trial whose objective was to provide an early
signal rather than proof of efficacy. Also, exploratory
pharmacokinetic or tumor molecular characterization was
not included. For treatment advancement, biomarkerbased trials, with enrichment of HCC subpopulations
may be crucial for seeing a benefit. This is the strategy
with MET-positive tumors and tivantinib.26
However, this is novel data on the use of axitinib as
second-line treatment for advanced HCC in a patient
population that presently has no proven therapeutic
options. Toxicity on axitinib was manageable, and a signal
of activity was observed. Three other phase II studies of
axitinib as second-line treatment of advanced HCC are
ongoing or in follow-up.27-29 One study has reported that
axitinib statistically significantly improved median PFS
(3.6 versus 1.9 months with placebo) but not OS. Regional differences in efficacy were noted. However, the

desired HR for OS, 0.6, may have been overoptimistic,
but the trend to better survival of 12.7 versus 9.7 months
is encouraging.28 The combined experience should help
to indicate the best design for taking this drug forward in
select HCC patients, with valuable experience being
gleaned from studies investigating agents in unselected
HCC populations.27-30
In conclusion, axitinib has shown interesting tolerable clinical activity in this VEGF-pretreated HCC patient
population. Future studies should incorporate potential
biomarkers of response (AFP reduction, hypertension)
and pharmacokinetic analysis in an effort to improve the
therapeutic index of targeted drugs and guide biomarker
development, thus enabling a greater understanding of
the entity that is HCC.
