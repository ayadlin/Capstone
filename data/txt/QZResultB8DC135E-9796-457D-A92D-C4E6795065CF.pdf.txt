Abstract
Acquired resistance to therapy is perhaps the greatest challenge to effective clinical management of cancer. With several
inhibitors of the mitotic checkpoint kinase MPS1 in preclinical
development, we sought to investigate how resistance against
these inhibitors may arise so that mitigation or bypass strategies could be addressed as early as possible. Toward this end,
we modeled acquired resistance to the MPS1 inhibitors
AZ3146, NMS-P715, and CCT251455, identifying ﬁve point
mutations in the kinase domain of MPS1 that confer resistance
against multiple inhibitors. Structural studies showed how the
MPS1 mutants conferred resistance by causing steric hindrance

to inhibitor binding. Notably, we show that these mutations
occur in nontreated cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens, and that they also preexist in normal lymphoblast and
breast tissues. In a parallel piece of work, we also show that the
EGFR p.T790M mutation, the most common mutation conferring resistance to the EGFR inhibitor geﬁtinib, also preexists in
cancer cells and normal tissue. Our results therefore suggest
that mutations conferring resistance to targeted therapy occur
naturally in normal and malignant cells and these mutations do
not arise as a result of the increased mutagenic plasticity of
cancer cells. Cancer Res; 75(16); 3340–54. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

inhibition of MPS1 kinase activity, cells prematurely exit mitosis
with mis-attached/unaligned chromosomes, which causes severe
chromosome mis-segregation, aneuploidy, and cell death (6–10).
MPS1 has been suggested to be dysregulated in cancer cells;
speciﬁcally, MPS1 mRNA expression is elevated in a number of
cancers relative to normal tissue, including thyroid, breast,
lung, bladder, and glioblastoma, higher levels correlating with
a higher histologic grade, aggressiveness, and poor patient
survival in breast cancer, glioblastoma, and pancreatic ductal
adenocarcinoma (11–17). Furthermore, breast cancer cell lines
deﬁcient in the tumor-suppressor protein PTEN have been
reported to be more sensitive to MPS1 depletion or kinase
inhibition (18). As a result, MPS1 has attracted considerable
attention as a potential drug target for anticancer therapy, with
a number of small-molecule inhibitors recently identiﬁed and
under development (6–10, 19), or entering the clinic (BAY1161909; clinical trial ID NCT02138812).
The development of acquired resistance is one of the greatest
challenges to the effectiveness of targeted therapies in the clinic. A
number of different resistant mechanisms have been described,
including the upregulation/switching to alternative signaling
pathways, drug-efﬂux pumps, and drug-resistant mutations
(20, 21). One notable example of acquired resistance is from the
use of the BCR-ABL1 inhibitor imatinib in the treatment of
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Resistance to imatinib most
commonly occurs through mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase
domain; the most frequent mutation being the highly resistant
gatekeeper mutation p.T315I (22–24). Although second-generation inhibitors (dasatinib and nilotinib) are active against many
drug-resistant mutations, the p.T315I mutation still confers

In order for eukaryotic cells to undergo repetitive cell cycles, it is
essential that a cell faithfully duplicates and then equally segregates their genome. The regulation of mitosis is achieved through
an evolutionary conserved mechanism termed the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC); an inhibitory signal that prevents metaphase to anaphase transition until all sister chromatid pairs are
attached to mitotic spindle (via kinetochores; KT), in a bipolar
orientation (1). MPS1 (monopolar spindle 1; also known as TTK)
is a dual speciﬁcity serine, threonine, and tyrosine kinase (2),
which is vital for the recruitment of SAC proteins to unattached
KTs, the formation of the mitotic checkpoint complex and therefore, the inhibition of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). Furthermore, MPS1 is also required for chromosome alignment and error correction (3–5). Thus, following the

MPS1 Inhibitor–Resistant Mutations

strong resistance against both drugs (25–27). Thus, treating
T315I-containing CML remains a signiﬁcant unmet clinical need,
being addressed by third-generation of BCR-ABL1 inhibitors (28,
29). Encouragingly, pronatinib, designed speciﬁcally to overcome
p.T315I-induced resistance, has shown efﬁcacy against all BCRABL1 mutants tested (30, 31). However, these discoveries have
taken over 10 years; thus, preemptively discovering inhibitors to
target resistant mutations may have an important impact on
overall patient survival.
Because several MPS1 inhibitors are currently undergoing preclinical and clinical development, we decided to elucidate the
potential mechanisms that could render cells resistant to the
MPS1 inhibitors AZ3146 and NMS-P715, two of the ﬁrst
MPS1-speciﬁc inhibitors to be reported, and our own recently
identiﬁed inhibitor CCT251455 (6, 7, 19).

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and molecular cell biology
All cells were obtained from the ATCC (LGC Promochem) and
cultured in DMEM, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/L L-glutamine,
100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin. DLD1 Flp-In
T-Rex cells were obtained from S. Taylor (The University of
Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom) and stably transfected
as previously described (32). Cell viability assays were analyzed
using CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay after 4 days
(Promega). Colony formation assays were analyzed using Sulforhodamine B colorimetric assay after 14 days (SRB; Sigma). mRNA
was extracted from using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and MPS1
cDNA ampliﬁed using ImProm-II Reverse Transcription protocol
(Promega). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using
QuickChange II (Agilent Technologies). Tetracycline (Sigma) was
used at a ﬁnal concentration of 1 mg/mL, nocodazole (Sigma) at
200 ng/mL, paclitaxel (Sigma) at 200 nmol/L, and MG132
(Sigma) at 20 mmol/L.
IP-kinase assays
Myc-tagged MPS1 constructs were transfected into HEK293T
cells, arrested in nocodazole, lysed in lysis buffer (Cell Signaling
Technology) and Myc-MPS1 captured using 7 mg of anti-myc
antibody (4A6: Millipore, 05-724) coupled to Protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies). The immunoprecipitation (IP) was
then incubated with 10 mg of myelin basic protein (MBP; Sigma),
166 mmol/L ATP (Sigma) and 5 mCi ATP [g-33P] (PerkinElmer) for
30 minutes at 30 C. Reactions were stopped with SDS loading
buffer and boiling at 100 C for 5 minutes, run on NuPAGE TrisAcetate gels (Life Technologies) and stained with SimplyBlue
Safestain (Life Technologies). Radioactivity was quantiﬁed using
a 9410 Typhoon phosphorimager and ImageQuant software
(Amersham Biosciences).
Immunoﬂuorescence and time-lapse microscopy
For immunoﬂuorescence, cells were ﬁxed in 1% formaldehyde
for 5 minutes at room temperature, quenched in glycine, washed
in PBS-Triton X-100 (0.1% PBS-T) and incubated for 1 hour in
primary antibodies in PBS-T: MAD2 (Bethyl Laboratories Inc.,
A300-301A), CDC20 (Millipore, MAB3775), MPS1 (Millipore,
05-682), MPS1 pT33pS37 (Life Technologies, 44-1325G), and
ACA (ImmunoVision, HST-0100). After PBS-T washes, cells were
incubated with ﬂuorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life
Technologies), stained with DAPI (Life Technologies), and

www.aacrjournals.org

mounted onto slides with Vectashield (Vector Labs). Images were
acquired using a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope and processed using Velocity 3D Image analysis software (PerkinElmer).
Time-lapse microscopy was performed in 96-well Ibidi plate
(Thistle Scientiﬁc) using a Diaphot inverted microscope (Nikon),
in a humidiﬁed CO2 chamber at 37 C, using a motorized stage
(Prior Scientiﬁc), controlled by Simple PCI software (Compix).
Flow cytometry
Cells were ﬁxed in 70% ethanol, washed in PBS, incubated in 10
mg/mL propidium iodide and 0.5% RNase (Sigma) for 30 minutes
and analyzed using LSRII ﬂow cytometer (BD Biosciences). To
stain for mitosis, cells were incubated for 1 hour at 4 C with antiMPM2 antibodies (Millipore, 05-368), then 1 hour at 4 C with
FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies).
Meso scale discovery assay
Cellular IC50 values for MPS1 pS33pT37 autophosphorylation
inhibition were measured as previously described [Naud and
colleagues (19)].
Droplet digital PCR
Droplet digital PCR was carried out using a QX100 Droplet
Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) and TaqMan MGB primer-probes
(Applied Biosystems; Supplementary Experimental Procedures).
DNA was extracted from cell lines using Puregene cell and tissue
kit (Qaigen). Tumor and lymphoblast samples were fresh frozen.
An emulsion was made containing 10-mL Supermix buffer (BioRad), 1 mL of primer-probes mix (Life Technologies), DNA and
droplet oil using the QX100 droplet-generator (Bio-Rad). PCR
reactions were then carried out on a thermal cycler at 95 C for 10
minutes, 40 cycles of 95 C for 15 seconds and 57.5 C to 63.5 C
for 1 minute, then 10 minutes at 98 C. Plates were analyzed on a
Bio-Rad QX100 droplet reader using QuantaSoft software. Fraction abundances (FA%) were calculated as [a/(aþb)]  100, where
a is the total number of mutant-positive droplets and b is the total
number of wild-type (WT) positive droplets.
Protein production and puriﬁcation and crystal structure
determination
The MPS1-KD WT and mutant proteins were produced as previously described (19, 33). All crystallization experiments were
performed at 18 C by the sitting drop vapor diffusion technique.
Soaks were also carried out at 18 C. For cocrystallization experiments, preincubations of protein with ligands were performed for
30 minutes on ice prior to setting up crystallization plates. See
Supplementary Experimental Procedures for individual conditions.

Results
The generation of AZ3146-resistant cell lines
To investigate the mechanism through which human cancer
cells could develop resistance against MPS1 inhibitors, HCT116
cells were cultured for 10 days in 0.8 mmol/L (the GI50) of the
MPS1 inhibitor AZ3146 (7), then 2 mmol/L AZ3146 for 3 weeks.
Sixteen clones were isolated and cell lines generated, named AzR116, all of which were resistant to AZ3146-induced cell death in cell
viability assays (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Table S1); AzR3
and 4 had a GI50 of approximately 3 mmol/L (4-fold resistance),
while the remaining clones had a GI50 of approximately 9 mmol/L
(11-fold resistance; Fig. 1A). Because MPS1 is essential for the

MPS1 Inhibitor–Resistant Mutations

SAC, we reasoned a likely cause of drug resistance would be MPS1
point mutations, thus we sequenced the MPS1 gene. Each cell line
contained a single MPS1 point mutation (Fig. 1C); AzR3 and -4
contained a p.I531M mutation (c.1593A>G), while all the other
clones possessed a p.S611G mutation (c.1831A>G; Supplementary Table S1). Because all clones containing the same mutation
had a similar fold-resistance to AZ3146, we selected one cell line
containing each mutation to further characterize their SAC. When
we analyzed their cell-cycle proﬁles by ﬂow cytometry, while in
the parental cell line, the G1 and G2–M peaks are increasingly
abolished following treatment with 1 and 2 mmol/L AZ3146 (Fig.
1D), AzR1 and AzR3 remained unaffected, consistent with a
functional SAC in the presence of the inhibitor. Likewise, when
analyzing mitosis by time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 1E), while 2
mmol/L AZ3146 caused the parental cell line to rapidly exited
mitosis in 10 minutes, AzR1 and -3 remained in mitosis for the
normal length of time (25 minutes), with no apparent mitotic
defects, conﬁrming a functional SAC.
Having created cell lines resistant to AZ3146 (an 8-oxopurine),
we subsequently investigated whether these cells are resistant to
number of different structural classes of MPS1 inhibitors; a
diaminopyridine (ONCOII), triaminopyridine (SNG12), and a
pyrazoloquinazoline (NMS-P715), suggesting whether the mutations could cause cross-resistance in the clinic (Fig. 1F). Using a
cell viability assay, we show that the p.I531M-containing AzR3
cell clone was also resistant to the OncoTherapy compound II
(ONCOII, patent WO2011016472A1) and NMS-P715 (6)
although no resistance was seen to the Shionogi compound 12
(SNG12; ref. 34). The p.S611G-containing AzR1 cells conferred
up to 10-fold resistance against the ONCOII and SNG12 inhibitors; however, it showed no resistance against NMS-P715. These
data suggest that the p.I531M and p.S611G mutations are able to
confer resistance against a number of structurally different MPS1
inhibitors that bind to the hinge region of MPS1 kinase domain.
To conﬁrm that these MPS1 mutations alone were sufﬁcient to
cause resistance to MPS1 inhibitors, we ectopically expressed the
p.I531M, p.S611G, and a double mutant (Dbl) in DLD1 Flp-In TRex cells (Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B). Viability assays
conﬁrmed that expression of all three mutants, but not WT MPS1,
conferred resistance to AZ3146, with the Dbl construct being most
effective (Fig. 1G). Importantly, this drug resistance was also
associated with the rescue of SAC override (Supplementary Fig.
S1C–S1E). Expression of p.I531M, but not p.S611G, could also
rescue cell survival following NMS-P715 treatment (Supplementary Fig. S1F). Thus, these data conﬁrm that expression of drugresistant mutants alone confer resistance to MPS1 inhibitors while
not adversely affect mitosis.

To determine the effect of the mutations on MPS1 kinase
activity, we performed IP-kinase assays of Myc-tagged constructs.
All three mutants phosphorylated themselves and MBP to near
WT levels, suggesting they have normal activity (Fig. 1H). In
addition, we measured the inhibition of their kinase activity using
an in-cell, ﬂuorescence-based kinase assay using meso scale discovery (MSD) electrochemilluminescence technology (19), quantifying MPS1 T33/S37 autophosphorylation as a marker for
kinase activity. The WT construct had an IC50 of 1.48 mmol/L,
the p.I531M had 3.4 mmol/L, the p.S611G had 19.2 mmol/L, while
the double mutant had an IC50 > 25 mmol/L (Fig. 1I). MPS1
phosphorylation was further conﬁrmed by immunoblotting
(Supplementary Fig. S1G and S1H). We also generated recombinant full-length MPS1 p.S611G, which was 40-, and 15-fold more
resistant to ONCOII and AZ3146 than WT recombinant protein,
while NMS-P715 was equipotent (Supplementary Table S2).
These data conﬁrm that the mutations prevent the inhibition of
MPS1 by the small-molecule inhibitor AZ3146.
The generation of NMS-P715-resistant cell lines
Having created cell lines resistant to AZ3146, we subsequently investigated whether different mutations would emerge using
a structurally different chemical class. Therefore, we generated
HCT116 clones resistant to NMS-P715, the only MPS1 inhibitor
tested unaffected by the p.S611G mutation. Sequencing of 35
clones (NvR1–35) identiﬁed three new mutations: ﬁve clones
contained a p.M600T (c.1799T>C), nine a p.Y568C (c.1703A>G),
and 20 a p.C604W (c.1812T>G) mutation (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S3). One clone contained the previously characterized p.I531M mutation. All cell lines were resistant to NMS-P715–
induced cell killing in cell viability assays, conferring a similar
fold resistance (Fig. 2B and C and Supplementary Table S3).
However, this loss of cell viability at 2 mmol/L NMS-P715 was
not accompanied by the typical loss of cell-cycle proﬁle associated
with MPS1 inhibition (Fig. 2D), suggesting NMS-P715 caused
cell death in an off-target manner. To verify that the cell lines
contained a function SAC, the mitosis of the HCT116 cell lines
were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy (Fig. 2E). Upon treatment
with 1 mmol/L NMS-P715, only the parental HCT116 cells rapidly
exited mitosis, suggesting that the p.M600T, p.Y568C, and
p.C604W mutations prevent SAC override induced by NMS-P715.
Overexpression of p.M600T, p.Y568C, or p.C604W mutant
constructs in DLD1 Flp-In T-Rex cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A
and S2B) showed that each mutant was sufﬁcient to confer
resistance to NMS-P715 (Fig. 2F), restore the cell-cycle proﬁles
and prevent SAC-override caused by NMS-P715 (Supplementary
Fig. S2C–S2E). IP-kinase assays demonstrated that p.Y568C and

MPS1 Inhibitor–Resistant Mutations

p.C604W mutants phosphorylated themselves and MBP to WT
levels, whereas the p.M600T mutant was only autophosphorylated to 20% of WT levels (Fig. 2G). Despite this, the p.M600T
mutant still robustly phosphorylated MBP to 92% of WT levels.
Signiﬁcantly, all MPS1 mutants were phosphorylated to the
same extent in cells during mitosis, conﬁrming that they are all
comparably active (Supplementary Fig. 2F). In MSD assays, all
three mutants were resistant to NMS-P175, having an IC50 of: 3.5
mmol/L (4-fold), 8.2 mmol/L (10-fold), and >16 mmol/L (>21fold) for the p.M600T, p.Y568C, and p.C604W mutants, compared with approximately 0.77 mmol/L for the WT (Fig. 2H). In
addition, the p.I531M, but not p.S611G, also conferred resistance in the MSD assay (Fig. 2H). We also demonstrated that p.
M600T, p.Y568C, and p.C604W mutants could confer resistance
against AZ3146, ONCOII, and SNG12 (Fig. 2I). Furthermore, a
recombinant full-length MPS1 p.C604W mutant conferred 15fold resistance to AZ3146, 75-fold resistance to ONCOII and
148-fold resistance to NMS-P715, compared with the WT protein
(Supplementary Table S2). These data together suggest that these
mutations are sufﬁcient to cause resistance to MPS1 inhibitors
and NMS-P715 causes cell death through additional off-target
effects at higher concentrations.
CCT251455: a potent and selective MPS1 inhibitor that
overcomes resistance caused by the p.Y568C mutation
We have recently reported the discovery of a potent and
selective MPS1 inhibitor CCT251455 (a pyrrolopyridine) with
a GI50 of 0.16 mmol/L in HCT116 cells (Fig. 3A; ref. 19). Using
the MSD assay to measure MPS1 autophosphorylation at T676
and T33/S37, MPS1 kinase activity was inhibited at 0.22 and
0.04 mmol/L respectively, consistent with the cell viability data
(Fig. 3B). To conﬁrm that CCT251455 induces phenotypes
associated with MPS1 inhibition, we showed that the cell-cycle
proﬁles of HCT116 cells were abolished following 24-hour
treatment with 0.32 mmol/L CCT251455 (Fig. 3C). Likewise,
HeLa cells rapidly exited mitosis upon CCT251455 treatment,
98% of which had unaligned chromosomes (Fig. 3D) and
CCT251455 rapidly abrogated a previously established Taxol
or nocodazole-induced SAC (Fig. 3E). CCT251455 also severely
inhibited the kinetochore recruitment of MAD2, MAD1, ZW10
CDC20, while BUB1 and BUBR1 were reduced (Fig. 3F and
Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with previous reports
(7, 35). Conversely, MPS1 kinetochore localization increased
in the presence of CCT251455, although the pT33/S37 and
pT676 signals were no longer visible, conﬁrming that inactive
MPS1 binds to the kinetochore (7, 36). As controls, the kinetochore localization of ZWINT-1, CENP-E, CENP-F, and CENP-

A pS7 (a marker of Aurora B activity) remained unaffected by
inhibitor treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3).
To demonstrate whether CCT251455-induced cell death is
speciﬁcally through MPS1 inhibition, we tested CCT251455 in
our ﬁve drug-resistant HCT116 cell lines (Fig. 3G). Both the
p.S611G (AzR1) and p.C604W mutant cells (NvR12) conferred
high resistance (10- and 8-fold), p.I531M (AzR3) approximately
5-fold, while the p.M600T mutant (NvR1) conferred only 2-fold
resistance. However, the p.Y568C mutation (NvR11) did not
confer any resistance to CCT251455. This was further conﬁrmed
using the MSD assay (Fig. 3H) and in vitro using recombinant
p.S611G and p.C604W MPS1 proteins (Supplementary Table S2).
Interestingly, when we generated drug-resistant HCT116 cell
clones against CCT251455 using the same protocol as for AZ3146
and NMS-P715, we identiﬁed the p.S611G mutation in all clones,
conferring a similar 10-fold resistance to the inhibitor (Supplementary Fig. S4). These data together demonstrate that
CCT251455 kills cells speciﬁcally through MPS1 inhibition.
Crystal structures of MPS1 p.S611G in complex with MPS1
inhibitors
To provide insight into the structural basis for the observed
resistance of MPS1 to the inhibitors, we introduced the p.S611G
mutation into an MPS1 kinase domain construct (MPS1-KD,
residues 519–808) used for crystallization experiments (19) and
solved the crystal structures of the native (Supplementary Fig. S5)
and p.S611G MPS1-KD enzyme in binary complexes with the
8-oxopurine (AZ3146), the diaminopyridine (ONCOII), and the
pyrrolopyridine compound 1, a close structural analogue of
CCT251455.
To our surprise, the binding of AZ3146 to the WT and p.S611G
mutant MPS1-KD enzymes is almost identical (Fig. 4A). AZ3146
binds with two hydrogen bonds to the hinge, one between the
purine N1 and Gly605NH atoms, the other between the anilino
NH and Gly605O atoms (Fig. 4A). The N7-methyl group of
AZ3146 packs against the gatekeeper Met602 residue, and the
N9-cyclopentyl group projects into the space occupied by the NBoc substituent of CCT251455 bound to MPS1. The 2-methoxyanilino moiety projects toward solvent, positioning the piperidine group above the helix-capping Asp608-Ser611 motif (Fig.
4A). The activation loop was not resolved in either of these
structures, most likely due to the use of PEG300 in the crystallization conditions, as noted previously (19).
The diaminopyridine (ONCOII) also bound in a very similar
manner to the native and mutant enzymes in the crystal structures
(Fig. 4B), comparable with the related diaminopyridine inhibitor
reported in PDB entry 3VQU. In these crystal structures, the main

chain peptide of the gatekeeperþ2 residue, Cys604, is ﬂipped
relative to other inhibitor-bound MPS1KD structures, and provides the hinge-binding hydrogen bond interaction between the
Cys604 carbonyl with the anilino NH of the inhibitor (Fig. 4B).
The anilino substituent of ONCOII overlays well with the benzamide of the diaminopyridine inhibitor in 3VQU, but projects
further toward Ser611, to a similar extent as the methylimidazole
group of CCT251455. The 3-methoxynitrile aniline substituent
occupies the selectivity pocket next to the side chains of Cys604
and Gln541 and above the post-hinge residues 605–607, also
exploited by other MPS1 inhibitors (6, 19). The pyridine-5-cyano
group that points toward the Lys553NZ atom does not appear to
be a productive interaction. In the WT ONCOII-MPS1-KD structure, we also observed the almost complete ordering of the
activation loop, similar to that observed for a pyrimidodiazipine
inhibitor (9), but this was less well-ordered for the p.S611G
MPS1-KD bound to ONCOII with a short ordered segment
(residues 671–674) contacting the cyclohexyl group of ONCOII,
and residues 669–682 not visible in the electron density. However, this is most likely due to the use of PEG300 in crystallization
conditions (19). Likewise, the structure of p.S611G MPS1-KD in a
complex with compound 1 (Fig. 4C) revealed a binding mode
nearly identical to the previously reported WT MPS1-KD (PDB
4C4H; ref. 19) and very similar to CCT251455.
In summary, the crystal structures of both WT and p.S611G
MPS1-KD bound to three different classes of MPS1 inhibitors

www.aacrjournals.org

show only minor differences in inhibitor binding mode between
the WT and p.S611G mutant proteins. However, importantly, in
all three ligand-bound p.S611G MPS1-KD structures, the p.S611G
mutation was clearly apparent from the electron density surrounding this residue. Notably, this mutation removes the
helix-capping interaction of the Ser side chain with Asp608, and
the main chain of the resulting Gly residue is also more ﬂexible; it
is therefore likely that the S611G mutation results in greater
ﬂexibility of the aD helix. In support of this hypothesis, NMSP715 is the only inhibitor we have tested with a potency not
affected by the S611G mutation and that has a binding mode
that is incompatible with the ordering of the activation loop.
Therefore, we propose that the conformation of the activation
loop residues, which may be affected by the p.S611G mutation,
plays an important role in inhibitor resistance.
p.I531M and p.C604W mutations obstruct MPS1 inhibitorbinding
Molecular modeling of the p.I531M mutation using the crystal
structure of MPS1-KD in complex with ATP (PDB code 3HMN)
shows that the p.I531M mutation would not be expected to
abrogate MPS1 kinase activity, as a small subset of the commonly
observed rotamers of the larger methionine side-chain can still be
accommodated next to the bound nucleotide (Fig. 5A). However,
modeling the p.I531M mutation in the MPS1-KD structure bound
to AZ3146 shows that all methionine rotamers would clash with

the anilino moiety or the cyclopentyl group of the inhibitor (Fig.
5B). Therefore, it is likely that the I531M mutation would confer
resistance to any inhibitor containing both a large group equivalent
to the anilino moiety and a substituent similar to the cyclopentyl
group of AZ3146. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that the
only inhibitor against which the p.I531M mutation in cells did not
confer resistance is the recently reported triaminopyridine inhibitor (SNG12; Fig. 1F), which contains a smaller aniline substituent
compared with the other tested MPS1 inhibitors.
In addition to the p.S611G MPS1-KD, we were also able to
elucidate the crystal structures of the p.C604W MPS1-KD
mutant in complex with the pyrazoloquinazoline NMSP715. The p.C604W mutation was clearly observed in the
electron density after molecular replacement, indicating that
the Trp side chain is well ordered in this structure. In comparison with the crystal structure of WT MPS1 bound to NMSP715 (PDB code 29E), the carbonyl group of Gly605 is

3348 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

rotated toward the ligand, due to steric hindrance by the bulky
Trp604 side-chain of the mutant protein (Fig. 5C). In both the
WT and p.C604W mutant structures, the ligand makes two Hbonds to the hinge and an additional H-bond between Lys553
and an amide oxygen atom. The latter H-bond acts as the
anchor point for rotation of the ligand away from the hinge
region in the C604W MPS1 mutant compared with the WT
enzyme. This rotation is caused by the bulky Trp604 side
chain, which would otherwise sterically clash with the triﬂuoromethoxy group of the ligand. All of the other inhibitors used
in this study contain a substitution comparable with the
anilino 2-triﬂuoromethoxy group of NMS-P715, explaining
the resistance conferred by the p.C604W mutation to all of
the MPS1 inhibitors described so far. For ONCOII, the Trp
mutation has a dual effect through causing both steric hindrance, as well as by losing a hinge binding interaction with
the anilino NH of the inhibitor.

MPS1 Inhibitor–Resistant Mutations

Discovery of MPS1 inhibitors overcoming MPS1-resistant
mutants
Because the p.C604W mutation caused resistance to all the
MPS1 inhibitors tested, we set out to design a compound to
speciﬁcally overcome this mutation. Thus, we synthesized two
related pyrrolopyridines in which the chlorine atom was replaced
with hydrogen or ﬂuorine (compound 2 and 3; Fig. 6A). When
tested in the drug-resistant cell lines, both compounds were more
potent toward NvR12 than the parental HCT116 cells, particularly
compound 2, which was 5-fold more potent in cells (Fig. 6B) and
in vitro (Supplementary Table S2). However, the other drugresistant mutations still conferred resistance to the inhibitors,
with p.S611G giving over 5-fold resistance, while p.Y568C,
p.M600T, and p.I531M were limited to approximately 2-fold
(Fig. 6B). We further conﬁrmed this increased effectiveness against
p.C604W by ﬂow cytometry; compound 2 caused a loss of cellcycle proﬁles at 100 nmol/L for NvR12, compared with 600
nmol/L for the parental and >900 nmol/L for AzR1 cells (Fig. 6C).
To understand why compound 2 was more active against the
p.C604W mutation, we determined the structures of both WT
and p.C604W MPS1-KD proteins with compound 2 (Fig. 6D
and E). The binding of compound 2 is almost identical to
CCT251455, with only a small difference in the torsion angles
between aniline and imidazole rings of approximately 14 , due
to the smaller H atom in the 2-position of the aniline of
compound 2. In the compound 2-bound p.C604W-mutant
structure, the P-loop residues from Ser526 to Ser537 are located
further away from the kinase hinge than in the WT structure due
to the larger Trp604 side chain. This results in a larger hydrophobic surface deﬁned by the side chains of Trp604 and Ile531,
against which the aromatic anilino substituent packs. Furthermore, as observed in the p.C604W structure with NMS-P715,
due to the larger side chain of Trp604, the carbonyl group of
Gly605 is rotated toward the anilino NH of the inhibitor. An
important difference between the structures of MPS1 with
NMS-P715 and compound 2 is the lack of a 2-anilino substituent in the latter, meaning that compound 2 is not rotated
away from the hinge by steric hindrance of the Trp604 side
chain. Indeed, the H-bond distance between the anilino NH
and the carbonyl oxygen atom of Gly605 is less than 2.8 Å in
the p.C604W-mutant structure compared with the equivalent
distance of more than 3.2 Å in the WT structure. Therefore, the
greater potency of compound 2 versus p.C604W-mutant MPS1
relative to WT is most likely due to a combination of improved
hinge-binding and more optimal hydrophobic interactions.
Drug-resistant mutations are preexisting in HCT116 cells
Having discovered a number of mutations that confer drug
resistance against multiple MPS1 inhibitors, we aimed to determine whether these mutations are preexisting within the cancer
cell population. To this end, we optimized small-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) assays using the QX100 Droplet Digital
PCR System (ddPCR; Bio-Rad) and TaqMan primer probes. An
emulsion was made containing approximately 10,000 gDNAcontaining droplets, then following a PCR reaction, the ﬂuorescence of each individual droplet was determined, allowing quantiﬁcation of the WT and mutant alleles. In each drug-resistant
HCT116 cell line, 43% to 50% of the droplets were positive for
the mutant allele, conﬁrming the cells were heterozygous for
the mutation (Fig. 7A and B). In parental HCT116 gDNA, the
p.S611G mutation was the most frequent mutation found at

www.aacrjournals.org

0.94%, followed by p.Y568C at 0.3%, while the p.I531M and
p.C604W mutations were the least frequent at 0.02% and 0.07%
(Fig. 7C). The number of mutant-positive droplets increased
proportionately with increasing concentrations of gDNA and
decreased with dilution, suggesting that these mutant-positive
droplets are a "true" signal (Supplementary Fig. S6A and S6B).
Furthermore, the FA of all mutants, except p.Y568C, increased
between 10- and 50-fold in HCT116 cells after 3 days selection
with 0.8 mmol/L AZ3146 (Supplementary Fig. S6C).
To address how speciﬁc these mutations were, we designed
primer probes for p.S611C and p.S611R mutations (A>T and
A>C mutations, respectively), and Tyr568 mutated to a stop
codon. When we tested HCT116 cells for these alternative
mutations, we did not detect a single droplet positive for any
of the mutations (Fig. 7D), whereas 16% to 37.4% of the
droplets were positive when spiked with mutant vector. Taken
together, these data suggest that the drug-resistant mutations
are speciﬁc and preexisting within the HCT116 population and
not due errors in the technique. In fact, we have seen that within
24 days outgrowth from a single cell, the drug-resistant mutations are detected in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. S6D).
Conversely, using the p.S611G-continaing AzR1 cells, the
Gly611 allele is mutated back to Ser in up to approximately
50% of the cells (Supplementary Fig. S6E), suggesting these
bases may be frequently mutated. In addition, these mutations
did not appear to give a ﬁtness/growth advantage compared
with WT cells when cultured in a 1:1 ratio under normal or low
serum conditions (Supplementary Fig. S6F).
Drug-resistant mutations can be detected in both cancer cells
and nontransformed cells
Because HCT116 cells contain a mismatch repair defect, we
hypothesized that the FA of the mutations may be higher in this
cell line compared with other cancer cells, thus we analyzed a
panel of 17 breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. However, the
drug-resistant mutations were typically identiﬁed in every cell line
at strikingly similar levels (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting
that these mutations are present in all cancer-cell lines at similar
frequencies. In agreement with these data, when we created drugresistant cell lines against AZ3146 and NMS-P715 in CAL51 cells,
the two mutations identiﬁed were p.S611G for AZ3146-treated
cells and p.Y568C for NMS-P715-treated cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7A and S7B).
Next, we investigated whether these mutations are found preexisting in patient tumor samples, suggesting they could be
selected for in the clinic. We analyzed the gDNA of 14 treatment-na€ve (BamHI-digested), invasive breast carcinomas of no
special type (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6; ref. 37). The
p.S611G and p.Y568C mutations were detected in every tumor
sample, although typically at a lower FA than in the cell lines;
<0.2% and <0.09%, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). The
p.I531M mutation was detected in 13 tumors at 0.1% to 0.4%,
the p.C604W in 10 tumors at 0.03% to 0.37%, while the p.M600T
was only detected in ﬁve samples. The mutations could also be
detected in undigested tumor gDNA (Supplementary Table S7),
although in fewer samples and at a lower FA, likely due to a
reduced efﬁciency in the PCR ampliﬁcation.
To determine whether these preexisting mutations were speciﬁc
to cancer cells, we then also analyzed eight lymphoblast gDNA
samples from healthy individuals. Surprisingly, each mutation
was also identiﬁed in the majority of lymphoblast samples tested

(Supplementary Table S8), again with the p.S611G mutation
typically at the highest FA. We then also analyzed ﬁve normal
breast tissue samples for the presence of the p.S611G mutation.
p.S611G was identiﬁed with a FA of 0.04% to 0.07% in four of
the ﬁve samples (Supplementary Fig. S6G), again suggesting
that this mutation is preexisting in normal, nontransformed
cells.
Finally, to address whether mutations in other genes that confer
acquired drug resistance are also naturally occurring, we optimized a SNP assay to identify the EGFR p.T790M gatekeeper
mutation, a major cause of resistance to geﬁtinib treatment. When

we analyzed the HCT116 gDNA alone, the p.T790M mutation was
detected at a FA of 0.08%, which increased to 99.5% of droplets
when spiked with synthetic Ultramer oligos (Fig. 7E). Furthermore, the p.T790M mutant was detected 12 of the 17 breast and
pancreatic cancer cell lines tested, at <0.08% (Supplementary
Table S9A), in half the lymphoblast samples (Supplementary
Table S9B), as well as in four of normal breast tissue samples
(Supplementary Fig. S6G). These results would suggest that point
mutations conferring acquired drug resistance to MPS1 and EGFR
inhibitors are naturally occurring mutations, preexisting in both
normal and cancer cells.

Discussion
Although kinase inhibitors can be very effective in the clinic
(38), their success has been limited by the emergence of drug
resistance. The most common and well-documented causes of
drug resistance are mutations or ampliﬁcations of the drug target
itself, or in alternative genes that activate parallel or downstream
signaling pathways (20, 21). Here, we describe the development
of drug-resistant HCT116 cell lines, using the MPS1 inhibitors
AZ3146, NMS-P715, and CCT251455. Cell culture models have
been used previously to successfully identify mechanisms of
resistance that also develop in the clinic (39, 40). Each inhibitor
resulted in the generation of common and drug-speciﬁc MPS1
point mutations, with each mutation conferring resistance against
multiple MPS1 inhibitors, the effectiveness depending on the
binding mode of the inhibitor. Although we identiﬁed ﬁve
mutations contained within the ATP-binding pocket of MPS1,
this neither excludes the possibility that other resistant mechanisms may exist, such as drug efﬂux pumps, nor that additional
MPS1 mutations may also cause resistance. For example, BCRABL1 tolerates mutations in over 60 amino acid positions that
confer drug resistance (24). Furthermore, ectopic expression of an
MPS1 gatekeeper mutant (p.M602Q), can confer resistance to
alternative MPS1 inhibitors (9).
In this article, we extensively characterize novel MPS1 mutations, both in function and their frequency in the population,
presenting compelling evidence to explain why speciﬁc mutations
consistently arise following inhibitor treatment. Using ddPCR, we
show that each point mutation is preexisting within every cancer
cell line examined at similar frequencies, regardless of their
mutational background. Crucially, when we looked for three
alternative point mutations, none were detected in the cell population, suggesting that these mutations either do not occur, thus
are speciﬁc in nature, or they may render MPS1 nonfunctional,
thus are eliminated from the population. We also found that
multiple inhibitors led to the selection of the most frequent and
resistant p.S611G mutation, suggesting that important factors
pertinent to the selection of a particular mutation including (i)
the fold resistance the mutation confers, as well as (ii) its FA in the
population. Interestingly, when looking at the Cosmic or cBioPortal databases, a large number of mutations have been reported
in the MPS1 gene in tumor samples, including p.G534E, p.
D566G, Y599C, p.M600I, p.V601I, and p.C604F; residues very
close to, or the same as we found mutated in this study (p.I531M,
p.Y568C, p.M600T, p.C604W, and p.S611G). Although all these
previously identiﬁed mutations are completely uncharacterized
with no functional data reported, and in some cases are unveriﬁed, together with our data it suggests that the kinase domain of
MPS1 may be frequently mutated in cancer cells, thus providing
the potential for cells to develop acquired resistance against
inhibitors. However, how frequently these other mutations are
found in tumors or are preexisting in normal tissue, whether they
affect the function of MPS1, or whether they could confer resistance to MPS1 inhibitors is unknown. Preexisting mutations
being speciﬁc in nature would also explain why, despite the
introduction of gatekeeper mutations into the BRAFV600E protein
conferring drug resistance in vitro (41), these mutations have never
been identiﬁed in cell lines or tissue samples. Thus, we speculate
that these mutations are not naturally occurring in BRAF, or are
much less frequent compared with other resistant mechanisms
(42, 43).

3352 Cancer Res; 75(16) August 15, 2015

A critical question for anticancer therapy is what is the origin/
cause of acquired resistance. Our data indicate that acquired drug
resistance occurs through the selection of preexisting genetic
differences within the tumor population. Indeed, we show that
these mutations are rapidly selected for in cells upon inhibitor
treatment; increasing up to 50-fold in only 3 days selection with a
GI50 concentration. Mutations conferring resistance to BCR-ABL1
inhibitors have also been shown to be present in both pre- and
postinhibitor treated tumors (24, 44). Likewise, the p.T790M
gatekeeper mutation in EGFR has been detected pretreatment in
non–small cell lung cancer, although this mutation is thought to
have some oncogenic properties (45–47). Our data signiﬁcantly
expand upon these previous studies in showing, for the ﬁrst time,
that both MPS1 and EGFR drug-resistant mutations are preexisting not only in a large number of cancer cell lines and tumors, but
are also naturally occurring in healthy, normal lymphoblast and
breast tissues. This result is contrary to preexisting MET ampliﬁcations (causing resistance to geﬁtinib), which is suggested to be
cell-line speciﬁc (48). This suggests that the origin of mutations
causing acquired resistance may not be a result of high mutagenic
rates in cancer cells as previously thought, but from naturally
occurring mutations in normal tissues. Although we cannot rule
out some low-level selective advantage for these MPS1 mutations,
we believe that their constant low levels in cancer cell lines, as well
as their emergence within weeks of expanding clonal populations,
suggests that these residues are frequently and speciﬁcally
mutated.
The knowledge that mutations conferring resistance to kinaseinhibitor therapy are preexisting in normal cells highlights the
need to identify strategies to overcome drug-resistance early
during drug development. Although the p.S611G mutation typically caused high resistance to all inhibitors tested, NMS-P715
was unaffected, highlighting the potential to synthesize compounds to overcome this common resistant mutation. Likewise,
the p.I531M and p.Y568C mutations were not effective at causing
resistance to SNG12 and CCT251455, respectively. However, of
concern, we found that the p.C604W MPS1 mutation conferred
resistance to all the inhibitors tested, due to the steric hindrance
caused by the bulky Trp residue in the hinge-binding region.
Nevertheless, based on the crystal structure of CCT251455 bound
to MPS1, we were able to design two compounds that not only
avoid this clash, but that more potently targeted the mutant
compared with WT kinase. Because all the mutations identiﬁed
in this study were preexisting in cancer cells, it would suggest that
the development of acquired resistance is an inevitable outcome
following inhibitor treatment with a single agent. However,
because different inhibitors remain effective against distinct
mutations, we would suggest that using a variety of MPS1 inhibitors, either in combination or via cyclical treatment, may be
beneﬁcial in combating the development of resistance. Alternatively, by monitoring the development of mutations in a relapsing
tumor, it would be possible to then select the appropriate inhibitor to overcome the resistance as a second line treatment.
In conclusion, our data would agree with Diaz and colleagues
(49) that resistance is a "fait accompli". However, we demonstrate
that the drug-resistant mutations are actually preexisting in normal, as well as cancer cells, most likely being introduced during
continued proliferation. This would explain why acquired resistance is so rapidly encountered in the clinic with targeted therapies
and suggests it is imperative to identify and prepare strategies to
address this issue early during drug discovery.
