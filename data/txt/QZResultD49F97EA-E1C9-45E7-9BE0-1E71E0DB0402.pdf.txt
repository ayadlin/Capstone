BACKGROUND: The last 3 decades have witnessed limited therapeutic advances in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) management. This
study evaluated real-world trends in the use of systemic therapies and the impact on patient outcomes in the United States. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results–Medicare database was used to find patients diagnosed with SCLC between
1985 and 2005. The 1985-1990 period served as the baseline for a temporal analysis conducted at 5-year intervals (1985-1990, 19911995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2005). Cox proportional models were used to estimate the effect of chemotherapy on survival. Results
were validated with a propensity-matched analysis. RESULTS: There were 47,351 eligible patients: 52% were male; the median age
was 71 years; and 87% were white, 7% were black, and 1.4% were Asian. The proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy was
low but increased over time (38%, 55%, 50%, and 53%; P < .001). Race, diagnosis period, age, stage, and location of residence significantly predicted chemotherapy use. Females (51%), Asians (53%), and rural residents (60%) were more likely to receive chemotherapy. The median overall survival with and without chemotherapy was 9.6 and 3.6 months, respectively. Linear trend analyses showed
a modest reduction in the impact of chemotherapy on survival for patients treated with chemotherapy versus untreated patients
(hazard ratios [HRs], 0.59, 0.61, 0.64, and 0.62; P < .001) but an overall trend of improved survival for treated (HRs, 1.0, 1.03, 1.00, and
0.96; P 5 .005) and untreated patients (HRs, 1.0, 0.99, 0.94, and 0.92; P < .001). There was no survival difference between patients
treated with carboplatin and patients treated with cisplatin (HR, 0.99; confidence interval [CI], 0.81-1.19; P 5 .875). Additional therapy
beyond platinum-based chemotherapy was associated with a survival benefit (HR, 0.78; CI, 0.75-0.81; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:
Chemotherapy use was associated with a survival benefit in Medicare patients with SCLC treated in a real-world setting. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality,1,2 and more than 220,000 new cases of lung cancer were estimated to have been diagnosed in the United States in 2014.3 Although the proportion of cases diagnosed as small cell lung
cancer (SCLC) has declined from approximately 20% to 13%, this subset is still a major cause of disease burden with close
to 30,000 new cases annually.4-6 SCLC is associated with a poor prognosis overall, and the median survival for untreated
patients has been reported to be 2 to 4 months.7,8
Systemic chemotherapy remains a cornerstone of the management of SCLC.9 Platinum-based doublet chemotherapy, single-agent topotecan, and the multiagent chemotherapy regimen of cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and vincristine
are established regimens in the frontline and postfrontline settings.9 Because of the unsuccessful attempts of prospective
clinical trials to establish the efficacy of newer treatment options for this disease in the last 3 decades, agents with

promising efficacy in small phase 2 studies are commonly
used on the basis of the endorsement and guidelines enunciated by professional bodies.10 Such agents include paclitaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine, and docetaxel.10
The utilization of systemic agents in the real world is
limited by their significant toxicity coupled with a high
prevalence of other tobacco-related comorbid illnesses in
patients with SCLC. It is well known that a large proportion of patients with advanced lung cancer do not receive
potentially beneficial treatment.6 Whether therapies recommended for the treatment of SCLC based on evidence
from clinical trials and/or consensus guidelines are
adopted in the real-world setting has not been carefully
studied. Moreover, the clinical benefit of these therapeutic
agents in the real world remains to be demonstrated. We,
therefore, studied the predictors and clinical impact of
systemic agents available for real-world management of
SCLC in the last 3 decades. We also examined the pattern
and trends in usage of chemotherapy agents in patients
with SCLC and the clinical or socioeconomic factors that
influence and predict the use of systemic therapy for
SCLC. We also analyzed trends in the use of systemic
therapy and the impact of these agents on patient survival.
In this analysis, we used the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare database11 to evaluate trends in the real-world efficacy of
available systemic therapies and the impact on outcomes
in the United States over 2 decades.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The Medicare database, maintained by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services for eligible US residents,
covers 97% of the US population aged 65 years or older.12
This database is purpose-linked to the cancer registry data
maintained by the SEER program of the National Cancer
Institute. The SEER database is a quality-assured cancer
data repository that collects data from 17 cancer registries
across the entire United States. SEER registries cover
approximately 25% of the whole US population and contain a complete data set on treatment information for
approximately 93% of all eligible patients.12 The linkage
of the SEER and Medicare databases (SEER-Medicare)
provides full treatment information from the Medicare
insurance program along with individual patient–level
clinical and survival data from the population-based
SEER cancer registry program.11 This database has been
previously used to interrogate the interplay between
treatment intervention and patient characteristics and
outcomes. The SEER program managers and the instituCancer

Data Extraction

Patients were identified with International Classification of
Diseases for Oncology (3rd edition) codes 8041 to 8045.
Chemotherapy information was obtained from the linked
data via the chemotherapy procedure and administration
data set from the Medicare claims file (Medicare Provider
Analysis and Review, Durable Medical Equipment,
Home Health Agency, HSPS, National Claims History,
and Outpatient Statistical Analysis File) for every year
from 1985 to 2005 with the following drug-specific
codes: vinorelbine (J9390), pemetrexed (J9305), docetaxel (J9170), paclitaxel (J9265), cisplatin (J9060, J9062,
and C9418), carboplatin (J9045), gemcitabine (J9201),
doxorubicin (J9000, J9001, Q2050, Q2048, J9002,
Q2049, and C9415), topotecan (J9350, J8705, and
J9351), etoposide (C9414, C9425, J8560, J9181, and
J9182), vincristine (J9370, J9375, and J9380), and cyclophosphamide (C9420,C9421, J8530, J9070, J9080,
J9090, J9091, J9092, J9093, J9094, J9095, J9096, and
J9097). The determination of whether a patient received
chemotherapy (yes vs no) was based on the data entry
from the chemotherapy procedure or administration
codes, whereas the specific chemotherapy agent was identified with the drug-specific codes in the claim files.
Patients with missing information were excluded from
specific analyses. In addition, we determined other treatment and supportive interventions such as radiation and
palliative care with the applicable codes in the procedure
and claims file.
Patient Selection

All patients coded with a diagnosis of SCLC in the SEERMedicare database between 1985 and 2005 were potentially eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Patients with a
cancer diagnosis in addition to SCLC were excluded to
eliminate a competing risk for the primary outcome and
also to prevent potential confounding factors arising from
the possible use of chemotherapy agents for a different
cancer indication. Also, patients with missing information
were excluded from specific analyses for which the missing
data were required for analysis. Before 1991, the SEERMedicare database collected general information on
chemotherapy treatment but not specific information on
the type of chemotherapy administered. Therefore,
patients diagnosed between 1985 and 1990 were excluded
from the analysis of the survival impact of specific chemotherapy agents.

Statistical Analysis

Patient outcomes with or without the receipt of chemotherapy were assessed across 4 different time intervals to
explore any temporal trend in chemotherapy use and the
effect of treatment on survival calculated from the time of
the initial diagnosis. The 1985-1990 interval period
served as a baseline for a temporal survival analysis conducted at approximately 5-year intervals (1985-1990,
1991-1995, 1996-2000, and 2001-2005).
The association between survival and chemotherapy
use overall (yes vs no) or the use of specific chemotherapy
agents commonly used as standard-of-care therapy for
SCLC (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, etoposide, carboplatin, cisplatin, topotecan, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine, and vinorelbine) was analyzed. Period
of diagnosis (1985-1990, 1991-1995, 1996-2000, or
2001-2005), age at diagnosis, sex, race (white, black,
Asian, Hispanic, or other), stage (IV vs other), Medicarequalifying event (aged vs other), urban/rural residence
(less urban/rural vs urban/metro), radiation (yes vs no),
and surgery (yes vs no) as predictors of clinical benefit
were also analyzed.
Differences in the characteristics (age, sex, race,
stage, radiation, surgery, defined treatment period, rural/
urban location, and Medicare status) of patients treated or
not treated with chemotherapy were tested with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, the chi-square test, or Fisher’s exact
test as appropriate. A multivariate analysis of chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was conducted by the inclusion of age, sex, race, stage, radiation, surgery, defined
treatment period, geographic location, and Medicare status in a logistic regression model and with a backward
variable selection method with an a level set at .1 for removal criteria. For the linear trend analysis, Cox proportional hazards models13 were used to estimate the adjusted
effect of chemotherapy on overall survival (OS) by the period of diagnosis after adjustments for age, sex, race, stage,
Medicare status, geographical location, and radiation. To
evaluate whether the observed survival improvement over
time was due to specific chemotherapy or to other factors,
we calculated the relative ratio of the hazard ratio (HR;
each HR divided by the HR of the preceding time interval), and this was followed by a P trend analysis to test for
statistical significance of the relative ratios. To better estimate the treatment effect on survival, a propensity score
analysis was used to adjust for any imbalances between the
treated and untreated groups. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to calculate the propensity scores of
chemotherapy use and each specific chemotherapy agent
after we had controlled for the year of diagnosis, age, sex,
52

race, stage, Medicare status, urban/rural location, and
radiation. A Cox proportional hazards model was then
used to assess the effect of specific interventions and/or
chemotherapy agents with the propensity score as a covariate. Survival functions were estimated with the KaplanMeier method for patients with and without the treatment
of interest along with a log-rank test.14
All analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and R 3.21 (R Foundation for
Statistical Computing) with a significance level of .05 set
for all tests.
RESULTS
Demographics

We identified 47,351 patients with a diagnosis of SCLC:
23,535 patients (49.7%) were treated with chemotherapy,
and 23,816 patients (50.3%) were not treated with chemotherapy. The median age of the whole population was 71
years. The eligible patients were mostly white (87%),
elderly with an age  65 years (84%), and male (52%).
The clinical and demographic characteristics of patients
treated and not treated with chemotherapy are shown in
Table 1 (see also Table 2).
Trends and Predictors of Chemotherapy Use in
SCLC Patients

The proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy
during the baseline period of 1985-1990 was very low at
only 38%. This proportion, however, increased significantly in the later time periods and reached 53% in the
2001-2005 period (38%, 55%, 50%, and 53%; P < .001;
Fig. 1A). There was variability in the rate of chemotherapy use across different racial groups, with the highest rate
noted in Asians (53.4%) versus blacks (47.5%), whites
(50.2%), and Hispanics (48.8%). Chemotherapy administration was higher for females versus males (50.9% vs
48.6%; P < .001). Also, there was a significant difference
in the proportions of treated and untreated patients
according to the Medicare-qualifying status; 50% of
patients who qualified for Medicare on the basis of age
received chemotherapy. Radiation use was higher in
patients treated with chemotherapy versus the untreated
group (57.7% vs 42%; P < .001). Radiation to the brain
or central nervous system (CNS) was given to approximately 10% of all patients who received radiation therapy.
Patients treated with chemotherapy were more likely to
receive radiation therapy to both CNS and non-CNS
sites. Chemotherapy utilization was lower in stage IV
patients versus patients at earlier stages (48.6% vs 54.5%;
P < .001).

A multivariate analysis identified years of diagnosis,
white race versus black or other race, female sex, Medicarequalifying status, early stages, rural residence, use of radiation, and younger age at diagnosis to be significantly
associated with treatment with systemic chemotherapy
agents (Table 3).
Survival Analysis

The median overall survival for all patients was 7.2 months,
with significantly better overall survival for patients treated
54

with chemotherapy versus untreated patients (9.6 vs 3.6
months, P < .001; Fig. 1B). An analysis limited to treated
patients showed no significant difference in survival
between patients treated with carboplatin regimens and
patients treated with cisplatin regimens (9.6 vs 8.4 months;
P 5 .775; Fig. 2A) or between those treated with platinum
(carboplatin or cisplatin) chemotherapy and those treated
with a non–platinum-containing regimen (10.8 vs 10.8
months; P 5 .237; Fig. 2B). In the chemotherapy-treated
group, patients treated with brain or CNS radiation had inferior survival in comparison with those receiving radiation
to non-CNS sites (HR, 1.21; confidence interval [CI],
1.13-1.29; P < .001).
Linear trend analyses across the defined 5-year intervals showed that survival was superior for patients treated
with chemotherapy versus untreated patients (HRs, 0.59,
0.61, 0.64, and 0.62 for 1985-1990, 1991-1995, 19962000, and 2001-2005, respectively; P < .001) after adjustments for significant predictors of chemotherapy use
(Table 4). When we compared survival trends within the
patient subgroup treated with chemotherapy, we observed
a significant improvement in survival over time (HRs, 1.0,
1.03, 1.00, and 0.96; P 5 .005; Table 5). Similar improvement was observed in the untreated patient subgroup
(HRs, 1.0, 0.99, 0.94, and 0.92; P < .001; Table 5).
Survival within racial subgroups showed that the
survival of blacks during each of the 4 defined time periods was modestly inferior to that of whites, whereas the
survival of Hispanics and Asians was modestly better than
that of whites (Table 6). Linear trend analyses of survival
by race across the 5-year intervals with white patients as

Propensity Score–Adjusted Survival Analysis

To establish the benefit of chemotherapy with comparable
treated and untreated patients, survival comparisons were
conducted with propensity score–adjusted analyses, which
allowed us to limit the confounding effects of patientrelated prognostic factors such as comorbid illnesses that
could influence both the decision to administer systemic
therapy and the overall patient outcome. Propensity
score–adjusted analyses confirmed the superior survival of
patients treated with each of the systemic therapy agents
currently used in the real-world setting in comparison

with untreated patients (P < .001; Table 7). In addition,
there was no significant survival difference between
patients treated with carboplatin and patients treated with
cisplatin (HR, 0.99; CI, 0.81-1.19; P 5 .875) and
between patients treated with a platinum agent and
patients treated with non–platinum-containing regimens
(HR, 0.98; CI, 0.86-1.12; P 5 .766). The use of topotecan increased significantly over time (P < .001; Table 8).
Patients treated with topotecan as salvage therapy had better survival than patients treated with paclitaxel (HR, 0.6;
CI, 0.43-0.82; P 5 .001). Patients receiving second-line
therapy in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy had
survival superior to that of patients who received only
platinum-based chemotherapy (HR, 0.78; CI, 0.75-0.81;
P < .001). The result was consistent when we limited this

analysis to patients treated with cisplatin (HR, 0.68; CI,

of chemotherapy agent had survival inferior to that of
patients who received 2 or more types of chemotherapy
agents (HRs, 0.88, 0.86, and 0.83; P < .001; Table 9).

DISCUSSION
We analyzed the quality-assured Medicare-SEER database
to determine the trends in the use of Food and Drug
Administration–approved systemic chemotherapy agents
for the treatment of SCLC patients in the United States.
Our analysis included data from more than 47,000
patients diagnosed between 1985 and 2005. The majority
of the patients (84%) were 65 years or older. This was in
part due to the fact that our study population consisted of
Medicare-eligible patients, the majority of whom were
qualified by age. Nonetheless, the age distribution was not
too dissimilar to the age distribution of the general lung
cancer patient population, for which the median age at diagnosis is 65 to 70 years.
Similarly to prior reports from our group and
others,15,16 approximately 50% of the patients did not
receive any systemic treatment. This proportion was
higher than the rate observed for non–small cell lung cancer patients, among whom approximately one-third were
not treated.15 Although we could not specifically define
the factors responsible for this low rate of chemotherapy
usage in SCLC, we can reasonably speculate that SCLC
patients are generally sicker and may suffer from other
tobacco-related disease that compromises their suitability

for active therapy. Moreover, the general nihilism associated with SCLC as an incurable cancer by medical oncologists and other physicians could also have contributed to
this low rate of chemotherapy usage. It is reassuring that
the rate of chemotherapy use in this population seems to
have increased in the more recent period covered by our
study versus the baseline period. Although the higher rate
of usage in younger patients, Asians, and female patients
is consistent with prior reports,17 the higher rate of chemotherapy use in rural patients versus urban/metro patients
is an intriguing observation that is not easily explained
and deserves to be further studied. One possible reason for
this disparity may be the increased likelihood of rural
patients to die in an acute hospital setting, which is in part
due to limited access to appropriate end-of-life palliative
care programs in rural communities.18,19
The efficacy of platinum agents and topotecan is supported by data from prospective, randomized, phase 3 studies.20-22 We observed a greater than 10-fold increase in the
proportion of patients treated with topotecan in the late
1990s and early 2000s versus the early 1990s. This uptick
in topotecan use coincided with published data for the efficacy of topotecan in patients with relapsed SCLC and with
the subsequent approval by the Food and Drug Administration.23,24 These data suggest that clinical trial results are
58

a strong driver of the adoption of new therapies in the real
world. Various other agents used for the treatment of
SCLC, especially in the salvage setting, were adopted on
the basis of limited evidence generally adduced from small
phase 2 studies.25 The demonstration in this study that
agents such as paclitaxel, docetaxel, and gemcitabine confer
a survival advantage in the real world is, therefore, important and provides additional support for this strategy,
which is part of current treatment guidelines. In agreement
with data from clinical trials, we did not observe any survival difference between patients treated with a platinumcontaining chemotherapy and those treated with nonplatinum regimens such as cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, and
vincristine chemotherapy.22 Although there has been no
prospective comparative study of cisplatin versus carboplatin in SCLC, a meta-analysis of data from prospective clinical trials of non–small cell lung cancer showed that the 2
agents are comparable in terms of survival.26,27 The comparable survival with carboplatin and cisplatin observed in
our study provides additional validation for the idea that either of these agents is appropriate for the treatment of
SCLC patients.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest and
most comprehensive study of the clinical benefit of chemotherapy in SCLC patients treated in a real-world setting.

Although these findings are relevant for patient management and future research, several limitations need to be
acknowledged and given adequate consideration. The retrospective nature of the analysis is an important drawback
because of the inability to fully control for important
prognostic variables such as comorbidities, overall disease
burden, and performance status between the comparator
groups. This weakness is somewhat ameliorated by the
replication of the survival benefit associated with chemotherapy in propensity-matched patient subgroups. Also,
the 5-year periods defined for trend analysis were arbitrarily chosen without any recourse to specific shifts in
management paradigms. Because there were no newly
available agents corresponding to the temporal periods,
the improved outcome over time probably reflected both
increased use of chemotherapy and potential improvements in supportive care over time. The improved survival
over time within the treated and untreated patient subgroups as well as the slight reduction in the benefit of
chemotherapy when treated patients were compared with
untreated patients provides further indirect support for
this assertion. Finally, the use of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) for SCLC became an established intervention during the latter part of the period covered by this
study.28 It is conceivable that patients treated with chemotherapy also received PCI, which could have magnified
the potential benefit of systemic therapy. Indeed, patients
treated with chemotherapy in this population were more
likely to also receive radiation to the CNS (54% vs 46%).
However, we were unable to establish whether the CNS
radiation was prophylactic or for established brain metastasis. We observed inferior survival in chemotherapytreated patients who also received CNS radiation.
In conclusion, we observed a clinical benefit of
chemotherapy in SCLC patients treated in the real world.
Both platinum-containing chemotherapy and salvage
chemotherapy were associated with a survival benefit.
Although the overall rate of chemotherapy use was very
low, we observed a modest but significant increase in the
proportion of patients treated with chemotherapy over
time.
