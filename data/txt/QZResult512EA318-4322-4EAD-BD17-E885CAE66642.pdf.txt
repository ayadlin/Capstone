Abstract
Currently, the most efficacious treatment for malignant
gliomas is temozolomide; however, gliomas expressing the
DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase
(MGMT) are resistant to this drug. Strong clinical evidence
shows that gliomas with methylation and subsequent silencing
of the MGMT promoter are sensitive to temozolomide. Based
on the fact that adenoviral proteins directly target and
inactivate key DNA repair genes, we hypothesized that the
oncolytic adenovirus #-24-RGD could be successfully combined with temozolomide to overcome the reported MGMTmediated resistance. Our studies showed that the combination
of #-24-RGD and temozolomide induces a profound therapeutic synergy in glioma cells. We observed that #-24-RGD
treatment overrides the temozolomide-mediated G2-M arrest.
Furthermore, #-24-RGD infection was followed by downmodulation of the RNA levels of MGMT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that #-24-RGD prevented the
recruitment of p300 to the MGMT promoter. Importantly,
using mutant adenoviruses and wild-type and dominantnegative forms of the p300 protein, we showed that #-24-RGD
interaction with p300 was required to induce silencing of the
MGMT gene. Of further clinical relevance, the combination of
#-24-RGD and temozolomide significantly improved the
survival of glioma-bearing mice. Collectively, our data provide
a strong mechanistic rationale for the combination of
oncolytic adenoviruses and temozolomide, and should propel
the clinical testing of this therapy approach in patients with
malignant gliomas. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):11499–504]

Introduction
At the moment, temozolomide is the mainstay of treatment for
glioblastomas (1). However, a phase 3 evaluation of temozolomide
combined with radiotherapy for newly diagnosed gliomas showed
that the expression of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine
DNA methyltransferase (MGMT; ref. 2) rendered these tumors
resistant to temozolomide (3). D-24-RGD is an oncolytic adenovirus
that harbors a 24-bp deletion in the E1A region responsible for
binding Rb protein (4) and presents enhanced infectivity due to the
addition of an RGD-4C motif in the fiber HI loop (5). D-24-RGD has
proven to be highly effective against mice bearing glioma xenoRequests for reprints: Marta M. Alonso, Department of Neuro-Oncology, Unit 1002,

grafts and is currently awaiting clinical trial evaluation. Because
each of the new pharmacologic and oncolytic viral therapies tested
in gliomas shows no toxicity but generates only partial responses,
glioblastoma treatment currently requires multimodal therapy.
Interestingly, adenoviral proteins directly target key DNA repair
genes in order to replicate efficiently (6, 7). We hypothesized that
the combination of the oncolytic adenovirus D-24-RGD and temozolomide would effectively overcome MGMT-mediated chemoresistance.

Materials and Methods
Animal studies. U87 MG human glioma cells (5  105) were engrafted
into the caudate nucleus of athymic mice using a guide-screw system as
previously described (8). Mice received a single intratumoral injection (day 3
postimplantation) of D-24-RGD (107 plaque-forming units/animal). Temozolomide was given at 7.5 mg/kg during 5 days.
Immunohistochemical analysis. The paraffin-embedded sections of
the mice brains were immunostained for antibodies specific for adenoviral
E1A (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and hexon (Chemicon International, Inc.)
proteins following conventional procedures.
Cell lines and culture conditions. The glioma cell lines U87 MG and
T98G were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Both cell
lines were maintained in DMEM/F12 (1:1, vol/vol) supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2 at 37jC.
Adenovirus construction and infection. Construction of D-24-RGD
and viral infection has been previously described (5, 9).
Cell viability assay. U87 MG or T98G cells were seeded at a density of
5  103 cells per well in 96-well plates, and the next day, cells were infected
with D-24-RGD or UV-inactivated (UVi) at multiplicities of infection (MOI)
of 0.1, 1, and 5. In addition, cells were treated with temozolomide at a
concentration ranging from 0.01 to 1,000 Amol/L. Cell viability was assessed
7 days later using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (Sigma-Aldrich), as previously described (10). Dose-response
curves were analyzed using CalcuSyn Software (Biosoft). CalcuSyn fits the
dose-response curves to Chou-Talalay lines (11). IC50 is the median-effect
dose (the dose causing 50% of cells to be affected, i.e., 50% survival). After
fitting the combined dose-response curve from a single representative
experiment to a Chou-Talalay line, Chou-Talalay combination indices (CI)
were calculated (12). A mean CI was calculated from data points with the
fraction of cells affected at > 0.5 (13).
Immunoblotting. U87 MG and T98G cells were plated and 24 h later
infected with D-24-RGD (10 MOI for U87 MG cells and 25 MOI for T98G
cells) alone or in combination with temozolomide (100 Amol/L for U87 MG
cells and 300 Amol/L for T98G cells). Cells were harvested 36 h after the
infection, and proteins were extracted and separated in a 10% SDS-PAGE,
and the membranes were probed with antibodies for E1A (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology) and fiber (NeoMarkers).
Viral replication assay. The tissue culture infection dose replication
assay (TCID50) method was used to determine the final viral titration, as
previously described (5). Final titers were determined as plaque-forming
units, using the validation method developed by Quantum Biotechnology.

glioma xenografts treated with the combination of D-24-RGD and temozolomide (from two independent experiments). The animals were randomly distributed into
four groups that received the following treatments: UViD24R and PBS (PBS ), UViD24R and temozolomide (TMZ ), D24R and PBS (D24R ), and D24R and
temozolomide (D24R/TMZ ). Mice received a single intratumoral injection (day 3 postimplantation) of D24R (107 plaque-forming units/animal), and temozolomide was
given i.p. at 7.5 mg/kg over 5 d. The P values in the plot were determined by the log-rank test and represent a comparison of every treatment group with that
of PBS. C, hexon immunostaining of the brains of animals treated with D-24-RGD alone or in combination with temozolomide that were sacrificed 25 d after
implantation. Representative photomicrographs of three animals (magnification, 200).

Cell cycle analysis. Cell cycle phase distribution was analyzed by
measuring DNA content. Cell samples were collected at different time
points after infection of U87 MG or T98G cells with D-24-RGD (10 MOI)
and/or treatment with temozolomide (100 Amol/L).
Alkaline comet assay. Cells were plated and the next day treated with
D-24-RGD (10 and 25 MOI for U87 MG and T98G cells, respectively) and/or
temozolomide (100 or 300 Amol/L for U87 MG and T98G cells, respectively).
Cells were harvested 48 h after treatment, and DNA damage was quantified
using the alkaline comet assay kit (Trevigen, Inc.). Data are shown as the
percentage of comet tails found per treatment (n = 500 cells per treatment).
Reverse transcriptase-PCR and RT quantitative-PCR. U87 MG and
T98G cells were treated with temozolomide (100 or 300 Amol/L for U87 MG
and T98G cells, respectively), D-24-RGD (10 and 25 MOI for U87 MG and
T98G cells, respectively), D39 (50 MOI), p300 (50 MOI), or AdTL2 (50 MOI)
alone or in combination as indicated. Cells were collected 48 h after
infection, and RNA was extracted using RNeasy (Qiagen) following the
manufacturer’s directions and subjected to reverse transcription-PCR (RTPCR) and RT-quantitative (RT-QPCR). MGMT mRNA was amplified using
the same primers for both types of PCR and are published elsewhere (14).
In both cases, input RNA was normalized with the amplification of
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase RNA. Reaction products for the

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

RT-PCR were resolved on 2% agarose gel. QPCR analysis was performed on
a Chromo 4 sequence detection system (Bio-Rad). To determine relative
gene expression, the comparative threshold cycle method was used (15).
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Cells were treated with the
indicated single or combined treatments. The chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) assays were performed using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell lysates were collected 24 and 48 h after
infection and immunoprecipitated with p300 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). MGMT promoter primers have been described elsewhere (16).
Statistical analysis. For the in vitro experiments, statistical analyses
were performed using a two-tailed Student’s t test. Data are expressed as
mean F SD. The in vivo cytopathic effect of D-24-RGD on human glioma
xenografts was assessed by plotting survival curves according to the
Kaplan-Meier method. Survival in different treatment groups was compared
using the log-rank test. The P values for pair-wise comparisons were
calculated using the Bonferroni method.

Results and Discussion
We assessed the antiglioma efficacy of D-24-RGD plus temozolomide in vivo using an orthotopic model of human glioma

Figure 2. Characterization of the anticancer effect of the combination of temozolomide and D-24-RGD in gliomas. A, examination of the cytopathic effect of
temozolomide alone or in combination with D-24-RGD. Cells were seeded at a density of 5  103 cells per well in 96-well plates. The next day, the cells were
infected with D24R at a MOI of 0.1, 1, or 5 or UViD24R at a MOI of 5. Cells were treated with temozolomide at a concentration ranging from 0 to 2  103 Amol/L.
Cell viability was assessed 7 d later. Points, mean of three independent experiments represented as cell viability relative to cells treated with UViD24R and

at a density of 5  103 cells per well in 96-well plates and the next day were infected with D-24-RGD at MOI of 0.1, 1, or 5 or with UVi-D-24-RGD at 5 MOI.
Where indicated, cells were treated with temozolomide at a concentration ranging from 0 to 2  103 Amol/L. Cell viability was assessed 7 d later using
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. IC50 is the median-effect dose (the dose causing 50% of cells to be affected, i.e., 50% survival).
C, interaction between temozolomide and D-24-RGD in glioma cell lines. The range of CI corresponds with the different doses tested. Interaction was measured
by combination index values. Combination index values >1.3 indicated antagonism, values between 1.1 and 1.3 indicated moderate antagonism, values between 0.9
and 1.1 indicated additivity, values between 0.8 and 0.9 indicated slight synergy, values between 0.6 and 0.8 indicated moderate synergy, values between 0.4
and 0.6 indicated synergy, and values <0.4 indicated strong synergy. Each combination was studied in three independent experiments, the differences of which
were not statistically significant. Results of single experiments are shown. D24R, D-24-RGD; UViD24R, UV-inactivated D-24-RGD; TMZ, temozolomide; ND,

xenograft in immunocompromised mice. The median survival
duration for animals treated with PBS in two independent studies
was 30 and 35 days, respectively. Treatment with temozolomide
alone extended the survival duration to a median 38 and 33.6 days,
respectively. A single dose of D-24-RGD administered in combination with temozolomide significantly prolonged the survival of
these mice in comparison to animals treated with D-24-RGD alone
(P = 0.05, log-rank test for both experiments). Moreover, 50% of
D-24-RGD–treated mice were alive 50 days after tumor implantation. Importantly, 90% of the animals treated with the D-24-RGD/
temozolomide combination were alive at the end of both experiments (Fig. 1A and B). Next, we asked whether viral replication
was impaired by the drug effect. To this end, three additional
animals from each group were sacrificed 25 days after the treatment started. Animals treated with D-24-RGD and temozolomide
showed hexon expression levels indicating that viral replication
capability was not compromised in the presence of temozolomide
(Fig. 1C).
These in vivo data strongly suggest that the antitumoral effect
exhibited by the tandem adenovirus/chemotherapy modality was
more than simple additivity. To confirm the potential synergy
between D-24-RGD and temozolomide, we first quantified the
anticancer effect of the combination of these agents in U87 MG and
T98G glioma cells. We showed that the median-effect doses (IC50 =
dose causing 50% of survival) of D-24-RGD were 0.57 and 4.93 MOI
in U87 MG and T98G cells, respectively, and that the IC50 of

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (24). December 15, 2007

temozolomide was 204 and 1,585 Amol/L in U87 MG and T98G
cells, respectively. Importantly, we observed a decrease of between
three and five orders of magnitude in the IC50 of the drug in
the combination treatment in both cell lines (Fig. 2A and B). The
analysis of the combination index values showed that the
association between temozolomide and D-24-RGD globally resulted
in a profound synergistic effect in both glioma cell lines (Fig. 2C).
Because temozolomide did not increase adenoviral replication
(Fig. 2D), we next asked whether D-24-RGD overcomes chemoresistance to temozolomide. Because cell cycle arrest in G2-M
phase renders cells more resistant to temozolomide (17), we
analyzed the cell cycle profile of U87 MG and T98G cells treated
with temozolomide alone and in combination with D-24-RGD
(Fig. 3A). We observed that temozolomide treatment induced G2-M
arrest but that the addition of D-24-RGD was sufficient to override
this arrest and resulted in over-representation of the S phase
populations of U87 MG and T98G cells (60.8 F 5.7%, P < 0.05 and
53 F 95%; CI, 7.2, P < 0.005, respectively). Because the G2-M arrest
as well as the cytotoxic mechanism of temozolomide are related to
the induction of DNA damage (18), we next used the alkaline comet
assay to determine whether the D-24-RGD infection results in
the impairment of DNA repair. We showed that T98G was less
susceptible than U87 MG to temozolomide-induced DNA damage
(24.1 F 3.9% and 60.2 F 4.2%, respectively); however, the percentage of T98G and U87 MG cells with comet tails increased
significantly in cells treated with D-24-RGD and temozolomide

(80.1 F 3%, P < 0.0001 in T98G, and 98.2 F 6%, P < 0.0001 in U87
MG; Fig. 3B). These results suggest that the adenovirus-mediated
abrogation of cell cycle arrest might hinder the extra allocation of
time provided by the temozolomide-induced arrest that allows the
DNA repair machinery to reverse the cytotoxic effect of the drug
(17), thus eventually speeding the process of cell death.
It has been proven that the expression of MGMT in cancer cells
creates a resistant phenotype by blunting the therapeutic effect of
temozolomide in patients with glioblastoma (3). Therefore, we
evaluated the role of MGMT expression in the resistance of U87
MG and T98G cells to temozolomide. We showed that the two cell
lines expressed different levels of MGMT (Fig. 4A), with U87 MG
cells expressing low basal levels of MGMT (due to partial methylation of the promoter) and T98G cells expressing high basal levels
of MGMT (promoter is wild-type). Importantly, these differences
were consistent with both sensitivity to temozolomide (Fig. 2A)
and with the extent of DNA damage induced by temozolomide
(Fig. 3B).
Because the adenovirus E1A protein binds to and inactivates
CBP/p300 and by doing so strongly inhibits MGMT promoter
activity (16), we assessed MGMT expression after treatment with
D-24-RGD alone and in combination. As expected, temozolomide
treatment induced the expression of MGMT in U87 MG and T98G
cells (Fig. 4A). However, D-24-RGD treatment was followed by a
drastic down-modulation of MGMT transcript in both glioma cell
lines treated with temozolomide (Fig. 4A), suggesting a critical role

of p300 in these phenomena. Overexpression of p300 resulted in the
up-regulation of MGMT levels in control-infected cells (>30-fold in
U87 MG cells and >10-fold in T98G cells). The p300-mediated upregulation of MGMT was drastically counteracted by D-24-RGD,
with the levels of MGMT returning to basal levels in cells treated
with both D-24-RGD and the adenoviral vector expressing p300.
Further experiments confirmed that the expression of a dominantnegative form of p300 down-modulated the basal levels of MGMT
(Fig. 4A). Accordingly, we showed that infection of cancer cells with
a mutant E1A adenovirus (D-39; ref. 19) unable to bind to and
inactivate p300 did not modify the level of expression of MGMT
(Fig. 4A). Together, these data indicated that D-24-RGD downmodulates MGMT by means of the E1A binding to and inactivation
of p300. To directly examine the effect of the physical interaction of
the E1A/p300 complex with the promoter of MGMT, we performed
ChIP assays. We showed that 24 h after treatment with temozolomide as single treatment or with D-24-RGD, p300 became a
component of the protein complex recruited to the MGMT promoter in glioma cells (Fig. 4B). However, the recruitment of p300
to the MGMT promoter was disrupted 48 h after the infection in
cells treated with D-24-RGD plus temozolomide (Fig. 2B). Our data
therefore indicate that adenoviral infection is followed by E1Amediated removal of p300 from the MGMT transcriptional
machinery leading to silencing of the MGMT promoter.
Other oncolytic systems have been successfully combined
with temozolomide (14, 20). Interestingly, herpes simplex virus

replication benefits from the increase in the DNA damage repair
machinery function triggered by the temozolomide treatment;
meanwhile, adenoviruses need to shut down this machinery to
achieve an effective replication.
In summary, our results indicate a synergistic therapeutic role
between D-24-RGD and temozolomide. This work also underscores
the dominant role of MGMT expression in modulating resistance to
temozolomide, to date, the most active brain tumor chemotherapy.
Our study suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting molecular
regulation of MGMT enhances the temozolomide anticancer effect
and thus link clinical observations with feasible avenues of therapy.
This study also provides a preliminary rationale for a logical continuation of the imminent phase I clinical trial of D-24-RGD in
patients with recurrent glioblastoma by proposing testing in the
