ABSTRACT:
c-Met is a tyrosine receptor kinase which is activated by its ligand, the hepatocyte
growth factor. Activation of c-Met leads to a wide spectrum of biological activities
such as motility, angiogenesis, morphogenesis, cell survival and cell regeneration.
c-Met is abnormally activated in many tumour types. Aberrant c-Met activation was
found to induce tumour development, tumour cell migration and invasion, and the
worst and final step in cancer progression, metastasis. In addition, c-Met activation
in cells was also shown to confer resistance to apoptosis induced by UV damage
or chemotherapeutic drugs. This study describes the development of monoclonal
antibodies against c-Met as therapeutic molecules in cancer treatment/diagnostics.
A panel of c-Met monoclonal antibodies was developed and characterised by epitope
mapping, Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, agonist/antagonist effect in cell
scatter assays and for their ability to recognise native c-Met by flow cytometry. We
refer to these antibodies as Specifically Engaging Extracellular c-Met (seeMet). seeMet
2 and 13 bound strongly to native c-Met in flow cytometry and reduced SNU-5 cell
growth. Interestingly, seeMet 2 binding was strongly reduced at 4oC when compared
to 37oC. Detail mapping of the seeMet 2 epitope indicated a cryptic binding site hidden
within the c-Met α-chain.

INTRODUCTION

domain, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic
domain. The extracellular portion of the β-chain makes
up the remainder of the sema domain. The cytoplasmic
portion of c-Met β-chain contains the juxtamembrane
region followed by a kinase domain and a carboxylterminal tail. The carboxyl-terminal tail is essential for
c-Met downstream signaling as it contains the docking
site for signaling and adapter proteins that bind to c-Met.
Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is the only
known c-Met ligand. Upon HGF binding, c-Met
receptor dimerises on the cell surface which results in
autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues (Y1230, Y1234
and Y1235) in the kinase domain. Autophosphorylation of
Y1234 and Y1235 is thought to induce a conformational
change in c-Met, exposing the docking site

c-Met is a 190 kD tyrosine kinase receptor made up
of an extracellular α-chain which is linked by a disulphide
bond to a transmembrane β-chain. c-Met is synthesised
as a 170 kD single polypeptide that is proteolytically
cleaved to form the α-chain and the β-chain [1]. The
mature α-chain is 45 kD and constitutes part of the
sema domain. The sema domain is a conserved domain
shared by semaphorins and plexins. This domain adopts a
seven-bladed beta-propeller structure which is important
for homo-dimerisation. In c-Met, both the α-chain and
the β-chain form the sema domain that is necessary and
sufficient for receptor dimerisation and ligand binding [2].
The 140 kD mature β-chain consists of an extracellular

(Y1349VNVXXXY1356VHV) in the carboxyl-terminal tail of
c-Met [3]. This results in transphosphorylation of tyrosine
residues (Y1349 and Y1356) in the c-Met docking site.
The docking site becomes available for recruitment of
adaptor and signalling molecules resulting in the activation
of various signalling pathways including the AKT/PI3K,
RAS/MAPK and STAT pathways [3].
Aberrant c-Met activation of c-Met signalling
pathways correlates with hyperproliferation, tumour
cell invasion, tumour angiogenesis and poor prognosis
in various human cancers. In addition, c-Met signalling
protects the tumour cell by inhibiting apoptosis and
inducing resistance towards cancer therapy, thus
hampering the efforts of tumour treatment. c-Met as a
cancer prognosis marker and its involvement in cancer
metastasis and drug resistance makes c-Met a very
attractive drug target. Many antibodies targeting tyrosine
kinase receptors such as Herceptin (clinically known
as Trastuzamab), have been successful in the clinic.
Herceptin is a chimeric antibody targeted against the
tyrosine receptor kinase HER2, used for breast cancer
treatment. With the success of therapeutic antibodies,
attempts have been made to develop therapeutic antibodies
against the Met-HGF axis. Neutralising antibodies targeted
against HGF aimed to block Met-HGF interaction were
developed. c-Met binding to HGF was only blocked when
a combination of three different anti-HGF antibodies
were used [4]. Similarly, van der Horst et al. [5] reported
the combination of using two fully human anti-Met
antibodies (R13 and R28) was more effective in inhibiting
c-Met binding to HGF as compared to using R13 or R28
alone. Burgess et al. [6] developed five fully human antiHGF antibodies targeted against the β-chain of HGF.
These antibodies were successful in blocking Met-HGF
interaction in U-87MG glioblastoma cells.
Developing therapeutic bivalent antibodies targeted
against c-Met has been challenging. Prat et al. [7]
developed two monoclonal antibodies (DO-24 and DN-30)
against the extracellular domain of c-Met. Interestingly,
both monoclonal antibodies act as an agonist rather than
an antagonist and activate c-Met signaling in vivo. It is
hypothesised that the bivalent binding of an antibody
could mimic the dimerising effect of HGF, thus causing
c-Met dimerisation upon antibody binding. To avoid c-Met
activation by bivalent monoclonal antibodies, Pacchiana
et al. [8] engineered the DN-30 Fab fragment. DN30 Fab retained its high binding affinity towards c-Met
but lost its agonist activity towards c-Met. DN-30 Fab
efficiently inhibited c-Met signaling by causing c-Met
ectodomain shedding and receptor down regulation [8].
The one-arm 5D5 antibody (MetMab or clinically known
as Onartuzumab) is a monovalent chimeric antibody
targeted against c-Met developed by Genetech [9]. Like
DN-30, bivalent 5D5 antibody became an antagonist when
converted to a monovalent Fab [10]. In contrast to Fab
DN-30, MetMab acts as an antagonist by competing with
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

HGF for c-Met binding and causes c-Met internalisation
and down-regulation [10]. Recently, Greenall et al. [11]
was the first to report bivalent anti-Met monoclonal
antibodies that are not agonists. LMH 87 antibody, that
targets the α-chain of c-Met, was shown to cause c-Met
down-regulation by receptor internalisation.
This study describes the development of a panel of
bivalent anti-Met murine monoclonal antibodies. These
antibodies were raised against the α-chain of human
c-Met and are termed Specifically Engaging Extracellular
c-Met (seeMet). seeMet antibodies were characterised by
Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry,
epitope mapping and agonist/antagonist activity towards
c-Met. Surprisingly, none of these antibodies were c-Met
agonists. Two antibodies, seeMet 2 and 13, showed the
strongest binding to native c-Met by flow cytometry but
work poorly to detect denatured c-Met on Western blots.
In contrast seeMet 11 and seeMet 12 antibodies showed
outstanding specificity in Western blot analysis. seeMet 2
was the most effective in reducing cell division. Further
analysis of seeMet 2 on flow cytometry showed that its
binding to c-Met on live cells is temperature sensitive.
Detailed mapping of seeMet 2 epitope revealed that part
of seeMet 2 epitope is buried within the reported native
crystal structure of c-Met.

RESULTS
Development and initial characterisation of
seeMet antibodies
The α-chain of human c-Met was prokaryotically
expressed and purified. Purified α-chain was used to
immunise BALB/c mice. To obtain hybridoma cells
producing anti-α-chain c-Met antibodies, the spleen
cells of immunised mice were fused with SP2./0-Ag14
cells. Hybridoma cells were single-cell cloned and cell
supernatant from monoclonal hybridoma clones were
screened for anti-α-chain c-Met reactivity mainly by
Western blotting and cell staining. Post primary and
secondary antibody screening (Supplementary Figure 1),
a panel of 21 seeMet antibodies were selected for isotype
characterisation and epitope mapping. Antibody isotyping
was performed by dipping commercially-available
isotyping strips into monoclonal hybridoma supernatant.
All 21 monoclonal antibodies share the same IgG isotype
(but not the same subclass) and kappa light chain (Table
1).
Epitope mapping of the 21 seeMet monoclonal
antibodies was determined by an ELISA-based assay
(Pepscan). Consecutive, overlapping synthetic peptides
that span the entire c-Met α-chain were biotinylated
and added to strepatvidin-coated plates. Antibody was
then added to the peptides and binding was determined

colorimetrically. In total, 10 different antibody binding
regions from the α-chain were identified from the 21
monoclonal cell supernatants tested, indicating that
there is no one main region that is highly immunogenic.
A simplified diagram of the antibody binding regions
on c-Met α-chain is shown in Figure 1A. The antibody
binding regions were also mapped onto the crystal
structure of c-Met, PDB accession number 1SHY (Figure
1B & C). The results of initial antibody characterisation
are summarised in Table 1.

to the heavy (~51 kD) and light (~25 kD) chain of an
antibody, no other protein bands were observed in the
Coomassie-stained gel, suggesting that the purification of
monoclonal antibodies was successful.
To ensure that the monoclonal antibodies
retained their anti-α-chain activity after production
and purification, purified monoclonal antibodies were
characterised by Western blotting (Figure 2). 1 μg/mL
of purified monoclonal antibodies was used to detect
purified c-Met α-chain, c-Met expressed after transfection
of NIH3T3 cells and endogenous c-Met in U-87MG
cells. All monoclonal antibodies, except seeMet 13 and
15, successfully detected purified c-Met α-chain, and
transfected as well as endogenous human c-Met. seeMet
13 and 15 had low specificity towards c-Met. seeMet 2 and
14 were observed to have higher affinity towards c-Met,
compared to seeMet 13 and 15. seeMet 4, 8, 16, 17 and 18
have higher affinity towards c-Met and fewer non-specific
bands compared to seeMet 2, 13, 14 and 15. Despite
recognising different epitopes (Figure 1A), most of the
seeMet monoclonal antibodies share the same pattern of
band recognition with seeMet 11 and 12. This suggests
that the band profiles of seeMet 11 and 12 are completely

Further characterisation of purified seeMet
monoclonal antibodies
From the panel of 21 seeMet monoclonal
antibodies, 11 antibodies were selected for production and
purification. Purified antibodies were further characterised
by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry,
and agonist/antagonist activity by cell scattering.
seeMet monoclonal antibodies were purified using
protein A beads. Purified antibody was resolved on a SDSPAGE gel and stained with Coomassie blue dye (data not
shown). Other than the expected two bands corresponding

specific. seeMet 11 and 12 are thus the best monoclonal
antibodies to use on Western blots as they detected c-Met
with good affinity and specificity. Horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) was conjugated to seeMet 12 (seeMet 12-HRP) and
used as a tool in this study for detecting precursor c-Met
and mature c-Met α-chain.
To further characterise the monoclonal antibodies
reactivity against c-Met α-chain, the antibodies were used
to immunoprecipitate endogenous c-Met from SNU-5 cell
lysate. SNU-5 is a human gastric cell line that expresses
high levels of c-Met. Immunoprecipitated cell lysates
were analysed by Western blotting (Figure 3) using the
commercial SC-10 and AF276 antibody. Although SC-10
and AF276 antibodies are raised against different regions
of c-Met, both SC-10 and AF276 share similar Western
blot band profiles. Most of our monoclonal antibodies
successfully immunoprecipitated the 170 kD precursor

c-Met (α- and β- chain linked together). Interestingly, a
145 kD protein band, which corresponds to the mature
c-Met β-chain, was also observed on the Western blot,
suggesting that the c-Met β-chain was pulled down
together with its α-chain. In order to ensure that mature
α-chain was immunoprecipitated, seeMet 12-HRP
(developed from this screen) was used to analyse the same
immunoprecipitated SNU-5 cell lysate on Western blots.
seeMet 8 and 18, which was also developed in this screen,
were conjugated to HRP and also used to detect c-Met
α-chain. seeMet 8, 12 and 18 recognise different epitopes
on c-Met (Figure 1A) but all successfully detected mature
c-Met α-chain and precursor c-Met strongly (Figure 3).
Flow cytometry was used to determine if our
monoclonal antibodies could bind to native c-Met on
live cells. SNU-5 cells were incubated with 1 µg/mL of
monoclonal antibody. Binding of seeMet monoclonal

assay, was used to determine the binding region of 21 monoclonal hybridoma supernatants. Consecutive overlapping peptides that span the
entire c-Met α-chain were synthesised and coated in 96-wells. To determine the region of antibody binding on the α-chain, monoclonal cell
supernatants were added to each peptide. Antibody binding results in a colourmetric reaction which is analysed by absorbance reading at
450 nM. The epitope of the antibodies were categorised into regions. Antibodies that share the same binding region are indicated. Figure not

Cell scattering is one of the biological hallmarks of
c-Met activation. Agonist bivalent monoclonal antibodies
targeting c-Met would activate c-Met and cause cells to
become motile and disperse. Here, we examine the effects
of purified seeMet monoclonal antibodies on cell scatter.
HaCaT cells were seeded at low density and allowed to
grow until colonies formed. Cells were serum-starved
for 24 hrs before incubating with 1 μg/mL of monoclonal
antibodies for 24 hrs. Cells were then fixed and stained
with crystal violet. As a control, cell scatter of HaCaT
cells was induced with 10 ng/mL of HGF (Figure 5). The
presence of non-specific IgG (mouse IgG) did not affect
scattering. Anti-HGF antibody and SU11274 were used as
controls. SU11274 is a small molecule inhibitor of c-Met.
Anti-HGF and SU11274-treated cell colonies remained
circular. No cell scatter was observed in cells treated with
monoclonal antibodies alone (Figure 5). This suggests that
the monoclonal antibodies are not agonist towards c-Met
activated cell scatter.

antibodies to native c-Met expressed on the cell surface
of SNU-5 cells was detected using anti-mouse secondary
antibody conjugated with FITC dye. T47D, a human
breast cancer cell line expressing low levels of c-Met, was
used in this assay to determine if the antibodies bind nonspecifically to the cell surface. The flow cytometry results
of purified monoclonal antibody treated T47D cells were
indistinguishable from the negative control (secondary
antibody only), indicating that monoclonal antibodies
do not bind non-specifically to the cell surface (data not
shown). Flow cytometry results obtained with SNU-5 cells
showed that the antibodies fell into three distinct groups
with different fluorescence intensity towards native c-Met:
strong fluorescence intensity, intermediate fluorescence
intensity and weak fluorescence intensity (Figure 4).
seeMet 2 and 13 showed the strongest fluorescence
intensity in this assay. Surprisingly, these antibodies
showed poor affinity for c-Met by Western blotting.
seeMet 8 and 17 showed intermediate fluorescence
intensity while seeMet 4, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16 and 18 showed
weak fluorescence intensity (as demonstrated by the small
peak shift).

seeMet 2 and 13 reduce cell growth in SNU-5 cells

(Figure 7A). Blocking cell division would result in the
apparent reduction of cell viability in the CellTiter-Glo®
assay which measures ATP concentration and a reduction
in the background levels of caspase activation in seeMet 2
and 13 treated cells.
To further demonstrate the effects of seeMet
monoclonal antibody on cell growth, SNU-5 cells were
pre-stained with the CellTracker green BODIPY dye
before antibody treatment. CellTracker BODIPY dye is a
membrane permeable dye that enters cells freely. Once in
the cell, the dye is converted to a membrane impermeable
product which labels the cell green. The dye is passed
on to dividing daughter cells but is not transferable to
neighbouring cells. Dividing cells would fail to retain
the same intensity of green dye as it is being diluted
to progeny cells. Cells were treated with 10 µg/mL of
monoclonal antibodies for 6 days and dye retention in cells
was analysed by flow cytometry. As expected, the levels
of fluorescence intensity in untreated cells, seeMet 11 and
seeMet 18 treated cells fell to levels similar to unstained
cells (Figure 7B & C). seeMet 2 and 13 treated cells
retained significant levels of green fluorescence indicating
an absence of cell division.

seeMet 2 and 13 showed the strongest binding to
native c-Met in flow cytometry. In order to determine if
these antibodies have any physiological effects on tumour
cells, 10 µg/mL of seeMet antibody was added to SNU5 cells. The effects of seeMet 2 and 13 on SNU-5 cell
viability and caspase activation were recorded after 72 hrs
of antibody treatment (Figure 6). seeMet 11 and 18, which
demonstrated weak affinity in flow cytometry, were used
as controls. SU11274 showed a significant reduction in
cell viability and high caspase activation. This indicates
that SU11274 acts by induction of caspase activity which
in turn result in apoptosis of SNU-5 tumour cells. Cells
treated with seeMet 2 or 13 appear to have reduced cell
viability in the CellTiter-Glo® assay, and reduced caspase
activation in the Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay. To determine
the effects of seeMet monoclonal antibody on cell
growth, a cell count was performed 72 hrs post antibody
treatment. Remarkably, almost no increase in cell number
was detected in cells exposed to seeMet 2 implying that
seeMet 2 inhibited cell division completely. seeMet 2
showed the strongest cell growth reduction followed by
seeMet 13. In this assay, seeMet 18 induced only a slight
inhibition of cell division and seeMet 11 had no effect

Internalisation of seeMet 2 and 13 in SNU-5 cells

detected by anti-mouse Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated
secondary antibody. Antibody localisation was observed
by confocal microscopy. At 4oC, staining of both seeMet
2 and 13 were observed to be localised on the cell
membrane with diffused cytoplasmic staining (Figure
8). Antibody localisation on the cell surface became less
prominent at 37oC while increase staining was observed
in the cytoplasm. Cytoplasmic staining was observed to
accumulate in the cell, suggesting that seeMet 2 and 13
were internalised upon binding to c-Met and accumulate
within the cell.

In order to determine if seeMet 2 and 13 were

Temperature sensitivity of seeMet 2
To determine if temperature affects the binding
affinity of seeMet monoclonal antibody to native c-Met,
seeMet 2, 13, 11 and 18 were incubated with live SNU-5
cells at 4oC or 37oC. Binding of monoclonal antibody to
native c-Met expressed on the cell surface of live SNU-5
cells was detected using anti-mouse secondary antibody
conjugated with Alexa Fluor®488 dye and analysed by
flow cytometry. Antibody binding, which correlates with
fluorescence intensity, was compared at the different
temperatures. Interestingly, each antibody demonstrated
a peak shift between different temperatures (Figure 9),
indicating a decrease in antibody binding at 4oC. Among
the four antibodies tested, seeMet 2 showed the most
drastic peak shift. It is plausible that the reduction of
antibody binding is due to the unavailability of antibody’s
epitope on native c-Met expressed on live SNU-5 cells.
We hypothesise that c-Met is a dynamic protein at normal
physiological temperature and becomes more rigid at low
temperature, causing certain epitopes to be obscured.

Alanine scan analysis of seeMet 2 main epitope

Weak binding

The previous pepscan analysis was designed
to narrow down an antibody’s epitope to be within a
maximum of 15 amino acid residues. However, not all
residues in the peptide may be involved in antibody-Met
interaction. To further understand the decrease in antibody
binding at low temperature, the epitope of seeMet 2 was
mapped to greater detail. Pepscan analysis of seeMet
2 demonstrated that seeMet 2 bound to peptides O28
(CIFSPQIEEPSQCPD) and O29 (QIEEPSQCPDCVVSA)
with equal affinity (Figure 10A). This indicates that
the epitope of seeMet 2 is shared by both peptides.
To identify critical residues in seeMet 2 interaction,
variations of peptides O28 and O29, where each amino
acid residue is sequentially substituted for an alanine
residue, were synthesised. Peptides P1 to P16 and P17
to P31 were derived from the original peptide O28 and
O29 respectively (Table 3). Utilising the same ELISAbased assay described previously, synthesised peptides
were added to streptavidin-coated wells. Purified seeMet

2 was then added to each alanine-substituted peptide and
antibody binding was determined by absorbance reading
at 450 nM. Loss of antibody interaction to a peptide would
demonstrate the importance of the substituted amino
acid residue in seeMet 2-Met interaction. Peptide O27,
peptide O1 and no peptide were used as negative controls.
Interestingly, although the first 10 amino acids of peptide
O28 overlaps with peptide O27, seeMet 2 does not bind to
peptide O27. This highlights the stringent requirement of
seeMet 2 binding.
In the presence of 1 mM DTT, alanine scan analysis
revealed that seeMet 2 failed to bind to peptides P1, P7,
P8, P9, P10, P14, P15, P17, P19, P20 and P25 when the
antibody was used at 0.05 µg/mL (data not shown). The
substituted amino acid residues in these peptides are
thus involved in seeMet 2 epitope. Interestingly, proline
residues that form kinks in protein structures were
observed to be important residues in the seeMet 2 epitope.
This is supported by the loss of seeMet 2 binding due to
the substitution of proline by alanine residues in peptides
P14, P25 and P10. Using a higher range of seeMet 2
concentration, a detailed titration of seeMet 2 binding
to the alanine scan peptides was performed to further

define the relative contribution of different amino acids
to the interaction (Figure 10B). These extensive titrations
gave very clear indications on the relative impact of the
different alanine substitutions. The peptides are listed
in Table 2 in the order of increasing binding affinity to
seeMet 2.
seeMet 2 bound peptides P1, P8 and P14 the least,
indicating that the substituted residues, ‘C’, ‘E’ and ‘P’
respectively, are most critical for seeMet 2 binding
(Figure 10B and Table 2). Further analysis of seeMet
2 titration results showed that the residues ‘IEE’ and
‘CPDC’ form the main epitope. These residues are not
consecutive residues. The importance of proline residues
and the non-consecutive residues in seeMet 2 main epitope
strongly suggests that the native structure of c-Met is
important for seeMet 2 binding. This is consistent with
the observed character of seeMet 2 i.e. seeMet 2 has high
affinity and specificity towards native c-Met and not to
denatured c-Met. It is only when a protein is in its tertiary
conformation that non-consecutive resides lie side by
side and come together to form a site for protein-protein
interaction.

structure of c-Met (PBD 1SHY), revealed that the main
epitope fell into two distinct clusters: residues 166 to 168
‘IEE’ and 172 to 175 ‘CPDC’ (Figure 10C). The ‘IEE’
motif, in yellow, is exposed on the surface of c-Met while
the ‘CPDC’ motif, in red, is buried within c-Met. How
seeMet 2 is able to bind to the cryptic ‘CPDC’ motif is not
known but it is probable that this region could be more
exposed by molecular dynamic fluctuations that can occur
on the surface of cancer cells [12]. Computer simulation
studies of seeMet 2 binding will further elucidate this
cryptic epitope of seeMet 2.

the small molecule inhibitors are of major concern. In
addition, SU11274 was reported to be ineffective against
specific c-Met mutations [20, 21]. Abounader et al. [22]
reported the use of U1snRNA/ribozyme to downregulate
the expression levels of c-Met/HGF. Although this method
is novel and intriguing, at present it is not feasible to use
this method for cancer treatment due to delivery issues.
The U1snRNA/ribozyme has to be efficiently delivered
into every tumour cell in order to be effective. The process
of delivery will be a challenging problem. The use of
HGF and c-Met fragments, such as NK4 and decoyMet respectively, to compete for Met-HGF interactions
has been examined. These competitive inhibitors show
efficient inhibition of c-Met signaling in xenograft models
[23-25]. NK4 is presently in clinical trials [26].
The success of using therapeutic monoclonal
antibodies for cancer treatment is evident. Herceptin
(Trastuzamab), a humanised IgG1 antibody targeted
against the human epidermal growth factor receptor
(HER2), is widely used for the treatment of breast
cancer. Rituxan (Rituximab) targeting CD20 and Avastin
(Bevaciumab) targeting vascular endothelial growth
factor receptor (VEGFR), both chimeric IgG1 antibodies,
have been successful in treatment of lymphomas and of
colorectal and lung cancer respectively [27]. Therapeutic
antibodies success in disease treatment can be attributed
to their high affinity and specificity towards their target
antigen. Antibody stability in vivo and their ability to
recruit the host immune system to destroy tumour cells
make this form of therapy clinically advantageous over
other types of c-Met/HGF inhibitors [28]. In addition,

DISCUSSION
c-Met is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in a wide
range of biological activities such as cell proliferation,
cell motility, angiogenesis and morphogenesis. Aberrant
expression of c-Met correlates with tumour aggression and
cancer progression. Expression of c-Met is also known to
cause drug resistance towards HER2, EGFR and B-RAF
treatment [13-16]. c-Met is thus an attractive target for
cancer therapy.
Many groups have used various mechanisms to
inhibit c-Met activation. Small molecule kinase inhibitors
such as the PHA-665752, AM7 and SU11274 were
extremely successful in inhibiting c-Met activation [1719]. However, toxicity issues due to off-target effects of

An alanine scan was used to further identify amino acid
residues involved in seeMet 2 epitope. Initial studies indicate
that seeMet 2 bound to peptides O28 and O29. An alanine
residue, marked in red, was sequentially substituted for each
amino acid residue in peptides O28 and O29. These peptides
were synthesised. Peptide sequences are listed. Peptides P1 to
P16 and peptides P17 to P31 are derivatives of peptides O28
and O29 respectively. All cystine residues were substituted for
alanine residues in peptides P16 and P31 to determine the effect
of disulphide bonds in seeMet 2 epitope.

internalisation [11]. Presently, MetMab is in clinical trials
[30]. Given the success of antibodies in cancer therapy and
c-Met involvement in cancer development, the outlook
for developing therapeutic antibodies against c-Met is
promising.
In this study, we have developed a panel of
murine monoclonal antibodies against the α-chain of
human c-Met. Here, we term the antibodies: Specifically
Engaging Extracellular c-Met (seeMet). We characterised
the antibodies by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation,
flow cytometry, epitope mapping and agonist/
antagonist activity towards c-Met. The α-chain was
used as immunogen as it was best expressed and most
immunogenic among other c-Met fragments (full length
β-chain, extracellular β-chain, extracellular domain of
c-Met). Comparison with the commercial antibodies (SC10 and AF276) has revealed the superior performance
of our new antibodies in immunoblotting. seeMet 11
and 12 were the best antibodies for Western blotting as
they demonstrated good affinity and specificity towards
c-Met. In addition, our antibodies are able to function in
Phallodin

immunoprecipitation and ELISA. Antibodies that have
higher affinity and specificity compared to the currently
available commercial antibodies, and characterised in
various biochemical techniques, will be valuable tools for
c-Met further studies. Finally Pozner-Moulis et al. [31]
questioned the reliability of commercial c-Met antibodies
as cancer prognosis markers. Of the five commercial
c-Met antibodies examined to quantify c-Met protein
levels, some antibodies had batch variation while others
had non-reproducible results. This emphasises the need to
develop and characterise reliable c-Met antibodies.
Despite the use of prokaryotic-expressed denatured
protein as immunogen, it was still possible to obtain
antibodies that recognise native c-Met protein. Antibodies
such as seeMet 13, showed poor affinity and poor
specificity to c-Met by Western blotting, but, along with
seeMet 2, produced the highest fluorescence staining
determined by flow cytometry. Clearly, seeMet 2 and 13
epitopes lies in c-Met native conformation. In SNU-5
cells, seeMet 2 and 13 do not cause caspase activation and
do not cause cell death as suggested by lack of annexin

V staining (data not shown). Western blot analysis of
antibody-treated cells using the senescence marker and
autophagy marker, p16 and LC-3 respectively, were
negative for such events (data not shown). Through the
binding of seeMet 2 or 13 to c-Met, the only functional
effect these antibodies elicit is the reduction of SNU-5 cell
division. Finally, our antibodies are non-agonistic towards
c-Met in cell scatter assays.
Given the advances in antibody engineering,
there are several ways antibodies may be engineered for
cancer therapy and diagnosis. seeMet 2 and 13 bind to
endogenous c-Met on live SNU-5 cells with high affinity
and specificity. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrates
that seeMet 2 and 13 are internalised into tumour cell,
most likely mediated via endocytosis. Combining the
technology in molecular imaging and nanotechology,
c-Met antibodies may be engineered into powerful tools
for in vivo tumour imaging. This will provide valuable

information on tumour physiology which will help
improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis and therapy. c-Met
antibodies may also be engineered to carry toxic payloads
into tumour cells and cause tumour cell killing. The
very encouraging clinical results reported with Kadcyla,
a Herceptin mertansine-conjugate, just obtaining FDA
approval for the treatment of advanced breast cancer
strongly support this idea.
So far, we have shown treatment of SNU-5 cells
with 10 µg/mL of seeMet monoclonal antibody. Other
groups have shown, and it is also plausible, to use
higher concentrations of antibody treatment. Testing our
antibodies at higher concentration might provide better
insights into our antibodies’ mode of action. Interestingly,
the bivalent LMH 87 antibody described by Greenall et
al. [11] shares a similar binding epitope to seeMet 13.
Like seeMet 13, LMH 87 antibody is a non-agonist, is
internalised into the cell and caused cell growth inhibition.

of c-Met activation by HGF are still unclear. This
interaction is more complex than previously thought and

critical interaction sites that are responsible for eliciting
various c-Met activities. In addition, the discovery of
the seeMet 2 cryptic epitope suggests that c-Met is a
dynamic protein and this further illustrates the lack of
understanding we have on c-Met physiology. seeMet 2
may be similar to the EGFR 806 antibody, that recognises
a cryptic epitope that is only expressed on tumour cells
[12]. Interestingly, the 806 antibody epitope contains two
cysteine residues, which are similar to the ‘CPDC’ motif
in seeMet 2 epitope, forming a covalent sulfhydryl bond.
Biochemical studies, computer simulation studies and
antibody crystallisation studies will help to unravel this
mystery and our antibodies would be the perfect tools for
further c-Met studies.

Cloning, prokaryotic expression and purification
of c-Met α-chain
c-Met α-chain was first cloned from the
entry vector, containing full length human c-Met
cDNA (Invitrogen #IOH36570), into pCR2.1
vector (Invitrogen) using the TOPO TA cloning kit
(Invitrogen). Amplification of c-Met α-chain was
performed using c-Met α-chain primers (alphaF:
5’-ATATGGAGTGTAAAGAGGCACTAGC-3’
and
alphaR: 5’- CTATCTCTTTTTTCTCTTTTCTGTGAG-3’).
All plasmid extraction, gel extraction and PCR product
purification protocols were performed using Qiagen
(United Kingdom) kits, according to manufacturer’s
protocol.
For prokaryotic expression, c-Met α-chain was
subcloned from pCR2.1 vector into His-tag pET19b
expression vector (Novagen/Merck) and transformed
into BL21 pLysS cells (Invitrogen). Transformed cells
were grown until an OD600 0.4 to 0.6 was reached. Protein
expression was induced by adding IPTG (isopropyl-βD-thio-galactoside) to a final concentration of 1 mM.
Cultures were allowed to grow for 3 hrs. Cells were
recovered by centrifugation and resuspended in lysis
buffer (0.3 M KCL, 50 mM KH2PO4, pH 8.0). Cell lysate
was centrifuged at 33,000 xg. The cell pellet obtained
was resuspended in lysis buffer containing 6 M urea and
incubated overnight with gentle stirring. The resulting
suspension was centrifuged and the supernatant obtained
was used for protein purification.
Prokaryotically expressed c-Met α-chain was
affinity purified on a 1 mL IMAC (immunobilised metal
affinity chromatography) Bio-Scale Mini Cartridge
(Bio-Rad, U.S.A), using the automated Profinia protein
purification system (Bio-Rad). c-Met α-chain was eluted
and used to immunise mice for antibody production.

dye (Invitrogen #C2102) was resuspended in DMSO,
according to manufacturer’s protocol.

Mouse immunisation and hybridoma fusion
Antibody production was performed by Moravian
Biotechnology (Czech Republic). Briefly, mice were
immunised with purified human c-Met α-chain expressed
from bacteria. Each injection contained 40 μg of purified
c-Met α-chain. Mouse tail bleeds were taken to test for
immunological response against c-Met α-chain. Two mice
that gave the highest immune response against c-Met
α-chain were sacrificed for hybridoma cell fusion. Spleen
cells from mice were fused with SP2./0-Ag14 cells which
are mouse immortal myeloma cells. Hybridoma cells
were grown in selection media containing hypoxanthine,
aminopterin and thymidine. Only hybridoma cells which
have been successfully fused between a spleen cell and an
immortal cell will survive and grow in the selection media.

Cell harvest and cell lysis
Cell culture plates/dishes were rinsed with cold PBS
before the cells were scraped off. Cells were collected by
centrifugation. PBS was removed before quick freezing
the cell pellet on dry ice. The frozen cell pellet was lysed
on ice using NP40 lysis buffer (1% NP40, 150 mM NaCl,
50 mM Tris-HCL pH 8.0) containing complete protease
inhibitor (Roche, United Kingdom, #11 697 498 001). Cell
lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 xg and the supernatant
was recovered for analysis. Protein quantification was
performed using a BCA kit (Pierce/Thermo Scientific),

Antibody screening

Western blotting and antibodies

Antibody screening was performed mainly by cell
staining and Western blotting. An outline of monoclonal
antibody screening is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
Hybridoma cells were screened for anti-α-chain antibody
production ten days after cell fusion.

The commercially-obtained SC-10 antibody
(Santa Cruz, U.S.A) was raised against a peptide within
the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of human c-Met and
would be expected to recognise c-Met precursor (170 kD)
and mature c-Met β-chain (145 kD) on Western blots.
AF276 antibody (R&D systems) is a goat antibody raised
against the extracellular domain of c-Met. AF276 antibody
would be expected to recognise c-Met precursor, mature
c-Met β-chain and mature c-Met α-chain on Western
blots. Both SC-10 and AF276 antibodies were used at 1:
10 000 dilution on Western blotting. 1 µg/mL of seeMet
monoclonal antibody was used for Western blotting.
HRP conjugation to seeMet antibodies was
performed using EZ-link Plus Activated Peroxidase
(Pierce/Thermo Scientific). HRP conjugated antibodies
were used at 1 µg/mL on Western blotting.
Protein samples were mixed with 4X LDS sample
buffer (Invitrogen) and 10X sample reducing agent
(Invitrogen) before analysing on 4 -12% Bis-Tris gradient
gels (Invitrogen) using MOPs buffer (Invitrogen). SeeBlue
Plus2 protein ladder (Invitrogen) was used as molecular
weight ladder. Transfer of proteins onto a nitrocellulose
membrane (0.45 μm pore size, Whatman, United
Kingdom) was performed using Bio-Rad wet transfer
system for 2 hrs, at a constant current of 100 V. Transfer
buffer contains 25 mM Tris, 192 mM glycine and 20%
methanol. Blocking buffer was made up of 5% Marvel
milk in PBST (1% Tween 20 in PBS). Non-specific sites
on the membrane were blocked in blocking buffer before
incubating with primary antibodies. The membrane was
washed three times and secondary antibodies were added at
1:10 000 dilution in blocking buffer. Secondary antibodies
conjugated to horseradish peroxidise (HRP) were obtained
from Jacksons Laboratory/Stratech Scientific Ltd.
(United Kingdom). Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL)
(Amersham/G.E. Healthcare, United Kingdom) was used
for the detection of Western blots.

Isotyping
Mouse monoclonal antibodies isotype were
characterised
using
the
commercially-available
IsoQuick™ strips (Sigma-Aldrich). Isotyping strips were
incubated in hybridoma cell supernatant for 5 mins.

Pepscan and alanine scan
Peptides for Pepscan: Peptides that span the entire
α-chain of c-Met were synthesised. A total of fifty-five
peptides with consecutive, overlapping sequences were
synthesised. Each peptide consists of 15 amino acid
residues and overlapped the previous peptide by 10 amino
acid residues.
Peptides for alanine scan: Pepscan results
showed that seeMet 2 bound to peptides O28
(CIFSPQIEEPSQCPD) and O29 (QIEEPSQCPDCVVSA).
Variations of peptides O28 and O29, where each amino
acid residue was sequentially substituted for an alanine
residue, were synthesised.
All peptides were linked to biotin by an SGSG
linker sequence at the N-terminus and were synthesised by
Mimotopes (Australia). Streptavidin-coated plates (Pierce/
Thermo Scientific, #15520) were blocked with 3% BSA/
PBS at room temperature. The peptides were dissolved
in DMSO and stored according to manufacturer’s
recommendation. Streptavidin-coated plates were
coated with each peptide (5 μg/mL) overnight at room
temperature. Wells were washed before hybridoma
supernatant or purified monoclonal antibody was added
to the each well. HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody
was added to detect bound monoclonal antibodies. ELISA
substrate (Bio-Rad #172-1067) solution was prepared
freshly according to the manufacturer’s instructions and
added to the wells. Colour change was monitored by eye
and the reaction was stopped by adding 100 mM sulphuric
acid. Absorbance was read at 450 nM in a microplate
reader (SPECTRAmax PLUS384, Molecular Device,
U.S.A). The crystal structure of c-Met extracellular
domain, accession number 1SHY, was obtained from
Protein Data Base (PDB). Computer imaging of the
epitopes were analysed by PyMol (DeLano Scientific
LLC, U.S.A) software.

Immunoprecipitation
Cells lysates were obtained by lysing cells in NP40
lysis buffer as described above. 1 µg of purified antibody
was incubated overnight with cell lysate (200 μg – 500
μg of total protein in approximately 500 μL). Washed
protein G beads (Sigma-Aldrich, U.S.A) were added to
the cell lysate. Beads were collected by centrifugation
at 18,000 xg and washed several times with NP40 lysis
buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by adding 2X LDS
sample buffer and heated at 100oC. Beads were removed
from eluate by centrifugating at 10,000 xg. The eluate was
analysed by SDS-PAGE gel.

Flow cytometry

during the assay.

Cell division using cell counter and CellTracker
Green BODIPY dye

Flow cytometry was performed with help from Flow
Cytometry Core Facility (College of Medicine, Dentistry
and Nursing, University of Dundee, United Kingdom).
SNU-5 cells (1 x 106 cells) were washed once in
cold PBS before blocking in 1% BSA/PBS. Cells were
washed twice before incubating with seeMet monoclonal
antibodies. 1 μg/mL of seeMet monoclonal antibodies
were used. Cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse
IgG FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies (Invitrogen)
and finally resuspended in 1% BSA/PBS. Flow cytometry
was performed using Becton Dickinson (U.S.A) FACScan.
Cell Quest (Becton Dickinson) and FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.,
U.S.A) software was used for data analysis.
Temperature sensitivity: 10 µg/mL of seeMet
monoclonal antibody were incubated with live SNU-5
cells for 1 hr at 4oC or 37oC. Cells were harvested and
washed once in cold PBS. Antibody binding to live cells
was determined by Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated antimouse secondary antibodies (Invitrogen #A11029). Cells
were resuspended in 1% BSA/PBS and analysed by flow
cytometry.

Cell division: Cells were seeded and treated with
seeMet monoclonal antibodies for 72 hrs. Cells were
harvested and counted using the automated ADAM cell
counter (Digital Bio, Korea).
CellTracker Green BODIPY dye: SNU-5 cells were
stained with 5 µM of CellTracker BODIPY dye for 30
mins. Stained cells were seeded and treated with seeMet
monoclonal antibodies for 6 days. Cells were harvested
and dye retention in live cells were analysed by flow
cytometry.

Immunofluorescence

100 - 200 HaCaT cells were seeded in 24-well plates
and allowed to grow until small colonies were formed
(approximately 7 days). Cells were serum-starved for
24 hrs. Cells were incubated with purified monoclonal
antibodies (1 μg/mL) for 24 hrs before rinsing twice in
cold PBS and fixing in ice-cold methanol. Cells were then
stained in 1% crystal-violet (Sigma-Aldrich) solution. Cell
staining was observed using Zeiss Axiovert 25 inverted
microscope and pictures were taken using a Canon EOS
1000 D camera.

10 µg/mL of seeMet monoclonal antibody were
incubated with live SNU-5 cells for 1 hr at 4oC or 37oC.
Antibody-treated cells were washed once with PBS
and deposited onto polylysine-coated slides (Thermo
Scientific, #5991056) using the Thermo Shandon Cytospin
3 Cytofuge (Thermo Scientific) at 800 rpm for 5 mins and
fixed immediately in 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were
then blocked and permeablised in PBS containing 0.4%
Triton X-100 and 5% BSA. Bound seeMet antibodies were
detected using anti-mouse Alexa Fluor®488-conjugated
secondary antibody. Phallodin was added together with
the secondary antibodies. Cells were washed before
staining with 4’,6’-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and
mounted with Hydromount (National Diagnostics, U.S.A)
containing 2.5% DABCO (1,4- Diazabicyclo-[2.2.2]
octane) (Sigma-Aldrich) as an anti-bleaching agent.
Immunofluorescence was observed using Nikon Eclipse
E600 microscope.

Cell viability and caspase activation

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay
and Caspase-Glo® 3/7 assay (Promega, U.S.A) were
used to determine cell viability and caspase activation
respectively. SNU-5 cells (1 x 105 cells) were seeded in
each 96-well and treated for 72 hrs before analysis. Cell
viability and caspase activation were performed according
to manufacturer’s protocol. Luminescence was read using
the EnVision plate reader (PerkinElmer, U.S.A). While
the CellTiter-Glo® luminescent cell viability assay is
generally used as a cell viability assay, it actually measures
cellular ATP levels. If a cell population fails to divide
over the course of an assay (as seen in the study reported
here) it can appear to have reduced “viability” (lower ATP
levels) without, in fact, any loss of cell viability when
compared to cell populations that increase in number
