Abstract
AXL is a tyrosine kinase receptor activated by GAS6 and regulates cancer cell
proliferation migration and angiogenesis. We studied AXL as new therapeutic target
in colorectal cancer (CRC). Expression and activation of AXL and GAS6 were evaluated
in a panel of human CRC cell lines. AXL gene silencing or pharmacologic inhibition
with foretinib suppressed proliferation, migration and survival in CRC cells. In an
orthotopic colon model of human HCT116 CRC cells overexpressing AXL, foretinib
treatment caused significant inhibition of tumour growth and peritoneal metastatic
spreading. AXL and GAS6 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) were found
in 76,7% and 73.5%, respectively, of 223 human CRC specimens, correlating with less
differentiated histological grading. GAS6 overexpression was associated with nodes
involvement and tumour stage. AXL gene was found amplified by Fluorescence in situ
hybridization (FISH) in 8/146 cases (5,4%) of CRC samples.
Taken together, AXL inhibition could represent a novel therapeutic approach in
CRC.

Introduction

cetuximab, panitumumab, bevacizumab and regorafenib
contributed to extend the survival of these patients [3-5].
However, resistance to both chemotherapy and molecular
targeted agents might occur [6]. Identification of resistance
mechanisms and activation of alternative pathways are
crucial for improving therapeutic efficacy.
AXL is a member of the TAM (TYRO3, AXL,
MER) receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family [7,8]. The
primary ligand for TAM receptors is Growth ArrestSpecific 6 (GAS6), a fairly large (75 kDa), vitamin

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a prominent global
health problem, representing the third most common
cancer worldwide [1]. Metastatic CRC (mCRC) occurs
in about 25% of patients at diagnosis [2] and it is a not
curable disease in approximately 25-30% of patients,
following treatment of locoregional disease; several
chemotherapeutics agents including irinotecan, oxaliplatin
and more recently targeted monoclonal agents, such as

Microarray gene expression analysis was performed in CRC cell lines expressing AXL and CRC cell lines defined
as AXL negative. Using the Student’s t test with Benjamini–Hochberg multiple test correction, 1553 and 1061 genes
were identified as up-regulated or down-regulated, respectively, in AXL positive CRC cells (t test, P < 0,05). Among
the up-regulated genes we identify 33 genes involved in epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) listed in the
table.

Results

K–dependent protein, known to activate downstream
signalling [9]. Binding of GAS6 to the extracellular
domain of AXL leads to dimerization of GAS6–AXL
complexes. The latter results in autophosphorylation of
tyrosine residues (Tyr779, Tyr821 and Tyr866) in the
intracellular tyrosine kinase domain [9].
AXL is overexpressed in several human cancers,
including various leukemias and solid tumours, where
it is associated with a poor prognosis [10-17]. For these
reasons, we examined the potential biological relevance
of AXL pathway activation and its inhibition in CRC
preclinical models and AXL and GAS6 expression in
human CRC specimens.

Expression and activation of AXL in human
colorectal cancer cell lines
We first performed a screening with a receptor
tyrosine kinase array in four human CRC cell lines
(SW620, SW480, LOVO, HCT116) non-responsive to the
anti-EGFR targeting drugs, as they harbour mutations in
KRAS genes [18-22]. Among several receptors involved
in CRC tumorigenesis, AXL phospho-protein was
found in all four human CRC cell lines (Figure 1A). As
illustrated in Figure 1B, AXL protein expression was also
confirmed in SW620, SW480, LOVO, HCT116, whereas
no expression was found in the remaining cells: SW48,

Figure 1: Expression and activation of AXL in human CRC cell lines. A. 300 µg of protein lysates were obtained from human

CRC cell lines SW620, SW480, LOVO, HCT116 and were analysed by human phospho-kinase array evaluating the following receptors:
AXL, EphA1, EphA2, EphA3, EphA6, EphA4, EphA7, EphB1 EphB2, EphB4, EphB6, ErbB2, ErbB3, ErbB4, EGFR, FGF R1, FGFR2a,
FGF R3, FGFR4, Flt 3, HGF R, insulinR, IGF-I R, Mer, MSPR, MCSFR, MuSK, PDGFrα, PDGrβ, SCFR, cRET, ROR1, ROR2, Tie2,
TrkA, TrkB, TrkC, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, Tie1. B. Western blot analysis of AXL receptor in SW48, SW48-CR, HT29, LOVO,
SW620, HCT15, HCT116, GEO, GEO-CR, COLO205, SW480. Thirty micrograms of cell protein extracts were fractionated through 4%
to 20% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with the indicated antibodies as described in Materials and Methods.
Immunoreactive proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. C. specific mRNA expression by quantitative real time-PCR:
total RNA was extracted from colorectal (SW620, SW48, SW480, HT29, LOVO, HCT15, HCT116) and thyroid cancer cell lines (TPC,
CAL 62) quantitative real time-PCR was done to assess the expression of AXL and GAS6 mRNA. D. GAS6 protein levels were measured
in cell culture media of CRC cancer (SW620, SW48, SW480, HT29, LOVO, HCT15, HCT116) and thyroid (TPC, NIM) cancer cell lines
by using specific ELISA as described in Materials and Methods.

HT29, HCT15, GEO, COLO205, GEO-CR and SW48CR, these two latter cell lines present acquired resistance
to cetuximab [23]. AXL and its ligand GAS6 mRNA were
also screened by real time-PCR (RT-PCR) using TPC1
and CAL62, two thyroid cancer cell lines, as positive
controls. AXL mRNA was detected at variable levels
ranging between 1 and 238,8 fold as compared with TPC1
and CAL62 in the cell lines tested, being barely detected
in SW48, HT129 and HCT15. GAS6 mRNA was weakly
found in all CRC cell lines (range 1-14,9) (Figure 1C).
We analysed the secretion of GAS6 into the cell
culture media (CM). Forty-eight hours (hrs) after cell
seeding, cancer cells were serum starved and collected
after additional 24 hrs. As shown in Figure 1D, GAS6 was
secreted only by thyroid cancer cells (NIM) that were used
as a positive control (Figure 1D), suggesting a ligandindependent activation of AXL in human CRC cells.
In order to identify genes or pathways related with
AXL expression, we analysed baseline microarray gene

expression of CRC cell lines expressing AXL compared
to CRC cell lines defined as AXL negative. In this respect,
we found 1553 and 1061 genes defined as up-regulated
or down-regulated, respectively, in AXL positive cancer
cell lines (t test, p < 0.05) (data not shown). Among the
up-regulated genes, 33 genes are involved in epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) (Table 1).

AXL blockade inhibits colorectal cancer cell
proliferation and survival
Inhibition of AXL might be a novel therapeutic
approach to treat CRC. Therefore, we evaluated the effects
on cell growth proliferation of foretinib, which is an oral
multikinase inhibitor of c-MET and VEGFR2 and that
was recently described as a potent inhibitor of AXL [24].
We tested treatment with foretinib in HCT116, SW480,
SW620, LOVO, HCT15, HT29 and SW48. Cancer cells

experiments each done in triplicate. B. Analysis of intracellular signalling pathways by Western blot in SW620, LOVO, HCT116, SW48

cell growth. AXL silencing showed a statistical significant
suppression of cell growth in sh-Cl1 and 3 (p < 0.05)
(Figure 3C). We also performed the trypan blue exclusion
viability assay and we verified that sh-AXL clones did not
showed any trypan blue staining, suggesting a delay of cell
growth rather then cell death (data not shown).
To investigate the role of AXL in CRC cell
migration we used transwell cell culture chambers. ShAXL
clones (Cl1, 3 and 5) showed a clear decrease of invasive
ability with respect to shCTR cells after 24 hrs. These data
confirm that AXL is an important mediator of migration
and invasion in these CRC cells (Figure 3D).

were treated with foretinib at dose concentrations ranging
from 0.1 to 10 μM for 72 hr. The drug concentrations
required to inhibit cell growth by 50% (IC50) were
determined by interpolation from the dose-response
curves. As shown in Figure 2A IC50 values ranging
between 1 μM and > 5 μM. The most sensitive cells to
foretinib were HCT116 and SW620 (IC501μM) whereas
the most resistant were HT29 and SW48 cells with little
or no growth inhibition even up to 10μM concentration of
the drug.
To determine the inhibition of intracellular signals
for cell survival and proliferation, Western blot analysis
were performed on protein extracts derived from SW620,
LOVO, HCT116 and SW48 cancer cells, treated with
foretinib (2μM) for 2 and 24 hrs. Foretinib treatment
decreased the levels of active phosphorylated AXL
(pAXL) and its downstream pathway in SW620, LOVO
and HCT116 cells (Figure 2B).
To further evaluate AXL inhibition effects, we used a
RNA interference approach. LOVO, HCT116 and SW620
human CRC cells were transfected with AXL specifics
siRNAs. AXL silencing was verified by Western blot.
AXL knockdown correlated with a significant inhibition
of proliferation evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) in HCT116,
LOVO and SW480 of 78% and 68%, respectively (p <
0.001) (Figure 3C). Moreover, seventy-two hrs after AXL
silencing, a reduction of 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU)
incorporation of 70 % was observed (data not shown).
Inhibition of AXL gene expression was also accompanied
by a reduction of phosphoERK (pERK), phosphoAKT
(pAKT) and phospho ribosomal protein S6, 24, 48 and 72
hrs after AXL silencing, (Figure 2D).

Pharmacologic inhibition of AXL signalling
activation with foretinib in a human colorectal
cancer orthotopic xenograft model
We further investigated the in vivo antitumor activity
of foretinib. We developed a colon orthotropic model of
human HCT116 cells in nude mice. We did not use LOVO
AXL knockdown clones for in vivo experiments because
of their low rate of proliferation that could affect subcutaneous growth.
Briefly, a total of 2 X 106 HCT116 cells re-suspended
in 200 µl of matrigel and PBS (1:1) were implanted
subcutaneously into the right flank of nude female mice.
When the average tumours reached a mean volume of 500
mm3 animals were euthanized, the tumours were removed
and divided into 2-3 mm-sized pieces and harvested in
PBS. Mice were treated with antibiotics, ticarcillin (50
mg kg−1i.v.), two hrs before and after tumour implantation
(for more details refer to Materials and Methods). After
10 days from the orthotopic implantation of tumour in to
cecum wall of the mice, foretinib treatment was started
(15mg/kg) per os 5 days a week for three weeks. As
shown in Figure 4A and Table 2, the control group mice
had large tumours in cecum with a 100% incidence of
regional lymph nodes and peritoneal metastasis, showing,
furthermore, worst clinical conditions and weight loss.
In particular, in the control arm the mean weight was
statistically lower compared to the treatment arm (20,5
gr versus 23,5 gr; p < 0.0001) (Table 2). In the foretinib
treated arm, the necropsy of mice revealed no evidence
of peritoneal disease and metastasis in visceral organs
(intestine, rectum, liver, spleen and lung) (Figure 4A).
We performed a Western blot analysis for the expression
of AXL and the activated downstream pathways in the
tumours: pAXL, pAKT and pS6 ribosomal protein levels
were decreased in foretinib treated mice. No evident effect
on ERK phosphorylation was observed (Figure 4B).
Finally, in mice treated with foretinib, tumour
growth was significantly (p < 0 0.0001) decreased
compared with the control group, with a complete
response (defined as the absence of tumour at necropsy)
evidenced in one mouse (Figure 4C). Foretinib treatment

Biological effects of AXL gene stable inhibition in
LOVO human colorectal cells
We stably transfected LOVO CRC cells with a pool
of vectors expressing 5 different shRNAs directed against
AXL or expressing control non-targeting shRNAs. Stable
transfectants were selected and amplified in medium with
500ng/mL puromycin for 12 weeks. We identified clones
(Figure 3A) that expressed intermediate (shAXLCl 3) or
low (shAXLCl 1,5 and 8) AXL levels (Figure 3B). We
tried also to establish HCT116 stable transfectants but
HCT116 were not able to survive after AXL knockdown,
suggesting AXL relevant role in HCT116 cell survival
(data not shown). In shAXL1,3,5,8 clones, the activation
of the MAPK and PI3K pathways (pAKT and of pS6
ribosomal protein) were decreased with respect to control
(sh-AXL pool and sh-CTR) or parental cells (Figure 3B).
Furthermore, E-cadherin levels were slightly increased in
shAXL 1,3,5,8 clones, indirectly suggesting that AXL is a
marker of EMT (Figure 3B).
We verified whether AXL knockdown could inhibit

levels (staining in ≥20% cancer cells), whereas 35%
showed low expression (staining in < 20% cancer cells)
(Figure 5A). AXL staining mostly displayed membrane
positivity; in a small number of cases cytosolic staining
was observed and in one specimen nuclear staining was
detected. Tumoral stroma and non-tumoral adjacent tissues
were AXL negative, 10% of cases had endothelial cells
positivity. Colon normal tissue did not express AXL (data
not shown).
We further examined AXL intensity expression
pattern. Ninety-five percent of positive specimens
showed an incomplete baso-lateral membranous pattern.
The remaining cases were characterized by a complete
intensity pattern; 76 cases were scored as low (1+) (Figure
5B,b), 90 cases as moderate (2+) (Figure 5B,c), 5 cases
as high (3+) (Figure 5B,d). A significant correlation (p
< 0.0001) between cancer cell percentage staining and
intensity expression levels was found.

Expression of AXL and GAS6 proteins in human
colorectal cancer and AXL gene amplification
We evaluated whether AXL and its ligand GAS6
were expressed in CRC specimens. A total of 223
patients diagnosed with CRC were included. Baseline
clinicopathological characteristics of patients are
summarized in Table 3. The median follow up time was
39.5 months.
AXL protein expression by immunohistochemistry
(IHC) was detected in 171 out of 223 tumour specimens
(76.7%) whereas AXL expression was undetectable in
52 out of 223 (23.3%) (Figure 5A, Figure 5B,a). Among
AXL positive cases, 111 (65%) showed high expression

Since AXL was overexpressed in approximately 2/3
of AXL positive cases, we evaluated if gene amplification
could occur. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)
analysis was performed in 146 AXL positive specimens.
Eight cases (5.4%) showed AXL gene amplification
(Figure 5C,b) with AXL/CEP19 ratio ranging from 2
to 2.5, whereas 138 cases (94.6%) were FISH negative
(Figure 5C,a). A high significant correlation between
AXL protein expression levels and gene amplification was
observed (p < 0.0001). Within the 8 AXL gene amplified
specimens, high intense (3+) AXL protein expression
was found in 2 cases, AXL moderate intensity expression
pattern (2+) was detected in the other 6 cases. No cases
with AXL low intense (1+) were found FISH positive
(Figure 5D).
Furthermore, we analysed GAS6 expression levels
in the same specimens. We found 164 out 223 cases
(73.5%) that stained positively (Figure 5A), whereas 59
cases (26.5%) were negative for GAS6 expression (Figure
5A,B,e). Within the positive specimens, 52 (32%) were
classified as low expression (staining in < 20% cancer
cell), 112 as high expression (staining in ≥20% cancer

GAS6 showed a iuxtamembranous staining, 10%
of cases displayed stromal positivity, indicating that the
ligand can be provided by tumour microenvironment.
A significant statistical correlation between AXL and
GAS6 expression was found (p < 0.0001) (Figure 6A).
To investigate the clinical relevance of AXL and GAS6
status, we evaluated the association between patients
clinicopathological features and their expression levels.
Neither AXL nor GAS6 were associated with age, sex,

tumour primary location, tumour depth and presence of

spreading compared with untreated controls confirming
the in vitro findings.
The preclinical findings described in our manuscript
demonstrated that the antitumor activity obtained by
AXL inhibition is clinical relevant, because all human
CRC cell lines used do not respond to the common antiEGFR moAb due to KRAS mutations that confer primary
resistance to these agents. In this respect, several studies
suggest that overexpression of AXL may be implicated
in resistance to both targeted therapies and conventional
chemotherapy in different cancer models [7, 27]. In
a recent study it has been reported that in cellular lung
cancer models of acquired resistance to the EGFR TKI
erlotinib there was an increased activation of AXL and
induction of an EMT-like state [28-29]. Furthermore,
Brand and colleagues demonstrated that AXL is involved
in acquired resistance to cetuximab in models of head and
neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), in which it was
overexpressed, activated and tightly associated with EGFR
expression in cancer cells resistant to cetuximab [30].
However, in the present study we did not find AXL
pathway activation in two models of acquired resistance
to anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab (GEO-CR and SW48CR) that were generated in our laboratory. As a possible
explanation, in these two CRC cell lines (GEO-CR and
SW48-CR) acquired resistance to cetuximab was meanly
due to TGFα mediated heterodimerization of MET with
EGFR [23] and by activation of angiogenesis [31].
EMT is a process in which epithelial cells exert the
ability to migrate and invade surrounding tissues [32]. In
this respect, in cancer cells with AXL overexpression, 33
genes involved in EMT were found up-regulated with a
median fold-change of 22.7. Our findings support recent
studies showing that AXL expression was associated with
EMT [33-36] and in some case this phenomenon was
driven by autocrine interactions with GAS6 produced by
surrounding endothelial cells [10]. AXL can be activated
through a number of different mechanisms: liganddependent dimerization (principally driven by GAS6),
ligand-independent dimerization, interaction between
two monomers on neighbouring cells and heteromeric
dimerization with other receptors [37-38]. We did not
find GAS6 secretion into cell culture media suggesting
a ligand-independent activation of AXL in our in vitro
model.
We finally determined the prevalence and
clinicopathological significance of AXL and GAS6
expression in 223 human CRC tissues. In particular,
we showed that AXL and GAS6 overexpression is a
molecular trait of approximately 70% of CRC with a
different degree of expression, evaluated by IHC, with
a statistical significant correlation between the ligand
and receptor. Although AXL overexpression has been
previously reported in several solid tumours [10-17] this
significant correlation has never been reported, suggesting
the presence of an autocrine pathway between AXL and its

GAS6 expression, survival analysis was performed by
using Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) statistical test. In the AXL
negative patients population median Overall Survival (OS)
was 55.2 months (95% CI 41.5-68.9); in AXL-positive
low expression patients, OS was 51.8 months (30.6-73.1)
whereas in AXL-positive high expression patients, OS
was 59.2 months (95% CI 43.8-74.5). AXL expression
was not prognostic in our CRC dataset (p > 0.05; Figure
6C). In GAS6 negative patient population the median
OS was 55.8 months (95% CI 46.9 - 64.7); among the
GAS6-positive subgroups classified as low expression,
OS was 74.6 months (95% CI 55.8 - 93.5), in GAS6positive high expression, OS was 59.6 months (95% CI
48.0 - 71.2). GAS6 had no apparent impact on survival
(Figure 6C). Similar data were obtained with HSCORE
(refer to Materials and Methods for details) values (p >
0.05) and AXL intensity expression levels (p > 0.05) (data
not shown).

Discussion
Colorectal cancer is a complex heterogeneous
disease with defined subtypes based on different gene
expression profıles. Efforts have been made to find a
“consensus” subtypes classification useful to tailor therapy
for CRC patients. According to gene expression profiles
and genomic characterization, recently, at least three CRC
subgroups have been proposed: microsatellite instability
(MSI), chromosomal instability (CIN) epithelial/
proliferative and CIN mesenchymal/invasive phenotype
[25].
Critical genes and pathways important in the
initiation and progression include the WNT, RAS, MAPK,
PI3K, TGFβ, p53 and DNA mismatch-repair pathways
that, when genetically altered, negatively impact on drug
antitumor activity. Examples include the lack of benefıt of
anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) in presence
of RAS mutation [22]. Moreover, recently it has been
described that MET or HER2 gene amplification could be
involved in primary and acquired resistance mechanisms
to anti-EGFR moAbs [21,23].
In this scenario, AXL receptor might be considered
a novel potential target as its overexpression has been
reported in a variety of human cancers and it has been
associated with worse prognosis [10-17, 26].
To investigate the role of AXL in cancer
progression we used a panel of human CRC cell lines
were we detected AXL protein expression and activation.
Inhibiting AXL pathway by using specific silencing
RNA or a pharmacologic approach with foretinib, we
demonstrated that cancer cell proliferation and migration
was significantly suppressed. We further developed, in our
laboratory, a model of human colon orthotopic xenograft
nude mice, to evaluate the pharmacological inhibition of
AXL activation. Foretinib treatment caused significant
inhibition of tumour growth and peritoneal metastatic

AXL and GAS6 were markedly present in less
differentiated tumour specimens and only GAS6 was
associated with lymph nodes status and consequently
with tumour stage, showing a higher expression in more
advanced disease. Neither AXL nor GAS6 had any
apparent impact on survival, at least in our dataset. AXL
overexpression in CRC was reported in metastatic lesion
[39], moreover Dunne ad colleagues found that AXL was
a strong independent negative prognostic factors in early
stage of CRC [40].
Notably, this is the first study reporting AXL
gene amplification in 5,4% of CRC specimens that
overexpressed AXL protein; a significant correlation
between AXL protein intensity and gene amplification
was found.
Different preclinical evidences define AXL a
potential target to inhibit [7]. A recent report found AXL
mutations in CRC cell lines never described before and
many multi-kinase inhibitors blocking also AXL are under
investigations with no specific indication for CRC [13].
Collectively, the results herein reported highlight
AXL tyrosine kinase as a therapeutic target that is worth
to be explored in a clinical setting for CRC.

Cancer Institute, Naples, Italy). GEO-CR and SW-48 CR
cells were established as previously described (19). GEO
and GEO-CR cell lines were grown in DMEM (Lonza),
supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Lonza)
and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Lonza). SW48, SW48CR, LOVO, HCT15, HCT116 and SW480 cells were
grown in RPMI- 1640 (Lonza) supplemented with 10%
FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. SW620 and HT29
cancer cells were grown in McCoy medium (Lonza)
supplemented with 20% FBS (Lonza) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin (Lonza). All cell lines were grown in a
humidified incubator with 5% of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
95% air at 37 °C. All cell lines were routinely screened for
the presence of mycoplasma (Mycoplasma Detection Kit;
Roche Diagnostics).

Proliferation assay
Cell proliferation was analysed by the
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3 carboxymethxyphenyl)2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Cell
suspensions (2000 μl) containing 10000-15000 viable cells
were plated in a 24 multiwell plate. After 24 hrs cells were
treated with different concentrations of foretinib (0,01,
0,1, 0,5, 1, 2, 5 and 10 μM) for 72 hrs. Each experiment
was done in triplicate. Results represent the median of the
three experiments, each performed in triplicate.

Protein expression analysis

Foretinib was purchased from Selleck Chemicals
(Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA). It was dissolved
in sterile Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mM stock
solution concentration and stored in aliquots at -20 °C.
Working solutions were diluted in culture medium before
each experiment and the 10 mM stock solution was stored
at -20°C. For in vivo applications, foretinib was solubilized
in 0.5% Tween-80 in sterile Phosphate Buffered Saline
(PBS).

Protein lysates containing equal amount of proteins,
measured by a modified Bradford assay (BIORAD), were
subjected to immunoprecipitation or direct Western blot.
Immunocomplexes were dectected with the
enhanced chemiluminescence kit (ECL plus, Thermo
Fisher Scientific (Rockford, IL). We used the following
antibodies from Cell Signalling (Beverly, MA): antiERK, anti-phospho-pERK(T202/Y204), anti-AKT, antiphospho-AKT (S473), anti-AXL, anti-phospho-AXL
(Y702), anti-phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (S236/S253).
Anti-α-tubulin was from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO). The following secondary antibodies from
Bio-rad (Hercules, CA) were used: goat anti-rabbit IgG
and rabbit anti-mouse IgG. Each experiment was done in
triplicate. The Proteome Profiler Array has been performed
by following manufacturer’s protocol. (Human PhosphoKinase Array Kit, R&D Systems). Briefly, SW620,
SW480, LOVO and HCT116 cells were serum starved for
24 hrs and 300 µg of protein lysates were obtained and
incubated over night with the human phospho-kinase array
in order to analyse the phosphorylation profile of the 41
kinases.

Generation of stable AXL shRNA

Agilent microarray analyses were performed to
assess baseline gene expression profile for each cancer
cell line using a one color labeling microarray system
as described before [23]. Data were extracted from slide
image using Agilent Feature Extraction software (v.10.5).
The raw data and associated sample information were
loaded and processed by Gene Spring® 11.5X (Agilent
Technologies, CA, USA). For identification of genes
significantly altered in resistant cells, total detected entities
were filtered by signal intensity value (upper cut-off 100th
and lower cut-off 20th percentile) and flag to remove very
low signal entities. Data were analyzed using Student’s t
test (p < 0.05) with a Benjamani-Hochberg multiple test
correction to minimize selection of false positives. Of the
significantly differentially expressed RNA, only those
with greater than 2-fold increase or 2-fold decrease as
compared to the controls were used for further analysis.
Subsequently, hierarchical clustering (condition tree) was
applied to the data files. In this way, the relationships
between the different groups are shown. The condition
tree was displayed as a heat map, based on expression
levels of the probe sets. Functional and network analyses
of statistically significant gene expression changes
were performed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis
(IPA) 8.0 (Ingenuity® Systems, http://www.ingenuity.
com). Analysis considered all genes from the data set
that met the 2-fold (p-value < 0.05) change cut-off and
that were associated with biological functions in the
Ingenuity Pathways Knowledge Base. The significance
of the association between the data set and the canonical
pathway was measured in 2 ways: 1- Ratio of the number
of genes from the dataset that map to the pathway divided
by the total number of genes that map to the canonical
pathway is displayed; 2- Fisher’s exact test was used
to calculate a p value determining the probability that
the association between the genes in the dataset and the
canonical pathway is explained by chance alone.

Sh-ctr cells, sh-axl pool cells and clone 1, clone 3,
clone 5 and clone 8 were seeded with a concentration of
50 x 10 3 at time 0 and harvested and counted after 24,
48, 72 and 96 hrs. Each day, cells in suspension were
harvested and stained with 0,4% trypan blue for 5 min
at room temperature. Unstained (viable) and stained
(nonviable) cells were counted and the percentage of dead
cells were reported.

Five lentiviral constructs (pLKO.1puro) containing
21-mer short hairpin RNAs (shRNA) directed to various
coding regions of AXL were kindly provided by Prof
Rosamarina Melillo. LOVO cells were transfected with the
pool of shAXL or with non-targeting vectors (shCTR) by
using Fugene reagent following manufacturer’s protocol.
Stable transfectants were selected in medium with 500ng/
mL puromycin for 12 weeks and then amplified.

Migration
Chambers of transwell (6.5 mm diameter, 8 μm
pore size polycarbonate membrane, Corning) were used
to evaluate the migratory capacity of shCTR cells and the
shAXL transfected ones. A cell concentration of 50 x103
cells in 200 μl medium without FBS was added to each
migration (upper) chambers of transwell. Chemotaxis was
induced by addition of 10% FBS to the medium the lower
chamber. Cells were allowed to migrate from the upper
compartment through the membrane towards the lower
compartment along the chemo attractant gradient. After
incubation for 24 hours, non-migrating cells were removed
with cotton swabs, and the cells that migrated into the
lower surface of the filters were stained with crystal violet.

Four- to six-week-old female balb/c athymic
(nu1/ nu1) mice were purchased from Charles River
Laboratories. (Milan, Italy). The research protocol was
approved and mice were maintained in accordance with
the institutional guidelines of the Second University of
Naples Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were
acclimatized at the Second University of Naples Medical
School Animal Facility for 1 week before being injected
with cancer cells and then caged in groups of 8.
All studies were conducted in accordance with the
‘Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals’ (NIH)
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Used
Committee (IACUC).
A total of 2 x106 HCT116 cells re-suspended in 200
μl matrigel (BD Biosciences, Milan, IT): PBS (1:1) were
implanted subcutaneously into the right flank of nude
female mice. Orthotopic in vivo models. The orthotopic
implantation was performed as described by Hoffman and
colleagues (42). After one week mice were randomized and
divided into two different treatment groups treated with
vehicle or foretinib (n° 8 for each group). Group 1: vehicle
(PBS/0,5% Tween 80) was administered through oral
gavage every day, for 5 days a week. Group 2: foretinib
(15 mg/kg) was prepared in vehicle 1 (0.5% Tween-80 in
sterile PBS) and administered daily through oral gavage
for 5 days a week. Mice were treated for three weeks and
euthanized 1 week later. The body weights were monitored
daily. Primary tumours in the cecum were excised and
weighed. Orthotopic implantation: subcutaneous tumours
derived from HCT116 cells were obtained as previously
above. When the average tumours reached a mean volume
of 500 mm3 animals were euthanized, the tumours were
removed using sterile technique, divided into 2-3 mmsized pieces, and harvested in PBS on ice. Mice were
treated with antibiotics, ticarcillin (50 mg kg−1i.v.), two
hours before and after tumour implantation. Animals were
anesthetized with 2,2,2-tribomoethanol 97% TBE, Avertin
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). TBE solution was
prepared fresh daily by mixing 0.625 g of 97% crystalline
TBE powder with 25 ml sterile 0.9% saline and then
injected intraperitoneally at 0.01 ml/g body mass (250
mg/kg). The abdomen was prepped with betadine solution
and the surgical site was isolated in a sterile fashion. A
laparotomy of 0.5 cm was conducted; the cecum was
exteriorized and isolated using pre-cut, sterile gauze. A
warm saline solution was used to keep the cecum wet.
Subsequently, the cecum wall was lightly damaged and
a single tumour fragment from HCT-116 subcutaneous
tumours was sutured to the mesenteric border of the cecum
wall using 6.0 nylon surgical sutures. Upon completion,
the cecum was replaced into the abdominal cavity and
the abdominal wound was sutured using a 6.0 Ethicon

RNA extraction and reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction
For the validation of genes identified by gene
expression profiling, quantitative real-time RT–PCR was
performed on RNA isolated from CRC cells. Total RNA
was collected from cultured cells using the RNeasy Kit
(Qiagen, Crawley, West Sussex, UK) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Random-primed first strand
cDNA was synthesized in a 50 μl reaction volume starting
from 2 μg RNA by using the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core
Kit ( AppliedBiosystems, Warringtone, UK). Quantitative
Q-RT-PCR were performed by using SYBR Green PCR
Master mix (Applied Byosystems) in the iCycler apparatus
(Bio-Rad, Munich, Germany).
The quality of RNA was verified by electrophoresis
through 1% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium
bromide. Primers were designed by using a software
available at http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3/ and synthetized
by the CEINGE s.c.a.r.l. DNA synthetis facility (Naples,
Italy). To exclude DNA contamination, each PCR reaction
was performed on untrascribed RNA. Amplification
reactions (25 μl final reaction volume) contained 200
nM of each primer, 3 mM MgCl2, 300 μM dNTPs, 1x
SYBR Green PCR buffer, 0.1 U/μl AmpliTaq Gold DNA
Polymerase, 0.1 U/μl AMP Erase, RNase-free water and
2 μl cDNA samples. Therma cycling conditions were
optimized for each primer pair and are available upon
request. To verify the absence of non-specific products,
80 cycles of melting (55 °C for 10 sec) were performed. In
all cases, the melting curve confirmed that a single product
was generated. Amplification was monitored by measuring
the increase in fluorescence caused by the SYBR-Green
binding to double-stranded DNA. Fluorescent threshold
values were measured in triplicate and fold changes
were calculated by the formula: 2- (sample 1 DCt –
sample 2 DCt), where DCt is the difference between
the amplification fluorescent thresholds of the mRNA of
interest and the b-actin mRNA.

absorbable stitches. (Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ). The
final tumour was evaluated by caliper measurements using
the following formula: π/6 x larger diameter x (smaller
diameter)2. The presence of metastasis was evaluated in
the peritoneum, liver, intestines, lungs, rectum and spleen
and confirmed by histologic review. The tumour excised
from each mouse was divided into 3 parts. One piece was
formalin-fixed; the other two pieces were frozen at -80 C
in RNAlater. Hematoxylin and eosin staining confirmed
the presence of tumours in each sample. Student t test was
used to evaluate the statistical significance of the results.

FISH analysis
Tissue array sections from paraffin-embedded
tissue were heated for 4 h at 62°C and immediately
deparaffinized in two rinses of 100% xylene for 10 min
each. The slides were then treated with 0.3 M sodium
chloride and 0.03 M sodium citrate for 20 min at 80°C,
and with 0.05 mg/ml proteinase for 10 min at 37°C. AXL/
CEN19q FISH Probe ( FG0088 ABNOVA) (10 ml) was
applied to the tissue sections and covered with a coverslip.
Both probe and target DNA were simultaneously
denatured at 85°C for 5 min and incubated overnight at
37°C using the Hybrite System. Post-hybridization washes
were performed according to the ‘rapid wash protocol’
provided by Vysis. Slides were counterstained with
406-diamidino-2-phenylindole 2HCl (DAPI). FISH was
performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions
(Vysis). FISH data were collected using an Olympus
BX 61 fluorescence microscope equipped with a cooled
black-and-white camera controlled by the associated
software (Olympus, Italy). Signals were evaluated by
two independent evaluators (GL, GB) scoring at least 60
interphase nuclei in four different high power fields (HPF).
The FISH results were scored as follow: specimens with
the ratio AXL/CEN19 ≥ 2.0 were considered as amplified;
polysomic were considered cases showing three or more
CEP-19 signals per cell in more than 30% of the evaluated
cells.

Patients and samples
Histological blocks of 223 patients diagnosed
with CRC, who had undergone surgical resection
without any preoperative treatment between 2003 and
2011, were selected to obtain tissue microarrays upon
informed consent. From the most representative areas of
each donor tissue sample a single core with a diameter
of 2 mm was arranged into one recipient paraffin block
(3×2.5 cm) using a semiautomatic tissue arrayed (Galileo
TMA). All cases were diagnosed at the National Cancer
Institute Fondazione ‘G. Pascale’ of Naples and at Medical
Oncology, Seconda Università degli Studi of Naples and
staged according to the TNM classification (version
dependent on year of diagnosis). Clinicopathological
characteristics including demographics and staging
features were evaluated.

Immunohistochemistry (IHC)
Four μm-thick sections were deparaffinized and
rehydrated and antigen retrieve technique was carried
out in pH 6.0 buffer in a microwave for 3 minutes using
standard histological technique. The primary antibodies
were incubated overnight at 4°C at the concentration
of 10ug/mL for anti-GAS6 (AF885, Goat mAb, R&D
Systems) and 1:300 for anti-AXL (C89E7, Rabbit mAb,
Cell Signaling), washed and then incubated with antiGoat and anti-Rabbit secondary antibodies respectively.
Appropriate positive and negative control were chosen.
Evaluation has been done by two expert pathologists
without prior knowledge of clinicopathological
information (G. L; G.B). The scoring was performed
considering percentage of tumour cells staining positively
(positive and negative). In GAS6 positive samples,
staining results were defined as low (1-19%) and high (
> = 20%). Whereas in AXL positive samples , staining
expression levels were classified into low (1-19%) and
high ( > = 20%) and intensity level was graded as low (1+)
, moderate (2+) or intense (3+). Both in AXL and GAS6
specimens 20% thresholds was chosen according with
median scoring value obtained after statistical analysis.

Statistical analysis
The Student’s t test was used to evaluate the
statistical significance of differences between treatment
effects of in vivo and in vitro data. Differences
between categorical data were measured by χ2 square
test. Differences between continuous variables were
investigated by the Mann-Whitney U test and KruskalWallis test, when appropriate. Survival curves were plotted
using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the
Log-rank test. All the tests were two-sided, with p value
of < 0.05 considered to indicate statistical significance.
All statistical analyses were carried out using the SPSS
package (version 21.0 for Windows, SPSS Inc., USA).
