ABSTRACT:
Innovative therapies are needed for advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). We
have undertaken a genomics based, hypothesis driving, approach to query an emerging potential
that epigenetic therapy may sensitize to immune checkpoint therapy targeting PD-L1/PD-1
interaction. NSCLC cell lines were treated with the DNA hypomethylating agent azacytidine
(AZA - Vidaza) and genes and pathways altered were mapped by genome-wide expression and
DNA methylation analyses. AZA-induced pathways were analyzed in The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) project by mapping the derived gene signatures in hundreds of lung adeno (LUAD) and
squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) samples. AZA up-regulates genes and pathways related to both
innate and adaptive immunity and genes related to immune evasion in a several NSCLC lines.
DNA hypermethylation and low expression of IRF7, an interferon transcription factor, tracks
with this signature particularly in LUSC. In concert with these events, AZA up-regulates PD-L1
transcripts and protein, a key ligand-mediator of immune tolerance. Analysis of TCGA samples
demonstrates that a significant proportion of primary NSCLC have low expression of AZA-induced
immune genes, including PD-L1. We hypothesize that epigenetic therapy combined with blockade
of immune checkpoints – in particular the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway - may augment response of
NSCLC by shifting the balance between immune activation and immune inhibition, particularly
in a subset of NSCLC with low expression of these pathways. Our studies define a biomarker
strategy for response in a recently initiated trial to examine the potential of epigenetic therapy
to sensitize patients with NSCLC to PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade.

INTRODUCTION

produced by low doses of DNA demethylating agents in a
genomics based, pre-clinical approach [17]. These studies
demonstrated how low doses of AZA, which avoid early,
cytotoxic and off-target effects, can provide a memory
for a “reprogramming”-like effect on hematopoietic
and selected examples of solid tumor cells [17]. We
hypothesize in this work that these effects may underlie the
fact that significantly lowering doses of DNMT inhibitors
in the clinic may account for the markedly decreased
toxicity, and significant clinical efficacy, which has led to
FDA approval of AZA for myelodysplasia (MDS) [18].
Initially, we have focused our pre-clinical studies
for low dose AZA on NSCLC. By first deriving genomic
signatures of gene expression responses and DNA
methylation for treated NSCLC lines, we observed in
most cell lines a complex, multi-faceted up-regulation,
involving hundreds of genes of the immune profile
of these cells which includes the target of immune
checkpoint therapy, the tumor ligand PD-L1. Moreover,
using this extensive genomic signature, we have been
able to specifically query hundreds of primary NSCLC
samples in the Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA)
for how basal expression of these immune genes and
related DNA methylation events group lung cancers. We
define a stark clustering of subsets of primary LUAD and
LUSC for an “immune evasion” signature, which relates
highly to events for low interferon pathway signaling and
includes low levels of PD-L1 [20-22]. Low expression of
these genes closely matches those up-regulated by AZA
treatment of the NSCLC cell lines. We hypothesize that
these may be cancers which would benefit from AZA
priming together with immune checkpoint therapy and
outline a signature that may identify predictive biomarkers
from biopsies forthcoming in the current trial.

Innovative strategies are needed to treat the world’s
most common cause of cancer death, non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) [1, 2]. Less than a quarter of lung
adenocarcinomas (LUAD) harbor genetic abnormalities
for which targeted therapies have been derived. Early
responses are often robust for these but are generally
followed by acquired resistance [3, 4]. Lung squamous
cell carcinoma (LUSC) has no approved targeted
therapies and few effective chemotherapeutic options
beyond the first line of therapy. In the current study, we
offer a genomically based, hypothesis-driving analysis to
suggest a rationale for a novel combinatorial therapeutic
approach to efficacious treatments for advanced NSCLC.
The backdrop for the present study comes from our initial
clinical trials in our Stand up to Cancer project (SU2C) in
which patients with advanced, heavily-pretreated NSCLC
received a form of “epigenetic therapy” combining low
doses of the DNA hypomethylating agent azacytidine
(AZA - Vidaza) and the HDAC inhibitor entinostat
[5]. Only two of now 65 patients treated to date have
had RECIST criteria responses to this therapy alone,
but these were very robust and durable (5). A group of
patients followed for 8 to 26 months responded to multiple
different therapeutic regimens given subsequently,
suggesting a “priming” effect of epigenetic therapy (5).
Twenty-five percent of these patients with both LUAD
and LUSC experienced RECIST criteria responses to their
subsequent regimens. These subsequent therapies included
not only standard chemotherapies but also immunotherapy
targeting the PD-1 immune-checkpoint which when given
alone has yielded responses in 16 to 17% of patients with
advanced NSCLC [6-8] (Supp. Fig. 1). While the number
of patients who have received epigenetic therapy followed
by immune checkpoint blockade is small, a clinical
trial to evaluate potential sensitization to PD-1 immune
checkpoint blockade with epigenetic therapy in patients
with NSCLC has now begun.
This trial will be biopsy driven and offer the
opportunity to examine hypotheses generated in the
present pre-clinical work in order to develop biomarker
strategies. In this regard, one of the key therapy agents
being employed in the trial is AZA, a nucleotide analog
DNA demethylating agent which blocks the activity of
all three biologically active DNA methyltransferases
(DNMT’s) and also triggers degradation of these proteins
in the nucleus [9, 10]. With respect to sensitization
potential of this drug for immune responses, such targeting
of DNMT’s is known to induce increased expression of
promoter DNA hypermethylated cancer testes antigens
and also is reported to up-regulate other individual facets
of the tumor immune stimulating profile, including major
histocompatibility antigens, and transcription factors IRF7
and IRF5 [11-16]. In this regard, we previously reported
that elements of such immune pathway activation were

RESULTS
Clinical Data
Six patients who received treatment on a clinical trial
of epigenetic therapy for advanced treatment-refractory
NSCLC were placed on trials for immunotherapy
targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune tolerance checkpoint.
Of these six patients three have experienced durable
partial responses to immunotherapy now ongoing for 14
to 26 months, and the other two had stable disease lasting
8.25 and 8.5 months. (Supp. Fig. 1, Supp. Table 1) For
comparison, 41-46% of NSCLC patients on these two
trials of immunotherapy alone, one for anti-PD1 and the
other for anti-PD-L1 therapy, passed 24 weeks without
progression and16-17% had durable partial response rates
[6-8].

AZA Induced Immune Response in Non-Small
Cell Lung Cancer Cell Lines

between HLA Class I, B2M, CD58, and B7-H3 transcripts
and protein on the cell surface by flow cytometry (Supp.
Fig. 2). Importantly, mutations potentially contributing to
immune evasion have been described in HLA-A in a small
percentage of LUSC and of B2M and CD58 in other tumor
types [26, 27].

We used our previously validated pre-clinical model
to examine how AZA alters expression of key pathways in
NSCLC cell lines [17]. Cells were treated in vitro with 500
nM AZA for 72 hours then harvested immediately after
withdrawal of drug and again one week later for genome
wide methylation and expression studies. To the point
of the clinical suggestion that epigenetic therapy may
provide sensitization to subsequent immune-checkpoint
blockade, we agnostically noted that one or more of the
top ten pathways emerging for each cell line were immune
related. The genes involved are important to the interaction
of both innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity. As
earlier mentioned, other groups have described the ability
of AZA to up-regulate individual immune pathway steps
relative to assembly of major histocompatibility antigens
(HLA Class I), interferon pathway genes, and cancer-testis
antigens [11-16]. However, our current analysis reveals a
more complex, concordant, broad immune gene signature.
Gene Set Enrichment Analysis showed AZA induced upregulation of multiple immune-related pathways in a
manner roughly correlating to the degree of demethylation
in response to AZA treatment (Fig. 1A, Supp. Table 2).
Each of these components has a demonstrated role in
immune tolerance pathways associated with immune
checkpoints and immune evasion. Some of these genes
have low expression associated with cancer-specific
promoter region DNA hyper-methylation, and increased
expression after treatment with DNA demethylating
drugs [11, 12]. In this regard, it is noteworthy that when
compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells, NSCLC is
known to exhibit diminished innate immune responses to
viral-like stimuli involving intertwined pathways of cellintrinsic responses to infection and inflammation [11].

Type I and II Interferon Signaling
A second key issue for immune cell interaction with
tumor cells is that, in vivo, AZA administration to tumorbearing mice has been shown to induce antigen processing
and presentation genes, particularly when administered
with CpG TLR9 agonists, and this is largely attributed to
interferon-γ production by lymphocytes [13]. While the
lymphocyte-specific γ-interferon is not induced in NSCLC
lines with AZA treatment, there is up-regulation of the
interferon-γ receptor (IFNGR1) as well as of multiple
STAT genes, including STAT1, the major IFNGR1 signal
transducer (Fig. 1E).

Programmed Cell Death and Viral Defense
The re-expressed genes in the above mentioned
pathways are downstream targets of interferon response
pathways in a fashion closely linked to pro-inflammatory
and viral defense responses [28-31]. In turn, triggering of
these responses can have both tumor repressing activities,
such as apoptosis, or tumor promoting events and this
paradox has been termed “the dual face” of inflammation
[29, 30, 32]. In this regard, we see key subsets of immune
related genes that are up-regulated by AZA with potential
for inhibiting tumor growth including IFI27, which
encodes a protein triggering apoptosis in late stages of
chronic viral infection[33] (Fig. 1F). Simultaneously,
there is down-regulation of the anti-apoptotic gene,
MAVS, a change which accompanies activation of the
RIG I signaling pathway in response to viral challenge
[30, 31, 34] (Fig. 1H). Downstream events in viral
response include, especially in line H838, simultaneous
increases for expression of BIRC family autophagy genes
and simultaneous decreases in the anti-apoptotic genes
BCL2 and BIRC5 (SURVIVIN) [35] (Fig. 1H). Indeed,
suppression of SURVIVIN is known to be triggered by
the viral induction of IRAK3, which encodes an IL-1
receptor associated kinase [36]. IRAK3 is, again in H838
cells, up-regulated by AZA concordantly with the death
related genes mentioned just above (Fig. 1H). These
dynamics are similar to those for colon cancer cells where
IRAK3 is silenced in association with promoter-region
DNA hypermethylation and when reactivated by induced
demethylation, is associated with SURVIVIN downregulation [36].

Antigen Presentation
A key step in tumor recognition and killing by
cytotoxic T-cells involves recognition of peptides derived
from tumor-specific antigens or up-regulated shared
antigens bound to HLA Class I antigens expressed by the
tumor cells [23]. As recognized by others, AZA increases
expression of multiple cancer testes antigens including
multiple MAGE family genes, whose expression has been
shown to be suppressed by promoter hypermethylation
[14, 15] (Fig. 1G). AZA up-regulates not only transcripts
of HLA Class I antigens but also a series of genes
including, beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), CD58, TAP1, and
the immuno-proteasome subunits PMSB9 and PSMB8
which encode proteins required for endoplasmic reticulum
processing of, transport to, and anchoring to the cell
surface , and recognition of surface HLA class I subunits
[24-26] (Fig. 1D). We find generally good correlation

at the transcript level but also at the cell surface protein
level (Fig. 1B, 1C). Notably, this AZA increase of PDL1 in cell lines is far more consistent than for PD-L2, a
second dendritic cell/macrophage ligand for the CTL
PD-1 receptor, or other checkpoint ligands such as B7H3 and B7-H4 (Fig. 1C). Similarly, CD80 and CD86,
the ligands for CTLA4, another therapeutically targeted
immune checkpoint receptor, are not altered (Fig. 1C).
PD-L1 expression in tumor cells can either be driven by
cell-intrinsic mechanisms or by a process termed adaptive
resistance, through interferon-γ signaling and subsequent

The key to immune checkpoint therapy is antibody
targeting of either the receptor PD-L1 on immune cells
and or the ligand PD-L1 on tumor cells [6, 7, 23]. In
the clinical trials for immune check point blockade to
date involving NSCLC patients, a subset showed no
responses when their tumors did not express cell surface
PD-L1 [6, 7, 23]. In this regard, when treated with AZA,
several NSCLC cell lines up-regulate PD-L1, not only

of functions in cellular pathways recognizing the virus
response element VRE-A to increase transcription of
genes involved in type 1 IFN signaling [11]. There is a
significant association of IRF7 transcription targets with
genes driving several of our GSEA enrichment scores for
the immune pathway alterations observed in response to
AZA (Fig. 3B).

AZA Alters the Immuno-phenotype of NSCLC
Through Its Effect on DNA Methyltransferases
A key issue for all of the above responses is
whether these represent attributes of AZA as a targeted
therapy. In this regard, this drug, particularly at less
toxic doses, specifically targets the three biologically
active DNMT’s, acting to directly inhibit their catalytic
sites and triggering degradation of these proteins in
the nucleus [9, 37]. We thus queried how our complex,
immune-related, pharmacologic responses compare
to simultaneous genetic depletion of two of the three
DNMT’s. We compared HCT116 colon cancer cells and
HCT116 double knock out (DKO) cells that have been
genetically disrupted to give severe haplo-insufficiency of
DNMT1, and complete absence of DNMT3B, enzymes
for DNA methylation maintenance and de novo DNA
methylation, respectively[38]. These cells have lost the
majority of their genome-wide DNA methylation and have
de-methylation of many cancer specific, promoter region,
DNA hypermethylated CpG islands with corresponding
re-expression of genes silenced in the wild type HCT 116
cells [38]. From the standpoint of the present studies, the
immune-related expression alterations in DKO versus
wild type HCT116 are remarkably similar to the AZA
induced changes in NSCLC cells (Fig. 2). We conclude
that previously described off target effects of high dose
AZA including incorporation into RNA and DNA as an
abnormal nucleotide[10] do not appear to be required for
the drug’s effect that we have defined.

Immune-Phenotypes within Histologies in The
Cancer Genome Atlas
From our analysis suggesting IRF7 to be a
potentially important cancer-specific hypermethylation
induced down-regulation event, we sought to create a
list of functionally derived genes closely associated with
its re-expression. Examining H2170, the LUSC cell line
with the greatest up-regulation of IRF7 we hypothesized
that other genes highly up-regulated in this cell line might
be targets of this transcription factor (Fig. 1J). Filtering
expression array data, 114 genes where found to be 4-fold
or more up-regulated in response to AZA in the H2170
(Supp. Table 4). The association of this functionally
derived gene list with IRF7 is confirmed by PScan analysis
(p = 7.6 e -18) (Fig. 3B). These data suggest that IRF7
silencing by DNA methylation in tumors could result in
suppression of immune-regulatory genes important for the
surveillance of tumors by cytotoxic immune mechanisms.
Other studies have reported an immune-evasion signature
dependent on IRF7 in breast and melanoma [40, 43]. To
test if such relation between IRF7 and immune-regulatory
genes exist in primary LUAD and LUSC tumors, we
analyzed the expression of these genes as a function of
IRF7 expression, and its promoter methylation status.
We found that low expression of these genes describes a
subgroup, particularly among LUSC, in TCGA samples
which clusters tightly with high promoter region DNA
methylation and low expression of IRF7 (Figs. 3C, 3D,
and 4). Finally, expression levels of PD-L1, the key tumor
ligand targeted in the anti-checkpoint immunotherapy
trials, tracks quite well with the above immune evasion
signature in subgroups of not only LUSC, but also LUAD,
as especially well visualized in heat maps for individual
immune related pathways, which each track closely with
an immune evasion signature in the LUSC and LUAD,
TCGA samples (Fig. 4).

Up-regulation of Immune Related Transcription
Factors by Azacytidine
In order to find specific genes re-expressed in
response to AZA which may be driving immune-related
changes we extensively filtered our genome wide
expression and methylation data from cell line experiments
to identify transcription factors meeting criteria of
epigenetically re-expressed genes. Approximately 300
genes with high baseline promoter region CpG island
methylation, promoter demethylation of 25% or more
after treatment, and expression increased by log2 0.5 (1.4fold) or greater after treatment (Fig. 3A, Supp. Table 3).
Nearly 17% are in an interferome database[39] (http://
www.interferome.org), and 19% are transcription factors
[39, 40]. The transcription factor IRF7 has been reported
by others to be hypermethylated in cancer, as it is in our
NSCLC line with the lowest basal expression [11, 40-42].
It is up-regulated in response to AZA in several cell lines,
most prominently in the LUSC cell line H2170, showing
a 9-fold increase (Fig. 1J). IRF7 is an upstream activator

DISCUSSION
In the present work, we have used an in-vitro
model to derive a pre-clinical understanding of the
immunomodulatory effects of clinically relevant doses of
AZA in NSCLC that may underpin its potential to “prime”
for subsequent response to PD-1 pathway blockade. We
characterize an AZA induced expression signature of
immune genes and pathways in NSCLC known to play

expression of IRF7-associated genes. TCGA samples are ordered by unsupervised clustering based on genes highly up-regulated in

H2170, which are enriched for IRF7-targets, represented in the topmost heat map. Order of samples is maintained in all lower heat maps.
PD-L1 and IRF7 expression are depicted in the top bar panels as in figure 3D. Supplemental Table 5 table shows the overlaps of genes from
each pathway represented in the heat maps. That the observed clustering pattern is not due to chance or batch effect is demonstrated using

TCGA Samples

a role in the down-regulation of immune surveillance
of cancer. However, concomitant with induction of the
immune genes comprising both innate and adaptive
immunity is the up-regulation of a primary immune
inhibitory ligand, PD-L1. Our data therefore suggest a
mechanism by which epigenetic therapy might improve the
outcome of treatment of patients with NSCLC with PD-1/
PD-L1immune checkpoint blockade. By matching these
basal gene expression and DNA methylation patterns,
including that of a core interferon pathway transcription
factor, IRF7 in the TCGA project, we extrapolate our in
vitro AZA-induced gene signature to hundreds of primary
NSCLC cancers. These results suggest that a major effect
of AZA treatment is the alteration of tumor immune
inducing, pathways that could lead to susceptibility of
tumor cells themselves to immune attack by T cells. In
particular, because the inhibitory ligand PD-L1 is upregulated by AZA in our cell lines, and subsets of primary
tumors have concordant low-expression of AZA induced
immune genes and PD-L1, we suggest that combination
of epigenetic therapy and PD-1 pathway blockade might
produce a synergistic anti-tumor response.
Our findings provide a basis for biomarker
approaches that we will test in a just initiated trial for
patients with advanced LUAD and LUSC, aimed at
validating the promise for sensitization by epigenetic
therapy to immune checkpoint therapy. If we continue
to see robust patient efficacy, our data may prove key to
determining which individuals are likely to benefit from
the epigenetic therapy approaches we are testing in clinical
trials by evaluating gene panels for expression and DNA
methylation in pre-and post- drug administration biopsies.

Level 3 RNA-Seq data (Illumina HiSeq RNA-Seq
platform, Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) were
downloaded for 353 NSCLC samples (129 LUAD / 224
LUSC) and 54 adjacent non-tumor lung tissue samples
from the TCGA Data Portal (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.gov/
tcga/). Similarly, level 1 DNA methylation data (Illumina
Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, Illumina, Inc.,
San Diego, CA, USA) were downloaded for 353 NSCLC
samples (222 LUAD / 149 LUSC) and 74 adjacent nontumor lung tissue samples. Among these, data for 174
NSCLC samples (80 LUAD / 94 LUSC) and 21 adjacent
non-tumor lung tissue samples were available on both of
the above platforms.

RNA-Seq Data Analysis
We used TCGA level 3 RNA-Seq data already
normalized and quantified at gene levels, and presented
as RPKM values (Reads Per Kilobase per Million
mapped reads). To construct heat maps: 1) Values of 0
(indicating no reads observed for a gene) in the RPKM
data were set to NA; 2) the remaining RPKM values were
log 2 transformed; 3) genes from X and Y chromosomes
were removed; and 4) heat maps were made using
the “heatmap.2” function in “gplots” package from
CRAN[44]being centered and scaled in the row direction,
and using the default functions for computing distance
and hierarchical clustering (or being specifically ordered
in column according to the order of other heat maps).
Expression spectrums for individual genes were displayed
in five quartile intervals following the order of associated
heat maps of the RNA-Seq data.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical Data

Infinium DNA Methylation Data Analysis

Institutional review board approved informed
consent signed by each patient allowed the collection of
clinical data following treatment on trial with epigenetic
therapy. Relevant data were obtained by chart review.
Representative images demonstrating responses to
therapy were obtained from computed tomography series
employed in the assessment of patient responses to antiPD1 or anti-PD-L1 directed immune-checkpoint therapy.
Assessment of response to treatment was performed by
a single reference radiologist who employed (RECIST
1.0) to generate measurements for target lesions to be
followed over the course of therapy. Change in target
lesions from baseline (%) is calculated by summing the
diameter of all target lesions at each radiographic tumor
evaluation and calculating percentage change at a given
time point ([(Target Lesion SumTimepoint X/ Target
Lesion SumBaseline)-1]*100).

TCGA level 1 DNA methylation data contain raw
binary intensity data files. Raw data files were imported
into R (http://www.r-project.org) to calculate beta values
(beta value Infinium = M / [U + M], M: mean intensities
of the Methylated bead type, U: mean intensities of the
Unmethylated bead types), M values (M value Infinium
= log 2 [M / U]) and detection p-values (calculated by
comparing probes to negative control probes to determine
if signals are significantly different from the background)
using the “methylumi” package from Bioconductor [45].
Beta values and M values for probes with detection
p-value > 0.05 were considered not significantly different
from background and were masked as NA. TCGA
methylation data were first assessed for batch effects by
principle component analysis (PCA) on the M values. To
accomplish this, data points from X chromosome and Y
chromosome as well as data points that are associated

with SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) were
removed, and the first two principle components are used
for plotting.
Spearman’s correlation coefficients between
methylation (beta value of probe, Illumina Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip) and gene expression
(RPKM value of gene, Illumina HiSeq RNA-Seq
platform) were calculated using TCGA samples with
available data on both platforms. For a particular gene,
only methylation probes that have a negative Spearman’s
correlation coefficient and a adjusted p-value (FDR) for
the coefficient < 0.01 were considered informative and
their relative distances to the corresponding transcriptional
start site (TSS) of the genes were calculated from genomic
coordinates obtained from the UCSC genome browser
(http://genome.ucsc.edu). Heat maps of the M values of
informative probes were made using the “heatmap.2”
function in “gplots” package from CRAN[44] being
centered and scaled in the row direction, and ordered
according to the associated heat maps of the RNA-Seq
data in column and to the relative distances to TSS in row.
For in vitro DNA methylation values, DNA was
extracted from cell lines that were either untreated or
treated with AZA at day 3, at the end of treatment, and
day 10 (7 days post end of treatment) and analyzed by
the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChips
(Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Raw data were
imported into R using the “methylumi” package from
Bioconductor [45]. Data points for probes with detection
p-value > 0.05 were masked as NA. Δ beta values (Δ
beta value = beta value AZA – beta value Mock) were
calculated and used to make boxplots. Heat maps were
made similarly like those for the TCGA data using
informative probes defined by the TCGA data.

For each of the eight lung cancer cell lines (H838,
H1299, H358, H1270, A549, H460, HCC4006, HCC827)
a ranked gene list was created (genes were sorted by
decreasing M value). These eight ranked gene lists were
entered in the GSEA tool[47, 48]and the enrichment of
both Kegg [49] and Reactome[50] pathways in these
lists was calculated (default parameters). A gene set was
selected when it was enriched in any of the eight cell
lines (p value < 0.05 and false discovery rate < 0.25). The
normalized enrichment scores (NES) for the gene sets in
each cell line were used to create the heat maps. When a
certain gene set was not significant in a cell line, it was
assigned a NES of 0.

Transcription Factor Analysis
Expression and methylation data were analyzed
to find genes whose re-expression was linked to
demethylation after AZA treatment. Genes were selected
based on a set of cut-offs, both for the methylation and
expression values: A gene was considered to be reexpressed when at day 3 or day 10 the median M value
of all the probes linked to that gene was higher than 0.5.
Infinium probes were analyzed separately at their distances
from the transcription start site for each gene examined.
For a probe to be called demethylated, it had to have a
beta value higher than 0.5 in the mock treatment and a
difference in beta value between mock and AZA treatment
had to be at least 0.25. Only probes that were associated
with a CpG island and that were located within 1000 bp
upstream and 1000 bp downstream of the transcription
start site were used in the analyses. The probes that passed
these filters were validated using the TCGA methylation
and expression data (see the definition of informative
probes in the “Infinium DNA Methylation Data” section of
Methods). Only genes that had an expression-methylation
correlation value < -0.25 and a false discovery rate <
0.05 were retained. To better understand the biological
implications of the re-expressed genes, the gene lists
were searched for transcription factors. Two human
transcription factor lists obtained from Ravasi et al [51]and
Vaquerizas et al [52, 53] were combined and the resulting
list was matched to the lists of demethylated and reexpressed genes. The targets of IRF7 from the list of genes
that are 4-fold or more up-regulated in H2170 by AZA
were similarly identified using the TranscriptomeBrowser
database [54].

Expression Microarray Data
For in-vitro RNA extracted from cell lines treated
with AZA, analyses were done at exactly the same time
points as for DNA methylation above. Analyses from wild
type colon cancer, HCT116 cells, and genetic knockout
counterparts for DNA methyltransferases (DKO cells)
were also performed. Expression microarrays were
carried out using Agilent Human 4× 44K expression arrays
(Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA, Cat#:
G4112F). Within-array and between - array normalization
was performed using Loess and Aquantile normalization,
respectively[46]. Median of the M values (M value
Expression = log 2 [AZA / Mock] OR log 2 [DKO /
HCT116]) was determined for multiple probes associated
with the same gene.

Flow Cytometry Methods (FACS)

single-cell suspension were then stained with fluorescentlabeled antibodies for 15 minutes at room temperature.
Each sample was washed twice and re-suspended in
flow-washing buffer and analyzed by FACSCalibur.
The following antibodies were used: CD274 (12-598342 Ebiosciences), HLA abc (12-9983-42 Ebiosciences),
CD276(331606 Biolegend), CD119(558934 BD), B2
microblogumin(551337BD), CD58(555921BD). Changes
between AZA treated and mock cells are calculated using
mean fluorescence intensities (MFI) and the formula
log2([(MFIantibody, treated)-(MFIisotype, treated)]/ [(MFIantibody, mock)(MFIisotype, mock)]).
