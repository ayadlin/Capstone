ABSTRACT
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) represents expansion of cells
arrested at specific stages of thymic development with the underlying genetic
abnormality often determining the stage of maturation arrest. Although their outcome
has been improved with current therapy, survival rates remain only around 50% at
5 years and patients may therefore benefit from specific targeted therapy. Interleukin
receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK1) is a ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine
kinase that mediates signaling downstream to Toll-like (TLR) and Interleukin-1
Receptors (IL1R). Our data demonstrated that IRAK1 is overexpressed in all subtypes
of T-ALL, compared to normal human thymic subpopulations, and is functional in
T-ALL cell lines. Genetic knock-down of IRAK1 led to apoptosis, cell cycle disruption,
diminished proliferation and reversal of corticosteroid resistance in T-ALL cell lines.
However, pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1 using a small molecule inhibitor
(IRAK1/4-Inh) only partially reproduced the results of the genetic knock-down.
Altogether, our data suggest that IRAK1 is a candidate therapeutic target in T-ALL
and highlight the requirement of next generation IRAK1 inhibitors.

effective in T-ALL [8–10].Therefore, efficient evaluation
of their potential therapeutic impact requires their use in
subsets of patients that are most likely to benefit.
Interleukin receptor associated kinase (IRAK1) is a
ubiquitously expressed serine/threonine kinase that mediates
signal transduction downstream to Toll-like (TLRs) and
Interleukin-1 Receptors (IL1R) [11]. Receptor activation
results in phosphorylation of IRAK1 on threonine 209
which initiates recruitment of TRAF6, thus activating
downstream NF-κB and MAPK pathways [12]. An
oncogenic role for IRAK1 has recently been reported in
myeloid cancers [13]. IRAK1 transcriptional expression has
negative prognostic impact in Myelodysplasic syndromes
(MDS) and acute myeloid leukemias (AML). Furthermore

INTRODUCTION
T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an
aggressive hematological malignancy resulting from the
transformation of T-cell progenitors at various stages of
development. They represent 10% of pediatric and 25% of
adult ALL. Despite improvement in therapeutic protocols
that cure nearly 80% children and 50% adults, relapse is
common and the prognosis of relapsed T-ALL remains
extremely poor [1, 2]. T-ALL oncogenesis results from
chromosomal rearrangements, somatic genetic mutations,
aberrant oncogene expression and impairment of multiple
signaling pathways involving kinases [3–7]. Interestingly,
the use of several kinase inhibitors has been shown to be

in vivo targeted inhibition of IRAK1 in a xenograft model
of MDS demonstrated survival improvement [13, 14].
Oncogenic activation of the TLR/IL1R pathway is found
in several B-cell lymphomas, often in conjunction with the
MYD88 L265P gain of function mutation [15] and 100% of
primary effusion lymphoma harbor IRAK1 gain of function
mutations leading to constitutive IRAK1 activation [16].
An IRAK1/4 inhibitor was also effective in MYD88 L265P
mutated diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [17, 18].
We recently investigated the transcriptional
expression of receptor and receptor-associated kinases
in T-ALL by Taqman low density array (TLDA) [8]. We
showed the overexpression of several kinases as compared
to their normal thymic counterparts, demonstrating that
exploration of the receptor kinome defines a rational
strategy for testing kinase inhibition in T-ALL. These data
showed that IRAK1 was strongly overexpressed in all
categories of T-ALL so we sought to further explore the
potential role of IRAK1 as a therapeutic target in T-ALL.

IL-1β-induced IRAK1 increased phosphorylation was
specifically observed in cell lines harboring basal IRAK1
phosphorylation (Jurkat and ALL-SIL T-cell lines) but not
in HPB-ALL and DND-41, which express IRAK1 proteins
without basal phosphorylation (Figure 2C right panel).
Taken together, these data suggest that IRAK1
is robustly expressed in T-ALL at both transcriptional
and protein levels, and remains functional in at least a
significant subset of cases.

Knock-down of IRAK1 induces apoptosis and
disrupts cell cycle in T-ALL
To test whether IRAK1 is required for T-ALL
survival, we transduced short hairpin RNAs (shRNA)
targeting IRAK1 into T-ALL cell lines. Two independent
shRNA (543 and 544) significantly downregulated IRAK1
protein expression in several cell lines (representative data
for Jurkat, Figure 3A). Depletion of IRAK1 with both
shRNA induced a dramatic decrease in T-cell proliferation
(Figure 3B) and increase in apoptosis and cell cycle
disruption by increasing the G0/G1 and decreasing the
S  phase cells in both HPB-ALL and Jurkat cell-lines
(Figure 3C and 3D).

RESULTS
IRAK1 is overexpressed and functional in T-ALL
Transcriptional analysis of the expression level of
65 receptor and receptor-associated kinases in 32 T-ALL
(test series) and normal thymic subsets (cell-sorting
described in Supplementary Figure S1) showed that IRAK1
was the most highly expressed kinase in all categories of
T-ALL, regardless of the immunogenetic stage of arrest
or underlying recurrent oncogenetic abnormalities,
including Notch1 pathway mutations (Figure 1). We
used qPCR to validate the transcriptional pattern of
IRAK1 in sorted normal thymic subsets, in T-ALL cell
lines, and in a large series of 177 independent (validation
series) primary human T-ALL. This confirmed IRAK1
overexpression in T-ALL and cell lines as compared to
normal thymus (p < 0.01, Figure 2A). IRAK1 transcript
levels were slightly higher in most mature TCRab lineage
thymic subpopulations as compared to immature and
mature TCRgd subsets, without statistical significance
(Figure 2A). No difference was observed between mature
and immature T-ALL subtypes (Figure 2A) or oncogenic
subtypes (not shown) suggesting ubiquitous oncogenic
IRAK-1 deregulation in T-ALL, irrespective of stage of
maturation arrest and/or oncogenic deregulation.
The IRAK1 protein was also widely expressed
in cell lines and primary T-ALL blasts, with a trend
to overexpression as compared to normal thymus
(Figure  2B). IRAK1 was constitutively phosphorylated
on residue T209 at variable levels in lymphoblastic T-cell
lines and primary T-ALLs and to a lesser extent in normal
human thymus (Figure 2B). In addition, IRAK1 T209phosphorylation increased over time in the Jurkat T-cell
line upon IL-1β stimulation, suggesting a functional
IRAK1 pathway (Figure 2C, left panel). Of note, the

Knock-down of IRAK1 reverses resistance to
corticosteroids in Jurkat
Resistance to corticosteroids remains one of the most
challenging issues in ALL therapy. As previously reported
[19], the Jurkat cell line is resistant to corticosteroids
(Figure 4A). To assess whether knock-down of IRAK1
could reverse this resistance, we tested the effects of
dexamethasone in Jurkat after genetic IRAK1 inactivation.
Dexamethasone induced apoptosis was significantly
increased in cells transduced with IRAK1 shRNA as
compared to control cells (Figure 4A). A similar effect
was observed on cell proliferation (Figure 4B). In order
to confirm these data, we then performed assays with a
broader range of dexamethasone doses tested on a p-IRAK
positive (Jurkat) and a p-IRAK negative (HPB-ALL)
T-ALL cell line with simultaneous genetic knockdown
of IRAK-1 using shRNA544 (Figure  4C). These data
demonstrated that the corticosteroid response reversion
is specifically observed in p-IRAK1 positive cells
(Figure 4C). Altogether these data support that knockdown
of IRAK1 could sensitize corticosteroid resistant p-IRAK1
positive T-ALL to dexamethasone therapy.

Pharmacological inhibition only partially
reproduces the effects of genetic knock-down
We then submitted Jurkat, to increasing doses of
the previously reported pharmacological inhibitor of
IRAK1 (IRAK1/4-Inh) [20, 21]. A significant decrease
in phosphorylation of IRAK1 was observed after 48 h

and the decrease in proliferation induced in the Jurkat
cell-line upon IRAK1 inhibition were not as dramatic
with the pharmacologic inhibition as with the genetic
knockdown (Figure 5B and 5C). However, these

effects remained significant compared to the HPBALL p-IRAK1 negative cell-line (Figure 5D) and are
consistent with previously reported data on MDS/
AML [13]. To confirm these data, we finally performed
pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1 in two primary
T-ALL samples (T-ALL3 and T-ALL4). Similarly,

DISCUSSION

we observed a significant increase in cell apoptosis of
primary T-ALL samples upon pharmacological inhibition
of IRAK1/4 (Figure 5E). Taken together, genetic knockdown and, to a lesser extent, pharmacological inhibition
of IRAK1 both resulted in decreased proliferation and
induction of apoptosis in the Jurkat cell-line and primary
T-ALL blasts.

Improving prognosis remains a therapeutic
challenge in T-ALL. Kinases have recently been shown
to be druggable targets in T-ALL, particularly in Early
T-precursor (ETP)-ALL, a very immature subtype with
myeloid features which is associated with a high risk

of induction failure or relapse and a poor outcome [22].
Indeed, kinases play a key role in signaling pathways
downstream to cytokine receptors that are important in
T-ALL and central to ETP ALL oncogenesis [3]. We have
now identified IRAK1 as a novel candidate kinase for
targeted therapy in T-ALL, including ETP-ALL. IRAK1/4
inhibitor was originally developed for autoimmune and
inflammatory diseases [20], and was effective in-vitro
and in-vivo in hematological malignancies (MDS, AML,
DLBCL) that overactivate the IRAK1 pathway [13, 18],
albeit to a lesser extent. These data in T-ALL underline the
requirement of new and more efficient IRAK1 inhibitor
for clinical use in leukemia therapeutics.
Our data support that inhibition of IRAK1 activity
result in corticoresistance reversion, only in the context
of constitutive activation of IRAK1. The unexpected
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

observation that pharmacological inhibition of IRAK1
could not result in comparable cytotoxicity to genetic
knock-down of IRAK1 raises the possibility that the
cellular oncogenic effects of IRAK1 may not be entirely
mediated through its kinase domain. There is precedent
for this in alternative disease models, such as the FLT3
receptor which displays both kinase-dependent and
independent effects. One mechanism accounting for
primary resistance to pharmacological FLT3 inhibition
appears to be related to the maintenance of kinaseindependent effects of FLT3 upon TKD exposure,
with active recruitment of signaling molecules on
Grb2 and downstream overexpression of MCL1,
thereby maintaining oncogenic FLT3 activity [23].
Interestingly, previous studies showed that kinase-dead
IRAK1 mutants maintain IL1-mediated NF-kB and

MAPK activation, suggesting that the kinase domain
of IRAK1 may be dispensable for the activation of
some physiological downstream signaling mediators
[24–26]. Whether the present discrepancy between
genetic and pharmacological inhibition results from
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

kinase-independent signaling remains to be addressed.
However, the exact sequence of molecular events
following IRAK1 activation is not fully deciphered and
kinase-related and kinase-independent effects remain
controversial [27].

We identified deregulation of IRAK1 in all T-ALL
subsets but the molecular mechanism(s) of overexpression
and constitutive activation in hematological malignancies
has not been addressed so far. It may result from posttranscriptional deregulation by miRNA such as miR-146,
which targets IRAK1 mRNA [28]. The role of IRAK1 in
normal thymopoïesis and in T-ALL pathogenesis should
be further investigated. It has been shown that the NF-κB
pathway is activated and can be targeted in T-ALL [29].
In this context, targeting IRAK1 may represent a new
approach to inhibit the NF-κB pathway preferentially in
leukemic compared to normal lymphoid precursors.
In conclusion, our study identifies IRAK1 as a
potential novel target in T-ALL, particularly in corticoresistant T-ALL and ETP-ALL but optimal therapeutic
intervention will require development of next generation
IRAK1 inhibitors and their preliminary evaluation in
in-vivo tests and mouse xenograft models of T-ALL.

T-ALL were co-cultured on OP9-DL1 in a α-MEM media
supplemented with 20% FBS (Hyclone ; Thermo Fisher
Scientific), 50 μg/ml streptomycin , 50 IU penicillin and
recombinant human cytokines hFLT3-L (5 ng/mL), hIL-7
(2 ng/mL) and hSCF (10 ng/mL) (Miltenyi).

Reagents
The IRAK1 inhibitor (IRAK1/4 inhibitor or IRAKInh; Amgen Inc.) was purchased from Merck Millipore
(Ref 407602). Recombinant human IL1-β was purchased
from Miltenyi (Ref 130-093-897).

Apoptosis, cell cycle analysis and growth curves
Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry using
Annexin V APC (and propidium iodide (BD-Pharmingen,
San Jose, CA, USA) staining.
Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow
cytometry using EdU/7-AAD staining purchased from
Invitrogen, as per manufacturer recommendations.
Cell viability was measured with trypan blue
exclusion using a Hemocytometeror an automated cell
counter (CASY, Roche Diagnostics).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Diagnostic peripheral blood or bone marrow
samples from 177 adults with T-ALL were analyzed after
informed consent was obtained at diagnosis according
to the Declaration of Helsinki. Patients were included
in the GRAALL03/05 trials, both were registered at
ClinicalTrials.gov (GRAALL-2003, NCT00222027;
GRAALL-2005, NCT00327678).
Normal thymic samples were obtained from children
undergoing cardiac surgery at the Necker-Enfants Malades
Hospital, with informed consent from the parents.

Western blotting
T-ALL cell lines and primary T-ALL cells at
diagnosis were washed in PBS and lysed in HNTG
buffer (50mM Hepes pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 50mM NaF,
1mM EDTA, 1% Triton, 10% glycerol, 1.5 mM MgCl2)
supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors
(Halt Protease and Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail, Thermo
scientific). Protein was separated by 7.5% SDS-PAGE
(MiniProtean, Biorad) and transferred onto nitrocellulose
membranes. After blocking 1 h in TBST 5% BSA,
membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with the
first Ab in blocking buffer. Primary Abs used were: antipIRAK1 T209 (1/500, Assay Biotech) anti-IRAK1 (1/1000,
Cell Signaling) and anti-ACTIN (1/1000, Santa Cruz).
After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature with the appropriate
secondary Ab coupled to HRP in blocking buffer. The
signal was detected using the WestDura supersignal or
WestFemto supersignal kit (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences).

Molecular analysis (Taqman Low Density Array
and real-time quantitative PCR)
Quantification of kinase expression was performed
on quality-controlled cDNA using predesigned TaqMan
Low Density microfluidic cards (TLDA Human Protein
Kinase Array; Applied Biosystems). Samples with
GAPDH cycle thresholds superior to 21 were excluded
from analysis. Each probe value was normalized with
respect to GAPDH copy number and analyzed with a Δ13
cycle threshold to discard background noise.
IRAK1 transcript expression was quantified by
real-time quantitative PCR in an unselected series of 177
T-ALLs with available cDNA.

Knock-down of IRAK1 with shRNA lentivirus
Two independent and validated pLKO.1-shIRAK1
constructs developed by Rhyasen et al [13] were used
(TRCN0000000543 and TRCN0000000544).

Cell lines and culture conditions
The JURKAT, MOLT-4, ALL-SIL, DND-41,
and HPB-ALL T cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640
supplemented with 50 μg/mL streptomycin, 50 IU
penicillin, 2 mM L-glutamine and 20% fetal bovine serum
(10% for JURKAT). Cell cultures were maintained at 37°C
