SUMMARY

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We report a paracrine effect whereby endothelial cells (ECs) promote the cancer stem cell (CSC)
phenotype of human colorectal cancer (CRC) cells. We showed that, without direct cell-cell
contact, ECs secrete factors that promoted the CSC phenotype in CRC cells via Notch activation.
In human CRC specimens, CD133 and Notch intracellular domain-positive cells co-localized with
CRC cells in perivascular regions. An EC-derived, soluble form of Jagged-1, via ADAM17
proteolytic activity, led to Notch activation in CRC cells in a paracrine manner; these effects were
blocked by immunodepletion of Jagged-1 in EC conditioned medium or blockade of ADAM17
activity. ECs play an active role in promoting Notch signaling and the CSC phenotype by
secreting soluble Jagged-1.

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States,
with ~50,000 patients dying each year due to metastatic disease refractory to systemic
therapy (ACS, 2010; Davies and Goldberg, 2008; Davies and Goldberg, 2011). Although
there are now six Food and Drug Administration approved drugs for the treatment of

metastatic CRC, median overall survival remains less than 2 years (Davies and Goldberg,
2011). Targeted therapies, including anti-angiogenic therapies, have not dramatically
improved clinical outcomes of patients with metastatic CRC (Saltz et al., 2008). A better
understanding of the biology of CRC is imperative for the development of more effective
therapeutic approaches that can benefit CRC patients.
There is evidence for the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in CRC (Barker et al., 2009;
Du et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2009; O'Brien et al., 2007; Ricci-Vitiani et al., 2007). Because
of the intrinsic stem cell-like properties of CSCs, this sub-population of tumor cells is
believed to not only initiate and sustain tumor growth but also mediate chemoresistance (AlHajj, 2007; Wicha et al., 2006). Notably, a number of studies suggest that CSCs exist in a
state of flux and the CSC phenotype can be enhanced by microenvironmental influences
(Butler et al., 2010a; Rosen and Jordan, 2009). Therefore, the development of CSC- and/or
microenvironment-targeting strategies that could eliminate the CSC population is critical for
improving the clinical outcomes of CRC patients.

Several groups have reported that tumor progenitor cells reside in perivascular niches in
certain types of cancers (Butler et al., 2010a; Calabrese et al., 2007; Krishnamurthy et al.,
2010). Whether perivascular niches of CSCs exist in other solid tumors, including CRCs, is
yet unclear. More importantly, how ECs function to establish and maintain tumor-initiatingcell niches remains to be further elucidated. Understanding the mechanisms by which ECs
promote the CSC phenotype will provide the foundation for the development of novel and
refined CSC-targeting approaches. The purpose of this study was to understand the role of
ECs in mediating the CSC phenotype of CRC cells and the mechanism by which this occurs.

RESULTS
Co-culture With ECs Promotes the Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype of CRC Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to understand tumor-EC cross-talk, and particularly the potential role of ECs in
promoting the CSC phenotype of CRC cells, we first conducted a co-culture experiment. We
used freshly isolated human CRC cells from surgical specimens after a establishing a first
passage xenograft in mice (xhCRC) to expand the number of cells. We also used freshly
isolated liver parenchyma ECs (LPECs) labeled with GFP-Luc/mCherry in tissue culture.
After co-culture for three days, xhCRC cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) and analyzed for potential enrichment of the population with CSC
characteristics. As shown in Figure 1A, co-culture with LPECs increased the fraction of
xhCRC cells that were Aldefluor-positive, a population presumably enriched for CSCs
(Huang et al., 2009). Similarly, co-culture of LPECs with CRC cells increased the percent of
cells that were CD133 positive (Figure 1B). Co-culture with LPECs also increased the
percentage of xhCRC cells with in vitro sphere-forming ability (4-fold, p<0.05, Figure 1C).
Collectively, these data suggest that ECs could promote the CSC phenotype of co-cultured
CRC cells ex vivo. Similar results were also obtained from in vitro experiments with the
established human CRC cell line HCT116 and immortalized human umbilical vein
endothelial cell line RF24 (Figure S1A–B).
Endothelial Cell Conditioned Medium Promotes the Cancer Stem Cell Phenotype of CRC
Cells
To determine if the effect observed above required the direct cell-cell contact or if it is
mediated by soluble factors secreted by ECs, we cultured freshly isolated human CRC
(hCRC) cells in conditioned medium obtained from freshly isolated LPECs, or control
medium (MEM containing 1%FBS); after exposure to the CM, hCRC cells were analyzed
for the CSC phenotype. Compared to control medium, LPEC CM enriched the Aldefluor-

positive hCRC cell population by 16-fold (Figure 1D), and enriched the CD133-positive
hCRC cell population by 7-fold (Figure 1E), after 72 of hrs treatment. In addition, LPEC
CM treatment also enriched sphere-forming capability of hCRC cells by over 6-fold (Figure
1F). Upon serial passaging, hCRC cells treated with LPEC CM demonstrated significantly
greater capability (10–15 fold increase) to form secondary and tertiary tumor spheres
(Figure 1F). We were able to obtain similar results from established CRC cell lines
(HCT116 and HT29) treated with CM collected from established endothelial cell lines
(RF24 and HDMECs), or LPECs (Figure S1C–D). As important controls, CM obtained from
freshly isolated human CRC cells, established CRC cell lines (HCT116 and HT29), or
fibroblasts were not able to significantly enrich the CSC population in CRC cells (data not
shown). Taken together, these data suggest that EC-derived soluble factor(s) can promote
the CSC phenotype of CRC cells in a paracrine manner.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We next sought to understand whether ECs promote the colorectal CSC phenotype either by
converting a subset of CRC cells into CSCs or by expanding the CSC population. We sorted
xhCRC cells by the Aldefluor assay, and treated Aldefluor-high, -middle, and -low fractions
with LPEC CM in parallel; the Aldefluor assay was repeated to determine which ALDH
population could be enriched for CSCs by EC CM. Interestingly, we found that the CSC
population enrichment only occurred in the Aldefluor-middle population, but not in
Aldefluor-high (presumably CSCs) or -low populations (presumably terminally
differentiated cells) (Figure 1G). Similar results were obtained using another colorectal CSC
marker, CD133, as the readout (Figure 1H). These data suggest that the EC CM mediated
promotion of the CSC phenotype is primarily achieved in non-stem CRC cells that retain
cellular plasticity. We also assessed levels of intestinal differentiation marker expression
using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (q-RT-PCR), and found
that LPEC CM treatment significantly reduced the expression of Keratin 20 (KRT20) by 8fold in hCRC cells (Figure S1E); In addition, we tested the expression levels of additional
differentiation markers, ANPEP and PRSS7, and found that their expression levels, while
easily detectable by qRT-PCR in cells treated with control CM, they were not detectable in
the LPEC CM treated group. These findings indicate that LPEC CM promotes the colorectal
CSC phenotype by inducing de-differentiation in a subset of non-stem CRC cells.
Endothelial Cell Conditioned Medium Promotes Tumorigenicity and Metastasis of CRC
Cells In Vivo

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A critical experiment for determining the CSC phenotype is the in vivo tumorigenicity assay
by serial dilution (Clarke et al., 2006). Therefore, we sought to validate our in vitro findings
by using an in vivo model. To this end, CRC cells pretreated with either EC CM or control
CM were serially diluted and injected subcutaneously into mice, and tumorigenicity was
determined. LPEC CM pretreated HT29 cells led to earlier tumor formation, as well as
greater tumor incidence and growth, compared with control (HT29 CM pretreated) cells
(Figure 2A). Similar results were obtained when we compared the effect of RF24 CM on
HCT116 tumorigenicity (data not shown). We further extended our study using serial
passaging of cells in xenograft experiments with freshly isolated xenografted hCRC
(xhCRC) cells, combined with limited dilution, and found that xhCRC cells pretreated with
LPEC CM demonstrated significantly increased tumorigenicity compared with those
pretreated with control medium, in both primary and secondary xenografts (Figure 2B).
We also investigated the effect of EC CM on the metastatic potential of CRC cells. First we
employed a tail vein injection, and found that, compared to control (HCT116 CM treated)
cells, RF24 CM treated HCT116 CRC cells formed significantly more metastases (Figure
S2A–B). We then used a splenic injection model to induce liver metastasis, the most
common site of CRC metastasis. Compared with xhCRC cells treated with control medium,
xhCRC cells treated with LPEC CM demonstrated an increased incidence of liver metastasis

(9 out of 10 in the LPEC CM pretreatment group, compared with 3 out of 10 in the control
group. p<0.05) (Figure 2C), and significantly increased tumor burden, demonstrated by an
increase in luciferase activity (Figure 2D), and a 57% increase in liver weight (photographs
in Figure 2C) (Figure S2C, p<0.05). Collectively, these data demonstrated that EC-derived
soluble factor(s) promote the metastatic potential of CRC cells injected in the spleen.
CD133 Positive CRC Cells Are Located Adjacent to ECs in Human Surgical Specimens

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having established that ECs secrete soluble factors to enrich CRC cells for CSC phenotype,
we sought to determine whether CRC cells that express the CSC marker CD133 are located
in the perivascular regions in human CRC surgical specimens. Immunofluorescent staining
for CD133 and CD31 (endothelial cell marker) was carried out in primary colon cancer
specimens and chemotherapy-naive human CRC liver metastases. CD133 staining identified
CRC cells that were located in proximity to CD31-positive ECs (Figure 2E). Further
staining confirmed that these CD133+ cells were not pericytes or stroma cells since CD133
staining did not co-stain with desmin (a pericyte marker) (Figures S2D), nor did they costain with smooth muscle actin (a marker of stroma and pericytes), CD3 (a marker of T cells
and lymphocytes), CD68 (a marker of monocytes and macrophages), or myeloperoxidase (a
marker of myeloid cells) (Figure S2E–H). In addition, we co-stained with antibodies to
CD133 and EPCAM (an epithelial marker), and demonstrated co-localization of these
markers (Figure S2I). Cumulatively, these immune-staining data show that in clinical
specimens, the CD133 positive cells are epithelial in origin and not stromal in origin. These
data support our preclinical data suggesting that ECs can mediate the colorectal CSC
phenotype in clinical specimens.
Endothelial Cell Conditioned Medium Promotes Chemoresistance of CRC Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Preclinical studies suggest that CSCs possess intrinsic properties that mediate their
resistance to chemotherapy (Al-Hajj, 2007; Dallas et al., 2009; Wicha et al., 2006). We
therefore hypothesized that CRC cells pretreated with EC CM would exhibit resistance to
chemotherapeutic agents. To test this hypothesis, HCT116 CRC were exposed to oxaliplatin
(2µM) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU, 2µg/ml) in RF24 CM or control medium for 96 hrs;
chemosensitivity was determined by MTT assay. Compared with cells that were pretreated
with control medium, HCT116 cultured in RF24 CM demonstrated a significantly higher
survival rate after oxaliplatin or 5-FU treatment (~3 fold) (Figures 3A). Similarly, LPEC
CM treatment for 72 hrs led to chemoresistance of xhCRC cells (Figure 3C). To further
validate the chemo-protective effect of EC CM on tumor cells, chemotherapy-induced
apoptosis in HCT116 cells was assessed after the cells were treated with chemotherapy
while cultured in EC CM or control HCT116 CM for 48 hrs. Annexin V staining
demonstrated a significant decrease of apoptotic events in the HCT116 cells treated with
oxaliplatin or 5-FU after culture in LPEC CM (28% to 6% with oxaliplatin treatment, and
43% to 15% with 5-FU treatment, respectively, data not shown). Western blot analysis
showed lower levels of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) and cleaved Caspase 3
in HCT116 cells treated with oxaliplatin or 5-FU while cultured in RF24 CM compared to
control CM (Figure 3B). Similar results were observed in xhCRC treated with 5-FU while
cultured in LPEC CM (Figure 3D).
Endothelial Cell Conditioned Medium Activates the Notch Pathway in CRC Cells In Vitro
To understand the underlying mechanism by which EC CM promotes the CSC phenotype of
CRC cells, we sought to examine the activation of canonical CSC pathways such as Notch
(Katoh, 2007), Wnt/beta-catenin (Vermeulen et al., 2010), and Sonic hedgehog (Saif and
Chu, 2010) in CRC cells treated with EC CM. To this end, we infected HT29 cells with a
lentivirus containing a Hes-1 promoter-driven reporter (Jarriault et al., 1995), TCF reporter,
or a Gli reporter (Limgala, 2009), and treated the cells with LPEC CM or control CM. LPEC

CM treatment led to significantly increased activity of the Hes-1 reporter but not the Gli or
TCF reporter (Figure 4A). Using the identical luciferase reporter assays, we also observed
increased Hes-1 promoter activity in xhCRC cells treated with LPEC CM (Figure 4B) and
HCT116 cells treated with RF24 CM (Figure S3A). In addition, we found that following EC
CM treatment, protein levels of Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes-1 in CRC cells
were significantly increased (Figures 4C and S3B–C). These data suggest that EC CM
activates Notch signaling in CRC cells.
To determine whether Notch activation is indeed responsible for the promotion of the
colorectal CSC phenotype by EC CM, gamma secretase inhibitor X (GSI), which inhibits
the liberation of NICD, was added to RF24 CM during treatment of the CRC cells. GSI
treatment blocked EC CM induced Notch signaling activation and CSC enrichment, as
demonstrated by the suppression of both NICD up-regulation and Aldefluor-positive cell
population increase (Figures S3D–E).
CRC Cells Adjacent to ECs in Human Specimens Demonstrate Activation of Notch
Signaling

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Having established that ECs secrete soluble factors to activate Notch signaling, we sought to
determine whether CRC cells located in perivascular regions in human tumor samples
displayed Notch activation. Immunofluorescent staining for NICD and CD31 was carried
out in human CRC surgical specimens. We found that tumor cells expressing NICD were
predominantly located in the perivascular region (Figure 4D). These NICD+ cells are not
pericytes since NICD staining does not overlap with desmin staining (Figures S3F).
Furthermore, co-immunofluorescent staining of CD133 and NICD highlighted the colocalization of CD133-positive and NICD-positive CRC cells in the perivascular niches
(Figure 4E).
ECs Secrete a Soluble Form of Jagged-1 to Promote the CSC Phenotype in CRC Cells

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Since the Notch signaling pathway in CRC cells was activated by soluble factors in EC CM,
we sought to identify the molecules that activate Notch signaling. Although Notch activation
is thought to occur exclusively via a juxtacrine mechanism, some studies reported on the
presence of soluble Notch ligands with variable effects on Notch signaling (Hukriede and
Fleming, 1997; Nickoloff et al., 2002; Sun and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 1997). Although in
contrast to the classic view of Notch activation, our studies suggested the presence of a
soluble Notch ligand that was an activator of Notch signaling. Therefore, we examined the
presence of the known Notch-1 ligands DLL4 and Jagged-1 in EC CM using western blot
analysis. Our results showed that DLL4 was not differentially secreted by CRC cells and
ECs, but a significantly greater amount of Jagged-1 (N-terminus antibody) was detected in
LPEC and RF24 CM compared to that in HT29 and HCT116 CM (Figure 5A and S4A).
Since Notch-activating Jagged-1 is usually membrane bound, we sought to determine if the
Jagged-1 in EC CM was associated with microvesicles. Even after depletion of
microvesicles, Jagged-1 could still be detected in the RF24 CM supernatant (Figure S4B),
suggesting that the Jagged-1 found in EC CM is not anchored on microvesicles.
To determine if this soluble form of Jagged-1 is responsible for the EC-mediated paracrine
or angiocrine activation of Notch signaling in neighboring cancer cells, we first used small
interfering RNA (siRNA) to knock down Jagged-1 expression in LPEC cells and decrease
secretion of soluble Jagged-1 in LPEC CM (Figure 5B). CM collected from Jagged-1
siRNA- or control (scrambled) siRNA-transfected LPECs were applied to HT29 cells for 72
hrs, and activation of Notch signaling pathway and the CSC phenotypes were then assessed.
Depletion of Jagged-1 in LPEC CM by siRNA blocked the EC CM mediated activation of
Notch signaling in HT29 cells, as demonstrated by the decreased expression of NICD and

Hes-1 compared with that in controls (Figure 5C). Furthermore, depletion of Jagged-1 in
LPEC CM also blocked its effect on promotion of the CSC phenotype in HT29 cells and
xhCRC cells, as demonstrated by blockade of sphere-forming ability (Figure 5D–E).
Similarly, depletion of Jagged-1 in RF24 CM by siRNA (Figure S4C) blocked the activation
of Notch signaling (Figure S4D) and blocked enrichment of the Aldefluor-positive cells and
sphere forming ability (Figures S4E–F).
We also used an immunoprecipitation-based approach to deplete Jagged-1 in EC CM to
determine whether Jagged-1 was responsible for promoting the CSC phenotype. Following
depletion of soluble Jagged-1 in EC CM by an antibody recognizing the N-terminus of
Jagged-1 (Figure S4G), the EC CM was no longer able to enrich for cells with sphereforming capability in xhCRC cells and HCT116 cells (Figures 5F and S4H). In a follow-up
study, we added a Jagged-1 neutralizing antibody directly to the LPEC CM, and it blocked
the enrichment of the sphere forming population of freshly isolated xhCRC cells (data not
shown).

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We obtained additional confirmation that the soluble form of Jagged-1 secreted by ECs is
indeed the major factor that activates Notch signaling and promotes the CSC phenotype in
neighboring CRC cells. First, we fractionated LPEC CM using size exclusion-fast protein
liquid chromatography, and determined the fractions for activity that induce Notch signaling
using a Hes-1 promoter driven luciferase reporter assay. As is shown in Figure 6A, we
identified a single bioactive peak within the combined fractions 32–34 that induced Notch
signaling. Simultaneously, we examined the presence of soluble Jagged-1 in the various
fractions by Western blotting, and found that the soluble Jagged-1 containing fractions
corresponded directly to the fractions (32–34) that activated the Hes-1 reporter (Figure 6A).
Second, we immunoprecipitated Jagged-1 from EC CM and ran the IP sample in a
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) gel. After staining with Coomassie blue, we
observed a single band representing Jagged-1 (data not shown). Next, we ran both native
and denatured LPEC CM protein samples on a non-denaturing PAGE gel, and blotted for
Jagged-1 by Western blotting. As shown in Figure S5A, the soluble form of Jagged-1
secreted by ECs is not stably associated with other proteins and is monomeric. These data
indicate that the soluble form of Jagged-1 that we identified is the Notch activating molecule
in EC CM.
The EC-secreted Soluble Form of Jagged-1 is a C-terminally Truncated Protein

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In CRC and EC cell lysates, intact Jagged-1 could be detected by both Jagged-1 N-terminusspecific and C-terminus-specific antibodies. However, soluble Jagged-1 in EC CM could
only be detected by the N-terminus-specific antibody (Figures 5A and S4A). After deglycosylation, the molecular weight of soluble Jagged-1 in CM was ~15–20 kD smaller than
that of full length Jagged-1 (Figure S5B). These results suggest that this soluble Jagged-1 is
a C-terminally truncated form.
In order to gain insights into whether this C-terminally truncated form of soluble Jagged-1 is
relevant in human CRCs, we co-stained human CRC specimens using an antibody against
either N-terminal or C-terminal Jagged-1; we simultaneously stained tissue sections with, an
antibody against the endothelial cell marker CD31. As shown in Figure S5C, staining with
the C-terminal Jagged-1 antibody, which only reacts with full length Jagged-1, largely
overlaps with CD31 staining. In contrast, the N-terminal Jagged-1 antibody, which
recognizes both full-length and soluble Jagged-1, not only co-stains CD31+ ECs, but also
strongly stains areas that are adjacent to ECs. These data support the existence of soluble
Jagged-1 in human CRCs.

We then sought to determine the nature of the soluble Jagged-1 protein enriched in the EC
CM. First, we sought to determine whether soluble Jagged-1 was a product of alternative
splicing. We performed semi-quantitative RT-PCR to detect Jagged-1 splicing variants in
CRC cells and ECs, and excluded this possibility as these two type of cells expressed equal
levels of the alternatively spliced Jagged-1 mRNA (Figure S5D). We then hypothesized that
a post-translational event leads to the generation of this soluble Jagged-1. When we
transfected full-length Jagged-1 cDNA into LPEC cells, an increase of soluble Jagged-1
secretion in its CM was observed (data not shown). Compared with the CM of mocktransfected LPECs, CM collected from LPECs with Jagged-1 over-expression could further
promote the CSC phenotype of HT29 cells, as demonstrated by a further enrichment of the
Aldefluor-positive cell population (data not shown). To further test this possibility, we
treated LPECs and RF24 cells with a protease inhibitor cocktail and found that broad
spectrum inhibition of protease activity resulted in reduction of the soluble Jagged-1
generation (Figure S5E), further suggesting that EC-secreted soluble Jagged-1 is a product
derived from protease cleavage of full-length Jagged-1. Taken together, these results suggest
that ECs are capable of post-translational modifications that lead to the production of this
soluble form of Jagged-1.
Proteomic Analysis of Soluble Jagged-1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In order to further define the structure of the soluble Jagged-1 protein, we employed a mass
spectrometry-based strategy. Briefly, we isolated the Jagged-1 proteins from LPEC CM via
immunoprecipitation using an N-terminal antibody and subjected them to deglycosylation
followed by digestion. Mass spectrometry identified multiple peptides consistent with the
Jagged-1 amino acid sequence (Figure 6B), confirming the identity of soluble Jagged-1
protein in the EC CM. In addition, we identified a peptide “KRDGNSSLIAAVAE” bearing
only one Lys-N site, indicating that the possible C-terminus of soluble Jagged-1 was at
amino acid 1054. The identical proposed C-terminal peptide was also found in protein
samples isolated by immunoprecipitation of N-terminal Jagged-1 from CM of a second
endothelial cell line, RF24, indicating that this EC-secreted soluble form of Jagged-1 might
be truncated at amino acid 1054 (Figure 6B).
ADAM17 Cleaves Jagged-1 on ECs to Produce the Soluble Form Jagged-1

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

A recent study reported that the protease ADAM17 could mediate Jagged-1 shedding (ParrSturgess et al., 2010); however, the investigators did not report on the specific cleavage site
or the function of this cleaved product. Interestingly, by analyzing the protein sequences
flanking E1054 of Jagged-1 (Figure 6B), we found that VAEV is a plausible recognition
motif for the protease ADAM17, which may cleave the protein between E1054 and V1055
(Caescu et al., 2009). Therefore, we hypothesized that ADAM17 is the protease that cleaves
Jagged-1 in ECs to generate the soluble form of the protein. To test our hypothesis, we first
synthesized a peptide consisting of aa1047–1061 (SLIAAVAEVRVQRRP) of Jagged-1 and
subjected it to ADAM17 cleavage followed by mass spectrometry analysis. After ADAM17
cleavage, a 906.56 Da peptide was identified and determined to be VRVQRRP (Figure 6C,
middle panel); this cleavage was inhibited by TAPI-2, an inhibitor of ADAM17 (Figure 6C,
right panel). These data confirm that ADAM17 specifically cleaves Jagged-1 between
residues E1054 and V1055. We next co-transfected full-length human Jagged-1 and
ADAM17 expression plasmids into a mouse fibroblast cell line, L cells. As shown in Figure
S6A, we found that the soluble form of Jagged-1 was enriched in the conditioned medium
(Here we used two different antibodies that recognize the N-terminus of Jagged-1, to rule
out any possibility of a none-specific signal with the use of a single antibody); this
conditioned medium could promote the CSC phenotype of freshly isolated hCRC cells, as
documented by CD133 FACS analysis (Figure S6B) and sphere forming ability (Figure
S6C). These data confirm that ADAM17 could cleave full-length Jagged-1, leading to

Inhibition of ADAM17 Blocks the Angiocrine Effect of ECs That Promotes the Colorectal
CSC Phenotype By Blocking Soluble Jagged-1 Production
We sought to investigate whether inhibition of ADAM17 could suppress the endothelial cell
mediated promotion of colorectal CSC phenotype by blocking Jagged-1 production. We
knocked down ADAM17 expression in LPECs by siRNA and found that this resulted in a
significant decrease in the production of soluble Jagged-1 in LPEC CM (Figure 7A). We
then used the ADAM17 inhibitor TAPI-2 to determine if inhibition of ADAM17 activity
would block production of soluble Jagged-1. Treatment of LPECs with TAPI-2 significantly
reduced soluble Jagged-1 production in its CM (Figure 7B). Importantly, TAPI-2 also
inhibited the angiocrine effect of LPECs that promotes the CSC phenotype of CRC cells, as
demonstrated by decreased enrichment of sphere forming populations in HT29 cells and
freshly isolated xhCRC cells (Figure 7C–D). These studies confirm that ADAM17 is
essential for soluble Jagged-1 production by ECs.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

Finally we performed an in vivo study using xenograft models to determine if inhibition of
ADAM17 can block the angiocrine promotion of tumorigenicity. We co-injected freshly
isolated xhCRC cells with LPECs subcutaneously into mice, and treated the animals with
daily TAPI-2 by intraperitoneal (IP) injection. We found that TAPI-2 treatment significantly
suppressed tumor initiation (Figure 7E). This data suggests that ADAM17 mediated
shedding of Jagged-1 from ECs is an important mechanism that mediates the angiocrine
effect on tumor initiation.
Taken together, our data suggest that ADAM17 is the protease that cleaves Jagged-1 in ECs,
and the resultant soluble Jagged-1 functions in a paracrine manner to activate Notch
signaling and promote the CSC phenotype of nearby CRC cells.

DISCUSSION

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

The concept of targeting the tumor vasculature as an antineoplastic strategy was developed
~40 years ago by Folkman (Folkman, 1971). However, therapeutic agents targeting classic
angiogenic mediators, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, have only minimally
improved progression-free and overall survival when added to chemotherapy regimens for
patients with metastatic CRC (Saltz et al., 2008). Although tumor vascularity correlates with
the aggressiveness of CRC, this does not necessarily imply an associated increase in blood
flow (Takahashi et al., 1995; Weidner et al., 1991)). It is possible that ECs play a more
active role in mediating tumor growth and metastasis than simply providing the physical
structure that forms conduits for blood flow. The development of more effective agents
targeting the vasculature may require approaches that go beyond targeting the classic
angiogenic pathways by current means.
Here, we provide several lines of evidence demonstrating that ECs secrete soluble factors
that promote the colorectal CSC phenotype via a paracrine effect: CM derived from ECs can
1) enrich the Aldefluor-positive CRC cell population, 2) enrich CRC cells expressing
putative colorectal CSC surface marker CD133, 3) increase CRC cell sphere-forming
capability, 4) enhance tumorigenicity, and 5) confers chemoresistance to CRC cells. We also
determined that the major EC-secreted factor is an un-reported form of Jagged-1 that
activates Notch signaling in neighboring CRC cells to confer the stem cell-like properties.
The identification (or existence) of CSCs remains a point of controversy. Numerous markers
have been used to identify CSCs from CRC specimens, including the cell surface marker

CD133, functional studies such as the Aldefluor assay and sphere-forming ability, and in
vivo studies such as the serial dilution based tumorigenicity assay. In our studies, we
assessed all of these markers, and all confirmed that ECs secrete a factor(s) that increase the
percentage of CRCs with CSC properties. We believe the tumorigenicity and
chemoresistance assays are the most important studies that potentially have clinical
implications.
Many studies suggest that CSCs originate from mutations in stem cells that cause malignant
transformation (Barker et al., 2009; Dick, 2008; Korkaya and Wicha; Passegue et al., 2003).
However, other investigators have noted that CSCs exist in a state of flux and that the CSC
population can be enriched by microenvironmental influences (Chaffer et al., 2011; Rosen
and Jordan, 2009; Vermeulen et al., 2010). In our studies, EC CM increased the percentage
of cells with CSC characteristics, further supporting the idea that the microenvironment can
regulate the CSC phenotype. Our findings that EC CM can convert a non-CSC to a cell with
CSC properties are in line with recent studies showing that CSCs and non-CSCs do not exist
in fixed states (Chaffer et al., 2011; Gupta et al, 2011). More importantly, we demonstrated
that Notch signaling activation by a soluble ligand is an important mechanism through
which the CSC population is enriched in CRC by the microenvironment.

The observation that CSCs accumulate in perivascular regions has been reported by several
groups (Butler et al., 2010a; Calabrese et al., 2007; Krishnamurthy et al., 2010). EC-secreted
factors have been shown to promote the self-renewal of CSCs in squamous cell carcinomas,
as demonstrated by up-regulated Bmi-1 expression and an increase in sphere formation in
vitro (Krishnamurthy et al., 2010). Others have shown that ECs could promote glioblastoma
stem-like cell expansion by secreting factors that activate mTOR signaling (Galan-Moya et
al., 2011). These studies support the notion that tumor-associated ECs play a direct role in
maintaining a population of CSCs. We demonstrated that ECs produce a truncated soluble
form of Jagged-1 that activates Notch signaling in CRC cells to promote their CSC
phenotype. We also showed that, in both primary and metastatic human CRC specimens,
NICD- and CD133-positive cells are primarily located in perivascular areas. Our findings
suggest that ECs play an important role in establishing a perivascular niche for colorectal
CSCs through inducing Notch signaling in tumor cells by releasing soluble Jagged-1 in a
paracrine manner.

Rafii and colleagues reported that EC expression of Jagged-1 and Jagged-2 could stimulate
the expansion of Notch-dependent hematopoietic stem cells (Butler et al., 2010b). Similarly,
Fan’s group reported that human brain microvascular ECs could activate Notch signaling in
adjacent glioblastoma cells in a juxtacrine manner (Zhu et al., 2011). Taketo and colleagues
also reported that tumor-associated ECs express Jagged-1 and Dll-4 that activate Notch
signaling on CRC cells (Sonoshita et al., 2011). In these studies, direct cell-cell contact
(juxtacrine signaling) was required for ECs to maintain hematopoietic/cancer stem cell
propagation (Butler et al., 2010b; Kobayashi et al., 2010). In our studies however, we
defined a previously unrecognized mechanism through which ECs activate Notch signaling
to promote CRC cell stemness, namely, production of a soluble paracrine/angiocrine Notch
ligand.
In this study we were able to determine the identity of the soluble form of Jagged-1 secreted
by ECs, produced through ADAM17 cleavage. In addition, we determined that this soluble
form of Jagged-1 activates Notch signaling and, in turn, mediates the CSC phenotype of
CRC cells. In the classic model of Notch signaling (Figure 8A), Notch is activated by cell
surface bound ligands, where cell-cell contact is required. We propose a Notch activation
model, as shown in Figure 8B, whereby the full-length Jagged-1 is cleaved by ADAM17,
which results in the production of a truncated soluble form of Jagged-1 that can activate

Notch signaling in nearby cells. This manner of Notch pathway activation does not require
cell-cell contact, and therefore, we refer to it as paracrine/angiocrine activation of Notch.

Several studies have reported contrasting biologic effects of soluble Notch ligands. Two
groups generated soluble mutants of Drosophila Notch ligands Delta and/or Serrate, and
found that these forms could function as antagonists of Notch signaling (Hukriede and
Fleming, 1997; Sun and Artavanis-Tsakonas, 1997). Similarly soluble forms of human
Jagged-1 and DLL-1 composed only of the extracellular domain were reported to inhibit
Notch signaling (Small et al., 2001; Trifonova et al., 2004). An engineered soluble Notch
ligand, DLL4-Fc, in which the extracellular domain of DLL4 was fused to a human IgG1 Fc
fragment, has been shown to inhibit Notch activation (Lobov et al., 2007; Noguera-Troise et
al., 2006). In contrast, several groups have shown that soluble Jagged1-derived peptides are
able to activate Notch signaling in several cell types, leading to keratinocyte differentiation
(Nickoloff et al., 2002), maturation of dendritic cells (Weijzen et al., 2002) apoptosis in B
cell leukemia cells (Kannan et al., 2011), and inhibited differentiation of hematopoietic
precursor cells (Li et al., 1998). Importantly, a naturally occurring soluble form of Jagged1
was found in human skin, inducing epithelial differentiation, a phenotype consistent with
Notch activation (Aho, 2004). We found a naturally occurring soluble Jagged-1 that can
activate Notch signaling in CRC cells. The reasons for the apparent discrepancies among
different studies are not well understood. A major determinant of whether a soluble ligand
activates or inhibits Notch signaling could be the specific structure of the ligand. Thus we
speculate that distinct forms of soluble Notch ligands, due to different species, cleavages,
post-translational modifications, and/or engineering strategies, may account for their
different biologic behaviors.
Although Notch inhibitors are being studied in clinical trials, toxicity has been noted
limiting clinical development. Our discovery of truncated soluble form of Jagged-1 that
activates Notch signaling in CRC cells has potential clinical implications. Neutralization of
Notch activation triggered by soluble Jagged-1 may be a more specific and refined approach
to sensitize tumors to anti-neoplastic therapies.
Although we believe that soluble Jagged-1 is the major factor that mediates the angiocrine
effect that promotes the colorectal CSC phenotype, we do not exclude the possibility that
other signaling events that may also contribute to induction of the CSC phenotype. Given
the obvious complexity of tumor microenvironment, we believe other important angiocrine
factors remain to be identified, and this will be important in the development and refinement
of new therapeutic approaches.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

In summary, our study defines a mechanism for the angiocrine function of ECs that leads to
Notch activation that, in turn, promotes the CSC phenotype. This study reports the
generation of an active, soluble form of Jagged-1 that is the product of ADAM17 protease
activity. Our findings, along with other studies in the field of angiocrine signaling, suggest
that ECs are more than simply conduits for nutrient and oxygen delivery - they also
contribute soluble factors to promote the CSC phenotype and chemoresistance. It is possible
that targeting angiocrine signaling, including soluble Jagged-1 and/or ADAM17, may
improve the outcomes of therapy for patients with metastatic CRC.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Isolation of Human CRC Cells and Liver Parenchyma ECs
Human CRC (hCRC) cells and LPECs were isolated from CRC or liver parenchyma tissue
from surgical specimens, respectively. Xenografted human CRC (hxCRC) cells were
isolated from mice after a direct inoculation with freshly isolated human CRC cells derived

from patients (See Supplemental Experimental Procedures). The MDACC Institutional
Review Board approved human specimen procurement, and the informed consent was
obtained.
Tumorigenicity Studies
All mice were housed in the MDACC animal facility, and all experiments were performed in
accordance with guidelines approved by the MDACC Institutional Animal Care & Use
Committee. LPEC CM pretreated xhCRC cells were injected subcutaneously into nude
mice. Primary xenografts were harvested, and treated with LPEC CM for 7 days before
secondary xenograft passaging (See Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Tumor growth
was monitored by a blinded investigator.
In Vivo Metastasis Studies
Luciferase labeled CRC cells were pre-treated with EC CM for 7 days, and injected
intravenously (Saltz et al.) via tail vein, or via the spleen (liver metastasis model). Luciferase
activity was used to assess the relative tumor burden (See Supplemental Experimental
Procedures).
Statistical Analysis

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

For all in vitro and ex vivo experiments, statistical analyses were conducted using Student’s
t test (Microsoft Excel). For in vivo studies, statistical analyses were performed using the
Kaplan Meier test (Software R) (tumorigenicity), Chi-square test (Microsoft Excel) (tumor
incidence), and Mann Whitney-U test (number of metastatic sites and tumor burden). All
statistical tests were two-sided, and p values ≤0.05 were considered to be significant.

SIGNIFICANCE

NIH-PA Author Manuscript

We found that endothelial cell (EC)-derived soluble factors enhance the cancer stem cell
(CSC) phenotype and chemoresistance of colorectal cancer cells (CRCs). This suggests
that ECs in the tumor microenvironment are more than simply conduits for blood flow they also actively secrete factors that promote tumor cell survival and growth. We further
defined a soluble, ADAM17-cleaved form of Jagged-1 in endothelial cell conditioned
medium that activates Notch signaling and promotes the CSC phenotype in CRC cells.
Identification of this mechanism, by which the tumor microenvironment can promote the
CSC phenotype, should provide the foundation for more refined targeted therapies for the
treatment of both early and late stage malignancies.

Figure 6. Proteomics Analysis Demonstrate that the EC-secreted Soluble Form of Jagged-1 is Cterminally Truncated by ADAM17

(A) Concentrated LPEC CM was fractionated by FPLC gel filtration. The fractions were
applied to xhCRC cells containing the Hes-1 promoter - luciferase construct, and Hes-1
promoter activity was assessed (upper panel). Western blot detection of soluble Jagged-1 in
combined adjacent fractions is shown in the lower panel.
(B) Jagged-1 from LPEC CM was immunoprecipitated using an N-terminal antibody and
subjected them to deglycosylation followed by digestion. Mass spectrometric analysis of
Jagged-1 proteins was performed with multiple peptides that identified consistent with the
N-terminal region of Jagged-1 with a C-terminus at amino acid 1054.

(C) Mass spectrometric analysis of the ADAM17 cleavage site of Jagged-1. A synthetic
peptide corresponding to aa1047–1061 of Jagged-1 was incubated with buffer only (left
panel). ADAM17 (middle panel), or ADAM17 with its inhibitor TAPI-2 (right panel), and
the reaction products were subjected to mass spectrometry. Peak 1 represents the intact
substrate SLIAAVAEVRVQRRP, and Peak 2 represents the ADAM17 cleavage product, a
906.56 Da peptide that was determined to be VRVQRRP.

Figure 8. Proposed Model for EC-mediated Paracrine Activation of Notch Signaling in
Colorectal Cancer Cells

(A) The conical model for Notch pathway activation, where membrane bound ligands such
as Jagged-1 activates Notch signaling in contacting cells.
(B) Schematic summarizing our proposed model for paracrine activation of the Notch
pathway in CRC cells. ADAM17 cleaves membrane bound Jagged-1 on ECs, releasing an
N-terminal soluble fragment that binds, and activates, Notch on CRC cells.
