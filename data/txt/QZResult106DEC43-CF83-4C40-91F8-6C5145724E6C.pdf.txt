Microtubule-Disrupting Chemotherapeutics Result in
Enhanced Proteasome-Mediated Degradation and
Disappearance of Tubulin in Neural Cells
Lyn M. Huff1, Dan L. Sackett2, Marianne S. Poruchynsky1, and Tito Fojo1

Abstract
We sought to examine the effects of microtubule-targeting agents (MTA) on neural cells to better understand the problem of neurotoxicity, their principal side effect, and to possibly develop a model of clinical
toxicity. Studies showed that microtubule-depolymerizing agents (MDA) not only disassembled microtubules
in neural HCN2 cells but also led to rapid disappearance of tubulin, and that this was specific for MDAs.
Tubulin levels decreased to 20% as early as 8 hours after adding vincristine, and to 1% to 30% (mean, 9.8 ±
7.6%; median of 7%) after 100 nmol/L vincristine for 24 hours. This disappearance was reversible. An increase
in both glu-terminated and acetylated tubulin, markers of stable tubulin, preceded reaccumulation of soluble
tubulin, suggesting a priority for stabilizing tubulin first as microtubules before replenishing the soluble pool.
Similar results were shown with other MDAs. Furthermore, microtubule reassembly did not arise from a central focus but instead appeared to involve dispersed nucleation, as evidenced by the appearance of small,
stable microtubule stubs throughout the cytoplasm. In contrast, experiments with four nonneural “normal”
cell lines and four cancer cell lines resulted in microtubule destabilization but only modest tubulin degradation. Evidence for proteasome-mediated degradation was obtained by demonstrating that adding a proteasome inhibitor before vincristine prevented tubulin disappearance. In summary, MDAs lead to rapid
disappearance of tubulin in neural but not in other normal or cancer cells. These results underscore the
fine control that occurs in neural cells and may further our understanding of neurotoxicity following MDAs.

Introduction
Microtubules are filamentous polymers that, along with
actin and intermediate filaments (vimentin, lamin, and keratin), comprise the cytoskeleton. Microtubules are composed
of α/β-tubulin heterodimers that form linear protofilaments
and then arrange in parallel to create cylindrical “tubules.”
The continuous equilibrium of microtubule assembly
(growth) and disassembly (shortening) make the microtubules dynamic structures that maintain cell shape, polarity,
and motility; provide a scaffold for cellular trafficking of proteins and organelles; and play an integral role in mitosis.

Because microtubules and their dynamics are required for
mitotic spindle formation and chromosome separation during mitosis, they are an important target for a chemically
diverse group of anticancer drugs that induce mitotic arrest
and cell death in vitro.
Microtubule-targeting agents (MTA) have been used clinically since the 1960s as single agents or in combinatorial
regimens for the effective treatment of leukemia, lymphoma,
and various solid tumors. MTAs inhibit cell proliferation
by disrupting the dynamics of microtubule polymerization
(1, 2). These mitotic inhibitors include the Vinca alkaloids
(vincristine, vinblastine, vinorelbine, vinflunine) that destabilize or depolymerize microtubules, and the taxanes
(paclitaxel, docetaxel) and epothilones (ixabepilone) that polymerize microtubules, thus causing mitotic arrest. Although
it is often stated that MTAs kill proliferating cancer cells by
causing mitotic arrest that in turn leads to apoptosis (3–6),
such a mechanism is unlikely to be important in patients
whose tumors divide on average every 30 to 60 days (7, 8).
Evidence that such agents can bring about cell death without
affecting mitotic arrest includes the primary toxicity of these
agents; that is, the neurotoxicity that inflicts damage on somatic nerve cells that rarely divide (9).
Although neurotoxicity is the principal toxic effect observed clinically with MTAs, how and why this happens is
not well understood (10), although it is thought to be due,

Drug-Induced Degradation of Tubulin in Neural Cells

at least in part, to the inhibition of axonal microtubules
that are necessary for axonal transport in neurons (11).
Other than the obvious explanation that neural cells have
large amounts of tubulin, studies addressing this phenomenon have been hampered by the lack of suitable in vitro or
animal models.
The starting point for this work was a motivation to further understand the effects of MTAs on neural cells to
(a) comprehend what role, if any, they might have in the phenomenon of chemo-brain (chemotherapy-associated cognitive dysfunction presumably due to penetration of the
blood-brain barrier by anticancer agents); (b) attempt to
better understand the problem of neurotoxicity, often a
treatment-limiting side effect of this class of drugs; and
(c) possibly develop a model of some relevance to neurotoxicity. In the conduct of these studies, we noticed that the
microtubule-destabilizing agents (MDA) not only led to the
dissolution of microtubules when administered to neural
cells but also to the rapid disappearance of tubulin—an observation we had never made in hundreds of similar experiments with cancer cell lines. Prior studies have described the
tight regulation of tubulin in neural cells (12, 13). This regulation is not surprising given that (a) tubulin makes up >20%
of the soluble protein in brain and (b) the precise polarity of
microtubule can differ in different regions of a single neuron,
and this polarity is essential for proper intracellular transport
and hence for synaptic function. We sought to further investigate our observation of tubulin degradation in neural cells
and compare the results with those obtained in cancer cells
treated under similar conditions. We describe herein the results of these experiments.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and reagents
HCN2 and HCN1A neural cells and CRL 2127 (skin fibroblasts) were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were grown in DMEM supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine, 100 units/mL
penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. MCF-10A (breast
epithelial) were grown in DMEM/F12 supplemented with
5% horse serum, 10 ng/mL epidermal growth factor,
500 ng/mL hydrocortisone, 10 μg/mL insulin, and penicillin
and streptomycin as described above. Human umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVEC) were obtained from Lonza and
grown in endothelial cell growth medium (EGM BulletKit,
Lonza). Cancer cell lines used include MCF-7 (breast), A549
(lung), SY5Y (neuroblastoma and obtained from ATCC), and
1A9 (ovarian, a A2780 subclone; ref. 14), and were grown in
RPMI and supplemented as described above. All cells obtained from cell repositories were grown in culture for less
than 6 months.
The following chemicals were used in this study: vincristine,
cycloheximide, doxorubicin, paclitaxel, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU),
3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol13-acetate, nerve growth factor, and bafilomycin A (Baf;
Sigma); ixabepilone (Bristol Myers Squibb); dolastatin and
MG132 (Calbiochem); and ammonium chloride (NH 4 Cl;

Fisher Scientific). Reagents were reconstituted and stored
according to the manufacturer's instructions.
MTT assays
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and treated with increasing concentrations of vincristine. Vincristine IC50 values
for each cell line described in Supplementary Table S1 were
determined using the CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Cell
Proliferation Assay (Promega) as per the manufacturer's protocol. Plates were read on a Bio-Rad Imager (Bio-Rad).
Immunoblots
Cells grown to 70% to 80% confluency in 12-well plates
were harvested after drug treatment in 100 μL/well of protein lysis buffer containing 1 mmol/L MgCl2 , 2 mmol/L
EGTA, 0.5% NP40, and 20 mmol/L Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) supplemented with protease inhibitors (protease inhibitor cocktail
tablets, Roche) plus 200 units/mL aprotinin (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 10 μmol/L trichostatin A (Cayman Chemical). Protein
concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Protein
Assay Reagent (BioRad), and 20 μg protein were loaded per
well onto 10% or 4% to 15% gradient SDS-PAGE gels. After
transfer onto nitrocellulose, blots were blocked in 0.5% milk
and each blot was probed with an anti-actin antibody (C4
monoclonal, Chemicon) as an internal control. Other
primary antibodies used were anti-p53 (Ab-6 monoclonal
Do1, Oncogene Science), anti-acetylated tubulin (clone 611B-1, Sigma), and anti–α-tubulin (DM1A monoclonal,
Sigma). Infrared species-specific secondary antibodies
(LiCor) were used, and protein expression was quantitated
using the Odyssey Infrared Imager (LiCor).
Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR
HCN2 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L vincristine for
0, 8, 24, or 24 hours, followed by 24 hours incubation in a
drug-free medium. RNA was isolated from HCN2 cells at
these time points using the Qiagen RNeasy method (Qiagen).
One microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed. Real-time
PCR was performed on cDNA template using Taqman
Master UPL kit (Roche) and the following primers:
α-Tub 5′: CCTTCGCCTCCTAATCCCTA
α-Tub 3′: AGCAGGCATTGCCAATCT
28s 5′: AAACTCGGTGGAGGTCCGT
28s 3′: CTTACCAAAAGTGGCCCACTA.
Tubulin levels were normalized to 28S RNA and compared
with untreated HCN2 control RNA.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Cells plated on glass coverslips in 24-well dishes were incubated either with or without vincristine for 24 hours, rinsed in
PBS twice, and either fixed immediately in 100% methanol at
−20°C for 10 minutes (15) or incubated in medium without
drug for washout (periods of 20 minutes, or 1, 4, 8, or 24
hours) before fixation. Following fixation, all coverslips were
rinsed in PBS and incubated for 45 minutes in 20% goat serum
in PBS, followed by incubation in either mouse monoclonal

anti–α-tubulin (DM1A) or mouse anti–acetylated α-tubulin
(Sigma), and rabbit anti pericentrin (Abcam). Following
rinses in PBS after each primary antibody incubation, the
coverslips were incubated in either fluorescein-conjugated goat
anti-mouse IgG or rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit
secondary IgG (both from Jackson Immuno Research Labs,
Inc.). 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) was used to counterstain nuclei. Antibody control cells were incubated without
any primary or secondary antibodies, with only nonspecific primary IgG, or with only secondary antibodies. Stained cells were
visualized on a Zeiss Axiovert 100M microscope equipped with
a Plan-NeoFluar 100×/1.3 oil immersion objective, and confocal
images were generated using a Zeiss LSM510 META. Images in

Results
In an attempt to better understand how MTAs affect neural cells, we began exploratory studies using a neural cell line
(HCN2) established from normal neural cells derived from
the cerebral cortical tissue of a patient with Rasmussen's encephalitis (16). Although we recognize the limitations of such
in vitro studies, we felt that given the lack of suitable models,
these cells at a minimum presented us a starting point.
Figure 1 shows results from one of the initial experiments
performed to assess the response of the neural cell line HCN2
to several chemotherapeutic agents. An increase in p53 levels
was seen in response to the DNA-damaging agent doxorubicin (400 ng/mL) when HCN2 cells were treated for 24 hours,
an observation that was expected in these cells with wildtype p53. Consistent with our experience in other models,
treatment with paclitaxel (50 nmol/L) or ixabepilone
(50 nmol/L) for 24 hours stabilized microtubules, as shown
by increased levels of the acetylated form of α-tubulin (acetyl
tubulin), a marker of stable microtubules (similar results
were observed with an antibody that detects the detyrosinated form of α-tubulin; not shown). We note here that
the relative increases observed in these cells that under normal circumstances have a very stable microtubule network

is not as pronounced as seen with cancer cell lines. As
expected, overnight treatment of HCN2 cells with vincristine
destabilized microtubules and lowered acetyl tubulin levels
(and detyrosinated tubulin; not shown). Surprisingly, however, overnight treatment with vincristine (25, 50, or
100 nmol/L) also resulted to a marked reduction of tubulin
levels as measured with several α-tubulin antibodies. The
DNA-damaging agent, 5-FU (5 mmol/L) had no effect on
tubulin levels or stability.
Although we anticipated that treatment with vincristine
would destabilize microtubules, the decrease in total tubulin
levels was unexpected and not previously noted in our work
with numerous cancer cell lines. Figure 2A shows a representative immunoblot of HCN2 cells treated with 100 nmol/L
vincristine (IC50 ≈11 μmol/L) from 8 to 48 hours. Tubulin
levels decreased to 30% of their starting levels as early as
8 hours after the addition of vincristine to the culture medium, a decrease that was detectable after 4 hours in other
experiments. A further decrease in tubulin levels occurred
by 24 hours, and tubulin was undetectable by 48 hours.
As the figure shows, vincristine-induced tubulin degradation
was reversible. An increase in acetylated tubulin, a marker
of stable microtubules, preceded the increase in total tubulin, suggesting a priority for incorporating any remaining
tubulin as well as newly synthesized tubulin into stable
microtubules, followed subsequently by a replenishment of
the soluble tubulin pool. This is seen when vincristine was
removed from the medium after 8 or 24 hours of drug treatment. In fact, the results of a separate experiment shown in
the graph in Fig. 2A shows that acetyl tubulin levels increased as early as 4 hours after the removal of vincristine
from the culture medium. We emphasize at this point that
the marked reductions in tubulin levels observed in these
experiments were detected with four different antibodies,
making it unlikely these results could be explained by the
loss or masking of an epitope rather than an actual reduction in tubulin levels. Although tubulin levels varied slightly,
in 18 successive experiments, total tubulin levels were reduced to an average of 9.8 ± 7.6% that of the starting level
(median of 7%) after treating HCN2 cells with 100 nmol/L
vincristine for 24 hours.

treated for 24 h with paclitaxel (PTX, 50 nmol/L),
ixabepilone (50 nmol/L), vincristine (VCR, 25,
50, and 100 nmol/L), doxorubicin (DOX,
400 ng/mL), and 5-FU (5 mmol/L). Immunoblots
were hybridized with anti-tubulin (total α-tubulin
and acetylated α-tubulin) and anti-p53
antibodies. Actin was used as a loading control.

Drug-Induced Degradation of Tubulin in Neural Cells

[(−) 24 h] from the culture medium following 8 h [+8 h (−) 24 h, +8 h (−) 24 h, and +8 h (−) 72 h] and 24 h [+24 h (−) 24 h, +48 h (−) 48 h] of vincristine treatment.
A graph of tubulin levels constructed from a separate experiment shows the reappearance of acetyl tubulin, a marker of stable microtubules, as early as
4 h following withdrawal of drug after 24 h of vincristine treatment. Tubulin levels were normalized to actin and compared with untreated HCN2 cells.
B, immunoblot of HCN2 probed with tubulin and actin antibodies after treatment with 1 nmol/L dolastatin for 24 h followed by removal of drug for the
time points indicated. Results are shown in the graph. C, immunoblot showing tubulin expression in HCN1a cells treated with 100 nmol/L vincristine for
8 and 24 h and following drug removal for 8 h [+24 (−8)] and 24 h [+24 (−24)]. D, tubulin RNA expression in untreated HCN2 cells compared with cells
treated with 100 nmol/L vincristine for 8 and 24 h and following drug removal after 24 h vincristine treatment [(+) 24 h (−) 24 h]. Experiments were done in
triplicate to obtain error bars.

That the effect seen with vincristine was not drug specific
but rather a consequence of microtubule destabilization was
confirmed by demonstrating similar results with the MDA dolastatin. To ensure that the tubulin recovery seen when vincristine was withdrawn from the culture medium was not

due to a washout effect of vincristine, dolastatin, a drug that
has sustained intracellular retention due to its high affinity for
tubulin, was chosen, and these results are shown in Fig. 2B.

(IC50 ≈ 0.5 nmol/L), and the effect on total and acetyl tubulin

was assessed at various time points after drug removal. A representative immunoblot shown in Fig. 2B shows the near-total
disappearance of total tubulin after 24 hours of dolastatin
treatment (0 hour off drug). Similar to the results observed
after treatment with vincristine, tubulin loss was reversible,
and again the increase in acetylated tubulin occurred
sooner than the increase in total tubulin, consistent with
a preferential incorporation of newly synthesized tubulin into
stabilized microtubules. However, the results shown in Fig. 2B
show an increase that far exceeded the starting level, an
observation that became clear when the cells were examined
by immunofluorescence (see below). Although dolastatin
uptake is considered irreversible, the time course of the recovery was similar to that following vincristine treatment and
was consistent with the synthesis of new tubulin, which in
the absence of free dolastatin was then preferentially incorporated into microtubules. We also observed similar results
with combretastatin, another depolymerizing agent that
binds not the Vinca but the colchicine site of tubulin—
establishing not drug binding but microtubule depolymerization as the essential event in tubulin degradation (data
not shown). In addition, we observed the destabilization
of microtubules and the disappearance of total tubulin with
vincristine treatment in HCN1a cells, a second neural cell
line (ref. 16; Fig. 2C). Like in the HCN2 cells, acetylated tubulin and total α-tubulin levels were reconstituted after
drug removal in HCN1 cells. Finally, we examined tubulin
gene expression in HCN2 cells in the presence and absence

of vincristine. The graph in Fig. 2D shows that tubulin RNA
levels normalized to the control gene 28S. RNA levels only decreased to 52% at 8 hours and to 39% by 24 hours with vincristine treatment, indicating that factors other than reduced
transcription were responsible for the marked decrease in tubulin protein levels to less than 10% of control (Fig. 2A). As
expected, mRNA levels then increased when drug is removed,
likely as a result of reduced tubulin protein levels and the absence of a repressive feedback effect on transcription (17).
Although HCN2 cells were isolated from human cerebral
cortex, to confirm that they had maintained their neural
properties in culture, we differentiated them as previously described (16) and observed neurite extensions within 4 hours of
drug exposure (data not shown). Supplementary Fig. S1A–B
shows phase microscopy of neurite production and increased
syaptophysin levels, respectively, in HCN2 cells after differentiation for 48 hours. However, total tubulin levels were still
markedly decreased after 8 and 24 hours treatment with
100 nmol/L vincristine (Supplementary Fig. S1C).
To establish that the extent of tubulin degradation seen in
HCN2 cells exceeded that in other “normal” cells, we compared the results in HCN2 cells with additional normal cell
lines as shown in Fig. 3. Relative to HCN2 cells (panel A),
when 100 nmol/L vincristine was added to MCF10A (breast),
CRL2127 (fibroblast), and HUVEC (umbilical endothelium)
cells (panels B–D), only minimal α-tubulin degradation occurred despite clear evidence of microtubule destabilization
as shown by the marked decrease in acetylated tubulin.

Figure 3. Compared with HCN2 cells, a decrease in total α-tubulin levels in normal cells was less pronounced despite microtubule destabilization.

Drug-Induced Degradation of Tubulin in Neural Cells

Figure 4. Vincristine treatment decreased tubulin levels in cancer cell
lines but not to the levels seen in neural cells. A, cancer cells (A549,
MCF-7, SY5Y, and 1A9) were treated with IC50 concentrations of
vincristine (Supplementary Table S1) for 8, 24, and 48 h compared with
100 nmol/L vincristine treatment in HCN2 cells. Total α-tubulin levels
in cancer cells compared with HCN2 cells are shown. B, total α-tubulin
levels in cancer cells are plotted and compared with HCN2 cells when
treated for 8 h with 100 nmol/L vincristine.

Microtubule destabilization was reversible in the absence of
vincristine in the nonneural normal cell lines, although recovery occurred at a later time point (24–48 hours) than in
the neural cells (8 hours).
We considered the effect on the HCN2 cells unique, having
never observed such results when working with numerous
cancer cell lines in the laboratory. However, to exclude the
possibility that we had missed such an effect, we performed
similar experiments with cancer cell lines representing four
different tissues of origin: A549 non–small cell lung cancer
cells, A2780 (1A9) ovarian carcinoma cells (14), MCF7 breast
cancer cells, and SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. As shown in
Supplementary Table S1, in a 4-day cytotoxicity experiment,
the IC50 for HCN2 neural cells was found to be 11 μmol/L—
far in excess of the 100 nmol/L maximum used in these
experiments—whereas that of the cancer cell lines was 1.6
to 40 nmol/L. When the stability of tubulin was examined
using vincristine concentrations equal to the IC50 values,
large differences were noted between the extent of tubulin
disappearance in the cancer cell lines compared with
HCN2 cells (Fig. 4A). Degradation was observed in the cancer
cell lines only at higher concentrations that exceeded the
IC50; however, at these concentrations, this was accompanied
by cell death and the associated protein degradation. A comparison at 100 nmol/L vincristine was only possible at 8 hours
before the onset of widespread cell death, and as shown in

www.aacrjournals.org

the graph, demonstrated preferential degradation in HCN2
neural cells (Fig. 4B).
Because in HCN2 cells tubulin degradation occurred in
the absence of cytotoxicity and was reversible, we assumed
that new protein synthesis must have occurred. Support for
this assertion is found in Fig. 5. As seen in Fig. 5A, even after
48-hour inhibition of protein synthesis with cycloheximide
(10 μg/mL), very little turnover of tubulin had occurred. This
underscores active tubulin degradation as the process behind
the decrease in tubulin levels following exposure to a MDA.
In addition, following vincristine withdrawal in the presence
of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, total tubulin
levels did not recover, but a recovery of “stable” tubulin
levels occurred, as seen by the increase in acetylated tubulin
shown in Fig. 6B, demonstrating stabilization of the remaining tubulin.
Degradation through the lysosomal or proteasomal pathways seemed logical starting points as possible mechanisms
of active tubulin degradation. To that end, we sought to determine the extent to which inhibition of these pathways
would affect the disappearance of tubulin. We investigated
the lysosomal pathway by pretreating HCN2 cells with the
lysosome inhibitors bafilomycin (10 nmol/L) and ammonium
chloride (10 mmol/L) for 24 hours followed by 100 nmol/L
vincristine for 24 hours in the presence of the inhibitors.
The results in Fig. 5C show that the inhibitors did not prevent the vincristine-induced α-tubulin degradation. We concluded that degradation through the lysosome was not a
major contributor to the rapid disappearance of α-tubulin.
However, pretreatment of cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG 132 (50 μmol/L) for 2 hours before the addition of
100 nmol/L vincristine, as shown in Fig. 5D, prevented the
disappearance of tubulin at 8 hours (MG 132 + vincristine),
and to a lesser extent after 24 hours when compared with
8 or 24 hours vincristine alone. Although this is consistent
with proteasome-mediated degradation of tubulin, we cannot conclude that proteasome degradation is the only mechanism for the MG132 effect because, as we have shown
previously, and confirm here, inhibition of the proteasome
stabilizes microtubules (18). This is shown clearly by the increase in stabilized (acetylated) tubulin seen with the addition of the proteasome inhibitor alone. However, this also
shows that vincristine alone works in the presence of
MG132. Because of this, one cannot exclude the possibility
that, to some extent, the stabilization that occurs as a result
of proteasome inhibition is in part mediated by the stabilization effect preventing tubulin degradation. That the protection seen after 24 hours is not as marked as that seen at
8 hours in part reflects cellular toxicity. Nonetheless, the
loss of acetylated tubulin when cells were treated with
vincristine + MG132 indicates that the microtubules still depolymerized but the tubulin was not degraded, consistent
with MG132 inhibition of the proteosome.
The immunoblots indicated that during the initial recovery of HCN2 cells from MDA exposure, most tubulin was incorporated into stable microtubules; however, we often saw
what seemed to be an excessive amount of compensation,
resulting in acetylated tubulin levels being higher than

drug-free controls. Thus, we sought to investigate this further
by performing immunofluorescence experiments on HCN2
cells using acetylated tubulin (Fig. 6A–E) and total α-tubulin
antibodies (Figs. 6F–J) in the presence or absence of
100 nmol/L vincristine. In Fig. 6A and F, untreated HCN2
cells displayed long microtubules that extend throughout
the cell and disappeared after a 24-hour treatment with vincristine (Fig. 6B and G). Four hours after the drug is removed,
short irregular microtubules appeared throughout the cell
(Fig. 6C, C inset, and H). In untreated control cells, the
microtubules were not organized in a radial array with a defined centrosomal focus. Following drug exposure, most tubulin staining was lost, although a few short Ac tubulin (+)
stubs were seen (Fig. 6B). During recovery from drug, multiple short, Ac tubulin (+) microtubules formed throughout the
cell. Microtubule formation did not arise from the centrosome because pericentrin staining showed two centrioles in

the majority of cells (Supplementary Fig. S2). Eight hours after drug removal (Fig. 6D, I, and I inset), microtubules were
found near the periphery of the cell, and by 24 hours (Fig. 6E
and J) these short microtubules were replaced by a microtubule network that can be considered more normal in appearance. Thus, for a time of recovery after drug exposure, only
short microtubules comprised the microtubule network.

Discussion
First introduced into clinical oncology in the 1960s, MTAs
are essential components in the therapy of many cancers,
including lymphoma as well as breast, ovarian, lung, and
head and neck cancers (19). In cancer cells, the focus has
often been on their ability to interfere with mitosis, a thesis
developed with rapidly proliferating in vitro models that has
never been proven in patients (20). However, because

Figure 5. Decreased tubulin levels in HCN2 cells after vincristine treatment is not due to increased protein degradation of soluble tubulin when protein
synthesis is inhibited but is partially mediated through the proteosome. A, HCN2 cells were treated with 100 nmol/L vincristine, 10 μg/mL cycloheximide, or
in combination [100 nmol/L vincristine + 10 μg/mL cycloheximide (CHX)] for 8, 24, and 48 h. B, immunoblot of HCN2 cells treated with 100 nmol/L
vincristine, 10 μg/mL cycloheximide, or in combination for 24 h after which vincristine was withdrawn [(−) 4 h, (−) 8 h, (−) 24 h, (−) 48 h, (−) 72 h], but 10 μg/mL
cycloheximide was maintained in the medium. Blots were hybridized with α-tubulin, acetyl-α-tubulin, and actin antibodies. Results are graphed.
C, immunoblot of HCN2 cells pretreated with lysosome inhibitors—10 nmol/L Baf and 10 mmol/L NH4Cl—for 24 h followed by the addition of 100 nmol/L
vincristine for 24 h in the presence of the inhibitor compared with 48 h of lysosome inhibitors alone, untreated HCN2 cells, and HCN2 cells treated for
24 h with 100 nmol/L vincristine. D, immunoblot of HCN2 cells treated with either 100 nmol/L vincristine alone, MG 132 (50 μmol/L) alone, or in combination
(vincristine + MG132) for 8 or 24 h. A 2-h pretreatment with MG132 preceded the drug treatment in combination (vincristine + MG132). Results are graphed.

Drug-Induced Degradation of Tubulin in Neural Cells

somatic neurons do not divide, a different explanation must
be considered to explain the most common side effect, neurotoxicity (21). The latter has largely centered on the likelihood that microtubule trafficking—especially crucial in
neurons—is adversely affected. Clinical support for this thesis
includes the fact that neuropathy usually begins in the hands
and feet, consistent with a greater impact on longer neurons
that are more likely to be affected by interference with trafficking (10). In the present study, we show that compared
with cancer cells, neurons respond differently to microtubule
disruption by rapidly degrading tubulin. Although we speculate on the importance this might have in terms of neurotoxicity, the results more directly highlight the delicate balance
that exists in neurons with regard to handling tubulin.
Our observations are consistent with previous reports
documenting precise regulation of tubulin metabolism in
neural cells (13). In this regard, we note that consistent with
the importance of microtubules in neural cells, the results
show the priority given to assembling stable microtubules
as recovery occurred, indicated by the increased acetylated

tubulin staining, followed later by an increase in soluble tubulin. However, whereas previous reports highlighted centrosomal nucleation and release (22), we found that microtubule
reassembly appeared to involve a mechanism of dispersed
nucleation, as small, stable microtubule stubs appeared
throughout the cytoplasm and not from a central focus. It
should be noted that the microtubule arrays in the control
HCN2 cells do not radiate from a clear center. Indeed, staining for pericentrin shows that the microtubule arrays are not
organized around the centrosomes. Therefore, the apparently
dispersed nucleation observed in drug washout is not surprising. Noncentrosomal microtubule arrays have been reported in a number of differentiated mammalian cell types
(23). A number of different mechanisms have been reported
for generation of these noncentrosomal microtubules, including nucleation and release from the centrosome as well
as dispersed nucleation from membrane sites or microtubule
oligomers. It has also been suggested that spontaneous dispersed nucleation can occur in cells in which the tubulin has
all been depolymerized, resulting in a high concentration of

tubulin dimers. This is clearly not the case here because depolymerized tubulin was degraded, resulting in a low level of
total cellular tubulin. Hence, recovery from drug exposure
starts with a low, not a high, concentration of dimeric tubulin.
Cellular control of the expression level of tubulin has been
studied for many years; however, most research has been directed at transcriptional and especially translational control
of synthesis, in particular autoregulation of tubulin mRNA
stability by the level of unpolymerized dimers. Much less is
known about regulation of the degradation of this very stable
protein, whose half-life can exceed the doubling time of the
cells in which it occurs (control of tubulin expression is reviewed in ref. 24). Some reports have addressed the degradation pathways of tubulin and documented that degradation
can be enhanced by drugs, including traditional antimicrotubule agents in normal cells (25), isothiocyanates in some
cancer cell lines (26, 27), and by peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor γ inhibitors (28, 29). Our study is the first
report documenting this effect in neural cells, demonstrating
that traditional MDAs that are in clinical use can produce
significant and rapid loss of tubulin.
Although we cannot say with certainty that these results
have clinical relevance, there is reason to suspect that they
may. The concentrations used in the experiments with
HCN2 cells (e.g., 100 nmol/L) are concentrations that can
be achieved in patients receiving MTAs (30, 31). Moreover,
although these concentrations are maintained transiently,
and clinically one would expect a recovery of tubulin levels
and microtubule stabilization as we observed in our in vitro
models, it is not unreasonable to assume that recurrent
events of microtubule depolymerization and tubulin degradation might take its toll and lead to a worsening of neurotoxicity over time (32). It is also not unreasonable to think
that this might explain the often-noted observation of transient neurotoxicity in which symptoms occur after drug
administration, but last only a few days and are followed

by recovery (33). Previous reports have shown the neurotoxic
effect of epothilone B on dorsal root ganglia and sciatic
nerves in Wistar and Fischer rats, citing both neurophysical
and neuropathologic changes. In addition, increased polymerized tubulin levels were observed in sciatic nerve lysates
after treatment with epothilone B compared with untreated
control animals (34). This suggests that examination of the
effects of MDAs in an animal model may be possible. Future
studies will be directed toward the in vivo effects of vincristine in murine models to look for tubulin degradation following drug treatment and the in vitro effects of vincristine
exposure in differentiated human neural stem cells to support the model of neurotoxicity proposed herein.
In summary, we report rapid degradation of tubulin in
normal neural cells following the administration of a MDA.
Tubulin levels were markedly reduced by 24 hours following
drug treatment and by 48 hours had resulted in the nearcomplete disappearance of tubulin. Tubulin degradation
was also rapidly reversible when the MDA was withdrawn.
This rapid degradation and recovery appears to be a property
that is much more developed in normal neural cells. The latter is not unexpected given that, in neural cells, this protein
is not only abundant but also crucial in neural trafficking.
