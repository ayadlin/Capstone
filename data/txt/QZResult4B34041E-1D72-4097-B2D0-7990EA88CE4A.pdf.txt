Abstract
A variety of human malignancies, including breast cancer, are
thought to be organized in a hierarchy, whereby a relatively
minor population of tumor initiating cells (TIC) is responsible
for tumor growth and the vast majority of remaining cells is
nontumorigenic. Analysis of TICs in model systems of breast
cancer would offer uniform and accessible source of tumor
cells and the power of mouse genetics to dissect these rare
cells. The HER2/Neu proto-oncogene is overexpressed in an
aggressive form of human breast cancer. Mouse mammary
tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu transgenic mice develop mammary
tumors that mimic human HER2 subtype breast cancer. Here,
we report on the functional identification of mouse HER2/Neu
TICs that can induce tumors after transplantation into the
mammary gland of recipient mice. Secondary tumors formed
after injecting MMTV-Neu TICs resemble primary tumors in
the original transgenic mice and are organized in a hierarchy
containing TICs as well as their nontumorigenic descendants.
To study MMTV-Neu TICs in vitro, we grew tumorspheres
under nonadherent culture conditions. Tumorsphere forming
units (TFU) capable of producing tumorspheres retained
tumorigenic potential and were indistinguishable by several
criteria from TICs. Interestingly, MMTV-Neu TICs and TFUs
were committed to the luminal cell fate when induced to
differentiate in vitro. Our data define reproducible characteristics of the MMTV-Neu TIC and TFU, which help to explain
marker expression profiles of HER2-positive breast cancer.
In addition, the similarity between TICs and TFUs in this
system provides a rationale for TFU-based screens to target
tumor-initiating cells in HER2+ breast cancer. [Cancer Res 2007;
67(18):8671–81]

Introduction
HER2/ErbB2/Neu, a transmembrane tyrosine kinase receptor of
the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor family, is overexpressed in 25% to 30% of human breast cancer (1). HER2-positive
breast tumors are particularly aggressive (2). The causative role of
HER2 and its overexpression in both tumors and metastatic sites
renders this oncoprotein an ideal therapeutic target. Indeed,
trastuzumab (Herceptin) a humanized monoclonal antibody
against the extracellular portion of HER2, has been reported to
improve overall response (3). In particular, the addition of
trastuzumab to the adjuvant therapy of HER2+ early breast cancer

has resulted in a 50% reduction in the risk of recurrence (4). Yet,
for patients with HER2+ metastatic cancer treated with optimal
combination therapy of chemotherapeutic drugs plus Herceptin,
the median progression-free survival is less than a year (5). Novel
approaches to target this aggressive form of breast cancer are
urgently needed.
There is growing evidence that the majority of cancer cells is
nontumorigenic. Tumor initiating cells (TIC), capable of forming
new tumors when transplanted into immunocompromised recipient mice and presumably primary tumors/metastatic disease in
cancer patients, are relatively rare (6–8). TICs were initially
identified in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in which cells capable
of inducing human AML in nonobese diabetic/severe combined
immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice were shown to possess differentiative and proliferative capacities, and the potential for selfrenewal characteristic of a leukemic stem cell (9, 10). Although the
AML TIC resembles and probably originates from the transformation of a stem cell, it is possible that other TICs originate from
transformation of early or late progenitor cells. Indeed, in mixed
lineage leukemia (MLL), oncogenic transformation can occur
within progenitor rather than stem cells, in part by inducing selfrenewal genes (11). Thus, the definition of a TIC is not related to
the cell of origin for a tumor but rather to its ability to self-renew,
initiate cancer, and give rise to more differentiated cells that have
lost self-renewal and tumorigenic potential.
The notion that cancer is driven by TICs has obvious therapeutic
implications (12). The efficacy of tumor response to systemic
therapy has traditionally been assessed on the bulk of tumor cells
by monitoring for changes in tumor size (13). However, if only a
small fraction of TICs is capable of initiating cancer, then curative
therapy should be designed to target these rare TICs rather than
the bulk of nontumorigenic cells. Thus, analysis of TICs may
unravel novel therapeutic approaches/targets.
Analysis of human breast cancer revealed that TICs in this
disease also represent a small fraction within an heterogeneous
population of mostly nontumorigenic cells (ref. 14; reviewed in
refs. 7, 15–19). Human breast TICs express early epithelial markers
such as epithelial specific antigen (ESA) and the cell surface marker
CD44, whereas nontumorigenic cells express CD24 (14). ESA+/
CD24low or CD44+/CD24low but not CD24high cells sorted from
pleural effusions induced tumors when injected into the fat pad of
NOD/SCID mice (14). The CD44+/CD24 tumor cells gave rise to
a heterogeneous tumor population that was again composed of
CD44+/CD24 TICs as well as their nontumorigenic CD24+
descendants. TICs have subsequently been identified in brain,
colon, ovarian, prostate and pancreatic tumors (20–24).
In mice, mammary stem cells (MSC) capable of repopulating
an empty fat pad and generating luminal-epithelial, myoepithelial,
and alveolar-epithelial cells have been functionally identified.
They were initially observed as stem cell antigen (Sca1)–positive
cells (25). Interestingly, the Sca1+ population is expanded in

MMTV-Wnt1 tumors but reduced in MMTV-Neu mammary tumors
(26–28). MSCs were subsequently identified as positive for the heatlabile CD24 antigen and either h1-integrin (CD29) or a6-integrin
(CD49f; ref. 29). CD29hi:CD24+ cells express the myoepithelial
marker K14, but not the luminal-epithelial marker K18, highlighting the basal nature of these stem cells. The CD29hi:CD24+
stem cell population is expanded in preneoplastic mammary
glands of MMTV-Wnt1 but not MMTV-Neu mice (29, 30). However, the relationship between MSCs and TICs in mouse models
using cell surface markers and functional analysis has not been
addressed.
Here, we report on identification of TICs from MMTV-Neu
mammary tumors. We show that tumorsphere-forming units (TFU)
and TICs both segregate with the same cell surface marker profile
and that tumorspheres contain TICs, suggesting that they originate
from the same cell. Our identification of MMTV-Neu TFUs and
TICs should facilitate analysis of these rare cells, the pathways
controlling their biology, as well as the screening and identification
of TIC-specific therapeutic targets.

Materials and Methods
Mice and PCR-based genotyping. MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Neu mice
both on pure FvB background were maintained in accordance with the
Canadian Animal Care Council. Primers for PCR-based genotyping of tail
DNA were as follows: Wnt1-forward 5¶-GGACTTGCTTCTCTTCTCATAGCC;
reversed 5¶-CCACACAGGCATAGAGTGTCTGC. Neu-forward 5¶-CTAGGCCACAGAATTGAAAGATCT; reversed 5¶-GTAGGTGGAAATTCTAGCATCATCC.
Tissue harvesting, single-cell preparation, and enrichment of Lin
epithelial cells. Mammary tumors (0.5–1.0 cm in diameter) or glands were
dissected from MMTV-Neu, MMTV-Wnt1 mice, and their wild-type
littermates. A portion of the tumor/tissue was fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
in PBS at 4jC overnight and sequentially dehydrated (30 min each in PBS,
saline, 50% ethanol/saline, 70% ethanol/saline) and paraffin embedded. The
remainder of the tumor (or gland) was minced into paste with sterile razor
blades, washed in PBS, and digested in 100 units/mL collagenase (Sigma)
for 2 h at 37jC with occasional mixing. The samples were washed with
5 volumes of HBSS (Sigma, phenol red free) + 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS)
and 2 mmol/L EDTA (HFE) and centrifuged at 450  g for 5 min. The pellet
was dissociated in 2 mL dispase (Life Technologies) for 3 min by continuous
pippetting, diluted with 10 mL HFE, and passed through a 40 Am cell
strainer (BD Falcon) to obtain single-cell suspension. Enrichment of
Lin epithelial cells was achieved through selective depletion of hematopoietic, endothelial, and stromal cells using an EasySep kit (StemCell
Technologies). Briefly, the single-cell suspension was concentrated to
1  108 cells/mL and FcR blocker (10 AL per mL) provided in the kit was
added to prevent nonspecific interactions. Biotinylated antibodies (0.5 Ag
per million cells) against stromal cells (anti-CD140a, eBiosciences),
endothelial cells (anti-CD31, BD PharMingen), and hematopoietic cells
(anti-CD45 and anti-TER119, StemCell Technologies) were added for 15 min
at room temperature. Antibody conjugation to magnetic nanoparticles
was achieved through 15-min incubation with EasySep Biotin Selection
cocktail followed by 10 min with EasySep Magnetic Nanoparticles. An
EasySep Magnetic device was used for 5 min to separate the Lin+ cells that
attached to the tube surface from the Lin epithelial cells that remained in
the supernatant.
Flow cytometry analysis and sorting. Fluorescence-activated cell
sorting (FACS) analysis was done using FACSCalibur flow cytometer
(Becton Dickinson) and the following antibodies: anti-CD49f conjugated
with R-phycoerythrin (CD49f-PE, 20 AL/million cells, BD PharMingen), antiCD24 conjugated with FITC (CD24-FITC, 1 Ag/million cells, BD PharMingen), and anti-Sca1 conjugated with R-phycoerythrin (Sca1-PE, 1 Ag/million
cells, BD PharMingen). Lin epithelial cells were suspended in HFE

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (18). September 15, 2007

at 5  106/mL, and incubated with indicated antibodies as well as
7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD; BD PharMingen) for 30 min on ice. Cells
were washed thrice in HFE, resuspended in the same buffer at 5  106/mL,
and kept on ice pending analysis. Live single cells ( fixed FSC-A/FSC-W
ratio; 7-AAD negative) were gated for analysis. Cell sorting was carried out
using FACSAria-13 color Cell Sorter (Becton Dickinson) with 488 nm Blue
laser at 30 p.s.i.
Mammosphere/tumorsphere culturing in vitro. Single-cell suspension
of Lin mammary epithelial cells or sorted cells from tumors or mammary
glands were plated on ultra–low attachment plates (Corning, Costar)
in DMEM/F-12 HAM medium (Sigma) containing 20 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor (Sigma), 20 ng/mL EGF (Sigma), 4 Ag/mL heparin
(Sigma) and B-27 supplement (1:50 dilution, Life Technologies), and
cultured at 37jC, 5% CO2. Spheres were mechanically and enzymatically
dissociated every 2 to 3 weeks in 1 (0.25%) Trypsin-EDTA solution
(Life Technologies) for 1 min at room temperature, followed by passing
through 25G needles.
In vitro differentiation and immunocytostaining. Cells were plated
on collagen 1–coated coverslips (BD Biocoat) in growth medium (DMEM/
F-12, 10% FBS, 5 Ag/mL insulin, 1 Ag/mL hydrocortisone, 5 ng/mL EGF,
and penicillin/streptomycin) for 3 to 5 days. Differentiation was induced
for 24 h in medium containing DMEM/F-12, 5 Ag/mL insulin, 1 Ag/mL
hydrocortisone, 3 Ag/mL prolactin, and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells on
coverslips were fixed in 3.5% paraformaldehyde for 5 min at room
temperature, washed with PBS (3, 3 min each), and permeabilized in
OPAS buffer (100 mmol/L PIPES, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 100 mmol/L KOH, 4%
PEG 8000, 0.1% Triton X-100) for 5 min. After washing with PBS (3, 3 min
each), samples were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin for 5 min
followed by primary antibodies for 45 min. Antibodies were rabbit anti–
smooth muscle actin (SMA, 1:200 dilution, Novus Biologics), mouse anti–
keratin 18 (K18, 1:200 dilution, Fitzgerald), and rabbit anti–keratin 14 (K14,
1:200 dilution, Panomics). Cells were washed in PBS (3, 3 min each) and
incubated for 45 min with goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (green, 1:200 dilution,
Molecular Probes) or goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 (red, 1:200 dilution,
Molecular Probes). Nuclei were visualized with 4¶,6¶-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, Sigma). Slides were washed thrice with PBS, mounted
(DakoCytomation), and analyzed under Zeiss Axioskop 2 fluorescent
microscope.
Histology and immunofluorescence staining. Paraffin-embedded
tissue samples were sectioned (4 Am) using a Reichert Ultracut E
microtome. Sections were deparaffinized by treating twice with xylene for
10 min each and sequentially hydrated in 100%, 90%, 70%, and 50% ethanol.
For histologic studies, samples were stained with hematoxylin for 15 min;
treated with 70% ethanol/1% HCl; and then stained with eosin for 5 min,
dehydrated, and mounted in Permount (Sigma). For immunofluorescence
staining, slides containing tissue sections were deparaffinized and hydrated
as above. Antigen retrieval was done by boiling samples in 10 mmol/L
sodium citrate (pH 6.0), for 10 min in microwave followed by 30 min gradual
cooling at room temperature. The slides were incubated with M.O.M. mouse
immunoglobulin blocking reagent for 1 h (Vector M.O.M Immunodetection
kit, Vector Laboratories) and then with primary antibodies (diluted in
M.O.M diluent) in a humidified chamber at 4jC overnight. Secondary
antibodies (goat anti-rabbit Alexa 488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa 568, both
1:200 dilution) and DAPI were added for 1 h at ambient temperature.
Primary antibodies were as above plus mouse monoclonal SMA antibody
(1:800 dilution, Sigma).
Transplantation. Sorted cells, dissociated tumorspheres, or whole
tumorspheres were resuspended in 10 AL medium and mixed at 1:1 ratio
with 10 AL Matrigel (BD Bioscience) on ice. The samples (total 20 AL) were
injected into no. 4 mammary glands of immunocompromised Rag1 / mice
and in subsequent experiments into syngeneic FvB mice anesthetized with
isoflurane. Liquid bandage (NewSkin) was applied to prevent sample
leakage followed by 9-mm autoclip (Clay Adams Brand).
Calculation and statistical analysis. The limit-dilution calculation was
based on a Poisson probability distribution: ln (y) = rx + ln (a), where y is
the ratio of non–tumor-generating injections, x is the number of cells
injected, and r is the frequency of TICs; a is the y intercept and it was

assumed that with no cells injected, no tumors are formed (therefore at
100% non–tumor generation, a = 1). The frequency of TICs (r) was
calculated from the slope of line best fit to the data points. Statistical
analysis was done using ANOVA and the Bonferroni tests for post hoc
analysis. Differences between values were considered statistically significant
at P < 0.05.

Results
Flow cytometry analysis with CD24 plus Sca1 but not CD49f
discerns between MMTV-Neu and MMTV-Wnt1 tumors. MMTVNeu transgenic mice carrying unactivated Neu proto-oncogene
develop undifferentiated SMA-negative adenocarcinomas after

long latency (28, 31). To identify tumor-initiating cells in MMTVNeu mammary tumors, we used a series of enrichment steps.
Nonepithelial cells were immunodepleted using hematopoietic
(CD45/Ter119), endothelial (CD31), and stromal (CD140a) antibodies (see Materials and Methods). 7AAD, a fluorescent dye that
accumulates in dead cells, was included to select for live cells.
Lineage negative (Lin ), live, single-cell populations were gated and
subsequently analyzed or sorted on the basis of cell surface marker
expression. Previous work showed an expansion of CD29hi:CD24+
progenitor/stem cell population in preneoplastic mammary glands
from MMTV-Wnt1 but not MMTV-Neu mice (29, 30). We have
reproduced these data using CD49f in place of CD29, which

was also used in combination with CD24 to identify MSCs.
Mammary glands from control wild-type littermate, MMTV-Neu,
and MMTV-Wnt1 mice exhibited f13%, 6%, and 20% CD49f+:
CD24+ double-positive cells, respectively (Fig. 1A). The percentage
of CD49f+:CD24+ cells varied depending on the mouse age, but
the pattern was similar in multiple mice (n > 5), showing a
reproducible expansion of the CD49f+:CD24+ population in Wnt1
but not Neu mammary glands. In contrast to these values obtained
from preneoplastic mammary glands, we have found a dramatic
increase in the CD49f+:CD24+ cell populations (f50%) in both
MMTV-Neu and MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors (Fig. 1B). Thus,
flow cytometry with CD24 and CD49f cannot be used to distinguish
these two mammary tumor types.
The Sca1+ fraction is enriched for MSCs (25) and is abundant in
Wnt1 but not Neu mammary tumors (28). We therefore asked
whether double labeling with CD24 and Sca1 would distinguish
Wnt1 and Neu mammary tumors. Relative to wild-type FvB
nulliparous mammary glands, MMTV-Wnt1 tumors exhibited a
2-fold increase in the Sca1+:CD24+ cell population (Fig. 1C and D).
In contrast, MMTV-Neu tumors contained less Sca1+:CD24+ cells
relative to control mammary glands and instead displayed an
expansion (70–80%) of the Sca1 :CD24+ cell population. As the
combination of CD24 and Sca1 antigens allowed us to discern
between Neu and Wnt1 tumors, we used these markers in all
subsequent experiments.
Differentiation potential of sorted MMTV-Neu tumor cells.
To define the lineage potential of tumor cell populations sorted on
the basis of Sca1 and CD24, purified Lin , 7AAD MMTV-Neu, and
MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells were sorted for Sca1 and CD24, plated on
collagen 1–coated coverslips, and cultured in growth medium
containing 10% FBS, insulin, hydrocortisone, and EGF. After 3 to
5 days, differentiation was induced for 24 h by switching to
medium containing insulin and prolactin. The cells were fixed and
stained with SMA, a myoepithelial cell marker, and cytokeratin 18
(K18), a luminal-epithelial marker. As shown in Fig. 2A, Sca1+ cells
sorted from MMTV-Neu tumors were mostly SMA positive (f85%),
CD24+ cells were almost exclusively K18 positive, and the
Sca1+:CD24+ double-positive population contained both cell types.
Sorted MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells gave similar results except that
the ratio of K18:SMA in the Sca1+:CD24+ double-positive quadrant
was nearly 1:1 in Wnt1 tumors but 4.5:1 in cells from Neu tumors
(Fig. 2C). Together with the flow cytometry profiles of these tumors
(Fig. 1C and D), these data suggest that Neu tumors contain
an increased number of progenitor cells capable of differentiating
into luminal cell types, whereas Wnt1 tumors contain a large
population of bipotent stem/early progenitor cells.
We next analyzed the expression of cytokeratin 14 (K14) after
sorting and differentiation on collagen 1 plates. K14, a bona fide
myoepithelial marker, is highly enriched in the MSC compartment
(30). Remarkably, in MMTV-Neu tumors, K14 expression did not
segregate with Sca1+ cells, as did SMA (Fig. 2A versus B). Instead,
K14 was expressed in differentiating CD24+ and Sca1+:CD24+ cells.
As shown below, these populations include TICs and TFUs.
Interestingly, all K14+ cells also expressed K18 (Fig. 2B, yellow
arrows; inset, K14 staining alone without keratin 18). In addition,
some cells exclusively expressed K18+ (Fig. 2B, red arrow). In
contrast to the tight segregation of K14+ precursor cells in MMTVNeu tumors, K14 expression in sorted MMTV-Wnt1 tumor cells
was found in all three quadrants, including the Sca1+ cells (Fig. 2B
and C). In addition, as opposed to the Neu-derived cells, most
differentiated Wnt1 tumor cells did not coexpress K14 and K18

(green arrows). Some Sca1 :CD24 double-negative cells also
expressed SMA, K14, or K18, and may represent cells that had
differentiated before the FACS sorting.
Identification of MMTV-Neu TFUs. TICs resemble stem cells
in their ability to grow as spheres when cultured under conditions in which they cannot attach to a solid substratum (32, 33).
To test for the ability of MMTV-Neu and MMTV-Wnt1 tumor
cells to grow as tumorspheres in culture, purified (Lin ) tumor
cells were plated onto ultra–low attachment plates in defined
medium containing EGF, fibroblast growth factor (FGF), heparin,
and B27 (34, 35). After 3 to 4 weeks in culture, f80% of MMTV-Neu
tumorspheres become symmetrically encapsulated to form ‘‘golf
ball’’–like structures (Fig. 3A). Figure 3B shows the kinetic of
primary MMTV-Neu tumorsphere formation over a 1-month
period. The golf ball tumorspheres became hollow and did not
grow or expand if left in culture for 1 month or longer. To
circumvent this problem, we dissociated tumorspheres every 2 to
3 weeks before they differentiated. Interestingly, only f20% of
secondary Neu tumorspheres developed into golf ball structures; the majority appeared like normal mammospheres or
Wnt1 tumorspheres.
In contrast, tumorspheres from MMTV-Wnt1 tumors did not
form golf ball–like structures even when cultured for long periods

without dissociation (Fig. 3A). Upon dissociation and replating, the
secondary and subsequent cultures formed spheres that resembled
mammospheres obtained from normal mammary glands (Fig. 3A).
When Sca1 :CD24+ cells from both MMTV-Wnt1 and MMTV-Neu
tumors were sorted and then seeded in ultra–low attachment
plates, they both retained their characteristic tumorsphere shape
(see below and data not shown).
To determine the incidence of TFUs in tumorspheres, 3-week-old
primary tumorspheres were dissociated into single cells through
light trypsinization and replated. The frequency of TFUs was f1/
700 and 1/800 for the Neu and Wnt1 tumorspheres, respectively.
As shown below, the frequency of CD49f+:CD24+ double-positive
cells is higher in fresh versus old tumorspheres; hence, the frequency of TFU may reflect specific culture conditions and frequency of trypsinization/replating of cultures.
Differentiation and tumorigenic potential of MMTV-Neu
TFUs. To test whether tumorspheres recapitulate the initial tumors
from which they were derived, we did flow cytometry analysis on
tumorspheres propagated for 3 weeks in ultra–low attachment
plates. As shown in Fig. 4A, Neu and Wnt1 tumorspheres
maintained their characteristic flow cytometry profiles. Thus,
Neu tumorspheres were enriched for CD24+ cells, whereas Wnt1
tumorspheres contained a substantial population of CD24+:Sca1+
double-positive cells. In addition, like the original tumors, Neu and
Wnt1 tumorspheres both contained a large population of
CD49f+:CD24+ double-positive cells (Figs. 1B and 4A). Similar
results were obtained from independent samples maintained for
several months in culture, as long as they were dissociated on a
regular basis every 2 to 3 weeks. If kept in culture without
dissociation, yet with constant supply of fresh growth factors (EGF
and FGF), the flow cytometry profiles of tumorspheres were
reduced to Sca1 :CD24 or CD49f :CD24 double negative. This
trend is shown in Fig. 4A for CD49f-CD24 markers: 80% to 90%
of 3-week-old secondary tumorspheres from MMTV-Wnt1 and
MMTV-Neu tumors were CD49f+:CD24+ double-positive cells,
whereas only f30% to 36% of f5-week-old tumorsphere cells
were double positive.
To investigate the differentiation potential of TFUs, the tumorspheres were dissociated, plated on collagen 1–coated coverslips,
and stained with SMA and K18. Interestingly, primary tumorsphere
from both tumor types were bipotent, giving rise to both luminal
(K18+) and myoepithelial (SMA+) cells (Fig. 4B). However, primary
MMTV-Neu tumorspheres were enriched for luminal cells (87%),
whereas MMTV-Wnt1 tumorspheres were enriched for myoepithelial cell types (62%). When secondary tumorspheres were analyzed
as above, those derived originally from MMTV-Wnt1 continued to
differentiate into both luminal and myoepithelial cell types. In
contrast, secondary MMTV-Neu tumorsphere cells differentiated
exclusively into K18+ cells (Fig. 4B). Thus, Wnt1 tumorspheres
are bipotent, whereas Neu tumorsphere cells are committed to the
luminal cell fate.
We next tested whether tumorspheres contained tumorinitiating cells. To this end, tumorspheres were dissociated and
1,000 cells were mixed with Matrigel and transplanted into fat
pads of recipient Rag-1 / mice. Full-blown tumors were detected
after 1 and 2 months from Wnt1 and Neu tumorspheres, respectively (Fig. 4C). Tumorspheres cultured for as long as 3 months
under ultra–low attachment conditions gave rise to tumors after
transplantation.
Inhibition of Neu and Wnt1 tumorsphere growth by
cytotoxic drugs. As we show below, the TFU is similar if not

identical to the TIC. We therefore asked whether we could screen
for TFU inhibitory drugs. Primary tumorspheres were dissociated
into single cells and treated with Adriamycin (doxorubicin), an
anthracycline used in single-agent treatment of breast cancer
(36, 37). The ability of the cells to form secondary tumorspheres in
the absence of the drug was determined by counting spheres 2
weeks later. A 4-h exposure to high a dose of Adriamycin (1 Ag/mL)
reduced the number of MMTV-Neu and MMTV-Wnt1 tumorspheres by 6- and 3-fold, respectively (Fig. 4D). Thus, this assay
can be used to screen for drugs/inhibitors that can suppress the
proliferation or survival of TFUs.
MMTV-Neu TFUs and TICs both arise from the Sca1+:CD24+
and Sca1 :CD24+ cell populations. We next sought to identify
MMTV-Neu tumor cells capable of giving rise to tumorspheres.
Lin tumor cells were sorted on the basis of 7AAD exclusion
(i.e., live cells) CD24 and Sca1 expression and then cells from each
quadrant were plated under tumorsphere growth conditions. When
plated at f5,000 live cells per well, MMTV-Neu tumorspheres only
formed from CD24+ or CD24+:Sca1+ cells (Fig. 5A and B). The
number of TFUs per plated cell was f1/400 and f1/2,000 for
CD24+ and CD24+:Sca1+ cell populations, respectively (Fig. 5B).
Importantly, tumorspheres obtained from sorted cells and
subsequently transplanted into recipient mice also induced
secondary tumors (data not shown). Thus, cells capable of forming
tumorspheres in culture (TFUs) cosegregate with and may be

HER2/Neu Mammary Tumor–Initiating Cells

highly related or identical to cells that can initiate tumors in vivo
(TICs).
We finally asked whether TICs are derived from the same
fraction of sorted cells that contain TFUs. To this end, Lin 7AAD
single tumor cells were labeled with CD24 and Sca1 fluorescent
antibodies, sorted into four quadrants, mixed with Matrigel, and
transplanted into FvB mouse female fat pads (Fig. 6A, left).
Incidence of secondary tumors was evaluated 6 months after
injection (Fig. 6B). When 1,000 to 5,000 Lin sorted cells were
transplanted into recipient mammary glands, all quadrants gave
rise to secondary tumors. However, when 500, 250, 100, or 50
MMTV-Neu tumor cells from double-negative or Sca1+:CD24 cells
were transplanted, no tumors were detected. In contrast, secondary
tumors developed from the Sca1+:CD24+ or Sca1 :CD24+ quadrants
after transplanting as few as 50 cells. The frequency of TICs
was calculated to be 1/303 cells and 1/286 cells from the
Sca1+:CD24+ and Sca1 :CD24+ populations, respectively. The sorted
Sca1 :CD24+ cells remained single cells, were devoid of doublets or
aggregates, and contained very few 7AAD+ dead cells, suggesting
that the sorting process did not compromise the properties or
viability of the TICs (Fig. 6A, right).
We note that as with TFUs, MMTV-Neu TICs were found
exclusively in CD24+ populations (Sca1+:CD24+ or Sca1 :CD24+).
However, although the frequency of TFU (1/400) and TIC (1/286) in
the Sca1 :CD24+ quadrant was relatively similar, the CD24+:Sca1+
double-positive cell fraction contained significantly higher levels of
TICs (1/303) than TFUs (f1/2,000; Figs. 5 and 6). These disparity
may reflect differences in the dependency of Sca1 :CD24+ and
Sca1+:CD24+ TICs on the mammary gland microenvironment.
Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the newly developed
secondary tumors exhibited similar CD24-Sca1 profiles as the
original MMTV-Neu tumors. Remarkably, sorted Sca1 :CD24+ and
Sca1+:CD24+ populations both induced tumors with similar Sca1CD24 profiles (Fig. 6A). The histology of secondary tumors,
undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, was also indistinguishable from
that of primary tumors (Fig. 6C). Moreover, immunofluorescent
analysis with antibodies against K18, SMA, and K14 revealed very
similar patterns of marker expression in primary and secondary
tumors (Fig. 6D). Both primary and secondary MMTV-Neu tumors
expressed patches of K18-positive areas and no K14- or SMApositive cells. In contrast, primary MMTV-Wnt1 tumors contained
multiple, yet not continuous, areas with K18+, SMA+, and K14+
cells. We conclude that the Sca1+/ :CD24+ MMTV-Neu cell populations contain bona fide TICs capable of regenerating the initial
tumors.

Discussion
We here report on the identification and similarities between
TICs and TFUs in MMTV-Neu tumors. One parsimonious model
that encompasses all our results is that Neu tumors originate from

the transformation of luminal precursors. First, MMTV-Neu tumors
have increased number of Sca1 :CD24+ cells that represent luminal
precursors (Figs. 1C and 2). Second, MMTV-Neu TICs were found
within bipotent or luminal (Sca1 :CD24+) progenitor cell compartments (Figs. 1 and 6). Third, TFUs also were found within bipotent/
luminal (Sca1+/ :CD24+) progenitor compartments in Neu tumors
(Fig. 5). Fourth, Neu tumors do not express myoepithelial markers
(Fig. 6D). Fifth, MMTV-Neu secondary TFUs differentiate exclusively into luminal (K18+) cells (Fig. 4B). Together, these observations support the notion that Neu TICs represent transformed
luminal precursor cells.
However, other observations are not easily reconciled with this
model. First, like MMTV-Wnt1 tumors, MMTV-Neu tumor cells
exhibit expansions of the CD49f+:CD24+ cell population, which
marks MSCs (Fig. 1B). Second, although Neu tumors do not
contain myoepithelial cells expressing SMA or K14, sorted Sca1+
cells from Neu tumors as well as primary tumorspheres do
differentiate in vitro into cells that express these myoepithelial
markers (Figs. 2 and 4B). Third, although sorted Wnt1 tumor cells
differentiated into cells expressing either luminal (K18) or myoepithelial (K14) markers, all differentiated Neu tumor cells that
expressed K14 also expressed K18 (Fig. 2B).
The model described above can nonetheless be extended to
incorporate these observations as well. The Neu oncogene may
target luminal progenitors cells but induce them to revert into less
differentiated stem/early progenitor–like cells capable of selfrenewal, reexpress K14, and differentiate into luminal as well as
myoepithelial cell types under favorable conditions. In this view,
despite the fact that Neu tumor cells do not express K14 or SMA,
they may posses some potential to differentiate into both major
epithelia lineages; however, this does not occur in vivo. Similarly,
MLL can be induced by oncogenic transformation of progenitor
cells and activation of self-renewal genes (11).
In a second model, the Neu oncogene may transform stem/early
progenitor cells but provide instructive cues to differentiate
specifically into luminal cell fate or to specifically restrict
differentiation into the myoepithelial lineage. Such a function
would be reminiscent of the Notch-RBP-J pathway, which
maintains luminal cell fate during pregnancy by preventing basal
cell proliferation (38). Both models are consistent with the gene
profiles associated with HER2-positive tumors that include luminal
as well as Basal ‘‘A’’ (K5 and K14 positive; ref. 39 and references
therein). Indeed, as we have shown herein, although MMTV-Neu
mammary tumors are invariably negative for SMA and K14 (Fig. 6),
Neu tumor cells do differentiate into SMA+ and K14+ cells in vitro
(Fig. 2). These opposing models may be tested by sorting MSCs and
luminal progenitor cells, inducing transformation by activated Neu
oncogene and then analyzing which transformed cell type
resembles MMTV-Neu/HER2 tumors. An additional approach
may involve the analysis of myoepithelial cell differentiation after
inhibiting Neu signaling.

Cancer Research

The ability of Neu TICs and TFUs to induce secondary tumors
and tumorspheres shows their capacity to self-renew. In this
context, we note that by reverse transcription-PCR analysis, we
have detected Sox2, Oct4, and Nanog, which are involved in
maintenance of stemness in embryonic stem cells, in RNA
extracted from embryonic stem cells but not from Wnt1 or Neu
tumorspheres.5 Whether these genes are expressed exclusively in
TFUs but turned off in more differentiated progenitor cells remains
to be seen and will require purification of TFUs and TIC to near
homogeneity. Interestingly, Notch and Notch ligands, which are
implicated in self-renewal and are elevated in aggressive forms of
breast cancer (40), were readily identified in Wnt1 tumorspheres6;
their expression in Neu tumorspheres is yet to be determined.
A nonbiased microarray analysis of highly purified TICs may
unravel whether MSCs, Wnt1, and Neu TICs share a common set of
self-renewal genes.
Mammary colony-forming cells (CFC), defined as progenitors
that produce colonies in low cell density adherent cultures, can be
physically and functionally separated from mammary repopulating
units (MRU), which mark MSCs (30). Notably, however, mammary
CFCs are cultured under different conditions than mammospheres.
It would therefore be important to establish the relationship
between cells capable of forming mammospheres in nonadherent
cultures (as opposed to mammary CFC) and MRUs. Indeed, our
results suggest that TICs are similar, if not identical, to TFUs. These
include our observations that (a) TICs and TFUs cofractionate; (b)
the flow cytometry profiles of primary tumors and tumorspheres is
highly similar; and most importantly (c) tumorspheres arising from

sorted cells can give rise to secondary tumors after transplantation

the identification and development of TIC-specific therapy. Largescale screening for tumorsphere growth inhibitors could be readily
adopted on the basis of Fig. 4D. Of particular interest would
be the identification of inhibitors that alone or together with
conventional chemotherapy and/or Herceptin can target Neu
tumorspheres but not normal mammospheres. The use of mammospheres as negative control would be crucial to rule out
inhibitors that may affect the EGF/FGF pathways, required for
maintaining both tumorspheres and mammospheres in culture, or
various essential, nononcogenic processes. Such screens can be
easily extended to tumorspheres derived from other important
mouse models of sporadic and heritable forms of breast cancer.
The use of mouse models of mammary tumors described here
offers several advantages over the use of human breast tumors or
pleural effusions. The mouse mammary tumor models provide
ample and accessible source of primary tumors with relatively
uniform genetic background. In addition, the power of mouse
genetics may allow us to modulate gene expression and test for
effect of various signaling/developmental pathways and specific
inhibitors on the growth of mammary tumorspheres and TICs both
in vitro and in vivo.
