Abstract
Estrogen receptors (ER) are expressed in f65% of human
breast cancer. Cumulative data from clinical trials and
retrospective analyses suggest that some chemotherapeutic
agents may be less effective in patients with ER-positive (ER+)
tumors than those with ER-negative (ER ) tumors. Paclitaxel
is an active agent used in breast cancer chemotherapy. To
investigate the possible influence of ER on the therapeutic
efficacy of paclitaxel and its underlying mechanism, we
established several isogenic ER+ cell lines by stable transfection of ERA expression vectors into ER breast cancer BCap37
cells. We showed that 17-B estradiol significantly reduces the
overall cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in BCap37-expressing ERA
but has no influence on the ER parental cells. Further
analyses indicate that expression of ERA in BCap37 cells
mainly interferes with paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death,
without affecting paclitaxel-induced microtubule bundling
and mitotic arrest. Moreover, we found that the addition of ICI
182,780 (Fulvestrant), a selective ER down-regulator, could
completely reverse the resistance of ER+ BCap37 cells to
paclitaxel. These findings showed that ERA-mediated breast
tumor cell resistance to paclitaxel was through selective
inhibition of paclitaxel-induced tumor cell apoptosis. Additionally, the combination of ICI 182,780 also sensitizes MCF-7
and T47D cell lines to the treatment of paclitaxel, which
further confirmed the correlation between ERA and drug
resistance in ER+ tumor cells. The results obtained from this
study provide useful information for understanding ERmediated resistance to paclitaxel and possibly other antineoplastic agents. [Cancer Res 2007;67(11):5337–44]

Introduction
Estrogen receptors (ER) are transcriptional factors that play an
important role in the development and progression of breast
cancers (1–3). Cumulative analysis of tumor biopsies has shown
that ERs are present in f65% of human breast tumors (4). It has
long been known that breast cancers that express the ERa protein
(ER+) behave in a fundamentally different fashion than ER-negative
(ER ) tumors with regard to their response to hormonal therapies
(4–6). In recent years, data from clinical trials or retrospective
analyses suggested that ER status might also affect the efficacy of
chemotherapy (7–10). Specifically, it has been observed that some
chemotherapeutic agents may be less effective in patients with ER+
tumors than those with ER tumors. These findings indicate that

ER status may play an important role in determining the sensitivity
of breast tumors to chemotherapy, although the mechanisms
underlying ER-mediated drug resistance are not entirely clear
(8, 11–13).
Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel), a novel class of naturally
occurring antimicrotubule agents, represent active chemotherapeutic agents developed in the last two decades for the treatment
of malignancies, including breast cancer (14, 15). However, not all
breast tumors are sensitive to taxanes. Evidence is accumulating
that improvements in taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy disproportionately benefit patients with ER breast tumors (9, 16, 17).
Indeed, such a finding has also been observed in our in vitro
experiments (18). In earlier studies, we characterized the possible
correlation of the activation of nuclear factor-nB (NF-nB)/InB
pathway with the susceptibility of tumor cells to paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis (18–20). We found that the breast cancer cell line MCF-7
was highly resistant to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis although it was
still responsive to paclitaxel in microtubule bundling and mitotic
arrest (18). However, we did not appreciate that this resistance
might be associated with ER status. Recently, we found that both
paclitaxel-sensitive cell lines (human breast cancer cell line BCap37
and ovarian cancer cell line OV2008) used in this comparative
study are ER (see Fig. 1A). This finding raised the possibility that
the insensitivity of MCF-7 cell line to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis
might be correlated to its ER.
Therefore, in this study, we determined whether the differential
sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel might be a
consequence of ERa expression. Through stable transfection of
an ERa expression vector into ER BCap37 cells, we found that, in
the presence of 17-h estradiol, the expression of ERa in BCap37
cells is clearly associated with decreased sensitivity to paclitaxel.
Analyses including DNA fragmentation, flow cytometry, and
terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated nick end labeling
(TUNEL) assays indicate that 17-h estradiol significantly interferes
with the ability of paclitaxel to induce apoptosis in BCap37 cells
transfected with ERa, but not in parental ER BCap37 cells.
Moreover, ICI 182,780 (Fulvestrant), a steroidal pure antiestrogen
agent (21, 22), dramatically down-regulates ERa protein levels and
nearly completely reverses the resistance to paclitaxel in BCap37
cells transfected with ERa. Meanwhile, the combination of ICI
182,780 was also found to sensitize ER+ MCF-7 and T47D cells to
paclitaxel, which provided additional evidence that expression and
subsequent activation of ERa are associated with resistance to
paclitaxel in breast cancer cells.

Figure 1. ERa expression attenuates the overall cytotoxicity of paclitaxel.
A, whole cellular protein extracts of BCap37 cells transfected with empty vector
or ERa were analyzed by Western blot with an anti-ERa antibody as
described in Materials and Methods. T47D and MCF-7 cells were used as
positive controls of ERa expression. B, MTT assays. Cells cultured in 96-well
microplates were treated with 1 nmol/L 17-h estradiol, 50 nmol/L paclitaxel,
or the combination treatment in which cells were preincubated with 17-h estradiol
for 12 h before paclitaxel treatment. Cell viability was evaluated by MTT
assays after both 48 and 72 h of paclitaxel treatment. Columns, mean of three

Paclitaxel and 17-h estradiol were purchased from Sigma and dissolved in
100% DMSO and ethanol, respectively. ICI 182,780 was purchased from
Tocris and dissolved in DMSO. Cells were cultured in phenol-free medium
containing 10% dextran-coated, charcoal-treated FCS (Hyclone) before they
were treated with 17-h estradiol, paclitaxel, and ICI 182,780 alone or in
combination.
Stable transfection and selection of ERA-transfected cells. The
pIRES expression vector containing a cytomegalovirus promoter and the
pIRES-ERa expression vector have been used in our previous studies
(23, 24). Transfection was done by Lipofectin (Life Technologies) as
recommended by the manufacturer. Briefly, ER BCap37 cells cultured in
6-cm dishes were washed twice and supplemented with 3 mL Opti-MEM
reduced serum medium. pIRES-ERa or pIRES plasmid DNA (2 Ag per 6-cm
dish) was mixed with Lipofectin before addition to tumor cells. After
transfection, stable transfectants were selected by incubating with
500 Ag/mL geneticin (G418). Surviving colonies were picked f2 weeks

later. Single colonies were amplified and examined for ERa expression by
Western blotting. Positive clones were maintained in culture medium
supplemented with 250 Ag/mL G418.
3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
assays. Drug-induced cytotoxicity was determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays as described
previously (19). Briefly, tumor cells were evenly cultured into 96-well tissue
culture plates for approximately overnight and then treated with designated
drugs. At the end of experiments, MTT solution was added into the 96-well
plates and the plates were incubated for additional 3 h, allowing viable cells
to reduce the yellow tetrazolium salt (MTT) into dark blue formazan
crystals. Finally, DMSO was added to dissolve the formazan crystals. The
absorbance in individual wells was determined at 562 nm by a microplate
reader.
Detection of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. After exposure to
treatments, both parental BCap37 and ERa-transfected clones were
harvested and suspended in lysis solution for 30 min on ice. Crude DNA
samples were extracted twice with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol
(25:24:1). The remaining steps for detection of DNA fragmentation were
done as described previously (25). DNA samples were analyzed by
electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose slab gel containing 0.2 Ag/mL ethidium
bromide and visualized under UV illumination.
TUNEL assay. The TUNEL assay was carried out using the method
previously described (26–28). Briefly, cells were trypsinized and affixed to
slides by using a Cytospin 3 (Shandon) cell preparation system after various
treatments. The slides were air dried and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde,
followed by TUNEL staining according to the manufacturer’s protocol of a
commercial kit (Roche). 3,3¶-Diaminobenzidine was used as a substrate for
signal conversion (28). Apoptotic cells were identified by positive TUNEL
staining and five randomly selected microscopic fields in each group were
used to calculate the relative ratio of TUNEL-positive cells.
Flow cytometric analysis. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis was
further determined by flow cytometric analysis. Cell sample preparation
was done as described previously (29). Briefly, at the end of each time point,
cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol diluted in PBS. Cells were
then incubated in PBS containing 100 Ag/mL RNase and 40 Ag/mL
propidium iodide at room temperature for 0.5 to 1.0 h before flow cytometry
analysis. Cell cycle distribution and DNA content were determined using a
Coulter Epics V instrument with an argon laser set to excite at 488 nm. The
results were analyzed using Elite 4.0 software (Phoenix Flow System).
Cytospin preparation. After designated treatments, BCap37 cells with
or without expression of ERa were harvested by trypsinization and washed
with PBS. Approximately 0.5  105 to 1  105 cells were plated onto
microscope slides using the Cytospin 3 cell preparation system. As
described previously (30), slides were air dried and fixed in absolute
methanol before Giemsa staining. Slides from three independent experiments were examined and photographed using bright-field microscopy. Five
randomly selected microscopic fields with at least 500 cells were counted to
calculate the percentage of mitotic cells in each group. Only those cells with
typical morphologic features of condensed chromosomes were counted as
mitotically arrested cells.
Immunofluorescence staining of microtubules. Cells were allowed to
adhere to Lab-Tek II chamber glass slides overnight and subsequently
treated with 17-h estradiol and paclitaxel as described above. After 24 h of
paclitaxel treatment, cells were gently washed with PBS and fixed in 100%
methanol for 10 min. Cells were permeabilized for 10 min with 0.2% Triton
X-100, followed by blocking at room temperature for 30 min in 5% bovine
serum albumin. After washing thrice with PBS, cells were stained with
FITC-conjugated anti–a-tubulin monoclonal antibody (Clone DM1A, Sigma)
in a dark chamber for 1 h at room temperature (18, 31). Cells were washed
with PBS before mounting and imaged with Zeiss LSM 510 confocal
microscope.
Western blotting. Cellular protein was isolated with a protein extraction
buffer containing 150 mmol/L NaCl, 10 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.2), 5 mmol/L
EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol, and 1% SDS. Equal amounts
(40 Ag/lane) of proteins were fractionated on 10% to 12% SDS-PAGE gels
and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes

were incubated with anti-ERa (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), InBa (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology), bcl-2 (DAKO), c-raf (BD Biosciences), and cyclin B1 (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology) primary antibodies, respectively. After washing with
PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20, the membranes were incubated with
peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies
(Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) followed by enhanced chemiluminescent staining using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).
Statistical analysis. Data are presented as mean F SE of three

Results
Stable transfection and expression of ERA in BCap37 cells.
The human beast cancer BCap37 cell line has been used as a wellcharacterized cell model in our previous studies for the evaluation
of taxane-containing combination therapy (19, 20, 30–32). This
ER cell line is very sensitive to paclitaxel and docetaxel in both
mitotic arrest and apoptosis. To investigate the possible influence
of ER status on the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel or
possibly other chemotherapeutic agents, we restored expression of
ERa in BCap37 cells through stable transfection of ERa expression
vector (pIRES-ERa). Western blotting confirmed the expression of
exogenous ERa in clones transfected with pIRES-ERa cDNA. As
shown in Fig. 1A, the BCap37 cell line transfected with empty
vector does not express ERa (lane 1, BC-V ), whereas the pooled
ERa transfectants (lane 8, BC-ER) and individual ERa-transfected
clones 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 (lanes 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7), express high levels of
exogenous ERa that are similar to T47D and MCF-7 cells (lanes 9
and 10), two recognized ERa-positive human breast cancer cell
lines (33). Clone 4 does not express detectable ERa protein (lane 5)
and was not used for further studies.
BCap37 cells expressing ERA exhibit reduced sensitivity to
paclitaxel. Next, we did MTT assays to determine whether the
expression of ERa would affect the sensitivity of BCap37 cells to
paclitaxel. Briefly, the cells transfected with empty vector (BC-V),
pooled transfectants (BC-ER), and three selected ERa-positive
individual clones (BC-ER1, BC-ER3, and BC-ER6) were treated with
50 nmol/L paclitaxel with or without pretreatment of 1 nmol/L
17-h estradiol administered 12 h before paclitaxel treatment. MTT
assays were done after cells were exposed to paclitaxel for 48 and
72 h, respectively. As depicted in Fig. 1B, we found that 1 nmol/L
17-h estradiol alone showed little effect on cell viability in all cell
lines tested. In the absence of 17-h estradiol, ERa-transfected cell
lines exhibited similar (BC-ER, BC-ER1, and BC-ER3) or slightly
decreased (BC-ER6) sensitivity to paclitaxel compared with the
vector-transfected cells (BC-V). However, in the presence of 17-h
estradiol, the cell viabilities after paclitaxel treatment were much
higher in all cell lines transfected with ERa than that of the cell line
transfected with vector only (P < 0.05 or P < 0.001; see Fig. 1B).
These results indicate that, in the presence of 17-h estradiol, the
overall cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel were significantly reduced in
the BCap37 cells expressing ERa.
Expression of ERA represses paclitaxel-induced apoptosis.
Next, we examined the possible inhibitory effect of ERa on the
ability of paclitaxel to induce tumor cell apoptosis. DNA fragmentation assays were done after BC-V cells, BC-ER1, and BC-ER6
clones were exposed to paclitaxel for 48 h. As shown in Fig. 2A, the
characteristic DNA fragmentation ladders were observed in all
three cell lines treated with 50 nmol/L paclitaxel alone (lanes 4, 8,
and 12). Pretreatment with 17-h estradiol did not affect paclitaxel-

induced apoptosis in BC-V cells (Fig. 2A, lane 5), but it significantly
attenuated paclitaxel-induced DNA fragmentation ladders in both
clones expressing ERa (lanes 9 and 13). Further, TUNEL assay was
carried out to evaluate the frequency of apoptosis. As shown in
Fig. 2B, there was no significant difference in the percentage of
TUNEL-positive cells between groups exposed to paclitaxel alone
or the combination with 17-h estradiol and paclitaxel in BC-V cells
(18.07% versus 16.33%, P > 0.05). However, there were significantly
fewer TUNEL-positive cells in the group cotreated with 17-h
estradiol than those treated with paclitaxel alone in BC-ER6 cells
(19.72% versus 8.69%, P < 0.001). Moreover, the flow cytometric
analysis also indicates that in BC-ER6 cell line, the apoptotic peak
(Fig. 3, AP) induced by paclitaxel alone was much higher than that
of cotreatment with 17-h estradiol (particularly at 72 h), but
estrogen has little effect on paclitaxel in the parental BC-V cells.
These results show that 17-h estradiol markedly inhibited
paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death in BCap37 cells expressing
exogenous ERa.
Expression of ERA has little influence on paclitaxel-induced
mitotic arrest. In our previous studies, we found that glucocorticoids could selectively inhibit paclitaxel-induced apoptosis without
interfering with paclitaxel-mediated mitotic arrest (19, 31, 34, 35).

Figure 3. Flow cytometric analyses of cell
cycle distribution and apoptosis. Cells
treated with 1 nmol/L 17-h estradiol,
50 nmol/L paclitaxel, or their combination
for indicated time points were harvested,
and DNA content stained with propidium
iodide for flow cytometric analysis. Peaks
corresponding to G1, G2-M, and S phases
of the cell cycle and apoptotic cells (AP ).

To investigate whether a similar effect is also observed for ERmediated resistance to paclitaxel, we compared the influence of
preincubation with 17-h estradiol on the ability of paclitaxel to
arrest tumor cells at G2-M phase in BCap37 cells with or without
expression of ERa. From the flow cytometry results presented in
Fig. 3, we observed that, after 48 h of paclitaxel treatment, the
majority of tumor cells were accumulated at G2-M phase in both
BC-V and BC-ER6 cell lines. Although preincubation with 17-h
estradiol has little effect in BC-V cell line, it significantly decreases
the population of cells at G2-M phase in the BC-ER6 cell line
compared with the treatment of paclitaxel alone. Instead, most of
the tumor cells remain at G1 phase of the cell cycle. Similar results
were obtained after 72 h of paclitaxel treatment, which was
accompanied with a decreased apoptotic population of tumor cells
in BC-ER6 cells. These data indicate that 17-h estradiol attenuates
paclitaxel-induced G2-M arrest in BCap37 cells transfected with
ERa. However, because flow cytometric assay could not distinguish
cells at G2 phase from M phase, we were unable to determine
whether estrogen prevents tumor cells from entering G2 phase or
M phase, or both. To clarify this issue, we prepared cytospin slides
in which the mitotically arrested cells were easily identified by
their morphologic features (e.g., condensed chromosomes; ref. 30).
Through bright-field microscopy, we found that, compared with

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

BC-ER6 cells treated with paclitaxel alone, the number of cells
arrested at the mitotic phase was only slightly less when cells
were preincubated with estrogen (48.93% versus 44.31%, P > 0.05;
Fig. 4A). We estimate that such a marginal alteration in the cell
numbers arrested at mitotic phase was caused by the ability of
estrogen to increase the G1 population rather than affect the
cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel on mitotic arrest.
Expression of ERA does not affect paclitaxel-induced
microtubule bundling. To further determine the possible
influence of ERa on the antimicrotubule activity of paclitaxel, we
did immunofluorescence staining to determine whether the
expression of ERa could directly affect the ability of paclitaxel to
alter microtubule structures. BC-V and BC-ER6 cells cultured on
glass slides were treated with 50 nmol/L paclitaxel in the presence
or absence of 1 nmol/L 17-h estradiol. After 24 h of paclitaxel
incubation, the microtubule network was visualized by immunofluorescence staining with an anti–a-tubulin antibody. As shown
in Fig. 4B, in control and 17-h estradiol-treated groups, most cells
had a fine microtubule network that excluded the nucleus and
extended throughout the cytoplasm. However, treatment with
paclitaxel in BC-V and BC-ER6 cells enhanced microtubule polymerization as visualized by distinctive rigidity, increased density of
cellular microtubules, and formation of microtubule bundles

around the nucleus. However, the morphology of microtubule
structures in cells cotreated with 17-h estradiol and paclitaxel was
quite similar to that treated with paclitaxel alone in both BC-V and
BC-ER6 cell lines. These data suggest that the expression of ERa
has little influence on the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel on
microtubules and mitotic arrest.
Expression of ERA alters expression of apoptosis-associated
proteins. The data mentioned above reveal that stable transfection
and expression of ERa result in reduced sensitivity of BCap37 cells
to paclitaxel, particularly to paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death.
To investigate the potential mechanisms and genes that may be
involved in these processes, we examined several regulatory
proteins associated with the G2-M phase of the cell cycle and
paclitaxel-induced apoptosis. The results depicted in Fig. 5 indicate
that several apoptosis associated proteins exhibit differential
responses to paclitaxel in BC-ER cells. We first analyzed the
possible alterations of InBa and bcl-2 that were previously reported
to play important roles in paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (19, 20, 36,
37). Estrogen alone has no effect on either InBa or bcl-2 expression.
As reported previously (19, 30), paclitaxel causes bcl-2 phosphorylation and degradation of InBa. However, in BC-ER cells,
pretreatment with 17-h estradiol attenuated the paclitaxel-induced
bcl-2 phosphorylation and InBa down-regulation. The responses of
c-raf to paclitaxel and 17-h estradiol treatment are quite similar to
bcl-2. Additionally, we also examined the expression of cyclin B1, a
G2-M checkpoint protein (30, 38). The results indicated that the
protein levels of cyclin B1 were increased in response to paclitaxel,

but there was no significant difference in the cells with or without
expression of ERa.
ICI 182,780 sensitizes ER+ breast cancer cells to paclitaxel.
To further confirm the direct correlation between ERa and the
resistance to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells, we studied whether
‘‘knockdown’’ of ERa would abrogate the resistance to paclitaxel.
ICI 182,780, a novel specific ER down-regulator that is currently
in clinical practice (21, 22), was used to answer this question.
First, parental BC-V cells and cells transfected with ERa were
treated with 100 nmol/L ICI 182,780, 1 nmol/L 17-h estradiol, and
50 nmol/L paclitaxel, alone or in combinations. MTT assays and
DNA fragmentation were done to evaluate the cell viability and the
sensitivity to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, respectively. As indicated in Fig. 6, pretreatment with ICI 182,780 completely prevents
17-h estradiol-induced resistance to paclitaxel as well as paclitaxelinduced DNA fragmentation in BC-ER6 cells (Fig. 6A). In BC-V cell
line, neither ICI 182,780 nor its combination with 17-h estradiol,
had significant effect on overall cytotoxicity or induction of DNA
fragmentation. Moreover, we showed that the treatment with ICI
182,780 significantly down-regulated the protein levels of ERa in
BC-ER6 cells (Fig. 6B, lanes 5–8 in panel 1). Similar to the results
shown in Fig. 5, pretreatment with 17-h estradiol attenuated the
paclitaxel-induced down-regulation of InBa (Fig. 6B, lane 3 in
panel 2). Interestingly, the addition of ICI 182,780 effectively
restored the sensitivity of BC-ER6 cells to paclitaxel-induced InBa
degradation in the presence of 17-h estradiol (Fig. 6B, lane 8 in
panel 2). Next, MCF-7 and T47D cell lines were used to determine

whether knockdown of endogenous ERa would also increase the
sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel. Our data indicate
that the pretreatment with 1 Amol/L ICI 182,780 for 12 h
significantly sensitizes both MCF-7 and T47D cells to paclitaxel
(Fig. 6C, P < 0.01 at both concentrations of paclitaxel). Similar to
the phenomena observed in BC-ER cells (Fig. 6B), ICI 182,780
effectively down-regulates the protein levels of ERa in MCF-7 and
T47D cells (Fig. 6D, lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8 in panel 1), as well as
enhanced paclitaxel-induced down-regulation of InBa (Fig. 6D,
lanes 8 and 9 in panel 2). These results indicate that downregulation of ERa protein by ICI 182,780 significantly reverses
ER-mediated resistance and produces an additive or even synergistic effect in ER+ breast tumor cells treated with paclitaxel.

Discussion
Drug resistance is one of the major obstacles limiting the success
of cancer chemotherapy. Biological mechanisms contributing to
drug resistance may be present de novo or arise after exposure to
anticancer drugs (39, 40). In this field, the most widely studied
phenomenon is multidrug resistance that has been linked to
overexpression of a membrane associated P-glycoprotein (39). In
recent years, both clinical observations and experimental studies
suggested that steroid hormones and their receptors might also
affect the therapeutic efficacy of antineoplastic drugs (7–13). For
example, our previous studies showed that glucocorticoids, such as
dexamethasone, could significantly interfere with the antitumor
activities of paclitaxel in vitro and in vivo (19, 28, 31, 35). In the
present study, we investigated the potential influence of ERa on the
therapeutic effects of paclitaxel and its underlying mechanisms.
Through stable transfection of an ERa expression vector into ERanegative BCap37 cells, we have successfully established several

Cancer Res 2007; 67: (11). June 1, 2007

individual ER+ BCap37 cell lines. Subsequently, we showed that
restoration of ERa expression in ER tumor cells could
significantly reduce the sensitivity of tumor cells to paclitaxel.
The results presented above show that ERa mainly interferes with
the cytotoxic effects of paclitaxel on apoptotic cell death, although
it also slightly affects paclitaxel-induced G2-M arrest due to the
ERa-mediated increase in the G1 phase. These findings suggest that
ER status might play an important role in determining the
sensitivity of breast tumors to paclitaxel and possibly other
chemotherapeutic agents.
Paclitaxel is a naturally occurring antimitotic agent that is active
in the treatment of a variety of human solid tumors, including
breast cancer (14, 15). However, not all breast tumors are sensitive
to paclitaxel. Cumulative data from clinical observations and
retrospective analyses suggested that ER status might affect the
therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel because it has been observed that
paclitaxel exhibited less effect in patients with ER+ breast tumors
than those with ER tumors (7, 9, 16). Moreover, the phenomenon of
ER-mediated resistance to paclitaxel has also been observed in
in vitro experiments (17, 41). However, most of these results were
obtained based on comparative studies between the tumor cell
lines derived from different individuals (17). Although some paired
cell lines were derived under the selective pressure of a low/no
estrogen environments, these tumor cells are still not likely to be
isogenic because many features, including their proliferative
capacity, might have changed due to genetic alterations (41). Thus,
it is difficult to elucidate the cellular and molecular mechanisms.
Therefore, the pairs of isogenic breast cell lines generated by stable
transfection of ERa or empty vector may provide us a valuable
model system to investigate the mechanism underlying ERamediated breast tumor cell resistance to paclitaxel and possibly
other chemotherapeutic agents.
Our previous studies found that glucocorticoids selectively
inhibited paclitaxel-induced apoptosis without affecting the ability
of paclitaxel to induce microtubule bundling and G2-M arrest in
breast cancer cells (31, 34, 35). This finding implies that apoptotic
cell death induced by paclitaxel may occur via a signaling pathway
independent of microtubule and G2-M arrest (19, 35). In the present
study, we did a series of assays to examine whether the ERmediated tumor cells resistance to paclitaxel is due to a similar
mechanism. By DNA fragmentation and TUNEL assays, we
determined that, similar to glucocorticoids, estrogen could
significantly interfere with the ability of paclitaxel to induce
apoptosis in BCap37 cells expressing exogenous ERa (Fig. 2).
However, unlike with glucocorticoids, the proportion of the cell
population at G2-M phase in the ER+ cells exposed to paclitaxel
and estrogen seemed to be less than that of the cells treated with
paclitaxel alone (Fig. 3). This phenomenon raises a question of
whether estrogen can also affect the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel
on microtubule bundling and mitotic arrest. Thus, we did immunofluorescence staining to determine whether estrogen can affect
the cytotoxic effect of paclitaxel on microtubules. Interestingly, we
found that estrogen had marginal effect on microtubule dynamics
in the cells treated with paclitaxel (Fig. 4B), but may decrease the
G2-M population through the increase of cells at the G1 phase
(Fig. 3), which is similar to the phenomena observed by Zajchowski
et al. (42). Further, we did cytospin assays and confirmed that
estrogen has little effect on mitotic arrest (Fig. 4A). These interesting results suggest that reactivation of the ER pathway may
interrupt specific downstream events of paclitaxel-induced mitotic
arrest, or inhibition of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by activation of

Estrogen Receptor a Mediates Resistance to Paclitaxel

ERa may occur via a pathway independent of mitotic arrest.
However, the question still remains whether G1 arrest and
decreased G2-M arrest by estrogen may affect paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis. Further studies are required to elucidate this issue.
To investigate the possible molecular mechanisms by which ERa
mediates resistance to paclitaxel, we have examined several genes
or regulatory proteins that may contribute to paclitaxel activity in
inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our data indicate that
paclitaxel caused bcl-2 and c-raf phosphorylation, and InBa
degradation in both BC-V and BC-ER cell lines (Fig. 5). However,
the pretreatment with 17-h estradiol could inhibit all of the above
alterations induced by paclitaxel in BC-ER cells, although it has no
effect in BC-V cells (Fig. 5). InBa is the specific cytoplasmic
inhibitory protein of NF-nB. The degradation of InBa may result
in the activation of NF-nB (43). Our recent studies have suggested
that activation of the NF-nB/InBa signaling pathway plays an
active role in mediating paclitaxel-induced apoptosis (18–20).
Interestingly, the addition of the antiestrogen agent ICI 182,780
could completely reverse the above ERa-mediated inhibition of
paclitaxel-induced InBa degradation (Fig. 6B). These results may
explain in part the interference of ERa with paclitaxel-induced
apoptosis and suggest that the NF-nB/InBa signaling pathway may
play an active role in this process. In addition, it is well known that
cyclin B1 is periodically expressed in the cell cycle and accumulates
in the G2-M phase (30, 38). Our results indicate that paclitaxel
causes increased levels of cyclin B1 in both BC-V and BC-ER cells,
which coincides with paclitaxel-induced G2-M arrest irrespective
of the ER status. When cells were pretreated with 17-h estradiol
before paclitaxel, the up-regulation of cyclin B1 was still present,
consistent with the data obtained from cytospin and microtubule staining showing that ERa expression has little effect on
paclitaxel-induced mitotic arrest. These findings provide addi-

tional insights into the molecular mechanism of ERa-mediated
resistance to paclitaxel in breast cancer cells.
ICI 182,780 is an effective ER antagonist that reduces cellular
levels of ERs (21, 22). To further confirm the finding that ERa
mediates resistance to paclitaxel, we examined whether the
knockdown of ERa by ICI 182,780 would resensitize BC-ER,
MCF-7, and T47D cells to paclitaxel. The results show that the
addition of ICI 182,780 dramatically reverses the resistance of these
tumor cells to paclitaxel (Fig. 6). These results provided additional
evidence for the correlation between ERa and the resistance to
paclitaxel in breast cancer cells. Because ICI 182,780 has been
successfully used in the treatment of ER+ advanced breast cancers,
our experimental results also provide evidence for the clinical
strategy to combine ICI 182,780 and paclitaxel in the treatment of
ER+ breast tumors. Additionally, we found that this pure
antiestrogen agent has more activity in reversing 17-h estradiolinduced resistance to paclitaxel in BC-ER cells, when compared
with tamoxifen, a selective ER modulator (data not shown).
In summary, the present study has investigated the possible
influence of ERa on the therapeutic effects of paclitaxel on breast
cancer cells. Through establishment of several isogenic cell lines by
stable transfection of ERa expression vectors into ER breast
cancer cells, we have shown that 17-h estradiol significantly
reduces the overall cytotoxicity of paclitaxel in BCap37-expressing
ERa. Further analyses indicate that expression of ERa in BCap37
cells mainly interferes with paclitaxel-induced apoptotic cell death,
and has little effect on the ability of paclitaxel to induce
microtubule bundling and mitotic arrest. Additionally, we found
that the addition of ICI 182,780, a selective ER inhibitor that can
down-regulate the ERa protein levels, could completely reverse the
ER-mediated resistance and sensitize ER+ BCap37, MCF-7, and
T47D cells to paclitaxel. Put together, these findings suggest that

ER status might play an important role in determining the
sensitivity of breast cancer to paclitaxel and possibly other
chemotherapeutic agents. The results obtained from this study
may provide useful information for understanding ER-mediated
resistance to paclitaxel and improving the clinical application of
this class of antineoplastic agents.
