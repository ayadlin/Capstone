Abstract
The linear chromosomes of vertebrates terminate in telomeres
that consist of a tandemly repeated hexameric sequence,
5¶TTAGGG3¶. Telomeres form a protective loop structure
(t-loop), which is thought to prevent them from being recognized as a double-strand break. Approximately 10% of human
tumors prevent shortening of their telomeres by using a
recombination-mediated alternative lengthening of telomeres
(ALT) mechanism. ALT-positive human cells contain extrachromosomal telomere repeat (ECTR) DNA that may either
be circular or linear. It has been proposed that ECTR may
be generated by recombination events involving the t-loop. A
proportion of the cells within ALT-positive cell populations
contain promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies that
contain telomeric DNA and telomere-binding proteins that
are called ALT-associated PML bodies (APB). Although the
presence of APBs is very useful for determining whether
tumors and cell lines use the ALT mechanism, the function of
APBs is unknown. It has previously been shown that telomeric
DNA is particularly susceptible to damage by hydrogen
peroxide and N-methyl-N¶-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine. We report here that these DNA-damaging agents induce both linear
and circular ECTR DNA in ALT cells and increase the proportion of cells that contain APBs. We partially purified APBs
and showed that the telomeric repeat DNA they contain is
predominantly linear. We propose that a function of APBs is
to sequester linear telomeric DNA. [Cancer Res 2007;67(15):7072–7]

Introduction
Some tumors (10%) and in vitro immortalized cell lines maintain
their telomeres using the recombination-mediated alternative
lengthening of telomeres (ALT) mechanism (1). Human ALT cell
lines have a number of characteristics in common. In addition to
the lack of significant levels of telomerase activity, ALT cells have
telomeres that are highly heterogeneous in length, ranging from
very long to very short (1). This heterogeneity is generated by a
combination of gradual telomere attrition and rapid lengthening or
shortening events (2). These data suggest that ALT telomeres are
maintained by a recombination-mediated lengthening mechanism,

which was confirmed by the observation of movement of a
telomere-targeted tag onto other telomeres in an ALT cell line (3).
In contrast to telomerase-positive cells, which contain only linear
extrachromosomal telomere repeats (ECTR), ALT cells contain
both linear and circular ECTR (4, 5). ALT cells also contain unique
nuclear structures called ALT-associated promyelocytic leukemia
(PML) bodies (APB). These structures are a subset of PML bodies
that contain telomeric DNA and telomere-associated proteins (6).
Within an asynchronously dividing population of ALT cells, only
5% to 10% of the cells are APB-positive (6, 7). In addition to telomere
associated components, APBs also contain proteins involved in
recombination and repair (reviewed in ref. 8). The exact role of
APBs in the ALT mechanism, however, is still unknown.
In the following study, we found that treatment with DNAdamaging agents caused an increase in the number of cells
containing APBs. In addition to APBs, H2O2 and N-methyl-N¶-nitroN-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) caused an ALT-specific induction of
linear and circular ECTR. We analyzed an APB-enriched nuclear
fraction from H2O2-treated cells and found that APBs preferentially
associated with linear ECTR. We hypothesize that APBs may
protect the cells from DNA damage–induced signaling by
sequestering low molecular weight telomeric DNA with free ends.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and treatments. The ALT cell lines GM847 (Coriell Cell
Repositories, Camden, NJ) and JFCF/6-T.1J/1D (Dr. Paul Bonnefin, CMRI)
and the telomerase-positive cell lines HT1080 and GM639 (American Type
Culture Collection) were grown in DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and in a 5% CO2 incubator at 37jC. Treatment
of cells with H2O2 (Merck) or MNNG (Sigma) was done at f70% confluence.
Cells were exposed to 50 Amol/L H2O2 in serum-free DMEM for 45 min then
cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS for 48 h or were cultured in medium
containing 50 Amol/L MNNG for 48 h.
APB staining and analysis. Cells grown on chambered slides were
processed for detection of APBs as previously described (9). Slides were
stained with 4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) mounted in antifade
[2.33% (w/v) 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO; Sigma) in 90% glycerol/
20 mmol/L Tris (pH 8.0)] mounting media and stored at 4jC until analysis.
Slides were analyzed on a Leica DMLB epifluorescence microscope (Leica)
with appropriate filter sets, and images were taken with a cooled CCD
camera (SPOT2, Diagnostic Instruments). For demonstrative purposes,
images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop version 6.0 software.
Cells were scored as APB positive if they contained one or more large PML
bodies colocalized to telomeric DNA or at least three small PML/telomeric
DNA colocalizations (i.e., wherein the telomeric DNA component was
approximately the same size as the telomeres in that cell line). For confocal
analysis, cells were processed as described (9), except that the secondary
antibody was goat anti-rabbit IgG labeled with Alexa-633 which emits in
the far red spectrum. Cells were imaged on a Leica TCS SP2 confocal
microscope at 0.4-Am slices using the Leica Confocal Software. A single slice

containing the brightest telomere signals was overlaid on the identical slice
imaging the PML bodies using Photoshop 6.0.
Agarose plugs. Asynchronous and treated cells were collected and 3 
105 cells were resuspended in 2.0% low melt agarose. The plugs were
digested in 2.0 Ag/mL Proteinase K (Roche) overnight at 50jC, rinsed
thoroughly and equilibrated in Tris-borate EDTA (TBE). The plugs were
loaded into a 1.0% agarose gel overlaid with agarose and separated by
electrophoresis at 4 V/cm for 5 h. The gel was dried and processed to
visualize telomeric DNA as described previously (9).
APB enrichment. The isolation of an APB-enriched fraction of nuclei was
obtained by modifying a protocol described by Lam et al. (10). Sonicated
JFCF-6/T.1J/1D nuclei were resuspended in 1 mol/L sucrose and centrifuged
at 3000g for 15 min at 4jC. The supernatant was then resuspended to a
final concentration of 1 mol/L sucrose, 15.4% percoll, 10 mmol/L Tris-HCl
(pH 7.4), 0.5 mmol/L MgCl2, 1% Triton-X and centrifuged at 235,000g for
2 h at 4jC. The resulting pellet was resuspended in a final concentration of
0.5 mol/L sucrose, 15.4% percoll, 10 mmol/L PIPES, 0.5 mmol/L MgCl2,
0.5 mg/mL heparin, 0.75% Triton-X. Marker beads of 1040 g/mL (blue) and
1052 g/mL (yellow) density (Amersham Biosciences) were added to the
sample, which was centrifuged at 235,000g for 1 h at 4jC. Fractions of 1 mL
were collected, fraction 1 being above the blue beads and fraction 2 between
the blue and yellow beads. The highest number fraction represents the
pellet. Proteins were extracted by boiling the nuclear fractions in SDS,
separated on a 10% acrylamide gel and detected with mouse anti-PML
(Chemicon), 1:500, or rabbit anti-TRF2 (Dr. Lorel Colgin, CMRI) 1:1,000.
Nuclear fractions were spotted onto slides, air-dried, and processed for
APB detection as previously described (9).
Isolation and characterization of APB-associated telomeric DNA
fractions. Nuclear fractions were phenol-chloroform extracted, ethanol
precipitated, air dried, and resuspended in TE. DNA was separated by
electrophoresis in a 1.0% agarose/1 TBE (0.045mol/L Tris-borate,
0.001mol/L EDTA) gel at 10 V/cm. In gel hybridization with a probe for
telomere repeats was done as previously described (9).
Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of low molecular weight DNA
(Hirt lysate). Hirt lysate was isolated as previously described (11). Hirt
lysate (30 Ag, ALT positive or 60 Ag, telomerase positive) was separated by
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis as described by Cohen et al. (12). The

telomere-specific probe consisted of 800 bp of telomere repeats excised and
gel purified from the plasmid pTel (3). This probe was labeled by random
priming according to the DECAprime II (Ambion) manufacturer’s
instructions.

Results and Discussion
DNA damage induces both linear and circular ECTR. The
presence of circular and linear ECTR is characteristic of ALT cells.
We hypothesized that a decrease in telomere length due to DNA
damage (13, 14) would be reflected by an increase in ECTR. We
embedded asynchronously growing and H2O2-treated or MNNGtreated GM847 (ALT positive) and GM639 (telomerase positive)
cells in agarose, subjected them to electrophoresis in a 1.0%
agarose gel, and probed for telomeric DNA (Fig. 1A). The GM847
cells showed a significant increase in the amount of ECTR after the
treatments (Fig. 1B), whereas GM639 did not (Fig. 1A and B).
We determined the structure of this ECTR by two-dimensional
gel electrophoresis. We speculated that the increase in ECTR might
reflect an increase in circular ECTR, correlating with cleavage of
the t-loop (5). Asynchronously growing GM847 and JFCF/6-T.1J/1D
(also ALT positive) cells had a similar intensity of the arcs corresponding to linear and circular DNA (Fig. 2A). This observation was
confirmed by densitometric analysis that indicated a ratio of linear
to circular ECTR in asynchronous GM847 and JFCF/6-T.1J/1D of
f1 (Fig. 2B). Surprisingly, we found a similar pattern (Fig. 2A) and
ratio (Fig. 2B) for H2O2-treated cells, suggesting that there was an
increase in both linear and circular ECTR after telomeric DNA
damage. Treatment of GM847 cells with MNNG resulted in a
similar pattern and ratio as H2O2 treatment (data not shown).
There was no increase in linear ECTR in H2O2-treated and MNNGtreated GM639 and no circular ECTR were seen (data not shown).
It is likely that the origin of the linear ECTR is the telomere ends.
The DNA in the arc corresponding to circular ECTR could arise

either from double-strand breaks that cleave off t-loops with stems
of various lengths or from recombination resolution events that
result in the t-loops themselves being converted to free circles (4);
the latter would suggest that telomere-specific DNA damage
stimulates ALT activity.
DNA damage induces APBs. Previous work by our group and
others (15) has shown that only f5% to 10% of exponentially
growing ALT cells contain APBs, defined as PML bodies colocalizing
with aggregates of telomeric DNA or telomere-binding proteins
that are unambiguously larger than the telomeres within the same
cell (6). These APBs can usually be detected with a 10 objective
and often have the ‘‘donut’’ morphology characteristic of large PML
bodies (Fig. 3A). Combined telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and indirect immunofluorescence also identifies smaller,
telomere-sized foci that colocalize with smaller PML bodies and
require a 40 or 100 objective for visualization (Fig. 3A), and these
are present in a larger proportion of cells within ALT populations
(Fig. 3B). These APBs were further analyzed by confocal microscopy
to confirm colocalization of the telomere-sized foci with small
PML bodies seen by conventional microscopy (data not shown).
It has previously been shown that telomeres become shortened
after exposure to DNA-damaging agents, such as H2O2 or MNNG
(13, 14). We hypothesized that telomere shortening might be
accompanied by an increase in ECTR DNA and that this might
result in an increase in APB-positive cells. After treatment of
GM847 and JFCF/6-T.1J/1D cells with either 50 Amol/L H2O2 or
50 Amol/L MNNG, there was a substantial increase in the number
of cells containing APBs. In untreated populations of asynchronous GM847 cells, the proportion of cells containing large APBs
was 11.7%, and 52.1% contained small APBs. This increased to
32.3% positive for large APBs and 83.5% for small APBs after H2O2

treatment, and JFCF/6-T.1J/1D increased from 21.5% (large)/64.7%
(small) untreated to 33.9%/86.6% after H2O2 (Fig. 3B). Similarly,
MNNG treatment of GM847 and JFCF/6-T.1J/1D cells increased
the proportion of APB-positive cells to 26.5%/75.0% and to 60.3%/
84.6%, respectively (Fig. 3B). Seven additional ALT cell lines have
also shown induction of APBs by H2O2 treatment (data not
shown), suggesting that this mechanism is common to APB
formation and not specific for a particular cell line. No APBs of
any size were detected in the telomerase-positive cell line, GM639,
in asynchronous populations or after H2O2 or MNNG treatment
(Fig. 3A and B). In contrast, induction of DNA damage by UV
light, hydroxyurea, or double thymidine block did not increase the
number of APB-positive ALT cells (data not shown). These data
show that ALT cells, when exposed to specific DNA damaging
agents, have a striking propensity to increase the proportion of
APB-positive cells. This ability to induce APBs has provided us
with a method of further investigating the relationship of APBs to
the ALT mechanism.
APB-associated telomeric DNA is predominantly linear.
Because H2O2 induces both linear and circular ECTR, we wanted
to determine the structure of APB-associated telomere repeats. We
first adapted a method for purifying APBs from a protocol used to
isolate Cajal bodies (10) using a series of sucrose gradients. The
resulting fractions were analyzed for APBs and the APB-associated
proteins TRF2 and PML. The majority of intact APBs could be
visualized in fraction 2 by indirect immunofluorescence of the PML
protein combined with FISH using a telomere-specific peptide
nucleic acid probe (Fig. 4A, top). The enrichment of the APBs in
fraction 2 corresponded with the enrichment of the telomerebinding protein, TRF2, and PML, as detected by Western blot
analysis (Fig. 4A, bottom). Although TRF2 was found in fraction 6,

which represents the pellet after fractionation, PML was absent and
no APBs were visualized (data not shown; Fig. 4A, bottom).
From these fractions, we were able to extract the APB-associated
DNA and analyze it for telomeric content as well as structure. We
first ran a single-dimension gel and stained it with ethidium
bromide (Fig. 4B, top). The majority of high molecular weight DNA
was contained in fractions 1a, 1b, and 1c. The amount of DNA
decreased steadily from fractions 2 through 6 (Fig. 4B, top). Probing
this gel with a telomere-specific oligo probe revealed an
enrichment of telomeric DNA in fraction 2 (Fig. 4B, bottom).
Therefore, fraction 2 does not only contain most of the APBs
(which contain the bulk of the telomeric DNA detectable by FISH
staining) but also contains the majority of the telomeric DNA
detectable by Southern blotting.
We analyzed fractions 2 and 6 by two-dimensional agarose gel
electrophoresis. Fraction 2 contained a strong linear arc with a
distinct, but less intense, circular arc (Fig. 4C, left). The relative
intensities of the APB-associated arcs in fraction 2 indicate a
correlation between APBs and linear extrachromosomal telomeric
DNA (Fig. 4C, right) compared with the asynchronous and H2O2-

treated parental JFCF/6-T.1J/1D. To positively identify the lower arc
as linear DNA, we analyzed comigration of fraction 2 ECTR and 500
ng of linear marker DNA Spp-1 by two-dimensional agarose gel
electrophoresis. We first identified the fraction 2 linear ECTR DNA
using a telomere-specific probe (Fig. 4D). After stripping and
reprobing for the Spp-1 ladder (Fig. 4D), we merged the fraction 2
image with the marker image and found that the arcs comigrated.
Fraction 6 contained a single arc with the majority of DNA having a
low molecular weight and high mobility structure (data not
shown). As no APBs could be visualized by immunofluorescence
microscopy of fraction 6, its associated telomeric DNA most likely
represents a population of DNA sheared from the telomeres during
the Hirt lysate extraction. Taken together, these data show that
APBs associate primarily with linear telomere repeats in H2O2treated cells. We therefore suggest that a function of APBs is to
sequester linear telomeric DNA.
We have found that APBs and ECTR can be induced by DNAdamaging agents. The H2O2-induced APBs associate preferentially
with linear ECTR. These data suggest a model in which linear ECTR
may be recognized by the cell as a double-strand break or as an

Figure 4. Fraction 2 contains APBs
that predominantly associate with linear
ECTR. A, colocalization of PML (green )
and telomeric DNA (red ) indicated the
presence of APBs in one of the JFCF-6/
T.1J/1D nuclear fractions. The enrichment
for APBs in fraction 2 was corroborated by
the presence of PML and TRF2, also found
in fraction 6, by Western blot analysis.
B, most of the genomic DNA was found in
the first two fractions (1a and 1b) when

APB-enriched fraction 2. C, twodimensional gel electrophoresis indicated
a significant amount of linear ECTR
compared with circular ECTR in fraction 2.
The predominance of linear ECTR DNA in
fraction 2 was confirmed by densitometric
analyses of the arc intensity ratios. D, to
confirm the structure of the major arc in
fraction 2, a linear marker, Spp-1, was
separated with fraction 2 DNA by
two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.

intermediate product in double-strand break repair. The small
APBs may represent ‘‘new’’ sites of linear ECTR production
resulting from rapid telomere deletion. Alternatively, they might
be providing ECTR to telomeres for lengthening events. Circular
ECTR DNA, which does not have free ends, presumably does not
elicit the same response and mostly remains elsewhere in the
nucleoplasm but could also participate in ALT activity, for example,
by a rolling circle mechanism.
Several groups have reported the movement of PML bodies
(16, 17). One group characterized the movements of telomeres
in U-2 OS, an ALT cell line, and found transient associations of
telomere-sized foci with larger telomeric aggregates (18).
Although this group did not correlate PML with these larger
telomere ‘‘clusters,’’ they most likely correspond to the large
APBs. It is possible that the cell localizes the ECTR to a large
APB either actively involved in homologous recombination or

the repair process. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
forms a large repair focus, which is likened to a recombination
center (19); multiple recombination/repair events occur within
this one focus. It is possible that the large APBs represent a
similar phenomenon.
