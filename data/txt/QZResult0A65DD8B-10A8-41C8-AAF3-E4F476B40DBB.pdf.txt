Abstract
Inflammatory mediators present in the tumor milieu may promote cancer progression and are considered promising targets of novel biological therapies. We previously reported that the marine antitumor
agent trabectedin, approved in Europe in 2007 for soft tissue sarcomas and in 2009 for ovarian cancer,
was able to downmodulate the production of selected cytokines/chemokines in immune cells. Patients with
myxoid liposarcoma (MLS), a subtype characterized by the expression of the oncogenic transcript FUSCHOP, are highly responsive to trabectedin. The drug had marked antiproliferative effects on MLS cell lines
at low nanomolar concentrations. We tested the hypothesis that trabectedin could also affect the inflammatory mediators produced by cancer cells. Here, we show that MLS express several cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, CXCL12, MIF, VEGF, SPARC) and the
inflammatory and matrix-binder protein pentraxin 3 (PTX3), which build up a prominent inflammatory
environment. In vitro treatment with noncytotoxic concentrations of trabectedin selectively inhibited the
production of CCL2, CXCL8, IL-6, VEGF, and PTX3 by MLS primary tumor cultures and/or cell lines. A
xenograft mouse model of human MLS showed marked reduction of CCL2, CXCL8, CD68+ infiltrating
macrophages, CD31+ tumor vessels, and partial decrease of PTX3 after trabectedin treatment. Similar findings were observed in a patient tumor sample excised after several cycles of therapy, indicating that the
results observed in vitro might have in vivo relevance. In conclusion, trabectedin has dual effects in liposarcoma: in addition to direct growth inhibition, it affects the tumor microenvironment by reducing the
production of key inflammatory mediators. Cancer Res; 70(6); 2235–44. ©2010 AACR.

Introduction
Trabectedin (ET-743; Yondelis) is the first marine-derived
anticancer drug that has reached the market. It was approved in Europe in 2007 for second line treatment of soft
tissue sarcomas and in 2009 for relapsed ovarian cancer in
combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin. Studies
are in progress to ascertain its efficacy in other neoplastic

diseases, including breast and prostate cancer, as suggested
by the early clinical trials. Originally derived from the marine tunicate Ecteinascidia turbinata, it is now obtained by
a semisynthetic method starting from cyanosaframycin B,
an antibiotic that can be produced in large quantities by
fermentation of Pseudomonas fluorescens (1). Trabectedin is
a DNA-binding agent interfering with gene transcription,
regulation, and DNA repair machinery (2, 3), and is able
to induce cell cycle perturbation with a delayed S phase
progression and accumulation of cells in G2 phase (4). Its
mechanism of action is incompletely understood and presents some unique features. Unlike most conventional antitumor agents, it binds the minor groove of DNA at the N2
position of guanines, bending the DNA sharply towards the
major groove (3, 5, 6); its cytotoxicity seems to be dependent on the efficiency of transcription-coupled nucleotide
excision repair, a deficiency of which makes cells less sensitive to the drug; instead, cells carrying defects of homologous recombination repair, e.g., for BRCA gene mutations,
are especially sensitive (7–9).
A distinct histologic subtype of soft tissue sarcoma is the
myxoid liposarcoma (MLS) which is particularly susceptible
to trabectedin (10–12). Second line treatment in patients
with MLS was reported to be exceptionally effective with

long-lasting responses higher than 50% and ∼20% of pathologic complete responses (10). Most MLS carry the fusion
gene FUS-CHOP, caused by the t(12:16) chromosome translocation, considered the pathogenetic lesion of this tumor (13–
15). FUS encodes an RNA and DNA binding protein. CHOP is
a stress-induced transcription factor forming DNA binding
dimers with CAAT/enhancer binding proteins, acting as a
negative regulator. Members of the CAAT/enhancer binding
protein family have major roles in adipogenesis and their
function can be subverted by FUS-CHOP, with a consequent
block in adipogenesis differentiation. The oncogenic potential of the transcript has been proven in FUS-CHOP transgenic animals which develop liposarcoma and in transformed
mesenchymal progenitors (16, 17). The high susceptibility
of MLS raised the question of whether FUS-CHOP is a target
of trabectedin. A study conducted on MLS cells showed
that trabectedin does not affect the transcription of the
FUS-CHOP chimera, but blocks its transactivating ability by
inducing the detachment of FUS-CHOP protein from the promoters of target genes (18).
In patients with MLS undergoing trabectedin therapy, it is
not infrequent to observe clinical responses after several cycles of chemotherapy, unlike what happens with most cytotoxic drugs. In addition, radioimaging (magnetic resonance
imaging and computed tomography scans) show that clinical
responses are associated with a decrease in tumor density
that precedes tumor shrinkage (10, 19). It is therefore suspected that trabectedin plays biological effects on the tumor
microenvironment other than direct cytotoxicity to cancer
cells.
On the basis of our previous findings that trabectedin
reduces the production of some cytokines/chemokines in
immune cells (20), we postulated the hypothesis that a reduction of inflammatory mediators at the tumor site might
contribute to its antitumor efficacy. It is now established
that a persistent cancer-related inflammation promotes tumor cell proliferation, survival, and spread (21–23). Genetic
events causing neoplasia actively support the construction
of an inflammatory milieu. Examples of oncogene-driven
activation of the inflammatory cascade include the oncogene RET in thyroid papillary carcinoma, and RAS, BRAF,
or mutated tumor suppressor genes in different tumors
(22, 24, 25). Little is known about the downstream target
genes activated by the oncogenic transcript FUS-CHOP,
particularly inflammatory genes, with the exception of IL-6,
and recently, IL-8 (26, 27).
In this work, we investigated the spectrum of inflammatory mediators present in the microenvironment of MLS
and the effect of trabectedin treatment in vitro and in vivo.
We show that MLS cancer cells build up a prominent inflammatory microenvironment. Trabectedin significantly reduced the expression and production of CCL2, CXCL8, IL-6,
VEGF, and the proinflammatory protein and matrix binder
pentraxin 3 (PTX3). Mice transplanted with human MLS
showed lower infiltration of CD68 macrophages and lower
numbers of vessels after therapy. This anti-inflammatory effect of trabectedin might contribute to its antitumor efficacy in MLS.

Materials and Methods
Drug. Trabectedin (PharmaMar, Spain) was dissolved in
DMSO to 1 mmol/L, and kept at −20°C.
MLS cell lines. MLS cell lines, 402.91 and 1765, the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and its subline transfected with
FUS-CHOP, were kindly provided by Dr. Pierre Aman (University of Gothenburg, Sweden). Cells were grown in RPMI
1640 with 10% FCS (Lonza), Ultraglutamine 1 200 mmol/L
(Lonza), and Pen/Strep. The liposarcoma cell line SW872,
lacking FUS-CHOP (kindly provided by Prof. Bussolati, University of Parma, Parma, Italy), was grown in complete
DMEM + 10% FCS. Tumor cell lines were routinely verified
by morphology, growth curve analysis, and tested for Mycoplasma. Primary cultures of human MLS were obtained
from surgical specimens. Tumors were minced and enzymatically digested with 500 units/mL of collagenase II
and 2 units/mL of DNase for 1 h at 37°C. Cell suspension
was filtered and the cells were seeded in ISCOV-1 medium
+ 10% FCS, L-glutamine 200 mmol/L, and Pen/Strep.
Establishment of MLS xenografts. Fragments of human
MLS tumor biopsies were established as xenografts
through serial transplantation in nude mice for a limited
number of passages. The presence of fusion transcript type
corresponding to the original tumors was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis at each passage. Mice
were treated with trabectedin (0.15 mg/kg, q7dx3) starting
when tumors were palpable. Tumors for immunohistochemistry (n = 3) were excised 48 h after the third dose.
Five to seven sections were analyzed from each tumor.
Cell cycle analysis, growth inhibition, cytotoxic effect,
and apoptosis. Exponentially growing cells were treated
for 1 h, or as specified, with different concentrations of
trabectedin, then washed with PBS and fresh drug-free medium was added. The growth-inhibitory effect of trabectedin was evaluated at different times after drug washout.
The effect of trabectedin on clonogenicity was evaluated
as previously described (28). Cell cycle analysis was performed by flow cytometry on cells fixed in 70% cold ethanol and kept at 4°C before DNA staining. To detect
bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) incorporated into DNA, fixed
cells were incubated with anti-BrdUrd monoclonal antibody (Becton Dickinson) and DNA detected by propidium
iodide (4). To analyze apoptotic death after trabectedin
treatment, mRNA levels were tested with TaqMan Human
Apoptosis Array (Applied Biosystems), following the
instructions of the manufacturer.
Measurement of inflammatory mediators. Tumor cell
lines were starved (without FCS) for 18 h and treated with
different doses of trabectedin for 4 h. Cells were washed
and stimulated or not with tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα;
20 ng/mL). Total RNA extraction was done with Trizol. cDNA
was synthesized by random priming from 1 μg of total RNA
with GeneAmp RNA PCR kit (Applied Biosystems). mRNA levels of 91 genes related to inflammation were tested with
custom TaqMan Human Inflammation Array (Applied Biosystems). Real-time PCR was performed using SYBR Green
dye. Sequences of specific primer pairs (Invitrogen) were

For each gene, mRNA was normalized to β-actin mRNA
(ΔCt). Results are shown as arbitrary units (2−ΔCt × 10,000).
Fold change (2−ΔΔCt) of trabectedin-treated cells is calculated compared with the untreated cells.
Protein levels were measured by ELISA in cell supernatants collected at 24 h culture after drug treatment (4 h)
and washout. Under these conditions, cell viability was
checked and was usually >87% for all drug concentrations
shown. IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, CCL2, CXCL8, TNFα, and VEGF
were determined by the BioPlex Protein Array Luminex 100

System (Bio-Rad). Data acquisition and analysis were done
using BioPlex Manager software. PTX3 detection was measured by ELISA as previously described (29).
Immunohistochemistry. Antibodies used for immunohistochemistry of surgical MLS specimens were antihuman
CD31 (clone JC70A; Dako), antimouse CD31 (clone MEC13.3;
PharMingen), antimurine CD68 (clone FA-11; HyCult Biotechnology), antihuman CD68 (clone KP1; Dako), antihuman CCL2
(clone 5D3-F7; Alexis Biochemicals), antihuman CXCL8 (clone
6217; R&D Systems), antihuman PTX3 (polyclonal), and antimurine PTX3 (clone MNB1; Alexis Biochemicals).
Patients with MLS. Eighteen patients were admitted at
the National Cancer Institute (Milan Italy) with persistent
disease after standard chemotherapy and were eligible to trabectedin. In all patients, the diagnosis of MLS was confirmed
by histology and cytogenetic analyses (presence of FUSCHOP transcript). Blood samples were collected immediately

Results
Trabectedin induces cell cycle perturbation in MLS
cells and triggers cell death. We first investigated the direct

effects of trabectedin on human MLS. A short 1-hour exposure affected the proliferation of the cell line 402.91. Figure
1A (top right) shows the results of a representative clonogenic experiment: a strong dose-dependent effect was observed with 50% reduction at concentration of 1.5 nmol/L.
Cell cycle analysis, performed at different time intervals after
drug treatment, showed that trabectedin induced a block of
cell proliferation and a dose-dependent accumulation of cells
in S phase (5 and 10 nmol/L), followed by a G2-M block
(Fig. 1A, left). A strong growth inhibition consequent to G2M block is depicted in Fig. 1A (bottom right). Biparametric

Trabectedin Reduces Cancer-Related Inflammation

flow cytometric BrdUrd/DNA analysis showed that at 24
hours after drug treatment (1 hour) and washout, both
BrdUrd-positive (i.e., cells in S phase during drug treatment)
as well as BrdUrd-negative (i.e., cells in G1 or G2-M phase
during drug treatment) accumulated in G 2 -M phases
(Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed with primary cultures
obtained from a MLS surgical specimen (Fig. 1C). Prolonged
drug exposure to trabectedin induced a cytotoxic effect in
402.91 and 1765 cell lines; after 48 hours of continuous exposure to 2.5 nmol/L, cell death was 70% and 50%, respectively.
At 24 hours, it was <20% at 5 nmol/L (data not shown). The
majority of cells were in necrosis but a proportion of Annexin V+ PI− cells (22%) was also detected; as shown in Fig. 1D
(bottom), some apoptosis genes were upregulated at 18 hours:
BIK, FAS, TRAILR1 (DR4), and caspase 10. Overall, the results
show that MLS cells are highly susceptible to trabectedin
within the low nanomolar range.
MLS cells express inflammatory mediators and build up
an inflammatory microenvironment. As little is known
about the presence of an inflammatory microenvironment in
human MLS, we first explored a wide panel of biological mediators with a customized TaqMan Inflammation Array. mRNA
was obtained from (a) frozen sections of two distinct human
MLS surgical samples; (b) the MLS cell lines 402.91 and 1765;

(c) the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and its FUS-CHOP–
transduced variant. Table 1 shows that several inflammatory
mediators were highly expressed in the tumor milieu of the
two surgical MLS samples. For instance, chemokines (CCL2,
CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8,CXCL12, CXCR4), cytokines and growth
factors (TNF and receptors, IL-1β, M-CSF, MIF, TGFβ,VEGF,
and angiopoietin 1), and matrix-binding proteins (PTX3 and
SPARC). PTX3, originally described by our group, is an inflammatory protein acting as a soluble pattern recognition receptor and is also involved in the organization of the extracellular
matrix (ECM; refs. 29, 30). In addition, molecules related to infiltrating myeloid cells (CD68, CD14, M-CSFR; Supplementary
Fig. S1) were highly expressed. Some inflammatory mediators
were also elevated in the cell lines 402.91 and 1765: CCL2,
CCL5, CXCL8, PTX3, SPARC, M-CSF, and MIF. The FUSCHOP–transfected HT1080 cell line was tested to investigate
the inflammation-related genes activated downstream of the
oncogenic transcript distinctive of MLS. HT1080-FUS-CHOP
cells expressed higher levels of CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, MIF,
PTX3, TGFβ, and VEGF compared with HT1080 cells, indicating that the transactivating ability of FUS-CHOP indeed involves genes of the inflammatory response.
Selected factors were confirmed by immunohistochemistry
in surgical tumor specimens as well as in MLS xenografts

representative experiment (four to eight experiments performed). B, CCL2, CXCL8, IL-6, VEGF, and PTX3 protein levels in primary MLS cultures measured

cultures for PTX3). Trabectedin: 5 nmol/L (black columns), 10 nmol/L (gray column). *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01 (Student's t test).

established in nude mice from patient tumor samples. Genetic analysis of xenografted MLS confirmed that growing tumors retained the original fusion transcript type (data not
shown). Staining for CXCL8, CCL2, PTX3, and for macrophage
infiltration (CD68) and vessels (CD31) are shown in Fig. 2.
Both samples from patient tumors (A) and xenograft tumors
(B) have a florid angiogenesis, a remarkable macrophage content, and tumor cells producing CXCL8 and CCL2. The whole
sections stained strongly for PTX3, which was secreted by
cancer cells (insets). To further control PTX3 origin in xenograft tumors, an antimurine PTX3 was used. Supplementary
Fig. S2 shows that tumor cells were negative, only few scattered stromal cells were positive.
Overall, the results highlight that human MLS build up a
prominent inflammatory microenvironment. We next determined the effect of trabectedin on this inflammatory network.
Trabectedin inhibits the production of selected inflammatory mediators in vitro. In vitro treatment of the two
cell lines (402.91 and 1765) with trabectedin reduced
mRNA levels of selected mediators: CCL5, CXCL8, IL1β in
1765 cells, and CCL2 and PTX3 in both cell lines (Table 1).
Other expressed genes (TGFβ, TNFRII, M-CSF, MIF, and
SPARC) were unaffected, ruling out the occurrence of a nonspecific cytotoxic effect. In HT1080-FUS-CHOP cells, trabectedin strongly reduced the expression of CCL2, CXCL8, as
well as PTX3 (Table 1). Selected mediators were corroborated by real-time PCR in untreated and TNF-stimulated

402.91 and 1765 cells. Inhibition of CCL2, CXCL8, and
PTX3 was confirmed after trabectedin treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3)
Determination of protein levels was performed by ELISA in
cell supernatants. In the absence of exogenous stimuli, considerable levels of CCL2, CXCL8, and especially of PTX3, were
secreted by both cell lines. Lower levels of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6,
IL-10, and VEGF were also detected (Supplementary Fig. S4).
To assess the inhibitory effect of trabectedin, cell supernatants were collected after 24 hours of drug treatment
(4 hours) and washout. Under these conditions, cell viability
was usually >87% for all drug concentrations shown. Both
constitutive and TNF-induced production of all three inflammatory mediators was dose-dependently reduced,
with a more dramatic effect in TNF-induced production.
Figure 3A shows representative experiments. Mean inhibition
of CCL2 was 61.2% and 64.6% at 2.5 nmol/L of trabectedin
for 402.91 (n = 8 experiments) and 1765 (n = 6), respectively; at 5 nmol/L, a complete block of CCL2 production
was observed (>88% for both cell lines). CXCL8 levels were also reduced with 64.9% and 38.8% inhibition at 5 nmol/L
(402.91 and 1765, respectively; n = 4). For PTX3, reduction
was higher in 402.91 cells (60.5% at 2.5 nmol/L and 79.6% at
5 nmol/L) compared with 1765 cells (39.6% at 2.5 nmol/L and
50% at 5 nmol/L; n = 6). Cell-associated PTX3 was tested by
Western blot in 402.91 cells and was also downmodulated by
50% (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Trabectedin Reduces Cancer-Related Inflammation

We next investigated cytokine/chemokine and PTX3 production by primary tumor cultures derived from surgical
MLS samples. As observed with the cell lines, primary MLS
cultures constitutively produced CCL2, CXCL8, IL-6, VEGF,
and high levels of PTX3 (Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 3B
shows that CCL2 and CXCL8 were reduced by trabectedin
with variable levels of inhibition. The mean decrease of
CCL2 was 50.82% (range, 29.4–64.8%), whereas CXCL8 decreased by 48.7% (range, 38.4–68.2%). IL-6 and VEGF were
also significantly downmodulated, the mean inhibition of
IL-6 was 52% (range, 38.8–72.4%), whereas VEGF was at
40.2% (range, 23.1–50.5%) in three out of four cultures.
PTX3 was also reduced, with a mean inhibition of 44.1%
(range, 13.3–70%). Culture no. 3 secreted very high levels of
PTX3 and a decrease was evident only at 10 nmol/L.
Of interest, in parallel experiments, we noticed that PTX3
levels (mRNA and protein) were not decreased in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes. We therefore tested other
PTX3-producing cells. TNF-stimulated human umbilical vascular endothelial cell and a liposarcoma cell line (SW872) not
harboring the FUS-CHOP transcript were not inhibited in
their PTX3 production (Supplementary Fig. S6), indicating
that trabectedin inhibits PTX3 only in FUS-CHOP–positive
cells. Overall, a brief exposure to trabectedin significantly reduced the production of key inflammatory mediators by MLS
cell lines and primary cultures.
Trabectedin reduces the inflammatory microenvironment in vivo. To investigate whether a reduction of inflam-

matory mediators also occurs in vivo, mice bearing xenograft
tumors were treated with three doses of i.v. trabectedin; tumor samples were excised 48 hours after the third dose and
stained for CXCL8, CCL2, PTX3, macrophage infiltration, and
vessels. Pictures from untreated (Fig. 4A) and trabectedintreated animals (Fig. 4B) are shown. The number of CD68+
infiltrating macrophages significantly decreased after trabectedin from 72.4 ±8 (mean ± SD, three tumors) to 30.2 ± 6
(n = 3; P < 0.05). Tumor vessels were also strongly reduced,
from 40.5 ± 7(n = 3) to 10.2 ± 5 (n = 3; P < 0.05) in untreated and treated animals, respectively. A clear inhibition
of CXCL8 and CCL2 staining and a partial reduction of
PTX3 were observed after treatment.
We had the opportunity to test surgical MLS patient samples resected after several cycles of trabectedin therapy, from
whom the original bioptic tissue was available. Figure 5A
shows tissues from a patient with clinical response to trabectedin. The surgical sample excised after therapy had a
marked decrease in CD31+ vessels and CD68+ macrophages;
PTX3 positivity was also strongly decreased compared with
the sample before therapy (Fig. 5A). These findings indicate that the reduction of inflammatory mediators observed
in vitro with trabectedin may have in vivo relevance.
Our group tested the potential diagnostic and prognostic
value of plasma PTX3 levels in different pathologies, including infectious, cardiovascular, and autoimmune diseases (29,
30). As MLS cancer cells are potent producers of PTX3, it was
of interest to investigate the circulating levels of PTX3 in

these patients. Figure 5B shows that median plasma levels of
PTX3 were significantly higher (11,540 pg/mL) compared
with those of healthy donors (2,000 pg/mL) or of cancer patients with other malignancies (colorectal and liver cancer).
Of 11 patients undergoing therapy with trabectedin, it was
possible to follow the plasma levels of PTX3 in seven cases.
A decrease of circulating PTX3 was observed in four patients
experiencing a measurable clinical response according to the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (ref. 10; Fig. 5C).
In three other patients (two with low levels of plasma
PTX3), no modification was observed in spite of one partial
response, one stable disease, and a mixed response. Thus,
plasma PTX3 levels in patients with MLS are considerably
elevated; the significance of high PTX3 levels and its validity
as a biomarker of response to therapy in these patients
needs to be further investigated.

Discussion
In this study, we have evaluated multiple effects of trabectedin on MLS cell lines, primary tumor cultures, and MLS xenografts as a direct antiproliferative effect and for the
reduction of selected proinflammatory mediators. In MLS
cells, this compound induces a marked growth inhibition

due to a delay in S phase and a G2-M block and, in a fraction
of cells, subsequent activation of apoptosis. Inhibition of proliferation in vitro was observed at very low concentrations (1–
3 nmol/L) and short exposure times (1 hour), that are realistically achievable according to pharmacokinetic data (19). Indeed, trabectedin showed high efficacy in advanced MLS (10).
This liposarcoma subtype is characterized by the presence of
the oncogenic fusion transcript FUS-CHOP (16, 17). Whether
FUS-CHOP is a target of trabectedin is an open issue. Several
tumor types which do not express FUS-CHOP are susceptible
to the drug (e.g., other sarcomas, breast and ovarian carcinoma). Recent studies indicate that trabectedin has no effect on
the transcription of FUS-CHOP gene, but blocks its transactivating ability causing the detachment of the FUS-CHOP protein from the promoter of target genes (18).
The mechanism of action of this compound is not limited to binding and damage of DNA but also includes the
transcriptional inhibition of selected genes (2). We previously showed that trabectedin reduces the production of
CCL2 and IL-6 in activated macrophages (20). These and
other mediators of the inflammatory response are frequently expressed in the tumor microenvironment by infiltrating leukocytes, stromal and cancer cells themselves
(21–23). It is generally considered that the presence of a

Trabectedin Reduces Cancer-Related Inflammation

smoldering inflammation in neoplastic tissues promotes
tumor cell survival and proliferation, as well as the maintenance of a reactive stroma with neoangiogenesis and
matrix turnover (21–23). Here, we show that MLS cells
produce in vitro and in vivo several cytokines, chemokines,
and growth factors, and that the oncogenic transcript FUSCHOP is involved in the activation of the inflammatory
cascade. Trabectedin significantly reduced CCL2, CXCL8,
as well as IL-6 and VEGF in MLS cells and xenografts. Reduction of these key inflammatory mediators may represent an important mechanism of its antitumor efficacy.
CCL2 is a major chemokine promoting monocyte
recruitment at sites of inflammation and tumors, and its expression significantly correlates with macrophage accumulation (31, 32). In most studies, CCL2-mediated attraction of
macrophages is associated with the angiogenic switch and
poor prognosis (22, 33–36). The chemokine CXCL8 is a potent
mediator of angiogenesis enhancing endothelial cell proliferation, chemotaxis, survival, and protease activation (32, 37).
Moreover, CXCL8 is directly mitogenic for some cancer cells
and plays a critical role in tumor growth at metastatic sites
(32, 37–39). In xenograft-bearing mice treated with trabectedin therapy, the reduced expression of CCL2 and CXCL8 was
paralleled by a marked decrease in the number of infiltrating
macrophages and vessels. In primary MLS cultures, IL-6 and
VEGF were also downmodulated by trabectedin. VEGF is a
key angiogenic factor, which certainly cooperates with the
florid vessel network of MLS. IL-6 is a growth-promoting
and antiapoptotic inflammatory cytokine (21, 40–43) and a
major effector signal of activated nuclear factor κB in the promotion of neoplasia (44, 45).
In a previous collaborative study, we reported that PTX3
was one of the most expressed genes in MLS (46). We found
that trabectedin caused a marked downmodulation of PTX3
mRNA and protein. PTX3 belongs to the family of acute phase
proteins (which also includes CRP and SAP) and plays an important role in innate resistance to pathogens (30). In addition, PTX3 has been shown to be essential for the
construction of the ECM by forming complexes with the
TNF-regulated protein TSG6 which, in turn, combines with
hyaluronan (47). In the tumor microenvironment, the constitution of a dynamic stroma is of overriding importance for the
enlarging tumor mass. Our data also show that trabectedin
affects the transcription and production of PTX3 only in the
presence of the FUS-CHOP transcript. No inhibition was observed in a FUS/CHOP-negative liposarcoma cell line, nor in
monocytes and endothelial cells. Forni and colleagues recently observed by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments

that the FUS-CHOP transcript is bound to the PTX3 promoter
in the 402.91 cell line, providing a possible mechanistic explanation for this selectivity (18). Immature adipocytes produce
PTX3 in response to TNF and IL-1, and PTX3 mRNA is reduced during terminal differentiation by long-chain fatty
acids (48). Thus, PTX3 is transiently expressed during normal
adipocyte differentiation (48) and the high levels in MLS may
reflect a “frozen” undifferentiated state.
Whether a decrease in PTX3 levels is relevant for the antitumor activity of trabectedin in MLS is unknown. We attempted to study in vitro the effect of PTX3 on MLS cell
lines 402.91 and 1765. PTX3 inhibition with blocking antibodies, or its silencing in 402.91 cells with short interfering RNA
did not significantly impair tumor proliferation, nor susceptibility to trabectedin (data not shown). More in general, the
role of PTX3 in cancer in unclear and its involvement, particularly in MLS biology, deserves further investigation. Of note,
MLS cell lines also expressed high levels of SPARC, another
matricellular protein that has been investigated in several tumor types (49, 50). Unlike PTX3, SPARC was not modulated
by treatment with trabectedin.
In conclusion, we have examined the possible mechanisms of action of trabectedin in human MLS. Beyond a direct and strong growth-inhibitory effect on cancer cells, this
drug significantly hampered the production of selected
proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, CCL2, CXCL8,
VEGF, and PTX3. The inhibition of some mediators was
confirmed in vivo in animals bearing MLS xenografts, paralleled by a marked decrease of infiltrating macrophages and
tumor vessels. Downregulation of key inflammatory molecules in the tumor microenvironment might be of benefit
in light of the increasingly clear relationship between persistent inflammation and cancer progression.
