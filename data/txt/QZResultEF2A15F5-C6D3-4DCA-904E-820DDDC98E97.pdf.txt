Abstract

Introduction

Tubulin-binding vascular-disrupting agents (VDA) are currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy but the factors
that influence tumor susceptibility to these agents are poorly
understood. We evaluated the consequences of modifying
tumor vascular morphology and function on vascular and
therapeutic response to combretastatin-A4 3-O-phosphate
(CA-4-P), which was chosen as a model VDA. Mouse fibrosarcoma cell lines that are capable of expressing all vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) isoforms (control) or only
single isoforms of VEGF (VEGF120, VEGF164, or VEGF188)
were developed under endogenous VEGF promoter control.
Once tumors were established, VEGF isoform expression did
not affect growth or blood flow rate. However, VEGF188 was
uniquely associated with tumor vascular maturity, resistance
to hemorrhage, and resistance to CA-4-P. Pericyte staining
was much greater in VEGF188 and control tumors than in
VEGF120 and VEGF164 tumors. Vascular volume was highest
in VEGF120 and control tumors (CD31 staining) but total vascular length was highest in VEGF188 tumors, reflecting very
narrow vessels forming complex vascular networks. I.v.
administered 40 kDa FITC-dextran leaked slowly from the
vasculature of VEGF188 tumors compared with VEGF120
tumors. Intravital microscopy measurements of vascular
length and RBC velocity showed that CA-4-P produced significantly more vascular damage in VEGF120 and VEGF164
tumors than in VEGF188 and control tumors. Importantly,
this translated into a similar differential in therapeutic
response, as determined by tumor growth delay. Results imply
differences in signaling pathways between VEGF isoforms
and suggest that VEGF isoforms might be useful in vasculardisrupting cancer therapy to predict tumor susceptibility to
VDAs. [Cancer Res 2008;68(7):2301–11]

Disodium combretastatin-A4 3-O-phosphate (CA-4-P) is the
lead compound of a group of tubulin-binding agents that act as
vascular-disrupting agents (VDA) in solid tumors (1, 2). CA-4-P is
active in human cancers (3) and is currently in phase II clinical
trials in combination with conventional treatments (4).4 VDAs
cause a catastrophic collapse of blood flow to solid tumors and
thus form a conceptually distinct group from the antiangiogenic
agents (5).
Despite the progress of VDAs to clinical trials, and some
evidence for improved patient survival upon adding VDA
treatment to conventional chemotherapy (6), the reasons for the
susceptibility of the tumor vasculature to VDAs remain unclear.
Tumor blood vessels are generally considered to be immature.
Thus, genetic modification of tumor cells to modulate expression
of key molecules involved in vascular maturation provides a
potential route for investigating the factors that influence the
response of the tumor vasculature to VDAs.
Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A or simply VEGF)
is a key stimulator of tumorigenic angiogenesis (7) and acts as a
mitogen, chemoattractant, survival factor, vasodilator, and permeability factor (8). Human and mouse VEGF mRNA is transcribed
from eight exons and alternatively spliced to give rise to a number
of isoforms of the protein product (9), the most prevalent
consisting of 121, 165, and 189 amino acids in the human and
120, 164, and 188 in the mouse (Fig. 1A). VEGF120/121 lacks the
heparin-binding site and is readily diffusible, whereas VEGF188/189
is tightly bound to proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix or on
the cell surface and VEGF164/165 has intermediate properties.
These isoforms are found in most normal tissues and have affinity
for the VEGF receptors, FLT1 (VEGFR1) and KDR (VEGFR2; refs.
10, 11). VEGF121 and VEGF165 are the most prevalent forms in
human cancers (12, 13).
Using Cre/Lox technology, mice expressing only single isoforms
of VEGF, known as Vegfa120/120, Vegfa164/164 , and Vegfa188/188 mice,
have been developed (14, 15). Their analysis revealed different
roles for the individual VEGF isoforms in vascular growth and
patterning during development. In particular, VEGF164 was sufficient for developmental angiogenesis and neonatal growth, and
VEGF120 supported endothelial cell proliferation and vasculogenesis;
however, angiogenic vessel branching was impaired and vessels

were hemorrhagic (16). VEGF188 was essential for the formation of
a normal cardiovasculature in 50% of mice (14, 15).
In the current study, we used the single VEGF isoform-expressing
mice and the counterpart wild-type mice to develop mouse
fibrosarcoma cell lines from embryo fibroblasts. We reasoned that
the different VEGF isoforms would give rise to tumors with very
different vascular characteristics that could be used to investigate
susceptibility to CA-4-P. The method of producing the tumor
lines was substantially different from previous studies in which
overexpression of individual VEGF isoforms was used (13, 17),
ensuring that VEGF gene transcription was under the control of the
endogenous VEGF promoter and thus susceptible to environmental

control. We gained new insights into the differential effects of
VEGF isoforms in tumors by using intravital microscopy and tumor
uptake of i.v. administered markers to measure functional vascular
end points, in addition to measuring vascular morphology and
tumor growth, with and without CA-4-P.

Materials and Methods
Animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the United
Kingdom Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and with local ethical
approval. CA-4-P was kindly provided by Professor G.R. Pettit (Arizona State
University, Tempe, AZ).

VEGF Isoforms and Tumor Response to Vascular Disruption
Tumor cell lines. Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts expressing single
isoforms of VEGF (120, 164, or 188) only or all isoforms (Fig. 1A) were
isolated from 13.5 dpc embryos produced by heterozygous breeding pairs of
single VEGF isoform-expressing mice on a Swiss background. Fibroblast
cultures were genotyped, as described (18), to identify wild-type samples and
those homozygous for the Vegfa120, Vegfa164 , or Vegfa188 allele. Fibroblasts
were immortalized and oncogenically transformed by retroviral transduction with SV40 and HRAS (h-ras; refs. 19, 20). The resulting fibrosarcoma
cell lines were maintained in high glucose DMEM (Invitrogen) medium
containing L-glutamine, FCS, and the antibiotics G-418 and puromycin.
Apoptosis. Apoptotic cell death in response to CA-4-P was evaluated
using the cell death detection ELISAplus kit (Roche Diagnostics), as previously described (21). Cells were plated at 104 cells/well in 24-well plates,
allowed to adhere for 24 h and then exposed to CA-4-P overnight before
analysis.
Subcutaneous tumor transplantation. Fibrosarcoma cells expressing
only VEGF120, VEGF164, or VEGF188 tumor cells or all three isoforms
(control tumor cells) were injected s.c. (1  106 cells in 0.05 mL) into the
rear dorsum of female severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice
(8–12 weeks old, 20–25 g).
VEGF-A mRNA and protein analysis. Excised tumors (6–8 mm
diameter) were collected into RNAlater (Ambion). RNA and protein were
isolated from tumor samples using the Mirvana PARIS kit (Ambion) and
from cell lines in culture using the Cells-to-cDNA11 kit, according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. VEGF isoforms were amplified using the
following PCR primers ( forward, 5¶CAGGCTGCTGTAACGATGAA3¶; and
reverse, 5¶CTTTCCGGTGAGAGGTCTGG3¶). Approximately 20% of each
PCR reaction, together with appropriate controls, was then run on 2%
agarose gels containing 1 Ag/mL of ethidium bromide and products
visualized under UV illumination.
For quantification of VEGF protein in culture supernatants, 2  106 cells
were plated in T-175 flasks, and at 24 h, the medium was replaced with
20 mL of fresh medium. Cells were incubated for a further 48 h and then
treated with 0.3 mmol/L of suramin for 3 h to release surface matrix-bound
VEGF where medium was collected. VEGF was quantified in the cell medium and tumor extracts using the Quantikine Immunoassay mouse VEGF
ELISA kit (R&D systems), according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
An antibody recognizing all VEGF-A isoforms (p20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used for Western blotting analysis. Cells were plated as above,
but at 24 h, the medium was replaced with medium without serum.
Conditioned media was collected 48 h later and concentrated 50-fold
(Amicon). Equal amounts of proteins were separated on NuPAGE Novex
gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Immunoreactive bands were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence.
Subcutaneous tumor growth. Subcutaneous tumors were measured
using calipers and tumor volume (V ) was calculated from V = 0.52  d1 
d2  d3, where d1, d2, and d3 are the three orthogonal tumor diameters.
Untreated tumor growth curves were fitted to ‘‘Gompertz’’ curves [V = exp
(a [b  (exp [ c  (t d)])])], where a, b, c, and d are fitted variables,
and t is time after transplant.
Tumors were treated when they reached 5 to 6 mm in diameter. CA-4-P
(50 mg/kg i.p., 10 mL/kg in saline) or saline alone, was given once a day for
10 days, with a 2-day gap between the fifth and sixth doses.
Tumor histology and immunohistochemistry. Subcutaneous tumors
(6–8 mm diameter) were formalin- or zinc-fixed, paraffin-embedded, and
stained to identify endothelial cells (rat anti-mouse CD31 monoclonal
antibody; BD PharMingen, Int.) and pericytes [mouse anti-mouse a-smooth
muscle actin (a-sma) monoclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich; or rabbit antimouse desmin polyclonal antibody, Abcam; or rabbit anti-mouse angiopoietin-1 (ANG1) polyclonal antibody, Chemicon]. Antibody binding was
visualized using 3,3¶-diaminobenzidine (DakoCytomation) and signal
amplification was achieved via the avidin-biotin complex/horseradish
peroxidase system (CD31, a-sma, ANG1) or the EnVision system (desmin).
Sections were counterstained with hematoxylin.
Mounted sections stained for CD31 and a-sma were quantified according
to a random points scoring system (22). One hundred and twenty highpower regions of interest were counted per tumor to give vascular volume

www.aacrjournals.org

as a percentage of tumor volume for CD31 staining. The percentage of
necrosis was measured from H&E sections by the same method or by
delineation of necrotic regions in MATLAB (The Mathworks, Inc.). Desmin
and ANG1 staining were assessed qualitatively.
Double staining immunofluorescence employed the CD31 monoclonal
antibody described above and a FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-mouse
a-sma antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). Sections were incubated with a goat
anti-rat Alexa-555 Red (Invitrogen) antibody. Sections were mounted in
4¶,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Vectashield (Vector Laboratories).
Window chamber surgery and tumor implantation. SCID mice
(12–16 weeks old, 28–32 g) were anesthetized using fentanyl-fluanisone and
midazolam i.p., as described previously (23). Briefly, an aluminum window
chamber (total weight, f2 g), holding two parallel glass windows, was
implanted into a dorsal skin flap. A tumor fragment (f0.5 mm in diameter)
from a donor animal was implanted onto the exposed panniculus muscle
before closing the chamber, allowing a depth of f200 Am for tumor growth.
Animals were given a s.c. injection of dextrose saline (1 mL) and an i.p.
injection of buprenorphine (0.1 mL, Vetergesic) to aid recovery and then
kept in a warm room (28–30jC), until the day of the experiment.
Intravital microscopy. Donor RBC, acquired via cardiac puncture from
donor mice were labeled with the fluorescent membrane dye, DiI
(Invitrogen), for the measurement of RBC velocity in the tumor vasculature,
as described previously (24–26). Tumors, at 3 to 5 mm in diameter, were
used for treatment f6 to 10 days after surgery.
Treated animals received either CA-4-P (30 mg/kg i.v. at a concentration
of 3 mg/mL in 0.9% NaCl) or the same volume of 0.9% NaCl. Transmitted
light images and video sequences (25 frames/s) were captured at various
magnifications and time points up to 24 h after treatment. For the
assessment of tumor vascularization in untreated tumors, imaging was
performed once per day for several days after tumor transplantation.
Average vessel length, total vascular length, and fractal dimensions were
acquired from transmitted light images using in-house–developed software,
as described previously (23, 27). A single vessel was defined as a vascular
length with no visible branches. RBC velocities were calculated from 20
objective video sequences, using epifluorescence illumination, as described
previously (26).
Macromolecular vascular leakage. FITC-labeled dextran (FITC-dextran; 40 kDa, 0.013 mol FITC/mol dextran; Sigma-Aldrich) was used as a
macromolecular marker for determining tumor blood vessel barrier
function. Following extensive washing to remove low-molecular weight
contaminants, FITC-dextran (20 mg/mL) was made up in PBS and administered i.v. to awake, restrained mice at 0.05 mL per mouse. Multiphoton
fluorescence microscopy, based on a modified Bio-Rad MRC 1024MP workstation, was used for imaging, as described previously (23). Images were
captured every 4 min, at a working excitation wavelength of 890 nm.
Emission wavelength was 530 to 540 nm. The three-dimensional data
consisted of 512  512  11 voxels each at a volume of 2.6  2.6  4.5 Am3.
Acquired images were processed, as described previously (28). Changes
in image fluorescence intensity over time were used as an index of tumor
vascular leakage of FITC-dextran. In addition, images from the first time
point were analyzed for ‘‘contiguity’’ to provide a quantitative measure of
vascular features in the different tumor lines. First, three-dimensional
images were segmented into intravascular and extravascular classes, based
on image intensities, as described previously (28). Then, each voxel within
the intravascular class was interrogated to determine the fraction of
neighboring voxels that were designated as being in the same class (29). The
average of this fraction, derived from analysis of all the intravascular voxels
from a particular tumor image, was defined as the contiguity of that tumor’s
vasculature. A highly contiguous vasculature suggests blood vessels that are
well connected, with large diameters and extending into a large fraction of
the tumor volume (diffuse).
Statistics. Statistical analysis was carried out using JMP Statistics
version 5.1 for the Apple Macintosh (SAS Institute, Inc.). The Student’s t test
for unpaired data was used to test for significant differences between two
groups. ANOVA followed by the Tukey-Kramer honest significance
difference (HSD) test was used to test for significant differences between
more than two groups. Time courses of intravital microscopy and tumor

growth data were fitted to a multivariate model (MANOVA) with repeated
measures, and differences in responses of the different lines were tested for
significance using an approximate F test. In all cases, differences between
groups were described as significant if the probability corresponding to the
appropriate statistic was <0.05.

Results
VEGF isoform expression. Fibrosarcoma cell lines expressing
only single isoforms of VEGF were generated from primary mouse
embryo fibroblasts isolated from isoform-specific mice. Figure 1B
shows that the isoform-specific cell lines expressed the expected
VEGF isoform transcripts, when grown in vitro or as solid tumors
in vivo. Some faint bands corresponding to alternative VEGF
isoforms were apparent for each of the isoform-specific tumor lines
when grown in vivo. These most likely derive from infiltrating
normal mouse cells, as we have observed moderate macrophage
infiltration in all four tumor types (data not shown). Control tumor

cell lines predominantly expressed the VEGF164 and VEGF120
mRNA (Fig. 1B). Sequencing of the lower band of the doublet that
is apparent just below VEGF164 in control tumor cell lines revealed
a mixed sequence, which corresponded to VEGF164 and VEGF120
(data not shown), suggesting that these two isoforms could form
a heteroduplex under these experimental conditions (30).
Total VEGF-A protein production, measured by ELISA, in
conditioned medium from the cells, was not significantly
different across the lines, although there was a tendency for
the highest production in control cells (Fig. 1C). VEGF levels in
cell lysates were very low by comparison (data not shown). For
tumors in vivo, total VEGF levels, measured by ELISA, were
highest in the VEGF164 line (Fig. 1C), despite equivalent
quantitative gene expression levels across the lines (see
Supplementary Fig. S1). This confirms a previous report of high
VEGF165 protein levels following transfection of MCF-7 tumor
cells with VEGF121, VEGF165, or VEGF189 (31). Hypoxia, a

common feature of the tumor microenvironment, was reported
to affect all isoforms of VEGF-A in a similar manner. However,
repeated oxygen fluctuations have been reported to specifically
increase VEGF164 in the retina (32) and this may be relevant to
our results.

Western analysis confirmed that the cell lines produced significant quantities of the appropriate VEGF isoform, and no others,
when cultured in vitro. However, protein expression of the
VEGF164 isoform was predominant and VEGF188 expression was
low and below detection limits in the control cell line (Fig. 1D).

tumor, normalized to the first time point
(mean for n = 5–7 tumors in each group;

two groups were significantly different
(P < 0.05, MANOVA with repeated
measures).

Attempts to carry out Western analysis on solid tumor extracts
were not successful, probably because levels were below the
sensitivity limits of the assay.
Vascular morphology. Established subcutaneous tumors were
examined for vascularity and maturity of their vessel walls using
immunohistochemistry. CD31 staining in Fig. 2A shows that
all tumor types were well-vascularized. However, a-sma staining
shows that control and VEGF188-expressing tumors were better
stabilized with pericytes than VEGF120- or VEGF164-expressing
tumors. Although this staining was apparent in blood vessel walls,
there was also substantial staining in a subset of extravascular cells.
Quantification of staining (Fig. 2B) showed that control and
VEGF120 tumors were the most vascular (CD31), whereas control
and VEGF188 tumors had the most a-sma staining. These differences were statistically significant (see legend for details). Further
investigations were carried out in the VEGF120-expressing (most
diffusible) and the VEGF188-expressing (nondiffusible) tumors.
Figure 2C shows double-staining for CD31 and a-sma, which confirmed the localization of a-sma–positive cells (pericytes) in the
vasculature of VEGF188 tumors and very little staining in the
VEGF120 tumors. The spiraling morphology of the a-sma staining
in the VEGF188 tumor indicates close contact between pericytes
and endothelial cells. Figure 2D shows that desmin- and ANG1-

Cancer Res 2008; 68: (7). April 1, 2008

positive cells were also preferentially found in VEGF188 tumors
rather than in VEGF120 tumors. The staining patterns were also
highly suggestive of vascular localization. Taken together, these
results indicate the association of VEGF120 with sustained
expansion of the tumor vasculature, whereas VEGF188 is uniquely
associated with maturation of the blood vessel wall.
Vascularization of single VEGF isoform–expressing tumors was
further analyzed by intravital microscopy. Figure 3A and Supplementary Fig. S2 illustrate the vascularization of VEGF120- and
VEGF188-expressing tumors at early and late phases of growth in
the window chamber. Initial vascularization of the VEGF120expressing tumors was typified by dilated preexisting normal blood
vessels, which were prone to hemorrhage and indistinct tumor
margins (Fig. 3A). In contrast, preexisting normal vessels were
narrower in the VEGF188 implants, there was very little or no
hemorrhage and the tumor margins were distinct. As tumors grew,
hemorrhage within the VEGF120-expressing tumors tended to
resolve but vascularization was often limited to the periphery of
the tumor mass. In contrast, VEGF188-expressing tumors were
vascularized throughout the tumor mass (Fig. 3A). Control and
VEGF164-expressing tumors had intermediate properties.
Quantitative morphologic analysis of tumor blood vessels was
carried out on two peri-peripheral regions of interest within each

tumor, using a 10 objective, once the tumors became optimally
vascularized. The vascular patterning in the VEGF188 tumors stood
out from the others in that the blood vessels were arranged more
regularly and individual vessels were uniformly narrow. Blood
vessels in the other tumor types were irregular in width but
generally wider and very chaotic in their arrangement. Typical
regions of interest in a VEGF120- and VEGF188–expressing tumor
are shown in Fig. 3B. Quantitative analysis revealed no significant
difference between the tumor lines in terms of mean vascular
lengths or fractal dimensions (data not shown). However, the total

vascular length was higher in the VEGF188 tumors than in any of
the other tumor types (Fig. 3C).
Vascular function. Leakage of i.v. injected 40 kDa fluorescent
dextran was monitored in VEGF120 and VEGF188 tumors growing
in window chambers, using multiphoton fluorescence microscopy
(Fig. 4). Figure 4A shows typical images with diffuse vascularization
and rapid leakage in a VEGF120 tumor compared with a VEGF188
tumor. Contiguity data for the whole group (Fig. 4B), is consistent
with the diffuse nature of the vasculature in VEGF120 tumors,
wider diameter vessels, and leakiness. Figure 4C shows the kinetics

Figure 6. A, tumor volume growth curves for all tumor types growing
subcutaneously in SCID mice F CA-4-P treatment [10 fractions of 50 mg/kg
of CA-4-P i.p. or equal volumes of saline, at times indicated (arrows )].
Untreated tumor growth curves (solid lines ) were fitted to Gompertz curves,
as described in the text. The lag phase in tumor growth was shorter for VEGF120
and VEGF164 tumors than for control and VEGF188 tumors. However,
at 18 d, untreated tumor growth rate was 73.4 F 7.8, 86.2 F 8.0,
86.3 F 18.3, 59.2 F 5.4 mm3/d for control, VEGF120-, VEGF164-, and
VEGF188-expressing tumors, respectively. These differences were not
significant (P > 0.05, ANOVA), which was consistent with similar blood flow
rates in the four cell lines (see Supplementary Fig. S4). VEGF120- and
VEGF164-expressing tumors responded better to CA-4-P treatment (broken
lines) than VEGF188-expressing and control tumors. Points, mean for tumors

VEGF120 and VEGF188 tumors, with average intensity decreasing

VEGF120 tumors. This difference was consistent with more rapid

leakage of FITC-dextran from the intravascular to extravascular
space in the VEGF120 tumors, which maintained average image
intensity in the face of vascular clearance of the marker.
Response to CA-4-P. Vascular response to CA-4-P was determined in tumors growing in window chambers. Figure 5A shows
typical images from VEGF120- and VEGF188-expressing tumors at
0, 1, and 24 h following treatment with a moderate single dose of
CA-4-P (30 mg/kg i.v.). Response in both tumor types was typified
by a substantial loss of the visible vasculature, primarily at
the tumor center, at 1 h after treatment. Subsequently, VEGF120expressing tumors progressed to almost complete avascularity and
opacity of the central tumor region at 24 h. The vascular morphology was substantially less affected in the VEGF188 tumors,
with very little avascularity by 24 h (Fig. 5A).
Quantitation of the vascular damage in window chamber tumors
following CA-4-P treatment is shown in Fig. 5B and C for all the
tumor types. There is a clear distinction in response between the
VEGF120 and VEGF164 tumors on the one hand, and the wild-type
and VEGF188 tumors on the other, confirming the observations
shown in Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S3, which gives additional
images from all tumor types. The distinction in response of the
different tumor types was clearly apparent from both a morphologic end point (total vessel length; Fig. 5B) and a functional end
point (red cell velocity; Fig. 5C).
In order to determine whether these differences in early vascular
response to CA-4-P translated into differences in therapeutic
response, a repeat dosing schedule of CA-4-P was administered to
mice bearing subcutaneous tumors (Fig. 6A). VEGF120 and VEGF164
tumors were, again, the most sensitive. Interestingly, although
the control and VEGF188 tumors seemed to be completely resistant
to the effects of CA-4-P in the first week of treatment, there was
some growth retardation during the second week. In a separate
experiment, VEGF120-expressing tumors were significantly more
necrotic than VEGF188-expressing tumors at 24 h after a single
100 mg/kg dose of CA-4-P (79.5 F 9.3% versus 42.8 F 9.3% of tumor
volume, respectively, P < 0.05 for Student’s t test). However, after
five doses of 50 mg/kg CA-4-P, as in Fig. 6A, the necrosis levels in the
two tumor types were very similar (34.3 F 7.2% and 41.1 F 9.2%,
respectively), suggesting that the responsiveness of the 188 tumors in
the second week was due to increased sensitivity of the vasculature.
Vascular volume in viable regions of VEGF120-expressing tumors, as
measured by CD31 staining, significantly increased from 7.2 F 0.5%
to 11.0 F 0.6% of tumor volume after a week’s treatment (P < 0.05
for Student’s t test). A similar trend in the VEGF188-expressing
tumors was only borderline significant. Figure 6A also shows that
untreated VEGF120- and VEGF164-expressing tumors reached a
measurable size f4 days before the VEGF188 and control tumors,
but then, all lines grew at the same rate, consistent with comparable
blood flow rates (Supplementary Fig. S4). CA-4-P (100 Amol/L)
increased apoptosis in all the cell lines growing in vitro, with no
significant difference in induction rates between the different cell
lines (Fig. 6B).

Discussion
We have shown that mouse fibrosarcoma cells, which express
only single isoforms of VEGF, under the control of the endogenous
VEGF promoter, produce tumors with very different vascularization patterns, vessel wall structure, and barrier function. The
method used for production of the tumor lines ensured normal
overall VEGF levels. Expression of VEGF188, even at very low levels,

VEGF Isoforms and Tumor Response to Vascular Disruption

was uniquely associated with extensive recruitment of vascular
support cells (pericytes) and tumor resistance to the VDA CA-4-P.
Overall, our results support the view that VEGF188 expression
results in a different type of vascular bed, which renders the tumor
vasculature less susceptible to CA-4-P.
Our data support previous findings that VEGF120/121 is associated with hemorrhage and vasodilation around tumors (33, 34).
They are in agreement with Grunstein et al. (17) who found that
VEGF120 and VEGF164 were associated with rapid initiation of
fibrosarcoma growth. In contrast with our findings, Grunstein et al.
found poor tumor growth associated with a fibrosarcoma cell
line expressing only VEGF188. This may be due to high levels of
VEGF188 in their overexpressing tumor line, leading to overvascularization of tumors. Indeed, Grunstein et al. found particularly
poor vascular filling of contrast agent in their VEGF188-expressing
tumors. In both studies, endogenous VEGF production from
normal cells such as macrophages might be expected to contribute
to vascular development. We found moderate macrophage invasion
in all tumor types. However, our reverse transcription-PCR results
showed that host-derived expression of VEGF isoforms was very
low in all tumors and this was consistent with substantial
differences in the vascular characteristics we observed. Quantitative differences in expression levels may explain why some authors
have found that tumor cells transfected to overexpress VEGF188/
189 are nontumorigenic (13), whereas others are tumorigenic
(34–36). Interestingly, selective down-regulation of VEGF189
expression in a non–small cell lung cancer (35) and pancreatic
cancer cell line (36) significantly reduced their xenotransplantability, suggesting that VEGF188/189 does play an important role in
tumorigenesis.
We found striking differences in the maturation status of the
vascular wall in the different VEGF isoform–producing tumors,
which related to response to CA-4-P. In particular, the presence of
VEGF188 resulted in tumor vascular recruitment of mural cells.
This is consistent with the observations that mice selectively
expressing VEGF188 recruit mural cells normally to the developing
retinal venules and capillaries, whereas mice selectively expressing
VEGF120 show major defects in mural cell recruitment (15). In
addition, we showed that ANG1 was expressed in a subset of
vessels in VEGF188 tumors and that barrier function in the
VEGF188 tumors was more effective than in VEGF120 tumors,
consistent with the observed structural differences. The processes
involved in mural cell recruitment are complex and poorly
understood but undoubtedly involve growth factors in addition
to VEGF, such as platelet-derived growth factor B (PDGFB; ref. 37).
Nevertheless, the current result clearly shows a key role for
VEGF188 in mural cell recruitment in tumors that is associated
with a functional effect. In addition, positive staining for a-sma
was found in a subset of extravascular cells, presumably tumor cells
or fibroblasts, of the VEGF188-expressing and control tumors but
not in the VEGF120- or VEGF164-expressing tumors. This suggests
a novel role for VEGF188/189 in pericyte differentiation.
Vascular network development was highly influenced by
differential expression of VEGF isoforms, with VEGF120 being
associated with a high vascular volume in established subcutaneous tumors and VEGF188 being associated with regular, narrow
vessels and a high vascular length per tumor volume. In tumors
growing in window chambers, which are subjected to high tissue
pressure induced by the restraining glass, VEGF120 and VEGF164
were associated with a failure to effectively vascularize the center
of tumors. This is likely to be due to the fragility of blood vessels,

www.aacrjournals.org

suggested by their lack of mural cells. Expression of VEGF164 was
associated with a relatively low vascular volume (similar to
VEGF188) but rapid initiation of tumor growth (similar to
VEGF120). This suggests a highly proliferating phenotype for
VEGF120- and VEGF164-expressing tumor cells, at the expense of
vascular maturation. This is consistent with our recent in vitro
data, showing higher proliferation rates for VEGF120- or VEGF164expressing tumor cells than VEGF188-expressing or control cells
(ref. 20; Supplementary Table S1). Any differences between the
vasculature in VEGF120- and VEGF164-expressing tumors were
subtle. However, the difference in vascular volume and the qualitative observation of less hemorrhage in the VEGF164 tumors does
suggest some differences in their control of vascular maturation, an
observation that warrants further investigation.
Several explanations for the different effects of individual VEGF
isoforms on tumor vascular morphology and function can be
envisaged. In the developing brain of Vegfa188/188 mice, there is an
increased extension of endothelial filopodia and vascular branch
formation, compared with brains of Vegfa120/120 mice (16), and this
might also apply to tumor angiogenesis. There is also evidence
for differential activation of VEGF receptors by the different
isoforms. First, VEGF164/165 (and probably VEGF188/189) but not
VEGF120/121, can bind to the accessory receptor, neuropilin-1
(NRP1; ref. 38). However, impaired signaling through the NRP-1
receptor could not account for all vascular branching defects in
Vegfa120/120 mouse embryos (16) and would not explain the significant differences between VEGF164- and VEGF188-expressing
tumors. Heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the cell surface have also
been implicated in modifying VEGF signaling, partly by controlling
the distribution and bioavailability of secreted VEGF (39, 40).
Other possibilities, which remain poorly understood, include the
translocation of intracellular VEGF188/189 to the nucleus (31) and
the cross-talk of VEGF signaling pathways with integrins (41).
In interpreting our data, we cannot discount the possibility that
an adaptive response to the depletion of VEGF120 or VEGF164,
resulting in increased expression of alternative vascular-related
growth factors in the VEGF188-expressing cell line, could explain
our results. Notwithstanding potential affinity issues of the VEGF
antibody used in the ELISA kit for VEGF188, VEGF protein expression in the VEGF188 line in vivo seems to be relatively low (Fig. 1C),
highlighting this possibility. However, real-time PCR data (Supplementary Fig. S1) did not reveal any alternative candidate genes
for explaining our results. Transformation significantly lowered
VEGFR2, NRP1, TIE2, Ang2, and Hey2 gene expression across all the
lines, but only Ang2 and PDGFB differed in their expression levels
between the VEGF188-expressing tumor cells and the other cell
types. Increased Ang2 and lowered PDGFB levels, as found in
the VEGF188-expressing line, are unlikely explanations for the
observed increase in pericyte recruitment of this line in vivo
because Ang2 is normally associated with vascular immaturity and
PDGFB is a well-known chemoattractant for pericytes. In addition,
administration of VEGF receptor kinase inhibitors in vitro and
in vivo and a pan-isoform neutralizing antibody for VEGF in vitro,
equalized both tumor cell proliferation in vitro and vascular
morphology in vivo, across the different cell lines, suggesting that
baseline differences in these variables were VEGF-induced
(Supplementary Fig. S5; Supplementary Table S1).
Differential expression of VEGF isoforms was clearly associated
with outcome following treatment with the VDA, CA-4-P, both in
terms of initial vascular response and tumor growth response to a
repeated dosing schedule. A modest growth response, as observed

here even for the VEGF120-expressing tumors, is not unusual for
VDAs and could mask significant cell-killing effects. This is thought
to be due primarily to poor clearance of dead cells because of blood
flow reduction (42). The presence of VEGF188, even at low levels
in the control tumors, conferred resistance to treatment. Although
speculative, it is possible that very tight association of VEGF188
with the cell surface minimizes the amount of protein necessary
for a given outcome, as well as negatively feeding back on VEGF188
production. Necrosis data showed that VEGF188 tumors suffered
vascular damage in the first week of treatment despite the lack
of growth response. This may have been sufficient to sensitize
the tumors to continued treatment. CD31 staining indicated an
increase in vascularization of re-growing viable tumor regions after
the first week of treatment, which could relate to homing of bone
marrow–derived vascular progenitor cells following CA-4-P treatment, as previously reported (43). This increased vascularization
may also relate to increased sensitivity to CA-4-P in the second
week of treatment, although potential mechanisms require further
investigation. Finally, the larger size of tumors at the start of
treatment in the second week may have contributed to increased
sensitivity (44).
Previously, we hypothesized that high vascular permeability and
the immaturity of the vascular wall were major factors associated
with the sensitivity of tumor vasculature to CA-4-P and similar
agents (45, 46). The current results substantiate this hypothesis,

and furthermore, suggest that VEGF188 expression is uniquely
predictive of treatment outcome. Interestingly, several studies have
suggested that VEGF189 expression in human cancers is associated
with tumor progression and poor outcome from conventional
treatments (47–50).
In conclusion, the main VEGF isoforms, under the control of
the endogenous VEGF promoter, have very different effects on
vascularization of fibrosarcomas in an animal model. In
particular, VEGF188 and/or associated gene expression plays a
crucial role in tumor vascular maturation and conferring
resistance to the VDA, CA-4-P. Therefore, VEGF isoform
expression may be useful for predicting tumor susceptibility to
vascular-disrupting cancer therapy.
