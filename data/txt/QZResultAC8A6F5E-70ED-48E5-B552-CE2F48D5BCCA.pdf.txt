BACKGROUND: The objectives of this study were to provide sunitinib to patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) who
were otherwise unable to obtain it and to collect broad safety and efficacy data from a large population of patients with advanced
GIST after imatinib failure. METHODS: Imatinib-resistant/intolerant patients with advanced GIST received sunitinib on an initial dosing
schedule of 50 mg daily in 6-week cycles (4 weeks on treatment, 2 weeks off treatment). Tumor assessment frequency was according
to local practice, and response was assessed by investigators according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.0.
Overall survival (OS) and safety were assessed regularly. Post hoc analyses evaluated different patterns of treatment management.
RESULTS: At final data cutoff, 1124 patients comprised the intent-to-treat population, and 15% of these patients had a baseline Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 2. The median treatment duration was 7.0 months. The median time to tumor progression was 8.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.0-9.4 months), the median OS was 16.6 months (95% CI, 14.9-18.0 months),
and 36% of patients were alive at the time of analysis. Patients for whom the initial dosing schedule was modified exhibited longer
median OS (23.5 months) than those who were treated strictly according to the initial dosing schedule (11.1 months). The most common treatment-related grade 3 and 4 adverse events were hand-foot syndrome (11%), fatigue (9%), neutropenia (8%), hypertension
(7%), and thrombocytopenia (6%). Treatment-related adverse events associated with cardiac function (eg, congestive heart failure
and myocardial infarction) were reported at frequencies of 1% each. CONCLUSIONS: This treatment-use study confirms the longterm safety and efficacy of sunitinib in a large international population of patients with advanced GIST after imatinib failure. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Sunitinib malate (SUTENT; Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) is an oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)
approved for the treatment of patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on
or intolerance to the moderately selective TKI imatinib mesylate. Sunitinib inhibits several oncogenically relevant receptor
tyrosine kinases, including KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-a,1,2 both of which have been implicated in
the pathogenesis of GIST.3-5 The efficacy and safety of sunitinib in imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant patients were
established in a pivotal phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled study, which demonstrated a 4-fold increase in the time
to progression (TTP) for sunitinib versus placebo.6,7
We report the final results from a worldwide treatment-use study, the main objective of which was to provide access
to sunitinib to patients with GIST who might benefit from this therapy but who had no other means of obtaining the
drug (eg, they were ineligible for other sunitinib clinical trials, no GIST trials were available in a particular country, or

regulatory approval had not yet been granted). This study,
the largest trial conducted in any single type of sarcoma to
date, provided an opportunity to evaluate the long-term
safety and efficacy of sunitinib in an inclusive, international
patient population. It also allowed us to perform exploratory analyses evaluating treatment scenarios that emerged
during the study and differed from the initial dosing schedule (IDS) (sunitinib 50 mg daily on a 4-week-on/2-weekoff treatment schedule [schedule 4/2]), and it provided an
opportunity to evaluate continuing versus discontinuing
TKI therapy after disease progression.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and Study Design

Patient eligibility criteria included age 18 years for all
centers (certain centers enrolled patients aged <18 years
when allowed by the institutional review board/independent ethics committee); histologically confirmed, malignant GIST not amenable to standard therapy with
curative intent after failure of prior imatinib therapy
(because of either disease progression or intolerance);
ineligibility for participation in ongoing sunitinib clinical
studies; potential to derive clinical benefit from sunitinib
treatment; resolution of all acute toxic effects from any
prior therapy or surgical procedure to National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (CTCAE) version 3.0 grade 18; and adequate
organ function. Exclusion criteria included current treatment in another therapeutic clinical trial, central nervous
system metastases, and cardiovascular disease. The study
conformed to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki
and International Conference on Harmonisation Good
Clinical Practice guidelines. The institutional review
boards/independent ethics committees of participating
study centers approved the protocol. All participants provided written, informed consent.
Sunitinib Dosage and Administration

The IDS for sunitinib was 50 mg daily on schedule 4/2. A
protocol amendment implemented in May 2006 allowed
patients to switch to 37.5 mg on a continuous daily dosing
(CDD) schedule as an alternative. Dose reductions were
permitted in the event of toxicity. Because of the flexibility
allowed investigators in the study, treatment scenarios
other than the IDS were used by physicians to optimize
patient tolerability; these are termed alternative dosing
schedules (ADSs) in this report, noting that the phrase
“flexible dosing” was used previously in a preliminary presentation of these results.9 Sunitinib dosing was continued
as long as there was evidence of disease control/clinical
1406

benefit in the investigator’s judgment; and survival was
monitored for 2 years from the date of the final sunitinib dose or until July 2008, whichever came first.
Study Assessments

The frequency of tumor assessments/measurements was
not specified in the protocol but was determined according to the local standard of care for GIST. Objective
responses and TTP were assessed by investigators using
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
version 1.0.10 Overall survival (OS) was monitored. Safety
and tolerability were assessed by monitoring adverse events
(AEs) and laboratory abnormalities and by history and
physical examination of patients. Toxicities were evaluated
every 14 days during cycle 1, on days 1 and 28 of cycle 2,
on day 1 of all subsequent cycles, at the end of treatment/
withdrawal, and approximately 28 days after the final
sunitinib dose and were graded using CTCAE version 3.0.
Statistical Analysis

Because of the nature of this trial, the number of patients
enrolled was not predetermined, and no inferential analyses or hypothesis testing were planned. The study population (intention-to treat [ITT] population) for efficacy and
safety analyses comprised all patients who received at least
1 dose of sunitinib. TTP and OS were estimated using the
Kaplan-Meier method.
Post Hoc Analyses

Post hoc analyses were performed to evaluate patients’
clinical outcomes after stratification based on patterns of
sunitinib dosing that emerged during the study. In 1 analysis, patients were dichotomized based on whether they
were treated by strict adherence to the IDS throughout
the study (ie, without any changes in dose level or schedule) or whether the dose and/or schedule they received
was modified at any time during the study (ie, to dose levels other than 50 mg daily and/or schedules other than
schedule 4/2, including the CDD schedule, noting that
these changes were not defined prospectively but were
derived post hoc from data review). In the other analysis,
patients were dichotomized based on whether sunitinib
therapy was continued or stopped after objective
investigator-assessed progressive disease (PD). Hazard
ratios were not calculated for these post hoc analyses.
RESULTS
Between September 2004 and December 2007, 1131
patients were enrolled in the study at 108 sites in 34 countries. At final data cutoff (November 2011), 1124 patients
(99%) had received at least 1 dose of sunitinib (ITT

Efficacy

The ITT population was followed for a median of 34.6
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.0-37.3
months). The median estimated TTP was 8.3 months
(95% CI, 8.0-9.4 months) (Fig. 1A). Four hundred eight
patients (36%) in the ITT population were alive at the
time of analysis, and the median estimated OS was 16.6
months (95% CI, 14.9-18.0 months) (Fig. 1B). The overall confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 8%
(95% exact CI, 6%-10%). Sixty percent of patients had
stable disease as their best response, and 45% were progression free for >6 months.
The median TTP was 12.7 months (95% CI, 11.114.1 months) in the ADS group compared with 5.2
months (95% CI, 4.4-5.5 months) in the IDS group (Fig.
2A). At the time of analysis, 218 patients in the ADS
group (42%) and 186 patients in the IDS group (31%)
were alive. The median OS was 23.5 months (95% CI,
21.8-27.0 months) and 11.1 months (95% CI, 9.9-12.5
months) in the ADS and IDS groups, respectively (Fig.
2B). Patients who continued on sunitinib after PD did so
for a median of 4.7 months after PD. The median OS from
the start of treatment among patients who remained on
treatment after PD was 22.8 months (95% CI, 20.4-24.7
months) and 13.2 months (95% CI, 11.7-14.5 months)
among those who did not remain on treatment (Fig. 3).

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
(ECOG PS) 2 was 15%. Baseline characteristics of the
patient subgroups evaluated in the post hoc analyses are
listed in Table 2.
The median number of sunitinib cycles started was 5
(range, 1-62 cycles started) (Table 3). The median treatment duration was 7.0 months (range, <0.1 to 75.4
months), and 363 patients (32%) remained on treatment
for >1 year. Overall, 592 patients (53%) had dosing
interruptions; in 470 patients (42%), these interruptions
were related to AEs. Four hundred eighty-four patients
(43%) had dose reductions. Patients in the ADS group
remained on treatment longer than those in the IDS
group (median, 9 vs 3 cycles started) (Table 4). They also
had a longer median time on drug, a higher median total
dose administered, and more dosing interruptions.
Patients who continued on treatment after PD remained
on treatment longer (median, 9 vs 4 cycles started from
treatment initiation) and had a longer median time on
drug and a higher median total dose administered than
those who did not continue treatment.

Fatigue (42%), diarrhea (40%), hand-foot syndrome
(32%), and nausea (29%) were the most commonly
reported, treatment-related, nonhematologic AEs (Table 5).
These were mainly grade 1 or 2 in severity. Hand-foot
syndrome (11%), fatigue (9%), hypertension (7%), and
diarrhea (5%) were the most commonly reported,
treatment-related, nonhematologic grade 3 or 4 AEs.
Treatment-related hypothyroidism (any grade), which
was defined based on elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level and symptomatology according to CTCAE,
was reported in 13% of patients. The frequencies of
treatment-related grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia were 8%, 6%, and 5%, respectively
(Table 5). Febrile neutropenia was reported in only 3
patients (all in the ADS group). Treatment-related AEs
associated with cardiac function included heart failure,
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, reduced
ejection fraction, and pulmonary edema (as reported by
investigators; 1% each) (Table 6). Seventeen grade 5
AEs (2%) considered to be related to treatment were
reported in the study (Table 5). Fifty-three percent of
patients had a dosing interruption or a dose reduction

For schedule 4/2 (sunitinib 50 mg daily on a 4-week-on/2-week-off treatment schedule), time on treatment was the period starting from the date of
first dose and ending at the earlier of the termination date or the last dose

Incidences of grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities
associated with renal function included hyponatremia

(6%), hypocalcemia (4%), and elevated creatinine levels
(2%). Incidences of grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities
associated with liver function included elevated levels of
lipase (19%), alkaline phosphatase (6%), total bilirubin
(5%), aspartate aminotransferase (4%), alanine aminotransferase (2%), and amylase (1%).
The overall rate of treatment-related AEs was higher
among patients in the ADS group (98%) compared with
those in the IDS group (86%) (Table 7). However, the
proportion of patients who permanently discontinued
sunitinib because of AEs was higher in the IDS group
than in the ADS group (34% vs 26%, respectively). The
most common treatment-related AEs in both groups were
fatigue, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome, which were
mainly grade 1 or 2. When adjusted for duration of
treatment, the overall incidences of AEs as well as incidences of the most common AEs (with the exception of
hypothyroidism) were lower in the ADS group than in the
IDS group (Table 7). In addition, when adjusted for duration of treatment, incidences of the most common grade 3
or 4 events were similar or slightly higher in the ADS
group versus the IDS group, with the exception of
anemia, which was higher in the IDS group.
The overall rate of treatment-related AEs was somewhat higher among patients who continued sunitinib
treatment after PD (96%) compared with those who did
not continue sunitinib (93%) (Table 8). The most common treatment-related AEs in both groups were diarrhea,
fatigue, and hand-foot syndrome, which were mainly

of imatinib. With >1100 patients enrolled, this is the
largest trial conducted in any type of sarcoma to date. The
trial, as a treatment-use study, involved a broader and
more inclusive patient population than previous sunitinib
studies in GIST (eg, 15% of patients had a baseline

ECOG PS 2), and the safety and efficacy results reflect
experience with sunitinib in a population that more
robustly represents routine clinical practice.
Although the presence of measurable disease was not
an eligibility criterion in this study and tumor response
was monitored according to the local standard of care
with no mandatory frequency of radiologic assessment
specified in the protocol, data on the best response were
collected based on RECIST. The observed ORR (8%)
was consistent with that reported in the phase 1/2 and pivotal phase 3 trials of sunitinib in GIST (7%)7,11 but was
lower than that in the phase 2 trial with sunitinib given by
CDD (13%).12 However, tumor response data were missing for 158 patients (14%). The median TTP in the current study (8.3 months or 36.0 weeks) was higher than
that reported in the phase 3 study (26.6 weeks)7 and was
similar to the median progression-free survival reported in
the phase 2 CDD study (34 weeks).12 These differences
may have been caused by the lower frequency of tumor
assessments in the current study or by differences in the
patient populations in the 2 studies. The median OS in
the current study was 16.6 months (or 72.1 weeks) and
represents an important addition to our understanding of
the survival benefit that long-term treatment with sunitinib can provide to such a large international patient population. Although the median OS in the current study
was lower than that reported in the phase 2 CDD study
(107 weeks),12 it was very similar to that reported in the
phase 3 study (72.7 weeks).7 Overall, these current data
are comparable to those previously reported, despite the
relatively high proportion of patients (15%) with baseline ECOG PS 2 (compared with 1%-2% of patients
1410

with an ECOG PS of 2 in the phase 3 and CDD
studies7,12).
In post hoc analysis stratifying patients according to
whether they continued or discontinued sunitinib treatment after PD, those who continued treatment had
improved outcomes (prolonged OS). Although these
results must be interpreted with caution and require validation in prospective clinical trials for confirmation, they
do suggest the benefits of continuing treatment despite
PD, depending on alternatives available for an individual
patient. The difference observed between the 2 groups, in
part, may reflect different tumor biologies (ie, patients
whose disease progressed more slowly may have continued
treatment more frequently than patients whose disease
progressed more rapidly). Tumor mutational differences,
as well as differences in interlesional and/or intralesional
genetic heterogeneity, also may have been underlying factors; unfortunately, tumor mutational analysis was not
conducted across this study. The results may also have
been affected by selection bias: frequencies of prognostic
factors (known or unknown) may have differed between
the 2 subgroups. In addition, the groups may have differed in the treatments that patients received after discontinuing sunitinib, but this information is not available.
Nonetheless, these results agree with recent findings
obtained with imatinib, suggesting that continued TKI
treatment or TKI rechallenge in patients with GIST is
beneficial.13,14
In the current study, dosing interruptions and/or
reductions were implemented in a relatively high proportion of patients (53% and 43%, respectively). This active
management of sunitinib dosing allowed prolonged

These were events that occurred in 10% of patients in the intent-to-treat
population.
b
Seventeen grade 5 events that were considered to be treatment-related
occurred in the study (cardiac failure, n 5 2; and death, disease progression, embolism, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, hemolysis, hepatic failure,
hepatotoxicity, multiorgan failure, myocardial infarction, performance status
decrease, peritoneal hemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, rectal hemorrhage,
sepsis, and tumor hemorrhage occurred in 1 patient each).
c
One patient was missing data on mucosal inflammation.

continuing treatment because of an AE (15%) compared
with those who stopped treatment because of lack of efficacy (64%). Results from post hoc analysis comparing
clinical outcomes in patients who ultimately received
sunitinib on ADSs versus those who received only the IDS
suggest that this prolonged treatment may have led to
improved outcomes, including prolonged TTP and OS.
Although several factors may have contributed to these
improvements, it is likely that close follow-up and prompt
dose modification allowed patients to avoid certain toxicities and to receive therapy for a longer period. Although
these results suggest a possible benefit in individualization
of treatment, prospective data comparing the approved
dosing schedule (50 mg daily on schedule 4/2) for sunitinib with other dosing schedules in GIST are currently
lacking. Although the current treatment-use protocol was
not designed to address the question of whether dosing
schedules other than that approved might provide advantages for some patients, and although the post hoc analyses were conducted solely for the purpose of hypothesis
generation, 1 important lesson that can be taken from
these results is that the management of AEs early and often is an important key to optimizing treatment.
The safety profile of sunitinib in the current
treatment-use study, with its relatively long duration of
treatment, was very similar to that observed in the sunitinib phase 1, 2, and 3 GIST studies. Individual AEs were
mostly mild to moderate in severity, and the rates of grade
3 or 4 AEs were similar to those reported in previous studies,7,11,12 although the total frequency of grade 3 or 4 AEs
(52%) was higher than that of grade 1 or 2 AEs (39%).
No new or unexpected toxicities were observed with longterm exposure to sunitinib.
The frequencies of AEs that are known as part of the
sunitinib safety profile and require monitoring, such as
hypothyroidism and hypertension, also were consistent
with those in previous reports.7,11,12 Treatment-related
cardiovascular AEs of any grade were reported at low

frequencies (all 1%), consistent with long-term results
from the phase 3 study, in which the total incidence of
cardiac AEs of all grades was 12%.7 A higher frequency of
congestive heart failure (8%) was reported in a retrospective, adjudicated analysis of 75 patients at a single center
in a noncomparative, open-label, phase 1/2 study of sunitinib in GIST.15 The differences in frequencies of cardiovascular events reported in those studies may reflect the
different methodologies used. Although routine monitoring of patients with cardiac risk factors is now recommended,16 this approach was not standard practice when
the current trial was initiated in 2004; consequently, neither baseline assessment of left ventricular function nor
prospective monitoring of specific cardiovascular AEs
were mandated in this study. Nevertheless, the majority of
cardiac AEs were managed by cardiologists in this study
according to standard practice. A retrospective, adjudicated analysis of cardiovascular AEs based on data from
sunitinib phase 3 studies that included comparator arms
(the phase 3 GIST study and a phase 3 study in renal cell
carcinoma) indicated that, although hypertension, hypertensive crises, and left ventricular ejection fraction
decreases occurred significantly more frequently with
sunitinib treatment, congestive heart failure (and several
other cardiovascular AEs) did not.17

of evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of sunitinib

in an international population of patients with advanced
GIST after imatinib failure who were ineligible for other
sunitinib clinical trials. The results observed here confirm
those reported in the more restricted and selected population of patients accrued to the pivotal phase 3 study. With
appropriate dose adjustment, many patients tolerate prolonged dosing with sunitinib and benefit from a median
delay in progression of their disease of approximately 8
months.
