ABSTRACT
LTX-315 has been developed as an amphipathic cationic peptide that kills
cancer cells. Here, we investigated the putative involvement of mitochondria in
the cytotoxic action of LTX-315. Subcellular fractionation of LTX-315-treated cells,
followed by mass spectrometric quantification, revealed that the agent was enriched
in mitochondria. LTX-315 caused an immediate arrest of mitochondrial respiration
without any major uncoupling effect. Accordingly, LTX-315 disrupted the mitochondrial
network, dissipated the mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, and caused
the release of mitochondrial intermembrane proteins into the cytosol. LTX-315 was
relatively inefficient in stimulating mitophagy. Cells lacking the two pro-apoptotic
multidomain proteins from the BCL-2 family, BAX and BAK, were less susceptible
to LTX-315-mediated killing. Moreover, cells engineered to lose their mitochondria
(by transfection with Parkin combined with treatment with a protonophore causing
mitophagy) were relatively resistant against LTX-315, underscoring the importance
of this organelle for LTX-315-mediated cytotoxicity. Altogether, these results support
the notion that LTX-315 kills cancer cells by virtue of its capacity to permeabilize
mitochondrial membranes.

mitochondria.
Among
such
mitochondriotropic
agents,
those endowed with the capacity of permeabilizing
mitochondrial membranes are particularly interesting [5,
6, 8]. Such agents can stimulate the intrinsic apoptotic
pathway (which involves an obligate step of mitochondrial
outer membrane permeabilization, MOMP) in a direct
fashion [9]. Hence, instead of indirectly eliciting MOMP
downstream of organellar stress pathways, usually the
DNA damage response (which is frequently deactivated
in cancer cells, causing drug resistance), mitochondriontargeted anticancer agents can directly stimulate MOMP
thereby kicking off the apoptotic cascade [9, 10]. Hence
direct MOMP inducers can ignite cell death pathways
downstream of the usual roadblocks (such as inactivation
of the p53 pathway) that mediate resistance to many
anticancer agents.
Cationic amphiphilic agents can induce
mitochondrial permeabilization by virtue of their capacity
to selectively enrich at the level of the inner mitochondrial
membrane, as a result of their distribution following
electrochemical gradients. Such agents incorporate into
mitochondria, first driven by the plasma membrane
potential and then again by the local transmembrane
potential (∆ψm), following the Nernst equation [1116]. Cationic amphiphilic agents exist naturally as
antimicrobial peptides with broad-spectrum antibiotic
activity, as exemplified by bovine lactoferricin. Since
lactoferricin also mediates anticancer effects [17-19],
efforts have been undertaken to generate lactoferricin
analogues with improved oncolytic activity, giving rise to
the design of LTX-315 a modified synthetic peptide that
is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of
advanced cancer. LTX-315 has the particularity to induce
the regression of B16 melanomas in vivo upon its local
injection into the tumor [20]. This effect is accompanied
by the infiltration of the tumor by T lymphocytes and the
elicitation of an anticancer immune response.
Here we addressed the question as to whether LTX315 truly targets the mitochondrial compartment for cell
death induction or whether this agent may act through
additional (off-target) effects. The results of our work
reveal multiple pieces of evidence indicating that LTX-315
acts on-target, via the permeabilization of mitochondria,
thereby killing cancer cells.

exposed to doses of LTX-315 that are non-toxic (12.5 to 25
µg/ml) or only kill a fraction of cells (50 µg/ml, see below),
LTX-315 was clearly enriched in the mitochondrial as
opposed to the cytosolic fraction (Figure 1C), supporting
the notion that this amphipathic cationic peptide readily
reaches its target organelle. Accordingly, LTX-315
caused a close-to-immediate cessation of mitochondrial
respiration when added to cells at concentrations ranging
from 30 µg/ml to 300 µg/ml (Figure 2A). This effect
was even more abrupt than the one obtained with high
doses (10-30 µM) of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide
m-chlorophenyl hydrazine (CCCP) (Figure 2B). As
compared to CCCP, which increased respiration at low
doses (0.3 to 1 µM), low doses of LTX-315 (0.3 µg/ml to
10 µg/ml) failed to stimulate oxygen consumption (Figure
2A, 2B, Supplemental Figure 1), indicating that LTX-315
is devoid of any uncoupling effect. When added to U2OS
osteosarcoma cells at variable concentrations (12.5 to 200
µg/ml) and intervals (6 to 24 h), LTX-315 was found to
kill close-to all cells at doses ≥100 µg/ml and to mediate
partial cytotoxic effects at 25 to 50 µg/ml, meaning that
cells bearing a close-to-normal morphology (with Hoechst
33342-detectable chromatin and a phalloidin-FITCreactive F-actin cytoskeleton) were still detectable (Figure
2B, 2C). In contrast, LTX-315 only mediated significant
erythrocyte lysis at doses >200 µg/ml (Supplemental
Figure 2), supporting the idea that direct detergent-like
effects on the plasma membrane are unlikely to explain
the cytotoxic action of LTX-315. In addition, LTX-315
disrupted the tubular mitochondrial network (labeled
by stable transfection with a mitochondrion-located red
fluorescent protein, RFP) in still intact cells, causing
its fragmentation. This effect, which was measured by
fluorescence microscopy and morphometric analysis, was
particularly pronounced at short time points (Figure 2B,
2D), supporting the mitochondriotoxic action of LTX-315.

Mitochondrial permeabilization by LTX-315
Cells exposed to doses of LTX-315 ranging
from 50 to 200 µg/ml exhibited the dissipation of
the inner mitochondrial transmembrane potential
(∆ψm), as detectable with the ∆ψm-sensitive dye
chloromethyltetramethylrosamine
(CMTMRos),
a
cationic lipophilic fluorochrome that incorporated into
the mitochondrial matrix driven by the Nernst equation
[21, 22]. This LTX-315 effect was comparable to the ∆ψm
dissipation mediated by the protonophore CCCP or the
pro-apoptotic pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor staurosporine
(STS) (Figure 3). Since ∆ψm dissipation is often associated
with the permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial
membrane [23, 24], we next investigated whether LTX315 can liberate intermembrane proteins such as SMAC
and cytochrome c from mitochondria. Indeed, LTX-315
caused the mitochondrial release of a SMAC-GFP fusion
protein stably expressed by U2OS cells, meaning that

fusion protein. TFAM is a matrix protein interacting
with mitochondrial DNA [25]. In contrast to SMACGFP or cytochrome c, the granular TFAM staining did

persistence of remnants of the mitochondrial structure that
retain TFAM.

treated two different double-knockout cell lines (human
colon carcinoma HCT116 cells and mouse embryonic
fibroblasts, MEF) that lacked both BAX and BAK with
LTX-315, comparing the efficiency of cell killing to wild
type cells that express BAX and BAK [27, 28]. Although
the absence of both BAX and BAK reduced cell killing
(measured by staining with the vital dye 4′,6-diamidino-2phenylindole, DAPI, plus the ∆ψm-sensitive fluorochrome
3,3′-dihexyloxacarbocyanine iodide, DiOC6(3)) to some
extent in response to 50-100 µg/ml LTX, cells lacking
BAX and BAK still died in response to high doses of
LTX (200 µg/ml) (Figure 6C). Altogether, these results
suggest that multidomain proteins from the BCL-2 family
contribute to LTX-mediated killing.

Impact of BCL-2 family proteins on LTX-315induced cell killing
U2OS cells stably transfected with a BAX-GFP
fusion protein usually express this fluorescent biosensor
in a diffuse location. However, upon induction of
apoptosis (with STS) or treatment with the uncoupler
CCCP, BAX-GFP aggregates in dense perinuclear areas
that likely correspond to mitochondria [26]. LTX-315 was
far less efficient in inducing such BAX-GFP aggregates
than were STS or CCCP, and only few such effects were
found for the intermediate dose of LTX-315 (50 µg/ml)
that caused partial cell killing (Figure 6A, 6B). Next, we

of LTX-315 to induce mitophagy, we measured the
colocalization of an RFP-LC3B fusion protein (which
decorates autophagosomes and autophagolysosomes)
[32] with mitochondria detected with the ∆Ψm-insensitive
dye MitoTracker green (MTG). CCCP, which is a strong
inducer of mitophagy [30, 33], caused a major colocalization of RFP-LC3B and MTG. In contrast, LTX315 largely failed to induce such an effect. Only at 24
h, moderately cytotoxic doses (50 µg/ml) of LTX-315
were able to cause a modest mitochondrial localization of
RFP-LC3B (Figure 7A, 7B). Mitophagy is accompanied
by the translocation of the ubiquitin ligase Parkin from
the cytosol to mitochondria [33, 34]. To measure this
phenomenon, we generated U2OS cells stably expressing
a mCherry-Parkin fusion protein. Short-term treatment (6
h) with CCCP stimulated a significant degree of mCherryParkin translocation to mitochondria, which was not found
with LTX-315 in the same time range. In contrast, longer
treatment (24 h) with low to moderate doses of LTX (12.5
to 50 µg/ml) could induce a minor, though significant
degree of mitochondrial relocation of mCherry-Parkin
(Figure 7C, 7D). Altogether, these results suggest that
LTX-315 can induce a modest degree of autophagy that
becomes detectable upon long-term exposure (24 h) to the
drug.

enrichment of the peptide in the mitochondrial fraction
of LTX-315-treated cells; (ii) the capacity of LTX-315
to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation; (iii) the ability of
LTX-315 to cause mitochondrial fragmentation; (iv)
the dissipation of the ∆ψm induced by LTX-315; (v) the
permeabilization of the outer mitochondrial membrane
causing the release of SMAC and cytochrome c. All
these effects were observed at an LTX-315 dose that was
either subtoxic (12.5-25 µg/ml) or partially toxic (50
µg/ml), within cells that otherwise beared a still normal
morphology. In addition, two functional manipulations
support the idea that LTX-315 kills cells through a
mitochondrial mechanisms, namely, (i) the fact that
removal of the pro-apoptotic multidomain proteins of the
BCL-2 family, BAX and BAK confered protection against
LTX-315, and (ii) that depletion of mitochondria by
mitophagy reduced LTX-315-mediated cell killing as well.
This cytoprotective effect of BAX/BAK or mitochondrial
removal was observed at LTX-315 doses of 50-100 µg/ml,
which are well below those mediating plasma membrane
permeabilization studied in erythrocytes (which lack
organelles).
In contrast to the prototype apoptosis inducer
staurosporine, LTX-315 is a rather poor inducer of the
translocation of BAX-GFP aggregation. Nonetheless we
found that LTX-315 was able to induce the formation
of BAX-GFP aggregates in at least some cells before
they died and that the removal of BAX and of its sessile
mitochondrial homologue BAK protects against LTX-315
mediated killing. At present, it remains elusive whether
BAK is activated by LTX-315 or whether alternatively,
BAX is activated in a transient (‘hit and run’) fashion,
as this has been previously suggested [35, 36], meaning
that its aggregation becomes not detectable (or perhaps is
prevented by the mitochondrion-permeabilizing effect of
LTX-315).
While there is little doubt that LTX-315 kills cells
secondary to its effects on mitochondria, it is still elusive
how the permeabilization of this organelle relays to cell
death induction. Indeed, LTX-315 failed to induce the
activation of caspase-3 (unpublished data), failed to induce
chromatin condensation (as compared to the pro-apoptotic
agent staurosporin, Figure 2B, 3A, 4A etc.) and hence did
not stimulate an apoptotic death program. In addition,
classical experimental interventions designed to block
regulated necrosis (such as addition of the RIP kinase
inhibitor necrostatin-1 or the cyclophilin D inhibitor
cyclosporine A, which inhibits mitochondrial permeability
transition) also failed to block LTX-315-induced killing
(unpublished data).
High doses of CCCP, which blocked mitochondrial
respiration as does LTX-315, yet failed to induce outer
mitochondrial membrane permeabilization, had no rapid
cytotoxic activity, suggesting that blockade of respiration
mediated by LTX-315 is not sufficient to cause cell killing.
The comparison of CCCP and LTX-315 reveals interesting

Removal of mitochondria reduced cell killing by
LTX-315
When U2OS cells stably expressing the mCherryParkin fusion protein were cultured for a protracted
period (48 h) with a high dose of CCCP (10 µM), the
cells lost part of the immunoblot-detectable expression
of the outer mitochondrial protein TOMM20 as well as
that of the intermembrane protein cytochrome c (Figure
8A, 8B), suggesting that a significant proportion of the
cells are depleted from mitochondria [33]. In a next
step, we comparatively assessed the cytotoxic effects
of control U2OS cells expressing mCherry-Parkin with
mitochondrion-depleted cells (due to pre-treatment with
CCCP for 24 h). Importantly, mitochondrion-depleted
cells were relatively resistant to the cytotoxic action of
LTX-315. In contrast, there was no difference between
mitochondrion-positive and mitochondrion-depleted
cells with respect to the cytotoxic action of the plasma
membrane-permeabilizing agent digitoxin (Figure 8C).
These results lend strong support to the idea that LTX-315
kills cancer cells via its mitochondrial effects.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The present data indicate that LTX-315 stimulates
cell death via its capacity to induce mitochondrial
membrane permeabilization. This idea is supported by
several levels of correlative evidence, namely (i) the

particularities of the two distinct mitochondrial toxins.
At low doses, CCCP causes mitochondrial uncoupling
(and hence an increase in oxygen consumption that can
be blocked by respiratory inhibitors), while LTX-315
is unable to do so. CCCP also stimulates massive and
rapid mitophagy, which is not the case for LTX-315.
Whether the particular mechanism through which LTX315 permeabilizes (and hence destroys) mitochondrial
membranes causes active subversion of the mitophagic
pathway remains to be determined.
In conclusion, LTX-315 is an agent that kills cells by
distributing to their mitochondria, causing functional and
morphological disruption of the organelle, as well as the
loss of the barrier functions of mitochondrial membranes.
Hence, LTX-315 exemplifies a mitochondrion-targeted
oncolytic agent.

Subcellular fractionation
Ten x 103 U2OS cells were seeded in 145 mm
cellstar culture dishes (Greiner Bio-One) and allowed
to adapt for 24 h. Thereafter the cells were treated with
LTX-315 and incubated for additional 6 h before being
harvested. Therefore the cells were rinsed with ice cold
PBS (pH 7.4) and 3 dishes per condition were collected
with a cell scraper in harvesting buffer (PBS, pH 7.4; 1
mM HEPES; 1 mM EDTA). Cells were washed once and
the pellet was resuspended in harvesting buffer, subjected
to 10 min incubation on ice, and subsequently grinded 100
times on ice using a dounce homogenizer and centrifuged
at 700 g for 10 min. The supernatant was recovered and
centrifuged at 10000 g for 30 min to obtain the cytosolic
fraction (from the supernatant). The pellet was further
washed with ice cold PBS and centrifuged 5 min at 450
g. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 1
mL of cold isolation buffer B (75 mM sucrose; 20 mM
Hepes; 225 mM mannitol; 0.5 mM EDTA, pH 7.2),
placed on ice and grinded 100 times using a dounce
homogenizer and following centrifuged at 750 g for 20
min. The supernatant was re-centrifuged at 10000 g for 10
min to obtain the mitochondrial fraction. The purity of the
fractions was analyzed by immunobloting. For detection
by mass spectrometry the supernatant of the cytosolic
fraction was centrifuged at 10000 g for 1 min at 4°C and
40 µl of supernatant were mixed with 2 µl of formic acid
(Sigma Aldrich). The pellet of the mitochondrial fraction
was solubilized in 100 µl of water and 40 µl of solution
were mixed with 2 µl of formic acid (Sigma Aldrich).
The global protein content of each fraction was assessed
using the DC protein assay kit from BioRad Laboratories

Data processing and statistical analyses

(Hercules, CA, USA) following the manufacture’s
recommendations.

Unless otherwise specified, experiments were
performed in triplicate parallel instances and repeated at
least once, and data were analyzed with the R software
(http://www.r-project.org/). Microscopy images were
segmented and analyzed by means of the MetaXpress
(Molecular Devices) software and numerical data was
further processed with R. Unless otherwise specified,
data are presented as means ± SD. Significances have
been evaluated using an unpaired Welch’s t test to rectify
possible differences in sample variances. Thresholds for
the minimum number of events in each analysis necessary
to apply further statistics were calculated based on a
medium effect size (according to Cohen’s conventional
criteria) using the pwr package for R with a targeted value
of 0.95. Samples that did not match the requirements were
marked ND and were excluded from the analysis.

Immunoblotting
Immunoblotting was performed following standard
procedures. Briefly, 10 µg of protein were separated on
NuPAGE Novex Bis-Tris 4-12 % pre-cast gels (InvitrogenLife Technologies (Carlsbad, CA, USA)) and transferred to
Immobilon polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (MerckMillipore, Darmstadt; Germany). Unspecific binding was
minimized by blocking the membranes for 1 h in 0.05 %
Tween 20 (v/v in TBS) supplemented with 5 % w/v bovine
serum albumin (Euromedex, Souffelweyersheim, France).
Thereafter, membranes were probed with antibodies
specific for TOMM20 (Abcam). Primary antibodies were
revealed with suitable immunoglobulin G conjugated to
horseradish peroxidase (Southern Biotech, Birmingham,
AL, USA), followed by chemiluminescence detection with
the SuperSignal West Pico reagent in a ImageQuant 4000
(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).

Cell death assays
Five x 103 human MEF or HCT116 cells were
seeded in 96-well cell culture plates and allowed to
adapt for 24 h, then maintained in control conditions or
exposed to LTX-315 for 6 or 24 h. For flow cytometry,
culture supernatants were transferred to V shaped 96 well
plates and cells were detached with 30 µL TrypsinLE™
Express per well, then resuspended in 30 µL of medium
and joined with the supernatant in the V-shaped 96 well.
The cells were centrifuged 5 min at 200 g and the pellet
was resuspended in medium supplemented with 40 nM
DiOC6(3) and 2 μM DAPI (all from Molecular Probes®Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and incubated
for 30 min at 37 °C before acquisition. Cytofluorometric
acquisition was performed on a CyanADP (BeckmanCoulter).

Targeted analysis of intracellular metabolites by
UHPLC coupled to a triple quadrupole (QQQ)
mass spectrometer
Targeted analysis was performed on a RRLC
1260 system (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn,
Germany) coupled to a Triple Quadrupole 6410 (Agilent
Technologies) equipped with an electrospray source
operating in positive mode. The capillary voltage was
set at 4.5 kV and the gas temperature at 350°C, with a
gas flow of 12 l/min. 5 μL of sample were injected on
a Column Zorbax Eclipse plus C18 (100 mm x 2.1 mm,
particle size 1.8 μm) from Agilent technologies and
heated at 40°C. The mobile phase consisted of water 0.2
% acetic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B), with a flow rate set
to 0.3 mL/min and initial 90 % phase A and 10 % phase
B. Gradient changed as follows: initial conditions were
maintained during 1.4 min. Molecules were then eluted
using a gradient from 10 % to 95 % phase B over 0.6 min.
The column was washed using 95 % mobile phase B for
2.5 minutes and equilibrated using 10 % mobile phase B
for 2.75 min. The needle was rinsed with 50 % acetonitrile
in water (v/v). The autosampler was kept at 4°C.
MRM transitions were as follows (all in positive
mode):

Analysis of mitochondrial metabolism
Cellular respiration was measured using the XF96 analyzer (Seahorse Bioscience, North Billerica, MA,
USA). Mitochondrial bioenergetic assays were performed
according to manufacurer’s instructions. The XF assay
medium (Seahorse Bioscience) was supplemented with 4
mM L-glutamine, 1 mM pyruvate, and 1 g/l D-glucose and
pH was adjusted with 1 M NaOH to 7.4 at 37°C. Fifteen
x 103 cells were seeded per well and allowed to adapt for

24 h to obtain a monolayer of cells before measurement.
After measuring basal respiration the Lytix compounds
were injected and a mitochondrial respiration test was
performed by sequential additions of 1 μM oligomycin,
0.5 μM carbonyl cyanide-4- (trifluoromethoxy)
phenylhydrazone (FCCP) and 1 μM rotenone and
antimycin A. Proton leak-induced respiration was
calculated as the difference between respiration achieved
after oligomycin addition and non-mitochondrial oxygen
consumption following rotenone-antimycin A treatment.
Maximal respiration induced by FCCP uncoupler was
corrected by subtracting the non-mitochondrial respiration
values. Subsequently the cells were fixed with 3.7 % of
PFA supplemented with 1 μM Hoechst 33342 for 20 min.
PFA was substituted with PBS and whole-well imaging
was performed by means of an ImageXpress micro XL
automated bioimager (Molecular Devices) equipped
with a PlanApo 2X/0.1 NA objective (Nikon) followed
by enumeration of cells using the MetaXpress software
(Molecular devices).

diluted in 2 % BSA in PBS shaking over night at 4°C.
The cells were rinsed twice and stained with AlexaFluorcoupled secondary antibodies for 1 h at RT, rinsed twice
and subjected to imaging using an ImageXpress micro
XL automated bioimager (Molecular Devices) equipped
with a PlanApo 20X/0.75 NA objective (Nikon). For
some of the assays cells were additionally stained with
200 nM MitoTracker green or MitoTracker orange (Life
Technologies), 1 ug/mL FITC-coupled Phalloidin before
imaging.

Mitophagy induction
U2OS cells stably expressing PARKIN-mCherry
were treated with 10 μM of CCCP for 48 h for the
induction of mitophagy. Thereafter cells were washed
and treated with LTX-315 for additional 6 or 24 h.
Decreased mitochondrial content was verified by
mitochondria-specific anti-TOMM20 or anti-cytochrome
c immunostaining.
