Abstract
Prostate cancer progression requires active androgen receptor (AR) signaling which occurs following
translocation of AR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Chemotherapy with taxanes improves survival in
patients with castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Taxanes induce microtubule stabilization, mitotic
arrest, and apoptotic cell death, but recent data suggest that taxanes can also affect AR signaling. Here,
we report that taxanes inhibit ligand-induced AR nuclear translocation and downstream transcriptional
activation of AR target genes such as prostate-specific antigen. AR nuclear translocation was not inhibited in
cells with acquired b-tubulin mutations that prevent taxane-induced microtubule stabilization, confirming a
role for microtubules in AR trafficking. Upon ligand activation, AR associated with the minus-end-microtubule
motor dynein, thereby trafficking on microtubules to translocate to the nucleus. Analysis of circulating
tumor cells (CTC) isolated from the peripheral blood of CRPC patients receiving taxane chemotherapy
revealed a significant correlation between AR cytoplasmic sequestration and clinical response to therapy.
These results indicate that taxanes act in CRPC patients at least in part by inhibiting AR nuclear transport and
signaling. Further, they suggest that monitoring AR subcellular localization in the CTCs of CRPC patients might
predict clinical responses to taxane chemotherapy. Cancer Res; 71(18); 6019–29. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PC) is the most commonly diagnosed
cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death
in men in the United States. In PC, growth and disease
progression requires active androgen receptor (AR) signaling, which occurs following translocation of AR from the
cytoplasm to the nucleus where AR, acting as a transcription
factor, binds to and activates AR-target genes (1–3). Continued AR signaling remains essential to PC progression
following androgen withdrawal (castration), with recent

data suggesting that intratumoral androgen synthesis stimulates PC growth in patients with castrate resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC; ref. 4). Agents that target the AR
signaling axis in patients with CRPC have recently shown
significant clinical activity in patients with CRPC (5), corroborating the importance of AR as a therapeutic target in
CRPC patients.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been used to treat patients
with advanced PC for more than 20 years (6). However, the
taxanes represent the only class of chemotherapy agents
showed to improve survival of patients with metastatic
CRPC; docetaxel (DTX) and recently cabazitaxel are the
standard for CRPC treatment (7–9). At the cellular level,
taxanes bind b-tubulin and stabilize the microtubule cytoskeleton which, in actively dividing cells leads to mitotic
arrest and apoptotic cell death (10). However, in contrast to
cancer cells cultured in vitro, cancer cells in patients often
display very slow doubling times (11, 12), suggesting that
the clinical activity of taxanes cannot be attributed solely
to their antimitotic effects and that it is important to
understand the functional consequences of taxane-induced
microtubule stabilization in cells during interphase (13).
Accordingly, we have previously shown that dynamic interphase microtubules regulate the intracellular transport
and activity of 2 other transcription factors, p53 and HIF1a (14–17). A number of recent reports by us and others

suggest that taxane chemotherapy can inhibit AR signaling
in PC cells (18–20). Here, we define the mechanisms of
taxane inhibition of AR and propose AR localization in
PC circulating tumor cells (CTC) as a predictor of
response/resistance to taxane chemotherapy in patients
with CRPC.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture and antibodies
The PC cell lines LNCaP, PC3, and PC3/AR were derived and
maintained as previously described (21–23). The PC3/
mCherry-tubulin cell line was generated in our laboratory
by stably transfecting PC3 PC cells with pcDNA3:mCherrytubulin plasmid which was a generous gift from the laboratory
of Dr. Tsien (UCSD, CA) and selecting transfected cells with
200 mg/mL neomycin (G418). The following antibodies were
used for immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting:
rabbit polyclonal anti-AR (N-20) and goat polyclonal antiprostate–specific antigen (PSA; C-19) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., mouse monoclonal anti-prostate–specific
membrane antigen (PSMA) J591 (24, 25), rat monoclonal anti
a-tubulin was from Novus Biologicals, mouse monoclonal
anti-c-myc was from Oncogene Research Products, mouse
monoclonal antibody against dynein intermediate chain
(IC74) was from Covance. All the Alexa-conjugated secondary
antibodies were from Molecular probes. NLP-005 Methyltrienolone (R1881) was purchased from Perkin-Elmer. Paclitaxel
(PTX) and DTX were from Sigma.
Determination of secreted PSA levels
LNCaP cells were cultured on 6-well plates and treated
overnight with either DTX at the indicated concentrations or
the di-hydroxytestosterone (DHT) analogue, R1881, at 10
nmol/L for 1 hour or the combination of R1881 treatment
following incubation with DTX. Supernatant were diluted 1:10
with Abbott Laboratories free and total PSA specimen diluent.
Secreted PSA level measurements were made on Abbott
Diagnostics IMx MEIA system as previously described (18).
Measurement of PSA-luciferase activity
LNCaP cells were transiently cotransfected with a dualluciferase reporter assay system in which luciferase is under
the control of a promoter containing androgen-responsive
elements (ARE-Luciferase) from the PSA gene (Promega Corp.;
ref. 26) and pRL-TK-luc, Renilla luciferase reporter construct
(kindly provided by P. Vertino, Emory University, Atlanta, GA),
upon reaching 60% confluency on 6-well plates. Thirty hours
posttransfection cells were incubated overnight with either
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; vehicle control) or taxanes (PTX
or DTX) at the indicated concentrations followed by 1 hour
treatment with R1881 at either 1 nmol/L or 10 nmol/L
concentration. Cells were harvested and cell lysates were
prepared for luciferase assays. Each transfection experiment
was done in triplicate. Results represent an average of at least
3 independent biological repeats with data presented as
relative PSA luciferase activity normalized to Renilla luciferase
values.

Establishment of 1A9 cancer cell lines overexpressing AR
The parental ovarian cancer cells 1A9 and their derived
b-tubulin mutant, PTX-insensitive clone PTX10 (27) were transfected with a pFLAG-hAR plasmid using lipofectamine (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were
selected using G418 (300 mg/mL) and AR-expressing clones
(as verified by Western blot analysis) were named 1A9/AR
and PTX10/AR cells, respectively. To evaluate AR trafficking
to the nucleus, 1A9/AR and PTX10/AR cells were plated on celltak–coated coverslips in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf
serum and switched to medium containing 10% charcoal
stripped serum (CS) for 72 hours. Following treatments without
(control) or with (i) DHT (100 nmol/L) for 2 hours; or (ii) PTX
(100 nmol/L) for 2 hours, followed by DHT (100 nmol/L) for
2 hours, cells were fixed with PHEMO buffer (16) and immunostained using antibodies against AR (PG21, Millipore, 1:200) and
a-tubulin (1:1000) followed by Alexa 647 (1:1000) and Alexa 568
(1:500) secondary antibodies, and DAPI staining.
Western blotting and immunoprecipitation
Control untreated and treated cells were lysed in TNES
buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris (pH 7.5) 100 mmol/L NaCl, 2
mmol/L EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, and a 1X protease inhibitor
mixture (Roche Applied Science). For the immunoprecipitation experiments, 0.5 mg of soluble cell extract was immunoprecipitated with either a rat a-tubulin or a mouse antibody
directed against dynein intermediate chain (IC74) and their
respective IgG controls, using protein-G plus agarose (Calbiochem) as recommended by the manufacturer. Immunoprecipitated proteins and 50 mg of total cell extracts were resolved
by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted for the indicated
proteins. Immunoblots were analyzed with the Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR).
Dynamitin overexpression
For the dynamitin overexpression experiments, LNCaP and
PC3/AR cells were plated on 12 mm glass coverslips (Electron
Microscopy Sciences) and transiently transfected with
c-myc-tagged pCMVH50m plasmid containing dynamitin, a
kind gift from R. Vallee (Columbia University, New York, NY;
ref. 28). All transfections were done using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) according to the
manufacturer's recommendations. C-myc-dynamitin transfected cells were processed for immunofluorescence labeling
using the following primary antibodies: anti-AR rabbit polyclonal and an anti-c-Myc mouse monoclonal. The secondary
antibodies used were Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit
immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:500) and Alexa 568-conjugated
goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500). Cells were then analyzed by
confocal microscopy.
Microtubule cosedimentation assay
LNCaP cells were lysed in low salt buffer (LSB; 20 mmol/L
Tris, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 2 mmol/L EGTA, 0.5% NP-40 and 1X
cocktail protease inhibitors). Twenty microliter of MAP-rich
bovine brain tubulin (5 mg/mL; Cytoskeleton) was supplemented with 1 mmol/L GTP and 2.5 mL cushion buffer consisting
of PEM buffer (80 mmol/L PIPES, 1 mmol/L MgCl2, 1 mmol/L

EGTA) in 50% glycerol and allow to polymerized at 35 C for 20
minutes. Microtubules were diluted in 200 mL warm PEM plus
20 mmol/L PTX and kept at room temperature. Alternatively,
MAP-rich tubulin was kept on ice and supplemented with PEM
buffer plus 20 mmol/L colchicine to prevent microtubule
polymerization. Twenty microliters of either microtubules or
tubulin dimers were incubated with 50 mg of LNCaP total cell
extracts for 30 minutes at 35 C or 4 C, respectively. Samples
were loaded into 100 mL cushion buffer and microtubules were
pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000 g at room temperature in
an airfuge (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). The warm supernatant
(WS) or cold supernatant (CS) were separated and the warm
(WP) or cold pellet (CP) were resuspended in an equal volume
of PEM buffer. Thirty-five microliters from each fraction were
loaded in a 10% SDS-PAGE and Western blotting was done with
antibodies against AR (1:200 dilution) and a-tubulin (clone
YL1/2, 1:5,000 dilution).
Live cell recording of AR nuclear translocation
For the analysis of GFP-AR trafficking in PC3-mCherrytubulin cells, PC3-mcherry-tubulin cells were plated on 35 mm
MatTek dishes and microinjected with full-length GFP-AR.
The cells were grown in complete RPMI media and switched
to phenol-red free media supplemented with 5% charcoalstripped medium for up to 3 hours before imaging. Cells were
transferred to a live-cell chamber and maintained at 37 C and
5% CO2 using the Tokai Hit Temperature control unit INUG2ZILCS. The AR ligand R1881 was added to the cells using a
Tokait Hit perfusion pipe/tube set with Luer lock syringe. Live
cell imaging was done by acquiring 0.5 mm Z-sections through
the entire cell depth at each time point using a Zeiss confocal
microscope fitted with a Spinning Disk unit manufactured by
Yokogawa Electric Corporation and run with the Axiovision
software. Images were acquired using the 488 laser to monitor
GFP-AR subcellular localization. Simultaneous imaging of
both the GFP-AR and mCherry-tubulin fluorophores was
not possible due to the low photostability of the mCherry
fluorophore. Therefore, mCherry-tubulin was imaged once at
the end of each recording to reveal the pattern of the microtubule cytoskeleton. Representative fields were selected and
images (z-stacks) were acquired at 10 minute intervals for
a total of 2 hours. Maximum intensity projections were made
with the Axiovision software, AxioVision files were saved
as 16-bit images and exported to MetaMorph image analysis software. Background subtraction was done using the
mean pixel value of a noncell region on each image with
the statistical correction function in MetaMorph and a sum
projection was assembled from the images recorded at 10 minutes intervals. High-intensity pixels in noncellular regions or
regions not of interest were also scaled out. Nuclear versus
cytoplasmic AR values were obtained using integrated pixel
intensity values from the sum projection and the percentage
of nuclear AR was calculated using the following formula:
% Nuclear AR ¼ 100  Nuclear AR/Total AR.
Venous blood collection and isolation of CTCs
Following approval of the Weill Cornell Institutional Review
Board (IRB), 10 mL of peripheral blood was collected, in

www.aacrjournals.org

sodium citrate tubes (BD), from CRPC patients at various
time points during taxane chemotherapy. CTCs were then
isolated using the epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)based immunomagnetic capture CellSearch system as per the
manufacturer's instructions (29). This enrichment step greatly
facilitated our analysis as CTCs are very rare (1 in 106 PBMCs)
and require specialized technology for their detection. CellSearch has been the first and only FDA-approved CTC detection technology utilized for clinical prognosis. Following
the isolation/enrichment step with the CellTracks AutoPrep
System, captured CTCs were cytospun onto cell-tak-(BD
Biosciences)-coated coverslips and processed for immunofluorescence staining. For our analysis, we conducted only the
first step of enrichment and omitted the second step of
automated staining with cytokeratins, DAPI and CD45 which
is used for CTC enumeration. In addition, to ensure analysis of
PC CTCs among the leucocytes present in the EpCAMenriched cell population, we stained for PSMA (prostate
specific marker) and CD45 (leucocyte specific marker) and
analyzed the PSMAþ/CD45 cells for AR subcellular localization using multiplex confocal microscopy. Using this
methodology, we monitored longitudinally CRPC patients
receiving taxane-chemotherapy and investigated the association between AR subcellular localization in CTCs and
patients’ clinical response to therapy.
In parallel, CTCs were also identified following Ficoll separation of blood collected in Vacutainer Cell Preparation Tube
with Sodium Heparin (BD). The PBMC layer containing CTCs
was collected and washed in 1X PBS. Hemolysis was done using
ammonium chloride buffer (150 mmol/L NH4Cl, 10 mmol/L
NaHCO3, 1 mmol/L Na2EDTA, pH adjusted to 7.3). Cells were
counted by Bright-Line hemacytometer (Hausser Scientific)
and approximately 1  106 cells were plated on cell-tak–coated
8-mm glass coverslips (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in 48well plates, cytospun and allowed to attach. Subsequent to
attachment, cells were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy as described below.
Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy
Following treatment and attachment, the cells, including
PBMCs were fixed and processed for immunofluorescence
labeling (16). The following antibodies were used: rabbit
polyclonal anti-AR, mouse monoclonal anti-PSMA (J591)
and rat monoclonal anti a-tubulin. The secondary antibodies
used were Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; 1:500), Alexa 568-conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (1:500) and Alexa 647-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG (1:500).
DNA was stained with 1 mg mL1 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Sigma). The cells were mounted using Mowiol
(Calbiochem) and imaged using a Zeiss LSM 5 LIVE confocal
microscope using 63/1.4 Plan APOCHROMAT and 100/1.4
Plan APOCHROMAT objectives. All images were acquired and
analyzed using Zeiss LSM 5 LIVE software.
Quantitation of AR subcellular localization in CTCs
CTCs were obtained by CellSearch enrichment or Ficoll
separation for each patient at each time point. CTCs were
imaged with a Zeiss 5 LIVE confocal microscope using a 20

AR localization in the nucleus with the patients’ clinical
response to treatment assessed using PSA working group 2
criteria. Considering the longitudinal nature of the data, the
association between the AR measurements and the PSA
outcome was more rigorously assessed using the generalized

objective. A single plane image of each cell was taken and
analyzed using the MetaMorph imaging software (Molecular
Devices). The nuclear region of the CTC was identified by DAPI
staining. Total cellular AR fluorescence intensity was measured
and the amount of AR fluorescence inside the nuclear region
was determined, allowing us to calculate the percentage of AR
in the cytoplasm and the nucleus of each CTC. The total
number of CTCs analyzed varied among patients, ranging from
3 to 27 CTCs per patient per time point. When possible we
analyzed at least 10 CTCs per patient per time point.

Statistical analysis
For CTCs isolated from the 14 patients, we determined both
the AR subcellular localization and total AR fluorescence
intensity at each patient visit. AR localization was defined
as follows: if greater than 50% of CTCs in a given sample have a
meaningful percentage of AR in cytoplasm (>40%), we considered AR localization as cytoplasmic, otherwise, we considered AR localization as nuclear. Patients’ data with clear PSA

Microtubule stabilization is a prerequisite for taxaneinduced inhibition of AR signaling
To determine whether the taxane-induced cytoplasmic
sequestration of AR required prior microtubule stabilization,
we utilized an isogenic model of PTX-sensitive and -resistant
human ovarian cancer cells, 1A9 and 1A9/PTX10, respectively,
stably transfected with wild-type GFP-AR. Drug resistance in
1A9/PTX10 cells is conferred by an acquired tubulin mutation
(Fb270V) at PTX's binding site (27). PTX treatment of taxaneresistant 1A9/PTX10 cells had no effect on GFP-AR subcellular
localization (Fig. 3, right panel; consistent with the drug's
inability to stabilize microtubules), whereas DHT-induced
GFP-AR nuclear accumulation was robustly inhibited by
PTX in parental drug-sensitive 1A9 cells (Fig. 3, left panel).
These results showed that the microtubule stabilizing activity
of taxanes is required to inhibit AR translocation and downstream signaling; further implying that in cases where the
drug-target interaction is impaired AR signaling will remain
unaffected. To further characterize the interaction of AR with
microtubules, we conducted high resolution multiplex confocal microscopy in PC3 cells stably expressing AR, and
observed a clear colocalization of cytoplasmic AR with intact
microtubules. Following taxane treatment AR remained associated with bundled microtubules in the perinuclear region
(Fig. 4A). The tubulin-AR association was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation of tubulin and AR in LNCaP cells (Fig. 4B)
as well as by a microtubule cosedimentation assay (14) in
which AR was found preferentially associated with the microtubule polymer fraction (WP) and not the fraction contain-

nuclear accumulation by confocal microscopy. Interestingly,
PTX induced a significant decrease in AR nuclear accumulation, at both baseline and following R1881 treatment (Fig. 1A–
C). Quantitation of the extent of PTX-induced AR nuclear
exclusion revealed a significant decrease in the percentage of
cells with nuclear AR, following R1881 treatment, from 70% to
<30% (Fig. 1B; P < 0.001) and a concomitant 50% decrease in
the total fluorescence intensity of nuclear AR staining (Fig. 1C;
P < 0.001). The profound cytoplasmic sequestration of AR
following PTX treatment implicated microtubules in the
shuttling of the receptor from the cytoplasm to the nucleus.
To explore the dynamics of ligand induced AR nuclear translocation, we introduced full-length GFP-AR into PC3 cells
stably expressing mCherry tubulin (PC3:mCherry-tub;
Fig. 1D and time lapse confocal microscopy recordings available as Supplementary Movies S1 and S2). PTX treatment
significantly reduced the extent and the rate of AR nuclear
accumulation in cells with stabilized microtubules as early as
30 minutes post-R1881 addition (P < 0.01–0.001). Consistent
with drug-induced AR nuclear exclusion, we also observed
dose-dependent inhibition of AR transcriptional activity using
a luciferase reporter assay in LNCaP cells expressing endogenous AR (Fig. 2A). Similarly, DTX treatment inhibited ligandinduced protein expression (Fig. 2B) and secretion of PSA;
Fig. 2C), an AR target gene used clinically to monitor biochemical disease progression in men with PC (18, 33). Together, these results suggested that taxanes inhibit AR
signaling by preventing AR nuclear accumulation.

role of microtubules as tracks for AR transport toward the
nucleus (Fig. 4C).
The microtubule-associated motor protein, dynein,
mediates AR trafficking
To test this hypothesis, we investigated the involvement of
the minus-end-directed microtubule-motor protein dynein,

depolymerization the AR-microtubule cofractionation decreased accordingly. HSS, high speed supernatant; WP, warm pellet; WS, warm supernatant;

AR cytoplasmic localization in CTCs correlates with
clinical response to taxane chemotherapy
To assess whether taxanes inhibit AR nuclear translocation
in vivo, we isolated CTCs from the blood of CRPC patients and
examined PSMA (24, 25, 35, 36) expressing CTCs by high
resolution confocal microscopy. We first confirmed colocalization of AR with the microtubule cytoskeleton in patient
samples (Fig. 6A). We next investigated whether perturbation
of the microtubule-AR axis in CTCs identified in CRPC
patients receiving taxane chemotherapy would correlate with
clinical response. As shown in Figure 6B (top panel), CTCs
from a patient who was refractory to PTX chemotherapy
exhibited an unperturbed microtubule network with AR present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, in a second
patient who was responding to DTX chemotherapy, CTCs
showed bundled microtubules and AR was exclusively in the
cytoplasm with intense AR perinuclear staining (Fig. 6B,
bottom panel). These results in 2 patients suggested that
taxane-induced microtubule bundling and AR cytoplasmic

www.aacrjournals.org

localization correlated with clinical response to chemotherapy. We therefore expanded our analysis to additional patients
and used CTCs enriched from the blood of CRPC patients
using EpCAM-based immunomagnetic capture (CellSearch;
ref. 29). To identify PC CTCs among the leucocytes present in
the EpCAM-enriched cell population, we stained for PSMA
and CD45 (leucocyte specific marker) and analyzed the
PSMAþ/CD45 cells for AR subcellular localization using
multiplex confocal microscopy (Fig. 6C). Using this methodology, we monitored longitudinally CRPC patients receiving
taxane-chemotherapy and investigated the association between AR's subcellular localization in CTCs and patients’
clinical response to therapy. Figure 6D shows a representative
example of CTCs isolated from a metastatic CRPC patient in
which AR was localized in the nucleus at baseline, consistent
with this patient's rising serum PSA (Fig. 6E, open symbols),
but was consistently shifted to the cytoplasm during PSA
decline following chemotherapy (Figs. 6D and E). In another
patient (Fig. 6E, filled symbols), AR was detected in the
cytoplasm as early as 1 hour following PTX administration
which was followed by a significant decline in PSA. This result
emphasizes fast and effective drug-target engagement in this
patient's sample.
Table 1 summarizes the results from our CTC analyses done
on sequential blood samples obtained from 14 patients receiving taxane chemotherapy and followed longitudinally. PSA
outcomes were assigned by clinicians independent of CTC
enumeration using modified Prostate Cancer Working Group
2 criteria (33). Responders were defined as having at least a
30% reduction in PSA (33, 37, 38); progressors had more than
25% increase in PSA with a minimum absolute increase of 2
ng/mL and those meeting neither criteria were considered
stable. Among 18 samples obtained during clinical progression, 13 (72%) showed nuclear AR localization; while among 17
responding/stable samples, 12 (70.6%) showed cytoplasmic
AR localization (P ¼ 0.02; Table 1). We also examined the
association between longitudinal quantitative AR measurements (either in terms of the percentage of AR in cytoplasm or
the total AR intensity) and the PSA outcome using a generalized linear mixed-effects model that accounts for possible
clustering of data among cells from the same sample and
among samples from the same subject. This analysis revealed
that the odds of responding for those with AR completely in
cytoplasm was estimated to be increased by 30% compared
with patients with no AR in the cytoplasm (OR ¼ exp(0.26) ¼
1.30, P < 0.001). Similarly, using log transformed total AR
intensity as the predictor, we found that increased total AR
intensity is associated with decreased odds of responding.
With each unit increase in the log AR intensity, the odds of
responding is 24% lower (OR ¼ exp(0.28) ¼ 0.76, P < 0.001).
Interestingly, we observed AR nuclear localization in all 4
baseline patient samples indicative of active AR signaling. In
contrast, AR cytoplasmic localization was detected as early as
1 hour following the first dose of PTX administration (patient
4) showcasing rapid and effective perturbation of the microtubule-AR axis. Altogether, these results show that AR subcellular localization can be resolved in CTCs and can serve as a
biomarker to monitor clinical response to chemotherapy.

patients receiving taxane-based therapy. Blood was drawn and serum PSA was measured at the indicated time points. CTCs were isolated and
stained for AR, tubulin, and DAPI as in (D) to determine AR subcellular localization. Ovals and diamonds on the graph represent the AR nuclear localization
(cytoplasmic and nuclear, respectively) determined in CTCs isolated at these precise time points. For patient 11, evaluation of CTCs at baseline
showed the presence of AR in the nucleus. Following treatment, CTC analysis revealed a shift of AR to the cytoplasm, consistent with the decrease in
PSA. CTCs from patient 4 showed cytoplasmic AR during PSA response to taxane. However, CTCs subsequently showed AR nuclear localization
before PSA progression was apparent.

Discussion
PC remains a major cause of cancer-related morbidity in the
United States with the majority of PC-related deaths resulting
from metastatic, castrate-resistant disease. Widely thought to
be chemotherapy resistant (6), androgen withdrawal was
considered the only effective therapy for patients who developed metastases. Although numerous clinical studies using
taxane-based regimens had shown antitumor activity and
clinical benefit in patients with CRPC, it was only in 2004
that the taxane DTX was proven to significantly improve
overall survival (8, 9). In 2010, the taxane cabazitaxel was
shown to improve overall survival in CRPC patients who had
received prior DTX chemotherapy (7). These studies have
proven the clinical utility of taxanes in PC.
Historically, the antitumor activity of taxanes has been
attributed to inhibition of mitosis, as mitotic cell division

6026

Cancer Res; 71(18) September 15, 2011

requires the presence of highly dynamic microtubules and
taxane treatment by suppressing microtubule dynamics leads
to mitotic arrest in actively dividing cancer cells growing on 2dimensional tissue culture (10). In addition to mitosis, microtubule dynamics are critically important for many interphase cellular functions such as intracellular transport and
signaling, the disruption of which by taxanes has not been
functionally implicated in their antitumor activity (39). Here,
we provide evidence that taxanes clinical activity in PC can be
attributed at least in part to the inhibition of AR activity via its
effect on microtubules. Inhibition of AR signaling as effective
therapy in the castrate state has similarly been observed with
agents designed to specifically target the AR axis, including the
androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone and the novel AR
antagonist MDV3100 (5). The observation that DTX may also
act by inhibiting AR through microtubule stabilization may
explain why taxanes are the only class of active chemotherapy

Previous reports have shown that taxanes can inhibit PSA

inhibition of AR-transactivated genes is mediated by FOXO1
(19), whereas Zhu and colleagues similarly suggested that
taxanes effect on microtubules inhibits AR nuclear localization (20). These results together with the data presented here

strongly suggest that interphase microtubule functions coupled with the trafficking and signaling pathways they regulate
are indeed the effective targets of taxane treatment. In the
current study, we show that in cells with tubulin mutation at
the PTX-binding site treatment with PTX does not prevent AR
nuclear localization suggesting that tubulin mutations at the
taxane-binding site may account for clinical taxane resistance.
This mechanism could also explain the lack of clinical crossresistance between the different taxanes as we have previously
reported that cancer cell lines that are resistant to PTX due to
acquired b-tubulin mutations at the taxane-binding site retain
sensitivity to DTX or other microtubule-stabilizing drugs that
bind tubulin at the same site, such as the epothilones (27, 40,
41). This is attributed to the distinct-binding modes of PTX,
DTX, or the epothilones in the same-binding site in b-tubulin
so that single point mutations may affect one taxane but not
the other even though the binding site is shared (42). Alternatively, AR gene alterations rendering AR trafficking independent of microtubule control could also lead to taxane
resistance.
The lack of readily biopsied tumor material from metastatic
CRPC patients represents an additional challenge to the
understanding of clinical drug resistance. Circulating tumor
cells isolated from the blood of metastatic cancer patients
provide a noninvasive source of tumor material that can
enable molecular characterization of disease progression.
Previous studies have identified PC-specific molecular alterations in CTCs such as AR gene amplification, PTEN loss and
TMPRSS2:ERG fusion confirming the malignant origin of
CTCs (43–45). However, no studies have directly monitored
CTCs for drug-induced dynamic changes in molecular pathways in individual patients over time. Using isolated CTCs
from CRPC patients followed longitudinally over the course of
taxane chemotherapy, we found a significant correlation
between AR cytoplasmic localization and clinical response,
suggesting that the changes in AR subcellular localization can
be used as a predictive biomarker of response. We also
detected a decrease in AR intensity. The correlation between
the decrease in total AR intensity and clinical response to
taxanes is consistent with AR transcriptional autoregulation
(46) and our results showing that taxane treatment leads to AR

cytoplasmic sequestration and subsequent inhibition of transcriptional activity (Fig. 1). These results showing that disruption of the microtubule-AR axis contributes to taxane
antitumor activity also suggest that combining a taxane with
other therapies targeting AR signaling at the level of ligand
synthesis (47) or ligand-receptor interaction or DNA transactivation (48) may be synergistic.
Whether studying the effect of a taxane on AR localization
in CTCs can be used as predictor of clinical response to
therapy requires further study. To this end, we have begun
a prospective clinical trial of CRPC patients receiving DTX
chemotherapy to determine if AR localization following chemotherapy correlates with response, and whether tubulin
and/or AR mutations correlate with DTX resistance. The
ability to monitor these events in CTCs over the course of
a patient's treatment will enable early therapeutic interventions and help elucidate the mechanisms of drug resistance in
CRPC patients.
