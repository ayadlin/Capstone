Abstract
Cisplatin [cis-diaminodichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP)] is one of
the most widely used and effective therapeutic agents for
many kinds of cancers. However, its efficiency is limited due to
development of drug resistance. In this study, we showed that
CDDP resistance was associated with AKT1 overexpression
and gene amplification in human lung cancer cells that
acquired the drug resistance. We showed that AKT1 forced
expression in the cells was sufficient to render the cells CDDP
resistant, and that AKT1 inhibition by its dominant negative
mutant reversed the CDDP-resistant cells to be CDDP
sensitive. These results show that AKT1 activity is essential
for regulating CDDP resistance in cultured lung cancer cells.
To study whether these results were correlated with human
lung cancer tumors, we randomly selected tumor samples
from human lung cancer patients to study the correlation of
AKT activation and CDDP resistance in clinical tumor
samples. We showed that AKT activation was highly related
to CDDP chemosensitivity in human tumor tissues. Our results
further showed that AKT1 induced lung cancer cells to become
resistant to CDDP through the mammalian target of the
rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. These studies conclude
that AKT amplification and the mTOR pathway play an
important role in human lung cancer cells acquiring CDDP
resistance, which represents a new mechanism for acquiring
CDDP resistance and a potential novel therapeutic target for
overcoming CDDP resistance in human cancer in the future.

Introduction
Lung cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer worldwide and is
the leading cause of cancer death in men and the second leading
cause in women (1, 2). Non–small-cell lung cancer is the most
common type of lung cancer, accounting for 75% to 80% of all lung
cancer occurrences (3). cis-Diaminodichloroplatinum (II) (CDDP;
cisplatin) is one of the most effective and widely used DNAdamaging anticancer drugs used for the treatment of various
human cancers including lung cancer (4). However, the ability of
cancer cells to become resistant to CDDP remains a significant
impediment to successful chemotherapy. Intensive studies have
been done to clarify the mechanisms of CDDP resistance. Up to
now, multiple mechanisms have been proposed in CDDP resistance,

including reduction of platinum accumulation related to the
alteration of transmembrane pumps, increase of thiol-containing
biomolecules such as glutathione and metallothioneins, enhancement of the DNA damage repair, and blockade of apoptosis
induction (5–7). A better understanding of the processes and
mechanisms leading to CDDP resistance of non–small-cell lung
cancer is necessary to develop effective therapies that can improve
the prognosis of patients with this deadly disease.
Serine-threonine kinase AKT transmits survival signals from
growth factors and regulates metabolism, cell cycle progression,
and cellular survival (8–11). AKT is the cellular homologue of the
product of the r-akt oncogene and has three isoforms: AKT1, AKT2,
and AKT3 (12–14). Previous studies indicate that dysregulation of
AKT is a prominent feature of many human cancers including non–
small-cell lung cancer (15). The AKT pathway plays an important
role in survival when cancer cells are exposed to different kinds of
apoptotic stimuli, such as the withdrawal of extracellular signaling
factors, oxidative and osmotic stress, irradiation, matrix adhesion,
ischemic shock, and chemotherapeutic drugs (16–21). Recent
studies have shown that AKT activation seems to be related to
CDDP resistance of ovarian cancer cells (22, 23). To study the
mechanism of CDDP in this study, we have established a human
lung cancer line, A549/CDDP, resistant to CDDP treatment. We
found that the CDDP-resistant cells show greatly increased AKT1
expression and gene amplification when compared with its parental
cell line A549. We further showed that AKT1 activation is essential
to the CDDP resistance in cancer cells. Similar results were found in
tumor samples from human lung cancer patients. Our findings
identify a new mechanism of CDDP resistance in human lung
cancer cells through AKT1 amplification and the mammalian target
of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. This study may provide useful
information to develop a potential new therapeutic approach for
lung cancer patients by targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway to
overcome CDDP resistance.

Materials and Methods
Cell culture. Human non–small-cell lung cancer A549 cells (American
Type Culture Collection) were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 units/mL penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL
streptomycin in a 37jC CO2 incubator. Cells were selected by stepwise
exposure to increasing CDDP concentrations up to 5 Ag/mL. Then, the cells
were maintained at least for 6 months in the medium containing 5 Ag/mL
CDDP. The CDDP-resistant cells were cultured without CDDP for 1 month
before the analysis was done.
Reagents. Antibodies against h-actin, CDDP, LY294002, and rapamycin
were purchased from Sigma. CDDP, LY294002, and rapamycin were
dissolved in DMSO and stored at 20jC. Antibodies against phosphorylated
AKT (Ser473), total AKT, and phosphorylated p70S6K1 (Thr421/Ser424) were

obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Antibodies against total p70S6K1
were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Lipofectamine and TRIzol reagent
were from Invitrogen. Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit and moloney
murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase were from Promega.
DNA Marker, Taq polymerase, and oligo(dT)18 were from TaKaRa. Adeno-X
Rapid Titer Kit was from BD Biosciences Clontech.
Patients and surgically resected tissues and primary culture. The
study set consisted of 45 primary human lung cancer samples taken from
patients undergoing surgery in Xinqiao Hospital and Southwest Hospital of
the Third Military Medical University, China, from January 2001 to May
2002. Written informed consent was received from each patient before the
experiment. The clinical data included age, sex, date of diagnosis, histology,
and smoking history. Tissue blocks from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
lung cancer specimens were cut into f5-Am sections, fixed on glass slides,
and shipped to our laboratory for further processing. Part of the tissues was
used to obtain primary cell culture for testing the sensitivity to CDDP
treatment by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) assay as previously described (24). In brief, part of the lung cancer
tissues from operation was immersed in D-Hanks solution with antibiotics;
after being washed several times, tissues were cut into <1 mm3 sections.
After the removal of red cells by hypotonic method, tumor tissues were
treated by collagenase digestion and density gradient centrifugation to
obtain the primary cancer cell suspension. The cells were seeded into
96-well plates. After culture for 24 h, various concentrations of CDDP were
added and incubated for 48 h. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay.
Only 27 of diagnostic lung cancer samples which had results of phosphoAKT staining and chemosensitivity were included in our data analysis.
Adenovirus preparation and transduction efficiency. The construction of constitutively active AKT (Myr-AKT) and dominant-negative AKT
(AKT-K179M) has previously been described (25). Recombinant adenoviruses were made using the AdEasy system (26). Briefly, the constructs were
subcloned into the shuttle vector pAdTrack-CMV, then transferred to
AdEasy-1 plasmid through homologous recombination as previously
described (26). The viral vectors were then transfected into 293 cells
to generate viruses. A control virus carrying the green fluorescent protein
(Ad-GFP) was derived from the same vector system. Viral titres were
determined using the BD Adeno-X Rapid Titer Kit per manufacturer’s
instructions. Adenoviral transduction efficiency for the cell lines was
determined using the Ad-GFP vector. A549 and A549/CDDP cells were
infected with Ad-Myr-AKT1 and Ad-AKT-DN at 10 and 30 multiplicities of
infection (MOI), respectively.
MTT assay. Cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 3  103 per well
overnight and incubated with different concentrations of CDDP from 0 to
32 Amol/L with six replicate wells per treatment. For the cultured primary
lung cancer cells, cells were seeded into 96-well plates at 7.5  103 per well
and treated with six different concentrations of CDDP from 0 to 660 Amol/L
(0, 6.6, 13.2, 66, 132, and 660 Amol/L). All measurements were done in
triplicate wells. After culture for 48 h, MTT dye solution was added to each
well and samples were incubated at 37jC for 4 h. The formazan product
was dissolved by adding 100 AL of DMSO to each well and the plates
were read at 570 nm. Each treatment included six wells and the results
were calculated from three independent experiments. The IC50 value was
calculated from the 50% formazan formation compared with a control
without the addition of CDDP.
RNA isolation and reverse transcription-PCR. Total RNAs were
extracted from the cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to
the manufacturer’s instruction. Two micrograms of total RNA were used
for cDNA synthesis using MMLV reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT)18 as
primer. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) analysis was done using the
cDNAs as the template. PCR was amplified for less than 30 cycles. Levels
of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) or h-actin were
used as the internal control. Primers for the PCR analysis were as follows:
AKT1, 5¶-GGAGGACAATGACTACGGC-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TCATCTTGGTCAGGTGGTGT-3¶ (antisense); GAPDH, 5¶-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3¶
(antisense); and h-actin, 5¶-CCTTCCTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCCTG-3¶
(sense) and 5¶-GGAGCAATGATCTTGACTTC-3¶ (antisense).

Genomic DNA isolation and analysis. Genomic DNA was isolated from
A549 and A549/CDDP cells using Wizard Genomic DNA Purification
Kit (Promega). Primers for PCR were as follows: AKT1, 5¶-AAGGACTGTAGGAGTGGACGAT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-CAGCGGATGATGAAGGTGTT-3¶
(antisense); GAPDH, 5¶-GGAGTCCACTGGCGTCTT-3¶ (sense) and 5¶-TGATGATCTTGAGGCTGTTGT-3¶ (antisense).
In vivo studies. All animal experiments were conducted with the
approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Shanghai
Institutes for Biological Sciences. Tumors were developed by s.c. injection of
2  106 cancer cells into both flanks of athymic nude mice at 4 weeks of age.
When the diameters of tumors were >5 mm, the mice were treated by i.p.
injection of 4 mg/kg CDDP once a week for 3 weeks. Nude mice were
divided into the following groups: A549 cells treated with solvent; A549 cells
treated with LY294002; A549/CDDP cells treated with solvent; and A549/
CDDP cells treated with LY294002. Each group contained five mice with
treatment of LY294002 at 25 mg/kg or an equal volume of solvent by i.p.
injection twice a week for 3 weeks at the same time. Bidimensional tumor
measurements were analyzed with calipers thrice a week; the mice were
euthanized on day 20 after drug treatment. Tumor volume was calculated
according to the formula (width2  length) / 2.
Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analysis. Immunoblotting was done as previously described (27, 28). The signals were detected
with horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham). Human tumor tissues were
embedded in paraffin and cut into 5-Am sections onto glass slides. The
pathologic types of lung cancer were determined by the Department of
Pathology of Southwest Hospital. After antigen retrieval, sections were
stained for the expression of phospho-AKT (1:50), detected by streptavidinbiotin-horseradish peroxidase complex formation. Tumor sections stained
by immunoglobulin G instead of primary antibodies were used as negative
control.
For the analysis of phospho-AKT levels, tumors were scored as previously
described. Briefly, it was analyzed as follows: , negative (no staining); +,
weak homogeneous cytoplasmic staining without a granular staining
pattern; ++, strong granular cytoplasmic staining in <20% of tumor cells;
and +++, strong granular cytoplasmic staining in >20% of tumor cells (29).
Statistical analysis. All values in the present study were reported as
mean F SE. Student’s unpaired t test was used for analyzing the two pairs of
data in the experiments. ANOVA was used for comparing the data with
more than two treatments in the experiments. Nonparametric approach
(Kruskal-Wallis test) was done to test the relationship between the levels of
phospho-AKT staining and IC50 values. Differences between values were
considered significant at P < 0.05.

Results and Discussion
CDDP-resistant lung cancer cells show AKT1 overexpression
and gene amplification. To study the molecular mechanism of
CDDP resistance, we established CDDP-resistant cells, A549/CDDP
cells from A549 human lung cancer cells, by stepwise exposure
to increasing concentrations of CDDP. As shown in Fig. 1A, the
IC50 concentration of A549/CDDP cells was f4-fold that of A549
(30.74 versus 8.11 Amol/L) when the cells were treated with CDDP.
To test what signaling molecules are involved in CDDP resistance,
we found that levels of phospho-AKT and total AKT expression
were 2-fold that of the control, which suggested that AKT
activation and overexpression are associated with CDDP resistance
in the cells (Fig. 1B). To study how AKT protein expression was
induced in CDDP-resistant cells, we found that AKT1 steady-state
mRNA level was increased f2-fold in the cells, which correlated
with the elevation of AKT protein level in A549/CDDP cells
(Fig. 1C). It is known that AKT includes AKT1, AKT2, and AKT3
isoforms that are expressed in various tissues and cancer cells (30).
We found that AKT2 and AKT3 mRNA levels were not induced in
A549/CDDP cells (data not showed). To determine whether

increased AKT1 mRNA level was due to AKT1 gene amplification,
genomic DNA was isolated from A549 and A549/CDDP cells and
analyzed by PCR. There have been a few reports of AKT gene
amplification being related to carcinogenesis. For example, AKT1
gene amplification has been detected in a single gastric carcinoma
and glioblastoma (31, 32) and AKT2 gene amplification has been
reported in ovarian, pancreatic, and breast cancers (33, 34).
Overexpression of AKT3 mRNA was identified in breast and
prostate cancers (35). Recent study has indicated that AKT2 is
involved in CDDP resistance in ovarian cancer cells (36). We found
that AKT1 gene was amplified 2-fold in A549/CDDP cells when
compared with A549 cells (Fig. 1D). This result shows that AKT1
gene amplification is a new mechanism of CDDP resistance in
human lung cancer cells that are developed by CDDP selection and
colonial expansion.
AKT1 expression is sufficient and necessary for regulating
CDDP resistance in cancer cells. To determine whether direct
expression of AKT1 in the cells is sufficient to induce CDDP
resistance, A549 cells were infected with adenovirus carrying GFP
or a constitutive active form of AKT1 (Myr-AKT1). The effect of
CDDP on cell proliferation was analyzed. AKT1 forced expression
decreased the sensitivity of A549 cells to CDDP treatment with a

www.aacrjournals.org

2.5-fold increase of IC50 when compared with the control (Fig. 2A).
To further confirm the effect of AKT1 overexpression in other
cancer cells, human prostate cancer DU145 cells were used.
Overexpression of AKT1 in DU145 cells also induced CDDP
resistance in the cells with a 2-fold induction of IC50 (Fig. 2B).
These results indicated that AKT1 expression was sufficient to
render DU145 cells CDDP resistant. To study whether AKT is
required for A549/CDDP cells to become CDDP resistant, A549/
CDDP cells were infected with adenovirus carrying AKT1 dominant
negative mutant. The expression of AKT1 dominant negative
mutant reversed the CDDP resistance to sensitivity with a 2-fold
decrease of IC50 value with CDDP treatment (Fig. 2C), showing that
AKT1 is required for the CDDP-resistant A549/CDDP cells to
become CDDP resistant. Human ovarian cancer A2780 cells show
amplification of PI3KCA, which codes for phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K), an upstream molecule of AKT. To test whether
AKT1 is required for the CDDP resistance in other cancer cells,
A2780 cells were infected with adenovirus carrying GFP or AKT1
dominant negative mutant. Similarly, the expression of AKT1
dominant negative mutant in A2780 cells made the cells
susceptible to CDDP treatment with a decrease of IC50 from
15.63 to 8.65 Amol/L (Fig. 2D). Taken together, these results suggest

that AKT1 activity is sufficient and essential for regulating CDDP
resistance in human cancer cells.
AKT activation in human lung tumor tissues correlated with
the CDDP resistance of tumor cells. To study whether AKT
activation is correlated with CDDP resistance in human lung
cancer tissues, we collected 27 primary human lung tumors from
the surgery. Parts of the tumors were embedded in paraffin, and
sections were stained for immunohistochemical studies using
phospho-AKT antibodies; the other parts were used for the
preparation of primary human lung cancer cells. The sensitivity
of primary lung cancer cells to CDDP treatment was analyzed with
the MTT assay. The relative intensity of phospho-AKT signals in the
tumor tissues was scored from
(negative, no staining) to +++
(strong granular cytoplasmic staining in >20% of tumor cells;
Fig. 3). The levels of phospho-AKT signals in human lung tumor
tissues were highly related to CDDP resistance in primary lung
cancer cells (Table 1), suggesting that AKT activation regulated
CDDP resistance in human lung tumor tissues and cells in vivo.
This result is consistent with the data obtained from A549 and

A549/CDDP cells as described above. Elevated AKT activity was
also detected in different kinds of human cancers that were
associated with a poor prognosis (37–39). This indicates that AKT
activation may be a common mechanism that could regulate CDDP
resistance in other human cancer cells.
AKT-mediated CDDP resistance depends on PI3K activity. To
test whether AKT-induced CDDP resistance depends on PI3K
activity, parental A549 cells and A549/CDDP cells were cultured in
the absence or presence of PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and treated
with different concentrations of CDDP. The addition of low
concentration of LY294002 greatly increases the sensitivity of A549/
CDDP cells inhibited by CDDP treatment (Fig. 4A). In contrast,
LY294002 treatment only slightly affected A549 cell proliferation
(Fig. 4B). This result showed that A549/CDDP cells were more
sensitive than A549 cells in response to LY294002 treatment and
that AKT-induced CDDP resistance still required PI3K activity in
the cells. This is consistent with AKT activation through
phosphorylation that depends on PI3K activity in the cells. To
analyze the AKT phosphorylation that correlates with AKT

Figure 2. AKT1 expression is sufficient and necessary for regulating the CDDP resistance in cancer cells. A549 (A) and DU145 (B) cells were infected with adenovirus
carrying Myr-AKT (Ad-Myr-AKT) at 10 MOI. Cells infected with Ad-GFP were used as a control. The cells were trypsinized and seeded into 96-well plates 24 h
after infection and analyzed for the sensitivity to CDDP treatment as described in Fig. 1. IC50 against cisplatin (CDDP) was calculated using the data from three
replicate experiments. The IC50 in A549 infected with Ad-GFP and Ad-Myr-AKT was 7.65 and 18.77 Amol/L, respectively (A). IC50 against CDDP in DU145 infected
with Ad-GFP and Ad-Myr-AKT was 6.97 and 12.76 Amol/L, respectively (B). A549/CDDP (C) and (D) A2780 cells were infected with adenovirus carrying AKT
dominant negative mutant (Ad-AKT-DN) at 30 MOI. Cells infected with Ad-GFP were used as a control. The cells were seeded into 96-well plates 24 h after infection
and analyzed for the sensitivity to CDDP treatment. Triplicate experiments were done. AKT1 inhibition by its dominant negative mutant (AKT-DN) enhanced the
chemotherapeutic effect of CDDP in both A549/CDDP and A2780 cells. IC50 value decreased from 32.05 to 16.74 Amol/L when AKT-DN was expressed in A549/CDDP
cells. IC50 value decreased from 15.63 to 8.65 Amol/L when AKT-DN was expressed in A2780 cells.

activation, A549 and A549/CDDP cells were cultured in serum-free
medium overnight, followed by the addition of CDDP and serum in
the absence or presence of LY294002. Similarly, the higher basal
levels of phospho-AKT and total AKT were observed in A549/CDDP
cells than in A549 cells as we previously described (Fig. 1B).
LY294002 and CDDP combination treatment decreased phosphoAKT to very low levels in both A549 and A549/CDDP cells (Fig. 4C).
The reduction rate of phospho-AKT levels in A549/CDDP cells was
much greater that that in A549 cells (Fig. 4C). These results were
consistent with the MTT assay, which showed that LY294002 and
CDDP combination treatment had much greater inhibition effect
on A549/CDDP cells than on A549 cells.
To study the effect of LY294002 on tumor growth in vivo, A549
and A549/CDDP cells were injected into nude mice to initiate the
tumor. When the diameter of tumors reached f5 mm, the mice
were treated with the combination of LY294002 and CDDP by i.p.
injection and tumor volumes were analyzed. CDDP treatment
alone did not inhibit tumor growth induced by A549/CDDP cells,
but the combination of CDDP and LY294002 induced the
regression of tumors to smaller size from their initial size when
the treatment was started (Fig. 4D), and the effect of LY294002
treatment in inhibiting A549/CDDP cell–induced tumor growth
was much greater than with A549 cell–induced tumor growth
(Fig. 4D and E). These results show that the lung cancer cells with
AKT amplification is hypersensitive to LY294002 and CDDP
combination treatment, suggesting that AKT-induced CDDP
resistance also requires PI3K activity in tumor xenografts.

mTOR and p70S6K1 are downstream targets of AKT1 in
mediating CDDP resistance. Serine/threonine kinase mTOR is
activated by AKT in response to growth factors (40). mTOR, in turn,
activated p70S6K1 through its phosphorylation. To test whether
mTOR is the downstream target of AKT in mediating AKT-induced
CDDP resistance, A549 and A549/CDDP cells were treated without
and with rapamycin. A549/CDDP cells have higher level of p70S6K1
phosphorylation than A549 cells, and rapamycin treatment
decreased p70S6K1 activation (Fig. 5A and B). This result indicated
that CDDP resistance is associated with mTOR and p70S6K1
activation in the cells. To determine whether activation of the
mTOR/p70S6K1 pathway is required for AKT-induced CDDP
resistance, the cells were treated with CDDP alone or the
combination of CDDP and rapamycin, and the IC50 for inhibiting
cell proliferation was measured. Rapamycin treatment slightly
decreased the IC50 than CDDP treatment alone in A549 cells
(Fig. 5D), whereas rapamycin addition decreased the IC50 to
f3-fold in A549/CDDP cells than CDDP treatment alone (Fig. 5C).
This result showed that mTOR and p70S6K1 activation is required
for AKT-induced CDDP resistance, suggesting that the mTOR/
p70S6K1 pathway is downstream of AKT in mediating CDDP
resistance in lung cancer cells.
It is still a major hurdle that cancer cells become resistant to
chemotherapeutic agents during treatment. CDDP resistance is
currently known to be associated with CDDP detoxification,
cellular drug transport, DNA replication and repair, and antiapoptosis pathways (6, 7). However, the molecular mechanisms of

Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay in three replicate experiments. B, LY294002 treatment only slightly increases the sensitivity of A549 cells to CDDP
treatment. A549 cells were treated with CDDP in the absence or presence of LY294002 as above. C, A549 and A549/CDDP cells were cultured in serum-free
medium for 20 h, switched to medium without serum ( ) or LY294002 ( ) or with 5% fetal bovine serum (+) and 10 Amol/L LY294002 (+) for 2 h. Total
cellular lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoblotting analysis with antibodies against p-AKT and total AKT. D, LY294002 treatment enhances the
effect of CDDP in inhibiting tumor growth induced by A549/CDDP cells. Nude mice were injected s.c. into both flanks with 2  106 A549/CDDP cells. When the
diameter of any tumor reached 5 mm, the mice were treated by i.p. injection of 4 mg/kg CDDP once a week for 3 successive weeks. At the same time,
mice were injected i.p. twice a week for 3 wks with equal volume of solvent or 25 mg/kg LY294002 as indicated. Each treatment group contained five mice.
The mice were euthanized on day 20 after drug treatment. Tumor volumes were measured by the width and length of tumors after the treatment. Points, mean
from 8 to 10 tumors, normalized to the tumor volume on the first day of the treatment; bars, SE. *, P < 0.01, tumor volumes significantly different when compared
with those of CDDP treatment alone. E, LY294002 only slightly increases the effect of CDDP in inhibiting tumor growth induced by A549 cells. Tumor growth
was induced by the injection of A549 cells. The mice were treated as described above. *, P < 0.01, tumor volumes significantly different when compared with
those of CDDP treatment alone.

AKT1 Amplication Regulates Cisplatin Resistance

Figure 5. The AKT/mTOR pathway was
involved in the chemosensitivity of A549
and A549/CDDP to CDDP treatment.
A, rapamycin inhibited phospho-p70S6K1
expression in a dose-dependent manner.
A549 and A549/CDDP cells were treated
with rapamycin (0, 5, 10, and 20 nmol/L)
for 2 h. Total cellular proteins were
extracted and analyzed by immunoblotting.
B, the intensity of phospho-p70S6K1
protein signals obtained was quantified
using Chem Doc densitometry
software (Quantity One, Bio-Rad)
from three replicate experiments. The
phospho-p70S6K1 densitometry signals
were normalized to those of total 70S6K1,
then normalized to those of untreated
A549 cells (100%). Columns, mean from
three independent experiments; bars, SE.
C, rapamycin enhanced the effect of
CDDP in inhibiting A549/CDDP cell
proliferation. A549/CDDP cells were
seeded into 96-well plates and treated as
described in Fig. 1, except the use of
rapamycin (0 and 10 nmol/L). Cell
proliferation was measured by MTT
assay, and IC50 was calculated using the
data from three replicate experiments.
D, rapamycin slightly increased the
effect of CDDP in inhibiting A549 cell
proliferation. A549 cells were treated to
study cell proliferation in the absence or
presence of CDDP and rapamycin as
described above.

its resistance remain to be identified. In this study, we showed that
AKT1 amplification was responsible for CDDP resistance in human
lung cancer cells, which represents a novel mechanism of CDDP
resistance in cancer cells. AKT is known to be a major
antiapoptotic signal in response to growth factors. AKT regulates
cell survival, proliferation, and protein synthesis (41–43). Our
results showed direct evidence that AKT1 was sufficient and
necessary in regulating CDDP resistance. Recent studies showed
that the PI3K/AKT pathway is related to chemoresistance mainly
through inhibition of cellular apoptosis (44–46). AKT activation has
been indicated to be correlated with chemoresistance (47, 48).
These results are consistent with our data showing that AKT1
amplification and activation are involved in CDDP resistance. We

resistance in primary cultured lung cancer cells and human tumor

clinical setting.
