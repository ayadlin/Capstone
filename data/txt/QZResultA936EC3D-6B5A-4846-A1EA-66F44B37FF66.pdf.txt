BACKGROUND: The optimal combination of fludarabine, busulfan, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) for reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) transplantation has not been established. ATG plays a pivotal role in the prevention of graft-versus-host disease (GvHD),
but it is associated with a higher relapse rate and an elevated incidence of infections when high doses are used. METHODS: The
authors retrospectively compared 2 different doses of ATG combined with fludarabine and busulfan in 229 adult patients who underwent transplantation at their institution. ATG was administered over 1 day (FBA1) or over 2 days (FBA2) at a daily dose of 2.5 mg/kg.
RESULTS: There were 124 patients in the FBA2 cohort and 105 patients in the FBA2 cohorts. Patients in the FBA2 cohort were older
and more frequently underwent transplantation from an unrelated donor; 93% of patients in the FBA2 cohort received intravenous
busulfan versus only 5% in the FBA1 cohort. The incidence of grade 2 through 4 acute GvHD was 23% in the FBA2 cohort versus 42%
in the FBA1 cohort (P ¼ .002); the incidence of grade 3 through 4 acute GvHD was 10% versus 23%, respectively (P ¼ .006); and the
incidence of chronic GvHD was 35% versus 69%, respectively (P < .0001). The 2-year rates of overall survival, nonrelapse mortality,
and relapse/progression for the FBA1 and FBA2 cohorts were 65% versus 67%, respectively (P ¼ .99), 20% versus 19%, respectively
(P ¼ .61), and 30% versus 19%, respectively (P ¼ .09). The results were confirmed in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The use of
ATG at a dose of 5 mg/kg was correlated significantly with reduced incidence and severity of GvHD without impairing disease control. Taken together, the current results suggest that this conditioning represents a step forward in the optimization of RIC. Cancer

INTRODUCTION
Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation performed after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC-AlloSCT) is an
alternative option for patients who are not fit for a myeloablative (MA) preparation.1-3 In this setting, the combination of
fludarabine, busulfan, and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) is widely used.1,4-6 It is known that ATG is effective in preventing graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)7-9; however, because of in vivo T-cell depletion, ATG is associated with a potential
risk of increasing the relapse probability10-12; therefore, titration of the dose is crucial.13,14 Whereas an ATG dose in the
range of 10 mg/kg appears to be associated with loss of disease control,4 we recently reported that a 2.5 mg/kg total dose
did not preclude patients presenting with high rates of severe acute GvHD (aGvHD) and chronic GvHD (cGvHD).15 An
intermediate dose of approximately 4.5 mg/kg reportedly delivers satisfactory GvHD prevention and antitumor
effects.16,17
Given these data, we decided to increase the dose of ATG in our recently reported conditioning regimen15 with the
objective of optimizing the prevention of potential complications and maintaining disease control. In the current report,
we retrospectively compare the outcome of 229 consecutive patients who received treatment at our center with 2 different
doses of ATG, 2.5 mg/kg (n ¼ 124 [the FBA1 cohort]) and 5 mg/kg (n ¼ 105 [the FBA2 cohort]), in combination with
5 to 6 days of fludarabine and 2 days of busulfan.

ATG and GvHD in RIC Transplantation/Crocchiolo et al

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Conditioning for the FBA1 cohort consisted of oral busulfan (1 mg/kg every 6 hours on days 4 and 3; Myleran,
GlaxoSmithKline, Marly-le-Roi, France), rabbit ATG
(2.5 mg/kg on day 3; Thymoglobuline; Genzyme, St.
Germain-en-Lay, France), and fludarabine (30 mg/m2
daily from day 6 or 5 to day 1; Fludara; Bayer Sante,
Puteaux, France). For patients in the FBA2 cohort, busulfan was mainly administered as an intravenous formulation (0.8 mg/kg every 6 hours on days 4 and 3;
Busilvex; Pierre Fabre, Boulogne-Billancourt, France) in
combination with 2 days of ATG (2.5 mg/kg daily on
days 2 and 1) and fludarabine as specified above.
GvHD prophylaxis was mainly realized by cyclosporine
alone, and supportive care was performed in accordance
with previously reported procedures.15 All patients with
hematologic malignancies who received the FBA1 or
FBA2 regimen between January 1, 2000 and January 30,
2010 were included in the study. Diseases were classified
according to the risk of relapse.18 Patients underwent
RIC-AlloSCT according to our institutional policy. All
donors were human leukemic antigen (HLA)-matched
(related or unrelated) or mismatched (unrelated with 1
HLA mismatch). The graft source was peripheral blood
stem cells harvested after the administration of granulocyte–colony-stimulating factor. This study was approved
by the Paoli-Calmettes Institute review board.
Statistical Analysis

The primary objective of the study was to assess the incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD with the newer FBA2 regimen. Other endpoints were overall survival (OS),
nonrelapse mortality (NRM), relapse, and progression.
Categorical variables are expressed as proportions,
and continuous variables are expressed as the median with
the respective range. Comparisons between groups were
performed with the chi-square and Mann-Whitney tests
for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Survival outcomes were calculated from the date of transplantation. NRM was defined as death without evidence of
disease progression or relapse, and death after disease progression was treated as a competing event in the NRM
analyses. The incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD was estimated considering disease progression or death as competing events. Patients without an event were censored at
their last contact date, except with respect to aGvHD incidence (day 100). The Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank
tests, and Cox proportional hazards models19,20 were used
for the OS analyses. Hazard ratios were estimated with
their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Prentice

estimation, the Gray test, and Fine and Gray models21,22
were used for the NRM, relapse/progression, and aGvHD
and cGvHD analyses. When investigating its impact on
survival outcomes, aGvHD was treated as a time-dependent covariate. Estimates are given at 2 years after transplantation, unless otherwise specified. aGvHD was
graded according to the criteria published by Glucksberg
et al,23 and cGvHD was classified as either limited or
extensive.24 A multivariate analysis was performed to
determine the impact of the conditioning regimen relative
to the main pretransplantation and peritransplantation
variables (patient and donor age and sex, diagnosis, disease
status at transplantation, comorbidities, year of AlloSCT,
donor type, total cell surface glycoprotein [cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)]-positive and T-cell coreceptor
[CD3]-positive counts infused with the graft). Models
were built when the ATG dose was associated with the
outcome of interest with a significance of P  .10 in univariate analysis. P values  .05 were considered significant. The statistical software packages SPSS version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, Ill) and R version 2.12.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) were
used for statistical analyses.

RESULTS
Data from 229 consecutive adult patients were entered
into the analysis of the 2 study cohorts: FBA1 and FBA2.
The median follow-up was 38 months (range, 3-108
months) for the patients who remained alive. Their primary characteristics are provided in Table 1. The 2
cohorts differed significantly in the length of observation
time, donor sex, and busulfan formulation. Moreover,
patients in the FBA2 cohort were significantly older,
received a graft with higher CD34-positive and lower
CD3-positive counts, and more frequently underwent
transplantation from an unrelated donor than patients in
the FBA1 cohort. Diagnoses were distributed equally
except for chronic myeloid leukemia, which was more frequent in the FBA1 cohort (P ¼ .02). No significant differences in disease risk were observed between the 2 cohorts:
low-risk, standard-risk, and high-risk diseases were distributed equally between the 2 groups (see Table 1).
The cumulative incidence of grade 2 through 4
aGvHD differed significantly between the 2 groups and
was 42% (95% CI, 33%-51%) in the FBA2 cohort and
23% (95% CI, 15%-31%) in the FBA2 cohort (P ¼
.002) (Fig. 1, top). This difference persisted when considering grade 3 through 4 aGvHD, for which the cumulative incidence was 23% (95% CI, 15%-30%) and 10%

Table 3 provides the adjusted hazard ratios for the
FBA2 versus FBA1 regimens for each outcome of interest,
confirming that the ATG dose was an independent predictor of the occurrence and severity of both aGvHD and
cGvHD, but it did not have any significant impact on
OS, NRM, or relapse/progression.
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective analysis of 2 sequential cohorts of
patients who received treatment over a 10-year period at a
single institution, we observed a significant reduction in
the incidence of aGvHD and cGvHD without loss of disease control after the introduction of 1 more day of ATG
in the conditioning regimen for RIC transplantation. We
recently reported our previous experience with an ATG
dose of 2.5 mg/kg15 in the context of RIC transplantation,
in which patient outcomes still were impaired by the
occurrence of long-lasting, extensive cGvHD; for this reason, we decided to modify the conditioning regimen by
adding 1 more day of ATG in an attempt to lower the
GvHD incidence. The results obtained from the current
study confirmed our hypothesis, because the incidence of
both aGvHD and cGvHD was significantly lower in the
FBA2 cohort. This is particularly notable because the
FBA2 cohort was both older and had a higher proportion
of unrelated donors.
Our results are in line with those reported in other
studies that aimed to identify the optimal ATG dose in
fludarabine/busulfan-based conditioning regimens.4,25-27

Hamadani et al,27 who observed a subsequent incidence
of grade 2 through 4 aGvHD, grade 3 and 4 aGvHD, and
cGvHD of 34%, 12%, and 48%, respectively. Mohty et
al4 analyzed the incidence of GvHD among 101 patients
who received different ATG doses (2.5-10 mg/kg) and
reported that aGvHD was correlated significantly with
ATG dose. A recent study25 reported incidences of grade
2 through 4 aGvHD, grade 3 and 4 aGvHD, and cGvHD
of 23%, 10%, and 45%, respectively, among 207 patients
who received a myeloablative conditioning regimen using
fludarabine plus busulfan and a total ATG dose of 4.5
mg/kg. Recently, Bashir et al28 compared a total ATG
dose of 4.5 mg/kg with a total dose of 7.5 mg/kg among
20 patients who underwent RIC-AlloSCT from unrelated
donors after a fludarabine-melphalan conditioning regimen. The treatment-related mortality in that study was
20% in the 4.5 mg/kg arm and 60% in the 7.5 mg/kg
arm, thus favoring the use of 4.5 mg/kg in patients undergoing RIC-AlloSCT from unrelated donors.
A large retrospective analysis recently questioned the
beneficial impact of ATG,29 indicating inferior outcomes
with T-cell depletion (anti-CD52 or ATG) compared
with non–T-cell depleted grafts; our results appear to contradict this finding, but it is likely that differences in ATG
dose and brand are responsible. In fact, in the Center for
Cancer

March 1, 2013

International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research
(CIBMTR) study,29 the median ATG dose was higher
than ours (7 mg/kg), and 27% of patients in that study
received horse ATG. Inferior disease-free survival in the
ATG group was mainly because of the high relapse incidence (49% vs 23% in our study), which may be
explained by the higher ATG dose used, although other
factors, such as busulfan dose (8 mg/kg), use of other alkylating agents during conditioning, and pretransplantation therapies, also may be evoked.
Caution is needed when interpreting NRM and
relapse results uniquely with regard to ATG dose
changes; indeed, we cannot exclude the contribution of
disease control and/or toxicity by the intravenous busulfan formulation, which was used mostly with the FBA2
regimen. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to analyze the ATG dose and busulfan formulation separately.
It is reasonable to speculate that less variability in the
pharmacokinetics associated with intravenous busulfan
may allow better disease control and less organ toxicity,
and this latter effect possibly may influence relapse/progression and NRM incidence; however, heterogeneity of
diseases makes any further interpretation difficult, especially with respect to relapse or progression. A singlecenter, matched-pair analysis16 and, more recently, a
long-term analysis of a prospective randomized trial30
and a retrospective registry-based analysis31 have confirmed that the addition of ATG does not increase the
incidence of relapse and, thus, does not affect OS or
progression-free survival.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate a reduced
incidence of both acute and chronic GvHD with the
FBA2 regimen compared with the FBA1 regimen, and
this reduction was not accompanied by a significantly
higher relapse incidence or by any significant differences
in other transplantation outcomes. The current data indicate that 5 mg/kg of ATG provides satisfactory T-cell
depletion in this type of RIC transplantation; the FBA2
regimen may be a platform for the development of strategies aimed at improving disease control, such as intensification of the busulfan dose in the conditioning regimen32
and/or the addition of post-transplantation therapeutics
in high-risk patients.33-35
