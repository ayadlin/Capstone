Abstract

Author Manuscript

The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade regulates various biological
functions, including cell growth, proliferation and survival. As such, this pathway is often
deregulated in cancer, including melanomas, which frequently harbour activating mutations in the
NRAS and BRAF oncogenes. Hyperactive MAPK signalling is known to promote protein
synthesis, but the mechanisms by which this occurs remain poorly understood. Here, we show that
expression of oncogenic forms of Ras and Raf promotes the constitutive activation of the
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Using pharmacological inhibitors and RNA interference
we find that the MAPK-activated protein kinase RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) is partly required
for these effects. Using melanoma cell lines carrying activating BRAF mutations we show that
ERK/RSK signalling regulates assembly of the translation initiation complex and polysome
formation, as well as the translation of growth-related mRNAs containing a 5’ terminal
oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif. Accordingly, we find that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour growth
in mice. Our findings indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of
tumours characterized by deregulated MAPK signalling, such as melanoma.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

The Ras/MAPK pathway promotes cell growth and proliferation by controlling the activity
of various transcription factors and cell cycle regulators (9). In addition, this pathway was
shown to stimulate protein synthesis (10, 11), but the molecular mechanisms involved in this
process remain poorly understood. The MAPK-activated protein kinases MNK1/2 were
found to phosphorylate the translation initiation factor eIF4E (12, 13), providing a potential
mechanism by which MAPK signalling regulates mRNA translation (reviewed in 14, 15).
However, the MNKs have been shown to be dispensable for global protein synthesis (16),
and may only regulate the translation of a specific subset of mRNAs (17). The p90
ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) family comprises four protein kinases that are directly
phosphorylated and activated by ERK1/2 (18). RSK regulates various substrates involved in
cell proliferation and survival (19-21), and was found to be hyperactivated in several types
of cancer (22), including melanoma (23). Increasing evidence indicates that ERK/RSK
signalling participates in the regulation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)(24,
25), providing an additional mechanism by which MAPK signaling regulates the
translational machinery (26).

The Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade regulates a wide
range of cellular functions, including cell growth, proliferation, and survival (1, 2). In this
pathway, ligand binding to growth factor receptors leads to activation of the small GTPase
Ras, which allows membrane recruitment and activation of the Raf protein kinases. Once
activated, Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2, which are dual-specificity kinases
capable of phosphorylating and activating the MAPKs ERK1/2. Hyperactivation of the
MAPK pathway is a highly prevalent event in human cancer and usually results from
aberrant activation of receptor tyrosine kinases or by gain-of-function mutations in Ras or
Raf isoforms (3). One prominent example is melanoma, where activating mutations in BRAF
or NRAS (in ~50% and ~15% of cases, respectively) are the earliest genotypic changes
observed (3-5). More than 90% of BRAF mutations encode a protein harbouring the V600E
mutation, which constitutively activates ERK1/2 signalling (6). Malignant melanoma is
highly resistant to conventional chemotherapy (7), but recently developed therapies that
target components of the MAPK pathway have demonstrated survival advantage in patients
with BRAF-mutated melanoma (8).

mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr kinase that plays essential roles in the
regulation of cell growth (27, 28). mTOR associates with different protein partners to form
two functionally distinct complexes, the rapamycin-sensitive and -insensitive mTOR
complex (mTORC) 1 and 2, respectively (3, 29, 30). mTORC1 positively regulates mRNA
translation by stimulating two main translational regulators, the eukaryotic translation
initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and the p70 ribosomal S6 kinases (S6K1 and S6K2) (26, 31).
While eIF4E promotes recruitment of the ribosome at the 5’ cap of mRNAs (32), activated
S6Ks phosphorylate proteins involved in pre-mRNA processing and ribosome biogenesis,
including the 40S ribosomal protein (rp) S6 (33). mTORC1 is frequently deregulated in
human cancer and its activation is often linked with mutations in components of the
phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway (34). In melanoma, increased mTORC1 activity

has been observed in ~70% of tumours (35), but it is currently unknown whether ERK/RSK
signalling contributes to this deregulation.
In this study, we demonstrate that oncogenic activation of the MAPK pathway promotes
constitutive mTORC1 activity and function. More specifically, we identify RSK as a key
MAPK substrate involved in the regulation of mTORC1 in melanoma. Inhibition of RSK
expression or activity results in decreased mTORC1 activity and function, as well as
reduced melanoma cell and tumour growth. Together, these data suggest that RSK may be a
valuable therapeutic target for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Oncogenic Ras and Raf promote mTORC1 signalling in an ERK/RSK-dependent manner

To examine the contribution of oncogenic MAPK signalling in the regulation of mTORC1,
we generated stable HEK293 cell lines expressing activated alleles of MEK1 (MEK-DD),
H-Ras (G12V) or B-Raf (V600E) (Fig. 1A). These cells were starved of serum overnight to
reduce basal mTORC1 activity resulting from growth factors present in serum. To monitor
mTORC1 activity, we have quantified several established mTORC1-dependent events, such
as S6K1 phosphorylation at its mTORC1-regulated site (Thr389), rpS6 phosphorylation at
S6K1-specific residues (Ser240/244), as well as the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated
endogenous S6K1. Using these three approaches, we found that all three cell lines displayed
constitutively high levels of mTORC1 activity (Fig. 1B, lane 1 of each panel), which were
sensitive to rapamycin treatment (Fig. 1B, lane 6 of each panel). To characterize the
involvement of the MAPK pathway, cells were pre-treated with inhibitors of MEK1/2
(U0126 or PD184352) or RSK (BI-D1870 or SL0101) for one hour prior to being harvested.
These inhibitors resulted in a robust decrease in mTORC1 activity (Fig. 1B), suggesting that
oncogenic ERK/RSK signalling contributes significantly to the regulation of mTORC1
activity. To measure mTORC1-dependent functions, we tested the effect of MEK1/2 and
RSK inhibitors on global protein synthesis. As expected, we found that oncogenic activation
of the MAPK pathway increased tritiated leucine incorporation compared to control cells
(Fig. 1C). Interestingly, we found that inhibition of ERK/RSK signalling significantly
suppressed global protein synthesis in all three cell lines (Fig. 1D). These reductions were
similar to those obtained with two mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and KU-0063794),
suggesting an important role for ERK/RSK signalling in global protein synthesis.
ERK/RSK signalling contributes to the constitutive activation of mTORC1 in melanoma

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the role of RSK in melanoma, we used four human melanoma cell lines
harbouring gain-of-function mutations in NRAS (WM852 and WM1361) or BRAF (Colo829
and A375)(Fig. 2A). These cells have constitutively high ERK/RSK activity compared to
normal human melanocytes (Fig. 2B), and are highly sensitive to MEK1/2 inhibitors
irrespective of their genotypes (Fig. S1A). Interestingly, these cells also display
constitutively high mTORC1 activity compared to serum-starved or insulin-treated normal
human melanocytes (Fig. 2B), suggesting the involvement of the MAPK pathway.
Consistent with this, we found that mTORC1 activity in melanoma cells was highly
sensitive to inhibitors of ERK/RSK signalling (Fig. 2C and 2D). This effect was not due to a

modulation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, as we did not detect variations in Akt phosphorylation
in serum-starved A375 cells treated with inhibitors at the same concentration (Fig. S1B).
While cells harbouring activating mutations in BRAF and NRAS were all sensitive to the
RSK inhibitors, it is noteworthy that MEK1/2 inhibition resulted in a weaker inhibitory
effect in NRAS cells.

Author Manuscript

To validate the requirement for RSK activity, we used RNA interference (RNAi) to
specifically silence RSK expression in melanoma cells. First, we determined the expression
levels of all RSK isoforms and found that RSK1 and RSK2 were the most abundant
isoforms at the mRNA level (Fig. 3A). To reduce RSK expression, we used two
complementary approaches using small interfering RNA (siRNA)- or short hairpin
(shRNA)-mediated RNAi. Using these approaches, we found that transient knockdown of
RSK1/2 expression in Colo829 cells resulted in a significant inhibition of mTORC1 activity
(Fig. S2). The role of the MAPK pathway was also verified using siRNA duplexes targeting
ERK1/2 expression, which resulted in a similar inhibitory effect (Fig. S2). We also
generated A375 and WM1361 stable cell lines expressing shRNAs targeting RSK1 and
RSK2. When these cells were serum-starved overnight, we found that RSK knockdown
significantly decreased mTORC1 activity (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained when
depleting RSK in other melanoma cell lines, such as WM852 and SK-MEL-2 (data not
shown). Together, these results demonstrate that endogenous RSK contributes to the
regulation of mTORC1 signalling in melanoma cells.
ERK/RSK signalling promotes mTORC1-mediated eIF4F assembly and mRNA translation
in melanoma

Next, we investigated whether ERK/RSK signalling regulates mTORC1-dependent protein
synthesis in melanoma. First, cells were serum-starved and treated with MEK1/2 or RSK
inhibitors prior to measuring tritiated leucine incorporation. Consistent with results from
HEK293 cells, we found that ERK/RSK signalling was required for global protein synthesis
in the four melanoma cell lines tested (Fig. 4A). To determine whether ERK/RSK signalling
regulates mRNA translation, we examined polysome assembly using sucrose gradient
sedimentation. Notably, we found that treatment of Colo829 cells with MEK1/2 or RSK
inhibitors significantly decreased polysome assembly and proportionally increased the
number of free ribosomes (Fig. 4B). Indeed, we found that inhibitor treatment reduced the
polysome/subpolysome (P/S) ratio by ~65% compared to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 4B and
S3), suggesting that ERK/RSK signalling plays a major role in regulating mRNA translation
in melanoma.

Author Manuscript

mTORC1 promotes mRNA translation by phosphorylating and inactivating the eIF4Ebinding proteins (4E-BPs), resulting in their dissociation from eIF4E and assembly of the
eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G and eIF4A). As with S6K1, we found that melanoma cells
display high levels of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (Fig. 2B and 4C), which reflects the
constitutively high mTORC1 activity found in these cells (Fig. 2). To determine the role of
ERK/RSK signalling in eIF4F assembly, we used 7-methylguanosine-conjugated sepharose
beads to purify eIF4E and associated proteins from Colo829 cells. Interestingly, we found
that treatment of cells with MEK1/2 or RSK inhibitors significantly increased the

association of hypophosphorylated 4E-BP1 to eIF4E (Fig. 4C), suggesting that oncogenic
ERK/RSK signalling promotes mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in
melanoma cells. We observed that MEK1/2 and RSK inhibition dramatically decreased 4EBP1 phosphorylation on three sites (Thr37/Thr46/Ser65) known to be regulated by
mTORC1 (Fig. 4C), suggesting that RSK promotes eIF4F formation through the control of
mTORC1-dependent 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Consistent with this, we found that MEK1/2
and RSK inhibition robustly reduced eIF4G recruitment to eIF4E. As expected, inhibition of
mTOR using KU-0063794 also reduced eIF4F complex formation, and as shown by others
(36), we found that rapamycin treatment was less efficient than KU-0063794 to inhibit
eIF4F formation (Fig. 4C). Together, these data demonstrate that ERK/RSK signalling plays
an important role in mTORC1-dependent translation initiation in melanoma cells.
ERK/RSK signalling promotes translation of growth-related mRNAs in melanoma

Next, we investigated the type of transcripts that were regulated by ERK/RSK signalling in
melanoma cells using a global microarray-based approach. We compared total and
polysome-bound RNAs to globally identify mRNAs that are actively being translated
(polysomal mRNA) and normalize their levels to their overall abundance in the cell (total
mRNA). Total and polysomal RNAs were extracted from Colo829 cells treated with
MEK1/2 (PD184352), RSK (BI-D1870) or mTORC1 (KU-0063794 and rapamycin)
inhibitors, and hybridized to human NimbleGen 60-mer oligonucleotides arrays. Cellular
treatments were limited to one hour to minimize potential transcriptional effects of these
drugs. Resulting data were analyzed and compared using several bioinformatics approaches
(as described in Materials and Methods), and a statistically significant (p < 0.05) cut-off
value of 1.5-fold (log2-coefficient=−0.58) decrease in the relative abundance of total or
polysomal mRNA upon inhibitor treatment was used to designate specific regulation.
Overall, the number of downregulated genes upon inhibition of the ERK/RSK pathway was
greater in the polysomal RNA fraction compared with total RNAs (Fig. S4A), consistent
with the idea that ERK/RSK signalling regulates mRNA translation (Fig. 4). As expected,
we observed similar effects when blocking mTORC1 activity for one hour (Fig. S4A).
Overall, we identified 577 genes that displayed at least a 1.5-fold decrease in the relative
amount of polysomal mRNA as a function of MAPK or mTORC1 inhibition (Dataset S1).
The vast majority of these genes (377) were regulated by both pathways, while 31 and 88
genes were specifically regulated by the MAPK and mTOR pathways, respectively (Fig.
5A). These results strongly support the notion that ERK/RSK signalling controls the
translation of mTORC1-dependent mRNAs, and gene function enrichment analysis revealed
that these mRNAs belong to growth-related biological functions, such as translation
initiation, elongation, cellular response to stress or cell cycle (Fig. 5B).

Author Manuscript

A search for genes having similar response patterns to MAPK and mTORC1 signalling was
performed using K-Means clustering. Among identified clusters, two groups of mRNAs
whose translation are repressed upon inhibitor treatment were identified (Fig. 5C and S4B).
Enrichment analysis identified one predominant biological group in the cluster, namely,
protein synthesis (Fig. 5E). Fifteen different ribosomal proteins, one translation initiation
and two elongation factors were present within these groups (Fig. 5C, 5D and S4C),
suggesting that many ERK/RSK-regulated mRNAs are involved in ribosome biogenesis or

encode components of the translational machinery. A common feature of RNAs encoding
components of the translational machinery is the presence in their 5’ untranslated region
(UTR) of a terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif that is known to be associated with
mTORC1-dependent translation regulation (37). Strikingly, one cluster was found to be
significantly enriched in mRNAs that have been previously shown to contain a 5' TOP motif
(22 out of 50 mRNAs, Fisher exact test p-value=1.555e-12)(38). Many of these mRNAs
have previously been shown to be regulated by mTOR and/or rapamycin treatment, such as
eEF1b and Rpl12 (39). Together, these data highly suggest that ERK/RSK signalling
converges on mTORC1 to regulate the translation of mRNAs involved in melanoma cell
growth.
RSK is required for efficient melanoma cell proliferation and tumour development in mice

Author Manuscript

To determine the biological function of ERK/RSK signalling in melanoma, we next
evaluated the impact of knocking down RSK1/2 on melanoma cell proliferation. Depletion
of RSK1/2 by shRNA-mediated RNAi in serum-growing Colo829 and A375 cells resulted
in a significant decrease in proliferation rates, as shown by measuring global metabolic
activity (Fig. 6A) or using cell counts (Fig. 6B). Because RSK was previously shown to
inhibit apoptotic cell death (21, 40), we determined whether RSK1/2 knockdown increased
Annexin V binding. Our results indicate that the number of apoptotic cells was significantly
increased by RSK knockdown (Fig. 6C), but that these changes could not entirely explain
the large reduction in cell proliferation (Fig. 6A and 6B). Using pharmacological inhibitors,
we also found that inhibition of ERK/RSK signalling reduced melanoma cell proliferation to
levels similar to cells treated with mTOR inhibitors (Fig. 6D), and again, these treatments
did not significantly increased apoptosis of melanoma cells (Fig. 6E).

Author Manuscript

Finally, we investigated the role of RSK in melanoma tumour growth using a
xenotransplantation assay in nude mice. For this, A375 or Colo829 cells were infected with
lentiviruses expressing RSK1/2 shRNAs and populations of transduced cells (2 × 106 cells)
were injected subcutaneously in the flanks of nude mice. As shown in Fig. 6F and 6G, A375
and Colo829 cells expressing a control shRNA rapidly formed tumours in mice, reaching 0.5
cm3 within ~30-50 days of injection. In sharp contrast, depletion of RSK1/2 almost
completely inhibited tumour formation from A375 and Colo829 cells, indicating that RSK is
essential for melanoma tumour growth in vivo. We monitored RSK1/2 expression in
xenografts from A375 cells obtained two months post-injection (Fig. 6F), and found that
these tumours recovered RSK expression to almost wild-type levels. Together, our data
indicate that ERK/RSK signalling contributes to the constitutively high mTORC1 activity in
melanoma cells, and that RSK inhibition abrogates tumour development in mice.

Author Manuscript

Discussion
The data presented here demonstrate that oncogenic MAPK signalling promotes constitutive
mTORC1 activation and downstream signalling to its main targets, S6K1 and 4E-BP1 (Fig.
1-4). Further, our results indicate that the ERK1/2-activated protein kinase RSK plays an
important role in this process, as RSK inhibitors and RNAi strongly reduced mTORC1
activity in melanoma (Fig. 2, 3 and 4). Consistently, we found that ERK/RSK signalling

regulates the translation of growth-related mRNAs also controlled by the mTOR pathway
(Fig. 5), supporting the notion that oncogenic ERK/RSK signalling promotes mTORC1dependent functions. RSK depletion was found to inhibit melanoma cell proliferation and
tumour growth (Fig. 6), indicating that melanoma cells are highly dependent on ERK/RSK
signalling for their growth and proliferation.

Author Manuscript

Translational regulation plays a pivotal role in tumour formation and metastasis (41, 42).
Accordingly, our data indicate that RSK controls melanoma cell growth by modulating the
phosphorylation status of important components of the translational machinery. Particularly,
the inhibitory activity of 4E-BP1 was found to be highly dependent on ERK/RSK signalling,
as inhibition of MEK1/2 and RSK dramatically decreased eIF4F complex formation and
polysome formation. These results suggest that 4E-BP1 plays an important role in mediating
MAPK-dependent melanoma cell growth. This is supported by observations that depletion
of Raptor in melanoma cells is lethal (data not shown), and by studies showing that tumours
in which 4E-BP1 expression is reduced are less addicted to oncogenic MAPK signalling
(43). Our findings are in a good agreement with recent studies demonstrating that 4E-BP1 is
a major integrator of oncogenic signalling pathways (44) and that mTORC1-dependent cell
proliferation is mediated by the 4E-BPs (45).

Author Manuscript

Although we have shown that ERK/RSK signalling regulates cell growth via mTORC1, we
cannot exclude additional modes of translational regulation. Indeed, rapamycin was found to
be less effective than RSK inhibitors in reducing global protein synthesis (Fig. 4 and 6),
suggesting that ERK/RSK signalling regulates additional proteins involved in mRNA
translation. Consistent with this, RSK was previously shown to phosphorylate the translation
initiation factor eIF4B and thereby stimulate its recruitment to the translation initiation
complex (46). The ribosomal protein S6 has also been shown to be directly phosphorylated
by RSK at Ser235/236 (47), but the exact outcome of this phosphorylation event remains
elusive. Therefore, ERK/RSK signalling appears to participate at several levels of
translational control, which may explain the acute dependency of melanoma cells to
ERK/RSK activity. Consistent with these findings, ERK and RSK were recently shown to
regulate LKB1 (48), a tumour suppressor protein that is involved in the activation of the
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). ERK- and RSK-mediated phosphorylation of LKB1
was shown to be important for cell proliferation (48), suggesting that several ERK/RSKdependent mechanisms may contribute to the regulation of melanoma growth.

Author Manuscript

Our data demonstrate a molecular link between oncogenic MAPK signalling and mTORdependent growth in melanoma, and indicate that RSK may be a valuable therapeutic target
for the treatment of metastatic melanomas, as well as other cancer types characterized by the
hyperactivation of the MAPK pathway. RSK inhibitors could also be used in combination
with drugs that target the PI3K pathway, as was done with MEK1/2 inhibitors (49), which
may inhibit mTORC1 more efficiently in tumours that also display activating mutations in
PI3K pathway components.

continuously monitored and recorded using a Gradient Station IP (Biocomp, Fredericton,
NB) attached to a UV-MII (GE Healthcare) spectrophotometer. Polysomal fractions were
collected and RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). For RT-qPCR
experiments, total RNA was extracted using the same procedure.
Quantitative Real-Time PCR and Microarray Experiments

Author Manuscript

Total RNA was reverse transcribed using the cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied
Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Gene expression levels of
endogenous controls GAPDH and ACTB were determined using pre-validated Taqman
Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems), and gene expression level for RSK isoforms
was determined using assays designed with the Universal Probe Library (UPL) from Roche.
Microarray experiments were performed in triplicate using Nimblegen Human Gene
Expression 4x72K Arrays according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche NimbleGen,
Madison, WI). For each condition, 6.5 μg of polysomal or total RNA was reverse
transcribed and labeled using Cy3 (Trilink Biotechnology). The labeled material was then
hybridized to the microarray overnight at 42°C, washed and scanned at 5 μm resolution.
Microarray Data Analysis

Author Manuscript

Data was quantified and Robust Multichip Average (RMA) normalized using NimbleScan
software. Normalized data was log2-transformed and analyzed using Bioconductor packages
and R statistical language. Using the R package limma, we fit linear models to identify
genes regulated between different conditions. A batch effect term was added to the model to
account for experimental bias and an interaction term allowed the identification of
translational regulation independent of cytosolic mRNA level change. Genes having log2coefficients smaller than −0.58 (1.5 fold decrease) and p-value smaller than 0.05 were
considered as significantly regulated. The replicate average log2- signals of genes
downregulated in polysomal mRNA in the presence of mTOR and MAPK inhibitors were
used as input for K-Means clustering using MeV Software. Enrichment analysis was
performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) and through the use of Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity® Systems).
Proliferation and Apoptosis Assay

Author Manuscript

For proliferation assays, 2×103 cells were seeded in 96-well plates. Cells were grown in the
presence of inhibitors when indicated. The relative number of viable cells was measured
every 24 h during four consecutive days using a nonradioactive cell proliferation assay from
Promega (Madison, WI). For cell counting, 5×104 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and
grown as described above. After 48h, cells were stained with trypan blue and counted using
a hemacytometer. Results displayed represent the mean of triplicates ± standard error (SE).
For analysis of apoptotic cells, 3 × 105 A375 cells were seeded in 35-mm dishes and grown
in 10% FBS for 48 h. After trypsination, cells were washed twice with ice cold PBS
containing 5 mM CaCl2 and incubated with PE labeled annexin V (BD Pharmingen). Cells
were washed twice and processed on a BD FACS Canto II cytometer.

Mouse Xenotransplantation Studies

Author Manuscript

All animals were housed under pathogen-free conditions, and experiments were performed
in accordance with CCAC guidelines. Female Balb/c athymic nude mice (nu/nu) were
purchased from Harlan and used at 6–8 weeks of age. For subcutaneous tumor model
studies, A375 or Colo829 cells stably expressing shRSK1 and shRSK2 were harvested from
sub-confluent cultures by brief exposure to 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% EDTA. The cells were
washed once in PBS, and 2 × 106 cells in a final volume of 200 μl were injected
subcutaneously in the flanks of the mouse. The mice were monitored regularly and the
tumors were measured every 2–3 days using a caliper.

Oncogenic RAS and RAF promote mTORC1 signalling in a RSK-dependent manner. (A)
HEK293 cells stably expressing constitutively-activated MEK1 (MEK-DD), Ras (G12V) or
Raf (V600E) were serum-starved overnight, and analyzed for ERK and RSK
phosphorylation by immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitated RSK1 kinase activity was assayed
using GST-rpS6 as substrate, in the presence of γ[32P]ATP. Samples were subjected to SDSPAGE and the dried coomassie-stained gel autoradiographed. (B) HEK293 cells stably
expressing constitutively-activated MEK1, Ras or Raf were serum-starved overnight, pretreated with U0126 (U0), PD184352 (PD), SL0101 (SL), BI-D1870 (BI) or rapamycin
(RAP) for 1h, prior to being harvested. Immunoprecipitated S6K1 kinase activity was
assayed using GST-rpS6 as substrate, in the presence of γ[32P]ATP. The histogram shows
quantifications of phosphorylated rpS6 from three independent experiments.
Phosphorylation of endogenous rpS6 and S6K1, and total rpS6 protein level were monitored
by immunoblotting. (C) Control and constitutively-activated cells were maintained in lowserum (2%) for 18 hr. Global protein synthesis was measured by adding 0.5 μCi/ml
[3H]leucine to the medium for 6 hours. Histograms show radioactivity incorporation
normalized to time 0. (D) As in (C), except that cells were treated with indicated inhibitors
for 60 minutes prior to addition of 0.5 μCi/ml [3H]leucine to the medium.

Inhibition of ERK/RSK signalling decreases constitutive activation of mTORC1 in
melanoma. (A) Four melanoma cell lines were used in this study. While A375 and Colo829
cells harbour a B-Raf V600E mutation, WM852 and WM1361 cells carry an N-Ras
mutation at Q61 (R or K). (B) Phosphorylation of endogenous RSK, ERK1/2, rpS6, S6K1
and 4E-BP1 was monitored in total extracts from serum-starved melanoma cell lines and
normal human melanocytes treated or not with insulin (100 nM) for 30 min. Cell lysates
were also immunoblotted for total protein levels (RSK1, ERK1, rpS6, S6K1, 4E-BP1 and βactin). (C) Serum-starved melanoma cells were treated with the indicated inhibitors for 60
minutes. Immunoprecipitated S6K1 kinase activity was assayed as in Fig. 1. (D)
Phosphorylation of endogenous rpS6 and S6K1, and total rpS6 protein level were monitored
