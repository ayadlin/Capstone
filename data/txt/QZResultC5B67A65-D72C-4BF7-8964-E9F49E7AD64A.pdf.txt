BACKGROUND: The objective of this case-control study was to identify any association of metformin intake with the survival of
patients with ovarian cancer. METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, women with ovarian cancer who received metformin
(cases) were compared with women with ovarian cancer who did not receive metformin (controls). A 2-layered analysis was conducted. In preliminary analysis, all cases (the OC cohort) were compared with controls at a 1:2 ratio. Subsequently, in definitive analysis, only patients who had epithelial ovarian cancer (the EOC cohort) were compared with controls at a 1:3 ratio. In the EOC cohort,
cases were matched with controls for age (5 years), International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage, and residual disease. Prognostic variables and disease specific survival were compared using chi-square tests, the Kaplan-Meier (log-rank) method,
and Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: In a preliminary analysis of the OC cohort (72 cases and 143 controls), cases had
better survival (5-year disease-specific survival for cases vs controls, 73% vs 44%; P ¼ .0002). In the definitive analysis of the EOC
cohort (61 cases and 178 controls), the distribution of age, disease stage, optimal cytoreduction, serous histology, and platinum chemotherapy remained similar between cases and controls (P > .05). Despite these similarities, cases had significantly better survival (5year disease-specific survival for cases vs controls, 67% vs 47%; P ¼ .007). On multivariate analysis, metformin remained an independent predictor of survival (hazard ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.8; P ¼ .007) after controlling for disease stage, grade, histology, chemotherapy, body mass index, and surgical cytoreduction. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated an association
of metformin intake with survival in patients with ovarian cancer. The receipt of metformin was associated with better survival, and

INTRODUCTION
The case fatality ratio of ovarian cancer is extremely high.1 This is because 75% of patients have extensive stage disease
(stage >III) at diagnosis, and the currently available therapies in up-front and recurrent ovarian cancer have limited efficacy.2 Consequently, there is a great need to develop improved up-front and salvage therapies for ovarian cancer.2
Novel therapies for ovarian cancer can originate by designing and discovering new drugs de novo. Although promising, this approach carries the limitation of being tremendously expensive and very time consuming. In fact, it is estimated
that de novo drug discovery may take as long as 10 to 17 years and $800 million (US) per agent.3 Therefore, alternative
means of finding novel therapies need to be explored. One such avenue is drug repositioning, which is an approach in which
already existing drugs are used to treat a different and new disease. This approach carries the promise of accelerating the
translation of laboratory research to the clinical practice in a shorter time frame.4 Numerous examples of successful drug
repositioning exist, one of which is the US food and Drug Administration approval of a morning sickness drug, lenalidomide, for multiple myeloma.5
Originating from the French Lilac plant (Galega officinalis), metformin is one of the most commonly used medications for diabetes worldwide. We previously demonstrated that metformin has anticancer effects in ovarian cancer both in
vitro6 and in vivo.7 Similar observations from others have suggested the anticancer effects of metformin in neoplasms of
the prostate,8 colon,9 pancreas,10 and brain.11 In breast cancer, a large, phase 3, randomized clinical trial is already underway to test metformin in >200 oncology centers (National Clinical Trial identifier NCT01101438). However, to date,
only a small study has assessed the association of metformin with the prognosis of actual patients with ovarian cancer.12

The objective of the current study was to investigate
whether there is an association between metformin and
prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This study was approved by the Institutional Review
Board of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minn). Consecutive patients with a diagnosis of ovarian cancer who
received metformin were identified by inpatient hospital
records (metformin given) as well as outpatient pharmacy
prescription records (prescription filled) of the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester between 1995 and 2010. Diagnosis
codes according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, third revision, were used for patient
identification. The mean duration of metformin intake
was 2.3 years (range, 1-11 years), and the minimum
length of metformin use included in the study was 1 year.
The receipt of metformin, as captured by our hospital
records, was at or after the cancer diagnosis. Metformin
was prescribed at doses from 500 mg twice daily to 1 g
twice daily. The duration of metformin use before cancer
diagnosis was unknown because patient records before the
cancer diagnosis were not available. The reason patients
received metformin was the presence of diabetes in the
cases.
In this report, patients with ovarian cancer who
received metformin are referred to as cases, and patients
with ovarian cancer without diabetes who did not receive
metformin are referred to as controls (nondiabetic controls). Patients with ovarian cancer with diabetes who
received insulin or other antidiabetic medications (but
not metformin) are referred to as diabetic controls.
Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the weight
in kilograms/height in meters squared (kg/m2). Stage of
disease was assigned in accordance with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) surgical
staging criteria. For the purposes of comparison, early or
low-stage disease was classified as FIGO stage I and II,
and late or advanced-stage disease was classified as FIGO
stage III and IV. For statistical brevity without losing biologic significance; the histologic grade was categorized as
high grade or low grade. Surgical cytoreduction was classified as optimal if the greatest dimension of residual disease
was 1 cm or suboptimal if it was >1 cm. Patients who
had no evidence of gross residual disease were classified as
completely cytoreduced. Comparison of histology was
completed using each distinct histologic group as well as
nonserous versus serous histologies. The type of chemotherapy, the number of cycles, and the number of agents
received were recorded for each patient. In addition, plati556

num chemotherapy was compared with nonplatinum
chemotherapy. Disease-specific survival (DSS) also was
recorded. None of the patients had breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutations, and none received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients who had a platinum-free
interval of 12 months were deemed to have platinumsensitive disease.
The Ovarian Cancer Cohort

In total, 72 women were identified who had ovarian cancer and had received metformin. A 2-layered analysis was
conducted. In the initial, preliminary analysis, all 72 cases
were compared with 143 randomly selected controls.
Because this analysis involved all ovarian cancer patients
irrespective of histology, we labeled this the all OC cohort.
In OC cohort cases, all but 1 patient had 2 matched controls. Consequently, the OC cohort consisted of 215
patients in total. The purpose of this preliminary analysis
was to describe the full spectrum of ovarian cancer
observed in association with metformin intake de novo
and to compare them with controls.
The Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Cohort

In the subsequent, definitive analysis, epithelial ovarian
cancer cases (n ¼ 61) were identified from the parent
cohort of 72 cases after excluding patients who had nonepithelial ovarian cancer (n ¼ 5), tumors with low malignant potential (n ¼ 2), and atypical, rare histology types
(transitional and small cell cancers of the ovary; n ¼ 4).
These 61 cases were matched with controls at a 1:3 ratio
based on 3 variables: age at diagnosis (5 years), FIGO
stage, and surgical cytoreduction status (optimal vs suboptimal). Of those matched cases, 57 had 3 controls each, 3
had 2 controls each, and 1 had only 1 control. Therefore,
the definitive analysis cohort of cases matched with controls consisted of 239 patients (61 cases and 178 controls).
Because the definitive cohort had patients with epithelial
ovarian cancer only, we labeled this the EOC cohort. The
purpose of the definitive analysis was to identify the association of metformin with survival in epithelial ovarian
cancer, because the later accounts for the vast majority of
the mortality ascribed to the disease in the adult population, and the distribution of histology and FIGO stage
was disparate in our initial analysis of the OC cohort
(Table 1) between cases and controls.
The Diabetic Control Group

Data were collected on the 103 patients who had both diabetes and epithelial ovarian cancer and had received insulin or other antidiabetic medications rather than
metformin. This cohort was referred to as the diabetic control group. Because of the small sample size (n ¼ 103),

well as clinically important variables that had well known
association with prognosis (disease stage, histology, grade,
chemotherapy, etc) in patients with ovarian cancer were
included. This model was constructed to assess whether
metformin exhibits an independent association with survival in ovarian cancer. All tests were 2-sided, and P values
 .05 were considered statistically significant. Statistical
analyses were done using the SAS statistical software package (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Initial analyses (the OC cohort) were based on 72 cases
and 143 randomly selected controls. One case had only 1
control (thus, in total, there were 143 controls rather than
144). Table 1 lists the key variables for the cases and controls. The distribution of age, year of diagnosis, optimal
surgical cytoreduction, and platinum-based chemotherapy was similar in cases and controls (Table 1). The BMI
of cases was higher than that of controls, as expected. Early
stage, lower grade, and nonserous histology tumors were
significantly more prevalent in cases than in controls, as
indicated in Table 1. The entire cohort had a median DSS
of 5.5 years (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1-7.5 years).
The median survival for controls was 4.1 years, and the
median survival for cases was not reached (log-rank P ¼
.002). The 5-year survival rate for controls was 44% versus 73% for cases (log-rank P ¼ .002) (Fig. 1). Results
from the multivariable analysis for the OC cohort are presented in Table 2. In this analysis, after adjusting for age,
year of diagnosis, BMI, disease stage, histology, and
chemotherapy, only grade (hazard ratio, 8.6; 95% CI,
1.2-63; P ¼ .03) and receipt of metformin (hazard ratio,

The Epithelial Ovarian Cancer Cohort

In the definitive analysis of the EOC cohort, 61 cases of
epithelial ovarian cancer were matched with 178 controls.
The distribution of the key variables among cases and
controls in the definitive analysis of the EOC cohort is
depicted in Table 3. The mean duration of follow-up for
cases was 3.7 years (median 3.4 years) vs 4.3 years (median
3.3 years) for controls. The distribution of matching variables (age, FIGO stage, and surgical cytoreductive effort
measured by postoperative residual disease) remained
similar among cases and controls (Table 3). Furthermore,
the distribution of grade, histology (serous vs nonserous),
and chemotherapy remained similar between cases and
controls (P > .05) (Table 3). Recurrence after chemotherapy was reported in 194 patients (47 cases and 147 controls). Platinum-sensitive disease was present in 29 of 47
cases (62%) versus 82 of 147 controls (56%; P ¼ .5). The

median recurrence-free survival was 32 months for cases
and 22 months for controls (P ¼ .04).
The 5-year DSS rate for the entire cohort was 52%.
The 5-year DSS rate in cases (67%) was significantly better compared with the DSS rate in controls (47%; logrank P ¼ .006) (Fig. 2). Results from the multivariable
analysis are presented in Table 4. After adjusting for BMI,
grade, histology, and chemotherapy, metformin remained
an independent predictor of survival in ovarian cancer.
The definitive study cohort of 239 patients with
epithelial ovarian cancer was divided further into 2 subgroups based on the absence (residual disease measuring
0 cm) or presence (residual disease measuring >0 cm) of
gross residual disease to assess the association of metformin with prognosis in these 2 subgroups. Of 239
patients in the EOC cohort, 130 (55%) underwent complete cytoreduction (residual disease measuring 0 cm),
and 106 (45%) underwent incomplete cytoreduction
(residual disease measuring >0 cm); whereas, in 3
patients, the status of residual disease remained
unknown. In patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who
underwent complete cytoreduction, the 5-year survival
of cases was 90% versus 69% in controls (P ¼ .04) (Fig.
3, top left). Conversely, for patients with epithelial ovarian cancer who underwent incomplete cytoreduction,
the 5-year survival rate was 41% for cases was versus
21% for controls (P ¼ .047) (Fig. 3, top right). Finally,

survival among controls.
Comparison of the Epithelial Ovarian Cancer
Cohort With the Diabetic Control Group

A comparison of data between the diabetic control group
and the EOC cohort is presented in the Table 3. Compared
with cases in the EOC cohort, controls in the diabetic control group were slightly older and had marginally lower
BMI. However, the distribution of disease stage, histology,
grade, extent of surgical cytoreduction, and platinum-based
chemotherapy remained similar between cases in the EOC
cohort and diabetic controls. Despite these similarities, the
5-year DSS rate for diabetic controls was the lowest (40%)
compared with cases in the EOC cohort (67%) and nondiabetic controls (47%; P ¼ .003) (Fig. 4). Survival also
was assessed based on metformin intake versus insulin or
other antidiabetic medication intake in patients with ovarian cancer. Receipt of metformin was associated with the
best 5-year DSS rate (67%) compared with insulin (43%)
and other antidiabetic medications (34%; P ¼ .004), as
illustrated in Figure 5.
DISCUSSION
The current study is the largest case-control study to our
knowledge that evaluates the association between metformin and survival in women with ovarian cancer. Although
causation could not be assessed; we observed that receipt
of metformin was associated with significantly better survival in ovarian cancer. The interest in metformin as an
anticancer compound initially was ignited by 2 key epidemiologic reports. Evans et al reported a reduced risk of
cancer in diabetic patients who were receiving metformin,13 whereas Bowker et al demonstrated reduced

control group. There are 2 reasons for this approach: 1) It
has been demonstrated that diabetes has a negative impact
on ovarian cancer survival15 and, thus, a comparison of
survival between the cases and diabetic control groups was
likely to overestimate the magnitude of survival benefit

associated with metformin; and 2) the vast majority of
patients with ovarian cancer are not diabetic and will be
candidates for enrolment into future clinical trials using
metformin in ovarian cancer. Therefore, in terms of clinical applicability, the study results using nondiabetic controls are more relevant. However, we could argue that, in
an ideal study, the cases and controls should differ only in
terms of exposure (metformin) and not in terms of other
confounders (eg, diabetes). To overcome this limitation,
we have also provided clinical and survival data for the diabetic control group (Table 3, Fig. 4).
Before metformin can be received by patients for its
anticancer effect, prospective trials using metformin in
ovarian cancer are warranted. Our data provide support
for such trials. To that end, the most important question
is to decipher whether our current observations are merely
by chance or are the results of a true clinical effect. It is
noteworthy that, in our initial analysis of the OC cohort
that incorporated all metformin-associated ovarian cancers, metformin-associated tumors were more likely to be
lower grade, earlier stage, and had a more favorable histology profile. One could attribute the association of better
prognosis in the OC cohort cases with that of metformin
on the constellation of these lower risk attributes. Part of
our data in the OC cohort lends some support to this hypothesis. For example, 4 cases (5.6%) in the OC cohort
had granulosa cell tumors (Table 1), and patients who
have granulosa cell tumors have a much better prognosis
compared with patients who have epithelial ovarian cancer. In addition, diabetes and obesity are commonly the
result of hormone effects of the tumor itself,16 leading to
the prescription of metformin. Along similar lines, tumors
with low malignant potential were observed more frequently in cases than in controls (Table 1) and have a better prognosis compared with frankly invasive epithelial
ovarian cancers. Despite these limitations, the primary
value of the preliminary analysis of the OC cohort was to
describe the full spectrum of ovarian tumors associated
with metformin intake. Furthermore, the emergence of
metformin as an independent predictor of survival in the
OC cohort multivariable analysis (Table 2), in which disease stage, grade, and histology were controlled, tends to
favor a true association between metformin and a clinically beneficial impact in ovarian cancer.
Next, we conducted our definitive analysis of the
EOC cohort to overcome the above-mentioned limitations posed by the nonuniform distribution of FIGO
stage and tumor types in the OC cohort. The EOC cohort
only included women with epithelial ovarian cancers, and
the controls were matched for age, FIGO stage, and residCancer

ual disease after cytoreductive surgery (Table 3). All 3 of
these matching criteria are the primary determinants
affecting survival in ovarian cancer.17,18 The distribution
of all variables analyzed was statistically similar between
cases and controls in the EOC cohort with the exception
of BMI (Table 3). Cases had higher BMI, because metformin is usually prescribed to obese diabetic individuals.19
It is unlikely that this unequal distribution of BMI
affected our survival analysis, because: 1) BMI is not considered to have prognostic value in ovarian cancer,20 and
2) BMI was controlled in the multivariable analysis. In
our analysis of the EOC cohort, the association of metformin with better survival persisted in the overall analysis as
well as in the subgroup analysis of the complete and
incomplete cytoreduction subgroups. Second, when the
analysis was restricted to serous histology only or
advanced-stage tumors only, the survival advantage associated with metformin persisted. Finally, the multivariable
analysis, after controlling for BMI, histology, tumor
grade, and type of chemotherapy, indicated that metformin is an independent predictor of survival in patients
with ovarian cancer. These observations suggest that confounding is unlikely to be the sole factor accounting for
the remarkable difference in prognosis between cases and
controls. Moreover, previous data from our laboratory
indicated a potent inhibition of cell division, cell survival,
and antitumor activity of metformin in a mouse model of
ovarian cancer.6,7 Taken together, these data suggest a
possible causative role of metformin in exhibiting antitumor activity in ovarian cancer.
The limitations of this study are its retrospective nature, small sample size, and lack of information on the
receipt of metformin before cancer diagnosis because of a
lack of medical records before patient care was established.
However, to our knowledge, this is the largest clinical
study to date evaluating the association between metformin and prognosis in ovarian cancer. One previous study
evaluated the association between metformin and survival
in patients with ovarian cancer12 and demonstrated better
recurrence-free survival, similar to our report. However,
the current report overcomes several limitations that were
posed by the previous study. These include a much larger
sample size of 72 cases (vs 16 cases in the previous study),
the ability to match cases in the EOC cohort with nondiabetic controls for important clinical variables (vs nonmatched controls in the previous study), and the ability to
demonstrate differences in overall survival (vs only recurrence-free survival advantage in cases in the previous study
in multivariable analysis). Moreover, although a sample
size of 72 cases may be perceived as relatively small, the

receipt of metformin because of diabetes in cancer patients
is rather uncommon. This notion is supported by a study of
metformin in patients with breast cancer from The University of Texas M. D Anderson Cancer Center by Jiralerspong
et al, in which only 68 such patients could be identified.21
Conversely, our ability to match cases and controls for 3
variables (age, FIGO stage, and surgical cytoreduction) is a
noteworthy strength of the current study. The later is especially true, because surgical effort is largely surgeon-dependent (rather than depending on tumor biology), and diabetic
patients have higher operative morbidity,22 which may
limit the fraction of patients who have comprehensive surgical staging at a given institution.15 Thus, this factor was
eliminated by matching for surgical effort.
In conclusion, the results from our current case-control study demonstrate that metformin intake independently predicts better survival in patients with ovarian
cancer. Although causation could not be assessed by our
retrospective study, metformin nevertheless is a strong
contender for further clinical studies in ovarian cancer.
These may be retrospective, confirmatory studies by other
institutions and/or prospective phase 2/3 studies in
women with ovarian cancer.
