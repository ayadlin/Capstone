BACKGROUND: Bortezomib, an inhibitor of the 26S proteasome and NF-jB, may have antitumor activity in adenoid
cystic carcinoma (ACC). Preclinical studies have shown synergy between bortezomib and doxorubicin. METHODS:
Eligibility criteria included incurable ACC, any number of prior therapies but without an anthracycline, unidimensionally measurable disease, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and ejection fraction within
normal limits. Patients with stable disease for 9 months were excluded. Patients received bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 by
intravenous (IV) push on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11, every 21 days until progression. Doxorubicin 20 mg/m2 IV on Days 1 and
8 was added at the time of progression. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled, of whom 24 were eligible; the
most common distant metastatic sites were the lung (n ¼ 22) and the liver (n ¼ 7). There was no objective response
with single-agent bortezomib; best response was stable disease in 15 (71%) of 21 evaluable patients. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.4 months and 21 months, respectively. Of 10 evaluable patients who
received bortezomib plus doxorubicin, 1 had a partial response, and 6 had stable disease. The most frequent toxicity
with bortezomib was grade 3 sensory neuropathy (16%). With bortezomib plus doxorubicin, serious toxicities seen
more than once were grade 3-4 neutropenia (n ¼ 3) and grade 3 anorexia (n ¼ 2). CONCLUSIONS: Bortezomib was
well tolerated and resulted in disease stabilization in a high percentage of patients but no objective responses. The
combination of bortezomib and doxorubicin was also well tolerated and may warrant further investigation in ACC.

KEYWORDS: head and neck cancer, adenoid cystic carcinoma, bortezomib, doxorubicin.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) comprises approximately 20% of all malignant salivary gland tumors and is the
most common cancer type that arises from the minor salivary glands. ACC of the head and neck has a propensity for perineural invasion and demonstrates high local recurrence rates. However, these tumors may exhibit a protracted natural history, with indolent growth of metastatic lung disease.1,2 Common sites of metastatic disease are the lung, liver, and bone.
Traditional chemotherapeutics have mild to modest activity in salivary gland tumors.3 A few prospective studies have
focused on patients with ACC. A phase 2 study of epirubicin showed a 10% response rate, whereas 29% of patients noted
symptomatic improvement.4 Mitoxantrone as well as fluorouracil have also been reported to have modest single-agent

activity.5,6 Combinations that include doxorubicin, such
as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and cisplatin,7,8 as
well as vinorelbine9,10 have shown activity in salivary
gland tumors, including ACC. The Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) conducted a phase 2 trial of
paclitaxel (E1394) in patients with chemotherapy naive,
advanced or metastatic salivary gland malignancies.
Although paclitaxel demonstrated modest activity in
mucoepidermoid carcinoma (3 of 13 responded) and adenocarcinoma histologies (5 of 17), no responses were
observed in 14 patients with ACC.11 Despite lack of
response, the 5-year survival for patients with ACC was
32%, and the median survival was 25 months.11 The evaluation of novel systemic agents in patients with ACC is
highly warranted.
Bortezomib (PS-341) is a highly selective inhibitor
of the 26S proteasome, which is central for the ubiquitinproteasome that is involved in the degradation of multiple
key regulatory proteins of the cell cycle. Bortezomib has
demonstrated preclinical activity in a variety of malignant
tumors and is synergistic with doxorubicin,12-14 1 of the
few drugs with modest activity in ACC. The combination
of bortezomib and doxorubicin is well tolerated and has
shown promise for the treatment of multiple myeloma.15,16 NF-jB, a key target of bortezomib, is
expressed in ACC, and relates to angiogenesis and poor
patient outcome.17,18 Inhibition of NF-jB activity can
suppress the growth of salivary gland tumors.19 Moreover,
the combination of chemotherapy and inhibition of NFjB enhances the antitumor activity of chemotherapy in
transformed salivary gland cells.20 Therefore, NF-jB
inhibitors, such as bortezomib, may be a promising therapy for salivary gland tumors. We conducted a multicenter phase 2 trial of bortezomib followed by doxorubicin
plus bortezomib at the time of progression in patients
with incurable ACC to evaluate the efficacy and toxicities
of this regimen.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patient Selection
Eligible patients were age 18 years or older, with locally
advanced, recurrent, or metastatic ACC of the head and
neck that was considered incurable by known therapies.
Any number of prior therapies but no prior anthracyclines
(doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin, idarubicin),
mitoxantrone, or bortezomib were allowed. Other key eligibility criteria included unidimensionally measurable
disease measured within 3 weeks before registration

according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
Tumors (RECIST),21 ECOG performance status 0-2, left
ventricular ejection fraction at or above the institutional
lower limits of normal, serum creatinine within normal
institutional limits, or creatinine clearance 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase 2.5 the institutional upper limit of
normal, absolute neutrophil count 1500/lL, platelets
100,000/lL, and total bilirubin within normal limits.
Patients with stable disease at study entry for 9 months
were excluded. Pregnant women as well as patients with
pre-existing neuropathy of grade >1, known brain metastases, human immunodeficiency virus positivity, history
of congestive heart failure, or uncontrolled intercurrent
illness were excluded. The study was coordinated by the
ECOG (protocol E1303) and was registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT00077428). The study protocol was
approved by the institutional review board of each ECOG
institution, and all patients signed written informed consent. Archival baseline tumor tissue was retrieved for biomarker studies.
Treatment Plan
Bortezomib was administered at a dose of 1.3 mg/m2 as
an intravenous (IV) push over 3 to 5 seconds, twice weekly
for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week off treatment (ie, Days 1,
4, 8, and 11, every 21 days) until disease progression, at
which time doxorubicin was added at a dose of 20 mg/m2,
given as an IV push over 2 to 5 minutes with extravasation
precautions on Days 1 and 8, every 21 days (starting
within 10-28 days from the last bortezomib administration), assuming patients had an ECOG performance status 0-2 and adequate organ and marrow function, and no
evidence of congestive heart failure. Bortezomib was given
first followed 1 hour later by doxorubicin; a minimum of
72 hours should have elapsed between bortezomib doses.
Cardioprotection with dexrazoxane 200 mg/m2 IV (ie,
dexrazoxane/doxorubicin ratio of 10:1) was administered
before doxorubicin and after bortezomib on Days 1 and 8
starting with the eighth cycle (ie, cumulative doxorubicin
dose of 280 mg/m2) and all subsequent cycles. Treatment
with bortezomib and doxorubicin continued until progression or to a maximum of 14 cycles (ie, cumulative
doxorubicin dose of 560 mg/m2).
Study Assessments and Monitoring
Baseline evaluations included complete blood counts
(CBCs), chemistry studies, including liver function tests,

3375

Original Article

and MUGA (multigated acquisition) scan or echocardiogram to assess left ventricular ejection fraction. Scans and
x-rays were used to assess all measurable or nonmeasurable
sites of disease within 3 weeks of registration. Patients
were reevaluated for tumor response after every 2 cycles
or 6 weeks. Objective response was evaluated using
RECIST.21 When a patient was deemed to have an objective response, tumor measurements were to be repeated 6
weeks later to confirm the response. Toxicities were
assessed using the National Cancer Institute’s Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0.
CBCs, chemistry studies, and liver function tests were performed in the beginning of each cycle and CBCs on the
day of each bortezomib or doxorubicin administration.

Statistical Design and Methods
The primary endpoint of the study was objective tumor
response rate (including complete and partial overall
responses) among patients receiving single-agent bortezomib. A 2-stage design was used. A true response rate of
20% was considered worthy of further study, whereas a
true response rate of 5% was considered not worthy of further study. To allow for 10% ineligibility rate, a total of
23 patients were to be accrued in the first stage to obtain
21 eligible patients. If at least 2 responses were observed in
the first stage, another 14 patients would have been
accrued in the second stage to obtain 13 eligible patients.
Otherwise, accrual would be terminated. If at least 4
responses were observed, the treatment would be considered promising and worthy of further study. On the basis
of the accrual of previous ECOG studies in salivary gland
tumors (eg, E1394), the study was expected to take
approximately 2.3 years to accrue a total of 37 patients.
The analysis of efficacy outcomes excluded ineligible
patients; toxicity analysis excluded patients who never
received treatment. Overall survival (OS) was defined as
the time from registration to death from any cause or censored at the time of last contact. Time to progression
(TTP) was defined as the time from registration to progression. Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as
the time from registration to documented progression or
death without progression. Patients without documented
progression or death were censored at the time of the last
disease assessment. The survival data were analyzed using
the Kaplan-Meier method.22 No comparison of study
outcomes by patient characteristics, such as race and sex,
was made, because the study not powered to detect such
differences.

RESULTS
From June 2004 to June 2005, a total of 25 patients
entered the study. Of these 25 patients, 1 patient was
ineligible because not all areas of disease were assessed
within 3 weeks of registration. Thus, 24 patients were
classified as eligible for the study. Thirteen of these
patients were registered to the second step of the study after progressing on single-agent bortezomib, 1 of whom
was ineligible because of lack of documentation of progressive disease on bortezomib. Among the eligible
patients, there were 20 deaths. Two patients died without
documented progression by objective criteria.
Patient Characteristics and Treatment
Table 1 provides demographics and disease characteristics
at the time of enrollment for eligible patients (n ¼ 24).
The majority of patients were women, and their performance status was 0-1. Most patients (n ¼ 22) had lung metastases. Ten patients had prior chemotherapy, of whom 7
patients had >1 chemotherapy regimen, 21 patients had
prior surgery, and 23 patients had prior radiation therapy.
The median number of bortezomib cycles was 5 (range, 137) and of bortezomib and doxorubicin was 7.5 (range, 114). Disease progression was the most frequent reason for
withdrawal from study treatment (Table 2). One patient
completed the maximum 14 cycles of combined bortezomib and doxorubicin.
Objective Response
Twenty-one patients were evaluable for response (Table
3). No complete or partial responses were observed with
single-agent bortezomib, but 15 patients had stable disease (71%), and 6 patients had disease progression as their
best response (Table 3). The median duration of stable
disease was 4.2 months (range, 0-20.1). There was no difference in the percentage of patients with stable disease
according to prior chemotherapy status; stable disease was
observed in 9 (75%) of 12 chemotherapy-naive patients
and 6 (67%) of 9 chemotherapy-exposed patients. Ten
patients who received bortezomib and doxorubicin were
evaluable for response. One (10%) patient, who had
received no prior chemotherapy, achieved a partial
response, 6 (60%) patients had stable disease, and 3
(30%) patients experienced disease progression as best
response. The median duration of stable disease was 5.22
months (range, 0-10.09). Partial response or stable disease
was observed in 5 (71%) of 7 patients without prior chemotherapy and 2 (67%) of 3 patients with a history of prior
chemotherapy.

PFS and OS
Among the 24 patients treated on study, 4 (17%) were

median and 1-year PFS were 6.37 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-8.74) and 18% (95% CI, 2%33%), respectively, and the median and 1-year OS were
21 months (95% CI, 15.8-38.0) and 88% (95% CI,
74%-100%), respectively (Fig. 1). Of the 12 eligible
patients who received bortezomib and doxorubicin, 10
(83%) had documented progression. The median TTP of
these patients was 5.63 months (95% CI, 1.05-8.51); the

Toxicity
Tables 4 and 5 show grade 1 or higher toxicities related
(possibly, probably, or definitely) to treatment for all
patients (eligible and ineligible) who received treatment in
step 1 (bortezomib) and step 2 (bortezomib plus doxorubicin). Single-agent bortezomib was associated with rare
grade 3 or 4 toxicities, all of which had a frequency of
<10%, except sensory neuropathy, which was noted in
16% of patients (Table 4). Among 12 patients treated
with bortezomib plus doxorubicin, 1 patient had missing
toxicity data; only 2 serious toxicities, neutropenia and anorexia, developed in >1 patient (Table 5). There was no
treatment-related death. One patient died on study, but
the cause of death was reportedly likely to be disease progression. The family reported that the patient died at
home in his sleep; no autopsy was performed.

Three patients were considered nonevaluable for the following reasons: 1) the only follow-up scan was done >10 weeks
after registration and showed progression, 2) baseline evaluation of target lesions not done within 3 weeks prior to registration, and 3) the patient developed a new pleural effusion after 2 cycles but no fluid cytology was obtained at that time.
Not all target lesions were assessed.

therapy are usually reserved for symptomatic or rapidly
progressive disease. As several molecular abnormalities
have been described in ACC, the study of novel targeted
agents has attracted significant interest. Bortezomib is an
agent approved for hematologic malignancies that inhibits
NF-jB, which may be critical to the growth of salivary
gland tumors. We conducted a phase 2 trial of bortezomib
in patients with incurable ACC that accrued rapidly in the
cooperative group setting, which confirmed the major
unmet need for new therapies in salivary gland cancers.
The toxicity profile of bortezomib was expected, with sensory neuropathy being the most frequent serious toxicity.
Although we did not observe an objective response with
single-agent bortezomib, the median PFS and OS were
6.37 months (95% CI, 1.61-8.74) and 21 months (95%
CI, 15.8-38.0), respectively. Moreover, the addition of
doxorubicin to bortezomib at the time of progression
resulted in 1 partial response among 10 evaluable patients,
and the median TTP was longer with combination therapy versus monotherapy in the patients who received
combination therapy. It is unclear whether this reflects the
activity of doxorubicin or the effect of combined therapy.
It is desirable to study ACC separately from other
salivary gland cancer histologies, given their differential
responses to chemotherapy.11 Only a few prospective clinical trials have been conducted exclusively in patients with
ACC of the head and neck. Despite high levels of expression of c-kit (90% or more) and epidermal growth factor
receptor/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, there
have been no objective responses with imatinib23,24 or

patients had stable disease as best response,24 whereas in
the lapatinib study by Agulnik et al, among 19 assessable
patients, 15 (79%) patients had stable disease, and 9
patients (47%) had stable disease of 6 months.25 Other
studies evaluated trastuzumab,26 gefitinib,27 and cetuxi-

ACC, but did not report objective responses. A phase 2
trial with cetuximab enrolled 30 patients, 23 with ACC.28
Although there were no objective responses, 50% of
patients achieved stable disease that lasted 6 months,
and the median TTP was 6 months. In general, it has

been difficult to compare results across studies, because
the natural history of ACC is variable and sometimes very
protracted. Stable disease, even prolonged, may not be the
effect of treatment but rather represent indolent disease.
In this study, we elected to exclude patients with very
slowly growing tumors that were stable for the previous
9 months by RECIST. Ultimately, randomized, placebo-controlled studies will be important to assess the
impact of treatment on the natural history of disease. In
the ECOG experience, neither paclitaxel in a previous
study11 nor bortezomib in the present trial resulted in
objective responses. The median survival we reported in
this trial is comparable to the median survival seen in the
previous ECOG trial with paclitaxel (21 vs 25 months). A
median PFS of 6 months or stable disease of 6 months
in 50% of patients may be an appropriate null hypothesis
for future trials in advanced ACC. Nevertheless, the addition of doxorubicin to bortezomib at the time of disease
progression resulted in 1 objective response and promising TTP, and is a potentially active combination. Upfront
treatment with bortezomib and doxorubicin may be
worth investigating and is the subject of a phase 2 clinical
trial conducted at the University of Pittsburgh.29 Finally,
although it was originally planned to evaluate the expression of biomarkers that may be affected by the ubiquitinproteasome degradation pathway (eg, NF-jB) on tumor
tissue, only 8 tumor samples could be retrieved, and this
analysis was not performed. Molecular characterization of
ACC should be attempted in future studies.
