Abstract
Induction of new bone formation is frequently seen in the bone lesions from prostate cancer. However,
whether osteogenesis is necessary for prostate tumor growth in bone is unknown. Recently, 2 xenografts, MDAPCa-118b and MDA-PCa-133, were generated from prostate cancer bone metastases. When implanted subcutaneously in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, MDA-PCa-118b induced strong ectopic bone
formation while MDA-PCa-133 did not. To identify the factors that are involved in bone formation, we compared
the expression of secreted factors (secretome) from MDA-PCa-118b and MDA-PCa-133 by cytokine array. We
found that the osteogenic MDA-PCa-118b xenograft expressed higher levels of bone morphogenetic protein
BMP4 and several cytokines including interleukin-8, growth-related protein (GRO), and CCL2. We showed that
BMP4 secreted from MDA-PCa-118b contributed to about a third of the osteogenic differentiation seen in MDAPCa-118b tumors. The conditioned media from MDA-PCa-118b induced a higher level of osteoblast differentiation, which was significantly reduced by treatment with BMP4 neutralizing antibody or the small molecule BMP
receptor 1 inhibitor LDN-193189. BMP4 did not elicit an autocrine effect on MDA-PCa-118b, which expressed
low to undetectable levels of BMP receptors. Treatment of SCID mice bearing MDA-PCa-118b tumors with LDN193189 significantly reduced tumor growth. Thus, these studies support a role of BMP4-mediated osteogenesis in
the progression of prostate cancer in bone. Cancer Res; 71(15); 5194–203. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
Prostate cancer has a propensity to metastasize to bone.
Development of bone metastases substantially shortens survival time of men with prostate cancer and remains a major
challenge in the treatment of prostate cancer. The mechanisms
that lead to the preferential growth of prostate cancer in bone
are not known. Bone metastasis from prostate cancer typically
exhibits osteoblastic lesions (1). In the histopathologic analysis
of prostate cancer bone metastases, a substantial increase in
the numbers of osteoblasts and bone matrix adjacent to
prostate cancer cells are often seen. Whereas metastases have
an overall bone-forming phenotype, the clinical presentation of
prostate cancer bone metastasis suggests that it is a heterogeneous disease that also involves osteoclasts (2, 3). The
complex interactions of tumor cells with osteoblasts, osteoAuthors' Affiliations: Departments of 1Molecular Pathology, 2Genitourinary Medical Oncology, and 3Orthopaedic Oncology, The University of

clasts, and other cells suggest that prostate cancer cells secrete
multiple factors that alter the bone microenvironment and
stimulate osteoblast proliferation and/or differentiation at the
sites of skeletal metastasis (4). Identification of factors that are
involved in the osteoblastic bone lesions will uncover targets
for therapy. However, this has been difficult due to anatomic
inaccessibility, and the small amount of tumor in biopsies from
bone metastasis is not sufficient for biochemical analysis.
Recently, 2 bone metastasis–derived xenografts, MDA-PCa118b and MDA-PCa-133, have been generated, and they provide sufficient material for the analysis of the paracrine factors
that play a role in prostate cancer progression in bone. MDAPCa-118b (PCa-118b) xenograft exhibits characteristics seen
in patients with prostate cancer in bone, for example a strong
osteogenic phenotype when implanted into mouse femurs (5).
Interestingly, PCa-118b induced new bone formation even
when implanted s.c. (5). On the other hand, the MDA-PCa133 (PCa-133) xenograft proliferates when implanted s.c. but
does not induce bone formation. The difference in the boneforming activity of these 2 xenografts reflects the heterogeneous nature of prostate cancer bone metastases (2).
In this study, we identified the factors secreted by these 2
xenografts using an antibody array that detects cytokines in the
conditioned medium. We found that the osteogenic PCa-118b
xenograft not only expresses higher levels of osteogenic factors,
such as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP4) but also osteoclastogenic factors, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein
1 (MCP1) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF),
compared with the PCa-133 xenograft. In addition, BMP4

Osteoblast Regulatory Factors in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis

secreted from PCa-118b induced osteoblast differentiation in a
paracrine fashion. Inhibition of the BMP receptor on osteoblasts by a small molecule inhibitor LDN-193189 reduces PCa118b tumor growth. These studies provide a biochemical basis
for the osteogenic phenotype of PCa-118b and support a role of
osteogenesis in the progression of prostate cancer in bone.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Recombinant human proteins were used: basic fibroblast
growth factors (FGF; FGF-2), BMP2, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP2), and insulin-like growth factor binding
protein 2 (IGFBP-2; R&D), BMP4 (Sigma-Alrich), growthrelated protein (GRO)-a, GRO-b, GRO-g, interleukin (IL)-8
stem cell factor (SCF) and brain-derived neutrophic factor
(BDNF;Cell Science). LDN-193189 was from Axon Medchem
(Netherlands). Prostate cancer xenograft tumors PCa-118b (5)
and PCa-133 were derived from bone lesions of patients with
castration-resistant prostate cancer. Fingerprinting of cells
isolated from PCa-118b and PCa-133 xenografts showed that
their profiles are unique as expected. The PC3 cell line was
confirmed by fingerprinting.
Xenograft tumors and conditioned medium
Subcutaneous grafts of PCa-118b or PCa-133 were generated by implanting fragments (less than 1 mL) of tumors s.c.
into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The
tumors were allowed to grow until they reached the size of
500 mL, dissected, weighed, cut into small pieces, and suspended (250 mg wet weight per mL medium) in BGJb medium
(Invitrogen) with antibiotics. The conditioned media were
collected every 24 hours for 2 days, spun to clarify, and stored
at 80 C.
Assessment of chemokines in conditioned media
Chemokines and cytokines in the conditioned media were
assessed by using RayBio Human Cytokine Antibody Array C
(RayBiotech; Membranes VI and VII) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The signal intensity of each spot was
quantified by ImageJ. The signal intensity of the negative
control was subtracted from each spot. The experiments were
carried out 3 times using conditioned medium from 3 different
batches of xenograft tumors. BMP4 or BMP6 levels were
measured using ELISA kits (RayBiotech).
Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR analysis
Total RNA was extracted from PCa-118b or PCa-133 using
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). The relative mRNA level for
each gene was analyzed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR
(qRT-PCR) with SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems), using
GAPDH as a control.
Measurement of luciferase and alkaline phosphatase
activities in calvarial osteoblasts
The transgenic mice harboring luciferase transgene (Col-luc
mice) were described previously (6). Calvarial osteoblasts from
Col-luc mice or CD1 mice were incubated with conditioned

www.aacrjournals.org

medium from PCa-118b or PCa-133 with or without neutralizing antibody or LDN-193189 for 3 days. Cells were lysed and
the luciferase activity assessed (Promega, Cat. No. E1501).
Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using p-nitrophenyl phosphate liquid substrate system (Sigma–Aldrich).
Measurement of bone morphogenetic protein reporter
activity
C2C12 cells stably expressing a BMP-responsive Id1 promoter fused to a luciferase reporter gene (C2C12/BRA) were
kindly provided by Dr. Daniel B. Rifkin (7). C2C12/BRA cells
were incubated with conditioned medium from PCa-118b or
BMP4 with or without 100 nmol/L LDN-193189 for 12 hours
and the luciferase activity assessed as above.
Western blotting for Smad 5 phosphorylation
Cells in 6-well plates were treated with or without 100
nmol/L LDN-193189 and/or 0.68 ng/mL BMP4 for 16 hours.
LDN-193189 was added 15 minutes before BMP4 addition. Cell
extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by Western
blotting analysis, using phospho-SMAD-1/5 and SMAD-5 antibodies (Cell Signaling).
Effect of LDN-193189 on tumor growth in vivo
In the first experiment, SCID mice were implanted with
MDA-PCa-118b tumors. After 7 days when tumors reached
measurable sizes, mice were injected with LDN-193189
(3 mg/kg) or with vehicle intraperitoneally twice a day. Tumor
sizes and body weights were measured weekly. Mice were
injected with calcein at 3 days and 1 day prior to sacrifice.
Blood was collected and tumors were weighed. A portion of
the tumors were fixed in formaldehyde for micro-computed
tomography (microCT), using EVS CT (General Electric), or
further decalcified for bone histomorphometric analysis, using
OsteoMeasure Analysis System (Osteometrics, Inc.), or flash
frozen for RNA preparation. Osteocalcin in the mouse serum
was determined by ELISA (Biomedical Technologies). In the
second experiment, PCa-118b tumors were first digested with
Accumax (eBioscience), and the isolated cells were plated
overnight, digested by Accutase (eBioscience), resuspended in
Matrigel in 1:1 ratio, and injected into SCID mice (1  106
cells/mouse) s.c. Mice were treated with LDN-193189 5 days
post-injection.
Statistical analysis
Data are expressed as the mean  SD unless otherwise
stated. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student
t-test (2-tailed, paired). P values less than 0.05 were considered
significant.

ectopic new bone formation as shown by radiography,
microCT, histology, and serum osteocalcin (Fig. 1A). MicroCT
analysis showed heterogeneous mineralization with various
densities within the tumor (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the femur/

those in PCa-118b. Calcein labeling shows that the newly
formed bone is irregular. In contrast, the PCa-133 xenograft
did not induce bone formation (Fig. 1B).

a higher level of FGF2, but not FGF4 and FGF9, than PCa118b (Fig. 2B). Both xenografts expressed very low levels of
FGF6 and FGF7 (Fig. 2B).
Other factors that are highly expressed in PCa-118b compared with PCa-133 include GRO (including a, b, and g), IL-8,
TIMP-2, SCF, IGFBP-2, migration inhibitory factor (MIF) MCP1,
M-CSF, soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (sTNF1), and
sTNFRII (Fig. 2C). On the other hand, PCa-133 expressed a
higher level of BDNF compared with PCa-118b (Fig. 2C).

Cytokine array analysis of conditioned medium from
xenografts
The strong bone-forming activity of PCa-118b may be due
to the secretion of paracrine factors that stimulate osteoblast proliferation and/or differentiation. To identify these
factors, we compared the expression of cytokines in the
conditioned medium from PCa-118b and PCa-133 xenografts, using the Human Cytokine Antibody Array that
detects 120 cytokines and growth factors. BMPs and FGFs
are the 2 major families of protein factors that have effects
on osteoblast proliferation and differentiation (8). The cytokine arrays indicate that PCa-118b expressed higher levels of
BMP4 and BMP6 than PCa-133, whereas PCa-133 expressed

BMP4 expression in PCa-118b
To confirm the cytokine array analysis, the levels of BMP
RNA transcripts were determined by qRT-PCR. Of BMP1 to
BMP9 examined, BMP4 was the most highly expressed in PCa118b xenograft. Low levels of BMP3 and BMP6 were also
detected (Fig. 2D). None of these BMP messages were detected
in PCa-133 (data not shown). Further, ELISA assays of the
conditioned medium showed that BMP4 in PCa-118b was 13fold higher than that found in PCa-133 conditioned medium,
with the levels at 624.8  17.3 pg/mL and 47.2  4.3 pg/mL,
respectively (Fig. 2D). BMP6 in PCa-118b was at 62.4  2.6 pg/
mL but too low to be detected in the PCa-133 conditioned
medium (Fig. 2D).

Effect of cytokines and conditioned medium on
osteoblast proliferation and differentiation
Next, we examined the effects of these cytokines on osteoblast proliferation and/or differentiation. To improve the
specificity of the measurement, primary calvarial osteoblasts
isolated from a 2.3-kb collagen promoter driven luciferase
reporter transgenic mice (Col-luc mice) were used (6, 9).
Previous studies have established that the luciferase reporter
activity of the Col-luc osteoblasts correlated with osteoblast
proliferation (9). Treatment with 10 ng/mL FGF2 induces an
elongated spindle shape morphology, an increase in osteoblast
cell number, an increase in luciferase activity, and a small but
significant inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 3A),
showing that FGF2 stimulates Col-luc osteoblast proliferation.
In contrast, treatment with 100 ng/mL BMP2 induces a
significant increase in alkaline phosphatase activity without
affecting the luciferase activity (Fig. 3A), suggesting that BMP2
stimulates Col-luc osteoblast differentiation.
Next, when the Col-luc osteoblasts were treated with recombinant BMP2, BMP4, or BMP6, a significant increase (about
300% compared with the control, n ¼ 3) of alkaline phosphatase activity was observed, with no effect on luciferase activity
(Fig. 3B). In contrast, treatment with 10 ng/mL of FGF2 or FGF9
for 3 days led to an increase in luciferase activity, but a decrease
in alkaline phosphatase activity (Fig. 3B). These observations
suggest that BMP2, BMP4, and BMP6 exert similar effects on
osteoblast differentiation, whereas FGF2 and FGF9 exert similar effects on osteoblast proliferation.
Cytokines, including MIF (Fig. 3B), IGFBP2, BDNF, and
SCF, did not have a significant effect on luciferase or alkaline
phosphatase activity of Col-luc osteoblasts (Table 1). GRO
(including GRO-a, b, and g), IL-8, and TIMP-2, induced small
but significant increases in alkaline phosphatase (Table 1)
but not luciferase activity (data not shown). These observations suggest that these cytokines may be involved, but to a
lesser extent than BMP4, in the osteogenesis of the PCa-118b
xenograft.
Osteoblast regulatory activities in the conditioned
media of PCa-118b and PCa-133 xenografts
Next, the conditioned media from PCa-118b or -133 were
examined for their effects on osteoblast differentiation or
proliferation. Treatment of Col-luc calvarial osteoblasts with
conditioned media from PCa-133 led to a 5-fold increase in
luciferase activity, while PCa-118b xenograft only resulted in
an average of 30% increase (Fig. 3C). In contrast, conditioned
medium from PCa-118b induced about a 2-fold increase in
alkaline phosphatase activity compared with that from PCa133, which induced an average of 15% increase (Fig. 3C).
We further used a neutralizing antibody against BMP4 to
determine if BMP4 might be involved in the increase in
alkaline phosphatase activity seen in the CM of PCa-118b
xenograft. The BMP4 antibody inhibited about 40% of PCa118b-induced increase in alkaline phosphatase activity
(Fig. 3D), whereas control IgG or BMP6 antibody (data not
shown) did not show an inhibitory effect. These observations
suggest that BMP4 plays a significant role in PCa-118binduced osteoblast differentiation.

BMP4 signals through bone morphogenetic protein
receptor in osteoblasts
To examine whether PCa-118b conditioned medium activates BMP signaling in osteoblasts, we first examined its effect
on Id1 promoter activity. Id1 is a direct target of the BMP
pathway, and its promoter contains multiple BMP-specific
SMAD-binding elements (10). The C2C12 cell line expresses
BMP receptors (7) and can be induced to become osteoblasts
by BMP2. C2C12/BRE was generated by transfecting the Id1
promoter reporter into C2C12 cells (7). When the C2C12/BRE
cells were incubated with MDA-PCa-118b conditioned medium, luciferase reporter activity was increased by 5-fold, which
was accompanied by a 3-fold increase in endogenous Id1
message (Fig. 4A). In contrast, conditioned medium from
PCa-133 did not stimulate Id1 promoter activity (Fig. 4B,
bottom). LDN-193189, a small molecule inhibitor of BMP type
I receptor (11), was used to specifically inhibit BMP signaling.
In osteoblasts, LDN-193189 inhibited osteoblast differentiation (Fig. 4), but did not induce osteoblast cell death or inhibit
osteoblast proliferation [data not shown and (11)]. Treatment
of C2C12/BRE cells with 100-nmol/L LDN-193189 led to an
inhibition of BMP4-induced Id1 promoter activity at various
BMP4 concentrations (Fig. 4B, upper panel), suggesting that
LDN-193189 blocks BMP4-induced signaling. Further, LDN193189 also inhibited BMP signaling to the Id1 promoter from
PCa-118b conditioned medium (Fig. 4B, lower panel).
Next, we examined the effect of PCa-118b conditioned
medium on the activation of Smad5, a BMP receptor signaling
molecule. In C2C12/BRE cells, conditioned medium from PCa118b but not PCa-133 induced Smad5 phosphorylation, and
this activity was inhibited by LDN-193189 (Fig. 4C). Similar
results were observed using calvarial mouse osteoblasts
(Fig. 4C). These observations suggest that PCa-118b conditioned medium activated Smad5 signaling through the BMP
receptors.
We further examined the effect of LDN-193189 on conditioned medium-mediated osteoblast activity. PCa-118b conditioned medium-induced alkaline phosphatase activity was
significantly reduced (about 50%) by treating the osteoblasts
with 100-nmol/L LDN-193189 (Fig. 4D), consistent with the
inhibition observed with BMP4 neutralizing antibody
(Fig. 3D). LDN-193189, at a concentration of 100 nmol/L,
had no effect on osteoblast cell number (data not shown),
indicating that the inhibition of alkaline phosphatase activity
by LDN-193189 is not due to toxicity. Together, these results
suggest that PCa-118b conditioned medium activates BMP
receptor signaling in osteoblasts, and this effect is inhibited by
the BMP type I receptor inhibitor LDN-193189.
Expression of bone morphogenetic protein receptors in
PCa-118b
Whereas the results showed that PCa-118b tumor secretes
BMP4 to induce osteoblast differentiation in a paracrine
fashion, it is not clear whether BMP4 may have an autocrine
effect on PCa-118b tumor cells. To examine this possibility, we
digested the PCa-118b tumor and cultured the isolated cells in
CnT-52 medium that allows tumor cell but not osteoblast
survival (data not shown). Under this condition, we did not

detect phosphorylated Smad5 in BMP4-secreting PCa-118b
cells, even after further BMP4 addition (Fig. 5A). In addition,
LDN-193189 did not affect the expression of BMP4 target gene
Id2 as well as BMP4 expression in PCa-118b cells (ref. 12;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Consistent with a lack of response to
endogenous or exogenous BMP4, PCa-118b cells did not
express significant levels of BMP type I receptors, such as
ALK2, ALK3, and ALK6 (Fig. 5B) or BMP type II receptors, such
as BMPR2 and ACVR2 (Fig. 5C). In contrast, Smad5 was
activated in PC-3 cells and this activation was inhibited by
LDN-193189 treatment (Fig. 5A). PC-3 cells were also found to
express significant levels of BMP type-I and -II receptors
(Fig. 5B and 5C). Together, these results suggest that BMP4
secreted from PCa-118b likely has minimal autocrine effects
on PCa-118b cells.

Effect of LDN-193189 on PCa-118b tumor growth in vivo
Our studies suggest that BMP4 is one of the principal
paracrine factors that increases osteoblast differentiation in
PCa-118b tumors. To assess the effect of BMP4-mediated
osteoblast differentiation on PCa-118b tumor growth in vivo,
we tested the effect of LDN-193189 on PCa-118b xenograft

became palpable 7 days post-implantation. The growth rates
between the control vehicle– and LDN-193189–treated mice
were not significantly different after the first 5 weeks, but
differences in the growth rates were detected 6 and 7 weeks
after treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). In the second experiment, cells were isolated from PCa-118b tumors and injected
s.c. into SCID mice (1  106 cells per mouse). LDN-193189 or
vehicle was applied to mice 5 days after tumor cell injection
before tumors were palpable. The differences in the average
growth rates between these 2 groups, as measured by tumor
size, were significant 6 and 7 weeks after treatment (Fig. 6A).
The tumor weights also showed significant differences at the
termination of the study at week 7 (Fig. 6A). The X-ray of the
tumors showed that the ectopic bone volume and bone
density were reduced in the tumors of the LDN-193189-treated

www.aacrjournals.org

group compared with that of controls (Fig. 6B). Quantitative
determination of the bone volume by microCT, using a threshold of 300 as the cut-off for bone density measurement,
showed that LDN-193189 treatment reduced the bone volume
in the tumors (Fig. 6B). Serum osteocalcin levels of the PCa118b tumor-bearing mice were significantly higher than those
in the non–tumor-bearing mice (Fig. 6C). The levels of osteocalcin in the LDN-193189-treated group were reduced compared with those without the treatment (Fig. 6C). Together,
these observations suggest that treating PCa-118b tumorbearing mice with LDN-193189 led to reduced bone formation
and attenuated tumor growth rate. Quantitative RT-PCR for
mouse osterix, Runx2, alkaline phosphatase as a measurement
for osteoblast cells in the tumors showed that there were no
differences in both control and LDN treated groups (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that LDN-193189 reduces bone
formation but does not change the proportion of mature
osteoblasts in the tumor. A similar experiment was carried
out with PCa-133. We found that LDN-193189 has no effect on
PCa-133 tumor growth. There is no evidence of bone formation in the PCa-133 tumors as measured by microCT. Further,
LDN-193189 treatment did not affect serum osteocalcin levels
(Supplementary Fig. S4).

Discussion
Although prostate cancer bone metastasis is frequently
associated with new bone formation, it is not clear whether
tumor-induced osteogenesis plays a role in prostate cancer
progression in the bone. We postulated that prostate cancer
cells secrete paracrine factors that lead to an increase in bone
formation, and the newly formed bone in turn secretes factors
to enhance prostate cancer progression in bone (4). We have
identified several cytokines that are differentially expressed
between the osteogenic xenograft PCa-118b and nonosteogenic xenograft PCa-133. We showed that BMP4 is one of the
cytokines that play a role in the osteogenesis of the PCa-118b
xenograft. Because PCa-118b does not express BMP receptors,
this has allowed us to explore whether blocking BMP4induced osteogenesis affects PCa-118b tumor growth. We
showed that BMP4-induced osteoblast differentiation was
reduced by the BMP receptor kinase inhibitor LDN-193189,
which resulted in a decrease in PCa-118b tumor growth. These
studies thus provide evidence that tumor-induced osteogenesis mediated by paracrine BMP signaling plays a role in
supporting PCa progression in bone (Fig. 6D), and supports
our previously proposed model that osteoblast activation,
resulting from prostate cancer paracrine signaling, leads to
prostate cancer cell growth in bone (4).
Our observations raised an interesting question about the
mechanism of decreased tumor growth upon reduction of
osteogenic support by LDN-193189 treatment. We did not find
significant differences in tumor-cell proliferation and apoptosis, using Ki67 staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling assays, respectively,
in the control versus LDN-193189–treated PCa-118b tumors
(data not shown). Our interpretation is that tumor-cell
growth and osteoblast differentiation are interdependent

Figure 6. LDN-193189 treatment attenuates PCa-118b tumor growth in vivo. A, cells were isolated from PCa-118b tumors, mixed 1:1 with Matrigel, and
injected into SCID mice subcutaneously (1  106 cells per mouse). LDN-193189 or vehicle treatment was started 5 days post-tumor cell injection. Tumor sizes
were measured weekly. At week 7, tumors were removed and weighed. B, tumors from vehicle and LDN-193189–treated groups were X-rayed. Bone volumes
were determined by microCT (mCT) using a 300 value as the cut-off. C, serum osteocalcin levels were determined for non–tumor-bearing (n ¼ 5),
PCa-118b tumor bearing (n ¼ 10), and PCa-118b tumor bearing but LDN-193189–treated (n ¼ 10) mice. D, model of bidirectional effect between
PCa-118b osteogenic tumor and osteoblasts. PCa-118b secretes BMP4 that induces osteoblast differentiation. Inhibition of the paracrine BMP4 effect on
osteoblasts leads to the attenuation of PCa-118b tumor growth, suggesting that osteoblasts play a role in supporting PCa-118b tumor growth.

during PCa-118b tumor growth. Thus, LDN-193189 treatment
resulted in a proportional decrease of both types of cells. We
speculate that the interdependency of tumor cells and osteoblasts involves a wide spectrum of secreted factors mediating
paracrine/autocrine signaling, and that LDN-193189 partially
interrupted such an interdependency. Our studies suggest that
LDN-193189 treatment led to a decrease in bone formation, as
reflected in serum osteocalcin levels, and this resulted in a
decrease in tumor volume due to the tumor/osteoblast interdependency.
Bone metastases of prostate cancer predominantly result
in osteoblastic lesions. However, very few cell lines or
xenografts generated from human prostate cancer bone
metastasis exhibit this phenotype. MDA-PCa-118b is one
of the few xenografts that elicit a strong osteogenic phenotype when implanted in SCID mice (5). How MDA-PCa-118b
induces ectopic bone formation under the s.c. site is not
clear. It is likely that MDA-PCa-118b secretes several factors
that are able to stimulate osteoblast proliferation or differentiation. Indeed, in a search for these secreted factors
(prostate cancer secretome), we showed that several factors,
including BMP4 secreted by MDA-PCa-118b, are able to
stimulate osteoblast differentiation. In addition, previous

5202

Cancer Res; 71(15) August 1, 2011

studies by Li and colleagues (5) showed that FGF9, which
stimulates osteoblast proliferation, also contributes to the
osteoblastic phenotype of MDA-PCa-118b. Other factors yet
to be identified may also be involved in the osteoblastic
phenotype of MDA-PCa-118b tumor.
Many prostate cancer–derived cell lines express BMP receptors and BMPs. Several reports have shown that BMPs have
autocrine effects on prostate cancer cells. Feeley and colleagues (13, 14) showed that BMP2 stimulated PC-3 and LAPC4
cell migration and invasion. Similarly, BMPs increased the in
vitro invasive ability of LuCaP23.1 and C4-2B cells (15, 16). Dai
and colleagues (16) also showed that BMPs induced VEGF
protein and mRNA expression in C4-2B cells. MDA-PCa-118b
is unique in that it expresses low to undetectable BMP
receptors and does not respond to BMP4. Thus, the effect
of LDN-198183 on tumor growth is most likely due to the
blocking of BMP4 paracrine effects on tumor stromal cells
(Fig. 6D). This property allowed us to examine, for the first
time, the effect of tumor-induced osteogenesis on prostate
tumor growth.
The ectopic bone formation of MDA-PCa-118b xenograft
under the s.c. site suggests that host stromal cells/osteoblasts
are recruited to the s.c. tumor implants. Indeed, a previous

Osteoblast Regulatory Factors in Prostate Cancer Bone Metastasis

study using in situ hybridization with mouse-specific probes
indicated that the osteoblasts present in the xenograft are of
mouse origin (5). How the stromal cells/osteoblasts are
recruited to the ectopically implanted tumor remains to be
determined.
Despite the bone-forming phenotype in prostate cancer
bone metastasis, pathologic analysis of the metastatic lesions
in bone showed that both osteoblastic and osteolytic lesions
are present in the same loci (17, 18). Histomorphometric
quantification also consistently shows changes in both bone
formation and resorption within metastatic foci in iliac crest
biopsy samples (19). Consistent with the clinical observations,
osteoclasts were also present in MDA-PCa-118b xenograft
tumors (5). Thus, tumor-induced osteoblastic or osteolytic
responses likely reflect the overall effects from factors
that regulate osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and
osteoclast activation in vivo. Among the factors secreted from
MDA-PCa-118b xenografts, MCP-1, M-CSF, and IL-8 have been
shown to have effects on osteoclast activation (20–22). It is
likely that other factors yet to be identified are also involved in
the osteoclastic component in MDA-PCa-118b xenografts.
In conclusion, MDA-PCa-118b exhibits the unique properties that allow examination of the contribution of paracrine

signaling in osteoblastic lesions of prostate cancer. We show
that BMP4, an osteogenic factor, acts as one of the important
paracrine factors. By modulating BMP4-mediated paracrine
signaling, we found evidence that supports a role of osteogenesis in the progression of prostate cancer in bone.
Further studies on the factors that induce osteogenesis in
prostate cancer bone metastasis are warranted.
