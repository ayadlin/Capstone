Abstract
Although Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) intravesical therapy is a standard treatment for bladder cancer, eventual failure of response is a major problem. Treatments that can
augment BCG therapy are urgently needed. We investigated
whether curcumin, a component of Curcuma longa (also
called turmeric), has potential to improve the current therapy using in vitro and in vivo MBT-2 murine tumor models. We
found that curcumin potentiated BCG-induced apoptosis of
human bladder cancer cells. BCG stimulated the release of
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand
(TRAIL) from peripheral mononuclear neutrophils in a doseand time-dependent manner, whereas curcumin enhanced
the upregulation of TRAIL receptors. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that curcumin also suppressed the
BCG-induced activation of the cell survival transcription factor NF-κB. In a syngeneic bladder cancer model, curcumin
alone reduced the bladder tumor volume, but a significantly
greater reduction was observed when BCG and curcumin
were used in combination (P < 0.0001 versus control; P <
0.003 versus BCG alone). This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the proliferation marker Ki-67 (P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG alone) and microvessel
density (CD31; P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG
alone), decreased NF-κB in tumor tissue compared with the
control, induced apoptosis, and decreased cyclin D1, vascular
endothelial growth factor, cyclooxygenase-2, c-myc, and Bcl-2
expression in the tumor tissue. Upregulation of TRAIL receptor by the combination was also observed in tumor tissues.
Overall, our results suggest that curcumin potentiates the
antitumor effect of BCG through the inhibition of NF-κB and
induction of TRAIL receptors in bladder cancer cells. [Cancer

world (1). The mainstay of therapy for the majority of patients is
complete transurethral resection of tumor followed by intravesical
instillation of antitumor agents. Intravesical instillation of Bacillus
Calmette-Guerin (BCG) was first used for bladder cancer therapy
in 1974 (2); to date, it is the most successful adjuvant agent for
treating noninvasive bladder cancer (3). Nonetheless, treatment
failure is common, so intense researches into methods of augmenting this response are under way.
It has long been believed that the mechanism of action of intravesical BCG instillation was due to nonspecific inflammation in the
bladder (4). It is generally accepted that the majority of activity
shown by BCG is due to stimulation of the local immune system
and recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes
(PMN) and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-12 (5).
Under inflammatory conditions, PMN may promote tumor growth
and progression, whereas, in the context of therapeutic interventions, they can exert important antitumor functions. Although
the exact mechanisms of PMN-mediated activation of tumor immunity are poorly defined, it has been suggested that release of
tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
from PMNs is a key step in the antitumor effect of BCG therapy
(6). It has been shown that patients who have a response from
BCG therapy have higher urinary TRAIL levels, and this TRAIL is
able to induce apoptosis in bladder cancer cells in vitro. Furthermore, flow cytometry of fresh urine suggests that this TRAIL comes
from PMNs in the urine of patients (6).
Curcumin (diferuloylmethane) is a major constituent of the yellow spice turmeric derived from the rhizomes of Curcuma longa.
It is safe and nontoxic and has demonstrable antitumor, antiinflammatory, apoptotic, and antioxidant properties. We have
shown previously that curcumin inhibits tumor metastasis, invasion, and angiogenesis (7–9). These data suggest that curcumin
regulates multiple signaling pathways and possesses several therapeutic benefits. In this study, our purpose is to show that curcumin
also upregulates DR5 in bladder cancer cells and in tumor tissue
and this leads to potentiation of the effect of BCG through production of TRAIL.

Materials and Methods
Reagents. Curcumin with purity >95% was obtained from Synthite Chemicals. BCG, a lyophilized preparation containing 1 × 108 to 8 × 108 colonyforming units (CFU), was resuspended in PBS. Polyclonal antibodies

were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies against cleaved
caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-8 were purchased from Cell Signaling. The
liquid DAB+ substrate chromogen system-horseradish peroxidase used for
immunocytochemistry was obtained from DakoCytomation. Penicillin,
streptomycin, MEM, and fetal bovine serum were obtained from Invitrogen.

Area of the National Cancer Institute-Frederick Cancer Research and Development Center. The animals were housed four per cage in a specific
pathogen-free animal facility and fed with regular chow diet with water
ad libitum. Our experimental protocol was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Neutrophil stimulation with BCG. Unstimulated PMNs (3 × 106/mL)
and PMNs stimulated with cycloheximide (10 μg/mL, 1 h) were incubated

Live/dead assay. This assay was done as described previously (14).
Cell cycle analysis. To determine the effect of curcumin on BCGstimulated PMN on cell cycle analysis, we used propidium iodide/
fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. PMNs (5 × 106/mL) were incubated in the absence or presence of BCG (106 CFU) in polypropylene tubes
for 24 h, after which the supernatant was recovered by centrifugation. The

HBSS. Only single-cell suspensions with >90% viability were used for injections. Single-cell suspensions containing 2 × 105 MBT-2 cells in 0.1 mL
HBSS were injected s.c. into both flanks of each mouse. Mice were randomized into the following treatment groups (n = 9): (a) untreated control
(corn oil, 100 μL/d); (b) curcumin alone (1 g/kg), once daily, orally; (c)
BCG (106 CFU), once weekly, intratumor injection; and (d) combination
of curcumin (1 g/kg), once daily, orally, and BCG (106 CFU), once weekly,
intratumorally. Therapy was continued for 4 weeks. Tumors were enumerated by inspection and palpation, and tumor dimensions were measured
by Vernier caliper. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula: (shortest diameter)2 × (longest diameter) / 2. On the 30th day, mice in all groups
were sacrificed. Tumor volumes were compared among groups using unpaired Student's t test.
Ki-67 immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
sections were stained with anti–Ki-67 (rabbit monoclonal clone SP6;
Thermo Scientific) antibody as described previously (15). Results were
expressed as percentage ± SE of Ki-67–positive cells per ×40 magnification field. A total of ten ×40 fields was examined and counted from each
group.
Tumor microvessel density. Microvessel density was used as a marker
for tumor angiogenesis. Frozen sections were fixed in formalin and stained
with an antibody to CD31 (Pharmingen) as described previously (15). The
density of vessels was determined by counting the number of vessels per
high-power field (×100) in four areas of each tumor section. Results were
expressed as the mean ± SE number of vessels per high-power field. A total
of 20 high-power fields was examined and counted from three tumors of
each of the treatment groups.

Quantification of apoptosis in tumor sections. Apoptotic cells in tumor samples were quantified by fluorescent terminal deoxynucleotidyl
transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling using a commercial kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunofluorescence
microscopy was done using a Zeiss Plan-Neofluar lens on an epifluorescence microscope and captured image using a cooled CCD camera. DNA
fragmentation was detected by localized green fluorescence within the
nucleus of apoptotic cells. For total terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling expression, apoptotic events were quantified manually (16).
Immunohistochemical analysis for VEGF, COX-2, p65, cyclin D1,
and DR5 in tumor tissues. The nuclear localization of p65 and the expression of VEGF, COX-2, cyclin D1, and DR5 were evaluated using an immunohistochemical method described previously (17).
Statistics. All experiments were done as at least three independent
assays. The values were compared using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett's
multiple comparison post-test.

Results
The goal of this study is to determine whether curcumin potentiates the activity of BCG against bladder cancer. For this, we
used in vitro and in vivo model systems to investigate the effect of
curcumin on BCG activity. Because BCG mediates its effects
through activation of PMN, freshly isolated human PMNs were
used for these studies.

Curcumin potentiates the apoptotic and antiproliferative
effects of BCG in bladder cancer cells. We first investigated
the effect of curcumin on PMN-BCG–induced apoptosis by intracellular esterase activity method that examined plasma membrane integrity. These results showed that whereas BCG and
PMN alone had little effect on apoptosis, together they induced
significant apoptosis and curcumin enhanced the apoptotic
effects of PMN-BCG from 43% to 74% against bladder cancer cells
(Fig. 1A).
We also investigated the effect of curcumin on cell viability
affected by PMN-BCG by the MTT method that examines the
mitochondrial activity. Results showed that curcumin significantly
enhanced the antiproliferative effects of BCG (Fig. 1B). When
examined by sub-G0-G1 fraction by fluorescence-activated cell sorting, curcumin enhanced apoptosis by BCG from 30% to ∼80%
(Fig. 1C, left).
When apoptosis was examined by Annexin V method, curcumin
enhanced apoptosis from 40% to >80% (Fig. 1C, right). We also examined apoptosis by activation of caspase-8 and caspase-3. Highly
significant apoptosis was produced only when curcumin was used
in combination with BCG (Fig. 1D). All these results together suggest that curcumin can potentiate the apoptotic effect of BCG
against bladder cancer cells.
Stimulation of PMN with BCG results in TRAIL/Apo-2L expression. How BCG, a standard treatment for bladder cancer, induces apoptosis is not known. Induction of TRAIL by PMN, a
potent apoptosis-inducing cytokine, has been described as one of
the mechanisms (6, 18). Whether BCG induces apoptosis in our

system through induction of TRAIL was examined. Unstimulated
or stimulated PMNs were treated with BCG for 4 h and supernatants were analyzed for soluble TRAIL/Apo-2L using ELISA. We
found that there was an increase in TRAIL/Apo-2L in all groups
of neutrophils stimulated with BCG and that the soluble TRAIL increased with BCG dose (Fig. 2A, top).
To further examine the response of neutrophils to BCG stimulation, we analyzed the response for different periods and different
doses of BCG. Soluble TRAIL/Apo-2L increased with BCG stimulation throughout the 24 h of exposure in a time-dependent manner
(Fig. 2A, bottom).
Curcumin does not modulate the production of TRAIL/Apo2L by BCG-stimulated PMN. Next, we also examined what is the
effect of curcumin on BCG-stimulated production of TRAIL in
PMNs. Unstimulated and stimulated PMNs were pretreated with
curcumin for 4 h, and then incubated with BCG for 24 h. The
supernatants were analyzed for TRAIL. As shown in Fig. 2A,
BCG increased the level of TRAIL in PMNs in a dose- and timedependent manner. To exclude the role of de novo protein synthesis, we also examined the effect of protein synthesis inhibitor
cycloheximide on production of TRAIL (18, 19). We have found
that presence of cycloheximide did not inhibit the production of
TRAIL, indicating that protein synthesis is not involved. TRAIL
production, however, was slightly enhanced.
Whether curcumin modulate BCG-stimulated soluble TRAIL
production from PMNs was also examined. We found that curcumin had no effect on BCG-induced production of TRAIL from
PMNs (Fig. 2B).

Curcumin Potentiates the Effects of BCG via TRAIL

Ki-67–positive cells in bladder tumor indicated that curcumin alone and in combination with BCG suppressed cell proliferation; right, quantification of Ki-67

analysis of murine tumors indicates induction of apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated dUTP nick end labeling and CD31) and
NF-κB–dependent gene products in tumors treated with curcumin and BCG. Green fluorescence indicated apoptosis and red fluorescence indicated
microvessel density (CD31+ cells). Percentage, positive staining for the given biomarker. D, immunohistochemical analysis of DR5 showed the upregulation of DR5
by curcumin alone or in combination with BCG.

Curcumin upregulates TRAIL receptor (DR5) in various
cancer cells. To assess the molecular mechanisms underlying
the potentiation of BCG-induced apoptosis by curcumin in bladder
cancer cells, we examined its effect on the expression of DR5, one
of the major receptors for TRAIL, by fluorescence-activated cell
sorting analysis. Increased fluorescent intensity of DR5 staining
was observed in treated versus untreated cells, which increased
with increasing concentration of curcumin (Fig. 2C). Curcumin induced the expression of DR5 protein in a dose-dependent manner
on all bladder cancer cell lines. We also examined the effect of curcumin on induction of DR5 by Western blot analysis. These results
also confirmed the induction of DR5 by curcumin (Fig. 2D).
Curcumin inhibits BCG-induced NF-κB activation in bladder cancer cells in vitro. Interaction of BCG mycobacteria with
cells often accompanies the activation of the transcription factor
NF-κB (20, 21). This NF-κB activation has been shown to suppress
the apoptotic effect of TRAIL (22). Whether curcumin potentiates
BCG-mediated apoptosis through downregulation of NF-κB was
examined. Our results show that BCG can induce NF-κB in a
time-dependent (Fig. 3A) and dose-dependent (Fig. 3B) manner
in two different bladder cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we found
that curcumin downregulated BCG-induced NF-κB activation in a
dose-dependent manner in both cell lines (Fig. 3C).
Curcumin potentiates the antitumor effects of BCG in murine tumors in C3H mice. Based on the studies described above,

www.aacrjournals.org

we investigated the effect of curcumin on the antitumor effects of
BCG in mice. BCG requires an immunocompetent in vivo model to
show efficacy, presumably because it requires functioning immune
competent cells such as PMNs. Therefore, we investigated the effects of curcumin on the antitumor activity of BCG in a syngeneic
mouse model. We examined the effects of curcumin alone, BCG
alone, and the combination of the two in vivo in C3H mice implanted with MBT-2 bladder cancer cells (Fig. 4A). On day 0,
MBT-2 cells were injected s.c. into both flanks of mice. Curcumin
therapy was started on day 1 and BCG on day 3. At indicated time
intervals, tumor volume was measured by Vernier calipers. The tumor volume was reduced in curcumin- and BCG-treated groups
and in those given the combination. BCG alone reduced tumor
growth; growth was further reduced by the combination treatment
(Fig. 4B). All animals were sacrificed on the 30th day. The final tumor volumes on day 30 after the start of treatment showed significant decrease in the curcumin + BCG group (67 mm3) compared
with control (2598 mm3; P < 0.0001 versus control) or with BCG
alone (419 mm3; P < 0.003 versus BCG; Fig. 4C). The tumor volumes
in curcumin alone group was not statistically significant compared
with control group (P = 0.197).
Curcumin inhibits biomarkers of proliferation and angiogenesis in the tumors. To investigate the mechanisms by which
curcumin manifests its effects against bladder cancer, we examined the expression of Ki-67, a biomarker for growth of tumors,

and CD31, a biomarker for microvessel density in tumor tissues, by
immunohistochemistry. Results in Fig. 5A showed that both curcumin and BCG, when compared with the untreated control, decreased the expression of Ki-67 to a similar extent, but the
maximum decrease was noted when the two agents were used in
combination (P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG alone).
Curcumin and BCG were equally effective in decreasing CD31 expression, and the two in combination were maximally effective
(Fig. 5B; P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG alone).
Curcumin potentiates BCG-induced apoptosis in the tumor
tissue. As shown in Fig. 5C, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–
mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining indicated that whereas
treatment with curcumin and BCG alone did induce apoptosis,
combination therapy had the greatest effect. We used fluorescent
staining with CD31 to indicate that the combination therapy not
only increased apoptosis (green) but also resulted in lower microvessel density (red) in the same region of the tumor tissue, indicating that curcumin potentiated the apoptotic effects of BCG as well
as reducing angiogenesis.
Curcumin decreases cyclin D1 expression in the tumor tissue.
Whether curcumin can affect the cyclin D1 expression, another proliferation marker, in the tumor tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 5C, curcumin and BCG alone reduced
the expression of cyclin D1 to 53% and 58% of vehicle control, respectively. The two agents together, however, reduced the expression by 90% (P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG alone)
in the tumor tissue.
Curcumin decreases COX-2 expression in the tumor tissue.
Whether curcumin can affect the COX-2 expression, a marker for
inflammation, in the tumor tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 5C, curcumin and BCG alone reduced
the expression of COX-2 to 35% and 46% of vehicle control, respectively. The two agents together, however, reduced the expression
by 96% (P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG alone) in
the tumor tissue.
Curcumin decreases VEGF expression in the tumor tissue.
Whether curcumin can affect the VEGF expression, a marker for
angiogenesis, in the tumor tissue was examined by immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 5C, curcumin and BCG alone reduced
the expression of VEGF to 63% and 73% of vehicle control, respectively. The two agents together, however, reduced the expression
by 87% (P < 0.01 versus control; P < 0.01 versus BCG alone) in
the tumor tissue.
Curcumin increases DR5 expression in the tumor tissue. To
test our hypothesis in the animal model, we assessed whether curcumin upregulates DR5 expression in tumor tissues as studied by
immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 5D, curcumin and BCG
together increases the upregulation of DR5 (P < 0.01 versus control;
P < 0.01 versus BCG alone).
Curcumin inhibits NF-κB and downregulates the NF-κB–
regulated gene products in tumor tissues. NF-κB expression
has been linked with survival, proliferation, and angiogenesis. Here,
we examined the effects of therapy on its expression using immunohistochemistry. As shown in Fig. 6A, curcumin alone reduced
the expression of NF-κB by 90%, whereas BCG alone had no significant effect. Two agents together reduced the expression by 94% in
the tumor tissue.
We also analyzed the effect of curcumin and BCG on NF-κB in
tumor tissues by EMSA. Curcumin completely downregulated the
NF-κB DNA-binding activity in tumor tissue, whereas and BCG had

alone, and the combination on the expression of genes involved
in tumor cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and survivin), proliferation
(c-myc), inflammation (COX-2), and angiogenesis (VEGF). Western
blot results indicated that curcumin alone downregulated the expression of all these proteins whether alone or with BCG (Fig. 6C).
These data are in agreement with the immunohistochemical analysis (Fig. 5C).

Discussion
Although BCG treatment has been improved incrementally
through dose modifications, changes in schedule, and symptomatic
treatment of side effects (23), there has not been substantial improvement largely because of poor understanding of its mechanism of action. Here, we present a mechanism-based rationale
for combination therapy of BCG with curcumin. Our results suggest that the effects of BCG therapy mediated via release of TRAIL
from PMNs can be enhanced by curcumin. The latter enhances
BCG-induced apoptosis through upregulation of death receptors,
suppression of NF-κB activation, and inhibition of angiogenesis,
all of which translates into decreased tumor volumes.
Recent advances have shed light on the potential mode of action
of BCG via release of TRAIL from PMNs in the bladder and subsequent apoptosis of bladder cancer cells (6). However, not all tumors respond to this treatment, so agents that can enhance
response to BCG are required. We found that PMNs exposed to
BCG do indeed release soluble TRAIL into the supernatant. When
the supernatant is added to bladder cancer cell lines in vitro, it resulted in decreased cell proliferation and apoptosis. The addition
of curcumin increased the number of cells undergoing apoptosis,

Curcumin Potentiates the Effects of BCG via TRAIL

an event that was accompanied by marked activation of caspases.
Caspase activation plays pivotal roles in both mitochondria and
death receptor–mediated pathways. The activation of caspase8 has been shown to play an important role in both mitochondria
and death receptor–mediated pathways and is mediated by the increased expression of a death receptor and/or ligation of a receptor
with its ligand (24). We found that curcumin treatment enhanced
the BCG-induced activation of both caspase-8 and caspase-3.
We found that curcumin upregulated DR5 expression in bladder
cancer cell lines. The induced expression of DR5 correlated with
curcumin-induced apoptosis. Recently, these death receptors have
attracted much more attention because their ligand preferentially
induces apoptosis in transformed cells showing potential as a tumorselective apoptosis-inducing cytokine for cancer treatment (25). DR5
can be regulated by several factors including p53, NF-κB, c-Jun NH2terminal kinase, and CAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous
protein (26–29).
We also explored whether BCG itself can activate NF-κB in tumor cells because this is one avenue whereby certain tumor cells
escape apoptosis. We were able to show activation of NF-κB by
BCG and curcumin suppressed this activation, showing yet another
reason why the combination might be relevant in the clinical situation. Inhibition of NF-κB activation by curcumin has been thought
to enhance apoptosis induction and mediate anti-inflammatory
effects (30, 31).
We found that curcumin upregulated DR5 expression and downregulated NF-κB–regulated cancer cell survival proteins (e.g., Bcl-2,
Bcl-xL, and survivin) in both in vitro and in vivo. These observations
are in contradictions to the report that TRAIL receptors including
DR5 are transcriptionally regulated by NF-κB (32). Although curcumin can inhibit NF-κB activation, the upregulation of DR5 by curcumin has been shown to be mediated through activation of CAAT/
enhancer-binding protein homologous protein in human renal
cancer cells (33). Our results are in agreement with a report that
curcumin suppressed NF-κB activation but upregulated DR5 expression at the same time, which led to the sensitization of cancer cells
against TRAIL (34, 35). The constitutive activation of NF-κB has been
implicated in TRAIL resistance and this resistance can be reversed
by suppression of NF-κB in human pancreatic cancer cells (36).
In an immunocompetent mouse model, BCG reduced tumor volume, and its effects were enhanced by coadministration of curcumin. Immunohistochemical analysis of murine tumors indicates
that the inhibition of cell proliferation, induction of apoptosis, upregulation of DR5, and decreased VEGF and microvessel density were
most pronounced in the tumors of mice treated with combination
BCG plus curcumin. Curcumin inhibits the expression of NFκB–dependent gene products cyclin D1, COX-2, and VEGF in tumors.
Our results indicate that BCG treatment generates conflicting
signals by activating both proapoptotic (release of TRAIL) and

antiapoptotic signaling. It seems that the proapoptotic signaling
(TRAIL) can overcome the activation of antiapoptotic signaling,
leading to the induction of apoptosis and enhancement of
TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Recently, it was shown that myc interferes with the TRAIL-dependent NF-κB–mediated transcriptional
activation of prosurvival genes such as Mcl-1 and cellular inhibitor
of apoptosis protein-2 (37). TRAIL functions as a DR5 ligand and
rapidly induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells but is
not cytotoxic in normal cells in vitro and in vivo (25). Therefore,
TRAIL is considered to be a tumor-selective, apoptosis-inducing
cytokine and is being evaluated in clinical trials as a new candidate
for cancer treatment. Overexpression of Bcl-2 inhibits TRAILinduced apoptosis, although it has been proposed that Bcl-2 provides only a partial protection at lower doses of TRAIL and not at
higher concentrations (38). We found that curcumin inhibited Bcl-2
levels both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanisms of TRAIL resistance and
ways to overcome these by targeted agents that either neutralize
apoptotic blockades or suppress prosurvival signals also triggered
by TRAIL are the subject of intense drug development, including
molecules such as inhibitors of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins,
Bcl-2 family members, and modulators of NF-κB and epidermal
growth factor receptor signaling (38). Although combined treatment with standard chemotherapeutics or targeted agents may
be an option to increase the efficacy of TRAIL therapy, the ideal
combination would be one that does not carry any added toxicity.
It should be noted that BCG is the most effective therapy for
bladder cancer and is able to treat even unresected tumors in
the human patient (e.g., carcinoma in situ). To date, no therapy
has shown added benefit over BCG alone (other than a randomized
trial of BCG plus chemotherapy, with its ensuing problems). Thus,
the finding that the combination of curcumin and BCG was more
effective than BCG alone is remarkable. In conclusion, we provide a
novel mechanistic-based rationale for combining curcumin, which
is nontoxic and safe for oral ingestion, with BCG for bladder cancer
therapy. We have shown that this is effective in the murine model
and propose that this combination be tested in clinical trials.
