ABSTRACT
Oxaliplatin belongs to the platinum-based drug family and has shown promise in
cancer treatment. The major mechanism of action of platinum compounds is to form
platinum–DNA adducts, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis. Accumulating evidence
suggests that they might also target non-DNA molecules for their apoptotic activity.
We explored the effects of oxaliplatin on a tumor-associated NADH oxidase (tNOX)
in gastric cancer lines. In AGS cells, we found that the oxaliplatin-inhibited tNOX
effectively attenuated the NAD+/NADH ratio and reduced the deacetylase activity of an
NAD+-dependent sirtuin 1, thereby enhancing p53 acetylation and apoptosis. Similar
results were also observed in tNOX-knockdown AGS cells. In the more aggressive
MKN45 and TMK-1 lines, oxaliplatin did not inhibit tNOX, and induced only minimal
apoptosis and cytotoxicity. However, the downregulation of either sirtuin 1 or tNOX
sensitized TMK-1 cells to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis. Moreover, tNOX-depletion in
these resistant cells enhanced spontaneous apoptosis, reduced cyclin D expression
and prolonged the cell cycle, resulting in diminished cancer cell growth. Together,
our results demonstrate that oxaliplatin targets tNOX and SIRT1, and that the tNOXNAD+-sirtuin 1 axis is essential for oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis.

INTRODUCTION

We previously identified a tumor-associated
NADH oxidase (tNOX, ENOX2) that oxidizes NADH
or hydroquinones to the oxidized NAD+ form, and
demonstrated that it is involved in regulating cancer cell
growth [5–8]. This activity was also detected in pooled
sera from cancer patients but not healthy volunteers,
making tNOX an attractive target for translational
medicine research [9–11]. Interestingly, tNOX has
shown potential as a target for various anti-cancer
drugs, including capsaicin [12], EGCg [13], adriamycin
(doxorubicin) [14, 15], phenoxodiol [16], and most
recently
the
4,11-diaminoanthra[2,3-b]furan-5,10diones [17]. The therapeutic targeting of tNOX can inhibit
cell growth and induce apoptosis in transformed cells but
not in non-cancer cells [12, 13, 17], and forced depletion
of tNOX has been shown to enhance the sensitivity

Cisplatin belongs to a family of platinum-based
compounds that has been used as a chemotherapeutic
drug for many types of cancer [1]. However, because of
unexpected side effects and drug resistance, other platinumbased compounds have been developed. One such drug,
oxaliplatin, is a third-generation platinum compound that
has shown promise in the treatment of colon and pancreatic
cancers [1]. The major action mechanism of platinum
compounds is considered to be their ability to bind DNA
and form platinum–DNA adducts, leading to DNA damage
and apoptosis [2]. In addition to their primary DNA targets,
the platinum-based drug compounds are thought to target
non-DNA molecules, thereby contributing to their proapoptotic effects and cytotoxicity [3, 4].

The tNOX-mediated modulation of the NAD+
concentration and SIRT1 are involved in
oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis

of cells to various stresses [18–20]. The preference
of tNOX for tumor cells over normal cells has been
confirmed by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function
approaches in cell culture systems [21, 22]. Intriguingly,
anticancer drugs were found to transiently up-regulate
tNOX expression, thereby enhancing migration and the
epithelia-mesenchymal transition (EMT) [15, 23]; this
may help explain the acquisition of drug resistance by
cells subjected to these anticancer treatments. Together,
these lines of evidence support the notion that tNOX is a
potential therapeutic target, as it appears to govern cellular
outcomes under a variety of stresses, from apoptosis to
tumorgenesis.
To explore whether tNOX is targeted by oxaliplatin,
we employed three lines of gastric cancer cells that differed
in their levels of tNOX expression and aggressiveness.
Our results suggest that oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis in
AGS cells occurs through tNOX-induced alterations in the
levels of NAD+/NADH and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) deacetylase,
and that these changes enhance p53 acetylation and
apoptosis.

Next, we explored whether tNOX could be involved in
the molecular mechanisms that govern oxaliplatin-mediated
growth inhibition and apoptosis. As tNOX catalyzes the
oxidation of reduced NADH to oxidized NAD+ [6, 7], we
questioned whether oxaliplatin affects the intracellular
levels of NAD+ and NADH. Indeed, we found that exposure
of AGS cells to oxaliplatin at doses of 1 μM and above
effectively decreased the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio
compared to that in control cells (Figure 2A), possibly due
to the inhibition of tNOX activity. The NAD+/NADH ratio
is an indicator of cellular redox balance, which affects many
cellular pathways. The availability of NAD+ also modulates
the activity of SIRT1, which acts as a deacetylase for both
histone and non-histone proteins (including the tumor
suppressor, p53) and affects many cellular responses [24].
We examined the effect of oxaliplatin on SIRT1 activity,
and found that the in vitro activity of recombinant SIRT1
was significantly inhibited by 20 μM oxaliplatin, making
its inhibitory power comparable to that of the well-defined
SIRT1 inhibitor, sirtinol (25 μM) (Figure 2B). Interestingly,
we observed an increase in p53 acetylation in cells treated
with as little as 1 μM of oxaliplatin (Figure 2C). The SIRT1
activity requires NAD+ as a cofactor and we speculate that
the tNOX-mediated decrease of NAD+ concentrations and
oxaliplatin-induced down-regulation of tNOX together
reduce SIRT1deacetylase activity in vivo, enhancing p53
acetylation and apoptosis. These results are consistent
with a previous report demonstrating that SIRT1-mediated
p53 deacetylation can negatively regulate stress-mediated
apoptosis [25].
We next used RNA interference (RNAi) to downregulate tNOX expression in AGS cells. RNA interference
targeting tNOX reduced expression of SIRT1 and this
SIRT1 suppression was accompanied by enhanced p53
acetylation (Figure 3A). As expected, the intracellular
NAD+/NADH ratio was decreased in these tNOXknockdown AGS cells (Figure 3B). More importantly,
apoptotic populations were significantly higher in tNOXknockdown AGS control cells and tNOX-depletion also
enhanced sensitivity of AGS cells to oxaliplatin-induced
apoptosis at 0.1 μM compared to the controls (Figure 3C).
On the other hand, overexpression of tNOX in AGS
cells has reversed the oxaliplatin-mediated apoptosis,
suggesting a pro-survival role of tNOX (Figure 3D).

RESULTS
Oxaliplatin downregulates tNOX protein
expression and induces apoptosis in AGS cells
We herein studied the effect of oxaliplatin on the
tNOX protein and assessed the underlying mechanism
in three cell lines derived from human stomach
cancers: AGS (gastric adenocarcinoma), MKN45
(from the lymph node of a moderately differentiated
stomach adenocarcinoma), and TMK-1 (from a poorly
differentiated adenocarcinoma). We founded that the
tNOX protein is expressed to varying degrees in all
three gastric cancer lines, with AGS (wild type p53),
which is the least aggressive line, showing a low level
of tNOX expression (Figure 1A). Moreover, tNOX
expression was not detected in non-cancer human lung
tissue MRC-5 or colon CCD-18Co cells (Figure 1A).
Oxaliplatin effectively reduced tNOX expression at both
the transcriptional and translational levels (Figure 1B).
Since stress-mediated tNOX downregulation is
associated with apoptosis [18, 20], we analyzed apoptotic
populations. Our results revealed that oxaliplatin induced
significant apoptosis at 1 μM (Figure 1C), and that
this was accompanied by downregulation of the antiapoptotic protein, Bcl-2, and up-regulation of the proapoptotic responses of Bax expression, p53 activation,
and caspase 3-directed PARP cleavage (Figure 1D). When
dynamic cell growth was continuously monitored by cell
impedance measurements, which are presented as cell
index (CI) values, we found that oxaliplatin decreased the
CI values in AGS cells, with the IC50 value calculated to
be 0.6 μM (Figure 1E).

MKN45 and TMK-1 cells are less responsive to
the apoptotic effect of oxaliplatin
We next examined the effect of oxaliplatin on the
more aggressive gastric cancer lines, MKN45 (wild type
p53) and TMK-1 (mutant p53). Interestingly, oxaliplatin
exhibited much less cytotoxicity toward these two lines,

with our cell impedance measurements yield IC50 values
of 18.2 and 97.8 μM, respectively (Figure 4A). Consistent
with this, minimal induction of apoptosis was observed
in treated cells, even among those exposed to 10 μM of
oxaliplatin regardless of their p53 status (Figure 4B).
Consistent with the tumor-promoting role of tNOX
suggested by many previous studies, oxaliplatin-treated
MKN45 and TMK-1 cells showed no down-regulation of
tNOX at both translational and transcriptional levels (in
fact, some up-regulation of tNOX was observed in TMK-1
cells), increased expression of survivin (an anti-apoptotic
factor), and no evidence of caspase 3-directed PARP
cleavage (Figure 4C). Unlike our finding in AGS cells,
the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio in TMK-1 cells was
increased by oxaliplatin (Figure 4D), possibly due to the
enhancement of tNOX. Also in contrast to our findings in
AGS cells, oxaliplatin caused a decrease in p53 acetylation
in both cell lines (Figure 4E). This suggests that, in these
aggressive cell lines, oxaliplatin increased the intracellular
NAD+/NADH ratio to enhance SIRT1 activity and p53
deacetylation, and thus, did not trigger apoptosis, at least
in functional p53-expressing MKN45 cells.

To further examine the role of SIRT1 in oxaliplatininduced apoptosis, we used RNAi to down-regulate SIRT1
expression in MKN45 and TMK-1 cells (Figure 5A). In
both cell lines, transfection of SIRT1-targeting smallinterfering RNA (siRNA) significantly enhanced the levels
of p53 acetylation (Figure 5A). Significantly enhanced
apoptosis was also observed in SIRT1-knockdown
MKN45 cells exposed to 10 μM oxaliplatin (Figure 5B).
Interestingly, oxaliplatin induced marked apoptosis in
SIRT1-depleted TMK-1 cells compared to the controls
regardless of the presence of mutant p53 (Figure 5C).
Consistent with the findings by Kim et al. [26], our results
support the idea that suppression of SIRT1 enhanced the
sensitivity of cells to stress-induced apoptosis.

RNAi-mediated tNOX downregulation enhances
spontaneous apoptosis and prolongs cell cycle
We further utilized RNAi to knock down tNOX in
TMK-1 cells, which were the most aggressive cells tested
herein (Figure 6A). Interestingly, tNOX-depleted cells
exhibited a higher level of spontaneous apoptosis than

control cells but not to the significant level (Figure 6B).
tNOX-knockdown cells exposed to 40 μM oxaliplatin indeed
showed considerably enhanced apoptosis compared to
scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (Figure 6B). These results
indicate that tNOX is important for cancer cell survival, and
downregulation of tNOX enhances the sensitivity of resistant
TMK-1 cells to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis.
Next, we knocked down tNOX expression in both
MKN45 and TMK-1 cells (Figure 7A), and examined
various phenotypes. In these tNOX-depleted cells,
the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio was significantly
attenuated compared to the scrambled siRNA-transfected
controls (Figure 7B). Moreover, SIRT1 expression
was attenuated, p53 acetylation was enhanced, and
the pro-survival factor, Bcl-2, was down-regulated, in

the knockdown cells (Figure 7C). These findings are
all consistent with the notion that SIRT1 and tNOX
possess tumor-promoting properties. Ultimately, tNOXknockdown also increased spontaneous apoptosis
(Figure 7D). Cell cycle analysis revealed a lack of cell
cycle arrest in knockdown cells (data not shown); instead,
staining with CMFDA (a tracking dye for cell division)
showed that tNOX knockdown increased the doubling
time and prolonged cell cycle progression (Figure 7E).
We also observed a decrease in the protein expression of
cyclin D, an essential cell cycle regulator (Figure 7C).
These data suggest that the tNOX protein acts as a
pro-tumor factor by controlling the intracellular redox
environment, which is important to the regulation of cell
apoptosis and proliferation.

DISCUSSION

had much smaller inhibitory effects and triggered little
apoptosis in MKN45 and TMK-1 cells, which are known
to be relatively resistant to this agent. However, the
depletion of either tNOX or SIRT1 sensitized TMK-1
cells to oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis, demonstrating their
importance in this pathway.
One significant finding of this study is that SIRT1
plays a regulatory role in oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis.
SIRT1, which is a well-studied member of the sirtuin
protein family, requires NAD+ as cofactor to catalyze the
deacetylation of histone and nonhistone proteins [27, 28].
SIRT1 is known to regulate a host of cellular events
(e.g., lifespan and metabolism) through its deacetylase
activity. However, its role in tumorgenesis is somewhat

In this study, we investigated the apoptotic effect
of oxaliplatin on three different lines of gastric cancer
cell lines (AGS, MKN45, and TMK-1 cells), focusing
on potential non-DNA molecular targets. We found that
the responsiveness of these cell lines toward oxaliplatin
was reflected in the ability of tNOX to induce changes
in the levels of NAD+ and SIRT1 deacetylase activity,
which appeared to play influential role in oxaliplatininduced apoptosis. In the oxaliplatin-sensitive AGS cell
line, oxaliplatin repressed the tNOX-induced NAD+
level and SIRT1 deacetylase activity, thereby enhancing
p53 acetylation and apoptosis. In contrast, oxaliplatin

controversial, as some reports have indicated that it acts
as a tumor promoter, while others have found it has
tumor suppressor function [29–31]. In the present study,
we provide additional evidence for the tumor-promoting
function of SIRT1 by showing that oxaliplatin inhibits the
growth of AGS cells via decreased SIRT1 activity, which
enhances p53 acetylation and apoptosis.
In its role as a regulator of many metabolic reactions,
NAD+ has been proposed to act through members of the
SIRT family [32]. In this regard, the intracellular NAD+/
NADH level and SIRT1 activity must be well maintained.
Here, we suggest that tNOX can contribute to regulating
the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio and SIRT1 activity.
We further suggest that the ability of oxaliplatin to induce
apoptosis relates to its ability to inhibit tNOX and decrease
the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio. Thus, apoptosis in
association with downregulation of tNOX and reduced
NAD+ level were observed in AGS gastric cancer cells,
whereas minimum apoptosis concurrent with a lack of
tNOX downregulation and increased in NAD+/NADH
ratio were noticed in MKN45 and TMK-1 metastatic
gastric carcinoma lines. The results of our RNAi
experiments in all three cell lines demonstrate that tNOX
knockdown attenuates the intracellular NAD+/NADH
ratio (Figure 3B and 7B), supporting the notion that tNOX

contributes to maintaining the cellular NAD+/NADH redox
status. These findings are consistent with those of Liang et
al., who demonstrated that inhibition of SIRT1-mediated
p53 deacetylation can suppress lung adenocarcinoma
cells in vitro and in vivo [33]. Here, we explored further
the mechanism underlying this regulation and show for
the first time that the tNOX-modulated NAD+/NADH
ratio-SIRT1-p53 axis contributes to oxaliplatin-induced
apoptosis and cell growth suppression in AGS cells
(Figures 1 and 2). However, our data from TMK-1 (p53
mutant) cells suggested that other downstream targets of
SIRT1 might be involved in oxaliplatin-induced apoptosis,
such as FOXO3 [34].
Oxaliplatin treatment is frequently associated with
drug resistance, but numerous studies have demonstrated
that the sensitivity of cells to oxaliplatin-induced
cytotoxicity (and thus the therapeutic performance of this
agent) can be improved by the knockdown of specific
proteins, including Nrf2 [35], FOXM1/Mcl-1 [36], and
Oc4, which acts through STAT3/survivin pathway [37].
There appears to be a positive relationship between tNOX
expression and cancer phenotypes, including increased cell
proliferation, migration and EMT [7, 15, 18, 22, 23, 38].
In this study, we show that oxaliplatin triggers apoptosis
by down-regulating tNOX at both the translational and

transcriptional levels in AGS cells (Figure 1). Oxaliplatin
exhibits much less cytotoxicity against the more
aggressive and oxaliplatin-resistant gastric cancer lines,
MKN45 and TMK-1, but depletion of tNOX in these
cells increased their susceptibility to the drug (Figures 4
and 6). The different effects of oxaliplatin appear to reflect
its ability to inhibit tNOX expression in the three tested
cell lines. Interestingly, tNOX depletion attenuated SIRT1
expression in all three cell lines (Figure 3A and 7C). As
the knockdown of tNOX activates p53 (Figure 7C), we
speculate that this effect on SIRT1 might reflect the ability
of p53 to act as a transcription factor for microRNA-34a,
which negatively regulates the SIRT1 protein [39–41].
Taken together, our results show that oxaliplatin
mediates diverse inhibitory effects on the growth of gastric
cancer cells, and demonstrate that tNOX knockdown
sensitizes resistant gastric cancer cells to oxaliplatininduced apoptosis. Furthermore, we provide evidence
suggesting that the tNOX-induced modulation of the
NAD+-SIRT1 axis is important to oxaliplatin-induced
apoptosis. These findings show that tNOX plays an
essential function in growth regulation and survival of
gastric cancer cells, and may provide a rational framework
for the further development of tNOX inhibitors as a novel
class of antitumor agents.

were treated with different concentrations of oxaliplatin
dissolved in ddH2O, and the controls were treated with the
same volume of ddH2O.
ON-TARGETplus tNOX (ENOX2) siRNA and
negative control siRNA were purchased from Thermo
Scientific, Inc. (Grand Island, NY) and SignalSilence Sirt1
siRNA I and control siRNA were from Cell Signaling
Technology, Inc. (Beverly, MA, USA). Briefly, cells were
seeded in 10-cm dishes, allowed to attach overnight, and
then transfected with tNOX/Sirt1 siRNA and control
siRNA using Lipofectamin RNAiMAX Reagent (Life
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were also transiently
transfected with tNOX-GST or GST (control) using the
jetPEI transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s
protocol (Polyplus-transfection SA, Illkirch Cedex, France).

Continuous monitoring of cell impedance
For continuous monitoring of changes in cell
growth, cells (7.5 × 103 cells/well) were seeded onto
E-plates and incubated for 30 min at room temperature.
The E-plates were placed onto a Real-Time Cell Analysis
(RTCA) station (Roche, Germany) and the cells were
grown overnight before being exposed to oxaliplatin or
ddH2O. Cell impedance was measured every hour for a
total of 70 hours, as previously described [42], and defined
by the cell index (CI) = (Zi − Z0) [Ohm]/15[Ohm], where
Z0 is background resistance and Zi is the resistance at
an individual time point. A normalized cell index was
determined as the cell index at a certain time point (CIti)
divided by the cell index at the normalization time point
(CInml_time).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials
Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/
streptomycin were obtained from Gibco/BRL Life
Technologies (Grand Island, NY, USA). The anti-Bak,
anti-PARP, anti-Bcl-2, anti-p53, anti-phospho-p53, antiacetyl-p53, anti-SIRT1, and anti-cyclin D1 antibodies were
purchased from Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. (Beverly,
MA, USA). The anti-b-actin antibody was from Millipore
Corp. (Temecula, CA, USA). The antisera to tNOX used
in Western blot analyses were generated as described
previously [22]. The 3,3′-Dihexyloxacarbocyanine
iodide [DiOC6(3)] was purchased from Calbiochem (San
Diego, CA, USA). The anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG
antibodies and other chemicals were purchased from the
Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO, USA), unless
specified otherwise.

Apoptosis determination
Apoptosis was measured using an Annexin V-FITC
apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen, San Jose, CA,
USA). Cells cultured in 6-cm dishes were trypsinized,
collected by centrifugation, washed, resuspended in 1×
binding buffer, and stained with annexin V-FITC, as
recommended by the manufacturer. Cells were also stained
with propidium iodide (PI) to detect necrosis or late
apoptosis. The distributions of viable (FITC/PI doublenegative), early apoptotic (FITC-positive), late apoptotic
(FITC/PI double-positive), and necrotic (PI-positive/
FITC-negative) cells were analyzed using a Beckman
Coulter FC500 flow cytometer. The results are expressed
as a percentage of total cells.

45 minutes. After treatment, the cells were washed with
PBS and trypsinized, and cell division was assessed by
flow cytometry as previously described [43].

Measurement of intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio
The oxidized and reduced forms of intracellular
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide were determined
using an NADH/NAD Quantification Kit (BioVision Inc.
Milpitas, CA) as described by the manufacturer. Briefly,
2 × 105 cells were washed with cold PBS, pelleted,
and extracted by two freeze/thaw cycles with 400 µl of
NADH/NAD+ extraction buffer. Samples were vortexed
and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. The extracted
NADH/NAD+ supernatant (200 µl) was transferred to
a microcentrifuge tube, heated to 60°C for 30 min (to
decompose NAD+ but not NADH), and then placed on
ice. The samples were then centrifuged and transferred
to a multiwall-plate. Standards and a NAD+ cycling mix
were prepared according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The reaction mix (100 µl) was distributed to each well
containing NADH standards and samples, and the plates
were incubated at room temperature for 5 minutes to
convert NAD+ to NADH. The provided NADH developer
solution was added to each well, and plates were incubated
at room temperature for 15 or 30 minutes. The reaction
was stopped with 10 µl of stop solution per well, and
absorbance was measured at 450 nm.

Western blot analysis
Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer
containing 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl,
5 mM EDTA, 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
(PMSF), 10 ng/ml leupeptin, and 10 µg/ml aprotinin).
Equal amounts of extracted proteins (40 µg) were
resolved SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose
membranes (Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH, USA). The
membranes were blocked with nonfat milk solution for an
hour, and then washed and probed with the appropriate
primary antibody. The membranes were rinsed with Trisbuffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20, incubated
with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary
antibody for 1 hour, rinsed again, and developed using
enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA).

Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
(RT-PCR)

Measurement of SIRT1 deacetylase activity in vitro
SIRT1 deacetylase activity was determined using a
SIRT1 direct Fluorescent Screening Assay Kit according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (Cayman Chemical Company,
Ann Arbor, MI). Briefly, the substrate solution was
prepared by adding 240 µl of NAD+ solution and 850 µl
of diluted assay buffer to 15 µl of the p53 peptide ArgHis-Lys-Lys(εacetyl)-AMC, to yield a final concentration
of 125 mM peptide (substrate) and 3 mM of NAD+. The
background was determined in wells containing 30 µl
of assay buffer and 5 µl of solvent. The maximal initial
activity (defined as 100%) was determined in wells
containing 5 µl of diluted human recombinant SIRT1,
25 µl of assay buffer, and 5 µl of solvent. To measure
oxaliplatin-induced changes in SIRT1 activity, 5 µl of
oxaliplatin was added to wells containing 25 µl of assay
buffer and 5 µl of diluted human recombinant SIRT1.
Reactions were initiated by adding 15 µl of substrate
solution to each well. The plate was then covered and
incubated on a shaker for 45 min at room temperature.
The reactions were stopped by adding 50 µl of stop/
developing solution to each well and incubating the plate
for 30 minutes at room temperature. Plates were read in a
fluorimeter using excitation wavelengths of 350–360 nm
and emission wavelengths of 450–465 nm.

Total RNA from gastric cancer cells was isolated using
the TRIzol reagent (GIBCO, Carlsbad, CA, USA). First
strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using
Superscript II (Life Technologies, Rockville, MD, USA). The
following primers sets were used for PCR amplifications:
tNOX, 5′-GAAGTGTGATGCCGATAACAG -3′′ (sense)
and 5′-AGTACTAGAGCCCAGGCGAA-3′ (antisense); and
b-actin, 5′-ACTCACCTTGGTGGTGCATA-3′ (sense)
and 5′-ACACCTTGATGGGAAAGGTGG-3′ (antisense).
The reaction conditions consisted of 30 cycles of 95°C for
30 seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute,
followed by a final extension of 5 minutes at 72°C. The
obtained PCR produces were resolved by 1.4% agarose gels
electrophoresis and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.

Statistics
All data are expressed as the means ± SEs of three or
more independent experiments. Between-group comparisons
were performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) followed by an appropriate post-hoc test. A value
of p < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
