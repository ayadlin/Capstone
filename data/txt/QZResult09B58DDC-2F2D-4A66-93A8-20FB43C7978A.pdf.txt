We acknowledge the concerns by Louie et al regarding the high local recurrence rates after RFA compared
with those reported after SBRT. However, it is important
to emphasize that local disease recurrence in the Z4033
study included recurrence in the primary tumor lobe,
both away from and at the RFA site, as well as hilar lymph
node recurrence. In the majority of reports regarding
SBRT, local recurrence refers to disease recurrence within
or close to the planning treatment volume only. Another
consideration is how local recurrence is determined. In
the Z4033 study, recurrence was determined using computed tomography densitometry and PET scan, as well as
the liberal use of biopsy. This is in contrast to several
SBRT studies in which PET was rarely used; densitometry
was never used in follow-up; and biopsy proof of malignancy before the initiation of therapy was missing,
let alone used in the follow-up assessment in several oftenquoted series of SBRT. Unless there is uniformity with
regard to how disease recurrence is defined and measured,
the cleanest endpoint with which to compare such studies
is overall survival. As discussed by Crabtree et al,3 survival
after RFA in the Z4033 study was similar to survival in
what to our knowledge is the only multicenter, National
Cancer Institute prospective study from North America
that examined medically inoperable patients.
In summary, we would still argue that RFA is a reasonable option, particularly among medically inoperable
patients with non-small cell lung cancer with small, stage I
tumors.

Beta-Blockers and Improved
Survival From Ovarian Cancer:
New Miracle Treatment or
Another Case of Immortal
Person-Time Bias?
In a recent study, Watkins et al1 examined the association
between the use of beta-blockers and mortality among
1425 women with epithelial ovarian cancer who were
treated with at least 1 cycle of platinum-based doublet
chemotherapy. The hazard ratio of death after a diagnosis
of ovarian cancer was 0.26 (95% confidence interval
[95% CI], 0.19-0.37) for the use of any beta-blockers,
0.32 (95% CI, 0.22-0.45) for the use of selective betablockers, and 0.08 (95% CI, 0.03-0.22) for the use of
nonselective beta-blockers.1 In comparison, a metaanalysis of clinical trials found that the treatment of
patients with advanced ovarian cancer using platinum
compounds was associated with a hazard ratio of 0.88
(95% CI, 0.79-0.98) compared with control treatment.2
Thus, do beta-blockers represent a new miracle
treatment with effects going far beyond those of current
first-line chemotherapy, or are the results biased?
Immortal person-time bias arises when the definition of an exposure or covariate relies on an event (eg,
treatment initiation) that occurs after the start of followup.3,4 Such definitions are problematic because individuals have to survive between the start of follow-up and the

defining event to be classified as exposed. Inclusion of this
time, which is typically referred to as “immortal,” will
overestimate survival for the exposed group.
In the study by Watkins et al,1 women were followed
from the time of their ovarian cancer diagnosis until death.
The exposure-defining event was the use of beta-blockers
during neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy.1 The
authors included the (immortal) time elapsed between the
ovarian cancer diagnosis and the initiation of beta-blocker
therapy in the exposed group,1 thereby biasing the estimates
in favor of beta-blocker use. To illustrate the problem,
imagine a woman was treated successfully with 6 cycles of
chemotherapy, after which her physician decided to initiate
therapy with beta-blockers. This woman would have contributed person-time to the beta-blocker group from the diagnosis date, although her survival from the time of
diagnosis to the end of chemotherapy could not possibly
have been an effect of the beta-blocker use. In contrast,
imagine a nonresponder to chemotherapy who died after
receiving her first cycle of therapy. Due to her early death,
this woman never became eligible for beta-blocker therapy.
Therefore, she would only have contributed person-time in
the nonuser group. These hypothetical examples demonstrate that, by design, women with high mortality are overrepresented among nonusers, whereas women with low
mortality are overrepresented among beta-blocker users.
The correct method with which to handle persontime would have been to include only the time passed after
beta-blocker initiation in the calculation of person-time
for the exposed cohort.3,4 Different approaches are available (eg, conditional landmark analysis, the extended Cox
model with time-varying covariates, and the inverse
probability-weighted model).4
To our knowledge, 4 other studies to date have
examined the association between beta-blockers and
survival in patients with ovarian cancer.5-8 Two of these
studies reported improved survival among users of betablockers, but both were likely biased by the inclusion of
immortal person-time.5,6 In contrast, the other 2 studies
were designed to avoid this specific bias and found no evidence of a survival benefit with the use of beta-blockers.7,8
We authored 1 of the latter 2 studies, in which we emphasized the problem of immortal person-time bias in the
existing literature.7 Although Watkins et al1 referenced
this previous work of ours,7 they still included immortal
person-time in their analysis.

We reviewed the correspondence by Venniyoor and
Schmidt and Schmidt regarding our recent article.1,2 We
appreciate their comments and will clarify some of the
points.
Schmidt and Schmidt cite the 1998 meta-analyses of
37 randomized trials to illustrate the potential for bias in
our study.2 However, we believe this article has several limitations to its use as a comparator to our study, including
the use of platinum with a multitude of second-line, nontaxane chemotherapy agents; cross-study comparison bias;
