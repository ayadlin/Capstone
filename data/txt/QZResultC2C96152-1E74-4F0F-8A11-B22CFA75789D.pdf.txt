BACKGROUND. Because of scarce data from larger series and nonhomogeneous
selection criteria, further information is needed on peritonectomy with
hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) in managing patients with
ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis.

METHODS. In an open, prospective, single-center nonrandomized phase 2 study
conducted from November 2000 to April 2007, 47 patients with primary advanced
or recurrent ovarian cancer and diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis were enrolled;
22 underwent primary and 25 secondary cytoreduction plus immediate HIPEC
followed by systemic chemotherapy.

RESULTS. The overall mean Sugarbaker peritoneal cancer index was 14.9 (range,
6–28). A mean of 6 surgical procedures were required per patient (range, 4–10).
In 87.3% of the patients debulking achieved optimal cytoreduction (Sugarbaker

scopic residual disease (CC-2 or CC-3). Major complications developed in 21.3%
of the patients and the in-hospital mortality rate was 4.2%. The mean overall sursurvival was 27.4 months. Five-year survival was 16.7%. Univariate (log-rank test
and analysis of variance) and multivariate analyses (Cox proportional-hazard
model) identified the CC score as the main factor capable of independently influencing survival.

CONCLUSIONS. Peritonectomy procedures combined with HIPEC offer promising
long-term survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis. They
achieve high adequate primary and secondary surgical cytoreduction rates with
acceptable morbidity and mortality. Cancer 2008;113:315–25.  2008 American

eritoneal carcinomatosis is a typical feature of cancer spread in
patients with primary advanced or recurrent epithelial ovarian
cancers. Ascites and locoregional lymph node involvement are frequently associated with peritoneal carcinomatosis, whereas distant
metastases appear later.
Although ovarian cancer is 1 of the most chemotherapy-sensitive solid tumors and 1 of the few in which the 5-year survival rate
has improved in recent years,1 in most women with locally
advanced disease long-term survival remains poor.2 Standard therapy for advanced ovarian cancer consists of 2 steps: cytoreductive

surgery followed by adjuvant platinum and taxane
chemotherapy. Although this combined therapy initially seems effective, insofar as high rates of patients
achieve a good response,3 about half of the patients
relapse within 5 years and disease-free survival rarely
exceeds 18 months.4,5
Since the first report of Griffith in 1975,6 multiple
retrospective series have shown that survival time is
inversely proportional to residual tumor size,7,8 and a
recent meta-analysis confirms that 1 of the most
powerful determinants of cohort survival among
patients in stage III or IV ovarian cancer is maximal
cytoreduction.9 Although maximal tumor debulking
has now achieved consensus for women with
advanced ovarian cancer,10–12 important questions
remain about the complex strategy for treating diffuse ovarian peritoneal carcinomatosis, a condition
characterized by severe macroscopic disease involving the upper and lower abdominal quadrants.12,13
In other nonovarian carcinomatoses, including
cancer of the appendix and colon, maximum cytoreduction, namely, peritonectomy according to the
Sugarbaker criteria,14 combined with hyperthermic
intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), is a promising locoregional treatment that offers acceptable
morbidity and mortality rates and the possibility of
long survival.15,16 Although peritonectomy procedures with HIPEC found favor later in ovarian carcinomatosis than in other carcinomatoses, in recent
years this therapeutic strategy has attracted growing
interest.17–24 The discrepant results from the various
case series nevertheless leave several questions
unclear, most important, the selection of patients
according to the disease setting (primary or secondary cytoreduction) and extent of carcinomatosis, criteria for classifying intraperitoneal disease spread,
and surgical techniques.
In this study, we reviewed our prospective experience in a consecutive series of patients with primary advanced or recurrent ovarian cancer and
diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis who underwent
extensive tumor debulking surgery aimed at maximal
surgical cytoreduction with peritonectomy procedures and HIPEC. We focused our attention on
patient selection criteria, surgical techniques, and
immediate and long-term results.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study was an open, prospective, single-center
nonrandomized phase 2 study conducted at the
Department of Surgery, Pietro Valdoni, University La
Sapienza of Rome, Italy, between November 2000
and April 2007. Patients with primary advanced or

recurrent ovarian cancer (TNM-FIGO stages IIIc-IV)
and evidence of peritoneal diffuse carcinomatosis
were considered eligible. The inclusion criteria were
age younger than 75 years; a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis; performance status 0–2
(WHO)25; adequate cardiac, renal, hepatic, and bone
marrow function; resectable disease; and informed
written consent. The exclusion criteria were extraabdominal metastases; other malignancies except
breast cancer; unresectable disease; and active infections or severe associated medical conditions.
The treatment plan envisaged extensive surgical
cytoreduction aimed at removing all visible disease
plus immediate HIPEC and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy according to the patient’s general status.
The study protocol was approved by the Hospital
Medical Ethical Committee.

Surgical Procedure (Peritonectomy)
At laparotomy the extent of peritoneal carcinomatosis was recorded according to the peritoneal cancer
index (PCI).26 Aggressive surgical cytoreduction was
then undertaken to leave the patient with no visible
disease. One or more peritonectomy procedures14
were required, depending on the distribution and
volume of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Small numbers
of scattered peritoneal implants were resected or
ablated with high-voltage electrocautery, radiofrequency technology (TissueLink BPS 6.0, Dover, NH),
or an argon beam coagulator. Bulky disease such as
confluent implants involving an extensive area were
usually removed with 1 of the major peritonectomy
procedures.
The completeness of cytoreduction (CC) was
scored as proposed by Sugarbaker: CC0: no residual
disease; CC1: residual nodules measuring less than
2.5 mm; CC2: residual nodules measuring between
2.5 mm and 2.5 cm; and CC3: residual nodules
greater than 2.5 cm.27
HIPEC
At the end of each surgical procedure, HIPEC was
given with the closed technique. Four drains were
positioned for HIPEC inflow/outflow and temperature monitoring. The inflow/outflow drains were connected to a closed extracorporeal sterile circuit in
which a 4 to 6 L perfusate was circulated by means
of a peristaltic pump at a flow rate of 500 mL/min.
The closed sterile circuit was heated by means of a
thermal exchanger connected to the heating circuit
(EXIPER, Euromedical, Italy).
HIPEC at temperatures ranging from 42–438C
was given for 60 minutes with cisplatin at a dose of
75 mg/m2. Trendelenburg/anti-Trendelenburg and

laterolateral inclinations of the recumbent patient
were changed every 5 minutes to guarantee that the
entire endoabdominal surface was perfused. After
the procedure the abdomen was washed with 3–4 L
of sterile saline solution at 378C.

Morbidity and Toxicity
During the immediate postoperative period patients
were assisted in an intensive care unit (ICU) for at
least 24 hours. Cisplatin toxicity was scored using the
WHO toxicity grading scale for chemotherapy.25
Treatment-related morbidity and mortality were classified as grade 1: no complication; grade 2: minor
complications; grade 3: major complications requiring reoperation, ICU admission, or interventional
radiology; and grade 4: in-hospital mortality.28
Follow-up
After hospital discharge, patients were referred to the
medical oncologic staff to plan systemic chemotherapy. Patients were followed up every 6 months with
abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, measurement
of serum markers (Ca 125 and Ca 199), and any further evaluation indicated by the patients’ clinical presentation.
Survival and Statistical Analysis
Differences between groups of observations were analyzed by a chi-square test. The Kaplan-Meier
method was used to construct survival curves and a
log-rank test was used to assess the significance of
the differences between curves. Survival was also
expressed as mean and median. Analysis of variance
(ANOVA) was used to assess the statistical significance of differences in mean survival between
groups. The Cox regression model was used to determine the prognostic value of independent variables.
P-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. The NCSS (Kaysville, Utah) package was used
to analyze the database and perform statistical tests.

RESULTS
Patients
Forty-seven patients with a median age of 60.3 years
(range, 32–75) with primary advanced or recurrent
ovarian cancer and evidence of diffuse peritoneal
carcinomatosis were prospectively enrolled in the
study from November 2000 to April 2007. Four more
patients initially enrolled underwent a palliative procedure alone and are not considered in this report.
Of the 47 patients enrolled, 22 (46.8%) underwent primary cytoreduction; 4 of them received

neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and paclitaxel and 2 had previously undergone ileostomy for
intestinal occlusion elsewhere. The other 25 patients
underwent secondary cytoreduction at 4 to 312
months after the last operation (mean, 52.4 months;
median, 26 months): 18 patients for recurrent
disease, 4 patients as interval debulking, and 3 as
second-look surgery.
All 25 patients undergoing secondary cytoreduction had already undergone 1 or more operations for
ovarian cancer (range, 1–4 laparotomies) plus chemotherapy (range, 1–3 lines). Two patients had undergone 6 laparotomies either for ovarian cancer or for
other abdominal nonneoplastic diseases. Patient
characteristics are summarized in Table 1.

Surgical Procedure
The mean PCI calculated according to Sugarbaker
criteria was 14.9 (range, 6–28) for the study sample
overall, without differences between primary or secondary cytoreduction. The 47 patients treated
required a total 305 surgical procedures, mean 6.4
per patient (range, 4–10) (Table 2).
In patients managed by en bloc rectal resection
with hysterectomy-adnexectomy or removal of the
recurrent pelvic mass, intestinal continuity was
restored later, after the end of adjuvant chemotherapy and an adequate follow-up.

All patients who underwent primary cytoreduction also had systematic pelvic and paraaortic
lymphadenectomy. Of the 25 patients who underwent secondary cytoreduction only 8 underwent
these procedures. In 15 patients from the 2 groups
lymphadenectomy included other sites, especially for
enlarged mesenteric, splenic hilus, and splenic and
hepatic artery lymph nodes.
In 41 of the 47 patients debulking achieved optimal cytoreduction (scored CC-0 or CC-1), whereas in
6 patients (12.8%) it left macroscopic residual disease
(scored CC-2 or CC-3). In all patients who had a low
PCI (less than or equal to 15) debulking achieved
complete cytoreduction, whereas in patients with
PCI >15 debulking achieved optimal cytoreduction
in 76% (P 5 .0006, chi-square test). Primary and secondary cytoreduction procedures yielded similar CC
scores (Table 3).
The mean overall duration of the operative procedure was 528 minutes (range, 180-780) including
HIPEC. Primary cytoreduction took longer than secondary cytoreduction (600 minutes vs 465). The
mean blood loss was 1494 mL (range, 100–4900); a
mean 3.4 blood units and 5.2 plasma units were
transfused. The mean ICU stay was 40.1 hours

(range, 12–96) and the mean hospital stay 22.1 days,
and differed slightly for primary and secondary
cytoreduction (Table 4).

HIPEC
Of the total 47 patients in the series, 45 underwent
HIPEC at the end of surgery. Two patients did not
undergo HIPEC owing to their unstable postoperative
hemodynamic conditions and underwent a 5-day
course of postoperative intraperitoneal unheated
chemotherapy after ICU discharge. The mean time to
reach a temperature higher than 408C in the abdominal cavity was 10 minutes and the intraperitoneal
temperature invariably remained over 418C and
mainly over 428C (mean, 42.78C, range, 41.0–43.38C).
None of the HIPEC procedures led to the development of thermal intolerance. The only adverse event
related to HIPEC was cisplatin toxicity (2 cases). The
major cisplatin-related renal toxicity was grade 1
(WHO) in 1 patient and grade 2 in the other; medical
treatment reversed both drug-induced reactions.
Morbidity and Mortality
Of the 47 patients treated, 24 (51.1%) had no complications, 10 (21.3%) had minor complications (grade
2) mainly accounted for by pleural effusion and
wound infection, and 10 patients (21.3%) had grade
3 complications: in 6 patients requiring reoperation,
in 3 an interventional radiologic procedure, and in 1
patient ICU readmission. Two patients died of pulmonary embolisms during the postoperative course,
accounting for an in-hospital mortality of 4.2%
(Table 4).
Histologic Features
In most of the 47 patients treated (66%) histologic
analysis of the resected specimen disclosed serous
adenocarcinomas; 19.1% had mucinous carcinomas,
and the remaining 14.9% had endometrioid carcinomas. In many patients (61.7%) lymph nodes removed
during lymphadenectomy and cytoreduction were
free of metastases. Of the 47 patients, 18 (38.3%) had
lymph-node metastases; 8.6% had metastases in
locoregional nodes, 17% in nonlocoregional stations
alone, and 12.7% in both locoregional and extraregional stations according to TNM and FIGO staging29
(Table 5).
Follow-up and Survival
Assessment at discharge showed that most patients
(95.6%) had a satisfactory performance status (equal
to or less than 2). In only 2 cases did the patient’s
poor general condition contraindicate the postopera-

No patient was lost to follow-up. Of the 45
patients who survived after the surgical procedure,
23 (51.1%) are alive and disease-free, 3 (6.7%) are
alive with disease, 16 (35.5%) died of disease-related
causes, and 3 patients (6.7%) died of causes unrelated to cancer.
The mean overall survival was 30.4 months
(standard deviation [SD] 22.1 months; range, 6–83);
median survival was 24 months. Mean disease-free
survival was 27.4 months (SD 23.2, range, 0–8);

aimed at maximal surgical cytoreduction (peritonectomy procedures) plus HIPEC suggest that this
procedure is a reasonable evidence-based therapeutic approach. Our study underlines that according to
the disease setting, peritonectomy plus HIPEC seems
equally warranted for primary and secondary cytoreduction. Until now this combined procedure was
reserved mainly for patients undergoing secondary
cytoreduction because it was merely considered as
salvage treatment in patients with recurrent or chemotherapy-resistant ovarian cancer. Nevertheless, in

agreement with others,24,30 considering the high recurrence rates after standard treatment for advanced
ovarian cancer, and the good results the combined
procedures achieved in our series and in others, we
suggest that maximal cytoreduction (peritonectomy
procedures) plus HIPEC should now be the up-front
treatment for selected patients with ovarian carcino-

matosis who have diffuse peritoneal spread. When
we analyzed the main patient selection criteria—age,
performance status, comorbidity, and extent of
disease—we found that, as others have underlined,
patients aged older than 75 years with severely compromised performance status or severe comorbidity
are generally unsuitable to undergo peritonectomy
plus HIPEC.18,21,23 Diagnostic techniques are still
lacking that will reliably select patients with extensive peritoneal carcinomatosis suitable for surgery.
The previously reported criteria for patient selection
include clinical and radiographic characteristics
ranging from a general description of unresectable
disease to specific disease locations or clinical conditions and genetic profile.31,32 In this series, unlike
others, to assess the extent of disease and predict
the surgical outcome we never used diagnostic
laparoscopy33 because we consider it of no help in
selecting patients to undergo peritonectomy plus
HIPEC and may even bias the decision in favor of

inappropriate nonexploration, thus reserving operation for the less problematic cases. Although most of
our patients had extensive ovarian carcinomatosis
(mean PCI 14.9), in 87.2% of the patients aggressive
debulking surgery achieved satisfactory cytoreduction (CC-0/CC-1) with a rate of complete cytoreduction (CC0) of 59.6%. The degree of cytoreduction we
obtained ranks high among that from published series in patients with advanced or recurrent ovarian
cancer treated with standard techniques or with peritonectomy plus HIPEC.12,13,17–24,34–36 Our experience
in ovarian carcinomatosis suggests that although a
PCI lower than 15 is a determinant factor in obtaining optimal cytoreduction, a PCI higher than 15 does
not invariably preclude satisfactory surgical results
(Table 3). Our opinion therefore goes against those
who recommend a strict threshold value, considering
that, as Eisenkop et al.34 observed in ovarian cancer,
prognosis seems to be influenced less by initial tumor volume and more by the extent of cytoreduction
achieved. Our experience in this series adds useful
personal technical considerations specific to ovarian
carcinomatosis. During pelvic peritonectomy according to Sugarbaker,14 which combines en bloc removal
of the female reproductive organs, pouch of Douglas,
and rectum, we always extended parietal peritonectomy to the transverse umbilical line. For several reasons we rarely restored intestinal continuity with the
rectal stump immediately, during peritonectomy procedures and HIPEC. First, because most of our
patients presented with intestinal subocclusion that
precluded proper preoperative large bowel preparation, we had to limit the development of complications in patients who had undergone especially
aggressive interventions often entailing numerous
anastomoses and in whom the protocol envisaged
HIPEC. Besides, because the pelvis is the main site
of malignant recurrence we preferred to opt for a terminal colostomy in the iliac fossa and postpone
restoring intestinal continuity for a second look. In
most patients we waited for at least 6 months after
postperitonectomy systemic chemotherapy before
restoring intestinal continuity. In 15 patients in our
series extensive large bowel carcinomatosis necessitated a total colectomy.
An especially important technical point concerns
the best strategy for treating the small bowel: the
number of resections and the extension of resection
need careful thought to limit functional damage and
allow adequate debulking. Ileal tracts less severely
involved by the malignancy are more amenable to in
situ treatment by means of argon beam laser, electrovaporization, or radiofrequency technology (TissueLink, BPS 6.0; Salient Surgical Technologies,

Dover, NH). In most patients in this series, extensive
tumor spread necessitated upper abdominal procedures to obtain optimal debulking and in all cases
envisaged complete greater omentectomy, and never
infracolic omentectomy alone. In all the patients
whom we operated on for recurrence and who had
undergone surgery elsewhere, laparotomy disclosed
carcinomatosis in the residual omentum. Precisely
when debulking surgery should include removal of
the spleen remains unclear.37 In our experience,
apart from patients with evident direct tumor involvement of the spleen, we undertook splenectomy
whenever macroscopic malignant implants involved
the gastrosplenic ligament. In these cases possible
lymph-node metastases should be sought also in the
splenic hilum (11.1% in our case series).
According to others, the presence of liver metastases seems not per se sufficient to contraindicate
cytoreduction.38 In our experience in a patient who
underwent secondary cytoreduction a liver resection
(left hepatic lobectomy) provided an excellent outcome. The patient is alive and has been disease-free
for 83 months.
In this series we routinely removed pelvic and
paraaortic lymph nodes in all patients who underwent primary cytoreduction and in many patients
who had secondary cytoreduction. An analysis of the
site of nodal metastases nonetheless shows how diffuse peritoneal spread of ovarian malignancies favors
extensive lymph node diffusion spreading well
beyond the regional drainage to involve extraregional
nodes. Most patients who had lymph node metastases (77.8%) had them in extraregional sites with or
without associated regional nodes.
Considering the numerous surgical procedures
for each patient (6.4 per patient) and the lengthy
duration of peritonectomy procedures plus HIPEC
(mean, 528 minutes) the number of major complications and operative mortality rate is reasonably low
and comes within the range reported by other similar
case series17–24 (Table 8). The most frequent major
complications (grade 3) were intestinal fistulas owing
to the large number of multiple intestinal resections
required, bowel-wall weakening during maneuvers to
destroy malignant implants in situ, and in our series
the increased risk of applying closed HIPEC after
completing surgery and therefore after anastomoses
had been constructed.
Two patients died during the postoperative
course, 1 on Day 2 and the other on Day 5, both of
massive pulmonary embolisms. The risk of this complication developing is high even despite routine preventive treatment. Hence, to reduce mortality from
pulmonary embolism and prevent these complica-

tions in future we intend to use temporary inferior
vena cava filters especially for patients undergoing
more aggressive surgical debulking or longer procedures. Most of our patients had a long postoperative
course (about 20 days) and the duration correlated
with the extent of surgical resection. Conversely, the
relatively short mean ICU stay provided evidence
that strict patient selection and proper surgical and
anesthesiology techniques can keep the proceduralrelated risks within acceptable limits. Here we underline the importance of having an experienced operating team. All the interventions in our series were
done by the same surgeon (A.D.) with the same
surgical and anesthesiology team.
When we analyzed our long-term results, the
survival analysis showed that the overall 5-year survival was 16.7%, similar to that of most investigators
who reported treating patients with widespread peritoneal carcinomatosis (IIIc) and used cytoreduction
surgery plus HIPEC. The mean survival in our series
also matches the rate in published series reporting a

mean survival ranging from 28.1 to 45.8 months
(Table 8). The major discrepancies between our
prognostic results and those of others arise from differences in the length of follow-up and in initial
selection of patients, particularly the extent of the
endoperitoneal disease (PCI). Our patients’ PCI
values were among the highest reported in the literature, with a mean of 15, ranging from 6 to 28. Those
who reported considerably higher survival values
than we did included in their series patients staged
lower than IIIc FIGO21 or made no mention of how
carcinomatosis was classified.22
The prognostic indicators tested in our univariate analysis that correlated significantly with survival
were the degree of cytoreduction and the patient’s
age. Cox regression analysis, including along with the
CC score and patient’s age other prognostic factors
such as lymph node status, PCI, and primary or secondary surgical cytoreduction, identified as the most
significant factor in line with other series the
completeness of cytoreduction.9,39 Unlike others a

324

prognostic factor that weakens significance in our
multivariate analysis is age.39 Another factor that
seems to weigh less heavily on prognosis is the disease setting. Patients who underwent secondary
cytoreduction for recurrent disease fared as well as
those who underwent primary cytoreduction because
we achieved a similar degree of cytoreduction in the
2 groups. Accordingly, as the univariate and multivariate analyses showed, the CC score, the most significant outcome variable, was equally distributed in the
2 groups (Table 3).

Conclusions
In conclusion, peritonectomy procedures combined
with HIPEC provide a promising approach for longterm survival in patients with diffuse peritoneal ovarian carcinomatosis. The combined procedure
appears effective both for primary and secondary
surgical cytoreduction. The rate of adequate cytoreduction is high. Morbidity and mortality rates are
acceptable. The role of neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy in primary cytoreduction remains to be
investigated in prospective trials.
