BACKGROUND: Lenvatinib is an oral, multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1
through 3 (VEGFR1-VEGFR3), fibroblast growth factor receptors 1 through 4 (FGFR1-FGFR4), platelet-derived growth factor receptor
a (PDGFRa), ret proto-oncogene (RET), and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KIT) signaling networks implicated in tumor angiogenesis. Positive phase 1 results in solid tumors prompted a phase 2 trial in patients with advanced,
radioiodine-refractory, differentiated thyroid cancer (RR-DTC). METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with RR-DTC who had disease progression during the previous 12 months received lenvatinib 24 mg once daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression, unmanageable
toxicity, withdrawal, or death. Previous VEGFR-targeted therapy was permitted. The primary endpoint was the objective response
rate (ORR) based on independent imaging review. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Serum
levels of 51 circulating cytokines and angiogenic factors also were assessed. RESULTS: After 14 months of follow-up, patients had an
ORR of 50% (95% confidence interval [CI], 37%-63%) with only partial responses reported. The median time to response was 3.6
months, the median response duration was 12.7 months, and the median PFS was 12.6 months (95% CI, 9.9-16.1 months). The ORR for
patients who had received previous VEGF therapy (n 5 17) was 59% (95% CI, 33%-82%). Lower baseline levels of angiopoietin-2 were
suggestive of tumor response and longer PFS. Grade 3 and 4 treatment-emergent adverse events, regardless of their relation to
treatment, occurred in 72% of patients and most frequently included weight loss (12%), hypertension (10%), proteinuria (10%), and diarrhea (10%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with and without prior exposure to VEGF therapy, the encouraging response rates, median

Original Article

However, patients with radioiodine-refractory DTC (RRDTC) have a 10-year survival rate of only 10% from the
detection of distant metastases.5 Consensus guidelines
have recommended clinical trials with systemic therapies
targeted to specific molecules, because traditional cytotoxic agents have demonstrated marginal efficacy and significant toxicities.6-8
Multiple molecular signaling pathways have been
implicated in the pathogenesis of DTC and are potential
targets for therapy.9 Specifically, alterations in several molecular signaling pathways, including B-raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF), v-ras oncogene
homolog (RAS), fibroblast growth factor receptor
(FGFR), and ret proto-oncogene (RET), have been implicated in the pathogenesis and proliferation of DTC. Furthermore, tumor angiogenesis, primarily mediated by
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2),
has been associated with metastatic disease, increased recurrence, and shorter disease-free survival.10 Receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) with activity on these
angiogenic pathways have demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials of patients with RR-DTC.11-13 Recently, 1 such
therapy (sorafenib) was approved by the US Food and
Drug Administration and by the European Medicines
Agency for the treatment of RR-DTC,13 and another TKI
(vandetanib) is currently being investigated in a phase 3
clinical study for the same indication. In addition, components of these signaling pathways—as well as others—
have been investigated for their potential to provide information with respect to patient prognosis or response to
TKI therapy in thyroid cancer.14,15
Lenvatinib (E7080; Eisai Inc, Woodcliff Lake NJ) is
an oral, multitargeted TKI of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and
VEGFR3; FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4;
platelet-derived growth factor receptor a (PDGFRa);
RET; and v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma viral
oncogene homolog (KIT).16-18 Preliminary evidence of
efficacy in phase 1 trials of lenvatinib in a variety of solid
tumor types, including the thyroid,19,20 prompted the initiation of this phase 2 trial to investigate its efficacy and
safety in patients with RR-DTC. In addition, this report
presents findings from the correlations of lenvatinib treatment outcomes with levels of circulating cytokines and
angiogenic factors (CAFs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT00784303) of oral lenvatinib for the
treatment of RR-DTC was conducted at 30 sites in 6
countries. Treatment consisted of lenvatinib 24 mg
2750

administered once daily for a minimum of eight 28-day
cycles; discontinuations occurred because of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal, or death.
Two patients received lenvatinib 10 mg twice daily before
a protocol amendment that identified the dose as 24 mg
once daily. Protocol-directed dose reductions occurred for
all grade 2 adverse events (AEs), except for hypertension, nausea, and vomiting, which were managed first by
optimum medical treatment. Once the dose was reduced,
it could not be increased. All patients provided signed
informed consent before entry, and the study was
approved by the institutional review board at each participating site and was carried out in accordance with the
Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance with an assurance filed with and approved by the US Department of
Health and Human Services.
PATIENTS
Patients were aged 18 years who had histologically confirmed DTC (including papillary, follicular, H€
urthle cell,
and poorly differentiated) that proved to be radioiodinerefractory (see online supporting information), evidence
of measurable and progressive disease (PD) (according to
modified Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors,
version 1.0)21 within the previous 12 months, and an
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status
of 0 to 2. The receipt of prior chemotherapy or antiangiogenic therapy was permitted; however, it must have been
discontinued at least 30 days before study entry. Patients
with anaplastic thyroid cancer; central nervous system metastasis; active hemoptysis; bleeding or thrombotic
disorders; receipt of anticoagulants; or significant cardiovascular, hematopoietic, hepatic, or renal dysfunction
were excluded.
Patient Monitoring and Tumor Assessment

Pretreatment tumor assessments using computed tomography scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, and other
areas of known or newly suspected disease were performed
within 4 weeks before the first dose and then every 8
weeks, and bone scans were obtained every 4 cycles.
Responses (complete response [CR] or partial response
[PR]) were confirmed at a repeat tumor evaluation at least
4 weeks after they were first observed. For a designation of
stable disease (SD) as the best overall response, at least 1
post-treatment measurement must have met SD criteria a
minimum of 7 weeks after the first dose. Patients who
achieved SD for 6 months or who had a PR but had progression in a single bony metastasis were permitted to
receive palliative radiotherapy at the single site followed

by the resumption of lenvatinib treatment. These patients
had previously met criteria for PD at the time progression
was documented in the single bone metastasis. Patients
who discontinued treatment before they developed PD
continued to undergo tumor assessment every 3 months
from the last assessment until PD was documented or different treatment was initiated. Blood samples for serum
protein biomarkers were collected at baseline (cycle 1, day
1), 8 days post-treatment (cycle 1, day 8), and 36 days
post-treatment (cycle 2, day 8).
Assessment of Clinical Endpoints

The primary endpoint was the objective response rate
(ORR), defined as a CR or a PR based on modified
Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors, version
1.0, by an independent imaging review (IIR). Secondary
endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, time to response, response duration, safety,
and tolerability. PFS was defined as the time during and
after treatment during which the patient was alive and
without PD. Prespecified subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint were based on the following criteria: age
(<65 years, 65 years), sex, race (white, nonwhite), and
previous receipt of VEGFR-targeted therapy.
Biomarker Assessments

A panel of 51 CAFs was assayed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and multiplex assays. Sample data acquisition and analysis were performed on either an
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader using
SoftmaxPro software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale,
Calif) or the Bio-Rad Bio-Plex System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, Calif) using Bio-Plex Manager 4.1 software for multiplex assays (Bio-Rad Laboratories). CAFs
for which >20% of patients had out-of-range measurements were not used for the correlative analyses.
Statistical Analyses

All patients who had received at least 1 dose of lenvatinib
(the intent-to-treat population) were included in the primary efficacy analyses. The safety population included all
patients who had received at least 1 dose of study medication and at least 1 post-treatment safety assessment. In
this study, the intent-to-treat and safety populations were
identical. The ORR was calculated at the end of the treatment phase, when patients had completed 8 cycles or
had discontinued before this, and are presented with 2sided 95% Clopper and Pearson confidence intervals
(CIs). Patient demographic data and safety parameters
were summarized using descriptive statistics. Sample size

estimates based on the Simon optimal 2-stage design
assumed a 5 .05, 90% power, and an expected ORR of
15% with lenvatinib compared with 2.5% based on historic controls. Unexpectedly rapid enrollment resulted in
completion of the second stage before the scheduled interim cutoff; consequently, the optimal 2-stage design was
not implemented. Median PFS and overall survival are
presented with 2-sided 95% CIs and were calculated using
the Kaplan-Meier method and plotted over time after
therapy. Clinical statistical analyses were performed using
Statistical Analysis System software (UNIX version 8.2
and Windows version 9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Post-treatment fold changes in serum biomarker levels from baseline (cycle 1, day 1) were analyzed using the
Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired samples. Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests also were used to analyze the correlation
of baseline serum biomarker levels and objective
responses. To test for associations between PFS and baseline serum biomarkers, log-transformed values were used
as independent variables in univariate Cox proportional
hazard models with Wald-test P values. False discovery
rate analyses were performed to adjust for multiple testing; however, unadjusted P values were considered
because of the exploratory nature of the biomarker analyses. Statistical analyses were performed using R version
2.15.0 or later (R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) with the survival and doMC (parallel
computation) packages.
RESULTS
Between October 2008 and February 2010, 58 patients
with DTC were treated (the intent-to-treat population)
(Table 1). The median patient age was 63 years, the
median weight was 81.1 kg, and most patients were
men (59%), white (86%), and had a baseline Eastern
Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 1
(93%). Prior VEGFR-targeted therapy was reported in
29% of patients. The most common sites of distant metastases were lung (93%), hilar-mediastinal lymph nodes
(57%), and bone (45%). Thirty-five patients (60%) discontinued treatment primarily for PD (31%) and AEs
(24%), in addition to patient choice (3%) and withdrawal of consent (2%); whereas 23 patients (40%) continued on treatment.
Efficacy

After a minimum follow-up of 14 months, the ORR was
50% (Clopper-Pearson 95% CI, 37%-63%) as assessed
by IIR, and only PRs were reported (Table 2). No differences in the ORR according to age or sex were observed

patients who had previously received sorafenib had PRs,
for an ORR of 71%. In an analysis of tumor response
according to histology, 24 of 43 patients (56%) with
papillary thyroid carcinoma and 5 of 15 patients (33%)
with follicular thyroid cancer had PRs. A difference in
ORR was observed between nonwhites and whites (Supporting Fig. 1; see online supporting information); however, this may have been because of the skewed racial
demographic of the study population (Table 1). Overall,
29 patients (50%) patients achieved a PR, 25 patients
(43%) attained SD (7 weeks), and 16 patients (28%)

was similar in patients who received (PFS, 12.2 months;
95% CI, 7.9 months to NE) or did not receive (PFS,

VEGFR-targeted therapy. The 6-month PFS rate was
78% (95% CI, 64%-87%), and the 12-month PFS rate

which patients were censored at the time of drug withdrawal (ie, at the last tumor assessment within 30 days
of the last study treatment), the median PFS was 15.9
months (95% CI, 10.8 months to NE) (Supporting Fig.

analysis, the median overall survival could not be reliably estimated based on the Kaplan-Meier analysis presented in Supporting Figure 3 (see online supporting

Treatment Duration and AEs

The median treatment duration was 13.5 cycles (range, 119 cycles). Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) led to dose
interruptions, reductions, or study drug withdrawal in
74%, 66%, and 26% of patients, respectively. All patients
experienced TEAEs, which most frequently were hypertension (76%), weight decrease (69%), diarrhea (67%), proteinuria (64%), fatigue (60%), decreased appetite (52%),
and nausea (50%) (Table 3). Most hypertension and proCancer

teinuria events were grade 1 or 2 and were managed without dose adjustments or withdrawal of treatment.
Common toxicity criteria grade 3 or 4 TEAEs
occurred in 42 patients (72%). Six grade 4 TEAEs were
reported and included hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, abasia,
and acute myocardial infarction (1 report each) and 2
reports of pulmonary embolism. However, no grade 4
events occurred in 5% of patients. Grade 3 TEAEs that
occurred in at least 5% of patients included weight loss
(12%); hypertension, proteinuria, and diarrhea (10% each);
fatigue (9%); dehydration (9%); and arthralgia (5%).
TEAEs that led to lenvatinib withdrawal and occurred in at
least 2 patients were proteinuria (5%), pulmonary embolism (3%), and deep vein thrombosis (3%). Skin-related
TEAEs included palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE)
syndrome (22%; including grade 3 PPE in 1 patient [2%]),
rash (14%), dry skin (14%), and alopecia (9%).
Nonfatal, serious AEs occurred in 28 patients
(48%), and those that occurred in at least 2 patients
included dehydration (7%), hypotension (5%), pulmonary embolism, lower abdominal pain, hypertension, and
cardiac failure (3% each). Three deaths occurred within
30 days of the last dose of lenvatinib: 1 patient died from

Original Article

PD, and 2 patients died after serious AEs (1 arterial hemorrhage and 1 cardiac arrest).
DISCUSSION
Historically, there have been limited treatment options
for patients with RR-DTC. Multitargeted TKI agents
under investigation for the treatment of RR-DTC have
demonstrated response rates ranging between 8% and
49% and PFS ranging between 10.8 months and 18.1
months.13,22-26 In the current study, lenvatinib treatment
was associated with an ORR of 50% (all PRs), as determined by IIR, and a durable (23 weeks) SD rate of
28%. The median PFS was 12.6 months. Similar tumor
responses were observed for patients who did or did not
receive prior VEGFR-targeted therapy. This finding may
have important clinical implications, because the use of
VEGFR-targeted therapy in RR-DTC is likely to increase
in the near future given the approval of sorafenib and lenvatinib as well as the investigation of vandetanib in a phase
3 trial for this indication.
All patients who received treatment on this
study had PD within the 12 months before enrollment. The mean sum size of target lesions in these
patients was 11.7 cm, and nearly half of the patients
(45%) had bone metastasis. It is noteworthy that the
majority of patients in this study were men (59%),
consistent with other clinical trials of DTC.22,25
Although DTC is more prevalent in women, men
typically have a worse prognosis,27 which may explain
their over-representation in clinical studies.
Although comparisons cannot be drawn from different clinical trials, the median PFS for lenvatinib of
12.6 months in our study was similar to that reported
in the literature for patients who received other multitargeted TKIs.13,22-26 Although those trials supported
the use of multitargeted TKIs, they had different entry
criteria, and some also included medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers, which behave quite differently.28
Not all studies required evidence of disease progression
for eligibility, which was required in the current study.
It is difficult to determine whether the inclusion of
patients with SD in the other studies may have influenced observed efficacy.
Lenvatinib had a toxicity profile principally characterized by hypertension, proteinuria, fatigue, and gastrointestinal complaints, which generally were manageable
with standard medical care and dose interruption or
reduction when necessary. TEAEs resulted in dose interruptions, reductions, or treatment withdrawals in 74%,
66%, and 26% of patients, respectively. Grade 3 or 4
2754

TEAEs were experienced by 72% of patients, and 48% of
patients had nonfatal, serious AEs. The most common
grade 3 TEAEs were weight decrease (12%); hypertension, proteinuria, and diarrhea (10% each); and fatigue
and dehydration (9% each). Hypertension and proteinuria have been commonly reported for other VEGFRtargeted therapies.22,29 Most patients with hypertension
and proteinuria were managed successfully without lenvatinib dose adjustments. It is noteworthy that, in the current trial, skin-related TEAEs—specifically grade 1 or 2
rash—occurred in 8 patients (14%), and grade 3 PPE syndrome occurred in 1 patient (2%). There were 3
treatment-emergent deaths, including 1 patient who died
after experiencing an arterial hemorrhage and 1 patient
who died after a cardiac arrest. Thromboembolic events
are known AEs associated with VEGFR inhibitors.30
These findings underscore the importance of careful
screening to ensure that only patients who have clinically
significant disease are included for treatment.
In this hypothesis-generating, exploratory biomarker analysis, changes were observed in the levels of 16
of the 51 CAFs assessed after 8 days of lenvatinib treatment. These included increases in the VEGFR ligands
VEGFA and placental growth factor and decreases in
angiopoietin-2, soluble TEK tyrosine kinase 2 (TIE2),
and soluble VEGFR2. Angiopoietins, including
angiopoietin-2, are ligands of TIE2; and together with
VEGFA, they form a critical interface of the angiogenic
network to promote the initiation and maturation of new
blood vessels.31,32 The angiopoietin-2/angiopoietin-1/
TIE2 axis may either promote or inhibit the formation of
tumors in different contexts.32 The exact role of
angiopoietin-2 in this signaling pathway is complex, acting as either an antagonist or a partial agonist for TIE2.
Nevertheless, anticancer approaches that inhibit
angiopoietin-2 to augment VEGF-targeted therapies
appeared promising in preclinical and early clinical studies.33 In addition, angiogenic factors like angiopoietin-2
are potential markers for resistance to therapy, and upregulation of angiopoietin-2 has been implicated in the
development of resistance to antiangiogenic TKIs in other
cancers.34,35 These findings warrant further investigation
in a larger population.
In summary, our trial of once-daily oral lenvatinib in patients with RR-DTC demonstrated an ORR
of 50%, a time to response of 3.6 months, and a
median PFS of 12.6 months, supporting further evaluation of lenvatinib in this patient population. Results
from an international, multicenter, randomized phase
3 trial recently were published.36
