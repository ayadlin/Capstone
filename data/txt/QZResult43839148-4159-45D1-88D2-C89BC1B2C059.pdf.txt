Abstract
Despite the frequent presence of an insulin-like growth factor
I receptor (IGFIR)-mediated autocrine loop in osteosarcoma
(OS), interfering with this target was only moderately effective
in preclinical studies. Here, we considered other members
of the IGF system that might be involved in the molecular
pathology of OS. We found that, among 45 patients with OS,
IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum levels were significantly lower, and
IGF-II serum levels significantly higher, than healthy controls.
Increased IGF-II values were associated with a decreased
disease-free survival. After tumor removal, both IGF-I and
IGF-II levels returned to normal values. In 23 of 45 patients,
we obtained tissue specimens and found that all expressed
high mRNA level of IGF-II and >IGF-I. Also, isoform A of the
insulin receptor (IR-A) was expressed at high level in addition
to IGFIR and IR-A/IGFIR hybrids receptors (HRA). These
receptors were also expressed in OS cell lines, and simultaneous impairment of IGFIR, IR, and Hybrid-Rs by monoclonal
antibodies, siRNA, or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor BMS536924, which blocks both IGFIR and IR, was more effective
than selective anti-IGFIR strategies. Also, anti–IGF-II-siRNA
treatment in low-serum conditions significantly inhibited
MG-63 OS cells that have an autocrine circuit for IGF-II. In
summary, IGF-II rather than IGF-I is the predominant growth
factor produced by OS cells, and three different receptors
(IR-A, HRA, and IGFIR) act complementarily for an IGF-II–
mediated constitutive autocrine loop, in addition to the previously shown IGFIR/IGF-I circuit. Cotargeting IGFIR and
IR-A is more effective than targeting IGF-IR alone in inhibiting
OS growth. [Cancer Res 2009;69(6):2443–52]

Introduction
Although combination treatments have significantly improved
the prognosis of osteosarcoma (OS; ref. 1), the survival rate has
now reached a plateau (2, 3), and further improvements may
only derive from a better understanding of molecular pathology
(4–7), particularly mechanisms underlying bone growth and
remodeling. In fact, the peak incidence of OS coincides with
adolescent growth spurt, and the observed association between OS

and height (8–10) suggests the importance of growth factors and
receptors involved in skeletal growth (11). Among these, insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF-I) also promotes the initiation and progression
of many malignancies, including sarcomas (12, 13). The IGF-I/IGFIR
autocrine circuit is relevant for OS growth, in vitro (14, 15), and in
clinical settings (16, 17), although therapies against IGFIR have only
resulted in a limited beneficial effect (5, 18). Less attention has been
paid to the other cognate stimulator of the IGF signaling pathway,
IGF-II. Under physiologic conditions, IGF-II is abundantly stored in
the bone matrix (19), and during fetal development, IGF-II
expression is higher than in the postnatal life (20). In most tissues,
IGF-II is maternally imprinted (21), but this imprinting is usually
lost in cancer (22, 23), leading to IGF-II biallelic production that
provides an increased growth-promoting signaling. IGF-II mRNA is
expressed by human OS cell lines and tissues (11, 16, 18), and IGF-II
loss of imprinting has been shown in OS (24).
Although IGF-I and IGF-II both interact the same receptor,
IGFIR, IGF-II can also bind with high affinity to the isoform A of
insulin receptor, IR-A. IR-A is generally expressed at lower levels
than IR-B, although this is not the case in fetal and cancer cells
(25). An autocrine loop mediated by IR-A/IGF-II is present in
leiomyosarcoma (26), where it is crucial for cell proliferation and
migration.
Both IR and IGFIR are tetrameric complexes consisting of two
identical extracellular a-subunits that bind insulin, and two
identical h-subunits that have tyrosine kinase activity. In cells
and tissues coexpressing both IR and IGFIR, hybrid-receptors (HR)
can be formed by one a-and oneh-subunit IR heterodimer, and
one a-and one h-subunit IGFIR heterodimer (27, 28). The affinity
of IGF-I and IGF-II for these HR is still unclear (29); however, all
tissues expressing IR and IGF-IR also express HR, leading to an
additional IGF/HR circuit.
In this study, we evaluated the serum levels of IGF-I and IGF-II
in OS patients, and the expression of IR, IGF-IR, and HR in OS
specimens. We also compared the effects of different strategies
aimed at inhibiting IGF-II, or IGFIR, or both IR and IGFIR. Our
findings indicate that, in addition to the IGFIR/IGF-I autocrine
loop, other circuits, mediated by IR-A and HR, are activated by
IGF-II and are relevant for the molecular pathology of OS.

Primary antibodies against (a) anti-IGFIR: aIR-3 MAb (Oncogene
Research), 17-69 MAb obtained as described (27) and C-20 polyclonal
antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); and against (b) anti-IR: MA-20 MAb,
CT-1 MAb, 83-7 MAb obtained as described (27), 83-14 MAb (Biomeda), and
a polyclonal rabbit antibody (Becton Dickinson).
Subjects and sample collection. Fifty-three patients with newly
diagnosed high-grade OS were seen at our institution from May 2002
through July 2005, signed informed consent regarding the use of their
biological materials for research studies, and entered the study. At
presentation, seven patients had detectable pulmonary metastases and
four multiple localizations. Blood and tumor tissues were collected after the
institutional ethical committee approval.
Serum samples were obtained from 45 of 53 patients (33 males and 12
females; age, 13 F 1 y) before treatment and from 17 age-paired healthy
controls (8 males and 9 females; age, 12 F 1 y). In 9 patients, serum was also
collected 12 mo since diagnosis, after treatment completion. Tissue
specimens were collected from 23 OS untreated patients. In 15 cases,
serum and biopsy samples were available from the same individuals.
Hence, the 53 patients were subdivided in 3 subgroups, depending on
the availability of biological materials: (a) subgroup A (n = 45), patients in
which serum samples were available; (b) subgroup B (n = 35), a fraction
of patients of subgroup A, characterized by the absence of metastases
at presentation; and (c) subgroup C (n = 23), patients in which tissue
specimens were retrieved (Table 1). The median follow-up of patients of
subgroup B, treated by surgery plus multiagent chemotherapy (30), was
54 mo (minimum 34 mo). Adverse events were defined as tumor recurrence
at any site or death during remission. The event-free survival duration was
calculated from the date of diagnosis. Results were updated in February
2008: 24 patients (68.6%) were disease free, 9 (25.7%) had metastases, and
2 (5.7%) had both local recurrence and metastases.
Cell lines. Saos-2 and MG-63 human OS cell lines, purchased from the
American Type Culture Collection, were cultured in IMDM plus 20 units/mL
penicillin, 100 Ag/mL streptomycin, 10% FCS (complete medium), and
incubated at 37jC in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere.
IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 measurement. Serum levels or protein
content in the cell lysates of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 were measured by
ELISA (Diagnostic Systems Laboratory). Protein lysates were obtained using
radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer [RIPA; 0.05 mol/L Tris-HCl (pH 7.4),
150 mmol/L NaCl, 5% Triton X-100, 1 mmol/L EGTA, 1 mmol/L NaF] from
semiconfluent cells. Protein content was measured by the Bradford assay.
IGFIR, IR, and HR in tissue specimens and cell lines. IGFIR, IR,
and HR were measured by ELISA as described (27). Frozen tissues were
pulverized in the presence of liquid nitrogen. Powdered tissues or subconfluent cell monolayers were solubilized with RIPA buffer supplemented
with complete protease inhibitor cocktail, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
1 mmol/L, and Na3VO4 0.2 mmol/L. Protein content was measured by the
Bradford assay.
To immunocapture different receptors, specific MAb that do not crossreact with other receptors were used (27) as follows: against IR, MA-20;
against IGFIR, aIR-3; and against HR, 83-7. Th secondary MAb used were as
follows: against IR, CT-1 biotinylated; against IGFIR, 17-69 biotinylated; and
against HR, 17-69 biotinylated.
Isolation of mRNA and reverse transcription-PCR. Messenger RNA
from powdered tissues or from semiconfluent cells was extracted using
TRIzol reagent. Total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the
Advantage RT-for-PCR kit. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) consisted in

one denaturation at 94jC for 5 min, 30 cycles of amplification (denaturation
at 94jC for 30 s, annealing at the specific temperature for 30 s, and
extension at 72jC for 45 s), and a final extension at 72jC for 7 min. Forward
and reverse primers:
IGF-I: 5¶-GATGCACACCATGTCCTCCT-3¶, 5¶-TCCTGCGGTGGCATGTCACT-3¶
IGF-II: 5¶-CTGGTGGACACCCTCCAGTTC-3¶, 5¶-GCCCACGGGGTATCTGGGGAA-3¶
IR: 5¶-AACCAGAGTGAGTATGAGGAT-3¶, 5¶-CCGTTCCAGAGCGAAGTGCTT-3¶
h-actin: 5¶-TCTGGCACCACACCTTCTACAATGAGCTGCG-3¶, 5¶-CGTCATACTCCTGCTTGCTGATCCACATCTGC-3¶.
Products were separated by electrophoresis. A digital image was acquired
by the Gel Doc XR system, and the signal intensity was quantified by
Quantity One (Bio-Rad) and related to h-actin signal. RT-PCR was replicated
thrice.
Cell growth after treatment with IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin. Cells were
seeded in 12-well plates (30,000 cells per well) in complete medium and,
after 24 h, incubated with serum-free medium. After an additional 24 h,
IGF-I, IGF-II, or porcine insulin (10 nmol/L) were added, and after 3 d, cells
were counted by trypan blue. The assay was repeated thrice in duplicate.
Immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitation
was performed to detect IGFIR or IR phosphorylation, and Western blot
was made to detect extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and IRS-1
phosphorylation in total lysates. For immunoprecipitation, subconfluent
cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then exposed to IGF-I, IGF-II, or
insulin (10 nmol/L) for 15 min. In BMS536924 assay, cells were pretreated
for 1 h in serum-free medium with the drug (0.00–0.25–1.00–5.00 Amol/L),
and then exposed for 15 min to IGF-II (10 nmol/L). For direct
immunoblotting of total protein, cells were serum starved for 24 h and
then treated for 5, 15, and 60 min with IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin (10 nmol/L).
In BMS536924 assay, cells were pretreated for 1 h in serum-free conditions
with BMS536924 (0.00–0.01–0.10–0.25–0.50–1.00–2.50–5.00 Amol/L) and
then incubated for 15 min with IGF-II (10 nmol/L). Protein lysates were
obtained in RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors. Protein-Gplus-agarose beads were shaken with 500 Ag of lysates and with aIR-3 MAb
or anti–IR 83-14 MAb. The pelleted beads were resuspended in SDS
sample buffer, boiled, centrifuged, and the supernatants were resolved by
electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel. Blots were probed with C-20 antiIGFIR or with anti-IR rabbit polyclonal antibodies, or with anti–phosphoIGFIR/IR MAb.
For Western blot analysis, equal amounts of protein lysates were
subjected to reducing SDS-PAGE on a polyacrylamide gel, transferred to
nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Blots
were probed with Phospho-44/42 MAP kinase or p44/42 MAP kinase or
Phospho-IRS-1, or IRS-1 polyclonal antibodies. Incubation with a horseradish peroxidase–conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies followed.
To detect different antigens within the same blot, nitrocellulose membranes
were stripped with Restore Western Blot Stripping buffer and reprobed.
The reaction was revealed by a chemiluminescence substrate (LiteAblot).
Immunoprecipitation and direct immunoblot assays were repeated thrice.
IRS-1 cell localization. Starved cells were cultured on glass coverslips
for 24 h. IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin were then added for 4 h (30–100–300 nmol/L).
Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and 300 mmol/L sucrose, and
permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Coverslips were incubated with anti–
IRS-1 polyclonal antibody, then with FITC-coniugated anti-rabbit polyclonal
antibody in PBS containing propidium iodide (1 Ag/AL) and RNase A
(10 Ag/mL), and observed by confocal microscopy with argon and heliumneon lasers (D-Eclipse C-1; Nikon). This assay was repeated twice. Cells with
IRS-1 nuclear localization were counted in three different fields (positive
cells per 100 cells).
Cell proliferation blockade. a) Antibodies and tyrosine kinase inhibitor
blocking strategies. Cells were seeded in 12-well plates (30,000 cells per well)
in complete medium. After 24 h, medium was changed with new complete
medium containing aIR-3 anti-IGFIR MAb (1 Ag/mL), or S1F2 anti–IGF-II

MAb (2 Ag/mL), or the 2 combined MAb, or the MOPC-21 control MAb
(1 Ag/mL), or BMS536924 (BMS; 0.05–0.10–0.50–1.00–5.00 Amol/L). Cell
growth was evaluated by trypan blue at 72 and 144 h. Growth curves were
repeated twice, in duplicate. b) siRNA blocking strategy. Specific gene
silencing effect was evaluated by siRNA technology associated with pipettetype electroporation. Cells were trypsinized at semiconfluence and counted
by trypan blue. Fifteen microliters of cell suspension containing 300,000
cells and 2 pmol of specific or control siRNA were transferred into a
1-mm cuvette, and an electrical field was applied to induce siRNA cellular
internalization (MicroPorator MP-100; Digital BioTechnology). For the assay
with anti–IR-siRNA and anti–IGFIR-siRNA, after electroporation, Saos-2
cells were transferred into 2 mL of complete growth medium and seeded in
6-well plates (150,000 cells per well). After 4 d, cells were counted by trypan
blue and lysated. Protein lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis for
IGFIR, IR, and tubulin (anti–a-tubulin B7 MAb). Growth assay was repeated
twice in duplicate. For the assays with anti–IGF-II-siRNA, after electroporation, MG-63 were transferred into 2 mL of medium with 0.5% FCS, and
seeded in 6-well plates (600,000 cells per well). After 4 d, cells were counted
by trypan blue and lysated. Five micrograms of total proteins were used for
the IGF-II ELISA assay. The growth curve and IGF-II assay were repeated
twice in duplicate.
Blocking strategies on tumorigenesis. Anchorage-independent growth
was evaluated after exposure to MAb against IGFIR and/or IGF-II. Saos-2
and MG-63 were exposed to aIR-3 MAb (1 Ag/mL), S1F2 MAb (2 Ag/mL),
both, or to control MAb (1 Ag/mL) for 3 d, and then seeded (3300 cells/
plate) in 0.33% agarose with a 0.5% agarose underlay (SeaPlaque Agarose)
in complete medium. After incubation at 37jC for 5 to 6 d, colonies
of >125 Am were counted. Results were expressed as percentages. The
experiment was performed in duplicate and repeated twice.
Statistical analysis. Statistics was performed with the StatViewTM 5.0.1
software (SAS Institute). Due to the low number of observations, data were
considered as not normally distributed, and nonparametric tests were used.
The Mann-Whitney U test was used for the difference between groups, the
Wilcoxon Rank test was used for the difference of paired values in patients
before and after treatment, and the Spearman rank test was used for the
correlation between continuous variables. To evaluate the prognostic
performance of IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3, the 95th percentile of control
group was used as a threshold value in Kaplan-Meier plots and in the logrank test.

Results
IGFs and IGFBP-3 serum levels. IGF-I serum levels of OS
patients (n = 45) were significantly lower than those of agematched controls (n = 17; median, 168.0 ng/mL; range, 50.0–452.0
ng/mL versus 303.0 ng/mL; range, 92.0–559.0 ng/mL, respectively;
P = 0.0005). In contrast, IGF-II serum levels were significantly
higher (median, 949.0 ng/mL; range, 402.0–1786.0 ng/mL versus
749.0 ng/mL; range, 590.0–979.0 ng/mL; P = 0.0191; Fig. 1A). No
correlation was found between IGF-I and IGF-II levels. IGFBP-3
serum levels were significantly lower (n = 40) than controls (n =
16; median, 3811.9 ng/mL; range, 1746.6–5256.8 ng/mL versus
4342.0 ng/mL; range, 3276.6–5293.1 ng/mL; P = 0.0203; Fig. 1A).
As expected, serum levels of IGFBP-3 were positively related
both to IGF-I (P < 0.0001; r = 0.561) and IGF-II (P = 0.0033; r =
0.396) values.
In a subgroup of 9 unrelapsed patients, in which blood samples
were obtained both at diagnosis and after 12 months, at the
completion of surgical and chemotherapeutic treatments, both
IGF-I and IGF-II levels turned to normal values (P = 0.021 and 0.007
versus values at presentation, respectively; Fig. 1B).
Serum IGF-I, IGF-II, and IGFBP-3 levels were examined in
relation to event-free survival. Increased IGF-II serum levels were
significantly associated with a decreased probability of remaining
free of disease (P = 0.0372), which was 50% in patients with high
IGF-II levels (above 944 ng/mL) and 84% in patients with normal
IGF-II levels (Fig. 1C). In contrast, both IGF-I and IGFBP-3 serum
levels were not associated with an adverse outcome.
IGFs, IR, IGFIR, and HR expression in OS tissue. In 23 OS
tissue specimens, we measured IGFIR, IR, and HR protein content.
Receptor content was considered positive if equal or above 0.3 ng/
100 Ag protein. IGFIR was positive in 20 of 23, IR in 21 of 23, and
HR in 23 of 23. Interestingly, the HR exceeded IGFIR in 19 of 23
cases (Table 2; Fig. 1D, top). There was a significant correlation
between IGFIR and HR expression (P = 0.0053; r = 0.594) but not
between IR and HR.

The analysis of the expression of the two IR isoforms by RT-PCR
indicated that IR-A was expressed in 19 of 19 cases, whereas IR-B
was expressed only in 6 of 19 OS (Table 2; Fig. 1D, bottom).
IGF-II mRNA was abundantly present in 17 of 19 cases, and IGF-I
mRNA in 14 of 19 cases (Table 2). IR-A was always higher than IR-B.
Taken together, these data indicate that human OS produce large
amounts of IGF-II, to a greater extent than IGF-I, and that they also
express the IR-A and HR rather than IGFIR.
Effects of IGFs and insulin on OS cell proliferation. The role
of IGF-II, IR-A, and HR in OS was further investigated in two cell
lines. In Saos-2 only IR-A was expressed, whereas in MG-63 both
isoforms were expressed, with IR-B prevalence (Fig. 2A). In Saos-2,
IGFIR was 5.7 ng, IR was 1.5 ng, and HR was 7.2 ng/0.1 mg total
protein, whereas in MG-63, IGFIR was 0.9 ng, IR was 2.6 ng, and HR
was 2.2 ng/0.1 mg. In both cell lines, the amount of HR was higher

than IGFIR. We also quantified the intracellular content for IGF-I
and IGF-II. Saos-2 expressed low levels of IGF-I (0.1 ng/0.1 mg
protein), whereas MG-63 did not express detectable amount of
IGF-I. Adversely, MG-63 had a high content of IGF-II (29.3 ng/
0.1 mg protein) that was not detectable in Saos-2. In Saos-2 that
secrete low level of IGFs, in serum-free conditions, exogenously
added IGF-I and IGF-II induced a significant increase of
proliferation compared with untreated cells (P = 0.0495 and
0.0433, respectively), whereas insulin had no effect (Fig. 2B).
The intracellular pathway activation of the IGF system was
evaluated by immunoblotting. The presence of a mild phosphorylation of IR, ERK, and IRS-1 in unstimulated MG-63 is consistent
with the presence of a strong autocrine circuit for IGF-II (Fig. 2C).
In Saos-2, the phosphorylation of IGFIR and IR, and a timedependent phosphorylation of ERK and IRS-1, was observed after

both IGF-I and IGF-II stimulation. Insulin effect was observed only
at 60 minutes for ERK, and at 15 to 60 minutes for IRS-1. In MG-63,
a strong phosphorylation of IR, IGFIR, and a time-dependent
phosphorylation of ERK and IRS-1 was induced by both IGF-I and
IGF-II (Fig. 2C). A strong IR and IRS-1 activation was also observed
after exposure to insulin.
Because previous studies had shown that IRS-1 is translocated
to the nucleus when IGF-I–mediated nuclear translocation of
h-catenin is required in actively growing cells (31, 32), we compared
the ability of IGFs and insulin to induce IRS-1 nuclear translocation.
IRS-1 was absent in the nucleus under basal conditions, but after
exposure to IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin, the number of cells with
nuclear localization of IRS-1 significantly increased (P = 0.0495;
Fig. 2D, top). This phenomenon was more evident in Saos-2, and
seemed to be higher after IGF-II stimulation.
Effects of IGFIR and/or IR blocking strategies. We evaluated
the antiproliferative effect of IGFIR blocking strategies, alone or in
combination with IGF-II deprivation or IR inhibition. Cells were
incubated with anti-IGFIR aIR-3 antibody and/or with anti–IGF-II
S1F2 antibody. At 144 hours cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by a-IR3 (P = 0.0209 for Saos-2; P = 0.0209 for MG-63; Fig. 3A).
A synergistic effect was obtained with a combined treatment with

www.aacrjournals.org

S1F2 and aIR-3 (P = 0.0209 for Saos-2; P = 0.0209 for MG-63). No
significant inhibition effect was observed with S1F2 antibody alone.
A significant inhibition was detected after treatment with the
control antibody in MG-63 (P = 0.0209) but not in Saos-2.
Although our main interest was to elucidate the role of IR-A
in OS, an efficient and specific anti–IR-A-siRNA is difficult to
obtain because these differ only for the presence of exon 11. We
therefore used an anti–IR-siRNA that cannot distinguish between
the two isoforms. The growth inhibition effect of the anti–IRsiRNA compared with control anti–IR-siRNA was significant (P =
0.0209; Fig. 3B, top), as for anti–IGFIR-siRNA treatment compared
with control anti–IGFIR-siRNA (P = 0.0209). The combined treatment with anti–IGFIR-siRNA and anti–IR-siRNA was more effective than treatments with IGFIR siRNA or IR siRNA treatment
alone or no treatment (P = 0.0209 for all conditions; Fig. 3B, top).
Moreover, the combined treatment with anti–IGFIR-siRNA and
anti–IR-siRNA was significantly more effective than the combined
two controls (P = 0.0209). Proliferation inhibition was paralleled
by the specific expression impairment of the targeted protein by
siRNA (Fig. 3B, bottom).
To evaluate the effect of impairment of the autocrine production of IGF-II in OS cells, we used an anti–IGF-II-siRNA only with

MG-63 because Saos-2 cells do not express IGF-II. Anti–IGF-IIsiRNA treatment markedly decreased IGF-II protein content (1.3 F
0.5 ng/100 Ag for treated cells, 24.9 F 2.1 ng/100 Ag for untreated
cells), whereas control siRNA had no effect (24.5 F 2.9 ng/100 Ag).
In low-serum condition, the anti–IGF-II-siRNA also significantly
inhibited cells proliferation (P = 0.0209; Fig. 3C).

We then evaluated the antitumorigenic effect of aIR-3 and S1F2
MAb (Fig. 3D). Consistently with the proliferation assay, inhibition
of colony formation was significant for cells treated with aIR-3 and
S1F2 MAb in combination (P = 0.0209 for both cell lines), and with
aIR-3 MAb, or with S1F2 MAb for Saos-2 (P = 0.0209 in both cases),
but not for MG-63. Treatment with the control MAb was ineffective

OS cells. A significant growth inhibition at 144 hours was observed
at a z0.5 Amol/L dosage (P = 0.0209 for both cell lines) and at
0.1 mmol/L for MG-63 (P = 0.0304). In addition, in starved cells
stimulated with IGF-II, increasing dosages of BMS-536924 reduced
the phosphorylation of IGFIR/IR and of mitogen-activated protein
kinase/ERK with a complete inhibition at 5.0 Amol/L (Fig. 4B).

Discussion
Under physiologic conditions, IGF-I produced by osteoblasts is an
important regulator of bone cell metabolism and skeletal development under GH control (34). OS, which is likely to originate from a
transformed osteoprogenitor cell (7), also secretes IGF-I (18), and
this may be detected in the serum of OS patients. The IGF-I/IGFIR

Insulin Receptor Isoform A in Human Osteosarcoma

autocrine circuit has long been considered as a key mechanism for
the proliferation and survival of OS cells (11, 14, 16–18). However,
circulating concentrations of IGF-I and its binding protein IGFBP-3
are not predictive of tumor incidence and/or clinical behavior (35),
and therapeutic strategies that specifically block the binding of
IGF-I to IGFIR have been only partially effective (5, 18). The lack of
a significant therapeutic benefit suggests a redundancy within the
IGF pathway. We therefore investigated whether other components
of the IGF system are involved in OS pathogenesis.
In contrast to rodent bone cells, human bone cells produce less
IGF-I than IGF-II, its cognate ligand (36–38). IGF-II has an
important role during fetal development (20, 39), and during adult
life, it is the most abundant growth factor stored in bones (37). Like
IGF-I, IGF-II regulates bone cell metabolism and remodeling (40). In
this study, for the first time, we report that IGF-II serum levels are
significantly higher in OS patients compared with age-matched
controls. In contrast to IGF-II, IGF-I, and IGFBP-3 are significantly
lower than in controls. After tumor removal and chemotherapy, IGF
levels return to normal values, suggesting that their variation is
due to the presence of the tumor. These findings suggest that in OS
patients the GH-IGF-I axis might be influenced by the increased
serum levels of IGF-II produced by OS cells, as previously shown in
sarcomas (41). Under this hypothesis, after tumor removal, IGF-II
serum levels decrease and, as a consequence, GH secretion is no
longer inhibited, leading to an increase of IGF-I serum levels. We did
not evaluate the GH serum levels in this study due to the lack
of multiple sequential sampling. Increased circulating IGF-II in OS
patients might be related to the previously observed association
between OS development and height, at least in growing individuals
(10), as also suggested by an IGF-II role in prepubertal individual
stature (42).
The relevance of IGF-II role in the biology of OS is also suggested
by the significant correlation between high IGF-II levels and a poor
prognosis in a homogeneous subset of patients. It is likely that
increased IGF-II secreted by OS cells that express IGFIR (18) may
activate an IGF-II/IGFIR autocrine loop that promotes cell proliferation and survival. In our series, we observed IGF-II mRNA
in all OS tissue specimens. The IGFIR expression, however, was
observed in most but not all OS cases. We, therefore, explored
whether IGF-II could be active via another component of the IGF
system, the IR isoform A, which results from alternative splicing of
the IR gene (43) and plays an important role in embryonal and fetal
development (25, 44, 45), and that is able to bind with high affinity
to IGF-II (25). IR-A is overexpressed in several cancers (25, 27,
46, 47), including sarcomas (26, 48). In our series, IR-A was the
predominant IR isoform in all cases. IR-A or IR-B heterodimers
may combine with IGFIR heterodimers to form hybrid receptors
that are often the most represented IGF system receptors. HRA
binds with high affinity and is activated by both IGF-I and IGF-II
(27, 28). In our series, HR were always expressed and, in most cases,
their expression level was significantly higher than that of IGFIR,
indicating a relevant role of IGF-II in OS biology, and the existence
of autocrine loops mediated by at least three different receptors
(IR-A, HRA, and IGFIR) that are alternatives to the less frequent
IGFIR/IGF-II circuit.

The complex mechanism activated by IGF signaling in OS was
confirmed in two OS cell lines that have an IGF-I/IGFIR autocrine
circuit (18, 49). In Saos-2, we found the expression of IGFIR, IR-A,
and HRA, in MG-63 of IGFIR, IR-A, IR-B, and HR. We also found a
strong autocrine circuit for IGF-II in MG-63, and a mild autocrine
circuit for IGF-I in Saos-2. According to our data on OS patients,
MG-63 cell line is more representative of clinical OS that secrete
IGF-II, as indirectly shown. The crucial role of IGF-II autocrine
circuit in OS cells was also shown by the use of an anti–IGF-IIsiRNA that significantly inhibited MG-63 proliferation.
We then verified the effects of different ligands of the IGF system
on cell proliferation and signaling. We found that IGF-II autocrine pathway in MG-63 is responsible for the phosphorylation of
receptors under basal conditions, and that the expression pattern
of receptors is very complex and the responsiveness to the different
ligands is greatly redundant. In particular, there are three receptors
(IGFIR, IR-A, and HRA) for Saos-2, and six receptors (IGFIR, IR-A,
IR-B, HRA, HRB, and Hybrids IR-A/IR-B) for MG-63, and the ligands
(IGF-I, IGF-II, and insulin) can bind to and activate all these
receptors. Therefore, it is hard to distinguish on which receptor
each ligand is inducing the signaling cascade. We can only assume
that in Saos-2, both IGF-I and IGF-II significantly promote cell
growth, whereas only a slight effect is induced by insulin, and that
the ligand-stimulation by either IGF-I, IGF-II, or insulin in both cell
lines induce a strong phosphorylation and activation of receptors
and of second messengers.
Considering the complexity of the IGF system in OS, blocking
strategies specific for IGFIR or IR alone are unlikely to be
successful, and in fact, selective IGFIR signaling inhibition was
found to cause only limited effects (5, 18), whereas the use of an
IGF-II sequestering MAb, combined with a IGFIR sequestering
MAb, produced a stronger inhibition of both OS cell proliferation
and tumorigenesis. In particular, IGF-II depletion alone was not
effective in blocking tumor cell proliferation probably because of
the presence of IGF-I. Similar results were obtained by selectively
inhibiting IGFIR mRNA expression or IR mRNA expression or both
by specific siRNA, or by selectively inhibiting with the tyrosine
kinase inhibitor BMS-536924, which blocks both IGFIR and IR.
In conclusion, our data confirm the importance of the IGF
signaling system in OS. In particular, IR-A and HRA, both activated
by IGF-II in addition to IGF-I, are involved. Our data suggest that
cotargeting IGFIR and IR is likely to be more effective than
targeting IGFIR alone.
