ABSTRACT:
The development of effective therapies inhibiting prostate cancer progression
and metastasis may substantially impact prostate cancer mortality and potentially
reduce the rates of invasive treatments by enhancing the safety of active surveillance
strategies. Hepsin (HPN) is a cell surface serine protease amplified in a subset of
human sarcomas (7.2%), as well as in ovarian (10%), lung adeno (5.4%), lung
squamous cell (4.5%), adenoid cystic (5%), breast (2.6%), uterine (1.7%) and colon
(1.4%) carcinomas. While HPN is not amplified in prostate cancer, it is one of the
most prominently overexpressed genes in the majority of human prostate tumors and
genetic experiments in mice indicate that Hepsin promotes prostate cancer metastasis,
particularly metastasis to the bone marrow. We report here the development,
analysis and animal trial of the small-molecule Hepsin inhibitor HepIn-13. Long-term
exposure to HepIn-13 inhibited bone, liver and lung metastasis in a murine model
of metastatic prostate cancer. These findings indicate that inhibition of Hepsin with
small-molecule compounds could provide an effective tool for attenuation of prostate
cancer progression and metastasis.

INTRODUCTION

Previous studies indicate that Hepsin overexpression
plays an important role in prostate and ovarian cancer
[12-15]. The levels of Hepsin expression correlate with
the high Gleason score and are indicative of poor clinical
outcome and relapse after prostatectomy [3-6]. Hepsin
is not overexpressed in prostate cancer cell lines and
overexpression of Hepsin in cells in culture results in cell
detachment and downregulation of cell proliferation [16,
17]. Hepsin upregulation in the context of the prostate
gland in vivo promotes SV40 large T antigen-driven
prostate cancer progression and metastasis to the liver,
lung and bone [12]. Furthermore, Hepsin overexpression
in the LNCaP human prostate cancer cell line grown as
an orthotopic xenograft in mice promotes invasive tumor
growth and lymph node metastasis [18].
In this study we report the development of a novel,
non-toxic, and orally bioavailable small molecule Hepsin
inhibitor, HepIn-13. We show that long-term exposure to
HepIn-13 blocks prostate cancer metastasis in a preclinical

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer
in American males [1]. While organ-confined prostate
tumors are usually curable, metastatic prostate cancer is
highly resistant to therapeutic intervention and almost
uniformly fatal. Therefore, the development of effective
novel targeted therapies to inhibit prostate cancer
metastasis could have a considerable impact on prostate
cancer mortality.
Hepsin (HPN) is one of the most upregulated genes
in human prostate cancer and is overexpressed in up to
90% of prostate tumors with levels often increased >10
fold [2-4]. Hepsin increases early in prostate cancer
initiation and its high levels are maintained throughout
progression and metastasis [3-6]. Hepsin belongs to the
protein family of type-II transmembrane cell surface
serine proteases [7, 8]. Hepsin can cleave and activate
pro-uPA, pro-HGF, Laminin332 and pro-MSP [9-11].

have therapeutic potential in other cancers with Hepsin
amplification.
We have previously identified several small
molecule compounds that inhibit the activity of purified
recombinant Hepsin [20]. To develop and analyze
therapeutically-relevant Hepsin inhibitor, we analyzed
all available from ChemBridge derivatives of the lead
compound #4 (Figure 1). In these studies we used
recombinant human Hepsin produced in Drosophila
S2 cells [21] (Figure S2). While the majority of these
compounds either did not show inhibition or inhibited
Hepsin with decreased potency, six compounds (HepIn-1,
HepIn-8, HepIn-13, HepIn-17, HepIn-20 and HepIn-25)
displayed similar or increased potency (Figure 1, A-B).
IC50 values were determined by titration against Hepsin
activity and HepIn-13 was found to be the most potent
inhibitor with an IC50 of 0.33 µM. (Figure 1, B). Similarly
to compound #4, the identified derivatives were specific
for Hepsin, as they showed only minor activity against
Matriptase, a serine protease highly similar to Hepsin
(Figure S3).
Since our Hepsin activity assay utilizes a small
peptide substrate, it was necessary to analyze whether the

RESULTS
Identification of novel small molecule Hepsin
inhibitors
Hepsin is prominently overexpressed in the majority
of human prostate cancers and functional in vivo studies
support a causal role for Hepsin in cancer progression
[12, 18, 19]. Interestingly, while most of the cancer
literature is primarily focused on Hepsin in prostate
cancer, analysis of publically available datasets indicates
that Hepsin is frequently amplified in a variety of human
cancer types, especially in ovarian serous adenocarcinoma
(10%), sarcoma (7.2%), lung adenocarcinoma (5.4%),
lung squamous cell carcinoma (4.5%), adenoid cystic
carcinoma (5%), breast carcinoma (2.6%), as well as
many other cancer types (Figure S1). We hypothesized
that inhibition of Hepsin activity using small molecules
would attenuate prostate cancer progression and may

identified compounds inhibit Hepsin-mediated cleavage of
a protein substrate. It has been previously reported that
Hepsin can cleave and activate pro-HGF [10, 11]. This
Hepsin activity is likely to be important for prostate cancer
progression, because HGF/MET signaling pathway is
strongly implicated in tumor progression and metastasis
in prostate cancer [22]. Thus, we analyzed whether our
compounds can inhibit Hepsin-mediated cleavage of proHGF. We found that both the original lead compound #4
and its six derivatives inhibited Hepsin-mediated cleavage
of pro-HGF (Figure S4, A-B). Therefore, we conclude
that we identified several novel small molecule inhibitors,
which inhibit the in vitro activity of recombinant Hepsin
at sub-micromolar concentrations.

pro-HGF (Figure 2, C). This cleavage was inhibited in the
presence of Hepsin inhibitors (Figure 2, C-C’).

Pharmacokinetics and oral bioavailability of
Hepsin inhibitors
To determine whether the Hepsin inhibitors were
suitable for in vivo use, we analyzed them in mice.
Intravenous injections of escalating amounts of the
compounds did not result in any signs of acute toxicity,
even when injected at the maximal practical dose of a 20
mg/kg.
To determine blood half-life of our compounds,
we injected 1 mg of the compound into the tail vein and
analyzed blood at different time points after injection.
The compounds were extracted from blood plasma and
analyzed by LCMS. To generate a standard curve, we
added known concentrations of the compounds to mouse
blood plasma and then extracted and analyzed them by
LCMS (Figure 3, A). As expected, the blood concentration
of the compounds dropped quickly immediately after the
tail vein injections due to rapid tissue dissemination. The
terminal blood half-life of HepIn-13 was calculated at 55
min, and similar values were obtained for other Hepsin
inhibitors (Figures 3, B and S5).
To analyze the oral bioavailability, we delivered
3 mg of the test compounds by oral gavage and then
analyzed blood for the appearance of the compounds

Inhibition of Cell Surface Hepsin proteolytic
activity
To determine whether the identified compounds
can suppress the activity of full-length Hepsin, when it is
expressed on the surface of live cells, we developed a cellbased Hepsin activity assay. For this purpose, we generated
HEK293 cells overexpressing full-length Hepsin (Figure
2, A). HA-tagged human pro-HGF secreted into serumfree conditioned media from stably transduced HEK293
cells was used as a protein substrate in these experiments
(Figure 2, B). Hepsin overexpressing, but not the control
vector-transduced cells, efficiently cleaved the HA-tagged

compound, HepIn-13, was detectable in blood after oral
gavage (Figures 3, C-D and S6). Thus, we focused our
further studies on HepIn-13.

HepIn-13 (http://www.dockingserver.com/web). The
entire extracellular region of Hepsin was used in these
unsupervised docking experiments. Interestingly, the
best-ranked calculated docking pose demonstrates an
interaction of HepIn-13 with the catalytic pocket of
Hepsin (Figure 4). Moreover, one of the amino acids of
the Hepsin catalytic triad, Ser195 (Ser353 in full-length
Hepsin), is predicted to interact with HepIn-13. Thus, in
silico docking of Hepsin and HepIn-13 places HepIn-13
within the catalytic pocket of Hepsin and predicts an
interactions with one of the amino acids of the Hepsin
catalytic triad.

Molecular modeling of interactions between
Hepsin and HepIn-13
The crystal structure of Hepsin has been previously
determined [23]. We used in silico molecular docking
approaches to model interactions between Hepsin and

significance of Hepsin expression in these mice was
already well established.
Considering the characteristics of the LPB-Tag/
PB-Hepsin model, we anticipated that we would need to
treat animals with HepIn-13 for a relatively long duration,
starting at 10 weeks of age, when the animals present with
low-grade prostate tumors. The most non-invasive longterm delivery of an orally bioavailable small molecule
compound involves mixing the test compound with
animal water or food. Thus, we first analyzed whether we
can detect HepIn-13 in the animal blood, after the mice
are exposed to the soft rodent chow containing varying
concentrations of HepIn-13. With our limit of blood
HepIn-13 detection at 1 µM, we found that exposure
of the animals to rodent chow containing 0.25% of
HepIn-13 resulted in the presence of HepIn-13 in blood at
concentrations that are significantly higher than its IC50
(Figure S7). We also analyzed blood of mice exposed for
5 weeks to the food containing 0.25% of HepIn-13 for
signs of liver toxicity; however, the levels of AST and ALT
were within the normal ranges in these animals indicating

To determine whether HepIn-13 can attenuate or
prevent prostate cancer progression in vivo, we performed
animal studies. For this purpose, we chose to use LPBTag/PB-Hepsin mice, which is the only existing genetic
model of metastatic prostate cancer that expresses Hepsin
and consistently shows bone metastasis, which is prevalent
in human prostate cancer [12]. LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice
upregulate expression of SV40 large T antigen and Hepsin
in the prostate epithelium and develop primary prostate
cancer with metastatic lesions in approximately 55% of
the animals [12]. LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice are derived
from LPB-Tag animals (12T-7f adenocarcinoma line),
which express SV40 large T antigen, but do not express
Hepsin [12, 24]. LPB-Tag mice present with primary
prostate tumors, but do not develop metastasis. Thus, LPBTag/PB-Hepsin model of prostate cancer was ideal for
our analysis of Hepsin inhibitors, because the functional

absence of general liver damage. The animals did not
exhibit signs of distress in this chronic dosing experiment.
Thus, we decided to perform animal trials with HepIn-13
mixed with rodent chow at 0.25% and 0.1%.
For the animal trial, 10 week-old LPB-Tag/PBHepsin males were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups.
One control group was exposed to soft rodent chow alone
(12 mice), while the other two groups were exposed to the
same rodent chow mixed with 0.1% (10 mice) or 0.25%
(11 mice) of HepIn-13. Thirteen weeks later the animals
were euthanized and their prostate glands, livers, lungs
and bones were examined by histological staining and
immunochistochemistry (Figures 5, 6). As expected, the
control animal group presented with metastatic lesions in
66% of the animals, and bone metastasis in 42% of the
animals (Table 1, Figure 6). While cellular proliferation,
apoptotic cell death, blood vessel density (Figures 5,
S8) and the size of the primary prostate tumors were not
significantly changed in the group treated with 0.25% of
Hepln-13 (mean tumor size 1.9±2.0 g in HepIn-13-treated
versus 2.1±3.3 g in control animals), no metastasis was
found in these mice (Table 1). The group exposed to 0.1%
of HepIn-13 displayed intermediate metastasis phenotype
(30% animals with metastasis, 20% bone metastasis).
Overall, we conclude that HepIn-13 displays dosedependent inhibition of Hepsin overexpression-relevant
prostate cancer phenotypes in LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice
and blocks prostate cancer metastasis in this animal model.

DISCUSSION
We show here that HepIn-13 inhibits Hepsin and
blocks prostate cancer metastasis. Importantly, HepIn-13
was able to block metastasis to the bone, which is the
most common site of metastasis in human prostate
cancer. Interestingly, despite the high penetrance of bone
metastasis in human prostate cancer, this has been difficult
to replicate in mouse models. Consistent bone metastasis
was reported in mice with prostate cancer caused by
deletion of PTEN/P53 and the loss and subsequent reactivation of Telomerase [25]; however, subsequent
pathological analysis suggested direct bone invasion
from large primary tumors rather than bona fide bone
metastasis [26]. LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice is a genetic
model of prostate cancer which consistently develops
bone metastasis [12, 26]. We have previously reported
that 20% of 21 week-old LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice
present with femur bone lesions. In this study we used a
different animal feed (soft transgenic dough) and found
that by 23 weeks of age 42% of LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice
present with bone metastasis. All the mice with lesions
in femur bones also displayed lesions in spine, indicating
broad skeletal involvement in affected individuals.
Since spine lesions may be the result of a direct primary
tumor invasion, we believe that the presence of femur
lesions in LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice is more significant,

HepIn-13 (0.25%) in animal food to achieve detectable
levels in blood. Therefore, it appears that the oral
bioavailability of HepIn-13 is relatively poor and
additional modifications will be necessary to enhance
the drug properties without decreasing the potency and
specificity.

because it indicates bona fide bone metastasis. Treatment
of LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice with Hepsin inhibitor
HepIn-13 completely suppressed the development of
bone metastasis, strongly suggesting that Hepsin plays an
important role in the skeletal spread of prostate cancer.
The analysis of HepIn-13 in a single autochthonous
model of prostate cancer is an important limitation of
this study. Additional Hepsin overexpressing models
of prostate cancer will need to be developed to analyze
the efficacy of HepIn-13. We have crossed PB-Hepsin
[12] and Pr-Cre4/PTENfl/fl [27] mice, hypothesizing that
overexpression of Hepsin in PTEN-/- prostate epithelial
cells could promote bone metastasis. However, we found
that the synthetic Probasin (PB) promoter that was used
in the generation of PB-Hepsin mice [28] is inactivated in
PTEN-/- cells in vivo. Therefore, different approach to drive
Hepsin expression will have to be used in the future to
generate new models to analyze the efficacy of HepIn-13
in inhibition of prostate cancer bone metastasis.
While HepIn-13 is the first small molecule Hepsin
inhibitor used in an animal model of prostate cancer, a
protein-based Hepsin inhibitor, Kunitz domain-1, was
previously used in a xenograft model of prostate cancer
[18]. In that model, LnCaP-34 cells displayed a Hepsindependent ability to invade and develop lymph node
metastasis [18]. Treatment of mice carrying LnCaP-34
tumors with Kunitz domain-1 decreased contralateral
prostate invasion (46% weight reduction) and lymph node
metastasis (50% inhibition) [18].
In addition to Kunitz domain-1, development of
several antibodies specifically inhibiting Hepsin have been
reported [13, 29, 30]. While Hepsin antibodies are likely
to be useful for prostate cancer imaging, the therapeutic
use of these antibodies for tumor eradication may be
somewhat limited due to the prominent expression of
endogenous Hepsin in hepatocytes [31]. Hepsin is not an
essential gene and Hepsin knockout mice are viable and
fertile [32, 33]; however, these animals exhibit hearing
loss due to developmental deformities in the cochlea
[34]. Moreover, Hepsin knockout mice display enlarged
hepatocytes and narrowed liver sinusoids [35]. Consistent
with the phenotype of Hepsin knockout mice, we did not
observe any prominent deficiency in mice treated with
Hepsin inhibitors; however, more careful examination will
be necessary in the future.
One of possible limitation of HepIn-13 is its
potential inhibitory effect on other proteases. While
we found that HepIn-13 did not inhibit Matriptase, it is
always possible that HepIn-13 can inhibit other enzymes.
Considering the lack of toxicity associated with longterm HepIn-13 exposure in mice, it appears unlikely that
HepIn-13 inhibited essential enzymes. Therefore, the
potential off-target activity of HepIn-13 is unlikely to pose
a significant problem.
While we found that HepIn-13 was orally
bioavailable, we used relatively high concentration of

METHODS
Reagents
Small molecule compounds were either
purchased from ChemBridge Corporation or were
synthesized (HepIn-13). HepIn-13 was prepared
by heating 1,8-diaminonaphthalene (1 mM) and
4-bromobenzaldehyde (1 mM) overnight in absolute
ethanol. The resulting mixture was concentrated and
the resulting dark brown/purple solid was recrystallized
twice from 95% ethanol to yield a light purple crystalline
solid (64% yield). The product was homogeneous by
HPLC (>95% purity) and had 1H NMR and mass spectra
consistent with the proposed structure. The chromogenic
peptide pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA (s-2366) was purchased
from DiaPharma. Rabbit anti-human Hepsin polyclonal
antibody was purchased from Cayman Chemical
(#100022). Anti-Flag antibody was purchased from
Sigma (F1804). Anti-HA antibody was purchased from
Roche (#1867423). Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody
was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Human
recombinant Matriptase was purchased from R&D
Systems. Molecular biology-grade DMSO was purchased
from Sigma. Purified recombinant human pro-HGF was
obtained from Dr. George F. Vande Woude (Van Andel
Research Institute).

Recombinant Hepsin expression purification and
in vitro activity assays
Extracellular part of human Hepsin (amino acids
45-417) containing the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich
(SRCR) and trypsin-like serine protease domains was
expressed and purified from S2 cells using the Drosophila
Inducible/Secreted Expression System (Invitrogen),
as previously described [36]. The Hepsin Vmax, Km and
Hepsin inhibition were determined using chromogenic
substrate pyroGlu-Pro-Arg-pNA as described [20]. Briefly,
the inhibition assays were performed by incubating the
compounds with Hepsin in the assay buffer (30mM TrisHCl, pH8.4; 30mM imidazole, 200mM NaCl and 1%
DMSO) for 30 minutes at room temperature followed
by addition of the substrate at the observed Km and
incubation for 3h. The endpoint absorbance was measured
using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular Devices).
Residual Hepsin activity was observed relative to DMSO

controls. IC50 was calculated by fitting the data to a fourvariable nonlinear regression using GraphPad Prism5.

For the activity assay, the HEK293-Hepsin cells were
plated in a 24-well plate at 200,000 cells/well. Fortyeight hrs later, cells were rinsed with serum-free media
and cultured for 4 hours in serum-free media with 1%
DMSO or indicated test compounds dissolved in DMSO.
The conditioned serum-free media containing HA-tagged
pro-HGF was added and the cells were cultured for
additional 90 minutes. The resulting extracellular media
was collected and the cleavage of pro-HGF was analyzed
using western blotting with anti-HA antibodies.

Recombinant DNA constructs
For generation of a Doxycycline- regulated Hepsin
expression plasmid, full-length human Hepsin, retaining
the last intron for transcript stabilization, was amplified
by stitching PCR using both cDNA and genomic DNA
templates. The resulting fragment was cloned into EcoRI/
SalI sites of pTRE-Tight (Clontech). For generation of
HA-tagged pro-HGF expression plasmid, mouse cDNA
library was PCR amplified with oligos containing the
restriction enzyme cutting sites and C-terminal HA
sequence. The fragment was cloned into SacI/SalI sites of
pIRES-hrGFP-2a (Stratagene). All DNA constructs were
sequence verified.

In vivo efficacy trial in a genetic animal model of
metastatic prostate cancer
LPB-Tag/PB-Hepsin mice express SV40 large
T antigen and Hepsin transgenes in luminal prostate
epithelium and develop prominent primary prostate cancer
with metastatic lesions in liver, lung, and bone [12]. LPBTag/PB-Hepsin males were generated as F1 in the crossing
of LPB-Tag transgenic females (12T-7f adenocarcinoma
line, CD-1 background) [24] with PB-Hepsin transgenic
males (C57BL/6J background), as described [12].
For the in vivo experiment, the 10-week-old LPBTag/PB-Hepsin males were randomly divided into 3
groups. The control group was exposed to soft Transgenic
Dough Diet (Bio-Serv, S3472) with 10% of powdered
rodent chow and two experimental groups were exposed
to the same food mixed with either 0.1% or 0.25% of the
compound HepIn-13. After 13 weeks of exposure, the
animals were euthanized and their prostates, livers, lungs,
and spine and femur bones were analyzed.

Cell lines and cell culture
LNCaP, CHO, PC3 and HEK293FT cells were
obtained from ATCC. LNCaP and PC3 cells were
maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS
and penicillin/streptomycin. HEK293FT cells were
maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS,
nonessential amino acids and penicillin/streptomycin.
CHO cells were grown in F-12 media supplemented
with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. Drosophila
S2 cells expressing inducible secreted extracellular part
of human Hepsin were grown in Schneider’s medium
(Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, and
penicillin/streptomycin [21]. TET-OFF HEK293 cells
were purchased from Clontech (C3008-1). For generation
of a cell line expressing full-length human Hepsin
(HEK293-Hepsin), TET-OFF HEK293 cells were stably
transduced with a mixture of pTRE-Tight-hHepsin and
pBabe and stable clones were selected with puromycin.
For generation of a cell line expressing secreted HAtagged full-length mouse pro-HGF (HEK293-pro-HGFHA), HEK293 cells were stably transduced with a mixture
of pIRES-hrGFP-2a (Stratagene) and pBabe and stable
clones were selected with puromycin.

Determination of compound pharmacokinetics in
mice
CD-1 mice (Charles River) were used in general
pharmacokinetics experiments. All experiments involving
mice were conducted in compliance with Fred Hutchinson
Cancer Research Center Committees on Use and Care
of Animals guidelines. The indicated compounds were
solubilized in 1:1 Ethanol:Cremophore EL (Merck)
mixture and diluted with 9 volumes of PBS. To determine
the highest dose resulting in acute toxicity, escalating
doses of the compounds were injected into the tail vein
of adult mice and animals were monitored for 2 days. No
signs of acute toxicity were observed in these experiments
for all investigated compounds injected at the maximum
practical dose of 20mg/kg. To determine the blood halflife, 1 mg of the indicated compound was injected into
the tail vein of adult mice and the blood was collected
at different time points after injection. The compounds
were extracted from blood plasma with ethyl acetate,
air dried, resuspended in Acetonitrile and analyzed by
HPLC (Agilent Technologies, ACE 3 C8-300, 150 x
3.0mm, ACE-212-1503, A 72063). The HPLC peaks

Cell-based Hepsin activity assay
HEK293 cells stably transduced with full-length
human Hepsin were used in cell-based Hepsin activity
assays. To obtain HA-tagged pro-HGF substrate, HEK293
cells stably transduced with HA-tagged pro-HGF were
washed with PBS and incubated in serum-free media for 8
hours. The conditioned media containing HA-tagged proHGF was collected, filtered through 0.2 µm surfactantfree cellulose acetate filter, concentrated by ultrafiltration
(Amicon Ultra, Millipore) and kept in aliquots at -80˚C.

were subsequently analyzed using Mass Spectrometry
(LTQ-OrbiTrap, Agilent). To test oral bioavailability,
3 mg of the indicated compound was delivered by oral
gavage and blood was drawn at different time points
after the treatment and analyzed for the presence of the
compounds as described above. Similar approach was
used to test for the presence of the indicated compounds
in blood of the animals exposed to Transgenic Dough Diet
(Bio-Serv, S3472) with 10% powdered rodent chow and
0.1% or 0.25% of the test compound. Levels of Aspartate
transaminase and Alanine aminotransferase (AST and
ALT) in blood were measured by Phoenix Central
Laboratory (Mukilteo, WA).

crystal structure of extracellular region of human Hepsin
[23] and 3-dimentional structure of HepIn-13 were
used in these experiments. Docking calculations were
then performed by using AutoDock 4 [38] integrated
in DockingServer. Docking simulations were carried
out by using the Lamarckian Genetic Algorithm. The
initial position, orientation, and torsions of the inhibitor
molecules were set randomly, and all rotatable torsions
were released during docking. Each docking experiment
was derived from 100 different runs that were set to
terminate after a maximum of 2500000 energy evaluations.
The conformer with the lowest docking energy calculated
with AutoDock 4 scoring function was selected as the final
binding conformation.

Western blotting

Statistical Analysis

Total prostate protein lysates were generated by
manual grinding of frozen in liquid nitrogen prostates
using prechilled on dry ice Mortar and Pestle. The
resulting frozen powder was extracted with the protein
lysis buffer containing: 1xPBS, 1% SDS, 1% NP40, 2%
Tween 20, and 1.5 M Urea. The proteins were separated on
4-12% NuPAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membrane
using the iBlot system (Invitrogen). The membrane was
blocked in TBST buffer containing: 5% non-fat milk,
2% normal goat serum in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100
mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 and incubated overnight at
+4˚C in the same buffer containing anti-Hepsin (Cayman,
1:1000), anti-HA (Roche, 1:1000) or anti--actin (Sigma
A5441, 1:20,000), antibodies. The relevant HRP-labeled
secondary antibodies (1:5000) were purchased from
Jackson ImmunoReserch Laboratories and the blots were
developed using ECL (Pierce). Expression levels were
quantified by densitometry using ImageQuantTL.

For all graphs, data presented are mean value ±
SD. Statistics were calculated using GraphPad Prism 6.
Statistical significance was determined by the unpaired
Student’s t test, the two-tailed Fisher’s exact test (for
comparison of incidence of metastasis) and Mann–
Whitney test (for comparison of tumor size). P value is
indicated by asterisk(s) in the figures. *, denotes P<0.05;
**, P<0.01. Differences at P<0.05 and lower were
considered statistically significant.
