Abstract
Multiple myeloma is a fatal plasma cell neoplasm accounting
for over 10,000 deaths in the United States each year. Despite new
therapies, multiple myeloma remains incurable, and patients
ultimately develop drug resistance and succumb to the disease.
The response to selective CDK4/6 inhibitors has been modest in
multiple myeloma, potentially because of incomplete targeting of
other critical myeloma oncogenic kinases. As a substantial number of multiple myeloma cell lines and primary samples were
found to express AMPK-related protein kinase 5(ARK5), a member of the AMPK family associated with tumor growth and
invasion, we examined whether dual inhibition of CDK4 and
ARK5 kinases using ON123300 results in a better therapeutic
outcome. Treatment of multiple myeloma cell lines and primary
samples with ON123300 in vitro resulted in rapid induction of

cell-cycle arrest followed by apoptosis. ON123300-mediated
ARK5 inhibition or ARK5-speciﬁc siRNAs resulted in the inhibition of the mTOR/S6K pathway and upregulation of the AMPK
kinase cascade. AMPK upregulation resulted in increased SIRT1
levels and destabilization of steady-state MYC protein. Furthermore, ON123300 was very effective in inhibiting tumor growth in
mouse xenograft assays. In addition, multiple myeloma cells
sensitive to ON123300 were found to have a unique genomic
signature that can guide the clinical development of ON123300.
Our study provides preclinical evidence that ON123300 is unique
in simultaneously inhibiting key oncogenic pathways in multiple
myeloma and supports further development of ARK5 inhibition
as a therapeutic approach in multiple myeloma. Cancer Res; 76(5);

Introduction

To address these challenges, we recently described the development of ON123300 (8, 9), a second-generation, orally bioavailable
CDK inhibitor that potently inhibits CDK4 as well as AMPK-related
protein kinase 5 (ARK5). ARK5 (also known as NUAK1) is a member of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) catalytic subunit
family and functions as a key regulator of cellular energy homeostasis (10). ARK5 expression is associated with increased tumor cell
invasiveness in multiple myeloma, transcriptionally regulated by
multiple myeloma oncogenes such as MMSET, c-MAF, and MAFB
(11), and is also directly activated by Akt, thereby regulating Aktdependent cell survival and migration activity (12, 13).
In this study, we sought to determine whether selective inhibition of ARK5 and CDK4 could be an effective way to target
cellular proliferation in multiple myeloma. Our ﬁndings demonstrate speciﬁc and potent antimyeloma activity of ON123300,
a dual ARK5/CDK4 inhibitor, and that ARK5 inhibition is lethal
in multiple myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo while sparing
normal healthy B cells. Our study also suggests a novel function
for ARK5 in bridging the mTOR/Rb/MYC pathways. In summary,
our study has revealed a new regulatory mechanism for controlling multiple myeloma with immediate translational relevance
using small-molecule inhibitors of ARK5.

Multiple myeloma is a malignancy characterized by uncontrolled proliferation of clonal plasma cells with an incidence of
about 20,000 per year in the United States (1, 2). The major
clinical presentations of the disease include hypercalcemia, renal
failure, anemia, and lytic bone destruction (3). Despite recent
advances in new therapies for multiple myeloma, this disease
remains incurable with a median overall survival of 7 to 8 years
(4). The pursuit for drugs that inhibit cyclin-dependent kinases
(CDK) has been an intense area of research (5). Despite cell-cycle
dysregulation being prominent in myeloma pathogenesis, efﬁcacy of CDK inhibitors as single agents has been modest (6, 7).
Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new myeloma targets
for drug development.

RPMI1640 medium (CellGro) supplemented with 10% FBS
(Gemini Bio Products), N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N0 -2-ethanesulfonic acid, 100 U/mL penicillin G, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (CellGro). ON123300 and PD-0332991 compounds
were supplied by Dr. M.V. Reddy (Icahn School of Medicine,
Mount Sinai, New York, NY). SRT1720 (cat# S1129) was purchased from Selleck Chemicals. All drugs were stored between
4 C and 20 C. Cells were treated in series of eight 100 mL wells
for 48 hours for viability assessment and in 3 mL wells in triplicate, for 24 to 48 hours, to determine protein amounts. All cells
were propagated in standard cell culture conditions (5% CO2,
37 C) in cell culture–treated T75/T150 ﬂasks (Falcon). Once
cells had reached 80% conﬂuency, cells were replated in T75
ﬂasks. After 10 to 12 passages, cells were discarded. All cell lines
were authenticated and tested negative for mycoplasma.
Cell viability assay
Cell viability was determined by a ﬂuorometric resazurin
reduction method (CellTiter-Blue; Promega) according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The number of viable cells in
each treated well was calculated 48 hours after treatment. Cells
(100 mL; 105 cells per well) were plated in 96-well plates
(8 replicates per condition), with 20 mL of CellTiter-Blue
Reagent added to each well. After 1 hour of incubation with
the dye, ﬂuorescence (560Ex/590Em) was measured with the
FLUOstar Microplate Reader (BMG LABTECH). The number of
viable cells in each treated well was calculated based on the
linear least-squares regression of the standard curve. Cell viability in drug-treated cells was normalized to their respective
untreated controls. Cell counts were conﬁrmed on the Countess
Automated Cell Counter (Life Technologies).
Primary multiple myeloma cells and BMSCs
All studies involving human samples were performed under
Mount Sinai Hospital (New York, NY) Institutional Review
Board committee–approved protocols, through which informed
consent was obtained, and deidentiﬁed samples were utilized.
Mononuclear cells were isolated from aspirates as detailed in the
Miltenyi MidiMACS bone marrow mononuclear cell protocol.
Mononuclear cells isolated from multiple myeloma patient
bone marrow aspirates were positively sorted using anti-CD138
magnetic microbeads and the MidiMACS cell sorting system
following manufacturer's protocol (Miltenyi Biotec) to >95%
purity as determined by anti-CD138-PE staining and FACS
analysis and cultured in 37 C/5% CO2 incubators in RPMI1640
medium. Human HS-5 bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC;
ATCC CRL-11882) were obtained from ATCC. These cells were
cultured in RPMI1640 medium containing 20% FBS. A total of
30,000 HS5 BMSCs per well were plated in 6-well dishes and
allowed to form an adherent monolayer for more than 48 hours.
A total of 90,000 multiple myeloma cells (MM1.S and NCIH929 cells) were plated over the monolayer. The BMSC monolayer remained undisturbed.
Apoptosis and cell-cycle analysis
MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were treated with ON123300/PD0332991 for 24 hours. Approximately 106 cells of each cell line
were harvested (along with untreated controls) after 24 hours of
treatment in 12-well plates. Cells were washed with PBS and
resuspended in appropriate volume of Annexin binding buffer

1226 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

and then stained with Annexin V Paciﬁc Blue/PI (BD Biosciences;
Clontech), followed by quantiﬁcation of apoptotic cells using
FACSFortessa (BD Biosciences). Cell cycle was analyzed by
using Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit,
and cell-cycle distribution was assessed with FACSFortessa.
Transient transfection
For transfections, two Stealth siRNAs against human ARK5
(#1:50 -GAAGTTATGCTTTATTCAC-30 ;#2:50 -CATCCTCTGATTCTAGGTG-30 ) and a scrambled siRNA were synthesized by Life
Technologies. Individual ON-TARGETplus SIRT1 siRNAs (#J003540-09 and J-003540-10) were purchased from GE Dharmacon. MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were transiently transfected
with ARK5 siRNA and scrambled nontargeting siRNA using the
cell line 4D Nucleofector Solution SG program EO100 (Amaxa
Biosystems). Cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection,
followed by analysis using immunoblotting, apoptosis, and cell
viability assay.
Western blot analysis
Cells were lysed in modiﬁed RIPA buffer containing 50 mmol/L
Tris-HCl (pH, 8), 300 mmol/L NaCl, 10% NP-40, 1% sodium
deoxycholate, and 0.1% SDS and a protease inhibitor cocktail
tablet (Roche Applied Science). Protein extracts, approximately
30 mg of each sample, were resolved by SDS-PAGE followed by
immunoblotting with ARK5 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology
#4458), total MYC (Cell Signaling Technology #9402), acetyl
MYC lysine 323 (Millipore #ABE26), SIRT1 (Cell Signaling Technology # 2310), AMPK (Cell Signaling Technology #2532), total
Rb (Santa Cruz Biotechnology #sc-74562), phosphoRb (Cell
Signaling Technology #9308), total S6K (Cell Signaling Technology #9202), phosphoS6K (Cell Signaling Technology #9205),
and actin antibody (C-11, horseradish peroxidase, goat polyclonal antibody; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and detected by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). After treatment,
cells were harvested and washed with ice-cold PBS and subsequently lysed with RIPA buffer with fresh protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Blot patterns were analyzed using ImageJ software
(http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/), providing a quantitative measure of
protein expression.
RNA sequencing and data analysis
Total RNA was isolated using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Life
Technologies). We extracted poly A–selected RNA from CD138þ
-selected primary multiple myeloma cells and NCI-H929 cell line.
In total, 100 ng of total RNA input was used to construct RNASeq
libraries using TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina)
following the manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was done
on a HiSeq 2500 System using 100 bases and paired-end read
sequencing for primary cells and two samples of ARK5 siRNA
experiment with NCI-H929 cells. The data discussed in this article
have been deposited in the sequence read archive of NCBI with
study accession number SRP051819. The reads with quality Phred
scores more than 30 were aligned to reference sequence database
(UCSC hg19), as well as RefSeq exons, splicing junctions, and
contamination databases, including ribosome and mitochondria
sequences using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner. To compare the
expression levels, the read counts of transcripts in each sample
were normalized by leveling the total read count in each sample to
the maximum of the read counts in all samples. The differentially

expressed transcripts were identiﬁed using LIMMA package in
Bioconductor (14). Subsequent analysis of gene expression data
was done in the freely available statistical computing language R
(www.r-project.org) with packages available from the Bioconductor project (www.bioconductor.org). Further pathway analysis
was carried out using MetaCore of GeneGo, Inc. MetaCore
analyzes experimental high-throughput data in the context of
pathways and networks that are ideal for data mining. This
pathway analysis tool was used to obtain curated molecular
interactions related to the differentially regulated genes. Gene set
enrichment analysis (GSEA, version 2.0.14) was performed
with the C6 oncogenic signature gene sets from the MSigDB
version 4.0 (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb; ref.
15) with pre-ranked genes (selected based on log-fold change
and adjusted P < 0.05) that were differentially expressed between
NCI-H929 ARK5 siRNA-depleted and control cells.
Statistical analysis
Comparisons of means between control and experimental
groups were by Student t test. A P value of less than 0.05 was
considered to indicate statistical signiﬁcance, and all tests were
two-tailed. All in vitro experiments were performed in triplicate
and repeated at least three times. Results were expressed as mean
þ SE of the untransformed data. All the analyses were performed
with packages in R unless otherwise speciﬁed.
In vivo tumor models
All animal studies were carried out in accordance with the
guidelines of the Institute for Animal Studies at Mount Sinai (New
York, NY). Two million of MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were mixed
with 50% Matrigel (BD Biosciences) and injected subcutaneously
into the right ﬂank of 4- to 5-week-old NSG female mice (Taconic). When the tumors approached 0.5 to 0.7 cm in diameter at
approximately 10 to 14 days after injection of cancer cells, the
mice were divided into 2 groups: (i) ON123300 group, which
received a dose of 100 mg/kg i.p. every alternate day and (ii)
control untreated group, which received saline every alternate day.
Tumor volume and weight were assessed every 2 days. Tumor
volumes were calculated using the following equation: (4/3)
[(LþW)/4]3. The data were expressed as average tumor volume
(mm3) per group as a function of time. Animals were sacriﬁced
when tumor diameter exceeded 1 cm or after loss of greater than
10% body weight in accordance with the institutional guidelines.

Results
ON123300 is a multitargeted kinase inhibitor with potent
in vitro activity against multiple myeloma cells
Our own efforts in anticancer drug discovery led to the development of ON123300 (Fig. 1A; Supplementary Table S1), a
multitargeted kinase inhibitor with potent inhibitory activity
against ARK5 and CDK4 (9). Our earlier studies using ON123300
in breast, glioma, and mantle cell lymphoma models had shown
potent inhibition of these kinases in vitro and in vivo (9, 16, 17).
Prior studies have also described that ARK5 is expressed in an
MAF-dependent manner in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma
patients (11). ARK5 expression in primary myelomas expressing
c-MAF and MAFB suggested that ARK5 may be a transcriptional
target of the large MAF family and that ARK5 might be involved in
multiple myeloma pathogenesis. In addition, as a recent study
(10) showed that ARK5 overexpression is required to prevent

www.aacrjournals.org

proapoptotic effects of MYC overexpression in tumor cells, we
examined whether ARK5 could serve as a potential therapeutic
target in multiple myeloma. To address this hypothesis, we
evaluated the antiproliferative effect of the ARK5/CDK4 inhibitor
ON123300 against a panel of multiple myeloma cell lines and
primary multiple myeloma cells. Initially, we evaluated the levels
of ARK5 in multiple myeloma by Western blot analysis. We
examined 8 multiple myeloma cell lines and 3 primary samples
from relapsed multiple myeloma patients for the expression of
ARK5 protein levels. ARK5 was found to be overexpressed in all
primary samples as well as 7 of the multiple myeloma cell lines
with the exception of RPMI 8226 (Fig. 1B). ON123300 decreased
cell viability by approximately 60% to 80% at a concentration
of 50 nmol/L in 4 of 8 multiple myeloma cell lines (Fig. 1C).
Similarly 4 of 6 primary multiple myeloma cells were sensitive to
treatment with ON123300 at the same concentration (Fig. 1D).
Normal peripheral blood cells were spared from the effects of
this compound, conﬁrming a potent and speciﬁc anti–multiple
myeloma effect of ON123300.
ON123300 induces apoptosis, cell-cycle arrest, and negatively
regulates mTOR/MYC pathways in multiple myeloma cells
To further understand the mechanism of action underlying
ON123300-induced multiple myeloma cell death, MM1.S and
NCI-H929 cells were treated with ON123300 (5 nmol/L, 10
nmol/L, and 50 nmol/L) for 24 hours and then stained with
Annexin V/PI and subjected to ﬂow cytometric analysis. ON123300
induced a signiﬁcant increase in both early and late apoptotic cell
populations (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S1). In contrast, the
highly selective CDK4/6 inhibitor PD-0332991 (7, 18) that is
currently in clinical trials showed no clear evidence of activation
of apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells (Supplementary Fig. S2).
In PD-0332991 treated MM1.S cells, the majority of cells were
arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and in NCI-H929 cells, no
signiﬁcant changes were observed in response to PD-0332991
treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). ON123300 induced a significant G1–S arrest in both cell lines treated as determined by
5-ethynyl-20 -deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assay (Fig. 2B
and Supplementary Fig. S4). Together, these data indicate that
ON123300 inhibits an antiapoptotic program in multiple myeloma cells and that inactivation of CDK4 and ARK5 by ON123300
might lead to a rapid induction of apoptosis as compared with
PD-0332991 in both MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells.
As ON123300 is a CDK4 inhibitor, we evaluated its effect on
the Rb and mTOR pathways in ON123300-treated multiple
myeloma. MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were treated at 3 different
time points (4, 6, and 12 hours treated with 50 nmol/L concentration of the compound) and showed decreased levels of phosphoRb as well as phosphoS6K as compared with untreated
control cells (Fig. 2C). Although PD-0332991 showed a similar
level of phosphoRb inhibition when MM1.S and NCI-H929 cell
lines were treated for similar time points at two different concentrations of 250 nmol/L and 1 mmol/L (Supplementary Fig. S5),
there was no signiﬁcant change in the phosphoS6K levels when
treated with PD-0332991. These results suggest that ON123300
regulates the expression of phosphoRb and phosphoS6K via the
Rb/mTOR signaling pathways. Similarly, we examined the expression of proteins downstream of mTOR such as MYC for any
signiﬁcant changes in response to ON123300. Western blot
analyses of MYC in MM1.S and NCI-H929 cell lines showed a
signiﬁcant decrease of MYC levels in both the cell lines (Fig. 2C).

decreased cell viability by
approximately 30% to 70% (IC50,
50–200 nmol/L) in 8/8 multiple
myeloma cell lines examined. On the
basis of IC50 of 50 nmol/L, we could
separate the cell lines into two groups:
four cell lines (MM.1R, KMS11, RPMI8226, and ARP1) had IC50 of 50–150
nmol/L, and four cell lines (MM1.S, EJM,
JJN3, and NCI-H929) were very
sensitive (IC50 < 50 nmol/L). D,

puriﬁed CD138 patient multiple
myeloma cells from six patients were
treated with ON123300 at
50 nmol/L concentration for 48 hours,
followed by assessment of viability
using CellTiter-Blue assay. PBMCs
from healthy donors treated with
ON123300 for 48 hours showed no
change in the cell viability, whereas
there was a signiﬁcant decrease in cell
viability in primary multiple myeloma
cells and in both cell lines.

Our Western blot analysis of cell lysates from ON123300
treated multiple myeloma cells showed a strong upregulation of
AMPK (Fig. 2C), another member of the AMP protein kinase
cascade that plays a key role in energy homoeostasis (19). As
AMPK has been shown to regulate the activity of SIRT1, a NADdependent class III histone deacetylase (20), we next investigated
whether the increase in AMPK levels upon ON123300 treatment
resulted in an induction of SIRT1 protein levels. Our results
(Fig. 2C) show that the treatment of multiple myeloma cell lines
with ON123300 results in increased levels of SIRT1 protein. As
SIRT1 has been shown to decrease the MYC protein levels (21),
we next examined whether increased SIRT1 levels seen in
ON123300-treated cells resulted in the deacetylation of MYC
and decreased MYC stability. The results shown in Fig. 2C suggest

1228 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

that ARK5 inhibition (through increased levels of AMPK) indeed
results in the activation of SIRT1, leading to a reduction in MYC
protein levels. These results strongly imply that AMPK is an
important positive regulator of SIRT1 in multiple myeloma cells
and support the relevance of AMPK/SIRT1 as a conserved signaling axis that is activated upon ON123300 treatment.
ARK5 depletion using siRNAs results in inhibition of
Rb/mTOR/MYC pathways and induction of apoptosis and
cell-cycle arrest
As ON123300 is a multikinase inhibitor, we wanted to verify
that the effects described above are due to inhibition of ARK5
kinase activity and whether knockdown of ARK5 by siRNAs
phenocopies the effects seen with ON123300. Depletion of

Dual ARK5 and CDK4 inhibitor ON123300 potently induces

NCI-H929 cells were treated with ON123300 at three different
concentrations (5 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L, and 50 nmol/L) for
24 hours, followed by analysis for apoptosis with Annexin V/PI
double staining. ON123300 triggered a signiﬁcant increase
in both early (Annexin Vþ/PI) and late (Annexin Vþ/PI)
apoptotic cell populations in both cell lines (mean  SD; n ¼ 3).
B, MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were treated with ON123300
(10 nmol/L and 50 nmol/L) for 24 hours, followed by analysis
for cell proliferation by EdU incorporation assay with APC/PI
double staining. Quantiﬁcation of cell-incorporated (EdU)
and total DNA content in control- and ON123300-treated cells
showed a signiﬁcant G0–G1 cell-cycle arrest in treated cells. C,
MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were treated with ON123300
(50 nmol/L) for 4, 6, and 12 hours, followed by Western blot
analysis. As seen, treatment with ON123300 increased the
expression of AMPK and SIRT1, resulting in decreased
acetylation of MYC and total MYC. Alternatively, ON123300
also inhibits Rb/mTOR pathway via reduction in phosphoRb
and phosphoS6K in both cell lines.

ARK5 expression in the MM1.S and NCI-H929 multiple
myeloma cell lines using two different siRNAs resulted in a
signiﬁcant inhibition of cell viability, whereas treatment of cells
with scrambled siRNA had a minimal effect (Supplementary

Fig. S6). ARK5 siRNA–transfected cells also exhibited reductions
in the levels of phosphoRb and phosphoS6K compared with
control cells transfected with scrambled siRNA (Fig. 3A). These
data suggest that ARK5 depletion signiﬁcantly downregulates

transfection in MM1.S and NCI-H929 siRNA–transfected cells. There was no difference in total Rb and total S6K between the groups. B and C, MM1.S and NCIH929 cells were subjected to SIRT1 depletion by siRNA and SIRT1 activation with SRT1720. Western blotting conﬁrmed that depletion of SIRT1 increased
the acetylation activities of MYC, whereas the activation with SRT1720 resulted in decreased acetylation of MYC in a dose- and time-dependent
manner. D, transfection in MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells induced apoptosis in ARK5-depleted cells as compared with nontransfected cells after 24-hour
transfection conﬁrmed with Annexin V/PI double staining. E, transfection in MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells also induced cell-cycle arrest in ARK5-depleted
cells conﬁrmed by EdU cell proliferation assay. Forty percent of MM1.S cells transfected with scrambled control siRNA showed EdU incorporation. EdU
incorporation in cells transfected with ARK5 siRNA was approximately half that of the negative control. In NCI-H929 cells, 50% of cells transfected with
negative control siRNA showed EdU incorporation, and EdU incorporation in cells transfected with ARK5 siRNA was less than half that.

expression of phosphoRb and phosphoS6K via Rb and mTOR
signaling pathways.
In addition, ARK5-depleted cells showed a strong upregulation of AMPK in multiple myeloma cells (Fig. 3A), accompanied by increased levels of SIRT1 protein and a reduction in
MYC protein levels. In addition, treatment of multiple myeloma cells with two different siRNAs directed against SIRT1
resulted in an overall increase in MYC acetylation and stabilization of the protein (Fig. 3B and C). The effect of SIRT1 on
MYC described above raised the possibility that SIRT1 might
negatively regulate the proliferation of multiple myeloma cells.
To test this theory, we treated MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells with a
small molecule agonist of SIRT1, SRT1720. Accordingly, treatment of multiple myeloma cells with SRT1720 signiﬁcantly
decreased cell viability of multiple myeloma cells as observed
previously in another study (Supplementary Fig. S7; ref. 22). In
addition, treatment of cells with SRT1720 led to increased
SIRT1 expression, decreased acetylation of MYC, and reduced
MYC stability (Fig. 3B and C). Taken together, our results
provide mechanistic evidence that SIRT1 is downstream of
ARK5 and that elevated expression of ARK5 in multiple myeloma cell lines correlated with decreased SIRT1 protein levels,
suggesting a potential role for ARK5 in the regulation of MYC
levels by suppressing SIRT1 expression.
To conﬁrm that the decrease in cell number and viability is
associated with apoptosis, we subjected ARK5-depleted MM1.S
and NCI-H929 ARK5 cells to Annexin V/PI staining followed by
ﬂow cytometric analysis. There was a signiﬁcant increase in the
fraction of Annexin V–positive cells in ARK5 siRNA–treated cells
compared with controls, consistent with the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S8). The Rb tumor
suppressor gene plays a major role in regulating the G1–S transition (23). Because ARK5 depletion suppressed cell growth, we
next examined cellular incorporation of EdU using ﬂow cytometry. Both ARK5 siRNA–transfected cell lines showed reduced
levels of EdU incorporation that were approximately 50% of
that of the scrambled control (Fig. 3E). Flow cytometric analysis
also revealed that ARK5-depleted multiple myeloma cells underwent G1 arrest as evidenced by an increased frequency of cells in
the G1 phase and a concomitant decrease of S-phase cells (Fig. 3E
and Supplementary Fig. S9). Taken together, these results indicated that ARK5 depletion induces cell-cycle arrest in the G1–S
phase followed by induction of apoptosis.
ON123300 overcomes bone marrow stromal protection
The bone marrow microenvironment is essential in multiple
myeloma disease progression and drug resistance (24). To
determine whether ON123300 can overcome the protective
effects of the microenvironment and induce cytotoxicity in
multiple myeloma cells in vitro, myeloma cells were grown in
the presence of BMSCs. Although the BMSCs themselves did
not show sensitivity in response to a range of ON123300
concentrations, the myeloma cell lines remained highly sensitive to ON123300 in the presence or absence of BMSCs as
conﬁrmed by Annexin V/PI staining (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S10). As a control, MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were
treated with proteasome inhibitor bortezomib in varying concentrations in the presence or absence of BMSCs for 48 hours,
and the level of cytotoxicity was determined using a cell
viability assay. In contrast to the results obtained with
ON123300, bortezomib-treated MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells

www.aacrjournals.org

displayed higher levels of viability in the presence of stromal
cells, conﬁrming that the percentage of bortezomib-induced
cytotoxicity in stroma context was signiﬁcantly lower than that
in stroma-free conditions (Fig. 4B). This result is consistent
with previous studies suggesting that BMSCs induce resistance
against cytotoxic and apoptotic effects of bortezomib in multiple myeloma cells (25). Therefore, our results suggest that
ON123300 not only directly targets multiple myeloma cells but
also overcomes the cytoprotective effects of the multiple myeloma–host bone marrow microenvironment.
Transcriptomic proﬁling reveals ARK5 depletion results in the
suppression of cell-cycle regulating genes in multiple myeloma
cell lines
Transcriptomic sequencing analysis of NCI-H929 cells transfected with ARK5 and scrambled siRNAs identiﬁed 894 differentially expressed genes (DEG) and their associated enriched
pathways (Supplementary Table S2). Key cell-cycle regulators
such as MYC, cyclins D1, E, and CDK4 were signiﬁcantly suppressed as a function of ARK5 depletion (Fig. 5A). GSEA (15)
with a rank ordered list of these 894 DEGs was performed to
determine enrichment scores and signiﬁcance values across
the MSigDB (C6 oncogenic signatures) gene sets (15). Cellcycle–regulating genes were signiﬁcantly repressed following
ARK5 depletion (Fig. 5B), further supporting our observations
described above. As shown in the schematic (Fig. 5C), our results are consistent with a model whereby ARK5 is upstream of
the AMPK-SIRT1 and Rb/mTOR/MYC pathways.
Transcriptomic proﬁling reveals cell-cycle–regulating genes are
highly enriched in ON123300-sensitive multiple myeloma cell
lines
Using RNA sequencing data from 8 multiple myeloma cell
lines (see Fig. 1B), we identiﬁed gene signatures associated with
ON123300 sensitivity. By using LIMMA (14), a total of 180 genes
were differentially expressed in cell lines (Fig. 6A) with FDR <
0.05 and log2 ratio  2 between the ON123300-sensitive and
-resistant cell lines. We next assessed whether certain biologic
pathways and mechanisms featured more prominently according
to the DEG. Biologic interpretation of these 180 DEGs was
further annotated by GeneGo pathway analysis. Key cell-cycle
regulators cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4, CDC25A, and RelA were
signiﬁcantly upregulated in the ON123300-sensitive cells (Fig.
6B). The most signiﬁcantly top 10 enriched pathways for these
upregulated genes are shown in Supplementary Table S3. Cellcycle arrest inducing genes CDKN2A, CDKN1C and, p14ARF1
and apoptosis inducing genes APAF1, FADD, and caspase-9 were
seen downregulated in the ON123300-sensitive cells (Fig. 6C).
The most signiﬁcantly top 10 enriched pathways for these downregulated genes are shown in Supplementary Table S4. Taken
together, the gene signatures from multiple myeloma cell lines
identiﬁed several cell cycle and apoptosis-related pathways as
relevant to ON123300 sensitivity.
ON123300 inhibits multiple myeloma cell growth in vivo in

We next examined the in vivo efﬁcacy of ON123300 using
mouse xenograft models. MM1.S and NCI-H929 cells were subcutaneously implanted into NSG female mice at 4 to 5 weeks of
age. ON123300 (100 mg/kg) was administered on alternate days

tumor–bearing mice with ON123300 signiﬁcantly decreased the
growth of tumors as opposed to control-treated mice (Fig. 7A
and B) and was well tolerated, with no signiﬁcant weight loss
(Supplementary Fig. S11). These data show potent in vivo activity
of ON123300 against multiple myeloma cells.

Discussion
In this communication, we have examined the effects of
ON123300, a dual inhibitor of CDK4/6 and ARK5 kinases on
the proliferation and survival of multiple myelomas. It is now
well established that a large percentage of multiple myelomas
over express cyclin D1 (CCND1), but this alone is insufﬁcient
to drive the cell cycle (26, 27). Because overexpression of
CCND1 was found to result in high levels of CDK4/6 kinase
activity, inhibition of CDK4/6 is an emerging therapeutic

1232 Cancer Res; 76(5) March 1, 2016

approach for multiple myelomas (28). Numerous CDK inhibitors with differing mechanistic proﬁles are currently being
preclinically and clinically evaluated but have not as of yet
resulted in a drug approval mainly because of lack of selectivity
and high toxicity (29, 30). To explain the modest activity for
the current class of CDK4/6 inhibitors, we hypothesized that
this could be due to the narrow kinase inhibition proﬁle of
CDK4/6 inhibitors, such as PD-0332991, and incomplete targeting of additional myeloma-speciﬁc oncokinases may result
in cytostatic rather than cytotoxic effects.
ARK5, a ﬁfth member of the AMPK family has been identiﬁed
as a transcriptional target of the large MAF family in multiple
myeloma (11). In addition, a recent study (10) showed that
ARK5 overexpression is required to prevent proapoptotic effects
of MYC overexpression in tumor cells, suggesting that this
kinase might play a critical role in multiple myeloma pathogenesis. The development of ON123300, a potent inhibitor of

Therapeutic Targeting in Multiple Myeloma

Figure 5.
Transcriptomic proﬁling reveals ARK5 depletion
results in the suppression of cell cycle regulating
genes in multiple myeloma cell lines. A, RNA
sequencing data from ARK5-depleted NCI-H929
cells identiﬁed 894 DEGs between ARK5 siRNA
and scrambled siRNA. Cell-cycle pathway was
enriched in ARK5-depleted cells with cell-cycle
regulators like MYC, cyclin D and E, and CDK4
genes signiﬁcantly repressed after ARK5
depletion as shown. B, enrichment score plot by
GSEA showed a strong negative enrichment of
MYC target genes in ARK5 depleted NCI-H929
cells. Preranked list of 894 DEGs was used for
GSEA in the C6 oncogenic signatures. The
distribution of MYC target genes (black lines) is
presented as a function of the change in
expression between ARK5 siRNA and scrambled
siRNA, from highly upregulated (red) to highly
downregulated (blue). Normalized enrichment
score (NES) and FDR q values for MYC target
gene set are shown. C, schematic representing
the downstream signaling events of ARK5 is
shown.

ARK5 allowed us to test the effects of ARK5 inhibition on the
growth and survival potential of multiple myeloma cell lines
and primary cells derived from patients who are refractory to
bortezomib, both of which appear to express high levels of
ARK5. Our results show that treatment of ARK5 overexpressing
multiple myelomas with ON123300 results in cell-cycle arrest
and apoptotic death of multiple myeloma cells. Interestingly,
we observed that treatment of multiple myelomas with this
compound results in the upregulation of AMPK and SIRT1
proteins, leading to increased acetylation and degradation of
MYC protein. As ON123300 inhibits multiple kinases, we
examined whether ARK5-speciﬁc siRNAs can phenocopy the
effect of ON123300 seen on AMPK, SIRT1, and MYC levels. Our
results clearly conﬁrm that knockdown of ARK5 with siRNAs
leads to similar modulation of AMPK, SIRT1, and MYC protein
levels. These results demonstrate that ARK5 is critical for
multiple myeloma survival and reveal new insights into the
regulation of MYC via AMPK–SIRT1 signaling axis. Our ﬁndings are consistent with a model where AMPK-dependent
phosphorylation provides a direct link between cellular energy
metabolism and regulation of gene expression (31). When the
energy levels are low and the intracellular AMP/ATP ratio
elevated, AMPK becomes activated, resulting in switching off
energy-consuming pathways to restore cellular ATP levels. This

www.aacrjournals.org

drop in cellular ATP and concomitant increase in AMP levels
trigger phosphorylation-dependent activation of AMPK. These
results suggest that MYC acetylation and stability is regulated
by ARK5 upstream of SIRT1-MYC.
In addition, we provide evidence that the proliferation of
multiple myeloma cells is positively regulated by ARK5, which
coordinates the expression of mTOR, CCND1/Rb, in addition to
MYC. A direct link between MYC and the cell-cycle machinery
exists since the CCND1 and CCNE genes have been shown to be
transcriptional targets of MYC (32, 33). Deregulated MYC expression is also linked to increased cyclin A and cyclin E expression
and activation of CDK4 via its direct target gene CDC25 (34).
CDK4 has also been identiﬁed in Drosophila as a MYC target gene
(35), and the proliferative effect of MYC in multiple myeloma
cells also appears to be dependent of CDK4 activation as evidenced by the down regulation of MYC and CDK4 upon ARK5
depletion (see Fig. 5A). Therefore, our data support a synthetic
lethal interaction between CDK4 and MYC in multiple myeloma.
One potential mechanism for this synthetic lethal interaction
could be that loss of ARK5 subsequently activates apoptotic
signaling events, resulting in cell death. Subsequently, apoptotic
pathways appear to be involved in CDK4 and ARK5 inhibitor
ON123300-induced cell death, providing mechanistic insight
into MYC-CDK4 synthetic lethality in multiple myeloma cells.

and there is an increasing body of evidence implicating the mTOR
signaling pathway (36), and more speciﬁcally phosphoS6K (37),
in regulating multiple myeloma cell proliferation. Because our
results suggest that ARK5, via its ability to regulate mTOR and
MYC signaling, is a novel therapeutic target in multiple myeloma,
our data provide the foundation for further development of ARK5
inhibitors and second-generation CDK inhibitors, such as
ON123300, that target both ARK5 and CDK4 for the treatment
of multiple myeloma.
