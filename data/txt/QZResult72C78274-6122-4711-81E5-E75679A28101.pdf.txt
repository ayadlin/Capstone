Integrating Novel Therapeutic Monoclonal Antibodies Into the
Management of Head and Neck Cancer
Julie E. Bauman, MD, MPH1; and Robert L. Ferris, MD, PhD2,3,4

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is an immunosuppressive malignancy. Interest in developing novel immunotherapies
in HNSCC has been reawakened by the success of cetuximab, a therapeutic monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the epidermal growth
factor receptor, which likely relies on immune as well as antisignaling mechanisms. This review focuses on novel therapeutic mAbs in
current clinical development against established mechanisms of immune evasion in HNSCC, targeting: 1) tumor antigens, with resultant
potential to induce antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and T cell activation; 2) immunosuppressive cytokines; 3) costimulatory tumor necrosis factor-family receptors; and 4) coinhibitory immune checkpoint receptors. Clinical trials of immunotherapeutic
mAbs as monotherapy, in combination with cytolytic standard therapies exposing tumor antigens or in combination with other immunoC 2013 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION
Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the sixth leading incident cancer worldwide,1 has been recognized as
an immunosuppressive disease. HNSCC induces a tumor-permissive cytokine profile,2,3 qualitative and quantitative lymphocyte deficiencies,4-6 anergy in major immune effector cells,7-10 and poor antigen presentation.11,12 An increasing proportion of HNSCC in North America and Europe is caused by oral infection with human papillomavirus (HPV),13-15
rather than the classic exposures of tobacco and alcohol. Whether caused by environmental carcinogenesis or transformation by HPV oncogenes, HNSCC thwarts immune surveillance, recognition and destruction, which must be reversed to
maximize therapeutic efficacy.
Early clinical trials in HNSCC exploited available immunostimulatory cytokines, which faltered clinically due to disinterest in local delivery or prohibitive systemic toxicity.16-18 Three parallel advancements have reawakened enthusiasm
for the development of novel immunotherapies in HNSCC: 1) realization of the contribution of immune mechanisms to
the clinical activity of cetuximab,19,20 the monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) approved in treatment of HNSCC by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006; 2) progressive preclinical insights into specific, targetable immune escape mechanisms important to the survival of HNSCC tumors; and 3)
previously unimagined clinical responses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a nonimmunogenic solid tumor similar
to HNSCC, to phase 1 therapy with an immune checkpoint mAb.21,22 In the interest of prioritizing rational clinical investigations, this review will examine the immunotherapeutic mAbs currently in human trials for cancer patients, in the specific context of immune escape mechanisms in HNSCC. Immunotherapeutic mAbs will be conceptually divided into
those which target tumor antigens (TAs), immunosuppressive cytokines, tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) costimulatory molecules, or immune checkpoint receptors (Table 1).
TA-Targeted mAbs

Although cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) specific for p53, EGFR, or the HPV E7 oncoprotein have been detected in
patients with HNSCC,23-25 the nascent adaptive immune response is ineffective. Because of selective loss of human

leukocyte antigen (HLA) I and functional deficiency in
antigen processing machinery, HNSCC tumor cells avoid
recognition and destruction by extant TA-specific
CTLs.11,26 Recent evidence confirms that cetuximab, a
chimeric, immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)-isotype mAb
which blocks the extracellular domain of EGFR, potentiates both innate and adaptive immune responses against
endogenous TAs,19 indicating that TA-targeted mAbs
have broader immunogenic potential than is currently
being exploited.
In HNSCC, cetuximab development was compelled
by the frequent finding of overexpression of EGFR correlating with advanced stage, radiation resistance, and poor
survival.27,28 Indeed, cetuximab increased response rate
and overall survival combined with radiation in locally
advanced HNSCC, or with platinum-based chemotherapy in recurrent HNSCC, ultimately gaining FDA apCancer

proval for both indications.29,30 Cetuximab is frequently
described as the first molecularly targeted agent in
HNSCC, which is a deserved appellation; yet, certain
conundrums prompted the search for additional, immunologic mechanisms of action. First, despite overexpression of EGFR in more than 90% of HNSCC,31
cetuximab monotherapy demonstrates a response rate of
only 10% to 15% in recurrent disease.32 Moreover, overexpression or amplification of EGFR does not predict
clinical benefit from cetuximab, and activating EGFR
mutations are not found in HNSCC, underscoring the
absence of a predictive molecular marker.33,34 Second,
nonimmunogenic small-molecule inhibitors of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR have not demonstrated clinical benefit in randomized trials in
HNSCC.35,36 Third, despite rapid abrogation of EGFR
phosphorylation and tumor proliferation upon mAb

exposure in preclinical models,37 in vitro tumor cell apoptosis or lysis requires the presence of lymphocytes.11
Dissection of the immunologic actions of cetuximab
provides guidance for further development of TAtargeted mAbs in HNSCC. Specifically, cetuximabcoated HNSCC tumor cells activate the antibody-binding
receptor (FcgR IIIa) on natural killer (NK) cells, the
major effector cell of innate immunity. Binding between
the constant Fc component of the IgG mAb and FcgR
IIIa instigates antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity
(ADCC).20,38,39 Moreover, activation of FcgR IIIa upregulates NK cell secretion of interferon gamma (IFN-g),
an immunostimulatory cytokine which promotes maturation of dendritic cells (DC). NK-DC cross-priming
enhances antigen processing and presentation by DCs,
ultimately promoting activation of TA-specific CTLs. Of
interest, the repertoire of TA-specific CTLs induced by
cetuximab is not restricted to EGFR. Preclinical modeling
also demonstrates cross-priming of CTLs specific for
MAGE-3, a second TA.19 These findings suggest 3 broad
and interacting strategies to augment the therapeutic
potential of cetuximab and other TA-targeted mAbs: 1)
potentiating ADCC; 2) promoting DC maturation; and
3) releasing suppression of CTLs.
Fundamentally, ADCC requires binding between
FcgR IIIa on NK cells and the IgG Fc region on the mAbcoated tumor cell, an interaction which may be influenced
by an intrinsic patient factor, FcgR polymorphisms, or a
drug factor, the IgG isotype subclass. Differential patient
response to mAbs, including rituximab in lymphoma
(anti-CD20), trastuzumab in breast cancer (anti-HER2),
and cetuximab in colorectal cancer, has been correlated
with FcgR IIIa polymorphisms, thought to reflect Fc
binding affinities.40-42 Although these findings raise the
possibility of patient selection for mAb therapy by ADCC
capacity, a similar preclinical correlation in HNSCC was
not validated in patients. The VV FcgR IIIa genotype
favorably influenced NK cytolysis of HNSCC tumor cells
in ADCC assays,43 but was not associated with cetuximab
outcome in patients with HNSCC where it was found in
only 5% of cases.19 Thus, enhancing mAb activity by
patient selection for favorable polymorphisms is not currently suitable for the clinic.
The FcgR binding partner—the IgG Fc subclass of
the mAb itself—appears increasingly important to the efficacy of TA-targeted mAbs. In HNSCC, the case in point
is panitumumab, which is a fully humanized IgG2 mAb
specific for the same EGFR epitope as cetuximab. In contrast to IgG1, the IgG2 isotype has a low binding affinity
for FcgR IIIa and is ineffective at mediating ADCC by
626

NK cells.19,20,44 IgG2 does bind FcgR IIa on myeloidlineage lytic cells, triggering ADCC; however, the clinical
importance of this mechanism is unclear.44 Notably, panitumumab does not induce the NK-DC cross-priming
underlying the adaptive immune response.19 Unlike
cetuximab, panitumumab did not improve survival when
combined with platinum-based chemotherapy in recurrent HNSCC, although a secondary analysis noted
improvement in patients with tumors negative for p-16, a
surrogate marker for HPV within the oropharynx.45 In a
phase 2 trial in the locally advanced setting, panitumumab
combined with radiotherapy was inferior to cisplatinradiotherapy combination for the primary endpoint of 2year locoregional control.46 The failure of panitumumab
to make therapeutic inroads in HNSCC, despite identical
antisignaling properties to cetuximab, has further elevated
the hypothesis that immune mechanisms are critical to
cetuximab’s activity. This insight should inform development of subsequent TA-targeted mAbs in HNSCC, with
prioritization of IgG1 subclass drugs.
Innate or acquired resistance to cetuximab is frequently associated with compensatory signaling by alternate growth factor receptors, eg, HER2, HER3, cMet,
and insulin growth factor receptor (IGFR).47 In this light,
TA-specific mAbs targeting parallel growth factor receptors are rational candidates for investigation in HNSCC.
Representative IgG1-isotype mAbs are in clinical development. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab target HER2overexpressing breast cancer; cotargeting HER2 with both
drugs in a HER2-expressing xenograft model augmented
ADCC.48 Thus, combinatorial mAb strategies are desirable, and investigation of immune correlates will be critical
to guiding development. For example, AV-203, an antiHER3 mAb, is under phase 1 evaluation in combination
with
cetuximab
(Clinicaltrials.gov
identifier
NCT01603979). This trial includes a cetuximab-resistant
HNSCC cohort, a setting where both signaling and
immune resistance mechanisms may occur. Although cixutumumab, an anti-IGFR mAb, failed to improve
progression-free survival alone or in combination with
cetuximab as compared to cetuximab monotherapy,49 it is
now under investigation in a window-of-opportunity trial
in patients with operable HNSCC (Clinicaltrials.gov
identifier NCT00957853). In this model, both signaling
and immune mechanisms could be investigated in paired
tumor specimens.
Although FcgR-Fc binding is required for ADCC,
the NK cell’s capacity for cytolysis is significantly amplified by the immunostimulatory cytokines interleukin-12
(IL-12) and TNFa, secreted by activated DCs following

TA uptake and presentation. In the development of
IgG1-isotype mAbs in HNSCC, judicious coinvestigation
of 2 ADCC adjuncts would appear rational: exogenous
cytokines, such as IL-12, or toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists. Intravenous IL-12 has been studied in phase 1 combination with paclitaxel and trastuzumab in HER2expressing cancers, exploiting the ADCC mechanism.50
In operable HNSCC, neoadjuvant tumoral injections of
IL-12 resulted in migration of NK cells to the primary tumor and draining lymph nodes, and increased IFN-g
secretion51; these promising immunomodulatory findings
underpin an ongoing phase 2 study of cetuximab and subcutaneous IL-12 in recurrent HNSCC (NCT01468896).

secretion, and antigen presentation by DCs.52-56 Trials

Cytokine-Targeted mAbs

The immunosuppressive cytokine profile of the HNSCC
microenvironment is driven by aberrant regulation of the
signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)
family. HNSCC tumors and immune cells demonstrate
deficient immunostimulatory STAT1 signaling, and
excess immunosuppressive STAT3 signaling.3,57,58 The
STAT1/STAT3 activation imbalance results in dominant
production of TGF-b1, IL-6, IL-10, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) by HNSCC tumors and
tumor-associated macrophages.59 These cytokines inhibit
NK cell cytolysis, DC maturation, and CTL activation
while inducing regulatory T cells (Tregs).7,57,60-62
Tumor-associated fibroblasts reinforce immunosuppression through secretion of hepatocyte growth factor
(HGF), a paracrine cytokine that promotes HNSCC
proliferation and metastasis through cMet signaling
while inhibiting DC maturation.63,64 Because immunosuppressive cytokines in sera of patients with HNSCC
correlate longitudinally with poor response and relapse,2
cytokine-neutralizing mAbs may be particularly relevant
therapeutic adjuncts. Specifically, mAbs targeting VEGF
and HGF are in clinical development in HNSCC,
whereas mAbs neutralizing TGF-b1 and IL-6 are under
study in other malignancies.

ative prognostic indicators in HNSCC.66,67 Although the
phase 2 combination of bevacizumab-cetuximab had disappointing efficacy in recurrent HNSCC,68 a randomized
phase 3 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trial testing
frontline platinum-based chemotherapy with/without
bevacizumab is ongoing (NCT00588770).
Ficlatuzumab (IgG1) and rilotumumab (IgG2) are
humanized mAbs that neutralize HGF, preventing ligation of the oncogenic cMet receptor. Because HGF/cMet
signaling is implicated in resistance to standard HNSCC
therapies,69-71 trials combining these agents with cetuximab, cisplatin, and/or radiation are in development. Bearing in mind that HGF inhibits DC maturation,
companion immune biomarkers should be incorporated
into early-phase design.
Fresolimumab is an IgG4 subclass mAb that neutralizes all TGF-b isoforms, and is under phase 1 study in
myeloproliferative disorders, kidney cancer, and melanoma (NCT01291784; NCT00356460). In an HNSCC
xenograft model, adding a preclinical TGF-b mAb to
cetuximab prevented resistance to NK cell cytolysis mediated by TGF-b1.72 Siltuximab is an IgG1 chimeric mAb
against IL-6, and is under phase 2 evaluation in kidney
cancer,73 prostate cancer, and multiple myeloma
(NCT00385827; NCT01484275). Because TGF-b1 and
IL-6 are key immunosuppressive STAT3 cytokines, and
no direct STAT3 inhibitors are available, both agents are
of significant interest in HNSCC.
TNFR Family Targeted mAbs

Ultimately, effective immune eradication of tumor
requires priming of the TA-specific, HLA-I restricted,
CD8(1) CTLs by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) by its cognate TA-HLA I
complex is insufficient for differentiation of the naive
CTLs. TA recognition can be followed by anergy versus
activation, depending on the balance of coinhibitory versus costimulatory intercellular signaling across the
lymphocyte-APC “immune synapse” (Fig. 1). Priming,
cytolytic capacity, and memory cell differentiation require
predominance of costimulatory signaling by the TNFR
superfamily of accessory surface receptors. Agonist mAbs
to TNFR costimulatory members, including CD40,
OX40, and CD137, are in early clinical development.74
In most cases, these mAbs demonstrate synergy with other
immunomodulatory therapies, including the cytolytic
modalities of chemotherapy and radiation, TA-targeted
mAbs, or T cell checkpoint inhibitors.
Signaling by CD40, a TNFR expressed by APCs,
dramatically magnifies APC priming capacity. Binding of

Figure 1. Schematic shows the immune synapse. Binding of the T cell receptor (TCR; blue) to the tumor antigen-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I complex is necessary but not sufficient for TCR activation. Costimulatory signaling by the major TCR
coreceptor, CD28, is also required for full T cell activation. Moreover, activation of the T cell is modulated by the balance of positive, costimulatory signaling by the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (green; including CD40, OX40, and CD137) versus
negative, coinhibitory signaling by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1; red).

CD40 on DCs by its ligand CD40L, present solely on
activated CD4(1) T helper cells, triggers immunostimulatory cytokine secretion, upregulation of antigenprocessing machinery, and CTL priming. In HNSCC,
CD40/CD40L expression on APCs/lymphocytes
decreases with advancing stage. Moreover, monocytic
CD40 expression increases postoperatively, suggesting
this pathway is actively suppressed during HNSCC
immune evasion.75 Agonist CD40 mAbs have been developed to substitute for the critical role of the T helper cell
in licensing DC.76 A point of theoretical controversy is
that HNSCC cell lines and human tumors express CD40,
where ligation promotes proliferation and angiogenesis in
preclinical models.77,78 Nonetheless, in the first clinical
trial evaluating CD40 agonism with recombinant human
CD40L, a patient with refractory HNSCC sustained a
long-term complete response.79 CP-870,893, a humanized IgG2 mAb with CD40 agonist activity, demonstrated
efficacy in melanoma during phase 1 evaluation.80 CP870,893 may be more active when added to treatments
that release TA, such as cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation. Phase 1 combinations with carboplatin-paclitaxel or
628

gemcitabine showed immunologic and clinical
responses.81,82
Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HNSCC
display an anergic phenotype associated with low expression of the costimulatory TNFRs, OX40 and CD137.10
OX40 signaling supports survival, clonal expansion,
inflammatory cytokine production, and memory function
in T helper cells; conversely, suppression by Tregs is
relieved.83,84 Although not explicitly evaluated in
HNSCC preclinical models, OX40 agonism has arrested
both immunogenic and nonimmunogenic solid tumors85;
however as with CD40, more robust responses were seen
upon combination with cytolytic treatments.86 An OX40
agonist mAb is under phase 1 study in combination with
radiation in breast and prostate cancers (NCT01642290;
NCT01303705). CD137 signaling enhances proliferation, inflammatory cytokine production, cytolytic
capacity, and survival of CTLs87; similar to OX40, ligation of CD137 on Tregs can paradoxically release immunosuppression.88 CD137 on NK cells also costimulates
ADCC. A significant proportion of HNSCC patients
receiving cetuximab demonstrate upregulation of CD137

on NK cells, which correlating with the VV and VF FcgR
IIIa polymorphisms.89 In HNSCC preclinical models,
cetuximab induces CD137 upregulation on NK cells; sequential treatment with a CD137 mAb enhances cytolytic
activity.89 Urelumab is a humanized IgG4 agonist mAb
against CD137 which has been evaluated in dose-finding
trials in melanoma, NSCLC, and lymphoma. Because serious hepatotoxicity limited dose escalation, lower-dose
phase 1 studies have resumed, including a combination
trial with rituximab (NCT01471210; NCT01775631).
Similarly, PF-05082566 is an IgG2 CD137 agonist mAb
under evaluation in combination with rituximab
(NCT01307267). In HNSCC, combinatorial trials with
cetuximab, chemotherapy, or radiation are warranted.
Immune Checkpoint-Targeted mAbs

The therapeutic complement to agonism of costimulatory
TNFRs is blockade of coinhibitory receptors. HNSCC
TILs are characterized by high expression of the coinhibitory receptors cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen
4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 (PD-1), which are
so-called “immune checkpoints.”10,90 CTLA-4 is a surface
glycoprotein progressively expressed by CTLs following
TCR ligation. CTLA-4 down-modulates immune
response to chronic antigen stimulation, preventing autoimmunity; however, in the case of cancer, CTLA-4 promotes inappropriate tolerance and immune escape. Tregs
in the HNSCC microenvironment constitutively express
CTLA-4,91 which competes with the major costimulatory
receptor CD28 for the B7 ligands, CD80, and CD86
(Fig. 1). Thus, mAb blockade of CTLA-4 frees CD28 to
bind B7 and propagate the necessary TCR costimulatory
signal. Inhibition of Treg CTLA-4 signaling also releases
CTL suppression, potentiating TA-targeted cytolysis.92
This novel therapeutic paradigm culminated in the first
FDA approval of an immune checkpoint inhibitor for
melanoma, an IgG4 anti-CTLA-4 mAb, ipilimumab.93
Ipilimumab has intriguing potential to reverse immunosuppression in HNSCC, alone or in combination with
other immunogenic therapies. Of particular interest to
trial design, CTLA-4 inhibition potentiates the abscopal
effect when combined with fractionated radiotherapy: in
breast and colon cancer radiation experiments, a preclinical CTLA-4 mAb inhibited out-of-field secondary tumor
growth.94 A phase 1 trial of cetuximab, ipilimumab, and
intensity-modulated radiotherapy in the management of
locally advanced HNSCC is now accruing
(NCT01860430).
Similar to CTLA-4, PD-1 is an inhibitory member
of the B7-CD28 family of coreceptors. Following TCR
Cancer

activation, PD-1 is expressed by multiple immune cells
including CTLs, NK cells, B lymphocytes, monocytes,
and DCs. The PD-1 ligand, PD-L1, is expressed broadly
on nonhematopoietic tissue in response to IFN-g; thus,
PD-1 ligation is thought to broadly protect against autoimmunity and immune destruction of normal tissue during infection.95 PD-L1 is also expressed in the majority of
HNSCC, and is explicitly linked to the immuneprivileged, invasive front of HPV-transformed
HNSCC.96-98 Infiltration by PD-1-expressing T cells is
associated with favorable prognosis in HPV-associated
disease; this paradox highlights the importance of prior
immune response and the therapeutic potential of restoring it by PD-1 blockade.90
Therapeutic targeting of PD-1 or PD-L1 block the
coinhibitory signal at the immune synapse. Nivolumab, a
humanized IgG4 anti-PD-1 mAb, was investigated in
advanced solid tumors.22 Objective response rates in this
heavily treated population were notable in renal cell carcinoma (27%), melanoma (28%), and NSCLC (18%). An
important preliminary observation correlated objective
response with PD-L1-positive tumors. BMS-936559, a
humanized IgG4 mAb which inhibits binding of PD-L1
to both PD-1 and CD80, also resulted in objective
responses in a phase 1 study for patients with pretreated,
advanced solid tumors, including NSCLC (10%). AntiPD-1 and anti-PD-L1 mAbs are of pressing interest for
therapeutic development in HPV-positive and HPVnegative HNSCC.
Conclusions

Successful development of novel immunotherapeutic
mAbs in the treatment of HNSCC can be guided by
recent insights into the immune mechanisms of cetuximab, the first FDA-approved immunotherapy in
HNSCC, as well as dissection of immune evasion by
HNSCC. In addition to blocking EGFR signaling, cetuximab induces ADCC, DC maturation, and cross-priming
of EGFR-specific CTLs, all of which are immune mechanisms that could be augmented by cotreatment with other
TA-targeted mAbs, exogenous IL-12 or TLR stimulation,
mAbs to neutralize immunosuppressive cytokines, mAbs
to enhance antigen presentation, or mAbs favorably influencing costimulatory versus coinhibitory receptor signaling. However, the strategic vision for novel therapeutic
mAbs should not be limited to coadministration with
cetuximab. HNSCC exploits numerous redundant and
mutually reinforcing immune escape mechanisms, including an imbalanced STAT1/STAT3 cytokine profile,
downregulation of antigen processing and presentation,

underexpression of costimulatory receptors, and overexpression of coinhibitory receptors in TILs. Targeting these
nodes of immunosuppression may be of independent
therapeutic value, and holds the promise of synergy with
standard cytotoxic modalities exposing TAs, including
chemotherapy and radiation. Clinical trials evaluating
monotherapeutic and combinatorial mAb strategies,
including combinations with cytolytic therapy, are of
urgent priority.
