BACKGROUND: Vitamin D deficiency has potential roles in breast cancer etiology and progression. Vitamin D deficiency has also been associated with increased toxicity from bisphosphonate therapy. The optimal dose of vitamin D
supplementation is unknown, but daily sunlight exposure can generate the equivalent of a 10,000-IU oral dose of
vitamin D3. This study therefore aimed to assess the effect of this dose of vitamin D3 in patients with bone metastases from breast cancer. METHODS: Patients with bone metastases treated with bisphosphonates were enrolled into
this single-arm phase 2 study. Patients received 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 and 1000 mg of calcium supplementation
each day for 4 months. The effect of this treatment on palliation, bone resorption markers, calcium metabolism, and
toxicity were evaluated at baseline and monthly thereafter. RESULTS: Forty patients were enrolled. No significant
changes in bone resorption markers were seen. Despite no change in global pain scales, there was a significant
reduction in the number of sites of pain. A small but statistically significant increase in serum calcium was seen, as
was a significant decrease in serum parathyroid hormone. Treatment unmasked 2 cases of primary hyperparathyroidism, but was not associated with direct toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Daily doses of 10,000 IU vitamin D3 for 4 months
appear safe in patients without comorbid conditions causing hypersensitivity to vitamin D. Treatment reduced inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone levels, presumably caused by long-term bisphosphonate use. There did not
appear to be a significant palliative benefit nor any significant change in bone resorption. Cancer 2010;116:284–91.

The importance of vitamin D in the pathogenesis and progression of breast cancer has been demonstrated by in vitro

studies,1-3 animal studies,3,4 and in geographic, epidemiologic studies.5,6 In addition, in some studies, lower measured levels of vitamin D metabolites (25-hydroxyvitamin D) have been shown to correlate with poor prognosis from breast cancer.7,8 These observations are countered by other evidence, including a recent meta-analysis of vitamin D and breast
cancer risk9 as well as a large randomized trial of vitamin D supplementation10 that did not demonstrate a benefit to supplementation with vitamin D. Because of this conflicting evidence, there remains no consensus as to the optimal administration of this agent in patients with breast cancer. Because calcium and vitamin D metabolism are especially important in
the context of bone metastases from breast cancer, improving the evidence base on the utility of vitamin D in this setting
could be of significant benefit.
The long-term use of bisphosphonates has been shown to affect calcium metabolism adversely in patients with both
osteoporosis and Paget disease of bone. These effects predominantly include hypocalcemia and resultant secondary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, it has been recommended that clinicians encourage calcium and vitamin D supplements in

patients receiving long-term bisphosphonate therapy.11 In
metastatic disease, there is, to our knowledge, a paucity of
data on the extent of calcium and vitamin D supplementation, although in many centers such supplementation has
been recommended.12 Work in the metastatic breast cancer setting has shown that supplementation with 400 IU/
day vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) does not prevent a disturbance of calcium metabolism. This may be related to
prolonged, high-dose bisphosphonate dosing in these
patients resulting in a relative hyperparathyroidism, similar to that seen with bisphosphonate use in benign bone
disease. In an exploratory analysis, 46 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were premedicated with vitamin
D at a dose of 400 IU/day and who were receiving third
generation bisphosphonate therapy were compared with a
matched historical control group with neither breast cancer nor bone/mineral disease.13 In patients with metastatic
breast cancer, unlike in benign bone disease, daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D was not sufficient to
prevent secondary hyperparathyroidism. More striking
was the finding that despite standard vitamin supplementation, 62% of patients had suboptimal levels of serum 25hydroxyvitamin D (<75 nmol/L), and 18% had either
insufficient or grossly deficient levels. Furthermore,
patients with metastatic breast cancer to bone often complain of musculoskeletal pain, and evidence from noncancer patients has shown that bone pain can be a
manifestation of hypovitaminosis D3.14 Consequently, it
was hypothesized that a substantively greater supplementation of vitamin D should be considered,13 and that it
would be reasonable to expect improvements in palliation
in this setting.
At least 4 studies support the concept that maximal
cutaneous synthesis of vitamin D (ie, full-body, maximal
exposure to sunlight) can be equivalent to an oral vitamin D3 intake of 10,000 IU/day.15-18 Furthermore, a
review of data from vitamin D supplementation studies
reveals a dose-response curve for vitamin D that is relatively linear up to 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day,
suggesting that this dose may be a physiologic upper
limit.19 The present study aimed to assess the effects of
a high physiological dose of vitamin D (10,000 IU per
day) on both palliation and bone turnover in women
with bone metastases from breast cancer. The effects of
this treatment on pain and bone resorption markers
were measured, as was its ability to ameliorate the secondary hyperparathyroidism of prolonged high-dose
bisphosphonate therapy given to breast cancer patients
with bone metastases.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
Women with histologically confirmed metastatic breast
cancer and with radiologic or pathologic evidence of bone
metastases, who were clinically stable (defined as no
change in systemic therapy for at least 1 month before
study entry), had a Karnofsky performance score 60,
and had a life expectancy of 6 months were eligible.
Subjects continued their standard cancer therapies (ie, endocrine therapy, chemotherapy, and bisphosphonate).
Exclusion criteria included pre-existing hypercalcemia, a
history of renal stone disease, a known hypersensitivity to
vitamin D, severe renal or hepatic dysfunction (defined as
serological test 2 the upper normal range), and pregnancy or lactation. Furthermore, any patients who developed hyperparathyroidism, hypercalcemia, sustained
hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, or deteriorating renal
function while on study were withdrawn from the trial
and had all vitamin D supplements stopped.
Study Endpoints
The primary objectives of this prospective study were to
assess the palliative benefit of 10,000 IU of vitamin D3
daily, reflected through validated pain scores and the bone
resorption marker urinary N-telopeptide. Secondary
objectives consisted of the evaluation of metabolic consequences of high-dose vitamin D, including serologic
changes in calcium, vitamin D, and parathyroid hormone
(PTH), as well as toxicity or adverse side effects during
treatment.
Trial Design
A prospective, single-center, single-arm, phase 2 trial evaluating changes in palliation and biochemical markers of
bone turnover and metabolism was performed. The local
research ethics board approved the study protocol. After
patients provided written informed consent to participate
in the study, all subjects received oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) at a daily dose of 10,000 IU for 4 months, along
with 1000 mg/d elemental calcium. Vitamin D3 was
administered in liquid form (Ddrops, 1000 IU per oil
drop, Toronto, Canada) to reduce the quantity of tablets
that needed to be ingested.
Most previous studies describing the biochemical
response and safety of high-dose vitamin D were conducted for up to 20 weeks.15-18 Furthermore, toxicities
have been described at doses of 20,000 IU for 12 weeks20;
therefore, a 4-month duration at a dose of 10,000 IU was
conservatively chosen as an optimal balance between

likelihood of response and expected toxicity profile. Selfreported compliance was assessed at each follow-up visit
by individual investigators. Assessments of palliative and
biochemical response were performed at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4
months of the study.
Palliative response was assessed using the Brief Pain
Inventory21 and the Functional Assessment of Cancer
Therapy-Bone Pain,22,23 both validated questionnaires.
At the study assessment time points, second-pass morning
urine samples were collected, and blood was drawn for
laboratory tests. Urine samples were assayed for calcium
and creatinine by a standard kinetic Jaffe method and for
urinary N-telopeptide with the Osteomark enzyme immunoassay kit (Wampole Laboratories, Princeton NJ).
The laboratory reference interval for urinary N-telopeptide was 26-124 nmol/mmol creatinine. Serum was tested
for calcium (corrected for albumin), albumin, PTH, 25hydroxyvitamin D (measured by radioimmunoassay, DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minn), and creatinine. Samples for
PTH were drawn in the morning to avoid any diurnal variation and analyzed immediately. The laboratory reference interval for PTH (Roche Diagnostics, Montreal,
Canada) was 1.7 to 7.6 pmol/L. Intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were <3%.
Statistical Analysis
Data were presented descriptively as means, medians, or
proportions. Ordinal logistic regression analysis using a
repeated measures structure was used to compare pain
control over the 4-month period relative to baseline. Generalized estimating equations were also used in a repeated
measures analysis on a number of pain sites and urinary
N-telopeptide, PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels relative to baseline. An initial assessment of urinary N-telopeptide, PTH, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D revealed that
they were skewed by some extreme values. This is a common occurrence with such markers, and the standard
practice of normalizing the distribution by taking its natural logarithm was used. The adequacy of the procedure
was verified by inspection of the normal plots and application of the Skew test. All of the statistical analyses were
performed using Stata statistical software (release 9.0; StataCorp, College Station, Tex).

well as urinary bone resorption markers in the lowest tertile of the normal range (Table 2). Compliance was complete, with all patients reporting that they ingested the
required doses of both vitamin D3 and calcium.

study. Both these patients were subsequently discovered
to have primary hyperparathyroidism. In 1 of these
patients, the baseline value for protein-corrected calcium
was in the normal range (2.67 mmol/L), but the uncorrected level was elevated (2.8 mmol/L), with an inappropriately elevated PTH (15.4 pmol/L). In the second
patient, baseline calcium was in the normal range (2.4
mmol/L), but PTH was marginally elevated (8.6 pmol/L)
and despite falling after administration of study drug, did
not demonstrate appropriate suppression with the development of hypercalcemia. One of these patients required

DISCUSSION
Several in vitro,1-3 epidemiologic,5,6 and in vivo7,8 studies
suggest a role for vitamin D and calcium metabolism in
the development of breast cancer and regulation of carcinogenesis. The exact mechanism by which vitamin D may
play a role in the development and progression of breast
cancer remains unknown, but it is hypothesized that it
may affect the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation as well as inhibiting angiogenesis.26 These
anticancer properties have been attributed primarily to
the active hormone 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. Cancer
cells are known to express the intracellular receptors (vitamin D receptors [VDRs]) for 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.
When VDR is activated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D
binding and translocated to the nucleus, it binds to
vitamin D response elements on >60 genes, resulting in
an up-regulation of differentiation, proliferation, and
metastasis.18

High-Dose Vitamin D and Bone Metastases/Amir et al

Vitamin D has been recommended as an adjunct to
bisphosphonate therapy in patients with metastatic breast
cancer and bone metastases.27 Unfortunately, to the best
of our knowledge, there are no robust data as to the optimal dosing of vitamin D in metastatic breast cancer
patients treated with bisphosphonates. Our group and
others have shown that vitamin D supplementation of
400 IU/d was insufficient to completely correct the resultant secondary hyperparathyroidism seen with long-term
bisphosphonate use.13,28 It was therefore hypothesized
that higher vitamin D dosing may be required in this setting, at least for some subjects.
In both North America and Europe, the upper level
for recommended vitamin D supplementation is currently
2000 IU/d.29,30 However, because exposure to sunlight
can provide an adult with vitamin D in an amount
equivalent to daily oral consumption of up to 10,000 IU/
day,15-18 this dose would appear to be intuitively safe. A
review of the toxicities of vitamin D has shown that except
in patients with conditions causing hypersensitivity, there
is no evidence of adverse effects with serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations equivalent to 10,000 IU/day.19
Furthermore, a recent phase 1 clinical trial of vitamin D3
indicates safety at daily levels >10,000 IU.31
This preliminary phase 2 trial assessed the effects of
10,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day on palliation, bone
resorption markers, biochemical markers of calcium and
bone metabolism, and toxicity. Results indicated that,
despite significant increases in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin
D and calcium with an associated fall in PTH, there was
no significant change in overall palliation or in bone
resorption markers. Of interest, results showed that there
were significantly fewer sites of pain with study treatment.
However, in the context of nonsignificant changes in
global pain measures, the clinical implication of this is
unclear. This finding therefore needs to be evaluated in
further studies. It was noted that 10,000 IU a day of vitamin D3 for 4 months is safe in patients without comorbid
conditions causing hypersensitivity to vitamin D.
A potential explanation for the results noted above
may lie in the nature of the bisphosphonate protocols.
Bisphosphonates can potently reduce telopeptide levels,32,33 which correlate well with reduced pain.34,35
Patients in this study had already been treated with
bisphosphonates for a mean duration of 15.2 months and
it is possible that these patients had therefore already experienced the maximal suppression of their bone turnover.
If suppression was maximal, then neither telopeptide levels nor pain scores would be expected to change as a result

of a high dose of vitamin D. It should be emphasized that
patients in this study were administered different
bisphosphonates, and these were given both orally and
intravenously. As the bioavailability of oral bisphosphonates is highly variable,36 it could be argued that this may
impact on the results of the study. However, the authors
believe that the cumulative doses of bisphosphonates
administered in the oncology setting are so high that differences in bioavailability are not likely to be significant in
these cases.
Baseline levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D showed that
despite the majority (72.5%) of patients receiving prior
supplementation with between 400 and 800 IU of vitamin D, only 17 (42.5%) patients had optimal levels of
vitamin D (defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D level >75
nmol/L). Of those with suboptimal levels (57.5%), 5
patients (12.5%) had insufficient levels, defined as 25hydroxyvitamin D between 20 and 39 nmol/L, and 1
patient (2.5%) had a frankly deficient level, defined as 25hydroxyvitamin D <20 nmol/L. Furthermore, baseline
serum PTH was in the upper tertile of the normal range
and, subsequent to administration of 10,000 IU of daily
vitamin D3, levels fell markedly. These findings support
the hypothesis that despite the majority of patients already
being supplemented with vitamin D at current recommended levels, further supplementation at high physiologic doses further reduces the assumed secondary
hyperparathyroidism. This evidence supports the hypothesis that higher doses of vitamin D supplementation may
be required in metastatic breast cancer patients with bone
metastases.
In the majority of patients (95%), an adverse effect
as reflected by serum or urinary calcium levels was not
found. Two (5%) patients did develop hypercalcemia
with associated increases in their urinary calcium excretion. On reviewing the records of these patients, 1 had
baseline hypercalcemia with an inappropriately high
PTH, and the other patient had a baseline serum calcium
in the upper tertile with a PTH above the normal range. It
was therefore concluded that both patients had occult primary hyperparathyroidism, which was unmasked by vitamin D administration. In the latter patient, the
hypercalcemia that normally accompanies primary hyperparathyroidism was no doubt blunted by the initial vitamin D insufficiency. The hypercalcemic patient was
treated successfully with parathyroidectomy, with subsequent increases in bone mineral density. It would therefore appear that high-dose vitamin D can uncover
compensated primary hyperparathyroidism, a condition

289

Original Article

associated with breast cancer.37 Whether these patients
can be considered to have suffered from vitamin D toxicity is a matter of some contention. It could be argued that
neither patient developed treatment toxicity, as treatment
simply exposed a pre-existing condition rather causing
direct toxicity. However, in view of the increased prevalence of hyperparathyroidism among breast cancer
patients,37 this limitation in the administration of highdose vitamin D needs to be highlighted, despite it having
been described previously.38 Furthermore, although the
results of this study do not support high-dose supplementation, many patients choose to supplement with significant doses of vitamin D on their own accord. Patients
considering supplementation above currently recommended levels should be made aware of the possible toxicities of treatment with vitamin D, and baseline calcium
and PTH should be ascertained. Clinicians should also be
aware of described toxicities from high doses of vitamin
D. These have been comprehensively described in the literature and include hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and even renal impairment.39,40
In summary, although this study did not meet its
primary endpoint of demonstrating significant changes in
pain or bone turnover markers, the effects of high physiologic doses of vitamin D did show some indication of clinical benefit, as manifested by a reduction in the number of
sites of pain. Furthermore, this therapy helped unmask
underlying endocrinopathy, specifically primary hyperparathyroidism. Interestingly, there was also an apparent
correction of the presumed secondary hyperparathyroidism in this heavily bisphosphonate-pretreated population,
and the role of higher doses of vitamin D for this purpose
warrants further investigation. The results of this study
therefore lend some support to the notion that there is an
overall need for higher-dose vitamin D supplementation
in metastatic breast cancer with bone metastases. Further
trials will help clarify the optimal dose of supplementation
in this population, but should screen and follow diligently
for masked hyperparathyroid states.
