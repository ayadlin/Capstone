Abstract
Small-molecule inhibitors of PARP are thought to mediate their antitumor effects as catalytic inhibitors
that block repair of DNA single-strand breaks (SSB). However, the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors with regard to their effects in cancer cells is not fully understood. In this study, we show that PARP
inhibitors trap the PARP1 and PARP2 enzymes at damaged DNA. Trapped PARP–DNA complexes were more
cytotoxic than unrepaired SSBs caused by PARP inactivation, arguing that PARP inhibitors act in part as
poisons that trap PARP enzyme on DNA. Moreover, the potency in trapping PARP differed markedly among
inhibitors with niraparib (MK-4827) > olaparib (AZD-2281) >> veliparib (ABT-888), a pattern not correlated
with the catalytic inhibitory properties for each drug. We also analyzed repair pathways for PARP–DNA
complexes using 30 genetically altered avian DT40 cell lines with preestablished deletions in speciﬁc DNA
repair genes. This analysis revealed that, in addition to homologous recombination, postreplication repair,
the Fanconi anemia pathway, polymerase b, and FEN1 are critical for repairing trapped PARP–DNA
complexes. In summary, our study provides a new mechanistic foundation for the rational application of
PARP inhibitors in cancer therapy. Cancer Res; 72(21); 5588–99. 2012 AACR.

Introduction
PARP1 is an abundant nuclear protein and the founding
member of the PARP family (1–4). It binds damaged DNA
through its N-terminal zinc ﬁnger motifs, which activates its
catalytic C-terminal domain to hydrolyze NADþ and produce linear and branched PAR chains that can extend over
hundreds of ADP-ribose units (1–4; see Fig. 7B). PARP2,
although less abundant and contributing 5% to 10% of the
total PARP activity (1, 5), is essential for the viability of
PARP1 knockout mice (6). The rapid binding of PARP1
to DNA strand breaks is critical for the resealing of DNA
single-strand breaks (SSB) during base excision repair (BER;
refs. 7–9) and for the repair of topoisomerase I cleavage
complexes (10) and DNA double-strand breaks (DSB; refs. 11,
12). AutoPARylation of PARP1 and PARP2, and PARylation
of chromatin proteins promote the recruitment of DNA
repair factors (1, 13, 14). Because of the high negative charge

of PAR polymers, extensive autoPARylation of PARP1 and
PARP2 leads to their dissociation from DNA, which is
required for DNA repair completion (15).
A large number of SSBs are generated endogenously as well
as BER intermediates (16). When SSBs are encountered by
replication forks, they generate DSBs that need to be repaired
by homologous recombination (HR; refs. 17, 18). Accordingly,
PARP inhibition results in the accumulation of recombinogenic substrates marked by RAD51 and g-H2AX nuclear foci
(19, 20). This explains why cancer cells deﬁcient in BRCA1 and
BRCA2 are selectively hypersensitive to PARP inhibitors (21–
23). Recent studies have also suggested that disruptions of
Fanconi anemia (FA)- or other HR-related genes also sensitize
cells to PARP inhibitors (24, 25), providing a strong rationale
for the development of PARP inhibitors for cancer treatment
(4, 26, 27).
Olaparib (AZD2281), veliparib (ABT-888), and niraparib
(MK-4827) are PARP inhibitors in advance clinical trials. They
are highly efﬁcacious PARP catalytic inhibitors with IC50 values
reaching the low nanomolar range (4, 27–29). Their structure
includes a nicotinamide moiety that competes with NADþ
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and see Fig. 7B). Assuming that the
synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors in the context of HR or
BRCA deﬁciencies is solely explained by catalytic inhibition,
the drugs should have a similar effect as PARP deletion.
However, wild-type cells are more sensitive to a PARP inhibitor
combined with the alkylating agent methylmethane sulfonate
(MMS) than Parp1/ mouse cells (30–32). Furthermore, PARP
inhibition delays SSB repair to a greater extent than PARP
depletion (33). To explain these results, a PARP1-trapping
model has been proposed (18, 32). This model is based on the
idea that PARP1 is trapped on DNA by PARP inhibitors,

and PARP1–DNA complexes can interfere with DNA replication. Recently, increased PARP1 association with DNA in
alkylation damage by a PARP inhibitor was reported using
chromatin immunoprecipitation. However, accumulation of
PARP1 was not detected in chromatin-bound fraction at the
protein level (32).
Our study shows that, in addition to catalytic inhibition,
PARP inhibitors induce cytotoxic PARP–DNA complexes, and
we provide methods to detect such complexes. Secondly, we
show that clinically relevant PARP inhibitors differ markedly in
their potency to trap PARP–DNA complexes. Finally, we reveal
previously unknown repair factors/pathways for the PARP–
DNA complexes, and we discuss their importance in the
context of personalized medicine.

Materials and Methods
Cell lines
The DT40 cell lines used in this study were obtained from the
Laboratory of Radiation Genetics Graduate School of Medicine
in Kyoto University (Kyoto, Japan). The summary of the DT40
mutant cell lines is described in Supplementary Table S1. All
human cancer cell lines were obtained from the National
Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program (Frederick, MD).
Immunoblotting
To prepare whole cell lysates, cells were lysed with CelLytic M Lysis Reagent (C2978, Sigma-Aldrich). After thorough mixing and incubation at 4 C for 30 minutes, lysate
were centrifuged at 15,000  g at 4 C for 10 minutes, and
supernatants were collected. To prepare subcellular fraction
of nuclear soluble and chromatin-bound fraction, 10 million
DT40 cells with 10 mL medium in 15 mL tube or semiconﬂuent human cells with 10 mL medium in 10 cm dish were
treated with indicated drugs for 30 minutes or 4 hours,
respectively, and then cells were collected. For the fractionation, we used a Subcellular Protein Fractionation Kit from
Thermo Scientiﬁc (78840) following the manufacturer's
instructions. Immunoblotting was carried out using standard procedures. Densitometric analyses of immunoblots
were carried out using Image J software (NIH). Further
explanation of fractionation methods is available in the
Supplementary Experimental Procedures.
Antibodies
Rabbit polyclonal anti-PARP1 antibody (sc-7150), mouse
monoclonal anti–proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)
antibody (sc-56), and mouse monoclonal anti-FANCD2 antibody (sc-20022) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Mouse
monoclonal anti–g-H2AX antibody (05-636) and rabbit polyclonal anti-histone H3 antibody (07-690) were from Upstate
Biotechnology. Mouse monoclonal anti-actin antibody (A3853)
and rabbit anti–g-tubulin antibody (T3559) were from Sigma.
Mouse monoclonal anti-Top1 antibody (#556597) was from BD
Biosciences. Rabbit polyclonal anti-PAR polymer antibody
(#4336-BPC-100) was from Trevigen. Rabbit polyclonal antiPARP2 antibody (ab93416) was from Abcam. Secondary anti-

bodies were horseradish peroxidase–conjugated antibodies to
mouse or rabbit IgG (GE Healthcare).
Immunoassay for PAR substrate
The validated chemiluminescent immunoassay for PAR
using commercially available reagents is described previously
(34). The detailed laboratory procedures can be viewed from
NCI website at http://dctd.cancer.gov/ResearchResources/
biomarkers/PolyAdenosylRibose.htm
Measurement of cellular sensitivity to DNA-damaging
agents
To measure the sensitivity of cells to drugs, cells were
continuously exposed to various concentrations of the drugs
for 72 hours in triplicate. For DT40 cells, 200 cells were seeded
into 384-well white plate (#6007680 PerkinElmer Life Sciences)
in 40 mL of medium per well. For human cells, 1,500 cells of
DU145 or 500 cells of SF295 were seeded in 96-well white plate
(#6005680 PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 100 mL of medium per
well. Cell survival was determined using the ATPlite 1-step kit
(PerkinElmer). Brieﬂy, 20 mL or 50 mL ATPlite solution for 384well or 96-well plate, respectively, was added to each well. After
5 minutes, luminescence was measured by EnVision 2104
Multilabel Reader (PerkinElmer). The ATP level in untreated
cells was deﬁned as 100%. Percent viability of treated cells was
deﬁned as treated cells/untreated cells  100.
Evaluation of the relative cellular sensitivity across a
panel of DT40 mutant cells
The cellular sensitivity assay using a 384-well plate allowed
us to examine 6 different cell lines at the same time, while we
always included wild-type cells in each plate for normalization.
To evaluate the relative cellular sensitivity of each mutant to
wild-type cells, we drew the single logarithm sensitivity curve
by setting the survival of untreated cells as 100%. The concentration that causes 90% reduction of ATP activity (inhibition
concentration 90%; IC90) by olaparib or niraparib, and the
concentration that causes 50% reduction (IC50) by veliparib,
were determined manually from the sensitivity curves. The IC90
and IC50 of each mutant were divided by the IC90 and IC50 of
wild-type cells on the same plate, respectively. Finally, the
quotient was converted into logarithmic scale (base 2).
siRNA transfection
Gene-speciﬁc siRNAs (mix of 4 sequences) for PARP1
(L-006656-00-0005), PARP2 (L-010127-02-0005), and negative
control siRNA (D-001810-10) were products of Dharmacon.
Ten nanomolar of each siRNA was transfected to DU145 and
SF295 cells with Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (13778,
Invitorogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Culture medium was changed 6 to 8 hours after the transfection. The transfected cells were trypsinized and seeded on a 96well plate 48 hours after the transfection. Drugs were added 12
hours after the seeding, and cells were incubated for another 72
hours before ATP activity was measured. To conﬁrm the
downregulation of each protein, the transfected cells were
collected for the Western blot analysis 72 hours after the
transfection.

Drug preparation
Olaparib, veliparib, and niraparib were obtained from the
Drug Synthesis and Chemistry Branch, National Cancer Institute (Bethesda, MD). 4-Amino-1,8-naphthalimide (4-AN) was
from Sigma-Aldrich (A0966). Drug stock solutions were made
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) at 10 mmol/L. The stock solutions were stored at 20 C in dark and diluted in the culture
medium immediately before use. One percent or 10% MMS was
prepared fresh each time from 99% MMS (129925, SigmaAldrich) in PBS, and then diluted in culture medium to ﬁnal
concentration.

truncated mutant; ref. 36) DT40 cells to olaparib (Fig. 1D). As
expected, BRCA2tr/ cells showed greater sensitivity than
wild-type. PARP1/ cells were highly resistant to olaparib,
showing the drug selectivity for PARP1. Cell-cycle analyses
revealed that olaparib had no impact on the cell cycle of
PARP1/ cells, whereas it induced G2 accumulation in wildtype and massive apoptosis in BRCA2tr/ cells (Fig. 1E).
g-H2AX levels were also signiﬁcantly increased by olaparib in
wild-type cells but not in PARP1/ cells (Fig. 1F). These results
show that PARP1 is required for the cytotoxicity of olaparib and
that PARP inhibition is not equivalent to PARP deletion.

Fluorescence anisotropy DNA-binding assay
The ﬂuorescence anisotropy experiment was carried out
with a 30 bp duplex labeled with 50 -Alexa Fluor488. The
deoxyoligonucleotide (sequence: 50 -Alexa Fluor 488ACCCTGCTGTGGGCdUGGAGAACAAGGTGAT) was annealed
to its complementary DNA strand in buffer containing 50
mmol/L potassium acetate, 20 mmol/L tris-acetate, 10
mmol/L magnesium acetate, and 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol, pH
7.9. All oligonucleotides were purchased from Integrated DNA
Technologies. Uracil-DNA glycosylase and APE1 (New England
Biolabs) were added to the annealed DNA sample and incubated at 37 C for 1 hour. The resulting DNA construct contains
a DNA nick and a 50 -deoxyribose-5-phosphate (50 -dRP) at the
nicked site. The completion of digestion is veriﬁed by denaturing PAGE. For ﬂuorescence anisotropy measurements, 250
nmol/L recombinant PARP1 (a kind gift from Dr. Valerie
Schreiber, University of Strasbourg, France), 1 nmol/L DNA
construct, and increasing concentration of PARP inhibitors
were combined and incubated for 30 minutes in buffer containing 50 mmol/L Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 4 mmol/L MgCl2, 100 mmol/L
NaCl, and 100 ng/mL BSA. A total of 1 mM NADþ was added to
the samples to initiate the experiment, and the ﬂuorescence
anisotropy values were measured at indicated time using an
EnVision 2104 Multilabel Reader equipped with a FITC FP Label
(PerkinElmer). The control samples lack NADþ or PARP inhibitor. The ﬂuorescence anisotropy values reported here were
average of 2 independent experiments (each experiment was
measured in duplicates).

Olaparib stabilizes toxic PARP1–DNA complexes
The ﬁnding that the cytotoxicity of olaparib was selective
for PARP1-proﬁcient cells raised the possibility that olaparib
might generate toxic DNA lesions mediated by PARP1 at
spontaneously occurring base lesions. To examine such possibility, we fractionated wild-type DT40 cell lysates into nuclear-soluble and chromatin-bound fractions. To increase base
damage, we combined olaparib with low dose of the classic
alkylating agent MMS. Under drug-free condition, most PARP1
was in the nuclear-soluble fraction (Fig 2A, lanes 1 and 7).
Olaparib or MMS alone slightly increased PARP1 chromatin
binding (Fig 2A, lanes 8 and 9, and 2B). Notably, in the presence
of MMS, increasing the concentration of olaparib greatly
induced PARP1 accumulation in the chromatin-bound fraction
(Fig. 2A, lanes 10–12, and 2B). Under these conditions, PAR
levels were reduced by olaparib even in the presence of
0.01% MMS (Fig. 2A).
To examine the cytotoxicity of the olaparib-induced PARP1–
DNA complexes, we determined the cytotoxicity of MMS
with increasing concentrations of olaparib in wild-type and
PARP1/ cells (Fig. 2C). As expected from the widely accepted concept that PARylation is necessary for BER, PARP1/
cells were hypersensitive to MMS. Moreover, olaparib had
no impact on MMS sensitivity in PARP1/ cells (Fig. 2C,
right), conﬁrming the lack of "off-target effects" of olaparib.
In parallel, olaparib synergistically sensitized wild-type cells
to MMS in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig 2C,
left). Notably, the MMS sensitivity of wild-type cells treated
with olaparib was greater than that of PARP1/ cells (compare left and right in Fig. 2C). These results indicate that
PARylation inhibition does not simply explain the hypersensitivity of olaparib-treated cells to MMS. Cell-cycle responses
in wild-type cells (Fig. 2D) also showed that the combination
of olaparib with MMS suppressed BrdUrd incorporation
more than either single treatment, and also induced sub-G1
accumulation after 4 hours, indicative of dying cells. In contrast, olaparib had no additional impact on PARP1/ cells as
compared with MMS alone. Together, these results show
that olaparib synergistically increases the cytotoxicity of MMS
in a PARP1-dependent manner, as it induces the trapping
of PARP1–DNA complexes.

Results
PARP inhibition by olaparib is more cytotoxic than
genetic depletion of PARP
To compare the effect of PARP deletion and PARP inhibition,
we took advantage of the fact that avian cells genetically lack
PARP2 (35). Therefore, PARP1/ avian B-lymphoblast DT40
cells are equivalent to PARP1 and PARP2 double knockout (35).
Moreover, the catalytic domains and DNA-binding zinc ﬁnger
motifs are highly conserved between human and chicken
PARP1 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Because PARP1 and PAR levels
were undetectable in PARP1/ cells (Fig. 1A–C), and the PAR
level of wild-type cells treated with 0.1 mmol/L olaparib was as
low as in PARP1/ cells (Fig. 1C and 4B), we can compare
PARP deletion and catalytic PARP inhibition using PARP1/
cells and wild-type DT40 cells treated with olaparib. We tested
the sensitivity of wild-type, PARP1/, and BRCA2tr/ (BRCA2

or PARP2 (PARP1/; hPARP2; ref. 35). Complementation with
either hPARP1 or hPARP2 restored sensitivity to olaparib
(Fig. 3A), showing that both hPARP1 and hPARP2 can be
poisoned by olaparib.
In human DU145 prostate cancer cells, olaparib induced
chromatin binding of both PARP1 and PARP2 in the presence of
0.01% MMS (Fig. 3B, lanes 10–12). Trapping of PARP1 and
PARP2 was rapidly reversible upon drug removal (Fig. 3C) with
release of PARP1 and PARP2 from chromatin within 30 minutes. Dual trapping of PARP1 and PARP2 by olaparib was also
observed in other human cancer cells: OVCAR4 (ovarian cell
line) and SF295 (central nervous system; Supplementary Fig.
S3). Suppression of PARP1 expression level by siRNA reduced
the trapping of PARP1 but did not affect the trapping of PARP2
(Fig. 3D). Conversely, siRNA against PARP2 abolished the

www.aacrjournals.org

trapping of PARP2 by olaparib without affecting PARP1 trapping (Fig. 3D). Similar results were obtained in SF295 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S3B), showing that olaparib traps both
PARP1- and PARP2–DNA complexes independently of each
other.
Next, we tested whether genetic depletion of PARP1 or
PARP2 would make human cells tolerant to olaparib, as
observed in DT40 cells (see Fig. 1D). As expected, transfection
of DU145 cells with siRNA against PARP1 reduced sensitivity to
olaparib (Fig. 3E). However, siRNA against PARP2 had minimal
impact despite the efﬁciency of the knockdown (see Fig. 3D).
These results indicate that the presence of PARP1, whose
expression is much higher than PARP2 in human cells
(5, 37) is the major mediator of olaparib-induced antiproliferative activity in DU145 cells.

Differential potency of PARP inhibitors to poison PARP1
and PARP2 in cells
Having established the dual effect of olaparib on PARP
(catalytic inhibition and PARP trapping), we compared olaparib with 2 other clinically relevant PARP inhibitors, veliparib
and niraparib (see structures in Supplementary Fig. S1; ref. 27).
Catalytic PARP inhibition was examined by 2 methods (Western blotting and ELISA assays; refs. 34, 38). Both assays showed
that olaparib was the most potent catalytic PARP inhibitor,

3 drugs, PAR levels were almost undetectable at and above

In terms of cytotoxicity in wild-type DT40 cells, niraparib
was the most potent drug, whereas veliparib was the least
cytotoxic and olaparib was intermediate (Fig. 4C). The cytotoxicity was mediated by PARP1 as shown by the relative lack of
effect of the drugs in PARP1/ cells (Fig. 4D). Moreover, in the

required to synergize with MMS beyond the sensitivity of
PARP1/ cells, whereas for olaparib or niraparib, 1 mmol/L
(50-fold less) was enough to achieve superior synergism (Fig.
4E). These results suggested that veliparib had a lesser potency
to poison PARP1 than olaparib and niraparib. Despite its
minimal cytotoxicity in wild-type cells, veliparib sensitized
BRCA2tr/ cells, which is consistent with the general concept
of synthetic lethality by PARP inhibitors in BRCA-deﬁcient
tumors. Yet, veliparib was approximately 10-fold less cytotoxic
than olaparib in the BRCA2tr/ cells, and niraparib was even
more effective than olaparib as a single agent in the BRCA2tr/
cells (Fig. 4F).
The differential cytotoxicity of the 3 PARP inhibitors was
also observed in human DU145 cells (Fig. 4G and H). Single
treatment with either olaparib or niraparib killed DU145 in a
concentration-dependent manner, whereas veliparib had little
cytotoxicity (Fig. 4G). Under conditions in which 1 mmol/L
veliparib showed no effect, 1 mmol/L olaparib or niraparib
synergized markedly with MMS (Fig. 4H). Similar results were

www.aacrjournals.org

obtained in the human SF295 cell line (Supplementary Fig. S4A
and S4B). Therefore, the cytotoxicity of 3 clinically relevant
PARP inhibitors shows marked differences across different cell
lines with niraparib and olaparib being the most cytotoxic and
veliparib the least. Moreover, our results show that the antiproliferative activity of the PARP inhibitors, including in
BRCA2tr/ cells, is not directly correlated with their PARP
catalytic inhibition potencies.
We next tested whether the differential cytotoxicity of the
PARP inhibitors was related to their trapping of PARP1 and
PARP2. Even at 50 mmol/L, veliparib induced signiﬁcantly
less trapping of PARP1 and PARP2 on chromatin than
olaparib or niraparib at 10 mmol/L across different cell types
(DT40, human DU145 and SF295 cells; Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S4C). To examine the tightness of PARP–DNA
complexes induced by different PARP inhibitors, further
fractionation experiments were carried out (Fig. 5B and
C). Most of PARP1 was eluted in fraction B from untreated
or veliparib-treated cells, whereas it was mostly eluted in

fraction D in olaparib- and niraparib–treated cells. Histone
H3 and monoubiquitinated PCNA were also eluted dominantly in fraction D. These results indicate that PARP1–DNA
complexes trapped by olaparib and niraparib are tighter than
by veliparib. We also compared in our different assays, 4-AN,
a commonly used PARP inhibitor (32, 33, 39). Supplementary
Fig. S5 shows that its PARP poisoning potency was stronger
than veliparib, but was less than olaparib and niraparib,
whereas having similar catalytic PARP inhibitory ability as
niraparib. Together, these results show that PARP inhibitors
are not equivalent with respect to trapping PARP–DNA
complexes. Veliparib is the least potent poison of PARP1
and PARP2 at concentrations that are effectively blocking
PARP catalytic activity.

Differential potency of PARP inhibitors to poison PARP1
and PARP2 in biochemical assays
To elucidate whether the differential trapping of PARP–DNA
complexes by the 3 PARP inhibitors could be observed at the
molecular level, we set up a PARP1–DNA–binding assay based
on ﬂuorescence anisotropy. A nicked oligonucleotide duplex
DNA with a single 50 -dRP end at the break site was used as
ﬂuorescent substrate (Fig. 6A). Its anisotropy was enhanced
upon PARP1 binding to the damaged site. PARylation following
addition of NADþ reduced the ﬂuorescence anisotropy signal
by freeing the DNA. Figure 6B shows that all 3 PARP inhibitors
enhanced the ﬂuorescence anisotropy signal, which reﬂects
the stabilization of PARP1–DNA complexes. Olaparib and
niraparib were approximately 10-fold more potent than

veliparib. Time-course experiments following NADþ addition
(Fig. 6C) also showed that the PARP inhibitors slowed down
the dissociation of PARP1–DNA complexes with olaparib and
niraparib being signiﬁcantly more potent than veliparib. These
results are in agreement with the cellular data showing greater
stabilization of PARP–DNA complexes by olaparib and niraparib than by veliparib.
PARP–DNA complexes are repaired by several repair
pathways besides HR
To gain insight into the cellular repair pathways involved in
the repair of stabilized PARP1- and PARP2–DNA complexes,
we compared the sensitivity of 30 isogenic mutant DT40 cell
lines with preestablished genetic DNA repair deﬁciencies (Fig.
7A and Supplementary Table S1). An obvious difference
between the 3 PARP inhibitors was the resistance of
PARP1/ cell lines to olaparib and niraparib (light blue
in Fig. 7A), which is consistent with the requirement of PARP1
for the drugs cytotoxic activities (see above). As expected, the
HR-deﬁcient cell lines: BRCA2, XRCC3, XRCC2, BRCA1, RAD54,
and H2AX (dark blue in Fig. 7A) were hypersensitive to all 3
PARP inhibitors. The greater differential for veliparib (>16fold) is probably because of veliparib's low cytotoxicity in wildtype cells. Notably, deﬁciencies in check point including ATM
and RAD9 (light pink), postreplication repair pathways including PCNA ubiquitination and its ubiquitin ligases RAD18 and
UBC13 (brown), all FA genes tested (magenta), polymerase b
(orange), and FEN1 (purple) conferred greater than approximately 2-fold hypersensitivity to all 3 drugs, indicating that

DNA lesions induced by PARP inhibitors are not only repaired
by classic HR (see Discussion). Involvement of the FA pathway
was also inferred from enhanced monoubiquitination of
FANCD2, a key regulator of the pathway, in response to
olaparib (Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, deletion of
PARP1 in RAD18/ cells (40) restored their resistance to
olaparib and niraparib (Fig. 7A, compare RAD18 and
PARP1/RAD18), suggesting that toxic PARP–DNA complexes
but not catalytic inhibition of PARP kills RAD18/ cells with
defective postreplication repair.

Discussion
To our knowledge, our study provides the ﬁrst direct evidence that PARP inhibitors trap both PARP1- and PARP2–DNA
complexes. It shows the relevance of this mechanism for the
antiproliferative activity (and therefore anticancer activity) of
PARP inhibitors and provides novel insights into the molecular
pathways that repair PARP–DNA complexes. The clinical
relevance of our ﬁndings stems from the fact that the concentrations (<10 mmol/L) required to readily detect PARP1and PARP2–DNA complexes are below the peak concentration
of olaparib (24 mmol/L) in clinical trials (23).
Automodiﬁcation is a well-established mechanism by which
the highly negatively charged PAR polymers dissociate PARP
enzymes from DNA (41; Fig. 7B, step d). In addition, our data
show that PARP inhibitors differ in their potency to stabilize
PARP–DNA complexes irrespective of their relative potency to
inhibit PARP catalytic activity (see Fig 4, Supplementary Figs.

S4 and S5). Indeed, PARP–DNA complexes were detectable
under conditions in which PAR automodiﬁcation remained
detectable (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Figs. S3 and S4C). Similarly,
a recent study showed that nuclear PARylation was observed
even after treatment with 10 mmol/L veliparib with MMS (42).
Therefore, we propose that PARP inhibitors poison PARP by 2
mechanisms. One is by inhibition of PARylation, which
increases the binding of PARP to DNA (Fig. 7B, annotations
1, c, and d; refs. 41, 43); the other is drug binding to the NADþ
site, which allosterically enhances the DNA binding of PARP's
N-terminal zinc ﬁnger domain (Fig. 7B, annotations 2 and e).
The drug allosteric mechanism ﬁts with the greater potency of
the bulky inhibitors, niraparib and olaparib to produce PARP–
DNA complexes as compared with veliparib and 4-AN (see
Supplementary Fig. S1). This hypothetical reverse allosteric
mechanism is supported by the fact that tight binding of
PARP's N-terminus zinc domain to damaged DNA (Fig. 7B,
step a) is known to allosterically activate the C-terminal
catalytic pocket of PARP (1–3, 42, 44; Fig. 7B, step b). Hence,
the PARP inhibitors can be viewed as blocking with the normal
allosteric cycle of PARP and as revealing the normal impact of
NADþ binding to PARP. PARP binding to damaged DNA might
be normally primed by NADþ binding. In turn, PARP binding to
damaged DNA induces the known allosteric change that
activates PARP's catalytic site (44). The allosteric enhancement
of PARP–DNA binding by PARP inhibitors is likely to be more
signiﬁcant for the anticancer activity of PARP inhibitors than
catalytic inhibition. Indeed, while PARP1/ DT40 cells overexpressing catalytic inactive PARP1 are mildly more sensitive
to MMS than PARP1/ cells (45), we ﬁnd that olaparib, under
conditions that induce PARP–DNA complexes, produces a

5596

Cancer Res; 72(21) November 1, 2012

much more drastic hypersensitivity to MMS than PARP/
cells (Fig. 2C).
Our experiments clearly show that PARP inhibitors that
were assumed to be equivalent based on PARP catalytic
inhibition, are not equivalent with respect to their potency to
poison PARP, suggesting the importance of categorizing PARP
inhibitors according to their PARP poisoning potency. Depending on which PARP inhibitor is used, the clinical and experimental results could be very different. Furthermore, this
persistent tendency to confuse different PARP inhibitors would
make it impossible for the others to recapitulate the results
depending on which PARP inhibitor was used. Therefore, our
ﬁndings are relevant to basic researcher and clinicians who use
PARP inhibitors. Speciﬁcally, our ﬁndings uniquely explain
why veliparib has much lower toxicity than olaparib and
niraparib although the 3 drugs have similar potency to inhibit
PARP catalytic activity.
Our DT40 cell panel data conﬁrm the critical importance of
HRs including BRCA1 and BRCA2. They are consistent with the
lethality of PARP1 siRNAs or short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in
BRCA-deﬁcient cells (21, 22) and with the activity of olaparib in
BRCA-deﬁcient tumors (23). BRCA2tr/PARP1/ double
mutant DT40 cells are also unviable (unpublished data). These
lines of evidence strongly support the current anticancer selectivity of PARP inhibitors based on the interference with SSB
repair (Fig. 7C, upper pathway). On the other hand, in the case of
the RAD18/ cells, their sensitivity to the PARP inhibitors is
unambiguously derived from the trapping of toxic PARP–DNA
complexes (Fig. 7C, lower pathway) rather than from catalytic
PARP inhibition, as the hypersensitivity of the RAD18/ cells
was rescued in RAD18/PARP1/ double mutant DT40 cells.

Our present data (Fig. 7A) add XRCC2, XRCC3, RAD54, and
H2AX to the list of HR genes that confer high sensitivity to
PARP inhibitors. The hypersensitivity of check point–deﬁcient
cells (ATM/ and RAD9/) and the resistance of nonhomologous end joining–deﬁcient cells (KU70/ and LIGASE IV/)
extend recent reports (46, 47). The hypersensitivity of FEN1 and
polymerase b–deﬁcient cells may imply involvement of BER
pathway or increase of endogenous DNA damage in these cells.
RAD18 and UBC13, which are both responsible for PCNA
ubiquitination on lysine 164 (48, 49), were identiﬁed in our
DT40 panel as novel genes for survival to PARP inhibitors.
Consistently, the PCNA mutant K164R also showed hypersensitivity to all 3 PARP inhibitors. PCNA ubiquitination has been
proposed to play a central role in postreplication repair that
uses translesion synthesis (TLS) and template switching to
bypass bulky DNA lesions. For the repair of PARP–DNA lesion,
template switching seems more important than TLS because
the representative TLS polymerases, POLZ and POLH, mutant
cells do not show apparent sensitivity to all drugs. The FA
pathway seems critical for the repair of PARP–DNA complexes
(see Supplementary Fig. S6). These results could rationalize the
use of PARP inhibitors in tumors with deﬁciencies in the genes
listed earlier.
In summary, this is the ﬁrst report showing the toxic PARP–
DNA complex by PARP inhibitors, and the greatly different
potency to poison PARP among clinical PARP inhibitors
irrespective of the potency to inhibit PARP catalytic activity.
It also reveals new genetic repair pathways that are critical for
the repair of PARP–DNA complexes, and potential synthetic
lethality, which can be exploited for additional clinical use of
PARP inhibitors.
