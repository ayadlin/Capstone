Abstract
Malignant cells express ligands for the natural killer cell immunoreceptor NKG2D, which sensitizes to early
recognition and elimination by cytotoxic lymphocytes and provides an innate barrier against tumor
development. However, the mechanisms that control NKG2D ligand (NKG2DL) expression in tumor cells
remain unknown. We recently identiﬁed the NKG2DL ULBP2 as strong prognostic marker in human
malignant melanoma. Here, we provide evidence that the tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNA) miR34a and miR-34c control ULBP2 expression. Reporter gene analyses revealed that both miRNAs directly
targeted the 30 -untranslated region of ULBP2 mRNA and that levels of miR-34a inversely correlated with
expression of ULBP2 surface molecules. Accordingly, treatment of cancer cells with miRNA inhibitors led
to upregulation of ULBP2, whereas miR-34 mimics led to downregulation of ULBP2, diminishing tumor cell
recognition by NK cells. Treatment with the small molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3a also decreased ULBP2 levels
in a p53-dependent manner, which was due to a p53-mediated increase in cellular miR-34 levels. Taken
together, our study shows that tumor-suppressive miR-34a and miR-34c act as ULBP2 repressors. These
ﬁndings also implicate p53 in ULBP2 regulation, emphasizing the role of the speciﬁc NKG2DL in tumor
immune surveillance. Cancer Res; 72(2); 460–71. 2011 AACR.

Introduction
NKG2D is a receptor of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTL), involved in the detection of abnormal
self, as it occurs upon infection or malignant transformation.
Ligands of NKG2D are surface molecules, structurally related
to classical MHC class I molecules that in humans belong to
either the MIC (MICA, MICB) or the ULBP (ULBP1-6) molecule
family (1). The importance of the NKG2D receptor-ligand
system for the recognition and suppression of tumors has
clearly been shown in different mouse models (2–7). Tumor
cells modiﬁed to express NKG2D ligands (NKG2DL), when

grafted into mice, were rejected while nonmodiﬁed cells
formed tumors (2–4). Evidence for an involvement of NKG2D
in early immune surveillance of malignancies was provided by
Raulet and colleagues who observed an increased incidence of
spontaneous tumors in NKG2D-deﬁcient mice (6). Accordingly, Unni and colleagues reported an early induction of NKG2DL
surface expression during spontaneous murine tumorigenesis
(5).
In humans, NKG2DL have been detected on tumor cells from
different entities, sensitizing them to killing by NK cells and
CTLs (8–10). Cancer cells often express a variety of NKG2DL,
like melanoma cells that show a predominant expression of
MICA and ULBP2 detectable in vitro and in situ (10–12).
However, tumor cells can escape from NKG2D immune surveillance by an enhanced proteolytic shedding of NKG2DL (13–
15). This shedding is most likely causative for the increased
levels of soluble ligands in sera of cancer patients (16–18).
Recently, we identiﬁed elevated levels of soluble ULBP2 in sera
from melanoma patients as strong independent predictor of
poor prognosis (12).
Despite the importance of NKG2DL in tumor immune
surveillance, the mechanisms that control their expression
in cancer cells are largely unknown. In general, NKG2DL
surface expression is elicited under conditions associated
with cellular stress like infection, heat shock and DNA
damage (19–21). Notably, mRNA expression of NKG2DL has
been detected in several normal tissues that, however, lack
NKG2DL proteins, pointing toward a tight regulation of

NKG2D Ligand Regulation

mRNA translation (1, 22). MicroRNAs (miRNA) recently
emerged as central regulators of mRNA degradation and/or
translation (23), involved in the control of different fundamental biological processes. miRNAs are noncoding small
RNAs of 20 to 23 nucleotide length, binding to complementary sequences within the 30 -untranslated region (30 -UTR) of
speciﬁc mRNAs (23).
Our observation on ULBP2 as a strong prognostic marker in
malignant melanoma prompted us to study its regulation in
tumor cells that so far remained elusive. Focusing on posttranscriptional mechanisms, we provide evidence herein that
members of the tumor-suppressive miR-34 family directly
control ULBP2 expression. Furthermore, our data also
point to p53 as a regulator of ULBP2 indicating that different
tumor suppressors are involved in the control of this speciﬁc
NKG2DL.

Materials and Methods
Cells
Melanoma cell lines UKRV-Mel-02, UKRV-Mel-15a, Mel592
have been described (10, 24), Ma-Mel-48a, Ma-Mel-47, Ma-Mel123, and Ma-Mel-100a were established from tumor metastases. Patient tumor samples were collected after written
informed consent. Studies on human material were approved
by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medicine
Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). HCT116 p53þ/þ and
HCT116 p53/ cells were kindly provided by Bert Vogelstein
(John Hopkins University). All cell lines were cultured in RPMI
1640 or Dulbecco's modiﬁed Eagle's medium supplemented
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS).
Plasmid constructs and reagents
Different fragments of the ULBP2 30 -UTR were ampliﬁed by PCR from cDNA of Ma-Mel-47 cells and subsequently cloned into the dual luciferase vector psiCHECK2
(Promega), leading to the following constructs: pULBP23.1 (complete ULBP2 30 -UTR), pULBP2-3.2 (proximal half
of the 30 -UTR with miR-34–binding site) and pULBP2-3.3
(distal half of the 30 -UTR, no miR-34–binding site). Sitespeciﬁc mutation of the miR-34–binding site in pULBP23.1 was carried out with the QuikChange Lightning SiteDirected Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), yielding the construct pULBP2-3.1 Mut. Primers used for ampliﬁcation
and site-speciﬁc mutagenesis are listed in Supplementary
Table S1. The miScript miRNA mimics and Allstars control siRNA were purchased from Qiagen (Supplementary
Table S2) and used at concentrations of 2.5 nmol/L (for
HEK293, UKRV-Mel-02) and 20-40 nmol/L (for UKRV-Mel15a). A speciﬁc, chemically modiﬁed single-strand nucleic
acid Anti-miR miRNA inhibitor for inhibition of endogenous miR-34a activity and a control inhibitor (Anti-miR
miRNA inhibitor, negative control #1) were obtained from
Ambion (Applied Biosystems) and used at a concentration
of 150 nmol/L. Transfer of plasmids, miRNA mimics and
miRNA inhibitors was carried out with the transfection
reagents Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The MDM2

www.aacrjournals.org

inhibitor Nutlin-3a (Cayman Chemical) was added to the
culture medium at indicated concentrations, control cells
were treated with the solvent only.
Luciferase assay
HEK293 cells, seeded into 6-well plates, were cotransfected
with 1 mg of the reporter gene constructs (pULBP2-3.1,
pULBP2-3.2, pULBP2-3.3, pULBP2-3.1 Mut) and 2.5 nmol/L of
miScript miRNA mimics. After 48 hours, cells were lysed and
analyzed for Renilla and Fireﬂy luciferase activity using the
Dual-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega). Each transfectant
was assayed in triplicates. Activity of Renilla luciferase was
normalized to Fireﬂy luciferase.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR
Total miRNA and mRNA were isolated from tumor cells
using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), according to the protocol of the manufacturer. Reverse transcription of miRNA was
carried out with the Taqman MicroRNA Assay kit, mRNA
was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the High Capacity
cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). Realtime PCR was carried out using speciﬁc TaqMan Gene
Expression assays or miRNA assays in combination with the
StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems).
Relative RNA expression was calculated by the 2DDCt method
after normalizing expression levels of ULBP2 mRNA to
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA
and miRNA to RNU6B.
Western blot
Tumor cells were lysed in RIPA buffer. Nuclear proteins were
isolated using the Nuclear Extract Kit (Active Motif). Proteins
were separated by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and probed with the following primary antihuman antibodies: ULBP2 (AF1298, R&D Systems); p53 (DO-1
sc-126), p21 (F-5 sc-6246), and Sp1 (1C6 sc-420) all from Santa
Cruz, b-tubulin (#2146) from Cell Signaling. After washing,
membranes were probed with the appropriate secondary
antibodies linked to horseradish peroxidase. Antibody binding
was visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence system.
Band intensities were quantiﬁed by using ImageJ software.
DNA binding ELISA for activated p53
Nuclear protein extracts from different cell lines were assayed for the DNA binding capacity of p53 using the TransAM p53
Kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (Active Motif).
Flow cytometry
For analysis of MICA and ULBP2 surface expression, melanoma cells were incubated with anti-MICA mAb AMO1 and
anti-ULBP2 mAb BUMO1 (18), followed by staining with a Cy5conjugated goat anti-mouse F(ab')2 (Dianova). Background
ﬂuorescence was determined by staining with the secondary
antibody only. After ﬁxation, cells were analyzed employing the
Gallios (Beckman Coulter) and the FlowJo software. ULBP2
expression was determined as mean ﬂuorescence intensity
(MFI) and normalized to the background MFI (secondary
antibody only).

miR-34a/miR-34c and miR-449a/miR-449c bind to the
30 -UTR of ULBP2 mRNA
To address whether cellular miRNAs are involved in
the regulation of ULBP2 expression, we screened the 30 UTR of ULBP2 mRNA for conserved miRNA-binding sites.
The TargetScan database predicted binding of miR-34
family members, miR-34a and miR-34c-5p, to the 30 -UTR
of ULBP2 (Fig. 1A). This miRNA family, consisting of miR34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c, is known for its tumor-suppressive activity by inducing cell-cycle arrest, senescence
or apoptosis upon ectopic expression in malignant cells
(25). To evaluate the role of miR-34 in the regulation of
ULBP2 expression, we ﬁrst generated reporter gene constructs, fusing the ULBP2 30 -UTR downstream to a luciferase reporter gene, yielding the construct pULBP2-3.1
(Fig. 1A). Furthermore, 2 deletion variants of pULBP2-3.1
were generated, one encompassing the proximal half of

between experimental groups the 2-tailed Student t test was
carried out using the GraphPad Prism 5.03 software (GraphPad). We report Spearman correlations as measurement of
correlations between ULBP2 cell surface expression and
miRNA levels, using SPSS v.17. Experimental groups
were considered to be signiﬁcantly different at levels a of
<5% (P < 0.05, indicated by  ), of <1% (P < 0.01, indicated

Cytotoxicity assay
Killing of melanoma cells was determined in a ﬂow
cytometry assay. Therefore, melanoma cells (1  106
cells/mL) were labeled with 20 nmol/L CFSE (Invitrogen).
After 10 minutes, labeling was stopped by the addition of
FCS. In parallel, IL-2 activated enriched CD3CD56þ NK
cells were incubated for 30 minutes with either mouse IgG1
or mouse anti-human NKG2D antibody. Then NK cells were
added to 5  104 CFSE-labeled melanoma cells at the
indicated effector to target ratios. After 3 hours of coculture
7-AAD (BD Bioscience) was added to each sample at a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mg/mL. Probes were measured directly by
ﬂow cytometry. The gating strategy used for analysis is
indicated in Supplementary Fig. S2.

miR-34–binding site, and a second overlapping construct
containing the distal half without the miR-34–binding site
(pULBP2-3.3; Fig. 1A).
These reporter constructs were then transfected into
HEK293 cells together with the various synthetic miR-34
mimics. Though not highly predicted, we also included miR34b (miR-34b ) in our studies, to test all miR-34 family members. Transfection of pULBP2-3.1 in combination with the
miRNA mimics revealed a clear reduction of luciferase activity
for miR-34a and miR-34c, whereas miR-34b only slightly
reduced reporter gene expression (Fig. 1B). In case of
pULBP2-3.2, the negative effects of miR-34a and miR-34c on
reporter gene expression were even more pronounced. In
contrast, the speciﬁc miRNAs did not negatively inﬂuence the
activity of the pULBP2-3.3 construct lacking the predicted miR34–binding site (Fig. 1B).
Besides the miR-34 family, the TargetScan database
predicted also binding of different members of the miR-449
family to the 30 -UTR of ULBP2 (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the
miR-34 and miR-449 families are structurally related
and share the same seed sequence and like miR-34 also
miR-449 has been described to be involved in the control
of cell proliferation (26). Although the TargetScan program predicted only binding of miR-449a and miR-449b,
we additionally included miR-449c in our studies. Transfection experiments revealed that miR-449a and miR-449c

was added to the NK cells 30 minutes before coincubation
with target cells. After coculture for 1 hour, cells were
incubated in the presence of 2 mmol/L Monensin (Sigma-Aldrich) for additional 3 hours to inhibit CD107a
internalization. Thereafter cells were washed and stained
with additional ﬂuorescence labeled mAbs. After ﬁxation,
cells were analyzed by ﬂow cytometry employing the
Kaluza (Beckman Coulter) and FlowJo software. The gating
strategy used for analysis is indicated in Supplementary
Fig. S1.

transfection of miR-34 and miR-449 mimics. Data of normalized Renilla

miR-34 and miR-449 family members are involved in the
control of ULBP2 expression by binding to the 30 -UTR of
its mRNA.

To conﬁrm the functional signiﬁcance of the speciﬁc
miRNA-binding motif, a nucleotide substitution was introduced into the miR-34/miR-449 seed sequence-binding site of
pULBP2-3.1, resulting in pULBP2-3.1 Mut (Fig. 2A). Indeed, this
mutation abrogated the negative effect of miR-34a/miR-34c
and miR-449a/miR-449c mimics on reporter gene expression
(Fig. 2B and C).

Diminished NK cell recognition of miR-34–transfected
melanoma cells
In the following, we determined the inﬂuence of ULBP2
downregulation on the recognition of melanoma cells by
NK cells. These functional analyses were carried out on the
MICA-negative UKRV-Mel-15a cells (Supplementary Fig. S4)
characterized by the lowest endogenous miR-34 levels of all
melanoma cell lines tested. Upon transfection of the miR34c mimic into UKRV-Mel-15a, a reduction of more than
50% in ULBP2 surface expression was observed in comparison with control siRNA-treated cells (Fig. 5A). The transfected tumor cells were then analyzed for their capacity to
stimulate NK cells. Activation of NK cells was measured by
surface expression of the degranulation marker CD107a. As
shown in Fig. 5B, maximal NK degranulation was observed
in the presence of control siRNA-transfected target cells.

miR-34a and miR-34c control ULBP2 expression
Focusing on the regulation of ULBP2 by miR-34, we ﬁrst
transfected speciﬁc miRNA mimics into UKRV-Mel-02 cells.
Transfection efﬁciency was veriﬁed by qRT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3). Western blot analysis of total cell lysates from
transfectants showed that both miRNAs, in contrast to control
siRNA, downregulated ULBP2 protein expression (Fig. 4A).
This downregulation was associated with a reduction in ULBP2
mRNA levels, suggesting that transfected miR-34a and miR-34c
mimics induced degradation of the speciﬁc mRNA, though an
impact on translation could not be excluded (Fig. 4B). The

strongest inhibitory effect on target expression was exerted by
miR-34c, as already observed in reporter gene assays (Fig. 1B).
Next, we asked for the impact of endogenous miR-34a on
the expression level of the speciﬁc NKG2DL in melanoma
cells. To decrease endogenous miR-34a levels, Ma-Mel-47
cells were transfected with a speciﬁc miR-34a inhibitor
(anti–miR-34a) in comparison with a control inhibitor. As
shown in Fig. 4C and D, downregulation of cellular miR-34a
in Ma-Mel-47 cells clearly increased the expression of the
ULBP2 protein.

Inverse correlation between expression levels of miR-34a
and ULBP2 surface molecules
To asses a role of endogenous miR-34a/miR-34c and
miR-449a/miR-449c in the regulation of ULBP2 expression,
different melanoma cell lines were studied in parallel for their
expression levels of ULBP2 surface molecules and speciﬁc
miRNAs. All cell lines showed signiﬁcant but variable surface
expression of ULBP2 (Fig. 3A and B). Although miR-449a and
miR-449c were not detectable (data not shown), several melanoma cell lines expressed miR-34a but only 1 out of the 8
contained miR-34c (Fig. 3C). Statistical analysis revealed a
signiﬁcant inverse correlation between expression levels of
endogenous miR-34a and ULBP2 surface molecules (rs ¼
0.95;  , P < 0.01; Fig. 3D), again pointing toward an involvement of miR-34 in ULBP2 regulation.

This stimulation was strongly reduced in the presence of an
anti-NKG2D blocking antibody, indicating the dependency
of efﬁcient NK cell activation from NKG2D receptor signaling. Tumor cells transfected with miR-34c mimics
showed signiﬁcantly lower NK cell stimulatory capacity
than control cells. The low residual expression of ULBP2
on miR-34c–transfected melanoma cells only slightly stimulated NK cells as indicated by NKG2D receptor blockade.
The downregulation of ULBP2 also inﬂuenced the cytolytic
activity NK cells as showed in a ﬂow cytometry-based
CFSE/7-AAD cytotoxicity assay. Similar to the CD107a
degranulation assay, lysis of miR-34c mimic-transfected
cells was signiﬁcantly reduced compared with control
siRNA-transfected cells (Fig. 5C). In summary, these data
clearly showed the functional signiﬁcance of ULBP2 downregulation by miR-34.
miR-34 contributes to the downregulation of ULBP2
induced by Nutlin-3a
Next, we asked how an induction of endogenous miR-34
levels would inﬂuence ULBP2 expression in melanoma cells.

Therefore, Ma-Mel-47 cells were treated with the small
molecule inhibitor Nutlin-3a. As an inhibitor of MDM2,
Nutlin-3a has been shown to activate p53 (27) that in turn
induces transcription of the miR-34 genes (28). We conﬁrmed activation of p53 in Nutlin-3a treated Ma-Mel-47 cells
by showing an induction of the p53 target gene p21 and
measuring the DNA binding capacity of p53 (Fig. 6A
and Supplementary Fig. S5). As expected, in response to
Nutlin-3a, Ma-Mel-47 cells increased the expression of miR34a and miR-34c (Fig. 6B). Although the calculated increase
was much higher for miR-34c, its absolute expression level
was still far below that of miR-34a.
As shown in Fig. 6C, Nutlin-3a treatment reduced ULBP2
protein expression in melanoma cells. To show an involvement
of miR-34a in this process, Ma-Mel-47 cells were treated in
parallel with Nutlin-3a and anti–miR-34a. Indeed, anti–miR34a transfection increased ULBP2 protein expression in Nutlin3a–treated tumor cells, indicating that miR-34 still acts on the
ULBP2 30 -UTR under these conditions. However, transfection
of anti–miR-34a into Nutlin-3a–treated tumor cells could not
restore ULBP2 expression to levels of untreated control cells

p53 activity is essential for ULBP2 downregulation in
Nutlin-3a–treated tumor cells
To clarify the role of p53 in Nutlin-3a mediated downregulation of ULBP2, we took advantage of the colon carcinoma HCT116 p53þ/þ and HCT116 p53/ cell system.
Activation of p53 upon Nutlin-3a treatment of HCT116 p53þ/
þ
cells was again conﬁrmed by p21 expression and measurement of p53 DNA capacity (Supplementary Fig. S5 and
S6). Indeed, only HCT116 p53þ/þ cells showed a downregulation of ULBP2, detectable at the level of total cellular
protein (Fig. 7A and B) and cell surface protein (Fig. 7D

(no transfection, no Nutlin-3a), suggesting that Nutlin-3a
downregulated ULBP2 protein expression by additional regulatory mechanisms.
Interestingly, in Nutlin-3a–treated melanoma cells ULBP2
mRNA levels remained unchanged in comparison with control cells, despite the induction of miR-34. This contrasts the
results obtained upon transfection of miR-34 mimics into
melanoma cells, where downregulation of ULBP2 protein
expression was associated with a decrease in its mRNA levels
(Fig. 4B). One cannot exclude a concentration-dependent
effect, as speciﬁc miRNA levels in transfected cells were
much higher than in Nutlin-3a–treated cells. However, the
discrepancy might also be explained by different regulatory
mechanisms that act on ULBP2 mRNA in the presence of
Nutlin-3a.

contained strongly enhanced levels of miR-34a and miR-34c
in comparison with HCT116 p53/ cells (Fig. 7C). Again, we
measured constant mRNA levels for ULBP2 under Nutlin-3a
treatment (Fig. 7C).

Discussion
The NKG2D receptor allows cytotoxic lymphocytes to detect
cellular stress associated with malignant transformation,
which in turn can lead to tumor rejection as showed in several
mouse studies (2–7). Interestingly, the human NKG2DL ULBP2
was identiﬁed as a marker of remarkable prognostic relevance
in different tumor entities (12, 29). We found elevated levels of
shed soluble ULBP2 in sera from melanoma patients to be
associated with poor survival, as this was in the following also
described for B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients
(12, 29). Ligand shedding protects malignant cells from
NKG2D-mediated immune surveillance (13–15), which in turn
could favor tumor progression. This observation prompted us
to ask for the regulation of ULBP2 in malignant cells. Although
it has been shown that DNA damaging agents and proteasome
inhibitors induce ULBP2 expression (19, 30), the underlying
molecular mechanisms and in particular the role of tumor
suppressors in the regulation of this speciﬁc NKG2DL
remained elusive so far.

In this study, we provide evidence that members of the miR34 family, miR-34a and miR-34c, repress ULBP2 expression by
directly binding to the 30 -UTR of the speciﬁc mRNA. A different
subset of cellular miRNAs has already been shown to control
expression of the MIC molecules suggesting that miRNAs are
important players in NKG2DL regulation (31–33). Interestingly, via miR-34 we link the control of ULBP2 expression to a
miRNA with tumor-suppressive activity. It has been shown that
ectopic expression of miR-34 family members in malignant
cells promotes cell-cycle arrest, senescence or apoptosis (25).
According to its tumor-suppressive function, several protooncogenes have been identiﬁed as direct targets of miR-34a
and miR-34c, such as c-Myc and c-Met (34–36). In addition,
recent studies indicated that miR-34a and miR-34c are upregulated during cellular differentiation (37–39). Besides miR-

34a and miR-34c, we showed binding also of miR-449a and
miR-449c to the 30 -UTR of ULBP2. The miR-34 and miR-449
families share the same seed sequence and notably, similar to
miR-34a, miR-449a has been described to mediate antiproliferative effects and to be involved in cellular differentiation
(26, 40, 41).
In our cohort of metastatic melanoma cell lines, miR-449a
and miR-449c were not detectable and thus we did not follow
up on their role in ULBP2 regulation. Also expression of miR34c was rare according to its detection in only a few normal
tissues such as lung, testis (39, 42), but several melanoma cell
lines contained signiﬁcant amounts of miR-34a. Notably, we
observed an inverse correlation between levels of miR-34a and
ULBP2 surface molecules. Recently, Lodygin and colleagues
described a downregulation of miR-34a by epigenetic silencing

mechanisms in melanoma and also in other tumor entities
(43). In comparison to melanocytes the authors found miR-34a
expression to be silenced in 20 of 32 primary melanoma
specimens and 19 of 44 melanoma cell lines and suggested
this to be a mechanism of tumors to prevent cell-cycle arrest
and apoptosis (43). Importantly, miR-34-low melanoma cells,
upon ectopic expression of miR-34a or miR-34c, strongly
downregulated ULBP2. This led to an impairment of tumor
cell recognition by NK cells emphasizing the functional signiﬁcance of the regulatory mechanism. The decrease of ULBP2
in response to transfection of miR-34 mimics was detectable at
the speciﬁc protein and mRNA level. This suggests that miR34a and miR-34c by binding to the 30 -UTR of ULBP2 mRNA
enhance its degradation, though we cannot absolutely exclude
a contribution of indirect miR-34 effects on ULBP2 mRNA
levels, for example, by interference with ULBP2 promoter
activity.
Besides ectopic miR-34 expression, treatment of melanoma
cells with Nutlin-3a downregulated ULBP2 in a p53-dependent
manner. Nutlin-3a, by binding to MDM2, blocks ubiquitination
of the tumor suppressor p53, which leads to p53 accumulation
and activation in the absence of genotoxic stress (27, 28, 44, 45).
Although our results point to p53 as negative regulator of
ULBP2, its role seems to be much more complex. Previously,
Gasser and colleagues showed an induction of ULBP2 expression in response to DNA damage in HCT116 p53þ/þ and
HCT116 p53/ cells indicating that under these conditions
activated p53 neither downregulated ULBP2 nor was it
required for NKG2DL induction (19). But a recent study by
Textor and colleagues showed that an inducible overexpression of p53 in genetically modiﬁed cells activates ULBP2
transcription (46). Thus, we assume that the outcome of
p53 activation on ULBP2 expression depends on the context
of its activation, pointing to a multifaceted role of p53 that
awaits further investigation.
p53 has been described as an important activator of
miR-34a and miR-34b/c gene expression in several studies
(28, 42, 47, 48). Accordingly, we observed a p53-dependent
induction of cellular miR-34 levels in response to Nutlin-3a.
The miRNA increase contributed to the downregulation of
ULBP2 that could be partially counteracted by transfection
of a miR-34a–speciﬁc inhibitor. Unexpectedly, despite the
increase of cellular miR-34 levels, the amount of ULBP2
mRNA remained constant suggesting that under these
conditions binding of miR-34 to the 30 -UTR of ULBP2
mRNA mainly affected the process of translation. Indeed,
1 miRNA can control 1 speciﬁc target mRNA by repression

of translation and degradation, however, the question on
the relative contribution of the different modes of target
regulation is still under intense investigation (23). Very
recently the group of Hermeking showed that miR-34a
affects the majority of its target mRNAs by degradation
and translational repression, with a few targets controlled
at the level of translation only (49). Thus, miR-34a most
likely affects both, ULBP2 mRNA translation and degradation. Why in Nutlin-3a–treated tumor cells, despite the
induction of miR-34, ULBP2 mRNA levels remained constant is unclear. It is tempting to speculate that Nutlin-3a
by blockade of MDM2 not only activates p53 but also
additional regulators that might contribute to the control
of ULBP2 mRNA levels. Interestingly, it has already been
shown that the repressive activity of miRNA can be modulated by RNA-binding proteins (50).
On the basis of our data and the current knowledge about
the miR-34 family, we assume that high levels of miR-34,
present in differentiated tissues, interfere with ULBP2 protein
expression, whereas loss of miR-34a/miR-34c expression, as it
frequently occurs in cancer, might assist tumor immune
surveillance by enhancing ULBP2 expression. In summary, our
data show that different tumor suppressors play a central
role in ULBP2 regulation, strengthening the model of the
NKG2D receptor-ligand system as a barrier against tumor
development.
