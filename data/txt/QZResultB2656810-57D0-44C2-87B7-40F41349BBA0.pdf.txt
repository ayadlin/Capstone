The Stress Kinase p38a as a Target
for Cancer Therapy
Ana Igea1 and Angel R. Nebreda1,2

Abstract
p38a is a ubiquitous protein kinase strongly activated by stress
signals, inﬂammatory cytokines, and many other stimuli, which
has been implicated in the modulation of multiple cellular
processes. There is good evidence in the literature that p38a plays
an important tumor-suppressor role by interfering with malignant cell transformation. This is mainly based on the ability of the
p38a pathway to regulate tissue homeostasis by integrating
signals that balance cell proliferation and differentiation or
induce apoptosis. However, recent reports have also illustrated

protumorigenic functions for p38a. Thus, p38a signaling may
facilitate the survival and proliferation of tumor cells contributing
to the progression of some tumor types. In addition, p38a
activation helps tumor cells to survive chemotherapeutic treatments. In all these cases, the inhibition of p38a has a potential
therapeutic interest. Further elucidation of the context-dependent
functions of p38a signaling in tumoral processes is of obvious
importance for the use of inhibitors of this pathway in cancer
therapy. Cancer Res; 75(19); 3997–4002. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

microenvironment that not only contributes to primary tumor
growth, for example by promoting neovascularization, but may
facilitate dissemination of tumor cells as well as the metastatic
process at large. These interactions involve secreted signaling
molecules such as transforming growth factor b (TGFb) and
interleukin-6 (3). Thus, different steps of tumorigenesis involve
substantial changes in the signaling pathways of several cell types.
Initial studies addressing the function of p38a were mainly
based on the use of small-molecule chemical inhibitors. More
recently, the use of RNAi technologies, the generation of mice with
genetic inactivation of speciﬁc p38 MAPK family members, and
the development of more potent and speciﬁc chemical inhibitors
have allowed a better characterization of the contribution of p38a
to particular cellular processes. Here, we will focus on p38a
signaling in tumor cells and will review data indicating that
p38a may either facilitate or interfere with tumor development,
depending on the context.

The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling
pathway plays important roles in the ability of cells to integrate
external stimuli and elaborate appropriate responses. This pathway plays a key role in the stress response, but inﬂammatory
cytokines and many different non-stress stimuli can also activate
p38 MAPK signaling, leading to the regulation of numerous
cellular processes.
Four p38 MAPK family members have been identiﬁed: p38a,
p38b, p38g, and p38d. p38a is ubiquitously expressed usually at
high levels, whereas p38b is expressed at lower levels. The expression patterns of p38g and p38d are more restricted. Most of the
functions that are generally ascribed to p38 MAPKs actually refer
to p38a, which is encoded by the MAPK14 gene. More than 100
proteins can be directly phosphorylated by p38a and a signiﬁcant
proportion of them is involved in the regulation of gene expression (1, 2). In addition, the p38a pathway can control at different
levels the production of extracellular signaling molecules, such as
cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors (3).
Deregulation of protein kinase signaling underlies many
human pathologies. Cancer is a complex disease that arises
through a multistep, mutagenic process, which inevitably
involves changes in the wiring of signaling pathways that are
normally tightly regulated to maintain tissue homeostasis. The
mutations sometimes affect protein kinases directly involved in
promoting cancer cell growth. However, tumor development also
involves interactions of the tumor cells with the surrounding

Tumor Formation
The p38a signaling pathway has been classically considered a
tumor suppressor, mainly based on its ability to negatively
regulate proliferation and induce differentiation of several cell
types. Despite the relevance of p38a signaling in tumor suppression, inactivating mutations of p38a have not been consistently
identiﬁed in human tumors. This probably reﬂects that cancer
cells can beneﬁt from the versatility of this signaling pathway to
control multiple cellular processes. In line with this idea, recent
reports have provided evidence for a dual role of p38a in several
cancer types (Fig. 1).
Breast
There is evidence that p38 MAPK suppresses breast tumor
initiation. For example, Wip1-knockout mice show reduced
breast tumorigenesis upon expression of oncogenes, which correlates with higher p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and the p38
MAPK inhibitor SB203580 abolishes the effect of Wip1 deﬁciency
in tumorigenesis (4). However, treatment with the p38 MAPK

In vivo roles of p38a in tumorigenesis based on mouse models. As a tumor suppressor (green), an important function of p38a is to regulate tissue homeostasis
by balancing cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. But p38a can also function as a tumor promoter (red), facilitating tumor cell survival and dissemination.

inhibitor LY2228820 reduces tumor growth in xenografts of
human breast cancer cell lines (5), and the p38 MAPK inhibitor
PH797804 impairs the growth of breast tumors induced by
polyoma middle T (PyMT) expression in mice (6). Moreover,
high levels of active p38 MAPK have been correlated with poor
prognosis, lymph node metastasis, and tamoxifen resistance in
breast cancer patients (3), supporting a role for p38a in breast
tumor progression.
Colon
p38a regulates intestinal homeostasis and the integrity of the
colon epithelia. Downregulation of p38a in intestinal epithelial
cells increases proliferation, reduces the number of mucus-producing goblet cells and affects epithelial barrier function by
altering tight junction assembly (7, 8). As a consequence, mice
with p38a-deﬁcient intestinal epithelial cells are more susceptible
to colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis (7). In contrast, downregulation of p38a in colon tumor cells or pharmacologic inhibition using PH797804 reduces tumor burden in mice (7).
Treatment with the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 also reduces

colon tumor growth either in xenografts of human colon cancer
cell lines or in mice that express APCmin (9). These results support
that p38a facilitates colon tumor progression.
Lung
p38a controls self-renewal of the lung stem and progenitor
cells by inhibiting proliferation and facilitating differentiation.
Inactivation of p38a leads to a hyperproliferative and immature
lung epithelium that is sensitized to K-RasG12V-induced tumorigenesis (10). However, increased p38 MAPK phosphorylation
has been reported in human lung tumors compared with normal
tissue (3), suggesting that this pathway might contribute to lung
tumor progression.
Liver
p38a controls liver homeostasis by negatively regulating the
proliferation of hepatocytes. Deletion of p38a in mouse hepatocytes facilitates the N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN)–induced
hepatocellular carcinoma through enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS), activation of the JNK/c-Jun pathway, and increased

p38a Roles in Cancer

proliferation (11, 12). In addition, high ROS levels induce hepatocyte death and the release of IL1a, which promotes compensatory proliferation and DEN-induced liver cancer (12). In both
studies, p38a was deleted before the induction of hepatocellular
carcinoma, suggesting a suppressor role in tumor initiation.
Whether p38a could function as a tumor promoter at later stages
of liver tumorigenesis has not been investigated.
Other tissues
p38a balances proliferative and growth-inhibitory signals during normal hematopoiesis (13), and overactivation of p38a
induces hematopoietic stem cell apoptosis, resulting in the development of certain myelodysplastic syndromes (14). In the same
line, the p38a pathway has been proposed to negatively regulate
stemness of glioma-initiating cells, by inducing loss of self-renewal and promoting differentiation (15). Moreover, p38a is
required for the survival of pancreas cancer cell lines and highgrade human pancreas tumors show enhanced levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK, which correlate with reduced expression of
the phosphatase DUSP1 (16).
Taken together, the available data suggest an explanation for
the dual role of p38a in tumorigenesis. During oncogene-induced
tumor initiation and in the early response to carcinogens, p38a
mainly acts as a tumor suppressor by maintaining cell homeostasis and eventually inducing cell death, for example in response
to the accumulation of high ROS levels. However, p38a function
is sometimes altered in the tumor cell so that it favors tumor
progression. This might be due to changes in gene expression
programs that accompany malignant cell transformation or could
be driven by different stimuli available in the microenvironment.
It should be noted that other signaling proteins are known to have
dual functions in tumorigenesis. For example, TGFb family members potently inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in normal
cells, suppressing the early stages of tumorigenesis. However, as
the tumor progresses, genetic and/or biochemical changes allow
TGFb to stimulate tumor progression by acting on both cancer
cells and stromal cells of the tumors (17).

Metastasis
The dissemination of the primary tumor to distant body sites is
a major determinant of cancer patient mortality. Downregulation
of p38a signaling has been associated with the ability of human
colon cancer cells to form lung metastases from established liver
metastases in orthotopic mouse models. This is mediated by
increased expression of parathyroid hormone-like hormone
(PTHLH), a cytokine that induces endothelial cell death in the
lung facilitating extravasation of the tumor cells. Consistent with
these results, low levels of p38 MAPK phosphorylation in human
colorectal tumors inversely associate with higher relapse probability in patients (18). Another study has linked the p38 MAPK
pathway with inhibition of breast cancer metastasis to bone by
acting downstream of Kringle 1 domain of hepatocyte growth
factor (HGFK1) and leading to decreased expression of the
receptor activator of nuclear factor-kB (RANK; ref. 19).
On the other hand, p38a can positively regulate the migration
of several cell types, including tumor cells, as well as the processes
of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor cell intravasation, and colonization of distant sites (20). A recent report has
implicated p38a, downstream of the ubiquitin-conjugating
enzyme Ubc13 and the kinase TAK1, in the metastatic dissemi-

nation of breast cancer cells to the lung in mouse models.
Moreover, p38a and Ubc13 expression correlates with worse
overall survival in human patients with breast cancer (21).
The molecular basis for the pro- or antimetastatic roles of p38a
is not clear. To elucidate the different behaviors observed, it would
be important to address how cells interpret p38 MAPK signals,
considering both the nature and extent of the p38a pathway
activation and the cellular context in which it occurs.

Dormancy
Disseminated cells from the primary tumor that reach a metastatic site can sometimes enter a dormancy state, which is
regulated by signals from the local microenvironment. Studies
in head and neck carcinoma models have shown that the switch
from tumor cell proliferation to dormancy is regulated by the
balance between the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways (22). Growing metastatic lesions
show sustained ERK1/2 activity and reduced p38 MAPK activity,
and genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of p38 MAPK sufﬁces to
interrupt dormancy and restore tumor growth in vivo. Results in
prostate and breast cancer cells support the idea that a low ERK1/2
-p38 MAPK signaling ratio induces dormancy (22).
The microenvironment signals that regulate tumor cell dormancy are starting to be elucidated. For example, high levels of
TGFb2 expressed in bone marrow result in a "restrictive" microenvironment that favors dormancy of head and neck squamous
carcinoma cells, whereas more "permissive" microenvironments
like lung express lower TGFb2 levels, resulting in short-lived
dormancy and metastatic growth. Interestingly, TGFb2 probably
regulates dormancy trough p38 MAPK signaling as high TGFb2 in
bone marrow reduces the ERK1/2-p38 MAPK ratio by activating
p38 MAPK (23).
Tumor dormancy can be considered as a double-edge sword, as
it interferes with the formation of macro-metastasis but may help
tumor cells to resist chemotherapy treatments. Considering dormancy as a survival mechanism implies that tumor cells achieve
sufﬁcient p38 MAPK activity levels to induce growth arrest without triggering apoptosis, so that subsequent regrowth is possible.
It will be important to conﬁrm that tumor dormancy mechanisms
identiﬁed in experimental models operate in cancer patients.

Chemotherapy
Activation of p38a has been proposed to mediate the antitumoral effects of some chemotherapeutic drugs. In colon cancer
cell lines, p38a is necessary for the apoptosis induced by cisplatin
and ﬂuorouracil, which are accounted for by the p38a-mediated
phosphorylation of p53 (24, 25). Apoptosis induced by rituximab
in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells and by STI-571 (imatinib)
in the chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562 (24) are also
mediated by p38a. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of p38a
reverses the growth-inhibitory effects of STI-571 on primary
leukemic granulocyte/macrophage progenitors from patients
with CML (26). These studies have been mostly performed with
cell lines and more in vivo studies are needed to validate the extent
to which p38a mediates chemotherapy effects.
On the other hand, there is strong in vitro and in vivo evidence
supporting that p38a inhibitors potentiate the effect of chemotherapeutic drugs. Thus, the response to cisplatin is enhanced by
p38a inhibition, resulting in ROS-dependent upregulation of the
JNK pathway in colon and breast cancer cells (6). Pharmacologic

inhibition of p38a in mouse models cooperates with cisplatin to
reduce the size and malignancy of breast tumors induced by PyMT
(6) or subcutaneous tumors formed by xenografted human colon
cancer cell lines (27). Similarly, p38a inhibitors sensitize colon
cancer cell lines to the treatment with ﬂuorouracil or iriotecan
(28) and cooperate with arsenic trioxide to induce differentiation
and apoptosis of leukemia cells in vitro and in vivo (29). A recent
study has shown that p38a inhibition, either mediated by shRNAs
or by pharmacologic compounds, sensitizes mouse hepatocellular carcinomas to sorafenib therapy (30). Therefore, the combination of sorafenib and p38 MAPK inhibition looks promising to
overcome therapy resistance in human hepatocellular carcinoma.
In some cases, high levels of p38 MAPK activity in chemoresistant
cancer cells have been correlated with the upregulation of Pglycoprotein, a plasma membrane transporter involved in the efﬂux
of chemotherapeutic drugs like cisplatin or doxorubicin (27).
The survival of cancer cells upon nutrient withdrawal has been
proposed to rely on the reorganization of the glucose metabolism
by p38a (31). Thus, starvation induces higher glucose uptake
through HIF1a stabilization and proteasome-dependent degradation of PFKFB3, leading to autophagy activation, which is
reversed by the downregulation or inhibition of p38a. The
modulation of autophagy could underlie the protective effect of
p38a on starvation-induced cell death. In general, p38a appears
to orchestrate adaptive responses to unfavorable stress conditions, which could contribute to the emergence of tumor-resistant
phenotypes, making this pathway a potential therapeutic target
for the enhancement of conventional therapies. An additional
mechanism by which p38a could facilitate chemotherapy resistance is by inducing tumor cell dormancy, as nondividing cells
are thought to be more resistant to cytotoxic treatments.
In summary, increasing evidence supports an important role of
p38a facilitating tumor chemoresistance. The in vivo studies are
critical, given that extracellular factors present in the tumor
microenvironment could inﬂuence the response of tumor cells
to particular treatments. Reports using cancer cell lines in vitro,
although useful, do not reﬂect the complex interactions between
different cell types in the tumor microenvironment, which may
sometimes result in misleading information.

Therapeutic Opportunities
The ability of p38a to suppress the initial phases of malignant
cell transformation is supported by genetic evidence in mouse
models of lung and liver cancer (10, 11). Intriguingly, the proapoptotic function of p38a is sometimes impaired in tumor cells
and there is evidence supporting that p38a can facilitate colorectal
tumor maintenance in mouse models (7). Thus, p38a inhibitors
may sufﬁce to impair the growth of tumors where this pathway is
required for cancer cell proliferation or survival, but these inhibitors could potentially stimulate tumorigenesis in other tissues.
There is also evidence for dual roles of p38a in metastasis, as
downregulation of p38a signaling facilitates the metastatic spread
of colon cancer cells from liver to lung (18), whereas a p38a
pharmacologic inhibitor attenuates breast cancer metastasis (21).
The development of new therapeutic strategies clearly requires a
better understanding of the speciﬁc targets involved in the different functions of p38a and how they contribute to speciﬁc tumoral
processes
In addition, recent data strongly implicate p38a signaling in the
resistance to chemotherapeutic treatments. A number of drugs

4000 Cancer Res; 75(19) October 1, 2015

used for cancer chemotherapy induce damage DNA, resulting in
cell death, and p38a activation has been shown to mediate cell
survival in response to DNA damage. In these cases, p38a inhibition sensitizes tumor cells to the chemotherapeutic response
and enhances cell death, implying that this pathway may facilitate
drug resistance. This prosurvival effect of p38a can be probably
explained by several mechanisms, including the contribution of
this pathway to the repair of the damaged DNA prior to the cell
entering mitosis. Intriguingly, experiments with cell lines suggest
that p38a activation might occasionally have the opposite result
mediating drug-induced cell death, so the inhibitors would interfere with antitumoral effects. It should be noted that the speciﬁc
signaling pathways activated by DNA damage might vary depending on the cell type, the DNA damage stimuli, and the extent of
DNA damage. Moreover, some p38a targets are tissue speciﬁc,
such as the phosphorylation of GSK3b at Ser399 that is thought to
occur predominantly in brain (32). This could explain why
sometimes p38a inhibition results in chemotherapy sensitization
while in other cases it is linked to resistance.
The combination of p38a inhibitors with chemotherapeutic
drugs looks like a promising strategy for the treatment of some
tumors, as in the case of cisplatin and irinotecan for breast and
colon cancer (6, 28) and sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma
(30). However, it is difﬁcult to forecast at the moment what type of
tumors would beneﬁt from the combined therapies. Predictive
biomarkers would be very useful to select the patients who are
most likely to beneﬁt from the p38a inhibitors. These could be
based on the elucidation of the p38a pathway activation status in
different tumor types, for example by immunohistochemistry
analysis with phospho-speciﬁc antibodies against p38a or selected downstream targets such as ATF2 (30), or by using p38a
pathway-speciﬁc gene expression signatures. Results obtained
from genetically modiﬁed mice have also provided interesting
insights into how patients could be selected for therapies based on
p38a inhibitors. For example, disruption of the p38a and p38b
genes results in mouse embryo malformations (33), suggesting
that these inhibitors should not be used to treat pregnant woman.
Likewise, genetic downregulation of p38a sensitized to K-RasG12V
induced lung tumorigenesis (10), suggesting that inhibitors of
this pathway should not be considered in populations at risk of
lung cancer such as heavy smokers. Interestingly, the p38 MAPK
inhibitor losmapimod has given promising results in a clinical
trial for myocardial infraction (34), suggesting that p38 MAPK
inhibitors could be potentially useful in patients with both cardiac
diseases and cancer.
A large number of p38a inhibitors, which generally also
inhibit p38b, have been developed. Currently, there are about
50 ongoing clinical studies using p38 MAPK inhibitors from
different pharmaceutical companies for a wide variety of diseases (https://clinicaltrials.gov/). Potential lack of efﬁcacy
could be due to the p38a pathway playing a less important
role in a particular function than originally anticipated. Alternatively, cells could bypass the p38a inhibition by engaging
other p38 MAPK family members, which could have overlapping functions with p38a. It remains to be established the
extent to which different p38 MAPK family members might
interplay during tumor development. Pleiotropic interactions
with other signaling pathways may also allow cells to bypass
p38a inhibition, as it is not unusual that several pathways are
simultaneously activated and contribute to a particular cellular
process. Given the redundancy in signaling pathways and the

p38a Roles in Cancer

adaptive capacity of cancer cells, drug combinations are increasingly being investigated for therapy.
An alternative therapeutic approach could be to target other
components in the p38a pathway. Identiﬁcation and characterization of the substrates involved in the different p38aregulated processes could provide a larger repertoire of potential targets to reduce the deleterious effects while maintaining
protective functions. This strategy might alleviate the possibility of toxicities due to p38a homeostatic functions and could
also improve selectivity. For example, the MAPK-activated
protein kinase-2 (MK2) regulates posttranscriptional expression of cytokines and other processes downstream of p38a
signaling. MK2-null mice are healthy and do not have any overt
phenotype, suggesting that targeting MK2 could be less toxic
than p38a inhibition. Interestingly, downregulation of MK2
has been reported to sensitize p53-deﬁcient lung tumor cells to
apoptosis induced by cisplatin and doxorubicin in mouse
models (35).
The inhibition of protumorigenic roles of p38a while maintaining its growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing effects
would be also an interesting therapeutic approach. Development
of these ideas requires a much better deﬁnition of the molecular
mechanisms that underlie these events. Generation of reagents
that speciﬁcally activate or inhibit the p38a pathway in particular
cells types could be also very useful.

tiple cellular processes. The available data indicate that the p38a
pathway can regulate tumorigenesis at different levels and
through distinct mechanisms depending on the cell type and the
tumoral stage (Fig. 1). Of particular interest, is the evidence
indicating that p38a often facilitates tumor cell survival in
response to chemotherapeutic treatments. It would be very interesting to elucidate biomarkers for tumor-promoting activities of
p38a, so that tumor types and chemotherapeutic drugs that could
beneﬁt from p38a inhibition are identiﬁed. Of note, therapy
outcomes would be affected by the functions of p38a signaling in
different cell types of the tumor microenvironment, which are
likely to impinge on tumor development. Further studies are
clearly needed to realize the full potential of p38a inhibitors in
cancer therapy, but we believe that recent results are encouraging.
The devil is in the detail.
