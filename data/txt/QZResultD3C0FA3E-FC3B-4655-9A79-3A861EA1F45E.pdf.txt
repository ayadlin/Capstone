Abstract
Intrinsic tumor resistance to radiotherapy limits the efﬁcacy
of ionizing radiation (IR). Sensitizing cancer cells speciﬁcally to
IR would improve tumor control and decrease normal tissue
toxicity. The development of tumor-targeting technologies
allows for developing potent radiosensitizing drugs. We
hypothesized that the anti-tubulin agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE), a component of a clinically approved antibodydirected conjugate, could function as a potent radiosensitizer
and be selectively delivered to tumors using an activatable cellpenetrating peptide targeting matrix metalloproteinases and
RGD-binding integrins (ACPP–cRGD–MMAE). We evaluated
the ability of MMAE to radiosensitize both established cancer
cells and a low-passage cultured human pancreatic tumor cell
line using clonogenic and DNA damage assays. MMAE sensitized colorectal and pancreatic cancer cells to IR in a schedule-

and dose-dependent manner, correlating with mitotic arrest.
Radiosensitization was evidenced by decreased clonogenic survival and increased DNA double-strand breaks in irradiated
cells treated with MMAE. MMAE in combination with IR
resulted in increased DNA damage signaling and activation of
CHK1. To test a therapeutic strategy of MMAE and IR, PANC-1
or HCT-116 murine tumor xenografts were treated with nontargeted free MMAE or tumor-targeted MMAE (ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE). While free MMAE in combination with IR resulted in
tumor growth delay, tumor-targeted ACPP-cRGD-MMAE with
IR produced a more robust and signiﬁcantly prolonged tumor
regression in xenograft models. Our studies identify MMAE as a
potent radiosensitizer. Importantly, MMAE radiosensitization
can be localized to tumors by targeted activatable cell-penetrating peptides. Cancer Res; 75(7); 1376–87. 2015 AACR.

Introduction

chemotherapy drugs to radiosensitize. Radiosensitizers increase
ionizing radiation (IR)-mediated DNA damage and tumor cell
kill (5–7). To be clinically useful, radiation sensitizers must
improve the therapeutic index, that is, the level of sensitization
of tumor cells must be greater than that of normal tissue. A major
limitation to using more potent radiosensitizers is the inability
to deliver such agents speciﬁcally to the tumor.
Cell sensitivity to IR varies throughout the cell cycle with G2–M
being the most sensitive phase (8). Chemotherapy drugs such as
paclitaxel block cells in G2–M, function as radiosensitizers, and
are used clinically with radiotherapy (9). Monomethyl auristatin
E (MMAE) is a synthetic derivative of dolastatin 10 and functions
as a potent antimitotic agent by inhibiting tubulin polymerization (10). We therefore tested the ability of MMAE to function as a
radiosensitizer. However like many potent antitumor agents,
systemic delivery of MMAE is limited by toxicity. When MMAE
delivery is tumor restricted by conjugation to a CD30 targeting
antibody (brentuximab vedotin), its efﬁcacy becomes clinically
apparent for lymphomas (11, 12).
To evaluate the ability of targeted MMAE tumor delivery to
radiosensitize tumors, we used activatable cell-penetrating peptide (ACPP) technology. ACPP can function as tumor-targeted
delivery vehicles (13–16). MMAE has recently been conjugated to
ACPP-cRGD as a therapeutic payload (ACPP–cRGD–MMAE) in
murine models of breast cancer (17). ACPPs consist of 4 regions: a
polyanionic autoinhibitory domain, a protease-sensitive peptide
linker region, a cell-penetrating polycationic peptide, and the

Locally advanced tumors are commonly treated with combination chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In randomized clinical
trials, concurrent chemotherapy–radiotherapy has demonstrated
improved local tumor control and overall survival, including
gastrointestinal tumors (1–4). A principal rationale for using
concurrent chemotherapy with radiotherapy is the ability of

MMAE-Mediated Radiosensitization

payload to be delivered. The polycationic cell-penetrating peptide
consists of 9 D-arginines (r9) and the autoinhibitory portion is 9 Dglutamates (e9). A ﬂexible peptide linker separates these 2
domains. For therapeutic applications, anticancer drugs are the
payload conjugated to the polycationic cell-penetrating peptide
portion to facilitate their intracellular delivery (17). While the
ACPP is intact, the polyanion region prevents adhesion and
uptake of the polycationic cell-penetrating peptide plus payload.
Upon extracellular protease attack on the linker region, drugconjugated r9 is released and taken up by cells, where a second
protease in the endocytic pathway releases the drug from the r9.
Tumor-speciﬁc activation of ACPP has been achieved by inserting
a PLGC(Me)AG linker sequence between the polyanionic and
polycationic regions. Cleavage of this peptide linker is dependent
on gelatinases, MMP-2 and -9. To augment MMP activity and
cleavage of PLGC(Me)AG, the ACPP was designed to co-target
RGD-binding integrins. avb3 integrin binds to the hemopexin
domain of MMP-2 and enhances MMP activation (18).
Here, we evaluated the ability of MMAE to radiosensitize
tumor cells and to be targeted to tumor xenografts in combination with IR. We show MMAE arrests cells in G2–M in the 1 to
5 nmol/L range and has an IC50 that is >6-fold lower than
paclitaxel. Of signiﬁcance, we demonstrate that in addition to
its intrinsic antitumor activity, MMAE sensitized cells to IR.
MMAE radiosensitization showed both schedule and dose
dependency, with MMAE radiosensitization directly correlating
with accumulation of cells in G2–M. In irradiated cells treated
with MMAE, there was decreased clonogenic survival and
increased activation of the DNA damage response. We then
evaluated a therapeutic strategy of combining MMAE with IR in
murine tumor xenograft models. We tested both nontargeted
and tumor targeted MMAE delivery in PANC-1 and HCT-116
xenografts. For tumor-targeted delivery, we used ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE. Combining ACPP–cRGD–MMAE with IR in either
HCT-116 or PANC-1 tumor xenografts resulted in prolonged
tumor xenograft regression that was not observed with IR or
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE alone. Moreover, the advantage of tumortargeted MMAE delivery was demonstrated in irradiated tumor
xenografts. ACPP–cRGD–MMAE tumor-targeted delivery increased tumor xenograft control compared with free MMAE.
Our results lay the foundation to test a therapeutic treatment
paradigm in which selective and potent radiosensitization can
be achieved with tumor-targeted ACPP.

Materials and Methods
Cells and reagents
Human colorectal HCT-116 (ATCC CCL-247) and pancreatic
PANC-1 (ATCC CRL-1469) adenocarcinoma cell lines were directly obtained from ATCC (STR tested) and passaged for less than 6
months following resuscitation. 779E is a limited passage pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line developed in the Lowy laboratory from patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenograft.
779E has been whole-exome sequenced in 2014 for mutational
status and also was conﬁrmed to be human origin. The XPA-1 cell
line was initially derived from a patient-derived pancreatic xenograft from Johns Hopkins (Baltimore, MD) and provided by the
Lowy laboratory. Cells were negative for mycoplasma before use
in experiments. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with
10% FBS. For patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts (PDX), primary tumors from patients were directly

implanted orthotopically into NOD/SCID gamma (NSG) mice
and passaged serially by orthotopic re-implantation. Paclitaxel
(Sigma) and MMAE (Concortis) were both reconstituted in
DMSO. ACPP and ratiometric ACPP peptides were synthesized
as previously reported (17, 19).
Cell cycle and apoptosis
Cells were treated with MMAE for 24 hours and then ﬁxed in
methanol. Cells were treated with RNAse, stained with propidium
iodide (PI), and analyzed by FACS using FlowJo software.
Alamar blue assay
Cells were plated in 96-well plates and exposed to MMAE or
paclitaxel for 72 hours and analyzed at 560 nm. For irradiated
cells, cells were treated with MMAE overnight followed by 6 Gy.
Clonogenic assay
Cells were treated with MMAE for 24 hours and then irradiated
with 0 to 8 Gy. Following IR, cells were replated in drug-free
media. Colonies formed over 10 to 14 days and were counted.
Neutral comet assay
Cells were treated for indicated length and doses of MMAE
followed by 6 Gy. Cells were harvested 15 minutes after IR and
underwent neutral electrophoresis (Trevigen). Comet tails were
counted in multiple ﬁelds (>60 cells per sample) and analyzed
using CometScore (TriTek Corp).
gH2Ax immunostaining
Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with MMAE
overnight and then irradiated. Two hours after IR, cells were ﬁxed,
permeabilized, and stained with antibody to gH2Ax. Nuclei were
stained with 40 ,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Foci were
counted in 6 to 8 high-power ﬁelds per group.
Immunoblotting
MMAE- and IR-treated cells were harvested and lysed in RIPA
buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Roche). Thirty
micrograms of lysate underwent electrophoresis using 4% to 12%
Bis–Tris gels (Life Technologies), transferred to polyvinylidene
diﬂuoride (PVDF) membranes, and incubated with indicated
primary antibodies (Cell Signaling Technology). Blots were developed by ECL (Pierce).
Tumor xenograft gel zymography
All animal work was done in compliance with the UCSD
Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Six- to 8-weekold female athymic nu/nu mice (UCSD Animal Care Program)
were injected subcutaneously into thighs with 5  106 HCT-116
or PANC-1 cells in a 1:1 Matrigel (BD) and PBS solution. After
tumors grew to >200 mm3, the right tumor hindlimb was focally
irradiated whereas the remainder of the mouse including the left
tumor hindlimb was shielded from IR with custom lead blocking
>95% of the dose as veriﬁed by dosimeters placed on the mouse.
Tumors were excised from animals 1 day after IR. Nonirradiated
pancreatic adenocarcinoma PDX tumors were also tested for
gelatinase activity. Tris–SDS buffer was added at a ratio of 9 mL
buffer per mg of tissue. Tumors were homogenized, centrifuged,
and the supernatant diluted 1:1 with PBS. Tris-glycine sample
buffer (2) was added and the samples were run on zymography

gels (Life Technologies). The gels were placed in renaturing buffer
and then transferred to developing buffer (Life Technologies).
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were treated with IR or intravenous injection of ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE, tumor tissue was harvested, formalin ﬁxed, and
parafﬁn embedded followed by staining with indicated antibodies (Ventana Medical Systems). The primary antibody was
used at a 1:250 dilution and was visualized using DAB as a
chromagen with the UltraMap system (Ventana Medical Systems).
In vivo tumor xenograft optical imaging
Tumor xenografts were irradiated as described above. One day
after IR, mice were anesthetized (1:1 mixture of 100 mg/mL of
ketamine and 5 mg/mL of midazolam) and intravenously
injected with either ﬂuorescently labeled ratiometric ACPP (Cy5
and Cy7) or ACPP–cRGD–MMAE (Cy5). Animals were imaged
using a Maestro Small Animal Imager (CRI) with excitation ﬁlter
of 620/22 nm and 645 nm long-pass emission ﬁlter with
dichroic ﬁlter tuned to 670 nm. Imaging was done both with
skin on and after skin removal to decrease autoﬂuorescence and
scattering.
In vivo tumor xenograft experiments
HCT-116 or PANC-1 tumor growth was measured with digital
calipers. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula as
1
/2  length  width2. Mice were randomized into groups as
indicated in Results once the average tumor volume reached
>200 mm3. Free MMAE was injected on an equimolar basis to
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE.
Statistical analysis
Unpaired 2-sided t tests were performed for IC50 and radiosensitization experiments in cell culture. In tumor regression
studies, 2-way ANOVA analysis was performed with Tukey multiple comparison group. All statistical analyses were performed
using Prism software (GraphPad).

Results
Cytotoxicity of MMAE against tumor cell lines
We ﬁrst tested the ability of MMAE to block proliferating
tumor cells in G2–M. Established tumor cell lines (HCT-116
and PANC-1) were exposed to MMAE for 24 hours and then
collected. HCT-116 and PANC-1 cells showed a dose–response
accumulation of cells in the G2–M, with PANC-1 cells more
sensitive to MMAE than HCT-116 cells (Fig. 1A). MMAE at
5 nmol/L resulted in 50% of HCT-116 cells blocked in
G2–M and at 2 nmol/L in PANC-1 cells.
We next compared the cytotoxicity of MMAE to paclitaxel.
Tumor cells were exposed to MMAE or paclitaxel for 72 hours
and cell viability was assessed. For HCT-116, the IC50 values for
paclitaxel and MMAE were 10.0 and 1.7 nmol/L (Fig. 1B and
D). For PANC-1, the IC50 values for paclitaxel and MMAE were
15.1 and 0.6 nmol/L (Fig. 1C and D). We also tested a limited
passage human pancreatic tumor cell line, 779E. 779E was
more resistant to both antimitotic agents; however, it also
showed increased sensitivity to MMAE. The IC50 values following paclitaxel or MMAE exposure were 52.0 and 5.6 nmol/L,
respectively (Fig. 1D).

Interaction of MMAE and IR to increase DNA double-strand
breaks
Because MMAE blocks cells in the radiosensitive G2–M phase
of the cell cycle, we tested whether MMAE speciﬁcally interacted
with IR. We hypothesized that while a short exposure to MMAE
would not inﬂuence radiosensitivity, prolonged MMAE exposure with cells accumulating in G2–M would increase sensitivity
to IR. DNA double-stand breaks are a hallmark of IR damage
and can be measured by neutral comet assay. HCT-116 cells
were treated with 5 nmol/L MMAE for varying lengths of time
(0, 2, 4, or 24 hours) and then irradiated (Fig. 2A). Irradiation
of cell exposed to MMAE for 2 or 4 hours did not increase
comet tail length compared with IR alone. However, 24-hour
exposure to MMAE signiﬁcantly increased comet tail length
in irradiated cells compared with vehicle or shorter MMAE
exposure time. Immunoblotting for cell phase–speciﬁc cyclins
demonstrated that 24-hour MMAE exposure resulted in the
speciﬁc accumulation of the G2–M cyclin B compared with
nonmitotic cyclins. A similar schedule dependence of MMAE
on IR-induced DNA damage was observed in PANC-1 cells
(Supplementary Fig. S1A).
Next, we evaluated whether 24-hour exposure to MMAE
increased IR-induced DNA breaks in a dose-dependent manner.
In irradiated HCT-116 cells, treating with 1 nmol/L MMAE did not
increase DNA damage over IR alone. However, 5 nmol/L MMAE
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in IR-induced DNA doublestranded breaks. These results are concordant with dose–response
effects of MMAE on cell cycle in HCT-116 cells, where 1 nmol/L
of MMAE did not alter the cell-cycle proﬁle but 5 nmol/L did
(Fig. 1A). Overnight MMAE exposure also signiﬁcantly increased
comet tail length following IR in XPA-1 and 779E cells (Supplementary Fig. S1B and S1C).
MMAE decreases clonogenic survival in irradiated cells
Because MMAE increased IR-induced DNA double-strand
breaks, we determined whether MMAE decreased survival in
irradiated cells. In the ﬁrst series of experiments, HCT-116 and
PANC-1 tumor cell lines were incubated with varying doses of
MMAE overnight and then irradiated with 6 Gy the following day.
Cells were continuously exposed to MMAE, and tumor cell
viability was measured 72 hours after initiation of MMAE treatment. In HCT116 cells, the IC50 for MMAE decreased from 1.6
nmol/L for MMAE alone treated cells to 0.8 nmol/L in cells treated
with MMAE and IR (Fig. 3A). In PANC-1 cells, a similar relative
reduction (50%) in the IC50 of MMAE was observed. In nonirradiated PANC-1 cells, the IC50 value for MMAE was 0.8 nmol/L,
which decreased to 0.4 nmol/L when IR was combined with
MMAE (Fig. 3B).
The primary mode of cell death following IR is mitotic catastrophe. Therefore, we tested the ability of MMAE to decrease
clonogenic cell survival. HCT-116 or PANC-1 cells were exposed
to MMAE overnight and then irradiated with 0 to 8 Gy. On the
basis of the cell-cycle dose response to MMAE from Fig. 1A, we
treated HCT-116 cells with 5 nmol/L and PANC-1 cells with
2 nmol/L of MMAE. Following irradiation, cells were replated
in drug-free media at low cell density and colonies grew out over
10 to 14 days. Cell-surviving fractions were normalized to 1 for
nonirradiated cells treated with either vehicle or MMAE. MMAE
resulted in increased tumor cell kill at doses as low as 2 Gy (Fig. 3C
and D). Because conventionally fractionated radiotherapy for
tumors is often given with 2 Gy concurrently with chemotherapy,

we measured the surviving fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) with varying
doses of MMAE. For HCT116, the SF2 for cells treated with
1 nmol/L MMAE was not signiﬁcantly different from vehicletreated cells. However, at doses of 2 and 5 nmol/L MMAE, there
was a signiﬁcant reduction in the SF2 compared with cells irradiated with vehicle (Fig. 3E). Consistent with our above results
with MMAE alone, irradiated PANC-1 cells showed increased
sensitivity at lower MMAE doses. The SF2 in PANC-1 cells was
signiﬁcantly reduced with 1 or 2 nmol/L of MMAE compared with
vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 3F).
MMAE increases DNA damage response in irradiated cells
Because MMAE reduced clonogenic cell survival following IR,
we tested whether MMAE increased apoptosis in irradiated cells.
HCT-116 cells were treated with MMAE for 24 hours followed by
IR. Cells were collected 24 hours after IR and the sub-G1 population (apoptotic) was measured. MMAE alone resulted in a
signiﬁcant increase in apoptosis compared with vehicle-treated
cells (Fig. 4A). However, there was no further increase in apoptosis

when IR was combined with MMAE. Because MMAE increased
DNA double-strand breaks in irradiated cells (Fig. 2), we then
evaluated whether MMAE altered the DNA damage response in
irradiated cells. HCT-116 cells were treated with MMAE for 24
hours followed by 6 Gy. Cells were collected 1 hour after IR, and
activation of the DNA damage checkpoint proteins CHK1
(pS345) and CHK2 (pT68) was ascertained (Fig. 4B). Interestingly, MMAE enhanced CHK1 activation in irradiated cells,
whereas CHK2 activation was not affected. Upon DNA damage,
histone H2A becomes phosphorylated at S139, gH2AX. MMAE
signiﬁcantly increased gH2AX foci formation in irradiated HCT116 and PANC-1 cells (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S2).
In nonirradiated cells, MMAE did not alter DNA damage.

tumors, we used MMAE conjugated to a dual integrin and MMPtargeted ACPP, ACPP–cRGD–MMAE (17). The linker region of
this ACPP is a substrate for MMP-2 and MMP-9. We ﬁrst tested
whether orthotopically grown patient-derived pancreatic adenocarcinoma xenografts (PDX) expressed MMP activity. Two unique
PDX xenografts both contained gelatinase activity (Fig. 5A).
Next, we tested whether HCT-116 and PANC-1 tumor xenografts
had gelatinase activity. Nonirradiated HCT-116 and PANC-1
tumor lysates both contained gelatinase activity as measured by
gel zymography (Fig. 5B). We also tested whether tumor irradiation altered MMP activity. Tumor xenografts were irradiated
with a single dose of 6 Gy and harvested the following day.
Irradiation of tumors did not hamper gelatinase activity. Because
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE is co-targeted to cRGD-binding integrin
avb3, we analyzed b3 integrin expression and found that
PANC-1 and HCT-116 tumors expressed b3 integrin (Fig. 5C and
Supplementary Fig. S3). One day after IR, irradiated tumors also
abundantly expressed b3 integrin.
To directly assess whether HCT-116 and PANC-1 tumor xenografts can cleave the PLGC(Me)AG linker region incorporated

1380 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

into ACPP–cRGD–MMAE, we used a ratiometric ACPP probe
with the same MMP substrate sequence (19). Ratiometric ACPP
has a Cy5 far red ﬂuorescent donor and Cy7 near-infrared ﬂuorescent acceptor. While intact, the peptide will favor Cy7 reemission when excited with Cy5 excitation wavelengths, resulting
in a low Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio (blue pseudocolor). However,
when the peptide is cleaved, Cy5 emission is no longer quenched,
resulting in a higher Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio (red pseudocolor).
Tumors were grown in the bilateral hindlimbs. The right
hindlimb tumor–bearing region was irradiated, whereas the left
hindlimb tumor was shielded. The following day ratiometric
ACPP (10 nmoles) was injected intravenously and mice were
imaged 2 hours later. Tumors were imaged in situ and after
excision. In both HCT-116 and PANC-1 tumors, tumors had
increase in Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio compared with surrounding
normal tissue, which is indicative of tumor protease activity
cleaving the linker region within the ACPP molecule and releasing
the polycationic cell penetrating peptide (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Irradiation of tumors 1 day before ratiometric
ACPP injection did not diminish peptide cleavage compared

increased Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio in irradiated tumors compared
with nonirradiated tumors (Supplementary Fig. S4B).
Therapeutic efﬁcacy of combining an integrin and MMPtargeted ACPP–cRGD–MMAE with IR
We next tested a therapeutic paradigm of using of ACPPcRGD to deliver the potent radiosensitizer, MMAE. We ﬁrst
validated that MMAE conjugated to the polycationic cell penetrating peptide (r9) was cytotoxic to tumor cells. HCT-116,
PANC-1, and 779E cells were exposed to r9 alone or r9 conjugated to MMAE (r9-MMAE). Carrier r9 alone had no cytotoxicity,
whereas r9-MMAE produced cytotoxicity in all 3 tumor cell lines
(Supplementary Fig. S5). We then tested whether ACPP-cRGDMMAE accumulated in HCT-116 and PANC-1 tumor xenografts.

region was intravenously injected. Tumors were imaged 6 hours
later. As with ratiometric ACPP (Fig. 5D), ACPP–cRGD–MMAE
accumulated in both the nonirradiated and irradiated tumor
xenografts (Fig. 6A). To determine whether ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE delivered functionally active MMAE within the tumor,
HCT-116 tumor xenografts were harvested 24 hours following ACPP–cRGD–MMAE intravenous injection and stained
for the mitotic marker, pS10 histone H3 (Fig. 6B). In mice
intravenously injected with ACPP–cRGD–MMAE, tumor xenografts demonstrated a 32% increase in pS10 histone H3 staining
compared with vehicle treatment, P ¼ 0.002.
We then evaluated the efﬁcacy of combined MMAE with focal
IR to inhibit tumor xenograft growth. First, we tested the hypothesis that MMAE tumor–targeted delivery would increase tumor
regression compared with free MMAE delivery (Fig. 6C). PANC-1
tumor xenografts were grown to a mean volume of 200 mm3

before initiation of therapy. Free MMAE or ACPP–cRGD–MMAE
was intravenously injected on days 0 and 1 (6 nmoles of MMAE/
d). This dose of MMAE was chosen based on prior studies on
animal toxicity associated with free MMAE delivery. Fractionated
IR of 3 Gy per day was given on days 1 and 2. On day 1, when
MMAE and IR were both given, IR was delivered in the morning
and MMAE in the afternoon. By day 30 following initiation of
therapy, free MMAE treatment resulted in a small but statistically
signiﬁcant growth delay of PANC-1 tumors compared with
untreated control tumors, P < 0.0001. The average tumor volume
of free MMAE-treated mice was 75% of untreated controls. More
importantly, free MMAE in combination with IR resulted in
profound tumor xenograft regression compared with IR or free
MMAE alone (P < 0.0001). In comparing targeted and free MMAE
delivery in the absence of IR, ACPP–cRGD–MMAE resulted in
signiﬁcantly greater tumor regression compared with free MMAE,
which is consistent with prior studies involving breast cancer
models (17). Of signiﬁcance, IR combined with ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE resulted in prolonged tumor regression when compared
with free MMAE and IR (P < 0.01). Longer follow-up of tumors
demonstrated that 2 of 10 PANC-1 tumors treated with ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE and IR were less than or equal to their starting
tumor volume on day 0 (Table 1). Of signiﬁcance, such prolonged
and sustained tumor regression was observed with only 2 doses of

1382 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

both MMAE and IR and the initial tumor volume was greater than
200 mm3. Moreover, no other treatment group showed long-term
tumor regression.
We extended our studies on ACPP–cRGD–MMAE and IR by
increasing the dosing schedule to see whether it would result in
further improvement in long-term regression. ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE was given on days 0, 1, and 2 (6 nmoles/day, 18 nmoles
total). Fractionated IR of 3 Gy per day was administered on days 1
to 3. Again on days when ACPP–cRGD–MMAE and IR were both
given, IR was delivered in the morning and ACPP–cRGD–MMAE
in the afternoon. As we observed in Fig. 6C, combining ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE with IR again produced signiﬁcant tumor regression compared with IR or ACPP–cRGD–MMAE alone treated mice
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Tumor volumes in the combined ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE and IR mice remained statistically signiﬁcant compared with all other groups, P<0.0001. More striking and of
therapeutic importance, the majority of treated tumors had prolonged tumor regression in PANC-1 tumors upon combining
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE with IR. By day 40, none of the control or IR
alone treated tumors were smaller than their initial tumor volume
on day 0 (Table 1). For the ACPP–cRGD–MMAE alone group,
only 1 of 14 tumors was smaller than their initial tumor volumes.
In contrast, 8 of 14 tumors in the combined ACPP–cRGD–MMAE
and IR group were smaller than their initial tumor volume.

delivered 6 Gy on day 0 followed by 3 Gy on days 1 and 2. ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE was intravenously injected on days 0 and 1, 6 hours
following irradiation (7.5 nmoles/day). The dose of ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE was increased compared with PANC-1, as HCT116 cells had a higher IC50 for MMAE. As seen in PANC-1 tumors,
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE alone produced a modest growth delay
compared with untreated control tumors (Fig. 6D). As expected,
IR alone resulted in an initial tumor growth delay (especially
prominent due to the 6 Gy dose on day 0); however by day 10,
tumor volume began to increase. Combining ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE with IR again produced sustained tumor regression compared with IR alone starting at day 10 after the initiation of
therapy, P < 0.006. By day 14, none of the control or ACPP–
RGD–MMAE–treated tumors were smaller than their initial
tumor volume on day 0 (Table 1). For the IR alone group, only
3 of 10 tumors were smaller than their initial tumor volume. In
contrast, 9 of 10 tumors in the combined ACPP–cRGD–MMAE
and IR group were smaller than their initial tumor volume.

Discussion
In these series of studies, we have identiﬁed that MMAE can
radiosensitize tumor cells and enhance tumor xenograft regression in combination with IR. Moreover, we tested a therapeutic
paradigm whereby a potent radiosensitizer such as MMAE can be
selectively delivered to tumors using ACPP to increase tumor
response to IR (Supplementary Fig. S7). MMAE, a synthetic
derivative of dolastatin 10, sensitizes cancer cells to IR-mediated
DNA damage and cell kill (10). Intrinsic tumor cell resistance to IR
is dependent on a multitude of factors, including activity of DNA
repair pathways, tumor oxygenation status, and the cell cycle (5–
7). By pharmacologically targeting these pathways, cells become
more sensitive to the effects of IR. An optimal cancer therapeutic
agent would have the dual beneﬁt of single-agent potent tumoricidal activity and also sensitize tumors to IR. Our data support
MMAE as a candidate that meets such requirements.
MMAE has previously been shown to have single-agent antitumor efﬁcacy against a broad panel of tumor histologies when
appropriately delivered (17, 20, 21). In our own studies with
established cancer cells and a limited patient passage patientderived pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell line, MMAE had an IC50
that is at least 6-fold lower than paclitaxel (Fig. 1). MMAE is an
anti-tubulin agent that blocks cells in G2–M, and the G2–M phase
of the cell cycle is the most sensitive to the IR (8). We demonstrated that MMAE increased IR induced DNA double-strand
breaks in both a schedule- and a dose-dependent manner that
directly correlated with the accumulation of cells in G2–M (Figs. 1

1384 Cancer Res; 75(7) April 1, 2015

and 2). MMAE also decreased clonogenic survival of pancreatic
and colorectal cancer cells in the 1 to 5 nmol/L range in combination with IR indicative of its application as a potent radiosensitizer. Mechanistically, MMAE increased clonogenic cell death
in irradiated cells. The decreased cell survival following combined
IR and MMAE was not due to apoptosis, suggesting mitotic
catastrophe as the cause of MMAE enhanced cell death in irradiated cells. In support of this, MMAE enhanced the DNA damage
response pathway in irradiated cells. Both gH2AX foci formation
and activation of CHK1 were increased in cells treated with MMAE
before irradiation. Understanding the cellular response to MMAE
can allow for future rational drug combinations with MMAE to
further augment radiosensitization by inhibiting survival pathways induced by MMAE.
While MMAE is a potent radiosensitizer in vitro, it requires
tumor-targeted delivery to achieve a clinically meaningful therapeutic index in vivo. We have therefore initially evaluated a
strategy using MMP and cRGD-binding integrin targeted ACPP
delivery of MMAE in combination with focal IR (17). A major
limitation to the therapeutic use of radiosensitizers is the lack of
tumor-speciﬁc delivery (22, 23). Radiosensitizer delivery that is
nontargeted can result in increased radiosensitization of not
only tumor cells but also surrounding normal tissue. This results
in no net gain in the therapeutic index of radiotherapy. Previous
reports have tested nanoparticles as radiosensitizer delivery
vehicles (24–27). Here, we have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of
ACPP technology to deliver the potent radiosensitizer MMAE
speciﬁcally to tumors. Following MMP-2/-9 and avb3 integrin
targeted delivery and release of MMAE conjugated cell-penetrating peptide from the ACPP, tumor xenografts demonstrated
prolonged regression in combination with IR compared with
nontargeted free MMAE delivery (Fig. 6 and Table 1). Moreover
at equimolar systemic intravenous injection, ACPP–cRGD–
MMAE improved tumor xenograft regression when compared
with nontargeted MMAE for both nonirradiated and irradiated
tumors. We also tested altering the order of delivery of IR and
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE. In the PANC-1 xenograft experiments,
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE was initially injected 1 day before 3 Gy
fractions of IR (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Fig. S6). These experiments were designed on the basis of MMAE functioning as a
radiosensitizer by blocking tumor cells in G2–M. Therefore,
MMAE was injected into mice before irradiation. To test the
ability of IR to modulate the tumor environment and increase
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE tumor accumulation, we altered the treatment scheduling, with a larger 6 Gy dose given 1 day before
ACPP–cRGD–MMAE injection in HCT-116 xenografts (Fig. 6D).
The rationale for an initial 6 Gy in the HCT-116 tumor xenograft
experiment was 2-fold. First, HCT-116 tumors grow more rapidly in our tumor model compared with PANC-1 tumor xenografts. Second, a dose of 6 Gy increased ratiometric ACPP
activation in irradiated tumors compared with nonirradiated
tumors (Fig. 5D and Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, we
hypothesized that pre-irradiation would increase ACPP-mediated delivery of MMAE to irradiated tumor xenografts. Following
the initial 6 Gy dose to increase ACPP-mediated MMAE delivery,
2 doses of 3 Gy were given after ACPP–cRGD–MMAE. Even with
a total dose delivered of 12 Gy to HCT-116 tumors over 3 days,
the majority of HCT-116 tumors began to regrow in contrast to
combined treatment with ACPP–cRGD–MMAE. While the treatment regimens in the 3 xenograft experiments varied from
each other, a strength is that their conclusions consistently

MMAE-Mediated Radiosensitization

demonstrated that combining ACPP–cRGD–MMAE with IR
resulted in sustained tumor xenograft regression (Table 1).
ACPP-conjugated delivery of radiosensitizers is innovative
and of clinical signiﬁcance in that it offers a solution to the
problem of nonselective radiosensitization of molecules for not
only cancer cells but also surrounding normal tissue. In addition, it provides a mechanism for efﬁcient intracellular delivery
and release of the conjugated drug payload, that is, MMAE.
MMAE is conjugated to the polycationic cell-penetrating peptide
portion of ACPP through a cathepsin B–sensitive linker (valine–
citrulline; ref. 17). Once the ACPP peptide linker is cleaved in
the tumor microenvironment, the cell-penetrating peptide
MMAE is internalized and free MMAE released from lysosomes
through the action of cathepsin B. Such a therapeutic paradigm
can allow for the clinical development and testing of more
potent radiosensitizers, as systemic toxicity and collateral normal tissue damage would be decreased. Because MMP activity is
high in the tumor microenvironment, MMP-2/-9–targeted ACPP
may also be a broadly applicable tumor-selective delivery vehicle for radiosensitizers. Meanwhile, the only immediately clinically approved vehicle for MMAE delivery is brentuximab
vedotin, with a host of similar antibody–MMAE conjugates
undergoing clinical trial (11, 28). Our results showing radiosensitization by free MMAE in vitro suggest that antibody–
MMAE conjugates should show similar radiosensitization, as
the antibody is another mechanistic targeting vector for MMAE.
Viewed another way, IR may be a valuable adjunct to chemotherapy with antibody–drug conjugates.
Our work also lays the foundation for further reﬁnement of
radiation-guided ACPP delivery of potent tumoricidal and
radiosensitizing agents. IR results in changes in the tumor
microenvironment including alterations of tumor permeability
and retention, gene expression, tumor cell surface receptor
expression, and protease activity. The physics of IR allows for
IR to be speciﬁcally deposited to tumor tissue and can allow it to
serve as beaconing mechanism for systemically delivered therapeutic agents. Such a concept has been seen with combining IR
with oncolytic viruses, where IR enhances the ability of both
intratumoral and systemically delivered oncolytic viruses to
replicate in irradiated tumor microenvironment (29–32). IR
has also been used to induce the expression of neoantigens
within tumors that can function as receptors for peptide ligand–
targeted nanoparticles (33–36). Interestingly, MMP activity has
been reported to be induced in irradiated tumors, including
patient-derived rectal cancers (37–40). Moreover, the cRGDbinding integrin avb3 expression is also upregulated by IR and
modulates cell response to IR (41–44). While gelatin zymography of excised tumor xenografts did not reveal an increase in
gelatinase activity in irradiated tumors compared with their
nonirradiated counterparts, ratiometric PLGC(Me)AG linker
ACPP showed a trend toward increase Cy5:Cy7 emission ratio
in irradiated tumor xenografts compared with nonirradiated
tumor xenografts (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Our
ratiometric PLGC(Me)AG linker ACPP contains both Cy5
(polycationic side) and Cy7 (polyanionic side), and real-time
ratiometric monitoring of tumors in mice has demonstrated
tumor-speciﬁc cleavage of this ratiometric probe (19). While
Cy5 has increased tissue attenuation than Cy7, in our experience, the greater extinction coefﬁcient, quantum yield, and
chemical stability of Cy5 compared with Cy7 make up for the
somewhat greater attenuation (45). In addition, we have not

www.aacrjournals.org

found a ratiometric FRET donor–acceptor pair in which the
donor is Cy7 and the acceptor is about 100 nm longer in
wavelength.
An alternative explanation for the enhanced accumulation of
ACPP within irradiated tumors as opposed to nonirradiated
tumors is the concept of enhanced permeability and retention
(EPR) of systemically delivered macromolecular agents of 40
kDa (46–48). IR has been shown to decrease the tumor interstitial pressure, especially with delivery of doses >10 Gy. By
decreasing tumor interstitial pressure, IR can augment diffusion
of macromolecular drugs into the tumor. However, the ACPP–
cRGD–MMAE is only 6.9 KDa, so it may not be affected as much
by EPR. Using ratiometric ACPP probes, further optimization of
radiation dose fraction schedule may improve cleavage and
activation of ACPP through increased expression of cRGDbinding integrins and MMP-2/-9 activity or increased tumor
EPR (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Moreover, a radiation
ACPP could be engineered in which a ﬂexible peptide linker
region could be inserted that is cleaved by IR-induced tumor
protease activity. This would increase ACPP cleavage dependence upon IR-induced microenvironment proteases (Supplementary Fig. S7). Our results provide a conceptual basis for
IR-controlled ACPP to be developed that could deliver potent
radiosensitizers. In such a treatment paradigm, there would be
preferential accumulation of the radiosensitizer with the irradiated tumor and reduced bioavailability of the radiosensitizer
to normal tissue. Such technology is not limited to radiosensitizer delivery. IR could be used to induce a "proteolytic switch"
in the irradiated tumor target microenvironment to facilitate
localized delivery of systemically administered cytotoxic antitumor agents.
