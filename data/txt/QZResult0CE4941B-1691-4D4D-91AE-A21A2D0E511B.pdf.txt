Upon stimulation, dendritic cells (DCs) mature and migrate to draining lymph nodes to induce
immune responses1. As such, autologous DCs generated ex vivo have been pulsed with tumor
antigens and injected back into patients as immunotherapy. While DC vaccines have shown
limited promise in the treatment of patients with advanced cancers2–4 including glioblastoma
(GBM),5–7 the factors dictating DC vaccine efficacy remain poorly understood. Here we
demonstrate that pre-conditioning the vaccine site with a potent recall antigen such as tetanus/
diphtheria (Td) toxoid can significantly improve the lymph node homing and efficacy of tumor
antigen-specific DCs. To assess the impact of vaccine site pre-conditioning in humans, we
randomized patients with GBM to pre-conditioning with mature DCs8 or Td unilaterally before
bilateral vaccination with Cytomegalovirus pp65 RNA-pulsed DCs. We and other laboratories
have shown that pp65 is expressed in > 90% of GBM specimens but not surrounding normal
brain9–12, providing an unparalleled opportunity to subvert this viral protein as a tumor-specific
target. Patients given Td had enhanced DC migration bilaterally and significantly improved
survival. In mice, Td pre-conditioning also enhanced bilateral DC migration and suppressed tumor
growth in a manner dependent on the chemokine CCL3. Our clinical studies and corroborating
investigations in mice suggest that pre-conditioning with a potent recall antigen may represent a
viable strategy to improve antitumor immunotherapy.

To evaluate the influence of vaccine site pre-conditioning on DC migration clinically, we
conducted a randomized and blinded clinical trial in newly-diagnosed GBM (Extended Data
Fig. 1). Thirteen patients consented to this trial but only 12 were randomized as one
progressed prior to randomization (Extended Data Table 1). Patients were randomized to
unilateral vaccine site pre-conditioning with unpulsed, autologous DCs8 or Td, based upon
our hypothesis that it would induce inflammation at the vaccine site13. The accumulation of
injected DCs in vaccine site-draining lymph nodes (VDLNs) was significantly greater in
patients given Td (Fig. 1a). Moreover, Td-treated patients also showed a significant increase
in both PFS (Fig. 1b) and OS (Fig. 1c) compared to DC-treated patients. From the time of
diagnosis, patients in the DC cohort had a median PFS of 10.8 months and a median OS of
18.5 months. Thus, the median PFS and OS for the DC cohort were consistent with patients
treated with the standard of care14. Three censored patients from the Td cohort did not
progress and were alive at the time of survival analysis (> 36.6 months). Overall, these
prognostic factors varied across both treatment groups as expected in a small clinical trial.
However, there was no discernible trend across prognostic factors that would suggest these
factors alone account for the observed differences in survival between cohorts. Using the
both Curran et al. recursive partition analysis15 and the European Organization for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) nomogram16 for predicting outcome of patients with
GBM, Td-treated patients exceeded expected survival times by a far greater degree than did
DC-treated patients in both cases by nearly the same amount (Extended Data Table 1). The
vaccine responses in long-term survivors varied in durability, but pp65-specific immune
responses were detectable for several months in all long-term survivors. An increase in
pp65-specific interferon-γ spot-forming units (SFUs) from baseline did correlate with
overall survival and the two long-term survivors for which samples were available had the
highest increases in pp65-specific immune responses after vaccination. In addition, we
observed a striking association between DC migration to the VDLNs and PFS and OS (Fig.
1d) in patients with GBM receiving pp65 RNA-pulsed DC vaccines.

To validate these clinical results and understand the mechanistic underpinnings, we
performed analogous studies in a mouse model. Vaccine sites of Td-immune mice were
preconditioned with Td and then received a bilateral vaccine of ovalbumin (OVA) RNApulsed DCs. In a striking parallel to our clinical findings, Td-immune mice receiving Td
preconditioning had a three-fold increase in DCs within the afferent inguinal lymph nodes
(Fig. 2a). This effect was attributable to Td-specific recall responses as mice not primed
with Td (Td-naïve mice) did not display any increased DC migration to VDLNs (Fig. 2b).
Vaccination and preconditioning with other CD4-dependent protein antigens also increased
DC migration suggesting this may be a generalizable phenomenon (Extended Data Fig. 2).
Subsequent studies performed in Td-treated mice demonstrated that only selective depletion
of CD4+ T cells abrogated the increase in DC migration (Fig. 2c). The effect of enhanced
migration was also transferable to naïve mice administered Td-activated CD4+ T cells (Fig.
2d).

Author Manuscript

In patients with GBM randomized to unilateral Td pre-conditioning (Fig. 2e) and in mice
(Fig. 2f), we observed an increased uptake of 111In-labeled DCs in bilateral lymph nodes,
suggesting that Td pre-conditioning increased DC migration through systemic mediators.
Subsequent experiments revealed that Td-activated CD4+ T cells administered systemically
in naïve mice were also sufficient to increase bilateral DC migration (Extended Data Fig. 3).
Vaccine site pre-conditioning with unpulsed DCs or TNF-α8 only increased DC migration
ipsilaterally (Extended Data Fig. 4a and 4b).

Author Manuscript

Based on our observations that Td recall responses could induce bilateral DC migration and
that systemic administration of Td-activated CD4+ T cells were sufficient to recapitulate the
increased DC migration, we sought to examine the induction of CD4-dependent
inflammatory mediators in the serum of patients and mice following a recall response with
Td preconditioning. CCL3 was the only chemokine or cytokine to be elevated in both
patients and mice and had the greatest fold elevation of all chemokines in the serum of both
following Td preconditioning (Fig. 3a, Extended Data Fig. 5a–d).
To identify the site of the CCL3 production, we assayed the pre-conditioning sites in mice
and found high concentrations of this chemokine only unilaterally at the site of Td
preconditioning (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Subsequent experiments showed that CCL3
upregulation in the skin was dependent on the induction of the Td recall response (Extended
Data Fig. 6b) and was significantly reduced by CD4+ T cell depletion (Extended Data Fig.
6c). Induction of CCL3 by Td pre-conditioning remained elevated over time compared to
mice lacking Td recall responses (Extended Data Fig. 6d).

Author Manuscript

To evaluate the importance of CCL3 in mediating DC trafficking to VDLNs in vivo, we
immunized and boosted Ccl3−/− mice with Td as described above and found that the
migration of injected DCs to VDLNs in Ccl3−/− mice was significantly lower than in wildtype Td preconditioned mice (Fig. 3b, top). Endogenous migration experiments revealed that
resident Langerhans cells also did not migrate as efficiently in Ccl3−/− hosts following Td
pre-conditioning (Extended Data Fig. 7). To address the possibility that Td priming may
have failed in Ccl3−/− mice due to some earlier role of CCL3, we compared the CD4 Tdependent immune responses to Td in both wild-type and Ccl3−/− hosts and found no

differences in the ability of these two strains to mount anti-tetanus immune responses
following Td priming and boosting (Extended Data Fig. 8).
Our studies demonstrated that CD4+ T cells activated by the Td recall response were
sufficient to induce increased DC migration in naïve mice (Fig. 2d). However, Td-activated
CD4+ T cells could not rescue the limited DC migration in Ccl3−/− hosts indicating that
activated T cells were necessary, but not sufficient to increase DC migration (Fig. 3b,
bottom). Exogenous administration of CCL3 could rescue the limited DC migration in
Ccl3−/− mice, but only when the Td recall responses were induced (Fig. 3c), indicating that
the ability of Td pre-conditioning to increase DC migration to VDLNs was dependent on
both CD4+ recall responses and host-derived CCL3.

Alterations in CCL21 expression along the lymphatic endothelium in the skin take place in
the context of inflammation and have been associated with increased DC migration8.
Following Td pre-conditioning, higher levels of CCL21 in harvested skin sites were detected
in Td-treated wild-type mice compared to Ccl3−/− mice, and exogenous administration of
CCL3 rescued the diminished levels of CCL21 at the vaccine sites of Ccl3−/− mice only in
the context of Td recall responses (Extended Data Fig. 9a), which paralleled the requirement
of host CCL3 and Td recall responses for increased DC migration. Furthermore, Td preconditioning resulted in an increase in CCL21 within inguinal lymph nodes both ipsilateral
and contralateral to the side of Td preconditioning (Extended Data Fig. 9b). Although lymph
nodes contain high basal amounts of CCL21, we found CCL21 levels in bilateral inguinal
lymph nodes of Td-treated Ccl3−/− mice to be lower than that of wild-type mice.
Meanwhile, reconstitution of CCL3 back into Ccl3−/− mice in conjunction with the
induction of Td recall responses significantly increased the expression of CCL21 in VDLNs
(Extended Data Fig. 9c).
The apparent increase in PFS and OS for Td treated-patients prompted us to determine if Td
pre-conditioning could inhibit tumor growth in a murine model of established B16/F10OVA tumors. Pairwise comparisons revealed that tumor growth in Td + OVA-DC mice was
significantly delayed (Fig. 4a) in an antigen-dependent manner (Fig 4b). Td pre-conditioning
in Ccl3−/− mice, as expected, was unable to inhibit tumor growth (Fig. 4c). Similarly, plt
(paucity of lymph node T cell) mice that lack expression of CCL21 in the lymph nodes17,
also failed to suppress tumor growth (Fig. 4d), indicating that Td-enhancement of OVA-DC
vaccines also required intact CCL21 expression in the host.

Results from our trial appear to demonstrate that the modulation of CMV-specific DCs with
Td pre-conditioning increases their migratory capacity and may improve clinical outcomes
in patients with GBM. Corroborating studies in mice support these claims and underline
CCL3 as a novel and important mediator of increased DC migration to VDLNs, in addition
to its described roles in DC precursor mobilization to peripheral sites of inflammation18,19
and in guiding naïve CD8+ localization to sites of DC-CD4+ interactions in lymph nodes20.
Our preclinical findings suggest that increased DC migration was only observed in the
context of host CCL3 and Td recall responses. Similarly, we observed a slight increase in
CCL21 skin and bilateral VDLN levels in the context of both host CCL3 and Td recall,
which may play a role in DC homing to local lymph nodes. However, due to the already

high basal amount of CCL21 chemokine in draining lymph nodes, it is possible that
additional factors such as interactions between host CCL3 and CD4+ recall T cells are the
predominant contributors to the increased DC accumulation in VDLNs. Our findings also
suggest that DC migration should be further investigated as a predictive biomarker for
immunotherapy studies.

The clinical protocol and informed consent were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration and Institutional Review Board at Duke University. Adults with a newlydiagnosed WHO Grade IV GBM, who had a gross total resection and residual radiographic
contrast enhancement on post-resection magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) not exceeding 1
cm in diameter in two perpendicular axial planes, and a Karnofsky Performance Scale score
of ≥ 80, were eligible for the clinical study (FDA - IND-BB-12839, Duke IRB
Pro00003877, NCT00639639). Histopathology of all specimens was initially read as GBM,
but this diagnosis was re-confirmed by a second board-certified neuro-pathologist.
Histologic diagnosis included immunohistochemistry for MGMT protein expression. Benign
endothelial cells staining positive for MGMT served as the internal control21. MGMT
promoter methylation was performed by PCR. Based on published reports showing high
expression of CMV viral proteins in > 90% of GBM tumors9–12, we elected not to include
pp65 staining of tumor tissue as an eligibility criterion for this trial. All 13 patients on study
received a gross total resection defined as > 90% with residual contrast enhancement of <1
cm2, and steroid doses could not exceed 2 mg/day of dexamethasone. No patients received
intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or had 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) dye
used during resection. Thereafter, all patients completed a six week course of conformal
external beam radiotherapy (XRT) to a dose of 60 Gray (Gy) with concurrent temozolomide
(TMZ) at a targeted daily dose of 75 mg/m2/d. Upon completion of standard therapy, all
patients underwent an MRI for evidence of progressive disease. Those with evidence of
progressive disease or required steroid therapy in excess of physiological levels at the time
of vaccination were replaced. A total of 13 patients were enrolled and randomized prior to
the first cycle of standard-of-care 5-day TMZ (200 mg/m2/day), but one progressed before
randomization. For each vaccine 2 × 107 mature pp65 RNA-pulsed DCs in 0.4 mL of saline
were given intradermally in the groin. The first vaccination occurred on day 21 ± 2 of TMZ
cycle 1. Although some patients (n=5) were also randomized to receive an autologous
lymphocyte transfer, those patients did not show a significant improvement in progressionfree survival or overall survival. Patients given autologous lymphocytes were additionally
administered 3 × 107 cells/kg intravenously with acetaminophen (650 mg per os (po)) and
Benadryl (25–50 mg po) given 30–60 minutes before infusion. The first three DC vaccines
were given biweekly, and, at vaccine 4, patients were randomized to Td or unpulsed
autologous DCs and received 111In-labeled DCs for migration studies. Vaccine 4 and
additional monthly vaccines until tumor progression occurred on day 21±2 of successive
TMZ cycles. A minimum of six cycles of adjuvant TMZ were required as per standard-ofcare and continuation was at the discretion of the treating neuro-oncologist. Patients were

monitored for treatment-related toxicity, and none of the patients experienced any vaccine or
Td-related adverse events.
Human autologous DC generation for vaccination and production of pp65-LAMP/A64
mRNA
DCs were generated using the method of Romani et al.22,23, and after harvest the cells were
frozen and assessed for contamination and lineage purity as previously published24. The
1.932 kB pp65 full-length cDNA insert was obtained from Dr. Bill Britt (University of
Alabama-Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama) and RNA was generated and transfected as
previously reported23.
Human DC migration studies

Author Manuscript

DC migration studies were done at the fourth vaccination. Patients were randomized by side
to have one inguinal vaccination site pre-treated with either 1 × 106 unpulsed DCs or Td
toxoid (1 flocculation unit (Lf)). Saline was administered on the contralateral side.
Vaccination site pretreatment was done 6 to 24 hours before DC vaccination. DCs were
labeled with 10 μCi / 1 × 107 DC with 111In (GE Healthcare, Arlington Heights, IL) and
divided equally in the two sites. Gamma camera images (GE Infinia Hawkeye) were taken
immediately after injection and at 24 and 48 hours after injection to compare 111In-labeled
DC migration from the inguinal injection sites to the inguinal lymph nodes.
Progression-free and overall survival

Author Manuscript

The more recent Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST criteria) judge
progression by measuring the longest one-dimensional diameter and determine progression
by a 20% increase in this diameter25. Once progression is detected on MRI, other imaging
modalities such as positron emission tomography and a stereotactic brain biopsy of the
enhancing region are incorporated to aid in determining progression. A stereotactic brain
biopsy or resection demonstrating recurrence defines clinical progression. Progression-free
survival (PFS) was defined as the time until radiographic or clinical progression and was
censored at the last follow-up if the patient remained alive without disease progression.
Overall survival (OS) was defined as the time until death and was censored at the last
follow-up if the patient remained alive at the time of analysis. PFS and OS for all patients
were calculated from both the time of surgery and from randomization to vaccine site preconditioning.
Mice

All animal experiments were performed according to Duke University Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee-approved protocols. Female C57BL/6 wild-type, OT-I transgenic
mice, Ccl3−/−, and RFP and GFP transgenic mice (ubiquitin promoter) were obtained from
the Jackson Laboratory and were bred under pathogen-free conditions at Duke University
Medical Center. The plt strain was provided by M.D.G. and maintained at Duke University

Generation of murine bone marrow-derived DCs, electroporation, and phenotyping

Author Manuscript

Bone marrow-derived DCs were generated from 6–8 week old female C57BL/6 wild-type,
RFP+, or GFP+ transgenic mice and pulsed with OVA RNA as previously described23. For
phenotyping, anti-mouse PE-conjugated CD11c (HL3), CD80 (16-10A1), CD86 (GL1),
Ly-6G (1A8), MHC class II (I-Ab; AF6-120.1) and isotype controls (IgG1; G235-2356,
IgG2a,κ; R35-95) were from BD Pharmingen. Cells were washed, resuspended in PBS and
2% FBS, incubated at 4°C for 30 minutes, and washed again before use.
Vaccine site pre-conditioning and DC vaccination in mice

For Td immunization, female 6–8 week old C57BL/6 mice received a primary i.m. vaccine
of Td toxoid (Sanofi Aventis; Decavac®; 1Lf, 100 μL) administered bilaterally into the
quadriceps muscle (50 uL per leg). An i.m. booster (0.5 Lf, 50 μL) was administered two
weeks later. Vaccine site pre-conditioning with saline or Td toxoid (0.5 Lf) was given i.d.
two weeks after the booster and randomized to the right or left groin site. Mouse IgG
antibody responses to Td were measured by ELISA (Xpress Bio). Serum from immunized
mice was harvested two weeks following each immunization prior to the next booster
vaccine. DCs were resuspended at 1 × 106/100 μL PBS (Gibco) and administered i.d. on
both sides 0.8 cm from the groin crease 24 hours after i.d. pre-conditioning. DCs injected in
the groin ipsilateral to the Td pre-conditioning side were directly injected i.d. within the
erythematous nodule produced by Td pre-conditioning. For recall response experiments
using other protein antigen formulations, female 6–8 week old C57BL/6 mice received a
primary i.m. vaccine of Prevnar 13® (Pfizer, Pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine,
1.32 μg, 100 μL) and Pedvax HIB® (Merck, Haemophilus b conjugate vaccine, 1.5 μg, 100
μL) administered bilaterally into the quadriceps muscle (50 μL per leg). Vaccine site preconditioning with saline or the protein antigen (50 μL) was given i.d. two weeks later and
randomized to the right or left groin site. DC vaccines were given 24 hours later, and
migration to lymph nodes was assessed 48 hours later. As with Td pre-conditioning, DCs
injected in the groin ipsilateral to the pre-conditioning side were directly injected i.d. within
the erythematous nodule produced by those formulations. For comparisons of other preconditioning agents, female 6–8 week old C57BL/6 mice received a unilateral dose of
unpulsed, mature DCs (1 × 106 in 50 μL) or TNF-α (30 ng) administered i.d. at the groin site
24 hours prior to DC vaccination. Based on the previous work using these pre-conditioning
regimens, DC migration to bilateral inguinal lymph nodes was assessed 24 hours later. For
all other migration experiments, popliteal and inguinal LNs were harvested 48 hours postDC vaccination and digested for flow cytometry. The percent of migrating DCs was
enumerated by gating on fluorescent DCs in wild-type VDLNs. DCs from wild-type (GFP−
and RFP−) mice as negative controls before gating on fluorescent DCs within VDLNs to
account for background autofluorescent cells that may have appeared in the GFP channel.
For in vivo DC migration, a sample size (three per group) was based on empirical evidence
from previously published reports as the size necessary for adequate statistical analysis of
lymph nodes sampled26.

Depletion, adoptive transfer, and CCL3 reconstitution

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Female 6–8 week old C57BL/6 mice were initially depleted of cellular subsets once daily
(200 μg/mouse intraperitoneally) for three days prior to the first Td i.m. immunization. Antimouse CD4 (GK1.5) and anti-CD8 (2.43) antibodies were purchased from American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). Anti-mouse NK1.1 (PK136) and anti-CD19
(2D5) and control isotype depleting antibodies (IgG2a (2A3) and IgG2b (LTF-2)) were from
BioXCell. Maintenance doses of depletion antibodies were administered at three-day
intervals (200 μg intraperitoneally) until vaccine site pre-conditioning with Td two weeks
later. For adoptive transfer experiments, Td-activated CD4+ T cells (CD4Act) were induced
in donor female 6–8 week old C57BL/6 mice. Mice were primed (1Lf, 100 μL) and boosted
(0.5Lf, 50 μL) i.m. with Td two weeks apart. Three days after the i.d. Td pre-conditioning,
donor inguinal lymph nodes, skin injection sites, and spleens were harvested and processed
for negative isolation of CD4+ T cells (Miltenyi Biotec). Complementary sites from naïve
mice were harvested simultaneously and processed for negative isolation of CD4+ T cells
(CD4Naive). A final dose of 6 × 106 CD4+ T cells were administered intravenously into
recipient mice two days before i.d. vaccination with RFP+ DCs. For CCL3 reconstitution in
Ccl3−/− hosts, recombinant mouse CCL3 (R&D Systems) was administered intravenously
into the tail vein (10 μg/mouse) 12 hours prior to vaccination with RFP+ DCs. Ccl3−/− mice
that were Td-immune were given recombinant CCL3 12 hours following Td preconditioning at the vaccine site.
Tumor implantation experiments

For tumor implantation experiments, B16/F10-OVA cells were grown as previously
published27 and injected subcutaneously at a concentration of 2× 105 cells in 200 μL of PBS
in the flank of C57BL/6 mice 8 days before vaccine site preconditioning, the first
intradermal vaccine of OVA RNA-pulsed DCs, and autologous lymphocyte transfer (1:1
infusion of naïve: OT-I OVA-specific T cells). Randomization of mice occurred after tumor
inoculation prior to vaccine site pre-conditioning and the first DC vaccine first by
compilation and then by random sorting into various treatment cages. Mice received two
additional weekly vaccines of RNA-pulsed DCs on days 15 and 22. Ten days after tumor
implantation, flank sites were monitored daily for tumor growth, and tumor size was
measured every two days. Tumor volume (millimeters cubed) was calculated by the formula
(length × width2 × 0.52) in a perpendicular fashion. Mice were sacrificed when ulceration
occurred or when the tumor reached either 2 cm in any direction or 2000 mm3. Analysis of
tumor growth focused on follow-up assessments before significant dropout occurred. A
logarithmic transformation yielded a linear relationship between tumor volume and time for
all curves. A mixed effects linear model that accounted for correlation of measurements
within a mouse was used to examine the relationship between time and log [tumor volume +
1]. No blinding was done for these animal studies.

Murine lymph node digestion and quantification of fluorescent and endogenous DCs

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Harvested LNs were placed in 6-well culture plates containing 1 mL HBSS with Ca2+/Mg2+
(Gibco), digested for 35 min at 37°C with collagenase A (1 mg/mL; Roche) and DNaseI (0.2
mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich) and 20 mM EDTA (Invitrogen) was added for 5 minutes at room
temperature to stop the reaction26. Single cell suspensions were prepared, cells were
centrifuged (500 × g × 5 min) and resuspended in PBS with 2% FBS and stained with
murine APC-conjugated CD11c (BD Pharmingen; HL3). For quantification of RFP+ or
GFP+ counts in individual lymph nodes, samples were resuspended at an equal volume and
50 μL of counting beads (Invitrogen; 50,000 beads) were added to each sample. Cells were
gated first on murine CD11c+ cells and then RFP+ or GFP+ cells, and absolute cell counts/
lymph node were quantified using the following equation: RFP+ or GFP+ events × 50,000
beads/ # bead events. For endogenous DC migration experiments, cells were surface-stained
in PBS with 3% FBS, 10mM EDTA, 5% normal mouse serum, 5% normal rat serum and 1%
Fc Block (eBioscience; clone 93) and then intracellularly stained with anti-CD207 according
to the manufacture’s protocol (BD Cytofix/Cytoperm™ Kit). The cells were analyzed by BD

Expression of chemokines CCL3 and CCL21 in mice

Peripheral blood was collected 24 hours after vaccine site pre-conditioning prior to DC
vaccination. For patients, blood was collected in 10 mL venous collection tubes (BD),
allowed to clot, spun at 1,170 × g for 15 minutes, and serum was stored at −190°C. For
mice, blood was collected in microtainer tubes (BD) allowed to clot for 30 min, spun at
8,000 × g for 5 min, and serum was stored at −80°C. Multiplex cytokine and chemokine kits
were used for patient and mouse studies (cytokines and chemokines of interest for human,

manufacturer’s instructions.

Female 6–8 week old C57BL/6 or Ccl3−/− mice were immunized with Td as described
above. Twenty-four hours following Td pre-conditioning, both left and right skin sites and
inguinal lymph nodes were harvested. For protein isolation, skin and lymph node samples
were placed in pre-loaded bead lysis Eppendorf tubes (Next Advance) containing RIPA
buffer (Sigma) with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Mini Complete Protease Inhibitor
Cocktail Tablets, Roche Applied Science). Homogenization was performed with the Bullet

Blender at 4°C. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation, and chemokines were
quantified by ELISA. Quantikine kits (R&D Systems) were used for CCL3, and RayBiotech
ELISA kits were used for CCL21. Corresponding samples were run for total protein
concentration using the Bradford assay. CCL3 and CCL21 concentrations were normalized
across samples and expressed as pg per mg or ng per mg of total skin or lymph node protein.
Statistical analysis

Author Manuscript

Statistics were reviewed by biostatisticians and tested as described in figure legends. Cox
proportional hazard models were used to evaluate DC migration and clinical outcomes. The
Logrank test was used to compare Kaplan-Meier survival curves with censored patient data.
For in vivo DC migration and VDLN studies, individual patient and mouse inguinal lymph
nodes were treated as separate biological replicates, based on the underlying assumption that
unilateral vaccine site pre-conditioning may preferentially affect local draining lymph nodes
over non-draining sites. An unpaired two-sample student’s t test was used for two-group
comparisons. Paired t tests were used for comparisons between lymph nodes in the same
host. One-way ANOVA was used to assess differences among three or more groups with
post-hoc Tukey t tests for two-group comparisons. Wilcoxon rank sum analyses were
conducted for pairwise comparisons in serum cytokine/chemokine panels. Signed rank tests
were used to evaluate fold increase in chemokine levels. For tumor growth curves, a mixed
effects linear model was employed utilizing log-transformed curves and F-test for pairwise
comparisons of regression line slopes and mean tumor volumes on the first day of detectable
tumors (y-intercept). Repeated measures for calculation of slopes incorporated time between
detectable tumor until significant dropout occurred (maximal tumor size, ulceration, or
death). Mean tumor volumes at final time points when entire control cohort expired were
compared between two groups using an unpaired two-sample student’s t test. Asterisks
indicate level of significance (*P < 0.05, **P ≤ 0.01, ***P < 0.001, P > 0.05 not significant
(N.S.)).

a, Serum CCL3 fold increase over non-Td cohorts (patient, n = 6; mouse, n = 8 biological
replicates); signed rank test, P = 0.031 and P = 0.039. b, Left: DC migration in WT (n = 5)
vs. Ccl3−/− mice (n = 4), two sample t test, P = 0.023). Right: Td-activated CD4+ transfer
in Ccl3−/− hosts (n = 4 mice); two sample t test, P = 0.029. c, CCL3 and Td recall
responses rescue migration (n = 4 mice); one-way ANOVA, P < 0.0001; post-hoc Tukey t
test, Ccl3−/− Td + Td i.d. + CCL3 i.v. vs. Ccl3−/− Td + Td i.d. and vs. Ccl3−/− + CCL3
i.v., P = 0.007 and P = 0.001, respectively. b, c, biological replicates of individual right and
left iLNs. Representative of 3 experiments; mean ± s.e.m.; intradermal (i.d.); intramuscular
(i.m.); intravenous (i.v.).
