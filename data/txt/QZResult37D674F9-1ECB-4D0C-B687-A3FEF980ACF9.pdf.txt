Abstract
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common type of pancreatic malignancies. PDAC builds a tumor
microenvironment that plays critical roles in tumor progression
and metastasis. However, the relationship between chemotherapy
and modulation of PDAC-induced tumor microenvironment
remains poorly understood. In this study, we report a role of
chemotherapy-derived inﬂammatory response in the enrichment
of PDAC microenvironment with immunosuppressive myeloid
cells. Granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF) is a major cytokine associated with oncogenic KRAS in PDAC
cells. GM-CSF production was signiﬁcantly enhanced in various
PDAC cell lines or PDAC tumor tissues from patients after

treatment with chemotherapy, which induced the differentiation
of monocytes into myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC).
Furthermore, blockade of GM-CSF with monoclonal antibodies
helped to restore T-cell proliferation when cocultured with monocytes stimulated with tumor supernatants. GM-CSF expression
was also observed in primary tumors and correlated with poor
prognosis in PDAC patients. Together, these results describe a role
of GM-CSF in the modiﬁcation of chemotherapy-treated PDAC
microenvironment and suggest that the targeting of GM-CSF may
beneﬁt PDAC patients' refractory to current anticancer regimens
by defeating MDSC-mediated immune escape. Cancer Res; 75(13);

Introduction

Unfortunately, this procedure can be applied in only a small
population of selected patients that were characterized with high
outcome of preoperative chemotherapy (6, 7). Thus, new therapeutic strategies for improving chemotherapeutic response are
critically needed to improve the clinical outcomes in advanced
PDAC, which in turn depend on the deep understanding of
changes induced in tumor microenvironment under chemotherapeutic conditions. In this context, it has recently become clear
that anticancer chemotherapeutic agents can modify the tumor
microenvironment, and the therapeutic effects mediated by these
agents are considerably dependent on the host immunologic
reaction (8, 9). In addition, the complex interaction between
tumor cells and other cellular components of tumor microenvironment such as cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts and myeloid
cells has great impact on invasion, metastasis, and acquiring of
chemo-resistant phenotypes (10, 11). PDAC microenvironment
constitutes molecular and cellular components with inﬂammatory features, such as pancreatic stellate cells and immune cells,
which affect PDAC progress (12, 13). Accumulating evidence has
unveiled the role of KRAS oncogene in the formation of desmoplastic and inﬂammatory microenvironment via the secretion of
multiple cytokines and chemokines (14). Thus, the understanding of the interaction between tumor microenvironment and
immune cell and cytotoxic therapies is essential for the improvement of PDAC treatment.
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are heterogeneous
populations of immune cells derived from progenitor cells in

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is an aggressive
cancer characterized by high mortality and poor prognosis, where
in advanced cases the average of life expectancy is less than 1 year
(1, 2). A recent study of cancer incidence and mortality has
projected PDAC to become the second leading cause of cancerrelated death by 2030 in the United States (3). In spite of recent
progress in treatment strategies, the current protocols of chemotherapy regimens remain insufﬁcient to cure the patients (4, 5).
Recently, we and other groups have reported a new concept of
"adjuvant surgery" in which PDAC patients are treated with preoperative chemotherapy, followed by surgical resection, which
contributes to long-term survival for locally advanced cases (6, 7).

bone marrow, which accumulate in tumor microenvironment
via various pathologic mechanisms, and contribute to tumor
progression by damping T-cell immunity and promoting angiogenesis (15, 16). Cytokines such as colony-stimulating factors
(e.g., GM-CSF and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) are
key molecules involved in the generation of MDSCs (17, 18).
Oncogenic KRAS is the most frequently mutated gene in PDAC
and has been shown to be involved in PDAC development and
growth (19, 20). Importantly, oncogenic KRAS is associated
with overexpression of GM-CSF, which induces MDSC formation in PDAC microenvironments, which in turn prompt the
development and progression of PDAC in genetically engineered mouse models (21, 22). Moreover, targeted depletion
of MDSCs was effective to increase the intratumoral accumulation of activated T cells and thus improved the therapeutic
efﬁcacies of immunotherapy in murine models of PDAC and
other cancers (23). However, little is known about the role of
MDSCs in human PDAC, especially in clinical therapeutic
settings, for example, chemotherapy-treated conditions.
In the current study, we show phenotypic and functional
changes of monocytes under chemotherapy-treated human
PDAC conditions. Human monocytes differentiated into
HLA-DRlow/negative MDSC phenotype when cultured in conditioned medium (CM) of human PDAC cells. Moreover, HLADRlow/negative cell formation was enhanced when human monocytes were cultured in CM of chemotherapy-treated human
PDAC cells. Gene and protein expression of GM-CSF or other
inﬂammatory factors in human PDAC cell lines were upregulated after treatment with anticancer cytotoxic agents such as
gemcitabine and ﬂuorouracil (5-FU). Blockade of GM-CSF in the
supernatants of PDAC cell culture with speciﬁc monoclonal
antibodies resulted in recovery of T-cell proliferation when
cocultured with monocytes stimulated with PDAC CM. Consistent with these results, we found that PDAC tumor tissues in
chemotherapy-treated cancer patients recruited more cells that
express MDSC markers compared with nontreated group.
In conclusion, targeting of PDAC with chemotherapy may
activate inﬂammatory signals that induce the production of
multiple sets of cytokines and chemokines in tumor cells. Among
these, GM-CSF has emerged as a critical factor that link inﬂammatory signals with the creation of immunosuppressive microenvironment via the acceleration of monocytes differentiation
into MDSCs. Together, our results give a new insight into how
chemotherapy may results in counterproductive effects, and highlight the candidate molecules to be targeted in future improvement of PDAC treatment.

Materials and Methods
Ethics
Human PDAC samples were obtained from surgical specimens
after obtaining informed consent from all patients. Blood samples
were obtained from healthy volunteers and PBMCs were separated using cell separating tube (BD Biosciences). Both procedures
were ethically approved by the committees in the Institutional
Review Board of Hokkaido University Hospital (Sapporo, Japan;
No. 013-0389, 013-0390).
Human PDAC tissue samples
For tissue microarray (TMA), PDAC tissue samples were
obtained from 99 resected PDACs in our institute between

2630 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

1994 and 2005. TMAs were constructed as described in our
previous report (24). Patients without information about survival
or broken and poor samples were omitted from analysis. A total of
68 patients were subjected to analysis. The characteristics of
patients for TMA study are summarized in Supplementary Table
S1. Evaluation procedure was performed as previously reported
with a little modiﬁcation. The intensity of GM-CSF staining was
classiﬁed according to a three-level scale: 0, weak or equivalent
staining compared with normal pancreas; 1þ, strong and partial
staining to cytoplasm of cancer cell; 2þ, strong and diffuse
staining to cytoplasm. Scoring was evaluated by two independent
investigators.
The 15 patients that underwent surgery in our institute and
were evaluated (Fig. 5) are overlap cohorts described in our
previous report resected in our institute between 2006 and
2010 (25). The characteristics of these patients are summarized
in Supplementary Table S2–S3. Immunohistochemical testing
and evaluation of myeloid cells were performed according to
previous reports (25). Brieﬂy, ﬁve areas of most abundant myeloid cells distribution were selected in high-power ﬁeld (400).
Average counted numbers of areas were compared. All specimens
were evaluated by two independent investigators.
Cell lines
Human PDAC cell lines (Capan-1, Capan-2, PANC-1, MIAPaCa-2, and BxPC-3), human cervical cancer cell line (HeLa), and
human leukemia cell line (Jurkat) were purchased from ATCC.
PK-45-P and PK-1 were purchased from RIKEN. PCI-43 and PCI43-P5 were previously established from surgically resected primary carcinoma tissues in our institute (26). All cell lines were
cultured in an appropriate medium as indicated by manufactures
or references. For CM used in monocyte culture, Capan-1 and
PANC-1 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 (WAKO) supplemented
with 10% FBS (Cell Culture Bioscience), 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 10 mmol/L HEPES, 1% L-glutamine, 1 mmol/L sodium
pyruvate, 1% nonessential amino acids (all from Life Technologies), and 50 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol (WAKO) in accordance
with optimizing conditions for monocytes.
In vitro human monocyte culture
To examine the effects of PDAC-derived factors on monocyte
differentiation, we established the following in vitro models. For
normal condition, the supernatants of PDAC cell culture were
harvested when cells became 80% conﬂuent and passed through
0.2 mm ﬁlter (Sartourius Stedim Biotech). To mimic clinical
pharmacologic settings in PDAC patients, gemcitabine (1–30
mmol/L) or 5-FU (10 mg/mL) were applied at concentrations
similar to that used in clinic (1–30 mmol/L). PDAC cells were
pulsed with GEM or 5-FU for 60 minutes followed by washing 5
times with sterilized PBS and changing to fresh media. After 72
hours, supernatants were collected and passed through 0.2 mm
ﬁlter as described above. Human peripheral monocytes were
puriﬁed from PBMC of healthy donors using CD14þ selection
by magnetic cell sorting systems according to manufacturer's
protocols (Miltenyi Biotec) and cultured in the presence of supernatants prepared from normal PDAC or chemotherapy-treated
PDAC cells for 6 days. On day 6, gene expression and protein
analysis were evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR or ﬂow cytometry,
respectively. In some experiments, cytokines in the supernatants
of PDAC cell culture were neutralized using anti-human GM-CSF
(clone BVD2-23B6; Biolegend, 10 mg/mL), anti-human IL6 (clone

Flow cytometry
Single-cell suspensions were used for ﬂow cytometry analysis
after treatment with human FcR blocker (Miltenyi Biotec) or
anti-mouse CD16/32 (BD Biosciences) and stained with appropriate ﬂuorescent antibodies according to manufacturer's
instructions. Fluorescent antibodies used for the staining of
human cell surface markers were purchased from BD Biosciences (anti-HLA-DR and anti-CD15), Beckman Coulter
(anti-CD11b and anti-CD33), Miltenyi Biotec (anti-CD14), or
Biolegend (anti-CCR2 and anti-CX3CR1). Fluorescent antibodies used for the staining of mouse cell surface markers were
purchased from Biolegend (anti-CD11b and anti-Gr1). Samples were run on FACScanto II (BD Biosciences) and analyzed
using FlowJo software V7.6.5.

Western blotting
Total cell lysates were prepared using RIPA buffer supplemented with protease inhibitors aprotinin and phenylmethylsulfonylﬂuoride. Protein samples were resolved using 10% SDS-PAGE and
were then transferred to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane (GE
Healthcare). Membranes were probed with primary antibodies
against target molecules followed by reaction with secondary
antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for appropriate
incubation time. Antibodies against ERK, p-ERK, AKT, and p-AKT
were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology; antibodies
against b-actin were purchased from Millipore; secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Immunoreactivity was detected by an Enhanced Chemiluminescence
Detection System (GE Healthcare). Equal loading of proteins was
conﬁrmed with b-actin.

Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit
(Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and used for
cDNA synthesis (Prime Script RT Master Mix, Takara Bio). cDNA
products were used to amplify target genes using Power SYBR
Green (Life Technologies) and speciﬁc primer (Supplementary

cultured in normal medium, while monocytes that were differentiated in the presence of Capan-1 or PANC-1 supernatants
formed ﬂoating immature cells (Fig. 1B). Previous reports suggested that PDAC induces the accumulation of MDSCs in tumor
regions in genetically engineered mouse models (21, 22). Monocyte-derived MDSCs (mo-MDSCs) from cancer patients express
the monocyte macrophage marker CD14 and the common myeloid marker CD33, but lack or show lower expression of mature
myeloid markers HLA-DR (27). We found that human monocytes
expressed CD14 and CD33, while HLA-DR expression was relatively lower in monocytes cultured in the presence of PDAC
supernatants compared with normal medium (Fig. 1C and D).
Mo-MDSCs suppress T-cell immunity via nitric oxide synthase 2
(NOS2) or Arginase 1 (ARG1; refs. 28, 29). Thus, we next evaluated the expression levels of these two enzymes in monocytes
induced by PDAC CM. PDAC CM–treated monocytes showed
high expression of both NOS2 and ARG1 (Fig. 1E). In addition,
we examined the expression of other myeloid lineage markers,
and found that PDAC CM–treated monocytes express the common myeloid marker CD11b, chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2), but
lack the expression of granulocyte or tissue resident macrophage
marker CD15 or CX3C chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1;

Fig. 1F; ref. 30). Together, these data demonstrated that human
peripheral monocytes differentiated into mo-MDSCs when stimulated with PDAC CM.
The supernatants of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells enhance
the differentiation of human monocytes into MDSCs
Next, we examined whether the differentiation patterns of
monocytes are altered in chemotherapy-treated PDAC microenvironment. To do so, we established in vitro culture model using
Capan-1 cell line treated with gemcitabine or 5-FU (Fig. 2A).
Interestingly, after 6 days of culture, monocytes showed morphologic changes when cultured in the supernatants of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells, represented by increased diameters (Fig.
2B and Supplementary Fig. S1) and formation of cytoplasmic
vacuoles that were not observed in monocytes cultured in normal
medium or normal PDAC supernatant (Fig. 2C). These monocytes showed high forward and side scatter voltage signals in ﬂow
cytometry analysis, which was consistent with gross examination
(Fig. 2D). In addition, the HLA-DRlow/negative fraction was
increased in monocytes differentiated in the supernatants of
chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells (Fig. 2D and E and Supplementary Fig. S1). These changes are consistent with the phenotype

of HLA-DRlow/negative immature monocytes that have been previously reported (27). To evaluate the immunosuppressive features
of monocytes differentiated in gemcitabine-treated PDAC CM, we
analyzed expression levels of ARG1, IL-10, TGF-b1, and NOS2.
Although no signiﬁcant changes were observed in the expression
of ARG1, IL-10, or TGF-b1 (data not shown), NOS2 expression
was signiﬁcantly increased in monocytes differentiated in gemcitabine-treated PDAC CM (Fig. 2F). MDSCs are usually characterized by lack or low expression of HLA-DR and high expression of
NOS2 (28, 31). Accordingly, these data suggest that the supernatants of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells accelerate the differentiation of monocytes into MDSCs with enhanced molecular
patterns.
Treatment with chemotherapy ampliﬁes the expression of GMCSF and other inﬂammatory cytokines in PDAC cells via the
activation of MAPK signaling pathway and NF-kB transcription
MDSCs are immunosuppressive myeloid cells that contribute
to tumor progression and immune evasion. Accumulating evidence has unveiled that GM-CSF and other tumor-derived molecules are necessary for the induction of preferential expansion of
MDSCs in tumor microenvironment (32–34). To identify factors
in the supernatants of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells responsible for monocytes differentiation into MDSCs, we investigated
expression proﬁles of various cytokines and chemokines in
Capan-1 or PANC-1 cell lines. Following stimulation with gemcitabine or 5-FU, several cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in both cell lines (Fig. 3A and B and Supplementary Fig.
S2). In particular, the expression of GM-CSF, IL6, and IL8 was
increased in the supernatants of chemotherapy-treated Capan-1
cells (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S3). In the next experiment,
we focused on GM-CSF since both cell lines showed a signiﬁcant
enhancement in GM-CSF production after treatment with gemcitabine or 5-FU. In addition, GM-CSF is well known for its role as
an essential factor of MDSC proliferation and differentiation in
PDAC (22). In oncogenic KRAS-mediated PDAC murine model,
GM-CSF is regulated by MAPK or PI3K signaling pathway, two
major downstream pathways of KRAS oncogene (21). Thus, we
next compared the activation status of these two pathways
through the evaluation of ERK phosphorylation as an indicator
for MAPK pathway, or AKT for PI3K pathway in normal or
chemotherapy-treated conditions. We found that gemcitabine
treatment enhances the phosphorylation of ERK (Fig. 3D) but
not AKT (data not shown) in a time-dependent manner. NF-kB
is a major transcription factor that induces the expression of
inﬂammatory cytokines, including GM-CSF (35, 36). Thus, we
next examined whether gemcitabine treatment may induce promoter activities of NF-kB in PDAC cells. In a luciferase assay, we
found that NF-kB–luciferase activities were enhanced after chemotherapy treatment (Fig. 3E). These data indicate that chemotherapy enhances the production of multiple inﬂammatory cytokines including GM-CSF by amplifying the activation status of
MAPK signaling pathway and NF-kB promoter activities in PDAC
cells.
Neutralization of GM-CSF in the supernatants of
chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells blocks monocyte
differentiation into MDSCs and helps recovery of T-cell
proliferation
The supernatants of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells were
enriched with GM-CSF, and induced morphologic and pheno-

typic changes in monocytes. To further examine the contribution of GM-CSF in these changes, we utilized a speciﬁc monoclonal antibody to neutralize GM-CSF in chemotherapy-treated
Capan-1 CM. Interestingly, we found that the neutralization of
GM-CSF has resulted in decreased forward and side scatter
voltage signals as well as HLA-DRlow/negative fractions (Fig.
4A), and abolished the formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles that
were observed in the case of gemcitabine-treated Capan-1 CM
(Fig. 4B). These data indicate that GM-CSF is one of the major
factors of monocyte differentiation in the supernatants of
chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells.
MDSCs are heterogeneous populations of cells that are deﬁned
by their ability to potently suppress T-cell response by NOS2dependent mechanism (31). As described above, the supernatants
of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells were enriched with GM-CSF,
and induced high expression of NOS2 in MDSCs differentiated
from monocytes. To conﬁrm the immunosuppressive potential of
MDSCs generated from monocytes in the presence of PDAC
supernatants, we cocultured these MDSCs with CD4þ or CD8þ
T cells and examined T-cell aggregation and proliferation after
stimulation. Interestingly, MDSCs generated from monocytes by
normal Capan-1 CM suppressed aggregation and proliferation of
stimulated CD4þ or CD8þ T cells, which was further suppressed
by MDSCs generated by gemcitabine-treated Capan-1 CM (Fig. 4C
and D and Supplementary Fig. S4). Importantly, the neutralization of GM-CSF in gemcitabine-treated Capan-1 CM was effective
to abolish these immunosuppressive functions and contribute to
the recovery of T-cell function as observed by enhanced aggregation and proliferation (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Fig. S4).
Together, these data highlight the role of GM-CSF in the enhancement of MDSCs formation in chemotherapy-treated PDAC microenvironment, and suggest that the neutralization of GM-CSF may
contribute to block the formation of MDSCs and thus the recovery
T-cell response.
GM-CSF is expressed in various human PDAC cell lines and
tumor tissues and serves as a poor prognostic indicator for
PDAC patients
To investigate whether GM-CSF expression is a common
feature of PDAC cells, we examined the expression of GM-CSF
in human samples. Quantitative PCR analysis showed high
expression of GM-CSF in all PDAC cell lines with some variations (Fig. 5A). Next, immunohistochemistry staining was used
to examine protein levels of GM-CSF in PDAC tissues of 68
resected primary tumors by TMA. PDAC tissues also showed
variety in GM-CSF expression (Fig. 5B). The intensity of GMCSF staining was classiﬁed as high or low as described in
Materials and Methods (Fig. 5B and C), and scores were used
to generate Kaplan–Meier survival curve. We found that survival rates were signiﬁcantly lower in patients with high expression of GM-CSF (Fig. 5D). These data suggest that GM-CSF, a
MDSC-inducing cytokine, is generally expressed in human
PDAC, and correlates with poor prognosis.
Finally, to examine the impact of tumor microenvironment on
MDSCs differentiation in human PDAC tissues under chemotherapeutic conditions, we assessed MDSC marker expression in
tumor-inﬁltrating myeloid cells in PDAC patients treated with
preoperative chemotherapy including gemcitabine in our institute (Supplementary Table S3). We found that tumor-inﬁltrating
CD14þ cells in PDAC patients treated with preoperative chemotherapy show no or weak expression of HLA-DR compared with

patients without preoperative chemotherapy treatment (Fig. 5E
and F). These data indicate that CD14þHLA-DR cells constitute a
dominant fraction in PDAC tissues following chemotherapy, an
observation that might be a contrast to a previous mouse study
(37). Furthermore, we investigated the expression of CD66b, a
marker of granulocytic MDSC (G-MDSC; ref. 38), and found that
the frequencies of tumor-inﬁltrating CD66bþ cells were signiﬁcantly higher in PDAC patients after chemotherapy treatment
(Fig. 5G and H). On the other hand, no signiﬁcant difference was
observed in the frequencies of CD68þ macrophages between the
two groups (Supplementary Fig. S5). Taken together, these results

suggest that chemotherapy treatment accelerates the formation of
both mo-MDSCs and G-MDSCs in human PDAC tissues, consistent with previous experiments.

Discussion
Most of PDAC cancer cases are diagnosed at late stages, which
make surgical resection of the tumor or the organ difﬁcult if not
impossible (39). Chemotherapy has been suggested as a possible
strategy for the treatment of PDAC patients; however, clinical
response mediated by anticancer cytotoxic agents against PDAC is

so limited, and it is unlikely that chemotherapy alone will provide
durable clinical beneﬁt for the majority of PDAC patients. Thus,
new combination protocols are suggested to gain cumulative or
synergistic beneﬁt in large population of patients. One good
example is the treatment with radical surgery, which was accompanied by favorable clinical outcomes in some clinical cases (6, 7).
Moreover, recent progress has been achieved in the protocols of
"neoadjuvant chemotherapy" against PDAC (40, 41). These new
protocols enable the analysis of molecular and pathologic patterns
of chemotherapy-treated PDAC. For example, recent preoperative
chemotherapy protocols helped to identify the molecular patterns of T cells, showing increased accumulation in tumor tissues
in PDAC or oesophageal cancer patients (25, 42,43). In addition, in
this study we have reported for the ﬁrst time the distribution of
MDSC markers in PDAC patients after chemotherapy treatment, in

2636 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

which MDSCs were the dominant cells in cancer regions. However,
the real therapeutic effects of chemotherapy in PDAC treatment
still poorly understood, since a large proportion of PDAC patients develop chemoresistance and thus cannot receive surgical
therapy. Therefore, further studies are critically needed to identify
the molecular mechanism of chemoresistance in PDAC.
It is now well established that the antitumor activities of
chemotherapy considerably rely on the complex interaction
between tumor and immune system of the host (9, 44). Moreover,
accumulating evidence has unveiled the importance of the interaction between tumor cells and myeloid cells in inducing chemoresistance and metastasis (11, 45). This is also applicable in the
case of PDAC, and the deep understanding of this complex
interaction in tumor microenvironment is a key concept for the
improvement of chemotherapeutic response against PDAC. To

understand how PDAC cells inﬂuence tumor microenvironment
in chemotherapy-treated condition, we ﬁrst analyzed monocyte
differentiation patterns using in vitro culture models. When stimulated with the supernatants of chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells,
human monocytes differentiated into immunosuppressive cells
that resemble MDSCs, showing similar morphology and shared
the same molecular markers. Interestingly, the supernatants of
chemotherapy-treated PDAC cells were found to be enriched
with GM-CSF and other inﬂammatory factors that induce the
differentiation of monocytes into MDSCs. Consistent with this,

www.aacrjournals.org

immunostaining of tumor tissues of PDAC patients treated with
chemotherapy has shown enhancement in MDSC markers compared with normal tissues. Thus, chemotherapy itself may result in
counterproductive effects in which the formation of immunosuppressive and tumorigenic myeloid cells is enhanced at the
microenvironment of PDAC.
MDSCs are a heterogeneous population of immature myeloid cells that negatively regulate the antitumor immune
responses (15). MDSCs also support tumor immune evasion
by suppressing T-cell immunity and promote angiogenesis and

Mechanism of chemotherapymediated induction of MDSCs. A
scheme of mechanism by which

tumor progression (21, 22, 46). Accumulation of MDSCs has
been correlated with tumor progression in patients (39). In
addition, a recent report has suggested that MDSCs contribute
to senescence evasion and chemoresistance in tumor (11). In
PDAC, MDSCs were found to be induced by MAPK or PI3K
pathway–dependent GM-CSF, and signiﬁcantly correlated with
tumor development and prognosis (21, 22). Importantly, we
have found that GM-CSF production was dramatically
enhanced in several PDAC cell lines as well as tumor tissues
in PDAC patients after treatment with chemotherapy, which
was accompanied by increased frequencies of MDSCs. One
possible mechanism is the activation of MAPK and NF-kB
signaling pathway as a consequent of chemotherapy-induced
DNA-damage response (47). However, detailed mechanism
should be elucidated in future studies.
GM-CSF may play two different roles at the tumor microenvironment of PDAC. First, GM-CSF may help to induce or
activate anticancer immune responses through the priming of
immunostimulatory dendritic cells. On the basis of this concept, GVAX, a GM-CSF gene-transferred tumor cell vaccine, has
been developed for the treatment of advanced PDAC patients,
but the clinical outcome was lower than what was expected
(48). Alternatively, GM-CSF may induce the formation of
MDSCs. One possible mechanism of these conﬂicting roles of
GM-CSF is the enrichment of PDAC microenvironment with
danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP) after chemotherapy treatment. DAMPs are released from tumor cells killed by
anticancer cytotoxic agents, and signaling mediated by these
DAMPs may be involved in the alteration of cellular differentiation pattern (49, 50), which should be clariﬁed in future
studies.
Our data indicate that MDSCs were increased after treatment
of PDAC with chemotherapy, which was related to enhancement in GM-CSF production. The neutralization of GM-CSF
with antibodies was effective to reduce MDSC frequencies, and
help the recovery of T-cell function (Fig. 6). Depletion of
MDSCs has been recently suggested for PDAC treatment
(23). In this context, the targeting of GM-CSF may constitute
an additional option to further improve current protocols of
PDAC treatment.

2638 Cancer Res; 75(13) July 1, 2015

In conclusion, our data identify a role of chemotherapy-derived
inﬂammatory response, in particular GM-CSF, in the enrichment
of PDAC microenvironment with MDSCs. Here, we suggest that
the targeting of MDSCs by direct depletion and/or the neutralization of tumor-derived GM-CSF in combination with current
therapeutic regimens constitute a promising strategy for the
treatment of PDAC patients.
