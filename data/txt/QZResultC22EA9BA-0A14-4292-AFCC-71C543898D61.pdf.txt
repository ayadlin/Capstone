monotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC who had developed disease proand the response rate of erlotinib-treated patients in subpopulations defined by
other patient characteristics before U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.

METHODS. A total of 229 patients were enrolled and treated with the standard
dose of erlotinib (150 mg once daily). The coprimary objectives were to characterize the overall response rate (ORR) and overall survival (OS) associated with
erlotinib therapy in this group and in patient subsets defined by tobacco history.
Secondary objectives were to assess safety, to characterize OS and ORR in patient
subpopulations, and to determine duration of time on treatment. Patients could
remain on study up to 9 months after approval.

RESULTS. The ORR was 8.3% (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.2–2.4%). The
ORR in never-smokers, previous smokers, and current smokers was 28.6% (95%
CI, 13.2–50.6%), 6.0% (95% CI, 3.0–10.4%), and 7.3% (95% CI, 2.0–19.0%), respectively. The median OS for all patients was 6.3 months (95% CI, 4.7–8.0 months).
In previous and current smokers, the median survival was 5.2 months (95% CI,
4.2–7.3 months) and 6.3 months (95% CI, 3.6–9.2 months), respectively, and was
not reached in never-smokers. The median duration of treatment was 10.6 weeks.
One (0.4%) interstitial lung disease-like event was reported.

CONCLUSIONS. No new safety signals were noted. The observed ORR and survival
data are consistent with results from the pivotal trial BR.21. Cancer 2008;112:

mainstay of treatment for advanced NSCLC, appears
to have reached a plateau of therapeutic efficacy.5,6
Therapies that target proteins implicated in the
development and progression of cancer have demonstrated efficacy. One of the most intensively investigated targeted therapies includes those directed
against members of the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which includes HER-1/epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) and HER-2. The HER family
has been implicated in the development and progression of multiple cancers, including breast cancer,
head and neck cancer, and NSCLC.7–9 Preclinical studies have demonstrated that, in malignant cells, EGFR
downstream signaling pathways are often dysregulated.10 The strongest evidence for a direct role of
HER signaling in tumorigenesis is based on findings
that EGFR is more highly expressed in tumors than in
normal tissue.11 Although EGFR is expressed at low
levels in normal lung tissue, in NSCLC patients, EGFR
is expressed at higher levels in 13% to 80% of
tumors.12 Consequently, EGFR was considered a good
candidate for targeted NSCLC therapy.
Erlotinib (Tarceva; Genentech, South San Francisco, Calif) is an orally available, small molecule
inhibitor of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity. It is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as monotherapy for treating locally
advanced or metastatic NSCLC in patients who have
failed at least 1 prior chemotherapy regimen, and in
combination with gemcitabine for treating locally
advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic
cancer.13 In the randomized, double-blind pivotal
trial (BR.21) that included 731 patients with recurrent
NSCLC, patients treated with erlotinib demonstrated
prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
survival (OS) compared with placebo-treated
patients.14 In the BR.21 study, the median survival
for the overall population improved by 42.5%, from
4.7 months to 6.7 months (hazards ratio of 0.71;
P < .0001). As assessed by both response and survival, the BR.21 study suggested that patients with no
prior tobacco exposure and patients of Asian descent
respond well to erlotinib. Although patients in the
BR.21 study who had adenocarcinoma appeared to
have a higher response rate than patients with squamous cell carcinoma (13.9% vs 3.8%), the survival
benefit was similar for the 2 subpopulations.
Based on the BR.21 study, the current open-label,
single-arm, advanced access, phase 3b trial was
initiated before the regulatory approval of erlotinib.
It was designed to examine the efficacy and safety of
erlotinib monotherapy in patients with advanced
NSCLC who had developed disease progression after
previous chemotherapy and to characterize the dura-

tion of survival and response rate of erlotinib-treated
patients in subpopulations defined by other patient
characteristics, including histology, sex, race/ethnicity, and EGFR mutation status.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study Design
The current study was a phase 3b, multicenter, openlabel, expanded access clinical study of daily oral
erlotinib in patients with advanced (inoperable stage
IIIb or IV) NSCLC who had developed disease recurrence after standard chemotherapy (determined
according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM Staging System). This trial was designed to
provide patients access to erlotinib before FDA approval and to examine the benefit in several subsets
of patients.
Eligible patients were age 18 years with inoperable and incurable, locally advanced, recurrent, or
metastatic NSCLC; who had developed disease recurrence after standard chemotherapy (combination
chemotherapy such as 2-drug combination chemotherapy or a single-agent chemotherapy agent for
patients who were elderly or had poor performance
status); who were able to receive oral medications;
who had recovered from the toxic effects of prior
therapy; who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 3; and
who had adequate cardiac, hematologic, hepatic, and
renal function (granulocyte count 1.0 3 109/L,
platelet count 75 3 109/L, serum bilirubin <1.5 3
upper limit of normal [ULN], aspartate aminotransferase [AST] <2 3 ULN [unless elevation was clearly
because of liver metastases; then AST had to be
<5 3 ULN], and serum creatinine 1.5 mg/dL).
Patients were ineligible if they had unstable systemic disease (including active infection; unstable
angina; congestive heart failure; myocardial infarction within the last 6 months; or hepatic, renal, or
metabolic disease); prior therapy with any systemic
HER-1/EGFR small molecule or other investigational
agents in this class; a history of another malignancy
within the past 2 years unless the malignancy had
been adequately treated and was associated with a
5-year anticipated survival of 90%; known central
nervous system metastases that had not yet been
definitively treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy
or that were symptomatic or unstable; or were pregnant or nursing.
During the treatment period, patients received
single-agent erlotinib until disease progression at the
approved standard recommended dosage for patients
with NSCLC (150 mg/day). Patients were removed
from treatment if they experienced unacceptable

toxicity or were unwilling or unable to comply with
study requirements. Dose reduction or interruption
of erlotinib for grade 3 to 4 diarrhea or rash or for
any grade of pulmonary events could occur at any
time during the study (in 50-mg decrements).
Disease was assessed within 30 days of the
initiation of study therapy and was reassessed at
intervals determined by the investigator and based
on standard practices. Overall best response and date
of disease progression were determined by study
investigators.

RESULTS

Study Objectives
The primary objectives of the current study were to
characterize the best overall response rate (ORR) and
the duration of survival in all patients and in subsets
of NSCLC patients defined by their previous tobacco
exposure. The secondary objectives were to evaluate
safety in the patient population through the assessment of serious adverse events (SAEs) and adverse
events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation
and to characterize the duration of survival and
response rate of erlotinib in subpopulations of
patients defined by other patient characteristics,
including histology, sex, and race/ethnicity; and to
characterize the duration of time on treatment.
Safety was assessed by analyzing SAEs and all
AEs leading to discontinuation from the study. SAEs
and AEs were graded according to National Cancer
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
Events (NCI-CTCAE; version 3.0).15 Investigators
assessed whether there was a reasonable possibility
that erlotinib caused or contributed to the AE.

Demographic

Statistical Methods
The original sample size of 5000 patients was chosen
so that relatively uncommon safety events could be
assessed, and so that patient subgroups could be analyzed for the primary endpoints. Because the FDA
approved erlotinib sooner than anticipated (November 2004), the study was terminated after 233
patients had enrolled. Therefore, because of insufficient data, it was not possible to conduct all the
intended analyses.
The duration of survival was defined as the time
from the initiation of erlotinib treatment until death
from any cause. For patients who were discontinued
from the study, survival was censored at the date of
last contact. Kaplan-Meier methodology was used to
estimate the survival rate, median survival time, and
95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Overall best
responses as determined by investigators were summarized and the 95% Blyth-Still-Casella exact CIs
were calculated.

Patients and Demographics
Between August 2004 and November 2004, 233
patients were enrolled at 94 sites in the U.S. A total
of 229 patients (98.3%) received the study drug (Table 1). Four patients were not treated because they
refused medication, were noncompliant, or were lost
to follow-up before receiving study drug. At baseline,

the median patient age was 68 years. The majority of
patients were white (85.6%) and were former or current smokers (90.8%). Of those patients with a history of smoking, they had smoked for a mean of 39.4
years, and >80% had accumulated >20 pack-years of
smoking. The most common cancer histology was
adenocarcinoma (45%), followed by squamous cell
carcinoma (33.6%). A total of 46.7% of patients had
received 2 lines of therapy; the majority (83.4%)
had received prior platinum, and 38% had received
both platinum and a taxane. Nearly 31% of patients
had an ECOG PS of 2 or 3.

Efficacy
Of the 229 patients with advanced, recurrent NSCLC
who received erlotinib monotherapy, 3 patients
achieved a complete response and 16 achieved a partial response (Table 2). At the time of study termination, 137 patients (59.8%) had died (Table 3). The
median duration of survival was 6.3 months (95% CI,

4.7–8.0 months), and the best ORR was 8.3% (95%
CI, 5.2–12.4%) (Table 2). In those patients who had
never smoked, the ORR was 28.6% versus 6.0% in
previous smokers and 7.3% in current smokers (Table
2). For previous smokers, the median duration of survival was 5.2 months (95% CI, 4.2–7.3 months) and
for current smokers it was 6.3 months (95% CI, 3.6–
9.2 months) (Table 3). For patients who had never
smoked, the median survival was not reached.

were observed in patients age 65 years, female
patients, patients with adenocarcinoma or squamous
cell carcinoma, and patients who had smoked 20
pack years (Table 4).
The median duration of treatment, a secondary
efficacy outcome measure of this study, was 10.6
weeks; the 25% and 75% percentiles were 5.4 weeks
and 21.0 weeks, respectively.

Safety and Tolerability
Overall, erlotinib was well tolerated. Eight patients
(3.5%) died during the study because of an AE. One
of these AEs, interstitial lung disease, was determined
by the investigator to be related to therapy with erlotinib. The total incidence of nonfatal SAEs was 39.3%
(Table 5). The total incidence of NCI-CTCAE grade 3
or 4 SAEs was 33.7%. The most common SAE was
pneumonia (7.9%) (Table 5). Six SAEs (2.6%) were
considered by investigators to be related to the study
drug. Of these 6 patients, 3 (1.3%) had diarrhea, 1
(0.4%) had pneumonia, 1 (0.4%) had uveitis, 1 (0.4%)
had a drug interaction, and 1 (0.4%) had dehydration.

Of the 229 treated patients, 209 patients (91.3%)
discontinued taking erlotinib before the study ended.
Disease progression accounted for nearly 60% of
those discontinuations (Table 6). Approximately 19%
of patients discontinued the study drug because of
AEs and SAEs (Table 6). Two of these events (0.9%)
(1 case of pneumonia and 1 case of dehydration)
were suspected by the investigator to be related to
erlotinib treatment. Diarrhea and rash were the most
common treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation (5.3%).
Of the 229 treated patients, 45 (19.7%) required
an erlotinib dose reduction; 32 patients (14.0%) had
a dose reduction to 100 mg/day, 11 patients (4.8%)
had a dose reduction to 50 mg/day, and 1 patient
(0.4%) had a dose reduction to 25 mg/day. For 1
patient, the lowest dose was not recorded.

DISCUSSION
This multicenter, open-label, phase 3b trial of erlotinib in patients with recurrent NSCLC was designed
to examine the efficacy and safety of erlotinib monotherapy before its regulatory approval. Because of the
approval of erlotinib in November of 2004, enrollment in the trial was prematurely terminated. Conse-

quently, instead of the expected accrual of 5000
patients, only 233 were enrolled. At the time of this
final analysis, 60% of patients had died and therefore
the data are mature.
Overall, baseline characteristics were similar to
those reported in the pivotal BR.21 trial, a placebocontrolled study of erlotinib in patients with
advanced or metastatic NSCLC who had failed prior
chemotherapy.14 Although compared with BR.21 this
study had fewer younger patients, fewer patients
who had never smoked, and fewer patients of Asian
ethnicity, the final efficacy results from this trial are
comparable to those of the BR.21 trial. In that study,

the ORR was 8.9%, the median duration of survival
was 6.7 months, and the median duration of treatment in the erlotinib arm was 9.6 weeks. Thus, it
would appear that in this trial, which mimics a realworld clinical setting, erlotinib has an efficacy similar
to that which has been observed in the randomized
phase 3 clinical trial.
Although only 21 patients who had never
smoked were enrolled in this trial, which is consistent with previous findings, erlotinib-treated patients
who had never smoked survived longer and had a
better response rate than current smokers or those
who had smoked previously (see Table 2). The

An ongoing expanded access study of erlotinib
conducted by Roche will enroll many more patients
than the current study (approximately 5000 patients
from outside the U.S. have been enrolled to date).
That study, for which the authors are currently collecting tissue samples, will provide additional molecular data.

median duration of survival for those who had never
smoked was not reached. The duration of survival
was found to be similar between current and former
smokers. These results are consistent with the findings from the controlled BR.21 study. Because of
small patient numbers, we could not analyze subgroups defined by race and EGFR mutation status.
Exploratory analyses demonstrated a trend toward a longer median survival and a higher response
rate in females, patients age 65 years, patients with
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, and
patients who smoked <20 pack-years. A similar trend
for age groups and sex was observed on a smaller
magnitude in the BR.21 study. Also consistent with
the BR.21 study, the OS was found to be similar
between patients with adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. However, because of the small
sample sizes, these analyses are descriptive in nature,
and some of the 95% CIs are wide.
The results of the current study also demonstrated that erlotinib was well tolerated in this
patient population. No new safety signals were noted
in this trial. The incidence of erlotinib-related SAEs
was low: 3.1% to 0.4% for fatal SAEs and 2.6% for
nonfatal SAEs. The incidence of interstitial lung disease-like events (n 5 1 patient; 0.4%) was consistent
with that reported in other studies. The incidence of
rash (3.1%) and diarrhea (2.2%) leading to drug discontinuation were also similar to those observed in
other trials. Although the percentage of patients who
discontinued erlotinib treatment because of SAEs or
AEs was relatively high (18.8%), only approximately
one-third of these events (6.6%) were determined to
be related to erlotinib treatment.
