ABSTRACT
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is overactivated and heat shock protein (HSP) 90 is
overexpressed in common cancers. We hypothesized that targeting both pathways can
kill intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. HSP90 and PTEN protein expression
was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining of samples from 78 patients with
intrahepatic CCA. CCA cell lines and a thioacetamide (TAA)-induced CCA animal model
were treated with NVP-AUY922 (an HSP90 inhibitor) and NVP-BEZ235 (a PI3K/mTOR
inhibitor) alone or in combination.
Both HSP90 overexpression and loss of PTEN were poor prognostic factors in
patients with intrahepatic CCA. The combination of the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922
and the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor NVP-BEZ235 was synergistic in inducing cell death in
CCA cells. A combination of NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 caused tumor regression
in CCA rat animal model. This combination not only inhibited the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway but also induced ROS, which may exacerbate the vicious cycle of ER stress.
Our data suggest simultaneous targeting of the PI3K/mTOR and HSP pathways for
CCA treatment.

INTRODUCTION

The ABC-02 trial showed improved overall survival
of CCA patients treated with gemcitabine plus cisplatin
compared to those treated with gemcitabine alone
(11.7  versus 8 months), and defined gemcitabine plus
platinum as a standard treatment for advanced biliary tract
cancer [5]. Several molecular-targeted therapies have been
assessed in clinical trials, with median progression-free

Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a
relatively rare, but increasing more common, hepatobiliary
cancer [1–3]. CCA, the second most common liver cancer,
is an aggressive cancer typically diagnosed at an advanced
stage with poor prognosis [4].

survivals of 1.8–7 months [6, 7]. However, there is no
standard therapy for refractory CCA, and additional
therapeutic drugs are needed urgently.
The molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90
(HSP90) plays an important role in post-translational
maturation and activation of many oncogenic client
proteins that increase the survival, growth, and invasive
potential of cancer cells [8, 9]. HSP90 inhibitors
induce ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation of
numerous oncoproteins, which consequently inhibit
cancer cell growth and survival [10]. We had previously
demonstrated that the HSP90 inhibitor NVP-AUY922
exerted antitumor effects in CCA cells in pathways
involving the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase catalytic
subunit α (PI3K)/v-Akt murine thymoma viral oncogene
homolog 1 protein kinase (Akt)/mammalian target of
rapamycin (mTOR) and the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma
viral oncogene (KRAS)/mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) pathways [11]. Although HSP90 inhibitors
are considered a novel therapeutic strategy for several
cancers pre-clinically [11–15], HSP90 inhibitor monotherapy has shown only limited clinical success [16, 17]
due to suboptimal inhibition of target client proteins [18].
Combination approaches may be required for effective
clinical use of HSP90 inhibitors [19,20].
The PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling cascade is central
to cell survival, apoptosis, metabolism, motility, and
angiogenesis [21]. This pathway is up-regulated in CCA
[22] and is a key pathway for CCA drug development
[6, 7]. PIK3CA (phosphoinositide 3-kinase, catalytic,
α-polypeptide) activating mutations are rarely found in
CCA [22], suggesting that additional mechanisms are
involvement. Recently, an imidazo [4, 5-c] quinoline
derivative dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235 was
shown to inhibit CCA cell growth [23]. However, similar
to HSP90 inhibitor mono-therapy, PI3K inhibitor monotherapy has not produced significant clinical responses
[21, 24].
NVP-BEZ235 targets PI3K and mTOR equally
in cancer [25], and we postulated that the combination
of a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and an HSP90 inhibitor
might cooperatively inhibit tumor cell proliferation and
induce apoptosis. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor also
induces endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, which leads
to mitochondrial damage and subsequent apoptosis [26].
This process may be fueled by oxidative stress when
combined with an mTOR inhibitor [27]. Therefore, the
combination of an HSP90 inhibitor and a PI3K/mTOR
dual inhibitor may promote irreversible ER stress and
induce cell death.
Here, we investigated the effects of targeting the
PI3K/mTOR pathway (with NVP-BEZ235) and HSP90
(with NVP-AUY922) in CCA, both in vitro and in vivo.

HSP90 and PTEN expression in human CCA
HSP90 and PTEN were diffusely expressed in
the cytoplasm in human MF-CCA (Fig 1A, 1B). Two
representative examples showing HSP90 and PTEN
immunohistochemical staining in human CCA were
graded from 0 to 3+, with 0 and 1+ indicating low
expression and 2+ and 3+ indicating high expression
(Figure 1A to 1B).

Clinicopathological features and HSP90 and
PTEN expression levels in patients with MF-CCA
Of the 78 specimens obtained from MF-CCA
patients, 55 (70.5%) showed high HSP90 expression
(2+ and 3+ positive), while 39 (50%) showed low PTEN
expression. Clinicopathological features were similar
between patients with low and high HSP90 and PTEN
expression (Table 1 and 2).

Survival and prognostic analysis of MF-CCA
patients who underwent a hepatectomy
Seventy-eight MF-CCA patients who had undergone
hepatectomy were enrolled in the survival analysis study.
The follow-up duration ranged from 1.4 to 94.1 (median,
13.6) months. Overall survival (OS) rates at 1, 3, and
5 years were 55.1%, 22.9%, and 14.9%, respectively (data
not shown). Univariate log-rank analysis identified the
following factors as negatively affecting OS: the presence
of symptoms, high preoperative alkaline phosphatase and
carcinoembryonic antigen levels, low albumin levels,
tumor size >5 cm, positive surgical margin status, and high
HSP90 and low PTEN expression (Table 3). Multivariate
Cox proportional hazard analysis revealed that poor
nutritional status, positive margin status, and high HSP90
and low PTEN expression independently predicted
unfavorable OS in MF-CCA patients after hepatectomy
(Figure 1C and Table 4).

The combination of NVP-AUY922 and
NVP-BEZ235 blocked proliferation and
induced cytotoxicity of CCA cell lines
The effects of NVP-AUY922 or NVP-BEZ235
mono-therapy and the combination on the growth
of CCA cell lines were determined. NVP-AUY922
and NVP-BEZ235 exhibited strong antiproliferative
effects in both HuCCT1 and CGCCA cells. In
HuCCT1 and CGCCA cells, the IC50 values of NVPAUY922 were 15 and 85 nM, respectively, and those

NVP-AUY922 induced ER stress and disrupted
mitochondrial homeostasis

of NVP-BEZ235 were 97  and 99 nM, respectively
(Figure 2A). NVP-AUY922 (at 7.5, 15, 30, 60, and
120 nmol/L) at NVP-BEZ235 (at 7.5, 15, 30, 60, and
120 nmol/L) both alone and in combination induced
dose-dependent cytotoxicity in the CGCCCA cells
(Figure 2B). The combination of NVP-AUY922 and
NVP-BEZ235 induced synergistic cytotoxicity. Similar
results were seen in the HuCCT1 cell line (Figure 2B).
Although NVP-BEZ235 itself did not trigger cell death
in either cell line, both PI-staining and PARP cleavage
analysis (Figure 2C) revealed that it synergistically
activated apoptotic activity with NVP-AUY922.

We analyzed whether the HSP90 inhibitor
NVP-AUY922 triggered ER stress in CCA cells.
Indeed, NVP-AUY922 upregulated the expression of
several chaperones such as Grp94, Grp78, IRE1α and
phosphorylation of eIF2α (Figure 4A). These signaling
signatures represent the unfolded protein response (UPR)
[28] and indicate that CCA cells were struggling to survive
under NVP-AUY922 treatment. However, CHOP and
JNK activation indicated a shift to the ER stress-induced
apoptosis response in CCA cells following NVP-AUY922
treatment (Figure 4A, ref 29–31). These data are consistent
with the observation that NVP-AUY922 alone triggered a
collapse in mitochondrial membrane potential (Figure 4B)
and induced CCA cell apoptosis (Figure 2C).

NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 work together
to block the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway
To analyze the combinatorial effect of a PI3K/
mTOR dual inhibitor and an HSP90 inhibitor, western
blotting was performed to analyze the activation status
of a series of proteins in the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway.
NVP-BEZ235 efficiently inhibited both PI3K and mTOR
activity within 2 h as indicated by the phosphorylation
status of Akt, 4E-BP1, and S6K, respectively. However,
this was abrogated in the 8–24-h time period (Figure 3B).
On the other hand, NVP-AUY922 inhibited this pathway
more slowly (Figure 3A). Interestingly, the kinetics of
PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway inhibition by the
combination treatment was similar to that of NVP-BEZ235
alone. Moreover, the combination markedly hindered
abrogation of the effect of NVP-BEZ235 mono-therapy
(Figure 3C). These results showed that NVP-BEZ235
and NVP-AUY922 work together to block the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR signaling pathway.

NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 promoted
exces-sive oxidative stress by inducing ROS
and simultaneously suppressing the G6PD/
glutathione antioxidant pathway
NVP-AUY922 induced UPR and ER stress, which
led to mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis. This
process might be exacerbated by oxidative stress when
combined with an mTOR inhibitor [27]. Oxidative stress
is caused by an imbalance between ROS production
and ROS clearance. We investigated whether NVPBEZ235 might enhance the effects of NVP-AUY922 by
suppressing endogenous antioxidant levels. Interestingly,
Both NVP-BEZ235 and NVP-AUY922 alone or combined
decreased the reduced form of glutathione (GSH), one

of the most important endogenous antioxidants, in CCA
cells (Figure 4C and supplemental Figure 1A). We also
analyzed whether simultaneously inhibiting HSP90
and the PI3K/AKT pathway could induce strong ROS
production. Our result demonstrated that the combination
of NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 triggered strong ROS
production in CCA cells (Figure 4D and supplemental
Figure 1B).

HSP90 is a ubiquitously expressed chaperone that is
involved in the post-translational folding and activation of
numerous client proteins implicated in oncogenesis [32].
The prognostic value of HSP90 expression in several types
of cancer has been discussed, but to our knowledge, there
is the first report of the clinical significance of HSP90
expression in CCA prognosis. Lower HSP90 protein
expression was associated with longer overall survival
(Table 3 and Figure 1). Congruently, HSP90 expression
was significantly associated with tumor aggressiveness
and poor prognosis in gastric and breast cancer [33, 34],
which indicates HSP90 is a good drug target in CCA
[11, 35].
Moreover, the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is
upregulated in CCA cells [22] and is one of the most
important targets for CAA drug development [6, 7].
Activating mutations in PIK3CA are only found in
9% of intrahepatic CCA cases [22, 36], suggesting that
additional mechanisms may positively regulate this
pathway. For instance, PTEN, a well-characterized human
tumor suppressor gene, is an antagonist of the PI3K/Akt/
mTOR pathway. Loss of PTEN and activation of SMAD4
or KRAS activation may induce CCA development in
murine models [37, 38], however, clinical implications of
decreased PTEN protein expression in intrahepatic CCA
has not yet been investigated. In this study, univariate
analyses indicated that loss of PTEN expression correlated
with a worse survival in patients with intrahepatic CCA
(Table 3 and Figure 1). This result also supports our
published data; PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical
role in CCA [11]. Moreover, patients with high HSP90
protein expression and PTEN loss had the worst survival
according to multivariate analyses (Table 4), which
suggested that combining a PI3K inhibitor with an HSP90
inhibitor may represent an effective treatment for CCA.
The primary function of HSP90 in cancer was
thought to be stabilization of client oncoproteins,
suggesting that this protein might be a good drug target.
However, recent HSP90 inhibitor clinical trials have
shown that use of HSP90-targeted drugs might not be an
optimally effective therapeutic strategy [9]. Combining
HSP90 inhibitors with other targeted therapies may block
the compensatory signaling mechanisms and impart a
clinical benefit [39]. One strategy is vertically targeting
the same pathway [40]. For example, the survival of
patients with melanoma and the BRAF V600 mutation
improved when treated with a combined BRAF and
MEK inhibitor [41]. In our previous study, we identified
Akt as a client protein of HSP90 [11]. NVP-BEZ235 is
a novel dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor and, when combined
with NVP-AUY922, may vertically target the pathway
at multiple nodes (Figure 4E). Indeed, we observed that
combining NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 enhanced
and prolonged the inhibition of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR
pathway (Figure 3C).

Evaluation of the antitumor effect of NVPAUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 on CCA in vivo
After inducing CCA with TAA, tumors in the control
and treated groups were evaluated by transverse, sagittal,
and coronal PET-computed tomography (CT) images. As
shown in Figure 5A, each group had at least one FDGavid tumor in the liver after 20 weeks of TAA treatment,
as demonstrated by animal the PET-CT coronal images. In
the experimental groups, rats were given BEZ235 alone
(Group 2), AUY922 alone (Group 3), BEZ235/AUY922
(Group 4), or gemcitabine/oxaliplatin (Group 5). The
change in the tumor-to-liver (T/L) ratio, as indicated by
the SUV for each group, is shown in Figure 5B. The T/L
ratio of SUV in the control group (Group 1) elevated
steadily until the last scan (a 14.5% to 21.7% increase,
from the second to the fifth week after the experiments;
Figure 5B). The T/L ratio of SUV in each treatment group
tended to decrease until the last scan; the T/L ratio of SUV
decreased 2 weeks after the experiment, ranging from 3%
to 15%. Gemcitabine with oxaliplatin induced a significant
decrease in the T/L ratio of SUV after 2 weeks compared
with the control group (control, 14.7% versus group 5,
-15.5%, p < 0.05; Figure 5B). However, after 5 weeks of
treatment, NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 induced a
significant decrease in the T/L ratio of SUV compared to
the control group (control, 21.7% versus group 4, -18.3%;
p < 0.05; Figure 5B).

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that both high HSP90
expression and loss of PTEN expression were independent
prognostic factors in CCA. This implies that HSP90 and
the PTEN-related PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway are potential
therapeutic targets in CCA. We then investigated the effect
of a combination of an HSP90 inhibitor (NVP-AUY922)
and a PI3K/mTOR dual inhibitor (NVP-BEZ235) on
CCA. We found that they exerted significant synergistic
proapoptotic and antiproliferative effects in CCA cell lines
in vitro. This combination worked in concert to inhibit the
PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway and induce ROS accumulation;
these effects may exaggerate the vicious cycle of ER
stress. We also demonstrated the synergistic effect of the
NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 in a TAA-induced CCA
animal model.

Figure 5: Detection of rat CCA by animal PET and changes in the tumor/liver SUV ratio (A) Coronal views of fused CT

than baseline at 2–5 wk after the experiment (i.e., wk 20, 22, and 25). (B) Change in the tumor-to-liver (T/L) ratio of SUV in the control

A broad spectrum of insults, including nutrient
deprivation, can trigger ER stress, leading to activation
of adaptive pathways to alleviate the insults, restore
ER homeostasis, and ensure survival. However, under
extensive stress, this same system will trigger a proapoptotic pathway [29, 42]. Most cancer cells have
chronically elevated baseline ER stress levels, as
indicated by increased expression of GRP78 [43]. When
treated with drugs that specifically trigger ER stress, the
key pro-apoptotic ER stress protein, CHOP, can induce
cancer cell apoptosis [44]. HSP90 is critical for several
cellular functions, including protein folding and assembly.
Thus, an HSP90 inhibitor may increase unfolded protein
accumulation (UPR), increase ER stress, and cause
apoptosis [26]. In our study, we found that NVP-AUY922
induced ER stress and activated the UPR, as demonstrated
by the upregulation of GRP78, peIF2a, GRP94, IRE1α
and CHOP, within 4 h (Figure 4A) in CCA cells. The ER
stress induced apoptosis was via both the JNK and caspase
4 pathways (Figure 4A and supplemental Figure 2).
ER stress can lead to ROS production, which occurs
subsequent to the accumulation of unfolded proteins in
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

the ER. Mitochondrial ROS is also generated in after ER
stress induced by Ca2+ release and depolarization of the
inner mitochondrial membrane (ΔΨm) [26, 45]. Oxidative
stress, along with unresolved ER stress, contributes to
cell death. Furthermore, the HSP90 inhibitor IPI-504 and
the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin exert synergic antitumor
effects in Ras-driven tumors by promoting ER stress and
mitochondrial damage, via IPI-504 mediated ROS increase
and a rapamycin-dependent suppression of GSH [27].
We here observed that NVP-AUY922 induced ER stress
and decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential
(ΔΨm) (Figure 4A and 4B). Both NVP-AUY922 and
NVP-BEZ235 inhibited GSH synthesis (Figure 4C  and
supplemental Figure 1A). Finally, both NVP-AUY922
and NVP-BEZ235 induced ROS production (Figure 4D
and supplemental Figure 1B) and promoted cell death.
To investigate the effectiveness of NVP-AUY922,
NVP-BEZ235, their combination and gemcitabine and
oxaliplatin for CCA treatment, we used the previously
established TAA-induced rat CCA model [46]. This model
recapitulates the histological progression of human CCA
[46], indicating that it is a good platform to investigate new
2383

CCA treatment regimens. PET was then used to measure
the tumor response to treatment [47]. Because we could not
detect lesions <2 mm by PET and the invasive CCA border
was indistinguishable from the normal liver background,
the T/L ratio of the SUV was used to represent tumor
growth [47]. The T/L ratio of the SUV was significantly
lower in rats treated with NVP-AUY922 and NVPBEZ235 than in control rats by 5 weeks after treatment
(Figure 5B), suggesting that tumor growth was suppressed
in rats treated with NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235.
In conclusion, both HSP90 protein overexpression and
lower PTEN expression were poor prognostic factors, which
implied that HSP90 inhibitors and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors
are potential therapeutic agents in CCA. NVP-AUY922
and NVP-BEZ235 had potent synergic antitumor activity
(in the low nanomolar range) against CCA cells. Marked
tumor regression was demonstrated in the TAA-induced
CCA rat animal model upon treatment with a combination
of NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235. These preclinical
findings provide a rationale to conduct clinical trials with
NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 in CCA patients.

the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (No. 99-2886B). All
patients gave informed consent prior to inclusion in the
immunostaining study.

Immunohistochemical staining of HSP90 and
PTEN in 78 MF-CCA
Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides
from each case were reviewed. Specimens from MFCCA patients who had undergone hepatectomy were
fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. A 4-μm
section was stained for HSP90 and PTEN. Primary
antibodies against HSP90 (#3098-100, 1:200 dilution;
BioVision, Mountain View, CA) and PTEN (#ab31392,
1:100 dilution; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) were added
to the slides, and the slides were incubated overnight
at 4°C. The slides were then washed in TBST 3 times
for 5 min each before visualization with the DAKO
LSAB2 System, Peroxidase (no K0675; DAKO A/S,
Glostrup, Denmark). Control slides were incubated with
the secondary antibody only. After washing in TBST
3 times for 5 min each, the slides were mounted. The
slides were analyzed blindly under microscopy, and the
expression in the cholangiolar epithelium was classified
as low or high according to the following: negative (<1%
cytoplasmic staining), 1+ (1%–20% cytoplasmic staining),
2+ (21%–50% cytoplasmic staining), or 3+ (>50%
membranous staining). Negative and 1+ immunostaining
were arbitrarily classified as low expression, while all
others were classified as high expression.

METHODS
Clinicopathological features of 78 patients with
mass-forming CCA (MF-CCA)
From the archives of the Chang Gung Memorial
Hospital, 78 patients with MF-CCA who had undergone
hepatectomy between 1989 and 2006 were selected based
on the availability of sufficient quantities of tumor cells.
Intrahepatic CCA was defined as a carcinoma that had
arisen from the second-order or more distal branches
of the intrahepatic ducts. CCAs were further classified
into 3 types based on the macroscopic appearance of
the tumors: MF-CCA, periductal-infiltrating CCA,
and intraductal papillary CCA. Curative resection was
defined as a negative resection margin observed during
histopathological examination. Surgical mortality was
defined as death within a month of surgery. Laboratory
tests were conducted the day before the surgery.
Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were measured by
radioimmunoassay. Tumors were preoperatively evaluated
by abdominal ultrasonography (US), endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography, percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic
resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), or hepatic
arteriography, as appropriate. Tumor stage was defined
according to the pathological tumor node metastasis
(pTNM) classification proposed by the American Joint
Committee on Cancer (AJCC), 6th edition. Following either
a positive section margin or local recurrence, adjuvant
chemotherapy was systemically administered with a
5-flurouracil (5-FU)-based regimen. This clinical study
was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Follow-up study
The follow-up evaluation included a physical
examination and blood chemistry tests at each visit.
In addition, serum levels of CEA and CA 19-9 were
measured, and the remnant liver was examined by
US every 3 months. When a new lesion was detected
by US or elevated levels of CEA/CA 19-9 were noted,
abdominal CT or MRCP was performed for confirmation.
Moreover, when patients complained of bone pain,
bone scans were performed to detect metastasis. If any
of the abovementioned procedures indicated recurrence,
the patient was re-admitted for a more comprehensive
assessment, including angiographic evaluation or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment for recurrence
included surgery, systemic chemotherapy, external beam
radiotherapy, intraluminal radiotherapy, interventional
radiological therapy, and conservative treatment.

Cell lines
Two intrahepatic CCA cell lines, HuCCT1 and
CGCCA, were obtained from the Japanese Collection of
Research Bioresources (Osaka, Japan) and Chang Gung
Memorial Hospital, respectively [46, 48]. HuCCT1 and
2384

Oncotarget

CGCCA cells were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 and
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Gibco, Grand
Island, NY), respectively, supplemented with 10% heatinactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/mL streptomycin,
and 100 μg/mL penicillin, in a humidified atmosphere
containing 5% CO2 at 37°C.

CI values were generated for the 2 drugs. CI < 1, CI = 1,
and CI > 1 indicated synergism, an additive effect, or
antagonism, respectively.

Measurement of reactive oxidative species (ROS)
ROS generation was quantified using an oxidantsensitive fluorescent probe (CM-H2DCFDA; Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA) as a substrate for measuring intracellular
oxidant production [50]. Cells were seeded into 6-well
plates (1 × 105 cells/well), incubated for 24 h, and
then treated with NVP-AUY922 or NVP-BEZ235
for 18 or 24h. Next, these cells were incubated with
CM-H2DCFDA (20 µM final concentration) for 30 min
at 37°C, harvested, and washed twice with PBS; then,
fluorescence was quantified by flow cytometry using a
FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ).
ROS production was expressed as the mean fluorescence
intensity. Experiments were performed in triplicate, and
data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Reagents
NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 were provided by
Novartis (Basel, Switzerland). Gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
were purchased from TTY Biopharm (Taipei, Taiwan).
For the in vitro experiments, 10 mM stock solutions of
NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 were prepared in 100%
DMSO and stored at -20°C (NVP-AUY922) and 4°C
(NVP-BEZ235). For administration, optimized NVPAUY922 and NVP-BEZ235 salts with high solubility in
aqueous solution were formulated in D5W. NVP-AUY922
was delivered by intraperitoneal (ip) injection in a volume
of 6.25 mg/kg. NVP-BEZ235 was delivered orally (po)
in a volume of 15 mg/kg. Gemcitabine (50 mg/kg) and
oxaliplatin (2 mg/kg) were delivered by ip injection.

Assay to detect apoptotic cell death
Apoptosis was measured using the TACS Annexin
V-FITC apoptosis detection kit (Trevigen) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 24-h incubation,
cells were treated with DMSO, NVP-AUY922, or NVPBEZ235 for 48 h. Cells were collected and stained with
Annexin V and propidium iodide (PI), and then analyzed
using a FACSCalibur. The data were analyzed using
CellQuest software (BD). Experiments were performed
in triplicate, and data are expressed as mean ± standard
deviation.

Cell viability assay
The viability of the cells was determined using the
sulforhodamine B (SRB) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA)
assay, it’s based on measuring cellular protein content of
live cells. The CGCCA and HuCCT1 cells were seeded
with 2 x 103/well in 100 μl of culture medium into 96-well
microplates, and allowed to adhere for 24 h. Next day,
the cells were treated with various concentration of
NVP-AUY922, NVP-BEZ235 or in combination for 72 h.
After the incubation period, the medium were removed,
and the cells were fixed with 10% (W/V) trichloroacetic
acid (TCA) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 30 min
at 4°C. Then, cleared up TCA and washed the plates
with water four times, allowed them to air-dry at room
temperature. Next step, stained with SRB dissolved in
1.0% acetic acid for 30 min, after which, rinsed the plates
repeatedly with 1.0% acetic acid to remove excess dye and
air-dry. The protein-bound dye was dissolved in 10 mM
Tris base solution, and determine optical density (OD) at
540 nm using a VersaMax microplate reader (Molecular
Devices, Sunnyvale, USA).

Measurement of mitochondrial membrane
potential (ΔΨm)
Variation in ΔΨm was investigated using
5,5ʹ,6,6ʹ-tetrachloro-1,1ʹ,3,3ʹ- tetraethyl-benzimidazolcarbocyanine iodide (JC-1; BD Biosciences, San Diego,
CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions [51].
Cells were seeded into 6-well plates at a density of
1 × 105 cells/well, incubated overnight, and then treated
with DMSO or 0.5 uM NVP-AUY922 or NVP-BEZ235
or both. After treatment, the cells were collected and
incubated with JC-1 for 15 min at 37°C. After washing
twice with PBS, the cells were suspended in a total volume
of 400 mL and analyzed using a FACSCalibur.

Combination index (CI) determination
The CI values of NVP-AUY922 and NVP-BEZ235
were evaluated using a Biosoft CalcuSyn software
program (Ferguson, MO) based on the method reported
by Chou and Talalay [49]. Cells were treated with various
concentrations of drugs either alone or in combination for
72 h. Data from cell viability assays were expressed as
the fraction of antiproliferative activity (cell viability loss)
induced by an individual drug, alone or in combination, and

Measurement of glutathione content
Intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) content was
determined using the GSH-Glo™ Glutathione Assay kit
(Promega, Madison, WI) [52]. The kit is a luminescencebased assay for the detection and quantification of GSH.
Briefly, cells were seeded into 96-well white plates

treated with 0.5 uM NVP-AUY922 or NVP-BEZ235 or
both for 24 or 48 h, and then processed according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. The luminescence values
were measured using the Infinite M1000 microplate reader
(TECAN, Australia).

4-week period (specifically, the 21st week to the 24th
week of the experimental period). The gemcitabine/
oxaliplatin group received gemcitabine (50 mg/kg, ip)
and oxaliplatin (2 mg/kg, ip) once every 2 weeks over
a 4-week period. The control group rats received ip
injections of buffer, according to the same schedule.

Western blotting

To evaluate changes in glycolysis in live rats
with liver tumors, we conducted 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]
fluoro-d-glucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography
(PET) studies at the molecular imaging center of Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital. Thirty rats were treated with
thioacetamide and subjected to serial PET scanning
on weeks 20, 22, and 25 using the Inveon™ system
(Siemens Medical Solutions USA Inc., Knoxville,
TN). Equal numbers of animals were assigned to the
control and treatment groups according to baseline
PET findings. In other words, the control and treatment
groups possessed similar PET-positive rates. The details
regarding radioligand preparation, scanning protocols,
and optimal scanning time determination have been
described previously by our group [47]. Briefly,
animals were fasted overnight prior to the scan. At
90 min post-18F-FDG injection (intravenous), 3
­ 0-min
static scans were obtained for all the animals. All
imaging studies were performed using a temperature(37°C) and anesthesia gas- (2% isoflurane in 100%
oxygen) controlled imaging bed (Minerve System). PET
images were reconstructed using the 2D ordered subset
expectation-maximization method (4 iterations and 16
subsets) without attenuation and scatter corrections.
All imaging data were processed using the PMOD
image analysis workstation (PMOD Technologies
Ltd., Zurich, Switzerland). The largest liver tumor was
identified by careful investigation of 3 image sets for
each rat. 18F-FDG uptake into the largest liver tumor
and apparently normal liver tissue was quantified
by calculating the standardized uptake value (SUV)
according to the following formula:

Positron emission tomography

Whole cell lysates of CCA cell lines were obtained
using Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Scientific, Rockford,
IL). Protein samples were separated on 8%–12%
gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gels
(SDS-PAGE) and transferred to Immobilon-P (Millipore,
Bedford, MA) membranes. Antigen-antibody complexes
were detected using the ECL blotting analysis system
(Millipore). Primary antibodies against the following
targets were used: AKT (9272; Cell Signaling, Danvers,
MA), p-AKT (9271; Cell Signaling), cleaved poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase (c-PARP, 9541S; Cell
Signaling), p-4E-BP1 (9459; Cell Signaling), p-p70S6K

Animal studies
All animal studies were approved by the
experimental animal ethics committee of the Chang
Gung Memorial Hospital, and were conducted in
accordance with the US National Institute of Health
(NIH) guidelines for the care and use of laboratory
animals (Publication no. 85-23, revised 1996). Thirty
adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats (310 ± 14 g) were
equally divided into 5 groups: the control (Group 1),
BEZ235 (Group  2), AUY922 (Group 3), BEZ235/
AUY922 (Group 4), and gemcitabine/oxaliplatin
groups (Group 5). The rats were housed in an animal
room under a 12-h light-dark cycle (light from 08:00
AM to 08:00 PM) at an ambient temperature of 22°C.
Food and water were provided ad libitum. The rats
were administered 300 mg thioacetamide (TAA)/L in
drinking water daily for up to 25 weeks. Mice in the
BEZ235, AUY922, and BEZ235/AUY922 groups were
administered NVP-BEZ235 (15 mg/kg, po), NVPAUY922 (6.25 mg/kg, ip), or a combination of these
2 agents, respectively, once daily 5 d per week over a

These values were calculated according to the
recommendations of the European Organization for
Research and Treatment of Cancer [43]. The tumor regions
of interest (ROIs) were determined using transverse
images of the selected tumors and measuring the largest
diameter. Normal liver ROIs were also determined using
the same transverse images. The mean SUV (SUVmean)
of the normal liver and tumor tissue was determined, and
the tumor-to-liver radioactivity ratio was calculated for
comparison.

All data are presented as mean ± standard deviation
(SD). Differences between experimental animals and
controls were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U
test or the Kruskal-Wallis test. Overall survival was
calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Eighteen
clinicopathological variables were selected for difference
analysis using the log-rank test (univariate). The Cox
proportional hazards model was employed for multivariate
regression analysis. SPSS statistical software for Windows
was used for statistical analysis (SPSS version 13.0;
Chicago, IL). P values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
