Abstract
Strategies to prevent organ transplant rejection whilst minimizing long-term
immunosuppression are currently under intense investigation with regulatory T cells
(Tregs) nearing clinical application. The clinical trial, ThRIL, recently commenced
at King’s College London, proposes to use Treg cell therapy to induce tolerance in
liver transplant recipients, the success of which has the potential to revolutionize
the management of these patients and enable a future of drug-free transplants. This
is the first report of the manufacture of clinical grade Tregs from prospective liver
transplant recipients via a CliniMACS-based GMP isolation technique and expanded
using anti-CD3/CD28 beads, IL-2 and rapamycin. We report the enrichment of a pure,
stable population of Tregs (>95% CD4+CD25+FOXP3+), reaching adequate numbers
for their clinical application. Our protocol proved successful in, influencing the
expansion of superior functional Tregs, as compared to freshly isolated cells, whilst
also preventing their conversion to Th17 cells under pro-inflammatory conditions. We
conclude with the manufacture of the final Treg product in the clinical research facility
(CRF), a prerequisite for the clinical application of these cells. The data presented in
this manuscript together with the much-anticipated clinical results from ThRIL, will
undoubtedly inform the improved management of the liver transplant recipient.

Introduction

The current approach to immunosuppression in
transplantation is far from ideal with an enormous interest
in the minimization/complete withdrawal of these drugs
in liver transplant recipients. There have also been reports
of a variable proportion of liver transplant recipients
developing a state of ‘operational’ tolerance thus forgoing
the requirements of therapeutic immunosuppression
[1]. This phenomenon, however, only occurs late after
transplantation and in a minority of patients [2]. It is,
therefore, necessary to find novel strategies to allow for
the development of tolerance early after transplantation
and in turn negate the use of lifelong immunosuppression.
In this setting regulatory T cells (Tregs) are
attractive candidates for therapeutic strategies aimed at

Liver transplantation remains the treatment
of choice for patients with end stage liver disease.
Therapeutic advances in immunosuppression have led to
a dramatic improvement in allotransplantation, averting
acute rejection and supporting short-term graft survival.
However, the obligatory protracted use of powerful nonspecific immunosuppressants is complicated by increased
morbidity and mortality as a result of chronic rejection and
associated toxicity. The constant proportion of transplanted
organs lost each year necessitating re-transplantation, in a
climate of donor organ shortage, places further strain on
an already saturated transplant waiting list.

tolerance induction, bearing in mind their integral role in
promoting immune homeostasis. Characterised by the high
and stable expression of surface interleukin-2 receptor
α chain (IL-2Rα, CD25hi) and the transcription factor,
FOXP3, these cells only constitute approximately 1-3%
of circulating CD4+ T cells in the periphery [3-5]. As such,
recent advances permitting the expansion of these cells
ex vivo presents an attractive opportunity in modulating
immune responses through their adoptive transfer. We
have shown that infusion of recipient murine Tregs,
expanded in vitro, can prolong skin allograft survival and
induce indefinite acceptance of heart allografts [6]. More
recently, the adoptive transfer of polyclonal human Tregs
in humanised mice protected from human skin pathology
and induced increased survival of transplanted islets [7-9].
The posited implications of Treg cell therapy in the
context of liver transplantation have been aptly construed
in murine models whereby liver allografts from tolerant
mice were infiltrated with Tregs, and the depletion of
these cells resulted in a loss of tolerance [10]. This
circumstance is further mirrored in human subjects with
increased frequencies of Tregs reported in operationally
tolerant liver transplant recipients [11] paralleled by low
circulating levels during acute rejection [12]. As such,
there is little doubt that Tregs are promising candidates
for tolerance induction in liver transplantation.
To date no clinical trials addressing the safety and
efficacy of Treg cell therapy in the induction of tolerance
in solid organ transplantation have been described. Recent
trials have primarily focused on the safety profile of Treg
therapy in the setting of bone marrow transplantation [1315] and type I diabetes [16], with encouraging reports
of efficacy. As a result, the prospects of applying Treg
adoptive cell therapy in organ transplantation are now
widely recognised.
In this regard, we have just opened the first combined
Phase I/IIa clinical trial of Treg immunotherapy in the
setting of liver transplantation, ThRIL (NCT02166177).
Here, the safety, tolerability and efficacy of polyclonally
expanded autologous Tregs from patients with end-stage
liver disease, in combination with thymoglobulin and an
mTOR-inhibitor-based immunosuppression regimen, will
be assessed.
This is the first report, employing a Good
Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant protocol for
the ex vivo expansion of Tregs from prospective liver
transplant recipients. We further present the successful
manufacture of the final drug product in the Biomedical
Research Centre Clinical Research Facility (BRC CRF)
at Guy’s Hospital (King’s College London) as a prelude
for ThRIL.

Isolation and expansion of a pure Treg population
from ARC patients
In preparation for ThRIL, clinical grade autologous
Tregs were isolated from 9 patients with alcohol related
cirrhosis (ARC), awaiting transplantation, and 9 age and
sex matched healthy controls (HCs). Using a protocol
previously reported [17], similar numbers of cells were
isolated from ARC patients and HCs (7.14x106 ± 0.938
vs. 7.91x106 ± 0.728, respectively; P = 0.528) (Figure
1A). This result confirms the similar frequency of Tregs
observed ex vivo in the blood of ARC patients and HCs
(4.13 ± 0.932 compared with 4.31 ± 0.889, respectively; P
= 0.888) (Figure 1B).
The feasibility of autologous T cell therapy depends
on success in the expansion of sufficient cell numbers in
vitro. In this regard, Tregs were expanded using anti-CD3/
CD28 monoclonal antibody-coated beads, high dose IL-2
and rapamycin, as previously reported [17, 18].
Assessment of the percentages of cells expressing
CD8+, CD4+ and CD25+ molecules, demonstrated on
average a purity of 77.7% ± 10.3 CD4+CD25+ and 2.50
% ± 1.71 CD8+ cells at the start of the culture (S1).
Expansion in vitro under the conditions described led to
an enrichment of CD4+CD25+ cells; 91.3% ± 2.33, P =
0.004 with only 0.153% ± 0.073; P = 0.008 CD8+ cells
at the end of culture (Figure 2A, 2B). The comparable
purities of cells cultured in the absence of rapamycin were
87.5% ± 4.12; P = 0.088 and 0.292% ± 0.172; P = 0.0019,
respectively.
In line with previous reports [19] the mean
fluorescent intensity (MFI) of CD25 expression was
highest following exposure of Tregs to rapamycin (data
not shown).

Tregs from ARC patients can be expanded to
clinically suitable numbers
We next determined whether patient-derived Tregs
could be expanded in vitro to numbers required for the
maximum dose of Treg injection planned for ThRIL
(4.5x106/Kg).
Tregs from both patients and HCs expanded rapidly
with comparable fold-expansion during the 36 days of
culture (in the presence of rapamycin: ARC 1430 ± 239 vs
HC 1060 ± 139; P = 0.207, in the absence of rapamycin:
ARC 2080 ± 428 vs HC 1670 ± 359; P = 0.469) (Figure
2C). In addition, despite a trend for a reduced fold
expansion there was no statistical difference in foldexpansion of Treg lines in the presence of rapamycin as
compared to untreated cultures for both cohorts (ARC; 0
.199, HC; P = 0.135). Additionally the average expansion

the feasibility of reaching numbers needed for the high
dose of Tregs planned to be administered in ThRIL.

shown that the percentage of CD4+CD25+FOXP3Hi cells
was increased in culture in the presence of rapamycin
(S1: 24.7% ± 2.95 vs. Final harvest: 63.4% ± 4.23; P <
0.0001) as compared to the untreated cultures (Figure 3B).
In agreement, the MFI of FOXP3 was higher following
exposure to rapamycin as compared to untreated cultures
and baseline (Figure 3C).
Additionally, several subsets of Tregs have been
described to date with reports that CD4+CD25hi FOXP3+
Tregs typically lack the expression of the interleukin
(IL)-7 receptor alpha chain, CD127 [22]. The differential
expression of CD127 has been used to denote an optimally
pure population of Tregs that is inversely correlated
with FOXP3 levels and the suppressive function of
human CD4+ Tregs. In support of the increase in purity
of the cultures in the presence of rapamycin, our data
demonstrate an increase in the frequency of CD127lo in
the rapamycin treated cultures as compared the untreated
cultures (P = <0.0001) (Figure 3D).
Constitutive high level of expression of CTLA-4
represents another well-documented trait of Tregs that has
also been shown to contribute to their suppressive function
[23-25]. Analysis of the cultures at final harvest revealed
that rapamycin led to an increase in the percentage of

Rapamycin expanded Tregs maintained high
levels of FOXP3, CD127lo and CTLA4 with a
sustained expression of CD62L and CXCR3
Having established the enrichment of CD4+CD25+
Tregs under these culture conditions, the expression of
the transcription factor, FOXP3, of importance in Treg
development and function was analysed [20]. Initially,
upon isolation the total percentage of CD4+CD25+FOXP3+
cells stood at 77.7% ± 3.35, and contrary to published
data reporting a loss of FOXP3 expression with prolonged
periods of culture [21], the data reported an increase in the
purity of culture in the presence of rapamycin to 90.66%
± 2.19, P =0.0053. (Figure 3A).
In addition, using a more stringent gating strategy
whereby we were able to distinguish two distinct
populations based on FOXP3 expression, termed FOXP3Hi
and FOXP3Int (Supplementary Figure 1) it was also

untreated cells (Final harvest: 14.6 ± 4.15; P = 0.859)

MFI of this marker in rapamycin treated cultures as
compared to baseline (Figure 3G).

homing properties of the injected cells. In the transplant
setting, Treg lymph node homing and their ability to traffic
to the graft are both required for their protection against
graft rejection [26]. In this regard, it was shown that
culture of Tregs in the presence of rapamycin maintained
their expression of the lymphoid homing receptor, CD62L
(S1: 68.1% ± 3.00 vs. Final harvest: 72.0% ± 3.51; P =
0.412), which was not preserved when cells were cultured
in the absence of rapamycin; P < 0.0001 (Figure 3H).
Furthermore, the expression of CXCR3, the
chemokine receptor important for the migration and
recruitment of Tregs to the liver was measured [27] at
baseline and after the 36 days expansion. In the absence of
rapamycin a decrease in the Tregs expressing CXCR3 P =

0.015 was observed. In contrast, the addition of rapamycin
maintained the expression of this marker on the Tregs
(Figure 3H). Further analysis detailing the chemokine
receptor expression of the final product and the cytokine
production of the Tregs is presented in Supplementary
Figures 2 and 3.

Rapamycin stabilizes the Treg population by
preventing IL-17 production

to suppress the proliferation of T effectors (Figure 4).
The data clearly demonstrated that at the end of
expansion, the suppressive function elicited by ARC
Tregs in the presence of rapamycin was significantly
higher as compared to freshly isolated Tregs at different
Treg:Teffector ratios (1:1 ratio - final harvest: 84.8% ±
3.96 vs. S1: 25.4% ± 6.03; P = 0 .0001, 1:10 ratio -final
harvest: 68.3% ± 6.85 vs. S1: 16.2% ± 4.68; P = 0.0001).
In the untreated cultures, despite an increase in Treg
suppressive function at day 12 (S2), this increase did not
reach similar levels to those obtained from Tregs expanded
in the presence of rapamycin (1:1 ratio 60.5% ± 7.26 vs.
88.2% ± 2.76, respectively; P = 0.0026; and 1:10 ratio
42.0% ± 8.99 vs. 79.1% ± 3.90, respectively; P = 0.0016).
Moreover, the increase in Treg suppressive function was
not preserved by final harvest in the untreated cultures
as compared to the rapamycin treated cultures (1:1 ratio
25.2% ± 4.58 vs 84.8% ± 3.96, respectively; P = 0.0001;
1:10 ratio 7.32% ± 2.32 vs 68.3 ± 6.85, respectively; P =
0.0001) (Figure 4). These results further support the use
of the rapamycin based GMP protocol in the expansion
of autologous Tregs from ARC patients in view of the
increased Treg suppressor function.

One of the major concerns in Treg immunotherapy
is the plasticity of Tregs and their conversion to cells
producing inflammatory cytokines, when exposed to a
pro-inflammatory environment [28, 29]. As such, freshly
isolated and expanded Tregs were cultured for 5 days
in the presence of Th17 skewing conditions and the
percentage of IL-17+ cells (Figure 5A) and the production
of IL-17 (Figure 5B) assessed by FACS and ELISA,
respectively, in order to ascertain their stability. Our data
clearly confirmed that over the 36-days culture period
the presence of rapamycin resulted in the production of
a stable population of Tregs with a reduced percentage of
IL-17+ cells as compared to baseline, when exposed to a
proinflammatory milieu (Mix 1: P = 0.0384; Mix 2: P =
0.0446). Additionally, diminished IL-17 production was
detected on analysis of culture supernatants, confirming
the data obtained by intracellular staining (Mix 1: S1
1965pg/ml ± 318 vs. final harvest 124pg/ml ± 34.5; P <
0.0001; Mix 2: S1 1322pg/ml ± 347 vs. rapamycin at final
harvest: 84.3pg/ml ± 35.3; P = 0.0027) (Figure 5A, 5B).
Moreover, assessment of the percentage of IFNγ+ cells
also clearly demonstrated that rapamycin resulted in a
non-inflammatory Treg population with a reduction in the
frequency of FOXP3+IFNγ+ cells by final harvest (Mix 1
S1; 6.42% ± 0.915 vs. final harvest 2.54% ± 0.560; P =
0.0023; Mix 2; S1 4.61% ± 0.698 vs. final harvest 2.82%

± 0.688; P = 0.084) (Figure 5C).
To further assess the susceptibility of Tregs to
differentiate into Th17 cells the expression of CD161
on the Tregs was investigated. Expression of CD161 by
T cells has been reported as a marker for precursors of
IL-17 producing T cells and in addition, characterises a

population of Tregs with the propensity to produce IL-17,
as shown by our group and others [30-33].
Our data showed that during the 36-day expansion
period there was a decrease in the percentage of
CD161+ Tregs (from 19.6% ± 2.42 to 1.48% ± 0.26;
P < 0.0001) (Figure 5D). In parallel a decrease in the

respectively, P < 0.0001) (Figure 5E).

efficacy assessed in Stage II whereby immunosuppression
withdrawal will be attempted in transplant recipients who
have received the highest tolerated dose of Tregs.
To date studies aimed at withdrawing
immunosuppression in liver transplant recipients early
post transplantation have been largely unsuccessful [34]
highlighting the need for an intervention, such as that
proposed in ThRIL, to promote ‘tolerance’.
Here, we outline the first account of the ex vivo
expansion of Tregs from prospective liver transplant
recipients at GMP standards. The data presented describes
the clinical grade isolation strategy and demonstrates the
feasibility of autologous Treg cell-based therapy in liver
transplantation.
We present data on the selection of a pure population
of Tregs (CD4+CD25+ at S1: 77.7% ± 10.3), using a twostep magnetic activated cell sorting (MACS) protocol.
In two of the reported clinical trials [13, 16] a higher
degree of Treg purity was attained using Treg isolation
based on the combined expression of CD4+, CD25+, and
low expression of CD127 molecules [22]. Whilst cell
isolation based on a combination of these markers is
highly effective, the lack of GMP cell sorter facilities in
the UK makes this translationally unfeasible. In addition,
Marek et al. showed that during the expansion process
Tregs were “transforming” into effector/memory like cells
and proposed that regardless of the phenotypic markers
used for Treg isolation, the only variable to maintain
Treg phenotype and function is to limit the duration of
expansion to 2 weeks [35].
In support of this study, others have also shown that
the large-scale manufacture of Tregs remains challenging,
reporting that even when starting with a highly pure
population of Tregs, repeated stimulation results in the loss
of FOXP3 expression [21]. In the clinical trial conducted
by Trzonkowski et al. a decrease in the percentage
FOXP3+ cells after successive weekly stimulation was
reported [13]. However, the disadvantage of limiting
cultures to two rounds of stimulation became evident in
the trial of Treg immunotherapy in Type 1 diabetes where
the authors noted an insufficient Treg yield in four out of
the ten patients [16].
We generated Tregs in concordance with the
proposed GMP protocol, expanding these cells in vitro for
36 days with three rounds of stimulation, in the presence
of rapamycin. This resulted in the expansion of Tregs to
numbers sufficient for administration of the maximum
dose for the ThRIL trial. Despite the three rounds of
stimulation, and contrary to the studies outlined above,
FOXP3 expression was maintained in culture and the data
clearly demonstrated that in the presence of rapamycin
there was an increase in the percentage of FOXP3Hi Tregs
and in the level of expression of FOXP3 at final harvest
(Figure 3B, 3C).
One of the concerns with the clinical translation
of bead-separated Treg preparations is the presence

Tregs from ARC patients were enriched,
expanded and cryopreserved in the Clinical
Research Facility
To extend the Treg protocol from the laboratory
to the GMP facility and validate the process for clinical
use in ThRIL, 150ml of peripheral blood was obtained
from three patients with ARC and Tregs isolated, using
the CliniMACS Plus system and expanded in the BRC
CRF, Guy’s Hospital. Comparison of the recovery of the
isolated cells from ARC patients in the BRC CRF and the
research laboratory revealed an initial lower recovery of
cells, 3.68 ± 1.18 x106 vs. 7.14x106 ± 1.27, respectively
(Figure 1A, Table 1A). Despite this, Tregs from patients
were successfully expanded, reaching numbers well over
the requirements of the ThRIL trial (Table 1A).
After ex vivo expansion, a comprehensive
analysis of the Tregs was performed to ensure the final
product satisfied the specified release criteria, essential
for their clinical application (Supplementary Table
4). At final harvest the mean percentage of cells with
a CD4+CD25+FOXP3+ phenotype was 89.2% ± 2.61
with 0.913% ± 0.591 CD8+ cells, with a mean viability
of 94.9% ± 1.98. Evaluation of the potency of the final
product showed the expansion of Tregs with suppressive
ability >65% (Table 1B).
Of note, however, ThRIL requires the final product
to be injected 3 months post transplantation and therefore
necessitates cryopreservation of these cells. Following
cryopreservation >80% live cells were recovered and the
results demonstrate that Tregs maintained their phenotype
and function (Table 1B).

Discussion
One of the major drawbacks following liver
transplantation is the requirement for lifelong treatment
with immunosuppressants with their accompanying
side effects and complications. This contributes to a
disappointing 60% patient survival rate at 10 years after
transplantation. In this regard, the use of cell-based
therapies, harnessing the natural immunoregulatory
properties of the immune system, is an emerging
therapeutic option and Tregs have been recognized as ideal
candidates in this endeavor.
ThRIL is a pioneering two stage clinical trial
investigating the use of autologous Treg immunotherapy
as an individualised medicine to promote transplantation
tolerance in liver transplantation. Stage I, prioritises the
safety and tolerability of Treg immunotherapy with Treg

of ‘contaminating’ effector T cells. However, as has
been reported previously [18], expansion of Tregs in
the presence of rapamycin led to the enrichment of a
Treg population with increased CD127lo and CTLA4 expression (Figure 3D, 3F), correlating with the
pronounced increase in suppressive function (Figure 4).
CTLA-4 has been recognized as an important regulatory
marker expressed by Tregs and has been reported to play
an important role in their suppressive function, through
the internalization of co-stimulatory molecules on
antigen presenting cells (APC) [23]. This has significant
implications, concerning the clinical application of
autologous patient derived Tregs in the setting of liver
transplantation, whereby our protocol ensures the high
expression of this key regulatory molecule.
Another major potential barrier to Treg therapy is the
possibility that these cells may assume a pro-inflammatory
phenotype. In this study, we provide further evidence to
our published data where we report that conditioning of
Tregs with rapamycin leads to the production of a stable,
non-inflammatory Treg population due to the inhibition
of IL-17 and IFN-γ production by Tregs in vitro in the
presence of intense inflammatory conditions (Figure 5A,
5B) [18, 36].
In line with this, a decrease in the percentage of
cells co-expressing CD161 and CCR6 was demonstrated,
confirming previous work [37]. Moreover, in view of
the plasticity of Tregs, Kopft et al. studied the reciprocal
differentiation of Tregs and Th17 cells and reported that
rapamycin suppresses the differentiation of pathogenic
Th17 cells [38]. As such, patients in the ThRIL study will
be taking rapamycin by the time of Treg infusion. This
adjunctive immunosuppression has the dual advantages of
promoting Treg survival and stability by reducing the risk
of the injected cells acquiring pro-inflammatory features.
Furthermore there have been reports of the
importance of epigenetic control of Foxp3 expression
through the methylation of the Treg specific demethylated
region (TSDR). Future research will be focused at
understanding Treg commitment and epigenetic regulation
of FOXP3 expression so that the mechanisms can be
harnessed to stabilise the Tregs, of importance for their
clinical application.
In addition to stability, therapeutic strategies
using Tregs have to also take into account the need for
appropriate tissue trafficking to enable contact with their
target cells. The expression of the chemokine receptor,
CXCR3, has been reported to mark subsets of T cells
associated their migration to sites of inflammation [39].
Furthermore, in a murine model of T cell mediated liver
injury, Lapierre et al. demonstrated the ability of CXCR3+
Tregs to migrate to the liver, in turn potentiating the
effectiveness of Treg adoptive transfer [40]. The data
presented here demonstrates the preservation of cells
expressing CD62L and CXCR3, important for their
passage to lymph nodes and the liver respectively (Figure
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

Finally, we show that despite a lower recovery of
isolated cells (Tables 1A & 1B), partly explained by the
closed system of isolation procedure which involves a
longer, more vigorous cell isolation procedure, adequate
numbers of Tregs, that meet the trial release criteria,
can be expanded in the BRC CRF at Guy’s Hospital and
remain functional after freeze-thawing, a prerequisite
precluding their clinical translation.
Additionally, it is pertinent to note that initial
confidence in adoptive Treg cell therapy as a self-sufficient
entity, experimental data has shown that the efficacy of
Treg therapy requires the setting of a favorable in vivo
environment, supporting both the cell engraftment and
the chance of inducing tolerance, such as transient host
T cell depletion by immunosuppressive treatments
[41, 42]. This highlights the importance of strategies to
tailor immunosuppressive therapy to ensure the in vivo
survival of the injected Tregs or enhance their longevity
in vivo. In this regard the clinical protocol for ThRIL is
based on a Treg supportive immunosuppressive regimen
including the use anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG), to
induce lymphopenia with a preferential preservation of
Tregs [43]. Additionally to limit memory T cell expansion
post ATG induction, patients are started on tacrolimus and
prednisolone and a month prior Treg infusion maintained
on low dose tacrolimus with the addition of rapamycin,
to promote selective Treg expansion in vivo [44]. The
intention behind this protocol: to create a tolerogenic
milieu thus maximizing the potential efficacy of the
exogenously administered Tregs through prolongation
of their in vivo survival. It is also reassuring that these
cells will be injected in a ‘Treg nurturing’ environment,
centered on the inclusion of rapamycin, as compared
to other immunosuppressants whose indiscriminant
mechanism of action poses a threat to Treg survival.
Thus, tailoring the immunosuppressive regimen
along with the administration of ex vivo expanded Tregs
may potentially maintain post liver transplant tolerance,
accomplishing the ultimate aim of Treg immunotherapy
trials in this setting.
Presently, the first two patient recruited into the
ThRIL trial have received the first Treg injection, with
no reported toxicity to date. The near future will now see
the reporting of this clinical trial along with the much
anticipated immunomontoring data, informing the in vivo
dynamics of the cells expanded. There is no question that
the information gleaned from the ThRIL trial will serve
as to guide the transition of Tregs as a viable therapeutic
option in liver transplant recipients.
Additionally, with the advent of GMP-compliant
FACS sorting there will be developments in the current
GMP protocol for the manufacture of the final cell
product with a focus on the optimal Treg subset with
potent suppressive function, specificity, and those that are
epigenetically stable.

Material and Methods

150ml of peripheral blood was obtained from 12
patients with alcohol related cirrhosis (ARC), awaiting
transplantation. Patient selection was based on the
inclusion criteria in accordance with the ThRIL clinical
protocol (NCT02166177) (Supplementary Table 1 and
Table 2). As outlined by the UK transplant registry
http://www.odt.nhs.uk/uk-transplant-registry/ cirrhosis
secondary to alcohol is one of the leading indications for
liver transplantation in the UK and as such this cohort of
patients form the majority of patients recruited into the
ThRIL trial.
Peripheral blood was obtained from 9 age and sex
matched healthy controls (HCs). All blood samples were
handled and disposed of in concordance with Human
Tissue Act 2008. Human studies were conducted in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved
by the Institutional Review Board (09/H0707/86).

restimulated every 10-12 days. Beads were magnetically
removed and the cells washed in PBS. This process was
repeated to ensure bead removal following which, fresh
beads, rapamycin and IL-2 were added. Expanded cells
were used for further analysis at each time of restimulation
up until day 36 of expansion.
In the BRC CRF, under GMP conditions, enriched
cells were seeded in MACS® GMP Cell Expansion
Bags at 0.5×106 cells/mL in TexMACS™ GMP Medium
(Miltenyi Biotec) supplemented with 5% human AB
serum (Seralab, UK), containing 100 nM rapamycin
(Rapamune®, Pfizer) and activated with anti-CD3/CD28coated beads (4:1 bead:cell ratio, MACS GMP ExpAct
Treg Kit, Miltenyi Biotec). Human recombinant IL-2 (500
IU/mL; Proleukin®, Novartis) was added at day 4-6 and
replenished every 2-3 days. The cells were rested 4 days
before restimulation. Stimulation occurred on days 12 and
24, during which time cells were pooled, fresh beads (1:1),
rapamycin, and IL-2 added. At final harvest, the pooled
cells were processed on the CliniMACS Plus Instrument
using a pre-set depletion program to remove the ExpAct
Treg expansion beads. A sample of the cells was assessed
for safety and functional analysis.

Treg isolation

Flow cytometry

In the laboratory, peripheral blood mononuclear
cells (PBMC) were isolated from patients and HCs by
lymphocyte (PAA, Pasching, Austria) density gradient
centrifugation and depleted for CD8+ cells followed
by enrichment of CD25+ T cells using magnetic beads
(Miltenyi Biotec, Woking, UK) and as previously reported
[17]. All reagents and consumables used were of clinical
GMP grade.
In the BRC CRF, blood volume was reduced, using
the Sepax® 2 device (Biosafe) prior to Treg isolation.
Tregs were purified using a combination of CD8+
reduction (CliniMACS CD8 reagent, Miltenyi Biotec,
Woking, UK) and enrichment steps for CD25+ cells
(CliniMACS CD25 reagent, Miltenyi Biotec), using the
automated CliniMACS® Plus System (Miltenyi Biotec) in
the BRC CRF at Guy’s Hospital. All processing steps were
performed in closed systems, using single use tubing sets.

Flow cytometric analysis was performed on freshly
isolated and expanded Tregs using the BD FACSCanto™
cell analyzer (BD Bioscience, Oxford, UK) and analysed
using FlowJo software (TreeStarInc, OR, USA). In
short, cells were washed and stained with the listed
mAbs in the Supplementary Table 3 for 30 min at 4°C.
Appropriate isotype control antibodies were used for each
sample. Following staining, cells were examined by flow
cytometry.
Intracellular staining for FOXP3 was performed
in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocol
(eBioscience). Expression levels of and IL-17 was
assessed after activation of cells with phorbol myristate
acetate (PMA, 5ng/ml, Sigma Aldrich, St Luis, MO,
USA), Ionomycin (1µg/ml, Sigma Aldrich, St Luis, MO,
USA) and Monensin (2µM, eBioscience, San Diego, CA,
USA) for 4 hours. Subsequently, the intracellular staining
for IL-17 was performed according to the manufacturer’s
protocol.
In the BRC CRF, flow cytometry, using CD4-PerCP/
Cy™5.5, CD-25PE, CD8-APC was carried out on the BD
FACSCanto™ cell analyzer (BD Bioscience). Intracellular
staining for FOXP3-FITC was performed, as above, in
accordance with manufacturer’s protocol (eBioscience).
Appropriate isotype controls and Fluorescence minus one
controls were used to assign gates and analysis carried out,
using the FlowJo software.

Participant selection criteria

Expansion of Treg lines

staining. IL-17 in supernatants was analysed by an indirect
sandwich ELISA.

Responder CD4+CD25- T cells were obtained from
PBMCs by negative selection using unconjugated antiCD8 (6μL/108cells), anti-CD33 (3μL/108cells) (both
Caltag, California, USA), anti-CD14 (7μL/108cells), antiCD16 (7μL/108cells), anti-CD19 (6μL/108cells), antiCD56 (3μL/108cells), anti-γδ TCR (7μL/108cells) and
glycophorin CD235a (all Diaclone, Gen-probe, San Diego,
USA) antibodies with pan-IgG microbeads and anti-CD25
microbeads (both Invitrogen, Paisley, UK)
Aliquots of the CD4+CD25- cells were cryopreserved
and used as allogeneic responder cells in suppression
assays.
Cryopreserved responder CD4+CD25- T cells
(Teff) were thawed and labelled with 2.5 nM the
carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) (Molecular
Probes, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Responder purity was >95%
(Supplementary Figure 4). 1x105/well of responder T cells
were co-cultured at different ratios (Treg: Teff = 1:1, 1:5
and 1:10) with Tregs in X-Vivo 15 medium supplemented
with 5% HS and activated by anti-CD3/CD28-coated
beads (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) in U-bottom 96-well
plates. Cells were incubated at 37°C, 5% CO2 for 5 days.
After harvest, proliferation of CFSE-labelled responder
cells was determined by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur
or on LSRFortessa™ cell analyzer (BD Bioscience) and
analyzed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc, OR, USA).
The suppressive ability of Treg lines was assessed as the
percentage decrease of Teff proliferation in the presence
of Tregs. The calculation was based on the proliferation of
responder T cells alone compared with the proliferation of
cultures also containing Treg cells.

ELISA
ELISA for human IL-17 was carried out using the
Duo-Set ELISA kit from R&D (Abingdon, UK) according
to manufacturer’s instructions

Cryopreservation of the expanded Tregs in the
CRF
After final harvest, all batches were assessed against
the set release criteria for the ThRIL trial (Supplementary
Table 4) and subsequently cryopreserved. In brief, Treg
numbers equivalent to doses for the ThRIL trial were
resuspended in 2.1ml of CryoStor® CS10 freezing media,
transferred to a CellSeal® Cryovial and placed in a
controlled rate freezer before transfer to liquid nitrogen
(vapor phase) for long-term storage.
In order to assess the recovery of the cryopreserved
product and the effect of cryopreservation on the biology
and function of the final product, cells were thawed,
diluted in 5% human serum albumin, and the viability and
suppressive function of the cryopreserved product was
assessed.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out on GraphPad
Prism 5.0c (GraphPad software Inc. CA, USA). Parametric
and nonparametric data were expressed as mean ± standard
error and median where appropriate. For comparison of
parametric data, paired and unpaired students t-tests were
used. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
*P< 0.05, ** P< 0.01 and *** P< 0.001

Treg culture in the presence of pro-inflammatory
cytokines
Freshly isolated, untreated and rapamycin treated
CD4+CD25+ T cells (5x105) were activated with anti-CD3/
CD28 coated beads at 1:1 bead:cell ratio and cultured
for 5 days in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokine
cocktails: Mix 1: IL-2 (10 IU/ml), IL1β (10ng/ml, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), IL-6 (4ng/ml, R&D
Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) and TGF-β (5ng/ml,
R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). Mix 2: IL-2
(10 IU/ml), IL-21 (25ng/ml, Cell Sciences, Canton, MA,
USA), IL-23 (25ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN,
USA) and TGF-β (5ng/ml, R&D Systems, Minneapolis,
MN, USA). Cells cultured in complete medium
supplemented with IL-2 (10 IU/ml) were used as controls
to ensure their survival throughout the 5-day stability
assay.
At the end of the culture cells were harvested,
