ABSTRACT:
The increasing importance of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) in
tumorigenesis raises the possibility that agents which specifically inhibit this
transcription factor, would provide significant therapeutic benefit. The constitutive
expression of HIF-1α in about 35% of Multiple Myeloma (MM) patients suggests HIF1α suppression might be part of a therapeutic strategy. Accordingly, we explored the
effect of EZN-2968, a small 3rd generation antisense oligonucleotide against HIF-1α,
in a panel of MM cell lines and primary patients samples. Here, we demonstrated
that EZN-2968 is highly specific for HIF-1α mRNA and that exposure of MM cells to
EZN-2968 resulted in an efficient and homogeneous loading of the cells showing
a long lasting low HIF-1α protein level. In MM cells, HIF-1α suppression induced
a permanent cell cycle arrest by prolonging S-phase through cyclin A modulation
and in addition it induced a mild apoptotic cell death. Moreover, HIF-1α suppression
caused a metabolic shift that leaded to increased production of ATP by oxidative
phosphorylation (i.e. Warburg effect reversion), that was confirmed by the observed
mitochondrial membrane potential decrease. These results show that HIF-1α is
an important player in MM homeostasis and that its inhibition by small antisense
oligonucleotides provides a rationale for novel therapeutic strategy to improving MM
treatment.

INTRODUCTION

ARNT), which together form the HIF-1, HIF-2 and HIF3 transcriptional complexes, respectively [3]. HIF-1α
stabilization, is induced at low oxygen tension (hypoxia)
and protein levels are regulated by post-translational
modulation: under normoxic condition (oxygen tension
higher than 3-5% according to cell type), the oxygendependent degradation (ODD) domain is hydroxylated and
ubiquitinated for subsequent proteasomal degradation [4].
The transcriptional network of HIF-1α serves as a master
controller of cellular response to hypoxia and regulates
genes required for adaptation affecting cellular growth,

The hypoxia inducible factor family members (HIFs)
are crucial effectors in either normal cell homeostasis or
tumorigenesis. HIF-1α has been recognized as the most
important player in hypoxia response and it is widely
implicated in tumor survival and progression [1-2]. HIF
proteins are heterodimers of one of three major oxygen
sensitive HIF-α subunits (HIF-1α, HIF-2α or HIF-3α)
associated with a constitutive HIF-1β subunit (also known
as Aryl hydrocarbon Receptor Nuclear Translocator or

metabolism and the angiogenic response [5].
In many cancer cells, abnormal expression of HIF1α has been described [6-11] and associated with induction
of pro-survival signalling pathways (such as MAPK, PI3K
cascades) and c-MYC oncogene, as well as the metabolic
shift known as Warburg effect [12-15]. Moreover, HIF1α activates transcription of genes that play key roles
in critical aspects of cancer biology, including stem cell
maintenance (NOTCH1, WNT-β catenin pathways) [16],
angiogenesis (VEGF, iNOS signalling) [17] and metastasis
[18].
In solid tumors, increased HIF-1α protein
expression has been related to clinical outcome and
associated with higher risk of progression and mortality
[7, 10, 19]. Preclinical data have suggested that HIF-1α
suppression can result in anticancer effects in several
xenograft tumor models [20, 21] and delay of the initial
growth in primary tumors and metastases as shown
in a mouse model of breast cancer [22]. Validation of
HIF-1 as a therapeutic target in solid tumors has been
suggested by both preclinical models and early clinical
trials aimed to evaluate compounds interfering with HIF1 gene regulation either indirectly (DNA intercalators,
topoisomerase I and mTOR inhibitors) or directly (HIF
selective inhibitors) [23]. While an acceptable therapeutic
window of tolerability has been described, the anticancer
role of HIF inhibition has not been established, and the
precise mechanistic consequences of HIF inhibition
remain elusive and may differ in various tumor types.
In Multiple Myeloma (MM), HIF-1α expression
has been described in several cell lines and in about 35%
of CD138+ cells isolated from MM patients samples
[24], suggesting an oxygen independent stabilization of
the protein [25]. In vitro studies have shown that several
signal transducers induced by pro-survival cytokines
(such as STAT3 and MAPK) positively regulate HIF-1α
expression [26]; in addition, deregulation of c-MYC has
been associated with HIF-1α up-regulation [27]. Finally,
in MM cells HIF-1α regulates bone marrow angiogenesis
through the stimulation of vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) [28, 29]. In preclinical studies, the
inhibition of HIF-1α has been shown to enhance the
sensitivity to melphalan [30] and early down-regulation
of HIF-1α expression has been reported in MM cell lines
sensitive to bortezomib and lenalidomide [24]. Recently
TH-302, an hypoxia-activated “prodrug”, was shown
to induce apoptosis in MM cell lines in vitro and in a
xenograft mouse model [31]. Moreover, Storti et al [32]
have also shown that HIF-1α down-regulation by shRNA
produces significant tumor growth inhibition in JJN3 MM
cell xenograft mouse model, associated with inhibition
of angiogenesis and bone destruction. Based on these
data, MM appears to be a good model for evaluating the
mechanism and the biological role of HIF-1α inhibition.
Preliminary data of an ongoing phase 1 trial

www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

in advanced solid tumors testing the small antisense
oligonucleotide EZN-2968, have shown a downmodulation of the target in skin biopsies of some patients
and a favorable safety profile in patients with advanced
solid tumors [33, 34]. In order to clarify the EZN-2968
mechanism of action, in this study, we evaluated the
activity of EZN-2968 against HIF-1α in MM cells. We
showed that HIF-1α mRNA and protein are constitutively
present in MM cells and are further inducible by bone
marrow milieu stimuli (such as IL-6 and IGF-1) even
in normoxic culture conditions. In addition, we analyze
the effect of the EZN cellular treatment on the HIF1α expression level, the relationship between HIF-1α
suppression and MM cells viability, apoptotic death, cell
cycle and the Warburg-phenotype.
Our data strongly support the hypothesis that HIF1α is an important actor in MM homeostasis and that
its inhibition may suppress tumor growth by preventing
proliferation of plasmacells through a delay in S-phase
progression, possibly mediated by the switch towards a
mitochondrial oxidative metabolism.

RESULTS
Constitutional and inducible expression of HIF-1α
in human MM cells
We first investigated the baseline expression of
HIF-1α in four human derived MM cell lines (MM1.S,
RPMI8226, U266 and OPM-2). As shown in Fig. 1A (i)
and (ii), HIF-1α mRNA and protein level were detectable
in all MM cell lines tested under normoxic culture
conditions (pO2 21%). Furthermore, immunofluorescence
analysis of CD138+ cells isolated from bone marrow
aspirates from newly diagnosed MM patients, confirmed
that HIF-1α protein is expressed in MM plasmacells
(Fig. 1B). We next assessed whether pro-survival stimuli
were able to modify HIF-1α expression. As summarized
in Fig. 1C (i) and (ii) a marked up-regulation of HIF-1α
expression, at both transcriptional (+50%) and protein
level (+50%), was observed in MM1.S cells after short
incubation with IGF-1 (100 ng/ml for 4h) whereas a
moderate increase of HIF-1α mRNA (+35%) and protein
level (+15%) was found when cells were treated with IL-6
(50 ng/ml), confirming that HIF-1α can be differentially
induced by biological stimuli. As a positive control,
MM1.S cells were treated with hypoxia-mimicking CoCl2
(100 μM for 24h), which is known to increase baseline
protein levels of HIF-1α.

EZN-2968 efficiently inhibits HIF-1α expression

down-regulation of HIF-1α protein levels in a time
dependent manner. Remarkably, EZN-2968 was able to
deliver into MM cells homogeneously without using any
transfection methods (Supplementary S1). No significant
change of HIF-1α expression was observed in scrambled
oligonucleotide treated MM cells compared to controls.
Incidentally, a down-modulation of HIF-1 expression, at
both transcriptional and protein level was also detected in
hypoxic culture conditions (pO2 1%) (Fig. 2A (i) and (ii)).
To confirm the inhibition of HIF-1α activity,
we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using
anti-p300 antibody, and we showed that the interaction
between p300, a nuclear coactivator of HIF-1α, and HIF-1
was reduced in EZN-2968-treated samples compared to
untreated samples after 48h, suggesting a reduced HIF-1
transcriptional activity (Fig. 2A (iii)).
Owing to the homology in the sequence of the
hypoxia inducible transcription factors, we investigated
whether EZN-2968 was able to influence HIF-2α
expression. As shown in Fig. 2B, in MM1.S cells, HIF2α mRNA expression was not affected by the EZN-2968
treatment. Similar results were also obtained in U266,
RPMI8226 and OPM-2 cell lines (data not shown).
Finally, we tested whether the vascular endothelial
growth factor (VEGF), a downstream target of HIF-1α
transcriptional activity, was modulated by EZN-2968.
MM1.S cells were grown in the presence of either EZN2968 or scrambled oligonucleotide (20 µmol/L) up to 96h.
The media were then collected and VEGF production was
measured by ELISA. We found that the amount of VEGF
in the media was reduced in a time dependent manner
in the EZN-2968 treated MM cells compared to control,
showing a reduction of about 50% when MM cells were
exposed to EZN-2968 for 96h, supporting the direct
involvement of HIF-1 in the control of VEGF release
(Fig. 2C). Moreover, this observation was also confirmed
in immunofluorescence analysis of MM1.S cells treated
with EZN-2968 (data not shown).

To assess the specificity of the compound toward
HIF-1α mRNA, MM cell lines (MM1.S and U266) were
cultured under normoxia (pO2 21%), with either EZN2968 or scrambled oligonucleotide (20 μmol/L) for
up to 72h. As shown in Fig. 2A a long lasting and time
dependent inhibition of both HIF-1α transcription (i) and
protein level (ii) was observed in EZN-treated samples
compared to controls. Moreover, in order to demonstrate
the efficiency of EZN-2968 delivery into MM cells, we
perform immunofluorescence analysis using MM1.S
cells. Notably, EZN-2968 was able to induce a potent

with similar results. Representative data from one experiment

Under normoxia, the viability of MM1.S cell line at
24h, 48h, and 72h was 80%, 77% and 62%, respectively
in the presence of EZN-2968 compared to untreated cells
(Fig. 3A). The viability of MM1.S cell line was similarly
reduced by EZN-2968 treatment under hypoxia, as
compared to normoxic condition (Supplementary S2B).
A similar effect was shown with U266 cell line, whereas
under hypoxia the OPM-2 and RPMI8226 cells showed a
lower sensitivity to EZN-2968 treatment, and the effect
on cell viability was only observed at 72h (Supplementary
S2A and S2B). Subsequently, MM cells were exposed
to either EZN-2968 or scrambled oligonucleotide for up
to 96h, followed by drug washout, and then grown in

drug-free medium for 72h. In drug-free medium, MM
cells showed growth inversely correlated with the time
of previous exposure to the HIF inhibitor (Fig. 3B and
Supplementary S3). In particular, we observed that cell
proliferation was irreversibly affected by exposure to
EZN-2968 as short as 48h. To validate the results obtained
on MM cell lines, we next evaluated the effect of EZN2968 on primary cells from MM patients. As summarized
in Fig. 3C, selective inhibition of HIF-1α resulted in a
similar reduction of cell viability at 24h and 48h, showing
a decrease of about 14% and 28% in CD138+-treated
cells compared to the control, respectively. Notably,
CD34+ cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells
(PBMCs) derived from healthy donors cultured in the
same experimental conditions were not affected by the
treatment (Fig. 3C (i) and (ii)), even when the PBMCs
were stimulated to proliferate non-specifically with
phytohemagglutinin (PHA). Therefore the viability of non
malignant cells was barely sensitive to EZN-2968.

control cells showed the typical characteristic of B cells:
a regular contour, a well-organized rough endoplasmic
reticulum, regularly-shaped mitochondria of uniform
density, and a large nucleus with diffusely and evenly
spread chromatin. When incubated with 20 µmol/L EZN2968 for 24h, some MM1.S cells exhibited a distorted
contour, some mitochondrial damage (swelling and/
or disrupted cristae, matrix density reduction) and/or
clumping of the chromatin (Fig. 4B). These abnormalities
were markedly discernible when cells were treated for 72h
with the HIF inhibitor, as shown in Fig. 4C. Noticeably,
no ultrastructural anomalies were detected in MM1.S
cells incubated with scrambled oligonucleotide at the
same time intervals, suggesting that the structural changes
displayed by MM cells were directly connected with HIF1α inhibition (Fig. 4D).

HIF-1 suppression induces a mild apoptosis and
cell cycle arrest

Ultrastructural study of MM cells after EZN-2968
exposure

We next evaluated whether HIF-1α depletion could
also affect the survival of MM cells. MM1.S cells were
incubated for up to 72h with the HIF inhibitor and the
percentage of cells undergoing apoptotic cell death was
evaluated using AnnexinV/PI staining. After 72h of
incubation with EZN-2968, a moderate percentage of

cell population was positive for Annexin V (12% and
17% of apoptotic cells for MM1.S and U266 cell lines,
respectively) compared to control and scrambled-treated
cells (Fig. 5A (i)), suggesting that a small amount of cells
proceed early toward apoptotic death, as also confirmed by
caspases cleavage at late time points (Fig. 5A (ii)). When
the cell cycle profile was analyzed, treatment with EZN2968 induced a progressive accumulation of MM cells in
S-phase with reduction of G1 and G2/M phase, compared
to controls (Fig. 5B (i) and Supplementary S4). In order
to determine the mechanisms responsible for EZN-2968-

induced S-phase arrest, we investigated the expression of
proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoints control. We
treated MM cell lines with HIF-1α antagonist or scrambled
oligonucleotide (20 µmol/L) for up to 72h and analyzed
by western blot the whole cell lysate. The S-phase delay
in EZN-treated samples was correlated with a marked
increase of cyclin A, cyclin E and cyclin D1 levels as
early as 24h compared to the scrambled group (Fig. 5B
(ii)), suggesting that the cells were able to proceed through
S-phase. Moreover, the expression of cyclin B1 was
reduced when cells were treated with the HIF inhibitor,

cells upon exposure to either EZN-2968 or scrambled oligonucleotide (20 μmol/L) for up to 72h were measured by flow cytometry. Staining

caspase 9 and 3 (ii). Similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. Representative data from one experiment are presented.
(B) Cell cycle analysis was performed using PI staining. EZN-2968 blocked cell cycle progression in G2/M before inducing cell death at
later time points (i). Analysis of proteins involved in cell cycle checkpoint control was carried out by western blotting. MM1.S cells were
incubated with either EZN-2968 or scrambled oligonucleotide for up to 72h and whole cell lysates were then analyzed (ii). Representative
data from one experiment are presented. (C) MM1.S cells were synchronized in S-phase using 2 mM thymidine for 48h and then released
in complete media for additional 24h and 48h in the presence or absence of EZN-2968. Cell cycle profile was analyzed using propidium
iodide (PI) staining (G1: red; S-phase: grey; G2/M; orange), and the corresponding percentages were reported under each histogram. Data
were performed in two independent experiments with similar results. Representative data from one experiment are presented.

indicating that the cells were not longer able to enter the
M phase. Because Cdc25C is induced during S-phase,
we evaluated whether the Cdc25C signalling pathway is
relevant in determining the EZN-induced S-phase cell
cycle arrest. As shown in Fig. 5B (ii), the expression of
Cdc25C was up-regulated in treated samples compared to
the control, further supporting that HIF inhibition directly
correlates with S-phase cell cycle delay. Interestingly, upregulation of the cyclin A was observed either in p53 wildtype (MM1.S) and in p53 mutant (RPMI8226, and OPM2) MM cell lines, suggesting a p53 independent regulation
(data not shown). To confirm our results, we first treated
MM1.S with thymidine (2 mM) to synchronize cells in
S-phase and, after adequate wash out we cultured the
cells in the presence of EZN-2968 for an additional 24h
and 48h. Cell cycle profiles showed about 50% of cells in
S-phase at each time point in EZN-2968-treated samples

compared to controls (Fig. 5C). Similar results were
obtained in U266, RPMI8226 and OPM-2 cell lines (data
not shown). Taken together these data suggest that HIF-1α
inhibition delays cell cycle progression by arresting cells
in S-phase with only a minority of population proceeding
to apoptotic death. The mechanism of HIF inhibitioninduced S-phase arrest might involve both Cdc25C
signalling pathway and cyclin A up-regulation.

Biochemical phenotype of MM cells surviving
EZN-2968 exposure
Among the hallmarks of many cancer cells is the
reduced mitochondrial function and increase of glycolysis
to generate ATP even in the presence of normal oxygen
tension, the so-called Warburg effect [39]. A number
of studies have associated HIF-1 to this metabolic
shift, suggesting us that EZN-2968 could modulate the
mitochondrial function of myeloma cells by reducing the
HIF-1α gene expression and HIF-1 level. The biochemical
phenotype of MM cells was analyzed on viable cells
obtained by removing both early and late apoptotic
cells from EZN-2968/scrambled-treated or untreated
samples. As shown in Fig. 6A, the EZN-2968 treatment
of transformed cells results in significant increase of
total cell protein content, being maximum at 24h and
slightly lower at 48 and 72h. Similarly, the activity of
citrate synthase (CS), a critical enzyme in the control
of the mitochondrial flux through the trycarboxylic acid
cycle, was found to increase upon exposure to EZN-2968,
suggesting that the pharmacological treatment could also
induce mitochondrial mass enhancement (Fig. 6B). This
observation pushed us to evaluate the effect of EZN-2968
on the ATP cellular content and the mitochondrial ATP
synthesis rate (i.e. Oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthase
activity, OS-ATPase). Indeed, both ATP level (Fig. 6C)
and OS-ATP synthesis rate (Fig. 6D) were significantly
enhanced by EZN-2968 cell treatment, reaching a 25-30%
increase at 24h of exposure. Since citrate synthase is an
index of the cell mitochondrial mass [40], we normalized
the OS-ATP synthesis rate to CS, resulting in a ratio that
expresses the efficiency of the mitochondrial oxidative
phosphorylation (OXPHOS) machinery. As shown in Fig.
6E the OXPHOS efficiency of MM cells was not altered
by the pharmacological treatment at any time examined.
Finally, the effect of EZN-2968 on the endogenous
mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨmit), a crucial
parameter of mitochondrial function [38, 40] strictly
bound to OXPHOS, was examined by cytofluorometric
analysis of TMRM loaded cells. Fig. 7 shows that EZN2968 treatment of MM cells decreased ΔΨmit as detected
by both the TMRM mean fluorescence intensity (Fig.
7 (i)) and the distribution of the cell population (Fig. 7
(ii)). Notably, fluorescence intensity and distribution of
TMRM loaded cell samples were evaluated with respect

DISCUSSION

to the parameters obtained in the presence of FCCP, a
protonophore capable to uncouple the mitochondrial
respiration from ADP phosphorylation by dissipating the
transmembrane proton gradient originated by respiration,
therefore FCCP reduces ΔΨmit to its minimum. Moreover,
ΔΨmit resulted significantly reduced at any time examined
of the cells exposure to the HIF-1α inhibitor, as revealed
by the decreased mean fluorescence intensity (Fig. 7B).
This time-independent behaviour clearly indicates that
EZN-2968-treated myeloma cells are more prone than
controls to produce ATP via OXPHOS, contributing to the
observed intracellular ATP level enhancement together
with the observed mitochondrial mass increase.

The major finding of the present study is the
demonstration that HIF-1α suppression in MM cells
reduces their viability by inducing cell cycle arrest in
the S-phase and pushes cells towards a mitochondrial
oxidative metabolism.
We have shown that established MM cell lines
and primary CD138+ cells under normoxic conditions
accumulate aberrant HIF-1α protein confirming previous
data reported by Hu et al. [30]. In addition, we have shown
that the locked nucleic acid antisense oligonucleotide
EZN-2968 can reverse the HIF-1 dependent angiogenic

and metabolic effects in MM cells. Notably, the effects of
the oligonucleotide were obtained by simply incubating
the molecule with the MM cells (i.e. avoiding transfection
protocols).
Besides being induced by environmental hypoxia
or growth factors, HIF-1α expression and stabilization in
MM cells can arise from genetic abnormalities such as loss
of tumor suppressor activity [12, 15]. Of note, in recent
studies the c-MYC proto-oncogene, which is de-regulated
in about 30–50% of patients with advanced MM and is
associated with a poor prognosis [41], has been shown
to promote either constitutive HIF-1α protein activation,
or aberrant VEGF production by plasmacells (PCs) and
angiogenesis under normoxic conditions [27, 41, 42].
In the present study, we have shown that inhibition of
HIF-1α expression reduces VEGF release by MM cells,
suggesting an anti-angiogenic activity of EZN-2968.
Because angiogenesis is one of the most powerful drivers
of MM progression, we believed of interest to characterize
the effects of drugs capable to interfere with the HIF-1
induced pathways.
Interestingly, we observed that EZN-2968 causes
cell cycle arrest in S-phase preventing the progression
to mitosis. Progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle
is controlled by the cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks)
[43]. As a result of EZN-2968 exposure, we observed a
modulation of important proteins involved in cell cycle
checkpoints. Indeed, the expression of Cyclin E and
Cyclin A were signiﬁcantly increased, whereas M-phase
Cyclin B1 was markedly down-regulated. In particular,
Cyclin E is a critical regulator of the G1/S transition,
and its over-expression, after genotoxic stress, such as
γ-irradiation, has been reported to induce apoptosis of
hematopoietic cells through activation of the caspase
cascade [44]. This pro-apoptotic effect was associated
with an increased production of cyclin E/Cdk2 kinase
activity [45]. Moreover, in agreement with previous
studies on solid tumors [46], inhibition of HIF-1α gave
rise to a progressive accumulation of cells in S-phase,
while only a small percentage of cells entered in apoptotic
phase. Therefore, our data suggest that EZN-2968induced S-phase arrest resulted from enhanced initiation
and progression of S-phase and concomitant inhibition
of mitosis progression. Based on these observations, we
speculate that HIF-1 inhibition first activates the Cyclin E/
Cyclin A pathway, causing S-phase arrest, then it triggers
caspases activation, eventually leading to apoptotic cell
death after prolonged exposure, supporting the view that
HIF-1α inhibition may be an attractive therapeutic strategy
for MM.
Moreover, IGF-1, one of the most crucial growth
factors for MM cells, was clearly shown to enhance HIF-1
levels, supporting that HIF-1α lies downstream of the IGF1 signalling pathway in MM cells [30].
The benefit of EZN-2968 employment as a
therapeutic molecule in MM clinical treatment was also
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

supported by the biochemical phenotype of EZN-2968–
treated MM cells. We showed that the HIF-1α pathway has
major effects on MM cells and demonstrated that EZN2968 treatment can reverse the Warburg cell phenotype
pushing tumor cells towards a normal cell metabolism.
Approximately, 60% to 90% of cancers display
the so-called Warburg phenotype, characterized by
dependence on glycolysis as the major source of energy,
irrespective of the oxygen level [47,48]. Due to the
Warburg effect, pyruvate, the end product of glycolysis,
is mainly converted into lactate by lactate dehydrogenase
A (LDH-A) that is up-regulated in transformed cells. As
recently reported, the Warburg effect is operative in MM
cells, that are characterized by high expression levels
of glycolytic enzymes and by the key regulators of the
Warburg effect, LDHA and PDK1 [25]. In the present
study, we have demonstrated that treatment with EZN2968 (i) increases the mitochondrial mass, (ii) enhances
the cell’s ability to produce ATP via OXPHOS and (iii)
that MM cells are forced to produce ATP via OXPHOS
pushing the oxygen dependent oxidative metabolism
as clearly shown by both the increased OXPHOS rate
and the decrease of the endogenous mitochondrial
membrane potential. Interestingly, the major structural
and functional mitochondrial features of MM cells match
the main characteristics of human fibroblasts adapted to
hypoxia as it has been recently reported by Baracca et al.
[49], confirming the central role of HIF-1 in the control
of cell metabolism. One of the novelty of the present
study is that the suppression of HIF-1α in MM cells
induces morphological and functional changes leading to
reversal of the Warburg effect, that parallels the return of
fibroblasts to the normoxic metabolism [49].
Despite availability of several therapeutic agents,
MM still remains an incurable disease. Thus, the
development of new therapies are urgently needed.
Because elevated expression of HIF-1α protein has been
correlated with drug resistance and overall poor treatment
outcome, compounds that inhibit HIF-1α may have broad
utility in the control of cancer growth [23]. Although many
small molecules affect HIF-1α levels indirectly [23], none
of them specifically inhibits HIF-1α. In this study we used
a novel and highly specific antagonist of HIF-1α mRNA
(EZN-2968), which potently and selectively reduces HIF1α mRNA and protein levels. While several criticisms
have been raised concerning the use of oligonucleotides
because of their poor delivery into the cells, herein we
clearly demonstrate that EZN-2968 has a high delivery
efficiency into MM cells avoiding any transfection
protocols. This intrinsic feature of EZN-2968 increases
its possible employment as a therapeutic molecule in
clinical practice. Moreover, the present study discloses
novel mechanisms that support the anticancer action of
EZN-2968 adding further interest to its specificity and
well tolerance as revealed in Phase I studies. Furthermore,
agents that inhibit HIF-1α may be particularly well suited

for combination therapy with other anticancer agents. In
conclusion, our study highlighted the role of HIF-1α as
a critical regulator of MM cells, providing evidence that
PCs homeostasis is sustained by HIF-1α and therefore HIF
inhibition can represent a main target for MM therapy.

Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with an automated RNA extraction

Immunofluorescence Microscopy analysis

Electron microscopy

Cells set on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides for
3h were fixed and permeabilized following standard
protocols, and then incubated overnight at 4°C with
primary HIF-1α antibody (1:1000 in 1% BSA in
PBS). Incubation with secondary antibody (anti-rabbit
conjugated with FITC from Santa Cruz Biotechnology
1:2000) was performed for 2h at room temperature
followed by 15 min incubation with DAPI (1:100 dilution
in PBS). Images were obtained using an Axiovert 40 CFL
microscope (Carl Zeiss MicroImaging GmbH, Germany)
using 100X objective, and analyzed using the AxioVision
4.7 imaging system software.

The ultrastructural features of treated and control
MM1.S cells were investigated by transmission electron
microscope (TEM). To maintain the natural morphology,
cells were rapidly washed and fixed in Karnowsky
fixative (2% glutaraldehyde, 4% formaldehyde in 0.1M
phosphate buffer) directly in culture plate for 20 min at
room temperature (RT). After mechanical removal with
scraper, the cells were pelleted, fixed again with the same
fixative for 24h at 4°C and processed for TEM analysis.
After a post-fixation in 1% buffered osmium tetroxide for
1h at RT, samples were dehydrated through graded ethanol
and embedded in Araldite resin. Serial semi-thin sections
were obtained with an ultramicrotome and stained with
Toluidine blue. Grids containing ultrathin sections were
contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before
observing with a Philips 400T (FEI Company, Milan,
Italy) transmission electron microscope.

ELISA Assay
VEGF levels secreted by MM cells treated with
EZN-2968 or scrambled oligonucleotide (20 μmol/L)
were quantified using Human VEGF Quantikine® kit
(R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) according to
the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell cultures media were
harvested for up to 96h. All standards and samples were
tested in triplicate.

Annexin V staining and cell cycle analysis
Cellular apoptosis was evaluated using FITC
Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit I (BD Pharmingen™),
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Cell
fluorescence and PI uptake were measured by mean of
a FACScan flow cytometer and a dedicated software
(FACS Canto2, BD Pharmingen™). Cell cycle analysis
was evaluated using the PI/RNase Staining Buffer
(BD Pharmingen™), according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. PI uptake was measured by mean of a
FACScan flow cytometer and analyzed with ModFitLT
version 3.1 (Verity software).

Cell viability assessment
Cell viability was measured by MTT colorimetric
survival assay (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).
In brief, cells were plated in 96 well plates at density
of 50.000 cells/well. EZN-2968/EZN-3088 were added
at the concentration indicated and compared with the
controls. Cultures were then incubated for up to 96h in
a 37°C incubator with 5% of CO2. Optical absorbance
of the culture medium was then measured using a
multiplate reader (Multiskan Ex Microplate Photometer,
Thermo Scientific, Meridian Rd, Rockford, USA). Each
experiment was done in triplicate.

Biochemical assays
The Biochemical phenotype of EZN-2968 treated
MM cells was analyzed on viable cell samples using a Cell
Death Removal Kit (Miltenyi Biotec Inc.).
Protein content was determined by the method of
Lowry [36] and the viable cells were counted by means
of the trypan blue exclusion test. The cellular protein
content was expressed as μg of protein/106 cells. Citrate
synthase activity was assayed as previously reported
[37]. Essentially, cells were incubated with 0.02% Triton
X-100 and the reaction was monitored by measuring
spectrophotometrically the rate of free coenzyme A
released. The enzyme activity was expressed as nmol/
min/106 cells. The oligomycin-sensitive ATP synthase
activity was measured in permeabilized myeloma cells
according to the luminometric method described by
Sgarbi et al [37]. Essentially, cells (5 x 106 cells/ml)
were permeabilized with 60 μg/ml digitonin in a Tris/Cl
buffer (pH 7.4). The reaction was started by adding 10

Cell death commitment assay
The minimum exposure of MM cells to EZN2968 required to commit them to death was evaluated by
incubating cells in well plates with EZN-2968 (20 μmol/L)
for up to 96h. Following incubation, the cells were washed
twice to remove any residual drug, and then incubated
in drug-free medium for up to 72h. MM cell survival
was quantified by MTT survival assay and expressed as
percentage of the respective controls value.

Mitochondrial membrane potential (∆Ψmit) was
measured by staining the cells in a non-quenching mode
[38]. Cells were loaded with 20 nM tetramethylrhodamine
methyl ester (TMRM) (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR,
USA) which accumulates in the mitochondrial matrix
in a ∆Ψmit-dependent manner. The myeloma cells were
incubated with the dye solution for 30 min at 37°C
and then washed with PBS to remove any remaining
unincorporated dye. The pellet was resuspended in HBSS
and immediately analyzed with a FACScan flow cytometer
(FACS Canto2, BD Pharmingen™). Excitation was at
488/10 nm and fluorescence emission was measured at
585/42 nm. Data acquisition and analysis was performed
by BD DIVA 2 software.
