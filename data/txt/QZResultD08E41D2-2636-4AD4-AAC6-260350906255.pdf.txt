BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing using Hybrid Capture 2 assay with ThinPrep Papanicolaou (Pap) collection is the only US Food and Drug Administration-approved method for the triage
of women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS). Although SurePath Pap collection has been used for Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing, clinical validation of this method has been
scarce. METHODS: From a cervical cancer-screening program in Mississippi, we analyzed data from screenings of 8380 women with ASCUS Pap results who underwent reflex Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA tests during a course of 4 years. Of these, 4145 were screened with the ThinPrep collection system, and 4235 were
screened with SurePath. Results of follow-up biopsies within 3 months of Pap tests were available for the
ThinPrep group (229 cases) and the SurePath group (455 cases). Hybrid Capture 2 positive rates and the
follow-up biopsy results from both groups were compared. RESULTS: Hybrid Capture 2 detected high-risk
HPV DNA in 68.8% of ThinPrep and 66.7% of SurePath-collected specimens (P ¼ .37). Detection rates for
CIN2þ and CIN3þ were also comparable between ThinPrep (21.4%, 3.1%) and SurePath (15.4%, 4.2%) using
Hybrid Capture 2 (P ¼ .06, P ¼ .45). In ThinPrep-collected specimens, 4.4% were quantitatively insufficient
for Hybrid Capture 2 testing. Significantly more equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results were observed in SurePath (11.4%) than in ThinPrep specimens (3.2%). However, 67.4% of women with equivocal Hybrid Capture 2
results had negative 1-year Pap cytology follow-up in the SurePath group. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid Capture

KEY WORDS: SurePath, ThinPrep, human papillomavirus, Hybrid Capture 2.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection with high-risk
types is responsible for the development of >99% of cervical
carcinomas and high-grade cervical precancerous lesions,
that is, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3 (CIN 2/
3).1-3 This well-established etiological link between HPV
and cervical carcinomas/precancerous lesions has prompted
clinical utilization of HPV DNA testing in cervical dysplastic
clinics and cervical cancer prevention programs to predict
cervical carcinoma/precancerous lesions. In the United
States, HPV DNA testing has been integrated into cervical
cancer screening programs and has become the standard of
care in the triage of women with Papanicolaou (Pap) cytology test results of atypical squamous cells of undetermined
significance (ASCUS).4 In addition, HPV DNA testing has
been more frequently used along with Pap cytology testing
for coscreening women aged 30 years.5
To date, Hybrid Capture 2 (Qiagen, Valencia,
Calif) HPV DNA testing assay using ThinPrep Pap collection devices (Hologic, Marlborough, Mass) is the only
US Food and Drug Administration-approved HPV DNA
testing method in the triage of women with ASCUS Pap
results and coscreening of women aged 30 years by Pap
cytology testing. The Hybrid Capture 2 assay uses
DNA:RNA hybridization with RNA probes that are complementary to 13 high-risk HPV genotypes (16, 18, 31,
33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68). The specific
HPV DNA:RNA hybrids formed in solution can be captured by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated antibodies
bound to the solid-surface of a microtiter plate. After
chemiluminescent reagent is added, the captured HPV
DNA:RNA hybrids emit luminescent signals that can be
detected by a luminometer. The intensity of the luminescent signals is proportional to the quantity of the targeted
DNA in the specimen, and the results are reported as relative light units (RLUs). Because Hybrid Capture 2 is not a
target amplification assay and uses DNA:RNA hybridization, cross-contamination can be minimized. Hybrid
Capture 2 testing is also fully automated, with high interlaboratory reproducibility.6 The Hybrid Capture 2 HPV

DNA testing assay is by far the most extensively studied
and documented HPV DNA testing assay. More importantly, it was clinically validated in the ASCUS low-grade
squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) triage study, a
strictly controlled, randomized clinical validation.7 The
ASCUS LSIL triage study demonstrated a higher clinical
sensitivity in detecting CIN2-3 and a lower referral rate
for colposcopy using reflex Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA
testing compared with repeat Pap testing.7 In the United
States, a few commercial liquid-based Pap collection devices have been used for Pap cytology testing as well as reflex
HPV DNA testing. In addition to ThinPrep, the SurePath (BD Diagnostics, TriPath, Burlington, NC) Pap collection device is also used for Pap cytology testing and for
Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing. Although the US
Food and Drug Administration granted approval to use
the SurePath Pap collection device for Pap cytology testing, and recently also approved the automated screening
system (BD FocalPoint GS Imaging System), the Hybrid
Capture 2 HPV DNA testing with SurePath Pap specimen is still under Food and Drug Administration evaluation. One major impediment is the lack of a randomized
clinical validation study, such as the ASCUS LSIL triage
trial. Such research requires a considerable budget for colposcopy and biopsy confirmation in a study population
that is large enough to generate the statistical power to
reach a conclusion. To use a non-Food and Drug Administration-approved SurePath Pap collection device, most
institutions conducted their own validation testing.
To date, only 2 validation studies of Hybrid Capture
2 DNA testing with SurePath Pap specimens have been
published.8,9 The ASCUS LSIL triage trial and other
well-documented studies using ThinPrep Pap collection
have laid out a solid basis for Hybrid Capture 2 clinical
application. Hybrid Capture 2 results using the SurePath
collection system are usually compared with those in the
ASCUS LSIL triage trial to evaluate the testing efficacy of
Hybrid Capture 2 assay.8 In Mississippi, Hybrid Capture

has been implemented in the cervical cancer-screening
program since 2003. From 2003 to 2005, the Mississippi
State cervical cancer-screening program used the SurePath
Pap cytology collection device for Hybrid Capture 2 HPV
DNA testing. In 2005 the state shifted Pap cytology collection from SurePath to ThinPrep. This provided an opportunity to compare the 2 most commonly used Pap
cytology collection systems. The large screening population was predominantly a cohort of young African American women. In this study, we evaluated Hybrid Capture 2
HPV DNA testing in SurePath and ThinPrep specimens
from women with ASCUS results by comparing Hybrid
Capture 2 positive rates and follow-up biopsies.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
The institutional review board (IRB) at the University of
Mississippi Medical Center approved this study (IRB
2008-0004). The IRB waived the requirement for written
consent.
Study Population
From the Tri-Regional Cervical Cancer Screening Management Project sponsored by the Mississippi State
Health Department at the University of Mississippi
Medical Center, we retrospectively collected data from
records of women who had Pap results of ASCUS and
reflex HPV DNA testing using the Hybrid Capture 2
assay. From November 2003 to August 2005 (22
months), 124,300 women were screened using specimens
collected by the SurePath collection system (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Of these, 4235 women
had Pap results of ASCUS and reflex Hybrid Capture 2
HPV DNA tests. After the switch from SurePath to the
ThinPrep collection system, 114,979 women were
screened from October 2005 to December 2007 (27
months). Of these, 4145 women who had ASCUS Pap
results were tested for HPV DNA using Hybrid Capture
2 assay. These 8380 women were included in this study.
Liquid-Based Pap Cytology Testing

The SurePath Pap specimens were collected and processed according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The specimens were processed by centrifugal sedimentation through
a density gradient to partially remove nondiagnostic debris
320

and inflammatory cells. The concentrated cells were resuspended in 1000 lL of buffered deionized water. An aliquot
of 200 lL of cell-rich suspension was then used to prepare
a SurePath slide using a Prepstain slide processor (Becton
Dickinson). The residual cell suspension (800 lL) was used
for Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing.
The ThinPrep specimens were processed according
to the manufacturer’s guidelines using a ThinPrep 3000
processor (Hologic). In this process, part of the specimen
passes through a 20-mm-diameter polycarbonate filter to
remove nondiagnostic debris and inflammatory cells. A
variable fraction of a specimen was used to achieve an
optimal cell density for ThinPrep slides. Once the optimal
cell density was obtained, the filter stamped these cells on
a ThinPrep glass slide. The remaining specimen was used
for Hybrid Capture 2 DNA testing.
Both SurePath and ThinPrep specimens were processed at the Department of Pathology, the University of
Mississippi Medical Center. Following the Bethesda System, the Pap slides were screened by cytotechnologists
and verified by cytopathologists at the Department of Pathology, the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA
Testing and Validation
The residual specimens from either SurePath or ThinPrep
liquid-based Pap specimens were processed for Hybrid
Capture 2 HPV DNA testing at the Department of Pathology, the University of Mississippi Medical Center. Hybrid
Capture 2 testing was performed using high-risk HPV kit
#5199-1220 (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The high-risk HPV panel consisted of 13
types of HPV (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58,
59, and 68). The RLU readings were obtained using a
DML 2000 luminometer (Qiagen). The positive cutoff
value was determined by the mean of the positive control
samples. The ratio of the RLUs from the patient sample to
the positive cutoff value was determined. For a ratio <1,
the result was classified as negative. In the specimens with a
ratio >1 but with an RLU <1000, the result was considered equivocal. For a ratio >1 with an RLU >1000, the
result was considered positive.

HC2 Testing in SurePath and ThinPrep/Siddiqi et al

DNA testing for SurePath specimens. A total of 111 cervical
specimens were collected using a split-sample collection
method for SurePath (Becton Dickinson) and PreservCyt
(Hologic). Pap results were classified as normal, ASCUS,
and squamous intraepithelial lesion. Hybrid Capture 2 testing was performed in Pap specimens collected in both Pap
collection systems. By using PreservCyt as a standard,
Hybrid Capture 2 results from SurePath specimens were
evaluated for each patient. The SurePath yielded 1.8% falsepositive results, 2.7% false-negative results, and 9.9% equivocal results. The cutoff limits for positive, negative, and
equivocal categories were determined by taking all of this information into account. The women with equivocal Hybrid
Capture 2 results were followed up for 1 year. The majority
of these women tested negative for high-risk HPV DNA.
Follow-Up Biopsy and Pap Cytology
Follow-up biopsy specimens were processed and interpreted at the Department of Pathology, the University of
Mississippi Medical Center. We retrieved and compared
the results of the follow-up biopsies performed within
90 days (3 months) after Pap testing from 446 women in
the SurePath group and 229 women in the ThinPrep
group. The follow-up biopsies were classified as benign,
CIN1, CIN2, and CIN3. No carcinoma case was observed
in the study group. One-year follow-up Pap cytology
results were collected and compared from 301 women
from the SurePath group and 77 women from the ThinPrep group with equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results.
Statistics and Data Analysis
Descriptive statistics were calculated. The Wilcoxon rank
sum test was used to assess the difference in continuous

variables between women using ThinPrep and SurePath
Pap testing. The chi-square test was performed to assess
the association between the tests and disease status. P values (2-sided test) of <.05 were considered significant. All
computations were carried out using SAS version 8.0
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

RESULTS
The Study Population
Ages ranged from 9 to 65 years in the SurePath group,
with a mean of 23.0 years, and 12 to 62 years in the ThinPrep group, with a mean of 25.4 years. In the SurePath
group of 4235 women, 2870 (67.8%) women were African American, 1174 (27.7%) were Caucasian, and 191
(4.5%) were from other ethnic populations, such as Hispanic American, Native American, or Asian American. In
the ThinPrep group of 4145 women, 2635 women
(63.6%) were Africa American, 1274 (30.7%) were Caucasian, and 236 (5.7%) were from other ethnic groups
(Table 1). The age distribution is illustrated in Table 2. In
the ThinPrep group, there were significantly fewer

HPV DNA Testing Using Hybrid Capture 2
HPV DNA was detected in 2915 (68.8%) SurePath specimens and 2640 (66.7%) ThinPrep specimens (Table 2).
The Hybrid Capture 2 positive rates were not significantly
different between the SurePath and ThinPrep groups (P
¼ .37). When Hybrid Capture 2 results were stratified by
age, Hybrid Capture 2 positive rates in the 2 groups were
comparable in women aged 20 years (P ¼ .12-.52). The
Hybrid Capture 2 positive rate was significantly lower in
women aged 19 years in the SurePath group (75.1%)
than in the ThinPrep group (83.0%) (P<.001) (Table 2).
In both the SurePath and ThinPrep groups, Hybrid Capture 2 positive rates decreased significantly with age, from
75.1% in women aged 19 years to 35.4% in women age
40 years in the SurePath group (P-trend <.001) and
from 83.0% in women aged 19 years to 33.0% in
women aged 40 years in the ThinPrep group (P-trend
<.001).
Significantly more equivocal Hybrid Capture 2
results were observed in the SurePath cases (484, 11.4%)
than in the ThinPrep group (134, 3.2%) (P<.001).

Comparison of Follow-Up Pap Cytology
and Biopsy Results in Women With
Equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 Results
Of 484 cases of SurePath Pap specimens with equivocal
Hybrid Capture 2 results, 62.2% (301 of 484) had follow-up Pap tests, and 9.7% (47 of 484) had follow-up biopsy in 1 year. In ThinPrep specimens with equivocal
Hybrid Capture 2 results, 1 year follow-up Pap tests and
biopsies were performed in 57.5% (77 of 134) and 14.9%
(20 of 134), respectively (Table 4). Of the 301 SurePath
specimens with follow-up Pap tests, 203 (67.4%) were
classified as negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy, whereas 60% (46 of 77) of ThinPrep specimens
with equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results were classified as
negative for intraepithelial lesion or malignancy. The rates
of abnormal Pap results including ASCUS, LSIL, and
high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (HSIL) were
comparable (P ¼ .689) between the SurePath and ThinPrep groups.

HC2 Testing in SurePath and ThinPrep/Siddiqi et al

Follow-up biopsies showed 24 cases of CIN1 and 5
cases of CIN2-3 in the SurePath group and 12 cases of
CIN1 and 5 cases of CIN2-3 in the ThinPrep group. Similarly, no significant differences were observed between
SurePath and ThinPrep in follow-up biopsies with abnormal results (P ¼ .204) (Table 4).

DISCUSSION
In this retrospective study, we compared the ThinPrep and
SurePath collection system results for Hybrid Capture 2
HPV DNA testing. We collected data encompassing 4 years
of records (totaling 8380 women) who had Pap results of
ASCUS and reflex Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing
in a state-sponsored cervical cancer-screening program. Of
these women, 4235 had Pap tests using specimens collected
by the SurePath system, and 4145 had Pap tests using
specimens collected by the ThinPrep system. We observed
no statistically significant differences in Hybrid Capture 2
positive rates in the 2 groups as a whole or by age except
for women aged 19 years. In the 684 follow-up biopsies
performed within 3 months of Pap cytology testing, no significant difference in detection rates for CIN2þ or
CIN3þ were observed between the SurePath and ThinPrep groups. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that SurePath is comparable to ThinPrep Pap
collection using Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing assay
for predicting CIN2-3 in women with ASCUS results.
Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA testing in the triage of
women with ASCUS Pap results has proven to have higher
sensitivity in predicting CIN2þ than repeat Pap cytology
testing. In the ASCUS LSIL triage trial, the ThinPrep Pap
collection device was used to collect cervical specimens.
From 4 institutions in the United States, 3488 women
with ASCUS Pap results were enrolled in the study. Hybrid
Capture 2 HPV DNA testing had a sensitivity of 95.9% to
detect CIN2þ and a positive predictive value of 19.6%
when CIN2 was used as the cutoff threshold.7 In a pooled
meta-analysis including 20 studies on the triage of ASCUS,
Arbyn et al demonstrated an overall Hybrid Capture 2 sensitivity of 92.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.1%94.9%) and 95.6% (95% CI, 92.8%-98.4%) for detecting
CIN2þ or CIN3þ, respectively.10
Because the ASCUS LSIL triage trial is the most
comprehensive randomized clinical validation study in
the triage of women with ASCUS using the Hybrid CapCancer Cytopathology

October 25, 2009

ture 2/ThinPrep method, it has frequently been used as a
gold standard to evaluate Hybrid Capture 2 clinical validation in other liquid-based cytology specimens, such as
SurePath. Recently, Ko et al, at Massachusetts General
Hospital, compared Hybrid Capture 2 DNA testing in
2319 women with ASCUS Pap results using SurePath
Pap collection with the ASCUS LSIL triage trial.8 The
study showed a similar sensitivity (93.4%), negative predictive value (95.7%), and positive predictive value
(17.5%) to predict CIN2þ compared with the ASCUS
LSIL triage trial. The strength of their study is that biopsy
data were available for both Hybrid Capture 2 positive
(485) and negative (140) cases to generate calculated clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and
negative predictive value.
In our study, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive
predictive value of Hybrid Capture 2 testing to predict
CIN2-3 cannot be estimated because of the lack of biopsy
data from women with negative Hybrid Capture 2 results.
Instead, we present a back-to-back comparison of the 2 liquid-based Pap collection methods in the same cervical cancer-screening program. In addition to showing similar
Hybrid Capture 2 positive rates stratified by age between
the 2 Pap collecting devices, we observed similar positive
predictive values of Hybrid Capture 2 testing between SurePath (15.4%) and ThinPrep (21.4%) for detecting CIN2þ
(P ¼ .06). For detecting CIN3, which is more clinically relevant, our study also showed similar rates, with 4.2% in the
SurePath group and 3.1% in the ThinPrep group (P ¼
.45). By comparison, Ko et al observed 17.5% positive predictive value for CIN2þ in the Massachusetts General Hospital cohort, which was similar to that in our SurePath
group. However, their positive predictive value for CIN3þ
(7.8%) was higher than that of our SurePath group.8 We
speculate that the lower rate of CIN3 in our study might be
partially attributable to the younger age in our screening
population, with a mean of 23.0 years in SurePath and
25.4 years in ThinPrep; CIN3 diagnosis usually peaks in
women aged 25 to 30 years.11 By using CIN3þ as a cutoff
threshold, our data in both SurePath (4.2%) and ThinPrep
(3.1%) were comparable to those in the ASCUS LSIL triage trial (5.1%) and the pooled meta-analysis, including 20
studies by Arbyn et al (4.3%; 95% CI, 2.7%-5.9%).10
The Hybrid Capture 2 positivities in our SurePath
and ThinPrep cohorts were at the high end compared with
the range in published studies, with 68.8% in the SurePath

group and 66.7% in the ThinPrep group. In the ASCUS
LSIL triage trial with combined data from 4 institutions in
the United States, the Hybrid Capture 2 positive rate was
56.1%.7 Ko et al, at Massachusetts General Hospital,
observed a 40.1% Hybrid Capture 2 positive rate.8 The
positive rate from the pooled 20 Hybrid Capture 2 studies
was 42.3% (95% CI, 38.1%-46.3%). Our high Hybrid
Capture 2 positivity may also be associated with the
younger age of women in the screening program: 23.0 years
old in the SurePath group and 25.4 years old in the ThinPrep group, compared with the average age of 29 years in
the ASCUS LSIL triage trial.7 Age-dependent Hybrid Capture 2 HPV positivity has been well documented.12 The
prevalence of HPV infection is higher among young
women and decreases with age. It has been recognized that
HPV infections in young women are more likely to be transient than persistent.12,13 Therefore, HPV infection in
younger women has significantly less clinical implication.
We also observed significantly decreased Hybrid Capture 2 positivities with age in both the SurePath and ThinPrep groups in women with ASCUS Pap results in our
study. To reduce unnecessary colposcopy and biopsy, the
protocol of the cervical cancer-screening program in Mississippi was modified in August 2006 in accordance with the
2006 Consensus Guidelines, with a recommendation that
women aged 20 years with ASCUS Pap results no longer
be screened with a reflex Hybrid Capture 2 HPV DNA
test. As a consequence, we observed significantly fewer
young women aged  20 years in the ThinPrep (15.2%)
than in the SurePath group (33.0%). This change might
also affect Hybrid Capture 2 positivity in this age group,
which showed a significantly higher Hybrid Capture 2 positivity in the ThinPrep group (83.0%) than in the SurePath
group (75.1%). We therefore believe that Hybrid Capture
2 data collected from this age group may not be comparable between the 2 groups because of the biased specimen
selection for Hybrid Capture 2 testing in the ThinPrep
group. The main limitation in our study, the inability to
randomize because of its retrospective nature, means that
the younger mean age in the SurePath group might result
in a higher Hybrid Capture 2 positive rate in SurePath
specimens of all ages, although it must be said that the difference we found was not statistically significant.
In our study, we observed a significantly higher
insufficiency rate in ThinPrep (4.5%) than in SurePath
(0) collection for Hybrid Capture 2 testing and a signifi324

cantly higher rate of equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results
in the SurePath group (11.4%) than the ThinPrep group
(3.2%). We speculate that differences in specimen processing contributed to the high insufficiency rate for
Hybrid Capture 2 testing with ThinPrep and the high
equivocal rate of Hybrid Capture 2 results with SurePath.
SurePath, which uses a density gradient to remove
nondiagnostic debris, has the advantage of preserving cells
proportionally for Hybrid Capture 2 testing. Because
only a small aliquot of resuspended cells (1=5) is used for
producing a cytology slide, a significant portion of the
material is available for Hybrid Capture 2 testing. Therefore, specimen insufficiency for Hybrid Capture 2 testing
is rare. Recently, Alsharif et al reported a low insufficiency
rate (0.23%) for the SurePath Pap test.14 In contrast,
ThinPrep, using a filter to remove nondiagnostic debris,
was designed to optimize cell density for cytology slide
preparation during specimen processing. Therefore, specimens with low cellularity may lead to sample insufficiency
for a subsequent Hybrid Capture 2 testing.
In women with equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results,
Pap and biopsy follow-up results were comparable between
the SurePath and ThinPrep collection methods. We speculate that the higher Hybrid Capture 2 equivocal rate in
SurePath specimens (11.4%) compared with that in ThinPrep specimens (3.2%) might also be associated with differences in specimen processing. When nondiagnostic debris is
removed using density gradient, a fraction of specimens
containing cervical epithelial cells may also be removed,
resulting in more cell loss than is the case for the filter-based
method of the ThinPrep system. Knoepp et al, at Massachusetts General Hospital, observed 4% equivocal Hybrid
Capture 2 results in SurePath, which is substantially lower
than our equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results.9 We cannot
make a direct comparison between the 2 studies, because
different cutoff values were used to define equivocal Hybrid
Capture 2 results at the 2 institutions. In 191 cases of SurePath specimens with Hybrid Capture 2 equivocal results,
Knoepp et al, retested Hybrid Capture 2 and observed 93%
(178 of 191) positive rates in the first retest. In 1-year Pap
cytology follow-up, Knoepp et al observed abnormal Pap
results in 83% of ASCUSþ samples. Therefore, the authors
conclude that the equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results
should be considered as positive Hybrid Capture 2 results
based on their Hybrid Capture 2 retesting and follow-up
results. In the cervical cancer-screening program in

HC2 Testing in SurePath and ThinPrep/Siddiqi et al

Mississippi, women with equivocal Hybrid Capture 2
results were followed up by annual Pap screening tests and
not by retesting with Hybrid Capture 2. Although we do
not have repeat Hybrid Capture 2 testing results for a comparison, the annual Pap cytology follow-up results in the 2
studies can be compared. From 301 women who had equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results and the annual Pap cytology
follow-up results, we observed predominantly negative for
intraepithelial lesion or malignancy (67.4%) Pap results,
whereas Knoepp’s study showed predominantly ASCUS
(79%) Pap results. Although we observed higher LSIL
(15.3% vs 4.5%) and HSIL (2.0% vs 0.5%) than did
Knoepp’s study, collectively, we observed 32.6% with
ASCUS compared with 84% with ASCUS in Knoepp’s
study. The clinical significance of equivocal Hybrid Capture
2 results in our study appears different from that in
Knoepp’s study. Because women with equivocal Hybrid
Capture 2 results in our cervical cancer screening were managed with annual Pap tests without repeating Hybrid Capture 2 test, the higher equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 rate in
SurePath specimens in our study did not result in a substantial increase in colposcopic follow-up. Predominantly negative Pap cytology follow-up in our study lends further
support to the current clinical management for women who
had ASCUS and equivocal Hybrid Capture 2 results, especially in a state cervical cancer screening program with a limited budget. Our observation with regard to equivocal
Hybrid Capture 2 results from women with ASCUS suggests that in practice, the clinical significance of equivocal
Hybrid Capture 2 results should be based on an in-house
evaluation to determine the best clinical management for
women in a given practice setting, either in dysplasia clinics
or in cervical cancer screening programs.
