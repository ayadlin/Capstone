ABSTRACT
Cancer is a major cause of death throughout the world, and there is a large need
for better and more personalized approaches to combat the disease. Over the past
decade, synthetic lethal approaches have been developed that are designed to exploit
the aberrant molecular origins (i.e. defective genes) that underlie tumorigenesis. BLM
and CHEK2 are two evolutionarily conserved genes that are somatically altered in a
number of tumor types. Both proteins normally function in preserving genome stability
through facilitating the accurate repair of DNA double strand breaks. Thus, uncovering
synthetic lethal interactors of BLM and CHEK2 will identify novel candidate drug targets
and lead chemical compounds. Here we identify an evolutionarily conserved synthetic
lethal interaction between SOD1 and both BLM and CHEK2 in two distinct cell models.
Using quantitative imaging microscopy, real-time cellular analyses, colony formation
and tumor spheroid models we show that SOD1 silencing and inhibition (ATTM and
LCS-1 treatments), or the induction of reactive oxygen species (2ME2 treatment)
induces selective killing within BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells relative to controls.
We further show that increases in reactive oxygen species follow SOD1 silencing and
inhibition that are associated with the persistence of DNA double strand breaks, and
increases in apoptosis. Collectively, these data identify SOD1 as a novel candidate
drug target in BLM and CHEK2 cancer contexts, and further suggest that 2ME2, ATTM
and LCS-1 are lead therapeutic compounds warranting further pre-clinical study.

of genes somatically altered in cancer will uncover novel
candidate drug targets whose inhibitors represent lead
therapeutic agents.
Recent gene re-sequencing efforts have uncovered
a myriad of somatic mutations and deletions in genes
associated with DNA double strand break (DSB) repair
pathways [3, 4]. Somatic alterations of these cancer genes
are correlated with genome instability (i.e. DNA damage
and chromosome instability) [5], which contributes to
the acquisition of subsequent mutations, some of which
confer growth advantages that can enhance tumor growth
and metastasis. For example, BLM and CHEK2 are
somatically altered in a number of tumor types including
CRC [3, 4, 6], and normally function within the homology
directed repair (HDR) pathway (“error-proof” DSB repair
pathway). More specifically, BLM is a member of the
RECQ helicase family, and harbors ATP-dependent 3′-5′

INTRODUCTION
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a major cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2015, the American
Cancer Society estimates that ~132,700 Americans will
be newly diagnosed and ~50,000 additional individuals
will succumb to the disease in 2015 [1]. These statistics
highlight the need for novel personalized therapeutic
strategies designed to better combat the disease. Synthetic
lethality is one such strategy, and is defined as the lethal
combination of two independently viable mutations. In
a cancer context, a cancer-driving mutation is leveraged
to lethality through the down-regulation (i.e. silencing or
inhibition) of a synthetic lethal (SL) interactor (i.e. drug
target) [2]. Thus, synthetic lethality exploits the causative
genetic aberrations synonymous with tumor development
and progression. Accordingly, identifying SL interactors

DNA helicase activity (reviewed in [7]), which is required
for HDR [7–12]. In addition, germline mutations in BLM
are pathogenic for Bloom syndrome, an inherited disorder
associated with an increased predisposition to develop
many tumor types including CRC [13]. CHEK2 is a tumor
suppressor that regulates genome stability [14]. It normally
functions in HDR by inducing cell cycle checkpoints
so that DSBs can be accurately repaired [15–18]. Thus,
aberrant CHEK2 activity is associated with checkpoint
defects, inadequate DNA repair, and cancer development.
Accordingly, identifying novel strategies and candidate
drug targets capable of exploiting genetic defects in BLM
and CHEK2 are highly warranted.
In this study, we couple siRNA-based silencing
and chemical compounds with semi-quantitative imaging
microscopy, real time cellular analyses (RTCA), and
biochemical assays to show that BLM and CHEK2 are
SL with SOD1. We demonstrate that BLM- and CHEK2deficient CRC cells are selectively killed following
SOD1 silencing and recapitulate these findings within
an additional and unrelated cellular content. We
further show that two SOD1 inhibitors (ammonium
tetrathiomolybdate [ATTM] and Lung Cancer Screen-1
[LCS-1]) and one chemical mimetic (2-methoxyestradiol
[2ME2]) phenocopy the SOD1 silencing results by
inducing preferential killing within BLM- and CHEK2deficient cells. Using semi-quantitative microscopy and
RTCA, we show that all three chemicals induce reactive
oxygen species (ROS), promote persistent DNA DSBs
and potentiate cellular cytotoxicity through an apoptotic
mechanism. Finally, we show that drug treatments
significantly decrease the number and size of BLMand CHEK2-deficient cells in 2D colony and 3D tumor
spheroid formation assays, respectively. Collectively, our
data shows that BLM and CHEK2 are SL with SOD1, and
further identify 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 as lead candidate
compounds warranting further pre-clinical study.

and CHEK2 expression was confirmed in all cell lines by
Western blots. All cells were grown in a 37°C humidified
incubator with 5% CO2.

Gene silencing
Cells were transiently transfected with siRNA
duplexes using RNAiMax (Invitrogen) as described
[20]. ON-TARGETplus (Dharmacon) siRNA duplexes
targeting SOD1, BLM, CHEK2, GAPDH and PLK1
were employed as either individual duplexes or pools
(four distinct duplexes targeting the gene of interest), as
detailed previously [20]. Gene silencing was confirmed by
Western blots using the antibodies and dilutions indicated
in Supplementary Table 1.

Direct SL tests
High-content microscopy was used to evaluate the
SL interactions as detailed elsewhere [20]. Briefly, 8,000
BLM-deficient, CHEK2-deficient and control (HCT116)
cells, and 4,000 hTERT cells were automatically dispensed
into each well of a 96-well plate (BioTek; EL406). Cells
were transfected in sextuplet (i.e. 6-wells) with either
individual or pooled siRNAs targeting BLM, CHEK2,
SOD1, and controls (GAPDH and PLK1) as described
[20]. Cells were permitted to grow for 4- (HCT116) or
5-days (hTERT) following which cells were fixed (4%
paraformaldehyde), and counterstained with Hoechst
33342 (Sigma; 0.2 μM). Images were acquired using a
Cytation 3 (BioTek) equipped with a 10× objective (0.3
numerical aperture), a 16-bit gray scale charged couple
device camera, and GEN5 software. Twelve central
and non-overlapping images were acquired per well
(condition), and the total number of cells in each well and
condition were determined. All data were imported into
Prism v6.0 (GraphPad), normalized to GAPDH silenced
controls, and basic statistical analyses (e.g. mean, standard
deviation, Student’s t-tests, etc.) were performed. To
address reproducibility all experiments were conducted a
minimum of 3-times.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture
HCT116 (BLM-proficient and CHEK2-proficient)
cells were purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. BLM-deficient and CHEK2-deficient, HCT116
cells were generously provided by Dr. Bert Vogelstein
(Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore). All HCT116 cells
were grown in McCoy’s 5A medium (HyClone) containing
10% fetal bovine serum. Immortalized (telomerase) BJ
normal human skin fibroblasts, hTERT, were generously
provided by C.P. Case [19] (University of Bristol, Bristol,
UK) and were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10%
fetal bovine serum. Cells were authenticated based on
the recovery, viability, growth and morphology, while
parental HCT116 and hTERT cells were also authenticated
by spectral karyotyping as detailed elsewhere [20]. BLM

Dose response curves
Standard dose response curves were generated
as detailed previously [20] using a 10-fold (100pM
to 1M) serial dilution for 2ME2, ATTM, or LCS-1 [21].
Briefly, ~8,000 cells were seeded into each well of a
96-well plate, permitted to attach, and growth medium
supplemented with appropriate concentrations of 2ME2,
ATTM, LCS-1 or vehicle control (DMSO) were added
to wells in sextuplet. Following 3-days of growth, cells
were fixed, counterstained, imaged and analyzed as above.
All data were normalized to DMSO-treated controls and
half maximal effective concentrations (EC50) values
were determined. The EC50 values calculated from the
27908

BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells were employed in all
subsequent experiments.

2ME2, ATTM, or LCS-1 were supplemented into growth
medium when cells attained ~25% of their untreated
maximal values (~48 h post seeding) and growth was
monitored for up to 7-days. All data were imported into
Prism and growth curves were plotted for each condition
of treatment.

ROS detection
ROS were detected using the Image-IT LIVE
Green ROS detection kit (Molecular Probes) as detailed
elsewhere [20] with minor modifications. Briefly, 8,000
cells were seeded into each well of a 96-well plate, and
permitted to attach. The following day, SOD1 or GAPDH
were silenced in control, BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells
for 48 h or cells were treated with compounds (2ME2,
ATTM, LCS-1 and DMSO) for 6 h. Each condition was
performed in sextuplet and repeated two additional times.
Images were acquired (Cytation 3), signal intensities were
determined from raw, unprocessed images (GEN5), and
semi-quantitative analyses were performed as described
[20, 22]. All data were imported into Prism, normalized to
untreated controls, and basic statistical analyses (e.g. mean,
standard deviation, Student’s t-tests, etc.) were performed.

ROS scavenging/chemical rescue
N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) was used to scavenge
excessive ROS. The maximum tolerated dose of NAC
was determined for BLM-deficient (2 μM) and CHEK2deficient (5 μM) cells by RTCA. RTCA was performed as
above, but with media supplemented with DMSO, 2ME2,
ATTM or LCS-1 with or without NAC. All data were
imported into Prism where growth curves were plotted.

Colony formation and 3D tumor
spheroid assays
The effect of prolonged DMSO, 2ME2, ATTM
and LCS-1 treatments was determined using a standard
28-day colony forming assay as described [20], and
tumor spheroid assays as directed by the manufacturer
(InSphero). In brief, 1,000 BLM- or CHEK2-deficient,
or control cells were dispensed into GravityPLUS plates,
and tumors were permitted to form for 2-days, whereupon
they were released into GravityTRAP plates and cultured
in growth medium containing DMSO, 2ME2, ATTM,
or LCS-1. Media containing DMSO, 2ME2, ATTM,
or LCS-1 were replaced every 2- to 3-days. Cells were
incubated for 14-days, at which point nuclei were
counterstained with Hoechst 33342, and the medial plane
of each tumor spheroid was imaged using a Cytation 3
(10× objective; NA = 0.13). ImageJ was employed to
determine the maximal diameter of the spheroid [23].
All data were imported into Prism, normalized to the
appropriate DMSO-treated control, and Student’s t-tests
were performed. Finally, all experiments were performed
in sextuplet and repeated at least two additional times.

Quantitative imaging microscopy
Semi-quantitative imaging microscopy was
employed to evaluate the presence of DNA DSBs as
represented by the total signal intensities of two surrogate
markers, namely γ-H2AX and 53BP1, as described
previously [20, 22]. Briefly, 8, 000 cells were seeded
into each well of a 96-well plate, permitted to attach, and
grow for 48 h. Next, cells were treated with Bleomycin
(0.1 μg/mL) for 2 h, DMSO for 42 h, or 2ME2, ATTM
and LCS-1 for 6 h. The media from a subset of wells
containing 2ME2, ATTM, and LCS-1 was aspirated,
washed once with pre-warmed phosphate buffered saline
(pH 7.4), replaced with fresh growth media lacking 2ME2,
ATTM and LCS-1, and cells were permitted to grow for
an additional 36 h. Following washout and recovery,
cells were processed for semi-quantitative microscopy
as detailed [20], and images were acquired as described
above (Direct SL Tests). Each condition was performed in
sextuplet and repeated at least two additional times with
γ-H2AX and 53BP1 signal intensities determined from
raw, unprocessed images. Apoptosis was evaluated by
quantifying the total signal intensity of cleaved Caspase 3
as described previously [20]. All data were imported into
Prism and were normalized to the appropriate negative
or vehicle control. Antibodies and working dilutions are
presented in Supplementary Table 1.

RESULTS
BLM and CHEK2 are synthetic lethal
with SOD1
To identify novel and lead candidate drug targets
to evaluate in a CRC context, we recently employed a
cross-species candidate gene approach and identified the
SL interactors of yeast genes whose human orthologs
are somatically altered in CRC. We queried BioGRID
[24] and identified all SL interactions for the 692 yeast
chromosome instability genes [20]. As an entry point,
two-dimensional hierarchical clustering was performed
[20], and a collection of 30 genes each harboring > 22
SL interactors were identified. This collection was highly

Real time cellular analyses
RTCA were performed in quadruplicate and
repeated twice using an xCELLigence RTCA-dual
plate (DP) system (Acea Biosciences) as detailed [20].
Approximately 8,000 cells were seeded into each well
of an E-Plate (Acea Biosciences) and growth (electrical
impedance) was measured every 10 minutes. DMSO,

enriched for genes encoding functions within DSB repair,
particularly HDR including sgs1 and dun1, which are the
yeast orthologs of human BLM and CHEK2, respectively.
Interestingly, sgs1 and dun1 are SL with several members
of the evolutionarily conserved superoxide dismutase
pathway, including superoxide dismutase-1 (yeast sod1/
human SOD1). This pathway normally functions to
remove excess ROS through a two-step process initially
regulated by SOD1, which requires Cu2+ as an essential
co-factor [25, 26]. Excessive ROS induce a variety of
cellular damage including DSBs, which we presumed
would not be accurately repaired in HDR-defective cells
(e.g. BLM and CHEK2-deficient), and would underlie
cell cytotoxicity. Accordingly, SOD1 represents a strong
candidate to pursue in a cross-species approach designed
to identify novel drug targets (i.e. SL interactors) for BLM
and CHEK2.
In budding yeast, sgs1 and dun1 are SL with sod1
[27]. To determine whether SOD1 is SL with BLM
and CHEK2 in humans, we employed an established
siRNA-based approach [20, 28]. Briefly, BLM-deficient
(or CHEK2-deficient) and control HCT116 (BLM- and
CHEK2-proficient) cells are silenced with either individual
or pooled siRNAs targeting SOD1 and controls (GAPDH),
and the total number of cells remaining is statistically
compared. A SL interaction is expected to result in fewer
cells within the deficient cell lines. Before performing
the SL tests, we first confirmed BLM and CHEK2
expression levels within all cell lines by Western blots
(Supplementary Figure 1), and evaluated the silencing
efficiency of two individual (siSOD1–2 and siSOD1–3)
and pooled (siSOD1-P) siRNA duplexes (Figure 1A).
Next, we performed direct SL tests and as predicted there
were visually striking decreases in the number of BLMand CHEK2-deficient cells relative to controls (Figure
1B) that quantitative imaging microscopy determined to
be statistically significant (Figure 1C and Supplementary
Table 2). Further scrutiny of the images revealed a
population of BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells exhibiting
hallmarks of apoptosis including nuclear blebbing and
increased chromatin condensation that were not readily
apparent within the controls (Figure 1B). Collectively,
these data suggest that SOD1 silencing selectively induces
cytotoxicity within BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells,
and further suggest that these genetic interactions are
evolutionarily conserved.
Although the above observations suggest BLM and
CHEK2 are SL with SOD1, it remains possible that the
putative interactions are due to background mutations
that accrued during the generation of the BLM- and
CHEK2-deficient cells. To assuage this possibility, dual
siRNA experiments (e.g. BLM plus SOD1 silencing)
were performed within the parental, HCT116 cells. In
agreement with the above data, Figure 1D shows that the
simultaneous silencing of either BLM or CHEK2 with
SOD1 resulted in fewer cells than each condition alone,
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

or the expected number as calculated by a multiplicative
model (Supplementary Table 3). The percentage of
cells remaining was similar and ~60% with either the
individual or pooled approaches for both BLM and
CHEK2. Although the total decrease in cell numbers was
not as large as with the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells
employed above, we attribute this to the residual proteins
remaining following siRNA-based silencing compared
with the their complete absence within the BLM- and
CHEK2-deficient cells (Supplementary Figure 2).
To extend these findings beyond the HCT116 context
employed above, analogous dual siRNA-based experiments
were performed in hTERT, a karyotypically stable and
immortalized fibroblast cell line. Western blots were first
performed to confirm silencing efficiencies (Supplementary
Figure 3), and in agreement with the HCT116 findings,
dual siRNA-based silencing (siBLM/siCHEK2 and
siSOD1) resulted in fewer hTERT cells than expected
using a multiplicative model (Supplementary Figure 4 and
Supplementary Table 4). Collectively, these data support
the evolutionarily conserved SL interaction between BLM
or CHEK2 and SOD1, and further demonstrate that these
interactions are independent of cell type.

2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 induce selective
Killing in BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells in
a ROS-dependent manner
Having established that BLM and CHEK2 are
SL with SOD1, we now wished to determine if three
chemical compounds, 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 predicted
to phenocopy SOD1 silencing could substitute for the
siRNAs and induce death specifically within the BLMand CHEK2-deficient cells. While 2ME2 induces ROS
including superoxide anions [29], ATTM and LCS-1 are
a Cu2+ chelator [26] (required for SOD1 activity) and a
SOD1 inhibitor [21] respectively. Prior to evaluating
the SL interactions, standard dose response curves were
generated for each compound within the BLM- and
CHEK2-deficient, and control cells. As predicted, the
BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cell lines are hypersensitive to
each compound relative to controls (Figure 2). In addition,
increases in cells exhibiting apoptotic hallmarks were also
observed within the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells
following treatments. Table 1 presents the EC50 (effective
concentration at which 50% of the cells remain relative
to DMSO-treated controls) values calculated for the
BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells relative to controls. In
support of chemogenetic SL interactions, the EC50 values
for 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 are approximately 193-,
54- and 3, 150-fold lower, respectively, in BLM-deficient
cells, while they are approximately 1,230-, 1,175- and
1,892-fold lower in CHEK2-deficient cells, respectively.
Finally, a fluorogenic ROS indicator coupled with semiquantitative imaging microscopy and was employed to
confirm that 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 treatments each

induce ROS formation (Supplementary Figure 5), which
also occurs following SOD1 silencing (Supplementary
Figure 6).
To determine if the diminished cell numbers were
due to cell cycle arrest or cellular cytotoxicity RTCA (i.e.
growth curves) were performed. RTCA employs electrical
impedance as a measure of cellular proliferation and can
easily discern altered growth rates from cell cycle arrests
and cellular cytotoxicity. To restrict the therapeutic effect
to BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells, we specifically
employed the EC50 values determined for those cells. As
predicted, the growth curves generated for the control
cells (Figure 3A) were virtually indistinguishable
irrespective of treatment (e.g. 2ME2, ATTM, LCS-1 and
DMSO). However, there was considerable variation in the
growth curves generated within the BLM- and CHEK2deficient cells (Figure 3A), with each showing a rapid
decline in cell index that is indicative of cell cytotoxicity.
More specifically, within the BLM-deficient cells, 2ME2
and LCS-1 gave superimposable growth curves with a
cell index marginally lower (0.5 a.u.) than that of DMSO
treated controls, whereas ATTM treated cells had an
increase in cell index (1.4 a.u.) approximately 1-day
post-treatment. Approximately 2-days post-treatments,
there was a rapid decline in the cell index in each of the
condition of treatment that was not readily apparent in
the DMSO treated controls. On the other hand, within the
CHEK2-deficient cells, 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 treated
cells showed a markedly high cell index (1.2, 5 and 3 a.u.,
respectively) when compared to DMSO treated controls
in 24 hours of treatment with the chemical compounds,
which is likely due to a temporary cell cycle arrest and
flattening of the cell body (unpublished observation)
causing an increase in cellular contacts and thus electrical
impedance. Following a temporary arrest as evidenced
by a plateau in cell index, there was a rapid and sharp
decline in cell index that occurred approximately 2-days
(2ME2), 3-days (LCS-1), or 4-days (ATTM) posttreatment. The rapid declines in cell indices for BLMand CHEK2-deficient cells treated with 2ME2, ATTM
and LCS-1 are indicative of strong cytotoxic effects, and
are in agreement with the images exhibiting apoptotic
hallmarks (see Figure 1B). These data further show that
2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 have minimal impact on the
growth of control cells indicating that the compounds and
concentrations employed are selective to the BLM- and
CHEK2-deficient cells.

To determine if oxidative stress (i.e. ROS
generation) was required to induce the cytotoxicity
observed above, NAC, an established ROS scavenger
was employed in phenotypic rescue experiments. In all
instances, NAC addition was sufficient to restore the
growth of the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells treated
with 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 to those of the vehicle
control (Figure 3B). Collectively, these data indicate that
2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 induce preferential cytotoxicity
in the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells, and further show
that ROS contributes to the cytotoxic effect.

2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 induce persistent DNA
DSBs in BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells
We now sought to determine the underlying
mechanism contributing to the increases in cytotoxicity
observed within the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells
treated with 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1. Since oxidative
stress induces various types of cellular damage including
DSBs [30–32], we reasoned that excessive DSBs caused
by treatments would not be adequately repaired in
HDR-defective cells, and would ultimately lead to cell
cytotoxicity. Accordingly, the prevalence and persistence
of DSBs was evaluated by semi-quantitative imaging
microscopy at various time points using two wellestablished surrogate markers for DSBs, namely γ-H2AX
and 53BP1. As expected, visually apparent and statistically
significant increases in γ-H2AX and 53BP1 signal
intensities within BLM- (Figure 4), CHEK2-deficient
(Supplementary Figure 7) and control cells treated with
2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 for 6 h relative to DMSO treated
controls. However, following compound washout and a 36
h recovery phase, γ-H2AX and 53BP1 intensities remained
elevated within the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells, but
returned to basal levels within the controls. Thus, these
data support the premise that 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1
treatments induce ROS formation that promotes persistent
DNA DSBs, which cannot be adequately repaired within
the BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells, and underlies the
observed increases in cell cytotoxicity.

2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 treatments induce
apoptosis in BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells
Although the above data show that BLM- and
CHEK2-deficient cells are hypersensitive to 2ME2,

the corresponding DMSO-treated controls for all three compounds and in both cell lines.

ATTM and LCS-1 treatments, they do not address the
underlying mechanism of death. However, recall that
further scrutiny of images acquired following SOD1
silencing or compound treatments suggest apoptosis may
be a contributing factor. Accordingly, we now wished
to formally examine whether apoptosis contributes to
the cytotoxicity observed within the BLM and CHEK2
chemogenetic interactions identified above. Using semiquantitative imaging microscopy and an antibody against
cleaved Caspase 3, a key downstream apoptotic regulator,
we evaluated apoptosis in cells treated with 2ME2, ATTM
and LCS-1. As anticipated, BLM- and CHEK2-deficient
cells treated with compounds exhibited statistically
significant increases in the abundance of cleaved Caspase
www.impactjournals.com/oncotarget

3 relative to controls (Figure 5). More specifically, a 2.7to 3.0-fold increase in DMSO-normalized cleaved Caspase
3 signal intensities occurred within the BLM- and CHEK2deficient cells relative to controls. These data show
that apoptosis contributes to the cytotoxicity observed
following 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 treatments within the
BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells.

were conducted 28-days in which DMSO, 2ME2, ATTM
or LCS-1 was supplemented into growth media that was
replaced every 2-days. In agreement with the above
findings, statistically significant decreases were observed
for the total number of BLM- and CHEK2-deficient
colonies treated with 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 relative to
controls (Figure 6A). Next, the efficacy of the compounds
was evaluated in 3D tumor sphere models. Tumor spheres
were generated (see Materials and Methods) and treated
with compounds or vehicle control, with media (with and

without compounds) replaced every 2 days. Following
a 14-day incubation period, nuclei were counterstained,
tumor spheres were imaged and the sizes (diameters) were
determined. In general, there was a statistically significant
and ~10-fold decrease in the relative size of all BLM- and
CHEK2-deficient tumor spheres treated with 2ME2, ATTM
and LCS-1 relative to controls (Figure 6B). Collectively,
these data indicate that 2ME2, ATTM, and LCS-1 treatments
decrease the total number of BLM- and CHEK2-deficient
colonies, and also the sizes of 3D tumor spheres, suggesting
each is a strong lead candidate therapeutic compound.

DISCUSSION

potential as anti-angiogenic agents. In the current study,
we repurposed these chemicals to induce SL killing
within two specific genetic contexts (i.e. somatic BLMor CHEK2-deficiencies). Thus, it is possible that 2ME2,
ATTM or LCS-1 treatments in BLM- or CHEK2-deficient/
defective tumors may induce anti-angiogenic effects that
will synergize with the SL interactions to prevent tumor
vascularization while inducing SL killing.
Although the primary goal of this work is to exploit
somatic mutations in BLM and CHEK2, it is possible
that 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 may also be effective in
familial cancers, in much the same manner that PARP1
inhibitors are being evaluated in the context of familial
breast and ovarian cancers harboring inherited defects in
BRCA1/2. In a familial cancer context, all individuals are
expected to inherit a single wile-type allele and a mutant
allele, and it is the subsequent loss of heterozygosity that
contributes to the development of familial tumors. Thus,
it may be possible to selectively target familial cancers
as the non-cancerous (i.e. normal) cells are expected to
harbor a single wild-type copy of BLM or CHEK2, and
produce sufficient protein to render these cells resistant to
a SL attack.
Over the five past years, there have been numerous
successful approaches designed to identify SL interactors
of cancer-associated genes, with the ultimate goal of
identifying novel drug targets. In 2013, Vizeacoumar
et al [48] performed a genome-wide screen to uncover
negative genetic interactions (i.e. SL interactors) across
a set of isogenic cancer cell lines, including the BLMdeficient cells employed in the current study. Interestingly,
they did not identify SOD1 as a lead SL interactor, which
we attribute to two fundamental differences between our
studies. First, Vizeacoumar and colleagues employed a
microarray-based approach that is based on the loss of
the bar-coded shRNAs within a population of cells, which
may not have occurred within the timeframe of their
experiment. Second, and perhaps most likely, although
SOD1-induced killing is robust within our study, it may
not have fallen below the operational threshold required
for subsequent validation within their study. Nevertheless,
our data complement their findings, and expands the
number of validated SL interactors and drug targets of
BLM-deficient cells.
The current study provides the first evidence that the
dun1 sod1 SL interaction first identified in yeast [27], is
evolutionarily conserved in a human cancer context. More
specifically, we identify SOD1 as the first SL interactor
and drug target capable of exploiting genetic defects in
CHEK2. CHEK2 is a particularly attractive and unexplored
gene to examine in direct SL tests as it has an established
role in HDR [49], it is normally required for chromosome
stability [50, 51], and mutations are associated with both
familial and sporadic cancers [52–55]. However, CHEK2
is also of interest as a therapeutic target that can potentiate
the cytotoxic effects associated with DNA damage,

In this study, we evaluated the ability of SL
interactions initially identified in yeast to predict
evolutionarily conserved interactions within a human cell
context. Specifically, we sought to determine the ability
of SOD1 silencing and inhibition to exploit defects within
two genes, BLM and CHEK2, which normally encode
functions within the HDR pathway. Using two isogenic
cell models we demonstrate that SOD1 silencing induces
preferential killing within BLM- and CHEK2-deficient
cells, and show that these SL interactions are conserved in
an unrelated and immortalized cell type. We further show
that three chemicals predicted to functionally substitute
for SOD1 silencing also induce preferential killing
within BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells in short (5-day),
moderate (14-day) and long-term (28-days) assays in
both 2D culture and 3D tumor models. Finally, we show
that each compound induces ROS, is associated with
increases in DNA DSBs, and correlates with increases
in apoptosis within BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells.
Accordingly, this study identifies two evolutionarily
conserved SL interactions, namely BLM SOD1 and
CHEK2 SOD1, and defines SOD1 as a novel candidate
drug target in cancers harboring BLM and CHEK2 defects.
Finally, our data identify 2ME2, ATTM and LCS-1 as
lead candidate compounds warranting further pre-clinical
study. Collectively, this study underscores the utility of SL
datasets generated in model systems (e.g. budding yeast)
to uncover evolutionarily conserved and cancer-relevant
interactions that will assist in cancer drug target discovery.
SOD1 is highly conserved throughout evolution [33]
and its central role in the removal of superoxide radicals
and the prevention of excessive oxidative DNA damage is
well established in model organisms and humans [34, 35].
SOD1 is a non-essential gene in yeast [36] and mice [37],
and the transient nature of treatments is predicted to have
minimal impact on normal human cells. Moreover, the
EC50 values employed in this study are specific to the
BLM- and CHEK2-deficient cells, and are significantly
lower than those of the controls (54- to 3, 150-fold). With
respect to the compounds, ATTM has been employed
for unrelated pathologies, while 2ME2 and LCS-1
remain relatively unexplored. For example, ATTM was
originally employed to treat copper poisoning in livestock
[38], while in humans it is commonly used to treat
Wilson’s disease, a neuropsychiatric disorder resulting
from Cu2+ accumulation. Most recently, ATTM is under
investigation for its anti-angiogenic potential based on its
ability to prevent endothelial cell homing, cell motility
and invasiveness [39–43]. In 2011, Somwar et al [21]
identified LCS-1 as a selective SOD1 inhibitor and showed
it induced killing in lung cancer cells. Most recently,
several studies have begun to explore the susceptibility
of vascular endothelial cells to ROS [44–47], suggesting
SOD1 inhibitors and ROS inducers may hold additional

radiation or chemotherapeutic compounds including
camptothecin [56], PARP inhibitors or doxorubicin
[57]. With the knowledge that CHEK2 regulates TP53mediated apoptosis [58], another therapeutic strategy
has been to target CHEK2 activity to sensitize TP53deficient cells to compounds that induce genotoxic stress
[59, 60]. In 2009, Jiang et al [60] demonstrated that
following CHEK2 depletion, TP53-deficient cells were
sensitized to doxorubicin, while the TP53-proficient cells
were resistant. Although speculative, we predict that the
simultaneous depletion of CHEK2 in combination with
SOD1 silencing or 2ME2, ATTM or LCS-1 treatments
may further exacerbate the sensitivity of TP53-deficient
cells to doxorubicin. Thus, targeting SOD1 may have
additional therapeutic implications beyond the BLM and
CHEK2 genetic contexts explored in the current study.
A major goal of the current study was to determine
whether SOD1 was a shared SL interactor for genes
involved in HDR in humans. Beyond the BLM and
CHEK2 contexts examined in the current study, SOD1
may represent a common therapeutic target capable of
exploiting many additional genetic defects. Extensive SL
data generated in budding yeast [27, 61, 62] have shown
that members of a given biological pathway (e.g. HDR)
frequently share SL interactors. We previously showed
that RAD54B, a gene that encodes a helicase functions
within the HDR pathway is also SL with SOD1 [20].
While RAD54B is somatically altered in ~3.3% of CRCs
[3, 4, 6], BLM and CHEK2 are mutated in up to 4.1%
[6] and 6.9% [3, 4, 63], respectively. Thus, mutations in
these three genes alone account for ~14.4% of all CRCs,
which amounts to ~19,000 Americans annually who may
be potentially responsive to a SOD1-directed therapy.
Due to the evolutionarily conserved nature of these SL
interactions, it appears that SOD1 is a putative therapeutic
hub that may harbor addition SL interactions with other
HDR genes. Although speculative, this list could include
other key HDR genes including ATM, BRCA1/2, MRE11,
RAD50, NBS1 or RAD51, which are also mutated in
CRC and many other tumor types. Furthermore, somatic
mutations of SOD1 are rare in cancer, and those few
that do occur are mutually exclusive of those occurring
for RAD54B, BLM and CHEK2 [3, 4, 6, 64–67]. These
observations suggest that mutations leading to a loss
of function for SOD1 are not tolerated in cancer cells
harboring pre-existing mutations within RAD54B, BLM or
CHEK2, and further support SOD1 as a strong candidate
therapeutic target. Finally, SOD1 may also represent
an attractive therapeutic target beyond CRC. Although
RAD54B, BLM and CHEK2 genes are mutated in CRC,
they are also mutated in numerous additional cancers
including pancreatic (~16.5% collectively), prostate
(~16.7%), melanoma (~15.1%) and endometrial (~8.8%).
Thus, studies aimed at exploring SOD1 as a candidate
drug target in other HDR-defective gene contexts, and
tumor types are highly warranted.
