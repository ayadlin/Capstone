Abstract
The TGF-b pathway is under active consideration as a cancer drug target based on its capacity to promote
cancer cell invasion and to create a protumorigenic microenvironment. However, the clinical application of TGFb inhibitors remains uncertain as genetic studies show a tumor suppressor function of TGF-b in pancreatic cancer
and other epithelial malignancies. Here, we used genetically engineered mouse models to investigate the
therapeutic impact of global TGF-b inhibition in pancreatic cancer in relation to tumor stage, genetic proﬁle,
and concurrent chemotherapy. We found that avb6 integrin acted as a key upstream activator of TGF-b in
evolving pancreatic cancers. In addition, TGF-b or avb6 blockade increased tumor cell proliferation and
accelerated both early and later disease stages. These effects were dependent on the presence of Smad4, a
central mediator of TGF-b signaling. Therefore, our ﬁndings indicate that avb6 and TGF-b act in a common
tumor suppressor pathway whose pharmacologic inactivation promotes pancreatic cancer progression. Cancer

Introduction
The transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b) signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved regulator of embryonic
patterning and cell differentiation, and has central roles in
wound healing and inﬂammation (1). The activated TGF-b
receptor (TGF-bR1/R2) phosphorylates the Smad2 and Smad3
proteins, which modulate transcription in association with
Smad4. This pathway has been the subject of intense investigation in cancer due to its potential to act in both a pro- and
antitumorigenic manner (2). Depending on cross-talk with
other pathways, TGF-b can inhibit proliferation and suppress
transformation by modulating expression of cell-cycle regulators. Alternatively, TGF-b can promote malignant growth
through multiple mechanisms including enhanced cancer
cell invasion, survival, matrix remodeling, ﬁbrosis, and
immunosuppression.
As in other epithelial cancers, TGF-b pathway function
in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) seems complex.

nents are present in approximately 50% of human PDAC and
cooperate with activated KrasG12D to promote PDAC in mouse
models (3–6). However, TGF-b ligands are commonly overexpressed in PDAC, and can promote epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and invasion in cell lines (7, 8). TGF-b can
also induce angiogenesis, activate tumor-promoting myoﬁbroblasts (stellate cells), and attenuate immune surveillance (9,
10). In light of these observations, TGF-b inhibitors are under
investigation as PDAC therapeutics and have shown efﬁcacy in
xenograft studies (11, 12).
The multifaceted and cell-type speciﬁc effects of TGF-b
inhibition present problems in fully assessing the clinical utility
of drugs against this pathway. Such effects are likely to be bestunderstood using native cancer models that appropriately
recapitulate tumor–stroma interactions as well as the multistage progression that deﬁnes human cancers. Here, we investigated the upstream regulation of TGF-b signaling in the
pancreas to establish new strategies to target the pathway,
and we examined the impact of pharmacologic inactivation of
multiple TGF-b signaling components using genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of PDAC. These studies, carried
out in the context of sequential tumor stages, different genetic
lesions, and combined treatments with cytotoxic chemotherapies, failed to reveal a therapeutic window. Instead we found
multiple settings in which disease was exacerbated by TGF-b
inhibition. This preclinical information does not presently
support the utility of broadly targeting this pathway in PDAC.

(anti-Tgf-b), 13C4 (IgG isotype control), and 3G9 (anti-avb6)
groups (13, 14). Gemcitabine was dosed at 100 mg/kg intraperitoneally (i.p.) twice weekly. Mice were treated at age 6
weeks and euthanized at 12 weeks (PanIN study) or at 9 weeks
until exhibiting signs of illness (PDAC study). In the PDAC
cohort, 4 long-lived controls were sacriﬁced and censored after
20 weeks of age when all mice in the experimental cohorts had
died. These animals were free of signs of illness but upon
pathologic evaluation were found to have advanced PanIN or
early cancers.
Histologic analysis
PanIN/PDAC tumor burden was determined by serial analysis of more than 3 H&E sections through the longitudinal
plain of the pancreas. A gastrointestinal pathologist (V. Deshpande) determined percentage of pancreas occupied by normal tissue, PanIN, and PDAC, in a blinded fashion.
Antibodies
For avb6, the mAb 6.2A1 (14) used at 1:100 in human tissue
or the human/mouse chimeric form of 6.2A1 (ch6.2A1) in
mouse tissue (15) used at 1:100; for phospho (Ser465/467)Smad2, catalog number AB3849 (Millipore Corporation); for
endothelial cells, the rat endomucin v.7C7 (Santa Cruz) used at
1:50; for pericytes, NG2 catalog number AB5320 (Chemicon)
used at 1:200; for Ki-67, NCL-Ki67p (Novocastra); for macrophages, the anti-CD68-M antibody, MCA1957T (Serotech); for
total T-cells, the anti-CD3 antibody, Catalog number RM-9107S (Lab vision/Neomarkers); for Foxp3, catalog number14-5773
(eBioscience).
Quantiﬁcation of IHC/IF
Staining for CD68, FoxP3 and phospho-Smad2 was quantiﬁed by scanning slides at 20 using the Aperio-XT automated
imaging system. Regions of interest where identiﬁed within the
tissues for quantiﬁcation of DAB positive CD68 and Foxp3
stained cells. For phospho-SMAD2 quantiﬁcation, we used an
automated algorithm to quantify the level of nuclear DAB
staining on a scale ranging from 0, þ1, þ2, and þ3. Ki-67
staining was quantiﬁed by pathologic evaluation as the percent
of neoplastic cells with positive staining.
Statistical analysis
Survival was determined using the Kaplan–Meier method
and comparisons were determined using the Log-rank test.
Animals showing signs of illness and with conﬁrmed cancers
were included as events, whereas animals that died for reasons
other than cancer were censored. Histologic scores for disease
burden, Ki67, and P-smad2 staining between treatment groups
compared using t-tests. b6 IHC scoring was compared by the
Mann–Whitney test.

Results
PDAC evolves from premalignant lesions including acinarto-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and pancreatic intraepithelial
neoplasia (PanIN; ref. 16). We evaluated the activation
status of the TGF-b pathway during PDAC progression via

immunohistochemical staining for Serine465/467-phosphorylated Smad2 (phospho-Smad2) in the Ptf1-Cre;LSL-KrasG12D;
p53L/þ (Kras-p53Lox/þ) model. Phospho-Smad2 was elevated in
ADM and early PanINs compared to normal ductal and acinar
cells, and remained at high levels throughout PDAC progression (Fig. 1A, upper panels, yellow arrowheads). Stromal ﬁbroblasts also showed strong nuclear P-Smad2 staining (Fig. 1A,
red arrowheads).
Previous studies have documented increased expression of
TGF-b ligands in PDAC progression (5). Because TGF-b is
produced as a latent complex, additional processes such as
proteolytic cleavage or conformational changes are required to
activate signaling. To determine the basis for TGF-b activation,
we examined the expression pattern of avb6, a candidate
activator of latent TGF-b that is upregulated in advanced
tumors (15, 17). In mice, avb6 was absent in islet and acinar
cells and at low to moderate levels in normal ducts, whereas
expression was increased throughout each stage of PDAC
progression (Fig. 1A, lower panels). Expression of avb6 was
restricted to transformed pancreatic ductal epithelium with no
evidence of staining in the stromal microenvironment. Human
specimens showed a similar avb6 expression proﬁle, with
staining in low- and high-grade PanIN lesions and most PDAC,
with normal human ducts showing only weak staining
(Fig. 1B). The correlation between induction of avb6 expression and phospho-Smad2 in PanIN and PDAC suggests this
integrin may be important in local activation of TGF-b signaling in ductal lesions.
To examine the relationship between avb6 function and
TGF-b signaling, we treated Kras-p53Lox/þ mice with an avb6
blocking IgG monoclonal antibody (3G9; ref. 14), a pan-TGF-b
blocking IgG monoclonal antibody, 1D11 (13), or an isotype
control antibody (13C4). Anti-avb6 treatment strongly
decreased phospho-Smad2 expression in PanIN and PDAC
lesions as well as surrounding stroma (Fig. 1C). Collectively,
our data indicate that avb6 is critical for activation of TGF-b
signaling in the neoplastic epithelium.
Targeting TGF-b signaling could limit PDAC growth by
blocking TGF-b-mediated protumorigenic effects on the
microenvironment and on the invasiveness of cancer cells.
Moreover, avb6 inhibition could serve to inactivate TGF-b
signaling in a restricted manner, limiting the effects of a
pharmacologic blockade to the diseased pancreas. To test
these possibilities, we used the anti-TGF-b, anti-avb6, and
isotype control antibodies in the Kras-p53Lox/þ model. To
evaluate the impact of treatments on progression of preinvasive lesions antibodies were administered at 5 weeks of age—
when the pancreas is largely normal but contains focal early
stage PanINs (schematic in Fig. 2A). Pancreases were evaluated
for the presence of gross tumors and by correlative histologic
and immunohistochemical analysis at 12 weeks. Anti-avb6
treated animals had increases in the proportion of the pancreas
exhibiting PanIN or PDAC lesions compared with controls
(mean ¼ 73% in 3G9 vs. 45% control; P ¼ 0.04; Fig. 2B, upper
row), as well as a higher frequency of invasive PDAC (66%, vs.
33% in controls). Comparable increases in neoplasia were
observed in anti-Tgf-b–treated mice. Therefore, blocking avb6
accelerated the course of PanIN initiation and progression,

disease stages. Kras-p53Lox/þ mice were treated beginning at 9
to 10 weeks of age, when either high grade PanINs (PanIN-3) or
locally invasive PDAC were present (schema in Fig. 2C, upper).
Mice were treated until signs of illness necessitated euthanasia.
Notably, overall survival was signiﬁcantly diminished in the
anti-TGF-b and anti-avb6 groups demonstrating a persistent
role for TGF-b in suppressing growth at later stages of disease
(Fig. 2C, lower left). Histopathologic analysis revealed treated
tumors to be invasive PDAC showing a range of histologic
differentiation. Blocking antibodies did not produce signiﬁcant
differences in the spectrum of tumor grade and histologic
subtypes (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B).
The PDAC stroma is a potential barrier to effective delivery
of chemotherapeutic agents to tumor cells (18). Based on the
potential function of TGF-b signaling in activating stromal
ﬁbroblasts, we tested whether TGF-b blockade inﬂuenced the
response of the Kras-p53Lox/þ model to gemcitabine, a standard chemotherapy. The addition of avb6 or TGF-b blocking
antibodies to standard gemcitabine treatment led to a diminished survival as compared with gemcitabine alone (Fig. 2C,

leading to a larger burden of disease and more advanced
tumors.
Acceleration in progression of PanIN lesions among antiTgf-b and anti-avb6–treated mice was associated with an
increase in proliferation as reﬂected by Ki67 staining
(Fig. 2B, lower row). Consistent with this we observed that
4/5 primary pancreatic ductal cell cultures with activated Kras
showed growth inhibition in responses to TGF-b treatments.
We failed to observe signiﬁcant alterations in stromal components that can be activated by TGF-b, including the stellate
cells (smooth muscle actin), Tregs (FoxP3), macrophages
(CD68), the desmoplastic stroma (qRT-PCR analysis for collagen-1) and vasculature (endomucin and NG2; Supplementary
Fig. S1A–C). Thus, these data indicate that the avb6-TGF-b
pathway has a primary role in restraining proliferation and
malignant progression of PanIN epithelial cells.
Because both TGF-b and avb6 signaling have been implicated in the induction of EMT and invasive growth of established cancers, we next sought to test whether the anti-TGF-b
and anti-avb6 antibodies had a differential impact at later

on the neoplastic epithelium; potential positive roles of avb6
and TGF-b in stromal regulation may have a less prominent
impact on tumorigenesis.
Our work shows that avb6 is a critical component of
the TGF-b-Smad4 tumor suppressor pathway in PDAC. Correspondingly, reduced avb6 expression could serve as an

alternative mechanism to SMAD4 mutations as a means to
inactivate the TGF-b pathway during PDAC progression. To
examine this question, we carried out IHC analysis across a set
of PDAC specimens derived from Smad4 wild type and Smad4
null mouse models using antibodies to avb6. Although all the
tumors with Smad4 mutations expressed avb6 at higher levels
in invasive tumors compared with PanINs, we found that
approximately 26% of Smad4 wild-type tumors lost avb6

expression (Fig. 3A). Importantly, the absence of avb6 staining
correlated with SMAD4 status (P ¼ 0.01). The spontaneous loss
of expression of avb6 among Smad4 wild-type tumors, but
never in combination with Smad4 mutation, supports the view
that avb6 is a central activator of the TGF-b-SMAD4 tumor
suppressor pathway, and suggests that molecular alterations of
both upstream and downstream components promote PDAC
tumorigenesis.
To test more directly whether avb6 acts in a common TGFb/Smad4 tumor suppressor pathway, we assessed the impact
of 3G9 on a Kras-driven PDAC model that also has an engineered homozygous deletion of Smad4 and therefore has
defective TGF-b signaling in the pancreatic epithelial cells
(5). Treatment was started at the time when focal PDAC is
present, and maintained until signs of illness required euthanasia. In contrast to their effects in the Smad4 wild-type Krasp53Lox/þ model, avb6 blocking antibodies did not alter the
latency or histopathologic features of Smad4 null tumors (Fig.
3B). Therefore, genetic inactivation of TGF-b signaling obviates
the effect of avb6 blockade on tumorigenesis, consistent with a
predominant action of the blocking antibodies in inhibiting
epithelial TGF-b-Smad4 signaling.

risks in broadly targeting this pathway given its primary
function as a tumor suppressor.
Recent ﬁndings have supported the ability of GEM models
to recapitulate therapeutic responses seen in patients (19).
Our experiments illustrate a number of potential advantages
of GEM models, such as the capacity to evaluate the impact
of an intervention at different disease stages including
preinvasive disease, and in deﬁned tumor genotypes. Whereas preclinical studies in xenografts have supported the use of
TGF-b pathway inhibitors in the treatment of PDAC, our
work indicates this strategy carries risk in the context of
autochthonous tumors.
It remains possible that there may be contexts in which
inhibition of components of the avb6-TGF-b pathway may
prove beneﬁcial in PDAC treatment. Both avb6 and TGF-b
have been implicated in metastasis, which we were not able to
address deﬁnitively in our studies (1/7 controls and 1/15
treated mice exhibited metastasis, which was insufﬁcient to
provide statistical signiﬁcance). In addition, while direct targeting of avb6 or TGF-b may carry risks, it is possible that
signaling receptors or downstream effectors of the pathway
have strictly tumor-promoting effects, and thus may be effective targets for pharmacologic blockade. Along these lines a
recent study showed TGF-b activates CxC chemokine signaling
in a PDAC GEM model and that inhibition delays tumor
progression (20).
Our studies also reveal new insights into the mechanisms of
TGF-b activation in the pancreas and the contributions of this
pathway in multistage PDAC progression. We show that global
inactivation of TGF-b signaling promotes increased proliferation of the PanIN epithelial cells and enhances PDAC initiation and progression in a Smad4-dependant manner.
Although TGF-b likely has additional functions in regulating
the PDAC microenvironment, these functions do not seem
essential for either the tumor promotion or tumor suppression.

Discussion
Here, we show that TGF-b pathway blockade with speciﬁc
monoclonal antibodies to avb6 or TGF-b1-3 accelerated PDAC
progression in GEM models. This effect was observed when
using antibodies at early and later disease stages, and as a
single agent or in combination with gemcitabine. Although
tumorigenesis was not accelerated in a GEM model lacking
Smad4, avb6/TGF-b inhibition did not provide any appreciable beneﬁt in this setting. Although it is possible that avb6/
TGF-b pathway inhibition may restrain aspects of malignancy
such as metastatic spread, our data indicate that there may be

TGF-b Inhibition Accelerates Pancreatic Cancer Progression

We also identify avb6 as a critical upstream regulator of TGF-b
signaling in the ductal epithelium and show that avb6 has a
previously unanticipated function in tumor suppression. avb6
blockade attenuated Smad2 activation, produced similar biological effects to TGF-b blockade in our mouse models, and did
not affect the progression of Smad4 null tumors. Thus,
although avb6 has been shown to promote invasive growth
of advanced cancers, our data indicate that the primary
function of avb6 in the pancreas is to serve as an upstream
component of the TGF-b tumor suppression program. It is
worth noting that PDAC in the Kras-Smad4 model arise from
cystic precursors rather than PanIN (3, 5), which could also
contribute to the differential response to pathway inhibition in
this setting.
In summary, this series of experiments highlight the use of
GEM cancer models to guide in the clinical development of
novel therapeutics and to elucidate signaling pathway circuitry
in vivo. We show that avb6 and TGF-b act in a common Smad4dependent PDAC tumor suppressor pathway. Moreover, we
conclude that broad use of TGF-b inhibitors in unselected
populations of PDAC patients could have detrimental consequences, and in particular, that there is potential for disease
acceleration in cancers with an intact TGF-b/SMAD4 signaling
pathway.
