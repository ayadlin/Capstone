ABSTRACT
In the present study, we demonstrated that the levels of DKK1 were decreased
in serums and tissues of GC. DKK1 levels inversely correlated with tumor class, TNM
stage, distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis of GC. GC patients with low
DKK1 levels had a poor overall survival. DKK1 inhibited the proliferation of GC cells
in vitro and in vivo. DKK1 also inhibited invasion, but enhanced chemo-sensitivity of
GC cells. Mechanically, miR-493 levels increased in GC and directly targeted and downregulated DKK1 expression. In agreement, miR-493 promoted proliferation of GC
cells in vitro and in vivo. MiR-493 also promoted invasion and chemo-resistance of GC
cells. However, DKK1 overexpression reversed the effects of miR-493 on proliferation,
invasion and chemo-sensitivity. Thus, our results provide new insight for the role of
miR-493/DKK1 axis in GC.

INTRODUCTION

demonstrated in a colon cancer model, and epigenetic
silence of DKK1 has been reported in colorectal cancers
[14]. In regard to roles of DKK1 in GC, there are also
converse reports. Report from Gao et al. showed that
DKK1 was overexpressed in GC[15], but investigation
from Cai et al. demonstrated that DKK1 could reduce the
self-renewal capacity of cancer stem-like cells in GC via
blocking the wnt/β-catenin signal [16]. Thus, it is urgent
to clarify the role of DKK1 in GC and the mechanisms for
DKK1 deregulation.
Cancer tissue samples are the best for evaluating
cancer markers, but blood samples are more readily available
and require a relatively noninvasive procedure. Recently, an
increased DKK1 serum level has been reported to be useful
as a cancer biomarker in lung, esophageal, cervical, and
endometrial cancers [17, 18]. However, these findings about
the serum levels of DKK1 were still controversial. Serum
DKK1 was found to be elevated in cancer types such as
HCC, breast cancer with bone metastasis and cervical cancer
[19–21]. In contrast, serum DKK1 was also reported to be
significantly lower in cancers, such as in multiple myeloma
responding to anti-myeloma treatment [22], clear cell renal

Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most common
malignant disease worldwide and the secondly main
cause of death from cancer [1]. There was an incidence
of 989,000 cases and a mortality of 735,000 cases for GC
in 2011 [2, 3]. In spite of advances in developing more
efficient surgical techniques and novel chemotherapeutic
interventions, the long term survival rate of GC patients
remains poor. Chemo-resistance and invasion are still the
major obstacles for successful GC treatment. The precise
mechanisms for progression in GC remain elusive.
Dickkopf-1 (DKK1), a secreted protein, usually is
reported to interact with the LRP5/LRP6 co-receptor, to
inhibit the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling [4, 5]. DKK1
plays a diverse roles in different cancers [6]. Some reports
discovered that DKK1 was overexpressed in multiple
myeloma, hepatoblastomas, Wilms’ tumors, breast cancer
and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and functioned as a
tumor promoter [7–10]. On the other hand, several studies
supported that DKK1 suppressed tumors growth [11–13].

indicated that DKK1 should further be stud­ied to distinct its
roles in cancers. The mechanisms for DKK1 deregulation
also remains to be elusive.
In this study, we found that DKK1 expression was
markedly decreased in GC tissues and serum samples.
DKK1 expression inversely correlated with miR-493 levels
and is a direct target of miR-493. Moreover, miR-493
modulated the proliferation, invasion and chemosensitivity of GC cells via suppressing DKK1 expression.

could remarkably impair the proliferation potential of
SGC-7901 cells comparing to the control treated cells,
while the opposite results were got in MGC-803 cells after
DKK1 knockdown with psi-LVRU6GP-shDKK1 plasmid
against DKK1 (Figure 2B). Moreover, the effect of DKK1
on growth in GC cells was further examined in nude mice
with GC xenografts. We injected subcutaneously into
the oxter of Athymic mice with DKK1 overexpressing
SGC-7901 cells and their control cells. As shown, tumors
derived from DKK1 overexpressing SGC-7901 cells had
a significantly reduced tumor size compared with related
control cells (Figure 2C). Additionally, both DKK1
treatment and DKK1 overexpression led to a robustly
invasion inhibition in SGC-7901 cells, but DKK1
knockdown enhanced the invasion potential of MGC-803
cells (Figure 2D). As shown in Figure 2E, both DKK1
treatment and DKK1 overexpression sensitized SGC7901 cells to cDDP, whereas, DKK1 knockdown enhanced
chemo-resistance of MGC-803 cells to cDDP. In view of
these data, we proposed that DKK1 might be involved in
proliferation, invasion and chemo-sensitivity of GC cells.

RESULTS
DKK1 levels decreased in GC, and associates
with prognosis of GC patients
To explore the potential role of DKK1 in GC, we
first detected its expression pattern in GC serum. As shown
in Figure 1A, the DKK1 protein level in GC serum was
significantly reduced comparing with normal control. In
the 116 GC patients, the DKK1 level inversely correlated
with clinical parameters, such as tumor class, TNM stage,
distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis, but not
the histological grade (Figure 1A, Table 1). Meanwhile,
we conducted immunohistochemistry to evaluate DKK1
protein level in 34 cases of normal and 132 cases of GC
tissues. The GC tissues were separated into two cohorts.
For cohort one, 52 tissues were obtained from GC patients
also enrolled for their DKK1 serum concentrations.
The results indicated that DKK1 expression was downregulated in 82.7% GC tissues, which was in accordance
with that in serum (Figure 1B). For cohort two, 80 GC
tissues were got with follow-up information. We found
DKK1 was down-regulated in 78.8% GC tissues compared
with normal tissues in cohort two (Figure 1B). To assess
the significance of DKK1 in terms of clinical prognosis,
Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was conducted among
the 80 GC tissues. The results showed that patients with
low DKK1 expression had a poorer overall survival than
the patients with high DKK1 expression in cohort two
(Figure 1B). Additionally, DKK1 expression level in GC
cells was determined by real-time RT-PCR and western
blot. It was indicated that DKK1 is relatively highly
expressed in MGC-803 cell with low-invasive ability,
and is lowly expressed in high-invasive GC cell line
SGC-7901 (Figure 1C). These results demonstrated that
DKK1 is down-regulated in GC and its down-regulation
negatively correlated with prognosis.

miR-493 suppresses DKK1 expression in GC cells
To explore the mechanism for DKK1 downregulation, here, potential miRNAs targeting DKK1
were predicted with online software microRNA.org and
TargetScan, respectively (Figure 3A). To investigate
whether miR-493 directly targets DKK1, we found increased
miR-493 via transfection of miR-493 expressing plasmid
pEZX-miR-493 significantly down-regulated DKK1
mRNA and protein levels in MGC-803 cells (Figure 3B).
Meanwhile, miR-493 inhibitor clearly up-regulated
DKK1 mRNA and protein levels in SGC-7901 cells
(Figure 3B). Furthermore, we constructed luciferase
reporter vectors with the putative DKK1 3′-UTR target
site for miR-493 at downstream of the luciferase gene
(pMir-DKK1-wt, set as wild-type) and mutant version with
deletion of 7bp in the seed sequence (pMir-DKK1-mut).
Results of reporter gene assays demonstrated that miR-493
overexpression observably decreased luciferase activity of
pMir-DKK1-wt vector, but the mutant version abrogated
the suppressive ability of miR-493 overexpression in
MGC-803 cells (Figure 3C). Inversely, miR-493 inhibitor
evidently enhanced luciferase activity of pMir-DKK1-wt
vector, and the mutant version abrogated the promotive
effect of miR-493 inhibitor in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 3C).
These findings strongly suggested that DKK1 is a novel
direct target of miR-493 in GC cells.

normal control group (Figure 4A). Correlation analysis
showed that DKK1 level inversely correlated with
miR-493 level in GC serum (Figure 4A). In the 116 serum
samples of GC patients, miR-493 level was positively
correlated with clinical parameters, such as tumor class,
TNM stage, distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis,
but not histological grade (Figure 4A). As shown in
Figure 4B, miR-493 was highly expressed in SGC-7901
cell line with high-invasive ability but lowly expressed
in low-invasive GC cell line MGC-803. Additionally,
we found miR-493 overexpression promoted the cell
proliferation, and miR-493 functional inhibition got a
contrary result (Figure 4C). Importantly, the effect of miR493 on growth in GC cells was further examined in nude
mice with GC xenografts. We injected subcutaneously into
the oxter of Athymic mice with miR-493 overexpressing
MGC-803 cells and their control cells. As shown, tumors
derived from miR-493 overexpressing MGC-803 cells had
a significantly increased tumor size compared with related
control cells (Figure 4D). Similarly, transwell assay
showed that miR-493 markedly enhanced the invasion of
GC cells (Figure 4E). Furthermore, we found miR-493
decreased the chemo-sensitivity of GC cells to cDDP,
and miR-493 inhibitor enhanced the chemo-sensitivity
(Figure 4F). Collectively, these data indicated that
miR-493 is highly expressed in GC, and promotes the
proliferation, invasion and chemo-resistance of GC cells.

To investigate whether the tumor promotive effect of
miR-493 was mediated by repressing DKK1 expression,
we explored the rescue function of DKK1 in GC cells with
different level of miR-493. Here, our findings indicated
that DKK1 could reverse the promotive effect of miR-493
on proliferation in MGC-803 cells, but DKK1 knockdown
could abrogate the suppressive effect of miR-493
inhibitor on proliferation in SGC-7901 cells (Figure 5A).
Additionally, ectopic DKK1 expression impaired the
promotive effect of miR-493 on tumor growth of MGC-803
in vivo (Figure 5B). Moreover, DKK1 also inhibit the
invasive potential mediated by miR-493 in GC cells
(Figure 5C). As shown in Figure 5D, overexpressed DKK1
reversed the chemo-resistance induced by miR-493 in GC
cells. These results suggested miR-493 acts as a tumor
promoter in GC via modulating DKK1 expression.

DISCUSSION
Most GC patients present with locally advanced
or metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis and
experience resistance to anticancer therapy and poor
overall prognosis. Thus, there is urgent need to elucidate
the precise molecular mechanisms involved in growth,
invasion, metastasis and chemo-resistance of GC

for improving current treatments in the clinic. In the
present study, DKK1 expression in GC was decreased
and inversely correlated with miR-493 expression.
Bioinformatics analysis combined with experimental
validation revealed that DKK1 is a novel direct target of
miR-493 in GC cells. MiR-493 promotes GC progression
via suppressing DKK1 expression.
DKK1 had been reported to be highly expressed in
several cancers and negatively correlated with prognosis.
It had been demonstrated that elevated DKK1 expression
was an early event in prostate cancer (PCa), but during
PCa progression, DKK1 expression declined, particularly
in advanced bone metastases. High DKK1 expression
within PCa metastasis was further associated with
shorter overall survival [24]. It was also characterized
that high DKK1 serum levels were associated with a
poor survival in patients with PCa [25]. The significance
of DKK1 as a serum protein marker for HCC and nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been investigated
[26, 27]. In apparent contradiction to the reports stated

above, DKK1 expression was showed to be decreased in
multiple cancers, including cancer types from stomach,
colon, ovary and kidney [17, 23]. The serum DKK1
levels were lower in NSCLC and SCLC patients without
any treatment, but after surgery and/or chemotherapy
treatment, DKK1 expression level elevated [28]. So,
DKK1 levels increased in serum from cancer patients
whether resulted from treatment interferences remain
unclear. In this study, we found the DKK1 levels in serum
and tissues from GC patients without any treatment were
decreased. DKK1 expression was negatively related
with clinical parameters, such as tumor class, TNM
stage, distant metastasis and lymph node metastasis, but
positively related with prognosis. We also found cDDP
could up-regulate DKK1 expression in GC cells (data was
not shown), together with the evidence provided by Xu
et al. [28], we proposed that surgery and/or chemotherapy
treatment would increase DKK1 expression in vivo and
vitro. For further study, DKK1 level in GC patients before
and after treatment should be analyzed.

In regard to mechanisms for DKK1 down-regulation
in GC, we focused on microRNAs (miRNAs). MiRNAs
are a class of endogenous, non-coding single-strand small
molecular RNAs. MiRNAs have been involved in many
cellular processes, such as proliferation, differentiation,
apoptosis and so on. MiRNAs induce posttranscriptional
gene silencing by tethering RISC (RNA-induced silencing
complex) to partly complementary sequence motifs in the
3′UTR of target mRNAs [29, 30]. Increasing evidences
suggested that miRNAs were abnormally expressed in
many kinds of cancers, functioning as oncogenes or tumor
suppressors [31]. Previous work has demonstrated that
miR-493 functions as a tumor suppressor. It was found
that miR-493 expression decreased in bladder cancer and
overexpressed miR-493 suppressed bladder cancer cells
motility through down-regulation of RhoC and FZD4
[32]. Through dropout screening in a mouse model of liver
metastasis, it was demonstrated that miR-493 induced cell
death of metastasized cells, and inhibited liver metastasis of
colon cancer cells by directly targeting IGFIR [33]. Gu et al.
found that the expression of miR-493 was markedly reduced
in pulmonary carcinoma and ectopic expression of miR-493
impaired cell growth and invasion in vitro and vivo through
directly targeted E2F1 [34]. But the opposite results were
detected in GC here. We found that the serum level of miR493 was up-regulated in GC patients, which was inversely
correlated with DKK1 level. Bioinformatics analysis
together with luciferase reporter assay proved that miR-493
targeted DKK1 through directly binding to its 3′UTR. MiR493 functioned as tumor promoter in GC via targeting DKK1
expression. Whether miR-493 exerts its role in cancer with
cell-context dependence should be further explored.
Summary, we here demonstrated that DKK1 acted
as a tumor suppressor in GC, and its expression level
was correlated with GC prognosis. Meanwhile, miR493 played an oncogenic role in GC by directly targeting
DKK1. Our results provide new insight into the role of
miR-493/DKK1 signaling pathway in GC progression and
suggest potential molecular target for the treatment of GC.

obtained from the patients whose serum DKK1 level
had been determined. For the second cohort, additional
80 patients with consecutive GC from Cancer Center of
Guangzhou Medical University were enrolled in the study
to undergo immunohistochemistry and long-term survival
analysis. Follow-up information, including overall
survival was also collected. The study was approved by
the ethics committee of Cancer Center of Guangzhou
Medical University.

Cell culture
GC cell lines SGC-7901, MKN28, AGS and
MGC-803 were all obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection. Cells were cultured in RPMI-1640
(Life Technologies) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Life
Technologies) in a humidified cell incubator with an
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37°C.

RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR
Total RNA was isolated from treated cells
using TRIzol Reagent (Life Technologies), and then
RervertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Ferments
Life Science) was used to synthesize cDNA. Real-time
RT-PCR for DKK1 detection was performed using SYBR
Select Master Mix (Life Technologies) following the
manufactory instruction. GAPDH was used as an internal
control. The primers for GAPDH were: forward primer
5′-ATTCCATGGCACCGTCAAGGCTGA-3′, reverse
primer 5′-TTCTCCATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCA-3′;
for DKK1 were: forward primer 5′- CCTTGAACTC

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Clinical specimens
116 cases of GC patients’ serum specimens without
surgery and/or chemotherapy treatment, and 30 cases of
normal patients’ serum specimens were collected from
Cancer Center of Guangzhou Medical University. The
blood samples were centrifuged 10 min, 800 g at 4°C, then
the supernatant was transferred into a new tube, and the
serum was frozen at −80°C until use. All data, including
histological grade, tumor class, TNM stage, distant
metastasis and lymph node metastasis were obtained from
clinical and pathologic records. The GC tissue samples
were collected from two separate cohorts. For the first
cohort, 52 cases of matching GC tissue samples were

accordance with the manufacturer’s procedure. Related
stable cell lines were selected with puromycin treatment.
The miR-493 inhibitor and control (Exiqon) with a final
concentration of 100 nM were also transfected with
Lipofectamine 2000. For proliferation assay, the miR-493
inhibitor and control were transfected every 3 days. The

well. Approximately 48 h after treatment, 20 μL MTS
(promega) was added into each well, and the plate was
incubated at 37°C for 4 h. The absorbance at 490 nm
of each well was recorded by microplate reader BioTek
Synergy 2. Growth rate was calculated as the ratio
of the absorbance of the experimental well to that of
the control.

Transwell assay

Luciferase reporter assay

Invasion of cells was evaluated with the Cell Invasion
Assay Kit (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer’s
instructions. Briefly, at 36 h post-transfection, 3 × 104 cells
in 300 μL serum-free medium were added to the upper
chamber precoated with ECMatrix™ gel. And 0.5 mL
medium with 10% FBS was added to the lower chamber
as a chemoattractant. Subsequently, cells were incubated
at 37°C for 24 h. Furthermore, non-invading cells were
removed with cotton swabs. In addition, cells that migrated
to the bottom of the membrane were fixed with pre-cold
methanol and stained with 2% Giemsa solution. Finally,
Stained cells were visualized under a microscope. To
minimize the bias, at least three randomly selected fields
with 100 × magnification were counted, and the average
number was taken.

The DNA sequences with each 50 base at up-and
downstream of miR-493 binding site in the 3′UTR of
DKK1 (as wild-type version) and DNA sequences with
7 bases deleted in the miR-493 binding site (as mutant
version), were synthesized with restriction sites for SpeI
and HindIII located at both ends of the oligonucleotides for
further cloning, and subsequently cloned into pMir-Report
plasmid downstream of firefly luciferase reporter gene.
Cells were seeded in 96 well-plates and co-transfected with
pMir-Report luciferase vector, pRL-TK Renilla luciferase
vector and pEZX-miR-493 or miR-493 inhibitor using
Lipofectamine 2000. After transfection of 48 h, luciferase
activity was determined using a Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay System (Promega) on the BioTek Synergy 2. The
Renilla luciferase activity was used as internal control and
the firefly luciferase activity was calculated as the mean
± SD after being normalized by Renilla luciferase activity.

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
The serum concentration of DKK1 was measured
by Human DKK1 Quantikine ELISA Kit (R & D system)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
100 μL Assay Diluent was added into each well, followed
by 100 μL standard, control or sample and the microplate
was incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Then each
well was washed 3 times, blocked with 200 μL Conjugate
and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed
by another washing step. In addition, 200 μL Substrate
Solution was added and incubated at 37°C for 30 mins
without light. Finally, the reaction was terminated by
adding 50 μL Stop Solution. The absorbance was read at
a 450 nm wavelength. The concentration of DKK1 was
evaluated based on standard curves.

Western blot
Total protein was harvested by RIPA lysis buffer
(Pierce) with Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Pierce), and
quantified using the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). These
protein was separated by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred
onto PVDF membrane (Millipore), blocked with Tris
buffer contained 0.1% Tween-20 and 5% nonfat milk at
4°C. The membranes were incubated with anti-DKK1
(Novus Biologicals, 1:2000 dilution; anti-GAPDH,
Santa Cruz biotechnology, 1:500), and followed by
HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Merk, 1:5000),
respectively. The signal was detected using ECL detection
system (Millipore) as described by the manufacturer.

Immunohistochemistry

Proliferation assay

All tissue samples were embedded in paraffin,
and immunostained with DKK1 antibody after a
microwave antigen retrieval procedure was performed.
Furthermore, samples were orderly incubated with biotin
labeled secondary antibody, DAB detection system and
hematoxylin. In addition, the extent of the staining was
visually evaluated on a scale of 1 (no staining) to 4 (strong
staining). Approximately 800 cells were evaluated for each
sample by two observers, and the mean value for each
staining was calculated. Clinical samples were divided
into high-expression or low-expression groups based on
DKK1 expression scores.

Related cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a
density of 1000 cells per well. Every two day, the cells
number of independent three wells was counted, and the
average number was calculated. The cell proliferation
assay was performed on 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 days, the
average cell number of each time point was noted.

MTS assay
Cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and
different concentration of cDDP was added into each

All data was presented as means ± standard
deviation from three independent experiments. SPSS19.0
software was used to carry out statistical analysis. The
differences between groups were investigated by student’s
t-test with only two groups or one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) when more than two groups were compared.
P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
