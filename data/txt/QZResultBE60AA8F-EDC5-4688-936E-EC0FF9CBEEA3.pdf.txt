Abstract

Author Manuscript

SOX11 (Sex determining region Y-box 11) expression is specific for MCL as compared to other
Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. However, the function and direct binding targets of SOX11 in MCL
are largely unknown. We used high-resolution ChIP-Seq to identify the direct target genes of
SOX11 in a genome-wide, unbiased manner and elucidate its functional significance. Pathway
analysis identified WNT, PKA and TGF-beta signaling pathways as significantly enriched by
SOX11 target genes. qCHIP and promoter reporter assays confirmed that SOX11 directly binds to
individual genes and modulates their transcription activities in these pathways in MCL. Functional
studies using RNA interference demonstrate that SOX11 directly regulates WNT in MCL. We
analyzed SOX11 expression in three independent well-annotated tissue microarrays from the
University of Wisconsin (UW), Karolinska Institute and British Columbia Cancer Agency
(BCCA). Our findings suggest that high SOX11 expression is associated with improved survival
in a subset of MCL patients, particularly those treated with intensive chemotherapy.
Transcriptional regulation of WNT and other biological pathways affected by SOX11 target genes
may help explain the impact of SOX11 expression on patient outcomes.

Introduction

Author Manuscript

MCL (Mantle Cell Lymphoma) represents approximately 6 percent of all non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma (NHL), which is the commonest hematological malignancy worldwide. Despite
advances in chemotherapy and immunotherapy, the majority of MCL patients relapses and
dies of their disease, and advances in prognostication and therapeutics are urgently needed
(1). The pathogenesis of MCL is characterized by cell cycle dysregulation and CCND1
(Cyclin D1) overexpression. However, CCND1 overexpression is not universal in this
disease and mouse models overexpressing CCND1 do not recapitulate the phenotype of the
disease (2), indicating that additional genetic lesions are therefore necessary for
lymphomagenesis and in need of characterization.
SOX11 (Sex determining region Y)-box 11 immuno-histochemical expression is present in
the majority (78-93%) of MCL patients and is specific for MCL as compared to other nonHodgkin's lymphomas (3-5). SOX11 belongs to the SOXC family of high mobility group
(HMG) transcription factors, which consists of SOX4, SOX11 and SOX12 (6). HMG
transcription factors bind to, and facilitate conformational changes in DNA, that allow

binding of other transcription factors to regulate downstream gene expression. SOXC
transcription factors have overlapping roles in nervous system development and it is likely
that these factors may play a role in B cell development as well, as SOX11-null mice do not
form spleens and SOX4 deficient mice do not form B lymphocytes (6-7). Although SOX11
expression has been demonstrated in the majority of patients with MCL, data on its
functional role in MCL pathogenesis are lacking. Gene expression arrays have been used to
compare the transcriptional profiles of SOX11 transfected MCL cell lines to infer the genes
regulated by SOX11 (8). However, this approach is limited by two aspects (a) Gene
expression changes by SOX11 modulation may be indirect and not reflective of the direct
binding targets of this gene; (b) Expression microarrays are limited by vendor – specific
variation in coverage of human genome depending on array design. Next-generation
sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipition (ChIP) products can identify direct binding
targets in an unbiased and genome-wide manner. We therefore performed Chip-seq
(chromatin immunoprecipition coupled with massive parallel sequencing) using the MCL
cell line Granta-519 as a model to identify SOX11 direct binding targets, which were then
validated in MCL patients and cell lines. Based on our cell line data, we hypothesized that
SOX11 negatively regulates cell proliferation in vivo and its expression may be associated
with differences in chemotherapy sensitivity and survival in MCL. Prior studies examining
the impact of SOX11 expression on patient outcomes have been hampered by small numbers
and treatment heterogeneity. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of three wellannotated cohorts of patient samples to examine the association of SOX11 with patient
outcomes and the impact of treatment on this association.

1. High resolution ChIP-sequencing identifies SOX11 binding targets in critical cellular
pathways regulating proliferation in MCL cell lines and patients

Author Manuscript

Genomic DNA from the Granta-519 MCL cell line was immunoprecipitated by SOX11
antibody and IgG and genomic enrichment sites were sequenced by Illumina Hiseq2000
system. Using stringent statistical criteria (p-value less than 0.01, fold change more than 1.5)
we identified significant enrichment of ChIP-seq peaks (Supplementary Table S1-S2)
corresponding to 1912 unique genes common in both replicates (Supplementary Table S3).
Figure 1A showed the genomic distribution of genomic DNA fragments directly bound by
SOX11. The most common motifs enriched in the SOX11-binding targets contained the core
(T/A)TTGT sequence (Figure 1B) bound by highly related members of the SOX family of
transcription factors (9, 10). KEGG Pathway analysis of SOX11 binding targets revealed the
most significant network to be “Pathways in cancer” (p<10−12) which were enriched in
WNT and TGF-beta (Transforming growth factor, beta) pathway genes (Figure 1C,
Supplementary Figure S1A). We validated direct binding of SOX11 to SMAD3, TGFBR1
(Transforming growth factor, beta receptor 1), WNT4, NLK (Nemo-like kinase) and
PRKACA (Protein Kinase A catalytic unit alpha) from these pathways as well as known
SOX11 target SETMAR (SET domain and mariner transposase fusion gene), DBN1
(Drebrin 1) and HIG2 (Hypoxia-Inducible Protein 2) (8) by quantitative PCR of ChIP
products from Granta-519, Z138 and JEKO-1 (Figure 1D, Supplementary Figure S1B-C).

2. SOX11 directly binds to and transcriptionally regulates genes in the WNT signaling
pathway in MCL

Author Manuscript
Author Manuscript

Pathway analysis of Chip-seq data identified several SOX11 binding targets in the WNT
pathway (Figure 2A, marked in red). Among these SOX11 binding targets in the WNT
pathway, NLK and SMAD3 are of particular interest for their roles in regulating the WNT
pathway. NLK, a SOX11 direct binding gene, is a negative regulator of WNT signaling
pathway and has been shown to down-regulate the β-catenin/T cell factor/Lymphoid
enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF) transcription activity via phosphorylation of TCF4 to prevent
DNA binding of the β-catenin/TCF4 complexes (11). SMAD3 is a key mediator between the
TGFβ pathway and the WNT pathway (12) and plays an important role in activating WNT/
β-catenin pathway by protecting β-catenin from ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent
degradation and mediating its nuclear translocation (13). We validated the enrichment of
NLK and SMAD3 (Figure 2C, 2B) in MCL cell lines and patients by ChIP coupled with
quantitative PCR (qChIP). qChIP shows significant enrichment of SOX11binding compared
to IgG control in both primary MCL samples and MCL cell lines (Figure 2C, 2B).
Additional qChIP validation of SOX11 binding targets of WNT pathway members, WNT4
and PRKACA, is also included in supplementary figures (Supplementary Figure S2A-S2B).
We further studied the effects of SOX11 binding to its target genes via reporter assays using
promoter constructs of SMAD3 and NLK (Figure 2D-E), which contain a SOX11 consensus
binding sequence upstream of the transcription starting site. SOX11 binding to the reporter
constructs modulates the transcription of the reporter genes (Firefly luciferase in SMAD3
reporter construct and mCherry in NLK reporter construct) and thus the protein level of the
reporter genes. The reporter assays showed that overexpression of SOX11 specifically
increases NLK promoter activity by 6-12 times while decreasing SMAD3 promoter activity
by 1.8-3.5 times as compared to control plasmid in two MCL cell lines, Z138 and
Granta-519. Taken together, our data supports direct binding and transcriptional regulation
of WNT pathway members by SOX11 and demonstrated that SOX11 can exerts both
transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression functions in a gene-specific manner.
3. SOX11 functionally represses WNT/β-catenin activity in MCL cell lines

Author Manuscript

Next, we studied SOX11-mediated regulation of gene transcription by examining genes
differentially expressed following SOX11 depletion in 3 MCL cell lines, Granta-519, Z138
and JEKO-1 using RNA-sequencing. Poly-A containing mRNA from both control
(untransfected) cells and SOX11-depleted cells (48 hours after siRNA transfection) were
used for cDNA library construction. Comparing the differences in expression between
SOX11-depleted and control samples on a gene-by-gene basis and then ranking them on the
basis of a one-sample t-test of the paired, we obtained 2799 differentially-expressed genes
(Supplementary Table S4). Eleven genes in the WNT pathway were differentially expressed
across all three cell lines after SOX11 depletion (Figure 3A). Down-regulation of negative
regulators of WNT signaling pathway such as CHD8 (chromodomain helicase DNA binding
protein 8) (14), GSK3B (Glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta) (15), CUL1 (Cullin-1) (16), and
CACYBP (calcyclin binding protein) (17), were seen simultaneously with up-regulation of
SMAD3, which has been shown to stabilize and to assist in β-catenin nuclear translocation
(13) after SOX11 depletion. These expression changes suggest that SOX11 represses WNT
signaling.

To confirm the functional impacts of SOX11 on WNT signaling, we depleted SOX11 levels
by siRNA and directly examined TCF/LEF activity using a reporter assay in MCL cell lines
Granta-519 and Z138. Treatment of cells with anti-SOX11 siRNA resulted in significant
increase (p<0.04) in WNT activity (Figure 3B) compared to control non-silencing siRNA.
Conversely, overexpression of SOX11 (Figure 3D) resulted in decreased WNT signaling
(p<0.008). Reduction of SOX11 and overexpression of SOX11 at the same time point (24hr
for both SOX11 depletion and Sox11 overexpression) were confirmed at the protein level by
western blotting (Figure 3C, 3E). Taken together, these observations confirm that SOX11
represses WNT pathway in MCL.
4. SOX11 overexpression induced G2/M accumulation and repression of cell proliferation
in MCL

Author Manuscript

Previous studies have shown constitutive activation of the WNT pathway in primary MCL
and identify WNT pathway as important targets for regulating cell proliferation in MCL cell
lines in vitro (18, 19). To test whether SOX11-mediated WNT pathway repression can
functionally repress cell proliferation, we transfected SOX11 using a CMV-driven SOX11IRES-eGFP expressing plasmid into Granta-519 cells and measured proliferation by tracing
cell division in living cells using the Celltrace™ Violet Cell Proliferation Assay 5 days after
plasmid transfection. Transfected cells (eGFP positive fraction) showed significant
proliferative arrest (Figure 4A) similar to Mitomycin treated cells (black). Cell cycle
analysis of SOX11 transfected cells showed an increased proportion of cells in the G2/M
phase (in red Figure 4B) as compared to eGFP negative control plasmid transfected cells.
Three additional cell lines, Z138, HBL2 and JVM2 with varying levels of intrinsic SOX11
expression were similarly treated and showed proliferation arrest and an increase in G2/M
independent of p53 status (Supplementary Figure S3A-G).

Author Manuscript

The cell cycle progression from G2 to M phase requires the activation of CDC2 (20-22). To
investigate mechanisms involved in the regulation of G2/M arrest by SOX11, we
overexpressed SOX11 in Granta-519 and Z138 cells and tested the protein level of CDC2 by
Western blotting. As expected, our result showed that CDC2 protein level reduced as early
as 24 hours after SOX11 overexpression as compared to control plasmid in Granta-519 and
Z138 cells (Figure 4C; Supplementary Figure S4).

Author Manuscript

We further confirmed that direct inhibition of WNT pathway down-stream effector
TCF/LEF activity via a dominant negative TCF4 (Dn-TCF4) construct (23) can recapitulate
the functional phenotypes of proliferation repression and G2/M arrest induced by SOX11
forced expression. Using Granta-519 (Figure 4D, 4E) and Z138 (Supplementary Figure
S5A, S5B) cell lines, we showed that DN-TCF4 transfected cells (orange) exhibited
significant proliferative arrest (Figure 4D, Supplementary Figure S5A) compared to control
plasmid transfected cells (green). Cell cycle analysis of DN-TCF4 transfected cells (orange)
showed a significantly increased proportion of cells in the G2/M phase on day 2 as
compared to eGFP negative control plasmid transfected cells (green) (Figure 4D,
Supplementary Figure S5B).

5. SOX11 expression is associated with improved overall survival in MCL patients treated
with R-HyperCVAD

We hypothesized that the repression of proliferation and cell cycle inhibition by SOX11 may
confer differential sensitivity to chemotherapy used in the clinic to treat MCL patients. To
test this hypothesis, we examined the association between SOX11 and patient outcomes in
three independent cohorts of patients from three different countries with well-annotated
treatment data. Tissue microarrays of 131 patient tumor samples were stained for SOX11
and scored by two independent pathologists. Representative TMA sections staining for
SOX11 are shown in Figure 5A. The association between SOX11 expression and overall
survival was examined via Cox proportional hazard models separately for each cohort and
treatment type (CHOP vs. R-HyperCVAD) (Figure 5B-C, Supplementary Table S5). There
was a statistically significant improvement in overall survival associated with higher SOX11
expression in patients treated with R-HyperCVAD (24) but not with CHOP (combined
cohort, SOX11 low expression hazard ratio (HR) 6.96, P<0.0004) (Figure 5B-C,
Supplementary Table S6). Kaplan-Meier plots for Karolinska cohort and UW cohort
stratified by treatments further showed a longer overall survival time in patients with high
SOX11 expression receiving R-Hyper-CVAD (Figure 5D-E). This association retained
significance following multivariate analysis incorporating MIPI and Ki67 (adjusted SOX11
low expression hazard ratio 8.02, P=0.002) (Supplementary Table S6). P53 overexpression
is associated with mutation and loss of function in MCL, and can independently predict poor
prognosis (25). SOX4 acts as a tumor suppressor in non-small cell lung carcinoma by
stabilizing p53 protein from Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation (26). We
controlled for the impact of p53 expression in combined UW and Karolinska cohorts, and
still found a statistically significant (p=0.004) association between SOX11 expression and
improved survival in R-HyperCVAD treated patients (Supplementary Table S7). Our cell
line data also showed inhibition of cell proliferation in both p53 wild type and p53 mutant
cell lines (Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure S3A, C and E), suggesting that inhibition of
MCL proliferation by SOX11 is independent of p53 status. A previous study by Wiestner et
al. (27) showed MCL tumors having a higher level of cyclin D1 mRNA expression
preferentially expressed the shorter cyclin D1a isoform and were associated with inferior
survival in patients. Our observation of the treatment specific prognostic value of SOX11
protein expression in patients receiving R-HyperCVAD appears to be independent from the
level of cyclin D1. For this, we interrogated the relationship of SOX11 and CCND1 RNA
and protein expression levels using gene expression array datasets and IHC of primary tissue
microarrays. SOX11and cyclin D1 RNA expression had a Spearman rank-order correlation
coefficient: r=0.41 p=0.008 for UNMC dataset but differed from the NCI dataset (r= 0.32,
P=0.15 for NCI dataset). Furthermore, the cyclinD1 IHC AQUA scores did not show any
correlation to the SOX11 IHC AQUA scores (Linear regression and correlation model; R2=
0.05, P=0.1; TMA data from UW).

Discussion
Our ChIP-seq results describe the target genes directly bound to by the transcription factor
SOX11 in MCL. Based on pathway analysis of the SOX11 binding targets, we predicted that
functional networks associated with SOX11 binding targets could repress proliferation. We

specifically demonstrate that the WNT signaling pathway, which controls expression of proproliferative genes such as Myc, is functionally repressed by SOX11.
WNT signaling pathway activation results in de-repression of the transcriptional activity of
downstream effectors TCF/LEF (T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor), which
subsequently regulate target genes in diverse biological contexts including stem cell
maintenance, embryonic patterning and tissue homeostasis (28). WNT signaling must be
tightly controlled as elevated β-catenin and TCF/LEF activity leads to cancer in many
tissues (29-32). Nuclear β-catenin expression and constitutively active WNT signaling have
been previously demonstrated in MCL (18) and inhibition of WNT signaling by a depletion
of WNT pathway intermediate DVL-2 by RNA interference or inhibitor of β-catenin reduces
cell proliferation in MCL cell lines (18). More recently, β-catenin-independent activation of
TCF/LEF activities has also been demonstrated in MCL (33).

The SOX transcription factors were first shown to physically interact and antagonize βcatenin activity in Xenopus embryos (34). The interaction between SOXC transcription
factors and WNT signaling has been described in colon carcinoma and other malignancies
(35, 36). The SOX11/WT1 complex has been shown to regulate WNT4 in embryonic kidney
cells (37). NLK, a SOX11 direct binding gene, is a negative regulator of WNT signaling
pathway and has been shown to down-regulate the β-catenin/T cell factor/Lymphoid
enhancer factor-1 (TCF/LEF) transcription activity via phosphorylation of TCF4 to prevent
DNA binding of the β-catenin/TCF4 complexes (11). Our functional data showing direct
repression of WNT signaling represents one pathway through which SOX11 can exert its
anti-proliferative effect in MCL. In addition to WNT, other SOX11 regulated pathways such
as TGF-beta may also contribute to its anti-proliferative effect (Figure 1C). Previous studies
(38) using promoter array based ChIP-chip have focused on plasmacytic differentiation as
one aspect of its function.
SOX11 expression is present in pre-malignant lymph nodes examined in serial biopsies
from MCL patients, suggesting that the expression of this protein is an early event in the
malignant transformation of lymphocytes in MCL (39). It belongs to the SOXC family of
high mobility group (HMG) transcription factor. HMG transcription factors are epigenetic
regulators, facilitating conformational changes in DNA structure that allow binding of other
transcription factors. It is interesting to note that the expression of SOX11 is itself controlled
by epigenetic regulation. We have found SOX11 expression to be associated with promoter
hypomethylation in both MCL cell lines and patient samples (40). SOX11 expression in
MCL has also been associated with activating histone marks (H3K9/14Ac and H3K4me3)
(41).

Previous reports suggest that lack of SOX11 is associated with an indolent disease course in
MCL (3), where patients usually present with non-nodal disease and peripheral blood
involvement and can be observed without therapy for months or years. These findings were
contrary to a well-annotated independent Swedish study (which is part of our meta-analysis)
where SOX11 was expressed in 50% of patients with indolent disease (42). Additionally,
analysis of an independent dataset from University of Wisconsin as part of our meta-analysis
similarly showed that SOX11 was expressed in a majority of patients with indolent disease

(10/11 patients were SOX11 positive). The majority of patients with indolent disease in
these two cohorts had nodal involvement. Our meta-analysis of three independent cohorts of
samples demonstrates a strong association between SOX11 and survival in R-HyperCVAD
treated patients. Intensive induction therapeutic approaches like R-HyperCVAD (24), and
the Nordic (43) regimens have been associated with improved survival in MCL but can
cause considerable morbidity from myelosuppression, infection and other chemotherapy
toxicities, particularly in older patients, which constitute the bulk of the MCL population.
Preselection of patients for intensive therapy is usually based on clinical parameters such as
age and performance status, which can be interpreted subjectively. Our results present a
unique opportunity for a bio-assay (SOX11 expression) as a way of pre-selecting patients at
higher likelihood for better survival with these intensive chemotherapy regimens in MCL.
The association of SOX11 expression and improved survival has also been seen in ovarian
epithelial tumors (44). Our results may be relevant beyond mantle cell lymphoma to the
other SOX11 expressing solid tumors, such as ovarian tumors (45), medulloblastoma (46)
and gliomas (47).
SOX11 is associated with better survival in two of three cohorts in our meta- analysis,
suggesting a strong treatment effect. The BCCA cohort (48), which did not show this
association, has more heterogeneity in treatments, as patients were collected over several
years and also has fewer patients treated with intensive therapy.

Author Manuscript

In summary, we show that SOX11 directly binds to genes in critical intracellular pathways
controlling cell cycle and proliferation in MCL. Further functional dissection using mouse
models may help us understand the role of SOX11 in MCL pathogenesis. A subset of the
SOX11 binding targets genes may identify new pathways for therapeutic intervention for the
treatment of this challenging disease. Our results showing improved survival in SOX11
overexpressing MCL patients treated with intensive chemotherapy lay the foundation for
examining SOX11 expression in prospective clinical trials, to ultimately support its routine
incorporation as a bio-assay for pre-selecting patients more likely to benefit from intensive
approaches in MCL.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation, ChIP-seq and ChIP-PCR

Author Manuscript

A total of 108 or 2-3 × 107 of cells from MCL cell lines or MCL patients, respectively, were
1% formaldehyde fixed, lysed and sonicated for 6 × 30 sec in a Bioruptor sonicator
(Diagenode, Denville, NJ, USA). Supernatants were pre-cleared with protein A/G Agarose
beads (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Chromatin fragments were immune-precipitated by
using an anti-SOX11 affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibody (HPA000536, SigmaAldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) or normal rabbit polyclonal antibody (Cell Signaling,
Danvers, MA, USA) and purified using QIAquick PCR purification columns (Qiagen,
Hilden, Germany) followed by 40 cycles of PCR amplification. Primers used for PCR are
listed in Supplementary Table S8. A total of 10 ng of amplified DNA was used to prepare
sequencing libraries using the Illumina ChIP-Seq HT Sequencing Library preparation
protocol. Sequencing was performed using Illumina HiSeq2000 system (Illumina, San
Diego, CA, USA) with each library sequenced in a 50 bases single-read run. Reads were
aligned to the Homo sapiens genome (Hg18) using Bowtie 9. Reads with more than four
matches were excluded. Peak calling was performed by using the ChIPSeeqer (50) with pvalue less than 0.01, fold change greater than 1.5 between peaks enriched by SOX11
antibody minus IgG control. Chip-seq was performed in two replicates and the genes in
common between the two were used for further network and ontogeny analysis.
Gene network, gene ontology and motif analyses

from two ChIP-seq replicates were used for KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes) pathway enrichment analysis. A hypergeometric test was used to determine the
pathways enriched in SOX11 target genes. The top 10 pathways with the most significant p
values were selected (Supplementary Figure S1A). Adjusted p-values were calculated based
on the multiple test adjustment method proposed by Benjamini and Hochberg. Homer
(Hypergeometric Optimization of Motif EnRichment) was used for motif discovery (51).

sample preparation kit (Illumina) following manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was
done on a HiSeq 2000 system using 100 bases, single-end read sequencing. All samples
obtained at least 18,000,000 raw reads with higher than 88% of the clusters passing Illumina

as described by Mortazavi et al. (53).

Statistical Method for RNA-seq data analysis
Expression levels (X) in SOX11-depleted and control samples within each MCL cell line
were compared on a gene-by-gene basis by computing the relative change in cell line
expression (defined as: D = XKO - Xcontrol/XCONTROL) and then ranked on the basis of a
one-sample t-test. False discovery rate (FDR; 54) was also computed in order to assess the
statistical significance of genes in the context of multiple testing and to quantify the
expected proportion of false positives.
Cell proliferation and cell cycle analysis

Author Manuscript

Cell proliferation was studied based on dye dilution using CellTrace™ Violet Cell
Proliferation Kit (Life Technologies) according to manufacturer instruction. 2×106 cells/ml
of MCL cells were labeled with CellTrace™ Violet at a final concentration of 4μM in PBS.
Labeled Cells were then transfected with plasmids and cultured for 72 to 120 hours. Cell
cycle analysis was performed by staining MCL cells with 4 μg/ml of Hoechst 33342 (Life
Technologies) in RPMI medium plus 10% FBS at a density of 2×106 cells/ml for 45 to 60
minutes at 37°C in the dark. 2.5 ug/ml of PI was used for dead cell discrimination. FACS
was performed using BD LSR II (Becton Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) and data
was analyzed with FlowJo (Tree Star Inc., Ashland, OR, USA). Transfected cells were gated
based on the intensity of eGFP expression.
Reporter assays

Author Manuscript

WNT pathway activity was assayed with TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH constructs. SMAD3
activity is assayed with SMAD3p-Luc (49). Reporter constructs were co-transfected with
either SOX11 plasmid or siRNA (WNT reporter assay only) and Renilla luciferase
(pGL4.74, Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Luciferase activity was assessed using Dual
Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to manufacturer instruction on
AutoLumat LB 953 Multi-Tube Luminometer and normalized to activity of Renilla
luciferase. WNT activity was expressed as the ratio of TOPFLASH/FOPFLASH.
Experiments were performed in duplicate and repeated as least twice for each cell line. NLK
reporter activity (CS-HPRM24544-PM02, Genecopoeia) was studied by contransfection

with SOX11 plasmid and analyzed by FACS. Results were represented as percentage of
reporter positive cells average from three independent experiments.
Immuno-blotting analysis
Immuno-blotting was performed following standard procedures by using primary antibodies
specific for SOX11 antibody (HPA000536), CDC2 (Cat# 9112, Cell signaling technology,
Danvers, MA, USA) and actin antibody (C-11, HRP, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa
Cruz, CA. USA).
Immunohistochemistry

Author Manuscript

Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described (55). Anti-SOX11 antibody
(HPA000536, Sigma-Aldrich) was used at 1:400 dilutions. Two independent pathologists
scored protein at 20X objective magnification. SOX11 expression was identified as strong
nuclear staining in lymphoid cells and quantified in 5% increments by visual estimation.
Ki-67 IHC was performed using Ki-67 antibody (Clone SP6, Biocare Medical). The Ki-67
index was defined as the percentage of Ki-67 positive tumor cells in representative areas of
lymphoma evaluated by one observer (DTY) counting 100 cells in two representative high
power fields at 400x magnification for each core and then averaged between the triplicate
cores for each case.
Patient cohort analysis

Author Manuscript

We estimated a Cox proportional hazards model for each cohort and treatment type (CHOP
vs. R-HyperCVAD) to examine the association between SOX11 and patient survival
(defined as the time to death or last follow-up from the initiation of therapy) in 3
independent cohorts of patients. SOX11 was categorized using an a priori cut-point of 0.54
for each model. An exhaustive evaluation of all potential cut-points was performed for each
cohort in order to validate the initial a priori selection. Cut-points in the range of 45% to
60% were similar with respect to the resulting association between the categorized SOX11
and overall survival. Furthermore, treating SOX11 as a continuous covariate resulted in
similar findings within each cohort and treatment type. Multivariable cohort-stratified Cox
PH models were estimated using the combined data set in order to examine the effect of
SOX11 on survival after adjustment for other clinically relevant covariates (MIPI, ki67, and
p53 status).
Forest plots using the rmeta package (version 2.14, R) were created in order to display
cohort and treatment-specific hazard ratios along with corresponding 95% confidence
intervals. The effect of SOX11 was estimated using cohort-stratified models.
