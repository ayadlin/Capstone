ABSTRACT
The inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling by Gefitinib
provides a promising treatment strategy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC);
however, drug resistance to Gefitinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors presents
a major issue. Using NSCLC cell lines with differential EGFR status, we examined the
potency of PA-MSHA (Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin) in
combination with Gefitinib on proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, EGFR signaling
and tumor growth. PC-9, A549, and NCI-H1975 cells were treated with PA-MSHA,
Gefetinib, or PA-MSHA plus Gefetinib at different concentrations and times. The effects
of the drugs on proliferation, cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were evaluated.
The activation of EGFR and apoptotic signaling-related molecules was evaluated by
Western blotting in the presence or absence of EGFR siRNA. Tumor growth and pathway
signaling activation was assessed by xenografts in nude mice. A time-dependent and
concentration-dependent cytotoxic effect of PA-MSHA was observed in all NSCLC cells
tested. The combination of PA-MSHA plus Gefitinib enhanced the growth inhibition,
sub-G1 content and apoptosis over that observed with either agent alone. Furthermore,
the combination of PA-MSHA plus Gefitinib resulted in caspase-3/caspase-9 cleavage
and increased inhibition of EGFR-dependent activation of AKT and ERK phosphorylation.
Combination treatment was more effective in reducing tumor size and EGFR activation
than either agent alone. These data suggest that PA-MSHA and Gefitinib function
additively to suppress the proliferative effects of NSCLC cells of differential EGFR status.
The combination of PA-MSHA and Gefitinib provides a potential new strategy to conquer
drug resistance for anti-EGFR-targeted therapy of NSCLC.

over 25% of cancer-related deaths, although there has been a
slight decrease in mortality and incidence [1]. Approximately
85% of lung cancer patients have non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). For early stage NSCLC, adjuvant chemotherapy
is effective at improving patient disease-free survival (DFS)

elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines, S. pyogenes also
shows direct lytic activity against tumor cells.
Pseudomonas Aeruginosa injection is a type of
therapeutic biological product approved in China for
adjuvant treatment of patients with malignant tumors.
This product is made from an inactivated mutant strain
of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-MSHA) that is
characterized by rich mannose-sensitive hemagglutination
pili (type 1 fimbriae). PA-MSHA has been successfully
used in clinical cancer therapy for many years, although
its detailed mechanism of action remains unclear. In recent
studies, PA-MSHA has been shown to directly inhibit
tumor cell proliferation in vitro and induce apoptosis in
human hepatocarcinoma, nasopharyngeal cancer and
breast cancer cells [20, 21]. Interestingly, an in-depth study
demonstrated that the mannose-mediated EGFR signaling
pathway is involved in the apoptosis of breast cancer cells
(MDA-MB-231HM and MDA-MB-468) induced by PAMSHA [22]. These results imply the potential therapeutic
value of PA-MSHA in tumors typically associated with
EGFR over-expression and mutations.
In this study, to examine the effects of PA-MSHA
we selected three different NSCLC cell lines based on their
different gene-expression status: A549 is an EGFR wild
type cell line with primary EGFR-TKI resistance, PC-9 is
an EGFR-TKI-sensitive cell line with an exon 19 deletion
mutation, and NCI-H1975 is an acquired EGFR-TKIresistant cell line with T790M and L858R mutations. To
evaluate the potential of PA-MSHA to assist in overcoming
EGFR-TKI drug resistance, we observed the cell growth
inhibition, apoptosis induction, and cell cycle redistribution of
these three cell lines after administration of PA-MSHA alone
or in combination with Gefitinib. Our results suggest that the
use of a combination PA-MSHA and Gefitanib represents a
possible tool in an adjuvant or metastatic setting for NSCLC.

and overall survival (OS). For advanced-stage NSCLC,
however, the response rate is only approximately 30% and
the median OS of metastatic NSCLC is only approximately
12 months, despite the use of chemotherapy as first-line
treatment [2].
The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a
proto-oncogene regulating cell proliferation, metastasis,
and angiogenesis [3]. Abnormalities in EGFR are known
to induce a strong oncogenic potential in NSCLC [4].
Tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific to EGFR (EGFR
TKIs) are used in second-line and even first-line therapy
in patients with metastatic NSCLC. Gefitinib and erlotinib
are first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors
(TKIs) that block the EGFR signaling pathway through
reversible binding to EGFR [5]. However, the limitation
of this treatment is the EGFR gene-mutation status [6].
In patients with EGFR mutations, such as the exon 19 inframe deletion or exon 21 L858R point mutation, the initial
response to first-generation EGFR TKIs is approximately
80%. Unfortunately, almost all patients acquire resistance to
these agents. For 50% of these patients, resistance is derived
by the occurrence of a secondary T790M mutation in exon
20 of the EGFR [7]. Recently, second-generation EGFR
TKIs that inhibit EGFR activity by irreversibly binding
to EGFR have been clinically developed and have shown
promising anti-tumor activity in NSCLC [8]. However,
these irreversible EGFR TKIs are over 100-fold less potent
in NSCLC cells with the EGFR T790M mutation than in
NSCLC cells with the EGFR exon 19 in-frame deletion
mutation [9, 10]. A recent clinical study emphasized the
limited effects of these second-generation agents, which
suggests the necessity for developing a new strategy for
overcoming EGFR TKIs resistance in NSCLC [11].
The interaction of humans with bacteria is among
the most interesting investigative fields. It has been clearly
established over the last few decades that chronic bacterial
infections may contribute to carcinogenesis. Conversely, a
less-obvious application of bacteria and bacteria-derived
products is their use in protecting human beings from
various malignant diseases. It is well known that bacteria
mediate antitumor activities not only by indirect immune
activation but also by direct tumoricidal effects [12–14].
For instance, a genetically modified strain of Salmonella
typhimurium A1-R, which is auxotrophic for leu-arg and
has high anti-tumor virulence, can infect tumor cells and
directly cause nuclear destruction. This bacterium has been
successfully used to eradicate metastases in orthotopic
models of prostate, breast, and pancreatic cancer, both
after local and systemic administration [15–18]. Another
important example of bacterial anti-tumor action is S.
pyogenes, which binds directly to target cells via fibronectin
or collagen and eventually leads to the induction of the
apoptotic process in tumor cells with complete regression
of established pancreatic tumors after a single application
of live S. pyogenes [19]. Although the antitumor effect
is accompanied by massive leukocyte infiltration and

RESULTS
Effect of PA-MSHA in combination with
Gefitinib on the proliferation of NSCLC cell lines
To investigate the effect of PA-MSHA alone and in
combination with Gefitinib, we examined three human
NSCLC cell lines with varying genetic EGFR status
and differential corresponding sensitivity to EGFRTKIs: PC-9 (sensitive), A549 (primary resistant), and
NCI-H1975 (acquired resistant). As expected, proliferation
was inhibited with increasing doses of Gefitinib, but the
inhibition rate was higher for PC-9 cells than for A549
or NCI-H1975 cells. However, PA-MSHA produced
substantial dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition
in all three cell lines, regardless of their sensitivity to
Gefitinib. Combining various concentrations of PA-MSHA
with 0.125 μM Gefitinib resulted in more pronounced
growth inhibition than Gefitinib alone, particularly for
A549 and NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 1A). To determine

whether the effect is synergistic, 0.125 μM of Gefitinib
plus 0.313×109/ml of PA-MSHA were compared with
Gefitinib or PA-MSHA alone. As shown in Figure 1B, for
all three NSCLC cell lines, the proliferation rates for PAMSHA combined with Gefitinib were significantly lower
than those for Gefitinib or PA-MSHA alone (P<0.05), with
the possible exception of A549 cells at 24 hours. These
results indicate that PA-MSHA enhances the growth
inhibition by Gefitinib of NSCLC cells, especially for
EGFR-TKI-resistant A549 and NCI-H1975 cells.

can enhance the effects of Gefitinib on NSCLC cell
apoptosis, cells were treated for 12 hours with PA-MSHA,
Gefitinib, or Gefitinib in combination with increasing
doses of PA-MSHA and then were stained with annexin
V/PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 3A and
3B). Whereas apoptosis was increased to some extent
for all three cell lines after treatment with PA-MSHA,
Gefitinib only promoted an obvious level of apoptosis
(26.7%) in PC-9 cells. Furthermore, for all three NSCLC
cell lines, the percentages of apoptosis in the PA-MSHA
plus Gefitinib group were significantly increased in a PAMSHA concentration-dependent manner, suggesting that
the effect of the drug combination occurs regardless of the
EGFR-TKI resistance status.
The caspase family proteins were examined to
investigate the underlying mechanism of apoptosis
induced by Gefitinib, PA-MSHA, and their combination.
The lysates were analyzed using antibodies against
caspase-3, caspase-9, and their active cleaved forms. With
PA-MSHA alone, the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and
-9 proteins was observed in all three cell lines, but with
Gefitinib alone, cleaved caspase-3 and -9 proteins were
only observed in PC-9 cells, potentially due to the EGFRTKI resistance of A549 and NCI-H1975 cells. However,
in combination with Gefitinib, PA-MSHA induced a dosedependent increase in cleaved caspase-3 and -9 in A549
and NCI-H1975 cells (Figure 3C). These results verify
that treatment with PA-MSHA can reverse the EGFR-TKI
resistance of NSCLC cell lines.

Effect of PA-MSHA in combination with
Gefitinib on the redistribution of the cell cycle in
NSCLC cell lines
To determine whether the effects of Gefitinib and
PA-MSHA on cell proliferation might be explained
in part by effects on the cell cycle, cells were treated
with PA-MSHA, Gefitinib or Gefitinib plus increasing
doses of PA-MSHA for 12 hours and then were stained
with PI and analyzed by flow cytometry (Figure 2A and
2B). PA-MSHA alone arrested cells in the G1 phase
(Sub and G0/G1) and decreased the proportion of cells
in the S phase. Furthermore, Gefitinib alone promoted
a significant increase in the proportion of PC-9 cells in
the G0/G1 phase and a reduction in the proportion in
the G2/M phase, though the effects were less obvious
for A-549 and NCI-H1975 cells. However, Gefitinib in
combination with PA-MSHA resulted in a more potent cell
cycle redistribution effect, especially for the EGFR-TKIresistant A-549 and NCI-H1975 cells. In all three NSCLC
cell lines, combination treatment at a range of doses of PAMSHA as compared with Gefitinib alone (P<0.05) led to
an increased proportion of cells in the Sub-G1 phase and
a decreased proportion of cells in the S or G2/M phases.
We further evaluated the effects of this drug
combination by examining levels of RB, E2F-1, P21, and
Cyclin E, each of which have established roles in cell
cycle regulation. PA-MSHA alone had minimal effects on
the levels of these proteins in PC-9, A549, and NCI-H1975
cells. Furthermore, the effects of Gefitinib alone were
only observed for PC-9 cells, which showed a modest
but reproducible increase in RB, E2F-1, and P21, with
a decrease in Cyclin E. However, regardless of EGFRTKI sensitivity, Gefitinib combined with PA-MSHA
significantly increased RB, E2F-1, and P21 expression and
decreased Cyclin E expression (Figure 2C). These results
are consistent with an effect of PA-MSHA in enhancing
cell cycle arrest by Gefitinib.

Effect of PA-MSHA in combination with
Gefitinib on EGFR signaling
To characterize whether the growth inhibition
induced by Gefitinib and PA-MSHA might involve effects
on EGFR signaling, we examined the expression of several
key regulators that function within the EGFR signaling
pathway. As shown in Figure 4, PA-MSHA had little or no
effect on the expression of p-EGFR, p-AKT, and p-ERK.
Gefitinib alone promoted a reduction in the expression of
these phosphorylated proteins in PC-9, but not A549 and
NCI-H1957 cells. Moreover, the combination of Gefitinib
and increasing doses of PA-MSHA further reduced the
expression of phosphorylated proteins with minimal effect
on the total protein levels in PC-9, as well as EGFR-TKIresistant A549 and NCI-H1975 cells. These results suggest
that EGFR signaling may play an important role in the
combined effects of PA-MSHA with Gefitinib, especially
for EGFR-TKI-resistant NSCLC.
To verify the role of EGFR signaling in PA-MSHA/
Gefitinib treatment, we used siRNA to reduce EGFR
levels by RNA interference. As shown in Figure 5A and
5B, the siRNA was ~80% effective in reducing EGFR
protein levels at 72 hours post-transfection in the three
cell lines (P<0.05). A similar reduction in EGFR and
p-EGFR levels was observed after an additional 48 hours

Effect of PA-MSHA in combination with
Gefitinib on apoptosis

induce early and late apoptosis in A-549, PC-9, and

the suppression of EGFR signaling.

DISCUSSION
To date, no approved therapies exist for metastatic
NSCLC patients who fail first generation reversible
EGFR-TKIs. The most common mechanisms of
resistance to Gefitinib and Erlotinib therapies are wild
type EGFR status (primary resistance) or development
of a secondary gatekeeper mutation, T790M (acquired
resistance). Although Afatinib was expected to overcome
EGFRT790M-mediated acquired resistance to firstgeneration reversible EGFR TKIs, a recent phase III
study of Afatinib failed to demonstrate overall survival
improvement in Gefitinib or Erlotinib-resistant patients,
with a response rate of less than 10% [10]. Therefore, the
treatment options for NSCLC remain unsatisfactory.
In this study, we sought to determine whether PAMSHA might reverse the drug resistance of EGFR-TKIs
in NSCLC. We evaluated the anti-cancer effects in vitro
and in vivo to three different genotypes of NSCLC cell
lines by Gefitinib in combination with PA-MSHA. Our
data show that Gefitinib plus PA-MSHA can inhibit cell
proliferation, redistribute the cell cycle, induce apoptosis
and inhibit tumor growth in PC-9, A549, and NCI-H1975
cells. These results are supported by the reduced tumor
growth in xenotransplanted nude mice after combination
treatment. This phenomenon suggests that PA-MSHA can
recover the sensitivity of Gefitinib in EGFR-TKI-resistant
cells.
Previous in vitro studies reported that PA-MSHA
alone can directly inhibit proliferation of breast cancer
cells and gastric cancer cells [21–23]. We have extended

Effect of PA-MSHA in combination with
Gefitinib on tumor growth
To determine whether the combination of Gefitinib
plus PA-MSHA is effective in reducing NSCLC
tumor growth in vivo, we assessed tumor growth after
transplantation of PC-9, A549, and NIC-H1975 cells
into nude mice. Consistent with the in vitro results, the
administration of Gefitinib reduced the growth only
for PC-9 cells, while PA-MSHA reduced the growth to
some extent for all three NSCLC cell lines. Furthermore,
Gefitinib plus PA-MSHA was the most effective in
reducing the tumor volume for all three cell lines, with
80–70% reduction (Figure 6A).
To assess the in vivo effects of the drug combination
on apoptotic and EGFR signaling pathway proteins, we
preformed Western blotting of lysates from excised tumor
xenografts after treatment. Consistent with the in vitro
results, an increase in cleaved caspase-3 and -9 were
observed for all three types of xenografts by treatment
with Gefitinib plus PA-MSHA (Figure 6B). Additionally,
there was a trend toward a significantly lower level
of pEGFR, pAKT, and pERK in tumor issues from the
combination group (Figure 6C). These results confirm the
in vitro results suggesting that PA-MSHA enhances the

these findings to NSCLC, and have also demonstrated that
Gefitinib plus PA-MSHA is more effective than Gefitinib
or PA-MSHA alone at decreasing the proliferation of
PC-9, A549, and NCI-H1975 cells. On the basis of this
phenomenon, we deduce that PA-MSHA may have
synergistic effects with Gefitinib. Our data suggest that the
growth suppression and cell death induced by PA-MSHA
may occur despite the EGFR gene mutation status.
Consistent with previous results [20–22], a
decrease in the S phase population and an increase in the
sub-G1 population were observed in PA-MSHA-treated
cells. When using Gefitinib plus PA-MSHA, these
effects were enhanced to some extent. Western blots
demonstrated that RB, P21, and E2F-1 increased more
apparently in all three cell lines after treatment with
Gefitinib combined with PA-MSHA, which provides
an explanation of why the cells arrested in the sub-G1
phase [24]. Conversely, Cyclin E, which plays a major
positive role in the G0/G1 switch to S phase [25, 26],
decreased more apparently. Therefore, the efficacy of the
combination of Gefitinib and PA-MSHA may be derived
in part from effects on molecular regulators that mediate
G0/G1 arrest.
Earlier data demonstrated that apoptosis activated
via caspases plays a critical role in the carcinogenesis,
pathogenesis, etiology, and therapy of several human
malignancies [20–22, 27]. Apoptosis has been shown to
be initiated and executed through two main pathways,
the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway [28, 29]. In the
intrinsic pathway, also called mitochondrial pathway,
downstream cleavage of caspase-9 and caspase-3 is
activated [29, 30]. Our data demonstrate that apoptosis
of NSCLC cells induced by PA-MSHA alone or in
combination with Gefitinib is mediated directly via
caspase-3 and -9, suggesting that the intrinsic pathway
mediated by mitochondria may play an important role in
the apoptosis triggered by the two drugs in combination.
These results were confirmed using an in vivo xenograft
model, further supporting the potential role of apoptosis
following treatment with the Gefitinib and PA-MSHA in
combination.
The EGFR signaling pathway plays a critical role in
proliferation, invasion, and survival in the development
and progression of NSCLC [3, 4]. PI3K/Akt/mTOR
and RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK are two main downstream
pathways of EGFR signaling. In this study, EGFR, Akt,
ERK, and their phosphorylated forms were selected for
examination as potential mediators of Gefitinib and/or
PA-MSHA signaling through the EGFR in NSCLC. In
PC-9 and NCI-H1975 cells, Gefitinib alone can inhibit
the EGFR signal pathway; however, when PA-MSHA was
used in combination with Gefitinib, EGFR inhibition was
observed in all three NSCLC cell lines, both in vitro and
in vivo. Our data suggest that PA-MSHA may provide a
new gateway toward overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance in
NSCLC.

Our above results showed the gefitinib and PAMSHA could suppress EGFR-mediated p-AKT and
p-ERK pathway in three lung cancer cell lines, including
A549. However, since the expression of EGFR is much
lower in A549 cells than other lung cancer cells [31], it
is possible that PA-MSHA inhibit the activities of AKT
or ERK of A549 through other pathways rather than
EGFR signaling. A recent study demonstrated that PAMSHA could directly induce G0-G1 cell cycle arrest of
the cancer cells [32], suggesting the combination of PAMSHA and gefitinib inhibits lung cancer cell proliferation
through an EGFR independent pathway. In addition, PAMSHA has been reported to induce endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) stress in breast cancer cell lines through the IRE1
signaling pathway [33] indicating that combination of PAMSHA and tyrosine kinase inhibitors may promote cancer
cells apoptosis through up-regulation of the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) stress-induced apoptosis pathways. In
our next project, we will focus on detailed mechanisms
through which PA-MSHA plus TKI could enforce a
synergistically inhibitory effect on lung cancer cells”
PA-MSHA has been shown to directly inhibit tumor
cell proliferation in vitro and induce apoptosis in human
hepatocarcinoma, nasopharyngeal cancer and breast
cancer cells [31]. However, the molecular mechanisms
are still under investigation. Gefitinib blocks signal
transduction pathways responsible for the proliferation and
survival of cancer cells. In addition, evidences suggest that
there might be crosstalk of signal pathways down stream
of gefitinib and PA-MSHA. It has been reported that PAMSHA induces significant cell proliferation inhibition
and cell cycle arrest of hepatocarcinoma cells through
decreasing the levels of cyclins D1, cyclins E, CDK2,
CDK4, and increasing the level of p21 and p27 [32]. The
similar inhibitory effects on cancer cell cycle by gefitinib
through increased expression of p27(Kip1) cyclindependent kinase inhibitor and decreased expression of
aurora B have been reported [34]. Moreover, PA-MSHA
could inhibit Akt/IκBβ/NF-κB pathway, which are wellstudied downstream signals of EGFR. Taken together,
previous publication and our study suggest there is
crosstalk of signal pathways down stream of gefitinib and
PA-MSHA.
There are still some limitations of our study.
First, we did not investigate one mechanism of acquired
resistance of EGFR-TKIs-c-MET gene amplification—
either alone or coexisting with other mutations, such as
T790 M. Second, the crosstalk effect of the EGFR pathway
and other signaling pathways need to be verified with
detailed experiments. Nevertheless, these results provide
the foundations for further work to specify mechanisms of
cross-talk between these two pathways, including effects
on potential unknown targets.
In conclusion, our data demonstrate for the first
time that Gefitinib in combination PA-MSHA promotes
anti-proliferation, cell cycle redistribution, apoptosis

were treated for 12 hours with PA-MSHA alone (0.156,
0.313, 0.625, or 1.25×109/ml), Gefitinib alone (8, 4, 2,
1, 0.5, 0.25, or 0.125 μM), or 0.125 μM Gefitinib plus
PA-MSHA (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.313, or 0.156×109/
ml). Subsequently, cells were subjected to an annexin V/
propidium iodide (PI) dual staining assay according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Stained cells were analyzed with
a fluorescence activating cell sorter (Becton Dickinson,
CA, USA), and the percentage of apoptotic cells was
determined using ModFit LT 3.0 software (Becton
Dickinson, CA, USA).

Cell lines, materials, and antibodies
Human NSCLC cell lines (PC-9, A-549, and
NCI-H1975) were obtained from the American Type
Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA). The
PC-9 cell line has a high sensitivity for EGFR-TKIs and
an exon 19 deletion; A549 is a primary cell line resistant
to EGFR-TKIs with wild-type EGFR; and NCI-H1975 has
acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs with T790M (exon 20)
and L858R (exon 21) point mutations. All cell lines were
cultured in DMEM medium (Gibco, San Francisco, CA,
USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated (56°C, 30
minutes) fetal calf serum (PAA, Pasching, KA, Austria), 2
mmol/L glutamine, penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin
(100 μg/ml) (Gibco). The cells were cultured at 37°C with
5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere.
The strain of PA-MSHA used in this study was
kindly provided by Wanter Biopharma Company (Beijing,
China). The PA-MSHA was scale-cultured at 37°C for
24 h, inactivated by a chemical method and purified by
centrifugation.
Primary rabbit or mouse antibodies against the
proteins were from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers,
MA, USA): caspase-3 (#9662), caspase-9 (#9502), EGF
receptor (1F4) (#2239), phospho-EGF receptor (Thr669)
(D2F1) (#8808), Akt (#9272), phospho-Akt (Ser473)
(#9271), p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (137F5) (#4695),
phospho-p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204)
(#9101), p21 Waf1/Cip1 (DCS60) (#2946), Rb (4H1)
(#9309), Cyclin E1 (HE12) (#4129), E2F-1 (#3742), and
GAPDH (14C10) (#2118).

Western blotting
Cells were directly lysed in lysis buffer containing
2 M sodium chloride, 10% NP-40, 10% SDS, 1 M TrisCl, 1 g/L phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1 g/L
aprotinin and 0.01 g/L leupeptin. The cell lysates were
subjected to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and then blotted
onto polyvinyl difluoride membranes. After the membranes
were blocked with BSA for 1 hour, the expression of
various proteins was detected using primary (1/1000)
and secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish
peroxidase (1/800) and enhanced chemiluminescence
reagents (Pharmacia, Buckinghamshire, UK).

RNA interference
siRNA against EGFR or negative control
siRNA (100 nM) was transfected into A549, PC-9 and
NCI-H1975 cells according to the transfection protocol of
Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen, Shanghai, China). The
target sequences were as follows: EGFR-siRNA, sense
5’-UGA UCU GUC ACCACA UAA UUA CGG G-3’
(EGFR-HSS103114); nonspecific control siRNA, sense
5’-GGA GCU GCC CAU GAGAAA UUU-3’. Seventytwo hours after transfection, knockdown was assessed
by Western blotting of parallel transfection reactions. To
determine the effects of EGFR-siRNA on the PA-MSHAinduced down regulation of total and phosphorylated
levels of AKT and ERK, cells were transfected with

Cell proliferation
The effects of PA-MSHA on the survival of NSCLC
cells were determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. PC-9,
A549, and NCI-H1975 cells were seeded in 96-well
plates (1×104 cells/well) and then treated with PA-MSHA
alone (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.313, or 0.156×109/ml),
Gefitinib alone (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, or 0.125 μM), or
0.125 μM Gefitinib plus PA-MSHA (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25,
0.625, 0.313, or 0.156×109/ml) for different times (0,
24, 48, or 72 hours). MTT was then added to the cells

Four- to six-week-old female BALB/c-nu/nu nude
mice were purchased from the Shanghai Institute of
Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (Shanghai,
China). Tumors were initiated by subcutaneous (s.c.)
injection of 5×106 cells into the right mammary fat pad
of nude mice. The mice were randomly assigned to the
control or experimental groups. Mice were given daily s.c.
treatments of 0.1 ml PBS (control) or 0.1 ml PA-MSHA
(2.2×1010 cells/ml); and/or five days per week treatment
of Gefitinib suspended in 1% Tween 80 at 1 mg/kg/day
by oral gavage. Tumors were measured twice a week with
microcalipers, and tumor volumes were calculated using
the formula π/6×larger diameter×(smaller diameter)2. At
the end of the experiment, tumors were dissected and
snap-frozen. Total protein was extracted from the tumors
to quantify the level of proteins by Western blotting.
